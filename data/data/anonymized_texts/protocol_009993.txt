1.0 INTRODUCTION 
 
The outcome of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) in 
patients ≥55 years still remains unsatisfactory, with a low complete remission (CR) rate 
and poor overall survival (OS) due to a variety of reasons including increased incidence of poor -risk cytogenetics, increased activation of RAS, Src, and TNF pathways and 
intrinsic resistance of leukemic blasts to therapeutic agents. The 30- day induction 
mortality is also high and ranges from 10- 50% and this is due to prolonged 
pancytopenia, febrile neutropenia and other systemic side effects that burden the 
already aging patient with comorbidities. [1-3]. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation 
(alloSCT) has curative potential; however, it is associated with severe graft -versus -host 
disease (GVHD), infections, and other treatment related morbidities or mortality for a 
high proportion of elderly patients [ 4, 5]. Thus, recent work has centered on less toxic 
ways to manipulate donor cells to achieve antitumor benefits.  
 
A pilot study performed in China in elderly patients with AML treated with conventional chemotherapy followed by infusion of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) mismatched G - 
CSF mobilized peripheral blood stem cell infusion (G -PBSC) reported higher CR and 
disease- free-survival (DFS) rates, faster neutrophil and platelet recovery, and no GVHD 
or increase in treatment -related mortality [6]. Interestingly, although no patients 
exhibited full or mixed chimerism, donor microchimerism was monitored and observed in 
all four women who had male donors (sons or brothers). This may be due to long- term 
maternal -fetal microchimerism, and studies of HLA- haploidentical allo- SCT have shown 
improved outcomes after transplantation from noninherited maternal antigen (NIMA) 
mismatched donors [7]. Improved responses after HLA- mismatched G -PBSC infusion 
may also be due to natural killer (NK) cells: infusion of haploidentical NK cells from killer immunoglobulin- like receptor (KIR) ligand mismatched donors have shown alloreactivity 
against leukemia [8, 9]. Because induction and consolidation chemotherapy followed by 
infusion of HLA -haploidentical cells, or donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI), is a new 
procedure, our first priority is to replicate the above study as a Phase I trial to assess 
safety.  
 
Our primary hypothesis  is that chemotherapy followed by infusion of HLA -haploidentical 
DLI from KIR -ligand mismatched donors is a safe procedure that will not cause GVHD or 
increased treatment -related mortality. We further believe that this will improve outcomes 
of elderly patients with high -risk AML or MDS compared to chemotherapy alone, and  
that that this benefit will be even greater in donor -recipient pairs that share maternal -fetal 
microchimerism  or NIMA -mismatch. A large part of this trial will include immune function 
assays as well as assessments of efficacy, toxicity, and GVHD. Because this therapy may be a tolerable alternative to alloHSCT for elderly patients, we will validate functional 
meas urements (e.g. Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA)) with biologic 
correlates (cytokine and genomic profiles) and clinical  outcomes.

conventional induction and consolidation chemotherapy in terms of one- year 
DFS.

2.2.2 : Evaluate incidence and severity of other adverse events.  
 
2.2.3 : Evaluate efficacy with respect to CR and OS. 
 
2.2.4 : Evaluate immune  recovery.  
 
2.2.5 : Evaluate hematopoietic  recovery.  
 
3.0 BACKGROUND 
 
3.1 High -Risk AML and MDS in the Elderly  
Elderly AML and MDS patients have long been known to have much worse 
rates of CR, DFS, and OS compared to their younger counterparts [ 1, 3]. The 
CR rates in elderly AML patients treated with standard induction chemotherapy (7+3, i.e. 7 days of cytarabine and 3 days of anthracycline) is  
~30-65%, with more than half of these patients relapsing within six months [1, 
10], and survival in high- risk MD S is only 26 months vs. 141 months for very 
low risk [11]. In part, this is because elderly patients are less likely to have 
favorable cytogenetics: an analysis of 1065 elderly patients with AML found 7% to have favorable cytogenetics, 73% intermediate, and 20% poor, with 
complete remission rates of 72%, 53 -63%, and 26% respectively, and five- 
year overall survival rates of 34%, 10 -15%, and 2% respectively [ 12]. 
However, even with favorable cytogenetics, patients older than 65 have poor outcomes with <10% two -year overall survival [1].  
 
3.2 Stem Cell Transplant for Elderly High- Risk AML and MDS 
Nonmyeloablative or reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) allogeneic stem cell 
transplantation (alloSCT) does have curative potential for elderly patients  with 
AML and MDS; however, it is associated with severe graft -versus -host 
disease (GVHD), infections, and organ toxicity that may lead to unacceptably high rates of morbidity and mortality [4, 5, 13]. Further, the lack of an 
available human leukocyte antigen (HLA) –matched donor remains a ma jor 
obstacle for many patients. Haploidentical transplantation may provide a larger pool of available donors, but it is limited by significant morbidity and 
mortality (e.g., GVHD and infections) [14]. DLI can also mediate strong graft - 
versus -leukemia (GVL) effects but may be associated with severe GVHD and 
delayed neutrophil recovery after alloSCT [15, 16]. 
Protocol Version: 7/10/2017  
Page 7  of 42  Chemo with Adoptive Haplo DLI   
  
3.3 Graft versus Leukemia (GVL)  Effect  
Most patients with hematologic malignancies are not cured with standard 
chemotherapy. Outcomes are improved by alloSCT, which can induce an 
immunologic effect against the cancer. In patients with leukemia, this has been termed a graft versus leukemia effect. Evidence for this includes:  
 
1. temporal relationship between graft versus host disease and hematologic remission  [17] 
2. reduced incidence of leukemic relapse after alloSCT compared to syngeneic SCT [18] 
3. reduc ed incidence in leukemic relapse in alloSCT recipients who do 
develop GVHD compared to those who do not  [19] 
 
Multiple laboratory studies have been published in support of this clinical data as well. Tumor specific antigens, histocompatibility antigens, and killer 
immunoglobulin receptors (KIR) may play a role through direct cell contact, 
activating NK cells, or indirect production of cytotoxic cytokines (interferon , 
TNF-alpha, IL- 2, IL12).  
 
3.4 Donor Leukocyte Infusions as a way to Induce GVL  Effect  
Recent work with patients who have relapsed or have persistent disease post-alloSCT has centered on using donor leukocyte infusions to stimulate 
more graft versus tumor effect and re -attain remission [20, 21]. Reports are 
growing of clinically significant results in various types of malignant and non- 
malignant processes, and it is now the standard of care to proceed with donor 
leukocyte infusions in patients who have relapsed disease post allogeneic 
transplantation [ 22]. 
 
For non -selected DLIs, donors are asked to provide peripheral blood 
progenitor cells in the same manner as for transplantation; these are then transfused through a peripheral intravenous line into the recipient. Typically, 
somewhere between 10
5 to 106 CD3+  T cells/kg recipient weight are infused 
over 1 to 2 days every 4- 12 weeks, though there is no set standard. Although 
higher doses are associated with increased anti -tumor immunity, they are 
also associated with increased GVHD. The time between infusions allows for 
observation and management of pancytopenia, the anticipated side effect if 
significant graft versus tumor effects is encountered along with suppressive effects on the patient’s innate hematopoiesis. Immunosuppressive agents are 
continued during leukocyte infusions; however, if clinically significant graft 
versus host disease does occur, treatment may be initiated to control the 
degree of response at that  time
. 
 
3.5 NK Alloreactivity  
Donor-versus -recipient NK alloreactivity has emerged as a crucial factor for 
the outcome of haploidentical SCT [8]. Alloreactivity is mediated by KIR - 
ligand mismatch between donor and recipient [ 23]. Ruggeri et al showed a 
low relapse risk for patients with acute myeloid leukemia transplanted from 
NK-alloreactive donors [ 9]. Further, adoptive transfer of alloreactive 
haploidentical NK cells has been shown to be safe and effective in treatment  
Protocol Version: 7/10/2017  
Page 8  of 42  Chemo with Adoptive Haplo DLI   
  
 
of AML [ 24, 25]. NK -enriched DLI may also improve outcomes and immune 
recovery [ 26]. 
 
3.6 NIMA and Maternal -Fetal  Microchimerism  
Outcomes after HLA -haploidentical allo- SCT are better when using the 
patient’s mother as the donor compared to the father [ 7, 27, 28]. This is 
thought to be secondary to in- utero exposure of NIMA, leading to the 
establishment of long -term maternal -fetal microchimerism, which can be 
found in 40% of adults [ 29] and lead to both tolerogenic as well as sensitizing 
effects [30, 31]. One study by Stern et al found the five- year event -free 
survival rate was 50% in patient s who had transplants from their mother 
versus 11% for those who had transplants from their father, in large part due 
to reduced incidence of relapse, thought secondary to improved graft -versus - 
leukemia[ 27]. Maternal -fetal microchimerism may also mediate a graft - 
versus -leukemia effect in cord blood transplantation [ 32]. Thus, adoptive 
transfer of cells from mother to child or child to mother may improve 
outcomes.  
 
3.7 Infusion of HLA -mismatched peripheral blood stem cells in elderly AML 
A recent Chinese study reported that mice infused with a high dose of G - 
CSF–mobilized allogeneic spleen cells (3- 12 x107) after cytarabine 
chemotherapy exhibited rapid hematopoietic recovery and persistent 
microchimerism without GVHD despite  absence of GVHD prophylaxis and 
immunosuppressive treatment [6]. On the basis of these observations, they 
designed a clinical control study to investigate the eff ects of G- PBSC 
combined with conventional induction and intensive postremission 
chemotherapy on outcomes of AML in elderly patients. Fifty -eight AML 
patients aged 60 -88 years were randomly assigned to receive induction 
chemotherapy with cytarabine and mitoxantrone (control group; n=28) or 
same chemotherapy plus HLA -mismatched G -PBSCs (G -PBSC group; n=30) 
(median CD3+ cell dose: 0.9 x 10E8 CD3+ cells/kg recipient body weight). Patients who achieved CR received another 2 cycles of postremission 
therapy with i ntermediate- dose cytarabine plus G -PBSCs. The complete 
remission rate was significantly higher in the G -PBSC group than in the 
control group (80.0% vs. 42.8%; P= .006). The median recovery times of 
neutrophils and platelets in the G -PBSC group were 11 days  and 14.5 days, 
respectively, and 16 days and 20 days in the control group. The 2 year probability of disease- free survival was significantly higher in the G -PBSC 
group than in the control group (38.9% vs. 10.0%; P =.01). No graft -versus - 
host disease was observed in any  patient.  
 
Given that none of these patients experience engraftment, yet there was a significant improvement in disease free survival, we hypothesize that these results were due to infused donor lymphocytes rather than CD34+ stem cells. 
As a result, G -PBSC may not be necessary and HLA- haploidentical DLI 
would suffice.  
 
3.8 Geriatric  assessment  
To better understand the mechanisms that contribute to the poor prognosis of  
Protocol Version: 7/10/2017  
Page 9  of 42  Chemo with Adoptive Haplo DLI   
  
 
elderly AML patients, our laboratory has demonstrated that differences in the 
underlying biology (higher probability of Src, TNF, and RAS pathway 
activation in elderly AML patients as compared to their younger counterparts) contribut e to poor survival[ 33]. We will build on this knowledge by using the 
CGA to improve our clinical assessment of functional status in elderly AML and MDS patients to predict responses to and toxicity from induction therapy 
as well as mortality and correlate these results with biologic markers of frailty 
using cytokine and genomic profiles.  
 
4.0 RATIONALE  
 
Elderly patients with high -risk AML and MDS respond very poorly to conventional 
induction regimens and have high relapse rates. AlloSCT is one way of decreasing relapse but at the cost of toxicity and GVHD. Infusion of HLA - 
haploidentical stem cells may provide an alternate means of inducing a graft - 
versus -leukemia effect with less toxicity. This may be mediated by NK - 
alloreactivity and potentiated by maternal -fetal microchimerism. Our trial will 
attempt to confirm the safety and efficacy of the Chinese study in an attempt to improve 2- year survival in elderly high- risk AML and MDS patients, with minimal 
toxicity and GVHD, with a focus on immunological correlates and function in an attempt to further understand the mechanism of this phenomenon.  
 
We have selected the dose of 1 x 10E8 CD3+ cells/kg recipient body weight 
based on the success of this dose in the study by Guo et. al.[ 6] and the use of 1 
x 10E8 – 2 x 10E8 CD3+ cells/kg recipient body weight by Colvin et. al. in a 
similar study [34]. In both the Guo and Colvin studies, GVHD was not seen at this 
dose.

6.0 TREATMENT PLAN  
 
6.1 Prior to starting therapy 
Prior to enrollment, potential subjects will have a complete history and 
physical examination performed as well as the following required lab tests: 
CBC with differential (auto or manual), creatinine, AST, ALT, total 
bilirubin,and bone marrow biopsy with cytogenetics and molecular mutation 
studies. These should all be completed within four weeks prior to enrollment. 
Cardiopulmonary testing as per section 5.1 must be completed within eight 
weeks. Other recommended tests (not required but helpful for final analysis) 
include: CMV immune screen, LDH, uric acid, alkaline phosphatase, sodium, 
potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, glucose, total protein, albumin, calcium, 
magnesium, phosphorous.  
 
If a potential subject is awaiting the above required lab tests to assess suitability for enrollment (e.g. normal cytogenetics and FLT -3 mutation 
testing), and if WBC is elevated and/or rising, hydrea or leukapheresis may be initiated at the discretion of the treating physician. 
 
6.2 Donor priming and  apheresis  
Exam and laboratory analyses will follow current Foundation for the 
Accreditation of Cellular Therapy (FACT) standard of care accreditation 
requirements for cellular therapy practices. 
 
6.2.1 Mobilization  
Recommended mobilization includes G -CSF 8 mcg/kg subcutaneously twice 
daily for 4 days prior to stem cell collection and continuing until pheresis is  
Protocol Version: 7/10/2017  
Page 12  of 42  Chemo with Adoptive Haplo DLI   
  
 
completed.  Dose  should  be  rounded  to  nearest  vial  size. Alternative 
mobilization strategies may be employed at the investigator’s  discretion.  
 
6.2.2 Collection of cells  
General guidelines (though may be altered for program standards and 
evolving stand of care without being a violation): The goal is to collect 3 x 
108 CD3+ cells/kg recipient body weight. If, after a maximum of 2 
leukaphereses, the target collection is not reached, the treating physician 
may decide to proceed with a third collection after re- discussion with the 
patient and donor. If the goal dose is not reached, infusion will still take place if a minimum of 2x x 10
8 CD3+ cells are collected, and recovery wi ll 
be monitored as the patient will normally have autologous recovery.. The 
infusion schedule will be modified as below (6.3.4). Leukapheresed cells 
will be processed and frozen in the cryopreservation lab according to 
standard procedures, unless they are to be immediately infused into the 
patient after processing (e.g. freshly collected cells to be given following 
induction).  
 
The donor lymphocyte infusion meets criteria to be regulated solely as HCT/P instead of a drug/biologic. There is no manipulation of donor cells 
and the donor is a first or second degree relative.  
 
6.2.3 Storage and  processing 
The stem cells are processed in the Duke University Medical Center Stem 
Cell Laboratory and infused to the donor following the standard laboratory 
procedures fo r allogeneic stem cell infusions. Freshly collected cells will 
be used in the first course of treatment and donor cells will be divided into 
aliquots and cryopreserved in liquid nitrogen for subsequent infusions.  
Each infusion of the cells will be performed 1 day following each chemotherapy regimen and that day will be counted as ’day 0’. The target 
dose of CD3+ cells is 1x10^8 cells/kg (the collection goal of 3x10^8 CD3+ 
cells/kg is to obtain 1 aliquot of 1x10^8 CD3+ cell/kg for each of induction 
and consolidation2, with 1x10^8 CD3+ cell/kg saved in case of need for 
re-induction). If only 2- 3x10^8 CD3+ cell/kg is collected, then cells will 
only be given with IND1 and CON2 (IND2 may still be done, but cells will not be given). We will also monitor the total number of mononuclear, 
CD34+, CD3 -CD16+CD56+ (NK) cells, CD3+CD16+CD56+ (NKT)  cells, 
and gamma- delta T- cells infused, but the infusion dose will be calculated 
around CD3+ population. 
 
6.3 Treatment Plan  
 
6.3.1 Induction therapy  
Eligible subjects will receive induction chemotherapy with idarubicin (12 mg/m
2 intravenously for 3 days) and cytarabine (100 mg/m2 intravenously 
for 7 days) starting Day 1 and ending Day 7 as described in Figure 1.  
Patients 80 years or older may receive 2 and 5 days of idarubicin and cytarabine respectively starting Day 1 and ending Day 5 (optional, at 
physician discretion). HLA -mismatched DLI will be administered Day 9  
Protocol Version: 7/10/2017  
Page 13  of 42  Chemo with Adoptive Haplo DLI   
  
 
(DLI will occur on Day 7 for 5+2 regimen), approximately 24- 48 hours 
following completion of chemotherapy at a dose of 1x 10^8 CD3+ cells; 
however, due to logistics of planning infusions with staffing, donor 
availability, weekends/holidays, etc., it may be necessary to postpone cell 
infusion up to 96 hours, which will be allowed without being considered a 
protocol violation.  
Subjects who experience no remission or partial remission will receive a second course of the identical induction chemotherapy (IND2). IND2 should include 7+3+DLI as per IND1, but if cells are not available as per 6.2.3, chemotherapy alone can be given without being considered a 
protocol violation.  
Given the time constraints presented by the need to start induction 
chemotherapy as soon as possible, in some cases, it may not be 
logistically possible to administer cells with induction (e.g., obtaining insurance approval for clinical trial/DLI may take a while, and approval 
may not be back in time for a patient to receive cells). In these cases, 
patients would just receive standard induction chemotherapy and cells 
would be administered after CON1 in addition to CON2 (see below). 
Timing of correlative laboratory studies will be adjusted to match cell infus ion. Guo et al. have reported improved outcomes with high cell 
doses (1x 10^8 CD3+ cells/kg) administered after consolidation, even in 
patients who receive standard induction chemotherapy without cells.

6.3.2 Postremission  treatment  
Subjects who achieve a CR will receive 2 further courses of 
cytarabine postremission chemotherapy (consolidation) at 1.0 g/m2 for 
6 dosages followed by HLA- mismatched DLI after the second  
consolidation. Cytarabine will be given twice daily at 12 hour intervals 
on days 1, 3, and 5; HLA -mismatched DLI will be administered the 
day following the completion of the second consolidation (day 7) at a dose of 1x10^8 CD3+ cells, although as above, a  24-96 hour interval 
between completion of chemotherapy and infusion of cells will be allowed for logistical reasons without being considered a protocol 
violation.  
 
No cells will be given after the first consolidation, as chemotherapy 
given with the second  consolidation will likely kill any cells infused 
after the first consolidation (i.e. infusion of cells after the first 
consolidation would be costly and low -yield) (Note that while this 
argument could also be applied to cells infused after induction, Guo et 
al. showed an improvement in the CR rate from 40% to 80% with the 
use of cells with induction, which is why we plan to use cells after induction in this trial).  
 
The timing of consolidation typically takes place after count recovery, 
around 6 -12 weeks after induction, following standard protocols and 
timing for cytarabine consolidation.

6.3.3 Dose Adjustments  
Patients with Hepatic Impairment Dosing : Dosage will be modified 
depending on clinical response and degree of hepatic impairment, but 
no quantitative recommendations are available.  
 
Subjects with Renal Impairment Dosing:  
Our program follows the following guidelines: Estimate a creatinine clearance using the formula for the  estimated CrCl in ml/min: 
 
(140- age)/serum Cr x (ideal body wt/72).  
In addition, for females this value is multiplied by .85  
 
For subjects with a CrCl > 60 ml/min: No dosage adjustment.  
CrCl <= 60 ml/min: There is an increased risk of cerebellar and 
cerebral toxicity with high dose regimens. The recommended dosage adjustment will be as follows: For a serum creatinine of 1.5—1.9 mg/dl 
or increase of serum creatinine from baseline of 0.5—1. 2 mg/dl during 
treatment, the dose of cytarabine will remain 100 mg/m
2 during 
induction and be reduced to  500 mg/m2  during postremission 
therapy. For a serum creatinine ≥ 2 mg/dl or if the change in baseline 
serum creatinine was > 1.2 mg/dl, we will reduce the dose of 
cytarabine to 50 mg/m2 during induction and to 250 mg/m2 during 
postremission therapy.  
 
 
6.3.4 DLI 
Allogeneic DLI will be collected from the donor as described in section  
6.2.2. The allogeneic DLI will be infused as per current practice. 
Subjects will be given premedications including Benadryl 25 mg IV, 
and Acetaminophen 650 mg po prior to infusion. Hydrocortisone is used at the physician’s discretion.  
 
If needed, modifications to the infusion rate may be made as per 
standard practice.  
 
6.3.5 Supportive Care  
GVHD prophylaxis: GVHD prophylaxis will not be administered.  
 
Growth factor use: A growth factor of choice may be initiated at the 
treating physician’s discretion.  
 
Antibiotic prophylaxis (may be al tered to follow the treating 
physicians standard practice without affecting overall study) : 
a. Voriconazole 200 mg PO BID or Posaconazole 200 mg PO 
TID beginning at day 9 (or Day 7 for subjects receiving 5+2 
regimen) until CD4+ >200/uL or 1 year following  therapy, 
whichever occurs first. Alternatives may be substituted at the physician’s discretion.  
Protocol Version: 7/10/2017  
Page 16  of 42  Chemo with Adoptive Haplo DLI   
  
 
b. Acyclovir 400 mg PO BID beginning day 9 (or Day 7 for 
subjects receiving 5+2 regimen) until ANC > 1000/uL or  day 
+30 if a donor or  recipient is only HSV seropositive; acyclovir 
800mg PO BID will continue from day +30 through 1 year or until CD4 count is >200/uL if a donor or recipient is VZV 
seropositive.  
c. Ciprofloxacin 500mg po BID should be initiated beginning on day 9 (or Day 7 for subjects receiving 5+2 regimen) and 
continue until CD4 count >200/uL or 1 year following therapy  if 
tolerated orally. Alternative prophylactic antibiotics may be used at the physician’s  discretion.  
d. CMV monitoring will occur at baseline. The treating physicians 
may use their own test of choice for this surveillance, though a PCR based assay is recommended. A positive test 
necessitates initiating therapy per local standards (low  positive 
typically requires a repeat confirmation and a high positive imme diate initiation of anti -CMV therapy with ganciclovir or 
foscarnet).  
 
Blood products: All blood products (except DLI) will be irradiated 
following local standards to prevent possible GVHD. Hematocrit 
should be maintained at > 25%, and platelets at > 10,000 /mm3 
(subject to treating physician discretion). All blood products should be 
filtered prior to infusion  
 
Other care: Agents designed to minimize other side effects of 
transplantation such as decreasing mucositis are allowed at the 
physician’s discretion.  
 
6.4 Subject Evaluation  
6.4.1 Clinical Evaluation  
Subjects will be evaluated daily during induction and recovery from 
therapy while admitted to the hospital. Evaluation will include history 
and physical exam and toxicity monitoring, including acute GVHD 
monitoring. They will return for post -remission therapy and typically be 
re-admitted to our service for further treatment. In selected cases, 
subjects may remain outpatient with very close care and follow up per the treating team’s discretion. Upon completion of therapy, they will be 
seen at least every other week until 8 weeks, after which they will be 
seen at least every 3 months for 2 years.  
 
6.4.2 Laboratory and other  testing  
(Correl ative Studies for 00043247 v. 15.06.19 Lab Manual)  
Evaluation for supportive care during therapy/recovery and after therapy will be as follows (Recommended but may change based on clinical status per treating physician):  
(a) CBC will be obtained daily during induction until transfusions of platelets and red blood cells are not regularly required, then as 
clinically indicated. When the white count reaches greater  than 
Protocol Version: 7/10/2017  
Page 17  of 42  Chemo with Adoptive Haplo DLI   
  
 
500/uL, then add differential and follow to document when ANC > 
1,500/uL. After consolidation, CBC and differential will be checked 
every 2 weeks or as clinically indicated.  
(b) Serum chemistries and liver functioning tests at least weekly and 
as clinically indicated while during therapy/recovery; chemistries 
and liver function tests will also be checked at 8 weeks and then 
every 3 months for 2  years.  
(c) Serum quantitative beta- HCG will be checked one week prior to 
induction in females.  
(d) Biopsies of organs suspected to be involved with GVHD as 
clinically indicated (e.g., skin, liver, GI  tract). 
(e) Chest X -ray as clinically  indicated.  
(f) Bone marrow biopsy at Day 14 (per investigator discretion) as well 
as after count recovery  (mandatory)  
(g) HLA Antibodies at count recovery and 8 weeks after  CON2.  
(h) For patients who relapse or have refractory disease going off study, collect the following labs: peripheral blood for minimal 
residual disease testing, NK lysis assay, microchimerism, TCR 
sequencing, PD1/PDL1/PDL2 expression.  
 
6.4.3 Detection of donor chimerism and microchimerism: 
Hematopoietic donor chimerism will be assessed in all subjects 
with the use of standard cytogenetic and semiquantitative PCR - 
based analysis of short tandem repeats with 1% sensitivity. Microchimerism will b e analyzed using real time PCR (qPCR) at a 
sensitivity of 1/100,000.  
These assays will be performed at count recovery prior to each 
new cycle of therapy, at 8 weeks after the last round of  
consolidation, and if still positive, every 3 months after completi ng 
therapy for up to two years. Additionally, in the case of mother - 
child pairs or sibling pairs that are mismatched in NIMA, this will  
be conducted before first infusion to assess for persistent  
maternal -fetal microchimerism. 
 
6.4.4 Evaluation of immune  function  
We will evaluation immune function based peripheral blood and bone marrow analysis using the following assays:  
1. Cytokines will be measured, particularly levels of IL1, IL1beta, CRP, IL2, IL6, IL8, IL15, IL21, IFN- gamma, TNF -alpha,  TGF- beta 
2. Lymphocyte subsets will be analyzed using flow cytometric 
lymphocyte immunotyping with fluorochrome conjugated monoclonal antibodies to CD3, CD4, CD8, CD11c, CD16, CD19, 
CD25, CD28, CD45RA/RO, CD56, CD57, CD62L, CD107, 
CD123, TCR gamma -delta, FOXP3, HLA, and KIR 
3. Quantification of recent thymic immigrants will be determined by the presence of TCR rearrangement excision circles (TREC), 
retrospectively performed by real- time quantitative -PCR of DNA 
collected from an isolated fraction of CD31 T cells and next 
Protocol Version: 7/10/2017  
Page 18  of 42  Chemo with Adoptive Haplo DLI   
  
 
generation sequencing to analyze diversity in the TCR repertoires 
produced by the rearrangements of the variable region genes.  
4. NK activity will be assessed by FACS  (CD56+CD107+).  
These assays will be done at count recovery prior to each new  
cycle of therapy, at 8 weeks after the last round of consolidation,  
and every 3 months after completing therapy for up to two years.  
Additional blood will not be drawn for this testing.  
 
6.4.5 T cell receptor  sequencing  
T-cell recovery and repertoire diversity will also be analyzed using 
next-generation DNA sequencing of the complementarity 
determining region 3 (CDR3) of T -cell receptor (TCR) beta chains 
using the Illumina platform. The effectiveness of deep sequencing has been reported by van Heijst et al., who successfully used 5’ 
RACE and deep sequencing to analyze TCR diversity after alloHSCT, demonstrating that this is strategy is feasible and that 
results are reproducible[38 ]. Intriguingly, in their study, van Heijst 
et al. were able to identify a clonal population of T cells associated with EBV relapse, suggesting that TCR deep sequencing may 
provide insight into ongoing anti -infectious and anti -tumor 
immunity. We have conducted our own pilot studies of TCR sequencing through our Immune Core, lead by our collaborator, H. Kim Lyerly, M.D., using frozen tumor biopsies from the Duke 
Breast SPORE tissue b ank, demonstrating our ability to apply this 
technology as well evidence of oligoclonality and antigen -specific 
immune responses in cancer.  
 
Working with Dr. Lyerly and other collaborators, we will use deep 
sequencing of TCR genes to analyze T cell recover y and TCR 
repertoire after chemotherapy and infusion of HLA -haploidentical 
donor lymphocytes. Starting with 5’ RACE, which allows for the 
linear, unbiased and comprehensive amplification of all TCRs 
irrespective of the TCR beta variable (TRBV) or joining ( TRBV) 
gene usage, or other primer -based methods (e.g. Adaptive), we 
will then use real -time PCR to add sequences that incorporate 
barcodes and Illumina flow cell- binding sequences while 
restricting amplification to the linear phase. After cluster 
generation by bridge PCR, 200bp paired- end sequencing 
reactions are then performed using MiSeq and HiSeq2000 sequencers. TRBV, TRBJ and TRBV -TRBJ usage frequencies are 
initially determined as well as repertoire diversity using Shannon 
entropy and Simpson's diversity index as well as non- parametric 
methods, such as abundance- coverage and incidence- coverage. 
Comparisons of individual sequences and their frequencies may 
be made within and between T cell populations and depicted 
graphically as pie charts or overlapping sets, with statistical 
calculations of repertoire relationships made using JMP Software, SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC. As each sequence is defined 
individually, any subtle differences in repertoire may be reported.  
Protocol Version: 7/10/2017  
Page 19  of 42  Chemo with Adoptive Haplo DLI   
  
 
Importantly, CDR3  motifs may be revealed not only at the level of 
amino acid sequence but also in terms of the biochemical and 
biophysical properties of the amino acids therein. Taken together, these attributes will be used to examine the clonotypic 
composition of the naïve and memory CD4 and CD8 T cell pools 
to determine particular TCR signatures.  
 
TCR sequencing will be performed prior to starting treatment, at  
count recovery after induction and before consolidation, at 8  
weeks after the last round of consolidation, and at 1 year after  
therapy. Additional blood will not be drawn for this testing.  
 
6.4.6 Cytokine Release  Syndrome  
We will measure cytokine release with DLI based on peripheral blood analysis. Blood will be taken on the day of cell infusion for 
both induction and consolidation 2, to be drawn before infusion 
and 2 days after infusion for both induction and consolidation 2 to 
evaluate for cytokine release syndrome with DLI, For subjects 
who do not receive their DLI during induction but rather following 
consolidation #1 and consolidation #2, blood will be drawn before 
infusion and 2 days after infusion to measure cytokine release.  
We will use about 4 -8 teaspoons of blood drawn from a vein by a 
needle- stick or through a central line each time you have these 
blood tests.  
 
6.4.7 Geriatric  evaluation  
Comprehensive geriatric assessment:  Patients will be required to 
complete the CGA before induction and 8 weeks after the final 
round of cellular therapy. We have demonstrated previously that inpatient geriatric assessment and management has positively 
affected quality of life in the elderly cancer inpatient at no greater 
length of h ospitalization or extra cost than usual care[
39]. The 
CGA has been validated in CALGB studies in elderly patients with solid tumors (breast, colon, prostate cancers )[40]. The mean time 
to complete the assessment is 23 minutes. Most patients can 
complete the self -administered portion of the assessment without 
assistance, and there is no association between age or educational level and the ability to complete the assessment 
without assistance. Patients may require assistance from the research team for three items: 1) Blessed Orientation- Memory - 
Concentration (BOMC) test; 2) Timed Up and Go; and 3) Karnofsky performance status (KPS). The remainder of the CGA 
is either self -administered or administered by a research assistant 
if the patient requires assistance. The following domains of CGA will be measured: a) Functional Status: Ac tivities of Daily Living, 
Instrumental Activities of Daily Living, Karnofsky Performance 
Rating Scale, Timed Up & Go, Number of Falls in Last 6 Months  
b) Comorbidity: Physical Health Section c) Cognition: Blessed 
Orientation- Memory -Concentration Test d) Psychological: Hospital  
Protocol Version: 7/10/2017

Anxiety and Depression Scale e) Social Functioning: MOS Social 
Activity Limitations Measure f) Social Support: MOS Social 
Support Survey: Emotional and Tangible Subscales, Seeman and Berkman Social Ties, and g) Nutrition: Body Mass Index, % 
Unintentional Weight Loss in the Last 6 Months.  
 
Biologic Markers:  Serum concentrations of the candidate 
cytokines (IL -6, IL-1, IL-2, TNF -α, and CRP) will be determined 
using Luminex MAP, which facilitates the simultaneous evaluation of multiple immune mediators with advantages of higher 
throughput, smaller sample volume, and lower cost, when 
compared to ELISA. All testing will be done in tri plicates using the 
human 29 -plex LINCO assay. For RNA extraction, total cellular 
RNA will be extracted from the leukemic cells using a commercial RNA purification kit; RNA quality will be determined with an 
A260/A280 ratio and capillary electrophoresis on an Agilent 2100 
Bioanalyzer automated analysis system. For DNA microarray analysis, biotinylated cRNA synthesis will be generated with 10 
micrograms of total cellular RNA. RNA will be analyzed on the 
Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer and then hybridized onto a U133A 
oligonucleotide array, and thus will be stained, and washed 
according to an Affymetrix protocol. DNA chips are scanned with the Affymetrix GeneChip scanner, and the signals are processed 
to evaluate the standard RNA measures of expression. Of note, 
each gene on this chip is represented by 10 to 20 
oligonucleotides, termed a “probe set.” The intensity of hybridization of labeled messenger RNA (mRNA) to these sets 
reflects the level of expression of a particular gene. Samples will 
be collected before induction, after induction and before consolidation, and at 8 weeks after completing final round of 
cellular therapy.  
 
Samples will be collected before start of induction and at count 
recovery prior to consolidation 1.

8.0 SUBJECT  REGISTRATION  
 
All subjects who meet eligibility criteria for this study and sign a consent form must be 
registered into Velos eResearch within 24 hours of consent by a member of the Division 
of Hematologic Malignancies and Cellular Therapy team. We also request an email  to 
the study chair, Dr. Anthony Sung, atanthony.sung@duke.edu. The eligibility checklist 
must be completed and the IRB approved consent form signed before any protocol therapy may be started on the patient or donor. 
 
9.0 TOXICITY MONITORING AND ADR  REPORTING  
 
The investigator is required by Federal Regulations to report adverse experiences (AEs) that occur through the duration of the study according to the appropriate 
procedures listed below. The investigator is required to notify, Duke University 
Health System (DUHS) Institutional Review Board (IRB) Office, and DUHS 
Comprehensive Cancer Center if an event is serious, unexpected, and related or 
possibly related to the study. All serious adverse events (SAEs) that occur up to 30 
days after the last Donor Lymphocyte Infusion (DLI) will be reported. After 30 days, 
SAEs will be reported if thought related to treatment for the duration of the study.  
 
Definitions: An adverse event  is any new, undesirable medical experience or 
change of an existing condition that occurs during or after treatment, whether or not considered product -related.  
 
A serious adverse event  is any untoward medical occurrence that suggests 
significant hazard or side effects that result in the following: 
• results in  death  
• is life -threatening (places the patient at immediate risk of  death)  
• requires or prolongs in patient  hospitalization  
• is disabling or  incapacitating 
Protocol Version: 7/10/2017  
Page 22  of 42  Chemo with Adoptive Haplo DLI   
  
• is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
Any SAE will be reported to the DUHS IRB within 24 hours.  
 
An unexpected adverse event  is any adverse event, the specificity or severity of 
which is not consistent with the current investigator brochure or consent form. 
 
This study will utilize the NCI Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) 
version 4.0 to determine the severity of the reaction for adverse event reporting. Only 
adverse events meeting criteria Grade 3 or greater will be collected. Laboratory abnormalities will only be captured if considered clinically significant. Any reactions 
that is reportable (serious, unexpected and related/possibly related to the study) 
must be reported using the Duke University Health System (DUHS) Institutional 
Review Boa rd (IRB) Office SAE form. All other side effects and toxicities will be 
recorded in the patient’s research chart or documented on the computer record for 
the patient.  
 
Specific plan in the event of microbial contamination of infused product:  
Product sterility testing will include a STAT gram stain which will have to be negative prior to release for infusion. A 14 day culture will be performed by our microbiology laboratory as per FDA requirements. In addition, per the SOP of sterility testing,  
cultures will be maintained for 5 days in our stem cell laboratory though typically the product is infused fresh the day of collection or the following day. In the event that a 
culture becomes positive, the lab notifies the treating physician immediately who in 
turn notifies the patient and the treating staff. Subjects will be evaluated within the 
same day of notification of a positive culture by the treating team for any infection 
related incidents and treated appropriately. The evaluation will include a minimum of 
physical examination, vital signs and blood culture.  
In the event of this occurrence, this will be considered an SAE and reported in an expedited manner as above for other serious adverse events if there is a change in the health status of the patient or requiring initiation of antimicrobials.  
 
Investigation plan in case of cellular microbial contamination:  
In the event that a product has a positive culture, all reasonable efforts will be undertaken to detect the possible source. For potential donor source, donor notification and return to clinic or primary care physician for examination if there are 
any signs or symptoms of infection will be recommended. Examination of the chain 
of custody log will occur to ensure proper transit of the product and review of the exact procedure with the laboratory technician who performed the cell selection to 
investigate any potential difficulties that arose (tubing malfunction, bag leakage, etc).  
10.0 DATA MANAGEMENT AND DATA SAFETY  MONITORING  
 
10.1 Data  Management

• Data clarification and/or  resolution 
• Accounting, reconciliation, and destruction/return of used and 
unused study  drugs  
• Review of site study records for  completeness  
• Shipment of all remaining laboratory samples to the designated 
laboratories  
 
 
10.2 Data Safety  Monitoring  
The DCI Monitoring Team will conduct monitoring visits to ensure subject s afety 
and to ensure that the protocol is conducted, recorded, and reported in 
accordance with the protocol, standard operating procedures, good clinical 
practice, and applicable regulatory requirements. As specified in the DCI Data 
and Safety Monitoring Plan, the DCI Monitoring Team will conduct routine monitoring after the third subject is enrolled, followed by annual monitoring of 1 - 
3 subjects until the study is closed to enrollment and subjects are no longer receiving study interventions that are more t han minimal risk.  
 
The Safety Oversight Committee (SOC) will perform annual reviews on findings 
from the DCI Monitoring Team visit and additional safety and toxicity data 
submitted by the Principal Investigator.  
 
Additional monitoring may be prompted by findings from monitoring visits, unexpected frequency of serious and/or unexpected toxicities, or other concerns and may be initiated upon request of DUHS and DCI leadership, the CPC, the 
Safety Oversight Committee (SOC), , the Principal Investigator,  the Duke Clinical 
Trials Quality Assurance (CTQA) office or the IRB. All study documents must be made available upon request to the DCI Monitoring Team and other authorized 
regulatory authorities, which may include but is not limited to the National Institute of Health, National Cancer Institute.. Every reasonable effort will be 
made to maintain confidentiality during study monitoring.

11.0 STUDY DESI GN AND  ANALYSIS 
 
11.1 Primary  Objectives:  
10.1.1 Safety: Evaluate the safety of HLA- haploidentical DLI combined 
with conventional induction and consolidation chemotherapy in terms  of 
unacceptable toxicity as defined in section 7.0. 
 
A maximum of 30 subjects will be consented for a maximum of 21 
evaluable subjects accrued to this protocol over a period of 2 years. 
Safety will be evaluated by the number of subjects with unacceptable 
toxicity  as defined by any of the following:  
 
i. Grade III or IV aGVHD of the gut or liver or Grade IV aGVHD of 
the skin lasting > 7  days;  
 
ii. Grade IV CTCAE toxicity attributable to DLI (e.g. infusion reaction, as opposed to Grade IV CTCAE toxicity from chemotherapy) and lasting >7 days  
 
iii. Treatment -related mortality (TRM), keeping in mind that 
anticipated mortality from standard induction chemotherapy in 
the elderly ranges from 11% for subjects 55- 65 years -old with 
ECOG 0 to 50% for subjects older than 75 years with ECOG 2 
[1]. 
 
Simon’s optimal two stage design will be applied. These rules permit the study to be closed early if there is evidence that the true unacceptable 
toxicity rate is > 0.40. The stopping rules in the table below will also allow 
us to test the null hypothesis that the true toxicity  rate is >0.40 against the 
alternative hypothesis that the true toxicity rate is < 0.20. The Type I and 
II error rates for this design are 0.15 and 0.2, respectively. Given that the 
true toxicity rate is 0.40 (0.20), the probability of stopping the trial at Stage 
1 to accept the null hypothesis is 0.7 (0.16). The significance level of this 
design is 0.15 and the power is  0.80.  
 
Stage  Total 
Accrual  Close study/therapy if number of subjects 
with unacceptable toxicity is > 
1 11 4 (45%)  
2 21 7 (33%)  
 
Rates of unacceptable toxicity will be calculated and monitored with the stopping rules in the table above. Toxicity in the other categories will be 
informally monitored and tabulated by Type and Grade, but they will not 
be used to determine tolerability of the procedure.  
Protocol Version: 7/10/2017  
Page 25  of 42  Chemo with Adoptive Haplo DLI   
  
 
For purposes of toxicity monitoring, each patient will be followed for 
unacceptable toxicity until a toxic event occurs or until 8 weeks after last 
cell infusion, whichever comes first. Accrual will not be suspended while 
collecting data for the interim analyses. However, as soon as a boundary 
within a stage in the table above is crossed, the study will be closed to 
further accrual. This design and the above boundaries will constitute our 
stopping rules for safety.  
 
11.1.2 Efficacy: Evaluate the efficacy of HLA -haploidentical DLI infusion 
combined with conventional induction and consolidation chemotherapy  in 
terms of donor -recipient chimerism and microchimerism.  
 
The assessment of efficacy will be conducted after collecting data for a maximum of 21 evaluable subjects. Our primary efficacy endpoint is the 
1-year DFS rate following adoptive transfer. Using the chi- square test, we 
will test the null hypothesis is the CR rate will be ≤0.20 against the true 
hypothesis that 1-year DFS rate is >0.45. With 21 patients, we can test 
this with approximately 84% power with one- sided alpha level of 0.05.  
Additional efficacy endpoints include the CR rate, overall response rate (CR + partial response), OS, and count recovery. CR and overall 
response rates will be calculated with one- sided 90% confidence interval. 
DFS and OS will be estimated using the method of Kaplan and Meier. All 
statistical analyses will be conducted in conjunction with our co - 
investigator, Zhiguo Li, Ph.D., Assistant Professor of Biostatistics and Bioinformatics.  
 
11.1.3 Geriatric assessment: Medians and frequencies will be used to 
describe the baseline characteristics of participants and performance on 
the CGA. Overall survival and associated 95% CI will be estimated as in 
Aim 1 and correlated with CGA measures. Cox proportional hazards 
models will be fit for each CGA measure as a predictor of OS, in 
unadjusted models and models controlling for age, gender, and ECOG score. We also will estimate the hazard ratios in adjusted Cox regression 
models for continuous variables. To assess the incremental impact of cognitive and physical function variables on predicting survival, we will 
use Integrated Discrimination Improvement as described for survival 
analysis by Chambless et al. [41] and implemented in the 
RiskPredictionParams SAS Macro (macro version 8, Chapel Hill, NC). 
The variables included in the model will be those associated with survival 
in our analysis and included in Kantarjian’s predictive model for early mortality[ 42]. Internal cross -validation of the model will be assessed using 
1000 bootstrap replicates implemented in the RiskPredictionParams SAS macro. Logistic regression analysis will be used to investigate 
relationships between baseline CGA and exploratory outcomes of 30 -day 
mortality and CR. Competing risk modeling will be used to investigate a 
differential effect of impairment in CGA measures by cause of  death[43 ]. 
 
For correlative studies, probe ID’s on Affymetrix U133A gene chip have been identified for the candidate cytokines and include: IL -6 (211000,  
Protocol Version: 7/10/2017  
Page 26  of 42  Chemo with Adoptive Haplo DLI   
  
 
2055207, 204864, 204863, 205945, 212196), IL -1 (39402, 205067,  
10118, 208200, 201404, 216245), IL -2 (207849, 204116), TNF-α 
(211841, 211282, 210405, 211495, 211153, 207643, 207849), and CRP  
(207849, 204116). The mean value for each cytokine from the Luminex 
assay will allow us to identify patients with high or low levels of each cytokine, and relate them to genetic typologies. Correlations between the 
serum cytokine levels and mRNA gene expression level for the cytokines will be evaluated by Spearman correlation. Specifically, the range of 
genes will be related to the panel of cytokines. Statistical significance will 
be assessed  controlling for Type- I error using Hochberg tests, which are 
less conservative relative to the more common Bonferroni corrections [44, 
45]. In order to reduce the dimensionality of the problem further, in follow - 
up tests, we will assess if factorization of the cytokines is feasible (using 
Principal Components Analysis (PCA)), and, if so, the resulting 
components will be related to the genetic typologies. We note that skew 
will likely be present in the cytokine panel which can impact the 
factorization above. We will assess skew, and, if necessary, transform  the 
variables individually to bring about approximate normality All analyses will be conducted at a two- sided a- level of 0.05 using SAS statistical 
software, version 9.2 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). We will use 
Spearman’s correlation to assess the relationship between the biologic 
markers (serum cytokines and gene expression values) and clinical markers (each domain on the CGA and ECOG PS). While this work is 
exploratory and it could be argued that there is no need to adjust for 
multiple testing we will adjust p- values by  the Hochberg method to control 
the Type- I error rate inherent in multiple testing[ 46]. All statistical 
analyses will be conducted in conjunction with our co -invest igator, Zhiguo 
Li, Ph.D.  
 
11.2 Secondary  Objectives:  
 
11.2.1 Evaluate incidence and severity of acute GVHD.  
 
In addition to monitoring the rate of grade III -IV aGVHD of the gut 
or liver and grade IV aGVHD of the skin as in 10.1.1, we will also 
monitor overall rates of GVHD. Rates will be calculated with one 
sided 85% confidence interval.  
 
11.2.2 Evaluate incidence and severity of other adverse events.  
 
We will monitor other adverse events as defined in sections 7.0 
and 9.0. Rates will be calculated with one sided 85% confidence 
interval.  
 
11.2.3 Evaluate efficacy with respect to disease response and survival.  
 
Additional efficacy endpoints include response rate, DFS, EFS, 
and OS. The response rate will be calculated with one sided 85%  
Protocol Version: 7/10/2017  
Page 27  of 42  Chemo with Adoptive Haplo DLI   
  
 
confidence interval. DFS, EFS, and OS will be estimated using the 
method of Kaplan and Meier.  
 
11.2.4 Evaluate immune recovery.  
 
Immune reconstitution results will be tabulated and recorded. For 
the evaluation of recovery of immune function post -engraftment, we 
will use descriptive statistics of cytokine profiles, lymphocyte and NK enumeration and flow -based assays and make patient -specific 
plots of immune function parameters across time. These measurements will be performed prior to induction, prior to each round of consolidation, 8 weeks after the last cycle of consolidation, 
and every 3 months after treatment for up to 2 years. Specifically, 
we will:  
1. monitor leukocyte subsets using flow  cytometry:  
· CD3+  
· CD4+  
· CD8+  
· regulatory (CD4+, CD25+,  CD62L+)  
· cytotoxic/late memory (CD8+, CD57+, CD28 -) and  activated 
(CD8+, HLADR+) T  cells 
· naïve CD4+ T cells with L -selectin expression (CD4+, 
CD45RA+/CD45RO -, CD62L+)  
· gamma -delta T  cells 
· B cells (CD19+, CD3 -, CD16 -, CD56 -) 
· natural killer cells (NK) (CD3 -, CD16+/CD56+,  CD107+)  
· natural killer T cells (NKT) (CD3+,  CD16+/CD56+, 
CD107+),  
· plasmacytoid dendritic cells (DCs) (CD123+,  CD11c -) 
· myeloid DCs (CD123 -, CD11c+)  
 
2. quantifiy recent thymic immigrants by the presence of TCR 
rearrangement excision circles (TREC) performed by real -time 
quantitative- PCR of DNA collected from an isolated  fraction of 
CD31 T  cells 
 
3. perform next generation sequencing of TCR gene 
rearrangements to analyze diversity in the TCR repertoires produced by the rearrangements of the variable region  genes.  
 
4. in vitro assays of NK function (measure CD16 expression, 
intracellular CD107a degranulation and cytokine secretions of 
IFNy and TNFa after 4 hour co -culture with an effector:target ratio 
of 2:1) 
 
5. measure immunoglobulin levels as a function of B -cell activity 
and recovery  
Protocol Version: 7/10/2017  
Page 28  of 42  Chemo with Adoptive Haplo DLI   
  
 
6. measure cytokine levels, particularly IL1, IL1- beta, IL2, IL6, IL8, 
IL15, IL21, IFN -gamma, TNF -alpha, TGF- beta,  CRP 
 
7. microchimerism monitoring to determine the level of donor cells 
(as well as the presence of any pre -existing maternal -fetal 
microchimeri sm) 
 
8. KIR typing to determine the effect of KIR ligand mismatch 
 
9. PD1/PDL1/PDL2 expression (marker of T cell  exhaustion)  
 
 
11.2.5 Evaluate hematopoietic recovery.  
 
Time to neutrophil and platelet recovery will be reported using 
descriptive statistics. Time to neutrophil recovery is defined 
according to the Center for International Blood and Marrow 
Transplant Research (CIBMTR) reporting guidelines. This is defined as the date of the first of three consecutive laboratory 
values where the ANC ≥ 500/μl. If daily laboratory values were 
not obtained, ANC recovery is defined as three consecutive laboratory values drawn more than a day apart as long as the 
ANC remains ≥ 500/μ l. The CIBMTR defines the time to platelet 
recovery as the date of the first of three consecutive laboratory values obtained on different days where the platelet count was > 20,000/μl without transfusion.  
 
11.3 Subgroup analysis:  
Subgroup analysis will be conducted based on age (55 -70 vs >70), sex, WHO 
classification, relationship between donor and recipient, pre -existing maternal - 
fetal microchimerism in mother -child pairs, presence of pos t-infusion donor 
chimerism and microchimerism, HLA mismatch, and KIR- ligand mismatch.  
 
12.0 ANTICIPATED TOXICITY OF DLI PROCEDURE  
 
12.1 GVHD 
Although GVHD is a common complication of DLI, given the absence of GVHD in a similar study by Guo et al. [6], we do not anticipate any  GVHD in our study. This 
is because unlike a traditional transplant in which that patient engrafts with donor cells, which then go on to cause GVHD, we do not expect long -term engraftment, 
and therefore donor cells should not persist long enough to cause G VHD. 
 
12.2 Infections  
Although infections are a common complication of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and donor lymphocyte infusion, we do not expect any of the procedures specifically associated with DLI to increase the risk of infection 
beyond that associated with induction and consolidation chemotherapy.  
Protocol Version: 7/10/2017  
Page 29  of 42  Chemo with Adoptive Haplo DLI   
  
 
 
12.3 Infusion Reaction/Engraftment  Syndrome 
Patients may experience reactions to the infusion itself including fever, chills, skin 
rash, pulmonary infiltrates, diarrhea, hepatic dysfunction, renal dysfunction, or 
confusion. Any such reaction would be transient and we would respond by 
slowing the infusion as per 6.3.4. Steroids, tocilizumab, acetaminophen, and 
intravenous fluids may also be administered in the case of such a reaction.  
 
12.4 Risk of  sensitization  
Infusion of haploidentical cells may result in alloimmunization of the donor; i.e., 
sensitization, which may make engraftment after allogeneic hematopoietic stem 
cell transplantation more difficult, if such a therapy were planned later. However, 
as an institution, we have considerable experience overcoming sensitization and 
alloimmunization in the allogeneic transplant situation, and we do not anticipate 
significant problems with engraftment should an allogeneic transplantation be needed in the future.  
13.0 DRUG INFORMATION 
13.1Cytarabine (ara -C) 
13.1.1 Source and Pharmacology: Cytarabine for Injection USP,  commonly  
known as ara- C, an antineoplastic for intravenous, intrathecal, or 
subcutaneous administration, contains sterile lyophilized cytarabine (1- β-D-Arabinofuranosylcytosine). Cytarabine is an odorless, white to off - 
white, crystalline powder which is freely soluble in water and slightly soluble in alcohol and in chloroform . Cytarabine is a synthetic 
nucleoside which differs from the normal nucleosides cytidine and deoxycytidine in that the sugar moiety is arabinose rather than ribose or deoxyribose.  
 
13.1.2 Formulation and Stability: Cytarabine is rapidly metabolized and is  
not effective when taken orally; less than 20% of the orally administered dose is absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Following rapid 
intravenous injection of cytarabine labeled with tritium, the 
disappearance from plasma is biphasic. There is an initial distributive phase with a half -life of about 10 minutes, followed by a second 
elimination phase with a half -life of about 1 to 3 hours. After the 
distributive phase, more than 80% of plasma radioactivity can be 
accounted for by the inactive metabolit e 1-β-D- Arabinofuranosyluracil 
(ara-U). Within 24 hours, about 80% of the administered radioactivity 
can be recovered in the urine, approximately 90% of which is excreted as ara -U. Relatively constant plasma levels can be achieved by 
continuous intravenous  infusion. After subcutaneous or intramuscular 
administration of cytarabine labeled with tritium, peak plasma levels of 
radioactivity are achieved about 20 to 60 minutes after injection and are considerably lower than those after intravenous  administration . 
 
13.1.3 Supplier: Commercial Supply.  
Protocol Version: 7/10/2017  
Page 30  of 42  Chemo with Adoptive Haplo DLI   
  
13.1.4 Toxicity: Because cytarabine is a bone marrow suppressant, anemia , 
leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, megaloblastosis, and reduced 
reticulocytes can be expected as a result of administration of 
cytarabine. The severity of these reactions are dose and schedule 
dependent. Cellular changes in the morphology of bone marrow and 
peripheral smears can be expected. Following 5- day constant infusions 
or acute injections of 50 to 600 mg/m2, white cell depression follows a 
biphasic course. Regardless of initial count, dosage level, or schedule, 
there is an initial fall starting the first 24 hours with a nadir at days 7  to 
9. Viral, bacterial , fungal , parasitic , or saprophytic infections, in any 
locati on in the body may be associated with the use of cytarabine alone 
or in combination with other immunosuppressive agents following  
immunosuppressant doses that affect cellular or humoral immunity. 
These infections may be mild, but can be severe and at times fatal.  
 
13.1.5 Route of Administration: IV over 5 to 7  days.  
 
 
13.2 Idarubicin  
13.2.1 Source and Pharmacology: Idarubicin HCl Injection contains 
idarubicin hydrochloride and is a sterile, semi -synthetic, preservative- 
free solution antineoplasticanthracycline for intravenous  use. 
 
Idarubicin HCl is a DNA -intercalating analog of daunorubicin which has 
an inhibitory effect on nucleic acid synthesis and interacts with the 
enzyme topoisomerase II. The absence of a methoxy group at position 
4 of the anthracycline structure gives the compound a high lipophilicity which results in an increased rate of cellular uptake compared with 
other anthracyclines.  
 
 
13.2.2 Formulation and Stability: Idarubicin HCl Injection is a sterile, red - 
orange, isotonic parenteral preservative- free solution, available in 5 mL 
(5 mg), 10 mL (10mg) and 20 mL (20 mg) single- use-only vials. Each 
mL contains idarubicin HCI 1 mg and the following inactive ingredients: 
glycerin 25 mg and water for injection q.s. Hydrochloric acid is used to 
adjust the pH to a target of  3.5. 
Pharmacokinetic studies have been performed in adult leukemia 
patients with normal renal and hepatic function following intravenous 
administration of 10 to 12 mg/m2 of idarubicin daily for 3 to 4 days as a single agent or combined with cytarabine. The plas ma concentrations of 
idarubicin are best described by a two or three compartment open model. The elimination rate of idarubicin from plasma is slow with an 
estimated mean terminal half -life of 22 hours (range, 4 to 48 hours) 
when used as a single agent and  20 hours (range, 7 to 38 hours) when 
used in combination with cytarabine. The elimination of the primary active metabolite, idarubicinol, is considerably slower than that of the 
parent drug with an estimated mean terminal half -life that exceeds 45  
Protocol Version: 7/10/2017  
Page 31  of 42  Chemo with Adoptive Haplo DLI   
  
 
hours; hence, its plasma levels are sustained for a period greater than 8 
days.  
 
13.2.3 Supplier: Commercial Supply.  
13.2.4 Toxicity: Idarubicin is intended for administration under the 
supervision of a physician who is  experienced in leukemia 
chemotherapy. Idarubicin is a potent bone marrow  suppressant. 
Idarubicin should not be given to patients with pre- existing bone 
marrow suppression induced by previous drug therapy or 
radiotherapy unless the benefit warrants the risk. 
 
Severe myelosuppression will occur in all patients given a therapeutic dose of this agent for induction, consolidation or maintenance. Careful hematologic monitoring is required. Deaths due to infection and/or bleeding have been reported during the period of severe myelosuppression. Facilities with laboratory and 
supportive resources adequate to monitor drug tolerability and protect and maintain a patient compromised by drug toxicity should be available. It must be possible to treat rapidly and completely a severe hemorrhagic condition and/or a severe infection.  
 
Pre-existing heart disease and previous therapy with anthracyclines 
at high cumulative doses or other potentially cardiotoxic agents are co-factors for increased risk of idarubicin- induced cardi ac toxicity 
and the benefit to risk ratio of idarubicin therapy in such patients should be weighed before starting treatment with idarubicin.  
Myocardial toxicity as manifested by potentially fatal congestive heart failure, acute life- threatening arrhythmias or other 
cardiomyopathies may occur following therapy with idarubicin. Appropriate therapeutic measures for the management of congestive heart failure and/or arrhythmias are indicated.  
 
Cardiac function should be carefully monitored during treatment in order to minimize the risk of cardiac toxicity of the type described 
for other anthracycline compounds. The risk of such myocardial toxicity may be higher following concomitant or previous radiation to the mediastinal -pericardial area or in patients with anemia, bone 
marrow depression, infections, leukemic pericarditis and/or myocarditis. While there are no reliable means for predicting congestive heart failure, cardiomyopathy induced by anthracyclines is usually associated with a decrease of the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) from pretreatment baseline values. Since hepatic and/or renal function impairment can affect the disposition of idarubicin, liver and kidney function should be evaluated  with 
Protocol Version: 7/10/2017  
Page 32  of 42  Chemo with Adoptive Haplo DLI   
  
conventional clinical laboratory tests (using serum bilirubin and 
serum creatinine as indicators) prior to and during treatment. In a number of Phase III clinical trials, treatment was not given if bilirubin and/or creatinine serum levels exceeded 2 mg%.  However, 
in one Phase III trial, patients with bilirubin levels between 2.6 and 5 mg% received the anthracycline with a 50% reduction in dose.  
Dose reduction of idarubicin should be considered if the bilirubin and/or creatinine levels are above the normal range.

1 Tests at entry are recommended to be done within 1 week before initiating therapy; however if there are no sig. change in patient’s status and tests are less than 
4 weeks old then they are acceptable; exceptions include bone marrow aspirate and biopsy and cardiopulmonary testing (acceptable if within 8 weeks)  
2 Therapy and recovery refer to the period while the patient is receiving induction (IND1 or IND2) or consolidation chemotherapy until count recovery and discharge  
3 For cardiopulmonary testing, refer to section 5.1.  
4If patient already had a bone marrow biopsy and this was not collected, ok to skip  
5 Per investigator discretion  
6 Count Recovery would be considered when the ANC count is >1000/ul  
7 If any subjects do not complete all the therapies (i.e. Induction 1/2, Consolidation 1 and 2), they will be followed for survival, but do not need to complete any 
listed assessments  
8Any leftover cells at q3months after completing therapy will be used to run NK Lysis, TCR sequencing, and PD1/PDL1/PDL2 expression research samples. 
Additional blood will not be drawn for this testing.

The Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment is provided as a separate attachment.  
 
VI. FACT Donor Test Requirements  
 
Testing for the following infectious disease is performed within 30 days of donation for PBSC, Bone Marrow, 
and Directd Granulocyte donation, and within 7 days for DLI, NK Cell donation, on blood samples drawn on 
stem cell or other cellular therapy. Donors  donating over a time period in excess of 30 days will have these 
tests repeated every 30 days (or 7 days if DLI or NK Cell). Unrelated cord blood donors are tested by the cord blood bank at the time of procurement of the cord blood donation. This information is provided to the 
transplant center through the NMDP data systems.  
 
The testing panel for autologous and allogeneic adult donors not on IVIG supplementation (within 6 months) of the donation is listed below.  1. Hepatitis B Surface Antigen (HBsAg)

screening assessment can serve as the Day 1 pre-treatment assessment of Course 1 if performed within 72 hours 
before the first treatment and do esnot need to be repeated   
b Treatment courses: all courses are 4 weeks in duration (28 days). During the treatment period, clinical assessments 
and safety laboratory tests must be performed prior to study drug administration on the visit day. All subseque nt 
visit dates should be calculated based on Course 1 Visit 1 date. One or more visits can be skipped in case of 
treatment interruption. Patients may continue on treatment until the criteria for stopping medication are met (see 
Section 3.3.4 ). 
c EOT: if the decision to permanently discontinue afatinib treatment is taken during a scheduled visit, the End Of 
Treatment (EOT) visit should be performed instead of the scheduled visit ( or within 7 calendar days after last drug 
administ ration)
d FU: all patients should have a follow -up (FU) visit 28+7 days after the permanent discontinuation of afatinib
e Written informed consent must be obtained before any protocol sp ecific screening assessment is p erformed
f A 12 -lead resting digital electrocardiogram (ECG) wil l be performed at Screening and reviewed by the 
investigator. Refer to Section 5.2.4 for details
g Physical exam: includes a thorough cardiopulmonary, abdominal and regional lymph node exam and an 
assessment of the mental and neurological status. No need to repeat the physical exam on C1V1D1 if within three 
calendar days of the screening physical exam and the patient is deemed stable by the investigator
h Vital signs: includes respiratory rate, pulse, temperature and blood pressure
i Safety lab :CBC: include white blood cell count, neutrophil and bands, differential, hemoglobin, hematocrit and 
platelet count. Serum chemistries: include sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, BUN, creatinine, g lucose, 
AST, ALT, GGT, total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, calcium, magnesium. See Section 5.2.3
j Additional labo ratory assessments should be performed if clinically indicated 
k Urine analysis: include pH, protein, glucose, ketones, blood, leucocytes, nitrite, bilirubin, urobilinogen, and 
specific gravity .  In case of pathological finding, further evaluation should be performed and results documented in

1.1 MEDICAL BACKGROUND
Non-Small Cell L ung Cancer (NSCL C) is the leading cause of cancer- related deaths in man y 
countries, including the US. The prognosis for advanced stage disease has improved modestly  
in the past 20 y ears. With an overall 5- year survival rate of onl y 15% the treatment of this 
disease clearl y remains a major clinical challenge ( R05-0867).
While sy stem ic chemotherapy  has demonstrated modest activity in advanced NSCL C, novel 
targeted therapies based on specific molecular and biological characteristics of lung cancer 
have emerged as a new treatment paradigm. Among the molecules most extensively studied 
are the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptors (EGFR) or the Subclass I of the superfamily  of 
transmembrane t yrosine kinase receptors ( R06-1301 , R06 - 1302 ).
Aberrant activation of EGFR frequentl y observed i n a variet y of malignant tumors can be 
induced b y different molecular mechanisms including receptor overexpression, mutation, 
ligand -dependent receptor dimerization, and ligand -independent activation. Overexpression 
of EGFR has been detected in 40% to 80% of NSCL C patients ( R06-1301, R06- 1393 , R06-
1394 ). However, recent clinical experiences with specific EGFR- Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors 
(TKI) have demonstrated tumor regres sion in only 10% to 15% of unselected NSCL C 
patients ( R05-0867, R06 - 1301 , R06-1306 ). The treatment with EGFR TKIs isassociated with
higher Response R ate (RR) in patients with tumors which harbor EGFR mutations.  In a 
recent meta -analy sis based on 13 randomized trials, the response rate was 70% vs. 33.2% in 
first-line trials. In three second -line trials, response rates were 47.4% vs. 28.5%, with a 
benefit similar t o first -line trials (R elative Risk, 1.79; p = .04) (R12-4000 ).  Somatic 
mutations between exons 18 through 21 of the EGFR gene was found to occur in 
approximately  10% of NSCL C patients from the US, Europe or Australia compared to up to 
30% in patients from Japan and Taiwan ( R06-1262 , R06-1306 , R06-1393 ).The most 
common EGFR mutations are a short, in- frame deletion in exon 1 9 (E19del [L REA del etion] 
found in approximately  46% of patients) and a point mutation (CTG to CGG) that results in a 
substitution of leucine by arginine at codon 858 of exon 21 ([L 858R] found in 37.5% of 
patients) ( R14-2119).
Two large multinational randomized Phase III studies of afatinib in the f irst line treatment of 
mutation positive stage IVNSCL C patients have been performed :the LUX-Lung 3 (1200.32) 
and LUX -Lung 6 (1200.34) studies . 
LUX -Lung 3compared first line afatinib to up to six cy cles of cisplatin /pemetrexed (N=345 
with 2:1 ra ndomization). Adult p atients with performance status (PS) 0- 1 were included in 
the trial without age limitation .Seventy -two percent ( 72%) of all trial patients were Asian 
with the rem ainder classified as non- Asian. In this trial patients treated with afatinib 
demonstrated significant and clinically  meaningful improvements in progression free survival 
(PFS, median PFS afatinib vs. cisplatin/pemetrexed 11.1 vs. 6.9 months, hazard ratio 0.58; 
95% CI ,0.43 to 0.78; P=.001) and O bjective Response Rate(ORR, afatinib vs cisplatin 
/pemetrexed 56% vs. 23% ;P= .001).  This was accompanied b y significant delay s in time to

0.93; P = .01) . A pre -planned anal ysis of PFS in patients (n=308) with exon del 19 or L858R 
mutation was 13.6 months for afatinib and 6.9 months for chemotherap y (HR 0.47; 95% CI : 
0.34 to 0.65; P=0.001). Higher response rates were observed in afatinib groups compared 
with chemotherap y 69% and 44%, respectivel y (P13-07382 ).
LUX -Lung 6compared first line afatin ibto up to six cy cles of cisplatin/gemcitabine (N=364 
with 2:1 randomization afatinib: cisplatin/gemcitabine ).All patients were Asian. As in LUX -
Lung 3, patients with performance status 0- 1 were included in the trial without age limitation . 
Patients treate d with afatinib demonstrated significant improvements in progression f ree 
survival (median PFS afatinib vs. cisplatin/gemcitabine 11.0 mont hs vs . 5.6 months, hazard 
ratio 0.28; 95% CI  0.20 t o 0.39; P<0.0001) and ORR (afatinib vs. cisplatin/gemcitabine 
66.9% vs. 23.0 %, P <0. 0001).  This was accompanied by  significant delay s in time to 
deterioration of the cancer-related s ymptoms of cough (afatinib vs.cisplatin/gemcitabine HR
0.45, 95% CI , 0.30 to 0.68 ; P = .0001) and d yspnea (HR 0.54; 95% CI, 0.40 to 0.7 3; P< 
0.0001) [P14- 00758 ]
In a separate single arm study  (LUX -Lung 2) [ P12-03681] in lung adenocarcinoma patients 
(stage IIIb with pleural effusion or stage IV) with EGFR mutations, 129 patients were treated 
in first-line or second -line with afatinib, 99 with a starting dose of 50 mg and 30 with a 
starting dose of 40 mg. 79 (61%) of 129 patients had an objective response (two complete 
responses, 77 partial responses). 70 (66%) of the 106 patients with the two most common 
activating EGFR mutations ( deletion 19 or L858R ) had an objective response, as did nine 
(39%) of 23 patients with less common mutations.
For patients previously  treated with a reversible EGFR TKI and clinicall y enriched for EGFR 
mutations, treatment with afatinib plus best supportive care resulted in a significant 
improvement in median PFS over patients treated with a placebo plus best supp ortive care 
(LUX- Lung 1/1200.23) [ U10-3048-01].This improvement in PFS was accompanied by  
significant and meaningful improvements in cough, dyspnoea, and pain, compared to the 
placebo group. Treatment with afatinib was also f ound to significantl y delay the time to 
deteriorat ion for Global Health S tatus/Quality  of Life (QoL) . 
A subsequent and larger study  (LUX -Lung 5/1200.42) enrolling a similar population of 
patients resulted in a very  similar median PFS as in L UX-Lung 1 . In these studies, the PFS 
benefit of afatinib was consistent across all pre -planned subgroups with at least 50 patients, 
including gender, age, race, baseline Eastern Cooperative Oncology  Group (ECOG) 
performance status, t ype of prior EGFR TKI, baseline tumor size, and lines of prior 
chemotherap y. In both of these studies (LUX- Lung 1and 5) treatment with afatinib had the 
greatest PFS benefit for those patients who belonged to a subgroup highly  clinically  enriched 
for EGFR mutations or who were positive for E GFR mutations by  testing of tumor tissue.

four human cell- lines known to co -express E rbB receptors. 
For the latest information on the drug profile of afatinib, please refer to the current afatinib 
Investigator Brochure (IB) (c01802941-09).  All references in this protocol concerning 
afatinib refer to the free base compound afatinib which is used as the oral formulation.
Afatinib is moderatel y fast absorbed after oral administration. Maximum plasma 
concentrations of afatinib were achieved mainly at 2 to 5 hours after oral drug administration. 
Afatinib maximum plasma concentrations and area under the curve increased slightly  over -
proportional with increasing doses in the therapeutic range of 20 - 50mg . Moderate to high 
inter-and intra -individual differences in plasma 
concentration were seen. Afatinib is highl y 
distributed out of the blood and has a moderate to high clearance. The ove rall gMean terminal 
half-life at steady  state was 37.2 hours in cancer patients. Steady  state was reached no later 
than 8 day s after the first administration. The major route of elimination of afatinib was via 
faeces. After food intake, a decreased systemi c exposure was observed compared to 
administration under fasted conditions. Therefore, afatinib should be taken without food (i.e. 
food should not be consumed for at least 
2hours before and at least 1 hour after taking 
afatinib). The PK characteristics in Caucasian cancer patients were comparable to those 
observed in Japanese cancer patients. 
Afatinib is bound covalently  to proteins to a variable extent and covalent protein adducts 
were the major circulating metabolites in the plasma. Afatinib did not sho w relevant 
inhibition or induction of cy tochrome P450 isoenzy mes, and it appears unlikely  that drug -
drug interactions based on this mechanism will occur. 
Afatinib is a substrate of the P -gp transporter. Concomitant administration of the potent P- gp
inhibi tor ritonavir did not relevantl y change the exposure to 40 mg afatinib when taken
simultaneously  with or 6 h after afatinib but increased the bioavailability  of afatinib (single
dose of 20 mg) b y 48% and 39% for AUC0- ∞ and Cmax when given 1 h before afatin ib,
respectivel y. Pretreatment with the potent P -gp inducer rifampicin decreased the plasma
exposure of 40 mg afatinib by  34 % afatinib (AUC0- ∞) and 22 % (Cmax), respectivel y.
Caution should be exercised when combining afatinib with potent P -gp modulators .
In pre -clinical studies afatinib is not an irritant to intact skin but an ocular irritant.

This document may not -in full or in part -be passed on, reproduced, published or otherwise used without prior written permission.Two phase I open label dose-escalation studies determined the Maximum Tolerated Dose 
(MTD) with continuous dosing of afatinib in patients with advanced solid tumours at 40mg 
and 50mg daily , respec tively (U07-3128-02, U08- 1023 -02). Adverse events (AE) observed 
with afatinib are consistent with those reported for other EGFR and dual EGFR/HER2 
inhibitors. The most frequent investigator defined drug-related AEs were associated with 
gastrointestinal disorders ( including diarrhoea, and stomatitis), skin and subcutaneous tissue 
disorders (rash, dry  skin, pruritus, acneiform rash, ac ne), nail effects, epistaxis, fatigue, and 
decreased appetite . Earl y and proactive management of diarrhoea , mucositis/stomatitis and 
skin rash together with t
reatment interruptions and dose reductions is recommended in line 
with recent guidelines in the management of common toxicities of EGFR and EGFR/HER2 
TKIs and monoclonal antibodies ( R07-4077, P07 - 11507, R07 - 4078 ).

ASSESSMENT
2.1 RATIONALE FOR PERFORMING THE T RIAL
The US registration of the EGFR TKIs afatinib and erlotinib has changed the clini cal 
management of patients with advanced NSCLC (R06-1394, R06 - 1307 , R07-1049 , R07-
1134 ). A significant clinical benefit may  be achieved by  a treatment that co ntrols NSCL C 
progression with acceptable levels of side effects through a defined and specific targeted 
molecular mechanism.
Elderly  patients (variously  defined in the literature as≥ 65years of age or >70 yearsof age)
tend to be under represented in clin ical trials (R14-1781, R14 - 1839 , R14-1840 ).For this trial 
we will define elderly patients as those patients who are 70 years of age or older. 
Half of all NSCL C patients are 70 y ears of age or older at the time of initial diagnosis ( R14-
1781 ).
There are several retrospective subset analyses from large clinical trials of the saf ety and 
efficacy  of EGFR TKI s in elderl y patients (age> 70). These trials were conducted regard less 
ofmutational status and allowed multiple prior lines of therap y (R09-2250 ,R14-1350 ). One 
such study  in Canadian patients demonstra ted significant improvement in progression free 
survival in both elderly  and y ounger populations compa red to placebo ( R09-2250). Elderl y 
patients however ,had significantly  more overall and severe toxicity  (grade 3/4 35% vs. 
18.5%; p< .001) .  The elderly  werealsomore likely  to have > grade 3 rash, fatigue, 
stomatitis, or dehy
dration.  
A subset anal ysis of a Japanese population based observational study  in  patients ≥75 years of 
agetreated with the same EGFR TKI as in the Canadian study  was performed. Patients 
received treatment without regard to mutational status and had multiple prior lines of therap y.
In this stud y there was a statistical difference between the disease control rate in the elderly
and non- elderly (58.2 % vs .42.5 % P= 0.0228). There was no statistical difference in the 
time to treatment failure or in overall survival between the two groups. There was also no 
significant difference in the occurrence of grade > 3 toxicities between the groups. [R15-
0770 ]  
Afatinib is approved in the United S tates for the first line treatment of patients with Exon 19 
Deletions or Exon 21(L 858R) substitution mutations based on the results of the LUX-Lung 3 
clinical trial .In that first line trial, encompassing 345 patients wi th varying EGFR mutations, 
themean age was60.3 years; 230 patients were randomized to Afatinib, from which 48 
patients were 70 years of age.  Of these patients, 41 had exon 19 deletions or L858R 
mutations.
This trial is proposed to obtain additional inf ormation about the tolerability of treatment with 
first line afatinib in the US elderly  population by  evaluating the proportion of patients with 
AEs leading to dose reduction of afatinib.   It is felt that the use of the 30 mg dose of 
afatinib in this vuln erable patient population (patients with ECOG PS of 2 or 3) reflects 
actual clinical practice.

The objective of this study  is to describe the occurrence of AEs leading to dose reduction 
following afatinib treatment in NSCL C patients with common EGFR mutation s (Deletion 19
and/or L858R ) who are 70 y ears of age or older. 
See Section 5 for a detailed description of the study  endpoints.
2.3 BENEFIT - RISK ASSESSMENT
Despite recent advances, NSCL C still has a dismal prognosis with an overall 5 y ear survival 
rate of 15%. 
  Afatinib is approved in the United S tates for the first line treatment of patients 
with Exon 19 Deletions or Exon 21(L 858R) substitution mutations . I
ntheLUX -Lung 3 trial, 
afatinib showed a statistically  significant and clinically  meaningful improvement in PFS, 
response rate and lung cancer symptoms compared to chemotherap yin NSCL C patients with 
common EGFR mutation (P13-07382). Across all afatinib clinical trials, diarrhoea , including 
severe diarrhoea, has been reporte d during treatment .Diarrhoea may  result in dehy dration 
with or without renal impairment, which in rare cases has resulted in fatal outcomes. Diarrhea 
usually  occurred within the firs t 2 weeks of treatment. Grade 3 diarrhea is reported in about 
15% of patients and most frequentl yoccurred within the first 6 weeks of treatment. 
The dermatological AEs in afatinib trials are captured as group terms including rash, acne, 
paron ychia, pruri tus, dry  skin, eczema, and folliculitis. Across all trials rash/acne occurred at 
a high frequency  and half of the cases begin within 4 weeks of exposure to afatinib. Grade 3 
rash wasobserved in about 17- 18% of patients and those at higher risk for Grade 3 rash/acne 
appear to be the patients of low body weight/body surface area and patients with low baseline 
renal function. 
Interstitial lung disease (ILD) is a rare and serious (potentially  fatal) AE reported with other
EGFR TKIs. The frequency  of ILD -like AEs in all afatinib treated patients was low 
(approximately  1%) and similar to that observed with other EGFR TKI s. In this study , 
patients with known pre -existing ILD will be excluded. Afatinib treatment will be interrupted 
if patients experienc eacute onset and/or unexplained worsening of pulmonary  symptoms 
(including d yspnea, cough, and fever). If interstitial lung disease is diagnosed, study  drug 
must be permanentl y discontinued and appropriate treatment should be instituted as 
necessary .
Although rare, a potential for drug -induced liver injury  (DILI ) due to afatinib is under 
constant surveillance b y sponsors and regulators. Therefore, this study  requires timely  
detection, evaluation, and follow -
up of laboratory alterations of selected liver la boratory  
parameters to ensure patient safet y.
Keratitis was identified using the MedDRA SMQ (Medical Dictionary  for Drug Regulatory  
Activities Standardised MedDRA Queries )(narrow) for corneal disorders and B oehringer 
Ingelheim ’s internal database was searched. In all afatinib-treated patients as of 15 January

preferred term being keratitis (19 patients [0.4%]).
In regard to treatment of older pati ents, in the LUX -Lung 3 study , the predominant adverse 
events noted in patients aged 70 and over (N= 48) receiving afatinib treatment were diarrhoea
95.8% (10.4% > grade 3), rash/acne 85.4% (12.5% > grade 3), stomatitis 66.7% (6.3% > 
grade 3) and nail ef fects 56.3% (16.7% > grade 3). These adverse events were treated 
symptomaticall y, and with treatment interruption and dose reductions. For patients aged 70 
and over, therap y was discontinued because of treatment related AEs in 14.6% of the patients 
receiv ing afatinib. Of the most common AEs associated with afatinib, only diarrhoea (4.2%) 
and paron ychia (2.1%) were cause for treatment discontinuation. There were no cases of 
interstitial lung disease -like events potentiall y related to afatinib in patients 70 years of age or 
older. Two deaths in this age group were considered to be related to afatinib treatment (one 
respiratory  decompensation an d one sepsis) . In the first line Lux Lung 6 trial encompassing
364patients with varying EGFR mutations, one hundred percent of patients were Asian .The 
mean age was 56 years, 25 ( 6.9 % ) afatinib patients were 70 y ears of age or older and had 
exon 19 deletions or L 858R mutations. The tolerability  of afatinib in this study  was 
consistent with what was reported in the LUX -Lung 3 trial. .
In this stud y, the guideline for management of expected side effects of afatinib will be 
followed (refer to 
Section 4.4 ). Regular and frequent monitoring of the safety  as well as the 
clinical benefi t throughout the trial will be implemented, including scheduled clinical visits 
when the emergence of afatinib related AEs are expected.  Hence, earl y management and 
education will take place to mitigate worsening of sy mptoms. In addition, periodic tumor 
assessment will be performed by the investigator; patients lacking clinical benefit will be 
removed from afatinib treatment. 
In summary ,there is a medical need for i mproving treatment of elderl y patients with EGFR 
driver mutations.

3.1 OVERALL TRIAL DESIGN AND PLAN
This is an open label , non -randomized, single arm Phase IV study  in patients 70 years of age 
or older with stage IV or recurrent Non
-Small Cell L ung Cancer whose tumors harbor 
common EGFR mutations. A total of approximately  25patients wi ll be entered into the trial.
After completion of the screening assessments, eligible patients will be treated with a starting 
dose of 30mg afatinib daily as monotherapy . The dose may  be reduced dependent on the AE 
profile of the individual patient and concomitant medication. See Section 4.4on afatinib dose 
modification.
The patient participation in the trial is considered to be concluded when the follow -up visit is 
complete. For patients that agree to be followed, vital status will be collected every  3 months 
until the end of the trial.  The end of the trial is defined approximately  one year after the last 
patient has entered the study .

This document may not -in full or in part -be passed on, reproduced, published or otherwise used without prior written permission.Afatinib should be taken at approximately  the same time each day  without food (at least one 
hour before a meal orat least twohours after a meal).  
Missed doses of afatinib can be made up within 12 hours of the scheduled time .  Otherwise, 
the dose must be skipped and patients should take the next scheduled dose at the usual time. 
Patients with emesis must not take a replacement dose.
If dosing of whole tablets is not possible, afatinib tablets can also be dispersed in
approximately  100 ml of non -carbonated drinking water. No other liquids should be used. 
The tablet should be dropped in the water, without crushing it, and occasionally  stirred for up 
to 15 min until the tablet is broken up into very  small particles. The dispersion should be 
drunk immediately . The glass should be rinsed with approximately  100 ml of water which 
should also be drunk. The dispersion can also be administered through a naso- gastric tube. 
Afatinib will be prescribed by  the investigator and may  be dispensed either by  the 
investigator, site staff or affiliated pharmacy via Interactive Response Technologies (I RT)at 
the beginning of each treatment course.  For adm inistrative purposes, a treatment course is 
defined as 28 day s.  Treatment will start when the patient takes the first dose of afatinib 
(
Course 1 Day  1) and continue until the criteria for stopping trial medication in Section 
3.3.4.1 are met. 
4.1.5 Blinding and procedures for unblinding
4.1.5.1 Blinding
This open -label, single -arm study  will be handled in an open fashion throughout, i.e., also for 
the purpose of data cleaning and preparation of the anal ysis. No blinding is necessary  in this 
trial, because all patients receive the same treatment.

utilize sponsor 
provided afatinib when the following requirements are fulfilled:
Approval of the stud y protocol by the institutional review board (IRB) / ethics 
committee, 
Availability  of a signed and dated clinical trial contract between the sponsor and the 
Head of Trial Centre,
Approval/notification of the regulatory  authority , e.g. competent authorit y,
Availability  of the curriculum vitae of the principal investi gator,
Availability  of a signed and dated clinical trial protocol (CTP) or immediately  
imminent signing of the clinical trial protocol, 
Availability  of the proof of a medical licence for the principal investigator (if 
applicable).
Availability  of the Form 1572 (if applicable)
The Investigator or delegate investigational drug storage manager must maintain records of 
the product’s delivery  to the trial site, the inventory  at the site, the use by
each patient, and the return to the Sponsor or alternative disposal of unused products.
These records will include dates, quantities, batch / serial numbers, expiry  (‘use -by’) dates,
and the unique code numbers assigned to the investigational product and tri al patients. The
Investigator / Pharmacist / investigational drug storage manager will maintain records that

TREATMENT
4.2.1 Rescue medication, emergency procedures, and additional treatments
4.2.1.1 Rescue medication
Rescue medications to reverse the actions of afatinib are not available . There is no specific 
antidote for over dosage with afatinib . Potential adverse events should be treated 
symptomaticall y. Common adverse events of treatment with afatinib with specified 
management recommendations and/or requirements incl ude diarrhoea, and rash/acne. To 
improve tolerability  and the probability  of clinical benefit, patients should receive prompt and 
appropriate supportive care at the first signs of s ymptoms. Suggested treatments for AEs are 
described in Section 4.4.2 .
4.2.1.2 Emergency  procedures
Careful assessment of all patients with an acute onset and/or unexplained worsening of 
pulmonary  symptoms (dy spnoea, cough, fever) should be performed to exclude ILD. Afatinib 
should be interrupted pending investigation of these sy mptoms. If interstitial lung disease is 
diagnosed, study  drug must be permanently discontinued and appropriate treatment instituted 
as necessary . 
Patients who present with sy mptoms of keratitis, such as acute or worsening ey e 
inflammation, lacrimation, light sensitivity , blurred vision, ey e pain and/or red ey e should be 
referred promptly  to an ophthalmic specialist. If a diagnosis of ulcerative keratitis is 
confirmed, treatment with afatinib should be interrupted or discontinued. If keratitis is 
diagnosed, the benefits and risks of continuing treatment with afatinib should be carefull y 
considered. Afatinib should be used with caution in patients with a history  of keratitis, 
ulcerative keratitis or severe dry  eye. Contact lens use is a risk factor for keratitis and 
ulceration.
Dermatologic adverse events and diarrhoea are the most common side -effects associated with 
treatment with afatinib. Treatment of these side- effects should be proactive and should be 
started as earl y as possibl e after onset of s ymptoms.
4.2.1.3 Additional treatments
Concomitant medications or therap y to provide adequate supportive care may be given as 
clinically  necessary . 
After stud y enrollment , palliative radiotherap y may be given for bone pain or for other 
reasons (e.g. bronchial obstruction, skin lesions), provided that the total dose delivered is in a 
palliative range according to institutional standards. The irradiated area cannot be used f or 
tumor response assessment. During palliative radiotherap y, stud y treatment should be delayed 
and may  be resumed once the patient has recovered from an y radiation -associated toxicity .  If 
medication is interrupted for more than 14 day s, the decision to c ontinue will be made by  the 
BI clinical monitor in agreement with the investigator.   Patients who are dose interrupted for

medication.
All concomitant therap y, including an aesthetic agents, vitamins, homeopathic/herbal 
remedies, nutritional supplements, must be recorded in the eCRF during the screening and 
treatment period, starting from the date of signature of informed consent, and ending at the 
EOT (end of treatment) visit. After the EOT visit, only  concomitant therap y indicated for 
treatment of an AE has to be reported. 
In case of major surgery  (as judged by  the investigator), it is recommended to stop treatment 
with afatinib around one week prior to the surgery, and to restart treatment after complete 
wound healing. If afatinib is interrupted for more than 14 day s, the decision to continue will 
be made b y the BI Clinical Monitor in agreement with the investigator.
4.2.2 Restrictions
4.2.2.1 Restrictions regarding concomi tant treatment
Concomitant medications or therap y to provide adequate supportive care may be given as 
clinically  necessary . 
Palliative radiotherap y may be given as described in Section 4.2.1.3.
Additional experimental anti- cancer treatment and/or standard chemo- , immunotherap y, 
hormone treatment (with the exception of megestrol acetate and use of anti -androgens and/or 
gonadorelin analogues for treatment of prostate cancer), or radiotherap y (other than palliative 
radiotherap y for symptom control) is not allowed concomitantly  with the administration of 
afatinib. 
Afatinib is a substrate of the P -gp transporter. Caution should be exercised when combining 
afatinib with P -gp modulators.  For a list of potent P- gp inhibitors and induc ers see Appendix 
10.2.
4.2.2.2 Restrictions on diet and life sty le
Patients should be advised to avoid any  foods known to aggravate diarrhoea .
To prevent skin related adverse events it is recommended to avoid intense irradiation with 
UV light and harsh detergents, seealso Section 4.4.2 .
4.2.2 .3Men capable of f athering a child and pregnancy  prevention
Men who are 
capable of fathering a child and whose partners have child bearing potential
must use adequate contraception throughout the trial (from screening until 28days after last 
dose of trial medication). 
Acceptable methods of contraception include surgical sterilisation and double barrier method , 
and must be in accordance with local reg ulations where applicable. Double barrier method of

intercourse. Accepted barrier methods include diaphragm, female condom, cervical cap, male 
condom and intrauterine device ( IUD) (the diaphragm and cervical cap must be used in 
conjunction with spermicidal jelly /cream). Those with partners using hormonal 
contraceptives must also be using an additional approved method of contraception (as 
described above).  Natural “rh ythm” and spermicidal jelly /cream are not acceptable methods 
of contraception.
Pregnancies that result from a male participating in this trial must be reported following BI 
internal SOP using the pregnancy  monitoring form (refer to ISF).   
4.3 TREATMENT COMPLIANCE
The study  medication will be given in accordance with the protocol and the instructions of a 
site investigator. 
The appropriate number of afatinib tablets for 28 days of treatment will be provided to 
patients to be self -administered a t home.
Patients will be asked to bring the remaining trial medication to the investigator site for a 
compliance check according to the Flowchart . The remaining film -coated tablets will be 
counted b y the investigator/site staff and recorded at the investigator site. Discrepancies 
between the number of tablets remaining and the calculated number of tablets the patients 
should have taken must be docu mented and explained. At the end of each 28 day  period, any  
remaining medication will be collected. If the patient is eligible for further treatment, a new 
bottle of study  medication must be dispensed. 
Patient’s repeatedly  missing scheduled on- treatment study  visits, unless due to exceptional 
circumstances, should be discussed with the BI trial monitor and be evaluated for 
compliance. A maximum of 25% of the dispensed afatinib doses may  be missed for other 
reason s than drug- related AEs. Patients who miss afatinib treatment more frequentl y are 
considered non -compliant.  
The investigator and/or the sponsor can withdraw a patient from the stud y in the event of 
serious and persistent non- compliance which jeopardizes the patient’s safety  or render study  
results for this patient unacceptable. 
4.4 MANAGEMENT OF DOSE REDUCTION AND EXPECTED ADVERSE 
EVENTS
4.4.1 Management of d ose reduction for afatinib
Afatinib t
reatment related toxicities will be managed b y treatment int erruptions and 
subsequent dose reductions according to the schedule described in Table 4.4.1: 1 . Dose 
reductions will apply  to individual patients only . Once the dose has been reduced, it cannot 
be increased later.

ILD is diagnosed, afatinib should be discontinued and appropriate treatment initiated as 
necessary .
In the event of an y unrelated adverse events, the investigator may choose to interrupt the 
medication for up to 14 day s, but no dose reduction should occur.  If the medication is 
interrupted for more than 14 day sfor an y reason , the decision to continue with afa tinib will 
be made b y the BI clinical monitor in agreement with the investigator.
4.4.2 Management of expected adverse events
4.4.2.1 Management of diarrhoea and h ydration status following treatment with afatinib
Diarrhea occurs at a high frequency  and generally  begins within 2 weeks of exposure to 
afatinib. Although usually  mild to moderate, diarrhea may  lead to dehy dration and require 
treatment modification or discontinuation, so early management is essential (Table 4.4.1:1 ). 
At the time of initiation of treatment with afatinib, patients should be given a supply of 
loperamide to keep with them at all times or access to loperamide should be confirmed; and 
patients should be counselled o n the appropriate use. 
Patients must be advised to drink an adequate amount of fluid to make up for the fluid lost 
through diarrhea.

Table 4.4.2 .2: 1 General recommendation for prop hylaxis while receiving afatinib
Personal hygiene Use of gentle soaps and shampoos for the body, e.g. pH5 neutral bath and 
shower formulations and tepid w ater.
Use of very mild shampoos for hair w ash.
Only clean and smooth towels are recommended because of potential risk of 
infection. The skin should be patted dry after a shower, whereas rubbing the skin 
dry should be avoide d.
Fine c otton clothes should be worn instead of synthetic material.
Shaving has to be done very carefully.
Manicure, i.e. cutting of nails, should be done straight across until the nails no 
longer extend over the fingers or toes. Cuticles are not allowed to be tri mmed 
because this procedure increases the risk of nail bed infections
Sun protection Sunscreen should be applied daily to exposed skin areas regardless of season. 
Hypoallergenic sunscreen with a high SPF (at least SPF30, PAPA free, 
UVA/UVB protection), pr eferably broad spectrum containing zinc oxide or 
titanium dioxide are recommended
Patients should be encouraged to consequently stay out of the sun.
Protective clothing for sun protection and wearing a hat should be recommended.
Moisturizer treatment It is important to moisturize the skin as soon as anti -EGFR therapy is started.
Hypoallergenic moisturizing creams, ointments and emollients should be used 
once daily to smooth the skin and to prevent and alleviate skin dryness. 
Note: avoid greasy creams (e.g . petrolatum, soft paraffin, mineral oil based) and 
topical acne medications
Prevention of paronychia Patients should keep their hands dry and out of water if ever possible.
They should avoid friction and pressure on the nail fold as well as picking or 
manipulating the nail.
Topical application of petrolatum is recommended around the nails due to its 
lubricant and smoothing effect on the skin.

5.2 SAFETY
5.2.1 Endpoints of safety
The p rimary  endpoint of the study  is the occurrence of AEs leading to dose reduction of 
afatinib. Patients without AEs leading to dose reduction of afatinib will be considered as “no ” 
for the primary  endpoint. No confirmatory anal ysis is planned (i.e. no formal hy pothesis 
testing will be performed .)
The secondary  endpoints of the study  are:
Occurrence of CTCAE grade ≥
3 diarrhea
Occurrence of CTCAE grade ≥ 3rash/acne + 
Occurrence of CTCAE grade ≥3 stomatitis +
Occurrence of CTCAE grade ≥
3 -)(*%6>:$ ) H
Time to first dose reduction of afatinib caused b y AEs, defined as time from the date 
of the first administration of afatinib to the first dose reduction of afatinib caused b y 
AEs.
In the stud y, MedDRA preferred terms that describe AEs of similar nature will be grouped 
together as “grouped term” to ensure that important events will not be underestimated. These 
grouped terms are flagged by  a ‘+’.
Endpoint sfor safet ybelonging to the category  of ‘other endpoints’ are :
Adverse events evaluated according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common 
Terminology  Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0(R12-2532) .
5.2.2 Assessment of adverse events
5.2.2.1 Definitions of adverse events
Adverse event
An adverse event (AE) is defined as an y untoward medical occurrence, including an 
exacerbation of a pre -existing condition, in a patient in a clinical investigation who received a 
pharmaceutical product. The event does not necessarily  have to have a causal relationship 
with this treatment.
Serious adverse event

2018 Boehringer Ingelheim International GmbH or one or more of its affiliated companies. All rights reserved.
This document may not -in full or in part -be passed on, reproduced, published or otherwise used without prior written permission.A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as any AE which results in death, is immediately 
life-threatening, results in persistent or significant disab ility / incapacit y, requires or prolongs 
patient hospitalisation, is a congenital anomaly  / birth defect, or is to be deemed serious for 
any other reason if it is an important medical event when based upon appropriate medical 
judgement which may  jeopardise the patient and may  require medical or surgical intervention 
to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the above definitions.
Intensit y of adverse event
The intensity  of adverse events should be classified and recorded according to the Common 
Terminology  Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0 and recorded in the eCRF .
Causal relationship of adverse event
Medical judgment should be used to determine the relationship, considering all relevant 
factors, including pattern of reaction, temporal relationship, de -challenge or re -challenge, 
confounding factors such as concomitant medication, concomitant diseases and relevant 
history . Assessment of causal relationship should be recorded in the case report forms (CRF) . 
Yes: There is a reasonable causal relationship between the investigational product 
administered and the AE. 
No: There is no reasonable causal relationship between the investigational product 
administered and the AE. 
Worsening of the underly ing disease or other pre
-existing cond itions
Disease Progression in oncology  trials is a study  endpoint for anal ysis of efficacy . Disease 
progression is exempted from reporting as a (S)AE. Progression of the patient's underl ying 
malignancy  will be recorded in the appropriate pages of the (e)CR F as part of efficacy  data 
collection. Death due to disease progression is to be recorded on the appropriate (e)CRF page 
and not on a SAE form. 
Examples of exempted events of PD are: Progression of underl ying malignancy  (Progressive 
disease PD): if PD is clearly  consistent with the suspected progression of the underl ying 
malignancy  as defined by  the respective response criteria. 
• Hospitalization/Procedures due solel y to the progression of underl ying malignancy  (PD) 
• Clinical sy mptoms and/or signs of progression (with or without confirmation by  objective 
criteria e.g. imaging, clinical measurement): if the sy mptom can exclusivel y be determined to 
be due to the progression of the underl ying malignancy  and does meet the expected pattern of 
progression for the disease under study . 
When there is evidence suggesting a causal relationship between the drug and the progression 
of the underl ying disease, the event must be reported as (S)AE on the eCRF and SAE form. 
Worsening of other pre -existing conditions will be recorded as an (S)AE in the eCRF and 
SAE form (if applicable) .

Expected Adverse Events
For expected (listed) AEs of afatinib, see the current version of the IB (Investigator’s Brochure) 
(U03 -3218-13).
5.2.2.2 Adverse event and serious adverse event reporting
All adverse events, serious and non -serious, occurring during the course of the clinical trial 
(i.e., from signing the informed consent onwards through the follow -up period of 28days 
after the last drug administration, Table 5.2.2.2:1 )will be collected, documented and reported 
to the sponsor by  the investigato r on the appropriate eCRFs / SAE reporting forms. Reporting 
will be done according to the specific definitions and instructions detailed in the ‘Adverse 
Event Reporting’ section of the Investigator Site File. 
For each adverse event, the investigator will provide the onset date, end date, intensity , 
treatment required, outcome, seriousness, and action taken with the investigational drug. The 
investigator will determine the relationship of the investigational dru g to all AEs as defined in 
Section 5.2.2.1. 
The Residual Effect Period (REP), defined as the period of time after the last dose of 
medication when measureable drug levels or pharmacody namic effects are still likely  to be 
prese nt, is 28 day s for Afatinib. A ll events reported within 28days of the last study  
medication will be considered on -treatment. 
The investigator does not need to actively monitor patients for adverse events once the 
clinical trial has ended. However, if th e investigator becomes aware of an SAE that occurred 
after the patient has completed the clinical trial, it should be reported b y the investigator to 
the sponsor if considered relevant b y the investigator.
All AEs, including those persisting after end of study  treatment must be followed up until 
they have resolved or have been sufficientl y characterized or the principal investigator 
decides to not further pursue them .

For treated patients; From signing of 
informed consent to the end of the follow -up 
visit ( 28 day s after last trial drug 
administration)Report all AEs and SAEs regardless of 
relatedness or whether the trial drug is 
administered . This includes all deaths.
After the 28 day followup visit until vital 
status followup (VS) is completedReport all related S AEs. 
After the patient has completed the study Active monitoring for adverse events is not 
required. If the investigator becomes aware of 
an SAE that occurred after the patient has 
completed the clinical trial it should be 
reported to the sponsor if cons idered relevant 
by the investigator.
If not stipulated differently  in the ISF, the investigator must report the following events using
theSAE form via fax immediately  (within 24 hours) to the sponsor: SAEs and non -serious 
AEs relevant to an SAE .The sam e timeline applies if follow -up information becomes 
available. In specific occasions, the investigator could inform the sponsor via telephone. This 
does not replace the requirement to complete and fax the BI SAE form.
BI has set up a list of AEs which are defined to be alway s serious. In order to support the 
investigator with the identification of these “always serious adverse events”, if a non -serious 
AE is identified to be serious per BI definition, a query  will be raised. The investigator must 
verify  thedescription and seriousness of the event.  I f the event description is correct, the 
item “serious” needs to be ticked and an SAE has to be reported in expedited fashion 
following the same procedure as above.
The list of these adverse events can be found v ia the Remote Data Capture (RDC) system.
With receipt of an y further information to these events, a follow -up SAE report has to be 
provided. SAEs and non -serious AEs must include a causal relationship assessment made b y 
the investigator.
The SAE form is to be forwarded to the defined unique entry  point identified for the BI OPU 
(operative unit ) (country - specific contact details will be provided in the Investigator Site 
File). This immediate report is required irrespective of whether the in vestigational product 
has been administered or not and irrespective of causal relationship. I t also applies if new 
information to existing SAEs becomes available. 
Pregnancy
In this stud y, pregnancy is not expected to occur in female participant s with the age of 70 
years or older. In rare cases, pregnancy  might occur in afemale partner of amale participant
with drug exposure to afatinib; in which case, pregnancy  must be reported following BI 
internal SOP using the pregnancy
 monitoring form (refer to ISF) .

6.1 VISIT SCHEDULE
Please refer to the Flowchart and Figure 3.1: 1for the visit schedule. All patients are to adhere 
to the visit schedule as specified in the Flow Chart .  
In case a patient misses the scheduled stud y visit but reports to the investigative site before 
the next schedul ed study  visit, the missed visit will be performed.  The current date and 
reason for the delay ed visit will be noted in the source documentation.  All subsequent study  
visits should take place at the start of the next treatment course per the flow chart.  In the 
event of an y stud y drug interruption or delay of treatment, the tumour assessment scheduled 
will not be changed.
6.2 DETAILS OF TRIAL PRO CEDURES AT SELECTED VISITS
Please refer to the Flowchart and section 5 for details of the procedures performed at each 
visit. 
6.2.1 Screening period
All patients must have documented Deletion 19and/or L858R EGFR mutation prior to the 
signing of the informed consent. All Screening procedures must be performed withi n 28 day s 
of the first dose of afatinib. Assessments required for study  participation which were 
completed as part of Standard of Care before the patient signed the informed consent may  be 
used for the screening assessments if they  were completed within th e allowed timeframe.   
However, presence of Deletion 19and/or L858R mutation may  have been determined prior 
to the 28- day screening window. 
Patients who meet the inc lusion criteria and not violate the exclusion criteria at enrolment are 
allowed to take part in this 
study .
6.2.2 Treatment period s
All p atients will receive continuous daily  treatment with afatinib until the criteria for stopping 
medication are met (Section 3 .3.4.1). Fo r administrative purposes, treatment is divide d into 
courses, which are each 4 weeks (28 days) in duration. 
During the treatment phase ,visits shoul d be performed as scheduled when ever possible, but 
within the visit window . Deviation in schedul ing for administrative purpose would be 
acceptable upon agreement between the investigator and the sponsor.
6.2.3 End of treatment visit
End of treatment visit should be performed within 7calendar day s after permanent 
discontinuation of treatment, regardl ess of the reason. If the decision to discontinue study  
treatment 
is taken during a scheduled visit, the EOT visit should be performed instead of the 
scheduled visit.

Tables that describe the frequency , time to onset, and clinical consequences will be produced 
for:
CTCAE grade ≥ 3 diarrhoea
CTCAE grade ≥3 rash/acne +
CTCAE grade ≥3 stomatitis +
CTCAE grade ≥ 3 paron ychia +
Time to first dose reduction of afatinib caused b y AEs is defined as follows: 
For patients with AEs leading to dose reduction: 
• Time _1st_dose_reduction [days] = date of 1st dose reduction – (date of start 
treatment)+1
For patients without AEs leading to dose reduction: 
• Time _1st_dose _reduction (censored)[day s]=date of last intake of afatinib –
(date of start treatment) +1
The time to first dose reduction of afatinib caused by  AE’s will be described by  Kaplan-
Meier estimates and curve.
7.3.3.3 Other anal yses
Standard tabulations arranged b y MedDRA SOC and PT will include: 
The overall incidence and intensity  of adverse events
AE judged to have been related to a fatinib
AE leading to permanent treatment discontinuation
Drug related AE leading to permanent treatment discontinuation
SAE
These standard tables will be supplemented with tables in which MedDRA SMQ and HLT
(with some modifications) will be used to group MedDRA PT for the following:
rash/acne +
stomatitis +
conjunctivitis+
paron ychia +
fatigue +
Tables that describe the frequenc y, intensit y, time to onset, and clinical consequences will be 
produced for the following AE s:

7.3.3.4 Primary  laboratory  tests
Primary  laboratory  tests are defined as:
Low values ( -): haemoglobin, total WBC, platelets, neutrophils, 
lymphocy tes, 
potas sium, magnesium, sodium, and GFR
High values (+): AST, ALT, Alkaline Phosphatase, aPTT, INR, Creatinine, Total 
Bilirubin,  and CPK
The following analyses will be presented for the primary  laboratory  tests:
descriptive statistics at each planned assessment 
frequency  of patients with transitions in CTCAE grade from baseline to worst and last 
values during treatment
frequency  of pa tients with possible clinically  significant abno rmalities
Possible clinically  significant abnormalities are defined as CTCAE grade of 2 or greater, with 
an increase of at least one grade from baseline.
7.3.4 Interim anal yses
No interim anal yses are planned for this study .
7.4 HANDLING OF MISSING 
DATA
Handling of missing data will be defined in the TSAP. The category  missing will be 
display ed in the frequency  tables only if there are actuall y missing values.
7.5 RANDOMISATION
No randomization is necessary  since this is a single arm study .
7.6 DETERMINA TION OF SAMPLE SIZE
In the general population of the LUX- Lung 3 study ,approximately  60% of the patients 
experienced AEs leading to dose reduction of afatinib. For 25patients and a 60% dose 
reduction rate (caused b y AEs), the 95% CI half -width for the dose reduction rate would be 
19.2% based on a normal approximation , resulting in a two- sided, 95% confidence interval of
(40.8%, 79.2%).  If a lower dose reduction rate of 50% is observed, the resulting 2 -sided, 
95% confidence interval would be ( 30.4%, 69.6%). Similarly , if a higher dose reduction rate 
of 70% is observed the 2 -sided, 95% confidence interval would be ( 52.0%, 88.0%).

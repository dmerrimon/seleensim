 CONFIDENTIAL  AMENDMENT HISTORY  
Amendment 5  
Change  Rationale  Section(s) Changed  
Sub-study has been included to allow 
subjects to opt to receive a booster dose of 
Moderna mRNA -1723 vaccine ≥5 months 
after completing the primary COVID -19 
vaccination series and >35 days before the 
end of the main study  (ie, until study day 
345 for subjects in arms 1, 2, 3, 6a, 6c, 7 and 
8 and until study day 331 for subjects in 
arms 4, 5, 6b, 6d and 9) . One visit was 
added for pre -booster blood sample 
collection and booster dose administration 
and a second visit wa s added for post -
booster blood sample collection. 
Nasopharyngeal swabs will be collected at 
each of the 2 visits.  
 To accommodate the 
updated CDC guidance for 
COVID -19 booster vaccines.  
 
 
To assess immune responses 
to the booster dose.  
 
To test for SARS -CoV-2 
infection.  Section 2.3 Exploratory

The observati on period definitions were  
clarified and a post -booster vaccination 
period was included.  To clarify the  definitions of 
the different observation 
period s in the study . Section  11.4.6.1  Adverse Events  
Subjects will be allowed to receive COVID -
19 booster vaccinations during the study. 
Subjects can choose to receive a third 
COVID -19 vaccine in the optional vaccine 
booster sub -study or receive COVID -19 
vaccine boosters outside of the study which 
will then be recorded as a concomitant 
medication.  To accommodate the 
updated CDC guidance for 
COVID -19 booster vaccines.  Section  8.8.1  Prohibited 
Medications and Vaccines  
Text on offering an additional vaccine to 
subjects in the affected arms if group -level 
study data identified vaccine interference 
from REGN10933+REGN10987 in one or 
more arms was removed.  An interim analysis which 
included wave 1 and 2 
subjects, the arms where the 
dose of REGEN -COV is the 
highest and thus at greatest 
risk for vaccine interference 
showed only a small  
difference in neutralizing 
mAb binding. Thus, 
significant vaccine 
interference by REGEN -
COV is unlikely.

Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc .  Page 4 
 CONFIDENTIAL  Change  Rationale  Section(s) Changed  
The CDC guidance has 
changed to allow all subjects 
to receive booster doses of 
vaccines.  
The requirements for  reporting of Grade ≥3 
ISRs  or Grade  ≥2 hypersensitivity reactions  
related to Moderna mRNA -1273  
administered as a  concomitant medication 
outside of the stu dy was  included.  To clarify that  Grade ≥3 
ISRs and Grade ≥2 
hypersens itivity reactions  
related to the Moderna 
mRNA -1273  vaccine 
administered outside the 
study should not be 
consi dered AESIs and do not 
require expedited reporting 
to the Sponsor.  Section  10.1.3  Events that 
Require Expedited Reporting to 
Sponsor  
Clarified that causality should be assessed in 
relation to the Moderna mRNA -1273 
vaccine administered as part of the main 
study or  sub-study, but not in relation to any 
vaccine administered as a concomitant 
medication outside of the study.  This clarification is now 
required because the 
Moderna mRNA -1273 
booster shot administered as 
a concomitant medication is 
no longer prohibited.  Section  10.2.5  Causality.  
Removed parenthetical referencing the post-
vaccination period  in describing SAE 
reporting , and c larified that any SAE 
assessed by the investigator as related to the 
study drug that occur subsequent to the 
reporting period  should also be reported.  Reference to the reporting 
period being  end of the post -
vaccination period was 
removed because the naming 
logic of the safety p eriod has 
changed  and post -booster 
vaccination period has been 
added . Section  10.1.1  General 
Guidelines  
Risks for the Moderna mRNA -1273 vaccine 
were updated.  To align with the latest EUA 
Fact Sheet.  Section  3.3.2  Risk-Benefit for 
Moderna mRNA -1273 Vaccine  
Text was added detailing mechanisms that 
could be implemented to ensure continuity 
of the study conduct and oversight due to 
COVID -19. To explicitly detail 
temporary or alternative 
mechanisms that could be 
utilized due to the COVID -
19 pandemic and to ensure 
appropriate documentation 
of any tempora ry or 
alternative mechanisms and 
deviation that may occur.  Section  9.1. 
The risk -benefit information was updated to 
reflect the current investigator’ s brochure .  To provide current  clinical 
data on 
REGN10933+REGN10987 . Section  3.3.1 Risk-Benefit for 
REGN 10933+REGN10987.

Five additional study arms have been 
included:  
• Two study arms, with  a third concurrent 
control arm, will simulate vaccination up 
through approximately 6 months 
following REGN10933+REGN10987 
administration.  
• One study arm, in addition to a 
concurrent control arm, will evaluate 
endogenous immune response to 
vaccination when the first vaccine dose is 
followed by REGN10933+REGN10987 
administration 6 days later.  
Enrollment in these arms will occur as two 
additional waves (wave 3 and wave 4).  
 
In total, 106 additional subjects (30 per 
REGN10933+REGN10987 treatment arms, 
and 8 per  control arms) will be enrolled. The 
justification for samples size was updated 
accordingly.  To better understand the 
temporal relationship 
between 
REGN10933+REGN10987

to have generated an appropriate vaccine 
response compared to the vaccine -only arm.  
 
This statement has been  removed, and 
vaccine cards will be made available to all 
subjects upon receipt of the vaccine as per 
the current standard of care.  Based on site feedback; 
vaccine cards indicate receipt 
of the vaccine, rather than

 CONFIDENTIAL  CLINICAL STUDY PROTO COL SYNOPSIS  
Title  A Phase 2 Randomized, Open -Label, Parallel Group Study to Assess the Immunogenicity, Safety, and 
Tolerability of Moderna mRNA -1273 Vaccine Administered with Casirivimab+Imdevimab in Healthy 
Adult Volunteers  
Site 
Locations  The study will be conducted in approximately 5 sites in the United States.  
Principal 
Investigator  To be determined  
Objectives   
Primary  • To evaluate the extent of effect, if any, of REGN10933+REGN10987 administration on vaccine -
induced neutralizing antibody responses to SARS -CoV -2 by Moderna mRNA -1273  
• To evaluate the time interval required between REGN10933+REGN10987 administration and 
Moderna mRNA -1273 vaccination, to ensure no meaningful impact on vaccine -induced 
neutralizing antibody responses to SARS -CoV -2 
Secondary  • To quantify the alteration of antigen specificity of vaccine -induced SARS -CoV -2 antibody 
responses when administered with different dose regimens of REGN10933+REGN10987  
• To evaluate the safety and tolerability of REGN10933+REGN10987 and Moderna mRNA -1273 
vaccine when administered in close succe ssion  
• To assess the concentrations of REGN10933 and REGN10987 in serum over time in subjects who 
receive REGN10933+REGN10987 and Moderna mRNA -1273 vaccine  
• To evaluate the immunogenicity of REGN10933  and REGN10987 over time  
Study 
Design  The study consists of 3 periods: a screening/baseline period, a vaccine response assessment period, 
and a follow -up period.  
Subjects will be assessed for eligibility during the screening/baseline period , which may occur up to 
21 days prior to day 1. To be  eligible for the study, subjects must be confirmed negative for current or 
past SARS -CoV -2 infection by both RT -PCR and serology tests.  
During this period, subjects will also be assigned to one of four different enrollment waves.  
On day 1, subjects will be randomized to a study arm (1 of 12) within their assigned enrollment wave. 
Subjects randomized to study arms 1 through 5 or 7 through 9 will receive an IV infusion or SC 
injection of the study drug (REGN10933+REGN10987) on day 1 or day 7. Subjects in arms 6a to 6d 
(the control arms) will not receive any study drug. The first dose of the vaccine will be administered 
on day 1 or day 15, based on study arm assignment at randomization.  
All subjects will receive the second dose of the  vaccine 28 days after their first dose of the vaccine in 
accordance with the EUA Fact Sheet.  
The vaccine response assessment period  represents the time period of the primary analysis. For study 
arms 1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 6a, and 6c, this period includes up to s tudy day 71; for study arms 4, 5, 9, 6b, and 
6d, the period includes up to day 57. Following this assessment period, subjects will enter a follow -up 
period  lasting up to 10 months.  
Throughout the study, blood samples will be collected to assess whether the  study drug impacts the 
ability of the vaccine to elicit neutralizing antibody titers against the SARS -CoV -2 S protein, and to 
understand any impact on vaccine -induced humoral and cellular immune responses to various S protein 
epitopes.  
Subjects will also  have blood samples taken at select visits for drug concentration, immunogenicity, 
and exploratory analyses, and will be monitored for AEs (including AESIs) during in -person visits. 
For subjects in study arms 4 and 5 (receiving the study drug and vaccine o n the same day), a phone 
call will be made within 24 hours following study drug and vaccine administration on day 1 for AE 
collection.

 CONFIDENTIAL  The last study visit will take place approximately 1 year after the first dose of the vaccine.  
Vaccine booster sub -study : All subjects will be offered an optional booster vaccination dose ≥5 
months after completing the primary COVID -19 vaccination series and >35 days (ie, until study day 
345 for subjects in arms 1, 2, 3, 6a, 6c, 7 and 8 and until study day 331 for subjects in arms 4, 5, 6b, 
6d and 9)  before the end of the main study. Blood samples for possible analysis will be collected pre - 
and post -booster administration.   
Study 
Duration  The duration of the study is approximately 401 days or 387 days, depending on the study arm 
assignment and length of the screening period.  
End of 
Study 
Definition  The end of study is defined as the date the last subject completes the last study visit, withdraws from 
the study, or is lost to follow -up (ie, the study subject can no longe r be contacted by the investigator).  
Population   
Sample Size  Up to approximately 286 subjects are planned to be enrolled.  
Target 
Population  Eligible subjects for this study consist of healthy adult volunteers over 18 years of age who are negative 
at screening for both SARS -CoV -2 infection and endogenous anti -SARS -CoV -2 antibodies. A 
complete listing of eligibility criteria is provided in the main text.  
Every effort should made to enroll older subjects, such that 30% to 50% of subjects enrolled at each  
site are ≥65 years of age. Efforts should also be made to enroll subjects representative of the 
demographics (eg, race and ethnic distribution) of those at risk for COVID -19 in the region where the 
study site is located.  
Treatments  Site-managed assignment.  At screening, eligible subjects will be assigned to an enrollment wave. 
The enrollment waves are intended to avoid or minimize the potential for unused doses of Moderna 
mRNA -1273 COVID -19 vaccine. Every effort should be made by sites to avoid u nused doses of 
vaccine.  
Sites will manage the placement of subjects into each wave. Every effort should be made by the site 
to ensure balance of age (<65 years and ≥65 years) within each of the enrollment waves.  
Randomization.  At baseline (day 1), subjects  will be randomized to the corresponding study arms in 
each wave. Randomization will be stratified by age (<65 years versus ≥65 years).

Hypothesis  No statistical hypothesis testing is planned in this study. Analyses of immunogenicity, safety, 
tolerability, and other data will be descriptive and exploratory in nature.  
Justification 
of Sample 
Size This study plans to enroll up to approximately 286 subjects, in order to achieve a target enrollment of 
up to approximately 30 subjects per Moderna mRNA -1273 + (REGN10933 and REGN10987) arm 
and 46 total Moderna mRNA -1273 -alone subjects. Based on the calculations provided below, this 
sample size is consider ed appropriate to meet the aims of this phase 2 study, in that it is expected to 
provide adequate precision in quantifying the magnitude of effect for the primary endpoint, as well as 
allow for an assessment of the safety and tolerability of the Moderna mR NA-1273 vaccine when 
administered with REGN10933+REGN10987.

 CONFIDENTIAL  The assumed log10 -scale standard deviation for the study is 0.30 log. This assumption is based on 
phase 1 data for the Moderna mRNA -1273 vaccine, taking the weighted average (ie, adjusting for 
sample sizes) across all doses (25,100, and 250 μg) and age groups (18 to 55, 56 to 70, and ≥71 years) 
for the neutralizing antibody titer ID50 endpoint at day 57 (Anderson, 2020) (Jackson, 2020). With a 
log-scale standard deviation of 0.30 for the primary en dpoint and a sample size of 30 and 46 subjects 
per arm, the half -width of the 95% within -group confidence interval (CI) [ie, the minimal detectable 
difference] in this study is 0.11 log and 0.09 log respectively. For between -group comparisons, the 
half-width of the 95% between -group CI for any two Moderna mRNA -1273 + (REGN10933 and 
REGN10987) arms is 0.15 log. Additionally, the half -width of the 95% between -group CI in this study 
for any individual Moderna mRNA -1273 + (REGN10933 and REGN10987) arm and the t otal 
Moderna mRNA -1273 alone subjects is 0.14 log.  
The analysis set that will be used for assessment of vaccine response allows for subjects to be excluded 
from analysis if certain confounding criteria are met (see Section 11.3.1). If 50% of subjects are 
excluded from analysis (ie, 15 subjects are analyzed per individual Moderna mRNA -1273 + 
(REGN10933 and REGN10987) arm and 23 total Moderna mRNA -1273 alone subjects are analyzed), 
the half -width of the 95% between -group CI for any two Moderna mRNA -1273 + (R EGN10933 and 
REGN10987) arms is 0.22 log. Additionally, the half -width of the 95% between -group CI for any 
individual Moderna mRNA -1273 + (REGN10933 and REGN10987) arm and Moderna mRNA -1273 
alone subjects is 0.20 log. Under this scenario, the minimal detec table difference still remains 
substantially smaller than the decrease in neutralization titers observed in a separate study of sera from 
recipients of the Moderna mRNA -1273 vaccine who were infected with South African variants (eg,

Analysis  Analysis of Primary Vaccine Response Endpoint  
The primary endpoint is the 50% inhibitory dilution (ID 50) titers of vaccine -induced neutralizing 
antibodies to SARS -CoV -2 pseudovirus, assessed on 56 days after the first dose of the vaccine. The 
56-day time point corresponds to study day 71 for study arms 1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 6a, and 6c, and study day 
57 for study arms 4, 5, 9, 6b, and 6d.  
An analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with treatment group as a fixed effect  and age as a 
covariate will be fit to the data as the primary analysis.  
The least squares mean estimates for the endpoint will be presented for each treatment group, as well 
as for the differences between treatment groups. Associated 95% CIs will also be  reported for each 
treatment group and for between -group comparisons.  
Data will be originally fitted in the log scale, and final outputs will be reported in geometric means 
and differences of the geometric means.  
Accompanying descriptive analyses will al so be provided. The analyses will be conducted based on 
the observed data with no imputation for missing data. Values below the limit of quantification (LOQ) 
will be set to half of LOQ.  
Analysis of Secondary Vaccine Response Endpoints  
The secondary endpoi nts will be analyzed in a similar manner as described for the primary endpoint.  
For these secondary endpoints, the individual time points for assessments include all post -vaccine 
scheduled timepoints during the Vaccine Response Assessment Period as descri bed in the Schedule of 
Events.  
Accompanying descriptive analyses for each endpoint at each individual time points will also be 
provided.  
Interim 
Analyses  
 Data will be reviewed periodically to provide an understanding of vaccine response in different study 
arms. Formal interim analysis may be conducted.  
Timing of 
Primary  
and Final 
Analyses  The primary vaccine response analysis will be conducted as a first -step analysis after all subjects have 
finished the primary endpoint visit (ie, 56 days after the first dose of the vaccine), in order to estimate 
the levels of neutralizing antibodies in ea ch study arm. This analysis represents the final analysis of 
the primary endpoint and is not considered an interim analysis. The SAP will be issued prior to this 
analysis.  
After all subjects finish 1 -year of follow -up, a final study analysis will be condu cted.

 CONFIDENTIAL  1. INTRODUCTION  
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS -CoV -2) is a novel RNA betacoronavirus, 
initially identified in patients experiencing atypical pneumonia in Wuhan City, China (Zhu,  2020) 
and later identified as the causative pathogen of coronavirus dis ease 2019 (COVID -19) 
(WHO,  2020 ). 
Coronaviruses consist of an RNA genome packaged in nucleocapsid (N) protein. The resulting 
capsid is surrounded by an outer envelope com prised of membrane (M) protein and envelope (E) 
protein, which are involved in virus assembly, and spike (S) protein, which mediates entry into 
host cells. The S protein is essential for virus infectivity and is the main target of the humoral 
immune respon se, as demonstrated by serology analysis of recovered COVID -19 patients 
(Long,  2020 ). By mediating binding to the host receptor angiotensin -converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), 
the S protein facilitates membrane fusion and entry of the virus into susceptible cells 
(Hoffmann,  2020 ). The S protein is itself composed of 2 functional subunits: the S1 subunit, which 
contains the receptor binding domain (RBD) responsible for binding to ACE2 on host cells, and 
the S2 subunit, which mediates fusion of the viral and cellular membranes (Walls, 2020 ).  
Over 200 COVID -19 vaccines are currently in preclinical or clinical development, and many of 
these employ mechanisms involving S protein neutralization (WHO, 2021 ). On 11 Dec 2020, the 
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued the first Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for a 
COVID -19 vaccine (Pfizer -BioNTech COVID‑19 Vaccine) in individuals ≥16 years old 
(FDA,  2020b ). Similar authorizations were subsequently issued for mRNA -1273 (18 Dec 2020), 
a COVID -19 vaccin e developed by Moderna, as well as a vaccine developed by Janssen 
Pharmaceuticals (27 Feb 2021), both in individuals ≥18 years old (Baden, 2020 ). On 03 Jan 2022, 
the EUA of the Pfizer -BioNTech vaccine was revised to include vaccination of individuals 5 -11 
years old who have undergon e solid organ transplantation or who are diagnosed with conditions 
that are considered to have an equivalent level of immunocompromise (FDA, 2022 ). Each of these 
vaccines elicit robust, dose -dependent neutralizing and other polyclonal antibodies against the S 
protein RBD (Polack, 2020 ) (Sadoff, 2021 ) (Jackson, 2020 ), and in phase 3 trials have shown over 
90% (Pfizer -BioNTech, Moderna) and over 60% (Janssen) efficacy in preventing symptomatic 
COVID -19 illness compared with placebo (Baden, 2020 ) (Polack, 2020 ) (Sadoff, 2021 ).  
Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Regeneron) has developed monoclonal antibodies (m Abs) 
directed against the RBD of the SARS -CoV -2 S protein. Casirivimab  (REGN10933) and 
imdevimab (REGN10987) are human, IgG1 mAbs that bind simultaneously to the RBD and block 
interaction with ACE2. As a co -administered combination therapy, REGN10933+REGN1 0987 
(casirivimab+imdevimab; also referred to by the proprietary name conditionally accepted by the 
FDA, REGEN -COV™) is being evaluated for the treatment and prevention of SARS -CoV -2 
infection.  
REGN10933+REGN10987 exhibits potent SARS -CoV -2 neutralization  in pseudovirus assays 
using wildtype Spike (Baum, 2020 ), and Spike sequences found in several variants of concern  
(UK B.1.1.7 [alpha], South Africa B.1.351 [beta], California B.1.429 [epsilon], India B.1.617.2 
[delta], and Brazil P.1 [gamma]) (REGEN -COV™ (casirivimab and imdevimab) [HCP Fact 
Sheet], 2022 ) (Weinreich , 2020 ) . The REGN10933+REGN10987 antibodies have significantly 
diminished potency and are not expected to be active against the recent Om icron variant  
(REGEN -COV™ (casirivimab and imdevimab) [HCP Fact Sheet], 2022 ).

 CONFIDENTIAL  The combination therapy is being evaluated for the treatment and prevention of SARS -CoV -2 
infection, and in phase 3 clinical trials was shown to be effective an d well -tolerated in the treatment 
of outpatient and hospitalized adults with COVID -19, and in the prevention of SARS -CoV -2 
infection in adults and adolescents (Horby, 2021 ) (O’Brien, 2021a ) (O’Brien, 2021b ) 
(Weinreich,  2021b ) (see Section  3.3.1  additional information) . REGN10933+REGN10987 (1200 
mg IV or SC; 600 mg of each mAb) is currently authorized under EUA for the treatment of 
outpatients 12 years and older who are at high risk for developing severe COVID -19 
(FDA, 2020a ).  
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) currently recommends deferring the 
receipt of a COVID -19 vaccine dose by 30 days following the use of passive antibody therapies 
for post -exposure prophylaxis and by 90 days following pass ive antibody therapies used for the 
treatment of COVID -19 (CDC, 2021 ). Currentl y, however, there are no published experimental 
data on potential pharmacodynamic interactions between anti -SARS -CoV -2 mAbs and COVID -
19 vaccines to inform this recommendation. Empirical assessment of the potential immunological 
impact of mAb administratio n on COVID -19 vaccination is thus urgently needed.  
This is a phase 2, randomized, open -label, parallel group study in healthy adult volunteers to assess 
the immunogenicity, safety, and tolerability of Moderna mRNA -1273 vaccine when administered 
with REGN1 0933+REGN10987. A central focus of the study will be to assess whether 
REGN10933+REGN10987 interferes with the ability of the Moderna mRNA -1273 vaccine to 
elicit neutralizing antibody titers against the SARS -CoV -2 S protein, and to gain a clearer 
mechanist ic understanding of any observed alteration of vaccine -induced humoral and cellular 
immune responses to various S protein epitopes. The study is designed to replicate hypothetical 
clinical scenarios in which mAbs may be administered in conjunction with a C OVID -19 vaccine, 
as well as simulate different time intervals between mAb and vaccine administration (using 
decreasing mAb dose concentrations as a proxy) to identify optimal dose timing in the event that 
interference with vaccine -induced immunity is obser ved. A detailed discussion of the rationale for 
the study design is provided in Section  3.2.  
Additional background information on REGN10933+REGN10987  and development program can 
be found in the Investigator’s Brochure.

 CONFIDENTIAL  3. HYPOTHESES AND RATIO NALE  
3.1. Hypotheses  
The clinical hypotheses of the study are that (1) REGN10933 -REGN10987 does not alter the 
immunogenicity of Moderna mRNA -1273 vaccine and (2) REGN10933+REGN10987 and 
Mode rna mRNA -1273, when administered in close succession, are well tolerated.  
There is no statistical hypothesis in this descriptive study (Section  11.1). 
3.2. Rationale  
3.2.1.  Rationale for Study Design  
3.2.1.1.  Primary Objectives: Potential Alteration of Endogenous Immune Responses  
Monoclonal antibody therapies such as REGN10933+REGN10987 will continue to play an 
important role in COVID -19 treatment and/or prevention, even as COVID -19 vaccination becomes 
more widespread.  There is a theoretical risk, however, that mAb treatments may a lter the vaccine -
induced immune responses, by binding to and thereby blocking key antigenic determinants that 
generate protective immunity. The primary objective of this study is thus to understand whether 
REGN10933+REGN10987, when administered in the sett ing of treatment or prevention of 
COVID -19, will alter the response to COVID -19 vaccines such as Moderna mRNA -1273.  
To accomplish the primary study objective, REGN10933+REGN10987 will be evaluated using 
dose levels that have either been authorized under EUA for the treatment of COVID -19 and/or for 
which clinical trial data indicate efficacy in treating or preventing COVID -19 (Section  3.2.2 ). The 
study is thus designed to mirror hypothetical clinical ‘use case’ scenarios, for which the two 
administration modalities of REGN10933+REGN10987 may be employed in close proximity to 
COVID -19 vaccination or mimic waiting for vaccination for up to 6 months after a  1200 mg dose 
of REGEN -COV.  
For the hypothetical treatment use case (ie, administration of REGN10933+REGN10987 1200  mg 
IV in a SARS -CoV -2-positive individual, followed by subsequent vaccination against future 
infection), Moderna mRNA -1273 will be administ ered 14 days after intravenous 
REGN10933+REGN10987. The use of an intervening period of time is based on public health 
recommendations to avoid COVID -19 vaccination during an active SARS -CoV -2 infection. The 
14-day interval was selected to ensure adequate time for the distribution of 
REGN10933+REGN10987 from the plasma compartment into tissues.  
For the hypothetical prophylaxis use case (ie, administration of REGN10933+REGN10987 1200 
mg SC in a SARS -CoV -2-negative individual for short -term protection agains t exposure, with 
administration of COVID -19 vaccination for long -term protection), REGN10933+REGN10987 
will be administered on the same day as Moderna mRNA -1273. Simultaneous administration of 
both antibody therapy and vaccination has been used as effectiv e post -exposure prophylaxis for 
several pathogens, including rabies virus and hepatitis A virus (Manning, 2008 ) (Nelson, 2018 ). 
In addition to the above use case scenarios, the study will evaluate endogenous immune responses 
over time when 1200 mg IV of REGN10933+REGN10987 is administered 6 days after the first 
dose of Moderna mRNA -1273 (ie, study day 7). This interval was chosen t o allow adequate 
                                        VV-RIM-00182647-1.0 Approved - 28 Jan 2022 GMT-5:00

 CONFIDENTIAL  production and presentation of S protein antigens following vaccination and is thus intended to 
represent a scenario in which the immune system is “primed” prior to treatment with 
REGN10933+REGN10987. This will allow for assessment of safe ty of 
REGN10933+REGN10987 administration in close temporal proximity to vaccination. In the event 
REGN10933+REGN10987 is found to interfere with the endogenous immune response to 
vaccination when given prior to or concomitantly with vaccination, this will allow assessment of 
whether, in the prophylaxis setting, vaccination prior to REGN10933+REGN10987 administration 
will allow high risk subjects to receive both long term and short term protection from vaccination 
and REGN10933+REGN10987 administration follo wed shortly thereafter.  
3.2.1.2.  Primary Objectives: Exploration of Time Intervals  
It is anticipated that REGN10933+REGN10987 will not alter the generation of endogenous, 
protective immune responses to Moderna  mRNA -1273 vaccination. Vaccine responses are 
polyclona l, and the presence of mAb therapeutics may not alter neutralizing Ab generation to all 
S-protein epitopes. Additionally, we anticipate that presentation of peptides for T -cell priming will 
not be affected by mAb therapeutics. Finally, preliminary observat ions from subjects with SARS -
CoV -2 infection in treatment trials of REGN10933+REGN10987 have demonstrated intact IgG 
responses to SARS -CoV -2 antigens.  
However, it is possible that mAbs could meaningfully alter immune responses to vaccination. In 
light of this possibility, the other primary objective of this study is to understand the optimal time 
interval between mAb therapeutics and COVID -19 vaccinations. As a precautionary measure, 
the CDC has recommended a 90 -day deferral period prior to vaccination in those who have 
received passive antibody therapy for COVID -19 treatment. The CDC has also recommended a 
30-day deferral period prior to vaccination in those who have received passive antibody therapy 
for post -exposure prophylaxis. These recommendations wer e based on the estimated half -life of 
such products and the anticipated period of protection against infection when receiving anti -SARS -
CoV -2 monoclonal antibodies for post -exposure prophylaxis or reinfection when receiving passive 
antibody therapy for tre atment  (CDC, 2021 ).  
In this study,  several additional doses levels below 1200 mg will be administered at day 1 ( Figure  1 
and Table  2). Sequentially lower dose levels were chosen as a means to vary the concentration of 
REGN10933+REGN10987 that exists at the time of Moderna  mRNA -1273 vaccin ation. This 
method is intended to simulate various time intervals that could occur between administr ation of 
REGN10933+REGN10987 at 1200 mg and vaccination with Moderna  mRNA -1273 . This 
approach – altering the dose level rather than the time interval – was selected because 
REGN10933+REGN10987 concentration (and not time) is the key factor impacting the li kelihood 
of altering vaccine responses. Moreover, the approach is operationally more feasible, and (by 
avoiding the need to test variable and potentially lengthy time intervals) lowers the likelihood of 
subjects becoming exposed to SARS -CoV -2 exposure duri ng the study, which would confound 
the interpretation of results. Additional information regarding the selection of dose levels in this 
study is provided in Section  3.2.2 . 
Taken together, the primary objectives in this study  are intended to provide information that 
may guide  physicians and public health agencies  in making  evidence -based recommendations on 
the usage of the Moderna mRNA -1273 COVID -19 vacci ne in the setting of 
REGN10933+REGN10987 therapy or prevention. As COVID -19 vaccines employing S protein

 CONFIDENTIAL  neutralization as their mode of action are likely to produce comparable antibody responses and 
protective immunity (an assumption supported by some ini tial experimental data for some vaccines 
(Garcia -Beltran, 2021 ) it is anticipated that the data generated  from this study can potentially be 
extrapolated to the general case of S -protein -based COVID -19 vaccines given in the setting of 
mAbs targeting the S protein RBD.  
3.2.1.3.  Selection and Interpretation of Primary Endpoint  
Although quantitative correlates of protective immunity against SARS -CoV -2 are not yet 
established, the presence of serum neutralizing antibodies has been shown to correlate with 
protection from viral reinfection for other respiratory viruses, including in fluenza virus 
(Verschoor, 2015 ) and respiratory syncytial virus (Kulkarni, 2018 ). Neutralizing antibody titers 
are accepted as a general functional biomarker of the endogenous ability to block viral infection 
of target ce lls in vivo (Jackson, 2020 ). In the absence of clear correlates of vaccine -induced 
protection against COVID -19, reduced neutralization can serve as a useful benchmark to interpret 
any observed impact of mAb thera py on the development of an immune response to Moderna 
mRNA -1273 vaccine. Accordingly, the primary objective will be assessed by quantifying 
endogenous neutralizing antibody titers following vaccination administered with or without 
REGN10933+REGN10987. Whi le the threshold of SARS -CoV -2-neutralizing antibody titers 
associated with meaningful clinical efficacy in treating or preventing COVID -19 are currently 
unknown, this study is designed with a sufficient sample size to provide a minimal detectable 
differen ce of 0.15 log (refer to Section  11.2). This precision is considered adequate to meet the 
aims of this phase 2 study (ie, to both quantify the magnitude of effect for the primary endpoint 
and to allow assessment of the safety and tolerability of the Moderna mRNA -1273 vaccine when 
administered with REGN10933+REGN1098).  
The primary endpoint will be assessed during the vaccine response assessment pe riod, which 
includes the first 56 days after the first dose of Moderna mRNA -1273 (Section  4.1 and 
Section  6.1.1 ). SARS -CoV -2-neutralizing antibodies induced by Moderna mRNA -1273 vaccine 
can be detected as early as 2 weeks after the first vaccine dose, with titers peaking on day 36 (35 
days after the  first dose and one week after the second dose of the vaccine), and remaining at peak 
levels at day 57 and day 119 (pseudovirus serum neutralizing infectious dose 50 [ID 50] titers 
between 256 to 1024) (Jackson, 2020 ) (Widge, 2021 ). Assessing the primary en dpoints after 56 
days of the first dose of vaccine will thus maximize the ability to detect the effect of mAb 
administration on vaccine responses (Jackson, 2020 ). Additional analyses of neutralizing antibody 
titers at approximately 6 months, 9 months, and 1 year after vaccine administration will assess 
long-term/memory immune response to SARS -CoV -2 following vaccination with Moderna 
mRNA -1273.  
An open -label design was chosen for this study, as it is considered app ropriate and sufficient for 
achieving the primary objective, as well as the other pharmacodynamic objectives, of the study.  
3.2.1.4.  Selection of Moderna mRNA -1273 for Vaccine Response Analysis  
The primary aim of this study is to evaluate the impact of REGN10933+R EGN10987 on the 
induction of endogenous neutralizing immune responses to Moderna mRNA -1273. Moderna 
mRNA -1273 COVID -19 vaccine has demonstrated sufficient safety, tolerability and efficacy to 
receive EUA for active immunization against SARS -CoV -2 in indivi duals ≥18 years of age

 CONFIDENTIAL  (Moderna COVID -19 Vaccine [HCP Fact She et], 2022 ). The vaccine was shown to elicit robust, 
dose-dependent neutralizing titers against full -length S protein and against the S protein RBD, 
when measured using a pseudotyped lentivirus (PsVNA) assay (Jackson, 2020 ), and in a phase 3 
study of 30,420 volunteers, reduced the rates of symptomatic COVID -19 illness by over 90% 
compared to placebo (Baden, 2020 ). The robust neutralizing titers observed in clinical studies are 
anticipated to provide an opportunity for eva luating any impact of REGN10933+REGN10987 on 
immune response to vaccine. Any alteration of neutralization that may be observed in this trial will 
require further study.  
3.2.1.5.  Selection of Neutralizing Titer Assay  
Serum neutralizing titers to Moderna mRNA -1273 va ccine will be assessed by a recombinant 
Vesicular Stomatitis Virus (rVSV) encoding SARS -CoV -2 S protein -based method 
(Vandergaast,  2020 ), similar to the assay reported in published reports of mRNA -1273 vaccine 
(Jackson, 2020 ) (Widge, 2021 ). The assay will be further validated with an additional anti -idioty pe 
antibody step to block interference of REGN10933+REGN10987 in the measurement of the 
endogenous response to the vaccine. The impact of REGN10933+REGN10987 neutralizing Ab 
responses to S proteins from other viral variants may also be studied, if assays b ecome available.  
3.2.1.6.  Secondary and Exploratory Analyses of Immune Response  
It is possible that exogenous mAb treatments could skew or otherwise alter the antigen specificity 
of endogenous antibody responses elicited by Moderna mRNA -1273 vaccine. SARS -CoV -2 
binding antibody assessments to S -protein trimer and S1 RBD will be performed using a Meso 
Scale Diagnostics (MSD) kit that has been used to measure neutralizing antibody responses in 
Phase 3 vaccine trials with Moderna mRNA -1273. The assay will be adapted w ith an anti -idiotype 
step to block the interference of REGN10933+REGN10987 with the measurement of endogenous 
antibodies.  
In order to fully characterize the possible effects of REGN10933+REGN10987 on immune 
responses to Moderna mRNA -1273, we will evaluate  cellular immune responses. Additional 
exploratory assays may be used to measure immunoglobulin titers to specific SARS -CoV -2 
antigens (such as further epitope mapping of endogenous vaccine response) following vaccination. 
Similarly, B -cell responses follo wing vaccination could reveal subtle immunologic effects of mAb 
therapy on vaccine response. To this end, the study will explore circulating B cell response specific 
to SARS -CoV -2 S trimer protein, RBD, and other spike subdomains.  Additional analyses of T cell 
immune  responses to Moderna mRNA -1273 in the presence of REGN10933+REGN10987 will 
also be performed and may  reveal  important  mechanistic  insights into any  observed immune 
interaction.  
Although the global emergence of variants has occurred only relati vely recently in the history of 
the pandemic, emerging data suggest that they pose a significant threat to the clinical efficacy of 
some vaccines and therapies (AstraZeneca, 2021 ) (FDA, 2021 ). Recent evidence suggests that 
neutralizing humoral immunity induced by Moderna mRNA -1273 vaccination is reduced against 
specific SARS -CoV -2 variants (ie, B.1.351) (Garcia -Beltran, 2021 ). In this study, exploratory 
studies may be  conducted to understand if REGN10933+REGN10987 alters the neutralization 
capacity seen with these viral variants after vaccination.

 CONFIDENTIAL  3.2.1.7.  Study Population  
The population for this study includes healthy volunteers who are both seronegative and RT -PCR 
negative f or SARS -CoV -2 at screening/baseline, as this will maximize the ability to measure any 
effects of REGN10933+REGN10987 on immune responses to Moderna mRNA -1273 vaccine. 
Randomization will be stratified by age (<65 years versus ≥65 years), as older individual s may be 
less likely to have robust humoral immunity following vaccination and more likely to benefit from 
mAbs in the prevention or treatment of COVID -19.  
3.2.1.8.  Safety and Tolerability  
REGN10933+REGN10987, when given concomitantly or in temporal proximity to M oderna 
mRNA -1273, is reasonably expected to be well -tolerated in healthy volunteers (see Section  3.1). 
Nevertheless, this study will evaluate safety and tolerability of REGN10933+REGN10987 and 
Moderna mRNA -1273, including assessment of IRR (REGN10933+REGN10987) as well as ISR 
and hypersensiti vity reactions (REGN10933+REGN10987 and Moderna mRNA -1273; see 
Section  4).  
As a precautionary safety measure, a follow -up phone call will be made with in 24 hours after study 
drug and vaccine administration, for subjects receiving these concomitantly (see Section  9.2.2 ). 
3.2.1.9.  Use of Enrollment Waves  
During  the screening/baseline period, subjects will be assigned by each site to different enrollment 
waves, which are used to group study arms. The enrollment waves are staggered (eg, effort should 
be done so that study day 15 for wave 1 should occur on the same  day as study day 1 for wave 2; 
see Figure  2). The primary intent of this staggering is to increase the number of study subjects who 
can be scheduled for  vaccination on the same day at each site, and thus avoid or minimize the 
potential for unused doses of COVID -19 vaccine.  
Although assignment to enrollment waves will be performed by the sites, assignment to study arms 
within each wave will occur via rand omization. To minimize the potential for bias in study arm 
assignment, each wave will include a separate vaccine -only control arm, included as part of the 
randomization scheme. In addition, sites will be instructed to make every effort to balance 
assignmen t into each wave according to age, the baseline characteristic that is considered to have 
the greatest potential impact on susceptibility of mAb -mediated interference to vaccine response.  
Refer to Section  8.5 for additional information on site -managed assignment to enrollment waves 
and subsequent randomization to study arms.  
3.2.2.  Rationale for Dose Selection  
This parallel group study will utilize 12 stu dy arms, of which 8 will receive single -dose 
administration of REGN10933+REGN10987 and administration of the Moderna mRNA -1273 
COVID -19 vaccine ( Figure  1) before, after or concurrently with REGEN -COV administration. 
Study arms 6a, 6b, 6c and 6d will only receive the vaccine.  
For all study arms that include IV administration of REGN10933+REGN10987 followed by 
Moderna mRNA -1723, a 14 -day interval was chosen t o ensure that mAb concentrations in serum 
are in the post -distribution phase, and therefore representative of concentrations in equilibrium 
with relevant peripheral tissues (ie, the site of a potential immune interaction).

3.2.2.1.  Study Arm 1 and Arm 9 (1200 mg IV)  
REGN10933+REGN10987 1200 mg IV (600 mg per mAb) was selected as a potential use case 
scenario based on clinical efficacy data in treatment of COVID -19 (Section  3.3.1 ).  
The rationale for study arm 9 (administration of REGN10933+REGN10987 after the first dose of 
Modern mRNA -1723 vaccine) is provided in Section  3.2.1.1 . 
3.2.2.2.  Study Arm 2 (300 mg IV), Arm 3 (150 mg IV), Arm 7 (48 mg IV), and Arm 8 (12 
mg IV)  
As outlined in Section  3.2.1.3 , one of the primary objectives of this study is to identify time 
intervals between administration of REGN10933+REGN10987 and Moderna mRNA -1273 that 
may mitigate any observed potential alteration of vaccine efficacy, and to utilize various dose 
levels as a means of simulating these time intervals. To this end, a preliminary population 
pharmacokinetics (PopPK) model was developed based on available REGN10933 and 
REGN10987 concentration da ta from studies COV -2067 and COV -2069. The PopPK model was 
                                        VV-RIM-00182647-1.0 Approved - 28 Jan 2022 GMT-5:00

 CONFIDENTIAL  used to determine dose levels of REGN10933+REGN10987 that would achieve concentrations in 
serum on study day 15 (when Moderna mRNA -1723 is administered), that approximate particular 
time intervals following a 1200 mg IV dose (Section  3.2.1.2 ).  
Table  1 provides the estimated time intervals for each of the study arms used for these anchoring 
analyses. As an example of this simulation, 300 mg IV of REGN10933+REGN10987 administered 
on day 1, followed by the administration of the first dose of Modern a mRNA -1723 on day 15, 
simulates a scenario in which an individual receives a single 1200 mg IV dose of 
REGN10933+REGN10987, and then begins their vaccination with Moderna mRNA -1723 
approximately 60 days later.

REGN10933+REGN10987 1200 mg SC (600 mg per mAb) was selected as a potential use case 
scenario based on clinical efficacy data in prevention of COVID -19. The 600 mg SC (300 per 
mAb) dose was also chosen as a potential use case, based on virologic efficacy observed at that 
dose level (Section  3.3.1 ). The rationale for concomitant administration of vaccine is provided in 
Section  3.2.1.1 . 
3.3. Risk -Benefit  
Risk-benefit  is provided separately for REGN10933+REGN10987 (Section  3.3.1 ), Moderna 
mRNA -1273 vaccine (Section  3.3.2 ), and REGN10933+REGN10987 administered with 
COVID -19 vaccines (Section  3.3.3 ). 
3.3.1.  Risk -Benefit for REGN10933+REGN10987  
The anticipated risks and benefits of casirivimab and imdevimab are informed by pre -clinical and 
clinical data, including data from phase 3 trials. For additional information concerning clinical and 
pre-clinical data, refer to the Investigator’s Brochure.  
Intravenous Administration of Casirivimab+Imdevimab in Clinical Trials. In COV -2067, the 
phase 3 outpatient treatment trial, a single intravenous dose of casirivimab and imdevimab was 
shown (relative to placebo) to  reduce  COVID -19-related hospitalizations or all -cause death by 
71.3% (2400 mg dose) and 70.4% (1200 mg dose), reduce symptom duration by 4 days (2400 mg 
and 1200 mg), and reduce viral load over the first 7 days. Serious adverse events occurred more 
frequently in the p lacebo group (4.0%) than in either treatment group (2400 mg, 1.1%; 1200 mg, 
1.3%), and grade ≥2 infusion -related reactions were infrequent (<0.3% in all groups)

 CONFIDENTIAL  (Weinreich,  2021b ). Similar virologic efficacy and a similar safety profile were observed in the 
phase 1/2 portion of this trial, which evaluated casirivimab and imdevimab at 8000 mg and 2400 
mg IV doses (Weinreich, 2021a ). 
Subcutaneous Administration of Casirivimab+Imdevimab in Clinical Trials. In COV -2069, 
the phase 3 prevention trial in those at high risk of infection by a household contact, a single 
subcutaneous dose of casirivimab and imdevima b (1200 mg) reduced (relative to placebo) 
symptomatic SARS -CoV -2 infection by 81.4%, and reduced overall SARS -CoV -2 infection by 
66.4%. Serious adverse events occurred at similar frequencies in the treatment group (1%) and 
placebo group (1%). Injection -site reactions were more common in the treatment group (4%) 
compared to the placebo group (2%), but no injection -site reactions in the study were grade 3 or 
above.  The majority of injection site reactions occurred within one day and resolved within two 
days (O’Brien, 2021b ).  
Among a sub -group of individuals in COV -2069 who were identified as SARS -CoV -2 positive 
but asymptomatic during screening, a single subcutaneous dose of casirivimab and imdevimab 
(1200 mg) reduced (relative to placebo) progression to sym ptomatic disease by 31.5%, and 
reduced the duration of symptoms in those that developed symptomatic infections. Injection -site 
reactions were more common in the treatment group (4%) compared to the placebo group (1%), 
but no injection -site reactions in the  study were grade 3 or above (O’Brien, 2021a ).  
In COV -2069, e fficacy results were similar in adolescents (age 12 to <18) as observed in adults: 
0% of subjects in the 1200 mg SC treatment group experienced symptomatic infection, c ompared 
with 9.3% of subjects in the placebo group. Safety data in adolescent subjects were also similar to 
that observed in adults. Injection site reactions were more common in the treatment group (5.9%) 
compared to the placebo group (1.6%), but none were  grade 3 or above in any group.  
In COV -2093, the adult volunteer study evaluating multiple doses of subcutaneous administration 
of casirivimab+imdevimab (monthly dosing over 6 months), injection site reactions were more 
common in the casirivimab and imdev imab group (34.6%) compared with the placebo group 
(15.8%), but none were grade 3 or above in any group.  
Identified Risks. As with other protein therapeutics, hypersensitivity reactions, including acute 
infusion -related reactions (IV administration) or inj ection site reactions (SC administration), may 
develop after study drug administration. Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, 
infusion -related reactions or injection site reactions, have been observed in patients who received 
REGN10933+REGN109 87. 
Potential or Theoretical Risks. The important potential risks of REGN10933+REGN10987 are 
the clinical consequences of immunogenicity , embryo -fetal toxicity  and antiviral resistance . 
Protein therapeutics carry the potential risk of an immunogenic respon se in the form of anti -drug 
antibody (ADA) and neutralizing antibody (NAb) development following administration, with 
possible consequences on safety and efficacy. Therefore, blood samples for immunogenicity 
assessment will be collected during the studies.   
Reproductive and developmental toxicology studies have not been conducted; therefore, the 
effects of REGN10933, REGN10987, and REGN10933+REGN10987 combination therapy on the 
fetus and reproductive organs in males and females are unknown. Human immunoglob ulin G1 
(IgG1) antibodies are known to cross the placental barrier and are present in breast milk; therefore,

 CONFIDENTIAL  the REGN10933+REGN10987 combination therapy have the potential to be transferred from the 
mother to the developing fetus or a breastfed child. Giv en the high affinity and specificity of 
REGN10933 and REGN10987, off -target pharmacological effects are not anticipated in either the 
mother or the fetus, and no off -target binding of REGN10933 or REGN10987 was observed in 
any of the human or monkey tissue s evaluated ex vivo in tissue cross -reactivity studies. However, 
it is unknown whether the potential transfer of the combination of REGN10933+REGN10987 
therapy provides any treatment benefit or risk to the developing fetus or a breastfed child.  
There is cu rrently limited clinical experience in the use of REGN10933, REGN10987, and 
REGN10933+REGN10987 combination therapy in females who are pregnant or breastfeeding. 
The combination of REGN10933+REGN10987 therapy should be used during pregnancy or 
breastfeedin g only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk for the mother and the fetus or 
breastfed child considering all associated health factors. If a female subject is pregnant or were to 
become pregnant while receiving REGN10933+REGN10987 combinati on, the pregnancy should 
be followed until outcome and any safety issue observed get reported.  
REGN10933+REGN10987 combination therapy was strategically designed to be a combination 
therapy of 2 non-competing antibodies that can simultaneously bind distin ct epitopes of the SARS -
CoV -2 S protein to reduce the likelihood of antiviral resistance and provide coverage against 
circulating variants. However, there is a potential risk of treatment failure due to circulating or 
treatment -emergent SARS -CoV -2 variants  that are resistant to REGN10933+REGN10987 
combination.  
Ongoing sequencing analyses of nasopharyngeal swab samples from sponsor -conducted clinical 
studies have found no evidence that the clinical use of REGN10933+REGN10987  leads to the 
selection of escape (treatment emergent) variants in REGN10933+REGN10987 -binding epitopes, 
within the RBD, or other regions of the S protein .  
The in vitro neutralization potency of REG N10933+REGN10987  and its individual components 
is continu ously monitored against S protein variants, including VUS, variants identified in in vitro 
escape studies, and variants from publicly available SARS -CoV -2 genome data (eg, GISAID). 
REGN10933+REGN10987 demonstrates in vitro neutralization activity below the  limit of 
quantitation against the Omicron variant, and it is unlikely that REGN10933+REGN10987 will be 
active against this variant. However, REGN10933+REGN10987 retains activity against the Alpha, 
Beta, Gamma, Delta, Epsilon, Iota, Kappa, and Mu variants.  It is not known how in vitro 
neutralization data correlate with clinical outcomes.  
Decisions regarding the use of REGN10933+REGN10987 should take into consideration what is 
known about the characteristics of circulating variants including regional or geo graphical 
differences and available information on REGN10933+REGN10987 susceptibility patterns.  
There may also be a potential for the REGN10933+REGN10987 combination to interfere with an 
individual’s endogenous immune response to either SARS -CoV -2 infectio n or to effectiveness of 
vaccination against COVID -19. Refer to Section  3.3.3  for more information.  
Antibody -dependent enhancement (ADE) has been obse rved for some therapeutics targeting 
exogenous viral proteins. For antibody therapies, ADE is thought to occur when binding of 
antibody to the target viral protein enhances Fc gamma receptor (FcγR) -mediated host cell entry 
of the virus (Iwasaki, 2020 ). This could potentially lead to worsening of disease and, in the case 
of SARS, acute lung injury (Liu, 2019 ). REGN10933 and REGN10987 retain the Fc region, as 
                                        VV-RIM-00182647-1.0 Approved - 28 Jan 2022 GMT-5:00

 CONFIDENTIAL  this may play a role in protecting against viral infection (Yasui,  2014), and there is no strong 
eviden ce of ADE in other coronavirus models (Kam, 2007 ) (Liu, 2019 ) (Luo, 2018 ). To date, Fc -
containing mAbs developed by the Sponsor for Ebola virus and MERS -CoV have demonstrated 
specificity to their exogenous targets with no significant unexpected safety findings in preclinical 
or clinical studies. All subjects receiving REGN10933+REGN10987 will have safety fo llow-up 
assessments during the drug elimination period.  
3.3.2.  Risk -Benefit for Moderna mRNA -1273 Vaccine  
Always refer to the latest EUA Fact Sheet  (Moderna COVID -19 Vaccine [Patient Fact Sheet], 
2022 )  . Information from the current version of the Fact Sheet (dated 07 January 2022) is provided 
below:  
Benefit. In an ongoing clinical trial, Moderna mRNA -1273 vaccine  has been shown to prevent 
COVID -19 following 2 doses given 1 month apart. The duration of protection against C OVID -19 
is currently unknown.  
Risks.  
There is a remote chance that the Moderna COVID -19 Vaccine could cause a severe allergic 
reaction. A severe allergic reaction would usually occur within a few minutes to one hour after 
getting a dose of the Moderna COV ID-19 Vaccine. For this reason, the vaccination provider may 
ask the vaccine recipients to stay at the place where they received the vaccine for monitoring after 
vaccination. Signs of a severe allergic reaction can include:  
• Difficulty breathing  
• Swelling of  face and throat  
• A fast heartbeat  
• A bad rash all over body  
• Dizziness and weakness  
Myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) and pericarditis (inflammation of the lining outside 
the heart) have occurred in some people who have received the Moderna COVI D-19 Vaccine, 
more commonly in males under 40 years of age than among females and older males. In most of 
these people, symptoms began within a few days following receipt of the second dose of the 
Moderna COVID -19 Vaccine. The chance of having this occur i s very low. The vaccine recipients 
should seek medical attention right away if they have any of the following symptoms after 
receiving the Moderna COVID -19 Vaccine:  
• Chest pain  
• Shortness of breath  
• Feelings of having a fast -beating, fluttering, or pounding h eart 
Side effects that have been reported in a clinical trial with the Moderna COVID -19 Vaccine 
include:  
• Injection site reactions: pain, tenderness and swelling of the lymph nodes in the same 
arm of the injection, swelling (hardness), and redness

 CONFIDENTIAL  • General s ide effects: fatigue, headache, muscle pain, joint pain, chills, nausea and 
vomiting, fever and rash  
Side effects that have been reported during post -authorization use of the Moderna COVID -19 
Vaccine include:  
• Severe allergic reactions  
• Myocarditis (inflamma tion of the heart muscle)  
• Pericarditis (inflammation of the lining outside the heart)  
• Fainting in association with injection of the vaccine  
These may not be all the possible side effects of the Moderna COVID -19 Vaccine. Serious and 
unexpected side effects may occur. The Moderna COVID -19 Vaccine is still being studied in 
clinical trials.  
3.3.3.  Risk -Benefit for REGN10933+REGN10987 Administered With COVID -19 
Vaccines  
To date, REGN10933+REGN10987 has not been studied systematically in the clinical 
development progra m with respect to concomitant (or temporally proximal) administration with 
vaccines (COVID -19 or otherwise). There are currently no published data on the safety and 
efficacy of COVID -19 vaccines in persons who received monoclonal antibodies as part of 
COVI D-19 treatment. However, in a study of healthy adult subjects who received multiple SC 
doses of REGN10933+REGN10987 (R10933 -10987 -HV-2093), 54 subjects were noted (in 
blinded analysis) to have COVID -19 vaccination in close temporal proximity to study drug 
administration and thought to still be in therapeutic range for REGN10933+REGN10987. In this 
subset of subjects, no SAEs or hypersensitivity reactions were reported post vaccination. Similarly, 
study R10933 -10987 -COV -2069 (COV -2069) is a phase 3 randomized  placebo -controlled trial 
assessing the safety and efficacy of REGN10933+REGN10987 in preventing COVID -19 after 
high risk exposure. During this study, 99 subjects received COVID -19 vaccination with few 
reported AE and no SAEs or hypersensitivity reactions.  Although HV -2093 and COV -2069 were 
not systematically designed studies to assess vaccine -drug interaction, these results suggest that 
REGN10933+REGN10987 administered with a COVID -19 vaccine is reasonably expected to be 
well-tolerated in healthy adult sub jects.  
Little or no impact is anticipated on the safety profile of the REGN10933+REGN10987 
combination when COVID -19 vaccine is given concomitantly or in temporal proximity, although 
safety and tolerability will nevertheless be evaluated in this study. Similarly, this study will also 
evaluate if concomitant administration (or administration in temporal proximity) may impact 
efficacy of COVID -19 vaccines to induce the desired immunologic response (positively or 
negatively).  
All risks described in the sect ions above for individual treatments (Section  3.3.1  and Section  3.3.2 ) 
are considered relevant for the administration of REGN10933+REGN10987 and Moderna mRNA -
1273 vaccine concomitantly or in temporal proximity. Theoretically, there may be a potential for 
the REGN10933+REGN10987 combination to interf ere with an individual’s endogenous immune 
response to either SARS -CoV -2 infection or vaccination against COVID -19 in such setting. The 
objective of this study is to determine if this theoretical risk is identified and, if so, to quantify the 
                                        VV-RIM-00182647-1.0 Approved - 28 Jan 2022 GMT-5:00

 CONFIDENTIAL  risk. To miti gate the potential risk of such interference, an allowance is provided for subjects to 
receive additional vaccination if interference is identified (Section  6.1). Similarly, there could be 
risk of hypersensitivity reactions when REGN10933+REGN10987 is administered within close 
proximity of Moderna mRNA -1273 vaccine. In this study, the risk of hypersensitivity will be 
monitored closely during study visits . Theoretical risk of ADE also remains applicable. However, 
currently ADE has not come up as a safety concern for REGN10933+REGN10987 in the long -
term safety follow -up in the ongoing clinical studies. We will continue to monitor ADE as a 
theoretical risk i n this study like all other ongoing clinical studies.  
Summary. In summary, based on prior experience with other human mAbs against exogenous 
targets, the available preclinical data for REGN10933+REGN10987 to date, and the unmet need 
for a SARS -CoV -2 therap y that can be given concomitantly (or in temporal proximity) to COVID -
19 vaccination, it is the opinion of the Sponsor that the overall risk -benefit balance for 
REGN10933+REGN10987 given concomitantly with Moderna mRNA -1273 is acceptable to 
allow evaluatio n of this mAb combination in the adult population planned for this study.

 CONFIDENTIAL  6. STUDY DESIGN  
This study is a phase 2, randomized, open -label, parallel group study in healthy adult volunteers 
to assess the i mmunogenicity, safety, and tolerability of Moderna mRNA -1273 vaccine when 
administered with REGN10933+REGN10987.  
6.1. Study Description and Duration  
The study consists of 3 periods: a screening/baseline period, a vaccine response assessment period, 
and a follo w-up period. The study design is depicted in Figure  2 and Figure  3; study treatment 
assignment is depicted in Figure  1. The Schedules o f Events can be found in Table  3 (enrollment 
wave 1 [ study arms 1, 2, 3, and 6a] and enrollment wave 3 [arms 7, 8, and 6c]), Table  4 (enrollment 
wave 2 [ study arms 4, 5, and 6b] ), and Figure  3 (enrollment wave 4 [arms 9 and 6d]).  
Subjects will be assessed for eligibility during the screening/baseline period , which may occur 
up to 21  days prior to day 1. To be eligible for the study, subjects must be confirmed negative for 
current or past SARS -CoV -2 infection by both RT -PCR and serology tests (refer Section  7.2.2  for 
exclusio n criteria).  
During this  period, subjects will also be assigned to an enrollment wave, as described in 
Section  8.5).  
On day 1, eligible subjects wil l be randomized to a study arm (1 of 12) within their assigned 
enrollment wave. Subjects randomized to study arms 1 through 5 or 7 through 9 will receive an IV 
infusion or SC injection of the study drug ( REGN10933+REGN10987 ) on day 1 or day 7. Subjects 
in arms 6a to 6d (the control arms) will not receive any study drug. The first dose of the vaccine 
will be administered on day 1 or day 15, based on study arm assignment at randomization 
(Figure  1).  
All subjects will receive the second dose of the vaccine 28 days after their first dose of the vaccine 
in accordance with the EUA Fact Sheet (Moderna COVID -19 Vaccine [HCP Fact Sheet], 2022 ) 
(refer to Section  3.2.1  for rationale).  Refer to Section  8.5 for more information on dose levels and 
timing of administration.  
The vaccine response assessment period  represents the time period of the primary analysis 
(Section  4.1). For study arms 1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 6a, and 6c, this period includes up to study day 71; for 
study arms 4, 5, 9, 6b, and 6d, the period includes up to day 57. Following this assessment period, 
subjects will enter a follow -up period  lasting up to 10 months.  
Throughout the study, blood samples  will be collected to assess whether the study drug impacts 
the ability of the vaccine to elicit neutralizing antibody titers against the SARS -CoV -2 S protein, 
and to understand any impact on vaccine -induced humoral and cellular immune responses to 
various  S protein epitopes. Additional details are provided in Section  9.2.3 . 
Subjects will also have blood samples taken at select visits for drug concentra tion, 
immunogenicity, and exploratory analyses, and will be monitored for AEs (including AESIs)  
during in -person visits (refer to Section  10.1 for reco rding and reporting requirements). For 
subjects in study arms 4 and 5 (receiving the study drug and vaccine on the same day), a phone 
call will be made within 24 hours following study drug and vaccine administration on day 1 for 
AE collection.

 CONFIDENTIAL  6.1.1.  Risk Minimization for SARS -CoV -2 Infection and Transmission  
To minimize the risk of acquiring or transmitting SARS -CoV -2 infection during the study, subjects 
will be asked to comply with all precautionary measures related to C OVID -19 stipulated within 
site policies and local public health guidelines or requirements.  
Subjects will be provided with contact information for the clinical study site and will be given 
written and verbal instructions to call site personnel with any ch anges in their health status. They 
will be asked to promptly notify site personnel by phone of any positive SARS -CoV -2 testing 
results or symptoms/signs potentially related to COVID -19. Subjects presenting with acute illness 
should be medically managed acc ording to local standard of care and per the discretion of the 
treating physician. Refer to Section  8.3.3  for additional guidance concerning COVID -19 vaccine 
deferral or discontinuation.  
Subjects with laboratory confirmed SARS -CoV -2 infection should be informed as soon as 
possible, and should undergo medical isolation per local guidelines and CDC guidance on medical 
isolation  (CDC, 2021 ) , to prevent contact with others and reduce the risk of further transmission.  
6.1.2.  Sample Collection and Visit Scheduling for Subjects with Suspected COVID -19 
Symptoms or Positive SARS -CoV -2 Test  
For subjects with signs or symptoms consistent with COVID -19, or those who obtain a positive 
SARS -CoV -2 RT -PCR test result from another testing locati on, every effort should be made to 
obtain a sample for SARS -CoV -2 rapid RT -PCR testing as soon as possible, either during an 
unscheduled visit or during a planned schedule visit (whichever is sooner). All subjects with 
suspected COVID -19 or laboratory -confirmed SARS -CoV -2 infection will continue to follow their 
respective Schedule of Events (Section 9.1), as feasible according to local guidelines, site policies, 
and/or CDC guidance on medical isolation  (CDC, 2021 ) . Every effort s hould be made to obtain 
subsequent rapid RT -PCR testing samples as indicated in the Schedule of Events as feasible 
according to local guidelines, site policies, and/or CDC guidance on medical isolation  
(CDC,  2021 ) . Every effort should be made to obtain subsequent rapid RT -PCR testing samples as 
indicated in the Schedule of Events. T hese samples will be banked for viral sequencing.  
6.1.3.  Study Stopping Rules  
A Regeneron team will monitor the safety data on an ongoing basis to assess the risk -benefit profile 
of REGN10933+REGN10987 administered with Moderna mRNA -1273 vaccine . The team may 
be comprised of the medical/study director, a Global Patient Safety representative, representatives 
from Biostatistics and Data Management, Clinical Operations, and Regulatory Affairs.  
The monitoring team will also include at least 2 medical officers from the National Institutes of 
Health (NIH). One officer will serve as the primary representative, with a second officer serving 
as an alternate representative as needed.  
If there are significant safety concerns, a recommendation may be made to temporarily pau se, alter, 
or terminate the study. Appropriate action, if needed, will be taken based upon this review and in 
consultation with Regeneron Safety Oversight Committee (RSOC) , which will include senior 
clinical, regulatory, and pharmacovigilance leaders at Re generon. Applicable regulatory 
procedures will be adhered to as required by local laws in relation to any decisions related to a 
change in study conduct, temporary halt, study termination, or study restart.

23. Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP)1 who are unwilling to practice highly effective 
contraception prior to the initial dose/start of the first treatment and for at least 6 months 
after REGN10933+REGN10987 administration  
Highly effective contraceptive measures include:  
• Abstinence2,3 
• Stable use of combined (estrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception 
(oral, intravaginal, transdermal) or progestogen -only hormonal contraception (oral, 
injectable, implantable) associated with inhibition of ovulation initiated 2 or more 
menstrual cycles prior to screening  
• Intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine hormone -releasing system (IUS)  
• Bilateral tubal ligation  
1WOCBP are defined as women who are fertile following menarche until becoming 
postmenopausal, unless permanently sterile. Per manent sterilization methods include 
hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy, and bilateral oophorectomy.  
A postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 months without an alternative 
medical cause. A high follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level in th e postmenopausal 
range may be used to confirm a postmenopausal state in women not using hormonal 
contraception or hormonal replacement therapy. However, in the absence of 12  months of 
amenorrhea, a single FSH measurement is insufficient to determine the oc currence of a 
postmenopausal state. The above definitions are according to the Clinical Trial Facilitation 
Group (CTFG) guidance. Pregnancy testing and contraception are not required for women 
with documented hysterectomy or tubal ligation.  
2Sexual abstine nce is considered a highly effective method only if defined as refraining 
from heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the study 
drugs. The reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the duration  
of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient.

 CONFIDENTIAL  3Periodic abstinence (calendar, symptothermal, post -ovulation methods), withdrawal 
(coitus interruptus), spermicides only, and lactational amenorrhoea method (LAM) are not 
accepta ble methods of contraception. Female condom and male condom should not be used 
together.  
24. Sexually active men who are unwilling to use the following forms of medically 
acceptable birth control during the study drug follow -up period and for 6 months after 
REGN10933+REGN10987 administration: vasectomy with medical assessment of 
surgical success OR consistent use of a condom. Sperm donation is prohibited during the 
study and for up to 6 months after REGN10933+REGN10987 administration.  
25. Clinical history of myoc arditis and/or pericarditis . 
7.3. Premature Withdrawal from the Study  
A subject has the right to withdraw from the study at any time, for any reason, and without 
repercussion.  
The investigator and/or Sponsor have the right to withdraw a subject from the study if it is no 
longer in the interest of the subject to continue in the study, or if the subject’s continuation in the 
study places the scientific outcome of the study at risk (eg, if a subject does not or cannot follow 
study procedures). An excessive rate of  withdrawals would render the study uninterpretable; 
therefore, unnecessary withdrawal of subjects should be avoided.  
Subjects who are withdrawn prematurely from the study will be asked to complete the early 
termination visit, as described in Section  9.1.2 . 
Rules for discontinuation of study drug or vaccine are discussed in Section  8.3.

Local injection site reactions must be reported as AEs and graded according to S ection  10.2.4 . 
8.4.3.  Acute Injection Reactions to the Vaccine  
Appropriate medical treatment to manage immediate allergic reactions must be immediately 
avail able in the event an acute anaphylactic reaction occurs following administration of the 
vaccine. Always refer to the latest EUA Fact Sheet (Moderna COVID -19 Vaccine [HCP Fact 
Sheet], 2022 ) for additional information.  
8.5. Method of Enrollment and Treatment Assignment  
Site-managed assignment. At screening, eligible subjects will be assigned to an  enrollment wave. 
The enrollment waves are intended to avoid or minimize the potential for unused doses of Moderna 
mRNA -1273 COVID -19 vaccine (refer to Section  3.2.1  for additional rationale). Every effort 
should be made by sites to avoid unused doses of vaccine.  
Sites will manage the placement of subjects into each wave. Every effort should be made by the  
site to ensure balance of age (<65 years and ≥65 years) within each of the enrollment waves.  
Randomization. At baseline (day 1), subjects will be randomized to the corresponding study arms 
in each wave as described in Table  2.  
Randomization will be performed  according to a computer -generated randomization scheme 
provided by an interactive web response system (IWRS) to a designated study pharmacist or a 
qualified designee.  
Randomization will be stratified by age (<65 years versus ≥65 years).

 CONFIDENTIAL  9.1.1.  Footnotes for the Schedules of Events  
1. Throughout the study, study drug and/or vaccine administration will occur after all samples 
have been collected and all assessments have been performed.  
2. Separate consent is required for participation in the optional va ccine booster sub -study 
(Section  9.2.10 ), optional future biomedical research sub -study (Section  9.2.8 ), and 
optional pharmacogenomics sub -study (Section  9.2.9 ). For subjects consenting to the 
genomics sub -study, the blood sample for genomic DNA should be collected at baseline 
(day 1) but may be collected at any visit.  
3. All women of childbearing potential (WOCBP), with the exception of women with 
documented bilateral tubal ligation, will require pre gnancy testing at screening, prior to 
study drug administration, and prior to COVID -19 vaccine administration. If a urine 
pregnancy test result is positive, a serum pregnancy test will be performed for confirmation. 
Subjects with confirmed pregnancy (by se rum test) at screening will not be randomized. If 
the screening visit occurs on the same day as the baseline visit on day 1, pregnancy testing 
does not need to be repeated. Subjects with  confirmed pregnancy at post -baseline dosing 
visits will be counseled according to Section  8.3.3 . 
4. If the screening visit occurs on the same day as the baseline visit on day 1, SARS -CoV -2- 
rapid RT -PCR test does not need to be repeated. Nasopharyngeal swabs will be used for 
rapid RT -PCR testing. Refer to Section  6.1.2  for more information on sample collection 
and visit scheduling for subjects with suspected COVID -19 or positive RT -PCR test result.

first dose of the vaccine; day 71  for study arms 1, 2, 3, 6a, 7, 8, and 6c, and day 57  for study arms 
4, 5, 6b, 9, and 6d) will be asked to return to the clinic once for an early termination (ET) visit  
consisting of the end of study assessments (as described in the respective Schedules of Events).  
9.1.3.  Unscheduled Visits  
All attempts should be made to keep subje cts on the study schedule. Unscheduled visits may be 
necessary to repeat testing following abnormal laboratory results, for follow -up of AEs, or for any 
other reason, as warranted.  
9.2. Study Procedures  
9.2.1.  Procedures Performed at the Screening/Baseline Visit  
Proce dures to be performed for the purpose of determining study eligibility or characterizing the 
baseline population include: medical history, demographics (including age, sex, race, weight, 
height), and SARS -CoV -2 RT -PCR and serology tests.  
9.2.1.1.  Informed Consent  
Informed consent must be obtained according to the requirements described in Section  13.2. 
Additional informed consent must be obtained if subjects choose to participate in the optional 
vaccine booster sub -study (Section  9.2.10 ), optional f uture biomedical research sub -study (refer 
to Section  9.2.8 ), or optional pharmacogenomics sub -study (refer to Section  9.2.9 ). 
9.2.1.2.  SARS -CoV -2 Rapid RT -PCR  
At screening, the investigator or designee will verify that the subject has tested negative for 
SARS -CoV -2 by a rapid RT -PCR test. Historical test re sults will not be accepted.  
Subjects will also be tested for SARS -CoV -2 infection by the rapid RT -PCR test using 
nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs throughout the study according to the respective Schedules of Events.

 CONFIDENTIAL  SC and IM Injection Administration  
All subjects allocated to a SC regimen will receive either  4 (study arm 4) or 2 (study arm 5) 
injections of study drug on the day of administration. It is recommended that SC injection sites 
should be chosen among the different quadrants of the abdomen (avoiding navel and waist areas) 
and upper thighs. During stu dy drug administration, each injection must be given in a different 
anatomical location (1 injection administered in the right lower quadrant of the abdomen, another 
in the left lower quadrant of the abdomen, etc).  
All subjects will receive each Moderna m RNA -1273 vaccination dose through a single IM 
injection in the deltoid muscle  (CDC, 2021 ) . 
Subjects should receive all doses of Moderna mRNA -1273 vaccine as  assigned and as described 
in the EUA Fact Sheet (Moderna COVID -19 Vaccine [HCP Fact Sheet ], 2022 ). 
Study arms 4 and 5 only:  Subjects will receive both study drug and vaccine on day 1. The study 
drug will be administered first, followed by the vaccine. There must be a minimum of 2 hours 
waiting period between administration of the study drug  and subsequent vaccine. Administration 
of the individual regimens should be performed as described above.  
Post-administration monitoring of study drug and vaccine  
Study arms 1 through 5 and 7 through 9:  Subjects should be monitored for at least 1 hour af ter 
study drug or vaccine administration. Vaccine recipients should be monitored for the occurrence 
of acute reactions according to the latest CDC guidelines  (CDC, 2021 ) . For study arms 4 and 5 
(receiving study drug and vaccine on the s ame day), approximately 24 hours after completion of 
the study drug and vaccine administration on day 1, subjects will be followed up by telephone for 
safety.  
Study arms 6a, 6b, 6c and 6d:  Subjects assigned to each of these study arms will not receive 
study drug during this study. These subjects should be monitored for at least 30 minutes after 
vaccine administration . 
9.2.3.  Pharmacodynamic and Exploratory Biomarker Procedures  
This section describes planned or potential pharmacodynamic and exploratory analyses, some of 
which may not be reported in the CSR.  
Note that any biological samples collected during the study which are not used for their planned 
purpose, or for which material remains after their planned analysis, may be kept for up 15 years 
after study comp letion (or for a shorter time period if required per regional laws and regulations) 
for use in exploratory research related to how the study drugs work and to study SARS -CoV -2, 
COVID -19, and immune responses to SARS -CoV -2 vaccination.  
9.2.3.1.  SARS -CoV -2 Neutraliza tion Assays  
Vaccine induced neutralizing antibody titers will be characterized using an assay to measure the 
ability of serum antibodies to block SARS -CoV -2 S protein -mediated infection of cells in vitro. 
(Vandergaast, 2020 ). Because REGN10933+REGN10987 will neutralize infection in this assay, 
anti-idiotype antibodies that block REGN10933 and REGN10987 neutralizing activity will be 
added, allowing for detection of  vaccine -induced neutralizing antibodies generated in vivo 
post-vaccination. The ID 50 (serum dilution that inhibits by 50% the transfection signal detected in

 CONFIDENTIAL  positive control wells) of neutralizing antibodies tested will be compared between the vaccine -only 
arm and each REGN10933+REGN10987 treatment group at time points in the Schedules of Events 
to measure the induction of neutralizing activity to the SARS -CoV -2 S protein.  
9.2.3.2.  SARS -CoV -2 Serology Characterization Assays  
Serum binding antibodies to SARS -CoV -2 S protein trimer, RBD and other SARS -CoV -2 
subdomains (including S1 and nucleocapsid) will be assessed as secondary and exploratory 
objectives of this study. To explore whether or not mRNA -1273 vaccine -mediated humoral 
immunity to SARS -CoV -2 is affected by the administration of REGN10933+REGN10987, 
serological immunoassays will be used to detect antibodies against the SARS -CoV -2 S protein and 
subdomains at time points in the Schedules of Events . Because REGN10933+REGN10987 will 
interfere with these measur ements, an anti -idiotype antibody that blocks 
REGN10933+REGN10987 will be included in the assay, allowing for detection of endogenous 
serum antibodies generated in vivo post -vaccination. Additional serological characterization 
related to antibody recogniti on of viral variants and further delineation of the epitope repertoire of 
vaccine -induced antibodies may be done if technically feasible and assays become available.  
9.2.3.3.  Cellular Immunity Assays  
PBMCs will be processed at a central lab and may be stored for analysis. Both B cell and T cell 
immune responses will be studied. Assays for B cell responses may include, but not be limited to, 
quantification by flow -cytometry of circulating antigen -specific B cells or plasma cells using 
labeled S protein trimer, RBD and other SARS -CoV -2 subdomains, and quantification of SARS -
CoV -2 specific antibody responses in either primary ELISPOT assays or re -stimulation assays 
followed by ELISPOT. Studies focused on T cell responses may include, but may not be limited 
to, flow cy tometry with isolated PBMCs to characterize immune subsets, quantify SARS -CoV -2 
specific T cell responses via ex vivo peptide stimulation assays with downstream flow cytometry 
and/or cytokine measurements. Cell profiling may include bulk RNA (transcriptome ) sequencing, 
and T cell receptor or B cell receptor RNA or DNA sequencing.  
9.2.3.4.  Viral Sequencing  
In order to monitor for possible SARS -CoV -2 infection post -REGN10933+REGN10987 treatment 
and/or post -vaccination and potential resistance, NP swabs will be collect ed for SARS -CoV -2 RT -
PCR testing at timepoints designated in the Schedules of Events. Viral genome sequencing will be 
performed on available post -baseline viral nucleic acid samples with a positive RT -PCR test result. 
Sequencing analyses will consist of th e entire viral genome, including the full gene sequence that 
encodes the SARS -CoV -2 S protein.  
Viral variants suspected to confer decreased susceptibility to REGN10933 and/or REGN10987 or 
the mRNA -1273 vaccine will be evaluated in nonclinical work separate  from this protocol.  
The results of viral sequencing will be reported separately from the CSR . 
9.2.3.5.  Serum and Plasma for Exploratory Research  
Changes in circulating concentrations of serum/plasma biomarkers associated with COVID -19, 
SARS -CoV -2, REGN10933+REGN10 987, vaccine -induced immunity, vaccine -drug interactions, 
host and viral biological pathways, and other mechanisms related to disease activity and clinical

All laboratory values must be reviewed by the investigator or authorize d designee.  
Significantly abnormal test results that occur after start of treatment must be repeated to confirm 
the nature and degree of the abnormality. When necessary, appropriate ancillary investigations 
should be initiated. If the abnormality fails to resolve or cannot be explained by events or 
conditions unrelated to the study medication or its administration, the Medical/Study Director must 
be consulted.  
The clinical significance of an abnormal test value, within the context of the disease under stud y, 
must be determined by the investigator.  
Criteria for reporting laboratory values as an AE are provided in Section  10.1.

9.2.8.  Future Biomedical Research (Optional)  
Subjects who agree to participate in the future biomedical research (FBR) sub -study will be 
required to consent to this optional sub -study before samples are banked for FBR. Residual 
bioma rker samples for study -related research, as well as unused PK and ADA samples, will be 
stored for up to 15 years after the final date of the database lock (or for a shorter time period if 
required per regional laws and regulations). The samples may be utilized for FBR that may or may 
not be directly related to the study, including being used as reference samples and assay 
development or validation. The results of these future biomedical research analyses will not be 
presented in the CSR.  
9.2.9.  Pharmacogenomic Analysis (Optional)  
Subjects who agree to participate in the genomics sub -study will be required to consent to this 
optional sub -study before collection of the samples. Whole blood samples for DNA extraction 
should be collected on day 1/bas eline (predose), but can be collected at a later study visit. DNA 
samples will be collected for pharmacogenomics analyses to understand the genetic determinants 
of efficacy and safety associated with the treatments in this study and the molecular basis of 
COVID -19 and related diseases. These samples will be single -coded as defined by the 
International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) guideline E15. Samples will be stored for up to 15 
years after the final date of the database lock (or for a shorter time peri od if required per regional 
laws and regulations). If there are specific site or country requirements involving the 
pharmacogenomic analyses which the Sponsor is unable to comply with, samples will not be 
collected at those sites.  
The purpose of the pharm acogenomic analyses is to identify genomic associations with clinical or 
biomarker response to REGN10933+REGN10987, SARS -CoV -2 vaccination, other COVID -19 
clinical outcome measures and possible AEs. In addition, associations between genomic variants 
and pr ognosis or progression of COVID -19 as well as related diseases may also be studied.  These 
data may be used or combined with data collected from other studies to identify and validate 
genomic markers related to the study drug, target pathway, SARS -CoV -2 vac cination or 
COVID -19.  
Analyses may include sequence determination or single nucleotide polymorphism studies of 
candidate genes and surrounding genomic regions. Other methods, including whole -exome 
sequencing, whole -genome sequencing, and DNA copy number v ariation may also be performed. 
The list of methods may be expanded to include novel methodology that may be developed during 
the course of this study or sample storage period. Results from the genomic analyses will not be 
reported in the CSR.

10. SAFETY EVALUATION AN D REPORTING  
10.1. Recording and Reporting Adverse Events  
10.1.1.  General Guidelines  
In this study, the following  TEAEs will be recorded:  
• Treatment -emergent AEs throughout the study  
• Treatment -emergent SAEs throughout the study  
• Treatment -emergent AESIs (defined in Section  10.1.3 )  
The investigator must promptly record all clinical events occurring during the study data 
collection , from the time of signing the ICF to the end of the post-vaccination observation period 
(see Section  11.4.6.1 ). Medical conditions that existed or were diagnosed prior to the signing of 
the Informed Consent will be recorded as part of medical history. Abnormal laboratory values and 
vital signs observed at  the time of Informed Consent should also be recorded as medical history. 
Any subsequent worsening (ie, any clinically significant change in frequency and/or intensity) of 
a pre -existing condition that is temporally associated with the use of the study dru g should also be 
recorded as an AE.  
At each visit, the investigator will determine whether any AEs have occurred by evaluating the 
subject. Adverse events may be directly observed, reported spontaneously by the subject, or by 
questioning the subject at eac h study visit. Subjects should be questioned in a general way, without 
asking about the occurrence of any specific symptoms. The investigator must assess all AEs to 
determine seriousness, severity, and causality, in accordance with the definitions in Secti on 10.1.4 . 
The investigator’s assessment must be clearly documented in the site’s source documentation with 
the investigator’s signature. The investig ator should follow up on SAEs (and AESIs) until they 
have resolved or are considered clinically stable; AEs should be followed until they are resolved 
or last study visit, whichever comes first.  
Always report the diagnosis as the AE or SAE term. When a dia gnosis is unavailable, report the 
primary sign or symptom as the AE or SAE term with additional details included in the narrative 
until the diagnosis becomes available. If the signs and symptoms are distinct and do not suggest a 
common diagnosis, report th em as individual entries of AE or SAE.  
Laboratory results, vital signs, and other diagnostic result s or findings  should be appraised by the 
investigator to determine their clinical significance.  Isolated abnormal laboratory results, vital sign 
findings, o r other diagnostic findings (ie, not part of a reported diagnosis) should be reported as 
                                        VV-RIM-00182647-1.0 Approved - 28 Jan 2022 GMT-5:00

Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc .  Page 68 
 CONFIDENTIAL  AEs if they are symptomatic, lead to study drug discontinuation,  require corrective treatment, or 
constitute an AE in the investigator ’s clinical judgment . 
For events that are serious due to hospitalization, the reason for hospitalization must be reported 
as the serious adverse event (diagnosis or symptom requiring hospitalization). A procedure is not 
an AE or SAE, but the reason for the procedure may be an AE or SAE. P re-planned (prior to 
signing the informed consent form) procedure s, treatment s requiring hospitalization for pre -
existing conditions that do not worsen in severity, and admission for palliative or social care should 
not be reported as SAEs (see Section  10.1.4  for definitions).  
For deaths, the underlying or immediate cause of death should always be reported as an SAE.  
Any SAE that may occur subsequent to the reporting period that the investigator assesses as related 
to study drug should also be reported.  
All AEs, SAEs , AESIs, and pregnancy reports are to be reported according to the procedures in 
Section  10.1.3 .  
10.1.2.  Reporting Procedure  
All events (serious and non -serious) must be reported with investigator’s assessment of the event’s 
seriousness, severity, and causality to the study drug. For SAEs and AESIs, a detailed narrative 
summarizing the course of the event, including its evaluation, treatment, and outcome should be 
provided on the AE CRF. Specific or estimated dates of event onset, treatment, and resolution 
should be included, when available. Me dical history, concomitant medications, and laboratory data 
that are relevant to the event should also be summarized in the narrative. For fatal events, the 
narrative should state whether an autopsy was or will be performed, and include the results if 
available. Information not available at the time of the initial report must be documented in a follow -
up report. Source documents  (including hospital or medical re cords, diagnostic reports, etc. ) will 
be summarized in the narrative on the AE CRF, and retained at the  study center and available upon 
request.  
Urgent safety queries must be followed up and addressed promptly. Follow -up information and 
response to non -urgent safety queries should be combined for reporting to provide the most 
complete data possible w ithin each follow -up.  
10.1.3.  Events that Require Expedited Reporting to Sponsor

 CONFIDENTIAL  • If subjects experience Grade ≥ 3 ISRs or Grade ≥2 hypersensitivity reactions related to 
Moderna mRNA -1273 administered as a concomitant medication outside of the 
study , these events are NOT to be considered as AESIs and do not require expedited 
reporting to Sponsor  
• Pregnancy:  Although pregnancy is not considered an AE, it is the responsibility of the 
investigator to report to the Sponsor (or designee), within 24  hours of identification, 
any pregnancy occurring in a female, for 6 months after REGN10933+REGN10987 
administration. Any complication of pregnancy affecting a female study subject and/or 
fetus and/or newborn that mee ts the SAE criteria must be reported as an SAE. Outcome 
for all pregnancies should be reported to the Sponsor . 
10.1.4.  Reporting Adverse Events Following Vaccination  
It is advised that healthcare providers administering Moderna mRNA -1273 vaccine should 
comply with  CDC requirements for AE reporting, as outlined in the EUA Fact Sheet (Moderna 
COVID -19 Va ccine [HCP Fact Sheet], 2022 ). 
The vaccination provider is responsible for mandatory reporting of the following to the 
Vaccine  Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS):  
• Vacci ne administration errors whether or not associated with an adverse event,  
• Serious  adverse events* (irrespective of attribution to vaccination),  
• Cases of Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome (MIS) in adults, and  
• Cases of COVID -19 that result in hospitalization or death.  
*Serious adverse events are defined as: Death; A life -threatening adve rse event; Inpatient 
hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; A persistent or significant incapacity or 
substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions; A congenital anomaly/birth 
defect; An important medical even t that based on appropriate medical judgement may jeopardize the 
individual and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed 
above.  
10.2. Definitions  
10.2.1.  Adverse Event  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject admin istered a study drug which may or 
may not have a causal relationship with the study drug. Therefore, an AE is any unfavorable and 
unintended sign (including abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease which is temporally 
associated with the use of a study drug, whether or not considered related to the study drug (ICH 
E2A Guideline. Clinical Safety Data Management: Definitions and Standards for Expedited 
Reporting, Oct 1994).  
10.2.2.  Serious Adverse Event  
An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any d ose:

Clinical Study Protocol   R10933 -10987 -COV -2118 Amendment 5  
 
Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc .  Page 70 
 CONFIDENTIAL  • Results in death  – includes all deaths, even those that appear to be completely unrelated 
to study drug (eg, a car accident in which a subject is a passenger).  
• Is life-threatening  – in the view of the investigator, the subject is at immediate risk of 
death at the time of the event. This does not include an AE that had it occurred in a 
more severe form, might have caused death.  
• Requires in -patient hospitalization  or prolongation of existing hospitalization . 
In-patient hospitalization is defined as a hos pital admission (any duration) or an 
emergency room visit for longer than 24 hours. Prolongation of existing hospitalization 
is defined as a hospital stay that is longer than was originally anticipated for the event, 
or is prolonged due to the development of a new AE as determined by the investigator 
or treating physician.  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  (substantial disruption of 
one’s ability to conduct normal life functions).  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• Is an importan t medical event - Important medical events may not be immediately 
life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization, but may jeopardize the subject or 
may require intervention to prevent one of the other serious outcomes listed above (eg, 
intensive tr eatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood 
dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization; or development of drug 
dependency or drug abuse).  
Criteria for reporting SAEs must be followed for these events.  
10.2.3.  Adverse Events of Special Interest  
An adverse event of special interest (AESI; serious or non -serious) is one of scientific and medical 
interest specific to the Sponsor’s product or program, for which ongoing monitoring and rapid 
communication by the inves tigator to the Sponsor can be appropriate. Such an event might warrant 
further investigation in order to characterize and understand it.  
AESI are defined for this study in Section  10.1.3 . 
10.2.4.  Severity  
The severity of adverse events (including test findings classified as AEs) will be graded using the 
current version of the NCI -CTCAE v5.0.  
Treatment -emergent AEs, SAEs, or AESIs not listed in the NCI -CTCAE w ill be graded according 
to the scale in Table  7. The grading systems for anaphylaxis, allergic reaction (hypersensitivity), 
infusion -related reaction, and  injection -site reaction are provided in Table  8.

 CONFIDENTIAL  10.2.5.  Causality  
The investigator must provide causality assessment as whether or not there is a reasonable 
possibility that the study drug and/or vaccine administered as part of the study caused the AE, 
based on evidence or facts, his/her clinical judgment, and the follow ing definitions. Causality 
should be assessed separately for the study drug and for the vaccine. The causality assessment 
must  be made based on the available information and can be updated as new information becomes 
available.  
The following factors should be considered when assessing causality:  
• Temporal relationship: time to onset vs time study drug and/or vaccine was 
administered  
• Nature of the reactions: immediate vs long term  
• Clinical and pathological features of the events  
• Existing information about study drug and/or vaccine and the same class of drugs or 
vaccines  
• Concomitant medications  
• Underlying and concurrent illnesses  
• Response to dechallenge (drug discontinuation) or dose reduction  
• Response to rechallenge (re -introduction of the drug) or dose increase, when applicable  
• Subject’s medical and social history  
Causality to the study drug and/or vaccine (including study drug and/or vaccine administration):  
• Related:  
− The AE follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the study drug and/or vaccine 
admi nistered as part of the study , and cannot be reasonably explained by the nature 
of the reaction, subject’s clinical state (eg, disease under study, concurrent diseases, 
concomitant medications), or other external factors.  
or 
− The AE follows a reasonable tem poral sequence from the study drug and/or vaccine 
administ ered as part of the study , and is a known reaction to the drug or vaccine 
under study or its classes, or is predicted by known pharmacology.  
• Not Related:  
− The AE does not follow a reasonable sequence  from the study drug and/or vaccine  
administ ered as part of the study , or can be reasonably explained by the nature of 
the reaction, subject's clinical state (eg, disease under study, concurrent diseases, 
and concomitant medications) or other external factors.

 CONFIDENTIAL  Causality to the study conduct (protocol specified procedure):  
• Related:  
− The AE follows a reasonable temporal sequence from a protocol specified 
procedure, and cannot be reasonably explained by the nature of the reaction, 
subject's clinical state ( eg, disease under study, concurrent diseases, concomitant 
medications), or other external factors.  
• Not Related:  
− The AE does not follow a reasonable sequence from a protocol specified procedure, 
or can be reasonably explained by the nature of the reaction, subject's clinical state 
(eg, disease under study, concurrent diseases, and concomitant medications) or 
other external factors.  
10.3. Safety Monitoring  
The investigator will monitor the safety of study subject at his/her site(s) as per the requirements 
of this p rotocol and consistent with current Good Clinical Practice (GCP). Any questions or 
concerns should be discussed with the Sponsor in a timely fashion. The Sponsor will monitor the 
safety data from across all study sites. The Medical/Study Director will have  primary responsibility 
for the emerging safety profile of the compound, but will be supported by other departments (eg, 
GPS; Biostatistics and Data Management). Safety monitoring will be performed on an ongoing 
basis (eg, individual review of SAEs) and on  a periodic cumulative aggregate basis.  
10.4. Notifying Health Authorities, Institutional Review Board, and 
Investigators  
During the study, the Sponsor and/or the contract research organization (CRO) will inform health 
authorities, IRBs, and the participating investigators of any SUSARs (Suspected Unexpected 
Serious Adverse Reactions) occurring in other study centers or other  studies of the active study 
drug REGN10933+REGN10987 , as appropriate per local reporting requirements. In addition, the 
Sponsor and/or CRO will comply with any additional local safety reporting requirements. All 
notifications to investigators will contain  only blinded information.   
Upon receipt of the Sponsor’s notification of a SUSAR that occurred with the study drug, the 
investigator will inform the Institutional Review Board (IRB) unless delegated to the Sponsor.  
Event expectedness for study drug REGN10 933+REGN10987 is assessed against the Reference 
Safety Information section of the Investigator’s Brochure that is effective for expedited safety 
reporting.  
At the completion of the study, the Sponsor will report all safety observations made during the 
cond uct of the trial in the Clinical Study Report to health authorities and IRB as appropriate.

 CONFIDENTIAL  11. STATISTICAL PLAN  
This section provides the basis for the statistical analysis plan (SAP) for the study. The SAP will 
be revised prior to the end of the study to acc ommodate amendments to the clinical study protocol 
and to make changes to adapt to unexpected issues in study execution and data that may affect the 
planned analyses. The final SAP will be issued before the first database lock.  
Endpoints are listed in Sect ion 4. Analysis variables are listed in Section  5.  
11.1. Statistical Hypothesis  
No statistical hypothesis testing is planned in this study. Analyses of immunogenicity, safety, 
tolerability, and other data will be descriptive and exploratory in n ature.  
11.2. Justification of Sample Size  
This study plans to enroll up to approximately 286 subjects, in order to achieve a target enrollment 
of up to approximately 30 subjects per Moderna mRNA -1273 + (REGN10933 and REGN10987) 
arm and 46 total Moderna mRNA -1273 -alone subjects. Based on the calculations provided below, 
this sample size is considered appropriate to meet the aims of this phase 2 study, in that it is 
expected to provide adequate precision in quantifying the magnitude of effect for the primary 
endpoi nt, as well as allow for an assessment of the safety and tolerability of the Moderna mRNA -
1273 vaccine when administered with REGN10933+REGN10987.  
The assumed log 10-scale standard deviation for the study is 0.30 log. This assumption is based on 
phase 1 dat a for the Moderna mRNA -1273 vaccine, taking the weighted average (ie, adjusting for 
sample sizes) across all doses (25,100, and 250 μg) and age groups (18 to 55, 56 to 70, and ≥71 
years) for the neutralizing antibody titer ID 50 endpoint at day 57 (Anderson, 2020 ) (Jackson, 2020 ). 
With a log -scale standard deviation of 0.30 for the primary endpoint and a sample  size of 30 and 
46 subjects per arm (in combined study drug/vaccine and vaccine -only arms, respectively), the 
half-width of the 95% within -group confidence interval (CI) [ie, the minimal detectable difference] 
in this study is 0.11 log and 0.09 log, respec tively. For between -group comparisons, the half -width 
of the 95% between -group CI for any two Moderna mRNA -1273 + (REGN10933 and 
REGN10987) arms is 0.15 log. Additionally, the half -width of the 95% between -group CI in this 
study for any individual Moderna mRNA -1273 + (REGN10933 and REGN10987) arm and the 
total Moderna mRNA -1273 alone subjects is 0.14 log.  
The analysis set that will be used for assessment of vaccine response allows for subjects to be 
excluded from analysis if certain confounding criteria are  met (see Section  11.3.1 ). If 50% of 
subjects are excluded from analysis (ie, 15 subjects are analyzed per individual Moderna mRNA -
1273 + (REGN10933 an d REGN10987) arm and 23 total Moderna mRNA -1273 alone subjects 
are analyzed), the half -width of the 95% between group CI for any two Moderna mRNA -1273 + 
(REGN10933 and REGN10987) arms is 0.22 log. Additionally, the half -width of the 95% between 
group CI fo r any individual Moderna mRNA -1273 + (REGN10933 and REGN10987) arm and 
Moderna mRNA -1273 alone subjects is 0.20 log. Under this scenario, the minimal detectable 
difference still remains substantially smaller than the decrease in neutralization titers obser ved in 
a separate study of sera from recipients of the Moderna mRNA -1273 vaccine who were infected 
with South African variants (eg, B.1.351 v1, v2, and v3)  (Garcia -Beltran, 2021 )

11.4.3.  Analysis of Primary Vaccine Response Endpoint  
The primary endpoint is the 50% inhibitory dilution (ID 50) titers of vaccine -induced neutralizing 
antibodies to SARS -CoV -2 pseudovirus, assessed on 56 days after the first dose of the vaccine (ie, 
the vaccine response assessment period). The 56 -day time point  corresponds to study day 71 for 
study arms 1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 6a, and 6c, and study day 57 for study arms 4, 5, 9, 6b, and 6d.  
An analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with treatment group as a fixed effect and age as a 
covariate will be fit to the data as the primary analysis.  
The least squares mean estimates for the endpoint will be presented for each treatment group, as 
well a s for the differences between treatment groups. Associated 95% confidence intervals will 
also be reported for each treatment group and for between -group comparisons.  
Data will be fitted in the log scale, and final outputs will be reported in geometric mea ns and 
differences of the geometric means.

Risk-Based Quality Monitoring (RBQM) methodology focuses on employing a fi t-for-purpose 
monitoring strategy, supported either directly by Regeneron as Sponsor, or via our CRO partners. 
RBQM strategies include: reduced source data verification (SDV), targeted source data review 
(SDR), the use of off -site/remote and triggered on -site monitoring visits, and Centralized 
Monitoring to identify site level risks and study level trends. The investigator must allow study -
related monitoring activities to occur.  
The study monitors will perform ongoing source data review to verify that data recorded in the 
CRF by authorized site personnel are accurate, complete, and verifiable from source documents, 
that the safety and rights of subjects are being protected, and that the study is being conducted in 
accordance with the current approved protoco l version and any other study agreements, ICH GCP, 
and all applicable regulatory requirements.  
12.2.2.  Source Document Requirements  
Investigators are required to prepare and maintain adequate and accurate subject records (source 
documents). The site is responsible  to ensure quality within their records and systems and are 
accountable for ensuring that all source data and CRF data are timely, accurate and complete.  
The investigator must keep all source documents on file with the CRF (throughout this protocol, 
CRF re fers to either a paper CRF or an electronic CRF). Case report forms and source documents 
must be available at all times for inspection by authorized representatives of the Sponsor and 
regulatory authorities.

13. ETHICAL AND REGULATO RY CONSIDERATIONS   
13.1. Good Clinical Practice Statement  
It is the responsibility of both the Sponsor and the investigator(s) to ensure that this clinical study 
will be conducted in accordance with the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration 
of Helsinki, and that are consistent with the ICH guidelines for GCP and applicable regulatory 
requirem ents. 
13.2. Informed Consent  
The principles of informed consent are described in ICH guidelines for GCP.  
The ICF used by the investigator must be reviewed and approved by the Sponsor prior to 
submission to the appropriate IRB. A copy of the IRB -approved ICF and  documentation of 
approval must be provided to the Sponsor before study drug will be shipped to the study site.  
It is the responsibility of the investigator or designee (if acceptable by local regulations) to obtain 
written informed consent from each subje ct prior to his/her participation in the study and after the 
aims, methods, objectives, and potential hazards of the study have been explained to the subject in 
language that he/she can understand. The ICF should be signed and dated by the subject and by 
the investigator or authorized designee who reviewed the ICF with the subject.  
• Subjects who can write but cannot read will have the ICF read to them before signing 
and dating the ICF.  
• Subjects who can understand but who can neither write nor read will have  the ICF read 
to them in presence of an impartial witness, who will sign and date the ICF to confirm 
that informed consent was given.  
The original ICF must be retained by the investigator as part of the subject's study record, and a 
copy of the signed ICF must be given to the subject.  
If new safety information results in significant changes in the risk/benefit assessment, or if there 
are significant changes to the study procedures, the ICF must be reviewed and updated 
appropriately. All study subjects must be informed of the new information and provide their 
written consent if they wish to continue in the study. The original signed revised ICF must be 
maintained in the subject’s study record and a copy must be given to the subject.  
13.3. Subjects Confidentiality a nd Data Protection  
The investigator must take all appropriate measures to ensure that the anonymity of each study 
subject will be maintained. Subjects should be identified by a subject identification number only,

Statistical Analyses  The primary objective of the study is the evaluation of the long- term safety and 
tolerability of VX -445 in TC with TEZ/IVA. The safety endpoints of long -term 
treatment include AEs, clinical laboratory values, ECGs, vital signs, and pulse 
oximetry from the first dose of study drug in the open -label study, for subjects 
who received at least 1 dose of study drug in the open- label study. The safety 
analysis  will be descriptive  only,  and in general  will be performed  for the pooled 
population.  
The secondary objective of the study is the evaluation of long -term efficacy of 
VX-445 in TC with TEZ/IVA, as assessed by spirometry, documentation of 
events  related to health  outcomes  (e.g., PEx),  height  (for ≤21 years  of age on the 
date of informed  consent  in the parent  study  only),  weight,  and CFQ -R. Methods 
of efficacy analyses will be similar as those used in parent studies.  
 
Interim Analyses  Interim analyses may take place at any time during the study at the discretion of 
the sponsor.  In the event  that a parent  study  is still ongoing,  a limited  Vertex  team 
may be unblinded to the treatment assignments in the parent studies for the 
purpose of reviewing the interim results and will not be involved in or influence 
the conduct of the remaining  part of the parent  study  to protect  the integrity  of the 
parent study.  
 
IDMC Reviews  The independent  data monitoring committee  (IDMC) will conduct regular  safety 
reviews of study data as outlined in the IDMC charter.

a All assessments will be performed before  dosing unless  noted otherwise.  
b If the subject prematurely  discontinues  study drug treatment, an ETT Visit  should be scheduled as  soon as  possible  after the decision to discontinue  treatment  (Section  9.1.3).  
c The Safety  Follow -up Visit is required for all subjects. Refer to Section 9.1.2 for subjects who transition to a commercially  available or managed access program -supplied 
next-generation corrector TC regimen.  For subjects  who complete  an ETT  Visit  3 weeks  or later following the last dose of study  drug,  the ETT Visit  will replace  the Safety 
Follow -up Visit (Section 9.1.3 ). 
d The Day 1 Visit of this study will be on the same day as the last scheduled visit of the parent study. Subjects will NOT have to repeat any Day 1 assessments that were 
specified to be performed at the last scheduled visit in the parent study. Subjects who were enrolled and remained clinically  stable but had Day 1 study drug administration 
procedures delayed by no more than 7 days for reasons not related to their clinical status will have to repeat the safety (Se ction 11.7) and spirometry (Section 11.6.1) 
assessments that were  specified to be  performed at  the Day 1 Visit  before  receiving their first dose of study drug.  Subjects  who have  not received the  first dose of study drug 
within 7  days of the last dose of study drug in the parent  study,  or subjects  who had Day 1 study drug administration procedures  delayed by  no more  than 7 days  for a reason 
related to clinical status, will have to repeat all Day 1 assessments (Section 9.1.1 ). 
e The ICF and, when  appropriate,  assent  form,  can be signed up to 28 days prior to Day  1. 
f The CFQ -R must  be completed before  the start of any other  assessments scheduled at  relevant  visits  (Section  11.6.3).  
g  Weight  and height  will be measured with shoes  off. Height  will be collected only for subjects  ≤21 years  of age (on the  date of informed consent  in the  parent  study).  For 
subjects  >21 years  of age, the height  value  obtained from  the Screening  Visit  in the parent  study will be used for BMI  calculations.  Refer to Section  11.6.2 for additional 
information.

h Ophthalmologic  examinations  will only be conducted  on subjects  <18 years  of age (on the date of informed consent  in the parent  study) by a licensed ophthalmologist  or 
optometrist. These examinations should be completed within the specified 4 -week window around the relevant study visit.  
i A single  ophthalmologic  examination  is required at  completion  of study participation  (defined in Section  9.1.5 ) for subjects  <18 years  of age (on the date of informed consent  
in the parent  study) except  for those  subjects  who have  withdrawn  consent  or assent.  Ophthalmologic  examinations  are only required  if the cumulative drug exposure  (in the 
parent study and current study) is at least 12 weeks since the last study ophthalmologic examination (Section 11.7.6).  
j Subjects  will have  a complete  physical  examination  as defined in Section 11.7.3.  Symptom -directed  physical  examinations  will occur  at any time during the study if deemed 
necessary by the investigator.  
k Pregnancy tests will be performed for all female  subjects  of childbearing potential  as described  in Section 11.7.2 . At assessment  time points  when  telephone  contact  takes  the 
place of a clinic visit, a urine pregnancy test will be performed with a home kit provided by the study site. Results will be  reported to the site by telephone.  
l Blood samples for FSH will be measured  as outlined in Section  11.7.2.  
m All standard  12-lead  ECGs will be performed after the subject  has been  at rest for at least 5 minutes.  ECGs will  be collected  before  dosing (as applicable).  
n Vital  signs  and pulse  oximetry  will be collected  before  dosing and after the subject  has been at  rest for at least 5 minutes  (Section 11.7.3 and Section 11.7.4).  
o Spirometry assessments must  be performed  before  study drug dosing (Section 9.6.1 ) and should be performed  pre-bronchodilator (Section 11.6.1) at approximately the same 
time each visit.

5 INTRODUCTION  
5.1 Background  
Cystic  fibrosis  (CF)  is an autosomal  recessive chronic  disease  with serious  morbidities  and 
frequent premature mortality. At present, there is no cure. CF affects approximately  
70,000 individuals  worldwide1 (approximately  30,000 in the US1,2 and 39,000 in the EU3). Based 
on its prevalence, CF qualifies as an orphan disease.4, 5 
CF is caused  by decreased  quantity and/or  function of the CFTR  protein  due to mutations  in the 
CFTR gene. The CFTR protein is an epithelial chloride channel that aids in regulating salt and 
water absorption and secretion and pH balance in sweat glands and multiple organs, including the lungs, pancreas, and other gastrointestinal organs. Despite progress in the treatment of CF with antibiotics and mucolytics, the predicted median age of survival for a person with CF is approximately 40 years.
2,6 Progressive loss of lung function is the leading cause of mortality.7 
More effective treatments are needed for CF.  
The most  common  disease- causing CFTR mutation,  F508del , accounts  for 70% of the identified 
alleles in people with CF8, and approximately 40% of people with CF are homozygous for 
F508del (F/F). 2, 3, 8 
Based  on the  understanding of the  molecular  defects caused by  CFTR mutations,  
2 complementary approaches have been developed to address the decreased quantity and/or function of CFTR  in order  to enhance  chloride  transport  in patients with  CF. Correctors  facilitate 
the cellular processing and trafficking to increase the quantity of functional CFTR at the cell surface. Potentiators increase the channel open probability of the CFTR protein delivered to the cell surface to enhance ion transport. Depending on the amount of residual CFTR channel activity  in the membrane,  and the pathophysiology of that activity  (reflecting  the CFTR genotype 
of the patient and possibly other factors), both approaches may be required.  
The therapeutic  activity  of CFTR  correctors and potentiators  has been  established  with products 
that were developed by Vertex and approved for the treatment of CF: ivacaftor (IVA) monotherapy (Kalydeco
®), and lumacaftor (LUM) in combination with IVA (Orkambi®). 
Kalydeco  and Orkambi  are approved to treat CF in patients  with specific CFTR genotypes. A 
second corrector/potentiator combination, tezacaftor (TEZ)/IVA (Symdeko®) is approved in 
certain countries.  
VX-445 is a next-generation CFTR  corrector being developed for administration  in triple 
combination (TC) with TEZ/IVA for the treatment of CF.  
5.2 Rationale for the Present  Study 
Subjects who complete the last Treatment Period visit in a parent study and meet eligibility are 
eligible  to enroll.  Parent  studies  are Phase 3 Vertex  studies  investigating  VX-445 in combination 
with TEZ and IVA. These  include, but are  not limited to, Study VX17 -445-102 (Study 445-102) 
and Study VX17 -445-103 (Study 445-103). This study will provide  data on the long- term safety, 
efficacy, and durability of VX- 445 in TC with TEZ and IVA in subjects with CF who are 
homozygous or heterozygous for the F508del mutation.  
Based  on the data from  nonclinical  and clinical  studies  of VX-445, TEZ,  and IVA  to date and the 
current unmet medical need for new CF treatments, the development of this treatment offers 
potential benefit for CF patients.

Visit.  For subjects who complete  an ETT Visit 3 weeks or later following  the last dose of study 
drug, the ETT Visit will replace the Safety Follow -up Visit (Section 9.1.3). 
9.1.3  Early  Termination of  Treatment  
If a subject  prematurely  discontinues  study drug treatment,  an ETT Visit should be scheduled  as 
soon as possible after the decision to discontinue treatment.  
If the ETT Visit occurs 3 weeks  or later following  the last dose of study drug, then the ETT Visit 
will replace the Safety Follow -up Visit, and a separate Safety Follow -up Visit will not be 
required.  
During the course of study conduct, if local health authorities decline to approve the TC of 
VX-445/TEZ/IVA, or if clinical benefit is not demonstrated for the use of the TC for the 
treatment of CF in specific subpopulations enrolled in this study, subjects with the relevant CFTR genotypes may be discontinued after communication to investigators and IRBs/IECs of 
the risks/benefits  related  to the safety  and efficacy  observed for the relevant  subset  of subjects.  
If a subject withdraws from the study and also withdraws consent or assent, no further assessments  will be performed.  Vertex  may retain  and continue  to use any data and samp les 
collected before such withdrawal of consent or assent.  
9.1.4  Lost  to Follow -up 
A subject  will be  considered lost to follow -up if both  of the  following  occur:  
• The subject  misses 2 consecutive study  visits  (telephone  contact  and/or  clinic  visit) and is 
subsequently unable to be contacted by telephone (3 documented attempts by telephone within 2 weeks following the second missed visit)  
• The subject  does not respond within  2 weeks to a registered  letter sent after the 3 attempted 
telephone contacts.  
9.1.5  Completion of Study Participation  
Completion of study participation  for each individual  subject  is defined as: the Safety  Follow -up 
Visit; or, in situations in which the ETT Visit or the Week 192 Visit replace the Safety Follow - 
up Visit (Section 9.1.2 ), the ETT Visit or the Week 192 Visit.  
If subjects  withdraw  consent  or assent,  completion  of study participation  is defined as date of 
withdrawal of consent or assent, whichever is earlier (Section 9.9).  
If subjects  are lost to follow -up (Section  9.1.4), the date of completion  of study participation  will 
be defined as the date of last contact.  
The end of  study is defined in Section  13.2.8.  
9.1.6  Independent  Data  Monitoring  Committee  
This study will be monitored by an independent  data monitoring committee  (IDMC),  which  will 
conduct periodic reviews of safety data (Section 12.3.6.2). Procedural details of the IDMC structure and function, frequency of meetings, and data planned for review will be included in the IDMC charter. The IDMC charter will be finalized before the first subject is enrolled.

9.2 Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatment  Groups  
This is an open- label  study. Randomization is not required because all subjects will be treated 
identically in a single cohort.  
9.3 Rationale for Study Design and Study Drug Regimens  
9.3.1  Study Design 
This Phase 3 study will enroll  subjects who completed  the last Treatment  Period  visit in a parent 
study of TC VX- 445/TEZ/IVA  and meet eligibility  criteria. Results  from this  study will provide 
information on the long -term safety and efficacy of TC treatment with VX -445/TEZ/IVA in 
subjects with CF who are aged 12 years and older and homozygous or heterozygous for the 
F508del mutation, as per the populations enrolled in the parent studies.  
9.3.2  Study Drug  Dose and Duration  
All subjects will receive a TC of VX-445/TEZ/IVA  at the same dosage  as that in the parent 
studies (including, but not limited to, Study 445- 102 and Study 445- 103). 
The overall  treatment  duration will be 192 weeks.  This duration  will be used to evaluate  the 
long- term efficacy of VX -445/TEZ/IVA beyond 96 weeks of treatment.  
9.3.3  Rationale for Study Assessments  
All safety  assessments are standard  parameters for clinical studies in drug development. The PD 
and efficacy parameters being evaluated (e.g., SwCl, spirometry, PEx, anthropometric measurements, and patient -reported outcomes) are widely  accepted and generally  recognized as 
reliable, accurate, and relevant to the study of patients in CF. These parameters were routinely measured in the parent studies, as well as the registration studies of IVA (Kalydeco) or LUM/IVA combination therapy (Orkambi).  
Obstruction of airways with thick mucus, chronic bacterial infection of the airways, and inflammatory  response  all play a role in causing lung damage  in CF. Therefore,  assessments of 
inflammatory mediators and other biomarkers are included.  
9.4 Study Restrictions  
9.4.1  Prohibited Medications  
Table  9-1 lists prohibited  medications.  A non-exhaustive  list of study prohibitions  and cautions 
for medication will be provided in the Study Reference Manual.

extensively via CYP3A4. Therefore, use of 
moderate and strong  inducers  and inhibitors 
of CYP3A,  which  have  the potential  to alter 
the exposure  of VX-445, TEZ,  or IVA, will 
be prohibited.  
  
 
 
These  agents  may confound  the results  of 
this study.

a Ciprofloxacin  is not a moderate CYP3A inhibitor  on the basis  of results  of a drug-drug interaction  study 
conducted with IVA, a sensitive CYP3A substrate (Kalydeco [ivacaftor] US Package Insert).  
 
9.5 Prior  and Concomitant  Medications  
Information regarding prior and concomitant medications, including CF medications, other 
medications, and herbal and naturopathic remedies, will be collected in each subject’s source documentation for medications  taken  within  the 56 days before  the first dose of study drug in this 
study through completion of study participation, as defined in Section 9.1.5. 
• Subjects should remain on a stable treatment regimen for their CF through completion of 
study participation. Stable  treatment  regimen  is defined as the current  treatment regimen  for 
CF that subjects have been following for at least 28 days before Day  1. Subjects should not 
initiate long -term treatment with new medication from 28 days before the Day 1 Visit 
through completion of study participation. Subjects who are taking inhaled tobramycin or 
other chronically inhaled antibiotics should remain on that regimen throughout the study. 
• Subjects  may receive doses  of prednisone  or prednisolone  of up to 10 mg/day chronically, or 
up to 60 mg daily for up to 5 days.  
• VX-445 may inhibit OATP1B1 and OATP1B3, which may increase the exposure of 
medicinal products  that are substrates  for these  transporters.  Substrates  such as statins, 
glyburide, nateglinide, and repaglinide should be used with caution.  
• IVA is a weak inhibitor of P -glycoprotein (P -gp). Administration of IVA may increase 
systemic exposure of medicinal products that are sensitive substrates of P -gp, which may 
increase or prolong their therapeutic effect  and adverse reactions.  Digoxin or other  substrates 
of P-gp with a narrow therapeutic index, such as cyclosporine, everolimus, sirolimus, and 
tacrolimus, should be used with caution and appropriate monitoring.  
Protocol  VX17 -445-105, Version  5.0 Page  25 of 58 
Vertex  Pharmaceuticals  Incorporated  Confidential  Information   
  
• IVA may inhibit CYP2C9; therefore during coadministration with warfarin, additional 
monitoring  of the international normalized  ratio is recommended.  Other  medicinal  products 
that are CYP2C9 substrates for which exposure may be increased include glimepiride and glipizide; these should be used with caution.  
• Information about bronchodilator use during the study will be collected and documented. Subjects  who are using a bronchodilator  must  have  their spirometry  assessments  performed 
according to the guidelines provided in Section 11.6.1. 
9.6 Administration  
9.6.1  Dosing 
Study drug will be administered  orally. Additional  information  is provided in the Pharmacy 
Manual.  
Study drug will be administered  with a fat-containing meal  or snack,  such as  a standard "CF" 
meal or snack, or a standard meal.  
1. It is recommended that  the dose be taken  within 30 minutes  of the start of the meal  or snack.  
2. Study drug will be administered as 2 fixed -dose combination (FDC) TC tablets in the 
morning and 1 IVA tablet in the evening. For each subject,  doses of study drug will be taken 
at approximately the same time (± 2 hours) each day. 
3. The date, amount taken, and time of study drug administration, including whether food was 
taken with each dose, will be recorded for the 2 doses before pharmacokinetic (PK) sample 
collection  (Week  4) and the dose received  on the morning of PK sample collection  (Week 4).  
4. On days of scheduled visits, the morning dose of TC will be administered at the site after predose  assessments have  been  completed.  A meal  or snack  will be provided by the site for 
the morning dose of TC. 
5. If a subject’s scheduled  visit is to occur  in the afternoon, the following guidelines  must  be 
used:  
• If the dose in the clinic will be within 6 hours of the subject’s scheduled morning dose, 
the subject  should withhold  their morning  dose of TC and the morning dose of TC will be 
administered in the clinic.  
• If the dose in the clinic  will be more  than 6 hours  after the subject’s scheduled morning 
dose of TC, the subject should take the morning dose of TC at home.  
6. Subjects  will be instructed  to bring all used and unused materials  associated  with the study 
drug to the site; study drug will be dispensed at each visit, as appropriate.  
9.6.2  Missed Doses 
If 6 hours  or less have  passed  since the missed  morning  or evening dose, the subject  should take 
the missed dose as soon as possible and continue on the original schedule.  
Morning  dose : If more  than 6 hours  have  passed  since the missed  morning  dose, the subject 
should take the missed dose as soon as possible and should not take the evening dose.  
Protocol  VX17 -445-105, Version  5.0 Page  26 of 58 
Vertex  Pharmaceuticals  Incorporated  Confidential  Information   
  
Evening dose : If more than 6 hours have passed since the missed evening dose, the subject 
should not take the missed  dose. The next scheduled  morning dose should be taken  at the usual 
time.  
Morning and evening doses should not  be taken at the same time.  
9.7 Dose Modification  for Toxicity  
No dose modifications for toxicity  are allowed. Treatment  may be interrupted  as outlined in 
Section 9.8. If any unacceptable toxicity arises, individual subjects will discontinue dosing 
(Section 9.1.3).  
9.8 Study Drug Interruption and Stopping Rules  
The medical  monitor should be notified  of an interruption of study drug that lasts  >72 hours for 
any reason and of the resumption of study drug after such interruption. 
9.8.1  Liver  Function Tests  
The central laboratory will notify the medical monitor of ALT or AST >3 × upper limit of normal (ULN)  and total bilirubin  >2 × ULN that are derived from  centrally  submitted  samples.  
Subjects with new treatment -emergent ALT or AST elevations of >3 × ULN, with or without 
total bilirubin >2 × ULN,  must be followed  closely,  including confirmatory  testing  performed  by 
the central laboratory within 48 to 72 hours of the initial finding and subsequent close monitoring of ALT, AST, and bilirubin levels, as clinically indicated. 
If a subject cannot return to the site for confirmatory testing, a local laboratory may be used. 
Local laboratory results must be reported immediately to the medical monitor, and the subject must have the tests repeated  and sent to the central  laboratory  as soon as possible (ideally  within 
48 to 72 hours). 
Study drug administration  must  be interrupted  immediately  (prior  to confirmatory  testing)  if 
any of the following criteria are met:  
• ALT  or AST  >8 × ULN  
• ALT  or AST  >5 × ULN  for more  than 2 weeks  
• ALT  or AST  >3 × ULN,  in association  with total bilirubin  >2 × ULN and/or clinical jaundice  
A thorough investigation  of potential causes should be conducted, and the subject  should be 
followed closely for clinical progression.  
Study drug administration  must  be discontinued  if the  following criterion is  met: 
• Subsequent ALT or AST values confirm the initial elevation that satisfied the interruption rule (above), and no convincing alternative  etiology (e.g., acetaminophen use, viral hepatitis, 
alcohol ingestion) is identified, regardless of whether transaminase levels have improved. 
All subjects  in whom treatment is discontinued for elevated  transaminases  (and bilirubin,  as 
applicable) should have these levels monitored closely until levels normalize or return to baseline.  
If an alternative,  reversible  cause of transaminase elevation  with or without increased  bilirubin  or 
clinical jaundice has been identified, study drug administration may be resumed once 
Protocol  VX17 -445-105, Version  5.0 Page  27 of 58 
Vertex  Pharmaceuticals  Incorporated  Confidential  Information   
  
transaminases return to baseline or are ≤ 2 × ULN, whichever is higher. Regardless of the 
duration of interruption, the medical monitor should be notified prior to resumption of study 
drug. Upon resumption  of study drug, transaminases and bilirubin should  be assessed  weekly  for 
4 weeks. If a protocol -defined transaminase elevation interruption threshold recurs within  
4 weeks of rechallenge with the study drug (with confirmation of the initial elevation by repeat 
testing  within  48 to 72 hours), then the study drug must  be permanently  discontinued, regardless 
of the presumed etiology. 
9.8.2  Rash 
Individuals who develop generalized rash will be monitored closely. Study drug dosing should 
be interrupted if a subject develops a generalized rash of Grade 3 or higher, or a rash that is 
considered a serious adverse event. The investigator will notify  the medical monitor of any rash 
that results in interruption of study drug, is Grade 3 or higher (Section 13.1.1.4), or is a serious 
adverse event (SAE). Investigators should consider additional evaluation including laboratory 
testing  (e.g., complete blood count [CBC] with differential, LFTs), photographs of the rash, and 
dermatology  consultation. The investigator  may consider  resumption  of study drug if considered 
clinically appropriate.  
9.9 Removal  of Subjects  
Subjects may withdraw from the study at any time at their own request. Subjects may be 
withdrawn from study drug treatment at any time at the discretion of the investigator or Vertex for safety,  behavior,  noncompliance  with study procedures,  or administrative  reasons. If  a subject 
has been withdrawn from study drug treatment, the subject will continue to be followed,  
provided that the subject has not withdrawn consent (and assent, as applicable).  
In addition, a subject  must  be discontinued from study drug treatment if the subject  meets  any of 
the following criteria:  
• Meets  any of the  stopping  (discontinuation) criteria  (Section  9.8) 
• Becomes pregnant  (Section 11.7.7.2)  
If a subject does not return for a scheduled visit, reasonable effort will be made to contact the subject. In any circumstance,  reasonable  effort will be made  to document  subject  outcome. The 
investigator will inquire about the reason for withdrawal, request that the subject return all unused investigational product(s), request that the subject return for an ETT Visit and Safety Follow -up Visit, if applicable (see Section 9.1.3 ), and follow up with the  subject regarding any 
unresolved AEs. 
If the subject withdraws consent or assent for the study, no further assessments will be 
performed. Vertex may retain and continue using the study data and samples after the study is over, and may use the samples and information in the development of the study  compound, and 
for other  drugs  and diagnostics,  in publications  and presentations,  and for education purposes. If 
the subject withdraws from the study, the study data and samples collected will remain part of the study. A subject will not be able to request the withdrawal of his/her information from the study data. A subject may request destruction of the samples collected from him/her during the 
study as long as those samples can be identified as his/her samples.  
If evaluation of efficacy data from the parent studies suggests that the VX -445/TEZ/IVA 
treatment does not provide  clinically  meaningful  benefit  for subsets  of subjects included  in these  
Protocol  VX17 -445-105, Version  5.0 Page  28 of 58 
Vertex  Pharmaceuticals  Incorporated  Confidential  Information   
  
studies, Vertex may recommend that subjects with relevant genotypes discontinue from the 
study. In addition, if local health authorities decline to approve VX -445/TEZ/IVA, or if clinical 
benefit is not demonstrated for the use of VX -445/TEZ/IVA for the treatment of CF in specific 
subpopulations enrolled in this study, subjects with the relevant CFTR genotypes may be discontinued  after communication to investigators  and IRBs/IECs  of the risks/benefits  related  to 
the safety and efficacy observed for the relevant subset of subjects.  
9.10 Replacement  of Subjects  
Subjects  who withdraw  or are withdrawn  during the study drug treatment  period will not be 
replaced.  
10 STUDY DRUG  INFORMATION  AND MANAGEMENT  
Study drug refers  to VX- 445/TEZ/IVA  and IVA.  
10.1 Preparation and Dispensing

10.4 Drug  Accountability  
The pharmacist or designated study site staff will maintain information regarding the dates and 
amounts  of (1) study drug received;  (2) study drug dispensed to the subjects; and (3) study drug 
Protocol  VX17 -445-105, Version  5.0 Page  29 of 58 
Vertex  Pharmaceuticals  Incorporated  Confidential  Information   
  
returned by the subjects. Subjects will be instructed to return all used and unused materials 
associated  with the study  drug to the site. These materials  will be retained  at the site according  to 
instructions provided by Vertex or its designee. The study monitor will review study drug 
records and inventory throughout the study.  
If a site uses a site- specific drug accountability system and/or process, including processes 
associated with the destruction of returned materials, the process must be documented and approved by Vertex.  The study monitor  must  review  the drug accountability  documentation on a 
regular  basis. The  study monitor will promptly  communicate to Vertex any  discrepancies he/she 
is unable to resolve with the site.  
10.5 Disposal,  Return,  or Retention of Unused Drug  
The study site staff or pharmacy  personnel  will retain  all materials  returned by the subjects until 
the study monitor has performed drug accountability. The investigator will ensure that the materials are destroyed in compliance with applicable environmental regulations, institutional policy, and any special instructions provided by Vertex. Destruction will be adequately documented.  
10.6 Compliance  
To ensure  treatment  compliance,  the investigator or designee  will supervise  all study  drug dosing 
that occurs at the site. At each visit, site personnel will review that the subject is compliant with study drug dosing and remind the subject of study drug dosing requirements. Compliance will also be assessed by ongoing study drug count.  
If a subject  demonstrates  continued noncompliance  of study drug dosing despite educational 
efforts, the investigator should consider discontinuing the subject from the study.  
10.7 Blinding and Unblinding  
This will be an open- label study. However, as outlined in Section 11.4 and Section 11.6.1, 
subjects (and their parents/caregivers/companions) should not be informed of their study -related 
spirometry  and SwCl results until Vertex has determined that the study  has completed (i.e., CSR 
finalization).  Individual  SwCl  test results  will also not be disclosed  to the study sites.  In addition, 
the Vertex study team will not have access to the spirometry  or SwCl results of the present study 
until the database lock of the parent study.  
11 ASSESSMENTS  
11.1 Timing of  Assessments  
The timing  of assessments is shown in Section  3 and Table  3-1. 
11.2 Subject  and Disease Characteristics

Protocol  VX17 -445-105, Version  5.0 Page  30 of 58 
Vertex  Pharmaceuticals  Incorporated  Confidential  Information   
  
11.3 Pharmacokinetics  
11.3.1  Blood Sampling  
At the Week 4 Visit only, predose blood samples will be collected to determine plasma 
concentrations  of VX-445, TEZ,  M1-TEZ,  and IVA.  These samples  may also be used to evaluate 
metabolites of VX -445 and IVA, and additional TEZ metabolites, for further evaluation of the 
bioanalytical method, or for exploratory analyses that provide information on the metabolic 
pathways used by or affected by VX -445, which may not be included in the CSR.  
The Week  4 predose  samples must  be collected  within  60 minutes  before  dosing;  all efforts 
should be made to obtain the PK samples during this specified window. Samples collected outside of the window will be considered protocol deviations.  
A record  of study drug administration  that coincides  with the Week 4  PK blood draw  will be 
collected as described in Section 9.6. The collection date and exact time that each PK blood 
sample is drawn will also be recorded.  
Samples from the  PK sampling  will be  kept frozen by Vertex or its  designee  until all analyses 
have  been  completed  and then disposed  of according to Vertex  or designee standard  operating 
procedures.  
11.3.2  Processing and Handling of Pharmacokinetic Samples  
Detailed  procedures  for the collection  of blood samples and further  procedures  for processing 
and handling of samples for PK analysis will be provided in the PK Sample Handling Guidelines.  
11.3.3  Bioanalysis  
Samples will be analyzed using validated analytical methods in compliance with Vertex or designee  standard operating procedures.  A description of the assays and validation  data will be 
provided in separate reports.  
11.4 Pharmacodynamics:  Sweat  Chloride  
SwCl samples will be collected with an approved collection device. Each collection will occur before  study  drug dosing  (Section  9.6.1).  At each time point, 2 samples will be collected;  1 from 
each arm (left and right). Sweat samples will be sent to a central laboratory for testing and interpretation of results. Individual SwCl test results will not be disclosed to the study sites.  
Specific instructions  for the collection,  handling, processing, and shipping of SwCl  samples  to 
the central laboratory will be provided separately.  
Subjects  (and their parents/caregivers/companions) should not be informed  of their study -related 
SwCl results until Vertex has determined that the study has completed (i.e., CSR finalization), regardless of whether the subject has prematurely discontinued treatment.  
11.5 Exploratory Assessments  
These data will be used for internal  exploratory purposes  and may or may not be included in the 
CSR. Detailed procedures for the collection of blood samples and additional procedures for processing and handling samples will be provided in a separate document.  
Protocol  VX17 -445-105, Version  5.0 Page  31 of 58 
Vertex  Pharmaceuticals  Incorporated  Confidential  Information   
  
11.5.1  Inflammatory Mediators  
Blood samples (inflammatory mediator samples) will be collected at the time points noted in 
Table  3-1 and tested  to assess markers related  to inflammation.  These may include, but are not 
limited to, C -reactive protein (CRP), immunoglobulin G (IgG), white blood cell (WBC, 
leukocyte) count, and interleukin- 8 (IL -8). Specific instructions for the collection, processing, 
storage, and shipment of inflammatory mediator samples will be provided in the Laboratory Manual.  
11.5.2  Other  Blood  Biomarkers  
Serum  from an inflammatory  mediator sample  and an additional  blood sample for plasma  will be 
collected and banked for potential future exploratory evaluation of other blood biomarkers (e.g., proteins, peptides, lipids, metabolites, etc.) in relation to PK, PD, treatment response, AEs, and various disease manifestations of CF.  
Specific instructions  for the collection,  processing, storage,  and shipment  of blood biomarker 
samples will be provided in the Laboratory Manual.  
11.5.3  Microbiology and Other Sputum Biomarkers  
Sputum samples will be collected at the time points noted in Table 3 -1 from subjects who can 
produce a sample spontaneously. Each sample will be processed and frozen for potential exploratory evaluation of microbiology  analysis and sputum  biomarkers (which  may include, but 
are not limited to, qualitative and quantitative bacterial and viral assessments including genomic analyses, analysis of immune cells, inflammatory markers, proteins, peptides, lipids, and endogenous metabolites) in relation to PK, PD, treatment response, AEs, and various disease manifestations of CF.  
Specific instructions  for the collection,  processing, aliquoting, storage,  and shipment  of sputum 
samples will be provided in the Laboratory Manual.  
11.6 Efficacy  
11.6.1  Spirometry  
Spirometry  will be performed  according  to the American  Thoracic Society  Guidelines/European 
Respiratory Society Guidelines9 and according to the additional guidelines that follow.  
Pre-bronchodilator  spirometry  is defined  as spirometry  testing  performed  for subjects  who have  
• withheld  their short -acting  bronchodilators  (e.g.,  albuterol)  or anticholinergic  
(e.g., ipratropium bromide  [Atrovent®]) for more  than 4 hours  before  the spirometry 
assessment;  
• withheld  their long- acting  bronchodilator  (e.g., salmeterol) for more  than 12 hours  before  the 
spirometry assessment; and  
• withheld  their once -daily,  long- acting  bronchodilator  (e.g., tiotropium  bromide  [Spiriva®]) 
for more than 24 hours before the spirometry assessment.  
All spirometry assessments should be performed pre -bronchodilator. During the Treatment 
Period, spirometry  assessments  must  be performed  before  study  drug dosing (Section 9.6.1)  at 
Protocol  VX17 -445-105, Version  5.0 Page  32 of 58 
Vertex  Pharmaceuticals  Incorporated  Confidential  Information   
  
approximately the same time at each visit.  In the event  that a subject  forgets  to withhold 
bronchodilator(s), spirometry should be performed according to the following:  
• If a subject’s  Day 1 spirometry  assessment  from  the parent  study  is pre-bronchodilator, but 
on a subsequent visit in this study, the subject forgets to withhold bronchodilator use, a 
post-bronchodilator spirometry  assessment will be obtained for that visit only  and the visit 
will not be rescheduled.  
• If, on Day 1 of the parent  study, the subject  forgot  to withhold  his/her  dose of bronchodilator, 
spirometry should be performed post -bronchodilator and all subsequent spirometric 
measurements in this study (according to the schedule of assessments detailed in Table 3 -1) 
should be performed post -bronchodilator.  
• Each  spirometry  assessment  will be recorded  in the source  documents  as pre- or 
post-bronchodilator.  
All sites will be provided with spirometers  to be used for all study assessments.  Spirometry  data 
will be transmitted to a centralized spirometry service for quality review.  
Subjects  (and their parents/caregivers/companions) should not be informed  of their study -related 
spirometry results until Vertex has determined that the study has completed (i.e., CSR finalization), regardless of whether the subject has prematurely discontinued treatment.  
The measured  spirometric  values  listed  below  will be  converted to percent  predicted  values using 
the standard equations of Global Lung Function Initiative.

• FEV 1 (L) 
• Forced vital capacity  (FVC) (L)  
• FEV 1/FVC (ratio) 
• Forced  expiratory  flow, midexpiratory  phase  (FEF 25%-75%) (L/s)  
11.6.2  Height  and Weight  
Height and weight will be measured and with shoes off. For subjects whose date of informed consent occurs after their 21
st birthday, height will not be collected in this study. For subjects 
whose  date of  informed consent occurs on or  before their 21st birthday, height will be collected 
through the first visit after the subject’s  21st birthday and does not need  to be collected  at future 
visits.  
11.6.3  Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire- Revised  
The questionnaires  provide  information  about  demographics;  general  quality  of life, school, 
work, or daily activities; and symptom difficulties (pertaining to CF).  
Subjects will be asked to complete the CFQ -R in their native language, if validated translations 
are available.11, 12 If there is no validated translation available in the subject’s native language, 
the subject will not complete the questionnaire. Copies of the CFQ -R used will be provided in 
the Study Reference Manual.  Validated  translations  of the CFQ -R, if available,  will be provided 
for participating centers in non- English -speaking countries.13, 14 
The CFQ- R will  be completed  before  any other assessments are performed  at that visit.  
Protocol  VX17 -445-105, Version  5.0 Page  33 of 58 
Vertex  Pharmaceuticals  Incorporated  Confidential  Information   
  
At the Day 1 Visit of this study, subjects will complete the same version of the CFQ -R that was 
completed in the parent study. At all subsequent visits, subjects will complete the version of the 
CFQ- R appropriate  for the subject’s  age at the time of the visit.  Subjects  who are 12 and 13 years 
of age will complete the CFQ -R Child version themselves, and their parents/caregivers will 
complete the CFQ -R Parent version. Subjects who are 14 years of age and older will complete 
the Adolescent and Adult version.  
11.6.4  Other  Events Related to Outcome  
11.6.4.1  Antibiotic  Therapy for Sinopulmonary Sign/Symptoms  
New or changed antibiotic  therapy (IV, inhaled, or oral)  for the following  sinopulmonary 
signs/symptoms will be determined and documented at visits as indicated in Table 3 -1: 
• Change  in sputum  
• New or increased  hemoptysis  
• Increased  cough  
• Increased  dyspnea  
• Malaise,  fatigue, or lethargy  
• Temperature  above  38°C  (equivalent  to approximately  100.4°F)  
• Anorexia  or weight  loss 
• Sinus  pain or tenderness  
• Change  in sinus  discharge 
• Change  in physical  examination (PE) of the chest  
• Decrease in pulmonary function by 10% 
• Radiographic  changes  indicative  of pulmonary infection  
For this study,  PEx is defined  as a new or change  in antibiotic  therapy  (IV, inhaled,  or oral) 
for any 4 or more of the above signs/symptoms. This definition is based on the definition of a PEx used in previous clinical studies, including IVA clinical studies.
15,16  
It is recommended  that the study drug not be interrupted  during a PEx unless,  in the opinion of 
the investigator, it would be in the best interest of the subject.  
11.6.4.2  Hospitalization for CF 
Subjects will be queried about planned and unplanned hospitalizations lasting ≥ 24 hours that 
occurred  during the study. The dates of hospitalizations  and the reasons for hospitalizations  will 
be documented.  
For any hospitalization  (planned and unplanned), the procedures  for safety  reporting should also 
be followed. 
11.7 Safety  
Safety  evaluations  will include  AEs,  clinical  laboratory  assessments,  and clinical  evaluation  of 
vital signs, ECGs, PEs, and pulse oximetry.  
Protocol  VX17 -445-105, Version  5.0 Page  34 of 58 
Vertex  Pharmaceuticals  Incorporated  Confidential  Information   
  
Ophthalmologic  examinations  will be conducted only on subjects who are <18 years  of age on 
the date of informed consent in the parent study.  
11.7.1  Adverse Events  
All AEs will be assessed, documented, and reported in accordance with ICH GCP guidelines. 
Section 13.1 outlines the definitions, collection periods, criteria, and procedures for documenting, grading, and reporting  AEs.  A separate document  that details  AE case report  form 
(CRF) completion guidelines for investigators as well as training will be provided.  
11.7.2  Clinical  Laboratory Assessments  
Blood and urine  samples  will be analyzed  at a central  laboratory, with the exception  of the urine 
pregnancy tests. As described below, urine pregnancy tests will either be  analyzed by  the site or 
at home  using a home  kit. On Day 1, blood samples will be  collected  before  the first dose of the 
study drug.  
Laboratory  test results  that are abnormal  and considered  clinically  significant  will be reported as 
AEs.  
The safety  laboratory  test panels are shown in Table  11-1.

Pregnancy ( β-human chorionic gonadotropin) Tests  for Females of Childbearing  Potential: Any 
female  subject who does not meet the  criteria for non-childbearing potential is  considered to be 
of childbearing potential and must have a pregnancy test every 4 weeks. A definition of 
non-childbearing potential is provided in Section 11.7.7.1. Serum pregnancy tests will be 
performed at the study site and analyzed at the central laboratory. Urine pregnancy tests will 
either be performed  and analyzed  at the site or, at assessment  time points when  telephone contact 
takes the place of a clinic visit, at home by using a home kit provided by the site. Results of a home urine pregnancy test will be reported to the site by telephone. The urine pregnancy test on Day 1 must be negative before the first dose of study drug. Additional pregnancy tests may be required according to local regulations and/or requirements.  
Protocol  VX17 -445-105, Version  5.0 Page  36 of 58 
Vertex  Pharmaceuticals  Incorporated  Confidential  Information   
  
Follicle -stimulating  Hormone (FSH) : Blood samples for FSH will be measured  as needed  for any 
suspected postmenopausal female with at least 12 months of continuous spontaneous 
amenorrhea. Serum FSH levels must be in the postmenopausal range as determined by the laboratory performing the test.  
Additional E
 valuations: Additional clinical  laboratory  evaluations will be performed  at other 
times if judged to be clinically appropriate.  
For the purposes of study conduct and unless noted otherwise, only laboratory tests done in the central laboratory may be used. Local laboratories may be used at the discretion of the local investigator for management of urgent medical issues. If a local laboratory test value is found to be abnormal and clinically significant, it will be verified by the central laboratory as soon as possible after the investigator becomes aware of the abnormal result.  If it is not possible to send a 
timely specimen to the central laboratory (e.g., the subject was hospitalized elsewhere), the investigator may base the assessment of an AE on the local laboratory value.  
11.7.3  Physical  Examinations and Vital  Signs  
A PE of all body systems and  vital signs assessment  will be performed at the select  study visits 
(see Table 3 -1). At other visits, symptom- directed PEs and  symptom- directed vital sign 
assessments will occur at any time if deemed necessary by the investigator or healthcare provider.  
A complete PE includes a review of the following systems: head, neck, and thyroid; eyes, ears, nose, and throat (EENT); respiratory; cardiovascular; lymph nodes; abdomen; skin; musculoskeletal; and neurological. Breast, anorectal, and genital examinations will be performed 
when  medically  indicated.  Any clinically  significant abnormal findings in PEs will be reported  as 
AEs.  
Vital signs include blood  pressure (systolic  and diastolic),  temperature  (oral),  pulse rate, and 
respiration rate. These will be assessed before dosing  and following at least a 5 -minute rest.  
11.7.4  Pulse Oximetry  
Pulse oximetry is a noninvasive measure of oxygen delivery to the tissues and has been correlated with clinical status and lung function Arterial oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry will be assessed  following  at least a 5-minute  rest and before study drug dosing. At visits  when 
study drug is taken at the site, pulse oximetry will be collected before study drug dosing. 
11.7.5  Electrocardiograms  
Standard 12- lead ECGs will be performed using a machine with printout according to the 
schedule of assessments ( Table  3-1).  Additional standard  12-lead ECGs  will be performed  at any 
other time if clinically indicated. Subjects will be instructed to rest for at least 5 minutes before having an ECG performed. 
The ECG traces will be manually read at the study site. A printout of the ECG traces will be 
made for safety  review  by the investigator and maintained  with source documentation. Clinically 
significant ECG abnormalities occurring during the study through completion of study participation will be recorded as AEs.  
To ensure the safety of the subjects, a qualified individual at the study site will make comparisons to baseline measurements.  If the QTcF  is increased  by >60 msec from  the baseline  
Protocol  VX17 -445-105, Version  5.0 Page  37 of 58 
Vertex  Pharmaceuticals  Incorporated  Confidential  Information   
  
or an absolute QTcF value is ≥ 500 msec for any scheduled ECG, 2 additional ECGs will be 
performed  approximately 2 to 4 minutes  apart  to confirm  the original measurement.  If either of 
the QTcF  values  from these repeated  ECGs  remains  above  the threshold  value  (>60 msec from 
baseline or ≥500 msec), a single ECG will be repeated at least hourly until QTcF values from  
2 successive  ECGs  fall below  the threshold value  that triggered  the repeat  measurement.  Further 
details pertaining to ECGs will be provided to sites in the ECG Manual.  
11.7.6  Ophthalmologic Examination  
Ophthalmologic examinations will be conducted only for subjects who are <18 years of age on 
the date of informed  consent  in the parent  study. The examination  does not need to be completed 
if there is documentation of bilateral lens removal for the subject.  
All examinations  will be conducted by a licensed  ophthalmologist  or optometrist and will 
include  
• measurement  of best-corrected  distance visual  acuity  of each eye; and 
• pharmacologically  dilated examination of the lens with a slit lamp.  
Subjects <18 years of age on the  date of informed consent in the parent study are required to 
complete  ophthalmologic  examinations  as indicated  in Table  3-1. These  examinations  should be 
completed within the specified 4 -week window around the relevant study visit. A single 
ophthalmologic examination is required at completion of study participation (defined in  
Section  9.1.5); this examination  should be completed  within  4 weeks prior  to the last study visit 
except for subjects who have withdra wn consent or assent. Ophthalmologic examinations are 
only required if the cumulative  study  drug exposure  (in the  parent study  and current study) is  at 
least 12 weeks since the last study ophthalmologic examination. 
Any clinically  significant  abnormal  findings  will be  reported as AEs.  
11.7.7  Contraception and Pregnancy  
The effects  of VX-445, TEZ,  and IVA on conception, pregnancy, and lactation  in humans  are not 
known. VX-445, TEZ, and IVA  did not show genotoxic  potential  in a standard battery  of in vitro 
(Ames test, chromosomal aberration, or micronucleus in cultured mammalian cells) and in vivo 
(rodent micronucleus) studies. Reproductive toxicology studies of VX -445, TEZ, and IVA have 
not shown teratogenicity in rats and rabbits.  
11.7.7.1  Contraception 
Contraception  requirement  for a couple  is waived  for the following:  
• True abstinence for the subject, when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, postovulation methods)  and withdrawal are not acceptable methods  of contraception.  True  abstinence must 
be practiced from the date of informed consent through 90 days after the last dose of study drug.  
• If the male is infertile (e.g., bilateral orchiectomy). If a male subject is assumed to have complete  bilateral  absence of the vas deferens,  infertility  must  be documented before  the first 
dose of study drug (e.g., examination of a semen specimen or by demonstration of the absence of the vas deferens by ultrasound). 
Protocol  VX17 -445-105, Version  5.0 Page  38 of 58 
Vertex  Pharmaceuticals  Incorporated  Confidential  Information   
  
• If the female  is of non- childbearing  potential.  To be considered  of non-childbearing potential, 
the female must meet at least 1 of the following criteria:  
o Postmenopausal: Amenorrheic  for at least 12 consecutive months and a serum  FSH level 
within the laboratory’s reference range for postmenopausal females.  
o Documented hysterectomy  or bilateral oophorectomy/salpingo- oophorectomy.  
Note:  All other females  (including females  with tubal ligations) will be considered  to be of 
childbearing potential. 
• Same -sex relationships  
For subjects for whom the contraception requirement is not waived, study participation 
requires a commitment from the subject that at least 1 acceptable method  of contraception is 
used as a couple. Methods of contraception must  be in successful  use from signing  of consent (or 
assent, when applicable), approximately 28 days before the first dose of study drug (unless otherwise noted), and until 90 days following the last dose of study drug. Additional contraception requirements may need to be followed according to local regulations and/or requirements. Acceptable methods of contraception are listed in Table 11 -2.

Additional  notes:  
• If over the course of the study the subject  meets  the criteria  for waiving the contraception 
requirements, the subject does not need to follow the contraceptive methods listed in 
Table 11-2.  
• Male subjects  must not donate sperm  during the period starting  from the first dose of study 
drug until 90 days after the last dose of study drug. 
• Female subjects should not nurse a child  during the period starting  from the first dose of 
study drug until 90 days after the last dose of study drug. 
Protocol  VX17 -445-105, Version  5.0 Page  39 of 58 
Vertex  Pharmaceuticals  Incorporated  Confidential  Information   
  
• For male subjects with a female partner of childbearing  potential, the couple should not plan 
to become pregnant during the study or within 90 days after the last dose of study drug, with 
the exception  of couples  who  plan to  become  pregnant  by artificial insemination using  sperm 
banked by the male subject before the first dose of study  drug or sperm from another source.  
11.7.7.2  Pregnancy 
Subjects  will be counseled  to inform  the investigator  of any pregnancy that occurs  during study 
treatment and for 90 days after the last dose of study drug.  
If a female subject  becomes pregnant  during study  participation,  study drug will be permanently 
discontinued immediately. The investigator will notify the medical monitor and Vertex GPS 
within 24 hours of the site’s knowledge of the subject’s (or partner’s) pregnancy using the Pregnancy Information Collection Form. Male subjects with female partners who become pregnant during the study must use a male condom to avoid exposure of a potential embryo or fetus to study drug via the seminal fluid. 
The subject or partner will be followed until the end of the pregnancy and the infant will be 
followed  for 1 year  after the birth,  provided informed  consent  is obtained. A separate ICF will be 
provided to explain these follow -up activities. Pregnancy itself does not constitute an AE.  
12 STATISTICAL  AND ANALYTICAL  PLANS  
This section presents a summary of the planned analyses for this protocol. Statistical analysis details will be provided in the statistical analysis plan (SAP),  and clinical  pharmacologic  analysis 
details will be provided in the clinical pharmacology analysis  plan (CPAP),  both of which  will be 
finalized before the clinical data lock for the study.  
12.1 Sample Size and Power  
The primary  and secondary  objectives  of the study  are the evaluation  of the long- term safety  and 
tolerability,  and long- term efficacy  of VX-445 in TC  with TEZ/IVA.  This is  an open- label  study 
that will enroll subjects who complete the last Treatment Period visit in a parent study  and meet 
eligibility criteria. Parent studies are Phase 3 Vertex studies investigating VX -445 in 
combination with TEZ and IVA. These include, but are not limited to, Study 445- 102 and 
Study 445-103. 
Over 400 subjects are expected to enroll in this open -label study of 196 weeks’ duration. With 
this number of subjects exposed to VX -445/TEZ/IVA treatment, AEs by Preferred Term (PT) 
that occur with a frequency  of >1% will be ruled out with 95% confidence, when zero events are 
observed in that PT. Further, with over 400 subjects exposed to VX -445/TEZ/IVA treatment for 
at least 24 weeks,  the half-width  of the 95% CI for estimating  the cumulative  incidence  of PEx of 
CF is less than 6% assuming an observed incidence of 30%.  
12.2 Analysis Sets 
The Open- label  All Subjects  Set is defined  as all subjects  who were  enrolled (defined  as subject 
having data in the clinical database) in the open -label study. This analysis set will be used for 
individual subject data listings and disposition summary tables unless otherwise specified.  
The Open- label  Full Analysis  Set (OL-FAS)  is defined  as all enrolled subjects  who have 
received  at least 1 dose of study drug in the  open- label  study. The  OL-FAS will be  used to  
Protocol  VX17 -445-105, Version  5.0 Page  40 of 58 
Vertex  Pharmaceuticals  Incorporated  Confidential  Information   
  
summarize  subject  demographics  and baseline characteristics and for all efficacy  analyses unless 
otherwise specified.  
The Open- label  Safety  Set (OL-SS) is defined as all subjects  who have  received  at least 1 dose 
of study drug in the open- label study. The OL -SS will be used for all safety analyses unless 
otherwise specified.  
12.3 Statistical  Analysis  
12.3.1  General  Considerations  
Continuous variables will be summarized using the following descriptive summary statistics: 
the number of subjects (n), mean, SD, median, minimum value (min), and maximum value 
(max). The precision of the measurement for each continuous variable will be specified in the SAP.  Unless otherwise  specified,  min and max values  will be reported  with the same precision  as 
the units of the raw data. The mean, median, and SD will be reported to 1 additional decimal 
place. Any values that require a transformation to standard units (metric or SI) will be converted 
with the appropriate precision.  
Categorical  variables  will be summarized  using counts  and percentages.  Percentages will be 
presented to 1 decimal place.  
The baseline  value , unless  otherwise  specified,  for the long- term safety  analysis  will be the most 
recent non -missing measurement (scheduled or unscheduled) collected before the first dose of 
VX-445 in TC with TEZ/IVA either in the parent study or the open- label study, as applicable.  
The baseline  value for  the long- term efficacy  analysis will be defined as the most  recent  
non-missing measurement (scheduled or unscheduled) collected before the first dose of study 
drug in the parent  study. For assessments collected  in duplicate  or triplicate,  the baseline will be 
defined as the average of non -missing values.  
Baseline characteristics of  subjects  in the open- label  study will be the same as the baseline 
characteristics in the parent study.  
Change  (absolute  change)  from baseline  will be calculated  as post-baseline  value  - baseline 
value.  
The Efficacy  Analysis  Period in  the open- label  study will include  the time from the first dose of 
study drug in the open- label study to the last scheduled efficacy visit in the open- label study, 
unless otherwise specified.  
The Treatment -emergent (TE) Period in the open- label study will include the time from the 
first dose of study drug in the open- label study to 28 days after the last dose of the study drug in 
the open- label  study or to the completion date of study participation  (as defined  in Section 9.1.5 ), 
whichever occurs first.  
The long- term efficacy analysis will be performed by parent study for the Efficacy Analysis 
Period  in the open- label  study, with the only exception  of time to first PEx where  events  in the 
parent study may also be included.  
In general, long- term safety  analysis  will be performed  in a pooled fashion.

12.3.2  Background Characteristics  
12.3.2.1  Subject  Disposition  
Subject disposition will be summarized for the Open -label All Subjects Set. The number and 
percentage of subjects in the following  categories for the open -label  study will be summarized  as 
appropriate:  
• Open -label  All Subjects  Set 
• Dosed  (OL-SS) 
• Enrolled  and dosed (OL-FAS)  
• Completed  Treatment  Period  
• Prematurely  discontinued  treatment and  the reasons for discontinuation  
• Completed  study 
• Prematurely  discontinued the study and the  reasons for discontinuation  
12.3.2.2  Demographics and Baseline Characteristics  
Demographics, background (e.g., medical history), and baseline characteristics will be 
summarized  by descriptive  summary  statistics.  Baseline characteristics  will be the same  as the 
parent study baseline characteristics.  
The following demographics and baseline characteristics will be summarized for the OL -FAS 
and will include (but not limited to) sex, race, ethnicity, baseline age, baseline weight, baseline 
height, baseline  BMI,  baseline ppFEV 1, baseline SwCl,  and baseline score of CFQ- R respiratory 
domain.  
Medical  history will be summarized  by MedDRA  System  Organ Class (SOC)  and PT for the 
OL-FAS.  
No statistical  tests will be carried  out to evaluate any baseline  imbalance  between  treatment 
groups.  
12.3.2.3  Prior  and Concomitant  Medications  
Medications  will be coded using the World  Health  Organization- Drug  Dictionary  and 
categorized as follows:  
• Prior  medication: any medication  that was administered  during the 56 days before  the first 
dose of study drug in the open- label study  
• Concomitant medication:  medication  continued or newly  received  during the TE Period  in 
the open- label study  
• Post-treatment  medication: medication  continued or newly  received  after the TE Period  in 
the open- label study  
A given medication may be classified as a prior medication, a concomitant medication, or a 
post-treatment medication; both prior  and concomitant;  both concomitant  and post-treatment; or 
prior, concomitant, and post -treatment. If a medication has a missing or partially missing 
start/end  date or time and if it cannot  be determined  whether  it was taken  before  initial  dosing in 
Protocol  VX17 -445-105, Version  5.0 Page  42 of 58 
Vertex  Pharmaceuticals  Incorporated  Confidential  Information   
  
the open- label  study, concomitantly during the TE Period  in the open- label study, or  beyond the 
TE Period  in the open -label  study, it  will be  considered  in all 3 categories of  prior,  concomitant, 
and post -treatment medication.  
Prior medications  and concomitant  medications  will be summarized  descriptively  by Preferred 
Name based on the OL -FAS. Post -treatment medications will be provided separately in an 
individual subject data listing.  
12.3.2.4  Study Drug Exposure and Compliance  
Study drug exposure  will be summarized  for the OL-SS in terms  of treatment a subject  received 
in the open -label study (in days), defined as the last day of study drug in the open- label  
study minus  the first day of study drug in the open- label  study  plus 1, regardless of study drug 
interruption.  
Study drug compliance will be  summarized overall  and by treatment  group  based on the 
OL-FAS, and will be calculated as: 100 ×  [1- (total number of days of study drug interruption in 
the open- label study) / (duration of study drug exposure in days in the open- label study)]. A 
study drug interruption  on a given day is defined  as an interruption of any study drug on that day. 
In addition, percentage of tablets taken in the open- label study  will also be summarized overall 
and by treatment  group based  on the OL-FAS,  and will be calculated  as 100 ×  [(total number  of 
tablets dispensed in the open- label study) – (total number of tablets returned in the open -label 
study)] / (total number of tablets planned to be taken per day × duration of study drug exposure 
in days for the open- label study).  
12.3.2.5  Important  Protocol  Deviations  
An important protocol deviation (IPD) is a deviation that may significantly affect the 
completeness,  accuracy, or  reliability  of the study  data or that may significantly  affect a  subject’ s 
rights, safety, or well -being. The rules for identifying an IPD in the open -label study will be 
described in the SAP.  
All IPDs  will be provided in an individual  subject  data listing,  and summarized,  as appropriate.  
12.3.3  Efficacy and Pharmacodynamic Analyses  
The secondary objectives of  the study  are the evaluation of the long- term efficacy  and PD of 
VX-445 in TC with TEZ/IVA. 
12.3.3.1  Analysis of Primary  Variables  
Not applicable  since efficacy  and pharmacodynamics  are not primary  objectives.  
12.3.3.2  Analysis of Secondary Variables 
The secondary  variables  include:  
• Absolute  change  from  baseline  in ppFEV 1 
One of the secondary efficacy  endpoints  is the absolute  change  from baseline in ppFEV 1 at visits 
in the open -label study, for subjects who receive at least 1 dose of study drug in the open- label 
study. The primary analysis for this secondary endpoint will be based on a mixed -effects model 
for repeated  measures (MMRM)  for each individual  parent  study, with the absolute  change  from 
baseline in ppFEV 1 as the dependent variable for visits in the open -label study. 
Protocol  VX17 -445-105, Version  5.0 Page  43 of 58 
Vertex  Pharmaceuticals  Incorporated  Confidential  Information   
  
The details  including sensitivity  analyses and supportive  analysis will  be described in  the SAP.  
• Absolute  change  from  baseline  in SwCl  
Analysis  of this PD variable  will be based  on an MMRM model  similar to the analysis  of the 
absolute change from baseline in ppFEV 1. 
• Number  of PEx  
The analysis of the number of PEx starting from the first dose of TC in the parent/open -label 
study will be performed  using a negative  binomial  regression  model  for each individual  parent 
study, unless otherwise specified.  
• Time -to-first PEx 
Time -to-first PEx is defined as the number of days starting from the first dose of TC in the 
parent/open- label  study to the first event  of PEx.  Note  that for patients  who were  randomized to 
placebo or TEZ/IVA group, the first dose of TC will occur in the open- label study. A subject 
who does  not experience an exacerbation prior to the  end of  the Efficacy  Analysis Period in the 
open- label study will be considered censored at the end of the Efficacy Analysis Period. The 
Kaplan -Meier method will be used to produce a graphical presentation of the cumulative 
exacerbation -free survival rate.  
• Absolute  change from  baseline in  BMI  
Analysis  of this variable  will be based  on an MMRM  model  similar  to the analysis  of the 
absolute change from baseline in ppFEV 1. 
• Absolute  change  from  baseline in  BMI  z-score 
Analysis  of this variable will be based  on an MMRM  model  similar to the analysis  of the 
absolute change from baseline in ppFEV 1. 
• Absolute  change  from  baseline in  body  weight  
Analysis  for this variable will be based  on an MMRM  model  similar  to the analysis  of the 
absolute change from baseline in ppFEV 1. 
• Absolute  change  from  baseline  in CFQ -R respiratory  domain  score 
Analysis  of this variable will be based  on an MMRM  model  similar  to the analysis  of the 
absolute change from baseline in ppFEV 1. 
12.3.3.3  Analysis of Other  Variables  
Other  variables  include:  
• Absolute  change  from  baseline  in CFQ -R non-respiratory  domain  scores  
Analysis  of this variable  will be based  on an MMRM  model  similar  to the analysis  of the 
absolute change from baseline in ppFEV 1. 
12.3.3.4  Multiplicity  Adjustment

12.3.4  Safety Analysis  
The primary  objective  of the study is the evaluation of the long-term safety  and tolerability  of 
VX-445 in TC with TEZ/IVA. All safety analyses will be based on the TE Period in the  
open- label  study for subjects in the OL -SS. 
The overall  long- term safety  profile  of study drug will be assessed  in terms of  the following 
safety and tolerability endpoints:  
• Incidence of treatment -emergent  adverse events  (TEAEs)  
• Clinical laboratory  values  (i.e., serum  chemistry,  hematology, coagulation, and urinalysis) 
• ECGs  
• Vital signs  
• Pulse oximetry  
In general, long- term safety  analysis  will be performed  in a pooled fashion. 
All safety data will be presented in individual subject data listings.  
Only  a descriptive analysis  of safety  data will be performed.  
12.3.4.1  Adverse Events  
For analysis  purposes, AEs will be classified  as pretreatment  AEs,  TEAEs,  or post-treatment 
AEs, defined as follows:  
• Pretreatment  AE: any AE that occurred  since the end of the TE Period  in the parent  study 
and before the first dose of VX -445/TEZ/IVA in the TE Period in the open- label study  
• TEAE:  any AE that worsened  (either in severity  or seriousness)  or newly  developed at or 
after the first dose date of VX -445/TEZ/IVA in the TE Period in the open- label study  
• Post-treatment  AE: any AE that worsened  (either in severity  or seriousness)  or newly 
developed after the TE Period in the open- label study  
For AEs with missing  or partial start dates,  if there  is no clear  evidence  that the AEs started 
before or after study drug treatment, then the AEs will be classified as TEAEs.  
AE summary  tables will be presented for  TEAEs  only and will include  the following:  
• All TEAEs  
• TEAEs  by strongest relationship  
• TEAEs  by maximum  severity  
• TEAEs  leading to treatment  discontinuation  
• TEAEs  leading to treatment  interruption  
• Serious  TEAEs  
• TEAEs  leading to death  
• Grade  3 and Grade  4 TEAEs

Vertex  Pharmaceuticals  Incorporated  Confidential  Information   
  
• Frequently reported TEAEs  
Summaries will be presented by  MedDRA SOC and PT using frequency counts and percentages 
(i.e., number and percentage of subjects with an event). When summarizing the number and 
percentage of subjects with an event, subjects with multiple occurrences of the same AE or a continuing AE will be counted once, only the maximum severity level will be presented in the severity summaries, and the strongest relationship level in the relationship summaries. An AE overview  table  will be provided. In addition, a listing  containing  individual  subject  level  AE data 
for all deaths and other serious and significant AEs will be provided separately. All AEs, including pre - and post -treatment AEs, will be presented in individual subject data listings.  
Exposure -adjusted  event  rates may also be provided.  
12.3.4.2  Clinical  Laboratory Assessments  
For the treatment -emergent laboratory measurements, the observed values and change from 
baseline values  of the continuous  laboratory  parameters will be summarized  in SI units  for the 
pooled population at each time point during the TE Period in the open- label study.  
The number  and percentage of subjects  with at least 1 threshold analysis event  during the 
TE Period  in the open- label  study will be summarized.  The shift of the threshold  analysis  criteria 
from baseline to post -baseline will also be summarized for selected laboratory parameters. The 
threshold analysis and parameter selection criteria will be provided in the SAP.  
Results of urinalysis  and pregnancy tests will be listed  in individual  subject  data listings  only. In 
addition, a listing containing individual subject laboratory assessment values will be provided. This listing will include data from scheduled and unscheduled time points.  
Additional  safety  laboratory  data analyses may be described in the  SAP.  
12.3.4.3  Electrocardiogram

baseline values  will be provided at each time point during the TE  Period in the open- label study, 
for the following standard digital ECG interval measurements (in msec): RR, PR, QT, QTc for heart rate (HR) interval (QTcF), QRS duration, and HR (beats per minute).  
The number  and percentage of subjects  with at least 1 threshold analysis event  during the 
TE Period  in the open- label  study will be summarized.  The threshold  analysis  criteria  will be 
provided in the SAP.  
Additional  ECG analyses may be described in  the SAP.  
12.3.4.4  Vital Signs  
For the treatment -emergent vital signs measurements, the observed values and change from 
baseline values  will be summarized  at each time point  during  the TE Period  in the open- label 
study. The following vital signs parameters will be summarized: systolic and diastolic blood 
pressure (mm Hg), body temperature ( °C), pulse rate (beats per minute), and respiratory  rate 
(breaths per minute).  
The number  and percentage of subjects  with at least 1 threshold analysis event  during the 
TE Period  in the open- label  study will be summarized.  The threshold  analysis  criteria  will be 
provided in the SAP.

Details of this analysis  will be provided  in a separate document. 
12.3.6  Interim  and IDMC Analyses  
12.3.6.1  Interim  Analysis  
Interim analyses may take place at any time at the discretion of the sponsor. In the event that a parent study is still ongoing, a limited Vertex team may be unblinded to the treatment assignments  of the parent studies for the purpose  of reviewing  the interim  results,  and will not be 
involved in or influence the conduct of the remaining part of the parent study to protect the integrity of the parent study.  
12.3.6.2  IDMC  Analysis  
The IDMC (Section  9.1.6)  will conduct  regular  safety  reviews of study data as outlined  in the 
IDMC charter.  
The IDMC’s  objectives,  responsibilities,  and operational  details  will be defined in a separate 
document (IDMC charter), which will be finalized before the first subject is enrolled in the study.  
12.4 Clinical  Pharmacology Analysis  
For the  PK analysis, trough concentrations of VX -445, TEZ, and IVA may be summarized using 
descriptive  statistics.  Trough concentrations  may also be analyzed  with prior  study PK data using 
nonlinear mixed- effects modeling, as data allow. A detailed description of the planned PK 
analysis will be presented in the CPAP.

13 PROCEDURAL,  ETHICAL,  REGULATORY,  AND ADMINISTRATIVE 
CONSIDERATIONS  
13.1 Adverse Event  and Serious Adverse Event  Documentation,  Severity 
Grading, and Reporting 
13.1.1  Adverse Events  
13.1.1.1  Definition  of an Adverse Event  
An AE is defined as any untoward medical  occurrence in a subject  during the study;  the event 
does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment. This includes any newly 
occurring event or worsening of a pre -existing condition (e.g., increase in its severity or 
frequency) after the ICF is signed.  
An AE is considered  serious  if it meets  the definition  in Section  13.1.2.1 . 
13.1.1.2  Clinically  Significant  Assessments  
Study assessments including laboratory tests, ECGs, PEs, and vital signs will be assessed and those deemed to have clinically- significant worsening from baseline will be documented as an 
AE. When  possible,  a clinical  diagnosis  for the study assessment  will be provided, rather than the 
abnormal test result alone (e.g., urinary tract infection, anemia). In the absence of a diagnosis,  
the abnormal study assessment itself will be listed as the AE (e.g., bacteria in urine or decreased hemoglobin). 
An abnormal  study assessment  is considered  clinically  significant  if the subject  has 1 or more  of 
the following: 
• Concomitant  signs  or symptoms  related  to the abnormal  study  assessment  
• Further  diagnostic  testing  or medical/surgical  intervention  
• A change  in the  dose of study drug or discontinuation from the  study  
Repeat testing to determine whether the result is abnormal, in the absence of any of the above 
criteria,  does not necessarily  meet  clinically  significant  criteria.  The determination  of whether  the 
study assessment results are clinically significant will be made by the investigator.  
A laboratory  value  that is Grade  4 will not automatically  be an SAE.  A Grade  4 laboratory value 
will be an SAE if the subject’s clinical status indicates a life -threatening AE.  
13.1.1.3  Documentation of Adverse Events  
All AEs will be collected  from the time the ICF is signed until the subject  completes  study 
participation, as defined in Section 9.1.5. 
All subjects will be queried, using nonleading  questions, about  the occurrence  of AEs at each 
study visit. When possible, a constellation of signs and/or symptoms will be identified as  
1 overall event or diagnosis. All AEs for enrolled subjects will be recorded in the CRF and 
source document. AEs for subjects who are screened but not subsequently enrolled in the study will be recorded  only in the subject’s  source  documents.  The following data will be documented 
for each AE:  
• Description  of the event  
Protocol  VX17 -445-105, Version  5.0 Page  48 of 58 
Vertex  Pharmaceuticals  Incorporated  Confidential  Information   
  
• Classification  of “serious” or “nonserious”  
• Date  of first occurrence and date of  resolution (if applicable)  
• Severity  
• Causal  relationship  to study  drug(s)  
• Action  taken  
• Outcome  
• Concomitant  medication  or other  treatment given 
13.1.1.4  Adverse Event  Severity 
The in vestigator will determine and record the severity of all serious and nonserious AEs. The 
guidance  available at the following  website will be consulted:  Common Terminology  Criteria  for 
Adverse Events (CTCAE), Version 4.0, Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program, 
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm  (Accessed  
28 September 2017). AEs of CTCAE Grades 4 and 5 will be documented as “life -threatening.” 
In considering the severity of an AE in a pediatric subject, the investigator will consider that reference ranges for pediatric clinical laboratory parameters may differ from those given in the CTCAE.  The severity  of an AE that does not appear  in the CTCAE  will be determined  according 
to the definitions in Table 13- 1. 
Table  13-1 Grading  of AE Severity  
Classification  Definition  
 
Mild (Grade 1)  Mild level of discomfort and does not interfere with regular activities 
Moderate (Grade 2)  Moderate  level  of discomfort  and significantly  interferes  with regular  activities 
Severe (Grade 3)  Significant level of discomfort and prevents regular activities  
Life-threatening 
(Grade 4)  Any adverse  drug event  that places  the subject,  in the view  of the investigator,  at 
immediate risk of death  
 
 
13.1.1.5  Adverse Event  Causality  
Every  effort will be made  by the investigator  to assess the relationship  of the AE, if any, to the 
study drug(s). Causality will be classified using the categories presented in Table 13- 2. 
Protocol  VX17 -445-105, Version  5.0 Page  49 of 58 
Vertex  Pharmaceuticals  Incorporated  Confidential  Information   
  
 
Table  13-2 Classifications  for AE Causality  
Classification  Definition  
 
Related  There is an association between the event and the administration of investigational 
study drug, a plausible mechanism for the event to be related to the investigational study  drug and causes  other  than the investigational  study  drug have  been  ruled  out, 
and/or the event reappeared on re -exposure to the investigational study drug.  
Possibly related  There is an association between the event and the administration of the 
investigational  study  drug and there  is a plausible  mechanism  for the event  to be 
related to investigational study drug, but there may also be alternative etiology, 
such as characteristics of the subject’s clinical status or underlying disease.  
Unlikely related  The event  is unlikely  to be related  to the investigational  study  drug and likely  to be 
related to factors other than investigational study drug.  
Not related  The event  is related  to an etiology  other  than the investigational  study  drug (the 
alternative etiology will be documented in the study subject’s medical record).  
 
 
13.1.1.6  Study Drug  Action Taken  
The investigator will classify  the study  drug action taken  with regard  to the AE. The action  taken 
will be classified according to the categories shown in Table 13 -3. 
Table  13-3 Classifications  for Study  Drug  Action  Taken  With  Regard  to an AE  
Classification  Definition  
 
Dose  not changed  Study  drug dose not changed  in response  to an AE 
Dose  reduced  Study  drug dose reduced  in response  to an AE 
Drug  interrupted  Study  drug administration  interrupted in response  to an AE 
Drug  withdrawn  Study drug administration  permanently discontinued in response  to an AE 
Not applicable  Action  taken  regarding  study drug administration  does not apply.  
“Not applicable” will be used in  circumstances such as when the investigational 
treatment  had been  completed  before  the AE began and no opportunity  to decide 
whether to continue, interrupt, or withdraw treatment is possible.  
 
 
13.1.1.7  Adverse Event  Outcome  
An AE will be followed until the investigator  has determined  and provided the final outcome. 
The outcome will be classified according to the categories shown in Table 13- 4. 
Protocol  VX17 -445-105, Version  5.0 Page  50 of 58 
Vertex  Pharmaceuticals  Incorporated  Confidential  Information   
  
 
Table  13-4 Classifications  for Outcome  of an AE 
Classification  Definition  
 
Recovered/resolved  Resolution  of an AE with no residual  signs  or symptoms  
Recovered/resolved  with 
sequelae  
Not recovered/not 
resolved  (continuing)  Resolution  of an AE with residual  signs  or symptoms  
 
Either  incomplete  improvement or no improvement  of an AE, such that it remains 
ongoing  
Fatal  Outcome  of an AE is death.  “Fatal” will  be used when  death  is at least possibly 
related to the AE.  
Unknown  Outcome  of an AE is not known  (e.g.,  a subject  lost to follow -up) 
 
13.1.1.8  Treatment  Given  
The investigator ensures adequate medical care is provided to subjects for any AEs, including 
clinically significant laboratory values related to study drug. In addition, the investigator will describe whether any treatment was given for the AE. “Yes” is used if any treatment was given in response  to an AE, and may include  treatments  such as other  medications,  surgery, or physi cal 
therapy. “No” indicates the absence of any kind of treatment for an AE. 
13.1.2  Serious Adverse Events  
13.1.2.1  Definition  of a Serious Adverse Event  
An SAE is any  AE that  meets any of the following  outcomes:  
• Fatal (death, regardless of cause, that occurs during participation in the study or occurs after participation  in the study and is suspected  of being  a delayed  toxicity  due to administration  of 
the study drug)  
• Life-threatening, such that the subject  was at immediate  risk of death  from  the reaction  as it 
occurred  
• Inpatient  hospitalization  or prolongation of hospitalization  
• Persistent  or significant  disability/incapacity  (disability  is defined as a substantial  disruption 
of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions)  
• Congenital anomaly or birth defect  
• Important medical event that, based upon appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize the 
subject or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent 1 of the outcomes listed above  (e.g., an allergic  bronchospasm  requiring intensive  treatment in an emergency  room  or 
at home)  
If a subject has a hospitalization or procedure (e.g., surgery) for an event or condition that occurred before the subject signed the ICF, and the hospitalization or procedure was planned before the subject signed the ICF, the hospitalization or procedure will not be considered to indicate  an SAE,  unless  an AE caused  the hospitalization  or procedure  to be rescheduled  sooner 
or to be prolonged relative to what was planned. In addition, hospitalizations clearly not associated with an AE (e.g., social hospitalization for purposes of respite care) will not be considered to indicate an SAE.  
Protocol  VX17 -445-105, Version  5.0 Page  51 of 58 
Vertex  Pharmaceuticals  Incorporated  Confidential  Information   
  
Clarification will be made between the terms “serious” and “severe” because they are not 
synonymous. The term “severe” is often used to describe the intensity (severity) of a specific event, as in mild,  moderate, or severe myocardial  infarction. The event  itself,  however, may be 
of relatively minor medical significance, such as a severe headache. This is not the same as “serious,” which is based on subject/event outcome or action described above, and is usually associated with events that pose a threat to a subject’s life or functioning. Seriousness, not severity, serves as a guide for defining expedited regulatory reporting obligations.  
13.1.2.2  Documentation of Serious Adverse Events  
All SAEs  that occur after obtaining  informed consent through completion of  study participation, 
regardless of causality, will be reported by  the investigator to Vertex GPS. In addition, all SAEs 
that occur  after  completion  of study participation  and are considered  related  to study drug(s)  will 
be reported to Vertex GPS within 24 hours . 
SAEs will be recorded on the Vertex Organized Safety Information Collection Form (hereafter 
referred to as the “SAE Form”) using a recognized medical term or diagnosis that accurately 
reflects the event. SAEs  will be assessed  by the investigator for relationship to the investigational 
study drug(s) and possible etiologies. On the SAE Form, relationship to study drug(s) will be assessed only as related (includes possibly related) or not related (includes unlikely related), and severity assessment will not be required. For the purposes of study analysis, if the event has not resolved at the end of the study reporting  period, it will be documented as ongoing. For purposes 
of regulatory safety monitoring, the investigator is required to follow the event to resolution and report to Vertex the outcome of the event using the SAE Form. 
13.1.2.3  Reporting Serious Adverse Events  
The investigator is responsible for notifying  the sponsor within 24 hours of  identifying an SAE, 
regardless  of the presumed  relationship  to the investigational  study drug. The SAE  Form  will be 
completed for new/initial events as well as to report follow -up information on previously 
reported events. Investigators are asked to report follow -up information as soon as it becomes 
available to ensure timely reporting to health authorities.  
Please send completed  SAE  Forms  to Vertex  GPS via: 
Email: globalpatientsafety@vrtx.com  (preferred  choice) 
Fax: +1 -617-341-6159  
For questions, contact  telephone:  +1-617-341-6677  
13.1.2.4  Expedited Reporting and Investigator  Safety Letters  
Vertex, as study sponsor, is responsible for reporting suspected, unexpected, serious adverse reactions (SUSARs) involving the study drug(s) to all regulatory authorities, IECs, and participating investigators in accordance with ICH Guidelines and/or local regulatory requirements,  as applicable. In addition, Vertex,  or authorized designee, will be responsible  for 
the submission of safety letters to central IECs.  
It is the responsibility  of the investigator  or designee to promptly notify the local IRB/local IEC 
of all unexpected serious adverse drug reactions involving risk to human subjects.

13.2 Administrative Requirements  
13.2.1  Ethical  Considerations  
The study will b e conducted in accordance with the current ICH GCP guidelines, which are 
consistent with the ethical principles founded in the Declaration of Helsinki, and in accordance 
with local applicable laws and regulations. The IRB/IEC will review all appropriate study documentation to safeguard  the rights,  safety, and well -being  of the subjects.  The study  will only 
be conducted at sites where IRB/IEC approval has been obtained. The protocol, Investigator’s 
Brochure, sample ICF, advertisements (if applicable), written information given to the subjects 
(including diary cards), safety updates, annual progress reports, and any revisions to these 
documents will be provided to the IRB/IEC by the investigator or Vertex, as allowable by local applicable laws and regulations.  
13.2.2  Subject  Information and Informed Consent  
After the study has been fully explained, written informed consent will be obtained from the 
subject or legal representative or guardian (if applicable), and assent will be obtained from the 
subject (if applicable), before study  participation. The method of obtaining and documenting the 
informed consent and assent (if applicable) and the contents of the consent will comply with ICH GCP  and all  applicable  laws and regulations  and will be subject  to approval  by Vertex or  its 
designee. When determining the age of the subject, other study eligibility criteria, and timing of collection  applicable  assessments,  the informed  consent  will be used as the reference  (e.g., age at 
time of informed consent, date of informed consent, timing of AE collection).  
13.2.3  Investigator  Compliance  
No modifications to the protocol will be made without the approval of both the investigator and Vertex.  Changes  that significantly  affect  the safety  of the subjects,  the scope of the investigation, 
or the scientific quality of the study (i.e., efficacy  assessments)  will require IRB/IEC  notification 
before implementation, except where the modification is necessary to eliminate an apparent immediate hazard to human subjects. Vertex will submit all protocol modifications to the required regulatory authorities.  
When  circumstances require an immediate  departure  from procedures  set forth  in the protocol, 
the investigator  will contact  Vertex  to discuss the  planned course of  action.  If possible,  contact 
will be  made  before  the implementation  of any changes.  Any  departures  from  the protocol  will 
be fully documented in the source documentation and in a protocol deviation log. 
13.2.4  Access to Records 
The investigator will make the office and/or hospital records of subjects enrolled in this study available for inspection by Vertex or its representative at the time of each monitoring visit and for audits. The records will also be available for direct inspection, verification, and copying, as required by applicable laws and regulations, by officials of the regulatory health authorities  
(FDA and others).  The investigator will comply  with applicable privacy and security  laws for use 
and disclosure of information related to the research set forth in this protocol.  
13.2.5  Subject  Privacy  
To maintain  subject  confidentiality and to comply with applicable  data protection and privacy 
laws and regulations, all CRFs, study reports, and communications relating to the study will identify subjects by assigned subject numbers and access to subject names linked to such

13.3 Data  Quality  Assurance  
Vertex  or its designated representative will conduct  a study site visit to verify  the qualifications 
of each investigator, inspect clinical study site facilities, and inform the investigator of 
responsibilities and procedures for ensuring adequate and correct study documentation. 
The investigator is required to prepare and maintain adequate and accurate case histories 
designed to record all observations and other data pertinent to the study for each study participant. Study data for each enrolled subject will be entered into a CRF by study site personnel  using a secure,  validated, web-based  electronic  data capture  (EDC)  application. Vertex 
will have read -only access to site- entered clinical data in the EDC application.  
Instances  of missing,  discrepant,  or uninterpretable  data will be  queried with  the investigator  for 
resolution.  Any changes  to study data will be  made  to the CRF  and documented in an audit  trail, 
which will be maintained within the clinical database.  
13.4 Monitoring  
Monitoring and auditing procedures developed or approved by Vertex will be followed to comply with GCP guidelines. On- site checking of the CRFs/SAE Forms for completeness and 
clarity,  cross -checking  with source documents, and clarification  of administrative  matters  will be 
performed.  
The study will be monitored  by Vertex or  its designee.  Monitoring will be done  by personal 
visits  from a representative  of Vertex,  or designee (study site monitor),  who will review  the 
CRFs/SAE Forms and source documents. The study site monitor will ensure that the investigation is conducted according to the protocol design and regulatory requirements.  
Protocol  deviations  will be monitored and identified  throughout  study conduct  as outlined in the 
Protocol Deviation Plan.  
13.5 Electronic Data  Capture  
Vertex  will provide  the study sites with secure  access to and training  on the EDC  application 
sufficient to permit study site personnel to enter or correct information in the CRFs on the subjects for which they are responsible.  
A CRF  will be completed  for each enrolled study  subject. It  is the investigator’s  responsibility  to 
ensure the accuracy, completeness, clarity, and timeliness of the data reported in the subject’s CRF. Source documentation supporting the CRF data will indicate the subject’s participation in the study and will document the dates and details of study procedures, AEs, other observations, and subject status.  
The investigator,  or designated  representative,  will complete  the CRF  as soon as possible  after 
information is collected.  
The audit  trail entry  will show  the user’s identification  information  and the date and time of any 
correction. The investigator will provide formal approval of all the information in the CRFs, including any changes  made  to the CRFs,  to endorse  the final submitted  data for the subjects  for 
whom the investigator is responsible.  
Vertex  will retain  the CRF  data and  corresponding audit  trails.  A copy of the final archival  CRF 
in the form of a compact disc or other electronic media will be placed in the investigator’s  
study file.

Summary  of Changes to Cystic Fibrosis Clinical  Study Protocols  
Vertex is currently  evaluating several CFTR modulators in clinical studies for the treatment of 
cystic fibrosis  (CF),  a serious and life-threatening  disease.  In completed  studies, treatment with 
these CFTR modulators has generally resulted in rapid, robust, clinically meaningful, and 
statistically significant improvements in clinical measures, and are generally safe and well tolerated.  Adverse events (AEs)  seen with these treatments  are mostly  consistent  with common 
manifestations of CF disease or with common illnesses in CF subjects.  
During this COVID -19 pandemic, the safety of the subjects, investigators, and site personnel 
participating in these clinical studies is Vertex’s first priority, thus it is important to minimize  
any unnecessary risk to COVID-19 exposure through travel to study sites. This addendum summarizes the measures taken for ongoing CF clinical studies. These operational adjustments were implemented to align with Health Authority guidance ensuring the protection of subjects, investigators,  and site personnel while  maintaining  compliance with GCP  and minimizing  impact 
to the integrity of the studies. Overall, the benefit -risk of these studies remains favorable.  
Vertex recommends that subjects and sites refer to local guidance regarding travel restrictions. There  are no operational changes  to the study protocols for subjects who can travel to the study 
sites for their visits. However, to ensure continued safety of subjects who cannot travel to the 
study sites for their visits (for any reason due to COVID- 19), specific alternative measures are 
being implemented to minimize the risk of exposure to COVID-19 (see table below). As the COVID-19 pandemic evolves, Vertex will continue to assess the need for additional actions to ensure the safety of all involved in these clinical studies.  
Addendum Version  3.0 summarizes  additional measures  taken  for these  ongoing CF clinical 
studies (see table below) to ensure continued safety.

Pharmacyclics, Inc. Proprietary and Confidential 4 Part 2 
Primary Objective: 
• To determine the efficacy of ibrutinib and lenalidomide in 
combination with DA-EPOCH-R in relapsed or refractory ABC DLBCL subjects as assessed by overall response rate (ORR) 
Secondary Objectives: 
• To determine the efficacy of ibrutinib and lenalidomide in combination with DA-EPOCH-R in relapsed or refractory ABC DLBCL as assessed by progression-free survival (PFS), duration of 
response (DOR) and overall survival (OS) 
• To determine the safety and tolerability of ibrutinib and lenalidomide in combination with DA-EPOCH-R in subjects with ABC DLBCL 
Exploratory Objectives: 
• To determine the pharmacokinetics (PK) of ibrutinib when dosed with lenalidomide in combination with DA-EPOCH-R  
• To evaluate biomarkers of sensitivity or resistance to ibrutinib and lenalidomide in combination with DA-EPOCH-R 
Study Design: This is a Phase 1b, open-label, non-randomized multicenter study conducted in 2 parts.  In Parts 1 and 2, treatment will be administered in 3-week (21-day) cycles.  A standard 3+3 design will be employed in Part 1 to determine the MTD, which will then define the dose to be used in Part 2.   
Part 1
:  
The dose-escalation part of the study, Part 1, will determine the MTD of the 
combination of ibrutinib, lenalidomide and DA-EPOCH-R in subjects with DLBCL.  Ibrutinib will be administered at a fixed dose of 560 mg and lenalidomide will be dose-escalated at doses of 0, 15, 20 and 25 mg for 7 days of each 21-day cycle.  DA-EPOCH-R will be given on Days 1–5 of 
each 21-day cycle at standard doses.   
The dose escalation will follow a 3+3 design with 3 subjects in each cohort.  
Cohort dose escalation will occur if the subject incidence of DLTs during the first 22 days of study treatment is < 33%.  If one subject within the initial 
cohort of 3 subjects (dose Level 1) experiences a DLT, an additional 3 subjects may be enrolled at the same dose level.  If the initial dose is safe 
and tolerable with no further DLTs, th e next dose level examined will be 
dose level 2.  Dose escalation will continue to dose Level 4.  The MTD will 
be defined as the highest dose level with an observed incidence of DLTs in <33% of the subjects enrolled in the cohort.  If in dose Level 4 DLTs occur in <33% of subjects, than the MTD will not be identified.  A dose de-
escalation of ibrutinib will be permitte d from dose Level 1 to dose Level -1 
if required based on the number of DLTs.

A DLT (Dose-Limiting Toxicity) is defined as an Adverse Event (AE) that 
occurs within the first 22 days (Cycle 1, Cycle 2 Day 1 predose) of dosing that meets the DLT definition, is clini cally relevant, and considered at least 
possibly related to study drug (ibrutinib  and/or lenalidomide) in the opinion 
of the investigator. 
 
Part 2
: 
For Part 2, the MTD determined in Part 1 will be the dose used for all 
subjects.  If no MTD is identified, then subjects in Part 2 will be treated with 
the maximum administered doses (MAD, treatment doses from dose 
Level 4).   
The expansion part of the study, Part 2, will only enroll subjects with 
non-GCB DLBCL.  The primary objective is to determine the ORR of ibrutinib and lenalidomide in combination with DA-EPOCH-R in subjects with ABC DLBCL (a subset of non-GCB DLBCL) as analyzed by gene expression profiling. 
Approximately 26 subjects will receive ibrutinib at a fixed dose of 560 mg 
and lenalidomide at the established MTD for 7 days.  DA-EPOCH-R will be 
given on Days 1–5 of each 3-week (21-day) cycle at standard doses.

Pharmacyclics, Inc. Proprietary and Confidential 6 Subjects in Part 1 and Part 2 will receive therapy until a maximum of six 
cycles or disease progression, whichever occurs first.  Subjects will be restaged after Cycle 3 (Cycle 4 Day 1, -4 days [Cycle 3 Day 19 to Cycle 4 Day 1]) and after Cycle 6 (Cycle 6 Day 21±4 days) of treatment, and then every 3, 4, and 6 months (every 12, 16 and 26 weeks) during post-treatment 
years 1, 2, and 3, respectively.   
In this study, immunohistochemisty (IH C) will be performed in Part 1 and 
Part 2; however IHC will be used to assess subject eligibility with respect to 
subtype of DLBCL only for Part 2.  Gene expression profile (GEP) will be 
performed in Part 2 to confirm the ABC subtype for analysis purposes.  
The limitations of IHC allow only a distinction between subjects as either non-GCB or GCB phenotype since within the non-GCB group one may include subjects with a true unclassified  (intermediate) subtype.  With GEP, 
the subjects can be further categorized into the following subtypes:  ABC, GCB, unclassified, and unknown due to  tissue limitations.  Throughout the 
protocol, description of enrolled subjects as “non-GCB” is based on IHC 
testing used at screening.  The use of the term “ABC subtype” refers to 
subjects who have been subsequently (ie, after starting protocol treatment) profiled by GEP and then classified as the true ABC subtype.   
Population Subjects with relapsed or refractory DLBCL who have failed at least 1 prior line of therapy.  In Part 1, a minimum of 4 and a maximum of 30 DLBCL subjects will be enrolled.  In Part 2, 26 relapsed or refractory de novo DLBCL subjects with non-GCB subtype will be enrolled.  Enrollment may 
be increased to include 26 subjects with confirmed ABC DLBCL depending 
on data availability.  S ubjects with ABC subtype from Part 1 that received 
the MTD or MAD of lenalidomide may be carried over to Part 2.

The study will expand to N=26 relapsed or refractory de novo DLBCL subjects in Part 2, which will provide 81% power when comparing an ORR of 60% versus 85% with 1-sided alpha level 5% by exact test.  Enrollment 
may be increased to include 26 subjects with confirmed ABC DLBCL 
depending on data availability.   
The primary endpoint (ORR) will be reported including an exact 1-sided 
95% confidence interval.  The seconda ry efficacy endpoints (DOR, PFS, 
and OS) will be summarized by Kapl an-Meier analyses with estimated 
means, medians and ranges reported in months.  The secondary safety endpoints will be summarized by incidences and types of clinical AEs. 
The final analysis will occur approximately 1 year after the last subject 
received the first dose.  Analyses methods will be detailed in the Statistical Analysis Plan.

1.1. Overall Summary 
Treatment for relapsed and refractory diffu se large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) remains 
challenging.  Following initia l therapy, re-induction chemot herapy followed by high-dose 
therapy with autologous stem ce ll support (HDT/ASCT) remains the current 
standard of care.  
For patients not eligible for stem cell transplant, per NCCN guidelines, a variety of therapies are 
recommended.  However, the overall outcome is relatively poor, with a worse prognosis in the 
non-GCB subtype including pati ents with ABC DLBCL.  Based on this information, new 
therapies are needed, particularly for non-transp lant eligible subjects with the ABC subtype. 
DA-EPOCH-R (dose-adjusted cyclophosphami de, doxorubicin, etoposide, vincristine, 
prednisone +/- rituximab) is one of the recommended therapies for relapsed DLBCL per NCCN 
guidelines.  Preclinical and clin ical data for lenalidomide, a nother recommended therapy in the 
relapsed setting, implies it is equally efficacious or perhaps even more efficacious in patients 
with ABC DLBCL ( Yang 2012, Hernandez-Ilizaliturri 2011, Wang 2013 ).  Similarly, clinical 
data with ibrutinib also implies greater activity in the ABC subtype ( de Vos 2013).  Since 
accepted therapy for relapsed DLBCL consists of DA-EPOCH-R, we hypothesize that the 
addition of ibrutinib and lenalidomide may furt her enhance the response to chemotherapy in 
patients with non-GCB (ABC) DLBCL which will be tested in Part 2 of this study.  Synergistic activity may also be seen in other forms of DLBCL (ie, tr ansformed, primary mediastinal, 
germinal center B cell-like [GCB]) which will be tested in a limited number of patients in Part 1. 
1.2. Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma (DLBCL) 
Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is th e most common of the aggressive non-Hodgkin 
lymphomas (NHL) in the United Stat es, with an annual incidence th at has been rising gradually 
since the 1990s (Fisher 2004 ).  The estimated 2010 prevalence of NHL in the US was 
approxim
ately 509,000 individuals, with over 200,000 of  these cases in individuals over the age 
of 70 years ( SEER 2010 ).  It is estimated that 30-40% of NHL cases are of the DLBCL category 
(Hans 2004).  According to the current SEER data, the median age at diagnosis is 67 years 
(SEER 2010).  While approximately half of the incremental rise in incidence of DLBCL is 
attributable to identifiable factors, such  as the increase in the incidence of human 
immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-related DLBCL, th e evolution of more specific diagnostic 
techniques, and revisions in lymphoma classifi cation schemes, much of the rising incidence 
remains unexplained ( Holford 1992).  A very aggressive maligna ncy in its untreated natural 
history, DLBCL is a potentially curable disease, with a significant propor tion of patients cured 
with modern chemoimmunotherapy.  Nonetheless, fo r those patients not cure d by standard initial 
therapy, the prognosis remains generally poor ( Gisselbrecht 2010 ) and DLBCL still accounts for 
the highest number of deaths per year of all the NHL histologies.

Pharmacyclics, Inc. Proprietary and Confidential 22 Treatment for relapsed and refractory DLBCL re mains challenging.  Following initial therapy, 
the approach of re-induction chemothera py followed by high-dose chemotherapy with 
HDT/ASCT for responding patients remains the current standard of care.  For patients that are 
not eligible for stem cell therapy, per NCCN gui delines, a variety of th erapies are recommended 
for second line treatment.  These include DA-EPOCH +/- rituximab ( Jermann 2004; 
Wilson 2008), CEPP (cyclophosphamide, etoposide, prednisone, procarbazine) +/- rituximab 
(Chao 1990), CEOP (cyclophosphamide, etoposide, vi ncristine, prednisone) +/- rituximab 
(Bartlett 2001 ; Moccia 2009 ), GDP (gemcitabine, dexamethas one, cisplatin) +/- rituximab 
(Crump 2004), GemOx (gemcitabine, oxaliplatin) +/- rituximab ( Lopez 2008 ; Corazzelli 2009; 
El Gnaoui 2007), Bendamustine +/- rituximab ( Ohmachi 2013 ; Weidmann 2002; Rigacci 2012 ), 
Lenalidomide +/- rituximab ( Wiernik 2008; Witzig 2011) and rituximab single-agent therapy 
(Robach 2002).  Despite a number of therapeutic options, the overall outcome remains poor, 
with a worse prognosis in non-GCB subjects including the ABC subtype.  Therefore new 
treatement regimens are needed.  
DA-EPOCH-R (a recommended therapy per NCCN guidelines) was chosen for this study to be 
used in combination with ibrutinib and lenalido mide.  The activity of DA-EPOCH in previously 
untreated subjects with DLBCL was demonstr ated in a study with 50 DLBCL subjects 
(Wilson 2002).  A complete response (CR) was s een in 92% of patients (Wilson 2002).  
The median follow-up time was 62 months, and progression-free surviv al (PFS) was 70% and 
overall survival (OS) was 73% (Wilson 2002).  The use of DA-EPOCH in subjects with relapsed 
or refractory DLBCL and mantle -cell lymphoma (MCL) was demons trated in another study with 
50 subjects ( Jermann 2004).  The median number of prior chemotherapy regimens was 
1.7 (range one to four).  Twenty-five subjects  had primary DLBCL, 18 had transformed DLBCL 
and 7 had MCL.  The overall response rate (ORR)  was 68% (28% CR, 40% PR), median OS was 
17.9 months and the projected OS at 1, 2 and 3 years was 66, 42 and 35%, respectively.  Median 
PFS was 11.8 months; projected PFS at 1, 2 and 3 years was 50, 30 and 26%, respectively.   
The efficacy of EPOCH in subjects with re lapsed and resistant lymphomas was further 
demonstrated in a study with 131 subjects ( Gutierrez 2000 ).  This study included 86 patients 
(68%) with DLBCL.  One hundred and thirty-one patients were assessable for toxicity and 
125 patients were assessable for response.  Among 125 assessable patients, 93 (74%) achieved 
objective responses, including 30 (24%) complete  and 63 (50%) partial responses.  Patients 
generally had a poor prognosis w ith high-intermediate or high  International Prognostic Index 
(IPI) scores in 46%.  All patient s were extensively pretreated having received a median (range) 
of 8 (1-17) different drugs and 1 (1-5) or 2 (1-7) regimens, respectively, if they had aggressive or 
indolent histologies.  Of the drugs present in the EPOCH regimen, 57% of patients had received 
all 5 and 88% had received at l east 4 of the agents.  All but 4 (6%) patients had previously 
received doxorubicin.  To help assess if the infusional schedule increased efficacy, the response 
to EPOCH in patients who showed no response to their last combination regimen (ie. resistant 
disease) was analyzed.  In th is group of 42 patients, 57% resp onded to EPOCH.  Among patients 
with chemotherapy-sensitive disease, 83% re sponded with 33% CRs (Gutierrez 2000).  EPOCH 
can also be administered to patients who have  received prior anthracyclines because it has low

Adding rituximab to DA-EPOCH also showed promising clinical outcome in 72 patients with 
untreated de novo DLBCL ( Wilson 2008) .  Taken together, DA-EPOC H-R provides an excellent 
salvage regimen to assess targeted agents and can be  administered to previously untreated as well 
as relapsed and refractor y lymphoma patients.  
DLBCL gene expression profiling reveals 3 mo lecular subtypes: activated B cell-like (ABC), 
germinal center-like (GCB) and primary medias tinal (PMBL).  The ABC subtype accounts for 
~30% of cases of DLBCL and has an inferior prognosis.  Chronic active BCR signaling is a pathogenic mechanism in ABC DLBCL and this chronic activation engages the classic NF- κB 
pathway.  In contrast, GCB DLBCL pat hogenesis is independent of the NF- κB pathway 
(Lenz 2010 ).  This difference in the molecular mech anism of pathogenesis may explain why the 
ABC subtype is less sensitive to chemotherapy and remains less curable than the GCB subtype.  Thus, new strategies for the ABC subtype are ne eded.  Importantly, pre-clinical studies imply 
synergy when ibrutinib and lenalidomide are co mbined predominantly but not exclusively in 
lymphoma cell lines of the ABC subtype.   
Previous clinical studies with ibrutinib have shown benefit in the ABC subtype ( de Vos 2013 ), 
as have trials with lenalidomide (Hernandez-Ilizaliturri 2011).   The clinical outcome of the 
combination of ibrutinib and lenalidomide in DLBCL currently remains unknown.  Since 
patients with DLBCL can be salvaged with DA- EPOCH-R, we hypothesize that the addition of 
ibrutinib and lenalidomide may further enhance re sponse, and warrants tes ting in both GCB and 
non-GCB subtypes of DLBCL.   
1.3. Ibrutinib Background 
Ibrutinib is a first-in-class, potent, orally 
administered covalently-bindi ng inhibitor of Bruton’s 
tyrosine kinase (BTK).  Inhibition of BTK bl ocks downstream B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling 
pathways and thus prevents B-ce ll proliferation.  In vitro, ibrutinib inhib its purified BTK and 
selected members of the kinase family with 10-fo ld specificity compared with non-BTK kinases.  
Ibrutinib (IMBRUVICA®) is approved by the U.S. Food a nd Drug Administration (FDA) for the 
treatment of: 1) mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) in patients who have received at least one prior 
therapy based on overall response rate, 2) chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) in patients who 
have received at least one prior therapy, and 3)  CLL in patients with 17p deletion. Ibrutinib is 
currently under investigati on in various indications. 
B-cells are lymphocytes with multiple functions in the immune response, including antigen 
presentation, antibody production, and cytokine  release.  B-cells express cell surface 
immunoglobulins comprising the BCR, which is activated by binding to antigen.  Antigen 
binding induces receptor aggregation and the cl ustering and activation of multiple tyrosine 
kinases, which in turn activate further downstream signaling pathways ( Bishop 2003).  
The process of B-cell matura tion, including immunoglobulin chai n rearrangement and somatic 
mutation, is tightly regulated.  It is thought that B-cell ly mphomas and CLL result from 
Ibrutinib (PCI-32765)  Protocol PCYC-1124-CA - Amendment 1 
IND 102,688   30 September 2014 
Pharmacyclics, Inc. Proprietary and Confidential 24 mutations and translocations acquire d during normal B-cell development ( Shaffer 2002 ).  
Several lines of evidence sugge st that signaling th rough the BCR is necessary to sustain the 
viability of B-cell malignancies. 
The role of BTK in BCR signal transducti on is demonstrated by the human genetic 
immunodeficiency disease X-linked agammaglo bulinemia and the mouse genetic disease 
X-linked immunodeficiency, both caus ed by a mutation in the BTK gene.  These genetic diseases 
are characterized by reduced BCR si gnaling and a failure to genera te mature B-cells.  The BTK 
protein is expressed in most hematopoietic cells with the excepti on of T-cells and natural killer 
cells, but the selective effect of  BTK mutations suggests that its primary functional role is in 
antigen receptor signaling in B-cells (Satterthwaite 2000 ). 
Data from Study PCYC-04753 demonstrate that a lthough ibrutinib is rapidly eliminated from 
the plasma after oral administration, once daily dosing with ibrutinib is  adequate to sustain 
maximal pharmacodynamic activity fo r 24 hours postdose at dose levels ≥2.5 mg/kg.  
In Study PCYC-04753, the BTK occupancies in PBMCs for the 2.5 mg/kg/day to 
12.5 mg/kg/day cohorts and for the 560 mg c ontinuous dosing cohort, were all above 90% 
at either 4 or 24 hours after drug administration.  In addition, because of an expected 
tissue-to-plasma concentration ratio of 50% in more distant compartments, such as 
blood-forming organs (bone marrow, spleen, and lymph node) and lymphoid tumor tissue 
(based on ratio data in the range  of 0.44 to 0.67 observed in rats),  it is reasonable to expect full 
BTK occupancy in these tissues at doses of 5 mg/kg and above. 
Ibrutinib has demonstrated single agent activity in the treatment of relapsed or refractory de novo 
DLBCL in Study PCYC-1106-CA.  Study PCYC- 1106-CA is an ongoing Phase 2, open-label, 
nonrandomized, multicenter study in patients with relapsed or refractory de novo DLBCL 
receiving 560 mg/day of ibrutinib.  Data are curr ently available on 70 patients from this trial who 
have relapsed or refractory disease with 29 ABC subtype, 20 GCB subtyp e, 16 Type 3 subtype 
and 5 subjects subtype unknown.  The ORR in these 70 patients was 25% (17/70) with 9% of patients achieving a complete response (CR) a nd 16% of patients achieving a partial response 
(PR).  Of the patients with ABC subtype, the ORR was 41% (12/29) with 17% CR and 24% PR.  
Of the patients with GCB subtype the ORR was 5% (1/20) with the one responder achieving a 
PR.  The median OS was 9.76 months for thos e with ABC subtype and 3.35 months for those 
with GCB subtype ( de Vos 2013 ).

1.4. Lenalidomide Background 
The immunomodulating drug lenalidomide (IMiD compound, CC-5013, Celgene)  is a structural 
and functional analogue of thalidomide. 
 The second generation of IMiD compounds were 
designed to enhance immunologic and anti-cance r properties while poten tially decreasing the 
Ibrutinib (PCI-32765)  Protocol PCYC-1124-CA - Amendment 1 
IND 102,688   30 September 2014 
Pharmacyclics, Inc. Proprietary and Confidential 25 neurotoxic and teratogenic adverse eff ects of the parent compound thalidomide ( Barlett 2004 ).  
These drugs have been extensively used and have shown clear benef it in other diseases, 
particularly multiple myeloma and myelodysplastic syndromes.  Lenalidomide has been reported 
to down-regulate key prosurvival cytoki nes such as tumor necrosis factor- α (TNF-α), 
interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-8 (IL-8), a nd vascular endothelial gr owth factor (VEGF) 
(Corral 1999 ).  Other immunomodulatory activities of IMiDs include inhibition of T-regulatory 
cell function ( Galustian 2009 ) and potent T-cell co-stimulatory  activity, leading to increased 
secretion of the T-cell ly mphokines interferon (IFN)- γ, and IL-2.  This enhances Th1-type 
cellular immunity and natu ral killer (NK) T-cell cy totoxicity (Corral 1999, LeBlanc 2004 , 
Chang 2006, Davies 2001).  IMiDs have also demonstrated direct antiproliferative effects by 
inhibiting the Akt pathway and increasing the expression of the p21 tumor suppressor protein, 
leading to G1 cell cycle arrest (Dredge 2005, Gandhi 2006), as well as its inhibition of 
angiogenesis ( Lentzsch 2003 ).  As described above, lenalid omide has specific activity against 
ABC DLBCL that appears related to its effect  on Type I interferon and the NF-kB pathway.  
A Phase 2 study (NCI study NHL-002) of 50 patients with relapsed or refractory aggressive 
NHL showed moderate single-agent activity with lenalidomide.  The study included patients with DLBCL, follicular lymphoma (FL), MCL, and transformed NHL.  Lenalidomide (25 mg/d) 
was administered on Days 1 to 21, every 28 days for 52 weeks as tolerated or until disease 
progression.  The ORR was 35% for all patients,  19% for DLBCL patients and 53% in MCL.  
Clinical responses were also observed in all lymphoma subtypes.  The main adverse event (AE) was hematologic, severe neut ropenia being the most common  reason for dose reduction.  
The results from this study suggest that lena lidomide has potentially important activity in 
aggressive lymphoma ( Wiernik 2008).  Based on these results, an international Phase 2 trial 
(NHL-003) of single-agent lenalidomide was initia ted for patients with relapsed/refractory 
aggressive NHL.  The preliminary results from  the 39 MCL and 73 DLBCL patients enrolled in 
this study were recently reported.  The ORR in pa tients with MCL was 41%, with five patients 
(13%) achieving CR/CRu and eleven  (28%) reaching PR.  The res ponse rate was slightly lower 
in patients with DLBCL, with an ORR of  29%, with 3 patients (4%) achieving CR and 
18 patients (25%) achieving PR. Eleven patients (15%) had stable disease.  The drug was well 
tolerated with a manageable toxicity prof ile, similar to that observed in NHL-002.  
These preliminary results further validate the ro le of lenalidomide in the treatment of patients 
with relapsed or refractory DLBCL and MCL (Zinzani 2008 , Czuczman 2008). 
A retrospective analysis was pe rformed on 3 different studies evaluating the use of lenalidomide 
alone or in combination with rituximab or dexamethasone for th e treatment of NHL.  The final 
reported analysis was on 40 patie nts that received lenalidomid e monotherapy for treatment of 
DLBCL, with an ORR of 27.5%.  The outcomes were also reported based upon DLBCL subtype.  
Of the patients with ABC subtype (n=17), th e ORR was 53% with 29.4% CR and 23.5% PR, and 
a median PFS of 6.2 months.  For those patients  with the GCB subtype (n=23), the ORR was 9% 
with 1 CR and 1 PR and a median PFS of 1.7 m onths.  The OS for both groups was similar 
at 
14 months and 13.5 mont hs respectively ( Hernandez-Iliz aliturri 2011 ).  Another Phase 2 study

Pharmacyclics, Inc. Proprietary and Confidential 26 (N=45) evaluated the safety and efficacy of lenalidomide in combination with rituximab in 
relapsed or refractory NHL ( Wang 2013).  For the included DLBCL patients (n=32), the ORR 
was 28% with a CR rate of 22% and a median  PFS of 2.8 months and OS of 10.2 months.  
There were no significant differe nces in clinical responses by  DLBCL subtype (Wang 2013).   
1.5. Combination of Ibrutinib and Lena lidomide in ABC Subtype of DLBCL 
The ABC subtype of DLBCL has constitutive NF-kB activation.  The NF-kB pathway is 
activated by chronic active BCR signaling and can be additionally activated by certain mutations. 
Combined use of functional and structural ge nomics has revealed the molecular 
basis for 
constitutive NF-kB activation in ABC DLBCL.   In response to BCR engagement by antigen, 
the signaling adapter CARD11 coordinates the activ ation of IkB kinase (IKK), the key regulatory 
kinase of the NF-kB pathway ( Thome 2010 ).  CARD11 is more hi ghly expressed in ABC 
DLBCL than in other lymphoma subtypes and is continuously re quired for NF-kB activity and 
viability of ABC DLBCL cell lines ( Ngo 2006).  In approximately 10% of ABC DLBCLs, 
CARD11 acquires activating mutations in its coiled-coil domain, lead ing to spontaneous 
aggregation of the mutant isoform, ther eby activating IKK and the NF-kB pathway ( Lenz 2008 ).  
In other DLBCLs, upstream signaling from the BCR engages wild type CARD11 to activate the 
pathway, a phenomenon termed chronic active BCR signaling ( Davis 2010 ).  More than 20% of 
ABC DLBCL tumors have mutations in the CD79A and CD79B subunits of the BCR that augment BCR signaling to NF-kB, establishing th e pathogenetic importance of this pathway for 
ABC DLBCL (Davis 2010). 
MYD88 is the key signaling adapter in toll-like receptor signaling ( Ngo 2011).  During innate 
immune responses to microorganisms, toll-like re ceptors bind to pathogen-associated molecular 
patterns, leading to the recrui tment of a signaling complex com posed of MYD88 and the kinases 
IRAK1 and IRAK4, ultimately engaging the NF-kB, MA P kinase and type I interferon pathways.  
In ABC DLBCL cell lines, knockdown of MYD88 is lethal due to inhibition of NF-kB and the 
loss of autocrine IL-6/IL-10 signaling through JAK kinase and STAT3 (Ngo 2011, Lam 2008).   
Based on the NF-kB signaling pathway, as explorat ory analyses in ABC DLBCL, this study aims 
to analyze the mutations of CARD11, CD79A , CD79B, and MYD88 and perform correlations 
with clinical outcome.  By affecting different ta rgets involving the B-cell receptor and the NF-kB 
activation pathway, ibrutinib and lenalidomide are expected to have a synergistic effect in 
chronically activated ABC subtype tumor cells.  In summary, adding ibrutinib and lenalidomide to a regimen of  DA-EPOCH-R is expected to 
improve the overall clinical outcome in subjects with relapsed and refractory DLBCL, especially 
in the ABC subtype.  Based upon the safety prof ile of ibrutinib monothe rapy and the lack of 
significant myelosuppression, the combination of lenalidomide and ibrutinib may be well 
tolerated with the potential to exploit synergisti c effects for improvement in outcomes in a frail 
population with minimal therapeuti c options and a poor prognosis.

1.6.1. Nonclinical Pharmacology Studies 
Ibrutinib was designed as a select ive covalent inhibitor of 
BTK (Pan 2007) and in vitro is a 
potent inhibitor of  BTK activity (IC 50 = 0.39 nM).  The irreversible  binding of ibrutinib to 
cysteine-481 in the active site of BTK results in sustained inhibition of  BTK catalytic activity 
and enhanced selectivity over other kinases that do  not contain a cysteine at this position.  When 
added directly to human whole blood, ibrutinib inhibits signal transduction from the B-cell 
receptor and blocks prim ary B-cell activation (IC 50 = 80 nM) as assayed by anti-IgM stimulation 
followed by CD69 expression (Herman 2011 ).  Ibrutinib arrested cell growth and induced 
apoptosis in human B-cell lympho ma cell lines in vitro and inhi bited tumor growth in vivo in 
xenograft models (Herman 2011).  Ib rutinib also inhibited adhesi on and migration of MCL cells 
in co-culture and reduced tumo r burden in lymph node and bone marrow in a murine model of 
MCL dissemination and progression ( Chang 2013a , Chang 2013b).  Therefore, ibrutinib may 
also disrupt key interactions w ith the tumor microenvironment.

toxicology, please refer to the current IB. 
1.6.2. Toxicology Studies 
In safety pharmacology assessments, no treatment -related effects were ob served in the central 
nervous system or respiratory system in rats at  any dose tested.  Furthe r, no treatment-related 
corrected Q
T interval (QTc) prolongation e ffect was observed at any tested dose in a 
cardiovascular study using tele metry-monitored dogs.   
Based on data from the rat and dog including gene ral toxicity studies up to 13 weeks duration, 
the greatest potential fo r human toxicity with ibrutinib is predicted to be in lymphoid tissues 
(lymphoid depletion) and in the gastrointestinal tract (soft fe ces/diarrhea with  or without 
inflammation).  Additional toxicity findings se en in only one species with no observed human 
correlate in clinical studies to date include pancreatic aci nar cell atrophy (rat), minimally 
decreased trabecular and corti cal bone (rat) and corneal dystr ophy (dog).  Relative to a human 
dose of 560 mg/day and the no-observed-adverse-e ffect-level (NOAEL) in 13-week studies in 
animals, the maximum concentration (C max)-based safety margins were 3.7 to 8.4 for male and 
female rats, respectively and 0.9 to 2.7 for fema le and male dogs, respectively.  The area under 
the curve (AUC)-based safety margin ratios for the 560 mg/day human dose and the NOAEL in animals were 2.6 to 20.3 for male and female rats, respectively and 0.4 to 1.7 for female and 
male dogs, respectively.  
In vitro and in vivo genetic toxi city studies showed that ibruti nib is not genotoxic.  In a rat 
embryo-fetal toxicity study, ibrutinib admini stration was associated with fetal loss and 
malformations (teratogenicity).  The NOAEL for effects on embryo/fetal development was 
10 mg/kg/day (human equivalent dos e [HED] = 1.6 mg/kg/day).

1.7. Summary of Clinical Studies for Ibrutinib 
Ibrutinib is under late-stage development as an or ally admi
nistered antica ncer agent with lead 
indications in the relapsed/ref ractory setting and in treatment-naïve patients with B-cell 
malignancies as a single agent.  Combination studies with chemoimmunotherapy and 
immunotherapy have been initiated.  There ar e 20 ongoing and 4 completed company-sponsored 
clinical studies of ibru tinib.  Across all studies, malignancies under investigation include CLL, 
SLL, MCL, DLBCL, FL, MM, and Waldenstrom’ s Macroglobulinemia (WM).  As of the data 
cutoff of 06 April 2013, safety data are availa ble for 736 subjects tr eated with ibrutinib: 
506 subjects receiving ibrutinib monotherapy; 100 healt hy subjects in the pharmacokinetic 
(PK)/clinical pharmacology studies; and 130 subject s receiving ibrutinib in combination with 
1 or more marketed chemo/imm unotherapeutic agents.  In add ition, approximately 537 subjects 
have been treated with ibrutinib or placebo in 5 randomized, controlled tr ials.  In Study PCYC-
1103-CA, a rollover extension study, 196 subjects continue to be  treated with ibrutinib. 
1.7.1. Summary of Clinical Pharmacokinetics 
Following oral administration 
of ibrutinib at doses ranging from 1.25 to 12.5 mg/kg/day as well 
as fixed dose levels of 420, 560, and 840 mg/day, exposure to ibrutinib increased as doses 
increased with substantial intersubject variability.  The mean half-life (t 1/2) of ibrutinib across 
3 clinical studies ranged from 4 to 10 hour s, with a median time to maximum plasma 
concentration (T max) of 2 hours.  Administration of 420 mg ibrutinib with a high-fat breakfast in 
subjects with CLL approximately doubled the mean  systemic exposure compared to intake after 
overnight fasting with median time to T max delayed from 2 to 4 hours.  Ibrutinib was extensively 
metabolized to the dihydrodiol metabolite PCI-4 5227, a reversible inhibitor of BTK, with 
approximately 15 times lower inhibitory potency  compared to ibrutinib.  The metabolite-to-
parent AUC ratio ranged from 0.7 to 3.4.  Stea dy-state exposure of ibrutinib and PCI-45227 was 
less than 2-fold of first dose exposure. 
Ibrutinib is minimally cleared renally.  Th e results of a human mass balance study of 
[14C]-ibrutinib conducted in six healthy male subjects demonstrated that less than 10% of the 
total dose of [14C]-ibrutinib is renally excreted, wher eas approximately 80% is recovered in 
feces.  No specific clinical studies have been  conducted in subjects w ith renal impairment.  
In Study PCYC-1102-CA, subjects with mild and moderate renal insufficiency (creatinine 
clearance >30 mL/min) were enrolled.  No dose adju stment is needed for subjects with mild or 
moderate renal impairment (greater than 30 mL/min creatinine clearance) in this study.  There is 
no data in patients with severe renal impairment or  subjects on dialysis.  The study of ibrutinib in 
hepatic impaired subjects is currently in progress.

Pharmacyclics, Inc. Proprietary and Confidential 29 Ibrutinib is primarily metabolized by cytochrome  P450 (CYP) 3A.  Concomitant use of ibrutinib 
and drugs that inhibit CYP3A can increase ib rutinib exposure.  Co-administration of 
ketoconazole, a strong CYP3A inhibitor, in 18 healthy subjects, increased dose normalized 
exposure (C max and AUC 0-last) of ibrutinib by 29- and 24-fold, respectively.  However, 
in 38 cancer subjects treated with mild and/or moderate CYP3A inhibitors, the ibrutinib exposure (AUC) was ≤ 2-fold the upper limit of the range of 76 patients not treated concomitantly with 
CYP3A inhibitors.  Clinical safety data in patie nts treated with weak, m oderate or strong CYP3A 
inhibitors did not reveal meaningful increases in toxicities.   
Administration of ibrutinib with  strong inducers of CYP3A can decrease ibrutinib plasma 
concentrations.  Physiologically  based PK modeling and simula tion indicates that rifampin, 
a strong inducer, can cause a 10-fold decrease in ibrutinib exposure. 
The risks associated with ibrutinib and the dihydrodiol metabolite PCI-45227 as potentially 
affecting the clearance of R-CHOP were assesse d in subjects with CD20-Positive B-Cell NHL in 
Study PCI-32765DBL1002.  Vincristine pharmacokine tics were evaluated since CYP3A has 
been shown to be relevant for vincristine’s system ic clearance.  No indications for an effect of 
ibrutinib dosed at 560 mg on vincristine pharmacoki netics were apparent.  For the other CHOP 
compounds, which are not substrates of CYP3A, clin ical drug-drug interac tion with ibrutinib is 
much less likely to occur.  Regarding the e ffect of concomitant medication on ibrutinib 
pharmacokinetic behavior, preliminary pharmac okinetic data for ibrutinib and metabolite 
PCI-45227 from Study PCI-32765DBL1002 were compar ed with exposure data derived from 
PCYC-1104-CA, an ibrutinib monotherapy study in subjects with MCL.  Co-administration of 
R-CHOP and ibrutinib did not a ffect ibrutinib exposures in a clinically meaningful way.  
These data are relevant since seve ral of the agents used in the C HOP regimen are similar to that 
of DA-EPOCH.

Pharmacyclics, Inc. Proprietary and Confidential 31 1.7.3. Risks 
1.7.3.1. Bleeding-related Events 
There have been reports of hemorrhagic 
events in subjects treated with ibrutinib both with and 
without thrombocytopenia.  Th ese include primarily minor hemorrhagic events such as 
contusion, epistaxis and petechi ae; and major hemorrhagic events  including gast rointestinal 
bleeding, intracranial hemorrh age and hematuria.   
1.7.3.2. Cardiac 
Atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter have been reported in subjects treated with ibrutinib, particularly 
in subjects with cardiac risk factors, acute infecti ons, and a previous history of atrial fibrillation.  
In particular subjects with a history of cardiac arrhythmias should be monitored closely. 
1.7.3.3. Cytopenias 
Treatment-em
ergent Grade 3 or 4 cytopenias (neu tropenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia) were 
reported in subjects treat ed with ibrutinib. 
1.7.3.4. Diarrhea 
Approximately one-third of subjects treated with ibrutinib monotherapy and two-thirds treated with 
combination therapy reported diarrhea.  Other frequently reported gastrointestinal events include 
nausea, vomiting, and constipation.  These events are rarely severe, with only a small number of 
Grade 3 events, and no Grade 4 events reported to date.  
1.7.3.5. Infections 
Fatal and non-fatal infections ha ve occurred with ib rutinib therapy.  At least 25% of subjects 
with MCL and 35% of subjects with CLL had Gr ade 3 or greater inf ections per NCI Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE).
  The most commonly reported infections 
include pneumonia, cellulitis, urin ary tract infection and sepsis.  Isolated cases of JC virus 
reactivation resulting in progressive multifocal  leukoencephalopathy (PML) have been observed 
and resulted in death.  Two cases in relapsed  CLL subjects have been reported.  One case 
occurred after multiple prior rituximab regimens and less than one year after the last dose of 
rituximab and high dose steroid administration.  The second cas e occurred during concomitant 
administration of rituximab, bendamustine and ibrutinib. 
1.7.3.6. Other Malignancies 
Other malignancies, m
ost frequently skin cancers, have occurred in subjects treated with 
ibrutinib.  Across the MCL (PCYC-1104-CA) and CLL/SLL studies  (PCYC-1112-CA and 
PCYC-1102-CA), skin cancers a nd non-skin cancers were repo rted in 5.0% (18/357) and 2.5% 
(9/357) of subjects who receiv ed ibrutinib, respectively.

IND 102,688   30 September 2014 
Pharmacyclics, Inc. Proprietary and Confidential 32 1.7.3.7. Rash 
Rash has been commonly reported in subjects treated with either single agend ibrutinib or in 
comb
ination with chemotherapy.  In a randomized  Phase 3 study (PCYC-112-CA), rash occurred 
at a higher rate in the ibrutinib arm than in the control arm.  Most rashes  were mild to moderate 
in severity.  One case of Stevens-Johnson Syndrom e (SJS), with a fatal ou tcome, was reported in 
a subject with CLL.  The subject received ibrutin ib (420 mg/day) and was also receiving various 
antibiotics and antigou t medication (allopurinol) known to  be associated with SJS. 
1.7.3.8. Treatment-related Lymphocytosis 
Similar to other agents targeting BCR signaling, transient lymphocytosis is a pharmacodynami
c 
effect of ibrutinib, in which th e inhibition of BTK-mediated ce llular homing and adhesion results 
in a mobilization of tumor cel ls to the peripheral blood ( Stevenson 2011). 
Upon initiation of treatment, a transient phase of increase in ly mphocyte counts (ie, ≥50% 
increase from baseline and above absolute count  5000/µL), often associat ed with reduction of 
lymphadenopathy, has been observed in most s ubjects (75%) with relapsed/refractory CLL/SLL 
treated with ibrutinib.  This effect has also  been observed in some subjects (33%) with 
relapsed/refractory MCL treated with ibrutinib.  This observed transient lymphocytosis is usually 
not associated with an AE and should not be cons idered progressive disease (PD) in the absence 
of other clinical findings.  In both disease types, lymphocytosis typically occurs during the first 
few weeks of ibrutinib therapy (median time 1.1 weeks) and resolves within a median of 
7.1 weeks in the MCL and 18.7 w eeks in the CLL subjects. 
A substantial increase in the number of circulating lymphocytes (eg, >400,000/µL) has been observed in a subset of subjects.  There have be en isolated cases of leukostasis reported in 
subjects treated with ibrutinib. 
1.7.3.9. R-CHOP with Ibrutinib 
Many of the chemotherapeutic agents used in the R-CHOP regimen are also used in 
DA-EPOCH-R.  Relevant to this, ibrutinib has been evaluated in a Phase 1b study com
bining 
ibrutinib with R-CHOP in patients with CD20-positive B-Cell NHL ( Younes 2013 ).  Patients 
received an oral daily dose of ibrutinib (280, 420, or 560 mg) in combination with standard doses 
of R-CHOP (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxo rubicin, and vincristine on Day 1, and 
prednisone on Days 1 through 5 of each 21-day cycle for up to 6 cycles).  The primary objective was to determine the recommended Phase 2 dose of ibrutinib in combination with standard 
R-CHOP.  The secondary objectives were to assess safety, ORR, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamic biomarkers. 
Seventeen patients (7, 4, and 6 receiving increas ing ibrutinib doses) were enrolled: 59% male, 
median age 65 (Range 46–81) years, 47% DLBCL, 29% MCL and 24% FL.  In the 280 mg 
cohort, 2 patients had dose-limiting toxicity (DLT): 1 with transien t syncope and 1 with 
Ibrutinib (PCI-32765)  Protocol PCYC-1124-CA - Amendment 1 
IND 102,688   30 September 2014 
Pharmacyclics, Inc. Proprietary and Confidential 33 periorbital cellulitis; at 560 mg, 1 patient had gastritis (Grade 2).  The recommended Phase 2 
dose was established at 560 mg ibrutinib.   
The most common (≥ 20% of patients) AEs were neutrope nia (77%), thrombocytopenia (65%), 
vomiting (59%), anemia (53%), nausea (47%), fatigue (35%), headach e (29%), constipation 
(24%), diarrhea (24%), and dizziness (24%).  To date, 6 patients completed 6 cycles of 
treatment, and 2 patients discontinued treatment (1 due to noncompliance with the study drug 
and 1 due to non-DLT AE).  Preliminary effi cacy assessments showed a favorable response 
(Younes 2013 ). 
Based on these studies, ibrutinib  can be safely combined with systemic chemotherapy and a 
similar regimen to DA-EPOCH-R produced promis ing results in patients with newly diagnosed 
DLBCL. 
1.8. Summary of Clinical Safety for Lenalidomide in Lymphoma 
Lenalidomide is currently approved for the treatm ent of relapsed or refractory mantle cell 
lymphoma at a recomm
ended starting dose of 25 mg orally once daily for 21 days every 28 days.  
The safety data for 134 patients receiving monothe rapy for MCL has been evaluated.  The most 
common treatment-emergent adverse events (>15%) were neutropenia (49%), thrombocytopenia 
(36%), fatigue (34%), diarrhea (31%), anemia  (31%), nausea (30%), cough (28%), pyrexia 
(23%), rash (22%), dyspnea (18%), pruritis (1 7%), constipation (16%),  and peripheral edema 
(16%).  The most common Grade 3 or 4 adverse events were hematologic in nature: neutropenia (43%), thrombocytopenia (28%), and anemia (11%).  Pneumoni a (9%) was the most frequent 
non-hematologic Grade 3/4 adverse event.   
The median duration of treatment in this patient population was 95 days (1–1002 days).  
Seventy-six patients (57%) requ ired at least one dose interru ption for an adverse event, 
while 51 patients (38%) had at least one dose re duction due to toxicit y.  Twenty-six patients 
(19%) discontinued treatmen t due to adverse events. 
Lenalidomide has a black box warning for embryo- fetal toxicity, hematologic toxicity and 
venous thromboembolism. 
1.8.1. Venous Thromboembolism 
Venous thromboembolism including deep vein th romobis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) 
has been reported in patients during treatment for NHL generally, occurring at incidences from
 
~7% up to 20% ( Zhou 2010 ; Park 2012; Lyman 2013).  In lenalidomide clinical trials, DVT and 
PE were reported in 7 (2.6%) and 6 (2.2%) of 266 subjects with relaps ed or refractory NHL 
receiving lenalidomide in clini cal studies NHL-002 and NHL-003 ( Wiernik 2008; Witzig 2011).  
Anti-thrombotic prophylaxis was not suggested  in NHL-002 but was required for subjects 
considered to be at high risk of devel oping DVT in NHL-003.  In a study evaluating 
lenalidomide plus rituximab versus lenalidomide al one in relapsed follicular lymphoma subjects, 
Ibrutinib (PCI-32765)  Protocol PCYC-1124-CA - Amendment 1 
IND 102,688   30 September 2014 
Pharmacyclics, Inc. Proprietary and Confidential 34 thrombosis was reported in 2 (4%) of the combin ation arm versus 7 (16%) in the single agent 
arm (Leonard 2012).  In an additional study evaluating lenalidomide plus rituximab in MCL 
patients 2 (5%) Grade 3 and 1 (5%) Grade 4 thromboembolic events were reported ( Wang 2013). 
1.8.2. Second New Cancers 
According to researchers, patients with cancer  have a higher risk of developing a second new 
cancer when compared to people without cancer.  In clinical studies of newly diagnosed multiple 
myelom
a, a higher number of second cancers were reported in patients treated with induction 
therapy (treatment as first step to redu cing number of cancer cells) and/or bone marrow 
transplant then lenalidomide for a long period of time compared to patients treated with 
induction therapy and/or bone marrow transplant  then placebo (a capsule containing no 
lenalidomide).  Patients should make their doc tors aware of their me dical history and any 
concerns they may have regarding their own increased risk of other cancers.  
For more complete safety information, pl ease refer to the prescribing information 
(REVLIMID™ Prescribing Information 2013 ).   
1.8.3. R-CHOP with Lenalidomide 
Lenalidomide has been evaluated in a Phase 1 study with R-CHOP ( Nowakowski 2011 ).  
Patients with newly diagnosed, untreated DLBCL or  Grade III FL were treated with standard 
doses of R-CHOP and escalating doses of lenalidom ide.  Doses were tested at 15 mg, 20 mg, and 
25 mg on Days 1–10 and no DLT was found.  The O RR rate was 100% with a CR rate of 77%.  
Lenalidomide 25 m
g was then used in a Phas e 2 study with R-CHOP in newly diagnosed 
DLBCL or FL Grade III ( Nowakowski 2012 ).  Ninety-two % (47 patients) of these patients had 
DLBCL and 60% (31 patients) had stage IV di sease.  The most common toxicities were 
hematological toxicities with Grade 3 and 4 thrombocytopenia (20% for both groups) and 
Grade 3 and 4 neutropenia (18%  and 71%, respectively).  Non- hematological toxicities in 
Grade 3 or higher were seen in 27% of patie nts and included febrile  neutropenia (10%), 
nausea (4%), urinary tract inf ection (4%), vascular access co mplication (4%) and dehydration 
(4%).  One patient developed thrombosis and on e patient died secondary to bowel perforation.  
The ORR was 98% and the CR rate was 83% , with PFS at 12 months being 73%.  
Based on these studies, lenalidomide can be safe ly combined with systemic chemotherapy and a 
similar regimen to DA-EPOCH-R produced promising results in patients with newly diagnosed 
DLBCL. 
1.9. Summary of Clinical Safety for DA-EPOCH-R Chemotherapy in Lymphoma 
A long-term follow-up study evaluated relapsed and refractory lymphoma patients, including 
86 patients (68%) with DLBCL ( Gutierrez 2000 ).  The toxicity of EPOCH was evaluated over 
535 cycles in 131 patients (Gutierr ez 2000).  A common pattern of t oxicity consisted of a brief 
neutropenia, usually less than  4 days and occurring around day 10 to 14 of treatment, and

IND 102,688   30 September 2014 
Pharmacyclics, Inc. Proprietary and Confidential 35 minimal gastrointestinal toxi city.  Thrombocytopenia below 50,000/µL occurred during 24% of 
cycles, and neutropenia occurred during 48% of cycles with hosp italization for neutropenia with 
fever during 18% of cycles.  There were 3 infecti on-related deaths.  Gastrointestinal toxicity was 
mild.  Neurological toxicity necessitating vinc ristine reduction occurred in 10% of cycles, 
despite prior vincristine exposure in most patie nts.  Cardiac toxicit y, a major limitation of 
doxorubicin, was rarely seen despite unspecified maximum allowable doxorubicin exposure 
(in 3% of patients).  A modest and clinically in significant decline in th e median ejection fraction 
(EF) over multiple cycles of EPOCH was observed; a paired t-test (p2) analysis comparing Cycle 0-1 vs. Cycle 2-3, Cycle 4-5 and Cycle 6 revealed a difference of -2.58%, (0.13); 
-5.5%, (0.0038) and -6.32%, (0.020) , respectively.  Although patient s were heavily pretreated, 
the toxicity profile of EPOCH allowed de livery of 71%, 92%, 92% and 93% of planned 
cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincrist ine and etoposide, respectively. 
1.10. Justification of Study Design and Dose Rationale  
This non-randomized, multicenter, open-label, study is designed to evaluate whether a 
comb
ination of DA-EPOCH-R, ibrutinib and lenalidomide has clinical benefit in subjects with 
relapsed or refractory DLBCL.  In Part 1 of the study, the MTD of the combination of 
DA-EPOCH-R, ibrutinib and lenalidomide will be a ssessed in relapsed or refractory DLBCL.  
In part 2 of the study, the efficacy in the ABC subtype of DLBCL will be explored.  DA-EPOCH-R is one of the recommended therap ies per NCCN guidelines for relapsed or 
refractory DLBCL not eligible for stem cell thera py.  The treatment combination of ibrutinib and 
lenalidomide may prove to be beneficial  in both the GCB and non-GCB subtypes. 
1.10.1. Dose Selection Rationale for DA-EPOCH-R 
The rationale for the current dose and sche dule of 
each agent is based not only upon the 
approved dose for these treatments, but also based upon the safety data known regarding the use 
of these therapies for the treatment of NHL in the relapsed and refractory setting.   
The doses of DA-EPOCH-R are standard doses; doses will be adjusted per ANC as previously described ( Wilson 2002).   
1.10.2. Dose Selection Rationale for Ibrutinib 
The proposed dose for ibrutinib is  560 mg PO once per day (4 x 140-mg 
capsules) administered 
from Day 1–7 in each cycle.  In the Phase 1 study PCYC-04753 in subjects with NHL, the 560 mg dose administered once daily appeared safe and favorab le responses were observed.   
Study PCYC-04753 was a first-in-human, Phase 1, dose-escalating study of ibrutinib in 
66 subjects with recurrent B-cell lymphoma including NHL, CLL, FL, MCL, and WM. 
Five sequential cohorts of subj ects received ibrutinib from 1.25 to 12.5 mg/kg/day for 28 days of 
a 35-day cycle and 2 additional cohorts received either a continuous ibrutinib dose of 8.3 mg/kg/day or a 560-mg fixed dose. 
Ibrutinib (PCI-32765)  Protocol PCYC-1124-CA - Amendment 1 
IND 102,688   30 September 2014 
Pharmacyclics, Inc. Proprietary and Confidential 36 Ibrutinib was well tolerated across a broad range of doses  (1.25 through 12.5 mg/kg/day) 
both when given intermittently and continuously  on a 35-day cycle.  The most common AEs 
(>20% of subjects) in this population were diarrhea, fatigue, cough, nausea, headache, and 
pyrexia.  AEs were generally mild to moderate (G rade 1 or 2) and readily  managed or reversible. 
There was no apparent relationship between the incidences or severity of AEs and dose or 
schedule of ibrutinib.  In addition, the maximu m tolerated dose of ibrutinib was not reached. 
Pharmacodynamic studies revealed  complete BTK active-site occupancy in PBMCs at doses of 
2.5 mg/kg and above, including the 560 mg continuous dosing cohort.  The 560 mg dose was 
chosen for this study since it was found to be acti ve in NHL not only in this Phase 1 trial, but 
also in several Phase 2 studies in patients with NHL.    
1.10.3. Dose Selection Rationale for Lenalidomide 
The established dose in monotherapy studies of lenalidomide is 25 mg 
administered orally once 
daily for 21 days on a 28-day cycle ( Witzig 2009).  Escalating doses of le nalidomide used in this 
study are 0, 15, 20 and 25 mg.  Thus, the top dose of lenalidomide tested in combination with 
DA-EPOCH-R and ibrutinib in this study is the established dose of 25 mg.

The dose-escalation part of the study, Part 1, will determine the MTD of the combination of 
ibrutinib, 
lenalidomide and DA-EP OCH-R in subjects with DLBC L.  Subjects will receive 
ibrutinib at a fixed dose of 560 mg (or 420 mg if there is toxicity asso ciated with 560 mg) and 
lenalidomide at an escalating dose of 0, 15, 20 a nd 25 mg on Days 1–7 of each 21-day cycle.  
DA-EPOCH-R will be given at standard doses on Days 1-5 of each 21-day cycle.   
The dose escalation will follow a 3+3 design with  3 subjects in each cohort.  Cohort dose 
escalation will occur if the subjec t incidence of DLTs during the first 22 days of study treatment 
is <33%.  If one subject within the initial coho rt of 3 subjects experiences a DLT, an additional 
3 subjects may be enrolled at the same dose level.  If the initial dos e is safe and tolerable with no 
further DLTs, the next dose level examined will be dose Level 2.  Dose escalation will continue

Pharmacyclics, Inc. Proprietary and Confidential 39 to dose Level 4.  The MTD will be defined as the highest dose level with an observed incidence 
of DLTs in <33% of the subjects enrolled in the cohort.  If in dose Level 4 DLTs occur in <33% 
of subjects, then the MTD will not be identifi ed and the dose Level 4 dose will be the maximum 
administered doses (MAD).   
In the event of toxicity  associated with 560 mg of ibrutinib  (DLTs during the first 22 days of 
study treatment is >33% in dose Level 1), 420 mg of ibrutinib (dose Level -1) may be used for 
the dose escalation cohorts if it is deemed safe in combination with DA-EPOCH-R.  In this case, 
a maximum of 30 subjects may be enrolled in Pa rt 1 (up to 6 subjects at the -1 level and 
4 x 6 = 24 subjects at levels 1, 2, 3 and 4). 
At the MTD or MAD, at least 6 subjects will be treated  at this level prior to start of Part 2 of the 
study.

Subjects will be monitored through all cycles of treatment for related toxicities.  Dose-limiting 
toxicities are defined in Section 5.5. 
3.4. Part 2 – Expansion 
The expansion part of the study, Part 2, will only enroll subjects with non-GCB DLBCL as 
identified by IHC.  The primary objective is to  determ
ine the ORR of ibrutinib and lenalidomide 
in combination with DA-EPOCH-R in subjec ts with ABC DLBCL as analyzed by gene 
expression profiling (GEP). 
The MTD determined in Part 1 will be the dose used for all subjects.  If no MTD is identified, 
then subjects in Part 2 will be treated with the MAD which is the treatment dose from dose Level 4.  Approximately 26 subjec ts will receive ibrutinib at a fixed dose of 560 mg (or 420 mg 
if there is toxicity a ssociated with 560 mg, see dose esca lation schema above) on Days 1–7 and 
lenalidomide at the established MTD on Days 1–7.  DA-EPOCH-R will be given on Days 1–5 of 
each 3-week (21-day) cycle at standard doses.  
Depending on the number of subjects enrolled at the MTD in Part 1 and depending on the 
number of subjects with the ABC subtype that  will be identified, additional subjects may be 
enrolled (please see sa mple size calculation).

Subjects in Part 1 and Part 2 will receive ther
apy until a maximum of six cycles or disease 
progression, whichever occurs fi rst.  Subjects will be restaged  after cycle 3 (Cycle 4 Day 1, 
-4 days [Cycle 3 Day 19 to Cycle 4 Day 1]) and after Cycle 6 (Cycle 6 Day 21 ±4 days) 
of treatment, and then every 3, 4, and 6 months (every 12, 16 and 26 weeks) during 
post-treatment years 1, 2, and 3 respectively.

IND 102,688   30 September 2014 
Pharmacyclics, Inc. Proprietary and Confidential 41 In this study, immunohistochemi sty (IHC) using Hans method ( Hans 2004) will be used to assess 
subject eligibility with respect to subtype of  DLBCL for Part 2.  GEP will be performed to 
confirm the ABC subtype for analysis purposes.  The limitations of IHC a llow only a distinction 
between subjects as either non-GCB or GCB phenotype since within the non-GCB group one 
may include subjects with a true unclassified (i ntermediate) subtype.  With GEP, the subjects can 
be further categorized into the following subtype s: ABC, GCB, unclassif ied, and unknown due to 
tissue limitations.  Throughout the protocol, descript ion of enrolled subjects as “non-GCB” is 
based on IHC testing used at screening.  The use of the term “ABC subtype” refers to subjects 
who have been subsequently profiled by GEP and then classified as the ABC subtype by GEP.  Subjects with primary mediastinal  B cell lymphoma (PMBL) are excluded in Part 2 as they can 
be erroneously identifie d by IHC as ABC DLBCL. 
Subject participation will include a Screening Phase, a Treatment Phase, and a Follow-up Phase. 
The Screening Phase will be up to 28 days prior to first dose of study drug, during which the 
subject’s eligibility and baseline characteristics will be determined. 
The Treatment Phase will extend from enrollment until study drug disconti nuation.  Subjects will 
receive treatment for up to 6 (21-day) cycles as long as the subject is de riving clinical benefit 
(complete remission [CR], partial remission [PR], or stable diseas e [SD]) or until the subject 
experiences any unacceptable toxicity, whichever o ccurs first.  Further information on dosing is 
provided in Section 5.  Regularly scheduled disease asse ssments are requir ed throughout the 
Treatment Phase (Section 8.2). 
The Post-treatment Phase will extend 
from the discontinuation of treatment 
up until the subject 
has progressive disease or other criteria listed in Section 9.  Response evaluations will be 
continued every 3, 4 and 6 months during post- treatment years 1, 2 and 3 respectively.   
Response assessments will be completed by the inve stigator using the Revised Respon
se Criteria 
for Malignant Lymphoma ( Cheson 2007).   
The Investigator will evaluate sites of diseas e by radiological imagi ng (primary), physical 
examination or other procedures as necessar y, review of hematology and serum chemistry 
results, and disease-related symp toms.  The same methods of assessment used to assess disease 
at baseline should be used thr oughout the study.  Local laboratories will perform all hematology 
and serum chemistry testing for th e primary endpoint analysis.

5.4. Dose Escalation for Part 1 
The dose-escalation part of the study, Part 1, will determine the MTD of the combination of 
ibrutinib, lenalidomide and DA-EPOCH-R in s ubjects with DLBCL.  DA-EPOCH-R will be 
given at standard doses on
 Days 1–5 of each 21-day cycle.  The dose level of lenalidomide will 
be escalated.  Subjects will r eceive ibrutinib at a fixed dos e of 560 mg PO on Days 1–7 and 
lenalidomide PO at an escalated dose of 0, 15, 20 and 25 mg for 7 days of each 21-day cycle.  The dose escalation will follow a 3+3 design with 3 subjects in each cohort.   
• The first cohort of 3 subjects will begin at Part 1 dose Level 1; if 0 of 3 subjects experience 
a DLT within the first 22 days, then the next dose level cohort (Part 1 Level 2) with 3 new 
subjects will be enrolled.   
• If 1 of 3 subjects experiences a DLT, 3 additional subjects will be enrolled at the same dose 
level for a total of  6 subjects.   
• If no additional subjects experience a DLT at that dose level, meaning that no more than 1 of 
6 subjects at the same dose level experience a DLT, then the next dose level cohort will be 
enrolled with 3 new subjects.

• Part 1 cohort 1–4 dose levels are given in the table below.   
• Dose Level 4 defines the maximum admi nistered dose (MAD) in this study. 
The MTD will be defined as the highest dose level with an observed incidence of DLTs in < 33% 
of the subjects enrolled in the c ohort.  If in dose Level 4 DLTs occur in < 33% of the subjects, 
then the MTD will not be identified.  In this case, the MAD of 25 mg lenalidomide from dose Level 4 will be the lenalidomide dose used in Part 2.

If 2 or more DLTs are seen in dose Level 1, ibrutinib may be reduced to a dose of 420 mg 
(dose Level -1).  If the 420 mg dose of ibrutinib is the MTD that can be combined with 
DA-EPOCH-R, then dose escalation of lenalidomide will proceed with dose escalation Levels 2, 
3, and 4 as outlined above. 
In Part 1, during the first 21-day cycle, lenali domide will NOT be reduced due to toxicity. 
Lenalidomide toxicity will be considered a Do se-Limiting Toxicity (DLT) during this period 
(see Section 5.5 ). 
After Cycle 1, EPOCH-R will be dose-adjusted as described below and as previously described 
(Wilson 2002).  
5.5. Dose-Limiting Toxicities for Part 1 
A DLT is defined as an Adverse Event (AE) th at occurs within the first 22 days (Cycle 1, 
Cycle 2 Day 1 predose) of dosing that meets the DLT definition belo w, is clinically relevant, and 
is considered at least possibly related to study drug (ibr utinib and/or lenali domide) in the opinion 
of the investigator. 
5.5.1. DLT Definition 
DLT 
assessments will only be conducted during 
the dose-escalation part during the first 22 days 
(Cycle 1, Cycle 2 Day 1 predose).

On Day 1, ibrutinib and lenalidomide will be admi nistered first and infusions will be started 
within 30 min of the PO doses. 
If a dose of ibrutinib is missed, it can be taken as soon as possible on the same day with a return 
to the normal schedule the following day.  No extra capsules to make up missed doses of 
ibrutinib should be taken. Ibrutinib will be dispensed to subjects in bottles.  All doses of ibrutinib ta ken in the clinic should 
be taken from the bottle dispense d to the subject.  Unused ibru tinib capsules dispensed during 
previous visits must be returned to the site and drug acc ountability records (Section 12.8) must 
be updated.  Returned capsules must not be re-d ispensed to anyone.  Subj ects should return all 
used bottles to the site when they rece ive new study drug.  For the purpose of drug 
accountability, empty bottles and returned capsule s should be kept at th e site until after the 
review of the site monitor if allowed by local institution 
policy. 
Investigators are prohibited from supplying ib rutinib capsules to any subjects not properly 
enrolled in this study or to any physicians or scientists except those designated as 
subinvestigators on Food and Drug Administratio n (FDA) Form 1572.  The investigator must 
ensure that subjects receive ib rutinib capsules only from pe rsonnel who fully understand the 
procedures for administering the drug. Treatment will continue for up to 6 cycles of treatment until disease progression or other reason 
for treatment discontinuation as outlined in Section 9.  
Dose modifications for toxicity are outlined in Section 5.6.3. 
5.6.3. Dose Reduction and Discontinuation 
Outside of the DLT window in Part 1 and in Part  2 of the study, the ibru tinib dose should be held 
for any unmanageable, potentiall y ibrutinib-related toxicity. 
Note:  During Part 1, ibrutinib may be reduced from
 560 mg to a dose of 420 mg (dose Level -1).  
If this is the case, appl
y the table below usi ng recommendations for 1 dose level lower than that 
used for 560 mg. 
Please see Section 11.2.3 for event of special interest reporting of major hemorrhage 
(Section 11.2.3.1) and intracranial hemorrhage ( Section 11.2.3.2). 
The action in Table 7 should be taken for the following ibrutinib-related  toxicities: 
• Grade 4 ANC (<500/µL) for more than 7 days.  The use of neutrophil growth factors is 
permitted per American Society of C linical Oncology (ASCO) guidelines ( Smith 2006 ) 
and must be recorded in the electronic case report form (eCRF).

Occurrence Action to be Taken 
First Withhold ibrutinib until recovery to Grade ≤1 or baseline; may restart at original dose level 
Second Withhold ibrutinib until recovery to Grade ≤1 or baseline; may restart at 1 dose level lower 
(420 mg per day) 
Third Withhold ibrutinib until recovery to Grade ≤1 or baseline; may restart at 1 dose level lower 
(280 mg per day) 
Fourth Discontinue ibrutinib 
 
An ibrutinib-related toxicity that results in a dose delay of greater than 1 week should result in a 
dose reduction as per the table above. 
At the investigator’s discretion, the dose of ib rutinib may be re-escalated after a dose reduction 
in the absence of a recurrence of the toxicity that led to the reduction. 
Please see Section 6.2.1 for guidelines for management of ibrutinib in subjects who require 
treatment

5.7. Lenalidomide 
All subjects in both parts of this study 
will receive lenalidomide and will follow guidelines for 
lenalidomide dosing and toxicity management. 5.7.1. Formulation, Packaging, and Storage of Lenalidomide   
Lenalidomide (Revlimid
®) will be supplied as capsules for oral administration by Celgene 
Corporation.   
Lenalidomide will be shipped to the pharmacy at the study site in individual bottles or blister 
packs.  Bottles or blister packs wi ll contain a sufficient number of capsules to last for 1 cycle of 
dosing.  Lenalidomide must be dispensed in the orig inal packaging with the label clearly visible.  
Only lenalidomide for 1 cycle of therapy may be provided to the subject each cycle.  
The Investigator or designee is responsible for taking an inventory of each shipment of 
lenalidomide received on the drug accountability form.   Lenalidomide should be stored at room temperat ure away from direct sunlight and protected 
from excessive heat and cold. 
5.7.2. Lenalidomide Prescribing Information (applies to US sites only) 
Lenalidomide (Revlimid
®) will be provided to research subjects for the duration of their 
participation in this study at no charge to them  or their insurance providers.  Lenalidomide will 
be provided in accordance with the Revlimid  REMS™ program of Celgene Corporation.

Please refer to Appendix F:  Risks of Fetal Exposure, Pregnancy Testing Guidelines and 
Acceptable Birth Control Methods 
5.7.4. Dosage, Preparation and Administration of Lenalidomide 
The first dose of lenalidomide will be administered 
PO on Cycle 1 Day 1 of the Treatment 
Phase, 
after which lenalidomide will be self-administered daily by the subjects on Days 1-7 of each 
cycle. 
Lenalidomide and ibrutinib which are given PO can be administered together.  On Day 1, 
ibrutinib and lenalidomide will be administered fi rst and infusions will be started within 30 min 
of the PO doses. 
Lenalidomide should be administered with water.   The capsule should be swallowed intact and 
subjects should not attempt to chew capsules,  open capsules or dissolve them in water.  
Results from human in vitro studies show that lenalidomide is neither metabolized by nor 
inhibits or induces the CYP450 pathway.  
Females of childbearing potential  should not handle or administ er lenalidomide unless they are 
wearing gloves. If a dose of lenalidomide is missed, it should be taken as soon as possible on the same day.  
If a dose is missed for th e entire day, it should not
 be made up. 
Lenalidomide dosing during the Treatment Phase occurs on Days 1–7 of each cycle.  If a Day 1 (of any cycle) is delayed due to scheduling, inst ruct the subject that lenalidomide dosing should 
not be initiated until Day 1 assessments can occur. 
Treatment will continue for up to 6 cycles of treatment until disease progression or other reason for treatment discontinuation as outlined in Section 9.  
Dose modifications for toxicity are outlined in Section 5.7.5, Table 
8, and Table 9. 
For instructions regarding drug accountability and disposal/return of unused lenalidomide please 
refer to the Pharmacy Manual. 
5.7.5. Dose Delay, Reduction or Discontinuation of Lenalidomide

Pharmacyclics, Inc. Proprietary and Confidential 53 5.7.5.2. Part 1 Cycles 2–6 and Part 2 Lenalidomide Dose Modifications 
A new course with 7-day lenalidomide treatmen t may begin on Day 1 of a new cycle if  
o ANC ≥ 1,000/µL and  
o Platelet coun
t ≥ 50,000/µL and  
o No lenalidomide-related ≥ Grade 3 toxicity  
If the criteria are not met, per investigator’s discretion, assessments may be repeated.    
The initiation of lenalidomide should be delaye d until subject meets crite ria to receive drug as 
planned.  Once a 7-day cycle has initiated, if lenalidomide must be held for toxicity during 
dosing (Day 1–7), lenalidomide will not resume until Day 1 of the next cycle, provided the 
subject meets criteria above, w ith dose adjustments as per Table 8.   
If a lenalidomide-related toxicity occurs af ter dosing between Day 8 and 21, lenalidomide may 
resume at Day 1 of the next cycle, provided the subject meets
 criteria above.  No dose 
adjustment is required if the next cycle resume s on schedule or is delayed less than 1 week.  
If the next treatment cycle is delayed more than 1 week due to  a lenalidomide-related toxicity, 
then dose adjustments should be undertaken as per  Table 9. 
Dose adjustments are to be made according to the system showing the greatest 
toxicity.  
If a patient experiences se veral toxicities and there ar e conflicting recommendations, 
the recommended dose adjustment that reduces th e dose to the lowest le vel will be used.  
The major toxic effects which limit dose are: vo miting, diarrhea, neuropathy, thrombocytopenia, 
neutropenia and anemia.  In the event a pati ent is diagnosed with a thyroid condition or 
experiences a drop in creatinine clear ance to <60 mL/min please refer to  Table 8 for further 
instructions.

Per prescribing information: 
First Infusi
on:  The rituximab solution for infusion shoul d be administered intravenously at an 
initial rate of 50 mg/hr.  Rituximab should not be mixed or diluted with other drugs. 
If hypersensitivity or infusion reactions do not occur, the infusion rate may be escalated in 
50 mg/hr increments every 30 minutes, to a maximum of 400 mg/hr.  If a hypersensitivity (non-IgE-mediated) or an infusion reaction devel ops, the infusion should be temporarily slowed 
or interrupted.  The infusion can continue at on e-half the previous rate upon improvement of 
subject symptoms. 
Subsequent Infusions:  If the subject tolerated the first infusion well, subsequent rituximab 
infusions can be administered at an initial  rate of 100 mg/hr, and increased by 100 mg/hr 
increments at 30-minute intervals, to a maximum of 400 mg/hr as tolerated.  If the subject did 
not tolerate the first infusion well, follow the guidelines for the first infusion. Some individual subjects may require close mon itoring during the firs t and all subsequent 
infusions, eg subjects who have pre-existing cardiac or pulmonary conditions, prior clinically 
significant cardiopulmonary AEs or high numbers of circulating malignant cells ( ≥25,000/mm

Pharmacyclics, Inc. Proprietary and Confidential 62 5.13. Dose Adjustment for EPOCH-R 
5.13.1. EPOCH-R Dose Adjustment for Part 1 and Part 2 
• Dose adjustments for DA-EPOCH-R are ba sed 
on twice weekly CBC obtained between 
cycles.  Nadir ANC and platelets are us ually observed between Day 10–14 and Day 11–16, 
respectively.  
• Dose adjustments above starting dose level (L evel 1) apply to et oposide, doxorubicin and 
cyclophosphamide. 
• Dose adjustments below starting dose level (L evel 1) apply to cyclophosphamide only.   
• Drug doses based on previ ous cycle ANC nadir: 
 
Table 12: EPOCH-R Dose Adjustment 
• If Nadir ANC ≥ 500/µL on all measurements: ↑ One dose level above last cycle 
• If Nadir ANC < 500/µL on 1 or 2 measurements:    Same dose level as last cycle 
• If Nadir ANC < 500/µL ≥ 3 measurements: ↓ One dose level below last cycle 
Or  
• If nadir platelet < 25,000/µL on ≥ 1 measurement: ↓ One dose level below last cycle 
 
• If ANC ≥ 1000/ μL and platelets ≥75,000/ μl on Day 22, begin treatment (even if ibrutinib 
and/or lenalidomide are withheld due to ibrutinib- or lenalidomide-related toxicity). 
• If ANC <1000/ μL or platelets <75,000/ μl on Day 22, delay up to 1 week. If EPOCH-R 
cannot be administered then ibrutinib and lena lidomide will also be delayed.  Filgrastim 
may be started for ANC <1000/ μL and stopped 24 hours before treatment.  If counts still 
low after 1 week delay, ↓ 1 dose level below last cycle.  
• Important:  Measurement of ANC nadir based on twice weekly CBC only (3 days apart, 
e.g. on Monday & Thursday or Tuesday & Friday to assure that counts are checked every 
3 to 4 days).  Only use results from twice weekly CBCs for dose adjustment, even if additional (daily) CBC’s are obtained.  Note :  Not all the CBC blood draws for the dose 
adjustment are included in the schedule of a ssessments; please draw twice weekly for the 
dose adjustment of EPOCH a nd as clinically indicated. 
• The Investigator or his designee must be consulted on all dose adjustments. 
• Note:  The Investigator may use discreti on in adjusting doses in subjects with 
compromised bone marrow function due to i nvolvement by lymphoma.  Subjects with 
severe cytopenias due to compromised marro w function from lymphoma will have repeat 
bone marrow biopsies and will only be retreated if there is evidence of tumor response.  
This judgment may be made by the inves tigator in consultation with the local 
hematopathologists.

5.13.2. Vincristine Dose Reduction for Ileus Toxicity 
Symptom
atic ileus/constipation may occur.  Because the severity of constipation is dose related, 
it is usually unnecessary to stop th e vincristine altogether.  Every effort should be made to not 
unnecessarily reduce vincristine doses.  Ileus/cons tipation is usually worse during the first cycle, 
so prophylactic bowel care is esse ntial.  If vincristine dose is reduced for this toxicity, it can 
often be increased to full dose on subsequent  cycles without recu rrence of severe 
ileus/constipation.  The following guidelines for sy mptomatic ileus on a prev ious cycle should be 
followed. 
1. Clinical ileus <8 days with abdominal pa in requiring narcotics and/or persistent 
nausea/vomiting >2 days:  Reduce vincristine dose 25%. 
2. Clinical ileus 8–12 days with abdominal pain requiring narcotics and/or persistent 
nausea/vomiting >2 days:  Redu ce vincristine dose 50%.  
3. Clinical ileus >12 days with abdominal pa in requiring narcotic s and/or persistent 
nausea/vomiting >2 days:  Hold vincristine on next cycle.  May restart at 50% reduction on 
subsequent cycle.

Etoposide should be returned to full dose (or escalated if indicated) on ce creatinine clearance 
> 50 mL/min/1.73 m2.  Data are not available in pa tients with creatinine clearance 
< 15 mL/min/1.73 m2.  Note:  Entry criteria for this  study require creatinine clearance 
≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 so this situation pertains to  renal dysfunction on treatment. 
5.13.5. EPOCH-R Dose for Obese Subjects 
All dosing is based on the pati ent’s BSA as calculated from actual 
weight without capping.  
There is no clearly documented adverse impact of  treatment of obese subjects when dosing is 
performed according to actual body weight. 
5.13.6. Pretreatment and Dose Modifications for Rituximab  
Pretreatment 
for rituximab with diphenhydram ine and acetaminophen using standard medical 
practice may be used.  Side effects of rituximab may be infusion-rate rela ted and may be reduced 
by slower administration or prem edication.  At the investigator’s discretion, rituximab may be 
discontinued for the duration of the cycles in subjects with allergic reactions and may be 
administered on the following cycles using slower infusion rates. 
At the investigator’s discre tion, the rituximab dose should be held for any unmanageable, 
potentially rituximab-related toxicity.  The dos e of rituximab should be modified according to 
the dose modification guidelines in Table 16 if any Grade 4 or unmanageable Grade 3 
non-hematologic toxicity attri buted to rituximab occurs.

Pharmacyclics, Inc. Proprietary and Confidential 65 5.14. Criteria for Permanent T reatment Discontinuation  
Investigators are encouraged to keep a subject who is experienci ng clinical benefit in the study 
unless significant toxicity puts the subject at risk or rout ine noncompliance puts the study 
outcomes at risk.  If the subject meets any of the following criter
ia, then withdrawal from the 
study treatment is mandatory: 
• Subject has confirmed PD. 
• Subject has an intercur rent illness or AE that preven ts further study drug administration. 
• Subject decides to withdraw from study. 
• Subject requires a prohibite d concomitant medication. 
• Investigator decision (such as chronic noncomplia nce, significant protoc ol deviation, or best 
interest of the subject) 
• Study termination by Sponsor 
• Subject becomes pregnant. 
Subjects who withdraw for any reason other than those specified in Section 9 will not be 
replaced.  A Safety Follow-up visit (Section 8.3.1) is required for all subjects except for those 
subjects who have withdrawn full consent (see Section 9.3). 
6. CONCOMITANT ME
DICATIONS/PROCEDURES   
6.1. Permitted Concomitant Medications 
Blood and platelet transfusions a nd supportive medications (such as for emesis, diarrhea, etc.) in 
accordance with standard practice are permitted.  
In Part 1, erythropoietic and he matopoietic growth factors (fil grastim and pegfilgrastim except 
for 
what is included in the EPOCH regimen)  should only be given during the DLT period 
(ie, Cycle Day 1 through Cycle 2 Day 1 pre-dose [22 days total]) for Grade 3 or greater events, 
or if the patient fits the criteria for a DLT. Du ring subsequent cycles in  Part 1 and in Part 2, 
erythropoietic growth factors (e g, erythropoietin) and hematopoietic  growth factors filgrastim 
and pegfilgrastim are allowed per institutional policy and in accordance with the ASCO guidelines ( Smith 2006 ).   
Short courses of corticosteroids (< 14 da ys) for non-cancer-rela ted medical reasons 
(eg, treatment for rash, arthritis, asthma) at  doses that do not exceed 100 mg per day of 
prednisone or equiva lent are permitted.

IND 102,688   30 September 2014 
Pharmacyclics, Inc. Proprietary and Confidential 66 6.1.1. Prophylaxis of Pneumocystis Jirovec ii (Previously Pneumocystis Cari nii) 
Adult subjects will receive prophylaxis for Pneu mocystis Jiroveci during EPOCH chemotherapy. 
Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole 1 DS PO QD on  Monday, Wednesday, Friday is the preferred 
schedule.  
Subjects allergic to either co mponent may receive inhaled pentamidine 300 mg once a month or 
other standard treatments. 
6.1.2. Prophylaxis for Tumor Lysis Syndrome (TLS) 
At the discretion of the principa l investigator, subjects with hi gh tumor 
burden may be treated 
with allopurinol 600 mg PO x 1 dose follo wing by 300 mg PO daily for up to 7 days. 
Hospitalization with aggressi ve IV hydration and urinary alkalization may be used. 
6.1.3. Recommended Bowel Regimen  
The goal is to have at least 1 soft bowel motion every 24 hours while receiving 
treatment.  
Adult Subjects: Sodium Docusate 100 mg capsule; take 1 to 2 capsules once a day on Day 1–7 of 
each cycle.  If needed can double the frequency to 2 capsules every 12 hours.  If needed add oral 
lactulose 15–30 mL prn / q 6-hourly. 6.2. Concomitant Medications to be Used with Caution 
For subjects taking digoxin, peri odic monitoring of digoxin plasma levels is recomm 
ended due to 
increased Cmax and AUC with concomitant lenalidomide therapy (please see prescribing 
information). 
Subjects taking concomitant therapies such as erythropoietin stimulati ng agents or estrogen 
containing therapies, may have an increased risk of venous thromboembolism (please see 
prescribing information and lenalidomide background section). 
6.2.1. Concomitant Use of CYP3A Inhibitors/Inducers 
6.2.1.1. Ibrutinib 
Ibrutinib is metabolized 
primarily by CYP3A.  Avoid co-administration with strong or moderate 
CYP3A inhibitors and consider alternativ e agents with less CYP3A inhibition.  
Co-administration of ketoconazole, a strong CYP3 A inhibitor, in 18 healthy subjects increased 
dose normalized exposure, C max and AUC 0-last, of ibrutinib by 29- and 24-fold, respectively.  
The maximal observed ibrutinib exposure (AUC) was ≤ 2-fold in 37 subjects treated with mild 
and/or moderate CYP3A inhibitors when compared with the ibrutinib exposure in 76 subjects not 
treated concomitantly with CYP3A inhibitors.  Clin ical safety data in 66 subjects treated with 
moderate (n=47) or strong CYP3A inhibitors (n =19) did not reveal meaningful increases in 
toxicities. Co-administration of strong CYP3A inhi bitors (eg, ketoconazole, indinavir, nelfinavir, 
Ibrutinib (PCI-32765)  Protocol PCYC-1124-CA - Amendment 1 
IND 102,688   30 September 2014 
Pharmacyclics, Inc. Proprietary and Confidential 67 ritonavir, saquinavir, clarith romycin, telithromycin, itraconazole, and nefazadone) should be 
avoided.  If a strong CYP3A inhi bitor must be used, consider reducing the ibrutinib dose to 
140 mg or withhold treatment tem porarily.  Subjects should be monitored for signs of ibrutinib 
toxicity.  
If the benefit outweighs the risk and a moderate CYP3A inhibitor must be used, monitor subject 
for toxicity and follow dose modi fication guidance as needed ( Section 5.6.3).  Subjects should 
avoid grapefruit and Seville or anges during ibrutinib treatment , as these contain moderate 
inhibitors of CYP3A. 
Co-administration of ibrutinib with strong CY P3A inducers, rifampin, 
in healthy subjects 
decrease ibrutinib plasma concentrations by a pproximately 10-fold.  Avoid concomitant use of 
strong CYP3A inducers (eg, carbamazepine, ri fampin, phenytoin, and St. John’s Wort).  
Consider alternative agents with less CYP3A induction.   A list of common CYP3A inhibitors  or inducers is provided in Appendix C ; a comprehensive list 
of inhibitors, inducers, and substrates may be found at 
http://medicine.iupui.edu/clinpharm/ddis/table.asp x.  This website is co ntinually revised and 
should be checked frequently for updates. 
6.2.1.2. Lenalidomide 
Results from hum
an in vitro studies show that lenalidomide is neither metabolized by nor 
inhibits or induces the cytochro me 
P450 pathway suggesting that lenalidomide is not likely to 
cause or be subject to P450-based metabolic  drug interactions (p lease see lenalidomide 
prescribing information). 6.2.2. QT Prolongation 
Any medications known to cause QT prolongation s hould be used with caution; periodic ECG 
and electrolyte monitoring should be considered. 
6.2.3. Antiplatelet Agents and Anticoagulants 
6.2.3.1. Ibrutinib 
Warfarin or vitami
n K antagonists should not be administered concomitantly with ibrutinib.  
Supplements such as fish oil and vitamin E prepar ations should be avoided.  Ibrutinib should be 
used with caution in subjects re quiring 
other anticoagulants or me dications that inhibit platelet 
function.  Subjects with congenital bleeding diat hesis have not been studied.  For guidance on 
ibrutinib and the use of anticoagulan ts during procedures/surgeries see Section 6.4.   
For subjects requiring the initiati on of therapeutic anticoagulation th erapy (eg, atrial fibrillation), 
consider the risks and benefits of  continuing ibrutinib treatment.  If 
therapeutic an ticoagulation is 
clinically indicated, treatment with ibrutinib should  be held and not be re started until the subject

Pharmacyclics, Inc. Proprietary and Confidential 68 is clinically stable and has no signs of bleedi ng.  Subjects should be obs erved closely for signs 
and symptoms of bleeding.  No dose reduction is required when ibru tinib is restarted. 
6.3. Prohibited Concomitant Therapy 
Chemotherapy, anticancer immunotherapy, corticoste
roids for cancer-relate d reasons (except for 
the corticosteroids included in the DA-EPO CH-R regimen), experimental therapy, or 
radiotherapy are prohibited while th e subject is recei ving ibrutinib.   
The Sponsor must be notified in advance (or as soon as possible thereafter) of any instances in 
which prohibited therapies are administered. 
6.4. Guidelines for Ibrutinib Management  with Surgeries or Procedures  
Ibrutinib may increase risk of bleeding with invasive procedures or surgery.  The following 
guidance should be applied to th e use of ibrutinib in the peri operative period for subjects who 
require surgical intervention or an invasive procedure wh ile receiving ibrutinib:   
• For any surgery or invasive procedure requiri ng sutures or staples for closure, ibrutinib 
should be held at least 7 days prior to the intervention and should be held at least 7 days 
after the procedure and restarted at  the discretion of the investigator when the surgical site is 
reasonably healed without serosanguinous draina ge or the need for drainage tubes.   
• For minor procedures (such as a central line placement, needle biopsy, thoracentesis, or 
paracentesis) ibrutinib should be held for at least 3 days prior to the procedure and should 
not be restarted for at least 3 days after the procedure.  For bone marrow biopsies that are 
performed while the subject is on ibrutinib, it is not necessary to hold ibrutinib for these 
procedures.   
• For emergency procedures, ibrutinib should be he ld after the procedure until the surg ical site 
is reasonably healed, for at least 7 days  after the urgent su rgical procedure. 
7. STUDY EVALUATIONS  
The Schedule of Assessments is provided in Appendix A .  Descriptions of the scheduled 
evaluations are outlined below. 
Before study entry, throughout the study, and at the follow-up evaluations, various clinical and 
diagnostic laboratory evaluations are outline d.  The purpose of obtaining these detailed 
measurem
ents is to ensure adequate safety and efficacy assessments.  Clinical evaluations and 
laboratory assessments may be repeated mo re frequently if clinically indicated.

Pharmacyclics, Inc. Proprietary and Confidential 69 7.1. Description of Procedures 
7.1.1. Assessments 
7.1.1.1. Informed Consent 
The subject must read, understand, and sign the Institutional 
Review Board/Research Ethics 
Board/Independent Ethi cs Committee (IRB/REB/IEC)-approved  informed consent form (ICF) 
confirming his or her willi ngness to participate in this study before any study-specific screening 
procedures are performed.  Subjects must also  grant permission to use protected health 
information per Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).  In addition, 
subjects must sign all approved ICF amendments per the site IRB/REC/IEC’s guidelines during 
the course of the study. 
7.1.1.2. Confirmation of Eligibility 
Perform all necessary procedur es and evaluations to document that the subject meets each 
eligibility criterion ( Section 4).  De-identified copies of the pathology report confirming 
diagnosis of DLBCL (tumor biops y and bone marrow biopsy), a list of prior anticancer therapies 
and 
best responses, and the radiol ogy report from screening CT s can (or MRI if indicated) and 
positron emission tomography (PET) will need to be submitted to the sponsor as part of the 
enrollment process.  In addition, DLBCL subtype shoul d be provided (IHC testing at local 
laboratory) at the time of eligibility verification.   
To be eligible, all subjects must also have ar chival tissue for central IHC and GEP.  Formulin-
fixed paraffin embedded tissue (FFPE), a minimum of 10 slides, however 15–30 slides or a paraffin block is preferred, must be provided for central confirmation of DLBCL subtype (results 
not required for enrollment).  Tumor samples can be archival tissue from original diagnosis or 
from relapsed or refractory disease, or a fresh (recent) biopsy.  Refer to  the laboratory manual for 
a more detailed description of the arch ival tissue prepara tion and handling.   
7.1.1.3. Medical History 
The subject’s complete history through review  of medical records and by interview will be 
collected 
and recorded.  Concurrent medical signs and symptoms must be documented to 
establish baseline severities.  A disease history, including the date of initial diagno sis and list of 
all prior anti-cancer treatments, dates administ ered, and responses and duration of response to 
these treatments, also will be recorded. 
7.1.1.4. Prior and Concomitant Medications 
All medications from 14 days before the start of study drug admi
nistration through 30 days after 
the last dose of study drug will be documented.

IND 102,688   30 September 2014 
Pharmacyclics, Inc. Proprietary and Confidential 70 7.1.1.5. Adverse Events 
All AEs whether serious or non-seriou
s, will be documented in the source documents from the 
time signed and dated ICF is obtained until 30 days following the last dose of study drug. 
Only SAEs will be reported to th e Sponsor prior to the first dose of study drug.  From the first 
dose of study drug, AEs/SAEs will be recorded in the eCRFs and will continue until 30 days 
after the last dose of study drug.  
Laboratory abnormalities which result in signs and symptoms, require intervention or follow-up 
and are considered clinically significant should be  recorded as AEs.  AEs will be recorded at 
each visit or as reported during the treatment period. 
7.1.1.6. Physical Examination, and Height  
The physical examination will include, at a minimum, the general appearance of the subject, 
examination of the skin, eyes, ears, nose, throat, lungs, heart, abdomen, extremities and lymphatic 
system.  The musculoskeletal system and nervous system may be included in the examination if 
clinically indicated.  A complete physical examination will be performed at Screening, Response 
Assessment Visits, Day 1 of each Cycle and at the Safety Follow-Up Visit.  Symptom-directed 
physical examinations may be performed at all other visits.  Only physicians, physician assistant, or 
oncology nurse practitioners should perform the lymphatic system examination.  As much as 
possible, the same person should perform all the lymphatic examinations for a given subject. 
Height will be collected at Screening only. 
7.1.1.7. Venous Thromboembolism Risk Assessment 
The subject’s risk for development of venous thromboembolism (VTE) will be assessed.  General 
risk factors for subjects with cancer include, but are not limited to:  underlying disease, family 
history, age, obesity, immobilization, hormonal therap y, central venous catheter, recent DVT, gender, 
renal dysfunction and certain chemotherapy based regimens.  It is not known whether prophylactic anticoagulation or anti-platelet therapy prescribed in conjunction with lenalidomide may lessen the 
potential for venous thromboembolism.  It is up to the discretion of the Investigator after consideration of the subject’s individual risk/ben efit profile whether to institute VTE prophylaxis 
using a permitted concomitant medication (see Section 6.2.3).  It is recommended that protocol 
appropriate VTE prophyl axis be used 
in subject’s considered at high-risk for thrombosis.  
This assessment must be performed at the Screening Visit and may be performed anytime thereafter as appropriate.  Refer to Table 8 for dose modification in the event a VTE occurs while on treatment. 
7.1.1.8. Vital Signs 
Vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, respirator y rate, and body temperat ure) will be assessed 
after the subject 
has rested in the sitti ng position for approximately 3 minutes.   
Weight will also be collected.

Pharmacyclics, Inc. Proprietary and Confidential 71 7.1.1.9. ECOG Performance Status 
The ECOG performance index is provided in Appendix B . 
7.1.1.10. Electrocardiogram (EC
G) 
Subjects should be in supine position and rest ing for at least 10 minut es before study-related 
ECGs.  During visits in which both ECGs a nd blood draws are performed, ECGs should be 
perform
ed first. 
12-lead ECGs will be done in triplicate ( ≥1 minute apart); the calculated QTc average of the 
3 ECGs must be <470 msec for eligibility.  
Abnormalities noted at Screening should be included in the medical history.  Unscheduled ECGs should be performed at the investigator’s discretion, part icularly in subjects 
with arrhythmic symptoms (eg, palpitations , lightheadedness) or  new onset dyspnea. 
7.1.1.11. Echocardiogram or MUGA 
An echocardiogram (ECHO) or MUGA will be perf ormed at 
 Screening on all subjects to assess 
cardiac function and measure ejection fraction.  Abnormalities noted at screening should be 
included in the medical hi story, as appropriate.   
Additional ECHO or MUGA examinations may be  performed at any time during the study, 
as determined by the investigator. 
7.1.1.12. Bone Marrow Aspirate and Biopsy 
For Eligibility 
A unilateral bone marrow aspirate and biopsy must 
be obtained at Screening or up to 28 days 
prior to the first administration of study drug.  Subjects who have a bone marrow aspirate and 
biopsy result since completion of their last therapy for DLBCL may use those bone marrow results, provided the biopsy/aspirate was done  <28 days prior to first dose of study drug. 
Testing will be performed at the st udy center’s local laborat ory or other clinical  laboratory listed 
on the investigator’s form FDA 1572.  De-identified copies of all bone marrow biopsy/aspirate results must be provided to the Sponsor. 
For Response Confirmation 
If the subject’s physical examination findi ngs, laboratory evaluati ons, and radiographic 
evaluations suggest that CR has been achieved in all response parameters, and the screening 
bone marrow evaluation was positive for lympho ma, a repeat bone marrow aspirate and biopsy 
must be obtained to confirm the CR and to evalua te minimal residual disease (MRD).  In cases

IND 102,688   30 September 2014 
Pharmacyclics, Inc. Proprietary and Confidential 72 where cytopenic progression is suspected, a bone marrow aspirate or biopsy should be performed 
to distinguish autoimmune and drug-related cytopenias. 
7.1.1.13. Optional Tumor Biopsy 
Patients 
with accessible tumor tissue who agree to have an optional biopsy performed will be 
biopsied prior to treatment.  Patients who have a partial or complete re sponse and later develop 
recurrent disease will be encouraged to have an  additional biopsy at the time of recurrence.  
Molecular characterization of this sample may identify altered signaling patterns or mutations 
that associate with response or re sistance to ibrutinib treatment.   
For a subject who consents to participate in th e optional tumor tissue sample assessment, fresh, 
frozen and/or formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue will be collected at least 3 days 
prior to the start of ibrutinib/l enalidomide for pre-treatment biops ies, and within 30 (±7) days 
after the last dose of ibrutinib or prior to the start of a new anti-can cer treatment for post 
treatment biopsies.  Please refer to the laboratory binder for additional instructions on collecting 
and processing this sample.

Pharmacyclics, Inc. Proprietary and Confidential 73 7.1.2.3. Hepatitis Serologies 
Hepatitis serologies include Hepatitis C an tibody, Hepatitis B surface antigen, Hepatitis B 
surface 
antibody, and Hepatitis B core antibody.  Vira l load by PCR must be confirmed negative 
in equivocal cases for subjects who are Hepatitis B core antib ody positive, Hepatitis B surface 
antigen positive, Hepatitis B surface antibody positive (unless immunized) or Hepatitis C 
antibody positive.   
7.1.2.4. Pregnancy Test 
A pregnancy test (urine or seru m) 
with a sensitivity of 25 mIU/ mL must be done in accordance 
with Celgene Revlimid REMS™ guidelines for females of childbearing potential (FCBP) only.  
If the pregnancy test is positive at Sc reening, the subject is not eligible.   
A FCBP is a sexually mature female who:  1)  has not undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral 
oophorectomy; or 2) has not been naturally postmenopausal (amenorrhea following cancer 
therapy does not rule out childbearing potential) for at least 24 consecutive months (ie, has had 
menses at any time in the preceding 24 consecutive months).   
Pregnancy tests must occur within 10–14 days and again within 24 hours prior to prescribing 
Cycle 1 of lenalidomide.  A FCBP  with regular or no menstruation must have a pregnancy test 
weekly for the first 28 days and then every 28 days while on lenalidomide therapy (including 
breaks in therapy); at discon tinuation of lenalidomide and at Day 28 post the last dose of 
lenalidomide.  A FCBP with irregular menstruati on must have a pregnancy test weekly for the 
first 28 days and then every 14 days while on lenalidomide therapy (including breaks in therapy), 
at discontinuation of lenalidomide and at Day 14 and Day 28 following lenalidomide discontinuation.  
In order to allow for drug delivery in the US , pregnancy testing can be performed on Days 15–21 
of each cycle.  A pregnancy test may be perfor med more frequently if required by local and 
national requirements. 
7.1.2.5. Coagulation Studies

On the day of the sampling visit, the subject will  not take lenalidomide or ibrutinib dose before 
arrival at the clinic.  Study drug intake will be observed by clinic staff.  The time of the PK 
sample and the time of the study drug dose will be recorded in the CRF. 
7.1.2.9. Urinalysis 
Urinalysis includes pH, ketones, specific gr avity, bilirubin, protein, blood, and glucose.  
Testing will be performed at the st udy center’s local laborat ory or other clinical  laboratory listed 
on the investigator’s form FDA 1572. 
7.1.3. Radiological Examinations 
Pretreatment 
tumor assessment 
will be performed within 21 days before the first dose of study 
drug.  Lesions that have been irradiated ca nnot be included in the tumor assessment unless 
unequivocal tumor progression has been documented in these lesions afte r radiation therapy.

IND 102,688   30 September 2014 
Pharmacyclics, Inc. Proprietary and Confidential 75 A CT scan (with contrast unless contraindicated) of the neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis and any 
other disease sites (eg, extremity) and a positr on emission tomography (PET) scan are required 
for the pretreatment tumor assessment.  Information on extranodal involvement (eg, gastric or 
ocular disease) will also  be obtained.  Lesions in  anatomical locations that are not well visualized 
by CT may be measured at base line by MRI instead and should c ontinue to be measured by MRI 
until disease progression.   
In the case where CT with contrast is contra indicated, an alternativ e would be MRI of the 
abdomen and pelvis and CT of the chest and neck  without contrast.  In this case, neck nodes 
cannot be used as target lesions. 
There must be radiographically measurable di sease at Screening (at least one lymph node 
≥ 1.5 cm in the longest diameter).  Up to 6 measurable lymph nodes (target lesions ≥1.5 cm in 
the longest diameter), clearly measurable in 2 perpendicular dimensions, will be followed as 
target lesions for each subject.  Measurable sites of disease should be chosen such that they are 
representative of the subject’s di sease.  In addition, selection of target lesions should be from as 
disparate regions of the body as possible when  these areas are significantly involved.  
If additional lesions are present but are not includ ed in the target lesion assessment, they can be 
added as non-target lesions a nd followed throughout the study. 
NOTE:  PET/CT hybrid scanners may be used to ac quire the required CT images only if the CT 
produced by the scanner is of diagnostic quality, adheres to the specified slice thickness/scan 
parameters, and includes the use of  intravenous (IV)  contrast.    
If using a hybrid machine to acquire both PET a nd CT, the PET must be performed prior to the 
CT with IV contrast as to not compromise PET results.  
If independent CT and PET scanners are used, and the subject is rece iving both scans on the 
same day, the PET must be performed prior to the CT with IV contrast. 
7.1.4. Overall Response Assessments 
Overall response assessments will include evaluation 
of physical examinations, recording of 
symptoms, hematological evaluations, and radi ographic evaluations as  per the schedule of 
assessments (see Appendix A ).  Subjects will be restaged af ter Cycle 3 (Cycle 4 Day 1, -4 days 
[Cycle 3 Day 19 to Cycle 4 Day 1]) and after Cy cle 6 (Cycle 6 Day 21 ± 4 days) of treatment, 
then every 3, 4, and 6 months during post-trea tment years 1, 2 and 3 respectively.  Response 
assessments will be performed according to the revised International 
Working Group Response 
Criteria for NHL ( Cheson 2007 ), as assessed by investigators (see Appendix D ).   
7.1.5. Survival 
After progression, survival  status will be assessed approxi mately every 12 weeks until death, 
withdrawal by subject, lost to follow-up, or study  terminated by Sponsor, whichever comes 
first.

Following completion of the Screening Visit and once eligibility h
as been confirmed by PCYC, 
subjects must begin the Treatment Phase of the st udy within 7 days of enrollment.  If laboratory 
tests are required to be collected pre-dose of Day 1 of Cycle 1, subj ect must continue to meet all 
eligibility criteria to begin treatment.  After Cycle 1, pre-dose assessments may be performed up 
to 2 days prior to Day 1 of a cy cle expect where otherwise noted. 
In the Treatment Phase, subjects will receive th erapy until disease progre ssion or a maximum of 
six cycles of 21 days each whichever occurs first.    
Study drug treatment should be continued until disease progression, unacceptable 
treatment-related toxicity, or other reasons outlined in Section 9.2 .  Local laboratory results will 
be used to guide all dosing-related decisions.  He matology results during th e first cycle to assess

9. SUBJECT COMPLETION AND WITHDRAWAL  
9.1. Completion 
A subject will be considered to have completed th e study if he or she has died before the end of 
the study, has not been lost to follow up, or has not withdrawn consent be fore the end of study.  
9.2. Treatment 
Discontinuation 
Study treatment will be discontinued in the event of any of the followin
g events: 
• Subject has confirmed progressive disease. 
• Subject has an intercur rent illness or AE that preven ts further study drug administration. 
• Subject decides to withdraw from study.  
• Subject requires a prohibite d concomitant medication. 
• Investigator decision (such as chronic noncomplia nce, significant protoc ol deviation, or best 
interest of the subject) 
• Study termination by Sponsor 
• Subject becomes pregnant. 
All subjects, regardless of reason for discontinuation of study treatment (with the exception of 
withdrawal of consent) will unde rgo a Safety Follow-Up visit and be followed for progression 
and survival.  
The Investigator should notif y the Sponsor within 24 hours if a subject discontinues study 
treatment due to disease progression and shoul d provide documentation of disease progression 
for review by the Sponsor’s Medical Monitor.  If a subject shows signs of disease progression on 
physical examination or laboratory assessment, the subject may continue study treatment until disease progression is confirmed.  These subjects  should stay in the study to be followed for 
survival.

Exit from study (including all follow-up) wi ll occur under the following circumstances: 
• W
ithdrawal of consent for follow-up observation by the subject 
• Lost to follow-up 
• Study termination by Sponsor 
• Death 
If a subject is lost to foll ow-up, every reasonable effort should be made by the study site 
personnel to contact the subjec t.  The measures taken to follow up should be documented. 
When a subject withdraws before completing the study, the following information should be 
documented in the source documents: 
• Reason for withdrawal; 
• Whether the subject withdraws full consent (i e, withdraws consent to treatment and all 
further contact) or partial c onsent (ie, withdraws consent to treatment but agrees to 
participate in follow-up visits) 
10. STATISTICAL METHODS AND ANALYSIS  
Statistical analysis will be pe rformed by the sponsor or under the authority of the sponsor.  
A general description of the statis tical methods for the analysis of the efficacy and safety data is 
outlined below.  Specific details will be provided in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP). 
10.1. General Considerations 
Part 1 of this study is a dose- escalation study.  All safety and efficacy assessments will be 
summarized by dose group. 
Part 2 of this single-arm
 study is designed to as sess the efficacy and safety of ibrutinib in 
combination with multiple anti-tumor agents (defined in Section 5) in subjects with relapsed or 
refractory de novo non-GCB DLBCL.  Non-GCB subt ype subjects 
will be enrolled by IHC but 
the primary analysis will be in ABC subjects only as classified by GEP. 
10.1.1. Response Assessment 
Response assessments will be ma
de by investigat ors.  Tumor response will be assessed by the 
investigator using the revi sed International Working Group Response Criteria for NHL 
(Cheson 2007). 
Ibrutinib (PCI-32765)  Protocol PCYC-1124-CA - Amendment 1 
IND 102,688   30 September 2014 
Pharmacyclics, Inc. Proprietary and Confidential 84 Confirmation of investigator-assessed responses by an independent review facility (IRF) may be 
done as a supportive assessment.  The method of i ndependent review will be governed by an IRF 
charter. 
10.1.2. Safety Monitoring 
This study will be monitored in accordance w ith the Sponsor’s 
Pharmacovigilance Committee 
procedures.  AEs and serious adverse events (S AEs) will be reviewed internally on an ongoing 
basis to identify safety concerns.  A Dose Le vel Review Committee will evaluate safety data 
from the dose escalation portion of Part 1.  Memb ers of this committee will include the Sponsor 
(at a minimum: the Medical Monitor or designee, a Drug Safety representative and a 
Biostatistician) as well as participat ing Investigators and Sub-Investigators. 
10.2. Definition of Analysis Populations 
The following definitions will be used for the efficacy and s
afety analysis sets.  Analyses in 
Part 1 will be performed across subtypes of DLBCL (eg, GCB, non-GCB, PMBL, ABC).  Part 2 analyses will be performed on the ABC s ubtype of DLBCL, with sensitivity analyses for 
the efficacy endpoints performed using the non-G CB subtype of DLBCL as determined by IHC. 
• All-treated analysis population:   All-treated analysis popula tion will include subjects who 
have enrolled in the study and r eceived at least 1 dose of any of  the study treatments.  This is 
the primary analysis population for efficacy endpoints for Part 1. 
• Safety analysis population:   All enrolled subjects who have  received at least 1 dose of any 
of the study treatments.  Safety analysis wi ll be performed using the safety population.  
• Response evaluable population:   All enrolled subjects who have  received at least 1 dose of 
any of the study treatments and have measurable disease at ba seline and have at least one 
adequate post treatment disease assessment by i nvestigator before the start of subsequent 
anti-cancer therapy.  This is the analysis populat ion for sensitivity analyses for the efficacy 
endpoints. 
• Combined efficacy population:  All enrolled analysis popula tion includes subjects who 
have received at least 1 dose of any of the study treatments and were enrolled in the 
MTD/MAD Part 1 or Part 2.  This population is the subset of the all treated analysis 
population that will be used to analyze all efficacy endpoi nts for Part 2. 
10.3. Endpoint Data Analysis 
10.3.1. Demographic/Baseline Characteristics and Study Conduct 
Subject demographics 
(including age, sex, and r ace/ethnicity) and other baseline characteristics 
(including ECOG performance status, disease burden, and number of prior therapies) will be 
summarized.  Summary statistics will include means, standard deviations, and medians for continuous variables and proportion s for categorical variables.

IND 102,688   30 September 2014 
Pharmacyclics, Inc. Proprietary and Confidential 85 Further, compliance parameters (including numbe r of doses taken compared with number of 
doses that should have been taken), the reas on for discontinuation, and concurrent treatments 
will also be similarly summarized. 
10.3.2. Efficacy Endpoints for Part 1 
The efficacy endpoints for Part 1 of this tria l are overall response (ORR) defined as the 
proportion 
of subjects who achieve either a CR or  a PR according to the International Working 
Group Response Criteria for NHL as assessed by the investigators (Cheson 2007).  The ORR of 
Part 1 and its 95% 2-sided exact confidence interval (CI) will be calculated for the All Treated 
Population of Part 1b.  10.3.3. Primary Efficacy Endpoint for Part 2 
The primary efficacy endpoint for Part 2 is th e ORR (CR+PR) as assessed by investigators. 
The ORR will be calculated for the co
mbined efficacy population of Part 2 for each subtype of 
DLBCL as determined by GEP.  The corresponding 95% 1-sided exact CI will be derived for 
each subtype.  If the lower bound of the CI around the ORR is greater than or equal to 60% for 
the ABC subtype of DLBCL, then the hypothesis that the ORR of ibrutinib combination treatment in the ABC subtype of DLBCL is equal to or lower than 60% will be rejected at the 
α = 5% level. 
10.3.4. Secondary Efficacy Endpoints for Part 2 
The secondary efficacy endpoints of Part 2 of this trial are DOR, PFS and OS. 
10.3.4.1. Duration of Response 
For 
subjects achieving ob
jective response as asse ssed by investigators, their DOR as assessed by 
investigators will be calculated to determine dur ability.  Duration of response will be measured 
from the time by which the measurement criteria are met for CR or PR, whichever is recorded 
first, until the first date by which recurrent or  progressive disease is objectively documented 
(taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the 
treatment started).   
The distribution (median, its 95% CI and Kaplan-Meier curves) of DOR will be provided using 
Kaplan-Meier estimates for responders in the combined efficacy population. 
10.3.4.2. Progression-free Survival 
Progression-free survival 
will be measured as  time from first study drug administration to 
disease progression or death from any cause.  Da ta for subjects without disease progression or 
death will be censored at the date of the last tumor assessment and before the initiation of 
alternative anti cancer therapy.

IND 102,688   30 September 2014 
Pharmacyclics, Inc. Proprietary and Confidential 86 Progression-free survival will be calculated usi ng assessments by investigators.  Kaplan-Meier 
methodology will be used to estimate even t-free curves and corresponding quartiles 
(including the median) using th e combined efficacy population. 
10.3.4.3. Overall Survival 
The duration of overall survival (OS) will be
 measured from the time of first study drug 
administration until the date of death.  Kaplan -Meier methodology will be used to estimate 
overall survival curves and corresponding quartiles  (including the median).  Data for subjects 
who have not died will be censored at the date of the last known to be alive.  
The distribution (median, its 95% CI and Kaplan-Meier curves) of OS will be provided using 
Kaplan-Meier estimates using the combined efficacy population. 
10.3.5. Exploratory/Sensitivity Analysis 
Exploratory subgroup analyses and sensitivity analyses using the non-GCB subtype of DLBCL 
as determined by IHC from
 the combined efficacy population will be conducted focusing on key 
efficacy parameters such as ORR, DOR, PFS and OS. 
10.3.6. Safety Endpoint 
Safety 
summaries will include tabulations in the form of tables and listings.  The frequency 
(number and percentage) of treatment-emergent AEs will be reported by MedDRA® System 
Organ Class and Preferred Term.  Additional AE summaries will include AE frequency by AE 
severity and by relationship to  study drug (ibrutinib, lena lidomide, and DA-EPOCH-R). 
AEs requiring discontinuation of study drug will be summarized  separately, both overall and by 
AE severity and by relationship to study drug. 
Clinically significant abnormal laboratory values will be summarized.  Laboratory shift tables 
containing counts and percentages will be prepar ed by laboratory paramete r and time.  Summary 
tables will be prepared for each laboratory parameter.  Figures of changes in laboratory 
parameters over time will be generated. 
Safety: Missing or partial start and end date s for AEs and concomitant medications will be 
imputed according to pre-specified, conservative imputation rules.  No other imputation of 
values for missing data will be performed. 
10.3.7. Pharmacokinetics 
Plasma concentrations of 
ibrutinib and a majo r metabolite (PCI-45227) w ill be determined using 
a validated analytical method.  Other potential  metabolites of ibrutinib may be explored. 
Ibrutinib (PCI-32765)  Protocol PCYC-1124-CA - Amendment 1 
IND 102,688   30 September 2014 
Pharmacyclics, Inc. Proprietary and Confidential 87 Bioanalytical data from this study will be used in noncompartmental PK analysis.  Ibrutinib and 
PCI-45227 data will be listed for al l subjects with available plasma  concentrations.  Subjects will 
be excluded from the PK analysis if their data  do not allow for accurate  assessment of the PK 
(eg, incomplete administration of the study agen t; concentration data not sufficient for PK 
parameter calculation due to missing PK draws at  multiple visits; or early discontinuation from 
the study). 
Derived PK parameters may be subjected to  further explore PK/pharmacodynamic correlation 
between exposure and relevant c linical or biomarker information. 
Bioanalytical data from this study may also be co mbined with data from other studies performed 
with ibrutinib in subjects with  hematologic malignancies as pa rt of a population PK analysis 
using nonlinear mixed effects models using NON MEM.  Available subject characteristics 
(demographics, laboratory variables, genotypes, etc) will be test ed as potential covariates 
affecting PK parameters.  The results of the population PK analyses (if performed) will be 
presented in a separate report. 
10.3.8. Biomarkers 
• Identification of signaling pathways or biomarkers that predict sensitivity or resi
stance to 
ibrutinib.  
• Frequency of tumor mutations (or other molecu lar markers) between pre- and post-treatment 
tissue that predict acquired resistance. 
Additional analysis details will be provided in the SAP.  10.4. Handling of Missing Data 
General Considerations: Subjects lost to follow-up (or who dr opped out) will be includ 
ed in 
statistical analyses up to the point of their last evaluation. 10.5. Determination of Sample Size  
The planned sample size 
for Part 2 is approximate ly 26 subjects.  The main analysis will be the 
comparison of the response rate within the ABC subtype of DLBCL to the ORR of a historical 
control of 60%.  In subjects with relapsed a nd refractory DLBCL, EPOCH was observed to have 
a response rate of between 68–75% ( Gutierrez 2000 , Jermann 2004 ), and since the response rate 
is expected to be lower in the more aggressive  ABC subtype, an ORR of 60% has been selected 
for the historic control value.  A Part 2 sample  size of 26 subjects will have 81% power to test 
the null hypothesis that ORR will be ≤60% versus the alternative hypothesis that ORR will be 
≥85% at the 1-sided significance level α =5% when the exact test method is used.

IND 102,688   30 September 2014 
Pharmacyclics, Inc. Proprietary and Confidential 88 10.6. Safety Analysis 
Analysis of safety data will be conducted on the safety population, which includes enrolled 
subjects who receive at least 1 dos e of any of the study treatments.  
The baseline value for safety 
assessments will be defined as the last value on or before the day of the first dose of study drugs  
if not specified.  Further details for selecting the baseline value of safety parameters will be 
described in the SAP.  The safety analyses wi ll be based on the monitoring of adverse events, 
survival status, ECOG performance status, vita l sign measurements, and clinical laboratory 
results. 
The safety variables to be analyzed include AEs,  clinical laboratory te st results (hematology and 
chemistry), physical examination findings, and v ital sign measurements.  Exposure to ibrutinib 
and other study drugs and reasons for discontinua tion from study treatment will be tabulated.  
In general, continuous variables will be summ arized using descriptiv e statistics (n, mean, 
median, standard deviation, standa rd error and range).  Categorica l variables will be summarized 
using frequencies and percentages.  No formal statistical testing is planned.  
10.6.1. Adverse Events 
AE parameters 
to be evaluated ar e the type, incidence, and intens ity of AEs; the relationship of 
AEs to ibrutinib; and the action taken with respect to ibrutinib treatment due to AEs. 
The verbatim terms used in the eCRF by Invest igators to identify non-hematological adverse 
events will be coded using the Medical Dict ionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). 
Treatment-emergent AEs are those AEs occurring af ter the first dose of study drugs and within 
30 days following the last dose of study drug; any AE that is consid ered study drug-related 
regardless of the start date of the event; or any AE that is present at baseline but worsens after 
the first administration of study drug in severity or is subsequently considered drug-related by 
the Investigator.  All treatment-emergent AEs w ill be included in the analysis.  For each AE, 
the percentage of subjects who experience at least 1 occurrence  of the given event will be 
summarized.  The number and percent of subjects with treatment-emergen t adverse events will 
be summarized according to intensity (NCI CTCA E, Version 4.03) and drug relationship as well 
as categorized by system organ class and pr eferred term.  Summaries, listings, datasets, 
or subject narratives may be provided, as appropriate, for those subjects who die, 
who discontinue treatment due to an AE, or  who experience a severe or a serious AE. 
10.6.2. Clinical Laboratory Tests 
Laboratory tests will be summarized separately for hematology and serum chem
istry.  
Local laboratory results will be converted based on the normal ranges and standardized using the SI unit.  Selected hematologic and chemistry laboratory parameters are detailed in Section 7.1.2. 
Descriptive statistics will be prov ided for the values of selected clinical laborator 
y tests at each 
scheduled on-treatment evaluati on including the final value.  Pe rcent change from baseline to 
each scheduled on-treatment evaluation and to the final value will also be summarized.

IND 102,688   30 September 2014 
Pharmacyclics, Inc. Proprietary and Confidential 89 For selected variables, the mean value and m ean percent change over time will be presented 
graphically. 
A summary of the shifts in sel ected laboratory hematology and serum chemistry parameters from 
baseline to the worst toxicity grade during the study will be provided.  The worst toxicity grade 
during the study will be tabulated. All laboratory values will be converted to standa rd international units and will be graded using 
the NCI CTCAE Version 4.03.  Standard methods for summarizing laboratory variables will be 
used, including the use of summar y statistics and shift tables. 
11. ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING
 
Timely, accurate, and complete reporting and analysis of safety in formation from clinical studies 
are crucial for the protection of subjects, inve stigators, and the spons or, and are mandated by 
regulatory agencies worldwide.  The sponsor has established Standard Op erating Procedures in 
conformity with regulatory requi rements worldwide to ensure appropriate reporting of safety 
information; all clinical studies conducted by th e sponsor or its affiliates will be conducted in 
accordance with those procedures. 
11.1. Adverse Event Definitions and Classifications 
11.1.1. Adverse Events 
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject admi
nistered a pharmaceutical product 
and which does not necessarily have a causal rela tionship with this treatment.  An AE can 
therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an a bnormal laboratory finding, 
for example), symptom, or disease temporally asso ciated with the use of an investigational study 
drug, whether or not considered  related to the study drug ( ICH-E2A 1995 ).  
For the purposes of this clinical study, AEs incl ude events which are either new or represent 
detectable exacerbations of pre-existing conditions.  
Disease progression is not an AE; rather it ma y be the cause of an AE.  AEs that occur 
due to disease progression must be reporte d as all other treatme nt-emergent AEs.  
“Disease progression” should never be an AE term. 
AEs may include, but are not limited to: 
• Subjective or objective symptoms  spontaneously offered by th e subject and/or observed by 
the investigator or study sta ff including laboratory abnormalitie s of clinical significance. 
• Any AEs experienced by the subject after th e ICF is signed and for 30 days following the 
last dose of study drug. 
Ibrutinib (PCI-32765)  Protocol PCYC-1124-CA - Amendment 1 
IND 102,688   30 September 2014 
Pharmacyclics, Inc. Proprietary and Confidential 90 • AEs not previously observed in the subject that emerge duri ng the protocol-specified AE 
reporting period, including signs or symptoms associated with DLBCL that were not present 
before the AE reporting period. 
• Complications that occur as a result of pr otocol-mandated interventions (eg, invasive 
procedures such as biopsies). 
The following are NOT considered an AE: 
• Pre-existing condition:   A pre-existing condition (doc umented on the medical history 
eCRF) is not considered an AE unless the seve rity, frequency, or character of the event 
worsens during the study period. 
• Preplanned or elective hospitalization:  A hospitalization planned before signing the ICF 
is not considered an SAE, but rather a ther apeutic intervention.  However, if during the 
pre-planned hospitalization an event occurs, which prolongs the hospitalization or meets any 
other SAE criteria, the event will be considered  an SAE.  Surgeries or interventions that 
were under consideration, but not performed be fore enrollment in the study will not be 
considered serious if they are performed afte r enrollment in the study for a condition that has 
not changed from its baseline level.  Elective hospitalizations for social reasons, solely for 
the administration of chemotherapy, or due to long travel distances are also not SAEs. 
• Diagnostic testing and procedures:   Testing and procedures should not to be reported as 
AEs or SAEs, but rather the cause for the test or procedure should be reported. 
• Asymptomatic treatment related lymphocytosis:  This event should also not be 
considered an AE.  Subjects with treatment -related lymphocytosis should remain on study 
treatment and continue with all study-related procedures. 
• DA-EPOCH induced neutropenia or thrombocytopenia:  The dose-adjustment paradigm 
was designed to produce a period of shallow neutropenia resulting in ANC nadirs of 
between 0.499 and 0.1 × 109/L in 34% of cycles, with more severe neutropenia (ANC 
< 0.1 × 109/L) in 15% of cycles (Wilson, 2002).  Ther efore, EPOCH-induced neutropenia or 
thrombocytopenia should not be recorded as an AE, unless neutropenia is accompanied by fever (febrile neutropenia) or infection, or  if thrombocytopenia is accompanied by bleeding, 
or the event meets criteria for serious.   
11.1.2. Serious Adverse Event 
An SAE based on ICH and EU Guidelines on Ph arm
acovigilance for Medicinal Products for 
Human Use is any untoward medical  occurrence that at any dose: 
• results in death (ie, the AE actually causes or leads to death) 
• is life-threatening. “life-threateni ng” is defined as an AE in wh ich the subject was at risk of 
death at the time of the event.  It does not re fer to an event that hypothetically might have 
caused death if it were more severe.  If either th e investigator or the Sponsor believes that an 
AE meets the definition of lif e-threatening, it will be c onsidered life-threatening. 
• requires inpatient hospitalization >24 hours or prolongation of ex isting hospitalization 
Ibrutinib (PCI-32765)  Protocol PCYC-1124-CA - Amendment 1 
IND 102,688   30 September 2014 
Pharmacyclics, Inc. Proprietary and Confidential 91 • results in persistent or significant disability/i ncapacity (ie, the AE results in substantial 
disruption of the subject’s abilit y to conduct normal life functions) 
• is a congenital anomaly/birth defect 
• is an important medical event that may not resu lt in death, be immediat ely life-threatening or 
require hospitalization, but may be consid ered an SAE when, based upon appropriate 
medical judgment, the event may jeopardize the subject, or subject ma y require intervention 
to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in th is definition.  Examples of such events are 
intensive treatment in an emergency department or at home for allergic bronchospasm, 
blood dyscrasias, or convulsion that does not re sult in hospitalization; or development of 
drug dependency or drug abuse. 
Given that the investigator’s pe rspective may be informed by having actually observed the event, 
and the Sponsor is likely to have broader knowle dge of the drug and its effects to inform its 
evaluation of the significance of the event, if eith er the Sponsor or the investigator believes that 
the event is serious, the event will be considered serious. 
11.1.3. Unexpected Adverse Events 
An “unexpected” AE is an AE that is not listed in the Investigator 's 
Brochure/package insert or is 
not listed at the specificity or severity that ha s been observed.  For example, hepatic necrosis 
would be “unexpected” (by virtue of greater seve rity) if the Investigator 's Brochure referred only 
to elevated hepatic enzymes or hepatitis.  Similarly, cerebral thromboembolism and cerebral 
vasculitis would be “unexpected” (by virtue of greater specific ity) if the Investigator's 
Brochure/package insert listed only cerebral vascular accidents.  "Unexpected" also refers to AEs 
that are mentioned in the Investigator's Brochur e as occurring with a class of drugs or as 
anticipated from the pharmacological properties of  the drug, but are not specifically mentioned 
as occurring with the study drug under investigation. 
11.1.4. Severity Criteria (Grade 1–5) 
Definitions found in the CTCAE (version 4.03) will be used 
for grading the severity (intensity) 
of AEs.  The CTCAE v4.03 displays Grades 1 th rough 5 with unique clinical descriptions of 
severity for each referenced AE.  Should a subj ect experience any AE not listed in the CTCAE 
v4.03, the following grading system should be used to assess severity: 
• Grade 1 (Mild AE) – experiences that are usua lly transient, requiri ng no special treatment, 
and do not interfere with the subject’s daily activities. 
• Grade 2 (Moderate AE) – experiences that introd uce some level of inconvenience or concern 
to the subject, and that may interfere with daily activities, but are usually ameliorated by 
simple therapeutic measures. 
• Grade 3 (Severe AE) – experiences that are unacceptable or intolerable, significantly 
interrupt the subject’s usual daily activity, and require sy stemic drug therapy or other 
treatment. 
Ibrutinib (PCI-32765)  Protocol PCYC-1124-CA - Amendment 1 
IND 102,688   30 September 2014 
Pharmacyclics, Inc. Proprietary and Confidential 92 • Grade 4 (Life-threatening or di sabling AE) – experien ces that cause the subject to be in 
imminent danger of death. 
• Grade 5 (Death related to AE) – experi ences that result in subject death. 
11.1.5. Causality (Attribution) 
The investigator is to assess the causal 
relation (ie, whether there is a reasonable possibility that 
the study drug caused the event) using the following definitions: 
Not Related: Another cause of the AE is more plau sible; a temporal sequence cannot be 
established with the onset of the AE and administration of the 
investigational product; or, a causal relationship is considered biologically 
implausible. 
Unlikely: The current knowledge or informati on about the AE indicates that a 
relationship to the investigational product is unlikely. 
Possibly Related: There is a clinically plausible time sequence between onset of the AE and 
administration of the investigational product, but the AE could also be 
attributed to concurrent or underlying disease, or the use of other drugs or 
procedures.  Possibly related should be used when the investigational 
product is one of several biol ogically plausible AE causes. 
Related: The AE is clearly related to us e of the investigational product. 
11.2. Documenting and Reporting of Adverse Events  
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that all AEs and SAEs  that are observed or reported 
during the study, as outlined in the prior sections, are recorded on the eCRF.  All SAEs also must 
be reported on an SAE Worksheet 
and submitted to the Sponsor (see Section 11.2.2.1)  
11.2.1. Special Reporting Situations 
Safety events of interest on a sponsor study dr ug that may require expedited reporting and/or 
safety evaluation 
include, but are not limited to: 
• Overdose of a study drug 
• Suspected abuse/misuse of a study drug 
• Inadvertent or accidenta l exposure to a study drug 
• Medication error involving a produc t (with or without subject/pa tient exposure to the study 
drug, eg, name confusion) 
Special reporting situatio ns should be recorded in the eCRF.  Any special reporti ng situation that 
meets the criteria of a serious AE should be recorded on the serious AE page of the eCRF. 
Ibrutinib (PCI-32765)  Protocol PCYC-1124-CA - Amendment 1 
IND 102,688   30 September 2014 
Pharmacyclics, Inc. Proprietary and Confidential 93 11.2.2. All Adverse Events 
All subjects who receive at le ast 1 dose of study drug(s) will be
 considered evaluable for 
toxicity.  All AEs (with the exception of dis ease progression) and speci al reporting situations, 
whether serious or non-serious, will be recorded in the source documents from the time a signed 
and dated ICF is obtained until 30 days following th e last dose of study drug.  Starting from the 
time of first dose of study drug, all AEs and SAEs will be entered in the eCRF until 30 days after 
the date of last dose of study drug.  Serious Adverse Events that occur during study conduct 
including the screening period must  be reported to the Sponsor Se rious adverse events occurring 
more than 30 days following the last dose of st udy drug should also be reported if considered 
related to any of the study drugs.  Resolution information after 30 days should be provided.  
All Grade 3 or Grade 4 adverse events consider ed related to study drug must be followed until 
recovery to baseline or Grade ≤1.  The unresolved aforementioned events will be followed for a 
maximum of 6 months.   
Progressive disease should NOT be reported as an AE, but inst ead symptoms/clinical signs of 
disease progression may be reported.  Otherwise, all events that meet the definition of a SAE will 
be reported as SAEs, regardless of whethe r they are protocol-specific assessments. 
All AEs, regardless of seriousness, severity, or presumed relationship to study drug, must be 
recorded using medical terminology in the source document.  All records w ill need to capture the 
details of the duration and the se verity of each episode, the action taken with respect to the study 
drug, investigator’s evaluation of  its relationship to the study drug, and the event outcome.  
Whenever possible, diagnoses should be given when signs and symptoms are due to a common 
etiology (e.g., cough, runny nose, sneezing, sore th roat, and head congestion should be reported 
as "upper respiratory infection").  Investigators must record in th e eCRF their opinion concerning 
the relationship of the AE to st udy therapy.  All measures required for AE management must be 
recorded in the source document and reported according to sponsor instructions. 
The sponsor assumes responsibility for appropriate reporting of AEs to th e regulatory authorities 
and governing bodies according to the local regulations. 
11.2.2.1. Expedited Reporting Criteria for Serious Adverse Events 
All SAEs occurring during the study  must 
be reported to the Sponsor contact person within 
24 hours of their knowledge of the event. Information regarding SAEs will be transmitted to the Sponsor using the SAE Form/MedWatch 
or Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences (CIOMS), which must be 
completed by a physician from the study site, and submitted to the Sponsor within 24 hours of 
when the investigator becomes aware of the event.  
Ibrutinib (PCI-32765)  Protocol PCYC-1124-CA - Amendment 1 
IND 102,688   30 September 2014 
Pharmacyclics, Inc. Proprietary and Confidential 94 All SAEs that have not resolved by the end of the study, or that have not resolved upon 
discontinuation of the subject's participation in the study, must be followed until any of the 
following occurs: 
• The event resolves 
• The event stabilizes 
• The event returns to baseline, if a baseline value/status is available 
• The event can be attributed to agents other than the study drug  or to factors unrelated to 
study conduct 
• It becomes unlikely that any additional inform ation can be obtained (subject or health care 
practitioner refusal to provide additional information, lost to  follow up after demonstration 
of due diligence with follow-up efforts) 
11.2.3. Events of Special Interest 
Specific AEs, or groups of AEs, will be followed as  part of standard safe ty monitoring activities 
by the Sponsor.  These events will be reported to the sponsor within 24 hours of awareness 
irrespective of seriousness (ie, serious and nonserious AEs) fo llowing the procedure described 
above for SAEs and will require 
enhanced data collection.   
11.2.3.1. Major Hemorrhage 
Major hemorrhage is defined as any hemorrhagic 
event that is Grade 3 or gr eater in severity or 
that results in one of the following: intraocu lar bleeding causing loss of  vision, any hemorrhagic 
event which results in the need for a transfusion of  2 or more units of red cells or an equivalent 
amount of whole blood, hosp italization, or prolongati on of hospitalization.  
Events meeting the definition of major hemorrhage will be captured as an event of special 
interest according to Section 11.2.3 above. 
11.2.3.2. Intracranial Hemorrhage 
Any intracranial hemorrhage AE, including subdural hematoma/hemorrhage, epidur
al 
hematoma/hemorrhage and intracerebral hemorrhage, of any grade severity, will be captured as 
an AESI according to Section 11.2.3 above. 
11.2.4. Other Malignancies 
All new malignant tumors 
including solid tumors, skin malignancies and hematologic 
malignancies will be reported for the dur ation of study treatment and during any 
protocol-specified follow-up pe riods including post-progressi on follow-up for overall survival.

IND 102,688   30 September 2014 
Pharmacyclics, Inc. Proprietary and Confidential 95 11.2.5. Pregnancy 
All initial reports of pregnancy must be reported to the sponsor by the study-site personnel 
within 24 hours of their knowledge  of the event using the appr opriate pregnancy notification 
form
.  Abnormal pregnancy outcomes (eg, spon taneous abortion, stillb irth, and congenital 
anomaly) are considered SAEs and must be re ported in a timely fashion.  Any subject who 
becomes pregnant during the study must discontinue  further study treatment.  Because the effect 
of the study drug on sperm is unknown, pregnancies in partners of male subjects included in the 
study will be reported by the study-site personnel within 24 h ours of their knowledge of the 
event using the appropriate pregnancy notifica tion form.  Follow-up information regarding the 
outcome of the pregnancy and any postnatal sequelae in the infant will be required. 
11.3. Safety Cohort Review Committee 
A Safety Cohort Review Committee 
(SCRC) will review safety data in Part 1 after at least 
3 subjects are enrolled and complete one cycl e of therapy.  Members of this committee will 
include the Sponsor (at a minimum: the Me dical Monitor or designee, a Drug Safety 
representative and a Biostatistician) as well as participating Inve stigators and Sub -Investigators. 
All investigators w ho enrolled subjects in the safety c ohort must agree on the course of action 
based on the safety findings.  At least 2/3 of these investigators who enrolled subjects in the trial 
must attend the committee meeting, the rest can provide their vote by e-mail or other 
correspondence.  Based on the safety findings and recommendations of the SCRC, enrollment 
may continue at the current dose level, commence with the next dosing level of lenalidomide, be halted, or undergo modifications in  dose until the MTD is established.  
12. STUDY ADMINISTRATION AND INVESTIGATOR OBLIGATIONS
 
12.1. Regulatory and Ethical Compliance

before or during the study, such as SAE expedited reports or study progress reports. 
The IRB/REB/IEC must comply with current Un ited States (US) regulations (§21 CFR 56) 
as well as country-specific nationa l regulations and/ or local laws. 
The following documents must be provided to the S ponsor or its authorized representative before 
entering subjects in this study: (1) a copy of the IRB/REB/IEC lette r that grants formal approval; 
and (2) a copy of the IRB/REB/IEC-approved ICF. 
12.3. Informed Consent 
The ICF and process must comply with the US re gulations (§ 21 CFR Part 50) as well as country 
specific national regulations 
and/or local la ws.  The ICF will document the study-specific 
information the Investigator or his/her desi gnee provides to the subj ect and the subject’s 
agreement to participate.   
The Investigator or designee (designee must be listed on the Delegation of  Authority log), must 
explain in terms understandable to the subjec t the purpose and nature of the study, study 
procedures, anticipated benefits, potential risks, possible AEs, a nd any discomfort participation 
in the study may entail.  This process must be  documented in the subj ect’s source record.  
Each subject must provide a signed and dated IC F before any study-related (nonstandard of care) 
activities are performed.  The or iginal and any amended signed and dated consent forms must

those who did not undergo screening) in the study .  For those subjects subsequently excluded 
from enrollment, the reason(s) fo r exclusion is to be recorded. 
The Investigator/study staff must maintain adequate and accurate  records to enable the conduct 
of the study to be fully documented and the study data to be subsequently  verified.  Essential 
documentation includes, but is not limited t o, the IB, signed protocols and amendments, 
IRB/REB/IEC approval letters (dated), signed Form FDA 1572 and Financial Disclosures, 
signed ICFs (including subject confidentiality information), drug dispensing and accountability 
records, shipping records of investigational product and study-related materials, signed 
(electronically), dated and completed CRFs, a nd documentation of CRF corrections, SAE forms 
transmitted to the Sponsor, or designee, and not ification of SAEs and related reports, source 
documentation, normal laboratory values, decoding procedures for blinde d studies, curricula 
vitae for study staff, and all relevant corre spondence and other documents pertaining to the 
conduct of the study. All essential documentation will be retained by the Investigator for at least 2 years after the date 
the last marketing application is approved for the drug for the indicati on for which it is being 
investigated and until there are no pending or contemplated marketing applications; or, if no application is to be filed or if  the application is not approved for such indication, until 2 years 
after formal discontinuation of c linical development of the drug.  
The Investigator must notify the Sponsor and obt ain written approval from the Sponsor before 
destroying any clinical study documents or images (eg, scan, radiograph, ECG tracing) at any time.  Should an Investigator wish to assign the study records to another party or move them to 
another location, advance written notice will be given to Pharmacyclics.  Pharmacyclics will 
inform the Investigator of the date that st udy records may be destroyed or returned to 
Pharmacyclics.

approval of, any change in the maintenance of  the foregoing documents if the Investigator 
wishes to move study records to another location or assign responsibility fo r record retention to 
another party.  If the Investigat or cannot guarantee the archiving requirements set forth herein at 
his or her study site for all su ch documents, special arrangement s must be made between the 
Investigator and the Sponsor to store such docum ents in sealed containers away from the study 
site so that they can be returned sealed  to the Investigator  for audit purposes. 
12.7. Case Report Forms and Record Maintenance 
CRFs will be used to collect the clinical 
study data and must be completed for each enrolled 
subject with all required study data  accurately recorded such th at the information matches the 
data contained in medical records (eg, physicians ’ notes, nurses’ notes, cl inic charts and other 
study-specific source documents).  Authorized study site personnel (ie, listed on the Delegation 
of Authority log) will complete CRFs designe d for this study according to the completion 
guidelines that will be provided.  The Investig ator will ensure that the CRFs are accurate, 
complete, legible, and completed as soon as reasonably possible, after completion of each 
subject’s visit.  At all times, the Investigator  has final responsibil ity for the accuracy and 
authenticity of all clinical data. 
The CRFs exists within an electronic data capt ure (EDC) system with controlled access managed 
by the Sponsor or its authorized representative for this study.  Study staff will be appropriately 
trained in the use of CRFs and application of el ectronic signatures before the start of the study 
and before being given access to th e EDC system.  Original data a nd any changes of data will be 
recorded using the EDC system, with all changes tracked by the system and recorded in an 
electronic audit trail.  The Investigator attests th at the information contai ned in the CRFs is true 
by providing electronic signature wi thin the EDC system.  After database lock, the Investigator 
will receive a copy of the subject data (eg, paper, CD, or other appropriate media) for archiving 
at the study site. 
12.8. Investigational Study Drug Accountability 
Ibrutinib and any comp
arator used must be kept  in a locked limited access room.  The study drug 
must not be used outside the context of the protocol.  Under no circumstances should the 
Investigator or other site pe rsonnel supply ibrutinib or compar ator to other Investigators, 
subjects, or clinics or allow supp lies to be used other than as di rected by this protocol without 
prior authorization from the Sponsor. 
Accountability records for ibru tinib and any comparator must be maintained and readily 
available for inspection by representatives of  the Sponsor and are open to inspections by 
regulatory authorities at any time.

2. Subject identification number 
3. Lot number(s) of ibrutinib or comparator dispensed for that subject 
4. Date and quantity of drug dispensed 
5. Any unused drug returned by the subject 
At study initiation, the monitor will evaluate and a pprove the site’s proced ure for investigational 
product disposal/destruction to ensu re that it complies with the Sponsors’ requirements.  If the 
site cannot meet the Sponsors’ requirements fo r disposal/destruction, arrangements will be made 
between the site and the Sponsor or its repres entative, for return of  unused investigational 
product.  Before disposal/destruction, final drug accountability and reconciliation must be 
performed by the monitor. 
All study supplies and associated documentation w ill be regularly reviewed and verified by the 
monitor.

Pharmacyclics, Inc. Proprietary and Confidential 112 b. Tumor Tissue: Either unstained slides (minim um of 10 slides, preferably 15-30 or a paraffin block) must be sent to the central laboratory for determination of DLBCL subtype 
within 3 weeks of enrollment. The tumor sample(s) can be archiv al tissue from original diagnosis , from relapsed or refractory d isease, or a fresh (recent) biopsy, if done to 
confirm eligibility for this study.   
c. Adverse Events:  Adverse events are collected from consent thro ugh 30 days after the last dose of study drug. DLT assessment wi ndow is Part 1 starting from Cycle 1 Day 1 to 
predose Cycle 2 Day 1 (=22 days).  Laboratory samples drawn pre- dose on Cycle 2 Day 1 need to be reviewed prior to dosing. 
d. Concomitant medications are coll ected from within 14 days before the first dos e through 30 days after the last dose of study dr ug. 
e. Physical Exam: A complete physical examinat ion performed at Screening, Day 1 of each Cycle, Respons e Assessments, and Safety Fo llow-up will include, at a minimum, 
the general appearance of the subject, height (screening only) and weight, and examination of the skin, eyes, ears, nose, throa t, lungs, heart, abdomen , extremities,  lymphatic 
system. The musculoskeletal and nervous system s may be included if clinically indicated.  A symptom-directed  physical exam may be perfomed at all other visits. 
f. Vital signs (blood pressure, hear t rate, respiratory rate, and temperature) will be assessed after the subject has rested in th e sitting position for ≥3 minutes.  
g. ECG:  12-lead ECG will be done in triplicate ( ≥1 minute apart).  The calculated QTc average of the 3 ECGs must  be <470 msec for eligibility.  Subjects should be in a supine 
position and resting for at least 10  minutes before ECGs.  Unscheduled ECG’s may be performed at the investigator’s discretion,  particularly in subject with arrhythmic 
symptoms (eg, palpitations, lightheadedness) or new dyspnea.  
h. Bone Marrow Biopsy:  A unilateral bone marrow as pirate and biopsy  must be obtained at screening or up to 28 days before the fi rst administration of study drug. Subjects who 
have a bone marrow aspirate and biopsy resu lt since completion of their last therapy for DLBCL may use those bone marrow result s in lieu of the baseline bone marrow 
aspirate/biopsy required for this study, provided the biopsy/aspi rate was done < 28 days of first dose of study drug. Thereafte r, bone marrow aspirate and biopsy will only be 
required to confirm any complete remissi on if result was positive at screening. 
i. Optional Tumor Biopsy: Where possible, tumor biopsies will be obtained by core needle biopsy or surgery prior to treatment in C ycle 1 only.  Subjects with partial or complete 
response who later develop recurrent disease are encouraged to have an additional biops y at time of recurrenc e. Snap freeze and  store tissue biopsies at -80°C. 
j. During Cycles 1-6, modified he matology blood draws should include at a minimu m, white blood cells, neutrophils, bands if presen t, and platelets, and should be checked twice 
weekly on days 4 or 5, 11 or 12, 15, and 18 or 19 (e.g. on Monday (day 1) & Thursday or Friday (Day 4 or 5), or Tuesday (Day 1)  & Friday or Saturday (Day 4 or 5) to assure 
that counts are checked every 3 to 4 days). 
k. Serum chemistry: sodium, potassium, chloride, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine,  glucose, calcium, total protein, albumin, AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin, 
lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), phosphate, uric acid, magnesium  and bicarbonate 
l. Hepatitis serologies include Hepatitis C antibody, Hepatitis B surface antigen, Hepatitis B surface antibody and Hepatitis B co re antibodyViral load by PCR must be confirmed 
negative in equivocal cases for subjects who are Hepatitis B core antibody positive, Hepatitis B surface antigen positive, Hepa titis B surface antibody positive (unless 
immunized) or Hepatitis C antibody positive. 
m. Pregnancy Test: Must be done in accordance with Celgene Revlimid REMS™ program guidelines and protocol  Section 7.1.2.4 for women of childbe aring potential only.   
n. T/B/NK cell count (ie, CD3+, CD 4+, CD8+, CD16/56+, CD19+) done at predose on Day 1 of Cycle 1 and then on Day 1 of Cycles 2, 3,  and 6; at Response Assessments post 
treatment period and at Safety Follow-up visit. 
o. Biomarker Blood Sample: done at predose Cycl e 1 Day 1, Day 8 and Day 15; Cycle 2 Day 1 and Day 8, Cycle 3 Day 1, Cycle 6 Day 1,  at each posttreatment  response assesment 
and at Safety Follow-up visit. 
p. Phamacokinetic samples will be drawn for all subjects in Part 2 of protocol according to the schedule in Table 17.   
q. Urinalysis: pH, ketones, specific gravity , bilirubin, protein, blood, and glucose 
r. CT and PET or PET/CT:  A CT scan (with co ntrast unless contraindicated) of the neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis and any other d isease sites (eg, extremity) and a PET or 
PET/CT scan are required for the pretreatment tumor assessment within 21 days of the first dose.  During treatment, CT scans wi ll be done for tumor asse ssments within 4 days 
of the end of Cycles 3, (-4 days of Cycl e 4 Day 1) and ±4 days of the end of Cycl e 6 and then at each response assessment time point thereafter, until PD  or use of alternative 
antineoplastic therapy.  PET or PET/CT is mandatory to confirm a CR.  In the event that CT contrast is contraindicated, MRI of the abdomen and pelvis and CT of the chest and 
neck without contrast may be performed as an alternative.  Lesion s in anatomical locations that ar e not well visualized by CT m ay be measured at baseline from MRI instead and 
should continue to be measured from MRI until  disease progression. 
s. Survival status is to assess survival and the use of alternative antineoplastic therapy and stem cell transplant up to 1 year a fter the first dose of the last subject enrolled.  
Survival status will be assessed approximately every 12 weeks (±7 days) from last dose.

Pharmacyclics, Inc. Proprietary and Confidential 117 Appendix F: Risks of Fetal Exposure, Pregnanc y Testing Guidelines and Acceptable Birth 
Control Methods 
Risks Associated with Pregnancy 
The use of lenalidomide in pregnant females a nd nursing mothers has not been studied nor has 
the effect of lenalidomide on human eggs and sper m.  Lenalidomide is structurally related to 
thalidomide.  Thalidomide is a known human tera togenic active substance that causes severe 
life-threatening birth defects.  An embryofetal development st udy in animals indicates that 
lenalidomide produced malformations in the offspring of female monkeys who received the drug 
during pregnancy.  The teratogenic effect of lenalidomide in humans cannot be ruled out.  
Therefore, a risk minimization plan to  prevent pregnancy must be observed. 
All study participants must be register ed into the mandatory Revlimid REMS® program, and be 
willing and able to comply with the requirements of Revlimid REMS®. 
Criteria for females of childbearing potential (FCBP)  
This protocol defines a female of childbearing potential as a sexually mature female who: 1) has not undergone a hysterectomy or bilate ral oophorectomy or 2) has not been naturally 
postmenopausal for at least 24 consecutive months (ie, has had menses at any time in the preceding 24 consecutive months). 
The investigator must ensure that
 
• Females of childbearing potential comply with the conditions for pregnancy risk 
minimization, including confirmation that sh e has an adequate level of understanding 
• Females NOT of childbearing potential acknow ledge that she understa nds the hazards and 
necessary precautions associated with the use of lenalidomide 
• Male patients taking lenalidomide acknowledge  that he understands that traces of 
lenalidomide have been found in semen, that he  understands the potential teratogenic risk if 
engaged in sexual activity with a female of childbearing potential or pregnant female, 
and that he understands the need for the use of a condom even if he has had a vasectomy, 
if engaged in sexual activity with a female of  childbearing potential or pregnant female.   
Contraception  
Females of childbearing potential (FCBP) enrolled in this protocol must agree to use two reliable 
forms of contraception simultaneously or to practice complete abstinence from heterosexual 
intercourse during the following time periods related to this study:  1) for at least 28 days before 
starting lenalidomide; 2) throughout  the entire duration of lenalidomide treatment; 3) during dose 
interruptions; and 4) for at least 28 days after lenalidomide discontinuation.

IND 102,688   30 September 2014 
Pharmacyclics, Inc. Proprietary and Confidential 118 The two methods of reliable contraception must include one highly effective method and one 
additional effective (barrier) me thod.  FCBP must be referred  to a qualified provider of 
contraceptive methods if needed.  The following are examples of highly effective and additional 
effective methods of contraception:   
• Highly effective methods: 
o Intrauterine device (IUD) 
o Hormonal (birth control pills, injections, implants) 
o Tubal ligation 
o Partner’s vasectomy 
• Additional effective methods: 
o Male condom 
o Diaphragm 
o Cervical Cap 
Implants and levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine systems are associ ated with an increased risk 
of infection at the time of in sertion and irregular vaginal bl eeding. Prophylactic  antibiotics 
should be considered particularly  in patients with neutropenia. 
Pregnancy Testing  
Medically supervised pregnancy tests with a minimum sensitivity of 25 mIU/mL must be 
performed for females of childbearing potential, including females of chil dbearing potential who 
commit to complete abstinence, as outlined below. 
Before starting lenalidomide 
Female Patients: FCBP must have two negative pregnancy tests (s ensitivity of at least 25 mIU/mL) prior to 
prescribing lenalidomide.  The first pregnancy te st must be performed within 10–14 days prior to 
prescribing lenalidomide and the second pregnancy test must be performed within 24 hours prior 
to prescribing lenalidomide.  The patient may not receive lenalidomide until the Investigator has 
verified that the results of these pregnancy tests are negative. 
Male Patients: 
Must agree to practice complete abstinence or agree to use a condom dur ing sexual contact with 
pregnant females or females of childbearing potential throughout the entire duration of 
lenalidomide treatment, during dose interrupt ions and for at least 3 months following 
lenalidomide discontinuation, even if he has undergone a successful vasectomy.

IND 102,688   30 September 2014 
Pharmacyclics, Inc. Proprietary and Confidential 119 During study participation and for 28 days  following lenalidomide discontinuation  
Female Patients: 
• FCBP with regular or no menstrual cycles must agree to have pregnancy tests weekly for the 
first 28 days of lenalidomide treatment, including  dose interruptions and then every 28 days 
throughout the remaining duration of lenalidomid e treatment, including dose interruptions, 
at lenalidomide discontinuation, and at Da y 28 following lenalidomide discontinuation.  
If menstrual cycles are irregular, the pregna ncy testing must occur weekly for the first 
28 days of lenalidomide treatment, including dose interruptions, and then every 14 days 
throughout the remaining duration of lenalidomid e treatment, including dose interruptions, 
at lenalidomide discontinuation, and at Day 14 and Day 28 following lenalidomide 
discontinuation.   
• At each visit, the Investigator must confirm with the FCBP that she is continuing to use two 
reliable methods of birth contro l at each visit during the time th at birth control is required.   
• If pregnancy or a positive pregnancy test does occur in a study  patient, lenalidomide must be 
immediately discontinued. 
• Pregnancy testing and counseling must be perfor med if a patient misses her period or if her 
pregnancy test or her menstrual bleeding is abnormal.  Lenalidomide treatment must be 
temporarily discontinued during this evaluation. 
• Females must agree to abstain from breastfeedin g during study participation and for at least

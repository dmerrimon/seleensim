PII Amendment H September 2015       CONFIDENTIAL   Page   3  1.0   Purpose 
The purpose of this protocol is to provide continued access of the Edwards SAPIEN 3 
Transcatheter Heart Valve Model 9600TFX (20, 23, 26, 29 mm) and delivery systems 
(transfemoral, transapical and transaortic), which are intended for use in patients with 
symptomatic, calcific, severe aortic stenosis for patients with intermediate risk for standard 
aortic valve replacement. 
2.0  Device Description 
The Edwards SAPIEN 3 transcatheter heart valve (THV) is comprised of a balloon-expandable, 
radiopaque, cobalt-chromium alloy frame, trileaflet bovine pericardial tissue valve, and 
polyethylene terephthalate (PET) internal fabric skirt, and a PET outer skirt. The valve is treate d 
according to the Edwards ThermaFix process, and is packaged and terminally sterilized in 
glutaraldehyde. 
Refer to the instructions for use for descriptions of the following SAPIEN 3 Edwards accessory 
devices: 
Edwards Commander Delivery System, models 9610TF23, 9610TFX23, 9610TF29 for
the transfemoral procedure
Edwards Expandable Introducer Sheath Set, models 9610ES14, 916ES23 for the
transfemoral procedure
Edwards Certitude Delivery System, models 9620TA23, 9620TA26, and 9620TA29  for
transapical and transaortic procedure
Edwards Certitude Introducer Sheath Set, models 9620IS18 and 9620IS21 for the
transapical and transaortic procedure
Ascendra Balloon Aortic Valvuloplasty Catheter model 9100BAVC for the transapical
and transaortic procedure
Crimper, model 9600CR
3.0  Background 
A total of 1,0 78 intermediate risk patients were enrolled in the PARTNER II SAPIEN 3 
intermediate (PIIS3i) cohort. Edwards has received strong feedback from the PARTNER 
Community that further research for both the SAPIEN 3 valve as well as the intermediate risk 
group is warranted to expand the device and procedural related learning as well as to address 
the needs of patients that are in the screening process or could present at the investigating 
centers.   

The PARTNER II –US-IDE Trial S3i CAP     Edwards Lifesciences 
PII Amendment H September 2015       CONFIDENTIAL   Page   4  4.0  Design 
All data from Screening through 1 year; including adverse events (AE) will be entered in The 
Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) and the American College of Cardiology (ACC), TVT 
Registry™  (TVTR) . Data excerpts of the TVTR data entered by enrolling sites will be transferred 
to the Sponsor on a monthly basis . All patient personal identifie rs will be redacted prior to data 
transfer . The annual one year follow-up visit data will be entered in the TVTR, and data from 
years 2-5 will be obtained from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) via 
TVTR linkage. 
Edwards or designee will monitor the patient 30-day follow up visit data. 
The TVTR is a benchmarking tool developed to track patient safety and real-world outcomes 
related to transcatheter valve replacement, repair procedures and emerging treatments for valve 
disease patients. It is designed to monitor the safety and efficacy of these new technologies for 
the treatment of valve disease. 
Patients in PIIS3i continued access must be covered by Medicare. This will enable Edwards to 
link to the CMS database for long term follow-up through 5 years.  No other insurance provider 
will be accepted for enrollment .  
Participating sites will maintain patient files in the same manner as they do for the initial 
Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) study patient populations. Refer to the PARTNER II 
protocol version 6.0 or most current protocol version for additional information. 
5.0  Continued Access Protocol Endpoints 
The primary safety and effectiveness endpoint is stroke , aortic valve reintervention and death at 
the 30-day follow-up visit. 
Summary statistic reports for the primary safety and effectiveness endpoint will be provided at 
the 1 year follow-up visit .   
Secondary safety endpoints will include death, annular dissection, aortic dissection, major 
access vascular site complication, unplanned vascular surgery or intervention, and 
retroperitoneal, GI and GU bleeds, and bleeding at access sites collected through the 30 day 
follow-up visit .  
Summary statistic reports for individual rates of death and all other safety endpoints included in 
the TVTR data collection form in sections F, I, and on the adjudicated event rates (section J) for 
stroke and aortic reintervention will be provided. 
6.0  Sites 
Up to a total of 60 actively enrolling sites. 

The PARTNER II –US-IDE Trial S3i CAP     Edwards Lifesciences 
PII Amendment H September 2015       CONFIDENTIAL   Page   5  7.0  Enrollment 
A total o f 1,078 intermediate risk patients were implanted in the PIIS3i cohort. Enrollment in this 
continued access protocol will consist of up to a maximum of 2,000 PIIS3i patients. Patients 
enrolled under the PIIS3i continued access will become part of the TVTR database.  Edwards 
will receive data excerpts from the TVTR on a monthly basis through the first year of patient 
registration and then yearly through follow-up year 5. Edwards will provide annual reports to the 
FDA based on this data through year 5 of follow up.  
To ensure enrollment is representative and balanced across study sites, no site will enroll more 
than 15 percent of the total enrollment or implant approach. 
8.0  Continued Access Study Duration 
Enrollment will continue up to a maximum of 2,000 continued access patients. 
Initial Enrollment: January 2015 
Anticipated Enrollment Close: August 2016

listed throughout this section are an overview of key assessments; however, please refer to the 
TVTR data collection form for all required assessments.  
10.1   Screening 
The screening phase is designed to meet the following objectives: 
1.Determine patient eligibility, operability risk assessment and access site for THV
procedure.

The PARTNER II –US-IDE Trial S3i CAP     Edwards Lifesciences 
PII Amendment H September 2015       CONFIDENTIAL   Page   8  2.Patient informed consent.
10.1.0 Screening Assessments
Screening assessments should be completed within 30 days of patient
enrollment unless otherwise specified.
Medical history
STS Risk Score
NYHA classification
Syntax Score (conducted in the absence of prior revascularization)
Hemoglobin, Platelet Count, Creatinine
Transthoracic (TTE) or transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE)
Cardiac Imaging (ECHO, CTA, or cardiac MRI) with 3D reconstruction of the
aortic root to determine aortic valve annulus area must be completed within
180 days of patient enrollment.
Reference S3 Sizing Guide (Protocol 6.0, Appendix U) for sizing
recommendations
Thoracic x-ray, an abdominal angiogram, and CT angiograms or MRI, and
with complete visualization of both iliacs and femorals to the aorta.  In the
situation where patients have compromised renal function that precludes
the use of contrast agents, MR imaging may be used as an alternative. CT
scans are strongly recommended, particularly in patients with femoral
arteries less than 7 mm; (must be within 180 days of patient enrollment).
Patients with previously documented inadequate femoral access
[(Iliofemoral vessel characteristics that would preclude safe placement of
22F or 24F introducer sheath (14F or 16F for S3) such as severe
obstructive calcification, severe tortuosity or minimum average vessel size
less than 6 mm (20, 23 and 26 mm THV minimum vessel size ≥ 5.5 mm /
29 mm THV minimum vessel size ≥ 6.0 mm for S3) ] don’t require repeat
testing.
Left and right cardiac catheterization to assess the severity of aortic stenosis
and severity of coronary artery disease if applicable (< 90 days before
procedure)
Data must be entered in the STS/ACC TVT Registry. Data in the TVTR data forms will be 
included in monthly data transfers from the TVTR to the Sponsor. All patient personal identifiers 
will be redacted prior to data transfer. 
10.2  Case Review Process 
Patients must meet the fundamental enrollment criteria of severe, symptomatic, calcific aortic 
stenosis. Upon meeting these eligibility criteria, the site investigators (per site heart team 
assessment) shall then determine the patient’s risk for operative morbidity and mortality.
Patients determined to be operable must have a STS score of 4 - 8% or a defensible

process.   
The PARTNER II trial operations include a case review process prior to enrollment of patients. 
After screening assessments are made, the patient’s qualifying criteria are reviewed by the case 
review board where the members will assess patient eligibility and access approach. Upon 
approval, the patient may be enrolled into the study. The case approval decision will be 
documented by the Sponsor .  
The study procedure should occur within two weeks (14 days) of case approval.

SYNOPSIS  
Title of Study:  A Phase  1, Open -Label Study to Assess the Effects of Talazoparib on Cardiac 
Repolarization in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors  
Protocol Identifier:   MDV3800- 14 
Phase of Development:   1 
Number of Patients:  At least 30  patients  
Study Centers:   Approximately 12  (United States) 
Study Objectives:  
Primary : 
• To evaluate the  effect of talazoparib on cardiac repolarization  in patients with advanced solid tumors 
by assessing  the corrected QT interval (QTc)  
• To assess the relationship between plasma talazoparib concentrations and the QTc  
Secondary : 
• To evaluate the  safety and tolerability  of talazoparib  
• To evaluate the effect of talazoparib on non- QT interval electrocardiogram ( ECG ) parameters (heart 
rate, RR, PR, QRS intervals, and ECG morphology)  
• To evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of talazopa rib 
Methods:   This is a phase 1, open -label safety study of talazoparib (also known as MDV3800, BMN 673), 
a poly(ADP -ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor in development for  the treatment of a variety of human 
cancers .  This study is designed to evaluate the effects of talazoparib on cardiac repolarization in at least 
30 patients with advanced solid tumors with no available  standard treatment options .  Eligible patients will 
have  continuous 12 -lead ECG recordings at baseline (day  -1); time-matched PK  samples  and continuous 
ECG recordings will be obtained at days  1, 2, and 22.  Patients will fast for at least 6 hours before  and 
2 hours after  the dose on days  1 and  22.   
On day - 1, patients will have continuous 12 -lead EC G recording, starting at time  0 (baseline, corresponding 
to the dosing time on day  1) for 6  hours.  On day 1, continuous 12 -lead ECG recording will start 45  minutes 
before administration of talazoparib 1  mg at time  0, and continue through 6  hours postdose.   Blood samples 
for PK will be collected predose  and at 1, 2, 4, and 6 hours postdose.  On day  2, a 30 -minute continuous 
12-lead ECG recording and a blood sample for PK will be obtained before the day  2 dose of talazoparib.   
On days  3 to 21, talazoparib a t 1 mg/day every day will be self -administered orally.  On days  8 and  15, 
patients will return for general assessments.   
On day 22, patients will return for steady -state continuous 12 -lead ECG recording s, starting 45  minutes 
before the dose of talazoparib, and continu ing for 6  hours  postdose.  PK sampl es will be collected predose  
and at 1, 2, 4, and 6  hours  postdose .   
ECG data from continuous 12- lead ECG recordings will be submitted for independent central review.  After 
reviewing for data qual ity, triplicate 10-second ECGs will be extracted from a 5 -minute extraction window at 
each planned time point, beginning 15 minutes before each PK collection time point.  ECG recordings will 
be analyzed for measurement of RR, PR, QRS, and QT intervals and evaluation of ECG morphology.   
Study periods include screening, baseline (day  -1), a 22- day treatment period, and safety follow -up.  Safety 
follow -up will occur approximately 30 days after the last dose of study drug or before initiation of a new 
antineop lastic therapy, whichever occurs first.  For further talazoparib treatment, patients  must  enroll  and 
initiate continued talazoparib treatment in a separate open -label extension study  within 30  days after the last 
dose of study drug, and in this case, safety follow -up will be omitted  and an ECG will be obtained at the time 
of enrollment in  the open -label extension study .

Statistical Methods:  
Safety Analyses :   
All safety analyses will be performed using the safety population, defined as all patients who receive any 
amount of talazoparib.  The safety of talazoparib will be evaluated by the analysis  of incidence of serious and 
nonserious adverse event s, severity of adverse events,  incidence of dose modifications and of permanent 
treatment discontinuation due to adverse events, and incidence of new clinically significant changes in vital 
signs, ECGs, and clinical laboratory values .  Drug exposure will be summarized using descriptive statistics.   
Adverse events will be coded to preferred term and system organ class using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) and classified by severity using the National Cancer Institute Common 
Terminolo gy Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) , version  4.  The number and percentage of patients with 
adverse events will be presented by MedDRA system organ class and preferred term, relationship to study 
treatment, severity, seriousness, and outcome (eg,  leadin g to permanent treatment discontinuation).   
Treatment -emergent safety data will be collected from day  1 (the first dose of study drug) through 
approximately 30 days after the last dose of study drug, before initiation of a new antineoplastic therapy, or 
enrollment in the open -label extension study, whichever occurs first.   
Laboratory values will be classified by severity using the CTCAE.  Laboratory shift tables of baseline results to each subsequent visit will be produced as appropriate.   
ECG  Analyses :  The primary endpoints are to evaluate  the effects of talazoparib on Fridericia’s corrected QT 
interval (QTcF); and to evaluate the relationship between  the plasma concentration of talazoparib and the 
change from baseline in QTc, corrected for heart rate b ased on Fridericia’s correction  formula  (ΔQTcF) .  
Bazett’s correction formula (ΔQTcB)  will also be evaluated .  Changes from time -matched baseline 
measurements will be calculated and data will be summarized in tabular and graphic formats for each study visit.  Assessments include absolute QTc prolongation with QTc >  450 msec, > 480 msec, and >  500 msec 
and change from baseline in QTc with QTc increase >  30 msec and > 60 msec.  The means of each 
measurement of RR, PR, QRS, and QT intervals will be utilized for statistical analyses.  Heart rate will be used to assess QTc endpoints.   
ECG morphology and changes from baseline for each pla nned postbaseline time point will be summarized 
for all patients.  The proportion of patients with any postbaseline change in ECG morphology and the proportion of patients with each type of abnormality will also be summarized.   
PK Analyses :   
Summary data of plasma talazoparib concentrations will be presented in tabular and graphic formats for each 
time point.  PK parameters such as time to maximum concentration (T max), maximum plasma concentration 
(Cmax), and area under the concentration -time curve (AUC) on days  1 and  22 will be calculated.  In addition, 
the PK data from this study will be combined with PK data from other studies to define a population PK model, which will be reported separately.   
PK-Pharmacodynamic Analyses:  
The correlation between changes in ECG interval measurements from time- matched baseline and the plasma 
talazoparib concentration will be investigated using a linear mixed -effects model.   
Efficacy Analyses:   
No efficacy analysis is planned in this study.   
Sample Size Considerations:    
A sample size of at least 30  evaluable patients  will provide 80% power to reject the null hypothesis if the 
mean change from baseline in QTcF is ≥  10 msec with a 95% one- sided alpha, assuming a standard deviation 
of 20  msec.  Patients will be enrolled until 30  patients complete day  22, miss ≤  5 consecutive  doses of study 
drug, have technically adequate ECG recordings, and have at least 80% of specified PK samples collected 
representing all 3  days of observation (days  1, 2, and 22).

1 INTRODUCTION  
1.1 Background 
Talazoparib (also known as MDV3800, BMN 673) is a potent, orally bioavailable, small 
mo
lecule poly(ADP -ribose) polymerase ( PARP ) inhibitor in development for the treatment 
of a variety of human cancers.  PARP inhibitors including talazoparib exert cytotoxic effects by 2 mechanisms:  inhibition of PARP1 and PARP2 enzyme activity, and PARP trapping, a process in which PARP protein bound to a PARP inhibitor does not readily dissociate from DNA, preventing DNA repair, replication, and transcription ( Murai  
et al, 2012).  
Single- agent talazoparib has demonstrated potent antitumor effects in human cancer cell lines 
ha
rboring gene mutations that compromise DNA repair, as well as in mouse tumor xenograft 
models ( Murai  et al, 2014; Shen  et al, 2013; Cardnell  et al, 2013).  Antitumor effects have 
also been observed in phase 1 studies of talazoparib monotherapy in patients with cancer.   
This card
iac safety study will evaluate the effects of talazoparib on cardiac 
electrophysiology, in particular cardiac repolarization as assessed by the corrected QT interval (QTc).   
1.2 Summary of Relevant Clinical Experience With Talazoparib 
Approximately 319 patients have received talazoparib in company-sponsored studies as of 
30 Nov  2015, including 3 studies in solid tumors and 1 in hematologic malignancies.  Studies 
include a phase 1 study ( PRP-001) in advanced solid tumors, a phase 2 study (673- 201, 
ABRAZO) in advanced breast cancer , and a phase 3 study ( 673-301, EMBRACA) in locally 
advanced and/or metastatic breast cancer.   
1.2.1 Efficacy  
PRP-001 is a phase 1, open-label, safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), and dose- escalation 
(0.025-1.1 mg/day) and expansion (1  mg/day) study of talazoparib monotherapy 
in 110 patients with advanced or recurrent solid tumors with DNA repair deficiencies.  As of 
30 Nov  2015, objective responses (complete response, partial response) per Response 
Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, version  1.1 (RECIST  1.1) were observed in patients 
with breast (8  of 18 [44.4%]), ovarian/primary peritoneal (12 of 25 [48%]), and pancreatic 
(2 of 13 [15.4%]) cancers with deleterious germline breast cancer susceptibility gene 
(BRCA) mutations.  Clinical benefit (complete response, partial response, or stable disease 
≥ 24 weeks) was observed in 13 of 18 patients (72.2%), 19 of 25 patients (76%), and 4 of 
13 patients (30.8%), respectively .  In patients with small cell lung cancer, objective responses 
were observed in 2  of 23 patients (8.7%) and clinical benefit reported in 6  of 23 patients 
(26.1%).

1.2.2 Safety  
The safety of talazoparib is based on phase 1 and 2 studies in patients with advanced cancer.   
Aggregate safety data from 3  of the 5  company-sponsored clinical studies (phase 1 studies 
PRP-001 and PRP -002, and phase 2 study 673-201; 214 patients  total ; data as of 
30 Nov  2015) provide the basis for the most common treatment- emergent adverse events.  
The most common adverse events associated with talazoparib (> 20%) were 
myelosuppression (anemia, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia), gastrointestinal toxicity (nausea, 
diarrhea, vomiting), and fatigue.  The most common grade 3 or higher adverse events and serious adverse events were associated with myelosuppression.  A total of 25 of 214 patients had an adverse event that led to death (12 associated with malignancies, 3  disease 
progression, 2 each lung infection and pneumonia, and 1 each cardiorespiratory arrest, neutropenic sepsis, renal impairment, dyspnea, hypoxia, and respiratory failure).  Of these events, none was assessed as related to study drug.  Eight of 214 pati ents discontinued study 
drug due to an adverse event.   
In the ongoing phase 3 study 673-301, an adverse event of veno- occlusive disease of the liver 
leading to death was assessed as related to talazoparib by the investigator.   Additional information on the clinical safety of talazoparib is provided in the talazoparib 
investigator brochure.   
1.2.3 Pharmacokinetics  
The PK of talazoparib as a single agent was evaluated in 142  adult patients with cancer, 
including 109 patients with solid  tumors (PRP -001) and 33 with hematologic malignancies 
(PRP -002).  Doses of 0.025 mg to 2 mg were administered orally as a single dose or as 
once daily doses .  This dose range bracketed the 1  mg/day dose used in ongoing safety and 
efficacy studies, and pro vided a framework for assessing dose linearity.  As the PK of 
talazoparib was similar in patients with solid tumors and hematologic malignancies, and no 
differences were apparent between males and females, the results are summarized collectively.   
Oral ab sorption of talazoparib was rapid and independent of dose after administration of 
single or once- daily doses.  Peak talazoparib concentrations were generally reached 
approximately 1 to 8 hours postdose.  Exposure increased approximately dose-proportionally 
with increasing doses.  At 1 mg/day, the mean half- life was approximately 2 days; the mean 
apparent volume of distribution was 415  L, indicating extensive extravascular distribution.  
Steady state was reached in approximately 2  to 3 weeks with daily administration.   
Apparent oral clearance (CL/F) of talazoparib appeared to be dose linear, with a mean CL/F across doses of approximately 5 L/h.  Renal excretion was a major elimination pathway for 
unchanged parent talazoparib.  Following oral administration, 44% to 90.6% of the dose was recovered in urine as unchanged parent drug over 24 hours at steady state for doses up to 1 mg/day.  Mean renal clearance ranged from 1.38  L/h to 4.96 L/h, independent of dose, 
suggesting linear urinary elimination kinetics.   

Medivation, Inc.  Talazoparib  Protocol MDV3800- 14/TRIO029 
19 AUG 2016  – v2.0 FINAL   Page 11 of 58 
Following repeated administration at 1 mg/day, talazoparib accumulated approximately 
2.4-fold relative to a single dose.  At steady state, the mean maximum plasma concentration 
(Cmax) was 21.0 ng/mL, the mean plasma trough concentration (C min) was 3.72 ng/mL, and 
the mean area under the concentration -time curve (AUC) was 202  ng ●h/mL.   
PK data from a food-effect study showed that food had no effect on the extent of absorption of talazoparib (AUC), but decreased the rate of absorption (C
max was 46% lower and time to 
Cmax [Tmax] was 2.63 hours later); however this reduction in the rate of absorption following 
a single dose is not clinically relevant because talazoparib accumulates 2.4 -fold at steady 
state after 1  mg once-daily dosing.  Furthermore, in nonclinical pharmacology studies, AUC 
or C min appeared  to drive efficacy , not C max; therefore, talazoparib can be taken with or 
without food.  Talazoparib is being administered without regard to food in ongoing safety and efficacy studies.   
A preliminary population PK analysis using data from patients in studies PRP-001 and 
PRP-002 assessed the effects of renal function on the PK of talazoparib.  In patients with 
moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance [CL
CR] 30-59 mL/min), the talazoparib 
CL/F was  decreased by 44% from normal, resulting in higher talazoparib exposure.   
The effects of hepatic impairment on talazoparib PK have not been studied.   
The potential for talazoparib to affect the PK of other drugs was assessed through in vitro 
experiments and is described in Section  1.3.2.  Additional information on the PK of 
talazoparib is provided in the investigator brochure.   
1.3 Summary of Relevant Nonclinical Experience With Talazoparib  
1.3.1 Nonclinical Pharmacology of Talazoparib 
The cytotoxic activity of talazoparib was demonstrated in cell culture, and antitumor effects 
were demonstrated in mouse xenograft models.   
In cell -free enzyme assays, talazo parib inhibited PARP1 and PARP2 catalytic activity 
(Wang  et al, 2016).  Talazoparib was approximately 3.4- to 8.3- fold more potent than other 
PARP inhibitors in clinical development (veliparib, rucaparib, olaparib) in inhibiting PARP1 
catalytic activity (Shen et al, 2013).  In addition, talazoparib was approximately 40-fold more 
potent than olaparib in stimulating the formation of stable PARP1- DNA complexes 
(Murai  et al, 2014).   
In tissue culture studies, talazoparib was cytotoxic to cancer cell lines harboring gene mutations that compromise DNA repair pathways, including MX- 1 (BRCA1 -mutant) and 
MDA- MB-468 (PTEN -mutant) mammary cancer cells, LNCaP (PTEN - and ATM- mutant) 
and PC- 3 (PTEN -mutant) prostate cancer cells, and HCT -116 (MLH-1- mutant) colorectal 
tumor cells.  The half- maximal inhibitory concentration (IC
50) values of talazoparib in these 
cancer cell lines were in the single-digit nanomolar or subnanomolar range ; in contrast, the 
IC50 values of talazoparib in MRC -5 normal human primary lung cancer cells and other 
tumor cell lines without reported DNA repair -related mutations were higher (250  nM to 

Medivation, Inc.  Talazoparib  Protocol MDV3800- 14/TRIO029 
19 AUG 2016  – v2.0 FINAL   Page 12 of 58 
> 1000 nM ).  The talazoparib IC 50 for growth inhibition of Capan-1 human pancreatic cancer 
cells (BRCA2 -deficient)  was 50 - to over 2000- fold lower than the other PARP inhibitors 
tested ( Shen  et al, 2013 ).  The higher potency of talazoparib relative to the other PARP 
inhibitors is thought to be due to the more potent PARP trapping activity seen with 
talazoparib as opposed to inhibition of PARP catalytic acti vity ( Shen  et al, 2015).   
Consistent with its antitumor effects in tissue culture, talazoparib demonstrated potent antitumor activity in mouse xenograft models of small cell lung cancer and breast cancer 
(Cardnell et  al, 2013; Shen  et al, 2013).   
Additio nal information on the nonclinical pharmacology of talazoparib is provided in the 
talazoparib investigator brochure.   
1.3.2 Nonclinical PK and Metabolism  
PK studies in rats and dogs show that talazoparib oral bioavailability was >  43% in rats and 
> 51% in dogs.  A Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) study in dogs demonstrated that the 
capsule formulation used in clinical studies is approximately 2-fold more bioavailable than the suspension formulation used in nonclinical studies.  In general, talazoparib displays greater than or approximately dose-proportional increases in exposure in rats and dogs with no evidence of sex differences.    
Studies of [
14C]-talazoparib in rats and dogs indicate rapid absorption, wide distribution 
(greater than total body water), and nearly complete elimination of drug substance (>  90%) 
by 7 days.  Fecal elimination was the main route of elimination in both species, and renal excretion was moderate (21 -26%).  In a study in rats, [
14C]-talazoparib was widely 
distributed, reaching maximum levels 1  to 4 hours postdose.  Excluding the gastrointestinal 
tract, the highest radioactivity levels were observed in liver and kidney (and the eye uveal tract in albino rats).  Tissue radioactivity levels were greater than blood levels in the target organs of talazoparib toxicity (bone marrow, spleen, and thymus) through 7 days.  Metabolic profiling of plasma, urine, and feces samples indicated that [
14C]-talazoparib is largely 
cleared via excretion of unchanged parent drug and metabolized to a minor extent via oxidation and dehydrogenation.   
In vitro metabolism studies in rat, dog, and human hepatic microsomes demonstrated that 
[
14C]-talazoparib has high metabolic stability (>  90%) over 2 hours.  A minimal extent or 
a lack of metabolism for [14C]-talazoparib was observed in the presence of freshly isolated 
mouse, rat, dog, and human hepatocytes or cryopreserved human hepatocytes.  Talazoparib does not appear to be a substrate of any major cytochrome P450 (CYP450) metabolizing enzyme.   
Mean binding to human plasma proteins is 78.7%; therefore, it is unlikely that talazoparib 
will demonstrate clinically significant drug -drug interactions related to displacement from 
plasma protein binding sites.  At therapeutic exposures, talazoparib does not markedly induce 
or inhibit CYP450 enzymes.  Therefore, it is unlikely that talazoparib will demonstrate clinically significant CYP450 inhibition - or induction -based drug- drug interactions when 
coadministered with corresponding substrates.  At therapeutic exposures, talazoparib does 

Medivation, Inc.  Talazoparib  Protocol MDV3800- 14/TRIO029 
19 AUG 2016  – v2.0 FINAL   Page 13 of 58 
not markedly induce or inhibit any transporters.  Therefore, it is unlikely that talazoparib will 
demonstrate clinically significant drug transporter inhibition -based drug–drug interactions 
when coadministered with corresponding substrates.   
Because talazoparib is a substrate for P -glycoprotein (P- gp) and breast cancer resistance 
protein (BCRP), plasma talazoparib concentrations may increase or decrease when 
coadministered with P -gp or BCRP inhibitors or inducers, respectively.  Guidelines for 
concomitant use of talazoparib inhibitors or inducers of P -gp or inhibitors of BCRP are 
provided in Section  7.3.   
Additional information on the nonclinical PK and drug metabolism of talazoparib is provided in the investigator brochure.   
1.3.3 Nonclinical Toxicology  
Safety pharmacology, single- and repeat -dose toxicity, genotoxicity, embryo- fetal 
development, and in vitro phototoxicity studies were conducted to evaluate the nonclinical 
toxicology profile of talazoparib.  Repeat- dose toxicity/toxicokinetic studies were conducted 
with talazoparib utilizing the intended oral route of administration in mice, rats,  and dogs.  A 
repeat -dose study with talazoparib was conducted in BALB/c nude mice to select doses and 
exposures for the mouse xenograft studies.   
Five-day, 28-day, and 13- week repeat -dose GLP toxicity and toxicokinetic studies with 
28-day recovery periods were conducted in the rat and dog.  The major findings are as 
follows:   
• Dose -dependent pancytopenia with bone marrow hypocellularity and depletion of 
lymphoid tissue in multiple organs was observed and considered possibly due to exaggerated pharmacology of talazoparib based on the higher (relative to baseline) poly(ADP- ribose) (index of PARP1/2 activity) tissue levels in these organs.  The 
hematologic findings were partially reversible and may be readily monitored in the clinic.  The toxicities that resu lted in mortality in dogs (0.1 mg/kg/day) and some rats 
(1 mg/kg/day) occurred at AUC
0-24 exposures that were > 0.8- and 4-fold higher, 
respectively, than the exposure at the recommended human dose of 1 mg/day.  The toxicities were mainly due to septicemia  that resulted from the severe bone marrow 
and lymphoid depletion.   
• A dose-dependent increased incidence of gastrointestinal tract findings of apoptosis/necrosis in the stomach and duodenum was observed.  Additional findings at higher doses included reversible villous atrophy and increased apoptosis throughout the gastrointestinal tract, most notably in the small intestine.  Gastrointestinal tract toxicities of enteropathy and villous atrophy caused mortality in rats at 3.0  mg/kg/day.  Exposures at 3.0 mg/kg/day are significantly higher than the 
exposures at the recommended human dose.   

Medivation, Inc.  Talazoparib  Protocol MDV3800- 14/TRIO029 
19 AUG 2016  – v2.0 FINAL   Page 14 of 58 
• Additional findings at the high dose (≥  1 mg/kg/day) in the 5-day GLP study in rats 
included focal necrotic changes in the ovarian follicular atresia and hepatocyte 
necrosi s of the liver.  These findings were not observed in the 28-day or 13- week 
repeat -dose studies in rats.   
• Atrophy and/or degenerative changes in testes and epididymis and effects on the seminiferous tubules were observed in rats and dogs; the severity correlated with both dose and duration of treatment.   
There were no talazoparib -related effects on respiratory or central nervous system parameters 
after a single oral administration to rats (safety pharmacology studies), or on cardiovascular parameters and electrocardiogram (ECG) evaluations after a repeat -dose oral administration 
in dogs (repeat-dose toxicity studies).  Talazoparib had no effect on ophthalmologic end points in rats or dogs in repeat-dose toxicity studies.  Talazoparib was not mutagenic in a bacterial reverse mutation assay, but consistent with the genomic instability of its primary pharmacology, was clastogenic in an in vitro chromosomal aberration assay and in an in vivo micronucleus assay, indicating the potential for genotoxicity in humans .  Talazoparib caused 
fetal malformations, structural variations, and death in an embryo-fetal development study in rats.  Based on an in vitro 3T3 neutral red uptake assay, which results in a high incidence of false positives, talazoparib is potentially p hototoxic in humans.  In conclusion, the main 
nonclinical toxicologic findings were early hematologic changes, and subsequent bone marrow and lymphoid organ depletion; focal atrophy and degeneration of testes, epididymis, and seminiferous tubules; and dose-dependent apoptosis/necrosis in the gastrointestinal tract and liver after repeat -dose talazoparib.  These findings are consistent with the exaggerated 
pharmacology of talazoparib and its tissue exposure pattern.  Additional information on the toxicology of talazoparib is provided in the talazoparib investigator brochure.   
1.4 Cardiac Safety of Talazoparib 
In vitro, talazoparib has an estimated IC
50 for inhibition of hERG channels of > 100 μM 
whereas in humans taking 1 mg once daily the mean C max at steady state is 0.055 μM (free 
Cmax of 0.0117 μM ), indicating low potential for significant inhibition.  In vivo, ECG 
evaluations were conducted in 28-day and 13-week toxicity studies in beagle dogs over a range of doses.  No talazoparib-related changes in PR, QRS, QT, QTc , or RR intervals, or 
heart rate were observed on days 3 or 24 of the dosing phase (28-day study) or day 90 of the dosing phase or day 26 of the recovery phase (13-week study).  No rhythm abnormalities or qualitative ECG changes were observed during qualitative assessment of the ECGs in either study.   
In phase 1 study PRP-001 (110 patients), ECGs were recorded at baseline, at 3 to 4 hours 
postdose on days  1 and 35 (dose- escalation phase) or at day  1 of cycle  2 (dose-expansion 
phase) , and at the end of treatment (<  10 days after  the last  dose of talazoparib ), if clinically 
indicated.  ECG interval data were collected retrospectively from these recordings.  Of the 96 patients with ECG recordings at baseline and postbaseline based on draft data, 1 patient 
had a postbaseline QTcF  (Fridericia’s correct ed QT interval ) > 500 ms ec; 1 had a 
postbaseline QTcF > 480 msec to  ≤ 500 msec; and 9 (9.4% ) had a postbaseline 

Medivation, Inc.  Talazoparib  Protocol MDV3800- 14/TRIO029 
19 AUG 2016  – v2.0 FINAL   Page 15 of 58 
QTcF  > 450 msec to  ≤ 480 msec.  One patient had an increase in QTcF from baseline 
> 60 ms ec and 6 (6.3%) had an increase in QTcF  from baseline > 30 ms ec to ≤ 60 ms ec.   
These observations indicate that talazoparib has a low risk of QT prolongation or 
proarrhythmic effects.  This study will  further assess the effects of talazoparib on cardiac 
electrophysiology.   
1.5 Talazoparib Benefits and Risks Assessment  
The dose of talazoparib in this study, 1 mg/day, is supported by noncl inical studies and 
phase 1 studies in patients with advanced malignancies.  Antitumor activity has been 
observed, and warrants further exploration in a larger patient population.  The expected adverse events with talazoparib include myelosuppression, gastrointestinal toxicity, fatigue, and alopecia.  Hepatotoxicity, febrile neutropenia, and neutropenic sepsis are potential risks per the investigator brochure S ection  7.  The activity of talazoparib is being evaluated in 
multiple indications.  The benefit- risk profile of talazoparib is not yet well characterized.

3 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
3.1 Overall Study Design and Plan:  Descrip tion 
This is a phase 1, open-label safety study of talazoparib, a PARP  inhibitor in development for 
the treatment of a variety of human cancers.  This study is designed to evaluate the effects of talazoparib on cardiac repolarization in at least 30  patients with advanced solid tumors with 
no available standard treatment options .  Eligible patients will have  continuous 12- lead ECG 
recordings at ba seline (day  -1); time -matched PK  samples and continuous ECG recordings 
will be obtained at days 1, 2, and 22.  Patients will fast for at least 6  hours before and 2 hours 
after the dose on days 1 and 22.   
On day -1, patients will have continuous 12- lead EC G recording, starting at time  0 (baseline, 
corresponding to the dosing time on day 1) for 6 hours.  On day 1, continuous 12- lead ECG

19 AUG 2016  – v2.0 FINAL   Page 16 of 58 
recording will start 45  minutes before administration of talazoparib 1 mg  at time  0, and 
continue through 6 hours postdose.  Blood samples for PK will be collected predose and at 1, 
2, 4, and 6 hours postdose.  On day 2, a 30- minute continuous 12-lead ECG recording and a 
blood sample for PK will be obtained before the day 2 dose of talazoparib.   
On days 3 to 21, talazoparib a t 1 mg/day every day will be self-administered orally.  On 
days 8 and 15, patients will return for general assessments.   On day 22, patients will return for steady- state continuous 12- lead ECG recordings,  starting 
45 minutes before the dose of talazoparib , and continuing for 6  hours postdose.  PK samples 
will be collected predose and at 1, 2, 4, and 6 hours postdose .   
ECG data from continuous 12-lead ECG recordings will be submitted for independent central 
review.  After reviewing for data quality, triplicate 10 -second ECGs will be extracted from a 
5-minute extraction window at each planned time point, beginning 15 minutes before each PK collection time point.  ECG recordings will be analyzed for measurement of RR, PR, QRS, and QT intervals and evaluation of ECG morphology.   
Study periods include screening, baseline (day -1), a 22-day treatment period, and safety 
follow-up.  Safety follow-up will occur approximately 30 days after the last dose of study drug or before initiation of a new antineoplastic therapy, whichever occurs first.  For further talazoparib treatment, patients must enroll and initiate continued talazoparib treatment in a separate open -label extension study within 30 days after the last dose of study drug, and in 
this case, safety follow -up will be omitted  and an ECG will be obtained at the time of 
enrollment in the open-label extension study.

3.3 Blinding  
All treatments  will be open label.  All patients, study site personnel (including investigators), 
and sponsor staff and its representatives will be unblinded to treatment identity.  Central 
review ers for ECG data are blinded to patient  identifiers , treatment, and visit.   
3.4 Duration of Study  
The total duration of this study will be approximately 1 year .   
3.5 Discussion of Study Design  
The maximum tolerated dose of talazoparib is 1 mg/day ( de Bono et  al, 20 13) and is defined 
as the recommended human dose.  The talazoparib 1  mg/day dose is being used in this study 
and is currently being evaluated in ongoing studies in patients with breast cancer , as 
discussed in Section  1.  This study will assess the risk of QT prolongation with serial ECG 
recordings and time- matched PK measurements.  Supratherapeutic doses cannot be 
administered safely, so a traditional  thorough QT study is not feasible.  Because talazoparib 
is clastogenic in vitro and in vivo, it is not possible to conduct the study in healthy volunteers.  Therefore, adult patients with advanced solid tumors, representative of the population being evaluated in current and planned phase 2 and 3 studies, will be enrolled.   
With chronic dosing at 1  mg/day, plasma talazoparib concentrations reach steady state in 
2 to 3 weeks, with about a 2.4-fold accumulation relative to a single dose.  Therefore, 
a 22-day dosing duration will allow most  patients to reach s teady -state concentrations of 
talazoparib.  ECG recordings will be obtained with time -matched PK samples over a wide 
range of plasma talazoparib concentrations, after both acute and chronic dosing.   The primary endpoint s are to evaluate the effects of talazoparib on QTcF  and to evaluate the 
relationship between the plasma concentration of talazoparib and the change from baseline in 
QTc, corrected for heart rate  based on the QTcF correction formula  (∆QTcF) .  Bazett’s 
correction formula ( ΔQTcB) will also be evaluated .  Continuous ECG recordings will be 
obtained at baseline (day -1), and continuous ECG recordings and blood samples for PK will 
be obtained on days 1, 2, and 22 (steady state) to obtain ECG record ings over a range of 
plasma concentrations of talazoparib.  Patients will fast for at least 6  hours before and 
2 hours after the dose on days  1 and 22 to minimize the variability of C
max.  For the PK -
pharmacodynamic ( PD) analysis, a linear mixed effects modeling approach will be  used to 
examine the relationship between the changes from baseline in QTc intervals ( ΔQTcF and 
ΔQTcB) and plasma concentration of talazoparib .   
No tumor assessments or other efficacy measures will be collected in this study.  Disease 
assessments may  be performed according to the standard of care at the study site.

5 ENROLLMENT AND STUDY PROCEDURES 
Study enrollment and procedures are summarize d in the following subsections.  The study 
periods will include screening, treatment (basel ine on day -1 and 22 days of treatment), and 
safety follow-up.  The timing of all study procedures  is provided in the schedules of activities 
(Appendix 1 , Appendix 2 ).  Signed informed consent must be obtained before performing 
any study-specific procedures.  The study manua l contains the information needed for 
registering patient status (eg, assigning screening and enrollme nt numbers, indicating screen 
failure, and end of treatment).   
5.1 Screening Period 
The screening period will be from day -29 thro ugh day -2.  For the purposes of this study, 
there will be no day 0.   
5.1.1 Informed Consent 
Study site personnel must explain to potential study participants all aspects of the study, 
including all scheduled visits and activities .  Study site personnel must obtain signed 
informed consent before any study-specific proc edures are conducted unless the procedures 
are part of routine standard of care, and must  document the informed consent process in the 
patient’s source documents.   
The informed consent form may be signe d before the 28-day screening period.   
5.1.2 Screening Identification Numbers 
After obtaining signed informed consent, study site personnel w ill assign a screening 
identification (ID) number for each potential st udy participant per the study manual.   
For patients who provide informed consent and subsequently do not meet eligibility criteria 
or withdraw consent, study site personnel wi ll document the screen failure or consent 
withdrawal in the patient’s source documents.   The documentation will include demographics 
and medical history, the reason for screen failu re, the eligibility criteria reviewed, and 
procedures performed.

5.1.3 Screening Procedures  
Screening procedures are listed in the schedule o f activities in  Appendix 1.  All proced ures 
must be completed within 28 days before day -1 except as noted .   
The investigator will assess the eligibi lity of each patient.  All screening procedure results 
and relevant medical history must be available before eligibility can be determined.  All 
inclusion criteria must be met and none of the exclusion criteria may apply.  No eligibility waivers will be gr anted.   
After a  patient is screened and the investigator determine s the patient is eligible for 
enrollment, study site personnel will request that the  sponsor or designee approve the 
enrollment.   
5.2 Treatment Period  
5.2.1 Treatment Period Visit Windows  
All treatment period visits have a visit window of ±3 days (ie,  3 days before or after the 
given day), except for days -1, 1, and 2.   5.2.2 Treatment Period Procedures 
5.2.2.1 Enrollment  
Study site personnel should receive enrollment approval from the sponsor or designee before 
proceeding with enrollment.  An enrollment ID number will be assigned per the study 
manual.  This number will be used to identify the patient for the remainder of the study.  
Patients must initiate study treatment within  3 business days after enr ollment  approval.   
5.2.2.2 Treatment Period Study Visit Procedures 
Day -1 is the day of baseline, and day 1 is the day of the first dose of study drug.   
Specified study procedures will be performed at each clinic  visit according to the schedule of 
activities ( Appendix 2).  The ECG , blood pressure, and PK collection schedule is  as follows  
(Appendix 3 ): 
• Continuous ECG recordings are obtained by attaching the Holter monitor at the start of the collection time point on days -1, 1, 2, and 22.  Blood pressure (after supine for 5 minutes) will be obtained 15 to 20 minutes before each  PK collection time point.  
After blood pressure is obtained, the patient should remain supine for 10 to 15 minutes (for continuous ECG recording) before blood samples for PK are 
collected.   
• On day - 1 (baseline), EC G recording will start at time  0 (corresponding to the dosing 
time on day 1) and continue for 6  hours.   

Medivation, Inc.  Talazoparib  Protocol MDV3800- 14/TRIO029 
19 AUG 2016  – v2.0 FINAL   Page 22 of 58 
• Patients will fast for at least 6 hours before and 2 hours after the day 1 dose.   
• On day 1 (within 72 hours of time 0 on day -1, corresponding to the clock time of the 
first baseline ECG measurement ), ECG recording will start at least 45  minutes before 
the first dose of study drug at time 0, and continue for 6 hours postdose.  Blood samples for PK  will be collected  immediately befo re the first dose of study drug and 
at 1, 2, 4, and 6 hours postdose.  Patients may resume eating after the 2-hour postdose PK sample is collected .   
• On day 2, at 24 hours after the first dose of study drug, ECG recording will start at least 30 minutes  before time  0 and continue until the day 2 dose.  The day 2 dose 
should be taken at approximately the same clock time ( within 1  hour of time 0) as the 
day 1 dose.  Blood samples for PK  will be collected before the dose.   
• Patients will fast for at least 6 hours before and 2 hours after the day 22 dose.   
• On day 22, ECG recording will start at least 45  minutes before administration of the 
day 22 dose at time  0, and continue for 6 hours postdose.  The day  22 dose should be 
taken at approximately the same clock time (within 1 hour of time 0) as the day 1 dose.  Patients may resume eating after the 2-hour postdose PK  sample is collected .  
Blood samples for PK will be collected immediately before the dose of talazoparib and at 1, 2, 4, and 6 hours postdose .   
5.2.3 Unsch eduled Visit  Procedures 
Unscheduled visits may be performed anytime to assess or follow up adverse events or at the request of the patient or investigator.  The date and reason for the unscheduled visit must be recorded in the source documentation.   
A rev iew of adverse events and changes to concomitant medications or treatments (including 
herbal therapies) occurring since the previous visit should be performed at unscheduled 
visits.   
Unscheduled visit procedures are listed in  Appendix 2.  Other study procedures may be 
performed as clinically appropriate.   
5.3 Permanent Treatment Discontinuation  
Permanent  treatment discontinuation is defined as cessation of study drug treatment 
administration.  After permanent discontinuation, safety follow-up will be per Section  5.4, 
unless the patient withdraws consent for further follow -up.   
Temporary  treatment interruption (eg, due to an adverse event) is not  considered permanent 
discontinuation.   
The primary reasons for which patients permanently discontinue  study treatment are listed in 
Table  1.   

Medivation, Inc.  Talazoparib  Protocol MDV3800- 14/TRIO029 
19 AUG 2016  – v2.0 FINAL   Page 23 of 58 
Table  1: Primary Reasons for Permanent Treatment Discontinuation  
Reason  Comment  
Adverse event or intercurrent illness  Any intolerable adverse event that cannot be ameliorated by 
the use of adequate medical intervention or that in the opinion of the investigator or sponsor would lead to undue risk if 
study treatment were continued  (eg, severe drug -induced liver 
injury [ Section  8.2.1.1.1 ] or MDS/AML [Table  3]).  Refer to 
Section  8.3.1 .  May or may not be related to disease 
progression.    
Disease progression  Study drug treatment may be discontinued  for disease 
progression based on investigator  assessment .   
Administration  of prohibited 
concomitant therapy  Refer to Section  7.2.   
Patient decision  Patients may permanently discontinue treatment anytime for 
any reason.   
Investigator decision  Protocol treatment may be discontinued if the investigator considers  it is in the patient’s best interest.   This category 
should be selected if adverse event, disease progression, or administration of prohibited concomitant therapy do not apply 
and the patient preferred to continue treatment.    
Major noncompliance with protocol  The medical monitor or investigator may request permanent 
treatment discontinuation in the event of a  major protocol 
deviation, lack of cooperation, or noncompliance.   
Loss to follow -up Refer to Section  5.5.   
Sponsor discontinuation of study The sponsor reserves the right to terminate the study anytime for any reason as described in Section  13.6.  The sponsor will 
terminate this study following completion of the study objectives, or earlier if deemed necessary.   
AML, acute myeloid leukemia; MDS, myelodysplastic syndrome.   
 
5.4 Safety Follow -Up 
Safety follow-up will occur approximately 30 days after the last dose of study drug or before 
initiation of a new antineoplastic therapy, whichever occurs first.  For further talazoparib treatment, patients must enroll and initiate continued talazoparib treatment  in a separate 
open-label extension study within 30 days after the last dose of study drug, and in this case, the safety follow -up will be omitted and an ECG will be obtained at the time of enrollment in  
the open- label extension study.   
In the event that a new antineoplastic therapy is initiated before safety follow -up occurs 
(eg, a physician not associated with protocol MDV3800-14 initiates the treatment, and study site personnel are not aware of the treatment until afterwar d), safety follow-up should be 
scheduled as soon as possible.   
Safety follow- up procedures are listed in  Appendix 2.   

Medivation, Inc.  Talazoparib  Protocol MDV3800- 14/TRIO029 
19 AUG 2016  – v2.0 FINAL   Page 24 of 58 
If treatment is discontinued due to an  adverse event or serious adverse event, the event(s) 
must be followed up as described in Section  8.3.9.   
For patients who refuse to come to the clinic for safety follow-up, telephone contact must be 
attempted and documented to review for adverse events through approximately 30 days after the la st study drug treatment , before initiation of a new antineoplastic therapy , or enrollment 
in the open-label extension study, whichever occurs first.  If the patient does not respond to telephone calls, the procedures for loss to follow-up in Section  5.5 should be followed.   
5.5 Loss to Follow- Up 
Every reasonable effort must be made to contact any patient apparently lost to follow-up during the course of the study to complete study- related assessments and record outstanding 
data.  Following unsuccessful telephone contact, the following should occur:   
• An effort to contact the patient by mail using a  method that provides proof of receipt 
should be attempted.   
• Alternate contacts are permissible if the patient is not reachable (eg,  primary care 
providers, referring physician, relatives).  
• Such efforts should be documented in the patient’s source documents.   
If all efforts fail to establish contact, the pati ent will be considered lost to follow -up.   
Patients who withdraw consent will be considered lost to follow-up for analysis purposes.

at least  6 hours before and 2 hours after the dose on days 1 and 22.  Patients  may resume 
eating after the 2-hour postdose PK sample is collected .  On other days, talazoparib may be 
taken with or without food.  The days 2 and 22 doses should be taken at approximately the 
same clock time ( within 1 hour of time 0) as the day 1 dose.  On days 3 to 21, patients should 
self-administer talazoparib orally  once daily at approximately the same time each morning .  
The capsules should be swallowed whole with a glass of water without chewing, dissolving, or opening them.   
Patients should not make up missed or vomited doses; dosing should resume on the next 
calendar day unless otherwise instructed.   
Dose modifications due to adverse events are described in Section  8.2.1.   
Talazoparib is considered a cytotoxic and clastogenic agent; precautions regarding 
appropriate secure storage and handling must be used by healthcare professionals, including personal protective clothing, disposable gloves, and equipment ( Goodin et  al, 2011 ).  Patients 
should be advised that oral anticancer agents are toxic substances and that (other than the patient) caregivers should always use gloves when handling the capsules.   
6.3 Treatment Compliance  
Accountability for the study drug capsules will be performed to document compliance with 
the dosing regimen.  Patients will be asked to bring all used and unused study drug bottles to study visits.  Study site personnel must make reasonable efforts to obtain used and unused study drug bottles from patients who do not routinely return them at study site visits.  Unreturned capsules will be considered to have been taken.

7.1 Prior Medications  
All prior cancer treatments, other medications taken within 30 days before day -1, and any 
medications prescribed for chronic or intermittent use during the study, or dose adjustments of these medications, must be recorded on the case report form and in the patient’s source documents.   
7.2 Concomitant Therapy  
Concomitant therapy (noninvestigational products) includes any concomitant medications 
(Section  7), blood transfusions, or radiotherapy used between day  -1 and the end of 
treatment.   
Patients will be instructed to consult with the investigato r before taking any additional 
medications (including over -the-counter medications).  Supportive medications may be 
provided prophylactically or therapeutically per i nvestigator discretion, with the exception 
that granulocyte- colony stimulating factor ( G-CSF) is  only allowed in the rescue setting.  
Palliative radiation is allowed but the combination of radiation therapy and talazoparib has 
not been studied.   
Concomitant therapies will be assessed at all clinic visits  and must be recorded on the 
appropriate case report form.  If the use of any medication during the study is due to 
an adverse event, the adverse event must be recorded on the adverse event case report form 
and in the patient’s source documents.   
Prohibited me dications are described in  Table  2.  Deviation from these guidelines should 
occur only if absolutely necessary for the well-being of the patient, and the medical monitor 
is to be notified to determine whether continued treatment with study drug is permitted.   Study drug must be permanently discontinued upon initiation of any other antineoplastic 
therapy.  Patients who discontinue treatment due to initiation of such therapy will complete safety follow -up per Section  5.4.

For rechallenge, dose modification may be required per  Table  4.   
ALT, alanine aminotransferase; AST, aspartate aminotransferase; ULN, upper limit of normal.   
 
Study drug should be withheld pending investigation of alternative causes of liver injury 
(Table  6).  When withholding study drug, follow-up should continue for possible 
drug-induced liver inj ury until the liver test abnormalities resolve to baseline grade.   
Rechallenge may be considered at a 1  dose level reduction per  Table  4 if an alternative cause 
for the abnormal liver tests (ALT, AST, total bilirubin) is discovered and the laboratory abnormalities resolve to normal or baseline values.  The investigator and sponsor should discuss and agree with any decision to rechallenge.   
Following rechallenge, patients should be closely monitored for signs and symptoms of 
hepatitis and/or abnormal liver test results.  If signs or symptoms consistent with hepatitis 
recur or the withholding criteria in  Table  5 are met after rechallenge, study drug treatment 
should be permanently discontinued.   
Rechallenge should not occur when the etiology of the liver test abnormalities is considered 
drug induced.

Study drug should be discontinued permanently if  all of the following 4 criteria are met 
(ie, potential severe drug-induced liver injury/Hy’s law case):  
$67RU$/7LQFUHDVHVWR  3 times ULN (> 5 × ULN if baseline ALT/AST is 
> 3 × ULN)

Alkaline phosphatase value does not reach 2 times  ULN (note: in the presence of elevated 
alkaline phosphatase associated with bone  metastases, gamma glutamyl transferase 
[GGT] should be tested and the results should be within th e reference range) 
Medivation, Inc. Talazoparib Protocol MDV3800-14/TRIO029 
19 AUG 2016 – v2.0 FINAL  Page 32 of 58 
No alternative cause explains the combination of the above laboratory abnormalities; 
important alternative caus es include, but are not limited to the following: 
x Hepatobiliary tract disease 
x Viral hepatitis (eg, hepatitis A/B/C/D/E, Ep stein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, herpes 
simplex virus, varicella, toxoplasmosis, and parvovirus) 
x Congestive heart failure, hypotension, or any cause of hypoxia to the liver causing 
ischemia 
x Exposure to hepatotoxic agents/drugs or hepatotoxins, including herbal and dietary 
supplements, plants, and mushrooms 
x Alcoholic hepatitis 
x Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) 
x Autoimmune hepatitis  
x Wilson disease and hemochromatosis 
x Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency  
If an alternative cause for hepatotoxicity is id entified or less stringent  conditions developed 
than those noted above, then it should be dete rmined (based on the patient population and/or 
severity of the hepatotoxicity or event)  whether study drug should be withheld or 
permanently discontinued as appropriate for the safety of the patient.  When study drug is 
temporarily withheld or permanently discont inued due to a potent ial drug-induced liver 
injury, a period of close observation is to co mmence until the liver test abnormalities return 
to baseline or normal values.  The evaluations listed in  Table 7 should be performed.

As drug-induced liver injury is a diagnosis of exclusion, it is im portant to initiate 
investigation of alternative cau ses for abnormal liver tests, which may include consultation 
with a hepatologist.  The medical monitor s hould be contacted for questions regarding 
adequate follow-up tests.

8.2.2 Overdose Management 
The medical monitor must be contacted in the event of a study drug overdose.  An overdose 
is defined as any dose greater th an the protocol-specified dose of  talazoparib.  In the event of 
an overdose, treatment with study drug shoul d be stopped and genera l supportive measures 
initiated, taking into consideration the mean half -life is 50 hours.  No antidote to overdose is 
known.   
All overdose events are to be  reported within 24 hours of  awareness by the study site 
according to Section 8.3.6 whether or not the overdose is associ ated with an adverse event.   
8.2.3 Reproductive Considerations 
Female Patients 
Female patients of childbearing potential must have a negative pregna ncy test at screening 
(serum tested centrally) and safety follow-up (urine or serum tested locally or using a 
centrally provided kit), and must avoid pre gnancy during the study.  Urine pregnancy tests 
must have a limit of detection of 25 IU/L (or equivalent units) for human chorionic 
gonadotropin.  If a pregnancy test is positive, study drug treatment will be discontinued.   
Female patients of childbearing potential must use a highly effective form of birth control 
from the first dose of study drug through 45 days  after the last dose of study drug, defined as 
follows:   
x Established use of an oral , intravaginal, or transdermal combined (estrogen and 
progestogen containing)  hormonal contraception asso ciated with inhibition of 
ovulation

Male Patients  
Male patients must use a condom when having sex with a pregnant woman or with a woman 
of childbearing potential from the first dose of study drug through 105 days after the last dose of study drug.  Contraception should be considered for a nonpregnant female partner of childbearing potential.   
Details regarding the reporting procedures to follow in the event of pregnancy are provided 
in Section  8.3.10.  Instructions regarding sperm or egg donation and breastfeeding are 
provided in Section  4.1.   
8.3 Adverse Event Definitions and Reporting  
8.3.1 Adverse Event Definitions 
Definitions are provided in this section for adverse events, events of special interest, serious adverse events, treatment -emergent ad verse events, suspected unexpected serious adverse 
reactions (SUSARs), and unexpected adverse events.   
Adverse events:  An adverse event is any unfavorable and unintended sign (including 
an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use 
of a study drug, whether or not related to the study drug.   
Examples of adverse events include the following: 
• A worsening, excluding minor fluctuations, in the nature, severity, frequency, or duration of a pre-existing condition 
• Develo pment of an intercurrent illness during the study 
• Development of symptoms that may or may not be related to the use of a concomitant medication or investigational product 
• Injury or accidents:  If a  medical condition is known to have caused the injury or 
accident, the medical condition and the accident should be reported as 2  separate 
medical events (eg,  for a  fall secondary to dizziness, both “dizziness” and “fall” 
should be recorded separately)  
• An investigational abnormality (eg, laboratory parameter, vital sign, ECG) only if the abnormality is considered clinically significant by the investigator based on at least one of the following criteria: 
– Induces clinical signs or symptoms  
– Requires active intervention  
– Requires interruption or discontinuation of study drug 
An adverse event does not  include the following: 
• Medical or surgical procedures (eg, surgery, endoscopy, tooth extraction, transfusion); the condition that leads to the procedure is an adverse event  

Medivation, Inc.  Talazoparib  Protocol MDV3800- 14/TRIO029 
19 AUG 2016  – v2.0 FINAL   Page 35 of 58 
• Pre-existing diseases or conditions present or detected before the start of study drug 
administration that do not worsen 
• Situations where an untoward medical event has not occurred (eg,  planned 
hospitalization for an elective procedure)  
Serious adverse events :  Any adverse event that meets any of the c riteria in  Table  8 as 
determined by the investigator or sponsor.   
Table  8: Criteria for Serious Adverse Events 
Criterion  Comm ent 
Results in death  Death is an outcome, not an adverse event.  The 
primary adverse event resulting in the death 
should be identified.   
Is life threatening (immediate risk of death from 
the adverse event as it occurred)  Does not include an event that  hypothetically 
might have caused death if it were more severe.   
Results in or prolongs an existing inpatient hospitalization  For hospitalizations for surgical or diagnostic procedures, the illness leading to the surgical or diagnostic procedure will be identified as the 
serious adverse event (not the procedure).   
Results in persistent or significant incapacity or 
substantial disruption of the ability to conduct 
normal life functions  Permanent or substantial disruption of a person’s 
ability to conduct normal life functions.   
Results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect   
Important medical events which jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above  Examples include drug -induced bronchospasm 
requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpat ient hospitalization, and 
the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.   
Source:  US Code of Federal Regulations:  21 CFR 312.32 [75  FR 59961]  
 
Treatment -emergent adverse events :  Adverse events observed following administration of 
the first dose of study drug.   
Unexpected adverse events:  Adverse events for which the nature or severity is not consistent 
with the reference safety information.   
Suspected unexpected serious adver se reactions (SUSARs) :  Adverse events assessed as 
serious, related, and unexpected, which are subject to expedited reporting to regulatory authorities and study investigators.   
Adverse events of special interest:  Adverse events of special interest are a ny adverse events 
(serious or nonserious) identified for ongoing monitoring during the study and require rapid communication by the investigator to the sponsor as described in Section  
8.3.6.

19 AUG 2016  – v2.0 FINAL   Page 36 of 58 
8.3.2 Adverse Event Reporting  
Safety reporting to regulatory authorities , ethics committees, and investigators will be 
implemented according to global and country specific regulations.   
To elicit adverse event reports from patients, the study site personnel should question the 
patient in a general way without suggesting specific symptoms.   
All patients who experience an adverse event will be evaluated at appropriate time intervals 
until the event resolves or stabilizes.  At the conclusion of the study, the investigator and 
medical monitor will assess unresolved adverse events and determine if additional follow -up 
is warranted as described in Section  8.3.9.   
All adverse events, whether or not related to the study drug, must be fully and completely documented on the appropriate form and in the patient’s source documents.  In addition, any adverse event resulting in permanent treatment discontinuation must be recorded on the appropriate case report form as well as documented in the patient’s source documents.  
Adverse event terms should include a diagnosis, as available, in preference t o listing the 
individual signs and symptoms.  If the diagnosis is not known, the investigator should record each sign and symptom as an individual adverse event.   
Overdose and pregnancy in the patient or partner will be reported as described in 
Sections 8.2.2 and 8.3.10, respectively .   
8.3.2.1 Adverse Event Reporting Periods 
Collection and reporting of adverse event information will begin at the time the patient signs informed consent for serious adverse events and  following the first dose of study drug for 
nonserious adverse events and will continue for all events through safety follow-up (approximately 30 days after the last dose of study drug),  before initiation of a new 
antineoplastic therapy, or enrollment in the open-label extension study, whichever occurs first ( Figure  2).  Additional reporting instructions for serious adverse events are provided in 
Section  8.3.6.

19 AUG 2016  – v2.0 FINAL   Page 37 of 58 
Figure  2: Adverse Event Reporting Periods 
 
 
All adverse events from the time of the first dose of study drug must be documented on the 
adverse event case report form and in the patient’s clinical record .  Any event occurring 
during screening and before the first dose must be documented on the medical history case report form and in the patient’s clinical re cord for any patient who subsequently meets 
eligibility criteria and proceeds to enrollment.   
8.3.3 Assessment of Causal Relationship  
The investigator will assess the relationship of an adverse event to study drug treatment 
according to the criteria in  Table  9 and document the relationship in the patient’s clinical 
record.   
Table  9: Criteria for Determining Causal Relationship to Study Drug  
Relationship  Criteria  
Not Related  A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a 
temporal relationship to drug administration that makes a causal relationship improbable, and/or in which other drugs, chemicals, 
or underlying disease provide plausible explanations.   
Possible A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a 
reasonable time sequence to administration of the drug, but that could also be explained by concurrent disease or other drugs or chemicals.  Information on drug withdrawal may be lacking or un clear.   
Probable  A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a reasonable time sequence to administration of the drug, unlikely to be attributed to concurrent disease or other drugs or chemicals, and that 
follows a clinically reasonable  response on re -administration 
(rechallenge) or withdrawal (dechallenge).

8.3.4 Assessment of Severity (Intensity)  
Severity describes the intensity of a specific adverse event (m ild, moderate, or severe).  The 
particular event may be of relatively minor medi cal significance (such as severe headache).  
Severity is not the same as “serious,” which is based on patient/event outcome or  action 
criteria.   
Investigators will grade the severity of adverse events according to the CTCAE, version 4.  
For terms not spec ified within the CTCAE, the criteria in  Table  10 should be used to 
determine grade of severity.   
Adverse event severity should be recorded in the appropriate section of the adverse event case report form and in the patient’s source documents.   
Table  10: Criteria for Determining the Severity (Intensity) of an Adverse Event  for 
Terms Not Specified in CTCAE  
Grade  Intensity or Severity  Clinical Description  
1 Mild  Asymptomatic or mild symptoms, clinical or diagnostic observations only; intervention not indicated  
2 Moderate  Minimal, local, or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age-appropriate instrumental activities  of daily living  
3 Severe or medically significant Not immediately life -threatening; hospitalization or prolongation of 
hospitalization indicated; disabling; limiting self -care activities of 
daily living  
4 Life-threatening  Life-threatening consequences;  urgent intervention indicated  
5 Death  Death related to adverse event  
Source:  Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v4.0  
 
8.3.5 Adverse Events of Special Interest  
Adverse events of special interest include a diagnosis of MDS or acute myeloid leukemia 
(AML ) (consistent with events observed with olaparib) and abnormal liver test results.  Liver 
test abnormalities that require reporting are the following:  
• AST or ALT ≥  3 times ULN (> 5  × ULN if baseline ALT/AST is >  3 × ULN) and 
total bilirubin >  2 times ULN or INR  > 1.5 
• AST or ALT ≥  3 times ULN with signs and symptoms consistent with hepatitis 
and/or eosinophilia (≥  500 eosinophils/µL) 
Adverse events of special interest occurring during the safety reporting period must be 
reported within 24 hours of awareness by the study site and those occurring after the safety reporting period must be reported within 1 week of awareness, using a serio us adverse event 
report form (contact information provided in Section  8.3.6).    

Medivation, Inc.  Talazoparib  Protocol MDV3800- 14/TRIO029 
19 AUG 2016  – v2.0 FINAL   Page 39 of 58 
Tissue samples and any other supporting data used to enable the diagnosis of MDS or AML 
should be submitted for central review if requested.   
8.3.6 Serious Adverse Event Reporting  
Study site personnel will collect serious adverse event information from the time the patient 
signs the informed consent form through screen failure or safety follow- up (approximately 
30 days after the last dose of study drug),  before initiation of a new antineoplastic therapy, or 
enrollment in the open-label extension study, whichever occurs first.  Serious adverse events reported to the investigator after the safety reporting period should be reported to the sponsor if the investigator assesses the event as related to the study drug  treatment.   
Using a serious adverse event report form  (a sponsor-provided form in the study manual) , all 
serious adverse events must be reported within 24  hours  of the study site personnel’s 
knowledge of the event, regardless of the investigator assessment of the relationship of the event to study drug.   
The contact information for submission of serious adverse even ts, adverse  events of special 
interest, and events of overdose or pregnancy is as follows:  
Name:  ProductLife, Ltd.  
Fax: +1-866-488-3347 (US)  
or designated regional toll -free number  
Backup Fax:  +44 (0) 1223 413689 (United Kingdom)  
Email:  safety@productlife -group.com  
Phone:  +44 (0) 1223 402660  
 The initial report should include, at minimum, the following: 
• Study number (MDV3800-14) 
• Site name and number 
• Investigator name  
• Patient ID number, sex, and age 
• Details of study drug administration 
• The date of the report 
• A description of the serious adverse event (event term, seriousness of the event)  
• Causal relationship to the study drug 
If the patient died, the report should include the cause of death as the event term (with fatal 
outcome) and whether or not the event leading to death was related to study drug treatment , 
as well as the autopsy findings if available.

19 AUG 2016  – v2.0 FINAL   Page 40 of 58 
8.3.7 Clarification in Reporting of Deaths  
Information relating to any death at any time during the study (eg, date and primary cause) 
should be obtained and recorded on the appropriate case report form.   
Fatal events (regardless of relationship to study drug) should be repor ted as serious adverse 
events during the treatment-emergent safety reporting period defined in Section  8.3.2.   
Death per se is not an adverse event but is an  outcome of an  adverse event.  The specific 
cause of death should be reported whenever possible.   
8.3.8 Clarification in Reporting of Disease Progression as an Adverse Event  Term  
Disease progression is expected in this study population and “disease progression” should not 
be reported as an adverse event term.  When clinical disease progression is identified, the specific clinical event that identifie s the disease progression should be reported as the 
adverse event term for standard adverse event and if applicable, serious adverse event reporting.   
8.3.9 Follow- Up of Serious and Nonserious Adverse Events 
All adverse events reported during the study should be followed up at appropriate intervals 
until resolution, or until the event has stabilized, reached a new baseline, or a new 
antineoplastic therapy is initiated (all follow -up results are to be reported to the sponsor or 
designee).   
Adverse events that remain unresolved at the conclusion of the study may continue to be 
monitored if warranted based on clinical assessment by the investigator and medical monitor.   
Patients should be contacted by phone and written requests as appropriate for adverse event follow-up if they do not come to the clinic for safety follow- up as specified in Section  5.4.   
8.3.10 Pregnancy Reporting Procedure  
If a female study participant becomes pregnant between the first dose of study drug and 
45 days after permanent discontinuation of study drug treatment, or if a male study participant impregnates a partner between the first dose of study drug and 105 days after perman ent discontinuation of study drug treatment, the study participant should report the 
pregnancy to the investigator.  The pregnancy is to be reported to the sponsor within 24 hours of awareness by the study site (contact information provided in Section  8.3.6), using the 
provided reporting forms.  The expected date of delivery or expected date of the end of the pregnancy, last menstruation, estimated conception date, pregnancy result, and neonatal data, etc, should be included in this information.   
The investigator will follow the medical status of the mother, as well as the fetus, and will 
report the outcome to the sponsor.

8.4 Clinical Laboratory Tests  
Routine clinical laboratory tests (hematology, serum chemistry) will be performed according 
to the schedules of activities ( Appendix 1, Appendix 2).  Samples will be stored until the 
specified analyses are completed and then will be destroyed in accordance with standard laboratory prac tice and applicable local regulations.   
A list of the required routine clinical laboratory tests and other evaluations is provided in Table  11.  All samples for laboratory analysis must be collected, prepared, labeled, and 
shipped according to laboratory requirements.   
All clinical laboratory tests will be performed by the central laboratory specified in Form 
FDA 1572 Section 4 unless otherwise specified .  The central laboratory reference ranges will 
be used.  Eligib ility at screening will be based on central laboratory assessments.   
A local clinical laboratory may be used to evaluate serum chemistry and hematology within 
3 days before a scheduled visit.  The results of these local laboratory assessments will be used for dosing decisions.   
For all patients, a  local clinical laboratory may be used to assess samples at unscheduled 
visits or for urgent care to evaluate an adverse event.  Such laboratory data will not be 
entered into the study database and local laboratories will not be included on Form 
FDA 1572.  Central laboratory samples should be obtained whenever possible during unscheduled visits.

8.5 Physical Examinations, Vital Signs, and ECGs  
The investigator will perform physical examinations according to the schedules of activities 
(Appendix 1 , Appendix 2) .  Interval medical history will be reviewed as a part of physical 
examin ations.   
Physical examinations  will include an assessment of systems (eg,  general appearance, head, 
eyes, ears, nose, mouth, skin, heart, lungs, lymph nodes, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, neurologic, and skeletal) per standard of care at the study site  or as clinically indicated by 
symptoms.   
Vital sign measurements  will include blood pressure (after supine for 5  minutes), heart rate , 
respiratory rate, and temperature at the visits noted in the schedule of activities .  Blood 
pressure (after supine for 5  minutes) will be measured 15  to 20  minutes before each PK time 
point.  Weight will be  measured at the time of the  examination.  Height will be measured 
only at screening.   
12-Lead ECGs  will be obtained continuous ly at ba seline (day  -1) and days 1, 2, and 22, and 
a single ECG will be obtained at screening and safety follow-up.  ECGs will be collected for analysis at specified time points; p atients must be supine for 10 minutes before these time 
points.  Additional ECGs may  be obtained as necessary per  standard  of care .  For patients 
who enroll and initiate continued talazoparib treatment in the open-label extension study within 30 days, an ECG will be obtained at the time of enrollment in the open-label study.

ENDPOINTS  
9.1 Assessment  of Safety  
The a ssessment of safety will include adverse events, physical examinations , vital signs , 
ECGs,  and clinical laboratory tests.  The procedures for the investigator assessment of 
adverse events are presented in  detail in  Section  8.  The procedures for clinical laboratory 
safety tests are p resented in Section  8.4, and for physical examinations, vital signs, and ECGs  
in Section  8.5.   
9.2 Assessment  of QTc  
ECG recordings from continuous 12-lead ECG recordings will be obtained using Holter monitor s on days  -1, 1, 2, and 22, and will be submitted for independent central review.  
After reviewing for data quality, triplicate 10 -second ECGs will be extrac ted from a  5-minute 
extraction window at each planned time point and will be analyzed for measurement of RR, PR, QRS, and QT intervals and evaluation of ECG morphology.  A cardiologist will verify the interval durations an d perform the morphology analyses.  Heart rate will be used to assess 
QTc endpoints.

10 STATISTICAL METHODS AND SAMPLE SIZE DETERMINATION  
10.1 Statistical and Analytical Plans  
The statistical methods and analyses for this study wil l be described in detail in the statistical 
analysis plan.   
10.2 Analysis Populations  
All safety analyses will be performed using the safety population, defined as all patients who 
receive any amount of talazoparib.   

Medivation, Inc.  Talazoparib  Protocol MDV3800- 14/TRIO029 
19 AUG 2016  – v2.0 FINAL   Page 44 of 58 
The ECG analysis population is defined as all enrolled patients who receive at least 1  dose of 
study drug, and have at least 1 available baseline and 1  on-treatment ECG.   Patients who do 
not complete day 22 or who miss > 5 consecutive doses of study drug will be excluded from 
the analysis of the effects of talazoparib on cardiac repolarization .   
The PK population is defined as all patients  who receive at least 1  dose of talazoparib and 
provide at least 1 reportable concentration.  The PK analysis population is defined as all patients  who have sufficient concentration data to derive at least 1  PK parameter.  Additional 
patients  may be excluded from the PK population at the discretion of the pharmacokineticist.   
The PK-PD analysis population is defined as all patients  in the EC G analysis population who 
have at least 1  time -matched pair of plasma concentration and ECG measurements obtained 
at the same nominal time point.  Additional details on the PK -PD analysis population are 
provided in the statistical analysis plan .   
10.3 Safety Analyses 
All safety analyses will be performed using the safety population, as defined in Section  10.2.  
Drug exposure will be summarized using descriptive statistics.   
The safety of talazoparib will be evaluated by the analysis of incidence of serious and 
nonserious adverse events, severity of adverse events, incidence of dose modifications and of permanent treatment discontinuation due to adverse events, and incidence of new clinically significant changes in vital signs , ECGs , and clinical laboratory values .  Treatment -emergent 
safety data w ill be collected from the first dose of study drug treatment through 30 days after 
the last dose (ie, permanent discontinuation), before initiation of a new antineoplastic therapy, or enrollment in the open -label extension study, whichever occurs first.   
Adverse events will be coded to preferred term and system organ class using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) and classified by severity using the CTCAE version  4.  The number and percentage of patients with adverse events will be p resented by 
MedDRA system organ class and preferred term, relationship to study treatment, severity, seriousness, and outcome (eg,  leading to permanent treatment discontinuation).   
Laboratory values will be classified for severity using the CTCAE  version  4.  Laboratory 
shift tables of baseline results versus postbaseline results to each subsequent visit will be produced as appropriate.    
10.4 ECG Analyses  
All ECG analyses will be conducted using the ECG analysis population.  The primary  
endpoints of the study are to evaluate the effects of talazoparib on the QTcF, and to evaluate 
the relationship between the plasma concentration of talazoparib and the change from baseline in QTc, corrected for heart rate based on the QTcF correction formula (∆QTcF) .  
The time -matched change from baseline in QTc, corrected for heart rate based on Bazett’s 
correction formula (∆QTcB) , will also be evaluated .  Changes from time- matched baseline 
measurements will be calculated and data will be summarized in tabular and graphic formats 

Medivation, Inc.  Talazoparib  Protocol MDV3800- 14/TRIO029 
19 AUG 2016  – v2.0 FINAL   Page 45 of 58 
for each study visit.  Assessments include absolute QTc prolongation with QTc > 450 msec, 
> 480 msec, and > 500 msec and change from baseline in QTc with QTc increase > 30  msec 
and > 60 msec.  The means of each measurement of RR, PR, QRS, and QT interval s will be 
utilized for statistical analyses.   
ECG morphology and changes from baseline for each planned postbaseline time point will be summarized for all patients.  The proportion of patients with any postbaseline change in ECG morphology and the proport ion of patients with each type of abnormality will also be 
summarized.   
10.5 PK Analyses  
Summary data of plasma talazoparib concentrations will be presented in tabular and graphic 
formats for each time point.  PK parameters such as T
max, Cmax, and AUC on days 1 and  22 
will be calculated.   
In addition, the PK data from this study will be combined with PK data from other studies to define a population PK model, which will be reported separately.   
10.6 PK-PD Analyses  
The correlation between changes in ECG interval measurements from time -matched baseline 
and the plasma talazoparib concentration will be investigated using a linear mixed- effects 
model.   
This analysis will be conducted using the PK-PD analysis population.   
10.7 Efficacy Analyses 
No efficacy analysis is planned in this study .   
10.8 Determination of Sample Size  
A sample size of at least 30 evaluable patients will provide 80% power to reject the null 
hypothesis if the mean change from baseline in QTcF is ≥  10 msec wi th a 95% one-sided 
alpha, assuming a standard deviation of 20 msec.  Patients will be enrolled until 30  patients 
complete day  22, miss ≤  5 consecutive doses of study drug, have technically adequate ECG 
recordings, and have at least 80% of specified PK samples collected representing all 3  days 
of observation (days 1, 2, and 22).

13.2 Data Quality Assurance 
13.2.1 Data Management 
Clinical d ata management will be performed by the sponsor or designee according to 
procedures described in a comprehensive data management plan.  The data management plan 
will include procedures for processing the data from this study , and will describe the 
responsibilities of the sponsor and designee when  clinical data management is provided by an 
external  vendor.  In particular, the data management plan will include a list of the standard 
operating procedures that apply to this study.   
Adverse events and medications will be coded using MedDRA and the World Health 
Organization Drug Dictionary (WHO- DD), respectively.  The dictionary versions will be 
named in the data management plan.    
13.2.2 Case Report Forms  
The study will use  an electronic data capture system.  All electronic case report forms will be 
designed and provided electronically to the site by the sponsor or designee and electronic data capture system vendor.  All case report form books are to be filled out completely , 
reviewed , and signed by the investigator or subinvestigators listed on the Form FDA 1572 or 
other appropriate local health authority documents.   
13.2.3 Study Monitoring  
The sponsor or designee will monitor this study in accordance with current GCP guidelines.  
By signing this protocol, the investigator grants permission to the sponsor or designee and 
appropriate regulatory authorities to conduct onsite monitoring of all appropriate study documentation.  T o ensure the accuracy of data collected on the case repor t forms, it is 
mandatory that sponsor representatives (eg, study monitor)  have direct access to original 
source documents ( eg, paper or electronic patient records, patient charts, and laboratory 
reports) needed to verify the entries on case report forms.  During the review of these documents, the anonymity of the patient will be respected with strict adherence to professional standards of confidentiality.   
A study monitor will contact and visit the site regularly and will be allowed, on request at 
a mutually acceptable time, to inspect the various original medical records (paper or electronic) related to  the study.  The study monitor will be responsible for inspecting the case 
report forms at regular intervals throughout the study, to verify the adherence to the protocol and the completeness and correctness of all case report form entries.  The investigator agrees to cooperate with the study monitor to ensure that any problems detected in the course of these monitoring visits are resolved.

19 AUG 2016  – v2.0 FINAL   Page 49 of 58 
13.2.4 Study Audits  
During the course of the study and after study completion, it is likely that one or more quality 
assurance audits will be undertaken by authorized sponsor representatives.  The purpose of the audit is to ensure that the study is (or was)  conducted and monitored in compliance with 
the protocol as well as recognized GCP guidelines and regulations.  These audits will also increase the likelihood that the study data and all other study documentation can withstand a regulatory authority inspection.  If such audits are to occur, they will be arranged for a reasonable and agreed upon time.  By signing this protocol, the investigator grants permission to the sponsor or designee to conduct onsite audits of all appropriate facilities and study documentation.   
13.3 Investigational Product Accountability  
The investigator must maintain accurate records of all study drug supplies received.  All 
records must be made available to the sponsor, authorized representatives, and appropriate 
regulatory agencies, upon request.   
Current ICH GCP guidelines require the investigator to ensure that study drug deliveries 
from the sponsor are received by a responsible person (eg, pharmacist), and the following: 
• That such deliveries are recorded , for example, on the sponsor’s drug accountability 
log or other sponsor-approved pharmacy log 
• That study drug is handled and stored safely and properly in accordance with the label and the study protocol 
• That study drug is only administered  or dispensed to study patients in accordance 
with the protocol 
• That any used or unused drug is returned by the patient at each required visit 
• That any unused study drug is returned to the sponsor- designated facility  or standard 
procedures for the alternative disposition of unused study drug are followed and only after approval by the sponsor representative 
Drug inventory and accountability records for the study drugs will be kept by the investigator/pharmacist.  Study drug accountability throughout the study must be documented.  The following guidelines are therefore pertinent:  
• The investigator agrees not to supply study drug to any persons except the patients in this study.   
• The investigator/pharmacist will keep the study drugs in a pharmacy or other locked and secure storage facility under controlled storage conditions as required by the study drug label, accessible only to those authorized by the investigat or to dispense 
these study drugs.   
• The investigator/pharmacist will maintain a  study drug inventory.  The inventory will 
include details of materia l received and a clear record of when they were dispensed 
and to which patient.   

Medivation, Inc.  Talazoparib  Protocol MDV3800- 14/TRIO029 
19 AUG 2016  – v2.0 FINAL   Page 50 of 58 
• The investigator/pharmacist agrees to conduct a final drug supply inventory and to 
record the results of this inventory on the drug accountability record at the conclusion or termination of this study.  It must be possible to reconcile delivery records with those of used and returned study drug.  Any discrepancies must be accounted for.  Appropriate forms of deliveries and returns must be signed by the person responsible.   
• Used or unused study drug may be destroyed at the study site according to standard 
institutional procedures if the sponsor agrees with the procedure, and after drug accountability has been conducted by the sponsor or representative, unless otherwise approved.  A  copy of the standard institutional procedure for destroying 
investigational drugs will be provided to the sponsor or designee upon request for review and approval before the first onsite destruction.  Unused study drug not destroyed at the site must b e returned to the sponsor-designated facility at the end of 
the study or upon expiration.   
13.4 Compensation, Insurance, and Indemnity  
In the event of a side effect or injury, appropriate medical care as determined by the investigator or designated alternate w ill be provided.   
If bodily injury is sustained, resulting directly from the use of the study drug or by required study procedures, the sponsor  will reimburse for reasonable physician fees and medical 
expenses necessary for treatment of only the bodily injury that is not covered by the patient’s 
medical or hospital insurance, provided that the injury is not due to a negligent or wrongful act or omission by the study doctor and study staff.  No other compensation of any type will be provided by the sponsor.  Financial compensation for lost wages, disability, or discomfort 
due to the study participation or procedures is not available.   
13.5 Retention of Records  
The investigator must make original study data (paper or electronic) accessible to the study 
monitor, other authorized sponsor representatives, and regulatory a gency  inspectors 
(eg, US  FDA) upon request.  A file for each patient must be maintained that includes the 
signed informed consent form and copies of all source documentation related to that patient.  
The investigator must ensure the reliability and availability of source documents from which the information on the case report form was derived.   
Patient identity information recorded will be maintained for at least 15 years on the patient 
confidentia lity log  or longer if required by local regulations.   
Investigators must maintain all study documentation for at least 2 years following the 
approval of the drug, or until 2  years after the investigational drug program is discontinued , 
or longer if required by local regulations.  Study documentation includes all essential documents as defined in ICH E6 Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice.  The sponsor or designee will notify the investigator when any records may be discarded, but investigators 
must compl y with local regulations .

13.6 Study Termination  
The sponsor will terminate this study following completion of the study objectives, or earlier 
if deemed necessary.   
The sponsor reserves the right to terminate the study anytime.  When the sponsor is aware of 
information on matters concerning the quality, efficacy, and safety of the study drug, as well as other important information that may affect proper conduct of the clinical study, the sponsor may terminate the study and send a written notice of the termination along with the reasons to the investigator.   
If an investigator or the investigator’s EC  intends to terminate participation in the study, the 
investigator must immediately inform the sponsor and provide the reason for it.   
14 USE OF STUDY INFORMATION AND PUBLICATION  
The results of this study will be published or presented at scientific meetings in a  timely, 
objective, and clinically meaningful manner that is consistent with good science, industry and 
regulator guidance, and the need to protect the intellectual property of Medivation (sponsor), regardless of the outcome of the trial.  The data generated in this clinical trial are the exclusive property of the sponsor and are confidential.  Written approval from the sponsor is required before disclosing any information related to this clinical trial, and no publications initiated by investigators may be published until all protocol-defined primary and secondary endpoints are published in a manuscript.  Every attempt will be made to minimize the 
interval be tween the completion of data analysis and publication of the study results.  
Recommendations for  the timing of presentation of trial endpoint data and the publication 
venues (congresses/journals) will be given by the sponsor’s Publications Steering Committee.   
Each investigator agrees to submit all manuscripts or congress abstracts and 
posters/presentations to the sponsor prior to submission.  This allows the sponsor to protect proprietary information, provide comments based on information from other studi es that may 
not yet be available to the investigator, and ensure scientific and clinical accuracy.  The details of the processes of producing and reviewing reports, manuscripts, and presentations based on the data from this trial will be presented in the investigator’s clinical study 
agreement.   
In accord with standard editorial and ethical practice, the sponsor will generally support 
publication of multicenter trials only in their entirety and not as individual center data.  In this case, a coordinating investigator and lead author will be designated by mutual 
agreement.   
Any formal publication of the study in which input of sponsor personnel exceeded that of 
conventional monitoring will be considered as a joint publication by the investigator and the appropriate sponsor personnel.  Authorship will be determined by mutual agreement and all 
authors must meet the criteria for authorship established by the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) Uniform Requirements for Manuscripts or stric ter local 

Medivation, Inc.  Talazoparib  Protocol MDV3800- 14/TRIO029 
19 AUG 2016  – v2.0 FINAL   Page 52 of 58 
criteria  (ICMJE,  2015).  The sponsor does not compensate for authorship of a publication and 
all authors will be required to disclose, as part of the publication submission, any potential 
conflicts of interest, including pertinent financial or personal relationships with the sponsor or related en tities, including sponsors of competing products that might be perceived to be 
a source of bias.   Authorship is decided on an individual basis and the sponsor’s Publications 
Steering Committee and sponsor representatives will mutually determine authors and  their 
sequence on individual publications based on the relative contribution of each author to the study and/or publication.   
Investigators in this study agree to have their name listed as an investigator in any 
publication reporting results from this study, whether or not they are an author on the publication.   
Professional medical writing support is permissible, and any writing support will be acknowledged in each applicable publication, explaining the role the professional writer had in the drafting of the publication.  Medical writing and publications support funded by the sponsor on behalf of investigator authors will be considered as a transfer of value under the reporting requirements of Section  6002 of the Patient Protection Affordable Care Act 
(PPACA,  2010).  Transfer of value will be allocated to authors following sponsor guidelines.

[1] Anytime necessary to assess or follow up adverse events, at the patient’s request, or per investigator decision.   
[2] Safety follow -up occurs approximately 30 days after the last dose of study drug or before initiation of a new antineoplastic therapy, whichever occurs 
first.  Phone patients for adverse event follow -up if they do not come to the clinic.  F or patients who enroll and initiate continued talazoparib  treatment 
in a separate open -label extension study within 30  days after the last dose of talazoparib , safety follow -up will be omitted ; an ECG will be obtained  at 
the time of enrollment i n the open -label extension study .   
[3] On day - 1 (time 0, corresponding to the dosing time on day  1), apply Holter monitor and record ECGs for 6  hours.  On day 1 (within 72  hours of 
time 0 on day - 1, corresponding to the clock  time of the first baseline ECG measurement ), start recording ECGs at least 45  minutes before time  0, 
administer the first dose of study drug at time  0, and continue recording ECGs for 6  hours postdose.  On day  2 (24  hours after the first dose of study 
drug), start record ing ECGs at least  30 minute s before day  2 dose.  On day  22, start recording ECGs at least 45  minutes before time  0, administer study 
drug at time  0, and continue recording ECGs for 6  hours postdose .  (Appendix  3)   
[4] Obtain a single 12- lead ECG  (after supine for 10  minutes); obtain at the time of enrollment in the open -label extension study for patients who enroll in 
that study within 30  days.

[5] Measure blood pressure (after supine for 5  minutes), heart rate, respiratory rate, and temperature  at each visit .  On days  -1, 1, 2, and  22, m easure blood 
pressure (after supine for 5  minutes) 15 to 20 minutes before each PK time point  (Appendix  3).   
[6] Assess systems (eg,  general appearance, head, eyes, ears, nose, mouth, skin, heart, lung, lymph nodes, gastrointestinal,  genitourinary , neurologic, and 
skeletal) per st andard of care at the study site or as clinically indicated by symptoms.  Measure weight.  May be skipped on day  -1 if performed within 
prior 7  days.   
[7] Collect serious adverse event information from the time of signed informed consent through approxim ately 30 days after the last dose of study drug, 
before a new antineoplastic therapy, or enrollment in the open- label extension study, whichever occurs first.  Collect nonserious adverse event 
information from day  1 through approximately 30  days after the last dose of study drug, before initiation of a new antineoplastic therapy, or 
enrollment in the open -label extension study, whichever occurs first.   
[8] Administer talazoparib at the study site on days  1, 2, and  22; administer talazoparib on days  2 and 22 at the same clock time as time  0 (±1  hour) on 
day 1.  Instruct patient to self -administer talazoparib at approximately the same time each morning on day  3 through day 21.   
Patients will fast for at least 6 hours before  and 2  hours after the dose on  days 1 and 22.  Patients may resume eating after the  2-hour postdose PK 
sample is collected .  On other days, talazoparib may be taken with food or without food.   
[9] Refer to the central laboratory instruction manual for sample processing and for estima ted turnaround time for laboratory results.   
[10] Collect blood samples for PK on day  1 immediately before the first dose of study drug and at 1, 2, 4, and 6 hours postdose; on day  2 at 24  hours after 
the first dose of study drug  (and before day  2 dose) ; and on day 22 predose and  at 1, 2, 4, and 6 hours postdose .  After obtaining vital signs, patient 
should remain supine for 10 -15 minutes before collecting blood sample for PK  (Appendix  3).   
[11] For women of childbearing potential only.  Perform urine or serum pregnancy test either locally or  using a centrally provided kit with a minimum 
sensitivity of 25  IU/L or equivalent  units human chorionic gonadotropin .  Discon tinue study drug treatment if a  pregnancy test is positive.

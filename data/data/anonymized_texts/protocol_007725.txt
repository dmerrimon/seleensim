Project Summary  
 Background:  Intra-jejunal administration of bile acids improves insulin sensitivity.  
 
Hypothesis: The ox bile extract  in delayed (ileocolonic) -release formulation, stimulates enteroendocrine L cell 
secretion in the i leum and colon, increasing the secretion of FGF- 19, GLP -1, oxyntomodulin (OXM), and PYY
3-
36, improv ing insulin sensitivity and induc ing weight loss.  
 
Aim:  To study the effect of an ileocolonic formulation of  ox bile extract  on insulin sensitivity , postprandial 
plasma glycemia and incretin levels, gastric emptying and body weight  in overweight or obese type 2 diabetic 
subjects on therapy with metformin and/or DPP -IV inhibitors .  
 Study design : This is  a single  center, placebo -controlled, parallel group, single dose randomized controlled 
trial to 28 days  (+/- 4 days ) study the effect of delayed (ileocolonic) -release ox bile extract  500 mg BID on 
insulin sensitivity, gastric emptying of liquids and solids (measured by scintigraphy)  and weight loss in 
overweight or obese type 2 diabetic subjects .  Participants will be  receiving therapy with DPP4 inhibitors (e.g. 
sitagliptin) alone or in combination with metformin . Blood samples will be collected at defined times to measure 
glycemia , FGF -19 and incretin s (GLP -1, OXM, PYY
3-36) fasting levels and responses to the meal.   
 Anticipated Results: In comparison with placebo, ox bile extract  will increase insulin sensitivity, enhance 
glycemic control, increase postprandial incretins, and delay GE of liquids.  
 Significance : This study will prove that ileocolonic -release ox bile extract  enhances glycemic control in T2DM 
patients.

 Background and Significance  
Obesity and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) are chronic illnesses whose prevalence have reached 
epidemic proportions in developed countries and are increasing in developing countries.1 In the USA, the 
prevalence of overweight adults is 64%, and obese adults is 30.5%.2 This alarming obesity epidemic poses a 
heavy burden to the U.S. economy, costing more than $150 billion every year —10 percent o f the total health 
budget —according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC 2012).  Patients with obesity are at 
a higher risk of a new -onset cardiovascular event and type 2 diabetes.3 Nearly 24 million Americans suffer 
from diabetes and its associated co -morbidities. Diabetes is now the fifth leading cause of death in the US.4 
These alarming statisti cs reinforce the urgent  need for research into the prevention of diabetes, and the 
prevention of the progression or complications  of diabetes.   Currently, the most effective treatment for obesity, 
metabolic syndrome and T2DM is bariatric or metabolic surgery.5                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
The efficacy in obesity and T2DM of metabolic surgery when compared to caloric restriction suggests that 
the mechanism on weight loss  and reversal of insulin resistance and hyperglycemia exceeds the effect of diet 
restriction and gastrointestinal anatomical re -arrangement as in duodenal switch or Roux -en Y gastric bypass.   
Recent advances on the understanding of metabolic surgery, suggest that bile acids play a role in the 
surgery -related improvement of diabetes. Metabolic surgery results in doubl ing of  the concentration of serum 
bile acids, and increases serum adiponectin and GLP -1. Effects of b ile acids in the distal small intestine results 
in weight loss and improved glucose homeostasis by  stimulating  enteroendocrine L cell secretion, and 
increasing FGF19, thyroid hormone - type 2 Deiodinase ( D2) and decreasing endoplasmic reticulum ( ER) 
stress.6-9 These result in rapid increase in incretins, increased energy expenditure, decreased appetite, 
decreased hepatic insulin resistance and improved muscle insulin sensitivity.10, 11  
Metabolic surgery; is invasive, has multiple side effects including perioperative complications and long term 
nutritional deficits .12 Thus, metabolic surgery cannot be considered a public health remedy to the current 
obesity and T2DM epidemic , and a low cost, non- invasive approach  that is efficacious over a long term  is 
needed to fight this epidemic. Our overriding approach is to adopt a weight loss mechanism produced by 
bariatric surgery in a non -surgical remedy  for treatment of obesity and T2DM.  Specifically, our study will 
address the concept that  changes in bile acid concentration in the ileum  seen after metabolic surgery could be 
applied by non- invasive pharmacological treatment in  obesity and T2DM.  
Prior studies using taurocholic acid (TCA ), a hydrophilic bile acid, have shown an improvement  in 
endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress,13 reversal of insulin resistance and restoration of  glucose homeostasis in 
mice with T2DM .14  Subsequently, these results were confirmed in obese men and women showing that TCA  
1,750 mg/day improves liver  and muscle insulin sensitivity.11 These results were not as dramatic as those seen 
after metabolic surgery. Hence, a subsequent  study mimicking the role of intra -luminal bile acids after 
metabolic surgery was conducted by intrajejunal infusion of taurocholic acid (2 g); this resulted in acute 
improvement in glucose homeostasis and increased GLP -1 concentration.10 Recently, we shown that Na -
chenodeoxycholate delayed- released in the ileum and colon produces mild delay i n gastric, accelerated 
colonic transit15 and weight loss (preliminary data – unpublished).  
The overall research goal is to study the effect of delayed- release ox bile extract  on glycemic co ntrol in 
obesity and T2DM. The current proposal is a proof of concept, single center, placebo- controlled, parallel group, 
randomized control trial in patients with obesity and T2DM receiving DPP4 inhibitors (e.g. sitagliptin) alone or 
in combination with metformin , as standard of care.  
 
A. Specific Aims:  
We hypothesize that the ox bile extract  in delayed (ileocolonic) -release formulation, stimulates 
enteroendocrine L cell secretion in the i leum and colon, increasing the secretion of FGF- 19, GLP -1, 
oxyntomodul in (OXM), and PYY 3-36, and improves insulin sensitivity and induces weight loss.  
To study the effect of an ileocolonic formulation of ox bile extract  on insulin sensitivity , postprandial 
glycemia and incretin levels, gastric emptying, body weight  and fast ing serum FGF- 19 levels  in overweight or 
obese type 2 diabetic subjects on therapy with DPP4 inhibitors (e.g. sitagliptin) alone or in combination with 
metformin.

Figure 1  
Figure 2  C. Preliminary data:  
C.1. Obesity and T2DM research:  Our research 
group at the Mayo Clini c has more than 30 years of 
experience in proof of concept randomized trials  
and over 300 original articles in gastrointestinal 
physiology and pharmacology; the lab has been 
funded by the NIH for the past 9 years to conduct research in obesity (DK67071).     
C.2. S odium chenodeoxycholate delayed 
release:  We have previously demonstrated that 
sodium chenodeoxycholate delayed (ileocolonic) -
release 1000 mg PO daily is a well- tolerated 
medication with minimal side effects
15, 16. NaCDC 
(ileocolonic) -release 1000 mg PO daily for four 
days produces weight loss in healthy subjects, 
unpublished data (figure 1) and delays gastric 
emptying (figure 2) in healthy subjects (HS) and subjects with constipation predominant Irritable 
Bowel Syndrome (IBS -C) 
15, 16. Body weight change 
and gastric emptying were not end points of those studies and were incidental findings. The weight 
loss and gastric emptying after ONLY four days of 
treatment suggests that ileocolonic -release Na-
CDC m ay be a promising method to induce  weight 
loss in the appropriate population. Na -CDC is not 
available for long term clinical studies. Thus we proposed to use the FDA approved ox bile extract 
as a substitute.  
 
D. Research strategy  
D.1. Rationale:  Bile acid secretion increases significant ly after Roux -in-Y gastric bypass and bile acids appear 
to have a major role in the mechanism of weight loss after metabolic surgery.  Recent studies showed that 
intrajejunal -delivery of primary bile acids improve insulin sensi tivity . We hypothesize  that the ox bile extract  
delivered through delayed (ileocolonic) -release therapy stimulates enteroendocrine L cell secretion i n the distal 
jejunum, ileum and colon, thereby increasing the secretion of FGF-19, GLP-1, OXM, and PYY3- 36. These 
observations suggest that bile acids may decrease blood glucose and improve insulin sensitivity through their 
effects on endogenous incretins,  independently of gastric emptying and  glucose.  
D.2. Design:  We propose a single center, placebo- controll ed, parallel group, single dose randomized 
controlled 28  +/- 4 day  trial to study  the effect of delayed (ileocolonic) -release ox bile extract  500 mg bid on 
postprandial glycemia, insulin sensitivity, fasting and postprandial incretins (FGF-19, GLP -1, OXM, PYY 3-36), 
gastric emptying and weight loss in overweight or obese type 2 diabetic subjects receiving thera py with DPP4 
inhibitors (e.g. sitagliptin) alone or in combination with metformin . 
D.3. Participants:  Subjects with  obesity and  T2DM on therapy with D PP4 inhibitors (e.g. sitagliptin) alone or in 
combination with metformin  (standard of care) will be recruited by direct contact from an established database 
of patients with T2DM and BMI > 30 kg/m2 or by public advertisement.  Eligible cases will be invited to 
participate by letter using the randomization scheme provided by the study bio- statistician. All subjects will be 
given a verbal explanation of the study, provided time to read and study the written consent form and its information, given opportunities  to ask questions and a copy of the consent form.  Participants will be informed 
of their right to withdraw from the study at any time without prejudice to their clinical management now or in the 
future. Consent will be sought by one of the medical doctor investigators or study coordinator, and consent will 
be documented by the participant’s signature on the consent form. All recruitment or contact information will be 
approved by Mayo's Institutional Review Board.

E. Materials and Methods  
- 4 - 
 E.1. D elayed (ileocolonic) -release  Ox Bile .  After acquiring  ox bile extract 500  mg tablets from Satiogen, 
tablets and  matched  placebo controls will be encapsulated in enteric coating formulated   by Avomeen 
Analytical  Services, Ann Arbor MI  Subjects will take medication or matched placebo orally twice daily on an 
empty stomach, 30 minutes prior to breakfast and evening dinner for 28 +/- 4 days.  
E.2. Mixed Oral Glucose Tolerance Test and meal (mixed meal)  gastric emptying test : The mixed meal 
will be done at baseline and on day 28 ( +/- 4 days)  after a 10 to 12 hours fasting.  Subjects will report to the 
Mayo Clinic CRT U Charlton 7 at the scheduled appointment time.  After arrival to the CRTU, an 18 g cannula 
will be inserted retrogradely into a peripheral arm or hand vein.   At baseline testing, participants will receive a 
63g glucose in 240 ml of skim milk and a meal with 2 scrambled eggs, 50g of Canadian Bacon and one slice of 
bread (~560 Kcal: 43% carbohydrate, 18% protein, and 40% fat). To enable measurement of the solid and 
liquid phase of gastric emptying, the milk  will be labeled with 0.5 mCi of 99mTc DTPA  and the egg will be 
labeled with 0.05 mCi of In111Chloride labeled activated charcoal  to allow for measurement of gastric emptying 
and orocecal transit  22,23,24.  Scans will be acquired at the completion of the meal and every 15 minutes for the 
first 2 hours and then at 150, 180, 210, 240, and 360 minutes following the meal.  In addition, following the 
mixed meal , blood samples will be collected at -30,-15, 0, 10, 20, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120, 180, 240, 300, and 360 
min for measurement of plasma glucose, insulin and C -peptide concentration. The results from the mixed meal 
will be used to calculate the area above basal (AAB) for glucose, and the oral minimal model to calculate the 
Insulin Sensitivity  (IS) 18. Other methods for calculating the IS will be considered 19 20.  At the conclusion of 
testing, the cannula will be removed and the subject will be dismissed from the CRTU.  
 
On Day 28 (+/ - 4 days), subjects will repeat gastric emptying and mixed meal testing as described above but 
will receive the study medication/placebo 30 minutes prior to the test meal.  
E.3. Blood samples: The fasting blood samples will be collected during the mixed meal and stored - 70° C 
freezer . We will analyze plasma glucose, insulin, C- peptide, GLP -1, PYY3 -36, OXM, FGF -19, DPP -4, 7-α-C4, 
Adiponectin, Leptin, CCK, PP.  
 
                                                                          
 
  
 
 
 
 
F. Statistical Analysis    
The primary analyses will compare treatment groups at the post –4-week treatment visit using analysis of 
covariance (ANCOVA) models incorporating the corresponding baseline study val ue as a covariate (e.g., 
fasting or peak concentration, or AAB).  
F.1.Sample size assessment  - The table below summarizes data for primary response measures and uses 
the (relative variation, CV%) to estimate the effect size detectable with 80% power based on a two sample t-
test at a two- sided α level of 0.05. The effect size is the difference in group means as a percentage of the 
listed mean for each response and assumes 12 subjects per group; these effect sizes are clinically significant. 
The ANCOVA analysis will likely provide similar power for somewhat smaller differences by incorporating 
relevant covariates. The data for AUC for glucose and insulin have been published25. Groups will be balance 
based on the use of gliptins and/or metformin.

 bias; b) Potential for type II error  - The sample sizes have been based on appropriate statistical power for 
OGTT, glucose and insulin AUC endpoints for which the coefficient of variation has been thoroughly 
characterized in the prior literature from our lab; and c) Feasibility  - We have already identified a cohort of 
people in our community who are type 2 Diabetics and willing to part icipate. We have the experience to 
successfully recruit 50 type 2 diabetics for the three days of testing in the CR TU.   
G.2.Human Studies Aspects  
G.2.a. Adverse Effects of Medications : Ox bile extract  is used for gallbladder stones dissolution and 
prevention as a nutraceutical and food supplement . It is associated with the following potential adverse effects: 
nausea, diarrhea, anorexia, hypersensitivity.  These are included in the consent form.  
G.2.b. Radiation exposure: in this study comes from the 99mTc and 111In used to measure gut transit. 
These exposures conform to previously approved levels of radiation exposure approved by the Radiation Control Committee at Mayo Clinic. The radiation dosimetry and organ exposures (in mrad) are minimal.  
See appendix  B: Dosimetry Table  
 G.2.c Patient risks: If the fasting g lucose is greater than 250 mg/dl on either testing day, subject will 
be managed following standard of care in clinical setting. The recommended insulin doses will be per “Insulin 
sliding scale with Insulin regular: Glucose 250- 259 = 3 units; 260- 299 = 4 units; 300 -339 = 5 units; 340- 379 = 6 
units; 380 -399 = 7 units; >400 = call physician.  Likely this subject will be excluded from the analysis.  
 
 
H. Anticipated Results and Significance   
We expect to  demonstrate that delayed (ileocolonic) -release ox bile extract  increases insulin sensitivity or 
reduces insulin resistance, improving glycemic control. This study will provide the basis for future pharmacological studies, exploring the effect of ox bile e xtract delayed (ileocolonic) -release on type 2 DM and 
obesity in a placebo- controlled 12 week randomized controlled trial.

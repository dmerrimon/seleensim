Exploratory objectives  
• To investigate the effects of variations in genes encoding for CYP enzymes and 
transporters on the potential drug -drug interaction profile of tazemetostat 
• To explore the effect of tazemetostat on overall survival (OS)  
Study design  Phase 1, open -label, 2-part, pharmacokinetic, safety, and activity study  
Methodology  This 2-part study is designed to characterize the drug -drug interaction (DDI) potential of 
tazemetostat.   Upon initiation of tazemetostat treatment, eligible subjects will receive 
tazemetostat BID continuously in 28 -day cycles in both parts of the study.    
Part A.   Subjects enrolled in Part A will receive treatment with oral tazemetostat tablets 
400 mg BID for 24 days beginning on Day 1.   Blood samples for the analysis of plasma 
tazemetostat and its  metabolites concentrations will be collected predose and over 8 hours 
after the morning dose of tazemetostat on Day 15.   Subjects will receive fluconazole 400 
mg once daily for 4 days starting on Day 16.   On Day 19, blood samples for the analysis 
of plasm a tazemetostat, its metabolites, and fluconazole will be collected predose and 
over 8 hours after the morning tazemetostat dose.   Tazemetostat  400 mg BID will 
continue through Day 24.   Subjects will then receive tazemetostat 800 mg BID starting on 
Day 25.  
Part B .  Subjects enrolled in Part B will receive single oral doses of repaglinide 0.25  mg 
and omeprazole 20 mg on Day 1.   Administration of tazemetostat 800 mg BID will begin 
on Day 2.   On Day 16, subjects again will receive single oral doses of repaglini de 0.25 mg 
and omeprazole 20 mg approximately 1 hour after the morning dose of tazemetostat.   
Subjects also will receive omeprazole 20 mg once daily in the morning on Days 16 
through 19.   Blood samples for analysis of plasma repaglinide, repaglinide metabo lites, 
omeprazole, 5 -OH-omeprazole, and omeprazole sulfone will be collected predose and 
over 7 hours after administration on Day 1 and Day 16.   Blood samples for analysis of 
plasma tazemetostat and metabolites will be collected over 8 hours after administ ration of 
the morni ng dose on Day 16 and Day 19.    
Upon initiation of tazemetostat treatment, all subjects enrolled in this study will receive oral tazemetostat  for up to 6 months (24 weeks) until they have an unacceptable toxicity, 
disease progression, or  withdraw consent.   Subjects continuing to receive benefit from 
tazemetostat treatment can be transi tioned to Study EZH -501 (a roll over study ) upon 
completion of Study EZH -105, at the investigator’s discretion, and after completing all 
study assessments and receiving at least 6 months of treatment with tazemetostat.   
Subjects who are enrolled in the study and do not complete all study assessments, or who 
do not transition to Study EZH -501 must have a post -treatment f ollow -up visit within 30 
days  
of the last dose of tazemetostat.   Subjects who permanently discontinue treatment with 
tazemetostat and do not transition to the EZH -501 study, will be followed for OS.  
Number of subjects  Approximately 32 subjects will be enrolled to achieve 12 subjects who complete each part 
of the study (total of 24 completed subjects).   Subjects will complete either Part A or Part 
B.   
Subjects (both parts of study) who require a dose reduction during the first 19 days of 
treatment may be replaced.  Subjects who miss 2 or more consecutive tazemetostat doses 
during the first 19 days of treatment or miss more than 3 tazemetostat doses during the 
first 19 days of treatment may be replaced.   Subjects who miss 2 or more PK blood 
sample collections may be replaced.

CTCAE; Version 4.03) will be used for grading clinical and laboratory AEs.    
The AE reporting period for a subject enrolled in the study begins when the subject 
provides informed consent and continues through 14 days after the last dose of study drug.   
All AEs that occur in enrolled subjects during the AE reporting period must be recorded, 
regardless of the relationship of the AE to study drug.   Any known untoward event that 
occurs beyond the AE reporting period that the investigator assesses as possibly related to 
study drug also should be recorded.  
Pharmacokinetics  Serial blood samples will be collected throughout the study. For PK analysis, 
approximately 24 mL of blood will be obtained in Part A  and 56 mL of blood will be 
obtained in Part B.  
See Section 8.3.6  for specific collection timepoints for each part of the study.  
All PK blood samples may be drawn from either a central venous catheter or a peripherally placed intravenous catheter.  
Plasma concentrations of all analytes will be determined by validated bioanalytical methods.   Plasma concentrations of all analytes will be listed for each subject and 
summarized by study part, treatment, day, and nominal time.   Stand ard summary statistics 
will be calculated (i.e., arithmetic mean, standard deviation  (STD) , median, minimum, 
and maximum) for each endpoint.    
Activity  Antitumor activity will be assessed using the Lugano  Classification  (Cheson 2014, 
Appendix 1) for subjects with lymphoma , or RECIST v1.1 (Appendix  2) for subjects with 
solid tumor s.  Overall response rate (ORR: complete response [CR] or partial response 
[PR]) and disease control rate (DCR: any CR or PR, or stable disease [SD] lasting 24 
weeks or longer from start of treatment with tazemetostat) will be determined.

Exploratory endpoints  
• Genotyping data for genes encoding CYP enzymes and transporters  
• Overall survival (OS)  
 
Statistical methods  Four  populations will be employed in the analyses of the study data:  
• The Intent -to-Treat (ITT) population will consist of all subjects who receive at least 
one dose of tazemetostat.   The ITT population will be used for summaries and 
analyses  of the efficacy en dpoints.  
• The Safety population  will consist of all subjects who receive at least one dose of IP 
who have at least one post  dose safety observation recorded.  The Safety population  
will be used for summaries and analys es of the safety and tolerability.  
• Pharmacokinetic (PK) population  will include all subjects in the Safety population 
who have sufficient post dose samples collected to allow estimation of the PK 
parameters.  The PK population will be used for PK summaries and analyses.  
• The Pharmacogenomic ( PGx) population will include all subjects in the PK 
population from whom PGx results are available.  The PGx population will be used 
for summary of PK parameters by presence or absence of polymorphic genetic 
markers. 
 
Log-transformed PK parameters will be analyzed by an analysis of variance (ANOVA).   
The geometric least squares (adjusted) mean and  associated 90% confidence interval (CI) 
for the test treatment to reference treatment ratio of adjusted geometric means will be provided after transformation of t he results from the log -transformed analysis back to the 
original scale.  
Part A  
Descriptive statistics will be calculated for plasma concentrations and PK parameters of 
tazemetostat and its metabolites and fluconazole.   To evaluate the effect of fluconazol e on 
the PK of tazemetostat, the ratio of adjusted geometric means and 90% CI for the test 
treatment (tazemetostat administered in combination with fluconazole) to the reference treatment (tazemetostat alone) for tazemetostat PK parameters will be calculat ed.

 Descriptive statistics will be calculated for plasma concentrations and PK parameters for 
repaglinide and its metabolites, omeprazole, 5 -OH-omeprazole, omeprazole sulfone, and 
tazemetostat and its metabolites.   To evaluate the effect of taze metostat on the PK of 
repaglinide and omeprazole, the ratio of adjusted geometric means and 90% CI for the test 
treatment (repaglinide administered with omeprazole and steady -state tazemetostat) to the 
reference treatment (repaglinide administered with omeprazole) for repaglinide and 
omeprazole PK  parameters will be calculated.   To evaluate the effect of increased gastric 
pH on the PK of tazemetostat, the ratio of adjusted geometric means and 90% CI for the 
test treatment (tazemetostat administered after 4 days of treatment with omeprazole) to the 
reference treatment (tazemetostat administered 1 hour before administration of repaglinide 
and omeprazole) for tazemetostat PK parameters will be calculated.  
Treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAE)  will be summarized . Summaries of TEAEs 
will consist of the number and percentage of subjects reporting the AE by System Organ 
Class ( SOC ) and by preferred term .  TEAEs which occur more than once for a subject will 
be counted only once in the subject frequencies.   TEAEs with different CTCAE grades for 
a subject will be counted at the worst (highest) grade for the same SOC (likewise for preferred term ).  TEAEs with different drug relationship for a subject will be counted at 
strongest relationship for the same SOC (likewise for preferred term .  TEAEs with 
missing relationship to study treatment will be counted as “related”.
  TEAEs with missing 
CTCAE grade will be counted as Grade 3 (“severe”).  
TEAEs, SAEs , related TEAEs, related SAEs, ≥ Grade 3 AEs, TE AEs leading to 
withdrawal or treatment discontinuation , and TEAEs of special interest  will be 
summarized overall and by study part according to SOC and preferred terms.   TEAEs will 
also be summarized in listings.    
Shifts from baseline in low, normal, and high classificat ion and clinically significant 
findings for each parameter will be summarized by study part  and overall at each planned 
post-baseline visit.  
Physical examination, vital signs, ECG , and  ECOG performance status will be 
summarized by study part and overall.   
Response will be based on Lugano Classification ( Cheson 2014 ) for subjects with 
lymphoma,  or RECIST v1.1  for subjects with solid tumors.  ORR (CR or PR) will be 
summarized along with an exact 90% CI. DCR (CR  or PR, or SD lasting 24 weeks or 
longer since start of treatment) will be summarized similarly.  
OS will be calculated using the Kaplan -Meier method. If there are a sufficient number of 
deaths at the time of the analysis, median OS, first and third quartiles,  and 90% CI 
(Brookmeyer -Crowley method) will be summarized.

 2. BACKGROUND AND RATIO NALE  
This document is a protocol for a human research study. This study is to be conducted according 
to United States (US) and international standards of Good Clinical Practice (GCP; Food and Drug Administration [FDA] Title 21 Part 312 and International Conference on Harmonization [ICH] guidelines), applicable government regulations, and i nstitutional research policies and 
procedures.  
2.1. Background 
Post-translational modifications of histones, the core proteins of chromatin, play an important 
role in controlling the fidelity of cellular gene transcription patterns.   One of the critical 
transcription -controlling histone modifications is methylation of specific lysine and arginine 
residues, catalyzed by histone methyl transferases (HMTs) which all use S -adenosyl methionine 
(SAM) as a c o-factor for the methylation reaction [ Copeland, 2013 ].  Genetic alterations in a 
number of HMTs or associated regulatory proteins have been identified in several human cancers 
where they are purported to be oncogenic.  Enhancer of Zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) is the catalytic subunit of the multi-protein polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) that catalyzes the mono -, 
di-, and trimethylation of lysine 27 of histone H3 (H3K27) [ Margueron, 2011].   EZH2 mutation 
and/or over-expression has been observed in several cancer types, leading to an aberrant H3K27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) state which is oncogenic [ Chase, 2011 ].  For instance, somatic gain 
of function mutations within EZH2, found within subsets of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), result in an oncogenic dependency on EZH2 production of abnormally high H3K27me3 levels, and resultant transcriptional reprogramming of the cell. [ Morin 2010] 
2.2. Lymphoma  
Somatic mutation s within the EZH2 gene on 3 hotspots  (Y64 6. A682, and A692 
[NM_001203247] ) are present in follicular lymphoma (FL) and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma 
(DLBCL) and lead to high levels of H3K27 trimethylation (H3K27me3)  in these lymphomas. 
Those mutation s of EZH2 , therefore , have  been proposed to be required for the development and 
maintenance of the mutation -bearing lymphomas. Inhibition of EZH2 leads to reduction in 
H3K27 me3 and cell death in lymphoma cell lines bearing the mutation. In a ddition, loss of 
function of mixed lineage leukemia protein 2 ( MLL2 ) and histone acetyl transferases ( HATs ) 
may generate abnormal methylation states of H3K27, potentially leading to a dependency on EZH2. In nonclinical models, inhibition of EZH2 leads to reduction in H3K27 me3 in all 
lymphoma cell lines irrespective of their EZH2 mutation status. While cells with wild -type

 EZH2 are growth inhibited with EZH2 inhibition in vitro, only mutant bearing cells undergo cell 
death in cultur e [Béguelin 2013; Knutson 2014] .  
Changes to the tumor microenvironment, for instance those affecting antitumor immunity, are increasingly recognized as an important mechanism in lymphomagenesis, affecting all types of NHL [Scott 2014] . Epigenetic therapy has been suggested to release repression of molecules 
important for imm une recognition on tumor cells [ Wrangle 2013 ], and EZH2 inhibition may 
induce similar effects. In addition, loss of EZH2 has been described as affecting T  helper cell 
plasticity [Tumes  2013 ] and is proposed to inhibit the function of regulatory T cells [
Arvey 
2014; DuPage 2015; Yang 2015 ], suggesting that EZH2 inhi bition may contribute to enhancing 
antitumor immunity. 
In summary, the available nonclinical data suggest that EZH2 mutant lymphomas should show 
the highest sensitivity to EZH2 inhibition, but wild -type cases could also be affected through 
tumor cell auton omous mechanisms (mutations in MLL2, HATs, ubiquitously transcribed 
tetratricopeptide repeat, X chromosome [ UTX] , etc.) and/or effects of EZH2 inhibitors on the 
tumor microenvironment.    
2.3. Solid Tumors  
In addition to the EZH2 gain of function activation mutations described above, overexpression or amplification of EZH2 has been described in numerous tumor types, including not but limited to bladder, breast cancer, colorectal, lung, pancreatic, ovarian, prostate, mesothelioma, uveal melanoma, re nal carcinoma, cholangiocarcinoma and stomach cancer [ LaFave 2015, Comet  
2016, Kuroki 2014].   This is partially explained by the regulation of EZH2 gene expression by 
the pRB-E2F pathway, which is dysregulated in many tumor types [ Bracken 2003]. In many of 
these tumors, EZH2 has been demonstrated to function as an oncogene [ Comet 2016] . For 
instance, EZH2 overexpression promotes anchorage-independent growth and cell invasion in breast cancer [ Kleer 2003], proliferation and epithelial- mesenchymal transition in lung cancer 
[Takawa 2011, Tiwari  2013], and tumorigenesis and metastasis in prostate cancer [ Min 2010]. 
These data suggest that inhibition of EZH2 might also be beneficial in solid tumors that overexpress EZH2 or contain amplifications of the EZH2 gene. 
Genetic changes in other proteins in addition to genetic alterations in EZH2 itself, can lead to an 
oncogenic dependency on EZH2 activity, specifically those affecting proteins of the SWItch/Sucrose Non -Fermentable (SWI/SNF) chromatin remodeling complex.  At many gene 
loci, polycomb repressive complex (PRC2) and SWI/SNF antagonize each other and loss of the

 SWI/SNF component, integrase interactor 1 (INI1), has been demonstrated to generate over-
activation of the PRC2 pathway and tumor cell proliferation [ Wilson, 2010]. Genetic loss of INI1 
has been described in many human malignancies, e.g., rhabdoid tumors, epithelioid sarcoma, epithelioid malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor, extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma, myoepithelial carcinoma,  and renal medullary carcinoma [ Margol, 2014]. Inhibition of EZH2 
activity by either knock -down or small molecule inhibition induces tumor cell killing and 
durable tumor regressions in pre-clinical models of rhabdoid tumors [ Alimova  2013; Knutson 
2013].   Genetic alterations in synovial sarcomas can create a state of INI1 deficiency and result 
in aberrant SWI/SNF complex chromatin remodeling activity at various genes [ Kadoch, 2013], 
sensitizing these tumors to EZH2 inhibition [ Kawano , 2016]. Loss of SMARCA2 and 
SMARCA4 protein, the redundant catalytic subunits of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling 
complex, have been described in small cell carcinoma of the ovary, hypercalcemic type [ Jellinic 
2014; Ramos 2014; Witkowski 2014], and inhibition of EZH2 activity in in vivo prec linical 
models by a small molecule inhibitor results in dose dependent tumor growth inhibition and regressions [Penebre 2017]. It has additionally been postulated that additional tumor types with loss or mutation of SWI/SNF subunits, such as ovarian cancer with loss of ARID1A, would also be sensitive to EZH2 inhibition [ Bitler 2015; Kim 2015]. Given that approximately 20% of 
tumors contain a mutation in one or more subunit of the SWI/SNF complex, this suggests that EZH2 inhibition might have therapeutic value in a diverse number of solid tumor types [ Kadoch 
2016]. 
Finally, genetic and/or protein loss of chromatin remodelers other than SWI/SNF have been 
associated with sensitivity to EZH2 inhibition. For instance, BRACA1 associated protein 1 (BAP1) can also l ead to an oncogen ic dependency on EZH2 activity [ LaFave 2015]. This is 
clinically relevant as genetic and/or protein loss of BAP1 has also been described in multiple human malignancies including mesothelioma, uveal melanoma, renal carcinoma, and cholangioc arcinoma [ Testa 2011; Harbour 2010; Pena-Llopis 2012; Jiao 2013].  
2.4. Tazemetostat 
2.4.1 Preclinical Pharmacology  
Tazemetostat (EPZ -6438) is a selective oral small molecule inhibitor of EZH2.   Tazemetostat 
inhibits both wild -type EZH2 and mutant bearing EZH2 residues  with Y641, A667G and A687 
with half maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50) ranging from 2-38 nmol/L.  The compound shows a 35- fold selectivity over the most closely related HMT, EZH1 , and greater than a 4500-
fold selectively over other HMTs.   It selectively inhibits intracellular H3K27 methylation in a 
concentration - and time- dependent manner, leading to selective cell killing of cell lines.

 Tazemetostat specifically inhibits human lymphoma cell lines bearing EZH2 point mutations and 
integrase interacto r 1 (INI1 ) unit deficient (also known as SNF5, SMARCB1, or BAFT47) MRT 
cell lines with IC50 in the nanomolar range.  Additionally, tazemetostat administered orally has 
demonstrated antitumor activity in vivo against several EZH2 mutant human lymphoma xenog raft murine models [ Knutson, 2014].    
2.4.2 Lymphomas  
Antitumor effects of oral tazemetostat dosing were evaluated in 3 EZH2  mutant DLBCL 
xenograft models; WSU -DLCL2 EZH2  Y646F, KARPAS -422 EZH2  Y646N, and Pfeiffer EZH2  
A682G.   In severe combined immunodeficiency ( SCID ) mice bearing WSU- DLCL2 EZH2  
Y646F mutant xenograft tumors, tazemetostat  induced dose -dependent tumor growth inhibition, 
showing a maximum of 58% at the highest dose of 160  mg/kg 3 times daily.   A dose -dependent 
incre ase in plasma and tumor tissue exposure was observed.   ELISA analysis of histones from 
tumors collected on Day  28 indicated dose- dependent reduction in H3K27Me3 levels.  
In KARPAS -422 EZH2  Y646N mutant xenografts, 28-day dosing of tazemetostat on a twice 
daily (BID) schedule induced tumor growth inhibition at doses as low as 80.5 mg/kg BID, but all 
higher doses induced complete xenograft tumor regression ( Figure 1A ). When investigating 
intermittent dosing schedules in this model, tazemetostat  showed significant dose -dependent 
antitumor effects with 2 cycles of 7 -day on/7 -day off and 21 day on/7 day off  schedules 
(Figure 1B ).  For all dosing schedules, tumor growth inhibition and complete regressions were 
observed at 90 and 361 mg/kg BID, respectively.  In a paralle l study, the inhibition of 
H3K27Me3 by tazemetostat  was evaluated in KARPAS -422 human DLBCL xenografts in 
athymic mice.   Tazemetostat induced a dose -dependent reduction of tumor H3K27Me3 levels 
with both regimens ( Figure 2 ).

The Pfeiffer EZH2  A682G mutant xenograft model was the most sensitive DLBCL tumor model.   
Complete tumor regressions were  observed in all animals in the 114 mg/kg tazemetostat  once 
daily and 342 mg/kg once daily dose groups. Tumor regrowth was not observed up to the end of 
the study (36 days after stopping tazemetostat  administration).  
2.4.3 Solid T umors  
Oral administration of tazemetostat in 4 NSCLC cell line xenografts with dual SMARCA2/A4  
loss demonstrated inhibition of tumor growth or tumor regression s.  As shown in  Figure 3, tumor 
regression was observed in the NCI H522 and NCI -H661 NSCLC xenograft models at ≥ 125  
mg/kg and ≥ 250 mg/kg, respectively .  Significant tumor growth inhibition but not tumor 
regression s was seen in the A427 and NCI-H1703 NSCLC xenografts at ≥ 250 mg/kg.  In 
addition, antitumor activity was observed in xenograft models of INI -1 deficient tumors.  The 
most robust antitumor activity was demonstrated in the G401 INI1-negative human malignant rhabdoid tumor (MRT) xenograft model following oral dosing with tazemetostat.  Figure 4 A and

 2.4.4 In Vitro Aqueous Solubility  
The solubility of tazemetostat was investigated in buffer systems of pH 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.5, and 
6.8.  Mean solubility of tazemetostat was approximately 7 mg/mL at pH values of 1.0 to 4.0.  However, mean aqueous solubility of tazemetostat decreased to 0.508 mg/mL and 0.0333 
mg/mL at pH 5.5 and pH 6.8, respectively.  The pH values at which the aqueous solubility changes are similar to the pKa values for tazemetostat of 5.3 and 6.9. 
2.4.5 Nonclinical Pharmacokinetics  
Sixteen metabolites of tazemetostat were identified from incubations of liver microsomes and 
hepatocytes from mouse, rat, dog, monkey, and human. The major metabolites in liver microsomal incubations were the result of N -deethylation (M5, EPZ-6930), oxidation of the 
pyridone (M7), and dual oxidation (M12). The major metabolites in hepatocyte incubations were the results of oxidation and dehydrogenation (M11), and N-dealkylation of the pyridone (M13). EPZ-6930 appeared to be the major metabo lite formed in liver microsomes and hepatocytes from 
monkey and human. There was no metabolite observed that was considered to be unique to humans. 
Results from in vitro studies with human liver microsomes suggested that CYP3A, CYP2C8, and 
CYP2D6 were involved in the metabolism of tazemetostat. In experiments using recombinant human CYPs (Supersomes
TM), CYP3A4 was the only isoform which caused detectable turnover 
of tazemetostat. Taken together, these results suggest that CYP3A4 is the predominant enzyme involved in tazemetostat metabolism with potentially lesser contributions from CYP2C8 and CYP2D6. 
Tazemetostat inhibited CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A (testosterone 6β-
hydroxylation) activities in vitro with Ki values of 1.3, 15.0, 6.7, 9.2, and 3.1  µmol/L, 
respectively.   The IC
50 values for tazemetostat inhibition of CYP3A -mediated midazolam 1' 
hydroxylation and nifedipine dehydrogenation in vitro were 12.7 and 19.4 µmol/L, respectively.  Tazemetostat demonstrated time-dependent inhibition of CYP3A with a half- maximum 
inactivation of 6.4 µmol/L and maximum rate constant of inactivation of 0.077 min
-1.  
Tazemetostat induced CYP3A4 in human hepatocytes in vitro with concentration that achieved 50% of the maximal effect values of 2.18 to 2.96 µmol /L, and maximum effect values of 15.62- 
to 103.5-fold increase in mRNA. Tazemetostat may induce other CYP isoforms, such as CYP1A, CYP2B6, and CYP2C9, but the effect is expected to be much weaker than that observed for induction of CYP3A4.

 A physiologicall y-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model was developed based on in vitro and in 
vivo data to simulate the effect of tazemetostat on CYP probe substrates.   The model was used to 
predict the magnitude of interaction of tazemetostat with probe substrates for CYP2 C8 
(repaglinide and rosiglitazone), CYP2C9 (S-warfarin), and CYP2C19 (omeprazole and S-
mephenytoin) based upon the in vitro Ki and protein binding values.  Simulations also were conducted to predict the magnitude of interaction of tazemetostat given a wors t-case scenario 
with Ki values 10 -fold lower than the observed in vitro values and a fraction unbound of 0.2.  
Results of the analysis indicated that interactions between tazemetostat and substrates for 
CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and CYP2C 19 likely will be negligible  based on observed in vitro estimates 
of K
i for ta zemetostat.   However, the worst- case scenario for tazemetostat is to cause a 1.30 - to 
1.55-fold and 1.39- to 2.40-fold increase in the exposure of CYP2C8 and CYP2C19 substrates, respectively, at tazemetostat doses ranging from 400 to 1600 mg BID. 
2.4.6 Clinical Pharmacokine tics  
The PK of tazemetostat and the desethyl metabolite, EPZ -6930, have been characterized 
following single (Day 1) and multiple (Day 15) dose administration to subjects with advanced 
solid tum ors or B -cell lymphoma (n=36). Doses administered were 100 mg BID as a suspension 
(n=3) or tablet (n=3) formulation and 200, 400, 800, and 1600 mg BID as a tablet formulation. Tazemetostat was absorbed rapidly with a time to the maximum plasma concentratio n (T
max) of 
approximately 1-2 hours postdose .  Plasma concentrations declined in a mono -exponential 
manner with a mean t 1/2 of approximately 3-5 hours, and quantifiable plasma concentrations of 
both tazemetostat and its metabolite, EPZ -6930, were observed up to 12 hours post dose.  The 
tazemetostat maximum plasma concentration ( Cmax) and area under the concentration -time curve 
(AUC) increased in a greater than dose-proportional fashion after a single dose and in an approximately a dose-proportional fashion at steady -state.    
After multiple dosing, there was a dose- dependent decrease in tazemetostat exposure between 
Days 1 and 15.  Accumulation ratios (R
ac = AUC D15/AUC D1) evaluated at Day 15 of dosing were 
0.89 at 100 mg BID (suspension) and 0.48 at 1600 mg B ID.  The R ac at the RP2D of 800  mg BID 
was 0.58.  Further reduction in systemic exposure at steady -state was not observed beyond 
Day 15 as evidenced by pre dose Ctrough (observed concentration at the end of a dosing interval, 
immediately before the next adm inistration) levels from Days 15 to 29.  There was negligible 
change in T max or t 1/2 on multiple dosing across the dose range.     
The Tmax for the tazemetostat metabolite EPZ -6930 was observed at 1 to 2 hours after 
tazemetostat administration and its elim ination paralleled that of tazemetostat (t 1/2 = 3 – 5 hours).

 In contrast to the parent compound, C max and AUC of the metabolite increased after multiple 
dosing.  Metabolite -to-parent AUC ratios (EPZ -6930 relative to tazemetostat) ranged from 
approximately 0.57 to 1.3 on Day 1 and from 1.1 to 2.1 on Day 15.  EPZ-6930 T max was 
observed at 1 -2 hours post dose and its elimination paralleled that of tazemetostat (t ½ =3-5 hours).  
The time -dependency in kinetics of both parent and the desethyl metabolite are consistent with 
induction of CYP3A- mediated metabolism by tazemetostat.    
The effect of food on the PK of tazemetostat was investigated as part of Study E7438 -G000-101.  
Subjects with advanced solid tumors or B- cell lymphomas received 200 mg tazemetostat in 
either the fasted state or immediately after consuming a high -fat breakfast in a randomized, 
crossover fashion.   Serial blood samples for the analysis of plasma tazemetostat concentrations 
were collected over 24 hours after dosing.   A summary of the prelimi nary PK parameters from 
the food effect portion of Study E7438-G000-101 is displayed in Table 4 .

 Administration of tazemetostat with a high -fat meal decreased geometric mean AUC 0-∞ and C max 
values approximately 18% and 38%, respectively, relative to administration in the fasted state.   
However, the 90% CI for the fed: fasted  geometric mean ratio for both C max and AUC 0-∞ 
contained 1.  Administration of tazemetostat with a high -fat meal also resulted in a 4 -fold 
increase in median T max relative to administration in the fasted state.   Geometric mean  t1/2 values 
were nearly identical after administration in the fed and fasted state (4.24 h and 4.10 h, 
respectively).   These results indicate that administration of tazemetostat with a high -fat breakfast 
results in slower absorption into the systemic circulation with no effect on the systemic disposition or overall exposure to tazemetostat as measured by AUC.   The decrease in systemic 
exposure is not clinically significant, and therefore tazemetostat can be taken without regards to meals.  
The effect of  tazemetostat on the PK of midazolam also was investigated as part of Study E7438 -
G000-101.  Subjects with solid tumors (n=13) received a single oral dose of 2 mg midazolam on Day -1 and on Day 15.  Tazemetostat 800 mg BID was administered continuously starting on 
Day 1.   Serial blood samples for the analysis of plasma midazolam and metabolites were 
collected over 24 h on Day - 1 (midazolam alone) and Day 15 (midazolam plus tazemetostat).  
A summary of preliminary midazolam PK parameters after administration alone (Day -1) and 
with tazemetostat 800 mg BID (Day 15) in subject s with solid tumors is presented in Table 6 .

CYP3A -mediated metabolism in subjects with solid tumors.  The decrease in midazolam AUC 0-∞ 
caused by concomitant administration with tazemetostat 800 mg BID was less than 50%.  
Therefore, tazemetostat 800 mg administered BID is  a weak inducer of CYP3A -mediated 
metabolism.  
2.4.7 Clinical Experience 
In 2013, Study E7438-G000-101, a single- agent, Phase 1/2 study of tazemetostat in adult 
subjects with advanced B- cell lymphomas or advanced solid tumors for which there was no 
known effectiv e therapy was initiated.   Enrollment in Phase 2 is continuing.  Three  additional 
studies have also been initiated and are currently recruiting subjects:  
• EZH -102, A Phase 1 Study of the EZH2 Inhibitor Tazemetostat in Pediatric Subjects with 
Relapsed or Ref ractory INI1 -Negative Tumors or Synovial Sarcoma  
• EZH -202 A Phase 2, Multicenter Study of the EZH2 Inhibitor Tazemetostat in Adult 
Subjects with INI1 -Negative Tumors or Relapsed/Refractory Synovial Sarcoma    
• EZH -203, A Phase 2, Multicenter Study of the EZH2 Inhibitor Tazemetostat in Adult 
Subjects with Relapsed or Refractory Malignant Mesothelioma with BAP1 Loss of 
Function   
As of the cutoff date of 15 -Jan. 2016, subjects with advanced solid tumors or B- cell lymphoma 
(N=88), or with INI-negative tumors (N=1) have been enrolled and exposed to tazemetostat in 
these 3 studies.  
As of the 15-Jan. 2016 cutoff date, 78 of 89 (87.6%) subjects experienced  one or more treatment -
emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and 51 of 89 (57.3%) subjects experienced TEAEs that were considered by the investigator to be related to tazemetostat. The most common TEAEs, any 
grade, in descending order of frequency were asthenia, nausea, thrombocytopenia, decreased appetite, anemia, constipation, dysgeusia, vomiting, diarrhea, dry skin, dyspnea, muscle spasms, and abdominal pain. Twenty-two (22) of 89 (24.7%) subjects experienced Grade 3 or 4 AEs, 7 (7.9%) of which were considered related to study drug. Five (5.6%) subjects in the study discontinued tazemetostat treatment due to AEs.

 In addition, 22 subjects experienced a total of 31 serious adverse events (SAE). Of these, 
4 (12.9%) were considered possibly related to study drug (neutropenia [2], anemia [1], and thrombocytopenia [1]).  Eleven subjects died in Study E7438-G000-101.  Nine of the  deaths 
were attributed to progressive disease, one event was attributed to an AE, and one death was 
reported as “not due to progressive disease” (no further information available at time of data cutoff date of 15 -Jan. 2016).   
As of 07 -Nov. 2015, antitumo r activity has been noted (phase 1 part only) in subjects with B- cell 
lymphoma and with INI1-deficient tumors. Objective responses were demonstrated in 9 of 16 subjects  (5/10 with DLBCL, 3/5 with FL, and 1/1 with MZL) with B -cell lymphoma ( 2 complete 
responses [CR] and 7 partial responses [PR]) and in 4 of 11  subjects with INI1- deficiency (one 
CR and 3 PRs) who were evaluable for response per protocol (defined as having measurable 
disease, and least one post- baseline scan, and received at least one dose of study drug). Of the 9 
subjects with objective responses, 4 remained on study treatment for 41 to 68 weeks. Tazemetostat has shown clear evidence of robust clinical activity in subjects with genetically defined INI1 negative tumors consisting of 3 of 6 subjects showing objective response (1 CR + 2 PRs) within 8 weeks of receiving the first dose of study treatment.   A fourth INI1 -negative 
subject has experienced tumor reduction, but did not meet RECIST 1.1 criteria for PR at the first re-stagin g at 8 weeks.  Further information on clinical efficacy and safety can be found in the 
tazemetostat Investigator’s Brochure (IB), Version 8.0. 
2.5. Study and Dose Rationale 
2.5.1 Study Rationale  
Tazemetostat is metabolized primarily by CYP3A4 in vitro.   Inhibition o f CYP3A4/5 in vivo is 
expected to result in increased systemic exposure to tazemetostat.   Therefore, Part A of this study 
will determine the effect of a moderate CYP3A inhibitor, fluconazole, on tazemetostat PK.  
Tazemetostat inhibited multiple CYP isoforms in vitro.   The most potent inhibition (lowest Ki 
values) was for the CYP2C8 and CYP3A isoforms followed by CYP2C19.  The effect of 
tazemetostat on the PK of the sensitive CYP3A probe midazolam was determined in Study 
E7438-G000-101.  Therefore, Part B of  this study will determine the effect of tazemetostat on 
the PK of the CYP2C8 probe medication repaglinide and the CYP2C19 probe medication 
omeprazole.    
The solubility of tazemetostat is pH dependent and an increase in gastric pH may alter the oral absorption of tazemetostat.   In addition to a CYP2C19 probe medication, omeprazole is a 
tazemetostat  Protocol Number EZH -105 
Amendment 4.0  
  
 
   
Epizyme, Inc . Page 42 of 116 
Confidential  28 September 2018 
 
 medication that increases gastric pH.   The effect of increased gastric pH on the PK of 
tazemetostat will be determined in Part B by the concomitant administration of om eprazole for 4 
days.    
2.5.2 Dose Rationale  
2.5.2.1. Tazemetostat 
The safety, tolerability, clinical activity, PK, and pharmacodynamic (PD) assessments from the 
subjects treated in the Dose Escalation part of Study E7438-G000- 101 were used to select the 
recommended P hase 2 dose (RP2D).   As of 07 -Nov. 2015, 58 subjects with advanced or 
metastatic solid tumors or B -cell lymphomas had been included in the Phase 1 Dose Escalation 
part of the study. Clinical activity of tazemetostat  was observed at dose levels of 100, 200, 800, 
and 1600 mg BID, including objective responses observed in 9 of 16 response- evaluable subjects 
with B -cell lymphoma who have had tumor assessments while on study drug. Objective 
responses were observed in 5/10 DLBCL, 3/5 FL, and 1/1 MZL subjects. An MTD was not established with tazemetostat  doses of up to 1600 mg BID. 
A relationship between tazemetostat AUC on Day 15 and inhibition of H3K27Me3 in the stratum spinosum was observed and described by an inhibitory E
max model. The tazemetostat AUC 0-12 at 
whic h the H3K27Me3 inhibition was 50% of maximal (EC 50) was 848 ng*h/mL and the 
maximum effect (E max) was 51% inhibition.  The predicted inhibition of H3K27Me3 in the 
stratum spinosum skin layer at the observed median Day 15 AUC 0-12 in the 800 mg BID  dose 
coho rt (3670 ng*h/mL) was over 80% of E max.  These results suggest that target inhibition in the 
skin was near maximal at 800 mg tazemetostat BID and doubling the dose to 1600 mg BID  
results in only an incremental increase in the inhibition of the H3K27 methyl ation.   Furthermore, 
the greatest number of objective responses was observed in the 800 mg BID cohort during the Dose Escalation part of the study.   Therefore, 800 mg tazemetostat BID was selected as the 
RP2D.   The RP2D was selected to investigate the effect of tazemetostat on CYP2C8 - and 
CYP2C19 -mediated metabolism and the effect of increased gastric pH on the PK of tazemetostat 
in the current study.  
2.5.2.2. Fluconazole plus Tazemetostat  
Fluconazole doses up to 400 mg daily may be used to treat candida infections and for prophylaxis in patients undergoing bone marrow transplantation.  Administration of a single dose of 400 mg fluconazole followed by 200 mg fluconazole daily for 5 days increased midazolam (a sensitive CYP3A probe substrate) AUC and C
max 259% and 150%, respectively, after oral 
tazemetostat  Protocol Number EZH -105 
Amendment 4.0  
  
 
   
Epizyme, Inc . Page 43 of 116 
Confidential  28 September 2018 
 
 administration of 7.5 mg relative to administration of midazolam alone.   The highest dose of 
tazemetostat investigated in the Dose Escalation and D ose Expansion phases of Study E7438-
G000-101 was 1600 mg BID.  The r esults of the effect of fluconazole on systemic exposure to 
midazolam suggest that a dministration of tazemetostat 800 mg BID in the presence of CYP3A 
inhibition by 400 mg fluconazole once daily may result in systemic exposure to tazemetostat 
greater than t hat observed in the 1600 mg BID cohort in Study E7435-G000-101.  Therefore, 
tazemetostat 400 mg BID will be administered in Part A of the current study and continue 
through Day 24 to allow for sufficient wash- out of fluconazole.   The tazemetostat RP2D of 8 00 
mg BID will then be administered starting on Day 25, 6 days following the last dose of fluconazole.  
2.5.2.3. Repaglinide  
The starting dose for repaglinide in patients not previously treated or whose hemoglobin A1c 
(HbA
1c) is < 8% is 0.5 mg administered with each  meal.   A dose of 0.25 mg repaglinide was 
selected to minimize the effect on blood glucose in subjects in this study. 
2.5.2.4. Omeprazole  
The recommended dose of omeprazole to treat duodenal ulcers and gastro -esophageal reflux is 
20 mg once daily for 4 to 8 weeks.  A daily dose of 20 mg omeprazole was reported to maintain 
a median gastric pH of 4.5 over 24 hours [ Houben, 1995].  Therefore, omeprazole 20 mg once 
daily was selected to determine the effect of tazemetostat on CYP2C19 -mediat ed metabolism 
and to investigate the effect of increased gastric pH on the PK of tazemetostat .   
2.6. Benefit: Risk Assessments 
2.6.1 Animal Toxicology 
Nonclinical safety assessments of tazemetostat included in vitro and monkey safety 
pharmacology studies, genotoxicity studies, and single- and repeat -dose toxicity studies in 
Sprague-Dawley rats and cynomolgus monkeys of 4- and 13 weeks duration. No notabl e 
cardiovascular, central nervous system (CNS), or respiratory risks were identified in nonclinical safety pharmacology assessments. Tazemetostat was not genotoxic in standard in vitro and in vivo assays. The following potential risks were identified for t azemetostat based on nonclinical 
safety data: T -LBL (rat), increased bone formation in bone and teeth (rat), non- progressive bile 
duct hyperplasia (monkey), teratogenicity (rat and rabbit), lymphoid depletion (rat and monkey), and phototoxic potential (in vitro). Other effects at high, non- tolerated doses, toxicities included 
tazemetostat  Protocol Number EZH -105 
Amendment 4.0

Confidential  28 September 2018 
 
 bone marrow effects (hypocellularity, rat), and gastrointestinal toxicity (distention, ulceration, 
and degeneration, rat).  
Steady -state exposures (area under the concentration –time cu rve from 0 to 24 hours [AUC0- 24]) 
in rats at the lowest dose (100 mg/kg/day) at which no T- LBL occurred in the 13- week 
adolescent rat study were 2.5- to 7.5-fold greater than that observed in humans at the 
recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D; 800 mg twice daily [BID]) from the ongoing Phase 1/2 Study E7438-G000-101. No incidences of abnormal bone formation have been observed in the ongoing clinical study. Female subjects of reproductive age will provide blood and urine samples for pregnancy testing at screening. All subjects must agree to use a reliable birth control method 
during the study, and for 30 days after the last tazemetostat dose, and additionally will be actively monitored for signs or symptoms of abnormal bone formation.      
2.6.2 Photo -Reactive Potential  
There are nonclinical data supporting a potential for phototoxicity, which has not been evaluated 
in humans. Hence, prolonged exposure to sunlight should be avoided during treatment. In addition, subjects should take other measures to avoid ultraviolet (UV ) exposure such as wearing 
sun screen and sun glasses, wearing protective clothing, and avoiding tanning beds. Refer to the tazemetostat Investigator’s Brochure 8.0 for details . 
2.6.3 Metabolism and Transporters  
Tazemetostat is metabolized primarily by CYP3A and  is a substrate for P -glycoprotein (Pgp).  
Therefore, treatment with strong inhibitors or strong inducers of CYP3A within 7 days prior to the first dose of tazemetostat and for the duration of study treatment is prohibited. Treatment 
with moderate inhibito rs, other than fluconazole administered in Part A of the current study, is 
prohibited within 7 days prior to the first dose of tazemetostat until after the final PK sample is drawn on Day 19. Tazemetostat also was shown to be a time-dependent CYP3A inhibitor and a CYP3A4 inducer as  well as an inhibitor of Pgp, CYP2D6, and the CYP2C family in vitro.   Pgp, 
CYP3A, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6 substrates should be used with caution.  Medications that are substrates for CYP3A, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, or CYP2D6 , and that 
have a narrow therapeutic range should be avoided if possible. 
2.6.4 Anticipated Safety Profile 
In addition to the overall incidence of TEAEs as described in Section 2.2.5,  the most frequently 
reported TEAEs (all grades and in descending order) that occurred in ≥ 5% of subjects enrolled 
in the P hase 1 part of study   E7438-G000-101 included the following  (as of the 15-Jan.2016 
cutoff  date, n = 62):  Asthenia (34.8%), nausea (15.7%), thrombocytopenia (14.6%), decreased

 appetite (13.5%), anemia (12.4%), constipation (12.4%), dysgeusia (7.9%), vomiting (7.9%), 
diarrhea (6.7%), dry skin (6.7%), dyspnea (6.7%) muscle spasms (6.7%), abdominal pain (5.6%) and neutropenia (5.6%).  TEAEs did not appear to be dose dependent.  There have been 3 
Grade  4 TEAEs, which occurred in one  subject each: thrombocytopenia (1 subject) and 
neutropenia (2 subjects).  All 3 events were considered related to study drug and required 
withdrawal of study drug.   For up -to date information on AESIs, see Section 11.5. Additionally,  
there is the unknown risk of abnormal pregnancy outcomes and drug- drug interactions  (DDI) . 
Based on the pre clinical toxicology of tazemetostat, the potential risks associated with treatment 
include bone AEs and photosensitivity . 
2.7. Good Clinical Practice (GCP)  
The principal investigator will ensure that the basic principles of GCP, as outlined in 21 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 312, subpart D, “Responsibilities of Sponsors and Investigators,” 21 CFR, Part 50 (1998) and 21 CFR, Part 56, (1998) are followed.  
Since this is a covered clinical trial, the principal investigator is adhered to 21 CFR, Part 54, 
(1998).  A covered clinical trial is any “study of a drug  or device in humans submitted in a 
marketing application or reclassification petition subject to this part that the applicant or FDA relies on to establish that the product is effective (including studies that show equivalence to an effective product) or that make a significant contribution to the demonstration of safety.”  This 
requires that investigators and all sub -investigators must provide documentation of their financial 
interest or arrangements with Epizyme, Inc. or proprietary interests in the drug being studied. This documentation must be provided prior to the participation of the principal investigator and any sub -investigator. The principal investigator and sub- investigator agree to notify Epizyme, 
Inc. of any change in reportable interests during the study and for one year following completion of the study. Study completion is defined as the date that the last subject has completed the protocol -defined activities.

 4. STUDY DESIGN 
4.1.  Study Sites  
This study will be conducted at 3 sites in the US.  
4.2. Overview of Study Design 
This is a Phase 1, open-label, 2- part, safety, PK , and activity study designed to characterize the 
DDI potential of tazemetostat.   Tazemetostat will be tak en orally BID continuously in 28- day 
cycles  in both study parts.  Subjects in Part A will receive tazemetostat 400 mg BID 
continuously for 24 days starting on Day 1.  Tazemetostat 800 mg BID then will be administered 
continuously starting the morning of Day 25.  Subjects in Part B will receive tazemetostat 
800 mg BID continuously starting on Day 2.  Adequate supplies of tazemetostat to be  taken at 
home will be dispens ed to subjects on scheduled clinic days. On clinic days when blood samples 
are taken , subjects will be given morning tazemetostat doses at the clinic .   
Part A .  On the morning of Day 1, subjects will begin treatment with oral tazemetostat tablets 
400 mg B ID.  Subjects will be given sufficient supply of tazemetostat to continue treatment 
through Day 14.  Subjects will check  in to the clinic on the morning of Day 15 prior to the 
morning dose of 400 mg tazemetostat.  Blood samples for the analysis of tazemeto stat and 
metabolites will be collected predose and over 8 hours after the morning dose of tazemetostat on 
Day 15.  Subjects will receive fluconazole 400 mg tablets , which will be taken once daily  for 
4 days starting on Day 16.  On the morning of Day 19, subjects will check  in to the clinic and 
serial blood samples for the analysis of  tazemetostat and its metabolites , and fluconazole will be 
collected predose and over 8 hours after the morning tazemetostat dose.   Subjects will receive 
tazemetostat 400 mg BID until the evening dose on Day 24.  Tazemetostat 800 mg BID will be administered starting on Day 25 and continue until the subject withdraws from the study. 
Part B .  Subjects enrolled in Part B will check in t o the clinic on the morning of Day 1 and will 
receive oral doses of repaglinide 0.25 mg and omeprazole 20 mg.  Blood samples for analysis of 
plasma repaglinide and its metabolites, omeprazole, 5- OH-omeprazole, and omeprazole sulfone 
will be collected over 7 hours after administration on Day 1.  Subje cts will be  able to leave the 
clinic  after the last PK blood sample is collected and also will be given a sufficient supply of 
tazemetostat for home administration of tazemetostat 800 mg BID for 14 days starting on Day 2.  
Subjects will return to the clinic on Day 16, prior to the scheduled morning dose of tazemetostat.  
Subjects will receive the morning dose of tazemetostat , followed 1 hour (± 5 minutes)  later by 
oral doses of repaglinide 0.25 mg and omeprazole 20 mg.  Blood samples for analysis of plasma 
tazemetostat and its metabolites, repaglinide and its metabolite s, omeprazole, 5- OH-omeprazole, 
and omeprazole sulfone will be collected predose and over 8 hours after administration of 
tazemetostat  Protocol Number EZH -105

 tazemetostat on Day 16.   Subjects will continue to receive omeprazole 20 mg once daily in the 
morning on Days 17 through 19, inclusive.  On Day 19, blood samples for analysis of plasma 
tazemetostat and its metabolites will be collected over 8 hours after the morning dose. Subjects 
will ag ain be given an adequate supply of tazemetostat to last until the next scheduled clinic day.  
Upon initiation of tazemetostat treatment, all subjects enrolled in this study will receive oral 
tazemetostat for up to 6 months (24 weeks) or until they have an unacceptable toxicity, disease 
progression, or withdraw consent.  Subjects may be transitioned to Study EZH -501, at the 
investigator’s discretion, after completing all study assessments in EZH -105 and at least 6 
months of treatment with tazemetostat.   Subjects enrolling in the EZH- 501 study will transition 
to 200 mg tazemetostat tablets from 400 mg tablets (as administered in EZH-105).  Subjects who are enrolled in the study and do not complete all study assessments, or who do not transition to Study EZH -501 must have a post- treatment follow -up visit within 30 days of the last dose of 
tazemetostat. In addition, subjects who discontinue treatment with tazemetostat and do not 
transition to the EZH -501 study, will be followed for OS.   
Supplementary study conduct information not mandated to be present in this protocol is provided 
in the accompanying procedure manuals (i.e., laboratory, pharmacy, ECG, and imaging manuals).  Such manuals will provide the site personnel with administrative and detailed technical information that does not impact subject safety .

 5. STUDY POPULATION  
5.1. Target Population  
Approximately 32 subjects will be enrolled to achieve 12 subjects who  complete each part of the 
study.   Subjects will complete either Part A or Part B.  
See Section 13.2.1 for sample size assumptions. 
5.2. Inclusion Criteria

first dose of study treatment until the last PK blood sample is collected.   Subjects should avoid 
prolonged exposure to sunlight while receiving study drug.  In addition, subjects should take other measures to avoid UV exposure such as wearing sun screen and sun glasses, wearing protective clothing, and avoiding tanning beds. 
7.3. Dose Modification s:  Criteria for Retreatment, Temporary Discontinuation of 
Treatment, Dose Reduction, and Resumption of Treatment  
Tazemetostat dos e reductions and interruptions are not permitted during the first 19 days of 
treatment  (both parts of the study).  However, subjects will be replaced if a dose reduction  is 
necessary in order to manage toxicity within the first 19 days.  Subjects who miss 2 or more 
consecutive tazemetostat doses during the first 19 days of treatment or miss more than 3 
tazemetostat doses total during the first 19 days of treatment may be replaced. Tazemetostat  dose 
reductions and interruptions will be allowed following the first 19 days. An interruption in the 
administration of tazemetostat for more than 14 days must be discussed with the medical monitor before treatment can be resumed.  
Toxicity will be managed by concomitant medication (as appropriate), treatment interruption, 
dose reduction, and treatment discontinuation, or a combination of these. During treatment with 
tazemetostat, dose interruption and reduction for subjects who exper ience tazemetostat -related 
toxicity will be in accordance with the Dose Reduction and Interruption Instructions in Table 7 , 
which follows . For any cas e of T -LBL/T -ALL tazemetostat will be discontinued and patient will 
be followed until resolution of the event.  For any case of MDS/MPN/AML or other myeloid 
malignancy, tazemetostat will be held and after discussion with the I nvestigator, dose modify or 
discontinue the drug.

 7.4. Continuation of Treatment  
Subjects who are potentially benefitting (no signs or symptoms of progressive disease) from 
study treatment and have not incurred unacceptable toxicity, may continue treatment with 
tazemetostat by enrolling in Study EZH -501 at the i nvestigator’s discretion with the subject’s or 
his/her legal representative consent after completion of all study procedu res and at least 6 months 
of treatment with tazemetostat.    
7.5. Treatment Compliance  
The subject will be requested to maintain a medication diary of each dose of study treatment.   
The dosing diary will be returned to the site staff at each visit.   Tazemetostat  will be self -
administered at home on non- clinic days.  
7.6. Treatment of Overdose  
In the event of an overdose of tazemetostat (defined as administration of more than the protocol-specified dose), the investigator  should contact the medical monitor  or their desi gnee 
immediately and closely monitor the subject for AEs/SAEs and laboratory abnormalities.   
Decisions regarding dose interruptions or modifications will be made by the investigator  in 
consultation with the medical monitor  or their designee based on the s ubject’s clinical 
evaluation.   If tazemetostat  treatment is interrupted or discontinued due to an overdose, the 
subject should be monitored closely until tazemetostat can no longer be detected systemically.   
For reference, 5 half -lives of tazemetostat  would be at minimum 25 hours, longer in subject with 
delayed clearance.    
A plasma sample for PK analysis may be requested on a case- by-case basis.   If requested, the 
plasma sample should be collected at least within 7 days from the date of the last dose o f study 
treatment.  
The quantity of the excess dose as well as the duration of the overdosing should be documented 
in the electronic case report form ( eCRF ). 
7.7. Tazemetostat Duration of Treatment  
Treatment with tazemetostat for both parts in this study may co ntinue for up to 6 months 
(24 weeks)  or until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, or 
termination of the study by the sponsor.

 8.3.1 Physical Examinations 
8.3.1.1. Comprehensive Physica l Examination 
A comprehensive physical examination of all body systems must be performed at screening and 
on Day 1 of each treatment cycle starting with Cycle 2 by a qualified licensed individual.  A 
review of body systems will include the following: 
• General appearance  
• Skin 
• Head, Ears, Eyes, Nose, Throat (HEENT)  
• Respiratory  
• Cardiovascular  
• Abdomen (including liver and kidneys) 
• Neurological examination with sensory testing and seizure status, if applicable  
• Musculoskeletal  
Weight is required to be measur ed at screening, on the first day of each cycle starting with 
Cycle  2 and at the post -treatment visit.  
Height measurement is required at screening only. 
Any abnormalities or changes in intensity noted during the review of body systems should be 
documented  in the source document and reported appropriately in the eCRF.  If a new clinically 
significant finding (e.g., not noted at screening) occurs from the initial IP  administration until the 
end of the study, an AE must be documented.  In addition, resolution of any abnormal findings during the study will be noted in source document and the eCRF if clinically significant. 
These assessments will be completed as indicated in the Schedule of Assessments  and 
Procedures ( Table 1 and Table 2). 
8.3.1.2. Symptom -Directed Physical Examination 
A symptom- directed physical exami nation must be performed when a complete physical 
examination is not required by a qualified licensed individual.  This will consist of a focused 
review of systems and physical examination addressing any new symptoms, AEs, or complaints. 
These assessments will be completed as indicated in the Schedule of Assessments and 
Procedures ( Table 1 and Table 2).

The ECGs will be performed as indicated in the Schedule of Assessments and Procedures ( Table 
1 and Table 2). Machine -read ECGs should be reviewed by the investigator at the time of the 
assessment.   A single ECG will be recorded unless there is an abnormality, such as prolonged 
QTc F > 480 msec, ne w arrhythmia, or other clinically significant finding.   If such an 
abnormality is detected, the ECG should be performed in triplicate at least 2 minutes apart.   
Data from ECGs will be entered in the appropriate eCRFs.   
8.3.3 Optional Chest Ultrasound  
An optional chest ultrasound may be conducted every 8 weeks  at the Investigator’s discretion  
while on study to identify early signs of T- LBL/T- ALL.  
8.3.4 End of Study  Assessments  
End of study assessments will be conducted to review AESIs, PK and tumor response. A 3 mL 
blood sample will be required for end of study PK assessments.  
8.3.5 Disease Assessment  
Disease assessment will be performed as indicated in the Schedule of Assessments and 
Procedures ( See Schedule of Events Table  1 and Table 2).  Investigator tumor assessments will 
be performed based on Lugano Classification (Cheson 2014, Appendix  1) for lymphoma and 
RECIST v1.1 ( Appendix 2) for solid tumors at each assessment timepoint and entered into the 
appropriate eCRFs.  
8.3.6 Pharmacokinetics  
All PK blood samples may be drawn from either a central venous catheter or a peripherally 
placed intravenous catheter.

8.3.7 Pharmacogenomics (PGx)  
A single whole blood sample (10 mL) is to be collected during the screening phase to provide 
DNA for analysis of genes involved in drug disposition (i.e., absorption, distribution, 
metabolism , and excretion [ADME]).   This will support investigation of whether subject 
genotype, specifically of ADME genes, is related to the DDI potential of tazemetostat.

 8.3.8 Tumor  Tissue  Collection  
Archive formalin -fixed tumor tissue block or 10 -15 unstained slides are requested at screening 
from all subject s for molecular characterization , e.g., somatic mutation  detection, gene 
expression profiling, and/or proteomic analysis. As available the diagnostic pathology block or 
slides obtained at the time of the subject ’s diagnosis and/or time of subsequent procedures is 
acceptable. The sponsor or designee will return all blocks to the original site on completion of the planned analyses.  
An effort will be made to obtain  paired  tumor tissue biops ies before and after initiation of 
treatment with tazemetostat.   An optional lymph node, core-needle biopsy, or bone marrow 
biopsy will be performed during the screening period and on Day 1 of Cycle 2.  A window of 14 days before and after  Day 1 of Cycle 2 will be allowe d (i.e., biopsy must be done between Day 
14 of Cycle 1 and Day 14 of Cycle 2).  Biopsies will be performed by a surgeon, if necessary, or by interventional radiology.   A cytopathologist will evaluate the biopsy microscopically for 
tumor cells at the time o f the biopsy.  If multiple lymph nodes are available, the safest lymph 
node will be selected.  The choice of core biopsy versus incisional or excisional biopsy will be made based on safety, accessibility, and the likelihood of being pathologic.  If the subject has a single target lesion, this lesion will not be eligible for correlative biopsy.    
All subjects  will indicate consent or denial for the optional studies within the main consent form 
for this study.  
Tumor tissue may be analyzed for DNA, mRNA and/or protein endpoints up to and including whole genome analysis. The data generated (from subject s who enroll in EZH -501) will be 
combined with equivalent data from additional tazemetostat single-agent studies of NHL subject s to determine candidate biomarkers  of response to tazemetostat. The results of these 
analys es will be reported outside of this protocol.  
8.3.9 Clinical Laboratory Assessments 
All clinical laboratory assays will be performed at local laboratories according to the laboratory’s normal procedures.  Reference ranges will be supplied by the laboratory and used to assess the laboratory data for clinical significance and out of range pathological changes.   Abnormal 
laboratory values which are unexpected or not explained by the subject’s clinical conditio n 
should be repeated until confirmed, explained, or resolved.  Laboratory value changes starting from the initial tazemetostat exposure will be recorded in the eCRF as an AE if clinically significant.

 Hematology:  Hemoglobin, hematocrit, WBC, differential blood count with ANC, platelet count 
and peripheral blood smear morphology are performed at screening and at regular intervals.  
Bone Marrow Aspirate/Biopsy:  At screening, a peripheral blood  smear  will be collected  along  
with normal  hematology  testing  and assessed for abnormal morphology.  If results  are abnormal 
then the  patient will be required  to undergo a bone marrow  aspirate/biopsy  conducted by the 
local laboratory . If morphology  is abnormal, then cytogenetic testing  will be conducted to  
closely  monitor patients with cytogenetic testing and DNA sequencing for abnormalities  known 
to be associated  with  MDS  (e.g. del 5q, chr 7 abn) and MPN  (e.g. JAK2  V617F). If the results 
are abnormal (per the local laboratory) and are associated with myeloid malign ancies, the patient 
will be excluded from the study. 
During the study, additional tests including complete peripheral blood smear morphology 
assessment along with normal hematology testing will be included. If the morphology assessment shows abnormal results a bone marrow aspirate/biopsy will be required for cytogenetic testing  and DNA sequencing as conducted by the local laboratory . If cytogenetic 
testing  and DNA sequencing shows abnormal results, then tazemetostat will be held and after 
discussion with th e Investigator, dose will be modified or drug will be discontinued. 
Coagulation Profile :  This will include: partial thromboplastin (PT), partial thromboplastin time 
(PTT).  
Serum Chemistry :  Serum chemistries are performed at Screening and at regular inter vals.   
• Chemistries (liver function) include alkaline phosphatase, ALT, AST, conjugated 
(direct) bilirubin , and total bilirubin  
• Chemistries (renal function) include blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, and electrolytes  
• Chemistries (metabolism) include albumin,  calcium, magnesium, glucose, 
phosphorus, total protein, and triglycerides  
Refer to the Schedule of Assessment  and Procedures ( Tables 1  and 2) for additional details . 
8.3.9.1. Vital Sign Measurements  
Blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), and temperature must be measured after the subject has 
been sitting for 5 minutes.

 8.3.9.2. ECOG Performance Status  
Subject’s performance status will be assessed using the ECOG performance status tool  (see 
Appendix  3). 
8.3.10  Pregnancy  
There has been no experience to date of the use of tazemetostat during pregnancy or lactation. In 
an ongoing embryofetal development study, evidence of increased skeletal developmental abnormalities in fetuses from the pregnant rats relative to fetuses fro m control rats was observed. 
Consequently, there is a potential risk for teratogenicity, and precautions must be taken to avoid any pregnancy that could potentially be conceived during exposure to tazemetostat by EITHER male OR female subjects.  
8.3.10.1.    Definition of Childbearing Potential: Female Subjects  
A female subject is considered of childbearing potential if she: 
• Is anatomically and physiologically capable of becoming pregnant, and 
• Will be or could possibly be sexually active with a male while undergoing s tudy 
treatment with the possibility of posing harm to a fetus  
A female subject is considered to be of non -childbearing potential (i.e., physiologically incapable 
of becoming pregnant) if she: 
• Is post menopausal (at least 12 months consecutive amenorrheic, a t least 45 years of 
age, and has a follicle stimulating hormone level of >40 mIU/mL) , or 
• Is surgically sterilized (i.e., bilateral tubal ligation, total hysterectomy, or bilateral 
oophorectomy) with surgery at least 1 month before the first dose of study t reatment  
• Has a documented congenital or acquired disorder that is incompatible with 
pregnancy 
8.3.10.2. Definition of Childbearing Potential: Male Subjects  
A male subject is considered of childbearing potential if he:  
• Is anatomically and physiologically capable of c ausing a pregnancy in a female 
partner, and, 
• Will be or could possibly be sexually active with a female (who is or may become pregnant) while undergoing study treatment with the possibility of posing harm to a 
fetus .

 A male subject is considered to be of n on-childbearing potential if he: 
• Has a documented successful vasectomy (with confirmed azoospermia)  
8.3.10.3. Pregnancy Testing  
All female subjects must have a negative pregnancy test (urine or serum) at screening within 2 8 
days of the first dose of study treatment.   
Subsequent pregnancy tests should be performed pre dose on the first day of each treatment 
cycle, beginning with Cycle 2, and can be either serum or urine.  Any positive urine pregnancy 
test must be confirmed with a serum test.  
8.3.10.4.  Prevention  
8.3.10.4.1. Female Subje cts  
Females of childbearing potential must agree to use a highly effective method of contraception, that results in a failure rate of < 1% per year when used consistently and correctly, starting at 
screening, during study treatment, and for 30 days after the final dose of study treatment, and have a male partner who uses a condom  when using hormonal contraceptives.  
Acceptable highly effective contraception includes:  
• Placement of an intrauterine device  
• Established hormonal contraceptive methods: oral, injectable, or implant, plus an 
additional barrier method .  
NOTE: Female subjects who are using hormonal contraceptives must have been on a 
stable dose of the same hormonal contraceptive product for at least 4 weeks prior to the 
first dose of study treatme nt and must continue to use the same contraceptive during 
study treatment and for 30 days after discontinuation of study treatment.   
Due to the potential of enzyme induction with tazemetostat, female subjects who use 
hormonal contraceptives should use an additional barrier method of birth control while on study treatment and for 30 days after discontinuation of study treatment. 
Female subjects exempt from this requirement are subjects who practice true abstinence when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject (periodic abstinence [e.g., calendar, ovulation, sympto- thermal , post -ovulation methods], declaration of abstinence for the 
duration of the trial, and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception), or have a

 male p artner who is vasectomized. If currently abstinent, the subject must agree to use a highly 
effective method of contraception as described above if they become sexually active during 
study treatment, and for 30 days after discontinuation of study treatment.  
8.3.10.4.2. Male Subjects  
Male subjects of childbearing potential must agree to use of condoms with their female partner 
prior to enrollment, during study treatment, and for 30 days after the final dose of study treatment . 
8.3.10.5. Reporting of Pregnancy 
The investigator mus t attempt to collect and report to the sponsor or its designee pregnancy 
information on any female subjects or female partner of male study subjects who became 
pregnant while the subject is enrolled in the study. Pregnancy will not be considered an SAE.  Any incidence of pregnancy recorded for a female subject or female partner of a male subject 
should be reported.  To ensure subject safety, each pregnancy must be reported to the sponsor or 
its designee within 2 weeks of learning of its occurrence using a clinical trial pregnancy report form.   A Pregnancy Report Form should be completed and submitted by e mail and/or fax to the 
sponsor or its designee.    
Every effort should be made to gather information regarding the pregnancy outcome until 8 weeks post- partum.  It is the responsibility of the investigator to obtain all pregnancy related 
information.  
Pregnancy complications must be reported as an AE or SAE in addition to spontaneous abortions must be reported as an SAE. 
Any SAE occurring in association with a pregnancy brought to the i nvestigator’s attention after 
the subject has completed the study and considered by the i nvestigator as possibly related to the 
study treatment, must be promptly reported to the s ponsor .

 9. CONCOMITANT MEDICATIONS  
Documentation of  all concomitant medication administered during study treatment will be 
recorded in the eCRF at each visit.  
Because there is a potential for interaction of tazemetostat with other concomitantly administered 
drugs through the cytochrome P450 system, over- the-counter medications, or alternative 
therapies must be recorded in the eCRF.  The investigator  should be alerted if the subject is 
taking any agent known to affect or with the potential to affect selected CYP450 isoenzymes.

 10. WITHDRAWAL AND REPLACEMENT OF SUBJECTS  
10.1. Withdrawal from Treatment  
The investigator or sponsor may withdraw the subject at any time in the interest of subject safety. 
Additionally, a subject is free to withdraw from treatment at any time for any reason without 
prejudice to future medical care by the physician or at the institution. When the subject withdraws from treatment, the reason for the withdrawal and date of last dose of tazemetostat (as well as the total treatment period) must be recorded in the eCRF and source documents.  Similarly, if a subject has died on study, the cause and date of death must be report ed as well.  
10.1.1 Withdrawal of Subjects from Study  
Withdrawal of full consent for a study means that the subjects does not wish to receive further protocol -required treatment or procedures and does not wish to or is unable to continue further 
study participatio n.  Subject data up to withdrawal of consent will be included in the analysis of 
the study, and where permitted, publicly available data can be included after withdrawal of consent (e.g., death records).  The investigator must document this agreement regarding withdrawal of full consent as well as discuss appropriate procedures for withdrawal from the study.    
Reasons for removal of a subject from the study might include the following: 
• Death  
• Decision by sponsor to terminate the study  
• Subject request to withdraw from study 
• Lost to follow -up 
10.2. Survival Follow- Up 
Subjects who permanently discontinue study treatment will be followed (by phone, email , or 
clinic visit) for survival every 1 2 weeks until death, withdrawal of consent, or lost to follow -up.  
Subject s will be followed for up to 2 years . 
Subjects who are continuing on study treatment and have received 6 months of treatment on the current study will be followed and treated on Study EZH -501.

 10.3. Subsequent Therapy After Discontinuation of Study Treatment  
Once a subject has permanently discontinued study treatment, every effort should be made to 
have the subject complete the post -treatment follow -up visit prior to initiating any subsequent 
anti-cancer therapy (approved or investigational).   Post -study anti- cancer therapy will not be 
provided as part of this study. The subject may receive subsequent anti- cancer therapy at the 
discretion of the treating physician.  The subsequent anti -cancer therapy should be documented 
on the eCRF. 
10.4. Evaluation of Response to Sub sequent Anti -Cancer Therapy  
To identify a potential epigenetic priming effect of tazemetostat, subjects who are withdrawn 
from this study due to disease progression and who go on to receive subsequent induction therapy should be followed for response whenever possible.  Data to be recorded on the subsequent regimen should include agents received, best response, and duration of response (DOR). 
10.5. Replacement  of Subjects  
For both parts of the study, s ubjects who require a dose reduction of tazemetostat duri ng the first 
19 days of treatment will be replaced.  Subjects who miss 2 or more consecutive tazemetostat 
doses during the first 19 days of treatment or miss more than 3 tazemetostat doses during the first 19 days of treatment may be replaced.   Subjects who miss 2 or more PK blood sample 
collections may be replaced .

 11. SAFETY 
11.1. Safety Monitoring  
11.2. Adverse Event Definition  
11.2.1 Adverse Events  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject 
administered a medicinal product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of an IP , whether or not related to the IP.  
Worsening of a pre- treatment event, after initiation of tazemetostat, must be recorded as a new 
AE.  For example, if a subject experiences mild intermittent dyspepsia prior to dosing 
tazemetostat, but the dyspepsia becomes severe and more frequent after the first dose of tazemetostat, a new AE of severe worsening dyspepsia (with the appropriate date of onset) should be recorded in the eCRF. 
“Lack of efficacy” or “failure of an expected pharmacological action” per se  is not to be reported 
as an AE or SAE.   However, any signs and symptoms and/or clinical sequelae resulting from 
“lack of efficacy” will be reported as an AE or SAE, if they fulfill the definition of an AE or 
SAE.  
Events that do not  meet the definition of an AE include: 
• Medical or surgical procedure (e.g., endoscopy, appendectomy); the condition that leads 
to the procedure is an AE. 
• Situations where an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or convenience admission to a hospital).  
• Anticipated day -to-day fluctuations of pre- existing disease(s) or condition(s) present or 
detected at the start of the study that do not worsen.  
• The disease/disorder being studied, or signs  or symptoms of the disease/disorder being 
studied, unless more severe than expected for t he subject’s condition.  
11.2.2 Serious Adverse Events  
An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose:  
a. Results in death

Amendment 4.0  
  
 
   
Epizyme, Inc . Page 82 of 116 
Confidential  28 September 2018 
 
 b. Is life -threatening 
NOTE:   The term 'life -threatening' in the definition of 'serious' refers to an event in 
which the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event.   It does not refer to an 
event, which hypothetically might have caused death, if it were more severe.  
c. Requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  
NOTE:   In general, hospitalization signifies that the subject has been detained (usually 
involving at least an overnight stay) at the hospital or emergency ward for observation 
and/or treatment that would not have been appropriate in the physician’s office or 
out-patient setting. Complications tha t occur during hospitalization are AEs. If a 
complication prolongs hospitalization or fulfills any other serious criteria, the event is 
serious.   When in doubt as to whether “hospitalization” occurred or was necessary, the 
AE should be considered serious. 
Hospitalization for elective treatment of a pre -existing condition that did not worsen from 
baseline is not considered an AE. 
d. Results in disability/incapacity, or  
NOTE:   The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to 
conduct no rmal life functions.   This definition is not intended to include experiences of 
relatively minor medical significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, 
diarrhea, influenza, and accidental trauma (e.g., sprained ankle) which may interfere or  
prevent everyday life functions but do not constitute a substantial disruption.  
e. Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether reporting is appropriate 
in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be immediately life -
threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the subject or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the above definition. These shoul d also be considered serious. Examples of such events are intensive 
treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsions (in subjects without pre- existing seizure disorder) that do not result in 
hospitalization, or development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 
11.3. Laboratory Abnormalities 
A clinical laboratory AE is any laboratory value that is considered clinically significant by the 
investigator  and has caused a medical intervention or is accompanied by clinical  symptoms.  
Laboratory abnormalities that have not required medical intervention should not be recorded as 
tazemetostat  Protocol Number EZH -105 
Amendment 4.0  
  
 
   
Epizyme, Inc . Page 83 of 116 
Confidential  28 September 2018 
 
 AEs and will be captured and reported in the l aboratory section of the clinical study report 
(CSR).   If a medical intervention occurs, it should be r ecorded as a treatment with the abnormal 
laboratory finding as the AE (e.g., anemia with treatment required and blood transfusion 
recorded as a procedure, hyperglycemia with treatment required and change in insulin dose recorded on concomitant medications). 
The investigator  should decide, based upon the AE criteria and the clinical condition of the 
patient, whether a change in a laboratory parameter is clinically significant and therefore 
represents an AE.  
If, at the end of the treatment phase with the study drug, there are pathological laboratory values which were not present at baseline, further clinical or laboratory investigations should be performed until the values return to within reference range or until a plausible explanation (i.e., concomitant disease) is found for the pathological laboratory values. 
11.4. Other Safety Assessment Abnormalities  
Other  safety assessments (e.g., ECGs, radiological scans, vital signs measurements), including 
those that worsen from baseline and events
 in the medical and scientific judgment of the 
investigator are considered to be clinically significant, are to be recorded as an AE or SAE, in 
accordance with the definitions provided in Sections 11.2.1 and  11.2.2, respectively.    
Any other safety assessment that led to an intervention, including permanent discontinuation of study treatment, dose reduction, and/or dose interruption/delay is also to be recorded as an AE or SAE.    
Events that meet the criteria for serious but are thought to be associated with progression of disease under study should be reported as SAEs but will not typically processed as an expedited report to regulatory authorities.  
NOT E: Disease progression per se should not be reported as an SAE. 
11.5. Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESIs)  
11.5.1 T-LBL/T- ALL  
Lymphoblastic lymphomas are considered thymus derived malignancies that have not yet 
completed T -cell maturations. Approximately 90% of lymphoblastic lymphomas are the T -cell 
phenotype and typically occur in young adults and adolescents, accounting for 29% of pediatric 
and 2% of adult NHL with a median age at diagnosis of 25 years ( Lai, 2013 ; Cortelazzo, 2017 ; 
tazemetostat  Protocol Number EZH -105 
Amendment 4.0

 Lones, 2007 ). T-LBL is morpho logically and immunophenotypically indistinct from T- ALL, with 
both diseases arising from precursor lymphoid cells of the T -cell lineage ( Portell, 2012; Patel, 
2014). Despite the similarities of the two diseases, significant yet unknown characteristics lea d to 
differences in clinical presentations ( Burkhardt, 2009 ). Initial clinical manifestation of both adult 
and pediatric T -LBL includes a mediastinal mass or lymphadenopathy with <25% bone marrow 
blasts. Adult T -LBL patients tend to have less thymic disease and greater lymph node disease and 
bone marrow involvement (Baleydier, 2008;  Swerdlow, 2008 ; Campo, 2011). In contrast, T -ALL 
cases predominantly present with bone marrow and peripheral blood disease, and >25% bone 
marrow blasts ( Swerdlow, 2008; Campo, 2011 ). 
On 06 April 2018 an event of T-LBL was observed in a subject on study EZH-102. This event was reported to regulatory authorities as a 7-day SUSAR on 13 April 2018 (Case number 
2018USEPZ64380299).  
Following this report, Epizyme  conducted a comprehensive evaluation, including: 
 
• Review of literature and available preclinical/clinical data to better understand event of 
T-LBL.   
• Review of the literature and available preclinical/clinical data to better understand the risk of MDS/AML and myeloid malignancies, and other solid tumor malignancies.  
• Assessment of safety, pharmacokinetics (PK) at various doses tested, benefit- risk across 
tumor types in adults and children. 
• Consultation with well recognized external experts in T -cell lymphoma and 
pediatr ic/adult oncology.  
Based on this evaluation, we continue to believe that tazemetostat is a clinically active drug and has the potential to benefit both adult and pediatric patients across different tumor types where 
there are unmet medical needs.   We also  conclude that the risk assessment identifies a possible 
direct association between tazemetostat and T -LBL/T -ALL. Epizyme considers the risk for T-
LBL/T -ALL in tazemetostat clinical trials to be largely concentrated in pediatric patients based 
on 1) higher AUC
0-24h exposures in pediatric patients and 2) increases over time in age- related 
thymic involution, and 3) the known epidemiology / pathophysiology of T- LBL/ALL. The risk 
of T-LBL/T -ALL in adults is not known, however the incidence of treatment- related T-LBL/T -
ALL in adults is expected to be uncommon. To date, over 702 adults have been treated with 
tazemetostat with no observed cased of T -LBL/ALL.

 The event of T -LBL in a 9 -year-old (at the time of enrollment) female subject diagnosed with 
poorly differentiated chordoma occurred on Study Day 432 of treatment with tazemetostat 900 
mg/m2 BID. At the time of the event of T -LBL, the subject was in complete response of her 
target lesions of the disease under study, yet due to presence of 1 of 2 non- target lesion in her 
lung (1 lesion disappeared), was considered overall as a partial responder. The first response was 
observed and measured at Day 54 on treatment. The steady- state AUC 0-24h at Cycle 1 Day 15 in 
this subject was 18,784 ng•h/mL and is simi lar to the mean AUC 0-24h at Cycle 1 Day 15 for the 
900 mg/m2 dose group overall (21,000 ng•h/mL, n=5). The study medication was discontinued 
and the subject withdrawn from the study due to the event. 
 
Induction therapy was initiated on 06 April 2018 with the following regimen: cytrarabine, 
daunorubicin, dexamethasone, dexrazoxane. Methotrexate was subsequently started on 13 April 2018. The 9- year-old subject has since experienced a partial clinical response following standard 
induction chemotherapy, and is expected to have a good overall prognosis as is typical of T- LBL 
in children when treated appropriately.  
The SUSAR of T -LBL resulted in the Sponsor initiating a temporary global halt in enrollment 
for the pediatric study EZH-102. In addition, this event l ed to a partial clinical hold (PCH) on 
new subject enrollment for tazemetostat by the U.S. (FDA), France (ANSM), and Germany 
(BfArM) across all studies of the Tazemetostat Development Program. For further details, see the Investigator’s Brochure, version 8 .0. In the event of suspicion of T- LBL/T -ALL or related 
concerns, please refer to Section 7.3 for evaluation and dose adjustments.   
Heightened surveillance will b e conducted to monitor and identify early signs and symptoms 
(per local practice/standard of care) of T -LBL/T -ALL so that tazemetostat may be discontinued 
in the subject and treatment can be initiated for these malignancies. If a case of adult T -LBL/T -
ALL occurs enrollment will be suspended and the benefit-risk of the drug will be assessed by the 
Tazemetostat Safety Committee and will be communicated to all Health Authorities and Ethics Committees.  
11.5.2 MDS/AML/MPN  
As of the May 01 2018 data cut, 3 cases of MDS/AML/MPN have been reported. One case of 
MDS/MPN was in a subject with follicular lymphoma receiving 800 mg BID in the E7438-G000-101 study. The second case of MDS was reported in the EZH-501 rollover study in a subject with DLBCL treated with 800 mg BI D tazemetostat. A third case, a non -serious AE of 
myelofibrosis was reported in a subject with follicular lymphoma receiving 800 mg BID 
Tazemetostat in E7438-G000-101.  For all three cases, the causality assessment was confounded 
by the subject’s prior tre atment history or the presence of the disease before starting

 tazemetostat. A summary of these 3 cases please refer to the Investigator’s Brochure, Version 
8.0. In the event of suspicion of these malignancies or related concerns, please refer to Section 
6.5 for evaluation and dose adjustments.  Heightened surveillance  will be conducted to monitor 
and identify early signs and symptoms (per local practice/standard of care) of any MDS/AML and other myeloid malignancies like MPN.  For any MDS/AML or other myeloid malignancies 
like MPN, tazemetostat will be held, and after discussion with the Investigator, tazemetostat will 
be modified or discontinued. All AESIs are to be reported on the eCRF whether or not they meet the criteria for  an SAE.  
11.5.3 Other Identified Risks  
• AEs considered related to abnormal bone formation and confirmed by a radiologic 
scan.  
• AEs associated with treatment overdose, misuse, abuse, or medication error; and any 
treatment -emergent significant laboratory abnormality .  
11.5.4 Tazemetostat Safety Committee  
A safety monitoring committee  composed  of internal and external medical experts will review 
all AESI  cases, including T-LBL/ALL, MDS/AML and other myeloid malignancies like MPN 
(both related and unrelated), and other solid tumor malignancies. Cases  will be evaluated for 
suspected relationship to  tazemetostat  and adjudicated by the experts. Recommendations for next 
steps per the risk management plan will be communicated to the CMO.  
11.6. Grading and Severity  
The severity of all A Es and SAEs, including appropriate laboratory values, will be graded 
utilizing the NCI CTCAE Version 4.03.  The link to the NCI CTCAE Version 4.03 is: 
http://evs.nci.nih.gov/ftp1/CTCAE/CTCAE_4.03_2010-06-14_QuickReference_8.5x11.pdf  
In the event that an AE is not covered by the CTCAE, the assessment of severity will be 
determined by using the CTCAE general guideline:

 Grade 1: Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; 
intervention not indicated.  
Grade 2:  Moderate; minimal, local , or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age -
appropriate instrumental ADLa 
Grade 3:  Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; hospitalization 
or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; limiting self -care ADLb 
Grade 4:  Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated . 
Grade 5:  Death related to AE . 
ADL = Activities of Daily  Living; AE = adverse event  
a. Instrumental ADL refer to preparing meals, shopping for groceries or clothes, using the telephone, 
managing money, etc.  
b. Self-care ADL refer to bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, taking medications,  
and not bedridden.  
 
An AE that is assessed as severe should not be confused with an SAE.  Severity is a category 
used for rating the intensity of an event (as in ‘mild’, ‘moderate’, or ‘severe’); both AEs and SAEs can be assessed as severe.   An event is described as ‘serious’ when it meets one of the pre-
defined outcomes as described in Section 11.2.2 which are based on patient/event outcome or action criteria associated with events that pose a threat to a subject’s life or functioning  
11.7. Relationship Categorization 
A qualified investigator  must make the determination of relationship to tazemetostat for each AE 
or SAE.   The investigator  should decide whether, in his or her medical judgment there is a 
reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by tazemetostat.    
11.7.1 Assessing Relationship to Study Treatment  
The following should be considered when assessing the relationship of an AE to study treat ment:  
• Temporal relationship of the onset of the event to the first dose of tazemetostat  
• The course of the event, considering especially the effect of discontinuation of study 
treatment or the reintroduction of study treatment, as applicable  
• Whether the event is known to be associated with the study treatment or with other similar treatments  
• The presence of risk factors in the study subject known to increase the occurrence of 
the event  
• The presence of non -study treatment -related factors that are known to be associated 
with the occurrence of the event.

Amendment 4.0  
  
 
   
Epizyme, Inc . Page 88 of 116 
Confidential  28 September 2018 
 
 The relationship of an AE to study treatment is to be classified as follows: 
• Not Related:  A causal relationship between tazemetostat and the AE is not a 
reasonable possibility. 
• Related:   A causal relationship between tazemetostat and the AE is a reasonable 
possibility (includes probably, possibly, and definitely related).    
If the causal relationship between an AE/SAE and tazemetostat is related, that determination will 
be used for purposes of expedited regulator y reporting. 
11.8. Outcome Categorization  
Outcome of an AE/SAE may be classified as resolved, resolved with sequelae, unresolved, or  
death. 
All treatment- related AEs/SAEs will be followed to resolution (the subject’s health has returned 
to his/her baseline status or all variables have returned to normal), or until an outcome is reached, 
stabilization occurs (the investigator  does not expect an y further improvement or worsening of 
the event), or the event is otherwise explained, regardless of whether the subject is still participating in the study.   Where appropriate, medical tests and examinations will be performed 
to document resolution of the  event(s).  
11.9. Timeframe for Reporting AEs and SAEs  
AEs: AEs will be collected from the time the first dose of study treatment is administered until 
the earlier of either 30 days after the discontinuation of study treatment or until the initiation of subsequen t anti -cancer therapy.  
SAEs: SAEs will be collected over the same time period as stated above for AEs.   In addition, 
any SAE assessed as related  to study participation (e.g., protocol-mandated procedures, invasive 
tests, or change in existing therapy), study treatment must be recorded from the time a subject 
provides consent to participate in the study up to and including any follow-up contact. All SAEs will be reported to the sponsor  within 24 hours.   
After discontinuation of study treatment :  The invest igator will monitor all ongoing 
AEs/SAEs until resolution or stabilization of the event or until the subject is lost to follow -up.  
Up until 30 days after the last dose of study treatment or until the initiation of subsequent anti-cancer therapy, whichever  is earlier, the investigator  may report any AE that they consider to be 
possibly related to study treatment.

 11.10. Reporting of SAEs 
All SAEs will be reported within 24 hours of the investigator  becoming aware of the event.   The 
investigator  must promptly not ify the sponsor  or its designee of all SAEs in order that the legal 
obligations and ethical responsibilities of the sponsor  or its designee are met.  
The sponsor  has a legal responsibility to notify both the local regulatory authority and other 
regulatory agencies about the safety of the IP under clinical investigation.   The sponsor  and its 
designee will comply with country specific regulatory requirements relatin g to safety reporting to 
the regulatory authority, IRB/EC /CEC  and investigators. 
Any AE that is both unexpected (not consistent with the applicable product information) and also 
meets the definition of a suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction (SUSAR ). All SUSARs 
will be reported within 24 hours of the investigator  becoming aware of the event.   Investigator  
safety reports are prepared for SUSARs according to local regulatory requirements and the 
sponsor  policy and are forwarded to investigator s as necessary.   The sponsor  is legally obligated 
to report the event to the regulatory a uthorities within 7  days for fatal or life -threatening 
SUSARs or 15 days for all other SUSARs. 
An investigator who receives an investigator safety report describing a SAE(s) o r other specific 
safety information (e.g., summary or listing of SAEs) from the sponsor  will file it with the IB 
and will notify the IRB/EC /CEC , if appropriate according to local requirements. 
11.10.1 Regulatory Authorities, IRB/EC, and Central Ethics Committees (CEC)  
The sponsor  or its designee is responsible for notifying the investigational sites of all expedited 
SAEs.   The sponsor  or designee shall also notify CEC of new serious, related, and unexpected 
AE(s) or significant risks to subjects, per country requi rements.  
The investigator  will notify the IRB/EC /CEC  of serious, related, and unexpected AE(s) or 
significant risks to subjects, per local country requirements.  The investigator  must keep copies 
of all AE information, including correspondence with the spo nsor or local IRB/EC /CEC s on file.  
It is the responsibility of the Principal investigator  to notify the IRB/EC of all SAEs that occur at 
his/her site.   Investigator s will be notified of all suspected, unexpected SAEs (7/15- Day Safety 
Reports) that occur during any clinical studies that are using the investigative compound.   Each 
site is responsible for notifying their IRB/EC /CEC  of these additional SAEs.

 12. DATA MANAGEMENT  
Data from eCRFs and other external data will be entered into an Electronic Data Capture clinical 
database.   These data will be electronically verified through the use of real- time checks 
processed during data entry, and through programmed edit checks as specified in the data management plan.  Discrepancies in the data will be brought to the attention of the clinic al team 
and investigational site personnel, if necessary, in the form of an electronic data query.   
Resolutions to these issues will be reflected in the database and an audit trial within the system will track all queries and changes made to the data.   Quality control audit(s) will be performed.  
12.1. Coding  
Concomitant medications will be assigned a code using the version of the World Health Organization (WHO) dictionary (version June 2015 or higher) drug codes specified in the data management plan (version June 2015 or higher).  Concomitant medications will be further coded to the appropriate Anatomical -Therapeutic- Chemical (ATC) code indicating therapeutic 
classification.   A listing of concomitant medications by drug and drug class will be included in 
the CS R for this protocol.  
AEs will be classified into standardized terminology from the verbatim description (investigator  
term) according to the version of the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities ( MedDRA ) 
coding dictionary (version 18.0, or higher) specified in the data management plan. AEs will be presented by p referred term nested within System Organ Class (SOC).  Verbatim description and 
preferred term  and SOC MedDRA- level terms for all AEs will be contained in the data listings of 
the CSR for this study.

 13. STATISTICAL METHODS  
13.1. Hypotheses  
Results of this study will be descriptive and no hypothesis will be tested.  
13.2. Study Design Considerations  
13.2.1 Determination of Sample Size  
The sample size was determined based on feasibility considerations.   A total of 12 su bjects per 
part is adequate to describe the effect of CYP3A inhibition on the PK  of tazemetostat, the effect 
of tazemetostat on the PK of repaglinide and omeprazole, and the effect of medications that 
increase gastric pH on tazemetostat PK. 
This study will provide a point estimate and associated 90% confidence intervals on the 
magnitude of the effect of the perpetrator drugs on the PK of the victim drugs.  The default no effect boundary of 80 – 125% for the 90% confidence interval for an effect size will be used as a reference. This is equivalent to a hypothesis test with a null hypothesis that there is a nonzero effect and alternative of no effect.   If the 90% confidence interval for any effect tested in this 
study falls completely within 80 – 125%, it will be concluded that no clinically significant differences are present.   The operating characteristics of this hypothesis test depend on the 
underlying within- subject correlation of subsequent measurements of the same PK parameter. If 
subsequent measurements  of tazemetostat AUC have a correlation of at least 0.885, this test is 
powered at 80% or higher (results from simulation assuming standard deviation of log AUC = 0.5149 from the pilot study). Assuming the null hypothesis of this test is assumed to be >±5% effect, the simulated alpha level is 0.006. 
The precision in the confidence limits is difficult to succinctly characterize given the unknown 
intra-subject variability and the exponential transformation. The corresponding hypothesis test to 
the 90% CI has at least 93% power for the alternative of doubling (or halving) of the tazemetostat AUC, assuming within -subject correlation of at least 0.8.  
13.2.2 Sample Size Re-Estimation 
The sample size will not be re -estimated during this study.

 13.3. Data Analysis Considerations 
13.3.1 Analysis Populations 
The Intent -to-Treat (ITT)  population will consist of all subjects  who receive at least one dose 
of tazemetostat.  The ITT population will be used for summaries and analys es of the efficacy 
endpoints. 
The Safety population  will consist of all subjects in the ITT  population who receive at least one 
dose of IP and have at least one postdose  safety observation recorded. The Safety population will 
be used for summaries and analys es of the safety and tolerability.  
The Pharmacoki netic (PK) population will include all subjects in the ITT population who have 
sufficient postdose  samples collected to allow estimation of the PK parameters.  The PK 
population will be used for PK  summaries and analys es. 
The Pharmaco geno mic (PGx) population will include all subjects in the PK population from 
whom PGx results are available. The P Gx population will be used for summary of PK 
parameters by presence or absence of polymorphic genetic markers. 
13.3.2 Interim Analyses  
Interim analyses will not be performed.   
13.3.3 Key Elements of the Analysis Plan 
The statistical analyses will be performed on log -transformed PK parameters.  The log -
transformed PK parameters will be analyzed by an analysis of variance (ANOVA).  The ANOVA 
will use a mixed -effects model w ith treatment as a fixed effect and subject as a random effect. 
The anti -logs of the confidence limits of the 90% CI for the difference in the treatment means of 
the log -transformed data are a 90% CI for the ratio of geometric means between the test and 
reference treatment.  The geometric least squares (adjusted) mean and associated 90% CI for the

 13.3.3.1. Part A  
Descr iptive statistics will be calculated.  Plasma concentrations of tazemetostat and its 
metabolites will be listed for each subject and summarized by treatment (tazemetostat alone and 
tazemetostat plus fluconazole) and time point.  PK parameters will be listed for each subject and 
summarized by treatment (tazemetostat alone and tazemetostat plus fluconazole).  Plasma 
concentrations of fluconazole will be listed for each subject and summarized by time point. PK parameters for fluconazole will be listed for each su bject and summarized.  
To evaluate the effect of fluconazole on the PK of tazemetostat, a 90% CI for the ratio of 
adjusted geometric means for the test treatment to the reference treatment for   tazemetostat C
max 
and AUC will be calculated.  Tazemetostat admi nistered without fluconazole will be considered 
the reference treatment and tazemetostat administered in combination with fluconazole will be considered the test treatment.   
13.3.3.2. Part B  
Descriptive statistics will be calculated.  Plasma concentrations of repagli nide and its metabolites, 
omeprazole, 5 -OH-omeprazole, and omeprazole sulfone will be listed for each subject and 
summarized by treatment (repaglinide and omeprazole; repaglinide and omeprazole plus steady -
state tazemetostat) and time point.  PK parameters will be listed for each subject and summarized 
by treatment (repaglinide and omeprazole; repaglinide and omeprazole plus steady -state 
tazemetostat).  Plasma concentrations of tazemetostat will be listed for each subject and 
summarized by day (Day 16 and Day 19) and time point. PK parameters for tazemetostat will be listed for each subject and summarized  by treatment (tazemetostat administered 1 h before 
repaglinide and omeprazole and tazemetostat administered after 4 days of omeprazole administration) .

 omeprazole on Day 16 will be considered the reference treatment.  Tazemetostat administered 
after 4 days of omeprazole administration (Day 19) will be considered the test treatment 
13.4. Pharmacogenomic Analyses  (PGx)  
Subjects who consent to PGx  research will be genotyped for polymorphisms on genes for CYP 
enzymes.  PGx  parameters will be summarized by treatment and the presence or absence of 
polymorphic genetic markers. 13.5. Efficacy Analyses 
Overall response rate  is defined as the percentage of subjects achieving a CR or PR from the start 
of treatment until disease progression or the start of subsequent anti- cancer therapy, as per  
Lugano Classification [ Cheson 2014
] for subjects with lymphoma or RECIST v1.1 [Eisenhauer] 
for subjects with solid tumors. Subjects evaluated with RECIST require confirmation of CR or 
PR at least 28 days from the initial response assessment. Subjects with an unknown or missing 
response will be treated as non -responders, i.e., they will be included in the denomina tor when 
calculating the percentage.  An exact 90% CI  for the overall response rate will be provided.  
Respons e duration, for the subset of subjects with CR or PR response, is defined as the interval 
of time from the first documented evidence of CR or PR until the first documented disease 
progression or death due to any cause, using disease- appropriate standardized response criteria.  
The duration of response ( DOR ) will be calculated for each subject with a  CR or PR (lymphoma) 
or confirmed CR or PR  (solid tumors) . A listing of DOR will be provided. 
Disease control rate (DCR) is defined as the percentage of subjects achieving CR  or PR, or SD 
lasting 24 weeks  since start of treatment until disease progression or the start of subsequent anti-
cancer therapy . The DCR will be summarized in a similar manner as overall response rate and 
duration.  
Overall survival ( OS) is defined as the interval of time between the date of the first dose of 
tazemetostat and the date of death due to any cause.  For subjects surviving a t the time of the OS 
analysis, the time of death will be censored at the date of last contact.  OS will be calculated using 
the Kaplan -Meier method. If there are a sufficient number of deaths at the time of the analysis, 
median OS, first and third quartiles, and 90% CI (Brookmeyer- Crowley method) will be 
summarized. A figure and listing of OS will also be provided.

 Summaries will be presented by study part and overall. Data on disease status in subjects 
enroll ed in this study will be listed . 
13.6. Safety Analyses 
13.6.1 Extent of Exposure 
The data on exposure to tazemetostat will be listed.  Details pertaining to dose interruption or 
dose modification will also be listed.  
13.6.2 Adverse Events  
The data listings of AEs in the C SR will contain the verbatim description, preferred t erm, and 
SOC MedDRA- level terms.  
Treatment -emergent AEs (TEAEs) are defined by applying treatment -emergent signs and 
symptoms (TESS) philosophy. AEs will be regarded as TEAEs if one of the following conditions is met:  
• Emerge after the time of first dose ad ministration, having been absent prior to the first 
dose. 
• Re-emerge, having been present but stopped prior to the time of first dose administration. 
• Worsen in severity after the time of first dose administration relative to the pre -treatment 
state, when the AE is continuous. 
An AE with partial or completely missing start date and/or time will always be assumed as TEAE, unless it can be determined to be “prior to administration” from the incomplete start date/time or resolution date/time (e.g., month, year is before first administration date, or resolution date is before first administration date).  
Only TEAEs will be summarized. Summaries of TEAEs will consist of the number and percentage of subjects reporting the AE by SOC and by preferred term . TEAEs which occur 
more than once for a subject will be counted only once in the subject frequencies. TEAEs with 
different CTCAE grades for a subject will be counted at the worst (highest) grade for the same SOC (likewise for preferred term ). TEAEs with different drug relationship for a subject will be 
counted at strongest relationship for the same SOC (likewise for preferred term ). TEAEs with 
missing relationship to study treatment will be counted as “related”.  TEAEs with missing 
CTCAE grade will be counted as Grade 3 (“severe”).

 Summaries of TEAEs by study part and overall will be produced to present the number and 
percentage of subjects with : 
• Any TEAE  
• Any treatment -related TEAE  
• Any TEAE with NCI CTCAE Grade 3 or higher 
• Any TEAE leading to study treatment discontinuation 
• Any Serious TEAEs  
• Any TEAE of special interest  
Listings will be provided for the following: 
• AEs 
• TEAEs leading to study treatment discontinuation  
• Serious TEAEs  
• Fatal TEAEs  
• TEAEs of special interest  
13.6.3 Clinical Laboratory Evaluation 
All clinical laboratory parameters will be standardized according to the International System of Units (SI) prior to summarization.  Separate listings and summary tables (by study part and 
overall) will be produced for each laboratory test group (complete blood counts, serum chemistries (liver, renal [with creatinine clearance, if creatinine is abnormal] and metabolism), coagulation profile, and urinalysis). 
Complete blood counts, serum chemistries and coagulation will be summarized at each planned 
visit assessment, and  for change from baseline using descriptive statistics (mean, S TD, median, 
minimum , and maximum).  Categorical values will be summarized using number of observations 
and percentages (urinalysis assessment). 
Low, normal, and high (LNH) classifications will be applied to determine whether the laboratory 
test value was below (L), within (N), or above (H) its reference range. Shifts from baseline in LNH classification and clinically significant findings for each parameter will be summarized by study part and overall at each planned post- baseline visit. The summary will include the worst-
case shift from baseline during the post-baseline period, which will include both planned (scheduled) and unscheduled visits after the first dose of study drug. Subjects with labo ratory 
data outside the normal range will be flagged as “L” (Low) or “H” (High) in the data listing.

 The worst -case shift from baseline in terms of the clinically significant findings in each 
laboratory test group will be summarized separately.  
Unless othe rwise specified, the denominator in percentage calculation at each visit will be based 
on the number of subjects with non- missing value at the specified visit. 
13.6.4 Other Safety Measures  
The results of scheduled assessments of physical examination, vital signs,  ECG, and ECOG 
performance status will be summarized by study part and overall.  Summaries will include data 
from scheduled visits. Shifts from baseline will be summarized where appropriate.  All data will 
be listed.  
13.7. Pharmacokinetic Analyses  
Plasma concentrations of all analytes will be determined by validated bioanalytical methods.  
Plasma concentrations of all analytes will be listed for each subject and summarized by study 
part, treatment, day, and nominal time. Standard summary statistics w ill be calculated 
(i.e., arithmetic mean, S TD, median, minimum, and maximum) for each endpoint.    
13.7.1 Plasma Pharmacokinetics   
All PK parameters will be calculated with noncompartmental methods using actual times.  The 
following PK parameters will be determined  as data permit:

14.2. Regulatory and Ethical Considerations 
The procedures set out in this study protocol, pertaining to the conduct, evaluation, and documentation of this study, are designed to ensure that the sponsor  and investigator s abide by 
GCP as described in the I CH Tripartite Guideline E6 (R1): GCP: Consolidated Guideline, and 
for US Investigators, 21 C FR Parts 50, 54, 56, and 312. Compliance with these regulations also 
constitutes compliance with the ethical principles described in the current revision of the Declaration of Helsinki.  The study will also be carried out in keeping with local legal and 
regulatory requirements. 
It is the investigator ’s responsibility to ensure that adequate time and appropriate resources are 
available at the study site prior to commitment to participate in this study.  The invest igator  
should also be able to estimate or demonstrate a potential for recruiting the required number of 
suitable subjects within the agreed recruitment period. 
The investigator  will maintain a list of appropriately qualified persons to whom the investigato r 
has delegated significant study -related tasks.  An up -to-date copy of the curriculum vitae for the 
investigator , sub- investigator(s) and essential study staff will be provided to the sponsor  or its 
designee before starting the study.  
If the subject has a primary physician the investigator  should, with the subject’s or his/her legal 
representative’s consent, inform them of the subject’s participation in the study.  
14.2.1 Institutional Review Board (IRB)/ Ethics Committee (EC)/ Central Ethics 
Committee ( CEC) 
It is the responsibility of the investigator to submit this protocol, the informed consent document 
(approved by the sponsor or its designate), relevant supporting information and all types of 
subject recruitment information to the IRB/EC for review.  All must be approved prior to site

 On the IRB/EC approval letter, the study reference, the date of review , and actions  taken should 
be clearly stated.  
Clinical supplies of IP will not be released to the site and recruitment of subjects will not begin 
until the IRB/EC written approval has been received by the s ponsor or its designee. 
The investigator is responsible for kee ping the IRB/EC apprised of the progress of the study and 
of any changes made to the protocol and/or ICF. The investigator must also keep the IRB/EC 
informed of  any serious and significant AE s. 
14.2.2 Informed Consent Process  
It is the responsibility of the investigator to obtain written informed consent from each subject 
before any protocol -specific assessments and/or procedures are performed.  All consent 
documentation must be in accordance with applicable regulations and GCP. Each subject or the 
subject’s legall y authorized representative is requested to sign the ICF after the subject has 
received and read the written subject information and received an explanation of what the study involves, including but not limited to: the objectives, potential benefits and risk, inconveniences, and the subject’s rights and responsibilities. A copy of the ICF (subject information sheet and the ICF, as applicable) must be given to the subject or the subject’s legally authorized representative.  
If applicable, it will be provided in a certified translation of the subject’s local language.  Signed 
ICFs must remain in each subject’s study file and must be available for verification by study monitors at any time.  
Each investigator will provide the sponsor or its designee with a copy of  the IRB/EC approved 
ICF(s), and a copy of the IRB/EC written approval, prior to the start of the study. Additionally, if the IRB/EC requires modification of the sample subject information and the model ICF provided by the sponsor, the documentation supporting this requirement must be provided to the sponsor. 
14.3. Subject Confidentiality and Access to Source Documents/Data  
Subject confidentiality is strictly held in trust by the sponsor  and/or their designee(s), 
participating investigators, and any staff. This c onfidentiality includes the clinical information 
relating to participating subjects, as well as any genetic or biological testing.  
The study protocol, documentation, data, and all other information generated will be held in strict confidence. No informatio n concerning the study or the data will be released to any 
unauthorized third party without prior written approval of the sponsor .

 The study monitor or other authorized representatives of the sponsor  may inspect all documents 
and records required to be maintained by the investigator, including but not limited to, medical 
records (office, clinic, or hospital) and pharmacy records for the subjects in this study. The clinical study site will permit access to such records.  
14.4. Study Monitoring  
Monitoring of the study will be performed by the sponsor  or its designee(s).  At the monitoring 
visits, the progress of the study will be discussed with the investigator , or his/her representative. 
The ICFs will be reviewed for signatures and the eCRFs checked for completene ss and accuracy.  
Subject source data must be available for review.  The investigator  and his/her staff are expected 
to cooperate with the study monitor and be available during at least a portion of the monitoring visit to review the eCRFs and any queries/re solutions, answer questions, and provide any 
missing information.  
The study monitor will record the date of each visit together with a summary of the status and progress of the study.  Proposed actions will be confirmed with the investigator  in writing.  
Telephone contact will be made with the investigator  as necessary during the data collection 
period and during the data and report writing periods. 
14.5. Protocol Deviations 
The clinical sites will adopt all reasonable measures to record data in accordance with the 
protocol.  Under practical working conditions, however, some minor variations may occur due to 
circumstances beyond the control of the clinic . All such deviations will be documented in the 
study records, together with the reason for their occurrence; where appropriate, deviations will 
be detailed in the CSR . Investigative sites will contact the medical monitor to request 
clarifications regarding any aspect of the clinical study or eligibility of subjects.  
When an emergency occurs that requires a deviatio n from the protocol for an individual subject, 
the deviation will be only for that subject.  The investigator  or other physician in attendance in 
such an emergency will, if circumstances and time permit, contact the sponsor  or their 
representative(s), immediately by telephone.  Such contacts will be made as soon as possible to 
permit a decision as to whether or not the subject (for whom the protocol deviation was affected) is to continue in the study.  The source documentation will completely describe the prot ocol 
deviation and state the reasons for such deviation.  In addition, the IRB/EC /CEC  will be notified 
in writing of such protocol deviation.

All amendments to the protocol must be documented in writing, reviewed, and approved by the 
investigator  and the sponsor , and submitted to the IRB/EC /CEC  for approval prior to initiation, 
except in cases where required for subject safety.  If the protocol amendment substantially alters 
the study design or potential risk to the subject, a new written I CF for continued participation in 
the study must be obtained from each subject or his/her legal representative.  
14.7. Suspension or Termination of Study  
Should conditions requiring further clarification arise before the decision to proceed with or terminate the study can be reached, the study will be suspended until the situation has been 
resolved.  
The sponsor  has the right to terminate this study and remove all study material from the site at 
any time.  Examples of where this might occur include, but are not limi ted to:  
• When it becomes apparent that subject enrollment is unsatisfactory with respect to 
quality and/or quantity or data recording is inaccurate and/or incomplete on a chronic basis.  
• When the incidence and/or severity of AEs in this study indicates a potential health hazard caused by treatment with tazemetostat.

 15. ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES  
15.1. Recording and Access and to Study Records  
As described in the ICH GCP Guidelines, ‘essential documents’, including eCRFs, source 
documents, consent forms, laboratory test results , and the IP  inventory records, should be 
retained by the investigator until at least 2 years after the last approval of a marketing application 
in an ICH region and until there are no pending or contemplated marketing applications in an 
ICH region or at least 2 years have elapsed since the formal discontinuation of clinical 
development of the IP. These documents should be retained for a longer period however if 
required by the applicable regulatory requirements or by an agreement with the sponsor or its designee. It is the responsibility of the sponsor to inform t he investigator/institution as to when 
these documents no longer need to be retained. The investigator must obtain written permission 
from the sponsor or its designee prior to the destruction of any study document. 
These records must be made available at r easonable times for inspection and duplication, if 
required, by a properly authorized representative of the US FDA in accordance with the US Code 
of Federal Regulations, 21 CFR 312.68, or other regulatory authorities in accordance with regulatory requirements. 
15.2. Case Report Forms  
eCRF s will be used for data collection for this study.  
The investigator  is responsible for maintaining adequate and accurate source documents from 
which accurate information will be transcribed into eCRFs, which have been designed to capture 
all observations and other data pertinent to the clinical investigation.  The eCRFs should be 
completed by the investigator  or delegate as stated on the Delegation of Authority Log. 
Overwriting of information or use of liquid correcting fluid is no t allowed in the source 
document. 
Each investigative site will be visited as frequently as documented in the monitoring plan by the 
sponsor  or their designee to review the eCRFs for completeness and accuracy.  The sponsor  or 
their designee will highlight an y discrepancies found between source documents and the 
completed eCRFs and ensure that appropriate site personnel address the discrepancies.  When a 
discrepancy results in corrected eCRF data, the correction will be reviewed again against the correct source documentation. Uniform procedures will be discussed at the Site Initiation Visit.

Amendment 4.0  
  
 
   
Epizyme, Inc . Page 105 of 116 
Confidential  28 September 2018 
 
 The eCRFs must be reviewed and electronically signed and dated by the investigator  once all 
data has been entered and all queries resolved.  Once the study monitor has verifi ed the contents 
of the completed eCRFs against the source data, queries may be raised if the data are unclear or 
contradictory.  The investigator  must address all queries. 
15.3. Quality Assurance and Quality Control 
A site monitoring plan will be developed to ensure the human subject protection, study procedures, laboratory, study intervention administration, and data collection processes are of high quality and meet the sponsor 's, ICH/GCP, and other applicable regulatory guidelines. 
The investigator  will permit a uthorized the sponsor  or its designee(s) and the respective 
regulatory authorities to inspect facilities and records relevant to this study if needed.  
Initial site training will be provided by the sponsor  or its designee. Training for new site staff 
will b e provided by current study nurs es and study coordinators under the supervision of the 
primary investigator . Additional training will be provided by the sponsor  or its designee as 
needed.  
The designated Data Management Team will implement quality control ( QC) procedures 
beginning with the data entry system and generate data QC checks that will be run on the database.  Any missing data or data anomalies will be communicated to the site(s) for 
clarification/resolution.  
15.4. Data Quality Assurance 
This study will be organized, performed, and reported in compliance with the sponsor  or its 
designee's Standard Operating Procedures, protocols and working practice documents, and the requirements of ICH/GCP guidelines. Compliance will be achieved through a combination of study- specific audits of investigative sites and audits at regular intervals of the sponsor  or its 
designee's systems for data handling, analysis, and reporting.  
15.5. Confidentiality  
Data collected during this study may be used to support the development, registration, or 
marketing of tazemetostat.  After a subject or his/her legal representative have consented to take 
part in the study their medical records and the data collected during the study will be reviewed by the sponsor  and/or its desig nee. These records and data may be reviewed by the following: 
independent auditors who validate the data on behalf of the sponsor;  third parties with whom the

 sponsor  may develop, register , or market tazemetostat; national or local regulatory authorities , 
and the IRB/EC /CEC (s) which gave its/their approval for this study to proceed. 
Although subjects will be known by a unique identifier number, their year of birth will also be 
collected and used to assist the sponsor  and/or its designee to verify the accura cy of the data, for 
example, that the laboratory results are assigned to the correct subject.  
15.6. Audit/Inspection 
To ensure compliance with relevant regulations, data generated by this study will be available for inspection upon request by representatives of the US FDA as well as other national and local regulatory authorities, the sponsor  and/or its designee, interested commercial parties, and the 
IRB/EC/CEC  for each study site.  
15.7. Record Retention  
As applicable, study records will be maintained  a minimum of 5 y ears beyond (1) the publication 
of any abstract or manuscript reporting the results of the protocol; (2) the submission of any sponsored research final report; or (3) submission of a final report to clinicaltrials.gov.  
15.8. Provision of Study Results and Public ation 
A summary of the study results will be made publicly available within 12 months of reaching the end of the study, defined as the date of the last subject’s last visit. A full CSR  will be made 
publicly available no later than 18 months after the end o f the study.  
If a manuscript is published in a peer- reviewed journal, then that initial release may be an 
abstract that meets the requirements of the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors.  
All manuscripts, abstracts or other modes of presentation arising from the results of the study must be reviewed and approved in writing by the sponsor , in advance of submission. The review 
is aimed at protecting the sponsor ’s proprietary information existing either at the date of the 
commencement of the study or generated during the study. 
The detailed obligations regarding the publication of any data, material results , or other 
information, generated or created in relation to the study shall be set out in the agreement 
between each investigator  and the spons or.

 Score 1, 2, or 3 * with or without a residual 
mass on 5PS†  
It is recognized that in Waldeyer’s ring or extranodal  sites with high physiologic uptake 
or with activation within spleen or marrow (eg, with chemotherapy or myeloid colony-stimulating factors), uptake may be greater 
than normal mediastinum and/or liver. In this 
circumstance, complete metabolic response may be inferred if uptake at sites of initial 
involvement is no greater than surrounding normal tissue even if the tissue has high physiologic uptake
 
 Target nodes/nodal masses must regress to < 1.5 cm in LDi  
No extralymphatic sites of disease  
 
Nonmeasured  lesion  Not applicable  
 Absent  
Organ enlargement  Not applicable  
 Regress to normal

Bone marrow  No evidence of FDG -avid disease in 
marrow  Normal by morphology; if indeterminate, IHC negative  
Partial    Partial metabolic response  Partial remission (all of the 
f i)  Lymph nodes and extralymphatic sites
 
 Score 4 or 5† with reduced uptake compared 
with baseline and residual mass(es) of any size 
At interim, these findings suggest responding disease  
 At end of treatment, these findings indicate 
residual disease > 50% decrease in SPD of up to 
6 target measurable nodes and 
extranodal sites  
When a lesion is too small to measure on CT, assign 5 mm x 5 mm 
as the default value  
When no longer visible, 0 x 0 mm  
For a node > 5 mm x 5 mm,  but 
smaller than normal, use actual 
measurement for calculation  
 
Nonmeasured lesions  Not applicable  Absent/normal, regressed, but no increase
 
 
Organ enlargement  Not applicable  Spleen must have regressed by > 
50% in length beyond normal

 Revised Criteria for Response Assessment  
 Response and Site  PET -CT-Based  Response  CT-Based  Response  
Bone marrow  Residual uptake higher than uptake in 
normal marrow but reduced compared with 
baseline (diffuse uptake compatible with 
reactive changes from chemotherapy 
allowed). If there are persistent focal changes in the marrow in the context of a nodal response, cons ideration should be 
given to further evaluation with MRI or biopsy or an interval scan  Not applicable  
No response or stable 
disease  No metabolic response  Stable disease  
Target nodes/nodal 
masses, extranodal 
lesions  Score 4 or 5 with no significant change  in 
FDG uptake from baseline at interim or end of treatment < 50% decrease from baseline in 
SPD of up to 6 dominant, measurable nodes and extranodal 
sites; no criteria for progressive 
disease are met  
Nonmeasured lesions  Not applicable  No increase consistent with 
progression  
Organ enlargement  Not applicable  No increase consistent with 
progression  
New lesions  None  None  
Bone marrow  No change from baseline  Not applicable  
Progressive disease  Progressive metabolic disease  Progressive disease requires at 
least 1 of the following:   
Individual target 
nodes/nodal masses  Score 4 or 5 with an increase in intensity of 
uptake from baseline and/or  PPD progression  
Extranodal lesions  Score 4 or 5 with an increase in intensity of 
uptake from baseline and/o  An individual node/lesion must be 
abnormal with: LDi >  1.5 cm  and 
Increase by > 50% from PPD nadir and  
An increase in LDi or SDi from nadir
 
0.5 cm for lesions ≤ 2 cm  
1.0 cm for lesions > 2 cm  
In the setting  of splenomegaly,  the 
splenic  length  must increase by > 
50% of the extent of its prior increase beyond  baseline  (eg, a 
15-cm spleen must  increase  to > 
16 cm). If no prior splenomegaly, must increase by at least 2 cm 
from baseline

 Revised Criteria for Response Assessment  
 Response and Site  PET -CT-Based  Response  CT-Based  Response  
New lesions  New FDG -avid foci consistent with 
lymphoma rather than another etiology 
(eg, infection, inflammation). If uncertain regarding etiology of new lesions, biopsy 
or interval scan may be considered  
 Regrowth of previously resolved 
lesions  
A new node > 1.5 cm in any axis  
A new extranodal site > 1.0 cm in any axis; if < 1.0 cm in any axis, its 
presence must be unequivocal and must be attributable to lymphoma 
Assessable disease of any size 
unequivocally attributable to 
lymphoma  
 
Bone marrow  New or recurrent FDG -avid foci  New or recurrent involvement  
Abbreviations: 5PS = 5 -point scale; CT = computed tomography; FDG = fluorodeoxyglucose; IHC = 
immunohistochemistry; LDi  = longest transverse diameter of a lesion; MRI = magnetic resonance imaging; 
PET = positron emission tomography; PPD = cross product of the LDi and perpendicular diameter; SDi = shortest axis perpendicular to the LDi; SPD = sum of the product of the perpendicular diameters for multiple lesions.  
 
*A score of 3 in many patients indicates a good prognosis with standard treatment, especially if at the time of an 
interim scan. However, in trials involving PET where de -escalation is investigated, it may be preferable to 
consider a score of 3 as inadequate response (to avoid undertreatment). Measured dominant lesions: Up to 6 of 
the largest dominant nodes, nodal masses, and extranodal lesions selected to be clearly measurable in 2 
diameters. Nodes should preferabl y be from disparate regions of the body and should include, where applicable, 
mediastinal and retroperitoneal areas. Non -nodal lesions include those in solid organs (eg, liver, spleen, kidneys, 
lungs), GI involvement, cutaneous lesions, or those noted on p alpation. Nonmeasured lesions: Any disease not 
selected as measured, dominant disease and truly assessable disease should be considered not measured. These 
sites include any nodes, nodal masses, and extranodal sites not selected as dominant or measurable o r that do not 
meet the requirements for measurability but are still considered abnormal, as well as truly assessable disease, 
which is any site of suspected disease that would be difficult to follow quantitatively with measurement, 
including pleural effusi ons, ascites, bone lesions, leptomeningeal disease, abdominal masses, and other lesions 
that cannot be confirmed and followed by imaging. In Waldeyer’s ring or in extranodal sites (eg, GI tract, liver, 
bone marrow), FDG uptake may be greater than in the me diastinum with complete metabolic response, but 
should be no higher than surrounding normal physiologic uptake (eg, with marrow activation as a result of 
chemotherapy or myeloid growth factors).  
 
†PET 5PS: 1 = no uptake above background; 2 = uptake < media stinum; 3 = uptake > mediastinum but ≤ liver; 
4 = uptake moderately > liver; 5 =   uptake markedly higher than liver and/or new lesions; X = new areas of 
uptake unlikely to be related to lymphoma.

 APPENDIX 2:  RESPONSE EVALUATION CRITERIA IN SOLID 
TUMORS  
Tumor response assessments in this clinical trial will utilize Response Evaluation Criteria in 
Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.1) based on the following 2009 article:   Eisenhauer EA, Therasse P, Bogaerts J, Schwartz LH, Sargent D, Ford R, et al. New response 
evaluation criteria in solid tumours: revised RECIST guideline (version 1.1). Eur J Cancer. 2009;45(2):228-47.  The modifications to RECIST 1.1 to be implemented in this trial are: 1) chest x -rays may not be 
used to follow disease; only CT scans may be used to follow chest disease, and 2) the minimum duration of stable disease (or non- CR/non -PD for subjects with nontarget lesions only) is 7 
weeks following the date of first dose of study drug.  The Eisenhauer article, published in the European Journal of Cancer, is available online at: http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0959804908008733

 APPENDIX 4: NYHA FUNCTIONAL CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM 
 
The New York Heart Association (NYHA) Functional Classification: Class I, II, III, or IV 
Heart Failure provides a simple way of classifying the extent of heart failure.  It places subjects 
in one of 4 categories based on the level of limitation experienced during physical activity.  
Clas s Symptoms  
Class I  
(Mild)  No limitation of physical activity.  Ordinary physical activity does not cause undue 
fatigue, palpitation , or dyspnea (shortness of breath).  
Class II  
(Mild)  Slight limitation of physical activity.  Comfortable at rest, but ordinary physical 
activity results in fatigue, palpitation , or dyspnea.  
Class III  
(Moderate)  Marked limitation of physical activity.  Comfortable at rest, but less than ordinary 
physical activity results in fatigue, palpitation , or dyspnea.  
Class IV  
(Seve re) Unable to carry out any physical activity without discomfort.  Symptoms of cardiac 
insufficiency at rest.  If any physical activity is undertaken, discomfort is increased.

OVERALL RATIONALE FOR PROTOCOL AMENDMENT 05
Study enrollment closed on 08-Sep-2021. Several enrollment challenges significantly impacted 
study timelines, notably the coronavirus di sease 2019 (COVID-19) pand emic  
. In addition, enrollment of patients with measurable 
disease at baseline was difficult after reaching the cap on patients with non-measurable disease. 
Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMS) determined that the number of patients enrolled will be 
sufficient to inform the efficacy and safety for the 4 arms of Cohort D.
Protocol Amendment 05 includes changes to modi fy the sample size, accrual duration for Cohort 
D, and timing of dual primary endpoint analyses to reflect actual enrollment and time. Due to 
prolonge d enrollment from C ohort D-Part 1 and BMS reprioriti zation, C ohort D-Part 2 w ill no 
longer be conducted. Additional guidance related to  COVID-19 was also added to the amendment.

Q3W + prednisone 10mg PO D1-D21 up to 10 cycles
Study Phase: II
Research Hypothesis: Treatment with nivolumab combined with ipilimumab will have clinical activity in subjects 
with metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).
Objectives:
Primary Objectives : 
•Evaluate objective response r ate (O RR) by Response Evaluation Cr iteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1 assessed 
by Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR) in subjects with mCRPC and measurable disease at baseline per 
investigator assessment as entered in the interactive web response system (IWRS).
•Assess Radiographic Progression Free Survival (rPFS) assessed by BICR in all treated subjects with mCRPC in 
Cohorts B and C, and a ll randomized subjects with mCRPC in Cohort D using RECIST v1.1 for soft tissue disease 
progression and PCWG2 for bone disease progression.
Secondary Objectives:
•Assess radiographic/clinical Progression Free Survival (rcPFS) .
•Assess overall survival (OS).
•Evaluate PSA response rate (PSA-RR)
•Determine the safety and toler ability in all treated subjects.
•Estimate changes in pain as measured by the Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form (BPI-SF)
•Estimate changes in cancer-related symptoms and quality of life (QoL) using the FACT-P questionnaire (Cohort 
D only)
•Estimate changes in health status and health utility as  measured by the 3-level EuroQol Five Dimensions 
questionnaire (EQ-5D-3L)
Study Design for Cohorts A, B, C: This is a Phase 2 open-label study of ni volumab plus ipilimumab in subjects with
metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).

The trial will include 3 treatment cohorts dosed with nivolumab 1 mg/kg plus ipilimumab 3 mg/kg (see Study Design 
Schema below). No dose increases or reductions will be allowed for either drug.
Approximately 90 subjects will be treated in 3 cohorts as follows:Cohort A: Asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic mCRPC subjects who have not been treated with and are unable 
or unwilling to receiv e second generation hormone therapies or cytotoxic chemotherapy in mCRPC setting. 
Enrollment discontinued per Revised Protocol 02.
Cohort B : Asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic mCRPC s ubjects who must have progressed after second 
generation hormone therapies in mCRPC setting and have not been treated with cytotoxic chemotherapy in mCRPC 
setting.
Cohort C : Subjects must have progressed after prior taxane-based cytotoxic chemotherapy in the mCRPC setting.
Per Revised Protocol 02, Cohor t A enrollment will be discontinued due to slow accrual and to reflect the changing 
landscape of mCRPC (see Section 1.1.10). Addendum in the protocol). Per Revised Protocol 02, the remainder of 
planned number of patients for Cohort A will be allocated to Cohorts B and C in order to have more precise efficacy 
estimates in those arms. In each of the 2 cohorts B and C, at least 30 subjects must have RECIST v 1.1 defined 
measurable disease and no more than 15 subjects will have non-measurable disease by RECIST v1.1.
Subjects w ill be treated with up to 4 cy cles of nivolumab in combination with ip ilimumab (Part 1, See Section 4.3.1  
of the protocol), followe d by monotherapy nivolumab monotherapy (Part 2, Section 4.3.2  of the protocol) until 
progression of disease, unacceptable toxicity,  or subject withdra wal of consent. In Part 1, a minimum of 1 combination 
cycle of nivolumab and ipilimumab is required. 
In Part 1, each treatment cy cle will be 3 weeks in duration. Nivolumab and ipilimumab will be dosed every 3 weeks 
for four doses. After completion of the last combination cycle in Part 1 (i.e. 6 weeks after the last dose of nivolumab 
plus ipilimumab), subjects will then receive nivolumab monotherapy every four weeks in Part 2 until progression of 
disease, unacceptable toxicity, or subject withdrawal of consent. 
Subjects experiencing adverse events (AEs) related to  combination dose therapy (Part 1) that do not meet dose 
discontinuation criteria, may proceed to nivolumab monoth erapy dosing (Part 2) without completing all 4 combination 
doses, after consultation with Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS) Medical Monitor, on a case-by-case basis.Subjects from Cohorts B and C who entered the maintenance period may be permitted re -induction with the 
combination upon PSA progression or radi ographic progression (whichever occurs first) and after approval by the 
BMS medical monitor.It is strongly recommended that subjects in Arms A, B, and C limit treatment duration with immunotherapy treatment 
for up to 2 years. See Section 1.1.13 .

Schema for Cohorts A, B, and C
Study Design for Cohort D: This is a phase 2 open-label study evaluati ng different dosing regimens containing
nivolumab plus ipilimumab, ipilimumab alone, or cabazitaxel in subjects with mCRPC who have progressed and 
have received docetaxel -containing regimen.
The addition of Cohort D to the trial will include 4 treatment arms. For Cohort D, approximately 259 subjects will be 
randomized in a 2:2:1:2 ratio to one of 4 open-label treatment arms including two new combination arms (Arm D1 
and Arm D2) evaluating alternative nivolumab plus ipilimumab  doses and schedules, one arm (Arm D3) evaluating 
ipilimumab monotherapy, and one reference arm (Arm D4) evaluating SOC treatment in this setting cabazitaxel (see study schema below). Randomization will be stratified by the presence or absence of measurable disease (measurable 
vs non-measurable disease) at study entry to ensure treatment arms are balanced. 
Subjects in Arms D1 and D2 experiencing drug-related AEs with combination dose therapy that do not lead to study 
treatment discontinuation due to toxicity may proceed to nivolumab monotherapy dosing without completing all 
4 combination cycles. Subjects must have received at least 1 dose of combination th erapy before proceeding to 
nivolumab monotherapy after consultation with the Medical Monitor, on a case-by-case basis. 
Nivolumab monotherapy in Arms D1 and D2 may continue until progression of disease, unacceptable toxicity, 2 year 
maximum treatment duration, or subject withdrawal of consent.
Furthermore, subjects from these Arms D1 and D2 who entered the maintenance period may be permitted re-induction 
with the combination upon PSA progression or radiographic progression (whichever occurs first) and after approval 
by the BMS medical monitor.
Subjects treated in Arms D3 and D4 who demonstrate radiographic progression on or after treatment may be eligible 
to receive optional crossover nivolumab in combination with ipilimu mab (Arm D1) upon BICR c onfirmed 
radiographic progression if their case is reviewed with and approved by the BMS Medical Monitor.

NOTES:
a. Subjects with investigator-assessed non-measurable disease at baseline will be capped when approximately 105 
subjects are randomized.
b. Subjects in Arms D1 and D2 experiencing drug-relat ed AEs with combination dose therapy that do not lead to 
study treatment discontinuation due to toxicity may proceed to nivolumab monotherapy dosing without 
completing all 4 combination cycles. Subjects who entered the maintenance period may be permitted re-induction 
with the combination after approval by the BMS medical monitor.
c. Subjects in Arms D3 and D4 who have BICR c onfirmed progression on or after treatment have the option to 
crossover to Arm D1 after approval by the BMS medical monitor
d. Radiographic progression per RECIST 1.1 or PCWG2 ( Section 5.5.3 ). Treatment beyond investigator-assessed 
RECIST 1.1-defined progression may be considered for subjects meeting criteria according to Section 4.5.4
In accordance with Revised Protocol 03, additional s ubjects who have progressed after prior docetaxel-containing 
regimen will be enrolled into Cohort D.
Interim reviews of safety and efficacy data will be performed on all subjects receiving IO therapy by the Sponsor and 
participating investigators from the Study Steering Committee for Cohort D after the first 15 treated subjects for each cohort/arm have at least 8 weeks of follow-up after first dose and at least one post-baseline tumor assessment. This 
interim review will be used to evaluate early severe toxicity events and early disease control at Week 8 in order to provide information regarding safety and futility to make decisions about whether to continue patient accrual onto the study.

♦Cohort A : Subjects with asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic mCPRC who have not been treated 
with and are unable or unwilling to receive second generation hormone therapies or cytotoxic 
chemotherapy. Enrollment discontinued per Revised Protocol 02 .
♦Cohort B : Subjects with asymptomatic or minimally sy mptomatic mCPRC who have progressed after 
second generation hormone therapies and have not been treated with cytotoxic chemotherapy.
♦Cohort C : Subjects must have progressed after prior tax ane-based cytotoxic chemotherapy in the 
mCRPC setting. 
♦Cohort D : Subjects must have progressed after pr ior docetaxel-containing regimen. Cohort D will

anti-bone resorptive therapy that was initiated more than 28 days prior to study treatment
•Sufficient tumor samples from either a fresh biopsy (collected during screening period) or archival tumor tissue in the form of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded [FFPE ] block or a minimum of 15 unstain ed tumor tissue slides. 
Archival tumor samples must be obtained within 1 year prior to enrollment date, either from a metastatic tumor 
lesion (preferred) or from a pr imary tumor lesion that has not been previously irradiated. Tumor samples collected 
more than 1 year prior to enrollment d ate may be acceptable if obtained in  the metastatic setting and following 
discussion with and approval by the BMS Medical Mon itor/designee. Tumor sample may be from core biopsy, 
punch biopsy, excisional biopsy, or surgical specimen). Fine  needle aspiration is unacceptable for submission.
 Central laboratory must confirm receipt of tumor samples prior to randomization.

Key Study Assessments:
•Adverse Events will be collected to determine the incidence of drug-related adverse events in each cohort
•Subjects will be assessed by computer tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and radionuclide 
bone scans at baseline and on-treatment beginning Week 8 ( ±7 days) from first dose of study therapy and 
continuing every 8 weeks ( ±7 days) for the first 6 months and then every 12 weeks ( ±7 days) weeks until disease 
progression
•Patient-reported outcomes will be collected using the EQ-5D-3L, FACT-P, and BPI-SF. See Section 5.8 for 
assessment for Cohorts A, B, C, and D. 
Statistical Considerations:
Sample Size: Study Design (Cohorts A, B, and C) Approximately 90 subjects with mCRPC will be enrolled and treated in 2 
cohorts, subjects who must have progressed after sec ond-generation hormone therapies but have not received 
cytotoxic chemotherapy, and subjects who have progre ssed following cytotoxic ch emotherapy (Cohorts B and C,
respectively). Each cohort will consist of 30 or more s ubjects with measurable diseas e at baseline per RECIST v1.1 
and no more than 15 with non-measurable disease. 
This open-label Phase 2 study is not designed to statistically test specific hypotheses. Therefore the sample size is not 
based on statistical power calculations, but the size in each cohort is calculated using the observed objective response rate among treated subjects with measurable disease at baseline.
Study Design for Cohort D: Approximately 259 subjects with mCRPC, previously treated with docetaxel, will be 
randomized and treated in Cohort D. These 259 subjects will be randomized between 4 arms in a 2:2:1:2 ratio (74, 74, 
37, and 74 subjects in Arms D1, D2, D3, and D4, respectively) and stratified by presence/absence of measurable 
disease by RECIST v1.1 per investigator assessment at st udy entry to ensure tr eatment arms are b alanced. Subjects 
with non-measurable disease at baseline by RECIST v1.1 per investigator assessment will be capped when approximately 105 subjects are randomized so that the remaining 154 sub jects (44, 44, 22, and 44 subjects in Arms
D1, D2, D3, and D4, respectively) will have measurable disease at baseline.
Cohort D w ill evaluate the a bove immunotherapy regimens and the sta ndard of care comparator cabazitaxel in 
unselected mCRPC patients.

Endpoints:
The dual primary endpoints are Objective Response Rate (ORR) and radiographic Progression-Free Survival (rPFS)
by BICR (BICR assessment will be performed retrospectively in Cohorts B and C, and prospectively in Cohort D).
The secondary e ndpoints are Radiographic/Clinical Progression-Free Survival (rcPFS), Overall Survival (OS), PSA 
response rate (PSA-RR), overall safety and tolerability, changes in pain (meas ured by BPI-SF), changes in disease-
related symptoms and qu ality of life (measured by the FACT-P), and cha nges in health statu s and utility  (measured 
by EQ-5D-3L).
Statistical Analyses:
For Cohorts B and C, all eff icacy analyses w ill be performed by cohort as applicab le to either (i) subjects with 
investigator-assessed measurable disease by RECIST v1.1 and/or (ii) total number of subjects within each cohort. All 
efficacy data for treated subjects in Cohort A, if any, will be listed. For Cohort D, efficacy analysis will be performed 
by treatment arm for all randomized subjects.
For the dual primary endpoint of ORR, estimated rates and corresponding 95% exact confidence intervals (CIs) will 
be calculated using the Clopper-Pearson method for all treated subjects with measurable disease at baseline per 
RECIST v1.1 in Cohorts B and C and for all randomized sub jects with measurab le disease at baseline per RECIST 
v1.1 as entered in IWRS in Cohort D. In Cohorts B and C, estimated odds ratios and differences and corresponding 95% CIs between cohorts will be calculated  for descriptive purpose. In Cohort D, se nsitivity analysis of ORR may 
also be performed for all randomized subjects with measurab le disease at baseline as entered in the CRF if the 
discrepancy rate is higher than 5%.
For time to event endpoints (eg, dual primary endpoint of rPFS, and secondary endpoints of rcPFS and OS), medians 
and rates at months 6 and 12 and corresponding 95% CIs will be estimated for each c ohort via the Kaplan-Meier 
methodology for all treated subjects in Cohorts B and C, and similar analyses will be done for each treatment arm for all randomized sub jects in Cohort D. Kaplan-M eier plots will be presented for e ach cohort for Cohorts B and C; 
similarly, Kaplan-Meier plots will be displayed by tr eatment arm for all randomized subjects in Cohort D. Note that 
these analyses will be stratified by the stratification factor when these are conducted for Cohort D.
Estimate of PSA-RR and corresponding 2-sided exact 95% CI using the Clopper-Pearson method will be performed
on all treated subjects with PSA values at baseline and at least one post-baseline assessment for Cohorts B and C;
similar analysis will be done for each treatment arm i n Cohort D with PSA values at baseline and at least one post-
baseline assessment. Note that this analysis will be stratified by the stratification factor when conducted for Cohort D.
For all treated subjects with measurable disease at baseline in Cohorts B and C,  will be summarized by cohort 
for subjects with a BOR of PR or CR using the Kaplan-Meier methodology. Med ian values, along with two-sided 
95% CIs will also be calculated. Summary statistics of  will be provided by cohort for subjects with a BOR of 
CR or PR. For all randomized subjects  with measurable disease at bas eline by RECIST v1.1 pe r investigator 
assessment as entered in IWRS in Cohort D, similar  and  analyses will be repeated by treatment arm.

Clinical Protocol CA209650
BMS-936558 nivolumab 
1 INTRODUCTION AND STUDY RATIONALE
CA209650 is a Phase 2, open-label study of the evaluation of efficacy, safety and tolerability of 
same day sequential dosing of nivolumab followed by ipilimumab, in subjects with metastatic 
castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Subjects with mCRPC, defined as castrate resistant 
prostate cancer and M1 metastatic disease on bone, CT and/or MRI scan per NCCN criteria1, who 
are either asymptomatic or min imally symp tomatic, will be evaluated in 3 cohorts as follows: 
(A) Subjects who have never received tr eatment either with cytotoxic chemotherapy or second-
generation hormone therapies such  as enzalutamide and/or abiraterone, (B) Subjects who have 
progressed after second-generation hormone therapies such as enzalutamide and/or abirate rone but 
have not been treated with cytotoxic chemotherapy (C) Subjects who have progressed after 
treatment with cytotoxic chemotherapy. Cohort A enrollment will be discontinued in Revised 
Protocol 02 due to slow accrual and to reflect the changing landscape of metastatic castration-
resistant prostate cancer ( Section 1.1.10 , Addendum).
The study aims to demonstrate that tr eatment with nivolumab combined with ip ilimumab will have 
clinical activity in subjects with mCRPC. Additional objectives of the study include further characterization of efficacy, safety and tolerability, determining changes in patient-reported 
outcomes for quality of life assessments and pain measures, as well as pharmacokinetics, 
 .
In accordance with Revised Protocol 03, the st udy will enroll a new cohort of subjects (Cohort D) 
who have progressed after prior docetaxel-containing regimen. In Cohort D, subjects w ill be 
randomized to one of four open-label tr eatment arms including two new combination arms 
evaluating alternative nivolumab plus ipilimumab doses and schedules, one arm evaluating 
ipilimumab monotherapy, and one reference arm evaluating SOC tr eatment in this setting 
(cabazitaxel). The aim of C ohort D is to s elect a combination immunotherapy regimen with 
optimal benefit/risk profile .
1.1 Study Rationale
1.1.1 Disease Background
Prostate cancer is a leading cause of cancer mortality in men worldwide.
2With an estimated 
incidence of 220,800 new cases and 27,540 deaths in 2015, prostate cancer is the most frequently 
diagnosed cancer and second most frequent cause of cancer deaths in US males.3In Europe 
prostate cancer was the third most common cancer in 2012, with 417,000 new cases and 92,000 deaths from prostate cancer being reported in that year.
4
In 1941, Huggins and Hodges first noted the bene ficial effects of castration and injection of 
estrogens in subjects with metastatic prostate cancer.5Over time, androgen deprivation therapy 
(ADT), defined as medical castration, became the cornerstone of treatment for subjects with 
metastatic disease, as well as for subjects with localized or locally advanced prostate cancers when administered as neoadjuvant, concomitant or adjuva nt therapy in combination with radiation.

by a decline in levels of p rostate-sp ecific antigen (PSA),6most subjects become resistant with 
disease progression occurring with in a median of 18–24 months of continuous hormonal 
manipulation.7
Prostate Cancer Working Group 2 (PCWG2)8categorizes the disease conti nuum of prostate cancer 
as a rising PSA state as non-castrate or castrate subjects, with either non-measurable disease or 
with distant metastases, on the basis of (i) whether the serum testosterone level is in the castrate 
range of ≤  50 ng/dL by surgical orchiectomy or med ical therapy with gonadotropin-releasing 
hormone analogs and anti-androgens  and (ii) presence or absence of metastases detectable 
clinically or by imaging.1Metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) is defined as 
subjects with confirmed castrate levels of test osterone following orchiectomy or treatment with 
ADT, and presence of distant soft tissue or bony metastases by NCCN criteria.1Subjects with 
established metastatic CRPC (mCRPC) have a life expectancy in the range of 27 to 
32 months.9,10,11
In 1996, mitoxantrone plus prednisone was approved for the treatment of subjects with mCRPC 
based on improvement in pain palliation.12In 2004, 2 Phase 3 studies (TAX327 and SWOG 
S9916) demonstrated that docetaxel- based regimens can improve overall survival of subjects with 
mCRPC.13,14However, docetaxel-based tr eatment is associated with clin ically significant 
toxicities that greatly limit its use in the management of lower risk, asymptomatic and minimally 
symptomatic mCRPC subjects wi thout visceral metastases. 
Since 2010, six new therapeutic agents with diverse mechanisms of action have been added to the therapeutic armamentarium, five of which si puleucel-T, cabazitaxel, abiraterone, enzalutamide, 
and radium-223, have been approved for the treatment of mCRPC based on improvement in median overall survival. While the availability of these new treatment options allows for tailoring therapy to patient characteristics such as pre sence or absence of symptoms, prior treatments, 
patient preferences and life expectancy, it is also recognized that none of these therapies result in 
durable clinical responses. Despite high init ial res ponse rates, remissions following second-
generation hormone therapies are temporary15due to the occurrence of resistance mechanisms 
including androgen receptor reactivation.16At this time, with judicious sequencing and use of 
available new therapies, subjects with establis hed metastatic CRPC (ie, without prior 
chemotherapy) have life expectancy in the range of 27 to 32 months.9,10,11Thus mCRPC remains 
a disease with a lethal outcome with the urgent need for tr eatment options  that will provide durable 
disease control and long term survival.
1.1.2 Rationale for Immunotherapy in Castrate Resistant Prostate Cancer 
(CRPC)
Immunotherapy agents represent a promising approach for chemotherapy-free alternatives for the 
management of asymptomatic and minimally symptomatic CRPC subjects.
1) Like most types of cancer, prostate cancer de velops in an immune-competent environment.

infiltration and inflammatory pathway activation.17Evidence from animal models and human 
prostate cancer suggests that desp ite the presence of immune eff ector cells that recognize tumor 
antigens, these cells are actively tolerized and become incapable of mediating tumor 
destruction.18The induction of regulato ry or suppressor T cells19with increased CD4+CD25+ 
and CD8+Foxp3+ regulatory T c ells (Treg) d etected both within pros tate glands and in the 
peripheral blood of prostate cancer subjects , suggests the presence of active immune 
suppression of antitumor immunity.20,21
These lines of eviden ce support targ eting the immune system itself via activation of T cells 
and overcoming T-cell tolerance, to result  in durable antitumor activity in prostate cancer. 
2) The inherent characteristics of prostate cancer also make it an ideal target for immunotherapy. 
Prostate cancer is gener ally considered a slow-growing-tumor, wh ich may allow adequate time 
for an immunotherapy agent to activate the immune system. 
Furthermore, prostate cancer has many well-des cribed tumor-associated antigens (TAAs), 
which may be ideal targets for immunotherapy such as vaccines because they are specific to 
the cancer. Examples of TAA for prostate cancer include PSA, prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP), and prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA). This has led to the evaluation of 
therapeutic cancer vaccines designed to break immune tolerance
22being explored in subjects 
with early CRPC, ie, before chemotherapy, with vaccines of autol ogous origin,23poxvirus,24
and PSA TRICOM.25
Prostvac (developed by the National Cancer Institute and licensed to BN Immunotherapeutics, 
Mountain View, CA), is a prostate cancer vaccine consisting of a recombinant vaccinia vector 
as a primary vaccination, engineered to express prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and a triad of 
human T-cell cos timulatory molecules (designated TRICOM). A multicenter randomized 
phase II study that randomized minimally sy mptomatic mCRPC subjects to Prostvac vs 
placebo showed preliminary evidence of improved overall survival.26The IMPACT study 
evaluated Sipuleucel-T (Dendreon Corp., Seattle, WA) an autologous vaccine vs. pl acebo in 
chemotherapy-naïve CRPC subjects and reported a 4.1 month survival improvement in 
asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic CRPC subjects.27While these preliminary data show
little overall impact on delaying progression of disease, the reported benefits in overall survival
may be considered “proof of concept” that immunotherapeutic agents can play an important 
role in treating advanced prostate cancer.28
While antigen-specific therapies such as vaccines have shown evidence of potential for benefit 
in the clinic, this approach has many limitations,29,30,31,32underscoring the need to explore 
immunotherapy that does not rely mainly  on the expression of a specific antigen.
3) Androgen-deprivation thera py (ADT), a mainstay of treatment for both high-risk early prostate 
cancer and recurrent and/or metastatic disease,  has been shown to alter the immune 
environment in prostate cancer.33For example, neoadjuvant ADT of prostate cancer subjects 
results in increased numbers of infiltrating CD4 T cells, CD8 T cells, natural killer cells, and 
macrophages in prostate tissues.34,35Mouse models have shown that ADT increases the

number of T cells in peripheral lymphoid tissues and pros tate glands, e nhances T-cell 
proliferation to antigen, promotes recovery of T- and B-cell p opulations following 
chemotherapy36and mitigates tolerance of prostate-s pecific CD4 T cells. Furthermore, ADT 
has also been shown to reverse age-related thymic atrophy in mice and to restore thymic T- cell 
output in both mice and prostate cancer subjects.37
Immunotherapy agents in conjunction with standard of care therapy ie, ADT could potentially 
result in increasing immune-mediated anti-t umor activity in subjects with prostate cancer.
Taken together, these lines of evidence st rongly s upport the con tinued investigation of 
immunotherapy agents to im prove outcomes in mCRPC. Acc ordingly, alternate approaches 
aimed at targeting the immune system  itself to result in durab le antitumor activ ity, including 
evaluation of combination checkpoint blockade inhibition, are warranted.

1.1.4 Rationale for Nivolumab and Ipilimumab in Prostate Cancer
(i) Ipilimumab in prostate cancer:
Due to its potentially broad mechanism of acti on, ip ilimumab has been investigated in several 
other solid tumor settings, including mCRPC. In fact, the first in-human study of ipilimumab was 
in prostate cancer: an investigation of a single 3 mg/kg dose of ipilimumab in 14 subjects with 
CRPC.42Ipilimumab as a single dose had acceptable pharmacokinetic and safety profiles, but only 
two of the 14 subjects experienced PSA declines of  > 50%. Results have since been reported for 
six other clinical studies of ipilimumab in mCRPC42. Together, these seven trials encompassed 
240 subjects across multiple settings of adva nced CRPC, roughl y 20% of whom had progressed 
on or relapsed after docetaxel.43These studies utilized multiple doses (ranging from 0.5 to 
10 mg/kg as either monotherapy or in combination studies) and schedules (ranging from a single 
dose of ipil imumab to recurring doses every 3 weeks for four  cycles) and demons trated th e clinical 
activity of ipilimumab  3, 5 and 10 mg/kg, defined as PSA response, in the tr eatment of mCRPC 
(Table 1.1.4-1 )w h e t h er used as monotherapy,42with ADT44or with other interventions such as 
radiothera py,45or oth er immunotherapeutics with different mechanisms of action.46,47,48,49In 
3s t u d i e s  w hich includ ed ipilimumab monotherapy at 3 mg/kg in mCRPC, PSA responses were 
observed in 6 of 44 evaluable patients (13.6%). In one study which included ipilimumab monotherapy at 10 mg/kg, PSA responses were observed in 4 of 16 patients (25%).

Two Phase 3 Studies (CA184043 and CA184095) carried out subsequently have failed to show a 
clear-cut survival advantage for ipilimumab (10 mg/kg) over placebo. An updated, double-blind, 
randomized Phase 3 study in  subjects with mCRPC who had received prior tr eatment with 
docetaxel for their disease, did not meet its primary endpoint of demonstrating a statistically 
significant prolongation of survival for the ipilimumab group compared with the placebo group. No difference in overall survival was noted between subjects who received ipilimumab and those 
who received placebo after bone-dir ected radiotherapy.50However, the assessment of the 
proportional hazards assumption showed that it  was violated (p=0.0031) in the primary analysis.
A piecewise hazard model showed that the HR changed over time: the HR for 0–5 months was 
1.46 (95% CI 1.10–1.95), for 5–12 months was 0.65 (0.50–0.85), and beyond 12 months was 0.60 
(0.43–0. 86). Kaplan-Meier (K-M) survival curves s how the ipilimumab group to be below the 
placebo group through approximately Month 8, after which  time the K-M survival curves crossed, 
and the ipilimumab group remained above the placebo group fo r the remainder of the follow-up 
phase (See Figure 1.1.4-1 ). In addition, ipilimumab was associ ated with reductions in PSA 
concentration (13.1% [95% CI.9·5–17.5] for ipilimumab and 5.2% [3.0–8.4] for placebo) and an 
improvement in PFS compared with placebo (median 4.0 [95% CI 3.6–4.3] vs 3.1 [2.9–3.4] 
months; HR 0.70, 95% CI 0. 61–0.82; p<0.0001). PFS was a composite endpoint based on 
confirmed PSA progression, confirmed  radiological progression, clinical d eterioration, or death. 
A long-term survival analysis with 2-years of additional follow-up from the primary analysis of 
the CA184-043 study showed that survival si gnificantly favored the ipilimumab arm (HR =0.83 
(95% CI: 0.71-0.96); p=0.013).51Landmark OS rates in the ipilimumab and placebo arms were 
15.3% (95% CI: 11.7, 18.9) versus 7.9% (95% CI: 5.2, 10.6) at 3 years, 10.1% (95% CI: 6.9, 13.3) 
vs. 3.3% (95% CI: 1.3, 5.3) at 4 years, and 7.9% (95% CI: 4.4, 11.4) vs. 2.7% (95% CI: 0.8, 4.7) 
at 5 years. There were 49/399 long-term survivors in the ipilimumab arm and 29/400 in the placebo 
arm. 
Similarly, study CA184095 a double-blind, ra ndomized Phase 3 study in subjects with 
asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic, chemotherapy-naïve, mCRPC with no known visceral 
metastases did not meet its primary endpoint ba sed on intent-to-treat analysis (HR 1.11; 95.87% 
CI: 0.88, 1.39; P value = 0.3667) for OS. However, treatment w ith ipilimumab was associated with
longer median PFS (defined as time to confirmed PSA or radiological progression, clinical 
deterioration, or death) in the ipilimumab group (5.6 months) versus the placebo group (3.8 months, HR, 0.67; 95.87% CI, 0.55 to 0.81), longer median time to non-hormonal cytoxic 
chemotherapy (HR, 0.65; 95.87% CI, 0.52 to 0.83) a nd to docetaxel therapy (HR, 0.70; 95% CI,
0.55 to 0.88) in the ipilimumab arm vers us placebo. In addition, a higher PSA response rate was 
observed with ipilimumab (23%; 95% CI, 19% to 27%) compared to placebo (8%, 95% CI, 5% to 
13%).
Given the improved tolerability of ipilimumab 3 mg/kg compared to 10 mg/kg and the clinical 
activity observed at the 3 mg/kg dose, the current study w ill assess ip ilimumab 3 mg/kg in Arm 
D3  with the aim 
of identifying a subset of men with CRPC who may benefit from ip ilimumab treatment. Arm D3

(ii) PD-1/PD-L1 pathway in Prostate cancer
Prostate cancer has b een shown to have low tumor expression of PD-L1.52However, in a study 
evaluating human pr ostate can cer cell lines for PD-L1 expression and loss of phosphatase and 
tensin homolog (PTEN) by flow cytometry and western blo tting, many prostate cancer cell lines 
upregulated PD-L1 e xpression in response to inflammatory cytokines in vit ro, consistent with 
adaptive immune resistance. In these cell lines, no association between PTEN loss and PD-L1 
expression was apparent. In primary prostate tumors, PD-L1 e xpression was rare, and was not 
associated with PTEN loss s uggesting that innate immune resis tance was not a likely mechanism 
of immune resistance as a mechanism resulting in decreased antitumor immune responses in 
prostate cancer (as opposed to an adaptive immune  resistance response mechanisms (refer to 
Section 1.1.2 ).53Furthermore, an analysis of the prognostic significance of PD-1 and/or PD-L1 
expression in a cohort of 535 pr ostate can cer tumors showed that a high density of PD-1+ 
lymphocytes indepe ndently predicted shorter clin ical failure-free survival.54This may indicate that 
tumor immune escape, and thus tumor immune elimination, are important mechanisms in prostate 
cancer, and the association of pathway molecules with poor prognosis makes th em attractive 
targets for inhibition. 
Nivolumab monotherapy was evaluated in a cohort of 17 subjects with mCRPC.55All subjects 
with mCRPC were treated with nivolumab 10 mg/kg, and no objective responses were observed. 
One out of 10 subjects evaluable for PSA response demonstr ated a PSA reduction ≥50% from

baseline. Prostate tumor samples were available in 2 subjects with mCRPC, and tumor PD-L1 
expression was 0% in both subjects. 
Other anti-PD-(L)1 inhibitors have also demonstrated limited clinical activity in mCRPC. 
Atezolizumab monotherapy was evaluated in a pha se 1a study, including 15 heavily pretreated 
subjects with mCRPC.56There were no objective responses per RECIST v1.1, although 1 subject 
had a PR per immune-related response criteria (irRC). Analysis of tumor tissue in this subject 
revealed no PD-L1 IHC expression at baseline but did demonstrate an ATM mutation, a 
component of the DNA damage response pathway.
Pembrolizumab was recently evaluated in a pha se 2 study of mCRPC patients previously treated 
with docetaxel.57Among those with measurable disease, ORR was 3% and 5% in PD-L1 negative
(n=67) and positive (n=131) patients, respectively. PSA responses were observed in 11% of 
evaluable patients (n = 193). Among 19 patients with somatic aberrations in BRCA1/2 or ATM,ORR was 11%, suggesting that DNA repair defects may be associated with anti-tumor activity. In conclusion, single-agent PD-(L)1 inhibitors a ppear to have limited anti -tumor activity in mCRPC.
(iii) Role for dual checkpoint blockade inhibition: (anti-CTLA4 and anti -PD-1) in prostate cancer
Consistent with the above pre-clinical d ata, it has been observed that ip ilimumab induces an 
adaptive immune response within the prostate tumor microenvironment.
58In a clinical trial, 
subjects with localized prostate cancer who were treated with ADT plus 2 doses of anti-CTLA4 antibody (ipilimumab) observed an increased frequency of CD4 and CD8 T cell infiltration into 
tumor tissues. Treatment with ipilimumab also led to increased expression  of PD-1 and PD-L1 (on 
both immune and epithelial cells).
58Of particular interest was the finding that PD-L1 expression 
in the tumor microenvironment co -localized with CD8 T cells in prostate tumors after ipilimumab 
treatment. Since CD8 T cells are the key effector immune cells that mediate tumor rejection, it is possible that increased expression of PD-L1, as w ell as PD-1, occurs on T cells as a criti cal 
mechanism to suppress T cell res ponses in tissues, resulting in tumor growth. These results are 
consistent with recent reports that CD8 T cells and PD-L1 expression are co-localized in the 
melanoma tumor microenvironment.
59,60
In summary, while treatment with ipilimumab resulted  in expected immune augmentation, it was 
also associated with the induction of immune in hibitory PD-1/PD-L1 pathway, providing perhaps 
a potential explanation as to why a significan t proportion of subjects with prostate cancer did not 
benefit from tr eatment with ip ilimumab or nivolumab as monotherapy. Accordingly, utilizing a 
combination checkpoint blockade inhibition approach with anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1 agents 
may be necessary to boost anti-tumor activit y for maximum clinical benefit in prostate cancer.
Combination of nivolumab 1 mg/kg plus ipilimumab 3 mg/kg Q3W for up to 4 doses, followed by
nivolumab 480 mg every 4 weeks has been evaluated in Cohorts B and C of this study. A safety and efficacy analysis (Database lock date 03-Jul- 2018) was conducted in all treated patients with 
at least 24 weeks of follow-up in Cohort B (n=33) and Cohort C (n=45). Among patients with baseline measurable disease, ORR was 26% in Cohort B and 10% in Cohort C. Am ong p atients

for HRD and TMB testing (TMB “high” and “lo w” represent above and below the median of  74.5 
mutations per patient). ORR were higher in HRD positive (67% [2/3] in Cohort B and 50% [1/2] 
in Cohort C) compared to  HRD negative patients (25% [4/16] in Cohort B and 17% [2/12] in 
Cohort C). Similarly, ORR was higher in TMB-high patients (60% [6/10] in Cohort B and 50% [3/6] in Cohort C) compared to TMB-low patients (0% in both Cohorts B and C).
Confirmed/unconfirmed PSA decline ≥50% in patients with baseline and ≥ 1 post-baseline PSA 
result were 21% Cohort B and 15% in Cohort C.
Grade 3–4 treatment-related advers e events occurred in 39% and 51% of pts in cohorts B and C, 
respectively; one gr ade 5 event occurred in each cohort (sudden death in Cohort B and septic shock
in Cohort C). Although the sa fety profile was consistent with studies in other malignancies using 
the same dosing schedule, early toxicity prevented the majority of patients from completing 4 
combination doses.
Furthermore, combination of nivolumab 3 mg/kg plus ipilimumab 1 mg/kg every 3 weeks for f our 
doses, then maintenance nivolumab 3 mg/kg eve ry 2 weeks was recently evaluated in 15 patients 
with AR-V7-positive mCRPC.
61Overall, the PSA response r ate was 2/15 (13%), ORR was 2/8 
(25%) in those with measurable disease, median PSA-PFS was 3.0 (95% CI 2.1– NR) months, 
PFS was 3.7 (95%CI 2.8–7.5) months, and OS was 8.2 (95%CI 5.5– 10.4) months. Outcomes 
appeared generally better in DNA repair deficiency (DRD) + versus DRD– tumors with respect to PSA responses (33% vs. 0%; P=0.14), ORR (40% vs. 0%; P=0.46), PSA-PFS (HR 0.19; P<0.01), PFS (HR 0.31; p=0.01), and OS (HR 0.41; P=0.11). No new safety concerns were observed and
the most common toxicities were fatigue, AST elevation, diarrhea and anorexia. Seventeen grade 
3-4 adverse events occurred in 7 of 15 patients (46%). There were no treatment-related deaths.
Given that nivolumab in combination with ip ilimumab appears to be active in patients with 
mCRPC and existing data have shown that anti-CTLA-4 therapy can enhance immune cell 
infiltration into prostate tumors and increase PD-L1 expression,
62the addition of Cohort D in this
study will explore two different dosing schedules of nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab
to identify a dose combination which reduces to xicity and increases the potential clinical benefit 
from dual checkpoint inhibition.  
 
1.1.5 Rationale to Support Nivolumab plus Ipilimumab Dose and Schedule 
Selection for Cohorts A, B, and C
The nivolumab plus ipilimumab combination dosing regimen selected for evaluation in Cohorts 
A, B, and C of this study is nivolumab 1 mg/ kg combined with ipilimumab 3 mg/kg administered 
every 3 weeks (Q3W) for 4 doses. The nivolumab plus ipilimumab combination dosing regimen will be followed by 480 mg flat dose of nivolumab every 4 weeks (Q4W) until progression of 
disease, unacceptable toxicity, or subject withdrawal of consent.
Multiple doses (ranging from 0.5 to 10 mg/kg as either monotherapy or in combination studies) and schedules (ranging from a single dose of ipilimumab to recurring doses every 3 weeks for four 
cycles) were evaluated in several Phase 1/2 trials of ipilimumab in CRPC.

endpoints varied am ongst the studies, ipilimumab showed clinical activity in CRPC with PSA 
responses ( ≥50% decline) across doses of 3, 5, and 10 mg/kg administered as monotherapy.43
Declines in PSA were consisten tly noted (15–20%) at doses of ≥3 mg/kg with varying patterns of 
PSA response including at treatment onset, after a short period of stable disease, late responses 
after 6 months of treatment ), as well as PSA responses observed after an init ial PSA rise within 
6m o n t h s .43All trials utilized the Prostate Cancer Working Group 2 (PCWG2) criteria.63
Exposure-response analysis of nivolumab monothera py have been performed across dose ranges 
of 1 mg/kg to 10 mg/kg and show a relatively flat dose-response r elationship for safety and efficacy 
in most tumor types evaluated (except for non-small cell lung cancer/NSCLC).64Minimum serum 
concentration after first dose (Cmin1) produced by 3 mg/kg nivolumab was not a significant 
predictor of probability of overall response in treatment refractory squamous non-small cell lung 
cancer (NSCLC), and advanced melanoma. Nivolu mab steady state time-averaged concentration 
(Cavgss) was not a significant predictor of hazard of death in subjects with advanced RCC after 
accounting for the effect of nivolumab clearance (CL). Clinical prognostic factors such as sex, 
baseline Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center risk score, baseline Karnofsky performance status, and baseline weight, were significant predictors of OS in subjects with advanced RCC. The 
risk of time to first Grade 3+ drug-related AEs and AEs leading to discontinuation did not increase 
with Cavgss produced by doses ranging from 0.1 to 10 mg/kg nivolumab, and at 3 mg/kg dose in advanced melanoma. (Subjects with NSCLC appeared to have a higher risk of AEs leading to 
discontinuation than subjects with other tumor types including melanoma).

Exposure-response relations hips of ipilimumab monotherapy for efficacy (ie, overall survival, OS) 
and safety (ie, immune-related adverse events, irAEs) were characterized using data from 4 Phase 
2 studies (CA184004, CA184007, CA184008, and CA184022) and 1 Phase 3 st udy (CA 184024) 
in subjects with advanced melanoma.65In contrast to nivolumab, OS increased with increasing 
ipilimumab steady state trough concentration (Cminss) over the range of exposures achieved with 
both the 3- and 10-mg/kg doses.66Exposure-response analysis of escalating doses (0.3 mg/kg, 
3 mg/kg, and 10 mg/kg) of ipilimumab monotherapy have demonstrated increasing activity with 
increase in dose in the phase 2 study CA184022.67The probability of experiencing Grade ≥2 and 
≥3 irAEs also increased with increasing ipilimumab Cminss.65
Hence, to balance the concern of potential toxicity due to the combination of 2 checkpoint 
inhibitors, the lowest  clinically active ipilimumab dose of 3 mg/kg was chosen in combination 
with nivolumab dose of 1 mg/kg (given the somewhat flat dose-response relationship noted with nivolumab across the dose range of 1 to 10 mg/kg). Accordingly nivolumab 1 mg/kg plus 
ipilimumab 3 mg/kg will be evaluated within 2 cohorts of metastatic castration-resistant metastatic 
prostate cancer subjects (mCRPC).
1.1.6 Rationale to Support Dose and Schedule Selection in Cohort D

combination regimens were selected with the objective to improve the tolerability profile and to

maintain or improve the efficacy observed from pre liminary results from Cohorts B and C. The 
inclusion of the ipilimumab  monotherapy arm will s upport assessment of the contribution of 
ipilimumab to the nivolumab + ipilimumab combination, particularly in biomarker-defined sub-
groups which were not evaluated in prior ipilimumab studies in mCRPC.
1.1.6.1 Arm D1 Rationale for Combina tion Regimen (nivolumab 3 mg/kg plus 
ipilimumab 1 mg/kg)
The combination regimen is nivolumab 3mg/kg plus ipilimumab 1 mg/kg given every three weeks 
(Q3W) (N3I1) for up to 4 cy cles, followed by nivolumab 480 mg every four weeks (Q4W) starting 
three weeks after the last combination dose for up to 2 years or until disease progression. This
combination regimen is currently  approved in the US to treat 1L RCC and MSI-High or dMMR 
mCRC.68The nivolumab dose is higher and the ipilimumab dose is lower in this regimen compared 
to the regimen evaluated in Cohorts A, B, and C, and has shown activity in AR-V7 mCRPC,69
with a manageable safety profile as described in Section 1.1.4 . Further support for the N3I1 
regimen having an improved safe ty profile comes from the metastatic RCC setting in study 
CA209016  and the metastatic melanoma setti ng, where the safety profile of 
N3I1 Q3W and N1I3 Q3W, followed by 480 mg Q4W nivolu mab maintenance were compared in 
clinical study CA209511.70N3I1 demonstrated a reduced r ate of drug-r elated Grade 3-4 AEs 
compared with N1I3, with rates of 33.3 % (60/180) and 48.3% (86/178), respectively.
1.1.6.2 Arm D2 Rationale for Combina tion Regimen (nivolumab 1mg/kg Q3W 
(8 Doses) plus ipilimumab 3 mg/kg Q6W (4 Doses)
The combination regimen is nivolumab 1 mg/kg every 3 weeks plus ipilimumab 3 mg/kg every 
2 cycles (ie, every 6 weeks) for up to 4 ipilimumab doses, followed by nivolumab 480 mg every 4 weeks, starting six weeks after the last ipilimumab combination dose for up to 2 years or un til 
disease progression. This combination regimen maintains the nivolumab and ipilimumab dose to 
that of the regimen in Cohorts A, B, and C, but lowers the ipilimumab time-averaged concentration 
(Cavgss) by ~ 2-fold by extending the dosing interval from Q3W to Q6W. A prior clinical study in advanced NSCLC (CA209012) supports the rationale to decrease ipilimumab dosing frequency to improve tolerabili ty, while maintaining efficacy. Promising clinical activity with a favorable 
safety profile was observed in cohort P (nivolum ab 3 mg/kg Q2W+ ipilimumab 1 mg/kg Q12W, 
ORR 47.4 % [18/38]) and cohort Q (nivolumab 3 mg/kg Q2W+ ipilimumab 1 mg/kg Q6W, ORR 38.5 % [15/39]) in CA209-012. A notable improvement in drug-related AEs leading to discontinuation was observed in cohorts P (15.8 %, 6/38) and Q (17.9%, 7/39) compared to the 
combination nivolumab 3 mg/kg + ipilimumab 1 mg/kg Q3W for 4 cycles, followed by nivolumab 
3 mg/kg Q2W (40%, 10/25).

1.1.6.3 Arm D3 Rationale for Ipilimumab 3 mg/kg Q3W
The ipilimumab monotherapy arm will be dosed at 3 mg/kg Q3W for 4 cycles with no maintenance 
dosing. This is the approved ipilimumab dose for metastatic melanoma and, as described in 
Section 1.1.4 above, has shown some clinical activity as measured by PSA response in prior 
studies where ipilimumab monotherapy at this dose was evaluated in mCRPC (CA184009, CA184019, and CA184017). Arm D3 will provide an  estimation of the relativ e benefit of the

1.1.6.4 Arm D4 Rationale for Cab azitaxel in Prostate Cancer
Taxanes bind microtubules, promoting their stabilization and preventing cellular mitosis and 
division. Additionally, taxanes inhibit androgen receptor (AR) signaling by binding cellular 
microtubules and the microtubule-associated motor protein dynein, and consequently preventing 
AR nuclear translocation.72Docetaxel, a second-generation s emisynthetic taxane analog, became 
the first chemotherapeutic agent to show an OS benefit in mCRPC in two randomized controlled 
clinical trials (TAX 32773and SWOG 99-1674), and was approved in combination with prednisone 
for this indication in the US in 2004. 
Cabazitaxel is another taxane-based chemotherapy that was approved by the FDA in 2010 for 
patients with mCRPC previously treated with docetaxel.75Cabazitaxel retains significant 
cytotoxicity in docetaxel-resistant cell lines due to p-glyc oprotein 1 (gp-1) overexpression. 
Another attractive property of cab azitaxel is its enhanced solubility in water-based solutions 
compared with other taxanes, enabling better blood–brain barrier penetration, resulting in higher 
central nervous system drug concentrations with systemic administration in mouse models. In the TROPIC study, 755 men with mCRPC who previ ously received docetaxel chemotherapy were 
randomized to receive either cabazitaxel 25 mg/ m
2(n = 378) or mitoxantrone 12 mg/m2(n = 377) 
every 3 weeks for a maximum of 10 cycles, c oncurrently with prednisone 10 mg daily.76At the 
first interim analysis, with a median follow up of 12.7 months, median overall survival was 15.1 months for the cabazitax el group versus 12.7 months for the mitoxantrone group, corresponding 
to a 30% reduction in relative risk of death (hazard ratio 0.70, 95% confidence inte rval 0.59–0.83, 
p < 0·0001). Other clinical endpoints, including PSA response (39.2% v 17.8%, re spectively; 
P < .001), PFS (2.8 v 1.4 months, respectively; P < .001), objective tumor response (14.4% vs 4.4% respectively; P < .001) and pain progression all fa vored the cabazitaxel tr eatment arm. The 
most common toxic effects of cabazitaxel were hematological; the most frequent hematological 
grade 3 or higher adverse events were neutropenia, leukopenia, and anemia. The most common 
non-hematological grade 3 or higher adverse event was diarrhea. Overall, peripheral neuropathy 
(all grades) was reported in 14% of patients, but G3 peripheral neuropathy was uncommon (1%). Peripheral edema (all grades) occurred in 9% of patients treated with cabazitaxel. An updated 
analysis 2 years after the original TROPIC d ata cutoff (March 2012) confirmed a sustained 
survival benefit with longer follow up, with cab azitaxel treatment being predictive of survival over 
2 years.

Randomization to a cabazitaxel arm in Cohort D is included as a reference for the immunotherapy 
arms in the cohort.

1.1.7 Rationale for Shorter Infusion Times for Nivolumab and Ipilimumab
Long infusion times place a burden on patients and treatment centers. Establishing that nivolumab 
and ipilimumab can be safely administered using shorter i nfusion times of 30 minutes’ duration 
will dimin ish the burden, provided that there is no change in the safety profile. Previous clinical 
studies of nivolumab and ipilimumab monotherapi es and the combination of nivolumab and 
ipilimumab have used a 60-minute infusion duration for nivolumab and a 90-minute infusion 
duration for ipilimumab (1 - 3 mg/kg dosing for bot h). However, both nivolumab and ipilimumab 
have been administered at up to 10 mg/kg with the same infusion duration (ie, 60 minutes).
Establishing that nivolumab can be safely administered using a shorter infusion time (30 minutes) 
is under investigation. Previous clinical studies of nivolumab monotherapy have used a 60-minute infusion duration wherein, nivolumab has been safely administered up to 10 mg/kg over long 
treatment periods. Infusion r eactions including high-grade hypersensitivity reactions have been 
uncommon across nivolumab clinical program. In CA209010, a dose association was observed for infusion site reactions and hypersensitivity reactions (1.7% at 0.3 m g/kg, 3.7% at 2 mg/kg and 
18.5% at 10 mg/kg). All the events were Grade 1-2 and were manageable. An infusion duration of 30 minutes for 3 mg/kg nivolumab  (30% of the dose provided at 10 mg/kg) is not expected to 
present any safety concerns compared to the prior experience at 10 mg/kg nivolumab dose infused over a 60-minute duration. The safety of nivolumab  3 mg/kg administered as a 30-min infusion 
was assessed in CA209153 in patients (n = 322) with previously treated advanced NSCLC. Overall, there were no clinically meaningful  differences in the frequency of 
hypersensitivity/infus ion-related r eactions (of any cause or tr eatment-related) in patients 
administered nivolumab over a 30-minute infusion compared with that re ported for patients with 
the 60-minute infusion. Thus, it was shown that nivolumab can be safely infused over 30 minutes. 
Similarly, ipilimumab at 10 mg/kg has been safely administered over 90 minutes. In subjects with 
advanced Stage II or Stage IV melanoma (CA 184022 Study), where ipilimumab was administered 
up to a dose of 10 mg/kg, on-study drug related hypersensitivity events (Grade 1/2) were reported 
in 1 subject (1.4%) in the 0.3 mg/kg and in 2 subjects (2.8%) in the 10 mg/kg group. There were no drug-related hypersensitivity events re ported in the 3 mg/kg group. Across the 3 treatment 
groups, no Grade 3/4 drug-related hypersensitivity events were reported and there were no reports of infusion reactions. Ipilimumab 10 mg/kg monotherapy has also been safely administered as a 90-minute infusion in a large Phase 3 study in prostate cancer (CA184043) and as adjuvant therapy for Stage III melanoma (CA184029), with infusion reactions occurring in subjects. Administering 
3 mg/kg of ipilimumab represents approximately one-third of the 10 mg/kg dose.
Overall, infusion reactions including high-grade hypersensitivity reactions have been uncommon 
across clinical studies of nivolumab, ipilimumab, and nivolumab/ipilimumab combinations. Furthermore, a 30-minute break after the first i nfusion for the combinatio n cohort will ensure the 
appropriate safety monitoring before the start of the second i nfusion. Overall, a ch ange in safety 
profile is not anticipated with 30 -minute infusions of nivolumab, ipilimumab or combination.

1.1.8 Rationale for Flat Dose 480 mg Nivolumab every 4 weeks (Nivolumab 
Monotherapy Phase)
Nivolumab monotherapy has been extensively studied in a number of tumor types including 
non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), melano ma, renal cell carcino ma (RCC), and colorectal 
cancer (CRC) with body weight normalized dosing (mg/kg). Nivolumab pharmacokinetics (PK) 
and exposures of subjects in these studies have been characterized by population pharmacokinetic (PPK) analysis of data collected together with PK data from several Phase 1, 2, and 3 clinical studies of nivolumab monotherapy in solid tumors. PPK analyses have shown that the PK of nivolumab are linear, with do se proportional exposure s over a dose range of 0.1 mg/kg to 
10 mg/kg, and are similar across tumor types. Nivolumab clearance and volume of distribution were found to increase with increasing body weight, but the increase was less than proportional, 
indicating that a mg/kg dose represents an over-adjustment for the effect of body weight on nivolumab PK. Given the relationship between nivolumab PK and body weight, a flat dose is 
expected to lead to lower e xposures in heavier sub jects, relative to th e exposures in li ghter subjects. 
Using the PPK model, nivolumab s teady-state trough, peak and time -averaged concentration 
(Cminss, Cmaxss, and Cavgss, respectively) were predicted for a flat nivolumab dose of 240 mg 
Q2W and compared to those following administration of 3 mg/kg Q2W in NSCLC, melanoma, 
and RCC subjects. A dose of 240 mg nivolumab is ident ical to a dose of 3 mg/kg for sub jects 
weighing ~ 80 kg, which is the approximate median body weight of subjects in the Phase 2 and 3 
BMS clinical studies of nivolumab monotherapy. Usi ng a PPK model, the overall distributions of 
nivolumab exposures (Cavgss, Cminss, Cmaxss, and Cmin1) are comparable after treatment with 
either 3 mg/kg or 240 mg nivolumab. The predicted range of nivolumab exposures (median and 
90% prediction intervals) resulting from a 240 mg flat dose across the 35 to 160 kg weight range 
is maintained well below the corresponding exposur es observed with the well tolerated 10 mg/kg 
nivolumab Q2W dosage. Given the similarity of nivolumab PK across tumor types and the similar 
exposures predicted following administration of a 240 mg flat dose compared to 3 mg/kg, it is 
expected that the safety and efficacy profile of nivolumab following a flat dose will be similar to 
that of 3 mg/kg nivolumab dose.
Across the various tumor types in the BMS clinical pr ogram, nivolumab has been shown to be safe 
and well tolerated up to a dose level of 10 mg/kg, and the r elationship between nivolumab exposure 
produced by 3 mg/kg and efficacy has been found to be relatively fl at. Taken together, the PK, 
safety, and efficacy data indicate that the safety and efficacy profile of flat nivolumab dose every 
2 weeks will be similar to that of a 3 mg/kg nivolumab every 2 weeks.
While 480 mg Q4W is predicted to provide greater (approximately 40%) maximum steady state 
concentrations and lower (approximately 15 to 20%) steady state trough concentrations, these 
exposures are predicted to be within the exposure ranges observed at doses up to 10 mg/kg Q2W used in the Phase 1 nivolumab clinical program, and are not considered to put subjects at increased 
risk. Similar to the nivolumab Q2W dosing monotherapy regimen, the exposures predicted following administration of nivolumab 480 mg Q4W, are on the flat part of the exposure-response curves for previously investigated tumors, melanoma and NSCLC, and are not predicted to affect

efficacy. Based on these data, nivolumab 480 mg Q4W is expected to have similar efficacy and 
safety profiles to nivolumab 3 mg/kg Q2W.
In this study, subjects will receive flat dose 480 mg nivolumab every 4 weeks (Q4W), which 
provides a more convenient dosing regimen for subjects. Subjects Arm D1 will start nivolumab 
monotherapy 3 weeks after the last combinat ion dose, while s ubjects in Arm D2 will start 
nivolumab monotherapy 6 weeks after the last combination dose.
Hence, doubling the dose of nivolumab from 240 mg  to 480 mg would extend the dosing interval 
from 2 weeks to 4 weeks.Thus, a flat dose of 480 mg every 4 weeks is r ecommended for investigation in the nivolumab 
monotherapy phase of this study.
1.1.9 Rationale for Shorter Infusion Times with 480 mg Flat Dosing
Long infusion times place a burden on subjects and treatment centers. Establishing that nivolumab 
can be safely administered using shorter i nfusion times of  30 minutes duration in subjects w ill 
diminish the burden provided th ere is no change in safety profile. Previous clinical studies show 
that nivolumab has been administered safely over 60 minutes at doses ranging up to 10 mg/kg over long treatment duration. For example, in  Study CA209010 (a Phase 2, randomized, 
double-blinded, dose-ranging study of nivolumab in subjects with advanced/metastatic, clear cell RCC), a dose association was observed for infusion site r eactions and hypersensitivity r eactions 
(1.7% at 0.3 mg/kg, 3.7% at 2 mg/kg and 18.5% at 10 mg/kg). All the events were Grade 1/2 and were manageable. Establishing that nivolumab can be safely administered using a shorter infusion time (30 minutes) is under investigation. The safety  of nivolumab 3 mg/kg administered as a 
30-min infusion was assessed in CA209153 in subjects with previously treated advanced NSCLC. 
Overall, there were no clinically meaningful  differences in the frequency of 
hypersensitivity/infusio n-related reactions (of any cause or tr eatment-related) in subjects 
administered nivolumab over a 30 min infusion compared with that reported for subjects with the 
60 min infusion. An infusion duration of 30 minutes for 1 mg/kg nivolumab and nivolumab 
480 mg is not expected to present any safety concerns compared to  the prior experience at 
10 mg/kg nivolumab dose infused over a 60-minute duration. 
1.1.10 Rationale for Evaluating Chemotherapy-Naive, Second-Generation 
Hormone Therapy-Naive, Asymptomatic or Minimally Symptomatic 
Metastatic CPRC Subjects (Cohort A Subjects)
Docetaxel became the first approved therapy to prolong survival for men with mCRPC in 
2004.
13,14Subsequently, since 2010, six nov el therapies have been shown to prolong survival in 
men with mCRPC.78The trials have demonstrated prolongation of over all survival as w ell as 
trends toward preserved quality of life (QoL), albeit less ri gorously assessed and documented.79
Of note, all these new therapies in mCRPC have distinct mechanisms of action and include unique 
classes of agents: novel androgen receptor (AR) pathway inhibitors abiraterone acetate 
(abiraterone) and enzalutamide as well as a bone targeting alpha-emitting radionuclide,

radium-223 chloride (radium-223), taxanes, do cetaxel and cabazitaxel, and sipuleucel-T, an 
immunotherapeutic agent.
Of the six new therapies that have been approved since 2010 for mCRPC, sipuleucel-T has been 
tested predominantly (~85%) in chemotherapy-naïv e men with mCRPC and showed no effect on 
response rates or progressi on free survi val (PFS).27More recently, two second-generation 
hormone therapies, abiraterone acetate10and enzalutamide9targeting inhibition of the androgen 
receptor (AR) signaling pathway have been investigated and shown to prolong overall survival in 
large phase III trials in minimally symptoma tic subjects in the pre- docetaxel states. See Table 
1.1.10-1 . Enzalutamide also extended time to radiogr aphic progression and death as well as 
improved overall survival in men with mCRPC prior to r eceiving chemotherapy.9Delay in time 
to chemotherapy was also reported.9Similar to enzalutamide, abiraterone was also shown to delay 
radiographic progression and time to chemotherapy in men with mCRPC.10Despite the success of 
these second-generation AR-targeted therapies,  inherent or acquired resistance remains a major 
clinical challenge and most subjects will progress.80Clinical data from a number of small 
retrospective cohort studies suggests that once subjects progress response rates to abiraterone after enzalutamide and conversely enzalutamide after ab iraterone are low and no robust criteria exist 
clinically to select one drug rather than the other.
81,82The presence of androgen receptor sp lice 
variants without the ligand-binding domain has been associated with resistance to abiraterone and 
enzalutamide and could be one explanation for this significant cross-resistance.83Docetaxel after 
one or both of newer AR pathway inhibitors may have less activity than in the pivotal trials.84
Thus there is still an unmet need in mCRPC for tr eatment op tions that will provide durable disease 
control and long term survival.

While the successful registration of several drugs for mCRPC provided new options for treatment, 
they have also led to considerable uncertainty  as to the best treatment choices, sequence of 
treatment options and appropriate patient selection with the achiev ement of durable, long term 
responses remaining an elusive goal.
In daily practice, clinicians often face the difficult task of choosing among treatment options with 
different mechanisms of action, ad ministration and toxicity profiles and the desire to tailor novel 
treatment options to the sp ecific needs of the individual mCRPC subjects.85The first St Gallen 
Advanced Prostate Cancer Consensus Conference (APCCC) Expert Panel reviewed the available evidence for the ten most important areas of controversy in advanced prostate cancer (APC) 
management to provide management recommendations based on expert opinion in these 
situations .
79Of note, for subjects with mCRPC in the absence of symptoms and imminent 
complications, two-thirds of the APCCC panel recommended that agents with potential for survival prolongation should be initiated within 4–8 weeks.
79
Although 2 Phase 3 studies of ipilimumab monotherapy in pre- and post-docetaxel mCRPC 
(CA184095 and CA184043, respectively) failed to show an overall survival advantage, additional analyses of outcome data from both studies are im portant to consider (See  Section 1.1.10 ), given 
the understanding that (i) currently available therapies do not result in durable, long term remissions in mCRPC subjects and (ii) emerging data from other solid tumors that have been 
studied, notably, melanoma, the use of checkpoint blockade inhibition suggests the potential for 
prolonged duration of res ponse with immunotherapy in a subset of subjects.
86
As noted previously in  Section 1.1.5 , ipilimumab has been shown to induce an adaptive immune 
response within the prostate tumor microenvironment.87In a clinical trial, subjects with localized 
prostate cancer who were treated with ADT plus 2 doses of anti-CTLA4 antibody (ipilimumab) 
observed an increased frequency of CD4 and CD 8 T cell infiltr ation into tumor tissues and 
increased expression of PD-1 and PD-L1 (on both immune and epithelial cells).87These findings 
suggest that while tr eatment with ipilimumab re sulted in expected immune augmentation, it was 
also associated with the induction of immune inhibitory PD-1/PD-L1 pathway. These preliminary clinical data provide a potential explanation as to  why a significant proportion of subjects with 
prostate cancer did not benefit from tr eatment with ipilimumab or nivolumab monotherapy. 
Accordingly, utilizing a combination checkpoint bl ockade inhibition approach, with anti-CTLA4 
and anti-PD-1 antibodies may be necessary to augment T cell res ponses for greater anti-tumor 
activity in prostate cancer.
Taken together these data suggest that in m CRPC subjects the activity of ipilimumab monotherapy 
could potentially be strongly enhanced by the comb ination with another checkpoint inhibitor to 
result in durable anti-tumor responses. And asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic mCRPC subjects who are early on in the disease state of mCRPC may in fact be optimal candidates for the evaluation of combination of checkpoint blockade inhibitors, ipilimumab and nivolumab, with the possibility of achieving long ter m remission from disease.

Addendum:
Cohort A enrollment was discontinued in Revised P rotocol 02 due to slow accrual and to reflect 
the changing landscape of metastati c castration-resistant prostate cancer. 
Both enzalutamide and abiraterone are currently approved for the treatment of patients with 
mCRPC who have not received chemotherapy. These drugs, which have now become the standard 
of care in this setti ng, have a well-established safety profile and have demonstrated OS 
improvement and delay of radiographic disease progression and need for cytotoxic 
chemotherapy.9,10,88Furthermore, the addition of abiraterone to first-line ADT resulted in a 
significant improvement in OS in men with prostate cancer, according to recently reported results from the LATITUDE 
89and STAMPEDE 90clinical trials. The abiraterone/prednisone/ADT arm 
had a 38% reduction in risk of death when compared  to the control in the LATITUDE trial (OS: 
not reached vs. 34.7 months , HR: 0.62, 95% CI: 0.51-0.76; P<0.0001). The 3-year OS rate was 
66% in the abiraterone arm versus 49% in the placebo arm. Overall survival benefit persisted 
across all of the pre-specified subgroups. In the Phase 3 STAMPEDE trial, ADT plus abiraterone 
and prednisolone was associated with significantly higher rates of overall survival (HR: 0.63, 95% 
CI: 0.52-0.76; P=0.001) and f ailure-free survival (HR: 0.29; 95% CI, 0.25 to 0.34; P<0.001) than 
ADT alone among men with locally advanced or metastatic prostate cancer. 
Thus, the use of abiraterone is expected to continue expanding in earlier settings of the prostate 
cancer treatment landscape and eligibility criteria for participation in Cohort A are anticipated to 
be less relevant in future practice due to changes in standard of care.
This trial will now include 2 cohorts in mCRPC, Cohorts B and C, and the remainder of Cohort A 
subjects will be allo cated to Arms B and C in order to have more precise efficacy estimates in 
those arms.
1.1.11 Rationale for Treatment Beyond PSA Elevation
For consistency of trial reporting, the PCWG2 defines PSA progression as the date that an increase 
of 25% or more and an absolute increase of 2 ng/mL or more from the nadir are documented.8For 
subjects who had an initial PSA decline during tr eatment, this must be confirmed by a second 
value 3 or more weeks later. However, PSA progression alone is not necessarily an indication to 
stop treatment, because in some cases, PSA levels may  rise slowly or stabilize after an initial rise 
with no other sign of clinical progression.91Because there are cases in which additional years of 
disease control would not have been realized had therapy been stopped on the basis of PSA change 
alone, therapy will not  be stopped for subjects with apparent PSA progression alone. However, 
subjects meeting criteria for discontinuation of therapy ( Section 3.5 ) and PSA elevation will come 
off study.
1.1.12 Rationale for Optional Crossover Combination for Monotherapy Arms 
(Arm D3 and D4)
In some cancer types, combined blockade of both PD-1 and CTLA-4 has proven more efficacious 
than inhibition of either pathway alone. Furthermore, preliminary data with nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab have shown promising clinical activity in mCRPC

the monotherapy Arms D3 and D4 the option to receive nivolumab in combination with 
ipilimumab in Arm D1 upon BICR-confirmed radiographic progression and provided that such 
crossover treatment is discussed with and approved by the BMS Medical Monitor.
1.1.13 Rationale for Duration of Treatment with Nivolumab plus Ipilimumab
The optimal duration of immunotherapy is an important question and continues to be investigated.  
Clinical trials across different tumors types in the nivolumab and ipilimumab development 
program indicate that most of the re sponses occur early, with a median time to response of 2-4 
months, and emerging data suggests that benefit can be maintained in the absence of continued 
treatment.  A recent analysis in  a melanoma study suggests the majority of patients who 
discontinue nivolumab and/or ipilimumab for toxicity maintain disease control in the absence of 
further treatment.92Furthermore, a limited duration of ipilimumab, including only 4 induction 
doses, resulted in long term survival in patients with metas tatic melanoma, with a sustained plateau 
in survival starting around 2 years after the start of treatment.93
Accumulating data suggest that 2 years of PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor treatment may be sufficient 
for long term benefit. CA209003, a dose-escalation cohort expansion trial evaluating the safety 
and clinical activity of nivo lumab in patients with previously  treated advanced solid tumors 
(including 129 subjects with NSCLC), specified a maximum tr eatment duration of 2 years.  Among 
16 subjects with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who discontinued nivolumab after completing 2 years of treatment, 12 subjects were alive >5 years and remained progression-free without any subsequent therapy. In the CA209003 NSCLC cohort, the overall survival (OS) curve 
begins to plateau after 2 years, with an OS rate of 25% at 2 years and 18% at 3 years.
94.These 
survival outcomes are similar to phase 3 studies in previously treated NSCLC, in which nivolumab 
treatment was continued until progression or unacceptab le toxicity (2 year OS rates of 23% and 
29%, and 3 year OS rates of 16%-18% for squamous and non-squamous NSCLC respectively).95
Similar re sults have been reported in clinical studies of pembrolizumab, another PD-1 inhibitor. 
Keynote-010 was a randomized phase 3 trial of pembrolizumab (at either 2 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg 
every 3 weeks) versus docetaxel in subjects wi th previously treated, PD-L1-positive, advanced 
NSCLC which specified a  maximum treatment duration of 2 years for pembrolizumab. OS was 
significantly longer with both pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg (HR 0.72, p = 0.00017) and pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg (HR 0.60, p < 0.00001) compared to docetaxel, with an OS plateau developing beyond 2 years in both pembrolizumab arms. Amo ng 690 patients who received pembrolizumab, 
47 patients completed 2 years of pembrolizumab and stopped treatment. Most were able to 
maintain their response, including those with stab le disease, with only 2 patients (4%) having 
confirmed progression after stopping at 2 years.
96
Keynote-006 was a randomized phase 3 study of pembrolizumab versus ipilimumab in patients with advanced melanoma, which also specified a maximum 2 year duration of pembrolizumab 
treatment. 104 (19%) of 556 patients randomized to pembrolizumab completed 2 years of

treatment. With a median follow-up of 9 months after completion of pembrolizumab, the estimated 
risk of progression or death was 9% in these patients.97
Taken together, these data suggest that treatment beyond 2 years is unlikely to confer additional 
clinically meaningful benefit and that the risk  of progression after discontinuing treatment at 
2 years is low.
In contrast, a shorter duration of nivolumab of only 1 year was associated with increased risk of 
progression in previously tr eated patients with NSCLC, s uggesting that treatment be yond 1 year 
is likely needed. In CA209153, patients with previously treated advanced NSCLC who completed 1 year of nivolumab therapy were randomized to either continue or stop treatment, with the option 
of retreatment upon progression. Amo ng 163 patients still on tr eatment at 1 year and without 
progression, those who were randomized to continue nivolumab had significant improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) compared to thos e who were randomized to  stop treatment, with 
median PFS (post-randomi zation) not reached vs 10.3 months, respectively; HR=0.42 (95% CI, 
0.25 to 0.71). With a median follow-up of 14.9 months post-randomization, there also was a trend for patients on continued treatment to live longer (OS HR = 0.63 [95% CI: 0.33, 1.20]). Of note, the PFS curves in both groups plateau approximately 1 y ear after rando mization (i.e ., 2 years after 
treatment initiation), suggesting that there may be minimal benefit in extending treatment beyond 
a total of 2 years.
98
Collectively, these data suggest that there is minimal if any benefit derived from continuing I-O 
treatment beyond two years in advanced tumors. However, even though immunotherapy is well 
tolerated, patients will be at risk for additional toxicity with l onger term tr eatment. There fore, in 
this study, treatment will be given for a maximum of 2 years from the start of study tr eatment for 
subjects in Cohort D. 
It is strongly recommended that subjects in Cohorts A, B, and C limit tr eatment duration with 
immunotherapy treatment for up to 2 years. For subjects in these cohorts who receive 
immunotherapy treatment beyond 2 years, treatmen t will be given for a maximum of 5 years from 
the start of study treatment.

Treatment with nivolumab combined with ipilimumab will have clinical activity in subjects with

1.4 Product Development Background
Cancer immunotherapy rests on the premise that tumors  can be recognized as foreign rather than 
as self and can be effectively attacked by an activated immune system. An effective immune 
response in this setting is thought to rely on immune surveillance of tumor antigens expressed on 
cancer cells that ultimately results in an  adaptive immune response and cancer cell death. 
Meanwhile, tumor progression may depend upon acquisition of traits that allow cancer cells to

evade immunosurveillance and escape effective innate and adaptive immune responses.99,100,101
Current immunotherapy efforts attempt to br eak the apparent tolerance of the immune system to 
tumor cells and antigens by eith er introducing cancer antigens by therapeutic vaccination or by 
modulating regulatory checkpoints of the immune system.
1.4.1 Mechanism of Action of Nivolumab
PD-1 is a member of the CD28 family of T-cell co -stimulatory receptors that also includes CD28, 
CTLA 4, ICOS, and BTLA.102PD-1 signaling has been shown to inhibit CD-28-mediated 
upregulation of IL-2, IL- 10, IL-13, interferon γ  (IFN γ) and Bcl-xL. PD-1 expression also been 
noted to inhibit T cell activation, and expansi on of previously activated cells. Evidence for a 
negative regulatory role of PD-1 comes from studies of PD-1 deficient mice, which develop a 
variety of autoimmune phenotypes.103These results suggest that PD-1 blockade has the potential 
to activate anti-self T-cell responses, but these responses are variable and dependent upon various 
host genetic factors. Thus, PD-1 deficiency or inhibition is not accompanied by a universal loss of 
tolerance to self-antigens.
In vitro, nivolumab binds to PD-1 with high affinity (EC50 0.39-2.62 nM), and inhibits the binding 
of PD-1 to its ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2 (IC50 < 1 nM). BMS-936558 binds specifically to PD-1 
and not to related members of the CD28 family such as CD28, ICOS, CTLA-4 and BTLA. Blockade of the PD-1 pathway by nivolumab  results in a reproducible enhancement of both 
proliferation and IFN- γ release in the mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR). Using a CMV 
re stimulation assay with human Peripheral Blood Mononuclear cells (PBMC), the effect of nivolumab on antigen specific recall response indicates that nivolumab augmented IFN- γ secretion 
from CMV specific memory T cells in a dose-depende nt manner versus isotype-matched control. 
In vivo blockade of PD-1 by a murine analog of nivolumab enhances the anti-tumor immune response and result in tumor rejection in several immunocompetent mouse tumor models (MC38, 
SA1/N, and PAN02).
104
Immunotherapeutic approaches recently have demonstrated clinical eff icacy in several cancer
types, including melanoma, and NSCLC, and RCC.105,106,107,108Nivolumab (Opdivo ®)is 
approved in multiple countries including the US for treatment of previously treated, unresectable 
or metastatic melanoma and previously treated, m etastatic NSCLC, and advanced RCC.109
1.4.2 Mechanism of Action of Ipilimumab
CTLA-4, an activation-induced T-cell surface molecule, is a member of the CD28:B7 
immunoglobulin superfamily that competes with CD28 for B7. CTLA-4 mediated signals are 
inhibitory and turn off T cell-dependent immune responses.110,111
Ipilimumab is a fully human monoclonal IgG1 κ that binds to the CTLA-4 antigen expressed on a 
subset of T cells from human and nonhuman pr imates. The proposed mechanism of action for 
ipilimumab is interference of the interaction of CTLA-4 with B7 molecules on APCs, with subsequent blockade of the inhibitory modulat ion of T-cell activation promoted by the CTLA 4/B7 
interaction.

1.4.3 Nivolumab-plus-Ipilimumab Mechanism of Action
Preclinical and clinical data indicate that the combination of PD-1 and CTLA-4 receptor blockade 
may improve antitumor activity. In vitro combinati ons of nivolumab plus ip ilimumab increase 
IFN-γproduction 2- to 7-fold over either agent alone in a mixed lymphocyte reaction. In a murine 
melanoma vaccine model, blockade with either CTLA-4 or PD-1 antibodies increased the proportion of CTLA-4- and PD -1-expressing CD4/CD8 tumor-infiltrating T effector cells, and 
dual blockade increased tumor infiltration of  T effector cells and decreased intratumoral
T regulatory cells, as compared to either agent alone.
112
In the Phase 1 dose escalation Study CA209004, the combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab
has been studied in subjects with unresectable or metastatic melanoma. In this study, a safe dose
level for the combination of ipilimumab and nivolumab was established for the treatment of
advanced melanoma. At this dose level, 3 mg/kg ipilimumab plus 1 mg/kg nivolumab, an ORR of 
53% was observed. This dose level has been approved in subjects with advanced melanoma in the 
US based on the Phase 3 Study CA209067.113
1.4.4 Overview of Nivolumab and Ipilimumab Clinical Pharmacology
The clinical pharmacology profiling of the combina tion of nivolumab and ipilimumab together 
with an overview of the results of these analyses are summarized below. In addition, the Clinical 
Pharmacology Section of the product labels  for ipilimumab and nivolumab, as w ell as the 
investigational brochures, have additional details.114,115,116,117
1.4.4.1 Population Pharmacokinetics of Nivolumab
The PK, clinical activity, and safety of nivolu mab has been assessed in completed and ongoing 
Phase 1, 2, and 3 studies in adult subjects with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), melanoma, 
and renal cell carcinoma (RCC) in addi tion to other tumor types.118
The PK of nivolumab as monotherapy was characterized by PPK analysis. Nivolumab clearance 
increased with bas eline body weight, es timated glomerular f iltration (eGFR), and Eastern 
Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status > 0. The PPK analysis was performed using data from 1908 subjects who received nivol umab from the following studies: nivolumab 
monotherapy data from studies MDX- 1106-01, ONO-4538-01, ONO-4538- 02, MDX- 1106-03, 
CA209010, CA209063, and CA209037. Studies CA209004, CA209069, CA209066, and CA209067 provided PK data of nivolumab monotherapy as w ell as in combination with 
ipilimumab in the target population (advanced  melanoma) who received the proposed dosing 
regimens. The data from these studies also allowed for an evaluation of potential drug interactions between nivolumab and ipilimumab and of the effect of imm unogenicity on clearan ce. Thus, for 
this analysis, the covariates assessed included ADA status, baseline ECOG status, baseline eGFR, baseline body weight (BW), gender and co-administration of ipilimumab.
Co-administration with ipilimumab 3 mg/kg resulted in a modest increase in nivolumab CL of 
35% whereas coadministration with ipilimumab 1 mg/kg did not appear to have an effect on nivolumab CL. Presence of anti-nivolumab anti bodies increased nivolumab CL by 25%, consistent 
with prior findings. In subjects with an ECOG performance status of > 0, nivolumab CL was 22%

higher (based on median values). Male subjects had a median of 12% higher volume of distribution 
of central compartment (VC) than females. Ba seline body weight was identified as a signif icant 
covariate for both CL and VC and the magnitude of the effect of baseline eGFR on CL was not 
considered clinically relevant. Th e geometric mean CL, Vss, and terminal half-life of nivolumab 
were 9.83 mL/h, 7.62 L, and 24.1 days, respectively. When administered in combination, the CL 
of nivolumab was increased by 35%, whereas there was no effect on the clearance of ipilimumab.
1.4.4.2 Population Pharmacokinetics of Ipilimumab
The PPK of ipilimumab was evaluated using data from 1345 subjects in 4 Phase 2 studies with 
ipilimumab monotherapy (CA184004, CA184007, CA184008, and CA184022), as w ell as one 
Phase 1 study (CA209004), one Phase 2 study (CA209069) and one Phase 3 study (CA209067) 
with ipilimumab monotherapy and nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab. The ipilimumab 
data from CA209004, CA209069, and CA209067 are included as they p rovide ip ilimumab PK 
samples that were collected in combination with nivolumab in the target population. The data from 4 ipilimumab monotherapy studies (CA184004, CA184007, CA184008, and CA184022) were 
included in the PPK analysis, to enable the assessment of the potential nivolumab effect on 
ipilimumab PK.
The co-administration of ipilimumab (3 mg/kg) with nivolumab 0.3 mg/kg and nivolumab 
3.0 mg/kg resulted in minimal changes in ipilimumab CL (- 7.5% and 11%, respectiv ely); however, 
sample sizes at these doses were small. The CL of ipilimumab coadministered with 1 mg/kg nivolumab was estimated to be 1% higher (95% CI: 97.8 - 106) relative to the CL of ipilimumab monotherapy, demonstrating that ipilimumab CL is unaffected by co-administration of 1 mg/kg 
nivolumab. Ipilimumab CL was estimated to increase by 6% (95% CI: 96.5 - 115) in the presence 
of ipilimumab ADA, as measured by the drug tolerant (2nd generation) assay. This effect is not 
considered to be statist ically signif icant (95% CI includes 1). Ip ilimumab CL and VC increased 
with increasing baseline body weight, and ipilimumab CL increased with increasing baseline LDH.
1.4.4.3 Pharmacokinetics of Nivolumab and Ipilimumab
The PK of nivolumab and ipilimumab, when adminis tered in combination, were characterized by 
summary statistics of observed data from CA209004 and by PPK analyses using serum 
concentration data collected in studies CA209004, CA209069 and CA209067.
A dose-related increase in nivolumab peak and t rough concentrations was observed after the first 
dose in Study CA209004. Peak and trough concentrations after the first dose for 1 mg/kg of 
nivolumab in combination with 3 mg/kg of ipilimumab Q3W were in the range of 
18.1 - 21.5 μg/mL and 3.2 - 4.8 μg/mL, respectively. Ipilimumab peak concentrations at 3 mg/kg 
in combination with 1 mg/kg nivolumab after  the first dose were in the range of 63.5 - 68.5 μg/mL. 
Ipilimumab trough concentrations at 3 mg/kg in combination with 1 mg/kg nivolumab after the first dose were in the range of 9.8 - 11.9 μg/mL.

Overall, the safety profile of nivolumab monothe rapy is manageable and generally consistent 
across completed and ongoing clinical trials, with no maximum tolerated dose (MTD) reached up 
to 10 mg/kg. Most AEs were low- grade (Grades 1 to 2) with relatively few high-grade (Grades 3 
to 4) AEs related to study drug. There was no pattern in the incidence, severity, or causality of AEs with respect to nivolumab dose level.
A pattern of immune-r elated adverse events has been defined, for which management al gorithms 
have been developed; these are provided in Appendix 1 . Most high-grade events were manageable 
with the use of corticosteroids or hormone replacement therapy (e ndocrinopathies) as instructed

1.4.5.2 Ipilimumab Safety Summary
A pooled analysis of 14 phase I-III studies evaluating various doses of ip ilimumab in advanced 
melanoma demonstrated that 64.2% of subjects experienced an irAE of any grade.119The majority 
of irAEs were mild-moderate (grade 1-2) with d eath due to irAEs occurring in <1% of subjects. 
The skin and GI tract were most frequently affected, wh ile hep atic, endocrine, and neurologic 
events were less common.119In a phase II trial comparing three dose levels of ipilimumab 
(0.3 mg/kg, 3.0 mg /kg, and 10 mg/kg) in subjects who were pretreated for advanced melanoma—
followed by maintenance in subjects achieving an objective response or stable disease—the 
incidence of irAEs was 26%, 56%, and 70%, with an occurrence of grade 3-4 irAEs in 0%, 7%, 
and 25% of subjects, respectively suggesting a dose-response for safety.120

Ipilimumab, at escalating doses of 3, 5, and 10 mg/kg with and without a single dose of XRT administered every 3 weeks up to 4 times was tolerable with a safety profile consistent with that 
demonstrated in previous studies of ipilimuma b. Although no DLTs were observed and no MTD 
was reached during the course of the study, r ate of AEs showed increase from 3 mg/kg to 
10 mg/kg.
121
The phase 3 Study CA184043 evaluated ipilimumab 10 mg/kg monotherapy dose vs. placebo in 
mCRPC.50The overall safety profile for ipilimumab in these studies was generally consistent with 
the previous Phase 1 and 2 studies of ipilimum ab 10 mg/kg monotherapy in prostate cancer. The 
most frequently reported on-study immune-related adverse events of any grade in the ipilimumab 
group were dia rrhea, pruritus, rash, colitis, increased aspartate aminotransferase, and increased 
alanine aminotransferase. While less than 2% of f atal adverse events in either treatment group 
were regarded as drug-related, more on-study deaths occurred overall and in the first 5 months in 
the ipilimumab 10 mg/kg group than in the placebo group. 
1.4.5.4 Nivolumab-plus-Ipilimumab Safety Summary
In the Phase 1b, open-label, multi-center, multi-dose, dose-escalation study of nivolumab in 
combination with ipilimumab, study drugs were  administered either  concurrent ly (Cohorts 1 
through 3, and Cohort 8) or in a sequenced regimen (Cohorts 6 and 7) in subjects with advanced 
melanoma.38Each arm in this multi- arm study had an induction phase (ipilimumab dosed 
Q3 weeks x4; nivolumab dosed Q3 weeks x8) and a maintenance phase (ipilimumab dosed

Q12 weeks x8; nivolumab dosed Q12 weeks x8) . Initial 3 dose-escalatio n cohorts consisted of 
Cohort 1 (nivolu mab 0.3 mg/kg plus ipilimumab 3 mg/kg; n = 14), Cohort 2 (nivolumab 1.0 mg/kg 
plus ipilimumab 3 mg/kg; n = 16) and Cohort 3 (ni volumab 3.0 mg/kg plus ipilimumab 3 mg/kg; 
n = 6).38
Unlike single-agent nivolumab, a dose relationship with toxicity was observed with the 
combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab38. The lowest dose of nivolumab (Cohort 1, 0.3 mg/kg 
with 3 mg/kg ipilimumab) resulted in a lower incidence of Grade 3-4 AEs, SAEs, and AEs leading 
to treatment discontinuation compared with the higher dose cohorts. Treatment with 3 mg/kg nivolumab and 3 mg/kg ipilimumab (Cohort 3) resulted in 3 of 6 subjects experiencing DLTs that exceeded the protocol-defined MTD. No subjects  were enrolle d in Cohorts 4 and 5 because the 
maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was exceeded in  Cohort 3 and the protoc ol was amended to 
evaluate a lower dose of ipilimumab (1 mg/kg) in combination with 3 mg/kg nivolumab (Cohort 2a). Both Cohort 2 (1 mg/kg nivolumab and 3 mg/kg ipilimumab) and Cohort 2a (3 mg/kg 
nivolumab and 1 mg/kg ipilimumab) were deemed tolerable establishing both dose combinations 
as MTD (2 of 17 and 0 of 16 subjects had DLTs in Cohort 2 and 2a, respectively).
38
Treatment with nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab generally resulted in greater 
frequencies of Grade > 3 AEs, SAEs, AEs leading to discontinuation a nd select AEs than that 
observed with either agent alone; however, no new types of AEs were observed. The overall 
frequency in the pooled Cohorts 1-3 and in Cohort 8 of skin, GI, hepatic and endocrine select AEs 
were greater than either agent alone and the frequency of Grade 3-4 select skin, GI, and hepatic 
AEs was higher than that observed with nivolumab or ipilimumab monotherapy in melanoma 
subjects.38In contrast, pulmonary and renal select AEs were only slightly higher than observed 
with single-agent nivolumab .The frequency of some Grade 3-4 AEs, notably those related to GI, hepatic, and skin, were also increased with combination treatment relative to ipilimumab.
38
In study CA209-067, a randomized, double-blind, multicenter, phase 3 trial that was conducted to 
evaluate the safety and efficacy of nivolumab alone or nivolumab combined with ipilimumab in comparison with ipilimumab alone in subjects with previously untreated metas tatic melanoma, 
treatment-related adverse events of any grade occurred in 82.1% of the subjects in the nivolumab 
group, 95.5% of those in the nivolumab plus ipilimumab group, and 86.2% of those in the 
ipilimumab group.
122The most common adverse events in the nivolumab-plus-ipilimumab group 
were diarrhea (in 44.1% of subjects), fatigue (in 35.1%), and pruritus (in 33.2%).122The incidence 
of treatment-related adverse events of grade 3 or 4 was also higher in the 
nivolumab-plus-ipilimumab group (55.0%) than in the nivolumab group (16.3%) or the 
ipilimuma b group (27.3%).122Treatment-related adverse events of any grade that led to 
discontinuation of the study drug occurred in 7.7% of the subjects in the nivolumab group, 36.4% 
of those in the nivolumab plus ipilimumab group, and 14.8% of those in the ipilimumab group, with the most common events being diarrhea (in 1.9%, 8.3%, and 4.5%, respectively) and colitis 
(in 0.6%, 8.3%, and 7.7%, respectively).
122Grade 3 or 4 diarrhea were higher in the combination 
cohort (2.2% in nivolumab group vs. 9.3% in the nivolumab-plus-ipilimumab group, and 6.1% in 
the ipilimumab group). Similarly colitis (in 0.6%, 7.7%, and 8.7%, respectively), and increased

1.5 Overall Risk/Benefit Assessment
New therapeutic options with the potential to provide durable, long term responses across the 
disease states sp ectrum of mCRPC are needed. Several lines of evidence, as outlined in 
Section 1.1.2 , strongly support the investigation of immunotherapy agents to improve outcomes in 
mCRPC.
Safety and efficacy have been demonstrated with both single agent nivolumab and ipilimumab. 
The combination of dual check-point blockade with both of these agents administered together has 
an efficacy advantage over either single agent alone. Same day sequential administration of nivolumab (1 mg/kg) followed by ipilimumab (3 mg/kg) was initially evaluated in 
advanced/metastatic melanoma in 2 studies, the Phase 2 Study CA209069 and the Phase 3 Study 
CA209067, and demonstrated statistically signif icant and clinically meaningful improvements in 
progression-free survival (PFS) and objective re sponse rate (ORR) compared to nivolumab or 
ipilimumab monotherapy.
123,122and served as the basis for an application to extend the indication 
of Opdivo ®to include the use of nivolumab and ipilimumab in combination for the treatment of 
advanced melanoma (United States Packaging Insert [USPI] for nivolumab and Summary of 
Product Characteristics [SmPC] for nivolumab). Subsequently, nivolumab plus ipilimumab has 
also demonstrated clinical activity in several tum or types, including Renal Cell Cancer (RCC)124, 
non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)125, Small Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC)126and gastric cancer127. 
Results to date suggest that the safety profile of  nivolumab plus ipilimumab combination therapy 
is consistent with the mechanisms of action of nivolumab and ipilimumab. The nature of the AEs 
is similar to that observed with either agent used as monotherapy; how ever, both fre quency and 
severity of most AEs are increased with the combination. The adverse event profile of nivolumab 1 mg/kg combined with ipilimumab 3 mg/kg char acterized by immune-related toxicities, such as 
diarrhea, rash, pneumonitis, liver toxicity, and endocrinopathies. These events were mostly low 
grade and manageable with well-established treatment algorithms that included the use of corticosteroids.
The current melanoma label supports sequential administration of nivolumab and then ipilimumab, 
one administered soon after the other. The r ecommended dose and schedule is nivolumab 1 mg/kg 
administered as an intravenous i nfusion over 30 minutes, fo llowed by ipilimumab 3mg/kg 
administered over 90 minutes on the same day, every 3 weeks for four doses. The time in between 
infusions is exp ected to be approximately 30 minutes but may be more or less depending on the 
situation. The recommended maintenance dose given after the combination has been completed is nivolumab, as a single agent, 3 mg/kg, as an in travenous infusion every 2 weeks, until disease 
progression or unacceptable t oxicity. However, in this study after completion of the combination 
portion of the study, subjects w ill receive flat dose 480 mg nivolumab every 4 weeks (Q4W), 
which provides a more convenient dosing regimen for subjects. While 480 mg Q4W is predicted to provide great er (approximately 40%) maximum s teady state concentr ations and lower 
(approximately 15 to 20%) steady state trough concentrations, these exposures are predicted to be

within the exposure ranges observed at doses up to 10 mg/kg Q2W used in the Phase 1 nivolumab 
clinical program, and are not considered to put subjects at increased risk. Similar to the nivolumab Q2W dosing monotherapy regimen, the exposures predicted following administration of 
nivolumab 480 mg Q4W, are on the flat part of the exposure-response curves for previously 
investigated tumors, melanoma and NSCLC, and are not predicted to affect efficacy. 
1.5.1 Based on these data, nivolumab 480 mg Q4W is expected to have 
similar efficacy and safety profiles to nivolumab 3 mg/kg Q2W.Overall 
Risk/Benefit Assessment for Additional Cohort D
As outlined in Section 1.1 , the recent data from Cohorts B and C in CA209650 suggest that 
nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab is an active regimen in patients with mCRPC, with 
potentially greater activity in patients with HRD mutations or higher TMB, but early toxicity was 
the factor which limited the number of combination doses received. Mitigation of severe toxicities 
through alternative combination schedules may help to further improve outcomes, and this 
approach will be explored in the following two arms:
•Arm D1 will evaluate the combination using a lower dose of ipilimumab (1 mg/kg), but at the 
same frequency used in Part 1 (Q3W). As desc ribed earlier, the safety profile and clinical 
activity of Nivolumab 3 mg /kg combined with ipilimumab 1 mg/kg was demonstr ated by the 
approval of this regimen in other cancer types. This combination has also shown acceptable 
safety and encouraging efficacy in men with  AR-V7-expressing advanced prostate cancer who 
harbor DNA-repair alterations.
•Since ipilimumab dose of 3 mg/kg may be critical to enhance immune cell infiltration into 
tumors and driving the anti-tumor response, arm D2 will explore the same dose of ipilimumab 
used in Cohorts B and C (3 mg/kg), but at a redu ced frequency (Q6W), As described earlier, 
CA209012 supports the rationale to decrease ipilimumab dosing frequency to improve 
tolerability, while maintaining efficacy.
Furthermore, as outlined in Sections 1.1.4 and 1.4.5, ipilimumab monotherapy has demonstrated 
clinical activity and an acceptable safety profile, and previous trials in mCRPC highlight the need 
to identify  patients mo st likely to benefit. Ipilimumab will be evaluated 
in Arm D3 to assess its contribution to the activit y of the combination in the chosen population.
Arm D4 will evaluate the standard of care cabazitaxel in the target population and allow for 
comparison with the immunotherapy regimens,  
Cabazitaxel has a well-characterized 
AE profile as a cytotoxic chemotherapy, including the potential of neutropenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting.
To assure an ongoing favorable risk/benefit assessment for participants enrolled into the present 
study, the following safety measures will be  employed throughout the conduct of the study:
•Early interim reviews of safety and efficacy data w ill be performed by the S ponsor and 
participating investigators from the Study Steering Committee for Cohort D after the first 
15 treated subjects for each arm have at least 8 weeks of follow-up after first dose and at least

one post-baseline tumor assessment in subjects receiving immunotherapy in Arms D1, D2, and 
D3.
•Rigorous safety monitoring by BMS to ensure participants’ safety including regular and 
systematic review of safety data, close follow-up of reported safety events, and intensive site 
and study investigator training/education on the implementation of the nivolumab and ipilimumab toxicity management algorithms 
•Open-label drug administration of study treatments to allow for prompt and accurate 
assessment of the unique toxicities associated with study treatments
In conclusion, the overall risk-benefit of the proposed study arms is deemed acceptable.

3 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN
3.1 Study Design and Duration
This is a Phase 2 open-label study of nivolumab plus ipilimumab in subjects with metastatic 
castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). The trial will include 3 treatment cohorts:
Cohort A: Asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic mCRPC subjects who have not been treated 
with and are unable or unwilling to receive second generation hormone therapies or cytotoxic 
chemotherapy in mCRPC setting.
Addendum: Per Revised Protocol 02, Cohort A was dis continued for further enrollment. The 
remainder of Cohort A participants w ill be allocated to Cohorts B and C in order to have more 
precise efficacy estimates in those arms.
Cohort B: Asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic mCRPC subjects who must have progressed 
after second generation hormone therapies in mCRPC setting and have not been treated with 
cytotoxic chemotherapy in mCRPC setting.
Cohort C: Subjects must have progressed after prior taxane-based cytotoxic chemotherapy in the 
mCRPC setting.
In accordance with Revised Protocol 02, 45 subjects w ill be tr eated per treatment Cohorts B and 
C. At least 30 subjects with meas urable disease by RECIST V1.1 criteria will be enrolled in each 
cohort. No more than 15 subjects will have non-measurable disease by RECIST V1.1 in each 
cohort.Subjects will be treated with up to 4 cycles of nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab (Part 1, 
See Section 4.3.1 ), followed by nivolumab monotherapy (Part 2, Section 4.3.2 ) until progression
of disease, unacceptable toxicity, or subject wit hdrawal of consent. In Part 1, a minimum of 1 
combination cycle of nivolumab and ipilimumab is required. Subjects experiencing AEs related 
to combination dose therapy (Part 1) that do not meet dose discontinuation criteria, may proceed 
to nivolumab monotherapy dosing (Part 2) without completing all 4 combination doses, after 
consultation with BMS Medical Monitor, on a case-by-case basis.
Each treatment cycle w ill be 3 weeks in duration for Part 1. Nivolumab and ipilimumab will be 
dosed every 3 weeks for four doses. After completion of the last combination cycle in Part 1 (ie, 6 
weeks after the last dose of nivolumab plus ipilimumab), subjects will then receive nivolumab 
monotherapy every four weeks for Part 2 until progression of disease, un acceptable toxicity, or 
subject withdrawal of consent.

combination dose upon PSA progression or radiographic progression (whichever occurs first), as specified in Section 4.3.5 . Treatment will continue until disease progression, unacceptable 
toxicity, withdrawal of consent, 2 year maximum treatment duration, or the study ends, 
whichever occurs first.
•Arm D2: nivolumab 1 mg/kg every 3 weeks plus ipilimumab 3 mg/kg every 2 cycles (ie, every 6 weeks) for up to 4 ipilimumab doses, followed by nivolumab 480 mg ever y 4 weeks. Subjects

country-specific label) every 3 weeks in combination with oral prednisone or prednisolone 
10 mg daily for up to 10 cy cles. Treatment will continue until disease progression, 
unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, completion of 10 cycles of treatment, or the 
study ends, whichever occurs first.
Randomization will be stratified by the presence or ab sence of measurable disease per investigator 
assessment (measurable disease vs only non-meas urable disease) at study entry to ensure tr eatment 
arms are balanced.
Note: Subjects treated in Arms D3 and D4 w ho progress on or after treatment may be eligible to

Cohort D : The treatment phase consists of 4 open-label treatment arms (Arm D1, D2, D3, and
D4):
•Arm D1: nivolumab and ipilimumab are administered every 3 weeks for up to 4 doses, 
followed by nivolumab administered every 4 week s (Cycle 5 and beyond). The first nivolumab 
dose of 480 mg will be administered 3 weeks after the last combination dose of 
nivolumab/ipilimumab
•Arm D2: nivolumab is administered every three weeks up to 8 doses. Ipilimumab is administered every 6 weeks for up to 4 doses followed by nivolumab administered every 4 weeks (Cycle 9 and beyond). The first flat dose 480 mg nivolumab will be administered 3 weeks after the last nivolumab 1 mg/kg dose (a nd 6 weeks after the last combination dose).
•Arm D3: ipilimumab is administered every 3 weeks for up to 4 doses
•Arm D4: Cabazitaxel will be administered every 3 weeks in combination with oral prednisone 
or prednisolone up to 10 cycles.
For Cohorts B and C, tumor assessments are schedu led to be performed every 8 weeks for 6 months 
following treatment initiation and thereafter  every 12 weeks until radiographic progression or 
withdrawal of consent.
For Arms D1, D2, D3, and D4, tumor assessments  are scheduled to be performed every 8 weeks 
(± 7 days) for 6 months following treatment initiation and thereafter every 12 weeks (± 7 days) 
until radiographic progression has been assessed by the investigator a nd confirmed by BICR (see 
Section 5.5.3 ) or withdrawal of consent.
This treatment phase ends when the subject is discontinued from study therapy. 
Optional Re-induction Combination for Cohorts B, C, Arms D1, and D2
Subjects with PSA progression or with radi ographic progression per R ECIST v1.1/PCWG2
(whichever occurs first) during or after ni volumab monotherapy maintenance may receive 
nivolumab and ipilimumab combination at the same dose levels as assigned at st udy start and

Optional Crossover Combination for Arms D3 and D4
Subjects treated in Arms D3 and D4 who demonstrate radiographic progression assessed by the 
investigator and confirmed by BICR during or after  treatment may be eligible to receive optional 
crossover nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab (A rm D1) if their case is reviewed with and 
approved by the BMS Medical Monitor:
Subjects must continue to meet all inclusion cr iteria and all exclusion criteria specified in 
Section 3.3 , including criteria related to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-
CoV-2) infection.Nivolumab 3 mg/kg plus ipilimumab 1 mg/kg Q3 W for up to 4 cycles, followed by nivolumab 
480 mg mg/kg Q4W is administered ever y 4 weeks until disease progression, unacceptable 
toxicity, withdrawal of consent, completion of 2 years of treatment, or the study ends, whichever 
occurs first. At least a 3 week period from last dose of study treatment (ipilimumab or cabazitaxel) 
is required prior to first dose of crossover treatment.
Study assessments are to be collected as outlined in Section 5 . A tumor assessment within 28 days 
prior to the first crossover dose is recommended, which can serve as the new baseline by which to 
assess response to nivolumab and ipilimumab. Imaging tumor assessments performed during 
crossover nivolumab should be submitted to the central imaging vendor.
Nivolumab treatment be yond initial radi ographic progression defined by RECIST v1.1 (for soft 
tissue lesions) and PCWG2 (for bone lesions) is permitted if the subject has investigator assessed 
clinical benefit and is tolerating the treatment, as specified in Section 4.5.4.
Upon discontinuation of crossover treatment subjects will enter the Follow-Up Phase.
Follow-Up Phase:
•Begins when the decision to disconti nue a subject from study therapy is made (no further 
treatment with study therapy)
•  
•Subjects who discontinue treatment for reasons other than disease progression or consent 
withdrawal will continue to have tumor assessments (if clinically feasible) according to the 
schedule in Table 5.1-5 until progression
•Subjects enrolled in Arms D1, D2, D3, or D4 who discontinue treatment without BICR-
confirmed progression or consent wit hdrawal will continue to have tumor assessments (if 
clinically feasible) according to the schedule in Table 5.1-5 until radiographic progression has 
been assessed by the investigator and confirmed by BICR.
•Subjects will be followed for drug-related toxicities until these toxicities resolve, return to 
baseline or are deemed irreversible. All advers e events will be documented for a minimum of 
100 days after last dose

•After completion of the first two follow-up visits, subjects will be followed every 3 months for 
survival
•BMS may request that survi val data be collected on all tr eated subjects in Cohorts B and C, 
and all randomized subjects in C ohort D outside of the protocol defined window as detailed in 
the Time and Events Table ( Section 5 ). At the time of this request, each subject w ill be 
contacted to determin e their survival s tatus unless the s ubject has withdrawn consent for all 
contact.
•If exceptional circumstances preclude the continued administration of measures using planned 
modalities, then alternate admin istration methods may be required after consultation with a 
sponsor or a sponsor’s representative.
Duration of Study for Cohorts A, B, and C : It is expected that the trial will be open to accrual 
for 9 months, with a planned enrollment of 90 subjects. Survival follow-up will continue until 
BMS informs sites to end the study.
The accrual duration is approximately 9 months, assuming a monthly rate of 10 subjects. The 
analysis of the dual primary endpoint of ORR will occur after all the subjects have been followed 
for a total period of approximately 24 weeks, ie, after treatment with a maximum of 4 cycles of 
combination treatment and at least 2 cycles of nivolumab monotherapy treatment. Subjects who 
receive less than 4 cycles of (ie, between 1-3 cycles), w ill also be included in the analysis after 
they complete 24 weeks of follow-up. 
This will allow sufficient follow up for a stable estimate of best overall response and adequate 
safety follow up. The primary analysis of ORR is  expected to occur approximately 15 months after 
the first subject is treated. The analysis of the dual primary endpoint of rPFS w ill occur after all 
the subjects have been followed up for approximately 12 months since treatment initiation to have 
a stable estimate of one year rPFS.
Additional survival analysis may be conducted for up to 5 years after treatment initiation following 
analysis of the primary endpoint.
Duration of Study for Cohort D: The accrual duration is approximately 24 months for this period.
The analyses of the dual primary endpoints of rPFS and ORR per BICR w ill occur when a round
90% of all randomized subjects have approximately 9 months of minimum follow up, which will 
be a sufficient duration of follow-up for a stable estimate of rPFS and best overall response, as 
well as adequate safety follow up.
Additional long-term survival analysis may be conducted for up to 5 years from the date of 
randomization of th e last patient following analysis of the primary endpoint.

3.4.1.2 Prohibited and/or Restricted Treatments on Cabazitaxel
Treatment with any of the follo wing medications are prohibited during treatment with cabazitaxel 
(Arm D4)
•Concomitant administration of strong CYP3A inhi bitors (eg, ketoconazole, itraconazole, 
clarithromycin, indinavir, nefazodone, nelf inavir, ritonavir, sa quinavi r, telithro mycin, 
voriconazole) should be avoided as an increase of plasma concentr ations of cabazitaxel may 
occur.
•Concomitant administration of strong CYP3A inducers (eg, phenytoin, carbamazepine, 
rifampin, rifabutin, rifapentin, phenobarbital) s hould be avoided as a decrease of plasma 
concentrations of cabazitaxel may occur. In addition, patients should also refrain from taking 
St. John’s Wort.
•Concomitant administration of transport proteins of the Organic Anion Transport Polypeptides 
OATP1B1: In vitro, cabazitaxel has also been shown to inhibit the transport proteins of the 
Organic Anion Transport Polypeptides OATP1B1. The risk of interaction with OATP1B1 
substrates (eg, statins, valsartan, repaglinide)  is possible, notably during the infusion duration 
(1 hour) and up to 20 minutes after the end of the infusion. A time in terval of 12 hours is 
recommended before th e infusion and at leas t 3 hours after the end of infusion be fore 
administering the OATP1B1 substrates.
Additional information can be found in the cabazitaxel prescribing information.
3.4.2 Other Restrictions and Precautions
Palliative (limited-field) ra diation therapy and palliative surgical resection are permitted, if the 
case is discussed with the BMS Medical Monitor or Study Director.
If palliative radiation therapy involves more than one site or if surgery of kyphoplasty to any 
neoplastic lesion is performed, the date of initiation of radiation therapy or date of surgery should 
be reported as the date of clinical progression ( Section 5.5.3 ).
Participants requiring palliative local therapy should be evaluated  (by CT/MRI and bone scan if 
clinically indicated) for objective evidence of dis ease progression prior to the initiation of such 
therapy, particularly if the most recent tumor assessment was more than 4 weeks prior to the 
planned start of local therapy. If progression per PCWG2 is identified prior to the initiation of 
palliative local therapy, then participants must either discontinue study treatment or they must meet criteria to continue treatment be yond progression ( Secti on 4.5.4 ) in order to resume study 
treatment after the completion of palliative local therapy
In cases where palliative radiotherapy is required, nivolumab and ipilimumab dosing s hould be 
withheld for at least 1 week before, during, and 1 week  after radiotherapy. Participants should be 
closely monitored for any potential toxicity during and after receiving radiotherapy, and AEs 
should resolved to Grade ≤1 prior to resuming nivolumab.

3.4.3 Permitted Therapy
Castrate status must be maintained on study; therefore, subjects who have not had an orchiectomy 
must continue on LHRH/GnRH agonist therapy.
Subjects are permitted the use of topical, ocular, intra-articular, intranasal, and inhalational 
corticosteroids (with minimal systemic abs orption). Adrenal replacement steroid doses > 10 mg 
daily prednisone are permitted. A brief ( ≤3 weeks) course of corticosteroids for prophylaxis 
(eg, contrast dye allergy) or for treatment of no n-autoimmune conditions (eg, delayed-type 
hypersensitivity reaction caused by a contact allergen) is permitted.
Bisphosphonates and RANK-ligand inhibitors for bone metastases are allowed to be initiated while 
on study as per institutional SOC guidelines.
3.4.4 Other Restrictions and Precautions
It is the local imaging facility ̓s responsibility to determine, based on subject attributes 
(eg, allergy history, diabetic history and renal status), the appropr iate imaging mod ality and 
contrast regimen for each subject. Imaging contraindications and contrast risks s hould be 
considered in this assessment. Subjects with re nal insufficiency should be assessed as to whether 
or not they should receive contrast and if so, what type and dose of contrast is appropriate.
Specific to M RI, subjects with severe re nal insufficiency (ie, es timated glomerular  filtrati on rate 
(eGFR) < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2) are at increased risk of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis. MRI contrast 
should not be given to this subject population. In addition, subjects are excluded from MRI if they 
have tattoos, metallic implants, pacemakers, etc.
The ultimate decision to perform MRI in an indivi dual subject in this study rests with the site 
radiologist, the investigator and the standard set by the local Ethics Committee.
3.5 Discontinuation of Subjects following any Treatment with Study Drug
The assessment for discontinuation of nivolumab should be made separately from the assessment 
made for discontinuation of ipilimumab. Although there is overlap among the discontinuation 
criteria, if discontinuation criteria are met fo r ipilimumab but not for ni volumab, treatment with 
nivolumab may continue if ipilimumab is discontinued.
If a participant in any of the nivolumab/ipilimumab combination arms meets criteria for 
discontinuation and investigator is unable to determine whether the event is related to both or one 
study drug, the participant should discontinue both nivolumab and ipilimu mab and be taken off 
the treatment phase of the study.
If a subject meets the criteria for discontinuation of ipilimumab but not nivolumab, treatment with 
nivolumab may not resume until the AE has fully resolved and the subject has discontinued 
steroids, if they were required for treatment of  the AE. The relationship to ipilimumab should be 
well documented in the source documents. Nivolumab s hould be resumed at 480 mg every 4 weeks 
starting 6 weeks after the last co-administered dose.

Subjects MUST discontinue investigational product (and non-investigational product at the 
discretion of the investigator) for any of the following reasons:
•Subject’s request to stop study treatment
•Any clinical adverse event (AE), labor atory abnormality or intercurrent illness which, in the 
opinion of the investigator, indicates that continued participation in the study is not in the best 
interest of the subject
•Termination of the study by Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS)
•Loss of ability to fr eely provide consent through imprisonment or involuntarily incarceration 
for treatment of either a psychiatric or physical (eg, infectious diseas e) illness. Note: Under 
specific circumstances and only in countries where local regulations permit, a participant who has been imprisoned may be permitted to continue as a participant. Strict conditions apply and BMS approval is required.
•Additional protocol specified reasons for discontinuation (see  Sections 4.5.3 and 4.5.4)
•Subject meets criteria for radiographic progression by PCWG2 or RECIST v1.1 cr iteria
7
All subjects who discontinue study treatment shoul d comply with protocol specified follow-up 
procedures as outlined in Table 5.1-5. The only exception to this requirement is when a subject 
withdraws consent for all study procedures including post-treatment study follow-up or loses the 
ability to consent freely (ie, is imprisoned or involuntarily  incarcerated for the treatment of either 
a psychiatric or physical illness).
If study treatment is discontinued prior to the subject’s completion of the study, the reason for the 
discontinuation must be documented in th e subject’s medical records and entered on the 
appropriate case report form (CRF) page.
3.6 Follow up after discontinuation of study drug
In this study, overall survival is a key endpoint of the study. Post treatment follow-up is of critical 
importance and is essential to preserving subject safety and the integrity of the study. Subjects who discontinue study treatment must continue to be followed for co llection of outcome and/or survival 
follow-up data as required and in line with Section 3.1 until death or the conclusion of the study.
3.6.1 Withdrawal of Consent
Subjects who request to discontinue study tr eatment w ill remain in the study and must continue to 
be followed for protocol specified follow-up proce dures. The only exception to this is when a 
subject specifically withdraws consent for any further contact with him/her or persons previously 
authorized by subject to provide this information. Subjects should notify the investigator of the 
decision to withdraw consent from future follow-up in writing , if possible. The withdrawal of 
consent should be explained in detail in the medical records by the investigator, as to whether the 
withdrawal is from further treatment with study treatment only or also from study proce dures 
and/or post treatment st udy follow- up, and entered on the appropriate CRF page. As vital status 
(whether the subject is alive or dead) is being measured, publicly available information should be 
used to determine vital status only as appropriately directed in accordance with local law.

3.6.2 Lost to Follow-Up
All reasonable efforts must be made to locate subjects to determine and report their ongoing status. 
This includes follow-up with persons authorized by the subject as noted above. Lost to follow-up 
is defined by the inability to reach the subject after a minimum of three documented phone calls, 
faxes, or emails as well as lack of response by subject to one registered mail letter. All attempts 
should be documented in the subject’s medical records. If it is determined that the subject has died, 
the site will use permissible local methods to obtain the date and cause of death.
If investigator’s use of third-party representative to assist in the follow-up portion of the study has 
been included in the subject’s informed consent, then the investigator may use a Sponsor-retained third-party representative to assist site staff with obtaining subject’s contact information or other 
public vital status data necessary to complete the follow-up portion of the study. The site staff and 
representative will consult publicly available sources, such as public h ealth registries and 
databases, in order to obtain updated contact information. If after all attempts, the subject remains lost to follow-up, then the last known alive date as determined by the investigator s hould be 
reported and documented in the subject’s medical records.

4.1 Investigational Product
An investigational product, also known as investigational medicinal product in some regions, is 
defined a pharmaceutical form of an active substance or placebo being tested or used as a reference 
in a clinical study, including products already wi th a marketing authorization but used or 
assembled (formulated or packaged) differently than the authorized form, or used for an unauthorized indication, or when used to gain further information about the authorized form.
The investigational product should be stored in a secure area according to local regulations. It is 
the responsibility of the investigator to ensure  that investigational product is only dispensed to 
study subjects. The investigational product must be dispensed only from offic ial study sites by 
authorized personnel according to local regulations. 
In this protocol, investigational products are:
•Nivolumab
•Ipilimumab
•Cabazitaxel
4.2 Non-investigational Product
Other medications used as support or escape medication for preventative, dia gnostic, or therapeutic 
reasons, as components of the standard of care for a given diagnosis, may be considered as 
non-investigational products. In this protocol, non-investigational product is:
•Prednisone
4.3 Storage and Dispensing
The product storage manager should ensure that the study treatment is stored in accordance with 
the environmental c onditions (temperature, light, and hu midity) as deter mined by BMS. If 
concerns regarding the quality or appearance of the study tr eatment arise, the st udy tr eatment
should not be dispensed and BMS must be contacted immediately.
Study treatment not supplied by BMS will be stored in accordance with the package insert.
Investigational product documentation (whether supplied by BMS or not) must be maintained that 
includes all processes required to ensure dr ug is accurately administered. This includes 
documentation of drug storage, administration and, as applicable, storage temperatures, reconstitution, and use of required processes (eg, required diluents, administration sets).
4.3.1 Arms A, B, and C Part 1 Study Treatment Administration - Nivolumab 
and Ipilimumab Combination Phase (Cycles 1-4)
In the nivolumab plus ipilimumab combination portion, nivolumab is to be administered first. 
Subjects should receive nivolumab at a dose of 1 mg/kg as a 30-minute IV infusion, on Day 1 of 
each treatment cycle every 3 weeks for 4 doses (Cycles 1-4). In Part 1, a minimum of 
1 combination cycle of nivolumab and ipilimumab is required. Subjects experiencing AEs related

to combination dose therapy (Part 1) that do not meet dose discontinuation criteria, may proceed 
to nivolumab monotherapy dosing (Part 2) without completing all 4 combination doses, after 
consultation with the Medical Monitor, on a case-by-case basis. 
During Part 1, subjects may be dosed no less than  19 days between doses. If dosing is delayed, 
both nivolumab and ipilimumab must be delayed together. If dosing is resumed after a delay, both 
nivolumab and ipilimumab must be resumed on the same day.
The nivolumab infusion must be promptly followed by a flush of diluent to clear the line of 
nivolumab before starting the ipilimumab infusion.The second infusion in the combination will always be ipilimumab, and will start after the infusion 
line has been flushed, filters changed and the subject has been observed to ensure no infusion 
reaction has occurred. The time in between i nfusions is exp ected to be approximately 30 minutes 
but may be more or less depending on the situation. Subjects should receive ipilimumab at a dose 
of 3 mg/kg as a 30-minute IV infusion, on Day 1 of each treatment cycle every 3 weeks for 4 doses (Cycles 1-4). 
Dosing calculations for the combination phase s hould be based on the body weight assessed at 
screening. It is not necessary to re-calculate s ubsequent doses if the subject weight is within 10% 
of the weight used to calculate the previous dose. All doses should be rounded to the nearest 
milligram. 
The risk/benefit profile for nivolumab has primarily been investigated using a 60-minute infusion 
and for ipilimumab a 90-minute infusion. Long i nfusion times place a burd en on subjects and 
treatment centers. Establishing that these agents can be safely administered using shorter infusion 
times will diminish some of this burden. Previous  clinical studies of nivolumab have used a 
60-minute infusion duration, and for ipilimumab 90-minutes. Both nivolumab and ipilimumab 
have been administered safely at doses ranging up to 10 mg/kg over these treatment durations. 
Overall, infusion reactions including high-grade hypersensitivity reactions have been uncommon across multiple clinical studies, and all have been  managed by following the safety algorithms. 
Infusion duration of 30 minutes for 3 mg/kg nivolumab (30% of the dose provided at 10 mg/kg) is 
not expected to present any safety concerns compared with the prior experience at 10 mg/kg 
nivolumab dose infused over the 60-minu te duration. Similarly, a shortened infusion duration of 
30 minutes for ipilimumab is not expected to present additional safety concerns.
129
When given as a single agent, there is a low r ate of infusion reactions. Th e incidence is less than 
1% for ipilimumab (Yervoy ®FDA Label) and for nivolumab 3%. In the CA209069 study, in 
which nivolumab and ipilimumab were given se quentially, hypersensitivi ty/infusion reactions 
occurred at 3.2% for the combination and at 2.2% for ipilimumab. No Grade 3 or Grade 4 hypersensitivity/infusion reactions were observed in either the combination or single agent 
ipilimumab treatment groups.
130
Subjects should be carefully  monitored for infusion r eactions during nivolumab/ipilimumab 
administration. If an  acute infusion r eaction is noted, s ubjects should be ma naged according to 
Section 4.5.7 .

Monotherapy Phase (Cycle 5 and beyond)
Starting 6 weeks after the last co-administered dos e in Part 1, subjects will be administered a flat 
dose of 480 mg nivolumab on Day 1 of each 4 week treatment cy cle given IV given over 
approximately 30 minutes every 4 weeks (Q4W) until unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.
Subjects may be dosed up to 3 days before or after  the scheduled date if necessary. Subsequent 
dosing should be based on the actual date of administration of the previous dose of drug. Every 
effort should be made to adhere to the protocol treatment schedule of administration of nivolumab 
every 4 weeks in the monotherapy phase. In extenuating circumstances in which the subject cannot 
make the dosing schedule within the 3-day window, the BMS Medical Monitor should be 
contacted.
Premedications are not recommended for the first dose of nivolumab monotherapy.Subjects from Cohorts B and C who entered the main tenance period may be permitted re-induction 
with the combination after approval by the BMS medical monitor (see Section 4.3.5 ).
4.3.3 Arm D1 Study Treatment Administration - Nivolumab and Ipilimumab

treatment cycle every 3 weeks for 4 doses (Cycles 1 to 4), followed by nivolumab 480 mg 
administered IV over 30 minutes on Day 1 of each treatment cycle every 4 weeks ( ±3 days) until
progression, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, completion of 2 years of treatment, or 
the study ends, whichever occurs first. The first flat dose 480 mg nivolumab will be administered3 weeks after the last combination dose.
Participants should begin study treatment within 3 calendar days of randomization. During the 
combination portion, s ubjects may be dosed no less than 19 days between doses. If dosing is 
delayed, both nivolumab and ipilimumab must be delayed together. If dosing is resumed after a 
delay, both nivolumab and ipilimumab must be resumed on the same day.
When study treatments (nivolumab and ipilimumab) are to be administered on the same day, 
nivolumab is to be administered first. Nivolumab infusion must be promptly followed by a flush 
of diluent to clear the line of nivolumab before starting the ipilimumab infusion. The sec ond 
infusion will always be the ipilimumab study tr eatment and will start after the i nfusion line has 
been flushed, filters changed and patient has b een observed to ensure no infusion r eaction has 
occurred.  
During the combination phase, a minimum of 1 c ombination cycle of nivolumab and ipilimumab 
is required. Subjects experiencing AEs related to  combination dose therapy that do not meet dose 
discontinuation criteria, may proceed to nivolumab monotherapy dosing without completing all 4 
combination doses, after consultation with the Medical Monitor, on a case-by-case basis. 
Dosing calculations for the combination phase s hould be based on the body weight assessed at 
baseline. It is not necessary to re-calculate subsequent doses if the participant weight is within 10%

Subjects rando mized to Arm D2 will receive nivolumab at a dose of 1 mg/kg as a 30-minute IV 
infusion, on Day 1 of  each treatment cy cle every 3 weeks for 8 cycles (on weeks 1, 4, 7, 10, 13, 
16, 19 and 22) and ipilimumab 3 mg/kg administered IV over 30 minutes every 2 cycles (ie, every 
6 weeks on weeks 1, 7, 13 and 19) for 4 ipilimumab doses, followed by nivolumab 480 mg 
administered IV over 30 minutes on Day 1 of each treatment cy cle every 4 weeks ( ±3 days) 
starting from cy cle 9 (week 25). Treatment will be administered until progression, unacceptable 
toxicity, withdrawal of consent, completion of 2 years of treatment, or the study ends, whichever 
occurs first. The first flat dose 480 mg nivolumab  will be administered 3 weeks after the last 
nivolumab 1 mg/kg dose (and 6 weeks after the last combination dose).
Participants should begin study treatment within 3 calendar days of randomization. During the combination phase, subjects may be dosed with nivolumab no less than 19 days from the previous dose of nivolumab and may be dosed with ipilimumab no less than 37 days from the previous dose of ipilimumab. 
When study treatments (nivolumab and ipilimumab) are to be administered on the same day, 
nivolumab is to be administered first. Nivolumab infusion must be promptly followed by a flush

RECIST v1.1/PCWG2 (whichever occurs first; see Section 5.5.3 ), and after discussion and 
agreement with BMS Medical Monitor. 
For subjects in Arm D1, the first re-induction combination dosing can start no sooner than 4 weeks 
after the last nivolumab 480 mg dose and no sooner than 12 weeks after the last ipilimumab dose.
For subjects in Arm D2, the first re-induction combination dosing can start no sooner than 8 weeks 
after the last nivolumab 480 mg dose and no sooner than 12 weeks after the last ipilimumab dose.
Pausing nivolumab maintenance dosing is permitted in patients who are planning to receive 
re-induction in Arm D2.
Subjects entering this phase w ill follow the same Time and Events schedule as outlined in Table 
5.1-2 and Table 5.1-4 .
Subjects undergoing re-induction of study therapy s hould continue to meet eligibility criteria at 
the time study tr eatment resumes and should not have experienced a toxicity that would require 
permanent discontinuation of study therapy. Subjects will continue to receive study therapy at the 
same dose levels as assigned at study start.
Additional, separate, safety and efficacy summari es will be presented for those subjects who 
reinitiated study therapy.
4.3.6 Arm D3 Study Treatment Administration
Participants should receive ipilimumab at a dose of  3 mg/kg administered IV over 30 minutes on 
Day 1 of each treatment cy cle every 3 weeks for 4 doses. Treatment will continue until disease 
progression, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of c onsent, completion of 4 cycles of treatment, or 
the study ends, whichever occurs first.
Participants should begin study treatment with in 3 calendar days of randomization. Subj ects may 
be dosed with ipilimumab no less than 19 days from the previous dose of ipilimumab.Dosing calculations should be based on the body weight assessed at baseline. It is not necessary to 
re-calculate subsequent doses if the participant weight is within 10% of the weight used to calculate the previous dose. All doses should be rounded up or to the nearest milligram per institutional 
standard.
Premedication for Arm D3 is not recommended for the first dose of ipilimumab.
4.3.7 Arm D4 Study treatment administration - cabazitaxel plus prednisone
The recommended dose of cabazitaxel is 20 mg/m
2or 25 mg/m2at investigator’s discretion and 
according to country-specific label, administered as a 1 hour intravenous infusion every 3 weeks 
in combination with oral prednisone or prednisolone 10 mg admin istered d aily throughout 
treatment. Since cabazitaxel is extensively metabolized by the liver, patients with mild hepatic 
impairment (total bilirubin >1 to ≤1.5 × ULN or AST >1.5 × ULN) must start cabazitaxel at the 
dose of 20 mg/m2.

Dosing of cabazitaxel will continue for a maximum of 10 cycles every 3 weeks ( ±3 days), until 
progression, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, or the study ends, whichever occurs 
first. Participants should begin study treatment within 3 calendar days of randomization.
Dosing calculations of cabazitaxel s hould be based on the body weight assessed at baseline. It is 
not necessary to re-calculate subsequent doses if the participant weight is within 10% of the weight 
used to calculate the previous dose. All doses should be rounded up or to the nearest milligram per 
institutional standard.
Premedication for cabazitaxel
The recommended premedication regimen should be performed at least 30 minutes prior to each 
administration of cabazitaxel with the follo wing intravenous medicinal products to mitigate the 
risk and severity of hypersensitivity:
•antihistamine (dexchlorpheniramine 5 mg or diphenhydramine 25 mg or equivalent),
•corticosteroid (dexamethasone 8 mg or equivalent), and
•H2 antagonist (ranitidine or equivalent)
The above prophylaxis can be adjusted according to  local standards in patients who have 
experienced hypersensitivity reactions not requiring discontinuation.
Antiemetic prophylaxis is recommended and can be given orally or intrav enously as  per local 
guidelines.
4.3.8 Study Treatment Preparation and Infusion
Separate infusion bags and filters should be used when administering nivolumab and ip ilimumab 
on the same day.
For details on prepared study tr eatment stora ge, preparation, and administration, please refer to the 
current nivolumab and ipilimumab IBs and/or pharmacy manual.4.4 Method of Assigning Treatment
CA209650 is an open-label study. After the subject’s initial eligibility is established and informed 
consent has been obtained, the subject must be enrolled into the study by accessing an Interactive Response Technologies web-based system (IWRS)  to obtain the subject number. Every subject 
that signs the informed consent form must be  assigned a subject number in IWRS. Specific 
instructions for using IWRS will be provided to th e investigational site in a separate document. 
All participants in Cohort D w ill be centrally randomized  using IWRS. Before the study is initiated, 
each user will receive log in information and directions on how to access the IWRS. The following information is required for enrollment:
•Date that informed consent was obtained
•Date of birth

There will be no dose escalations of study treatment allowed. Dose reductions are only allowed 
for cabazitaxel.
Doses may be interrupted, delayed, or discontinued depending on how well the subject toler ates 
the treatment. Dosing visits are not skipped, only delayed. The maximum duration of treatment of 
2 years includes any dose interruptions or delays in Cohort D. It is strongly reco mmended that 
subjects in Cohorts A, B, and C limit treatment duration with immunothe rapy treatment for up to 
2 years. For subjects in these cohorts who r eceive immunothe rapy treatment be yond 2 years, 
treatment will be given for a maximum of 5 years from the start of study treatment.
When subjects are treated Q3W, subjects may be dosed no less than 19 days between doses. 
If dosing is delayed, both nivolumab and ipilimumab must be delayed together. If dosing is 
resumed after a delay, both nivolumab and ipilimumab must be resumed on the same day.
During nivolumab monotherapy, s ubjects may be dosed within a ±3 day window. 
Subjects experiencing AEs related to combination dose therapy that do not meet dose 
discontinuation criteria, may proceed to nivolumab monotherapy dosing without completing all 4 
combination doses, after consultation with BMS Medical Monitor, on a case-by-case basis (Section 4.5.3 ).
4.5.1 Dose Delay Criteria for Nivolumab and Ipilimumab
Regardless of whether or not the event is attributed to nivolumab or ipilimumab, both study 
treatments must be delayed un til treatment can resume. Tumor assessments for all subjects should 
continue as per protocol even if dosing is delayed. During Part 1, both nivolumab and ipilimumab 
should be delayed at the same time.
Nivolumab and ipilimumab administration should be delayed for the following:
•Any Grade ≥2 non-skin, drug-related adverse event, with the following exception:
−Grade 2 drug-related fatigue does not require a treatment delay
•Grade 2 drug-related creatinine, AST, ALT or Total Bilirubin abnormalities 
•Any Grade 3 skin, drug-related adverse event

−Grade ≥3 AST, ALT, Total Bilirubin will require dose discontinuation
•Any adverse event, laboratory abnormality, or intercurrent illness which, in the judgment of 
the investigator, warrants delaying the dose of study medication
•SARS-CoV-2 infection either confirmed or suspected
Subjects who require delay of study treatment should be re-evaluated weekly or more frequently 
if clinically indicated and resume dosing when re-treatment criteria are met.
4.5.2 Criteria to Resume Treatment for Nivolumab and Ipilimumab
Subjects may resume treatment with study tr eatment when the drug-related AE(s) resolve to 
Grade≤1 or baseline value, with the following exceptions:
•Subjects may resume treatment in the presence of Grade 2 fatigue
•Subjects who have not experienced a Grade 3 drug-r elated skin AE may resume treatment in 
the presence of Grade 2 skin toxicity
•For subjects with Grade 2 AST, ALT, or TBILI elevations, dosing may resume when 
laboratory values return to baseline and manage ment with corticosteroids, if needed, is 
complete
•Subjects with combined Grade 2 AST/ALT AND total bilirubin values meeting 
discontinuation parameters (Section 4.5.3 ) should have treatment permanently discontinued
•Drug-related pulmonary tox icity, dia rrhea or colitis must have resolved to baseline before 
treatment is resumed. Subjects with persistent Grade 1 pneumonitis after completion of a 
steroid taper over at least 1 month may be eligible for retreatment if discussed with and 
approved by BMS Medical Monitor
Subjects with drug-related endocrinopathies adequately controlled with only physiologic hormone 
replacement may resume treatment after consu ltation with the BMS Medical Monitor. Adrenal 
insufficiency requires discontinuation regardless of control with hormone replacement.
4.5.3 Dose Discontinuation for Nivolumab and Ipilimumab

oConcurrent AST or ALT > 3 x ULN and total bilirubin > 2x ULN
*In most cases of Grade 3 AST or ALT elevation, study treatment(s) w ill be permanently 
discontinued. If the investigator determines a po ssible favorable benefit/risk ratio that warrants 
continuation of study treatment(s), a discussion between the investigator and the BMS Medical 
Monitor/designee must occur.

4.5.4 Treatment Beyond Disease Progression
Accumulating evidence indicates that some sub jects treated with immunotherapy may derive 
clinical benefit despite initial evidence of PD. 
Subjects treated with immunotherapy study treatment(s) w ill be per mitted to continue tr eatment 
beyond initial radiographic progression defined by RECIST v1.1 (for soft tissue lesions) and 
PCWG2 (for bone lesions) as described in Section 5.5.3 . Subjects in Arm D4 may not receive 
treatment beyond progression. Subjects who meet PD criteria as assessed by the investigator may 
continue with study therapy as long as they meet the following criteria (following consultation with BMS Medical Monitor):
•Investigator-assessed clinical benefit
•Tolerance of study treatment
•Stable performance status
•Treatment beyond progression will not d elay an imminent intervention to prevent serious 
complications of disease progression (eg, CNS metastases)
•Subject provides written informed consent prior to receiving additional nivolumab and 
ipilimumab combination or nivolumab monothe rapy treatment. All other elements of the main 
consent including description of reasonably foreseeable risks or discomforts, or other 
alternative treatment options will still apply.
Radiographic assessment/ scan(s) should continue in accordance with the Section 5 Schedule of 
Activities for the duration of the treatment be yond progression and should be submitted to the 
central imaging vendor. The assessment of clinical benefit s hould be b alanced by clinical judgment 
as to whether the subject is clini cally deteri orating and unlikely to r eceive any benefit from 
continued treatment with nivolumab.

If the investigator feels that the subject continues to achieve clinical benefit by continuing 
treatment, the sub ject should remain on the trial and continue to r eceive monitoring according to 
the Time and Events Schedule ( Section 5).
For the subjects who continue study therapy beyond progression, further progression is defined as 
follows:
Further disease progression of soft tissue is de fined as an additional 10% increase in tumor burden 
with a minimum 5 mm absolute increase from time of init ial PD. This includes an increase in the 
sum of diameters of all target lesions and/ or the diameters of new measurable lesions compared 
to the time of initial PD. New lesions are considered  measureable at th e time of init ial progression if the longest diameter 
is at least 10 mm (except for pathological lymph nodes which must have a short axis of at least 
15 mm). Any new lesion considered non-measureable at the time of initial progression may 
become measureable and therefore included in the tumor burden if the longest diameter increases 
to at least 10 mm (except for pathological lymph nodes which must have a short axis of at least 15 mm). In situations where the relative increase in total tumor burden by 10% is solely due to 
inclusion of new lesions which become measurable, these new lesions must demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm.
Further bone disease progression is defined as additional two or more new bone lesions noted on 
bone scans compared to the time of PCWG2-defined progression of bone disease.
Nivolumab-plus-ipilimumab or nivolumab treatmen t should be discontinued permanently upon 
documentation of further progression.
Confirmed PSA progression alone is not an indication to stop treatment.
4.5.5 Dose Delay, Modification, and Discontinuation for Cabazitaxel
Regardless of whether or not the event is attributed to cabazitaxel, study treatment must be d elayed 
until treatment can resume. Tumor assessments for all sub jects should continue as per protocol 
even if dosing is delayed. 
Cabazitaxel administration should be delayed for the following:
•SARS-CoV-2 infection either confirmed or suspected
The cabazitaxel dose w ill be modified in case of toxicity. Dose modif ications are summarized in

4.5.5.2 Dose Reduction for cabazitaxel
Cabazitaxel dose can be reduced when necessary as  described in following sections. The dose, 
which has been reduced for toxicity, must not be re-escalated. Up to a maximum of 2 dose 
reductions will be allowed per patient. If a third dose reduction is required per the modifications 
below, the patient should discontinue study treatment.

Note: Starting dose is 20 mg/m2 or 25 mg/m2 at investig ator’s discretion and according to country-specific label;
participants with hepatic impairment must start cabazitaxel at the dose of 20 mg/m2 ).
4.5.5.3 Special Precautions for Cabazitaxel
1) Risk of neutropenia: Neutropenia is the most common adverse reaction of cabazitaxel. 
Monitoring of complete blood counts is essentia l on a weekly basis during cycle 1 and before 
each treatment cycle thereafter so that the dose can be adjusted, if needed. Patients treated with 
cabazitaxel may receive prophylactic G-C SF as per current institutional guidelines, to reduce 
the risk or manage ne utropenia complications.
2) Primary prophylaxis with G-CSF s hould be considered in patients with high-risk clinical 
features (age >65 years, poor performance status, previous episodes of febrile neutropenia, 
extensive prior radiation ports, poor nutritional status, or other serious comorbidities) that 
predispose them to increased complications from prolonged neutropenia.
3) Gastrointestinal disorders: Symptoms such as abdominal pain and tenderness, fever, persistent 
constipation, diarrhea, with or without neutropen ia, may be early manifestations of serious 
gastrointestinal toxicity and should be evaluated and treated promptly. 
4) Nausea, vomiting and severe diarrhea, at times , may occur. Deaths related to diarrhea and 
electrolyte imbalance occurred in  the randomized clinical trials. Intensive measures may be 
required for severe diarrhea and electrolyte imbalance. Antiemetic prophylaxis is 
recommended. Treat patients with rehydration, antidiarrheal or antiemetic medications as 
needed.
4.5.5.4 Prednisone Dose Modifications and Dose Delays 
Prednisone or prednisolone doses should not be d elayed or modified or stopped (unless there is a 
contraindication to c ontinue, the decision w ill be left to the investigat or’s discretion). If prednisone 
or prednisolone is stopped, the patient will continue cabazitaxel treatment in the absence of major 
toxicity, disease progression, or any other di scontinuation criteria as defined in  Section 4.5.5 .

4.5.5.5 Criteria to Resume Study Treatment following SARS-CoV-2 Infection
Participants with SARS-CoV-2 infection (eit her confirmed or suspecte d) may resume treatment 
after all of the following :
1) at least 10 days (20 days for severe/critical illness)  have passed since symptoms first appeared 
or positive test result (eg, RT-PCR or viral antigen)
2) resolution of acute symptoms  (including at least 24 hours has passed since last fever without 
fever reducing medications)
3) evaluation by the investigator with confirmation that there are no sequelae that would place 
the participant at a higher risk of receiving investigational treatment 
4) consultation by the Medical Monitor. For suspected cases, treatment may also resume if SARS-
CoV-2 infection is ruled-out and other criteria to resume treatment are met.
4.5.6 Management Algorithms for Immuno-Oncology Agents
Immuno-oncology (I-O) agents are associated with AEs that can differ in severity and duration 
than AEs caused by other therapeutic classes. Nivolumab and ipilimumab are considered immuno-oncology agents in this protocol. Early recognition and management of AEs associated with immuno-oncology agents may mitigate severe toxicity. Management Algorithms have been 
developed to assist investigators in assessing and managing the following groups of AEs:
•Gastrointestinal
•Renal
•Pulmonary
•Hepatic
•Endocrinopathy
•Skin
•Neurological
•Myocarditis
The above algorithms are found in the Appendix 1  of this protocol.
4.5.7 Treatment of Related Infusion Reactions
4.5.7.1 Nivolumab and Ipilimumab Treatment of Related Infusion Reactions
Since nivolumab and ipilimumab contain only human immunoglobulin protein sequences, they are 
unlikely to be immunogenic and induce infusion or hypersensitivity reactions. However, if such a 
reaction were to occur, it might manifest wi th fever, chills, rigors, h eadache, rash, pruritus, 
arthralgias, hypotension, hypertension, bronchos pasm, or other allergic-like reactions. All 
Grade 3 or 4 infusio n reactions s hould be reported within 24 hours to the study medical monitor 
and reported as an SAE if it meets the criter ia. Infusion reactions shoul d be graded according to 
NCI CTCAE (Version 4.0) guidelines.

Treatment recommendations are provided below and may be modified based on local treatment 
standards and guidelines, as appropriate:
For Grade 1 symptoms: (mild reaction; i nfusion interruption not indicated; intervention not 
indicated):
•Remain at bedside and monitor subject until recovery from symptoms. The following 
prophylactic premedications are recommended fo r future infusions : diphenhydramine 50 mg 
(or equivalent) and/or acetaminophen/paracetamol 325 to 1000 mg at least 30 minutes before 
additional nivolumab and/or ipilimumab administrations.
For Grade 2 symptoms: (moderate reaction require d therapy or infusion in terruption but responds 
promptly to symptomatic treatment (eg, antihis tamines, non-steroidal anti-inf lammatory drugs, 
narcotics, corticosteroids, bronchodilators, IV fluids); prophylactic medications indicated for 
≤24 hours):
•Stop the study treatment infusion, begin an IV infus ion of normal saline, and treat the subj ect 
with diphenhydramine 50 mg IV (or equivalent) and/or acetaminophen/paracetamol 325 to 
1000 mg; remain at bedside and monitor subject until resolution of symptoms. Corticosteroid 
and/or bronchodilator therapy may also be admin istered as appropriate.  If the infusion is 
interrupted, then restart the i nfusion at 50% of the original infusion r ate when symptoms 
resolve; if no further co mplications ensue after 30 minutes, the rate may be increased to 100% 
of the original infusion rate. Monitor subject clo sely. If symptoms recur, then no further study
treatment will be adminis tered at that visit
•For future infusions, the following prophylactic premedications are recommended: 
diphenhydramine 50 mg (or equivalent) and/ or acetaminophen/paracetamol 325 to 1000 mg 
should be administered at least 30 minutes before nivolumab and/or ipilimumab i nfusions. If 
necessary, corticosteroids (up to 25 mg of  hydrocortisone or equivalent) may be used
For Grade 3 or 4 symptoms: (sev ere reaction, Grade 3:  prolonged [ie, not rapidly responsive to 
symptomatic medication and/or brief interruption of infusion]; recurrence of symptoms following 
initial improv ement; hospi talization ind icated for other clinical sequelae (eg, renal impairment, 
pulmonary infiltrates). Grade 4: Life-threaten ing; pressor or ventilatory support indicated):
•Immediately discontinue infusion of study treatment.  Begin an IV infusion of normal saline 
and treat the sub ject as follows: Recommend bronchodilators, ep inephrine 0.2 to 1 mg of a 
1:1000 solution for subcutaneous administr ation or 0.1 to 0.25 mg of a 1:10,000 solution 
injected slowly for IV administration, and/or diphenhydramine 50 mg IV with 
methylprednisolone 100 mg IV (or equivalent), as needed. Subject should be monitored until 
the Investigator is comfortable that the symptoms will not recur. Study tr eatment w ill be 
permanently discontinued. Investigators should follow their institutional guidelines for the treatment of anaphylaxis. Remain at bedside and monitor subject until recovery of the 
symptoms

In case of late-occurring hypersensitivity symptoms  (eg, appearance of a localized or generalized 
pruritus within 1 week after treatment), symptomatic treatment may be given (eg, oral 
antihistamine or corticosteroids).
4.5.7.2 Hypersensitivity Reactions for Cabazitaxel
All patients should be pre-medicated prior to the initiation of the i nfusion of cab azitaxel (see 
Section 4.5.5 ).
Patients should be observed closely for hypersensi tivity reactions especially during the first and 
second infusions. Hypersensitivity r eactions may occur within a few minutes following the 
initiation of the infusion of cabazitaxel, thus  facilities and equipment for the tr eatment of 
hypotension and bronchospasm s hould be av ailable. Severe reactions can occur and may include 
generalized rash/erythema, hypotension and bronchospasm. Severe hypersensitivity reactions 
require immediate discontinuation of cabazitaxel and appropriate therapy.
4.6 Blinding/Unblinding
This is an Open-label study, blinding procedures are not applicable.
4.7 Treatment Compliance
Treatment compliance will be monitored by drug accountability as well as the subject’s medical 
record and electronic case report form (eCRF).
4.8 Return of Study Treatment
For this study, IP (those supplied by BMS, a vendor  or sourced by the investig ator) such as  partially 
used study treatment c ontainers, vials and syringes may be destroyed on site. 
It is the investigator’s or designee’s responsibility to arrange for disposal, provided that procedures 
for proper disposal have been established accord ing to applicable feder al, state, local, and 
institutional guidelines and procedures, and provided that appropriate records of disposal are kept. 
The following minimal standards must be met:
•On-site disposal practices must not  expose humans to risks from the drug
•On-site disposal practices and procedures are in agreement with applicable laws and 
regulations, including any special requirements for controlled or hazardous substances
•Written procedures for on-site disposal are available and followed. The procedures must be 
filed with the site’s SOPs and a copy provided to  BMS upon request
•Records are maintained that allow for traceability of each container, including the date 
disposed of, quantity disposed, and identificati on of the person disposing the containers. The 
method of disposal, ie, incinerator, licensed sanitary landfill, or licensed waste disposal vendor 
must be documented
•Accountability and disposal records are complete,  up-to-date, and available for the Monitor to 
review throughout the clinical trial period
It is the investigator’s or designee’s responsibility to arrange for disposal of all empty containers.

5.4 Safety Assessments
At screening, a medical history w ill be ob tained to capture r elevant underlying conditions. The 
screening examinations should include weight, height, ECOG Performance Status, blood pressure 
(BP), heart rate (HR), and temperature. Screening assessments should be performed within 28 calendar days prior to first treatment or as  indicated in Schedule of Assessments Table.
Screening local laboratory assessments should be  done within 14 calendar days prior to first 
treatment and are to in clude: CBC with differential, Chemistry panel including LFTs (ALT, AST, 
total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase), BUN or serum urea level, creatinine, Ca, Na, K, Cl, phosphate, LDH, glucose, albumin, amylase, lipase, PTT, PT, and INR.
The following screening local laboratory assessments s hould be done wi thin 28 calendar days prior 
to first treatment: thyroid panel including TSH, free T3, and free T4 and Hepatitis B and C testing 
(HBV sAg and HCV Ab or HCV RNA).
While on-study the following local laboratory asse ssments are to be done within 72 hours prior to
each dose: CBC with differential, LFTs (ALT,  AST, total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase), BUN 
or serum urea level, creatinine, Ca, Na, K, Cl, phosphate, LDH, glucose, albumin, amylase, and
lipase.For Cohorts A, B, and C; PTT, PT, and INR are to be done within 72 hours prior to each dose; and

each sequential combination dose infusion) for on-t reatment Part 1 phase (ie, during the period of 
same day sequential dosing with nivolumab 1 mg/ kg followed by ipilimumab 3 mg/kg), then every 
8 weeks for subjects receiving nivolumab at 480 mg q4w.
For Cohort D, thyroid function testing (TSH with reflexive fT3 and fT4) is to be done every 
3 weeks for Q3W dosing cycles, then every 8 weeks for subjects receiving nivolumab at 480 mg q4w dosing cycles.
Subjects will be evalu ated for safety if they have received any study treatment. Toxicity 
assessments will be continuous during the treatment phase as well as during the first two safety 
follow-up visits. Once subjects reach the survival follow-up phase, either in-person visits or 
documented telephone calls/email correspondence to assess the subject’s status are acceptable.
Adverse events and laboratory values will be  graded according to the NCI-CTCAE version 4.
The start and stop time of the study ther apy infusions and a ny interruptions or i nfusion r ate 
reductions should be documented.Physical examinations are to be performed as clinically indicated. If there are any new or 
worsening clinically significant changes sin ce the last exam, report changes on the appropriate 
non-serious or serious adverse event page.
On treatment local laboratory assessments are to  be completed within 3 calendar days prior to 
dosing.Additional measures, including non-study required laboratory tests, should be performed as 
clinically ind icated or to comply with local regu lations. Laboratory toxicities (eg, suspected drug 
induced liver enzyme evaluations) will be monitored during the follow-up phase via on si te/local 
labs until all st udy treatment r elated toxicities resolve, return to baseline, or are deemed 
irreversible.
If a subject shows pulmonary-related signs (hypoxia, fever) or symptoms (eg, dyspnea, cough, 
fever) consistent with possible pulmonary ad verse events, the s ubject s hould be immediately 
evaluated to rule out pulmonary toxicity, according to the suspected pulmonary toxicity management algorithm in the BMS-936558 (nivolumab) Investigator Brochure and in Appendix 1  
of this protocol.
Some of the assessments referred to in this section may not be captured as data in the eCRF. They 
are intended to be used as safety monitoring by the treating physician. Additional testing or assessments may be performed as clinically necessary or where required by institutional or local 
regulations.
5.4.1 Imaging Assessment for the Study
Any incidental findings of potent ial clinical relevance that are not directly associated with the 
objectives of the protocol should be evaluated and handled by the Study Investigator as per
standard medical/clinical judgment. Images will be submitted to a central imaging vendor and may undergo BICR at any time during the study. Prior to scanning first participant, sites s hould be

qualified and understand the image acquisition guide lines and submission process as outlined in 
the CA209650 Imaging Manual provided by the central imaging vendor.
Tumor assessments at other timepoints may be perf ormed if clinically indicated and should be 
submitted to the central imaging vendor as soon as possible. Unscheduled CT/MRI should be 
submitted to central imag ing vendor. X-rays that clearly demonstr ate interval progression of 
disease (for example, unequivocal lesions that are unmistakably new since the prior CT/MRI)should be submitted to central imaging vendor. Otherwise, X-rays do not need to be submitted 
centrally. 
5.5 Efficacy Assessments
Study evaluations will take place in accordance with the flow charts in Section 5.1 . Baseline 
assessments should be performed within 28 calendar days prior to first treatment ut ilizing CT or 
MRI and radionuclide bone scan. In addition to chest, abdomen, pelvis, and brain, all known sites 
of disease should be assessed at baseline. 
Subjects who cannot receive CT IV  contrast should be imaged by MRI of abdomen/pelvis with IV 
contrast and CT of chest without contrast. Subsequent assessments should include chest, abdomen, and pelvis, and all known sites of disease 
should use the same imaging method as was used at baseline.
Subjects who cannot receive either CT or MRI contrast can be monitored by CT of chest, abdomen, 
and pelvis without IV contrast. To ensure a uniform tumor assessment (TA) schedule, regular radiological imaging (eg, MRI/CT 
of chest, abdomen, pelvis, plus other nodal di sease as applicable, and bone scans) will be 
performed for all sub jects at Screening, and thereafter for tumor response beginning 8 weeks 
(±7 days) from first treatment and continuing every 8 weeks ( ±7 days) for the first 6 months from 
first treatment, and every 12 weeks ( ±7 days) thereafter.  Cohorts A, B, and C will continue scans
until radiographic disease progression is documented by the investigator or treatment is 
discontinued (whichever occurs later). Cohort  D will have scans performed until radi ographic 
progression has been assessed by the investigator and is confirmed by BICR or treatment is 
discontinued (whichever occurs later).
All disease progression should be evaluated per Table 5.5.3-1.
Subjects that enter Follow-up phase without documented PD will have tumor assessments as 
specified in Table 5.1-5 .
For all treated subjects in Cohorts A, B, C, and for all randomized subjects in Cohort D, scans will be collected and held by a centralized imaging core laboratory for review by independent 
radiologists using RECIST v1.1 and PCWG2 (for bone disease progression) criteria. Scans will be centrally reviewed by BICR retrospectively for Cohor ts A, B, and C, and prospectively on a rolling 
basis for Cohort D.
For subjects with measurable disease, tumor assessments for ongoing study treatment decisions 
will be completed by the investigator using RECIST v1.1 criteria.

5.5.1 Primary Effi cacy Endpoints
The dual primary endpoints  are overall response r ate (ORR) by RECIST v1.1 for sub jects with 
measurable disease and radiographic progression- free survival (rPFS) assessed by BICR for all 
subjects as detailed in Table 5.5.3-1. BICR assessment will be performed retrospectively in 
Cohorts A, B, and C, and prospectively in Cohort D.
Objective response r ate (ORR) is defined as the proportion of subjects who had confirmed 
complete or par tial best overall re sponse (BOR) among tr eated subjects with meas urable disease 
at baseline In all subjects, radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS) is defined as the time 
between the date of first treatment and the firs t date of documented radiographic progression or 
death due to any cause, whichever occurs first.
The consensus guidelines of the Response Ev aluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, version 1.1 
(RECIST v1.1) and the Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Working Group 2 (PCWG2) have been 
taken into consideration for the determination of radiographic disease progression assessment. 
Radiographic disease progression is defined by RECIST v1.1 for soft tissue disease, or by PCWG2 
for bone lesions demonstrated on Tc99m based radionuclide bone scans.
If exceptional circumstances preclude the conti nued administration of measures using planned 
modalities, then alternate administration methods may be required after consultation with a 
sponsor or a sponsor’s representative.
5.5.2 Method of Tumor Response Assessment
All target and non-target sites of disease identif ied on the baseline bone scan, CT or MRI studies 
should be reassessed with the same imaging mod ality at subsequent assessments. If, due to a 
radioisotope shortage, your imaging fac ility is unable to pe rform a Technetium-99m (Tech-99m) 
bone scan at a protocol-specified time point, then  the following scanning options may be used:
•Full body CT
•Full body MRI
If an alternate imaging modality must be used, the following guidelines should be followed:
•If a methodology other than a Tech-99m bone scan is used for a baseline or post-baseline 
assessment, then that same methodology must be used at all subsequent assessment time points, 
regardless of the availability of Tech-99m.
•If a Tech-99m bone scan assessment reveals an unconfirmed progression and your imaging 
facility indicates that Tech-99m may not be available 6 or more weeks later for the 
confirmatory follow-up scan, then an addi tional full body scan using an alternate methodology 
should be pe rformed at first progression in order to ensure that the same scanning methodology 
will be available at both time points.

5.5.3 Disease Progression Criteria
At each disease assessment, progression (PD) will be determined using the criteria in Table 5.5.3-
1and Table 5.5.3-2 . These criteria are based on RECIST v1.1 for soft tissue lesions and PCWG2 
for bone lesions and PSA measurements. 
For Cohort D participants, sites should submit all scans to the central imaging vendor on a rolling 
basis, throughout the duration of the study. BICR of scans will occur on a rolling basis, blinded to 
treatment arm, clinical data, and investigator a ssessment of submitted scans. When progression 
per RECIST v1.1 criteria for soft tissue lesions and PCWG2 for bone lesions is assessed by the 
investigator, th e site will i nform the central imaging vendor, in order fo r BICR assessment of 
progression to be performed. The BICR will be completed and the results provided to the site as 
specified in the imaging vendor documents, provided there are no pending imaging queries to the 
site. All details on the timelines and associated process requiremen ts will be outlined in the 
CA209650 Imaging Manual.  
Cohort D participants whose progression is not confirmed by the BICR w ill be required to continue 
tumor assessments (if clinically feasible) according to the protocol-specified schedule, or sooner 
if clinically indicated. Also, if Cohort D particip ants discontinue treatment without radiographic 
progression, tumor assessments will continue according to the protocol specified schedule, as 
noted in the Schedule of Activities, until progression has been confirmed by BICR or treatment is 
discontinued, whichever occurs later.
All study treatment decisions will be based on th e investigator’s assessment of tumor images and 
not on the BICR assessment.Radiographic Progression in soft tissue lesions (Target lesions, Non-target (non-bone) lesions) 
and Bone lesions are described in Table 5.5.3-1 below:

are documented at or beyond Week 13. 
PSA progression alone is not an indication to stop treatment. Rather , subjects must discontinue 
treatment upon radiographic progression per RECIST v 1.1 criteria for soft tissue disease and/or 
PCWG2 criteria for bone disease (see Table 5.5.3-1 above).
Participant who discontinue treatment without documented radiographic progression will continue

5.8 Outcomes Research Assessments
The evaluation of patient-reported outcomes is an  increasingly important aspect of clinical efficacy 
in oncology trials. Such data provide an understanding of the impact of treatment from the 
participant’s perspective and offer insights into patient experience that may not be captured through physician reporting. Additionally, generic health-related quality of life measures provide data needed for calculating utility valu es to inform health economic models.
For Cohort D, participants will be asked to complete the Brief Pain Inventory - Short Form 
(BPI-SF), The Functional Assessment Of Cancer Therapy - Prostate Cancer (FACT-P), and the 3-level version of the EuroQol Group’s EQ-5D (EQ-5D-3L) in the participant’s preferred language 
when available. The assessments will be given at screening, before any clinical activities are 
performed during on-study clinic visits, and at designated visits during the follow-up phase. For 
Cohorts A, B, and C, the FACT-P will not be ad ministered at any timepoint. Before administering 
the first patient-reported assessment after randomization, the Investigator should confirm that the 
participant is aware of their treatment assignment. If exceptional circumstances preclude the continued administration of measures using planned modalities, then altern ate administration 
methods may be required after consultation with a sponsor or a sponsor’s representative.
5.8.1 The Brief Pain Inventory - Short Form
The BPI-SF
133measures both pain severity and functional interference caused by pain through the 
use of a numerical rating scale. Subjects rate the severity of their pain at its ‘‘worst,’’ ‘‘least,’’ and 
‘‘average’’ in the last 24 hours using an 11-point  numerical rating scale with anchors of ‘‘no pai n’’ 
and ‘‘pain as bad as you can imagine.’’ They are also asked to rate their pain at the time they complete the BPI-SF. Using an 11-point numerical rating scale with anchors of ‘‘does not 
interfere’’ and ‘‘completely inte rferes,’’ the BPI-SF similarly assesses to what extent pain 
interferes with mood, walking, general activity, work, relations with others, sleep, and enjoyment 
of life. The BPI-SF also asks subjects to mark the location of their pain on a body drawing and includes additional questions regarding pain treatment and the extent of pain relief. The original instrument on which the BPI-SF is based, The Wisconsin Brief Pain Questi onnaire, was developed 
and validated in oncology subjects with the following four tumor types: breast, prostate, colorectal, 
and gynecological.
134The BPI-SF has been validated in cancer subjects in several countries with 
psychometrically validated translations in over 25 countries.

5.8.2 The Functional Assessment Of Cancer Therapy - Prostate Cancer 
(FACT-P)
The FACT-P is a multidimensional, self-report Qo L instrument specifically designed for use with 
prostate cancer patients.135It consists of 27 core items, the Functional Assessment of Cancer 
Therapy - General (FACT-G) questionnaire, which assesses patient function in 4 domains: 
Physical, Social/Family, Emotional, and Functional well-being, which is further supplemented by 
the Prostate Cancer Subscale (PCS), 12 diseas e-specific items to assess for prostate-related 
symptoms. Each item is rated on a 0 (Not at all) to 4 (Very much) Likert type scale, and then 
combined to produce subscale scores for each domain, a Trial Outcome Index (TOI) which is based on the Physical and Functional well-being scales and the PCS as well as a total score which ranges from 0 to 156. Higher scores represent better QoL.
5.8.3 The 3-level EQ-5D-3L
The EQ-5D-3L
136is a standardized instrument used to m easure self-reports of health status and 
functioning. The instrument’s descriptive system consists of 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, 
usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 3 levels, reflecting 
"no health problems," "moderate health problems,"  and "extreme health problems." A dimension 
for which there are no problems is said to be at level 1, wh ile a dimension for which there are 
extreme problems is said to be at level 3. T hus, the vectors 11111 and 33333 represent the best 
health state and the worst health s tate, resp ectively, described by the EQ-5D-3L. Altogether, the 
instrument describes 35= 243 health states. Empirically derived weights can be applied to an 
individual’s responses to the EQ-5D-3L descriptive system to generate an index measuring the value to society of his or her current health. Such preference-weighting systems have been 
developed for Japan, UK, US, Spain, Germany, and numerous other populations. In addition, the EQ-5D-3L includes a visual analog scale (VAS) that allows respondents to rate their own current health on a 100-point s cale ranging from “best imaginable” to “worst imaginable” health.
5.9 Additional Research Collection
Additional research collections are mandatory for all participants, except where prohibited by local 
laws or regulations, ethics committees or where a waiver is provided by the BMS Study Director. 
Where one or more of these exceptions occurs, participation in the additional research collection 
should be encouraged but will not be a condition of  overall study participation, and subjects may 
opt out of the collection. This protocol will include residual sample storage for additional research 
(AR).
This collection for additional research is intended to expand the translational R&D capability at 
Bristol-Myers Squibb, and will support as yet undefined research aims that w ill adva nce our 
understanding of disease and options for treatment. It may also be used to support health authority 
requests for analysis, and advancement of pharmacodiagnostic development to better target drugs to the right subjects. This may also include genetic/genomic exploration aimed at exploring disease 
pathways, progression and response to treatment etc.

All requests for access to samples or data for a dditional research will be vetted through a diverse 
committee of the study sponsor’s senior leaders in Research and Development to ensure the 
research supports appropriate and well-def ined scientific research activities.
•Additionally, residual blood and tissue co llections will also be retained by the BMS 
Biorepository  at a BMS approved third party storage management facility 
for additional research purposes
•Additional research samples will be retained for 15 years or the maximum allowed by 
applicable law. No additional sampling is required for residual co llections
Further details of sample collection and processing w ill be provided to the site in the procedure 
manual.
5.10 Health Economics OR Medical Resource Utilization and Health 
Economics
Healthcare resource utilization data will be collected for all randomized participants in Cohort D 
using an internal CRF developed for use in previous trials. The form, which is completed by study 
staff, records information about hospital admissions, including the number of days spent in various 
wards and discharge diagnosis, and non-protocol sp ecified visits related to st udy thera py, including 
date of visit, reason for visit, and type of vis it. The healthcare resource utilization data will be used 
to support subsequent economic evaluations.
6 ADVERSE EVENTS
An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any new untoward medical occurrence or worsening of a 
preexisting medical condition in a clinical investigation subject admin istered study treatment and 
that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be 
any unfavorable and unintended sign (such as an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of study tr eatment, wh ether or not considered related to 
the study treatment.
The causal relationship to study  treatment is determined by a physician and should be used to 
assess all adverse events (AE). The causal relationship can be one of the following:
•Related: There is a reasonable causal relations hip between study treatm ent administration and 
the AE.
•Not related: There is not a reasonable causa l relationship between study treatment 
administration and the AE. 
The term "reasonable causal relationship" means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship. 
Adverse events can be spontaneously reported or elicited duri ng open-ended questioning, 
examination, or evaluation of a subject. (In order to prevent reporting bias, subjects should not be 
questioned regarding the specific occurrence of one or more AEs.)

Immune-mediated adverse events are AEs consistent with an immune-mediated mechanism or 
immune-mediated component for which non-inflammatory etiologies (eg, infection or tumor progression) have been ruled out. IMAEs can include events with an alternate etiology which were 
exacerbated by the induction of autoimmunity . Information supporting the assessment w ill be 
collected on the participant’s case report form.
Sponsor or designee w ill be reporting adverse events to regu latory authorities and ethics 
committees according to local applicable laws including European Directive 2001/20/EC and FDA 
Code of Federal Regulations 21 CFR Parts 312 and 320.Events Meeting the AE Definition
•Any abnormal laboratory test results (hematology , clinical chemistry, or urinalysis) or results 
from other safety assessments (eg, ECG, radiological scans, vital signs measurements), 
including those that worsen from baseline, considered clinically significant in the medical and 
scientific judgment of the investigator. Note that abnormal lab tests or other safety assessments 
should only be reported as AEs if the final diagnosis is not available. Once the final diagnosis 
is known, the reported term should be updated to be the diagnosis.
•Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre-existi ng condition including eit her an increase in 
frequency and/or intensity of the condition.
•New conditions detected or diagnosed after st udy intervention administration even th ough it 
may have been present before the start of the study.
•Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected drug-drug interaction.
•Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study intervention 
or a concomitant medication. Ove rdose, as a verbatim term (as reported by the investigator), 
should not be reported as an AE/SAE unless it is an intentional overdose taken with possible suicidal/self-harming intent. Such overdoses should be reported regardless of sequelae and 
should specify "intentional overdose" as the verbatim term
Events NOT Meeting the AE Definition
•Medical or surgical procedure (eg, endoscopy, appendectomy): the condition that leads to the 
procedure is the AE.
•Situations in which an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or convenience admission to a hospital).
6.1 Serious Adverse Events
DEFINITION OF SAE
If an event is not an AE per definition above, th en it cannot be an SAE even if serious conditions 
are met.
A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:
•results in death

•is life-threatening (defined as an event in which the subject was at risk of death at the time of 
the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe)
•requires inpatient hospitalization or causes prolongation of existing hospitalization (see NOTE
below)
•results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity
•is a congenital anomaly/birth defect
•is an important medical event (defined as a medical event(s) that may not be immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospi talization but, ba sed upon appropriate medical and 
scientific judgment, may jeopardize the s ubject or may require intervention [eg, medical, 
surgi cal] to prevent one of the other serious outcomes listed in the definition above.) Examples 
of such events include, but are not limited to, intensive treatment in an emergency room or at 
home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or co nvulsions that do not result in 
hospitalization.) Potential drug induced liver injury (DILI) is also considered an important 
medical event. (See  Section 6.6 for the definition of potential DILI.)
Suspected transmission of an infectious ag ent (eg, pathogenic or nonpathogenic) via the study 
treatment is an SAE. 
Although pregna ncy, overdose, cancer, and potential drug induced liver inju ry (DILI) are not 
always serious by regulatory definition, thes e events must be handled as SAEs. (See Section 6.1.1
for reporting pregnancies).
Any component of a study endpoint that is consider ed related to study therapy should be reported 
as SAE (eg, death is an endpoint, if death occurred due to anaphylaxis, anaphylaxis must be 
reported) (see Section 6.1.1 for reporting details).
NOTE : 
The following hospitalizations are not considered SAEs in BMS clinical studies: 
−a visit to the emergency room or other hospital department < 24 hours, that does not result 
in admission (unless considered an important medical or life-threatening event)
−elective surgery, planned prior to signing consent
−admissions as per protocol for a planned medical/surgical procedure
−routine h ealth assessment re quiring admission for baseline/trending of health s tatus 
(eg, routine colonoscopy)
−medical/surgical admission other than to remedy ill h ealth and planned prior to entry into 
the study. Appropriate documen tation is required in these cases
−admission encountered for another life circumstance that carries no bearing on health status 
and requires no medical/surgical intervention (e g, lack of housing, economic inadequacy, 
caregiver respite, family circumstances, administrative reason)
−Admission for administration of anticancer therapy in the absence of any other SAEs

EVALUATING AES AND SAES
Assessment of Causality
•The investigator is obligated to assess the relationship between study intervention and each 
occurrence of each AE/SAE.
•A “reasonable possibility” of a relationship conveys that there are facts, evidence, and/or 
arguments to suggest a causal relationship, rath er than a relationship cannot be ruled out.
•The investigator will use clinical j udgment to determine the relationship.
•Alternative causes, such as underlying disease(s), concomitant therapy, and other risk factors, as well as the tem poral relationship of the event to st udy intervention administr ation will be 
considered and investigated.
•The investigator will also consult the Investigator’s Brochure (IB) and/or Product Information, 
for marketed products, in his/her assessment.
•For each AE/SAE, the investigator must document in the medical notes that he/she has reviewed the AE/SAE and has provided an assessment of causality.
•There may be situations in which an SAE has occurred and the investigator has minimal 
information to include in the initial re port to Sponsor. However, it is very important that the 
investigator always make an assessment of causality for every event before the initial 
transmission of the SAE data to Sponsor.
•The investigator may change his/her opinion of causality in light of follow-up information and 
send a SAE follow-up report with the updated causality assessment.
•The causality assessment is one of the criteria used when determining regulatory reporting requirements.
6.1.1 Serious Adverse Event Collection and Reporting
Sections 5.6.1 and 5.6.2 in the Investigator Brochure (IB) represent the Reference Safety 
Information to determine expectedness of seri ous adverse events fo r expedited reporting. 
Following the subject’s written consent to particip ate in the study, all SAEs, whether related or not 
related to study tr eatment, must be collected, including those thought to be associated with 
protocol-specified procedures. All SAEs must be collected that occur during the screening period 
and within 100 days of the last dose of study treatment. 
The investigator must report any SAE that occurs after these time periods and that is believed to 
be related to study drug or protocol-specified procedure. An SAE report must be completed for any event where doubt exists regarding its seriousness. 
If the investigator believes that an SAE is not rel ated to study treatment, but is potentially related 
to the conditions of the study (such as withdrawal of previous therapy or a complication of a study 
procedure), the relationship must be specified in the narrative section of the SAE Report Form.
All SAEs associated with confirmed or suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection must be collected from 
the date of the participant’s written consent until 100 days following discontinuation of dosing.

SAEs, whether related or not r elated to study treatment, and pregnancies must be reported to BMS 
(or designee) within 24 hours of awareness of the event. SAEs must be recorded on the SAE Report 
Form; pregnancies on a Pregnancy Surveillance Form  (electronic or paper forms). The required 
method for SAE data reporting co llection is t hrough the eCRF. The paper SAE/pregnancy 
surveillance forms are only intended as a back-up option when the eCRF system is not functioning.
When paper forms are used, the original paper form s are to remain on site. In this case, the paper 
forms are to be transmitted via email or confirmed facsimile (fax) transmission to:
SAE Email Address: Refer to Contact Information list.
SAE Facsimile Number: Refer to Contact Information list.
For studies capturing SAEs through electronic data cap ture (EDC), electronic submission is the 
required method for reporting. In the event the el ectronic system is unavailable for transmission, 
paper forms must be used and submitted immediatel y. When paper forms are used, the original 
paper forms are to remain on site.
SAE Telephone Contact (required for SAE and pregnancy reporting): Refer to Contact 
Information list.
Follow-up of AEs and SAEs
If only limited information is initially available, follow-up reports are required. (Note: Follow-up 
SAE reports must include the same investigator term(s) initially reported.) 
If an ongoing SAE changes in its intensity or relationship to study tr eatment or if new information 
becomes available, the SAE report must be updated and submitted within 24 hours to BMS (or 
designee) using the same procedure used for transmitting the initial SAE report.
After the initial AE/SAE report, the investigat or is required to proactively follow each participant 
at subsequent visits/contacts. All SAEs, non-ser ious AEs of special interest, and AEs (SAEs and 
non-serious AEs) associated with confirmed or suspected SARS-CoV-2 inf ection will be followed 
until resolution, the condition stabilizes, the event is otherwise explained, the event is deemed 
irreversible, the participant is lost to follow-up (as defined in Section 3.6.2 ) or for suspected cases, 
until SARS-CoV-2 infection is ruled-out.
All SAEs must be followed to resolution or stabilization.
BMS will be reporting adverse events to regulatory authorities and ethics committees according to 
local applicable laws including European Di rective 2001/20/EC and FDA Code of Federal 
Regulations 21 CFR Parts 312 a nd 320. A SUSAR (Suspected, Unexpected Serious Adverse 
Reaction) is a subset of SAEs and will be reported to the appropriate regulatory authorities and investigators following local and global guidelines and requirements.

6.2.1 Nonserious Adverse Event Collection and Reporting
The collection of nonserious AE information (wit h the exception of non-serious AEs related to 
SARS-CoV-2 infection) should begin at initiation of study treatment. Nonser ious AE information 
should also be collected from the start of a placebo lead-in period or other observational period 
intended to establish a baseline status for the subjects. 
Nonserious AEs should be followed to resolution or stab ilization, or reported as SAEs if they 
become serious (see Section 6.1.1 ). Follow-up is also required for nonserious AEs that cause 
interruption or discontinuation of study treatment and for those present at the end of study 
treatment as appropriate. All identified nonserious AEs must be recorded and described on the nonserious AE page of the CRF (paper or electronic). 
Completion of supplemental CRFs may be requested for AEs and/or laboratory abnormalities that 
are reported/identified during the course of the study.
All nonserious adverse events (not only those deemed to be treatment-related) should be collected 
continuously during the tr eatment period and for a minimum of 100 days following discontinuation 
of study treatment. 
All non-serious AEs associated with confirmed  or suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection must be 
collected from the date of the par ticipant’s written consent un til 100 days following 
discontinuation of dosing. Every adverse event must be assessed by the investigator with regard to 
whether it is considered immune-mediated. For events which are potentially immune-mediated, 
additional information will be collected on the subject’s case report form.
6.3 Laboratory Test Result Abnormalities
The following laboratory test result abnormalities  should be captured on the nonserious AE CRF 
page or SAE Report Form as appropriate. Paper forms are only intended as a back-up option when 
the electronic system is not functioning.
•Any laboratory test result that is clinically  significant or meets the definition of an SAE
•Any laboratory test result abnormality that required the subject to have study tr eatment
discontinued or interrupted
•Any laboratory test result abnormality that required the subject to r eceive specific corrective 
therapy
It is expected that wherever possible, the clinical rather than laboratory term would be used by the 
reporting investigator (eg, anemia versus low hemoglobin value).
6.4 Pregnancy
Not applicable.
Any pregnancy that occurs in a female partner of a male study participant should be re ported to 
Sponsor or designee. In order for BMS to collect any pregnancy surveillance information from the 
female partner, the female partner must sign an informed consent form for disclosure of this information. Information on this pregnancy will be collected on the Pregnancy Surveillance Form.

6.5 Overdose
An overdose is defined as the accidental or intentional administration of any dose of a product that 
is considered of both exce ssive and specifically important.
All occurrences of overdose must be reported as SAEs (see Section 6.1.1 for reporting details). 
6.6 Potential Drug Induced Liver Injury (DILI)
Wherever possible, ti mely confirmation of initial liv er-related laboratory abnormalities s hould 
occur prior to the reporting of a potential DILI event. All occurrences of potential DILIs, meeting 
the defined criteria, must be reported as SAEs (see Section 6.1.1 for reporting details).
Potential drug induced liver injury is defined as: 
1) AT (ALT or AST) elevation > 3 times upper limit of normal (ULN)
AND
2) Total bilirubin > 2 times ULN, without init ial findings of cholestasis ( elevated serum alkaline 
phosphatase)
AND
3) No other immediately a pparent possible causes of AT elevation and hyperbilirubinemia, 
including, but not limited to, viral hepatitis, pre-existing chronic or acute liver disease, or the 
administration of other drug(s) known to be hepatotoxic
6.7 Other Safety Considerations
Any significant worsening noted during interim or final physical examinations, electrocardiogram, 
x-ray filming, any other potential safety assessment required or not required by protocol should 
also be recorded as a nonserious or serious AE, as appropriate, and reported accordingly.

8.1 Sample Size Determination
Sample size determination for Cohorts B and C:
Approximately 90 subjects with mCRP C will be enro lled and treated in 2 cohorts, subjects who
must have progressed after second-generation hormon e therapies but have not received cytotoxic 
chemotherapy, and subjects who have progressed following cytotoxic chemotherapy (Cohorts B 
and C, respectively). Each c ohort w ill consist of 30 or more sub jects with measurable disease at 
baseline per RECIST v1.1 and no more than 15 with non-measurable disease.

This open-label Phase 2 study is not designed to  statistically test specific hypotheses. Therefore,
the sample size is not based on s tatist ical power calculations, but  the size in each c ohort is 
calculated using the observed objective response rate among treated subjects with measurable 
disease at baseline. 
Sample size determination for Cohort D:
Approximately 259 subjects with mCRPC, previous ly treated with docetaxel, will be rando mized
and treated in Cohort D. These 259 subjects will be rando mized between 4 arms in a 2:2:1:2 ratio
(74, 74, 37, and 74 subjects in Arm D1, D 2, D3, and D4, respectively) and stratified by 
presence/absence of measurable disease by RECIS T v1.1 per investigator assessment. Subjects 
with non-measurable disease at baseline b y RECIST v1.1 per investigator assessment w ill be 
capped when approximately 105 subjects are randomi zed so that the rem aining 154 subjects (44, 
44, 22, and 44 subjects in Arm D1, D2, D3, and D4, respectively) will be with measurable disease 
at baseline. 
Because this open-label phase 2 study is not de signed to statist ically test specific hypotheses, the 
sample size of Cohort D is not based on s tatist ical power calculations.

8.2 Endpoints
8.2.1 Dual Primary EndpointsObjective Response Rate (ORR)
In Cohorts B and C, objective response rate (ORR) is defined as the proportion of subjects who 
had confirmed complete or par tial best overall res ponse (BOR) among treated subjects with 
measurable disease at baseline. In Cohort D, ORR is  defined as the proportion of subjects who had 
confirmed complete or partial BOR among rando mized subjects with measurable disease at 
baseline by RECIST v1.1 per investigator assessmen t as entered in IWRS. For Cohorts B and C, 
the BOR is assessed by BICR (BICR assessment will be performed retrospectively in Cohorts A, 
B, and C, and prospectively in Cohort D) and is recorded between the date of treatment initiation 
and the date of objectively documented progression per RECIST v1.1 or the date of subsequent 
systemic anti-cancer therapy, whichever occurs first. For Cohort D, the BOR is assessed by BICR 
and is recorded between th e date of rando mization and the d ate of ob jectively documented 
progression per RECIST v1.1 or the date of subseque nt systemic anti-cancer therapy, whichever 
occurs first. For subjects without documen ted progression or s ubsequent therapy, all available 
response assessments will contribute to the BOR assessment. Tumor assessments are scheduled to be performed every 8 weeks (± 7 days) for 6 month s since treatment initiation and thereafter every 
12 weeks (± 7 days). In Cohorts A, B, and C, tumor a ssessments continue until radiographic disease 
progression is documented by the investigator or tr eatment is discontinued (whichever occurs 
later). In Cohort D, tumor assessments continue until radiographic progression is documented by the investigator and confirmed by BICR or treatment is discontinued (whichever occurs later).
Radiographic Progression-Free Survival
The following progressive diseases will be collected and documented as assessed as noted below:
•Radiographic progression per BICR assessment
1) Bone disease progression by PCWG2 
2) Non-bone soft tissue dis ease progression by RECIST v1.1 
•Clinical progression per investigator assessment
1) Need for palliative rad iation therapy involving more than one site, OR
2) Surgery of kyphoplasty to any neoplastic lesion, OR 3) Cancer-associated clinical deterioration as determined by the treating physician.
The following censoring rules will be used to define PFS endpoints for analysis. 
i. Subjects who did not progress or die will be censored on the date of their last evaluable 
tumor assessment (ie, bone scan, CT, MRI).

ii. Subjects who did not have any on study tumor assessments and did not die will be censored 
on their date of first treatment if they are in Cohorts B and C, and will be censored on their 
date of randomization if they are in Cohort D.
iii. Subjects who receive subse quent systemic anti-cancer therapy prior to progression (or 
death) will be censored.
In Cohorts B and C, the radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS) is defined as the time 
between the date of first treatment and the first d ate of documented progression per BICR 
(radiographic a-b) or death due to any cause, whichever  occurs first. In Cohort D, the radiographic 
progression-free survival (rPFS) is defined as the time between the date of rando mization and the 
first date of documented progression per BICR (radiographic a-b) or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. The censoring rules (i-ii) will be applied for primary analyses; as shown 
above in type of progressive disease and censoring rule. In addition, rPFS with censoring subsequent therapy will also be defined for a sensitivity analysis, ie, the censoring rules (i-iii) will 
be applied.
8.2.2 Secondary Endpoint(s)
Radiographic/Clinical Progression-Free Survival
In Cohorts B and C, the radiographic/clinic al progression-free s urvival (rcPFS) is defined as the 
time between the date of first treatment and th e first date of documented progression (r adiographic 
a-b; clinical c-e) or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. In Cohort D, rcPFS is defined 
as the time between the date of randomization and the fi rst date of documented progression 
(radiographic a-b; clinical c-e) or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. The censoring 
rules (i-ii) and (i-iii) will be applied, respectively  (ie, without and with censoring for subsequent 
therapy); see type of progressive disease and censoring rule in Section 8.2.1 .
Overall Survival
In Cohorts B and C, , overall survival (OS) is defined as the time from first treatment to the date of 
death from any cause. In Cohort D, overall survival (OS) is defined as the time from ra ndomization 
to the date of death from any cause. For subjects who are alive, their survival time will be censored 
at the last known alive date. Over all survival w ill be censored fo r subjects at the date of first 
treatment if they had no follow-up.
Safety and Tolerability
Overall safety and tolerability will be measured by th e incidence of adverse events, serious adverse 
events, adverse events leading to disconti nuation, immune mediated adverse events, deaths, 
laboratory abnormalities a nd changes from baseline.
Outcomes Research Assessments
The endpoints of changes pain as measured by BPI-SF, changes in cancer-related symptoms and 
quality of life (QoL) using the FACT-P questionnaire, and changes in health s tatus and h ealth 
utility as measured by the EQ-5D-3L questionnaire are described in Section 8.2.9 . The analysis of

PSA response rate
PSA response rate (PSA-RR) is the proportion of part icipants with a 50% or greater decrease in 
PSA from baseline to the lowest post-baseline PSA result. A second consecutive value obtained 3 
or more weeks later is required to confirm the PSA response. PSA response will be calculated for 
all participants with PSA values at baseline and at least one post baseline assessment. The analysis 
of PSA-RR will be based on all treated subjects with PSA values at baseline and at least one post-baseline assessment for Cohorts B and C, and on all randomized subjects for Cohort D with PSA 
values at baseline and at least one post-baseline assessment.

For the dual primary endpoint of ORR, estimated rates and corresponding 95% exact CIs will be 
calculated using the Clopper-Pearson method for all tr eated sub jects with measurable disease at 
baseline per RECIST v 1.1 in Cohorts B and C and for all ra ndomized subjects with measurable 
disease at baseline per RECIST v1.1 per investigator assessment as entered in IWRS in Cohort D. In Cohorts B and C, estimated odds ratios and differences and corresponding 95% CIs between cohorts w ill be calculated for descriptive purpose. In Cohort D, sensitivity analysis of ORR may 
also be performed for all randomized subjects with measurable disease at baseline as entered in 
the CRF if the discrepancy rate is higher than 5%.
For time to event endpoints (eg, rPFS, rcPFS, and OS), medians and rates at months 6 and 12 and 
corresponding 95% CIs w ill be es timated for each cohort via the Kaplan-Meier met hodology for 
all treated subjects in Cohorts B  and C, and simila r analyses will be done for each treatment arm
for all randomized subjects in Cohort D. Kaplan-Meier  plots will be presented for each cohort for 
Cohorts B and C; similarly, Kaplan-Meier plots will be displayed by tr eatment arm for all 
randomized subjects in C ohort D. Note that these analyses will be stratified by the stratification 
factor when these are conducted for Cohort D. 
Estimate of PSA-RR and corresponding 2-sided exact 95% CI using the Clopper-Pearson method 
will be performed on all tr eated sub jects with PSA values at baseline and at least one post-baseline 
assessment for Cohorts B and C; similar analysis will be done for each treatment arm in Cohort Dwith PSA values at baseline and at least one post-baseline assessment. Note that this analysis will 
be stratified by the stratification factor when conducted for Cohort D.
For all tr eated subjects with measurable diseas e at baseline in Cohorts B and C,  w ill be 
summarized by cohort for subjects with a BOR of PR or CR using the Kaplan-Meier methodology. 
Median values, along with two-sided 95% CIs will also be calculated. Summary statistics of

measurable disease at baseline by RECIST v1.1 per investigator assessment as entered in IWRS
in Cohort D, s imilar  a nd analyses will be repeated by treatment arm.
8.2.6 Safety Analyses
For Cohorts A, B, and C, all the safety analyses will be performed by cohort and total (including 
treated sub jects in Cohort A) for all tr eated subjects. Descriptive statistics of safety w ill be 
presented using the NCI CTCAE v4 by cohort and total. All AEs, drug-related AEs, SAEs and 
drug-related SAEs w ill be tabulated using the worst grade per NCI CTCAE v 4 by system organ 
class and preferred term. On-study lab parameters including hematology, coagulation, chemistry, 
liver function, thyroid, adrenal and renal function will be su mmarized using worse grade by NCI 
CTCAE v 4. In addition, immune mediated adverse events incident rate is defined as the proportion 
subjects with any grade adverse events among subjects treated by each cohort and total. Events 
reported from the first dose and up to and including 100 days following the last dose of study 
treatment could be included in est imating this incidence rate. For Cohort D, similar safety analyses 
will be repeated by treatment arm for all  treated subjects.

9 STUDY MANAGEMENT
9.1 Compliance
9.1.1 Compliance with the Protocol and Protocol Revisions
The investigator should not implement any deviation or change to the protocol without prior 
review and documented approval/favorable opinion of an amendment from the IRB/IEC (and if 
applicable, also by local health authority) except where necessary to eliminate an immediate 
hazard(s) to st udy subjects. If a de viation or change to a protocol is imp lemented to eliminate an 
immediate hazard(s) prior to obtaining relevant approval/favorable opinion(s), the deviation or 
change will be submitted as soon as possible to:
•IRB/IEC 
•Regulatory Authority(ies), if applicable by local regulations per national requirements)
Documentation of approval/favorable opinion signed by the chairperson or designee of the 
IRB(s)/IEC(s) and if applicable, also by local health authority, must be sent to BMS. If an 
amendment substantially alters the study design or in creases the potential risk to the subject: (1) the 
consent form must be revised and submitted to the IRB(s)/IEC(s) for review and approval/favorable opinion; (2) the revised form mu st be used to obtain consent from subjects 
currently enrolled in the study if they are aff ected by the amendment; and (3) the new form must 
be used to obtain consent from new subjects prior to enrollment.
If the revision is done via an administrative letter, investigators must inform their IRB(s)/IEC(s).
9.1.2 Monitoring
Monitoring d etails describing strategy, including defini tion of study critical data items and 
processes (eg, risk-based initiatives in operati ons and quality such as risk management and 
mitigation strategies and analytical risk-b ased monitoring), methods, responsibilities, and 
requirements, including handling of noncomplian ce issues and monitoring techniques (central, 
remote, or on-site monitoring) are provided in the monitoring plan.
Representatives of BMS must be allowed to visit all study site locations periodically to assess the 
data quality and study integrity. On site they w ill review study records and directly compare them 
with source documents, discuss the conduct of the st udy with the investigator, and verify that the 
facilities r emain acceptable.
In addition, the study may be evaluated by BMS or designee internal a uditors and government 
inspectors who must be allowed access to CRFs, source documents, other study files, and study 
facilities. BMS audit reports will be kept confidential.
The investigator must notify BMS promptly of any inspections scheduled by regu latory aut horities, 
and promptly forward copies of inspection reports to BMS or designee.

9.1.2.1 Source Documentation
The Investigator is responsible for ensuring that the source data are accurate, legible, 
contemporaneous, original and attributable, whether  the data are hand-written on paper or entered 
electronically. If source data are created (first entered), modified, maintained, archived, retrieved, 
or transmitted electronically via computer ized systems (and/or any other kind of electronic 
devices) as part of regulated clinical trial activities, such systems must be compliant with all 
applicable laws and regulations governing use of electronic records and/ or electronic signatures. 
Such systems may include, but are not limited to, electronic medical/health records (EMRs/EHRs), 
adverse event tracking/reporting, protocol re quired assessments, and/or drug accountability 
records).
When paper records from such systems are used in place of electronic format to perform regulated 
activities, such paper records should be certified copies. A certified copy consists of a copy of original information that has been verified, as indicated by a dated signature, as an exact copy 
having all of the same attributes and i nformation as the original.
9.2 Records
9.2.1 Records Retention
The investigator (or head of the study site in  Japan) must retain all st udy records and source 
documents for the maximum period required by applicable regulations and guidelines, or 
institution procedures, or for the period specified  by BMS or designee, whichever is longer. The 
investigator (or head of the study site in Japan) must contact BMS or designee prior to destroying 
any records associated with the study.
BMS or designee will notify the investigator (or head of the study site in Japan) when the study 
records are no longer needed.
If the investigator withdraws from the study (eg, relocation, retirement), the records sh all be 
transferred to a mutually agreed upon designee (eg, another investigator, study site, IRB). Notice 
of such transfer will be given in writing to BMS or designee.
9.2.2 Study Treatment Records
Records for IP (whether supplied by BMS, its vendor s, or the site) must substantiate IP integrity 
and traceability from receipt, preparation, administrati on, and through destruction or return.

9.2.3 Case Report Forms
An investigator is required to prepare and maintain adequate and accurate case histories designed 
to record all observations and other d ata pertinent to the investig ation on each i ndividual treated 
or entered as a control in the investigation. Data that are derived from source documents and 
reported on the CRF must be consistent with the source documents or the discrepancies must be 
explained. Additional clinical information may be collected and analyzed in an effort to enhance 
understanding of product safety. CRFs may be reque sted for AEs and/or laboratory abnormalities 
that are reported or identified during the course of the study.
For sites using the Sponsor or designee elect ronic data capture tool, electronic CRFs w ill be 
prepared for all data collection fields except for fields specific to SAEs and pregnancy, which will 
be reported on the electronic SAE form and Pregnancy Surveillance form, respectively. If 
electronic SAE form is not av ailable, a paper SAE form can be used. Spaces may be left blank

10 GLOSSARY OF TERMS
Term Definition
Complete AbstinenceComplete Abstinence is defined as complete avoidance of heterosexual 
intercourse and is an acceptable form of contraception for all study drugs. 
This also means that abstinence is the preferred and usual lifestyle of the 
patient. This does not mean periodic abstinence (eg, calendar, ovulation, 
symptothermal, profession of abstinence for entry into a clinical trial, post-
ovulation methods) and withdrawal, which are not acceptable methods of 
contraception. Women must continue to have pregnancy tests. Acceptable 
alternate methods of highly or less effective contraception’s must be 
discussed in the event that the subject chooses to forego complete abstinence.

APPENDIX 1 MANAGEMENT ALGORITHMS
These general guidelines constitute guidance to the Investigator and may be supplemented by 
discussions with the Medical Monitor represe nting the Sponsor. The guidance applies to all 
immuno-oncology agents and regimens.
A general principle is that differential diagnoses should be diligently evaluated according to 
standard medical practice. No n-inflammatory etiologies s hould be consider ed and appropriately 
treated.
Corticosteroids are a primary th erapy for immuno-oncology drug-related adverse events. The oral 
equivalent of the recommended IV doses may be considered for ambulatory patients with low-
grade toxicity. The lower bioavailability of oral corticosteroids s hould be taken into account when 
switching to the equivalent dose of oral corticosteroids.
Consultation with a medical or s urgical specialist, especially prior to an invasive diagnostic or 
therapeutic procedure, is recommended.The frequency and severity of the related adverse events covered by these algorithms will depend 
on the immuno-oncology agent or regimen being used.

APPENDIX 3 WOMEN OF CHILDBEARING POTENTIAL DEFINITIONS AND 
METHODS OF CONTRACEPTION
DEFINITIONS
Woman of Childbearing Potential (WOCBP)
A woman is considered fertile following menarche and until becoming post-menopausal unless 
permanently sterile. Permanent sterilization methods include hysterectomy, bilateral 
salpingectomy, and bilateral oophorectomy.
Women in the following categories are not considered WOCBP
•Premenarchal
•Premenopausal female with 1 of the following:
−Documented hysterectomy
−Documented bilateral salpingectomy
−Documented bilateral oophorectomy
Note: Documentation can come from the site personnel’s review of the participant’s medical 
records, medical examination, or medical history interview.
•Postmenopausal female
−A postmenopausal state is defined as 12 months of ame norrhea in a woman over age 
45 years in the absence of other biological or physiological causes. In addition, females 
under the age of 55 years must have a serum follicle stimulating hormone, (FSH) level 
> 40 mIU/mL to confirm menopause.
CONTRACEPTION GUIDANCE FOR FEMALE PARTICIPANTS OF CHILD BEARING 
POTENTIAL
One of the highly effective methods of contracep tion listed below is required during study duration 
and until the end of relevant systemic exposure, defined as 5 months after the end of study 
treatment. *

Highly Effective Methods That Are User Independent 
•Implantable pr ogestogen-only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of 
ovulationb
•Hormonal meth ods of contraception including oral contraceptive pills containing a 
combination of  estrogen and progesterone, vaginal ring, injectables, implants and 
intrauterine hormone-releasing system (IUS)c
•Intrauterine device (IUD)c
•Bilateral tubal occlusion
•Vasectomized partner 
A vasectomized partner is a highly effective contraception method provided that the partner 
is the sole male sexual partner of the WOCBP and the absence of sperm has been confirmed. 
If not, an additional highly effective method of contraception should be used. 
•Sexual abstinence
Sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if defined as refraining from 
heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the study drug. The 
reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the duration of the study 
and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the participant.
•It is not necessary to use any other method of contraception when complete abstinence is elected. 
•WOCBP participants who choose complete abstin ence must continue to have pregnancy 
tests, as specified in  Section 2. 
•Acceptable alternate methods of highly effective contraception must be discussed in the event that the WOCBP participants chooses to forego complete abstinence 
NOTES: 
aTypical use failure rates may differ from those when used consistently and correctly. Use should be consistent 
with local regulations regarding the use of contraceptiv e methods for participants participating in clinical studies. 
bHormonal contraception may be susceptible to interaction with the st udy drug, which may reduce the efficacy 
of the contraceptive method.  Hormonal contraception is permissible only when there is sufficient evidence that 
the IMP and other study med ications will not alter hormonal exposures such that contraception would be 
ineffective or result in increased exposures that could be potentially hazardous.  In this case, alternative methods of contraception should be utilized. 
cIntrauterine devices and intrauteri ne hormone releasing systems are acceptable methods of contraception in the 
absence of definitive drug interaction studies when horm one exposures from intrauter ine devices do not alter 
contraception effectiveness
Unacceptable Methods of Contraception*
•Male or female condom with or without spermicide.  Male and female condoms  cannot be 
used simultaneously
•Diaphragm with spermicide
•Cervical cap with spermicide
•Vaginal Sponge with spermicide
•Progestogen-only oral hormonal contraception, wh ere inhibition of ovulation is not the 
primary mechanism of action

CONTRACEPTION GUIDANCE FOR MALE PARTICIPANTS WITH PARTNER(S) OF 
CHILD BEARING POTENTIAL.
Male participants with female part ners of childbearing potential are eligible to participate if they 
agree to the following during the treatment and until the end of relevant systemic exposure.
•Inform any and all partner(s) of their participation in a clinical drug study and the need to 
comply with contraception instructions as directed by the investigator.
•Male participants are required to use a condom for study duration and until end of relevant 
systemic exposure defined as 7 months  after the end of study treatment.
•Female partners of males participating in the study to consider use of effective methods of 
contraception until the end of relevant systemic exposure, defined as 7 months after the end of 
treatment in the male participant.
•Male participants with a pregnant or breastfeedi ng partner must agree to remain abstinent from 
penile vaginal intercourse or use a male condo m during each episode of penile penetration 
during the treatment and until 7 months after the end of study treatment. 
•Refrain from donating sperm for the duration of the study treatment and until 7 months after 
the end of study treatment.

APPENDIX 5 REVISED PROTOCOL SUMMARY OF CHANGE HISTORY
Overall Rationale for the Revised Protocol 04, 26-Mar-2020
The purpose of this revision is to modify the maximum tumor sample age from 5 years to 1 year.
The study will allow submission of tumor samples obtained more than 1 year prior to e nrollment 
if collected in the metastatic setting and if approved by the BMS Medical Monitor/designee. 
Recent prostate cancer studies evaluating tumor biology across different settings have found that 
the frequencies of individual genetic alterations increase as the disease progresses, suggesting that 
tumor samples collected in the localized disease setting may not reflect the tumor biology at the time of study treatment. In addition, Revised Protocol 04 allows starting dose of cabazitaxel of 
20 mg/m
2to align with cabazitaxel labeling, clarifies the population for analyses in 
Cohort D-Part 1, clar ifies the exclusion criteria for prior pelvic radiotherapy, incorporates updated 
nivolumab clinical program protocol  standards, and makes mi nor clarifications fo r consistency 
throughout the document. Where applicable, secti ons in the synopsis ha ve been updated to align 
with the protocol section changes listed below.
Summary of key changes of Revised Protocol 04
Section Number & Title Description of Change Brief Rationale
Global changesReplaced ‘Amendment 02’ with ‘Revised 
Protocol 02’.The mention of Amendment 02 
was an error and was corrected 
to reference Revised Protocol 02
Where applicable “study drug” was 
updated to “study treatment”.Revised to align with the most 
recent language for BMS studies
Where applicable “co- primary endpoint(s)” 
was changed to “dual primary endpoint(s)”.To comply with HA’s guidance 
on the definition of multiple 
endpoints
Section 1.3.1, Primary 
Objectives, bullet item 2Revised bullet item 2. (Text changes are 
underlined).
• Assess Radiographic Progression Free 
Survival (rPFS) assessed by BICR in all 
treated subjects with mCRPC in Cohort B, 
C, D - Part 2 period and all randomized
subjects with mCRPC in Cohort D - Part 1 
period using RECIST V1.1 for soft tissue 
disease progression and PCWG2 for bone 
disease progression.To clarify that the population for 
analyses in Cohort D-Part 1 are 
all ‘randomized subjects’ since 
the study design is randomized.
Section 1.5.1, Overall 
Risk/Benefit Assessment for 
Additional Cohort D, bullet 
item 3Revised bullet item 3. (Text changes are 
underlined).
•Early interim reviews of safety and 
efficacy data will be performed by the 
Sponsor and participating investigators 
from the Study Steering Committee for 
Cohort D after the first 15 treated subjects 
for each arm have at least 8 weeks of 
follow-up after first dose and at least one

Overall Rationale for the Revised Protocol 03, 21-Feb-2019
Recent data from Cohorts B and C in CA209650 suggest that nivolumab in combination with 
ipilimumab is an active regimen in patients  with mCRPC, with potentially greater activity in 
patients with HRD mutations or higher TMB, but early toxicity limited the number of combination 
doses received. This global Revised Protocol 03 introduces the addition of Cohort D containing 4 
open-label treatment arms. These arms (Arm D1 and D2) include 2 different dosing schedules of 
nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab to identify a dose combination which reduces toxicity and increases the potential clinical benefit from the dual checkpoint inhibition. The 3rd arm (Arm D3) evaluates ipilimumab monotherapy to assess its c ontribution to the activity of the combination, 
and the 4th arm (D4) reference arm evaluates SOC cabazitaxel to allow for comparison with the immunotherapy regimens,  
 
 
In addition, this revised protoc ol introduces optional re-i nduction for subjects entered the 
maintenance period, incorporates language to de fine PSA response a nd progression acc ording to 
PCWG2, incorporates updated nivolumab clinical program protocol standards, and makes minor 
clarifications for consistency throughout the protocol document.

the option to receive 
nivolumab in combination

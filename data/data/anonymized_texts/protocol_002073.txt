 1.0 Introduction  
Patients with loc alized TNBC are preferably treated with systemic chemotherapy in the 
neoadjuvant setting (NACT) as this allows for close monitoring of response in the intact primary 
tumor and often results in ‘downstaging’ of tumors, which increases the feasibility of bre ast 
conserving surgery. The response to NACT at the time of surgical resection can be determined 
by measuring the amount of residual cancer remaining in the breast and draining lymph nodes 
during routine pathol ogic evaluation and is such a powerful indicat or of prognosis that the Food 
and Drug Administration (FDA) has recognized significant improvement in complete respo nse to 
neoadjuvant therapy  as a pathway to drug approval. Investigators at MDACC  have develope d 
and validated a scoring system known as the Residual Cancer Burden (RCB) to quantify the 
extent of residual disease remaining after NACT and surgical resection. [2] Approximately 50% of 
patients with  localized  TNBC treated with standard taxane/anthracycline -based NACT  will have 
either pathologic compete response ( pCR/RCB -0) or minimal residual disease (RCB -I) at the time 
of surgical resection and those patients have identical and exceptionally good long -term 
prognosis  (less than 10% risk of developing distant metastati c disease within 5 years) . 
Unfortunately, those with more  extensive residual disease (RCB -II or RCB -III) have a much worse 
prognosis, with 50% -80% of patients developing distant metastatic disease w ithin 3 years of initial  
diagnosis. [3] Additionally, clinical trials of NACT in breast cancer have demonstrated that patients 
without response to their first chemoth erapeutic regimen have very low chance (5%) of achieving 
pCR after their second neoadjuvant che motherapy regimen. [4] However, this has not been the 
case with t argeted regimens such as trastuzumab in HER2+ tum ors, suggesting that intrinsic 
resistance to chemotherapy can be overcome with appropriate targeted therapy. [5] Though 
several targeted agents have been tested for treatment in TNBC, so far none have been 
successful. The underlying causes of this failure are commonly attributed to the molecular 
heterogeneity of tumors classified within the ‘catch all’ category of TNBC as well as the dilution 
effects of chemotherapy sensitive disease which requires clinical trials to enroll larger number of 
patients to show ben efit of combined targeted therapy/chemotherapy regimens over standard 
chemotherapy. Additionally, clonal selecti on of resistant cells with escape mechanisms also likely 
develops.  Recent advances in gene expression profiling have identified subgroups of tri ple-
negative breast cancer (TNBC) with distinct molecular features that, if appropriately selected, 
may be more responsive to targeted therapy with existing FDA -approved drugs, leading to rapid 
improvement of outcomes in this high -risk breast cancer popula tion[1, 6-8].  
 
Prediction of chemosensitivity and molecular aberrations associated with TNBC subtypes:  Our 
collaborator, Dr. Symmans, and his team have developed gene expression array -based 
predictive signatures of chemothera py response using fresh 
primary tumor tissue obtained from a routine biopsy of breast 
cancer at t he time of diagnosis or surgery. This approach  has 
been retrospectively validated and tested for feasibility using a 
prospective registry study (MDACC clinical  trial 2011 -0007). [9] 
The proposed predictor was tested on an independent cohort of 
breast ca ncers irrespective of receptor status (N=198, 99% with 
clinical Stage II -III) who received neoadjuvant (N=180) or 
adjuvant (N=18) taxane -anthracycline chemotherapy. 
Predictions were accurate if ER+/HER2 - (30% predicted 
sensitive, DRFS 97%, CI 91 -100; ARR 1 1%, CI 0.1 -21) or ER -
/HER2 - (26% predicted sensitive, DRFS 83%, CI 68 -100; ARR 
26%, CI 4 -48) (Fig 1). [9] Predicted treatment sensitivity was 
significantly associated with lower relapse risk (HR 0.19, CI 
0.07-0.55) in a multivariate model i ncluding ER status, tumor 
and nodal s tage, grade, age, and type of taxane treatment 
(paclitaxel or docetaxel).  
 
As important as predicting chemosensitivity may be, outcomes 
for will not be improved unless targeted therapy is developed for

 patients with che moresistant TNBC . Recent advances in gene expression  profiling have id entified 
subsets of TNBC (Fig. 2 ) with distinct molecular features that, if appropriately selected, may be 
more responsive to targeted therapy with existing FDA approved 
drugs. [1, 7, 10, 11] Basal -like TN BCs (BL1 and BL2) are heavily 
enriched in cell cycle and cell division pathways. Gene expression 
profiling has revealed that these tumors have high expression of 
proliferation genes such as aurora kinases, MYC , NRAS  and PLK1  
as well as elevated DNA damage response (BL1 subtype) . These 
tumors may have higher rates of pCR to standard chemotherapy 
compared to other TNBC subtypes. The BL2 subset displays gene 
ontologies involving growth factor signaling such as EGFR and 
IGF1R pat hways. Cell lines classified as basal -like had high rates 
of sensitivity to cisplatin and relative resistance to PI3K directed 
therapy in both cell culture and xenograft models. Though most 
triple -negative breast cancers are classified as basal -like (BL1 a nd 
BL2) by microarray analysis, approximately 30% of triple negative tumors are molecularly distinct 
from basal -like breast cancers as they display mesenchymal features, including enrichment in 
epithelial -to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and stem -cell like characteristics. Subgroups with 
these features have been identified by independent investigators and have been termed 
mesenchymal (M), mesenchymal -stem cell like (MSL) and claudin -low. Mesenchymal -like TNBCs 
carry a high rate of molecular aberrations that activate the PI3K/Akt/mTOR axis suggesting that 
this subgroup may be responsive to therapeutic regimens targeting this pathway. [1, 6, 7] 
Approximately 10 -15% of TNBC are associated with expression of androgen receptor (AR+ or 
LAR) and approximatel y 20-25% are immune modulatory (IM), expressing genes associated with 
immune activation. Approximately 10 -20% of patients with TNBC are carriers of germline 
BRCA1/2 mutations. When treated with NACT, pCR rates similar to slightly higher than non -
carriers. [12] BRCA1 and BRC A2 are required for homologous recombination repair of DNA 
strand breaks leading to a defect in DNA repair in cancers harboring such mutation s. As such, 
these tumors may be more sensitive to chemotherapy inducing DNA breaks or poly ADP -ribose 
polymerase (P ARP) inhibitors.   
 
Notably, investigators at MDACC also determined that rates of pCR/RCB -I to standard NACT 
were not statistically different  amongst the  TNBC  subtypes, though the lowest rates of pCR were 
seen in the BL -2 subtype and the highest rates of R CB-III disease was within the mesenchymal 
subtypes, further validating the need for both predictors of chemotherapy sensitivity as well as 
molecular characterization of predicted chemotherapy -insensitive disease to determine 
appropriate therapy for patient s with localized TNBC. [13]  
 
Given the disparity of treatment o utcomes from NACT for TNBC,  a molecular triaging protocol 
(MDACC 2014 -0185) has been 
developed and I RB approved as  a 
diagnostic platform to identify 
patients whose tumors are likely or 
unlikely to achieve pCR or RCB -I, 
in order to direct predicted 
responders toward standard 
chemotherapy and to direct 
predicted chemotherapy 
insensitive patients toward 
potentially more effective 
experimental therapies within 
clinical trials  (Figure 3 ). Previously 
untreated patients with localized 
TNBC who are candidates for 
standard NACT (anthracycline → 
taxane based therapy) will be

 enrolled into 2014 -0185, a  non-therapeut ic, randomized trial where they will undergo biopsy of 
the primary tumor for molecula r characterization within the MDACC CLIA certified diagnostic lab, 
including predicted sensitivity to chemotherapy using gene signatur es developed at MDACC . 
Patients will be randomized 2:1 for themselves and their care team to  either know  or not know  the 
results of the molecular characterization , which will be available  within 4 -6 weeks after biopsy.  All 
patients will be treated the same except for th e assignment of the  randomization (Figure 3).  The 
primary endpoint of this triage study is  to determine whether molecular profiling improves the 
overall outcome when used over and above standard indices to identify  patients for participation 
on clinical trials after the mid -point of NACT for those patients with predicted and /or apparent 
resista nce to the first phase of NACT for TNBC.  
 
All patients will then initiate a planned 4 cycles of sta ndard neoadjuvant anthracycline -based 
chemotherapy based upon physician’s choice (AC, dos e-dense AC, FAC, EC or FEC are all 
allowed) with assessment of response by diagnostic imaging after 4 cycles of therapy (or at the 
time of progression in patients who develop clinical evidence of disease progression on 
chemothera py). In our 
retrospective a nalysis of 
molecularly characterized 
patients with available 
diagnostic imaging, 
approximately 10 -15% of 
patients will have obvious, 
extreme discordance between 
volumetric measurement of 
tumor response by ultrasound 
after 4 cycle s of NACT and 
response pred iction by gene 
signature with the diagnostic 
imaging best predicting 
outcome  in these extreme 
cases of response or lack thereof (parameters outlined in Fig. 3) . As such, patients with 
discordant imaging/molecular predictor result s will be advised of these results and counseled to 
proceed based upon imaging. After response assessment, all patients will be offered the option of 
continuing forward with standard taxane (paclitaxel or docetaxel) or participation in clinical trials  
(Figure 4) . Molecular character ization of the tumor (if known) can  also be used  along with any 
other relevant factors  by the treating physician to select for clinical trials  within the BMO 
neoadjuvant clinical trials portfolio (Figure 4) . 
 
Additionally, becaus e of the 2:1 randomization in 2014 -0185  (Figure 3 ), a subgroup of patients 
molecula rly profiled will not know the  results for decision making (control arm). Like the 
experimental arm, p atients on the control arm will be allowed to choose between study 
participation or to receive sta ndard chemotherapy with paclitaxel based regimen for 12 additional 
weeks  based on standard clinical indices . Essentia lly, those who do not know the  results of the 
molecular profiling are offered the same options as  those who do, they simply will not have t he 
molecular analysis to guide their decision making.  Since all patients enrolled  in 2014 -0185  have 
biopsies for molecular characterization and diagnostic ima ging, for research purposes all patients 
can be characterized as chemosensitive or chemoresistant  and further subtyped into the  TNBC 
molecular subtypes mentioned above. As such, those patients characterized with chemoresistant, 
subtype specific disease who  receive standard NACT with taxane -based regimens can be 
compared with matched patients treated on  clinical trials with phenotypically -matched targeted 
agents , such as DAE . Though this comparison will not be a randomized comparison, it will 
provide evidenc e as to whether patients treated on a single arm phase II trial of targeted therapy 
derive additio nal clinical benefit and the comparison can be used to provide more robust data for 
confirmatory phase III clinical trial design.  Likewise, patients whose tum ors do not have 
mesenchymal features can be enrolled on this protocol and receive DAE, which will allow a

1.1 Introduction to investigational treatments and other study treatments  
Everolimus is a novel derivative of rapamycin. It has been in clinical development since 1996 as 
an immunosuppressant in solid organ transplantation. Everolimus is approved i n Europe and 
other global markets (trade name: Certican®) for cardiac and renal transplantation, a nd in the 
United States (trade name: Zortress®) for the prevention of organ rejection of kidney 
transplantation.  
 
Afinitor ® and was approved for adults with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) after failure of 
treatment with sunitinib or sorafinib in 2009.  In 2010, Afinitor® received United States (US) 
approval for patients with subependymal giant cell astrocytoma (SEGA) asso ciated with tuberous 
sclerosis complex (TSC). Everolimus is also available as Votubia® in the European Union (EU) 
for patients with SE GA associated with TSC who require therapeutic intervention but are not 
candidates for curative surgical resection. Afinit or® was approved for “progressive pancreatic 
neuroendocrine tumor (PNET) in patients with unresectable, locally advanced, or metastati c 
disease” in 2011 in various countries, including the US and Europe. In 2012 Afinitor® received 
approval for the treatmen t of postmenopausal women with advanced hormone receptor -positive, 
HER2 - negative breast cancer (advanced HR+ BC) in combination with exemestane, after failure 
of treatment with letrozole or anastrozole. Furthermore in 2012, Afinitor® received approval for  
the treatment of patients with TSC who have renal angiomyolipoma not requiring immediate 
surgery.  
 
Approximately 35,982  cancer patien ts have been treated with everolimus as of  3 1-Mar-2014: 
• 19,668  patients in Novartis -sponsored clinical trials  
• 2,394  patie nts in the individual patient supply program  
• More than 13,930 patients in investigator -sponsored studies.  
• In addition, healthy volunte er subjects and non -oncology hepatically impaired subjects have  
participated in the clinical pharmacology  studies as des cribed in Section 7.2.  
The following is a brief summary of the main characteristics of Everolimus. More complete 
information can be ob tained from the Everolimus Investigator’s Brochure (IB).   
1.2 Overview of Everolimus  
Everolimus is a derivative of rapamyc in which acts as a signal transduction inhibitor ( Table 1 and 
Figure 5) . Everolimus selectively inhibits mTOR (mammalian target of rap amycin), specifically 
targeting the mTOR -raptor signal transduction complex. mTOR is a key serine -threonine kinase 
in the PI3K/AKT signaling cascade, which is known to be dysregulated in a wide spectrum of 
human cancers (Boulay and Lane 2007).  
Everolimus i s being investigated as an anticancer agent based on its potential to act  
• directly on the tumor cells by inhibiting tumor cell growth and proliferation;  
• indirectly by inhibiting angiogenesis leading to reduced tumor vascularity (via potent inhibition 
of tu mor cell VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) production and VEGF -induced 
proliferation of endothelial cells).

1.2.2 mTOR pathway and cancer  
At the cellular and molecular level, Everolimus acts as a signal transduction inhibitor. It selectively 
inhibits mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin), a key protein kinase w hich regulates cell 
growth, proliferation and survival. The mTOR kinase is mainly a ctivated via the 
phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase (PI3 -Kinase) pathway through AKT/PKB and the tuberous sclerosis 
complex (TSC1/2). Mutations in these components or in PTEN, a negative regulator of PI3 -
kinase, may result in their dysregulation. Abnormal funct ioning of various components of the 
signaling pathways contributes to the pathophysiology of numerous human cancers. Various 
preclinical models have confirmed the role of th is pathway in t umor development .[14] 
 
The main known functions of mTOR include the following  [15]: 
• mTOR functions as a sensor of mitogens, growth factors and energy and nutrient levels;  
• Facilitating cell-cycle pr ogression from G1 -S phase in appropriate growth conditions;  
• The PI3K/mTOR pathway itself is frequently dysregulated in many human cancers, and 
oncogenic transformation may sensitize tumor cells to mTOR inhibitors;  
• PI3-kinase mutations have bee n reported in  the primary tumor in 10 -20% of human colorectal 
cancers  [16, 17]; 
• The loss of PTEN protein, either through gene deletion or functional silencing (promoter 
hypermethylation), is reported in approximately 60% of primary human colorectal cancers  
[18]; 
• The mTOR pathway  is involved in the production of pro -angiogenic factors (i.e., VEGF) and 
inhibition of endothelial cell growth and proliferation;  
• Through inactivating eukaryotic initiation factor 4E binding proteins and activating the 40S 
ribosomal S6 kinases (i.e., p70S 6K1), mTOR regulates protein translation, including the HIF -
1 proteins. Inh ibition of mTOR is expected to lead to decreased expression of HIF -1. 
 
1.2.3  Non-clinical experience  
Everolimus inhibits the proliferation of a range of human tumor cell lines in vitro including lines 
originating from lung, breast, prostate, colon, melanoma and glioblastoma. IC50s range from 
sub/low nM to µM. Everolimus also inhibits the proliferation of human umbilical vein endothelial 
cells (HUVECS) in vitro , with particular potenc y against VEGF -induced proliferation suggesting 
that Everolimus may also act as an anti -angiogenic agent. The anti -angiogenic activity of 
Everolimus was confirmed in vivo . Everolimus selectively inhibited VEGF -dependent angiogenic

 Version 11; February 1 , 2021  
13 
 response at well tolerate d doses. Mice with primary and metastatic tumors treated with 
Everolimus showed a significant reduction in blood vessel density when compared to controls.  
The potential of Everolimus as an anti -cancer agent was shown in rodent models. Everolimus is 
orally bioavailable, residing longer in tumor tissue than in plasma in a subcutaneous mouse 
xenograft model, and demonstrating high tumor penetration in a rat pancreatic tumor model. The 
pharmacokinetic profile of Everolimus indicates sufficient tumor penetration , above that needed to 
inhibit the proliferation of endothelial cells and tumor cell lines deemed sensitive to Everolimus in 
vitro. 
 
Everolimus administered orally daily was a potent inhibitor of tumor growth, at well tolerated 
doses, in 11 different mouse  xenograft models (including pancreatic, colon, epidermoid, lung and 
melanoma) and two syngeneic models (rat pancreatic, mouse orthotopic melanoma). These 
models included tumor lines considered sensitive and “relatively resistant” in vitro . In general, 
Everolimus was better tolerated in mouse xenograft models than standard cytotoxic agents (i.e., 
doxorubicin and 5 -fluorouracil), while possessing similar anti -tumor activity. Additionally, activity in 
a VEGF -impregnated subcutaneous implant model of angiogene sis and reduced vascularity 
(vessel density) of Everolimus -treated tumors (murine melanoma) provided evidence of in vivo  
effects of angiogenesis.  
 
It is not clear which molecular determinants predict responsiveness of tumor cells to Everolimus. 
Molecular a nalysis has revealed that relative sensitivity to Everolimus in vitro  correlates with the 
degree of phosphorylation (activation) of the AKT/PKB pro tein kinase and the S6 ribosomal 
protein; in some cases (i.e., glioblastoma) there is also a correlation with  PTEN status.  
In vivo  studies investigating the anti -tumor activity of Everolimus in experimental animal tumor 
models showed that Everolimus monoth erapy typically reduced tumor cell growth rates rather 
than produced regressions. These effects occurred with in the dose range of 2.5 mg to 10 mg/kg, 
orally once a day.  
 
In preclinical models, the administration of Everolimus is associated with reduction o f protein 
phosphorylation in target proteins downstream of mTOR, notably phosphorylated S6 (p -S6) and 
p-4E-BP1, and occasionally with an increase in phosphorylated AKT, a protein upstream of 
mTOR signaling pathway.  
 
All significant adverse events observed in toxicology studies with Everolimus in mice, rats, 
monkeys and mini -pigs were consistent with its anticipat ed pharmacological action as an anti -
proliferative and immunosuppressant and at least in part reversible after a 2 or 4 -week recovery 
period with t he exception of the changes in male reproductive organs, most notably testes.  
In vitro genotoxicity studies c overing relevant genotoxicity end -points showed no evidence of  
clastogenic or mutagenic activity.  
 
In male fertility studies in rats, testicular mo rphology was affected at 0.5 mg/kg and above, and 
sperm motility, sperm head count and plasma testosterone le vels were diminished at 5 mg/kg 
which corresponded to 0.7 times the estimated clinical exposure at 10 mg/day, and caused a 
decrease in male fertili ty. There was evidence of reversibility. Female fertility was not affected, 
but everolimus caused an increase  of pre -implantation loss in female rats at doses > 0.1 mg/kg, 
suggesting it could also potentially impact fertility in females.  Everolimus crosse d the placenta 
and was toxic to the conceptus. In rats, everolimus caused embryo/fetotoxicity at systemic 
exposure below the planned therapeutic level comprising mortality and reduced fetal weight. The 
incidence of skeletal variations and malformations at 0.3 and 0.9 mg/kg (e.g. sternal cleft) was 
increased. In rabbits, embryo toxicity was evident by an increase in late resorptions. Effects of 
everolimus on the pre - and postnatal development of rats were limited to slightly affected body 
weight and survival  in the F1 -generation at ≥0.1 mg/kg, and did not indicate a specific toxic 
potential.  
 
The potential reproductive risk for humans is unknown. However, due to the observed 
malformations in rats, everolimus should be considered potentially teratogenic. Ever olimus should 
 MDACC# 2015 -0087  
 Version 11; February 1 , 2021  
14 
 not be given to pregnant women unless the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk for the 
fetus. Women of childbearing potential should be advised to use highly effective contraception 
methods while they are receiving everolimus and up  to 8 weeks after treatment has been 
stopped. It is not known whether everolimus is excreted in human milk. In animal studies, 
everolimus and/or its metabolites were readily transferred into the milk of lactating rats. Therefore 
women who are taking everol imus should not breastfeed.  
 
Further details can be found in the Ever olimus Investigator’s Brochure.  
 
1.3 Rationale for DAE  in claudin -low/mesenchymal/mesenchymal stem cell -like TNBC  
Though most TNBCs are classified as basal -like by gene expression array analysis, 
approximately 30% of triple -negative tumors are molecularly distinct from basal -like breast 
cancers as they display mesenchymal fe atures, including enrichment in epithelial -to-
mesenchymal transition (EMT) and stem -cell like characteristics. [1, 11, 19]  TNBCs  and TNBC 
cell lines  with mesenchymal features have been identified by multiple independent investigators 
and have been labeled ‘claudin -low’, ‘mesenchymal’ and ‘mesenchymal s tem cell -like’.[1, 11] 
Emerging data suggest that, in contrast to basal subtypes of TNBC, these mesenchymal  TNBCs 
carry a high rate of molecular aberrat ions that activate the PI3K/Akt/mTOR axis sugges ting that 
this subgroup may be responsive to therapeutic regimens targeting this pathway. [1, 6]  Cell lines 
charact erized as mesen chymal/mesenchymal stem -like were noted to have  a high rate of 
molecular aberrations that could result in activation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway and 
demonstrated response to PI3K -pathway  inhibitors in both cell culture assays and xenograft 
models .[1]  
Many of these cell lines have also been classified as claudin -low. These features were not shared 
by the basal -like cell lines (BL1 and BL2), which were noted to have high proliferative rates, 
absence of mutations in PIK3CA, enhanced response to cisplatin and diminished sensitivity to the 
dual mTOR/ PI3kina se inhibitor NVP -BEZ235. [1]  
Though evaluation using H&E staining/light microscopy cannot detect distinct morphological 
features that would distinguish most mesenchymal -like TNBCs from non -mesenchymal TNBCs, 
approximately 10 -30% of tumors molecularly characterized as  ‘claudin -low’ can be 
morphologically identified as metaplastic breast cancers using these conventional techniques. [6, 
11] Metaplastic breast c ancers are commonly triple negative, considered refractory to standard 
therapy, and harbor a high rate of molecular aberrations that lead to activation of the PI3K - 
pathway. [6] Although genomic profiling, using unsupervised hierarchical clustering of patient 
samples, initially grouped metaplastic tumors within the spectrum of basal -like invasive ductal 
carcinomas (IDCs) some transcripts wer e found to be differentially expressed between 
metaplastic cancers and basal -like IDCs. [20] For example, DNA repair pathways such as BRCA1, 
PTEN and TOP2A were sig nificantly down regulated in the metapla stic tumors compared to the 
basal -like IDCs. [20] Further genomic analyses by Hennessy et al. revealed that metaplastic 
tumo rs with mesenchymal features, such as sarcomatoid met aplasia, more closely resembled the 
claudin -low subtype of breast cancers rather  
than basal -like IDCs. [6] Like the mesenchymal/mesenchymal stem -like cell lines, metaplastic 
tumors with mesenchymal features have been associated with a high rate of mutations in PIK3CA  
(47%) and occasional mutations in PTEN  (5%), which was noted to be much higher than the 8%  
(all PIK3 CA) seen with non -metaplastic, TNBC. [6] Reverse -phase protein array (RPPA) 
confirmed elevations in the phosphorylation of phosphatidy linositol 3 -kinase/Akt pathway proteins 
in metaplastic tumors (also noted to be higher than non -metaplastic TNBC tumors) further 
supporting the genomic profiling analyses and suggesting that agents which target the 
PI3K/mTOR pathway may be a via ble option for the treatment of metaplasti c breast cancer. [6] 
Metaplastic breast cancers have also been found to express high levels of vascular endothelial 
growth factor (VEGF) and hypoxia -induced factor ( HIF-1), a transcription factor important for 
vasculogenesis  and that signals through the mTOR pathway .[21, 22] There fore, it is likely that 

 MDACC# 2015 -0087  
 Version 11; February 1 , 2021  
15 
 metaplastic tumors act as a morphologically identified ‘surrogate of response’ to evaluate the 
activity of targeted therapy regimens in mesenchymal -like TNBC.   
 
Based upon the molecular features of metaplastic breast cancer, 52 patients with metastatic, 
metaplastic breast cancer have been treated using a regimen using a combination of pegylated 
liposomal doxorubicin, bevacizumab and the mTOR inhibitor s, temsirolimus (DAT)  or everolimus 
(DAE).  Most patients were treated on the Ph ase I trial that established the maximum tolerated 
dose (MTD) for this regimen. [23] The objective response rate (ORR) was 21% [complete 
response (CR)=4 (8%); parti al response (PR)=7 (13%)] and 10 (19%) pts had stable disease 
(SD)≥6 months for a clinical benefit rate (CBR) of 40%.  One patient had a CR that remains 
durable for greater than  5 years on maintenance everolimus. Tissue was available for testing in 
43 pts and 32 (74%) had a PI3K -pathway activating aberration. PI3K -pathway activation was 
associated with a significant improvement in ORR (31 vs 0%; P=0.043). It is notable that 12 
patients with metastatic non-metaplastic TNBC were also treated with DAT, and onl y 1 patient 
had a response (CR/PR=1; SD≥6 months=0 ).[24]  
 
In this cohort, 13 patients were treated with DAE, with 9 patients being treated with liposomal 
doxorubi cin 30mg/m2 IV Q3W, bevacizumab 15mg/kg IV Q3W and everolimus 7.5mg PO every 
day for 21 days. In these 9 patients, grade 3 -4 toxicities included  neutropenia  (N=2; 22%), 
anemia (N=2; 22 %), fatigue (N=2; 22%), thrombocytopenia (N=1; 11%), mucositis (N=1; 11% ) 
and transa minitis (N=1; 11%). G rade 2 pulmonary toxicity was seen in one patient who was 
treated with DAE.  Despite previous anthracycline exposure in approximately 85% of patients, no 
patients treated with DAE developed grade 3 -4 heart failure. Although some patient s required 
dose reduction and treatment interruptions d ue to toxicity, no  patients discontinued treatment due 
to toxicity.  
 
1.4 Rationale for Everolimus  
 
Mesenchymal and mesenchymal stem cell -like tumors a re hypothesized to develop from 
immatur e breast precursor cells, thus retaining cancer stem cell (CSC) -like features. Metaplastic 
and claudin -low cancers also closely resemble cancer stem cells (CSCs)  and, given the role of 
the Akt pathway in stem cell maintenance, may be one reason metaplastic  tumors are sensitive to 
mTOR inhibition.  In preclinical studies, activation of PI3K/mTOR has been associated with CSC 
tumorigenicity, survival and capacity for self -renewal .[25, 26] Activation of this pathway is known 
to play an important role in breast cancer resistance to chemotherapy, HER2 targeted therapy 
and endocrine therapy as demonstrated in pre -clinical mode ls [27-29] and confirmed in clinical 
trials  [30-32]. The PI3K/mTOR pat hway is involved in regulation of the signal transduction and 
activator of transcription (STAT3) pathway, which has been implicated in CSC survi val.[26] 
Additionally,  survival signal ing by Notch1, a transmembrane protein involved in embryonic 
development and highly expressed in CSCs, is medi ated through mTOR .[33] Inhibition o f mTOR 
with rapamycin decreased breast CSC fractions in cell culture and impaired breast CSC 
tumorigenicity in mouse models .[26] Further, in pre -clinical studies, xen ograft models of 
mesen chymal cells lines carrying PIK3CA mutations displayed partial or complete response with 
the mTOR/PI3kinase inhibitor NVP -BEZ235.[1]  
1.5 Rationale for Bevacizumab  
 
CSCs show high adaptability to inhospitable microenvironments or ‘tumo r niches’. CSCs are able 
to survive in hypoxic conditions, presumably through the use of anaerobic glycolysis for 
generation of ATP, a process that involves activation of the PI3K pathway .[34-38]  Additionally, 
hypoxia has been implicated in CSC self -renewal, with increasing oxygen levels resulting in 
proliferation, maturation and exhaustion of the CSC pool [39]. Under hypoxic  conditions, act ivated 
Akt promotes accumulation of hypoxia -induced factor (HIF -1), a transcription factor important for 
vasculogenesis, which is upregulated in stem cell promoti ng cell culture of breast cancer cell lines 
(Woodward, data not shown) .[40, 41] CSCs also produce much higher levels of vascular 
endothelial growth factor (VEGF) than non -CSC tumor cells and treatment with bev acizumab 

 MDACC# 2015 -0087  
 Version 11; February 1 , 2021  
16 
 inhibited gr owth in tumors derived from CSC -positive  cells but had no effect upon tumors derived 
from non -CSC cells in xenograft models [42].  More importantly , early evidence is emerging that 
suggests that CSCs may be dependent  upon growth factors secreted by tumor vasculature .[43] 
Though most of the data concerning t he CSC/vascular niche arises from brain tumors, data exist 
supporting the effects of the extracellular matrix in maintaining a breast CSCs phenotype, as well 
as, hypoxic conditions supporting self -renewal [44]. Interestingly, new data have emerged 
suggesting that treatment with bevacizumab induces intratumoral hypoxia which increases the 
populati on of CSCs in breast cancer xenografts. [45]  This increase in CSC population was 
associated with increased phosphorylation of Akt suggesting that treatment with bevacizumab 
may actually prime tumors with CSC like characteristics for response to temsir olimus. 
Additionally, under hypoxic conditions, activated Akt also promotes accumulation of hypoxia -
induced factor (HIF -1) a transcription factor important for vasculogenesis, which is up -regulated in 
stem cell promoting cell culture of breast cancer cell lines. As such, the combination of 
bevacizumab w ith temsirolimus could impact vasculogenesis by affecting both HIF -1 and VEGF 
production leading to increased tumor hypoxia.   
1.6 Rationale for Liposomal Doxorubicin  
 
The success of doxorubicin in the treatm ent of sarcoma suggests that other tumors with 
mesenchymal features may also be responsive to anthracyclines. [46] As confirmation, 
doxorubicin has shown response in sarcomatoid renal cell carcin oma. [47] Activation of the 
PI3K/mTOR  pathway is known to play an important role in breast cancer resistance to 
chemothera py, and it is possible that  mTOR inhibition may  be able to overcome resistance to 
anthr acyclines . In a study of metastatic metaplastic TNBC patients conducted at MDACC , 23 
patients were treated with temsirolimus containing regimens. In patients treated wit h DAT or DT, 
the response rate was about 30%. [48] However, in the patients treated with  paclitaxel or 
carbopla tin in combination with temsirolimus , the response rate was 0%. Additionally, one patien t 
was treated with temsirolimus alone, and no response was seen. This data suggests synergistic 
activity of mTOR inhibition with ant hracycline therapy but not paclitaxe l or carboplatin therapy in 
this subset of patients . In another study conducted at MDACC , patients with early stage TNBC 
treated with everolimus in combination with paclitaxel followed by anthracycline containing 
therapy in the neoadjuvant setting  had no i ncrease  in pCR rates compared to patients treated 
with paclitaxel  alone  followed by anth racycline  containing therapy .[49] As further proof of 
principle, doxorubicin but not paclitaxel was able to inhibit growth in PTEN knockout mammary 
cell lin es, suggesting that anthracycline therapy may be more effective in cell lines exhi biting PI3K 
pathway activation. [50]  
 
2.0 Study Rationale / Purpose  
Based upon the above  mentioned  data, it is hypothesized that chemo -insensitive TNBCs with 
mesenchymal features will have higher rates of RCB -0 to RCB -1 with neoad juvant DAE  than 
historically seen with paclitaxel alone.  
 
2.1 Feasibility  
At MDACC, approximately 600 newly diagnosed TNBC patients are seen per year, and the 
majority will be eligible for screening for the triaging protocol. Of those, approximately 50% wi ll be 
predicted chemo -insensitive based on molecular analysis performed on  the pre -treatment biopsy 
and confirmed chemo -insensitive based on diagnostic imaging performed after four cycles of 
anthracycline -based therapy. As such, we  estimate th at there will  be approximately 3 00 patients 
within the molecular triaging protocol who will be eligible for experimental therapies yearly. Of 
these, approximatel y 30% (90 patients yearly) are expected to have mesenchymal TNBCs. It is 
estimated that most of these patien ts will have evidence of some vimentin staining (~80%), which 
will identif y these patients for enrollment in this trial. Additionally, some patients who will not have 
the results of their molecular profiling will also be recruited to this trial. Our study design requires 
37 patients to determine if there is sufficient efficacy d ata to move to a phase III registration trial. 
Assuming a 50% accrual rate , we anticipate completing accrual within 15 months with all patients 
undergoing surgery with assessment for  pathologic complete response within 18 months.

2.2 Rationale for Correla tive Studies  
Unfortunately, neither of the gene expression profiles  used to identify claudin -low or 
mesenchymal/  mesenchymal stem cell -like TNBCs have  been CLIA certified or are currently 
available as an assay that can be performed in formalin -fixed, paraffin -embedded (FFPE) tissue 
samples; however, staining for vimentin using immunohistochemistry  (IHC)  is a CLIA certified test 
that is routinely performed using FFPE tissue.   
 
Vimentin staining has been routinely 
used to identify cells of mesenchymal 
origin and has been used to 
characterize breast tumors or cell lines 
undergoing EM T. This assay is 
commercially available, available in or 
CLIA laboratory  and vimentin is 
commonl y expressed in non -tumor 
stroma, which can be used as a 
positive control when measuring for 
expression within cancer cells.  
Vimentin expression within breast 
cancer cells has been associated with 
a more aggressive triple -negative 
phenotype in retrospectiv e 
analyses. [53, 54]  Claudin -low tumors 
are commonly vimentin -positive. [11] 
Though the Pietenpol  group did not 
use vimentin staining to characterize  
the mesenchymal and mesenchymal  
stem-like cell lines, most of t he lines 
identified by these signatures have 
been previously characterized as 
vimentin -positive  (Table 2 ) and cell 
lines which have been characterized 
as mesenchymal or mesenchymal -
stem cell -like have demonstrated high 
levels of  vimentin expression 
compared to  basal -like cell lines 
(Figure 6 , Ueno unpublished data). 
Interestingly, metaplastic tumors are 
almost always vime ntin-positive  (Table 
3).[55]  
Reproducibility and Potential Clinical 
Relevance of Vimentin Staining : 
To address concerns of reproducibility, 
tissue M icroarrays (TMAs) of non-
metaplastic TNBCs (n=64 tumors) were 
stained x 3 sets of slides and scored for 
the presence or absence of vimentin in 
the epithelial carcinoma cells by two  
MDACC pathologists. Inter -pathologist  
reliability was assessed using standa rd 
metrics as defined  in Table 4 .  The first 
4 of these metrics are considered Table 2: Comparison of Vimentin Staining in Cell Lines

 measures of association and the kappa statistic is a measure of agreement.  A generalized 
linear intercept only model was also fitted to the response data which contained a rand om 
subject effect ass uming the subject effect had an exchangeable variance -covariance structure 
(which is the same as a compound symmetry). In this model, there were two observations 
(pathologist one and pathologist 2) for each unique slide (considered the  subject for the 
mode l). This linear model was used to estimate the working correlation between paired 
responses and also to estimate the intra -class correlation.  All analyses suggested the inter -
pathologist reliability to be above 90%.  
 
To determine the  intra-pathologist reliability as a surrogate for staining reproducibility, a 
generalized linear intercept only model was fitted to the response data which contained a random 
subject effect  assuming the subject effect had an  exchangeable variance -covarianc e structure.   
 
A model for each pathologist was fitted separately in 
which each subject was each specimen and thus 
there were three observations for each  specimen 
(TN33, TN34, & TN35).   As such, each specimen 
represented a cluster or class. The linear model was 
used to estimate  the working correlation within 
cluster and also to estimate the intra -class 
correlation.  An aggregate model was also fitted 
where each cluster was specimen within 
pathologists.  The estimates are presented in Table 
5. All analyses suggested a strong corr elation further 
supporting the  reproducibility of this assay  
 
 
Finally, as proof of princip le, vimentin staining was 
performed on archived tissue samples from a subset 
of patients (n=4) with available tissue who carried a 
diagnosis of metastatic non-metaplasti c TNBC and 
were treated with DA T. Eight additional patients had 
no archived tissue but were evaluated for response 
to therapy. Of the 12 unselected non -metaplastic 
TNBC, all but 1 patient exhibited PD as best response for a RR of 8%; however, of the 4 who 
had archived tissue available, only the tumor from the patient who developed a partial 
response had any evidence of vimentin staining.

 All patients will undergo surgical resection of their primary tumor  unless they are deemed not fit 
for surgery after 4 cycles of therapy . Patients may undergo either lymph no de sampling  or 
complete axillary dissection  as considered standard of care by their surgeon. In order to decrease 
wound complications from bevacizuma b, patients will be recommended  to wait 6 weeks after the 
last dose of bevacizumab before undergoing surgic al resection.   
 
 
 
 
5.2 Schedule of Dosing:  
5.2.0 All dosages prescribed and dispensed to the patient and all dose changes during the study        
must be  recorded.  
5.2.1  Medication labels will comply with US legal requirements and be printed in English. They 
will su pply no information about the patient. The storage conditions for Everolimus will be 
described on the medication label.  
5.2.2  Everolimus is supplied by Nov artis. Everolimus is formulated as tablets for oral 
administration of 2.5mg, 5mg, and 10mg strength. Tablet s are blister -packed under 
aluminum foil, which should be opened only at the time of administration as drug is both 
hygroscopic and light -sensitive.  Refer to label for expiration date and storage conditions.  
5.2.3  The extent of absorption of everolimus through t opical exposure is not known.  Therefore, 
caregivers are advised to avoid contact with suspensions of Afinitor Tablets.  Wash 
hands thoroughly before  and after preparation of either suspension.  
5.2.4  The investigator should promote compliance by instructing the patient to take the study 
drug exactly as prescribed and by stating that compliance is necessary for the patient’s 
safety and the validity of the stu dy. The patient should be instructed to contact the 
investigator if he/she is unable for any reason to take  the study drug as prescribed.  
5.2.5  Everolimus should be administered orally once daily at the same time every day, either 
consistently with or consistent ly without food.   
5.2.6  The tablets should be swallowed whole with a glass of water and should not be chewed 
or crushed. For patients unable to swallow tablets, the tablet(s) should be dispersed 
completely in a glass of water (containing approximately 30 mL) by  gently stirring until the 
tablet(s) is fully disintegrated (approximately 7 minutes), immediately prior to  drinking. 
The glass should be rinsed with the same volume of water and the rinse completely 
swallowed to ensure the entire dose is administered.  
5.2.7  If vomiting occurs, no attempt should be made to replace the vomited dose. Patients 
should be instructed that  if they miss a dose on one day, they must not take any extra 
dose the next day, but instead to immediately contact the study center as soon as 
possi ble to ask for advice.  
5.3 Everolimus Dosing in Special Populations  
 MDACC# 2015 -0087  
 Version 11; February 1 , 2021  
26 
 • Geriatrics (≥ 65 years):  No dosage adjustment is required.  
• Renal impairment : No dosage adjustment is required.  
• Ethnicity:  Pharmacokinetic characteristics are similar for Caucasian and Japanese 
subjects.  
Pharmacokinetic studies in Black transplant patients have shown an average 20% higher 
clearance; however doses above 7.5 mg daily will not be administered as individual PK levels will 
not be evaluated on this trial.  
 
5.4 Drug Information  including Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs)  
 
5.4.1  Liposomal doxorubicin (D oxil®)  
Liposomal doxorubicin  is pegylated liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride (HCL). Doxorubicin is an 
anthracycline topoisomerase inhibitor that acts during the S1 phase  of the cell cycle by 
intercalating irreversibly between DNA base pairs to form a comp lex that inhibits the progression 
of the enzyme topoisomerase II. Topoisomerase II functions to unwind the DNA double helix in 
preparation for transcription. Doxorubicin stabilizes the topoisomerase II complex after it has 
broken the DNA chain for replicat ion, preventing the DNA double helix from being resealed and 
thereby stopping the process of replication. This leads to inhibition of mitotic activity and nucleic 
acid sy nthesis, induction of mutagenesis and tumor cell death [56]. Liposomal doxor ubicin  is 
doxorubicin HCL encapsulated in STEALTH® liposomes. Lipo somes are microscopic vesicles 
composed of a phospholipid bilayer that are capable of encapsulating active drugs. The 
STEALTH® liposomes of liposomal doxorubicin  are formulated with surface -bound 
methoxypolyethylene glycol (MPEG), a process referred to as pegylation, to protect liposomes 
from detection by the mononuclear phagocyte system (MPS) and to increase blood circulation 
time[57]. Liposomal doxorubicin  has a half -life of approximately 55 hours in humans. They are 
stable in blood, and at least 90% of the drug remains liposome encapsula ted during circulation. It 
is believed that because of their small size (~100nm) and persistence in the circulation, the 
pegylated liposomal doxorubicin  liposomes are able to penetrate the altered and often 
compromised vasculature of tumors. After distribu tion to the tissue compartment, the 
encapsulated doxorubicin HCL becomes available [57]. Metabolism of liposomal doxorubicin  is 
extensively metabolized in t he liver and eliminated primarily as glucuronide or hydroxylated 
conjugates [56].  
The most common adverse reactions observed with liposomal doxorubicin  are asthenia, fatigue, 
fever, nausea, stomatitis, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, anorexia, hand -foot syndrome, rash 
and neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia [57]. The most clinically important adverse 
effects are discussed below:  
Myelosuppression  
Myelosuppression is the dose -limiting toxicity of liposomal doxorubicin . S igns of 
myelosuppression include pancytopenia, leukopenia, neutropenia, anemia, and 
thrombocytopenia. In ovarian cancer patients, leukopenia occurred in 42% of patients, 
neutropenia ( ANC < 1000 cells/mm3) in 19 —35%, anemia in 40.2%, and thrombocytopenia in  
24%. Severe neutropenia (ANC < 500 cells/mm3) occurred in 8% and severe thrombocytopenia 
(< 25,000 cells/mm3) occurred in 1%. Severe infection (1 —5%) and sepsis have been seen in 
patients with doxorubicin -induced myelosuppression [56]. 
Cardiac Toxicity   
Special attention must be given to the risk of myocardial  damage from cumulative doses of 
doxorubicin HCL. In particular, left ventricular failure may occur in patients who receive a 
cumulative dosage of d oxorubicin exceeding the current recommended limit of 550mg/m2. Lower 
doses can cause heart failure in patie nts who have received radiotherapy to the mediastinal area 

 MDACC# 2015 -0087  
 Version 11; February 1 , 2021  
27 
 or concomitant therapy with other potentially cardiotoxic agents such as cyclophosphamide . Prior 
use of ot her anthracyclines or anthracene diones should be included in calculations of total 
cumulati ve dosage. Cardiac function in patients suspected to have myocardial injury related to 
liposomal doxorubicin  should be considered for multi -gated ra dionuclide scans or 
echocardiography [56]. 
Infusion reactions  
An infusion -associated reaction has been identified with liposomal doxorubicin . This reaction is 
due t o the liposomes themselves or one of the surface components Patients who experience this 
reaction generally do so with the first liposomal doxorubicin  dose and not with subsequent dosing. 
Liposomal doxorubicin  should be administered  at an initial rate of 1  mg/min to decrease the 
incidence of this reaction; if no symptoms occur, the infusion rate may be increased to complete 
the infusion within 1 hour. Symptoms include fever (9.1 —21.3%), flushing, dyspnea, facial 
swelling, headache (5 %), chills 1 —5%), back p ain (1 —5%), tightness in the chest and throat, 
rash (unspecified) (22%), pruritus (1 —5%), chest pain (unspecified) (1 —5%), hypotension, 
syncope, sinus tachycardia, apnea, bronchospasm/wheezing, dyspnea(1 —5%), cyanosis, and/or 
asthma . Serious and sometimes life-threatening or fatal anaphylactic shock/anaphylactoid 
reactions have been reported (1 —5%)[56].  
Palmar -plantar erythrodysesthesia (PPE) / Hand -Foot syndrome (HFS)  
Hand and foot syndrome developed in 50.6% of patients treated for ovarian cancer dosed at 50 
mg/m2; 23.8% of these patients developed a severe reaction (i.e., Grade 3 —4). The increased 
incidence in ovarian cancer patients is due to the higher doses used; liposomal doxorubicin ® 
given at doses of > 20 mg/m2 or at shorter intervals  than recommended are associated with an 
increased incidence. Among 3 18 patients with multiple myeloma who received liposomal 
doxorubicin at 30 mg/m2 every 3 weeks plus bortezomib, 19% had PPE; in contrast, < 1% of 318 
patients who received bortezomib mono therapy had the event. This syndrome usually occurs 
after the second or third cycle and is associated with the cumulative liposomal doxorubicin 
dose [56].  
Nausea/Vomiting /Diarrhea  
Nausea/vomiting occurs in 18 -46% and 8 -33% of patients treated with liposomal doxorubicin , 
respec tively, and increases with increasing dose. Liposomal doxorubicin  is not as emetogenic as 
conventional doxorubicin but premedication with antiemetics is still necessary. Stomatitis and 
mucositis occur more frequently with liposomal doxorubicin  due to the longer half -life than 
conventional doxorubicin. In patients treate d with higher doses, the incidence of stomatitis is 
increased (37%) and 7% of patients develop severe reactions. Diarrhea has been reported in 
20.9% and constipation in 30.1% of patients treated with liposomal doxorubicin [56].  
 
 
 
5.4.2  Bevacizumab (Avastin®)  
Bevacizumab is a recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody , specifically an IgG1 antibody  
that contains human framework regions and murine complementarity -determining regions. 
Bevacizumab binds to human vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and prevents interaction 
of VEGF with its receptors (Flt -1, KDR) on the surface of endothelial cells . In vitro models of 
angiogenesis have shown that interaction of VEGF with its receptors may lead to endothelial cell 
proliferation and new blood vessel formation. Evidence from anima l models has suggested that 
administration of an anti -VEGF monoclonal ant ibody (e.g., bevacizumab) may inhibit 
angiogenesis and thus may reduce microvascular growth of tumors and inhibit metastatic disease 
progression. Bevacizumab is metabolized and elimin ated via the reticuloendothelial system [58]. 
The estimated half -life of the dr ug is approximately 20 days. Clearance of the drug is dependent 
upon gender and tumor burden, with males an d patients with a higher tumor burden clearing 

 MDACC# 2015 -0087  
 Version 11; February 1 , 2021  
28 
 bevacizumab faster. In clinical trials, there has been no evidence of lesser efficacy in males or 
patients with a higher tumor burden as compared to females or patients with a lower tumor 
burden [59].  Adverse reaction data for bevaci zumab are reported from clinical trial results. 
Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditi ons, adverse reaction rates 
observed in the clinical trial of one drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials 
of other dr ugs and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice [59].  
Thromboembolism  
Bevacizumab therapy is associated with an increased risk of arterial and venous 
thromboembolism in metastatic colon cancer and non -small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. 
Additionally, in meta static colon cancer patients , there is an increased risk of developing a 
second subsequent thromboembolic event in patients receiving bevacizumab plus chemotherapy 
versus chemotherapy alone. Among 53 patients who got bevacizumab and chemotherapy for 
metast atic colon cancer and receiv ed warfarin for a venous thromboembolic event, 11 had an 
additional thromboembolic event. In contrast, 1 of the 30 patients who got chemotherapy alone 
and received warfarin for a venous thromboembolic event had an additional thr omboembolic 
event. A pooled analysis of randomized controlled clinical trials demonstrated an arterial 
thromboembolism rate of 4.4% in 963 patients treated with bevacizumab in combination with 
chemotherapy. Of these events, fatal outcomes occurred in 7 of 963 (0.7%) patients. Arteria l 
thrombotic events have included cerebral infarction (stroke), transient ischemic attack (TIA), 
myocardial infarction, angina, and a variety of other arterial thromboembolic events. The 
incidences of both cerebrovascular arteri al events and cardiovascular  arterial events were 
increased in patients receiving bevacizumab (1.9% and 2.1%, respectively) as compared with 
chemotherapy alone (0.5% and 1%, respectively). In addition, there was a correlation between 
age (>= 65 years vs. <  65 years) and the increase in risk of thromboembolic events (8.5% vs. 
2.1%, respectively). In the clinical trial of patients with NSCLC, the incidence of venous 
thrombosis/embolism was 5% among patients who got bevacizumab and chemotherapy and 3% 
among ch emotherapy alone recipients.  An increased risk for a venous thromboembolic event was 
not found by a post -hoc analysis of data from 5 trials. Other thrombotic events reported during 
bevacizumab therapy have included axillary/subclavian vein occlusion, super ior mesenteric 
thrombosis, p hlebitis (thrombophlebitis), catheter thrombosis, and venous sclerosis. Bevacizumab 
should be permanently discontinued in patients who experience a severe arterial thromboembolic 
event [59]. 
Gastrointestinal (GI) Perforations and Wound Healing Co mplicat ions 
GI perforation complicated by intra -abdominal abscesses or fistula formation occurred more 
frequently in patients receiving bevacizumab as compared to controls during clinical trials (range 
4-11%). In colorectal clinical trials, including singl e-agent  bevacizumab and bevacizumab in 
combination with other chemotherapy agents, the incidence of GI perforation, fistula formation, 
and/or intra -abdominal abscess was 2.4%; in non -small cell cancer clinical trials the incidence 
was 0.9%. GI perforation,  fistula (gastrointestinal fistula, enterocutaneous fistula, esophageal 
fistula, duodenal fistula, rectal fistula), and/or intra -abdominal abscess have also been reported 
during post -market reports and trials for colorectal cancer and other types of cancer . Of th e 
reported events, 30% were fatal. GI perforation has occurred at various time points during 
bevacizumab therapy; most events occur within the first 50 days. Of 29 patients with limited -stage 
small cell lung cancer (SCLC) who were enrolled in a clin ical tr ial, 2 developed a confirmed 
tracheoesophageal fistula. Information on the background rate of tracheoesophageal fistula is 
limited, and the presence of other risk factors for tracheoesophageal fistula in the patients is 
unknown. However, the estimat ed back ground rate of tracheoesophageal fistula in patients with 
limited -stage SCLC is estimated to be < 1% [59]. Two distinct patterns of bleeding have occurred 
in patients receiving bevacizumab. Minor or moderate bleeding occurs more frequently in patients 
treated with bevacizumab vs. those treated with chemotherapy alone. These events were 
generally mild and resolved without medical intervention. NCI -CTC Grade 3 —5 hemorrhagic 
events occurred in 4.7% of non -small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients  and 5.2% of metastatic 
colon cancer pati ents receiving bevacizumab. In a randomized study in patients with NSCLC 
receiving chemotherapy with or without bevacizumab, 31% (4 of 13) bevacizumab -treated 

 MDACC# 2015 -0087  
 Version 11; February 1 , 2021  
29 
 patients with squamous cell histology and 4% (2 of 53) b evacizumab -treated patients with non -
squa mous cell histology experienced life -threatening or fatal pulmonary hemorrhage as 
compared to none of the 32 patients receiving chemotherapy alone. In another study the 
incidence of pulmonary hemorrhage requiring me dical intervention was 2.4% (10 of 427) i n 
patients receiving bevacizumab in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel versus 0.5% (2 of 
441) in patients receiving chemotherapy alone. Seven deaths due to pulmonary hemorrhage 
have been reported. Of the pa tients experiencing events of life -threat ening pulmonary 
hemorrhage, many had cavitation and/or necrosis of the tumor, either pre -existing or developing 
during bevacizumab therapy. The risk of CNS bleeding in patients with CNS metastases receiving 
bevacizu mab has not been evaluated; patients with  CNS metastases were excluded from 
bevacizumab studies after one such patient experienced CNS hemorrhage after receiving 
bevacizumab in a phase I trial [59]. A study of neoadjuvant bevacizumab in breast cancer patients 
did show in increase in early and delayed post -operative compl ications. [60] Serious adverse 
events in patients treated with bevacizumab included bleeding, thrombotic  events and GI 
perforation.  
Hypertension  
The incidence of severe hypertension (NCI CTC Grade 3 —4) across all bevacizumab clinical 
trials ranges from 8 —18%. In patients with non -small cell lung cancer treated with bevacizumab, 
the incidence of hypertension was 8% vs. 0.7% in patients receiving chemotherapy alone. 
Development or worsening of hypertension can require hospitalization or require  discontinuation 
of bevacizumab in 1.7% of patients. Severe hypertension complicated by subarachnoid 
hemorrhage or hype rtensive encephalopathy has been reported and, in some cases, has been 
fatal. In post -market reports, acute increases in blood pressure h ave been associated with initial 
or subsequent infusions of bevacizumab .[59] 
Proteinuria  
Proteinuria (defined as urine dipstick reading >= 1+)  occurs more frequently and is more severe 
in patients receiving bevacizumab as compared to those rece iving chemotherapy alone; the 
incidence of severe proteinuria (> 3.5 g/24 hours) ranged up to 3% in bevacizumab -treated 
patients across clinical trials. I n patients with non -small cell lung cancer treated with bevacizumab 
plus carboplatin/paclitaxel, the i ncidence of proteinuria was 3%. The safety of continued 
bevacizumab therapy or temporary suspension of the drug in patients with moderate to severe 
protei nuria has not been evaluated; such patients should be monitored regularly until 
improvement and/or res olution is observed. In most clinical studies, bevacizumab was interrupted 
for proteinuria exceeding 2 g per 24 hours and resumed when proteinuria decline d below this 
level[59].  
Congestive Heart Failure  
Congestive heart failure (C HF), defined a s NCI -CTC Grade 2 -4 left ventricular dysfunction, was 
reported in 25 of 1459 (1.7%) patients receiving bevacizumab in manufacturer -sponsored trials. 
In a controlled trial in patients with b reast cancer (non -FDA approved use), CHF occurred in 4% 
(13 of 299) of patients who r eceived prior anthracyclines and/or left chest wall radiation therapy. 
The safety of continuation or resumption of bevacizumab therapy in patients with cardiac 
dysfunction  has not been studied [59]. 
Infusion Reactions  
In clinical studies, infusio n reactions with the first bevacizumab dose were uncommon (less than 
3%). Severe infusion reactions occurred in 0.2% of patients receiving bevacizumab. Infusion 
reactions include hypertension, hypertensive crises associated with neurologic manifestations, 
wheezing, oxygen desaturation, grade 3 hypersensitivity, chest pain, headaches, rigors, and 
diaphoresis [59].  
 
5.4.3   Everolimus (Afinitor ®) 

 MDACC# 2015 -0087  
 Version 11; February 1 , 2021

 The obs erved antitumor and immunosuppressive properties of rapamycin analogs are due to their 
ability to  disrupt the mTOR -dependent signaling pathway. mTOR, a member of the 
phosphatidylinositide 3’ -kinase (PI3K) -related family, is located predominantly in the nuclear 
fraction of both neoplastic and normal cells. mTOR activation triggers resti ng cells to incr ease the 
translation of a subset of mRNAs whose proteins are required for cell cycle progression from G 1 
to S phase. mTOR regulates essential signal transduction pathways and is involved in the 
coupling of growth stimuli with cell cycle pro gression. Experi mental data indicate that mTOR acts 
downstream of the PI3K/Akt -pathway and is phosphorylated in response to mitogenic signals. 
Early studies reported that mTOR was dedicated to initiating mRNA translation in response to 
favorable nutrient e nvironments. In fact, cells treated with rapamycin undergo changes that are 
strikingly similar to those observed during conditions of starvation. These include mTOR 
inactivation, down regulation of translation, G 1 arrest, accumulation of glycogen stores an d 
altered transc ription patterns. More recent studies have demonstrated that mTOR is involved in 
regulating many aspects of cell growth, including organization of the actin cytoskeleton, 
membrane traffic, protein degradation, protein kinase C (PKC) signali ng, ribosome bio genesis, 
and transcription [61, 62]. 
Everolimus  reacts with the ubiquitous intracellular FK506 -binding protein 12 (FKBP12), forming a 
everoli mus/FKBP12 complex that is a potent inhibitor of the highly conserved kinase mTOR. 
Inhibition of mTOR leads to suppression of several downstrea m signaling effecto rs, including the 
ribosomal subunit p70S6k and the eukaryotic initiation factor 4 binding protein 1 (4E -BP1). These 
two proteins play key roles in ribosomal biogenesis and cap -dependent translation, respectively. 
The extent of phosphoryl ation of these two downstream proteins (p70S6 kinase and 4E -BP1) may 
therefore serve as indicators of everolimus  biologic activity in vivo [63]. Inhibition of the synthesis 
of ribosomal proteins and elongation fact ors, required to accelerate the process of cell division, 
are thought to contribute to the anti -proliferative effects of rapamycin analogs. While everolimus  
inhibits the translation of only a subset of mRNAs, inhibition of mTOR can lead to a substantial 
decrease (~15%) in overall protein synthesis [63]. The most common ADRs (incidence ≥1/10 and 
suspected to be r elated to treatment by the investigator) from the pooled safety data were (in 
decreasing order): stomatiti s, rash, fatigue, diarrhea, infections, nausea, decreased appetite, 
anemia, dysgeusia, pneumonitis, hyperglycemia, weight decreased, pruritus, astheni a peripheral 
edema, hypercholesterolemia, epistaxis, and headache. [64].  
The most common grade 3/4 ADRs (incidence ≥1/100 to <1/1 0 and suspected to be related to  
treatment by the investigator) were stomatitis, anemia, hyperglycemia, fatigue, inf ections,  
pneumonitis, diarrhea, asthenia, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, dyspnea, lymphopenia, 
proteinuria , hemorrhage, hypophosphatemia, rash, hypertension, aspartate aminotransferase 
(AST) increased, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) increased, and pneumoni a.

Description of selected adverse drug reacti ons 
In clinical trials and post -marketing spontaneous reports, everolimus has been associated with  
serious cases of the following:  
• Hepatitis  B reactiva tion, including fatal outcome. Reactivation of infections is  an expected 
event during periods of immunosu ppression.  
• Renal  failure events (including fatal ones) and proteinuria. Monitoring of renal function is 
recommended.  
• Amenorrhea  (including secondary a menorrhea).  
• Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PJP) some with a fatal outcome.  
• Angioedema has been reported  with and without concomitant use of everolimus and ACE 
inhibitors  
 
The table below lists all fatal adverse events reported by investigators across all  RAD001 studies 
as having a suspected causal relationship to everolimus and occurring on or before the cu t-off

The table below lists all serious, unexpected, life -threatening adverse events considered related 
to study drug, and reported on  at least one oc casion up to the cut -off date of 31 -Mar-2014. It 
should be stressed that many of  these SAE reports have been reported only on a single occasion 
making an accurate  assessment of causality difficult, if not impossi ble. Due to the imprecision of 
causality, th e causality assessments should not be assumed that all of these events are indeed 
the result of therapy with everolimus. Moreover, the assessment of causality is particularly difficult 
in critically ill patients where confounding factors are present relati ng mainly to complications of 
the underlying disease and to the use of prior therapy and/or concomitant medications. In addition 
to the SAE reports presented below, disease progression has on occasions been repor ted 
somewhat paradoxically as an SAE with a suspected causal relationship to everolimus and 
reported on at least one occasion.

 5.5 Therapy Administration and Dose Reductions  
NOTE: All toxicities should be graded according to the NCI Common Toxicity Criteria 
(version 4.0)  
All patients will initiate therapy on dose level 1 (Table 7). In a currently accruing phase I study, a 
dosing schedule of everolimus 7.5 mg PO on days 1 -21, bevacizumab 1 5mg/kg IV day 1 and 
liposomal doxorubicin 30mg/m2 IV on day 1, every 21 days  was well tolerated with no dose 
limiting toxicity. Although dose escalation within the phase I trial has demonstrated that higher 
dose s of everolimus  are feasible, there wa s a higher incidence of grade 3 mucos itis, a known 
toxicity of both evero limus and liposomal doxorubicin. Since metaplastic patients who developed 
response were treated with 7.5mg everolimus , this has been the dose cho sen to proceed forward 
in this clinical trial.  
Patients experiencing > grade 2 non -hematologic  drug toxicity that is unresponsive to 
symptomatic support may undergo dose reduction of the responsible drug (s) as indicated in 
Table 7. Other drugs within the r egimen can be continued at full dose per the treating physician’s 
discretion. If all three dru gs are reduced to dose level -2, the patient will be withdrawn from study. 
Therapy with everolimus should be held in patients with absolute neutrophil count < 100 0/mm3, 
hemoglobin < 8/mm3, platelet count  <50,000/mm3 and/or > grade 3 mucositis and/or hand f oot 
syndrome. Therapy may be resumed if neutrophil count improves to > 10 00/mm3, hemoglobin 
improves to > 8/mm3, platelet  count  improve s to >50,000/mm3 and/or muc ositis an d/or hand foot 
syndrome improve  to grade 1. Neutrophils and platelets must have recov ered to grade 2 prior to 
receiving subsequent cycles of therapy. Treatment may be held for up to 2 weeks for hematologic 
recovery, but therapy should be discontin ued if >2 weeks is required for hematologic recovery. 
Elevation in blood pressure  during therapy should be treated accordin g to guidelines for 
bevacizumab induced hypertension. Urine dipstick protein values of 2 or higher  should be 
confirmed by 24 -hour col lection  of urine . For proteinuria > 3.5g/24 hours, bevacizumab should be 
disconti nued. For proteinuria  1-3.5g/24 hours, bevacizumab should be held until proteinuria 
improves to < 2g/24 hours. If improvement to < 2g/24  hours is not seen in 4 weeks, bevacizu mab 
should be discontinued.  For proteinuria < 1g/24 hours, bevacizumab can be con tinued. Therapy 
will be admi nistered as indicated in Table 7 . 
5.5.1 Management of specific toxicities  related to everolimus administration:  
Overall, safety data available from  completed, controlled and uncontrolled studies indicate that 
everolimus is gener ally well tolerated at weekly or daily dose schedules. The safety profile is 
characterized by manageable adverse events (AEs). These AEs are generally reversible and 
non-cumul ative.  
Adverse events most frequently observed with everolimus are stomatitis, ra sh, diarrhea, fatigue, 
infections, asthenia, nausea, peripheral edema, decreased appetite, headache,  dysgeusia, 
epistaxis, mucosal inflammation, pneumonitis, weight decreased,  vomiting,  pruritus, cough, 
dyspnea, dry skin, nail disorder, and pyrexia.   Overa ll, the most frequently observed laboratory 
abnormalities include decreased hematology parameters including hemoglobin, lymphocytes, Table 7: Drug Dosing and Recommended Reductions for Toxicity *

 Management of infections  
Everolimus has immunosuppressive properties an d may predispose patients to bacterial, fu ngal, 
viral or protozoal infections, including  infec tions with opportunistic pathogens. Localized and 
systemic infections, including pneumonia, other bacterial infections, invasive fungal infections, 
such as asperg illosis or candidiasis and viral infection s including reactivation of hepatitis B virus, 
have been described in patients taking Everolimus Some of these infections have been severe 
(e.g. leading to sepsis, respiratory or hepatic failure) and occasionally h ave had a fatal outcome.  
Physicians and pa tients should be aware of the increased risk of infe ction with Everolimus Treat 
pre-existing infections prior to starting treatment with Everolimus. While taking Everolimus, be Toxicity  Action  
Any non -hematologic toxicity

 vigilant for symptoms and signs of in fection; if a diagnosis of infection is ma de, institute 
appropriate treatment promptly and con sider interruption or discontinuation of Everolimus.  
If a diagnosis of invasive systemic fungal infection is made, discontinue Everolimus and treat with 
appropria te antifungal therapy.  
Cases of pneumocyst is jirovecii pneumonia (PJP), some with a fatal outc ome, have been 
reported in patients who received everolimus. PJP may be associated with concomitant use of 
corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive agents.  Pro phylaxis for PJP should be considered 
when  concomitant use of corticosteroids or other immunos uppressive agents are required.  
 Management of skin toxicity  
For patients with grade 1 toxicity, no specific supportive care is usually needed or indicated. Rash 
must be reported as an AE. Patients with g rade 2 or higher toxicity may be treated with the 
following suggested supportive measures at the discretion of th e investigator: oral minocycline, 
topical tetracycline, topical clindamycin, topical silver sulfadiazine, diphenhydramine, oral 
prednisolone (s hort course), topical corticosteroids, or pimecrolim us. 
 Management of Hypersensitivity reactions  
Hypersensitivity reactions manifested by symptoms including, but not limited to, anaphylaxis, 
dyspnea, flushing, chest pain or angioedema (e.g. swelling of th e airways or tongue, with or 
without respiratory imp airment) have been observed with everolimus.  
 Angioedema with concomitant use of angiotensin -converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors  
Patients taking concomitant ACE inhibitor therapy may be at increased risk f or angioedema (e.g. 
swelling of the airways or tongu e, with or without respiratory impairment).  
 Renal Failure Events  
Cases of renal failure (including acute renal failure), some with fatal outcome, occurred in patients 
treated with everolimus. Renal funct ion of patients should be monitored particularly whe re 
patients have additional risk factors that may further impair renal function.  
Elevations of serum creatinine, usually mild, and proteinuria have been reported in patients taking 
everolimus. Monitoring of renal function, including measurement of blood ur ea nitrogen (BUN), 
urinary protein, or serum c reatinine, is recommended prior to the start of everolimus therapy and 
periodically thereafter.  
 Management of stomatitis, oral mucositis, mouth ulcers  
Patien ts with a clinical history of stomatitis/mucositis/m outh ulcers and those with gastrointestinal 
morbidity associated with mouth/dental infections, irritation of esophageal mucosa e.g. 
gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and pre -existing stomatitis/mucos itis must be monitored 
even more closely. Patients s hould be instructed to report the first onset of buccal mucosa 
irritation/reddening to their study physician immediately.  
Stomatitis/oral mucositis/mouth ulcers due to Everolimus should be treated using l ocal supportive 
care. Please note that investigators  in earlier trials have described the oral tox icities associated 
with Everolimus as mouth ulcers, rather than mucositis or stomatitis. If your examination reveals 
mouth ulcers rather than a more general i nflammation of the mouth, please classify the advers e 
event as such. The suggested paradigm for tr eatment of stomatitis/oral mucositis/mouth ulcers is 
as follows:  
1. For mild toxicity (grade 1), no dose ad justment required. Manage with non-alcoholic mouth 
wash or salt water (0.9%) mouth wash several times a da y until resolution.  
2. For more severe toxicity ( grade 2 in which case patients have pain but are able to maintain 
adequate oral alimentation, or grade 3 in which case patients cannot maintain adequate oral 
alimentation), the suggested treatments are topical analgesic mouth treatments (i.e., local 
anesth etics such as, benzocaine, butyl aminobenzoate, tetracaine hydrochloride, menthol, or 
 MDACC# 2015 -0087  
 Version 11; February 1 , 2021  
41 
 phenol) with or without topical corticosteroids, such as triamcinolone o ral paste 0.1% 
(Kenalog in Orabase®). 
3. Agents contain ing alcohol, hydrogen peroxide, iodine, and th yme derivatives may tend to 
worsen mouth ulcers.  These agents should be avoided.  
4. Antifungal agents should be avoided unless a fungal infection is diagnosed. In particular, 
systemic imidazole antifungal agents (ketoconazole, fluconazole, itraconazole, etc. ) should 
be avoided in all patients due to their strong inhibition of Everolimus metabolism, therefore 
leading to higher Everolimus exposures. Therefore, topi cal antifungal agents are preferred if 
an infection is diagnosed.

If stomatitis recur s at grade 2, interrupt dose until 
recovery to grade ≤1. Re -initiate Afinitor at a lower 
dose.  
Manage with topical analgesic mouth treatments  (e.g. 
benzocaine, butyl  aminobenzoate, tetracaine 
hydrochloride, menthol or phenol)  with or without 
topical cortic osteroids (i.e. triamcinolone oral paste)*.

benzocaine, butyl aminobenzoate, tetracaine 
hydrochloride, menthol or phenol) with or without 
topical corticosteroids (i.e. triamcinolon e oral paste)*  
 Grade 4 
(Symptoms 
associated with 
life-threatening 
consequences)  Discontinue Afinitor and treat with appropriate medical 
therapy.  
* using agents containing alcohol, hydrogen peroxide, iodine, and thyme derivatives in 
management of stomati tis as they may worsen mouth ulcers . 
 Management of Diarrhea  
Appearance of grade 1 -2 diarrhea attributed to study drug toxicity may be treated with supportive 
care such as loperamide, initiated at the earliest onset (for example 4 mg orally followed by 2 m g 
orally every 2 hours until resolution of diarrhea).  
 Management of Hyperl ipidemia and Hyperglycemia  
Treatment of hyperlipidemia should take into account the pre -treatment status and dietary habits 
of the patient. Grade 2 or higher hypercholesterolemia (> 300 mg/dL or 7.75 mmol/L) or grade 2 
hypertriglyceridemia or higher (>2.5x upper normal limit) should be treated with a 3 -hydroxy -3-
 MDACC# 2015 -0087  
 Version 11; February 1 , 2021  
42 
 methyl -glutaryl (HMG) -CoA reductase inhibitor (e.g. atorvastatin, pravastatin, fluvastatin) or 
appropriate triglyceride -lowering medication, in addition to diet.  
Note: Concomitant therapy with fibrat es and an HMG -CoA reductase inhibitor is associated with 
an increased risk of a rare but serious skeletal muscle toxicity manifested by rhabdomyolysis, 
markedly elevated creatine ph osphokinase (CPK) levels and myoglobinuria, acute renal failure 
and sometim es death. The risk versus benefit of using this therapy should be determined for 
individual patients based on their risk of cardiovascular complications of hyperlipidemia.  
Dyslipide mia (including hypercholesterolemia and hypertriglyceridemia) has been repo rted in 
patients taking everolimus.  Monitoring of blood cholesterol and triglycerides prior to the start of 
everolimus therapy and periodically thereafter as well as management wit h appropriate medical 
therapy is recommended.  
Hyperglycemia has been report ed in patients taking everolimus. Monitoring of fasting serum 
glucose is recommended prior to the start of Everolimus and periodically thereafter. More 
frequent monitoring is recomm ended when everolimus is co -administered with other drugs that 
may induce h yperglycemia. Optimal glycemic control should be achieved before starting a patient 
on Everolimus.

Adverse Drug Reaction  Severity  Afinitor  Dose Adjustment and Management 
Recommendations  
Metabolic events  
(e.g. 
hyperglycemia,  
dyslipidemia)  Grade 1  No dose adjustment required.  
Initiate appropriate medical therapy and monitor.  
 Grade 2  No dose adjustment required.

monitor.  
 Grade 3  Temporary dose interruption.  
Re-initiate Afinitor at lower dose.  
Manage with appropriate medical therapy and 
monitor.  
 Grade 4  Discontinue Afinitor  and treat with appropriate 
medical therapy.  
 Management of  non-infectious pneumonitis  
Non-infectious pneumonitis is a class effect of rapamycin derivatives. Cases of non -infectious 
pneumonitis (including interstitial lung disease) have also been describe d in patients taking 
Everolimus. Some of these have been sev ere and on rare occasions, a fatal outcome was 
observed.  
A diagnosis of non -infectious pneumonitis should be considered in patients presenting with non -
specific respiratory signs and symptoms such  as hypoxia, pleural effusion, cough or dyspnea, 
and in whom  infectious, neoplastic and other non -medicinal causes have been excluded by 
means of appropriate investigations. Opportunistic infections such as PJP should be ruled out in 
the differential diagn osis of non -infectious pneumonitis.  Patients should be advis ed to report 
promptly any new or worsening respiratory symptoms.  
Patients who develop radiological changes suggestive of non -infectious pneumonitis and have 
few or no symptoms may continue Afinito r therapy without dose alteration.  
If symptoms are moderate (grade 2), consideration should be given to interruption of therapy until 
symptoms improve.  The use of corticosteroids may be indicated.  Afinitor may be reintroduced at 
a daily dose approximatel y 50% lower than the dose previously administered.  
 MDACC# 2015 -0087  
 Version 11; February 1 , 2021  
43 
 For cases  of grade 3 non -infectious pneumonitis, interrupt Afinitor until resolution to less than or 
equal to grade 1.  Afinitor may be re -initiated at a daily dose approximately 50% lower than the 
dose pr eviously administered depending on the individual clinical c ircumstances.  If toxicity recurs 
at grade 3, consider discontinuation of Afinitor.  For cases of grade 4 non -infectious pneumonitis, 
Afinitor therapy should be discontinued.  Corticosteroids may be indicated until clinical symptoms 
resolve.  
For patients w ho require use of corticosteroids for treatment of non -infectious pneumonitis , 
prophylaxis for pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP) may be considered. The two compounds 
studied most extensively for prophylaxis against P JP have been trimethoprim -sulfameth oxazole, 
given orally, and pentamidine, given as an aerosol.  
If non -infectious pneumonitis develops, the guidelines in Table 12 should be followed. 
Consultation with a pulmonologist is recommended  for any case of pneumonitis that develops 
during the study.

5.5.2 Management of hepatitis reactivation / flare  
Reactivation of Hepatitis B (HBV) has been observed in patients with cancer receiving 
chemotherapy. [65] Sporadic cases of Hepatitis B reactivation have also been seen in this setting 
with everolimus. Use of antiv irals during anti -cancer therapy has been shown to reduce the risk of 
Hepatitis B virus reactivation and associated morbidity and mo rtality. [66] A detailed assessment 
of Hepatitis B/C medical history and risk factors  must be done for all patients at screening, with 
testing performed prior to t he first dose of everolimus.

of viral reactivation is the date on which the rise or reappearance of HBV -DNA was recorded.  
 
 
 Monitoring for hepatitis C flare  
The following two categories of patien ts should be monitored every 4 –8 weeks for HCV flare:  
• Patients with detectable HCV RNA -PCR test at screening.  
• Patients known to have a history of HCV infection, despite a negative viral load test at 
screening (including those that were treated and are considered ‘cured’)  
For definitions of HCV flare an d actions to be taken in the event of a flare, please refer  to Table

Patients must be instructed not to take any medications (over -the-counter or other products) 
during the protocol treatment period without prior consultation with the investigator. The 
investigator should instruct the patient to not ify the study site about any new medications he/she 
takes after the start of study drug. All medications (other than study drug) and significant non -
drug therapies (including physical therapy  and blood transfusions) taken within 28 days of starting 
study t reatment through the 30 -day safety follow up visit should be reported  in the patient’s EMR . 
6.1 Permitted concomitant therapy  
All supportive measures consistent with optimal patient care should be given throughout the 
study. Exceptions include the use of e rythropoietin to treat therapy induced anemia and use of 
myeloid growth factor support to treat neutropenia while taking evero limus. If everolimus is held 
for neutropenia, myeloid growth factors in the form of either GCSF or pegylated GCSF can be 
administe red beginning on either day 2 or 3 of each cycle. The use of growth factor support 
should follow ASCO guidelines.  
6.2 Cytochro me P450 and P -glycoprotein inhibitors/inducers/substrates  
Co-administration with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 or Pg P should be avoi ded; and may cause 
increased everolimus concentrations. For a current table of Substrates, Inhibitors and Inducers 
please acce ss the following website:  
http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/DevelopmentResources/DrugInteraction
sLabeling/ucm093 664.htm  
Everolimus is metabolized by CYP3A4 in the liver and to some extent in the intestinal wall.  
Therefore, the following are recommended:  
• Co-administration with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, 
ritonavir) or P -glycoprotei n (PgP) inhibitor should be avoided.  
• Co-administration with moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., erythromycin, fluconazole) or Pg P 
inhibitors should be used with caution. If a patient requires co -administration of moderate 
CYP3A4 inhibitors or PgP inhibitors,  reduce the dose of everolimus by approximately 50%. 
Additional dose reductions to every other day may be required to manage t oxicities. If the 
inhibitor is discontinued, the Everolimus dose should be returned to the dose used prior to 
initiation of the mo derate CYP3A4/PgP inhibitor after a washout period of 2 to 3 days.  
 MDACC# 2015 -0087  
 Version 11; February 1 , 2021  
48 
 • TSC with SEGA:  Everolimus trough concentrations should be a ssessed approximately 2 
weeks after the addition of a moderate CYP3A4/PgP inhibitor. If the inhibitor is discontinued 
the Afinitor  dose should be returned to the dose used prior to initiation of the inhibitor and the 
everolimus trough concentration should be re -assessed approximately 2 weeks later.  
• Grapefruit, Seville oranges, and starfruit affect P450 and PgP activity. Concomitant u se 
should be avoided.  
• If patients require co -administration of a strong CYP3A4 inducer, consider doubling the daily 
dose of Af initor (based on pharmacokinetic data), using increments of 5 mg or less. This dose 
of Afinitor is predicted to adjust the AUC to the range observed without inducers. However, 
there are no clinical data with this dose adjustment in patients receiving stron g CYP3A4 
inducers. If the strong inducer is discontinued, consider a washout period of at least 3 to 5 
days (reasonable time for s ignificant enzyme de -induction), before the Afinitor dose is 
returned to the dose used prior to initiation of the strong CYP3A 4 inducer.  
• TSC with SEGA Patients receiving concomitant strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., the enzyme 
inducing antiepileptic drugs carb amazepine, phenobarbital, and phenytoin) may require an 
increased Afinitor dose to attain trough concentrations of 3 to 15 ng/ mL. Double the daily 
dose of Afinitor and assess tolerability. Assess the everolimus trough level two weeks after 
doubling the dos e. Further adjust the dose if necessary to maintain the trough within the 3 to 
15 ng/mL range. If the strong inducer is discon tinued, the Afinitor dose should be returned to 
the dose used prior to initiation of the strong CYP3A4 inducer and the everolimus trough 
concentrations should be assessed approximately 2 weeks later.  
• This dose adjustment of Everolimus is intended to achiev e similar AUC to the range observed 
without inducers. However, there are no clinical data with this dose adjustment in patients 
receiving strong CYP3A4 inducers. If the strong inducer is discontinued the Everolimus dose 
should be returned to the dose used prior to initiation of the strong CYP3A4/PgP inducer.

6.3 Everolimus and drugs influencing CYP3A4 enzyme  
Everolimus is a s ubstrate of CYP3A4, and a substrate and moderate inhibitor of the multidrug 
efflux pump, PgP (PgP, MDR1, and ABCB1). The refore, extent of absorption and subsequent 
elimination of systemically absorbed everolimus may be influenced by products that are 
subst rates, inhibitors, or inducers of CYP3A4 and/or PgP. Concurrent treatment with strong 
CYP3A4 -inhibitors should be avoide d. Refer to  Table 16 f or a comprehensive list of inducers and 
inhibitors of CYP3A4 and Table 17 f or a list of relevant substrates, induc ers and inhibitors of PgP. 
Inhibitors of PgP may decrease the efflux of everolimus from brain or tumor and therefore 
increase everolimus concentrations in these tissues. In vitro studies showed that everolimus is a 
competitive inhibitor of CYP3A4 and of CY P2D6, potentially increasing the concentrations of 
products eliminated by these enzymes. Thus, caution should be exercis ed when co -administering 
everolimus with CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 substrates with a narrow therapeutic index. Clinical 
studies have been conduc ted in healthy subjects to assess pharmacokinetic drug interactions 

 MDACC# 2015 -0087  
 Version 11; February 1 , 2021  
50 
 between everolimus and potential CYP3A modifiers (ke toconazole, verapamil, erythromycin, 
rifampin, midazolam, and HMGCoA reductase inhibitors (statins).  
6.4 Vaccinations  
Immunosuppressant s may affect the response to vaccination and vaccination during treatment 
with Everolimus may therefore be less effectiv e. The use of live vaccines should be avoided 
during treatment with Everolimus. For pediatric patients with SEGA that do not require imm ediate 
treatment, complete the recommended childhood series of live virus vaccinations prior to the start 
of therapy acc ording to local treatment guidelines. Examples of live vaccines are: intranasal 
influenza, measles, mumps, rubella, oral polio, BCG, yel low fever, varicella, and TY21a typhoid 
vaccines.  
6.5 Prohibited concomitant therapy  
The concomitant use of therapeutic doses of anticoagulation is prohibited during treatment with 
bevacizumab. Patients requiring therapeutic doses of anticoagulation should  discontinue 
bevacizumab,  but may be allowed to continue liposomal doxorubicin and everolimus. The use of 
prophylactic a nticoagulation is allowed, but indication must be carefully considered due to the risk 
of bleeding associated with bevacizumab administr ation.  
Growth factors should not be used for the treatment of anemia or thrombocytopenia as such use 
has been associate d with decreased survival and increased thrombotic events in patients with 
breast cancer.  
7. Reporting of Adverse Events  
Definitions and  reporting  
7.1 Adverse Events  
Adverse events that begin or worsen after informed consent should be recorded in the Adverse 
Events CRF. Conditions that were already present at the time of informed consent should be 
recorded in the Medical Histor y page of the patient’s CRF. Adverse event monitoring should be 
continued for at least 30 days (or 5 half -lives, whichever is longer) following the last dose of study 
treatment. Adverse events (including lab abnormalities that  constitute AEs) should be des cribed 
using a diagnosis whenever possible, rather than individual underlying signs and symptoms. 
When a clear diagnosis cannot be identified, each sign or symptom should be reported as a 
separate Adverse Event.  
The occurrence of adverse events should be sought by non -directive questioning of the patient at 
each visit during the study. Adverse events also may be detected when they are volunteered by 
the patient during or between visits or through physical ex amination, laboratory te st, or other 
assessments. As far as possible, each adverse event should be evaluated to determine:  
1. The severity grade (CTCAE Grade 1 -4) 
2. Its duration (Start and end dates or if continuing at the Safety Follow -up Visit)  
3. Its relationsh ip to the study treatmen t (Reasonable possibility that AE is related: No, Yes)  
4. Action taken with respect to study or investigational treatment (none, dose adjusted, 
temporarily interrupted, permanently discontinued, hospitalized, unknown, not applicable)  
5. Whether medication or th erapy was given (no concomitant medication/non -drug therapy, 
concomitant medication/non -drug therapy)  
6. Outcome (not recovered/not resolved, recovered/resolved, recovering/resolving, 
recovered/resolved with sequ ela, fatal, unknown)  
7. Whether it is serious, whe re a serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as in  the Serious 
Adverse Events  subsection.  
All adverse events should be treated appropriately. Such treatment may include changes in study 
drug treatment including possible interruption or discontinuation, star ting or stopping concomitant 
treatments, changes in the frequency or nature of assessments, hospitalization, or any other 
medically required intervention. Once an adverse event is detected, it should be followed until its 
resolution , and assessment should be made at each visit (or more frequently, if necessary) of any 
changes in severity, the suspected relationship to the study drug, the interventions required to 
treat it, and the outcome.  
 MDACC# 2015 -0087  
 Version 11; February 1 , 2021  
51 
 Information about common side effects alread y known about the invest igational drug can be 
found in the [Investigators’ Brochure]  and below . This information should be included in the 
patient informed consent and should be discussed with the patient during the study as needed.  
Adverse event monitorin g should be continued fo r at least 30 days following the last dose of study 
treatment  
Laboratory test abnormalities  
Laboratory abnormalities that constitute an Adverse event in their own right (are considered 
clinically significant, induce clinical signs o r symptoms, require conc omitant therapy or require 
changes in study treatment), should be recorded on the Adverse Events CRF. Whenever 
possible, a diagnosis, rather than a symptom should be provided (e.g. anemia instead of low 
hemoglobin). Laboratory abnor malities that meet the c riteria for Adverse Events should be 
followed until they have returned to normal or an adequate explanation of the abnormality is 
found. When an abnormal laboratory or test result corresponds to a sign/symptom of an already 
reported  adverse event, it is no t necessary to separately record the lab/test result as an additional 
event.  
Laboratory abnormalities, that do not meet the definition of an adverse event, should not be 
reported as adverse events. A Grade 3 or 4 event (severe) as p er CTCAE does not automatically 
indicate a SAE unless it meets the definition of serious as defined b elow and/or as per 
investigator’s discretion. A dose hold or medication for the lab abnormality may be required by the 
protocol and is still, by definition , an adverse event.  
 
7.2 Serious Adverse Events  
A serious adverse event is an undesirable sign, symptom or medical condition which:  
• is fatal or life -threatening  
• results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• constitutes a congenital anomaly/bir th defect  
• requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, unless  
hospitalization is for:  
• routine treatment or monitoring of the studied indication, not associated with any deterioration 
in condition (specify what this includ es) 
• elective or pre -planned treatment for a pre -existing condition that is unrelated to the indi cation 
under study and has not worsened since the start of study drug  
• treatment on an emergency outpatient basis for an event not fulfilling any of the definiti ons of 
a SAE given above and not resulting in hospital admission  
• social reasons and respite care  in the absence of any deterioration in the patient’s general 
condition  
• is medically significant, i.e., defined as an event that jeopardizes the patient or may require 
medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above  
Reporting  
The principal  investigator has the obligation to report all seri ous ad verse events to the FDA and 
IRB. If the SAE is deemed definitely, probably or possibly related to everolimus, the investigator is 
obligated to notify Novartis Pharmaceuticals Drug Safety and Epidemio logy Department (DS&E)  . 
 
All events reported to the FDA by the investigator are to be filed utilizing the Form FDA 3500A 
(MedWatch Form).  
 
To ensure patient safety, every SAE, regardless of suspected causality, occurring  
• after the patient has provided in formed consent and until at least 30 days  after the patient has 
stopped study treatment/participation  
• after protocol -specified procedures begin (e.g., placebo run -in, washout period, double -blind 
treatment, etc.) and 30 day s after the patient has stopped s tudy treatment  
• after the start of any period in which the study protocol interferes with the standard medical 
treatment given to a patient (e.g., treatment withdrawal during washout period, change in 
 MDACC# 2015 -0087  
 Version 11; February 1 , 2021  
52 
 treatment to a fixed do se of concomitant medication) and  until 30 days after the patient has 
stopped study treatment  
 
must be reported to Novartis within 24 hours of learning of its occurrence  (fax: 877-778-9739) . 
This includes serious, related, labeled (expected) and serious, related, unlabeled (unexpected) 
adverse experiences. A ll deaths during treatment or within 30 days following completion of active 
protocol therapy must be reported within 5 working days.  
 
Any SAEs experienced after this 30 days  period should only be reported to Nov artis if the 
investigator suspects a causal r elationship to the study drug. Recurrent episodes, complications, 
or progression of the initial SAE must be reported as follow -up to the original episode within 24 
hours of the investigator receiving the follow -up information. A SAE occurring at a differen t time 
interval or otherwise considered completely unrelated to a previously reported one should be 
reported separately as a new event.  The end date of the first event must be provided.  
 
The original copy of th e SAE Report and the fax confirmation sheet m ust be kept within the Trial 
Master File at the study site.  
 
Follow -up information is sent to the same fax number as the original SAE Report Form was sent, 
using a new fax cover sheet, stating that this is a fol low-up to the previously reported SAE , and 
giving the date of the original report. Each re -occurrence, complication, or progression of the 
original event should be reported as a follow -up to that event regardless of when it occurs. The 
follow -up informatio n should describe whether the event has resol ved or continues, if and how it 
was treated, whether the blind was broken or not (if applicable), and whether the patient 
continued or withdrew from study participation.  
 
If the SAE is not previously documented in the Everolimus  Investigator Brochure or Pa ckage 
Insert (new occurrence) and is thought to be related to the Novartis study drug, a DS&E  associate 
may urgently require further information from the investigator for Health Authority reporting. 
Novartis may  need to issue an Investigator Notification ( IN), to inform all investigators involved in 
any study with the same drug that this SAE has been reported.  Suspected Unexpected Serious 
Adverse Reactions (SUSARs) will be collected and reported to the competent authorities and 
relevant ethics committees in  accordance with Directive 2001/20/EC or as per national regulatory 
requirements in participating countries.  
 
For Comparator Drugs/Secondary Suspects (Concomitant Medications), all serious adverse 
experiences wi ll be forwarded to the comparator  drug compan y by the investigator.  
 
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospitalization may be considered a serious adverse drug experience when, based upon 
appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patien t or subject and may req uire 
medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. All events 
occurring during the conduct of a protocol and meeting the definition of a SAE must be reported 
to the IRB in accordance with  the timeframes and proc edures outlined in “University of Texas M. 
D. Anderson Cancer Center Institutional Review Board Policy on Reporting Serious Adverse 
Events”.  Unless stated otherwise in the protocol, all SAEs, expected or unexpected, must be 
reporte d to ORERM, regardless o f attribution (within 5 working days of knowledge of the event). 
All life -threatening or fatal events, expected or unexpected, and regardless of attribution to the 
study drug, must have a written report submitted within 24 hours (ne xt working day) of knowl edge 
of the event to the Safety Project Manager in ORERM. The MDACC “Internal SAE Report Form 
for Prompt Reporting” will be used for reporting to ORERM. Serious adverse events will be 
captured from the time the patient signs consent  until 30 days after the  last dose of drug. Serious 
adverse events must be followed until clinical recovery is complete and laboratory tests have 
returned to baseline, progression of the event has stabilized, or there has been acceptable 
resolution of the event. Serious adverse e vents will be forwarded to FDA by the Safety Project 
Manager ORERM according to 21 CFR 312.32 .

7.3 Pregnancy  
Preclinical data regarding reproductive toxicity is described in the most recent Investigator 
Brochure. The potential rep roductive risk for humans is unknown.  Women of childbearing 
potential should be advised to use highly effective contraception methods while they are receiving 
everolimus and up to 8 weeks after treatment has been stopped.   
To ensure patient safety, each pregnancy occurring while the patient is on study treatment must 
be reported to Novartis within 24 hours of learning of its occurrence.  The pregnancy should be 
followed up to determine outcome, including spontaneous or voluntary termination, details of the  
birth, and the presence or absence of any birth defects, congenital abnormalities, or maternal 
and/or newborn complications. The newbo rn will be followed for at least 12 months.  
Pregnancy should be recorded on a Clinical Trial Pregnancy Form and reported by the 
investigator to the oncology Novartis Drug Safety and Epidemiology Department (DS&E). 
Pregnancy follow -up should be recorded on the same form and should include an assessment of 
the possible relationship to the study treatment and any pregnancy outc ome. Any SAE 
experienced during pregnancy must be reported on the SAE Report Form.  
 
7.4. Duration of Therapy  
Patients will receive pro tocol therapy unless:  
▪ Patient experiences unacceptable drug toxicity.  
▪ Patient withdraws consent.  
▪ Patient has progression  of diseas e as defined in section 9 .0.2 
▪ The patient completes the required 4 cycles of therapy.  
Duration of Follow -up  
For this protocol, all patients, including those who discontinue protocol therapy early, will be 
followed until 1 month after surgical re section of the tumor .  Date of last follow up clinic visit 
should be within 30  days (+/- 10 days) of surgical resection . Investigators also collect data  on 
recurrence 2 years after surgical resection of the tumor.  
Protection of human subjects  
All current F DA, NCI, state federal and institutional regulations concerning informed consent will 
be followed.  
In order to protect  confidential patient information , all study participants will be assigned a study 
ID number.  Specimens will be assigned a separate spec imen ID number.  All study information 
will be stored in locked file cabinets and in password -protected computer files.   Only authorized 
study personnel will have access to these files.

8.0 Study Calendar:  
 
 
8.1 Pretreatment E valuation  
• History and physical examination.  
• Laboratory studies: CBC with differential, sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, BUN, 
creatinine, glucose, calcium, magnesium, albumin, alkaline phosphatase, total b ilirubin, 
SGOT [AST], SGPT [ALT], Cholesterol, Tr iglycerides.   
• Urinalysis includes analysis (protein,  glucose, ketones, blood, and specific gravity).   
• Urine pregnancy test (WOCBP).  

 MDACC# 2015 -0087  
 Version 11; February 1 , 2021  
55 
 • Viral Screening: HBV -DNA, HBsAb, HBsAg, HBcAb , HCV -Ab, HCV -RNA  for patients with 
known Hepatitis B or C, or patients who fal l into the potential  risk category, or at the 
physic ian’s discretion.  
• Radiologic evaluation of measurable disease  within  4 weeks prior to start of treatment.  
• Patient must sign IRB -approved informed consent prior to any study -specific procedures 
unless suc h procedures ar e part of the standard of care.  
8.2 Evaluation during  Study  
▪ Physical examination (including vital signs, weight, per formance status): on day 1 of (or 
up to 3 days prior to)  each treatment cycle .  
▪ CBC with differential , sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, BUN, creatinine, 
glucose, calci um, magnesium, albumin, alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin, ALT, 
AST, urine pregnancy test within  48 hours prior to  starting each cycle of therapy.  
▪ Blood pressure and urinalysis  for evidence of proteinuria within 48 hours of starting each 
cycle of thera py. 
▪ Patients will undergo repeat imaging , +/- 7 days,  (mammogram, ultrasound and/or MRI, 
as clinically indicated) of the involved breast and axillary nodal basin as standard of 
care prior to surgical resection (after 4 cycles of therapy ) or at the time o f clinically 
suspected disease progression . 
8.3 Pregnancy and assessments of fertility  
There are no adequate data from the use of everolimus  in pregnant women. Studies in animals 
have shown reproductive toxicity effects including embryo -toxicity and feto -toxicity. The potential 
risk for humans is unknown. Everolimus should not be given to pregnant women unless the 
potential benefit outweighs t he potential risk to the fetus. If a pregnancy occurs while on study 
treatment, the newborn will be followed for at le ast 12 months.  
It is not known whether everolimus is excreted in breast milk. However, in animal studies 
everolimus and/or its metabolites  readily passed into the milk of lactating rats. Women taking 
everolimus should therefore not breast -feed.  
Women of ch ild-bearing potential, defined as all women physiologically capable of becoming 
pregnant, must use highly effective contraception during t he study and for 8 weeks after stopping 
treatment. Highly effective contraception is defined as either:  
• Total abstinen ce: When this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject. 
[Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothe rmal, post -ovulation methods) and 
withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception]  
• Sterilization: have had surg ical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) or tubal 
ligation at least six weeks before starting  study treatment. In case of oophorectomy alone, 
only when the reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone 
level ass essment  
• Male partner sterilization (with the appropriate post -vasectomy documentation of the absence 
of sperm i n the ejaculate). [For female subjects on the study, the vasectomised male partner 
should be the sole partner for that subject].  
• Use of a combina tion of any two of the following (a+b , or a+c , or b+c):  
a. Use of oral, injected, implanted or other hormonal meth ods of contraception  
 MDACC# 2015 -0087  
 Version 11; February 1 , 2021  
56 
 b. Placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS)  
c. Barrier methods of contraception: Condom or Occlusive  cap (diaphragm or 
cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/vaginal suppository  
• In case of use  of oral contraception, women should have been stable on the oral agent before 
taking study treatment.  
8.4 Male Contraception  
• Sexually active mal es must use a condom during intercourse while taking the drug and for 8 
weeks after stopping treatment and shou ld not father a child in this period.  
• A condom is required to be used also by vasectomised men in order to prevent delivery of the 
drug via semin al fluid.  
• Female partners of male patients must also be advised to use one of the following 
contraception metho ds: Use of (1) oral, injected, implanted or other hormonal methods of 
contraception, or (2) intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS ), or (3) prior 
male/female sterilization.  
8.5 Fertility  
The potential for everolimus to cause infertility in m ale and female patients is unknown. However, 
menstrual irregularities, secondary amenorrhea and associated luteinizing hormone ( LH)/follicle 
stimulating hormone (FSH) imbalance has been observed.  Based on non -clinical findings, male 
and female fertility ma y be compromised by treatment with everolimus.  
 
9. Measurement of Effect  
9.0.1 Pathologic response  
The RCB is a continuous variable derived from the  primary tumor dimensions, cellularity of the 
tumor bed, and axillary nodal burden. RCB can be divided into fou r classes (RCB -0 to RCB -III) 
and will be collected as part of the study.  
 
RCB -0 (pCR), Minimal RCB (RCB -I), Moderate RCB (RCB -II), and Extensive RCB (RCB -III) 
 
The following parameters are required from pathologic examination in order to calculate  
Residual Cancer Burden (RCB) after neoadjuvant treatment:  
 
▪ The largest two dimensions (mms) of the residual tumor bed in the breast (largest tumor 
bed if  multicentric disease)  
 
▪ Submission of the entire largest cross -sectional area of the residual tumor bed  for 
histologic mapping, with specific identification of those slides in the pathology report (e.g. 
"the largest cross -sectional area of primary tumor be d was submitted in cassettes A5 - 
A9") 
 
▪ If the residual tumor is large (i.e. largest diameter > 5 cm), then at least 5 representative 
cassettes from the largest cross -sectional area are sufficient, but should be identified in 
the original pathology report (e.g. "representative sections from the largest cross - 
sectional area of primary tumor bed were submitt ed in cassettes A5 - A9") 
 
▪ Histologic assessment of the percentage of the tumor bed area that contains carcinoma 
(all carcinoma, i.e. invasive and in sit u), select one of the following:  
 
o 0%, 1%, 5%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%

 ▪ To assess cellularity it is helpful to scan across the sections of tumor bed and then 
estimate the average cellularity from the different microscopic fields.  
 
▪ When e stimating percentage cancer cellularity in any microscopic field, compare the 
involved area  with obvious standards, e.g. more or less than half, one quarter, one fifth, 
one tenth, one twentieth, etc.  
 
▪ Expect there to be variable cellularity within the cros s section of any tumor bed, but 
estimate the overall cellularity from the average of the es timates in different microscopic 
fields of the tumor bed.  
 
o e.g. if cellularity in different fields of the tumor bed were estimated as 20%, 10%, 
20%, 0%, 20%, 30%, th en an average estimate of overall cellularity would be 
20%.  
 
▪ Histologic estimate of the per centage of the carcinoma in the tumor bed that is in situ, 
select one of the following:  
 
o 0%, 1%, 5%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 100%  
 
▪ The number of  positive (metastatic) lymph nodes  
 
▪ The largest diameter (mm) of the largest nodal metastasis  
 
9.0.2 Radiographic Imaging  
Radiographic criteria of response will be based on the on regional ultrasound examination 
(decrease in size of the primary tumor and/o r fatty repla cement in regional lymph nodes)  
▪ A decrease in size of the product of t he two largest dimensions should =/> 50% will be 
considered a partial response.  
▪ Complete disappearance of the primary tumor by physical exam and or ultrasound and 
normalizat ion of the lymph nodes by ultrasound will be considered a complete clinical 
respons e. 
▪ Progression of disease will be defined as 30% increase in the size of the primary tumor 
and/or lymph nodes by ultrasound.  
 
    9.2 Correlative Studies  
All molecular corre lative studies will involve molecular profiling data generated through biopsy of 
the primary breast tumor and profiled within the existing BMO molecular triaging protocol that is 
currently IRB approved  (MDACC 2014 -0185 ), for patients who participated on th at trial . Potential 
biomarkers of response will be correlated  with pathologic respo nse to DAE  using appropriate 
statistical analyses for the biom arker of interest (see Section 9 ). 
9.3Statistical Considerations  
9.3.1   Primary/Secondary Objectives:  
This is a non -randomized open label phase II study. Counting pCR (RCB -0) or RCB -I as 
response, a two -stage Gehan -type design will be employed with 14 patients in the first stage. If at 
least one patient responds, 23 more patients will be added for a total of 37 pa tients. This design 
has a 49% chance of terminating after the first stage if the true response rate is 0.05, 23% 
chance if the true rate is 0.10, 10% if the true rate is 0.15 and 4% if the true rate is 0.20. If accrual 
 MDACC# 2015 -0087  
 Version 11; February 1 , 2021  
58 
 continues to the second stage  and a t otal of 37 patients are enrolled, the 95% confidence interval 
for a 0.20 response rate will extend from 0.10 to 0.35. For patients who complete 4 cycles of 
DAE, the proportion of patients with pCR (RCB -0) or RCB -I as the response rate along with a 
Wilson ( score) 95% confidence interval (CI) will be estimated.  
Radiographic response rate (partial response + complete clinical response) will be estim ated, and 
reported with a 95% CI . 
Toxicity will be measured according to CTCAE v4.0.  Adverse events and serious  adverse events 
will be summarized in order of prevalence, with the highest grade experienced by each patient 
reported for each adverse event.   
PFS will be estimated using the K aplan -Meier method from the date of enrollment onto this study 
until the date of progression or death without evidence of progression. Patients alive and disease -
free at the latest clinical e valuation will be censored for P FS at the date of that evaluation . PFS 
will be reported with a 95% CI . 
9.3.2 Correlative  Studies:  
Potential bio markers of response will be correlated with pathologic response to DAE (this 
protocol) versus paclitaxel , using appropriate statistical analyses for the biomarker of interest.  
It is anticipated that mesenchymal gene signatures currently under development may predict 
response to therapy and response will be correlated in tumors categorized as mesenchymal 
using these signatures.  
Similarly, it is anticipated that vimentin staining w ill also be correlated with response. Protein 
expression will be graded 0, 1+,  2+ or 3+ by IHC by a single collaborating pathologist. Degree of 
expression will then be correlated with presence of mesenchymal signatures as well as response 
to therapy.  
Prese nce of mutations in PIK3CA, PTEN and NF2 will also be correlated with response . Further, 
multivariate logistic regression models will be fitted to the data that include three explanatory 
variables; namely dichotomous variables for treatment (DAE vs paclita xel), gene mutation, and 
the interaction.  The interaction will be examined to  investigate if the relationship between gene 
mutation status and pathologic response (RCB -0 or 1) is different for the two treatments. We are 
interested in fitting three such mo dels; specifically, one for mutations PIK3CA, PTEN and NF2  
10. Protocol amendments , or changes in study conduct  
Any change or addition (excluding administrative) to this protocol requires a written protocol 
amendment that must be reviewed by Novartis and the i nvestigator before implementation. 
Amendments significantly affecting the safe ty of subjects, the scope of the investigation or the 
scientific quality of the study require additional approval by the IRB at each study center.  A copy 
of the written approval  of the IRB must be provided to Novartis. Examples of amendments 
requiring suc h approval are:  
1. increases in drug dose or duration of exposure of subjects,  
2. significant changes in the study design (e.g. addition or deletion of a control group),  
3. increases in t he number of invasive procedures,  
4. addition s or deletions of a test procedure r equired for monitoring of safety.  
These requirements for approval should in no way prevent any immediate action from being 
taken by the investigator or by Novartis in the interes ts of preserving the safety of all patients 
included in the trial.  If an imme diate change to the protocol is felt to be necessary by the 
investigator and is implemented for safety reasons Novartis must be notified and the IRB at the 
center must be informe d immediately.   Amendments affecting only administrative aspects of the 
study  do not require formal protocol amendments or IRB approval but the IRB must be kept 
informed of such administrative changes. Examples of administrative changes not requiring 
formal protocol amendments and IRB approval include:  
1. changes in the staff used to monitor trials  
2. minor changes in the packaging or labeling of study drug.

 PROTOCOL SYNOPSIS 
Title of the Protocol:   A Phase 2, Double -blind, Randomized, Placebo -controlled Multicenter Study to 
Evaluate Efficacy, Safety, and Tolerability of JBT-101 in Systemic Lupus Erythematosus  
ACE Protocol Number:  ALE09  
Protocol Chair(s):   Meggan Mackay, M.D.   
IND Holder:   DAIT/NIAID, NIH  
Objective s:  To evaluate the efficacy , safety, tolerability, and biologic effects  of JBT-101. The primary 
objective is to evaluate effect on  inflammatory pain related to active musculoskeletal disease in SLE . 
Hypotheses/Estimates:   The hypothesis is that JBT-101 will provide clinical efficacy in SLE patients with at 
least moderate musculoskeletal disease activity by activation of pathways that resolve ongoing, adverse 
immune responses and inhibit inflammatory cytokine production asso ciated with SLE.  
Study Arms:   four cohorts :  
JBT-101 5 mg q a.m. and JBT-101 5 mg q p.m.  
JBT-101 20 mg q a.m. and placebo q p.m.  
JBT-101 20 mg q a.m. and JBT-101 20 mg q p.m.  
Placebo  q a.m. and placebo q p.m.  
Study Design:   One hundred eligible subjects will be randomized in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to one of four cohorts to 
receive either JBT-101 (three groups: 5 mg q a.m. and 5 mg  q p.m.,  20 mg q a.m. and placebo q p.m., 20 mg q 
a.m. and 20 mg q p.m.) or placebo for 84 days , then 28 days of follow -up. Subject visits to assess endpoints 
occur at six times: Days 1, 15 ± 3, 29 ± 3, 57 ± 3, 85 ± 3 and 113 ± 3.  
Endpoints:  
PRIMARY EFFICACY ENDPOINT:  
The primary endpoint for evaluation of the primary objective will be improvement i n maximum daily pain 
NRS scores in the treated groups relative to the control after 12 weeks of treatment.  Longitudinal trends over 
the course of the treatment period will be modeled and used to estimate differences between means at baseline 
and Day 84 fo r each treatment group.  
SECONDARY EFFICACY ENDPOINTS:  
1. The 7 -day average of maximum daily pain NRS scores prior to Visits 1  (Day 1) , 3 (Day 29) , 4 (Day 
57), 5 (Day 85) , and 6  (Day 113)  will be used to evaluate the number (%) of subjects with:  
 Changes in pain categories from Visit 1 (Day 1)  to Visits 3 (Day 29), 4 (Day 57), 5 (Day 85) 
and 6 (Day 113)  (See Section 6.2.2.2  Pain Categories ) 
 Improvement of 30% from Visit 1 (Day 1)  to Visits 3 (Day 29), 4 (Day 57), 5 (Day 85) and 6 
(Day 113)  
 Improvement of 50% from Visit 1 (Day 1)  to Visits 3 (Day 29), 4 (Day 57), 5 (Day 85) and 6 
(Day 113)    
 Improvement of 75% from Visit 1 (Day 1)  to Visits 3 (Day 29), 4 (Day 57), 5 (Day 85) and 6 
(Day 113)    
 Improvement of 100% from Visit 1 (Day 1)  to Visits 3 (Day 29), 4 (Day 57), 5 (Day 85) and 
6 (Day 113)    
2. Trends in active musculoskeletal disease activity over the duration of the treatment period (i.e. Visit 1 
(Day 1)  through Visit 5 (Day 85) ) will be evaluated longitudinally using multiple indices:  
 Physician assessed tender joint count  
 Physician assessed swollen joint count  
 Presence or absence of arthritis on the SELENA SLEDAI  
 Musculoskeletal domain of the BILAG 2004  
3. Persistence of trends in musculoskeletal disease activity after stopping treatment will be evaluated at 
Visit 6 (Day 113)  
4. Trends in overall SLE disease activity over the duration of the treatment period (i.e. Visit 1 (Day 1)  
through Visit 5  (Day 85) ) will be evaluated longitudinally using multiple indices:  
 SLE Responder Index , where a responder is defined as having all of the following:  
o ≥4 point reduction in SELENA -SLEDAI score,  
o no new BILAG A or no more than 1 new BILAG B domain score, and

 Title of the Protocol:   A Phase 2, Double -blind, Randomized, Placebo -controlled Multicenter Study to 
Evaluate Efficacy, Safety, and Tolerability of JBT-101 in Systemic Lupus Erythematosus  
o no deterioration from baseline in the Physician's Global Assessment defined as an 
increase of ≥0.3 points.  
 SELENA SLEDAI score  
 BILAG 2004 score  
 Physician’s Global Assessment  
5. Persistence of trends in overall SLE disease activity after stopping treatment will be evaluated at Visit 
6 (Day 113)  
6. Trends in patient -reported outcomes over the duration of the treatment period (i.e. Visit 1 (Day 1)  
through Visit 5 (Day 85) ) will be evaluated longitudinally using multiple indices:  
 Lupus Activity Patient Global Assessment  
 PROMIS -29 Short Form  
 PROMIS Item Bank v2.0 - Cognitive Function  
7. Treatment Satisfaction Survey  
8. Persistence of trends in patient -reported outcomes after stopping trea tment will be evaluated at Visit 6 
(Day 113)  
SAFETY ENDPOINTS:  
Safety will be evaluated by describing incidence of treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) from Visit 1  
(Day 1)  through Visit 6 (Day 113) . The TEAEs will be identified by monitoring subject -reported AEs, Adverse 
Events of Special Interest , vital signs, medical history, physical examination, blood and urine laboratory safety 
tests, 12 -lead electrocardiograms, including QT/QTc measurements, and Addiction Research Center Inventory -
Marijuana scal e. Analyses on the following specific events are planned.  
1. Any Grade 3 or higher AE or SAE that, in the opinion of the blinded site investigator, is  at least 
“possibly  related to study product. Unless noted otherwise, grading is defined by the National Cancer 
Institute (NCI) - Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) system version 4.0  
2. QTc prolongation > 500 msec total duration and > 60 msec from Visit 1 (Day 1)  QTc interval prior to 
study drug administration  
3. Mild/moderate and severe disease flares by SELENA SLEDAI Flare Index  
4. BILAG 2004 disease flares, defined as one new BILAG A or two new BILAG B scores  
5. Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminot ransferase (ALT) ≥ 3 x upper limit of normal  and 
total bilirubin > 1.5 x the upper limit of normal (confirmed on repeat testing)  
6. Tolerability, assessed by incidence of discontinuation of study product due to TEAEs at least 
“possibly”  related to study produ ct from Visits 1  (Day 1) through 5 (Day 85)  
7. Psychotropic activity, assessed using the ARCI -M 
MECHANISTIC ENDPOINTS:

2.  Persistence of trends in C -reactive protein levels after stopping treatment will be evaluated at Visit 6 
(Day 113)  
3. Trends in pro -inflammatory cytokine levels over the duration of the treatment period  (i.e. Visits 1  
(Day 1) , 3 (Day 29)  and 5  (Day 85) ) will be evaluated longitudinally using multiple indices:  
 Pro-inflammatory cytokines in serum  
i. IFN, IFN, IL-6, TNF , and IL -1

 Pro-inflammatory eicosanoids  
6. Changes  in plasma concentrations of JBT-101 and its metabolites  from Visit 1 (Day 1)  (pre and post 
dose)  to Visit 2 (Day 15)  
 
EXPLORATORY ENDPOINTS:  
1. Fibromyalgia Symptom Scale score , from Visit 1 (Day 1)  to Visits 5 (Day 85) and 6  (Day 113)  
Sample Size:   100 eligible subjects will be randomized within 24 months and followed for 112 days ; the study 
duration is estimated to be  33 months . 
 
 
Lay Summary: 
One hundred adults with SLE and active joint disease with at least moderate pain will be 
enrolled in this study to evaluate the safety, efficacy, and mechanisms of action of JBT-101. 
JBT-
101 is a synthetic endocannabinoid receptor type 2 (CB2) agonist and an activator of the 
body’s
 normal processes to resolve innate immune responses without immunosuppression.  
JBT-101 induces a class switch in production of lipid mediators to increase production of 
“Speci
alized Pro-resolving lipid Mediators” (SPMs) while reducing production of pro-
inflamm
atory mediators.  In turn, SPMs trigger a physiologic network to resolve 
inflammation and fibrosis, and, when present, increase clearance of pathogens.  With return 
to hom
eostasis, clinical benefit is expected to occur in people with SLE, for example, in 
those who have inflammation of the musculoskeletal system and associated pain.   
Subjects will be randomized to receive 2 daily oral doses of JBT-101  (three groups of 
varying doses; JBT-101 10 mg daily, JBT-101 20 mg daily or JBT-101 40 mg daily) or 
pla
cebo for 84 days and will continue to be followed for an additional 28 days. Subject visits 
to assess endpoints occur on Day 1, then every 2 weeks twice, then every 4 weeks three 
ti
mes, for six total visits after randomization. The study will compare changes over time in 
dai
ly measures of the maximum pain NRS in treated groups compared to the placebo group 
after
 12 weeks of treatment. Studies are also planned to evaluate tolerability and 
inflamm
ation.

 1 BACKGROUND INFORMATION AND SCIENTIFIC RATIONALE 
1.1 Disease Background 
 Descri
ption and Epidemiology of Disease 1.1.1
Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic and serious illness that has no cure and for 
which cur
rent therapeutic strategies have limited efficacy and significant toxicities. 
SLE is a prototypical autoimmune disease with a wide array of clinical manifestations, 
inc
luding rash, photosensitivity, oral ulcers, arthritis, pleuritis, pericarditis, kidney problems, 
seizures and psychosis, and blood cell abnormalities [ 1]. Patients with SLE have an increased 
frequency of rel
ated autoimmune problems, such as Sjögren’s syndrome and 
ant
iphospholipid syndrome (i.e., clotting problems, strokes, fetal loss) that require additional 
treatments. S LE may occur with other autoimmune conditions, such as thyroiditis, hemolytic 
anemia, and idiopathic thrombocytopenia purpura. Accelerated atherosclerosis among SLE 
pat
ients is responsible for premature mortality [ 2, 3]. 
The m
usculoskeletal system is the most commonly involved system in SLE, with reported 
incidences of 69-95% in different series [ 4-6]. Arthritis is the most commonly reported of all 
11 A
merican College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria for the diagnosis of SLE [ 1]. In 
addi
tion, arthritis is the first manifestation of SLE in about 60-70% of patients [ 1, 7]. After 
five year
s of disease, joint involvement affects about 85% of patients [ 1]. Tendon 
inflamm
ation, manifesting as tendonitis, tenosynovitis or tendon rupture, has been well 
described in SLE, occurring in 23-44% of patients [ 8-10]. A small percentage of SLE 
patients develop Jaccoud’s arthropathy due to recurrent episodes of inflammation resulting in 
ligamentous laxity and joint subluxation. In addition to joint symptoms, generalized myalgia 
is frequently associated with SLE, occurring in as many as 80% of SLE cases [ 10]. This 
myalgia
 characteristically affects the deltoids and quadriceps and occurs during disease 
flares. 
Musculoskeletal involvement in SLE is associated with pain. Chronic pain is a common 
entity for most SLE patients, resulting in a significant reduction in quality of life and 
productivity [ 11-14]. In focus groups of SLE patients, pain was the most frequently identified 
heal
th issue, occurring in > 85% of patients [ 15]. Indeed, SLE patients have higher visual 
anal
ogue pain scores than patients with rheumatoid arthritis [ 16]. Satisfaction of SLE patients 
with t
heir medical care is inversely related to their level of pain [ 17]. 
In addition to pain caused by active musculoskeletal inflammation, SLE patients may 
experience pain from concurrent fibromyalgia. About 16-32% of SLE patients also meet 
criteria for fibromyalgia [ 18]. 
Im
provement in patient-reported pain in SLE is associated with improvement in patient 
overall health [ 19]. Pain responders have greater improvement in Medical Outcome Study 
Clinical Protocol: ALE09  Page 17 of 125 CONFIDENTIAL  
 
 
Version 4.0   05 October  2018 
 Short Form-36 Survey scores, patient global health assessment scores, and Physician’s 
Global Assessment, compared to non-responders [ 19].  
 Im
munopathogenesis of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus  1.1.2
SLE is a disease characterized at a molecular level by loss of tolerance resulting in 
autoreactive B and T cells, abnormally primed dendritic cells, autoantibody production [ 20, 
21], generation of immune complexes, and their deposition in tissues. The characteristic 
ser
ologic feature of SLE is autoantibodies against one’s own nucleic acid or DNA- or RNA-
bindi
ng nuclear proteins [ 22]. These immune complexes have been shown to activate innate 
imm
une responses through toll-like receptors, Fcγ receptors and complement [ 23-25]. 
Chronic
 activation of innate immune responses by immune complexes in SLE can lead to 
production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as type 1 interferons (IFNs), with subsequent 
local activation of dendritic cells, presentation of self-antigen, and perpetuation of 
autoimmunity. Interferons, particularly the type 1 IFNα, are implicated in the pathogenesis of 
SLE [26]. Many patients with SLE display up-regulation of type 1 IFN-inducible genes, 
referred to as the “type 1 IFN gene signature”, and some have elevated serum levels of IFNα 
[27-29]. Elevated serum and tissue levels of multiple other pro-inflammatory cytokines, 
inc
luding IFNα, interleukin (IL)-1, IL-2, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12, IL-18, IFNγ, BAFF and tumor 
necrosis factor α (TNFα) have been implicated in the immune-pathogenesis of SLE [ 30-34]. 
These m
olecules mediate tissue destruction and contribute to breaking tolerance through 
effects on further B cell activation, auto-antibody production and expression of costimulatory 
molecules on lymphocytes[ 30, 35, 36] . Specifically, plasma levels of IL-6 have been 
cor
related with lupus arthritis [ 37]. 
This s
elf-amplifying cycle of ongoing activation of innate immune responses and subsequent 
perpetuation of autoimmunity underpins the immunopathogenesis of SLE. As a consequence, 
SLE is a disease characterized at the tissue level by chronic inflammation, which causes local 
pain, tissue damage, and organ dysfunction. This immune pathology can translate clinically 
to ongoing joint and periarticular inflammation with chronic musculoskeletal pain [ 38]. 
 Current Treatment of Active Musculoskeletal Involvement in Systemic 1.1.3
Lupus Erythematosus 
Treatments approved by the FDA specifically for the treatment of SLE include only 
hydroxychloroquine, corticosteroids, aspirin, and most recently, belimumab [ 39, 40]. As an 
indi
cator of the dearth of new treatments for SLE, belimumab was the first treatment 
approved for SLE in 50 years [ 39].  
Tradi
tional treatment strategies for active joint involvement in SLE generally begin with the 
use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), anti-malarial drugs, and non-
narcotic analgesic drugs, then escalate with symptom severity to include corticosteroids or 
other immunosuppressive drugs and narcotic analgesic drugs  [41]. These therapies can be 
li
mited in their efficacy and associated with toxicities [ 42-44]. Nonsteroidal anti-
inflammatory drugs are relatively contraindicated in SLE patients with renal disease. 
Clinical Protocol: ALE09  Page 18 of 125 CONFIDENTIAL  
 
 
Version 4.0   05 October  2018 
 Potential toxicities of NSAIDs, including enhanced photosensitivity, aseptic meningitis, 
gastrointestinal irritation, ulcers, bleeding and renal toxicity limit their use in SLE patients. 
Hydroxychloroquine
, an antimalarial agent which modulates the innate immune system, is 
commonly used to limit exposure to corticosteroids and to target constitutional and 
musculoskeletal features of disease. While its safety profile is relatively non-toxic and there 
is evidence that it decreases organ damage and prolongs states of remission, the acute 
therapeutic effect of hydroxychloroquine is mild [ 45]. 
Corti
costeroids and/or immunosuppressive agents are used for joint involvement in SLE 
patients that is refractory to NSAIDs and anti-malarial treatments [ 46], even though the 
pat
ients are at risk for developing cumulative toxicities from exposure to these drugs. For 
example, avascular necrosis is an extremely painful and debilitating problem that is 
associated with corticosteroid use and occurs in approximately 37% of SLE patients [ 47]. 
Other
 potentially devastating side effects of corticosteroids include infection, weight gain, 
osteoporosis, cataracts, and diabetes. The pro-atherogenic effects (hypertension, 
dyslipidemia, metabolic syndrome) of steroids are particularly disturbing, given the 
accelerated atherosclerosis associated with SLE [ 2, 3]. Immunosuppressive medications such 
as a
zathioprine, methotrexate, mycophenolic acid, leflunomide, cyclophosphamide, 
cyclosporine used to treat joint involvement in SLE are associated with multiple toxicities. 
Co
mmon toxicities include infections (some with fatal outcomes), hepatic, bone marrow and 
renal impairment, and infertility. Infection is a major contributor to morbidity and mortality 
in SLE [ 48-51]. 
Narcot
ic analgesia can afford relief of pain from joint involvement, but complications o f 
narcotic analgesics, including somnolence, constipation, addiction/dependence, fatigue and 
nausea, can be formidable. There is a rapidly increasing awareness of the dramatic rise in 
opioid-related abuse, addiction and overdose-related deaths [52]. 
Dire
ctly relevant to the treatment of active musculoskeletal disease in SLE are four recent 
treat- to-target recommendations in SLE from an international task force [ 53]. In redacted 
ver
sion, these four recommendations are: the treatment target should be remission of organ 
manifestations; factors such as pain that negatively influence health-related quality of life 
should be addressed; maintenance treatment should aim for the lowest glucocorticoid dose 
needed to control disease; and relevant therapies adjuvant to any immunomodulation should 
be considered to control comorbidity in SLE. 
Clearly, there is a significant unmet need for improved treatment of joint involvement and 
associated pain in patients with SLE who are refractory to NSAIDS and anti-malarial 
therapy, to resolve joint inflammation, improve pain, and avoid or reduce the risk of infection 
and the need for systemic corticosteroid therapy, immunosuppressive medications, and/or 
chronic narcotic analgesia.

 1.2 Rationale for JBT-101 
 Special
ized Pro-resolving Lipid Mediators Induce Resolution of 1.2.1
Inflammation, Infection, and Fibrotic Processes 
Inflammation normally resolves. Physiologic resolution of innate immune responses occurs 
when naturally-occurring counter- regula tory processes are sufficient to overcome the pro-
inflammatory milieu [ 54-57]. The key up-stream event in resolution of innate immune 
re
sponses is “class switch” of bioactive lipid mediators from pro-inflammatory mediators, 
such as leukotriene B4 and prostaglandin E2, to specialized pro-resolving lipid mediators 
(
SPMs), including lipoxins, resolvins, maresins, and protectins [ 58]. The SPMs initiate 
re
solution of innate immune responses, including resolution of inflammation, bacterial 
infection, and fibrotic processes, thereby restoring homeostasis [ 54-57].  
Resolut
ion of innate immune responses is an active and orchestrated process that is not the 
same as anti-inflammation or immunosuppression [ 54]. Resolution of immune responses 
inc
orporates multiple pathways to restore homeostasis [ 54-57] including: 
 Inc rease in production of SPMs and anti-inflammatory eicosanoids, with a 
concomitant decrease in production of pro-inflammatory eicosanoids [ 54-57] 
 Inc rease in production of IL-10 [ 59], an anti-inflammatory cytokine, coupled with a 
decr
ease in production of pro-inflammatory cytokines [ 60, 61], pro-fibrotic growth 
factor
s [62, 63], and extracellular matrix [ 64] 
 Inc rease in influx of non-inflammatory macrophages [ 65, 66], with a decrease in 
influx and accum
ulation of inflammatory cells and pro-fibrotic myofibroblasts [ 63, 
65, 67] in inflamed tissues. This includes inhibition of adhesion molecule expression, 
chem
okine production, and migration of inflammatory cells into tissues [ 67-70] 
 Inc rease in apoptosis of inflammatory cells, including neutrophils [ 70-72] and p ro-
fibrotic cells, including fibroblasts [ 73], in involved tissues 
 Inc rease in autophagy in inflammatory cells [ 60] 
 Inc rease in clearance of apoptotic cells and cellular debris by non-inflammatory 
macrophages [ 67, 70, 72] 
 Inc rease in bacterial clearance. SPMs stimulate production of bactericidal peptides 
[74], enhance phagocytosis and killing of bacteria by neutrophils and macrophages 
[71, 75-77] and enhance the antibacterial effects of antibiotics [ 78] 
 Subsequent  increase in migration of non-inflammatory macrophages out of 
previously inflamed tissues through efferent lymph [ 67], completing the return to 
ho
meostasis 
The cumulative effect is that class switch of eicosanoids to increase production of SPMs 
results in activation of a naturally occurring, broad-reaching, physiologic network that 
resolves innate immune responses, including inflammation, infection, and fibrotic processes, 
restoring homeostasis without immunosuppression.

  Proposed Mechanism of Action of JBT-101, a Synthetic CB2 Agonist 1.2.2
JBT-
101, a fully synthetic endocannabinoid-mimic, is proposed to activate the resolution 
machi
nery of innate immune responses, through cannabinoid type 2 receptor ( CB2)-mediated 
responses. The endocannabinoid system consists of endocannabinoids, CB receptors, and the 
machinery dedicated to endocannabinoid synthesis, cellular uptake, and degradation. The 
resolution machinery of innate immune responses and the endocannabinoid system have 
many common characteristics. Both are naturally occurring, primitive, and conserved 
biologic networks whose inherent purpose is to restore homeostasis following times of stress 
[79-82]. Receptors and natural ligands in both systems can be expressed on demand upon cell 
activation. Both systems use ligands that are synthesized from membrane phospholipids such 
as arachidonic acid and docosahexaenoic acid during calcium-activated biosynthetic 
pathways [ 83, 84]. Ligands for both systems act in an autocrine and paracrine fashion [ 85, 
86]. 
There
 are two main endocannabinoid receptor subtypes: cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1), 
mainly expressed in the central and peripheral nervous system, and CB2, mainly distributed 
throughout immune and hematopoietic cells [ 87-89]. Cell surface expression of CB2 is 
ra
pidly up-regulated on multiple immune cell types during immune responses [ 90-92]. 
Expres
sion of CB2 on immune cells is 10-100 times greater than CB1 expression [ 88]. 
JBT-101 is a full agonist of CB2, with limited ability to cross the blood-brain barrier [ 93] and 
act
ivate CB1 in the brain, through which psychoactivity of cannabinoids is mediated. The 
composition of JBT-101 that will be used in this trial has a 12 times greater affinity for CB2 
tha
n CB1 [ 94]. 
Based on human and animal model data and other pre-clinical studies, JBT-101  is proposed 
to be an upstream activator of the resolution machinery of innate immune responses inducing 
a class switch in production of bioactive eicosanoids to favor SPMs. This class switch in 
eicosanoids is expected to initiate a naturally-occurring, physiologic biologic network that 
will resolve chronic inflammation, without immunosuppression. Clinical benefit is expected 
with return of homeostasis, including improvement in signs and symptoms of active SLE, 
including multiple measures of active musculoskeletal inflammation, and a reduction in 
dise
ase flares. Because its proposed mechanism of action does not include 
immunosuppression or narcotic analgesia, treatment with JBT-101 is expected to be safe 
enough and wel
l tolerated for long-term use in SLE. To our knowledge, there are no other 
therapies in development for SLE at this time that are designed to induce class switch of 
bioactive eicosanoids to increase SPMs and resolve inflammation in SLE, emphasizing the 
uniqueness of JBT-101 as a potential treatment for SLE. In addition to its expected clinical 
benefit
 based on this novel mechanism of action, JBT-101  is expected to have an acceptable 
safety profile, based in part on its relative specificity for CB2, limited penetration of the 
blood-brain barrier penetration, and lack of psychoactivity associated with CB1/ 
tetrahydrocannabinol agonists/mimetics. As of January 2017, JBT-101 has been tested in a 
cl
inical trial in Systemic Sclerosis (SSc), and there are two ongoing clinical trials in 
inflamm
atory myositis and cystic fibrosis. No serious adverse events attributed to JBT-101 in 
these 3 clinical trials have been reported. There is no reason to suspect that a SLE population 
Clinical Protocol: ALE09  Page 21 of 125 CONFIDENTIAL  
 
 
Version 4.0   05 October  2018 
 will be at greater risk for potential JBT-101 toxicity than any of these 3 immune-
compromised populations. 
 Summary of Biologic Effects of JBT-101 1.2.3
The biologi
c effects of JBT-101 that are relevant to the treatment of SLE are outlined here, 
and dat
a in support of these effects can be found in more detail in the Investigator’s Brochure 
(IB) for JBT-101. In humans, human cells, and/or animal models of inflammation, JBT-101 
inc
reases production of the SPM lipoxin A4 and anti-inflammatory eicosanoids such as 
PGD2 and PGJ2, while decreasing production of pro-inflammatory eicosanoids and pro-
inflamm
atory cytokines that have been implicated in SLE, including IFNα, IL-6, and IL-1β 
[62, 63, 95-101 ]. In other animal models of disease, JBT-101  inhibits tissue inflammation 
and edema, as well as tissue damage caused by inflammation [ 62, 63, 95, 96, 98, 101]. Of 
signi
ficance, JBT-101 inhibits lung inflammation and fibrosis, when administered in both 
pre
ventative and therapeutic manners in rodent models [ 63, 102]. In one animal model of 
prol
onged and excessive lung inflammation induced by persistent infection, JBT-101 restores 
re
solution of lung inflammation to normal, improves bacterial clearance, lessens associated 
weight loss, and improves survival, without immunosuppression [ 102]. JBT-101 also 
pre
vents development of inflammation and fibrosis in the skin in animal models [ 62, 101]. 
JBT-
101 has direct effects on fibroblasts that may reduce fibrosis, including inhibition of 
TGF
β and collagen production [ 62, 63 ] . 
The human equivalent dose (HED), based on body surface area, of effective/ active doses in 
rodent models were between about 0.5 - 60 mg per day total daily dose, with a median HED 
of
 about 5 mg per day (difficulties in translating doses in animal models to human equivalent 
doses are acknowledged). 
Potentially relevant to the treatment of SLE and inflammatory arthritis in SLE, preliminary 
studies done by the Protocol Chairs and collaborators have demonstrated that JBT-101 
re
duces production of IFNα and IFNγ by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from 
heal
thy volunteers and from patients with SLE ex vivo. In summary, the results showed: 
 JBT-101  reduced release of IFNα and IFNγ from PBMC from both healthy volunteers 
and five SLE patients, when those PBMC were stimulated with CpG DNA (for IFNα 
production) or phytohemagglutinin (for IFNγ production), p < 0.05 (see Figure 1). 
 In a  dose-dependent manner, JBT-101  reduced levels of IFNα mRNA in PBMC from 
an SLE patient, when those PBMC were stimulated with CpG DNA, p < 0.05 [ 101]. 
 W hen added to SLE PBMC stimulated with CpG DNA ex vivo , 30 μM JBT-101  
reduced IFNα production in 7/9 (78%) of subjects, with inhibition in those seven 
subjects ranging from 42% to 97%. Similarly, when added to SLE PBMC stimulated 
with phytohemagglutinin ex vivo , 30 μM JBT-101 reduced IFNγ production in 5/6 
(83%
) of subjects, with inhibition in those five subjects ranging from 48% to 85%. 
Suppression of both IFNα and IFNγ production was independent of Systemic Lupus 
Erythematosus Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI) scores [ 101].

 Figure 1. JBT-101  decreases IFN 
production by ex vivo stimulated PBMC 
from SLE patients  
Legend: Panel A. PBMC were isolated from 
five SLE patients and stimulated with 
phytohemagglutinin without or with 30 uM 
JBT-101. IFNγ release from these PBMC was 
reduc
ed 63.5 +/- 13.9% (mean +/- SD) by 
addit
ion of JBT-101 (p = 0.001 versus 
untre
ated, stimulated control cells by student t 
test).  
Panel B. PBMC were is
olated from five SLE 
patients and stimulated with CpG DNA 
without or with 30 uM JBT-101. IFNα release 
from t
hese PBMC was reduced by JBT-101 (p 
< 0.001 vs unt
reated, stimulated control cells 
by student t test).  
In support of these findings in PBMC from 
SLE patients, JBT-101 decreased production of IFNα by PBMC from dermatomyositis 
pat
ients [ 100].  
In a
ddition, in support of potential benefit of JBT-101 in musculoskeletal inflammation in 
SLE
, JBT-101 at doses equivalent to 0.5 mg every other day in humans inhibited adjuvant-
induce
d arthritis in rodents, with prevention of pannus formation, bone destruction, and joint 
ankylosis, accompanied by a significant improvement in a composite clinical score that 
included joint swelling and pain [ 96]. JBT-101 also inhibited the development of serositis 
induce
d by toll-like receptor activation of cells within the mouse peritoneal cavity [ 98]. 
1.3 Summary of Pre-Clinical and Clinical Studies 
See the IB for JBT-101 for details of design and findings in non-clinical and previous clinical 
studi
es. Certain information relevant to safety and trial design is summarized below. 
 An
imal and Human Biomaterials Safety Data 1.3.1
A n
onclinical safety program was designed to support the development of JBT-101 and 
consi
sted of safety pharmacology, general toxicology, reproductive and developmental, and 
genotoxicity studies conducted with JBT-101. 
Safety pharm
acology and general toxicology studies up to 6 and 9 months’ duration in rats 
and dogs identified central nervous system/neurobehavioral effects in rats and/or dogs. JBT-
101-related convulsions were observed in rat and dog studies, but this adverse finding was 
considered to be related to procedures during animal handling and dosing, and the JBT -101 
systemic exposure by C max at No-Observed Adverse Effect Levels in these studies were 
determined to be ≥5× in rats and ≥1.7× in dogs related to clinical exposure at a human dose

 of 20 mg (b.i.d.) JBT-101. Specifically, the lowest dose where seizures were observed in rats 
was 4 
mg/kg/day. The highest dose being used in this study is approximately 0.67 
mg/kg/day. In addition, JBT-101 did not have any effect on seizure threshold in animals. 
There were no other treatment-related clinical, macroscopic or microscopic findings 
indicating organ toxicity in any of the repeat dose studies. In the in vitro human ether a-go-go 
(hERG
) assay, the approximate half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC 50) value for 
inhibition of the potassium current by JBT-101 was 7 µM (2800 ng/mL), 5× higher than 
cl
inical C max exposure value at a human dose of 20 mg (b.i.d.) JBT-101. In addition, there 
were no a
dverse cardiovascular effects occurred in vivo in anaesthetized dogs, or on 
cardiovascular parameters in dogs after repeat administration of JBT-101 up to 10 mg/kg 
BID for 9 months.  In a physical dependence rat study, JBT-101 did not exhibit drug 
dependence lability. Furthermore, JBT-101 was not teratogenic in the rat embryofetal 
development study and a pilot rabbit embryofetal development study (i.e., Segment 2 
studies). In a reproductive and developmental rat study (i.e., Segment 1), JBT-101 had no 
eff
ect on male and female fertility. JBT-101 was not mutagenic or clastogenic in in vitro or 
in vivo genotoxicity studies. 
 Animal Toxicokinetic Results 1.3.2
Toxicokinetic results from the 2-week once a day (q.d.) dose studies in rats and dogs and the 
2-week and 13-week studies of the rat three times a day and dog b.i.d. studies demonstrated 
tha
t: 
 JBT-101  exposure increased in a linear fashion with increases in dose. 
 JBT-101  exposure was comparable in males and females in both species. 
 JBT -101  exposure was comparable after the first and 14th doses in the 2-week q.d. 
dose s
tudies, indicating an absence of accumulation or time-dependency to 
pharmacokinetic (PK) measurements. In the 13-week study in rats, no change in C max 
was observed between days 14 and 98 of treatment, whereas there was between a 10-
20% accumulation of JBT-101 based on AUC between days 14 and 91 of treatment. 
In t
he 13-week study in dogs, there was no change in C m ax observed between days 14 
and 91 and no c
hange in JBT-101 AUC levels was observed between days 14 and 98 
of
 treatment. 
 Animal Metabolism 1.3.3
Studies of metabolism in animals have shown that: 
 JBT -101  binds tightly to plasma proteins, with binding of ≥ 97% in rat, dog, and 
human plasma.  
 JBT -101  undergoes limited metabolism. The percent of unchanged JBT-101 
re
maining after a 2-hour incubation in vitro was 103%, 90%, 86%, and 83% for rat, 
dog, monkey, and human hepatocytes, respectively. 
Clinical Protocol: ALE09  Page 24 of 125 CONFIDENTIAL  
 
 
Version 4.0   05 October  2018 
  JBT-101  is not a substrate for cytochrome P450 and displayed no inhibition of 
CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4/5 at concentrations of up to 
50 µM. Because the half maximal inhibitory concentration values for JBT-101 were 
gre
ater than 50 µM for all P450 isozymes, there appears to be no cytochrome P450 
inhibition at pharmacological study product levels. 
 Clinical Studies 1.3.4
As of January 2017, 117 healthy volunteers and 19 subjects with neuropathic pain have 
received JBT-101 through participation in two Phase 1 clinical trials, three mechanism of 
act
ion studies, and one Phase 2 clinical trial in refractory neuropathic pain under different 
Inve
stigational New Drug Applications (INDs) and sponsors (no longer active), for 
indications/investigational purposes not being considered in this IND. Subjects received up to 
240 mg total daily dose and were dosed up to seven days in total, up to three times a day. 
Subjects were ages 18-77 years of age. Details of the study designs can be found in the IB for 
JBT-
101.  
As of
 April 2017, 42 subjects (27 JBT-101, 15 placebo) with diffuse cutaneous systemic 
scl
erosis (SSc) were enrolled in trial JBT101- SSc- 001 , and 36 of 38 subjects that completed 
double
 blind treatment enrolled in the one-year open-label extension.  Eighty-five subjects 
with c
ystic fibrosis (61 JBT-101, 24 placebo) were enrolled in trial JBT101- CF-001.  
Twenty-two subjects (~11 JBT-101, 11 placebo) with skin-predominant dermatomyositis are 
act
ively being enrolled in trial JBT-101- DM- 001 .  
All of the data used for analyses of the pharmacokinetic and metabolism studies and safety 
measures was derived from the completed Phase 1 (CT-3-01, CPL7075-001-01) and Phase 2 
studi
es (CPL7075/102/02/02/001.1, JBT101- SSc-001). 
Details of pharmacokinetic and metabolism findings in the completed Phase 1 and Phase 2 
clinical trials can be found in the IB for JBT-101. Key pharmacokinetics and metabolism 
findings i
nclude:  
 JBT-101  was rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. 
 Mea n C max values increased approximately proportional to the increase in dose for 
singl
e doses from 10 to 240 mg and multiple doses from 20 to 80 mg per day.  
 Mea n AUC 0-inf values also increased approximately proportional to the increase in 
dose for si
ngle doses from 10 to 240 mg. For multiple doses from 20 to 80 mg per 
day, AU
C0-24h values increased slightly greater than the increase in dose. The mean ± 
SD AUC 0
- INF for JBT-101  was 35,025 ± 5784 ng·hr/ml for 80 mg three times a day. 
 Subjects ≥ 65 years old had an average AUC 0-24h about 15% greater than that of the 
younger subjects. 
 The f raction absorbed, mean clearance divided by fraction absorbed, and volume of 
distribution tended to increase slightly with dose in multiple dose studies. 
 For multiple doses, T max occurred at around 3 hours. 
Clinical Protocol: ALE09  Page 25 of 125 CONFIDENTIAL  
 
 
Version 4.0   05 October  2018 
  The average half-life ranged from 3.7 to 5.6 hours for single doses. 
 There  were no effects of the fed state at 20 and 40 mg doses.  
 Foll owing JBT-101  administration at 20-40 mg b.i.d. for 7 days in humans, the only 
obser
vable plasma metabolite of JBT-101 was a glucuronide metabolite [ 10 3], which 
re
presented 9% of total JBT-101 present in the plasma. 
The safety findi
ngs in each completed individual clinical trial can be found in detail in the IB 
for JBT-101. In summary, key safety findings from the two Phase 1 trials (CT-3-01, 
CP
L7075-100-01) and two Phase 2 trials (CPL7075/02/01/001.1, JBT101- SSc- 001) are: 
 Maxi mum Tolerated Dose is 180 mg total daily dose 
 No deaths  and no serious, severe or unexpected AEs related to JBT-101 occurred in 
any 
of the studies  
 On e of 27 (3.7%) JBT-101-treated subjects in the SSc trial (JBT101 -SSc-001) 
withdrew due to  a TEAE of moderate dizziness . 
 Mild to moderate AEs consistent with CB1/CB2 agonists occurred at higher doses, 
especially > 150 mg/day total daily do se 
 In pooled safety data, TEAEs that occurred in ≥ 5% of 88 JBT-101-treated subjects 
who recei
ved doses within the estimated therapeutic range of ≤ 60 mg total daily dose 
were dizziness (n = 10, 11 % ), dry mouth (n = 5, 5.6%), arthralgias (n = 6, 6.8%), GI 
dist
urbances (n = 6, 6.8%)  and fatigue (n=9, 10.2%). Note that the majority of 
subj
ects with GI complaints (6/6), fatigue (8/9) and arthralgias (6/6) were in the SSc 
trial and all of these symptoms are common in SSc. 
 In pool ed safety data of all trials (n = 150 total) and all doses of JBT-101, which 
inc
luded 71 subjects who received JBT-101 at  doses higher than the estimated 
the
rapeutic range, TEAEs that were observed in two or more subjects ≥ 5% of the 
time included mild dizziness (21.3%), moderate dizziness (10%), mild somnolence 
(6%), mild nausea (12%), mild dry mouth (8%), and mild fatigue (5.3%) (Table 27 of 
the Investigator Brochure for JBT-101). These AEs were consistent with CB1/CB2 
agoni
st class effects and showed a dose-response. Most AEs occurr ed in the highest 
frequency i
n subjects who received ≥ 150 mg total daily dose of JBT-101. Adverse 
event
s that were reported in ≥ 5% of placebo-treated subjects were headache 
(5.7%).There were no AEs or laboratory abnormalities that indicated 
immunosuppression or an increase in rate of infection. 
 Changes from baseli ne in blood pressure (BP) and pulse rate (P) in subjects treated 
with JBT-101 were generally similar to those treated with placebo, although in 
multi
ple dosing studies in healthy volunteers, BP recordings that were considered 
intermittent hypotension occurred more frequently subjects ≥ 65 years of age than in 
subjects ≥ 18 and ≤ 45 years of age (4/6 versus 0/18, respectively). 
 No cli nically relevant changes in physical examination findings were observed. 
Clinical Protocol: ALE09  Page 26 of 125 CONFIDENTIAL  
 
 
Version 4.0   05 October  2018 
  No clinically relevant changes in electrocardiograms (ECGs) or QT/corrected QT 
interval (QTc) intervals were observed. In the multiple dosing studies, subjects ≥ 18 
and ≤ 45 years of age had no abnormal ECG findings and no differences in mean 
cha
nges in QTc intervals between subjects treated with JBT-101 versus placebo. In 
subj
ects who received high doses (≥ 180 mg total daily dose JBT-101) and were ≥ 65 
year
s of age, three of six subjects who received JBT-101 had prolongation of QTc 
int
ervals ≥ 30 msec from baseline on Day 1, with no prolongation exceeding 39 msec 
and no QTc exceeding 500 msec. The maximum QTc observed was 487 msec. None 
of these changes were considered clinically significant. The longest prolongation of 
QTc, as of July 2017, with JBT-101 has occurred in a healthy subject who received 
pla
cebo. 
 There  were no notable changes in hematology or chemistry values from baseline. 
Individual changes in liver and renal function tests were few and small in magnitude. 
No food or age effects were observed in the laboratory hematology and chemistry 
values. 
In formal testing, there was no psychoactivity, effect on mood, or effect on 
attention/cognition at doses up to 80 mg total daily dose. The efficacy findings in the 
com
pleted Phase 2 trials (CPL7075/02/01/001.1, JBT101- SSc- 001) as of July 2017 can be 
summarized as follows: 
o JBT -101  reduced neuropathic pain significantly compared to placebo [ 104] 
 In J BT101- SSc-001, evidence of efficacy was observed across multiple outcomes, 
including the Combined Response Index in diffuse cutaneous SSc, the modified 
Rodnan Skin Score, Physician Global Assessment, Patient Global Assessment, the 
Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index, a systemic sclerosis skin 
symptom questionnaire, and the 5D-Itch questionnaire 
 I n JBT101- SSc-001, multiple different glucuronide metabolites of JBT-101 were 
observed in the plasma at < 10% with one glucuronide metabolite present at >10% at 
al
l doses. An open-label extension to the JBT101- SSc-001 study is ongoing, with 36 
subj
ects enrolled as of July 2017. All subjects in the open-label extension receive 
JBT
-101 20 mg once or twice per day, for up to 12 months. As of July 2017, total 
dura
tion of double blind placebo controlled and open-label extension dosing with 
JBT-101 was median 234 days (range 28, 295 days). All 36 subjects had at least one 
open
-label extension visit ≥ 28 days post baseline.  Adverse events (AEs, n = 88) 
occurred in 28/36 (78%) subjects in the open-label extension.  Most AEs were mild 
(55/88, 62%) or moderate (30/88, 34%) in severity and unrelated to JBT-101 (75/88, 
85%).  The AEs that occurred in ≥ 10% of subjects (n, % of subjects) were mild 
fatigue (5, 14%) and mild/moderate upper respiratory tract infection (4, 11%). 
 
Study JBT101- CF-001 is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised Phase 2 study 
conducted at 21 centres in the US and Europe. JBT-101 was administered at 1 mg once per 
day 
or 5 mg once per day for 28 days, escalating to 20 mg once per day or 20 mg twice per 
Clinical Protocol: ALE09  Page 27 of 125 CONFIDENTIAL  
 
 
Version 4.0   05 October  2018 
 day for an additional 56 days in subjects with cystic fibrosis. Eight-five subjects were dosed 
with study medication, the last subject has completed the trial, and it is estimated that 
~61 subjects received JBT- 101 and ~24 subjects received placebo throughout the trial . 
Safety data is summarized as follows: 
• The m ajority of spontaneously reported adverse events were mild to moderate in 
JBT-101 treated subjects.  The most frequent adverse event reported during JBT-
101 treatment was mild dry mouth.  
• Four of 61 (6.6%) of JBT-101 subjects withdrew following a TEAE, of which two 
were considered related to JBT-101 including mild lack of cognitive clarity, and a 
moderate feeling unmotivated. One of 24 (4.2%) of the placebo subjects withdrew 
following mild difficulty focusing, mild lack of cognitive clarity  
• T riplet ECGs with QT/QTc interval measurements were done throughout the trial 
and showed no significant changes from baseline and similar findings in subjects 
who received JBT-101 and placebo. 
• Ov erall, changes from baseline in the ARCI-M were similar in subjects who 
received JBT-101 and placebo. 
JBT- 101-treated subjects exhibited clear reductions in inflammatory biomarkers in the 
sputum including total cells, neutrophils, eosinophils, macrophages, lymphocytes, 
interleukin-8, neutrophil elastase, and IgG in sputum.  The number of new pulmonary 
exacerbations (commencement of new systemic antibiotic) per individual per 12 weeks 
(event rate) was 0.28 for JBT- 101 vs. 0.60 for placebo (54% reduction).  The event rate per 
1
2 weeks of new pulmonar y exacerbations treated with IV antibiotics was 0.09 for JBT- 101 
(all doses combined) vs. 0.26 for placebo (65% reduction) and was lowest with JBT-101 20 
mg b.i.d. (80% reduction).No unexpected SAEs were reported; most SAEs are acute 
infect
ious pulmonary exacerbation of cystic fibrosis. 
Study JBT101- DM-001 is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised Phase 2 study 
being conducted at one centre in the US. JBT-101 or placebo is administered at 20 mg 
once
 per day for 28 days, escalating to 20 mg twice per day for an additional 56 days in 
s
ubjects with skin-predominant dermatomyositis . A s of July 2017 , 22 subjects have been 
d
osed with study product, and it is estimated that ~11 subjects received JBT- 101 and ~ 11 
subjects have received placebo. Safety data are summarized as follows: 
• The st udy has not completed enrolment and remains blinded. 
• Foll owing their review of blinded safety data, a Safety Monitoring Committee 
recommended no change to the protocol or safety monitoring plan. 
• There have been no serious, severe, or unexpected AEs. Most AEs have been mild 
in severity. 
An open label extension of the study has started and as of July 2017, 11 patients have 
enr
olled.

1.5 Know
n and Potential Risks and Benefits of JBT-101  
 Potential Risks 1.5.1
Expected AEs in clinical studies with JBT-101 include those related to active SLE, JBT-101, 
and comm
on events in the general population. Expected AEs related to active SLE include 
any new or worsening signs and symptoms of mucocutaneous disease, serositis, 
musculoskeletal disease, peripheral or central nervous system disease, renal disease (and 
accompanying systemic hypertension and reduction in renal function), hematologic 
cytopenias (autoimmune hemolytic anemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia), depression and 
anxiety and/or signs of constitutional disease such as lymphadenopathy, fever and weigh t 
loss. Other expected AEs related to active SLE also include mild to severe infections related 
either to disease or immunosuppressive medications, medically significant elevations in acute 
phase reactants such as total globulins, CRP, sedimentation rate, and anti-dsDNA or other 
antibody levels, medically significant reductions in complement levels, and mild normocytic 
anemia. Additional anticipated risks of JBT-101 specific to SLE patients would include 
worseni
ng xerostomia in patients with dry mouth from associated sicca syndrome. Many 
patients with SLE also demonstrate cognitive impairment and/or depression that may worsen 
or become apparent during a disease flare. 
Expected AEs related to JBT-101 are via CB receptors. CB1/CB2 agonists can produce AEs 
in h
umans, and many of these may be caused by the activation of central CB1 rather than of 
CB2 or peripheral CB1. Adverse effects most often observed, at least in other published 
clinical trials, have been dizziness/light-headedness, dry mouth, tiredness/fatigue, muscle 
weakness, myalgia (muscle pain) and palpitations [ 105]. Other less frequently reported side 
eff
ects of CB1/CB2 agonists include disorientation, feeling of drunkenness, ‘high sensation’, 
mental clouding and/or altered time perception, impairment of memory or ability to 
concentrate, tremor, balance impairment or lack of coordination, nausea/feeling sick, 
vomiting, hypotension, blurred vision, constipation or diarrhea, confusion, 
dysphoria/depression, disorientation, paranoia and hallucinations [ 105]. Any of these AEs 
potentially could be seen with JBT-101 exposure. 
As of
 July 2017, a number of the AEs associated with CB1/CB2 agonists have been reported 
in sub
jects exposed to JBT-101  and future subjects are at risk for these same AEs. As seen in 
pooled safety data from the 2 Phase 1 studies and 2 Phase 2 completed clinical trials, AEs 
that occurred in ≥ 5% of JBT-101 treated subjects were fatigue, dry mouth, arthralgias, 
dizziness, nausea and vomiting.  Many of the other AEs listed as class effects of CB1/CB2 
agoni
sts have been reported by JBT-101-treated subjects, albeit at frequencies lower than 5% 
as of July 2017
 (see Tables 17, 18 and 20 in the Investigator Brochure for JBT-101 ). JBT-
101 is a full agonist of CB2, with little evidence of psychotropic activity at likely therapeutic 
doses, because of limited ability to cross the blood-brain barrier and reduced affinity for 
Clinical Protocol: ALE09  Page 29 of 125 CONFIDENTIAL  
 
 
Version 4.0   05 October  2018 
 CB1. Psychotropic activity of JBT-101 will be tested formally with the ARCI- M 
quest
ionnaire [ 106]. 
Prol
ongations of QTc interval to less than 500 msec total and up to 39 msec prolongation 
from pre-treatment baseline were observed in a previous Phase 1 study, and all of these 
prol
ongations were judged not clinically significant. They were observed in some subjects ≥ 
65 years of age exposed to JBT-101 at a total daily dose greater than or equal to 180 mg for 
seve
n days. The QTc changes were also observed on ECGs not done using standard 
techniques to measure QT/QTc intervals. For this reason, to ensure safety of subjects, the 
QT/QTc interval will be measured at time points before, during and after treatment, and 
maximum doses of JBT-101 to be tested in this study will not exceed 40 mg/day (given as 20 
mg 
b.i.d. ). In the JBT101- SSc- 001 study, assessment of ECGs and corrected QT intervals 
using standard techniques revealed no clinically significant prolongation of corrected QT 
intervals or other significant electrocardiogram findings.  
Studies of human reproduction have not been performed with JBT-101. It is not known if 
JBT-
101 can cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women or if it can negatively 
aff
ect reproductive capacity. Women of childbearing potential should avoid becoming 
pregnant and should not be breastfeeding at the start of the study, during the study, and for 28 
days after the last dose of study drug. 
Expected AEs in a general population include events such as mild changes in vital signs, sore 
throats, mild skin, upper or lower respiratory tract, or genitourinary infections requiring 
topical or oral antibiotics, asymptomatic bacteriuria, headaches, nausea, mild rashes, and 
minor accidents. Mild abnormalities in laboratory testing of CBC testing, platelets, 
differential cell counts, metabolic panels including liver function tests and electrolytes, and 
urinalyses are expected to occur in a general population. 
Abrupt discontinuation of treatment with JBT-101 has not been shown to cause any harmful 
eff
ects in previous studies; therefore, study product may be stopped without tapering or 
addi
ng additional treatments. If a subject has received clinical benefit from JBT-101, then 
his/
her disease activity may or may not worsen after discontinuation of JBT-101. To reduce 
thi
s risk of disease flare, subjects will continue their standard-of-care medication throughout 
the study and during the follow-up period. Subjects will have follow-up safety evaluation and 
testing of disease activity 28 ± 3 days after the end of the planned active treatment period or 
after withdrawal or discontinuation of study product. 
Subjects will be instructed to call the site investigator or treating physician if they experience 
an AE (whether or not they determine it to be related to the study) and may be evaluated for 
potential toxicity at an unscheduled visit.

  Potential Benefits 1.5.2
No physical, psychological, social, legal, or any other benefits are claimed for individual 
SLE subjects who chose to participate in this study. Based on biologic effects of JBT-101 
and ot
her preferential CB2 agonists in in vitro  and in v ivo  models of inflammation and 
var
ious diseases, it is reasonable to test JBT-101 for evidence of efficacy in SLE in this 
study
. The information that will come from this study will address effects of JBT-101 on 
effic
acy, safety, tolerability, and biomarkers of inflammation in SLE subjects. This 
information will be used in decision making about whether to progress JBT-101 to future 
pivot
al clinical studies, as a step toward approval by regulatory agencies for treatment of 
SLE.  
1.6 Rationale for the Study 
There remains significant unmet medical need for the treatment of active musculoskeletal 
disease in SLE that is refractory to treatment with NSAIDS and anti-malarial agents and 
necessitates the addition of corticosteroids, immunosuppressive medications and/or narcotic 
analgesia. A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled design will be used to reduce bias 
in a
ssessment of safety, tolerability, and efficacy of JBT-101 in SLE subjects with active 
musculoske
letal disease.  JBT-101 and placebo will be administered in addition to current 
sta
ndard of care that the subject is receiving, to reduce risk of precipitating disease flares by 
stopping standard-of-care treatments.  There is limited metabolism of JBT-101, and JBT-101 
has no i
mpact on multiple cytochrome P450 systems, an observation that reduces the 
likelihood of adverse drug-drug actions in SLE patients on complex treatment programs. 
The hypothesis is that JBT-101 will provide clinical efficacy in SLE patients with at least 
moderat
e musculoskeletal disease activity by activation of pathways that resolve ongoing, 
adverse immune responses and inhibit inflammatory cytokine production associated with 
SLE. JBT-101 is expected to decrease production of pro-inflammatory cytokines implicated 
in t
he pathogenesis of SLE, such as IFNα, IL-6, and IL-1β. Further, JBT-101 is expected to 
act
ivate apoptosis in activated immune cells and induce clearance of apoptotic cells 
(efferocytosis) and cellular debris by non-inflammatory macrophages. Through these 
mechanisms, JBT-101  is expected to provide efficacy in active musculoskeletal inflammation 
in SLE, without immunosuppression. 
For the primary efficacy analysis, inflammatory pain will be measured daily using the 
m
aximum pain numerical rating scale (NRS), and longitudinal changes will be evaluated 
after 12 weeks (end of treatment). Other efficacy outcomes include categorical change in 
pain (improvement, no change, worsening), the number (%) of subjects achieving a 30% (or 
50%
, 75% or 100%) reduction in maximum pain from baseline to end of treatment, and SLE 
disease activity measures, including number of tender and swollen joints on 66/68 joint 
count
, presence versus absence of arthritis by Safety of Estrogen in Lupus: National 
Assessment (SELENA) SLEDAI and score in the musculoskeletal domain of the British Isles 
Lupus Acti
vity Group (BILAG) 2004, the SLE Responder Index and its domains (SELENA 
SLEDAI assessment, BILAG 2004 assessment, and Physician’s Global Assessment), and 
disease flares. Efficacy also will be assessed with patient-reported outcomes [Lupus Activity 
Patient Global Assessment and Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information 
Clinical Protocol: ALE09  Page 31 of 125 CONFIDENTIAL  
 
 
Version 4.0   05 October  2018 
 System (PROMIS)-29  Short Form, PROMIS Item Bank v2.0 - Cognitive Function test, and 
Trea
tment Satisfaction Survey]. Changes from baseline in secondary efficacy outcomes are 
expected to occur and be in the direction of improvement, although the changes are not 
expected to reach statistical significance at p < 0.05 after 84 days exposure in this first trial in 
re
latively small numbers of SLE patients. In contrast, changes in the metabolipidomic profile 
and stimulated whole blood cytokine expression are expected within days, and changes in 
biom
arkers of inflammation, such as C-reactive protein (CRP) and type I IFN gene 
expression, are expected to happen within a few weeks.  
Safety assessments include patient-reported AEs, vital signs, physical examinations, 
complete blood count (CBC) with cell differential, metabolic panel, urinalysis, and 12-lead 
ECGs for QT/QTc intervals. Blood for JBT-101  concentrations and metabolites, biomarkers 
of inflammation, metabolipidomic profiles, cytokine expression in serum and stimulated 
whole blood, and analysis of type 1 IFN gene expression will also be collected. Confirmation 
of
 the lack of psychotropic properties of oral JBT-101 will be done using the Addiction 
Resear
ch Center Inventory-Marijuana (ARCI-M) questionnaire. 
The mechanism of action of J BT-101 will be evaluated by measuring metabolipidomic 
profil
es, to determine whether JBT-101 increases SPMs, especially lipoxin A4, and anti-
inflamm
atory eicosanoids, both in absolute amounts and relative to pro-inflammatory 
eicosanoid mediators. The downstream consequences of this activity on biologic pathways 
relevant to disease pathology in SLE will be tested, looking for decreased expression of 
cytokines and gene transcripts that are elevated during inflammation in SLE. 
This is a first- in-SLE study of J BT- 101. The data from this study will provide information on 
whether the benefit: risk profile in SLE supports further clinical development and 
progression to future pivotal clinical testing. The data will support selection of optimal dose 
and dose regimen of JBT-101 in future SLE studies. 
 Rationale
 for the Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria 1.6.1
The target population is adults with SLE who have active musculoskeletal disease (arthritis 
or tendonitis) with significant inflammatory pain, despite treatment with an anti-malarial 
drug unless intolerant of an anti-malarial drug, and who are on stable doses of prednisone ≤ 
10 mg daily or equivalent for at least 14 days prior to dosing with study product. To reduce 
ri
sk to subjects in this first- in-SLE study, subjects will be excluded who have severe organ 
damage, severe disease activity and/or require > 10 mg day oral prednisone or equivalent for 
treatment.  Additionally, patients with a recent or current history of substance abuse or those 
with c
hronic pain requiring narcotic analgesia will be excluded in order to limit confounding 
effects of these substances on our endpoints. Subjects will be > 18 and ≤ 70 years of age at 
the time of signing the Informed Consent Form. Adults are selected as the target population, 
beca
use neither toxicology studies in juvenile animals nor safety or efficacy assessments in 
children with SLE have been done yet. 
Subjects with fibromyalgia are not excluded from the study. Given that up to about one-third 
of SLE patients have concomitant fibromyalgia, exclusion of SLE subjects with fibromyalgia 
Clinical Protocol: ALE09  Page 32 of 125 CONFIDENTIAL  
 
 
Version 4.0   05 October  2018 
 from this study is impractical and would delay and jeopardize completion of study 
enrollment.  Multiple steps have been included in the trial design to account for the potential 
impact of pain from fibromyalgia on study results.  To ensure that a significant component of 
the subjects daily pain NRS score is from inflammatory pain from joint/tendon involvements, 
subjects will be required to have arthritis and/or tendonitis on SELENA SLEDAI assessment 
or B score in the musculoskeletal domain of the BILAG 2004 assessment.  The presence or 
absence of fibromyalgia and its severity will be assessed using the Fibromyalgia Symptom 
Score [ 107].  The absence versus presence of fibromyalgia (Fibromyalgia Symptom Score < 
13 versus ≥ 13 at Screening) will be used as a stratification variable at randomization and in 
subse
t analyses of the efficacy outcomes. 
 Rationale for the Treatment Arm 1.6.2
The JBT-101 doses selected for this study are within the range of doses that were well 
tolerated in previous Phase 1 and 2 studies and in a recently completed clinical trial in SSc, 
al
l sponsored by Corbus Pharmaceuticals Holdings, Inc.  The JBT-101 oral doses selected 
for this study are 5 mg b.i.d., 20 mg q.d., and 20 mg b.i.d. Parallel dose assignment to 
JBT-101 in doses up to 20 mg b.i.d. is supported by a previous multiple ascending dose study 
and a Phase 2 study in humans in which JBT-101 doses up to 40 mg b.i.d. showed acceptable 
safety pr
ofiles and were well-tolerated.  In a recently completed study of JBT- 101 in 
systemic sclerosis and ongoing studies in dermatomyositis and cystic fibrosis 
(sponsored by Corbus) using similar doses to those proposed in this clinical trial (5 
mg-40 mg daily), JBT-101 has been well tolerated with no severe AEs attributable to 
JBT-101. Each  dose is expected have an acceptable safety profile, be well-tolerated, and 
provide clinical benefit, based on previous animal or human testing and the nature of the 
inflammatory components of SLE. Based on preclinical data and early higher dose clinical 
data, it is expected that any safety risk and clinical efficacy of JBT-101 in humans will be 
related to exposure. Based on extrapolation from animal models of inflammation, 5 mg q.d. 
was estimated to be about the median dose required for efficacy in humans. However, 
information from the cystic fibrosis study and from a cutaneous model of E. coli- induced 
inflammation [101] suggests that 5 mg b.i.d. may be more effective than the 5 mg q.d. dose:  
 The 5 m g q.d. dose has some but more limited effects than 20 mg b.i.d. on biomarkers 
in the sputum in cystic fibrosis patients, with biologic effects of 20 mg b.i.d. ≥ 20 mg 
q.d. and > 5 mg q.d. doses  
 In a  human model of innate immune responses (E. coli- induced cutaneous 
inflamm
ation) the 5 mg b.i.d. dosing demonstrates the expected mechanism of action 
by enhanc
ing resolution of inflammation.  Some activities such as induction of 
Speci
alized Pro-resolving lipid Mediators are less with 5 mg b.i. d. than with 20 mg 
b.i.d. whereas other activities such as inhibition of neutrophil infiltration in the skin 
ar
e equal  
Since the 5 mg b.i.d. dose does not pose any safety issues, we plan to use 5 mg b.i.d. as the 
low dose arm
. The JBT-101  20 mg dose is expected to provide maximal or near maximal 
levels of clinical benefit, and the JBT-101 20 mg b.i.d. dose is expected to provide 
m
aximal/plateau levels of clinical benefit. Inclusion of the JBT-10 1 20 mg q.d. and 20 mg 
Clinical Protocol: ALE09  Page 33 of 125 CONFIDENTIAL  
 
 
Version 4.0   05 October  2018 
 b.i.d. doses is expected to maximize opportunity to detect clinical efficacy, safety signals, 
evidence of biologic activity, and effects on biomarkers in this study. Finally, the availability 
of data from three different doses of JBT-101 will facilitate the exploratory modeling of 
re
lationships between plasma concentrations of JBT-101 and efficacy outcomes, SAEs, 
biom
arkers of inflammation, and levels of certain SPMs. 
The 84 days duration of dosing is supported by findings in 13-week toxicology studies in 
rats and dogs. This study will provide data on safety, tolerability, plasma concentrations, 
and clinical efficacy of JBT-101 over a longer exposure than in a shorter study.  
In s
upport of oral administration q.d. or b.i.d. without regard to fed/fasted state, JBT-101 is 
well
 absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and exhibits dose proportional PK at the doses to 
be tested in this study.  Based on PK results in previous clinical trials, Tmax is expected to be 
between 2.7 to 3.5 hours for the 5 and 20 mg doses in the current trial, which supports the 
timing of 3 hours post dosing as an estimate of time of maximal plasma concentrations.  The 
average terminal chemical half-life of JBT-101 in subjects who received 10 mg or 20 mg q.d. 
in pr
evious studies ranges from 3.7 to 4.4 hours and the biologic effects of JBT-101 are 
longer
, which supports q.d. and b.i.d. testing.  Doses to be tested in this study have not shown 
a significant food effect in a prior clinical study, which supports dosing without regard to fed 
state. 
 Rationale for the Control Arm 1.6.3
Inclusion of a placebo cohort in this study is important to control for variations in disease 
activity and AEs that occur commonly in SLE as a result of their disease, co-morbid illness 
and/
or adverse effects of prescribed medications.  Because of the relatively short duration of 
the study and maintenance of the subject’s existing medications for musculoskeletal disease 
activity and pain, the inclusion of a placebo cohort does not impose undue risk on these 
subjects.  To limit risk of increasing disease activity in a placebo-controlled trial, patients 
with a BILAG A in any organ system at Screening or Visit 1 (Day 1) will be excluded, 
beca
use those individuals should receive a new treatment for that severely active organ 
system.  Subjects will be maintained on their SLE medications from Screening throughout 
Visit 6 (Day 113), to reduce a risk of disease flare precipitated by discontinuation of 
medications to meet entry criteria.  Stopping rules will limit the risk of AEs due to severe 
increases in disease activity. 
 Rationale for Mechanistic Studies 1.6.4
The rationale for the mechanistic studies is to validate the preclinical studies and investigate 
the in vivo  effects of JBT -101 on pathways that promote ongoing inflammatory responses 
and those that promote resolution of inflammation. Pre-clinical studies done in vitro  using 
heal
thy control and SLE PBMC and in animal models suggest that the drug’s anti-
inflammatory properties are mediated by inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as 
IL-1β, IL-6, IFNα and IFNγ and by increased production of prostaglandins and other 
bioactive lipids that facilitate the resolution of inflammation. All of these cytokines have 
been implicated in the pro-inflammatory milieu that is associated with SLE. Additionally, 
Clinical Protocol: ALE09  Page 34 of 125 CONFIDENTIAL  
 
 
Version 4.0   05 October  2018 
 although JBT-101  has not been demonstrated previously to have an effect on TNFα we plan 
to verify this in the planned mechanistic studies, which will be completed using stored 
spec
imens should the clinical results warrant further study. In addition to supplying more 
inform
ation that will enhance our understanding of the mechanism of action, it is possible 
that the mechanistic studies will identify a surrogate biomarker for response that is more 
sensitive and specific than currently accepted disease activity measures. This has significant 
potential importance for the design of a Phase III study.

 3 STUDY DESIGN 
3.1 Description of Study Design 
This study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center clinical trial to test 
the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of JBT-101 compared to placebo for the treatment of 
SLE
, to evaluate JBT-101’s impact on SPMs and biomarkers of inflammation in SLE, and to 
det
ermine JBT-101 plasma concentrations and metabolites in SLE subjects. The target 
popula
tion is SLE subjects ≥ 18 and ≤ 70 years of age with active musculoskeletal disease 
(arthritis and/or tendonitis) and 7-day average of maximal daily pain NRS score ≥ 4 of 10 (at 
least moderate pain) at Screening. If applicable, subjects must be on stable doses of 
corticosteroids ≤ 10 mg daily prednisone or equivalent prior to assessment of screening daily 
pain NRS score and non-increasing doses of other immunosuppressive medications for at 
least 3 months. Additionally, subjects must be on a stable dose of any anti-malarial drug for 
at least 3 months prior to screening or have a history of intolerance, contraindication, or 
unwillingness to take an anti-malarial drug.  
One hundred eligible subjects will be randomized in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to one of four cohorts to 
re
ceive assigned study treatment (see Table 1 below).  On Days 1-84, study product (JBT-
101
 or matching placebo) will be self-administered orally b.i.d., with at least 8 hours between 
doses
 and without regard to fed state.  Randomized eligible subjects will take the 1st dose of 
study medication in the clinic at Visit 1 (Day 1) (See Section 5.3, Administration of Study 
Product ).

Written informed consent must be obtained prior to the subject undergoing any study-related 
procedure, including screening tests and washout periods for prohibited medications, when 
applicable. During the screening period, subjects will be evaluated by the site investigator or 
qual
ified designee to assess eligibility for randomization into the study. Screening will take 
place over multiple days. The subject must report maximum daily pain NRS scores for seven 
days foll
owing the initial visit in the clinic, to ascertain whether eligibility criteria are met 
with a 7-day average of maximum daily pain NRS score ≥ 4 of 10. 
Subjects will report maximum daily pain NRS scores using an  interactive voice-response e-
diary system (IVRS), which can be accessed by any phone that supports tone dialing . At the 
Screening visit, subjects will be registered and provided with credentials allowing access to 
the IVRS. Subjects will be instructed on how to record maximum daily pain NRS score, 
Clinical Protocol: ALE09  Page 36 of 125 CONFIDENTIAL  
 
 
Version 4.0   05 October  2018 
 including directions for recording scores at about the same time every day, preferably before 
bedtime. Subjects who are found to be eligible after the screening evaluation will return for 
Visi
t 1 (Day 1) within 42 days of the initial screening visit. Subject eligibility will be 
confirm
ed prior to randomization.  Randomized subjects will be instructed to continue to 
record their maximum daily pain NRS score through Visit 6 (Day 113).  
T
here will be six additional study visits; Visits 1-6 on Days 1, 15  ± 3, 29 ± 3, 57 ± 3, 85 ± 3 
and 113 ± 3, respectively. Treatment occurs from Visits 1-5 (Days 1-85), and Visit 6 (Day 
113)
 is a follow-up visit 28 ± 3 days after treatment ends. The 3 day window at Visits is 
inc
luded in case of holidays or unusual circumstances, and it is expected that most if not all 
visits will be on the targeted day.  Vital signs, AEs, prior/concomitant medications, and blood 
for
 laboratory safety tests will be evaluated at Visits 1-6 (Days 1-113).  On Visit 1 (Day 1), 
Visi
t 3 (Day 29), Visit 4 (Day 57), Visit 5 (Day 85) and Visit 6 (Day 113), subjects will also 
have a phy
sical exam, urinalysis, and other assessments for evaluation of disease status 
inc
luding patient reported outcomes. Psychoactivity of JBT-101 will be assessed using the 
ARCI -
M questionnaire at Visit 1 (Day 1), Visit 3 (Day 29) and Visit 5 (Day 85).  Twelve-
le
ad ECGs and QT/QTc intervals will be assessed at Screening and at Visit 1 (Day 1) and 
Visit 5 (Day 85).  At Visit 1 (Day 1) , the  ARCI -M questionnaire and QT/QTc intervals will 
be assessed both before and 2.5 to 3.5 hours after the first dose of JBT-101, when plasma 
conce
ntrations of JBT-101 should be about maximal. Study personnel will record the 
subj
ect’s interval medical history, assess AEs and medication use, and collect samples for 
safety, pharmacokinetic, and mechanistic assessments (see Flow Diagram of Protocol  and 
Section 6, Assessments of Safety and Efficacy ; Ta ble 3, Schedule of Events for the specific 
ass
essment schedule). Subjects will return study drug bottles for a pill count, and new bottles 
will be dispensed, as appropriate.  
For therapeutic stability, subjects should remain on their current treatment regimen for SLE 
from Screening through Visit 6 (Day 113), unless the site investigator or other treating 
physician judges that a change in therapy is needed to provide best medical care for the 
subj
ect. If a subject experiences an increase in disease activity of SLE during participation in 
the study, he/she should be treated with standard of care for that increase in activity.  If 
medically appropriate, some drugs that would interfere with evaluation of efficacy should be 
withheld for specified durations prior to certain study visits.  See Section 5.6, Prohibited 
Me
dications  for details.  
Conco
mitant therapies taken for the long term treatment of pre-existing conditions other than 
SLE may be continued during the study provided they are in accordance with the exclusion 
criteria (Section 4.2, Exclusion Criteria ). It is preferred that these medications be stabilized 
before entry and continued wherever practical without variation of dose or regimen during 
the study.  Concomitant medications and new medications should be administered at the 
disc
retion of the site investigator or treating physician in order to provide the subject with the 
best possible medical care. Because of the unavailability of toxicology data or clinical 
experience of JBT-101 in combination with many therapeutic agents, it is recommended that 
change
s in ongoing treatments or introduction of new therapies are kept to a minimum. The 
benefit: risk to the subject should be carefully assessed and consideration given to the timing 
of any necessary introductions of new medications. 
Clinical Protocol: ALE09  Page 37 of 125 CONFIDENTIAL  
 
 
Version 4.0   05 October  2018 
 Because this is an early study and no efficacy has been demonstrated in SLE, there are no 
plans to provide the subject with open-label JBT-101 after the study period. If they so 
choose
, subjects may continue to be seen in the site investigator’s clinical practice. 
About 150 individuals will be screened to identify 100 eligible subjects, for a screen failure 
rate of about 33%. The number of subjects enrolled may be expanded by up to nine 
addi
tional subjects, if these additional eligible subjects have signed the Informed Consent 
Form and are actively engaged in the screening process at the time 100 subjects have been 
randomized into the study.  
About 15 sites in the United States will participate in this trial. The target enrollment of 100 
e
ligible subjects will take place over about 24 months, for a recruitment rate of about 0.28 
subj
ects per site per month. The feasibility of this plan is judged acceptable, based on expert 
input from the Protocol Chairs and their collaborators. 
The planned total duration of an individual subject’s participation in the study is about 112 
Days (84 days treatment and 28 days follow-up), plus Screening, unless the subject 
withdraws prematurely. (See Section 5.8, Treatment Discontinuation and Subject 
Wi
thdrawal .) Once 80% of planned sites are activated, the entire study is expected to take 
24-30 months to complete. 
 Strat
ification, Randomization, and Blinding 3.1.1
Eligible subjects will be randomized in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to one of four cohorts: 5 mg JBT-101 
b.i.d.
, 20 mg JBT-101 q.d., 20 mg JBT-101 b.i.d., or placebo ( see  Section 3.1, Description of 
Study Design , Table 1).  Subjects will be stratified by 7-day average of maximum daily pain 
NRS score ≤ 6 versus > 6 and Fibromyalgia Symptom Scale Score < 13 versus ≥ 13 at 
Scre
ening.  
To maintain the study blind, JBT-101 and placebo capsules and their packaging will be 
ide
ntical. All subjects will receive b.i.d dosing to maintain blinding to treatment assignment. 
In general, clinical staff, including the investigators, will be blinded to the treatment 
assignments until completion of the study.  In addition, they will not have access to any 
mechanistic data, and mechanistic laboratory staff will not have access to any clinical results 
until completion of the study. The success of blinding will be formally tested using a 
Treatment Satisfaction Survey that asks each study subject and corresponding site 
investigator to guess the study group assignment for that subject at the end of active 
treatment and then comparing these responses to what would be expected by chance. 
Unblinding must be approved by the study Medical Monitor unless an immediate life 
threatening condition has developed and the Medical Monitor is not accessible.  The site 
investigator will notify the protocol chair(s) and the DAIT- Statistic al and Clinical 
Coordinating Center (SACCC) of the unblinding event on the next business day. The 
emergency unblinding will also be reported to the Data and Safety Monitoring Board 
(DSMB). 
Clinical Protocol: ALE09  Page 38 of 125 CONFIDENTIAL  
 
 
Version 4.0   05 October  2018 
 A full account of the event will be recorded, including the date and time of the unblinding, 
the reason for the decision to unblind, and the name of the individual who made the decision 
and the names of the Medical Monitor and others who were notified. The reasons for 
unblinding of a participant’s treatment will be included in the final study report. 
An individual’s treatment assignment will be unblinded if the subject experiences a suspected 
adverse reaction that is serious and unexpected (see Section 7.2.1,  Adverse Event and  
Sect
ion 7.2.1.1 Suspected Adverse Reaction  and Section 7.2.2, Unexpected Adverse Event ) or 
othe
r protocol-specific event(s) determined by DAIT/NIAID to warrant unblinding. 
 Subject Completion and Replacement 3.1.1.1
A subject is considered to have completed the study if he/she has completed Visit 6 (Day 
113). 
Rando
mized subjects who never initiate treatment may be withdrawn and will not count 
towar
ds the accrual of 100 eligible subjects.  
3.2 Description of Endpoints  
See Section 6, Assessment of Safety and Efficacy,  for detailed descriptions of endpoint 
m
easures, and Section 8, Statistical Considerations and Analytical Plan ,  for planned 
analyses. 
 Primary Efficacy Endpoint 3.2.1
The primary endpoint for evaluation of the primary objective will be improvement in 
m
aximum daily pain NRS scores in the treated groups relative to the control after 12 weeks 
of treatment.  Longitudinal trends over the course of the treatment period will be modeled 
and used to estimate differences between means at baseline and Day 84 for each treatment 
group. 
 Secondary Efficacy Endpoints 3.2.2
1. The 7-day average of maximum daily pain NRS scores prior to Visits 1, 3, 4, 5, and 6 
will
 be used to evaluate the number (%) of subjects with: 
 Changes i n pain categories from Visit 1 (Day 1)  to Visits 3 (Day 29), 4 (Day 
57), 5 (Day 
85) and 6 (Day 113) (See Section 6.2.2.2 Pain Categories ) 
 Im provement of 30% from Visit 1 (Day 1)  to Visits 3 (Day 29), 4 (Day 57), 5 
(Day 85) and 6 (Day 113) 
 Improvement of 50% from Visit 1 (Day 1)  to Visits 3 (Day 29), 4 (Day 57), 5 
(Day 85) and 6 (Day 113)   
 Im provement of 75% from Visit 1 (Day 1)  to Visits 3 (Day 29), 4 (Day 57), 5 
(Day 85) and 6 (Day 113)

2. Trends i n active musculoskeletal disease activity over the duration of the treatment 
period (i.e. Visit 1 (Day 1) through Visit 5 (Day 85)) will be evaluated longitudinally 
using multiple indices: 
 Physic ian assessed tender joint count

4 SELEC
TION OF SUBJECTS 
The target population is adults with SLE who have active musculoskeletal disease (arthritis 
or tendonitis) with significant inflammatory pain, despite treatment with an anti-malarial 
drug unless intolerant of an anti-malarial drug, and who are on stable doses of prednisone ≤ 
10 mg daily or equivalent for at least 14 days prior to assessment of 7-day average of 
maximum daily pain NRS score at Screening and 42 days prior to Visit 1 (Day 1). 
W
omen and minorities will be recruited. Based on the demographics of this disease and the 
sites that will be used, it is anticipated that approximately 90% of the study population will 
be women and 60-75% will be African American and Hispanic or Asian. Urban sites will be 
included, to increase opportunities to enroll minority subjects. Pregnant and lactating women 
will be excluded from the study because of the unknown effects of JBT-101 on the fetus. 
Subjec
ts < 18 years of age will be excluded, because there are no toxicology studies in 
juve
nile animals and no safety, tolerability, and efficacy data in adults with SLE.

4.3 Co-enrollment Guidelines 
Enrolled subjects are allowed to continue participation in observational research studies that 
do not dictate treatment. Co-enrollment in another research study that dictates treatment in 
any way is not allowed from Screening through Visit 6 (Day 113).  
4.4 Strat
egies for Recruitment and Retention 
The target enrollment is 100 eligible subjects. Most subjects will be recruited from 
specialized academic outpatient SLE clinics run by the site investigators or at which the site 
investigators participate. A need to advertise for subjects outside the sites is not anticipated, 
although it is acceptable. If it becomes necessary to advertise, DAIT/NIAID will review and 
appr
ove such advertisements to make sure they meet FDA requirements. Children, pregnant 
females, prisoners and other vulnerable populations will not be recruited. The clinical trial 
will be listed on clinicaltrials.gov and possibly other relevant websites to make information 
about this trial easily accessible on the internet. 
To encourage retention in the study, every effort will be made to be respectful of the 
subject’s time. The total time required from the subject will vary with the visit and the 
efficiency of each site and is expected to be 11-15 hours across all visits plus travel time. 
Absent any saf
ety reason to withdraw from the study, subjects will be encouraged to stay in 
Clinical Protocol: ALE09  Page 45 of 125 CONFIDENTIAL  
 
 
Version 4.0   05 October  2018 
 the study at each visit by study personnel and reminded of the date and time of their next 
visit.  
5 TREATMENT OF SUBJECTS 
5.1 Description of Study Product 
 Product Description  5.1.1
Active Product: JBT-101 is (6aR, 10aR)-3-(1,1-dimethylheptyl)-  8-tetrahydro-cannabinol-
9-carboxylic acid (see Figure 2 ), also known as Lenabasum, anabasum, resunab, ajulemi c 
aci
d, CT-3, IP751 and CPL7075. It is a dimethylheptyl structural analogue of 
tetrahydroca
nnabinol-11-oic acid, designed and selected on the basis of cannabinoid 
structure-activity features associated with limited penetration of the blood-brain barrier, to 
reduce unwanted psychoactivity.  JBT-101 has preferential binding to CB2 versus CB1 and 
exhi
bits preferential cellular activation through CB2 (Tepper et al., 2014). Detailed study 
product information can be found in the IB for JBT-101. The structure of JBT-101 is shown 
in Figur
e 2. 
 
Figure 2. Structure of JBT-101 
Mol
ecular Formula:  C 25H36O4 
Molecular Weight:     400.55 
CAS Number:          137945-48-3 
Appeara
nce:             White to tan powder 
 
JBT-101 is manufactured by Corbus Pharmaceuticals Holdings, Inc.   
Comparator Product:  Placebo is microcrystalline cellulose (no active ingredient), 
formulated to have an appearance and weight similar to JBT-101 . 
 Packaging and Labeling of Study Product 5.1.2
JBT-101 5 mg and 20 mg and placebo are powder- in- capsule preparations packaged in 
identical no. 2 gelatin capsules. JBT-101  and placebo will be packaged in coded bottles of 35 
capsules each that will be labeled in accordance with regulatory requirements. The bottles 
will be made of high density polyethylene with polypropylene child-resistant caps and an 
induction seal. Each bottle will contain a canister that absorbs oxygen.   
Study pr
oduct will be supplied in kits of two bottles per kit. Each bottle will be numbered to 
match the kit.   Each kit will contain a 28-day supply of study product plus packaged overage 

Clinical Protocol: ALE09  Page 46 of 125 CONFIDENTIAL  
 
 
Version 4.0   05 October  2018 
 that is enough for another seven days of treatment, in case the next visit is delayed. In each 
kit, one bottle will be labeled for the morning dose and the other bottle will be labeled for 
evening dose, with written directions for morning or evening dosing and with visual clues 
about the time of dosing. Different kits will be manufactured to meet the needs of the study 
and will contain one of the following: 
 Cohort 1  Kit: One bottle of JBT-101 5 mg for a.m. dose and one bottle of 5 mg for 
p.m. dose 
 Cohort 2  Kit: One bottle of JBT-101 20 mg for a.m. dose and one bottle of placebo 
for p.
m. dose 
 Cohort 3 Kit: One bottle of JBT-101  20 mg for a.m. dose and one bottle of JBT-101 
20 
mg for p.m. dose 
 Cohort 4 Kit: One bottle of placebo for a.m. dose and one bottle of placebo for p.m. 
dose
 
The bottles will be indistinguishable from each other in appearance, and the kits will be 
indistinguishable from each other in appearance. 
JBT-101 will be dispensed to study subjects in the original packaging with a label clearly 
indi
cating that the contents are for investigational purposes only. The label will include 
conditions for storage, a unique drug ID, and other pertinent information such as Sponsor and 
caut
ion statement. Neither JBT-101 nor placebo should be used after the expiration date 
unle
ss a written notification of an expiration date extension is provided by the manufacturer. 
If the packaging is damaged, or if there is anything unusual about the appearance or attributes 
of the pills or bottles, it should not be used. The study drug in question should be quarantined 
at the study site and the problem immediately reported to DAIT/NIAID or their 
representative.  
 Storage
 and Handling of Study Product 5.1.3
DAIT, NIAID will provide the investigational product for the conduct of this protocol and 
will
 be responsible for the disposal of unused product. 
The investigational product will be stored at the site pharmacy or in the site investigator’s 
loc
ked storage cabinet/safe.  Study product will to be stored at room temperature away from 
temperature and humidity extremes. Storage conditions must be appropriate for small 
quantities of Controlled Drugs Act Schedule 1 substances. The study product that is returned 
by the subjects to the site also will be stored under conditions appropriate for small quantities 
of Controlled Drugs Act Schedule 1, until disposal. 
The site pharmacist, site investigator or qualified designee is responsible for investigational 
product accountability, maintaining accurate logs of study product received, dispensed, 
re
turned or destroyed, and  ensuring the appropriate amount of study drug is kept on site and 
that it is used for research purposes only. He/she will perform drug accountability procedures 
Clinical Protocol: ALE09  Page 47 of 125 CONFIDENTIAL  
 
 
Version 4.0   05 October  2018 
 such as checking drug shipments against the shipping contents form, maintaining a log of the 
amount of study drug provided to individual subjects, and reconciling used and unused drug 
supply by subjects and the study unit.   
Upon completion of the study, any unused investigational product(s) at the study sites will be 
re
turned to the drug distributor, as requested by DAIT/NIAID. 
5.2 Dosage Regimen  
The JBT-101 doses selected for this study are 5 mg b.i.d., 20 mg q.d., and 20 mg b.i.d. for 
ora
l administration without regard for fed/fasted state. JBT-101 will be administered orally 
b.i.d. on Days 1-84, with at least 8 hours between doses. (See Section 3. 1, Description of 
Study Desi
gn; Table 1.)  
5.3 Ad
ministration of Study Product 
JBT-101 will be self-administered orally b.i.d., with at least 8 hours between doses and 
without
 regard to fed state.  See Section 3.1, Description of Study Design ; Table  1 for 
morning and
 evening dosing for the 4 cohorts.  The first dose of JBT-101 at Visit 1 (Day 1) 
will
 be taken in the clinic, and the subjects will be observed in the clinic for at least 30 
minutes after this dose or longer, until, in the opinion of the investigator, vital signs and 
clinical symptoms are acceptable for the subject to leave the clinic. After this observation 
per
iod, subjects must still be available for additional assessments 2.5 to 3.5 hours after 
administration of the study product. 
JBT-101 should be taken in the following way: 
 JBT -101  and placebo capsules should be swallowed whole, with liquid as helpful, and 
shoul
d not be broken, chewed or opened. Morning and evening doses should be at 
le
ast 8 hours apart. 
 If a dose of JBT-101 or placebo is missed, it should be taken as soon as possible on 
the
 same day, as long as the other dose that day can be timed to be at least 8 hours 
separate from the time of the missed dose. If it is missed for the entire day, it should 
not be made up. 
 Doses can be taken without regard to fed state.   
Subjec
ts who take more than the prescribed dose of JBT-101 or placebo should be instructed 
to se
ek emergency medical care, if needed, and to contact the study staff as soon as possible. 
5.4 Management Plan for Potential Risks 
As of July 2017, no severe AEs have been found to be definitely related to JBT-101. As 
such, t
he plans detailed in the section are proposed as general precautions for potential risks.   
Expected AEs related to JBT-101  are via CB receptors. As of July 2017, a number of the 
AEs associ
ated with CB1/CB2 agonists have been reported in subjects exposed to JBT-101, 
such a
s fatigue, dizziness, decreased concentration, feeling “weird”, lightheadedness, 
Clinical Protocol: ALE09  Page 48 of 125 CONFIDENTIAL  
 
 
Version 4.0   05 October  2018 
 asthenia, somnolence, nausea, vomiting, mild orthostatic hypotension, and dry mouth. 
Pati
ents in the study will be monitored closely for all of these side effects as well as for 
potential toxicities including psychotropic, gastrointestinal and cardiovascular effects. They 
are scheduled to be seen frequently during the treatment period (on study Days 1, 15, 29, 57 
and 85)
 and on day 113 for safety follow-up. The ARCI-M scale will be used to assess 
psychotropic effects of the drug. The Lupus Activity Patient Global Assessment, PROMIS-
29 Short Form and PROMIS Item Bank v2.0 - Cognitive Function will be used to assess 
fatigue a
nd quality of life. The IVRS e-diary for the NRS scale will be used to record pain on 
a dai
ly basis. Disease activity will be evaluated using patient history, physical exams, 
hem
atologic, blood chemistries, urinalyses and serologies pertinent to the SLEDAI (C3, C4 
and ant
i-dsDNA antibodies).  
Prolongations of QTc interval to less than 500 msec total and up to 39 msec prolongation 
from pre-treatment baseline were observed in a previous Phase 1 study, and all of these 
prol
ongations were judged not clinically significant.  They were only observed in some 
subjects ≥ 65 years of age exposed to JBT-101 at a total daily dose of up to 180 mg for seven 
days.  For this reason, to ensure safety of subjects, the QT/QTc interval will be measured 
thr
oughout the study, and maximum doses tested will not exceed 40 mg/day (given as 20 mg 
b.i.d.). 
If a subject develops a grade 3 or higher NCI-CTCAE (version 4.0) adverse event that is 
deemed by the blinded site investigator to be possibly related, probably related, or related to 
study
 drug, the subject will be discontinued from treatment but will continue to be monitored 
at
 the scheduled follow-up visits unless consent is withdrawn.  
There will be no dose modification in this study, other than temporary or permanent 
discontinuation of study drug and there is no rescue treatment. 
 Prevention of Potential Risks to Study Product 5.4.1
The Inclusion/Exclusion criteria have been designed to exclude subjects with significant 
other illnesses or conditions that would increase safety risks during the trial. Subjects with 
chr
onic pain requiring ongoing treatment with narcotic analgesia are also excluded. Subjects 
will additionally be reminded to call their study physician in the event that they develop any 
adverse event (whether or not they determine it to be related to the study) and may be 
evaluated for potential toxicity at an unscheduled visit. 
 Management of Potential Risks to Study Product 5.4.2
Severe symptoms related to the potential risks of JBT-101  may necessitate stopping study 
drug. Stopping study drug is not a reason for withdrawal from the study, but a subject may be 
withdrawn at the discretion of the PI if deemed it is in the subject’s best interest.  
For subj
ects who experience potential CB1/CB2 mediated AEs (fatigue, dizziness, decreased 
concentration, feeling “weird”, lightheadedness, asthenia, somnolence, GI disturbances such 
as na
usea or vomiting, or dry mouth), treatment for symptoms should be prescribed as 
needed, and study treatment may be withheld at discretion of PI.  
Clinical Protocol: ALE09  Page 49 of 125 CONFIDENTIAL  
 
 
Version 4.0   05 October  2018 
 5.5 Concurrent Medications and Therapy 
The intent is that each subject is maintained on all his/her medications for SLE from 
Screening through Visit 6 (Day 113), unless the site investigator or other treating physicians 
judge that a change in therapy is needed to provide best medical care for the subject.  
Information about the concomitant medications and treatments will be collected at each Visit.  
All concomitant medications given to the subject during the study will be recorded on the 
eCRF.  
Concomitant therapies taken for the long term treatment of pre-existing conditions other than 
SLE may be continued during the study provided they are in accordance with the exclusion 
criteria.  It is preferred that these medications be stabilized before entry and continued 
wherever practical without variation of dose or regimen during the study. 
During the study, concomitant medications and new medications should be administered at 
the discretion of the site investigator or treating physician in order to provide the subject with 
the best possible medical care.  Because of the unavailability of toxicology data or clinical 
experience of JBT-101 in combination with many therapeutic agents, it is recommended that 
change
s in ongoing treatments or introduction of new therapies are kept to a minimum.  The 
benefit: risk to the subject should be carefully assessed and consideration given to the timing 
of any necessary introductions of new medications. 
Permitted concomitant medications for SLE during the study include stable doses, including 
stable doses of as needed (prn) medication, of any of the following: 
 Anti -malarial medications 
 Syste mic corticosteroids ≤ 10 mg q.d. or ≤ 20 mg every other day oral prednisone or 
equi
valent corticosteroid 
 Met hotrexate, mycophenolate, azathioprine, leflunomide, belimumab,  cyclosporine, 
or tacrolimus 
 Topical  therapies, such as topical corticosteroids, antibiotics, anti-viral agents, 
artificial tears, ophthalmic ointments 
 NSAIDS, dosing must be held within 12 hours of certain study Visits (see Table 2 
below) 
 Non-narcotic and narcotic analgesic, dosing of must be held within 6 or 12 hours, 
based on half-life of the analgesic, of certain study Visits (see Table 2). Narcotic 
anal
gesics are permitted only for prn use for acute events not related to SLE disease 
activity 
 Other  medications not specifically included in this list of allowed concomitant 
medications for SLE are allowable, based on the judgment of the investigator and 
provided they are not included in the list of disallowed medications (Table 2)

5.7 Procedures for Monitoring Subject Compliance 
The number of capsules of study product returned to the site will be counted and recorded on 
Visits 2 (Day 15), 3 (Day 29), 4 (Day 57), and 5 (Day 85). Note that at Visit 2, the study drug 
caps
ules will be counted to evaluate compliance, but the bottles will be returned to the 
s
ubject for dosing until Visit 3. Drug Class  Requirements  
Analgesics with half -life < 6 hours  Prohibited for 6 hours  prior to study 
assessments at Visits 1, 3, 4, 5, and 6  
NSAIDS and analgesics with half -life ≥ 6 
hours  Prohibited for 12 hours  prior to study 
assessments at Visits 1, 3, 4, 5, and 6  
Systemic corticosteroids > 10 mg per day 
or > 20 mg every other day oral prednisone 
or equivalent corticosteroid or increase in 
dose of systemic corticosteroid  To accommodate the occasional use of extra 
corticosteroids by patients for reasons not 
associated with SLE flares, increases of up to 20 
mg/day that are decreased back to the baseline 
dose within 7 days are permitted, but not on 
more than 2 occasions during the study.  These 
short increases in dose may not be accompanied 
by a documented  SLE disease flare.  
However, use is p rohibited for 14 days  prior to 
study visits for Screening .  
 
 
Intraarticular, intravenous, or 
intramuscular s ystemic corticosteroids  Prohibited for 14 days  prior to study visits for 
Screening  and during the study

Version 4.0   05 October  2018 
 5.8 Treatment Discontinuation and Subject Withdrawal 
 Interruption of Dosing and Study Treatment Discontinuation  5.8.1
Interruption of continued dosing in individual subjects may occur for safety reasons and at 
the discretion of the site investigator, if it is felt that interruption of dosing is in the best 
interest of the subject. Other than in urgent situations, it is recommended that the site 
investigator discuss the reasons for interruption of dosing with the Protocol Chairs and 
D
AIT/NIAID prior to interruption.  Multiple on-off periods of treatment with study drug are 
per
mitted, as necessary in the judgment of the investigator for safety purposes.  
Study treatment will be discontinued permanently for any individual subject under the 
following conditi
ons: 
1. At any t ime during the study at the request of the subject or subject’s guardian 
2. If inves tigators or the DAIT/NIAID Medical Monitor determine(s) that the subject’s 
heal
th, safety, and/or well-being are threatened 
3. Study t reatment will be discontinued for any subject who experiences any of the 
following:  
 A severe flare by the SELENA SLEDAI Flare Index or a BILAG A in any 
domain except musculoskeletal  
 Star ting a medication that is prohibited during the study (See Table 2  in Section 
5.6, Prohibited Medications)  
 Inc reases in doses of methotrexate, mycophenolate, azathioprine, leflunomide, 
belimumab, cyclosporine, or tacrolimus above stable baseline doses  
 Any G rade 3 or higher AE or SAE that, in the opinion of the blinded site 
investigator, is  at least “possibly related” to study product  
 Pregna ncy. (See Section 7.6, Pregnancy Reporting ) 
Abrupt di
scontinuation of treatment with JBT-101 is not known to cause any harmful effects; 
the
refore, study product will be stopped without tapering or adding additional treatments. All 
remaining study product will be returned to the study staff.  
There will be no dose modification in this study, other than temporary or permanent 
discontinuation. 
 Procedures for Discontinuation of Protocol-Specified Treatment Requirements  5.8.1.1
Whenever possible, subjects who have been discontinued from study treatment should 
complete all scheduled study visits including all exams, procedures, assessments, and tests 
for the duration of the study. Furthermore, if discontinuation is due to safety concerns, 
subjects will be given appropriate care under medical supervision beyond the last scheduled 
study visit, if necessary, until the symptoms of any AE resolve or the subject’s condition 
becomes stable. If the site Principal Investigator ( PI) determines that completion of these 
visits is not clinically appropriate for the subject or if the subject or subject’s guardian elects 
Clinical Protocol: ALE09  Page 52 of 125 CONFIDENTIAL  
 
 
Version 4.0   05 October  2018 
 not to complete these visits, the subject will be withdrawn from the study per the guidelines 
in Section 5.8.2.1, Procedures for Subject Withdrawal from the Study .   
 Sub
ject Withdrawal from the Study 5.8.2
When a subject is withdrawn from the study, protocol-specified treatment requirements are 
discontinued, and study-related visits, exams, procedures, assessments, tests and data 
collection are terminated. Individual subjects will be withdrawn from the study under the 
following conditions: 
 The subj ect or subject’s guardian withdraws consent 
 If the s ubject elects to participate in any other sort of study or clinical trial (excluding 
observational registries or cohorts), the subject may be withdrawn at the discretion of 
the DAIT/NIAID 
 Subjec t non-compliance with treatment regimens or failure to keep appointments 
 Procedures for Subject Withdrawal from the Study 5.8.2.1
All withdrawn subjects will have a follow-up visit after study product is discontinued for 
final safety monitoring. The timing of the Early Withdrawal Visit in this study is 28 ± 3 days 
after study product is discontinued. Assessments will be the same for subjects who withdraw 
before completing all dosing and those who complete all dosing. Subjects who withdraw 
consent will be asked to complete the Early Withdrawal Visit; however, they will not be 
required to complete the visit.  
Subjects who are withdrawn due to pregnancy will be followed according to the procedures 
outlined in Section 6.1.9, Pregnanci es.  
 Safety Stopping Guidance 5.8.3
In addition to the pre-scheduled data reviews and planned safety monitoring, the DSMB may 
be called upon for ad hoc reviews or emergency meetings. The DSMB will review any event 
that potentially impacts safety at the request of the protocol chair or DAIT/NIAID. The 
DSMB will have the discretion to recommend actions regarding study conduct and 
continuation as a consequence of any planned or unplanned monitoring activity.  
In addition to the planned safety reviews, the DSMB will be informed of the following event s 
as they occur: 
 Any i mmediately life threatening event or death that occurs in the study that is at least 
possibly related to study intervention 
 Two or more subjects with QT-prolongations defined as QTc prolongation > 500 
msec total duration and > 60 msec from Visit 1 (Day 1) QTc interval prior to study 
drug administration 
Clinical Protocol: ALE09  Page 53 of 125 CONFIDENTIAL  
 
 
Version 4.0   05 October  2018 
 In addition, the following events will trigger both a comprehensive DSMB Emergency Safety 
Review and a temporary halt in enrollment: 
 After the first 20 subjects are randomized, the occurrence of a Grade 3 or higher 
unexpected SAE in 10%  or more of the study participants who have received study 
drug 
 Two  grade 3 or above AEs with the same or similar preferred terms associated with 
CB1 agonists deemed at least possibly-related to study drug.  
 Deter mination of unexpected, significant, or unacceptable risks to subjects that 
contraindicate further dosing of additional subjects, in the opinion of the Protocol 
Chairs or DAIT 
 Any n ew safety information about JBT-101 from other clinical trials that would pose 
signi
ficant or unacceptable risk to subjects 
In the event of a temporary halt in enrollment, no new subjects will be consented or start on 
therapy with JBT-101 or placebo; and subjects already on JBT-101  or placebo will continue 
on therapy unless they are the focus of the DSMB review. Subjects in the screening phase of 
the study may continue to undergo minimal risk procedures (e.g., blood tests), but more than 
minimal risk procedures should be deferred. Randomization will not occur until the DSMB 
review is complete. The FDA will be notified of any halt in enrollment. After careful review 
of the data, the DSMB will make recommendations regarding study conduct and/or 
continuation. 
6 ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY AND EFFICACY 
6.1 Assessments of Eligibility and Safety 
The following laboratory safety tests will be done at regularly scheduled intervals: 
hematology (CBCs with cell differential and platelet count); chemistry (complete metabolic 
panel
 including electrolytes, renal function, and liver function tests); urinalysis with 
m
icroscopic examination; and pregnancy testing in women with childbearing potential.  
Medi
cal history,  physical examination, and prior medications will be completed at Screening, 
for purposes of eligibility. Physical examination results, adverse events, and concomitant 
m
edications will be recorded as per Table 3 , Schedule of Events .  
Psychoactivity of JBT
-101 will be assessed using the ARCI-M questionnaire at Visit 1 (Day 
1) and follow-up visits per Table 3, Schedul e of Events . Twelve-lead ECGs and QT/QTc 
intervals will be assessed at Screening and at Visit 1 (Day 1) and Visit 5 (Day 85). Both 
ARCI -
M questionnaire and QT/QTc intervals will be assessed on Visit 1 (Day 1) prior to 
treatment and between 2.5 and 3.5 hours after the first dose of JBT-101, when plasma 
concent
rations of JBT-101 should be about maximal. 
Clinical Protocol: ALE09  Page 54 of 125 CONFIDENTIAL  
 
 
Version 4.0   05 October  2018 
 Blood and urine laboratory safety tests, CRP, anti-DNA antibody tests, C3 levels, C4 levels, 
and urine protein/creatinine measurements will be done in central laboratories. A central 
re
ading center will be used to determine QT/QTc intervals.  
 Medical History and Use of Contraception 6.1.1
At Screening, a medical history will be performed and include subject demographics, history 
of SLE including current symptoms and past and present organ involvement, and current 
treatment for SLE. The medical history assessment will include concurrent illnesses, other 
current medications, past medical history, and review of systems. Child-bearing potential, 
last menstrual period and u se of effective methods of contraception will be assessed for all 
women at Screening (See Appendix A: Reproductive Potential and Effective Methods of 
Contrac
eption).  Date of last menstrual period will be assessed for all women of childbearing 
pote
ntial at Visits 1 (Day 1) and follow-up visits per Table 3, Schedul e of Events . Concurrent 
il
lnesses, current medications, and review of body systems will occur at Visits 1 (Day 1) and 
follow
-up visits per Table 3, Schedule of Events . Changes from Visit 1 (Day 1) that constitute 
adverse 
events should be reported (See Section 7.4, Grading and Attribution of Adverse 
Events ).  
 Concomitant Medication and Treatment History 6.1.2
A list of current prescription and over-the-counter medications, supplements, and treatments 
for SLE will be obtained. Assessment of eligibility should include a review of permitted and 
prohibited medications. Concomitant medications will be recorded on the concomitant 
medication eCRF from Screening through Visit 6 (Day 113). The medication, dose, 
frequency, route, start
 date, stop date, and indication will be captured. 
 Physical Examination 6.1.3
At Screening, a physical examination is performed to assist in determining the subject’s 
eligibility for the study. Physical examinations also will be performed at Visits 1 (Day 1) and 
follow
-up visits per Table 3, Schedule of Events . Physical examinations will include th e 
following assessment: alertness and orientation, general appearance, skin, head, eyes, ears, 
nose, and throat, lungs, heart, peripheral pulses, abdomen, musculoskeletal examination 
including tender, swollen, and painful joints, reflexes and lymph nodes. Breast and 
genitourinary examinations are not required. The Visit 1 (Day 1) physical examination will 
be use
d as baseline. 
 Vital Signs, Height and Weight Measurements 6.1.4
Weight, systolic and diastolic BP, pulse (P), respiratory rate (R), and temperature will be 
recorded on Screening and all Visits. Weight will be measured with outerwear, such as coats 
and jackets, and footwear removed. The systolic and diastolic BP will be measured with the 
patient seated and will be recorded after at least 5 minutes of rest. The same arm will be used 
for the measurement throughout the study. Pulse will also be measured with the subject 
seated at rest for at least 5 minutes. Body temperature will be measured on the skin or in the 
Clinical Protocol: ALE09  Page 55 of 125 CONFIDENTIAL  
 
 
Version 4.0   05 October  2018 
 mouth. These vital sign measurements should be obtained prior to taking samples for the 
laboratory testing at the applicable study visits. Standing height is to be measured at Visit 1 
(Day 1) with footwear removed.  
 Diseas
e Flares for Safety Assessment 6.1.5
The original lupus instruments to assess disease flares included  an evaluation of proteinuria 
based on the protein:creatinine ratio derived from a 24-hour urine.  For this study, the 
protein:creatinine ratio will typically be derived from the spot urine assessment although a 
24-hour urine may be used if the investigator believes it is indicated. 
 SE
LENA SLEDAI (28 day assessment) 6.1.5.1
The SELE
NA SLEDAI is a validated measure of global disease activity in SLE and was 
modified from the original SLEDAI for the SELENA clinical trial in 1997. The original 
SLEDAI was developed in 1992; it includes both subjective reports from patients and 
objective findings from physicians and laboratory data [ 111]. The SELENA SLEDAI 
modif
ication of the original SLEDAI changed some of the item definitions in order to clarify 
attribution and change in disease activity. These included changes to definitions of seizure 
activity, strokes, serositis, visual disturbances and proteinuria [ 109, 112]. 
The SELE
NA SLEDAI is a one page assessment that contains 24 items covering 9 organs 
systems and items are scored as either present or absent. Each item is assigned a weighted 
score. Two systems can score a maximum of 8 points each, 2 systems can score a maximum 
of 4 points each, 3 systems can score a maximum of 2 points each, and 2 systems can score a 
maximum of 1 point each. Scores range from 0–105 points. A score of 6 is considered 
clinically important and may affect the decision to treat. The original SLEDAI captured 
disease activity within the 10 days prior to assessment; however, this time period was 
extended to include the previous 30 days [ 113, 114 ] . 
The SLEDAI does not record improving or worsening, and does not include severity within 
an or
gan system. The sensitivity to change is less for the SLEDAI than other commonly used 
outcome measures in SLE [ 115]. 
 BIL
AG 2004 6.1.5.2
The purpose of the BILAG is to assess organ-specific SLE activity based upon the “intent- to-
treat” premise. The updated version (BILAG 2004) was published in 2005 and is a validated 
measure of disease activity [ 110]. BILAG 2004 assesses 97 clinical signs, symptoms and 
la
boratory parameters important in SLE across nine organ systems. Each symptom is scored 
with respect to severity over the previous 28 days (0 = not present, 1 = improving, 2 = same, 
3 = worse, and 4 = new). The BILAG provides a more sensitive measure of change than the 
SLEDAI [ 115].  
As above, each question is recorded as 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. The BILAG 2004 scoring algorithm 
categorizes disease activity into 5 different levels from A–E. Grade A represents very active 
dise
ase likely necessitating immunosuppressive drugs and/or a prednisolone (or equivalent) 
Clinical Protocol: ALE09  Page 56 of 125 CONFIDENTIAL  
 
 
Version 4.0   05 October  2018 
 dose of > 20 mg daily or high-dose anti-coagulation. Grade B represents moderate disease 
activity prompting consideration of a lower dose of corticosteroids, topical steroids, topical 
immunosuppressive drugs, anti-malarial drugs, or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. 
Grade C indicates mild stable disease, while grade D implies no disease activity but the 
system had previously been affected. Grade E indicates no current or previous disease 
activity. 
 Flare Definitions  6.1.5.3
Disease flares will be defined using SELENA SLEDAI Flare Index and BILAG 2004 
assessments. See Section 3.2.3, Safety Endpoints  and Section 7.4.1, Grading Criteria for 
definit
ions and severity grading requirements.  
The SELENA SLEDAI Flare Index categorizes disease flares as mild/moderate or severe, 
based on the highest categories of clinical features recorded or by treatment 
recommendations by the physician.  
SELENA SLEDAI and BILAG 2004 disease flares will be identified centrally at the DAIT-
SACCC.  
 Blood and Urine Laboratory Safety Tests 6.1.6
Blood and urine laboratory safety tests will be performed throughout the study. The results of 
all tests will be reviewed by the investigator or qualified designee, who will make judgments 
on the medical significance of any new or worsening abnormal value. The results of clinical 
laboratory tests at Screening will assist in identifying subjects who are not suitable for the 
study
 due to some biochemical or hematological abnormalities. 
The results of clinical laboratory tests at Visit 1 (Day 1) prior to study drug administration 
will
 provide a baseline reference against which any fluctuations in these test results during 
the
 treatment phase of the trial can be compared. Abnormal tests will be reported as adverse 
event
s if they meet grading and reporting criteria (See Section 7.4, Grading and Attribution 
of Adver
se Events ). 
All laboratory safety tests will be performed in licensed clinical laboratories, according to the 
study schedule. The majority of the laboratory safety tests will be done centrally.  
 Electrocardiograms and QT/QTc Intervals 6.1.7
Twelve-lead ECGs are to be recorded in triplicate at Screening and Visits 1 (Day 1) and 5 
(Day 85)
. They will be evaluated for medically significant abnormalities and QT/QTc 
intervals. The QT/QTc intervals will be measured at Visit 1 (Day 1) before administration 
and 
between 2.5 and 3.5 hours after administration of study product in the clinic, at the time 
of maximum JBT-101  concentration in the blood. 
The triplet twelve-lead ECGs are to be recorded at least 5 minutes apart, with the subject in a 
re
sted supine position for at least 10 minutes. Food and drink should not be consumed by the 
Clinical Protocol: ALE09  Page 57 of 125 CONFIDENTIAL  
 
 
Version 4.0   05 October  2018 
 subject within the 30 minutes before the ECGs are to be recorded. A central reading center 
will be used to read all ECGs and determine QT/QTc intervals. 
A
bnormal ECG findings will be reported as adverse events if they meet grading and 
re
porting criteria (See Section 7.4, Grading and Attribution of Adverse Events ).  
 ARCI -M Questionnaire 6.1.8
The ARCI-M questionnaire will be completed by subjects at Visits 1 (Day 1), 3 (Day 29), 
and 5
 (Day 85). This is a 12-item yes-no questionnaire developed by the National Institute on 
Drug Abuse, desi
gned to detect the full range of subjective responses experienced by 
marijuana users [ 106]. The ARCI-M questionnaire has been validated by subjects following 
m
arijuana smoking. The subject will be asked to fill out the ARCI-M questionnaire prior to 
other interactions with study staff except for Visit 1 (Day 1). At Visit 1 (Day 1), the ARCI- M 
quest
ionnaire will be completed at the beginning of the visit, prior to interaction with study 
staff and between 2.5 and 3.5 hours after administration of study product in the clinic, at the 
time of maximum JBT-101 concentration in the blood. Evidence of psychotropic effects of 
the
 study drug in subjects will be identified by an increase of ≥ 1 in the ARCI-M score 
assessed longitudinally.  
 Pregnancies 6.1.9
The effect of JBT-101 in pregnancy is unknown in women who become pregnant while 
ta
king JBT-101 or in women who become pregnant by male partners who are taking JBT-
101
. The effect of semen from men who are taking JBT-101 on pregnancies is unknown. 
W
omen subjects of childbearing potential will be instructed to inform the investigator if they 
become pregnant during the study and within 28 days after taking the final dose of study 
drug). If the pregnancy occurs during the treatment period, the investigator should 
discontinue the study drug and instruct the subject to return any unused portion of study drug 
to the study staff. Male subjects whose partner(s) becomes pregnant while the male subject is 
on JBT-101 or within 28 days after the male subject’s last dose of JBT-101 will be instructed 
to i
nform the investigator of the pregnancy. The investigator will counsel male and female 
subjects about the risks of the pregnancy and the possible effects on the fetus. 
See Section 7.6, Pregnancy Reporting  for instructions on how to report pregnancies. 
 Tuberculosis Screening 6.1.10
To protect subject safety, subjects should not have untreated tuberculosis during the study 
with JBT-101. For that reason, tests for tuberculosis infection will be part of screening. 
Scre
ening for tuberculosis will be consistent with Centers for Disease Control guidelines 
(http://www.cdc.gov/tb/publications/LTBI/pdf/TargetedLTBI.pdf ). All subjects will be tested 
for tuberculosis using a central QuantiFERON® - TB Gold In-Tube Test (QuantiFERON®), 
unle
ss they: 1) have a history of a positive tuberculosis screening test and have completed a 
course of appropriate treatment or have received at least one month of appropriate treatment 
prior to Visit 1 (Day 1) and will continue to receive appropriate treatment during the study; 
Clinical Protocol: ALE09  Page 58 of 125 CONFIDENTIAL  
 
 
Version 4.0   05 October  2018 
 or 2) have a documented negative test for tuberculosis within 12 months prior to Visit 1 (Day 
1).  
 The QuantiFERON® blood test will be run centrally, and that lab will set the cutoff 
for posit
ive test. If the results of the blood test are indeterminate and the subject is 
low ri
sk for tuberculosis in the opinion of the investigator, no further testing is needed 
for eligibility. Otherwise, if a blood test result is indeterminate, the site investigator 
can repeat a blood test and/or do a PPD skin test.  
All subj
ects with a positive test for tuberculosis are excluded from this study unless they 
have completed a course of appropriate treatment or have received at least one month of 
appropriate treatment prior to Visit 1 (Day 1) and will continue to receive appropriate 
tr
eatment during the study (S ee Section 4.2, Exclusion Criteria ).  
6.2 Assessments of Efficacy 
 Primary Efficacy Variable: Maximum Daily Pain NRS Score 6.2.1
Efficacy will be assessed using the maximum daily pain NRS score. The pain NRS is a 
single-item pain numerical rating scale for pain, which is a segmented numerical version of 
the visual analogue scale in which the respondent selects a whole number (0-10) that best 
reflects the intensity of their pain. The numerical rating score is anchored by two terms 
describing average pain severity extremes, one of “no pain” (score of 0) and one of “worst 
pain imaginable” (score of 10). The subjects will be instructed to rank their worst pain in the 
previous day, at about the same time each evening, so the recall period is about 24 hours of 
the
 most recent entry. The subjects will record their maximum daily pain NRS score each day 
using an IVRS (See Section 3.1, Description of Study Design .).  
Sit
e personnel will receive daily notifications indicating if subjects have not completed their 
most recent pain scores and they will be responsible for contacting subjects to ensure pain 
scores are completed regularly. Sites will also receive monthly reports on overall compliance 
and 
data integrity. 
 Secondary Efficacy Variables 6.2.2
For any i
ndividual subject, the same physician should, if possible, assess the 66/68 joint 
count
, physician-reported components of the SELENA SLEDAI and BILAG 2004 score, and 
the Physician’s Global Assessment. The SLE Responder Index, SELENA SLEDAI score, 
and BILAG 2004 domain scores will all be calculated centrally at the DAIT-SACCC. 
 Response Categories 6.2.2.1
Im
provement will be computed at the % change in the 7-day average of maximum daily pain 
NRS scores from Visits 1(Day 1) to Visits 3 (Day 29), 4  (Day 57), 5 (Day 85), and 6 (Day 
113)
.  Categories for 30%,  50%, 75% and 100% improvement will be evaluated. 
Clinical Protocol: ALE09  Page 59 of 125 CONFIDENTIAL  
 
 
Version 4.0   05 October  2018 
  Pain Categories 6.2.2.2
Change in pain category from baseline will be determined. Categories of pain, as defined by 
the 7-day average of maximum daily pain NRS, are: 
 No pain:  7-day average of maximum daily pain NRS ≤ 1 
 Mi ld pain: 7-day average of maximum daily pain NRS > 1 and ≤ 3 
 Moder ate pain: 7-day average of maximum daily pain NRS > 3 and ≤ 7  
 Sever e pain: 7-day average of maximum daily pain NRS > 7 
Changes i
n categories of pain, as defined by the 7-day average of maximum daily pain NRS 
are: 
 Maj or improvement: Improvement by at least two pain categories from baseline 
(Visit 1 (Day 1)) 
 Improvement: Improvement by one pain category from baseline (Visit 1 (Day 1)) 
 No change:  No change in pain category from baseline (Visit 1 (Day 1)) 
 W orsening: Worsening by at least one pain category from baseline (Visit 1 (Day 1)) 
 66/68 Joint Count 6.2.2.3
Deter
mining the number of swollen joints and tender joints is a key component in the clinical 
ass
essment of active musculoskeletal disease in this study. This study will assess swelling 
and t
enderness in 66 and tenderness in 68 joints, which includes joints in the feet. The 66/68 
joi
nt count evaluates the following joints: upper—temporomandibular, sternoclavicular, 
acromioclavicular, shoulder, elbow, wrist, metacarpophalangeal, proximal interphalangeal 
and distal interphalangeal; lower—hip, knee, ankle, tarsus, metatarsophalangeal and 
int
erphalangeal. 
Swelling and tenderness are measured separately. Joint swelling is soft tissue swelling that is 
detectable along the joint margins. When a synovial effusion is present, it invariably means 
the joint is swollen. Neither bony swelling nor deformity of the joints constitutes joint 
swelling. Fluctuation is a characteristic feature of swollen joints and it may influence the 
range of joint movement.  
Joint tenderness is the presence of pain in a joint at rest with pressure or on movement of the 
joint, e.g. on movement of the hip joints. Pressure to elicit tenderness should be exerted by 
the examiner's thumb and index finger sufficient to cause blanching of the examiner's nail 
bed.  
 Disease Activity 6.2.2.4
See Section 6.1.5.1 and 6.1.5.2  for discussion of the SELENA SLEDAI and BILAG 2004.  
For each, longitudinal changes in total scores will be evaluated.[ 109-112, 114-116].   
Clinical Protocol: ALE09  Page 60 of 125 CONFIDENTIAL  
 
 
Version 4.0   05 October  2018 
 The Physician’s Global Assessment utilizes a 0 to 3 visual analogue scale that is anchored by 
ver
bal descriptors as follows; 0 = none, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe. It is widely used 
in the assessment of disease activity in SLE and provides a simple, broad and accurate 
assessment from the examiner’s perspective [ 117]. The assessment should be completed as 
soon as possible after all information including laboratory test results for that visit is 
available to the physician. An increase of ≥ 0.3 points is considered worsening of the 
Physician’s Global Assessment [ 118, 119]. Both mean change from Visit 1 (Day 1) and 
propor
tion of subjects with worsening of the Physician’s Global Assessment will be tested. 
The SLE Responder Index is a composite index incorporating both the SELENA SLEDAI 
and BILAG
 indices and the Physician’s Global Assessment [ 1 19]. 
 Patient-reported Outcomes 6.2.3
All patient-reported outcome questionnaires should be completed by the subject prior to any 
other study-related procedures. 
 Lu
pus Activity Patient Global Assessment 6.2.3.1
The Lupus Activity Patient Global Assessment is performed with a visual analogue scale (0 – 
100) i
n which the subject is asked to indicate how active she/he thinks her disease is. The 
visual analogue scale is anchored by two descriptors; “not active” (score of 0) and 
“extremely active” (score of 100). The recall period is one week.  
 PROMIS Forms 6.2.3.2
The PROMIS-29 Short Form, Version 2.0, will be used to assess patient-reported state of 
heal
th. The NIH established PROMIS (www.nihpromis.org) to create a standardized and 
uniformly scored set of patient-reported-outcomes instruments. The PROMIS network 
developed item (question) banks and short forms in more than 20 health domains, as well as, 
a se
t of global health items and 29-, 43-, and 57-item profile measures. The seven domains 
specifically relate to physical, mental and social health and cover the most relevant areas of 
sel
f-reported health for the greatest majority of people with chronic illness: pain, fatigue, 
depression, anxiety, sleep and physical function. The PROMIS-29 includes four items each 
fro
m these seven core PROMIS domains as well as one 10 -point rating scale for pain 
intensity. Norm-based scores have been calculated for each domain, such that a score of 50 
represents the mean of the general population (standard deviation = 10). High scores 
represent more of the domain being measured. Thus, on symptom-oriented domains of 
PROMIS-29 (anxiety, depression, fatigue, sleep disturbance, and pain interference), higher 
scor
es represent worse symptomatology. On the function-oriented domains (physical 
functioning and social role), higher scores represent better functioning.  
The PROMIS-29 includes a single-item pain NRS, which is a segmented numerical version 
of
 the visual analogue scale in which the respondent selects a whole number (0-10 integers) 
that best reflects the intensity of their pain. The numerical rating score is anchored by two 
Clinical Protocol: ALE09  Page 61 of 125 CONFIDENTIAL  
 
 
Version 4.0   05 October  2018 
 terms describing average pain severity extremes, one of “no pain” (score of 0) and one of 
“worst pain imaginable” (score of 10). The recall period is 7 days.  
The PR
OMIS Item Bank v2.0 - Cognitive Function instrument is part of PROMIS. The 
PR
OMIS v2.0 Cognitive Function item bank contains 32 questions to assess adult patient-
per
ceived functional abilities with regard to cognitive tasks. 
 Fibromyalgia Symptom Scale 6.2.3.3
The Fibromyalgia Symptom Scale is a modification of the ACR 2010 criteria (Modified 
2011)
 for fibromyalgia that allows use of the ACR 2010 criteria without the requirement for 
an exa
miner[ 107]. The criteria are simple to use and administer. The Widespread Pain Index 
and t
he Symptom Severity Scale comprised the ACR 2010 criteria. The Symptom Score was 
modif
ied by eliminating the physician’s estimate of the extent of somatic symptoms and 
substituting the sum of 3 specific self-reported symptoms. Then, a 0–31 Fibromyalgia 
Sy
mptom Scale was created by adding the Widespread Pain Index to the modified Symptom 
Severity Scale. The criteria properly identify diagnostic groups based on fibromyalgia 
severity variables. A Fibromyalgia Symptom Scale score = 13 best separates criteria positive 
and cr
iteria negative patients, classifying 93.0% correctly, with a sensitivity of 96.6% and a 
specificity of 91.8%. 
 Treatment Satisfaction Survey 6.2.4
At the end of treatment, both the subject and physician will complete separately a survey 
asking what treatment assignment they think that subject received (JBT-101, placebo, or 
can’
t tell), whether the subject received benefit from the assigned treatment (yes or no), and 
whether the subject or physician would chose to continue that treatment (yes or no). 
6.3 Mechanistic Studies 
 Biomarkers of Inflammation 6.3.1
Specimens for evaluation of biomarkers of active inflammation in SLE (detailed below) will 
be 
collected at Visits 1 (Day 1) and follow-up visits per Table 3, Schedule of Events .  
 C-reactive Protein 6.3.1.1
C-reactive protein levels will be measured in peripheral blood. Elevated CRP levels have 
been reported in SLE, although levels do not always correlate with disease activity [ 120]. 
 Pro-Inflammatory Cytokines 6.3.1.2
Production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, IFNα, IFNγ, IL-6, TNFα and IL-1β, in peripheral 
blood
 will be evaluated in vitro in unstimulated and stimulated cell cultures. Supernatants 
from cultures with and without stimulant will be frozen and batched for analysis.   
Clinical Protocol: ALE09  Page 62 of 125 CONFIDENTIAL  
 
 
Version 4.0   05 October  2018 
  Type 1 IFN  gene signature 6.3.1.3
Type 1 IFN  gene signature will be assessed from whole blood RNA.  Gene expression will 
be anal
yzed using published data for IFNα inducible genes [ 121] and second generation 
modular t
ranscriptional repertoire analyses [ 122].  
 Met
abolipidomic Profile 6.3.2
Met
abolipidomic profiles will be assessed in plasma at Visit 1 (Day 1) and Visit 2 (Day 15). 
At Visit 1 (Day 1), metabolipidomic profiles will be assessed before and 2.5 to 3.5 hours 
after
 study product is administered. The metabolipidomic profiles will include measurement 
of certain SPMs, anti-inflammatory eicosanoids, and pro-inflammatory eicosanoids. As 
possi
ble, the blood samples for metabolipidomic profile testing should be collected at least 2 
hours after the last solid meal.  
 JBT-101 Plasma Concentrations and Metabolites 6.3.3
Plasm
a concentrations of JBT-101 and its metabolites will be measured at Visit 1 (Day 1) 
and Visi
t 2 (Day 15). At Visit 1 (Day 1), plasma levels of JBT-101 and metabolites will be 
m
easured before and 2.5 to 3.5 hours after study product is administered. 
JBT-
101 plasma concentrations and metabolites will be measured using validated assays 
[101]
. Collection at 3 hours after dosing should provide concentrations near peak plasma 
concentrations and first pass metabolites.  
 Optional Unspecified Future Studies 6.3.4
If the subject provides written informed consent, extra serum and leftover specimens derived 
from blood samples, including serum, plasma, mRNA, whole blood cells, and whole blood 
cells culture supernatants, will be stored for future unspecified studies related to JBT-101, the 
imm
une system, or SLE.  
In addition, if appropriate consents are given, peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC ) 
samples for future, unspecified, IRB approved studies related to JBT-101, the immune 
syst
em, or SLE will be collected at Visit 1 (Day 1) and follow-up visits per Table 3, Schedule 
of Eve
nts.  
 Blood Draw Prioritization 6.3.5
The volume of blood to be drawn at a given visit is limited under the following situations: 
 Should the subject have been experiencing severe anemia (hemoglobin < 8g/dL) or 
have poor venous access, the blood draw limit is 30 mL.   
 Should t he subject have been experiencing moderate-severe anemia (hemoglobin 8-9 
g/dL), the blood draw limit is 50 mL.  
Clinical Protocol: ALE09  Page 63 of 125 CONFIDENTIAL  
 
 
Version 4.0   05 October  2018 
  In any patient whose clinical condition might be adversely affected by removal of the 
volumes required for this protocol, for example, patients with significant anemia (as 
noted above) or compromised cardiac output, investigators should consider further 
li
miting the volume of blood withdrawn for research purposes. 
The priority of samples to collect is as follows:  
NOT E: Whole blood for pro-inflammatory cytokines should always be drawn first in the 
TruCulture tubes. 
 W hole blood: TruCulture tubes, pro-inflamma tory cytokine s (3 mL) 
 Safety dra ws: chemistries, hematologies, anti-dsDNA, C3, C4, CRP (8-1 1 mL, 
depending on visit) 
 Blood/pl asma: metabolipidomic profile, and JBT-101 plasma concentrations and  
metabolites (4 mL) (Note: For Visit 1 (Day 1 ), blood is collected twice; pre-dose and 
post
-dose; the post-dose blood draw can be eliminated if indicated) 
 RNA:  Type 1 IFN  gene signature (2.5 mL) 
 Serum  for future use (5 mL; limit to 2 mL if necessary)  
 PB MCs for future use (30 mL; omit totally for severe anemia or poor venous access) 
6.4 Evaluati
ons by Study Visit 
Refer to Table 3, Schedule of Events  (below) for a complete listing of evaluations by study 
visit. 
 Screening Period 6.4.1
This study will be explained in lay language to each potential participant. Each participant 
will sign an informed consent form before committing to study screening procedures. 
Unless otherwise specified, the screening evaluations must be performed within 42 days prior 
to 
Visit 1 (Day 1). Screening will take place over multiple days. The 7-day average of 
m
aximum daily pain NRS score will be calculated by the IVRS to assess eligibility.  
Screening laboratory tests, except HIV, hepatitis, and pregnancy testing, may be repeated to 
establish eligibility within the 42 day window prior to Visit 1 (Day 1), at the investigator’s 
disc
retion. Subjects who fail screening may be rescreened at a later date, if the investigator 
judges it likely that the reason for failing to meet eligibility criteria is no longer present. 
The following procedures will be performed during the Screening Period: 
 Consent pr esentation and consent signing 
 Consent for optional storage and future use of de-identified left-over blood-derived 
specimens

  Unscheduled Visits 6.4.4
Subjects will be instructed to call study personnel to report any abnormalities during the 
intervals between study visits and to come to the study site if medical evaluation is needed 
and the urgency of the situation permits. An unscheduled visit will be made, if necessary, for 
medical issues that arise between study visits. For emergency and other unscheduled visits to 
a m
edical facility other than the study site, medical records will be obtained by the site 
investigator or qualified designee. 
If an unscheduled visit is necessary to assess the subject for safety purposes, the following 
eval

 7 SAFETY MONITORING AND REPORTING 
7.1 Overview 
This section defines the types of safety data that will be collected under this protocol and 
outlines the procedures for appropriately collecting, grading, recording, and reporting those 
data. Adverse events that are classified as serious according to the definition of health 
authorities must be reported promptly (per Section 7.5.4, Reporting of Adverse Events to 
IRBs ) t
o the DAIT/NIAID.  Appropriate notifications will also be made to site principal 
investigators, Institutional Review Boards (IRBs), and health authorities.  
Information in this section complies with ICH Guideline E2A: Clinical Safety Data 
Management: Definitions and Standards for Expedited Reporting, ICH Guideline E -6: 
Guideli
ne for Good Clinical Practice, 21CFR Parts 312 and 320, and applies the standards set 
forth in the National Cancer Institute (NCI), Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse 
Events (CTCAE), Version 4 : http://ctep.cancer.gov/reporting/ctc.html . 
7.2 Definitions 
 Adverse Event (AE)  7.2.1
Any untoward or unfavorable medical occurrence associated with the subject’s participation 
in the research, whether or not considered related to the subject’s participation in the research 
(modified from the definition of adverse events in the 1996 International Conference on 
Harmonization E-6 Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice) (from OHRP "Guidance on 
Reviewing and Reporting Unanticipated Problems Involving Risks to Subjects or Others and 
Adverse Events (1/15/07)" http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/policy/advevntguid.html#Q2  )  
 Suspected Adverse Reaction (SAR)  7.2.1.1
Any adverse event for which there is a reasonable possibility that the investigational drug [or 
investigational study therapy regimen] caused the adverse event. For the purposes of safety 
reporting, ‘reasonable possibility’ means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship 
between the drug and the adverse event. A suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser degree 
of certainty about causality than adverse reaction, which means any adverse event caused by 
a drug (21 CFR 312.32(a)). 
 Unexpected Adverse Event  7.2.2
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “unexpected” if it is not listed 
in the Investigator Brochure or is not listed at the specificity, severity or rate of occurrence 
tha
t has been observed; or is not consistent with the risk information described in the general 
investigational plan or elsewhere in the IND.  
Clinical Protocol: ALE09  Page 79 of 125 CONFIDENTIAL  
 
 
 
Version 4.0  05 October 2018  
  “Unexpected” also refers to adverse events or suspected adverse reactions that are 
mentioned in the Investigator Brochure or package insert as occurring with a class of drugs 
or as anticipated from the pharmacological properties of the drug, but are not specifically 
mentioned as occurring with the particular drug under investigation (21 CFR 312.32(a)).  
 Serious Adverse Event (SAE) 7.2.3
An advers
e event  or suspected adverse reaction is considered “serious” if, in the view of 
ei
ther the investigator or Sponsor [DAIT/NIAID], it results in any of the following outcomes 
(21 CFR 312.32(a)): 
 Death.  
 A life-threatening event: An AE or SAR is considered “life-threatening” if, in the 
vie
w of either the investigator or DAIT/NIAID , its occurrence places the subject at 
imm
ediate risk of death. It does not include an AE or SAR that, had it occurred in a 
more severe form, might have caused death.  
 Inpa tient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization. 
 Pers istent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct 
normal life functions. 
 Congenit al anomaly or birth defect.  
 Important medical events that may not result in death, be life threatening, or require 
hospitalization may be considered serious when, based upon appropriate medical 
judgment, they may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. 
Elective hospitalizations or hospital admissions for the purpose of conduct of protocol 
mandated procedures are not to be reported as an SAE unless hospitalization is prolonged 
due to complications. 
 Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESI) 7.2.4
Adverse
 Events of Special Interest will be collected and reported to the IND sponsor 
(NIAID), the NIAID Autoimmune DSMB, and to the manufacturer (Corbus Pharmaceuticals 
Holdings, Inc. ).  
 QTc prolongation > 500 msec total duration and > 60 msec from Visit 1 (Day 1) QTc 
int
erval prior to study drug administration 
 Sever e disease flares by SELENA SLEDAI Flare Index and/or a new BILAG A score 
except in musculoskeletal domain 
Clinical Protocol: ALE09  Page 80 of 125 CONFIDENTIAL  
 
 
 
Version 4.0  05 October 2018  
  Aspartate aminotransferase or alanine aminotransferase ≥ 3 x upper limit of normal 
and total bilirubin > 1.5 x the upper limit of normal, present on repeat testing 
If an event
 meets any of the above AESI categories, regardless of the relationship of the 
event
 to the study drug or severity, the event must be reported to the IND sponsor 
(DAIT/NIAID) as described in Section 7.5.2 , Reporting of AESIs to DAIT/NIAID  and to 
Corbus Pharmaceuticals Holdings, Inc. as described in Section 7.5.5, Reporting of Safety 
Inf
ormation (AEs, SAEs and AESIs) to Corbus . 
7.3 Collec
tion and Recording of Adverse Events 
 Collection Period 7.3.1
AEs of Grade 2 and above will be collected from time of signing of informed consent until 
the subject com
pletes study participation, or until 30 days after he/she prematurely withdraws 
(without withdrawing consent), or is withdrawn from the study. See Section 7.4, Grading 
and Attribution of Adverse Events  for grading criteria. 
 Collec
ting Adverse Events 7.3.2
Adverse events (including SAEs) may be discovered through any of these methods: 
 Observi ng the subject. 
 Int erviewing the subject [e.g., using a checklist, structured questioning, diary, etc.]. 
 Receiving an unsolicited complaint from the subject. 
 In a ddition, an abnormal value or result from a clinical or laboratory evaluation can 
also indicate an adverse event, as defined in Section 7.4, Grading and Attribution of 
Adverse
 Events . 
 Recording Adverse Events 7.3.3
Throughout the study, the investigator will record adverse events and serious adverse events 
as described previously (Section 7.2, Defi nitions ) on the appropriate AE eCRF regardless of 
the
 relationship to study therapy regimen or study procedure. 
Once recorded, an AE/SAE will be followed until it resolves with or without sequelae, or 
until the end of study participation, whichever occurs first.  End of study participation is the 
final study visit, either at time of study completion or when a subject prematurely withdraws 
or is withdrawn. 
Clinical Protocol: ALE09  Page 81 of 125 CONFIDENTIAL  
 
 
 
Version 4.0  05 October 2018  
 7.4 Grading and Attribution of Adverse Events 
 Grading Criteria 7.4.1
The study site will grade the severity of adverse events experienced by the study subjects 
according to the criteria set forth in the National Cancer Institute’s Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.   This document (referred to herein as the 
NCI-CTCAE manual) provides a common language to describe levels of severity, to analyze 
and interpret data, and to articulate the clinical significance of all adverse events. The NCI-
CTCAE has been reviewed by the Protocol Chairs and has been deemed appropriate for the 
subject population to be studied in this protocol.  
Adverse events will be graded on a scale from 1 to 5 according to the following standards in 
the NCI-CTCAE manual: 
 Grade 1 = mil d adverse event. 
 Grade 2 = modera te adverse event. 
 Grade 3 = s evere and undesirable adverse event. 
 Grade 4 = lif e-threatening or disabling adverse event. 
 Grade 5 = death.  
For grading an abnormal value or result of a clinical or laboratory evaluation (including, but 
not limited to, a radiograph, an ultrasound, an electrocardiogram etc.), a treatment-emergent 
adverse event is defined as an increase in grade from baseline or from the last post-baseline 
value that doesn’t meet grading criteria (i.e. Grade 0, normal). Similarly, c hanges from 
scr
eening to baseline will also be recorded as adverse events, but these are not treatment-
emergent.  If a specific event or result from a given clinical or laboratory evaluation is not 
inc
luded in the NCI-CTCAE manual, then an abnormal result would be considered an 
adverse event if changes in therapy or monitoring are implemented as a result of the 
event
/result. Grade 2 or higher AEs will be reported on the appropriate AE electronic case 
re
port (AE eCRF) for this study. 
In addition, for this study, BILAG 2004 disease flares will be graded as follows: 
 Mi ld SLE flare (Grade 1): New BILAG 2004 grade C in one or more organ systems 
 Moderate SLE flare (Grade 2): New BILAG 2004 grade B in one or more organ 
systems 
 Severe SLE flare (Grade 3): New BILAG 2004 grade A in one organ system 
 Life -threatening or disabling SLE flare (Grade 4): A life-threatening or disabling new 
BILAG 2004 grade A 
Clinical Protocol: ALE09  Page 82 of 125 CONFIDENTIAL  
 
 
 
Version 4.0  05 October 2018  
 New BILAG flares of Grade 2 or higher (i.e. B or A) will be reported as AEs. Mild/moderate 
SELENA SLEDAI flares should be reported as AEs if changes in therapy or monitoring are 
im
plemented. Severe SELENA SLE DAI flares should be reported as AEs . Signs, symptoms 
and laboratory test abnormalities reported as part of a SLE flare will not be reported as 
separate AEs. 
 Attribution Definitions 7.4.2
The relationship, or attribution, of an adverse event to the study therapy regimen or study 
procedure(s) will initially be determined by the site investigator and recorded on the 
appropriate AE eCRF.  Final determination of attribution for safety reporting will be 
determined by DAIT/NIAID.  The relationship of an adverse event to study therapy regimen 
or procedures will be determined using the descriptors and definitions provided in Table 4 
(below).  
       Table 4. Attribution of Adverse Events

7.5 Reporting of Serious Adverse Events and Adverse Events 
 Reporti
ng of Serious Adverse Events to DAIT/NIAID 7.5.1
This section describes the responsibilities of the site investigator to report serious adverse 
events to the sponsor via the DAIT-SACCC.  Timely reporting of adverse events is required 
by 21 CFR and ICH E6 guidelines.  
Site investigators will report all serious adverse events (see Section 7.2.3 , Serious Adverse 
Event ), regardless of relationship or expectedness within 24 hours of discovering the event. 
For serious adverse events, all requested information on the AE/SAE eCRF will be provided.  
However, unavailable details of the event will not delay submission of the known 
Clinical Protocol: ALE09  Page 83 of 125 CONFIDENTIAL  
 
 
 
Version 4.0  05 October 2018  
 information.  As additional details become available, the AE/SAE eCRF will be updated and 
submitted.

 Reporting AESIs to DAIT/NIAID 7.5.2
Af
ter learning that a participant has experienced an AESI, the investigator or designee is 
responsible for reporting the AESI via an eCRF within 24 hours of becoming aware of the 
event
. The initial eCRF should include as much information as possible, but at a minimum 
must include the following: 
 AES I term. 
 Relat ionship to study medications. 
 W hether or not the event meets serious criteria. 
 Supplem entary eCRF pages that are current at the time of AESI reporting: medical 
hist
ory, concomitant medications, demographics, study drug administration, death.  
As additional details become available, the eCRF should be updated and submitted. Every 
time the eCRF is submitted, it should be electronically signed by the investigator or sub-
investigator.  
For additional information regarding reporting, contact the DAIT-SACCC. 
 Reporting to Health Authority 7.5.3
After an adverse event requiring 24 hour reporting (per Section 7.5.1, Reporting of Serious 
Adverse
 Events to DAIT/NIAID ) is submitted by the site investigator and assessed by 
DAIT/NIAID, there are two options for DAIT/NIAID to report the adverse event to the 
appropriate health authorities: 
 Annual Reporting 7.5.3.1
DAIT/NIAID will include in the annual study report to health authorities all adverse events 
classified as: 
 Seri ous, expected, suspected adverse reactions (see Section 7.2.1.1, Suspected 
Adverse
 Reaction , and Section 7.2.2, Unexpect ed Adverse Event ). 
Clinical Protocol: ALE09  Page 84 of 125 CONFIDENTIAL  
 
 
 
Version 4.0  05 October 2018  
  Serious and not a suspected adverse reaction (see Section 7.2.1.1, Suspected Adverse 
React
ion). 
 Pregna ncies. 
Note that all adverse events (not just those requiring 24-hour reporting) will be reported in 
the Annual IND Report. 
 Expedited Safety Reporting 7.5.3.2
This option, with 2 possible categories, applies if the adverse event is classified as one of the 
following: 
Category 1:  Serious and unexpected suspected adverse reaction [SUSAR]  (see Section 
7.2.1.1 , Suspected Adverse Reaction  and S ection 7.2.2, Unexpected Adverse Event  and 21 
CFR 312.32(c)(1)i).  
The sponsor shall report any suspected adverse reaction that is both serious and unexpected.  
The sponsor shall report an adverse event as a suspected adverse reaction only if there is 
evi
dence to suggest a causal relationship between the study drug and the adverse event, such 
as: 
1. A singl e occurrence of an event that is uncommon and known to be strongly 
associated with drug exposure (e.g., angioedema, hepatic injury, or Stevens-
Johnson Syndrome) 
2. One or m ore occurrences of an event that is not commonly associated with drug 
exposure, but is otherwise uncommon in the population exposed to the drug (e.g., 
tendon rupture) 
3. An aggregate anal ysis of specific events observed in a clinical trial (such as 
known consequences of the underlying disease or condition under investigation or 
other events that commonly occur in the study population independent of drug 
therapy) that indicates those events occur more frequently in the drug treatment 
group than in a concurrent or historical control group 
Category 2: Any findings from studies that suggests a significant human risk  
The sponsor shall report any findings from other epidemiological studies, analyses of adverse 
events within the current study or pooled analysis across clinical studies or animal or in vitro 
testing (e.g. mutagenicity, teratogenicity, carcinogenicity) that suggest a significant risk in 
humans exposed to the drug that would result in a safety-related change in the protocol, 
informed consent, investigator brochure or package insert or other aspects of the overall 
conduct of the study.   
Clinical Protocol: ALE09  Page 85 of 125 CONFIDENTIAL  
 
 
 
Version 4.0  05 October 2018  
 DAIT/NIAID shall notify the FDA and all participating investigators of expedited Safety 
Reports within 15 calendar days; unexpected fatal or immediately life-threatening suspected 
adverse reaction(s) shall be reported as soon as possible or within 7 calendar days.  
 Reporting of Adverse Events to IRBs 7.5.4
All investigators shall report adverse events, including expedited reports, in a timely fashion 
to their respective IRBs in accordance with applicable regulations and guidelines. All Safety 
Reports to the FDA  shall be distributed by DAIT/NIAID or designee to all participating 
inst
itutions for site IRB submission. 
 Reporting of Safety Information (AEs, SAEs and AESIs) to Corbus 7.5.5
DAIT/NIAID will report safety information (AEs, SAEs and AESI) to Corbus as follows :  
 For any s afety report that meets all of the following criteria of, (i) serious (ii) 
unexpected and (iii) suspected adverse reaction, NIAID will provide to Corbus a 
completed copy of the initial safety report at the time the initial report is submitted to 
FDA. NIAID will provide follow up information to Corbus at the time the follow up 
safety report is submitted to FDA.  
 NIAID w ill provide monthly listing of safety information (AEs, SAEs, and AESI) to 
Corbus on a monthly basis.  
 NIAID will provide a copy of the IND annual reports at the same time as the 
transmission to the FDA. 
In a
ddition, NIAID will forward the Clinical Study Report as well as any literature articles 
that are a result of the study to Corbus. 
7.6 Pregnancy Reporting 
The inves
tigator shall be informed immediately of any pregnancy in a study subject or a 
partner of a study subject. Pregnancies in women occurring while the subject is on JBT-101 
or wit
hin 28 days after the subject’s last dose of JBT-101 are considered expedited reportable 
event
s.  A pregnant subject shall be instructed to stop taking study medication. The 
investigator shall counsel the subject and discuss the risks of continuing with the pregnancy 
and the possible effects on the fetus. Monitoring of the pregnant subject shall continue until 
the conclusion of the pregnancy. 
The investigator shall report all pregnancies to the DAIT-SACCC within 1 business day of 
becoming aware of the event using the Pregnancy eCRF. All pregnancies identified during 
the study shall be followed to conclusion and the outcome of each must be reported. The 
Pregnancy eCRF shall be updated and submitted to the DAIT-SACCC when details about the 
outcome are available. When possible, similar information shall be obtained for a pregnancy 
occurring in a partner of a study subject. 
Information requested about the delivery shall include: 
Clinical Protocol: ALE09  Page 86 of 125 CONFIDENTIAL  
 
 
 
Version 4.0  05 October 2018  
  Gestational age at delivery 
 Birt h weight, length, and head circumference 
 Gender  
 Appeara nce, pulse, grimace, activity, and respiration (APGAR) score at 1 minute, 5 
minutes, and 24 hours after birth, if available 
 Any abnormalities 
All pregnancy complications that result in a congenital abnormality, birth defect, miscarriage, 
and medically indicated abortion - an SAE shall be submitted to the DAIT-SACCC using the 
SAE
 reporting procedures described above.  
7.7 Reporting of Other Safety Information 
An invest
igator shall promptly notify the site IRB as well as the DAIT/NIAID when an 
“unanticipa
ted problem involving risks to subjects or others” is identified, which is not 
otherwise reportable as an adverse event. 
7.8 Review of Safety Information 
 Medic
al Monitor Review 7.8.1
The DAIT/NIAID Medical Monitor shall receive monthly reports from the DAIT-SACCC 
compiling new and accumulating information on AEs, SAEs, AESI and pregnancies recorded 
by the
 study site(s) on appropriate eCRFs. 
In addition, the Medical Monitor shall review and make decisions on the disposition of the 
SAE and pregnancy reports received by the DAIT-SACCC (See Section 7.3, Collection and 
Recordi
ng of Adverse Events ).   
 DSMB Review  7.8.2
 Planned DSMB Reviews  7.8.2.1
The Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) shall review safety data at least yearly 
during planned DSMB Data Review Meetings. Data for the planned safety reviews will 
include, at a minimum, a listing of all reported AEs and SAEs.   
The DSMB will be informed of an Expedited Safety Report in a timely manner. 
 Ad hoc  DSMB Reviews  7.8.2.2
In a
ddition to the pre-scheduled data reviews and planned safety monitoring, the DSMB may 
be called upon for ad hoc reviews or emergency meetings (see Section 5.8.3, Safety Stopping 
Clinical Protocol: ALE09  Page 87 of 125 CONFIDENTIAL  
 
 
 
Version 4.0  05 October 2018  
 Guidance ). The DSMB will have the discretion to recommend actions regarding study 
conduct and continuation as a consequence of any planned or unplanned monitoring activity. 
8 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS AND ANALYTICAL PLAN 
8.1 Sample Size and Power 
A total of approximately 100 eligible subjects (approximately 25 per treatment arm) will 
participate in the study.  
The primary hypothesis will be tested using the 3 degree of freedom (df) contrast comparing 
the difference in predicted means from Day 1 to Day 84 for each JBT-101 cohort versus 
pla
cebo, where estimates will be derived from a random regression model (See Section 
8.3.2.1 , Primary Efficacy Analysis ). T he method of Stroup (1999) [ 123] was used to estimate 
power and sample size. To apply the method, we made reasonable assumptions about (1) the 
covariance matrix for the random effects and the residual variance, and (2) mean changes 
over time for each treatment group.   
Subjects who complete the study will have approximately 84 NRS scores assessed daily. To 
derive the within-subject covariance matrix, we need the within-subject correlation matrix 
and the standard deviation.  We assume the daily assessments have an AR(1) within-subject 
correlation structure, which seems reasonable based on preliminary data on 24 subjects 
assessed on days 1, 14, and 28 [ 101]. Based on this preliminary data, the correlation 
coeff
icient for assessments 1 day apart is very high (estimated as 0.9775).   The standard 
deviation (SD) of the NRS is assumed to be the same for each day and likely to be on the 
range from 1.3 to 1.6.  The range is based on a study by Farrar (2001) [ 1 24] that examined 
dat
a from 10 clinical trials including 2724 patients with a variety of conditions characterized 
by chr
onic pain who had baseline pain of ≥ 4 on the NRS.  The study suggests that patient’s 
per
ceptions of pain and improvement is similar and consistent across disease indications. 
Results of this study influenced the recommendations on clinical importance of treatment 
effects on pain in clinical trials authored by The Initiative on Methods, Measurement, and 
Pain Assessment in Clinical Trials (IMMPACT) group [ 125].  
The covar
iance matrix for the 84 repeated NRS measures can be derived assuming an AR(1) 
correlation matrix (r=0.9775 for a 1 day interval) and a choice of SD; we considered the two 
ext
remes in SD = 1 .3 and 1.6, as well as the pooled estimate (1.43) across the 10 studies in 
[124]. The next step was to derive the covariance matrix for the random effects in the random 
regression model (i.e. the subject-level intercepts and slopes). To this end, we simulated day 
0 to 84 data for 10,000 subjects, fit the model with fixed and random subject-level intercepts 
and slopes, and used the output covariance estimates as parameters for power/ sample size 
computation.  Covariance parameters are displayed in Table 5.

We considered several scenarios for mean changes over time.  The IMMPACT group 
suggests that on average decrease of 2 points (~30% improvement on average) on the NRS 
sca
le is consistent with clinically important improvement from the perspective of an 
individual patient, but they did not make a recommendation for clinically relevant mean 
decrease in NRS for a treatment group relative to placebo [ 1 25]. Although a mean decrease 
of
 2 points on the NRS for a treatment group would certainly be important clinically, a 
decrease of a smaller magnitude might also include a substantial number of individual 
subjects who showed improvement of at least 2 points. As such, we considered mean 
decreases, d, ranging from 1.5 to 2.0 points over 84 days and assumed no change for placebo.  
For ea
ch value of d, we present power/sample size calculations for 2 scenarios.  In Scenario 
1, the mean decrease of d is achieved in 1 of the JBT-101 treatment groups.  The other 2 
JBT-
101 groups show mean decreases of 0.5d and 0.25d.  In Scenario 2, two of the JBT-101 
t
reatment groups achieve a mean decrease of d, and the third shows a decrease of 0.25d.  
These scenarios are summarized in Table 6. We also considered a 3rd scenario where all 3 
tr
eatment groups achieved a mean decrease of d, but power estimates were nearly identical to 
Scenar
io 2, and hence, results are not shown.

Using the covariance parameters for pooled, best and worst cases (Table 5) and treatment 
effects for Scenarios 1 and 2 (Table 6), we generated non-centrality parameters for the F 
sta
tistic for evaluating the 3 df test, and computed power according to the method of Stroup 
(1999)
.  Power estimates for a Type 1 error rate = 0.05 and treatment group sizes of 22 and 
25 are displayed in Figure 3. The x axis ranges from 1.5 to 2.0 (i.e. values of d) and 
re
presents the maximum difference between treatment versus placebo for 1 JBT-101 treated 
group
 in Scenario 1 or 2 treated groups in Scenario 2. The y axis displays associated power. 
Clinical Protocol: ALE09  Page 89 of 125 CONFIDENTIAL  
 
 
 
Version 4.0  05 October 2018  
 When 2 JBT-101  treated groups achieve the target treatment effect (Scenario 2), power 
exce
eds 80% for treatment effects of at least 1.6 using the pooled SD with 25 per group 
(
Figure 3a).   These estimates assume complete data for each subject. Given that this study is 
of
 relatively short duration, subject retention is expected to be good with minimal data 
missing. However, if the sample size drops to 22 per group due to missing data or 
withdr
awals, minimum power is still nearly 80%.  If only 1 JBT-101 treated group achieves 
the
 target treatment effect (Scenario 1), then a treatment effect of at least 1.9 would be 
needed for 80% power on the 3 df test. 
This ana
lysis does not take into account that the random regression model will include the 
Screening 7-day average maximum daily pain NRS as a covariate as well as terms for 
quadr
atic trends in time, both of which will account for a fraction of the variance in the NRS 
scores and, hence, may reduce the residual variance and increase power.  Figure 3b shows the 
im
pact of a small reduction in residual variance from 0.49 to 0.41 (Table 5).    For Scenario 
2, power exc
eeds 80% for treatment effects of at least 1.5 with 22 or 25 per group. If only 1 
JBT-101 treated group achieves the target treatment effect (Scenario 1), then a treatment 
eff
ect of at least 1.7 gives power of ~80% or better. 
Figure 3c presents a worst case scenario where the variability associated with the NRS scores 
is hi
gh (SD=1.6).  All power curves drop by about 10 percentage points compared to Figure 
3a.  Under this worst case scenario the study would be under-powered except for Scenario 2 
for treatment effects exceeding 1.8. However, since results from Farrar suggest that patient’s 
per
ceptions of pain and improvement is similar and consistent across disease indications, the 
estimated pooled SD based on over 2000 patients represents a reasonable expectation of the 
“truth” for our study population [ 124]. As such, power estimates in Figure 3a are appropriate 
for thi
s study, and may in fact underestimate power given the enhancements planned for the 
ra
ndom regression model as noted above.  
In ge
neral, power is better when at least 2 of the 3 JBT-101 treatment groups differ 
m
eaningfully from placebo. The study will likely be underpowered if only 1 of the JBT-101 
tr
eatment groups differs meaningfully from placebo unless that difference is relatively large 
(1.9 or higher, Figure 3a), for the first Phase 2 study in this patient population, this risk is 
acc
eptable. Power is expected to be acceptable with ~22 subjects per arm, but if >12% of 
subj
ects who initiate treatment discontinue treatment prematurely, the total sample size may 
be augm
ented to ensure adequate power.

Version 4.0  05 October 2018  
 8.2 Analysis Populations 
 Modified Intent- to-Treat Population  8.2.1
The modified Intent- to-Treat population (mITT) will consist of all randomized subjects who 
have r
eceived at least one dose of study product. The mITT population will be used for all 
eff
icacy analyses and will include subjects under the treatment to which they were 
ra
ndomized, regardless of compliance with assigned treatment.  
 Per Protocol Population 8.2.2
The per protocol population (PP) will consist of mITT subjects who:  
 com plete Visit 3 (Day 29), without missing more than 7 days of study product 
bet
ween Visit 1 (Day 1) through Visit 3 (Day 29).  
 have ≥ 80%  compliance with study drug administration from Visits 1- 5 (Days 1-85), 
as a
ssessed by numbers of capsules of study product returned to the site, excluding 
periods off study drug when directed per protocol by the site investigator or treating 
physician) 
 com plete the study without protocol violations deemed likely to effect the efficacy 
outc
omes of interest 
A masked data review panel will evaluate deviations from the protocol including, for 
example, violations of entry criteria, departures from assigned treatment regimen, 
modifications of concurrent therapy, failure to complete study visits, or administration of 
study procedures outside the specified visit windows to determine if occurrence of these 
deviations should exclude subjects from the PP population. 
The PP population will be used for secondary efficacy. 
 Safety Population 8.2.3
The safety population will include all subjects for whom study treatment is initiated. The 
safety population will be used for all safety analysis. Analysis performed on the safety 
popula
tion will be according to the treatment actually received. 
 PK Population 8.2.4
The PK population will consist of all subjects with at least one valid measure of JBT-101 
pla
sma concentration. Analysis performed on the PK population will be according to the 
treatment actually received. 
8.3 Description of the Analyses 
 All da ta will be provided in data listings sorted by treatment groups, subject number, 
and visit.  
 Summary data will be presented in tabular format by treatment groups.  
Clinical Protocol: ALE09  Page 92 of 125 CONFIDENTIAL  
 
 
 
Version 4.0  05 October 2018  
  Categorical data will be summarized by the number and percentage of subjects in 
each category.  
 Continuous data will be summarized by descriptive statistics including N, mean, 
standard deviation, median, and range.  
 All pe rcentages will be rounded to one decimal place.  
 Diff erences between groups will be calculated as active – placebo and change from 
base
line (Δ NRS ) will be calculated as follow-up visit – baseline.  
 The baseline measure will be defined as the last non-missing measure prior to 
initiation of study product. It is expected that baseline values for efficacy assessments 
will be measured at Visit 1 (Day 1).  
 P -values will be assessed at a 2-sided alpha = 0.05 level for the primary efficacy 
anal
ysis.   
 Secondar y analyses are exploratory and intended to deepen our understanding of risks 
and benefits, to refine hypotheses, and to obtain information from which to design, 
sel
ect doses, and power future pivotal studies.  P-values will be presented for 
sec
ondary efficacy analyses. No adjustments for multiple comparisons are planned 
for secondary anal
yses. 
 Subject Disposition 8.3.1
The disposition of all subjects over the course of the trial will be summarized by cohort and 
overall. The number and percent of subjects in each analysis population (mITT, PP, safety, 
and PK) will be displayed. In addition, the presentation will include the number of subjects 
who co
mpleted the study, the number who withdrew prematurely from the study, as well as 
the
 reason for withdrawal. In addition, the number of subjects who continued treatment to 
Visi
t 5 (Day 85) and who discontinued treatment early will also be summarized along with 
re
asons for discontinuation. 
 Efficacy Analysis 8.3.2
 Primary Efficacy Analysis 8.3.2.1
The primary hypothesis for this study is that JBT-101 treatment will result in improvement in 
the
 maximum daily pain NRS scores in SLE patients with active musculoskeletal disease.  
The null hypothesis to be tested is: 
H0: Linear trends from Day 1 to Day 84 are equivalent for each JBT-101 cohort and placebo. 
HA
: Linear trends from Day 1 to Day 84 are not equivalent across groups. 
In addition, pairwise comparisons of each JBT-101 cohort versus placebo are of key interest. 
For the primary analysis, the maximum daily pain NRS scores from Day 1 through end of 
tr
eatment (typically Day 84) will be modeled using a random regression approach.  The fixed 
Clinical Protocol: ALE09  Page 93 of 125 CONFIDENTIAL  
 
 
 
Version 4.0  05 October 2018  
 effects model will include treatment group, time, time2, time- and time2 by treatment group 
interactions, as well as the Screening 7-day average maximum daily pain NRS as a covariate. 
W
ithin-subject random effects for intercept and slopes for time and time2 will be fit using an 
unst
ructured covariance matrix assuming the same structure for all treatment groups. In the 
event of convergence problems, the covariance structure will be simplified by dropping the 
random effect for time2.  The primary hypothesis will be tested using the 3 degrees of 
freedom contrast comparing the difference in predicted means ( m̂) from Day 1 to Day 84 for 
eac
h JBT-101 group versus placebo. That is, ( m̂84 – m̂1)cohort i - (m̂84 – m̂1)placebo = 0 for i=1 to 3.   
NR
S data up to the day of last dose of study treatment will be included in the analysis for all 
subjects in the mITT population. Any NRS data entered into the IVRS after discontinuation 
of study treatment or entered on days when narcotic analgesics were taken will be excluded.  
If the 3 df test is
 significant, Dunnett’s tests for 1 df pairwise comparisons with placebo are 
planned. If the 3 df test is not statistically significant, confidence intervals for the 1df pair-
wise c
omparisons with placebo will still be presented, but this information will be used for 
hypothesis generation and planning of future studies.   
Clinical Protocol: ALE09  Page 94 of 125 CONFIDENTIAL  
 
 
 
Version 4.0  05 October 2018  
  Secondary Efficacy Analyses 8.3.2.2
Secondary analyses of the longitudinally assessed maximum daily pain NRS scores will 
include: 
 A 1 df  contrast to compare placebo versus the average across all treated groups  
 Analyse s to modify the primary analysis model by replacing treatment group with 
JBT-101 dose, so that dose response may be evaluated  
 Modi fication of the primary random regression model to include interaction terms to 
evaluate the impact of the Screening 7-day average maximum daily pain NRS on 
trends over time 
 Analyse s analogous to the primary analyses using % change in NRS from baseline 
(i.e. where baseline is the Screening 7-day average maximum daily pain NRS) as the 
outcome variable 
 E valuation of persistence in trends after treatment is stopped by  including data after 
day 84 in a new random regression model where slopes are allowed to change after 
thi
s point 
The 7-day average of maximum daily pain NRS scores prior to Visits 1 (Day 1), 3 (Day 29), 
4 (Day 57), 5 (Day 85), and 6 (Day 113) will be used to identify responders whose averages 
im
prove by 30% (or 50%, 75% or 100%) over Visit 1 (Day 1) and to evaluate ordinal 
change
s in pain categories (major improvement, improvement, no change, worsening) from 
Visit 1 (Day 1) to subsequent visits.  Relationships between treatment group and each 
cat
egorical outcome will be evaluated using contingency table analyses. Generalized linear 
models that account for the correlation structure of the data may be used to further explore 
any trends that might be suggested by the stratified analyses.   
Analyse
s plans for other categorical secondary endpoints (e.g. presence/absence of arthritis 
on the SELENA SLEDAI or BILAG scores for the musculoskeletal domain) will be 
analogous to those noted in the previous paragraph. Generally, mixed models will be used to 
evaluate disease activity or patient-reported secondary endpoints that are indices or scores 
assessed  at Visits 1 –  5 (Days 1 –  85). Models will be used to compare trajectories and 
changes in the secondary endpoints over time among the individual JBT-101 groups (Cohort 
1, Cohort 2, and Cohort
 3) and placebo (Cohort 4). Data transformations will be considered, 
as appropriate.  Larger models may be constructed for these comparisons with consideration 
of additional covariates that are found to differ between the treatment groups. Covariates may 
include, but are not limited to: 7-day average of the maximum daily pain NRS score at Visit 
1 (Day 1), Fibromyalgia Symptom Score at Visit 1 (Day 1), gender, age, disease duration, 
and severity.  
 Safety Analyses 8.3.3
 Adverse events 8.3.3.1
Clinical Protocol: ALE09  Page 95 of 125 CONFIDENTIAL  
 
 
 
Version 4.0  05 October 2018  
 Safety will be assessed primarily by summarizing TEAEs, including treatment-emergent 
SAEs, and the proportion of subjects with TEAEs and treatment-emergent SAEs in each 
individual JBT-101 cohort (Cohort 1, Cohort 2, and Cohort 3) to the placebo (Cohort 4). 
For pl
acebo and each JBT-101 cohort, the frequency of AEs and SAEs from Screening 
thr
ough Visit 6 (Day 113) will be summarized by system organ class, preferred term, severity 
(gr
ade), and relationship to study treatment.  
Safety endpoint identified in Section 3.2.3, Safety Endpoints , will be summarized and listed 
sepa
rately.  With the exception of the “psychotropic activity” endpoint, safety endpoints are 
“events”.  For each such endpoint, the number of events and numbers and percentages of 
subjects who experience these events will be summarized for placebo and each individual 
JBT-101 cohort. No formal statistical testing will be performed to compare safety in different 
cohor
ts. 
 Laboratory safety outcomes 8.3.3.2
Results of blood and urine laboratory safety tests, including CBC with cell differential and 
platelets, metabolic panel, and urine tests will be summarized by visit and time point using 
desc
riptive statistics for continuous measures. Changes from Visit 1 (Day 1) will also be 
summ
arized. Shift tables will be presented summarizing the shift from Visit 1 (Day 1) to 
subsequent
 visits. Results will be presented for placebo and each individual JBT-101 cohort.  
 Elect
rocardiograms and QT/QTc intervals 8.3.3.3
The QT/QTc intervals and change from Visit 1 (Day 1) to  subsequent visits will be 
summ
arized by visit using continuous summary statistics for placebo and each individual 
JBT-
101 cohort. 
 ARCI -
M questionnaire 8.3.3.4
ARCI -M questionnaire scores will be summarized by visit for Visits 1 (Day 1) (before and 
after
 first dose of study drug), 3 (Day 29), and 5 (Day 85), and for change from Visit 1 (Day 
1)
 prior to the first dose of study drug to the visit using continuous summary statistics. The 
nu
mber of subjects with an increase in score by ≥ 1 from Visit 1 (Day 1) prior to study 
produc
t administration will be presented by visit for Visit 1 (Day 1) after study drug 
administration, Visits 3 (Day 29) and 5 (Day 85). 
 P
lasma Concentrations of JBT-101 and Metabolites 8.3.4
Result
s of JBT-101 plasma concentrations and metabolites for Visits 1 (Day 1) and Visit 2 
(
Day 15) will be described, using continuous summary statistics, by visit. 
In addition, plasma concentrations will be listed by subject and cohort in a blinded manner, 
using a mock identification number separate from the subject id, at several times during the 
trial to determine whether exposure to JBT-101  in the SLE subjects is within the expected 
Clinical Protocol: ALE09  Page 96 of 125 CONFIDENTIAL  
 
 
 
Version 4.0  05 October 2018  
 range for the doses administered. Complete analyses of the plasma concentrations and 
metabolites will be done at the end of the trial. 
 Mec
hanis tic Analyses 8.3.5
Descr
iptive statistics and plots (including, but not limited to, those described subsequently) 
will be used to gain an understanding of the data prior to developing any statistical models. 
Means, medians, standard deviations, minimums, and maximums will be computed for each 
continuous mechanistic endpoint at each time point for treatment groups and separately for 
subj
ects who do/do not experience clinically significant disease reactivation. Fo r 
dichotomous mechanistic endpoints, frequencies and percent’s will be computed at each time 
point
 for treatment. To gain a better understanding of trends over time, summary statistics 
(e.g., means, medians, or percents) will be plotted versus time at the relevant time points. 
Plots for individual subjects may also be useful. Complete analyses of the mechanistic 
endpoi
nts will be done at the end of the trial and will be described in a statistical analysis 
plan for mechanistic studies. 
8.4 Inte
rim Analysis 
Interim analyses of data will be reported to the DSMB at planned DSMB meetings and as 
requested by the DSMB. Planned interim analyses for the DSMB will focus on study conduct 
and subject safety and may include information on enrollment, randomization, site activation 
status, major protocol deviations, subject status and demographics, and safety analyses. In 
addition, the DSMB may review selected efficacy data. 
No other interim analyses are planned.  
8.5 Ot
her Statistical Considerations 
8.6 Covariate
s 
No specific adjustments for covariates are planned for this study. 
8.7 Multi-center Studies 
No special consideration of site effects is planned. The number of subjects at some study 
sites is expected to be insufficient (< 5 subjects) for evaluation of site effects. In addition, 
because the maximum daily pain NRS is patient-reported rather than physician-assessed, site 
effects would be expected to have a minimal impact on primary endpoint analysis.  
8.8 Multiple Comparisons and Multiplicity 
The primary analysis for the efficacy of JBT-101 compares the individual trajectories of the 4 
cohor
ts over time. Section 8.3.2 describes the use of Dunnett’s test for multiple comparisons 
agai
nst the placebo group. The secondary efficacy analyses will evaluate trends for efficacy, 
with p-values and confidence intervals presented as descriptive measures of strength of 
Clinical Protocol: ALE09  Page 97 of 125 CONFIDENTIAL  
 
 
 
Version 4.0  05 October 2018  
 evidence rather than formal statistical inference. Therefore, no additional multiplicity 
adjustments are needed for this study.  
8.9 Examination of Subgroups 
Exploratory subgroup analyses of efficacy endpoints will be done based on subject Screening 
7-day average of the maximum daily pain NRS score ≤ 6 versus ≥ 7 and Fibromyalgia 
Sy
mptom Scale score < 13 and ≥ 13 at Visit 1 (Day 1).  
8.10 Ch
anges to the Statistical Analysis Plan 
A detailed description of the planned analyses will be provided in a Statistical Analysis Plan 
that will be completed and signed off prior to database lock. Major changes from this 
protocol will be noted in the Statistical Analysis Plan. Changes to the Statistical Analysis 
Plan that are made subsequent to database lock will be documented in the clinical study 
report. 
8.11 Missing Data 
For the primary analysis, a longitudinal mixed model is planned, which will include all 
available data from all subjects in the mITT population regardless of completeness. Because 
this is a short study, data is expected to be missing at random, but any obvious contradictions 
to this assumption will be noted and considered.  Standard procedures will be used to ensure 
tha
t data are as complete and accurate as possible. Generally, missing data will not be 
imputed. Deviations from this approach will be specified in the Statistical Analysis Plan. 
9 ACCESS TO SOURCE DATA AND DOCUMENTS 
Each participating site will maintain the highest degree of confidentiality permitted for the 
clinical and research information obtained from subjects participating in this clinical trial. 
Medical and research records should be maintained at each site in the strictest confidence. 
However, as a part of the quality assurance and legal responsibilities of an investigation, each 
site must permit authorized representatives of the IND sponsor(s), the DAIT-SACCC, 
Corbus Pharmaceuticals Holdings, Inc., and health authorities to examine (and when required 
by applicable law, to copy) clinical records for the purposes of quality assurance reviews, 
audits, and evaluation of the study safety and progress. Unless required by the laws 
per
mitting copying of records, only the coded identity associated with documents or other 
subject data may be copied (obscuring any personally identifying information). Authorized 
re
presentatives as noted above are bound to maintain the strict confidentiality of medical and 
research information that may be linked to identified individuals. Participating sites will 
norm
ally be notified in advance of auditing visits. 
All subject records and study documentation will be kept after the protocol is completed. 
This will include all documentation of AEs, records of study drug receipt and dispensation, 
and all IRB correspondence. All study records will be kept for at least two  years after the 
investigation is completed. 
Clinical Protocol: ALE09  Page 98 of 125 CONFIDENTIAL  
 
 
 
Version 4.0  05 October 2018  
 10 DATA COLLECTION, QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY 
ASSURANCE 
The investigator is required to keep accurate records to ensure the conduct of the study is 
fully documented. The period of record retention should be consistent with the record 
retention policies of the sponsoring agency or applicable regulatory agencies. However, in 
certain instances, documents should be retained for a longer period if required by the 
applicable regulatory agency or by the National Institutes of Health. 
The investigator will report all major protocol deviations to DAIT and the DAIT-SACCC per 
the
 instructions in the Autoimmunity Centers of Excellence (ACE) Manual of Procedures. 
The DAIT-SACCC will forward reports of protocol deviations to the responsible 
DAIT/NIAID medical officer for review as specified in the Manual of Procedures. 
The DAIT-SACCC is responsible for regular inspection of the conduct of the trial, for 
ver
ifying adherence to the protocol, and for confirming the completeness, consistency, and 
accuracy of all documented data. 
Data will be obtained from a variety of sources including, but not limited to laboratory 
notebooks, automated instrument output files, and clinical subject charts. Data from these 
source materials will be transmitted to the DAIT-SACCC via one of two mechanisms. Data 
collected electronically at central laboratories will be transferred electronically directly from 
the laboratory to the DAIT-SACCC using standard secure data transfer procedures. Data 
collected at the clinical sites will be transmitted to the DAIT-SACCC using an internet-based 
re
mote data entry system. Clinical site personnel use an internet browser to key data into 
eCRFs; each CRF page is submitted to the clinical database electronically as the page is 
completed. Univariate data validation tests are performed as the data are keyed. The clinical 
database is backed up nightly; backup tapes are saved in a secure, off-site location. At any 
time, authorized site personnel may log in to the remote data entry system, review and 
correct previously entered data, or key additional data. The data will be further validated per 
the study data validation plan via a series of computerized and manual edit checks, and all 
relevant data queries will be raised and resolved on an ongoing basis. Complete, clean data 
will be frozen to prevent further inadvertent modifications. All discrepancies will be 
reviewed and any resulting queries will be resolved with the investigators and amended in the 
database. All elements of data entry (i.e., time, date, verbatim text, and the person performing 
the data entry) will be recorded in an electronic audit trail to allow all data changes in the 
database to be monitored and maintained in accordance with federal regulations. 
The DAIT-SACCC will periodically visit the participating clinical sites and audit the source 
documents in order to validate the data in the DAIT-SACCC central database. Data will be 
provided using the subject’s screening or enrollment number, the DAIT-SACCC will not 
collect personally identifying information such as the subject’s name or social security 
number. Subjects will provide demographic information such as race, ethnicity, and birth

Version 4.0  05 October 2018  
 11 ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS AND COMPLIANCE WITH GOOD 
CLINICAL PRACTICE 
The study will be conducted according to GCP guidelines, U.S. 21 CFR Part 50 – Protection 
of
 Human Subjects, and Part 56 – Institutional Review Boards. 
11.1 Compli
ance with Good Clinical Practices 
This trial will be conducted in compliance with the protocol, current GCPs recommended by 
the ICH and the applicable regulatory requirements for participating institutions. These 
include the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki and review and approval by the appropriate 
ethics review committee or IRBs of participating organizations. The DAIT-SACCC will 
assure compliance through a program of quality assurance audits performed both at 
participating sites and within the DAIT-SACCC for data quality and adherence to protocol 
requirements. The DAIT-SACCC is operated by Rho Federal Systems Division, Inc. 
(RhoFED
), Chapel Hill, North Carolina under a cooperative agreement with NIAID. 
11.2 Institutional Review Board 
Each participating institution must provide for the review and approval of this protocol and 
associated informed consent documents by an appropriate ethics review committee or IRB. 
Any amendments to the protocol or consent materials must be approved by the IRB before 
they are placed into use. In both the United States and in other countries, only institutions 
holding a current Federal Wide Assurance issued by the Office of Human Research 
Protection (OHRP) at the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) may 
participate. 
The investigator will inform the IRB of serious or unexpected AEs that might occur during 
the study and are likely to affect the safety of the subjects, or the conduct of the study. The 
investigators will comply fully with all IRB requirements for both the reporting of AEs, 
protocol or consent form changes, as well as any new information pertaining to the use of the 
study medication that might affect the conduct of the study. 
11.3 Informed Consent 
 The principles of informed consent in the current edition of the Declaration of Helsinki, as 
well
 as compliance with all IRB requirements, will be implemented in the study, before any 
protocol-specified procedures are carried out. A standard consent form for subject 
participation will be provided with the protocol to each institution. Any modifications to the 
standard information in the template will require review and approval by DAIT/NIAID. 
Informed consent will be obtained in accordance with 21 CFR 50.52. Information may be 
given to subjects in oral, written, or video form by the investigator. All prospective subjects 
will be given ample time to read the consent form, and ask questions, before signing. 
If subjects are to be enrolled who do not speak and read English, the consent materials must 
be translated into the language appropriate for the enrolling subject. Translated documents 
Clinical Protocol: ALE09  Page 100 of 125 CONFIDENTIAL  
 
 
 
Version 4.0  05 October 2018  
 must be certified to contain the complete descriptions provided in the English version of the 
document. If an interpreter is used to provide or assist in describing the consent materials to 
an enrolling subject, the interpreter must also sign the consent materials certifying their 
involvement with the consent process. 
After completion, a copy of the signed consent form will be given to the subject. The original 
signed consent form will be kept on file in the subject’s study chart, available for inspection 
by regulatory authorities, both federal and institutional. 
11.4 Data and Safety Monitoring Board 
The responsibility for reviewing the ethical conduct of the study and for monitoring reports 
of evidence of adverse or beneficial effect is assigned to the DAIT Autoimmunity DSMB. 
The DSMB is an independent group composed of biomedical ethic experts, physicians, and 
other scientists who are responsible for continuing review of study information. The DSMB 
m
akes recommendations to DAIT/NIAID on issues affecting the course and conduct of this 
clinical study. 
11.5 Study Termination 
In the event that the study is discontinued, sites will immediately notify subjects to terminate 
study agent and return for a close-out visit to the site within 30 days.  
12 FINANCING AND INSURANCE 
Participating institutions must comply with their institution’s policies on compensation, 
insurance, and indemnity. Institutions must have adequate liability insurance coverage to 
satisfy their local and national requirements for study participation. 
13 PUBLICATION POLICY 
The Autoimmunity Centers of Excellence (ACE) policy on publication of study results will 
apply to this study. Authorized participants may find details regarding the policy statement 
on the ACE internet website at http://www.rhoworld.com . Study investigators are 
encouraged to communicate and publish study results with prior notification of DAIT, 
NIAID, and Corbus Pharmaceuticals Holdings, Inc. The following procedure is suggested: 
1. Manuscripts, abstracts, posters and other material for public distribution will be 
submitted to DAIT, NIAID, and Corbus Pharmaceuticals Holdings, Inc. at least 30 
days prior to submission for publication or public presentation. 
2. DA IT, NIAID, and Corbus Pharmaceuticals Holdings, Inc. will review and comment 
on the
 proposed material within 30 days. 
3. DA IT, NIAID, and/or Corbus Pharmaceuticals Holdings, Inc. may ask that 
confident
ial information be deleted or redacted in this case where a patent may be 
filed or where confidential information is involved. Publication or presentation may 
be del
ayed up to 60 additional days in order to file a patent application.

 14 APPENDICES 
14.1 Ap pendix A: Reproductive Potential and Effective Methods of Contraception 
Women are considered to have “no reproductive potential” if they meet any one of the following criteria:  
 Hysterectomy 
 Bilateral oophorectomy 
 Bilateral salpingectomy, or 
 Post-menopausal with no menses for 12 months without an alternative medical cause. A high 
follicle stimulating hormone in the postmenopausal range can be used to confirm a post-
menopausal state in women not using hormonal contraception or hormonal replacement therapy. 
In the absence of 12 months of amenorrhea, a single follicle stimulating hormone measurement is 
insufficient.  
Highly effective methods of birth control are those that result in a low failure rate (i.e., less than 1 percent 
per year) when used consistently and correctly. Examples of highly reliable method of birth control when 
used consistently and correctly are given: 
 Combined (estrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception associated with 
inhibition of ovulation  
o Oral 
o Intravaginal 
o Transdermal 
 Progestogen-only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation  
o Oral 
o Injectable  
o Implantable  
 Intrauterine device  
 Intrauterine hormone-releasing system  
 Bilateral tubal occlusion  
 Vasectomised partner  
Other acceptable method of birth control: 
 Double barrier (male condom with or without spermicide used in combination with a diaphragm 
or cervical cap with spermicide)  
 Sexual abstinence. Abstinence is only acceptable when this is the preferred and usual life style of 
the individual.  
Periodic abstinence (calendar, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods), withdrawal (coitus interruptus) 
and lactational amenorrhea method are not acceptable means of contraception.

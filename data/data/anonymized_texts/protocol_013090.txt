1. SYNOPSIS  
Title of study:  A Phase 2, Open-Label, Multiple-Dose Study to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability, 
Pharmacokinetics, and Pharmacodynamics of NBI -74788 in Adult Subjects with Congenital Adrenal 
Hyperplasia  
Study  number:  NBI-74788-CAH2001 
Study center(s):  Approximately 7 study centers in North America  
Objectives:  
• To assess the safety and tolerability of different dosing regimens of NBI -74788 in adult 
subjects with congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH).  
• To evaluate the effect of repeated doses of NBI -74788 on endogenous levels of 
pharmacodynamic (PD) biomarkers in adult subjects with CAH.  
• To evaluate the impact of different dosing regimens of NBI-74788 on endogenous levels of 
PD biomarkers.  
• To evaluate plasma exposures following repeated doses of NBI -74788. 
Methodology:  This is a Phase 2, open- label, multiple -dose, dose- escalation study to assess the 
safety, toler ability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and PD of NBI -74788 in approximately 30 adult female 
and male subjects (18 to 50 years of age) with a documented medical diagnosis of classic 
21-hydroxylase deficiency CAH.  The study will include a sequential-cohort design with 
4 NBI -74788 dosing regimens, with each regimen  administered for 14 consecutive days: 
• Cohort 1:  NBI-74788 50 mg once daily with a bottle of vanilla-flavored  
(~237 mL) a t
 approximately 2200 hours. 
• Cohort 2:  NBI-74788 100 mg once daily with a bottle of vanilla -flavored  
(~237 mL) a t
 approximately 2200 hours. 
• Cohort 3:  NBI-74788 100 mg once daily with the evening meal at approximately 1900 hours. 
• Cohort 4:  NBI -74788 100 mg twice daily with breakfast at approximately 0700 hours and 
with the evening meal at approximately 1900 hours. 
There will be an approximate 2 -week period to evaluate safety and tolerability data before proceeding 
from  Cohort 1 to Cohort 2.  Subjects who previously completed the current study in Cohort 1 or 
Cohort 2 may reenroll to participate in Cohorts 3 or 4 (in addition to new subjects) .  The following 
table depicts the cohorts, doses,  and number of subjects per cohort: 
Cohort  NBI-74788 Dose  Approximate Dosing 
Time (s) Number of Subjects  
1 50 mg  2200 hours  8-10 
2  100 mg  2200 hours  8-10 
3 100 mg  1900 hours  8-10 
4 100 mg  0700 and 1900 hours  Up to 8  
Subjects must provide informed consent prior to any study- related procedures.  Subjects will then be 
screened  for eligibility to participate in the study for up to approximately 3 weeks (Days -28 to -8).  
Subjects who reenroll and have had a stable medication regimen for CAH since their last visit in this 
study do not have to undergo screening; those who reenroll and have had a change to their medication 
regimen for CAH must undergo a second screening  visit.  During screening, subjects will provide a 
single blood sample in the morning between 0700 and 1000 hours (prior to first morning dose of 
hydrocortisone) to determine their 17-hydroxyprogesterone (17- OHP) levels fo r study entry.

Eligible subjects who have a screening  17-OHP level ≥1,000 ng/dL will be admitted to the study 
center for 1 night and have baseline serial PD samples collected over a 24 -hour period beginning  in 
the evening of Day -7.  Baseline serial PD samples will be collected at approximately 2145, 2300, 
2400, 0100, 0200, 0400, 0600, 0800, 1000, 1200, 1400, 1800, and 2200 hours for Cohorts 1 and 2 and 
at approximately 1845, 2000, 2100, 2200, 2300, 2400, 0100, 0200, 0400, 0600, 0800, 1000, 1200, 
1400, 1800, 1900, and 2200 hours for Cohorts 3 and 4.  The subjects’ usual morning dose of steroidal 
treatments will be administered after the 1000  hours PD sample is collected on Day -6.  Subjects will 
be discharged  on Day  -6 after the last PD sample is collected.  
Subjects in Cohorts 1 and 2 will be admitted to the study center on Day s 1 and 14 (first and last day of 
dosing).  Subjects will have a blood sample collected on Day 1 for  
  Baseline safety assessments will be collected on Day 1 prior to the first dose of study 
drug.  Study drug (NBI-74788 50 mg  or 100 mg) will be administered at approximately 2200 hours.  
The subjects’ usual morning dose of concurrent steroidal treatments will be administered after the 12-hour postdose PK/PD samples are collected (ie, at approximately 1000 hours) on Day 2 and after 
the 16-hour postdose PK/PD sample s are collected (ie, at approximately 1400 hours) on Day  15.  
Subjects will be discharged from the study center the evening on Days 2 and 15 following completion of all study- related procedures for those days.  Prior to this discharge on Day 2, study drug will be 
administered at the study center at approximately 2200 hours.  Study drug will then be self-administered nightly at home at approximately 2200 hours on Days 3 to 13.  Subjects will take  
their usual morning dose of concurrent steroidal treatments at approximately 1000 hours on Days 3 to 
14.  On Day 7 during the treatment period, PK, PD, and safety assessments will be conducted in an 
outpatient setting at the study center.  
Subjects  in Cohorts 3 and 4 will have a blood sample collected on Day 1 for  
(only for subjects who have not previously participated in Cohorts 1 or 2) .  Baseline safety 
assessments will be collected on Day 1 prior to the first dose of study drug.  For Cohort 3, study drug 
(NBI -74788 100 mg) will be administered at home on Days 1 to 13 at approximately 1900 hours with 
each subject’s evening meal.  For Cohort 4, study drug (NBI-74788 100 mg) will be administered at home on Days 2 to 14 at approximately 0700 hours with each subject’s breakfast and on Days 1 to 13 
at ap proximately 1900 hours with each subjects’ evening meal.  For both cohorts, the Day 14 evening 
dose will be administered at the study site.  Subjects will take their usual morning dose of concurrent 
steroidal treatments at approximately 1000 hours on Days 1 to 14.  On Day 7 during the treatment 
period, PK, PD, and safety assessments will be conducted in an outpatient setting at the study center.  
Subjects will be admitted to the study center on Day 14 (last day of dosing).  On Day  14, subjects will 
receive study drug in the study center at approximately 1900 hours with a standard (moderate 
fat/moderate calorie) evening meal.  The subjects’ usual morning dose of concurrent steroidal 
treatments will be administered after PK/PD samples are collected at approximately 1400 hours on 
Day 15.  Subjects will be discharged from the study center the evening on Day 15 following 
completion of all study- related procedures.    
For all cohorts, f ollow -up visits on Days 21 , 28, and 35 will be conducted at the study center or the 
subject’s home by a qualified home healthcare provider (bas ed on the subject’s preference).  A final 
study visit will be conducted at the study site approximately 5 weeks after the last dose of study drug 
(on Day 49 or early termination).  There will be a visit window of - 8 hours for day  7, -8 hours/ +3 days 
for Day s 21, 28, and 35, and +7 days for the final study visit.  Safety, tolerability, PK, and PD will be 
assessed at scheduled times throughout the study.  
Dose Escalation Procedure  
Cohort 1 will consist of approximately 8 to 10 subjects who will receive  a daily dose of NBI-74788 
50 mg at approximately 2200 hours for 14 days  (subjects will receive study drug at the site on Days 1, 
2, and 14, and self-administer study drug at home on Days 3 to 13) .  Following the completion of 
Day 15 assessments for all subjects in Cohort 1 , a medical monitor will review the accumulated safety

and tolerability results to ensure there are no safety concerns with proceeding to the 100 mg dose 
(Cohorts 2 and 3), a nd to determine if a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) has been reached.  If the 
MTD is reached, no dose escalation will occur.  There will be an approximate 2 -week period between 
Cohorts 1 and 2 to accommodate this safety review.   A similar procedure will be u sed prior to 
proceeding to the 100 mg twice daily dose (Cohort 4). 
If the medical monitor determines that it is safe to proceed to NBI-74788 100 mg , subjects in Cohort 2 
will be administered NBI-74788 100 mg daily for 14 days.  Dosing for Cohorts 3 and 4 may begin 
simultaneously with Cohort 2. 
During the 14-day dosing period for any cohort, dosing may be postponed or halted if one or more 
subjects experience a severe or serious adverse event (AE), or if the type, frequency, or severity of 
AEs becomes unacceptable.  If dosing is postponed, the medical monitor will review all available 
safety, tolerability, and PK data before allowing any further subjects to receive study drug.   
Study Population:   Approximately  30 adult female and male subjects (18 to 50 years of age) with a 
documented medical diagnosis of classic 21 -hydroxylase deficiency CAH , who meet all protocol 
eligibility criteria, will be enrolled.   Subjects who previously completed the current  study in Cohort 1 
or Cohort 2 may reenroll to participate in Cohorts 3 or 4 (in addition to new subjects) . 
Duration of treatment:  The expected duration of study participation for each subject is 
approximately 11 weeks, including up to approximately 3 weeks for screening, a 24-hour PD baseline 
period (approximately 7 days prior to the first day of dosing), 14 days of dosing, and a follow-up 
period of approximately 5 weeks.   The total duration of the study will be an additional 8 to 11 weeks 
for subjects who reenroll. 
Test product, dose, and mode of administration:  NBI -74788 will be supplied as capsules 
containing 50 mg of NBI-74788  for oral administration.  Doses of NBI -74788 are 50 mg and 
100 mg, administered in oral capsule form.  Each dose of study drug for Cohorts 1 and 2 is to be 
administered with a bottle of vanilla -flavored  (~237 mL) at approximately 2200 hours.  
Each dose  o
f study drug for Cohort 3 is to be administered with each subject’s evening meal at 
approximately 1900 hours.   Each dose of study drug for Cohort 4 is to be administered with each 
subject’s breakfast at approximately 0700 hours and evening meal at approximately 1900 hours ( ie, a 
total daily dose of 200 mg). 
Reference therapy, dose, and mode of administration:  Not applicable.

4. INTRODUCTION 
4.1. Background  
NBI-74788 is a selective corticotropin releasing factor 1 (CRF1) receptor antagonist that is being 
developed by NBI as a novel oral treatment for classic congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) due to 21- hydro xylase deficiency, a condition that results in little or no cortisol biosynthesis.  One 
clinical manifestation of the absence of cortisol is the lack of feedback inhibition of pituitary adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) secretion.  Increased ACTH levels cause adrenal hyperplasia and the enzyme mutation causes a shunting of cortisol precursor steroids to alternate 
pathways.  Most notably, the shunting of androgens leads to virilization and other developmental 
complications in females and the over- accumulati on of ACTH is associated with the formation 
of testicular adrenal rest tumors in males.  In addition, since the same enzyme (21 -hydroxylase) 
is used in the pathway for the biosynthesis of the mineralocorticoids, a number of these patients suffer from aldos terone deficiency which can result in dehydration and death due to salt-wasting.  
The prevalence of classic 21 -hydroxylase deficiency CAH in the US general population, based 
on newborn screening, has been documented as 1:10,000 to 1:20,800 ( Trakakis et al. , 2010; 
Hertzberg et al., 2011), a figure that suppor
 ts orphan drug designation. 
Pediatric patients from birth through adolescence, and females in particular, appear to be the 
most vulnerable population of CAH sufferers and represent the subgroup of patients with the 
greatest unmet medical need ( Cheng and Speiser, 
2012; Merke and Poppas, 2013).  Excessive 
androgen production in t
hese younger patients results in early onset puberty and adrenarche, 
changes in skeletal maturation patterns, short stature caused  by premature growth plate fusion, as 
well as significant hirsutism and acne problems.  While survival is properly ensured through steroid replacement strategies based on physiologic dosing of glucocorticoids (eg, 
hydrocortisone) and mineralocorticoids (eg, fludrocortisone), these doses are often inadequate to

AH.  The study will include a sequential -cohort design with 4 NBI-74788 dosing 
regimens, with each regimen administered for 14 consecutive days: 
• Cohort 1:  NBI-74788 50 mg once daily with a bottle of vanilla-flavored  
(~237 mL) at
 approximately 2200 hours. 
• Cohort 2:  NBI-74788 100 mg once daily with a bottle of vanilla-flavored  
(~237 mL) at
 approximately 2200 hours. 
• Cohort 3:  NBI-74788 100 mg once daily with the evening meal at approximately 
1900 hours. 
• Cohort 4:  NBI-74788 100 mg twice daily with breakfast at approximately 0700 hours and with the evening meal at approximately 1900 hours.   
There will be an approximate 2 -week period to evaluate safety and tolerability data before 
proceeding from Cohort 1 to Cohort 2.  Subjects who previously completed the current study in 
Cohort 1 or Cohort 2 may reenroll to participate in Cohorts 3 or 4 (in addition to new subjects).  
Table 1 depicts the cohorts, doses, and number of subjects per cohort.

Subjects must provide informed consent prior to any study- related procedures .  Subjects will 
then be screened for eligibility to participate in the study for up to approximately 3 weeks 
(Days  -28 to - 8).  Subjects who reenroll and have had a stable medicat ion regimen for CAH since 
their last visit in this study do not have to undergo screening; those who reenroll and have had a change to their medication regimen for CAH must undergo a second screening visit.  During screening, subjects will provide a single  blood sample in the morning between 0700 and 1000 
hours (prior to first morning dose of hydrocortisone) to determine their 17 -OHP levels for study 
entry.     
Eligible subjects who have a screening 17-OHP level ≥1,000 ng/dL will be admitted to the study 
center for 1 night and have baseline serial PD samples collected over a 24 -hour period beginning 
in the evening of Day - 7.  Baseline serial PD samples will be collected at approximately 2145, 
2300, 2400, 0100, 0200, 0400, 0600, 0800, 1000, 1200, 1400, 1800, a nd 2200 hours for 
Cohorts 1 and 2 and at approximately 1845, 2000, 2100, 2200, 2300, 2400, 0100, 0200, 0400, 
0600, 0800, 1000, 1200, 1400, 1800, 1900, and 2200 hours for Cohorts 3 and 4.  The subjects’ usual morning dose of steroidal treatments will be administered after the 1000 hours PD sample 
is collected on Day -6.  Subjects will be discharged on Day - 6 after the last PD sample is 
collected.  
Subjects in Cohorts 1 and 2 will be admitted to the study center on Days 1 and 14 (first and last 
day of dosing).  Subjects will have a blood sample collected on Day 1 for .

Baseline sa
fety assessments will be collected on Day 1 prior to the first dose of study drug.  
Study drug (NBI -74788 50 or 100 mg) will be administered at approximately 2200 hours.  The 
subjects’ usual morning dose of concurrent steroidal treatments will be administered after the 
12-hour postdose PK/PD samples are collected (ie, at approximately 1000 hours) on Day 2 and 
after the 16 -hour postdose PK/PD samples are collected (ie, at approximately 1400 hours) on 
Day 15.  Subjects will be discharged from the study center the evening on Days 2 and 15 
following completion of all study -related procedures for those days.  Prior to this discharge on 
Day 2, study drug will be administe red at the study center at approximately 2200 hours.  Study 
drug will then be self-administered nightly at home at approximately 2200 hours on Days 3 to 13.  Subjects will take their usual morning dose of concurrent steroidal treatments at 
approximately 1000 hours on Days 3 to 14.  On Day 7 during the treatment period, PK, PD, and 
safety assessments will be conducted in an outpatien t setting at the study center.  
Subjects in Cohorts 3 and 4 will have a blood sample collected on Day 1 for  
 (only for subjects who have not previously participated in Cohorts 1 or 2) .  Baseline 
safety assessments will be collected on Day 1 prior to the first dose of study drug.  For Cohort 3, study drug (NBI-74788 100 mg) will be administered at home on Days 1 to 13 at approximately 
1900 hours with each subject’s evening meal.  For Cohort 4, study drug (NBI-74788 100 mg) 
will be administered at home on Days 2 to 14 at approximately 0700 hours with each subject’s breakfast and on Days 1 to 13 at approximately 1900 hours with each subjects’ evening meal.  
For both cohorts, the Day 14 evening dose will be administered at the study site.  Subjects will 
take their usual morning dose of concurrent steroidal treatments at approximately 1000 hours on Days 1 to 14.  On Day 7 during the treatment period, PK, PD, and safety assessments will be 
conducted in an outpatient setting at the study center.  Subjects will be admitted to the study 
center on Day 14 (last day of dosing).  On Day 14, subjects will receive study drug in the study center at approximately 1900 hours with a standard (moderate fat/moderate calorie) evening 
meal.  The subjects’ usual morning dose of concurrent steroidal treatments will be administered 
after PK/PD samples are collected at approximately 1400 hours on Day 15.  Subjects will be 
discharged from the study center the evening on Day 15 following completion of all study-
related procedures.   
Standard meals and snacks will be provided by the study cente r during the in -patient stays.  
For all cohorts, follow-up visits on Days 21, 28, and 35 will be conducted at the study center or 
the subject’s home by a qualified home healthcare provider (based on the subject’s preference).  
A final study visit will be conducted at the study site approximately 5 weeks after the last dose of 
study drug (on Day 49 or early termination).  There will be a visit window of -8 hours for 
Day 7, -8 hours/+3 days for Days 21, 28, and  35, and +7 days for the final study visit.  Safety, 
tolerability, PK, and PD will be assessed at schedu led times throughout the study.

6.2. Dose Escalation Procedure  
Cohort 1 will consist of approximately 8 to 10 subjects who will receive a daily dose of 
NBI-74788 50 mg at approximately 2200 hours for 14 days (subjects will receive study drug at 
the site on Days 1, 2, and 14, and self-administer study drug at home on Days 3 to 13).  
Following the completion of Day 15 assessments for all subjects in Cohort 1, a medical monitor 
will review the accumulated safety and tolerability results to ensure there are no safety concerns with proceeding to the 100 mg dose (Cohorts 2 and 3), and to determine if a maximum tolerated 
dose (MTD) has been reach ed.  If the MTD is reached, no dose escalation will occur.  There will 
be an approximate 2 -week period between Cohorts 1 and 2 to accommodate this safety review.   
A similar procedure will be used prior to proceeding to the 100 mg twice daily dose (Cohort 4).  
If the medical monitor determines that it is safe to proceed to NBI-74788 100 mg, subjects in 
Cohort 2 will be administered NBI -74788 100 mg daily for 14 days.  Dosing for Cohorts 3 and  4 
may begin simultaneously with Cohort 2. 
During the 14-day dosing period for any  cohort, dosing may be postponed or halted if one or 
more subjects experience a severe or serious adverse event (AE), or if the type, frequency, or 
severity of AEs becomes unacceptable.  If dosing is postponed, the medical monitor will review all available safety, tolerability, and PK data before allowing any further subjects to receive study drug.

screening and urine pregnancy tests will be conducted on Day -7, prior to dosing on Day 1 (for eligibility), Day 14, and at the final study visit (Day 49 or early termination).  For subjects who 
do not undergo screening, serum pregnancy tests (β-hCG) will be conducted on Day -7 and urine pregnancy tests will be conducted prior to dosing on Day 1 (for eligibility), Day 14, and at the final study visit (Day 49 or early termination).  
For any abnormal tests deemed clinically significant, repeat analysis will be conducted until the cause of the abnormality is determined or until the value returns to baseline (or within normal limits), or the investigator deems the a bnormality to be of no clinical significance. 
At any time during the study, an in -home service (phlebotomist) may be available under certain 
circumstances for blood draws. 
8.5.5. Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale 
The Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) is a clinician -rated tool desi
 gned to assess the 
severity of psychopathology in patients with schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders 
(Overall and Gorha
m, 1962, 1988).  The BPRS includes 18 items that address somatic concern, 
anxiety, emot
ional withdrawal, concep tual disorganization, guilt feelings, tension, mannerisms 
and posturing, grandiosity, depressive mood, hostility, suspiciousness, hallucinatory behaviors, motor retardation, uncooperativeness, unusual though content, blunt affect, excitement, and disorientation.  The severity of each of the 18 items of the BPRS is rated on a scale of 1 (not 
present) to 7 (extremely severe) (total score range:  18 to 126).  Higher scores represent greater 
symptom severity.  
The investigator or
 other qualified site personnel w ill administer and score the BPRS 
pre-evening dose on Day s 1 and 14, on Days 2 (Cohorts 1 and 2 only) and 15, and at the final 
study visit (Day 49 or early termination).  A copy of the BPRS is provided in Appendix A . 
8.5.6. Columbia -Suicide Severity Rating Scale  
The C -SSRS is a validated instrument to prospectively assess suicidal ideation and behavior 
(http://www.cssrs.columbia.edu).  There are versions of t he questionnaire designed for use at 
screening (Screening/Baseline version) and at visits throughout the study (Since Last Visit 
version).  All versions of the C- SSRS include a series of screening questions related to suicidal 
ideation and suicidal behavior.  Subject responses of ‘yes’ to one or more screening questions 
will prompt additional questions that evaluate frequency and intensity of suicidal ideation and/or behavior.  Subjects with any suicidal behavior or suicidal ideation of type 4 (active suici dal 
ideation with some intent to act, without specific plan) or type 5 (active suicidal ideation with specific plan and intent) in the past 6 months before screening based on the C- SSRS should be 
excluded (see exclusion criterion #20).

The C -SSRS wi
ll be administered and scored by the investigator or other qualified site personnel 
who completed C- SSRS certification.  The C -SSRS will be administered at screening, during 
PD baseline (only for subjects who reenroll and who do not undergo screening), Day  1, Day 15, 
and at the final study visit (Day 49 or early termination).  The “Screening /Baseline ” version of 
the scale will be used to evaluate subject elig ibility at screening  (or at PD baseline for subjects  in 
Cohorts 3 and 4 who do not undergo screening) and the “Since Last Visit” version will be used at 
all other times.  
A copy of both versions of the C-SSRS are provided in Appendix B .

and documented.  Th
e designated pharmacist or qualified personnel will be responsible for 
maintaining accurate records of the quantity and dates of all study drug supplies received, 
dispensed, and returned.   
The exact time of med ication dosing will be recorded on the eCRF. 
10. ADVERSE EVENTS  
All AEs, whether observed by the investigator, reported by the subject, noted from laboratory 
findings, or by other means, will be recorded from the time the subject has signed the ICF until the subject’s final study visit.  
10.1. Definition  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether 
or not considered drug related.  During the study, clinically significant adverse changes in 
clinical status, ECGs, labora tory values (not associated with an AE or concurrent medical 
condition), or physical examinations are considered AEs.  Any subject complaint associated with such an abnormal finding will also be reported as an AE. 
AEs include, but are not limited to:  (1) a worsening or change in nature, severity, or frequency 
of conditions present at the start of the study; (2) subject deterioration due to primary illness; (3) intercurrent illness; and (4) drug interaction. 
All suicidal behaviors and clinically significant suicidal ideations will be documented as an AE. 
Subjects should be questioned in a general way, without asking about the occurrence of any 
specific symptom.  The investigator should attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on 
signs, symptoms, and/or other clinical information.  In such cases, the diagnosis should be documented as the AE and not the individual signs/symptoms.  Following questioning and 
evaluation, all AEs, whether believed by the investigator to be related or unrelated to the study 
drug, must be documented in the subject’s medical records, in accordance with the investigator’s normal clinical practice and on the AE eCRF.  Each AE is to be evaluated for duration, intensity, frequency, seriousness, outcome, other actions taken, and relationship to the study drug.  
The following are not considered AEs: 
• Continuous persistent disease/symptom present before drug administration, unless it 
unexpectedly progresses, or increases in severity following drug administration. 
• Pregnancy.  
10.2. Intensity of Adverse Events  
AEs must be graded for intensity.  An intensity category of mild, moderate, or severe, as defined 
in Table 4, must be entered on the AE eCRF.  It should be noted that the term “severe” used to 
grade intensity is not synonymous with the term “serious.”

therapeutic intervention.  The event does not generally interfere with usual activities 
of daily living.  
Moderate  An AE that is usually alleviated with additional specific therapeutic intervention.  
The event interfer es with usual activities of daily living, causing discomfort but 
poses no significant or permanent risk of harm to the research participant.  
Severe  An AE that interrupts usual activities of daily living, or significantly affects clinical 
status, or may re quire intensive therapeutic intervention.  
10.3. Relationship to Study Drug  
The investigator will document his/her opinion of the relationship of the AE to treatment with 
study drug using the criteria outlined in Table 5.  An AE is deemed associated with the use of the 
study drug “if there is a reasonable possibility that the drug caused the AE” (otherwise referred 
to as a suspected adverse reaction).  Reasonab le possibility means there is evidence to suggest a 
causal relationship between the drug and the AE (Title 21 CFR 312.32 [a]). 
Table 5: Relationship of Adverse Events to Study Drug  
Relationship  Description  
Definite  A reaction that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the drug or in 
which the drug level has been established in body fluids or tissue; that follows a known or 
expected response pattern to the suspected drug; and that is confirmed b y improvement on 
stopping or reducing the dosage of the drug, and reappearance of the reaction on repeated 
exposure.  
Possible  An AE in which there is reasonable possibility that the drug caused the event.  Reasonable 
possibility means there is evidence to  suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the 
AE. 
Unlikely  A reaction that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the drug; that 
follows a known or suspected response pattern to the suspected drug; but that could 
reasonabl y be explained by known characteristics of the subject’s clinical state.  
Not Related  Any event that does not meet the above criteria.  
10.4. Recording Adverse Events  
For enrolled  subjects, each AE will be listed as a separate entry on an AE eCRF.  Screen failure 
subjects will have AE information noted in the source documentation.  The investigator (or 
designee) will provide information on dates and times of onset and resolution, intensity, 
seriousness, frequency, action(s) taken, changes in study drug usage, relationship to study drug, and outcome. 
The following categories of medical events that could occur during participation in a clinical 
study must be reported within 24 hours to NBI or its designee: 
• SAE, including death ( Section  10.6).  
• Pregnancy (Section  10.7).

• Events of sui
cidal behavior or suicidal ideation type 4 (active suicidal ideation with some 
intent to act, without specific plan) or type 5 (active suicidal ideation with specific plan and 
intent) based on the C- SSRS.  
10.5. Post-Study Follow- Up of Adverse Events  
All AEs, including clinically significant changes in ECGs, physical examination findings, or isolated clinically significant laboratory findings must be followed until the event resolves, the condition stabilizes, the event is otherwise explained, or the subject is lost to follow-up.  If resolved, a resolution date should be documented on the eCRF.   
AEs ongoing at the final study visit (or upon early termination) will be followed for as long as 
necessary to adequately evaluate the subject’s safety or until the event stabilizes or resolves or 
until the subject is lost to follow up.  The investigator is responsible for ensuring that follow-up 
includes any supplemental investigations as may be indicated to elucidate the nature and/or causality of the AE.  This may include additional laboratory tests or investigations, 
histopathological examinations, or consultation with other health care professionals, as is 
practical.  
10.6. Serious Adverse Events  
All SAEs will be recorded from the time the subject has signed the ICF until the final study visit 
or 30 days after the last dose of study drug , whichever is longer in duration. 
10.6.1. Definition of a Serious Adverse Event  
An SAE is any AE that results in any of th e following outcomes: 
• Death.  
• A life -threatening AE.  Life threatening means that the subject was, in the view of the 
investigator or Sponsor, at immediate risk of death from the reaction as it occurred.  It does 
not mean that hypothetically the event might have caused death if it occurred in a more serious form.  
• Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization.  Hospitalization for 
elective treatment or a pre-existing condition that did not worsen during the clinical 
investigation is no t considered an AE.  Hospitalization or nursing home admission for the 
purpose of caregiver respite is not considered an AE.  Complications that occur during hospitalization are AEs, and if a complication prolongs hospitalization, the event is considered serious.  Treatment in a hospital emergency room is not a hospitalization. 
• A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions. 
• A congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
• Important medical events t hat may not result in death, be life threatening, or require 
hospitalization.  These events may be considered serious when, based on appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the health of the subject and may require medical or surgical interventio n to prevent one of the outcomes listed.  Any other event thought by the 
investigator to be serious should also be reported, following the reporting requirements

detailed in thi
s section.  Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm 
requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias, 
convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 
10.6.2. Managing Serious Adverse Events 
Subjects experiencing an SAE or an  emergency situation will be examined by a physician as 
soon as possible.  The physician in attendance will do whatever is medically needed for the 
safety and well -being of the subject.  The subject will remain under observation as long as 
medically indica ted.  Appropriate laboratory studies will be conducted until all parameters return 
to normal or are otherwise explained or stable.  The subject will be followed until the SAE resolves or until the subject is medically stabilized.  The investigator (or designee) will notify the NBI Medical Monitor (and the IRB, if necessary) immediately (within 24 hours) of the SAE and the outcome of the SAE. 
If an investigator becomes aware of an SAE within the time of informed consent until the final 
study visit or 30 days after the last dose of study drug (whichever is longer in duration), then the 
event must be documented and reported as described in Section  10.6.3. 
10.6.3. Reporting Serious Adverse Events and Other Immediately Reportable Events  
Serious AEs and other immediately reportable events (defined in Section  10.4)  must be reported 
within 24 hours of first knowledge of the event by study personnel to the NBI Medical Monitor 
or NBI Clinical Drug Safety (CDS) Department.  Reports of SAEs or pregnancies should be 
followed by a fax or email of the SAE or Pregnancy Form .  It is important that the investigator 
provide his or her assessment of relationship to study drug at the time of the initial SAE report.  
For SAEs or Other Immediately Reportable Events, contact CDS: 
 CDS telephone:   
 CDS  facsimile:   
 CDS e -mail:    
 NBI Medical Monitor:   Telephone:   
      Cell phone:   
10.6.4. Expedited Safety Reports  
NBI or its representatives will submit an Expedited Safety Report for any suspected adverse 
reaction (as defined in  Section  10.3)  that is considered both serious and unexpected within 
15 calendar days and for any unexpected fatal or life threatening experience within 7  calendar 
days via telephone or facsimile; or according to country specific regulations. 
NBI or its representatives will send copies of each safety report submitted to regulatory 
authorities to the investigators.  The safety report must be submitted to the appropriate IRB as 
soon as possible.  Documentation of the submission to the IRB and receipt by the IRB (if 
applicable) must be retained for each safety report.

10.7. Pregnancy  
Women of childbearing potential will be enrolled in this study.  In the event of a pregnancy, the 
following instructions should be followed. 
Pregnancy is neither an AE nor an SAE unless the criteria for an SAE are met.  However, all 
pregnancies in female subjects who received NBI -74788 will be followed to as sess for 
congenital anomaly.  If at any time between the time the subject signs the ICF and the last study visit a subject believes she is pregnant, the subject will be instructed to return to the study site within 24 hours and undergo a serum pregnancy test to confirm pregnancy. 
All confirmed pregnancies in subjects who received study drug must be immediately reported to 
NBI (refer to Section  10.6.3 for contact information), followed by fax or email of the pregnancy 
form to NBI  CDS.  A first trimester ultrasound will be required for all confirmed pregnancies.  
Pregnancies in subjects who received NBI -74788 will be followed until resolution (ie, 
termina tion [voluntary or spontaneous] or birth). 
11. DOCUMENTATION OF DATA  
11.1. Case Report Forms  
The case report form  data for this study are being collected with an electronic data capture 
(EDC) system .  The EDC 
system a
nd the study- specific eCRFs will comply with Title 21 CFR Part 11.  The documentation 
related to the validation of the EDC system is available through the vendor, , while the validation of the study specific eCRFs will be conducted by NBI and the required documentation will be maintained in the Trial Master File.  
The investigator will document subject data in his/her own subject files.  These subject files will serve as source data for the study.  All eCRF data required by this protocol will be recorded by 
authorized study personnel in the EDC system, with the exception of data captured in an 
electronic format, which will be loaded electronically into the appropriate eCRFs.  All data entered into the eCRF will be supported by source documentation.  The eCRF for each subject 
must be reviewed by the investigator and signed on the appropriate eCRF page(s).  This should 
be done as soon as possible after the subject completes the study.   
The investigator or an authorized member of the investig ator's staff will make any necessary 
additions/corrections to the eCRF.  All change information, including the date, person 
performing the corrections, and reason for the change will be available via the electronic audit trail, which is part of the EDC sys tem.  The eCRFs will be reviewed periodically for 
completeness, legibility, and acceptability by NBI (or designee).  NBI will also be allowed access to all source documents and medical records pertinent to the study in order to verify eCRF entries.  The Principal Investigator will review the eCRFs for completeness and accuracy and enter his or her electronic signature on the eCRFs as evidence thereof. 
 will provide access to the NBI portal of the EDC system for the duration of the study 
through a pa ssword -protected method of internet access.  Such access will be removed from 
investigator sites at the end of the site's participation in the study.  Data from the EDC system

12.7. Pharmacodynamic Data 
The primary PD assessments are:  morning 17- OHP (serum; ng/dL) from the 0600, 0800, and 
1000 hour samples (8-, 10-, and 12-hour postdose samples from Cohorts 1 and 2 and 11-, 13-, 
and 15-hour postdose samples from Cohorts 3 and 4) .  Secondary PD assessments are:  17 -OHP 
at all other times, androstenedione (serum; ng/dL), testosterone (serum; ng/dL), cortisol (serum; 
μg/dL), and ACTH (plasma; pg/mL).  
The PD assessments listed above will be summarized with descriptive statistics (including change from predose) and in graphical displays by dose cohort and timepoint. 
12.8. Safety Data  
TEAEs, categorized by system organ class (SOC) and /or preferred term as defined by MedDRA, 
will be summarized by dose cohort as well as overall.  A TEAE is defined as any AE that occurs after the first dose of study drug within a dose cohort .  Any AE that occurred before the first dose 
of study drug will be considered a pretreatment AE.  The TEAE tables will include the number 
and percentage of unique subjects experiencing each event.  The TEAEs will also be tabulated in 
terms of the number and percentage of subjects experiencing events by relationship to study drug if a sufficient  number of TEAEs is reported. 
Data listings will be presented for SAEs, deaths, and AEs leading to premature discontinuation from the study. 
Clinical laboratory  data, vital sign measurements, ECG data , and other safety data will be 
summarized by dose cohort and timepoint (as appropriate) with descriptive statistics.  Prior and 
concomitant medications and physical ex amination data will be presented in data listings.

Pharmacyclics LLC Proprietary and Confidential Page 3 STUDY SYNOPSIS 
Title: A Multicenter Phase 2 Study of the Bruton ’s Tyrosine Kinase (Btk) Inhibitor, 
PCI-32765, in Subjects with Relapsed or Relapsed and Refractory Multiple 
Myeloma 
Protocol Number: PCYC-1111-CA 
Phase: 2 
Duration of Study: Approximately Five Years  
Indication: Relapsed or relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma (MM) 
Study Drug and 
Comparator: PCI-32765 (ibrutinib) p.o. hard gelatin capsule and Dexamethasone p.o.  
No comparator is used in this study.  
Objectives: The primary objective of this study is to determine the efficacy of PCI-32765, 
both as a single agent and in combinati on with dexamethasone, in subjects with 
relapsed or relapsed and refractory MM as measured by the clinical benefit response rate (CBR), defined as the proportion of subjects who achieve stringent complete response (sCR), complete response (CR),very good partial response (VGPR), partial response (PR), or minimal response (MR) as 
assessed by the modified International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) 
response criteria.  
Secondary objectives are to evaluate the efficacy of PCI-32765 in this 
population as assessed by the duration of clinical benefit (DCB; ≥MR), 
objective response rate (ORR; ≥PR), duration of objective response (DOR), 
and the safety and drug pharmacokinetics (PK).  
Exploratory objectives are to evaluate progression-free survival (PFS), 
time to progression (TTP), overall survival (OS). 
Study Design: This is a Phase 2, open-label, nonrandomized, multi-cohort, multicenter Simon 2-stage study designed to assess the safety and efficacy of PCI-32765 in subjects with relapsed or relapsed and refractory MM.  
Treatment of PCI-32765 420 mg once daily in the original protocol 
(hereafter referred to as Cohort 1) was d esigned to detect a meaningful signal 
of activity while minimizing risk of continuing enrollment under null 
conditions.  Amendment 1 was designed to further explore the optimal regimen by increasing doses of PCI-32765 and/or by routine combination with low dose dexamethasone.   
Stage 1: 
• Up to eighteen (18) subjects will be enrolled to each Cohort 2, 3, 
and 4, for a maximum total of 54 subjects. 
• Stage 1 enrollment to Cohorts 3 and 4 may begin concurrently after Cohort 2 Stage 1 enrollment is complete.  If there is concurrent enrollment, Sponsor will implement centralized assignments into 
cohorts. 
 
 
  
PCI-32765 (Ibrutinib) PCYC-1111-CA, Amendment 6  18 April 2016 
Pharmacyclics LLC Proprietary and Confidential Page 4 Stage 2: 
• If ≥ 3 CBRs are observed within Cohorts 2, 3, or 4 in Stage 1, 
the Cohort(s) may be selected for expansion for up to a total of 
enrollment of 43 subjects or until observing ≥ 8 CBRs, whichever 
occurs earlier. 
• If there is concurrent Stage 2 enrollment to more than 1 Cohort at any given time, Sponsor will implement centralized assignments into cohorts. 
Sponsor maintains the prerogative to select regimen which gives optimal efficacy and safety results at interim analysis for further development while 
suspend other cohorts at any time. 
The expected total enrollment including Cohort 1 is between 67 (minimal) 
and 164 subjects. 
The dose cohorts are summarized in the table below.

†For Cohorts 1 and 3 subjects who have confirmed PD, and who are clinically stable, 
without significant worsening of symptoms or hematologic status (ie, meet all entry 
criteria for the study in regard to symptoms and hematology), will be eligible to receive dexamethasone 40 mg orally once per week in addition to continued 
treatment with PCI-32765, at the discretion of the investigator.  
Disease progression (PD) and response assessment will be performed by the 
investigators using the modified IMWG response criteria ( Appendix 5). 
Subjects will otherwise continue on st udy drug until PD
, withdrawal of 
consent, or until discontinuation of study drug due to an adverse event (AE).  Continued treatment with study drug will be allowed for as long as a subject 
receives benefit.

Pharmacyclics LLC Proprietary and Confidential Page 9 Concomitant Therapy 
and Clinical Practice: Permitted Concomitant Therapy  
Antiemetics or other standard supportive  agents are permitted as clinically 
indicated.  Hematopoietic growth fact ors are permitted per ASCO Guidelines55.  
Short courses (<14 days) of corticosteroids (at dosages equivalent to prednisone ≤ 20 mg per day) for treatment of non-cancer-related medical 
reasons are permitted. 
Prohibited Concomitant Therapy
 
Any chemotherapy, other myeloma-targeted therapy including “IMiDs” 
(eg, lenalidomide) and proteosome inhibitors (eg, bortezomib), anticancer immunotherapy and corticosteroids are prohibited.  Experimental therapy and 
radiotherapy to treat the underlying myeloma disease are also prohibited. 
Refer to 
1Appendix 2  for guidance on drugs that are CYP P450 inhibitors. 
Refer to Section 6.8.1.3 for guidance on concomitant use of anticoagulants. 
Statistical Methods: Subjects who meet the stated eligibilit y requirements will be enrolled in the 
study.   Full enrollment to Cohort 1 will be cont ingent upon Simon 2-stage design rules 
with a target sample size of 35 evaluable subjects based on meeting interim 
efficacy endpoints ie, if ≥ 2 CBRs are observed among the first 11 subjects 
within this cohort.  This cohort is designed to test the null hypothesis that the CBR of PCI-32765 monotherapy at a dose of 420 mg/day is ≤ 10% (not 
clinically compelling) versus the a lternative hypothesis that CBR will be 
≥ 30%, at a 1-sided significance level of 5%, with 85% power.  An interim 
analysis for futility will be performed wh en 11 subjects have been enrolled and 
have evaluable response data (ie, completed 6 treatment cycles and the Cycle 7 Day 1 assessments OR have discontinued treatment) or earlier if two or more 
subjects have documented CBR, defined as a MR or better.  Further enrollment to Cohort 1will be halted if there are fewer than 2 CBRs observed among these 11 subjects, or if deemed by sponsor.  Upon meeting the futility threshold, 
the second stage will enroll up to a total of 35 subjects.  
Up to 18 subjects will be enrolled to Cohorts 2, 3, and 4.  First stage 
enrollment will not be contingent u pon results in the other cohorts.  
Full enrollment to Cohorts 2, 3, and 4 will be contingent upon Simon 2-stage 
design rules with a sample size of up to 43 evaluable subjects based on meeting interim efficacy endpoints, ie, if ≥ 3 CBRs are observed among the first 
18 subjects within the subject cohort.  This design has 80% power to reject the null hypothesis of CBR ≤  10%, at a 1-sided significance level of 5%. 
Observation of ≥ 8 CBRs within an expanded cohort of up to 43 subjects will 
be considered consistent with th e alternative hypothesis of CBR rate ≥ 25%.  
The enrollment of that cohort may be  closed early for success once 8 CBRs 
observed. 
This study design is not powered or in tended to allow direct comparison of 
CBR among the cohorts.  Results of this study will inform alternative 
directions for future combination and single-agent development in alternative 
MM study populations.   
The final analyses will occur upon study completion.

2.0 INTRODUCTION 
2.1 Overview of the Disease 
Multiple myeloma (MM) is a di
sseminated malignant proliferation of plasma cells and 
plasmacytoid cells.1  Its yearly United States (US) age-adjusted incidence of 5.4/100,000 is 
comparable to that of chronic lymphocy tic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma 
(CLL/SLL; 5.7/100,000), which in turn is sec ond only to diffuse large B cell lymphoma 
(DLBCL; 6.9/100,000) among lymphoid malignancy subtypes.  Its most recently estimated 
(Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results [SEER ]) population based 5-year survival of 37.7% 
is inferior to those of CLL/SLL (77.1%) and DLBCL (59%).2  MM is thus one of the most 
significant areas of unmet medical need, in terms of survival and incidence, among lymphoid malignancies.  Myeloma cell growth occurs within bones and specifically involves the bone 
marrow.  Its clinical hallmarks include bone destruction, which may be manifested by lytic 
lesions, severe osteopenia, pa thologic fractures and hypercal cemia, and impaired bone marrow 
function, which may result in anemia, thrombocytope nia, and neutropenia.  Bone destruction in 
particular is a major cause of severe and disa bling morbidity in myeloma.  Bone lesions are 
present in the majority of patients at presentation  and nearly all patients by the time the disease 
runs its course.  Myeloma cells typically secr ete 1 (or rarely more) monoclonal paraprotein 
(M protein) molecule, which may be intact immu noglobulin (usually IgG or IgA; rarely IgD, E, 
or M) or free ( κ or λ) light chains.  Examples of comple tely nonsecretory myeloma are rare.  
Myeloma M proteins can cause numerous comp lications including renal insufficiency, 
amyloidosis, hyperviscosity, and neuropathy.  The va rious direct and indire ct destructive effects 
of myeloma cells render MM pa tients highly symptomatic and challenging to manage.  
In addition, these patients are su bject to greater morbidity and higher mortality compared to 
those with the more common subtypes of lymphoma.  
PCI-32765 (Ibrutinib) PCYC-1111-CA, Amendment 6  18 April 2016 
Pharmacyclics LLC Proprietary and Confidential Page 19 Myeloma cells are highly dependent upon the bo ne marrow microenvironment, including the 
presence of certain cytokines (eg, interleukin-6 [IL-6]), chem okines, macromolecules in the 
extracellular matrix, and supportiv e cells (stromal cells), for their growth and survival.  
Crucial cytokines and chemokines are secreted into the microenvironment by bone marrow (BM) 
stromal cells, and some by the MM cells themselv es.  Adhesion of MM cells to BM stromal cells 
triggers secretion of cytokines, which augmen t MM cell growth and survival and confers drug 
resistance.3  Vascular endotheli al growth factor, basic fibrob last growth factor–2, and other 
factors secreted by MM and/or BM stromal cells  promote angiogenesis, and thereby further 
support tumor cell growth and survival.  More recently, much progress has been made in 
elucidating the role of osteocla sts in the development of lytic  lesions and in reciprocally 
contributing to a microenvironment supportive of myeloma cell growth and progression.  
Multiple myeloma cells stimulate osteoclastogenesis by secretion of factors including receptor 
activator of nuclear factor κB ligand (RANKL), IL-6, and macr ophage inhibitory protein-1 α 
(MIP-1α), while osteoclasts themselves may produce IL-6, as well as interact with stromal cells.  
These interactions contribute to a favorable microenvironment for myeloma cell adhesion and 
proliferation.3-8 
Historically, the available treatments for MM were based upon alkylators (melphalan or 
cyclophosphamide), anthracyclines, dexamethasone, or vincristine in various combinations.  
Typically, 50% to 70% of subjects achieved an ob jective response to these regimens with little, 
if any, impact upon survival.  Current regimens include lenalidomide, thalidomide, bortezomib, 
and liposomal doxorubicin.  These regimens co mmonly also incorporat e high- or low-dose 
dexamethasone, and may also include melphalan fo r patients who are not tr ansplant candidates.  
Front-line therapy for most patients genera lly includes bortezomib and/or lenalidomide.1 
Survival following failure to th ese 2 agents is extremely poor.9 
High-dose alkylating agent chemotherapy, with or  without total body irradiation, followed by 
autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantat ion (ASCT) can achieve high (40%) complete 
response rates and a similar perc entage of partial responses.10  ASCT has become a widely 
accepted management option for many, if not most, patients.10-14  Syngeneic or allogeneic 
transplantation (allo-SCT or BMT) is perfor med less frequently, but patients can remain 
progression free at long in tervals post transplant.11,15-20  Once a patient relapses after single or 
tandem high-dose therapies and bone marrow transp lantations, there may not be an acceptable 
therapeutic option. 
2.2 PCI-32765 (Ibrutinib) Background 
PCI-32765 (ibrutinib; I MBRUVICA®) is a first-in-class, potent, or ally administered covalently-
binding inhibitor of Bruton’s tyrosi ne kinase (Btk) for the treatm ent of B-cell malignancies.   
Ibrutinib has been approved in many regions, including the US and EU, for indications covering 
the treatment of patients with mantle cell lym phoma (MCL) who have re ceived at least 1 prior 
therapy, patients with chronic lymphocytic leuke mia (CLL) including CLL with a deletion of the 
PCI-32765 (Ibrutinib) PCYC-1111-CA, Amendment 6  18 April 2016 
Pharmacyclics LLC Proprietary and Confidential Page 20 short arm of chromosome 17 (del17p) or a TP53 mutation, and patients with Waldenström’s 
Macroglobulinemia.  Ibrutinib is currently under investigation in other various indications as a 
single agent and in combinations.   
B cells are lymphocytes with multiple functions in the immune response, including antigen 
presentation, antibody production, and cytokine  release.  B cells express cell surface 
immunoglobulins comprising the B- cell receptor (BCR), which is  activated by binding to 
antigen.  Antigen binding induces receptor aggr egation and the clustering and activation of 
multiple tyrosine kinases, which in turn act ivate further downstream signaling pathways.53  
The process of B-cell matura tion, including immunoglobulin chai n rearrangement and somatic 
mutation, is tightly regulated.  It is thought that B-cell ly mphomas and CLL result from 
mutations and translocations acquire d during normal B-cell development.54  Several lines of 
evidence suggest that signaling th rough the BCR is necessary to sustain the viability of B-cell 
malignancies.   
The role of Btk in BCR signa l transduction is demonstrated by the human genetic 
immunodeficiency disease X-linked agammaglo bulinemia and the mouse genetic disease 
X-linked immunodeficiency, both caus ed by a mutation in the Btk gene.  These genetic diseases 
are characterized by reduced BCR si gnaling and a failure to genera te mature B-cells.  The Btk 
protein is expressed in most hematopoietic cells with the excepti on of T-cells and natural killer 
(NK) cells, but the selective effect  of Btk mutations suggests that it s primary functional role is in 
antigen receptor signaling in B-cells.21   
Data from Study PCYC-04753 demonstrate that although PCI-32765 is rapidly eliminated from 
the plasma after oral administration, once dail y dosing with PCI-32765 is adequate to sustain 
maximal pharmacodynamic activity fo r 24 hours postdose at dose levels ≥2.5 mg/kg.  In Study 
PCYC-04753, the Btk occupancies for the 2.5 mg/ kg/day to 12.5 mg/kg/day cohorts and for the 
560 mg continuous dosing cohort, were all above 90% at either 4 or 24 hours after drug 
administration.   
For the most comprehensive nonclinical a nd clinical informa tion regarding PCI-32765 
background, safety, efficacy, and in vitro and in  vivo preclinical activity and toxicology of 
PCI-32765, refer to the latest version of th e PCI-32765 Investigator's Brochure (IB).  
2.3 Btk and Multiple Myeloma 
Although Btk is markedly down-regu lated in normal plasma cells, it is highly expressed in the 
m
alignant cells from many myeloma patients and some cell lines.  Chauhan et al,22 showed that 
Btk mRNA expression was 2.3-fold increased in  6 MM patient specimens compared to normal 
human marrow precursors.  Kong et al,23 noted increased expression in 84% of primary myeloma 
samples and among some cell lines, especially ANBL-6 and INA-6, both of which are IL-6 
dependent.  Bam et al,24 reported expression particularly among cases within the MF gene 
PCI-32765 (Ibrutinib) PCYC-1111-CA, Amendment 6  18 April 2016 
Pharmacyclics LLC Proprietary and Confidential Page 21 expression profile (GEP) grouping, and also comm only in cases within the DC-1, DC-2, HY, 
and LB subgroups.25,26  Multiple myeloma cells with the MF  GEP are known to be particularly 
dependent upon micro-environmenta l interactions and integrin β7-based adherence to the bone 
marrow stroma.27  These cases tend to be clinically aggressive.  The DC-2 GEP subtype often 
carries t(11;14) (q13, q32), wh ich involves the same chromosomes and bands as the 
characteristic translocation of mantle cell lym phoma (MCL), albeit with  differing breakpoints.  
This subtype tends to have a lymphoplasmacytic cytology, rather than purely plasmacytic 
cytology, and to express multiple markers associ ated with BCR or its function, including CD20, 
CD79a, VPREB, and PAX5.28  Since inhibition of stromal adhe rence is an important mechanistic 
feature of PCI-32765 activity and since PCI-32765 has significant clinical activity in MCL and 
lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma (LPL), it is reasonab le to anticipate clin ical activity in MM, 
especially in subtypes with such features.  
The ability of PCI-32765 to inhib it osteoclast (OC) development and function, as well as micro-
environmental interactions, is a further basis to test this drug in MM patients.  As specialized 
mature cells of the myelomonocytic lineage, OCs are known to express Btk.  Although neither 
Xid mice nor XLA patients have a clear clinical defect  related to loss of Btk function, recent 
observations have shown that Btk is nonethele ss important in OC function and development.  
Monocytic OC precursor cells from Xid mice are defective in multinucleate osteoclast formation 
in response to RANKL.29  Btk/TEC knockout (KO) mice (but not Btk KO mice) have 
osteopetrotic bones associated with  defective osteoclast formation.30  XLA patients have a 
similar defect in OC formation in vitro, which ha s been suggested to be masked in vivo by higher 
than normal levels of regulatory cytokines.31  PCI-32765 has been found to  inhibit production of 
human OC from progenitors in vitro as well as cytokine and chemokine secretion.  Erosion of 
human bone chips by myeloma xenografts in SCID mice was furthermore inhibited by 
PCI-32765 treatment, as was progr ession of the tumor itself.23 
In contrast to its activity in vivo systems, PC I-32765 was found to exert only limited apoptotic or 
growth inhibitory effects in suspension in vitro cultures of MM patient samples or cell lines that 
have been tested at clinically re levant (ie, submicromolar) levels.23  This has often been similarly 
noted when in vitro cell lines corresponding to other lymphopro liferative diseases with known 
clinical sensitivity to PCI-32765 have been teste d.  PCI-32765 mechanism of action is apparently 
related to cells micro-environm ental interactions, which may include engagement of the BCR or 
other receptors.  Adaptation to in vitro suspensi on growth by definition selects for independence 
of specific micro-environmental interactions. 
The putative myeloma stem cell or cancer regenerating cell as identified by Matsui32 was found 
to be enriched in the CD138neg subfraction of both MM patient samples and cell lines.  This 
functionally defined cell was furt her found to have phenotypic featur es generally consistent with 
a memory B cell phenotype, including BCR com ponent and associated marker proteins, 
and small cell lymphoid morphology.  Two groups have independently reported increased Btk 
expression in cell subfractions (CD138neg or CXCR4+) and expect them to be enriched for this 
PCI-32765 (Ibrutinib) PCYC-1111-CA, Amendment 6  18 April 2016 
Pharmacyclics LLC Proprietary and Confidential Page 22 colony forming population,23,24 compared to the bulk population of MM cells.  Consistent with 
this observation, Matsui found PCI-32765 to be i nhibitory to in vitro colony formation by 
CD138neg cells (but not growth of CD138+ cells in bulk culture) from  5/5 patient samples tested 
at concentrations as low as 10 nM.33  A selective effect of PCI-32765 on the self-renewing 
subpopulation would further explai n the difficulty of documenting inhibition of short-term 
cultures of predominantly CD138+ non-fractionated cells.  Such a selective effect could be 
advantageous for clinical use, as putative st em cells tend to be re sistant to conventional 
antineoplastic agents. 
In summary, PCI-32765 is hypothesized to have pot entially important clinical activity in MM by 
virtue of inhibitory demonstrated effects upon (1) OC function and development resulting in 
bone destruction, (2) micro-envi ronmental interactions importa nt for MM cell adherence and 
growth, and (3) MM repopulating cell growth.   
2.4 Summary of Relevant Nonclinical and Clinical Data 
For the most comprehensive nonclinical a nd clinical information regarding PCI-32765, 
please refer to the current  version of the IB.  
2.4.1 Nonclinical Studies with PCI-32765 
2.4.1.1 Pharmacology 
PCI-32765 was designed as a selective and irreversible inhibitor of the Btk protein,34 in vitro, 
PCI-32765 is a potent inhib itor of Btk activity (IC 50 = 0.39 nM).  The irreversible binding of 
PCI-32765 to cysteine-481 in the active site of Btk results in sustaine d inhibition of Btk and 
enhanced selectivity over other kinases that do no t contain a cysteine at  this position.  When 
added directly to human whole blood, PCI- 32765 inhibited signal transduction from the BCR 
and blocked activation of B cells (IC 50 = 80 nM).  Inhibition of B cell activation by PCI-32765 in 
peripheral blood mononuclear cells was measured by quantifying the level of the cell surface 
marker CD69 following stimulation of th e BCR with anti-immunoglobulin antibodies.  
Continuous exposure to 10 nM PCI-32765 for 18 hour s resulted in the complete prevention of 
up-regulation of CD69, whereas up- regulation of CD69 induced by T cell receptor stimulus was 
blocked only by continuous exposure to 10 µM PCI-32765, indicating that  PCI-32765 is more 
than 1000-fold selective for inhibition of antig en receptor signaling in B cells over T cells.35  
PCI-32765 arrested cell growth a nd induced apoptosis in human B cell lymphoma cell lines in 
vitro and inhibited tumor growth in vivo in xenograft models.35  In mice, tumor growth inhibition 
was demonstrated at dose levels where no ove rt toxicity was observed, as measured by body 
weights.  In addition, PCI-32765 was efficacious in a mouse model of collagen-induced arthritis, 
a disease whose pathogenesis involves B cell activation. 
PCI-32765 (Ibrutinib) PCYC-1111-CA, Amendment 6  18 April 2016 
Pharmacyclics LLC Proprietary and Confidential Page 23 Binding of PCI-32765 to the active site of Btk (Btk  occupancy) was demonstrated in vivo in rat 
and dog blood mononuclear cells, mouse splenocytes, and xenograft tumor cells using a 
pharmacodynamic assay, which uses a specially designed Btk-binding fluorescent probe.  
The probe binds irreversibly to the active site of Btk, enabling fluorescent detection of labeled 
Btk protein.  The presence of PCI-32765 bound to the Btk active site precludes probe binding, 
thus reducing the fluorescence probe signal.  In mice, 50% of the Btk active sites in splenocytes 
were occupied 3 hours following a single oral dose of PCI-32765 at 5 mg/kg.  Mice orally 
administered PCI-32765 30 mg/kg had complete Bt k active-site occupancy in splenocytes, 
which persisted for approximately 12 hours postdose.  In dogs, a single oral dose of 10 mg/kg 
resulted in complete occupancy of Btk m easured in peripheral blood mononuclear cells 
(PBMCs).  The complete occupancy persisted for ≥ 24 hours with partia l recovery by 48 hours 
postdose.  PCI-32765 added to human blood (ex vivo) led to complete Btk occupancy 
(IC 50= 100 nM) and inhibition of B cell activation measured by CD69 expression.

les and 2.5, 40, and 
150 mg/kg/day for females) and dogs (1.5, 24, and 150 mg/kg/day) have been performed.  At the 
respective highest dosage, minor to mild clinical  signs and histopathologic findings were noted.   
A cardiac study in radiotelemetry-monitored dogs (single doses of 24 and 150 mg/kg) also has 
been performed.  Lower heart ra tes were observed from 1 to 6 hours postdose, consistent with 
prolongation of the RR interval.  No treatment-related prolongation of the corrected QT interval 
(QTc) was observed. 
2.4.1.3 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis,  Im pairment of Fertility 
Carcinogenicity studies have not  been conducted with PCI-32765. 
PCI-32765 was not mutagenic in a bacterial mutageni city (Ames) assay, was not clastogenic in a 
chromosome aberration assay in mammalian (CHO) cells, nor was it clastogenic in an in vivo 
bone marrow micronucleus assay in mice at doses up to 2000 mg/kg. 
Fertility studies with PCI-32765 have not been c onducted in animals.  In the general toxicology 
studies conducted in rats and dogs , orally administered ibrutinib did not result in adverse effects 
on reproductive organs.

Pharmacyclics LLC Proprietary and Confidential Page 25 2.4.3 Risks 
2.4.3.1 Atrial Fibrillation 
Atrial fibrillation and at rial flutter have been reported in  subjects treated with ibrutinib, 
particularly in subjects with car diac risk factors, hypertension, acute infections, and a previous 
history of atrial fibrillation.  Fo r atrial fibrillation wh ich persists, consider the risks and benefits 
of ibrutinib treatment and follow the pr otocol dose m
odification guidelines (see Section 6.5.1). 
2.4.3.2 Bleeding-related Events 
There are reports of hemorrhagic events in subjec ts treated with ibrutini b, both with and without 
thrombocytopenia.  These include minor hemorrhag ic events such as contusion, epistaxis, and 
petechiae; and ma
jor hemorrhagic events, some fatal, including gastrointestinal bleeding, 
intracranial hemorrhage, and hematuria.  Us e of ibrutinib in s ubjects requiring other 
anticoagulants or medications that  inhibit platelet function may in crease the risk of bleeding.  
Subjects with congenital bleeding diat hesis have not been studied.  See Section 6.8.1.3 for 
guidance on concomitant use of anticoagulants, an tiplatelet therapy and/or supplements.  See 
Section 6.7.3 for guidance on ibrutinib management with surgeries or procedures.   
2.4.3.3
 Cytopenias  
Treatment-em
ergent Grade 3 or 4 cytopenias (neu tropenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia) were 
reported in subjects treat ed with ibrutinib.  
2.4.3.4
 Diarrhea  
Diarrhea is the most frequen tly reported non-hematologic AE with ibrutinib monotherapy and 
combination therapy.  Other frequently reported g
astrointestinal events include nausea, vomiting, 
and constipation.  These events are rarely severe .  These events are rarely severe.  Should 
symptoms be severe or prolonged follow the protocol dose modification guidelines 
(see Section 6.5.1).  
2.4.3.5 Infections  
Fatal and non-fatal infections have  occurred with ibruti nib therapy.  At least 25% of subjects with 
MCL and 35% of subjects with CLL had Grad e 3 or greater infections per NCI Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE).  The most commonly reported infections 
include pneumonia, cellulitis, urin ary tract infection and sepsis.  Although causality has not been 
estab
lished, cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) have occurred in patients 
treated with ibrutinib.  
2.4.3.6 Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD) 
Cases of interstitial lung dis ease (ILD) have been reported in patients treated with ibrutinib. 
Monitor patients for pulmonary symptom
s indica tive of ILD.  Should symptoms develop follow 
the protocol dose modification guidelines (see Section 6.5.1). 
PCI-32765 (Ibrutinib) PCYC-1111-CA, Amendment 6  18 April 2016 
Pharmacyclics LLC Proprietary and Confidential Page 26 2.4.3.7 Non-melanoma Skin Cancer 
Non-melanoma skin cancers have o
ccurred in patients treated with ibrutinib.  Monitor patients 
for the appearance of non-melanoma skin cancer. 
2.4.3.8 Rash 
Rash has been commonly reported in subjects trea ted with either single agent ib
rutinib or in 
combination with chemotherapy.  In a ra ndomized Phase 3 study (PCYC-1112-CA), rash 
occurred at a higher rate in the ibrutinib arm than in the control arm.  Most rashes were mild to 
moderate in severity.   
2.4.3.9 Tumor Lysis Syndrome 
There have been reports of tumor lysis syndr ome (TLS) events in subjects treated with 
single-agent ibrutinib or in com
bination with ch emotherapy.  Subjects at risk of TLS are those 
with comorbidities and/or risk factors such as high tumor burden prior to treatment, increased 
uric acid (hyperuricemia), elevated LDH, bulky disease at baseline, and pre ‐existing kidney 
abnormalities. 
2.4.4 Clinical Pharmacokinetics 
Following oral administration of ibrutinib at doses ranging from 420 to 840 m
g/day, exposure to 
ibrutinib increased proportionally to doses increased with substantial intersubject variability. The 
mean half life (t1/2) of ibrutin ib  ranged from 4 to 13 hours, with a median time to maximum 
plasma concentration (Tmax) of 2 hours. Taking into account the approximate doubling in mean systemic exposure when dosed with food and the fa vorable safety profile, ibrutinib can be dosed 
with or without food. Ibrutin ib is extensively metabolized primarily by cytochrome 
P450 (CYP) 3A4. The on-target effects of metabo lite PCI-45227 are not c onsidered clinically 
relevant. Steady-state exposure of ibrutinib and PCI-45227 was le ss than 2-fold of first dose 
exposure. Less than 1% of ibrutinib is excreted  renally. Ibrutinib exposure is not altered in 
patients with creatinine clearance (CrCl) >30 mL/min. Patients with severe renal impairment or 
patients on dialysis have not been studied. Following single dose administration, the AUC of 
ibrutinib increased 2.7-, 8.2- and 9.8-fold in subj ects with mild (Child-P ugh class A), moderate 
(Child-Pugh class B), and severe (Child-Pugh class C) hepatic impairment compared to subjects with normal liver function. A higher proportion of  Grade 3 or higher adverse reactions were 
reported in patients with B-cell malignancie s (CLL, MCL and WM) with mild hepatic 
impairment based on NCI organ dysfunction work ing group (NCI-ODWG) criteria for hepatic 
dysfunction compared to patients with normal hepatic function. 
2.4.5 PCYC-1111-CA Stage 1 Summary 
As of 31 December 2013, a total of 69 subjects were
 enrolled in Stage 1: 13 subjects in Cohort 1, 
18 subjects in Cohort 2, 18 subjects in Cohort 3 and 20 subjects in Cohort 4.   
PCI-32765 (Ibrutinib) PCYC-1111-CA, Amendment 6  18 April 2016 
Pharmacyclics LLC Proprietary and Confidential Page 27 The observed safety profile acro ss the four tested c ohorts in this ongoing study did not indicate 
clinically meaningful differences and the overall obtained safety prof ile with ibrutinib alone or in 
combination is consistent with the reported treatment-emergent AEs detailed in the current 
version of the IB for PCI-32765.   
Efficacy data collection is ongoing with 19 subjects still on treatment and 4 subjects treated for 
more than 6 cycles.  The Simon 2-stage enrollment expansion criteria were met for Cohort 4 with 
4 confirmed minimal responses (MR) a nd 9 subjects remaining on treatment. 
2.5 Rationale for Study Design and Dose 
This study is based upon the biology of Btk and its inhibition in MM from preclinical laboratory 
studies conducted ( Section 2.4.1
).  PCI-32765 is hypothesized to have potentially important 
clinical activity in MM by virt ue of demonstrated inhibitory  effects upon (1) OC function and 
developm
ent resulting in bone de struction, (2) micro-environmenta l interactions important for 
MM cell adherence and growth, and (3) MM repopulating cell gr owth.  The extremely broad 
activity noted in early  phase clinical studies of PC I-32765 in a wide range of B cell 
malignancies, including LPL/WM a nd MCL, is also supportive of exploring clinical effects in 
MM subjects.   
This multi-cohort study follows a 2-stage design among previously treated subjects, with dosing 
in the first cohort consisting of 420 mg per da y PCI-32765 (3 x 140-mg capsules) administered 
once daily without interruption.  Pharmacodynami c analysis in a Phase 1 study PCYC-04753 and 
Phase 2 study PCYC-1102-CA revealed comple te Btk active-site occupancy at doses of 
2.5 mg/kg and above, including the 420 mg continuous dosing cohort.  The highest dose safely 
explored in the Phase 1 study was 12.5 mg/kg, and ex tensive experience has b een gained at doses 
of 8.3 mg/kg as well as at fixed doses of 560 and 840 mg/day in a number of studies.  
No maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was establishe d in studies conducted at these doses.  In a 
subsequent Phase 1b/2 study of CLL/SLL dosed  with 420 vs 840 mg/day (PCYC-1102-CA), 
neither responses nor toxicity was significantly different between the two arms.  Therefore, 
a substantial margin of safety  has been established for dosing at 420 (up to 840) mg/day.  
The safety profile of PCI-32765 observed to date  does not suggest the likelihood of exacerbation 
of pre-existing cumulative toxicities typica l in this previously treated population.  
Thirteen subjects with MM were  enrolled to Cohort 1 of this study from March to June 2012 and 
further accrual was on hold as per the protocol stipulated interim analysis, until responses among 
these subjects can be fully evaluated.  Eviden ce of anti-tumor activity in  this population, as well 
as effects upon bone turnover and cytokine levels in some subj ects supports that further dose 
ranging is indicated.  In Amendment 1, additiona l cohorts have been added to explore both 
higher doses and the routine addition of dexame thasone; the rationales for these changes are 
summarized as follows: 
PCI-32765 (Ibrutinib) PCYC-1111-CA, Amendment 6  18 April 2016 
Pharmacyclics LLC Proprietary and Confidential Page 28 While 420 mg/day is the dose that has been applie d in Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies of CLL/SLL, 
a higher dose of 560 mg/day is used in Phase 2 studies of the more aggressive NHL subtypes 
DLBCL and MCL.  There are several rationales fo r considering higher doses in some settings 
including:  1) expectation of higher rates of mutations of Btk and related signaling molecule 
genes in more aggressive diseases with greater chromosomal instability;  2) differing levels of 
tissue exposure or cellular penetra tion;  3) possible PK differences among individuals in different 
disease populations;  and 4) possible further acti vity benefit from inhibition of other kinase 
targets (e.g. BLK, BMX, ITK) at higher drug exposure levels.   
Dexamethasone 40 mg p.o. weekly (termed “low dose or LD dexamethasone”) is added to the 
treatment of subjects in  Cohorts 1 and 3 with evidence of ear ly disease progression (PD) with the 
goal of short-term stabilization to potentially a llow more gradually deve loping responsiveness to 
PCI-32765 to emerge, while all subjects in Cohorts 2 and 4 will have dexamethasone added 
during the first cycle.  Myeloma regimens ar e commonly augmented with dexamethasone, which 
often appears to improve respons e to other agents.  More specifically, Btk expression was found 
to be up-regulated at both the protein and mRNA  levels in MM1R dexa methasone-resistant cells 
compared to the sensitive parent line MM1S, sugge sting a possible role of  Btk in the mechanism 
of dexamethasone resistance.22  Dexamethasone has been noted to be markedly synergistic with 
PCI-32765 in vitro growth inhibiti on of lymphoma cell lines (Pha rmacyclics, unpublished data).  
PCI-32765 exhibited protection against in vitro dentine pit formation, a commonly used model of 
osteoporosis, stimulated by dexamethasone.23  The dose of dexamethasone selected for this part 
of the study corresponds to that us ed in the LD combination with lenalidomide.  This dose was 
found to have superior safety and comparab le activity to high-dose dexamethasone in 
combination with lenalidomide.39  High-dose dexamethasone al one in relapsed populations 
studied as controls for bortezomib and lenalidomi de pivotal studies have had consistently limited 
activity:  ORR = 19% to 23%, CR = < 1% to  4%, and TTP = 3.5 to 4.7 months [Revlimid® and 
Velcade® package inserts].  The PCYC-1111-CA st udy eligibility selects a more heavily 
pretreated population co mpared to the Revlimid® and Velcade® pivotal studies.  Thus, in an 
analysis of the APEX trial data, ORR and median TTP to high dose  dexamethasone among 
bortezomib-naïve patients previously treated wi th thalidomide was significantly decreased to 
10% and 2.8 months, respectively.50  These numbers are likely to more accurately reflect an 
upper limit to the expected  single agent activity of low-dose  dexamethasone in the more heavily 
pre-treated population en tering the current study. 
PCI-32765 inhibited cytokine production and osteoc last development and function in vitro as 
well as bone destruction in vivo ( Section 2.4.1).  Biomarkers of bone turnover40 and cytokine and 
chemokine levels4,6-8,41 will be obtained during the study.  Increased peripheral blood tumor cell 
mobilization or trafficking has been fre quently observed both in CLL and non-CLL 
non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma subjects treated with PCI-32765.42  Peripheral blood levels of CD138+ 
cells, and their pattern of CD45 and CD38 expression, will therefore be measured among 
subjects treated in this study.

subjects in Cohort 4 expansion to investigate possible mechanisms of treatment sensitivity and 
resistance.   
Bone marrow aspirate specimens will be collected prior to start of dosing, if CR is suspected and 
at progression.  The sample obtained at progressi on may be at any time from when progression 
occurs, and the patient is taken off treatment,  up to the start of a different treatment.   
The bone marrow aspirate will be analyzed ce ntrally using fluorescence in-situ hybridization 
(FISH) and the analysis may include, but is not limited to the following probes: t(11;14), t(4;14), 
t(14;16), del 13q and del 17p.  The remaining bone marrow aspirate specimen will undergo flow 
cytometry analysis and may be processed by CD138+ enrichment.  If sufficient sample is 
available it will be used for the following a ssessments:  Whole Exome Sequencing (WES), 
RNA sequencing (RNASeq), and gene alteration analysis. 
Instructions for collection, processing, and shipping will be in the Laboratory Manual 
accompanying this protocol.

6.0 TREATMENT OF SUBJECTS 
6.1 Randomization and Blinding 
This is an op
en-label study.  Subjects will not be blinded to study drug nor will they be randomly 
assigned to a treatment group.  Enrolled subjec ts will receive open-label PCI-32765 capsules. 
6.2 Formulation, Packaging, and Storage 
PCI-32765 is provided in hard gelatin capsules containing 140 mg of PCI-32765.  The capsules 
are packaged in opaque high-density polyethylen e plas
tic bottles with labels bearing the 
appropriate label text as required by governing regulatory agencies.  The drug product is 
manufactured for Pharmacyclics LLC, by a contr act manufacturer.  All formulation excipients 
are compendial and are commonly used in oral formulations.  
The recommended storage condition for PCI-32765 cap sules is 15 to 25°C; excursions permitted 
to 30°C.  Refer to the IB for additional informa tion regarding the drug product to be used in this 
study. If a drug shipment arrives damaged, or if there are any other drug complain ts, please refer to the 
pharmacy study binder for further instructions.  
6.3 Dosage and Administration  
6.3.1 PCI-32765 
PCI-32765 140-mg capsules are intended to be adm
inistered orally once daily with 8 ounces 
(approximately 240 mL) of water (avoid grapefruit or Seville orange juic e due to CYP450 3A4/5 
inhibition).  The capsules should be swallowed intact and subjects should not attempt to open 
PCI-32765 (Ibrutinib) PCYC-1111-CA, Amendment 6  18 April 2016 
Pharmacyclics LLC Proprietary and Confidential Page 37 capsules or dissolve them in water.  Subjects should refrain from taking the study drug on the 
morning of study visits designated for PK  sampling until seen at the site (see Section 7.1.2).  
One cycle of treatment is once-daily administration of PCI-32765 for 28 days.  
Dosages are as follows: 
Cohort PCI-32765 (mg/day) Dexamethasone 
1 420 (3 capsules) Upon PD, 40 mg once weekly is allowed 
2 560 (4 capsules) 40 mg once weekly 
3 840 (6 capsules) Upon PD, 40 mg once weekly is allowed 
4 840 (6 capsules) 40 mg once weekly 
Subjects will continue on study drug until PD, wit hdrawal of consent, or until discontinuation of 
study drug due to an AE.  Subjects may continue  study drug as long as th e subject is deriving 
clinical benefit (SD or better) and the subject is not experien cing any unacceptable toxicity. 
PCI-32765 capsules should be taken at approximately the same time each day.  If a dose is 
missed, it can be taken as soon as possible on the same day with a return to the normal schedule 
the following day.  The missed dose will not be made  up and must be returned to the site at the 
next scheduled visit.   
A subject diary will be used to aid wi th study drug administration compliance. 
Only enough PCI-32765 capsules to supply subject un til the next study visit should be dispensed 
with the exception of Cycle 1 where enough PCI-32765 capsules for the entire cycle can be 
dispensed.  Unused PCI-32765 capsules dispensed dur ing previous visits must be returned and 
drug accountability records ( Section 10.8) updated according to the schedule in Appendix 4. 
Returned capsules must not be re-dispensed to the same subject or  to another subject. 
Investigators are prohibited from supplying PCI-32765 capsules to any subject not properly 
enrolled in this study or to a ny physician or scientis t except those designate d as subinvestigators 
on Form FDA 1572.  The investigator must ensure  that subjects receive P
CI-32765 capsules only 
from personnel who fully understand the proc edures for administ ering the study drug. 
6.3.2 Dexamethasone 
Subjects rec
eiving dexamethasone will receive 40 mg orally once per week.  Dexame
thasone 
may be taken as either a single dose in the morn ing or as divided doses over the course of the 
day. 
PCI-32765 (Ibrutinib) PCYC-1111-CA, Amendment 6  18 April 2016 
Pharmacyclics LLC Proprietary and Confidential Page 38 6.3.3 Combination of PCI-32765 and Dexamethasone Dosing  
6.3.3.1 For Subjects with PD (Cohorts 1 and 3) 
At the discretion of the investig ator and after Cycle 1, subjects in Cohorts 1 and 3 who have PD 
and who are clinically stable, w ithout significant worsening of symptoms or hematologic status 
(ie, meet all entry criteria for the study in rega rd to symptoms and hemato logy), will be eligible 
to receive dexamethasone 40 mg
 orally once per week in addition to continued treatment with 
PCI-32765.  PD should be confirmed or have re peat laboratory samples collected prior to 
addition of dexamethasone.  Dexamethasone admi nistration may commence at any time during a 
PCI-32765 cycle.  Blood samples for PK should be obtained during the initial cycle with added 
dexamethasone (Cohort 1 and 3 only), according to Section 7.1.2.  
6.3.3.2 Concurrent Dosing of PCI-32765/Dexamethasone Combination 
(Cohorts 2 and 4) 
PCI-32765 will be administered orally once dail y at dosages of 560 mg (Cohort 2) and 840 mg 
(Cohort 4).  Dexamethasone 40 mg will be admi
nistered orally once weekly, starting Day 4 of 
Cycle 1.  The rationale for this timing is to 1)  prevent toxicity from dexamethasone confounding 
safety and tolerability as might occur if admi nistered concurrently on Day 1, and 2) to allow 
intra-subject assessment of impact  of dexamethasone on PCI-32765 PK. 
6.3.3.3 Concurrent Dosing of PCI-32765/Dexamethasone Combination (Cohort 4 expansion) 
PCI-32765 will be administered orally once daily at a dose of 840 mg (6 x 140 mg capsules).  
Dexamethasone 40 mg will be administe
red or ally once weekly, starting Day 8 of Cycle 1, 
following completion of the 7 hour postdose PK sample collection. 
6.4 Early Cellular Mobilization 
Administration of PCI-32765 to subjects with ot her lymphoproliferative diseases has been 
associated with mobilization of tumor cells from tissue to peripheral blood.42,45,46  This effect 
begins in some cases within hours of the firs t administration and has been maximal within 
weeks.  It has been often accompanied by rapi d symptomatic improvement.  It is therefore 
possible that increased MM cells  will appear in the blood samp les collected early on in the 
treatment of subjects during this study.  If such a phenom enon occurs, continued observation or 
treatment should be discussed with the medical mon itor.  Note:  an increase in the presence of 
circulating plasma cells in peripheral blood in the absence of other indicato rs of active disease is 
not an indicator of PD. 
6.5 Criteria for Holding or Adjusting Study Drug Dose 
6.5.1 Criteria for Holding PCI-32765 
Dosing will be held for any of the following conditions: 
PCI-32765 (Ibrutinib) PCYC-1111-CA, Amendment 6  18 April 2016 
Pharmacyclics LLC Proprietary and Confidential Page 39 • Grade 4 ANC (< 500/µL) for > 7 days (neutrophil growth factors are permitted). 
• Grade 3 Platelets (< 50,000/µL)in the presen ce of clinically significant bleeding 
• Grade 4 Platelets (< 25,000/µL) 
• Grade 3 or 4 nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea (if persistent despite optimal anti-emetic 
and/or antidiarrheal therapy). 
Any other related grade 4 toxic ities and any unmanageable nonhe matologic Grade 3 toxicities.   
Table 2: Drug Discontinuation  Actions for Subjects on PCI-32765 
 Action to be taken - Hematologic Adverse Events 
• May resume therapy once ANC ≥750, follow dose modification guidelines below after first occurrence 
• May resume therapy once platelets >25,000 and no evid ence of clinically significant bleeding, follow dose 
modification guidelines below after first occurrence 
Occurrence Action to be Taken - Non-hematologic Adverse Events 
First Withhold study drug until recovery to Grade ≤ 1 or baseline; may restart at original dose level 
Second Withhold study drug until recovery to Grade ≤1 or baseline; may restart at 1 dose level lower (ie, 
Phase 1: 420 mg/day for 560 mg /day cohort; or 700 mg/day for 840 mg/day cohort or Phase 2b: 
reduce daily dose by 1 capsule/day) 
Third Withhold study drug until recovery to Grade ≤1 or baseline; may restart at 1 dose level lower (ie, 
Phase 1: 280 mg/day for 560 mg/day cohort; or 560 mg/day for 840 mg/day cohort or Phase 2b: 
reduce daily dose by 2 capsules/day) 
Fourth Discontinue study drug* 
*If study drug is discontinued for toxicity, subject will end the Treatment Phase of the study. 
Changes must be recorded in the Dosage Administration section of the case report form (CRF).

If complete resolution or improveme nt of the toxicity to Grade 1 or to baseline values is achieved 
within 28 days, the investigator may elect to ha ve the subject restart treatment with study drug.   
If the toxicity takes more than 28 days to reso lve, then discussion with  the medical monitor is 
required prior to the subject re starting treatment with study drug.  Upon restarting treatment with 
study drug, the investigator may elect to reduce the subject’s dose of study drug by 1 dose level, 
or by 2 dose levels if previously dose reduced, if the toxicity is consider ed likely related to study 
drug and likely to recur at the subject’s current daily dose.  Ot herwise, study drug should be 
restarted at their cu rrent daily dose.  
PCI-32765 (Ibrutinib) PCYC-1111-CA, Amendment 6  18 April 2016 
Pharmacyclics LLC Proprietary and Confidential Page 40 6.5.2 Dose Modification for Hepatic Impaired Subjects 
Ibrutinib is metabolized in the liver.  For subj ects who develop mild liver im
pairment while on 
study (Child-Pugh class A), the recommended dose reduction for ibrutinib is to a level of 280 mg 
daily (two capsules).  For subjects who de velop moderate liver impairment while on study 
(Child-Pugh class B), the recommended dose redu ction is to a level of 140 mg daily (one 
capsule).  Subjects who develop severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C) must hold study 
drug until resolved to moderate impairment (Chi ld-Pugh class B) or better .  Monitor subjects for 
signs of toxicity and follow dose modifi cation guidance as needed (Refer to Appendix 6 ). 
6.5.3 Criteria for Holding or Adjusting Dexamethasone 
Up to three successive dose reductions of dexa
methasone, from 40 mg to 20, 8, and 4 mg per 
week per investigator discretion, may be instituted for related t oxicity which is unmanageable by 
supportive measures.  Failure to to lerate 4 mg per week should lead to discontinuation of drug.  
Specific acute toxicities commonly noted with de xamethasone and other corticosteroids include 
upper gastrointestinal (dyspepsia, ulcer, gastritis), neurologic (c onfusion, mood alteration, 
insomnia), edema, hyperglycemia, and muscular weakness.   
6.6 Criteria for Permanent Disc ontinuation of Study Drug 
Investigato
rs are encouraged to keep a subject who is experiencing clin ical benefit (refer to 
Section 4.1) in the study unless signifi cant toxicity puts the subject at risk or routine 
noncompliance puts the study outcomes 
at risk.  If the subject meet s any of the following criteria, 
then withdrawal from the st udy treatment is mandatory: 
• Subject has confirmed PD. 
• Subject has an intercurrent illness or AE that prev ents further PCI-32765 capsule 
administration. 
• Subject decides to withdraw from study or becomes pregnant. 
• Subject is noncompliant with study pro cedures and/or scheduled evaluations. 
• Subject requires a prohib ited concomitant medication or bone marrow transplant. 
• Investigator considers withdr awal to be in the best interest of the subject. 
• Pharmacyclics requires that the subject with draw or Pharmacyclic s and/or regulatory 
authorities terminate the study. 
• Subject completes the study. 
• Subjects who withdraw for any reason afte r receiving the first dose of PCI-32765 will not 
be replaced.  Subjects who w ithdraw prior to the firs t dose of PCI-32765 may be 
replaced. 
6.6.1 Withdrawal of Consent 
If a subject withdraws consent, it should be defined in the medical record if the subject 
withdraws c
onsent to treatment and all further cont act or if the subject withdraws partial consent, 
PCI-32765 (Ibrutinib) PCYC-1111-CA, Amendment 6  18 April 2016 
Pharmacyclics LLC Proprietary and Confidential Page 41 ie, they no longer wish to receive treatment, but  will participate in the Safety Follow Up Visit 
and/or Long term Follow up. 
6.7 Concomitant Therapy 
6.7.1 Permitted Concomitant Therapy 
Antiemetics are permitted if clinically indica ted.  Standard supportive care m
edications are 
permitted.  Use of hematopoietic growth factors is permitted in accordance with ASCO 
guidelines52.  
Short courses (<14 days) of corticosteroid s (at dosages equivale nt to prednisone ≤20 mg per day) 
for treatment of non-cancer-related  medical reasons are permitted. 
6.7.2 Prohibited Concomitant Therapy 
Any chemotherapy, other myelom
a-targeted ther apy including “IMiDs” (eg, lenalidomide) and 
proteasome inhibitors (eg, bortezomib), anti cancer immunotherapy, or corticosteroids are 
prohibited.  Experimental thera py and radiotherapy to treat the underlying myeloma disease are 
prohibited. 
Refer to Section 6.8.1.1 for guidance on drugs that  are CYP P450 inhibitors. 
Refer to Section 6.8.1.3 for guidance on use of anticoagulants. 
6.7.3 Guidelines for PCI-32765 Management  with Surgeries or Procedures  
PCI-32765 may increase risk of bleeding with inva sive procedures or surgery.  The following 
guidance should be applied during the perioperative period for s ubjects who require surgical 
intervention or an invasive pr ocedure while receiving PCI-32765: 
6.7.3.1 Minor Surgical Procedures 
For minor procedures (such as a central line pl acement, needle biopsy, lumbar puncture [other 
than shunt reservoir access], thor acentesis, o
r paracentesis) PCI-32765 should be held for at least 
3 days prior to the procedure and should not be re started for at least 3 days after the procedure.  
For bone marrow biopsies that are performed while the subject is  on PCI-32765, it is not 
necessary to holdCI-32765.   
6.7.3.2 Major Surgical Procedures 
For any surgery or invasive procedure requiring sutures or staples for closure, PCI-32765 should 
be held at least 7 days prior to the interventi on and should be held at least 7 days after the 
procedure and restarted at the disc retion of the investigator when the surgical site is reasonably 
healed without serosanguineous drainage or the need for drainage tubes.   
PCI-32765 (Ibrutinib) PCYC-1111-CA, Amendment 6  18 April 2016 
Pharmacyclics LLC Proprietary and Confidential Page 42 6.7.3.3 Emergency Procedures 
For emergency procedures, PCI-32765 should be held  as soon as possible and until the surgical 
site is reasonably healed or for at least 7 days after the urgent surgical procedure, whichever is 
longer. 
6.8 Precautions 
For complete information on precautions refer to the IB. 
6.8.1
 Medications to be Used w
ith Caution 
6.8.1.1 Concomitant Use of CYP Inhibiting/Inducing Drugs 
Ibrutinib is metabolized primarily by CYP3A4. Avoid co-administration with strong CYP3A4 or 
moderate CYP3A inhibitors and consider alte rnative agents with less CY
P3A inhibition.  
• If a strong CYP3A inhibitor (eg, ketoconazo le, indinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, 
saquinavir, clarithromycin, telithromycin, itr aconazole, nefazadone, or cobicistat) must 
be used, reduce ibrutinib dos e to 140 mg or withhold treatment for the duration of 
inhibitor use.  Subjects should be monito red for signs of ibrutinib toxicity.  
• If a moderate CYP3A inhibito r (eg, voriconazole, erythromyc in, amprenavir, aprepitant, 
atazanavir, ciprofloxacin, crizotinib, dar unavir/ritonavir, diltiazem, fluconazole, 
fosamprenavir, imatinib, verapamil, amiodar one, or dronedarone) must be used, reduce 
ibrutinib to 280 mg for those subjects receiv ing 840 mg and to 140 mg for those subjects 
receiving doses below 840 mg fo r the duration of the inhibitor use.  For subjects who are 
already on moderate CYP3A inhibitor concomit antly with ibrutinib without significant 
toxicity the investigator ma y consider the overall risk-b enefit to determine if a dose 
reduction of ibrutinib is a ppropriate.  Avoid grapefruit and Seville oranges during 
ibrutinib treatment, as these contain moderate inhibitors of CYP3A (see Section 6.3.1). 
• No dose adjustment is required in co mbination with mild inhibitors.  
Avoid concomitant use of strong CYP3A inducer s (eg, carbam
azepine, rifampin, phenytoin, and 
St. John’s Wort).  Consider alternative agents with less CYP3A induction. 
A list of common CYP3A inhibitors  and inducers is provided in 3Appendix 2. 
For further information, please refe r to the current version of the IB and examples of inhibitors, 
inducers, and substrates can be found at http://medicine.iupui.e du/clinpharm/ddis/main-table/.  
This website is continually revised and s hould be checked frequently for updates.  
6.8.1.2 Drugs That May Have Their Plasma Concentrations Altered by PCI-32765  
In vitro studies indicated that PCI-32765 is not a substrate of P-glycoprotein (P-gp), but is a mild 
inhibitor (with an IC 50 of 2.15 μ g/mL).  PCI-32765 is not expected  to have systemic drug-drug 
interactions with P-gp substrat es.  However, it cannot be excl uded that PCI-32765 could inhibit 
intestinal P-gp after a therapeutic dose.  There is no clinical data available.  Therefore, to avoid a 
PCI-32765 (Ibrutinib) PCYC-1111-CA, Amendment 6  18 April 2016 
Pharmacyclics LLC Proprietary and Confidential Page 43 potential interaction in the GI  track, narrow therapeutic range P-gp substrates such as digoxin 
should be taken at least 6 hours before or after PCI-32765 
6.8.1.3 Concomitant Use of Antiplatel et Agents and Anticoagulants 
Warfarin or other vitamin K antagonists should  not be administered concomitantly with 
PCI-32765.  Supplements such as fish oil and vi
tamin E preparations should be avoided.  
Use PCI-32765 with caution in subjects requiring other anticoagulants or me dications that inhibit 
platelet function.  Subjects with congenital bleedi ng diathesis have not been studied.  Ibrutinib 
should be held at least 3 to 7 days pre- and post-surgery depending upon the type of surgery and 
the risk of bleeding (see Section 6.7.3).   
Subjects requiring the initiation of therapeutic an ticoagulation therapy (e g. atrial fibrillation), 
consider the risk and benefit of
 continuing PCI-32765 treatment.  If therapeutic anticoagulation 
is clinically indicated, treatment  with ibrutinib should be held and not be restarted until the 
subject is clinically stable and has no signs of bleeding.  Subjects should  be observed closely for 
signs and symptoms of bleeding.  No dose reducti on is required when study drug is restarted. 
6.8.2 Reproductive Toxicity 
Reproductive toxicity studies have not been c onducted with PCI-32765.  Therefore, women of 
childbearing potential, who are sexu
ally active, must  use highly effective contraception (as listed 
in Section 5.2) during the study and for 30 days after th e last dose of study drug.  Men who are 
sexually active, must use highly effective co ntraception during the study and for 90 days 
(3 months) after the last dose of PCI-32765.  Subject s should promptly notify the investigator if 
they, or their partner, become pregnant during th is period.  If a fe
male subject becomes pregnant 
during the treatment period, she must disconti nue study drug immediately.   Pregnancy in a 
female subject or a male subject’s partner must be reported in the same manner as an SAE 
(Section 9.3.5). 
6.8.3 Overdose Instructions 
Any dose of study drug administered in excess of that specified in this protocol is considered to 
be an overdose.  Signs and symptoms of an overdose that meet any SAE criterion m
ust be 
reported as an SAE in the appropriate time fram e and documented as clin ical sequelae to an 
overdose ( Section 9.3.3).   
There is no specific experience in the management  of ibrutinib overdose in patients.  No MTD 
was reached
 in the Phase 1 study in whic h subjects received up to 12.5 mg/kg/day 
(1400 mg/day).  Healthy subjects were exposed  up to single dose of 1680 mg.  One healthy 
subject experienced reversible Grade 4 hepatic en zyme increases (AST and ALT) after a dose of 
1680 mg.  Subjects who ingested more than the recommended dosage should be closely 
monitored and given appropriate supportive treatment. 
Refer to Section 9.3 for further information regarding AE reporting.

The Schedule of Assessments is provided in Appendix 4.  
Descriptions of the scheduled evaluations are outlined below and complete information on study 
drug and dosing is provided in Section 6.0. 
Before study entry, throughout the study, and at the follow-up evaluation, various clinical and 
diagnostic laboratory evaluations are outline d.  The purpose of obtaining these detailed 
measurements is to ensure adequate safety and to lerability assessments.  Clinical evaluations and 
laboratory studies may be repeated more frequently if clinically indicated. 
7.1
 Description of Procedures 
7.1.1 Screening Assessments 
All routine laborato
ry and clinical screening as sessments must be performed within 21 days 
before the first administration of study dr ug, unless otherwise indicated (longer windows 
allowed for baseline radiologic studies).  All study-specific as
sessments that are not part of 
standard-of-care must be done after subjects sign the ICF. 
The following are required: Confirmation of Eligibility:  Perform all necessary procedures and evaluations to document that 
the subject meets each eligibility criterion ( Section 5.0).  De-identified copies of measurable 
disease as documented by SPEP, serum FLC an d UPEP is required prior to enrollment. 
Multip
le myeloma diagnosis will be confirmed as well as the stage at original diagnosis47 and 
current disease status (relapsed or relapsed a nd refractory) will be documented if all requisite 
clinical results are availa ble.  Please refer to the study manual for a more detailed description of 
the enrollment procedures. Medical History:  Collect and record the subject’s comple te medical history through review of 
medical records and by interview.  Concurrent medical signs and symptoms must be documented 
to establish baseline severities.  A disease histor y, including the date of in itial diagnosis and list 
of all prior anticancer treatments, and responses  and duration of respons e to these treatments, 
also will be recorded. Concomitant Medications and Therapy:  All concomitant medications and procedures will be 
collected within 14 days prio r to the start of study drug.  Prior use of denosumab and 
bisphosphates should also be recorded. Physical Examination, Vital Signs, Height, and Weight:  The screening physical examination 
(PE) will include, at a minimum, the general appe arance of the subject, height (screening only) 
PCI-32765 (Ibrutinib) PCYC-1111-CA, Amendment 6  18 April 2016 
Pharmacyclics LLC Proprietary and Confidential Page 45 and weight, and examination of the skin, eyes , ears, nose, throat, lungs, heart, abdomen, 
extremities, musculoskeletal system, ne rvous system, and lymphatic system. 
Vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, respirator y rate, and body temperat ure) will be assessed 
after the subject has been resting in the sitting position for at  least 3 minutes. 
ECOG Performance Status:  The ECOG index is provided in 3Appendix 1. 
Electrocardiogram:  Subjects should be in the supine  position for at least 10 minutes

Bone Radiological Assessment:  Repeated bone radiological assessments on study are not 
mandated by the protocol, but should follow institutional guidelines.  Bone radiological 
assessment includes a lateral radiog raph of the skull, an tero-posterior and lateral views of the 
spine, and antero-posterior views of the pelvis, ribs, femora, and humeri.  
Myeloma-Specific Tests43,48:  Myeloma-specific tests include M-protein quantification by SPEP 
and UPEP, as well as quantitative imm unoglobulins, Serum Free Light Chain (Freelite®), 
and β 2-microglobulin.  UPEP is performed on a timed  urine collection and should be recorded 
normalized to 24 hours.  Urine creatinine determin ations should be performed as well as UPEP 
on all urines collected for M-protein quantification. 
Myeloma-specific protein tests will be obtained at the beginning of each cycle.  These will 
include SPEP, UPEP, or SFLC (if measurable disease is present at baseline by these methods), 
quantitative immunoglobulins and β2-microglobulin.  If the M-protein is not measurable by 
either SPEP or UPEP that test may be omitted at subsequent visits.  If the M- protein is or 
becomes immeasurable by both methods, Serum Free Light Chain (Freelite®) determinations will 
additionally be performed at all vi sits thereafter.  Testing will be performed at the study center’s 
local laboratory or othe r clinical laboratory listed on the investigator’s Form FDA 1572. 
PCI-32765 (Ibrutinib) PCYC-1111-CA, Amendment 6  18 April 2016 
Pharmacyclics LLC Proprietary and Confidential Page 49 Measurable disease parameters (by serum and ur ine) must be repeated on Cycle 1 Day 1 prior 
to study drug administration unless performed within 5 days prior to the start of treatment.  
After Cycle 1, myeloma specific pr otein tests may be performed w ithin ±2 days of Day 1 of 
subsequent cycles. 
Cytokines and Chemokines:  Blood samples for serum cytokine and chemokine measurement 
will be collected on Days 1, 2, 8, and 15 of Cycle 1 and Day 1 of Cycles 2, 3, 4, 6 and 10.

Peripheral Blood Immunophenotyping by Flow Cytometry:  Blood samples for 
immunophenotyping of peripheral blood mononuclear cells will be collected on Days 1, 2, 8, 
and 15 of Cycle 1 and on Day 1 of Cycles 2, 3, 4, 6 and 10.  Markers may include, but are not 
limited to, CD138, CD19, CD3, CD45, and CD38.  Ce ntralized testing will be performed at 
Pharmacyclics LLC using overnight shipped samp les.  Refer to the laboratory manual for 
instructions on collecting a nd processing these samples. 
Tests of Bone Turnover:  Bone turnover measurements will occur on Cycle 1 Days 1 and 15, 
Cycles 2, 3, and 4 Day 1; thereafter, they will  be performed on Day 1 of the even numbered 
cycles.  Testing will include serum C-terminal cross-linking protein of type-1 collagen 
(serum CTX, CPT Code: 82523) and urinary N-term inal cross-linking peptide of type-1 collagen 
(urinary NTX, CPT Code: 82523; 82570).  Testing will be performed at a central laboratory.  
Refer to the laboratory manual for instructions  on collecting and pro cessing these samples. 
Confirmation of Responses:  Starting with Cycle 2, subjects will be evaluated for disease 
response criteria as detailed in Appendix 5.  Some or all of the following assessm ents may be 
required to confirm the response cate gories MR, PR, VGPR, CR, and sCR: 
• M-protein evaluations: 
¾ UPEP and SPEP  
¾ Serum IFE 
¾ Serum FLC 
• Plasmacytoma evaluation 
• Bone radiological assessment 
• Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy 
• Serum chemistries including calcium and albumin 
Plasmacytoma Evaluation:  Subjects with an extra-medullary  plasmacytoma that is known or 
detected at baseline should be monitored throughout the study using the same technique used to 
evaluate at screening or  baseline.  Therefore, a subcutane ous plasmacytoma that is readily 
measurable on physical examination should be  followed by repeated physical examination, 
PCI-32765 (Ibrutinib) PCYC-1111-CA, Amendment 6  18 April 2016 
Pharmacyclics LLC Proprietary and Confidential Page 50 with a CT or other clin ically appropriate imaging study requir ed only as needed to document CR.  
Follow-up of a deeply situated extra-medullary plasmacytoma should be in accordance with 
institutional guidelines, an appropriate imaging study is required to document a clinical response 
of PR or better. 
7.1.3 Safety Follow-up Visit 
Each subject should be followed for 30 (±7) days after the last dose of PCI-32765 or prior to the 
start of a new antineoplastic treatment to monitor for resolution or progression of AEs and to 
document the occurrence of any new AEs.  The pr ocedures required at the Safety Follow-up visit 
are presented in the Sch
edule of Assessments (Appendix 4). 
A bone marrow aspirate sample at the tim
e of co nfirmed progression may be collected during the 
Safety Follow-up visit or at any time prior to the start of a new antineoplastic treatment.  Refer to 
Section 4.3 for description of testing. 
7.1.4 Follow-up for Progression and Survival 
Subjects who discontinue from the study treatm
ent for reasons other than PD will be followed 
for Response Follow-up (RFU) approximately every 2 months until PD or start use of alternative 
antineoplastic therapy.  During this period, th e following tests may be performed at the 
investigator’s discretion as standard of care: 
• M-protein evaluations: 
¾ UPEP and SPEP 
¾ Serum IFE 
¾ Serum FLC 
¾ quantitative immunoglobulins 
• Plasmacytoma evaluation 
• Bone radiological assessment 
• Serum chemistries including calcium and albumin 
A bone marrow aspirate sample at the time of confirmed progression will be  collected during this 
period prior to the start of a new antineoplastic treatment.  Refer to Section 4.3 for description of 
testing. 
A minimu
m of one Long Term Follow Up visit will be performed. Further Long-term Follow-up 
assessments will no longer be collected.  
7.2 Missed Evaluations 
Missed evaluations should be resc heduled and performed as close to  the original scheduled date 
as possible.  An exception is made when resche duling becom
es, in the investigator’s opinion, 
PCI-32765 (Ibrutinib) PCYC-1111-CA, Amendment 6  18 April 2016 
Pharmacyclics LLC Proprietary and Confidential Page 51 medically unnecessary or unsafe becau se it is too close in time to  the next scheduled evaluation.  
In that case, the missed evaluation should be abandoned. 
7.3 Study Completion 
The expected duration of this study is approximate ly 5 years.  The study is considered completed 
when the last active subject discontinues PCI-327 65 and completes the Safety Follow-up visit or 
rolls over to another study, whichever occurs first.  
8.0 STATIS
TICAL METHODS OF ANALYSIS 
8.1 General Considerations 
This study is designed to assess the efficacy and safety of PCI-32765 both as a single agent and 
in combination with dexamethasone in subjects w ith relapsed and relapsed and refractory MM.   
For subjects in Cohorts 1 and 3, subjects will be on PCI-32765 monotherapy and may convert to 
PCI-32765 and dexamethasone combination therapy at the discretion of the investigator after a 
confirm
ed PD on PCI-32765 monotherapy.  Thus  the efficacy endpoints (DCB, ORR, DOR, 
PFS, TTP) will be presented and distinguished as with and without dexamethasone for subjects 
in Cohorts 1 and 3, when applicable. 
8.1.1 Response Assessment 
Response assessments will be made by the investigators using the modified IMWG response 
criteria ( Appendix 5
).43,44  Confirmation of investigator-asse ssed responses by an independent 
review committee (IRC) may be done as a suppor tive assessment.  The method of independent 
review will be governed by an IRC charter. 
8.2 Definition of Analysis Populations 
The following definitions will be used for the efficacy and safety analysis sets. 
• Modified ITT population:  All enrolled subjects who receiv
e ≥ 1 dose of study drug.  
• Safety analysis population:   All enrolled subjects who receive ≥ 1 dose of study drug. 
• Response evaluable population:   All enrolled subjects who receive ≥ 1 dose of study 
drug and undergo ≥ 1 response assessment af ter start of treatment. 
Unless otherwise specified, the Modified ITT popul ation will be the primary population used for 
analyzing the efficacy endpoints.  The response eval uable population will be used for sensitivity 
analysis for efficacy.  The Safety analysis popu lation will be used for analyzing the safety 
endpoints. 
PCI-32765 (Ibrutinib) PCYC-1111-CA, Amendment 6  18 April 2016 
Pharmacyclics LLC Proprietary and Confidential Page 52 8.3 Endpoint Data Analysis 
8.3.1 Demographic/Baseline Characteristics and Study Conduct 
Subject demographics (including age, sex, and r ace/ethnicity) and other baseline characteristics 
(including ECOG perform
ance status, disease burden, and number of prior therapies) will be 
summarized.  Summary statistics will include means, standard deviations, and medians for 
continuous variables and proportions for categorical variables.   
Further, compliance parameters (including numbe r of doses taken compared with number of 
doses that should have been taken) and concurrent treatments will also be similarly summarized. 
8.3.2 Primary Efficacy Endpoint 
The primary endpoint of the study is the CBR, de fined as the proportion of subjects achieving a 
MR or better as assessed by investig ator per modified IMWG criteria ( Appendix 5).43,44 
The primary efficacy analysis will be performe d in the Modified ITT population.  CBR and its 
corresponding 2-sided 90% exact binomial confidence interval will be calculated.  For subjects 
in Cohorts 1 and 3, CBR will be calculated during PCI-32765 monotherapy period as primary 
analysis.  CBR across the whole study cour se (including PCI-32765 and dexamethasone 
combination therapy period) will be calculated  and presented as secondary analysis.   
8.3.3 Secondary/Exploratory Efficacy Endpoints 
8.3.3.1 Duration of Clinical Benefit (DCB) 
Duration of clinical benefit (DCB) will include  only subjects with confirmed responses 
(MR or better).  DCB will be calculated fr
om the first observation of response to the time of PD, 
with death from causes other than progression censored.  Kaplan-Meier methodology will be 
used to estimate DOR and corresponding quartil es (including the median).  A 2-sided 95% 
confidence interval will be provided for the median DOR. 
8.3.3.2 Objective Response Rate (ORR) 
Objective response rate (ORR) is define d as the proportion of subjects achieving CR 
(including sCR) + PR (including VGPR) as a ssessed by investigator per modified IMWG 
criteria.  ORR and its corresponding 2-sided 90% exact binom
ial confidence interval will be 
calculated.  
8.3.3.3 Duration of Response (DOR) 
Duration of response (DOR) will include only subject s with confirmed responses (PR or better).  
DOR will be calculated from the first observation of response to the time of  PD, with death from 
causes other than progression censored.  Kaplan-Meier m
ethodology will be used to estimate 
DOR and corresponding quartiles (i ncluding the median).  A 2-si ded 95% confidence interval 
will be provided for the median DOR. 
PCI-32765 (Ibrutinib) PCYC-1111-CA, Amendment 6  18 April 2016 
Pharmacyclics LLC Proprietary and Confidential Page 53 8.3.4 Exploratory Endpoint 
8.3.4.1 Progression-free Survival (PFS) 
Progression-free survival (PFS) is defined as the duration from star t of the treatme
nt to PD or 
death (regardless of cause of death), whichever comes first.  Kaplan-Meier methodology will be 
used to estimate event-free curves and correspondi ng quartiles (including the median).  A 2-sided 
95% confidence interval will be  provided for the median PFS. 
8.3.4.2 Time to Progression (TTP) 
Time
 to progression (TTP) is defined as the durati on from start of treatment to PD, with deaths 
from causes other than progression censored.  Kaplan-Meier methodology will be used to 
estimate TTP and corresponding quartiles (includi ng the median).  A 2-sided 95% confidence 
interval will be provided for the median TTP. 
8.3.4.3 Overall Survival (OS) 
Overall surv
ival (OS) is defined as the durat ion from first study drug administration until the 
date of death from any cause.  Subjects who are know n to be alive as of data analysis cutoff date 
will be censored at their date last known aliv e.  Kaplan-Meier methodology will be used to 
estimate OS curves and corre sponding quartiles (inc luding the median).  A 2-sided 95% 
confidence interval will be provided for the median OS. 
8.3.5 Safety Endpoint 
Safe
ty summaries will include tabulations in the form of tables and listings.  The frequency 
(number and percentage) of treatment-emergent AEs will be reported by MedDRA® System 
Organ Class and Preferred Term.  Additional AE summaries will include AE frequency by 
AE severity and by relationship to study drug. 
Adverse events requiring permanent disc ontinuation of study drug will be summarized 
separately, both overall and by AE severi ty and by relationship to study drug.   
The incidence of clinically si gnificant abnormal laboratory va lues and vital signs will be 
summarized.   
8.3.6 Pharmacokinetics  
Plasma
 concentrations of PCI-32765 and metabolite PCI-45227) will be determined using a 
validated analytical method.  Other potential metabolites of PCI-32765 may be explored. 
Bioanalytical data from this study will be used  in noncompartmental PK analysis and also may 
be pooled with data from other studies performed with PCI-32765 in subjects with hematologic 
malignancies as part of a population PK analysis  using nonlinear mixed effects models.  For the 
population PK analysis, covariates that could potentially  correlate with plas ma PK parameters 
PCI-32765 (Ibrutinib) PCYC-1111-CA, Amendment 6  18 April 2016 
Pharmacyclics LLC Proprietary and Confidential Page 54 will be evaluated.  Pharmacokinetic relationships to  PD measures of efficacy or toxicity may also 
be explored.  The results of the population PK an alyses will be presented in a separate report. 
Plasma concentration for 4- β-hydroxycholesterol, a marker of CYP3A4 induction, will be 
determined using a validated analytical met hod at screening, pre-dose on Cycle 1 Days 1, 8, 
and Cycle 2 Day 1 for subjects in Cohort 4 expansion only.  4- β-hydroxycholesterol will be 
summarized using descriptive statistics. 
8.3.7 Exploratory Analyses  
Sam
ples of whole blood and bone marrow will be collected and may be subjected to Biomarker 
assays which will compare the expression levels of  proteins and genetic profile of a subject’s 
cancer cell genes prior and at the end of treatment.  These findings may offer some insight to the 
effects that the study drugs has on Multiple My eloma which can help researchers identify 
changes in key biomarkers to monitor disease stat us of patients and may offer a method to better 
categorize the disease.  If ther e is evidence that study drug stops working, tests will be performed 
to determine the mechanism of resistance that th e tumor cells have adap ted to prevent response 
to study drug treatment.  Some of these samples ma y be stored and tested later, as defined in the 
informed consent, as new and more  sensitive assays are developed. 
8.4 Handling of Missing Data 
Every eff
ort will be made to collect all data.  However, despite best efforts, it may be inevitable 
that missing or incomplete data are reported.  All missing or partial data will be presented in the 
subject data listing, as they are recorded on the CRF.   
Subjects lost to follow-up (or w ho dropped out) will be included in statistical analyses up to the 
point of their last evaluation.  Unless otherwis e specified, no imputation of values for missing 
data will be performed.  Details of handling missing data will be includ ed in the Statistical 
Analysis Plan. 8.5 Determination of Sample Size 
Cohort 1 was designed to detect a meaningful signal of activity while mi
nimizing risk of 
continuing enrollment under null conditions.  Cohor t 2-4 is designed to further explore the 
optimal regimen.  The sample size was esti mated for each cohort without multiplicity 
adjustment. 8.5.1 Cohort 1  
Subjects who m
eet the stated eligibility requ irements will be enrolled in the study.   
Full enrollment to Cohort 1 will be contingent upon Simon 2 stage design rules with a target 
sample size of 35 evaluable subjects based on meeting interim efficacy endpoints, ie, if 
≥ 2 CBRs are observed among the first 11 subjects  within Cohort 1.  This study cohort is 
designed to test the null hypothesis that the CBR of PCI-32765 monotherapy at a dose of 
PCI-32765 (Ibrutinib) PCYC-1111-CA, Amendment 6  18 April 2016 
Pharmacyclics LLC Proprietary and Confidential Page 55 420 mg/day is ≤ 10% (not clinically compelling) versus the alternative hypothesis that CBR will 
be ≥ 30% at a 1-sided signifi cance level of 5%, with 85%  power.  Observation of ≥  7 CBRs 
within an expanded cohort of 35 subjects will be considered c onsistent with the alternative 
hypothesis of CBR rate ≥ 30%. 
Although the design described abov e is setup to detect cohort specific CBRs of 30%, CBRs as 
low as 20% is still considered clinically meaningful, as the drug may be developed in 
combination therapy and/or in less heavily pre- treated populations.  With this 2-stage design, 
the probability to continue enrolling subjects fo r the second stage is approximately 0.68 if the 
true CBR rate is 20%.  
8.5.2 Cohorts 2-4 
Simon optim
al 2-stage study design is ut ilized in Cohorts 2, 3, and/or 4. 
Up to eighteen subjects will be enrolled to each  subsequent cohort (2-4).  Stage 1 enrollment to 
Cohorts 2, 3, and 4 will not be contingent upon resu lts of preceding cohorts.  Full enrollment to 
Cohort 2, 3, and 4 will be contingent upon Simon 2- stage design rules with a sample size of  up 
to 43 evaluable subjects based on meeti ng interim efficacy endpoints, ie, if ≥ 3 CBRs are 
observed among the first 18 subjects  within the subject cohort.  This design has 80% power to 
reject the null hypothesis of CBR ≤ 10%, at a 1-sided 5% signif icance level.  Observation of ≥ 8 
CBRs within an expanded cohort of up to 43 subj ects will be considered consistent with the 
alternative hypothesis of CBR rate ≥ 25%.  The enrollment of that cohort may be closed early for 
success once 8 CBRs observed. 
Sponsor maintains the prerogative to select regimen that gives optimal efficacy and safety results 
at interim analysis for further developmen t and suspend other cohorts at any time. 
This study design is not powered or intended to allow direct comparison of  percent CBR among 
the cohorts.  Results of this study will inform a lternative directions for future combination and 
single agent development in alte rnative MM study populations.   
8.6 Interim Analysis 
Each cohort will perform a futility interim
 analysis when stage 1 enrollment target met (Cohort 1 
11 subjects, Cohorts 2-4 18 subjec ts) and either all enrolled su bjects have evaluable response 
data (ie, completed 6 treatment cycles and the Cycle 7 Day 1 assessments or have discontinued 
treatment) or the number of clinical benefit resp onders met stage 2 enroll ment expansion criteria 
(≥ 2 for Cohort 1, ≥ 3 for Cohorts 2-4), whichever earlier.  Further enrollment will be halted until 
the cohort meet stage 2 enrollment expansion criter ia.  All enrolled subjects will be followed to 
further assess their responses.  Enrollment may resume earlier while waiting for the confirmation 
of response of the last cl inical benefit responder.

Pharmacyclics LLC Proprietary and Confidential Page 56 8.7 Final and Follow-up Analyses 
The final analysis will occur upon study completion. 
 The study is considered completed when 
the last active subject disconti nues PCI-32765 and completes the Sa fety Follow-up Visit or rolls 
over to another study, whichever occurs first.  
9.0 ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY 
Safety asses
sments will consist of monitoring and recording AEs and SAEs; measurements of 
protocol-specified hematology, clinical chemistr y, urinalysis, and othe r laboratory variables; 
measurement of protocol-specified  vital signs; and other protocol-s pecified tests that are deemed 
critical to the safety ev aluation of the study drug. 
9.1 Safety Monitoring 
The study's investigators and data 
coordinators are responsible for entering the data and safety of 
this study, including implementation of  the stopping rules for efficacy.  
All sites are required to use the eCRFs provi ded by the study sponsor.  All sites will be 
monitored on an ongoing basis by the study sponsor.  
Safety data is monitored in accordance with the sponsor's Pharmacovigilance Committee 
procedures.  Adverse events a nd serious adverse events will be  reviewed internally on an 
ongoing basis to identify safety concerns. 
9.2 Definitions   
9.2.1 Adverse Events 
An AE is any untoward me
dical occurrence in a subject administered a pharmaceutical product 
and that does not necessarily have  a causal relationship with this tr eatment.  An AE can therefore 
be any unfavorable and uninte nded sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), 
symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of an investigational study drug, 
whether or not considered related to the study drug. 
For the purposes of this clinical study, AEs in clude only treatment-emergent events that are 
either new or represent detectable ex acerbations of pre-existing conditions.  
Disease progression is not an AE; rather it may be the cause of an AE.  Adverse events that occur 
due to disease progression must be reported as all other treatme nt emergent AEs.  “Disease 
progression” should never be an AE. Adverse events may include, but are not limited to: 
• Subjective or objective symptoms spontaneous ly offered by the subject and/or observed 
by the investigator or study staff including laboratory abnormalities of clinical 
significance. 
PCI-32765 (Ibrutinib) PCYC-1111-CA, Amendment 6  18 April 2016 
Pharmacyclics LLC Proprietary and Confidential Page 57 • Adverse events experienced by the subject  through the completion of final study 
procedures. 
• Adverse events not previously observed in the subject that emerge during the 
protocol-specified AE reporting period, including signs or symptoms associated with 
MM that were not present before the AE reporting period ( Section 9.3.1). 
• Com
plications that occur as a result of pr otocol-mandated interventions (eg, invasive 
procedures such as biopsies). 
The following are NOT considered an AE: 
• Pre-existing Condition:   A pre-existing condition (doc umented on the medical history 
CRF) is not considered an AE unless the seve rity, frequency, or character of the event 
worsens during the study period. 
• Preplanned or Elective Hospitalization:   A hospitalization planned before signing the 
ICF is not considered an SAE, but rather a therapeutic intervention.  However, if during 
the pre-planned hospitalization an event occurs  that prolongs the hospitalization or meets 
any other SAE criteria, the event will be consid ered an SAE.  Surgeries or interventions 
that were under consideration, but not performed before enro llment in the study will not 
be considered serious if they are performe d after enrollment in the study for a condition 
that has not changed from its ba seline level.  Elective hospitalizations for social reasons, 
solely for the administration of therapy, or due to long tr avel distances are also not 
considered SAEs. 
• Diagnostic Testing and Procedures:   Testing and procedures should not to be reported 
as AEs or SAEs, but rather the cause for the test or procedure should be reported. 
9.2.2 Serious Adverse Event 
The terms “severe ” and “serious” are not s ynonymous.  “Severity” (or intensity) refers to the 
grade of an AE, whereas “serious” is
 a regulatory definition. 
An SAE (experience) or reaction is any unt oward medical occurrence that at any dose: 
• results in death (ie, the AE actually causes or leads to death). 
• is life-threatening (“life-threatening” is define d as an AE in which the subject was at risk 
of death at the time of the event.  It does not refer to an event th at hypothetically might 
have caused death if it were more severe.  If either the investigator or the Sponsor 
believes that an AE meets the definition of life-threatening, it will be considered 
life-threatening). 
• requires inpatient hospitalization > 24 hours or prolongation of ex isting hospitalization. 
• results in persistent or significant disability/i ncapacity (ie, the AE results in substantial 
disruption of the subject’s abilit y to conduct normal life functions). 
• is a congenital anomaly/birth defect. 
• is an important medical event that may not result in death, be imme diately life-threatening 
or require hospitalization but may be consid ered an SAE when, based upon appropriate 
medical judgment, in the event may jeopardi ze the subject or may require medical or 
PCI-32765 (Ibrutinib) PCYC-1111-CA, Amendment 6  18 April 2016 
Pharmacyclics LLC Proprietary and Confidential Page 58 surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in this definition.  
Examples of such events are intensive treatm ent in an emergency department or at home 
for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias  or convulsions that do not result in 
hospitalization; or development of  drug dependency or drug abuse.  
Given that the investigator’s pe rspective may be informed by having actually observed the event, 
and the Sponsor is likely to have broader knowle dge of the drug and its effects to inform its 
evaluation of the significance of the event, if eith er the Sponsor or the investigator believes that 
the event is serious, the event will be considered serious. 
9.2.3 Severity 
Definitions found in the CTCAE v4.0 will be us
ed fo r grading the severity (intensity) of AEs.  
The CTCAE v4.0 displays Grades 1 through 5 with uni que clinical descriptions of severity for 
each referenced AE.  Should a subject experi ence any AE not listed in the CTCAE v4.0, 
the following grading system should be used to assess severity: 
• Grade 1 (Mild AE) – experiences that ar e usually transient,  requiring no special 
treatment, and not interfering with the subject’s daily activities. 
• Grade 2 (Moderate AE) – experiences that in troduce some level of inconvenience or 
concern to the subject, and that may inte rfere with daily activities, but are usually 
ameliorated by simple therapeutic measures. 
• Grade 3 (Severe AE) – experiences that are unacceptable or intolerable, significantly 
interrupt the subject’s usual daily activity, and require sy stemic drug therapy or other 
treatment. 
• Grade 4 (Life-threatening or di sabling AE) – experien ces that cause the subject to be in 
imminent danger of death. 
• Grade 5 (Death related to AE) – experi ences that result in subject death. 
9.2.4 Causality 
The investigator is to a
ssess the causal relation (ie, whether there is a reasonable possibility that 
the study drug caused the event) using the following definitions: 
Unrelated: Another cause of the AE is more plau sible; a temporal sequence cannot be 
established with the onset of the AE and administration of the 
investigational product; or, a causal relationship is considered biologically 
implausible. 
Possibly Related: There is a clinically plausi ble time sequence between onset of the AE and 
administration of the investigational product, but the AE could also be 
attributed to concurrent or underlying disease, or the use of other drugs or 
procedures.  Possibly related should be used when the investigational 
product is one of several biologically plausible AE causes. 
Definitely Related: The AE is clearly rela ted to use of the investigational product. 
PCI-32765 (Ibrutinib) PCYC-1111-CA, Amendment 6  18 April 2016 
Pharmacyclics LLC Proprietary and Confidential Page 59 9.2.5 Unexpected Adverse Events 
An “unexpected” AE is an AE that is not listed in the IB or is not listed at the sp
ecificity or 
severity that has been observed.  For example, hepatic necrosis would be “unexpected” (by virtue 
of greater severity) if the IB referred only to elevated hepatic enzymes or hepatitis.  Similarly, 
cerebral thromboembolism and cereb ral vasculitis would be “unexpe cted” (by virtue of greater 
specificity) if the IB listed only cerebral vascular accidents.  “Unexpected” also refers to AEs 
that are mentioned in the IB as occurring with  a class of drugs or as anticipated from the 
pharmacological properties of the drug, but are not specifically mentioned as occurring with the 
study drug under investigation. 
9.3 Documenting and Reporting of Adverse and Serious Adverse Events by 
Investigato
rs 
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that all AEs and SAEs  that are observed or reported 
during the study, as outlined in the prior sections , are recorded on the el ectronic CRF (eCRF).  
All SAEs also must be reported on the SAE form (Section 9.3.3). 
9.3.1 Adverse Event Reporting Period 
The AE reporting period for this study begins with  the first dose of study drug  and ends 30 days 
following the last dose of study drug.  SAEs occu rring after 30 days following the last dose of 
study drug should also be reported to the Sponsor if  considered related to study drug.  If an SAE 
is present at
 the Safety Follow-up visit, the SAE (and associated AEs and concomitant 
medications) should be followed to resolution or until the investigator assesses the subject as 
stable or the subject is lost to follow-up or withdraws consent.   Resolution/stable means the 
subject has returned to baseline state of health  or the investigator doe s not expect any further 
improvement or worsening of the event. 
If a death occurs within 30 days  after the last dose of study dr ug (even if the Safety Follow-up 
visit has already occurred), the death must be reported to the Sponsor as an SAE. 
9.3.2 Assessment of Adverse Events 
Investigators will as
sess the occurrence of AEs and SAEs at all subject evaluation time points 
during the study.  All AEs and SAEs, whether volunteered by the subject, discovered by study 
personnel during questioning, or det ected through PE, clinically si gnificant labora tory testing, 
or other means, will be recorded in the subj ect’s medical record and on the AE eCRF and, 
when applicable, on an SAE form. Each recorded AE or SAE will be described by it s duration (ie, start and end dates), severity, 
regulatory seriousness criteria, if applicable, suspected relationshi p to the investigational product 
and any actions taken. 
PCI-32765 (Ibrutinib) PCYC-1111-CA, Amendment 6  18 April 2016 
Pharmacyclics LLC Proprietary and Confidential Page 60 9.3.3 Expedited Reporting Requirements for Serious Adverse Events 
All SAEs (initial and follow-up inform
ation) will be reported on an SAE form and will be 
emailed or faxed to Pharmacyclics Drug Safety, or  designee, within 24 hour s of the discovery of 
the event or information.  Pharmacyclics may request follow-up and other additional information 
from the investigator (eg, hospital admission/discharge notes  and laboratory results).  
The contact information (email/fax) for Pharm acyclics Drug Safety can be found on the SAE 
Report Form. 
All deaths should be reported with the primary cause of death as the AE term, as death is 
typically the outcome of the event, not the even t itself.  The primary cause of death on the 
autopsy report should be the term reported.  Au topsy and postmortem reports must be forwarded 
to Pharmacyclics Drug Safety, or designee, as outlined above. 
If study drug is discontinued due to an SAE, this information must be included in the SAE 
report. 
9.3.4 Events of Special Interest 
Specific AEs, or groups of AEs, will be followed as  part of standard safe ty monitoring activ
ities 
by the Sponsor.  These events (regardless of serious ness) will be reported to the Sponsor within 
24 hours of awareness following the procedure described above for SAEs ( Section 9.3.3) and 
will require enhanced data collec
tion.  All Events of Special Interest will be submitted 
without a serious criterion selected if no other serious criterion is met.  
9.3.4.1 Major Hemorrhage 
Major hemorrhage is defi
ned as any of the following:  
• Any treatment-emergent hemorrhagic adverse events of Grade 3 or higher*. 
• Any treatment-emergent serious advers e events of bleeding of any grade 
• Any treatment-emergent central  nervous system hemorrhage/hematoma of any grade 
*All hemorrhagic events requiring transfusion of red blood cells should be reported as grade 3 or higher AE per 
CTCAE. 
Events meeting the definition of major hemorrhage will be captured as an event of special 
interest according to Section 9.3.4 above. 
9.3.5 Pregnancy 
Before study enrollment, subjects must agree to take appropriate m
easures to avoid pregnancy.  
However, should a pregnancy occur (including fema le partners of male subjects), consent to 
provide follow-up information regarding the outc ome of the pregnancy and the health of the 
infant until 30 days old will be requested. 
PCI-32765 (Ibrutinib) PCYC-1111-CA, Amendment 6  18 April 2016 
Pharmacyclics LLC Proprietary and Confidential Page 61 A female subject must imme diately inform the inves tigator if the subject becomes pregnant from 
the time of consent to 30 days after the la st dose of study drug or a male subject must 
immediately inform the investigator if the subj ect’s partner becomes pregnant from the time of 
consent to 3 months after the last dose of study drug.  Any fe male subjects receiving PCI-32765 
capsules who become pregnant must immedi ately discontinue the use of study drug.  
The investigator should counsel the subject, discussing any risks of continuing the pregnancy and 
any possible effects on the fetus. 
Although pregnancy itself is not regarded as an  AE, the outcome will need to be documented.  
Report any pregnancy that occurs in a subject or subj ect’s partner from the time of consent to 
30 days after the last dose of  study drug.  Record any occurrence of pregnancy on the Pregnancy 
Report Form Part I and email or fax to Pharm acyclics Drug Safety, or designee, within 24 hours 
of learning of the event.  The pregnant female will be followed for outcome, which is defined as 
elective termination of the pregnancy, miscarriage, or delivery of the fetus.  For pregnancies with 
an outcome of live birth, the newborn infant will be followed until 30 days old by completing the Pregnancy Report Form Part II.  Any congenital anom aly/birth defect noted in  the infant must be 
reported as a SAE. 
9.3.6 Other Malignancies 
In addition to all routine AE reporting, all new malignant tumors including solid tum
ors, skin 
malignancies and hematologic malignancies are to be reported for the dura tion of study including 
the post-progression follow-up pe riod for overall survival. 
9.4 Reporting of Serious Adverse Events by Sponsor 
Regulatory Authorities, Institutional Revi ew Boards/Indepen
dent Ethics Committees 
(IRBs/IECs), and Principal Investigators will be no tified of SAEs in accord ance with applicable 
requirements (eg, GCPs, ICH guidelines, national regulations, and local requirements).   
10.0 STUDY ADMINISTRATION AND INVESTIGATOR OBLIGATIONS 
Pharmacyclics retains the right to term
inate the study and remove all study materials from a 
study site at any time.  Specific circumstances that may precipitate such termination are: 
• Unsatisfactory subject enrollment with regard to quality or quantity 
(eg, < 12 subjects enrolled within 12 months of st arting the study). 
• Significant or numerous deviations from study pr otocol requirements, such as failures to 
perform required evaluations on subjects and maintain adequa te study records. 
• Inaccurate, incomplete and/or late da ta recording on a recurrent basis. 
• The incidence and/or severity of AEs in this or other studies indicate a potential health hazard caused by the study treatment. 
PCI-32765 (Ibrutinib) PCYC-1111-CA, Amendment 6  18 April 2016 
Pharmacyclics LLC Proprietary and Confidential Page 62 10.1 Institutional Review Board and Independent Ethics Committee 
The investigator will submit this protocol, th e ICF, IB, and any other relevant supporting 
information (eg, all advertising m
aterials or materi als given to the subject during the study) to the 
appropriate IRB/IEC for review and approval before study ini tiation.  Amendments to the 
protocol and ICF must also be approved by the IRB/IEC before the implementation of changes in 
this study. 
The investigator is responsible for providing th e IRB/IEC with any required information before 
or during the study, such as SAE expedited reports or study progress reports. The IRB/IEC must comply with cu rrent US regulations (§21 CFR 56)  as well as country-specific 
national regulations and/or local laws. The following documents must be provided to Phar macyclics or its authorized representative, 
before entering subjects in this study:  (1) a copy of the IRB/IEC letter that grants formal 
approval and (2) a copy of th e IRB/IEC-approved ICF.  
10.2 Informed Consent  
The ICF and process must comply with the Un ited States regulations (§ 21 CFR Part 50) 
as well as co
untry specific national regulations  and/or local laws.  The ICF will document the 
study-specific information the investigator or his/her designee provides to the subject and the 
subject’s agreement to participate.   The investigator, or designee (d esignee must be listed on the Delegation of Authority log), 
must explain in terms understandable to the subj ect the purpose and nature  of the study, the study 
procedures, anticipated benefits, potential risks, the possible adverse effects, and any discomfort 
participation in the study may entail.  Each s ubject must provide a signed and dated ICF before 
any study-related (nonstandard of  care) activities are performed (such as screening).  
The original and any amended signed and dated consent forms must remain in each subject’s 
study file at the study site and be available for verification by  study monitors at any time.  
A copy of each signed consent form must be given to the subject at the time that it is signed by 
the subject. 
10.3 Protected Subject Health Information Authorization 
Information on maintain
ing subjec t confidentiality in accordance to  individual local and national 
subject privacy regulations must be provided to each subject as part of the informed consent 
process (refer to Section 10.2), either as part of the ICF or as a separate signed document 
(for exam
ple, in the US, a site-specific Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act 
consent may be used).  The investigator or desi gnee must explain to each subject that for the 
evaluation of study results, the subject’s protec ted health information obtained during the study 
may be shared with Pharmacyclics and its desi gnees, regulatory agenci es, and IRBs/IECs.  
As the study sponsor, Pharmacyclics will not use the subject’s protected health information or 
PCI-32765 (Ibrutinib) PCYC-1111-CA, Amendment 6  18 April 2016 
Pharmacyclics LLC Proprietary and Confidential Page 63 disclose it to a third party wit hout applicable subject authorization.  It is the investigator’s or 
designee’s responsibility to obtain written permi ssion to use protected health information from 
each subject.  If a subject wit hdraws permission to use protected health information, it is the 
investigator’s responsibility to obtain the withdrawal request in writing from the subject and to 
ensure that no further data will be collected from the subject.  Any data collected on the subject 
before withdrawal will be used in the analysis of study results. 
During the review of source documents by the mon itors or auditors, the confidentiality of the 
subject will be respected with strict adhere nce to professional standards and regulations. 
10.4 Subject Screening Log 
The investigator m
ust keep a record that list s all subjects considered for enrollment (including 
those who did not undergo screening) in the study .  For those subjects subsequently excluded 
from enrollment, record the reason(s) for exclusion. 
10.5 Source Documentation Requirements 
The investigator/study staff must ma
intain adequate and accurate  records to enable the conduct 
of the study to be fully documented and the study  data to be subsequently verified.  Source 
documentation for this study will include, but not  be limited to, worksheets, hospital and/or 
clinic or office records documenting subject visits including study and other treatments or 
procedures, medical history and PE informati on, laboratory and special assessments results, 
pharmacy records, drug accountability records, and medical consultati ons (as applicable). 
10.6 Case Report Forms 
Electronic case report fo
rms will be used to colle ct the clinical study data and must be completed 
for each enrolled subject with all required st udy data accurately recorded such that the 
information matches the data contained in medi cal records (eg, physicians’ notes, nurses’ notes, 
clinic charts and other study-specific source doc uments).  Authorized study site personnel 
(ie, listed on the Delegation of Authority form) will complete eCRFs designed for this study 
according to the completion guidelines that will be provided.  The investigator will ensure that 
the eCRFs are accurate, complete, legible, and comp leted as soon as reasonably possible.  At all 
times, the investigator has final responsibility fo r the accuracy and authenticity of all clinical 
data. 
The eCRFs exists within an electronic data capture (EDC) system with controlled access 
managed by Pharmacyclics or its authorized re presentative for this study.  Study staff will be 
appropriately trained in the use of  eCRFs and application of electro nic signatures before the start 
of the study and before being given access to the EDC system.  Original data and any changes of 
data will be recorded using the EDC system, with  all changes tracked by the system and recorded 
in an electronic audit trail.  Th e investigator attests that the information contained in the eCRFs 
is true by providing electronic si gnature within the EDC system.  After database lock, the 
PCI-32765 (Ibrutinib) PCYC-1111-CA, Amendment 6  18 April 2016 
Pharmacyclics LLC Proprietary and Confidential Page 64 investigator will receive a copy of the subject data (eg, paper,  CD-ROM or other appropriate 
media) for archiving at the study site. 
10.7 Study Monitoring/Audit Requirements 
Representatives of Pharmacyclics or its de s
ignee will monitor this study until completion.  
Monitoring will be conducted through personal visits  with the investigator and site staff as well 
as any appropriate communications by mail, fax, email, or telephone.  The purpose of monitoring 
is to ensure that the study is conducted in compliance with the protocol, standard operating 
procedures (SOPs), and other written instructions and regulatory guidelin es, and to endure the 
quality and integrity of the data.  This st udy is also subject to reviews or audits. 
To assure the accuracy of data collected in th e CRFs, it is mandatory th at the monitor/auditor 
have access to all original source documents at  reasonable times and upon reasonable notice.  
During the review of source documents, every effort  will be made to main tain the anonymity and 
confidentiality of all subjects dur ing this clinical study.  However, because of the experimental 
nature of this treatment, the investigator ag rees to allow the IRB/IEC, representatives of 
Pharmacyclics, its designated agents, and author ized employees of the appropriate regulatory 
agencies to inspect the facilities used in this study and, for purposes of verification, allow direct 
access to the hospital or clinic record s of all subjects enrolled into this study.  A statement to this 
effect will be included on the ICF and permission from authorizing the use of protected health 
information. 
Pharmacyclics or its authorized representative ma y perform an audit at any time during or after 
completion of this study.  All study-related doc umentation must be made available to the 
designated auditor.  In addition, a representative of the FDA or other Regulatory Agencies may 
choose to inspect a study site at  any time before, during, or after completion of the clinical study.  
In the event of such an inspecti on, Pharmacyclics will be available to assist in the preparation.  
All pertinent study data should be made available as requested to the Regulatory Authority for 
verification, audit, or inspection purposes. 
10.8 Investigational Study Drug Accountability 
PCI-32765 capsules mu
st be kept in a locked lim ited access room.  The study drug must not be 
used outside the context of the pr otocol.  Under no circumstances should the investigator or other 
site personnel supply PCI-32765 capsules to other i nvestigators, subjects, or clinics or allow 
supplies to be used other than as directed by this protocol without prior authorization from 
Pharmacyclics. 
PCI-32765 capsules accountability records must be maintained and readily available for 
inspection by representatives of Pharmacyc lics and are open to inspections by regulatory 
authorities at any time.  
PCI-32765 (Ibrutinib) PCYC-1111-CA, Amendment 6  18 April 2016 
Pharmacyclics LLC Proprietary and Confidential Page 65 Each shipment of PCI-32765 capsules will contai n a Clinical Supplies Shipping Receipt Form 
(CSSF) that must be appended to the site’s drug accountability records.  Additionally a Drug 
Reorder Form for requesting more PCI-32765 capsules is provided in the pharmacy manual.  If it 
is used, the Drug Reorder Form must also be incl uded in the site’s drug acc ountability records.   
Contents of each shipment must be visually inspected to verify the quantity and document the 
condition of PCI-32765 capsules.  Then the designat ed recipient completes and signs the CSSF.  
A copy of the signed CSSF must be faxed or maile d to Pharmacyclics at the fax number/mailing 
address listed on the form. 
An Investigational Drug Accountability Log must be used for drug accountability.  For accurate 
accountability, the following information must be noted when drug supplies are used during the 
study: 
1. study identification number (PCYC-1111-CA). 
2. subject identification number. 
3. lot number(s) of PCI-32765 capsules dispensed for that subject. 
4. date and quantity of drug dispensed. 
5. any unused drug returned by the subject. 
At study initiation, the monitor will evaluate and a pprove the site’s proced ure for investigational 
product disposal/destruction to ensu re that it complies with Pharmacy clics’ requirements.  If the 
site cannot meet Pharmacyclics’ requirements  for disposal/destruction, arrangements will be 
made between the site and Pharmacyclics or  its representative, for return of unused 
investigational product.  Before disposal/destr uction, final drug accountability and reconciliation 
must be performed by the monitor. 
All study supplies and associated documentation w ill be regularly reviewed and verified by the 
monitor. 
10.9 Financial Disclosure 
A separate financial agre
ement will be made between each Principal Investigator and 
Pharmacyclics or its authorized representa tive before the study drug is delivered. 
For this study, each investigator and subinvest igator (as designated on the Form FDA 1572) 
will provide a signed Financial Disclosure  Form in accordance with §21 CFR 54.  
Each investigator will notify Pharmacyclics or its  authorized representative of any relevant 
changes during the conduct of the study and for 1 year after the study has been completed. 
10.10 Availability and Retention of Records 
The investigator and other appr opriate study staff are responsible  for m
aintaining all essential 
documentation relevant to the study.  Essential documentation includes, but is not limited to, the 
PCI-32765 (Ibrutinib) PCYC-1111-CA, Amendment 6  18 April 2016 
Pharmacyclics LLC Proprietary and Confidential Page 66 IB, signed protocols and amendments, IRB/IEC approval letters (dated), signed Form FDA 1572 
and Financial Disclosure, signed ICFs (including subject confidentiality information), drug 
dispensing and accountability reco rds, shipping records of in vestigational product and study-
related materials, signed (ele ctronically), dated and complete d CRFs, and documentation of CRF 
corrections; SAE forms transmitted to Pharmacy clics and notification of SAEs and related 
reports, source documentation, normal laboratory  values; decoding pro cedures for blinded 
studies; curricula vita e for study staff, all relevant correspondence, and other documents 
pertaining to the c onduct of the study. 
Subject identity information will be maintained for 15 years.  All other essential documentation will be retained by the investigator for at least 2 years after the date the last marketing 
application is approved for the drug for the indica tion for which it is being investigated and until 
there are no pending or contemplated  marketing applicati ons; or, if no applica tion is to be filed 
or if the application is not a pproved for such indication, until 2 years after formal discontinuation 
of clinical development of the drug.  
The investigator must notify Pharmacyclics a nd obtain written approval from Pharmacyclics 
before destroying any clinical study docum ents or images (eg, scan, radiograph, 
electrocardiogram tracing) at any time.  Should an  investigator wish to assign the study records 
to another party or move them to another location, advance written notice will be given to 
Pharmacyclics.  Pharmacyclics will inform the inve stigator of the date that study records may be 
destroyed or return to Pharmacyclics. 
Pharmacyclics must be notified in advance of, and Pharmacyclics must provide express written 
approval of, any change in the maintenance of th e foregoing documents if the investigator wishes 
to move study records to another location or assign responsibility for record retention to another 
party.  If the investigator cannot  guarantee the archiving requirement s set forth herein at his or 
her study site for all such documents, special  arrangements must be made between the 
investigator and Pharmacyclics to store such docum ents in sealed containers away from the study 
site so that they can be returned sealed  to the investigator  for audit purposes. 
10.11 Protocol Amendments 
Pharmacyclics will initia
te any change to the pr otocol in a protocol amendment document.  The 
amendment will be submitted to the IRB/IEC together  with, if applicable, a revised model ICF.  
Written documentation of IRB/IEC approval must be received by Pharmacyclics before the 
amendment may take effect at each site.  Addi tionally under this circumstance, information on 
the increased risk and/or change in scope mu st be provided to subjects already actively 
participating in the study, and they must rea d, understand, and sign any revised ICF confirming 
willingness to remain in the study. 
PCI-32765 (Ibrutinib) PCYC-1111-CA, Amendment 6  18 April 2016 
Pharmacyclics LLC Proprietary and Confidential Page 67 No other significant or consistent change in  the study procedures, except to eliminate an 
immediate hazard, shall be effected without th e mutual agreement of the investigator and 
Pharmacyclics. 
10.12 Use of Information and Publication  
All information, including but not lim
ited to information regarding PCI-32765 or the Sponsor’s 
operations (eg, patent application, formulas, manu facturing processes, basic scientific data, 
prior clinical data, formulation information) s upplied by the Sponsor to the investigator and not 
previously published, and any data  generated as a result of this  study, are considered confidential 
and remain the sole property of the Sponsor.  The investigator agrees to maintain this 
information in confidence and use this inform ation only to accomplish this study, and will not 
use it for other purposes without the Sponsor’s prior wr itten consent. 
The investigator understands that the information developed in the clinical study will be used by 
the Sponsor in connection with  the continued development of PCI-32765, and thus may be 
disclosed as required to other clinical investigators or regul atory agencies.  To permit the

Pharmacyclics LLC Proprietary and Confidential Page 75 Appendix 3. Multiple Myel oma Diagnostic Criteria 
Subject must have been previously diagnosed with multiple myeloma (MM) based on either 
standard diagnostic criteria49 or by the International Myeloma Working Group Diagnostic 
(IMWG) Criteria.43  In addition, at least 1 of the “CRAB” conditions must be met for 
documentation of symptomatic myeloma requiring systemic therapy,43 along with either disease 
diagnostic criteria: 
Standard Criteria49 
Any of the following sets of criteria will confirm the diagnosis of MM: 
1. Any 2 of the ma jor criteria. 
2. Major criterion 1 plus minor  criteria b, c, or d. 
3. Major criterion 3 plus minor criteria a or c. 
4. Minor criteria a, b, and c;  or criteria a, b, and d. 
Major Criteria 
a) Plasmacytomas on tissue biopsy. 
b) Bone marrow plasmacytosis (>30% plasma cells). 
c) Monoclonal immunoglobulin spike on seru m electrophoresis immunoglobulin G (IgG) 
> 3.5 g/dL or immunoglobulin A (IgA) > 2.0 g/dL ; kappa or lambda light chain excretion 
> 1g/day on 24-hour urine protein electrophoresis. 
Minor Criteria  
a. Bone marrow plasmacytosis (1 0% to 30% plasma cells). 
b. Monoclonal immunoglobulin presen t, but of lesser magnitude than given under major 
criteria. 
c. Lytic bone lesions. 
d. Normal (non-M protein) IgM < 50 mg/dL,  IgA < 100 mg/dL, or IgG < 600 mg/dL. 
  
PCI-32765 (Ibrutinib) PCYC-1111-CA, Amendment 6 18 April 2016 
Pharmacyclics LLC Proprietary and Confidential Page 76 IMWG Criteria for MM Re quiring Systemic Therapy43 
Monoclonal protein (M-component) pres ent in the serum and/or urinea plus monoclonal plasma 
cells in the bone marrow ≥ 10% and/or presence of a biopsy-proven plasmacytoma  
CRAB criteria of the IMWG,43 1 or more required for diagnosis of symptomatic myelomab 
[C] Calcium, serum ≥ 11.5 mg/dL or > upper limit of normal  
[R] Renal:  serum creatinine > 2 mg/dL 
[A] Anemia:  hemoglobin < 10 g/dL or 2 g < normal 
[B] Lytic B one lesions, severe osteoporos is, or pathologic fracturesc 
a If no monoclonal protein is detected (non-secretory disease), then > 30% monoclonal bone marrow plasma 
cells and/or a biopsy-proven plasmacytoma required for IMWG diagnosis; however subjects with non-
secretory myeloma are not eligible to participate in this study. 
b A variety of other types of end organ dysfunctions can occasionally occur and lead to a need for therapy.  
Such dysfunction is sufficient to support classification of myeloma if proven to be myeloma related.  
c If a solitary (biopsy-proven) plasmacytoma or osteopor osis alone (without fractures) are the sole defining 
criteria, then > 30% plasma cells are required in the bone marrow.

Pharmacyclics LLC Proprietary and Confidential Page 79  j. A unilateral bone marrow aspirate and biopsy documenting percent marro w involvement will be done at screening.  Bone marrow asp iration and biopsy are to be 
evaluated for morphology locally.  Samples will be sent to  a central laboratory for further evaluation.  Refer to Section 4.3 for a list of correlative assessments to be 
performed.  Bone marrow for  co
nfirmation of CR should include staining for CD138 and κ/λ  clonality by immunohistochemistry or immunof luorescence. A unilateral 
bone marrow aspirate sample will be collected at the time of suspected CR.  It will al so be collected following confirmed disea se progression and will be performed any 
time prior to the start of a new antineoplastic treatment. 
k. Hematology includes complete blood count with differential and platelet counts. 
l. Serum chemistry includes albumin, alkaline phosphatase, alanine tr ansaminase, aspartate transami nase, bicarbonate, blood urea n itrogen, calcium, chloride, creatinine, 
glucose, lactate dehydrogenase, magnesi um, phosphate, potassium, sodium, total bilir ubin, total protein, and uric acid. 
m. Urinalysis includes pH, ketones, specific grav ity, bilirubin, protein,  blood, and glucose. 
n. Pregnancy tests are required only for women of childbearing poten tial.  If positive, pregnancy must be ruled out by ultrasound to be eligible for participation in the study. 
o. PK time points: Please refer to Section 7.1.2  for tables summarizing PK collection timepoints for each specific cohort 
p. Bone radiological assessment include s a lateral radiograph of the skull, antero-pos terior and lateral views of the spine, and a ntero-posterior views of the pelvis, ribs, 
femora, and humeri. Repeated bone radiological assessment on study is not managed by the protoc ol, but should follow institutio nal guidelines. 
q. Quantitative serum immunoglobulin: IgG,  IgM, and IgA by nephelometry. 
r. Myeloma protein tests will be pe rformed at screening, predose Cycle 1 Day 1 and at  the beginning of each subsequent cycle and i nclude M-protein quantification by 
serum protein electrophoresis, a timed urine collection for urine M-protein quantification by urine protein electrophoresis (when urinary M protein has been detectable), 
immunofixation (IFE), quantitative immunoglobulins and β2-microglobulin.  Cycle 1 Day 1 SPEP requi red, other tests may be omitted if performed within 5 days prior to 
Day 1 as screening tests.  Crea tinine excretion should also be measured on all 24 hour urine collections. If the M protein initially or becomes non-measurable by both 
SPEP and UPEP, serum free light chain determ inations will additiona lly be performed.  
s. β2-microglobulin will also be tested at screening, predose Cycl e 1 Day 1, and at the beginni ng of each cycle. Cycle 1 Day 1 β2-microglobulin may be omitted if 
determined within 5 days prio r to Day 1 as screening test.

u. Response to treatment. Some or all of the following assessments may be required to c onfirm the response categories of MR, PR, V GPR, CR, and sCR according to 
Appendix 5.  M protein evaluations includ ing UPEP, SPEP, IFE, and serum FLC; plasmacytoma evaluation, bone radiological assessment; bone marrow aspiration and 
biopsy; and serum chemistries including calcium and albumin. 
v. If present at baseline, plasmacytomas shoul d be followed per institutional guidelines, using the same techniques, if possible, used at screening or at baseline to assess the 
plasmacytoma(s).  Measurements need to be  incorporated in the response assessment ( Appendix 5 ).

CATEGORY RESPONSE CRITERIA a 
Progressive Disease 
(PD) Any one or more of the following: 
• Increase of 25% from lowest value in g: 
 Serum M-component (absolute increase must be ≥0.5 g/dL)c  
 Serum M-component increase ≥1 g/dL, if starting M component 
was ≥5 g/dL  
 Urine M-component (absolute increase must be ≥ 200 mg/24 h) c 
 If at on study, the only measurable non-bone marrow parameter 
was FLC, the difference between involved and uninvolved FLC 
levels (absolute increase must be >10 mg/dL) c  
 Bone marrow plasma cell percentage (absolute % must be ≥10%)c 
Or any one or more of the following felt related to the underlying clonal 
plasma cell proliferative disorder  
 Development of new soft tissue plasmacytomas or bone lesions  
 Hypercalcemia ( ≥11.5 mg/dL)
Relapse from CR or 
sCR d Subject who has achieved confirmed CR who has any one or more of 
the following:  
• Reappearance of serum or urine M-protein by immunofixation or 
electrophoresis  
• Development of ≥5% plasma cells in the bone marrow f 
• Appearance of any other sign of progression (i.e., new plasmacytoma, 
lytic bone lesion, or hypercalcemia)
a All response categories require two consecutive assessmen ts made at any time before the institution of any new 
therapy; complete response and PR, MR and SD categories also require no known evidence of progressive or 
new bone lesions if radiographic studies were performed. Radiographic studies are not required to satisfy these 
response requirements. Bone marrow assessments need not be confirmed.  
b Presence/absence of clonal cells is based upon the k/  ratio. An abnormal k/  ratio by immunohistochemistry 
and/or immunofluorescence requires a minimum of 100 plasma cells for analysis. An abnormal ratio reflecting 
presence of an abnormal clone is k/  of >4:1 or <1;2.  
c Positive immunofixation alone in a subject previously classified as CR will not be considered progression. 
d This category will ONLY be used to analyze disease free survival 
e This response category is not available for those subjects being followed by bone marrow only. 
f  Relapse from CR has the 5% cutoff versus 10% for other categories of relapse. 
g In the case where a value is felt to be a spurious result per physician discretion (for example, a possible lab 
error), that value will not be considered when determining the lowest value.

Pharmacyclics LLC Proprietary and Confidential Page 82  Confirmation of Response Categories  
In order to be classified as a hematologic response, confirmation of serum monoclonal protein, 
serum immunoglobulin free light chain (when primar y determinant of response) and urine monoclonal 
protein (when primary determinant of response) results must be made by verification on two consecutive determinations.  Confirmation assessments may be pe rformed at any time after the initial assessment.   
• Bone marrow aspirate/biopsy is only required to document CR or sCR, except for subjects with bone 
marrow plasmacytosis evaluable disease only, where a bone marrow is required to document all 
response categories including progression. However, a second confirmatory bone marrow is not required to confirm response in any case 
• Radiographic studies are not required to satisfy th ese response requirements; however, if radiographic 
studies were performed there should be no ev idence of progressive or new bone lesions. 
Measurable Disease  
o Serum M-protein ≥0.5 g/dL  
o Urine M-protein ≥  200 mg/24 h 
o Serum FLC assay: Involved FLC level ≥10 mg/dL provided serum FLC ratio is abnormal 
 
The serum free light chain (sFLC) assay is of particular use in monitoring response to therapy in subjects 
who have oligo-secretory or non-secretory disease and should be used in assessing response only if the 
baseline serum and/or urine M proteins are not “mea surable” as above, and the baseline level of the 
involved FLC is “measurable.” When using this assay, it is important to note that the sFLC levels vary 
considerably with changes in renal function and in subj ects with renal insufficiency, the levels of both the  
kappa and lambda may remain elevated, but the ratio normalizes with achievement of CR. Thus, both the level of the involved and the uninvolved sFLC isotype (ie, the involved/uninvolved ratio or 
involved-uninvolved difference) should be considered in assessing response. Subjects included on the 
study on the basis of sFLC alone (ie, no measurable serum/urine m-spike) should be the only ones who are evaluated using sFLC response criteria. The others should follow usual criteria and ignore sFLC 
results with the exception of defining stringent complete response.

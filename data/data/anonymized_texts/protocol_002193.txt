PROTOCOL SUMMARY  
Study Title  An evaluation of Virtual Behavioral Health Integration  (VBHI)  into Primary Care  
Study 
Design  A pragmatic randomized  trial evaluating total cost of care  
Study 
Objectives  The primary objective is to evaluate the effectiveness of the virtual behavioral health 
integration (VBHI) program compared to usual care, on reducing the total cost of 
care reimbursed from Medicare and value -based contracts within 90 days of a 
patient’s p rimary care visit.  
 
Secondary objectives  of the evaluation include:  
• Compare  demographics , Charlson comorbidity index , and  social 
determinants of health among patients (hunger vital signs, home, education, 
employment, social and emotional health) between the two arms of the study  
• Compare the 90-day acute care utilization rate  after the index primary care 
visits  
• Compare  the 90 -day primary care utilization rate after the index primary care 
visit 
• Compare  the pharmacy related 90-day total cost of care after the index 
primary care visit  
• Stratify and report objectives by index primary care visit diagnoses 
(substance use disorder, depression/dysthymia, anxiety ) 
Exploratory  analys es among patients who enrolled in the VBHI program . A 
subgroup  of patients whose index primary care visit is within 9 months of the study 
start. Assessment at 3, 6, 9, and 12-month s 
• Symptom improvement  
o Depression: 50% reduction of PHQ -9 score from initial assessment  
o Depression  Remission : Percent of PHQ -9 score s <5 (for 2 
consecutive months  upon graduation ) 
o Suicidal ideation:  Percent of PHQ -9, Question #9=0 or C -SSRS 
negative upon graduation  
o Anxiety : GAD -7, 50% reduction from initial assessment  
• Health Outcomes  
o Reduction in BMI among patients with an initial BMI ≥ 25.0  
o Reduction in  HbA1c  among diabetic patients with an initial A1c ≥ 9  
o Reduction in LDL cholesterol level among patients with an initial 
LDL ≥ 160  
Inclusion  
Criteria  Inclusion  criteria : 
• 18 years of age or older  
• Primary care office visit  at a selected site  based on preventative and 
outpatient CPT codes  
• Have a PHQ -9 and an  overall score  >10 or Question 9 >0 
Version Number: 1. 4 
Version Date: 07 -25-19 
  
4 • Medicare or value -based contract  associated with a patient  in the past year  at 
the time of the primary care  visit 
Exclusion criteria:  
• A patient will contribute to the analysis once using their initial enrollment to 
either arm of the study  
• No insurance claim for the index primary care visit in the data warehouse  
upon evaluation  
Study 
Procedures  Patients who present to participating primary care practices  with a n elevated patient 
health questionn aire ( PHQ -9) score or report suicide ideation ( Question 9) will be 
treated and followed per the proposed virtual behavioral health integration (VBHI ) 
program  or usual care. As part of the current care process , all patients with a primary 
care visit are given  the PHQ -2 survey . A score ≥2  triggers the PHQ -9 survey . 
 
Of the primary care practices eligible for the VBHI program, half will be  randomly 
assigned  to either the control or intervention arm.  Each day a list of patients with an 
elevated PHQ -9 score from the prior day is generated along with the associated 
insurance plan for the patient.  All patients who meet eligibility criteria at sites where 
the VBHI program is offered will be considered exp osed to the intervention; 
whereas, patients seen at sites not utilizing the VBHI  program will be considered 
exposed to usual care. Patients who are in the intervention arm will be treated by the 
behavioral health care team  (licensed clinicians , health  coaches, a psychiatric 
pharmacist and psychiatric providers ). Virtual visits are conducted either by video 
assessment or telephonically. For the primary and secondary objectives , patients will 
be followed  for up to 90  days after their primary care  visit. For the exploratory  
analysis, patient with a primary care visit within 9 months of the study start date will 
be followed for up to 12 months  after their primary care visit . 
 
The VBHI  program  is defined by several key components :  
 
• Introduction to the patient follow -up process  
• Psychosocial assessment  
• Track ( Residential Mo vement, Nutrition, Sleep Hygiene, Stress Management, 
Pain Management, Perinatal/Postpartum Mood Disorders, Substance Abuse)  
and provid e treatment recommendations  
• Tracking of behavioral health symptoms (Depression, Anxiety, and Suicidal 
ideation) and provide treatment recommendations  
• Placement into an appropriate case management program, if needed  
• Navigation to additional psychiatric or substance use services, if needed  
• Motivational inte rviewing and brief therapeutic recommendations, if needed

8 OBJECTIVES  
1.1. Hypothesis  
 
Depressed p atients  who visit a primary care practice that offers a virtual behavioral health integration  
(VBHI)  program  will have lower  90-day total cost s of care compared to patients receiving primary care 
at practices without VBHI . 
1.2. Primary  Objective  
 
Compare the effectiveness of the VBHI program compared to usual care, on  modifying  the total cost of 
care reimbursed by Medicare and value -based contracts within 90 days of a patient’s index office visit . 
1.3. Secondary Objectiv es 
 
For the primary and secondary objectives, patients will be followed up to 90 days.  
 
• Compare  demographics , Charlson comorbidity index , and  social determinants of health among 
patients (hunger vital signs, home, education, employment, social and emotional health) between 
the two arms of the study  
• Compare the patient -centric 90 -day utilization rate after the index primary care visit  
• Compare  the 90-day primary care utilization rate after the index primary care visit  
• Compare the pharmacy related 90-day total cost of care after the index primary care visit  
• Stratify and report outcomes  by index primary care visit diagnoses (substance use disorder, 
depression/dysthymia,  anxiety ) 
 
1.4. Exploratory  Analyses  
 
For the exploratory analysis, patients who enrolled in the VBHI program in the first 9 months from 
study start will have their symptoms (depression score reduction, depression remission, suicidal 
ideation score reduction, anxiety score reduction) and health outcomes (BMI, LDL, and HbA1c) 
assessed at 3, 6, 9, and 12 -months.  
 
• Symptom improvement  
o Depression: Percent of patients with a 50% reduction of PHQ -9 score from initial 
assessment  
o Depression  Remission : Percent of patients with a PHQ -9 score <5 (for 2 consecutive 
months upon graduation)  
o Suicidal ideation: Percent of patients with a PHQ -9, Question #9=0 or C-SSRS negative 
upon graduation   
o Anxiety: Percent of patients with a  50% reduction of GAD -7 score among patients  with 
an initial score of > 10 
• Health Outcomes  
o Reduction in BMI among patients with an initial BMI ≥ 25.0  
o Reduction in HbA1c  among diabetic patients with an initial A1c ≥ 9  
o Reduction in LDL cholesterol level among patients with an initial LDL ≥ 160

9 2. BACKGROUND  
Mental illness is highly prevalent among adults  with reports as high as 20%  and a common reason for visits 
to primary care .1 Affective disorders like depression and anxiety generate significant healthcare costs and 
result in  social and vocational disability. Almost half of patients who are treated for major and minor 
depression ar e seen exclusively in primary care, with another 20% to 30% treated in both specialty and 
primary care settings.2-4 
Mental health treatment among primary care practices is typically delivered through short episodes of 
care.5 Primary care providers tend to offer less intensive mental health treatment than that provided by 
psychiatrists.6 The level of involvement of primary care providers to deliver outpatient mental health care 
often depends on : (1) lack of mental health providers in the region ;7 (2) willingness to prescribe 
psychotropic medications ;5 and (3) knowledge of mental health disorders.8 Clinical implications of a men tal 
illness comorbidity include increased risk of suicide, psychiatric hospitalization, increased disability, 
decreased compliance with treatment of medical illness, and markedly increased utilization of medical 
services.1 If untreated , depression and anxiety disorders can contribute to high medical utilization. It has 
been reported that 24% percent of the top 10% (high) healthcare utilizers have a diagnosis of current major 
depression and 22%, from an anxiety disorder.1  
Mental health providers have increasingly targeted their efforts on delivering virtual psychiatric 
consultation in the primary care setting.1 Use of virtual care programs provid ing mental health se rvices  is 
on the rise , often in rural and underserved areas where access to mental health services is not present or 
limited.9 Telepsychiatry efforts are often also implemented to improve rural providers’ capacity for 
managing patients with mental health illnesses.10 Outpatient psychiatric consultation programs have utilized 
clinicians to conduct telephone consultations as an efficient means to provide consultative, supplemental, 
and follow -up care.11 Evidence has shown that telepsychiatric evaluation services can be economical and 
with levels of quality and patient satisfaction similar to those found with face -to-face evaluations.12 Few 
programs, however, have reported on efforts to integrate these multiple services into a comprehensive 
“virtual mental health clinic” that can bot h provide a wide range of clinical services and support providers 
by means of educational offerings.  No studies to date have  shown through a rigorous evaluation the effect 
of virtual behavioral health integration on total cost of care that include value -based contracts.  The 
proposed virtual behavioral health integration (VBHI) program into the primary care setting is a structured 
mental illness treatment program that includes both behavioral treatment and counseling components aimed 
at reducing cost of care , developing and sustaining adaptive coping strategies, and improving short term 
acute care utilization.  
 
3. RATIONALE  
To enhance the care of patients seen in the primary care setting , Atrium Health  has designed a  virtual 
behavioral health integration program . A behavioral health care team comprised of licensed clinicians 
(Behavioral Health Professionals) , health coaches , a consulting  psychiatric pharmacist and psychiatric 
providers  follow patients for up to 3 months or more depending on pat ient need after their primary care 
office visit. This virtual behavioral health integration (VBHI) program is currently available in 36 Atrium 
Health primary care practices  providing support to over 200 providers and medical residents . The 
Behavioral healt h Service line is expanding the program to  additional primary care practices. Atrium

Version Date: 07 -25-19 
  
10 Health and the Carolinas Physician Alliance is interested in evaluating the effectiveness of the program on 
reducing the total cost of care.  
 
Patients may be referred to the VBHI program if they are identified as depressed after administration of the 
depression screening  tool (PHQ -9) or for other concerns by their primary care provider. The primary care 
provider can request assistance by a real -time in office video assessment or by a telephonic out of office 
assessment. Patients referred by a provider for ‘other concern’ instead of depression are not included in the 
evaluation.  
 
For this study, patients who have an elevated PHQ -9 score or report suicidal/homicidal ideation are eligible 
for analyses and  be identified from a behavioral health patient report. Patients meetin g eligibility criteria  
will accrue in both the intervention and usual care arms of the study. At intervention sites, t he VBHI 
program team will reach out to patients utilizing video assessment or telephonic outreach. Patient enrolled  
in the VBHI program wi ll receive the following core components:  Introduction to the patient follow -up 
process, psychosocial assessment, tracking  and treatment recommendations for  (residential movement, 
nutrition, sleep hygiene, stress management, pain management, perinatal/ postpartum mood disorders, 
substance abuse) , tracking and treatment recommendations for behavioral health symptoms ( depression, 
anxiety, suicidal ideation , etc. ), placement into an appropriate case management program if needed , 
navigation to additional psychiatric or substance use services if needed , and m otivational interviewing and 
brief therapeutic recommendations if needed . 
 
There may be cases where patients are eligible to enroll in full case management programs based on their 
insurance a nd other  criteria  –in these situations the VHBI team will coordinate a seamless care 
transition . For example, if a patient has Medicaid through Cardinal Innovations , a managed care 
organization providing local behavioral health care,  and meets certain criteria, the patient would  no longer 
require services  from VHBI team as they would be duplicative .  
 
For the primary  and secondary objectives, a  patient ’s contact  with the VBHI program  ends after 90 days 
following the primary care office visit , or if there is a failure to contact,  or becomes  enrolled with a case -
management program  which provides behavioral health services , or declines services, or dies . The 
behavioral health care team  will ensure the patient is enrolled in a case management program thr ough 
contact with staff before ending contact with the patient.  
 
This research project  is a parallel group, cluster randomized quality improvement evaluation  which seeks to 
evaluate the total cost of care  among patients in the VB HI program for up to 90 day s after their primary 
care visit.  The outcomes evaluation of this quality improvement intervention has been designed to integrate 
into the routine care and minimize frontline staff burden by deploying an evaluation in a real -world setting.

11 4. SUBJECT AND SITE SEL ECTION  
4.1. Accrual  – Primary Care Practices  
 
Randomization will occur at the practice level with the primary care practices being identified as an 
intervention or usual care site for the duration of the study. Out of 20 primary care clinics that have 
shown interest in the VBHI program, 10 will be rand omized into the intervention arm and 10 into the 
usual care arm. Not all sites in the intervention arm are starting the program immediately. There will be 
a scheduled rollout of 2 -3 clinics per month. As intervention sites come on board, a corresponding 
control site will begin contributing to the evaluable population.  Twelve  practices indicated  their 
readiness to incorporate the VBHI program into patient care  in 2019 with the remaining indicati ng 
2020. A practice labeled as low volume had historically averaged 15 or less eligible patients per month.  
A practice labeled as high volume had historical averaged 16 or more eligible patients per month.  
 
Twelve practices were identified by the behavioral health team for a 2019 rollout  based on the 
readiness to engage with the VBHI  program  in 2019 . Practices were clustered by patient volume per 
month  (low n=8, high n=4). The 8 practices with lower  volumes were randomly ordered and assigned 
as either a case or control  (1:1) . The 4 practices with higher  volumes were randomly ordered and 
assigned as either a case or control (1:1).  The six primary care practices and corresponding matched 
control practice  were then randomly ordered for a 2019 rollout. Each month that a practice  starts using 
the VBHI program, patients start accruing from the randomly matched  control practice.  
 
Eight practices were identified by the behavioral health team for a 2020 rollout based on the readiness 
to engage with the VBHI program in 2020 . These practices were not ready to engage in 2019 . Practices 
were clustered by patient volume per month (low n=4, high n=4). The 4 practices with lower volumes 
were randomly ordered and assigned as either a case or control (1:1). The 4 practices with higher 
volumes were randomly ordered and assigned as either a case or control (1:1). The four primary care 
practices and corresponding matched control practice were then randomly ordered for a 20 20 rollout. 
Each month that a practice starts using the VBHI prog ram, patients start accruing from the randomly 
matched control practice.  
 
4.2. Accrual  – Subjects  
 
Patients 18 years of age or older  at primary care practices with a PHQ -9 overall score >10 or Question 
9 >0, and with Medicare or other value -based contract where  the VBHI program is offered will be 
considered exposed to the intervention; whereas, patients seen at sites not utilizing the VBHI program 
will be considered exposed to usual care. Patients who are in the interv ention arm will be treated by the 
behavioral health care team (licensed clinicians , health coaches , a psychiatric pharmacist and 
psychiatric providers ). Virtual visits are conducted either by video assessment or telephonically.  As part 
of the current care process, all patients with a primary care visit are given the PHQ -2 survey. A score 
≥2 triggers the PHQ -9 survey.  Patients who present to participating primary care practices with an 
elevated patient health questionnaire (PHQ -9) score or report suicide ide ation (Question 9) will be 
Version Number: 1. 4 
Version Date: 07 -25-19 
  
12 treated and followed per the proposed virtual behavioral health integration (VBHI) program or usual 
care. Each week day a list of patients is received by the  behavioral health care team. The list includes 
patients with an elevated PHQ -9 score from the prior day and the associated insurance plan for the 
patien t. The insurance plan is included so that the behavioral health team can target patients with 
Medicare  
 or other value -based  contracts that report total costs back to Atrium Health. On Mondays, the team 
receives a list of patients seen between Friday and Sunday.  
 
Patients included in the analysis of this  study  must  meet the inclusion \exclusion criteria  and have a n 
insurance  claim for the index primary care visit when they became eligible  in the  enterprise data 
warehouse (EDW) . Patients will begin accruing based on the time the practice goes live according to 
the role out schedule and will continue for 17 months. The VBHI program  is available to any patients in 
the practice  but the evaluation is centered on the cohort of patients meeting the inclusion criteria . 
 
4.3. Inclusion \Exclusion Criteria  
4.3.1.  Inclusion Criteria  
Eligible patients in the analyses must meet each of the following criteria:  
• 18 years of age or older  
• Primary care office visit at a selected site  based on preventative and outpatient CPT codes  
• Have a PHQ -9 and an overall score >10 or Question 9 >0  
• Medicare or value -based contract  associated with a patient  in the past year  
4.3.2.  Exclusion Criteria  
• A patient will contribute to the analysis once using their initial enrollment to either arm 
of the study  
• No insurance claim for the index primary care visit  in the data wa rehouse  upon 
evaluation  
4.4. Evaluable P opulation  
Patients included in the evaluable population for this project, will have their data inform the final 
outcomes assessment.  All patients who meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria  in both arms will be 
assessed  for the primary outcome  (intent to treat  and by per protocol ).

5.2. Virtual Behavioral Health Integration  
The flow of patients from initial contact  to their follow -up calls  is outlined in Appendix 1.  In the 
existing VBHI  primary care  workflow , all patients are given the PHQ -2 survey. A score ≥2 triggers the 
PHQ -9 survey . The following day the behavioral health team receives a patient report. The report  
Version Number: 1. 4 
Version Date: 07 -25-19 
  
15 includes patien ts seen the prior day  at intervention sites that had an elevated PHQ -9 score  >10 or 
report ed suicide ideation (Question 9  >0). The Monday report includes patients seen Friday -Sunday.  
Patients associated with  Medicare or other value -based insurance plan are identified in the report . The 
behavioral health care team will reach out to these patients for enrollment utilizing video assessment or 
telephon ic outreach.  The patient always  has the option not to be followed by the behavioral health care 
team .  
 
The behavioral health care team  will complete the initial behavioral health assessment. The initial 
health assessment contains information such as preferred communication method, GAD -7, psychiatry 
provider, collateral resources, recent ED and hospital utilization, substance use disorder , medication 
barriers, appointment barriers, community resources, and crisis planning.  
 
The frequency of f ollow -up assessments depends on the clinical presentation and medication 
recommendation and/or adherence . The assessment inc ludes information such as a suicide ideation 
safety screening, an appointment reminder, appointment barrier evaluations, medication reconciliation, 
medication obtainment follow -up, substance use disorder follow -up, supportive listening, 
psychoeducation, co mmunity resource follow -up, and additional crisis planning.  
 
The Columbia -Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C -SSRS) helps identify whether someone is at risk for 
suicide, and the severity and immediacy of the risk. It also identifies level of support the pers on needs. 
The screening tool is administered during each phone contact to measure suicide ideation . Follow -up 
patients enrolled in the VBHI program will receive follow -up phone call s. The frequency of calls is 
depend ent on the clinical presentation and medication recommendation and/or adherence . A follow -up 
assessment is completed upon each phone call.  
 
5.3. Usual Care  
All patients are given the PHQ -2 survey  during the primary care visit . A score ≥  2 triggers the PHQ -9 
survey . The PHQ -9 offers providers a concise, self -administrated screening and diagnostic tool for 
Major Depressive Disorder  (Table 1) . Treatment can be based on the patients total PHQ -9 score. The 
patient’s provider in the primary care practice has the option to refer  the patient to community base d 
behavioral health services, begin medication management within the primary care setting, or encourage 
the patient to obtain a psychiatric evaluation at the nearest emergenc y department to assess safety 
concern s including both suicidal and homicidal ideation.  For patients that have a diagnosis of 
depression or dysthymia, the PHQ -9 is administered every 4 months. There are no follow -up behavioral 
health services based on the P HQ-9 score once the patient leaves the primary care practice.

6.1. Power Analysis  
We are working with our data management group to develop the 90 -day total cost of care measure. 
With this version of the protocol we can only estimate  cost savings. In the literature,  studies on 
behavioral health integration tend to evaluate symptom improvement or utilization. Blue Cross Blue 
Shield of Kansas City data were used to conduct a case control program evaluation  in 2018 . This study 
assessed the cost effectiveness of embeddin g a Behavioral Health Clinician into an Existing Primary 
Care Practice. Though not virtual, we would assume a similar direction in cost saving reduction in our 
program. The results demonstrated that integrating behavioral health services into the practice was 
associated with $860.16 per member per year savings or 10.8% savings in costs .13 
 
6.2. Statistical analysis  
Prior to analysis, descriptive statistics will be calculated to screen all variables for accuracy and to 
examine distributions.   
 
All analyses will follow the intention -to-treat (“ITT”) principle,  such that patients will be analyzed 
based on the assignmen t of their primary care site to the VBHI program or usual care.   Balance in 
baseline characteristics between the groups will be assessed using Student’s t -test for normally 
distributed data, the Wilcoxon rank sum test for ordinal data or interval data that  are not normally 
distributed, and the chi -square test for categorical data. Normality will be assessed using the Shapiro 
Wilk test and Q -Q plots.  
 
The primary outcome, total cost of care, will be compared between the VBHI and usual care groups 
using a li near mixed -effects model with a random effect to account for within -practice correlation. The 
primary predictor in the model is an indicator for assignment to the VBHI program versus usual care. 
Additional baseline covariates will be included in the model if they are either strongly correlated with 
the dependent variable or show baseline imbalance between the two groups.  
Version Number: 1. 4 
Version Date: 07 -25-19 
  
18  
The secondary outcome of pharmacy -related total cost of care will be compared between treatment 
groups using the same approach as for the  primary outcome. A similar approach will be used to 
compare 90 -day patient -centric, primary care, and avoidable care utilization rates, except the models 
will be generalized linear mixed models with a logit link, where utilization (yes/no) is the binary 
dependent variable.  
 
Sub-analyses of the primary and secondary outcomes using the above methods will be performed on the 
data stratified by index primary care visit diagnosis.  
 
In addition, per -protocol analyses of the primary and secondary outcomes will be  performed to evaluate 
the effect of VBHI program participation, in contrast to the ITT analysis evaluating the effectiveness of 
referral to the program. The per -protocol analyses will include only subjects who received and adhered 
to the treatment (VBHI p rogram or usual care) assigned to their clinic. The analyses will be similar to 
those described above for ITT, except the primary predictor is an indicator for treatment (VBHI 
program or usual care) received rather than treatment assigned. To help address confounding due to 
incomplete adherence, the per -protocol analyses will adjust for pre -randomization and post -
randomization factors that predict adherence. To identify such factors, a separate, multivariable logistic 
regression analysis will be performed o n the full dataset with adherence (yes/no) as the dependent 
variable.  
 
Exploratory analyses will evaluate baseline to 3 -, 6-, 9-, and 12 -month changes in symptom 
improvement and health outcomes using generalized linear mixed models with a logit link, where  the 
dependent variable is binary (e.g., 50% reduction of PHQ -9 score from initial assessment (yes/no)). 
Random effect terms in the model will account for within -practice clustering and within -patient 
correlation. Fixed effects will be the treatment group indicator, time indicator, and interaction between 
treatment group and time.  
 
All tests will be two -sided and the data will be analyzed using SAS Enterprise Guide 7.1 (SAS Institute 
Inc., Cary, NC, USA).  
  
6.3. Data Collection Dates  
The implementation of the VBHI program  will begin in August 2019.

10. SAFETY RISK S AND REPORTING  
The data collection  and intervention for  this project presents no more than minimal risk to patients.  The 
VBHI program is currently offered at 36 primary care clinics  within Atrium Health . This study is 
evaluat ing the VBHI program among additional clinics  that will  offer the program to their patients.  
However, patients who present  to the primary care setting  with a behavioral health crisis are considered a 
high-risk population. The implementation  of the VBHI program and its components  complement  ongoing 
patient care through virtual patient navigation  within Atrium Health . The addit ion of an evaluation design 
that align s with existing patient care expansion  thus confers minimal  additional risk to patients.  
Version Number: 1. 4 
Version Date: 07 -25-19 
  
21 Other potential risks of participation in this project include, the risk of health information disclosure. There 
is always the risk of disclosure of a patient’s private health information  (PHI) or medical information. 
However, the processes identified in t his protocol to enable the execution of this project,  do not increase 
inherent risk of disclosure. Atrium Health  utilizes several  hard and soft safety controls in the protection of 
patient information and medical records. Security controls include, but are  not limited to, multiple system 
firewalls, access restrictions to patient records and information, locked offices and bui ldings housing 
research and  patient data, and multiple layers of username and password protected computer and system 
access.  Statistic al tools and programs that are developed are stored on secure restricted access file shares.  
Programs have versioning controls turned on and access to the file shares are restricted.  Access is granted 
through a request process that requires multiple auth orizations and is controlled centrally by our 
Information and Analytics Service Department .  
The CORE  project team will ensure that appropriate handling of patient PHI follows standard Atrium 
Health  procedure. Confidentiality will be maintained according t o ICH E6; 4.8.10, part 0: “Records 
identifying the subject will be kept confidential and, to the extent permitted by the applicable laws and/or 
regulations, will not be made publicly available. If the results of the study trial are published, the patient’s 
identity will rem ain confidential.’ In the event of PHI disclosure, the appropriate internal departments will 
be informed and processed per legislation and privacy regulations.  
 
10.1. Data Quality Assurance  
 
This study will be organized, performed, and reported in compliance with the study protocol, 
standard operating procedures (SOPs) of the CORE  and Atrium Health , and other applicable 
regulations and guidelines (e.g. GCP).  
 
10.2. Safety Reporting to the IRB  
 
All events occurring during the conduct of a protocol and meeting the definition of a  reportable 
safety event per the IRB guidelines, will be reported to the IRB within  10 working days of the 
Investigator  learning of the event , per their requirements . 
 
Major p rotocol deviations that result in a threat to subject safety or the integrity of the study will be 
reported to t he IRB per their requirements.  
 
10.3. Data  Monitoring by the Sponsor  
The conduct of this project will abide by standard operating procedures set forth  by both Atrium 
Health  and CORE . The Principal Investigator s, statistician, and other team members will meet as 
needed to review  enrollment and retention, study progress , and validity/integrity of the data. 
Documentation of these meetings will be kept with  study records.

22 11. RESEARCH COMPLETION  
The Principal Investigator s have the right to close the project  at any site at any time.  
For any closure, the following applies:  
• Closure should occur only after consultation between involved parties.  
• In case of a partial study or site closure, patients still participating in the VBHI program , or those 
who are considered in follow -up, must be taken care of in an ethical manner.  
 
The study will be considered complete when one or more of the following con ditions is met:  
• The enrollment period has ended, and the data collection period is complete . 
• All subjects have dropped out or discontinued from the study  after the enrollment period is 
completed, but prior to data collection cutoff  as described in section 8.3. 
• The IRB  or Principal Investigator discontinues the study.  
• The Principal Investigator defines an administrative or clinical cut -off date.  
Upon study completion, a final report will be presented to the Executive Committee and all key 
stakeholders. The final report will detail all findings including primary, secon dary and post-hoc outcomes. 
The team will also prepare a manuscript for publication focused on outcomes and feasibility of 
implementation of the VBHI program .

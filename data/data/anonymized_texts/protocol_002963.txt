   BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE  
Spasmodic Dysphonia (SD)  
Spasmodic dysphonia (SD) is a task -specific focal laryngeal dystonia characterized by irregular and 
uncontrolled voice breaks that interrupt normal speech flow.1 The condition was first described by Critchley in 
1939 and was for some time considered a psychiatric disorder.2 The estimated prevalence in western society is 
between 1 in 50,000 and 1 in 100,000.3,4 There are likely multiple neurological processes involved in the 
pathophysiology of SD: reduced cortical inhibition, sensory -processing and reflex disturbances, and 
neuroanatomical findings at several different levels. Thus, SD should be considered an integrative system 
disorder, rather than a disorder with a single pathological focus.1 Its etiology is multifactorial, including 
neurological, genetic, and environmental factors. Epidemiological risk factors have been suggested from several 
large cohort studies. The most commonly identified characteristics are females in their middle decades of life, a 
family history of neurological diseases including dystonia, recent life stressors, upper respiratory tract 
infections, and a history of childhood measles or mumps.1 The eventual development of SD may be viewed as a 
multiple -hit mechanism, with endogenous predispositions and environmental triggers resulting in the 
development of its phenotype. Adductor spasmodic dysphonia (AdSD), characterized by a harsh, strain -
strangled voice with breaks on vowels in speech, is the most common variant of the condition.5 Vocal tremor 
co-occurs in 30% to 60% of AdSD patients.1,5 
A three -tiered approach, involving clinical history, followed by speech assessment and in -office laryngoscopy is 
the most widely accepted method for making the diagnosis of SD.5 Diagnosis is often made years after 
symptom onset and following assessment by numerous physicians.6 In clinical practice, a history of speech 
therapy failing to ameliorate symptoms and positive treatment response to botulinum neurotoxin  is a reliable 
adjunct to diagnosis. Botox (onabotulinumtoxinA) is the most frequently used and studied formulation of 
botulinum neurotoxin.  
Based on the significant symptom response of blepharospasm to intermittent injections of Botox, Blitzer et al. 
performed the first laryngeal injection of Botox for SD in 1984.7,8 Botulinum neurotoxin  is internalized at the 
nerve terminal and works by cleaving proteins in the SNARE (soluble n -ethylmaleimide -sensitive factor [NSF] 
attachment protein receptor) complex, which facilitate the binding of vesicles containing acetylcholine to the 
nerve terminal.9,10 Botulinum neurotoxin  cleaves SNAP -25 inhibiting presynaptic acetylcholine release and 
muscle activity.9 The precise mechanism by which botulinum neurotoxin  improves SD symptomatology is 
unknown. Its effect is not fully explained by chemodenervation of the thyroarytenoid muscle since other 
adductor muscles are relatively unaffected and some patients experience improvement in concurrent 
extralaryngeal dystonias.9 It may therefore result in disease modulation at a central level.11  
Despite its use in the larynx being considered “off -label” by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), 
botulinum neurotoxin  has remained the first -line treatment for spasmodic dysphonia.12 botulinum neurotoxin  is 
the recommended primary management strategy in the American Academy of Otolaryngology -Head and Neck 
Surgery’s Clinical Practice Guideline for dysphonia.13 Alternative treatment options for SD include surgical 
treatments, which include thyroarytenoid myotomy/myectomy, thyroplasty, selective laryngeal adductor 
denervation -reinnervation, laryngeal nerve crush, and recurrent laryngeal nerve resection.14 There are no 
published randomized controlled trials comparing the effect of Botox injections and surgical treatment.14 A 
systematic review published in 2017 reported that preference for one treatment could not be demonstrated.14 
The effect of bilateral Botox injections was evaluated and the authors found an improvement in the objective 
outcome, subjective outcome, and quality of life. The mean duration of effect ranged between 14 and 18 weeks. 
There is currently no cure for the condition. Thalamic deep brain stimulation may become a future treatment 
option to interfere with the central pathophysiology of SD.15

 Laryngeal Injections  
In-office procedures are increasingly common in laryngology.16 Their  success is dependent on adequate 
analgesia, and while these procedures are generally considered to be well -tolerated, few studies address pain or 
patient experience. A systematic review published in 2019 analyzed the literature for studies reporting 
qualitative or quantitative data for periprocedural pain assessment in adult patients undergoing in -office 
otolaryngology procedures.16 A total of 86 studies met inclusion criterial, of which 31 related to laryngology. Of 
the 86 studies, only 13 were prospective studies comparing interventions and none of these studies addressed 
analgesia in laryngeal injections.16 This study will be the first to compare the impact of anesthetic techniques in 
laryngeal injections.  
Vocal fold injections (VFI) are commonly performed in -office procedures in laryngology that can be used as a 
treatment modality in vocal fold paralysis and in a number of other laryngeal pathologies, in addition to 
enabling the injection of botulinum neurotoxin  in the treatment of SD. These can be performed transcutaneously 
(with multiple techniques), transnasally, or transorally. The transcricothyroid approach (a needle is passed 
through the skin, soft tissue, and cricothyroid membrane) is the most studied technique overall. Specific to the 
treatment of SD, a transcricothyroid approach is favored by 90% of laryngologists treating SD with botulinum 
neurotoxin.12 
The patient experience and pain associated with laryngeal injections have been previously studied.17,18,19 Young 
et al. reported the patient tolerance of 154 in -office laryngeal procedures including 108 VFIs, of which 8 were 
Botox injections.17 Transcutaneous VFI was performed following injection of subcutaneous local anesthetic. 
The rate of completion of the first -choice VFI approach was 93%. Average patient -reported pain on the VAS 
was approximately 40. There was no statistically significant difference in pain between percutaneous and per -
oral VFI approaches (VAS 43.1 versus 38.4). Discomfort score differed significantly between those patients 
who had a VFI successfully completed with the first -choice VFI technique versus those who required more than 
one VFI approach (36.03 versus 61.29).17 Birkent et al. enrolled 26 patients receiving VFI with a 
transcricothyroid approach under local anesthesia with a mean reported VAS of 44.18 Crawley et al. enrolled 45 
patients to study the perception and duration of pain after VFI.19 Injection was performed with a 
transcricothyroid approach following local and topical anesthesia. Almost 80% of patients reported increased 
pain from baseline to during the procedure and from baseline to after the procedure. The majority of patients 
reported that their pain persisted or worsened during the first post -procedure day. Almost half of patients took 
additional pain medication. A third of patients were still experiencing some discomfort on the third post -
procedure day. They found that the magnitude of the increase in pain during the procedure was significantly 
associated with the presence of pain on the third post -procedure day. This data supports the hypothesis that 
nociceptive sensitization is responsible for lingering pain. In this study, patients reported a significant increase 
in sickening and punishing sensations as well as exhaustion and fear during the procedure.19  
None of these studies controlled or compared anesthetic techniques. In each of the aforementioned studies, 
subcutaneous local anesthetic was delivered prior to transcutaneous injections. However, one -third of 
laryngologists report not using local anesthesia when treating SD with Botox.12 Nor were alternative anesthetic 
techniques utilized.

 Vibration Anesthesia  
Vibratory stimulation is defined as the performance of continuous, quick, slight shaking movements on the skin 
using devices or fingers.20 The application of a vibratory stimulus has been shown to improve patient 
discomfort associated with various needle -related procedures including botulinum neurotoxin  injections for 
cosmetic indications.21 The application of intense stimuli to the skin as a means of pain relief is not a novel 
concept.22 Countless generations of bruised knees have been taken to mother so that she could "rub it to make it 
better". Ancient Greeks used vigorous massage to deal with sporting injuries, and by the early renaissance, de 
Mandeville was able to include percussion as a recognized treatment for pain. Percussion analgesia for 
amputation stump pain was recognized in the aftermath of the American Civil War, but this approach was not 
reported until the mid -1940s.22  
 
In the 1960s a mechanism for the anesthetic capability of vibration was proposed. Melzack and Wall’s “gate 
control” theory of pain postulates that the intensity of pain can be reduced by concurrent non -noxious 
stimulation, such as vibration.23 Their hypothesis states that the transmission of the sense of vibration from 
mechanoreceptors located in the skin via A -β nerve fibers results in the shutting down of a “gate” through 
which pain signals are transmitted to the brain through A -δ and C fibers.23 Despite this physiologic concept 
being well -recognized, in addition to much empirical evidence existing to support its validity, prospective 
controlled trials assessing its utility during awake procedures have only recently been produced.  
 
A number of studies exist in the facial plastic surgery literature analyzing the analgesic properties of vibratory 
stimulation while performing cosmetic injections.21,24 -26 Sharma et al. applied a vibratory stimulus during the 
cosmetic facial injection of Botox.21 There was a statistically significant reduction in patient’s pain scores (1.3 
vs 2.4 on a five -point Likert -type scale). Of the 50 patients, 82% noted that the vibration side of the face had 
lower pain than the side of their face injected without vibration. Further, 86% these patients preferred to utilize 
vibratory analgesia for subsequent injections.21 Mally et al. applied a vibratory stimulus during injection of the 
nasolabial folds with dermal filler.24 They found improved patient tolerance with vibratory stimulation. While 
88% of patients found the injections moderate to severely painful without vibration, only 14% with vibration 
experienced moderate to severe pain.24 This finding was replicated by Guney et al. in a randomized split -lip 
study assessing vibration anesthesia during lip augmentation with cosmetic filler.25 The overall pain score on 
the vibration -assisted side was significantly reduced (3.8 vs 5.6 on a ten -point Likert -type scale). Of the 25 
patients enrolled in this study, 23 stated that they would want to have vibration anesthesia for future injections. 
The 2 patients who declined vibration stimuli for the future stated that they felt an increase of pain and anxiety 
with the addition of vibration. Both of these patients underwent lip augmentation for the first time. All patients 
that had undergone previous lip augmentation treatments expressed a desire for vibration anesthesia in the 
future.25 Chorney et al. published a prospective, randomized, self -control trial of cosmetic botulinum toxin 
injections comparing vibration anesthesia to topical ice analgesia to no additional analgesia.26 There were 30 
injections given with vibration analgesia, with a mean VAS of 26.5. There were 28 injections given with ice 
that resulted in a mean VAS of 24.4. Among the 30 injections given without any analgesia, patients had mean 
VAS of 29.4. There was no statistically significant difference between these groups. Of note this study design 
resulted in a lack of power given only a maximum of 30 injections were present in each arm.  
 
There is additional support for the analgesic properties of vibratory stimulation outside of the facial plastic 
surgery literature. A systematic review evaluated evidence of the effectiveness of vibratory stimulation to 
reduce needle -related procedural pain in children.20 The meta -analysis of this systematic review showed  
Minimal Risk Protocol Template [IRB 10429.0 10]  Effective: 9/20/2017  
 
       Page 5 of 10 
 that vibratory stimulation was significantly effective according to both self -rated and observer -rated pain 
measurements regardless of age group, type of procedure, or type of vibration device.20 Within the dermatology 
literature further support can be found. Park et al. studied VAS scores when vibration anesthesia  
was used during keloid triamcinolone injections. Intralesional injection therapy without vibration  
yielded mean VAS scores of 59 compared to 33 when vibration was used (P < .05).27 Fix et al. studied vibration 
anesthesia during the injection of lidocaine in an open label, randomized, controlled, split -body  
trial. The median VAS pain score was 26 for injections without vibration versus 7.5 with vibration (P<0.01).28 
 
However, no study to date has analyzed the use of vibration analgesia during VFI.

Data Analysis  
 
 
Power analyses may not be appropriate if this is a feasibility or pilot study, but end -point analysis plans are 
always appropriate even if only exploratory. Provide all information requested below, or provide justification if 
not including all of the information.  
 
Power Statement :   
Sample size estimation is estimated based on the repeated methodology; that is, the VAS score will be measured 
at three time points (initial visit, 3 months and 6 months) for each patient. The comparisons between treatment 
arms (treatment B and C) and control arm (A) are of interest. To preserve the family wise type I error rate, 0.05, 
Bonferroni approach is used to adjust the pairwise type I error (0.05/2 = 0.025). We further assume the standard 
deviation across subjects at the same time point is 3.00, and there is a weak correlation between the VAS (<= 
0.3) within each patient. To achieve 80% to detect statistically significant differences in the mean VAS between 
A and B, and between A and C, the required sample size based on different value of correlation are listed 
below:

Note: The weaker the correlation and the smaller the mean difference in VAS the larger the sample size.  
Randomization schedule will be generated by the study statistician.  Randomization will determine the order 
they get these treatments and can follow any permutation.  
 
Data Analysis Plan:  
Data Handling   
The study data will be entered and saved in REDCap. The REDCap database will be created by the 
study personnel. Only the PI and study personnel will have access to the database.  
Data analysis  
Data will be summarized by mean (standard deviation) or median (interquartile range) for 
continuous variables, and frequency count (percentage) for categorical variable. The number of 
patients without the VAS score at 3 - and 6 -months after the initial visit will be reported. Generalized 
estimating equation will be used to compare the mean VAS score between groups, and the point 
estimate of the mean difference and 95% confidence interval will be reported.  
 
Endpoints  
Primary: Response to the Visual Analogue Scale  
Secondary : Patient preference regarding injection analgesia

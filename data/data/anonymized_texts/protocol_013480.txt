Name of Investigational Product:  ALKS  3831  
Name of Active Ingredient:  Olanzapine and samidorphan  
Title of Study:  A Study to Evaluate the Effect of ALKS  3831 Compared to Olanzapine on Body Weight 
in Young Adults with Schizophrenia, Schizophreniform, or Bipolar I Disorder Who are Early in Their 
Illness  
Investigators:  This is a multinational multicenter study . 
Study Period:  
Estimated date of first subject’s consent: Q2 2017  
Estimated date of last subject’s last visit : Q4 2021  Phase of Development:  3 
 
Objectives:  
Primary:  
To evaluate the effect of ALKS  3831, compared to olanzapine, on body weight in young adults with 
schizophrenia, schizophreniform, or bipolar I disorder who are early in their illness 
Secondary:  
To evaluate the safety and tolerability of ALKS 3831 in young adults with schizophrenia, 
schizophreniform , or bipolar I disorder who are early in their illness 
Methodology:  This is a Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind study to evaluate the effect of 
ALKS  3831 compared to olanzapine on body weight in young adults with schizophrenia, 
schizophreniform disorder, or bipolar I disorder who are early in their illness.  
Subjects will be screened at Visit  1, up to 30 days prior to randomization. At Visit 2, eligible subjects will 
be randomized (1:1) to ALKS  3831 or olanzapine and receive study drug for up to 12 weeks. 
Randomization will be stratified by diagnosis (schizophrenia/schizophreniform disorder vs bipolar I 
disorder), region  (US vs non- US), and baseline BMI (<25 vs ≥25) . Subjects on antipsychotic medications 
or mood stabilizers (excluding study medication)  should be tapered off this medication by the end of 
Week 2 (Visit  4). Subjects may be inpatient or outpatient at S creening , however in the opinion of the 
Investigator , all subjects should be appropriate for eventual outpatient treatment. Subjects should be 
outpatient within 2  weeks post randomization. Cases that require inpatient treatment for longer than 
2 weeks will require review and approval by the Medical Monitor on a case by case basis.  
Starting with W eek 2 (Visit 4), subjects will come for biweekly visits for the remaining 10  weeks. Study 
drug will be provided to subjects as coated bilayer tablets dispensed in blister packs at each visit to be taken at home (one tablet by mouth each day, preferably at bedtime). The doses of olanzapine will 
be 5, 10, 15, or 20 mg and the doses of ALKS 3831 will be 5, 10, 15, or 20  mg olanzapine combined with 
10 mg samidorphan (henceforth will be r eferred to as 5/10, 10/10, 15/10, or  20/10 mg). For the first week 
at the discretion of the I nvestigator , subjects will receive 5  mg, 10 mg, 15 mg, or 20 mg of olanzapine 
or 5/10 mg, 10/10 mg, 15/10 mg , or 20/10 mg of ALKS  3831. At the end of Week 1, for subjects initiated 
on 5 mg of olanzapine or 5/10 mg of ALKS  3831, the dose will be increased to 10 mg of olanzapine or 
10/10 mg of ALKS  3831. For all other s ubjects, the dose may also be increased to either  15 or 20 mg of 
olanzapine or 15/10 or 20/10  mg of ALKS  3831. Following this increase, the dose may be increased or 
decreased to  5, 10, 15, or 20  mg of olanzapine, or to 5/10, 10/10, 15/10, or  20/10 mg of AL KS 3831 at the 
Investigator’s discretion. Dosing will be flexible throughout the study; however, frequent adjustments are 
  Alkermes, Inc . 
Protocol ALK3831-A307 Amendment 5.0 CONFIDENTIAL  
Page 4 of 69 discouraged. Dose adjustments can only be performed on -site at the study center. Subjects requiring dose 
adjustments between scheduled  visits should arrange an unscheduled visit.  
Body weight, body composition (measured by Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis [BIA]), and metabolic 
parameters (including fasting triglycerides, cholesterol and glucose) will be measured throughout the 
12-week treatment period. Psychiatric symptoms will be evaluated using the Clinical Global Impressions 
(CGI) scales. Additional assessments will include Impact of Weight on Quality of Life -Lite Questionnaire 
(IWQOL -Lite).  A daily medication adherence monitoring and reminder system (via smartphones ) may  be 
used in this study. In addition, subjects will be asked to participate in a supportive clinical care (S CC) 
program during the 12- week treatment period. Participation in the SCC program will be independent of 
study visits and based on clinician and subject preference. A schematic summarizing study design is 
presented below.  
 
Number of Subjects Planned:  Approximately 425 subjects will be randomized in order to have 400 
subjects in the efficacy population (200 per treatment group).  
Main Criteria for Inclusion:  For US sites, men and women ≥16 through <40 years of age at Screening. 
For non- US sites , men and women ≥18 through <40 years of age at S creening. Subjects will have a body -
mass index (BMI) of <30.0 kg/m2 at Screening and Visit  2, with a Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of 
Mental Disorders- Fifth Edition ( DSM -5) primary diagnosis of schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder, 
or bipolar I disorder and meet Sponsor criteria for previous antipsychotic treatmen t and duration of 
illness. Subjects with bipolar I disorder must have experienced  an acute episode of mania as defined by 
DSM -5 within the last 14 days prior to Visit 1 . 
Main Criteria for Exclusion:  Subjects may be excluded based on  diagnosis of additional psychiatric 
conditions, use of prohibited or contraindicated drugs and medications, pre-existing medical conditions, abnormal lab results during S creening, participation in any recent clinical trials or previous clinical trials 
of ALKS  3831 or samidorphan, pregnancy and relationship to an employee of the study Sponsor, CRO , 
Investigator , or study site . 
Investigational Product, Dosage, Durat ion, and Mode of Administration:  ALKS  3831 refers to the 
fixed  dose combination of olanzapine and samidorphan. ALKS 3831 will be supplied as a coated bilayer 
tablet containing 5, 10, 15, or 20 mg olanzapine and 10 mg samidorphan. The tablet will be taken by mouth once daily, preferably at bedtime, for up to 12 weeks.  
Reference Therapy , Dosage, Duration, and Mode of A dministration:  Olanzapine will be supplied as 
an identical bilayer tablet manufactured by Alkermes, Inc., containing 5, 10, 15, or 20  mg of olanzapine 
only and no additional active ingredients. Olanzapine tablets will be taken by mouth once daily, preferably at bedtime, for up to 12 weeks.  
Duration of Study:  The total study duration will be approximately 20 weeks including a 4 -week 
Screening P eriod, a 12- week T reatment P eriod , and a 4- week Follow-up Period. Subjects completing the 
treatment period  will be eligible to enroll in a long -term safety study ( ALK3831 -A308 ) where it is Screening 12-week Double Blind Treatment PeriodALKS 3831 5/10, 10/10, 15/10, 20/10 mg

Criter ia for Evaluation:  
Primary Endpoint:  
• Percent change from baseline in body weight at W eek 12 
Secondary Endpoints:  
• Proportion of subjects with ≥10% weight gain at Week 12 
• Proportion of subjects with ≥7% weight gain at Week 12 
• Change from baseline in waist circumference at Week 12  
• Change from baseline in Clinical Global Impression -Severity  (CGI -S) score within the ALKS 
3831 Group at Week 12 
Other En dpoints : 
• Absolute change from baseline in body weight by visit 
• Proportion of subjects with ≥5 cm increase in waist circumference from baseline at Week 12  
• Body composition endpoints, as assessed by bioimpedance analysis, including: 
− Change from baseline in fat mass by visit  
− Change from baseline in percent body fat by vi sit 
− Change from baseline in f at mass i ndex by visit  
− Change from baseline in visceral adipose tissue by visit  
− Change from baseline in lean mass by visit  
− Change from baseline in fat free mass index  by visit  
− Change from baseline in total skeletal muscle mass by visit  
• Percent and absolute change from baseline in fasting lipids (fasting triglycerides, low -density 
lipoprotein, high -density lipoprotein, total cholesterol), fasting glucose, HbA1c , and fasting 
insulin  by visit  
• Percent and absolute change from baseline in additional laboratory parameters including 
apolipoprotein B (Apo B) , apolipoprotein A1 (Apo A1), Apo  B/Apo A1 , high -sensitivity 
C-reactive protein, interleukin -6, and tumor necrosis factor α  by visit  
• Change from baseline in CGI- S score (between  and within treatment groups ) by visit  
• Change from baseline in CGI-S score (between and within treatment groups) by visi t and by 
diagnosis  
• CGI-I score by visit  
• Change from baseline in IWQOL -Lite score by visit  
Statistical Methods:  In general, summary statistics (n, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum , and 
maximum for continuous variables, and number [%] of subjects in each category for categorical variables) will be provided by treatment group for all variables. Source data f or the summary tables and 
statistical analyses will be presented as subject data listings.  
Study Populations:  The Safety Population will include all randomized subjects who receive at least 
  Alkermes, Inc . 
Protocol ALK3831-A307 Amendment 5.0 CONFIDENTIAL  
Page 6 of 69 one dose of study drug (ALKS  3831 or olanzapine). The efficacy pop ulation, ie full analysis set (FAS), 
will include all subjects in the S afety Population who have at least one post-B aseline weight assessment.  
Efficacy Analyses:  The efficacy analysis will be carried out using the FAS population. The primary 
analysis of the primary endpoint will be carried out using an analysis of covariance method  (ANCOVA)  
based on multiple  imputation (MI) for missing data using on- treatment weight assessments. The model 
will include the treatment group and randomization strata as fac tors and the basel ine weight as the 
covariate. S ensitivity analyses will be carried out to explore the impact of missing data.  
For the categorical  secondary endpoints of proportion of subjects with ≥10% and ≥7% weight gain at 
Week 12, the analyses will be carried out using a logistic regression model based on MI for missing data. 
The model will include the treatment group and randomization strata as factors, and the baseline weight 
as the covariate. For the change from baseline in waist circumference at Week 12, the analysis will be 
based on the ANCOVA method with MI for missing data, same as the primary analysis of the primary 
endpoint. For c hange from baseline in CGI-S within ALKS 3831 Group at Week 12 , the analysis will be  
based on the  mixed model with re peated measurements. The model will include randomization strata, 
treatment, visit, and treatment-by- visit inter action term as factors; the baseline CGI -S value will be 
included as a covariate.  
To control the overall Type I error rate, hierarchical testing will be performed in the following order: (1) percent change from baseline in body weight at Week 12, (2) proportion of subje cts with  ≥10% weight 
gain from baseline at Week 12, (3 ) proportion of subjects with  ≥7% weight gain from baseline at Week 
12, (4) change from baseline in waist circumference at Week 12 , (5) c hange from baseline in CGI -S score 
within the ALKS 3831 Group at Week 12.
 
Safety Analyses:  The safety analysis will be carried out us ing the S afety P opulation. All safety 
assessments will be summarized using descriptive statistics. All safety analyses will be based on observed 
data only, and no missing values will be imputed. Reported AE terms will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) and  summarized by preferred term and system organ 
class categories.  
Observed values and change from baseline in laboratory parameters, vital signs, and ECG parameters will 
be summarized by treatment group and study visit.  
Prior and concomitant medication use will be summarized by World Health Organization Anatomical 
Therapeutic Chemical (WHO  ATC) classification system. Listings will be provided for all concomitant 
medications.  
Pharmacokinetic Analyses: Listings will be provided for concentrations of olanzapine, samidorphan and metabolites of interest. P harmacokinetic concentrations may be used in a subsequent population PK 
analysis conducted outside of this study. 
Sample Size Considerations:  Approximately 425 subjects wi ll be randomiz ed in order to have  400 
subjects in the efficacy population  (200 per treatment group). Assuming the percent weight gain at 
week  12 is 5% and  8.5% for ALKS  3831 and olanzapine groups, respectively, a common standard 
deviation of 8% , and a cumulative dropout rate of 35 %, 200 subjects per treatment group ( 400 subjects in 
total) will provide at least 90% power to demonstrate a difference of ALKS  3831 relative to olanzapine at 
a 2-sided significance level of  0.05.

5.1. Background  
First- and early -episode schizophrenia and bipolar I disorder are critical phases of the diseases 
where optimal antipsychotic efficacy is crucial. Patients in these early stages are at higher risk 
for suicide and violence ( Hawton et al, 2005; Hayes et al, 2015; Hodgins 2008; Kuo et al, 2005) . 
Additionally, many therapeutic experts consider this time in the course of the disease as the best 
opportunity for aggressive treatment in order to retain brain function, alter disease trajectory and 
improve long term treatment outcomes in patients with schizophrenia or bipolar I disorder (Berk 
et al, 2011; Berk et al, 2009; Lieberman et al, 2006; Tohen et al, 2010) . 
Olanzapine has been commercially available for over 20 years as a treatment f or schizophrenia 
and bipolar I disorder (see local olanzapine label ) and is regarded as a highly effective treatment 
with demonstrated antipsychotic efficacy and decreased incidence of extrapyramidal symptoms. 
However, the greater antipsychotic efficacy of olanzapine is undermined by its propensity to cause significant weight gain and increased cardio metabolic risk compared to other atypical 
antipsychotic drugs ( Allison et al, 1999; Leucht et al, 2013; Lieberman et al, 2005; Meyer et al, 
2008; Wirshing et al, 1999) . Drug -induced weight gain is a major problem in terms of reduced 
adherence, treatment discontinuation, and exposure to serious long- term obesity -related risks that 
may shorten life expectancy. In the Clinical Antipsychotic Trials of Intervention Effectiveness (CATIE) study, olanzapine demonstrated robust antipsychotic efficacy with a rapid and 
significant decrease in Positive and  Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS)  and Clinical Global 
Impressions- Severity (CGI -S) scores , as well as the least hospitalizations due to exacerbation of 
schizophrenia compared to other antipsychotics tested , and the lowest all-cause discontinuation 
rate. How ever, a larger proportion of subjects in the olanzapine group (9%) discontinued 
treatment during the 18  month period due to drug-induced weight and metabolic issues compared 
to the other treatment groups (quetiapine: 4%; risperidone:  2%; perphenazine:  1%; and 
ziprasidone: 3% ; (Lieberman et al, 2005 ). Furthermore, for subjects in the olanzapine group with 
Baseline body mass index ( BMI ) ≤30 kg/m
2, weight increased over the study duration (4.7% at 
12 weeks,  7.7% at 24 weeks,  9.3% at 48 weeks , and 10.1% at 60 weeks). From a physician’s 
perspective, olanzapine-induced weight gain and metabolic issues, not lack of efficacy, are the 
primary reasons for discontinuing or not starting treatment with olanzapine. 
Olanzapine is recommended as a second -line treatment in patients early in illness according to 
the Schizophrenia Patien t Outcomes Research Team (PORT) treatment guidelines  (Buchanan et 
al, 2010) . This is largely due to the fact that olanzapine-induced weight gain and metabolic risk 
are especially pronounced in patients who are early in illness  for both schizophrenia and bipolar 
disorder ( Correll et al, 2014) . 
Alkermes is developing ALKS 3831 as a fixed-dose combination of olanzapine and samidorphan 
(a µ-opioid receptor antagonist) to address the serious side effect of weight gain and metabolic 
consequences associated with olanzapine treatment. The novel combination of olanzapine and samidorphan in ALKS  3831 has the potential to deliver the therapeutic benefits of olanzapine to 
patients , while avoiding the harmful weight gain and associated metabolic risks. Th e potential to 
reduce the weight gain and metabolic effects is even more important in patients who are very 
  Alkermes, Inc . 
Protocol ALK3831-A307 Amendment 5.0 CONFIDENTIAL  
Page 15 of 69 early in their illness of schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. In these patients, the weight gain and 
metabolic effects associated with olanzapine treatment are even greater than th ose seen in 
patients who have been treated with multiple different antipsychotics and who are later in the 
course of their illness. 
A Phase 2 study (Study ALK3831-302) was conducted to evaluate the antipsychotic efficacy and 
body weight effect of ALKS  3831 in adults with established schizophrenia (first antipsychotic 
treatment lasted longer than 1  year, symptoms lasting greater than 2  years). In Part A (a 12 -week, 
double-blind, randomized, olanzapine-controlled phase), ALKS 3831 demonstrated similar 
antipsychotic efficacy compared with olanzapine, based on PANSS total score. ALKS 3831 also led to clinically and statistically significantly  less body weight gain compared to olanzapine.  
In a 24-week Phase 3 study ( ALK3831-A303 ) comparing ALKS 3831 and olanzapine treatment , 
ALKS 3831 limited olanzapine-induced weight gain and increases in waist circumference in subjects with schizophrenia. Subjects treated with ALKS 3831 gained less weight across a range 
of clinically meaningful  cutoffs, and had a lower mean percent change in body weight at the end 
of the treatment period . The inclusion of samidorphan in ALKS 3831 limited olanzapine-induced 
weight gain and retained similar antipsychotic efficacy.  
In a 52- week open- label Phase 3 study ( ALK3831-A306) designed t o evalu ate the long -term 
safety and tolerability of ALKS 3831 in subjects with schizophrenia, ALKS 3831 was generally 
well tolerated and continued antipsychotic efficacy was observed. 
A Phase 3 study ( ALK3831-A305) was conducted to evaluate antipsychotic efficacy  and safety 
in adults with an acute exacerbation of schizophrenia. In the  4-week  study ALKS 3831 
demonstrated antipsychotic efficacy as evidenced by a statistically significant and clinically 
meaningful improvement in PANSS and CGI- S scores relative to placebo .  
Another open- label Phase 3 study ( ALK3831- A304 ) is ongoing to assess the efficacy, associated 
weight changes , and long- term safety of ALKS  3831 in adults.  
The current  Phase 3 study will further evaluate the effect of ALKS  3831 compared to olanzapine 
on body weight in young adults with schizophrenia, schizophreniform, or bipolar I disorder with a recent onset of symptoms and early in medical treatment.  
5.2. Study Drugs  
In this study , a fixed -dose combination of olanzapine and samidorphan will be admini stered in a 
single bilayer tablet. The following sections provide an overview of samidorphan and olanzapine. Detailed information about the study drugs can be found in the current ALKS 3831 Investigator’s Brochure . 
5.2.1. Samidorphan 
Samidorphan is a new molecular entity in clinical development by Alkermes. Samidorphan is a µ-opioid receptor antagonist. It is currently being investigated in combination with olanzapine 
for the t reatment of schizophrenia (ALKS 3831) and in combination with buprenorphine for the 
treatment of major depressive disorder (ALKS 5461). Based on its chemical structure, 
samidorphan is considered a Schedule II controlled substance according to the US Drug 
Enforcement Agency , and will require proper handling (see Section  10). At least 10 clinical 
studies of samidorphan have been conducted to date, eight  of which included subjects that 
  Alkermes, Inc . 
Protocol ALK3831-A307 Amendment 5.0 CONFIDENTIAL  
Page 16 of 69 received samidorphan alone (not in combination with another product). Overall, over 
2000 subjects have been exposed to samidorphan as a single agent , or in combination with 
olanzapine or buprenorphine in completed and ongoing clinical studies . Commonly reported 
adverse events (AEs) observed across all studies included nausea, fatigue, and somnolence. Overall, no trends or clinically meaningful changes have been observed in clinical laboratory 
analytes, vital sign parameters, or electrocardiogram (ECG) data.  
5.2.2. Olan zapine  
Olanzapine has been commercially available for over 20 years as a treatment f or schizophrenia 
and bipolar I disorder (see local olanzapine label ). The  safety and tolerability profile of 
olanzapine is well documented, supported by extensi ve clinical studies and clinical experience of  
over 20 years (see local olanzapine label) . Commonly reported AEs consistent across all or most 
dosage forms in short- term, placebo -controlled trials include somnolence, constipation, dry 
mouth, accidental injury, weight gain, postural hypotension, dizziness, asthenia, fever, and abnormal gait.  
5.3. Study Rationale  
This study will be the first study to evaluate the effect of ALKS  3831 compared to olanzapine on 
body weight in subjects  who are very early in their course of illness , have bipolar I disorder, or  
are adolescents . Previous studies of ALKS 3831 have excluded subjects who had less than 1 year 
since initiating first antipsychotic treatment or since the onset of initial symptoms. The  effects of 
the combination of olanzapine and samidorphan to prevent the weight and metabolic changes seen with olanzapine alone are expected to be independent of the diagnosis of the subjects. 
Significant weight gain is seen in both schizophrenia and bipolar subjects treated with olanzapine 
and, thus, it is important to include both diagnoses in a study assessing, in particular,  the 
differences in weight gain s een between olanzapine and ALKS 3831. The onset of schizophrenia 
is rare before the age of 13 , but the rate steadily increases in adolescence, with a peak onset 
of 15 to 30 years  (Sham et al, 1994) . The most common age of onset of bipolar disorder is 
17 to  21 years  (with a mean a ge of onset of 18 years  (Merikangas et al, 2007 ). As the age of 
onset of both disorders is frequently around 18 years old or slightly younger, it was decided in this study to permit the  inclusion in the US of older adolescent  subjects  (≥16  years old). 
Schizophrenia and bipolar I disorder are both characterized by a typical age of onset in the 
early - to mid -twenties ( American Psychiatric Association 2013 ; Blanco et al, 2016) . Gender 
differences have been described wit h schizophrenia such that women tend to experience their 
first episode later than men, showing a peak age of onset in the late twenties, with a second peak in the mid - to late -forties  (Hafner 2003; Rabinowitz et al, 2006) . Given the range of ages over 
which patients can be considered early in illness, this study will include young adults and 
adolescents, ages  16 to 39. 
The major focus of this study is to evaluate weight gain on treatment, irrespective of diagnosis, in a particula rly sensitive population. Based on ALK3831-302, the addition of samidorphan to 
olanzapine in ALKS 3831 does not appear to affect  the antipsychotic efficacy of olanzapine. 
Thus, a ll subjects  in this study  will be treated with active antipsychotic treatment. It is expected 
that the antipsychotic efficacy will be similar in both treatment arms. The antipsychotic efficacy of treatment during the study will be assessed by the CGI -S and CGI -Improvement (CGI-I ) 
scales , which quantify clinicians’ overall impression of clinica l severity and clinical change in 
  Alkermes, Inc . 
Protocol ALK3831-A307 Amendment 5.0 CONFIDENTIAL  
Page 17 of 69 individuals’ psychiatric condition ( Lepping et al, 2011) . The CGI scales have been widely used  
as a primary outcome measure in clinical trials of medications for depression, schizophrenia, and 
many other illness conditions (including bipolar disorder; ( Spearing et al, 1997) . Relapse of 
schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder, or bipolar I disorder will be defined by a worsening in 
a subject’s CGI -S score or a hospitalization for worsening of the underlying illness. Additional 
inform ation regarding nonclinical and clinical studies conducted to date with ALKS  3831 is 
available i n the current version of the Investigator’s Brochure. 
5.4. Dose Rationale  
The selected doses of ALKS  3831 in the current study are supported by the dosing 
recommendations for olanzapine per the local olanzapine label and the clinical safety, 
tolerability , and e fficacy data from prior studies with ALKS  3831. The 10 mg samidorphan dose 
was identified as the minimal effective dose in adults based on the efficacy and optimal safety profile observed in Study ALK3831-302. A fixed dose of samidorphan was selected due to the fact that data from Study  ALK3831-302 demonstrated no correlation between the ratio of 
samidorphan/olanzapine dose and percent change from B aseline in body weight after 12 weeks 
of treatment, indicating that, even with higher olanzapine doses, a fixed dose of samidorphan is sufficient to achieve maximal effect in reducing olanzapine-induced weight gain. 
All subjects will be randomized to receive ALKS  3831 or olanzapine. Treatment assignment will 
be blinded; however, olanzapine dose will be unblinded. The doses of olanzapine will 
be 5, 10, 15, or 20 mg , and the doses of AL KS 3831 will be 5, 10,15, or 20 mg olanzapine 
combined with 10 mg samidor phan (henceforth referred to as 5/10, 10/10, 15/10, or 20/10 mg).  
5.5. Benefit-R isk Assessment  
As stated in the background section, first- and early -episode schizophrenia and bipolar I disorder 
are critical phases of the diseases , where optimal antipsychotic efficacy is crucial. Treatment 
with ALKS 3831 combines the advantages of the antipsychotic efficacy of olanza pine in treating 
both schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, with the potential to mitigate the known effect of olanzapine treatment of excessive weight gain. The antipsychotic efficacy seen in stable subjects treated in study ALK3831-302 was similar between ALKS 3831 and olanzapine as measured by 
Total PANSS and CGI scores. Based on the available data from the completed studies in healthy 
volunteers ( ALK33 -301) and in subjects with schizophrenia (ALK3831-302) , subjects treated 
with ALKS 3831 have been shown to gain less weight compared to subjects treated  with 
olanzapine alone. In ALK3831-302, the prevention of weight gain persisted  during the 3-month 
ALKS 3831 treatment period. 
The important identified risks associated with the use of olanzapine include weight gain, glucose 
dysregulation , and dyslipidemia. For additional information on the known risks of olanzapine, 
see the local label. The safety profile of ALKS 3831 is consistent with that of olanzapine (see 
local label). In study ALK3831-302, the only adverse events reported with ALKS 3831 treatment 
occurring in ≥5% of subjects and at ≥2 times the rate of olanzapine  alone were somnolence, 
sedation, dizziness, and constipation. Notably, these are all labeled events for olanzapine. The 
most common adverse events noted in clinical studies in >2% of subjects with  ALKS 3831 to 
date have been somnolence, dizziness, weight increased, sedation, increased appetite, headache, orthostatic hypotension, and liver function test abnormal (see current ALKS 3831 Investig ator’s 
  Alkermes, Inc . 
Protocol ALK3831-A307 Amendment 5.0 CONFIDENTIAL  
Page 18 of 69 Brochure ). In summary, data from the completed ALKS 3831 studies have demonstrated a 
favorable benefit-risk profile for further investigating ALKS 3831 in subjects with 
schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder, or bipolar I disorder.

If a subject withdraws from the study for any reason , any ongoing AEs will be followed until 
resolution, until deemed stable by the Investigator, or until the subject is deemed by the 
Investigator to be lost to follow -up. If, in the opinion of the Investigator , it is necessary to 
monitor a subject beyond the S afety Follow-up V isit, the Follow-up Period may be extended , 
as necessary. In such instances, the Sponsor and the I nvestigator will agree to an  acceptable 
follow-up schedule. 
In the event that a subject chooses to withdraw from the study, the Investigator should make a 
reasonable effort to ascertain the reason(s) for withdrawal, while fully respecting the subject’s 
rights. Randomized subjects who terminate the treatment early (prior to Visit 9) will be asked to complete an E arly Termination (ET) V isit and the S afety Follow-up Period (Visits  10 and 11). 
The ET V isit should be scheduled as close as possible to the subject’s last dose and will mimic 
the assessments sche duled to be conducted at Visit 9. Subjects  will then be asked to return to the 
study center for biweekly  visits until the end of planned treatment, to collect the following 
information: weight,  waist circumference, body composition, AE s, and concomitant medications . 
If the subject fails or refuses to return to the study center, an attempt must be made to contact the subject by telephone in order to assess as many safety and efficacy parameters as possible. All data collected over the te lephone must be documented and kept in the subject’s record. 
The Investigator must maintain a record of all subjects who fail to complete the study. T he 
reason for study discontinuation will be documented and made on the appropriate electronic  case 
report form (e CRF ). If a subject is lost to follow -up, a reasonable attempt to contact the subject 
must be made and documented.

8.1. Overall Study Design and Plan  
This is a Phase  3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind study to evaluate the effect of 
ALKS  3831 compared to olanzapine on body weight in young adults with schizophrenia, 
schizophreniform disorder, or bipolar I disorder who are early in t heir illness.  
Subjects will be screened at Visit  1, up to 30 days prior to randomization. At Visit 2, eligi ble 
subjects will be randomized  1:1 to ALKS 3831 or olanzapine, and receive study drug for up to 
12 weeks. Randomization will be stratified by diagnosis (schizophrenia/schizophreniform 
disorder vs bipolar I disorder), region  (US vs non- US), and baseline BMI (<25 vs ≥25) . Subjects  
on antipsychotic medication s or mood stabilizers (excluding study medication) should be tapered 
off this medication by the e nd of W eek 2 (Visit 4). Subjects may be inpatient or outpatient at 
Screening ; however , in the opinion of the Investigator, all subjects should be appropriate for 
eventual outpatient treatment. Subjects should be outpatient within 2 weeks postrandomization. 
Cases that require inpatient treatment for longer than 2  weeks will require review and approval 
by the Medical Monitor on a case by case basis.  
Starting with W eek 2 (Visit  4), subjects will come for biweekly visits for the remaining 
10 weeks. Study drug will be provided to subjects as coated bilayer tablets dispensed in blister 
packs at each visit to be taken at home (one tablet by mouth each day, preferably at bedtime). For the first week , at the discretion of the Investigator , subjects will receive 5, 10, 15, or 20 mg 
of olanzapine, or 5/10, 10/10, 15/10, or 20/10 mg of ALKS  3831. At the end of W eek 1, for 
subjects initiated on 5  mg of olanzapine or 5/10 mg of ALKS  3831, the dose will be increased to 
10 mg of olanzapine or 10/10 mg of ALKS  3831. For all other subjects, the dose may also be 
increased to either  15 or 20 mg of olanzapine, or  15/10 or 20/10 mg of ALKS  3831. Following 
this increase, the dose may be increased or decreased to  5, 10, 15, or 20 mg of olanzapine, or 
to 5/10, 10/10, 15/10, or 20/10 m g of ALKS  3831 at the Investigator’s discretion. Dosing will be 
flexible throughout the study; however, frequent adjustments are discouraged. Dose adjustments can only be performed on-site at the study center. Subjects requiring dose adjustments between scheduled visits should arrange an unscheduled visit for the following procedures: study drug 
return and dispensation, adherence review, AE, and concomitant medication monitoring. 
Body weight, body composition (measured by Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis [B IA] using a 
Body Composition Analyzer), and metabolic parameters (including fasting triglycerides, 
cholesterol , and glucose) will be measured throughout the 12- week treatment period. Psychiatric 
symptoms will be evaluated using the CGI  scales. Additional a ssessments will include Impact of 
Weight on Quality of Life – Lite Questionnaire (IWQOL -Lite).  A daily medication adherence 
monitoring and reminder system (via smartphones) may  be used in this study. In addition, 
subjects will be asked to participate in a supportive clinical care (SCC) program during the 12-week treatment period. Participation in the SCC program will be independent of study visits and based on clinician and subject preference.  
The total study duration will be approximately 20 weeks , including a 4- week S creening Period, a 
12-week T reatment P eriod , and a 4 -week Follow-up Period. Subjects completing this study will 
be eligible to enroll in a long -term safety study ( ALK3831-A308), where it is approved by the 
  Alkermes, Inc .

Page 31 of 69 8.3. Study Procedures Descriptions  
Details of the study procedures are described below. The overall schedule of assessments is 
provided in Table 3. 
8.3.1. Informed Consent  
The nature of the study and its risks and benefits will be explained to the subject by the P rincipal 
Investigator or designated study personnel, as outlined in Section  17.3. 
Prior to the administration of any study -specific procedures, authorized study personnel will 
obtain written informed consent /assent , as per local requirements , from each potential subject. 
8.3.2. Eligibility Review  
An eligibility review will be conducted by the Investigator at the visits specified in Table 3 using 
the subject inclusion criteria in Section 7.1 and  exclusion criteria in Section  7.2. Eligibility 
criteria will be reviewed by the Medical Monitor or designee prior to subject randomization .  
8.3.3. Demographics and Medical  / Psychiatric  History  
Subject’s demographic data and medical /psychiatric  history will be reviewed and documented at 
the timepoint specified in Table 3. 8.3.4. Concomitant Medication  Review  
All me dications (prescription and nonprescription, including vitamins and herbal supplements) 
taken by a given subject within 60 days of Screening through Follow-up will be recorded. This 
includes review and recording of all psychotropic and antips ychotic medications.  
At each study visit (see  Table 3), the Investigator or designee will record the following data on 
all me dications used by the subject: name, dose, regimen, route of administration, start and stop 
dates , and the indication for use.  
8.3.5. Vital Signs  
Vital signs (ie, blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and oral body temperature) will be assessed at the timepoints specified in Table 3. An effort will be made to consistently use the 
same arm (preferably the subject’s dominant arm) to measure blood pressure and heart rate throughout the study. The blood pressure cuff will be calibrated per study site standard operating procedures (SOP). Automated measurement is preferred, but if performed manually, heart rate will be measured in the brachial artery for at lea st 30 seconds. 
Blood pressure, heart rate, and respiratory rate will  be measured after the subject has been  in the 
supine position for at least 5 minutes.  Vital signs may be collected at any time during a 
scheduled visit, unless otherwise noted. 
8.3.6. Physical Examination 
A physical examination will be performed at the timepoints specified in Table  3. Full physical 
examination at S creening (Visit  1); brief physical examination at all other indicated visits.  
  Alkermes, Inc.  
Protocol ALK3831-A307 Amendment 5.0  CONFIDENTIAL  
Page 32 of 69 8.3.7. Height, Body Weight, Body  Composition Analysis, and Waist Circumference  
Height will be measured at S creening only . Waist circumference will be measured at all the 
timepoints specified in Table 3, and will be measured 3 consecutive times at each time point. The 
Body Composition Analyz er will collect multiple measures related to body composition using 
BIA, including, but not limited to , weight, fat mass, lean mass, and percentage body fat , at all the 
timepoints specified in Table 3. 
For the Body Composition Analyzer measurements, subjects should be asked to void 
immediately prior to measurement and should be dressed in a hospital gown with consistent 
under- attire for ea ch measurement. Subjects should remove all personal items (including shoes, 
watches , and jewelry ) and they should be weighed on a study-approved and calibrated scale for 
each measurement under the same conditions. The body composition analysis should not be performed when the subject is attached to any portable electronic equipment ( eg, a portable ECG 
machine). 
8.3.8. 12-Lead Electrocardiogram  
A 12 -lead ECG  will be conducted at the time points specified in Table 3. All scheduled ECGs 
must be performed after the subject ha s rested quietly for at least 5  minutes in the supine 
position. 
A qualified clinician will conduct ECGs and assess ECG results using equipment that has been 
calibrated according to the site’s SOP . The following ECG parameters will be collected: pulse, 
RR, PR, QRS, QT, QTcF , and QT interval corrected using the Bazett fo rmula (QTcB).  
All ECGs  will be evaluated by a central reader.  
8.3.9. Structured Interviews and Questionnaires  
Brief descriptions of each of the interviews and questionnaires to be distributed are available 
below. All interviews and questionnaires will be administered by trained and qualified study personnel. 
For assessments performed at multiple visits, every effort should be made to pair the same 
clinician/rater with the same subject across visits.  
Table 3 provides information on the timepoints at which each assessment should be administered.  
8.3.9.1. Rater Review  
Rater (ie, study staff) accuracy for the MINI interview at Screening will be reviewed by central raters.  Rater review is necessary for mitigating inaccurate inclusion/exclusion assessments.  
Rater assessments require subject interviews to be audio recorded. The audio recording will be disclosed and explained to the subject by study staff and will be disclosed in the ICF during the informed consent process. No subject will be recorded without the knowledge that a recording is being made.

Neuropsychiatric Interview for Children a nd Adolescents  
The Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview 7.0 for Schizophrenia and Psychotic Disorder 
Studies (MINI v7.0) and the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview for Children and 
Adolescents 7.0 for Schizophrenia and Psychotic Disorder Studies (MINI KID v7.0) are short, 
clinician -administered, structured diagnostic interviews, with an administ ration time of 
approximately 15 minutes  (Sheehan  et al, 1998) . The MINI v7.0 and MINI KID v7.0 have been 
validated against the much longer Structured Clinical Interview for DSM Diagnoses. The MINI v7.0 and MINI KID  v7.0 will be administered by the PI or designee at the timepoints  in Table 3. 
The MINI v7.0 will be conducted with subjects ≥18 years of age and the MINI KID  v7.0 will be 
conducted with subj ects <18  years of age . 
8.3.9.3. Safety Assessments 
8.3.9.3.1. Columbia -Suicide Severity Rating Scale  
The PI or designee will administer the C-SSRS according to the timepoints in Table 3. T he 
“Baseline/Screening” version of the C- SSRS w ill be completed at S creen ing (Posner et al, 
2009a ). The “Since Last Visit” version will be completed at all other scheduled timepoints 
(Posner et al, 2009b) . The C -SSRS should be administered by a qualified clinician trained in 
assessing and managing suicidal ideation and behavior. 
8.3.9.4. Antipsychotic Efficacy Assessments  
For assessments performed at multiple timepoints , every effort should be made to pair the same 
clinician/rater with the same subject ac ross timepoints . 
8.3.9.4.1. Clinical Global I mpressions -Severity  
The PI or designee will complete the CGI -S scale at the timepoints specified in Table 3. The 
CGI-S measures mental illness severity. Clinicians are asked to rate subjects based on their prior 
experience working with individuals in a similar patient population ( Guy 1976) . 
8.3.9.4.2. Clinical Global Impressions -Improvement  
The PI or designee will complete the CGI -I scale at the timepoints specified in Table 3. The 
CGI-I measures mental illness improvement. Clinicians are asked to rate subjects based on their 
prior experience working with individuals in a similar patient population ( Guy 1976) . 
8.3.9.5. Other Assessments

Subjects will be offered  SCC during the 12- week Treatment Period. Participation in the SCC 
program will be independent of study visits and based on clinical and subj ect preference. The 
SCC component modules may include individual psychotherapy, supported education services, 
and family education and support. Investigators and subjects will be able to select the modules to 
be used based on their judgment of appropriateness. The use of any or  all modules will not be 
mandatory for each subject. 
8.3.11. Laboratory Assessments 
8.3.11.1. Drug Testing  
A urine drug test for opioids and drugs of abuse, including amphetamine/methamphetamine, 
phencyclidine, and cocaine , will be performed at the timepoints specified in Table 3. Results 
must be negative at S creening (Visit 1) and B aseline (Visit 2) for the subject to be eligible for the 
study.  Centralized drug testing will be performed at Screening  (Visit 1) and  local drug testing 
(via dipstick) at other timepoints , as specified in Table 3. The urine drug screen may be repeated 
at any point during the study based on the Investigator’s discretion. 
8.3.11.2. Hematology, Biochemistry, and Urinalysis 
Fasting blood and urine samples for laboratory assessments will be collected at the timepoints 
specified in Table 3 for specific hematology, biochemistry, and ur inalysis assessments listed in 
Table 4. Subjects will be instructed not to eat or drin k anything (except water) for 8  hours before

subject from participation immediately , as indicated in Section  7.3 
8.3.11.3. Urine Pregnancy Testing  
A urine pregnancy test will be administered  to all women at the timepoints  specified in Table 3. 
Results must be negative for the subject to be eligible for the study at S creening (Visit 1) and 
Baseline (Visit 2).  As highlighted in Section  7.3, a positive pregnancy test result at any time will 
necessitate the subject’s immediate withdrawal from the study. Additional follow -up may be 
necessary , as indicated in  Section  8.4.1. 
8.3.12. Serology Testing 
A blood sample for a serology panel testing for hepatitis B surface antigen, anti -hepatitis  C 
antibodies, and HIV  will be performed at S creening only , as specified in Table  3. A positive 
hepatitis C antibody test must be confirmed by RNA testing to be exclusionary. 
8.3.13. Genotype Sampling  
A blood sample may be collected (at the timepoint indicated in Table 3) for evaluation of 
genotypes that are potentially related to response and to explore potential genetic associations with efficacy, adverse effects, symptoms , or outcomes. No other tests will b e performed with 
these samples.  
8.3.14. Pharmacokinetic Assessments 
Concentrations of olanzapine, samidorphan, and metabolites of interest will be determined from plasma samples collected according to the schedule in Table 3. The time of last study drug 
admi nistration (when applicable) and the time of each pharmacokinetic ( PK) blood draw must be 
documented in the subject’s source documents. Samples for PK analysis will be stored 
at -20°C ±10°C. P harmacokinetic data from these samples may be included in a subsequent 
population PK analysis or other post-hoc analyses conducted outside of this study. 
8.3.15. Randomization 
At the timepoints specified in Table 3, subjects will be randomized, as outlined in Section  9.3. 
8.3.16. Drug Dispensation and Reconciliation  
Section  9 provides information related to drug dispensing procedures. Study drug will be 
dispensed/administered  at the timepoints specified in Table 3. The study drug use and storage 
information will be explained to/reviewed with the subject.  
8.3.16.1. Medication Adherence and Reminder System  
A daily medication adherence monitoring and reminder system (via smartphones) may  be used in 
this study to  automatically  confirm medication ingestion. After confirmation, all collected data 
and video recordings will be encrypted and may be transmitted to a  secure centralized location , 
in accordance with local regulations , for further analysis, including testing for duplicate

Page 37 of 69 enrollment.  The captured data and video are reviewable only through a roles- and rules- restricted 
system ensuring privacy of the infor mation. The system is compliant with the Health Insurance 
Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), which protects the privacy and security of 
healthcare information. In addition, built- in reminders and a communication system will allow 
real-time interve ntion in case of drug interruptions. Phone numbers of the patients may also be 
collected and stored in an encrypted manner. At no time is the phone number visible to healthcare providers or monitoring personnel. Use of this system will in no way supersede or replace the physician - and/or trial-prescribed medication protocol of the patients. 
8.3.17. Emergency Treatment Card  
An emergency treatment card will be distributed to each subject at S creening ( Visit 1) and 
collected at Visit 9. The card will indicate that the  subject is receiving an opioid antagonist 
and/or olanzapine, and will include the PI’s contact information, a suggested pain management 
plan, and information regarding opiate blockade. Subjects will be instructed to keep the card with 
them at all times. S tudy personnel will confirm that subjects have the card in their possession at 
each study visit.  
8.3.18. Adverse Event Monitoring  
All AEs will be monitored continuously from the time a subject signs the informed consent document until the completion of the final s tudy visit (see Table 3). A dverse event s and serious 
AEs (SAEs) are defined in Section  13.1 and 13.2, respectively. Section  13.4 provides guidance 
on the monitoring and recording requirements for AEs. Section  13.5 provides guidance on the 
reporting requirements for SAEs.  
8.4. Study Requirements and Restrictions  
8.4.1. Contraception and Pregnancy  
All male and female subjects must agree to use an acceptable method of contraception for the duration of the study. All female subjects must agree to use an acceptable method for 30 days 
after the last dose of study drug, unless they are surgically  sterile or postmenopausal (see below). 
The following are considered acceptab le methods of contraception: 
1. Intrauterine device  
2. Oral contraceptive pills and other hormonal methods (eg, a vaginal ring, contraceptive patch, contraceptive implant)  
3. Double-barrier protection (eg, a condom with spermicide or a diaphragm with spermicide)  
4. Abstinence (see below)  
Subjects who are abstinent are eligible, provided they agree to use an acceptable contraceptive 
method should they become sexually active. Abstinence is defined as “true abstinence” in which 
subjects must refrain from hete rosexual in tercourse for the full duration of the study and  must be 
in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject. Periodic abstinence (eg, calendar, 
ovulation, symptothermal, postovulation methods), declaration of abstinence for the duration of exposure to the study drug, and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.

Page 38 of 69 Subjects who are surgically sterile are exempt from the requirement to use contraception. 
Women who have undergone a hysterectomy, bilateral tubal ligation, or bilateral 
salpingo-oophorectomy are considered surgically sterile. Men who have undergone a vasectomy 
are considered surgically sterile. Partner vasectomy is not considered an approved acceptable method of cont raception for a female subject.  
Women who are postmenopausal are also exempt from the requirement to use contraception. For the purpose of this study, postmenopausal is defined as the permanent cessation of menstruation for at least 12  months prior to Screening in women who are 45 years of age or older.  
If a subject becomes pregnant while participating in the study, she will be discontinued from study drug immediately. The ET and S afety F ollow -up V isits will be scheduled  and t he 
pregnancy will be reported to Alkermes. Additional follow -up may be required. Pregnancies in 
female partners of male subjects should also be reported and will be followed in the same manner.  If a female partner of a male subject becomes pregnant, she may be required to sign an 
informed consent form to obtain pregnancy follow-up information, per local require ments . 
A Pregnancy Report Form must be submitted to Alkermes via Premier Research Group Limited 
(per Section  13.5) immediately , within 24 hours of awareness of the pregnancy, irrespective of 
whether an AE has occurred. The pregnancy will be followed until completion or termination. If 
the outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for classification as an SAE , it should be 
reported f ollowing the SAE procedure (see Section  13.5).  
8.4.2. Prohibited Medications  
The use of any antipsychotic other than study drug is prohibited, except when subjects are tapering off of current medication (see Section  8.1). T he following medications will be 
prohibited for the duration of the study, unless otherwise indicated : 
• The following psychotropic medications, other than study drug: 
− Antipsychotics (subjects must be tapered off any previous antipsychotic 
medications within 14 days after randomization) 
− Antidepressants for bipolar I disorder subjects at V isit 1 and V isit 2 ( subjects may 
be initiated on antidepressants after Visit 2, as described in Section  8.4.3) 
− Mood stabilizers (subjects must be tapered off any mood stabilizer medications 
within 14 days  after randomization)  
• Chantix
® (varenicline; however , nicotine replacement therapy , including nicotine 
replacement patch and oral nicotine gum, is permitted)  
• All prescription or over-the-counter (OTC) agents taken for the purpose of weight 
reduction 
• Systemic steroids administered by oral, intravenous, or intramuscular route 
• Topiramate (Topamax®) and combination products containing topiramate; c alcitonin 
(eg, Miacalcin®) 
• Diabetes treatments and hypoglycemic agents , including metformin and insulin 
  Alkermes, Inc.  
Protocol ALK3831-A307 Amendment 5.0  CONFIDENTIAL  
Page 39 of 69 • Moderate- to-strong inducers or inhibitors of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A 
(prescription medications, OTC medications, or dietary supplements) within 30 days 
before randomization through Follow-up (refer to Appendix A  for a list of CYP3A 
inhibitors and inducers) 
The CRO Me dical Monitor should be consulted for any questions about use of any psychotropic 
medications during a subject’s participation in this study.  
8.4.3. Permitted Medications  
• Medications that exhibit drug interaction potential with olanzapine, including known inhibitors and inducers of CYP1A2 ( Appendix B ), may affect olanzapine 
concentrations. Hence, investigators must use caution with inhibitors and inducers of CYP1A2 and monitor for need for study drug dose adjustment  
• Medicinal products known to be associated with increase in QTc interval should be used with caution given the increased risk of torsade de pointes ( Appendix C ) 
• Oral contraceptive pills and other hormonal methods (eg, a vaginal ring, 
contraceptive patch, contraceptive implant) will be permitted  
• Antidepressants 
− Bipolar I disorder: Antidepressants are not permitted at V isit 1 and V isit 2. 
However, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressant may be 
initiated during the  Treatment P eriod , if clinically indicated. Treatment with 
SSRI s that may cause significant weight gain should be avoided (eg, paroxetine). 
− Schizophrenia and schizophreniform disorder: May remain on the medication if 
stable on antidepressants for greater than 30 days prior to study entry. However, 
an SSRI  antidepressant may be initiated during the T reatment P eriod , if clinically 
indicated. Treatment with SSRIs that may cause significant weight gain should be avoided (eg, paroxetine). 
8.4.4. Pain Management 
Because ALKS  3831 contains samidorphan, a μ -opioid antagonist, subjects may experience 
reduced or ineffective analgesia when taking an opioid analgesic agent concurrently with ALKS  3831, including several days after last dosing of ALKS 3831. 
In the event of an emergency, pain management of the subject should include the following: 
• Regional analgesia or use of non -opioid analgesics 
• If opiate anesthesia or analgesia is required, the subject should be continuously monitored, in an anesthesia care setting, by persons not involved in the conduct of the surgical or diagnostic procedure. The opioid therapy must be provided by individuals 
specifically trained in the use of anesthetic drugs and the management of the 
respiratory effects of potent opioids, specifically the establishment and the maintenance of a patent airway and assi sted ventilation  
  Alkermes, Inc.  
Protocol ALK3831-A307 Amendment 5.0  CONFIDENTIAL  
Page 40 of 69 • Close monitoring by appropriately trained personnel in a setting equipped and staffed 
for cardiopulmonary resuscitation 
For subjects requiring emergency opioid analgesics prior to dosing, the study drug should not be 
administered. If opioid analgesics are required after the study drug has been dosed, it may take 
several days for opiate sensitivity to be restored, since samidorphan functions as a μ -opioid 
antagonist and could interfere with opioid- mediated pain management.  
8.4.5. Fasting  
Subjects are required to fast for at least 8  hours (no food or drink, except water) prior to 
laboratory blood draws.

Page 41 of 69 8.4.6. Other Restrictions and Requirements  
Additional restrictions and requirements include: 
• Prohibited substances include opioids, amphetamines (including methamphetamine), 
cocaine, and phencyclidine 
• Subjects will be required to abstain from blood or blood product donation during the 
study and for 30 days following the Follow-up V isit 
• Subjects will be instructed to maintain their normal caffeine intake and/or tobacco 
use, as well as normal activity/exercise, throughout the study. Subjects will be asked to abstain from strenuous physical activity for 48 hours prior to each study visit 
• Subjects are prohibited from participating in a weight management progr am 
(including weight loss surgery) or from entering a smoking cessation program for the duration of the study 
• Subjects will be asked to refrain from driving, operating machinery, or engaging in hazardous activities until they and the Investigator are sure the study drug is not impairing their judgment and/or ability to perform skilled tasks

Page 42 of 69 9. TREATMENT OF SUBJECTS 
9.1. Study Drug Dose and Administration  
Study drugs include: 
• ALKS  3831 5/10, 10/10, 15/10, or 20/10 mg, administered as a coated bilayer tablet  
• Olanzapine 5, 10, 15, or 20 mg , administered as a coated bilayer tablet  
For the f irst week , at the discretion of the I nvestigator, subjects will receive  5, 10, 15, or 20 mg 
of olanzapine or 5/10, 10/10, 15/10, or 20/10 mg of A LKS  3831. At the end of W eek 1, for 
subjects initiated on 5  mg of olanzapine or 5/10 mg of ALKS  3831, the dose will be increased to 
10 mg of olanzapine or 10/10 mg of ALKS  3831. For all other subjects, the dose may also be 
increased to either  15 or 20 mg of olanzapine, or  15/10 or 20/10 mg of ALKS  3831. Following 
this increase, the dose may be increased or decreased to 5, 10, 15, or 20 mg of olanzapine, or 
to 5/10, 10/10, 15/10, or 20/10 mg of ALKS 3831, at the Investigator’s discretion. Dosing will be 
flexible throughout the study; however, frequent adjustments are discouraged. Dose adjustments can only be performed on- site at the study center.  
For subjects requiring initial inpatient care, study drug  will be administered orally, once daily , 
preferably at bedtime. Following discharge, subjects will be given study drug to take home and 
will be instructed to take one tablet orally , preferably at bedtime. If there are tolerability 
problems, dosing may be switched to another time, based on the judgment of the Investigator; 
frequent switching is discouraged. 
Subjects will be instructed to keep all unused tablets in their blister card and to return unused 
tablets to the study site at their next visit. If dosing is to occur at that visit, the dose should be taken from the subject’s next blister card, not from the card they are returning.  
If a dose is missed or forgotten, subjects will be instructed to resume regular dosing the 
following night. Subjects will be instructed not to take a double dose to try to “make up” for the missed dose. 
9.2. Treatment Adherence  
A daily medication adherence monitoring and reminder system (via smartphones) may  be used in 
this study  (as described in Section  8.3.16.1). Subjects will be instructed to keep all unused tablets 
in their original containers  and to return the original containers with any unused study drug at 
each visit following dispensation. Study drug accountability will be documented as the number of tablets dispensed, dosed, lost/missing, or remaining. If applic able, the site will discuss 
nonadherence with the subject.  
9.3. Randomization/Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatment  
Subjects meeting eligibility criteria at baseline (Visit 2) will be randomized in a (1:1) ratio to 
ALKS  3831 or olanzapine. The randomization will be stratified by diagnosis 
(schizophrenia/schizophreniform disorder vs bipolar I disorder) , region (US vs non- US), and 
baselin e BMI (<25 vs ≥25) . 
  Alkermes, Inc.  
Protocol ALK3831-A307 Amendment 5.0  CONFIDENTIAL  
Page 43 of 69 Randomization will be performed centrally through an Interactive Web Response System 
(IWRS). A unique randomization number will be assigned by the IWRS once eligibility has been 
determined. Once a randomization number has been assigned, that number must not be used again if, for example, a subject is withdrawn from the study. Codes will be prepared by an independent biostatistician who is not otherwise involved in this study. 
9.4. Blinding  
All Alkermes staff, CRO staff, clinical staff, subjects , and caregivers will be blinded to treatment 
assignment until database lock. 
The PI  is responsible for all trial- related medical decisions. If the Investigator deems it necessary 
to break the study blind in the interest of a subject’s medical safety, he or she is encouraged  to 
contact the CRO /Sponsor M edical Monitor to discuss their rationale for unblinding. However, to 
prevent delays to the I nvestigator or medical personnel responding to a potentially emergent 
situation, unblinding of study drug will not be dependent upon the Investigator receiving 
approval from the Sponsor/CRO M edical Monitor (ie, the Investigator will be able to obtain the 
code break information independent of the Sponsor/CRO M edical Monitor ). If the site is unable 
to contact the M edical Monitor prior to breaking the blind, the M edical Monitor must be 
contacted within 24 hours following disclosure of study drug assignment. Any premature unblinding should be promptly documented and explained to the M edical Monitor. 
Breaking the blind for a single subject will not affect the blind for the remaining subjects.

Page 45 of 69 Under the US Controlled Substances Act, samidorphan is cons idered a Schedule II substance 
because it is derived from opium alkaloids. Therefore, samidorphan and/or blinded study drug 
must be stored in accordance with restrictions related to Schedule II substances. The site will take adequate precautions, including storage of the investigational drug in a securely locked, 
substantially constructed cabinet, or other securely locked, substantially constructed enclosure, 
access to which is limited, to prevent theft or diversion of the substance. 
10.4. Accountability  
The clinical site is required to maintain current drug dispensation and accountability logs 
throughout the study. All unused supplies will be checked against the drug movement records 
during the study and/or at the end of the study. 
Refer to Section  8.3.16 for additional study drug reconciliation procedures. 
10.5. Handling and Disposal  
Following completion and verification of accountability logs, all unused and used packages must 
be destroyed. Packages may be destroyed on site according to Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and

Page 49 of 69 13. ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY 
Safety will be assessed on the basis of:  
• AEs 
• Vital signs (ie, oral temperature, respiratory rate, blood pressure, and heart rate)  
• Clinical laboratory parameters , including chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis 
• ECG results  
• C-SSRS  
13.1. Definition of Adverse Event  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject who has 
been administered a pharmaceutical product. The occurrence, which may or may not have a causal relationship with the investigational treatment, may include any clinical or laboratory change that does not commonly occur in that subject and is considered clinically significant. 
Illnesses present prior to the subject signing the ICF are considered to be pre-existing conditions 
and are documented on the medical history eCRF. Pre -existing conditions that worsen during the 
study are entered on the AE eCRF.  
All out-of- range laboratory values will be deemed as clinically significant or not clinically 
significant by the Investigator. Clinically significant values will be c onsidered AEs and will be 
recorded as such on the eCRFs.  
Pregnancy is not considered an AE, although a subject will be withdrawn from the study if a pregnancy occurs. As described in Section  8.4.1, the pregnancy, including a partner’s pregnancy, 
must be reported to Alkermes, and additional follow-up may be required. 
Transition from schizophreniform to schizophrenia is not considered an AE, unless deemed so by 
the Investigator.  
13.2. Definition of Serious Adverse Event  
An SAE is any AE, occurring at any dose and regardless of causality, that: 
• Results in death  
• Is life -threatening. The subject is at immediate risk of death from the reaction as it 
occurs. This does not include a reaction that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death  
• Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  
• Results in persistent and significant disability /incapacity (eg, a su bstantial disruption 
of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions) 
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
  Alkermes, Inc.  
Protocol ALK3831-A307 Amendment 5.0  CONFIDENTIAL  
Page 50 of 69 Important medical events that may not result in death, be immediately life -threatening, or require 
hospitalization may be considered to be SAEs when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, 
they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed above.  
Admission to a hospital or an inpatient unit for a non medical reason (ie, social stay admission) 
during the study, in the absence of an untoward medical occurrence, will not be considered an 
SAE , but will be reported as an AE. Hospitalization due to  worsening of behavioral health-
related issues should be reported as an SAE. 
13.3. Relationship to Study Drug  
The assessment of study drug relationship to each AE will be reported on the appropriate source document (and SAE form, in the event of an SAE) by the Investigator (or designated 
Subinvestigator) according to his/her best clinical judgment. T he criteria listed in Table 5 should 
be used to guide this assessment. Please note that not all criteria must be present to be indicative 
of a particul ar drug relationship. All study drugs are considered “test drugs” for the purposes of 
the definitions listed in the table.

Page 52 of 69 13.4. Monitoring and Recording of Adverse Events  
Adverse event  data collection will begin after a subject signs the ICF  and will continue until 
completion of the S afety Follow-up V isit (Visit 11). Any AE or SAE having an onset after the 
Safety Follow-up V isit will not be collected or reported unless the Investigator feels that the 
event may be related to the study drug. 
Subjects will be instructed by the Investigator or designee to report the occurrence of any AE. 
All volunteered, elicited, and observed AEs are to be recorded on the AE eCRFs. 
The Investigator will assess all AEs regarding any causal relationship to the stud y drug 
(see Section  13.3) , the intensity (severity) of the event, action taken, and subject outcome. 
The following criteria should be used to guide the assessment of intensity (severity):  
• Mild:  Causes awareness of sign or symptom, but is easily tolerated; does not interfere 
with usual activities  
• Moderate:  Causes discomfort enough to interfere with usual activities  
• Severe:  Is incapacitating; results in  inability to work or perform usual activities  
All AEs will be followed until resolution, until deemed stable by the Investigator , or until the 
subject is deemed by the Investigator to be lost to follow-up. 
For clinical study safety reporting purposes, the most recent version of the Investigator’s 
Brochure w ill be used as the reference document to designate event expectedness.  
Withdrawal from the study as a result of an AE, and any therapeutic measures that are taken , 
shall be at the discretion of the Inves tigator . If a subject withdraws from the study for any reason , 
any ongoing AEs will be followed until resolution, until deemed stable by the Investigator, or until the subject is deemed by the Investigator to be lost to follow -up. 
13.5. Reporting of Serious Adve rse Events  and Pregnancy  
All SAEs and pregnancies must be reported to Alkermes via Premier Research Group 
Limited  immediately , within  24 hours of discovery, by emailing or faxing the report to the

14.1. Sample Size Considerations  
Approximately 425 subjects will be  randomized in order to have 400 subjects (200 per treatment 
group) in the efficacy population. Assuming the percent weight gain at W eek 12 is 5% and 8.5% 
for ALKS  3831 and olanzapine groups, respectively, a common standard deviation of 8%, and a 
cumulative dropout rate of 35%, 200 subjects per treatment group (400 subjects in total) will 
provide at least  90% power to demonstrate a difference of ALKS  3831 relative to olanzapine at a 
two-sided significance level of 0.05. 
14.2. General Statistical Methodology 
The statistical analysis methods are described below. Additional details are provided in the 
Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) . 
Baseline is defined as  the last nonmissing values on or before the first dose of study drug in the 
double-blind T reatment Period. 
In general, summary statistics (n, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum and maximum for 
continuous variables, and number [%] of subjects in each category for categorical variables) will 
be provided by treatment group for all variables. 
Source data for the summary tables and statistical analyses will be presented as subject data 
listings.  
All statistical tests and confidence intervals, unless stated otherwise, will be two-sided and will 
be set at α=0.05.  
14.2.1. Study Populations 
14.2.1.1. Safety Population 
The S afety Population, defined as all randomized subjects who receive at least one dose of study 
drug (ALKS  3831 or olanzapine) , will be used in the safety analyses.  
14.2.1.2. Efficacy Population 
The E fficacy P opulation (i e, full analysis set [ FAS]), defined as all subjects in the S afety 
Population who have at least one postbaseline weight assessment, will be used in the efficacy 
analyses.  
14.3. Demographics and Baseline Data  
Demographics and baseline characteristics , such as gender, age, race, weight, BM I, and 
psychiatric history, will be summarized with descriptive statistics.  If there are heterogeneities 
between study groups in any of the subject characteristics that are of clinical importance or could affect the treatment outcome, the impact of the imb alances will be investigated and, if necessary, 
appropriate adjustments will be made in the efficacy and safety analyses.

Page 55 of 69 14.4. Efficacy Analyses  
All efficacy analyses will be based on the FAS Population.  
Primary Endpoint  
The primary endpoint is: 
• Percent change from baseline in body weight at Week 12 
The primary analysis will be carried out using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) method 
based multiple  imputation (MI) for missing data. The model will include the treatment group and 
randomization strata as factor s, and the baseline weight as the covariate. Sensitivity analyses will 
be carried out to explore the impact of missing data. 
Secondary Endpoint s 
The secondary endpoints are: 
• Proportion of subjects with ≥10%  weight gain at Week 12  
• Proportion of subjects with ≥7%  weight gain at Week 12  
• Change from baseline in  waist circumference at Week 12  
• Change from baseline in CGI -S score within the ALKS 3831 Group at Week 12 
For the categorical secondary endpoints of p roportion of subjects with ≥10%  and ≥7%  weight 
gain at Week 12 , the analyses will be carried out using a logistic regression model based on MI  
for missing data. The model will include the treatment group and randomization strata as factors, 
and the baseline weight as the covariate.  For the chan ge from ba seline in waist circumference at 
Week 12, the analysis will be based on the ANCOVA method with MI for missing data, same as 
the primary analysis of the primary endpoint. For change from baseline in CGI- S within 
ALKS  3831 Group at Week 12, the analysis will be based on the mixed model with repeated 
measurements  (MMRM) . The model will include randomization strata, treatment, visit, and 
treatment -by-visit interaction term as factors; the baseline CGI -S value will be included as a 
covariate.  
To control the overall Type I error rate, hierarchical testing will be performed in the following order: (1) percent change from baseline in body weight at W eek 12 , (2) proportion of subjects 
with ≥10% weight gain from baseline at W eek 12 , (3) proportion of subject s with  ≥7% weight 
gain from baseline at Week 12 , (4) c hange from baseline in waist circumference at Week 12 , (5) 
change from baseline in CGI-S score within the ALKS 3831 Group at Week 12. 
Other Endpoint s 
Other endpoints are: 
• Absolute change from baseline in body weight by visit 
• Proportion of subjects with ≥5 cm  increase from baseline in waist circumference at 
Week 12  
• Body composition endpoints, as assessed by bioimpedance analysis , including

• Change from baseline in CGI -S score (between and within treatment group s) by visit 
and by diagnosis 
• CGI-I score by visit  
• Change from baseline in IWQOL -Lite score by visit  
Absolute change from baseline in body weight and all body composition endpoints will be analyzed using ANCOVA method with MI for missing data, same as the primary analysis of the 
primary endpoint. 
The p roportion of subjects with ≥5 cm increa se from baseline in  waist circumference at Week 12  
will be analyzed by logistic regression model based on MI for missing data, in a similar fashion 
as the proportion of subjects with ≥10% weight gain.  
The percent and absolute change from baseline in the laboratory parameters will be analyzed by 
MMRM model. The model will include randomization strata, treatment, visit, and 
treatment -by-visit interaction term as factors ; the corresponding baseline value will be included 
as a covariate.  
Change from baseline in CGI-S score between and within ALKS 3831 and olanzapine treatment groups (by visit, and by visit and by diagnosis) and change from  baseline in IWQOL -Lite will be 
analyzed  similarly  by MMRM model. 
CGI-I score, and CGI -I responder status (≤2 versus >2) at each visit will be summarized by 
descriptive statistics.  
Details of statistical methods will be listed in SAP .

 CLINICAL TRIAL SUMMARY 
 
COMPOUND: GZ402665 
(olipudase alfa) STUDY No: DFI13803 
TITLE A phase 1/2, multi-center, open-label, ascending dose study to evaluate the 
safety, tolerability, pharmacokineti cs, pharmacodynamics, and exploratory 
efficacy of olipudase alfa in pediatric patients aged <18 years with acid sphingomyelinase deficiency 
INVESTIGATOR/TRIAL LOCATION Multi-national and multi-center. More than one region as needed to allow 
enrollment of sufficient numbers of patients in a reasonable time. Potential 
countries include but are not limited to United States, United Kingdom, Italy, 
Brazil, Germany, and France. 
PHASE OF DEVELOPMENT 1/2 
STUDY OBJECTIVE(S) Primary objective: To evaluate the safety and tolerability of olipudase alfa 
administered intravenously in pediatric patients every 2 weeks for 64 weeks. 
Secondary objective(s): To characterize the pharmacokinetic profile and 
evaluate the pharmacodynamics and explor atory efficacy of olipudase alfa 
administered intravenously in pediatric patients every 2 weeks for up to 64 
weeks.  
STUDY DESIGN This is a phase 1/2, multi-national, multi-center, open-label, ascending-dose study designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, 
pharmacodynamics, and exploratory efficacy of olipudase alfa administered 
once every 2 weeks for 64 weeks in pediatric patients, aged <18 years, with 
non-neuronopathic acid sphingomyelinase deficiency (ASMD). 
At least 12 pediatric patients will be enrolled in a staggered fashion into the 
following 3 age cohorts and dose escalated to 3.0 mg/kg olipudase alfa or the 
highest tolerated dose (HTD): 
1. Adolescent cohort – patients aged 12 to <18 years  
2. Child cohort – patients aged 6 to <12 years  
3. Infant/early child cohort – patients from birth to <6 years of age. 
Initiation of dosing will be staggered among the three pediatric age cohorts. The adolescent cohort will begin dosing before the child cohort, and the child cohort 
will begin dosing before the infant/early child cohort. Patients in the child and 
infant /early child cohorts will not be dosed until a review of all safety data has 
occurred from the first 3 patients in t he respective adolescent and child cohorts 
who completed the dose escalation phase. 
At least 8 additional pediatric patients (<12 years), corresponding to the age 
range of the child and the infant/early ch ild cohorts, will then be enrolled. These 
patients will be enrolled and treated without age cohort staggering.   
After the 64 week-treatment phase, eligible patients may enroll in the long-term 
study LTS13632 to continue receiving olipudase alfa.

 used as the primary population for the efficacy analysis.  
The pharmacodynamic population includes all patients who have at least 1 
infusion of study medication and have at least 1 evaluable pharmacodynamic 
data.measurement available post-baseline.  
 Safety Analysis:  Safety analyses will include a summary of treatment 
duration, the total number of infusions received, and the total amount of 
olipudase alfa received. Frequencies (number and percentage) of patients with 
one or more treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) will be summarized 
according to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) System 
Organ Class (SOC) and Preferred Term (PT) overall and by age group. All 
TEAEs, including those potentially related to study drug, those leading to 
treatment discontinuation and study discontinuation, infusion-associated 
reactions, serious adverse events (SAEs), and all AEs with fatal outcome 
(including fatal TEAEs) will be summarized overall and by age group. Other safety variables, including laborator y parameters and vital signs, will be 
summarized overall and by age group.  
Pharmacokinetic Analysis: The pharmacokinetic analysis will be 
conducted on the pharmacokinetic analysis set. Plasma concentration-time data 
will be analyzed by non-compartmental methods, nonlinear mixed effects modeling, or by population-based anal ysis, based upon patient age and data 
suitability. Pharmacokinetic parameters will be calculated for each patient and summarized by age group, by dose (0.3, 1. 0, 3.0 mg/kg), and by time point, and 
by manufacturing scale, including the week 52 visit. 
Exploratory Efficacy Analysis:  An assessment of exploratory efficacy 
will be conducted on the modified intent-to-treat analysis set. Efficacy 
summaries will include descriptive statistics of the observed value and/or

 4 INTRODUCTION AND RATIONALE 
4.1 INTRODUCTION 
Human acid sphingomyelinase deficiency (ASMD)  is a serious, rare, and life-threatening 
lysosomal storage disorder for which only palliative treatment exists. Patients with ASMD are 
unable to metabolize sphingomyelin properly due to mutations in SMPD1 , the gene encoding acid 
sphingomyelinase,  whose transcription and transla tion results in a defective acid 
sphingomyelinase (ASM) enzyme. Inactivity of ASM leads to the lysosomal accumulation of sphingomyelin and, secondarily, increases in choles terol and other related lipids, mostly in the 
organs spleen, liver, lung, and bone marrow. 
Historically, ASMD has been diag nosed as Niemann-Pick Disease (N PD) and of either types A or 
B disease. Type A (NPD A) is characterized as  the early-onset and acute neuronopathic form of 
Niemann-Pick disease and results in failure to thrive, hepatosplenomegal y, rapidly progressive 
neurological degeneration, and death us ually before the age of 3 years ( 1). Niemann-Pick disease 
type B (NPD B) is a much milder disease with no or little neurological invol vement and is also a 
childhood disease. The most common disease manifestation is hepa tosplenomegaly; other, more 
variable features include liver dysfunction, pulm onary disease, retinal stigmata, and growth 
retardation. NPD B is usually diagnosed in ch ildhood after organomegaly is observed, typically 
after the age of 2 years. The majority of patients diagnosed with type B disease live into adulthood. Being an autosomal recessi ve single gene disease, ASMD  is acknowledged to generate 
a spectrum of phenotypes. Accordingly, cases classified as intermediate to the A and B extremes, have been reported. Patients with  this intermediate form (NPD  A/B) may develop neurologic 
symptoms during childhood and have a chronic neurodegenerative disease course. 
Genzyme is developing a potential enzyme th erapy for ASMD with recombinant human acid 
sphingomyelinase (rhASM; olipudase alfa) fo r the treatment of the non-neurological 
manifestations of ASMD. This recombinantly-derived enzyme is expressed in Chinese hamster 
ovarian cells transfected with olipudase alfa  complementary DNA that encodes a 627-residue 
peptide chain. The resulting gene-product retains the enzymatic activity and lysosomal targeting of the native protein. 
Proof of concept for olipudase alfa enzyme replac ement therapy has been demonstrated in the acid 
sphingomyelinase knock out (ASMKO) mouse model of ASMD (2), which exhibits both systemic 
and neurological features of ASMD. Repeat intrav enous bolus administration of olipudase alfa to 
ASMKO mice led to dose-dependent reductions of sphingomyelin in visceral organs and in the 
lungs, to a lesser extent, but was unable to prev ent neurologic decline and prolong survival ( 3, 4). 
Although chronic dosing in the ASMKO animal model is limited as the animal succumbs to the neurologic disease resulting from the natural progression of complete ASMD and subsequent 
shortened lifespan of appr oximately 6 to 8 months. 
Pharmacodynamic, pharmacokinetic , and toxicological studies conducted in the ASMKO mouse 
found significant reductions of sphingomyelin in the liver, lung, kidney, and spleen at olipudase 
alfa doses ranging from 0.1 to 5.0 mg/kg in a time dependent manner; however, toxicity was 
observed in ASMKO mice given single hi gh bolus doses of olipudase alfa ( ≥10 mg/kg). The same

 single high doses did not cause toxic effects in normal mice, Sprague Dawley rats, or cynomolgus 
monkeys, which suggested that catabolites of sphingomyelin, and not olipudase alfa itself, were the cause of the toxic effects. Subsequent “debulking” studies in ASMKO mice demonstrated that a slow reduction in the sphingomyelin load over time using multiple low doses of olipudase alfa 
(4 doses of 3.0 mg/kg olipudase alfa administere d over 8 days) followed by a high dose (20 mg/kg 
3 days later) prevented the toxicity associated with the single initial high doses. These findings suggest that the observed toxicity is related to th e rate of substrate degradation and that step-wise 
removal of substrate likely mitigates toxicity. Furthermore, repeat, high dos es of olipudase alfa 
(30 mg/kg every 2 weeks for 7 doses) administered after a 7-day debulking period (3 mg/kg on Days 1, 3, 5, and 7), also did not cause toxicity. 
In the completed Phase 1 study ( 5), the safety, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamic profiles of 
single, ascending doses of oli pudase alfa were evaluated ( 5). Single doses of 0.03, 0.1, 0.3, 0.6, 
and 1.0 mg/kg olipudase alfa were  infused sequentially by dose c ohort in 11 adult patients with 
ASMD. Study results found dose-related increases in ceramide, bilirubin, high sensitivity  
C-reactive protein (hsCRP), and ot her acute phase reactants in pa tients that peaked 24 to 48 hours 
post-dose and resolved by Day 14. Reported a dverse events (AEs) involving constitutional 
symptoms (pain, fever, nausea, and vomiting) were consistent with first dose-related toxicity and occurred in a dose dependent fashion, as was pr eviously observed in the ASMKO mouse. Serious 
AEs (SAEs) related to olipudase alfa treatment were not report ed. The sponsor terminated the 
study subsequent to the single patient dosed at 1.0 mg/kg olipudase alfa presenting with 
hyperbilirubinemia and an acute-phase reaction with clinical symptoms. Of note, this patient was 
subsequently confirmed to have Gilbert’s syndro me. Because there were no other signs of liver 
toxicity or hemolysis, the observed hyperbilirubinemia may have been secondary to specific 
inhibition of bilirubin uptake into hepatocytes and/or glucuronide conjugation of bilirubin within hepatocytes. 
In a Phase 1b, open-label, multi-center, ascending  dose study (DFI13412) in 5 adult patients with 
ASMD, the safety and tolerabilit y of olipudase alfa was evalua ted during a 26-week treatment 
period ( 6). Patients received an initial intravenous dose of 0.1 mg/kg olipudase alfa and then 
dose-escalated in a step wise manner to a final target intravenous  dose of 3.0 mg/kg. All patients 
remained 3.0 mg/kg for the remainder of the treat ment period. Upon completion of the study, all 
patients enrolled into an open-label, long term tr eatment study (LTS13632) ( 7).  
Results from this trial demonstrated that the progressive, within-patie nt olipudase alfa dose 
escalation regimen was well tolerated in adult ASMD patients. No serious or severe AEs or deaths 
were reported in the study. Relate d AEs consisted predominantly of  infusion-associated reactions 
(IARs), the majority of which were  mild in severity with  all patients recovering without sequelae. 
At the end of the 6 month treatment period, a pos itive response to treatment  with olipudase alfa 
was observed in several individual efficacy parameters. This incl uded mean decreases in spleen 
and liver volumes by 25.3% and 17.1%, respectivel y; decreased interstitial lung disease scores; 
increased percent predicted  DL
CO; reduction in serum chitotriosidase, chemokine (CC-motif) 
ligand 18 (CCL18) and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE); a positive trend towards a less 
pro-atherogenic lipid profile; and trends for impr ovement in quality of life assessments for fatigue 
and pain.  
A complete summary of nonclinical  and clinical experience with olipudase alfa can be found in 
the Investigator’s brochure.

 4.2 STUDY RATIONALE 
The sponsor believes that cumulative data from the single-dose Phase 1 study ( 5) and repeat-dose 
Phase 1b study ( 6) demonstrate both the safety and tolerability of the olipudase alfa dose 
escalation regimen and repeat dosing at 3.0 mg/k g; such data support the conduction of this 
repeat, ascending dose study of olipudase alfa in pediatric patients with ASMD.  
This Phase 1/2, open-label, multi-center, multi-national study is designed to evaluate the safety 
and tolerability of olipudase alfa in pediatric patients less than 18 years of age with  non-neuronopathic ASMD. Olipuda se alfa will be administered every 2 weeks using a 
progressive, within-patient dos e escalation regimen, with dose escalation starting at 0.03 mg/kg 
and ending at 3.0 mg/kg. This study was al so designed to characterize olipudase alfa 
pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and exploratory efficacy throughout a 64-week treatment 
period.

 6 STUDY DESIGN 
6.1 DESCRIPTION OF THE PROTOCOL 
DFI13803 is a Phase 1/2, multi-center, open-label, ascending dose study to evaluate the safety, 
tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and explorator y efficacy of olipudase alfa 
administered once every 2 weeks for 64 weeks in pe diatric patients less than 18 years of age with 
non-neuronopathic ASMD. At least 12 patients will be enrolled in a staggered fashion into 3 age 
cohorts, with a minimum of 3 patients aged from 12 to <18 years (adoles cent cohort), 3 patients 
aged from 6 to <12 years (child cohort), and 2 patients with ages  ranging from birth to <6 years 
(infant/early child cohort).  
In this study, intravenous infusions of olipuda se alfa will be administered every 2 weeks for 
64 weeks. Patients will begin with a dose of 0.03 mg/kg olipudase alfa, which will be followed 
with dose escalation to 0.1mg/kg and then to 0.3 mg /kg olipudase alfa. Patients able to tolerate 
2 consecutive doses of 0.3 mg/kg olipudase alfa  will continue to dose escalate step-wise as 
indicated in Section  1.1 to 0.6 mg/kg, 1.0 mg/kg, 2.0 mg/kg, and the final target dose of 3.0 mg/kg 
olipudase alfa. Patients un able to tolerate 2 consecutive doses  of 0.3 mg/kg olipudase alfa will be 
replaced. Patients unable to to lerate the target 3.0 mg/kg dose will receive the highest dose 
tolerable every 2 weeks for the remainder of the 64-week treatment period.  Patient enrollment and in itiation of dosing will be staggered among the three pediatric age cohorts 
for the first 12 patients. The study will begin with the enrollment of patients from the adolescent 
cohort (ages 12 to less than 18 years). Subsequently, a Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) and the sponsor will review all safety data collected from the first 3 patients in the adolescent cohort 
who have completed the dose escalation phase, reflec ting the most critical point in olipudase alfa 
safety. Pending the outcome of the DMC and sponsor review, patients from the child cohort (6 to less than 12 years) will be enrolled. When the first 3 patients in the child cohort complete the dose escalation phase, another DMC and sponsor review  will be conducte d. Pending the outcome of the 
DMC and sponsor review of safety data from the child cohort, the study will be opened for enrollment of the infant/early child cohort (patients younger than 6 years of age).  
To open enrollment in younger age cohorts, the sponsor and DMC will review at a minimum the 
following safety data: AEs/trea tment emergent AEs (TEAEs) incl uding IARs, clinical laboratory 
results including but not limited to hematology and clinical chemistry, electrocardiograms (ECGs), vitals, and any available immunology results as applicable. 
Following enrollment in the youngest age cohort,  an additional group of at least 8 patients <12 
years will be enrolled.  These pa tients will be included in the a ppropriate age cohort (at least 4 
patients in the child cohort and at least 2 patie nts in the infant/early child cohort) without 
staggering of enrollment/ treatment.

 Eligible patients may enroll in a long-term st udy (LTS13632) following completion the 64-week 
treatment period to continue re ceiving olipudase alfa. Patients not enrolling in the long-term 
study, or those with a treatment gap betwee n the end of the 64-week treatment period of 
DFI13803 and enrollment in the long-term study, will undergo a final safe ty follow-up assessment 
by telephone 30 to 37 days after the last infusion in this study. 
6.2 DURATION OF STUDY PARTICIPATION 
6.2.1 Duration of study participation for each patient 
Per patient, the maximum study dura tion is approximately 18 months: 
• Screening period: up to 60 days 
• Treatment period: 64 weeks 
• Post-treatment period: up to 37 days, which is not applicable if patient enrolls in 
LTS13632 
6.2.2 Determination of end of clinical study (all patients)  
The end of the clinical study is defined as the day that the last patient completes his/her last visit 
at the end of the treatment peri od as planned in the protocol.  
6.3 STUDY COMMITTEES 
An independent DMC appointed by the sponsor will review the protocol and will thereafter 
provide medical and ethical guidance related to the conduct of this study. The DMC will review 
safety information as outlined in the DMC Charter, which is maintained separately from the study protocol.  
A formal safety review will be performed by the DMC:  
• When 3 patients in the adolescent cohor t complete the dose escalation phase.  
• Approximately every 12 weeks after the first DMC meeting until study end. Frequency 
can be adapted based on availability of patient data and key visits. 
• When 3 patients in the child cohort co mplete the dose escalation phase.  
• With all relevant data at  the end of the study. 
Relevant data for DMC reviews will be, at a minimum, AEs including IARs, clinical laboratory results including, but not limited to, hematology and clinical chemistry, ECG, vitals, and any available immunology results as applicable. 
The DMC will also review data on an ad hoc basis to assist in determining if AEs should preclude 
continued treatment with olipudase alfa and if stopping rules apply. The report of a potential dose

 the DLT sponsor's medical monitor or global sa fety officer that pose a medical concern, for 
example a fatal event, will result in the DMC holdi ng an ad hoc review of the safety data and 
providing its recommendations to the sponsor regarding further patient treatment. Should any 
major safety issues arise, final decisions regarding the study will be made by the sponsor, taking 
into consideration the DM C opinion (as applicable). 
6.4 DISCUSSION OF STUDY DESIGN AND CHOICE OF CONTROL GROUPS 
The following points were taken into consid eration in the design of the study:  
Rationale for dose selection and escalation: The starting dose of 0.03 mg/kg in this pediatric 
clinical trial is 10 times below the no observable adverse effect level (NOAEL) in single dose studies in ASMKO mice, and 1000 times below the NOAEL in repeat dose studies in ASMKO 
mice following a sphingomyelin debulking regimen. In addition, the starting dose of 0.03 mg/kg is 3 times lower than the highest dose that was not associated with any related AEs in the Phase 1 single-dose study, 0.1 mg/kg ( 5).  
The target dose of 3.0 mg/kg olipudase alfa was se lected to evaluate a dose effect for olipudase 
alfa to clear sphingomyelin from the lungs in  patients with ASMD. In nonclinical studies, 
treatment of ASMKO mice with olipudase alfa led to dose depende nt reductions of sphingomyelin 
in tissues, with the liver and spleen clearing substantially more substrate than the lung, suggesting the need for a higher dose and/or longer treatment  duration to effectively treat the lung. As noted 
previously, chronic dosing in the ASMKO animal model is limited by the animal’s shortened 
lifespan of approximately 6 to 8 months, a direct consequence of complete ASMD. 
The highest repeat-dose for this study, 3.0 mg /kg, is supported by nonclinical repeat-dose 
toxicology data and experience from the adult Phase 1b trial. This dose is 10 times less than the 
30 mg/kg repeat dose NOAEL in ASMKO mice af ter a debulking regimen, and is 3.3 times less 
than the 10 mg/kg single dose, at which signifi cant toxicity and deaths were observed in ASMKO 
mice without prior debulking. In the Phase 1b study,  the safety and tolerability of within-patient 
dose escalation of olipudase alfa administered intravenously every two weeks for 26 weeks was studied. In this trial, 5 adult patients with NPD B were given as cending doses of olipudase alfa 
administered intravenously every two weeks, as tolerated, according to the following dose escalation schedule: 0.1, 0.3, 0.3, 0.6, 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0 mg/kg. The olipudase alfa dose was 
increased if the patient experienced no or only mild AEs at the lower dose. Patients were monitored in-hospital prior to and for at least 72 hours after olipudase alfa infusion during the 
dose escalation period, and during the first 2 doses at the maximum tolerable dose; thereafter patients were maintained at their maximum tolerable dose until the end of the 26-week treatment period and discharged after dosing and a 3-hour minimum observational period. Study 
assessments included continuous AE reportin g and periodic evaluations of safety, 
pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics,  and efficacy parameters.  
All 5 patients completed the dose escalation regimen, receiving 3.0 mg/kg olipudase alfa, the highest dose allowed per protocol, and remained at that dose for the remainder of the study. Three 
patients completed the dose escal ation regimen without a dose reduction or repeat. One patient 
had a dose reduction following a moderate IAR with the first olipudase alfa dose at 1.0 mg/kg;

 subsequently, this patient continued dose escalation to 2.0 a nd 3.0 mg/kg olipudase alfa. One 
patient repeated the 2.0 mg/kg olipudase alfa dos e following a moderate IAR and subsequently 
dose escalated to 3.0 mg/kg. Adverse events were mild or moderate with t hose considered related 
to olipudase alfa administrati on generally occurring between 12 and 48 hours post-dose. The most 
commonly reported of these events were headach e, arthralgia, abdominal pain, and nausea. 
Plasma ceramide levels typically peaked 48 hours  post-dose and attenuated with repeat dosing. 
The dose of 3.0 mg/kg will only be administered once a patient has safely escalated through the 
lower doses following the progressive dose esca lation regimen. By comparison, the same dose of 
olipudase alfa that caused toxic effects in ASM KO mice (ie, 10 mg/kg), did not cause toxic effects 
in normal mice, Sprague Dawley rats, or cynomolgus monkeys, suggesting that a sphingomyelin catabolite (eg, ceramide, sphingosine, sphingosine-1-phosphate, or  phosphocholine) was 
responsible for the toxic effects,  and not olipudase alfa itself. 
Open label, no placebo control: Given that the primary purpose of the study is to understand the 
safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and exploratory efficacy of repeat 
olipudase alfa dosing in pediatri c patients with ASMD, the study is designed as an open-label, no 
comparator group trial. 
Inclusion of infant/early child ASMD patients:  Given the rarity of ASMD and that patients with 
the non-neuronopathic form of the di sease can be diagnosed as early as birth, the age for the study 
includes patients from birth to <18 years of age.  Sixty-four week treatment period:  The 64-week treatment period will allow for a broader 
understanding of olipudase alfa safety and tolerability in a patient population rapidly changing 
physiologically relative to shorter studies. Depending on the assessment, change from baseline in 
exploratory efficacy parameters will be evaluated through 52 weeks or 64 weeks of olipudase alfa administration. In addition, long te rm olipudase alfa safety and to lerability will also be further 
explored via the extension study LTS13632.  
Patient enrollment between age cohorts:  Enrollment of patients in DFI13803 for the first 12 
patients will begin with adolescent patients (ages 12 to less than 18 years), followed by enrollment 
of child patients (6 to less than 12 years) and ending with the enrollment of infant/early child patients (patients below 6 year s of age) as described in Section  6.1. The most critical phase for 
olipudase alfa safety is the dose escalation phase as indicated by Phase 1b study data ( 6). For this 
reason, enrollment of child cohort patients will commence once 3 patie nts in the adolescent cohort 
complete the dose escalation phase, and resulting safety data reviewed by the DMC and sponsor. The same process will occur with the enrollme nt of infant/early child patients based upon 
complete dose escalation safety data from 3 child cohor t patients. Following enrollment in the 
youngest age cohort, an additional group of at l east 8 patients <12 years will be enrolled.  These 
patients will be included in th e appropriate age cohort without  staggering of enrollment/ 
treatment. 
Number of patients:  A sample size power calculation wa s not performed for this study. The 
sample size approximation of 20 pediatric patients is ba sed upon empirical considerations. 
At least 12 patients will be enrolled in a staggered fashion to 3 age cohorts with a minimum of 3 
patients aged from 12 to <18 years, 3 patients aged  from 6 to <12 years, and 2 patients with ages

 ranging from birth to <6 years; followed by at  least 8 additional patie nts <12 years enrolled 
without staggering. Out of the 8 additional patients,  at least 4 patients in the child cohort and at 
least 2 patients in the infant/early child cohort will be enrolled. 
Number of investigator sites:  In order to fully enroll the study, this will be a multi-center, 
multi-national trial. ASMD is an orphan disease with a limited number of patients available to 
participate in clinical trials. Multiple sites will allow for the inclusion of patients from multiple regions. 
6.4.1 Specific parameters rationale 
6.4.1.1 Safety 
Data collected in the phase 1 single ascending dose study with olipudase alfa in ASMD adult 
patients demonstrated dose-related increases in ceramide, bilirubin, hsCRP, and other acute phase 
reactants that peaked 24 to 48 hours post-dose and resolved by Day 14 ( 5). With the use of a 
progressive dose escalation regimen in the Phas e 1b adult ASMD, such increases in ceramide, 
bilirubin, hsCPR and other acute phase reactants were attenuated, with the majority of AEs being 
mild ( 6).  
As a result, safety biomarkers for the monitoring  of olipudase alfa in pediatric patients include, 
but are not limited to, hsCRP, ceramide, iron, fe rritin, cardiac-specific tr oponin I, calcitonin, 
interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-8. 
An immune reaction against an exogenously administ ered recombinant protein plays a critical role 
in the safety of such compounds. Therefore, sa fety assessments will al so include blood samples 
for anti-olipudase alfa immunoglobulin G (IgG) an tibodies and neutralizing antibody formation in 
patients testing positive for IgG.  In the event that a patient experiences a moderate, severe, or recurrent IAR suggestive of 
hypersensitivity reactions, additional blood samp les will be collected for the evaluation of: 
• circulating immune comp lex detection; and 
• immunoglobulin E (IgE), serum tryp tase, and comple ment activation. 
Additionally, skin testing may be performed, as appropriate, in  patients who experience an IAR 
that meets the following criteria: 
• Infusion associated reaction is suggestive of IgE-mediated hypersensitivity reaction, with 
persistent symptoms of bronchospasm, hypotension  and/or urticaria requi ring intervention;  
• or any other signs or symptoms at the disc retion of the investigator or the sponsor. 
Skin testing may be another predictor of Ig E-mediated reaction and may be suggested for 
confirmation of the IgE results.

 6.4.1.2 Exploratory efficacy 
Exploratory efficacy of olipudase alfa in pediat ric patients will be assesse d by evaluating changes 
in organomegaly, lung function and pulmonary imagi ng parameters, exercise testing, lipid profile, 
bone biomarkers, linear growth, and biomarkers know n to be elevated in ASMD. Such biomarkers 
include chitotriosidase, CCL18, and ACE ( 8). Several of the above assessments have been 
identified as potential indicators of clinical outcome in ASMD ( 9). 
Levels of the olipudase alfa enzymatic substr ate sphingomyelin and sphingomyelin metabolites 
will also be evaluated throughout the treatment period in plasma and/or dried blood spots.  
Changes in quality of life, fatigue and pain levels will be evaluated using age- appropriate scales, 
including the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL), the PedsQL Multidimensional Fatigue 
Scale and the PedsQL Pediatric Pain Questi onnaire. Changes in cognitive function will be 
evaluated in ASMD patients younger than 6 ye ars with the Developm ent Profile-3 (DP-3) 
assessment tool.  Changes in adaptive function wi ll be evaluated in AS MD patients less than 
6 years using the Adaptive Behavior Assessment System (ABAS).

 8 STUDY TREATMENTS 
8.1 INVESTIGATIONAL MEDICINAL PRODUCT(S) 
The study drug, olipudase alfa, is a sterile, non-pyrogenic white to off-white lyophilized cake 
supplied in single-use, 20 cc Type 1 glass vials. Ea ch vial contains 20 mg of extractable olipudase 
alfa. 
8.2 NONINVESTIGATIONAL MEDICINAL PRODUCTS 
Not applicable. 
8.3 PREPARATION AND ADMINISTRATION OF TREATMENTS 
8.3.1 Investigational medicinal product preparation  
Detailed information on preparati on and administration of olipuda se alfa is provided in the 
pharmacy manual. 
Study drug or investigational me dicinal product (IMP) infusions mu st be prepared by a qualified, 
authorized pharmacist (or designee) using aseptic technique. The pharmacist or designee will 
determine the quantity of vials required based on the patient’s weight a nd dose. Olipudase alfa 
doses should be adjusted every 4 weeks to account for patient growth.  
The study drug will be reconstituted with 5.1 mL  of Sterile Water for Injection to yield a 
concentration of 4.0 mg/mL olipudase alfa. The stud y drug will be further diluted in 0.9% sodium 
chloride for injection solution to  a specific volume based on dose. 
All infusions will be prepared based on patient weight (kg) and dose (ranging from 0.03 mg/kg to 
3.0 mg/kg). Therefore, the total volume of the infu sion will be dependent on  the patient's weight 
and total dose, as recommende d in the pharmacy manual.  
The diluted solution should be filtered through a 0.2 – 0.22 micron, low protein-binding, in-line 
filter during administration to remove any visible particles. 
Olipudase alfa should not be infused in th e same intravenous line with other products.

 8.3.2 Investigational medicinal product administration 
For all dose levels, dosing with olipudase alfa is by intravenous infusion every 2 weeks (±3 days). 
The dose escalation phase and the 64-week treatme nt period begin with the first intravenous 
infusion of 0.03 mg/kg olipudase alfa on Day 1/Week 0 ( Section 1.1 ). All subsequent olipudase 
alfa administrations are to be scheduled relative to the Day 1/Week 0 visit. The dose escalation 
phase ends with the first infusion at 3.0 mg/kg or  with the identification of a patient-specific 
highest tolerated dose.  
Patients who tolerate the 0.03 mg/kg dose at Day 1/Week 0 (one re-challenge of the 0.03 mg/kg 
dose is allowed) will receive a dose of 0.1 mg/k g 2 weeks later. Patie nts who tolerate the 
0.1 mg/kg dose (one re-challenge of the first 0.1 mg/kg dose is allowed) will receive a dose of 
0.3 mg/kg dose 2 weeks later. Patients tolerating 2 consecutive doses of 0.3 mg/kg will be dose 
escalated step-wise to receive 2 consecutive doses at 0.6 mg/kg, followed by infusions at 
1.0 mg/kg and 2.0 mg/kg, and to the final target dos e of 3.0 mg/kg, which is maintained for the 
remaining duration of th e treatment period. Patient s unable to tolerate 3.0 mg/kg olipudase alfa 
will receive the highest tolerable dose every 2 we eks until the end of the treatment period. (Refer 
to Section  8.3.4.2.1 for patient stopping criteria.) 
Decisions regarding dose escalations may be made by discussion between the investigator and the 
sponsor upon review on an indi vidual patient basis. See Section  8.3.4 for dose escalation criteria.  
All infusions will take place in a monitored settin g with ready access to emergency resuscitation 
equipment and medications.  
Patients will receive intr avenous olipudase alfa over a period of approximately 20 minutes to 
4.5 hours, depending on the dose. The length of the infusion time may be adjusted based on the 
patient’s tolerance of the infusion. Infusions should be administered at approximate ly the same time of the day. There are no 
restrictions on the infusion timing with respect to meals.  
8.3.3 Infusion delays or missed infusions  
During the treatment period, patients are infused w ith olipudase alfa every 2 weeks (±3 days) with 
all olipudase alfa infusions sche duled relative to the first study infusion on Day 1/Week 0. If any 
olipudase alfa infusion is delayed by more th an 3 days, the infusion is considered a missed 
infusion. Missed infusions should not be administere d. The patient should return to the clinic for 
their next scheduled visit and receive their last pr eviously tolerated dose leve l of olipudase alfa. If 
more than 1 infusion is missed during dose escalati on, the next dose will be decreased by 1 level. 
If more than 1 infusion is missed after the patient has completed dose escalation, the last 
previously tolerated dose level of olipudase alfa may be ad ministered or the dose may be 
decreased by 1 level at the investigator’s discretion.

 8.3.4 Escalation schema including dose-limiting toxicity criteria and maximally tolerated 
dose determination 
8.3.4.1 Dose escalation schema 
During dose escalation, patients will undergo in-patient hospitalization as indicated in 
Section  10.3.1. The following criteria will determine th e next dose of olipudase alfa to be 
administered, provided the patient  does not experience an AE th at meets the patient stopping 
criteria (see Section  8.3.4.2.1). Only AEs not related to the patient’s underlying condition will 
affect dose escalation. These criteria apply to AEs considered relate d to study treatment. 
1. If the patient experiences no AE or a mild AE , escalate to the next dose. 
2. If the patient experiences a moderate AE , repeat the same dose. Note:  Re-challenge for 
patients with a moderate AE at a dose of 0.03 or 0.1 mg/kg olipuda se alfa is permitted 
only once before the patient is discontinued from the study and replaced.  
3. If the patient experiences a severe AE , decrease to the prior dose. Note:  Patients with a 
severe AE at a dose of 0.03 mg/kg or 0.1 mg /kg olipudase alfa w ill be discontinued from 
the study and replaced. Re- challenge for patie nts with a severe AE at a dose of 0.3 mg/kg 
olipudase alfa is permitted only once (at the lo wer dose of 0.1 mg/kg) before the patient is 
discontinued and replaced. 
If a patient presents on the day of infusion either with an unresolved AE or an acute illness, neither of which meets the patient stopping criteria ( Section  8.3.4.2.1), the olipudase alfa infusion 
may be withheld or administered at the discreti on of the investigator. If it is not possible to 
administer a regularly scheduled infusion with in the 3-day window allowed per protocol, 
see Section  8.3.3.  
8.3.4.2 Dose-limiting toxicity criteria 
For the purpose of this study, the even ts listed under patient stopping criteria 
(see Section  8.3.4.2.1) are considered indicative of a potentia l DLT  for olipudase alfa at a given 
dose. If a potential DLT is observed, dosing will be temporarily stopped in an  individual patient or 
in the entire study, and the DMC will review the safety data. The DMC will then provide recommendation(s) to the sponsor re garding further patient treatment ( Section 6.3 ). Screening for 
eligible patients may continue  during DMC review of patient or study stopping events. 
When olipudase alfa dosing is tem porarily halted for a particular pa tient, safety monitoring of the 
patient will continue. If the AE(s) is/are reversible and the clinical laboratory tests (including liver function tests) have reached pre-event levels, the patient will resume dosing and receive the previously-tolerated lower dose. Depending on th e patient's response, dos e escalation will either 
continue (as described in Section  8.3.4.1) or the patient will remain at the previously tolerated 
dose (ie, the patient’s highest tolerated dose [HTD]). 
The investigator is responsible for notifying his/her Institutional Review Board/Independent 
Ethics Committee (IRB/IEC) in writing when a potential DLT is being evaluated at his/her investigative site.

 8.3.4.2.1 Dose limiting toxicity patient stopping criteria 
If any of the following AEs occur, dosing will be  temporarily stopped for the specific patient who 
experienced the AE:  
• Any SAE, not related to the patient’s underlyi ng condition and considered related to the 
study treatment. 
• Any increase in aspartate aminotransferase (A ST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), total 
bilirubin, or alkaline phosphatase (AP) >3x baseline (prior to olipudase alfa therapy) and 
>  the upper limit of normal (ULN). 
• Any increase in total bilirubin or AP >1.5x baseline, in the presence of AST or ALT >2x 
ULN. 
•   Any increase in ALT or AST >3x the ULN combined with an increase in ALT or AST >2x baseline (prior to olipudase alfa therapy)  with symptoms of fatigue, nausea, vomiting, 
fever, rash, or eosinophilia (>ULN). 
• Any AE that, in the opinion of the investigat or or sponsor, raises significant concern 
regarding the safety of olipudase alfa at the administered dose. 
8.3.4.2.2 Study stopping criteria 
If either of these criteria are met: 
• Two patients develop the same severe AE that is not re lated to their underlying condition, 
or 
• A death occurs that is assessed as relate d or possibly related to olipudase alfa,  
an ad hoc DMC meeting will be held to review the safety data and provide its recommendations to the sponsor regarding further patient treatment.  
After consideration of DMC reco mmendations, final decisions rega rding discontinuation of study 
drug for all or selected clinical tria l patients will be ma de by the Sponsor. 
In the event a significant safety concern ar ises, the Sponsor may immediately decide to 
discontinue study drug dosing in all clinical trial patients prior to receipt of DMC 
recommendation. 
If the study is temporarily or permanently halte d, the Sponsor will notify the health authorities of 
the halt by a substantial amendment in regions where this applies.

 8.8.1 Treatment accountability and compliance 
Compliance to the treatment regimen will be monitored in terms of the percentage of scheduled 
infusions the patient receives through the tr eatment period. No infusions should be missed. 
Noncompliance is defined as missing 2 consecutiv e infusions (not for cause, such as when the 
missed infusions are required by the protocol due to a DLT) or 4 total infusions per the 64-week treatment period. As they are id entified, the investigator should discuss noncompliant patients on 
a case by case basis with the sponsor.  
The investigator or designee will keep an accura te record of all study drug received, dispensed, 
and returned on a per patient basis using a study drug or IMP accountability log. 
8.8.2 Return and/or destruction of treatments 
Reconciliation of all used, partially-used or unused treatments must be performed at the site by the 
investigator and the monitoring team using treatment log forms. Authorization for destruction will be given by  the sponsor once the reconciliation has been 
completed. This destruction can be performed at the site depending on loca l regulations and site 
specific capabilities; alternatively,  study drug may be returned to the sponsor or designee for 
destruction. 
8.9 CONCOMITANT MEDICATION 
Medications and therapeutic procedures received by the patient in the 30 days prior to their first 
infusion until the final visit will be recorded on the Prior and Concomitant Medication electronic 
case report form (e-CRF) as appropriate. 
Prior and concomitant medicati ons will be coded according to the World Health Organization 
Drug Dictionary. 
• Prior medications will be defined as medications that are taken 30 days prior to the first 
infusion of olipudase alfa in this study. 
• Concomitant medications will be defined as medications that are taken after the first infusion of olipudase alfa in this study. 
During the study, prohibited medications include those that may decrease olipudase alfa activity 
(eg, fluoxetine, chlorpromazine; tricyclic antidepressants [eg, imipramine, or desipramine]). See the study manual for a list of concomitant medicati ons that may decrease olipudase alfa activity. 
Cationic amphiphilic antihistamines, such as loratadine, desloratadine, astemizole, ebastine, 
terfenadine, and clemastine, may decr ease olipudase alfa activity. Therefore, the need for their use 
in oral or IV administration should be carefully  considered. There is no restriction on topical 
antihistaminics.  
Pretreatment in general is not  recommended for prophylactic mana gement of IARs. For patients 
who experience moderate to severe or recurrent IARs suggestive of hypersensitivity (as defined in

 Section  10.6.1.3.2.1), pre-treatment regimens (eg, antihistamines, antipyretics, glucocorticoids) 
may be prescribed by the investigator as per clini cal judgment.  In particular, the need for cationic 
amphiphilic antihistamines administered orally or IV should be carefully considered given the 
potential risk for functional inhibition of olipudase alfa activity by such drugs. 
8.9.1 Treatment of infusion-associated reactions  
For management of mild IARs, infusion rate reductions (eg, reduced to half the rate) or temporary 
interruptions may mitigate the reaction. For moderate to severe or recurrent IARs, the investigator may consider the use of pre-treatment medications (eg, antihistamines, antipyretics, and/or glucocorticoids), if the symptoms are suggestiv e of hypersensitivity reaction, in addition to 
infusion rate reductions, interrup tions, or discontinuation.  In pa rticular, the need for cationic 
amphiphilic antihistamines administered orally or IV should be carefully considered given the 
potential risk for functional inhibition of olipudase alfa activity by such drugs. 
Patients experiencing symptoms suggestive of hy persensitivity reactions, including anaphylactic 
or anaphylactoid reactions, during olipudase alfa  infusion should be managed according to the 
general standards of care consistent with the treat ment of such reactions. If anaphylaxis or other 
severe allergic reactions occu r, immediate discontinuation of th e infusion should be considered, 
and appropriate medical treatment should be initia ted. Because of the potential for severe IARs, 
appropriate medical personnel and e quipment to perform resuscitation must be readily available in 
the event of a hypersensitivity reaction.

 9 ASSESSMENT OF INVESTIGATIONAL MEDICINAL PRODUCT 
9.1 PRIMARY ENDPOINT - SAFETY 
Primary safety endpoints in clude data pertaining to the safety and tolerability of  olipudase alfa: 
assessment of AEs/TEAEs, including IARs; physi cal examinations; neurological examinations; 
clinical laboratory evaluations; vital sign m easurements; ECGs; safety biomarkers; Doppler 
echocardiography and liver ultrasound Doppl er; and immune response assessments.  
A site physician will assess safe ty findings as normal, abnormal but not clinically significant 
(NCS), or abnormal and clinically significant (CS). Any abnormal findings that meet the 
definition of an AE per Section 10.6  will be recorded on the AE e-CRF. 
9.1.1 Physical examination 
Complete physical examinations will be completed as indicated in Section 1.2  and will include the 
following observations/measurements: general app earance, examination of the skin; head, eyes, 
ears, nose, and throat; lymph nodes; heart, lung s, and abdomen; extremitie s and joints and body 
mass index. The patient’s weight will be measured without shoes and wearing the lightest possible 
clothing. At visits where height is measured, th e patient will be measured  without shoes. While 
patient height is included as part of the physical examination, z-score for height will be evaluated 
as an exploratory efficacy parameter.  
An abbreviated physical examination will assess only the general appearance of the patient and is 
only required when a complete exam is not indicated. 
Whenever possible, the same physician should pe rform the physical examination at all study 
visits.  
9.1.2 Neurological Examination 
Neurological examinations will be performed as specified in Section 1.2 . Assessments include, 
but are not limited to the patient’s mental status, posture, cranial nerves, motor system including 
muscle atrophy, tone and power, reflexes, sensor y system, coordination, ga it, and age-appropriate 
responses. The examination should be performed by  the same neurologist throughout the study, 
if possible.

 9.1.3.1 Infusion associated reactions  
For a moderate/severe or recurrent IAR that is suggestive of a hypersensitivity reaction (as 
defined in Section  10.6.1.3.2.1), additional blood sample s will be collected and sent to the sponsor 
for anti olipudase alfa antibody (IgG and IgE), tryptase activity, and complement activation 
testing as described below. Skin testing may also be performed if clinically indicated. 
• For IgE anti-olipudase alfa antibody testing th e same pre-infusion serum sample drawn for 
anti-olipudase alfa IgG testing (every 4 weeks) may be used if the IAR occurs at that study 
visit. If a pre-infusion sample was not drawn on that day, the patient should return to the study site or local laboratory at least 3 days after the event for a serum sample to be drawn. 
Testing is conducted for research purposes to gain additional informa tion as to individual 
patients’ responses to study trea tment and for aiding in the c linical management of patient 
safety. 
• Blood samples will be drawn within 1 to 3 hour s of an IAR for serum tryptase activity 
testing (serum) and complement activation testing (plasma), when clinically indicated. 
• Refer to the study manual for guidelines on the collection and shipping of samples.  
• Skin testing may be performed if necessary following consultation between the investigator and the sponsor in patients who experience an IAR that meet the following 
criteria: 
- Assessed as moderate or seve re in intensity, or recurrent, by the investigator AND. 
- Suggestive of an IgE-mediated hypersensitivity reaction (ie, persistent and intractable 
symptoms of hypersensitivity [as described in Section  10.6.1.3.2.1] as assessed by the 
investigator). 
Refer to the study manual for skin testing procedures. 
9.1.4 Vital signs 
Vital signs will be evaluated as indicated in Section 1.2 . More specifically, vitals are to be 
measured at every visit before, halfway throug h, and after infusion (±10 minutes). Postinfusion 
vital signs are measured every 30 minutes fo r the first 2 hours, hourly for 2 to 6 hours 
postinfusion, and then once every 8 hours until the patient is discharged (±10 minutes). Vital signs will include heart rate (HR, beats/minute), syst olic and diastolic blood pressure (mmHg), and 
body temperature (°F or °C).  
9.1.5 Electrocardiograms 
Standard 12-lead ECGs will be recorded using an electrocardiographic device at the visits and timepoints specified in Section 1.2  and Section  1.3 after at least 5 minutes in supine position, and 
prior to any blood collections.  
For Day 1/Week 0, triplicate ECG (3 ECGs) will be recorded within 5 minutes with at least 
1 minute between 2 replicates prior to IMP administration.

Property of the Sanofi Group- strictly confidential Page 46 
 Each ECG consists of a 10-second recording of the 12 leads simultaneously, leading to: 
• A single 12-lead ECG (25 mm/s, 10 mm/mV) printout with heart rate, PR, QRS, QT, QTc 
automatic correction evaluation, including date, time, initials, and patient number 
(ie, 9 digits) , signature of the research physician, and at least 3 complexes for each lead. 
This printout will be retained at the site. 
• A digital storage that enables eventual further reading by an ECG reading center: each 
digital file will be identified by theoretical day and time, real date and real time (recorder time), sponsor study code, patient number (ie, 3 digits), date of birth, and site and country 
numbers, if relevant. The digital recording,  data storage, and transmission (whenever 
requested) need to comply with all applicable regulatory requirements (ie, FDA 21 CFR, part 11).  
The study site cardiologist should review the ECGs  in a timely manner to determine if there are 
any safety concerns and for clinical management of the patient. In the event of any CS or NCS 
abnormal findings that meet th e definition of an AE (see Section  10.6 for definitions and 
reporting), the investigator will continue to monitor the patient with additional ECGs until the ECG returns to baseline or the investigator dete rmines that follow-up is no longer necessary. The 
investigator’s or cardiologist’s assessments are to be captured in the e-CRF. 
All ECGs will also be collected and read centrally by a third party independent reviewer. 
9.1.6 Doppler echocardiogram 
A 2-dimensional and M-mode ec hocardiograph with Doppler will be performed at the visits 
specified in Section 1.2 .  
Examination will include but not be limited to: left ventricular cavity size, left ventricular mass, 
valve characterization, ejection fra ction, ventricular wall thickness,  regional wall motion, systolic 
and diastolic functions, pericardium characterization and congenital abnormalities. Pulmonary artery pressure will be dete rmined by Doppler ultrasound. 
The review of these assessments will be performed locally by a certified cardiologist.  Whenever possible, the same cardiologist will perform all evaluations per patient.   
Wherever possible, the same physician should re view all echocardiographs for a given patient.  
9.1.7 Liver ultrasound Doppler 
Liver ultrasound Doppler will be performed as specified in Section 1.2  to document hepatic blood 
flow characteristics, principally portal vein pre ssure, and blood flow direction. The structures to 
be examined include hepatic por tal vein, the main hepatic artery and the main hepatic vein. 
Additional structures that may be examined include the network of intrahepatic portal veins, the 
main and intrahepatic arteries, the hepatic veins, the main and intrahepatic portal veins, the 
intrahepatic portion of the inferior vena cava,  collateral venous pathwa ys, and transjugular 
intrahepatic portosystemic shunts. Liver ultrasound Doppler will be perfor med using methods that 
are compatible with the standard institutional procedures of the investigational site.

 9.1.8 Clinical laboratory evaluations 
The following hematology, chemistry, serology and urine analyses will be evaluated as indicated 
in Section 1.2 , Section  1.3 and Section  1.4. 
• Hematology: complete blood count  includi ng white blood cell count, platelet count, 
hemoglobin, and hematocrit with absolute a nd percentage differential cell counts of 
lymphocytes, monocytes, neutrophils, basophils , eosinophils, and (if applicable) abnormal 
cells. 
• Clinical chemistry: sodium, potassium, chlori de, blood urea nitrogen, glucose, uric acid, 
calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, albumin, total protein, creatinine, AST, ALT, total 
bilirubin, direct bilirubin, AP. 
• Coagulation: prothrombin time (Protime), pa rtial thromboplastin time (PTT), INR, and  
D-dimer. 
• Serology tests: hepatitis B antigen, hepa titis C antibodies, anti-human immunodeficiency 
virus-1 and anti-human immunodeficiency virus-2 antibodies. 
• Urinalysis: dipstick for pH, ketones, glucose, bilirubin, protein and blood.  
• If female of child bearing potential, β-hCG serum or urine test as appropriate per 
Section 1.2  and Section  10.3. 
Analysis of all safety laboratory  parameters will be c onducted by a central la boratory. Procedures 
for handling and shipment of all central laboratory samples will be included in the information provided by the central laboratory. Specimens w ill be processed approp riately by the central 
laboratory facility and laboratory reports will be made available to the study investigator in a 
timely manner to assure appropriate clinical review. 
Clinical laboratory values will be analyzed after conversion into standard international units. 
International units will be used in all listings and tables. 
The study investigator must scor e all abnormal laboratory values as  either CS or NCS. Because 
some laboratory values may be outside of the nor mal value range due to the underlying disease, 
the study investigators should us e clinical judgment when considering clinical significance. 
Clinical significance is defined as any change in  laboratory parameters fr om baseline, which has 
medical relevance. If CS worsening of laborat ory values from screening levels is noted, the 
changes will be documented as an AE and scored per Section  10.6.1.4.3. The study investigator 
will continue to monitor the patient with additional laboratory assessments until (1) values have 
reached normal range and/or screen ing levels, or, (2) in the judgment of the study investigator, 
abnormal values are not relate d to the administration of IMP or other protocol-specific 
procedures. 
9.1.9 Safety biomarkers 
Biomarkers for monitoring the safety of olipudase alfa include, but are not limited to hsCRP, ceramide, iron, ferritin, cardiac-specific troponin I,  calcitonin, IL-6 and IL-8. Samples will be 
collected as specified in Section 1.2  and Section  1.3 study flow charts.

antibodies to olipudase alfa.  
9.2 SECONDARY ENDPOINTS 
9.2.1 Pharmacokinetics  
9.2.1.1 Sampling time 
Pharmacokinetic sampling will occur with the first infusion at 0.3, 1.0 and 3.0 mg/kg olipudase 
alfa and at Week 52. Specific time points and collection time windows are detailed in Section  1.5 
for each age cohort. To minimize the amount of blood drawn, post-dose ti me points have been 
selected for sparse sampling of pharmac okinetic parameters a nd microsampling methods 
(volumes ≤ 0.5 mL) may be used.   
If a patient receives only a partial infusion (e g, due to a safety concern), pharmacokinetic 
sampling will be repeated the next time the patient receives that dose. 
Depending on patient age, blood sa mples will be drawn for pharmac okinetic assessments using an 
indwelling catheter from an arm that is not used  for olipudase alfa infusions. The exact time of 
olipudase alfa infusions (start and stop times of infusion), rate of  infusion, time of infusion rate 
changes, and dose will be recorded along with exact sampling times.

 9.2.2.2 Pulmonary imaging by high resolution computed tomography 
High resolution computed tomography scans of the chest will be obtained as specified in 
Section 1.2  to quantitate the degree of possible infiltrative lung disease. 
High resolution computed tomography will be perf ormed using methods that  are compatible with 
the standard institutional procedures of the investigational site. Images will be collected centrally by a medical imaging core laboratory where they will be digitized and coded, and read by a third 
party blinded to patient number a nd study visit. The mean density will be calculated at each lung 
level using standard HRCT software. The lung fields will be assessed by a central reader and 
scored subjectively for the degree of interstitial lung disease (0 = normal, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, or 3 = severe) ( 10). 
The bilateral lung boundaries are determined fro m the following 4 pre-defined levels on the 
HRCT images ( 10). 
• Level 1 includes the aortic arch 
• Level 2 includes the carina 
• Level 3 is midway between the carina  and 1 cm above the hemidiaphragm 
• Level 4 is 1 cm a bove the hemidiaphragm 
A qualitative assessment will be made of the inters titial, reticular, nodular and pleura areas of the 
right and left lungs based on the following criteria: 
• 0 = No disease 
• 1 = Mild (affecting 1 to 25% of the lung volume) 
• 2 = Moderate (affecting 26 to 50% of the lung volume) 
• 3 = Severe (affecting 51 to 100% of the lung volume) 
• NE = Not evaluable 
Procedures for HRCT are deta iled in the study manual.  
9.2.2.3 Pulmonary function testing 
Pulmonary function testing (PFT) will be performed at the time points specified in Section 1.2  in 
patients ≥5 years old on day 1/week 0. Completion of  PFT may also depend upon patient age 
and/or cooperation.

X-rays will be collected at the site and sent to a medical imaging core laboratory where they will be digitized (if not already done at the site), code d, and read by a third party blinded to patient 
number and study visit. Bone age will be calculated using the Greulich & Pyle Atlas.  
9.2.2.6 Cycle ergometry 
Cycle ergometry will be performed within 1 week after infusion at the time points specified in Section 1.2 . This assessment is not re quired in patients that are ≤ 6 years of age or <120 cm in 
height on day 1/week 0. Completion of the assessment may depend upon patient cooperation. 
Cardiopulmonary status will be assessed using a stationary one-wheeled cycle used as an ergometer to measure a person's work output unde r controlled conditions. Patients will be asked to 
ride the cycle at increasing workload levels until they can no longer proceed. Patients will breathe through a tube connected to a one-way valve for continuous measurements of oxygen (O
2) uptake, 
carbon dioxide (CO 2) output, and tidal volume throughout the test. Heart rate, respiratory rate, and 
digital O 2 saturation will also be continuously monitore d. Steady state levels for each workload 
will be calculated for O 2 uptake, CO 2 output, tidal volume, ventilati on, and respiratory exchange 
ratio. Maximum workload achieved will be recorded and expressed as percent predicted. In addition, percent predicted max imum will be calculated for O
2 uptake and heart rate.  Note that

9.2.4 Pharmacogenetic assessments 
9.2.4.1 Genotyping of SMPD1, CHIT1, UGT1A1 and genes 
The acid sphingomyelinase gene ( SMPD1 ), the chitotriosidase gene ( CHIT1 ) and the uridine 
diphosphoglucuronosyltransferase 1 family, polypeptide A1 gene ( UGT1A1 ) will be sequenced if 
historical results are not available.  
A blood sample will be sent to a centralized laboratory where it will be extracted to yield DNA. 
The DNA will be amplified by polymerase chain reaction using gene specific primers and the 
resulting PCR products will be sequenced for the identification of mutations and genetic variation 
(polymorphisms and associated haplotypes) within the genes. The chitotriosidase gene will be analyzed for the presence or absence of the 24-base pair duplication mutation. SMPD1  mutations 
of patients participating in this study will be summarized and may be compared to those previously identified in ASDM patients from historical data outside of this study. Mutations will 
be annotated according to the guidelines of the Human Genome Variation Society ( 12). 
9.3 OTHER ASSESSMENTS 
9.3.1 Demographic information and medical/surgical history

A Western blot assay will be developed to evaluate cross- reactive immunological material 
(CRIM) on peripheral blood mononuclear cells to determine each patient’s CRIM status. An alternative method may be considered pending sufficient cell counts in patient blood samples. 
This assessment is to be performed as specified in Section 1.2  and is not required in patients that 
are >2 years of age.  
Sample processing, storage, and shipment guidelines are provided the study manual.  
9.3.5 Patient photographs 
Photographs (eg, abdominal) w ill be taken as specified in Section 1.2  of patients who volunteer to 
provide visual context of the disease. 
9.4 FUTURE USE OF SAMPLES 
For patients who have consented to  it, left over samples following testing may be used for other 
research purposes (excluding genetic analysis) related to ASMD.  These other research analyses will help to understa nd either disease subtypes or drug response, or 
to develop and/or validate a bi oassay method, or to identify new drug targets or biomarkers.  
These samples will remain labeled with the same identifiers than the one used during the study 
(ie, subject ID). They will be transferred to a Sanofi site (or a subcontractor site) which can be 
located outside of the country where the study is conducted. The sponsor has included safeguards 
for protecting subject confiden tiality and personal data (see Section  14.3 and  Section  14.5).

 10 STUDY PROCEDURES 
10.1 VISIT SCHEDULE 
 Section 1.2  summarizes the schedule of study events for all patients enrolled in the study, with 
specific requirements based upon patient age and gender. Details on the timing of study 
assessments are provided below and in Section  1.3, Section  1.4, Section  1.5 and in Section  10.3.2 
through Section  10.3.7. Individual evaluations are also described in Section  9.  
10.2 SCREENING AND INCLUSION PROCEDURES 
During screening, the patient or a patient representative will receive information on the study 
objective(s) and procedures from the investigator. The patient and/or  patient representative (parent 
or legal guardian) will have to sign the informed assent/consent prior to any action related to the study. Screening assessments as specified in Section 1.2  may need several out-patient visits to the 
site or in-patient hospitalization may be required to proceed with a ll screening or baseline 
assessments. Two samples are to be collected greater than 24 hours apart during the screening period for platelet count assessments. The mean platelet count  is to be used for determining 
patient eligibility.  
Patients who meet all the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will be eligible for 
inclusion into the study. 
Retesting of any screening parameter is limited to a maximum of 3 times and with a minimum of 
14 days in between reassessments. Unless indicated otherwise, the last retest value will be considered as the baseline va lue and reported in the e-CRF. 
Screening procedures will be carried out within 60 days prior to the start of 64-week treatment period of DFI13803. 
If a patient does not meet all inclusion criteria or meets one or  more exclusion criterion within 
60 days prior to the start of the treatment period, the patient may rescreen for the study once. For 
screening failures, the following data obtained during screening will be transferred to the e-CRF 
and entered into the database: patient’s demographic data, incl usion and exclusion criteria, 
relevant medical history and surgical history (if available), previous and concomitant medications 
(if available), AE data (if available) and reason for failure.

 10.3 TREATMENT PERIOD PROCEDURES 
Final inclusion in the study will be performed just before study drug infusion at Day 1/Week 0 of 
the treatment period.  
Retesting of parameters during the treatment period is limited to one time, except for when the 
measurement has not been obtai ned in accurate conditions.  
The dose escalation phase and the 64-week treatme nt period begins with the first intravenous 
infusion of 0.03 mg/kg olipudase alfa on Day 1/W eek 0.The dose escalation phase ends with the 
first infusion at 3.0 mg/kg or with the identifica tion of a patient-specific highest tolerated dose. 
Day 1/Week 0 and Week 12 assessments and samp les are to be collected per quarterly visit 
specifications, even though patients are actively dose escalating at these clinical visits. Samples are not to be collected in dupli cate (ie, Week 12 quarterly vis it and dose escalation visit) under 
such circumstances.  
10.3.1 Hospitalization 
In-patient hospitalizati on will be required before and for at  least 24 hours after infusion for all 
infusions during the dose escalation process through the second infusion at the highest tolerated dose. Patients may be required to stay in the hospital for additional time for safety purposes at the investigator’s discretion. If disc harged 24 hours after infusion, patie nts are required to return to 
the clinical site for assessments at 48 hours post infusion, and at 96 hours post infusion if necessary for pharmacokinetic samples.  
After the second infusion at the highest tolerabl e dose, patients will be observed for a minimum of 
3 hours following infusion completion, and may be di scharged at the investigator’s discretion. For 
quarterly visits at Week 26, Week 38 and Week  52 patients will be observed for a minimum of 
3 hours following infusion completion, and may be discharged at the investigator’s discretion. 
However, patients are required to return to th e clinical site for assessments at 24 hours and 
48 hours post infusion, and at 96 hours if ne cessary for pharmacokinetic samples.  
10.3.2 Day 1/Week 0 procedures (Quarterly visit schedule)  
After a patient (or parent or guardian) has provi ded informed consent, met all inclusion and none 
of the exclusion criteria, the following assessments are to be completed at Day 1/Week 0 as 
follows:  
• Complete physical exam: within 24 hours prior to olipudase alfa infusion (pre-infusion).

 10.3.10 Pregnancy 
Pregnancy will lead to permanent treatment discon tinuation in all cases. No studies of olipudase 
alfa have been conducted in pregnant women. To en sure patient safety for this study, all female 
patients of childbearing potentia l must have a negative serum β-hCG pregnancy test at screening 
and before undergoing any further assessments and procedures. In addition, these patients are 
required to have a negative urine β-hCG pregnancy test every 4 weeks before undergoing visit 
specific assessments and re ceiving olipudase alfa.  
Every effort should be made to prevent preg nancy during this study. Female patients of 
childbearing potential and male patients are required to practice true abstinence in line with their 
preferred and usual lifestyle or use two accepta ble effective methods of contraception, a barrier 
method such as a condom or occlusive cap (diaph ragm or cervical/vault cap) with spermicidal 
foam/gel/film/cream/sup pository and an established non-barrier method  such as oral, injected, or 
implanted hormonal methods, an intr auterine device or intrauterine system for the duration of the 
study. 
10.4 DEFINITION OF SOURCE DATA 
Source data includes all information in original reco rds and certified copies of original records of 
clinical findings, observations, or other activitie s necessary for the reconstruction and evaluation 
of the trial. Source data are contained in source documents. 
Source documents are original documents, data an d records (eg, hospital records, clinical and 
office charts, laboratory reports and notes, memo randa, patient diaries or  evaluation checklists, 
pharmacy dispensing records, recorded data from automated instruments, copies or transcripts 
certified after verification as being accurate a nd complete, microfiches, photographic negatives, 
microfilm or magnetic media, X-rays, patient files, and records kept at the pharmacy, at the 
laboratories, and at medical-tec hnical departments) involved in  the clinical study. Source 
documentation must be maintained to s upport information provided in the e-CRF. 
10.5 HANDLING OF TEMPORARY OR PERMANENT TREATMENT DISCONTINUATION 
The IMP should be continued whenever possibl e. In case the IMP is stopped, it should be 
determined whether the stop can be made tempor arily; permanent IMP discontinuation should be 
a last resort. Any IMP discontinuation should be  fully documented in the source and e-CRF. In 
any case, the patient should remain in the study as long as possible.  
Pregnancy will lead to treatment discontinuation in all cases.

 10.5.1 Temporary treatment discontinuation with investigational medicinal product(s) 
Temporary treatment discontinuation decided by the investigator corresponds to more than 
1 infusion not administered to the patient. 
Temporary treatment discontinua tion (also referred to as treatment interruption) may be 
considered by the investigator because of suspected AEs. Re-initiation of treatment  with the IMP will be done under cl ose and appropriate clinical/and or 
laboratory monitoring once the investigator has cons idered to his/her best medical judgment that 
the selection criteria for the study are still met (refer to Section  7.1 and Section  7.2). Before 
re-initiation of treatment, the sponsor must be consulted to deter mine the starting dose and if dose 
escalation is required (see Section  8.3.3 and Section  8.3.4). 
For all temporary treatment discontinuations, the duration should be recorded by the investigator 
in the appropriate screens of the e-CRF. 
10.5.2 Permanent treatment discontinuation with investigational medicinal product(s) 
Permanent treatment discontinuation is any tr eatment discontinuation associated with the 
definitive decision from the investigator or the patient not to re-expose the patient to the IMP at any time. 
10.5.3 List of criteria for permanent treatment discontinuation 
The patient may withdraw from treatment with the IMP if he/she decides to do so, at any time and irrespective of the reason, or this may be the investigator’s or sponsor’s decision. All efforts 
should be made to document the reasons for treatment discontinuati on and this should be 
documented in the e-CRF. 
Patients should discontinue the IMP for the following reasons: 
• Unacceptable toxicity (see Section  8.3.4.2). 
• The need for intervention or therapy preclud ed by protocol, and determination by the 
investigator that it is medically necessary to do so. 
• Patient noncompliance with trea tment or if the patient wishes to be withdrawn from 
treatment. 
• The patient is no longer deriving clinical be nefit, in the opinion of the investigator. 
• Pregnancy  
In addition, the sponsor may decide to discontin ue the trial prematurely for any other reason.  
Any abnormal laboratory value or ECG parameter relevant to th e situation will be immediately 
rechecked for confirmation before making a deci sion of permanent discontinuation of the IMP for 
the concerned patient.

 10.5.4 Handling of patients after permanent treatment discontinuation 
If a patient or parent/legal guardian decides to di scontinue participation in the study, he should be 
contacted by the study investigator in order to obtain information about the reason(s) for 
discontinuation and collecti on of any potential AEs. 
When possible, all tests and evaluations listed in Section 1.2  for the post treatment withdrawal 
visit should be carried out within 2 weeks of the last olipudase alfa infusion . If a patient fails to 
return for the necessary visits, every effort must be made to contact the patient and determine the 
reason(s) and recorded on the e-CRF. 
In all cases, the sponsor must be notified of a ll study terminations as soon as possible and the 
reason for and date of withdrawal from the stud y must be recorded in the e-CRF and in the 
patient’s medical record. 
10.5.5 Procedure and consequence for patient withdrawal from study 
If possible, the patients are assessed using th e procedure indicated for study withdrawal in 
Section 1.2 . 
For patients who fail to return to the site, the inve stigator should make the best effort to contact 
the patient (eg, contacting patient’s family or private physician, re viewing available registries or 
health care databases), and to dete rmine his/her health status, includi ng at least his/her vital status. 
Attempts to contact such patients must be documented in the patient’s records (eg, times and dates 
of attempted telephone contact, receipt  for sending a registered letter). 
The statistical analysis plan (SAP) will specify how these patients lost to follow-up for their primary endpoints w ill be considered. 
10.5.6 Replacement of patients  
The minimum number of patients to be eval uated by age cohort is specified in Section 6.1 . Once 
these are met, if a patient prematurely disconti nues the study after tolerating 2 consecutive doses 
of olipudase alfa at 0.3 mg/kg, an  additional patient  may be enrolled. 
10.6 OBLIGATION OF THE INVESTIGATOR REGARDING SAFETY REPORTING 
10.6.1 Definitions of adverse events  
10.6.1.1 Adverse event 
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation patient 
administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal 
relationship with this treatment.

 10.6.1.2 Serious adverse event 
An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: 
• Results in death, or 
• Is life-threatening, or 
Note: The term “life-threatening” in the definition of “serious” refers to an event in which 
the patient was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe. 
• Requires inpatient hos pitalization or prolongation of  existing hospitalization, or 
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or 
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect 
• Is a medically important event 
Medical and scientific judgme nt should be exercised in deciding whether expedited 
reporting is appropriate in othe r situations, such as important medical events that may not 
be immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the patient or may require medical or surgical in tervention (ie, specific measures or corrective 
treatment) to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition above. 
Note: The following list of medically important events is intended to serve as a guideline for determining which condition has to be considered as a medicall y important event. The list is not 
intended to be exhaustive: 
- Intensive treatment in an emer gency room or at home for: 
a) Allergic bronchospasm, 
b) Blood dyscrasias (ie, agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia, bone marrow aplasia, myelodysplasia, pancytopenia, etc),  
c) Convulsions (seizures, epilepsy, epileptic fit, absence, etc). 
- Development of drug de pendence or drug abuse 
- Suicide attempt or any even t suggestive of suicidality 
- Syncope, loss of consciousness (except if  documented as a consequence of blood 
sampling) 
- Bullous cutaneous eruptions 
- Cancers diagnosed during the study or aggravated during the study (only if judged unusual/significant by the investigators in oncology studies) 
- Chronic neurodegenerative diseases (newly diagnosed) or aggravated during the study (only if judged unusual/significant by the investigators).

 10.6.1.3 Adverse event of special interest 
An AESI is an AE (serious or non-serious) of scientific and medical concern specific to the 
sponsor’s product or program, for which ongoin g monitoring and rapid communication by the 
investigator to the sponsor may be appropriate. Such events may require further investigation in 
order to characterize and understand them. Adverse events of special interest may be added or 
removed during a study by protocol amendment. 
AESIs include the following: 
10.6.1.3.1 Pregnancy 
Pregnancy of a female patient entered in the st udy as well as pregnancy occurring in female 
partner of a male patient enrolled in this study. See Section 10.7  for additional details.  
10.6.1.3.2 Infusion-associated reactions 
Some AEs may be manifestations of IARs, in cluding hypersensitivity reaction, acute phase 
reactions (APR), and cytokine release syndrome (CRS), as described in Section  10.6.1.3.2.1, 
Section  10.6.1.3.2.2, and Section  10.6.1.3.2.3, respectively. However, original signs and 
symptoms must be reported as AEs. In the e-CRF , investigators are asked to identify whether a 
specific AE represents a clinical manifestation of the IAR. Infusion-associated reactions are defined as AEs that occur during the infusion or within up to 
24 hours after the start of infusion and are consider ed as related or possibly related to the study 
treatment by the investigator or the sponsor. An event occurring ≥24 hours after the start of an 
infusion may be judged an IAR at the discretion of the investigator or sponsor. For this study of 
olipudase alfa, IARs may present as different types of reactions, such as hypersensitivity 
reactions, APRs, and CRS. 
10.6.1.3.2.1 Hypersensitivity reactions 
Infusion-associated hypersensitivity reactions se en with other enzyme replacement therapies are 
typically immunoglobulin-mediated (IgG/IgE) and occur after sensitization. After subsequent 
exposure to the antigen typically early into or shortly after the infusion, a “sensitized” patient may 
experience a broad range of allergic reactions that can be mild to severe or life threatening. Anaphylaxis (or anaphylactic reaction) is a serious, IgE mediated allergic reaction that is rapid in onset, and may cause death ( 15). Anaphylactoid, or non-immunologic  anaphylaxis, reactions may 
present with similar serious clini cal manifestations as anaphylaxi s, but without prior exposure to 
the drug and are due to nonimmunologic-m ediated mast cell de granulation. Although 
mechanistically different, anaphylactic and anaphylactoid reactions are treated similarly. 
Common symptoms of hypersensitivity reactions seen with other enzyme replacement therapy 
include urticaria, rash, dyspnea, and less fr equently, angioedema. Other symptoms of 
hypersensitivity IARs, APRs and CRS include fe ver, hypotension, tachycardia, nausea, vomiting, 
pain, and headache. 
There were no IAR suggestive of hypersensitivity in the Phase 1b trial ( 6).

Property of the Sanofi Group- strictly confidential Page 74 
 10.6.1.3.2.2 Acute phase reactions 
Acute phase reactions observed in the phase 1 and phase 1b studies are considered as one type of 
IAR, specific to the infused olipudase alfa therapy ( 5, 6). From observations in both studies the 
APR reactions typically occurred within 12-72 hour s following an infusion of olipudase alfa and 
were indicative of an inflammatory response. APRs were associated with elevations in hsCRP and changes acute phase reactants including, but not  limited to, neutrophils, ir on, ferritin, fibrinogen, 
D-dimer, transferrin, albumin, protime, and par tial thromboplastin time. Patient AEs associated 
with the APR included (but are not limited to) pyrexia, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, and pain. Acute phase reaction is determined ba sed on combined significant laboratory findings and clinical 
symptoms. 
10.6.1.3.2.3 Cytokine release syndrome 
Cytokine release syndrome is another type of IA R, attributed to the release of excessive amounts 
of cytokines shortly after the intravenous administr ation of certain therapeutic agents. The severe 
form of CRS is a cytokine storm, which may be life threatening. Nonclinical studies of high-dose 
olipudase alfa have suggested th e possibility of cytokine releas e syndrome. The Phase 1 single 
dose study ( 5) demonstrated increases in IL-8 and IL-6; macrophage inflammatory protein 1, 
alpha component; macrophage inflammatory protein 1, beta com ponent; and other cytokines and 
biomarkers (based Myriad Rules-Based Medicine Human Multi-Analyte Profile® antigen panel) 
after a single dose of ≥0.3 mg/kg olipudase alfa. In the Phase 1b trial, increases in mean IL-6 and 
IL-8 values were associated with the first admin istrations of olipudase alfa at doses 0.6 mg/kg 
through 2.0 mg/kg and tended to be conc urrent with acute phase responses (6). Unlike 
immunoglobulin-mediated hypersensitivity reactions, no prior antigen exposure is required for the development of CRS. Symptoms of CRS develop soon after exposure, and range from mild to 
severe. Although CRS shares some symptoms with other IARs (ie, hypersensitivity reactions and 
APRs), symptoms typical of CRS include pyrexia, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, pain, myalgia, and in severe cases, multi-organ system dysfunction or failure, severe headache, and pulmonary edema. Cytokine release syndrome is determined based on combined significant laboratory findings and 
clinical symptoms. 
10.6.1.4 Definitions for criteria of adverse events 
10.6.1.4.1 Definition of a protocol-related adverse event 
A protocol-related AE is an AE occurring during a clinical study that is not product related (either 
investigational or control), but is  considered by the investigator or the Medical Monitor to be 
related to the research conditions (ie, related to the fact that a patient is participating in the study). 
For example, a protocol-r elated AE may be an untoward even t occurring during a washout period 
of a treatment other than the i nvestigational product or an even t related to a medical procedure 
required by the protocol.

Property of the Sanofi Group- strictly confidential Page 75 
 10.6.1.4.2 Relationship to study treatment 
Assessment of the association between the AE an d study exposure is important for regulatory 
reporting. This assessment is to be made in bli nded studies and also for known comparators. For 
each AE/SAE the investigator is to deter mine whether there is a reasonable possibility 
demonstrated by evidence which suggests a cau sal relationship between the study treatment and 
the AE according to the categories below: 
• Not Related: There is no suspicion of a cau sal relationship between exposure and the AE. 
• Unlikely Related: There is no evidence for a causal relationship between exposure and the 
AE; however, such a relationship cannot be ruled out. 
• Possibly Related: There is some evidence supporting the possibility of a causal relationship between exposure and the AE. 
• Related: There is strong evidence that there is a causal relationship between exposure and 
the AE. 
A relationship to the investigati onal product must be assigned for each AE/SAE recorded, even if 
there is only limited information at the time. The investigator may change his/her opinion of causality in light of follow-up information, amending the AE/SAE report accordingly. 
10.6.1.4.3 Severity of adverse event scoring 
Note that “severity” is not the same as “seriousness”, which is defined in Section  10.6.1.2. 
Intensity: 
• Mild = no modification of daily activities and does not require mandatory corrective/symptomatic treatment 
• Moderate = hinders normal daily activities and/or requires mandatory corrective/symptomatic treatment 
• Severe = prevents daily activities and requires mandatory corrective/symptomatic 
treatment 
10.6.1.4.4 Outcome 
Outcome describes the status of the AE. The investigator will provide information regarding the 
patient outcome of each AE. Definitions for possible results of an AE include: 
• Fatal: The termination of life as a result of an AE. 
• Not recovered/not resolved: The patient has not recuperated or th e AE has not improved. 
• Recovering/resolving: The patient is recuperating or the AE is improving. 
• Recovered/Resolved: The patient has r ecuperated or the AE has resolved. 
• Recovered with sequelae/resolved  with sequelae: The AE has resolved, but the patient has 
been left with symptoms or pathology. 
• Unknown: Not known, not observed, not recorded, or refused.

 10.6.1.4.5 Action taken regarding the investigational product 
The investigator will be required to provide the action taken regarding investigational product 
(eg, active, comparator) in response to the AE. Options include:  
• Dose increased: Increase in the frequency, strength or amount of investigational product 
administered. 
• Dose not changed: No change in adminis tration of the inve stigational product. 
• Dose reduced: Reduction in the frequency, stre ngth or amount of investigational product 
administered. 
• Drug (investigational product) interrupted: Temporary interruption in administration of the 
investigational product. 
• Drug (investigational product)  withdrawn: Administration of the investigational product 
terminated (no further dosing). 
• Not applicable: Determination of a value is not relevant in the current context. 
• Unknown: Not known, not observed, not recorded, or refused. 
10.6.2 General guidelines for reporting adverse events 
• All AEs, regardless of seriousness or rela tionship to IMP/NIMP, spanning from the 
signature of the informed consent form until the end of the study as defined by the 
protocol for that patient, are to be recorded  on the corresponding page(s) or screen(s) of 
the e-CRF. 
• Except for IARs, whenever possible, diagnos is or single syndrome should be reported 
instead of symptoms. For IARs, all symptoms must be separately recorded. 
• The investigator should specify the date of ons et, intensity, action taken with respect to 
IMP, corrective treatment/therapy given, additional investigations performed, outcome, and his/her opinion as to whether there is a reasonable possibility that the AE was caused 
by the IMP. 
• The investigator should take appropriate measures to follow a ll AEs until clinical recovery 
is complete and laboratory results have returned to normal, or until progression has been 
stabilized, or until death, in order to ensure the safety of the patients. 
• When treatment is prematurely discontinued, the patient’s observations will continue until the end of the study as defined by the protocol. 
• Laboratory, vital signs or ECG abnormalities are to be recorded as AEs only if:  
- Symptomatic and/or  
- Requiring either corrective trea tment or consu ltation, and/or  
- Leading to IMP discontinuation or modification of dosing, and/or  
- Fulfilling a seriousness criterion, and/or  
- Defined as an AESI (see Section  10.6.1.3)

 10.6.3 Instructions for reporting serious adverse events 
In the case of occurrence of an SAE, the investigator must immediately: 
• ENTER (within 24 hours) the information related to the SAE in the appropriate screens of 
the e-CRF; the system will automatically send a notification to the monitoring team after 
approval of the investigator within th e e-CRF or after a standard delay. 
• SEND (preferably by fax or e-mail) a photocop y of all examinations carried out and the 
dates on which these examinations were perform ed, to the representative of the monitoring 
team whose name, fax number, and email addr ess appear on the clin ical trial protocol. 
Care should be taken to ensure that the patient's identity is protected and the patient's 
identifiers in the clinical trial are properly mentioned on any copy of a source document 
provided to the sponsor. For laboratory results, include the laboratory normal ranges. 
• All further data updates should be recorded in the e-CRF as appropriate, and further 
documentation as well as additional information (for laboratory data, concomitant medications, patient status, etc)  should be sent (by fax or e- mail) to the monitoring team 
within 24 hours of knowledge of the SAE. In addition, every effort should be made to 
further document any SAE that is fatal or life threatening within a week (7 days) of the initial notification. 
• A back-up plan (using a paper CRF process) is available and should be used when the 
e-CRF system does not work.  
Any SAE brought to the attention of the investigator at any time after the end of the study for the patient and considered by him/her  to be caused by the IMP with a reasonable possibility, should 
be reported to the monitoring team. 
10.6.4 Guidelines for reporting adverse events of special interest   
10.6.4.1 Reporting of adverse events of special interest with immediate notification 
For AESIs the sponsor will be informed within 24 hours as per the SAE notification instructions 
described in Section 10.6.3, even if not fulfilling a seriousness criterion, using the corresponding 
screens in the e-CRF. 
• Pregnancy 
- Pregnancy occurring in a female patient included in the clinical trial as well as 
pregnancy occurring in a female partner of a male patient enrolled in the study. 
Pregnancy will be recorded as an AESI with immediate notification in all cases. It will be qualified as an SAE only if it fulfills the SAE criteria. 
- In the event of pregnancy, study drug should be discontinued. 
- Follow-up of the pregnancy is mandatory until the outcome has been determined.

- Cytokine release syndrome (see Section  10.6.1.3.2.3) 
• Symptomatic overdose with IMP 
Note:  An overdose (accidental or intentional) of study drug is defined as an increase of at 
least 30% of the dose to be administered in  the specified duration or if the dose is 
administered in less than half the re commended duration of administration. The 
circumstances (ie, accidental or intentional) will be clearly specified in the verbatim and

10.7 PREGNANCY REPORTING 
Female patients will be instructed to notify the investigator immediately if they discover they are 
pregnant. Pregnant female patients will be discontinued from the study.  
Male patients will be instructed to notify the investigator immediately if they discover that their 
sexual partner is pregnant. 
If the investigator learns of a report of pregnancy at any time after signing the informed consent, 
the investigator should follow the instructions in Section 10.6.4.1  to contact the sponsor within 
24 hours. The investigator is to complete the AE  form, the Safety Complementary form and the 
Pregnancy forms. The patient will be followed un til the outcome of the pregnancy is known (eg, 
live birth or stillbirth). The investigator  will be responsible for this follow-up. 
If not otherwise established, the i nvestigator will inform the patient that the sponsor is required to 
gather information regarding the course and outco me of the pregnancy after exposure to a study 
product. The progress of the pregnancy must be followed until the outcome of the pregnancy is 
known (ie, delivery, elective termination, or spontan eous abortion). If the pregnancy results in the 
birth of a child, additional follow-up information may be requested. 
The investigator will be asked to obtain follow-up information no later than 2 months after the 
gestational period to obtain mate rnal/fetal/neonatal outcome and any other relevant information.

 Follow-up information may be requested at additional time points. All study related visits/contacts 
involving a known pregnancy should include pregnancy status assessment until pregnancy outcome is known. 
Please note that pregnancy in and of itself is not an AE or an SAE. Pregnancy should not be 
entered into the e-CRF as an AE unless the investigator suspects an interaction between the study 
treatment and the contraceptive method. Additionally all informati on received will be assessed for 
any AEs and SAEs and processed per study guidelines. If the patient is discontinued because of pregnancy, pregnancy will be documented as th e reason for study discontinuation. Spontaneous 
abortions and stillbirths are reported as SAEs. 
10.8 OBLIGATIONS OF THE SPONSOR 
During the course of the study, the s ponsor will report in an expedited manner: 
• All SAEs that are both unexpected and at le ast reasonably related to the IMP (suspected 
unexpected serious adverse reaction), to the health authorities, IECs/IRBs as appropriate and to the investigators. 
• All SAEs that are expected and at least reasonably related to the IMPs to the health authorities, according to local regulations. 
The sponsor will report all safety observations made during the conduct  of the trial in the clinical 
study report. 
10.9 ADVERSE EVENTS MONITORING 
All events will be managed and reported in compliance with all applicable regulations, and included in the final clinical study report.

 11 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
A SAP will be written and finalized prior to database lock to give guidance to the statistical 
analysis. It will be in compliance with the International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) and Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) Guidance for Industry: Statistical Principles for Clinical 
Trials. 
The sponsor or its designee will perform the statisti cal analysis of the data from this study. The 
analysis will be performed using the SAS
® statistical software system Version 9.1 2 or higher. 
11.1 DETERMINATION OF SAMPLE SIZE 
No formal sample size calculations have been performed. Sample size for this study was based 
upon empirical considerations.  A total of at least 20 patients with ASMD < 18 years of age will be enrolled.  At least 12 patients will be enrolled in a staggered fashion to 3 age cohorts with a minimum of 3 
patients aged from 12 to <18 years (adolescent cohor t), 3 patients aged from 6 to <12 years (child 
cohort), and 2 patients with ages ranging from birth to <6 years (infant/early child cohort); 
followed by at least 8 additional patients <12 ye ars enrolled without staggering. Out of the 8 
additional patients, at leas t 4 patients in the child cohort and at least 2 patients in the infant/early 
child cohort will be enrolled. 
11.2 DISPOSITION OF PATIENTS 
Screened patients are defined as any patient who signed the informed consent, signed informed 
assent or whose parent or guardian signed informed consent. 
Enrolled patients are defined as those who meet th e inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion 
criteria. All patients who receive an infusi on of olipudase alfa (total or partial) will be included in the 
summary of patient disposition.  The number of patients screened, enrolled, treate d, completing the study, and not completing 
study along with primary reason for discontinuation will be presented. The number of screen 
failures, and the reason for screen failure, will also be presented. Patient disposition data will also 
be listed.

 withdrawn due to intolerance of 0.1 or 0.3 mg/kg olipudase alfa, their safety data will be reported 
up to and including the time of withdrawal, and follow-up for AEs, where applicable.  
The baseline value is defined generally as the last available value before study drug 
administration. 
Selected safety data may be pr esented by manufacturing scale. 
For all safety data, the observation period will be divided into three segments: 
• The pre-treatment period is defined as the time between when the patient gives informed 
consent and the start of the first IMP administration (excluded);  
• The on-treatment period will be defined as the time from the start of IMP administration (included) and till end of Week  64, or end of study (EOS); 
• The post-treatment period is defined as the time after the EOS visit (excluded). 
The following definitions will be applied to laboratory parameters, vital signs and ECG. 
• The potentially clinically significant abnorma lity (PCSA) values are defined as abnormal 
values considered medically important by the sponsor according to predefined criteria/thresholds based on lite rature review and defined by the sponsor for clinical 
laboratory tests, vital signs, and ECG. 
• Potentially clinically signif icant abnormality criteria will de termine which patients had at 
least 1 PCSA during the treatment emergent pe riod, taking into account all evaluations 
performed during the treatment emergent pe riod, including unscheduled or repeated 
evaluations. The number of all such patients will be the numerator for the treatment emergent PCSA percentage. 
• Treatment period: the treatment period used for quantitative analysis is defined as the time from first infusion to the last study drug infusion + 14 Days. 
11.4.2.1 Adverse events 
The definitions in Section  10.6.1 will be used for AEs. Pre-treatment AEs will be listed and 
presented separately from treatment-emergent AEs. 
Adverse events will be coded according to the most recent version of the Medical Dictionary for 
Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). Adverse event incidence tables will be presented by MedDRA 
system organ class (SOC) (sorted by internationally agreed order) and preferred term (PT) sorted 
in decreasing number of patients within SOCs and further alphabetical order within the same 
number of patients over different PTs for each age group, the number (n) and percentage (%) of 
patients experiencing an AE. Multiple occurrences of the same event in the same patient will be counted only once in the tables within a treatment period. The denominator for computation of 
percentages is the safety population for the entire study and each age group cohort. 
Adverse events will be classified into pre-define d standard categories according to chronological 
criteria:

 13 STUDY MONITORING 
13.1 RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE INVESTIGATOR(S) 
The investigator is required to ensure compliance with all procedures required by the clinical trial 
protocol and with all study pro cedures provided by the sponsor (including security rules). The 
investigator agrees to provide reliable data and all information requested by the clinical trial protocol (with the help of the e-CRF , Discrepancy Resolution Form [DRF] or other appropriate 
instrument) in an accurate and legible manner acco rding to the instructions provided and to ensure 
direct access to source documents by sponsor representatives. 
If any circuit includes transfer of  data particular attention should be paid to the confidentiality of 
the patient’s data to be transferred. The investigator may appoint such other indi viduals as he/she may deem appropriate as 
subinvestigators to assist in the conduct of the clinical trial in ac cordance with the clinical trial 
protocol. All subinvestigators shall be appointed and lis ted in a timely manner. The 
subinvestigators will be supervised by and work under the responsibility of the investigator. The 
investigator will provide them with a copy of the clinical trial protocol and all necessary information. 
13.2 RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE SPONSOR 
The sponsor of this clinical trial is responsible to regulatory au thorities for taking all reasonable 
steps to ensure the proper conduct of the clinical trial as regards ethics, clinical trial protocol 
compliance, and integrity and validity of the data  recorded on the e-CRFs. Thus, the main duty of 
the monitoring team is to help the investigator and the sponsor maintain a high level of ethical, 
scientific, technical and regulatory quality in all aspects of the clinical trial. 
At regular intervals during the clinical trial, the site will be contacted, through monitoring visits, 
letters or telephone calls, by a re presentative of the monitoring team to review study progress, 
investigator and patient compliance with clinical trial protocol requirements and any emergent problems. These monitoring visits will include but not be limited to review of the following aspects: patient informed consent, patient recruitment and follow- up, SAE documentation and 
reporting, AESI documentation and reporting, AE documenta tion, IMP allocation, patient

The investigator may terminate hi s/her participation upon thirty (30) days’ prior written notice if 
the study site or the investigator for any r eason becomes unable to pe rform or complete the 
clinical trial.  
In the event of premature discontinuation of the study or premature close-out of a site, for any 
reason whatsoever, the appropriate IRB/IEC and regulatory authorities should be informed 
according to applicable regulatory requirements. 
14.9 CLINICAL TRIAL RESULTS 
The sponsor will be responsible for preparing a c linical study report and to provide a summary of 
study results to the investigator. The coordinating investigator who will sign off on the study report will be the investigator who first enrolled the largest number of patients in the trial.  
14.10 PUBLICATIONS AND COMMUNICATIONS 
The investigator undertakes not to make any publication or release pertaining to the study and/or results of the study prior to the sponsor’s writte n consent, being understood that the sponsor will 
not unreasonably withhold its approval. 
As the study is being conducted at multiple sites, th e sponsor agrees that, cons istent with scientific 
standards, a primary presentation or publication of the study results based on global study 
outcomes shall be sought. However, if no mu lticenter publication is submitted, underway or 
planned within twelve (12) months  of the completion of this study at all sites, the investigator 
shall have the right to publish or present independently the results of this study in agreement with other investigators and stakeholders. The investigator shall provide the sponsor with a copy of any such presentation or publication for review and comment at least 30 days in advance of any 
presentation or submission for publication. In addition, if requested by the sponsor, any presentation or submission for publication shall be delayed for a limited time, not to exceed 90 days, to allow for filing of a pa tent application or such other ju stified measures as the sponsor

 15 CLINICAL TRIAL PR OTOCOL AMENDMENTS 
All appendices attached hereto and re ferred to herein are made part of this clinical trial protocol. 
The investigator should not implement  any deviation from, or changes of the clinical trial protocol 
without agreement by the sponsor and prior re view and documented appr oval/favorable opinion 
from the IRB/IEC of an amendment, except where necessary to eliminate an immediate hazard(s) 
to clinical trial patients, or when the change(s) involves only logistical or administrative aspects of the trial. Any change agreed upon will be reco rded in writing, the written amendment will be 
signed by the investigator and by the sponsor and the signed amendment will be filed with this clinical trial protocol. 
Any amendment to the clinical trial protocol requires written approval/favorable opinion by the 
IRB/IEC prior to its implementation, unle ss there are overriding safety reasons. 
In some instances, an amendment may require a change to the informed consent form. The investigator must receive an IRB/IEC approval/fa vorable opinion concerning the revised informed 
consent form prior to implementation of the change and patient signature should be re-collected if necessary.

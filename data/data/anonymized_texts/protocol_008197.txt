Page 6 of 23  1.0 INTRODUCTION 
Surgical Site Infection (SSI) is a major source of morbidity in both colorectal (CRS) and 
hepatopancreatobiliary (HPBS) surgery.  The SSI rate has been published to be between 20- 35% 
[1-3]. Specifically, colectomy for the treatment of colorectal cancer is associated with a SSI rate 
of 10 -30% [1] and hepatectomy for hepatocellular carcinoma has a SSI rate of 15- 25% [4, 5].  
Pancreaticoduodenectomy for pancreatic adenocarcinoma has a SSI rate of 10 -20% [2, 6]. Taken 
together, up to a third of patients undergoing  these complex abdominal surgeries will suffer the 
additional morbidity of SSI despite interventions such as appropriately timed and selected 
antibiotics.  This added level of morbidity increases the complexity of patient care during recovery 
from surgery,  lengthens post -operative hospitalizations and adds significant overall medical 
costs. Given these persistently high rates of SSI despite best practice standards, a low morbidity 
intervention such as the incisional wound vacuum assisted closure ( V.A.C ) system is an attractive 
technology to try to further improve SSI rates in these patients.  
 
V.A.C® technology or negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) has revolutionized the 
management of complex open wounds but its role in closed wounds remains undefined.  I nitial 
enthusiasm for its potential role in reducing SSI rates in closed laparotomy wounds came from a report in the cardiothoracic literature performed as a collaboration between Duke University 
Medical Center (DUMC) and the Durham VA Medical Center [ 7]
 .  Negative pressure wound 
therapy was applied to closed sternotomy wounds in 57 patients, with a 3% expected SSI rate.  No sternal wound infections were seen in any patients.  Though this initial report had small numbers of patients, the potential for this low morbidity technique to decrease SSI in sternotomy 
wounds was seen.  
 Several reports have investigated the preoperative patient -specific risk factors  as well as 
surgically -related risk factors to predict risk of developing SSI [ 8].  However, there is no reported 
study in the medical literature indicating the role or efficacy of either conventional wound care with sterile dressings or the application of V.A.C.® to postoperative abdominal i ncisions in 
preventing SSI.  However, both methods of wound care are employed on a daily basis in Duke University  hospital system (DUMC, Duke Raleigh Hospital and Durham Regional Hospital ) as well 
as other academic and private hospitals across the country.   The conventional approach to 
postoperative surgical wound care has little evidence- based data to support its practice and 
surgeons have been using incisional V.A.C.® technology for several years in an attempt to curtail 
SSI in high risk patients.     
2.0 NPWT SYSTEMS   
2.1 PREVENA INCISION  MANAGEMENT SYSTEM  
The Prevena Incision Management System (PIMS) is the first battery powered negative pressure 
product designed specifically for management of closed surgical incisions that continue to drain 
following sutured or stapled closure.  The P IMS covers and protects the incision from external 
infectious sources, while negative pressure removes fluid and infectious material from the surgical incision.  
The Prevena System accomplishes its intended purpose by means  of a dressing that seals the 
area around the incision site.  This dressing is fitted with connections for fluid/air lines that provide the means of communication between the wound and the suction apparatus.  The pump creates

Page 7 of 23  a negative pressure (vacuum) o f -125 mmHg relative to the wound and causes wound exudate 
to be pumped into the collection canister as necessary.  
 
PIMS consists of:  
• a small, portable, battery -powered suction pump,  
• a canister for the collection of wound fluids, and  
• a sterile, single us e dressing kit.    
 PIMS -associated dressing s include either the Peel and Place Dressing or the Customizable 
Dressing.  
 The PIMS Peel and Place dressing is an integrated, one- piece dressing comprised of a 
polyurethane film with acrylic adhesive that provides adhesion of the dressing to the skin surrounding the incision and a polyurethane shell that encapsulates the foam bolster and interface layer, providing a closed system.  The polyurethane foam has a pore size of 400- 600 microns 
and a violet colorant.  Additionally, the dressing has a built -in pressure indicator, which shows 
when system pressure is at an acceptable level,  and a skin interface layer with 0.019% ionic 
silver, which wicks fluid from the skin surface.  The silver is not intended to treat infection but to reduce potential for contamination of the skin interface layer with microbes. This type of Prevena™ Incision Management System is a 510(k) – cleared, Class II device (K100821) . 
 The Prevena Incision Management System with Customizable Dressing (Prevena Customizable) 
provides a new dressing configuration that has been designed to allow the clinician to cut the 
dressing to fit t he incision size and geometry. The skin contacting dressing components include:  
• a foam bolster with a skin interface layer,  
• a hydrocolloid ring that is attached to the foam bolster to assist dressing application and to help reduce dressing leaks,  
• hydrocolloid sealing strips for bridging foam dressing pieces, and  
• a polyurethane film (V.A.C. Drape ). 
 
This product was recently cleared under 510(k) K121883.  
 
PIMS  is intended to manage the environment of surgical incisions that continue to drai n following 
sutured or stapled closure by maintaining a closed environment and removing exudate via the application of negative pressure wound therapy.   The Prevena System is intended to be applied 
to the wound site immediately after surgery, and continue for a minimum of 2 days up to a 
maximum of 7 days, depending on the surgeon’s preference. 
2.2 ACTIV.A.C. THERAPY UNIT  
The ActiV.A.C. therapy unit can be used in special situations in which the incision is larger or has 
an unusual shape. It is also intended  to manage the environment of surgical incisions that 
continue to drain following sutured or stapled closure by maintaining a closed environment and 
removing exudates via the application of negative pressure wound therapy.  The unit is lightweight  
and portable to help patients resume their activities of daily living while still receiving the benefits

the Customizable dressing.  
 
The ActiV.A.C  unit consists of: 
• a small, portable, battery -powered suction pump,  
• a canister for the collection of wound fluids,  
The ActiV.A.C. is a 510(k) – cleared, Class II device (K120033). 
3.0 STUDY RATIONALE  
Patients undergoing colorectal (CRS) and hepatopancreatobiliary (HPBS) surgery  are at high risk 
for postoperative complications such SSI and wound dehiscence.  Such complications increase 
the complexity of patient care during recovery from surgery, lengthen post -operative 
hospitalizations, add significant overall medical cost s and may potentially diminish quality of life  
and economic livelihood. To date, there is no reported study to evaluate the efficacy of either 
conventional wound care with sterile dressings or the application of V.A.C.® to postoperative abdominal incisions  in preventing SSI.  Furthermore, there are currently no identifiable additional 
risks for receiving either conventional wound care or PIMS. Therefore, the proposed study will 
compare SSI rates for subjects receiving NPWT  via PIMS  or ActiV.A.C  to conventional wound 
care with sterile dressing.    
 
We hypothesize that incisional NPWT via PIMS or ActiV.A.C.(Kinetic Concepts  USA, Inc., San 
Antonio, TX) compared to conventionally closed laparotomy wounds may decrease the SSI rate 
in these subject populations which are associated with a high rate of postoperative wound 
complications.  
4.0 STUDY OBJECTIVES  
4.1 PRIMARY  
• To compare the incidence of SSI rates between conventional wound care versus the 
incisional NPWT via PIMS  or ActiV.A.C. within CRS or HPBS -associated laparotomy 
wounds as assessed on postoperative day 4-5 and the first postoperative clinic visit.  
4.2 SECONDARY  
• Characterize the incidence of SSI as superficial incisional, deep incisional, and organ/space as defined by The American College of Surgeons National Surg ical Quality 
Improvement Program (NSQIP) guidelines.  
 
• Assess (or compare) the length of hospital stay  between subjects who receive standard 
of care  and incisional NPWT  via PIMS or  ActiV.A.C .

5.1 STUDY DESCRIPTIO N 
This study is a multi- center, open- label, randomized clinical trial conducted at Duke Cancer 
Institute and Indiana University to evaluate whether incisional NPWT can help reduce the rate of 
SSI in patients undergoing either colorectal or hepatopancreatobiliary surgery. Up  to 170 subjects 
will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either conventional wound care (control group) or the incisional 
NPWT  (experimental group)  to ensure 138  evaluable subjects .  
 
The primary study endpoint will be SSI within the laparotomy wound, as assessed on 
postoperative day 4-5 and the first postoperative clinic visit, which is anticipated to be within 30 
days  of surgery . Evaluable subjects are defined as those who have been randomized and 
completed both postoperative assessments. Non-evaluable subjects are those subjects who were 
randomized but did not complete both post -op visits.  Non-evaluable scenarios include aborted 
surgeries , cancelled surgeries, death unrelated to study, and early device removal related to 
device malfunction. Screen failures are defined as those subjects not randomized.   
 
Safety endpoints will be adverse events  related to the device or dressing,  including  the presence 
of any abnormal skin findings (such as blisters or rash). These endpoints will be assessed from 
the day of surgery  through the 30- day follow -up visit .   
 
Subjects randomized to conventional wound care (control group) will have their skin incisi ons 
closed with skin staples , sutures , or surgical glue  (per judgment of the treating physic ian), covered 
with sterile medical gauze and a form of adherent (tape or clear adhesive) for which the subject 
does not have any allergy. This dressing will be removed per the treating physician’s discretion 
or institutional standards.  
 Subjects randomized to the incisional NPWT  (experimental group) will have their skin incisions 
closed with skin staples  or sutures  (per judgment of the treating physician) , a laye r of non-
adhesive dressing (Adaptic: Johnson & Johnson, New Brunswick, New Jersey) will cover the skin 
staples  or sutures, followed by placement of an adhesive (Benzoin: generic), a Prevena™ Incision 
Management System  peel and place or customizable dressing (KCI USA, Inc , San Antonio, 
Texas) covering only the skin staples  or sutures .  Please note , surgical glue should not be used 
for the experimental group. NPWT will be delivered using either the Prevena pump or the 
ActiV .AC. The incisional NPWT  will then be continued for a minimum of 2 days up to a maximum 
of 7 days depending on physician preference.   
 Subjects will be clinically managed according to routine standard of care. Subjects will be assessed during their inpatient stay and at the time of routine postoperative clinic visits  which is 
anticipated to be within 30 days of discharge. Presence or absence of SSI will be determined on postoperative day 4-5 and again at the time of the postoperative clinic visit, which is anticipated 
to be within 30 days of discharge.  Criteria for determination of SSI are listed in Section 8.  Patients who are candidates for a laparoscopic approach will not be recruited. Note: patients 
scheduled for a staging laparoscopy followed by an open procedure are permitted to participate.

8.0 CLASSIFICATION OF SSI BY NSQIP  
The following definitions will be used to classify  SSI: 
Superficial Incisional SSI: Superficial incisional SSI is an infection that occurs within 30 days 
after the operation and infection involves only skin or subcutaneous tissue of the incision and at 
least one of the following:  
- Purulent drainage, with or without laboratory confirmation, from the superficial incision.  
- Organisms isolated from an aseptically obtained culture of fluid or tissue from the

9.0 SUBJECT DISCONTINUATION 
Subjects may withdraw from this study at any time.   
 
Reason for discontinuation from the trial will be recorded.  
 The Principal Investigator may discontinue a subject from the protocol  regimen .  Reasons for 
subject discontinuation by the investigator may include but are not limited to the following:  
• Death 
• Investigator or PI determination that  it is not in the subject’s best interest to continue 
participation  
• Lost to follow -up 
10.0 STATISTICAL METHODS  
Administrative Summary  
Between July 2016 and June 2017, institutional SSI rates were 29% and 9% for Whipple 
procedures and liver resections, respectively.  Based on these lower than expected SSI rates we 
decided to compute the observed, overall infection rate among patients currently enrolled and 
treated on this trial  to assess whether the trial hypotheses were reasonable assumptions . The 
current overall infection rate was estimated to be 11%. In addition, t he observed percent  of 
ineligible/non- evaluable patients was 14%. Consequently, the null and alternative hypotheses of 
the present trial are being amended from the previous null and alternative hypotheses of 30% 
and 15%, respectively to 17% and 5%, respectively, to reflect the  overall, observed infection rate.  
The revised, maximum sample size will be inflated to reflect the observed percent  of inevaluable 
patients , 14% . As of February 2018, 131 patients were randomized; n o statistical analysis of the 
study endpoint has been conducted to date.  
 
Revised Statistical Considerations  
The primary study endpoint is SSI rate. Patients will be stratified by surgical  site (colorectal vs 
hepatopancreatobiliary) and BMI (<30 vs  ≥30), and randomly assigned to conventional wound 
care group or negative wound pressure group with 1:1 allocation. The hypothesiz ed SSI rate is 
17% for the conventional wound care group (control group)  [1].  We anticipate a reduction of the 
rate to 5% in the negative wound pressure group ( experimental group).   
 
As this is a phase II study, a larger type I error rate of 0.1 will be used. Based on a chi -square 
test comparing two- sample binomial probabilities at a 1 -sided significance level of 0.1, the study 
has approximately 85 % power to detect the difference in SSI rates between 17% in the control

patients  (based on the observed percentage of evaluable patients to date) , up to 170 patients ( 85 
per arm) will be enrolled.  Given that  143 patients have already enrolled on the study, up to 27 
additional patients will be accrued to meet the revised, maximum study sample size.    
 
With an accrual rate of 4 patients per month, we expect to complete the additional accrual in less 
than 8 month s. 
 Preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative variables will be prospectively collected.  
10.1 STATISTICAL ANALYSIS  
The primary analysis will include all randomized and evaluable patients but exclude ineligible patients or patients who are canceled from the study before receiving any wound care. SSI is 
defined as an infection that occurs within 30 days of operation. The primary endpoint is the SSI 
rate.  The primary analysis of comparing the conventional wound care (control group) and the 
incisional V.A.C® (experimental  group) will be conducted using a chi -square test for two- sample 
binomial probabilities with a one -sided significance level of 0.1. The observed SSI rate s and 90% 
Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) estimates will be reported. Preoperative, intraoperative, and 
postoperative variables will be tabulated and appropriate summary statistics will be reported. As 
a secondary analysis, comparison of treatment groups for SSI will be adjusted for any significant preoperative, intraoperative, or postoperative variables using logistic regression.  
 For secondary endpoints, t he incidence of SSI as superficial incisional, deep incisional, and 
organ/space will be estimat ed along with the 90% UCB s. The secondary endpoint length of stay 
is a continuous variable.  A Wilcoxon rank sum test will be used to assess the significance of the 
difference between groups in median length of stay. Median length of stay, its range and quartiles 
will be reported.  
 
11.0 INVESTIGATIONAL PRODUCT  
The P IMS and ActiV.A.C. therapy unit s and associated dressing s will be  supplied by KCI.  
 
Incisional NPWT  will be removed prior to hospital discharge.  
 
In the event that the clinician or study designee encounters issues with PIMS or  control dressings 
prior to the desired time for removal, dressing replacement/reinforcement  is acceptabl e but must 
be documented in the case report form (CRF).   The P IMS unit may also be switched to use an 
ActiV.A.C unit.   Any loss of negative pressure will be documented and will not determine subject 
evaluability. Please refer to the PIMS Instructions manual for guidance on operational questions . 
 
A PIMS  canister filled with 45 mL of wound fluid will lead to a “canister full”  alarm.

Page 18  of 23  will conduct routine monitoring after the third subject is enrolled, followed by annual monitoring of 
1 – 3 subjects until the study is closed to enrollment and subjects are no longer receiving study 
interventions that are more than minimal risk.   
 
Additional monitoring may be prompted by findings from monitoring visits, unexpected frequency 
of serious and/or unexpected toxicities, or other concerns and may be initiated upon request of DUHS and DCI leadership, the DCI Cancer Protocol Committee, the Safety Oversight Committee 
(SOC), the funding source, the Principal Investigator, or the IRB.  All study documents must be  
made available upon request to the DCI Monitoring Team , the Duke School of Medicine Office of 
Regulatory Affairs and Quality (ORAQ)  and other authorized regulatory authorities, including but 
not limited to the National Institute of Health, National Cancer  Institute, and the FDA.  Every 
reasonable effort will be made to maintain confidentiality during study monitoring.
 
13.2 SAFETY OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE  
The Duke Cancer Institute SOC is responsible for annual data and safety monitoring of DUHS sponsor -investigator phase I and II, therapeutic interventional studies that do not have an 
independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB). The primary focus of the SOC is review of 
safety data, toxicities and new information that may affect subject safety or efficacy. Annual safety 
reviews include but may not be limited to review of safety data, enrollment status, stopping rules 
if applicable, accrual, toxicities, reference literature, and interim analyses as provided by the sponsor -investigator. The SOC in concert with the DCI Monitoring Team oversees the conduct of 
DUHS cancer -related, sponsor -investigator therapeutic intervention and prevention intervention 
studies that do not have an external monitoring plan, ensuring subject safety and that the protocol 
is conducted, recorded and reported in accordance with the protocol, standing operating 
procedures (SOPs), Good Clinical Practice (GCP), and applicable regulatory  requirements.
 
13.3 SUBJECT CONFIDENTIA LITY  
In order to maintain subject privacy, all case report forms (CRFs), study drug accountability 
records, study reports, and communications will identify the subjects by initials or the assigned 
subject number.  The investigator will grant monitor(s) and audi tor(s) from the funding source , or 
designee and regulatory authority(ies) access to subject original medical records for verification of data gathered on the CRFs and to monitor/audit the data collection process.  The subject’s 
confidentiality will be maintained and will not be made publicly available to the extent permitted 
by the applicable laws and regulations. 
13.4 INVESTIGATOR COMPLI ANCE  
The investigator will conduct the study in compliance with the protocol provided by the sponsor 
and funding source  and will obtain approval by the IRB and appropriate regulatory authority(ies).  
Modifications to the protocol should not be made without agreement of the investigator and funding source. Changes to the protocol will require written IRB approval prior to the  
implementation, except when the modification is needed to eliminate an immediate hazard(s) to 
subjects.  If applicable regulatory authority(ies) permit, the IRB may provide expedited review and 
approval for minor changes in ongoing studies that have the approval of the IRB. Sponsor or 
designee will submit all protocol modifications to the regulatory authority(ies) in accordance with 
the governing regulations.

Page 19  of 23  When immediate deviation from the protocol is required to eliminate an immediate hazard(s) to 
subjects, the investigator will contact the funding source or designee, if circumstances permit, to 
discuss the planned course of action.  All departures from the protocol must be fully documented.  
13.5 AUDITS  
The Duke School of Medicine Office of Regulatory Affairs and Quality (ORAQ)  may conduct audits 
to evaluate compliance with the protocol and the principles of GCP. The PI agrees to allow the 
ORAQ  auditor(s) direct access to all relevant documents and to allocate his/her time and the time 
of the study team to the ORAQ auditor(s) in order to discuss findings and any relevant issues. 
 
ORAQ  audits are designed to protect the rights and well- being of hu man research subjects. 
ORAQ  audits may be routine or directed (for cause). Routine audits are selected based upon risk 
metrics generally geared towards high subject enrollment, studies with limited oversight or 
monitoring, Investigator initiated Investigational Drugs or Devices, federally -funded studies, high 
degree of risk (based upon adverse events, type of study, or vulnerable populations), Phase I 
studies, or studies that involve Medicare populations. Directed audits occur at the directive of the 
IRB or  an authorized Institutional Official.  
 
ORAQ  audits examine research studies/clinical trials methodology, processes and systems to 
assess whether the research is conducted according to the protocol approved by the DUHS IRB. 
The primary purpose of the audit/review is to verify that the standards for safety of human subjects 
in clinical trials and the quality of data produced by the clinical trial research are met. The 
audit/review will serve as a quality assurance measure, internal to the institution. Additional goals 
of such audits are to detect both random and systemic errors occurring during the conduct of 
clinical research and to emphasize “best practices” in the research/clinical trials environment.  
 
14.0 DATA MANAGEMENT AND PROCE SSING 
A Medidata Rave database will be the data collection tool for the study.   
 
An audit trail is  maintained automatically by the electronic CRF management system .  All users 
of this system will complete user training . 
14.1 STUDY DOCUMENTATION  
Study documentation includes but is not limited to source documents, case report forms, monitoring logs, appointment schedules, study team correspondence with sponsors , funding 
source  or regulatory bodies/committees, and regulatory documents that can be found in the DCI -
mandated “Regulatory Binder”, which includes but is not limited to signed protocol and amendments, approved and signed informed consent forms, FDA Form 1572, CAP and CLIA 
laboratory certifications, and clinical supplies receipts and distribution records.

COMMITTEE  
The protocol, informed consent form  and pertinent  protocol -related documents must be submitted 
to the DUHS Institutional Review Board (IRB) and DCI Cancer Protocol Committee (CPC) for review. The study may be initiated only after the Principal Investigator has received written and 
dated approval from the CPC and IRB.  
 
The Principal Investigator must submit and obtain approval from the IRB for all subsequent 
protocol amendments and changes to the informed consent form. The CPC should be informed 
about any protocol amendments that potentially affect research design or data analysis (i.e. 
amendments affecting subject population, inclusion/exclusion criteria, agent administration, statistical analysis, etc.).  
 
The Principal Investigator must obtain protocol re- approval from the IRB within 1 year of the most 
recent IRB approval. The Principal Investigator must also obtain protocol re -approval from the 
CPC within 1 year of the most recent IRB approval, for as long as the protocol remains open to subject enrollment.  
15.3 INFORMED CONSENT  
The informed consent form must be written in a manner that is understandable to the subject 
population. Prior to its use, the informed consent form must be approved by the IRB.  
 
The Principal Investigator or authorized key personnel will discuss with the potential subject the purpose of the research, methods, potential risks and benefits, subject concerns, and other study -
related matters. This discussion will occur in a location that ensures subject privacy and in a manner that minimizes the possibility of coercion. Potential subjects will have the opportunity to 
contact the Principal investigator or authorized key personnel with questions, and will be given as 
much time as needed to make an informed decision about participation in the study.  
 
Before conducting any study -specific pro cedures, the Principal Investigator must obtain written 
informed consent from the subject or a legally acceptable representative.  The original informed 
consent form will be stored with the subject’s study records, and a copy of the informed consent

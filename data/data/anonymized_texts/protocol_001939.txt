Protocol Title:  An Open -label, Single -arm Study t o Characterize the Pharmacodynamics and 
Safety  of Repeat Dose  SP-102 (Dexamethasone Sodium
 Phosphate Injectable Gel) 
Administered by Epidural Injection in Subjects with Lumbosacral Radicu lopathy  
Protocol Number:  SP-102-03 
Study Center(s):  Up to 2 
Phase of Development:  2 
Objectives:  The primary  objective of the study is to characterize repeat dose 
pharmacodynamics (PD) of SP -102 (10 mg dexamethasone) a
dministered by 
epidural inj
ection with respect to hypothalamic- pituitary -adrenal (HPA) 
suppression using plasma cortisol levels, white blood cell cou nt (WBC), and blood 
glucose.  
The secondary  objecti
ves of the study are to : 
• Evaluate the safety and tolerability of single and repeat dose SP -102 
(10 mg dexamethasone) administered by epidural injection in subjects 
with lumbosacra
l radiculopathy.  
• Evaluate the anal
gesic effect on leg pain (as measured by the Numeric 
Pain Rating Scale [ NPRS ] in the affected leg ) following the  index 
(Treatment [T] 1)  and repeat (T2) injection s. 
Study Design:  This is an open -label, singl e-arm, repeat dose study to characterize the PD and 
safety/tolerability of SP -102 (10 mg dexamethasone
) administered by epidural 
inject
ion as transforaminal (TF) or int erlaminar (IL) injection  under fluoroscopic 
guidance in subjects with lumbosacral radiculopathy.   
Subjects meeting the eligibility criteria will be enrolled in the study and receive  a 
single 2 -mL epidural injection of SP- 102 (10 mg dexamethason
e) in T1 (index 
injection ) an
d T2 (repeat injection ), separated by 4 to 8 weeks.  T2 will only be 
provided if a repeat injection is warrante d and the subject continues to meet 
applicable study inclusion and exclusion criteria.  
Subjects who have 
been using opioids other than high dose opioids within 30 days 
prior to Screening (see Exclusion #12 ), may participate in the study  if they agree to 
discontinue the opioid therapy prior to the Screening Visit and sign the 
pre-scree ning informed consent form .  
The study will include a 21 -day screening per iod (Visit 1) , sequential treatments 
periods T1 and T2 , separated by 4 to 8 weeks ; each treatment peri od will consist of 
a Baseline Visit (Day 0), SP -102 injection  (Day 1), and  a 4-week follow -up period .  
Screening, Baseline, and follow -up visits will occur at the research site.   Subject s 
will stay i
n a restricted environment ) for each of 5 nights beginning the 
night before each injection  to ensure fasting each evening and on -time collection of 
PD assessments each morning .  Subjects will be permitted to leave the restricted 
environment ) and resume normal activities each day after study  
procedures are performed.  The SP -102 injection will be administered in an 
injection pr
ocedure facility.  Safety and PD assessments will be  collected at 
Screening, pre -dose, daily for 4  days post  dose during the stay in the restricted 
environment ( ), and at 3  outpatient follow -up visits (on Day  8, Day  15, and 
Day 28) after each injection.  The end of study (EOS) visit (Visit  19) is the final 
outpatient visit after the second injection .  If the subject is not eligible for T2 or 
chooses to withdraw from further participation  in the study , the subject will be 
scheduled for the EOS visit (Visit 19).  
From the time of 
informed consent to the EOS visit, each subject’s participation 
may last up to 15  weeks.

Endpoints : • Dexamethasone- induced HPA suppression as measured by: 
o Observed total blood cortisol levels, change from baseline 
cortisol levels, and percent change from baseline cortisol levels  
o Observed glucose levels, change from baseline glucose levels, and percent change from baseline glucose levels  
o Observed white blood cell counts, change from baseline white blood cell counts, and percent change from baseline white blood cell counts  
• NPRS (average leg pain and back pain) and BPI -SF  
• Change from T1 Day 0 and T2 Day 0 through Day 28 in NPRS (average leg pain and back pain) and BPI -SF over time following the index (T1) 
and repeat (T2) epidural injections, respectively  
• Percent change from T1 Day 0 and T2 Day 0 through Day 28 in NPRS 
(average leg pain and back pain) and BPI -SF following the index (T1) and 
repeat (T2) epidural injections, respectively  
Safety Endpoints:  Safety endpoints are as follows:  
• Incidence of treatment -emergent AEs (TEAEs) and serious adverse events  
(SAEs)  
• Change from baseline in clinical laboratory parameters, vital sign 
measurements , ECG  findings, and physical examination parameters 
following each treatment   
Statistical Analyses:  No formal statistical power calculation was performed for this study; the sample size is based on clinical and practical considerations.  
TEAEs and SAEs, observed values and changes in clinical laboratory parameters, 
and vital signs will be summarized descriptively for each treatment.  Shifts in 
laboratory parameters , physical examination findings , general neurological 
examination findings, and targeted neurological examination findings will be 
summarized by treatment group.  
Unless otherwise specified, baseline is defined as the last non -missing 
measurement taken prior to treatments T1 or T2 (reference start date).  This 
includes screening or unscheduled assessments that would have been performed no earlier than 21 days before the reference start date.  
In the case where the last  non-missing measurement and the reference start date 
coincide, that measurement will be considered pre- reference, but AEs and 
medications commencing on the reference start date will be considered post-reference.  
Cortisol levels, WBC counts, and fasting blood glucose levels (observed, change 
from baseline, and percent change from baseline) will be summarized by treatment 
and measurement time using descriptive statistics.  Dexamethasone- induced HPA 
suppression will be evaluated by using the observed total pl asma cortisol level, 
glucose levels, and WBC count.  Other PD analyses may be performed as 
appropriate .  
For blood cortisol and glucose levels, and WBC counts (change ‐from ‐baseline), PD 
parameters, ie, area under the effect curve over 28 days (AUEC
28 days ) and 
maximum effect (E max) following the T1 (index) and T2 (repeat) injections  will be 
calculated.   
AUEC 28 days  is defined as the change from baseline (for cortisol,  glucose, and 
WBC) and calculated using linear trapezoidal summation from pre -dose to Day 28 
in each treatment period.  E max is the baseline -adjusted maximum increase in 
Semnur Pharmaceuticals, Inc.   Protocol SP-102-03 
  Version 1.0, 08 Jun  2018 
 
Confidential  Page 8 of 85 glucose level and WBC count or the maximum decrease in cortisol levels over the 
28 days post dose in each treatment period.  
The PD parameters will be analyzed using a mixed model analysis of variance 
using PROC MIXED with a fixed effect for treatment and a random effect for 
subject.  Estimates and 90% confidence intervals (CIs) will be fir st constructed in 
the logarithmic scale.  By taking anti- logarithms, estimates and CIs for the 
geometric means and ratios of geometric means will be calculated.  All CIs will be 2-sided.  
A lack of effect of repeat injection on the PD will be concluded if the 90% CIs for 
the ratio of T2 (repeat injection; Test) to T1 (index; Reference) for both AUEC
28 days  and E max are completely contained within the range of 80 to 125%.  
The pain assessment closest to and prior to dosing in each treatment period will be used as baseline for each treatment period.  The following pain -score endpoints 
will be summarized over time by treatment using descriptive statistics:  
• NPRS  (average leg pain and back pain) and BPI -SF  
• Change from T1 Day 0 and T2 Day 0 through Day 28 in NPRS (average 
leg pain and back pain) and BPI -SF over time following the index (T1) 
and repeat (T2) epidural injections, respectively  
• Percent change from T1 Day 0 and T2 Day 0 through Day 28 in NPRS (average leg pain and back pain) and BPI -SF following the ind ex (T1) and 
repeat (T2) epidural injections, respectively

1.1 Background 
1.1.1 Lumbosacral Radicul ar Pain  
Back pain is a widespread, debilitating disorder that results in an enormous socioeconomic 
burden.  The lifetime prevalence of low back pain ranges from 60% to 90%, a nd the annual 
incidence is ~5%  (Frymoyer-1988, Frymoyer-1992).   The annual cost to treat back pain has been 
estimated to exceed $100  billion, of which it is estimated that up to $50 billion is due to lost 
productivity ( Cleeland -1989) .   
A specific type of back pain in the distribution of lumbosacral nerves is known as lumbosacral 
radicular pain, which is frequently referred to as sciatica .  It is a common condition with a 
lifetime inc idence varying from 13% to 40% (Stafford -2007) .  The corresponding annual 
incidence of an episode of lumbosacral radi cular pain ranges from 1% to 5% (Frymoyer-1988, 
Frymoyer-1992).   It is rarely diagnosed before the age of 20, peaks in incidence in the fifth 
decade of life and declines thereafter  (Frymoyer-1992) .   
Lumbosacral radicular pain  is believed to result most commonly from prolapsed disc material 
causing pain secondary to mechanical impingement and/or inflammation of the anterior primary rami of lumbar nerve roots .  Histological changes have been first described in 1951 
(Lindahl-1951).   Approximately 90% of cases of lumbosacral radicular pain are caused by a 
herniated disc with nerve root compression, with various other etiologies accounting for the remaining 10% of the cases ( Stafford -2007, Valat -2010) .  
There are several conservative treatments for lumbosacral radicular pain, each with varying levels of effectiveness.  These therapeutic approaches include bed rest, staying active (in contrast 
to bed rest), analgesic or non- steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), acupuncture, spinal 
manipulations, traction therapy, physical therapy, behavioral treatment, and epidural steroid injections  (ESIs) ( Frymoyer-1992, Koes -2007, Valat -2010) .  The initial phase of sciatica 
frequently responds to conservative management with no intervention.  For example, in a study 
of more than 208 subjects with obvious symptoms and signs of a lumbosacral radicular pain  
(5
th lumbar vertebra and 1st sacral vertebra), treated with nonsteroidal anti -inflammatory drug 
piroxicam or placebo, 70% in active group reported a marked reduction in back and leg pain and improved functionality within 4 weeks and 60% had returned to work at that point in time.  
However, approximately 30% of subjects in both groups still complained of back pain and 19.5% were out of work after 1 year  (Weber -1993) .  When these more conservative treatments for 
lumbosacral radicular pain are ineffective, ESIs  or surgical interventions are commonly used. 
Epidural cocaine injections were reported as early as 19 01 via the sacral hiatus for lumbosacral 
radicular pain  (Nelson -2001) .  In the 1950s, physicians began injecting corticosteroids into the 
epidural and extradural space as a treatment for lumbosacral radicular pain  (Barry -1962, 
Benzon-2015) .  
1.1.2 Epidural Steroids  
The first controlled trial evaluating ESIs was performed in 1970  (Sullivan -1995)  and since then 
there have been many controlled trials evaluating the effectiveness of different corticosteroids injected into the epidural space for the treatment of radicular pain .  Despite differences in 
injection route, anatomical region of injection, control group, injectate characteristics, and 
Semnur Pharmaceuticals, Inc.   Protocol SP-102-03 
  Version 1.0, 08 Jun  2018 
 
Confidential  Page 19 of 85 individual  pathology, the clinical consensus across multiple practice specialties is that ESI s 
provides at least short -term benefit in selected people ( Cohen-2013) .   
The mechanisms by which steroids exert their analgesic effects have been debated, but it is 
established that corticosteroids inhibit phospholipase A2, which catalytically hydrolyzes the 
bond converting membrane phospholipids into arachidonic acid and lysophospholipids 
(Cohen-2013) .  In addition to the anti- inflammatory effects, steroids may also inhibit pain via 
their ability to suppress ectopic discharges from injured nerve fibers and depress conduction in 
normal unmyelinated C fibers  (Devor -1985, Johansson-1990) .  Epidural steroids are now 
considered a standard treatment regimen for lumbosacral radicular pain  (Cohen-2013) .  The 
comparative effectiveness of the various treatment modalities has been a to pic that has been 
frequently addressed in the literature, but there is currently no United States (US) Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA)- approved epidural steroid treatment for lumbosacral radicular pain.  
Epidural injection of corticosteroids is a common procedure performed in the US for the management of lumbar radicular pain caused by disc herniations.  They have been shown 
effective in reducing pain, restoring function, reducing the need for other hea lth care, and 
avoiding surgery ( MacVicar -2013) .  Recent review of randomized controlled clinical trials  using 
ESIs for treatment of radicular pain demonstrate Level II clinical evidence of long -term benefits  
(Kaye -2015) .  ESIs are relatively safe pr ocedures, containing lower risks than opioid therapy 
(Cohen-2013) .  
Because injectable corticosteroids are not FDA ‐approved for this route of administration, the 
epidural injection of corticosteroids is considered an off ‐label use of approved injectable steroid 
formulations.   
In 2009, the FDA began evaluating serious neurologic events associated with epidural 
glucocorticoid injections.  Between 1997 and 2014, a total of 90 serious and sometimes fatal 
neurologic events were reported to the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS), 
including cases of paraplegia, quadriplegia, spinal cord infarction, and stroke.  There is concern that in glucocorticoids formulated as suspensions rather than solutions, particulate matter may 
pose an increased risk of embolism after inadvertent intravascular injection .  All catastrophic 
events (those resulting in permanent disability or death) reported to FAERS were associated with 
injection of a suspension, whereas only a few cases involving tempor ary symptoms were 
reported with glucocorticoid solutions ( Racoosin -2015).   In 2014, the FDA issued a requirement 
that all injectable glucocorticoid product labels carry a warning stating that “serious neurologic events, some resulting in death, have been reported with epidural injection of corticosteroids” 
and that the “safety and effectiveness of epidural administration of corticosteroids have not been 
established and corticosteroids are not approved for this use”  (Food and Drug 
Administration -2014) . 
The Anesthetic and Analgesic Drug Products Advisory Committee held a meeting on November 24‐ 25, 2014 to disc
uss the risk of serious neurologic adverse reactions associated with 
ESIs administered to reduce inflammation for pain management.  The Committee considered the 
efficacy of ESI and the overall risk ‐benefit balance of injecting steroids in the epidural space to 
treat pain .  The committee acknowledged the benefits of ESIs.  The safety concerns are related to 
particulate -containing formulations leading to 131 neurologic al adverse events (AEs) , including 
41 cases of arachnoidit
is, identified by  the FDA, and 700 cases of fungal meningitis following

3.1 Overall Study Design and Plan   
This is an open -label, single- arm, repeat dose study to characterize the PD and safety/tolerability 
of SP -102 (10 mg dexamethasone) administered by TF or IL injection under fluoroscopic 
guidance in subject
s with lumbosacral radiculopathy.  
Subjects meeting the eligibility criteria will be enrolled in the study and receive a single 2 -mL 
epidural injection
 of SP -102 ( 10 mg dexamethasone)
 in T1 (index injection) and T2 (repeat 
injection ), separat
ed by 4 to 8 weeks.  T2 will only be provided if a repeat injection is warranted 
and the subject continues to meet applicable study inclusion and exclusion criteria. 
Subjects who have bee
n using opioids other than high dose opioids within 30 days prior to 
Screening (see Exclusion #12), may participate in the study if they agree to discontinue the 
opioid therapy prior to the S creening Visit and sign the pre -screening informed consent form 
(ICF).  
The study will include a 21-day screening period (Visit 1), sequential treatments periods T1 and T2, separated by 4 to 8 weeks ; each treatment period will co nsist of a Baseline Visit (Day 0), 
SP-102 injection (Day 1), and a 4 -week follow-up period.  Screening, Baseline, and follow-up 
visits will occur at the research site.   Subjects will stay in a restricted environment ( ) for 
each of 5 nights beginning the night before each injection to ensure fasting each evening and on-
time collection of PD assessments each morning .  Subjects will be permitted to leave the 
restricted environment ) and resume normal activities each day after study procedures are performed.  The SP- 102 injection will be administered in an injection procedure facility .  
Safety and PD assessments will be  collected at Screening, pre-dose, daily for 4 days post dose 
during the stay in the restricted environment ( ), and a t 3 outpatient follow -up visits (on 
Day 8, Day 15, and Day 28) after each injection.  The end of study (EOS) visit (Visit 19) is the 
final outpatient visit after the second injection.  If the subject is not eligible for T2 or chooses to 
withdraw from further participation  in the study, the subject will be scheduled for the EOS visit 
(Visit 19).

subject safety, prevent study completion, and/or to have a confounding effect on outcome 
measures. 
3.3.3 Stopping Rules  
A single occurrence of an adverse event of special interest (AESI) (Section  4.2.2)  precludes the 
subject from receiving a repeat injection.  Three occurrences of the AESI of the same type across the study will trigger stopping of all further dosing until implementation of a safety review.  
3.3.4 Removal of Subject s from Therapy or Assessment  
A subject  will be considered to have completed the study when he or she completes the 
Visit 19 (End of Study [E OS]/Early Termination [ ET]) visit.  If a subject is discontinued at any 
time after rando mization into  the study, the investigator will make every effort to follow the 
subject and complete the  EOS /ET assessments as shown in Section  3.5.1.  Enrollment will 
continue until 12 subjects have each completed two SP-102 injections (T1 and T2).   
A termination electronic Case Report Form (eCRF) page should be completed for every subject 
who receives IP, whether the subject  completes the study  or not.  The reason for any early 
discontinuation should be indicated on this form .  The primary reason for a subject  discontinuing 
early  should be selected from the following standard categories of ET: 
• Adverse Event : Clinical or laboratory events occurred that, in the medical judgment of the 
investigator for the best int erest of the subject, are grounds for discontinuation.  This 
includes SAEs , nonserious AEs, and AESI s regardless of relation to the IP. 
• Death: The subject died. 
• Withdrawal of Consent : The subject desired to withdraw from further participation in the 
study in the absence of an investigator- determined medical need to withdraw .  If the 
subject gave a reason for withdrawing, it should be recorded in the eCRF. 
• Protocol Violation : The subject’s findings or conduct failed to meet the protocol entry 
criteria or failed to adhere to the protocol requirements (eg, drug noncompliance, failure 
to return for defined number of visits).  The violation necessitated early discontinued 
from the study. 
• Lost to Follow- Up: The subject stopped coming for visits and study personnel were 
unable to contact the subject .

3.5.3 Assessments for 
Early  Termination  
If the subject’s participation in the study is terminated prematurely for any reason , the reason for 
such ET should be documented and the Visit 19 /EOS/ET procedures should be performed.  If the 
ET occurs prior to Visit  10, the subject should be encouraged to continue in the study until 
Visit 10, if possible.  Subjects who do not receive both T1 and T2 will be discontinued from the 
study and the Visit 19/EOS/ET procedures should be performed.  In case of  ET, the subject 
should be encouraged to return to the site for ET procedures, or failing a return visit, a telephone 
visit should be arranged to encourage the subject to complete the Visit 19/EOS/ET procedures 
(Section 3.5.2.13).  
An EOS  eCRF page should be completed for every subject who receives IP , whether the subject 
completes the study  or not .  The reason for  any ET should be indicated on this form.  The primary 
reason for the ET should be selected as noted in Section 3.3.4.  
3.5.4 Pharmacodynamic Assessments  
3.5.4.1 Cortisol 
Blood is collected to measure the level of the hormone cortisol in the blood, which may indicate 
problems with the adrenal glands or pituitary gland.  Ideally, this test should be perform ed at 
8 am  after at least a 10 -hour fast; this is not required at Screening.  Cortisol will be measured 
from blood samples c ollected at Screening, Visit 3 through Visit 10, and Visit 12 through 
Visit 19.  NOTE: The Screening test result is to be compared to the local laboratory normal range 
for cortisol daily variation.  
3.5.4.2 Glucose  
A glucose level measures the amount of sugar circu lating in the blood.  Accurate levels of 
glucose are measured from blood obtained in a fasting state ; therefore, the subject will undergo 
at least a 10 -hour fast prior to this being tested at 8 am ; this is not required at Screening .  
Glucose will be measur ed at Screening, Visit 3 through Visit 10, and Visit 12 through Visit 19.  
NOTE: The Screening test result is to be compared to the local laboratory normal range for 
non-fasted glucose.

at Screening, Visit 3 through Visit 10, and Visit 12 through Visit 19. 
3.5.4.4 Numeric Pain Rating Scale   
The NPRS  (Appendix E ) is an 11-point scale (0 to 10-point scale where 0 is no pain and 10 is 
worst pain imaginable ) that allows the subject to rate the severity of their pain intensity at 
various points in time  (Turk -2003) .  The subject will use the NPRS to record their current  pain , 
average pain in the past 24 hours, and worst pain in the past 24 hours for both their affected 
leg(s) and back pain .  The NPRS will be collected at each study visit.  
3.5.4.5 Brief Pain Inventory  - Short Form  
The BPI -SF (Appendix F ) is a 15 -item self- rating scale assessing use of medications, as well as 
sensory, and reactive components of pain.  The BPI- SF includes items that will address 
components of sensory pain, including severity, location, chronicity, and degree of relief due to 
therapy.  The BPI- SF also has items that address reactive pain components, including depression, 
suffering, and perceived availability of relief.  Respectable reliability has been demonstrated over short intervals using test- retest correlation; worst pain, r=0.93; usual pain, r=0.78; p ain now, 
r=0.59.  The BPI- SF will be collected all  study visit s except Screening . 
3.5.5 Safety Assessments  
3.5.5.1 Physical Examination  
A complete physical examination, including examination of general appearance, skin, neck, eyes, ears, nose, throat, heart, lungs, abdomen, lymph nodes, extremities, and musculoskeletal  system, 
will be performed at Screening .  The Screening physical examination will also include an 
assessment of lumbosacral radiculopathy.  Specific musculoskeletal examination focusing on 
lumbar spine and lower extremities to exclude musculoskeletal sources of the predominant pain, 
such as SI joints and trigger points, will be performed in standardized manner and recorded.  A 
physical examination will be done at Screening, T1 – Day 0, T1 – Day 28, and T2 – Day 28 (Visit 19/EOS/ET).  
3.5.5.2 General Neurological and Targeted Neurological Examination s:  
A general neurological examination will include evaluation of mental status (awareness of person, place, and time), cranial nerves, motor function and balance, sensory exam (ability to feel), and reflexes.  A targeted neurological examination focusing on signs and symptoms of 
lumbosacral radiculopathy, including straight leg raise test, will be performed according to the checklist (see Appendix G ).  Both general and targeted neurological exams are to be performed 
by the same trained clinician throughout the study, if possible.  Training for conducting 
examination will be available on video.  General and targeted neurological examinations will be 
performed pre -dose and post dose on T 1 – Day  1, pre-dose and post dose on T2 – Day 1 , and on 
T2 – Day 28 (Visit 19/EOS/ET).

Vital signs will include systolic and diastolic BP and heart rate.  During the us ual clinic visits, 
the subject is to be seated for approximately 3 min before vital signs are recorded.  During the 
injection procedure, the vital signs will need to be collected while the subject is in prone position 
on the fluoroscopy table.  Vital signs  will be recorded at each clinic visit and will be monitored  
within 15 min prior to the procedure, approximately every 5 min during the procedure ( prior to 
syringe removal ), and approximately every 15 min after for 60 min after the procedure.  Height

prior to the index and repeat injection, if deemed necessary by the Investigator . 
Urinalysis:  Dipstick analysis: color, turbidity, specific gravity, pH, glucose, protein, 
ketones, urobilinogen, bilirubin, blood nitrate, leukocyte esterase, and microscopic examination when indicated by dipstick results. 
Urine drug screen:  Includes opiates, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, tricyclic 
antidepressants, cannabinoids, PCP , cocaine, ecstasy, and amphetamines.  A urine drug 
screen will be obtained at Screening, Baseline, and T1 – Day 28.  A urine drug screen 
may be repeated if deemed necessary by the Investigator.   
WOCBP : Serum pregnancy test at Screening .  Urine pregnancy test at Baseline and at 
Visit 11 (T2 – Day 0).  A urine pregnancy test may be repeated if deemed necessary by 
the Investigator.  
Laboratory samples will be analyzed by the local laboratory .  In the event of an unexplained 
clinically noteworthy abnormal laboratory test value, the test should be repeated immediately

Throughout the course of the study, after signing the ICF, all AEs will be monitored and 
recorde d on an AE eCRF, including the AE ’s description, start and end date, seriousness, 
severity, action taken, and relationship to the IP.  If AEs occur, the first concern will be the 
safety of the study subjects.  All AEs will be followed until reso lved or stable and the outcome 
documented on the eCRF. 
4.1 Definitions and Criteria  
4.1.1 Adverse Events  
An AE is a ny untoward medical occurrence in a subject or clinical investigation subject  
administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal 
relationship with this treatment ( ICH- E2A-1994).   An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and 
unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease 
temporally associated w ith the use of a medicinal product, whether considered related to the 
medicinal product or not. 
Medical interventions such as surgeries, diagnostic procedures, and therapeutic procedures are 
not AEs,  but the action taken to treat the medical condition.  They should be recorded as 
treatment of the AEs.  
4.1.2 Serious Adverse Events 
A serious adverse event (SAE) or reaction is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
• Results in death  
• Is life -threatening 
• Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  
• Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
• Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect 
• Is an important medical event (eg, intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias, or convulsions that do not result in 
hospitalization; or development of drug dependency or drug abuse; malignancy tumors [histological ly different from primary tumor] ) 
Note: The term “life -threatening” in the definition of “serious” refers to an event in which the 
subject was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event that hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe .   
Medical and scientific judgment  should be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporti ng is 
appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization  but may jeopardize the subject or may require 
intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes liste d in the definition above .  These should 
also usually be considered serious. 
Semnur Pharmaceuticals, Inc.   Protocol SP-102-03 
  Version 1.0, 08 Jun  2018 
 
Confidential  Page 52 of 85 Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic 
bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias, or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization; or 
development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 
Seriousness (not severity) serves as a guide for defining regulatory reporting obligations.  An 
SAE is not necessarily severe; eg, an overnight hospitalization for a diagnostic procedure must 
be reported as an SAE even though the occurrence is not medically serious.  By the same token, 
a severe AE is not necessarily serious: nausea of several hours’ duration may be rated as severe 
but may not be considered serious. 
4.1.3 Unexpected Adverse Drug Reactions 
An unexpected adverse drug reaction (ADR) is a reaction for which the nature or severity is not 
consistent with the applicable product information ( IB, SP102 -IB-2017) .  Until product 
information is amended, expedited reporting is required for additional occurrences of the reaction .  Reports that add significant information on specificity or severity of a known, already 
documented SAE constitute unexpected events.  For example, an event more specific or more 
severe than described in the IB would be considered “unexpected.”  Specific examples would be 
(a) acute renal failure as a labeled ADR with a subsequent new report of interstitial nephritis and 
(b) hepatitis with a first report of fulminant hepatitis.  
Guidance on reporting AEs and SAEs is described in Section  4.2. 
4.1.4 Abnormal Laboratory Values 
Any abnormality ( Appendix H ) in a laboratory value that is new in onset or which has worsened 
in severity or frequency from the baseline condition and meets 1 of the following criteria will be recorded on the AE pages of the eCRF: 
• Requires therapeutic intervention or diagnostic tests 
• Leads to discontinuation of IP  
• Has accompanying or inducing symptoms or signs 
• Is judged by the investigator as clinically significant  
4.1.5 Assessing Intensity and Relationship  
All AEs will be assessed on 2 descriptive parameters: intensity and relationship to  the IP: 
• Intensity refers to the severity of an event and references impact on a subject’s 
functioning. 
• Relationship refers to the likelihood that the event being assessed was caused by the IP. 
Intensity  
Each AE will be classified according to Appendix H . 
When changes in the intensity of an AE occur more frequently than once a day, the maximum 
intensity for the experience should be noted.  If the intensity category changes over a number of 
days, those changes should be recorded separately (with distinct onset dates).

Confidential  Page 53 of 85 Relationship  
Each AE will be assessed as to its relationship to the IP, based on the following criteria.  
Although the attribution by the investigator will be collected for reported events, for analytic 
purposes a temporal association with the use of  the IP  will be assumed sufficient for at least  
plausible association.  
Investigators are required to assess the causal relationship (ie, whether there is reasonable possibility that the study drug caused the event) using the following definitions: 
Unrelated:  A clinical event, including laboratory te st abnormality, with a temporal 
relationship to study drug administration that makes a causal relationship 
improbable, and/or in which other drugs, chemicals or underlying disease 
provide plausible explanations of the event. 
Possibly Related:  A clinical event , including laboratory test abnormality, with a reasonable 
time sequence to administration of the study drug, but that could also be 
explained by concurrent disease or other drugs or chemicals.  Information on study drug causality may be lacking or unclear. 
Probably Related: A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a reasonable time sequence to administration of the study drug, unlikely to be attributed 
to concurrent disease or other drugs or chemicals, and that follows a clinically rea sonable response on re- administration (rechallenge) or 
withdrawal (dechallenge) of the study drug. 
Definitely Related:  A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a temporal relationship to study drug administration that makes a causal relationship 
definite and is clearly related to use of the IP. 
When assessing the relationship to the IP, the following criteria will be considered:  
• Positive rechallenge  
• Positive dechallenge (resolution upon stopping suspect the IP , in absence of other 
intervention or treatment) 
• Known class effect  
• Biological plausibility  
• Lack of alternative explanation—concomitant drug or disease 
4.2 Reporting Procedures and Requirements  
4.2.1 Adverse Events  
AEs occurring after  the subject signs the ICF until the 30 days after the la st study visit will be 
recorded .  Any AEs occurring before  the start of treatment (ie, before the first dose of the IP)” 
will be recorded in the medical history .  Also, the sign, symptom, or disease present before 
starting the treatment period are only considered AEs if they worsen after starting the treatment 
period. 
Semnur Pharmaceuticals, Inc.   Protocol SP-102-03 
  Version 1.0, 08 Jun  2018 
 
Confidential  Page 55 of 85   
All recorded S
AEs, regardless of relationship to study treatment , will be followe d up until 
resolution, stabilization, or the subject is lost to follow -up and cannot be contacted.  In 
circumstances where the Investigator is unable to contact the subject, the Investigator must 
provide a written statement to Semnur  confirming that the subject is lost to follow -up.  SAEs  that 
are ongoing at EOS  should be followed until resolved. 
Additional follow-up information must be reported in the eCRF within 24 hours of awareness following Investig
ator (or site) awareness of the information.   The Investigator should not delay 
reporting an SAE to obtain additional information.  Additional information, when available, 
should be reported to  by the reporting procedures described 
above. 
If the investig
ator detects an SAE in a stu dy subject within 30 days after the last scheduled  study 
visit, and considers the SAE  related or possibly related to prior study treatment, the investigator 
should report it to sponsor/  
The sponsor or its 
representative will be responsible for determining and in turn, reporting SAEs 
to regulatory authorities per the applicable regulatory requirements. 
4.3 Procedures for Documenting Pregnancy d uring the Study  
Pregnancy occurring in a female subject  should be reported t o  
within 24 hours of becoming aware of the event using the pregnancy e CRF.   The investigator 
will also: (1) notify the subject ’s physician that the subject may have been treated with SP-102 
and (2) follow the progress of the pregnancy to term and document the outcome of the 
pregnancy.  Pregnancy outcome information should be forwarded to sponsor/  when 
available. 
 
Any pregna
ncies will
 be followed through delivery or premature termination.  If a subject 
becomes pregnant during the study, any complications of that pregnancy such as abortion (spontaneous or induced), premature birth, or congenital abnormality will be captured as SAEs.  
In the event the e CRF system is unavailable, a back -up paper Pregnancy Reporting Form will be 
available for site staff to complete following reporting guidelines as outlined in Section 4.2.2.

Confidential  Page 57 of 85 5.2.3 Analysis Methods  
No formal statistical hypothesis testing will be performed in this study, however descriptive 
statistics will be presented.  
Unless otherwise specified,  baseline is defined as the last non -missing measurement taken prior 
to treatments T1 or T2 (reference start date).  This includes screening or unscheduled 
assessments that would have been performed no earlier than 21 days before the reference start 
date.  
In the case where the last non -missing measurement and the reference start date coincide, that 
measurement will be considered pre -reference, but AEs and medications commencing on the 
reference start date will be considered post -reference.  
For vital signs p arameters, an assessment performed on reference start date with time point 
marked as “pre- dose” will be considered as baseline.  
For cortisol suppression, glucose, and white blood cell counts, baseline is defined as the last non-missing value obtained prior to T1 or T2, which is T1/T2 Day 1 pre- dose measurement.  
For NPRS, baseline is defined as the last non -missing value obtained prior to T1 or T2, which is 
T1/T2 Day 0 measurement. 
Details on definition of baseline and calculations for the change and percent change in PD values 
will be defined in detail in the SAP.  
5.2.4 Analysis Populations  
The Safety Analysis population is defined as all enrolled subjects who receive at least one 
SP-102 injection.   
The PD Analysis population is defined as all enrolled subjects who have a T1 period baseline PD 
result and at least 1 postdose PD assessment result  without any protocol deviations available in 
either T1 or T2.   
The Complete Analysis population is defined as all enrolled subjects who receive only one 
SP-102 injection who complete T1 – Day  28 plus those subjects who receive two SP -102 
injections who complete T2 – Day  28.  
Protocol deviations should be collected by site  and grouped into different categories, such as 
those who: 
• Entered the study even though they did not s atisfy the entry criteria;  
• Developed withdrawal criteria during the study but were not withdrawn; 
• Received the incorrect dose;  
• Received an excluded concomitant treatment.  
Major protocol violations that impact the PD analysis may lead to exclusion from the PD  
population.  Full details regarding these will be provided in the SAP.

Confidential  Page 58 of 85 5.2.5 Demographic and Baseline Characteristics  
Treatment groups will be compared with respect to subject demographics and baseline 
characteristics and will be summarized using  descriptive statistics, but no formal statistical 
analysis testing will be performed.  
5.2.6 Pharmacodynamic Endpoint s  
• Dexamethasone-induced HPA suppression as measured by: 
o Observed total blood cortisol levels, change from baseline cortisol levels, and 
percent change from b aseline cortisol levels  
o Observed glucose levels, change from baseline glucose levels, and percent change 
from baseline glucose levels  
o  Observed white blood cell counts, change from baseline white blood cell counts, 
and percent change from baseline white bl ood cell counts 
• NPRS (average leg pain and back pain) and BPI- SF  
• Change from T1 Day 0 and T2 Day 0 through Day 28 in NPRS (average leg pain and back pain) and BPI-SF over time following the index (T1) and repeat (T2) epidural 
injections, respectively  
• Percent change from T1 Day 0 and T2 Day 0 through Day 28 in NPRS (average leg pain 
and back pain) and BPI-SF following the index (T1) and repeat (T2) epidural injections, respectively  
5.2.7 Pharmacodynamic Analyses 
All PD analyses will use the PD population as the primary analysis population.   
Cortisol levels, WBC counts, and fasting blood glucose levels (observed, change from baseline, and percent change from baseline) will be summarized by treatment and measurement time using 
descriptive statistics.  Dexamethason e-induced HPA suppression will be evaluated by using the 
observed total plasma cortisol level, blood glucose levels, and WBC count.  Other PD analyses 
may be performed as appropriate.  For these PD endpoints, the pre-dose morning values will be 
determined for each subject as a Baseline for each treatment and the data will be presented as observed value, change from baseline, and as a percent of Baseline value.   
The following pain- score endpoints will be summarized over time by treatment using descriptive 
statistics:  
• NPRS (average leg pain and back pain) and BPI- SF  
• Change from T1 Day 0 and T2 Day 0 through Day 28 in NPRS (average leg pain and back pain) and BPI-SF over time following the index (T1) and repeat (T2) epidural injections, respectively  
• Percent change from T1 Day 0 and T2 Day 0 through Day 28 in NPRS (average leg pain 
and back pain) and BPI-SF following the index (T1) and repeat (T2) epidural injections, respectively

  Version 1.0, 08 Jun  2018 
 
Confidential  Page 59 of 85 For blood cortisol and glucose levels, and WBC counts (change ‐from ‐baseline), PD parameters, 
ie, area under the effect curve over 28 days (AUEC 28 days ) and maximum effect ( Emax) following 
the T1 (index) and T2 (repeat) injections  will be calculated.   
AUEC 28 days  is defined as the change from baseline (for cortisol,  glucose, and WBC) and 
calculated using linear trapezoidal summation from pre -dose to Day 28 in each treatment period.  
Emax is the baseline-adjusted maximum increase in glucose level and WBC count or the 
maximum decrease in cortisol level s over the 28 days post dose in each treatment period.  
The PD parameters will be analyzed using a mixed model analysis of variance using 
PROC MIXED with a fixed effect for treatment and a random effect for subject.  Estimates and 
90% confidence intervals (CIs) will be first constructed in the l ogarithmic scale.  By taking 
anti-logarithms, estimates and C Is for the geometric means and ratios of geometric means will be 
calculated.  All C Is will be 2 -sided.  
A lack of effect of repeat injection on the PD will be concluded if the 90% CIs for the ratio of T2 
(repeat injection; Test) to T1 (index; Reference) for both AUEC 28 days  and E max are completely 
contained within the range of 80 to125%. 
5.2.8 Safety Analyses 
Safety endpoints are as follows: 
• Incidence of treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and SAEs  
• Change from baseline in clinical laboratory parameters, vital sign measurements, ECG  
findings, physical examination, general neurological examination  findings, and targeted 
neurological examination findings following each treatment 
5.2.8.1 Adverse Events  
All AEs will be coded using the most current version of MedDRA.  TE AEs and SAEs will be 
summarized descriptively for each treatment.   
5.2.8.2 Laboratory Data 
Mean changes from Baseline at each post -baseline time point for each laboratory variable will be 
presented .  In addition, each reading will be class ified as below, within, or above normal range, 
based on ranges supplied by the laboratory used.  Shift tables for the Baseline and follow-up 
measurements will be presented.  
5.2.8.3 Vital Signs  
Summary stat istics for the absolute vital sign value and the changes from B aseline will be 
presented by treatment group for each visit, for each of the following vital signs: 
• Systolic blood pressure (mmHg) 
• Diastolic blood pressure (mmHg) 
• Heart rate (bpm)

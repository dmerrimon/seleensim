acceptable method of birth control for the duration of the study  and for at least three 
months after the last dose of study  medication.
Patient is, in the opinion of the Investigator, willing and able to compl y with the 
investigational product regimen and all other stud y requirements.
Exclusion Criteria:
Patient did not success fully  complete Protocol Fx1B -201.
Chronic use of non- protocol approved non -steroidal anti -inflammatory  drugs 
(NSAIDs), defined as greater than 3 to 4 times/month. The following NSAIDs are 
allowed: acety lsalicy lic acid, etodolac, ibuprofen, indomethicin, k etoprofen, 
nabumetone, naproxen, nimesulide, piroxicam, and sulindac.
Patient has a clinicall y significant medical condition that, in the opinion of the 
Investigator, would place the patient at an increased risk to participate in the study .
Pregnant female s; breastfeeding females; females of childbearing potential.
Patient has received a liver or heart transplant.
Study Design:
This is a Phase 3, open- label study  designed to obtain additional long -term safet y and 
efficacy  data in patients who successfull y completed Protocol Fx1B -201. These patients 
will be treated ,with once daily  20mg oral tafamidis (soft gelatin capsule) for up to 10 
years from the date of enrollment in Protocol Fx1B -303, or until subject has access to 
tafamidis for TTR -CM via prescripti on.  Upon regulatory  approval for the treatment of 
TTR -CM in their respective country  and access to prescription tafamidis, subjects may  be 
withdrawn from the study.  The decision to withdraw subjects to transition to commercial 
supply will be done in consultation between the investigator and the sponsor.
Subject s who successfully  complete Fx1B -201 will report to the clinical unit on Day  0 to 
sign the informed consent form and determine eligibility  for Protocol Fx1B -303. In 
addition, on Day  0, subject s will have their entrance criteria reviewed, and medical

weight and vital signs) and the relevant end of study  clinical laboratory  tests (alkaline 
phosphatase, alanine amin
otransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, blood urea nitrogen, 
gamma glutam yl transferase, creatinine, total bilirubin, international normalized ratio, 
troponin I , troponin T, and amino -terminal B -type natriuretic peptide) from Protocol Fx1B -
201 will be us ed for Protocol Fx1B -303. If more than 30 day s has elapsed between the final 
study  visit of Protocol Fx1B -201 and Day  0 of Protocol Fx1B -303, an abbreviated phy sical 
examination (including weight and vital signs) and clinical laboratory  assessments must be
performed on Day  0.
Eligible subject s will begin once -daily dosing with 20 mg tafamidis at home on Day  1 (i.e., 
first dose) and will return to the clinical unit for study  visits every  6 months.
Adverse events (AEs) and concomitant medication use will be c ollected at each 6 -month 
visit to the clinical unit. Blood draws for clinical safet y laboratory  tests and abbreviated 
physical examinations (including weight and vital signs) will also be performed at each 6-
month clinic visit. ECGs will be performed every 12 months on an annual basis. A 
telephone call will be made at 3 -
month intervals between clinic visits to assess safet y and 
use of concomitant medications.
For the evaluation of efficacy , the Patient Global Assessment, NYHA classification, 
KCCQ, 6- minute walk test, and efficacy -related clinical laboratory  tests (serum levels of 
troponin T, troponin I , and NT -pro-BNP) will be determined every  6 months. I n addition, 
echocardiograms will be performed every  12 months on an annual basis. 
An end of stud y visit including all safet y and efficacy assessments will occur upon subject
completion of the study , premature withdrawal (for any  reason), or in the event of program 
discontinuation by  the Sponsor. 
Statistical Methods:
Safety  and efficacy  data will be summari zed using descriptive statistics. For continuous 
variables, the means, standard deviations, medians, and ranges will be presented; for 
categorical variables, counts and percentages (with 95% confidence intervals) will be 
presented. Safet y and efficacy dat a will also be shown in individual subject listings.
The cumulative efficacy  data (starting from Protocol Fx1B -201) as measured by  the Patient 
Global Assessment, NYHA classification, KCCQ, 6-minute walk test, echocardiograms, 
and serum levels of troponin I , troponin T, and NT -pro-BNP will be presented.
The endpoints of mortality and hospitalization (all cause and cardiac -related) will be 
analyzed individuall y and as composite measures. A Kaplan -Meier plot of time to event 
from the baseline of Protocol Fx1B-201 will be generated, and the event rate and 
associated 95% confidence intervals will be presented at 1, 2, 3, and 4 year intervals since 
the start of the investigational drug. The baseline data from protocol Fx1B -201 will be 
used as baseline for the ana lyses. Interim analy ses will be performed during the course of 
the study  to allow for the reporting of safet y and efficacy data from the ongoing study .

1.1.Indication
Tafamidis is being developed for the treatment of transthy retin am yloidosis, specificall y 
targeting ATTR poly neuropathy  and cardiomy opathy .  This protocol will be specific for the 
ATTR cardiom yopath y (TTR -CM) indication.
1.2.Back ground and Rationale
Transthy retin am yloidosis (ATTR) is a disease induced b y accumulation of insoluble fibrillar 
protein as am yloid in the tissues in amounts sufficient to impair normal function
.  The major 
phenoty pic presentations are a sensorimotor and autonomic neuropathy  (ATTR with 
polyneuropathy , or TTR -FAP) and restrictive cardiomy opath y (ATTR with cardiom yopath y, 
or TTR -CM). Transth yretin, a 127
-amino acid, 55 kDa protein, primaril y synthesized in the 
liver, is a secreted protein present in the blood and cerebrospinal fluid and is a carrier of 
thyroxine and retinol- binding protein -retinol (vitamin A) complex [ 1, 2]. In its native state, 
TTR exists as a homotet ramer with two C2 symmetric funnel -shaped thy roxine binding sites 
located at the central dimer-dimer interface [3, 4, 5].
Natural amino acid sequence (wild -type) TTR and mutated variants of TTR can be involved 
in amy loid disease. However, mutated TTR species are more prone to accelerated 
fibrillogenesis, the most important risk factor for TTR amy loidosis [ 1, 2].There are more 
than 80 TTR point mutations that have been associated with TTR amy loidosis [ 6] . All 
disease -associated mutations characterized thus far destabilize the TTR tetramer and man y 
influence the velocity  of rate -limiting tetramer dissociation [ 7]. An amy loidogenic mutation 
or aging can lead to tetramer dissociation into an alterna tively folded monomeric 
amyloidogenic intermediate. This intermediate self -assembles into profilaments, filaments, 
and, under certain conditions, amy loid fibrils [ 8, 9]. In fact, the rate determining step for 
TTR amy loid formation is tetramer dissociation [ 10].
Cardiac involvement in ATTR, also known as familial amy loid cardiom yopathy when 
associated with variant TTR, or s enile sy stemic amy loidosis (SSA) when associated with 
wild-type TTR, is associated with am yloid fibril infiltration of the my ocardium, leading to 
diastolic dy sfunction progressing to restrictive cardiomy opath y and congestive heart failure 
[
3].ATTR -CM is a late -onset disease with s ymptoms ty picall y occurring in patients over 
60years of age. Although there are approximately  24 mutations associated with specific 
cardiac involvement, one common mutation, V122I  (substitution of isoleucine for valine at 
position 122), has been reported with high frequency (prevalence of 3.4% to 3.9% 
[2]) in 
African -Americans. In an autopsy  series, African Americans older than 60 y ears of age were 
found to be at greater risk of TTR amy loid cardiac deposits compared with Caucasians or 
Hispanics (1.6% vs. 0.4 and 0.13 respectivel y) [11] . In addition, 23% of the African 
American patients with TTR cardiac am yloidosis with evaluable DNA samples were 
heterozygous with the V122I  mutation. Finally , all patients found to be V122I  heteroz ygous 
had evidence of TTR cardiac am yloid on autopsy . These data confirm the association of the 
V122I TTR mutation with TTR amy loid cardiomyopathy  and suggest a high clinical 
penetrance 
[11].

Page 17A mutation in TTR is not a pre -requisite for developing ATTR- CM. In the elderl y, wild -type 
(normal) TTR may  become structurall y unstabl e resulting in deposition of amy loid fibrils 
primarily  in heart tissue and leading to diastolic dysfunction, restrictive cardiomy opath y, and 
congestive heart failure [ 4, 5, 6, 7]. The frequency of TTR amy loid deposition in cardiac 
ventricles reported from autopsy  studies in patients >80 y ears of age range from 1.8% [ 12] to 
16.5% [
13], with a rate of clinical cardiac disease pre -mortem of 34% [13].
For both wild -type and variant ATTR -CM, TTR amy loidfibrils are deposited in the 
myocardial interstitium, causing an increase in ventricular wall thickness, inducing 
myocardial damage and affecting m yocardial function. Clinical sy
mptoms include dy spnea 
on exertion, shortness of breath, orthostatic h ypoten sion, sy ncope, and atrial fibrillation. 
Electrocardiogram findings demonstrate low voltage [ 14], particularl y in light of the 
markedl y thickened ventricular walls (median wall thickness of 17 mm [ 14]) demonstrated 
by echocardiogram. Amino -terminal B -type natriuretic peptide (NT -Pro
-BNP), a serum 
marker of cardiac wall stress, is elevated in this population [ 15].
Current tr eatment is s ymptomatic, with careful fluid management and management of 
arrhythmias the mainstay. Median survival is approximately  60 months [ 14, 15], with 
42% of pa tients dy ing from a cardiac cause [ 16]. Combined heart and liver transplantation is 
a current treatment option, however limited organ availability  and significant patient co -
morbidity  limit transplant as a trea tment option.
The natural history  of TTR -CM was studied in the Transthy retin Am yloidosis Cardiac Study  
(TRACS), in a cohort of patients followed longitudinally  for 24 months. Using a variet y of 
cardiovascular monitoring examinations (e.g., electrocardiogr ams [ECG], echocardiograph y, 
cardiac magnetic resonance imaging [MRI ], exercise tolerance testing), the study  evaluated 
how the disease affects patients over time. This information will be utilized in two way s: 
(1)to better define the natural course of t he disease; and (2) more importantly , to better 
understand how to measure the effectiveness of future treatments by  identify ing endpoints 
that are well -correlated with disease progression/regression and to support the selection of 
endpoints to be used in c linical trials.
Data on 29 patients (mean age 74 years) have been anal yzed (18 wild- type and 11 V122I). 
Most patients are male (92%) and are New York Heart Association (NYHA) 
Classification I or II with significant cardiac s ymptoms reported at baseline. After an 
average follow -up time of 16 months, 11 patients died and one patient underwent cardiac 
transplant, giving the proportion of death/cardiac death of 41%, and a death rate per patient 
month exposure of 0.03. In addition, 41% of the patients experie nced a cardiac 
hospitalization at least once, and 55% of the patients died or had a cardiac hospitalization. 
Preliminary  anal ysis of cardiac assessments demonstrate significantl y elevated NT- Pro-BNP 
and troponin levels, abnormal functional status as asses sed b y the 6 -minute walk test, and 
significant diastolic d ysfunction and thickened ventricles as assessed by  echocardiograph y 
and cardiac MRI.

Page 181.2.1. Tafamidis for the Treatment of TTR
Pfizer I nc is currently  investigating tafamidis for the treatment of TTR -CM. Tafamidis
meglumine [d-glucitol, 1 -deox y -1-(meth ylamino) - , 2-(3,5-dichloropheny l)-6-
benzoxazolecarbox ylate (1:1) ] is the meglumine salt form of 
2-(3,5-dichloro -phen yl) -benzoxazole -6-carbox ylic acid and is a novel, small molecule 
stabilizer of transthy retin. Specificall y, tafamidis exhibits negative cooperative binding (i.e., 
dissociation constants of 2 nM [K d1] and 154 nM [K d2], respectively ) to the two thy roxine 
binding sites on the native tetrameric form of TTR and thereb y prevents its dissociation into 
monomers. At low pH, fibril formation of wild- type TTR and the most prevalent 
amyloidogenic variants, V30M and V122I, is potently  inhibited by  tafamidis. No fibril 
formation is observed for wild
-type, V30M, and V122I  variants at a 2:1 tafamidis :TTR 
stoic hiometry . Under urea denaturating conditions, only  33% of TTR tetramer dissociates 
after incubation for 72 hours with equimolar quantity  of tafamidis
, when negligible tetramer 
dissociation is observed at a 2:1 tafamidis:TTR stoichiometry . Based on these data, it 
appears that a 1:1 tafamidis:TTR stoichiometry  should be sufficient to stabilize TTR. The 
normal range of TTR level is between 18 and 38 mg/dL, corresponding to 3.2 to 6.8 M of 
TTR. Therefore, plasma levels of 3.6 to 7.2 M (~1 -2 g/mL) of tafamidis should stabilize 
TTR levels at least to the upper limit of the normal range.
In vitro addition of tafamidis to human plasma stabilizes wild -type, V30M, and V122I 
tetrameric TTR under strong urea denaturing conditions for at least four days. Under these 
same conditions most of the TTR is denatured in two day s in the absence of stabilizer. 
Stabilization is observed at tafamidis concentrations between 3.6 and 7.2 M for TTR plasma 
levels ranging from low (15.5 mg/dL [2.8 M]) to high (28 mg/dL [5 M]), confirming the 
effective therapeutic plasma level range between 3.6 and 7.2 M (corresponding to 
~1-2g/mL concentration of tafamidis in plasma). Ex-vivo results with plasma samples 
from initial Phase 1 clinical testing confirm this hypothesis and indic ate that drug plasma 
levels between 0.7 to 1.7 g/mL stabilize plasma TTR (when TTR plasma levels are between 
16 and 36 mg/dL) after once a day  dosing with tafamidis. Based on Phase 1 results, this drug 
level range would be achieved at stead y-state after once -daily 20 mg (soft gelatin capsule), 
the tafamidis dose chosen for clinical evaluation.
1.2.2. Study Rationale
The initial development activities for tafamidis were undertaken in patients with TTR -FAP.
Safety  data in this population, and the results from the TRACS study , led to the initiation of 
Protocol Fx1B -201, a 12-month trial of tafamidis in patients with TTR -CM. The results of 
the Fx1B -201 study  will be used in the design of a Phase 3 program that will evaluate the 
efficacy  and safet y of tafamidis in TTR-CM.
TTR -CM is a slowly  progressing disease with a median survival of approximately  60months 
[14, 15].  I t is currently  not known whether tafamidis will be effecti ve in slowing or halting 
the progression of TTR amy loid cardiom yopath y, or when such an impact would become 
evident. Therefore, the purpose of the current study  is to assess the long -term safet y and 

Tafamidis
B3461026
Final Protocol Amendment 1, 14 June 2012
Page 19efficacy  of tafamidis in patients with ATTR- CM. Eligibl e patients who successfully  
completed Protocol Fx1B- 201, having received open -label tafamidis for 12 months, may  
enroll in Protocol Fx1B -303 and continue to receive open -label tafamidis for up to an 
additional 10 years.
1.2.3. Non-Clinical Experience with Tafamid is
Nonclinical pharmacology , pharmacokinetic (absorption, distribution, metabolism, and 
excretion; ADME), and toxicology  studies conducted both in vitro and in vivo in the mouse, 
rat, rabbit, and dog have been completed.  In vitro nonclinical studies have confirmed that the 
pharmacological activity of tafamidis is consistent with its high affinity  binding to the two 
thyroxine binding sites of TTR in a non -cooperative manner and the resulting stabilization of 
TTR (wild ty pe and am yloidogenic variants) b y pre venting dissociation of tetramers into 
monomers.
The general safet y pharmacology profile of tafamidis demonstrated minimal nonselective 
binding to enzy mes or ion channels, with no potential f or anti -inflammatory  activity .  
Tafamidis had minimal effects on either the central nervous sy stem or cardiopulmonary
physiology  parameters in dogs. Tafamidis did not demonstrate the potential for QT 
prolongation. QTc shortening, observed at doses of 100 and 300 mg/kg, was associated with 
total plasma concentrations t hat exceeded 90 µg/mL .However, mean human steady -state 
maximum concentration (C max) values following the daily  therapeutic dose of 20 mg in 
elderl y and nonelderl y subjects were 2.8 and 2.3 µg/mL respectivel y.Given the 30 to 
40-fold difference in exposu res, it is felt that the nonclinical observations have little 
relevance to the clinical profile of tafamidis.
Predictable pharmacokinetic behavior of tafamidis was demonstrated following oral 
administration in the nonclinical species. Tafamidis was absorb ed following oral 
administration with an absolute bioavailability  >90% and exhibited dose proportional 
increases in C maxand AUC at dose up to 30 mg/kg, but further increases in the administered 
dose provided less than proportional increases in sy stemic ex posure, indicating saturation in 
the drug absorption. Terminal plasma half life is about 40 hours following a single 
administration. Drug accumulation has been confirmed in repeated dose studies.
Tafamidis is readil
y absorbed through the intestinal wall upon administration and is bound to 
a high extent to plasma proteins (>97%), essentially  TTR and albumin. Tafamidis distributes 
widely  in tissues (maternal and fetal), crosses the placental barrier to an extent of less than 
5% of the initial dose, and ~ 30% of the dam’s dose transferred into the milk.
Tafamidis demonstrated a high degree of metabolic stability  and its limited biotransformation 
resulted in the formation of a monoglucuronide (acy lglucuronide) as the primary
 metabolite 
in most of the nonclini cal species and humans, while a monooxidative product was onl y 
detected in the mouse and rabbit.   In rats, tafamidis is cleared primarily via biliary  excretion 
and fecal elimination with some enterohepatic circulation, with a sma ller contribution by  the 
urine.  A human ADME study  suggests similar pathway s are operative in humans.

Page 20Tafamidis meglumine has been evaluated in vitro to assess protein binding, induction and 
inhibition of cy tochrome P450 enzy mes (1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6 and 3A4/5), and 
inhibi tion of transporter protein P gl ycoprotein (P gp), with results suggesting very low 
likelihood for clinical drug -drug interactions.  No significant CYP 450 inhibition was 
observed.  A series of nonclinical toxicity  studies were conducted in mice, rats, and dogs to 
assess the safety  of tafamidis. The absence of acute toxicity  following a single dose of 
tafamidis up to 600 mg/kg in dogs is indicative of a low risk for overdose.  Tafamidis was 
well tolerated following repeated daily  oral administration up to 26 weeks in rats and 
39weeks in dogs. The NOAEL was determined to be 30 mg/kg/day  in the rat and 
45mg/kg/day  in dog. When doses were increased above the NOAELs, rodents had a drug 
accumulation in their stomachs while dogs vomited. Other signs of toxic ity accompanied 
these obvious signs, including decreased food intake, modified feces, stress related signs, 
increase in liver weight and in liver enzy me levels, ly mphoid depletion, and kidney  lesions in 
rodents. 
Tafamidis was nongenotoxic in a battery  of in vitro studies, although a slight increase in 
frequency  of pol yploid cells was observed at 100 and 200 µg/mL in the presence of 
S9activation but not without metabolic activation in the in vitro chromosome aberration 
assay  using human peripheral l ymphocy tes.Polyploidy  is not considered to be a reliable 
surrogate marker for aneugenicity .  The lack of risk for aneuploidy  induction with tafamidis 
was further evidenced b y the lack of micronucleus induction in the bone marrow of 
Sprague -Dawley  rats at the do ses producing C maxand AUC values significantly  exceeding 
the predicted clinical exposures (~ 72X over the C maxand ~ 67X over the stead y state 
AUC (0-24)observed in humans, based on exposure in a 4 -week rat stud y).The evaluation of 
the carcinogenic pote ntial in hemizy gous Tg.rasH2 mice did not demonstrate an increase in 
the incidence of neoplasia.
Tafamidis did not demonstrate an y effects on fertility , general reproductive performance and 
early embr yo-
fetal development in the rat and the maternal and p aternal NOEL  for 
reproductive toxicity  was determined to be greater than 30 mg/kg/day .Developmental 
toxicity  was evident in the rat b y reduced fetal weights in the 30 and 45 mg/kg/day maternal 
dosage groups (developmental NOAEL = 15 mg/kg). Developmenta l toxicity  in the rabbit 
was demonstrated b y increased post -implantation loss, reduced fetal body  weight and 
associated skeletal variations, and m alformation at 8 mg/kg and skele tal variations at 
2mg/kg/day .The NOEL for developmental toxicity  in rabbits was 0.5 mg/kg/day .
Tafamidis- related toxicity  in the developmental and perinatal/postnatal reproduction toxicity  
study  in rats resulted in a NOAEL for reproductive toxicity  and for viability  and growth of 
the F1 generation of 5 mg/kg/day .Women of child -bearing potential should take measures 
to prevent pregnancy while being treated with tafamidis.
Non-clinical data indicate that there is a large safety  margin above the anticipated human 
efficacious plasma concentration and those concentrations associated with toxicity  in rats or 
dogs. Emesis was the most common form of clinical intolerance in the dog. Owing to the 
dosing strategy , the immediate emetic activity  led to apparent aspiration of gastric contents 
and/or drug, leading to moribundity  and subsequ ent euthanasia. The gastric impaction and 

Tafamidis
B3461026
Final Protocol Amendment 1, 14 June 2012
Page 21subsequent delay ed gastric empty ing, presumabl y followed by circulatory distress, shock and 
multiorgan failure, in rats was caused b y a supraclinical dosing regimen and is not a relevant 
risk to human subjects. W hile the exact mechanism(s) for the toxicities observed following 
the oral administration of tafamidis has not been elucidated, there is an ample therapeutic 
margin to permit safe exposure to humans and there was no toxicity  identified that would 
preclude human use, such as undetectable lesions or irreversible damage.
No target organs of tafamidis- related toxicity  were identified in the repeated dose toxicity  
studies conducted in rats or dogs (26 weeks and 39 weeks, respectivel y).However, in the 
CByB6F1 hybrid mouse and the tg.rasH2 mouse, the liver and/or kidney  have been identified 
as target organs as non -neoplastic lesions were noted following treatment for 28 days 
(CBy B6F1 h ybrid mouse) or 26 weeks (tg.rasH2 mouse). Nephrosis was the primary  lesion 
noted in the kidney s, only  in male mice and in a dose -dependent manner. In the liver, 
centrilobular h ypertrophy and scattered single cell necrosis were present in male mice more 
than in the female mice in terms of the incidence of both lesions and the sev erity of the 
centrilobular h ypertrophy. The incidence of both liver lesions was dose dependent.
However, the mouse (CByB6F1) did not demonstrate a unique monooxide metabolite that 
was not present in the rat or dog, nor has it been detected in the plasma of hu mans 
administered tafamidis.   However, a causal relationship between the monoxide metabolite 
and the liver and/or kidney  lesions has not been established.
Generally , there were no significant toxicities observed in the repeated dose toxicology  
studies in the rat and dog. Therefore, tafamidis was considered to be well tolerated in the rat 
at dose levels up to 30 mg/kg/day  for 26 weeks, providing an exposure ratio of 45- to 63 -fold 
based on the human AUC at steady  state, and in the dog at dose levels up to 45 mg/kg/day  for 
39 weeks providing an exposure ratio of 29- to 36 -fold based on the human AUC at stead y 
state.  Additionally , there was no evidence for an increased risk of neoplasia at exposures at 
least 31- fold the human AUC nor was there evidence o f any tafamidis -related genotoxicity .
With the exception of the reproductive developmental toxicity  findings, tafamidis has an 
excellent nonclinical safety  profile.
Refer to the Tafamidis Investigator Brochure for further details.
1.2.4. Tafamidis Clinical Exper ience
The clinical development program for tafamidis has included 13 controlled and uncontrolled 
clinical trials and two non- interventional, observational studies completed primarily  in 
patients with TTR- FAP.  As of 13 May  2011, patients with TTR -FAP (n=12 7) received 
20mg of tafamidis administered dail y for an average of 538 days (range of 15 to 994 days) 
or approximately  187 patient -years. The mean duratio n of exposure was 17.7 months: 
87were treated for at least 1 y ear, 43 were treated for at least 2 years, and 31 were treated for 
at least 30- <36 months.  
The tafamidis 20 mg soft gelatin capsule (as used in the clinical studies) demonstrated a 
half-life average of 59 hours and C avg(SS) average of 2.07 μg/mL (SD=0.20). The tafamidis 
20-mg soft gelatin capsule daily  dose resulted in an average fluctuation (peak to trough) of 

Tafamidis
B3461026
Final Protocol Amendment 1, 14 June 2012
Page 2251.8%, with an average minimum concentration (C min) of 1.61 μg/mL  and an average C maxof 
2.66 μg/mL . The average range was consistent with the 1 to 2 µg/mL  required to stabilize 
TTR levels bey ond the upper limit of the normal range; steady state was attained within 
12days, and exposure was consistent across subjects, with low variability  across subjects for 
key PK parameters.  Note that steady -state exposure was similar between male s and females.  
Therefore, the 20 mg daily dose has been used in the development program.  Further, based 
on a population PK anal ysis, no dose adjustment is necessary  for the elderl y or patients with 
hepatic or renal impairment. 
The primary  purpose of a t herap y such as tafamidis is to stabilize the TTR tetramer, thus 
inhibiting the amy loid cascade and ultimatel y halting or slowing TTR -FAP disease 
progression over a sustained period of time.  During the 18 -month period of intervention in 
Study  Fx-005, tafam idis slowed the course of neurological impairment and maintained 
quality  of life in treated patients. Together, with the extension Study  Fx-006 data, tafamidis 
demonstrated a sustained effect over 30 months, a period of time representing approximately  
25% of the average TTR-FAPPN disease duration of 10 y ears. Further, Study  Fx1A -201 was 
a small Phase 2 II open label, single -treatment arm study  designed primarily to determine the 
efficacy  of tafamidis in stabilizing TTR variants other than the V30M (valin e replaced b y 
methionine at position 30) mutation. The resul ts from this study  of non -V30M TTR -FAP
patients, which represented an older, more severely  affected patient population, strongl y 
supported the observed efficacy  of tafamidis in V30M patients.  As in Study Fx -005, the 
consistency  of response across endpoints measuring different aspects of this multi -faceted 
disease was again observed following 12 months treatment with tafamidis.  The results 
indicated the disease- modify ing utility  of tafamidis in treating all patients with TTR -FAPPN, 
regardless of mutation. 
Study  Fx1B -201 was a small Phase 2 study  in TTR -CM in which a total of 35 patients were 
enrolled and anal yzed, 31 patients with wild -type genot ype and 4 with V122I  genoty pe.  As 
expected, the pa tients were elderly  (mean age approximately  76 y ears), with significant 
disease duration (approximately  8 years) and signs and sy mptoms of mild to moderate 
cardiac d ysfunction (84% with NYHA Class I or II) at the time of enrollment.
Tafamidis effectivel y stabilized TTR in 34 of 35 (97.1%) patients, representing both 
wild-type and V122I, at Week 6, with approximately  88% stabilized throughout the 
12months.
Following 12 months treatment with tafamidis, along with routine standard of care, 
2/35 (5.7%) patient s died, 9/35 (25.7%) experienced at least one card iovascular 
hospitalization, and 9/35 (25.7%) experienced the composite endpoint of death or 
cardiovascular hospitalization.  Results were similar between the TTR genoty pe groups.  
These data were numericall y better than that reported in the TRACS historical control cohort, 
during which the 12 -month rate of death, cardiovascular hospitalizations and 
death/cardiovascular hospitalizations were 6/29 (20.7%), 10/29 (34.5%) and 13/29 (44.8%), 
respectivel y.

Tafamidis
B3461026
Final Protocol Amendment 1, 14 June 2012
Page 23Cardiac biomarkers (NT -proBNP, troponin I and T) at baseline were elevated, which was not 
unexpected given the patients’ underl ying cardiac involvement.  The change in NT -proBNP 
over 12 months was relatively  small, and numerically  lower than that observed in TRAC S.  
Troponin I and T, more specific markers of cardiac necrosis, remained stable, suggesting no 
substantial deterioration of cardiac status over 12 months of tafamidis treatment.  These data 
are supported b y the functional assessments of NYHA classificatio n and 6MWT.  At 
12 months, 75% of the patients had improved or preserved NYHA classification, with the 
overall population demonstrating minimal change in distance walked ( -11 meters).  This 
maintained functional walking capacit y is in contrast to the deter ioration observed in TRACS 
at 12 months ( -44 meters).
Non-invasive cardiac assessments demonstrated significant cardiac involvement at baseline, 
with substantial ventricular wall thickening (echocardiograph y and cardiac MRI ) and 
elevated intra -cardiac fill ing pressures (echocardiography).  There were no consistent 
clinically  relevant changes in these parameters over time (echocardiography ).  For the 
wild-type patients (the majority  of patients in the study ), the deterioration in ejection fraction 
(-3.9) and stroke volume ( -8.0) observed in the current study  was less than that observed in 
TRACS ( -10.5 and - 15.4, respectivel y) at 12 months.  Similar findings were observed in a 
subset of patients that underwent cardiac MRI.  An additional finding in cardiac MRI was a 
decrease in percent of left ventricle (LV) mass with amy loid observed at 12 months in the 
small subgroup of patients undergoing this assessment, while there was an increase in LV 
mass with amy loid observed in TRACS. 
Baseline electrocardiogram and 24-hour Holter monitoring demonstrated substantial 
conduction and rh ythm abnormalities, including bundle branch blocks and atrial 
fibrillation/flutter.  There were no clinically  relevant changes over time in these assessments, 
with perhaps slight improvemen t in cardiac autonomic function as demonstrated by  improved 
heart rate variability  indices.
Over the 12 months of tafamidis treatment, the patients’ quality  of life was maintained as was 
their functional status, as assessed b y the SF -36, and KCCQ and PGA, respectivel y.The 
majority  of these results were also better when compared with TRACS. 
Seven patients participated in both TRACS (median follow up 12.5 months, with range of 
6-26 months) and in Study  Fx1B -201. All seven patients completed 12 months of t reatment 
with tafamidis. However, given the small number of patients, it is difficult to assess whether 
disease progression was different during treatment with tafamidis as compared to standard of 
care in TRACS.  The rate of cardiovascular hospitalization was similar between the two 
12-month periods, with some evidence of stabilized cardiac function (ejection fraction and 
fractional shortening) observed following treatment with tafamidis. 
Overall, tafamidis was effective in achieving and maintaining TTR s tabilization in both 
wild-type and V122I patients and showed an apparent stabilization of the progression of 
cardiac disease.

Page 25and d iscontinuations due to adverse events.  In addition, other factors taken into 
consideration for the determination of ADRs included but were not limited to the mechanism 
of action of tafamidis, the known s ymptoms of the underl ying TTR am yloidosis, the 
temporality  of the adverse event to the administration of tafamidis, and the relative rates of 
comparative adverse events in the placebo groups in the controlled trials.  Based on the 
review of the totality  of the available safet y data, it was determined that there are four 
adverse events for which there is basis to believe there is a causal relationship between their 
occurrence and the use of tafamidis; as such these adverse events were identified as ADRs, 
with the incidence observed in the placebo -controlled 1 8 month Phase 2/3 Study  
Fx-005 presented in Table 2.

There were no meaningful changes in vital signs, clinical laboratory  parameters, ECG 
parameters (including QTc interval), or other safety  parameters measured.  No meaningful 
changes in echocardiogram and ECG were observed for patients with a medical history of 
cardiom yopath y.  Tafamidis has been well tolerated by  both health y subjects during the 
Phase 1 clinical studies as well as in patients during the Phase 2 and 3clinical studies.
Tafamidis was also studied in patients with TTR cardiomy opathy in Study  Fx1B -201.  These 
patients were elderl y (mean age 76 years) with signs a nd sy mptoms of mild to moderate 
cardiac d ysfunction.  While there was no placebo control group, the adverse event profile of 
tafamidis reported during this study  reflects the patients’ underly ing disease, co
-morbid 
conditions, and elderl y status.  The most frequent adverse events overall were related to the 
symptoms and episodes of heart failure (d yspnea, cardiac failure and edema).  Eighteen 
(51.4%) patients reported at least one TEAE that was considered at least possibly  related to 
study  medication as ass essed by  the Investigator.  The most common (>5%) treatment -related 
TEAEs included balance disorder (14.3%), ageusia (8.6%), constipation, diarrhea, edema 
peripheral, fall, weight increased, and decreased appetite and dy spnea (5.7% each). The 
majority  (≥85%) of patients experienced TEAEs considered mild or moderate in severit y.  
One event of h yperkalemia reported during a hospitalization for decompensated heart failure 
and associated with acute renal failure was considered life- threatening , and not related to 
tafamidis.

Page 305.2.3. Administration
All enrolled subject s will self -administer a once- daily  oral dose of 20 mg tafamidis at home 
as instructed b y the clinical staff. All investigational product is to be taken by  mouth, with 
water. Subject s will be instructed to t ake investigational product at the same time each day  
throughout the treatment period.
Medication errors may  result, in this study , from the administration or consumption of the 
drug b y the subject at the wrong time, or at the wrong dose strength. Such me dication errors 
occurring to a stud y participant are to be captured on the adverse event (AE) page of the 
CRFs and on the SAE form when appropriate.  In the event of medication dosing error, the 
sponsor should be notified immediately .
Medication errors are reportable irrespective of the presence of an associated AE/SAE, 
including:
Medication errors involving subject exposure to the product.
Potential medication errors or uses outside of what is foreseen in the protocol that do or 
do not involve the partici pating subject.
Whether or not the medication error is accompanied by  an AE, asdetermined by  the 
investigator , the 
medication error and, if applicable, any  associated adverse event (s)is 
captured on an adverse event (AE) CRF page (refer to
 Adverse Event Reporting section for 
further details ).
5.2.4. Compliance
All investigational product will be self- administered by  subject s at home. Subject s should be 
instructed to bring all investigational product and packaging to e ach follow -up visit to the 
clinical unit every  six months. Compliance to investigational product will be determined 
through capsule counting procedures at subject visits to clinic. Compliance will be 
monitored and recorded in each subject ’s case report f orm (CRF). Additionally , 
investigational product accountability  audits will be performed by  the study  monitor during 
routine monitoring visits.
5.3. Drug Storage and Drug Accountability 
All investigational product (tafamidis) should be stored at controlled ro om temperature 
15-25°C (59- 77°F). Investigational product should be stored in its original package and

Page 31Temperature of stora ge conditions should be monitored using validated devices that record 
maximum and minimum temperatures, are regularly  calibrated, and data are regularly  
recorded.  Should the product experience temperature excursion, relative to label instruction, 
during s torage, then the impact to product quality  and use should be addressed with relavant 
subject matter experts and documented accordingly.
Occasional short -term excursions from the intended storage conditions may occur. If the 
duration is short and the devia tion in temperature is small, an investigation into the quality  of 
the product is generally  not required.
Subjects should be reminded of the storage conditions when drug is dispensed.   
5.4. Concomitant Medication(s)
On Day  0, in conjunction with the review of their medical history , all subjects will be asked 
what medications they  are taking.  Thereafter, subjects will be asked what medications they  
have been taking at 3 -month intervals (i.e., during clinic visits every  6 months and via 
telephone contact at 3 -month intervals between clinic visits).  All concomitant medications 
will be recorded on the CRF.
Chronic use of non- protocol approved non -steroidal anti -inflammatory  drugs 
(NSAIDs), defined as greater than 3 to 4 times/month is not permitted .
The following NSAIDs are allowed: acet ylsalicy lic acid, etodolac, ibuprofen, 
indomethicin, ketoprofen, nabumetone, naproxen, nimesulide, piroxicam, and 
sulindac.
6. STUDY PROCEDURES 
Every  effort should be made to ensure that scheduled visits are made and protocol required
tests and procedures are completed as described.  From time to time there may  be 
circumstances, outside of the control of the investigator, which may  not make a clinic visit 
possible .  In these cases, with prior discussion and approval from the sponsor, a lternative 
options may  be considered.  Approved alternate options will not be considered protocol 
deviations.
Study  procedures are outline d in the Schedule of Activities.
6.1.Screening /Baseline Assessment
The end of stud y physical exam
ination (including weight and vital signs) and the relevant 
clinical laboratory  assessments from Protocol Fx1B -201 will be used as the

Record concomitant medic ations.
Determine drug compliance and accountability .
In the event a subject is unable to return to the study  site for the end of study  visit, telephone 
contact with the subject approximately  30 day s after the last dose of medication to assess 
adverse events and concomitant medications and treatments is expected. If laboratory  
assessments are needed to follow- up unresolved adverse events, retrieval of assessments 
performed at an institution local to the subject is acceptable.
The outcome of adverse events with a date of onset during the study period should be 
reevaluated, and an y new adverse events should be recorded. All serious adverse events, and 
those non- serious adverse events assessed by  the investigator as possibly  related to study  
drug should conti nue to be followed even after subject withdrawal from study . These 
adverse events should be followed until they  resolve or until the investigator assesses them to 
be “chronic” or “stable”. Additional information on Adverse Event Reporting can be found 
inSection 8.
6.3.Subject Withdrawal
Subjects may
 withdraw from the study  at any  time at their own request, or they  may  be 
withdrawn at an y time at the discretion of the investigator or sponsor for safety or behaviora l 
reasons, or the inability  of the subject to compl y with the protocol required schedule of stud y 
visits or procedures at a given stud y site. In addition, the Sponsor may  choose to discontinue 
this study , at which time all subjects will be withdrawn.
A subject may  be withdrawn from the stud y for any of the following reasons:
Withdrawal of consent;
Adverse event;
Protocol noncompliance;
Subject lost to follow -up;
Subject death.

Tafamidis
B3461026
Final Protocol Amendment 1, 14 June 2012
Page 35Subjects who are prematurely  withdrawn from the study  will not be replaced.  Subjects who 
discontinue from the study at an y time following enrollment will have a final end of stud y 
visit performed, including all safet y and efficacy assessments, at the time of discontinuation.
Upon regulatory  approval of tafamadis for the treatment of TTR -CM in their respective 
country , and access to prescription tafamidis, subjects may  be withdrawn from the study .
The decision to withdraw subjects in a country  will be done in consultation between the 
investigator and the sponsor. Subjects will have a ll end of study  procedures completed prior 
to study  withdrawal. These subjects are considered completers.  
If a subject does not return for a scheduled visit, every  effort should be made to contact the 
subject.  In an y circumstance, every effort should be made to document subject outcome, if 
possible.  The investigator should inquire about the reason for withdrawal, request the subject 
to return all unused investigational product(s), request the subject to return for a final visit, if 
applicable, and follow- up with the subject regarding an y unresolved adverse events (AEs) .
If the subject withdraws from the study , and also withdraws consent for disclosure of future 
information, no further evaluations should be performed, and no additional data should be 
collected.  The sponsor may  retain and continue to use any  data collected before such 
withdrawal of consent.
7.ASSESSMENTS
Every  effort should be made to ensure that the protocol required tests and procedures are 
completed as described. However it is anticipate d that from time to time there may  be 
circumstances, outside of the control of the investigator, that may  make it unfeasible to 
perform the test. In these cases the investigator will take all steps necessary to ensure the 
safet y and well being of the subj ect. When a protocol required test cannot be performed the 
investigator will document the reason for this and any corrective and preventive actions 
which he/she has taken to ensure that normal processes are adhered to as soon as possible.
The study  team will be informed of these incidents in a timely  fashion.
7.1.Efficacy Assessments
All efficacy  evaluations will be performed at each 6 -month clinic visit, except for 
echocardiograms, which will be performed every 12 months on an annual basis.
Each echocardiogr am will be recorded and reviewed locall y by the clinical site, and the 
clinical significance of the findings will be assessed by  the Investigator. Each 
echocardiogram will also be sent to an independent imaging laboratory  for centralized review 
of the res ults. Detailed instructions for performing echocardiograph y will be provided in a 
separate manual.
The 6 -minute walk test will be conducted in accordance with guidelines established by  the 
American Thoracic Society . Detailed instructions for conducting the 6 -minute walk test will 
be provided in a separate manual.

The si te will perform ECGs in accordance with standard site practice. Ten-second rh ythm 
strips will accompan y each ECG. The ECGs will be recorded and reviewed locally  by the 
clinical site, and the clinical significance of the findings will be assessed by the I nvestigator.
7.5.Adverse Events
Starting from the date the informed consent form is signed, adverse events (AEs) will be 
recorded in the CRF and monitored throughout the study . All adverse events should be 
monitored until they  are resolved or are clearl y dete rmined to be due to a subject ’s stable or 
chronic condition or intercurrent illness(es). All AEs will be recorded on the CRF. 
Definitions, documentation, and reporting of AEs are described in Section 9.
7.6.Concomi tant Medications
On Day  0, in conjunction with the review of their medical history , all subject s will be asked 
about the medications they  are taking. Thereafter, subject s will be asked about the 
medications they  have been taking at 3 -month intervals (i.e. , during clinic visits every  six 
months and via telephone contact at 3 -
month intervals between clinic visits). All 
concomitant medications will be recorded on the CRF.
8.ADVERSE EVENT REPORT ING
8.1.Adverse Events
All observed or volunteered AEs regardless of tr eatment group or suspected causal 
relationship to the investigational product(s) will be reported as described in the following 
sections. 
For all AEs, the investigator must pursue and obtain information adequate both to determine 
the outcome of the AEandto assess whether it meets the criteria for classification as an SAE
requiring immediate notification to Pfizer or its designated representative.  For all AEs, 
sufficient information should be obtained b y the investigator to determine the causalit y of the
AE.  The investigator is required to assess causality .  Follow -up by  the investigator may  be 
required until the event or its sequelae resolve or stabilize at a level acceptable to the 
investigator, and Pfizer concurs with that assessment.
As part of ongoi ng safet y reviews conducted b y the Sponsor, an y non -serious adverse event 
that is determined b y the Sponsor to be serious will be reported b y the Sponsor as a n SAE .  
To assist in the determination of case seriousness further information may  be requested fr om 
the investigator to provide clarit y and understanding of the event in the context of the clinical 
trial.

Page 398.2.Reporting Period
For SAE s, the active reporting period to Pfizer or its designated representative begins from 
the time that the subject provides i nformed consent, which is obtained prior to the subject’s 
participation in the study , ie, prior to undergoing any  study -related procedure and/or 
receiving investigational product, through and including 28 calendar day s after the last 
administration of the investigational product.  Should an investigator be made aware of a ny 
SAE occurring an y time after the active reporting period, it must be promptly  reported. 
AEs (serious and non -serious) should be recorded on the CRF from the time the 
subject has taken a t least one dose of study  treatment through last subject visit.   
8.3.Definition of an Adverse Event
An AEis an y untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation subject administered a 
product or medical device; the event need not necessarily  have a ca usal relationship with the 
treatment or usage.  Examples of AEs include but are not limited to:
Abnormal test findings;
Clinically  significant symptoms and signs;
Changes in ph ysical examination findings;
Hypersensitivity ;
Progression/worsening of underl ying disease ;
Drug abuse;
Drug dependency .
Additionally , they  may  include the signs or s ymptoms resulting from:
Drug overdose;
Drug withdrawal;
Drug misuse; 
Drug interactions;
Extravasation;
Exposure during pregnancy ;
Exposure via breastfeeding ;
Medication error.

Final Protocol Amendment 1, 14 June 2012
Page 408.4.Abnormal Test Findings
The criteria for determining whether an abnormal objective test finding should be reported as 
an AEare as follows: 
Test result is associated with accompan ying symptoms, and/or
Test result requires additional diagnostic testi ng or medical/surgical intervention, 
and/or
Test result leads to a change in stud y dosing or discontinuation from the study, 
significant additional concomitant drug treatment, or other therap y, and/or
Test result is considered to be an AEby the investigator or sponsor.
Merel y repeating an abnormal test, in the absence of an y of the above conditions, does not 
constitute an AE.  An y abnormal test result that is determined to be an error does not require 
reporting as an AE.
8.5.Serious Adverse Events
AnSAE is any untoward medical occurrence at any dose that:
Results in death;
Is life -threatening (immediate risk of death);
Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization;
Results in persistent or significant disability /incapacity (substantial disruption of the 
ability  to conduct normal life functions);
Results in congenital anomaly /birth defect.
Medical and scientific judgment isexercised in determining whether an event is an important 
medical event.  An important medical event may  not be immediately  life-threatening and/or 
result in death or hospitalization.  However, if it is determined that the event may  jeopardize 
the subject or may  require intervention to prevent one of the other AEoutcomes, the 
important medical event should be reported as serious.
Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency  room or at home for 
allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization; 
or development of drug dependency  or drug abuse.

Page 418.5.1. Potential Cases of Drug- Induced Liver Injury 
Abnormal values in aspartate transaminase (AST) and/or alanine transaminase (ALT) 
concurrent with abnormal elevations in total bilirubin that meet the criteria outlined below in 
the absence of other causes of liver injury  are considered potential cases of drug- induced 
liver injury  (potential Hy’s Law cases) and should alway s be considered important medical 
events.  
The threshold of laboratory  abnormalities for a potential case of drug -induced liver injury  
depends on th e subject’s individual baseline values and underl ying conditions. Subjects who 
present with the following laboratory  abnormalities should be evaluated further to 
definitively  determine the etiology  of the abnormal laboratory values:
Subjects with AST or A LT and total bilirubin baseline values within the normal range 
who subsequently  present with AST or AL T 3 times the upper limit of normal (X 
ULN) concurrent with a total bilirubin 2 X UL N with no evidence of hemoly sis and 
an alkaline phosphatase 2X ULN or not available.
For subjects with preexisting ALT OR AST OR total bilirubin values above the 
upper limit of normal, the following threshold values should be used in the definition 
mentioned above:
For subjects with pre -
existing AST or ALT baseline value s above the normal 
range: AST or ALT  2times the baseline values and  3 XULN, or 8 XULN 
(whichever is smaller).
Concurrent with
For subjects with pre -existing values of total bilirubin above the normal range: 
Total bilirubin increased by  one time the u pper limit of normal or ≥3 times the 
upper limit of normal (whichever is smaller).
The subject should return to the investigational site and be evaluated as soon as possible, 
preferabl y within 48 hours from awareness of the abnormal results.  This evaluation should 
include laboratory  tests, detailed history  and phy sical assessment.  In addition to repeating 
AST and ALT, laboratory  tests should include albumin, creatine kinase, total bilirubin, direct 
and indirect bilirubin, gamma -glutam yl transferase, prothrombin time (PT)/I NR, and alkaline 
phosphatase.  A detailed history , including relevant information, such as review of ethanol, 
acetaminophen , recreational drug and supplement consumption, family  history , occupational 
exposure, sexual history , travel histo ry, history  of contact with a jaundiced subject, surgery , 
blood transfusion, history of liver or allergic disease, and work exposure, should be collected.  
Further testing for acute hepatitis A, B, or C infection and liver imaging (eg, biliary  tract) 
may be warranted. All cases confirmed on repeat testing as meeting the laboratory  criteria 
defined above , with no other cause for LFT abnormalities identified at the time should be 
considered potential Hy ’s Law cases irrespective of availability  of all the res
ults of the 
investigations performed to determine etiology  of the abnormal LFTs.  Such potential Hy ’s 
Law cases should be reported as SAEs.

Page 428.6.Hospitalization
AEs reported from studies associated with hospitalization or prolongations of hospitalization 
are co nsidered serious.  Any  initial admission (even if less than 24 hours) to a healthcare 
facility  meets these criteria.  Admission also includes transfer within the hospital to an 
acute/intensive care unit ( eg,from the ps ychiatric wing to a medical floor, me dical floor to a 
coronary  care unit, neurological floor to a tuberculosis unit).
Hospitalization does not include the following:
Rehabilitation facilities;
Hospice facilities;
Respite care (e g,caregiver relief);
Skilled nursing facilities;
Nursing homes;
Routine emergency  room admissions;
Same day  surgeries (as outpatient/same day /ambulatory  procedures).
Hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization in the absence of a precipitating, clinical 
AEis not in itself a nSAE .  Examples include: 
Admission f or treatment of a preexisting condition not associated with the 
development of a new AEor with a worsening of the preexisting condition (eg, for 
work -up of persistent pre- treatment lab abnormality);
Social admission (e g,subject has no place to sleep);
Administrative admission (e g,for yearly physical exam);
Protocol -specified admission during a stud y (eg,for a procedure required by  the study  
protocol);
Optional admission not associated with a precipitating clinical AE(eg,for elective 
cosmetic surgery );
Hospitalization for observation without a medical AE;
Pre-planned treatments or surgical procedures should be noted in the baseline 
documentation for the entire protocol and/or for the individual subject.

Tafamidis
B3461026
Final Protocol Amendment 1, 14 June 2012
Page 43Diagnostic and therapeutic non- invasive and invasi ve procedures, such as surgery , should not 
be reported as AEs .  However, the medical condition for which the procedure was performed 
should be reported if it meets the definition of an AE.  For example, an acute appendicitis 
that begins during the AErepor ting period should be reported as the AE, and the resulting 
appendectomy  should be recorded as treatment of the AE.
8.7.Severity Assessment
If required on the AEcase report forms (CRFs) , the investigator will use the adjectives 
MILD, MODERATE, or SEVERE to de scribe the maximum intensity of the AE.  For 
purposes of consistency , these intensity  grades are defined as follows:
MILD Does not interfere with subject's usual function.
MODERATE Interferes to some extent with subject's usual function.
SEVERE Interfer es significantl y with subject's usual function.
Note the distinction between the severit y and the seriousness of an AE.  A severe event is not 
necessarily  an SAE .  For example, a headache may  be severe (interferes significantly  with 
subject's usual funct ion) but would not be classified as serious unless it met one of the 
criteria for SAE s, listed above.
8.8.Causality Assessment
The investigator’s assessment of causalit y must be provided for all AEs (serious and 
non-serious); the investigator must record the causal relationship in the CRF, as appropriate, 
and report such an assessment in accordance with the serious adverse reporting requirements 
if applicable.  An investigator’s causality  assessment is the determination of whether there 
exists a reasonable poss
ibility  that the investigational product caused or contributed to an 
AE; generally  the facts (evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal relationship should be 
provided.  If the investigator does not know whether or not the investigational product caused 
the event, then the event will be handled as “related to investigational product” for reporting 
purposes, as defined b y the Sponsor (see Section on Reporting Requirements ) .  If the 
investigator's causalit y assessmen t is "unknown but not related to investigational product", 
this should be clearl y documented on study records.  
In addition, if the investigator determines an SAE is associated with study  procedures, the 
investigator must record this causal relationship i n the source documents and CRF, as 
appropriate, and report such an assessment in accordance with the SAE reporting 
requirements, if applicable.

Final Protocol Amendment 1, 14 June 2012
Page 448.9.Exposure During Pregnancy
For investigational products and for marketed products, an exposure during pregnancy  (also 
referred to as exposure in -utero (EIU) occurs if:
1. A female becomes, or is found to be, pregnant either while receiving or being
exposed (eg, due to treatment or environmental exposure) or after discontinuing or 
having been directly  exposed to the inve stigational product;
2. A male has been exposed (eg, due to treatment or environmental exposure) to the 
investigational product prior to or around the time of conception or is exposed during 
his partner’s pregnancy .
If astudy  subject or study  subject’s part ner becomes or is found to be pregnant during the 
study  subject’s treatment with the investigational product, the investigator must submit this 
information to Pfizer on an EIU Form (this is a specific version of the Serious Adverse Event 
Form) .  In additio n, the investigator must submit information regarding environmental 
exposure to a Pfizer product in a pregnant woman (eg, a subject reports that she is pregnant 
and has been exposed to a cy totoxic product by  inhalation or spillage) using the EIUForm.  
This must be done irrespective of whether an AEhas occurred and within 24 hours of 
awareness of the exposure. The information submitted should include the anticipated date of 
delivery  (see below for information related to termination of pregnancy ).
Follow -up is conducted to obtain pregnancy  outcome information for all EIU reports with an 
unknown outcome.  The investigator will follow the pregnancy  until completion or until 
pregnancy  termination) and notify  Pfizer of the outcome as a follow up to the initial EIU
Form.  In the case of a live birth, the structural integrity  of the neonate can be assessed at the 
time of birth.  I n the event of a termination, the reason(s) for termination should be specified 
and, if clinicall y possible, the structural integrit y ofthe terminated fetus should be assessed 
by gross visual inspection (unless pre -
procedure test findings are conclusive for a congenital 
anomaly  and the findings are reported).
If the outcome of the pregnancy  meets the criteria for an SAE (ie, ectopic pregn ancy , 
spontaneous abortion, intrauterine fetal demise, neonatal death, or congenital anomal y [in a 
live born, a terminated fetus, an intrauterine fetal demise, or a neonatal death]), the 
investigator should follow the procedures for reporting SAEs.
Additio nal information about pregnancy outcomes that are reported as SAE s follows: 
Spontaneous abortion includes miscarriage and missed abortion ;
Neonatal deaths that occur within 1 month of birth should be reported, without regard 
to causality , as SAE s.  In addition, infant death safter 1 month should be reported as 
serious adverse events when the investigator assesses the neonatal death as related or 
possibly  related to expo sure to investigational product.

Tafamidis
B3461026
Final Protocol Amendment 1, 14 June 2012
Page 45Additional information regarding the exposure during pr egnancy may be requested by  the 
investigator.  Further follow -up of birth outcomes will be handled on a case- by-case basis 
(eg, follow -up on preterm infants to identify  developmental delay s).In the case of paternal 
exposure, the investigator will provide the study  subject with the EIUPregnant Partner 
Release of Information Form to deliver to his partner. The Investigator must document on 
the EI U Form that the subject was given this letter to provide to his partner.
8.10. Withdrawal Due to Adverse Events (See Also Section 6.3 Subject Withdrawal)
Withdrawal due to AEshould be distinguished from withdrawal due to insufficient response , 
according to the definition of AEnoted earlier, and recorded on the appropriate AECRF 
page.  
When a subject withdraws due to an SAE , the SAE must be reported in accordance with the 
reporting requirements defined below.
8.11. Eliciting Adverse Event Information
The investigator is to report all directly  observed AEs and all AEs spontaneously  reported b y 
the study  subject.  In addition, each study  subject will be questioned about AEs.
8.12. Reporting Requirements
Each AEis to be assessed to determine if it meets the criteria for SAE s.  If a nSAE occurs, 
expedited reporting will follow local and inte rnational regulations, as appropriate.
8.12.1.
Serious Adverse Event Reporting Requirements
If anSAE occurs, Pfizer is to be notified within 24 hours of investigator awareness of the 
event .
In particular, if the SAE is fatal or life -threatening, notification to P fizer must be made 
immediately , irrespective of the extent of available AEinformation.  This timeframe also 
applies to additional new information (follow- up) on previously  forwarded SAE reports as 
well as to the initial and follow- up reporting of exposure during pregnancy and exposure via 
breastfeeding cases.  
In the rare event that the investigator does not become aware of the occurrence of a nSAE
immediately  (eg, if an outpatient study  subject initially  seeks treatment elsewhere), the 
investigator is to report the event within 24 hours after learning of it and document the time 
of his/her first awareness of the AE .
For all SAE s, the investigator is obligated to pursue and provide information to Pfizer in 
accordance with the timeframes for reporting speci fied above.  In addition, an investigator 
may be requested by  Pfizer to obtain specific additional follow -up information in an 
expedited fashion.  This i nformation collected for SAE sismore detailed than that captured 
on the 
AECRF .  In general, this will include a description of the AEin sufficient detail to 

Tafamidis
B3461026
Final Protocol Amendment 1, 14 June 2012
Page 46allow for a complete medical assessment of the case and independent determination of 
possible causality .  Information on other possible causes of the event, such as concomitant 
medications and illnes ses must be provided.  In the case of a subject death, a summary  of 
available autops y findings must be submitted as soon as possible to Pfizer or its designated 
representative. 
8.12.2. Non-Serious Adverse Event Reporting Requirements
All AEs will be reported on the AEpage(s) of the CRF.  I t should be noted that the form for 
collection of SAE information is not the same as the AECRF.  Where the same data are 
collected, the forms must be completed in a consistent manner.  For example, the same AE
term should be us
ed on both forms.  AEs should be reported using concise medical 
terminology  on the CRFs as well as on the form for collection of SAE information.
8.12.3. Sponsor Reporting Requirements to Regulatory Authorities
Adverse event reporting, including suspected serious unexpected adverse reactions, will be 
carried out in accordance with applicable local regulations.
9. DATA ANALYSIS/STATIS TICAL METHODS
Detailed methodology  for summary  and statistical anal yses of the data collected in this study  
will be documented in a Stati stical Analysis Plan, which will be maintained by  the sponsor.  
This document may  modify  the plans outlined in the protocol; however, any  major 
modifications of the primary  endpoint definition and/or its analy sis will also be reflected in a 
protocol amendment.
9.1.Sample Size Determination
There is no formal sample size calculation for this protocol. Subject s who completed 
Protocol Fx1B -201 are eligible; up to 35 subject s are expected to enroll in Protocol 
Fx1B -303.
9.2.Efficacy Analysis
9.2.1. Analysis of Primary Endpoint 
For subject s who enroll into this protocol, the cumulative efficacy  data (starting from 
Protocol Fx1B -201) as measured b y the Patient Global Assessment, NYHA classification, 
KCCQ, 6- minute walk test, echocardiograms, and serum levels of troponin I, tro ponin T, and 
NT-proBNP will be presented. 
Baseline data from protocol Fx1B- 201 will be used as baseline for these analy ses.
Subjects who enroll into the study  and receive an y amount of investigational product will be 
included in the safet y population.  Su bjects who receive any amount of investigational 
product and have at least one post- baseline efficacy  assessment will be included in the 
efficacy  population.

9.5.Safety Analysis
All AE data collected on the CRF will be presented in summar y tables and data listings.
9.6. Interim Analysis
Given the lack of long -term data in TTR -CM, interim analy ses will be performed during the 
course of the stud y to allow for the reporting of safety  and efficacy  data.
9.7.Data Monitoring Committee
This study  will use a Data Monitoring Committee.
The DMC will be responsible for ongoing monitoring of the efficacy  and safet y of subjects in 
the study  according to the Charter.  The recommendations made by  the DMC to alter the 
conduct of the stud y will be forwarded to Pfize r for final decision.  Pfizer will forward such 
decisions, which may  include summaries of aggregate anal yses of endpoint events and of 
safet y data which are not endpoints, to regulatory  authorities, as appropriate.  In this instance, 
such disease -related e fficacy  endpoints are not reported individually  as SAEs. 
10.QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE
During stud y conduct, Pfizer or its agent will conduct periodic monitoring visits to ensure 
that the protocol and Good Clinical Practices ( GCPs )are being follo wed.  The monitors may  
review source documents to confirm that the data recorded on CRFs is accurate.  The 
investigator and institution will allow Pfizer monitors or its agents and appropriate regulatory  
authorities direct access to source documents to per form this verification.

Final Protocol Amendment 1, 14 June 2012
Page 50The study  site may  be subject to review by  the Institutional Review Board (IRB)/ Independent 
Ethics Committee (I EC), and/or to quality  assurance audits performed by  Pfizer, or 
companies working with or on behalf of Pfizer, and/or to inspection by  appropriate 
regulatory  authorities.
It is important that the investigator(s) and their relevant personnel are available during the 
monitoring visits and possible audits or inspections and that sufficient time is devoted to the 
process.
11.DATA H ANDLING AND RECORD K EEPING
11.1. Case Report Forms/Electronic Data Record
As used in this protocol, the term CRF should be understood to refer to either a paper form or 
an electronic data record or both, depending on the data collection method used in this study .
A CRF is required and should be completed for each included subject.  The completed 
original CRFs are the sole propert y of Pfizer and should not be made available in any form to 
third parties, except for authorized representatives of Pfizer or appropriat e regulatory  
authorities, without written permission from Pfizer.
The investigator has ultimate responsibility  for the collection and reporting of all clinical, 
safet y and laboratory data entered on the CRFs and any other data collection forms (source 
docu ments) and ensuring that they  are accurate, authentic / original, attributable, complete, 
consistent, legible, timely  (contemporaneous), enduring and available when required.  The 
CRFs must be signed b y the investigator or b y an authorized staff member to attest that the 
data contained on the CRFs is true. Any corrections to entries made in the CRFs, source 
documents must be dated, initialed and explained (if necessary ) and should not obscure the 
original entry . 
In most cases, the source documents are the hospital's or the phy sician's subject chart.  In 
these cases data collected on the CRFs must match the data in those charts. 
In some cases, the CRF, or part of the CRF, may  also serve as source documents.  I
n these 
cases, a document should be available a t the investigator’s site as well as at Pfizer and clearl y 
identify  those data that will be recorded in the CRF, and for which the CRF will stand as the 
source document.
11.2. Record Retention
To enable evaluations and/or audits from regulatory  authorities or Pf izer, the investigator 
agrees to keep records, including the identit y of all participating subjects (sufficient 
information to link records, e g,CRFs and hospital records), all original signed informed 
consent documents , copies of all CRFs, safety  reportin gforms, source documents, and 
detailed records of treatment disposition, and adequate documentation of relevant 
correspondence (eg, letters, meeting minutes, telephone calls reports).  The records should be 

Tafamidis
B3461026
Final Protocol Amendment 1, 14 June 2012
Page 51retained b y the investigator according to Intern ational Conference on Harmonisation ( ICH), 
local regulations, or as specified in the Clinical Study  Agreement (CSA) , whichever is 
longer.
If the investigator becomes unable for an y reason to continue to retain study records for the 
required period (eg, ret irement, relocation), Pfizer should be prospectivel y notified.  The 
study  records must be transferred to a designee acceptable to Pfizer , such as another 
investigator, another institution, or to an independent third part y arranged by Pfizer. 
Investigator records must be kept for a minimum of 15 y ears after completion or 
discontinuation of the study or for longer if required by  applicable local re gulations.
The investigator must obtain Pfizer's written permission before disposing of an y records, 
even if ret ention requirements have been met.
12.ETHICS
12.1. Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC)
It is the responsibility  of the investigator to have prospective approval of the study  protocol, 
protocol amendments, informed consent documents, and other relevant documents, e g,
recruitment advertisements, if applicable, from the IRB/IEC.  All correspondence with the 
IRB/IEC should be retained in the Investigator File.  Copies of IRB/IEC approvals should be 
forwarded to Pfizer.
The only  circumstan ce in which an amendment may  be initiated prior to IRB/IEC approval is 
where the change is necessary  to eliminate apparent immediate hazards to the subjects.  In 
that event, the investigator must notify  the IRB/IEC and Pfizer in writing immediately  after 
the implementation.
12.2. Ethical Conduct of the Study
The study  will be conducted in accordance with legal and regulatory  requirements, as well as 
the general principles set forth in the International Ethical Guidelines for Biomedical 
Research Involving Human Subjects (Council for International Organizations of Medical 
Sciences 2002), Guidelines for GCP (ICH 1996), and the Declaration of Helsinki (World 
Medical Association 2008). 
In addition, the study  will be conducted in accordance with the protocol, the ICH guideline 
on GCP , and applicable local regulatory  requirements and laws.
12.3. Subject Information and Consent
All parties will ensure protection of subject personal data and will not include subject names 
on any  sponsor forms, reports, publications, or in any  other disclosures, except where
required b y laws.

Tafamidis
B3461026
Final Protocol Amendment 1, 14 June 2012
Page 52Subject names, address, birth date and other identifiable data will be replaced by a numerical 
code consisting of a numbering s ystem provided by  Pfizer in order to de -identify  the trial 
subject .In case of data transfer, Pfizer will maintain high standards of confidentiality  and 
protection of subject personal data.
The informed consent document must be in compliance with ICH GCP, local regulatory  
requirements, and legal requirements.
The informed consent document used in this study, and any  changes made during the course 
of the study , must be prospectively  approved by  both the I RB/IEC and Pfizer before use.
The investigator must ensure that each study  subject, or his/her legal representative, is fully  
informe d about the nature and objectives of the study  and possible risks associated with 
participation.  
The investigator, or a person designated b y the investigator, will obtain written informed 
consent from each subject or the subject's legal representative be fore an y study -specific 
activity  is performed. The investigator will retain the original of each subject's signed 
consent document .
12.4. Reporting of Safety Issues and S erious Breaches of the Protocol or ICH GCP
In the event of an y prohibition or restriction imposed (ie, clinical hold) b y an applicable 
Competent Authority  in any  area of the World, or if the investigator is aware of any  new 
information which might influence the evaluation of the benefits and risks of the 
investigational product, Pfizer should be informed immediately .  
In addition, the investigator will inform Pfizer immediately  of any  urgent safet y measures 
taken b y the investigator to protect the study subjects against an y immediate hazard, and of 
any serious breaches of this protocol or of ICH GCP that the investigator becomes aware of.
13.DEFINITION OF END OF TRIAL
End of Trial in all participating countries is defined as Last Subject Last Visit.
14.SPONSOR DISCONTINUAT ION CRITERIA
Premature termination of this study  may  occur because of a regulator y authority  decision, 
change in opinion of the IRB/IEC, drug safet y problems, or at the discretion of Pfizer.  In 
addition, Pfizer retains the right to discontinue development of tafamidis at any  time.
If a stud y is prematurel y terminated or discontinued, Pfizer will promptly  notify  the 
investigator.  After notification, the investigator must contact all participating subjects and 
the hospital pharmacy  (if applicable) within 28 day s.  As directed b y Pfizer, all study  
materials must be collected and all CRFs completed to the greatest extent possible.

Page 5315.PUBLICATION OF STUDY RESULTS
Publication of study  results is discussed in the CSA .
15.1. Communication of Results by Pfizer
Pfizer fulfi lls its commitment to publicly  disclose clinical trial results through posting the
results of this study  on www.clinicaltrials.gov (ClinicalTrials.gov) .  Pfizer posts the results of 
all 
studies that it has registered on ClinicalTrials.gov regardless of the reason for registration.
The r esults are posted in a tabular format called Basic Results. 
For studies involving a Pfizer product, the timing of the posting depends on whether the 
Pfizer product is approved for marketing in an y country  at the time the study  is completed:
For studies involving products applicable under the US Food and D rug 
Administration Amendments Act of 2007 (FDAAA), ie, FDA -approved products, 
Pfizer posts results within one year of the primary outcome completion date (PCD). 
For studies involving products approved in an y country , but not FDA approved, 
Pfizer posts results one year from last subject, last visit (L SLV). 
For studies involving products that are not yet approved in an y countr y, Pfizer posts 
the results of alread y
-completed studies within 30 day s ofUS regulatory  approval , or 
one y ear after the first ex
-US regulatory  approval of the product (if onl y submitted for 
approval ex -US);
For studies involving products whose drug development is discontinued before 
approval, Pfizer posts the results within one y ear of discontinuation of the program (if 
there are no pl ans for outlicensing or within two years if outlicensing plans have not 
completed).
Primary  Completion Date is defined as the date that the final subject was examined or 
received an intervention for the purposes of final collection of data for the primary  outcome, 
whether the clinical trial concluded according to the pre
-specified protocol or was 
terminated.
15.2. Publications by Investigators
Pfizer has no objection to publication by  Investigator of any  information collected or 
generated b y Investigator, whether or not the results are favorable to the Investigational 
Drug.  However, to ensure against inadvertent disclosure of Confidential Information or 
unprotected Inventions, Investigator will provide Pfizer an opportunity  to review an y 
proposed publication or o ther ty pe of disclosure before it is submitted or otherwise disclosed.

Page 54Investigator will provide manuscripts, abstracts, or the full text of any  other intended 
disclosure (poster presentation, invited speaker or guest lecturer presentation, etc.) to Pfizer
at least 30 day s before they  are submitted for publication or otherwise disclosed.  If an y 
patent action is required to protect intellectual property rights, Investigator agrees to delay  
the disclosure for a period not to exceed an additional 60 day s.
Investigator will, on request, remove an y previously undisclosed Confidential I nformation 
(other than the Stud y results themselves) before disclosure.
If the Study  is part of a multi -centre study , Investigator agrees that the first publication is to 
be a joint publication covering all centers.  However, if a joint manuscript has not been 
submitted for publication within 12 months of completion or termination of the Study  at all 
participating sites, Investigator is free to publish separately , subject to the oth er requirements 
of this Section.
For all publications relating to the Study , Institution will comply  with recognized ethical 
standards concerning publications and authorship, including Section II -“Ethical 
Considerations in the Conduct and Reporting of Re search” of the Uniform Requirements for 
Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical Journals, http://www.icmje.org/index.html#authorship, 
established by the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors.
Publication of study  results is also provided for in th e Clinical Study  Agreement between 
Pfizer and the institution.  I n this section entitled Publications by  Investigators, the defined 
terms shall have the meanings given to them in the Clinical Study  Agreement.

New York Heart Association (NYHA) Classification:
Class I
Patients with cardiac disease but without resulting limitations of phy sical activity .  Ordinary  
physical activity  does not cause undue fatigue, palpitation, dy spnea, or anginal pain.
Class II
Patients with cardiac disease resulting in slight limitation of phy sical activity .  They  are 
comfortable at rest.  Ordinary  physical acti vity results in fatigue, palpitation, dy spnea, or 
anginal pain.
Class III
Patients with cardiac disease resulting in marked limitation of phy sical activity .  They  are 
comfortable at rest.  Less than ordinary  physical activity  causes fatigue, palpitation, d yspnea, 
or anginal pain.
Class IV
Patients with cardiac disease resulting in inability  to carry  on any  physical activity  without 
discomfort.  Sy mptoms of cardiac insufficiency  or of the anginal s yndrome may be present 
even at rest.  If an y physical activit y is undertaken, discomfort is increased.

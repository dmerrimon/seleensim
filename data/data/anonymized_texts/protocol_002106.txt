SYNOPSIS  
Title:  
A Multicenter, Randomized, Double -Blind, Parallel -Group, Vehicle -Controlled Study of 
the Safety and Efficacy of DFD -03 Lotion in the Treatment of Acne Vulgaris for 
12 Weeks  
Sponsor:    Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories, Ltd  
  8-2-337, Road No. 3  
  Banjara Hills  
 Hyderabad – 500034, Telangana, India  
Study Centers:  25 to 35 sites  Number of Subjects:  Approximately 550  
Study Period:  12 weeks  Clinical Phase:  Phase 3  
Objective:  
The objective s of this study are to compare the efficacy and safety of DFD -03 Lotion to Vehicle 
Lotion in subject s with  acne vulgaris after 12  weeks of topical treatment.  
Methods:   
This will be a multicenter, randomized, double -blind, parallel group, vehicle -controlled  study .  
Subjects with mild to moderate facial acne vulgaris will be randomized to either of the two arms 
in a 1:1 ratio:  
Arm 1: DFD -03 Lotion  
Arm 2: Vehicle Lotion   
Enrollment of subjects with mild acne (IGA Grade 2) at each site will be restricted to no more 
than 20% of total enrollment at that site. Subjects with acne lesions of any severity on the chest 
and/or back (including shoulders)  may be enrol led provided they have mild to moderate acne on 
the face. During the 12 -week treatment period subjects will use the study product  twice daily 
with approximately 12 hours between applications. Subjects will be instru cted to treat the entire 
face (and chest /back  including shoulders , if applicable ). The investigator will assess efficacy by 
using an Investigator ’s Global Assessment scale (IGA 5-point  scale) and by counting the 
number of inflammatory and non-inflammatory  lesions on the face at Baseline  and Weeks  4, 8, 
and 12. Lesion counts will also be done for the chest /back  (including shou lders) , where  
applicable . The IGA should always be done prior to lesion counts.  
 
Safety assessments will include the investigator’s assessment of local cutaneous tolerance of the 
treated skin  (dryness , non -lesional erythema, peeling, stinging, burning, and  itching ; assessed 
separately on the chest/back  including shoulders  (if applicable ), vital signs (blood pressure and 
pulse rate) , and adverse events  (AEs) . Urine pregnancy tes ts will be performed at Baseline and 
at every visit through Week  12 for all female  subjects.  A physical examination will be 
performed at the Baseline Visit.

The Cardiff Acne Disability Index  (CADI) will be used to assess the quality of life in all 
subjects  at Baseline (Day 1) and at Weeks 4, 8 and 12.  
 
Subjects will assess the severity of their facial acne using the Subject’s Global Assessment scale 
(SGA)  at Baseline and at every visit through Week 12. Subject  quality of life and treatment 
satisfaction will  also be evaluated using the Dermatol ogy Life Quality Index (DLQI)  at 
Baseline , Weeks 4, 8, and 12. For  subjects ≤ 16 years of age the children’s DLQI  will be used .  
 
Number of Subjects:  
Approximately 550 subjects  will be enrolled in about 25 to 35 centers.

Page 7 of 62 
 
Investigational Product, Dose and Mode of Administrati on: 
DFD -03 Lotion (0.1% tazarotene)  
 
Subjects will apply a quarter (U.S coin) size amount of the study product all over the moistened 
face and rub  it into the skin until foamy . Care should be taken to avoid the areas around the 
eyes, mouth, and nostrils. Additional 1 -2 quarter size amounts of the study product may be used 
over other affected areas (chest and/or back, including shoulders) . After being left on for 1 
minute, the subject will rinse off the product by thoroughly rinsing  with warm water for abou t 
30 seconds.  This procedure will be followed twice daily , in the morning and at bedtime, 
approximately 12 hours apart.  
 
Duration of Treatment and Study:  
Subjects will treat the entire face , including the nose (and chest and/or back , including 
shoulders , if applicable) twice daily for 12 weeks. The total study duration including the 
screening period will be approximately 12  to 20  weeks.  
 
Reference and Control Products, Dose and Mode of Administration:  
Vehicle : DFD -03 Vehicle Lotion (0% tazarotene)  
 
The control product will be applied similarly to the study product as described above.  
 
Criteria for Evaluation:  
Safety criteria:  
The primary safety endpoint will be treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs). Other s afety 
variables include  local cutaneous tolerance evaluation  (dryness , non -lesional erythema, peeling, 
stinging, burning, and  itching ) and vital signs (blood pressure and pulse rate) .   
Efficacy criteria:  
The co -primary endpoints are:  
 The absolute change from Baseline to Week 12  in the inflammatory (papules and 
pustules)  lesion counts on the face  
 The absolute change from Baseline to Week 12 in the  non-inflammatory  (open and 
closed comedones) lesion counts  on the face  
 Proportion of subject s with a clinical response of “success” at  Week 12  for lesions on the 
face. Success based on IGA is defined as an IGA score of 0 (Clear)  or 1 (Almost clear)  
at Week 12 with at  least a 2 -grade reduction from B aseline .   
 
The secondary endpoints  are: 
1. Percent change from Baseline to Week 12 in inflam matory lesion counts on the face .  
2. Percent change from Baseline to Week 12 in non -inflammatory lesion counts on the 
face.  
 
The exploratory e ndpoints  are: 
 
 
 
 
 
Version 6.0 (Amendment 05) 
DFD -03 Lotion  
Protocol DFD -03-CD-006 
Page 8 of 62 
1. Time to 50% reduction in total lesion counts on the face.  
2. Absolute change from Baseline in inflammatory, non -inflammatory and total lesion 
counts on the face at Weeks 4 and 8 . 
3. Percent change from Baseline in inflammatory, non -inflammatory, and total lesion 
counts on the face at Weeks 4 and 8.  
4. Proportion of subjects with an IGA score of 0 or 1 with at least a 2 -grade reduction (for 
the face) from Baseline at Weeks 4 and 8 . 
5. Change from Baseline in Children’s DLQI total score in subjects 16  years of age or 
younger at Weeks 4 , 8, and 12. 
6. Change from Baseline in DLQI score  in subjects >16 years of a ge at Weeks 4, 8 and 12.  
7. Percent change from Baseline in inflammatory, non -inflammatory and total lesion counts 
on the chest and /or back  including shoulders  (in relevant subjects ) at Weeks 4, 8, and 12.  
8. Time to 50% reduction in total lesion counts on the chest and /or back  (including 
shoulders) . 
9. Proportion of subjects with at least a 2 -grade improvement from Baseline in the SGA  at 
Week 12.   
10. Change from Baseline in CADI score at Weeks 4 , 8 and 12. 
 
If the statistical analysis for  all the co -primary endpoints  achieves p<0.05, statistical analysis for 
the secondary endpoints will use a sequential  approach according to a pre -specified order: 
percent change in inflammatory lesion counts  on the face, and then p ercent change in non-
inflammatory lesion counts  on the  face. If p<0.05 is achieved for a higher ranking secondary 
variable, then success will be declared for the variable, and statistical comparisons will be 
performed for the lower ranking variable. If p<0.05 is not achieved for a higher ranking 
variable, the n statistical comparisons will be considered descriptive (non -inferential) for this 
variable and for the lower ranking secondary variable.  
The sample size was estimated based on the primary study endpoints and statistics available 
from the Summary Basis of  Approval for Tazorac® (tazarotene) Gel (NDA 20 -600). The total 
sample size  of 550 will provide  an overall power of at least 90% based on a 2 -tailed alpha of 
0.05. 
 
Approximately  550 subjects  (275 for each treatment arm)  will be randomized  and about 25 to 35  
sites will participate in the study

1 INTRODUCTION  
Tazarotene, an acetylenic  retinoid, is a prodrug that undergoes rapid and complete metabolism 
to its active metabolite tazarotenic acid ( Chandraratna, 1996 ). Retinoids are a class of 
keratolytic drugs derived from retinoic acid used for the treatment of acne and psoriasis. Several  
synthetic retinoids have been developed for topical treatment of acne.  
Tazarotene was initially developed in gel formulation and subsequently in cream and foam 
formulations. Products containing tazarotene have been proven to be effective in the treatment 
of acne vulgaris and psoriasis, as well as being effective in the mitigation (palliation) of facial 
fine wrinkling, facial mottled hyper - and hypopigmentation, and benign facial lentigines.  
Dr. Reddy’ s Laboratories has developed DFD -03 Lotion, a new formul ation containing 0.1% 
tazarotene for the topical treatment of acne vulgaris. This new product is intended to be used as 
a face wash twice daily. Treatment use will begin by applying a generous amount of product to 
moistened affected skin, rubbing until foa my, and then rinsing with water after 1  minute.  
Acne vulgaris is characterized by a mixture of inflammatory lesions (papules, pustules, and 
nodular cystic lesions) and non -inflammatory lesions (open and closed comedones) ( Shalita, 
2004 ). The four primary f actors contributing to acne are abnormal follicular epithelial 
desquamation, hyperactivity of the sebaceous glands, proliferation of Propionibacterium acnes , 
and perifollicular inflammation.  
 Current ly available treatments for acne vulgaris include oral an d topical antibiotics, topical 
benzoyl peroxide, topical salicylic acid, topical adapalene, topical azelaic acid, topical dapsone, 
oral and topical retinoids (including tazarotene), and phototherapy.  
Tazarotene is a well -characterized active ingredient, an d many studies have been conducted on 
its pharmacology, toxicology and clinical efficacy and safety  (Fabior Prescribing Information , 
Tazorac Cream Prescribing Information ). 
Tazarotene is characterized by the FDA as a Category X drug, indicating that it may  or can 
cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman and is contraindicated in women who 
are or may become pregnant  (Menter, 2000 ). At least 6 women are known to have become 
pregnant during clinical studies with tazarotene and all reported the bi rth of healthy babies, 
although the timing and extent of exposure in relation to the gestation time are unknown in these 
cases .  
The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of DFD -03 Lotion  for topical 
treatment of acne vulgaris  over 12 weeks of treatment.   
More information about DFD -03 Lotion can be found in the Investigator’s Brochure.  
2 ETHICALCONSIDERATION S 
2.1 Institutional  Review Board Review  
The protocol, protocol amendments, s ubject recruiting materials,  the informed consent form , 
and any other materials provided to subjects  must be approved by an institutional review b oard 
(IRB) operating in c ompliance with 21 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 56. A copy of 
 
 
 
 
 
Version 6.0 (Amendment 05) 
DFD -03 Lotion  
Protocol DFD -03-CD-006 
Page 16 of 62 
the approval letter must be received by the sponsor or contract resea rch organization ( CRO ) 
prior to shipment of drug supplies to the site.  
Records of the IRB’s  review and approval of all documents pertaining to the study must be kept 
on file by the investigator and are subject to sponsor and Food and Drug Administration ( FDA) 
inspection at any time .   
 
2.2 Ethical  Conduct of Study  
The investigator will ensure that this study is conducted in full conformity with the principles 
set forth in 21 CFR Part 50 – Protection of Human Subjects and in the Declaration of Helsinki 
(2013) (see Appendix  1).  
 
2.3 Informed Consent  
Written informed consent must be obtained before a subject can participate in the study, prior to 
performing any study related procedures, and before withdrawal of any therapies prohibited 
during the study. Informed conse nt is a process that is initiated prior to the subject’s agreement 
to participate in the study and continuing throughout the subject’s study participation. The 
process involves an extensive discussion with the subject about the study procedures and the 
risks and possible benefits of participation in the study.  
For subjects under the age of majority in the state they are enrolled, the subject’s parent or legal 
guardian will be required to sign the informed consent form  and the subject will sign an IRB-
approved “ information and assent ” form before the subje ct is enrolled into the study.  
A copy of the signed consent form and ‘information and assent form ’ (when applicable) will be 
given to every subject and the original will be maintained with the subjec t’s records.  
 
2.4 Selection  of Investigators  
Investigators for the study should be board -certified dermatologists licensed in the state where 
the study is being conducted, with knowledge and understanding of Good Clinical Practice 
(GCP) and experience in treat ing acne vulgaris . In some cases, qualified physicians who are not 
board -certified dermatologists may participate based on training and experience in the treatment 
of acne vulgaris . Sub-investigators may be licensed physicians, physician assistants, or nur se 
practitioners with experience in treating acne vulgaris  or in dermatology  and a good 
understanding of GCP . Investigators may delegate study tasks to other site personnel as long as 
they are qualified to perform the task.   
3 STUDY  OBJECTIVES  
The objective s of this study are to compare the efficacy and safety of DFD -03 Lotion to Vehicle 
Lotion in subject s with  acne vulgaris after 12 weeks of topical treatment.  
4 STUDY  DESIGN  
This will be a multicenter, randomized, vehicle -controlled, double -blind, parallel -group  study . 
Approximately  550 subjects with mild to moderate facial acne vulgaris will be randomized in a 
1:1 ratio  to treatment with either  DFD -03 Lotion  or Vehicle Lotion . Enrollment of subjects with 
 
 
 
 
 
Version 6.0 (Amendment 05) 
DFD -03 Lotion  
Protocol DFD -03-CD-006 
Page 17 of 62 
mild acne (IGA Grade 2) at each site will be restrict ed to no more than 20% of total enrollment 
at that site.  During the 12 -week treatment period subjects will use the study drug twice daily 
with approximately 12 hours between applications. Subjects will be instru cted to treat the entire 
face (and chest and/ or back (including shoulders) , if applicable) . The investigator will assess 
efficacy by using an Investigator ’s Global Assessment scale (IGA , 5-point scale) and by 
counting the number of inflammatory and non-inflammatory  lesions on the face at Baseline and 
Weeks 4, 8, and 12. Lesion counts will also be done for the chest and/or back (including 
shoulders) , where applicable.  
The p rimary safety endpoint will be treatment -emergent adverse events  (TEAEs) . Other safety 
assessments will include the investigator’s assessment of local cutaneous tolerance  (dryness , 
non-lesional erythema, peeling, stinging , burning, and  itching ) and vital signs (blood pressure 
and pulse rate) . A physical examination will be performed at Baseline. Urine pregnancy tests 
will be performed at Baseline and at every visit through Week 12 for all female subjects.  
The co -primary efficacy endpoints are:  
 
1. The absolute change from Baseline to Week 12 in the inflammatory (papules and 
pustules)  lesion counts  on the face    
2. The absolute change from Baseline to Week 12 in the  non-inflammatory  (open and 
closed comedones) lesion counts  on the face  
3. Proportion of subject s with a clinical response of “success” at Week 12  for lesions on the 
face. Success based on IGA is defined as a n IGA score of 0 (Clear)  or 1 (Almost clear)  
at Week  12 with at  least a 2-grade reduction from B aseline .   
The secondary endpoints  are: 
 
1. Percent change from Baseline to Week 12 in inflammatory lesion counts on the face .  
2. Percent change from Baseline to Week 12 in non -inflammatory lesion counts on the 
face.  
The exploratory e ndpoints  are: 
 
1. Time to 50% reduction in total lesion counts on the face.  
 
2. Absolute change from Baseline in inflammatory, non -inflammatory and total lesion 
counts on the face at Weeks 4  and 8 . 
3. Percent change from Baseline in inflammatory, non -inflammatory, and total lesion 
counts on the face at Weeks 4 and 8.  
4. Proportion of subjects with an IGA score of 0 or 1 with at least a 2 -grade reduction (for 
the face) from Baseline at Weeks 4 and 8 . 
5. Change from Baseline in Children’s DLQI total score in subjects 16  years of age or 
younger at Weeks 4 , 8, and 12. 
6. Change from Baseline in DLQI score in subjects >16 years of age at Weeks 4, 8 and 12.  
7. Percent change from Baseline in inflammatory, non -inflammatory and total lesion counts 
on the chest and /or back  including shoulders  (in relevant subjects ) at Weeks 4, 8, and 12.

instructions for use, and sponsor name and address. In addition, there will be a place to write the 
subject number and subject initials. The bottle label will also have a tear -off panel that includes 
the protocol number  and unique bottle number. The tear -off panel is to be affixed to the source 
document and  filed in subject’s chart.  
 
6.1.3 Accountability  
Documentation of receipt, study product  inventory, and return shipments of the study product  
must be maintained at each study site. Upon receipt of the study product  supplies, an inventory 
must be performed. It is  important that site personnel count and verify that the shipment 
contains all the items noted in the shipment record  and that they are in good condition . At study 
completion, all bottles of study product , used and unused, must be returned to the sponsor o r 
designee .  
In addition, an Investigational Product Dispensing Record  showing dispensing to and return by 
subjects must be maintained at each study site. Any dispensed bottles  that are not returned to the 
clinic must be documented on the log.  
 
6.1.4 Dispensing and Return  
At the Baseline Visit (Visit 2) , 2 bottles of study product will be  assigned by the interactive 
web-based system (IWRS) and will be  dispensed to subjects who will apply to the face only and 
4 bottles will be dispensed to subjects who will apply to the face and chest and/or back 
(including shoulders) . At subsequent visits, a dditional bottles  will be assigned by the IWRS and 
dispensed as needed  from the same assigned  treatment . Partially used  bottles  can be re -
dispensed  to the subject . The specific  study product bottle  to be dispensed for each subject will 
be identified  by using IWRS.  The tear -off panel is to be affixed to the source document and 
filed in the subject’s chart. Subject initials  and subject number must be written on the bottle  
label. Study staff will then dispense and instruct the subject on study product  use. The subject 
will be provided with a copy of the subject instructions.    
Dispensing and return of study product  must be documented on the Investigational Product 
Dispensing Record . 
Subjects must return the used bottles  even i f empty throughout the trial. At the end of the trial, 
all used and unused bottles  must be returned to the clinic for eventual destruction by the sponsor

or designee . Any dispensed bottles  that are not returned to the clinic must be documented on the 
log.  
 
6.1.5 Storage  
Study product  must be kept in a secure room temperature -controlled/monitored space at 
20°-25°C (68° -77°F); excursions are permitted  to 15°-30°C (59 °-86°F).   
 
6.2 Treatment Regimen  
Subjects will use the study product  twice  daily with approximately 12 hours between 
applications  for 12 weeks  starting on Day 1 during the study visit . The f irst application will be 
done at the clinic and supervised b y site staff. If the fi rst on-site application occurs later in the 
afternoon  (e.g. at or after 4 pm), this application  will be considered the pm dose. Treatment use 
will begin by moistening  facial  skin with luke warm tap water.  Subjects will then be instructed to 
dispense a quarter (U.S. coin) size amount  of study product into the palm of their hand and then 
apply over the  entire  face, delineated by the hairline, jaw -line and ears  and including the nose 
(avoiding the areas around the eyes, mouth and nostrils) , with the tip of a finger.  For subjects 
with acne  on chest and/or back (including shoulders) , an additional 1 -2 quarter size amount of 
the treatment will be similarly applied. Subjects should then  rub the treated areas  for 5 to 10 
secon ds unt il foamy, wait approximately 1 minute (a timer will be provided), and then rinse  
thoroughly with lukewarm tap water  for about 30 seconds, being careful to close eyes tightly . A 
washcloth should not be used on the face but can be used for the chest and /or back including 
shoulders . 
The first and last dates of treatment and the number of study product ap plications made on these 
dates should be recorded on the electronic case report form (e CRF ). The total number of 
applications (including those on the first and  last days) and the number of missed applications 
should also be recorded  by reference to the diary . By definition there are no missed applications 
before the first date of treatment or after the last date of treatment.    
Heavy make -up used to cover -up ble mishes and sunscreen should be removed before study 
product application using a gentle cleanser approved by the investigator, such as Cetaphil 
Gentle Skin Cleanser , etc. 
Subjects will be allowed  to use an investigator -approved  cleanser, face wash, sunscreen, and /or 
non-comedogenic moisturizer  with SPF daily on the face. Subjects will be instructed to continue 
to use their  investigator - approved products for the duration of the study and should avoid any 
changes in these consumer products.  
 
6.3 Treatment  and Protocol Compliance  
Subjects will be provided an  instruction sheet. Study staff should review the instruction sheet 
with the subjects to ensure protocol compliance.  
At each visit, the investigator or designee will interview subjects concerning treatm ent 
compliance and ask if any doses have been missed. The study product bottles will be weighed 
prior to being dispensed and weighed again when the bottle is returned. If the study product 
 
 
 
 
 
Version 6.0 (Amendment 05) 
DFD -03 Lotion  
Protocol DFD -03-CD-006 
Page 25 of 62 
bottle still contains study product it should be re -dispensed to th e subject after it is weighed.  
Additional bottles should be dispensed as needed. The  investigator will also ask about 
compliance with protocol requirements . Protocol deviations will be reco rded in the subject’s 
chart  and Protocol Deviation Form  and included in the study report . A Protocol  Deviation Form  
is not needed for missed visits, missed applications, out -of-window visits , or missing data. 
These items will be apparen t from the missing data on the eCRF and will be identified 
programmatically duri ng data analysis for purposes of reporting. The s ponsor should be 
consulted before discontinuing subjects due  to protocol deviations unless safety is a concern.  
In addition, subjects will be provided a diary card for documenting the time and dates of  
appli cation s. The subjects will review the diary card with the investigator or designee at each 
visit. The number of applied and  missed applic ations will be recorded on the eCRF.   
 
6.4 Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups  
Subjects will be assigned rando mly to one of the two treatment groups  in a 1:1 ratio ( 275 for 
DFD -03 Lotion and 275 for Vehicle Lotion ).  
IWRS will randomize each subject to a treatment group by site based on the subject’s IGA score 
in order for each site to maintain a 1:1 ratio within each IGA stratum. IWRS will assign a bottle 
(designated by a number) to be dispensed, based on the treatment assignment from the inventory 
available at the site. IWRS will restrict each site from enrolling no more than 20% of enrolled 
subjects with IGA sco re of 2 (mild).  The date and time of randomization and  the bottle  number 
should be entered on the eCRF.  
The investigator shall ensure that study product s are only used by subjects under the 
investigator's personal supervision or under the supervision of a sub-investigator responsible to 
the investigator and in accordance with the protocol.  
 
6.5 Blinding  
6.5.1 Method  of Blinding  
This is a double -blind , vehicle -controlled study . The primary and secondary container s and the 
product appearance of the DFD -03 Lotion  and Vehicle Lotion  will be identical. All subjects , 
study site, CRO personnel , statisticians, and sponsor staff  will be completely blinded .  
 
6.5.2 Unblinding  
The blind should be broken for all SAE IND safety reports that are judged to be  expedited 
reports for submission to FDA.  The unblinding procedures and follow -up will be performed in 
accordance with the  protocol and the  CRO ’s standard operating procedures (SOPs).  The blind 
should not be broken at the study site level except in a medical emergency  (where kno wledge of 
the study medication received would affect the treatment of the  emergency). For a medical 
emergency, the blind must only be broken following  discussion on a case -by-case basis, at the 
discretion of the Investigator/treating  physician/Sponsor.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
Version 6.0 (Amendment 05) 
DFD -03 Lotion  
Protocol DFD -03-CD-006 
Page 26 of 62 
If the blind is broken, the date, time, and reason must be recorded in the subject’s  source record, 
eCRF, and any associated AE report.  If an Investigator, site personnel performing assessments, 
or subject  is unblinded, the  unblinding incident and unblinded subject  must be listed as a major 
protocol deviation.  A subject  for whom the blind is broken will discontinue study medication  
and be  scheduled for a safety follow -up visit and then discontinued from the study. The subject  
will be encouraged to stay in th e study until the AE is resolved or stabilized.  All Investigators 
and the IRB will receive  blinded reports. However, on the request of the IRB, the Sponsor will 
send unblinded  reports directly to the IRB.  
 
6.6 Prior and Concomitant  Therapy  and Procedures  
Chronic medications being used at the time of the Screening and Baseline Visit, with the 
exception of those specified as prohibited, may be continued at the discretion of the investigator. 
History of medications, therapies , and procedures is collected from  the prior 6 -month period for 
determination of eligibility. Only medications, therapies and procedures in use during the study 
should be entered on the eCRF.  
New medications used after baseline  required for another medical condition, that in the opinion 
of the investigator will have no material impac t on the study, are permitted. The addition of such 
a new medication during the study will be documented as a concomitant medication and the 
associated medical need must be recorded as an AE, if applicable .   
All medications (topical, oral, prescription, over -the-counter, and herbal medications) and 
medical therapies or procedures  that are used during the study for other diseases/conditions must 
be recorded on the eCRF.  
Subjects will only be allowed to use  a non-medicated  investigator -approved  gentle cleanser , 
facial wash, sunscreen, and /or non-comedogenic moisturizer  with SPF , and make -up.   
Subjects should be instructed to refrain from making any significant change  in the use of 
consumer products during the cou rse of the study. Any changes will be captured in the source 
documents and eCRF.  The name and the date that the new product was started will be recorded.  
See Table  2 for a list of medications and procedures that  are prohibited during the study.  
 
6.7 Study Restrictions  
Only the assigned study product  and non-medicated investigator -approved  
sunscreen /moisturize r with SPF , gentle cleanser , face wash, and make -up should be applied to 
the face  during the study .  
Subjects must be willing to comply with sun avoidance measures for the face  (and chest and/or 
back (including shoulders) , if applicable)  including use of non-medicated investigator -approved  
sunscreen and/or hats, have limited  sun exposure time , and have no tanning bed use.

7 STUDY PROCEDURES  AND EVALUATIONS  
7.1 Informed Consent  Process  
Informed consent must be obtained before a subject can participate in the study, prior to 
performing any study related procedures and before withdrawal of any therapie s prohibited 
during the study. The investigator must discuss the study fully with the subject  (and legal 
guardian, as applicable) . Subjects must demonstrate their willingness to participate in the study 
and comply with the study procedures by giving written informed consent  or written assent, as 
applicable . The consent form and ‘information and assent ’ form must be signed and dated by the 
subject  or legal guardian, as applicable . A copy of the consent form (and ‘information and 
assent form ’, as applicable) must be given to the subject and/or legal guardian, and the date of 
the consent process and who conducted the consent process must be documented in the source 
docu ments.  
 
7.2 Screening  
A separate Screening Visit (Visit 1) may be performed when a wash out period is required  or for 
scheduling purposes . Alternatively, Visit s 1 and 2 may be combined  if no wash out period  is 
required . The subject number, date of visit, date of  consent, reason for screen failure, and study 
status  (screen failure ) will be captured in the  eCRF  for every screen failure subject.  The 
Baseline Visit  2 must occur no later than 60 days after the Screening Visit.  Medical history and 
acne history should b e collected for the prior 1 -year period and concomitant medications , 
therapies , and procedures  collected for the prior 6 -month period. Only ongoing medical 
conditions and ongoing concomitant medications should be entered on the eCRF. Acne history 
will be c ollected and recorded in the eCRF.  
A screen failure is a subject who received information about the study, including signing an 
informed consent and  possibly performing some study -related procedures , but was not 
randomized and/or did not use  study product.  
 
7.3 Demographic and Baseline Characteristics  
Demographic variables include age (computed from date of birth and Baseline Visit date), race, 
ethnicity , and sex.  Baseline characteristics are the baseline values for the efficacy variables – 
inflammatory lesion count, non-inflammatory  lesion count , and IGA. The IGA should always be 
done prior to lesion counts.  
 
7.4 Fitzpatrick Skin Type Assessment  
The Fitzpatrick skin scale (Fitzpatrick, 1988; Table  3) classifies a person ’s complexion and 
tolerance of sunlight. It is commonly used by many practitioners to determine how someone will 
respond or react to facial treatments, and how likely they are t o get skin cancer.  
The Fitzpatrick Classification Scale will be performed at Day 1 (Baseline) prior to the first 
application of study medication and will be recorded in the subject’s source document and CRF.

7.5 Efficacy Assessments  
The investigator will be responsible for all clinical evaluations, with best attempts made to 
assign the same evaluator for a subject throughout the study to obtain consistency in grading 
scores and measuremen ts.   
Efficacy assessments will be conducted using IGA for overall disease severity  and inflammatory 
and non-inflammatory  lesion counts  on the face . The IGA should always be done prior to lesion 
counts.  
 
7.5.1 Investigator’s  Global Assessment ( IGA) of the Face  
The IGA scale to be used in the study is a measure of static evaluation of qualitative overall 
acne severity. IGA is an ordinal scale with five severity grades (rep orted only in integers, e.g., 
0 to 4). Each grade is defined by a distinct and clinically re levant morphologic description to 
minimize inter -observer variability  (  
 
 
 
 
 
Version 6.0 (Amendment 05) 
DFD -03 Lotion  
Protocol DFD -03-CD-006 
Page 29 of 62 
Table  4). The grades on the scale have been sufficiently defined to appropriate ly and 
unambiguously represent each severit y grade on the scale. The investigator is required to 
perform IGA scoring at each visit.  The IGA should always be done prior to lesion counts.

Table  4: IGA Scale f or Facial Acne Vulgaris*  
Grade  Description  
0 Clear skin with no inflammatory or non -inflammatory lesions  
1 Almost clear; rare non -inflammatory lesions with no more than rare 
papules  
2 Mild severity;  some non -inflammatory lesions with no more than a few 
inflammatory lesions (papules/pustules only, no nodular lesions)  
3 Moderate severity;  up to many non -inflammatory lesions and may have 
some inflammatory lesions, but no more than one small nodular lesion  
4 Severe;  up to many non -inflammatory and inflammatory lesion s, but no 
more than a few nodular lesions  
 * Areas  other  than the face and nose  are not included  in assessment 
 
Enrollment of subjects with mild  acne (IGA Grade 2) at each site will be restricted to no more 
than 20% of total enrollment at that site; management of this requirement will be handled by the 
IWRS.  
 
7.5.2 Lesion Counts  of the Face  
Non-inflammatory  lesions (closed comedones and open comedones), inflammatory lesions 
(papules and pustules), and nodulocystic lesions  (nodules and cysts)  on the face  (above the 
mandibular line),  including the nose, will be counted and recorded separately at each visit from 
Screening/ Baseline through Week 12. Non-inflammatory  lesions of acne are the open 
(blackheads) or closed (whiteheads) comedones. Closed comedones may b e more difficult to 
detect visually and may require stretching of the skin to aid in visualization. Inflammatory 
lesions are divided into papules, pustules, and nodules/nodulocystic lesions, depending on the 
severity and location of the inflammation within  the dermis. Nodulocystic lesions will be 
counted separately from inflammatory lesions of papules and pustules. The papules and pustules 
have surrounding halos of erythema allowing for their characterization as inflammatory. 
Nodules are typically erythemat ous and often tender and/or painful. Additionally, they are deep -
seated in the skin (i.e., centered in the dermis or subcutis). Nodules have been defined as being 
greater than 5  mm in diameter. The borders of these lesions may be difficult to determine 
because of the associated erythema/inflammation. The investigator/evaluator should use 
standard, good lighting to visualize lesions and a systematic counting procedure to ensure 
consistent and accurate counts.  
 
7.5.3 Subject’s Global Assessment  (SGA) of the Face  
The SGA of the facial skin will be conducted by the subjects at Baseline, Weeks 4, 8 , and 12 
using a standardized scale shown in the table below:

0 My face is basically  free of acne, with only an occasional blackhead 
and/or whitehead  
1 My face has several blackheads and/or whiteheads and small pimples, but 
there are no tender deep -seated bumps or cysts  
2 My face has several to many blackheads and/or whiteheads and small to 
medium -sized pimples, and may have one deep -seated bump or cyst  
3 My face has many blackheads and/or whiteheads, many medium - to large -
sized pimples, and perhaps a few deep -seated bumps or cysts  
4 My face has blackheads and/or whiteheads, and several to many medium - 
to large -sized pimples, and deep -seated bumps or cysts dominate  
* Areas  other  than the face and nose  are not included  in assessment 
 
7.5.4 Lesion Counts of the Chest and /or Back  (including shoulders)  
Non-inflammatory  lesions (closed comedones and open comedones), inflammatory lesions 
(papules and pustules), and nodulocystic lesions (nodules and cysts) on the chest and /or back  
including shoulders  (if applicable) will be counted and recorded separately at each visit from 
Baseline through  Week 12.  Nodulocystic lesions will be counted separately from inflammatory 
lesions of papules and pustules.  The back  area is from most prominent cervical spinous process  
superiorly  to the superior aspect of iliac crest  inferiorly  and the shoulder area wi ll also be 
included . The chest  area is from the manubrium of the sternum superiorly to the xiph iod process  
inferiorly . The lesion types are as described above. The investigator/evaluator should use 
standard, good lighting to visualize lesions and a systema tic counting procedure to ensure 
consistent and accurate counts.  
 
7.5.5 DLQI  
The DLQI is a quality of life instrument that has ten questions addressing symptoms and 
feelings (Questions 1 and 2), daily activities (Questions 3 and 4), leisure (Questions 5 and 6), 
work and school (Question 7), personal relationships (Questions 8 and 9) , and treatment 
(Question 10). Each is rated from 0 to 3, such  that the maximum score is 30. The higher the 
score, the mor e quality of life is impaired. The usual clinical interpretati on of the total score is 
as follows:  
 
0 to 1 = no effect at all on subject’s life  
2 to 5 = small effect on subject’s life  
6 to 10 = moderate effect on subject’s life  
11 to 20 = very large effect on subject’s life  
21 to 3 0 = extremely large effect on subjec t’s life  
 
The adult and children’s versions of the DLQI are provided in Appendix  2 and Appendix  3, 
respectively .

7.5.6 Cardiff Acne Disability Index  (CADI)  
The CADI is a short 5 item  questionnaire  that will be conducted by all subjects at Baseline, 
Week 4, 8, and 12 . The questionnaire rapidly assesses the disability caused by the acne. It 
consist s of 5 questions. The scoring for each question is done from 0 to 3  (a=3, b=2, c=1, d=0) . 
The CADI score is calculated by summing the score of each question resulting in a possible 
maximum of 15 and a minimum of 0. The higher the score, the more the quality of life is 
impaired.    
 
The CADI questionnaire is provided in Appendix 4 . 
7.6 Safety Assessments  
Safety assessments include vital signs, local cutaneous tolerance  evaluation of the treated skin,  
and AEs . Vital signs (blood pressure  and pulse) will be collected at each visit. A physical 
examination will be performed at Baseline (Day 1). Urine pregnancy tests for all female subjects 
(regardless of childbearing potential)  will be conducted at Screening and Baseline  (Day  1) and 
at each subsequent visit. Adverse events will be collected by spontaneous reports from subjects 
(either verbal or re corded in the subject diary ), by directed questioning of subjects , and by 
observation (see Section  8 for details about AEs).  Adverse events, whether believed by the 
investigator to be  related or unrelated to treatment, will be recorded on the eCRF . 
At Visits 2 through 5 the investigator will assess local cutaneous tolerance  by examining treated 
areas  for clinically significant non-lesional erythema, peeling , and dryness  that will be graded as 
shown below (Table  6, Table  7, Table  8) and recorded on the eCRF . Assessments will be 
recorded separately for the face and (if applicable) chest and /or back  (including shoulders) . The 
investigator will also ask the subject if any stinging ( Table  9), burning ( Table  10), or itching  
(Table  11) has occurred on the face  (chest and /or back  (including shoulde rs), if applicable  since 
the last visit  (for Visit 2 in the last 2 weeks ). Visit 2 assessments are made prior to first 
application . An AE should  be recorded  if the severity is worse  than at Baseline . In addition , 
overall cutaneous tolerance should be graded at the Week 12 visit, or the last visit if earlier, 
using the grading shown in Table  12. The local cutane ous tolerance signs and symptoms will be 
assessed separately for the face and chest and/or back (including shoulders)  using the same 
scales below.

7.7 Early Withdrawal of Subjects  
1. Subjects should be withdrawn from the study if they no longer wish to participate, are being 
uncooperative, or if the investigator feels that it is in the best interest of the su bject to 
withdraw.  
2. Subjects with protocol deviations  or for whom it is discovered should have been e xcluded 
should not be withdrawn unless there is a safety concern.  The protocol deviatio n should be 
recorded in the subject’s chart  and Protocol Deviation F orm and include d in the study report.   
3. Subjects who experience an AE resulting in or requiring discontinuation of study product  
use should be encouraged to be followed  in the study until the AE is resolved  or stabilized .   
4. Subjects whose treatment  randomiz ation is unblinded  at the study site should be withdrawn . 
5. If a female subject becomes pregnant during the study, study product  will be discontinued 
immediately and she will be followed through the pregnancy and delivery. Details of the 
pregnancy, delivery and health of the infant should be recorded on the Pregnancy Report  
Form and the sponsor notified  immediately . 
6. At the time of study discontinuation, the investigator will record the reason for early 
withdrawal, date of last study product  application , date of last visit or contact , collect AE 
data, and, if possible, perform all Week 12  visit-specific evaluations. Every attempt should 
be made to contact subjects who are lost -to-follow -up for a final safety assessment.  At least 
three attempts  must be documented in the subject’s chart including the use of at least 
1 certified letter. Any contact, either direct or indirect, should be made with the purpose to 
document the final status of the subject with regard to safety.

7.8 Modification of Protocol  
No amendments to this protocol can be made without consultation with and agreement of the 
sponsor, the FDA, and IRB. Amendments must be made in writing. Modifications needed for 
the safety of subjects w ill be made immediately with notifications made as soon as possible.  
 
7.9 Early Termination of Study  
If it is determined by the sponsor or investigators that the study presents an unreasonable and 
significant risk to subjects, the study will be terminated as s oon as possible, and in no event later 
than 5 working days following the determination that the study should be discontinued. The IRB 
and FDA must be notified as soon as possible about early termination of the study due to safety 
concerns.  
 
7.10  Study Schedule  
A Study Schedule chart can be found as Table  1. There are  approximately  5 study visits : 
Screening (Visit 1), Baseline (Vis it 2, Day  1), Week 4  (Visit 3), Week 8 (Visit 4), and Week 12  
(Visit 5). The visit window is ±  3 days for Week 4 and ±  5 days for Weeks 8 and 12. Visit 1 and 
Visit 2 should not be separated by more than 60 days.  
The Screening Visit (Visit 1) and the Baseline Visit (Visit 2) m ay be combined  into a single 
visit if no wash out is required. In that case, complete the required procedures for each visit as 
listed below . 
 
7.10.1  Visit 1 - Screening  Visit  
1. Obtain written  assent and/or  informed consent prior to initiating any study procedure s. 
Provide subject with signed copy of  ‘information and assent ’/consent form . Document 
assent and/or informed consent in the subject’s study record.  
2. List subject on Screening/Enrollment Log  and obtain subject number  via IWRS . Subject 
numbers consist of the 3 -digit site number followed by sequential 3 -digit numbers usua lly 
starting with 001 (e.g. , 206001, 206002, 206 003). All subjects including screen failures will 
also be assigned a subject number.   
3.  Perform a urine pregnancy test on all female subjects.  
4. Colle ct demographic data – date of birth , sex, race , and ethnicity.  
5. Review and record medical history , acne history  (including naïve vs previous therapy, acne 
treatment received 12 months prior to screening, onset date for acne and first acne treatment, 
previou s use of Tazorac and any issue with Tazorac use) , and concomitant medications , 
therapies , and procedures . Medical history and acne history shou ld be collected for the prior 
1-year period and concomitant medications , therapies , and procedures  collected from  the 
prior 6 -month period.  Only ongoing medical history items and ongoing concomitant 
medications should be entered on the eCRF . Acne history will be collected and recorded in 
the eCRF.

8 ADVERSE  EVENTS  
Adverse events will be collected by spontaneous reports from subjects, either verbal or recorded 
in the subject diary, by directed questioning of s ubjects, and by observation.   
The most common frequently reported adverse reactions during clinical trials with tazarotene 
cream 0.1% for the treatment of acne were desquamation, dry skin, erythem a, and burning 
 
 
 
 
 
Version 6.0 (Amendment 05) 
DFD -03 Lotion  
Protocol DFD -03-CD-006 
Page 41 of 62 
sensation , occurring in 10 % to 30% of subjects. Adverse reactions occurring in 1% to 5% of 
treated subject s included pruritus, irritation, face pain, and stinging .  
The investigator is to pay special attention at each visit to any signs  of clinically significant 
dryness, non -lesional er ythema , and peeling and report  as an AE subsequent to the Baseline 
Visit  if worse than at Baseline . 
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject participating in a clinical trial. The 
event does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship w ith the study product . An AE can 
therefore be any sign, symptom, or disease, or any worsening of an existing sign, symptom, or 
disease, whether or not considered related to the study product  or trial procedures, including 
injuries.   
Any medical condition that is present at the time of Screening or Baseline should be considered 
as medical history and reported on the medical history eCRF  and should not be reported as an 
AE except for AEs observed at the Baseline V isit due to study procedures performed at the  
Screening visit , which should be reported. Anticipated day -to-day fluctuations of pre -existing 
conditions should not be reported as AEs. Unexpected worsening of pre -existing conditions 
should be reported as AEs. The disease or condition being studied or e xpected progression, 
signs, or symptoms of the disease or condition being studied such as worsening of acne should 
not be reported as an AE unless it is more severe than expected , results in discontinuation from 
the study or requires alternat ive therapy . 
All serious adverse events  (SAEs) , all study product -related events , and all AEs leading to study 
product  discontinuation must be followed until the clinical outcome is determined or until all 
attempts to determine resolution of the event are exhausted  (not recovered  is not an acceptable 
outcome  for acute conditions ). For other AEs, the status at the last visit can be entered into the 
eCRF . 
 
8.1 Adverse Event Reporting Period  
Adverse event data must be collected from the time treatment is initiated until study product  
treatment is discontinued except for spontaneously reported SAEs,  which  should be reported up 
to 30 days after discontinuing study product use  and entered in to the eCRF . Adverse events 
occurring from the time of the Screening Visit until the Baseli ne Visit associated with study 
procedures should also be reported  for all subjects , including screen failures . 
 
8.2 Recording Adverse Events  
The investigator will record all AEs, regardless of relationship to study product  on the AE 
eCRF . Standard medical terminology should be used when describing AEs. Whenever possible 
a diagnosis should be made and recorded on the eCRF  rather than listing signs and symptoms. 
Intermittent AEs can be recorded once. The anatomical location of the AE must be specified 
when  applicable. The following information should be recorded on the eCRF : 
 
1. Description , including whether on treated area or not  
2. Start  date 
 
 
 
 
 
Version 6.0 (Amendment 05) 
DFD -03 Lotion  
Protocol DFD -03-CD-006 
Page 42 of 62 
3. Stop date or date of death , ongoing , or unknown  
4. Severity of the event (see Section  8.3.1  Severity  for details)  
5. Study product  use continued or not  
6. Outcome of the event ( recovered/ resolved, recovered/ resolv ed with sequelae,  not 
recovered/not resolved , unknown, fatal) 
7. Relationship to study product  (see Section  8.3.2  Relationship to Study Product 
[Causality ] for details)  
8. Indication of whether the event is serious (see Section  8.3.3  Seriousness for details)  
9. Actions taken including treatment with concomitant medication  
Vital Signs Varia bles 
Vital signs  (except at Visits 1 & 2)  should be reported as AEs if they are  out of range and  
considered to be clinically significant, as per the Investigator’s judgment.  
 
8.3 Assessment of Adverse Events  
8.3.1 Severity  
It is the investigator's responsibility to  assess the severity of each AE. Descriptions of severity 
are as follows:  
 
1. Mild :  Awareness of sign or symptom, but easily tolerated. Not likely to interfere with 
normal activity or require medical attention.  
2. Moderate :  Discomfort enough to cause interference with usual activity. May require 
medical intervention.  
3. Severe :  Incapacitating such that  normal activity is prevented. Likely requires medical 
intervention and/or close follow -up. 
 
8.3.2 Relationship to Study Product  (Causality)  
It is the investigat or’s responsibility to assess the relationship between the study product  and the 
AE. The degree of “relatedness” of the AE to the study product  should  be described using the 
following categories:  
 
1. Not Related : The event is clearly due to extraneous causes (e.g., diseases, environment, 
etc.). Specify if known . Or, the event is most probably  produced by other factors such as 
the subject ’s clinical state, therapeutic interv entions , or concomitant therapy and does  
not follow a known response pattern to the study product . 
2. Possibly Related : The event is temporally related to study product  use but can be 
explained by another etiology. Information on the effect of study product  withdrawal 
may be lacking.  
3. Probably Related : The event is temporally related to study product  use and is consistent 
with known effects of the study product  and/or improves upon withdrawal of the study 
product .  
 
 
 
 
 
Version 6.0 (Amendment 05) 
DFD -03 Lotion  
Protocol DFD -03-CD-006 
Page 43 of 62 
4. Definitely Related : The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the tim e of 
study product  administration and/or follows a known response pattern to the study  
product, and could not have been produced by other factors such as the subject ’s clinical 
state, therapeutic intervention , or concomitant therapy, and either oc curs imme diately 
following study  product administration or improves on stopping the product, or there is a 
positive reaction at the application site.  
 
8.3.3 Seriousness  
It is the investigator’s responsibility to determine the “seriousness” of an AE. A serious adverse 
event (SAE) is any AE occurring at any dose that results in any of the following outcomes:  
 
1. Death  
2. Life-threatening (subject at immediate risk of death)  
3. Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization  
4. Results in persistent or significant disabilit y/incapacity  
5. Results in congenital anomaly/birth defect  
 
Important medical events that may not result in death, are not life -threatening, or do not require 
hospitalization may be considered an SAE when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, 
they may jeo pardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one  
of the outcomes listed above. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm 
requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions 
that do not result in inpatient hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency or drug 
abuse.  
 
8.4 Reporting Serious Adverse Events  
SAE  informati on must be faxed or emailed  within 24 hours of becoming aware of the event. The 
minimum initial information required to be reported on the Serious Adverse Event Form is: the 
subject number, subject initials, the event, the causality, the date of the event , and the name of 
the person reporting the event. This initial report should be promptly followed up with a 
completed  Serious Adverse Event Form.

 Associate Director  
 Clinical Pharmacovigilance, NA  
 Fax:  908-450-1510  
 Email:  SAE@drreddys.com  
 
The initial information must include a causality assessment that is provided by the primary 
investigator or other medically qualified individual. The causality assessment can be amended 
as more information is available . Significant new information about  ongoing SAEs s hould be 
reported promptly to the s ponsor.  
 
 
 
 
 
Version 6.0 (Amendment 05) 
DFD -03 Lotion  
Protocol DFD -03-CD-006 
Page 44 of 62 
Serious adverse events will be evaluated by the medical monitor within 24 hours of receipt and 
plans for management and further reporting (i.e. , FDA) determined.  
It is the responsibility of the CRO, Symbio LLC,  to promptly notify the IRB and other 
Investigators involved in this study about serious and unexpected SAEs for which there is a 
reasonable possibility of their being related to the investigational product.  
Follow -up of Serious Adverse Events  
All follow -up reports will be subject to the same reporting timelines as the Initial  Reports. 
Within 24 hours of receipt of new information, the updated follow -up SAE  form, along with any 
supporting documentation (e.g., patient discharge summary or  autopsy reports), sh ould be faxed 
or emailed to the Sponsor.  
 
8.5 Discontinuation Due to an Adverse Event  
The sponsor  must be notified within 5 days if any subject is withdrawn or discontinues study 
product  use due to an AE if the event  is related to the study product  (see title page for contact 
information).   
 
8.6 Exposure in utero  (Pregnancy)  
If a female subject becomes pregnant during the study, study product  must  be discontinued 
immediately and she must  be followed through the pregnancy and delivery . The investigator 
should repor t the event to the sponsor immediately (see contact information on title page) and 
complete the Pregnancy Report  Form.  The expected date of delivery or expected date of the end 
of the pregnancy should be included in this information. The investigator is instructed to contact 
the subject every 3 months until the end of her pregnancy and repo rt the outcome to the sponsor. 
Details of the pregnancy, delivery and health of the infant should be recorded on the Pregnancy 
Report  Form.  
The following outcomes of p regnancy fall under the criteria for SAEs  and should be reported as 
such: delivery complications prolonging hospitalization, spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, death 
of newborn baby, congenital anomaly, and anomaly in a miscarried fetus.  
 
9 DATA HANDLING  AND  RECORD KEEPING  
9.1 Confidentiality  
Information about study subjects will be kept confidential and managed according to the 
requirements of the Health Insurance Porta bility and Accountability Act. This regulation 
requires a signed authorization informing the s ubject of the following:  
 What protected health information (PHI) will be collected from subjects in this study  
 Who will have access to that information and why  
 Who will use or disclose that information  
 The rights of a research subject to revoke their authorization for use/disclosure of their 
PHI.  
 
 
 
 
 
Version 6.0 (Amendment 05) 
DFD -03 Lotion  
Protocol DFD -03-CD-006 
Page 45 of 62 
 Expiration of authorization  
If a subject revokes authorization to collect and use PHI, the investigator, by regulation, retains 
the ability to use all informat ion collected prior to th e revocation of authorization. For subjects 
who have revoked authorization to collect and use PHI, attempts should be made to obtain 
permission to collect at least vital status (i.e. , that the subject is alive) at the end of their 
scheduled study period.  
 
9.2 Source Documents  
Investigators must keep accurate separate records (other than eCRF s) of all subject visits that 
include all pertinent study -related information , including original signed /dated informed 
consent/  information and assent forms. Source documents for this study include all w ritten 
records of study data. All study data must have a paper source document , including investigator 
assessments.   
 
9.3 Screening/Enrollment Log  
A subject Screening/Enrollment Log, noting reasons fo r screen failure where applicable, must 
be maintained for all subjects who are consented. The log should also include subject initials, 
screening date, subject number , and date of enrollment , which is when ICF is signed , where 
applicable.   
 
9.4 Case Report Fo rms 
Database set -up will be performed by Symbio in collaboration with the electronic data capture 
(EDC) vendor, using an appropriate fully validated, 21 CFR Part 11 compliant EDC system. 
eCRF s will be provided to each site via a secured web link. All appli cable study data collected 
on each subject will be recorded by approved site personnel into the eCRF . Only authorized site 
personnel will be able to enter/modify/correct data to the eCRF . 
Approved staff at Symbio will verify all data entered into eCRF s for completeness and accuracy 
with reference to the source documents and records and will issue manual data queries to correct 
missing data or discrepancies found against the source within the EDC system.  
Data validation will consist of automated and manual e dit checks that are created directly into 
the EDC. Automated edit checks will be executed on all data points defined and documented by 
the study team and data management. Study metrics will be reported from the EDC system.  
After all data have been verified  by approved staff at Symbio, an investigator or sub-investigator 
(listed on Form FDA 1572) is required to review and approve all eCRF s prior to database lock 
and breaking of the blind.  
 
After database lock, each site will receive the eCRF  data for their site in an electronic format  for 
local archival purposes.  
 
 
 
 
 
Version 6.0 (Amendment 05) 
DFD -03 Lotion  
Protocol DFD -03-CD-006 
Page 46 of 62 
Quality assurance verification via a 10% database audit of eCRF  data will be conducted before 
database lock and before the treatment assignment code is broken.  
 
9.5 Archiving of Study Documentation  
The investigator must retain study records for 2 years following the date a marketing application 
is approved for the investigational product; or, if the application is not filed or is not approved, 
until 2 years after the investigation is discontinued and the  FDA is notified.  
The sponsor will inform the investigator, in writing, as to when these documents no longer need 
to be maintained.  
All study documents, original source documents, correspondence, IRB documents, etc. are 
subject to sponsor and FDA inspectio n at any time.  
 
10 MONITORING  AND DATA QUALITY ASS URANCE  
Only persons who are appropriately trained and who have the scientific and clinical knowledge 
to adequately monitor the study will be selec ted for monitoring this study. The monitor must 
have at least 1 year of previous experience i n monitoring clinical studies. The monitor should be 
familiar with the etiology and signs and symptoms of acne and the treatment options that are 
currently available.   
Before study initiation, the investigator and site perso nnel will receive protocol training from 
the sponsor’s representatives to ensure collection of accurate, consistent, complete , and reliable 
data. This training will take place either at a web -based Investig ator Meeting or individually 
on-site. 
During the c ourse of the study, a monitor will make multiple site visits to check the progress of 
the study, review consent forms, review protocol compliance, assess drug accountability, and 
ensure that the study is being conducted according to the protocol and GCP. Any review of the 
subjects’ original medical records will be performed in a manner to ensure that subject 
confidentiality is maintained. The investigator will ensure that the monitor or other compliance 
auditor is given access to all study -related documents  and has adequate time and space to 
conduct the monitoring visit including availability of the investigator and site personnel to 
discuss findings.  
Data capture methods will be designed to ensure accurate transfer of data to electronic media.  
The sponsor’ s Quality Assurance representative may conduct QA audits randomly or if needed 
at 5% to 10% of the investigator sites.  
 
11 STATISTICAL  CONSIDERATIONS  
All statistical processing will be performed using SAS® unless otherwise stated. Two -sided 
hypothesis testing  will be conducted for all inferential analyses using a significance level of 
0.05. Efficacy analyses performed using the intent -to-treat (ITT) population will be considered

primary. Efficacy analyses performed using the per -protocol (PP) population will be considered 
supportive. Safety analyses will be performed on the safety population  (all subjects  who receive 
study product  and provide any post-baseline safety information ). Study populations are defined 
in Section  11.2. 
A Statistical Analysis Plan, describing all statistical analyses, will be provided as a separate 
document prior to database lock and unblinding of the study treatments.  
 
11.1 Sample Size  
The sample siz e was estimated based on the primary study endpoints and statistics available 
from the Summary Basis of Approval for Tazorac® (tazarotene) Gel (NDA 20 -600). The total 
sample size of 550 will provide an overall power of at least  90% based on a 2 -tailed alpha of 
0.05. 
Approximat ely 550 subjects (275 for each treatment arm) will be randomized  and about 25 to 35  
sites will participate in the study .

11.2  Analysis  Data Sets  
11.2.1  Intent -to-Treat  
The ITT population will be the primary efficacy analysis data set and consists of all subjects 
who are randomized  and dispensed study medication.  
 
11.2.2  Per-Protocol  
The PP population will include all subjects in the ITT population who complete the Week  12 
evaluation without any major protocol violations (i.e., any subject or investigator activity that 
 
 
 
 
 
Version 6.0 (Amendment 05) 
DFD -03 Lotion  
Protocol DFD -03-CD-006 
Page 48 of 62 
could have possibly interfered with the therapeutic administration of the treatment or the precise 
evaluation of treatmen t efficacy).  
Specifically, the PP population will include subjects in the ITT population who meet all of the 
following criteria:  
1. Subject met all inclusion/exclusion criteria . 
2. Subject did not take any prohibited concomitant medications during the evaluatio n 
period. The concomitant medication usage will be reviewed during the population 
determination review, remaining blinded to treatment designation, to determine 
prohibited medication usage that warrants exclusion from the PP population  if they 
met the entr ance criteria without any protocol violations . This review will take into 
consideration the timing, duration of treatment with the concomitant medication, and 
influence on the efficacy and safety assessments prior to deeming a prohibited 
concomitant medica tion as a protocol violation that warrants exclusion from PP.  
3. Completed the Week 12  visit within the allowed  window . 
4. Subject was compliant with the dosing regimen. A subject will be considered 
compliant if the subject applied at least 80% but no more than 120% of the expected 
applications (168 applications expected) during the entire  evaluation  period .  
Subjects who prematurely discontinue from the study due to documented lack of efficacy, 
worsening condition, or a treatment -related  AE will be included in the PP population.   
 
Other additional criteria may be added to the list to accommodate for unforeseen events that 
occurred during the conduct of the trial that result in noteworthy study protocol violations. 
These criteria will be documented with appropriate signature at the time subject populations are 
finalized, prior to database lock.  
 
11.2.3  Safety Population  
All subject s who receive at least one confirmed dose of study product  and provide any post -
baseline safety information  will be incl uded in the safety population. No imputation will be 
made for missing safety data.  
 
11.3 Demographic and Baseline Data  
Subject demographic an d baseline characteristics will be summarized descriptively by treatment 
group for the ITT, Safety, and PP populations.  
 
11.4 Efficacy Analyses   
Efficacy summaries will be provided for both  the ITT and PP population s. 
 
11.4.1  Primary Efficacy Analysis  
The three co-primary efficacy endpoints will be analyzed as follows on the ITT population:  
 
 
 
 
 
Version 6.0 (Amendment 05) 
DFD -03 Lotion  
Protocol DFD -03-CD-006 
Page 49 of 62 
 IGA success at Week 12 ( an IGA score of 0 (Clear)  or 1 (almost clear)  with at least a 2 -
grade reduction from baseline) – will be  analyzed using the Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel 
(CMH) test for general association with treatment, stratified by site/analysis center and 
baseline IGA.   Homogeneity of treatment effect across sites / analysis centers will be 
assessed at the 0.15 significance level using the Breslow -Day test.  
 Change in infl ammatory lesion counts on the face from baseline to Week 12 – will be 
analyzed using a two -way analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with factors of 
treatment group, site/analysis center, treatment*center interaction, baseline IGA and a 
covariate of baseli ne inflammatory lesion count . 
 Change in non -inflammatory lesion counts on the face from baseline to Week 12 – will 
be analyzed using the same ANCOVA model as for the inflammatory lesion counts 
(with covariate of baseline non -inflammatory lesion count instead of inflammatory) . 
 
In the above analyses, any significant Breslow -Day or treatment*center interactions (P<0.15) 
will be examined, and if outlier centers are identified, the analysis may be repeated, excluding 
those centers.  
To claim success of the study, the analysis of all three co -primary endpoints must show DFD -03 
Lotion significantly superior to the vehicle lotion (at the 5% level, 2 -sided).  No multiplicity 
adjustments will be applied . . 
 
11.4.2  Primary Sensitivity Analysis  
 
To assess the sensitivity of the above primary method s to missing  data, analysis will also be 
conducted for the ITT population with missing values being imputed by the following two 
methods:  
1) The last -observation -carried -forward (LOCF) approach : Where a co -primary endpoint (IGA, 
inflammatory and non -inflammatory lesion counts)  has missing Week 12 value, the most 
recent value available for that endpoint will be imputed in its place . 
2) Multiple imputation (MI) approach with the Markov Chain Monte Carlo  (MCMC) method:  
The variables to be imputed will be the three co -primary efficacy endpoints (IGA and the 
inflammatory and non -inflammatory lesion counts) at all visits .  The MI regression model 
(used to create the imputations) will include the following factors : treatment, age, gender, 
baseline inflammatory lesion counts, baseline non -inflammatory lesion counts, and the 
results of the same variable from previous visits .  A first -stage MI with MCMC will be 
performed using SAS PROC MI (seed=14805) to produce a single imputed dataset with a  
monotone missingness pattern.  Subsequently, a second -stage MI will be performed 
(seed=26174) using the logistic regression method to produce 5 imputed datasets with all 
visit values filled in.  The primary analysis described above will then be performed on each 
of the 5 imputed datasets (for each of the 3 primary endpoints), which will produce 
estimates of treatment difference (DFD -03 minus vehicle; in the case of IGA success, it will 
be the estimate of difference in logodds and will be back -transformed t o odds ratio and 
corresponding CI at the end) and the standard error of that estimate.  Finally, the set of 
 
 
 
 
 
Version 6.0 (Amendment 05) 
DFD -03 Lotion  
Protocol DFD -03-CD-006 
Page 50 of 62 
estimates and standard errors will be analyzed by PROC MIANALYZE to produce overall 
estimates, confidence intervals, and P -values for the treatment effect.  
 
11.4.3  Secondary Efficacy Analysis  
The secondary endpoints  are: 
 
1. Percent change from Baseline to Week 12 in inflammatory lesion counts on the 
face.  
2. Percent change from Baseline to Week 12 in non -inflammatory lesion counts on 
the face  
The s econdary endpoint s will be analyzed as follows :  
The percent change from Baseline to Week 12 in inflammatory  and non -inflammatory lesion  
count s on the face will be analyzed using a two -way analysis of covariance ( ANCOVA ) model 
with factors of treatment group site/analysis center , and baseline IGA  and a covariate of baseline 
lesion count . 
To control for overall Type I error rate  for testing multiple secondary endpoints , statistical 
analysis for the secondary endpoints will be performed if p<0.05 has been achieved fo r all the 
co-primary endpoints, us ing a sequential  approach according to the following  order: percent 
change in inflammatory lesion counts  on the face, and  then percent change in non-inflammatory 
lesion counts  on the face . In detail, if p<0.05 is achieved for a higher ranking secondary 
variable, then success will be declared for the variable, and statistical comparisons will be 
performed for the lower ranking variable. If p<0.05 is not achieved for a higher ranking 
variable, then statistical comparisons wil l be considered descriptive (non -inferential) for this 
variable and for the lower ranking secondary variable.  
 
11.4.4  Other Efficacy Analyses  
Descriptive statistics will be presented for the ITT population for the following efficacy 
endpoints  
 
1) Time to 50% reduct ion in total lesion counts on the face.  
 
2) Absolute change from Baseline in inflammatory, non -inflammatory and total lesion 
counts on the face at Weeks 4 and 8 . 
3) Percent change from Baseline in inflammatory, non -inflammatory, and total lesion 
counts on the fa ce at Weeks 4 and 8.  
4) Proportion of subjects with an IGA score of 0 or 1 with at least a 2 -grade reduction (for 
the face) from Baseline at Weeks 4 and 8 . 
5) Change from Baseline in Children’s DLQI total score in subjects 16  years of age or 
younger at Weeks 4 , 8, and 12. 
6) Change from Baseline in DLQI score in subjects >16 years of age at Weeks 4, 8 and 12.  
7) Percent change from Baseline in inflammatory, non -inflammatory and total lesion counts 
on the chest and /or back including shoulders (in relevant subjects ) at W eeks 4, 8, and 12.  
 
 
 
 
 
Version 6.0 (Amendment 05) 
DFD -03 Lotion  
Protocol DFD -03-CD-006 
Page 51 of 62 
8) Time to 50% reduction in total lesion counts on the chest and /or back  (including 
shoulders ). 
9) Proportion of subjects with at least a 2 -grade improvement from Baseline in the SGA  at 
Week 12.   
10) Change from Baseline in CADI score at Weeks 4 , 8 and 12. 
 
Sample size, frequency counts and percentages will be used to summarize categorical endpoints. 
Sample size, mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum will be used to 
summarize continuous endpoints.  Sample size, median, and frequenc y and percent of censored 
subjects will be used to summarize time -to-event variables.  
 
11.4.5  Secondary Sensitivity Analyses  
To assess the potential impact of protocol violations, analysis of the primary and secondary 
efficacy endpoints described above will be re peated on  the PP population.  
 
For the PP population, number of subjects who are  discontinued prematurely due to documented 
lack of efficacy, worsening condition, or a treatment -related AE is expected to be small. For 
these subjects the efficacy data from t heir termination visit will be assigned to the nearest 
corresponding scheduled visit that has been missed, and  carried forward to the sub sequent visits 
for the analysis . 
 
11.4.6  Pooling Analyses  
For the purpose of analysis, a small site is defined as a site with < 4 ITT subjects in either 
treatment  arm. Small sites will be ranked in descending order based on the total number of ITT 
subjects of the sites. The first small site will be pooled with the next small site, or with more 
sites if needed, until the pooled site/analysis center has at least 4 ITT subjects in both the  arms. 
The algorithm will continue down the list, and  if the last few small sites are pooled but fail to be 
adequately large, they will be combined with the previously pooled smallest site/analysi s center.  
 
11.5 Safety Analyses  
11.5.1  Extent of Exposure  
The extent of exposure to study product  on the face in each treatment group will be summarized 
as the total number of applications and number and percentage of subjects who are compliant  
for the Baseline to Week 12 evaluation period . A subject will be considered compliant with the 
dosing regimen if the subject has applied at least 80% but no more than 120% of the expected  
applications for the respective evaluation period . The total number of applications will be  taken 
from the subject diaries . The number and percentage of subjects who use study product for less 
than 28 days, 28 to 56 days, 57 to 84 days and more than 84 days will be summarized.  
 
11.5.2  Local Cutaneous Safety Evaluation  
Non-lesional  erythema, peeling, dryness, burning, stinging, and itching scores  will be 
summarized by treatment group and visit including sample size, frequency count and percentage  
 
 
 
 
 
Version 6.0 (Amendment 05) 
DFD -03 Lotion  
Protocol DFD -03-CD-006 
Page 52 of 62 
for each visit . A similar summary will be provided excluding subjects with signs or sym ptoms 
present at Baseline.  
 
11.5.3  Adverse Events  
All AEs occurring during the study will be recorded and classified on the basis of Medical 
Dictionary for Regulatory Activities ( MedDRA ) terminology. Treatment -emergent adverse 
events (TEAEs) are AEs with an onset  on or after the date of the first study product  
administration. For the safety population, all reported TEAEs  will be summarized by treatment 
group, the number and percent of subjects reporting events, system organ class  (SOC) , preferred 
term (PT), severi ty, relationship to study product , and seriousness. When summarizing TEAEs 
by causality and severity, each subject will be counted only once within a system organ class or 
a preferred term by using the event with the greatest relationship and highest sever ity within 
each classification.  
Additionally, treatment -related TEAEs will be summarized for each treatment group by SOC 
and PT, and further by severity . A TEA E will be considered treatment -related if it is reported as 
possibly, probably, or definitely related to study treatment .  
SAEs will be listed by subject. In addition, a list of subjects who prematurely discontinued from 
the study due to an AE will be provided.  
All information pertaining to AEs noted during the study will be listed by subject, deta iling 
verbatim term given by the i nvestigator, preferred term, system organ class, onset date, 
resolution date, maximum severity, seriousness, action taken regarding study product , corrective 
treatment, outcome, and drug relatedness. The event onset will a lso be shown relative (in 
number of days) to date of first administration.  
AEs related to study procedures done before study product  administration will be provided in a 
data listing.  
 
11.5.4  Vital signs  
Changes from Baseline in vital signs (blood pressure  and pulse) will be summarized by 
treatment group at each evaluation visit using descriptive statistics.  
 
11.5.5  Safety Laboratory Values  
Urine pregnancy tests will be performed  at all visits,  and results will be provided in a data 
listing.

A. PREAMBLE   
1. The World Medical Association (WMA) has developed the Declaration of Helsinki as a statement of 
ethical principles for medical research involving human subjects, including research on identifiable 
human material and data.  
The Declaration is intended to be read as a whole and each of its constituent paragraphs should be 
applied with consideration of all other relevant paragraphs.  
2. Consistent with the mandate of the WMA, the Declaration is addressed primarily to physicians . The 
WMA encourages other s who are involved in medical research involving human subjects to adopt 
these principles.  
B. GENERAL PRINCIPLES  
3. The Declaration of Geneva of the WMA binds the physician with the words, “The health of my 
patient will be my first consid eration,” and the international Code o f Medical Ethics declares that “ A 
physician shall act in the patient’s best interest when providing medical care.”  
4. It is the duty of the physician to promote and safeguard the health , well -being and rights of patients,  
including those who are involved in medical research. The physician's knowledge and conscience are 
dedicated to the fulfillment of this duty.  
5. Medical progress is based on research that ultimately must include studies involving human subjects.   
6. The prima ry purpose of medical research involving human subjects is to understand the causes, 
development and effects of diseases and improve preventive, diagnostic and therapeutic interventions 
(methods, procedures and treatments). Even the best current interventi ons must be evaluated 
continually through research for their safety, effectiveness, efficiency, accessibility and quality.  
7. Medical research is subject to ethical standards that promote and ensure respect for all human subjects 
and protect their health and  rights.  
8. While the primary purpose of medical research is to generate new knowledge, this goal can never take 
precedence over the rights and interests of individual research subjects.  
9. It is the duty of physicians who are involved in medical research to protect the life, health, dignity, 
integrity, right to self -determination, privacy, and confidentiality of personal information of research 
subjects. The responsibility for the protection of research subjects must always rest with the physician 
or other he alth care professionals and never with the research subjects, even though they have given 
consent.   
10. Physicians must consider the ethical, legal and regulatory norms and standards for research involving 
human subjects in their own countries as well as appli cable international norms and standards. No 
national or international ethical, legal or regulatory requirement should reduce or eliminate any of the 
protections for research subjects set forth in this Declaration.  
 
 
 
 
 
Version 6.0 (Amendment 05) 
DFD -03 Lotion  
Protocol DFD -03-CD-006 
Page 55 of 62 
11. Medical research should be conducted in a manner that minimizes possible harm to the environment.  
12. Medical research involving human subjects must be conducted only by individuals with the 
appropriate ethics and scientific education, training and qualifications. Research on patients or healthy 
volun teers requires the supervision of a competent and appropriately qualified physician or other 
health care professional.  
13. Groups that are underrepresented in medical research should be provided appropriate access to 
participation in research.  
14. Physicians who combine medical research with medical care should involve their patients in research 
only to the extent that this is justified by its potential preventive, diagnostic or therapeutic value and if 
the physician has good reason to believe that participation i n the research study will not adversely 
affect the health of the patients who serve as research subjects.  
15. Appropriate compensation and treatment for subjects who are harmed as a result of participating in 
research must be ensured.  
C. RISK, BURDENS AND BENEFI TS 
16. In medical practice and in medical research, most interventions involve risks and burdens.  
Medical research involving human subjects may only be conducted if the importance of the objective 
outweighs the risks and burdens to the research subjects.  
17. All medical research involving human subjects must be preceded by careful assessment of predictable 
risks and burdens to the individuals and groups involved in the research in comparison with 
foreseeable benefits to them and to other individuals or groups affe cted by the condition under 
investigation.  
Measures to minimize the risks must be implemented. The risks must be continuously monitored, 
assessed and documented by the researcher.  
18. Physicians may not be involved in a research study involving human subjects unless they are 
confident that the risks have been adequately assessed and can be satisfactorily managed.  
When the risks are found to outweigh the potential benefits or when there is conclusive proof of 
definitive outcomes, physicians must assess whether t o continue, modify or immediately stop the 
study.  
D. VULNERABLE GROUPS AND INDIVIDUALS    
19. Some groups and individuals are particularly vulnerable and may have an increased likelihood of 
being wronged or of incurring additional harm.  
All vulnerable groups and individuals should receive specifically considered protection.  
20. Medical Research with a vulnerable group is only justified if the research is responsive to the health 
needs or priorities of this group and the research cannot be carried out in a non -vulnerab le group. In 
addition, this group should stand to benefit from the knowledge, practices or interventions that result 
from the research.  
E. SCIENTIFIC REQUIREMENTS AND RESEARCH PROTOCOLS  
21. Medical research involving human subjects must conform to generally accep ted scientific principles, 
be based on a thorough knowledge of the scientific literature, other relevant sources of information, 
and adequate laboratory and, as appropriate, animal experimentation. The welfare of animals used for 
research must be respected . 
22. The design and performance of each research study involving human subjects must be clearly 
described and justified in a research protocol. The protocol should contain a statement of the ethical 
considerations involved and should indicate how the principl es in this Declaration have been 
addressed. The protocol should include information regarding funding, sponsors, institutional 
affiliations, potential conflicts of interest, incentives for subjects and information regarding provisions 
for treating and/or c ompensating subjects who are harmed as a consequence of participation in the 
 
 
 
 
 
Version 6.0 (Amendment 05) 
DFD -03 Lotion  
Protocol DFD -03-CD-006 
Page 56 of 62 
research study. In clinical trials, the protocol must also describe appropriate arrangements for post -
trial provisions.   
F. RESEARCH ETHICS COMMITTEES  
23. The research protocol must be submitted for consideration, comment, guidance and approval to the 
concerned research  ethics committee before the study begins. This committee must be transparent in 
its functioning, must be independent of the researcher, the sponsor and any other undue in fluence  and 
must be duly qualified . It must take into consideration the laws and regulations of the country or 
countries in which the research is to be performed as well as applicable international norms and 
standards but these must not be allowed to reduc e or eliminate any of the protections for research 
subjects set forth in this Declaration. The committee must have the right to monitor ongoing studies. 
The researcher must provide monitoring information to the committee, especially information about 
any s erious adverse events. No amendment to the protocol may be made without consideration and 
approval by the committee.  After the end of the study, the researchers must submit a final report to the 
committee containing a summary of the study’s findings and co nclusions.  
G. PRIVACY AND CONFIDENTIALITY  
24. Every precaution must be taken to protect the privacy of research subjects and the confidentiality of 
their personal information.  
H. INFORMED CONSENT  
25. Participation by individuals capable of giving informed consent as su bjects in medical research must 
be voluntary. Although it may be appropriate to consult family members or community leaders, no 
individual capable of giving informed consent may be enrolled in a research study unless he or she 
freely agrees.  
26. In medical res earch involving human subjects capable of giving informed consent, each potential 
subject must be adequately informed of the aims, methods, sources of funding, any possible conflicts 
of interest, institutional affiliations of the researcher, the anticipate d benefits and potential risks of the 
study and the discomfort it may entail, post -study provisions and any other  relevant aspects of the 
study. The potential subject must be informed of the right to refuse to participate in the study or to 
withdraw conse nt to participate at any time without reprisal. Special attention should be given to the 
specific information needs of individual potential subjects as well as to the methods used to deliver 
the information. After ensuring that the potential subject has un derstood the information, the 
physician or another appropriately qualified individual must then seek the potential subject's freely -
given informed consent, preferably in writing. If the consent cannot be expressed in writing, the non -
written consent must b e formally documented and witnessed. All medical research subjects should be 
given the option of being informed about the general outcome and results of the study.  
27. When seeking informed consent for participation in a research study the physician should be 
particularly cautious if the potential subject is in a dependent relationship with the physician or may 
consent under duress. In such situations the informed consent sho uld be sought by an appropriately 
qualified individual who is completely independent of this relationship.  
28. For a potential research subject who is in capable of giving informed consent , the physician must seek 
informed consent from the legally authorized representative. These individuals must not be included 
in a research study that has no likelihood of benefit for them unless it is intended to promote the 
health of the  group represented by the potential subject, the research cannot instead be performed with 
persons  capable of providing informed consent, and the research entails only minimal risk and 
minimal burden.  
29. When a potential research subject who is deemed incapable of giving informed consent is able to give 
assent to decisions about participation i n research, the physician must seek that assent in addition to 
the consent of the legally authorized representative. The potential subject's dissent should be 
respected.  
30. Research involving subjects who are physically or mentally incapable of giving consen t, for example, 
unconscious patients, may be done only if the physical or mental condition that prevents giving 
 
 
 
 
 
Version 6.0 (Amendment 05) 
DFD -03 Lotion  
Protocol DFD -03-CD-006 
Page 57 of 62 
informed consent is a necessary characteristic of the research group . In such circumstances the 
physician must seek informed consent from the le gally authorized representative. If no such 
representative is available and if the research cannot be delayed, the study may proceed without 
informed consent provided that the specific reasons for involving subjects with a condition that 
renders them unabl e to give informed consent have been stated in the research protocol and the study 
has been approved by a research ethics committee. Consent to remain in the research should be 
obtained as soon as possible from the subject or a legally authorized represent ative.  
31. The physician must fully inform the patient which aspects of their care are related to the research. The 
refusal of a patient to participate in a study or the patient’s decision to withdraw from the study must 
never adversely affect the patient -physician relationship.  
32. For medical research using identifiable human material or data, such as research on material or data 
contained in biobanks or similar repositories, physicians must seek informed consent for its collection, 
storage and/or reuse. There m ay be exceptional situations where consent would be impossible or 
impracticable to obtain for such research. In such situations the research may be done only after 
consideration and approval of a research ethics committee.  
I. USE OF PLACEBO  
33. The benefits, risk s, burdens and effectiveness of a new intervention must be tested against those of the 
best proven intervention(s), except in the following circumstances:  
a. Where no proven intervention exists, the use of placebo, or no intervention, is acceptable; or  
b. Where for compelling and scientifically sound methodological reasons the use of any 
intervention less effective than the best proven one, the use of placebo, or no intervention is 
necessary to determine the efficacy or safety of an intervention and the patients who receive 
any intervention less effective than the best proven one, placebo, or no intervention will not 
be subject to additional risks of serious or irreversible harm as a result of no receiving the 
best proven intervention. Extreme care must be taken t o avoid abuse of this option.  
J. POST -TRIAL PROVISIONS

1.0 Background   
Diabetes  affects  one million  Veterans  who  receive  care  through  the Veteran  Affairs  Hospital  Administration  
(VHA),  and is associated  with  higher  mortality  and morbidity.  1 Effective  diabetes  self-care  is a critical  and 
complicated  aspect  of disease  control  in diabetes  that largely  contributes  to metabolic  control  and prevent s 
micro -vascular  and macro -vascular  complications  including  hypoglycemia,  eye disease,  kidney  failure,  and 
limb  threatening  foot infections,  cardiovascular  disease , and stroke . 2 Diabetes  self-management  requires  daily  
execution  of self-care  behaviors  and the subsequent  realization  of related  self-care  goals .3 Numerous  studie s 
have  documented  the association  between  diabetes  self-management  and improved  diabetes  outcomes .2, 4-7 
Diabetes  self-management   is largely  implemented  by patients  themselves  with  intermittent  instruction  from  
health  care  providers , 8  and typically  consists  of an ongoing,  demanding  daily  regimen  of (a) healthy  meal  
planning  with  regulati on of carbohydrate  and fat intake  and control  of body  weight , (b) planning  daily  physical  
activity,  (c) self-monitoring  blood  glucose  and avoiding  and treating  extreme  blood  glucose  fluctuations,  (d) 
managing  medications  (which  may  include  multiple  daily  injections ), (e) complying  with  periodic  diabetic  risk 
assessments , and (f) managing  stress.9 The key to successful  self-management  of diabetes  is the acquisition  of 
knowledge,  psychomotor  skills,  and effective  psychological  coping  to facilitate  lifestyle  modifications  and 
performance  of these  key self-care  tasks . 10 The amount  of time  required  to perform  diabetes  self-management  
varies  by diabetes  type  and severity , and requires  an average  commitment  of about  2 hours  per day. 11   
 
1.1 The  Demands  of Diabetes  Self -Management  Create  Diabetes –Related  Distress . 
The demands  of diabetes  self-management  often  result  in an independent  type  of psychologi cal anguish  known  
as diabetes -related  distress  (DRD) . DRD  arises  from  perceived  inability  to keep  up with  the requirements  and 
complexities  of diabetes  self-management12  and is associated  with  decreased  adherence , such  that 30%  of 
people  with  diabetes,  particularly  men,  neglect  to perform  important  elements  of self-care  11.  If prolonged,  a 
lapse  in diabetes  self-management  ultimately  predisposes  individuals  to poorer  metabolic  control , and higher  
rates  of diabetes -related  morbidity  and mortality.  6, 13 Moreover , decreased  adherence  to self-management  
behaviors  often  creates  interpersonal  strain  with  significant  others  and with  health  care  providers .14  
 
Although  the symptoms  of DRD  are similar  to that of clinical  depression,  with  which  it may  co-occur,  it is 
important  for health  care  providers  to distinguish  between  the two conditions  in order  to provide  appropriate  
therapeutic  options.  The reported  prevalence  of depressive  symptoms  among  patients  with  diabetes  ranges  
from  20 to 40%.15, 16 Patients  with  diabetes  and comorbid  depression  display  higher  functional  impairment ,17 
more  lost work  time ,18 poorer  diabetes  self-management , and more  comorbidities17 than  patients  with  diabetes  
alone .  However,  it has been  argued  that DRD , and not clinical  depression,  may  account  for many  of these  
reported  findings,  and is more  strongly  and independently  related  to behavioral  and clinical  measures  of 
diabet es self-care  than  is depression.19-21 Fisher  et.al have  demonstrated  that although  depressive  symptoms  
are prevalent  in individuals  who  have  diabetes , most  of these  people  are not clinically  depressed;  instead , they  
are distressed  about  their  diabetes , and feel a lack of self-efficacy  about  self-manag ing the disease .22 
 
 1.2 Diabetes  Self -Management  Education  (DSME)  is the Cornerst one of Diabetes  Self -
Management.  
DSME  is the primary  vehicle  through  which  diabetes  self-management  is 
promoted,  and focuses  on supporting  behaviors  that facilitate  achievement  of 
effective  diabetes  self-care  behaviors  and goals  as identified  by the American  
Association  of Diabetes  Educators  AADE7™  (Figure  1). 23 Multiple  studies  and 
meta -analyses  have  found  DSME  to be highly  cost-effective  for improving  
metabolic  and psychosocial  outcomes.  5, 24, 25 Healthy  coping,  defined  as the 
conscious  effort  to master,  minimize , and tolerate  stress,   including  personal  
and interpersonal  conflict , is the seventh , and typically  least  developed  and 
least  addressed , self-care  behavior  (see Figure  1). Traditionally,  DSME  
Figure 1.  AADE -7™ Self -Care 
Behaviors  
 
 
 
    
 programs  reference  the importance  of stress  management,  but stop  short  of providing  practical  support  for 
developing  necessary  coping  skills  that 
facilitate  diabetes  self care  and diabetes  control .26, 27 For example,  the VA’s  DSME  course  booklet , Self-Care  
Skills  for Patients  with  Diabetes  (VA,  Department  of Defense  clinical  practice  guideline,  2011) , encourages  
patients  to find ways  to manage  stress  management  by “limiting,  changing , or avoid ing stressful  situation s and 
making  time  to relax  and exercise ” in order  to achieve  and maintain  blood  glucose  control . Despite  this 
recommendation , useful  stress  management  support  tools  are not offered  as part  of the training.  
 
1.3 Mindfulness  is a Promising Tool for Stress Reduction . 
Mindfulness -based stress reduction strategies are promising tools for supporting comprehensive diabetes self -
management . Mindfulness is a secular concept adapted from Eastern philosophy that refers to self -regulated 
attention to the present moment experien ce with engagement of the five senses and an attitude of non -
judgment.28, 29  Mindfulness facilitates emotional regulation and modifies the way an individual reacts to 
difficult situations through the practice of attention, acceptance, and awareness.29 Emotional regulation and 
the acquisition of new perspectives lead to feelings of self -efficacy  by allowing difficult  situations to be reflected 
upon and responded to thought fully and without distraction  by pre-occupations with bodily sensations  or 
intrusive thoughts and  behaviors.30 Although mindfulness is not a relaxation technique in the traditional sense, 
increased awareness fostered by mindfulness practice has been associated with a state of physical and mental 
calmness that lowers stress -reactivity and strengthens coping behaviors.31, 32 Mindfulness is cultivated and 
strengthened through th e practice of meditation.  
 
Compelling neuro -physiologic research of meditation using functional magnetic resonance imaging, EEG, and 
other brain mapping techniques has shown characteristic changes in the brain physiology of individuals who 
had as little as  8 weeks of meditation training 33 and involve characteristic changes in the prefrontal cortex, 
occipito -temporal regions, and cortical insulae that c orrespond to areas of the brain involved in learning, 
memory, regulation of emotion, and executive functioning. 34-37  These findings suggest mechanisms for how 
the practice of mindful medi tation may enhance  emotio nal regulation and mental focus  that are very important  
for effective diabetes self -management . These cognitive processes control present -moment orientation, 
attention control, attention switching, how one views one’s own thoughts  (metacognition) , insight about one’s 
attitudes and bel iefs (metacognit ive awareness) , changing one’s  perspective on events/thoughts (cognitive 
restructuring) , exposure and desensitization (as opposed to avoidance behaviors),  and acceptance . 30, 38 39   
 
1.4 Mindfulness can be used  to Support  Chronic Disease Self -Management.  
Mindfulness -Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) is the standard -bearer  for mindfulness i nterventions  that are 
specific to chronic disease m anagement.  MBSR is a complementary mind -body medical therapy developed by 
Dr. Jon Kabat -Zinn and his team at the University of  Massachusetts School of Medicine . Similar to the Chronic 
Disease Self -Management Program (CDSMP ), MBSR  typically includes  eight we ekly 2 -hour sessions and also a 
half-day meditation retreat. Weekly classes include group discussion, breath -focused meditation, gentle yoga, 
and didactic  presentations on stress theory , mindful communications, and awareness trai ning. One of the 
program’s objective s is to help participant s become more aware of  in-the-moment  emotions, and physical 
sensations. Meditation instruction and practice  provide the foundation for MBSR, which  has been scientifically 
studied in many chronic health conditions since the early 1970’s including chronic pain ,40 cancer  41, rheumatoid 
arthritis ,42 fibromyalgia ,43 human immunodeficiency virus  (HIV ),44 solid organ transplantation ,45 psoriasis46, 
post -traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD )47, 48  and more recently in  diabetes .49,50-52  
 
During the past decade, an emerging body of research supports promising results of mindfulness -inspired 
interventions for reducing disease burden for individuals with diabetes. As with numerous other chronic health 
conditions, this approach has shown improved  psychological stress and  quality of life, but  the effects on 
metabolic outcomes  in diabetes  have been inconsistent and warrant further study. More specifically, a  seminal 
2007  obser vational pilot study of MBSR in  patients with Type 2 diabetes ( T2D M) demonstrated significant 
pre- to post  improvements in HbA1c , mean arterial blood pressure , and psychological distress , independent of 
weight loss, medication cha nges or lifestyle modification50. In partial contrast, two subsequent longitudinal , 
multisite trials  of MBSR conducted in people with type 1 diabetes ( T1DM) and T2D M, the Heidelberger 
Diabetes and Stress study  49 and the Diabetes and Mindfulness Study (DiaMind)  52  did not find effects on 
HbA1c , but  did detect  significant reductions in emotional distress. Furthermore, i n our own pilot work 
examining the effects of brief targeted mindfulness training as part of DSME (as opposed to intensive MBSR)  
for Veterans with diabetes , we found significant improvements in DRD  and diabetes self -management  that 
 
 
    
 
Figure 2. Study Conceptual Model of Allostatic Load, Personal Resources, 
and Diabetes Control  correlated with improved diabetes self -efficacy , as well as  a 1% reduction  in HbA 1c. These findin gs raise  
questions about the role of mindfulness as it applies to variables in  the diabetes self-care paradigm  (i.e. DRD , 
diabetes self -efficacy, and diabetes se lf-management behaviors)  and impact on diabetes outcomes such as 
glycemic control.  
 
1.5 Our  Conceptual  Framework  Includes  Previously  Unexamined  Variables  Related  to 
Mindfulness  and  Diabetes  Outcomes.   
The conceptual framework for this 
study (Figure 2) is underpinned by 
bio-psycho -social stress theory 14, 53 -57 
that posits a psychosocial intervention 
such as Mi nd-STRIDE can influence 
psychological (i.e., mindfulness, 
diabetes  self-efficacy, and DRD ), 
behavioral ( diabetes self -
management ), and biological 
(glycemic control) outcomes in the 
setting of an individual’s accumulated 
life stresses  (“allostatic load”)   and 
personal resources (i.e., genetic pre-
disposition and social support) . In our 
conceptual model, mindfulness , 
diabetes self -efficacy and DRD  (the 
primary outcome) are independent ly 
and synergistically affected by Mind -
STRIDE, the in dependent variable , as 
is diabetes self -management . Glycemic control , the distal secondary outcome , is affected by both changes in 
diabetes self -management  and through down -regulation of Hypothalami c-Pituitary -Adrenal Axis (HPA) 
feedback activity resulting in decreased insulin resistance and increased  blood glucose disposal.58 Although 
measurem ent of neuro -endocrine biomarkers is outside of the scope of this psycho -educational study, we 
include HPA axis activation in the conceptual model as an unmeasured  covariate, because of its relevance to 
the relationship between stress and metabolic glycemi c control.  
 
1.6 Confirmatory and Expanded Research is Needed Prior to Implementation of Mindfulness 
Interventions  in Diabetes Care  of Veterans . 
More research is needed to confirm and elucid ate the impact of mindfulness on  multiple aspects of diabetes 
self-care and outcomes, particularly in special populations such as Veterans, where Complementary and 
Alternative Medicine ( CAM ) initiatives are  increasingly being utilized as a group of  cost-effective, non -
pharmacologic  interventions . First, w hile the  effects of mindfulness interventions  on glycemic control remain 
unclear  based on results of the aforementioned limited number of studies , these studies do suggest , though  not 
definitively , that mindfulness may be specifical ly efficacious  for reducing DRD, which directly reflects diabetes 
quality of life and reduced disease burden. Additional research is therefore needed to  expand upon previous 
studies and  elucidate the relationship between mindfulness and reduction of DRD , and to examine additional 
relationships  involved in the complex landscape of diabetes self -care, and ultimately, glycemic control. More 
specifically , the large -scale trials did not examine the effects o f mindfulness on other related variables 
commonly understood to impact diabetes self -care, such as diabetes self -efficacy and individual diabetes self -
management behaviors .  
 
Furthermore, these questions particularly warrant closer  examination in the Veteran population for several 
reasons. Vetera ns are a unique population that  may have even greater clinical responsiveness to  a mindfulness 
intervention due to the ir higher prevalence of diabetes and diabetes -related burden than in the  general US 
population (11% vs. 8%), and greater physical and psychological vulnerability to stress -related conditions. For 
example, there is progressively more depression and post -traumatic stress in modern era Veterans compared 
to previous generations of  Veterans and to the US population at large.59 In addition, Veterans experience d 
more c hildhood trauma compared to the non -military population that has been linked to lifelong emotional 
difficulties, and may have even  led some Veterans to enlist in the military as a form of escape.60, 61  
 

 
 
    
 In order to support the testing of patient -centered, feasible, and sustainable interventions, we assert that the 
next phase of mindfulness research in diabetes n eeds to assess the efficacy of brief mindfulness training 
embedded in the context of routine DSME and care, where it has a natural, conceptual fit with the promotion of 
Healthy Coping, one of the 7 core pillars of DSME (Figure 1).  While successful programs such as the 
aforementioned CDSMP have been applied to patients with diabetes to facilitate self -care and stress 
reduction,62 program s such as this that entail  a series of lengthy  community -based  or online sessions that 
occur outsid e of routine healthcare visits may not be practical or appealing  to many of the Veterans who receive 
care through VHA.   
 
To address  this issue,  we developed  and pilot -tested  single  session  mindfulness  training  with  one booster  called  
Mindful  Stress  Reduction  in Diabetes  Education  (Mind -STRIDE) , which  is incorporated  into routine  DSME.   
At the VA Pittsburgh  Healthcare  System  (VAPHS),  a certified  nurse  diabetes  educator  and a dietitian  teach  
DSME  in one comprehensive  3-hour  participatory  group  class . The Mind -STRIDE  program  was adapted  from  
core  MBSR  tenets  and activities  presented  in Kabat -Zinn’s  book,  Full Catastrophe  Living : Using  Wisdom  of 
Your  Body  and Mind  to Face  Stress,  Pain,  and Illness ,29  and also  The Mindfulness  Based  Stress  Reduction  
Workbook  63  (Table  1). 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The Mind -STRIDE  curriculum  was adapted  with  expert  guidance  of Dr. Carol  Greco,  Co-Investigator,  who  is a 
highly  trained  and experienced  MBSR  teacher.  Mind -STRIDE  includes  meditation  training  and practice,  
mindful  movement  (seated  yoga  postures)  and discussions  similar  to those  presented  in the traditional  MBSR  
progra m that are aimed  at increasing  body  and sensory  awareness,  disentangling  thoughts,  and decreasing  
emotional  reactivity.  (See  Appendix  2 for additional  class  materials) .   
 
Our goal  is to build  upon  the preliminary  and pilot  work  described  below  by further  assessing  the efficacy  of 
Mind -STRIDE  in a full-scale  RCT  examining  its impact  on mindfulness,  diabetes  self-efficacy,  diabetes  self-
management , and glycemic  control  among  Veterans  with  diabetes.  
 
1.7 Releva nt Research —Preliminary  Studies  
 
We have  conducted  two surveys  and two pilot  studies  in preparation  for the current  RCT  proposal  that 
demonstrate  Veteran  preference  for accessible  and personalized  interventions,  as well as Mind -STRIDE’s  
feasible  and outcome -driven  approach  that warrants  efficacy  testing.

among  Veterans  (PI:   Monica  DiNardo,  PhD,  RN)  
Table 1. Summary of Mind -STRIDE: MBSR Topics and Content adapted from the work of Jon Kabat -
Zinn  

 
 
    
  
The purpose  of this descriptive  study  was to determine  Veteran  interest  in learning  more  about  stress  
management  and participating  in an 8-week  MBSR  program  at VAPHS.  We conducted  a survey  of 51 US 
Veterans  with  T2D M from  December  2008  to March  2009  at the VAPHS  Diabetes  Clinic.  Respondents  were  
mainly  white  (84%),  men (98%),  55 years  of age or older  (78%).  Of those  polled,  31 Veterans  (61%)  reported  
having  an interest  in attending  the MBSR  program.  Sixty -one percent  requested  printed  information  on stress  
management;  78%  identified  the MBSR  program’s  location  as being  a decisive  factor  to their  willingness  to 
participate  in a multiple -session  study . These  61%  of interested  respondents  identified  wanting  to attend  the 
program  for the following  reasons:  for general  stress  reduction  (48%);  to improve  diabetes  control  (23% ), to 
manage  weight  and overall  health  (20%),  to improve  self-esteem  (3%);  and/or  to learn  something  new (6%).  
Twenty  respondents  (39%)  had no interest  in attending  the proposed  MBSR  program;  reasons  for no interest  
included:  lack of transportation/unable  to commit  to eight  weekly  sessions  (40% ); having  no stress  or stress  
under  control  (45%)  or no interest  in this type  of program  (15%).  These  findings  were  presented  in a poster  
presentation  at the 2009  Eastern  Nursing  Research  Society  (ENRS)  conference  in Providence,  RI. 
 
Implications  for the proposed  study.  From  this survey  we gained  a sense  of the demographic  characteristics  
and interests  of patients  who  receive  care  at VAPHS  Diabetes  Specialty  clinic.  Although  their  degree  of interest  
in attending  a stress management  program  at VAPHS  was high,  we concluded  that recruitment  for a multi -
session  face to face program  at VAPHS  would  be difficult,  since  the travel  and time  commitment  was a barrier  
for many  of the Veterans  who  were  surveyed.  
 
1.7.2  Stress  Reduct ion in Diabetes  Education:  A Survey  of Interest  among  Diabetes  Educators   
(PI:   Monica  DiNardo,  PhD,  RN)  
 
The purpose  of this descriptive  survey  was to assess  Diabetes  Educators’  a) perceptions  of stress  among  their  
patients,  and b) willingness  to include  mindfulness  stress  management  training  as part  of DSME.  We 
conducted  a survey  of Diabetes  Educators  who  attended  a meeting  of the Western  Pennsylvania  Association  of 
Diabetes  Educators  in November  2014.  Of the 28 diabetes  educators  who  completed  the survey,  18 (64%) were  
Registered  Nurses,  11 of whom  were  Certified  Diabetes  Educators , five were  Advanced  Practice  Nurses , and two 
were  Bachelor  prepared  nurses ; and 10 (36%) were  Registered  Dietitian/Certified  Diabetes  Educators.  The 
average  number  of years  as a Diabetes  Educator  was 15 years  (range  6 months  -32 years).  Thirteen  of 28 (46%)  
respondents  personally  practice  yoga,  meditation,  or another  mind -body  approach  to manage  their  own  stress.  
Of the 28 respondents,  22 (79%)  reported  that their  patien ts often  or very  often  complain  that their  stress  is a 
barrier  to diabetes  self-management  and blood  glucose  control . Thirteen  of 28 (46%)  of the diabetes  educators  
surveyed  teach  group  DSME  classes,  and four  of them  consistently  provide  stress  management  education  as 
part  of their  group  classes.   Reasons  given  for not currently  providing  stress  management  training  within  
DSME  were  time  constraints,  lack of expertise,  limited  scientific  evidence,  and lack of inclusion  in the pre-
existing  DSME  curriculum.  Nineteen  of 28 diabetes  educators  (68%)  surveyed  would  consider  adding  brief  
mind -body  stress  management  training  as part  of group  DSME  as long  as it was evidence -based,  time  -
efficient,  and was written  into their  model  of care.  
 
Implications  for the propose d study.  We concluded  from  this survey  that patients  frequently  inform  diabetes  
educators  that stress  is a barrier  to diabetes  self-care  and blood  glucose  control.  In general,  there  was interest  
among  the diabetes  educators  surveyed  for adding  a brief  mind -body  stress  reduction  intervention  to DSME,  
and that brief,  evidence  based  mindfulness  programs  relevant  to DSME  are needed.  
 
1.7.3 Exploring Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction on Women with Type 2 Diabetes: A Mixed 
Methods Pilot Study  (PI:  Monica DiNardo, PhD, RN)  
 
 The aims of this 2010 prospective observational pilot study of women with T2D M (n=6) was to a) explore the 
acceptability of MBSR in women with T2D M who attended a community health center MBSR program, and b) 
identify the b est strategies, outcome measures, an d the logistics for conducting a successful MBSR program. 
The 8 -week MBSR intervention consisted of weekly two -hour sessions and a half -day silent retreat taught by 
Dr. Carol Greco, Co -Investigator.  We gathered pre -post  data on HbA1c, blood pressure, body mass index 
(BMI), waist circumference, lipid profile, and C -reactive protein (CRP), a marker of non -specific inflammation.  
Mindfulness (Mindfulness Attention Awareness Scale , MAAS ), global perceived stress, (Perceived Stress 
Scale <PSS -10), diabetes stress (Problem Areas in Diabetes Scale , PAID ), quality of life ( SF-36), and metabolic 
 
 
    
 control (HbA1c)  were  measured at baseline, at completion of the 12 -week intervention, and one -month post -
intervention follow -up at 16 weeks. At baseline , participants’  mean age was 55.7 years, mean HbA1c was 6.9%, 
and mean duration of diabetes was 4.9 years. Participants were primarily  white (86%), college educated 
(71.4%), and had multiple co -morbid conditions  (>4; 86%).  
 
Six of 14 -screened candidates were enrolled in the study; the remaining eight eligible candidates did not enroll  
due to time conflicts with the MBSR class schedule. All enrolled participants completed the 12 -week study.  
Even with this very small sample, we found  significant pre -post intervention changes in improved mindfulness, 
decreased perceived stress, decreased diabetes stress, and a 1% decrease in HbA1c. These c hanges were 
sustained at 1 -month post intervention follow -up except in HbA1c. Qualitative data were gathere d by 
structured interviews at 1 6 weeks post -intervention to explore participants’ experience with the MBSR 
program and its perceived importance to their diabetes self -care. All of the participants reported very high 
satisfaction with the program and would recommend MBSR to other people with and without diabetes.  Five of 
the six participants intended to continue practicing mindfulness in their daily lives. The participants 
unanimously recommended adding diabetes -specific content to future MBSR programs. Concept analysis was 
performed usi ng grounded theory methodology ,64 and two qualitative themes were identified : 1) Improved 
coping (e.g. “…more confident …” “easier to cope” ; “…lowered my reaction to things…”; “…it makes it easier to 
calm down and deal with aggravation and pain of diabetes…”), and  2) Connecting mind and body (e.g. 
“…able to visualize what is  going on internally…” ; “…motivated me to exercise and take better care of myself ; 
I can now ‘breathe through’ my pain”) . 
 
Implications for the proposed study.  MBSR was positively received and showed promise of benefit to women 
with T2D M. These findings support the feasibility of conducting an experimental study of MBSR in women 
with T2D M, and found positive changes in perceived stress, diabetes related distress , and HbA1c. Efforts to 
recruit community participants with T2D M who were available to participate in an 8 -week program proved 
challenging however. Furthermore, the generic community MBSR program did not address diabetes -specific 
issues important to these study participants. We utilized what we learned from these findings to overcome 
barriers to our diabetes -specific mindfulness intervention, Mind -STRIDE. As a result of this small pilot study, 
the PI  collaborated with Dr. Greco to design an accessible one -session intervention that incorporates 
fundamental tenets of MBSR and addresses diabetes -specific concerns, including mindful eating and using 
self-compassion to deal with interpersonal difficulties surrounding self -management issues.  
 
1.7.4 A Mindful Appr oach to Diabetes Self -Management Education with Stress Reduction and 
Healthy Coping for US Veterans with Diabetes  (PI:  Monica DiNardo, PhD, RN)  
  
The purpose of this pilot study was to determine the feasibility and acceptability of our Mind -STRIDE 
interve ntion in a prospective observational study in a sample of Veterans with T1D M and T2D M at VAPHS. 
Study participants were recruited from DSME classes at VAPHS. Participants who had diabetes for at least six 
months, took a stable regimen of diabetes medicatio ns for at least one month, and had a baseline HbA1c 
greater than 7% were eligible to participate.  Regarding feasibility and acceptability, we tracked  participant 
recruitment and retention, and measured Veteran and Diabetes Educator satisfaction with Mind -STRI DE by 
self-report rating scales and interviews.  Secondarily, we assessed the effects of Mind - STRIDE on  perceived 
stress  (PSS -10), DRD  (PAID) , and self -efficacy  (Diabetes Empowerment Scale, DES -SF), diabetes self -
management (AADE-7™Self -care Behaviors), and HbA1c over time, from baseline to 3 -month post 
intervention.  
 
In this study, 60% (28/47) of eligible Veterans agreed to participate, and 71% (20) of enrolled participants 
completed the three -month study.  At least half of th e participants who dropped out did so because of comorbid 
medical or behavioral conditions (Table 2). Our sample was unemployed or retired ( 82%) older males (mean 
age 63 years) who were overweight (mean BMI 33 kg/m2) and had T2D M; 54% were   college educated . Median  
diabetes duration was 18.2 years (range 6 months - 55 years), and mean baseline HbA1c was 8.8%.

There was a high level of 
acce ptance among clinicians and 
Veteran participants. Clinician 
acceptance of Mind -STRIDE was 
measured by a brief structured  
interview and 10 point rating scale (1= this program was not useful at all; 10 = this program was excellent and 
met the needs of the class). The course instructors rated the program 8. 5 out of 10, and thought the program 
was pertinent to “what’s missing” in DSME. Veteran participant satisfaction  with Mind -STRIDE was assessed 
with a 4 -item satisfaction questionnaire and free-text comment section; 96%  of participants  strongly agreed 
that they learned something new and planned to continue practicing mindfulness meditation in the future; 
92% would recommend Mind -STRIDE  to other people with diabetes.  Daily paper and pencil diary entries 
assessed participant acceptance, experience, and freque ncy of home practice.  Eleven (39%) of the participants 
completed home practice diaries indicating an average home practice frequency and duration of 12 minutes 
three times per week.  
 
Qualitative data were gathered from the free -text comment section of  participant satisfaction questionnaires 
and the home practice diaries to provide insight into Veteran satisfaction and acceptance  of their experience 
with  Mind -STRIDE. Qualitative data was coded by two coders using   modified  Grounded  Theory ,  and was 
organized by theme with 100% agreement. Participant quotes and themes appear in Table 3.

 Nonparametric repeated measures analysis and post -hoc pairwise comparisons were applied to the 
quantitative data using the Friedman’s Test and Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test respectively and demonstrated a 
statistically significant reduction in DRD  from baselin e to 3 -months post intervention (p< .01; d= .7) . 
Significant improvements in  diabetes self -management  (p< .05; d= .5), and a 1% reduction in HbA1 c (p<. 05; 
d= .7) were also observed. After 3 -months of mindfulness practice, significant correlations were found between 
psychological outcomes and specific elements of Mindfulness that were not present at baseline (Table 4).

Impl ications for the proposed study.  We pilot -tested the feasibility of operationalizing Mind -STRIDE within 
existing DSME classes. Rates of recruitment and retention were generally good, Veteran satisfaction and 
engagement and staff satisf action and enthusiasm were high . However,  only 39% of participants completed 
diaries, therefore we concluded that the use of paper home pra ctice diaries was inefficient for tracking home 
practice. We believe hand -held digital devices will be easier and more appealing to the participants and 
therefore will increase participation in this exercise. These  devices can be used for more portable and  
convenient access to the au dio-recorded guided meditations and for real -time documentation of home 
meditation practice; and  they  can also serve as a  home practice  journal .  This pilot study paved the way for 
taking the next step, testing the effects of t he intervention on glycemic control and intermediary psycho -
behavioral outcomes in the proposed RCT.  
 
2.0 Significance  
 
One in four US veterans who receive care through the VHA have diabetes, which means that at any given time 
more than one million Veterans look to the VHA for diabetes care and self -management support.1 
Management of diabetes depends upon self -management behaviors to regulate metabolic control and prevent 
or delay micro -vascular and macro -vascular complications. Advanced micro -vasc ular complications of diabetes 
are the leading causes of blindness, non -traumatic amputations, and end -stage kidney disease in the US and in 
VHA. VHA patients have a higher rate of diabetes (11% vs. 8%) compared to the general  US population. 
Advanced macro -vascular complications such as myocardial infarction and stroke contribute to higher 
mortality rates in VA patients with diabetes, which average 5% compared to 2.6% among patients without 
diabetes, and is a major cause of deaths and inpatient admissions outside of VHA1. Diabetes is one of the top 
medical conditions requiring hospital admissions and 30 -day readmissions, and therefore is a significant 
contributor to escalating health care costs.65  
 
The anticipated  impact  of this study  is to decrease  DRD  and enhance  self-efficacy  to improve  diabetes  self-care  
behaviors  through  mindfulness  and potentially  improve  glycemic  control  among  Veterans.  Because  DRD  
interferes  with  self-care  behaviors,  our program  has potential  for significantly  impacting  and advancing  the 
health  and health  care  of Veterans  because  it targets  a serious  and prevalent  problem  that is not currently  well-
addressed  within  the context of diabetes  care.  The proposed  mindfulness  study  will extend  knowledge  of the 
feasibility  and effects  of providing  a practical,  low cost,  mind -body  intervention  that can be offered  as a part of 
routine  DSME,  and has already  been  successfully  pilot -tested in a sample  of Veterans  who  found  it acceptable  
and helpful.   This  is not surprising  in that approximately  21 million  US adults,  including  Veterans,  practice  
mindfulness  or some  form  of meditation.66 Mindfulness  is increasingly  incorporat ed into Complementary  CAM  
initiatives  in VHA.  Mindfulness  is one of the top five most  frequently  used  mind -body  CAM  modalities  at VA 
facilities.  Studies  of mindfulness  meditation  in Veterans  with  PTSD  have  shown  improvements  in PTSD  
symptoms  and improvemen ts in quality  of life. 47, 67 Over  5,000  Veterans  have  been  treated  with  mindfulness  
meditation  at VA facilities  for anxiety,  PTSD,  depression  and stress  management.68 Over  half of VHA  facilities  
have  existing  procedures  for mindfulness  in place  and offer  mindfulness  therapy  primarily  to Veterans  Mindfulness

 receiving  outpatient  care.  Howeve r, mindfulness  meditation  has not been  studied  or applied  to the care  of 
patients  with  diabetes  within  VHA.  
 
The proposed study supports VHA National Nursing Strategic Plan (2013 -18) goal 1a(4) by testing the 
integration of a new nurse -led initiative into a patient -centered program of specialty care. This proposal also 
corresponds with VHA Blueprint for Excellence (9 -2014) transformational action 7.2  by testing a program that 
will enhance  VA Research on CAM . Empowering Veterans to improve their own wellbeing is one of the driving 
strategies behind VA CAM research. VHA has funded 13 mind -body studies in partnership with the National 
Center for Complementar y and Alternative Medicine that target pain and PTSD  in active duty personnel and in 
Veterans and their families. However, currently, t here are no planned VA studies of mindfulness -based 
therapies for diabetes.   
 
Considering the cumulative effects of stress and the number of military Veterans who suffer from co -morbid 
depression and PTSD, 57, 69 Veterans with diabetes are at particular risk for negative consequences of diabetes 
distress . Mind -STRIDE re -directs the current intervention paradigm for DSME and diabetes care, and could 
pay-off with a ready -to-use p rogram choice for Veterans that offers effective psycho -behavioral self -
management support through patient -aligned care. Considering that our Co -Investigators are prominent VA, 
national, and international leaders, Dr. Rao and Dr. Siminerio in the field of diabetes care and education, and 
Dr. Bormann and Dr. Greco in meditation and mindfulness, the likelihood of uptake of findings and 
recommendations from the proposed research is high. Mind -STRIDE has minimal potential for harm, and 
holds promise for enhanci ng the physical and psychological health of Veterans to better equip them to 
“manage their own lives and achieve their own goals .”1 We also anticipate that in the future, programs similar 
to Mind -STRIDE might have applicability for supporting Veterans’ self -management goals in prevention and 
maintenance of other chronic conditions.  In fact, this study is  closely aligned with currently  and previously 
NRI - funded mindfulness and meditation trials for PTSD67 and cardiovascular risk in women (The Mindful 
Hearts Trial). Together these nurse -led studies  will build upon one another to make substantial contributions 
to the emerging literature and science of mindfulness and meditation in Veterans who are at risk for and suffer 
from chronic diseases.  
 
2.1 Innovation  
 
Our intervention  is noteworthy  and novel  in four  ways:   
 
a) Content:  Mind -STRIDE  is an original  VA pilot -tested  intervention  adapted  from  an evidence -
based  Mindfulness  training  model,  MBSR  
b) Accessibility:  Our program  incorporates  a brief,  accessible  mindfulness -based  intervention  
provided  at the point  of diabetes  care,  and tests  the efficacy  of a potentially  new diabetes  care  
process  geared  toward  uptake  and sustainability   
c) Design:  Our study  is the first to apply  a qualitative  analysis  of mindfulness  in people  who  have  
diabetes,  which  actively  supports  the design  and implementation  of  a new patient – centered  
diabetes  paradigm  
d) Measurement:  Our study  is the first to utilize  common  technology  (digital  tablets ) to capture  
adherence  to home  mindfulness  practice  in real time,  as well as utilize  existing  VA Tele -Health  
technology  for verification  of home  blood  glucose  data  
 
3.0 RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS  
 
3.1. Design  
 
This study is a 2-arm single -site mixed -methods randomized controlled efficacy trial of a mindfulness 
intervention to reduce DRD  among Veterans with diabetes.  Participants will be randomized to one of two 
study conditions:  the experimental group (DSME+ Mind -STRIDE)  and the usual care group (DSME -Alone) . 
Research  assessments will occur at baseline  (T1), 12- weeks  (T2) , and at 24 weeks  (T3)  for both study arms. 
Satisfaction assessments  will be conducted in the experimental group following the Week 4 booster.  
Qualitat ive telephone interviews will  be conducted at 15 weeks  in a sub group  of purposively sampled 
participants in the experimental group.  
 
 
 
    
 3.2 Setting  
 
This  study  will be conducted  at the University  Drive  (UD)  campus  of VA Pittsburgh  Healthcare  System  
(VAPHS ), an integrated  healthcare  system  affiliated  with  the University  of Pittsburgh  that serves  the Veteran  
population  throughout  the tri-state  area  of Pennsyl vania,  Ohio,  and West  Virginia.  VAPHS  is a major  tertiary  
care  institution  comprised  of two facilities  and is the hub to five smaller  “spoke”  facilities  in the region ; it 
provides  specialty  diabetes  care  to five regional  Community -Based  Outpatient  Clinics  (CBOC s), for which  it 
provides  diabetes  specialty  care  services.  VAPHS  provides  outpatient  health  care  to approximately  17,000  US 
Veterans  with  diabetes  annually,  28%  of the total  number  of patients  served.  The UD location  is the only  VA 
location  in the tri-state  area  of Southwestern  Pennsylvania,  Southeastern  Ohio  and Northern  West  Virginia  
that has a Diabetes  Specialty  clini c and offers  group  DSME  classes  (Additional  information  about  VAPHS  is 
found  in the Facilities  and Resources  section .) The Diabetes  Clinic  is housed  within  the multi -disciplinary  
Medical  clinic  in the hospital  facility  at UD, and is staffed  by four  boar d certified  endocrinologists,  two nurse  
practitioners  (one  is the PI), three  certified  diabetes  nurse  educators,  and a dietitian.  The staff  diabetes  
educators  and dietitian  provide  individual  diabetes  education  in the outpatient  clinic  by appointment  in 
addition  to teaching  the comprehensive  group  DSME  classes.  Group  classes  are held  twice  monthly  throughout  
the year  in a conference  room  at UD and are offered  twice  monthly  via direct  video -conferencing  from  UD to 
Veterans  gathered  at spoke  facilities.  The coordinating  diabetes  nurse  educator  co-teaches  the DSME  class  with  
the dietitian  and received  over  300 DSME  referrals  from primary  care  and specialty  clinic  providers  at UD and 
160 referrals  from  spoke  facility  providers  in 2014 .  The VA DSME  program  meets  national  standards  and 
maintains  recognition  by the America  Diabetes  Association  (ADA)  Education  Recognition  Program  (ERP) .24 
 
3.3 Population  and  Sample

3.4 Procedures  
 
An overview  of the study  design  and procedures  appears  in Figure  3.   All participants  enrolled  in DSME  will be 
pre-screened  by the Research  Assistant,  pursuant  to IRB approv ed HIPPA  Waiver , for inclusion  and exclusion  
criteria.  Prior  to the DSME  class,  the staff  diabetes  educator  will contact  eligible  candidates  to obtain  assent . 
The Research  Assistant  or Research  Coordinator  will then  contact  assenting  participants  for telephone  
screen ing for additional  inclusion/exclusion  criteria  pursuant  to an IRB approved  Waiver  of Documentation  of 

 
 
    
 Informed  Consent  for Screening .  After  informed  consent  procedures  are completed,  enrolled  participants  will 
complete  Baseline  (T1) pencil -and paper  research  
assessments  administered  in-person  by the 
Research  Assistant .  After  completion  of T1 
assessments,  participants  will be randomly  
assigned  to either  the experimental  condition  
(DSME+  Mind -STRIDE)  or the usual  care   
condition  (DSME  -Alone)  (See  Randomization  
Procedure).  Subsequent  post-intervention  research  
assessments  will be completed  at week  12 (T2)  and 
week  24 (T3), and will consist  of biological  
measures   (height , weight,  blood  pressure,  and 
laboratory  assessment  of HbA1c ) performed  by 
clinical  staff , and completion  of paper  and pencil  
assessments  administered  in person  by the 
Research  Assistant  or Research  Coordinator.   In 
the DSME  + Mind -STRIDE  group,  participants  will 
also complete  the participant  satisfaction  
assessment  administered  by the Interven tionist  
following  the 4-week  booster .  A purposively  
sampled  subset  of 25-participants  will complete  a 
qualitative  telephone  interview  at 15-weeks  
(between  T2 and T3). 
 
Participants  in both  groups  will attend  the 4-week  
DSME  follow -up booster  visit  with  the staff  
dietitian  who  is not part  of the study  team.   The 
study  interventionist  will deliver  the Mind -STRIDE  
booster  to participants  in the experimental  group  immediately  follo wing  that dietitian  visit.  The Interventionist  
will administer  the satisf action  questionnaire  to Mind -STRIDE  participant s after  completion  of the booster  
session,  and will ensure  confidentiality  by asking  participants  to seal completed  survey s in provided  envelope s.  
In addition,  all participants  will receive  a monthly  post -card  from  the study  team  to help  promote  engagement  
and retention  in the study.  All participants  will receive  reimbursement  for participation  in the study  following  
each  assessment  ($50  at T1, $75 at T2, and $100  at T3) and will also receive  a digital  tablet  as remuneration  for 
their  participation.  DSME  + Mind -STRIDE  participants  will receive  the tablet  following  the initial  Mind -
STRIDE  intervention;  DSME –Alone  participants  receive  the tablet  following  completion  of T3. 
 
 
3.4.1 Randomization Procedure   
 
After screening and written informed consent procedures have been completed, all eligible research participants 
entering the study will complete baseline procedures. After baseline assessments are completed, participants will 
be randomized into one of two groups: 1) DSME + Mind -STRIDE (the experimental group), or 2) DSME -Alone 
(usual care). The study statistician will perform the randomization process using statistical softw are with a 
random -number generator to create a list of group assignments before study recruitment begins. Randomization 
will occur in blocks of 4 or 6 , and the group  assignments will be  created based on the specific number of  expected 
eligible participants . 
 
3.5 Description of Usual Care and Experimental Conditions  
 
Participa nts in both conditions will continue their usual diabetes care as per their diabetes care provider s.  
They will self -monitor their blood glucose according to instructions provided by their diabetes care providers, 
and will transmit data from their home blood glucose meters using  standard VA issued Home Tele -Health 
equipment  that is available and offered to all patients . 
 
3.5.1 Usual Care Condition (DSME -Alone)  
 
Figure 3. Study Design and Procedures  

 
 
    
 Patients randomized to the Usual Care Condition (DSME -Alone) will receive the standard  3-hour DSME class  
that includes a  didactic presentation, discussion, and interactive activities using a booklet and power point 
slides covering the following topics:  
a) An overview of diabetes pathophysiology, HbA1c, major elements of DSM; distinguishing between 
T1DM and T2D M 
b) Eating Healthy - identifying nutrients, reading food labels, choosing healthy portion sizes

        recent exams, and vaccines.  
 
Participants in the Usual Ca re (DSME -Alone) condition also receive a 30 - minute booster with the staff 
dietitian in which basic self -management skills  and goals  from DSME class are reinforced.  
 
3.5.2 Experimental C ondition (DSME +Mind -STRIDE)   
 
Participants randomized to the Experimental Condition (DSME +Min d-STRIDE) will receive the same 3-hour 
DSME group class  (described above) plus the 1-hour Mind -STRIDE intervention  delivered by the Study 
Interventions that includes  the following topics and activities : 
a) Group  discussion : exploring the stress of living with diabetes (5 minutes)  
b) Meditation practice: Being in your body,  “Body Scan  Technique”  (10 minutes)  
c) Group activity (“the raisin -eating  exercise”): promoting awareness and differentiation between 
thoughts, judgements,  and sensory perceptions (5 minutes)  
d) Didactic presentation and group discussion of stress theory ; stress and diabetes; responding vs. 
reacting to stressful situations  (15 minutes)  
e) Mindful movement (chair yoga)  (5 minutes)  
f) Didactic presentation of  mindfulness  and mindful approaches to diabetes self -management , (10 
minutes)  
g) Group d iscussion: mindfulness in every day life , mindful eating  (5 minutes)  
h) Group activity: setting  intentions /commit ment  for daily home mindfulnes s practice . Table ts are 
distributed . (5 minutes ) 
 
The DSME + Mind -STRIDE group will also receive  one 30 minute Mind -STRIDE booster  session  with the 
Study Interventionist  in addition to the DSME booster with the staff dietician. The  Mind -STRIDE  booster 
consists  of: 
a) 20 minutes of discussion /reinforcement of mindfulness concepts   
b) 10 minutes o f guided mindfulness meditation practice  
 
The D SME+ Mind -STRIDE group will be encouraged to engage in at least 15 
minutes of home mindfulness practice 6 days per week consisting of:  
a) 15-minutes of mindful meditation practice   
b) One daily mindfulness activity  (e.g. mindfully eating one meal)  
c) Real -time tracking of  home meditation practice using 
Mindfulness Coach, a VA -developed and supported application 
(Figure 4 ). 
Figure 4. VA Mindfulness Coach 
Application  
 
 
    
 d) Optional journaling to reflect  the home practi ce experience  answering the question “What did you 
notice?”   
 
Participants have the option of using  3-pre-loaded  audio recor dings on the table ts that were created by the 
PI and Dr. Greco to  guide their home practice and reinforce the guiding mindfulness principles taught 
during  the intervention.  Participants will also access the pre -loaded Mindfulness Coach  application for 
additional home practice support and to  docume nt home meditation practice . Recorded materials will be 
downloaded at each research visit. None of the data stored on the tablets w ill contain identifiable 
information , and personal use of the tablets’ internet  features will be blo cked during the course of study  
 
3.6 Variables  and  Measures    
 
3.6.1 Quantitative  Measures  
 
Diabetes -Related  Distress  (DRD ), the primary  outcome,  will be measured  with  the Problem Areas  in 
Diabetes  scale  (PAID) . The PAID  questionnaire  will also be used  for Screening  to determine  inclusion  criteria  
of moderate  to high  baseline  DRD  (PAID  score>10) . It comprises  20 items  that desc ribe common  negative  
feelings  associated  with  having  diabetes  e.g. “Feeling  scared  when  you think about  living  with  diabetes? ”; “Not  
having  a clear  and concrete  goal  for your  diabetes  care?”  that are answered  on a 5-point  Likert  scale  (“Not a 
problem ” to “Serious  problem ”). Item  scores  are summed  to provide  a total  score  of emotional  distress,  scores  
range  from  0-100, with  higher  scores  denoting  greater  distress.  Scores  over  40 denote  burn -out, while  scores  of 
10 or less may  reflect  denial.  The PAID  scale  has high  internal  relia bility  (Cronbach’s  alpha  >.90),  and has 
shown  effect  sizes  between  0.30  and 0.65  across  different  psychosocial,  educational,  and medical  
interventions .19 
 
Mindfulness - Two validated measures, a multi -faceted measure, the Five Facet Mindfulness Qu estionnaire 
(FFMQ), and a one -dimensional  measure, the Revised Cognitive and Affective Mindfulness Scale (CAMS -R), 
will measure mindfulness.  The FFMQ and CAMS -R measures self -reported mindfulness differently and are 
being used to address the complexity of assessing the construct.  Mindfulness wil l be measured as a secondary 
outcome for Aim1 .   
 
The 5 -Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ) is a validated questionnaire consisting of 39 items on a 5 -
point Likert scale (“Never o r Very rarely true” to “Very often or A lways true”) based on a factor anal ytic study of 
5-independently developed mindfulness questionnaires.  It measures 5 -facets representing elements of 
mindfulness: observing, which refers to noticing or attending to internal and external experiences, such as 
thoughts, sensations, emotions, s ounds, sights, and smells; describing, which refers to the ability to describe 
one’s emotions and feelings; acting with awareness, which includes attending to one ’s activities in the present 
moment; non -judging of inner experience, which refers to taking a  non-evaluative attitude toward thoughts 
and feelings; and non -reactivity to inner experience, which includes allowing thoughts and feelings to come 
and go, without getting caught up in or carried away by them. Higher scores reflect greater levels of each factor.  
Each factor consists of 7 or 8 items. The five facets demonstrated adequate to good internal consistency (alpha 
ranging from 0.75 to 0.91) when tested in experienced meditators and non -meditators. 70  
 
The Revised 12 -item Cognitive and Affective Mindfulness Scale (CAMS -R) is a  one-dimensional, 12 -item 
inventory on a 4 point  Likert scale (“Rarely/Not at all” to “A lmost always”) t hat measures mindfulness during 
general daily occurrences on four components of mindfulness (i.e., attention, awareness, present -focus, and 
acceptance/non -judgment)  and yields one total score.   Higher  scores denote greater mindfulness. The internal 
consistency of the CAMS -R in this sample is adequate ( alpha = .76), and there is evidence of convergent and 
discriminant validity with concurrent measures of mindfulness, distress, well -being, emotion -regulat ion, and 
problem -solving approaches .71  
 
Self -Efficacy  will be measured  with  the Diabetes  Self-Efficacy  Scale  (DSES).  This  self-administered  
questionnaire  consists  of 8-items  on a 10 point  Likert  scale  (1= Not confident  at all; 10 = Totally  confident ) 
that measures  self-efficacy  in diabetes  self-management  activities,  with  higher  score  denoting  greater  diabetes  
self-efficacy.  Content  validity  of the DSES  was supported  in a study  of 186 subjects  who  completed  a six-week  
community  diabetes  education  and lifestyle  progr am. The internal  consistency  reliability  of this instrument  is 
high  (alpha=.83).72 

 
 
    
  
Diabetes  Self -Management  will be measured  with  the Self-Care  Inventory  Revised  (SCI -R), a 
psychometrically  sound  15-item  self-administered  survey  that measures  perceived  adherence  to recommended  
diabetes  self-care  behaviors  of adults  with  T1DM  and T2DM.  Higher  scor es reflect  greater  diabetes  self-
management  behaviors.  It was tested  in 3 separate  studies  in 554 adults  with  diabetes  and found  to have  high  
internal  consistency  (r=.63).  Its construct  validity  is supported  by correlations  with  diabetes  distress  (r=-.36);  
self-esteem  (r=.25)  self-efficacy  (r=.47),  depression  (r=-.22) anxiety  (r=-.24) and HbA1c  (r=-.37).  
Responsiveness  analysis  showed  SCI-R scores  improved  with  diabetes  psycho -education  with  a medium  effect  
size of 0.62  and a Guyatt  responsiveness  statistic  of 0.85.73 
 
Glycemic  control,  i.e., HbA1c , the secondary  (distal)  metabolic  outcome , will be assessed  at each  time  point:  
T1, T2, and T3. All tests  will be performed  at VAPHS  laboratories  according  to National  Glyco -hemoglobin  
Standardization  Program  approved  methods  using  high  performance  liquid  chromatography  (Tosoh  Bioscience  
South  San Francisco,  CA).    
 
Potential Covariates  
 
Frequency  and duration  of mindfulness  practice  will be measured  by participant  entries  using  the VA 
Mindfulness  Coach  Application.  This  application  is a user  -friendly  method  for timing  and tracking  meditation  
practice  (in minutes)  that also includes  guided  meditations  and formats  for personalized  meditation  sounds  
and music .  
 
Depression  will be measured  with  the Patient  Health  Questionnaire  (PHQ -9), a widely  used brief  9-item  
instrument  adapted  from  the longer  PHQ  for measuring  the severity  of symptoms  of depression  over  the past  
two weeks.  The assessment  can be administered  repeatedly,  and can reflect  improvement  or worsening  of 
symptoms.  Response  options  are on a 4-point  Likert  scale  (0=”Not  at all”; 3=”N early  every  day”). Item  9 
assesses  for the presence  and duration  of suicidal  ideation.  A tenth  non-scored  question  assigns  weight  to the 
degree  to which  depressive  problems  have  affected  the patient’s  level  of function.   The validity  of PHQ -9 was 
tested  in 15 studies  in primary  care  and obstetrical  clinics.  PHQ  scores  ≥ 10 had a sensitivity  of 88%  and a 
specificity  of 88%  for major  depression.  PHQ -9 scores  of 5, 10, 15 and 20 represent  mild,  moderate  and 
moderat ely severe  and severe  depression  respectively.   We will follow  VAPHS  policy  for suicide  assessment/  
crisis  treatment  for those  with  positive  responses  to item  9.74 
 
Post -Traumatic  Stress  will be measured  with  the psychometrically  valid  PTSD  checklist  for DSM -5 (PCL -5) 
a 20-item  self-report  measure  that assesses  the 20 DSM -5 symptoms  of PTSD  over  the past  month  on a scale  of 
0 (“Not  at all”)  to 4 (“Extremely”).  Higher  scores  reflect  greater  PTSD.  Evidence  for the PCL  for DSM -4 
suggests  that a 5-10 point  change  represents  reliable  change  (i.e., change  not due to chance)  and a 10-20 point  
change  represents  clinically  significant  change.  Change  scores  for PCL -5 are currently  being  determined.  It is 
expected  that reliable  and clinically  meaningful  change  will be in a similar  range,  but is subject  to further  
validation.  
 
Social  Support  will be measured  with  The Support  Attitudes  Sub-scale  of the Diabetes  Care  Profile  (DCP),  a 
self-administered  questionnaire  that assesses  social  and psychological  factors  related  to diabetes  and its 
treatment.  The DCP  Support  Attitudes  Subscale  consists  of 4 questions:  one single  answer  multiple -choice  
question  and three  other  questions,  each  with  6 sub-questions,  on a 5-point  Likert  scale  (“Strongly  disagree”  to 
“Strongly  agree”).  Higher  subscale  scores reflect  greater  social  support  or social  support  needs .  Cronbach’s  
alpha  for the Support  Attitudes  Subscale  was .69 and .73 demonstrating  reliability.   The Social  Attitudes  
Subscale  is significantly  (p .01) correlated  with  The Social  Provisions  Scale  (r=.51),  CES  depression  scale  (r=-
.35) and the Happiness  and Satisfaction  scale  (r=.25)  demonstrating  concurrent  validity.75 
 
Comorbidity  will be measured  with  the Charlson  Self-Report  Comorbidity  Index,  a reproducible  and valid  16-
item  self-report  questionnaire  that includes  items  corresponding  to each  element  of the medical  record -based  
Char lson  index,  a commonly  used  comorbidity  risk assessment.  Higher  scores  reflect  greater  comorbidity.  The 
questionnaire  was tested  in 170 hospital  inpatients  and compared  to Charlson  scores  abstracted  from  these  
patients’  medical  records.  Responses  are dicho tomous  yes or no answers  to the questions,  “Has  a doctor  or 
other  health  care  provider  ever  told you that you have…”  Test -retest  reliability  assessed  with  the intra -class  
correlation  coefficient  was 0.91  for the questionnaire  and 0.92  for the chart -based  Charlson  index.  Spearman  
 
 
    
 correlation  between  these  two measures  was 0.63.  The correlation  between  comorbidity  measures  was weaker  
in less educated  patients,  but overall  offers  practical  advantages  over  intensive  medical -record  based  
assessments  particularly  for use as a screening  tool.  Scores  above  75 are considered  to represent  high  
comorbidity.76 
 
Demographic characteristics  will be measured with  an investigator -created questionnaire developed 
specifically for this study and includes age, race, ethnicity, duration of diabetes, diabetes medications, changes 
to diabetes medications within the past 60 days, marital status, occupation, employment statu s, and highest 
level of education completed.  
 
Patient satisfaction  with DSME+  Mind -STRIDE class will be measured with  the Patient Satisfaction 
Questionnaire (PSQ), an 8 -item, self -report questionnaire used to measure general satisfaction with overall 
heal thcare services and mental health care in particular. 77 It has high internal consistency with alphas ranging 
from .90 to .94. The items have been modified slightly to apply to our intervention. Instrument reproduced

3.6.3 Participant Burden  
 
The total estimated time it will take to participate in the study beyond that of usual care over the 24 week study 
duration for the DSME -Alone group is approximately 5-hours , and 30 -hours for the DSME+ Mind -STRIDE 
group , with the bulk of time occurring during the first 6 weeks for  screening, assessments, and class and 
booster attendance .  This  time estimate for the usual care DSME -Alone group includes: screening and 
informed consent processes (2 hours ) and three 1 -hour assessments (3 hours) . The time estimate for the 
experimental g roup also includes the (1 hour) Mind -STRIDE intervention, the 4 -week Mind -STRIDE booster 
session (30 -minutes ), home mindfulnes s practice (~24 hours) . Journaling with  each home practice session  is 
encouraged, but is optional and will depend on each individu al. Journaling can take as little as 1 minute or up 
to several minutes  (~3 hours) . Qualitative tele phone interview s will also be conducted in a subset of 25 
purposively sampled experimental group participants (40 –minutes).  
 
3.7 Data Analysis  
 
Table 5. Variables and Measures Timeline  
 
 
    
 3.7.1 General Analytic Approach fo r Aim 1:    
 
Aim  1: To compare  the effects  of the intervention  (DSME+  Mind -STRIDE)  with  those  of usual  care  (DSME -
alone)  on diabetes  distress,  diabetes  self-efficacy,  and DSM  in military  Veterans  over  time.  
 
 
Hypotheses.  From  baseline  to 24-week  post -intervention,  DSME+  Mind -STRIDE  compared  to DSME -Alone  
will:   
1. Significantly  reduce  DRD   (primary  outcome)  
2. Significantly  increase mindfulness,  diabetes  self-efficacy  and diabetes  self-management  (secondary  
behavioral  outcomes)  
3. Significantly  decrease  HbA1c  (distal  metabolic  outcome)  
 
Independent  variable:  The Mind -STRIDE  intervention , which  includes  mindfulness  stress  reduction,  
mindfulness  meditation  training  and home  practice.  
 
Dependent  variables:  The primary  outcome  on which  the analysis  is powered  is DRD measured by the PAID 
scale. Secondary outcomes include diabetes self -efficacy,  diabetes self -management , mindfulness, and glycemic 
control , measured by HbA1c.  
 
Analysis:  To assess  whether  there  are  group  differences  over  time,  we will use separate  linear  (or non-linear  
depending  on outcome)  mixed  models  for each  outcome   (diabetes  distress,  primary),  diabetes  self-efficacy,  
diabetes  self-management , mindfulness  and glycemic  control  (secondary)  for 3 time  points  (baseline,  12 weeks 
post -intervention, and 24 weeks post -intervention).  The base model will include fixed effects for treatment 
group DSME+ Mind -STRIDE, DSME -Alone group, time, and the interaction between treatment group and 
time.  To the extent possible , post -hoc analyses to explore the possible relationships between mindfulness and 
diabetes -related distress (as well as the interaction between them) on the distal secondary outcome, glycemic 
control  will be performed . 
 
Power  analysis:   Power calculations for Aim 1, hypothesis 1 of this study were based on a repeated measures 
design (2 sided α= .05) with 2 treatment groups (DSME+  Mind -STRIDE; DSME -Alone) and 3 time points 
(baseline, 12 weeks post intervention, 24 weeks post -intervention) . We computed sample size estimates that 
were powered to detect an overall treatment group difference in DRD  (PAID scale score) as well as a treatment 
group difference over time (interaction between treatment group and time). Based on our pilot work, a med ium 
effect size (d=  .6) gives a clinically meaningful change in PAID score.  Using a medium (d=.5) effect size, and 
estimates of the correlations between observations on the same subject of r=.5, powering at 80% gives a sample 
size estimate of 86 ( ~43 per group).  To account for possible clustering due to the randomization occurring in 
groups of n=5 participants, the required total sample size (86) was inflated by a factor of (1+ (5 -1) * p), where p 
is the intra -cluster correlation coefficient.78, 79 A conservative estimate of the intra -cluster correlation of  
p=0.05, gives an increased sample size of 104 ( ~52 per group).  To ensure a sample of 104 at study completion, 
126 Veterans will need to be recruited over the 2 -year study period.  This number of 126 Veterans is 
approximately 20% of the usual number of Veterans re ferred for DSME over two years and is within what is 
considered reasonable to recruit based on our pilot data. Sample size estimates were computed in Stata 
Statistical Software: Release 12 (College Station, TX: StataCorp LP;  2011).  
 
Ada Youk  PhD,  Associate  Professor  of Biostatistics  at the University  of Pittsburgh  Graduate  School  of Public  
Health,  will oversee  statistical  analysis  for Aim  1.  Analyses  for Aim  1 will be performed  using  Stata  statistical  
software.  Diabetes  distress  (the primary  outcome)  and secondary  outcomes  (mindfulness  diabetes  self-efficacy,  
diabetes  self-management , and HbA1c)  will be assessed  for normality  and appropriate  data  transformations  
will be used  if necessary . Descriptive  statistics  will be computed  to determine  central  tendency,  data  
sparseness,  and existence  of outliers  for all other  continuous  variables.  Frequency  distributions  will be 
generated  for categorical  variables  to identify  data  sparseness,  and categories  with  small  frequencies  will be 
merged  when appropriate.  In addition,  we will consider  categorization  of continuous  predictors  if the 
distributions  are skewed  or violate  assumptions  of linearity.  Differences  in covariates  by treatment  group  will 
be tested  using  chi-square  (or Fisher’s  exact)  statistics  for categorical  variables  and t-test (or Mann -Whitney)  
for continuous  variables.  Graphical  procedures  will be used  to assess  simple  change  in the outcomes  over  time.  
For the main  analyses  for Aim  1, we will test study  hypotheses  by using  linear  mixe d models  (or non-linear  

 
 
    
 mixed  models  where  appropriate),  which  account  for repeated  measures  and assess  change  over  time  (baseline,  
12 weeks,  24 weeks).  The linear  mixed  model  allows  for missing  data  if data  are missing  at random.  
Demographic  variables  with a univariate  association  with  the outcome  (p<0.10)  or differed  by treatment  group  
at baseline  (p<0.05)  will be considered  for inclusion  in a multivariate  model . Covariates  will be retained  in the 
final  multivariable  models  if significant  at p<0.05.  All tests will be two-sided.  All analyses  will be conducted  as 
intent -to-treat  analyses  and include  all patients  in the groups  to which  they  were  randomized,  regardless  of 
adherence  and/or  subsequent  withdrawal.   
 
Missing  Data.   We will review  all assessments  for completeness  during  the session  in which  it is collected  to 
attempt  to minimize  missing  data  for Aim  1. We will attempt  to assess  the missing  data  mechanism  for missing  
data  due to lost to follow -up or withdrawal.  If there  are significant  differences  in baseline  variables  between  
those  subjects  that have  complete  outcome  data  and those  that do not, we will adjust  for those  covar iates  as 
part  of the modeling.  80 If no systematic  differences  are found  or if the missing  data  is intermittent,  the 
missingness  will be handled  as part  of the regression  modeling.   Using  linear  mixed  linear  models  allows  the 
use of all available  data,  including  data  from  those  who  are missing  one or more  of the assessments.  We will 
also perform  completers  only  analyses  and see if these  differ  compared  to the modeling  using  all of the 
available  data  to assess  sensitivity  to the missingness.   
 
3.7.2 Gene ral Analytic  Approach  for Aim  2 
 
Aim  2: To identify  Veteran  satisfaction  and experiences  with  DSME  +Mind -STRIDE.  
 
We will use Convergent Parallel Design (Figure 5) to develop 
a more complete understanding of the research questions by 
obtaining different but comp lementary quantitative (Aim 1) 
and qualitative (Aim 2) data.81 Collecting and analyzing two 
independent strands of data at the same time in a single 
phase will enable us to prioritize the methods equally while 
keeping  the data analysis independent. We w ill then mix the 
results at the point of interface, loo king for convergence, 
divergence, contradictions or relationships of the two 
sources of data that will inform the overall interpretation of 
study results.   
 
Specific ally,  audio  recordings  will be made  using  digital  recording  devices  that are Federal  Information  
Processing  Standard  (FIPS)  140-2 compliant.  All interviews  will be audio -recorded  using  a VAPHS -approved  
encrypted  digital  recorder.   Audio  recordings  will be protected  per VAPHS  policy.  Trained  interviewers  will 
conduct  semi -structured  interviews  developed  specifically  to address  Qualitative -Aim  2. A standardized  
telephone  interview  guide  (Appendix  4) will ensure  sufficient  uniformity  across  the interviews  in topics  covered  
and in sequencing  to allow  comparison s. As further  interview  preparation,  we will pilot  test the interview  
guides  with  2-4 patients.  The pilot  will assist  in determining  whether  refinement  or modification  of questions  is 
needed,  allowing  us to make  necessary  revisions.82 If the interview  guides  are not significantly  modified  as a 
resul t of the pilot,  the information  gathered  from  the people  who  participated  in the pilot  will be added  to the 
information  obtained  from  participants  in the full study.   
 
The semi -structured  interview  guide  will contain  open -ended  questions  (including  clarifying  questions)  that 
also will provide  the flexibility  to explore  topics  and elicit  patient  experiences  in greater  depth —with  probing  
questions  according  to varied  patient  experiences.  Participant  interviews  will be aimed  at exploring  Vete ran 
satisfaction  and experiences  with  the Mind -STRIDE  class  provided  within  DSME.  The interview  will also 
explore  their  experience  with  mindfulness  training  and home  mindfulness  practice  in general  and relative  to 
diabetes  management .  When  possible,  DSME+  Mind -STRIDE  participants  will be asked  additional  questions  
guided  by observations  recorded  in their  journals  to enable  more  contextual  exploration  of their  mindfulness  
experience.   The interviews  will (1) provide  detailed  "thick " descriptions  about  Veter an experiences  with  Mind -
STRIDE  and mindfulness  practice  that do not rely on predefined  quantitative  study  instrument  categories,83 
and (2) provide  patients  the opportunity  to elaborate  about  moment  to moment  experiences  associated  with  
mindfulness  practice  . The interviews  will take  approximately  20-30 minutes  and will be audio -recorded  and 
transcribed  verbatim  by a trained  transcrip tionist  at the Center  for Health  Equity  Research  and Promotion   Figure 5. Convergent Parallel Design  

 
 
    
 (CHERP).  Results  of interviews  will be summarized  into topics  discussed,  as well as the range  of thematic  
issues,  concerns,  or foci of the patient.  We will also record  the frequencies  of topics  and themes  that emerge.  
Recordings  will be stored  according  to VA information  security  specifications .  
 
A sub-sample of 25 DSME+  Mind -STRIDE participants will be selected for the interviews  by purposive 
sampling with maximum variation in order to represent a wide range of age groups, race/ethnicity, and 
severity/type of diabetes.84. Verbatim transcripts from interviews with 25 DSME+ Mind -STRIDE participants 
are sufficient for thematic saturation —which requires a minimum of 12 -20 participants of each “type .” 85 The 
transcribed data will be de -identified and imported into ATLAS.ti (Scientific Software, Berlin, Germany) for 
data management and analysis.86 Two coders are standard and necessary in qualitative research to ensure 
reliability of the coding scheme.87 Dr. Rodriguez will train the coders  (existing study staff)  to develop 
qualitative codebooks for the patient interviews.  
 
Keri  Rodriguez  PhD,  Research  Health  Scientist  and CHERP  Core  Investigator  at VAPHS,  will oversee  
qualitative  data  analysis  for Aim  2.  Using a modified grounded theory approach for data analysis, t rained 
coders  will use the constant comparative method to compare newly gathered data with previously collected 
data to develop categories of responses.84  Initially, the two coders will employ an iterative process of close 
readings and discussion of a sample of interview transcripts to identify emergent concepts, categories, themes 
and relationships in the data and develop an initial set of codes to be applied to subsequent transcripts. The 
broad areas of foci will include Veteran satisfaction and exper iences of mindfulness training and practice. As 
the coders examine more transcripts, they will refine their coding sub -categories and develop a coding scheme. 
In the case of disagreements, they will further develop rules to distinguish codes. If necessary,  the coders will 
consult with the research team to refine the criteria. Both coders will then each code 100% of the transcripts 
independently.87 We will use a system of audit trails to document the creation of all codes and Kappa statistics 
will be computed to assess inter -coder agreement. The coders will meet and process any differences in coding 
for each interview  until agreement is achieved. If the two coders discussed a discrepancy and are unable to 
come to a consensus, a resolution will be reached with Dr. Rodriguez’s and the PI’s adjudication. The codes 
determined through this consensus process will be recorded  in a master file, which will become the basis for 
the final analysis. This process of coding will maintain narrative coherence with inter -coder reliability kappa 
scores > 0.75.88  
 
3.8 Timeline     
Dr. DiNardo, the Principal Investigator (PI), will be  oversee the  details of the study  including hiring and trainin g 
staff, testing the data entry system, creating study manuals, and recruiting and consenting subjects . She will  lead 
weekly meetings with the Research Team  and bi-monthly  meetings with Co -Investigators so that issues can be 
addressed in a timely manner. The Mentoring team is highly experienced in conducting clinical trials, and will 
guide the investigator in reaching charted milestones on the  timeline . See Gantt chart (Table 6) .

3.9 Study Design Considerations  
 
Several  aspects  of the study  design  warrant  consideration.  First,  the 3-year  duration  of the study  prevents  
extended  follow -up of more  than  6 months.  However,  based  on previous  research  of DSME  and mindfulness  
intervent ions,  we expect  to be able  to detect  changes  in the outcomes  specified , and the 6-month  time  period  is 
consistent  with  typical  clinical  follow -up periods.  Second,  there  is potential  for adjustment  of diabetes  
medications  during  the study  by care  providers.  To account  for this,  medication  will be tracked  and verified  in 
CPRS,  and controlled  for in the analysis.  Finally,  generalizability  is limited  due to the relatively  small  sample  
size and single  VAMC  site. However,  our site is a large  academic  medical  center  serving  a range  of diabetes  
severity  in a Veteran  population  drawn  from  urban,  suburban,  and rural  areas  in the region.  Additionally,  the 
proposed  study  includes  a qualitative  component,  for which  the purpose  is not generalizability,  but rather  
gaining  an understanding  of a phenomenon  of interest  in a specific  group  of participa nts.87 
 
Particular advantages of our study design and approach include the fact that the intervention has been pilot -
tested at VAPHS and fit  into the already existing DSME format and therefore can realistically be implemented  
without delay . Additionally, to the exten t possible , one trained diabetes educator will deliver the DSME 
component and one trained mindfulness instructor will deliver the Mind -STRIDE intervention to all groups in 
order to decrease instructor bias. In order  to sustain engagement in the study , all participants will r eceive 
monthly postcards from the research study.  Control group participants will receive postcards with healthy tips 
for living with diabetes, and experimental group participants’ postcards will  include these tips plus mindfulness 
tips and quotations.  And finally, our mixed -methods methodology will provide a more comprehensive 
evaluation of the program and inform potential implementation at other VAMCs in the future . 
 
To assure that the mindfulne ss training is delivered in a standardized way, a course manual will be developed 
and instructor guidelines will be followed . Pursuant to IRB approved authorization, all Mind -STRIDE sessions 
will be audiotaped using  a VA -approved encrypted audio -recorder . Dr. Greco,  our mindfulness expert,  will 
develop a fidelity -rating guide for the  intervention. Dr. Greco will train the Study Coordinator to use this guide 
to assess the fidelity of each audio -recorded session, so that the interventionist can be made aware of any 
discrepancies from the course manual , and they can be corrected in a timely fashion.  
 
4.0 Dissemination/Implementation  
 
Study findings will be disseminated to the following intended groups as soon as the final study report has been 
completed: Veterans, VA healthcare providers and researchers, and non -VA diabetes researchers and diabetes 
stakeholders outside of the VA.  Strat egies for disseminating findings to each group are described below with an 
estimated timeline of planned dissemination in year three of the study.  
 
4.1 Veterans  
 
Study findings will be disseminated to Veterans using the following methods:  
 a) Articles in VA newsletters, magazines, and other Veteran -related publications  
 b) Presentations at health fairs and community outreach event  
 
4.2 VA Healthcare Providers and Researchers  
 
Study findings will be disseminated to VA providers   locally, regionally, and nationally through the following 
mechanisms:  
a) Publications in peer -reviewed scientific journals (e.g., Diabetes Care, The Diabetes Educator, 
Applied Nursing Research, Journal o f Alternative and Complementary Therapies ).  
b) In -person presentations at conferences and workshops (e.g., The American Diabetes Association 
Scientific Meetings; The American Academy of Nurse Practitioner Annual Meeting; American 
Association of Diabetes E ducators Annual Meeting), The Society of Behavioral Medicine Annual 
Meeting  
 c) Webinars, teleconferences, and nursing grand rounds  
 
 
    
 d) Creation and dissemination of an educational videotape (included in the budget)

5.5 Summary  
In conclusion,  the proposed  mixed  methods  RCT  aims  to evaluate  the efficacy  of a mindfulness  intervention  
designed  to reduce  DRD  and support  diabetes  self-care  management.  The results  have  the potential  to support  
self-care  disease  management  in millions  of Veterans  with  diabetes  through  a low-cost,  non-pharmacologic  
intervention  that can be easily  incorporated  into routine  DSME.  The intervention  and study  design  are 
supported  by solid  preliminary  and pilot  data  generated  by the PI, who  is supported  by a highly  experienced,  
interdisciplinary  mentoring  team  of experts  in resource -rich VA research  and clinical  environments.  The NRI  is 
the ideal  mechanism  for support ing the PI, Dr. DiNar do’s development  as a nurse  investigator  prepared  to 
conduct  independent  research  focused  on high  priority,  VA mission -oriented  areas  of investigation.

2.0. ABSTRACT  20 
 21 
Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is a significant problem for Veterans and Active Duty personnel. 22 
Although effective treatments for PTSD exist (e.g., Prolonged Exposure, PE; Cognitive Processing 23 
Therapy; CPT) and have, at great expense, been widely disseminated by VA and DoD,  over of those 24 
30% who start treatment subsequently drop out p rior to completion . In our first preliminary study we 25 
addressed published survey data from Veterans indicating that dropout was related to logistical barriers 26 
such as travel time, cost, and stigma associated with care from mental health settings, and so ov ercame 27 
these barriers by delivering treatment via home -based  telehealth. However, dropout remained virtually 28 
unchanged . Veterans in our study who dropped out of treatment, including that delivered via home 29 
based telehealth, were interviewed and a majority responded that they would (a) consider returning to 30 
treatment and (b) would be more likely to complete treatment if a peer who had themselves successfully 31 
completed treatment were available to help them with exposure homework . In keeping with this 32 
feedback , our second preliminary study examined the feasibility of using peers to (a) encourage 33 
Veterans who had dropped out of PE to return to treatment and (b) offer support during in vivo (real 34 
world) exposure therapy homework assignments (e.g., as they would d uring ‘gym workouts’). 35 
Preliminary findings indicate tha t such an approach is feasible, and potentially effective, in that over 36 
50% of dropouts from PE agreed to return to treatment and 30% of these actually did so immediately.  37 
We will evaluate whether the  opportunity to receive social support during  in vivo exposure therapy 38 
homework  from Veterans who themselves have successfully competed  PE (i.e., the therapeutic 39 
equivalent of an exposure therapy ‘workout buddy’) is effective in reversing  dropout and improving  40 
PTSD  outcomes; and, secondarily, to determine whether this program is particularly helpful for those 41 
receiving PE via telemedicine.  42

 This study seeks to address the problem of dropou t from evidence -based treatment for PTSD. We will 47 
evaluate whether the opportunity to receive social support during  in vivo exposure therapy assignments 48 
from Veterans who themselves have successfully competed  PE (i.e., the therapeutic equivalent of an 49 
exposure therapy ‘workout buddy’) is effective in reversing  dropout and improving  PTSD  outcomes. 50 
To achieve this objective, we will use a between  group, randomized controlled repeated measures 51 
design comparing PE+Exposure Workout Buddy  vs. PE+Peer General Support (i.e., the standard VA 52 
Peer Support program methods involving a peer who does NOT engage in any support during in vivo  53 
homework ) to evaluate the ‘PE+Exposure Workout B uddy’ adjunctive therapy component in terms of 54 
its ability to increase likelihood that Veterans will (a) return to  and complete  treatment & (b) evince 55 
reduced PTSD  symptomatology  at post -treatment and 3 - & 6-month fol low-up. An exploratory objective 56 
is to determine whether the hypothesized differential advantage of the workout buddy program is more 57 
pronounced for Veterans who receive PE via telehealth vs . receiving PE in person, as data from 58 
Preliminary Study #1 indica te that this may be the case.  59 
 60 
Objective 1a. To determine relative differences in treatment dose  obtained, measured in terms 61 
of the number of sessions completed upon return to treatment, in response to ‘PE+Exposure 62 
Workout Buddy’ vs. ‘ PE+Peer General Supp ort’ in individuals who have previously dropped out 63 
of evidence based treatment for PTSD.  64 
 65 
Hypothesis 1a.  Treatmen t ‘dose’, measured in terms of number of sessions completed post 66 
randomization, will be greater for participants in the PE+Exposure Workout Buddy condition 67 
compared to PE+Peer General Support .  68 
 69 
Objective 1b. (Exploratory) To determine if differences are a mplified or diminished with respect 70 
to prior identified risk factors such as age, race, gender, substance use, or social support.   71 
 72 
Hypothesis 1b.  This enhanced dose/adherence will be observed for the PE+Exposure  Workout 73 
Buddy condition within each risk factor previously associated with dropout (i.e., age, race, 74 
gender, and substance use).  75 
 76 
Objective 2a. To determine differential effectiveness, measured in terms of therapeutic gains 77 
over time on measures of PTSD s ymptomatology, of ‘PE+Exposure Workout Buddy’ vs. 78 
‘PE+Peer General Support’   with therapy dropouts in (i.e., ‘treatment outcome’).  79 
 80 
Hypothesis 2a.  Treatment ‘outcome’, measured in terms of PTSD symptom reduction scores, 81 
will be significantly more improved for participants in the PE+Exposure Workout Buddy relative 82 
to PE+Peer General Support  condition at each asse ssment point (post treatment, 3 -month and 83 
6-month follow -up). 84 
 85 
Objective 2b.  (Exploratory) To determine if differences are amplified or diminished with respect 86 
to race, gender, age, substance use, or social support.  87 
 88 
Hypothesis 2b.  Relatively greater gains in the PE+Exposure Workout Buddy cond ition will be 89 
observed across race, gender, and age groups at post treatment, 3 -month and 6 -month follow - 90 
up. Self reported levels of social support will mediate gains.  91

 Objective 3. (Exploratory) To determine the presence of an initial signal of differential dose and 93 
effectiveness of ‘PE+Exposure Workout Buddy’ when delivered in traditional in person (face to 94 
face) vs. telehealth formats. (Note, the parameters by which this objective will be achieved are 95 
naturalistic insofar as this variable is no t subject to randomization because participants who had 96 
received telehealth PE (about half of our clinic population) or in person PE prior to dropout (and thus 97 
prior to this study) will continue to receive treatment in the same  modality upon randomization to either 98 
condition).  99

4.0. MILITARY RELEVANCE  102 
 103 
Maintaining force strength is of paramount importance during times of conflict. Up to 24% of OEF/OIF 104 
Veterans meet criteria for PTSD and 35% report significant PTSD symptoms. These disorders manifest 105 
while t hese individuals are still DoD service members, and as such, current characteristics of combat, 106 
and subsequent shortcomings in current treatments for PTSD, particularly with respect to treatment 107 
retention, significantly affect force strength. Our best trea tments can return personnel to nearly pre - 108 
trauma performance at about 65 -75% effectiveness. A large proportion of those who fail to respond to 109 
treatment do so not because treatment was ineffective, but because they were unable or unwilling to 110 
complete trea tment. That is, they dropped out of treatment prior to completion. If the present 111 
intervention, which builds upon the teamwork and leadership skills implicit in military training, is effective 112 
in retaining individuals in treatment who otherwise would drop out, then we may well be able to 113 
dramatically cut the dropout rate from our most effective class of treatments, and thus significantly 114 
enhance our ability to sustain force strength.  115 
 116 
Moreover, from the perspective of future costs in terms of human sufferi ng and mental health care, 117 
effective intervention is key. This is because PTSD does not seem to remit over time, and each year 118 
that effective intervention is delayed is characterized by functional impairment, depression, and 119 
increased health care costs to the Veteran, the DoD and the VA . These improvements to dropout 120 
prevention from evidence based  therapy for PTSD, in addition to reducing effects of untreated PTSD, 121 
will contribute directly to the health and well being of service members, enhancing mission readiness 122 
and preventing unnecessary force depletion and care expenses. As such, military sign ificance of this 123 
project is great, both in terms of directly enhancing force readiness, as well as reducing economic and 124 
human suffering costs borne by the DoD and its members.  125 
 126 
 127 
5.0. BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE  128 
 129 
We will evaluate whether the opportunity to receive social support during  in vivo exposure therapy 130 
homework from Veterans who themselves have successfully competed  Prolonged Exposure (PE) (i.e., 131 
the therapeutic equivalent of an exposure therapy ‘workout buddy’) i s effective in (a) reversing PE 132 
dropout and (b) improving PTSD  outcomes in a sample of Veterans who have previously dropped out 133 
of PE. This will be accomplished by comparing ‘PE+Exposure Workout Buddy ’ to ‘PE+Peer General 134 
Support ’ who does NOT engage in any support during in vivo homework , the treatment typically offered 135 
Veterans who drop out from evidence based PTSD care, in a Randomized Controlled Trial.  136

 • Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is a significant problem for Veterans  and Active Duty 138 
personnel.  139 
• Effective Treat ments (e.g., Prolonged Exposure, PE; Cognitive Processing Therapy, CPT) exist and 140 
have, at great expense, been disseminated by the Departments of Veterans Affairs (VA) and 141 
Defense (DoD).  142 
• Despite treatment effectiv eness, over 30% of those who are identified, referred, and successfully 143 
access evidence based psychotherapy for PTSD treatment drop out prematurely.  144 
• In a prior DoD study we addressed findings that dropout is related to logistical barriers such as travel 145 
time, cost, and stigma associated with care from clinic -based settings by delivering treatment via 146 
home telehealth. However, dropout remained virtually unchanged at 26%.  147 
• In Preliminary Study #1, Veterans who dropped out of treatment, including that delivered  via home 148 
telehealth, were surveyed and half responded in the affirmative to a statement that they would have 149 
had a better likelihood of completing treatment if a peer who had completed treatment were available 150 
to help them with exposure homework. In Preli minary Study #2, 52% of a clinic sample of Veterans 151 
who dropped out of PE indicated that they “would be interested in trying exposure therapy for PTSD 152 
a second time if they could do so with the assistance of an exposure workout buddy.”  153 
• To serve these drop outs from PE therapy, we developed and began initial feasibility testing of the 154 
‘PE+Exposure Workout Buddy ’ program in which Veterans who have recently completed PE and 155 
no longer meet criteria for the disorder meet patients at exposure sites in the communi ty to offer 156 
support during exposure.  157 
• The present study  is to use a randomized controlled repeated measures design to test the 158 
hypotheses that the in vivo ‘exposure workout buddy’ adjunctive component to PE will increase the 159 
likelihood that Veterans who hav e dropped out of PE will (a) return and complete treatment and (b) 160 
evince reduced PTSD symptomatology relative to a general support peer . 161

Preliminary Studies:  163 
 164 
Preliminary Study #1 : Dropout from Exposure 165 
Therapy for PTSD in Telehealth Vs. In Person 166 
Treatment  (See Hernandez -Tejada et al. , 2014 for  167 
a full description of Preliminary Study 1).   168 
 169 
All participants met DSM -IV criteria for PTSD. Of 170 
the 258 participants in our DoD study who were 171 
randomized to either telehealth or in person 172 
conditions and rece ived at least one exposure 173 
therapy treatment session, 69 (26.5%) withdrew 174 
from treatment. All were male, 27.7% were 175 
Vietnam Veterans, 27.7% Persian Gulf Veterans, 176 
and 44.7% were OEF/OIF Veterans, with no 177 
significant differences in theatre in terms of 178 
treatment medium. Surprisingly, rate of dropout from telehealth (28.7%, n = 35) was not significantly 179 
different from that of in person treatment (25.0%, n = 34) (χ2=0.45, p = 0.30). Forty -seven of the 69 180 
(68.1%) treatment dropouts (27 telehealth; 20 in person) agreed to provide data regarding reasons for 181 
dropping out of treatment. Age ranged from 21 -70 years, and there were no significant differences in 182 
terms of age, education, employment, marital status or baseline symptom severity between conditions.  183

 Results: Considering travel logistics and their relationship to dropout, ANOVA indicated a significant 185 
(and entirely expected) difference between in person and telehealth participants, with in person 186 
participants reporting more problems with bad weather, p arking, transportation, and work/family 187 
obligations (  = 22.5) compared to telehealth (  = 19.6) ( F(1,45) = 5.20, p = 0.027). No other significant 188 
differences were noted for any other factor, including Treatment Demands (in person  = 16.2, vs. 189 
telehealth = 15.6; F(1,45) = 0.34, p = .560); Perceived Relevance of Treatment (in person  = 20.9, 190 
vs. telehealth  = 20.7; F(1,45) = 0.01, p = 0.906), or Relationship with Therapist (in person  = 9.1; 191 
telehealth  = 9.0; F(1,45) = 0.04, p = 0.847). However, when Veterans who dropped out of exposure 192 
based treatment were asked specifically about their experiences during imaginal and in vivo exposure 193 
homework, differences between in person and telehealth groups did emerge, and both groups reported 194 
significant difficu lty, particularly with in vivo exposure trials.  Specifically, while only 20% of in person 195 
and 31% of telehealth based treatment dropouts reported they “could not tolerate thinking about the 196 
trauma”, 40% of in person and 58% of telehealth treatment dropouts  reported they “could not tolerate 197 
assignments to go out in public.” Moreover, 20% of in person but 41% of telehealth based Veterans 198 
reported that they “worried about losing control during exposures.” (See graphical illustration of these 199 
data.)  Overall, t hese preliminary data suggest that dropouts had problems with in vivo/situational 200 
exposure homework, and that participants in the telehealth condition who dropped out of treatment 201 
were having more difficulty with specific aspects of exposure therapy compar ed to those receiving 202 
exposure therapy in person.  Along these lines, Hernandez -Tejada, et al (2014) noted that when treating 203 
PTSD in general, and particularly when offering exposure based treatments via telehealth, 204 
interpersonal support offered during expo sure trials by other Veterans could be helpful. Actually, this 205 
“exposure homework workout buddy” idea was not so much our own as it was a direct and repeated 206 
approach suggested by the Veterans who had dropped out of treatment  and who were interviewed 207 
regar ding their reasons for doing so. Specifically, when we contacted aforementioned Veterans, 208 
approximately 50% indicated that they would have been likely to remain in treatment had they the 209 
support of another Veteran during in vivo exposure homework (see Prel iminary Study #2) . While novel 210 
in its application to PTSD treatment, peer assistance is a technique currently used successfully by other 211 
health and mental health specialties (e.g., cancer : see Meyer et al., 2015; serious mental illness : see 212 
Corrigan et al. , 2014)).  213 
 214 
Preliminary Study #2 : Offering Treatment Dropouts a Chance to Return to PE Treatment with an 215 
Exposure Therapy Workout Buddy: Feasibility of Recruitment of Patients and Peers  216 
 217 
The Veterans’ suggestion to combine the beneficial aspects of social support with the effectiveness of 218 
exposure based treatments for PTSD (e.g., one Veteran described it as ‘the best of supportive group 219 
counseling with the best of PTSD treatment’) represen ted no less than a “Eureka” moment for our 220 
research team, insofar as we recognized that combining peer support with exposure therapy might 221 
directly impact, in a cost effective manner, the treatment retention issue confronting patients of VA and 222 
DoD. Indeed , variations on this theme are evident in-group  delivery of exposure therapy for PTSD (see 223 
Smith, Porter, Messina, Beyer, Defever, Foa, & Rauch, 2015). Our approach to leveraging peer support 224 
is directly in line with the recent VA/DoD implementation of “Pe er Support Programs” (Money et al., 225 
2011) across the country. We predict that this support will help to address dropout associated with 226 
exposure therapy, particularly when delivered via telehealth, an increasingly prevalent modality in 227 
VA/DoD.  228 
 229 
Toward thi s end, we developed the ‘ PE+Exposure Workout Buddy’  program, explained at length in the 230 
Treatments  section below. It is important to note that Veterans serving as ‘workout buddies’ are not 231

 replacing therapists or performing therapy; rather they are simply providing support and encouragement 232 
akin to that derived from others during group psychotherapy, such as during group delivered PE (Smith 233 
et al., 2015). PE Workout buddies are Veterans who have completed PE and no longer meet criteria 234 
for the disorder, and  who have volunteered to meet Veterans engaged in PE (in this case, Veterans 235 
who have dropped out of PE, but returned at the offer of a PE workout buddy) at their situational 236 
exposure homework site to offer encouragement and support in addressing a previou sly discussed and 237 
agreed upon exposure hierarchy item. Our preliminary qualitative interviews with Veterans in this 238 
program indicate that this enhances PE treatment in two ways: first, Veterans appear more likely to 239 
attempt  in vivo exercises if they know a  fellow Veteran is waiting at the site of their exposure homework 240 
(i.e., when they ‘don’t feel like’ doing the exposure homework, they are nonetheless more likely to leave 241 
their house and drive to Wal -Mart for the exposure assignment if they know the Worko ut Buddy is there 242 
waiting). Second, they are more likely to complete  the exposure homework item if they have the 243 
encouragement and support of another Veteran during the process.  244 
 245 
For this preliminary feasibility study, we re -contacted 82 Veterans who had dropped out of exposure 246 
based treatment for PTSD (either from two ongoing treatment outcome studies or from VA PTSD clinic 247 
services) and offered them the opportunity to attempt PE again, this time with the assistance of an 248 
‘exposure therapy workout buddy’. We also asked clinicians to contact individuals who had successfully 249 
completed treatment and no longer met criteria for PTSD who might be interested in serving as a PE 250 
Workout Buddy.  251 
 252 
Feasibility Results : Fully 52% (n=43) of  the 82 dropouts indicated that they “would be interested in 253 
trying exposure therapy for PTSD a second time if they could do so with the assistance of an exposure 254 
workout buddy,”  and 30% (13) of these immediately  completed informed consent to re -initate tr eatment. 255 
Given the strong support from Veterans who had dropped o ut of treatment for the  peer support solution, 256 
we next attempted to identify peers who might be good candidates to serve in this capacity (e.g., offer 257 
to meet patients at in vivo homework locations to offer support and encouragement). Thirteen potential 258 
exposure therapy workout buddi es were contacted, 85% (11) agreed to enroll in the program as a 259 
volunteer, and 8 have completed the brief training, indicating that recruitment of peers does not appear 260 
problematic. Note each peer agreed to accompany up t o 4 different patients over a 6 -month period, 261 
and the future dissemination potential of the program from the perspective of Veterans volunteering to 262 
help other Veterans appears strong.  263 
 264 
As noted above, 13 Veterans who dropped out of treatment agreed to return to PE with an exposure 265 
workout  buddy and 12 have contributed baseline pilot study data. Two Veterans have already 266 
completed PE treatment with the social support assistance of a workout buddy and the remaining 11 267 
are in the process of treatment, engaging in standard PE with their therap ist, and meeting peers in the 268 
community to complete in vivo exposure therapy assignments. We polled participants (both those who 269 
had completed the PE+Workout Buddy program, and those who were in the midst of treatment) as to 270 
their satisfaction and general experiences. 100% reported that they were either “very satisfied” or 271 
“extremely satisfied with the program. All participants reported that they would strongly recommend the 272 
program to a friend. 100% of participants agreed with the statement that “the peer was dependable,” 273 
and 100% indicated in the affirmative to the statement  “the peer addressed important issues in their 274 
health care.” Zero adverse events were reported, by patients, peers, or therapists. Thus, the feasibility 275 
of the program, measured in term s of the successful resolution of the logistics of peer recruitment, peer 276 
training, peer and patient coordination with each other and with the therapist for in vivo exposure 277 
therapy homework assignment meetings, and most importantly, patient willingness to  return to 278 
treatment (52%), overall appears very strongly supported . 279

6.0. RESEARCH DESIGN  282 
 283 
Using a 2 -arm, randomized controlled trial with repeated 284 
measures at baseli ne, post treatment, and 3 - & 6-month 285 
follow -up we will compare PE+Peer  General Support  to 286 
PE+Exposure  Workout Buddy intervention, in which peers 287 
who have successfully completed PE PTSD treatment and 288 
no longer meet PTSD symptom criteria are paired with 289 
Veterans who have recently dropped out of treatment to 290 
help the latter com plete exposure homework assignments 291 
to determine if this pairing affects the following 2 primary 292 
endpoints: (1) treatment dose/completion  and (2) treatment 293 
outcome . Exploratory aims are to determine if the program 294 
results in (3) differential treatment completion and 295 
outcomes for telehealth vs . in person -delivered PE 296 
treatment, as preliminary data indicate that the exposure 297 
workout buddy adjunctive component may be more 298 
relevant t o Veterans receiving PE via telehealth, a 299 
treatment delivery format of increasing prevalence in VA 300 
and DoD settings. See Logic Model Diagram for study 301 
design illustration.  NOTE : (a) whereas telehealth delivered 302 
psychotherapy involves a therapist at one sit e and a patient at a second, all exposure workout buddies 303 
will be located near patients and workout buddy interactions with participants take place in person, in 304 
the community (b) Peers will NOT be conducting any therapy or substituting for the therapist, 305 
who will continue to deliver treatment . Rather, workout buddies  will simply be meeting patients at 306 
community exposure assignment sites such as the parking lot of Wal -Mart, & accompanying them 307 
during exposure, which  typically simply involves staying in a location until anxiety subsides . General 308 
support peers  follow the VA standard Peer Support model and roles. General support peers  make 309 
telephone contact with Veterans, and  meet with them informally in person when Veterans arrive for 310 
their appointments.  They  will remind and encourage participants to attend appointments, check up on 311 
them once  per week via telephone and ask about current treatment progress, life stresses, 312 
opportunities, problems and successes, and offer general support  and advice  regarding  VA programs . 313 
 314 
Veterans (participants and peers) with PTSD will be re cruited from the Charleston VA Medical C enter 315 
catchment area. Participants will have been assigned to exp osure therapy for PTSD and either started 316 
treatment, or dropped out before treatment ; peers will have successfully completed exposure therapy 317 
for PTSD . Note, Charleston VA Medical Center treatment providers for PTSD all offer both in person 318 
and telemedicine based treatment, and equal numbers of patients in both treatme nt modalities will be 319 
enrolled (approximately 10 and 10) . Those eligible to participate will also include Veterans who are 320 
identified as “at -risk” of dropping out, Veterans who are uncomfortable completing in vivo exposure 321 
activities, and those who may have PTSD symptoms, but at the sub -threshold level . Participants will 322 
receive 8-12 weekly sessions of exposure therapy  treatment with assistance of a PE Peer , who will 323 
meet them at lea st once per week for in vivo exposure therapy assignments, for 3 -4 weeks at the 324 
beginning of treatment . All participants and peers will be consented . Participants will be assessed at 325

 baseline, post -treatment,  and 3- & 6-month  follow -up. Participants who demonstrate clinically significant 326 
and ad equate gains prior to the 8 th session will be eligible for early termination if they achieve a 24 - 327 
point reduction from baseline PCL on two consecutive measurements. This criterion has been 328 
establishe d in prior exposure therapy  trials to guard against the potential of misclassifying early 329 
responders as treatment dropouts.  330

Peer Selection.  Therapists will be asked if they have any patients who have completed treatment and 332 
did very well, both overall and  with in vivo exposure therapy components. Therapists are directed to 333 
contact these patients, inform them about the peer program, and ask them if they would like Dr. Acierno, 334 
a VA clinician and researcher, to discuss the program further, outline the nature  of expectations, 335 
including confidentiality, and research characteristics, and schedule a 2 hour training. Thus, initial 336 
nominations for the program are based on therapist impressions of successful candidates AFTER they 337 
have completed treatment. As such, t he therapists know candidates’ strengths. Peers, who undergo 338 
training and subsequently indicate their willingness to serve as a peer will have their names added to 339 
our database, which is housed on a secure VA server.  Note, peers will be trained that confi dentiality 340 
is key, and we will explain confidentiality in the same way as is expected when individuals participate 341 
in supportive group therapy. That is, this is a supportive intervention of peers as is found in supportive 342 
group  therapy, with which Veterans  are very familiar,  and that all discussions held during such 343 
interactions are confidential, as is all information, including identifying information, learned about 344 
another participant, through  participating in this project.   345

7.1. Selection of Subjects  349 
 350 
7.1.1. Subject Populations. Participants wil l be 10 0 Veterans of OEF, OIF, OND, Persian Gulf , or 351 
Vietnam conflicts with PTSD ; peers will be 50 Veterans from the same conflicts . As the Charleston VA 352 
also serves Active Duty personnel,  a small proportion of participants will be from this subgroup.  353 
Participants will be male or female, aged 18 years and above, who have dropped out of evidence based 354 
treatment for PTSD (PE) after completing 1 -7 sessions and who still have PTSD  (in the liter ature on 355 
PE, the first session is sometimes session 0, during which treatment components, including exposure, 356 
are explained. A significant proportion of dropout occurs at this point, and thus we intend to include 357 
these individuals as participants to mainta in relevance of study findings).  358 
 359 
7.1.2. Source of Research Material.  Self-report scales, session attendance data, and interviews will 360 
be used to evaluate clinical and process outcome at pre -treatment, immediate post -treatment, 3 -month,  361 
and 6 -month follow -up; with the exception of session attendance, process outcomes will be evaluated 362 
at post -treatment and 3 - & 6-months. These timeframes have been selected because they correspond 363 
to assessment structures of prior studies of PTSD, and bec ause they represent critical timing points for 364 
the diagnosis. In pilot testing of the assessment battery, 95 minutes was the average time of completion; 365 
however, all participants will nevertheless be informed that the assessment will require approximately 366 
2 hours and will be allowed to take a break from assessment at the approximate 30 -minute point. All 367 
assessments will be audiotaped and study personnel will listen to a randomly selected 20% to ensure 368 
reliability over the course of the study . 369

 In addition to these regular battery -based comprehensive assessments, the PCL -5 and Patient Health 371 
Questionnaire will be repeated every week, before the session  begins , to allow a more in -depth 372 
evaluation of the longitudinal trajectory of PTSD symptom seve rity over the active treatment period . 373 
Moreover, in instances of premature study exit, participants will be asked to complete a PCL -5 and 374 
Patient Health Questionnaire at that point in time in order to obtai n more valid exit point data. As in our 375 
prior stud ies, the more complete PCL -5 trajectory will be used to facilitate multiple imputation of missing 376 
data for treatment dropouts for related outcomes.  377 
 378 
Clinical Outcomes . The following interview and self -report measures have been widely used in the 379 
clinical evaluation of adults with PTSD, and will be used in the present study. They will be collected at 380 
baseline, post -treatment, and 3 - & 6-month  follow -ups. The PCL -5 and Patient Health Questionnaire 381 
are also collected every  other  week during treatment.  382 
 383 
1. Clinician Administered PTSD Scale -5 (CAPS -5; Weathers et al., 2013): PTSD diagnoses will be 384 
ascertained using the CAPS -5, considered the gold standard in PTSD assessment. The CAPS 385 
is a 30 -item, structured interview that corresponds  to the DSM -5 criteria for PTSD. For each 386 
diagnostic item, standardized questions and probes are provided. Questions focus on symptom 387 
presence, the onset and duration of symptoms, subjective distress, impact of symptoms on 388 
socia l and occupational functioni ng and improvement in symptoms.  389 
2. Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview 7.0  (MINI 7.0): The MINI is a standardized 390 
structured interview used to assess psychiatric diagnoses according to the DSM -5. The MINI is 391 
similar in sensitivity, specificity, and  inter-rater reliability to more lengthy diagnostic interviews, 392 
such as the SCID (Sheehan et al., 1998). Major Depression, Panic, and Substance Dependence 393 
diagnoses will be evaluated via this structured interview.  394 
3. PTSD  Checklist -5 (PCL -5; Blevins, Weather s et al., 2015):   The PCL -5 is a new version of the 395 
PCL, among the most commonly used self report measures of PTSD symptoms and intensity. 396 
The PCL -5 is structured to correspond to the DSM -5 PTSD criteria. The 20 -items are scored on 397 
a 0-4 Likert scale for e ach symptom corresponding to “Not at all” to “Extremely”. Total scores 398 
range from 0 to 80 . Initial psychometric data are encouraging. With college student samples, 399 
Blevin et al found PCL -5 scores exhibited strong internal consistency (α = .94), test -retest  400 
reliability ( r = .82), and convergent ( rs = .74 to .85) and discriminant ( rs = .31 to .60) validity. With 401 
Veteran samples, Bovin et al (2015) found that the PCL -5 had good internal consistency (α =.96) 402 
and test -retest reliability (r = .84). Moreover, signal detection analyses using CAPS -5 indicated 403 
a cutoff score of 31 -33 on the PCL -5 optimally categorized PTSD diagnosis.  404 
4. Selected scales of the Deployment Risk and Resiliency Inventory  (DRRI; King, King, & Vogt, 405 
2003). The DRRI is collection of self -report measures assessing 14 key deployment -related risk 406 
and resilience factors with demonstrated implications for Veterans' long -term health.  407 
5. Patient Health Questionnaire -9 (PHQ -9; Kroenke, Spitzer, & Williams, 2001): The Patient Health 408 
Questionnaire -9 is widely used, well -validated measure of depression severity with high internal 409 
consistency (alpha .83 to .92; Cameron, Crawford, et al, 2008), and is correlated strongly with 410 
other depression measures (Kroenke et al., 2001). Its 9 items assess affective and somatic 411 
symptoms and correspond to diagnostic criteria for MDD.  412 
6. Veterans RAND 12 -Item Health Survey (VR-12; Kazis, 2000, 2004) .  The VR -12 is a valid and 413 
reliable instrument to measure quality of life and/or functional status in vetera ns. It will be used 414 
to track changes in general mental and physical health functioning (i.e., functional status or 415 
general health functioning ). 416

 7. Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index  (PSQI; Buysse, Reynolds, Monk, Berman & Kupfer, 1989) : The 417 
PSQI assesses the qual ity and patterns of sleep. It differentiates “poor” from “good” sleep by 418 
measuring seven domains: subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep 419 
efficiency, sleep disturbances, use of sleep medication, and daytime dysfunction over the last 420 
month.  421 
8. Brief Inventory of Psychosocial Functioning (B -IPF; Marx et al., 2013).  The Brief Inventory of 422 
Psychosocial Functioning (Marx et al. 2013) is a 7 -item self -report instrument measuring 423 
respondents’ level of functioning in seven life domains:  romantic relationship, relationship with 424 
children, family relationships, friendships and socializing, work, training and education, and 425 
activities of daily living. Respondents indicate the degree to which they had trouble in the last 30 426 
days in each area on a 7 -point scale ranging from “0 = Not at all” to “6 = Very much.”  427 
 428 
Additional Co -variables.  In addition to demographic and baseline levels of the clinical outcome variables 429 
that will serve as adjustment co -variables and putative effect modification variables in proposed 430 
analyses, we will assess the level of combat exposure of participants at baseline using the Combat 431 
Exposure Scale  (CES; Keane, Fairbank, Caddell, Zimering, Taylor, & Mora, 1989) because comba t 432 
exposure intensity has been related to treatment response in past studies, including our own (see Price, 433 
Gros, Strachan, Ruggiero, & Acierno, 2013). The CES is a 7 -item self -report measure that assesses 434 
wartime stressors experienced by combatants. Items are rated on a 5 -point frequency (1 = no or never 435 
to 5 = more than 50 times), 5 -point duration (1 = never to 5 = more than 6 months), 4 -point frequency 436 
(1 = no to 4 = more than 12 times) or 4 -point degree of loss (1 = no one to 4 = more than 50%) scale. 437 
Respondents are asked to respond based on their exposure to various combat situations, such as firing 438 
rounds at the enemy and being on dangerous duty. The total CES score (ranging from 0 to 41) is 439 
calculated by using a sum of weighted scores, which can be cl assified into 1 of 5 categories of combat 440 
exposure ranging from "light" to "heavy."   Futher,  we will administer the Alcohol Use Disorders 441 
Identification Test  (AUDIT; Saunders et al., 1993), a 10 -item screening questionnaire with three 442 
questions on the amou nt and frequency of drinking, 3 questions about alcohol dependence, and 4 443 
questions about problems caused by alcohol.  The Drug Abuse Screening Test  (DAST -10; Skinner, 444 
1982) will also be administered to all participants.  The instrument contains 10 items t hat serve as a 445 
brief clinical screening and treatment evaluation for substance use.  The DAST -10 items are structure 446 
in a “yes/no” format.   Staff will gather a prior treatment history at baseline  via the “Previous PTSD 447 
Treatment Information” measure, an el even -item questionnaire detailing previous treatment history in 448 
the VA. Finally, current treatment will be assessed using t he “Existing Treatment ” questionnaire , which  449 
queries about current participation in research studies, treatment received, and medicat ion information.    450 
 451 
Process Outcomes . During data collection of clinical outcomes, we will also examine the following 452 
measures immediately post -treatment, and at 3 - & 6-month follow -up (only treatment credibility will be 453 
assessed at mid-treatment, after treatment has bee n explained):   454 
 455 
1. Session Attendance, Session Frequency Limits, Definition of Treatment Completion, and Study 456 
Attrition  This is, of course, a primary ou tcome variable related to AIM 1a and 1b of this study, 457 
and examines impact of the exposure workout buddy program on ‘treatment dose’ delivered, 458 
measured both in terms of total new treatment sessions attended and % completing treatment 459 
in each group. To thi s end, we will keep careful records of session attendance and study dropout . 460 
A treatment dropout will be defined as any patient who does not complete a total of at least 10 461 
new sessions of treatment OR who leaves treatment prior to a reduction of PCL -5 Sco res below 462 
Version:  05/07/20  (Amendment 13) 
Peer Social Support During In Vivo Exposure for PTSD: A Program to Address Dropout from Prolonged Exposure  
 
 
 
 Page 11 of 36 
 the clinical cutoff posted by the VA National Center for PTSD of 33 obtained in two consecutive 463 
PCL-5 scores. A treatment completer will be defined as completing 10 or more sessions; or when 464 
no additional treatment is needed due to treatment gain s, two consecutive PCL -5 scores below 465 
33 will reflect these gains . The overall limit to number of sessions in either group will be 15 (so 466 
as to prevent outliers in session frequency affecting ‘dose’ between group analyses). It is 467 
expected that most patient s will occasionally miss a session or fail to complete their homework 468 
assignments . These will not be considered dropouts; patients will be allowed to make -up 469 
sessions as long as they re -enter treatment within a 4 week period. Patients who miss all 4- 470 
treatm ent sessions during a 4 -week period will be considered dropouts (i.e., if a patient, during 471 
treatment, does not attend the next session within 4 weeks of the last session completed, they 472 
will be considered a dropout). Note MEASUREMENT ISSUE: participants w ho completed a 473 
greater number of sessions prior to original dropout may be expected to achieve clinical outcome 474 
goals in fewer sessions than those completing one or two sessions prior to dropout. Hence, the 475 
‘dose’ variable of Aim 1a and b, measured in term s of overall number of new sessions, is 476 
confounded by ‘prior dose’, or the number of treatment sessions received prior to study initiation. 477 
Therefore, in addition to number of new sessions completed, we will also assess number of 478 
treatment completions, mea sured in terms of completing at least 10 sessions or achieving 479 
clinical gains on the PCL -5 reflected by scores below 33 on two consecutive PCL -5 480 
measurements as specified above . 481 
2. Treatment Credibility  (Peers after 1st patient experience; Participants prior to session 2 ) To 482 
assess differences in outcome expectancy, treatment credibility scales developed by Borkovec 483 
and Nau (1972) will be used. Four of the questions will be used for this study, with 10 -point Likert 484 
scales. These include questi ons regarding how logical treatment seems, how confident they are 485 
about treatment, and expectations of success .  486 
3. Treatment Adherence  Treatments in both groups will require patients to carry out “homework 487 
assignments.” These forms will be collected and moni tored each week during treatment. The 488 
percentage of returned, completed forms will be computed as an indicator of adherence to 489 
homework assignments .  490 
4. Modified Charleston Psychiatric Outpatient Satisfaction Scale  (CPOSS -VA; Frueh et al., 2002):  491 
(Patient , following their last treatment session ) Patient satisfaction is an important treatment 492 
outcome variable, closely associated with clinical outcomes (Druss et al., 1999). This measure 493 
also asks about specific components of the workout buddy program (e.g., the quality of 494 
communication, ease of use, willingness to use treatment) in order to allow in depth analysis of 495 
potential causes of differences in workout buddy effectiveness for in person vs. telehealth 496 
delivered PE (AIM 3). The CPOSS -VA is 16 -item measure, with a Likert scale response format, 497 
based on a general measure of patient satisfaction (Pellegrin et al., 2001). In a sample of 498 
Veterans preliminary data showed excellent reliability (alpha = .96) and good convergent validity 499 
with anchors (Frueh  et al., 2002).  500 
5. Barriers to Therapy Scale (Modified)  Assesses logistic, interpersonal and anxiety based barriers.  501 
6. COVID -19 Research Therapy Impact Scale ; Ten item questionnaire which assesses the impact 502 
of the COVID -19 pandemic on research participation an d daily life.  503 
 504 
Preliminary Economic Outcomes . Workout -buddy Related Capital Costs : Incremental costs of the 505 
intervention relative to the comparator are the relevant costs for decision making, thus preliminary 506 
estimates for this new program will be obtained here. These costs primarily include workout buddy 507 
training time and materials, a nd extra therapist time required to coordinate exposure hierarchy logistics 508 
Version:  05/07/20  (Amendment 13)

 for initial meetings, as well as therapist time to collect feedback regarding exposure trials from peers in 509 
between sessions.  510 
 511 
7.1.3 . Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria. Participants  will be 10 0 Veterans of OEF, OIF, OND, Persian 512 
Gulf, or Vietnam conflicts with PTSD ; peers will be 50 Veterans from the same conflicts . Participants 513 
will be male or female, aged 18 years and above, who have dropped out of evidence based treatment 514 
for PTSD  (PE) after completing 1 -7 sessions and who still have PTSD (in the literature on PE, the first 515 
session is sometimes session 0, during which treatment components, including exposure, are 516 
explained. A significant proportion of dropout occurs at this point, and thus we intend to include these 517 
individuals as participants to maintain relevance of study findings).   Participants who are considered 518 
“at risk” of dropping out will also be included; this is defined as having failed to complete 3 sessions of 519 
exposure therapy within any 6 -week period , verbally indicating major anxiety about exposure activities , 520 
and/or populations identified at higher risk of dropping out of exposure therapy.  521 
 522 
Actively psychotic or demented persons  and individuals with both suicidal ideation and clear intent  will 523 
be excluded; however , to maximize generalization of results, other forms of psychopathology will not 524 
be a basis for exclusion.  All structured interviews will be audiotaped to calculate inter -rater reliability on 525 
a randomly selected 20%. Based on clinic data and data from our two prior DoD/VA PE treatment 526 
outcome studies, we will have satisfactory minority representation: 35 -50% African American, 8 -10% 527 
Hispanic, and 4 -6% Asian American; 10% are e xpected to be women.  528 
 529 
Participant Eligibility Criteria . Study inclusion and exclusion criteria are as follows:  530 
 531 
Inclusion Criteria:   532 
1. Adult male or  female over the age of 18 that has served, or is currently serving, in the 533 
military . 534 
2. Either diagnosis of PTSD as determined by a Clinician Administered PTSD Scale for 535 
DSM -5 (CAPS -5) clinical interview or CAPS -5 severity ≥ 25, and a PCL -5 score of ≥25.  536 
3. Attempted PE treatment in the past, but did not complete treatment  (defined as dropping 537 
out from  treatment  or refusal to engage in in vivo exposure assignments ) OR identified 538 
as “at -risk” of dropping out of current exposure therapy treatment  (defined as failure to 539 
complete  3 sessions of therapy within any 6 week period , verbally indicating  that they are 540 
not comfortable with the exposure activities , and/or populations identified at higher risk of 541 
dropping out of exposure therapy  542 
 543 
Exclusion Criteria:   544 
1. Active  psychosis or  dementia at screening . 545 
2. Suicidal ideation with clear intent . 546 
3. Concurrent enrollment in another clinical trial for PTSD or depression.  547 
 548 
Peer Eligibility Criteria . Study inclusion and exclusion criteria are as follows:  549 
 550 
Inclusion Criteria:   551 
1. Adult male or  female over the age of 18 that has served, or is currently servin g, in the 552 
military.  553

 Page 13 of 36 
 2. Successful competition of exposure therapy  treatment in the past and willingness to act 554 
as peer in the program . 555 
3. PCL-5 score of 32 or lower.  556 
 557 
Exclusion Criteria:  558 
1. Active  psychosis or  dementia at screening . 559 
2. Suicidal ideation with clear intent.  560 
 561 
Medication Stabilization . Participants  meeting inclusion criteria will be asked to maintain medications 562 
at current dosages when medically appropriate. Participants who have not initiated new prescription 563 
medications in the previous 4 weeks will complete the baseline  assessment battery. However , potential 564 
participants who have recently begun trials of prescription medication will be required to wait 4 weeks 565 
prior to completing the baseline assessment battery to ensure medication stabilization, at which point 566 
the assessment battery will be admini stered  (or re -administered if applicable) . This re -administered 567 
battery will be used for pre -treatment data in analyses.  568 
 569 
7.1.4. Recruitment Process . The Ralph H. Johnson Veterans Affairs Medical Center (RHJ VAMC)  570 
catchment area  is home to a very large num ber of PTSD treatment outcome studies, as well as to 571 
several studies on suicide, depression, and anxiety. Moreover, the nationally known PTSD Clinic 572 
conducts only evidence -based psychotherapy, with an emphasis on PE, and was the first to offer this 573 
treatme nt via telehealth and via home based telehealth. As such, all RHJ VAMC Mental Health Clinic 574 
staff are cross trained in research referral to study staff for all potential participants, and research staff 575 
are housed alongside clinic staff . More relevant to t he present application, as there are a large number 576 
of providers conducting PE in both clinic and research treatment settings (19 current full time PE 577 
providers each providing both in person and home based telehealth PE), the number of PE dropouts 578 
meeting inclusion criteria and available for recruitment to this study is quite large (our current roster of 579 
dropouts just in the past 6 months is over 250, representing about 30% of cases).  580 
 581 
We have obtained (for our PE+ Exposure  Workout Buddy pilot study) and currently maintain Institutional 582 
Review Board (IRB) and Veterans Affairs Research and Development (VA RD) approval for clinical 583 
research staff to approach all Veterans who have dropped out of PE with an invitation to particip ate in 584 
the pilot feasibility workout buddy study. Each week, representatives from each of the 8 research teams 585 
attend a case staffing with all PTSD Clinical Team (PCT) clinicians to review new cases, their 586 
appropriateness for research participation, study cross referral, and to review dropouts from PE. Names 587 
will be obtained at these staffings for re -contact by research clinicians. As we are the only study 588 
including PE dropouts, recruitment via this pathway has been strong for the pilot study, and will cont inue 589 
to be significant for this project .  590 
 591 
Related to the question of whether or not participants meeting inclusion criteria are available, is whether 592 
those available participants will actually agree to return to treatment. Our pilot study data, described 593 
above, indicate that 52% of those who have dropped out of PE agree to return with the assistance of 594 
an exposure workout buddy, and 30% of these sign consents to do so immediately . The willingness of 595 
Veteran PE dropouts to consider returning to tr eatment upon hearing of the workout buddy program 596 
was extremely encouraging.  597 
 598

Peer Social Support During In Vivo Exposure for PTSD: A Program to Address Dropout from Prolonged Exposure  
 
 
 
 Page 14 of 36 
 In addition to direct contact with recent dropouts from therapy provided by the 19 active clinicians, we 599 
will list this study among those listed in our consortium institution’s ( Medical University of South 600 
Carolina) “active research projects” web page and weekly newspaper research recruitment sections. 601 
Third, primary care and mental health providers of Veterans for whom PTSD is suspected may also 602 
refer to the study. In the latter scenario, the Veteran will be informed that researchers at the VA are 603 
evaluating a treatment to help those who have dropped out of PE and the Veteran will be asked for 604 
permission to release contact information only to study personnel. If this verbal consen t is given and a 605 
referral made, project staff will contact potential candidates. Participants who do not meet inclusion 606 
criteria will nonetheless be offered services through the RHJ VAMC Mental Health service. Our final 607 
recruitment strategy will be to run a series of advertisements in relevant local newspapers.  608 
 609 
Recruitment Steps : Potential participants will be contacted by study staff when recruitment derives from 610 
the weekly PTSD clinic staff meetings. Potential participants who respond to brochures, or wh o are 611 
referred by other providers will be directed to the study coordinator for face-to-face explanation of the 612 
study in a private treatment room at  either  the RHJ VAMC , CBOC , or MUSC leased space  where they 613 
will review informed consent and have all questions answered.   If for any reason the study coordinator 614 
and patient can not meet face -to-face, participants may be contacted via telephone to discuss study 615 
parameters.   After informed consent has b een collected, the initial assessment interview will be 616 
scheduled within 7 days by our trained interviewers (who are NOT the therapists for the study). All 617 
potential participants will first complete the entire assessment interview  either face -to-face, via 618 
telephone, or via Tandberg if the assessor and patient are located at two different CBOCs ; immediately 619 
after the assessment interview, participants meeting inclusion and exclusion criteria will be randomized 620 
to condition by the study coordinator using the randomization protocol desi gned by the study statistician 621 
and informed of this outcome. Participants will be told to expect a telephone call from their counselor 622 
to start treatment within 7 days.  Additionally, we will mail letters of invitation to patients  from Dr. 623 
Acierno’s former research studies who dropped out of treatment, as well as Veterans who began 624 
treatment in the PCT clinic but did not finish.  625 
 626 
Recruitment and Enrollment Targets : See the chart on next page  for the anticipated participant 627 
recruitment . 628 
 629 
Minority and Female Recruitment . Inclusion of minorities in PTSD research with Veterans is recognized 630 
as being of critical importance (Frueh et al., 1998). Based on our previous and ongoing RHJ VAMC 631 
studies (A cierno, 2015), we estimate that approximately 40% of the sample will be African Americans; 632 
8-10% Hispanic, and 4 -6% Asian American; 10% are expected to be women.  633

 635 
7.1.5. Consent Process . Informed consent will be administered by approved individuals trained in 636 
human subjects regulations and informed consent procedures, with appropriate VAMC and University 637 
training certifications on file and up to date. These individuals will first be asked to read the treatment 638 
protocol, and will then attend a 1 -day training for study personnel given by the PI and other team 639 
members on how to provide information about the study and obtain consent for participation in the study 640 
(i.e., informed consent), and w ill role play until the PI determines excellent competency in this area. 641 
This is so that each person collecting informed consent is familiar with all study aspects.  642 
 643 
Timing and Location of Informed Consent . Informed consent will be collected in research o ffices (VA 644 
and MUSC offices) where potential candidates (both Peers and patients, as both will provide data) will 645 
be invited to learn about the study and that they will have a 50 -50 chance, like a coin toss, to be 646 
assigned to either PE+Exposure Workout Bud dy or PE+Peer General Support  conditions. Informed 647 
consent will be collected in a private, interruption free environment. Potential candidates will not be 648 
required to make a decision to participate at this initial contact, though that possibility will be a vailable. 649 
If they wish to discuss participation with significant others, they will be encouraged to do so. If any 650 
potential volunteers are illiterate, the consent form will be verbally read and explained in the presence 651 
of a witness.  652 
 653 
To reduce the burden  of participating in resear ch we may use VA approved teleconsent methods.   654 
 655 
After discussing teleconsent  procedures during screening, study staff will mail a paper consent form to 656 
the patient along with a self -addressed, stamped envelope and instructions on how to access the 657 
videoconference platform.  At the scheduled day and time of consent, staff will cont act patients via 658 
videoconference from a VA device (computer, laptop, tablet or phone) and begin the teleconsent 659 
session.  During the teleconsent video session, project staff will explain the purpose of the research, 660 
the nature of the intervention, potentia l benefits and risks, the voluntary nature of participation, and the 661 
data collection procedures. The study staff and the consent form will make it clear that the individual’s 662 
eligibility for services will not be affected by the decision to participate in t he study. They will be informed 663 
that they are being asked to participate in a research study. They will be told the nature of the 664 
procedures, informed of risks associated with their participation, asked to read the consent form, and 665 
encouraged to ask quest ions or discuss any pertinent issues.   If patients agree to consent, they will be 666

 asked to sign applicable areas of the consent/HIPAA form.  Research staff will ask patients to hold up 667 
the signed forms to the camera so that the consenter may take a screen shot of the signature.  These 668 
images will be stored on the secure VA research network.  Participants will then be asked to mail back 669 
the completed, signed consent form in the return envelope provided.  670 
 671 
Per VA Directive 6609 instructions for mailing sensiti ve materials, study staff will attach a notice with 672 
the following language on on the front of any mailed consent paperwork, and instruct participants to 673 
attach it to the completed paperwork to be returned:  674

To miti gate risk, study staff will instruct the participant to only sign those areas of the consent/HIPAA 686 
that must be in the participant’s handwriting.  Other areas of the forms (such as the name of the 687 
participant and date at the top of each page of the consent ) will be completed by study staff once the 688 
paperwork is returned.  Note that study staff expects this form of consent to be rare, and will only be 689 
offered to participants with unavoidable barriers that prevent them  or study staff  from consenting in 690

7.1.6. Subject Screening Procedures.  Following consent, a baseline assessment and screening will 694 
take place with an interviewer or study coordinator  to determin e the participant’s eligibility. The initial 695 
consent and screening will require 2-3 hours. For individuals that do not meet  study inclusion criteria, 696 
the study staff will assist with coordinating appropriate care outside of the study.  Individuals meeting 697 
the study inclusion and exclusion criteria will be randomized into one of the two treatment groups .  698

7.1.7. Compensation for P articipation.  All participants will receive $30 for the baseline assessment, 700 
$30 for the post -treatment assessment, $35 f or the 3 -month follow -up assessment, and $45 for the 6 - 701 
month follow -up assessment for a combined total of $140. Compensation may also be available in the 702 
form of Wal -Mart gift cards for peers who complete exposure activities with Veterans.  703 
  704 
7.1.8. Treatment Procedures. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of the two study 705 
conditions : 1) Experimental Condition: PE+Exposure Workout Buddy  (i.e., a peer who specifically offers 706 
social support during in vivo exposure homework)  or 2) Control Condi tion: PE+Peer General Support 707 
(i.e., a peer who does NOT engage in any support during in vivo homework , but offers support 708 
according to standard VA peer support models) .  709 
 710 
Participants will be randomly assigned (1:1) to one of the two study conditions.  After determining 711 
eligibility, enrolled patients will be assigned to treatment groups by study staff  using a web -based 712

 computer generated randomization scheme through REDCap, an application designed to support data 713 
capture for research studies. Study personne l will be able to obtain randomization assignment by 714 
completing a REDCap survey verifying inclusion/exclusion criteria. Randomization will occur at the 715 
patient level. Once a patient is randomized, he or she will be entered into the study and included in th e 716 
intent -to-treat analysis plan. The only members of the research team who will be aware of 717 
randomization assignment will be the project therapists, the research assistant, and the statistical 718 
analyst in charge of randomization. Moreover, will we will take  the following steps to minimize 719 
contamination between the two arms of the study: 1) patients in the intervention and control arms will 720 
be instructed not to share intervention materials with friends or other clinic patients; 2) patients will be 721 
given instr uctions not to disclose their treatment assignment to any other healthcare providers; and 3) 722 
per standard practices for MUSC -VA research, providers will be informed of their patients’ participation, 723 
but will be blinded to condition.  724 
 725 
1. Experimental Condition: PE+Exposure Workout Buddy . The experimental treatment is a 726 
modified version of PE insofar as social support in the form of ‘workout buddies’ for in vivo 727 
exposure homework is added to the protocol. Specifically, PE is a manualized tr eatment (Foa et 728 
al., 2007) that includes the following components: (a) psychological education about the 729 
common reactions to traumatic events and presentation of the treatment rationale (sessions 1 730 
and 2), (b) repeated  in vivo  exposure to trauma -related st imuli such as people, places, things, 731 
or situations that trigger memories of the traumatic event but are realistically safe (in vivo 732 
exercises are assigned as homework during sessions 3 through 11), (c) repeated, prolonged, 733 
imaginal exposure to traumatic m emories (imaginal exposure is implemented during sessions 3 734 
- 11; patients listen to session audiotapes for homework between sessions), and (d) relapse 735 
prevention strategies and further treatment planning (session 12).  736 
 737 
PE is based on emotional processing  theory, which suggests that traumatic events are 738 
incompletely and inaccurately encoded in memory as “fear networks.” Gradual exposure to 739 
corrective information via the confrontation of (i.e., exposure to) conditioned trauma -related 740 
stimuli within a safe a nd therapeutic environment results in a competing and antithetical memory 741 
structure that inhibits the conditioned fear response. PE relies on two primary therapeutic tools: 742 
in vivo exposure and imaginal exposure. During in vivo exposure, the patient confro nts feared, 743 
but safe, stimuli or cues that elicit trauma -related distress. During imaginal exposure, patients 744 
are guided by therapists and “revisit” the traumatic event, providing a detailed verbal account 745 
that includes sensory information, thoughts, feeli ngs, and reactions experienced during the 746 
traumatic event.  747 
 748 
Consistent with the spirit of the new VA mandate to use peers in specialty clinics such as PTSD 749 
clinics, we will offer those individuals who indicate that they have decided to drop out / have 750 
dropped out of treatment (e.g., stopped attending sessions) the opportunity to have a peer (see 751 
description of peer and training below) who has been through treatment successfully, and no 752 
longer holds a PTSD diagnosis, help them to complete in vivo exposure t rials as an ‘exposure 753 
workout buddy,’ by offering social support during exposure homework.  754 
 755 
Peer Selection.  For the pilot feasibility study, a large number of peers volunteered and were 756 
trained. Most of these peers have indicated that they will be available for this study . We will use 757 
identical methods to recruit and train peer exposure workout buddies as prove d feasible in the 758 
Version:  05/07/20  (Amendment 13) 
Peer Social Support During In Vivo Exposure for PTSD: A Program to Address Dropout from Prolonged Exposure  
 
 
 
 Page 18 of 36 
 pilot study. Specifically, therapists will be asked if they have any patients who have completed 759 
treatment and did very well, both overall and in particular with in vivo exposure therapy 760 
components. Therapists will then be asked to contac t these patients, inform them about the 761 
exposure workout buddy program, and ask them if they would like Dr. Acierno, a VA clinician 762 
and researcher, to discuss the program further. Upon being contacted, Dr. Acierno will outline 763 
the nature of expectations an d research characteristics, and schedule a training session. Thus, 764 
initial nominations for the program are based on therapist impressions of successful candidates 765 
AFTER they have completed treatment. Peers who are candidates for the workout buddy 766 
program w ill be consented, evaluated for presence of PTSD diagnosis via the CAPS 5, and only 767 
those who no longer have the PTSD diagnosis will be permitted to participate in this study. Peers 768 
will also serve in the capacity of general peer support for the comparison condition , but will be 769 
explicitly directed NOT to meet the Veteran during in vivo exposure assignments. In fact, the 770 
only meetings  between general VA support peers and patients take pla ce at the VA , as is 771 
standard with VA peer programs  (further description of duties below)  772 
 773 
Peer Exposure Assignment ‘Workout Buddy’ Training.  NOTE: Peers are not therapists or 774 
therapist replacements, and the major activities of the peers are to simply meet Veterans at in 775 
vivo exposure homework sites and offer encouragement and support. To illustrate, this is like a 776 
workout buddy agreeing to meet you at the gym. This person is not a physical therapist or trainer, 777 
rather, they are just a peer who agrees to go to the gym and offer verbal support during gym 778 
activities. This is exactly the role of the peer: to offer verbal support  during  in vivo exposure 779 
activities that have been agreed upon. Thus, logistics and  limits  of responsibility, not skills, are 780 
the primar y focus of training. Much time is spent emphasizing appropriate rule s of confidentiality, 781 
self-disclos ure (which is instructed to be limited), boundaries and safety procedures. As 782 
mentioned, analogies have been very helpful: that of peer and participants a s ‘workout buddies’ 783 
and that of peer and participant having the same relationship and responsibilities to one another 784 
as group therapy patients. These analogies are applied as described below. Each peer will 785 
attend a 2 -hour training meeting with the PI Aci erno and Co -I Hernandez -Tejada. During this 786 
meeting, the rationale for in vivo exposure will be reviewed, and the benefits of having a 787 
supportive partner, friend, or exposure workout buddy during in vivo exposure will be outlined. 788 
Training will explicitly include content wherein peers will be clearly informed that they 789 
are not engaging in the role of therapist or providing therapy; rather, their role is equivalent to 790 
that of a supportive group member in traditional group counseling (with which many Veterans  791 
are familiar), only this support is given in the context of exposure exercises. In such a situation, 792 
group members offer each other advice and support on how to achieve stated goals. In the 793 
present case, the stated and agreed upon goal will be the in vivo  exposure therapy assignment. 794 
As with group counseling members, peers are trained in the importance of confidentiality, and 795 
are not paid or compensated for their time (they are reimbursed for fuel). This clarifies that they 796 
are not in the role of a compensated therapist while also speaking to the sustainability of the 797 
program, a position underscored by the fact that we have had such a high Peer volunteer rate 798 
(85% of those approached) (see Preliminary Study #2). Limits to personal r esponsibility will be 799 
clearly outlined, and peers will be well educated that neither the outcome of the treatment, nor 800 
the disposition of the patient is their responsibility. We will review potential negative outcomes, 801 
including patient suicide, and apply the limits of personal peer responsibility to each. Moreover, 802 
we will make it explicitly clear that exactly and only those roles and responsibilities found in group 803 
Version:  05/07/20  (Amendment 13) 
Peer Social Support During In Vivo Exposure for PTSD: A Program to Address Dropout from Prolonged Exposure  
 
 
 
 Page 19 of 36 
 counseling sessions, including support, respect, and confidentiality, are in place here, wi th the 804 
exception that meeting locations are offsite and without therapist direction.   805 
 806 
Workout Buddy Logistics & Supervision: Getting Started . Our pilot study experience allowed us 807 
to refine methods of initiating the exposure workout buddy program to the f ollowing steps: Once 808 
patients have agreed to re -initiate treatment, the available peer in closest proximity to the patient 809 
will be asked by the project coordinator to call in to the next therapy session. During the session, 810 
the therapist will make introduc tions and the peer will listen to the patient and therapist review 811 
the next item of the in vivo exposure hierarchy in depth. The location, timing, outline, description, 812 
and parameters of the in vivo exposure therapy assignment will be reviewed and will be clear to 813 
patient, peer, and therapist . Once this clarity has been achieved, peer and patient will finalize 814 
arrangements to meet at a set time and place to engage in this exposure trial and will be directed 815 
to arrange at least 1  such meeting per week for 3 -4 weeks. The analogy of a workout buddy will 816 
be used, insofar as the role of the peer is to be present and encourage the Veteran during his 817 
or her exposure efforts . For patients who dropped out of treatment prior to developing and 818 
engaging in hierarchy ite m exposure, the workout buddy ‘session call in’ will be delayed until this 819 
hierarchy is established. Once established and reviewed, the peer will call into the next session 820 
and discuss logistics of meeting patient at the exposure hierarchy item location wi th patient and 821 
therapist.  822 
 823 
Note that with respect to peer behaviors, these are PRECISELY the procedures we encourage 824 
and have used when delivering exposure -based therapies in group settings (see Smith et al., 825 
2015) and to those with supportive family memb ers. Specifically, we encourage group members 826 
to work together during in vivo exposure trials in between sessions to offer encouragement and 827 
praise for successful completion. In this instance, we are borrowing that effective aspect of group 828 
therapy and app lying it in dyads to patients who have dropped out prematurely from exposure 829 
based treatment.  830 
 831 
As with the feasibility trial, peers will not be matched on gender or age, except in cases of Military 832 
Sexual Trauma, for which peers are matched on gender. Peer s will be selected on the basis of 833 
geographic proximity to participants. After the participant, workout buddy peer, and therapist 834 
hold a conference call to review logistics of in vivo exposure trials, therapists will speak with only 835 
the participant to assu re that he or she continues to want to participate with a peer exposure 836 
workout buddy. Over the following weeks, this ‘check -in’ with participants will be repeated and 837 
the therapist will ask the patient to comment on any problems or benefits associated wit h in vivo 838 
exposures that were accompanied by a peer workout buddy to obtain a progress report of how 839 
exposure trials are going, and to determine if there were any issues that should be discussed. 840 
Similarly, following the first scheduled in vivo session, th e therapist will contact the peer to review 841 
how the exposure homework went. Subsequently, peers, patients, and therapists will hold five - 842 
minute telephone check -ins during treatment sessions to assure that exposures are going well 843 
according to both patient and peer. In the event a peer is not available to call in during a treatment 844 
session, the therapist will contact them  after the session. This investment of therapist time has 845 
not been a problem in the feasibility trial, and will be precisely measured . Finally, during the first 846 
therapist call with the peer, the therapist will ask if the peer would like to continue with the 847 
participant and if there are any issues or problems. If a peer indicates that they prefer to no 848 
longer work with a participant, a dif ferent workout buddy will be recruited. If two workout buddies 849 
Version:  05/07/20  (Amendment 13) 
Peer Social Support During In Vivo Exposure for PTSD: A Program to Address Dropout from Prolonged Exposure  
 
 
 
 Page 20 of 36 
 indicate for any one participant that they prefer not to work with that participant, the peer workout 850 
buddy program will be terminated for that participant, and therapists will include these 851 
interpersonal events as topics of therapeutic focus appended to subsequent PE sessions. This 852 
has not occurred in our previous feasibility trial.  853 
 854 
To ensure that participants are not currently experiencing significant PTSD  symptoms when 855 
serving as peers , a PC L will be administered at the baseline assessment, of which peers must 856 
score below 32.  Of note, a score higher than 32 does not necessarily indicate  only elevated 857 
PTSD symptoms because this measure contains questions related to depression; therefore, the 858 
PI may determine eligibility based on PTSD versus depression symptomology. In these 859 
instances, peers will be offered “booster” sessions by their previous therapists from which they 860 
received the ir initial exposure  treatment.  Booster sessions will consist primarily of emotional 861 
processing and /or confronting current life stressors which may contribute to current elevated 862 
PTSD symptoms.   Peers will be administered frequent PCL measures to assure that scores 863 
remain lower than the threshold, and may be offered b ooster sessions at any time during their 864 
participation in the study.    865 
 866 
In Vivo Exercises with Peers.  As detailed above, each peer workout buddy will undergo a 2-hour 867 
training  to review expectations, responsibilities, and most importantly, limits of responsibilities . 868 
Specific discussion of engaging in only those activities the workout buddy feels comfortable 869 
performing is held. Specific review of excluded activities  will also be held. All workout buddies 870 
engage only in hierarchy items jointly determin ed by the therapist and participant, with assent of 871 
the workout buddy. No new, or unscheduled exposure activities, initiated on the part of the 872 
workout buddy or the participant are permitted. Workout buddies are directed to communicate 873 
with participants if  either party feels or seems to feel uncomfortable with the activity in question. 874 
The difference between discomfort arising from conditioned anxiety that is part of PTSD and 875 
discomfort arising from feelings that the situation is inappropriate are discussed  as part of peer 876 
training.  877 
 878 
Only situational activities, in clearly safe places, will be included in the in vivo exposure 879 
participation events by workout buddies. This will be determined by review with therapist and 880 
workout buddy. If EITHER party feels th ere is more than minimal risk, the activity will not be 881 
included. Note: risk of anxiety on the part of the participant is not a justifiable reason to exclude 882 
an activity; indeed, producing and dealing with such anxiety in a supportive environment is the 883 
point of in vivo exercises . It is impossible to list every possible activity that should be avoided vs. 884 
included. However, several common activities, listed below, are excluded :   885 
• activities involving driving together on the part of either the exposure worko ut buddy or the 886 
peer as driver (public transportation, such as taking a bus together is permitted);  887 
• activities in or around private residences of the participant or exposure workout buddy;  888 
• activities involving weapons (e.g., shooting range);  889 
• new or previou sly unlisted or unscheduled activities; and  890 
• activities that are associated with risk or danger as defined per therapist and or peer workout 891 
buddy.  892

 Page 21 of 36 
 Workout buddies and participants are told that the workout buddy program is only in place for a 894 
given patien t for 3 -4 weeks, at least once  per week, and is a means by which to allow participants 895 
to progress to their own, independently conducted in vivo exposure trials. Thus, ‘phase out’ of 896 
the program is built in from the beginning. Workout buddies will focus on  helping participants 897 
engage in those exposure exercises that typically are social in nature. Again, any exposure trials, 898 
such as driving, that require the participant to engage alone, or from which workout buddies are 899 
specifically prohibited will not be t he target of this program.  900 
 901 
2. Control Condition: PE+Peer General  Peer Support . Participants in this condition will receive PE 902 
(see above) and be assigned  a peer  support volunteer  who will NOT engage in any support 903 
during the in vivo homework. The primary purpose of the peer in this condition is to emulate 904 
standard VA PTSD peer support procedures. Therefore, in this conditions peers  provide general 905 
support, such as remind ing and encour aging  participants to attend appointments,  meeting with 906 
them at the VA 2 -4 times per month to assess general progress,  check ing up on them once per 907 
week via telephone and ask ing about current treatment progress, life stresses, opportunities, 908 
problems and successes, and offer ing general support with VA programs . The PE component 909 
of this  treatment will be matched to experimental condition in terms of session number and 910 
duration (12  sessions); treatment completion will be defined as for the experimental condition 911 
(minimum 10 sessions or pre-specified reductions in PCL score at two consecutive sessions; 912 
see above). Counselors will deliver treatment according to the same schedule as th e 913 
experimental condition, once weekly for 75 -90 minutes.  914 
 915 
Treatment Providers  Training, and Supervision . Treatment providers for both conditions  will be master’s 916 
level counselors with at least 2 years of experience providing evidence based  counseling to adults. All 917 
providers will perform both treatments in equal measure to control for non -specific therapist effects , as 918 
with our prior three PE treatment outcome studies . All project therapists have already engaged in 919 
training through the prio r PE studies and workout buddy pilot study. However, for new therapists, 920 
providers will undergo a 4 -day PE workshop and a 4 hour PE+Exposure Workout Buddy Training with 921 
Drs. Hernandez -Tejada and Acierno . During the project, therapists will follow the treat ment manual and 922 
will undergo regular  peer supervision directed by  Dr. Birks.  923 
 924 
Treatment Integrity and Adherence . The present study will obtain a quantitative measure of protocol 925 
adherence through a checklist of specific procedures sch eduled in the treatments outlined above. In 926 
order to ensure that treatments are competently administered in accord with protocols as written, all 927 
sessions will be audiotaped, and 20% of these will be randomly selected and rated for competence and 928 
adherence  by co -investigators . This will also allow us to study any differences between conditions on 929 
specific and non -specific factors, such as length of therapy, therapist empathy and rapport. Raters, 930 
blind to treatment condition, will rate the tapes independently to allow for the computation of inter -rater 931 
reliability. To evaluate adherence , rating forms were developed based upon the treatment manual to 932 
determine if the therapist appropriately c overed the content of each session (i.e., demonstrated the 933 
particular behavior described in each item). To evaluate competence , rating forms were developed to 934 
assess how well the therapists accomplished a range of relevant tasks for each. These rating form s 935 
use 7 -point Likert scale response formats, and are modeled after the therapist rating forms used in 936 
other studies of cognitive -behavioral treatments, including our own treatment outcome studies.  937 
 938

Peer Social Support During In Vivo Exposure for PTSD: A Program to Address Dropout from Prolonged Exposure  
 
 
 
 Page 22 of 36 
 Treatment integrity can also be challenged by the introduc tion of non -study treatments. That is, 939 
participants may seek additional treatment on their own during follow -up data collection periods. This 940 
is particularly a problem if one treatment does not “work” and participants naturally look elsewhere for 941 
help. Ind ividuals cannot ethically be prevented from seeking treatment. Therefore, we will assess, at 942 
post treatment and during follow -up periods, whether participants have obtained additional mental 943 
health treatment. Participants who do receive additional treatmen t will be compared to others within 944 
their treatment conditions that do not receive such additional intervention. Any differences noted will 945 
result in relevant adjustments to data analytic procedures (e.g., reporting data summaries of individuals 946 
receiving other treatment).  947 
 948 
Attrition and Retention . As study participants may have already dropped out of PE treatment once and 949 
may arguably be more likely to do so again in the future, this study has been powered to offset a 950 
projected 35% dropout rate during trea tment, and a 10 -15% loss to follow -up during the 6 -month follow - 951 
up period. Patients who attend at least 10 sessions or evince two consecutive weeks with PTSD Clinical 952 
Checklist -Military Version (PCL -5) scores below 20 (note, the National Center for PTSD su ggested 953 
cutoff is 33 (Weathers et al., 2013) ) will be considered completers. Participants will be allowed to make - 954 
up sessions when appropriate or necessary within a 4 -week window. Make -up sessions for subjects in 955 
both conditions will be handled in the same  manner: when feasible, these sessions will be scheduled 956 
for later the same week. We will minimize drop out from the study by providing monetary compensation 957 
for completing ba seline, post treatment, and 3, 6 -month follow -up assessments (but not treatment 958 
sessions). Additionally, following the informed consent process, we will request additional contact 959 
information (two family members and/or friends) who would know how to get in touch with the participant 960 
if we are unable t o do so with his/her primary contact number.  We will also specifically ask for e -mail 961 
and cell phone contact information. This information will be updated at each assessment time point. 962 
We also will employ the following strategies to maintain study partici pation: 1) We will stress the 963 
importance of attendance during the first session and educate patients regarding the treatment process, 964 
treatment participation, and (for the experimental group) partnering with a workout buddy for exposure 965 
trials; 2) Study pe rsonnel will send letters ahead of telephone and/or e -mail scheduling contacts and 966 
make reminder telephone calls to participants on the day or evening prior to each session; 3) Study 967 
personnel will coordinate care, as needed, with participant’s case manage rs, psychiatrists, social 968 
workers, and other care providers who have acted as referral agents for the study; 4) Study personnel 969 
will be flexible in accommodating participant schedules for treatment sessions; and 5) Project staff will 970 
meet weekly to review scheduling activities and problem solve regarding strategies and approaches 971 
that may increase successful follow -up and retention.  972

7.3. Study Procedures . The following stud y procedures will be followed:  976 
• A member of the research team will explain the purpose of the study to potential participants . 977 
Potential participants will be asked to read and sign the consent .  978 
• If the participant has been referred from another study and already undergone baseline testing, the 979 
participant will be asked as part of the consent process to use these assessments rather than 980 
repeating the assessment battery.  981 
• If the participant is newly referred to this study or declines use of previously complet ed assessments, 982 
he or she will meet with an evaluator and complete the assessment questionnaires.  983

 • The results of these screening procedures will be reviewed to determine whether it is appropriate 984 
for the participant to continue in the study . If it would n ot be appropriate for the person to continue 985 
in the study, a member of the research team will discuss the reasons why and, if needed, coordinate 986

 1007  
The study assessments will be administered online through the Charleston VA’s academic affiliate, 1008  
Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC)  REDCap ™ (Research Electronic Data Capture) software. 1009  
REDCap ™ is a software toolset and workflow methodology for electronic collection and management 1010  
of research clinical trial data.  It provides secure, web -based flexible applications, including real time  1011  
validation rules with automated data type and range checks at the time of entry.  The underlying 1012  
database is hosted in a secure data center at MUSC, a secure environment for data systems and 1013  
servers on campus, and includes redundancy, failover capability,  backups and extensive security 1014  
checks.  The system has several layers of protection including user/group account management, “Data 1015  
Access Groups” which allow data to be entered by multiple groups in one database with segmented 1016  
user rights for entered data , audit trails for all changes, queries and reports, and Secure Sockets Layer 1017  
(SSL) encryption.  The administration of study assessments will be conducted and monitored by the 1018  
study staff through a password -protected REDCap account. Only research team membe rs will have 1019  
access to the data. Data will remain on REDC ap and will be uploaded to the  VA secure network until it 1020  
is verified as de -identified per HIPAA regulation. All paper forms will be held in a locked filing cabinet 1021  
in the recruiting Si te PI’s locked  research offices. Study data will be collected by study ID only via 1022  
REDC ap. REDCap data will regularly be backed up and exported to the VA secure  server . At the study’s 1023  
conclusion, the electronic crosswalk file linking study IDs with patient identifiers w ill be destroyed  per 1024  
MUSC and VA policy .  1025

 7.3.2.1 . Instrumentation.  See the table at Section 7.1.2  above  for a summary of the assessments and 1028  
timing of administration . All measures are being administered for research purposes . Assessments will 1029  
be administered in person whenever possible . However, in order to accommodate participant 1030  
schedules and/or instances in which a participant may have left the local area at the time of a follow up 1031  
assessment, we may collect full or partial assessments in perso n or via phone or electronic data capture 1032  
using a secure link to the HIPAA -compliant REDCap database . Assessments completed via phone or 1033  
remote electronic data capture will not include psychophysiological measures . Reasonable efforts will 1034  
be made to collec t all data as described in this protocol, but we expect some participants may not be 1035  
able to complete part or all of any given follow -up assessment.  1036  
 1037  
7.3.2.2 . Data Storage and Access . 1038  
 1039  
Participant  Identification . A file of research identification numbers and associated social security 1040  
numbers will be stored separately on paper and on computer, for purposes of audit by the VA/MUSC 1041  
IRB, if necessary.  1042  
 1043  
Protection of Patient Confidentiality/Disposition of Data . Prot ection of participant confidentiality is an 1044  
important component of subject protection. The main potential risk to subjects is violation of their 1045  
confidentiality. We will take careful precautions to maintain confidentiality for all subjects, using 1046  
procedure s we have used with similar previous studies: The investigators and the research team  will 1047  
sign a confidentiality agreement with the Charleston VAMC that no identifying information of specific 1048  
individuals will appear in any internal reports prepared for th e VA or external documents (e.g., peer - 1049  
reviewed publications, presentations). All study data related to psychological outcomes (i.e., the 1050  
participant responses to questionnaires) and demographics will not have any unique identifying data 1051  
commingled or atta ched in any way. There will be no linkage between a volunteer’s identity and their 1052  
responses. The  master list of participants (again, not linked to any participant responses) will remain 1053  
on the VA secure network in an encrypted folder, and the document its elf will be encrypted with a 1054  
password for an added measure of protection . All data will be stored in locked files or on encrypted 1055  
computers in the PI’s research offices .  1056  
 1057  
When study results are published or presented, only aggregate reports of the results  will be used and 1058  
subjects’ identity will not be revealed. All analyses will be conducted on de -identified data only. All paper 1059  
documents will be securely stored in locked filing cabinets. Access to research records (paper and 1060  
computerized) will be restric ted to the project staff. Specifically, access to de -identified study data will 1061  
be limited to named project investigators, the project coordinator, VAMC audit personnel, and MUSC 1062  
IRB audit personnel. The list of participant names will be kept separate from  all data, and will be 1063  
available only to project staff .  1064  
 1065  
Data will be maintained per VA protocols, and not less than two years prior to permanent storage . We 1066  
will seek guidance regarding VA policies for maintenance terms of psychological data to determine  the 1067  
exact period of time that will elapse upon completion of which all study records will be stored 1068  
permanently . 1069  
 1070  
Data regarding sensitive information such as HIV status or illegal residency will not be collected. Rather, 1071  
only demographic and psychological outcome data will be collected. However, State and Local 1072

 authorities do require reporting of potentially suicidal  or homicidal behavior. These exceptions to 1073  
confidentiality will be clearly explained to volunteers during the informed consent process.  1074  
 1075  
All investigators and project personnel have completed a certified program of instruction in the 1076  
protection of human s ubjects in research, such as the VA website tutorial, NIH website tutorial or the 1077  
University of Miami CITI course.  1078  
 1079  
7.3.3. Human Biological Specimen (Biomarker) Processing . Not applicable. This study will neither 1080  
be collecting specimens nor conducting lab oratory evaluations of biomarkers.  1081  
 1082  
7.4. Statistical Consideration   1083  
 1084  
7.4.1 . Sample Size Estimation . For the continuous longitudinal clinical, functional, and process 1085  
outcomes for Primary Aims, with 50 subjects randomized to each  intervention group, we will have 89% 1086  
power to detect at least a 0.3 standardized (sd units) effect size between the two interve ntion groups 1087  
assuming 4 time points (baseline, post -treatment, and 3- & 6-month follow -ups), and; intra -class 1088  
correlation no greater than 0.5; level of significance <=0.05, two -tailed . A standardized effect size of 1089  
0.35 sd (Cohen’s d, “small” effect) is eq uivalent to a raw effect size of 2.8 raw scale units for PCL -5 1090  
(assuming  pooled sd for post treatment PCL -5 scores is 8.1, from preliminary data) . For the 1091  
dichotomous process outcome completer/dropout, with 50 subjects per group, the study will have 85% 1092  
power to detect a relative improvement in retention for the experimental condition of 20%. Power will 1093  
be 89% for the continuous ‘dose’ received measure of number of sessions attended, assuming an effect 1094  
size of 0.3 for the experimental condition. We make the se conservative effect size predictions based 1095  
on the fact that we intend to use Intent to Treat (ITT ) analyses for primary outcomes for which group 1096  
average treatment effects are lower compared to completer analyses.  1097  
 1098  
To account for dilution effect of ITT analyses, "administrative" dropout, i.e., those who drop out 1099  
immediately upon randomization (do not receive a treatment or return for a post baseline visit), and the 1100  
need to impute missing data, we will ‘over recruit’ by 15% to achieve a final ITT sample size of 58 1101  
participants randomized to each treatment group (i.e., ITT N = 116, Completer N = 100).  1102  
 1103  
7.4.3 . Data Analysis.  1104  
 1105  
Preliminary Descriptive Analyses . Satisfaction and process measures will be summarized for pat ients 1106  
and peers. Baseline values for demographic, war theatre, clinical, and other putative prognostic 1107  
variables will be compared for imbalance across the two randomized treatment conditions and across 1108  
the non -randomized, exploratory conditions (in person vs. telehealth delivered PE+ Exposure  Workout 1109  
Buddy vs. PE+Peer General Support ). These analyses will identify potential confounding variables to 1110  
be used as covariates in subsequent analyses and will include race/ethnicity, age, psychiatric 1111  
comorbidity,  and initial disease severity.  To investigate potential limits on generalizability, we will 1112  
compare characteristics of participants who prematurely exit and/or are protocol non -adherent (i.e., 1113  
they dropped out again) against those who were comp leters/protocol adherent . Characteristics of 1114  
patients who do not complete the study or do not adhere to treatment will be compared for both 1115  
conditions.  1116

Peer Social Support During In Vivo Exposure for PTSD: A Program to Address Dropout from Prolonged Exposure  
 
 
 
 Page 26 of 36 
 Objective 1a : To determine the differential impact on treatment dose received of ‘PE+Exposure 1118  
Workout B uddy’ vs. ‘ PE+Peer General Support ’ in individuals who have dropped out of evidence based 1119  
treatment for PTSD in terms of the number of sessions completed following randomization to either 1120  
treatment. Objective 1b . To determine if this differential dose rece ived is amplified or diminished with 1121  
respect to prior identified risk factors such as age, race, gender, or substance use.  1122  
 1123  
Analysis Issues for Objective 1 : As mentioned in the Measures section, ‘dose’, or number of new 1124  
sessions received is likely confounded by ‘prior dose’, or number of pre -dropout sessions 1125  
received prior to initiation of this study. Nonetheless, the basic question of treatment dose as 1126  
measured by number of new sessions completed after receiving the experimental treatment is 1127  
import ant and will be obtained. However, to deal with this potential confound, (a) number of 1128  
sessions completed prior to dropout will serve as a covariate in subsequent analyses & (b) ‘dose’ 1129  
will also be examined dichotomously, in terms of between group proporti ons of treatment 1130  
completers (defined as completing 10 or more new sessions OR 2 subsequent PCL5 scores 1131  
below 33) .  1132  
 1133  
Analysis Plan for Objective 1 : We will adopt a relatively direct analytic approach for this first 1134  
objective. Specifically, if preliminary de scriptive analyses reveal baseline differences in 1135  
psychopathology or other potentially confounding variables, including number of sessions 1136  
completed prior to dropout (i.e., prior to entry into this study) these will serve as covariates in 1137  
ANCOVA, which wil l be used to compare average dose received in terms of number of treatment 1138  
sessions in each group. These ANCOVAs will be repeated with race and gender as between 1139  
group factors to determine if any interaction is present between treatment condition and these  1140  
demographic characteristics. A similarly direct approach will be taken for the dichotomous 1141  
variable of treatment completion, for which we will initially use chi square analyses for bivariate 1142  
examination of treatment completion in terms of each demographic  variable and each treatment 1143  
condition, followed by logistic regression in which those variables producing significant chi 1144  
square relationships to this outcome will be included in regression models. We will use 95% 1145  
confidence intervals (CI) for single prop ortions to estimate the proportion of participants who 1146  
complete treatment within  each intervention group. We will also estimate the difference in 1147  
completer proportions between groups using 95% CI for difference in proportions . In addition, 1148  
frequency distributions describing participants' reasons for discontinuation of study participation 1149  
will be developed. In this way, the effect of each treatment condition on ‘dose’, measured in 1150  
terms of overall number of sessions completed, an d in terms of proportion of participants 1151  
completing at least 10 sessions / achieving clinical cutoff will be described.  1152  
 1153  
Objective 2a . To determine differential effectiveness of ‘PE +Exposure Workout Buddy’ vs. ‘PE+Peer 1154  
General Support ’ who does NOT engage  in any support during in vivo homework  with therapy dropouts 1155  
in terms of therapeutic gains over time on measures of PTSD symptomatology (i.e., ‘treatment 1156  
outcome’). Objective 2b . To determine if differential effectiveness is amplified or diminished with r espect 1157  
to race, gender, age or substance use.  1158  
 1159  
Analysis Issues for Objective 2 . The primary analyses for this objective will use the ITT sample, 1160  
which will consist of all participants who are randomized to either PE+Exposure Workout Buddy 1161  
or PE+Peer General Support . Patients will not be discontinued from the study assessments 1162  
becaus e of non -adherence and all patients will remain in the study assessment protocol unless 1163

 Page 27 of 36 
 consent is withdrawn or there are concerns regarding patient safety. We will adopt several 1164  
approaches to dealing with missing data for the intent -to-treat analysis set:   for continuous 1165  
outcomes, we will employ mixed effects models (GLMM, MEM) which allow for measurement of 1166  
subjects at different time points and missing data (Hedeker & Gibbons, 2006);  for single endpoint 1167  
imputation, we will use the multiple imputation meth ods of Little and Rubin (1987) . We will model 1168  
the dichotomous outcome, missing/not missing post treatment score, using logistic regression 1169  
to determine if missingness is related to treatment condition. In a secondary analysis, the results 1170  
of analyses using  treatment completers (completer analyses) will be compared with results using 1171  
the full set of all randomized participants (ITT analyses) to test sensitivity of study conclusions 1172  
to dropouts .  1173  
 1174  
To address possible Type I errors due to the number of analyse s: (1) for the primary analyses, 1175  
we specify a priori  the primary measures corresponding to the stated a priori hypotheses (with 1176  
other measures being considered secondary/exploratory) and maintain the significance level 1177  
(alpha) at 0.05 for analyses involvin g the primary study variables; and (2) for secondary analyses 1178  
using additional outcome variables and combat exposure measures, we will adjust p -values 1179  
using a Bonferroni -type correction for multiple outcomes and will report both unadjusted and 1180  
adjusted p -values. Secondary outcomes and exploratory analyses will be evaluated qualitatively 1181  
in terms of consistency with primary results and cautiously in terms of statistical significance of 1182  
results . The sensitivity of the study results to adjustment for multiplic ity of outcomes will be 1183  
evaluated.  1184  
 1185  
Analysis Plan for Objective 2 . Our primary outcome is the PCL5 continuous score for PTSD. 1186  
Clinical (CAPS, PCL -5, Patient Health Questionnaire), functional (SF -36), and process 1187  
(treatment credibility scales, patient satis faction, session rating scale, service delivery 1188  
perceptions, retention in treatment) outcomes will be compared using the generalized linear 1189  
mixed models (GLMM) approach . In addition to accommodating a wide range of distributional 1190  
assumptions [continuous (e .g., PCL -5, CAPS, Patient Health Questionnaire), 1191  
dichotomous/categorical (e.g., binomial),  ordinal (e.g. patient ratings), count (e.g., number of 1192  
missed homework assignments (Poisson), the approach accommodates multilevel data 1193  
(clustering) such as repeated  measurements of subjects, missing data, time -varying covariates, 1194  
and possible cluster effects within sites or clinics through inclusion of random effects in the model 1195  
(Hedeker & Gibbons, 2006) . For the continuous outcomes, for example PCL5, GLMM is 1196  
equiva lent to a linear mixed effect model (MEM) approach . MEM analyses estimate individual 1197  
change in outcome for each subject in addition to estimating average change in outcome within 1198  
each intervention arm . Covariates, such as initial severity as measured by th e PCL -5, age, race, 1199  
and comorbid illnesses will be added to the model to adjust for putative confounding variables . 1200  
Unadjusted and covariate -adjusted least squares means for continuous outcomes will be 1201  
compared at relevant time points (e.g., immediate post  end-of-active -intervention and 6 -month 1202  
end-of-study time points) using appropriate model contrasts and the Tukey -Kramer adjustment 1203  
for multiple comparisons . We will first assess trends in the outcome profiles over the full study 1204  
period (active + follow -up). In these analyses, we will allow slopes to differ depending upon 1205  
whether it is active or follow -up phase . In secondary analyses, we will also assess separately 1206  
the active phase and the follow -up phase (3 - & 6-months) trajectories to remove from the active 1207  
phase results the complicating issue of intervening events in the follow -up phase. Intervention 1208  
specific patient satisfaction items will be described separately within each intervention group 1209  
Version:  05/07/20  (Amendment 13) 
Peer Social Support During In Vivo Exposure for PTSD: A Program to Address Dropout from Prolonged Exposure  
 
 
 
 Page 28 of 36 
 using standard de scriptive analyses (e.g., means, proportions along with corresponding 1210  
confidence intervals). Global satisfaction level (e.g., overall satisfaction level) will be compared 1211  
between intervention groups using the GLMM process described above.  Mediation effects  of 1212  
perceived level of social support on outcome w ill also be examined . 1213  
 1214  
Estimation of effect sizes . The magnitude of treatment group differences (effect sizes) for 1215  
outcome variables will be estimated using 95% confidence intervals (CI) . Effect sizes will be 1216  
used to evaluate clinical significance of treatment group comparisons.  1217  
 1218  
Exploratory Objective 3 . To determine the presence of initial signals of differential dose and 1219  
effectiveness of  ‘PE+Exposure  Workout Buddy’ when delivered in traditional in person (face to face) 1220  
vs. telehealth formats . (Note, the parameters by which this objective will be achieved are naturalistic 1221  
insofar as this variable is not subject to randomization because participants who  had received telehealth 1222  
or in person PE prior to dropout and thus prior to this study will continue to receive treatment in the 1223  
same modality upon randomization to either PE+Exposure Workout Buddy or PE+Peer General 1224  
Support ). 1225  
  1226  
Analysis Plan for Explorato ry Objective 3  The analytic requirements of the exploratory objective 1227  
to detect initial signal of differential effect of the PE+Exposure Workout Buddy program for those 1228  
receiving treatment via telehealth vs. in person mirror those of Objective 1 with respe ct to ‘dose’ 1229  
and ‘% completing treatment’, and Objective 2 with respect to clinical outcomes. As such, the 1230  
logistic regression analyses conducted for Objective 1 will be repeated, this time including 1231  
treatment delivery medium (in person vs. telehealth) as an independent predictor variable. 1232  
Likewise, the analytic plan for Objective 2 will also be repeated, including treatment delivery 1233  
medium as an independent variable for continuous clinical outcome analyses. In this way, the 1234  
hypothesized advantage of the PE +Exposure Workout Buddy program for telehealth will receive 1235  
initial study.  1236  
 1237  
As is typical in most treatment outcome studies, we will also supplement exploratory analyses 1238  
by examining the possible mediating effect of the process variables on clinical outcom es. These 1239  
analyses address the question of whether process outcomes such as satisfaction with the 1240  
intervention, treatment credibility, and session attendance explain the relationship between the 1241  
outcome variable (PTSD severity) and intervention group (prim ary independent variable). For 1242  
example, these analyses will explore whether a more positive outcome in one group may be 1243  
explained by greater session attendance and higher satisfaction ratings in that group, or as 1244  
hypothesized here, social support. Specific ally, in mediator analyses, it is posited that variation 1245  
in the primary independent variable (intervention group) accounts for variation in the mediators 1246  
(e.g., social support, session attendance), and variations in the mediators account for variations 1247  
in outcome (PTSD severity) . For these analyses, we will use the GLMM modeling approach 1248  
described above coupled with the method of Baron and Kenney (1986) and Holmbeck (1997) 1249  
for evaluating putative mediators.  1250  
 1251  
7.7. Confidentiality . Some  in-person therapy sessions and interview assessments will be delivered in 1252  
private offices located at the Ralph H Johnson VAMC 109 Bee Street, Charleston, SC 29401 or an 1253  
associated Community Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs). Those addresses are: Beaufort VA Outp atient 1254

 1271  
7.7.2. Data Protection . Data will be coded using an as signed number. Data collected on paper during 1272  
treatment will be placed into locked cabinets at the respective clinics where the data is collected . 1273  
Electronically captured data as well as audio/video recordings will be uploaded to a secure database . 1274  
Every m ember of the research team will be trained and monitored about how to handle and protect 1275  
both medical and research records. Furthermore, the research team strictly controls access to study 1276  
data. These audio files will only be used for the purpose of fideli ty to ensure the treatment is being 1277  
delivered in accordance with the treatment manual for this study only . Upon study termination, and 1278  
once the data has been analyzed to the fullest extent by the researchers, the audio and video files will 1279  
be deleted from the secure server if in accordance with VA and MUSC policy .  1280  
 1281  
 1282  
8.0 RISKS/BENEFITS ASSESSMENT  1283  
 1284  
8.1. Foreseeable Risks.  Potential psychological risk of the treatment includes exacerbations of 1285  
distress during the assessment or treatment sessions. Measures to avoid this include constructing an 1286  
intervention that has as one of its primary aims, reduction of distress and depress ion through increased 1287  
activity. Additional measures include informing participants that they are free to terminate treatment 1288  
sessions at any time. Risks associated with follow -up assessment include the possibility that 1289  
participants might be upset by questi ons pertaining to their emotional functioning. Again, all participants 1290  
will be informed at the outset that they may terminate participation at any point. Our past research 1291  
suggests that data collection using many of these measures can be conducted without undue 1292  
psychological distress or exacerbation of symptoms among adult participants. This experience includes 1293  
substantial research with younger and older adults, rape victims, victims of other forms of violence, and 1294  
work on large -scale studies asking questio ns about similar topics with general population samples. 1295  
Alternative treatments generally include group treatment, treatment by antidepressant medication, or 1296  
by relatively invalidated psychotherapeutic techniques.  1297  
 1298  
Another, albeit unlikely risk is to peer support specialists if patients have some negative outcome and 1299  
the peer blames themselves for this outcome. For example, if a patient is very distressed during an 1300  
exposure therapy assignment and subsequently drinks alcohol and drives and is arrested or has  a 1301

 crash, the peer may blame him or herself for this negative outcome. To address this, the PI stresses in 1302  
his training of peers that their responsibility is limited to themselves with respect to showing up at 1303  
exposure assignments as a workout buddy, and t hat any negative behaviors on the part of the peer 1304  
would very likely have occurred, and occurred with greater severity had they not been involved and 1305  
helping.  1306  
 1307  
Social risks are present if another person or parties observe participants attending treatment c linics or 1308  
learn by other means of participants receiving treatment. Participants will not be overtly identified as 1309  
research candidates or candidates for psychological intervention. Participants in mental health research 1310  
at the VAMC are NOT required to ‘che ck in’ at the mental health front desk, and instead report directly 1311  
to treatment areas in order to reduce any potential for stigma.  1312  
 1313  
Legal risks arise if individuals are homicidal or suicidal and make these intentions known to project 1314  
staff, which are then  required to notify authorities and the target of homicidal intent. These risks are 1315  
outlined in the informed consent documents.  1316  
 1317  
Risk Management and Emergency Response . In the event respondents experience extreme 1318  
psychological distress secondary to partici pation, they will be encouraged to telephone the Principal 1319  
Investigator (PI) or the Co -Investigators. In addition, they will have access to the VA’s urgent care 1320  
services. Any adverse effects noted by any project personnel in response, or in potential respo nse to 1321  
any project intervention, assessment protocol, or study involvement will be immediately reported to the 1322  
PI and Project Co -Is, who will then report these serious adverse effects in writing to the University/VA 1323  
IRB within 24 hours of the initial repor t. The research team is comprised of licensed clinical 1324  
psychologists with extensive experience working with adults who have experienced significant life 1325  
stressors. Participants will be requested at the beginning and the end of the initial interview session  to 1326  
write down the PI’s name and telephone number. Moreover, if assessors or project staff believe that a 1327  
participant is significantly distressed by participation, the PI will be notified and will contact the 1328  
participant to assess distress and assure parti cipant safety. If called by participants, the PI will attempt 1329  
to address all subject concerns and set up an alternate referral for counseling for those who desire it 1330  
from outside the project.  1331  
 1332  
In any study of mental health problems or symptoms, risk of sui cide is amplified relative to most other 1333  
medical disorders. Therefore, specific precautions will be taken to prevent harm to participants and 1334  
potential participants. All assessors will be specifically trained to assess suicide risk (e.g., suicide 1335  
verbaliza tions, extreme sadness, etc.) associated with major depressive disorder, and the structured 1336  
clinical interview will specifically query for both suicidal ideation and intent. In initial screening 1337  
procedures, participants identified by clinical interview wit h both suicidal ideation and acute intent will 1338  
be excluded from the study, but will be offered emergency psychiatric care immediately. This care is 1339  
available 24 hours per day at the Charleston VAMC emergency room. In any instance where ideation 1340  
or intent i s identified, a Project Investigator will be immediately notified and will contact the participant 1341  
for further evaluation. If both ideation and intent are present, the aforementioned hospital intervention 1342  
will be provided.  1343  
 1344  
Thus, all assessment points repr esent suicide risk identification, assessment, and intervention 1345  
opportunities. In addition, all project therapists will be specifically trained regarding the increased risk 1346

 of suicide in depressed persons and will receive specific instruction of suicide ri sk assessment by 1347  
Project Investigators.  1348  
 1349  
In any instance (either during assessments or during treatment sessions) where suicide risk is 1350  
identified: (1) a Project Investigator will immediately contact the participant and determine suicide risk. 1351  
(a) If suic idal ideation, but not intent is present, the individual will be retained in the study and assessed 1352  
for suicide risk by one of the Investigators in one week. (b) In cases of acute suicidal intent, state law 1353  
requires immediate hospitalization and we will fo llow these guidelines. Note, as mentioned, suicidal 1354  
ideation is not grounds for study exclusion or mandatory hospitalization, whereas clear intent to commit 1355  
suicide requires hospitalization.  1356  
 1357  
Potential Benefits . The benefit to the volunteer is a potential  reduction in aversive psychological 1358  
symptoms of anxiety and depression, as well as the cognitive realization that, through their volunteer 1359  
efforts, they are helping to advance the state of knowledge as it applies to positive mental health for 1360  
Veterans. Th e benefit is (1) reducing attrition from the military due to mental health causes and (2) 1361  
reducing eventual mental health costs for the VAMC system, thereby benefiting individuals and the VA. 1362  
Another benefit is to the peer support specialist, who may be pa rticularly happy to ‘give back’ to other 1363  
Veterans.  1364  
 1365  
8.2. Alternatives. Mental health treatment is available, including various forms of psychotherapy and 1366  
drug treatments . Military personnel  may be eligible for care at one of the Veterans Healthcare System 1367  
facilities or clinics . If not, they will be instructed that they can request treatment for PTSD through Army 1368  
One-Source. Not participating in the study is also an alternative.  1369  
 1370  
 1371  
9.0. ADVERS E EVENTS, UNANTICIPATED PROBLEMS, AND DEVIATIONS  1372  
 1373  
9.1. Adverse Events.  All adverse events  will be assessed and monitored according to the established 1374  
SOP and the IRB of record’s policies and procedures.  1375  
 1376  
9.2.  Reporting Adverse Events, Unanticipated Problems Involving Risks to Subjects or Others 1377  
(UPIRSOs), and Deviations  to the Office of the IRB. All adverse events, unanticipated problems 1378  
involving risk to participants or others, and deviations will be reporte d to the Institutional Review Board 1379  
(IRB) in accordance with current IRB policy . UPIRSOs and recurrent non -compliance with study 1380  
procedures will be reported promptly to the IRB . All adverse events that do not meet the UPIRSO 1381  
criteria and deviations that ar e not non -compliance will be summarized at Continuing Review per the 1382  
IRB of record’s policy .  1383  
 1384  
9.3. Research Monitor . Tataina Davidson, Ph.D . 1385  
 1386  
Responsibilities of the Research Monitor . The research  monitor is required to review all 1387  
unanticipated problems involving risk to volunteers or others, serious adverse events and all volunteer 1388  
deaths associated with the protocol and provide an unbiased written report of the event to the 1389  
USAMRMC Office of Rese arch Protections (ORP) Human Research Protection Office (HRPO). At a 1390  
minimum the research  monitor should comment on the outcomes of the event or problem and in the 1391  
case of a serious adverse event or death comment on the relationship to participation in the  study. The 1392

 Page 32 of 36 
 medical monitor should also indicate whether he/she concurs with the details of the report provided by 1393  
the study investigator. Reports for events determined by either the investigator or medical monitor to 1394  
be possibly or definitely related to p articipation and reports of events resulting in death should be 1395  
promptly forwarded to the HRPO.  Additional responsibilities include :  1396  
 1397  
• observe recruitment and enrollment procedures and the consent process for individuals, groups 1398  
or units;  1399  
• oversee study int erventions and interactions;  1400  
• may discuss the research protocol with the investigators, interview human subjects, and consult 1401  
with others outside of the study about the research;  1402  
• reviewing monitoring plans and UPIRTSO reports;  1403  
• overseeing data matching, da ta collection, and analysis  1404  
• shall have authority to stop a research protocol in progress, remove individual human subjects 1405  
from a research protocol, and take whatever steps are necessary to protect the safety and well - 1406  
being of human subjects until the IRB can assess the monitor’s report;  1407  
• shall have the responsibility to promptly report their observations and findings to the IRB or other 1408  
designated official and the HRPO.  1409  
 1410  
 1411  
10.0. WITHDRAWAL FROM STUDY PARTICIPATION    1412  
 1413  
Participation in the study may be discontinued by the principal investigator if continued participation is 1414  
considered a danger to a participant’s welfare. Reasons for discontinuation can include: 1) serious 1415  
adverse event; 2) clinical worsening for any reason that is deemed to necessitate n on-study 1416  
psychological or psychiatric treatment; 3) exacerbation of PTSD, anxiety, or depressive symptoms that 1417  
the participant cannot tolerate; or 4) discontinuation would be in the participant's best interest. 1418  
Participants deemed candidates for discontinu ation will be discussed with the therapist and the 1419  
supervisor and will be brought to the attention of the PI for final decision .  1420  
 1421  
Participants who are discontinued from the study for any reason will be scheduled for a final evaluation 1422  
within one week and given appropriate treatment referrals. If participants are discontinued due to a 1423  
serious adverse event, they will continue to be followed clinically by the therapist and/or member of the 1424  
research staff until the adverse event is resolved or becomes stable.  If participants are discontinued for 1425  
a medical or psychiatric reason, they will be given the opportunity to either complete the balance of 1426  
their PE sessions or to receive a full course of PE after the condition has resolved or stabilized and the 1427  
endpoint assessment has been completed . The reason the participants are discontinued from the study 1428  
and any referrals made will be documented . Participants will be told they will be contacted for post - 1429  
treatment assessments whether or not they complete the trial.  1430

 We do not anticipate that this will be a greater than minimal risk study necessitating the use of the 1435  
Volunteer Registry Database will be necessary.  1436

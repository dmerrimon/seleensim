2. BACKGROUND  
 
2.1.Brain Metastases  
Brain metastases are the most common intracranial tumors and o ccur in approximately 
25% of patients with cancer [1].  In the U.S., approximately 170,000 cancer patients a year 
are diagnosed with brain metastases [2].  Likely as a result of improvements in systemic 
treatments, the incidence of intracranial metastases has increased over the past decade [3].  
The most common malignancies to spread to the brain are lung, breast, kidney, 
colon/rectum, and melanoma.  Clinically, patients with brain metastases can present with 
headache,  neurologic deficits, cognitive dysfunction, seizures, or stroke.  Diagnosis is 
made with neuro -imaging.   
 
The prognosis of patients with brain metastases is variable and depends on several factors, 
including performance status, age, control of the primar y tumor, and extent of extracranial 
disease [4].  Historically, patients with brain metastases who receive supportive care only 
have median survival of 1 to 2 months.  However, a subgroup of patients with favorable 
prognosis who undergo treatment can enjoy an extended life expectancy with median 
survival of 10 to 16 months [5, 6] .  Treatment  options for brain metastases include medical 
management, surgery, and radiation.  Surgery and radiation will be discussed further.     
 
2.2.Surgery  
Surgery has an important role in management of brain metastases.  In patients with a large 
tumor causing mass effect, surgical resection can provide rapid relief of symptoms.  
Moreover, surgery followed by conventional whole brain radiation (WBRT) decreases 
local recurrence and improves median survival compared to WBRT alone [7].  In our study, 
patients deemed suitab le for surgery will undergo upfront surgical resection followed by 
 
11 of 34  
 radiosurgery to the resection cavity.  
 
2.3.Neurocognitive Effects of Whole Brain Radiotherapy  
Radiation therapy can be delivered using 1) conventional fractionated radiation to treat the 
whole  brain (WB RT), 2) stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) to treat individual metastases, or 
3) both.    
 
WBRT is associated with a short -term decline in quality of life and long -term deficits in 
neurocognitive function [8, 9] .  In conventionally fractionated WBRT, radiation to the 
whole cranium is delivered in 10 to 20 daily treatments.  Late toxicity of WBRT, such as 
memory impairment and dementia, is usually irreversible and is likely due to 
demyelination, vascular damage, and necrosis.   Following WBRT, the actuarial rate of 
neurocognitive toxicity at 2 years can be up to 49% [10].  Meyers reported that 59% of the 
patients after WBRT demonstrated a greater than 2 standard deviation decline in their 
performance at 6 months [11].  Results from a recently prese nted phase III randomized trial 
reported WBRT to be linked to a marked decline in learning and memory function at 4 
months compared to SRS alone (49% vs. 23%, respectively).    
2.4.Stereotactic Radiosurgery  
Unlike WBRT, stereotactic radiosurgery  has the advant age of sparing normal brain .  In 
SRS,  high energy radiation is precisely directed at the target lesion.  Due to the steep fall –
off of the radiation dose away from the target, relative sparing of the normal brain is 
possible.  To minimize the potential late  effects of WBRT, investigators have explored the 
use of SRS alone, deferring the use of WBRT for salvage treatment if needed.  Both 
retrospective analyses [12-15] and a prospective randomized trial [16] reported no apparent 
survival benefit to combining WBRT with SRS compared to SRS alone.   
We have recently published a retrospecti ve review of patients with brain metastases treated 
with surgical resection followed by adjuvant SRS to the resection cavity while deferring 
WBRT for salvage.  Actuarial local control rates at 6 and 12 months were 88% and 79%, 
respectively.  This value com pares favorably with historic results with observation alone 
(54%) and postoperative WBI (80 -90%) [17].  Given its negative neurocognitive effects in 
the absence of survival benefit, it is our current practice to omit WBRT in favor of SRS in 
patients with limited number of brain metastases.   
2.5.Large Brain Metastases  
Neither WBRT  nor SRS has been shown to adequately control large brain metastases.  
WBRT  has been shown to have less than 5% complete response rate with brain metastases 
larger than 2 cm [18].  Radiation Therapy Oncology Group ( RTOG ) 90-05 study 
determined maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and subsequent dose se lection guidelines for 
single  fraction radiosurgery  in patients with recurrent brain metastases who had received 
prior partial or whole brain irradiation [19].  The MTD for metastases < 2cm, 2 -3 cm and 
 
12 of 34  
 3-4 cm were not reached, 24, and 18 Gy, respectively.  Based on these results, the 
recommended single  fraction radiosurgery dose for brain metastases of <2 cm, 2 -3 cm, and 
3-4 cm are 24 Gy,  18 Gy, and 15 Gy, respectively .  However, subsequent reports on the 
usage of these dosing guidelines show a local control of only 49% and 45% for metastases 
2-3 cm and 3 -4 cm in diameter , respectively [20].   Similarly, a series from Pittsburgh 
showed only a 49% local control rate for tumors >4 cc (appr oximately >2 cm 
diameter) [21].  The im portance of controlling brain metastases is demonstrated by the 
significant decline in neurocognitive function in those patients with disease progression 
compared to those with controlled disease [11].  Given the negative impact of recurrent 
intracranial disease on  the quality of life and neurocognitive ability of patients, a great need 
exists for the improvement of local control in patients with large brain metastases .   
 
2.6.Fractionated Radiosurgery  
One technique which may improve local control and toxicity profile is fractionation of SRS 
treatments.  Fractionatio n has been demonstrated to increase tumor kill by allowing  inter-
fraction re -oxygen ation and cell reassortment to minimize radioresistance due to hypoxia 
and cell cycle [22].  In addition, fractionation reduces the late effects of radiotherapy.  
 
Despite the widespread use of frac tionated radiosurgery, no prospective data exist to 1) 
provide dose guidelines, 2) determine whether fractionation of SRS improves local control, 
and 3) examine the effects of fractionation on acute and late side effects.    
The protocol outline here propo ses SRS to be delivered in 3 fractions with initial dose of 
24 Gy in 3 fractions  (i.e., 8 Gy x 3 fractions) for brain metastases  4.2 - 14.1 cm3 (2 – 3 cm 
diameter) and for metastases 14.2 - 33.5 cm3 (3 - 4 cm diameter).  This dose is 
radiobiologically equi valent to 16 Gy in a single fraction .  This conservative dose of 24 Gy 
in 3 fractions is below or similar to the MTD for single  fraction SRS determined in the 
RTOG 90 -05 in patients who had already received previous brain irradiation.

13 of 34  
 3.1.4.  Patient must exhibit the ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written 
informed consent.  
3.1.5.  Life expectancy of at least 12  weeks.  
3.2 Exclusion Criteria  
 
3.2.1.  Patients who have previously been treated with whole brain irradiation . 
3.2.2.  Patients whose metastatic lesion in question had previously been treated with SRS.  
3.2.3.  The patient has greater than 4 total brain metastases at the time of initial evaluation.  
3.2.4.  Pediatric patients (age <18), pregnant women, and patients who are unable to give 
informed consent will be excluded.  
 
3.3       Informed Consent Process  
 
3.3.1 Informed consent may be obtained by the PI or a designee who is a member of the 
research team.  
3.3.2 The PI is ultimately responsible for determining whether a subject has the 
capacity to consent,  although informed consent may be obtained by either the PI 
or designee. If the subject is lacking  such capacity, whether due to cognitive 
impairment, the subject’s age, or other causes, the  PI/designee may obtain consent 
from a legally authorized representative.  
3.3.3 As part of the consent process, the subject’s or his/her representative’s questions 
must be answered  prior to consent being given and throughout the study. The 
subject or his/her representative should  be asked if there are any questions prior to 
consent being obtained and at all subsequent visits or  contacts. These elements of 
the informed consent process must be documented in the patient’s  medical record.  
3.3.4 When giving the consent, the subject or a duly authorized legal representative 
needs to read each  page and sign and date the last page of the form along with the 
investigator or designee obtaining  consent.  
3.3.5 The signed Informed Cons ent Form should be f iled in the following location.  
3.3.5.1  The signed consent will be filed in the patient’s research study record.  
3.3.5.2  One copy of the signed consent will be sent to Stanford Medical Records 
where it will  be scanned into the patient’s electronic medical record.  
3.3.5.3  An additional copy of the consent form will be filed in the study Regulatory 
Binder.  
 
3.4       Randomization Procedures  
 
This is not a randomized trial.  There will be no randomization.  
  
 
 
14 of 34  
 4. TREATMENT PLAN  
 
4.1 Investigational Agent or Device  Administration  
4.1.1.  PRETREATMENT EVALUATIONS  
Patients will be evaluated by a multi -disciplinary team composed of radiation 
oncologists and neurosurgeons  to assess for their eligibility .  Patient’s oncologic 
history, presenting symptoms, physical examination, pathology, and imaging studies 
will be reviewed.  Patients will be evaluated for surgical candidacy and resectability.   
  
4.1.2.  SURGICAL TREATMENT  
Patients who are good surgical candidates, as determ ined by neurosurgical evaluation, 
will undergo a surgical resection prior to radiotherapy.  All others will receive primary 
SRS.  
 
4.1.3.  RADIATION THERAPY  
4.1.3.1. Dose specifications/escalation  
SRS will be delivered in 3 fractions .  Provided that the MTD has not been rea ched , 
the total dose will be increased in 3 Gy increments :   
 
Dose Level  Dose Per Fraction  Total Dose  
1 8 Gy  24 Gy  
2 9 Gy  27 Gy  
3 10 Gy  30 Gy  
4 11 Gy  33 Gy  
 
A minimum of s ix patients will be enrolled per arm :   
 
Arm   
1 4.2 - 14.1 cm3 brain metastasis  following surgical resection  
2 14.2 - 33.5 cm3 brain metastasis following surgical resection  
  
  
 
Similar to RTOG 90 -05, the dose limiting toxicity (DLT) is defined as grade 3, 4, 
or 5 RTOG central nervous system (CNS) acute radiation morbidity scoring criteria 
(Appendix C) observed within 30 days of radiosurgery.  The MTD is defined as 
one dose level below the highest toxic dose (i.e., the DLT dose).  
 
The occurrence of late toxicities will be continuously monitored. If a late DLT occurs in 3 
or more out of 6 (or 4 or more out of 12)  patients at a certain dose level after the radiation 
dose had already been escalated to the next level, the MTD will be backtracked to the level 
 
15 of 34  
 below the one at which the DLTs occurred.  
 
 
Does escalation will proceed as follows, with minimum waiting period of 30 days 
before proceeding with the next higher dose level:  
 
Numbe r of Patients at a Given 
Dose Level with a DLT  Escalation Decision Rule  
0-1 out of 6  Enter 6 patients at the next higher dose level  
2 out of 6  
 
 
  Enter at least 6 more patients at the current dose level.  
 If 0-1 of these 6 experience a DLT (i.e., 2 -3 
out of 12), then proceed to next dose level.  
 If 2 or more of these 6 experience a DLT (4 or 
more out of 12), then dose escalation will be 
stopped.  Six additional patients will be 
entered at the next lower dose level if only 6 
patients were previously entered . 
3 or more out of 6  Dose escalation will be stopped. Six additional 
patients will be entered at the next lower dose level if 
only 6 patients were previously entered.  
 
Should a patient not be evaluable at 30 days (due to death or loss to follow -up or 
discontinuation of the protocol follow -up per patient preference), then additional patients 
may be enrolled on each arm such that at least 5 of 6 are evaluable and experience no DLT.  
For example, should one patie nt be lost to follow up, but the remaining 5 patients have no 
DLT, then dose escalation may proceed.  
 
4.1.3.2. Technical factors  
Treatment shall be delivered using the Trilogy™ Linear Accelerator (Varian Medical 
Systems, Palo Alto, CA) or the CyberKnife™ Robotic Radiosurgery System (Accuray, 
Sunnyvale, CA).  
 
4.1.3.3. Localization, simulation, and immobilization  
The patient shall be treated in the supine position.  An aquaplast head mask will be used 
to ensure adequate immobilization during therapy.  The target volume shall  be either the 
resection cavity or the unresectable lesion.  When the resection cavity is targeted, a 
uniform  isotropic  2 mm expansion of the cavity will be the target volume [17]. 
 
4.1.3.4. Critical structures  
 
16 of 34  
 Critical normal structures (e.g., optic apparatus, brain stem) will be contoured and their  
doses minimized.   The patient will be excluded from the protocol if the tumor’s proximity 
to critical structures is such that a dosimetrically acceptable plan is not achievable to 
conform to these constraints.  
 
 
4.2  General Concomitant Medication and Supportive Care Guidelines  
 
Supportive treatment may include anti -emetics, anti -diarrheal medications, anti -
pyretics, anti -histamines, analgesics, antibiotics, and others, such as blood products.  
Patients will be permitted to receive appropriate supportive care measures as deemed 
necessary by the treating physician.  
Steroids may be given after each SRS treatment to decrease the risk of CNS symptoms 
due to cerebral edema.  In addition, s teroids may be used as required to control CNS 
symptoms due to  tumor -associated or RT -associated  cerebral edema, but wherever 
possible, should be tapered and stopped.  
 
Nausea/vomiting:  Nausea and vomiting  should be treated aggressively . In particular, 
the use of antiemetics including 5HT3 antagonists and/or dexamet hasone is 
encouraged. Patients should be strongly encouraged to maintain liberal oral fluid 
intake during therapy.  
 
4.3  Duration of Therapy  
 
SRS will be given in 3 fractions, each approximately 24 hours apart.  
 
4.4  Duration of Follow Up  
 
Follow -up schedule is summarized in section 9. Study Calendar.  
Patients will be seen in follow -up at 1st, 3rd, 6th, 9th, and 12th months following radiation.  
The following will be obtained at pre -treatment evaluation and at each follow -up time 
point :  Neurologic history and physical examination, KPS, steroid use assessment, and 
toxicity evaluation.  MRI with gadolinium will be obtained at pre -treatment and at 3, 
6, 9, and 12 months following treatment until progression is documented and 
continuing ev ery 3 months for those without evidence of intracranial progression.   
After the first 12 months, patients will be followed every 3 -6 months  at the discretion 
of the patient’s physician .  At each visit, interval history, physical exam, KPS, toxicity 
evalua tion, and brain MRI scans will be obtained.  
For those subjects who are unable to come for clinic visits, clinical follow -up 
information will be obtained via 1) a phone call to the patient and/or 2) clinic source 
document from his/her local physician.  For subjects unable to appear in person for 
clinic visits, HRQOL questionnaires will be completed via a telephone interview or 
mail.  
 
 
17 of 34  
 For patients unable to return for imaging studies, source documents from outside 
institutions will be used to document imaging  follow -up.   
 
 
 
4.5 Criteria for Removal from Study  
 
 Disease progression or death  
 Intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of treatment:  a condition, 
injury, or disease unrelated to cancer, that renders continuing of radiation 
treatment unsafe or regular study visits impossible.   
 Unacceptable adverse event(s) (see adverse events)  
 Patient decides to withdraw from the study  
 General or specifi c changes in the patient’s condition that render the patient 
ineligible for the study  
 Non-compliance with protocol -required evaluations and study visits  
 Inability of subject to comply with study requirements  
 Determination by the investigator that it is no longer safe for the subject to 
continue therapy  
 Patients who inadvertently become pregnant   
 At the discretion of the treating investigators  
 
Subjects who are discontinued from the study will still be followed for disease 
progression and survival.  
 
Subjects who discontinue should, if possible, be seen and assessed by an 
investigator(s). The reason for withdrawal and the date of withdrawal must be 
documented.   
 
If the reason for withdrawal from the trial is the death of the subject, the two  options 
for categorizing withdrawal are either progressive disease or an adverse event (AE; 
more than one AE may be documented as a reason for withdrawal).  Only one event 
will be captured as the cause of death.  Note that death is an outcome and not an AE.  
 
All t rial treatment -related toxicities and serious adverse events ( SAEs ) must be 
followed up until resolution.  
 
At withdrawal, all on -going study -related toxicities and SAEs must be followed until 
resolution, unless in the investigator’s opinion, the condition is unlikely to resolve due 
to the subject’s underlying disease.   
 
Subjects/patients who discontinue from the study for reasons unrelated to the study 
(e.g., personal reasons, or adverse events after registration but prior to receiving study 
therapy) may b e replaced as required for the study to meet its objectives.  The decision 
 
18 of 34  
 to remove a subject/patient and to replace dropouts will be made by the treating 
investigator.  The replacement will generally receive the same treatment or treatment 
sequence (as a ppropriate) as the allocation number replaced.  
4.6  Alternatives  
 
Alternative treatments include conventional fractionated whole brain radiotherapy, 
stereotactic radiosurgery alone, systemic therapy, or no therapy.  
 
4.7  Compensation  
 
Subjects will not be paid for their participation in the study.

19 of 34  
  
7.2 Adverse Event Reporting  
 
In the event of an adverse event the first concern will be for the safety of the subject.  
Appropriate medical, psychological and/or supportive intervention should be initiated 
as soon as possible.  All subjects/patients with serious adverse experiences mu st be 
followed up for outcome.  
 
7.2.1.  Definition:  
7.2.1.1. Definition of adverse event:   any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, 
or disease temporally associated with the use of a medical treatment or 
procedure regardless of whether it is considered related to the medical treatment 
or procedure (attribution of unrelated, unlikely, poss ible, probable, or definite).   
7.2.1.2. Definition of serious adverse event:   any adverse experience that results in 
any of the following outcome: death, a life -threatening experience, inpatient 
hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, a persis tent or 
significant disability/incapacity, or a congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life threatening, or 
require hospitalization may be considered a serious adverse event when, based 
upon medical judg ment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may 
require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed 
in this definition.  
7.2.1.3. Definition of unanticipated problems involving risks to participants or 
others (UPs):    events (incl uding internal or external events, death, life -
threatening experiences, injuries, breaches of confidentiality, or other 
problems) that occur any time during or after the research study, which in the 
opinion of the PD are:  
7.2.1.4. Unexpected - not in the consent f orm, protocol, package insert, or label; or 
unexpected in its frequency, severity, or specificity, AND  
7.2.1.5. Related to the research procedures – caused by, or probably caused by research 
activity, or, if a device is involved, probably caused by , or associated with the 
device, AND  
7.2.1.6. Harmful – caused harm to participants or others, or placed them at increased 
risk of harm (including physical, psychological, economic, or social harm.  
 
20 of 34  
 7.2.1.7. Definition of reportable information:  New information that indicates a 
change to t he risks or potential benefits of the research, in terms of severity or 
frequency.  
7.2.1.7.1.  Protocol deviation or violation, o nly if:  
7.2.1.7.1.1. Intended to eliminate apparent immediate hazard to a research 
participant, or  
7.2.1.7.1.2. Harmful (caused harm to participants or to others, or  placed them at 
increased risk of harm – including physical, psychological, 
economic, or social harm), or  
7.2.1.7.1.3. Possible serious or continued noncompliance  
7.2.1.7.2.  Complaint that is unresolved by the research team, or that indicates 
increased or unexpected risks.  
7.2.1.7.3.  Incarc eration when in the opinion of the PD it is in the best interest of 
the participant to remain on the study.  
7.2.1.8. Unanticipated adverse device effect.   New information about the effect on 
health or safety or any life -threatening problem or death caused by, or 
associated with, a device, if that effect, problem, or death was not previously 
identified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence, or any oth er unanticipated 
serious problem associated with a device that relates to the rights, safety, or 
welfare or subjects.  
Changes resulting from normal growth and development which do not vary 
significantly in frequency or severity from expected levels are not  to be considered 
adverse experiences. Examples of this may include, but are not limited to, teething, 
typical crying in infants and children, and onset of menses or menopause occurring 
at a physiologically appropriate time.  
If disease progression is noted  during a protocol -specified reevaluation of the status 
of a patient’s cancer, and the progression is manifested solely by results of tumor 
markers and/or radiologic imaging, that occurrence of progressive disease will 
NOT be recorded as an adverse experie nce.    
 
7.2.2.  Adverse Event Reporting  
 
7.2.2.1. PIs or designees should report AEs, whether considered treatment related or 
not, to the CCTO Safety Coordinator per protocol and regulatory timeframes. 
 
21 of 34  
 Events  should be reported within 10 working days of becoming aware of the 
event (5 days if the event is  life-threatening or resulted in death).  
 
7.2.2.2. Unanticipated adverse device effects should be reported to FDA, CCTO and 
participating  investigators within 10 working days of becoming aware of the 
event (5 days if the event is life threatening  or resulted in death).  
 
7.2.2.3.  RTOG central nervous system (CNS) acute radiation morbidity scoring 
criteria (Appendix C) will be used to grade acute CNS toxicity.  
 
7.2.2.4.  The Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Even ts (CTCAE) version 4.0 
will be used for grading of adverse events (Appendix E).  
 
 
8. CORRELATIVE/SPECIAL STUDIES  
 
8.1.Dose heterogeneity and conformality within the target volume will be calculated for each 
lesion to investigate whether these factors have any correlation to local control or  toxicity . 
8.2.To identify potential predictors of response, the following pre -treatment tumor 
characteristics will be collected:  
8.2.1.  Lesion size  
8.2.2.  Histology  
8.2.3.  Pattern of enhancement on MRI scan  
8.2.4.  Presence or absence of extensive edema

10. MEASUREMENT OF EFFECT  
 
 
10.1 Anti -tumor Effect  
 
Subjects  will be seen in follow -up at 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months following SRS .At each 
follow -up, neurologic history and examination will be done.  MRI with gadolinium 
will be obtained  at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months .    
  
10.1.1  Definitions  
 
Early radiation toxicity is defined as those observed within 30 days of SRS.  Late 
radiation toxicity is defined as those observed after 30 days following SRS.  Tumor 
response will be measured using MRI with gadolinium obtained at 3 , 6, 9 and 12  
months following SRS.  
 
10.1.2  Disease Parameters  
 
Target lesion is defined as those treated with radiosurgery.  The size and volume 
of the target lesion will be measured using the treatment planning software .  
 
10.1.3  Methods for Evaluation of Measurable Disease  
 
MRI with gadolinium will be obtained at 3,  6, 9, and 12 months following SRS . 
 
10.1.4  Response Criteria  
 
10.1.4.1  Evaluation of Target Lesions  
 
Radiographic response using MRI with gadolinium will be used.  Follow -up MRI 
scans will be obtained at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months following SRS.  Size of the treated 
lesion will be measured and compared to its pre -treatment size .  Local tumor 
progression is defined as the radiographic appearance of a new or increasing 
enhancing lesion within the radiosurgical target volume.  Local control is defined as 
lack of progression (P – below).  Metabolic imaging may be necessary at times to 
distinguish tumor progression from treatment related radiation necrosis.   
4.1.3.4.1.  Complete response (CR):  The tumor is no longer seen on the follow -up 
MRI  scan.  
4.1.3.4.2.  Partial response (PR):  Decrease of >50% in the product of two 
diam eters on the follow -up MRI scan . 
 
23 of 34  
 4.1.3.4.3.  Minor response (MR): Decrease of <50% in the product of two 
diameters on the follow -up M RI scan . 
4.1.3.4.4.  Stable disease (SD):  The scan shows no change.  
4.1.3.4.5.  Progression (P):  A >25% increase in tumor area ( product of two 
diameters).  
 
10.1.4.2  Evaluation of Non -Target Lesions  
 
The distant control rate will be determined.   Distant brain failure is defined 
as the radiographic appearance of a new or enhancing lesi on more than  5 
mm from  the radiosurgical target volume [19].  Elsewhere brain failure rate 
will be determin ed using MRI scanning with gadolinium obtained at 3, 6, 
9, and 12 months following SRS.

10.1.5  Duration of Response  
 
 
N/A 
 
10.1.6  Progression -Free Survival (or other parameters)  
 
Time to progression will be measured from the time of SRS.  Overall survival will 
be measured from 1) the time of diagnosis, and 2) time of SRS.  
 
10.1.7  Response Review  
 
N/A 
 
10.2 Other Response Parameters  
 
The primary endpoint of this study is to determine the MTD of tri -fraction SRS.  The MTD 
is defined as one dose level below the highest toxic dose (i.e., the DLT dose).   Similar to 
RTOG 90 -05, the dose limiting toxicity (DLT) is defined as grade 3, 4, or 5  RTOG central 
nervous system (CNS) acute radiation morbidity scoring criteria (Appendix C) observed 
within 30 days of radiosurgery.   
The occurrence of late toxicities will be continuously monitored. If a late DLT occurs in 3 
or more out of 6 (or 4 or more  out of 12)  patients at a certain dose level after the radiation 
dose had already been escalated to the next level, the MTD will be backtracked to the level 
 
24 of 34  
 below the one at which the DLTs occurred.  
 
 
11. DATA REPORTING / REGULATORY CONSIDERATIONS  
 
11.1 Monitoring plan  
 
Stanford Cancer Center (SCC) Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) will be 
responsible for monitoring the research yearly and will operate independently from the 
clinical investigators . The primary responsibility of the DSMC is to re view the reported 
study data to confirm it is accurate, complete, and verifiable from source 
documents .  The DSMC will also confirm that the conduct of the trial maintains the 
safety and well being of human subjects, and is in compliance with the currently  
approved protocol, with GCP, and with applicable regulatory requirements .  Study 
safety data will be reviewed by the DSMC in the form of summary reports or data 
listings on a regular basis.  
 
11.2  Stopping rules (for the individual patient and for the study a s a whole)  
 
The dose limiting toxicity (DLT) is defined as grade 3, 4, or 5 RTOG central nervous 
system (CNS) acute radiation morbidity scoring criteria (Appendix C) observed within 30 
days of radiosurgery.     
The occurrence of late toxicities will be continuously monitored. If a late DLT occurs in 3 
or more out of 6 (or 4 or more out of 12)  patients at a certain dose level after the radiation 
dose had already been escalated to the next level, the MTD will be backtracked to the level 
below the one at w hich the DLTs occurred.  
 
 
Does escalation will proceed as follows:  
 
Number of Patients at a Given 
Dose Level with a DLT  Escalation Decision Rule  
0-1 out of 6  Enter 6 patients at the next higher dose level  
2 out of 6  
 
 
  Enter at least 6 more patients at the current dose level.  
 If 0-1 of these 6 experience a DLT (i.e., 2 -3 
out of 12), then proceed to next dose level.  
 If 2 or more of these 6 experience a DLT (4 or 
more out of 12), then dose escalation will be 
stopped.  Six additional patients will be 
entere d at the next lower dose level if only 6 
patients were previously entered.  
 
25 of 34  
 3 or more out of 6  Dose escalation will be stopped. Six additional 
patients will be entered at the next lower dose level if 
only 6 patients were previously entered.  
 
Should a patient not be evaluable at 30 days (due to death or loss to follow -up or 
discontinuation of the protocol follow -up per patient preference), then additional patients 
may be enrolled on each arm such that at least 5 of 6 are evaluable and experienc e no DLT.  
For example, should one patient be lost to follow up, but the remaining 5 patients have no 
DLT, then dose escalation may proceed.  
 
 11.3 Data management  
 
All data files (contains patients’ names, medical record numbers, treatment, and 
follow -up information) for this study will be kept in a secure office in the department 
of Neurosurgery and Radiation Oncology.  The electronic data file for this study, 
which contains patients’ names, medical record numbers, treatment, and follow -up 
information, is kept under password protection.  
 
 11.4 Confidentiality  
 
All signed informed consents and data files (contains patients’ names, medical record 
numbers, treatment, and follow -up information) for this study will be kept in a secure 
office in the department of Neurosurgery and Radiation Oncology.  The electronic 
data file for this study, which contains patients’ names, medical record numbers, 
treatment, and follow -up information, is kept under password protection.  
 
12. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 
12.1 Endpoints  
 
12.1.1  Primary endpoint  
 
Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of SRS given in 3 fractions for brain 
metastases 4.2 - 14.1 cm3 and 14.2 - 33.5 cm3. 
12.1.2  Secondary endpoints  
 
12.1.2.1. To determine the local control rate of fractionated SRS for brain metastases 
4.2 - 14.1 cm3 and 14.2 - 33.5 cm3. 
12.1.2.2. To determine the distant brain  control rate of fractionated SRS for brain 
metastases 4.2 - 14.1 cm3 and 14.2 - 33.5 cm3. 
12.1.2.3. To determine the overall survival  rate of fractionated SRS for brain metastases 
4.2 - 14.1 cm3 and 14.2 - 33.5 cm3. 
 
26 of 34  
 12.1.2.4. To determine the short - and long -term adverse effects  of fractionated SRS for 
brain metastases 4.2 - 14.1 cm3 and 14.2 - 33.5 cm3.   
12.1.2.5. Patient health related quality of life will be assessed using the EORTC QLQ -
C30 and EORTC Brain Cancer Module QLQ -BN20.  
 
12.2 Analysis Populations  
 
Each of the four arms will be analyzed separately to determine the MTD for each 
arm. 
 
Arm   
1 4.2 - 14.1 cm3 brain metastasis following surgical resection  
2 14.2 - 33.5 cm3 brain metastasis following surgical resection  
  
  
 
 
There will be no subset analysis.   
           
12.3 Sample Size  
 
12.3.1  Accrual estimates  
 
Six subjects  per group will be enrolled at the starting dose for each of the four arms.  
Should a patient not be evaluable at 30 days (due to death or loss to follow -up or 
discontinuation of the protocol follow -up per patient preference), then additional 
patients may be enrolled on each arm such that at least 5 of 6 experience no DLT.    
The maximum number of subjects  per arm will depend on the number of dose levels 
reached.  If all four dose levels are reached, the maximum number of evaluable 
subjects  in each  arm is 30 .  If all four dose levels are reached for the all two arms 
of the study, the maximum number of subjects for the entire study  is 60.  
  
12.3.2  Sample size justification  
 
The sample size will be determined by the number of dose levels reached.

Name of Active Ingredient:  Aflibercept  
Title of Study:  
A Phase III randomised, double -masked, parallel group, multicentre study to compare the efficacy, safety, 
pharmacokinetics, and immunogenicity between SB15 (proposed aflibercept biosimilar) and Eylea® in subjects 
with neovascular age -related macular degeneration  
Protocol No:  SB15- 3001  Phase: III 
Investigator  sites: Approximately 60 Investigator sites globally  
Planned Study Period: Approximately 59 weeks per subject  
Screening period will be 3 weeks . Investigational product (IP; SB15 or Eylea®) will be given for 48 weeks and 
the last assessment will be done at Week 56. 
Objectives:  
Primary objective  
The primary objective of this study is to  demonstrate the equivalence in efficacy of SB15  compared  to Eylea® 
in subjects with neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD).  
Secondary objective(s) 
The secondary objectives  are: 
• To evaluate the safety of SB15 compared to Eylea® 
• To evaluate the systemic exposure of SB15 compared to Eylea® in subjects participating in 
pharmacokinetics (PK) evaluation  
• To evaluate the immunogenicity of SB15 compared to Eylea® 
Study Design: 
This is a randomised, double -masked, parallel group, multicentre study to evaluate the efficacy, safety, PK, and 
immunogenicity of SB15 compared to Eylea® in subjects with neovascular AMD. Subjects will be randomised 
in a 1:1 ratio to receive either SB15 or Eylea® (administered via intravitreal [ IVT] injection  2 mg [0.05 mL] 
every 4 weeks  for the first 3 months  (i.e., at Weeks 0, 4, and 8) , followed by 2 mg [0.05 mL] once every 8 
weeks). At Week 32, subjects in Eylea® treatment group will be randomised again  in a 1:1  ratio to either 
continue on Eylea® treatment or be transitioned to SB15 treatment.  In the 8 -week treatment cycle, IPs ( SB15 
or Eylea®) will be administered up to Week 48, and the last assessment will be  done at  Week 56, corresponding 
to the end of follow -up for all subjects.  
Number of Subjects : 
Approximately a total of 446 subjects will be randomised in this study . 
Target Population:  Subjects with neovascular AMD  
Eligibility Criteria:  
Only one eye will be designated as the study eye. For subjects who meet eligibility criteria in both eyes, the 
eye with the worse visual acuity will be selected as the study eye. If both eyes have equal visual acuity , the eye

Statistical Methods   
Analysis sets for efficacy analyses  
The Full Analysis Set (FAS) consists of all randomised subjects. Following the intent- to-treat principle, 
subjects will be analysed according to the treatment group they are assigned to at randomisation. However, 
subjects who do not have any efficacy asse ssment result after randomisation and do not receive IP during 
the study period will be excluded from FAS.  
Per-Protocol Set (PPS) consists of all FAS subjects who have BCVA assessment result at baseline and at 
Week 8 without any major protocol deviations ( PDs) that have impact on the BCVA assessment. Major PDs 
that will lead to exclusion from this set will be pre -defined prior to unmasking the treatment group

assignment for analyses.  
Efficacy analyse s 
The primary efficacy analysis will aim to demonstrate equivalence in terms of change from baseline in BCVA 
at Week 8 between SB15 and Eylea®.  
The equivalence between the two treatment groups will be declared if the 90% confidence interval (CI) of 
the diff erence is entirely contained within the pre -defined equivalence margin of [−3 letters, 3 letters] . The 
90% CI of the difference between the two treatment groups in relation to the change from baseline in BCVA 
at Week 8 will be estimated for the FAS. The same analysis will be performed for the PPS as a sensitivity 
analysis.   
For the European Medicines Agency (EMA)  submission, equivalence between the two treatment groups will 
be declared if the 95% CI of the difference is entirely contained within the pre- defined equivalence margin 
of [−3 letters, 3 letters]. The 95% CI of the difference between the two treatment gro ups in relation to the 
change from baseline in BCVA at Week 8 will be estimated for the FAS. The same analysis will be performed 
for the PPS as a sensitivity analysis.  For those subjects who drop out of the study prematurely, a multiple 
imputation will be used under the missing at random assumption. The 95% CI of the difference between the 
two treatment groups will also be estimated for the FAS as supportive analysis.  
As the secondary efficacy endpoints, change from baseline in BCVA, CST, TRT , and CNV  area will be 
summarised descriptively by treatment group and visit.  
Proportion of subjects who lost fewer than 15 letters and gained 15 letters or more in BCVA compared to 
baseline, subjects with  intra- or sub-retinal fluid, and subjects with active CNV leakag e will be summarised 
descriptively by treatment group and visit.  
The two -sided 95% CI of the Least Square mean ( LSMean ) difference of change from baseline in secondary 
efficacy endpoints between the two treatment groups will be estimated.  
Safety analyses  
All reported terms for A Es (ocular or non-ocular ) will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory 
Activities (MedDRA®). AEs including ocular A Es in the study eye and/or fellow eye as well as non-ocular 
AEs will be summarised descriptively by trea tment group.  
Changes in vital signs and clinical laboratory parameters will be summarised descriptively by treatment group and visit. All other safety variables will be summarised descriptively by treatment group and visit 
unless specified otherwise.  
PK analyses  
Blood sampl es for PK assessment will be collected in approximately 40 subjects participating in PK 
evaluation (20 subjects per treatment group  in initial randomisation at Week 0 [Day 1] ). The systemic 
exposure will be summarised descriptively by t reatment group and visit. 
Immunogenicity analyses  
The number and proportion of subjects with ADA and N Ab results (e.g., ‘positive ’ or ‘negative ’) will be 
summarised descriptively by treatment group and visit. 
Exploratory analyses  
Proportion of subjects with sub -RPE fluid on OCT at Week 32 and Week 56 will be summarised descriptively

by treatment group and visit.  
For NEI VFQ -25 as a measurement of QOL, subscale scores (general health, general vision, ocular pain, 
near activities, distance activities, vision -specific social functioning, vision -specific mental health, vision -
specific role difficulties, vision -specific dependency, driving, colour vision, and peripheral vision) and the 
composite score, which represent overall visual function, will be calculated, and the change from baseline 
will be summaris ed descriptively by treatment group and visit. 
Sample size calculation  
For the calculation of the equivalence margin for BCV A, the mean changes in BCVA were referred from VIEW1 study of Eylea
® in subjects with neovascular AMD.  
In the VIEW1 study , as reported in  the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) of Eylea®, the mean 
change of BCV A at Month 12 (standard deviation [SD]) was 10.9 (13.8) letters for the dosing of 2 mg every 
4 weeks  in the Eylea® treatment group and the LSM ean difference between Eylea® and Lucentis® 
(ranibizumab) with its 95% CI was 3.15 (0.92, 5.37) let ters. 
The United States of America (US) Food and Drug Administration  (FDA ) Guidance describes that if the 
active control (Eylea® in this  study) has shown superiority to other active treatments (Lucentis® in VIEW1) 
in the past, the difference demonstrated (3.15 letters) represents a conservative estimate of historical evidence of sensitivity to drug -effects, one that could serve as a basis for choosing M1. Therefore, the equivalence 
margin of 3 letters  was chosen as it  would be less than the LS Mean difference in VIEW1 study,  which  proved 
statistical superiority to ranibizumab.  
The ETDRS chart has 5 letters in one line (that is the minimum limit, in terms of number of letters,  for 
detecting a  visual acuity c hange) ; thus, the difference of more than 5 letters in BCVA could be considered as 
a minimal clinically important difference. In addition, m ost of the anti -VEGF non -inferiority clinical trials 
on AMD also used a non -inferiority margin of 5 letters . Therefo re, the equivalence margin of [−3 letters, 3 
letters] is considered to be a conservative margin to test the clinical equivalence between SB15 and Eylea
®. 
With the equivalence limit of [−3 letters, 3 letters], a sample size of 216 subjects per treatment group was 
calculated with the assumptions of the mean difference of 0.5 letters and SD of 9.0 at the overall 5% 
significance level, providing 80% power to reject the null hypothesis. Overall 446 subjects (223 per  treatment 
group) will be randomi sed into the study , allowing 3% loss from the randomised subjects , if any.

AE = adverse event; BCVA = best corrected visual acuity; EOS = end of study; EOT = end of treatment; ET = early termination; FA = fluorescein angiography; FP = fundus photography; IP =  
investigational product; NEI VFQ -25 = National Eye Institute 25-item Visual Function Questionnaire; OCT = optical coherence tomography; PK = pharmacokinetics.  
 
1.  Written informed consent must be obtained from the subject prior to any study related procedures.  
2.  Demographic data includes the date of birth (year of birth is required ), gender, race, and ethnicity.  
3.  Physical examination will be performed at Screening and Week 56 (EOS visit) or ET visit. Body weight will be measured and recorded at Screening and Week 56 (EOS visit) or ET visit, 
whereas height will be measured and recorded only at Screening.  
4.  All subjects ’ eligibility should be confirmed by the central reading centre and the  Investigator  prior to randomisation. 
5.  At Week 32, subjects in Eylea® treatment group will be randomised in a 1:1 ratio to either continue on Eylea® treatment or be transitioned to SB15 treatment . Subjects receiving SB15 will 
continue to receive SB15 up to Week 48, but they will also follow the randomisation procedure  in order to maintain masking.  
6.  Vital signs include blood pressure, pulse  rate, and body temperature. Vital signs will be assessed at Screening and prior to intravitreal (IVT) injection of IP at each visit until Week 48. Vital 
signs will also be assessed at Week 56 (EOS visit) or ET visit.  
7.  Visual acuity will be assessed in both the study eye and fellow (non-study) eye at Screening and prior to IVT injection of IP at each visit until Week 48. V isual acuity  will also be assessed 
during the  final visit at Week 56 (EOS visit) or ET visit. Subject must use either original series Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopat hy Study (ETDRS) chart or 2702 series Number chart (at a 
starting distance of 4 meters) consistently from Screening to Week 56 (EOS visit) or ET visit. Visual acuity  testing must be performed before dilation of pupils  and other ophthalmic procedures 
including FA/FP and OCT assessment . A decreas e in visual acuity of ≥ 15 letters from  the last assessment of VA should be reported as A Es/serious A Es (SAEs) as appropriate. If there is a 
decrease in visual acuity  of ≥ 30 letters from  the last assessment of visual acuity  or if there is a decrease in visual acuity  to the level of light perception or worse, it should be reported as SAE.  
8.  The Investigator must confirm that the subject can read between 73 letters and 34 letters , inclusive,  in the study eye using original series ETDRS chart or 2702 series Number chart at Week 0 
(Day1) prior to randomisation.  
9.  Visit at Week 8 is the most critical as th is is the  visit scheduled  for the primary endpoint assessment. Thus, every effort should be made to adhere to the visit schedule for the subjects.  
10.  OCT will be p erformed on both eyes at Screening and those images taken from both eyes will be sent to the central reading centre. OCT will be performed on the study eye  prior to IVT 
injection of IP at each visit until Week 48. OCT will also be performed on the study eye at Week 56 (EOS visit) or ET visit. OCT images taken from the study eye will be sent to the central 
reading centre. Only OCT devices certified  by the central reading centre are allowed to be used in this study. If one or more OCT devices are certified  in an investigational site, a subject must 
use the same OCT system from the same manufacture consistently from Screening to Week 56 (EOS visit) or ET visit.  
11.  FP/FA will be performed on both eyes at Screening and those images taken from both eyes will be sent to the central reading centre. FP/FA will also be performed on the study eye prior to 
IVT injection of IP  at Week 32  and at Week 56 (EOS visit) or ET visit. Those images taken from  the study eye at Week 32  and Week 56 (EOS  visit) or ET  visit will be sent to the central

reading centre. Only  FP/FA devices certified by the central reading centre are allowed  to be used in this study . If one or more FP/FA devices are certified in an investigational site, a subject 
must use the same  FP/FA system from the same manufacture consistently from Screening to Week 56 (EOS visit) or ET visit.   
12.  Indirect ophthalmoscopy using a standard way (i.e., usually using a head-mounted light source and a 20- 30 lens) will be performed on the study eye at Screening and prior to IVT injection of 
IP and 0-15 minutes after IVT injection of IP at each visit until Week 48. Indirect ophthalmoscopy will also be performed at Week 56 (EOS visit) or ET visit.  
13.  Slit lamp examination will be performed on both the study eye and fellow eye (non-study eye) at Screening and prior to IVT injection of IP at each visit until Week 48. Slit lamp examination 
will also be performed at Week 56 (EOS visit) or ET visit.  
14.  Intraocular pressure (IOP) should be measured using Goldmann applanation tonometry. The same method of IOP measurement must be used in each subject from Screening to Week  56 (EOS 
visit) or ET visit. IOP will be measured on the study eye at Screening as well as  prior to  each IVT injection of IP  and 30 -60 minutes  after IVT injection of IP at each visit until Week 48.  IOP 
will also be measured at Week 56 (EOS visit) or ET visit.  If IOP is measured prior to OCT and FP/FA, IOP should be carefully measured  not to cause corneal erosion, which might affect the 
quality of OCT/FP/FA images . 
15.  NEI VFQ-25 will be performed at Week 0 (Day1) after randomisation. Subsequently , NEI VFQ -25 should be performed before dilation of pupils  at Week 32 and at Week 56 (EOS visit) or ET 
visit.  
16.  Blood and urine sampl es for clinical laboratory test will be collected at Screening  and prior to IVT injection of IP at Week 8, Week 32, and Week 40 . Blood and urine samples  will also be 
collected  at Week 56 (EOS visit) or ET visit. Urine samples must be collected before performing FA to avoid interference with fluorescein in urinalysis . 
• Haematology: Haemoglobin, haematocrit, platelet count, and white blood cell count (total and differential)  
• Chemistry:  Sodium, potassium, creatinine, glucose, calcium, phosphorus, total bilirubin, albumin, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotrans ferase, alkaline phosphatase, and lactate 
dehydrogenase  
• Urinalysis (dipstick): Protein, blood, leucocytes, nitrite, glucose, ketone, pH, specific gravity, bilirubin,  and urobilinogen  
17.  Blood samples for immunogenicity  assessment  will be collected prior to IVT injection  of IP at Week 0 (Day 1),  Week 4,  Week 8 , Week 24, Week 32, and Week 40. Blood sampl es for 
immunogenicity  assessment  will also be collected at Week 56 (EOS visit) or ET visit.  
18.  Blood samples  for PK assessment will be collected only in approximately 40 subjects participating in PK evaluation (20 subjects per treatment group  in initial randomisation at Week 0 [Day 
1]). Blood sampl es for pre-dose PK assessment will be collecte d prior to IVT injection of IP at Week 0 (Day 1),  Week 4, Week 8, Week 24, Week 32, and Week 40.  Blood sampl es for post-
dose PK assessment will be collected  once between 24 hours and 72 hours after IVT injection of IP at Week 0 (Day 1) and on 1 day, 2 days, and 3 days  after the date of IVT injection of IP at 
Week 24 (total 3 times of PK sample collection for 3 consecutive days) . Blood samples for PK assessment will also be collected at Week 56 (EOS visit).  
19.  Blood samples for PK assessment should not be collected at ET visit.  
20.  Only f or women  of childbearing potential, a serum pregnancy test must be performed at Screening. A pregnancy test (on s erum or urine  at the Investigator ’s discretion ) must  be repeated and  
a negative result shall be obtained  prior to each IVT injection of IP after randomisation.  
21.  Subjects will be administered SB15 or Eylea® 2 mg (0.05 mL) via IVT injection into the study eye every 4 weeks for the first 3 months, followed by 2 mg (0.05 mL) once every 8 weeks up 
to Week 48. Dosing visits will be allowed within ± 7 days  of the scheduled dosing visit date (except Week 0 [Day 1], visit window not allowed).  
22.  The first IVT injection of IP should be performed at the same day of randomisation.  
23.  Ocular A Es in the study eye and/or fellow eye as well as non -ocular A Es will be recorded after the written informed consent is obtained from the subject until Week 56 (EOS visit) or ET visit  
(including a follow -up visit or telephone interview). 
24.  Any medications , including prescription drug s, non -prescription drugs , or any therapy received locally (in the study eye and/or fellow eye) or systemically within 180 days prior to Screening 
will be recorded  until Week 56 (EOS visit) or ET visit (including a follow -up visit or telephone interview). 
25.  If the subject is not randomised with in 21 days after signing the informe d consent form , the subject will be  screen failed. Once a subject is screen failed for one eye, he or she should not be 
re-screened for the same eye. Screening for the other eye is allowed  within the screening period. 
26.  EOT visit is defined as the visit for the last scheduled IVT injection of SB15 or Eylea®. The Sponsor will not provide IP (SB15 or Eylea®) to subjects after they complete the EOT visit.  
27.  EOS visit is defined as Week 56, corresponding to 8 weeks (± 7 days) after the last scheduled IVT injection of SB15 or Eylea®. 
28.  ET visit is recommended to be performed at 8 weeks (± 7 days) after the last IVT injection of SB15 or Eylea®. When this schedule is not available (e.g., due to subject not available), the ET 
visit should still be performed as soon as available and no later than Week 56 from the first IVT injection of IP.  If ET visit occurs before 7 weeks after the last IVT injection of IP, a follow -up

1. Introduction 
 Background 
Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a disease that affects the macular region of the retina, 
causing progressive loss of central vision. AMD is the major cause of severe visual loss in older adults  
if left untreated. Choroidal neovascularisation (CNV) due to neovascular AMD is responsible for most 
AMD- related severe vision loss. Visual impairment lead s to reduced quality of life (QO L), poorer 
general health, and increased mortality. In the developed world, AMD is known as the most frequent cause of uncorrectable severe vision loss in people older than 55 years of age. As many as 30% of adults 
aged 75 years or older develop signs of s enile retinal degeneration, and the prevalence of AMD is 
increasing in an aging population.  
Pathogenesis of AMD includes drusen genesis, lipofuscin genesis, local inflammatory state genesis, as well as angiogenesis. Angiogenesis is the development of new blood vessels from pre- existing vessels 
and whilst being a crucial process in normal physiology, it is an important pathogenic process in both 
benign and malignant disease. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is one of the activators of angiogenesis a nd abnormal  angiogenesis is a hallmark of neovascular AMD. CNV represents the growth 
of new blood vessels from the choroid into the subretinal pigment epithelium. Several proangiogenic factors are consistently upregulated during CNV formation, particularly  two members of the VEGF 
family, VEGF -A and placental growth factor (PlGF). These factors activate quiescent endothelial cells 
and promote cell proliferation, migration , and vascular permeability. Retinal pigment epithelium  (RPE)  
produces VEGF -A via two ma jor pathways; complement activation and oxidative stress. 
Overproduction of VEGF -A leads to the breakdown of the blood- retinal barrier and formation of new 
blood vessels into the retina. Leakage of blood from these abnormal vessels results in oedema and lo ss 
of vision if left untreated  [1]. 
Early treatments for CNV including laser ablation or photodynamic therapy  (PDT)  with verteporfin 
decreased severe vision loss rather than truly stabilizing vision or resulting in clinically significant improvements in visual acuity. Currently, the most common and ef fective clinical treatment for 
neovascular AMD is anti -VEGF therapy. Effective treatment for neovascular AMD is based on 
inhibition of the angiogenic protein VEGF. The first anti -VEGF drug to be used in trials for neovascular 
AMD was pegaptanib sodium which is an aptamer that selectively binds to and neutralizes VEGF -A
165, 
but not VEGF -A121. Ranibizumab is a monoclonal humanized antibody fragment that binds all VEGF-
A isoforms. In the two pivotal studies, ranibizumab showed gains in vision of patients affected by neovascular AMD  that led to widespread use of ranibizumab for treatment of neovascular AMD. 
Another drug that showed efficacy initially when used systemically and then intravitreally was bevacizumab which is a whole monoclonal antibody and binds all isoforms of VEGF -A. Although 
bevacizumab is not approved for this specific indication, it was used as an off -label treatment for 
neovascular  AMD. Aflibercept is a recombinant protein that includes binding domains of VEGF 
receptors 1 and 2 and it blocks all VEGF -A isoforms and VEGF-B, and blocks PlGF. The VIEW 1 and 
2 trial s demonstrate that aflibercept is an effective treatment for AMD, with the every -2-month regimen 
after loading dose
 offering the potential to reduce the risk from monthly intravitreal (IVT) injections 
and the burden of monthly monitoring. Aflibercept is the most recent major new molecule to be used clinically worldwide [1]. 
 Overview of SB15  
SB15 has been developed as a similar biological medicinal product to Eylea® having aflibercept as the 
active substance. Eylea® is currently indicated for the treatment of patients w ith neovascular  AMD, 
macular oedema secondary to retinal vein occlusion (RVO; branch RVO or central RVO), and diabetic 
SB15 (proposed aflibercept biosimilar)  
SB15 -3001  
Version 1.0 , Oct 30 , 2019

macular oedem a (DME) by both European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the United States of America 
(US) Food and Drug Administration (FDA) . In addition, EMA approved Eylea® for the treatment of 
myopic CNV and the US FDA approved Eylea® for the treatment of diabetic retinopathy  [2; 3].  
SB15 is produced by recombinant deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) technology in a Chinese Hamster 
Ovary (CHO) mammalian cell expression system and purified by various affinity and ion exchange 
chromatography steps that include specific viral inactivation and removal procedures. 
According to the guideline International Conference on Harmonisation Q6B, characterisation of a 
biological therapeutic must involve its physicochemical properties, biological activities, purity, impurities, and quantity. The characterisation study will employ the ‘state-of-the- art’ analytica l methods 
in order to investigate the primary, secondary, higher -order structures, and the post -translational 
modifications associated the structural heterogeneity, the charge variants, the purity, and the biological activities.  
1.2.1.  Non-Clinical Studies of SB1 5 
As outlined in the “Guideline on similar biological medicinal products containing biotechnology-
derived proteins as active substance:  non-clinical and clinical issues ” [4], a risk -based approach was 
taken to the non- clinical evaluation of SB15. A series of in vitro  biologic activity studies  is to be  
performed in order to demonstrate non- clinical similarity between SB15 and Eylea
®. In line with the 
guideline, if similarity is to be  demonstrated in quality and in vitro  comparisons to provide non- clinical 
evidence of similarity between SB15 and Eylea®, in vivo studies will not be  performed . Moreover, in 
vitro studies are considered to be the more sensitive measurement than with in vivo  studies . Also , non-
clinical safety pharmacology, reproductive and developmental toxicity, and carcinogenicity studies were not performed, as they are not required for non- clinic al testing of biosimilars as outlined in the 
guideline [ 4].
 
 Comparator Investigational Product: Eylea® 
1.3.1.  Non-clinical Data of Reference Product  
Effects in non- clinical studies on repeated dose toxicity were observed only at systemic exposures 
considered substantially in excess of the maximum h uman exposure after IVT administration at the 
intended clinical dose indicating little relevance to clinical use. Erosions and ulc erations of the 
respiratory epithelium in nasal turbinates in monkeys treated with aflibercept intravitreally were observed at systemic exposures in excess of the maximum human exposure. The systemic exposure based on maximum serum concentration (C
max) and area under the plasma drug concentration -time 
curve (AUC) for free aflibercept were approximately 200 - and 700- fold higher, respectively, when 
compared to corresponding values ob served in humans after an IVT dose of 2 mg. At the No observed 
adverse effect  level (NOAEL) of 0.5 mg/eye in monkeys the systemic exposure was 42 - and 56- fold 
higher based on C max and AUC, respectively. No studies have been conducted on the mutagenic or 
carcinogenic potential of aflibercept. An effect of aflibercept on intrauterine  development was shown 
in embryo -foetal development studies in pregnant rabbits with intravenous (3 to 60 mg/kg) as well as 
subcutaneous (0.1 to 1 mg/kg) administration. The maternal NOAEL was at the dose of 3 mg/kg or 1 mg/kg, respectively. A developmental NOAEL was not identified. At the 0.1 mg/kg dose, the systemic 
exposures based on C
max and cumulative AUC for free aflibercept were approximately 17 - and 10- fold 
higher, respectively, when compared to corresponding values observe d in humans after an IVT  dose of 
2 mg. Effects on male and female fertility were assessed as part of a 6 -month study in monkeys with 
intravenous administration of aflibercept at doses ranging from 3 to 30 mg/kg. Absent or irregular 
menses associated with alterations in female reproductive hormone levels and changes in sperm

morphology and motility were observed at all dose levels. Based on C max and AUC for free aflibercept 
observed at the 3 mg/kg intravenous dose, the systemic exposures were approximately 4,900- fold and 
1,500- fold higher, respectively, than the exposure observed in humans after an IVT dose of 2 mg. All 
changes were reversible [ 2; 3]. 
1.3.2.  Clinical Data of reference product in neovascular AMD  
In patients treated with Eylea® (one injection per month for three consecutive months, followed by one 
injection every 2 months), central retinal thickness (CRT) decreased soon after treatment initiation, and 
the mean CNV lesion size was reduced, consistent with the results seen with ranibizumab 0.5 mg every 
month. 
In the VIEW1 study there were mean decreases in CRT on optical coherence tomography (OCT ) (–130 
and –129 microns at week 52 for the Eylea® 2 mg every two months and ranibizumab 0.5 mg every 
month study groups, respectively). A lso, at the 52 -week time point, in the VIEW2 study there were 
mean decreases in CRT on OCT (–149 and –139 microns for the Eylea® 2 mg every two months and 
ranibizumab 0.5 mg every month study groups, respectively). The reduction of CNV size and reduction 
in CRT were generally maintained in the second year of the studies.  
The ALTAIR study was conducted in Japanese patients with treatment naïve neovascular AMD, 
showing similar outcomes to the VIEW studies using 3 initial monthly Eylea® 2 mg injections, follow ed 
by one injection after a further 2 months, and then continued with a treat -and- extend regimen with 
variable treatment intervals (2 - or 4- week adjustments) up to a maximum 16 -week interval according 
to pre -specified criteria. At Week 52, there were mean decreases in CRT on OCT of –134.4 and –126.1 
microns for the 2- week adjustment group and the 4 -week adjustment group, respectively. The 
proportion of patients without fluid on OCT at Week 52 was 68.3% and 69.1% in the 2- and 4- week 
adjustment groups, respe ctively.  
In a pharmacokinetic (PK)  sub-study in 6 neovascular  AMD patients with frequent sampling, maximum 
plasma concentrations of free aflibercept (systemic C max) were low, with a mean of approximately 0.02 
μg/ml (range 0 to 0.054) within 1 to 3 days after a 2 mg intravitreal injection, and were undetectable 2 
weeks following dosage in almost all patients. Aflibercept does not accumulate in the plasma when administered intravitreally every 4 weeks [ 2]. 
The safety and efficacy of Eylea
® were assessed in two randomised, multi -centre, double -masked, 
active- controlled studies  in patients with neovascular AMD (VIEW1 and VIEW2) with a total of 2,412 
patients treated and evaluable for efficacy (1,817 with Eylea®). Patient ages ranged from 49 to 99 years 
with a mean of 76 years. In these clinical studies, approximately 89% (1,616/1,817) of the patients randomi sed to treatment with Eylea
® were 65 years of age or older, and approximately 63% 
(1,139/1,817) were 75 years of age or older [ 2; 3]. 
 Study Rationale  
A biosimilar is a biological medicinal product that is highly similar to an already authorised original biological medicinal product (reference medicinal product) in terms of quality, tolerability, and efficacy based on a comprehensive comparability exercise [ 4; 5]. The EMA and the US FDA have developed 
specific guidelines for a biologic drug to be approved as a biosimilar [ 5; 6]. These guidelines 
recommend a stepwise approach in developing a biosimilar starting with extensive physicochemical and biological characterisation before initiating clinical studies for the comparison of the efficacy, tolerability, PK properties, and immunogenicity of the biosimilar. The purpose of this study is to 
demonstrate the equivalence in efficacy of SB1 5 compared to Eylea
® and to evaluate the safety and 
immunogenicity in subjects with neovascular AMD. In addition,  systemic exposure of SB15  to Eylea® 
SB15 (proposed aflibercept biosimilar)  
SB15 -3001  
Version 1.0 , Oct 30 , 2019

will also be evaluated in subjects participating in PK  evaluation. 
 Risk and Benefit Assessment  
1.5.1.  Known Potential Risks  
According to Eylea® Prescribing Information (PI) and Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC), 
there are IVT injection related risks such as endophthalmitis, intraocular inflammation, retinal break,  
retinal detachment , iatrogenic traumatic  cataract . There is a risk of intraocular pressure (IOP)  elevation 
within 60 minutes of IVT injection. Sustained increased of IOP was also reported. As this is a therapeutic 
protein, there is a potential for immunogenicity with investigational products (IPs; SB15 or Eylea®). 
There is a potential risk of non-ocular haemorrhage and arterial thromboembolic eve nts  ( AT Es) 
following IVT use of VEGF inhibitors, including Eylea®. There is a risk of retinal pigment epithelial 
tear after anti -VEGF therapy for neovascular  AMD [ 2; 3]. 
In order to ensure the safety of subjects who participate in the study, the followings will be performed 
during the study. Proper aseptic injection techniques must always be used when administering Eylea®. 
The patient should be instructed to report their symptoms related to these adverse events (AEs) without 
delay and should be managed appropriately. Special precaution is needed in patients with poorly controlled glaucoma and Eylea
® should not be injected while the IOP is ≥ 30 mmHg. In all cases, both 
the IOP and the perfusion of the optic nerve head must therefore be monitored and managed 
appropriately. Patients should be instructed to report any signs or symptoms of intraocular inflammation, e.g., pain, photophobia, or redness, which may be a clinical sign attributable to hypersensitivity. There are limited data on safety in the treatment of patients with central RVO, branch RVO, DME , or myopic 
CNV with a history of stroke or transient ischaemic attacks or myocardial infarction within the last 6 
months and caution should be exercised when treating such patients. Caution also should be used in patients with a large and/or high pigment epithelial retinal detachment.  
This study will take place at multicentre with accessible medical facilities which will allow immediate treatment of medical emergencies. All study related procedures will be conducted by medical staff s with 
appropriate level of training and expertise and an understanding of the IPs, its target , and mechanism 
of action. Subjects will have a safety follow -up at the end of study (EOS) visit , 8 weeks after the last 
IVT injection  of IP . An independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will convene at pre -
specified intervals to conduct interim moni toring of accumulating safety data. Following each data 
review, the DSMB will make recommendations regarding the conduct of the study, including continuation of the study without modifications, modification of the protocol, pausing of subject 
enrolment until the resolution of an issue, or termination of the study for safety reasons. 
1.5.2.  Known Potential Benefits  
Neovascular AMD is characterized by growth of abnormal vessel from choroid and retina and vascular 
leakage from abnormal vessels, leading to eventual damage to tissue in macula. VEGF -A is in excess 
in the eye of subjects with neovascular AMD and thought to contribute to pathophysiology of neovascular AMD.  VEGF acts via two receptor tyrosine kinases; VEGFR -1 and VEGFR -2, present on 
the surface of endothelial cells. PlGF binds only to VEGFR -1, which is also present on the surface of 
leucocytes. Excessive activation of these receptors by VEGF -A can result in pathological 
neovascularisation and excessive vascular permeability . Eylea
® acts as a soluble decoy receptor that 
binds VEGF -A and PlGF with higher affinity than their natural receptors, and thereby can inhibit the 
binding and activation of these cognate VEGF receptors.  
Eylea® reduce abnormal growth of new vessels and vascular leakage in retinal diseases. In pooled 
analysis of two VIEW studies in neovascular AMD, subject treated with 2 mg every 8 weeks after 3 
SB15 (proposed aflibercept biosimilar)

monthly loading doses showed Best Corrected Visual Acuity ( BCVA ) improvement of 8.4 letters and 
7.6 letters at Week 52 and Week 96, respectively. T he proportion of patients maintaining visual acuity 
was 95.3% and 92.4%, and the proportion of patients who gained 15 letters or more was 30.9% and 
33.4% at Week 52 and Week 96, respectively. Visual gain was accompanied by decreases in CRT by –
139 microns and –133 microns at Week 52 and Week 96, respectively [ 7; 8]. 
Although clinical data is currently unavailable, SB15 is expected to have similar clinical outcome to Eylea
® based on the physicochemical and biological similarity.  
1.5.3.  Assessment of Potential Risks and Benefits  
If left untreated, neovascular AMD progress overtime resulting in permanent visual loss. Treatment with anti-VEGF agents prevent disease progression and all ow maintenance and improvement of vision. 
Although there have been alternative treatments suc h as PDT with v erteprofin, macular 
photocoagulation, and transpupillary thermotherapy  (TTT) , these treatments failed to improve visual 
acuity and function as shown in anti -VEGF treatments. Benefit of Eylea
® treatment including 
preservation of reading and driving vision, and ability to recognize face outweigh the potential risks of endophthalmitis, intraocular inflammation, retinal tear, retinal detachment, iatrogeni c traumatic cataract, 
development of immunogenicity , and AT Es . 
The available data demonstrate a high degree of physicochemical and biological similarity of SB15 with the reference medicinal product (Eylea
®). The suitability of the methodology employed to e valuate 
the similarity of SB15 and Eylea® in a pharmaceutical setting were confirmed by  EMA  and the US FDA. 
The known and potential risks of receiving SB15 are expected to be similar to those seen with Eylea®. 
In conclusion, sufficient evidence exists for the justification of the administration of SB15, as a similar 
biological medicinal product of Eylea®, to subjects with neovascular AMD.  
The study protocol provides adequate instructions for the detection and treatment of AEs  arising 
following the administration of the IP.

3. Study Design  
 Overview of Study Design 
This is a randomised, double- masked, parallel group, multicentre study to evaluate the efficacy, safety, 
PK, and immunogenicity of SB15 compared to Eylea® in subjects with neovascular AMD. Subjects will 
be randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive either SB15 o r Eylea® (administered via IVT injection 2 mg 
[0.05 mL] every 4 weeks for the first 3 months, followed by 2 mg [0.05 mL] once every 8 weeks). 
At Week 32, subjects in Eylea® treatment group will be randomised again  in a 1:1 ratio to either continue 
on Eylea® treatment or be transitioned to SB15 treatment. IPs ( SB15 or Eylea®) will be administered 
up to Week 48. Subjects receiving SB15 will continue to receive SB15 up to Week 48 but they will also 
follow the randomisation procedure to maintain masking . 
The screening period is 21 days. IP (SB15 or Eylea®) will be given until 48 weeks and the last 
assessment will be done at Week 56 , corresponding to the end of follow- up for all subjects . 
 Rationale for Study Design 
3.2.1.  Scientific Rationale for Study Design  
The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the equivalence in clinical efficacy of Ey lea® and SB15 in 
subjects with neovascular AMD.  
Neovascular AMD is an indication approved by both EMA and the US FDA. In addition, neovascular 
AMD typically demonstrates homogeneous disease progressions with fewer compounding factors than 
DME or RVO. Though DME is one of the major causes of visual impairment in patients with diabetic 
retinopathy and thus a successful management of glycemia reduces the risk of developing pr ogression 
SB15 (proposed aflibercept biosimilar)  
SB15 -3001  
Version 1.0 , Oct 30 , 2019 
 
Samsung Bioepis – Confidential and Proprietary Information  
Page 33 of 94 
 
of DME, the disease progression of DME is influenced by numerous factors such as glycemia, 
hypertension, and lipid level  [9]. RVO, involving a central retinal vein or a branch retinal vein, results 
in various vision loss of visual acuity  (moderate to sev ere) [ 10]. For example, nonischa emic central 
RVO may resolve fully with good visual outcomes or may progress to the ischaemic type, while 
ischaemic central RVO usually presents with a severe visual loss  [11]. 
Left untreated, neovascular AMD shows a common disease progression. For instance, it results in severe visual impairment with an average loss of around 4 lines of visual acuity  within 2 years of disease onset  
[12]. Although this neovascular form accounts for only approximately 10% to 20% of the AMD cases, 
it is responsible for 80% to 90% of  AMD- associated vision loss [ 13]. Therefore, neovascular AMD 
subjects with potential serious clinical outcome without an appropriate treatment are the most appropriate population to evaluate the similarity between SB15 and Eylea
®. 
In the pivotal studies for the treatment of neovascular A MD with Eylea®, the primary efficacy endpoints 
were the proportion of the subjects losing < 15 letters from baseline in visual acuity . The treatment of 
ranibizumab or aflibercept prevents the loss of visual acuity  in approximately 90% of patients and 
impro ves visual acuity  over time in terms of gaining letters.  
The proportion of subjects losing < 15 letters in the visual acuity  indicates the preventive effect of the 
loss of visual acuity . Thus, the proportion of subjects losing < 15 letters in the visual acuity  would not 
be a sensitive primary endpoint to detect product -specific effect between the proposed biosimilar 
product and the reference product. 
On the other hand, change from baseline in visual acuity  could reflect any change (improvement or 
deteriorat ion) in the disease status and is more sensitive in detecting product -specific effects between 
the two treatments. Thus, the mean change from baseline in BCVA is an appropriate primary endpoint 
for the proposed study.  
Visual acuity was assessed monthly in neovascular AMD patients during the study period in pivotal 
studies with Eylea®. The efficacy plateau was reached approximately at Week 12 or Week 16. The most 
sensitive timing to detect any potential differences between the propose d biosimilar product and the 
reference product could be the visit before the efficacy plateau is reached.  
Thus, to increase sensitivity, the evaluation of equivalence between SB15 and Eylea® is to be conducted 
at Week 8 before the efficacy plateau is reach ed. 
Transition will be performed at Week 32 to investigate the clinical impact of switching from Eylea® to 
SB15 . 
3.2.2.  Rationale for Dose Selection 
The selection of the aflibercept dose and dosing interval is based on safety and efficacy data obtained from 2 piv otal clinical t rials (VIEW 1 and VIEW 2) in neovascular AMD. Aflibercept administration in 
this study is 2 mg (0.05 mL or 50 microliters) administered by IVT injection every 4 weeks 
(approximately every 28 days, monthly) for the first 12 weeks (3 months), followed by 2 mg (0.05 mL) via IVT injection once every 8 weeks (2 months).  
3.2.3.  Rationale for Pharmacokinetic Assessments  
Although a Phase I comparative PK study  comparing the proposed biosimilar product to reference 
product is a fundamental component in supporting a demonstration of biosimilarity, a Phase I comparative PK study has not been necessary to support a demonstration of biosimilarity due to negligible  systemic exposure following IVT injection of aflibercept. However, for supporting the 
SB15 (proposed aflibercept biosimilar)  
SB15 -3001

assessment of overall systemic safety of SB15 relative to Ey lea®, systemic exposures will be collected 
and compared in the subgroup population (approximately 40 subjects, 20 subjects per treatment group  
in initial randomisation at Week 0 [Day 1] ) in Phase III comparative efficacy study.  
3.2.4.  Rationale for Immunogenicity Assessments  
Biological/biotechnology -derived proteins can induce an unwanted immune response that is triggered 
by more than a single factor and the consequence of immunogenicity may vary considerably, ranging 
from irrelevant to therapy to serious and life -threatening.  Immune responses may affect both safety and 
effectiveness such as altering PK, inducing anaphylaxis, or promoting development of NAbs that 
neutralise the product as well as its endogenous protein counterpart. 
In pivotal  clinical studies  of Eylea®, the fre quency of ADAs  has been reported as 1% to 4 %. Observed 
levels of immunogenicity were relatively low and there were no differences in efficacy or safety 
between patients with or without immunoreactivity. 
For subject safety and for demonstrating biosimilarity, immunogenicity will be assessed in this study 
according to the recommended guideline. 
 Duration of Study Participation 
After Screening, the duration of study participation will be 56 weeks per subject including 48- week 
treatment period and 8- week post- treatment follow -up period.  
 Number of Subjects  
Approximately 446 subjects are planned to be randomised  from approximately 60 sites for study 
duration.  
 End of Study Definition  
A subject is considered to have completed the study if he or she has complet ed the last visit or the last 
scheduled procedure shown in Table 1. The EOS is defined as completion of the last scheduled visit 
(Week 56) shown in Table 1. The end of this clinical study is defined as completion of the last subject ’s 
EOS  visit. 
4. Study Population  
 Overview  
Eligibility for participation in this study will be based on the inclusion/exclusion criteria. Only one eye will be designated as the study eye. For subjects who meet eligibility criteria in both eyes, the eye with 
the worse visual acuity  will be selected as the study eye. If both eyes have equal visual acuity , the eye 
with clearer lens and ocular media will be selected at the Investigator ’s discretion. If there is no 
objective basis for selecting the study eye, factor such as ocular domin ance, other ocular pathology , and 
subject preference should be considered by the  Investigator in making the selection.  Subject with only 
one functional eye (defined as BCVA of counting finger  or less on the eye with worse vision) cannot be 
enrolled, even i f otherwise eligible for the study . 
 Inclusion Criteria  
Subjects must meet all of the following criteria to be eligible for the study:

the ICF , the subject should be screen failed.  
Once a subject is screen failed  for one eye , he or she should not be re -screened  for the same eye. 
Screening for the other eye is allowed within  the screening period and the subject will use the same  
screening number. 
 Repl acement  
Subjects who are discontinued from IP after randomisation will not be replaced.  
5. Treatment and Investigational Product 
 Treatment of the Subjects  
5.1.1.  Dosing and Treatment Schedule  
Subjects will be administered SB15 or Eylea® 2 mg via IVT injection  into the study eye every 4 weeks 
for the first 3 months, followed by 2 mg once every 8 weeks up to Week 48 (a total of 8 administrations 
of IP) unless they are early discontinued from IP.  
IP injection will be performed by the Investigator according to delegation of study personnel for this 
study. 
Dosing visits will be allowed within ± 7 days of the scheduled dosing date (except Week 0 [Day 1] , 
visit window not allowed). Dosing skip is defined when a subject does not receive the IP within 20 days 
after sch eduled dosing date for Week 0  and/or Week  4 visits and 48 days after scheduled dosing date 
for the subsequent visits . Next scheduled dosing date and visit window should not be altered even 
though previous dosing is not performed on the scheduled dosing date or previous dosing is skipped. 
5.1.2.  Assignment of Subjects to Treatment Group  
A unique subject number will be assigned to subjects at Screening. The subject number will be used to 
register the subject using the Interactive Web Response System (IWRS) and th e subject will then be 
randomised (in a ratio of 1:1) to either SB15 or Eylea®. At Week 32, subjects receiving Eylea® will be 
randomised again in a 1:1 ratio to either continue on Eylea® treatment or be transitioned to SB15  
treatment . Subjects receiving SB 15 will continue to receive SB15 but they will also follow the 
randomisatio n procedure to maintain masking . 
These randomisations will occur according to a computer -generated randomisation scheme which will 
randomise subjects at a centre- level. If a subject  is withdrawn , the randomisation number(s) will not be 
re-used. At each study visit the Investigator or designee should contact the IWRS and an appropriate 
number of codes will be provided. These codes will indicate which vials should be dispensed to the 
subject. Further details on using the IWRS system are presented in the IWRS M anual.  
5.1.3.  Withholding Investigational Products  
If a subject experiences an AE or the subject ’s safety or well -being could be compromised by IVT 
injection of IP at the Investigator ’s discretion, IPs should be withheld until the event has resolved or 
adequately repaired. 
In case of following events in the study eye , IP must be withheld . 
• ≥ 30 mmHg  in pre- injection IOP measurement  
• A retinal break

• Active or suspected ocular and peri ocular infection  
• Active severe intraocular inflammation  (e.g., 4+ anterior chamber cell/flare or 4+ vitritis ) 
• Performed or planned intraocular surgery within the previous or next 28 days 
For the following events  in the study eye, IP withhold ing should be considered by the Investigator . 
• A decrease in BCVA of  ≥ 30 letters compared with the last assessment of visual acuity  
• A subretinal haemorrhage involving the centre of the fovea  equal to or more than one DA in 
size or , if the size of the haemorrhage is  ≥ 50%, of the total lesion area  
In case of following events, IP must be permanently discontinued 
• Rhegmatogenous retinal detachment or full- thickness macular hole in the study eye  
• A subject mis ses any of first two doses or two consecutive doses during the study period after 
randomisation 
NOTE: Please refer to the permanent IP discontinuation criteria in Section  7.2.1 . 
5.1.4.  Masking  
This study is double-masked. Subjects, Investigators, and other study personnel will remain masked to 
the treatment group assignment throughout the study period after randomisation. 
To ensure the masking of the treatment group assignment, one carton will contain only one IP vial (SB15 
or Eylea®). The carton and IP vial will be packed and labelled in identical appearance.  
5.1.5.  Unmasking  
After all subjects complete the procedures at Week 24, or its corresponding visit, a limited number of 
identified individuals of the Sponsor and/or Contract Research Organisation (CRO) will be unmasked 
only for the reporting purpose to regulatory agency. A vailable efficacy and safety data, PK, and 
immunogenicity data will be analysed and reported in the main clinical study r eport (CSR). However, 
subjects, Investigators, and other study personnel will remain masked throughout the whole study 
period 
After the  last subject completes the procedures at Week 56  (EOS visit) or the corresponding visit and 
database is locked, the treatment group assignment will be unmasked and all study data will be analysed 
and reported in the f inal CSR.  
Emergency and accidental unmasking are referred to  in Section 8.1.7. 
 Investigational Product  
5.2.1.  Identity of Investigational Product 
The IPs will be supplied to i nvestigational site in one carton containing a single vial.  
Details of the IPs are provided in Table 3 .

5.2.2.  Preparation and administration of Investigational Product  
IPs should be inspected visually prior to administration. If particulates, cloudiness, or discoloration are 
visible, the vial must not be used.  
Using aseptic technique, all of the SB15 and Eylea® vial contents are withdrawn through a filter needle 
attached to a 1 -mL syringe. The filter needle should be discarded after withdrawal of the vial contents 
and should not be use d for IVT injection. The filter needle should be replaced with a sterile 30 -gauge x 
1/2-inch needle for the IVT injection of IP. The contents should be expelled until the plunger tip is 
aligned with the line that marks 0.05 mL on the syringe. 
The IVT injec tion procedure should be carried out under controlled aseptic technique in accordance 
with local practice.  
Each vial should only be used for the treatment of a single eye.  
5.2.3.  Formulation, Packaging, and Labelling  
Aflibercept (SB15 or Eylea®) will be supplied for use as a n iso-osmotic solution for IVT injection (2 
mg per vial for SB1 5 or US sourced Eylea®). 
These IP vials will be packed and labelled in a double -masked manner for clinical use. The labels for 
carton and vial will contain the protocol number, unique identifier, Sponsor company name, expiry or 
retest date, storage condition , and all other details according to the Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) 
and other relevant local laws and/or regulations.  
The temperature will be monitored properly during the study period. The IP should be stored in a secure area and clearly labelled and stored away from other IP or medication to prevent confusion (for example in a clearly marked box on a separate shelf of the refrigerator).  
A detailed guideline for IP preparation, administration, storage, and destruction will be provided in the Pharmacy Manual.  
5.2.4.  Product Storage and Stability  
SB15 and Eylea
® should be stored at 2° C to 8 °C (36 °F to 46 °F) in the original carton until time of use  
to protect from light. The temperature will be monitored properly during the study period. If continuous monitoring is not available then manual temperature logs should be generated and recorded to ensure proper storage conditions. If a temperature deviation occurred, responsible per son should contact the 
Sponsor to determine if the drug is still appropriate for use. 
Do not freeze SB15 or Eylea
® vials. The IPs must not be used beyond the expiration date.

5.2.5.  Treatment Compliance and Investigational Product Accountability  
All IP injections  will be given by the Investigator  or designee  to ensure compliance. The exact date and 
time of IP injection must be recorded in the source documentation and the electronic case report form 
(eCRF) . 
The Investigator or designee should maintain the documents of IP accountability and record the IP kit 
number administered to subjects. IP accountability and dispensing records must be kept and contain the 
following information: 
• The identification of the subjects to whom the drug was dispensed. 
• The date(s) and quantity of the drug dispensed and exact package to the subject. 
• The dispensing and inventory logs must be available for inspection by the monitor. 
The used IP will be destructed at the investigational site according to local regulation  after drug 
accountabil ity done. All unused IPs should be returned to the Sponsor or designated vendor unless local 
destruction at site is approved by the Sponsor. If destruction is authorised at the investigational site, the 
Investigator must ensure that the materials are destr oyed in compliance with all applicable 
environmental regulations, institutional policies , and any instructions provided by the Sponsor. 
Destruction of the IP must be adequately documented. 
 Prohibited Medication or Therapy  
Prohibited medication and therapy during the study period are presented in Table 4 . 
Any other medications that are considered necessary for the subject ’s welfare, and that are not expected 
to interfere with the evaluation of the IP may be given at the Investigator ’s discretion.  
Details of any medications including prescription  drugs , non- prescription drugs , or any therapy (except 
dietary supplements, vitam ins, or minerals) received locally (in the study eye and/or fellow eye) or 
systemically within 180 days prior to Screening will be collected until Week 5 6 (EOS visit) or early 
termination ( ET) visit (including a follow -up visit or telephone interview) . Details to be recorded 
include name (generic name preferred), dose number and unit, frequency of administration, route of administration, start and stop dates, and the AE it relates to (if applicable).

 Fellow Eye Treatment  
The fellow eye (non- study eye) will not be considered as an additional study eye. If a subject ha s AMD 
in the fellow eye, the subject could receive ONLY Eylea® during the study period and should remain in 
the study. Ey lea® for AMD treatment in the fellow eye will be reimbursed or provided by the Sponsor 
during the study period after randomisation. 
Fellow eye injection will be performed by the Investigator for this study. However, visits for fellow eye 
injection are not part of study, thus it will be scheduled in accordance with local practice. If a subject 
has both eyes injected on the same day, fel low eye should be injected after completion of IVT injection 
of IP on the study eye. Ocular AEs for the fellow eye and non-ocular AEs will be monitored and recorded 
after the written informed consent is obtained from the subject until Week 56 (EOS visit) or ET visit.  
6. Study Assessment  
 Efficacy Assessment  
6.1.1.  Best Corrected Visual Acuity  (BCV A)  
Visual acuity  will be assessed in both the study eye and fellow eye (non- study eye) at Screening and 
prior to IVT injection of IP at each visit until Week 48. V isual acuity  will also be assessed in both the 
study eye and fellow eye (non -study eye) at Week 56 (EOS visit) or ET visit.

Visual acuity  will be assessed using original series ETDRS charts or 2702 series Number charts at a 
starting distance of 4 meters, and th en continue at a distance of 1 meter, if required by ETDRS protocol . 
Subject must use the same type of  chart consistently from Screening to Week 56 (EOS visit) or ET visit. 
Visual acuity  testing must be performed before dilation of pupils and other ophthal mic procedure s 
including FP  (fundus photography) /FA (fluorescein angiography) and OCT assessment.  
Visual acuity  examiners and visual acuity  lanes at investigational sites must be certified to ensure 
consistent measurement of BCV A prior to BCV A test to subject s. 
A det ailed instruction for conducting visual acuity  testing and refra ction will be provid ed in the Visual 
Acuity Testing M anual. 
NOTE ( refer to Section  8.4) 
• A decrease in visual acuity of ≥ 15 letters from  the last assessment of visual acuity should be 
reported as AE/ serious AE ( SAE ) as appropriate.  
• A decrease in visual acuity  of ≥ 30 letters from the last assessment of visual acuity  should be 
reported as SAE.  
• A decrease in visual acuity  to the level of light p erception or worse  should be reported as SAE. 
6.1.2.  Anatomical Parameters  
The average retinal thickness in the central 1 -mm area i n the ETDRS grid (CST  and TRT ), the presence 
of intra- or sub- retinal fluid and sub- RPE fluid  will be evaluated using OCT at Screening and prior to 
IVT injection of IP until Week 48. OCT will also be performed at Week 56 (EOS visit) or ET visit.  
The CNV area and the presence of CNV leakage will also be evaluated using FP/FA at Screening and 
prior to IVT injection of IP at Week 32. FP/FA will also be performed at Week 56 (EOS visit) or ET

 Safety Assessment  
6.2.1.  Adverse Events  
All AEs including ocular AEs in the study eye and/or fellow eye as well as non-ocular AEs will be 
recorded from  the time  when the written informed consent is obtained from the subject to Week 56 
(EOS visit) or ET visit  (including a follow -up visit or telep hone interview) . AEs should be elicited from 
subjects using non- leading questions such as ‘How are you feeling? ’. Further information on AE 
monitoring and reporting is presented in Section 8.  
6.2.2.  Clinical Laboratory Evaluations 
Blood and urine sampl es for clinical laboratory test will be collected at Screening and prior to IVT 
injection of IP at Week 8, Week 32, and Week 40. Blood and urine sampl es for clinical laboratory test 
will be also collected at Week 56 (EOS visit) or ET visit. Urine samples must be collected before 
performing FA to avoid interference with fluorescein in urinalysis . 
Blood samples will be analysed in central laboratory and uri ne samples will be tested in each 
investigational site by using  a dipstick  which will be provided by the Sponsor . A detailed process for 
clinical laboratory sampling, handling, storage , and shipping will be provided in the Central Laboratory

The Investigator will check any laboratory values which have potential significance in subject ’s safety 
during the study period. The Investigator will also evaluate any change in laboratory values. Each out 
of range result should be assessed as not clinically significant or clinically significant by the Investigator  
and reported as AE if relevant . All laboratory abnormalities that require intervention (e.g., IP 
withholding, IP discontinuation, concomitant medication) must be assessed  as clinically significant and 
the clinically significant abnormalities should be recorded as AEs.  
Clinical laboratory test including haematology, clinical chemistry, and urinalysis may be repeated 
during the study period at the Investigator’s discretion. 
When a scheduled laboratory test result would not be available due to  the subject  missing the visit or to  
technical issues (e.g., sampling error, handling error, tube breakage), it is recommended to perform or 
repeat the test  as soon as available (e.g., at the next scheduled visit) at discretion of the Investigator . 
For laboratory tests required at  Screen ing, any missing result should  be repeated  within the screening 
period.  
6.2.3.  Physical Examination 
Physical examination will be performed at Screening and Week 56 (EOS visit) or ET visit. The physical 
examination may include an assessment of the subject ’s general appearance, skin, head, neck, throat, 
lymph nodes, cardiovascular, neurological, thyroid, m usculoskeletal/extremities, respiratory systems, 
and the subject ’s abdomen. Abnormal findings will be documented on the source document, and any 
clinically significant abnormality or worsening of a previously noted abnormality should be recorded as an AE.  
Body weight will be measured and recorded at Screening and Week 56 (EOS visit) or ET visit, whereas  
height will be measured and recorded only at Screening
. 
6.2.4.  Vital Signs  
Vital signs include blood pressure, pulse rate, and body temperature. Vital signs will be assessed at 
Screening and prior to IVT injection of IP at each visit until Week 48. Vital signs will also be assessed

at Week 56 (EOS visit) or ET visit .  
The Investigator should assess all vital signs and any cl inically significant abnormalities should be 
reported as AE.  
 Pregnancy Test  
For women of childbearing potential, a serum pregnancy test must be performed at Screening. The 
serum samples taken at Screening will be analysed in central laboratory.   
At each visit during the study, women of childbearing potential must repeat a pregnancy test and a 
negative result shall be obtained before each IVT injection of IP. After randomisation,  pregnancy tests 
will be performed either on serum or urine at the Investigator ’s discretion . 
Additional unscheduled ( serum or urine ) pregnancy test s may be performed during the study period  
when any suspicion of pregnancy arises  at the Investigator ’s discretion.  
When a pregnancy test result at Screening would not be available due to technical issues (e.g., handling 
error, sampling error, tube breakage), the test shall be repeated in all circumstances (missing results at Screening would be considered as screening failure).  
 Ophthalmic Assessments  
6.4.1.  Full Ophthalmic Examinations  
The full ophthalmic examination will consist of macroscopic examination of the eye and adnexa 
(including but not limited to abnormal pupil reaction to light and afferent pupillary defect , etc.), slit 
lamp biomicroscopy, IOP measurements , and indirect ophthalmoscopy. Abnormal finding  should be 
assessed as not clinically significant or clinically significant by the Investigator  and reported as AE if 
relevant.  
During study period, fellow eye will be evaluated according to local practice  to determine whether or 
not AMD develops. I f the AMD is diagnosed in the fellow eye during the study period, this event should 
be also reported as an AE.  
Slit lamp biomicroscopy  
The slit lamp examination of anterior segment (conjunctiva, cornea, lens, iris, aqueous reaction [flare 
and cells ]) will be performed on both the study eye and fellow eye at Screening and prior to IVT 
injection of IP at each visit until Week 48 . Slit lamp examination will also be performed at Week 56 
(EOS visit) or ET visit.  
Grading scales for anterior chamber flare and cells are provided in APPENDIX A  and APPENDIX B . 
NOTE  
The following  events should be reported as AE of special interest ( AESI ) (Section 8.3): 
• Any case of intraocular infection  (suspected infection) such as endophthalmitis 
• Any case of non-infectious intraocular inflammation such as iritis, vitritis, and iridocyclitis  
• Iatrogenic tra umatic cataract

IOP will be measured on the study eye at Screening as well as  prior to I VT injection of IP  and 30-60 
minutes after IVT injection of IP at each visit until Week 48. IOP will also be measured at Week 56 
(EOS visit) or ET visit.  In case of any abnormalities, relevant immediate intervention and follow up per  
standard of care should be taken to ensure subject s safety. AEs/SAEs should be reported as appropriate 
(Section 8). 
IOP should be measured using Goldmann applanation tonometry. The same method of IOP 
measurement must be used in each subject from Screening to Week 56 (EOS visit) or ET visit. In case  
IOP is  measured prior to OCT and FP/FA, IOP should be carefully measured  not to cause corneal erosion, 
which might affect the quality of OCT/FP/FA images.   
NOTE  
The f ollowing events should be reported as AESI ( Section 8.3 ): 
• New onset pre-injection IOP of ≥ 25 mmHg  
• Post-injection IOP of ≥ 35 mmHg  
Indirect ophthalmoscopy  
Indirect ophthalmoscopy using a standard way (i.e., usually using a head- mounted light source and a 
20-30 lens)  will be performed on the study eye to evaluate posterior segment including vitreous, optic 
nerve, macula, peripheral retina , or retinal vasculature at Screening and prior to IVT injection of IP and 
0-15 min after IVT injection of IP at each visit until Week 48. Indirect ophthalmoscopy will also be 
performed at Week 56  (EOS visit) or ET visit.  
Vitreous will be assessed for inflammatory response and the grading scale for vitreous haze  is provided 
in APPENDIX C . 
NOTE  
The events should be reported as AESI ( Section 8.3 ): 
• Retinal pigment epithelial tear  
• Subretinal haemorrhage with the size of 1 DA or more involving the centre of the fovea , or if 
the size of the haemor rhage is ≥ 50% of the total lesion area  
6.4.2.  Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT)

to the central reading centre.  
FP/FA will also be performed  on the study eye  prior to IVT injection of IP at Week 32 and at Week 56 
(EOS visit) or ET visit. FP/FA images taken from the study eye will be sent to the central reading centre.  
Lesion type, t otal lesion area, CNV area , haemorrhage, and the presence of CNV leakage will be 
evaluated in the central reading centre.  The Investigator will evaluate the FP/FA images sent to the 
central reading centre in terms of safety assessment.  
Site staffs who will perform FA/FP in this study must be certified by the central reading centre before 
performing study procedure. Only FP/FA device certified by the central reading centre is allowed to be 
used in this study. If one or more FP/FA devices are certified in an investigational site, a subject must 
use the same FP/FA  system  from the same manufacture consistently from Screening to Week 56 (EOS 
visit) or ET visit.  
All original FP/FA images will be kept in the investigational site and copies will be sent to the central 
reading centre for analysis and archiving. If any significant change in the posterior pole (e.g., subretinal haemorrhage, macular hole, vitreous haemorrhage or opacity, retinal detachment, etc.) is detected with fundus examination, additional FP and/or FA can be performed at the Investigator ’s discretion, but the 
images will not be sent to the central reading centre. 
A detailed instruction  for FP/FA image acquisition and transmission will be provided in the Image 
Handbook.

Blood sampl es for immunogenicity assessment will be collected prior to IVT  injection of IP at Week 0 
(Day 1), Week 4, Week 8, Week 24, Week 32, and Week 40. Blood samples for immunogenicity 
assessment will also be collected at Week 56 (EOS visit) or ET visit.  Subjects ’ samples may be used for 
method validation and/or investigation , only for this study. 
A detailed process for immunogenicity sampling, handling, storage , and shipping will be provided in 
the Central Laboratory Manual for PK and Immunogenicity. 
7. Study Procedures  
During this study, efficacy, safety, PK, and immunogenicity assessments will be performed. All results 
shall be recorded in the source documents along with the date and time the procedures were performed. 
Such assessments must be performed at the times outlined in  Table 1. 
 Study Flow and Visit Schedule  
NOTE : The most critical assessment will be at Week 8 as th is is the visit for primary endpoint 
assessment. Thus, every effort should be made to adhere to the visit schedule for the subjects.  
7.1.1.  Screening  Visit  (Visit 1 , D-21 to D-1)  
Screening shall be performed within 21 days before randomisation (i.e., excluding the day of 
randomisation).  
• Written informed consent  
The Investigator must discuss the study with the subject and obtain written informed consent from the 
subject prior to any study related procedures. If the subject is not randomised within 21 days after 
signing the ICF, the subject will be screen failed . Once  a subject is screen failed  for one eye, he or she 
shall not be re -screened  for the same eye. Screening for the other eye is allowed  within the screening 
period ( Section 4.4). 
The following procedures should be performed:

Investigators are advised to send for review OCT and FP/FA images to the central reading centre as 
soon as possible as this could take more time than the other procedures and Investigators should avoid 
exceeding the allowed 21 days  for completing Screening. If the subject is screen failed due to any 
reasons before the Investigator send OCT and/or FP/FA images to  the central reading centre, the 
Investigator does not have to send the subject ’s OCT and/or FP/FA images to  the central reading centre.  
The c entral reading centre will send central review results confirming the subject ’s eligibility to the 
investigational site. If a subject is confirmed as ineligible from the central reading centre due to poor

may be allowed to send a second set of images to the central reading centre. In this case, only FP/FA or 
OCT (and not all other screening procedures) will be repeated  and the result should be confirmed within 
the screening period of 21 days . Only in this case, the subject will retain the subject number initially 
assigned.  
Once the subject is confirmed eligible for the study, the subject will be reminded in particular of the 
study restrictions such as contraception, prohibited medications , and other study requirements. The 
Investigator shall pay attention to each subject ’s particular needs in order to provide the necessary 
training and advice and foster protocol complian ce.

7.1.4.  Early Termination (ET) Visit  
Subjects who discontinue from the study at any time before study termination will be require d to attend 
an ET visit.  
The ET visit is recommended to be performed at 8 weeks  (± 7 days)  after the last IVT injection of IP. 
When this  schedule is not available (e.g., due to subjec t not available), the ET visit should still be 
performed as soon as available and no later than Week 56 from the first  IVT  injection  of IP . 
In particular, for safety monitoring, if ET visit occurs before 7 weeks after the last IVT injection of IP, 
a follow -up visit or telephone interview will be pursued at 8 weeks (± 7 days) after the last IVT injection  
of IP in order to collect AEs and related concomitant medications. If a subject is not  available, a follow -
up visit or telephone interv iew will be performed as soon as possible, but no later than Week 56 from 
the first IVT injection of IP . Every attempt shall be made to contact the subject  for safety monitoring 
unless the subject  has withdrawn his/her consent  to collect safety -related information ( Section 7.2.1 ). 
The following procedures will be performed: 
• NEI VFQ -25 (prior to dilation of pupil) 
• Physical examination ( including body weight) 
• Vital signs (temperature, blood pressure, and pulse rate) 
• Blood and urine sampling for clinical laboratory tests 
- Urine samples must be collected before performing FA to avoid interference with 
fluorescein in urinalysis . 
• Blood sampling for immunogenicity 
• Pregnancy test (serum or urine at the Investigator ’s discretion ) for all women of childbearing 
potential 
• Ocular assessments:  
- BCVA examination using original series ETDRS charts or 2702 series Number charts 
(before dilation  of the pupils and other ophthalmic procedures including FP/FA or OCT 
assessment)

If a subject discontinues the study treatment to receive other alternate treatment, ET visit should be 
performed prior to starting the alternate treatment ( Section 7.2.1). 
7.1.5.  Unscheduled visit  
Unscheduled visit is allowed during study period at the discretion of the Investigator, if deemed 
clinically necessary. Any tests, procedures, or assessments performed at t he unscheduled visits will be 
recorded in the source documents and be entered in the eCRF  if entry is available. 
 Discontinuation  
7.2.1.  Subject Discontinuation from Study Treatment  
The subject must be permanently discontinued from IPs in the event of any of the following: 
• Consent withdrawal by subject 
- If the subject withdraw s his/her consent, the Investigator must inquire the reasons for 
consent withdrawal as to whether it is related to the study (e.g., documented lack of 
efficacy, AE , or pregnancy); however, the subject could refuse to provide such reason . 
- If the main reason for consent withdrawal is considered related to the study, the Investigator may select the appropriate reason for withdrawal (other than just consent 
withdrawal) from a pre -defined list as be low.
 
• Any newly developed or aggravated ophthalmic abnormality other than AMD in the study eye which could interfere with evaluation of  efficacy or safety of IP (e.g., retinal vascular 
abnormality, glaucoma, etc.) 
• Rhegmatogenous retinal detachment  or full-thickness macular hole in the study eye 
• AEs in the study eye  which in the opinion of the Investigator and/or subject would require IP 
discontinuation (e.g., intraocular inflammation, subretinal haemorrhage, vitreous haemorrhage, 
local infection, etc.)  
• Decision by the Investigator that the subject requires alternate treatment to treat neovascular AMD (e.g., other anti-VEGF agents, PDT, intravitreal gas injection, vitrectomy , or other 
surgical intervention ) in the study eye 
Note:
 ET visit should be per formed  prior to starting the alternate treatment.  
• Development of DME in either eye

• Any other AEs and/or interventions considered intolerable as expose the subject to a risk that 
outweighs the benefits of participating in the study  in the opinion of the Investigator and/or 
subject  
• Decision by the Sponsor that IP discontinuation is in the subject’ s best medical interest  
• Protocol deviations which may adversely affect the subject ’s safety and/or integrity of data as 
agreed by the Investigator and/or upon request from the Sponsor 
• IP non- compliance  
- A subject misses any of first two doses (IVT injection of IP at Week 0 [Day 1]  and Week 4) 
after randomisation  
- A subject misses two consecutive doses during the study period after randomisation  
• Administrative decision by the Investigator and/or the Sponsor for a reason (e.g., a suspicion 
of fraud, the subject enrolling in multiple clinical studies, lack of compliance, etc.) other than 
that of an AE  
• Lost to follow -up 
Note:  Before a subject is deemed lost to follow -up, the Investigator or designee will make 
every effort to regain contact with the subject.  
• Unmasking (except unmasking for the purpose of regulatory reporting) 
• Pregnancy  of study subject 
• Death of any cause  
If a subject is prematurely discontinued from IP due to any of the above described reasons excluding death, the subject will complete the ET procedures (Section 7.1.4 ) and will be requested if he/she agrees 
to provide written consent for continuing the follow -up and further data collection subsequent to his or 
her ET visit.  
If a subject who is permanently discontinued from IP agrees to continue follow- up for associated clinical 
outcome information until Week 56, the consent form for ET subject shall be requested to be  signed by 
the subject for this limited participation in the study, and the subject will continue to be assessed for all 
study endpoints per protocol until the subject withdraw s consent or receives other non- protocol defined 
treatment , whichever occurs earlier . 
If a subject does not agree to continue follow -up of associated clinical outcome information, the subject 
will be terminated from the study accordingly. The data and blood samples collected on the subject up 
to ET visit remains in the study database and no further data will be collected. 
In all cases, the reason for IP discontinuation must be recorded in the  eCRF  and in the subj ect’s medical 
record.  
7.2.2.  Discontinuation of Study Sites  
Investigational site participation may be discontinued if the Sponsor, the Investigator, or the Institutional 
Review Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) of the investigational site judge it necessary 
for any reason. Health authorities and IRB/IEC will be informed about the discontinuation of the study 
sites in accordance with applicable regulations.

7.2.3.  Discontinuation of the Study  
The Sponsor may terminate this study prematurely for reasonable cause provided that written notice is 
submitted  to the Investigator, IRB/IEC, and relevant authorities  in advance of the intended termination:  
• Unsatisfactory  enrolment with respect to quantity or quality 
• Discontinuation of development of the study drug 
• The decision by the Sponsor to terminate the study based on medical/ethical, business 
decision/strategic, or study conduct- related reasons  
If the study is terminated or discontinued prematurely, the Sponsor will promptly notify to the 
Investigator. The Investigator may be informed of additional procedures to be followed in order to 
assure that adequate consideration is given to the protection of the subject’ s welfare and best interests.  
Health authorities and IRB/IEC will be informed about the discontinuation of the study in accordance with applicable regulations. 
8. Safety Monitoring and Reporting 
 Adverse Events  (AEs)  
8.1.1.  Definition of Adverse Event  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject , clinical investigation subject administered the 
medicinal (investigational) product or other protocol -imposed intervention and which does not 
necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment or intervention. An AE can therefore 
be an unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or 
disease temporally associated with the use of any dose of a medicinal (investigational) product or other protocol- imposed intervention regardless of attribution.  
All AEs including ocular AEs in the study eye and/or fellow eye as well as non-ocular AEs will be 
collected from the time when the written informed consent is obtained from the subject until Week 56 
(EOS visit) or ET visit  (including a follow- up visit or telephone interview) . 
In particular, if the AMD is diagnosed in the fellow eye during the study period, this  event should be 
also reported as an AE . 
Pre-existing conditions and any abnormal findings from assessments at the time of Screening which are 
not related to protocol -imposed intervention (i.e., before the first IP a dministration)  should not be 
reported as AEs, but reported among the medical history of the subject. H owever , pre-existing 
conditions which worsen (i.e., change in severity) that meet the definition of an AE during the study 
period are to be reported as AE s. 
Diagnostic and therapeutic non- invasive and invasive procedures, such as surgery, should not be 
reported as AEs assuming that the medical condition for which the procedure was performed is known. The underlying medical condition should be reported as AE  accordingly. For example, an acute 
appendicitis that begins during the AE reporting period should be reported as an AE and the resulting 
appendectomy should be recorded as treatment of the AE. 
By definition, any event that emerges during IP treatment havi ng been absent pre -treatment, or
 worsens 
relative to the pre- treatment state will be considered as a Treatment -emergent Adverse Event (TEAE) . 
For the purposes of safety analysis, TEAEs will be collected and analysed.

SB15 -3001  
Version 1.0 , Oct 30 , 2019

8.1.2.  Clinically Significant Abnormality  
If there are any abnormalities discovered during the laboratory test, physical examination, vital signs , 
and/or other safety assessments and the abnormality is assessed clinically significant by the Investigator, 
it should be reported as an AE. This does not apply to pre -existing conditions which have been 
documented at Screening or if the abnormality is consistent with a current diagnosis (underlying disease or other AEs). If it is not specified or defined elsewhere in the protocol, clinically significant 
abnormalit ies may include the events that led to a  clinically significant  intervention, including 
withdrawal of the IP treatment, significant additional concomitant medication, and others , upon medical 
judgement by the Investigator.  
If a clinically significan t laboratory finding, or any other abnormality  emerging  from safety assessment s, 
is not a ssociated with a diagnosis of a disease or syndrome, the abnormality itself should be reported as 
an AE in the eCRF. If the abnormality can be characterised by a preci se clinical term, the clinical term 
should be reported as the AE. For example, an elevated serum potassium concentration  of 7.0 mEq/L 
should be reported as ‘hyperkalemia’.  Observations of the same clinically significant abnormality from 
visit to visit shou ld not be repeatedly reported as AEs in the eCRF, unless their severity  grade , 
seriousness, or etiology changes.  
8.1.3.  Period of Observation for Adverse Events  
All AEs (ocular or non-ocular) , including SAEs, will be collected  from the time of signing the written  
informed consent until Week 56 (EOS visit).  However, if a subject would withdraw from the study prior 
to Week 56 (EOS visit), AEs and SAEs shall be collected as follows : 
• If the subject would withdraw after receiving the first dose of IP, AEs and SAEs shou ld be 
actively collected up until the latter , either ET visit or a follow -up visit/telephone interview 
(Section 7.1.4).  In addition, if the subject agrees to continue the follow -up of clinical -
associated outcomes until Week 56 ( Section 7.2.1), data collected until week 56  will be also 
recorded.  
• If the subject wou ld withdraw during the screening period, before  enrolment , and/or before
 
receiving the first dose of IP , AEs and SAEs should be collected up until the time the subject 
withdraws.  
Unresolved AEs should be followed up until Week 56 (EOS visit) or ET visit  (including a follow-up 
visit or telephone interview) , as available and consented to by the subject,  and the collected  follow -
up information will be recorded in the eCRF. The Investigator should observe the AEs for appropriate 
medical care of the subject u ntil AE resolution or stabilisation  up to Week 56 ( EOS  visit)  or ET visit  
(including a follow-up visit or telephone interview). 
8.1.4.  Reporting Adverse Events 
AEs are to be reported in the eCRF and reviewed by the Investigator. When reporting an AE, a 
diagnosis (when possible and appropriate), rather than each individual sign and symptom , should be 
reported. 
Each AE is to be assessed to determine if it meets the criteria of an SAE ( Section 8.2.1 for SAE 
definition). If an AE is classified as an SAE, it must be reported to the Sponsor, or its designated 
representative, promptly according to the timeline specified in Section 8.2.2. For an SAE, a diagnosis 
corroborated with a description of signs and symptoms as well as other supporting information (e.g., 
results of exam s) that led to the diagnosis should be described in the SAE report form and reported 
to the Sponsor, or its designated representative, according to the procedures described in  Section 
SB15 (proposed aflibercept biosimilar)  
SB15 -3001  
Version 1.0 , Oct 30 , 2019 
 
Samsung Bioepis – Confidential and Proprietary Information

8.2.2. 
8.1.5.  Severity Assessment  
The Investigator is responsible for assessing and reporting the severity of AEs.  
Following classifications should be used to classify AEs: 
• Mild events are usually transient and do not interfere with the subject ’s daily activities,  
• Moderate events introduce a low level of inconvenience or concern to the subject and may 
interfere with daily activities,  
• Severe events interrupt the subject ’s usual daily activities.  
8.1.6.  Causality Assessment  
The Investigator is responsible for assigning a causal relationship to each AE. The causal relationship 
between the IP and the AE should be defined as not related (no) or related (yes). 
Events should be classified as ‘related ’ if there is a reasonable possibil ity that the IP caused the AE. 
This means that there are facts (evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal relationship.  
Events should be classified as ‘not related ’ if there is no reasonable possibility that the IP caused the 
AE. 
8.1.7.  Emergency Unmasking for S afety Reasons and Accidental Unmasking  
During the study period after randomisation, emergency unmasking should be considered only when 
knowledge of the treatment group assigned to the  subject is deemed essential for the subject ’s safety 
by the Investigator. In such situations, emergency unmasking may be performed by the Investigator  
(or designee) through the IWRS system.  In case failure of unmasking through IWRS system, the 
Investigato r will follow the manual unmaking process described in IWRS manual. 
Overall, the Investigator  (or designee) is responsible for 1) identifying clinical courses or situations 
where the emergency medical care of a study subject requires knowledge of their masked treatment 
assignment, 2) implementing the emergency unmasking procedures with associated communication pathways, 3) documenting the reasons for unmasking and which parties were unmasked as appropriate, and 4) informing their local IRB /IEC and the Spons or of all subjects whose assignment 
was unmasked.  
Similarly, in case of accidental unmasking (i.e., accidental in that it occurred but it was not deliberated by the Investigator), as soon as the Investigator becomes aware that the treatment group assigned to 
a subject is unmasked, the Investigator should promptly document the accidental unmasking and inform the Sponsor and the CRO (within 24 hours) of the unmasking occurrence as well as of possible route causes, if information is available.  
In general, pertinent information regarding the circumstances of unmasking of a subject ’s treatment 
group must be documented in the subject ’s source documents. This includes who performed the 
unmasking, the subject(s) affected, the reason for the unmasking, the date of the unmasking , and the 
relevant IP information.  
Important note:
 Emergency or accidental unmasking is one of  the reason s for subject ’s 
discontinuation from study treatment ( Section 7.2.1 ).

Version 1.0 , Oct 30 , 2019 
 
Samsung Bioepis – Confidential and Proprietary Information  
Page 65 of 94 
 
8.1.8.  Expectedness Assessment  
Expectedness of AEs will be assessed by reference  safety information  (RSI)  in the Investigator ’s 
Brochure (IB). The latest SmPC of Eylea®, Annex I of EPAR Product Information posted on the EMA 
website ( https://www.ema.europa.eu/en ) will be used as reference when assessing the expectedness 
of AEs for the reference product after database lock and planned unblinding or emergency unblinding. 
8.1.9.  Withdrawal due to Adverse Ev ents 
Subject ’s withdrawal from the IP due to an AE should be distinguished from withdrawal due to 
personal reasons. Subjects withdrawn due to an AE are those who are discontinued from IP because, 
in the opinion of the Investigator, the risks related with the AE may outweigh the potential benefits 
of continuing the participation in the study. Thus, the decision of withdrawal due to an AE shall be 
taken by the Investigator in the subject’ s best interest due to safety reas ons. Subjects withdrawn due 
to an AE should be followed up for safety until the time  point specified in Section  8.1.3. If subjects 
cannot be followed, the reason (s) will be documented by the Investigator (e.g., lost to follow -up, 
withdrawal of subject ’s consent  to be followed up). When a subject withdraws from the IP  due to a 
SAE, the SAE must be reported and followed in accordance with the requirements  outlined in Section 
8.2.2. 
 Serious Adverse Events  
8.2.1.  Definition of Serious Adverse Event  
An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence at any dose that:  
• Results in death  
• Is life -threatening  
• Requires inpatient hospitalisation or prolongat ion of existing hospitalisation  
• Results in persistent or si gnificant disability/incapacity  
• Results in congenital anomaly/birth defects  
• Is medically important  
Medical and scientific judgement should be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting is 
appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be immediately life-
threatening or result in death or hospitalisation. However, if it is dete rmined that the event may 
jeopardise the subject and may require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition above, the important medical event should be reported as serious. Examples of such events are intensive treatment in  an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias , 
or convulsions that do not result in hospitalisation or development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
The term  ‘severe’ is often used to describe the intensity (severity) of a specific event (as in mild, 
moderate or severe myocardial infarction); the event itself, however, may be of relatively minor medical significance (such as severe headache). This is not the same as ‘serious’, which is based on 
subject/event outcome or action criteria usually associated with events that pose a threat to a subject ’s 
life or functioning.  
In addition, sight -threatening ocular adverse event will be reported as SAE if it meets one or more of  
the following criteria:

• A decrease in visual acuity  of ≥ 30 letters from the last assessment of visual acuity  
• A decrease in visual acuity  to the level of l ight perception or worse  
• Severe intraocular inflammation (e.g., 4+ anterior chamber cell/flare or 4+  vitritis)  
• Requirement of surgical intervention to prevent permanent loss of vision (e.g., vitrectomy, 
vitreous tap or biopsy with IVT injection of antibiotics, laser treatment, IVT gas injection, or 
retinal cryopexy) 
• In the investigator ’s opinion, medical intervention may be required to prevent permanent loss 
of vision 
8.2.1.1.  Life-threatening  
The term ‘life-threatening ’ in the definition of ‘serious’ refers to an event in which the subject was at 
risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have 
caused death if it were more severe.  
8.2.1.2.  Hospitalisation  
AEs reported from clinical studies associated with inpatient hospitalisation or prolongations of hospitalisation are considered serious. 
Any admission to a healthcare facility more than 24 hours meets these criteria. Admission also 
includes transfer within the hospital to an acute/intensive care unit (e.g., from the medical floor to a 
coronary care unit, neurological floor to a tuberculosis unit). Staying at the observation unit in the emergency room for more than 24 hours qualifies for hospitalisation. 
Any events leading to a subsequent emergency room visit or inpatient hospitalisation for less than 24 
hours may be regarded as medically important for its seriousness criteria, at the discretion of the 
Investigator based on medical judgement.  
Hospitalisation or prolongation of hospitalisation in the absence of a precipitating clinical AE is not in itself an SAE. Examples include: 
• Admission for treatment of a pre- existin g (prior to ICF signed) condition not associated with 
the development of a new AE or with a worsening of the pre-existing condition 
• Diagnostic admission (e.g., for work-up of persistent pre- treatment laboratory abnormality)  
• Social admission (e.g., study subject has no place to sleep) 
• Administrative admission (e.g., for a regular check -up) 
• Protocol- specified admission during a clinical study (e.g., for a procedure required by the study 
protocol) 
• Elective admission not associated with an AE (e.g., for elective cosmetic surgery)  
• Pre-planned treatments or surgical procedures  
: Pre-planned treatments or surgical procedures should be noted in the relevant source 
document for the individual subject.

8.2.2.  Reporting Serious Adverse Events  
SAEs will be collected as generally specified in Section 8.1.3  and, in case of ET visit, as detailed in 
Section 7.1.4. All SAEs must be reported to the Sponsor or its designated representative via eCRF 
SAE report form at least within 24 hours of the Investigator becoming aware of the ev ent. A paper 
SAE form can be used  as backup in every case when the electronic form would not be available.  
Date and time (wherever possible) of the Investigator becoming aware of the SAE will be recorded 
in the SAE form and source document as appropriate.  
In particular, if the SAE is fata l or life -threatening, the Sponsor must be notified immediately  (within 
24 hours) , irrespective of the extent of available AE information. This timeframe also applies to 
additional (follow -up) information that becomes available on previously forwarded SAE reports. The 
Sponsor will then apply expedited reporting procedures according to local and international 
regulations as appropriate.  
The Investigator is obligated to pursue and provide information to the Sponsor on all SAEs in 
accordance with the required reporting  timeframe of 24 hours from the Investigator ’s awareness. In 
addition, the Investigator may be requested by the Sponsor to obtain specific additional follow -up 
information in an expedited fashion. In general, this will include a description of the SAE, which 
should be provided in sufficient detail so as to allow for a complete  medical assessment of the case 
and independent determination of possible causality. Information on other possible causes of the 
event, such as concomitant medications and illnesses must be provided. In the case of a subject death,  
if an autopsy is performed upon consent from responsible parties, a summary of available autopsy 
findings must be submitted as soon as possible to the Sponsor or its designated representative. 
Follow- up information for the SAE should be actively sought and submitted by the Invest igator as 
the information becomes available.  
 Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESI)  
The following AEs in the study eye will be classified as AESIs in this study: 
• Intraocular pressure increase 
- New onset pre-injection IOP of ≥ 25 mmHg  
- Post-injection  IOP ≥ 35 mmHg  
• Any case of intraocular infection  (suspected infection)  such as endophthalmitis

• Subretinal haemorrhage with the size of 1 DA or more involving the centre of the fovea , or if 
the size of the haemorrhage is ≥ 50% of the total lesion area  
Other, non-ocular, AESIs include the following: 
• Arterial thromboembolic events including non- myocardial  infarction A TEs and cardiovascular 
ischaemic events  
• Non-ocular haemorrhage

 Reporting  Visual Acuity -related Adverse Event  
• A decrease in visual acuity of ≥ 15 letters from the last assessment of visual acuity should be 
reported as AE/SAE as appropriate  
• A de crease in visual acuity of ≥ 30 letters from the last assessment of visual acuity  should be 
reported as SAE . 
• A decrease in visual acuity  to the level of light perception or worse  should be reported as SAE  
 Pregnancy 
Any pregnancy, including those of female partners of male subjects treated with the IP, should be 
reported to the Sponsor. If the female partner of a male subject becomes pregnant, a written consent must be obtained from the female partner before collectin g any pregnancy -related information. All 
pregnancies associated with the subject, from the time the subject receives the first IVT injection of 
IP until either Week 56 (EOS visit) or ET visit,  should be reported to the Sponsor. Pregnancy reports 
should be submitted to the Sponsor within 24 hours from when the Investigator became aware of the pregnancy, using the pregnancy report form. 
Although pregnancy is not an AE, all pregnancies must be followed up every 2 months until 6-8 
weeks after the outcome of the pregnancy becomes available, unless the subject is lost to follow -up. 
The pregnancy outcome should be notified to the Sponsor by submitting a follow -up pregnancy report 
form. If the outcome of the pregnancy meets SA E criteria then the Investigator should report this case 
according to the SAE reporting process ( Section 8.2.2).  
 Independent Data and Safety Monitor ing Board  
An independent DSMB  will be assigned for this study. The DSMB will consist of external experts 
(e.g., physician, clinical pharmacologists , or biostatisticians) and will review the safety and 
tolerability data from the study at pre- specified intervals. The details of the safety data and time points 
for review will be described in the DSMB Charter and in the DSMB statistical analysis p lan (SAP ). 
In addition, an ongoing masked review of AEs, including clinical laboratory data will be continuously 
undertaken by the Sponsor medical monitor and pharmacovigilance team. 
9. Statistical Methods and Data Analysis 
Further information on the statistical meth ods to be used in this study will be provided in the SAP, 
which will be finalised prior to the database lock for reporting the main CSR. 
Statistical analysis and reporting will be performed as follows:  
• Interim safety analysis for independent DSMB meeting:  
A DSMB SAP, describing the methodology and presentation of results and access to results 
will be prepared as a separate document. The safety reports for the DSMB data review meetings will be prepared according to the DSMB SAP.  
The statistical analysis will be performed by an independent statistical reporting team and 
the results will be communicated to the DSMB directly by an independent unmasked statistician.  
• Main CSR:

SB15 -3001  
Version 1.0 , Oct 30 , 2019 
 
Samsung Bioepis – Confidential and Proprietary Information  
Page 69 of 94 
 
The main analysis will take place once all subjects complete the procedures at Week 24, or 
its corresponding visit. Available efficacy and safety data, PK, and immunogenicity data will 
be analysed and reported. 
At the time of this reporting, a limited number of identified individuals of the Sponsor or 
CRO will be unmasked for reporting purpose. However, subjects, Investigators, and other study personnel will remain masked throughout the entire study period. 
• Final CSR:  
The final analysis will take place after the last subject completes the procedures at Week 56 or the corresponding visit. All study data will be analysed and reported for final CSR. 
 Statistical Hypotheses  
This is a study to demonstrate equivalence in change from baseline in BCVA at Week 8 between SB15 
and Eylea®. The null hypothesis tested for the primary efficacy analysis is that either (1) SB15 is inferior 
to Eylea® or (2) SB15 is superior Eylea® based on a pre- specified equivalence margin.  
The equivalence between the two treatment groups will be declared if the 90% confidence interval (CI) 
of the difference is entirely contained within the pre -defined margin of [ -3 letters, 3  letters ]. The 90% 
CI of the difference between the changes from baseline in BCV A at Week 8 of the two treatment groups 
will be estimated fo r the Full Analysis Set (FAS).  
For the EMA submission, equivalence between the two treatment groups will be declared if the 95% CI of the difference is entirely contained within the pre -defined equivalence margin of [−3 letters, 3 letters]. 
The 95% CI of t he difference between the two treatment groups in relation to the change from baseline 
in BCV A at Week 8 will be estimated for the FAS.
 
 Analysis Sets 
The following sets will be used for the analyses performed in the study: 
• Randomised Set (RAN) consists of all subjects who receive a randomisation number at the 
randomisation visit.  
• FAS consists of all randomised subjects. Following the intent- to-treat principle, subjects will 
be analysed according to the treatment group they are assigned to at randomisation. However, 
subjects who do not have any efficacy assessment result after randomisation and do not receive 
IP during the study period will be excluded from FAS. 
• Per-Protocol Set (PPS) consists of all FAS subjects who have BCV A assessment result at 
baseline an d Week 8 without any major protocol deviations (PDs) that have impact on the 
BCV A assessment. Major PDs that will lead to exclusion from this set will be pre- defined prior 
to unmasking the treatment group assignment for analyses. 
• Safety Set 1 (SAF 1) consists of all subjects who receive at least one IP during the study period . 
Subjects will be analysed according to the IP received.  
• Safety Set 2 (SAF2) consists of all subjects in the SAF1 who receive at least one IP after 
re-randomisation at Week 32. Subjects will be analysed according to the IP received.  
• PK Analysis Set (PKS) consists of all subjects in the SAF 1 who participate in PK evaluation 
at PK investigational sites (PK subjects) and have at least one serum concentration data.

 Subject Demographic and Baseline Characteristics  
Subject demographics and baseline characteristics will be summarised by treatment group for the RAN 
and PKS. Continuous variables (e.g., age, weight, height) will be summarised with descriptive statistics 
(n, mean, standard deviati on [SD], median, minimum, maximum) and categorical variables (e.g., gender, 
race, ethnicity) will be summarised with frequency and percentage.  
Comparison between treatment groups in baseline characteristics will be performed using the chi -square 
test or F -test as appropriate. The results of these tests will be provided including the p-value only for 
descriptive purposes and will not be used as a formal basis to determine the factors to be included in 
primary or secondary efficacy analysis models. If baselin e imbalances are detected for any of the factors, 
additional analyses may be performed to adjust for these baseline differences.  
Relevant medical and ophthalmic history will be summarised by treatment group for the RAN. 
Duration of exposure to IP and numbe r of injections will be summarised descriptively  by treatment 
group for the SAF 1. Prior and concomitant medications will be summarised by treatment group with 
frequency and percentage.  
 Analysis of the Primary Objective  
The primary efficacy analysis will aim to demonstrate equivalence in terms of change from baseline in  
BCVA at Week 8 between SB15 and Eylea®.  
The primary efficacy analysis will be performed for the FAS with the change from baseline in BCVA at 
Week 8 using an analysis of covariance model with the baseline BCV A as a covariate and region ( or 
pooled centres ) and treatment group as factors. The equivalence between the two treatment groups  will 
be declared if the two-sided 90% CI of the diff erence of Least Squares mean  (LSMean ) of change from 
baseline in BCVA  at Week 8  is entirely contained within the pre -defined equivalence margin of [−3 
letters, 3 letters] . The same analysis will be performed for the PPS as a sensitivity analysis.  
For the E MA submission, the primary efficacy analysis will be performed for the FAS with the change 
from baseline in BCV A at Week 8 using an analysis of covariance model with the baseline BCV A as a 
covariate and region ( or pooled centres ) and treatment group as factors. The equivalence between the 
two treatment groups will be declared if the two -sided 95% CI of the difference of LSMean of change 
from baseline in BCV A at Week 8 is entirely contained within the pre -defined equivalence margi n of 
[−3 letters, 3 letters]. The same analysis will be performed for the PPS as a sensitivity analysis.  For 
those subjects who drop out of the study prematurely, a multiple imputation will be used under the missing at random assumption. The 95% CI of the difference between the two treatment groups will 
also be estimated for the FAS as supportive analysis.  
 Analysis of the Secondary Objective s 
9.5.1.  Efficacy Variable Analyses  
As the secondary efficacy endpoints, change from baseline in BCVA, CST , TRT , and CNV  area will be 
summarised descriptively by treatment group and visit.   
Proportion of subjects who lost fewer than 15 letters and gained 15 letters or more in BCVA compared to baseline, subjects with intra- or sub- retinal fluid, and subjects with active CNV leakage will be 
summarised descriptively by treatment group and visit.  
The two -sided 95 % CI of the LSMean difference of  change from baseline in secondary efficacy 
endpoints between the two treatment groups will be estimated.

9.5.2.  Safety Analyses  
Safety analyses will be performed for main  period, transition period, and overall study period unless 
specified otherwise . Analyses for main and transition period will be performed in the SAF1 and SAF2 
respectively and analyses for the overall study period will be perfor med in the SAF1. 
All reported terms for AEs (ocular or non-ocular ) will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for 
Regulatory Activities (MedDRA®). AEs including ocular AEs in the study eye and/or fellow eye as well 
as non-ocular AEs will be summarised descriptively by treatment group. Intraocular inflammation will 
also be summarised similarly.  
Change in intraocular pressure, vital signs , and clinical laboratory parameters will be summarised 
descriptively by treatment group and visit. All other safety va riables will be summarised descriptively 
by treatment group and visit unless specified otherwise. 
9.5.3.  Pharmacokinetic Analyses 
Blood sampl es for PK assessment will be collected in approximately 40 subjects participating in PK 
evaluation (20 subjects per treatm ent group  in initial randomisation at Week 0 [Day 1] ). The systemic 
exposure will be summarised descriptively by treatment group and visit. If fellow eye received Eylea® 
during the study period after randomisation, the concentration measured after treatment for the fellow 
eye will be listed, but excluded from the summary statistics.  
9.5.4.  Immunogenicity Analyses  
The number and proportion of subjects with ADA and NAb results (e.g., ‘positive ’ or ‘negative ’) will 
be summarised by treatment group and visit.  If fello w eye received Eylea® during the study period after 
randomisation, the ADA and NAb results obtained after treatment for the fellow eye will be listed, but excluded from the summary statistics.  
 Exploratory analyses  
Proportion of subjects with sub- RPE fluid on OCT at Week 32 and Week 56 will be summarised 
descriptively by treatment group and visit.  
For NEI VFQ -25 as a measurement of QOL, subscale scores (general health, general vision, ocular pain, 
near activities, distance activities, vision -specific social functioning, vision- specific mental health, 
vision -specific role difficulties, vision -specific dependency, driving, colour vision, and peripheral 
vision) and the composite score, which represent overall visual function, will be calculated, and the change from baseline will be summarised by treatment group and visit.  
 Sample Size Calculations  
For the calculation of the equivalence margin for BCV A, the mean changes in BCV A were referred from VIEW1 study of Eylea
® in subjects with neovascular AMD.  
In the VIEW1  study of SmPC  of Eylea®, the mean change of BCVA at Month 12 (SD) was 10.9 (13.8) 
letters for the dosing of 2 mg every 4 weeks  Eylea® treatment group and the LSMean  difference between 
Eylea® and Lucentis® (ranibizumab) with its 95% CI was 3.15 (0.92, 5.37) letters.  
The US FDA Guidance describes that if the active control (Eylea® in this  study) has shown superiority 
to other active treatments (Lucentis® in VIEW1) in the past, the difference demonstrated (3.15 letters) 
represents a conservative estimate of historical evidence of sensitivity to drug -effects, one that could 
serve as a basis for choosing M1. Therefore, the equivalence margin of 3 letters, wh ich would be less 
SB15 (proposed aflibercept biosimilar)

Page 72 of 94 
 
than the LS Mean difference in VIEW1 study, which proved  statistical superiority to ranibizumab.  
The ETDRS chart has 5 letters in one line (that is the minimum limit for visual acuity change) and thus 
the difference more than 5 letters in BCV A could be considered as a minimal clinically important 
difference. In addition, most of the anti -VEGF non -inferiority clinical trials on AMD also used a non -
inferiority margin of 5 letters . Therefore, the equivalence margin of [−3 letters, 3 letters] i s considered 
to be a conservative margin to test the clinical equivalence between SB15 and Eylea®. 
With the equivalence limit of [−3 letters, 3 letters], 216 subjects per treatment group was calculated 
with the assumptions of the mean difference of 0.5 letters and SD of 9.0 at the overall 5% significance level, providing 80% power to reject the null hypothesis. Overall 446 subjects (223 per treatment group) will give 216 completers per treatment group assuming a 3% loss from the randomised subjects . 
The nQuery Advisor
® option two one -sided equivalence tests (TOST) for two -group design gives the 
following statement to estimate the n per group to show the equivalence: “When the sample size in each 
group is 216, a two group design will have 80% power to reject both the null hypothesis that the test mean minus the standard mean is below -3 and the null hypoth esis that the test mean minus the standard 
mean is above 3 i.e., that the test and standard are not equivalent, in favor of the alternative hypothesis that the means of the two groups are equivalent, assuming that the expected difference in means is 0.5, the common standard deviation is 9 and that each test is made at the 2.5% level.” 
With the equivalence limit of [−3 letters, 3 letters] for the US FDA submission, 173 subjects per 
treatment group (overall sample size of 346) was calculated with the assumptions of the mean difference 
of 0.5 letter s and SD of 9.0 at the overall 10% significance level, providing 80% power to reject the 
null hypothesis.  
The nQuery Advisor
® option two one -sided equivalence tests for two -group design gives the following 
statement to estimate the n per group to show the equivalence: “ When the sample size in each group is 
173, a two group design will have 80% power to reject both the null hypothesis that the test mean minus the standard mean is below -3 and the null hypothesis that the test mean minus the standard mean is 
above 3 i.e., that the test and standard are not equivalent, in favor of the alternative hypothesis that the 
means of the two groups are equivalent, assuming that the expected difference in means is 0.5, the 
common standard deviation is 9 and that each test is made at the 5% level.” 
Therefore, the sample size of 446 allows enough power to detect the equivalence in both situations. 
10. Data Collection and Management 
 Data Confidentiality 
Information about study subjects will be kept confidential. Subject identification information will be 
labelled with a code number, and will not include the subject ’s name or other information that could 
identify them. A list linking the code and the subject ’s name will be kept in the investigational site files 
as required by International Council for Harmonisation ( ICH) E6 (R2) Good Clinical Practice ( GCP ) to 
protect the subject ’s confidentiality.  
The coded information will be sent to the Sponsor (or designee) who will analyse it  and report the study 
results both to regulatory and ethical authorities. The Sponsor may also place data on public websites 
or publish journal articles based upon these results. Subject names or other directly identifiable 
information will not appear on any reports, publications, or other disclosures of clinical study outcomes. 
Care will be taken to prevent subjects being identified through these publications. In addition, data may be shared with other companies or researchers to aid further research into AMD. Such data sharing 
practices will be covered by confidentiality agreements. No -one outside the investigational site will

have access to subject -identifiable information.  
 Monitoring  
The Sponsor has engaged the services of a CRO to perform all monitoring functions within this clinical 
study. The monitors will w ork in accordance with the CRO standard operation p rocedures (SOPs) and 
have the same rights and responsibilities as monitors from the Sponsor organisation. Monitors wil l 
establish and maintain regular contact between the Investigator and the Sponsor.  
Monitors will evaluate the competence of each investigational site and inform the Sponsor about any 
problems relating to facilities, technical equipment, or medical staff. D uring the study period, monitors 
will check that written informed consent has been obtained correctly from all subjects and that data are recorded correctly and completely. Monitors will also perform source data verification by comparing entries in the eCR F with corresponding source data and informing the Investigator of any errors or 
omissions. Monitors will verify adherence to the protocol at the investigational site. All protocol 
deviations will be reported to the Sponsor via the Monitoring Visit Reports. Monitors will arrange for the supply of IP and ensure appropriate storage conditions are maintained. 
Monitoring visits will be conducted at regular intervals according to ICH E6 (R2) GCP. The monitor 
will provide written reports to the Sponsor on each oc casion they make contact s with the Investigator 
regardless of whether it is by phone or in person. 
Further details on the monitoring processes and the level of source data verification to be performed 
will be outlined in the monitoring plan. 
 Data Handling and Record Keeping  
The Investigator must maintain essential study documents including protocol and protocol amendments, 
completed eCRFs, signed written ICFs and its revisions/updates, completed eCRFs, other relevant 
correspondence according to ICH E6 (R2) GCP, and other relevant study requirements (if applicable) 
until at least 2 years after the last approval of a marketing application in an ICH region and until there are no pending or contemplated marketing applications in an ICH region or at least 2 years after the 
formal termination of clinical development of the IP or 15 years from completion of the study, or whichever longer according to the relevant local laws and/or regulations. These documents should be retained for a longer period if required by the applicable regulatory requirements or the investigational 
site, institution or private practice in which the study is being conducted. Subject identification codes 
(subject names and corresponding study numbers) will be retained for the same period of tim e. These 
documents may be transferred to another responsible party, deemed acceptable by the Sponsor, and who 
agrees to abide by the retention policies. Written notification of transfer must be submitted to the Sponsor. The Investigator must contact the Sponsor prior to disposing of any study records and obtain 
written permission to do so.  
 Future Use of Stored Specimens and Data  
The Sponsor or designated representative can store PK and/or immunogenicity samples for maximum 
7 years after the end of the clinical study. The Sponsor or designated representative should operate under 
the same regulations related to and take the same responsibility to save personal data. The sample may be used for additional assay to be performed if  considered scientific relevant or requested by regulatory 
authorities in order to have the possibility to perform the assay . 
 Database Management and Coding 
Data generated within this clinical study will be handled according to the relevant SOPs of the dat a

management of the Sponsor (or an appropriate company designated by the Sponsor to perform these 
activities). The study eCRF is the primary data collection instrument for the study. Subject data will be captured in an eCRF and reviewed by the monitor in order to check adherence to the protocol and to detect any data inconsistency or discrepancy from source document.  
The Investigator must ensure that the clinical data required by the study protocol are carefully reported in the eCRF. He/she must also check that the data reported in the eCRF correspond to those in the 
medical records. The investigator will sign all collected data in eCRF.  
Data must be entered into eCRFs in English by the designated investigational site staffs in a timely manner. Source docume nts should be available during periodic visits by study monitors to enable review 
for completeness and acceptability. Any correction to the data entered into the eCRF must be carried 
out by the Investigator or a designated member of staff. These changes may be made either on the 
initiative of the investigational site staff or in response to monitoring or data queries. Any changes to 
written data must be made using ICH E6 (R2) GCP corrections and any change to electronic data should be made in a system which  can provide an audit trail. Monitors and clinical data managers will review 
the eCRF for accuracy and can generate queries to the investigational staff for resolution. Corrections will be recorded in an audit trail that records the old information, the new information, and identification of the person making the changes, date of correction made and reason for change. The Investigator must sign and date the eCRF pages as indicated.  
Medical/surgical history and underlying diseases and AEs will be coded using  MedDRA
®. Concomitant 
medications will be coded using the World Health Organisation- Drug Dictionary Enhanced (WHO -
DDE). The versions of coding dictionaries used will be stated in the clinical study report. 
 Quality Control and Quality Assurance  
During the conduct of the study, the Sponsor or its agent will conduct periodic monitoring visits to 
ensure that the protocol and ICH  E6 (R2)  GCP are being followed. The monitors may review source 
documents to confirm that the data recorded on the eCRFs ar e accurate. The Investigator and institution 
will allow the domestic and foreign regulatory authorities, sponsor ’s monitors and auditors ’ direct 
access to source documents to perform this verification. The investigational site may be subject to 
review by t he IRB/ IEC, and/or to quality assurance audits performed by the Sponsor, and/or to 
inspection by appropriate regulatory authorities. It is important that Investigators and their relevant 
personnel are available during the monitoring visits and possible audits or inspections and that sufficient 
time is devoted to the process.  
 Protocol Deviation  (PD) 
PDs will be pre- defined prior to subject enrolment and documented separately named as ‘protocol 
deviation definition list ’ which includes category (e.g., violation of inclusion/exclusion criteria, use of 
prohibited medication, non- compliance with treatment),  deviation description, severity (major or 
minor), time point for protocol deviations. Major PDs are defined as those deviations from the protocol 
likely to have an impact on the perceived efficacy and/or safety of study treatments.  
PDs will be reviewed an d confirmed prior to database lock to decide which subjects and/or subject data 
will be excluded from certain analyses. Decisions regarding the exclusion of subjects and/or subject 
data from analyses will be documented and approved prior to database lock.

11. Ethics Considerations and Administrative procedures  
 Institutional Review Boards  (IRB)  and Independent Ethics Committees  (IEC)  
The Investigator and the Sponsor will follow all local laws and regulations relating to conta ct with and 
approvals from IRB/IEC.  
The Investigator must provide the Sponsor with documentation of IRB/IEC approval of the protocol 
and written informed consent before the study may begin at the investigational site. The Investigator 
will supply documentation to the Sponsor relating to the annual renewal of the protocol from the 
IRB/IEC and any approvals of revisions to the ICF or amendments to the protocol. 
The Investigator will report promptly to the IRB/IEC any new information that may adversely affect 
the safety of subjects or the conduc t of the study. Similarly, the Investigator will submit written 
summaries of the study status to the IRB/IEC on a regular basis and in accordance with the timelines required locally. Upon completion of the study, the Investigator will provide the ethics committee with a report on the outcome of the study if required by local regulations. 
 Ethical Conduct of the Study  
This study will be conducted and informed consent will be obtained from each subject according to the ethical principles stated in the Declarat ion of Helsinki (2013), the applicable guidelines for ICH E6 (R2) 
GCP, and the applicable drug and data protection laws and regulations of the countries where the study 
will be conducted.  
 Written Informed Consent 
The written informed consent will be used to explain the risks and benefits of study participation to the subject in simple terms prior to any study related procedures. The written informed consent contains a statement that the consent is freely given, that the subject is aware of the risks and ben efits of entering 
the study, and that the subject is free to withdraw from the study at any time. Written consent must be given by the subject after the receipt of detailed information on the study. 
The Investigator is responsible for ensuring that informed consent is obtained from each subject and for 
obtaining the appropriate signatures and dates on the written informed consent prior to the performance 
of any protocol procedures and prior to the first IVT injection of IP. The Investigator will provide eac h 
subject with a copy of the signed and dated written informed consent and this will be documented in the subject ’s source notes. Depending on local regulation, authorized site staff can obtain the ICF 
subjects as well.  Before informed consent may be obtai ned, the Investigator, or a person designated by 
the Investigator, should provide the subject or the subject ’s legally acceptable representative ample time 
and opportunity to inquire about details of the trial and to decide whether or not to participate in the 
study. 
Prior to a subject ’s participation in the study, the written ICF should be signed and personally 
dated by the subject or by the subject ’s legally acceptable representative, and by the person who 
conducted the informed consent discussion. 
If the  subject is legal blindness or illiterate, an impartial witness should be present during the entire 
informed consent discussion. After the written informed consent and any other written information to 
be provided to subjects is read and explained to the subject /impartial witness , and after the 
subject /impartial witness  has orally consented to the subject ’s participation in the study . The subject (if 
capable of doing so ) and/or the impartial witness will personally sign and date the written informed 
consent . In case both subject and impartial witness will sign the ICF, the subject will sign first. In 
particular, b y signing the written informed consent, the impartial witness attests that the information in

the written informed consent and any other written inf ormation was accurately explained to the subject 
and apparently understood by the subject, and that written informed consent was freely given by the 
subject.  
 Investigator Information 
11.4.1.  Investigator Obligations  
This study will be conducted in accordance with the ICH E6 (R2) GCP , the ethical principles that have 
their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki (2013), and other local laws and/or regulations. 
The Investigator is the qualified physician who is responsible for ensuring that the study is conducted 
accor ding to the signed the Investigator statement, the study protocol and applicable regulations; for 
protecting the rights, safety and welfare of subjects under the Investigator ’s care; and for the control of 
drugs under investigation. The Investigator must obtain the written informed consent of each subject to 
whom IP will be administered. The Investigator is also responsible for supervising any individual or 
party who conducts study- related duties at investigational site to ensure the integrity.  
11.4.2.  Training of Investigator Site Personnel  
Before the first subject is enrolled into the study, a Sponsor representative will review and discuss the 
requirements of the Clinical Study Protocol and related documents with the investigational staff and will also train them in any study- specific procedures.  
The Investigator will ensure that appropriate training relevant to the study is given to all investigational 
site staff and that any new information relevant to the performance of this study is forwarded to the 
investigati onal site staff involved. 
The Investigator will maintain a record of all individuals involved in the study (medical, nursing , and

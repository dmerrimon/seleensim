Why is this research study being done?  
 
The purpose of this research study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a resiliency program 
for parents who have children with learning disabilities. We want to find out if this program is 
useful in decreasing s tress and enhancing coping skills in parents of children with learning 
disabilities.  
SMART -3RP is an eight -week psycho -educational resiliency  program that is designed to 
help individuals build resiliency and coping strategies against stress and negative thoughts. In

Subject  Identification  
several studies in other populations, researchers have found that SMART -3RP is effective in 
helping individuals identify and cope with stressors. In this study, we will be closely examining 
how the SMART -3RP program effects stress in parent s of children with learning disabilities . 
 
In total, we will run approximately 6 -8 groups in this study in its entirely.  
 
All participants will b e asked to complete a survey at 3 separate points in time: at study 
enrollment, at 3 month s post enrollment , and at 6 month s post enrollment . At 6 month s post 
enrollment , you may also be asked to give a hair sample to measure cortisol.   
 
 
 
How long will I take part in this research study?  
 
It will take you about 6 months to complete this research study. During this time, you will be 
asked to complete a survey at 3 points in time (now, at 3 months post enrollment, and at 6 
months post enrollment ). You will also participate in a n 8-session, 1  hour a week virtual 
SMART -3RP program within the 6 months you are in the study.   
 
 
What will happen in this research study?  
What will happen after you enroll...  
If you decide to take part in this research study, you will be assigned your own study 
identification number. This code is how you will be identified by study staff on study -related 
documents and samples. After enrolling in the study, you will be asked to fill out a baseline 
survey. The survey will ask you question s about demographic information and psychosocial 
factors. Surveys will be administered again at 3 months and  at 6 months post enrollment.  
 
Randomization:  In order to measure the effects of the intervention, you will  
be “randomized” into one of the study g roups after enrollment into the study: Immediate Group 
or Waitlist Control . The I mmediate Group will receive the study intervention within two weeks 
after enrollment into the study (baseline) . Randomization means that you are put into a group by  
chance. It  is like flipping a coin. You will have an equal chance of being  placed in either group. 
Both groups will receive the same intervention during  the course of the study, but at different 
time points.  
 
If you are assigned to the Waitlist Control group, enroll ment in the study (baseline) will be 
followed by apporoximately 3  months of waiting for the intervention. You would then be 
administered a second set of questionnaires (3 months post enrollment), followed by the

intervention and then have your final data collection (questionnaires and hair cortisol) at 6 
months post enrollment.   
 
If you are assigned to the Immediate Group, enrollment (baseline)  will be  
followed by the intervention (3  months). You would then be administered 3 month post 
enrollment question naires , followed by 3 months of continuing to practice what you learned  
during the intervention, and then by your final data collection (questionnaires and hair cortisol) 
at 6 months post enrollment . 
 
After you sign this consent form , you will be given your group assignment and a  calendar of 
your intervention schedule.  
 
Study Intervention:  Of note, the SMART -3RP as delivered here is a psycho -educational 
program  and is not being delivered as a clinical group.  
 
The intervention may consist of one intake with (either individually or in a group), and eight 
SMART -3RP sessions once a week over the course of 8 weeks (1 hour each). The intervention 
will be conducted by an experienced instructor who has utilized this program before and is 
comfortable with the co ntent. We may also offer optional booster sessions after the com pletion 
of the group.   
 
During the intervention, (and follow up period for those in the Immediate Group), you will be 
asked to practice what you’ve learned in the intervention. Additionally, y ou will be asked to keep 
track of your daily practice by filling out an online or paper log, which may be collected by study 
staff for data analysis following your completion in the program. During the 3RP session, the 
instructor will address any barriers or problems you may be having with daily practice and help 
to problem solve them with you.  
 
The program is a multimodal mind -body resiliency program that incorporates 3 core components 
into each session:  
1. Elicitation of the Relaxation Response through min d-body techniques  
2. Discussion about stress awareness to learn how to identify personal stressors and 
experiences of stress  
3. Coping strategies and adaptive perspective -taking to promote positive well being  
 
 
Videoconferencing Platform:  All visits will take pl ace virtually (meaning through a 
videoconferencing platform, similar to Skype or FaceTime) using a secure, HIPAA -compliant 
videoconferencing platform . The platform will be set up so that when you are looking at the 
screen during each session, you will see other members of the group and the provider(s) and they 
will see you as  well.

Subject  Identification  
 
At 3 months after joining the study:  
Surveys : At 3 months post enrollment, you will be asked to complete another set of surveys. The 
surveys will collect information similar to that collected at baseline, including demographic 
information and psychosocial factors.   
 
At 6 months after joining the study:  
Surveys : At 6 months post enrollment, you will be asked to complete a third set of surveys. The 
surveys will collect informati on similar to that collected at baseline and 3 months post 
enrollment.  
 
Hair Sample Collection : Additionally, you may be asked to provide a hair sample (approximately  
150 strands), which is about the diameter of a small paperclip after completion of the S MART -
3RP program. You will be provided with a stamped envelope to mail us your hair sample.  
 
Why hair sample?  Hair cortisol is the most accurate, non -invasive form of cortisol collection. 
This single hair sample will allow us to look at cortisol over the course of the study.  
 
Possible Storing of Samples and Health Information at MGH for Future Use : 
  
If we would like to store some of your samples and health information for future research. We 
will label your samples and health information with a code instead of your name. The key to the 
code connects your name to your samples and health information. The study doctor will keep the 
key to the code in a password protected computer.  
 
Do you agree to let us store your samples and health information for futu re research related to 
parental distress?  
 
 Yes   No  Initials ________  
If later you change your mind and want your samples destroyed, contact the study investigator . 
 
 
 
What are the risks and possible discomforts from being in this research 
study?  
 
There is a possibility that the SMART -3RP program will not work, you may not improve, and 
your parental stress may worsen. As with any research study, there may be other risks that are 
currently unknown. It is possible that certain unknown risks could be s erious. It is unlikely that 
participation in the current study would lead to worsening of stress.

Risks of Breach of Confidentiality of Study Information  
 
Potential risks for all participants include...  
1) Participants may feel distress from completing sur veys or participating in the 
intervention.  
2) In the event of a psychological emergency, confidentiality may be suspended if you are at 
risk for hurting yourself or someone else. Confidentiality may also be suspended in 
suspected cases of abuse or neglect of a child, elder, or person with a disability.  
 
We will require every participant to agree to respect the confidentiality of other group members. 
We will ask you to wear headphones during the group and not to repeat group discussions to 
others or outside of  the group.   However, because this program will be delivered virtually, we 
cannot guarantee that other group members will not share the content of the groups.  
 
 
What are the possible benefits from being in this research study?  
 
We cannot guarantee that you will receive any benefits from this study , however  participants in 
the current study may observe a  decrease in symptoms of parental stress . It is  hoped that the 
intervention will result in a statistically significant reduction of symptoms across these domains.  
 
The current study may provide support to parents  of children with learning disabilities  in 
developing new coping skills . This intervention may enhance our understanding of the role of 
mind -body interventions such as the SMART -3RP in parents  of children with learning 
disabilities. This intervention may have widespread implications for types of resources available 
that may ultimately improve he alth and well being of parents and children with learning 
disabilities.  
 
 
 
Can I still get medical care within Partners if I don’t take part in this 
research study, or if I stop taking part?  
 
Yes.  Your decision won’t change the medical car e you get within Partners now or in the future.  
There will be no penalty, and you won’t lose any benefits you receive now or have a right to 
receive.

PROJECT SUMMARY  
 
 Introduction and Purpose:  
The laryngeal mask airway (LMA) was invented in the 1980s and has been used in millions of patients worldwide.  Since that time, the original prototype has been modified in several ways in order to improve 
the design of the LMA.  “Second- generation” LMAs are those with a gastric channel, through which an 
orogastric tube can be inserted to decompress the stomach.  
 The LMA is associated with a decreased incidence of sore throat as well as a smoother emergence 
from general anesthesia compared to endotracheal tubes [1] .  In randomized studies comparing second 
generation LMAs with endotracheal tubes, patients have been shown to have less pain and postoperative nausea and vomiting with LMAs [2]. 
 In this prospective study, we plan to evaluate the use of a second -generation laryngeal mask airway 
(LMA) versus an endotracheal tube (ETT) in obese patients undergoing surgery.  The second-
generation LMAs offer additional benefits over traditional LMAs since they include a gastric channel 
through which an orogastric tube can be inserted to decompress the stomach.  Modifications in the cuff 
have been shown to decrease the incidence of sore throat and achieve higher seal pressures [3, 4].  
Some even include an integrated cuff pressure indicator, which allows the practitioner to assess inflation cuff pressures, therefore minimizing the incidence of over -inflation, which can cause mucosal ischemia 
and increase the incidence of sore throat [5]. 
 
 
Specific Aim 1:  
To compare the use of a second- generation LMA versus endotracheal intubation with respect to the 
incidence of hypoxia in the immediate postoperative period.  
 
Primary Hypothesis:  Patients managed with the second- generation LMA will have a 50% decreased 
incidence of hypoxia compared with patients managed with an endotracheal tube.  
 
Specific Aim 2:  
To determine the alterations in hemodynamics with insertion and removal of the LMA versus an endotracheal tube.   
 
Secondary Hypothesis:   The LMA will cause less hemodynamic alterations for insertion and removal 
compared to an endotracheal tube.

Page 4 of 16 Background:  
The laryngeal mask airway (LMA) was invented in 1983 and has been in clinical use since 1988 with 
millions of uses worldwide [6] .  It has a very good record of successful insertion and the learning curve 
for LMA insertion is not as steep as that for direct laryngoscopy and intubation [5] .  In a series of almost 
12,000 patients, LMA placement was successful in 99.8% of patients [7]. The LMA has a lower risk of 
airway complications since its placement does not necessitate laryngoscopy and its final position sits 
superior to the vocal cords and trachea, therefore causing less airway trauma [5] .  The LMA was 
designed for either spontaneous or controlled positive pressure ventilation (PPV).  In his first clinical series using the LMA, Dr. Brain described 16 cases of PPV in patients undergoing gynecologic surgery 
[6]. Use of the LMA in abdominal surgery, including laparoscopic gynecological surgery, has been 
documented in previous studies [8].  Newer, so called ‘second- generation’ LMAs have an additional 
gastric drainage tube, which allows passage of an orogastric tube to decompress the stomach.  This separation of the alimentary and respiratory tracts is a significant advantage of second -generation 
LMAs.  Additionally, higher airway pressures are afforded by these devices, which allow the provider to provide positive pressure ventilation without gastric insufflation. Therefore, these newer devices offer 
increased protection against aspiration when compared to first -generation LMAs.  When second-
generation LMAs are properly positioned, the risk of pulmonary aspiration is very low [9-11]. 
 Insertion of an LMA is significantly less stimulating than insertion of an endotracheal tube (ETT), as 
direct laryngoscopy is not required for LMA insertion [12, 13] .  Prior studies have shown that compared 
with ETT insertion, LMA insertion resulted in less hemodynamic and hormonal activation [14, 15] .  The 
stress of surgery itself promotes platelet aggregation and thrombus formation, thus predisposing 
patients to ischemic events in the perioperative period [16]. Catecholamines increase heart rate and 
blood pressure and therefore increase myocardial oxygen consumption. By decreasing the stress 
response associated with airway manipulation, the LMA may be advantageous compared to the ETT, 
especially for patients with comorbidities (e.g., obesity) that may predispose them to cardiovascular 
complications.  
 
LMA use results in less postoperative cough, laryngospasm, sore throat, hoarseness, and postoperative 
nausea and vomiting (PONV) compared to ETTs [2, 5, 8, 10, 17] . Additionally, use of a LMA compared 
to an ETT results in less postoperative hypoxemia and sore throat in the PACU [14] .  Excessive intracuff 
pressures can lead to pharyngolaryngeal complications including sore throat, dysphagia, and dysphonia 
[18, 19].  The modifications to the cuff of second- generation LMAs can decrease the incidence of 
postoperative pharyngolaryngeal symptoms [20] .   
  Patients who are managed with LMAs require less muscle relaxants than patients managed with ETTs.  
Upper airway muscles are very sensitive to the effects of residual neuromuscular blockade, increasing 
the risk of microaspiration, hypoxia, and pharyngeal dysfunction postoperatively [21, 22].  Being able to decrease the amount of neuromuscular blockade necessary could therefore result in less postoperative 
respiratory adverse events, especially in patients intolerant of residual neuromuscular blockade such 
as those who are obese.  Previous studies have used the LMA for successful ventilation of obese 
patients [23- 25].  
 In a recent Cochrane review of LMAs vs ETTs in obese patients, the authors concluded that there was 
a significant improvement in oxygenation during and after surgery, including better pulmonary performance of the second- generation LMA.  They also reported less postoperative coughing, 
suggesting a better recovery for patients [26] . Another prospective study evaluating the use of LMA vs. 
ETT in moderately obese patients undergoing peripheral surgeries concluded that the LMA group had 
better early postoperative lung function and pulse oximetry saturation compared with the ETT group 
[27].  
 
Compared to airway management with an ETT, the use of LMAs resulted in a shorter PACU stay and 
a faster discharge home [14] .  In a hospital such as Parkland with a busy surgical service and limited 
resources, the associated cost savings could be significant [28] .   
 
STU112015- 050, Moon, FormA -ResearchProtocol, Mod_15, 07 -28-21 (4)     
Page 5 of 16 There has been inconclusive evidence of whether obese patients have higher gastric volumes 
compared to lean patients but recent articles report that there does not seem to be a link between 
obesity and delayed gastric emptying [29-32]. Gastric ultrasound is a noninvasive tool to examine 
stomach contents at the bedside and is feasible in lean and severely obese patients [33, 34] . The antrum 
is highly amenable to ultrasound imaging and accurately reflects the content of the entire stomach [35] . 
A volume of < 1.5mL/kg suggests low gastric volumes and a low risk of aspiration [36] . 
  
Concise Summary of Project:  
This prospective, randomized, comparative study is intended to enroll a total of 150 obese patients with 
a BMI  >30 kg/m
2  undergoing surgery at Parkland Hospital.  There will also be a second site (MD 
Anderson) that will enroll an additional 150 obese patients. The efficacy and performance of the second-
generation LMA will be compared to endotracheal intubation.  A standardized anesthetic protocol that 
is usual and customary for the type of operation the patient is having will be provided to the anesthesia 
teams of enrolled subjects.  The remainder of the anesthetic care of the subject will not deviate from 
the standard of car e. 
 
 Study Procedures:  
Screening and Informed Consent  
A member of the research team will use a screening form to look for surgical patients that meet all the 
inclusion and exclusion criteria. He/she will approach potential subjects in the preoperative area and 
the study will be explained in detail in a private room.  Patients will be informed that they will receive no compensation for participating in the study and there will be no adverse consequences if they choose 
not to participate. If the subjects agree to participate, informed written consent will be obtained prior to 
any study procedures and this document will be sent to pmhresearchparticipants@phhs.org, for 
inclusion in the patient’s medical record, per Parkland regulations. The study duration will be from the 
beginning of anesthesia care to 2 hours aft er the patient’s surgery ends.  
 
Anesthetic Protocol  
The anesthesia team that will be caring for the subject during surgery will be given the protocol for the study, which standardizes the general anesthetic technique.   
 
Subject Group Assignment:  
A randomization schedule will be created by a member of the research team that is not involved in clinical care (i.e., statistician).  Subjects will be randomized to receive either a standard endotracheal 
tube or a second -generation LMA.  The ETT size will  be selected based on gender - 7.0 for women and 
8.0 for men.  LMA sizing will be according to manufacturer guidelines.   
 In the preoperative holding area, a gastric ultrasound will be performed to rule out the presence of 
significant gastric contents.  This will be done with a curved array low -frequency transducer on the 
current ultrasound machine that is already available in the preop area.  No visible contents in the gastric antrum in either the supine or right lateral decubitus (Grade 0) provides unequivocal diagnosis of an 
empty stomach.  A threshold of 1.5 mL/kg will be the upper limit of acceptable gastric volume.  Any 
patients who has more than this volume will not undergo any further study procedures.   
 
Once the patient is in the operating room, they will be positioned on the operating room table and 
standard ASA monitors will be applied.  All patients will undergo a standard anesthetic induction.  
Patients who are randomized to endotracheal intubation will also have a neuromuscular blocking agent 
(i.e., rocuronium) administered to facilitate intubation.  
 
Preparation of the endotracheal tube will consist of ensuring that the cuff holds air as well as inserting 
a stylet into the endotracheal tube.  Preparation of the LMA will consist of ensuring that the cuff holds 
air, and then withdrawing all the air in preparation for insertion, per manufacturer guidelines.  A water -
soluble lubricant will be applied to the dorsal surface of the LMA to assist with insertion, which is 
STU112015- 050, Moon, FormA -ResearchProtocol, Mod_15, 07 -28-21 (4)     
Page 6 of 16 standard practice.  
 
Following induction of anesthesia, if a patient is randomized to the ETT group, the anesthesia provider 
will perform a direct laryngoscopy and insert an endotracheal tube.  The time that the face mask is taken 
off the patient’s face will be recorded as the ‘start time’ for laryngoscopy, and the ‘end time’ will be when 
the positive ETCO 2 tracing appears.  For patients randomized to the LMA group, the anesthesia provider 
will be asked to insert the LMA in the patient’s posterior oropharynx until resistance is  encountered.  It 
will then be secured with a piece of tape, per manufacturer guidelines.  Then the cuff will then be inflated.  
The time that the face mask is taken off the patient’s face will be recorded as the ‘start time’ for LMA 
placement, and the ‘end time’ will be when the positive ETCO 2 tracing appears.  A fiberoptic 
bronchoscope will be inserted through the lumen of the LMA to ensure that its placement is correct (i.e., 
just proximal to the glottic inlet).  Correct placement of the LMA will also be tested with the gel 
displacement test [37, 38] . This test will be performed by placing 5 mL of water -soluble gel over the 
male drainage tube while occluding the female draining lumen and looking for its ejection during manual 
ventilation.  A ‘negative’ test (gel does not move) indicates that there is no air leak from the airway port 
to the gastric port, and the LMA is correctly positioned.  A ‘positive’ test (gel is displaced during 
ventilation) indicates that there is an air leak into the gastric port, and the LMA needs to be repositioned. 
Following confirmation of adequate ventilation, an orogastric tube will be inserted through the gastric channel of the LMA.  Correct gastric tube placement will be confirmed by aspiration of gastric contents 
(amount will be recorded) or by auscultation during insufflation of 30 mL of air into the gastric tube.  
 Successful LMA and ETT placement will be defined as chest rise during ventilation, a square 
capnography waveform, bilateral breath sounds, and no air leakage.  A maximum of three tries will be allowed for subjects in the LMA group.  If the LMA is not properly placed after 3 attempts, the anesthesia 
provider will be asked to intubate the patient with an endotracheal tube and a ‘LMA failure’ will be noted.  
Details regarding ETT placement including Cormack -Lehane grade, number of attempts, number of 
operations, and use of any adjunct airway devices will be recorded.  Following confirmation of LMA or ETT placement, the patient will be ventilated using volume control 
ventilation with an inspiratory:expiratory ratio of 1:2, tidal volume of 6- 8 mL/kg of ideal body weight 
(IBW) and a rate of 8 -12, titrated to keep the ETCO
2 between 35- 45 mmHg, and fresh gas flow rate of 
2 L/min.  Patients who are breathing spontaneously will be managed with pressure support ventilation 
(PSVPro).  Immediately after confirmation of LMA or ETT placement, the patient will be placed on 1- 2% 
sevof lurane in 50% oxygen.  
 Additional information collected will include:  
• Aspiration at induction  
• Amount and description of gastric fluid aspiration through orogastric tube suction (either through LMA or ETT)  
• Evidence of gastric content after airway device removal  
• Intraoperative medications  
• Medications given in PACU  
• Aldrete scores in PACU  
• Hypoxic episodes in PACU  
 
Vital signs including SpO
2, heart rate (HR), blood pressure (BP) will be recorded at the following times:  
- Baseline in operating room prior to induction 
- At induction (Ti)  
- Immediately after placement of LMA/ETT  
- Three minutes following placement of LMA/ETT  
- Five minutes following placement of LMA/ETT  
- Ten minutes following placement of LMA/ETT  
- Just prior to removal of LMA/ETT 
- Immediately after removal of LMA/ETT

A blinded research assistant will perform all postoperative assessments. All patients will go to the post 
anesthesia care unit (PACU) after surgery, unless an intraoperative complication necessitates that the patient go to the intensive care unit (ICU), at  which time they would no longer be a part of the study.  As 
patient -reported outcomes have become increasingly important for hospitals, treatments that have the 
potential to increase patient satisfaction are being studied closely.  The postoperative qualit y recovery 
scale (PQRS) is a tool that assesses recovery over time and compares them to baseline values.  Some of the advantages of the PQRS are that it is validated, takes less than 5 minutes to administer, has a low patient refusal rate, and is acceptable to patients across a wide range of ages. The PQRS will be 
administered at baseline in the preoperative area, and after PACU arrival at 15 minutes and again at 
45 minutes and 80 minutes (Appendix 1). The time when the patient arrives to the PACU, is ready  for 
discharge from the PACU (modified Aldrete score ≥9) and actual discharge from the PACU will be recorded.  
 After the first ten patients have been enrolled, the PI and the research team will review the cases to make any adjustments to the protocol to better facilitate data collection for the remaining study 
participants.

Recruitment Methods and Consenting Process:  
A member of the research team will approach subjects who meet all inclusion and exclusion criteria on the day of surgery in a private room.  All study procedures will be explained to the patient in layman’s 
terms.  If the subject agrees to participate, he or she will sign the consent form and HIPAA Authorization 
Form prior to any study procedures.  
 Potential Risks:  
There is some risk to subjects by participating in this study.  The anesthetic management of subjects 
will not differ from the standard care.  Patients will be randomized to be intubated with an endotracheal 
tube or have an LMA inserted as part of the airway management for their surgery.  There is a very small 
risk of aspiration anytime a patient undergoes general anesthesia.  A LMA is not considered a ‘secured 
airway’ because there is no cuff in the patient’s trachea.  Therefore, there is a risk of aspirat ion with a 
LMA.  However, the overall incidence of aspiration with general anesthesia is very low (approximately 
1 in 5000 general anesthetics) and no studies have been powered to look directly at aspiration. From 
existing studies, the LMA groups did not have a higher incidence of aspiration compared with the ETT 
groups [5, 39, 40]. One caveat is that patients at risk for aspiration have been excluded from these 
studies, which will also be done for this study.  Currently there is no evidence to suggest that the use of 
a LMA (especially a second generation LMA) in appropriately selected patients increases the risk of 
aspiration compared with ETT [27] .

Psychological Stress  
There is minimal risk for psychological stress to the patient as a result of participation in this study.  
Subjects may refuse to answer any of the questions, or take a break or stop participation in the study 
at any time.  
 
Subject Safety and Data Monitoring  
Study oversight will include a Data Safety and Monitoring Board (DSMB).  The DSMB will be chaired by a faculty member that is not the PI and will include specialists from different specialties including 
anesthesiology, critical care medicine, and surgery.  The DSMB will meet quarterly as needed to review 
all patient enrollments.  If necessary the DSMB will meet more often to review specific study subjects, unanticipated events, protocol violations, and adverse events.  All study subjects will be reviewed by  
STU112015- 050, Moon, FormA -ResearchProtocol, Mod_15, 07 -28-21 (4)     
Page 10 of 16 the DSMB for any study -related adverse outcomes.  A written record of all meetings will be kept.  The 
IRB will be notified in writing of any adverse study -related outcomes.  
 
Procedures to Maintain Confidentiality:  
A non- identifiable code will be assigned to the data collection sheet so that there is not a direct link to 
specific names.  Patient IDs will be standardized in chronological order as patient 1, patient 2, etc. A key to the coding system will be maintained in a locked storage cabinet with limited access until all the 
data is collected and analyzed. Access to study data will be restricted to authorized study personnel only. Following the completion of the analysis and the project, the key to the coding syste m or subject 
identifiers themselves will be destroyed by shredding the documents so that there is no direct or indirect link to subject identifiers and information.  
 
All data from the study will be kept on encrypted computers belonging to the University, which are stored 
in secured areas. All electronic study data will be password protected and passwords will be changed 
on a regular basis. Patient data will be analyzed  without patient identifiers by assigning study ID subject 
numbers that are de- linked from patient identifiers.  Signed consent forms, HIPAA forms, and study 
questionnaires will remain in a locked cabinet in the PI’s office.  
 
 
Potential Benefits:  
Previous studies have shown that appropriately selected patients who undergo surgery with a LMA (compared to an ETT) have less pulmonary physiological derangement in the postoperative period, as 
well as less pain and postoperative nausea and vomiting.  Pat ients who are randomized to the LMA 
group may benefit from this.  However, the study is not intended to directly benefit patients in either 
group (LMA vs. ETT).   
 
Data Sharing  
Data will be shared via RedCap; UT Southwestern PI will have access to the MD Anderson deidentified RedCap database and download an Excel data file. UT Southwestern will receive the deidentified data.  
 UT Southwestern team who have access to MD Anderson Center RedCap will download the 
deidentified data. RedCap ( https://redcap.mdanderson.org
) is hosted on a secure server by MD 
Anderson Cancer Center’s Department of Oncology Care & Research Information Systems. RedCap 
has undergone an annual Governance Risk & Compliance Assessment (since May 2014) by MD 
Anderson’s Information Security Office and found to be compliant with HIPAA, Texas Administrative 
Coes 202- 203, University of Texas Policy 165, federal regulations outlined in 21CFR Part 11, and 
UTMDACC Institutional Policy #ADM0335.  
 Those having access to the data include the study’s PI and research team personnel of both study sites. 
Users are authenticated against MDACC’s Active Directory system. External collaborators are given 
access to the database once approved by the PI, with their access expiring in 6 months, but renewable 
in 6 month increments at the request of the PI. The application is accessed through Secure Socket 
Layer (SSL).  
  Statistics:  
The study is powered to detect a change in the incidence of sore throat post -operatively between 
subjects in the ETT and LMA groups.  Assuming a 20% rate of incidence of sore throat in the ETT 
group, the study is powered to detect a 50 % reduction in the incidence rate to 10% (risk ratio = 1/ 2) in 
the LMA group.  With these assumptions, the study will need a total of 116 patients to have 80% 
power (two- sided chi -square test with type I error rate = 0.05).  To account for patient dropout, a total 
of 150  patient s will be enrolled .  The continuous data will be summarized as mean and standard 
deviation or median and inter -quartile range, as appropriate while categorical data will be summarized 
as frequency and percentages.  The incidence rates of sore throat in the two groups will be compared

This study  is designed to  test the efficacy  and the cumulative  toxicity of intrathecal  (administered  
through Ommaya reservoir) 131I-3F8 in children  and adult  patients with GD2 -expressing central  
nervous  system/leptomeningeal neoplasms.   Survival  is extremely poor  in these patients,  with 
median survival  of only a  few months. In a prior phase  I trial, 2 of  13  patients had negative  
remain  alive  and in complete remissi on after 4 years.  Patients in this protocol  will receive 
intrathecal  131I-3F8  weekly  for a total of four treatment  cycles.  About  130 p atients will be 
accrued  on this study. The  primary  endpoint  is overall  survival  at six months.  
 
2.1 Objectives and Scientific  Aims  
 
• To determine whether, in patients  with GD2 -expressing central  nervous  
system/leptomeningeal neoplasms, the activity  of intrathecal  131I-3F8  is sufficiently  
promising to  warrant  further study. Promising  activity  is defined as  a 6 month  overall  
survival  rate of 25% or more.  
 
• To determine the  response  rate to 131I-3F8 in this population. 
• To determine the  cumulative  toxicities of serial  injections  of intrathecal 131I-3F8. 
 
• To describe the effects  of HAMA (human -anti- mouse  antibody) on cerebrospinal  fluid 
(CSF)  and serum  pharmacokinetics following  multiple  injections of 131I-3F8 
 
3.1 Background  and Rationale  
 
3.2 Disease  background  
 
With the central  nervous  system  as a sanctuary  site, it is increasingly  recognized  that 
improved treatment of systemic  cancers  is associated with  a higher  incidence of central  
nervous  system  relapse and neoplastic  meningitis1-3. By the time  neuraxis  metastases  are 
clinically  evident, limited  palliative  options  exist;    median  survival  time for most  
malignancies  is 4-14 months2,4,5.  Stereotactic r adiosurgery for small,  single  metastases  
(<4cm diameter), surgery for solitary metastases and radiotherapy are used for palliation. 
New techniques including  preoperative  functional imaging, image-guided neurosurgery,  
intraoperative  ultrasound and cortical  mapping  have improved the success  of aggressive  
surgical resection,  and lowered  the associated  surgical  morbidity and mortality6,7. 
However, novel  therapeutic agents  that may prevent  or delay  the progression of disease  
are needed  to improve overall  outcome.

Tumor-selective radioimmuno therapeutic strategies may have  potential in inhibiting  
leptomeningeal  tumor  growth8-10. The  systemic a dministration of tumor specific  
monoclonal antibodies  has proven  useful  in the detection and targeted  treatment  of ma ny 
human tumors11,12. GD2  expression has  been  demonstrated in neuroblastoma, small cell 
lung cancer,  retinoblastoma,  melanoma,  high grade as trocytoma, medulloblastoma, 
osteosarcoma, desmoplastic small round blue cell tumor, and other sarcomas. Expression 
in normal human tissue  is limited  to nervous  tissue.  3F8 is a murine  IgG3  antibody 
against  GD2.  The intravenous  administration  of 3F8 has proven anti-tumor  effects  and 
has been  incorporated  into treatment strategies  improving the  disease-free survival  for 
patients  with metastatic neuroblastoma  since 198913. Acute  side effects  including pain 
and urticaria  are manageable.  No long-term side effects  have been  observed over a 15 
year period.  3F8  is easily  labeled  with  131-I, enabling  sensitive  and accurate imaging14. 
 
3.4 Results  of Phase  I Intraventricular 131 -I-3F8 
 
3.4.1 Dosimetry  
 
We studied  the radiation  dose to the CSF  following i ntraventricular injection  of 131I-3F8 
in patients  diagnosed with GD2-positive LM disease, compared  radiation dose estimates  
by CSF sampling  and ROI (regions of interest)  analyses,  and monitored acute and chronic 
toxicities following drug administration  in a phase I  study. Fifteen  patients (ages  1-61) 
received  a tracer  dose (37-74 MBq, 1 -2 mCi) and a second therapeutic injection  (370-740 
MBq, 10- 20 mCi).   Dosimetry was evaluated by whole-body ga mma  camera scanning  
(4, 24, 48 hours), s erial CSF and  blood sampling. Pre - and post - treatment clinical, 
radiographic and cytologic status  were evaluated.  Total  absorbed dose  to the CSF was  
1.12 – 13.0 Gy,  3.2 – 41.5 Gy  to the ventricles  and 1.0 – 13.7 Gy  to the spinal  column. 
Clearance  half- life was 12.5 hr (3.5 - 44 hr).  Average ratio of the therapy/tracer  
administration (Gy/MBq), was 0.88 (±0.58)  and 1.08  (±0.66)  by CSF counting and  ROI  
analysis,  respectively.

3.4.2 Pharmacokinetics  
 
Peak  CSF radioactivity  was generally achieved  within  the first hour of injection.  After an initial 
antibody redistribution  phase  within  the CSF compartment,  the CSF biological  half- life was 3- 
12.9 hours  by direct  CSF samples, and was in close agreement  with the CSF gamma camera  
estimates  derived  from  region of interest  data (7.2-13.1 hours). The average radiation dose to 
the blood was 0.48 Gy (0.14- 1.3). Activity  levels  in the blood remained  low (<0.01%  injected  
dose/cc),  peaking 12-48 hours. The activity  in the CSF fell much  more  rapidly  than the physical  
half- life of 8 days;  the concentration  of the activity  (uCi/cc)  dropped by two orders  of magnitude  
within  2-3 days after administration. The dose contribution for the time interval  72 hours  to 
infinity was  less than 10 %. 
 
3.3.3 Acute toxicities 
 
No toxic deaths  were associated  with treatment. Acute toxicity  including  headache,  fever,  
vomiting  were self- limited  are generally  observed in the first 24-48 hours  after therapy.  At the 
higher  dose levels,  transient  elevations in intracranial  pressure  (n=1),  asymptomatic  bradycardia 
(n=1)  and chemical  meningitis  (n=1)  were seen.  All symptoms  resolved  within  the first 2-7 days 
post therapy. No long term  toxicities have been  seen 19 months  post- injection.

3.3.4 Response  
 
Although not the primary  objective  of this study, of 13 evaluable patients,  clinical  improvement  
(n=2, patient #1, patient #6), radiographic  improvement  (n=2, patient  #1, patient  #13), and 
cytology clearing of  malignant  cells (n=2 patient  #11, pa tient # 13) was observed.  
Patient #11 cleared CSF of malignant cells after therapy  administration,  but was observed  to 
have a new spinal  metastasis  1 month after treatment. She is alive with disease  now 19 months  
since treatment.  
 
 
Patient #14 cleared  the CSF of malignant  cells immediately  after injection and has remained  off 
further therapy with negative  CSF cytology by Ommaya  and lumbar  puncture  sampling  on 
multiple  samplings  over a 14 month period; resolution  of 3 areas  of enhancement  on MR 
imaging  was also noted. Patient  #14 had an isolated  CNS  relapse of neuroblastoma.  He was 
treated  with surgery, chemotherapy, cranio-spinal radiation therapy, intraventricular  131-I-3F8 
and intravenous  3F8. He remains  in complete remission now 28 months  since relapse and >1.5 
years  post-131I-3F8.

Although all patients  had CSF flow throughout  the subarachnoid space,  variability  in CSF flow 
dynamics  were  noted  on baseline Indium  –DTPA  studies. Such variability  may be attributed to 
prior  therapies,  the presence  of bulk and microscopic  disease,  or the presence of an indwelling  
shunt  all affecting  CSF flow and reabsorption.  This may in part account  for the interpatient  
variability  in CSF dosimetry  and clearance is this diverse  patient  population. Although no 
patient in this study had measurable serum  human- anti- mouse  antibody (HAMA)  titers  at the 
time of treatment, this would  contribute to faster  clearance in the systemic  circulation and 
decreased  dose to the blood. Previous  experiments  have  shown that, because  of the blood-brain 
barrier,  systemic  production of  HAMA is associated with low titers  in the CSF,  namely a  14-22 
fold difference of HAMA in the CSF versus  the blood. In the presence of systemic  HAMA,  serial  
injections  of intrathecal  131I-3F8are expected  to deliver  comparable doses  of radiation to the CSF 
space,  but with even  more  rapid  systemic  clearance. This observation is critical since 
myelosuppression has  been  the dose- limiting  toxicity of most  radioimmunotherapy trials to date.  
We concluded  from  the phase I study that intraventricular administration of 131I-3F8 targeting  
disialoganglioside  GD2  achieves a favorable  CSF to blood ratio, is associated  with significant  
but manageable acute toxicities,  and may have clinical  utility  in the treatment  of some  patients 
with GD2-positive LM cancers.  
 
There are few other  therapeutic options  to offer this patient population. This study fills  an unmet  
need at this institution for  both pediatric  and adult  patients and capitalizes  on Memorial Sloan- 
Kettering‟ s Cancer  Center‟s  unique  contribution to the field of targeted  immunotherapy.  
 
3.4      Preliminary  Results  of phase  II study:  initial cohort  of patients  
8 of 10 patients  treated  with 4 injections  of  131I-3F8 as a consolidative  therapy  following  
various  chemotherapy or external  beam  radiotherap  y doses  remain  alive  and in cytologic and 
radiographic  remission  (3 mo+, 8 mo+,  10 mo+, 12 mo+,  12 mo+,  12 mo+,  18 mo+,  22 mo+).  3 
of these patients had CNS  neuroblastoma, and remain  alive  and in remission 11 mo, 15 mo and 
24 mo since detection of CNS  disease. This is significant  in that the median  time to death  from  
the onset  of CNS  disease was 5.4 months  in our previously published non- intra-Ommaya  therapy  
experience.  3 patients with active disease progression at the time of study enrollment  all had 
radiographic  progression of disease after 1 injection.  Toxicities  included  self- limited  headache,  
fever,  and vomiting  generally  resolved within  24-48 hours. No late toxicities have been  seen in 
the 5 patients  who remain  in remission off therapy  for >1 year since 131I-3F8 injections. Accrual  
is ongoing. These results  support  the need to continue  this study in a larger  cohort  of patients,  
with the goal of decreasing the time between  injections and further  decreasing the toxicity profile  
by increasing  the specific  activity.  
 
 
 
4.1 Overview of Study/Design Intervention 
 
4.2 Design  
This is a phase II single -arm open-  label  study that will define  responses  to therapy  with 
weekly  intrathecal 131I-3F8 in patients  with central  nervous  system/leptomeningeal GD2 - 
expressing disease.  Dosimetry  at plaques  of disease and surrounding normal  tissues will be 
determine d by a pre-treatment 131I-3F8 (2 mCi) scintigraphy. Pharmacokinetics of the dosimetry

Page  8 of 23  
  
 
dose of intrathecal  131I-3F8 will be determined  by measurements  of counts  per minute  (cpm)  of 
serial CSF and serum  samples.  
Patients  will then receive  intrathecal 131I-3F8 treatment  cycle  (10 mCi/cycle) approximately 
weekly  for a total of 4 cycles.   A total dose of 40 mCi 131I-3F8 will be administered.  Since  the 
phase  I study demonstrated a CSF dose  of 15-60 cGy/mCi  to the CSF,  maximum  total anticipated 
CSF dose of  4 x 10 mCi of 131I-3F8 injections  would be  600-2400 cGy;  dose to  the spinal  cord and  
normal  brain  is negligible  given the short  range  path length  of 131I.  At an estimated  tumor to CSF  
dose ratio of 5:1, tumor dose could  be as high as  3000 -12000 cGy.   Myelosuppression is not 
anticipated  at this dose level.  The chosen  40 mCi maximum 131I dose is considerably lower  than 
the MTD  reported  using other  intrathecal  131I-monoclonal antibodies for neoplastic meningitis  on 
other  phase  I studies.10   To avoid the risk of radiation toxicity  in patients who have had previous  
craniospinal radiation,  the CSF radiation dose delivered by 131I-3F8 therapy  injections  will not 
exceed   2400 cGy based  on the CSF dosimetry  estimates  from  pre-treatment 131I-3F8 / 
scintigraphy scans.  This may require  the elimination  and/or  dose r eduction of the 3rd or 4th  
injection for patients  who have had previous craniospinal  radiation. There will be no dose  
modifications  for patients  who have not had craniospinal  radiation. Response  to therapy  will be 
assessed  by n eurologic examination, radiographic  imaging  and CSF cytology analysis. Other  aims  
will be met by m onitoring patients clinically and  biochemically  for toxicity  and by serum  
assessment  of HAMA.  
 
It is quite  possible that 131I-3F8 may  lead to disease stabilization  without  complete  or 
partial  responses  in this population with  advanced  disease.  We therefore propose  overall  survival  
at six months  as the primary  endpoint  of this study. Leptomeningeal  disease  is rapidly fatal.  
Though some  prior studies  have reported  survival  at six months  of around 15%  these included 
patients  receiving  chemotherapy. Patients  receiving  131I-3F8 at MSKCC  have completed  all 
chemotherapy  and are not anticipated to have  further  oncologic treatment after progressing on 
this protocol. If 131I-3F8 has zero effect,  we would  therefore expect  no more  than 5% of patients  
to survive  for six months.  We will therefore  use 5% overall  survival  at six months  as the null 
hypothesis  with 25% overall  survival  at six months  as the alternative  hypothesis.

1-3 years: 33% dose reduction/injection 
>3 years:  Full dose 10 mCi 131I-3F8 per injection  
* Dose  adjustments  for patients with previous craniospinal  radiation: The total maximu m target  
CSF dose will be 2400  Gy. This may require a decrease or elimina tion of the 4th injection  to 
prevent  the risk of radiation toxicity  for these patients. No dose adjustment  will be made  for 
patients  who have  not received  prior craniospinal radiation.  
 
4.3 Intervention 
Patients  will receive 10mCi intrathecal  131I-3F8 per week.  Patients will be  pre- medicated  
with dexamethasone to prevent possible meningeal inflamma tory reaction, Liothyronine and 
SSKI  to prevent  thyroid accumulation, and acetaminophen  and diphenhydramine  in anticipation 
of possible allergic reaction and fever.  
4.2.1 Clinical Evaluation 
Patients  will have pre- and post-treatment clinical assessment  including neurologic  examina tion, 
hematology and serum  chemistries,  and CSF analysis.  Patients  without  objective  disease  
progression and without  unexpected  grade  4 toxicity  (controllable  fever,  headache,  nausea, 
vomiting  not included) will be eligible  for a total of  4 treatment  cycles. No patient  will receive  
more  than 4 treatment cycles.  
4.2.2 Response  
MRI studies will be obtained at baseline  and after the last injection.  Stable disease may be an 
indicator  of response,  since  most  patients  with leptomeningeal cancers  (especially  those  with 
visible disease) historically  die within a  short  time (4 weeks).  
4.2.3 Dosimetry  
Pharmacokinetics  and dosimetry of the dosimetry dose of intrathecal  131I-3F8 will be  determined  
by measurements  of counts  per minute  (cpm)  of serial CSF and serum  samples and serial  
scintigraphy images  obtained at approximately 4, 24 and 48 hours  after injection.  Dosimetry  
estimates  will be calculated  by M edical Physics  physicists in the Dept  of Nuclear  Medicine.

Page  12 of 23  
  
 
shunt  tubing has confirmed  acceptable CSF flow,  the shunt  may be used for the administration of 
131I-3F8. Patients  can be treated  in an outpatient setting  or may be hospitalized  overnight  for 
supportive care after  each injection.  All patients  will be monitored  in accordance with Radiation 
Safety Guidelines. Patients are not anticipated to need isolation post-treatment.  
9.2 Premedications for 131I-3F8 
The following pre-medication guidelines  are strongly  suggested, but may be altered based  on the  
clinical  judgment of the investigators  without  being  considered a  protocol  violation.  
 
To start  about  5 da ys prior  to the test dose with  131I-3F8:  
SSKI:  7 drops  daily  (to begin  5 days  pre- injection  and to continue  for 2 weeks  after the last 
injection)  
 
Liothyronine (Liothyronine): 25 mcg/day if  weight  less than 25 kg, 50 mcg/day if  weight  greater  
or equal  to 25 kg (to  begin 5 days  pre-injection and to continue  for 2 weeks  after the last 
injection)  
 
To start  1-2 da ys prior  to each injection:  
 
Dexamethasone (for those  patients not already  on a higher  dose of dexamethasone):  0.5 mg po 
bid if weight  less than 15 kg, 1 mg po bid  if weight  greater  than or equal  to 15 kg (to begin  about  
24 hours  pre- injection  and to be tapered  over  ~1 week)  
 
To be started  about  1 to 2 hours  before each injection: 
 
Hydroxyzine (Vistaril): 1 mg/kg IV, then Q 4 hours x 24 hours post- injection (maximum  50 mg). 
 
Acetaminophen (Tylenol):  10 mg/kg po before  injection and then Q4 hours  x 24 hours  post- 
injection (maximum  325 mg) 
 
Lorazepam  (Ativan):  0.05 mg/kg IV x 1 (maximum 1mg)  
 
Hydromorphone (Dilaudid): 0.015 mg/kg/dose  x 1, then PRN  (maximu m 1mg)  
 
9.2.1  Intraventricular administration of all drugs 
The antibody 3F8 is radiolabeled with iodogen method under  the supervision of Dr. S Larson  and 
J Lewis  according  to the FDA  requirements  specified  by the IND.  All patients  will have an 
intraventricular reservoir (i.e. Omma ya reservoir).  The Omma ya catheter  site will be prepped  
and draped. A  volume  of CSF equal  to the volume  of drug to  be injected  will be removed, the  
drug will be injected  slowly so  as not to exceed  a rate of 1ml/min.  Sterile  HSA will be flushed  
into the reservoir  followed by autologous CSF flush.  After 131I-3F8 dosimetry injections, 
patients  will have approximately  0.5 cc CSF and 1-2 cc blood obtained for radioactivity  levels  at 
approximately, 1 hr, 2 hr, 4-6 hr, 18-24 hr,  44-48 hr,  66-72 hr and ~5-7 days  post injection.

9.3.1 * Dose  adjustments  for age <3 years  based  on CSF  volume: 
< 1year:  50% dose reduction 
1-3 years:  33% dose reduction 
>3 years:  Full dose, 10 mCi 131I-3F8 per injection  
+averaging  approximately 5 mCi of radioiodine/mg 3F8 
* Dose  adjustments  for patients  with prior craniospinal  radiation:  
The total maximu m target  CSF dose by 131I-3F8 injections  will be 2400 Gy for patients  with 
prior  craniospinal  radiation  based  on 131I-3F8/  scintigraphy  dosimetry   estimates.  This may 
require  a decrease or elimination  of the 3rd or 4th injection  to prevent  the risk of radiation toxicity 
for these patients.  
 
 
9.3.2 Dosimetry  will be assessed  by 
 
*CSF and blood ( 2 ml/sample) obtained for radioactivity levels at approxima tely, and 1, 2, 4, 18, 
and 44 hours  after 131I-3F8 dosimetry injection.  (CSF  samples  obtained here are for research  
purposes).  At the time  of 131I-3F8 scintigraphy analysis,  routine dosimetry estimations will be 
derived  from  the serial  scintigraphy  studies  at approximately 4, 24, and  48 hours.  
Pharmacokinetic data obtained from  scintigraphy will be used in conjunction with  direct  
counting of CSF and blood samples  in a well scintillation  counter, and  combined  with MRI  
anatomical  imaging  to estimate  the absorbed  dose  to brain, CSF space,  blood and  visible tumor  
nodules.  
 
9.4 Tumor  genetic studies 
 
9.4.1 Tumor DNA and matched  normal  DNA will be used for genomic  DNA  sequencing, 
copy number  analysis  and methylation profiling;  tumor  RNA will be used for 
transcriptome and microRNA  profiling. The samples will not have any associated  patient- 
specific  identifying information,  but will be linked  to clinical  information  such  as patient  
age, gender,  tumor  stage,  tumor  recurrence status,  and tumor  site.  The identity of 
individual  patients  will be kept in a secure database registered  with the Office of Clinical  
Research,  under  the supervision of Dr. Modak according  to HIPAA  regulations.  This 
testing will be done  in Dr. Cheung‟s  Lab (Z740).  These  tests will be done  only on the 
tumor  left over after testing  for 3F8 binding.  
 
9.4.2 Immunohistochemical profile:  Frozen  tumors  will collected to  be tested  for tissue  
antigens  and gangliosides  [including but not limited  to GM2,  GD2,  GD3].   These tests 
will only be done  on patients  whose  tumors are not known to  bind  to 3F8, and  therefore 
are consented  to the assessment arm of the protocol.

10.3 Pharmacokinetic Studies 
Study of the intrathecal pharmacokinetics  and blood pharmacokinetics of the 131I-3F8 dosimetry 
dose will be performed.  Patients  will have approximately  0.5cc  of CSF obtained  pre- injection, 1 
hr, 2 hr, 4-6 hr, 18-24 hr, and 42-48 hr post injection.  Blood samples  (2 cc of plasma)  will be 
obtained at the time of CSF sampling, and may be obtained via a central  venous  catheter  (if 
present)  or an indwelling  heparin  lock venous  catheter.  Additional samples may be collected  if 
needed  to adequately  characterize pharmacokinetics.  Radioactivity  will be counted in a gamma  
counter. The count  information will be used for pharmacokinetic data. 
10.4 Scintigraphy 
Patients  will have the CNS  (head   and  upper  spinal  cord)  imaged   by 131I-3F8 scintigraphy 
approximately 4, 24, 48 hours.

10.5 Concomitant  Therapy:  
Patients  may receive systemic  chemotherapy starting  3 weeks  from  the second injection of 131I- 
3F8. Patients  must  wait at least 3 weeks  before  they can resume injection 3 or 4. This will allow  
assessment  of response  while  avoiding widespread  progression  of systemic disease.  
 
 
11.0 Toxicities/Side  Effects  
 
11.1 Toxicities will be assessed via the NCI toxicity criteria (CTC 3.0). All toxicities will be 
recorded  in CRDB until 30 days  after the last dose of 131-I-3F8. 
11.2 Toxicities associated with 131I-3F8 include fever, headache, nausea and vomiting, pa in 
allergic reaction, and/or  drug  extravasation. Hospitalizations  for therapy  administration, 
hyperglycemia or lymphopenia  related  to dexamethasone and self- limited  fever,  vomiting,  or 
headache will  not be considered serious adverse events  (SAE)  and will not be reported  to the 
IRB or FDA  though they will be captured  in the institutional database. However, life-threatening  
infections  or other  life-threatening  side effects  will be considered SAE's  and will be promptly 
reported  to the Institutional Review  Board  of MSKCC  and to the FDA.  
11.3 Neurologic changes  during the  study period which  meet  the criteria  for grade   4 
neurotoxicity will be assessed  by study physicians as being unrelated,  possibly or probably 
caused  by the injection.  In the absence of clear  evidence of tumor progression, it may be 
assumed  that new signs  and symptoms  are treatment related.  
11.4 Any deaths  will be reviewed  during the study by the Principal  Investigators prior to 
subsequent  entry  of further patients.  
 
12.0 C riteria for Therapeutic Response/Outcome Assessment 
 
12.1 Adequacy of trial: All patients  who fulfill  the eligibility r equirements, receive two treatment 
injections  of 131I-3F8 and undergo extent  of disease evaluation will have an adequate  trial. 
12.2 The primary  endpoint  is overall  survival  at six months  from  the date of  1st 131I-3F8 
injection.  
12.3 Response  duration is  calculated from  the 1st day of treatment with 131I-3F8. 
12.4 Patients  developing progressive  disease will be considered  a treatment failure  under  this 
protocol.  
12.5 Response  Definitions  
12.5.1 Comp lete Respo  nse (CR)  
Cytologic  and radiographic CR will be evaluated  separately,  since patients  with 
cytologic c learing and clinical  response  may continue  to have  residual  
abnormalities  on MRI  scans.  Patients with a CR must  also have stable or improved 
neurologic  exam.

o Cyto lo gic CR 
Complete  clearing of  all malignant  cells from  lumbar  and ventricular  CSF 
based  on cytospin  preparation  in leukemia/lymphoma  patients  and 
cytology in  solid  tumor  patients. A  cytologic CR must  be documented by 
two negative  cytologies on two consecutive  occasions  at least 4 weeks  
apart  (with  no interval  positive c ytologies). 
 
 
o Rad io grap hic C R 
In patients with evidence of  disease on MRI  scan,  complete clearing of 
MRI scan evidence of disease on 2 consecutive  scans  at least 4 weeks  
apart  will be required.  
 
12.5.2 Stab le Disea se (S D) 
Exists  when  a patient  fails to fulfill  the criteria  for either  complete or partial 
response  or progressive  disease.  
 
12.5.3 Progressive Disease (PD)  
An increase of at least 50%  in the absolute  number  of malignant  cells in the CSF 
OR, in -solid  tumor  patients,  an increase of greater  than 25% in the size of 
measurable lesions on MR scan OR the recurrence of malignant  cells in the CSF 
or new lesions on MR  after a patient  has attained  a complete remission OR 
evidence of clinical  neurologic progression. New  sites of or increasing  evidence of 
leptomeningeal  enhancement  that is not "measurable"  will also be  considered  
evidence of disease progression. 
 
  
 
13.0     C riteria For Removal From Study 
 
13.1 If at any time the patient develops  grade 4 toxicity  (other  than controllable  fever,  vomiting, 
headache)  attributed  to the study drugs, he/she  will be removed from  study and receive no further 
injections.  
 
13.2 If at any time the patient  is found to be ineligible  for the protocol  as designated  in the 
section  on Criteria  for Patient/Subject Eligibility  (i.e., a change in diagnosis), the patient will be 
removed  from  the study.  
 
13.3 If at time disease progression is  observed, the patient  will be removed  from  the study.  
 
13.4 If the patient experiences adverse events,  including unacceptable  toxicity  or exacerbation  of 
underlying  disease associated with drug administration and necessitating  discontinuation of 
treatment,  he/she  will come  off the study. Patents  who are removed  from  the study due to 
adverse events  will be treated  and followed according  to established  medical practice.  All 
pertinent  information  concerning  the outcome  of such treatment will be entered  in the Case  
Report  Form  or the Serious  Event  Report,  as applicable.

13.5 Withdrawal of consent:  The patient‟s desire to withdraw  from  the study may occur  at any 
time.  
 
13.6 Noncompliance:  If at any time  the patient  is non-compliant with therapy,  radiation  safety  
guidelines  or requests  withdrawal  from  the study, he/she  will be removed.  
 
13.7 Pregnancy:  The patient  will be removed from  study if  they are found to  be pregnant.  
 
14.0 Biostatistics  
This is a phase  II study to assess  the clinical  efficacy  of weekly  intrathecal  131I-3F8 for a new  
cohort  of 17 patients with GD2 -expressing central  nervous  system  and leptomeningeal  
neoplasms. A “response” is defined  as a patient  being alive  six months  after their first treatment.  
We will test hypothesis  that the proportion of responses  is 25%  or more  against  a null hypothesis  
that proportion  of responses  is 5% or less, with  a power  of 80%  and an alpha  of 5%. Using  a 
Simon  two-stage optimal design, nine patients will initially  be accrued. If at least one responds, 
then a further  8 patients will be entered  on study. If the total number  of responses  is three or 
more,  the agent  will be declared  active.  Under  this design, the probability of declaring the  agent  
inactive at the end of the first stage (0 / 9 responses)  is 0.63 if the true response  rate is 0.05. This 
probability decreases  to 0.08 if the true response  rate is 0.25, The probability  of declaring the 
agent  active (3 or more  responses  / 17) is 0.05 and  0.8 if the true response  rate is 0.05 or  0.25, 
respectively.  It is expected  that 4-6 patients/yr will be enrolled  and that this study can be 
completed  within 2 -3 years.  
 
 Reject  null hypothesis  if: Reject  alternative  hypothesis  if: 
First stage  - 0 / 9 responses 
Second  stage  ≥3 / 17 responses  ≤2 / 17 responses  
 
The number  of CRs,  PRs, SDs  and PDs  will be reported.  Toxicities  will be reported  by type and 
grade.  
 
Three additional  subgroups  will be added  for patients with:  Medulloblastoma  in CR (36 
evaluable patients), Medulloblastoma  with stable,  but minimal disease  (36 evaluable patients), 
and Retinoblastoma or Melanoma (18 evaluable patients).  For patients with neuroblastoma or 
other  cancers  in the CNS,  18 a dditional evaluable patients  will be added. We have completed the  
statistics  for this agent  overall  which have  shown efficacy  on this phase  II study;  increasing  the 
number  of slots  will allow  for in depth statistical analyses  within  these  subgroups  of patients.

17.2 Serious  Adverse Event  (SAE) Reporting  
An adverse event  is considered  serious if it results  in ANY of the following outcomes: 
• Death  
• A life-threatening  adverse event  
• An adverse event  that results  in inpatient  hospitalization  or prolongation  of existing  
hospitalization 
• A persistent  or significant incapacity  or substantial  disruption of the ability  to conduct  
normal  life functions  
• A congenital  anomaly/birth  defect  
• Important  Medical  Events  (IME)  that may not result  in death, be  life threatening, or  
require  hospitalization may  be considered serious  when, based  upon m edical 
judgment,  they may  jeopardize  the patient or subject  and may require  medical or 
surgical intervention to prevent  one of the outcomes  listed  in this definition

Note : Hospital  admission  for a planned p rocedure/disease treatment is not considered an 
SAE.  
 
SAE reporting  is required  as soon  as the participant signs  consent.   SAE  reporting is 
required  for 30-days after the participant‟s last investigational treatment  or intervention.  
Any events  that occur  after the 30-day period and  that are at least possibly related  to 
protocol  treatment must  be reported.  
 
If an SAE  requires  submission to the IRB office  per IRB SOP RR-408 „Reporting  of 
Serious  Adverse  Events‟, the SAE  report  must  be sent to the IRB within  5 calendar  days 
of the event. The  IRB requires a Clinical  Research  Database (CRDB)  SAE  report  be 
submitted  electronically to the SAE  Office  as follows:  
 
 
Reports  that include  a Grade 5 SAE  should be  sent to sae grade5@  mskcc.org .  All other  
reports  should be  sent to sae msk ind@  mskcc.org . 
 
The report  should contain  the following  information: 
Fields  populated  from  CRDB:  
• Subject‟s initials  
• Medical record  number  
• Disease/histology (if applicable)  
• Protocol  number  and title 
Data needing  to be entered:  
• The date the adverse event  occurred  
• The adverse event  
• The grade  of the event  
• Relationship of  the adverse event  to the treatment (drug, device, or  intervention)  
• If the AE was expected  
• The severity  of the AE 
• The intervention 
• Detailed  text that includes  the following  
o A explanation of how the AE was handled  
o A description of the subject‟s condition 
o Indication if  the subject  remains  on the  study  
• If an amendment will need to be made to the protocol  and/or  consent  form

• If the SAE  is an Unanticipated  Problem  
The PI‟s signature  and the date it was signed are required on the completed  report. 
For IND/IDE  protocols: 
The CRDB SAE  report  should be  completed  as per above  instructions. If appropriate, the 
report  will be forwarded  to the FDA  by the  SAE  staff through the  IND  Office 
 
 
17.2.1 Reporting G uidelines: 
• Patient Consented/registered on the assessment  part only:  NO SAEs  will be reported  
• Patient Consented/registered  on the treatment part:  
All SAEs  will be reported  to the FDA  through the  IND office  with reference  to the IND # BB- 
IND-2299  
SAEs  will be defined as grade  4 and  5 toxicities  excluding:   hospitalizations  for therapy  
administration, hyperglycemia or  lymphopenia related  to dexamethasone  and self-limited  
fever, vomiting, or  headache will not be considered  serious  adverse  events  (SAE) and will 
not be reported  to the IRB or FDA  
 
 
18.1 Informed Consent  Procedures  
Before protocol -specified  procedures  are carried  out, consenting professionals will explain full 
details  of the protocol  and study procedures  as well as the risks involved to participants prior to 
their inclusion in the study. P articipants will also be informed that  they are free to withdraw  from  
the study at any time.  All participants must  sign an IRB/PB- approved  consent  form indicating 
their consent  to participate. This consent  form  meets  the requirements  of the Code  of Federal  
Regulations  and the Institutional Review  Board/Privacy  Board  of this Center.  The consent  form 
will include  the following:  
 
1. The nature  and objectives,  potential risks  and benefits  of the intended study.  
2. The length of study  and the likely  follow -up required. 
3. Alternatives  to the proposed study. (This  will include  available standard  and 
investigational  therapies.  In addition, patients  will be offered  an option of supportive  
care for therapeutic studies.)  
4. The name of the investigator(s)  responsible for the protocol. 
5. The right of the participant to acce pt or refuse study interventions/interactions and to 
withdraw  from  participation at any time.

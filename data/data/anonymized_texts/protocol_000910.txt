4.Purpose of the Research Project :  Briefly summarize the overall intent of the study.  Your target audience is a non -researcher.
Include in your description a statemen t of the objectives and th e potential benefit to the study subjects and/or the advancement of your
field.  Generally  included are literature related to the problem, hypotheses, and discussion of the problem’s importance.  Expand
box as needed.
Acute lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) account for more than 27% of all hospitalizations among US  
children under five years of age, with recurrent LRTIs in children a recognized risk factor for asthma. Within  
rural areas of Montana, Alaska, and t he Navajo Reservation, research has shown that residential biomass  
combustion leads to elevated indoor levels of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) that often exceed current healthbased  
air quality standards. Parallel findings have been observed in several de veloping countries where  
biomass combustion is commonly used for cooking and/or heating. This is concerning, as PM2.5 exposure is  
associated with many adverse health outcomes, including a greater than three -fold increased risk of LRTIs.  
Currently, there is  a global effort to reduce indoor biomass smoke exposures in developing countries through  
the introduction of improved cookstove technology. Similar evidence -based efforts are warranted in rural and  
Native American communities in the US that suffer from el evated rates of childhood LRTI and commonly use  
wood for residential heating. To date, exposure reduction strategies in wood stove homes have been either  
inconsistently effective or include factors that limit widespread dissemination and continued complian ce in rural  
and economically disadvantaged populations. In this project, we propose to test the efficacy of two intervention  
strategies for reducing indoor wood smoke PM2.5 exposures and children’s risk of LRTI in three unique and  
underserved settings: (1)  rural mountain valley communities in western Montana; (2) Navajo Nation  
communities; and (3) Alaska Native Villages. We will conduct a three -arm randomized placebo -controlled postonly  
intervention trial in wood stove homes with children less than five yea rs old. Education on best -burn 
practices and training on the use of simple instruments (i.e., stove thermometers and wood moisture meters)  
will be introduced as one intervention arm (Tx1). This intervention will be evaluated against an indoor air  
filtratio n unit arm (Tx2), as well as a placebo arm (Tx3, sham air filters). The primary outcome will be LRTI  
incidence among children under five years of age. To allow for detection of exposure and outcome differences  
within each of the three regions, a sample of 324 homes, or 108 within each study area will be equally  
assigned to each of the three intervention arms. The overall hypothesis is that a low -cost, educational  
intervention targeting indoor wood smoke PM2.5 exposures will be sustainable, and can reduce ch ildren’s risk  
of LRTI in underserved Native and rural communities.  
This checklist submitted to the University of Montana IRB is specific for the activities in study area 1: rural mountain 
valley communities in western Montana. As indicated below (item #5)  the other two study sites will fall under the 
jurisdication of the respective local IRBs.  
        4.1   What do you plan to do with the results? If not discussed above, include considerations such as whether this is a class project, a 
project to impr ove a program/school system, and/or if the results will be generalized to a larger population, contribute to the general fiel d 
of knowledge, and/or be published/presented in any capacity.  
Results will be generalized to other communities and ho useholds that burn biomass for residential heating. Results of 
this research will be published in peer reviewer journals.

6.Subject Information :
  6.1   Human Subjects (identify , include  age/gender ): 
Eligible subjects will include children less than 5 years  of age that live in a household that utilizes a wood stove as the 
primary heating source in  the study region (i.e., rural Montana). We anticipate an equal number of male and female 
child participants. A total of 108 households from this study area will be  recruited for this study. We assume 
approximately 1.5 children under 5 years old per household (n = 162 total child subject).  
3 6.2   How many subjects will be included in the study ?   162 
6.3   Are minors i ncluded (under age 18 , per Monta na law )?  Yes      No    
 If yes, specify age range : 0 to 5 
6.4   Are members of a  physically, psychologically , or socially vulnerable population  being specifically target ed? 
Yes         No     
If yes, please explain  why the subjects might  be physically, psychologically or socially  vulnerable : 
6.5   Are there other special considerations regarding this population? Yes    No   
If yes, please explain:  
6.6   Do subjects reside in a foreign country?     Yes  Specify country :    No     
If yes, please  fill out and attach Form RA -112, For eign Site Study Appendix 
(http://www.umt.edu/research/complianceinfo/IRB/Docs/foreign.doc ). 
6.7   How are subjects selected or recruited?   Include a bulleted list of inclusion/exclusion criteria.  (Attach copies of all 
flyers, advertisements , etc,. that will be used in the  recruitment process  as these require UM -IRB approval )  
For the western Montana study area, we w ill recruit participants through the local medical center, pediatricians’ 
offices, and the Women, Infants and Children (WIC) programs. In addition, we will communicate directly with 
obstetricians, pediatricians, and WIC community nurses to describe the stu dy, and provide recruitment materials such 
as flyers and post cards to be returned by potentially eligible participants.   
Inclusion criteria:  
-Eligible homes will be any home that uses a wood stove as a primary heating source, and has one or more childr en
under the age of five years. The home must include a parent who is capable and willing to record symptom data for
the enrolled children and wood stove usage data.
Exclusion criteria:  
-None.
6.8   How will subjects be identified  in your personal no tes, work papers , or publications : (may check  more than  one) 
  Identified by name and/or address or other  
(Secure written [e.g., ICF] or verbal permission to identify ; if risk exists, create a confidentiality plan .) 
  Confidentiality Plan  
(Identity of subjects linked to research, but not specific data  [e.g., individuals identified in ICF but not included in 
publications ]; identification key kept separate from data; or, data collected by third party [e.g., Select Survey , 
SurveyMonkey , etc. ] and identifiers not received with data .) 
  Never know participant’s identity  
(An ICF may be unnecessary [ e.g, anonymous surv ey, paper or online ] unless  project is sensitive or involves a 
vulnerable population.)  
 6.9   Describe the means by which the human subject’s personal privacy  is to be protected , and the confidentiality of     
information maintained .  If you are using a C onfidentiality Plan (as checked above) , include in your description a plan for 
the dest ruction of materials that could allow identification of individual subjects  or the justification for preserving 
identifiers .    
All households, and child subjects within household, will be assigned unique identification numbers. For practical 
purposes, the PI or appropriate study personnel will have a linkage file on -site (e.g., a file that identifies the subjects 
and their corresponding numbers) during the data collection days to ensure that the correct subjects are identified. At 
all other ti mes, this linkage file will be under the control of the University of Montana PIs. The linkage file will be 
kept separate from other data materials. When sample collection is completed, this linkage file will be returned to a 
locked file cabinet under the control of Co -PI Noonan. Data will be recorded on data collection sheets that contain 
only the subject’s identification number and no other personal identifiers.  
   
 4  
6.9a   Will subject(s) receive an explanation of the research  – separate from the informed consent form  (if applicable ) – 
before and/or after the project?      Yes (attach copy  and explain when given )    No      
 
7.   Information to be Compiled  
 7.1   Explain where the study will take place (physical location no t geographic ). If permission is  required to conduct the  
 research at the location or to use any of the  facilities, indicate those arrangements and attach copies of written permission :  
The study will take place in the children's homes.  
 
 7.2   Will you be working with infectious materials, ionizing radiation, or hazardous materials?  Please specify.   
N/A 
 
 7.3   Subject matter or kind(s) of information to be compiled from/about subjects :  
The primary health outcome  will be occurrence of LRTI among children, and will be assessed using active 
surveillance within the home. Identification of LRTI episodes will occur through a three step process: (1) parent 
reporting of symptoms; (2) Community Coordinator collection of c onfirmatory and severity data; and (3) physician 
classification of case status based on data collected by the Community Coordinator, and when available, data collected 
from a clinic or hospital.  
 
At the onset of the program in each study area, comprehensiv e health outcomes assessment training of Community 
Coordinators will be provided by Drs. Paul Smith and Curtis Noonan. Community Coordinators will then train parents 
in the identification of symptoms consistent with LRTI (cough, difficulty breathing, fast breathing, noisy breathing, 
nasal discharge, loss of appetite and fever). Parents will be asked to contact their Community Coordinator when such 
symptoms are present in household children <five years (Step 1). Home visits will occur within 48 hours of pare nt 
notification of signs and symptoms of LRTI. At this visit, the Community Coordinator will interview the parent about 
each study participant’s symptoms. The Community Coordinator will then measure temperature, respiratory rate and 
saturated oxygen, and e valuate the child for presence of chest indrawing (retractions), wheeze and cough (Step 2). 
Please note that the Community Coordinators are not diagnosing respiratory illness or providing medical care, and 
parents will be encouraged to seek medical care fo r treatment of their child’s respiratory symptoms, when indicated 
(see also Protection of Human Subjects section). For any study participant experiencing symptoms, the Community 
Coordinator will document the presence of symptoms and date of onset with the parent. During the regular 
communication with the parent and subsequent home visits, the Community Coordinator will continue to track this 
child’s symptoms. The last day of cough and rapid breathing with no recurrence of symptoms during a following 14 
day period will be considered the end date for a given episode. Per approaches used internationally, if symptoms recur 
within a period of less than 14 days, these symptom days will be considered part of the immediately preceding episode 
rather than a separate episode. Days with cough as the only symptom will not be included as days for the given LRTI 
episode. The Community Coordinator will also determine if the child was observed by a health care provider, clinic or 
hospital during this episode. If available, h ealth data from such visits will be collected from the covered entity with the 
corresponding parent -signed HIPPA forms. Data collected from medical records will include health care provider 
diagnosis, ausculatory findings, and laboratory/radiological findi ngs. 
 
The Step 1 strategy may be adversely impacted by lack of follow -up by the parent or communication barriers that may 
vary by community. To address this, the Community Coordinator will engage in active and frequent surveillance of 
homes (Step 2), inter viewing the parent at a minimum of once every two weeks regarding symptoms among study 
participants. This communication will occur via telephone, email, or a home visit depending upon the community 
setting and the preferred method of communication. The Com munity Coordinator will also visit the home at a 
minimum of once per month to measure respiratory rate and saturated oxygen, regardless of whether or not the parent 
has reported child symptoms consistent with LRTI. When indicated the Community Coordinator will collect objective 
measures and prospectively track symptoms according to the Step 1 procedures indicated above.  
 
For primary analysis, the final case determination will be made by pediatric pulmonologist, Paul Smith, D.O (Step 3). 
The primary case def inition will be ba sed on the objective data collected by the Community Coordinator. Children <5 
years will be considered to have LRTI if the Community Coordinator documents cough and a respiratory rate ≥40 
breaths per minute in children <1 year or ≥30 breaths per minute in children 1 to <5 years. The primary determinants 
of LRTI status (i.e., respiratory rate and presence of cough) are easily captured by trained Community Coordinators. 
The respiratory rate thresholds are highly sensitive indicators for presence of LRTI. To i mprove specificity for LRTI, 
Dr. Smith will further distinguish between moderate and severe LRTI (i.e., secondary case status determination) 
   
 5 according to the presence of fever, chest indrawing, wheeze and saturated oxygen readings <90% as documented from 
direct field observation or from clinical records.  
 
Other data collection: We will capture additional data that may be relevant to either risk of LRTI or PM2.5 exposures. 
Individual -level characteristics to be captured from parents will include child’s vacc ination history, occurrence and 
duration of breastfeeding, birth weight, and maternal age. Household -level characteristics will include crowding, 
presence of mold, cleanliness, parent education level, household income, and household tobacco smokers. To 
supplement the reporting of household tobacco use, we will collect household surface dust wipe samples at each 
exposure sampling visit to measure deposited nicotine. Alcohol wipes will be collected from horizontal surface areas 
within the home in areas that a re not frequently cleaned (top of doors, top of cabinets, etc.). Following a revised 
method utilized by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,101 analysis for nicotine will be performed 
from the wipes using Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS) at UM under the direction of Dr. Tony 
Ward. Exposures could also be impacted at the household level by various factors such as the use of power generators 
or the use of materials other than wood in stoves, with some activities specific to the study  sites.  
 
 7.4   Activities the subjects will perform and how the subjects will be used . Describe the instrumentation and procedures to 
 be used and kinds of data or information to be gathered.  Provide enough detail so the IRB will be able to evaluate th e 
 intrusion from the subject’s perspective  (expand box as needed) :  
During assessment of suspected LRTI, t he Community Coordinator will measure  the child's  temperature, respiratory 
rate and saturated oxygen, and evaluate the child for presenc e of chest indrawing (retractions), wheeze and cough . 
This will take approximately 15 minutes for each time these factors are assessed for a given child. These same 
measures will be captured for the child each time the Community Coordinator visits the chil d's home. These visits will 
occur once per month for two six -month winter periods, or a total of 12 visits.  
 
7.5   Is information on any of the following included? (check all that apply) : 
   Sexual behavior       Drug use /abuse  
   Alcohol use/abuse       Illegal conduct  
   Information about the subject that, if it became know n outside the research, could reasonably place the  
             subject  at risk of criminal or civi l liability or be damaging to the subject’s financial standing or  
             employability.  
 
 7.6   Means of obtaining the information (check all that apply ). Attach questionnaire or survey instrument , if used:  
  Field/Laboratory observ ation    In-person interviews/survey   
  Blood /Tissue/Urine/Feces/Semen/Saliva     Telephone interviews/survey  
       Sampling  (IBC Application must be submitted)     On-site survey  
   Medical records (require HIPAA form)     Mail survey   
   Measurement of motions/actions         Online survey  (attach Statement of Confidentiality)  
   Use of standard educationa l tests, etc.            Examine public documents, records, data, etc.  
   Other means (specify) :           Examine private documents, records, data, etc.  
  
 7.7   Will subjects be (check all that appl y):  
    Videotaped     Audio -taped     Photographed     N/A  
    (securing an additional signature is recommended on consent/assent/permission forms ) 
  Explain how above media will be used, who will transcribe, and how/when  destroyed:  
      
 
7.8   Discuss the benefits (does not include payment for participati on) of the research, if any, to the human subje cts and to 
scientific knowledge (if the subjects will not benefit from their participation, so state) : 
Those who participate in this research may help inform health researchers, physicians, and th e regulatory community 
about exposure to smoke from wood stoves and the impact of these exposures on susceptible populations. These 
findings will help identify interventions that will be generalizable to other rural impacted by wood smoke. Information 
collected from exposure assessments will also be made available to subjects at the end of their participation in the 
study. These data could be useful for identifying strategies to mitigate in home exposures to PM and respiratory 
morbidity among children. The study may benefit study participants directly through the collection of objective 
measures of their respiratory health. Although the Community Coordinators will not be diagnosing children or 
providing them with medical care, they will have information on n ormal ranges for respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, 
temperature and retractions and thus can refer children for medical care or make a recommendation for referral. In 
these cases, the participants may benefit from receiving care that they might not other wise have sought.  
   
 6  
7.9   Cite any payment for participation  (payment is not considered a benefit) .  If grant funding is not indicate d in item #2, 
please specify  the source of the funding and in what form it is to be dispersed.  
Households , rather than the child subjects, will be payed for their participation. Each household  participating in the 
project in western Montana will receive $100  per each of two winter  periods, or a total of $200.  
 
7.9a   Outline, in detail , the risks and discomfor ts, if any, to which the human subjects will be exposed (Such deleterious 
effects may be  physical, psychological, professional, financial, legal, spiritual, or cultural.   As a result, one can never 
guarantee that there are no risks – use “minimal.”  S ome research involves violations of  normal expectations, rather than 
risks or discomforts; such violations, if any, should be specified) :  
This study will be conducted in the home of children less than 5 years of age. The household intervention doe s not 
involve any medications or changes to the child’s normal care. The proposed methods for assessing the presence of 
LRTI are non -invasive, including respiratory rate measures and recording of symptoms.  
 
 7.9b   Describ e, in detail , the means  taken t o minimize each such deleterious effect or violation :: 
The Coordinators will be trained by our medical consultant to recognize when a child’s symptoms indicate the need 
for medical referral.  
 
8.   Informed Consent  
An informed consent form (ICF) is usually required , unless subjects remain anonymous or a waiver is otherwise justified 
below.  (Templates and examples of  Informed Consent, Parental Permission, and Child’s Assent Forms are available at  
http://www.umt.edu/research/complianceinfo/irb/forms.aspx ).   
 A signed copy of the consent /assent/permission form must be offered to all subjects , including parents/guardians of 
subjects less than 18 years of age  (minors) . 
 Use o f minors

o All minors from 10 to 18 years of age are required to give written assent  (45 CFR 46.408(a)) .   
o Assent by minor subjects :  All minor  subjects are to be given a clear and complete picture of the research 
they are being asked to engage in, together with its attendant risks and benefits, as their developmental 
status and competence will allow them to understand.  
o Minors  less than 10 years of age and all individuals, regardless of age, with delayed cognitive 
functioning (or with communication skills that make expressive responses unreliable) will be denied 
involvement in any research that does not provide a benefit/risk advantage.

  and	
  what	
  you	
  intend

2. Explain	
  your	
  steps	
  to	
  them	
  beforehand	
  so	
  they	
  are	
  aware.

  training	
  with

  Paul	
  Smith,

  Visit	
  Sheet .	
  
7. Count	
  and	
  observe	
  respiratory	
  rate	
  and	
  effort.	
  	
  It	
  is	
  bes t	
  if	
  the	
  caregiver	
  can	
  hold	
  the	
  child	
  on	
  
their	
  lap	
  with	
  their	
  shirt	
  up.	
  	
  She	
  can	
  distract	
  or	
  comfort	
  them	
  while	
  you	
  observe.	
  Determining	
  
respiratory	
  rate	
  can	
  be	
  easy	
  if	
  the	
  child	
  is	
  distracted	
  by	
  something	
  (like	
  a	
  toy	
  or	
  TV),	
  or	
  if	
  the	
  
child	
  is	
  sleeping.	
  W ith	
  older	
  children,	
  or	
  very	
  attentive	
  ones,	
  it	
  can	
  be	
  harder	
  to	
  observe	
  their	
  
breathing	
  rate	
  without	
  them	
  noticing.	
  If	
  the	
  child	
  knows	
  you	
  are	
  counting	
  their	
  breaths,	
  they	
  
may	
  adjust	
  their	
  breathing	
  rate	
  subconsciously.	
  	
  A	
  good	
  trick	
  is	
  to	
  instead	
  act	
  like 	
  you	
  are	
  taking	
  
their	
  pulse,	
  and	
  while	
  they	
  think	
  you	
  are	
  feeling	
  for	
  their	
  heartbeat	
  at	
  the	
  wrist,	
  you	
  are	
  instead	
  
subtly	
  watching	
  them	
  inhale	
  and	
  exhale.

  incidental	
  illnesses	
  in	
  the	
  subjects	
  enrolled	
  in	
  the	
  
KidsAIR	
  study. 	
  
1. The	
  medical	
  resources	
  of	
  specific	
  areas	
  will	
  be	
  determined	
  by	
  participating	
  investigators	
  prior	
  to	
  collection	
  of	
  any	
  field	
  data	
  and

  to	
  each	
  field	
  worker	
  in	
  
anticipatio n	
  of

  That	
  list	
  will	
  include	
  local	
  Emergency	
  Medical	
  
Services,	
  physicia ns	
  and	
  health

  those	
  persons	
  will	
  be	
  the	
  first

2. Local	
  healthcare	
  providers	
  will	
  be	
  contacted	
  prior	
  to	
  study	
  initiation	
  and	
  made	
  aware	
  of	
  the	
  nature	
  of	
  the	
  study	
  and

  of	
  the	
  fieldworkers. 	
  
3. Educational

  will	
  be 	
  provided	
  to	
  each	
  field

  for	
  
the	
  age	
  groups	
  being	
  studied	
  (World	
  Health	
  Organization

  Signs	
  of	
  illness	
  will	
  
be	
  categorized	
  as	
  life	
  threatening	
  (emergent),	
  urgent ,	
  or	
  recommend ed	
  for	
  scheduled	
  
evalua tion	
  by 	
  a	
  health	
  care	
  provider.	
  	
  Each	
  category	
  of	
  illness	
  will	
  initiate	
  a	
  different	
  level	
  of	
  
response.	
   	
  
a. Emergency	
  calls	
  will	
  be	
  made	
  to	
  the	
  closest	
  available	
  emergency	
  personnel.	
  	
  The	
  field	
  
workers	
  will	
  stay	
  at	
  the	
  home	
  until	
  emergency	
  personnel	
  arrive. 	
  
b. Urgent	
  calls	
  (non -­‐emergency	
  but	
  needing	
  care	
  in	
  less	
  than	
  24	
  hours)	
  will	
  be	
  made	
  to	
  the	
  
primary	
  health	
  care	
  provider	
  identified	
  by	
  the	
  parents.	
  	
  Should	
  the	
  family	
  have	
  no	
  such	
  provider,	
  the	
  closest	
  emergency	
  room	
  and	
  health	
  care	
  provider	
  will	
  be	
  contacted. 	
  
c. For	
  illnesses	
  that	
  do	
  not	
  require	
  emergent	
  or	
  urgent	
  care,	
  the	
  parents	
  will	
  be	
  advised	
  to	
  
conta ct	
  their	
  health	
  care	
  provider.	
   The	
  field	
  data	
  collector	
  will	
  volunteer	
  to	
  help	
  families	
  
make	
  contact	
  with	
  appropriate	
  health

Statistical Analysis  Plan  
Analysis was conducted u sing R version 3.6.2 (The R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Austria). We 
calculated descriptive statistics for continuous variables (n, mean, standard deviation [sd], minimum [min], 
median, maximum [max]) and categorical variables (n, percentage of t otal) across all study households and 
separately for each treatment arm and study area. We averaged indoor concentrations of PM2.5 over the 6 -
day sampling period for each home and for the times during which each child was reported as being at the 
household .  
Primary analyses were conducted within three model frameworks using the lme4 package (Bates et al. 2015): 
1) intent -to-treat (ITT) framework with LRTI outcome (ITT -LRTI), 2) ITT framework with PM2.5 outcome (ITT -
PM2.5), and 3) exposure -response (ER) fra mework with LRTI as the outcome and PM2.5 as the exposure of 
interest. Although LRTI cases were collected as count data, very few children had more than one LRTI, 
resulting in under -dispersed data that violated the assumptions of attempted Poisson and nega tive binomial 
regression models. Thus, the ITT -LRTI framework utilized mixed effects logistic regression models (using the 
glmer function) with presence of LRTI (yes or no) as the outcome and assigned treatment as the exposure of 
interest. The ITT -LRTI mod els included a covariate for person -time at risk to account for the wide variability of 
child-weeks at risk across study participants. The models also included a covariate for child age (<1 year vs. 1 
to 4 years) since randomization occurred within strata of this term. A nested random term (i.e., 
household:cohort:area) was included in the model to account for repeated measures clustered within 
household, cohort, and study area. The ITT -PM2.5 framework used mixed effects linear models (using the lmer 
functio n) with mean 6 -day indoor PM2.5 concentration as the outcome and assigned treatment as the 
exposure of interest. Models were adjusted for child age and included a nested random term of cohort:area 
(there were no repeated measures within household for PM2.5 ). Both ITT models utilized the study’s 
randomization and were not adjusted for potential confounding variables in the primary analyses.  
The ER framework utilized mixed effects logistic regression models (using the glmer function) with presence of 
LRTI (y es or no) as the outcome and mean 6 -day indoor PM2.5 concentration as the exposure of interest. As 
with the ITT -LRTI models, ER models were adjusted for person -time at risk and included a nested random 
term (i.e., household:cohort:area) to account for repe ated measures in the analysis. In addition, since the ER 
models did not utilize the study’s randomization to help control for confounding, covariates were included in the 
model to adjust for potential confounders. Confounders were identified a priori throu gh previous literature and 
by assessing independent associations with the exposure and outcomes of interest (Adaji et al. 2019; Mortimer 
et al. 2017; Noonan et al. 2019; Smith et al. 2011; Walker et al. 2021). We also used directed acyclic graphs 
(DAGs) to  assess the direction and potential relationship between indoor PM2.5, LRTI, and covariates (Figure 
S3). Final ER models were adjusted for child age and sex, caregiver race and sex, household income, 
caregiver education, if a household resident smoked, and  ambient temperature and PM2.5.  
The primary ITT model framework was prespecified in our previously published methods paper (Noonan et al. 
2019). We conducted a number of sensitivity analyses in all model frameworks that were specified a priori 
(during the  initial model development when the analyst was masked to treatment arm assignment) and 
assessed the impact of including potential confounders in the models and using subsets of the data. We 
conducted sensitivity analyses by including potential confounders  that had some imbalance across study arms 
(ITT frameworks) or by including additional potential confounders not included in the primary model (ER 
framework). Due to the different control treatment in AK (no filtration unit), we conducted the ITT -LRTI and ITT-
PM2.5 analyses with AK households excluded from the dataset. For the ITT -LRTI and ER frameworks, we also 
conducted a sensitivity analysis with a dataset restricted to Winter 1 only, as this was the only winter of 
observation when indoor PM2.5 was sampl ed. For the ER framework we conducted an additional sensitivity 
analysis that used indoor PM2.5 when each child was at home as the primary exposure variable in place of 
indoor PM2.5 over the entire sampling period.  
We also conducted some post hoc sensitiv ity analyses for the ITT -LRTI framework with other model variations 
to provide insight into our primary model selection and results. Specifically, we assessed models that 1) used 
study area (AK, NN, WMT) as a fixed effect rather than a random nested term, 2) removed the covariate for 
person -time at risk, and 3) removed the random nested term for household.  
We evaluated potential modification of the effect of the treatments by a priori selected child, caregiver, and 
home characteristics within each of the m odel frameworks by including interaction terms in the primary model. 
We assessed significance of the interaction terms using Type II Wald Chi -square tests. Model assumptions 
were evaluated in all analysis frameworks. Indoor PM2.5 concentrations were natura l-log transformed in the 
ITT-PM2.5 framework, and estimates are presented as percent difference in geometric mean PM2.5.

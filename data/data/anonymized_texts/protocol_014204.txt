2.1. MECHANISM OF ACTION  
Cassava Sciences , Inc. is developing simufilam , a novel drug candidate designed t o treat 
and slow the progression of Alzheime r’s disease (AD). Simufilam binds with femtomolar 
affinity to an altered con formation of fil amin A (F LNA)  that is induced by beta amyloid 1-
42 (Aβ42), present  in AD brain and critical to the toxicity of A β42.1-3 Simufilam  binding 
reverses th e altered FLNA conformation and restores FLNA’s native shape, preventing 
two t oxic signaling cascades of A β42. Aβ42, in monomer or s mall oligomer form,  hijack s 
the α7-nicotinic acetylchol ine receptor ( α7nAChR) and signal s via this rec eptor to 
hyperphosphorylate tau. This signaling requires the recruitment of altered FLNA to this  
receptor . Second, altered FLNA also links to  toll-like re ceptor 4 (TLR4) to allow A β42 to 
persisten tly activ ate this receptor. Normal FLNA does not associate w ith either 
α7nAChR or TLR4. In addition to disrupting the normal functions of α7nAChR and tau 
protein, Aβ42’s toxic signaling to hyperphosphorylate tau le ads to the signature tangles 
and plaques in AD brain. In two AD mouse  models and in postmortem human AD brain 
tissue, simufilam restored function of three receptors that are impai red in AD: the 
α7nAChR , the N -methyl -D-aspartate receptor ( NMDAR ), and the in sulin receptor (IR).2,3 
Simufilam  also improved synaptic plasticity  and reduced tau hyperphosphorylation, 
amyloid deposits, neurofibrillary tangles and inflamma tory cytokine release.2,3 We 
therefore expect simufilam both to improve cognition and to slow AD progression. Both 
mouse models used a dose of  20 mg/kg/day (e quivalent to 60 mg/m2/day) .  
2.2. SAFETY PHARMACOLOGY AND TO XICOLOGY  
A robust nonclinical A DME, safety pharmacology, and general and genetic toxicology 
program has been conducted  with simufilam. In vitro metabolic profiling showed 
minimal metabolis m across  several species including human s. Simufilam was rapid ly 
absorbed and eliminated in in vivo studies in rat and dog with nearly 100% oral 
bioavailability, a 2.67- h half -life in dog, dose -proportional PK and no accumulation. 
Safety pharmacology studi es showed no adverse effects on gro ss behavioral and 
physiological p arameters in the Irwin test of CNS toxicity in rats, no adverse effects on 
respiratory rate, tidal volume or minute volume in the rat respiratory test, and no adverse 
effects on arterial b lood press ure, heart rate and ECG p arameters in the dog 
cardio vascul ar study. The in vitro hERG tes t for cardiotoxicity also indicated no adverse 
effect. A full battery of genot oxicity studies was conducted (in vitro bacterial Ames, in 
vitro chromosomal aberration, and in vivo rat micronucl eus test) and were all negative. 
An in vitro specificity screen showed no significant activation or inhibition of a panel of 
68 receptors, channels and transporters.

Simufilam, a  small molecule t o treat  AD March 5 , 2021  
Page 9 of 30     CONFIDENTIAL  Simufilam was tested  in repeat dose oral toxicity stu dies in rats and dogs . A 6-month 
repeat dose or al toxicity study in rat (PTI-125-NC-049) used the same doses as a  28-day 
study (50, 500 and 1000 mg/kg/day) , which found 500 mg/kg/day to be the no observable 
adverse effect level ( NOAEL ). In the 6 -month study, t he toxicological  response was 
characterized  by decreased body we ights and advers e structural and functional alterations 
in the liver of 500 and 1000 mg/kg ani mals, including increased weight, hepatocellular 
hypertrophy and vacuolation, single/multiple basophilic/  eosinophilic/clear cell focus, 
hepa tocellular degenerati on, pigmentation, and oval cell hyperplasia. The presence of bile 
pigment was consistent with cholestasis. These findings correlated with changes to the 
clinical chemistry profile, including increased ALP and  total/direct bilirubin. Ov er the 1 -
month recove ry period, there  was complete recovery of the hepatocellular degeneration 
and partial recovery  of hepatocellular  hypertrophy. The NOAEL from this 6 -month study 
was 50 mg/kg/day (equivalent  to 300 mg/ m2). A second 6-month repeat  dose oral toxicity 
study in rat , pending pathology, will more accurately determine the  6-month NOAEL  in 
rat. Doses are vehicle and 125 and 250 mg/kg/day.  
In a 9-month toxicity study in dog (PTI-125-NC-050), the no observable ef fect level 
(NOEL)  of simufilam was 25 mg/kg. Th e 200 mg/kg (high) dose was decreased  to 150 at 
1 month due to bodyweig ht loss thought unsus tainable for 9 months . Clinical signs were 
saliv ation and a few instances of m uscle fasciculations . There were no pat hology 
findings , but the high dose  was consider ed adverse d ue to two  unexplained deaths. The 
75 mg/kg/day NOAEL provid es 38- and 19- fold safety mar gins by Cmax and AUC , 
respectively,  over  the 100 mg b.i.d. dose in pa tients.  
2.3. CLINICAL STUDIES  
A first-in-huma n, double -blind, Single Ascending Dos e clinical tria l was conducted in 
healthy normal volunteers , age  18-45 with oral dosing solution. Doses were placebo, 50, 
100 and 200 mg (equivalent to 31, 62, and 123 mg/m2, respectively)  adminis tered to th ree 
differen t groups of volu nteers . The study showed dose proportional PK, and t here were 
no drug- related adverse  events  (AEs). 
In a Phase 2 a 28-day study, 13 mild-to-moderat e AD patients  receiv ed simufilam 100 mg 
b.i.d. as oral tablets. Patient s were MMSE  ≥ 16 and ≤ 24, age 50 -85, with a CSF t otal 
tau/Aβ 42 ratio ≥ 0.30. A second CSF sam ple was collected on Day 28 , allo wing 
assessment of change from baseline in biomarkers  using commercial  ELISA kits.  All 8 
bioma rkers that are elevated in AD were sig nifica ntly reduced  from baseline (Fig. 1).4 
Aβ42, which is low in AD, was increased slightly  but non- significantly. Reduced 
inflammatory cytokines and YKL -40 indicated reduced neuroinfla mmation . A reduced 
neurodegenerative drive was sugg ested by reductions in neurogranin, neurofilament light 
chain, a nd total tau. T he robust reduction in phospho- tau ( P-Tau181) confirms  the 
mechanism of action of simufilam. Simufilam was safe and well toler ated in all  patients.

Pharmacokinetic analy sis indicated minimal accum ulation (ratio 1.36, based on ove rall

Steady stat e concentration  was achi eved by Day 7 and were maintained through Day 28.  
A Phase 2b  randomized  clinical trial of simufilam 50 or 100 mg tablets  or placebo (1:1:1)  
enrolled 64 mild -to-moderate AD patients . Both doses significantly improved el even CSF  
biomark ers of AD path ology, neurodegeneration, neuroinflammation  and blood- brain 
barrier  integr ity (Fig. 2). CSF b iomarker analyses  were condu cted blind to treatment and 
timepoint by an outside lab. These data s uggest disease modificati on and replicate the 
Phase 2a results  in a well -controlled study.

Page 11 of 30     CONFIDENTIAL  The secondary endpoints in the Phase 2b trial were two cognitive measures using the 
Cambridge Neu ropsycho logical Test Automated Battery.  Patients were assessed  on the 
Paired Associate Learn ing (PAL) test , measuring  episodic memory, and a test of spatial 
working memory. The primary outcome measures  for each were total errors, with errors 
imputed for m ore difficult levels not reached in the PAL test. Simufilam produced 
encouraging effect sizes ( calculated  by He dge’s g for group sizes of 20) , suggestin g 
cognitive enhancement  (Fig. 3). Effect sizes versu s placebo for the test of episodic 
memory w ere 37% a nd 23% fo r the 50 and 100 mg groups , respectively, after removing 
the mo st and least impaired subjects by baseline score. For sp atial working memory, 
effect  sizes were 17% and 4 6% for these respective dose groups. Cognit ive enhan cement 
by simufilam is supported by preclinical d ata showing improved  function of α7nAChR , 
NMDAR  and insulin receptors  and improv ed synaptic plasticity in 3xTg AD  mice  and in 
postmort em human AD brain  tissue . In both Phase 2 clinical trials, simufilam was well  
tolera ted and no patients disco ntinued due t o AEs.

To benefit participants of previous  one-month studies  and to assess longer -term clinical 
safety of simufilam, a 1-year, open-label clin ical trial of  approximately 100 mild-to-
moderate AD patients  is ongoing. All prior patients were eligible , and n ew patients 
(MMSE 1 6-26) can enrol l. All new patients have a baseline C SF draw , and change in  
biom arkers w ill be evaluated after  6 or 12 m onths . Additionally, cognition is being 
assessed with the  ADAS -Cog and  neuropsychiatric symptoms  by the NPI .

The objectives of t his study are 1)  to assess th e effect of food on the rate and extent of 
absorption of simufilam , and 2) to compare t he pharmacokinet ic profile of the Phase 3  
formu lation of simufilam to that of the earlier Phase 2 formulation . The new Phase 3 
formulation has a higher percentage of active ingredient and is therefore  smaller with a 
slightly different shape.  
4. SUMMARY OF STUDY DESIGN  
This i s a si ngle-center, randomized, four -treatment, four-sequence crossover  study in 
healt hy volunteers  to estimate the effect of f ood on the PK  of simufilam followi ng oral 
dosing of the Phase 3  simufilam 100 mg tablet . Additionally , the relative  bioavaila bility  
of the Pha se 3 tablet will be compared to the earlier Phase 2 simufilam 100 mg tablet , 
both in the fasted st ate. A total of  twenty  four (24) healthy volunteers  (12 male and 12 
female) wil l be enrolled in to this stu dy. Subjects  will be ran domly assigned to one of fou r

release . 
8. ADVERSE  EVE NTS/SERIOUS ADVERSE  EVENTS   
8.1. ADVERSE  EVENTS - DEFINIT ION 
An adverse event  (AE)  is any undesirable  event that occurs  to a subject  durin g a 
study, whether  or not that event  is considered study drug- related . Moni toring for A Es 
will start at dos ing. Examples  include:  
• Any treatment -emergent  signs  and symptoms  (events that are marked  by a 
change  from  the subjec t's baseline/entry  status  [e.g., an increase  in severity  or 
frequen cy of pre-existing abnormality  or disorde r]) 
• All reactio ns from  study drug, an overdose, abuse of drug, withdrawal  
phenomena , sensitivity  or toxicity  to study drug 
• Apparently unrelated  illnesses 
• Injury or accidents  (Note: if a medical  condition is known to have caused the 
injury or accident , the medical  condition and the accident  should be reported  as 
two separate medical event s [e.g., for a fall secondary  to dizziness,  both 
"dizziness"  and "fall" should be recorded  sepa rately])  
• Extensions  or exacerb ations  of symptom s, subjective subject -reported  events,  
new clinically  significa nt abnormalities  in clinic al laboratory, physiologi cal 
testing or physical  examination  
 
All AEs,  whether  or not related  to the study drug, must  be fully and completely  
document ed on the AE page of the CRF  and in the subject's  clinical  chart. 
In the event that a subject  is withdrawn  from  the study because  of an AE, it must  be 
recorded  on the CRF  as such. The subject  should be followed and treated  by the 
Investigato r until the abnormal  parameter  or symptom  has resolved  or stabi lized.  
The Investigator  must report all directly  observed  AEs and all spontaneousl y 
reported AEs.  The Investigator  will ask the subject  a non-specific  question (e.g., 
"Have  you noticed anything different since your dose of the study medicat ion?")  to 
assess whether  any AEs have  been  experi enced  since the last assessment.  AEs will 
be identified and documen ted on the AE CRF  in appropri ate medical  terminolog y. 
The severity  and the relationship to the study drug will be determined  and reported  
on the CRF  (see below).  
Cassava Sciences , Inc. Clinical Pro tocol PTI -125-05 
Simufilam, a  small molecule t o treat  AD March 5 , 2021  
Page 22 of 30     CONFIDENTIAL  8.2. ADVERS E EVENTS - SEVERITY RATIN G 
The severity  of each AE should be character ized and then classified  into one of three  
clearly defined  categories  as follows:  
• Mild  - the AE does not interf ere in a signif icant  manner with the subject's  
normal functioni ng level.  It may be an annoyance.  
• Moder ate - the AE produc es some  impairment  of functio ning but is not 
hazardous  to health.  It is uncomfortable  or an embarrassment.  
• Severe - the AE produces  significant impair ment  of function ing or 
incapacit ation  and is a definite  hazard  to the subject's healt h. 
These three catego ries are based on the Investigator's clinical  judgment, which in turn 
depends  on consideratio n of various  factors  such as the subject's  report, and the 
physici an's observations. The severity  of the AE should be recorded  in the 
appropriate section  of the Adverse  Event  CRF. 
8.3. ADVERS E  EVENTS  -  RELATIONSHIP  TO  STUD Y   DRUG 
The relationship  of each AE to the study drug will be classified  into one of three  
defined  categori es as follows:  
• Unlikely  - a causal relations hip between  the AE and the study  drug is unlik ely. 
• Possible  - a causal  relationship  betw een the AE and the study  drug is possible.  
• Probable  - a causal  relationship between the AE and the study drug is proba ble. 
For example,  the AE is a common adverse  event  know n to occur with the 
pharmacological  class  the study drug belongs  to; or the AE abated on study  
drug discontinua tion and reappeared  upon rechallenge with the study drug. 
These three categories  are based on the Investigator's  clinical  judgme nt, which  in turn 
depends  on consideration of various  factors such as the subject' s report, the timing of 
the AE in relationship  to study drug administration/discontinuation, the phys ician's  
obser vations and the physi cian's prior exper ience. The relationsh ip of the AE to the 
study drug will be recorded  in the appropriate  section of the Adverse Event  CRF.  
8.4. SERIOUS ADVERS E EVENTS AND UNEXPECTED ADVERSE EVENTS - DEFINITIONS  
A Serious Adv erse Event (SA E) includes  (but is not limite d to) an exper ience  
occurring at any dose that results  in any of the following outcomes:  
• Death  
• A life-threatenin g even t (i.e., the subject  is at immediate  risk of death  from  the 
reaction  as it occurs).  "Life -threatening"  does not include  an event  that, had it 
occurred  in a more  serious  form,  might have caused  death. For example,  drug-  
Cassava Sciences , Inc. Clinical Pro tocol PTI -125-05 
Simufilam, a  small molecule t o treat  AD March 5 , 2021  
Page 23 of 30     CONFIDENTIAL  induced hepatitis  that resolved without evidence  of hepatic failure would  not be 
considered  life-threatening  even  though drug- induced hepatitis  can be fatal.  
• In-patie nt hospital ization  (hospital admission, not an emerg ency room  visit) or 
prolo ngation of  existing  hospitalizatio n. 
• A persi stent or significan t disability/in capacity  (i.e., a substantial  disruption  of 
the subject's  ability  to carry  out norma l life functions) . 
• A congenital anomaly/ birth  defect . 
 
In addition, medical and scientific  judgment should be exercised  in decid ing whethe r 
other situations  should be consi dered  an SAE  (i.e., important  medical  events  that may 
not be immed iately  life-threatening or result  in death  but may jeopard ize the subject  
or may requir e medical  or surgical  intervention to prevent  one of the other outcom es 
listed in the definition  above) . Examples  of such medical  events  include  (but are not 
limited  to): allergic  bronchospasm  requiring intensiv e treatment  in an emergency  
room  or at home, blood dyscras ias or convul sions  that do not result in in-patient 
hospitaliz ation, or the development  of drug depende ncy or drug abuse.  
An unexpected  AE is one for which the specifi city or severit y is not consist ent with 
the current Investigato r's Brochure.  For example,  hepatic necrosis  would be 
unexpe cted (by virtue of greater severity) if the Investigator' s Brochure  only listed  
elevated  hepa tic enzymes  or hepatitis.  
Similarly, cerebra l thromboembolism and  cerebr al vasculitis  would be unexpecte d 
(by virtue  of greater  specificity)  if the Investigator's  Brochure  only listed  cerebral 
vascular  accidents. 
8.5. SERIOUS  ADVERSE EVENT S REPORTING  
The report ing of SAEs  by the Sponsor  to Regulatory Authorities (e.g., FDA)  is a 
regulatory require ment.  Each  Regu latory  Agency has establish ed a timetab le for 
reporting SAEs  based  upon  establishe d criteria.  Likewis e, it is the responsibility  
of the Principal  Invest igator  to report  SAEs to  their EC/IRB.  
 
All SAEs must be reported  immediat ely (within  24 h of learning  of the event)  by 
telephone  to: 
Nadav Fr iedmann, PhD, MD  
Cass ava Sciences, Inc. 
Email:  nfriedmann@cas savasciences.co m  
Phone:     925- 788-4585  
Do not delay  reporting  a suspect ed SAE to obtain additional information.  Any 
addit ional  informa tion, if collected,  can be reported  to the Sponsor  as a follow-up to 
the initial report.  
Cassava Sciences , Inc. Clinical Pro tocol PTI -125-05 
Simufilam, a  small molecule t o treat  AD March 5 , 2021  
Page 24 of 30     CONFIDENTIAL  A com pleted  SAE  report  form  must be faxed  within  five working days  to the medical  
monitor. SAEs  must  also be repo rted to the respon sible EC/IRB imme diatel y. 
In the case of a death  or other  SAE  that has occurred  within  30 days after receiving  
study drug, the Principal  Investigator  must  also report  such an event  within 24 hours  
of being notified. Your  local  EC/IRB may  also requir e these re ports.  
In the event of any SAE (other than death),  the subject  will be instructed  to contact 
the study physician (Principal  Investigator  or designee)  using the phone  numbe r 
provi ded in the Informed  Consent  Form.  All patients  exper ienci ng an SAE  will be 
seen by a Princ ipal Investig ator or designee  as soon as feasi ble followi ng the report  
of an SAE . 
9. STATIS TICAL  CONSIDERATIONS  
9.1. RANDOM IZATION  
Randomized treat ments will be assign ed by patient numbers in a randomly generated 
numeric seque nce. 
9.2. ANALYSIS POPULATIONS  
All subjects  who receive one dose of study medication will  be include d in the safety 
analyses . Any subject who did not complete all 4 study periods will be excluded from 
the PK a nalysis . The PK samples from  subjects who drop out early  will be an alyzed 
and reported in the data list ings.   
9.3. PHAR MACOK INET IC ANALYSI S 
Pharmacokinetic Methods  
Plasm a concentration -time data will be  analyzed using noncompa rtmenta l methods i n 
Phoenix™ WinNonlin® (Version  8.1, Certara, L.P.) in conjuncti on with the internet -
access ible implementation of Pharsight® Knowled gebase ServerTM (PKSO;  Version 
4.0.4, Certara, L.P .). Concentration- time data that are  below the limit of q uantifi cation 
(BLQ) will be  treated as zero  in the data summarization and descrip tive sta tistics.   
In the pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis,  BLQ con centrations will be  treated as zero from 
time-zero up to the time at which  the first quantifiable concentration  will b e observed; 
embedded  and/or  terminal BLQ con centrations will be  treated as  “missin g.” Actual 
sample times  relative to the time of dose  will be used in the  PK analysis . 
The following PK paramet ers will be  calculated  (but may not be limited to ): 
Cmax The max imum concentration determined dir ectly from individual 
concentration -time data 
Cassava Sciences , Inc. Clinical Pro tocol PTI -125-05 
Simufilam, a  small molecule t o treat  AD March 5 , 2021  
Page 25 of 30     CONFIDENTIAL  Tmax Time to reach m aximum conce ntration  
AUC last Area und er the curve to the time of the last quantifiable 
conc entration, calculat ed using the linear trapezoidal method  
AUC inf Area under the curve extr apolat ed to infinity; calculated as:  
AUC inf = AUC last + C last/λz 
Clast The last quantifiable concentration determined directly from 
individual concentration -time da ta 
Tlast Time of the last quantifiable concentration 
λz The observed elimination rate con stant; estimated by linear 
regression through a t least three d ata points in the terminal phase 
of the log concentration -time profile  
T1/2 The observed terminal elim ination half -life c alculated as:  
zTλ)2ln(
2/1=  
 Note:  λz and parameters calculat ing us ing λ z (AUC inf and T 1/2) will be reported  only if 
an app arent elimination phase is observed.  
Statistical Procedures  
Natural log transformed  AUC inf (if data permit) , AUC last, and Cmax, will be  analyzed 
using a mixed  effect  model with sequence,  period, and treatment a s fixed effects and 
subject wi thin sequence a s a random effect.  Estimates of the adjusted  mean differences  
(Test -Reference) and corresponding 90% confidence intervals  (CIs) will be  obtained 
from the model.  The adjusted mean differences an d 90% CIs  for the  differences will be  
exponenti ated to provide  estimates  of the ratio of adjusted  geometric  means  
(Test/R eference) and  90%  CIs for the ratios.  
For th e food effect asses sment, simufilam in the fasted  state will be  the intended 
reference  treatment. The follow ing comparisons will be made:  
High -fat vs. Fa sted 
Low-fat vs. Fasted.  
Phase 2 tab let formulation vs. curr ent tablet formulation (both F asted).  
9.4. SAFET Y ANALYSIS  
Adverse  events  reported  on case report forms  will be mapped  to preferred  terms  and 
organ systems using the MedDRA  mapping syste m. For each pre ferred term event, 
frequency counts  and percentages will be calculated by treatment per iod. Vital signs  
and clinical laboratory results  will be descriptively summarized  in terms of change 
from s creening values.

11.1. CASE  REPORT  FORMS  
Case rep ort forms (CRF s) will be pro vided for each subject. The subjects i n the study 
will not be  identified by  name on any study documents to be collected by the Sponsor 
(or C RO designee),  but will be  ident ified by a Study Identification Number and initials.   
All clinical info rmation req uested in this protocol will be recorded on the CRFs 
provided by the Sponsor using legible entries with a black ballpoint pen. If an error is 
made, a single line will b e draw n thr ough the error and the correct respon se will be 
written adjacent t o the error , and initialed and dated.  
CRFs must be r eviewed and verified fo r accuracy by the Principal Investigator and 
signed- off before collectio n by the Sponsor (or CRO designe e). A copy of the CRF will 
remain at  the Investi gator's site at  the completio n of the . 
11.2. AVAILABILITY AND RETENTION OF INVESTIGATIO NAL RECORDS  
The Inve stigator must mak e study data accessible to the monitor, other authorized 
represen tatives  of the Sponsor (or  designee)  and Regulatory Agency (e .g., FDA) 
inspectors upon r equest. To  assure accuracy o f data collected in the CRFs, it is 
mandatory that Sponsor  representatives have access to original source documents (e.g., 
subject records, subject charts, and labor atory repor ts). During review of the se 
documents , the subject's  anonymity wil l be mainta ined with adherence to  professional 
stand ards of confidential ity and applicabl e laws. A file for each subject must be  to that 
subject. T he Inve stigator must ensure the r eliab ility and availability of sour ce 
documents  from which the  information on the CRF w as derived.  Investigators are

The Investigator is responsible f or ma intaining adequate case histor ies in each subject's 
sourc e records. The  Sponsor re serves the right to terminate the study f or the 
Investigator's r efusal to  supply source documentation of work performed in this clinical  
trial.  
11.3. SUBJECT CONFIDENTIALITY  
All r eport s and subject samples wil l be identif ied only by Study Identification Number 
and initials to maintain subject confiden tiality. Additional sub ject confident iality is sues

Clinic Director at University of Pennsylvania changed from John Kempen, MD, PhD to Nirali 
Bhatt, MD  
 
1.8 Rationale for trial  
Changed “uveitic macular edema persistent after intravitreal triamcinolone injection ” to “uveitic 
macular edema persisting after an intravitreal corticosteroid injection ”  
 2.2 Hypotheses  
Changed “ uveitic macular edema persistent after intravitreal triamcinolone injection ” to “uveitic 
macular edema persisting after an intravitreal corticosteroid injection ”  
 3.3 Trial schema  
Added intravitreal methotrexate at week 4 (M02) as needed; previously additional injection only 
was permitted at week 8 (M03) as needed  (per recommendation of DSMC)  
 3.6   Eligibility  
Inclusion criterion #3 (e ye level) was revised  to allow macular edema persisting after intravitreal 
corticosteroid injection  (which includes intravitreal dexamethasone) rather than limiting to 
macular edema persisting after intravitreal triamcinolone  as follows :  Macular edema (ME) 
defined as the presence of macular thickness greater than the normal range for the OCT 
machine being used , regardless of the presence of cysts, following an intravitreal cortic osteroid 
injection ( ≥ 28 days following intravitreal triamcinolone injection and ≥ 90 days following 
intravitreal dexamethasone implant injection)  
 
Inclusion criterion #6 (eye level):  At request of DSMC, italicized text was added to clarify that eye being treated with combination therapy is equivalent to  use of two IOP -lowering 
medica tions as follows:  Baseline intraocular pressure > 5 mm Hg and ≤ 21 mm Hg (current use 
≤2 intraocular pressure -lowering medications and/or prior glaucoma surgery are acceptable  — 
note that an eye being treated with a combination therapy like Combigan is counted as being

P:\Doc\MUST \MERIT \protocol \1.8_20 08 20\ MERIT protocol 1.8_20 Aug 2020.docx  treated with two IOP -lowering medications, which means, for example, that an eye treated with 
Combigan and a prostaglandin analogue is not eligible for the trial ;  
 
Exclusion criterion #9 (eye level):   As recommended by the DSMC, changed “uncontrolled” to 
“severe” glaucoma as follows:   History of severe glaucoma as defined by optic nerve damage 
(cup/disc ratio of  ≥ 0.9 or any notching of optic nerve to the rim) ; 
 
4.1.1 Schedule  of assigned treatment  and 4.1.2 Additional  injections  
For intravitreal  methotrexate added that additional injections are permitted as needed at weeks 4 and 
8; previously additional injection as needed at week 8 only  
4.2.3    Intravitreal methotrexate injection preparation and administration  
Removed information and reference describing the use of frozen methotrexate preparations as 
requested by CC’s IRB as reference from 1988 is out of date.    
 
4.2.4    Intravitreal ranibizumab formulation, storage, and administration  
Added:  Preparation of injection as requested by CC’s IRB 
• Using aseptic technique,  remove contents from the vial using a 5 micron, 19 gauge  filter 
needle attached to a 1 -cc tuberculin syringe. Remove filter needle and replace with the 
provided 30 gauge ½ inch needle for injection.  
 
5.1 Safety  reporting of adverse events – General overview  
This section was revised to reflect timeframe for DSMC Medical Safety Officer’s review of SAE report s as 
agreed upon at 8 Dec 2015 DSMC meeting.  Any SAE reports of a subject death will be sent to DSMC  
Medical Safety Officer within 24 hours of receipt at the CC.  Non -death SAE reports will be sent to the 
DSM C Medical Safety Officer within 7 days of receipt at the CC.  The DSMC Medical Safety Officer will 
review each report to determine what, if any , additional actions are needed, including whether the 
other DSMC members need to be informed of the event immediately as opposed to waiting for the next 
DSMC meeting or conference call.  
 
7.2 IRB /Protection of human subjects  
Data and safety monitoring  
• Corrected description of  new member from “statistician” to  “ experienced methodologist 
for ophthalmic studies ” 
• Clarified that DSMC will meet at least twice a year, one of these meetings being in person and one by conference call and that additional meetings may be arranged at the request of

 4.2. Study treatment schedule and re -treatment cr iteria and subsections  
• Added note for all study treatments:  IOP requirements for the initial injection are the same as 
for eye eligibility for the trial. If study treatment is initiated on the same day as eligibility is confirmed and treatment assigned, no  additional IOP measurements are needed.  If 
circumstances require patient to return to clinic for injection at a later date, IOP must be checked and IOP -lowering agents evaluated prior to injection. If the eligibility requirements are not met, 
the injection should not be given. If the treating ophthalmologist elects to proceed with assigned treatment per best medical judgment, the deviation from the protocol must be reported to CC on an Unanticipated Event (UA) form; the UA form should be submitted as soon as possible.  
• General formatting of subsections modified and information repeated for completeness and 
clarification within section, e.g., in sections 4.2.2 (intravitreal methotrexate) and 4.2.3 
(intravitreal ranibizumab) a bullet “For women of child -bearing potential, negative pregnancy 
test required before all injections” was added even though this information was already included in the overview section and elsewhere in protocol . 
 
5.1.2  Pre-injection IOP requirements  
Added distinction between IOP requirement before in itial injection ≤21 mm Hg vs. before 
retreatment injections ≤25 mm Hg  (Although IOP for study eligibility has always been  ≤21 mm Hg 
Hg with 3 or fewer IOP -lowering agents, this revision of the protocol explicitly states that  IOP 
criteria ≤21 mm Hg with 3 or fewer IOP -lowering agents need to be met before the initial study 
treatment  (as in cases when the initial study treatment is not administered on the day of enrollment but on a later date.)  
  5.4 Intravitreal methotrexate preparation and administration  
5.4.1  Preparation of [intravitreal methotrexate] injection by research pharmacy

If research pharmacy’s existing label/practice is to fill syringe with alternative amount, 
e.g., 0.4 mL, this practice is acceptable as it will not affect the volume (0.1 mL) or dose

 Abstract  
Added recurrent  as italicized below  
The Macular Edema Ranibizumab v. Intravitreal anti- inflammatory Therapy (MERIT) Trial will 
compare the relative efficacy and safety of intravitreal methotrexate, ranibizumab, and 
dexam ethasone implant for persistent or recurren t macular edema.  
 
1.8  Rationale for trial  
Added recurrent macular edema to rationale for trial as indicated in italics below  
The goal of the MERIT Trial is to compare the relative effectiveness of a repeat cortico steroid 
injection for persistent or recurrent macular edema in eyes with controlled inflammation (the current standard approach), versus each of the alternative non -corticosteroid modalities 
(intravitreal ranibizumab or intravitreal methotrexate) for the t reatment of uveitic macular 
edema that is persistent or recurrs after an intravitreal corticosteroid injection.  
 
2. 1 Objective  
Added recurrent as italicized below  
 The MERIT Trial was designed to find out which intravitreal therapy offers the best balanc e of 
effectiveness and tolerability in treating persistent or recurrent uveitic macular edema in eyes 
with controlled uveitis, specifically by comparing the relative efficacy and safety of intravitreal 
ranibizumab (Lucentis®) and intravitreal methotrexate to intravitreal dexamethasone implant (Ozurdex®) f or the treatment of persistent or recurrent uveitic macular edema.

Added recurring as italicized below  
(1) Intravitreal injections of methotrexate will have greater efficacy than intravitreal 
injections of the dexamethasone pellet as a treatment for u veitic macular edema 
persisting or recurring  after treatment with an intravitreal corticosteroid injection.  
  
(2) Intravitreal injections of ranibizumab will have greater efficacy than intravitreal injections of the dexamethasone pellet as a treatment for uveitic macular edema 
persisting  or recurring  after treatment with an intravitreal corticosteroid injection . 
 3.3  Trial schema  
Revised retreatment  criteria 
From    
Eye does not meet ME improvement defi nition (20% decrease in central subfield thickness of 
the macula or normalization of macular thickness e ven if there is <20% reduction)  OR ME 
worsens at the specified time point OR eye has achieved normal central subfield thickness but with cystoid spaces in the 1 mm central subfield  
To  
Central subfield thickness greater than 1.1X upper limit of normal (330 µm for Zeiss and Topcon 
SD OCT and 352 µ m for Heidelberg OCT) and/or cystoid space(s) within 1 mm central subfield  
 3.6 Eligibility criteria : modifie d inclusion criterion (eye -level) #3 replacing “an” with “most recent” as 
follows:  
(3) Macular edema (ME) defined as the presence of macular thickness greater than the 
normal range for the OCT machine being used (see cut points below), regardless of the 
presen ce of cysts, following an most recent  intravitreal corticosteroid injection (≥ 4 
weeks following intravitreal triamcinolone injection or ≥ 12 weeks following intravitreal dexamethasone implant injection);  
 4.2.4   Retreatment criteria  
 Revised retreatment criteria  
From   
Macular edema status is one of the following  
- ME does not meet the improvement definition (a 20% decrease in central subfield 
thickness of the macula or normalization of macular thickness even if there is <20% 
reduction)  
- ME worsens at the  specified time point  
- Eye has achieved normal central subfield thickness but with cystoid spaces in the 1 mm central subfield  
To 
Macular edema warrants retreatment if one or both of the following criteria are present:  
- Central subfield thickness greater than 1.1X upper limit of normal (330 µm for Zeiss and Topcon SD OCT and 352 µm for Heidelberg OCT)  
- Cystoid spaces within 1 mm central subfield

Abstract  
 Macular edema (ME) is the most common structural complication and cause of visual impairment and 
legal blindness in uveitis patients.   Traditional approaches to the treatment of uveitic ME have included 
the use of regional corticosteroid therapy, delivered periocularly, including posterior sub -Tenon’s and 
orbital floor injections, or via the intravitreal route.   While corticosteroid injections may reduce ME and 
improve vision, the effect is often variable with a limited duration. Persistent  or recurrent  macular 
edema is a common occurrence and often requires repeated intr avitreal injections of corticosteroids, 
which expose eyes to a significant risk of increased intraocular pressure ocular and cataract development. The often refractory nature of uveitic ME and its impact on visual function underscores 
the need to identify effective alternative medical therapeutic options.  Recent pilot studies have shown 
intravitreal methotrexate (MTX) and  intravitreal ranibizumab (Lucentis®, Genentech Inc., San Francisco, 
CA) to be promising treatments for uveitic ME, and intravitreal dex amethasone implant (Ozurdex®, 
Allergan, Irvine, CA) has recently been approved for uveitic ME in patients with non -infectious 
uveitis.   In addition to being effective,  intravitreal MTX and ranibizumab potentially may have less 
ocular side effects than corticosteroids, particularly less IOP elevation. However, the relative efficacy of 
these treatments is unknown. The Macular Edema Ranibizumab v. Intravitreal anti- inflammatory 
Therapy (MERIT) Trial will compare the relative efficacy and safety of intravitreal methotrexate, ranibizumab, and dexamethasone implant for persistent or recurrent macular edema.  MERIT is a 
parallel design (1:1:1), randomized comparative effectiveness trial with an anniversary close -out at the 
6-month clinic visit. The primary outcome  is percent change in central subfield thickness from the 
baseline OCT measurement to the 12 -week visit.  Secondary outcomes are:  improvement of macular 
edema based upon the MUST -accepted definition of ME improvement; resolution of macular edema 
based on the MUST- accepted definition of ME resolution (i.e., return to normative mean +/ -2 standard 
deviations of the central subfield measurement); improvement in best corrected visual acuity; adverse events (i.e., cataract and IOP elevation);  cost-effectiveness.

1.6.  Background and significance  
The uveitides consist of over 30 diseases characterized by intraocular inflammation.1  Each of 
these diseases has its own features, course, treatments, and prognosis.  Traditionally thes e 
diseases have been grouped by the primary site of inflammation as: 1) anterior uveitis (cells in 
MERIT PROTOCOL VERSI ON 1.8, 20 AUG 2020  Introduction  │ 21 
 
P:\Doc\MUST \MERIT \protocol \1.8_20 08 20 \MERIT protocol 1.8_20 Aug 2020.docx  the anterior chamber); 2) intermediate uveitis (cells in the vitreous); 3) posterior uveitis 
(chorioretinal inflammatory lesions); and 4) panuveitis (inflamm ation in the anterior chamber, 
vitreous and the choroid/retina).  Visual loss typically occurs due to structural complications of the uveitis, such as macular edema, cataract, glaucomatous optic neuropathy, epiretinal 
membrane formation, retinal neovascularization, and choroidal neovascularization. The 
frequency of visual impairment (generally defined as worse than 20/40) and blindness (generally defined as 20/200 or worse
2) vary depending on the class of the uveitis and the specific uveitic 
disease.  Among patients with anterior uveitis 19% will have visual impairment in at least one eye, whereas among patients with panuveitis as many as 59% may have visual impairment in at 
least one eye.
5  Uveitis is the 5 th or 6th leading cause of blindness in the United States3, 4 and 
accounts for ~10% of all blindness in the United Kingdom (Lightman, S, personal 
communication).  Because the uveitides affect all ages, including children, they have a muc h 
greater potential for causing years of potential vision lost than age- related diseases.  Estimates 
suggest that the cost of managing uveitis is on par with that of managing diabetic macular 
edema.6  As such, the uveitides and their management represent a substantial health problem.  
 Management of Uveitis  
The initial treatment approach to a given non- infectious uveitis depends on the anatomic class:  
anterior uveitis is treated with topical corticosteroids; intermediate uveitis often is treated initially with regional corticosteroid injections; and posterior and panuveitides often are treated with 
systemic corticosteroids and depending on the specific disease immunosuppressive agents .
1, 7  
Even when systemic agents are used, regional corticosteroid injections often are used as supplemental therapy for persistent  or recurrent macular edema, after the evident inflammation 
is controlled.  The fluocinolone acetonide implant (Retisert ®, Bausch & Lomb, Tampa , FL) is an 
alternative to systemic therapy that is similar to systemic therapy in terms of visual acuity outcomes, controls the inflammation better than systemic therapy, but has higher rates of ocular 
corticosteroid side effects, such as cataract and ocular hypertension.  The implant may have a 
particular role for patients poorly tolerant of systemic medications and those in whom systemic therapy does not adequately control the intraocular inflammation.
3   Appropriate management of 
uveitis and its complications improve outcomes. Several studies have shown that control of inflammation results in better visual outcomes
8-11 and that better control of structural 
complications, such as macular edema, is also associated with better visual outcomes.12, 13  As 
such, the proper management of uveitis and its complications is critical to maintaining/improving visual acuity among patients with uveitis.   
Macular edema is the most common structural complication of uveitis and the leading cause of 
visual loss in patients with uveitis.
5, 14, 15 In the MUST Trial, macular edema was present in 
approximately 40% of eyes with uveitis on enrollment with a similar frequency for patients with intermediate uveitis, posterior uveitis, and panuveitis.
16-18 A retrospective study from two uveitis 
referral centers in the Netherlands reported a similar proportion with uveitic macular edema 
(40%) and that macular edema accounted for 41% of visual impairment.5  Although some 
patients with intermediate uveitis (~25%) do not develop structural complications and do not need treatment, the presence of macular edema is the most common indication for treatment 
among these patients.
19, 20  Among patients with intermediate uveitis (e.g. pars planitis), a 
stepped approach is used in which regional corticosteroid injections (either periocular or 
intravitreal) are the first approach typically chosen.20, 21  Control of macular edema and 
preservation of visual acuity can be accomplished with regional corticosteroid injections only in 
30 to 50% of patients who need treatment.  For patients treated with systemic agents, including 
those with posterior uveitis and panuveitis, approximately 50% of eyes with uveitic macular 
edema will have incomplete resolution of the edema (i.e. have “persistent  macular edema”) 
despite apparent control of inflammation (defined as no inflammatory cells present in the

patients will require supplemental therapy for the macular edema.  Regional (periocular or 
intravitreal) corticosteroid injections typically are used as supplemental therapy in these 
cases.14, 15, 22-25  The proper management of uveitic macular edema is critical for the 
preservation of good visual acuity in patients with uveitis.  
Uveitic Macular Edema       
The pathophysiology of macular edema associated with uveitis is thought to be a consequence 
of increased vascular permeability from mediators released by inflammatory cells resulting in 
damage to the function of the vascular endothelium, retina, and retinal pigment epithelial cells 
and the subsequent accumulation of fluid into the macula, characteristically distributed in the 
outer plexiform layer of the retina.26  Exactly which mediators are critical in the pathogenesis of 
inflammatory macular edema is incompletely understood.  Corticosteroids have been the first 
line of treatment for noninfectious uveitis in general and of inflammatory macular edema in 
particular.  Corticosteroids inhibit the phospholipase A2 pathway, interfere with the release of 
inflammatory mediators, and decrease vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) secretion.27, 28  
Models of experimental autoimmune uveoretinitis in rats and studies in humans with uveitis and macular edema show an increased concentration of VEGF in the aqueous humor.
29-32  VEGF is 
suspected  to play a role in the loss of vascular integrity in the eye and is known to be induced 
by inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin (IL) -1 and IL -6, which have been found to be 
elevated intraocularly among patients with uveitis.32, 33  Furthermore, aqueous VEGF 
concentrations are significantly higher in those patients with uveitic macular edema than those without uveitic macular edema.
30  The recent use of intravitreally administered nonsteroidal 
medications with anti -inflammatory activity for the treatment of inflammatory macular edema, 
such as methotrexate, and those which inhibit VEGF activity, such as ranibizumab, offers 
potentially effective alternative treatment approaches to macular edema in this population and 
might obviate the well -known ocular side effects of corticosteroid- based therapies.  
Therapeutic options for uveitic macular edema  The management of uveitic macular edema initially is directed toward treatment of the underlying inflammation with appropriate medical therapy.  Control of the inflammation often 
results in resolution of the macular edema.  Regional corticosteroid injections control the 
intraocular inflammation, as well as treating the macular edema, which is why they are the initial 
therapy for 30 -50% of patients with intermediate uveitis who need treatment.  For posterior and 
panuveitis, initial therapy typically is oral corticosteroids with immunosuppression as indicated.  
Because smoking appears to increase the risk of macular edema among those with uveitis, 
smoking cessation typically is advocated.
26, 34, 35  For those patients with persistent  or recurrent  
macular edema, despite control of the evident inflammation, supplemental proposed medical treatments include regional corticosteroid injections, topical and oral nonsteroidal anti -
inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), oral acetazolamide
36, 37, intravenous infliximab infusions38, 
subcutaneous interferon -α39-41, and intravitreal injections of VEGF inhibitors, such as 
ranibizumab42.  Intravitreal methotrexate (MTX), an antimetabolite with apparent efficacy when 
systemically administered,8, 11 also has been used in pilot studies for refractory uveitis and 
persistent  macular edema.26, 43-46  Regional injections of corticosteroids are the most frequently 
used treatments specifically for uveitic macular edema.  Corticosteroid injections reduce macular edema and improve vision, but the effect has a variable duration.
47, 48  Pars plana 
vitrectomy or vitrectomy in combination with intravitreal corticosteroids have been investigated 
as treatment options for inflammatory macular edema unresponsive to medical therapy; 
however, the impact of this intervention is not clear, and a systematic review concluded that the 
efficacy of this treatment remains unproven.49, 50  The frequently persistent /recurrent  nature of 
uveitic macular edema, its impact on visual function, and the plethora of potential treatments

options and have high quality evidence to support management choices.   
Regional injections can be given periocularly or intravitreally.  For periocular injections both triamcinolone acetonide and the “depo” preparation of methylprednisolone (Depo- Medrol®, 
Pharmacia and Upjohn Company, Division of Pfizer, New York, NY) have been used, and the injections may be given as a posterior, superior sub- Tenon’s injection (PST) or as an orbital 
floor inj ection (also known as a retrobulbar injection).
24, 25, 51-63  With respect to periocular 
injections, available nonrandomized, but comparative, data suggest similar success rate with both approaches.
64-66  With respect to the choice of drug, triamcinolone acetonide is used more 
often, as it is better tolerated if there is inadvertent intraocular injection.  For intravitreal injections, initial studies were performed with the Kenalog® (Bristol -Myers Squibb, Princeton, 
NJ) preparation of triamcinolone acetonide, but more recently a preservative- free preparation of 
triamcinolone has been developed for intraocular use (Triesence) and is US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved for this approach.  The estimated pharmacologic effect of a 
regional corticosteroid injection of triamcinolone, whether given by the periocular or intravitreal 
route, is approximately 3 months, although the duration of benefit in some patients with uveitis 
may be longer. The dexamethasone intravitreal pellet appears to have a pharmacologic effect 
for 5 months and is US FDA approved for the treatment of uveitis.  Although periocular and intravitreal injections of triamcinolone are commonly used for uveitic macular edema, there is 
regional and specialty (retina specialists vs. uveitis specialists) variation in their use without any 
comparative studies to guide the choice.  Similarly, there have been no comparative studies of 
intravitreal triamcinolone to the intravitreal dexamethasone pellet.  
Periocular corticosteroid injections:   A retrospective study from the Johns Hopkins Medical 
Institution of 126 patients (156 eyes) with uveitic macular edema who received a single periocular injection of corticosteroid reported clinical resolution of macular edema in 53% and 
57% of eyes at one month and three months after the injection, respectively.
67  Of the 83 eyes 
that had resolution of macular edema at one month, 40% had recurrence of the macular edema at three months.  Of the eyes with persistent  macular edema at one month, 40 eyes were 
treated with additional periocular injections, with an additional ~60% of those eyes having a 
clinical response one month later, for an overall success rate of approximately 80%.  Overall, a 
3-line improvement in visual acuity was observed in 52% at one month and in 57% at three 
months.  Side effects attributed to periocular corticosteroid injections included a rise in intraocular pressure (IOP) to >30 mm Hg in 19% (rate = 0.14/eye- year [EY]), newly diagnosed 
cataract in 10% (rate = 0.13/EY), and ptosis in 14% (rate = 0.09/EY).  Another similarly -sized 
retrospective study (159 eyes) evaluating PST injections of triamcinolone for uveitic macular edema reported that a single injection posed a similarly low risk of IOP elevation and cataract 
progression over a mean follow -up period of 12 months; however these side effects increased 
with repeated injections.
68  As such, a single periocular injection of triamcinolone appears to be 
effective in ~50% of patients, and a second injection to have additional benefits.  Nearly all the benefit was detected by one month after the injection with limited additional benefit over the 
ensuing two months.  These data suggest that one month after a regional injection is a 
reasonable time frame for assessing the response to therapy.  
Intravitreal corticosteroids:   A retrospective case series from Moorfields Eye Hospital in London 
of 54 patients (65 eyes) evaluated intravitreal triamcinolone in patients with uveitic macular 
edema.
55  Uveitic macular edema and visual acuity improved in 83% of eyes with a mean 12-
letter gain (2.4 lines) in best corrected visual acuity after a mean follow -up of 8 months. The 
most important side effect was raised IOP; 43% of eyes experienced an IOP rise >10 mm Hg.  Although not strictly comparable, these data suggest that intravitreal triamcinolone may be 
superior to periocular triamcinolone for the treatment of uveitic macular edema, but that the 
MERIT PROTOCOL VERSI ON 1.8, 20 AUG 2020  Introduction  │ 24 
 
P:\Doc\MUST \MERIT \protocol \1.8_20 08 20 \MERIT protocol 1.8_20 Aug 2020.docx  frequency of elevated IOP may be greater.  Similarly, a non- randomized, historically controlled 
study comparing the ocular side effects of peri ocular triamcinolone to intravitreal triamcinolone 
for macular edema from various causes demonstrated a significantly increased frequency of 
IOP> 30 mm Hg and the more frequent need for anti -glaucoma medication among the 
intravitreal -treated eyes.69  Studies of intravitreal triamcinolone for persistent  macular edema 
after systemic therapy controls the evident inflammation, including those from Moorfields Eye Hospital, suggest clinical resolution of the macular edema in 85% of eyes.  Collectively, these 
data suggest that the intravitreal route may be more effective than the periocular route for the 
management of uveitic macular edema, but that the intravitreal route may be associated with a 
greater rate of ocular corticosteroid side effects.
26,55,62,63  The major limitation of intravitreal 
triamcinolone are its corticosteroid -related adverse ocular effects.  The frequency of cataract 
development has been reported to range from 15 -30% after a single injection70-73 and increase 
with repeated inje ctions.74, 75  Corticosteroid- induced IOP elevations have been reported to 
occur in 25% to 45% of patients55, 70-72, 76 are dose dependent77, 78 and may be more frequent 
among children.47  In most instances, elevated IOP is transient and may be controlled with anti -
glaucoma medications.58, 79  Alth ough the long- term prognosis of uveitic macular edema treated 
with repetitive intravitreal triamcinolone is uncertain, a recent report demonstrated improved 
best corrected visual acuity with no evidence of tachyphylaxis to repeated intravitreal injections of triamcinolone and no evidence of increased rates of IOP elevation after the first injection.  
However, cataract progression requiring surgery was seen in all phakic patients by the fifth 
injection.
80   
In an effort to address the limited duration of action of intravitreal triamcinolone, sustained releas e implants have been developed and approved by the FDA, including the dexamethasone 
implant, Ozurdex.  This implant is a copolymer containing dexamethasone, lactic acid and 
glycolic acid, which releases dexamethasone over a six month period as it degrades slowly into 
carbon dioxide and water.  It is administered as an office based injection into the vitreous 
cavity.
81-87  The safety and efficacy of a single intravitreal injection of two dexamethasone pellet 
doses (0.7mg and 0.35mg) was reported from the HURON study, a 26 -week, phase III, 
prospective, multicenter, masked, sham injection -controlled, randomized clinical trial among 229 
patients with noninfectious intermediate or posterior uveitis.88  Patients were randomized 1:1:1 
to receive the higher -dose (0.7mg) pellet, the lower -dose (0.35mg) pellet, or a sham injection.  
The primary outcome was control of vitreous inflammation.  Although both implant doses were 
shown to be effective in controlling vitreous inflammation and in improving visual acuity, the higher dose implant proved to have a longer duration of action without a significant increase in 
untoward ocular side effects and is the dose currently in clinical use. At 8 weeks after injections, 
43% of treated eyes versus 7% in the sham group had at least a 15- letter improvement from 
baseline best corrected visual acuity, and the proportion of eyes achieving this level of improvement was 2- to 6-fold greater in the dexamethasone pellet groups as compared to the 
sham group at each visit throughout the study period.  Evaluation of macular edema was 
performed with time -domain OCT, and there was a significant decrease in the mean macular 
thickness for both treatment groups ( -99 µm for the higher -dose group and -91 µm for the lower -
dose group) when compared to the sham- treated group -12 µm, P<0.004) at the eight -week 
visit.  The proportion of eyes with improvement and/or resolution of the macular edema were not reported.  The percentage of eyes with IOP ≥25 mm Hg peaked at 7.1% for the higher -dose 
implant group, 8.7% for the lower - dose implant group, and 4.2% for the sham -treated group.  At 
26 weeks, there was no statistically significant difference in the occurrence of cataract among groups (15% higher -dose, 12% lower -dose, and 7% sham -treated) with no patient requiring 
cataract surgery.  However, patients with a history of an elevated IOP related to topical or regional injection corticosteroids were excluded from this study, so the comparative rate of IOP 
elevation vs. intravitreal triamcinolone is uncertain.  Subsequent small, retrospective case series 
MERIT PROTOCOL VERSI ON 1.8, 20 AUG 2020  Introduction  │ 25 
 
P:\Doc\MUST \MERIT \protocol \1.8_20 08 20 \MERIT protocol 1.8_20 Aug 2020.docx  also reported that the dexamethasone pellet was effective in treating noninfectious posterior 
uveitis with outcomes including decreased inflammatory activity, improved visual acuity, and an 
improvement in macular edema as evidenced by a reduction in mean central retinal thickness 
on optical coherence tomography  (OCT).  However, these studies suggest that the duration of 
effect may be shorter (3- 4 months) in clinical practice than that reported in the HURON trial.89-91 
Although the side effect profile of the dexamethasone pellet appears to be superior to that of intravitreal triamcinolone, the study design of the HURON trial limits the ability to compare 
results.  
Differing methodologies and different enrollment criteria substantially hamper comparing the data from these different studies.  One of the most substantial differences is the methodology 
used to evaluate macular edema.  Clinical estimates of macular edema improvement are heavily  influenced by visual acuity improvement and may overestimate the resolution rate and 
the apparent efficacy of interventions on macular edema.  Fluorescein angiography and OCT measure somewhat different aspects of macular edema, vascular leakage and retinal thickness, 
respectively.  Although the two methods correlate, the correlation is moderate, as compensated 
leakage may not result in thickening, and thickening may occur without evident leakage.
4  Of the 
three methods (OCT, fluorescein angiography, clinical examination), clinical examination is least likely to detect macular edema.
4  Visual acuity loss correlates better with retinal thickness than 
with the two -dimensional area of leakage.92  Even though vision is influenced by multiple 
factors, such as media opacity, change in macular thickness on OCT correlate with visual acuity improvement
93, suggesting that as a single measure of macular edema response for 
comparative studies, retinal thickness on OCT is a good one.       
Taken together these data suggest that intravitreal triamcinolone may be a more effective initial treatment than periocular triamcinolone, as the intravitreal route may be superior for the delivery 
of corticosteroids.  However, the side effects of intravitreal triamcinolone may be greater than 
those of periocular triamcinolone.  Finally, the intravitreal dexamethasone pellet may have lower 
rates of side effects than those of intravitreal triamcinolone.  However, the limited comparability 
of the different studies, the lack of comparative trials, and the widespread variation in use of these different agents all suggest that a clinical trial is needed to guide management.  
Furthermore, a relatively short -term trial with macular thickness on OCT as a comparative 
measure may be adequate to evaluate relative efficacy.  Somewhat longer -term follow -up (e.g. 
6 months) is  needed to evaluate the duration of response and the need for additional injections. 
The MUST Research Group is conducting the PeriOcul ar and INTravitreal  corticosteroids for 
uveitic macular edema  (POINT)  Trial which was designed to evaluate the comparative 
effectiveness of periocular triamcinolone injections, intravitreal  triamcinolone injections, and 
intravitreal injections of the dexamethasone pellet  for the initial regional treatment of  uveitic  
macular edema.  POINT is funded by the same grant and is the companion study for the MERIT 
Trial.  
Management of Persistent Macular Edema       
Despite appropriate management, up to 50% of eyes with macular edema will not fully resolve and will have persistent  macular edema.
16  Although these eyes often are treated with additional 
regional corticosteroid injections, not all patients will improve, and alternative agents have been explored.  In addition, the occurrence of substantial rises in IOP (e.g. to 35- 40 mm Hg), while 
uncom mon, and to a lesser extent the occurrence of cataract, has prompted the search for 
alternative, non -steroid regional treatments.  Two agents that have been investigated have been 
intravitreal methotrexate injections and intravitreal anti -VEGF injections, such as ranibizumab.  
Methotrexate  
Methotrexate is an antimetabolite, administered weekly either orally or parenterally, used 
extensively in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and used for uveitis requiring 
MERIT PROTOCOL VERSI ON 1.8, 20 AUG 2020  Introduction  │ 26 
 
P:\Doc\MUST \MERIT \protocol \1.8_20 08 20 \MERIT protocol 1.8_20 Aug 2020.docx  immunosuppression, particularly juvenile idiopathic arthritis -associated chronic anterior uveitis.  
Intravitreal methotrexate has been used successfully in the treatment of primary intraocular 
lymphoma without the occurrence of substantial adverse ocular effects.94, 95  A dose of 
400µg/0.1 mL is well tolerated by the retinal tissue and remains in a therapeutic concentration 
for 48- 72 hours.96 Several case series have suggested efficacy for intravitreal injections of 
methotrexate (400µg/0.1 mL) for the treatment of chronic intermediate uveitis and posterior 
uveitis and for inflammatory macular edema .97-100  A six-month pilot study of patients with active 
intermediate, posterior, or panuveitis from Moorfields Eye Hospital examined the effect of a 
single intravitreal injection of methotrexate on visual acuity and macular edema.98  Overall, 87% 
(13/15) of patients responded with significantly  improved visual acuity, significantly reduced 
macular thickness on OCT, and significantly reduced ocular inflammatory scores.  The onset of 
action appeared to be within one week of administration with a mean duration of effect of four 
months .  Visual improvements were similar to those seen with previous injections of intravitreal 
triamcinolone.  Patients who underwent a second injection had a similar response.  No patients 
had an increase in IOP.  The onl y evident treatment related side effect was corneal 
epitheliopathy  in one patient, occurring  two months following the initial injection .  These data 
suggest that intravitreal methotrexate may be effective for the treatment of uveitis and of uveitic macular  edema and that it may have lower rates of the ocular side effects of elevated IOP and 
cataract.  However, the relative merits of this approach vs. repeat injections of intravitreal 
triamcinolone are unknown.  
Ranibizumab  Ranibizumab is a recombinant, humanized monoclonal antibody antigen -binding fragment 
(Fab) to VEGF, that neutralizes VEGF, and currently  approved by the FDA for the treatment of 
choroidal neovascularization in age- related macular degeneration (AMD) , diabetic macular 
edema, and macular edem a associated with retinal vein occlusions.  Bevacizumab ( Avastin ®, 
Genentech, Inc. , San Francisco, CA), an  anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody and the parent 
molecule of the Fab fragment ranibizumab, was  initially approved for the treatment of colorectal 
cancer , and is being used off -label for indications  similar to those for ranibizumab.  Studies 
leading to ranibizumab’s approval for macular degeneration demonstrated a very low incidence 
of cataracts, elevated IOP and other adverse events, thus making it an attractive option with 
regard to safety.
101, 102  The two- year results of the Comparison of Age- related Macular 
Degeneration Treatments Trial (CATT) supports the use of either drug as primary therapy for choroidal neovascularization associated with AMD, and also suggests that modification of monthly –dosing  regimens may be  feasible.
103, 104  One potential advantage of using ranibizumab 
instead of bevacizumab is that it has been shown to be 5- to 20 -fold more potent than full- length 
bevacizumab in bioassays measuring inhibition of human VEGF- induced endothelial cell 
mitogenesis.105  Clinically, in CATT, monthly injections of ranibizumab were the most effective in 
terms of proportion of eyes without fluid on OCT.  
The safety and efficacy of ranibizumab for the treatment of patients with diabetic macular 
edema and macular edema due to retinal vein occlusion have been demonstrated in clinical 
trials which led to US FDA approval  for these indications .106, 107  Two multicenter randomized 
double- masked sham  injection -controlled clinical trials in adult  patients with diabetic macular 
edema showed a significant improvement in best corrected visual acuity  at 24 months in the 
ranibizumab- treated group compared to the group receiving sham injections .  Mean change in 
central foveal thickness also was significantly better in ranibizumab- treated patients, with a 
mean decrease of 255 µm  in central foveal thickness at 24 months in the ranibizumab group, 
compared with a 130 µm decrease in the sham  injection  group (P < 0.0001 ). Less than 5% of 
patients experienced an ocular adverse event, such as  endophthalmitis, retinal detachment or 
vitreous hemorrha ge, by 24 months.  Ranibizumab also is approved for the treatment of  macular 
edema following branch retinal vein occlusion.108, 109  A phase III multicenter , randomized, 
MERIT PROTOCOL VERSI ON 1.8, 20 AUG 2020  Introduct ion │ 27 
 
P:\Doc\MUST \MERIT \protocol \1.8_20 08 20 \MERIT protocol 1.8_20 Aug 2020.docx  double- masked , controlled study followed by a 6- month observation period showed a significant 
improvement in best corrected visual acuity ( 18.3 letters from baseline) compared with the sham  
injection group ( 7.3 letters, P < 0.0001).  A significant improvement in central  foveal thickness 
also occurred in the ranibizumab group (decrease of 345 µm at 6 months), compared with the 
sham  injection  group  (158 µm decrease, P < 0.001 ).  The safety profile of ranibizumab was 
consistent with prior p hase  III clinical trials of ranibizumab in neovascular age -related macular 
degeneration, with a very low rate of endophthalmitis, retinal tear/detachment and arterial 
thromboembolic events.  A second p hase  III trial on vein occlusion enrolled patients with 
macular edema  following central retinal vein occlusion and showed similar efficacy and safety 
as the trial evaluating  branch retinal vein occlusion.110, 111  
The use of intra vitreal  anti-VEGF drugs has been explored for the treatment of uveitic macular 
edema, but has yet to be studied systematically for this indication.   There have been two 
prospective uncontrolled studies evaluating the effect of intravitreal ranibizumab injections on 
macular edema  in patients with controlled uveitis who failed regional corticosteroid injections .  
The first, performed at the University of California, San Francisco,42 was a prospective, 
uncontrolled case series, in which patients with inactive uveitis and persistent  macular edema  
who had failed periocular corticosteroid treatment were given intravitreal ranibizumab injections 
(0.5 mg) monthly for 3 months, followed by re- injection as needed for the presence of macular 
edema.  The primary outcome was the mean change best corrected visual acuity  from baseline 
to three  months, and the secondary outcome was the mean change in central retinal thickness 
on OCT.   At three  months, the mean increase in acuity was 13 letters (2.5 lines) , and the mean 
decrease in central retinal thickness was 357 μm.   Both best corrected visual acuity  and central 
retinal thickness improved significantly between baseline and three  months (P=0.0 3 for each). 
Although most patients required re -injection, the treatment success was maintained at 6 
months. There were no significant ocular or systemic adverse effects.  Hence,  intravitreal  
ranibizumab led to an incre ase in visual  acuity  and improv ement  in uveitis -associated macular 
edema in patients  refractory  to or intolerant of  standard, regional corticoster oid therapy .   
The second prospective study, conducted at the Bascom Palmer Eye Institute, was  a study of 
patients with controlled noninfectious uveitis and persistent  macular edema that tested the effect 
of monthly ranibizumab (intravitreal injections, with repeated injections determined based on increase or persistence of retinal thickening or of cystoid spaces) .  Mean best corrected visual 
acuity  improvement  over 12 months  was 12 letters  on a logarithmic visual acuity chart  (P=0.02  
for comparison with baseline) and mean reduction in central retinal thickness was 45% (P=0.006  vs. baseline).
112  These data are highly suggestive that intravitreal ranibizumab 
injections will be useful for the treatment of uveitic macular edema, but there are caveats.  The sample size for both studies was small, so the side effect profile has to be inferred from the use 
of ranibizumab for other forms of macular edema and for neovascular AMD.  However, the data 
set for the relative safely of ranibizumab is substantial and the side effects consistent across diseases.  The second is that ranibizumab does not treat the inflammation
113 and appears to be 
most useful for persistent  macular edema in patients with controlled inflammation, which is the 
type of patients treated in the pilot studies.  This role is consistent with ranibizumab’s known 
effect on vascular permeability and apparent lack of effect on inflammatory pathways.   
Bevacizumab has also been investigated as an off -label treatment for uveitic macular edema.114-
117  In two retrospective case series, one of which was conducted at the Massachusetts Eye 
Research and Surgery Institute , intravitreal injections of bevacizumab were associated with a 
short -term significant improvement in uveitic macular edema  as measured by OCT.115, 116  
However, neither study found a statistically significant improvement in visual acuity , and the 
magnitude of the  improvement in macular  thickness appeared to be  less than that reported in 
MERIT PROTOCOL VERSI ON 1.8, 20 AUG 2020  Introduction  │ 28 
 
P:\Doc\MUST \MERIT \protocol \1.8_20 08 20 \MERIT protocol 1.8_20 Aug 2020.docx  the previously cited studies with ranibizum ab.  As these studies were not prospective and did 
not follow an identical protocol for all patients, it is difficult to directly compare outcomes.  
 In sum, these data suggest that persistent  macular edema despite therapy for the inflammation 
remains a problem.  The typical treatment of reinjection with a regional corticosteroid has some 
benefit, but that alternate treatments may prove to be better either in terms of efficacy or of the 
side ef fect profile.  The absence of any comparative trials in this situation is problematic for 
developing evidence- based guidelines for the management of uveitic macular edema.  A 
randomized clinical trial evaluating the comparative effectiveness of another cor ticosteroid 
injection with the alternate treatments of intravitreal methotrexate and of anti -VEGF agents is 
needed.  
 
1.7. Preliminary studies  
The MUST Research Group is a multicenter, clinical trials research group focused on trials on the management of uveitis and its structural complications.  The original MUST Trial was a comparative effectiveness of  the fluocinolone acetonide implant to the conventional approach 
of oral corticosteroids and immunosuppression as needed for non- infectious intermediate, 
posterior, and panuveitis.  The 2 -year results have been published
16, and a long- term follow -up 
study is ongoing.  Results of the MUST Trial most directly relevant to this protocol are the 
estimates of macular edema in eyes with intermediate, posterior, or panuveitis (~ 40%) on presentation, fraction of patients with bilateral disease (~ 25%), and the persistence of macular 
edema among eyes with uveitic macular edema (~50% overall)
16, 18.   
Also relevant are the MUST data on the comparability of clinical observation, fluorescein angiography, and OCT for identification of uveitic macular edema
17.  These data show that 
visual acuity is more closely related to retinal thickness among patients with uveitic macular 
edema92, and indicate that OCT outcomes are appropriate measures for clinical trials of uveitic 
macular edema.  Two levels of response are possible:  1) resolution, a return to normal, typically normal thickness; and 2) improvement, a clinically meaningful change that may or may not 
return to normal, but is indicative of a response to therapy.  Because of the proliferation of OCT 
machines with slightly different normal ranges, change in retinal thickness is best expressed as a percent change so that it is machine independent.  Percent change in retinal thickness is 
analogous to approach used for visual acuity, where changes in the visual angle are used as 
clinical trials outcomes.  Change in best corrected visual acuity  on a logarithmic  acuity chart  
(e.g. E TDRS charts)  typically is used, and a change of >5 letters is greater than measurement 
variability and changes of >10 letters and > 15 letters often are used as outcomes in trials.
118   
Although previous data suggested that the inter -measurement variability of OCT, regardless of 
machine, was <10%, and that a 20% change in macular thickness was highly reproducible,119-124 
prior to the MUST Trial it was unclear what level of clinical change in macular thickness was 
clinically meaningful.93  In order to determine the optimal threshold for considering macular 
thickness improved (and thereby macular edema), data from the MUST Trial were analyzed to determine the threshold for a change in retinal thickness on OCT that best correlated with a 
change in best corrected visual acuity.
93  There was a strong association between a 20% 
reduction in retinal thickness and 5 -letter, 10 -letter, and 15- letter improvements in best 
corrected visual acuity (P<0.0001 for the 5 -letter change); the agreement for a 20% reduction in 
thickness and a 5- letter improvement in visual acuity was 83% (95% CI 70- 93%).  The 20% 
change appeared optimal on receiver operator characteristic cur ve analyses.  The sensitivity, 
specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of a 20% decrease in retinal thickness for a 5 -letter improvement in visual acuity were 72%, 93%, 79%, and 90%, 
respectively.  After adjusting for baseline acuity, the mean difference in the improvement in best 
MERIT PROTOCOL VERSI ON 1.8, 20 AUG 2020  Introduction  │ 29 
 
P:\Doc\MUST \MERIT \protocol \1.8_20 08 20 \MERIT protocol 1.8_20 Aug 2020.docx  corrected visual acuity for eyes with a > 20% decrease in retinal thickness vs. those with a 
<20% decrease was 10.4 letters (P<0.01).  These data suggest that retinal thickness on OCT 
can be used as a clinically meaningful outcome in trials of treatments for uveitic macular edema. 
Furthermore, the percent change threshold allows future trials to use newer OCT machines once the normal range has been determined, as the outcome (percent change) is machine 
independent.  These data are supportive of the rationale for the outcomes chosen for the POINT and MERIT trials.   
Much of the preliminary data for the  MERIT Trial (and for the companion trial POINT)  have been 
generated by MUST Research Group investigator s.  The data on periocular triamcinolone 
injections for uveitic macular edema were generated by the Johns Hopkins clinical center.67  
Several studies evaluating intravitreal triamcinolone injections for the treatment of uveitic macular edema were performed at Moorfields Eye Hospital by the investigators at the MUST 
clinical center in London, UK.
55    Preliminary data on intravitreal methotrexate also were 
generated by the MUST investigators at the MUST center in London98, 99  Two of the studies 
evaluating intravitreal ranibizumab injections for persistent  macular edema have been 
performed at MUST clinical centers42, 114  Collectively the MUST investigators are leaders in the 
field of uveitis and have provided much of the information used to design the  MERIT and 
POINT clinical trials.   
 
1.8. Rationale for trial  
Although regional corticosteroid injections reduce macular edema and improve vision in many patients, the effect is variable, and up to 50% of eyes with uveitic macular edema have 
persistent  edema, despite control of the inflammation.
16 Furthermore,  the ocular side  effects , of 
increas ed IOP and cataract  formation, have been  reported  in a substantial  proporti on of patients 
treated with regional corticosteroid injection s, and an increase in the risk of such side effects 
(e.g. cataract formation) may increase with multiple injectio ns.73, 78, 125  Hence there is a need for 
alternative agents with a different side effect profile (or lower rates of side effects).  
Ranibizumab is a recombinant,  humanized monoclonal  antibody  that is FDA-approved for the 
treatment  of choroidal neovascularization in  AMD , diabetic macular edema, and macular edema 
after retinal vein occlusion.101-105, 126   Phase III studies  leading  to ranibizumab’s  approval  for 
AMD  and post-m arketing  surveillance data demonstrate  a low incidence of cataracts,  and 
elevated IOP, sugg esting  favorable safety  vis-à-vis corticosteroids.  Pilot studies  of ranibizumab 
for uveitic  macular edema showed statis tically  and clinic ally significa nt improv ements in both 
macular edema  and best corrected visual acuity .42  There is also evidence that i ntravitreal 
methotrexate, which also has a low rate of ocular complications, is a promising treatment for  
uveitic  macular edema.97-100  The g oal of the MERIT  Trial is to compare  the relative 
effectiveness  of a repeat corticosteroid injection for persistent  or recurrent  macular edema in 
eyes with controlled inflammation (the current standard approach), versus each of the alternative non-corticosteroid modalities ( intravitreal  ranibizumab or  intravitreal methotrexate) for 
the treatment  of uveitic  macular edema that is persistent  or recurrs  after an intravitreal 
corticosteroid injection .  Because many of these patients now are treated  with the alternative 
corticosteroid (i.e. the dexamethasone pellet) rather than the reinjection of the same drug, the 
corticosteroid used for intravitreal injection in this study will be the dexamethasone pellet. T he 
preliminary  data suggest that alternat ive treatments (i.e., ranibizumab and methotrexate) may 
have greater efficacy in the situation . The MERIT  Trial will be important  in de termining the role 
of these alternative non- corticosteroid intravitreal therapies  in the treatment  of uveitic macular 
edema persisting  or recurring  after successful control  of the uveitis.

2.1. Objective 
The MERIT Trial  was designed to find out which intravitreal therapy offers the best balance of 
effectiveness and tolerability in treating persistent  or recurrent  uveitic macular edema in eyes 
with controlled uveitis, specifically by comparing  the relative efficacy and safety of intravitreal 
ranibizumab (Lucentis®) and intravitreal methotrexate to intravitreal dexamethasone implant 
(Ozurdex®) for the treatment of persistent /recurrent uveitic macular edema.  
 
2.2. Hypotheses  
(1) Intravitreal injections of methotrexate will have greater efficacy than intravitreal 
injections of the dexamethasone pellet as a treatment for uveitic macular edema 
persisting  or recurring after treatment with an intravitreal corticosteroid injection. 
  
(2) Intravitreal injections of ranibizumab will have greater efficacy than intravitreal injections of the dexamethasone pellet as a treatment for uveitic macular edema 
persis ting or recurring after treatment with an intravitreal corticosteroid injection.

3. Design  
 
3.1. Type of study  
• Randomized, three -arm, parallel design,  randomized comparative effectiveness trial  
• Randomization stratified by presence or absence of concomitant systemic corticosteroid 
and/or immunosuppressive therapy for any indication  
• Unit of randomization is patient, not eye; if both eyes  meet eligibility criteria, both receive 
same treatment  
• Allocation ratio (1:1:1)  
• Multi center  
• Fixed sample size, 240 (80 per treatment group)  
• Anniversary close- out at t he 6-month clinic visit   
• Reading center graders and visual acuity examiners will be masked to treatment 
• Treating physicians and patients will be unmasked (the intravitreal therapies are different in appearance and have potentially different injection schedules)
 
 
3.2. Treatment arms  
• Ozurdex (0.7 mg dexamethasone pellet) delivered via intravitreal injection 
• Methotrexate 400 µg in 0.1 mL via intravitreal injection  
• Ranibizumab (Lucentis) 0.5 mg in 0.05 mL via intravitreal injection

The primary outcome is  the percent change in central subfield thickness from the baseline OCT 
measurement at the 12 -week visit.  The assessment of OCT outcomes will be performed by 
masked readers.  The 12 -week visit was chosen as the time to assess the primary outcome 
because the ranibizumab treatment arm specifies injections at baseline (i.e., post -
randomization) , 4 weeks and 8 weeks in all participants, and because the peak benefit for the 
dexamethasone pellet appears to be at the 8 to 12 weeks.  
 
3.5. Secondary outcomes  
• Rate s of IOP elevation of ≥24 mm Hg, ≥30 mm  Hg, and   ≥ 10 mm Hg from baseline 
during the 24 weeks of follow -up  
• Percent change in macular thickness as measured by OCT over the 24 weeks of follow -
up 
• Proportion of eyes with macular edema events over the 24 weeks of follow -up 
- ≥20% reduction in macular thickness (or normalization of macular thickness even 
if there is <20% reduction)  
- ”Resolution”, defined as normalization of the macular thickness , i.e., <260 um on 
the standard scale Worsening defined as a 20% increase in macular thickness 
from the lowest value after an injection 
- “Recurrence” defined as >20% increase in the central subfield measurement on 
OCT to an abnormal value in an eye that previously had resolution of ME  
• Mean change in BCVA over the 24 weeks of follow -up.  
Best-corrected visual acuity score will be measured at every study visit under 
standardized lighting conditions by certified study examiners masked to study treatment 
using logarithmic (ETDRS) visual acuity  charts,  according to the method described by 
Ferris, et al .127 
• Safety outcomes  including elevated IOP ( >30 mm Hg thresholds ); vitreo us hemorrhage;  
retinal  tear/detachment;  endopht halmitis ; severe vision loss (≥15 Early  Treatment

4.1. Overview  
• Study participants are  randomized to receive one of three treatments  in eye(s) meeting 
eye-level eligibility criteria  at baseline ( M01)  
 
Note:  If only one eye is eligible at baseline then that  eye will be the only study eye 
throughout the trial.  If the second eye “meets el igibility criteria ” later at a later time 
point , the second eye does not become a study eye.  Rather the second eye is  treated 
per best medical judgment of the study/  treating ophthalmologist . 
 
• The timing of  initial injections  of assigned treatment , required 2nd and 3rd injections in 
ranibizumab group, and retreatment  for all groups  are specified in section 4.2 below  
 
• All injections of study treatments must be administered per protocol instructions and follow  relevant  IOP pre-injection criteria  
- Initial injection of study treatment:  IOP ≤ 21 mm Hg  and ≤ 3 IOP -lowering  
agents  
- Retreatment :  IOP  < 25 mm Hg  and  ≤ 3 IOP-lowering  
agents   
 
• Pregnancy testing required for women of childbearing potential before additional 
intravitreal injections of methotrexate or ranibizumab  
 
• Treatment according to the best medical judgment of  study ophthalmologist is 
permitted as deemed necessary. Repeat injections given before the protocol specified time points  (section 4.2 .6) or other deviations from the treatment protocol should be 
reported expeditiously to CC on Unanticipated Event (UA) form.

• Prepare eye for injection using the following sequence of s teps:  
- Consider placing 2- 3 drops of 5% povidone iodine in the lower fornix and/or using 
sterile cotton -tipped applicators soaked in 5% or 10% povidone iodine to swab 
the upper and lower eyelid margins and the upper and lower eyelashes  
(Optional)  
-  Retract t he eyelids and lashes away from the injection site and needle for the 
duration of the procedure (use of an eyelid speculum is optional)  
- Consider additional anesthesia with the application of one or two cotton -tipped 
applicators soaked in topical anesthetic over the intended injection site for at 
least 30 seconds. The use of lidocaine gel or other types of viscous anesthetic 
(e.g. TetraVisc ™) is also permitted.

P:\Doc\MUST \MERIT \protocol \1.8_20 08 20 \MERIT protocol 1.8_20 Aug 2020.docx   A subconjunctival anesthetic can be used in specific circumstances in 
which  the study ophthalmologist believes that topical anesthetic is not 
sufficient to minimize discomfort 
- Encourage the study participant to look superonasally during the application of 
povidone iodine.  Apply one of the following to the conjunctiva directly over and 
surrounding the intended injection site:  
 A cotton- tipped applicator soaked in 5% or 10% povidone iodine   
 A 10% povidone iodine Swabstick  
 At least 1- 3 drops of 5% povidone iodine (at least enough to cover the 
intended injection site)  
- Allow 30 -60 seconds for the povidone iodine to be in contact with the injection 
site before injection.   
• Use a sterile 4×4 pad in a single wipe to absorb excess liquid and to dry the periocular 
skin.  
 
NOTE: As indicated above, injection preparation must  include the use of povidone- iodine 
either applied directly to the injection site using topical drops, a cotton-tipped applicator, or 
swabstick .  If a study participant experiences an adverse reaction to povidone- iodine, other 
approaches to limit the exposure of povidone- iodine may be permitted.  However, a study 
participant may not receive an intravitreal injection without use of povidone-iodine  
directly to the injection site just prior to the injection.    
 
Examples of approaches that may be used in study participants with prior adverse reactions 
associated with povidone- iodine include using a limited amount of povidone- iodine by 
placing a swab directly on the injection site after the lid speculum has been placed or the 
eyelids and lashes have been retracted by other means, subsequently ensuring that nothing 
further touches that site before the injection. Alternatively, study ophthalmologist could 
consider using povidone- iodine and then gently irrigating the eye with sterile saline after the 
injection to try to rinse away any remaining povidone- iodine or gently applying a sterile 
cotton tipped applicator adjacent to the intended injection site to immediately absorb excess povidone- iodine that has been placed

• Hold the applicator in one hand and pull the safety tab straight off the applicator. Do not twist or flex the tab.  
• The long axis of the applicator should be held parallel to the limbus  
• Displace the conjunctiva with a cotton t ip applicator held in the non- dominant hand  
• The sclera should be engaged at an oblique angle with the bevel of the needle up (away 
from the s clera) to create a shelved scleral path.  
• The tip of the needle is advanced within the sclera for about 1 mm (parallel to the limbus), then re -directed toward the center of the eye and advanced until penetration of

Ranibizumab is formulated as a sterile solution aseptically filled in a sterile 0.3 mL stoppered 
glass vial  or in a prefilled syringe .  Each single -use vial  or prefilled syringe is designed to deliver 
0.05 mL of 10 mg/mL ranibizumab aqueous solution with 10 mM histidine HCI, 10%, a- trehalose 
dihydrate, and 0.01% polysorbate 20, pH 5.5.  This results in the delivery of a 0.5 mg dose o f 
ranibizumab.  Each vial and prefilled syringe contains no preservative and is suitable for single 
use only.   Either vials or prefilled syringes may be used.  
 
Note s:   
• The volume fill for the ranibizumab vials donated by Genentech for U.S. clinical centers 
was changed from 0.3 mL to 0.23 mL beginning with the drug distributed in August 2018 
but the vial size (0.3 mL) did not change] 
• After Mar 2020, Genentech will provide ranibizumab for U.S. clinical centers as  0.5 mg 
dose prefilled syringes.  
 
5.5.2.  Storage of ranibizumab

8. Safety reporting of a dverse and other  event s  
 
8.1. General overview  
Adverse event s (AEs)  will be record ed on study  data forms  and submitted  to the CC. Serious  
adverse events  (SAEs),  which  include death,  all hospit alizations,  life-threatening  illness, 
overdose, or congenital abnormalities  in the offspring  of subjects, will be reported  to the CC as 
SAE reports  within  72 hours  after clinical cen ter personnel  become  aware of the event.  An 
assessment will be made  by the clinical investigator  at the managing clinical center  as to 
whether  the event  is related to treatment.   Dr. Akrit Sodhi, the CC Safety Officer , and Dr. Alan 
Palestine, the DSMC  Safety  Officer, have been commissioned to review  all adverse events  and 
to make  recommendatio ns to the DSMC  as to any actions  that may be needed.  All  SAEs  will 
be reported  expeditiously  regardless  of the relationship of treatment.  These reports  will be sent 
to the CC Medical Safety  Officer  for immediate  review and determination as to whether  the 
event  meets  the criteria  for a safety  report . Any SAE reports of a subject death will be sent to 
DSMC Me dical Safety Officer within 24 hours of  receipt at the CC.  Non -death SAE reports will 
be sent to the DSMC Medical Safety Officer within 7 days of receipt at the CC.  The DSMC 
Medical Safety Officer will review  each report  to determine what , if any , additional actions  are 
needed, including whether the other DSMC members need to be informed of the event 
immediately as opposed to waiting for the next DSMC meeting or conference call.  All serious  
and unexpected events  poss ibly related to study  treatment  will be reported  as s afety  reports  to 
the NEI project  officer, the FDA, the pharmaceutical  supplier  (where appropriate),  and all 
clinical centers in accordance with FDA regulations.  The CC  and clinical centers  will submit  all 
safety  reports  as expedi ted reports  to their IRBs.  Reports  of AEs not deemed to be unexpected 
will be submitted  to the CC IRB, to the IRB of the clinical center in which  the event was  
reported,  as well as to any other  study  center  IRBs  which  require such re ports.  
 
S
pecific adverse event reporting requirements and instructions are detailed in the MERIT 
Manual of Procedures.  
 
 
8.2. Assessment  of Safety  
8.2.1.  Specification of Safety Variables  
Safety assessments will consist of monitoring and reporting adverse events (AEs) and serious 
adverse events (SAEs) that are considered related to any of the study treatments ( intravitreal 
dexamethasone pellet (Ozurdex); intravitreal methotrexate; intravitreal ranibizumab ( Lucentis ), 
all events of death, and any study specific issue of concern.  
 
8.2.2.  Adverse Events  
An AE is any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with 
the use of an investigational medicinal product (IMP) or other protocol -imposed intervention, 
regardless of attribution.  
 
This includes the following:  
• AEs not previously observed in the subject that emerge during the protocol -specified AE 
reporting period, including signs or symptoms associated with uveitic macular edema  
that were not present prior to the AE reporting period.  
• Complications that occur as a result of protocol -mandated interventions . 
 
MERIT PROTOCOL VERSI ON 1.8, 20 AUG 2020  Safety reporting of adverse and other events  │ 51 
 
P:\Doc\MUST \MERIT \protocol \1.8_20 08 20 \MERIT protocol 1.8_20 Aug 2020.docx  If applicable, AEs that occur prior to assignment of study treatment associated with medication 
washout, no treatment run- in, or other protocol -mandated intervention.  
 Preexisting medical conditions (other than the condition being studied) judged by the 
investigator to have worsened in severity or frequency or changed in character during the 
protocol -specified AE reporting period.  
 
8.2.3.  Serious Adverse Events 
An AE should be classified as an SAE if the following criteria are met:  
• It results in death (i.e., the AE actually causes or leads to death).  
• It is life threatening (i.e.,  the AE, in the view of the investigator, places the subject at 
immediate risk of death. It does not include an AE that, had it occurred in a more severe 
form, might have caused death.)  
• It requires or prolongs inpatient hospitalization.  
• It results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (i.e., the AE results in substantial disruption of the subject’s ability to conduct normal life functions).  
• It results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect in a neonate/infant born to a mother exposed to the IMP.  
• It is considered a significant medical event by the investigator based on medical judgment (e.g., may jeopardize the subject or may require medical/surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above).  
8.3. Methods and timing for assessing and recording safety variables  
The clinical center investigator is responsible for ensuring that all AEs and SAEs that are 
observed or reported during the study, are collected and reported to the Coordinating Center  
and their governing IRB.  The Coordinating Center is  responsible for reported events to the 
FDA, appropriate IRB(s), and Genentech, Inc. in accordance with CFR 312.32 (IND Safety Reports).  
 
8.3.1.  Adverse Event Reporting Period  
• The study period during which all AEs and SAEs must be reported begins afte r informed 
consent is obtained and initiation of study treatment [or “initiation of any study 
procedures”] and ends 30 days  following the last administration of study treatment or 
study discontinuation/termination, whichever is earlier.  
 
• After this period, investigators should only report SAEs that are attributed to prior study 
treatment.  
 
8.3.2.  Assessment of Adverse Events 
• All AEs and SAEs whether volunteered by the subject, discovered by study personnel during questioning, or detected through physical examination, laboratory test, or other means will be reported appropriately.  
 
• Each reported AE or SAE will be described by its duration (i.e.,  start and end dates), 
regulatory seriousness criteria if applicable, suspec ted relationship to the study 
treatment  (see following guidance), and actions taken. 
 
• To ensure consistency of AE and SAE causality assessments, investigators should apply the following general guideline: 
MERIT PROTOCOL VERSI ON 1.8, 20 AUG 2020  Safety reporting of adverse and other events  │ 52 
 
P:\Doc\MUST \MERIT \protocol \1.8_20 08 20 \MERIT protocol 1.8_20 Aug 2020.docx  - Yes 
 There is a plausible temporal relationship between the onset of the AE 
and administration of the study treatment, and the AE cannot be readily 
explained by the subject’s clinical state, intercurrent illness, or 
concomitant therapies  
And/or  
 The AE follows a known pattern of response to the study treatment ; 
and/or the AE abates or resolves upon discontinuation of the study 
treatment  or dose reduction and, if applicable, reappears upon re -
challenge.  
- No 
 Evidence exists that the AE has an etiology other than the study 
treatment  (e.g., preexisting medical condition, underlying disease, 
intercurrent illness, or concomitant medication):  
And/or  
 The AE has no plausible temporal relationship to study treatment 
administration (e.g., cancer diagnosed 2 days after first dose of study 
treatment ). 
 
Expected adverse events are those adverse events  that are listed or characterized in the 
Package Insert or current Investigator Brochure.  
 Unexpected adverse events are those not listed in the Package Insert (P.I.) or current 
Investigator Brochure (I.B.) or not identified. This includes adverse events for which the 
specificity or severity is not consistent with the description in the P.I. or I.B. For example, under 
this definition, hepatic necrosis would be unexpected if the P.I. or I.B. only referred to elevated 
hepatic enzymes or hepatitis.  
 
 
8.4. Procedures for eliciting, recording, and reporting adverse events 
8.4.1.  Overview  
• Eliciting adverse events  
A consistent methodology for eliciting AEs at all subject evaluation time points  should be 
adopted. Examples of non- directive questions include:  
- “How have you felt since your last clinical visit?”  
- “Have you had any new or changed health problems since you were last here?”  
 
• Specific Instructions for Recording Adverse Events  
Investigators should use correct medical terminology/concepts when reporting AEs or S AEs. 
Avoid colloquialisms and abbreviations. 
 
8.4.2.  Diagnosis vs. Signs and Symptoms  
If known at the time of reporting, a diagnosis should be reported rather than individual 
signs and symptoms (e.g., record only liver failure or hepatitis rather than jaundice, 
asterixis, and elevated transaminases). However, if a constellation of signs and/or 
symptoms cannot be medically characterized as a single diagnosis or syndrome at the time of reporting, it is ok to report the information that is currently available. If a diagnosis 
is subsequently established, it should be reported as follow -up information.

P:\Doc\MUST \MERIT \protocol \1.8_20 08 20 \MERIT protocol 1.8_20 Aug 2020.docx  8.4.3.  Deaths 
All deaths that occur during the protocol- specified AE reporting p eriod, regardless of 
attribution, will be reported to the appropriate parties. When recording a death, the event 
or condition that caused or contributed to the fatal outcome should be reported as the 
single medical concept. If the cause of death is unknown and cannot be ascertained at 
the time of reporting, report “Unexplained Death”. 
 
8.4.4.  Preexisting M edical Conditions  
A preexisting medical condition is one that is present at the start of the study. Such 
conditions should be reported as medical and surgical history. A preexisting medical 
condition should be re- assessed throughout the trial and reported as an AE or SAE only 
if the frequency, severity, or character of  the condition worsens during the study. When 
reporting such events, it is important to convey the concept that the preexisting condition has changed by including applicable descriptors (e.g.,  “more frequent headaches”).  
 
8.4.5.  Hospitalizations for Medical or Surgical Procedures 
Any AE that results in hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization should be documented and reported as an SAE. If a subject is hospitalized to undergo a medical or surgical  
procedure as a result of an AE, the event responsible for the procedure, not the procedure itself, should be reported as the SAE. For example, if a subject is hospitalized to undergo coronary bypass surgery, record the heart condition that necessitated the 
bypass as the SAE.  
 
Hospitalizations for the following reasons do not require reporting:  
- Hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization for diagnostic or elective surgical 
procedures for preexisting conditions  
- Hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization required to allow efficacy 
measurement for the study or  
- Hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization for scheduled therapy of the target disease of the study.  
 
8.4.6.  Pregnancy  
If a female subject becomes pregnant while receiving investigational therapy or within 30 days  
after the la st dose of a study treatment, a report should be completed and  expeditiously 
submitted to the Coordinating Center who will submit report to Genentech, Inc.  if study 
treatment is Lucentis . Follow -up to obtain the outcome of the pregnancy should also occur. 
Abortion, whether accidental, therapeutic, or spontaneous, should always be classified as serious, and expeditiously reported as an SAE. Similarly, any congenital anomaly/birth defect in 
a child born to a female  subject exposed to a study treatment  should be reported as an SAE.  
 
8.4.7.  Product complaints  
A product complaint is any written or oral information received from a complainant that alleges 
deficiencies related to identity, quality, safety, strength, purity, reliability, durability, ef fectiveness 
or performance of a product after it has been released and distributed to the commercial market 
or clinical trial.  Clinical centers are required to report product complaints for study treatments to 
the CC on an Unanticpated Event (UA) form  within 7 days of learning of the event .  
 A recent FDA update to the Post Marketing Safety Reporting (PMSR)  regulation requires the 
Marketing Authorization Holder  (MAH ) to report product complaints to the FDA.   Genentech, the

P:\Doc\MUST \MERIT \protocol \1.8_20 08 20 \MERIT protocol 1.8_20 Aug 2020.docx  MAH for ranibizumab (Lucentis), is donating the ranibizumab for U.S. clinical centers for the 
MERIT Trial.   As part of the CC’s agreement with Genentech, the CC will report any  product 
complaints  for ranibizumab reported for the MERIT Trial .  The CC will report complaints to 
Genentech within 15 days  
8.4.8.  Post -Study Adverse Events  
The investigator should expeditiously report any SAE occurring after a subject has completed or discontinued study participation if attributed to prior  exposure to study treatment . If the 
investigator should become aware of the development of cancer or a congenital anomaly in a subsequently conceived offspring of a female subject who participated in the study, this should 
be reported as an SAE . 
  
8.4.9.  Reconciliation  
The Coordinating Center  (the sponsor) agrees to conduct  reconciliation for the product donated 
by Genentech (i.e., Lucentis).  The Coordinating Center  will agree to the reconciliation 
periodicity and format, but agree at minimum to exchange quarterly line listings of cases 
received by the other party. If discrepancies are identified, the Coordinating Center  and 
Genentech will cooperate in resolving the discrepancies. The responsible individuals for each 
party shall handle the matter on a case- by-case basis u ntil satisfactory resolution.  
 
8.4.10.  AEs of Special Interest (AESIs)   
AEs of Special Interest are defined as a potential safety problem, identified as a result of safety monitoring of the Product.  
  
The Lucentis Events of Special Interest are:  
• Retinal pigment epithelial tear  
• Increased intraocular pressure to > 30mm Hg not responsive to maximal topical IOP -

7 Calendar  Day Telephone or Fax Report:  
The Investigator is required to notify the FDA of any fatal or life- threatening adverse event that 
is unexpected and assessed by the investigator to be possibly related to the use of a study 
treatment . An unexpected adverse event is one that is not already described in the study 
treatment  Investigator Brochure. Such reports are to be telephoned or faxed to the FDA and 
Genentech within 7 calendar days of first learning of the event.  
15 Calendar Day Wri tten Report  
The Investigator is also required to notify the FDA and all participating investigators, in a written IND Safety Report, of any serious, unexpected AE that is considered reasonably or possibl y 
related to the use of a study treatment. An unexpected adverse event is one that is not already 
described in the study treatment  investigator brochure.  
 
Written IND Safety reports should include an Analysis of Similar Events in accordance with 
regulation 21 CFR § 312.32. All safety reports previously filed by the investigator with the IND

9. Sample size and statistical methods  
9.1. Sample size, power and detectable differences 
The study is powered to test whether intravitreal methotrexate and ranibizumab are each 
superior to intravitreal dexamethasone in terms of change in central subfield thickness.  A 
Bonferroni correction is used to adjust for the co- primary hypotheses, i.e. a two- sided type I 
error rate of 0.05/2 = 0.025 will be used to determine statistical significance.  The primary 
outcome, reti nal thickness, is measured on the log -scale, which translates to an assessment of 
relative change compared to baseline. The expected percent reduction in retinal thickness from baseline for dexamethasone is 25% ( log [0.75] = -0.2877) ; macular  edema that persists  after 
corticosteroid treatment is expected to be less likely to benefit from additional corticosteroid 
therapy.  We expect the novel treatment arms to produce a reduction of 38% (log [0.62] = -
0.4780).  A sample size of 79 independent eyes per treatment group, i.e. 79 individuals with one 
eye for each individual, will provide 91% power to demonstrate an improvement in the percent 
reduction in retinal thickness from 25% to 38% with a two- sided type I error rate of 0.025. 
Assuming a between- eye correlation of 0.4, 25% bilateral disease, and a 10% loss to follow -up, 
we need to enroll 80 individuals in each treatment arm (240 total), 8 fewer participants per arm than would be required if only one eye was included for individuals with bilateral disease a fter 
adjusting for loss to follow -up. 
We also will compare the percent change in retinal thickness for intravitreal injections of methotrexate and ranibizumab; however, the percent change is expected to be similar for these 
therapies and the study is not powered to detect equivalence.  The calculation presented here is 
meant to demonstrate the type of difference that would be detectable with the sample required 
for the primary hypotheses.  As noted above, we assume that the reference group will have a 
percent reduction of 38% (log [0.62]) with a standard deviation for the change in log- retinal 
thickness of 0.33.  A sample size of 79 independent eyes per treatment group (the equivalent of 
80 individuals per arm assuming 10% loss to follow -up, 25% bilateral disease and between- eye 
correlation of 0.4) provides 80% power to detect a difference between the reference percent change of 38% and a percent change of 46.6% (log [0.534]) with a two- sided type I error rate of 
0.05.  
 
9.2. Statistical methods  
The primary outcome variable is change in log retinal thickness at 12 weeks.  A linear 
regression model fitted with generalized estimating equations132 will be used to compare the 
change in log retinal thickness between each of intravitreal methotrexate and ranibizumab with 
dexamethosone.  The mean structure will include treatment effects, a time indicator for weeks 4, 
8, 12, 16, 20, and 24, and time -by-treatment interaction terms. The interaction term for 12 
weeks represents the difference in change in log retinal thickness from baseline.  An unstructured or Toeplitz covariance matrix will be used to model the longitudinal, within- eye 
repeated measures and the bootstrap will be used to adjust the standard errors to account for 
the between- eye correlation.   Other continuous and binary outcomes will be modeled in a 
similar manner using linear and logistic models, respectively.  In addition, the models will be 
adjusted for the stratification variable used during randomization (presence or absence of 
concomitant systemic corticosteroid and/or immunosuppressive therapy ). 
 Kaplan Meier curves will be plotted to graphically portray the cumulative percent with 
improvement of ME based on OCT central subfield assessment over time for the three treatments.  Cox proportional hazards models taking into account the correlation between eyes

P:\Doc\MUST \MERIT \protocol \1.8_20 08 20 \MERIT protocol 1.8_20 Aug 2020.docx  through a random effect (also known as a frailty model) will be used to compare the time to 
improvement of ME for the three treatment arms.  Additional time- to-event outcomes (e.g. time 
to resolution, failure, and relapse) will be analyzed in a similar manner.  
 
The rates of adverse events will be compared using a Negative Binomial model with a random 
effect for individual.  The overall burden and timing of serious adverse events will be displayed graphically by plotting a single line for each individual highlighting the start and stop dates of 
SAE so rted by the time of first event
133. Robust standard errors will be computed for all analyses 
using statistical program -based approaches or the bootstrap, where the unit of analysis is the 
individual. In addition, the models will be adjusted for the stratification variable used during 
randomization (presence or absence of concomitant systemic corticosteroid and/or immunosuppr essive therapy). All primary analyses will be according to treatment assignment 
(i.e. following the principles of Intention to Treat).  A sensitivity analysis of based upon treatment received will be performed for comparison.  Additional sensitivity analyses will be performed to 
assess the impact of missing data.  These include ‘best’ and ‘worst’ case single imputations as 
well as multiple imputatio n and pattern mixture approaches

10. Efficacy monitoring and stopping guidelines  
 
The guidelines for the interim efficacy analyses were developed by the Data and Safety 
Monitoring Committee (DSMC) and MUST Executive Committee.  Additional unplanned efficacy 
analyses will be done if recommended by the DSMC or MUST Executive Committee.  
A single pre -planned interim efficacy analysis will  be performed once 40 % of participants have 
completed the 12- week visit (the primary outcome time -point).   The type I error for each of the 
co-primary comparisons is 0.025, i.e. half was allocated to each comparison to control the study 
wide type I error rate.   For each comparison, the type I error thresholds would be 0.00016  at the 
interim analysis and 0.02484 at the final analysis to maintain a global 0.025 error rate over the 
course of the trial based upon O’brien -Fleming boundaries.

11. Regulatory and ethical issues  
 
11.1.  Recruitment and informed consent procedures 
Eligible patients will be recruited from the patient populations seen at and referred to the MUST 
Research Group clinical centers located in the U nited States, United Kingdom, Australia, 
Canada, and India.. Typically, patients will be identified in the course of usual clinical practice by 
the study physicians. When a potentially eligible patient is identified, the study physician and study coordinator will describe the study to and discuss the study with the patient. Patients 
considering enrollment will be given the consent statement and, if applicable,  IRB-approved 
informational materials and be allowed time to decide about joining the study. After patients 
have time to review materials and discuss enrollment with family members when appropriate, the clinic coordinator or study physician will obtain written informed consent, using a written, 
local IRB-approved consent document  based on a prototype prepared by the CC and approved 
by the CC’s IRB, the JHSPH IRB Office.  The trial will be registered on www.ClinicalTrials.gov
. 
Recruitment efforts and eligibility criteria for MERIT are subject to review and approval by IRBs 
and the DSMC.  
 
11.2.  IRB/Protection of human subjects  
Potential risks and procedures to minimize risks to participants  
The injection procedures, dosage of medication and treatment algorithm within the study will be consistent with standard clinical treatment, e.g., sterile technique, prophylactic pressure lowering medicine instilled prior to procedure. To minimize risks associated with increased 
ocular pressure post -injection, patients with uncontrolled ocular hypertension or glaucomatous 
changes will be excluded from the trial.  Patients in the trial will not be exposed to risk beyond what they would be exposed to with standard clinical care for their condition. Adverse events 
encountered will be managed by the best medical judgment of the treating physician.  
 Confidentiality  
Confidentiality of patient data will be maintained in accordance with legal regulations. Protected 
health information will be kept in a secure place. Name, social security number, address, and 
other such personal data will be kept solely at the clinical center where the patient receives 
her/his clinical  care. Such information will not be transmitted to the Coordinating Center or to 
other study  sites. A  dataset limited so as to contain a minimal amount of protected health 
information –that required to make the data useful for accomplishing the purposes of the MUST 
Trial– may be disclosed, as needed,  to collaborating study  sites, the NEI, and the FDA, as will be 
stated on a study  privacy  acknowledgment form signed by the participant at the time of 
enrollment. Also included in the  privacy acknowledgment is the statement that representatives 
of NEI, FDA, the Institutional Review  Boards, and Coordinating Center may see identifying 
information while reviewing study records.  This privacy acknowledgment will be designed to 
conform to specifications of HIPAA regulations,  and any other relevant regulations, as approved 
by the local governing authorities invested with oversight of HIPAA reg ulations at each 
participating site. Clinically relevant information from the study may be placed in the patient's 
medical record. Release of protected health information to any  other persons or organizations 
will require additional written consent of the patient affected, except as  required by law.

Inclusion of children  
Patients  under  18 years  of age will not be included as neither ranibizumab nor the 
dexamethasone pellet is approved for pediatric  use. 
 Data and safety monitoring Trial monitoring will be conducted by a study Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC).  
The DSMC  consists mostly of members  of the standing DSMC which monitored the Multicenter 
Uveitis Steroid Treatment (MUST) Trial and now is monitoring the MUST Follow -up Study. The 
Chair of the MUST DSMC, who is a biostatistician, is unable to serve because of potential 
conflicts of interest.  Hence a new member who is an experienced methodologist for ophthalmic studies was  appointed and the Chair of the DSMC for this protocol is  one of th e clinical experts.  
The committee consists of voting members  with expertise in biostatistics, clinical trial design, 
and ophthalmology who were appointed by NEI and non- voting members (i.e., Study Officers).   
 For each DSMC meeting, data will be summarize d by personnel from the CC and presented to 
the DSMC . The DSMC will meet at least  twice a year  (one in- person meeting and one meeting 
by conference call) .  Additional meetings/conference calls may be requested by DSMC Chair 
and/or NEI Project Officer.   Mee ting reports will include information summaries related to 
monitoring the safety and effectiveness of the study treatments as well as study performance including data quality and clinic performance.   Pertinent information from outside sources such 
as a reprint of a recent publication reporting on results of other, related studies will also be included as available.  All reports will include tables and graphs that summarize and formally 
compare baseline and adverse event data by treatment assignment, and if indicated, within 
specific subgroups.  A single interim efficacy analysis formally comparing the treatment groups 
will be performed once 50% of participants have completed the 12- week visit (See Section 10).  
Graphical and/or numeric summaries (without formal statistical comparisons) will be provided in the meeting books that are not associated with the interim efficacy analysis.  Additional efficacy analyses may be performed at the request of the DSMC if necessary .  
 The DSMC Medical Safety Officer , appointed from among the physician voting members of the 
DSMC, will review all SAE reports received by the CC as described in section 5.1.

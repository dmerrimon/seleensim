Duration of participation for a subject  
Subject participation in the study is estimated to last approxi mately 7 weeks and will 
include:  
• Visit 1: A screening period up to 2 weeks 
• Visit 2: A single i.v. injection of the first peptide/radioacti vity dose of 68Ga-OPS202 
on Day 1 followed by PET/CT scan imaging 1 hour post dosing (up  to 80 min)  
• Visit 3: A single i.v. injection of the second peptide/radioact ivity dose of 
68Ga-OPS202 followed by PET/CT scan imaging 1 hour post dosing (u p to 80 min) , 
after a 15- to 21-day time inte rval from the first administrati on (Visit 2) 
• Visit 4: A 2-week follow-up period for evaluation of safety. 
 
Study Design and Subject Allocation 
Assessments  
At the Screening Visit (Visit 1) performed within 2 weeks prior  to the first 68Ga-OPS202 
administration, the investigator will collect all the informati on required to check the 
eligibility of the subject to participate in the study includin g medical and surgical history, 
physical examination, laboratory tests (including haematology, blood chemistry and 
urinalysis) and tumour histopathology. Results from a somatosta tin receptor positive scan 
within 6  months prior to the first 68Ga-OPS202 administration will b e collected and sent to 
the ICL for assessment of quality and admissibility.  
Subjects’ eligibility will be re -checked by the investigator at Baseline/Day 1 (Visit 2) 
before randomisation. If the eligibility is confirmed, the subj ect will be randomly allocated 
to one of the three study arms to receive the first dose of 68Ga-OPS202 with PET/CT 
imaging, then discharged the day after. Intravenous iodinated C T contrast is required and 
will be injected according to the site standard procedure. This  procedure will be repeated 
after 15  to 21 days at Visit 3 (Day 16 to 22) with th e appropriate peptide/radioactivity dose 
range combinations of 68Ga-OPS202 as indicated by the subject’s randomisation. The 
PET/CT scanner must be the same for the two scans per subject a nd for all subjects at the 
same study site. Subjects may be hospitalised overnight at the discretion of the investigator.

For OPS202 PK, blood samples of 2 mL will be collected at the f ollowing timepoints: 
Baseline pre -dose (T0), 5 min, 15 to 45 min, 1h, 2h, 3h and 6h after the 68Ga-OPS202 i.v. 
administration at the corresponding visits (Visit 2 and Visit 3 ). Urine will also be collected 
during the first 6  hours in two separate samples: 0h to 3h and 3h to 6h after the 
68Ga-OPS202 i.v. administration. 
An End of Study Visit (Visit 4) will take place 2 weeks after t he second PET/CT scan, 
during which the investigator will collect the safety informati on required by the study 
protocol (See Criteria of Safety Evaluation below). At the end of Visit 4, the subject’s 
participation in the study will end. For any adverse event (AE)  emerging or worsening 
during the study that persists beyond Visit 4, the investigator  will monitor the subject until 
the AE is resolved or considered stabilized.  
Comparative methods and blinding  
This is an open -label study. Independent readers will evaluate 68Ga-OPS202 PET/CT 
images and will be blinded to the investigator site and clinica l status of the subject, 
including pathology, laboratory, and history/physical exam find ings. Furthermore, the 
independent readers will be blinded to peptide mass dose, radio activity dose, and the 
temporal sequence of dosing.  
Independent readers are specializ ed radiologists and/or nuclear  medicine physicians who 
are experienced in reading 68Ga-radiolabeled agent PET/CT scans. To minimize inter-  and 
intra-reader variability in r esults, the readers will be spe cifically trained for this proto col.

Test product, dose, mode of administration : 
68Ga-OPS202 is a diagnostic medicinal product with 3 main compone nts, namely: 
• 68Ga, a positron emitter radionuclid e with a half-life of 68 min  
• NODAGA, a chemical chelator group, and 
• JR11, an antagonist somatostatin analogue that binds to sst2 re ceptors 
OPS202 (cold kit) is available for clinical trials in a 50  μg peptide mass dose vial and is 
radiolabeled using a 68Ge/68Ga-generator. The radiolabelled OPS202 (68Ga-OPS202) 
consists of 50 μg of peptide in a total volume of 6 mL (8.33  μg/mL).  Sampling of 0.5 mL 
for quality control yields 5.5  mL solution from which the volume to be injecte d into the 
subject is withdrawn. This volume is calculated to obtain the t arget peptide mass dose and 
the desired radioactivity dose.  
The calculation of the volume takes into account the different components that determine 
the final radioactivity dose. The  subject will be exposed to, in particular:  
• The amount of 68Ga eluted from the generator, which depends on the latter’s hal f-life 
• The time elapsed between OPS202 (cold kit) radiolabelling and t he injection of 
68Ga-OPS202 to the subject (decay of 68Ga), the variation of which is a tool to adjust 
the final peptide/radioactivity dose to be injected 
• The required peptide mass dose and radioactivity dose of 68Ga-OPS202 to be 
injected. 
The actual peptide mass dose admi nistered to the subject (injec ted dose) will be estimated 
using the following equation:  
Injected dose (μg) = [Volume injected (mL) / Volume used for 68Ga-OPS202 preparation 
(mL)] x Peptide dosage in the vial (μg) = [Injected Volume/6mL]  x 50μg  
The radioactivity in the syringe is measured immediately before  the administration of 
68Ga-OPS202 to the subject and immediately after; the difference bet w e e n  t h e s e  t w o  
measurements (in MBq) constitutes the radioactivity dose inject ed to the subject.  
68Ga-OPS202 will be administered  twice during the study for each subject by i.v. injection 
over one minute prior to PET/CT s can. The PET/CT scanner settin gs should be the same 
for the two scans per subject and for all subjects at the same study site, as described in the 
Imaging Review Charter (IRC). 
Duration of treatment : 68Ga-OPS202 will be administered i .v. twice: at Baseline/Day 1 
(Visit 2), and at Visit 3, which will be 15 to 21 days after th e first injection.

Reference therapy, dose and mode of administration :  
Comparator compound/placebo : 
In this study, there is no comparison with a placebo or referen ce-imaging product. The 
statistical analyses will describ e the differences between the different combinations of 
peptide mass dose range and radioactivity dose range.  
Other treatments : Any med ication and/or therapy taken or received by the subject during 
the study, other than the study investigational compound (68Ga-OPS202), will be 
considered concomitant medication whether or not it is targetin g the studied GEP -NET. 
Concomitant treatments are to be prescribed, modified, or disco ntinued at the investigator 
discretion.  Subjects must be withdrawn from the study, but fol lowed -up when possible for 
further data collection, if at least one of the protocol -prohibited medications/therapies (see 
above -mentioned eligibility criteria) is received by the subjects duri ng the study period up 
to the end of the second PET/CT scan (at Visit 3).  
Any addition, change, or discontinuation of concomitant medicat ions should be 
documented as defined in the study protocol. 
Criteria for evaluation : 
Efficacy : 
All the primary and secondary imaging endpoints are read by thi rd-party independent 
readers. Most of the reading will be conducted in blinded manne r. Primary and secondary 
endpoints will be measured in key organs: li ver, lymph nodes, bone and lungs. 
Primary Endpoint and Evaluation:  
• For each combination of injected p eptide/radioactivity dose ran ges, differences in 
relative lesion counts derived from a 2 × 3 factorial analysis measuring the ratio of 
the number of lesions detected by 68Ga-OPS202 to the number of lesions assessed 
by standard-of-truth (descriptive analyses). 
The standard -of-truth in the present study is the CT scan images acquired at Vi sit 2 and 
Visit 3.  
Secondary endpoints and evaluations:  
Key secondary endpoint: 
• For each combination of injected p eptide/radioactivity dose ran ges, differences in 
image quality derived from a 2 × 3 factorial analysis measuring  the 
tumour-to- background ratio in each of the major anatomic sites (descripti ve analyses 
for liver, lymph nodes, bone and lungs)  
A qualitative analysis of the image assessed by the independent  blinded readers will be 
performed to back up the quantitative quality measured by tumou r-to-background analysis.  
Other secondary endpoints:  
• Differences in lesion SUV max between the two peptide mass dose ranges and the 
three radioactivity dose ranges measured in the most avid lesio ns (descriptive 
analyses for up to a maximum of five lesions per organ in liver , lymph nodes, bone 
and lungs) 
• Differences of absol ute number of lesions between the two peptide mass dose ranges 
and the three radioactivity dose ranges detected in each of the  following anatomic 
sites:

• Primary site of GEP-NET  
• Lymph nodes  
• Liver  
• Axial/appendicular skeleton  
• Lungs 
The primary and secondary endpoints will also be evaluated on a  radioactivity dose/kg of 
body weight.  
Exploratory endpoints:  
• Preliminary diagnostic sensitivity of 68Ga-OPS202 imaging of GEP- NETs by both 
subject-based and lesion-based analysis compared to standard-of -truth 
• Comparison to sstr2 agonist result s will be computed for sensit ivity analysis 
• Differences in SUV max ratios between the two peptide mass dose ranges and three 
radioactivity dose ranges for lesions 
• SNR calculated from lesion-free volume of interest (VOI) in the liver: 
SUV mean/SUV SD between the three radioactivity doses. 
For further details on efficacy endpoints, refer to the core st udy protocol and IRC.  
Safety : 
The investigator will report the occurrence of any AE throughou t the study, including 
clinically significant abnormalities in laboratory tests (serum  chemistry, haematology, and 
urinalysis), vital signs (blood pressure and heart rate) measur ements, physical examination 
findings and body weight measurements at each visit: Screening Visit (Visit 1), Baseline 
Visit (Visit  2; Day 1), Visit 3 (Day 16 to Day 22), and End of Study/ Early Withdrawal 
Visit (Visit 4; Day  30 to Day 36). The electrocardiogram (ECG) findings are to be r ecorded 
at Screening Visit and End of Study/ Early Withdrawal (Visit 4;  Day 30 to  Day 36). 
Concomitant medications/therapies will also be recorded through out the study.  
The following safety endpoints will be evaluated:  
• Proportion of subjects experiencing at least one AE of any grad e according to 
NCI-CTCAE v5.0), including any SAEs and suspected unexpected serious adverse 
reactions (SUSARs); all AEs will be coded using Medical Diction ary for Regulatory 
Activities (MedDRA) system organ class (SOC) and preferred term  (PT) (as per most 
recent version) 
• Proportion of subjects experiencing at least one AE of grade ≥3 according to 
NCI-CTCAE   
• Clinically significant changes in physical examination, vital s igns, ECG and 
laboratory findings, which will be recorded by the investigator  as AEs. 
Pharmacokinetics:  
• Characterization of the PK of OPS202: 
OPS202 blood and urine PK sampling will be performed for all su bjects participating in 
the study. Blood samples for measurement of OPS202 plasma level s will be collected at 
different time points at Visit 2 and Visit 3 (see Study Design – Assessments section). 
OPS202 plasma concentrations will  be measured using a validated  analytical method. 
Remaining plasma from the PK samples may be used to control the  presence of potential 
major metabolites of OPS202. Urine collection to determine rena l excretion of OPS202

• All the  48 scans will serve for the primary and key secondary 2 × 3 fac torial analysis 
endpoints 
• 24 sets for each of the two peptide mass dose ranges regardless  of the radioactivity 
dose which will be analysed to describe the difference between these two dose ranges 
• 16 sets for each radioactivity dose range regardless of peptide  mass dose, which will 
be analysed to describe the diff erences between these three dos e ranges. 
The analysis will be descriptive and no formal statistical test s are planned for the primary 
and secondary endpoints. Mea n, standard deviation, median and r anges will be estimated. 
The primary endpoint and secondary tumour -to-background ratio and SUV max endpoints’ 
analyses will be performed following the 2 × 3  factorial distribution of the imaging sets per 
combination of peptide/radioactivity dose ranges.  
Overall differences among the three radioactivity doses, overal l difference among the two 
peptide mass doses, and interaction between the peptide mass do ses and radioactivity doses 
will be analysed.  
Interim Analysis  
An interim analysis will be performed when a minimum of 12 subj ects have fully completed 
the study. The study will continue while the interim analysis i s performed and the study 
may be stopped per sponsor’s decision based on expert review of the data. The inte rim 
statistical analysis plan wil l provide further details of the s tatistical analyses.

1 BACKGROUND INFORMATION 
1.1 Introduction 
Neuroendocrine tumours are rare neoplasms [ 1, 2] with more than 50% of cases originating in 
the gastrointestinal (GI) system or pancreas [ 1]. Gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine 
tumours (GEP-NETs) constitute a heterogeneous group of tumours with their origin in 
neuroendocrine cells of the embryological gut. Most commonly, t he primary lesion is located 
in the gastric mucosa, the small and large intestine, the rectu m or pancreas. The crude incidence 
has notably increased over the last decade and is estimated to be 5.25/100 000/year. The 
prevalence has recently been calculated to 35/100 000/year [ 3]. Importantly, approximately 
80% of newly diagnosed patients present with metastasis, requir ing an effective systemic 
treatment to prolong survival. The 5-year survival rate for thi s population is approximately 40% 
[4]. The latest World Health Organization (WHO) classification pr esented in 2010 defines the 
entire group of tumours as neuroendocrine neoplasms and divides  the tumours into well 
differentiated NET G1, NET G2 and poorly differentiated neuroen docrine carcinoma (NEC G3) 
[5]. 
Most GEP-NETs overexpress somatostatin receptors (sstr), locate d on their cell surfaces [ 6]. 
To date a family of five different G protein-coupled sstr has b een defined (sstr1 –sstr5). The five 
subtypes share approximately half of the amino acid sequence, a nd have been shown to display 
different tumour tissue expression levels and biological functi ons.  sstr2 is the most commonly 
expressed sstr in GEP-NETs (80-90%) [ 7].  
The high expression level of sstr2 across the majority of tumou rs has led to the recommendation 
that for the clinical management , the initial disease staging s hould, whenever possible, include 
sstr scintigraphy which can nowadays be replaced by 68Gallium-labelled agent positron 
emission tomography (PET) with very high spatial resolution and  quantification. PET is 
recommended to be complemented with computed tomography (CT) or  magnetic resonance 
imaging (MRI) depending on the tumour location [ 3].  
Somatostatin-based radiolabeled agonistic peptides have been su ccessfully introduced into the 
clinic for targeted imaging of sstr-positive NETs, especially o f the clinically most relevant 
subtype sstr2. Currently three somatostatin-based radiolabeled peptide analogues are approved 
(or in Regulatory Authority review) in the US and/or Europe: na mely, 111In pentetreotide 
(Octreoscan™), which is based on gamma rays, visualizing sstr -positive tumours in whole body 
single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) [ 8]; 68Ga-DOTA-TATE  
(NETSPOT®) and 68Ga-DOTA-TOC (Somakit-TOC) used with PET imaging that provides 
several advantages over SPECT s uch as temporal and spatial reso lution, reduced radiation 
burden and diminished examination time [ 9, 10]. In addition, on site cyclotron technology is 
not required for 68Gallium-labelled agents. 
OPS202 is a new generation somatostatin analogue (antagonist) c ompound with potential 
superior tumour detection as a c onsequence of the availability of more binding sites, both active 
and inactive sstr2. It consists of t he small somatostatin analo gue JR11 conjugated to the strong 
cyclical chelating agent 1,4,7-triazacyclononane,1-glutaric aci d-4,7-acetic acid (NODAGA), 
which is radiolabelled with the radioactive isotope 68Gallium to produce 68Ga-OPS202. This 
complex (68Ga-OPS202) is being developed as a PET imaging agent for the de tection of 
GEP-NETs in patients. 
68Gallium is a short-lived (half-life 68 min) positron-emitting i sotope generated from decay of 
the parent isotope 68Germanium (half-life: 271 days). In the clinic, it can be creat ed using a 
68Ga-generator. One of the main advantages of 68Ga is its cyclotron-independent availability, 
IPSEN GROUP D-FR-01070-002

Six out of 12 subjects (50.0%) experienced 11 adverse events (A Es), all of which were assessed 
by the investigator as being nonserious. Most of the AEs were m ild in intensity and were 
considered by the investigator as unlikely or not related to th e Investigational Imaging Product 
(IIP). Three AEs in two subjects were assessed as possibly rela ted to 68Ga-OPS202: 
eosinophilia, rash and diarrhoea.  The most frequently reported AEs were urinary tract infection 
(n=2) and fatigue (n=2); these AEs were considered unlikely or not related to the IIP. 
The study also showed promising preliminary efficacy results, w ith the most frequently 
identified lesions being malignant lesions in the liver. In all  scans (somatostatin receptor 1-hour 
scan performed within 6 months before start of the study [pre-b aseline] and the two 
68Ga-OPS202 dose 1-hour scans), malignant liver lesions were dete cted in nine subjects. 
Malignant lymph node lesions were identified in seven subjects in the pre-baseline somatostatin 
receptor 1-hour scan and eight subjects in the 68Ga-OPS202 1-hour scans. 
The detection rate of malignant lesions considering all organs/ tissues (total) was significantly 
higher in the 68Ga-OPS202 1-hour scans than in the pre-baseline somatostatin re ceptor 1-hour 
scan (p≤0.016). This was based on the significantly higher numb er of liver lesions detected in 
the 68Ga-OPS202 1-hour scans compared to the somatostatin receptor 1- hour scan (p≤0.012). 
No significant difference was seen between the pre-baseline som atostatin receptor 1-hour scan 
and the 68Ga-OPS202 1-hour scans with regard to the detection rate of mal ignant lymph node 
lesions. 
1.2 Rationale to Conduct the Trial 
The potential higher diagnostic accuracy of 68Ga-OPS202 (satoreotide trizoxetan) PET/CT 
compared to pre-baseline somatostatin receptor scan warrants th e progression of the compound 
into a phase II study to confirm the optimal dose, particularly  as the analysis of the safety data 
of Study OPS-B-001 did not raise any concern. 
The present dose-confirmation phase II study aims to define the  optimal dose range for peptide 
mass and radioactivity based on detected number of lesions and tumour-to-background ratio in 
subjects with sstr2-positive GEP-NET. The study will also expan d the evaluation of 
68Ga-OPS202 safety. 
1.3 Population to Be Studied 
The study will enrol adult subjects with sstr2-positive GEP-NET . 
1.4 Peptide Mass Dose Rationale 
In order to study the influence of specific activity (defined a s radioactivity over peptide mass) 
on PET/CT image quality in the phase I/II clinical trial, two d ifferent peptide doses of 15 ± 5 μg 
and 50 ± 15 μg OPS202 (with 68Ga activity of 125 to 195 MBq) were administered to the same 
patient at the first and the second visit, respectively, allowi ng intra-patient comparison and 
resulting in a range of specific activity of 3 to 13 MBq/μg. In  the proposed phase II study, the 
peptide ranges are designed to cover the lowest achievable pept ide dose (5 μg to 20 μg; close 
to the 15 ± 5 μg of the phase I/II) and the upper range, within  the capability of the kit (30 μg to 
45 μg; close to the 50 ±15 μg of the phase I/II).  
The internationally recognized procedure guidelines for PET/CT tumour imaging with 
68Ga-DOTA-conjugated peptides: 68Ga-DOTATOC, 68Ga-DOTANOC and 68Ga-DOTATATE, 
published by the European Assoc iation of Nuclear Medicine (EANM ), which are based on the 
clinical experience with the known 68Ga-labeled somatostatin receptor agonists, proposes use 
of less than 50 μg of (injected) peptide as this amount would b e expected not to have 
clinically-significant pharmacological effect [ 12]. The present OPS202 kit- formulation is 50 μg 
IPSEN GROUP D-FR-01070-002 
 C O N F I D E N T I A L   PROTOCOL: VERSION 5.0, AMENDMENT 3.0: 20 MAY 2019 PAGE 26/125 
 
 
to ensure reliable radiolabeling with a 68Ga radionuclide incorporation greater than 97%; the 
upper recommended limit of 50 μg was selected to compensate for  the presence of potential 
metal contaminants (potential breakthrough of the parent radion uclide is possible [ 13] from the 
68Ge/68Ga generator elution and to provide a margin for robust radiola beling. In the formulation 
given to patients, approximately 0.01-0.04% of OPS202 is comple xed to 68Ga, whereas the 
remaining is unlabelled. 
The OPS202 kit supplied to the investigator sites will have a t otal of 50 μg of peptide to be 
made up into a 6 mL solution with 68Ga. A minimum of 0.5 mL or 4.2 μg of peptide will need 
to be withdrawn for quality control, leaving 5.5 mL or 45 μg of peptide available for injection. 
Based on this information, two peptide dose ranges were selecte d to be further evaluated in the 
phase II study: 5 μg to 20 μg and 30 μg to 45 μg, the latter va lue being the highest achievable 
from a 50 μg kit do se, as described above, and the lower dose is the lowest achiev able that 
allows to adhere to the “as low as reasonably achievable” (ALAR A) principle.  
It is anticipated that a range of injected peptide mass doses p rovides greater flexibility for 
radioactivity dosing. It is of note that this flexibility is im portant in clinical practice since the 
radioactivity dose is influenced by the age of the gallium gene rator. Other factors like PET 
scanner characteristics and subject’s body mass index (BMI) hav e to be a ccommodated by the 
flexibility in radioactivity dosing. 
1.5 Radioactivity Dose Rationale 
Three radioactivity dose ranges are proposed: 
• 40 - 80 MBq 
• 100-140 MBq 
• 160-200 MBq 
This phase II study will evaluate the radioactivity dose across  a range that will be in the same 
order as the earlier phase I/II study with lower radioactivity doses also being evaluated to adhere 
to the ALARA principle. It is anticipated that to obtain good q uality images with 68Ga-OPS202 
across a range of subject BMI and PET scanners, a radioactivity  dose in the range of 100 MBq 
to 200 MBq will be required. To adhere to the ALARA principle a nd to identify a “near optimal 
dose” this phase II study will also evaluate a lower radioactiv ity dose range (40 -80 MBq). It is 
anticipated that the lower radioactivity dose will be near opti mal or below optimal for some 
subjects, particularly those who have a high BMI. 
Therefore, the aim of this phase II study is to demonstrate tha t over the range of injected 
radioactivity dose of 100 MBq to 200 MBq there is a clear diagn ostic signal, regardless of the 
injected peptide dose used. One can consider the peptide as the  “68Ga-carrier” that targets sstr2 
receptors, and hence the peptide dose within the micro-dosing r ange selected should not be a 
factor in diagnostic efficacy, but adjusted to ensure optimal r adioactivity dose reaches the target 
lesions.

2 PURPOSE OF THE STUDY AND STUDY OBJECTIVES 
2.1 Purpose of the Study 
OPS202, an sstr2 antagonist compound, has demonstrated improved  receptor binding, due to 
its capacity to bind both active and inactive sstr2, relative t o sstr2 agonists. Therefore, the 
radiolabelled OPS202 potentially has an improved diagnostic per formance as a PET imaging 
agent compared to ssrt2 agonists. Initial safety data have not raised any concerns. While the 
initial studies demonstrated good diagnostic performance in a s ingle centre setting, the 
requirement to confirm both the peptide and radioactivity dose ranges in a multicentre setting 
was stipulated by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  T his study will therefore be 
conducted to evaluate the optimal combination of peptide mass d ose and radioactivity dose 
ranges to provide optimal diagnostic efficacy of 68Ga-OPS202 for PET imaging in subjects with 
GEP-NET.  
2.2 Study Objectives 
The primary objective of the study is: 
• To define the optimal dose range for peptide mass and radioacti vity of 68Ga-OPS202 
based on detected lesions in adult subjects with sstr2-positive  GEP-NET. 
The secondary objectives of the study are as follows: • To further refine the optimal dose range for peptide mass and r adioactivity based on 
quantitative maximum standardised uptake value (SUV
max) and other image quality 
parameters  
• To describe the safety and tolerability of diagnostic 68Ga-OPS202 in subjects with 
sstr2-positive GEP-NET 
• To characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) of OPS202 in subjects  with GEP-NET. 
The exploratory objective of the study is: • To provide preliminary estimates of the sensitivity of 
68Ga-OPS202 PET/CT scan 
imaging, as well as SUV ratio (SUV max lesion/ SUV mean reference tissue), signal-to-noise 
ratios (SNR).

Subject participation in the study is estimated to last approxi mately 7 weeks and will include: 
• Visit 1: A screening period up to 2 weeks 
• Visit 2: A single intravenous (i.v.) injection of the first pep tide/radioactivity dose of 
68Ga-OPS202 on Day 1 followed by PET/CT scan imaging 1 hour post dosing (up to 80 
min)  
• Visit 3: A single i.v. injection of the second peptide/radioact ivity dose of  68Ga-OPS202 
followed by PET/CT scan imaging 1 hour post dosing (up to 80 min) . This visit is 
scheduled 15 to 21days after the first 68Ga-OPS202 administration (Visit 2) 
• Visit 4: A 2-week follow-up period for evaluation of safety.  
Screening Procedures (Visit 1) 
During the Screening period (Visit 1) the investigator will sel ect the candidate subjects and 
invite them to take part in the study. He or she will explain t he study as indicated in Section 13.2 
and obtain written informed consent before conducting any study  procedure. 
Randomisation and IIP Administration (Visit 2 and 3) At Visit 2, eligible subjects will be randomised to one of the three study arms, to receive a single 
i.v. injection of 
68Ga-OPS202 with a peptide mass dose range of 5-20 μg and one of the 
radioactivity dose ranges (40-80 MBq, 100-140 MBq and 160-200 M Bq activity of 68Ga). After 
a time interval of 15 to 21 days (Visit 3), another single i.v.  injection of 68Ga-OPS202 will be 
administered to the subject with a peptide mass dose range of 3 0-45 μg and one of the 
radioactivity dose ranges (40-80 MBq, 100-140 MBq and 160-200 M Bq activity of 68Ga) 
according to the study scheme ( Figure 1 ). Specific details of the dosage arms are given in 
Section 6.  
Post Baseline Procedures (Visit 4) Subjects who complete Visit 2 (first PET/CT scan) and Visit 3 ( second PET/CT scan) will be 
considered to have completed the study for efficacy analysis.  
Subjects who complete the study will have final procedures and assessments performed at the 
End of Study/Early Withdrawal Visit (Visit 4). Subjects who wit hdraw from the study before 
the completion of the second PET/CT scan evaluation will have V isit 4 (End of Study/Early 
Withdrawal Visit [Visit 4]) or early termination procedures and  assessments performed at their 
final visit. An End of Study/Early Withdrawal Visit (Visit 4) w ill take place 2 weeks after the 
second PET/CT scan. 
3.2 Primary and Secondary Endpoints and Evaluations 
All the primary and secondary imaging endpoints are read by thi rd party independent readers. 
Most of the reading will be conducted in a blinded manner. 
3.2.1 Primary Efficacy Endpoint and Evaluation 
• For each combination of injected peptide/radioactivity dose ran ge, differences in relative 
lesion counts derived from a 2 × 3 factorial analysis measuring  the ratio of the number 
of lesions detected by 
68Ga-OPS202 to the number of lesions assessed by standard-of-
truth (descriptive analyses). 
The standard-of-truth in this study is the CT scan images acqui red at Visit 2 and Visit 3. 
3.2.2 Secondary Efficacy Endpoints and Evaluations

A qualitative analysis of the image assessed by the independent  blinded readers will be 
performed to back up the quantitative quality measured by tumou r-to-background analysis. 
Other Secondary Endpoints: • Differences in lesion SUV
max between the two peptide mass dose ranges and the three 
radioactivity dose ranges measured in the most avid lesions (de scriptive analyses for up 
to a maximum of five lesions per organ in liver, lymph nodes, b one and lungs) 
• Differences of absolute number of lesions between the two pepti de mass dose ranges and 
the three radioactivity dose ranges detected in each of the fol lowing anatomic sites:  
- Primary site of GEP-NET  
- Lymph nodes  
- Liver  
- Axial/appendicular skeleton  
- Lungs 
• The primary and secondary endpoints will also be evaluated on a  radioactivity dose/kg 
of body weight.  
Exploratory Endpoints: 
• Preliminary diagnostic sensitivity of 68Ga-OPS202 imaging of GEP-NETs by both 
subject-based and lesion-based analysis compared to standard-of -truth 
• Comparison to sstr2 agonist result s will be computed for sensit ivity analysis 
• Differences in SUV max ratios between the two peptide mass dose ranges and three 
radioactivity dose ranges for lesions  
• SNR calculated from lesion-free volume of interest (VOI) in the  liver: SUV mean/SUV SD 
between the three radioactivity doses. 
3.2.3 Safety Endpoints and Evaluations 
The safety and tolerability of 68Ga-OPS202 will be assessed throughout the study by evaluating 
AEs, clinical laboratory test results (serum chemistry, haemato logy, and urinalysis), vital signs 
measurements (blood pressure, heart rate and respiratory rate),  electrocardiograms (ECGs), 
physical examination results a nd concomitant medication usage. 
The following safety endpoints will be evaluated: • Proportion of subjects experiencing at least one AE of any grad e according to National 
Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE 
version 5.0), including any serious adverse events (SAEs) and s uspected unexpected 
serious adverse reactions (SUSARs) 
• Proportion of subjects experiencing at least one AE of grade ≥3  according to 
NCI-CTCAE (version 5.0). All AEs will be coded using Medical Di ctionary for 
Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) system organ class (SOC) and pre ferred term (PT) (as 
per most recent version) 
• Clinically significant changes in physical examination, vital s igns, ECG and laboratory 
findings, which will be recorded by the investigator as AEs.

3.2.4 Pharmacokinetic Endpoints 
OPS202 plasma concentration will be evaluated at the following timepoints: Baseline pre-dose 
(T0), 5 min, 15 to 45 min, 1h, 2h, 3h and 6h after the 68Ga-OPS202 i.v. administration at the 
corresponding visits (Visit 2 and Visit 3). Urine collection to  determine renal excretion of 
OPS202 will be performed over the first 6 hours in two separate  samples: 0h to 3h and 3h to 6h 
after the 68Ga-OPS202 i.v. administration at the corresponding visits (Visi t 2 and Visit 3). 
OPS202 PK parameters include the following: • Maximum plasma concentration (C
max) 
• Area under the plasma concentration time curve from time 0 to t he time of the last 
quantifiable concentration (AUC last) 
• Area under the plasma concentra tion time curve extrapolated to infinity (AUC 0-∞) 
• Elimination half-life (T 1/2) 
• Total plasma clearance (CL) 
• Volume of distribution (V) 
• Excreted amount of OPS202 in the urine over each time interval (see Section 3.2.4 ) as 
well as the 6-hour cumulative amount of unchanged OPS202 excret ed into the urine (Ae). 
3.3 Randomisation and Blinding 
This is an open-label study and there is no blinding for the ad ministration of the IIP nor for its 
doses (peptide mass dose as well as radioactivity dose).  
An independent statistician (t he sponsor’s randomisation manager) will prepare the master lis t 
of randomisation numbers for this study. This list will be prod uced in blocks, on a balance ratio 
for the three sequences summarized in Table 4 . 
Table 4 S equences of Peptide Mass Doses and Radioactivity Doses   
 Visit 2 (D1) Visit 3 (between D16-D22) 
Sequence A 5-20μg / 40-80 MBq 30-45μg / 100-140 MBq 
Sequence B 5-20μg / 100-140 MBq 30-45μg / 160-200 MBq 
Sequence C 5-20μg / 160-200 MBq 30-45μg / 40-80 MBq 
 
After eligibility is confirmed at Visit 2 (Day 1), subjects wil l be assigned to a randomisation 
number and to the associated seque nce of study arm, in sequenti al order within each centre. 
Each subject will receive, at Visit 2 and Visit 3, the peptide mass dose and radioactivity dose 
associated to this randomisation number. The randomisation numb er and the dose ranges will 
be provided by the electronic case report form (eCRF), which wi ll assign the subjects in a study 
arm according to the predefined randomisation list. The investi gator will under no 
circumstances be able to change the randomisation number and th e sequence of treatment arms 
allocated to the subject.  
Recruitment will stop once 24 evaluable subjects have been rand omised and completed the 
study procedures. Each non-evaluable subject (see Section 3.6) will be replaced by a subject 
who will receive the same dose ranges sequence as the one assig ned to the replaced subject. In 
this context, a mirror randomisation list will also be produced  to randomise the replacement 
subjects. In this mirror randomisation list, only the replaceme nt randomisation numbers of 
non-evaluable subjects will be considered.

 C O N F I D E N T I A L   PROTOCOL: VERSION 5.0, AMENDMENT 3.0: 20 MAY 2019 PAGE 33/125 
 
 
The IIP packs and all vials will be labelled. Each label will b e designed in accordance with 
Appendix 13 of the European Union Good Manufacturing Practices (EU-GMP) (see Appendix 
1) and in accordance with specific local requirements if any. Af ter reconstitution and 
radiolabelling the vial will be included in a lead container. T his lead container will be labelled 
according to Appendix 13 of EU GMPs (see Appendix 1 ) and according to specific local 
requirements if any.   
Final IIP reconstitution, radiolabelling, quality control (QC) and IIP release will be performed 
at the study site’s radiopharmacy facility. Labels for the fina l IIP and containers can be provided 
by the sponsor if required by the clinical site. 
The IIP (OPS202, cold precursor) will be packaged and delivered  to the investigational 
sites/central or interim storage  facilities. A sufficient quant ity of IIP will be supplied as well as 
an acknowledgement of receipt form. No code break envelopes wil l be supplied as the double 
blinding relates to the independent central readers.  
The investigator, or designee, will only administer IIPs to sub jects included in this study. Each 
subject will only be given the IIP carrying his/her number. The  dispensing by the responsible 
pharmacist and the administrat ion to each subject will be docum ented in the eCRF. 
The peptide mass dose ranges and the radioactivity dose ranges are summarized in Table 3 , and 
their sequence of administration in Figure 1 . 
3.5 Study Duration 
This study will consist of up to a 2-week screening period, an approximately 3-week imaging 
period, and a 2-week follow-up period. Subjects are expected to  participate in this study for a 
minimum of 6 weeks and up to 7 weeks.  
The subject’s participation in the study will be  considered to have ended at the time of the last 
visit (Visit 4 or End of Study/Early Withdrawal Visit), which s hould occur approximately 
2 weeks after their last IIP administration.  
3.6 Stopping Rules and Discontinuation Criteria 
There are no formal rules for early termination of this study. During the conduct of the study, 
SAEs will be reviewed (see Section 8.1.3 ) as they are reported from the study centres to identify 
safety concerns. The study may be terminated by the sponsor at any time. 
A subject may discontinue participation in the study at any tim e for any reason (e.g., withdrawal 
of consent, AE). The investigator and/or sponsor can withdraw a  subject from the study at any 
time for any reason (e.g., protocol deviation as defined in Sec tion 12.1.2 , noncompliance with 
the protocol conditions or AE). 
If a subject’s Visit 2 68Ga-OPS202 PET/CT scan images are non-evaluable for whatever rea son, 
the subject will be discontinued from the study. This study has  a small number of subjects 
requiring two timepoints for image evaluation.   
Each non-evaluable subject will be replaced by a subject who wi ll receive the same IIP sequence 
as the one assigned to the replaced subject (see Section 3.3). A non-evaluable subject is one for 
whom any of the following image sets are missing or of unaccept able quality for ICL: 
1) Visit 2 and/or Visit 3 68Ga-OPS202 PET/CT scans, as these provide the 
“standard -of-truth” information and both are needed for the factoria l design 
2) Previous somatostatin receptor scans, which confirm the presenc e of sstr2 in the tumour 
IPSEN GROUP D-FR-01070-002 
 C O N F I D E N T I A L   PROTOCOL: VERSION 5.0, AMENDMENT 3.0: 20 MAY 2019 PAGE 34/125 
 
 
3) All images will be reviewed and assessed by ICL to ensure there  are no quality issues 
relating to artefacts that are detrimental to the study endpoin ts.  These primarily consist 
of the following: 
(a) Metal implants 
(b) Patient motion 
(c) Excessive breathing artefacts b etween the PET and CT scan image s. 
  
3.7 Investigational Imaging Product Preparation, Storage and Accoun tability 
3.7.1 Investigational Imaging Produ ct Storage and Security 
The investigator, or an approved representative (e.g., pharmaci st), will ensure that all IIP and 
any other study related material is stored in a secured area, u nder recommended temperature 
monitored storage conditions, in accordance with applicable reg ulatory requirements. 
3.7.2 Investigational Imaging Product Preparation 
The investigator, or an approved representative (e.g., pharmaci st), will ensure that all IIP is 
reconstituted, radiolabelled and dispensed by qualified staff m embers in order to be 
administered to the subject. 
3.7.3 Investigational Imaging Product Accountability 
All IIP and any other study related material is to be accounted  for on the IIP accountability log 
provided by the sponsor. It is essential that all used and unus ed supplies are retained for 
verification (by the sponsor or sponsor’s representative ). The investigator should ensure 
adequate records are maintaine d in the IIP accountability log.  
The destruction of used and unused study treatment should be ca rried out only after any 
discrepancies have been investigated and satisfactorily explain ed and the reconciliation has 
been accepted. The study treatment will be destroyed on site. 
3.8 Maintenance of Randomisation and Blinding 
This is an open-label study; there is no blinding for the imagi ng product used nor for its doses 
(peptide mas dose as well as radioactivity dose). The scan imag es collected at Visit 2 and Visit 
3 are to be read centrally in a blinded manner. 
The images will be sent to a central imaging core lab ICL.  The  ICL will ensure that the 
68Ga-OPS202 and CT images are initially presented to the readers in a blinded manner and 
randomised to temporal sequence. Blinding includes subject ID, site, type of scanner(s), peptide 
mass dose and radiation dose (and therefore visit number). Full  details of this complex read will 
be provided in the Imaging Review Charter (IRC). 
3.9 Source Data Recorded on the Case Report Form 
Data will be collected in the eCRF in compliance with FDA 21 Co de of Federal Regulations 
(CFR) Part 11. As required by Good Clinical Practice (GCP), the  sponsor assigned monitor will 
verify, by direct reference to the source documents, that the d ata required by the protocol are 
accurately reported on the eCRF.  
The source documents must, as a minimum, contain a statement th at the subject is included in 
a clinical study, the date that informed consent was obtained p rior to participation in the study, 
the identity of the study, diagnosis and eligibility criteria, visit dates (with subject status), IIP 
administration, and any AEs and asso ciated concomitant medicati on.

 C O N F I D E N T I A L   PROTOCOL: VERSION 5.0, AMENDMENT 3.0: 20 MAY 2019 PAGE 35/125 
 
 
As required by International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH G CP) Section 6.4.9, if some 
items are recorded directly on the eCRF and are considered as s ource data, the identification of 
these data must be documented a nd agreed between the investigat or and the sponsor. 
Definition for source data and sourc e documents are given below : 
• Source Data : All original records and certified copies of original records  of clinical 
findings, observations, or other activities necessary for the r econstruction and evaluation 
of the study. Source data are contained in source documents (or iginal records or certified 
copies). 
• Source Documents : Original documents, data and records (e.g. hospital records, clinical 
and office charts, laboratory note s, memoranda, subjects’ diaries or evaluation checklists, 
pharmacy dispensing records, recorded data from automated instr uments, copies or 
transcriptions certified after verification as being accurate c opies, microfiches, 
photographic negatives, microfilm or magnetic media, x rays, su bject files, and records 
kept at the pharmacy, at the laboratories and at medicotechnica l departments involved in 
the clinical study). The results of the independent central rea d are also considered source 
documents. 
The subjec t must have consented to their medical records being viewed by the sponsor’s 
authorised personnel, and by local, and possibly foreign, compe tent authorities (CAs). This 
information is included in the informed consent.

4.3 Subject Withdrawal Criteria and Procedures 
In accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki (in accordance w ith the applicable country’s 
acceptance), each subject is free to withdraw from the study at  any time. The investigator also 
has the right to withdraw a subject from the study in the event  of concurrent illness, AEs, or 
other reasons concerning the health or wellbeing of the subject , or in the case of lack of 
cooperation. Any subject who becomes pregnant during the course  of the study will be 
withdrawn (see Sections 8.1.4 and 8.2.4 ). In addition, a subject may be withdrawn from the 
study as described in Sections 3.6, 5.2.4.1 , 6.2 and 8.1.6 .  
Should a subject decide to withdraw from the study after admini stration of IIP, or should the 
investigator decide to withdraw the subject, all efforts will b e made to complete and report the 
observations up to the time of withdrawal as thoroughly as poss ible. A complete final evaluation 
at the time of the subject’s withdrawal should be made (see Sec tion 5.2.4.1 ) and an explanation 
given of why the subject is withdrawing or being withdrawn from  the study. 
The reason for and date of withdrawal from the study must be re corded on the eCRF. If a subject 
withdraws consent, every attempt will be made to determine the reason. If the reason for 
withdrawal is an AE or a clinically significant laboratory test  abnormality, monitoring will 
continue until the event has resolved or stabilised, until the subject is referred to the care of a 
local health care professional, or until a determination of a c ause unrelated to the IIP or study 
procedure is made. The specific AE or test result(s) must be re corded on the eCRF. All 
evaluations should be performed, according to the protocol, on the last day the subject receives 
IIP, or as soon as possible thereafter.

5.2 Study Visits 
5.2.1 Procedures for Screening and Enrolment (Visit 1) 
A signed and dated informed consent form will be obtained befor e screening procedures begin. 
Evaluations obtained as part of routine medical care and perfor med during the screening period 
may be used in place of the study-specific evaluations. Subject s will be asked to acknowledge 
and agree to the possible use of this information for the study  by giving informed consent. 
After informed consent is obtained, subjects who are screened w ill be allocated a subject 
number. All screened subjects must be identifiable throughout t he study. The investigator will 
maintain a list of subject numbers and names to enable records to be found at a later date if 
required. 
The Screening visit (Visit 1) will take place within the 2-week  period prior to randomisation. 
The following assessments will be performed: 
• Eligibility check (inclusion/exclusion criteria) 
• Demographic data (date of birth/age, sex and race/ethnicity wil l be collected according 
to individual country regulations/requirements). The collection  of these data is needed to 
establish whether or not there are potentially clinically impor tant sex- and 
racial/ethnic-based differences i n the anticipated effects of t he studied product. 
• Medical history, including ongoing medical history 
• Physical examination

completed. In the event that the subject did not receive IIP, t he primary reason will be recorded. 
5.2.2 Procedures Before Study IIP administration (Baseline/Visit 2 and Visit 3 Predose) 
The following procedures will be performed at Baseline/Day 1 (V isit 2) and at Day 16-22 
(Visit 3) of the study, prior t o the administration of IIP and information recorded (pre-dosing): 
• Eligibility confirmation, which applies that any test results n eeded for this check should 
be already available (some exams/tests may be repeated if not a vailable from the

6 DIAGNOSTIC IMAGING OF SUBJECTS 
6.1 Study Imaging Product  
6.1.1 68Ga-OPS202 
At Screening, subjects will be a llocated a subject number. Foll owing confirmation of eligibility 
for the study, subjects will be randomised to one of the follow ing sequence of 68Ga-OPS202 
peptide mass dose/ radioactivity dose ranges: 
• Arm A: 5-20 μg/ 40-80 MBq at Visit 2 and 30-45 μg/ 100-140 MBq at Visit 3 
or  
• Arm B: 5-20 μg/ 100-140 MBq at Visit 2 and 30-45 μg/ 160-200 MB q at Visit 3 
or 
• Arm C: 5-20 μg/ 160-200 MBq at Visit 2 and 30-45 μg/ 40-80 MBq at Visit 3 
68Ga-OPS202 is a diagnostic med icinal product with three main com ponents, namely: 
• 68Ga, a positron emitter radionuclid e with a half-life of 68 min  
• NODAGA, a chemical chelator group, and 
• JR11, an antagonist somatostatin a nalogue that binds to sst2 re ceptors 
OPS202 (cold kit) is available for clinical trials in a 50 μg p eptide dose vial, and is radiolabeled 
using a 68Ge/ 68Ga-generator. Due to the short half-life (68 min) of the 68Ga radioisotope, on-site 
generation of 68Ga-labeled radiopharmaceuticals is mandatory. The 68Ga is eluted initially from 
the generator with hydrochloric acid and the eluate combined wi th the reconstituted peptide kit 
preparation. The radiolabelling occurs at room temperature. The  product then undergoes 
radiopharmaceutical quality control  (see Preparation, Radiolabeling and QC manual).  
The radiolabelled OPS202 (68Ga-OPS202) consists of 50 μg of peptide in a total volume of 
6 mL (8.33 μg/mL).  Sampling of 0.5 mL for QC yields 5.5 mL sol ution from which the volume 
to be administered is withdrawn. This volume to be injected is calculated to obtain the target 
peptide mass dose and the desired radioactivity dose. 
The calculation of the volume takes into account the different components that determine the 
final radioactivity dose, the subject will be exposed to, in pa rticular:  
• The amount of 68Ga eluted from the generator whi ch depends on the latter half-l ife  
• The time elapsed between OPS202 (c old kit) radiolabelling and t he injection of 
68Ga-OPS202 to the subject (decay of 68Ga), the variation of which is a tool to adjust the 
final peptide/radioactivity dose required to be injected 
• The required peptide mass dose and radioactivity dose of 68Ga-OPS202 to be injected. 
The actual peptide mass dose administered to the subject (injec ted dose) will be estimated using 
the following equation: 
Injected dose ( μg) = [Volume injected (mL) / Volume used for 68Ga-OPS202 preparation (mL)] 
x Peptide dosage in the vial ( μg) = [Injected Volume/6mL] x 50 μg  
The radioactivity in the syringe is measured immediately before  the injection of 68Ga-OPS202 
to the subject and immediately after; the difference between th ese two measurements (in MBq) 
constitutes the radioactivity dose injected to subject. 
68Ga-OPS202 will be administered t wice during the study for each subject by i.v. injection over 
one minute. After injection is completed, any remaining imaging  agent in the cannula is rinsed, 
IPSEN GROUP D-FR-01070-002 
 C O N F I D E N T I A L   PROTOCOL: VERSION 5.0, AMENDMENT 3.0: 20 MAY 2019 PAGE 44/125 
 
 
when appropriate, with 10 mL normal saline (0.9 % NaCl solution ). The PET/CT scanner must 
be the same for the two scans per subject and for all subjects at the same study site. 
There are no fasting conditions, nor food restrictions that sho uld apply when administering 
68Ga-OPS202 to the subject. N.B.: 68Ga-OPS202 is labelled according to Good 
Radiopharmaceutical Practice (G RPP) per EANM guidelines and acc ording to national 
regulations on radiopharmaceuticals. The radiopharmacy will rec eive training and specific 
written instructions on the labelling procedure.  
Radiation dose:  
According to data published for f luorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET th e effective dose was 
6.23 mSv [ 14]. Doses from FDG PET scanning to the gonads, uterus, and bladd er were higher 
than to the other organs and were 5.0, 7.8, and 59.2 mSv, respe ctively. This is because of the 
final accumulation of 18F in the bladder. Other organ doses ran ged from 2.5 to 4.8 mSv. The 
total effective doses of the combined PET/CT studies, calculate d by summing the effective 
doses of CT and PET scanning ranged from 13.45 to 31.91 mSv for  female patients and 13.65 
to 32.18 mSv for male patients taking various CT protocols into  consideration [ 14]. Average 
contrast-enhanced CT of abdomen and pelvis dose is 20 mSv [ 15]. 
In the phase I/II study 68Ga-OPS202, the calculated effective dose for an injection of 15 0 MBq 
(4 mCi) of 68Ga-OPS202 was 3.6 mSv, which is lower than the radioactivity do se of the 
FDA- and EMA-approved OctreoscanTM.  
In this trial, each subject will get two PET/CT examinations wi th a 2- to 3-week interval 
between the two examinations. The total 68Ga-OPS202 in each 3-study arm will range from 
140 to 340 MBq (calculated by summing the doses at Visit 2 and Visit 3). Based on phase I/II 
study, the total dose for the study will range from approximate ly 3.6 mSv to 7.5 mSv. The dose 
of two CTs will depend on the imaging protocols and will not ex ceed 20 mSv for each CT 
examination. Thus, total cumulative dose for two PET/CT examina tions will range from 
approximately 44 to 48 mSv. 
6.1.1.1  Spillage 
All due precautions and site procedures should be implemented t o prevent spillage or leakage 
of radiodiagnostics. Infusion bags, intravenous lines, venous a ccess should all be secured and 
the connections thoroughly checked. The infusion line should be  taped in a loop and taped to 
the subject to prevent direct tension between the line and the venous access. 
Despite precautions, if spillage or leakage should occur, then the site procedures must be 
implemented to protect the subject, staff and members of the pu blic from radiation exposure. 
The subject should be moved from the area of the spillage or le akage while the area is 
decontaminated. Details of the spillage or leakage should be re corded (including how the 
incident happened, the time of the incident, an estimate (if po ssible) of the amount of substance 
lost) and the measures taken. In addition, the incident is to b e reported in the same manner as 
an adverse event using the MedDRA PT Product Leakage and as app ropriate PT Occupational 
exposure to radiation (if there is exposure to staff) and PT Ex posure to radiation (if there is 
exposure to the subject or members of the public). 
6.1.2 Other Investigational Medicinal Products 
There are no investigational products other than 68Ga-OPS202 in this study. 
6.1.3 Other Study Drugs 
Not applicable.

6.2 Concomitant Medication/Therapy 
Any relevant prior or concomitant therapy or medication given t o a subject within 3 months 
before IIP administration, during IIP administration and up to the end of the follow-up period 
will be indicated on the eCRF. Dose and generic name or tradena me will be recorded. 
The following concomitant medications /therapies are not permit ted during this study up to the 
second PET/CT scan and 48 hours  post second OPS202 scan: 
• Administration of any radiopharmaceutical 
• On Visit 2 and Visit 3 parenteral amino acid solutions and any formulation of diuretics 
are not allowed. Stable adjusted diuretics such as for subjects  with hypertension are 
permitted. 
Long acting SSAs, ie, Somatuline® Autogel® /Depot® (60, 90 or 120 mg) and Sandostatin® LAR 
(20 or 30 mg) will not be allowed within 28 days prior to the f irst 68Ga-OPS202 PET/CT exam 
(at Visit 2) and during the study up to Visit 3 after the secon d 68Ga-OPS202 PET/CT exam has 
been completed. Short acting Sandostatin® is allowed during the study with a washout period 
of 24 hours before each of the two 68Ga-OPS202 PET/CT (Visit 2 and Visit 3), to avoid possible 
interaction between the non-radioactive SSA and OPS202. 
Subjects on long acting SSA who need to continue such treatment  for symptom control, should 
be switched to short acting SSA with a 24 hour wash out period before each of the two 
68Ga-OPS202 PET/CT (Visit 2 and Visit 3). Long acting SSAs can be  resumed after Visit 3. 
Other concomitant medications are permitted during this study a t the discretion of the 
investigator but they must be monitored closely and every effor t should be made to keep their 
dose and dose regimen constant t hroughout the course of the stu dy.  
6.3 Procedures for Monitoring Subject Compliance 
The IIP is administered i.v. by the investigator or his/her del egate. Therefore, no specific 
procedure is required for monitoring subject compliance. The in jected peptide mass dose and 
radioactivity dose will be recorded in the medical file and in the eCRF for each subject. 
The investigator will ensure that the subject did not and is no t taking any of the prohibited 
medication listed in Section 6.2 during the study period.

7 ASSESSMENT OF EFFICACY 
For the timing of efficacy assessments in this study, refer to the schedule in Table 5 .  
The sets of images obtained at Visit 2 and Visit 3 for the prim ary endpoint and most of the 
secondary endpoint analyses will be sent to an ICL for centrali sed blinded reading by two 
independent experienced radiologists/nuclear medicine physician s, and a third for adjudication 
of discordances. The readers will be specifically trained for t his protocol. Full details of the 
read design and conduct will  be provided in the IRC. 
For the primary endpoint analysis, the number of lesions on eac h subject scan will be counted 
on a per organ basis by the two primary independent readers. Sc ans will be blinded to subject, 
site, peptide and radioactivity dose. In case of discrepancy, i mages will go to the adjudicator 
(third reader) for a final read and adjudication.  
After blinded reading, the readers will compare the paired scan  for each subject and note which 
of the pair provides superior ima ges based on overall image qua lity and lesion count. 
The primary endpoint is the mean number of lesions identified i n each tabular cell (see  Table 
3) as the ratio of the maximum number of lesions identified per organ per subject, removing 
individually differing absolute lesion numbers as a confounder and allowing the factorial design 
to be established to identify the optimum peptide mass and radi oactivity dose. 
The sequence of image display and recording of results will be as follows on a per subject basis: 
1) Review of the two image sets of 68Ga-OPS202 scans in randomised step-wise fashion, 
without and with CT image fusion. The PET and CT images acquire d at the same time 
will be used for co-registration. 
2) CT images for standard-of-truth assessments will be reviewed by  two radiologists not 
involved in PET/CT images read. It is not anticipated that ther e will be a difference in 
the lesion counts between the two visits related to disease pro gression, due to slow 
development of GEP-NETs; however, there may be technical reason s for variations 
between the scans 
3) Review of the lesion-to-background ratios in each major anatomi cal site (liver, lymph 
nodes, bone and lungs) based on the evaluation of up to five mo st avid lesions per organ 
4) SUV max calculations of the five most avid lesions per organ on PET sc ans (liver, lymph 
nodes, bone and lungs) 
5) For image quality, direct comparison of the two 68Ga-OPS202 scans with different 
peptide and radioactivity doses  
6) Evaluation of previously acquired ssrt2 receptor agonist positi ve scans. 
7.1 Primary Efficacy Endpoint and Evaluation 
For each combination of injected peptide/radioactivity dose ran ges, differences in relative 
lesion counts derived from a 2 × 3 factorial analysis measuring  the ratio of the number of lesions 
detected by 68Ga-OPS202 to the number of lesions assessed by standard-of-trut h:  blinded 
read-out (derived from above recording of results, points 1 and  2) with descriptive analyses. 
7.2 Secondary Efficacy Endpoints and Evaluations 
Key Secondary Endpoint: 
• For each combination of injected peptide/radioactivity dose ran ges, differences in image 
quality derived from a 2 × 3 factorial analysis measuring the t umour-to-background ratio 
in each of the major anatomic sites (descriptive analyses for l iver, lymph nodes, bone 
and lungs)

 C O N F I D E N T I A L   PROTOCOL: VERSION 5.0, AMENDMENT 3.0: 20 MAY 2019 PAGE 47/125 
 
 
A qualitative analysis of the image quality as assessed by the blinded readers will be performed 
to back up the quantitative quality measured by tumour-to-backg round analysis.  
For further details, refer to the IRC. Other Secondary Endpoints: • Differences of lesion SUV
max between the two peptide mass dose ranges and the three 
radioactivity dose ranges measured in the most avid lesions: de scriptive analyses for up 
to a maximum of five lesions per organ (derived from above reco rding of results, point 
4), in liver, lymph nodes, bone and lungs 
• Differences of absolute number of lesions between the two pepti de mass dose ranges and 
the three radioactivity dose ranges detected in each of the fol lowing anatomic sites, both 
as standalone and also compared to the standard-of-truth scans;  blinded read-out (derived 
from above recording of results, points 1 and 2) with descripti ve analyses:  
• Primary site of GEP-NET  
• Lymph nodes  
• Liver  
• Axial/appendicular skeleton  
• Lungs 
• The primary and secondary endpoints will also be evaluated on a  radioactivity dose/kg 
of body weight. 
Exploratory Endpoints: 
• Preliminary diagnostic sensitivity of 68Ga-OPS202 imaging of GEP-NETs by both 
subject-based and lesion-based analysis compared to standard-of -truth 
• Comparison to sstr2 agonist positive scan results will be compu ted for sensitivity analysis 
• Differences in SUV max ratios between the two peptide mass dose ranges and three 
radioactivity dose ranges for lesions. 
• SNR calculated from lesion-free VOI in the liver: SUV mean/SUV SD between the three 
radioactivity doses. 
For further details on efficacy secondary endpoints assessment,  refer to the IRC.

8 ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY 
The safety and tolerability of 68Ga-OPS202 consists of evaluating: 
• AEs throughout the study 
• Clinical laboratory test results (serum chemistry, haematology,  urinalysis) throughout 
the study 
• Vital signs measurements (bl ood pressure and heart rate) throug hout the study  
• ECG at Visit 1 and 4 (End of treatment/ Early Withdrawal) 
• Physical examination results throughout the study 
• Concomitant medication usage throughout the study. 
8.1 Adverse Events 
Adverse events will be monitored from the time that the subject  gives informed consent and 
throughout the study (see Section 3.5 for a definition of the study duration) and will be elicited 
by direct, nonleading questioning or by spontaneous reports. Fu rther details for AE reporting 
can be found in Section 8.1.1 . 
Definition of an Adverse Event 
An AE is the development of an undesirable medical condition or  the deterioration of a 
pre-existing medical condition following or during exposure to a pharmaceutical product, 
whether or not considered causally related to the product. An u ndesirable medical condition can 
be symptoms (e.g. nausea, chest pain), signs (e.g. tachycardia,  enlarged liver) or the abnormal 
results of an investigation (e.g. laboratory findings, electroc ardiogram). In clinical studies, an 
AE can include an undesirable medical condition occurring at an y time, including run in or 
washout periods, even if no IIP has been administered.  
This definition includes events occurring from the time of the subject giving informed consent 
until the end of the study (as defined in Section 3.5). 
8.1.1 Categorisation of Adverse Events 
8.1.1.1  Intensity Classification 
Adverse events will be recorded and graded according to the cur rent version of the NCI-CTCAE 
(version 5.0). In view of meta-analyses, and for conversion pur poses, the following conversion 
mapping will apply if the NCI-CTCAE scale is not available for a given AE: 
• NCI-CTCAE Grade 1 corresponds to mild, 
• NCI-CTCAE Grade 2 corresponds to moderate, 
• NCI-CTCAE Grade 3 corresponds to severe, 
• NCI-CTCAE Grade 4 corresponds to life threatening/disabling, 
• NCI-CTCAE Grade 5 corresponds to death (related to AE). 
Where:  • Mild : symptoms do not alter the subject’s no rmal functioning 
• Moderate : symptoms produce some degree of impairment to function, but a re not 
hazardous, uncomfortable or embarrassing to the subject 
• Severe : symptoms definitely hazardous to wellbeing, significant impai rment of function 
or incapacitation. 
IPSEN GROUP D-FR-01070-002 
 C O N F I D E N T I A L   PROTOCOL: VERSION 5.0, AMENDMENT 3.0: 20 MAY 2019 PAGE 50/125 
 
 
• Life threatening : any event that places the subject at immediate risk of death from the 
event as it occurred, i.e. it does not include a reaction that,  had it occurred in a more 
severe form, might have caused death (also see Section 8.1.3 ). 
8.1.1.2  Causality Classification 
The relationship of an AE to IIP administration will be classif ied according to the following: 
• Related : reports including good reasons and sufficient information (e. g. plausible time 
sequence, dose response relationship, pharmacology, positive de challenge and/or 
rechallenge) to assume a causal relationship with IIP administr ation in the sense that it is 
plausible, conceivable or likely. 
• Not related : reports including good reasons and sufficient information (e. g. implausible 
time sequence and/or attributable to concurrent disease or othe r drugs) to rule out a causal 
relationship with IIP administration. 
8.1.1.3  Assessment of Expectedness 
The expectedness of an AE shall be determined by the sponsor ac cording to the IIP IB.  
The reference document for assessing expectedness of AEs/event in this study will be the 
current IB . 
8.1.1.4  Laboratory Test Abnormalities 
All abnormalities in laboratory test values should only be repo rted as AEs if any of the 
following apply:  
• They result in a change in IIP schedule of administration (chan ge in dosage, delay  in 
administration, IIP discontinuation), 
• They require intervention or a diagnosis evaluation to assess t he risk to the subject, 
• They are considered as clinically significant by the investigat or, or the laboratory test 
abnormality suggests a disease and/or organ toxicity that is ne w or has worsened from 
baseline based on sponsor review. 
8.1.1.5  Abnormal Physical Examination Findings  
Clinically significant changes, in the judgement of the investi gator, in physical examination 
findings (abnormalities) will be recorded as AEs.  
8.1.1.6  Other Investigation Abnormal Findings 
Abnormal test findings as judged by the investigator as clinica lly significant 
(e.g., electrocardiogram changes) that result in a change in II P dosage or administration 
schedule, or in discontinuation of the IIP, or require interven tion or diagnostic evaluation to 
assess the risk to the subject, should be recorded as AEs.  
8.1.2 Recording and Follow up of Adverse Events 
At each visit, the subject should be asked a non- leading question such as: “How have you felt 
since the administration or last administration of the study co mpound.”  
All observed or volunteered AEs, regardless of study arm or sus pected causal relationship to 
IIP, will be recorded on the AE page(s) of the eCRF. Events inv olving drug reactions, accidents, 
illnesses with onset during the treatment phase of the study, o r exacerbations of pre-existing 
illnesses should be recorded according to NCI terminology.  
Any AEs already recorded and designated as ‘continuing’ should be reviewed at each 
subsequent assessment. 
IPSEN GROUP D-FR-01070-002 
 C O N F I D E N T I A L   PROTOCOL: VERSION 5.0, AMENDMENT 3.0: 20 MAY 2019 PAGE 51/125 
 
 
For all AEs, the investigator must pursue and obtain informatio n adequate both to determine 
the outcome of the AE and to assess whether it meets the criter ia for classification as a SAE 
requiring immediate notification to the sponsor or its designat ed representative. For all AEs, 
sufficient information should be obtained by the investigator t o determine the causality of the 
AE (i.e. IIP or other illness). The investigator is required to  assess causality and record that 
assessment on the eCRF. Follow-up of the AE, after the date of IIP discontinuation, is required 
if the AE or its sequelae persist. Follow-up is required until the event or its sequelae resolve or 
stabilise at a level acceptable to the investigator and the spo nsor’s clinical monitor or his/her 
designated representative. 
8.1.3 Reporting of Serious Adverse Events 
All SAEs (as defined below) regardless of study arm or suspecte d relationship to IIP must be 
reported immediately (within 24 hours of the investigator’s kno wledge of the event) using the 
fax number specified at the beginning of this protocol. If the immediate report is submitted by 
telephone, this must be followed by detailed written reports us ing the SAE report form. 
A SAE  is any AE that: 
1) Results in death, 
2) Is life threatening, that is any event that places the subject at immediate risk of death 
from the event as it occurred. It does not include an event tha t, had it occurred in a more 
severe form, might have caused death, 
3) Results in inpatient hospitalisation or prolongation of existin g hospitalisation, excluding 
admission for social or administrative reasons (see further), 
4) Results in a persistent or significant disability/incapacity, w here disability is a substantial 
disruption of a person's ability to conduct normal life functio ns, 
5) Results in congenital anomaly/birth defect in the offspring of a subject who received the 
IIP, 
6) Is an important medical event that may not result in death, be life threatening, or require 
hospitalisation when, based upon appropriate medical judgement,  may jeopardise the 
subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to pre vent one of the outcomes 
listed in this definition. Examples of such medical events incl ude allergic bronchospasm 
requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or 
convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalisation, or  the development of drug 
dependency or drug abuse. 
In addition to the above criteria, any additional AE that the s ponsor or an investigator considers 
serious should be immediately reported to the sponsor and inclu ded in the corporate SAEs 
database system. 
• Hospitalisation is defined as any inpatient admission (even if less than 24 hours). For 
chronic or long-term inpatients, inpatient admission also inclu des transfer within the 
hospital to an acute/intensive care inpatient unit. 
• Prolongation of hospitalisation  is defined as any extension of an inpatient 
hospitalisation beyond the stay anticipated/required in relatio n to the original reason for 
the initial admission, as determined by the investigator or treating physician . For 
protocol-specified hospitalisation in clinical studies, prolong ation is defined as any 
extension beyond the length of stay described in the protocol. Prolongation in the absence 
of a precipitating, treatment-emergent, clinical AE (i.e. not a ssociated with the 
development of a new AE or worsening of a pre-existing conditio n) may meet criteria

for "seriousness" but is not an adverse experience and thus is not subject to immediate 
reporting to the sponsor.  
• Pre-planned or elective treatments/surgical procedures should be no ted in the subject’s 
screening documentation. Hospitalisation for a pre-planned or e lective treatment/surgical 
procedure should not be reported as an SAE unless there are com plications or sequelae 
that meet the criteria for ser iousness described above. 
Any SAE must be reported immediately (within 24 hours), to Ipse n Pharmacovigilance through 
the email (preferably) or fax number specified at the beginning  of this protocol, independent of 
the circumstances or suspected cause, if it occurs or comes to the attention of the investigator 
at any time during the study period. 
Any AE/SAE with a suspected causal relationship to IIP administ ration occurring at any other 
time after completion of the study must be promptly reported. 
The following information is the minimum that must be provided to the sponsor within 24 hours 
for each SAE: 
• Study number 
• Centre number 
• Subject number 
• AE 
• Investigator's name and contact details 
The additional information included in the SAE form must be pro vided to the sponsor or 
representative as soon as it is available. The investigator sho uld always provide an assessment 
of causality for each event reported to the sponsor. Upon recei pt of the initial report, the sponsor 
will ask for the investigator's causality assessment if it was not provided with the initial report. 
The investigator should report a diagnosis or a syndrome rather  than individual signs or 
symptoms. The investigator should also try to separate a primar y AE considered as the foremost 
untoward medical occurrence from secondary AEs which occurred a s complications. 
8.1.4 Pregnancy 
Pregnancy itself is not regarded as an AE unless there is a sus picion that the IIP has interfered 
with a contraceptive method. If pregnancy occurs during the stu dy, the outcome of the 
pregnancy will then need to be collected after the study and it  may be necessary to discontinue 
administration of the IIP.  
Information regarding pregnancies must be collected on the AE p age of the eCRF and reported 
to the sponsor as an SAE. The sponsor will request further info rmation from the investigator as 
to the course and outcome of the pregnancy using the Standard P regnancy Outcome Report 
Form.  
The investigator must instruct all subjects to inform them imme diately should they or their 
female partner become pregnant during the study. In case the in vestigator becomes aware of 
pregnancy occurring in a subject (pregnancy test before each ex posure to the IIP), the IIP 
administration should be stopped and the subject followed up un til Visit 4 (End of the study). 
The investigator should counsel the subject, discuss the risks,  if any, and the possible effects on 
the foetus. Monitoring of the subject (or female partner of a m ale subject) who becomes 
pregnant during the study after the administration of at least one of the two single IIP injections 
should continue until conclusion of the pregnancy, which may in volve follow up after the 
subject’s involvement in the study has ended (as per Ipsen’s st andard pharmacovigilance).  
IPSEN GROUP D-FR-01070-002 
 C O N F I D E N T I A L   PROTOCOL: VERSION 5.0, AMENDMENT 3.0: 20 MAY 2019 PAGE 53/125 
 
 
Pregnancies with a probable conception date within completion o f the study (30 days after 
subject’s last dose of IIP)  must also be reported to the investigator for onward reporting to the 
sponsor. 
If the investigator becomes aware of a pregnancy occurring in t he partner of a subject 
participating in the study, this should be reported to the spon sor. After the partner has given 
written consent, she should be counselled and followed as descr ibed above. Monitoring of the 
partner should continue until t he pregnancy comes to an end. 
8.1.5 Deaths 
For AEs leading to death, NCI CTCAE Grade 5 is the only appropr iate grade (see 
Section 8.1.1.1 ). Deaths that cannot be attributed to an NCI CTCAE term associate d with Grade 
5 or that cannot be reported within an NCI CTCAE category as ‘O ther’ have to be reported as 
one of these four AE options: 
• Death not otherwise specified (NOS), 
• Disease progression NOS, 
• Multi-organ failure, 
• Sudden death. 
The term “sudden death” should only be used for the occurrence of an abrupt and unexpected 
death due to presumed cardiac causes in a patie nt with or without pre-existing heart disease, 
within 1 hour of the onset of acute symptoms or , in the case of an unwitnessed death, within 24 
hours after the patient was last seen alive and st able. If the cause of death is unknown and 
cannot be ascertained at t he time of reporting, “unexplained death” should be recorded on the 
Adverse Event eCRF. If the cause of death later becomes available (e.g. after autopsy), 
“unexplained death” should be replaced  by the established cause of death.”  
8.1.6 Discontinuation/Withdrawal due to Adve rse Events/Serious Adverse Events 
Discontinuation/withdrawal due to AEs should be distinguished f rom 
discontinuation/withdrawal due to insufficient response to the IIP (see Section 4.3). 
If the second dose of IIP cannot be given due to a SAE followin g Visit 2 administration, it must 
be reported immediately to the s ponsor’s designated representat ive (see Section 8.1.3 ). 
In all cases, the investigator must ensure the subject is adequ ately followed up (see 
Section 8.1.2 ). 
Reporting to Competent Authorities/IECs/IRBs/Other Investigator s 
The sponsor will ensure that processes are in place for submiss ion of reports of SUSARs 
occurring during the study to the CA, independent ethics commit tees (IECs) and other 
investigators concerned by the IIP. Reporting will be done in a ccordance with the applicable 
regulatory requirements. 
For study centres in the USA, Investigational New Drug (IND) ap plication safety reports will 
be submitted directly to the investigators . It is the investigators’ responsibility to notify their 
institutional review board (IRB) in a timely manner. 
8.2 Clinical Laboratory Tests 
Blood samples will be collected at all study visits (Screening Visit [Visit 1], Baseline/Day 1 
[Visit 2], Visit 3, and End of Study/Early Withdrawal [Visit 4] ) (see schedule of assessment in 
Table 5 ) or the evaluation of haematology and serum chemistry. Urine sam ples will be collected 
only at Visit 2 and Visit 3 to determine the amount of renal ex cretion of OPS202.  
IPSEN GROUP D-FR-01070-002 
 C O N F I D E N T I A L   PROTOCOL: VERSION 5.0, AMENDMENT 3.0: 20 MAY 2019 PAGE 54/125 
 
 
The investigator will review the safety laboratory test results , document the review, and record 
any clinically relevant result occurring or observed during the  study in the AE section of the 
eCRF (see Section 8.1.1.4  for abnormal laboratory tests that should be recorded as AEs).  
All clinically relevant abnormal laboratory tests occurring dur ing the study will be repeated at 
appropriate intervals until they return to Baseline or to a lev el deemed acceptable by the 
investigator and the sponsor’s clinical monitor (or his/her des ignat ed representative) or until the 
abnormality is explained by an appropriate diagnosis.  
8.2.1 Haematology 
Blood samples will be collected (in a potassium ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid [EDTA] tube) 
to assess the following parameters: red blood cell (RBC) count,  haemoglobin, haematocrit, 
mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular haemoglobin (MC H), mean corpuscular 
haemoglobin concentration (MCHC), white blood cell (WBC) absolu te count (neutrophils, 
lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, basophils, and others) and  platelet count. 
8.2.2 Blood Biochemistry 
Blood samples will be collected t o assess the following paramet ers: 
• urea, creatinine, total bilirubin, conjugated bilirubin 
• chloride, bicarbonate, sodium, potassium, calcium, phosphate 
• AP, AST, ALT, gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) 
• albumin, total protein, total cholesterol, triglycerides, fasti ng glucose 
8.2.3 Urinalysis 
Fresh urine samples (at least 10 mL) will be collected to asses s the following parameters: pH, 
protein, ketones, bilirubin, blood, urobilinogen, nitrites, leu kocyte esterase, glucose and specific 
gravity by dipstick.  
Microscopy will be performed, if indicated, but results will no t be collected in the eCRF. If in 
the opinion of the investigator there are any clinically signif icant abnormalities in microscopy, 
they will be recorded as an AE in the eCRF. 
8.2.4 Pregnancy Test 
A ßHCG test will be performed for all female subjects of childb earing potential at Screening 
(Visit 1) and End of Study Visit (Visit 4). A urinary hCG test will be performed at Baseline 
Visit (Visit 2) before first IIP administration and at Visit 3 before second IIP administration and 
if clinically indicated. Any subject becoming pregnant during t he study will be withdrawn. All 
pregnancies (including in female partners of male participants)  that occur during the study are 
to be reported as described in Section 8.1.4 . 
8.2.5 Putative Antibody Testing 
Not applicable 
8.2.6 Other Clinical Laboratory Tests 
Not applicable.  
8.3 Physical Examination 
Physical examinations, including body weight, will be conducted  at Screening, Baseline 
(Visit 2), Visit 3 and End of Study (Visit 4)/Early Withdrawal (see Table 5 ), and height will be 
measured at Screening. 
IPSEN GROUP D-FR-01070-002 
 C O N F I D E N T I A L   PROTOCOL: VERSION 5.0, AMENDMENT 3.0: 20 MAY 2019 PAGE 55/125 
 
 
Any clinically significant physical examination findings (abnor malities) observed during the 
study will be reported as AEs . Any physical examination finding s (abnormalities) persisting at 
the end of the study will be followed by the investigator until  resolution or until reaching a 
clinically stable endpoint. 
8.4 Vital Signs 
Blood pressure and heart rate will be assessed with an automate d device so that measurements 
are independent of the observer. Blood pressure and heart rate will be recorded after five 
minutes rest in sitting position and after one minute standing.  Absolute values and change from 
Baseline will be analysed. 
Respiratory rate and temperatu re (tympanic/oral) will be record ed. 
8.5 Electrocardiography 
An ECG analysis will be include d as a safety evaluation/endpoin t in this study. 
The ECGs will be recorded at Screening Visit, and End of Study/ Early Withdrawal (Visit 4). 
Twelve-lead ECGs will be recorded at a paper speed of 25 mm/sec  so that the different ECG 
intervals (RR, PR, QRS, QT) can be measured automatically as pe r study site usual practice. 
The ECG will be recorded with the subject in supine position af ter five minutes of rest until 
four regular consecutive complexes are available. ECG interval estimates will be measured as 
per study site usual practice, in this study. 
Any clinically significant abnormalities will be recorded as AE s.

9 ASSESSMENTS OF PHARMACOKINETICS/PHARMACODYNAMICS 
9.1  Pharmacokinetics 
9.1.1 Sample Collection 
Subjects randomized to each of the six dose range combinations of peptide mass and 
radioactivity will particip ate in the OPS202 PK sampling. 
Blood samples (2 mL each) for determination of OPS202 plasma co ncentrations will be 
collected preferably by venepuncture in low-binding tubes at th e following timepoints: Baseline 
pre-dose (T0), 5 min, 15 to 45min, 1h, 2h, 3h and 6h after the 68Ga-OPS202 i.v. administration 
at the corresponding visits (Visit 2 and Visit 3).  
Urine collection in low-binding containers to determine renal e xcretion of OPS202 will be 
performed over the first 6 hours (0h to 3h and 3h to 6h after t he 68Ga-OPS202 i.v. administration 
at the corresponding visits: Visit 2 and Visit 3). Subjects wil l be asked to empty his/her bladder 
just before the 68Ga-OPS202 i.v. administration and then all urine voided during the collection 
interval (0-6 hours post 68Ga-OPS202 i.v. administration) will be collected and stored. 
All details about sample collection, storage and shipment will be provided in the 
Pharmacokinetics, Dynamics and Metabolism (PDM) Sample Manageme nt Plan/Laboratory 
Manual. 
During the study, the nominal sample collection times may be ch anged, but the total number of 
samples will not increase. The exact dates and times of blood s ample collection and study drug 
administration must be recorded in the eCRF. 
9.1.2 Analytical Procedures 
Plasma samples will be analysed  to determine concentrations of OPS202 using a validated, 
specific and sensitive liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectr ometry (LC-MS/MS) method 
at Kymos Pharma Services, Barcelona, Spain. As an exploratory a nalysis, some of the 
additional plasma samples may be used to measure potential meta bolites (identified during 
pre-clinical investigations) using a qualified LC-MS/MS method.   
Urine samples will be analysed to determine concentrations of O PS202 using a validated 
method. As an exploratory analysis, some of the urine samples m ight be used to explore 
potential metabolites. 
9.1.3 Data Analysis 
Individual plasma and urine con centrations for OPS202 will be l isted and summarised by 
timepoints and dose range combinations using descriptive statis tics for continuous variables 
(number of available observations, mean, median, standard devia tion, minimum, maximum, 
geometric mean, and geometric coefficient of variation assuming  log-normally distributed 
data). Linear and semilogarithmics plots of individual and mean  plasma concentration-time 
profiles as well as spaghetti plots will be reported. 
Analysis of plasma and urine PK data by non-compartmental appro ach using Phoenix 
WinNonLin Version 6.3 or higher will be documented in a separat e analysis plan. The analysis 
of PK data will be performed by a CRO under Ipsen Clinical PK d epartment’s supervision and 
if warranted by the data the fol lowing parameters, but not limi ted to, will be computed: 
• Cmax 
• AUC last 
• AUC ∞

• Elimination half-life (T 1/2) 
• Total plasma clearance (CL) 
• Volume of distribution (V) 
• Excreted amount in the urine over each time interval (0h to 3h and 3h to 6h after the 
68Ga-OPS202 i.v. administration at the corresponding visits: Visi t 2 and Visit 3), as well 
as the 6-hour Ae). 
Descriptive summary statistics ( the number of observations [n],  mean, median, standard 
deviation [SD] and range for continuous variables, and n and pe r cent [%] for 
categorical/nominal variables) will be presented for each PK pa rameter. 
Additional exploratory model-based analysis (population PK anal ysis) might also be conducted 
using NONMEM software.

Descriptive summary statistics (n, mean, SD, median, minimum, m aximum) and frequency 
counts of demographic and baseline data (medical history, conco mitant disease, predosing AEs 
and ongoing medical history, prior medications and therapies, b aseline  symptoms, etc.) will be 
presented by study arm and overall for the randomised and PP populations.  
10.4.2  Homogeneity of Treatment Groups  
Not applicable.  
10.4.3  Subject Disposition and Withdrawals  
The numbers and percentages of subjects enrolled and included i n each of the randomised, PP 
and safety populations will be tabulated by arm. The reasons fo r subject exclusions from each 
of the populations will be listed and tabulated by arm. In addi tion, the numbers of subjects who 
were randomised, received IIP, discontinued an d completed at each of the study periods (e.g. 
Visit 2 and Visit 3, active follow -up period) will be tabulated by arm. Primary reasons for 
discontinuation of study IIP will be listed and tabulated by ar m. 
10.4.4  Pharmacokinetic Data  
The pharmacokinetic data analysis will be performed independent ly by a CRO under Ipsen 
Clinical PK department’s supervision as described in Section 9.1.3 . 
Individual listings and summary tables of OPS202 plasma concent rations and amount excreted 
in urine will be provided . 
10.4.5  Efficacy Evaluation  
As indicated in Section 7.1, the primary efficacy variable is the differences in relative lesion 
counts derived from a 2 × 3 factorial analysis measuring the ra tio of the number of lesions 
detected by 68Ga-OPS202 to the  number of lesions assessed by standard -of-truth, for each 
combination of injected peptide/radioactivity dose ranges. Prim ary efficacy variable will be 
summarised by study arm and by each combination peptide/radioac tivity dose range.  
As indicated in Sectio n 7.2, the secondary efficacy variables are the below listed variabl es 
measured at Visit 2 and Visit 3 after the i.v. administration o f the IIP:

• Differences in image quality derived from a 2 × 3 factorial ana lysis measuring, for each 
combination of injected peptide/radioactivity dose ranges, the tumour-to-background 
ratio in each of the major anatomic sites (descriptive analyses  for liver, lymph nodes, 
bone and lungs). Key secondary efficacy variable will be summar ised by study arm and 
by each combination peptide/radioactivity dose range. A qualita tive analysis of the image 
assessed by the blinded readers will be performed to back up th e quantitative quality 
measured by tumour-to-background analysis. 
Other Secondary Endpoints: • Differences of lesion SUV
max between the two peptide mass dose ranges and the three 
radioactivity dose ranges measured in the most avid lesions (de scriptive analyses for up 
to a maximum of five lesions per organ), in liver, lymph nodes,  bone and lungs 
• Differences of absolute number of lesions between the two pepti de mass dose ranges and 
the three radioactivity dose ranges detected in each of the fol lowing anatomic sites:  
• Primary site of GEP-NET  
• Lymph nodes  
• Liver  
• Axial/appendicular skeleton  
• Lungs. 
Exploratory Endpoints: • Preliminary diagnostic sensitivity of 
68Ga-OPS202 imaging of GEP-NETs by both 
subject-based and lesion-based analysis compared to standard-of -truth 
• Comparison to sstr2 agonist positive scan results will be compu ted for sensitivity analysis 
• Differences in SUV max ratios between the two peptide mass dose ranges and three 
radioactivity dose ranges for lesions 
• SNR calculated from lesion-free VOI in the liver: SUV mean/SUV SD between the three

12 QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE 
12.1 Protocol Amendments and Protocol Deviations and Violations 
12.1.1  Protocol Amendments 
No changes from the final approved (signed) protocol will be in itiated without the prior written 
approval or favourable opinion of a written amendment by the IE C/IRB, except when necessary 
to eliminate immediate safety concerns to the subjects or when the change involves only 
logistics or administration. The principal investigator and the  sponsor will sign the protocol 
amendment. 
12.1.2  Protocol Deviations, Violations, and Exceptions 
All protocol deviations will be identified and recorded by the sponsor or sponsor’s 
representative (see Section 10.1). 
A major protocol deviation is any significant divergence from t he protocol, i.e. nonadherence 
on the part of the subject, the investigator, or the sponsor to  protocol-specific 
inclusion/exclusion criteria, pr imary objective evaluation crit eria, and/or GCP guidelines.  
Generally, a protocol deviation qualifies as major if: 
• The deviation has harmed or posed a significant or substantive risk of harm to the 
research subject  
• The deviation compromises the sc ientific integrity of the data collected for the study  
• The deviation is a willful or knowing breach of human subject p rotection regulations, 
policies, or procedures on the part of the investigator(s)  
• The deviation involves a serious or continuing noncompliance wi th any applicable 
human subject protection regulations, policies, or procedures  
• The deviation is inconsistent with Ipsen’s research, medical an d ethical principles.  
See also Section  10.1.2 for details on the impact of major protocol deviations on the i nclusion 
of subjects in each analysis population. 
A minor protocol deviation is any significant divergence from t he protocol that does not impact 
the study results. 
12.2 Information to Study Personnel 
The investigator is responsible for giving information about th e study to all staff members 
involved in the study or in any element of subject management, both before starting any study 
procedures and during the course of the study (e.g. when new st aff become involved, or new 
information becomes available). The investigator must assure th at all study staff members are 
qualified by education, experience, and training to perform the ir specific responsibilities. These 
study staff members must be listed on the study centre authoris ation form, which includes a 
clear description of each staff member’s responsibilities. This  list must be updated throughout 
the study, as necessary. 
The study monitor is responsible for explaining the protocol to  all study staff, including the 
investigator, and for ensuring their compliance with the protoc ol. Additional information will 
be made available during the study when new staff become involv ed in the study and as 
otherwise agreed upon with either the investigator or the study  monitor. 
12.3 Study Monitoring 
The investigator is responsible for the validity of all data co llected at the site. 
IPSEN GROUP D-FR-01070-002 
 C O N F I D E N T I A L   PROTOCOL: VERSION 5.0, AMENDMENT 3.0: 20 MAY 2019 PAGE 64/125 
 
 
The sponsor is responsible for monitoring this data to verify t hat the rights and wellbeing of 
subjects are protected, that study data are accurate (complete and verifiable to source data) and 
that the study is conducted in compliance with the protocol, GC P and regulatory requirements. 
Sponsor assigned monitors will conduct regular site visits. The  investigator will allow direct 
access to all relevant files (for all subjects) and clinical st udy supplies (dispensing and storage 
areas) for the purpose of verifying entries made in the eCRF, and assist with the monitor’s 
activities, if requested. Adequate time and space for monitorin g visits should be made available 
by the investigator. 
The site must complete the eCRFs according to the sponsor monit oring manual, of the subject’s 
visit and on an ongoing basis to allow regular review by the st udy monitor, both remotely by 
the internet and during site visits.  The central study monitor at the sponsor will use functions 
of the electronic data capture (EDC) system to address any quer ies raised while reviewing the 
data entered by the study site personnel in a timely manner. 
Whenever a subject name is revealed on a document required by t he sponsor (e.g. laboratory 
printouts) the name must be blacked out permanently by the site  personnel, leaving the initials 
visible, and annotated with the s ubject number as identificatio n. 
12.4 Audit and Inspection 
Authorised personnel from external CAs and the sponsor’s author ised Quality Assurance 
personnel may carry out inspections and audits (see Section  11). 
Data Quality Assurance 
Monitored eCRFs transferred from the investigational site to th e assigned Data Management 
group will be reviewed (secondary monitoring) for completeness,  consistency, legibility and 
protocol compliance. 
Reasons should be given on the relevant eCRF for any missing da ta and other protocol 
deviations. Any electronic queries and items not adequately exp lained will require additional 
electronic manual queries to be raised to the investigator by t he monitor for 
clarification/correction. The investigator must ensure that que ries are dealt with promptly. All 
data changes and clarifications  can be viewed in the audit trai l function of the eCRF.

13 ETHICS 
13.1 Compliance with Good Clinical Practice and Ethical Consideratio ns 
This study will be conducted in compliance with IECs/IRBs, info rmed consent regulations, the 
Declaration of Helsinki and ICH GCP Guidelines (Section 1.1), and FDA, 21 CFR Part 11, 
Electronic Records, Electronic Signatures, and FDA, Guidance fo r Industry: Computerized 
Systems Used in Clinical Trials. 
In addition, this study will adhere to all local regulatory req uirements.  
Before initiating a study, the investigator/institution should have written and dated 
approval/favourable opinion from the IEC/IRB for the study prot ocol/amendment(s), written 
informed consent form, any consent form updates, subject emerge ncy study contact cards, 
subject recruitment procedures (e.g. advertisements), any writt en information to be provided to 
subjects and a statement from the IEC/IRB that they comply with  GCP requirements. The 
IEC/IRB approval must identify the protocol version as well as the documents reviewed. 
After IEC/IRB approval, changes will require a formal amendment . Once the study has started, 
amendments should be made only in exceptional circumstances. Ch anges that do not affect 
subject safety or data integrity are classified as administrati ve changes and generally do not 
require ethical approval. If ethically relevant aspects are con cerned, the IEC/IRB must be 
informed and, if necessary, approval sought prior to implementa tion. Ethical approval on 
administrative changes will be  obtained if required by local/si te IEC/IRB. 
13.2 Informed Consent 
Prior to study entry, the investigator, or a person designated by the investigator, will explain 
the nature, purpose, benefi ts and risks of participation in the study to each subject, sub ject’s 
legally acceptable representative or impartial witness. Written  informed consent must be 
obtained prior to the subject entering the study (before initia tion of any study-related procedure 
and administration of the IIP). Sufficient time will be allowed  to discuss any questions raised 
by the subject. 
The sponsor will provide a sample informed consent form. The fi nal version-controlled form 
must be agreed to by the sponsor, and the IEC/IRB and must cont ain all elements included in 
the sample form, in language readily understood by the subject.  Each subject’s original consent 
form, personally signed and dated by the subject or by the subj ect’s legally acceptable 
representative, and by the person who conducted the informed co nsent discussion, will be 
retained by the investigator. The investigator will supply subj ects with a copy of their signed 
informed consent. 
The consent form may need to be revised during the study follow ing a protocol amendment that 
includes important new information relevant to the safety of th e subject. In this instance 
approval should always be given by the IEC/IRB. It is the inves tigator’s responsibility to ensure 
that all subjects subsequently entered into the study and those  currently in the study sign the 
amended form. This is documented in the same way as previously described. Subjects who have 
completed the study should be informed of any new information t hat may impact on their 
welfare/wellbeing. 
The investigator sh ould, with the consent of the subject, inform the subject’s pri mary physician 
about their participation in the clinical study.

13.3 Health Authorities and Independent Ethics Committees/Institutio nal Review 
Boards 
As required by local regulations, the sponsor’s Regulatory Affairs group will ensure all legal 
regulatory aspects are covered, and obtain approval of the appr opriate regulatory bodies, prior 
to study initiation in regions where an approval is required. 
13.4 Confidentiality Regarding Study Subjects 
The investigator must assure that the privacy of the subjects, including their personal identity 
and all personal medical information, will be maintained at all  times. In eCRFs and other 
documents or image material submitted to the sponsor, subjects will be identified not by their 
names, but by an identification code (e.g. initials and identif ication number). 
Personal medical information may be reviewed for the purpose of  verifying data recorded on 
the eCRF. This review may be conducted by the study monitor, pr operly authorised persons on 
behalf of the sponsor, the quality assurance unit, or regulator y authorities. Personal medical 
information will always be t reated as confidential.

14 DATA HANDLING AND RECORD KEEPING 
14.1 Data Recording of Study Data 
In compliance with GCP, the medical records/medical notes, etc,  should be clearly marked and 
permit easy identification of a subject’s participation in the specified clinical study.  
The investigator must record all data relating to protocol proc edures, IIP administration, 
laboratory data, safety data on the eCRFs provided for the stud y. The investigator, by 
completing the signature log, may formally designate authority to complete eCRFs to 
appropriately qualified staff ha ving certified user access to t he eCRF .  
The investigator must, as a minimum, provide an electronic sign ature (e-signature) to each case 
report book to attest to the accuracy and completeness of all t he data. If any changes are made 
to the eCRF, after a form has been locked and electronically si gned, the investigator will be 
required to perform an additional e-signature authorising agree ment with any new information 
or changes to the eCRF. 
All corrections on the eCRF will be automatically tracked and a  reason for change is always 
required. In the eCRF, the audit trail function will allow the changes made to be viewed on each 
item entered. 
14.2 Data Management 
An EDC system will be utilised for collecting subject data. Eac h site is required to have a 
computer and internet connection available for site entry of cl inical data. All entries in the eCRF 
will be done under the electronic signature of the person perfo rming the action. This electronic 
signature consists of an indivi dual and confidential username a nd password combination. It is 
declared to be the legally binding equivalent of the handwritte n signature. Only sponsor 
authorised users will have access to the eCRF as appropriate to  their study responsibilities. 
Users must have successfully undergone software application tra ining prior to entering data into 
the eCRF. 
Data management will be conducted by a CRO, directed by the sponsor’ s data management 
department. All data managemen t procedures will be completed in  accordance with the 
contracted CRO standard operating procedures (SOPs), unless oth erwise specified. Prior to data 
being received in-house at the a ssigned CRO, it will be monitor ed at the investigator site, (for 
further details please see Section 12.3 Monitoring Procedures). The eCRF and other data 
documentation removed from the investigator site(s) will be tra cked by the CRO and the 
monitor. 
The sponsor will ensure that an appropriate eCRF is developed t o capture the data accurately, 
and suitable queries are raised to resolve any missing or incon sistent data. The investigator will 
receive their data, from the clinical study, in an electronic f ormat (PDF files) which will be an 
exact copy of the eCRF, and will include the full audit trail, for archiving purposes and future 
reference. 
Any queries generated during the data management process will a lso be tracked by the 
contracted data management CRO/ will be raised within the EDC sy stem. It is the central study 
monitor’s responsibility to ensure that all qu eries are resolved by the relevant parties. 
The sponsor will also ensure that SAE data collected in the eCR F are consistent with 
information provided to the sponsor’s  pharmacovigilance departm ent (and vice versa).  
The coding of AEs, medical history, concomitant medication, pro cedure and non-drug therapy 
terms will be performed centrally by the specialised CRO, direc ted by the sponsor’s Biometry 
Group, and reviewed and approved by the sponsor. Concomitant me dications will be coded

using WHO-DD (latest available ve rsion) and AEs/medical history  terms will be coded using 
MedDRA (latest available version). 
14.3 Record Archiving and Retention 
During the pre-study and initiation visits, the monitor must en sure the archiving facilities are 
adequate and archiving/retenti on responsibilities of the invest igator have been discussed.  
Study documents should be retained until at least 2 years after  the last approval of a marketing 
application in an ICH region and until there are no pending or planned marketing applications 
in an ICH region (that is at least 15 years) or at least 2 year s have elapsed since the formal 
discontinuation of clinical development of the product. However , these documents should be 
retained for a longer period if required by the applicable regu latory requirements or by an 
agreement with the sponsor. The investigator should take measur es to prevent accidental or 
premature destruction of these documents. The final archiving a rrangements will be confirmed by 
the monitor when closing out the  site. The sponsor will inform the investigator, in writing, as to 
when these documents no longer need to be retained. 
If the principal investigator relocates or retires, or otherwis e withdraws his/her responsibility 
for maintenance and retention of study documents, the sponsor m ust be notified (preferably in 
writing) so that adequate provisi on can be made for their futur e maintenance and retention.

funding or conduct of the study, including medical writers or s tatisticians subject to the consent 
of each individual and entity concerned, including acknowledgem ent of the sponsor. 
The results of this study may be published or communicated to s cientific meetings by the 
investigators involved in the study. For multicentre studies, a  plan for scientific publication and 
presentation of the results may be agreed and implemented by th e study investigators. The 
sponsor requires that reasonabl e opportunity be given to review  the content and conclusions of 
any abstract, presentation, or paper before the material is sub mitted for publication or 
communicated. This condition also applies to any amendments tha t are subsequently requested 
by referees or journal editors. The sponsor will undertake to c omment on the draft documents 
within the time period agreed in the contractual arrangements, including clinical trial 
agreements, governing the relationship between the sponsor and authors (or the author’s 
institution). Requested amendments will be incorporated by the author, provided they do not 
alter the scientific value of the material.

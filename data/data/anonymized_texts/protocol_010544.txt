This document may not -in full or in part -be passed on, reproduced, published or oth erwise used without prior written permission.1. Screening Visit and Visit 8 of 1160.106 tria l may be combined for patients who have completed the treatment period of 1160.106 trial (tests will be done only once)
2. Visit 1 and Visit 2 may occur on the same day provided that results of the local lab are available to confirm eligibility and INR is <2.3 (for patients who have been treated with 
VKA) . Local lab results will be recorded under Visit 1, central lab result s will be recorded under Visit 2 in the eCRF.
3. Visit 3 is not applicable for patients who have previously completed the treatment period in the dabigatran etexilate arm of the 1160.106 study andwho continue taking the same 
dose of dabigatran etexilate in t his trial. For all other patients ,during Visit 3 the trough dabigatran concentration will be determined 
 
 The first concentration assessment 
will be done at Visit 3 (after at least 6 consecutive dabigatran etexilate doses are taken) . If target trough exposure of 50 to <250 ng/mL is not achieved ,an Unscheduled Visit 
must be performed in order to adjust the dabigatran etexilate dose (refer to Appendix 10.4.2 ). A Titration Visit must be scheduled preferably after at least 3 days have elapsed (or 
at least 6 new doses have been taken) since a dose adjustment to reassess if the new trough dabigatran concentration is within the target range. Trough is achieved 10 to 16 hours 
after the last intake of dabigatran e texilate. Patients must not be dosed at home prior to attending a Titration Visit; dosing will be done after a trough plasma sample is collected .
4. Unscheduled Visits are to be conducted in all cases of suspected recurrent VTE, paradoxical embolism (PDE), oc currence of post -thrombotic syndrome (PTS), major or clinically -
relevant bleeding events (MBEs/CRBEs) or other AESI or SAE. The Unscheduled Visit should be performed as soon as possible, preferably within 24 hours after the site first 
becomes aware of a su spected event.
Unscheduled Visit is also to be performed in case a dose adjustment is needed.
5. The early End Of Treatment (eEOT) V isit will be required for all patients who have taken a dose of dabigatran etexilate but the study medication was discontinue d early for any 
reason (e.g. the clinical risk factor has resolved) before Visit 11. For transition recommendation from dabigatran etexilate to a non-study antithrombotic treatment see Appendix 
10.3
6. The informed consent (and if ap plicable assent) should be obtained per local legislations and guidelines from the patient’s parent(s) or legal guardian and patient (where 
applicable )before any study procedures are performed . Should patients reach legal age during the trial they must pe rsonally sign and date the informed consent form as soon as 
possible and, at the latest, at the next visit.
7. A complete physical examination is required at Visit 1, Visit 8, Visit 11 , eEOT Visit and Visit 12. At any point during the trial, a comprehensive p hysical examination should be 
performed if indicated based on the clinical presentation of the patient (reported symptoms and the findings on the basis of the vital signs). Relevant findings should be recorded 
in source notes and captured in the trial eCRF.
8. The required ECGs should be performed as noted in the flow chart , additional ECGs should be performed in cases of cardiac symptoms (example: rhythm disorders) or per PI 
judgment when medically required.
9. A pregnancy test w ill be done centrally in female adolescents of child bearing potential (subjects who have reached menarche). Menstrual period must be confirmed prior to 
inclusion in the trial. More frequent testing can be done if required by the local regulation and /or authority or per investigator judgment. Alternatively serum or urine pregnancy 
testing may be performed locally at screening , see protocol Section 5.2.3 .
10. Laboratory tests will be performed according to protocol Section 5.2. 3.

This document may not -in full or in part -be passed on, reproduced, published or oth erwise used without prior written permission.The approximate blood volumes (in ml) to be collected for planned central safety laboratory assessments and /PD are outlined in Appendix 10.1.1 . An additional blood sample
could be collected at sc reening for local measurement of INR, serum creatinine, HCT, Hb, Platelet count, ALT and AST in order to facilitate the eligibility assessment.
In case of infants and when medically required per Investigator judgment and / or per local guidelines, reduced blood collection will be implemented after consultation with the 
Sponsor (e.g. omission of exploratory coagulation markers, reduced frequency of safety labs during the treatment period, etc. ). The decision for the reduced blood collection in 
those cases will be documented in the ISF .
11. Collection of pre -dose trough  PD samples will be done as indicated in the flow chart . Pre-dose trough  PD samples should be taken at approximately 10 to 16 hours 
after the last dos e. Date and exact time of study drug administration on the three days before the sample saretaken are to be captured using patient / parent / legal guardian diary 
(must be distributed during the previous visit). Dabigatran etexilate doses must not be dela yed to accommodate a preferred pre -dose collection time point. More frequent plasma 
level evaluations may be warranted per investigator judgment for infants and in cases where the patient’s weight is expected to fluctuate in a short timeframe due to patien t age, 
physiology and other factors.
12. The appropriate dabigatran etexilate starting dose must be based on the latest age and weight -based nomogram provided in Appendix 10.4.1 . Patients who completed the treatment 
period of the 1160.106 study and who are still being treated with dabigatran etexilate may continue taking the same dose also in this trial.
13. This assessment will be completed by the patient (if old enough per investigator judgment) or by the parent / legal guardian. Theaim of this evaluation will be to obtain additional 
information about the experience of taking dabigatran etexilate as capsules, pellets ororalliquid formulation (reconstituted with flavoured or unflavoured solvent) .The 
assessment should be preferably completed by the same person at all defined time points.

1.1 MEDICAL BACKGROUND
In contrast to adults, venous thromboembolism (VTE) in children is a rare event with an 
overall annual incidence of approximately  0.07- 0.14 events per 10,000 children ( R06-2301). 
Nevertheless it represents a significant management challenge that requires therapeutic 
intervention ( R06-2301, R06- 2150 , R07-2959). The most common etiologic factor for VTE 
in children is the presence of a central venous line (CVL) ( R06-2305 , R06-2150 ). Immediate 
complications of VTE include death from pulmonary  embolism (PE) and non -lethal PE. 
Long -term complications involve recurrent VTE, post -thrombotic sy ndrome (PTS), and 
bleeding associated with anticoagulation therap y (R07-2959, R07 - 29 54, R07-2962 , R06-
2305 ). 
The recommendations on antithrombotic therap y in children are based on extrapolation of 
adult data from randomized controlled studies or on small randomized or non -contr olled 
studies in children ( P98-11480, R07 - 2940 ). The current standard of care (SOC) for the 
treatment of VTE in children is unfractionated heparin (UFH) or low molecular weight 
heparin (LMWH) adm inistered for generally  5 to 7 day s followed by  3 to 6 months of 
LMWH or vitamin K antagonists (VKA s) (R07-2939 ). 
There are frequent challenges with the use of UFH and oral anticoagulants ( OAC )in children 
(P06-06652, R07 - 2938 , R07 -2956 ). For UFH, these include variable pharmacokinetics, need 
for venous access for both administration and monitoring and heparin -induced 
thrombocy topenia. F or VKA, problematic issues with dosing include the significant 
influences of age, diet, medications and underly ing diseases, which result in a need for 
frequent monitoring ( R07-2964 ). Low molecular weight heparin has several p otential 
advantages in children over UFH/VKAs for the treatment of VTE, which has prompted it 
becoming the preferred product in children despite the lack of adequate and well -controlled 
clinical trials. However, the use of LMWH requires subcutaneous administration with a 
needle poke causing pain in the child and anxiety  for the parent or guardian which may  
translate into non -
compliance. These problems with conventional anticoagulation provide the 
rationale for investigations of novel anticoagulants. 
An ope n-label multicentre randomized study  (the REVIVE study ) comparing the efficacy  and 
safet y of a low molecular weight heparin (reviparin -sodium) to UFH/VKA for the treatment 
of VTE in children, showed that at 3 months post- therap y, 2/36 patients (5.6%) treat ed with 
reviparin -sodium had recurrent VTE or death compared to 4/40 patients (10.0%) receiving 
UFH/VKA (odds ratio = 0.53; 95% CI=(0.05, 4.00); Fisher’s exact test: 2P= 0.677). There 
were 7 major bleeds reported, 2/36 (5.6%) in the reviparin -sodium group and 5/40 (12.5%) in 
UFH/VKA group (odds ratio = 0.41; 95% confidence interval 0.04, 2.76); Fisher’s exact test: 
P=0.435). There were 5 deaths reported during the study  period, 1 (2.8%) in the reviparin -
sodium group and 4 (10.0%) in the UFH/VKA group. All f ive deaths were considered 
unrelated to VTE but one was due to an intracranial haemorrhage in the UFH/VKA group. 
Due to challenges with patient recruitment , REVIVE was closed prematurely . The REVIVE 
study  provides valuable information on the incidence of r ecurrent VTE, major bleeding and 
problematic issues associated with therap y of VTE in children ( R06-2304).

This document may not -in full or in part -be passed on, reproduced, published or oth erwise used without prior written permission.Paediatric VTE has a significant impact on both immediate and long -term health outcomes 
(R13-4251, P94 - 81556; R12- 5109 ). There are two major consequences of VTE that could 
affect the long -term health status: recurrence of VTE and post -thrombotic sy ndrome (PTS). 
The risk of recurrent VTE in children is estimated to be approximately  5-10%. However the 
risk may  be even higher in patients with one or more persisting 
risk factors (e.g. central 
venous line (CVL), chronic disease, thrombophilia, etc.) (R07-2936; P09- 03357; P12- 03887). 
Data from a recent survey  conducted in the USA suggested that approximately  14% of 
children develop recurrent VTE with the likelihood of recurrence being the highest in 
adolescent group (19%) ( R13-4251). The incidence of clinicall y significant childhood PTS is 
estimated to be 10% ( P09-03357). Up to date, there are no randomized controlled trials that 
investigate secondary  VTE prevention in paediatric patients.
In a prospective cohort study  conducted by   and colleagues at the Hospital for Sick 
Children (Canada), the use of LMWH for treatment and prevention was evaluated in a cohort 
of 173 patients.  There were 1 46 courses of LMWH administered for treatment and 30 
courses for proph ylaxis of VTE ( R14-1031 ). Of the 30 patients who received prophy lactic 
doses of LMWH, 11 (3 7%) patients received LMWH for the prevention of CVL -related 
thro
mbosis. Of these 30 patients who received prophy lactic doses of LMWH, one (3. 3%) 
patients had sy mptomatic recurrence of V TE, and died due to extension of old VTE and 
coronary  heart disease . There were no major bleeds. 
In another long
-term safety  and effic acy prospective cohort study  conducted by  Schobess and 
colleagues, 80 children aged > 3 months to < 18 years  diagnosed with DVT were 
consecutivel y recruited to be treated with a LMWH and stratified to once -daily  or twice -daily  
enoxaparin administration, with median treatment duration of 4- 5 months ( R14-1032). The 
median follow -up time was 24 months, during the follow -up period 6.3% of children 
developed PTS and 5% developed recurrent DVT. 
A Canadian Paediatric Registry  follow ed 137 consecutive paediatric VTE patients from 6 
months to up to 3 y ears(P94-81556) . The registry reported that out of 137 patients, 2.2% 
died as a direct result of thrombotic complications, 18.5% developed recurrent VTE or PE, of 
which 70% occurred on anticoagulation therap y. In addition, 21% had evidence of post-
thrombotic syndrome.
In summary , patients who suffered from VTE may  remain at risk for recurrent thrombosis
and thromboembolism after completion of initial anticoagulation treatment course, especiall y 
those with CVL , prothrombotic risk factors, etc. Long- term DVT consequences (e.g. post -
thrombotic sy ndrome) are important causes of morbidity  and mortalit y in children and require 
further investigation.
1.2 DRUG PROFIL E
Dabigatran etexilate (BIBR 1048) is an oral pro -drug of the active direct thrombin inhibitor
dabigatran (BIBR 953). Dabigatran is a low molecular weight, reversible thrombin inhibitor, 
which binds to thrombin with a high affinity  and specificit y. Dabigat ran inhibits free 
thrombin, fibrin- bound thrombin and thrombin-induced platelet aggregation. The pro -drug 
itself has no anticoagulant activity .

This document may not -in full or in part -be passed on, reproduced, published or oth erwise used without prior written permission.The efficacy  and safet y of dabigatran etexilate have been evaluated in Phase III trials that 
involved over 38,00 0 adult patients, thereof more than 23,350 dabigatran patients were 
investigated.
These trials investigated primary  VTE prevention after hip and knee surgery , acute VTE 
treatment (aVTEt), secondary  VTE prevention (sVTEp) and stroke prevention in atrial 
fibrillation ( P09-11669).
The aVTEt adult study  program with RE -COVER (1160.53, U09-1400 -01) and RE -COVER 
II (1160.46, U11-2298- 01) and the two sVTEp studies (RE -MEDY: 1160.47, U10-2533-01
and RE -SONATE: 1160.63, U11-2267-02) have been completed.
Dabigatran etexilate is approved for prevention of VTE following total hip or knee 
replacement surgery  and for pre vention of stroke and sy stemic embolism in patients with 
atrial fibrillation. A t the time this protocol was written, a pproval wa s still pending for aVTEt 
and sVTEp in major markets.
For full details on drug profile, please refer to the latest version of th e Investigator’s Brochure 
(IB) (U98-3208 ).
PK/PD data from adult studies:
Dabigatran is a potent, competitive, reversible direct thrombin inhibitor. I t inhibits 
thrombin- dependent conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin, thus prev enting the formation of 
thrombi. 
The clinical pharmacology  study  program of dabigatran etexilate is comprised of more than 
45individual Phase I studies and the collection of pharmacokinetic and pharmacody namic 
data from seven Phase II studies and four Phase III studies (RE -LY, RE -NOVATE, RE-
NOVATE -
2, and RE -COVER).  
Overall, dabigatran plasma concentration increased proportional to the increasing oral dose of 
the prodrug dabigatran etexilate and there was no time or dose dependency  in dabigatran 
distribu tion and elimination indicating linear pharmacokinetics ( U09-2262-01).
The pharmacokinetic profile of dabigatran is characterized by  maximum plasma 
concentrations at approximately  2 hours after oral administration, a bi -expon ential 
distribution phase and a terminal half -life of 11- 17 hours in y oung ( U06-1614 -01, U00 - 1856) 
and 12 - 13 hours in elderly  healthy  volunteers ( U03-1878), respective ly.
Steady  state is generally  attained by  the third day  of treatment with dabigatran etexilate 
administered b.i.d. 
There is a clear relationship between dabigatran plasma concentrations and its 
pharmacod ynamic effects (e.g. changes in ecarin clotting time (ECT), thrombin time (TT), 
diluted thrombin time (dTT), and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT)) in all 
populations studied, resulting in reproducible dose -dependent prolongation in clotting times 
with rapid onset and offset of these effects. T hePK/PD (i.e. prolongation of coagulation

affected b y age, sex, or co -medication ( U09-1399-02).  
In the RE -LY stud y (U09-3249-02 ), a relationship between total dabigatran exposure and 
efficacy  (i.e. ischemic stroke) has been established; a total dabigatran trough concentration 
above 50 ng/mL  was associated with appropriate efficacy  for the prevention of stroke and 
even lower concentrations appeared to provide benefit . In the RE -COVER study , the 
correlation between efficacy  and total dabigatran trough concentration was weak. Efficacy  
could be considered as adequate at concentrations above the 10thpercentile (26ng/mL )of the 
trough concentrations observed in RE -COVER. Based on the anticipated similarity  of the 
pathophy siology  of thrombotic events in the populations of these two trials , a trough 
concentration ≥ 50 ng/mL is expected to provide the most favourable efficacy  and is therefore 
proposed for paediatric patients in this trial. Furthermore, based on a low risk of major 
bleeding events with rising total dabigatran trough concentrations even beyond 250 ng/mL, it 
is therefore considered that maintaining a trou gh concentration between 50 and < 250 ng/mL  
as planned in this study , has a reasonable likelihood to be effective, safe and thus have a 
positive benefit /risk ratio in children of all ages.
A Phase I study (1160.87) was conducted in 30 healthy adult volun teers to investigate the 
relative bioavailabilit y of single doses of two formulations: reconstituted solution from 
powder and pellets sprinkled on food in comparison to the standard adult capsule formulation 
(U09-1839-01). Th e two test formulations (pellets and solution reconstituted from powder) 
had a significantl y higher relative bioavailabilit y compared to the reference capsule 
formulation. The average treatment ratio for the comparison between solution reconstituted 
from powder and capsules were 154.8 % and 166.6 % for AUC 0-∞and Cmax, respectively . 
The corresponding 90% confidence intervals for the ratios of AUC 0-∞and Cmax were 127.4 
% to 188.2 % and 133.2 % to 208.3 %, respectively . The average treatment ratio for the 
comparison between pellets and capsules were 175.1 % and 186.9 % for AUC 0-∞and Cmax, 
respectivel y. The corresponding 90% confidence intervals for the ratios of AUC 0-∞and Cmax 
were 141.9 % to 216.1 % and 147.7 % to 236.7 %, respectivel y. 
Another larger phase I study  (1160.194; 54 healthy  subjects ) further examined the 
bioavailability  of stead y-state dabigatran etexilate as pellets on food and dabigatran etexilate 
as granules resolved in reconstitution solution in healthy adult volunteers ( c02248557 ). The 
examined test formulat ions resulted in a higher average relative bioavailability  compared 
with the dabigatran etexilate as hard capsule reference formulation (30% for DE as granules 
resolved in reconstitution solution , and 37% for DE as pellets on food ). However, individual 
Cmax,ssand AUC τ,ssvalues observed for the 3 formulations were within the range of exposure 
seen with previous dabigatran studies using capsules and reconstitution solution. The increase 
in exposure is considered small enough to consider the formulations int erchangeable. 
Furthermore, trough levels were similar for the 3 formulations. Based on the results of this 
study , no conversion factor needs to be applied for dosing purposes in children.

It is worth mentioning that the goal of the dosing algorithm is to reach the pre -defined target 
exposure for dabigatran (i.e. a trough plasma concentration of 50- 250 ng/mL) . This will be 
achieved b y dose adjustments based on pla sma level measurements in steady  state. 
PK/PD in- vitro paediatric data:
Prior to administering dabigatran etexilate to an y children, its activity  was assessed in the 
plasma of children ex vivo to determine whether there were an y age -dependent differences in 
the effects of dabigatran on the haemostatic s ystem of children of different ages ( P08-09073). 
Cord blood and blood samples were collected from 9- 11 children in each age group (0 to 
<1yr; 1 to <5 yrs.; 5 to <10 yrs.and 10 t o 16 y ears) and compared to pooled adult plasma. 
This study  demonstrated that there was no remarkable difference in the response to 
dabigatran concentrations ranging from 50 -450 ng/ml between adult and paediatric plasma 
(ages 0 -16 years) using standard coa gulation assays. The only  differences in response were 
seen with cord plasma, which was more sensitively  prolonged than children’s plasma of all 
ages and adult plasma. Both the TT and ECT were linearl y and sensitively correlated with 
dabigatran plasma conc entrations.
Evaluation of dabigatran in patients from 12 to less than 18 years of age (study 1160.88): 
Eight adolescent patients have successfull y completed the three day tr eatment safet y and 
tolerability  Phase IIa study  1160.88 as required per protocol ( U12-3378- 01) with dabigatran 
etexilate capsules. No drug-related serious adverse events or bleeds were observed in the 
1160.88 study  (U12-3378 -01). In this small population of patients, dabiga tran etexilate 
capsules were well tolerated with only  three mild and transient gastrointestinal adverse events 
reported b y two patients. The PK/PD relationship in this population was similar to the 
relationship seen in adult VTE patients; as expected, the PK/PD analy sis showed linear 
relationship with ECT and dTT.
From these data it seems justified to apply  the adapted adult population pharmacokinetic 
model to simulate total dabigatran plasma concentration -time profiles in paediatric 
populations.
Evaluation of dabigatran in patients from 1 to less than 12 years of age (study 1160.89 ): 
Eighteen patients with VTE aged from 1 to < 12 years of age were entered in a safet y and 
tolerability  Phase IIa study  (1160.89) with dabigatran etexilate oral liquid formulati on 
(c09069268
).Six patients received multiple doses ( 3 day s twice daily ) and fifteen patients 
received a single dose. The dose was adjusted according to an algorithm based on Hay ton’s 
estimation for renal function taking into account age and weight. Dabigatran etexilate oral 
liquid formulation was well tolerated, with no study  drug-related serious adverse events, no 
study  drug -related adverse events, VTE or bleeds observed. The PK/PD relationships were 
similar to those observe d in adult and adolescent patients with VTE. A linear PK/PD 
relationship was observed for ECT and dTT whereas the PK/PD relationship was non -linear 
for aPTT. The projected steady -state dabigatran trough concentrations of this study  were 
largel y comparable to those observed in adult patients with VTE .

ASSESSMENT
2.1 RATIONALE FOR PERFOR MING THE TRIAL
VTE treatment and secondary  prevention using current standard of care therapies such as 
LMWH and VKA continues to present some challenges in clinical practice. With VKA use, 
frequent INR monitoring is required due to a narrow therapeutic range which is often 
complicated b y age, changing diet, medication interactions and underlying disease. LMWH 
has several benefits in children over VKA and it is current ly considered as the preferred agent 
for paediatric VTE treatment and secondary
 prevention. However, the anxiety  that patients 
and parents often feel, which is sparked b y the requirement of subcutaneous administration, 
may lead to compliance issues. As wel l, the use of L MWH for paediatric VTE treatment and 
secondary prevention is not sufficiently  studied and characterised in well -controlled clinical 
trials. Clinical challenges observed with VKA and L MWH usage warrant the development of 
easier to use treatme nt modalities with a comparable safet y and efficacy profile to current 
standard of care treatments. Dabigatran etexilate may provide such an option.
The present stud y is a safety  trial of dabigatran etexilate for secondary prevention of VTE in 
children from 0 to less than 18 y ears of age. The design of t his study  has been agreed with the 
European Medicines Agency ’s Paediatric Committee. This study  is part of the paediatric 
dabigatran clinical development program for VTE treatment. This trial has the potenti al to 
provide critical information regarding the safet y of dabigatran etexilate for secondary 
prevention of VTE and hence help pave the way  for validation of dabigatran etexilate as a 
potential novel therap y in this indication.
2.2 TRIAL OBJECTIVES
The mai n objective of this paediatric prospective cohort study  is to assess the safet y of 
dabigatran etexilate used for secondary  prevention of venous thromboembolism in children 
from 0 to less than 18 y ears of age.
2.3
BENEFIT - RISK ASSESSMENT
Individuals parti cipating in this trial may  benefit from receiving a drug which was 
evaluated 
in preventing secondary  VTE in adult patients and demonstrated to be safe and effective in 
that population . The secondary  VTE prevention trials conducted in over 4200 adult patien ts 
demonstrated that dabigatran etexilate was non -inferior to very  well controlled warfarin (RE-
MEDY, U10-2533-01 ) and superior to placebo in preventing recurrent VTE compared to 
placebo (RE-SONATE, U11-2267-0 2).
In the RE -MEDY trial ,the primary  endpoint event (VTE or VTE- related death) occurred in 
26 patients in the dabigatran etexilate treatment group and in 18 patients in the warfarin 
group (HR 1.44 (95% CI 0.78-2.74, p = 0.0137 for non -inferiorit y)). T he frequency  of major 
bleeding event s was numerically lower for the dabigatran etexilate group (0.9%) than for the 
warfarin group (1.8%). However, this difference did not reach statistical significance (HR 
0.52 ( 95% CI 0.27 -1.02, p = 0.0577) ).
TheRE-SONATE trial demonstrated that dabigatran etexilate was superior to placebo for the

(HR 0.08 (95% CI 0.02, 0.25, p <0.0001 for superiority )).There were onl y two patients 
(0.3%) in the dabigatran etexilate treatment group, and none in the placebo group, who had 
confirmed major bleeding events (HR could not be calculated because of the absence of MBE 
events in the placebo group) . The hazard ratios comparing dabigatran etexilate to placebo for 
centrall y adjudicated clinically relevant bleeding events, measured 2.92 (95% CI , 1.52, 5.60), 
and an y bleed events, measured 1.82 for dabigatran etexilate versus placebo are 2.92 and 1.82 
(1.23, 2.68), with p values for both being <0.003.
Based on the adult VTE treatment trials ( RE-COVER and RE -COVER II ) conducted in over 
5000 patients, the incidence of major bleeding events was lower in the dabigatran arms 
relative to warfarin (hazard ratio DE/W 0.48; 95% CI  0.29 to 0.78) w ith similar efficacy ; 
primary  efficacy  endpoint hazard ratio DE/W 1.09; 95% CI  0.77- 1.53 ( U09- 1400-01 and 
U11-2298 -01). Therefore, this study  may  have the potential to provide a real therapeutic
benefit to participating patients at an individual level.
The planned study  may  also help to bring new and innovative therap y to paediatric patients 
with risk of secondary  VTE, providing a general benefit to societ y and to the paediatric 
patient population.
The tolerability  and PK/PD profile of dabigatran has been evaluated in a limited number of 
paediatric patients. Data obtained from 8 adolescent patients i
n trial 1160.88 ( U12-3378-01) 
demonstrated that dabigatran etexila te capsules were apparently  safe and well tolerated. Data 
obtained from 18 patients aged 1 to < 12 years in trial 1160.89 ( c09069268 ) and in 8 patients 
aged 0 to < 1 year in trial 1160.105 ( c09085437) demonstrated that dabigatran oral liquid 
formulation was apparently  safe and well tolerated .According to the PK data from study  
1160.89 in the age group of patients aged 1to less than 12 years, and from study  1160.105 in 
the age group of patients fr om 0 to less than 1 y ear,a dosing algorithm based on Hay ton’s 
estimation for renal function seems to be appropriate.
A twice dail y (BID) dosing nomogram was developed to achieve the steady state trough 
concentrations of dabigatran etexilate between 50 and < 250 ng/ml. Doses in the nomogram 
were estimated using a scaling method according to Hayton, which is considered applicable 
for drugs , like dabigatran etexilate, with predominantly  renal clearance (R06-2299). The 
method scale s an adult dose which is expected to result in a therapeuticall y beneficial 
exposure range down to a child’s expected renal function (which Hay ton defines based on 
age and weight). 
At the start of study  1160.10 8, the maximum daily  dose of dabigatran etexi late for patients 
with body  weight > 40 kg was capped at 440 mg (given as 220 mg twice daily ) instead of 
using actual calculated dosages in order to avoid high peak concentrations predicted with 
higher dosages in comparison to expected peak levels in a typical adult VTE patient. The 
initial experience from 5 adolescents in study  1160.106 using a capped dabigatran dose 
regimen in patients with a body  weight > 40 kg, has observed dabigatran trough 
concentrations below or close to the lower target cut- off of 5 0 ng/ml and well below the 
higher end of the target plasma range (250 ng/ml) as measured b y the Hemoclot assay . PK 
modelling has projected that the percentage of patients with trough plasma levels < 50 ng/ml

actual calculated dose will increase the probability).
With protocol version 3.0, a BID regimen using actual calculated dosages (according to 
Haytonequation ) rather than any  capped dosages has been implemented . This dosing 
regimen will also include the additional safeguard of dose up- or down -titration to achieve a 
trough plasma level of 50 to < 250 ng/m l. Dose adjustments may occur as early  as 
approximately  5 -12 day s after first medication intake based on results f romVisit 3 plasma 
level measurements. 
According to PK simulations, a BID regimen using actual calculated dosages according to 
Hayton will reduce the probability  of trough levels to be below 50 ng/ml to approx imately
18%. The probability  to have levels < 25 ng/ml with the BID uncapped regimen is projected 
to be as low as 3% , which means that exposure will most likely  be sufficient in the vast 
majority  of patients, when risk of VTE recurrence is highest (i.e. within the first 30 day s after 
the index VTE ev ent). Bas edon the experience from the adult RE -LY and RE -COVER 
studies dabigatran levels between 25 and 50 ng/mL may  still be considered adequate. 
In selected patients receiving single dosages greater than 220 mg BID (i.e. up to 330 mg 
single dose at max imum) in an uncapped regimen, peak levels are projected to be higher than 
those predicted for the t ypical adult patient in VTE study  RE-COVER. Higher peak levels 
correspond to high trough levels, for which a down
-titration of the dose will occur early in 
the trial (i.e. after approximately  5-12 day s ), if the trough level is > 250 ng/ml.
According to the literature, the risk of bleeding tends to be in general lower in children than 
in adults ( R12-0738; P10- 09826 ). In paediatric studies, the rate of major bleeding reported 
while receiving anticoagulant medication ranged from 0.5% -1.7% of patients ( R12-0738), 
whereas major bleeding rates in adult patients requiring oral anticoagulant therap y range from 
1.3% to 8.3% per year (P04-10723). The proposed BID dosing regimen for dabigatran also 
appears favourable in comparison to the current standard of treatment with Vitamin K 
antagonists (VKAs). With VKAs, the risk of not being within the therapeutic INR range has 
been reported to be much higher than with this proposed dabigatran dosing regimen: 
published studies describe a mean or median time in therapeutic range between 39% and 
81.7% ( R12-0738), which means that patients are under -or overdosed for up to 60% of the 
time with VKA treatment. 
A BID regimen with removal of capping (up to a dose of 330 mg BID) is considered 
favourable . In addition, risks associated with this regimen resulting from low exposure have 
been projected to be uncommon. Potential risks associated with higher trough exposure are 
transient and considered acceptable in a paediatric population in the context of less 
favourable treatment alternatives , specificall y when comparing to the large percentage of 
time out of the therapeutic range with the current standard of care treatment (VKAs). 
In summary , the bleeding risk in the paediatric patient population is considered to be lower 
than that in adult populations (e.g. in the adult SPAF and VTE indications). Based on an 
overall benefit -
risk assessment including the fact that the risk of thrombotic events is highest

acceptable.
The efficacy  and safet y profile of dabigatran etexilate in paediatric patients as well as the 
appropriateness of proposed dosing algorithm will be evaluated in the phase IIb/III 1160.106 
trial. The data will be closely  monitored b y an independent Data Monitoring Committee 
(DMC), which will also be utilized to monitor participants' safet y during this trial.
The study  recruitment will be done similar to that in the 1160.106 trial.  The recruitment will 
be initiated in adolescent patients first (12 to < 18 y rs.) and consecutivel y opened to the next 
age group ( 2yrsto < 12 y rs.) and then to y oungest patients (0 to < 2yrs.) based on DMC 
recommendations that take into account information from the current age group in this trial 
and the 1160.106 trial , as well as data from other dabigatran etexilate paediatric studies .This 
approach ensures that the y ounger age groups will only  be evaluated after the dosing 
algorithm is confirmed , age -appropriate formulations are available, and preliminary  PK, PD, 
effica cy and safet y data are obtained from older age group(s) from this trial, the 1160.106 trial 
and other phase IIa studies. These measures are expected to provide adequate safety  
protection for all stud y participants.
A specific reversal agent
antagonising the pharmacody namic effect of dabigatran in children
is not available y et; however, a development program is ongoing (P15-06362 ) .
As protein binding is low, dabigatran is dialyzable,however ,there is limited clinical 
experience in using dial ysis in this setting. Clearance of dabigatran b y haemodialy sis was 
investigated in patients with end- stage renal disease. Dial ysis was conducted with 700 
mL/min dialy sate flow rate, four hour duration, a blood flow rate of either 200 mL /min o r 
350-390 mL /min. This resulted in a removal of 50% or 60% of free - or total dabigatran 
concentrations, respectively . The amount of drug cleared by  dialysis is proportional to the 
blood flow rate.
Although dabigatran etexilate treatment was not associated with an y increase in drug -induced 
liver injury  (DILI) in adults, DILI is under constant surveillance by  sponsors and regulators. 
Therefore, as in all Boehringer -Ingelheim sponsored studies, this study  requires timely  
detection, evaluation, and follow up of laboratory alterations of selected liver laboratory  
parameters to monitor patient safet y.
Overall, dabigatran etexilate may  reduce the need for frequent blood samples for therapeutic 
drug monitoring as is the case with currentl y available oral anticoagulants (VKAs) . This 
study  has the potential to offer to the participating subjects close medical care and an 
alternative therap y which has been evaluated in adults and demonstrated to be safe and 
effective , hence potentially  providing an alternative therapeut ic 
option for secondary  VTE 
prevention in the paediatric patient population.

3.1 OVERALL TRIAL DESIGN AND PLAN
This is a multi -centr e, multinational, open -label, single arm prospective cohort study  of 
dabigatra n etexilate to evaluate safet y in the secondary  prevention of venous 
thromboembolism in children from 0 to less than 18 y ears. This study  is planned to be 
conducted in approximately  100 sites located worldwide .
After a signed consent form (and assent, if a pplicable) has been obtained and if all eligibility  
criteria are met, patients will initiate or continue treatment with dabigatran etexilate (Visit 2).
Detailed guidance on how to switch from standard VTE treatment to dabigatran etexilate is
provided in Section 4.1.4.
Patients will be treated with dabigatran etexilate until the clinical risk factor requiring 
secondary  VTE prevention has resolved, or up to a maximum of 12 months. The clinical risk 
factor must be specified at scre ening and evaluated at every  visit. At the end of the study  all 
patients need to discontinue dabigatran etexilate, or switch to standard of care, if there is 
continued need for anticoagulant treatment (see Appendix 10.3 ) .
Please refer to Section 4.1.3 for information on dose selection.
Study  visits and procedures will be performed as outlined in the Flow Chart . Collection and 
processing of PD samples is described in Section 5.7.2 . 
All patients who have taken dabigatran etexilate will have a follow -up period of 28 day s after 
terminati on of trial medication (Visit 11 ). Subject participation is concluded when the 
Follow -up V isit is completed.
Patients who stop study  treatment earlier than 12 months (risk factor resolved
orearly 
treatment discontinuation) will be asked to perform an eEOT Visit and will be followed up 
according to the remaining visit schedule until the end of the study. Prior to entering the trial , 
patients and their 
parents /legal guardians will be made aware of this requirement.
The end of the trial is defined as “last subject out”, i.e. last visit completed by  the last subject.
3.1.1 Administrative structure of the trial

recommendations to continue, modify  or termin ate the study  per the Charter. The DMC will 
review s tudy results as well as monitor the overall paediatric program results to ensure patient 
safet y. The DMC will recommend whether (and when) it is appropriate to open the trial to 
younger age groups (from 2to <12 y ears of age and then 0 to < 2yearsof age) based on 
available safet y and efficacy data from this trial and the 1160.106 trial including but not 
limited to PK and PD analy ses, dose adjustment data; exposure -
response model updated with 
all relevant paediatric and adult data and the appropriateness of dosing algorithm for 
consecutive age groups. The DMC may  implement a partial release of the y oungest age group 
(0 to <2 years of age) depending on the availability of PK/PD data from respective age 
groups studied in the phase IIa studies.
In addition , the DMC will recommend modifications of the target dabigatran plasma 
concentration range , if required, based on available data from 1160.106 trial . The dose 
regimen will be reviewed on an ongoing basis by  the committee and can be further revised as

other procedure regarded as major surgery  per investigator judgment. In general, 
major surg eryinvolves the opening of a mesenchy mal barrier (pleural cavity , 
peritoneum, meninges). Removal or insertion of a central venous line is not 
considered a major surgery provided haemostasis is achieved after the procedure
c.Any major planned procedure that might put the patient at an increased risk of a

disease, ha emophilia A or B or other hereditary  bleeding disorder, history  of 
spontaneous intra -articular bleeding, history  of prolonged bleeding after surgery /
intervention)
h.Administration of a fib rinoly tic agents within 48 hours of dabigatran etexilate 
administration (Please note the following exception: use of tissue plasminogen 
activator (t -PA) e.g. alteplase, or any  other thromboly tic agents to re -establish

2Patients with history of asymptomatic petechial or microbleeds may be included into the study as per 
investigator`s judgment. As a general recommendation, an intrac ranial microbleed is considered to be  ≤0.5 
cm in greatest diameter on gradient recalled echo (GRE), or T2* MRI sequences (criteria may vary 
depending on MRI imaging modalities; R15-2999). Irrespective of size, any cerebral bl eedthat causes focal 
neurologic symptoms and/or signs does not constitute a microbleed . Further, any blood visualized on a CT 
should be classified as a macrobleed, which is an exclusion criterion for the trial.

4.1.2 Method of assigning patient s to treatment groups
After obtaining signed informed consent and if applicable assent, patients should complete 
the screening ( Visit 1) p rocedures and laboratory  assessments. Inclusion and exclusion 
criteria should be assessed to ensure inclusion of eligible patients. The unresolved clinical 
risk factor requiring longer duration anticoagulation for the secondary  prevention of VTE 
must be sp ecified at screening (e.g. central venous line).
All e ligible patients who fulfil all inclusion and exclusion criteria will be assigned to receive 
dabigatran etexilate . Patients assigned to OLF will be randomized based on 1:1 ratio to 
receive flavoured or unflavoured solvent for reconstitution. The correct trial medication kit 
assignment will be managed b y Interactive Response Technology  (IRT
)based on the 
estimated dose -see Section 4.1.3 . All necessary  instructions for using the IRT s ystem will be 
described in a user guide /manual, a cop y of which will be available in the ISF. In this trial, 
IRT will be used for medication assignments (including dose adjustments) and to control 
aspects of the medication supply  chain.
Recruitm ent will firstbe initiated in the adolescent group ( 12yrs. to <18 yrs.) and may  be 
consecutivel y opened to younger age groups ( 2to <12 y ears of age ); and then to the y oungest 
patients (0 to < 2yrs.) based on the DMC recommendations.
4.1.3 Selection of d oses in thetrial
Estimated doses for paediatric patients assigned to take dabigatran etexilate will be based on 
age and weight according to a nomogram (please refer to 
Appendix 10.4). Patients able to 
swallow capsules (aged ≥ 8 y ears) will be assigned to take capsules. If a patient aged ≥ 8

pellets sprinkled on food . Patients < 8 y ears of age are scheduled to receive pellets s prinkled 
on food. OLF m ay be used for patients who are < 12 months of age .For patients < 12 months 
of age OLF is preferred over pellets provided that OLF supplies are available to the site.
Switching between different dabigatran etexilate formulations dur ing the study  is not 
recommended, but could be considered in special cases following discussion with the 
Sponsor , provided that thestead y state has been reached with the currently assigned 
formulation (i.e. at least 6 consecutive dabigatran etexilate dose s have been taken)
. Atitration 
visit should be performed 3 days (6 consecutive dabigatran etexilate doses are taken) after the 
formulation switch.
The dose of dabigatran etexilate m ustbe adjusted throughout the stud y period to ensure that a 
steady  state plasma concentration between 50 and <250 ng/mL is achieved. Assigned dosing 
in this study  will be intended to target plasma dabigatran concentrations that have generall y 
been proven to be safe and effective in multiple adult populations. The dose regimen will be 
reviewed on an ongoing basis by  the DMC and can be further revised as data on trough 
dabigatran levels and safety  and efficacy  data are obtained. 
Dose selection is based on dabigatran’s linear PK ( U09-2262 -01) and ren al function 
(glomerular filtration rate (GFR)) being the most important determinants of dabigatran PK.
Allometric models are considered appropriate in determining drug doses in paediatrics (R08-
4306 ). In order to adjust for the on average lower body  weight and hence lower absolute 
glomerular filtration rate in children aged below 1 y ear, the dose estimation procedure 
according to Hay ton (R06-2299) seems appropriate. Hay ton’s model characterized th e 
maturation and growth of renal function parameters based on data obtained from 63 healthy  
children between the ages of 2 day s and 12 years.
For renall y eliminated drugs like dabigatran, this model can be used to estimate dosing 
regimens based on the adul t dose and adjusted to the age and weight of the child. I n this way , 
doses and resulting nomograms can be used in clinical practice without the need for regular 
laboratory  measurements.
Compared to the adult VTE study  RECOVER (mean age 55.0), the general paediatric
population is characterized by better renal function. To y ield total dabigatran exposure at 
trough comparable to the trough exposure observed in the adult VTE program (i.e. 
RECOVER: dose 150 mg BID) and to be able to scale down the doses for the paediatric
population within the confines of Hay ton’s model (i.e., GFR predictions up to age of 20 
years, at which normal GFR is assumed to be 136 mL /min), a 20 year old adult reference 
patient weighing 70 kg was chosen. Since this reference patient is y ounger and has a higher 
dabigatran clearance due to the better renal function, the dose of 150 mg BID would result in 
an average trough exposure lower than the trough exposure seen in RE -COVER.
Therefore, this reference patient would receive higher dabigatra n etexilate doses, i.e. 300 mg 
dabigatran etexilate BID or 4.3 mg/kg dabigatran etexilate BID and doses are scaled down to 
paediatric doses accordingl y (fractional dose).

This document may not -in full or in part -be passed on, reproduced, published or oth erwise used without prior written permission.For the reference patient, the equation giving the fractional dose is derived by  taking the 
allometric equation for the GFR (equation 4 in R06-2299):
GFR(age,W) = 2.60 W0.662 e-0.0822*age+ 8.14 W0.662 (1 – e-0.0822*age),
and subsequentl y dividing b y weight (W) and b y the weight -adjusted GFR of the comparator , 
136mL /min / 70kg=1.94mL /min/kg. After rearranging, this results in the following equation 
for the fraction of the adult comparator mg/kg dose:
FRAC = W-0.338(4.20 – 2.85 e-0.0822*age)
FRAC = fraction of adult comparator mg/kg dose
W = weight (kg)
Age (m onths)
The FRAC was further multiplied by  4.3 mg/kg (adult comparator BID mg/kg dose) and by  
the child’s weight to obtain the absolute dose in mg. For weight groups (e.g. 5 and 6 kg) the 
average of the derived doses was used.
The derived dabigatran etexila te target doses based on Hay ton calculations are display ed in 
Table 4.1.3: 1 . Please note that Table 4.1.3: 1 does not contain information about age -
appropriate formulations and available dose s trengths. This information is given in the 
adjusted nomogram provided in Appendix 10.4.1. Dosin g ofpatients should only occur
according to the adjusted nomog ramprovided in Appendix 10.4.1.

Patients who have a total dabigatran stead y state trough concentration between 50 and < 250 
ng/mL will be advised to continue the same dose until the following visit. In case patients 
have trough concentrations at the first measurement (within first week of dosing, after 6 
consecutive doses are taken) below 50 ng/mL the dose m ustbe increased by 10 to 100%
according to the dosing nomogram. Assum ing dose proportionality , a doubling of the dose 
would, in the extreme case, not lead to trough concentration > 100 ng/mL and is, hence, 
considered appropriate. The maximal allowed dose in this study  is age and weight adjusted 
and will neither exceed a dai ly dose level of 22.2 mg/kg (dabigatran e texilate limit, based on 
excipient acceptable daily intake ) nor a single dose of 330 mg.In the higher age / bod y 
weight group this results in a maximal daily
 dose of 660 mg .Whenever a trough 
concentration is greater than or equal to 250 ng/mL, the dose m ustbe reduced b y 25to 50%. 
This dosing decision algorithm is summarized in the Table 4.1.3: 2 . For the detail eddosing 
decision algorithm please refer to Appendix 10.4.2 .

concentration
Steady State Dose Range Corresponding Action
Between 50 and < 250 ng/mL Continue on same dose
Less than 50 ng/mLDose may  be increased by  10-100%.
Maximal allowed single dose in this 
study  is 330 mg.
Greater than or equal to 250 ng/mL Dose may  be reduced by  25-50%
The reduction of a dose is not expected to result in concentrations < 75 ng/mL , but should be 
sufficient to avoid high concentration o f ≥250 ng/mL . Blood sampling to measure trough 
dabigatran concentration (derived from dTT or alternative method) will be repeated at least 3 
days (after at least 6 adjusted consecutive dabigatran etexilate doses have been taken), but no 
later than 6 day s after dose adjustment , to confirm the new dose. After dose adjustment, the 
total dabigatran trough concentration should be between 50 and <250 ng/mL .
If a patient cannot reach trough plasma concentrations between 50 and < 250 ng/mL after one
dose adjustment, they  must discontinue the study  medication .
Due to the dabigatran etexilate limit of 22.2 mg/kg/day (based on excipient acceptable daily
intake) as well as the maximal dabigatran etexilate single dose of 330 mg , up-titration will not 
be feasible in all instances. L ikewise down-titration will not be possible in all cases due to 
unavailability  of required dosages, see Appendix 10.4.2 . Affected patients have to be 
discontinued from dabigatran etexilate once the defined plasma t rough concentration between 
50 and < 250 ng/mL is not reached.
During the course of the study , the DMC can recommend further refinement of the target 
therapeutic trough steady state dabigatran concentrations based on data from ongoing 
paediatric studies or if emerging data from other dabigatran etexilate studies in other 
populations suggest that wider or narrower total dabigatran trough concentration range is 
associated with better benefit /risk ratio.
4.1.4 Drug assignment and administration of doses for each patient
At V isit 2 patients who meet all eligibility  criteria will be assigned to receive dabigatran 
etexilate (as capsules or pellets to be sprinkled on food or oral liquid formulation based on 
age and weight and ability  to swallow capsules or pellet s).
For p atients who have been treated with 
VKA, Visit 2 should take place only  if INR is < 2.3 
otherwise it should be postponed. The patient will start t he study  medication on the day of 
Visit 2 
if INR is below 2.0 or on the next day  if the INR is between 2.0 and 2.3.

medication 0 -2 hours prior to the time that the next dose of the alternate therapy  (e.g. 
LMWH) would be due, or at the time of discontinuation in case of con tinuous treatment (e.g. 
UFH ).
The estimated dosages of dabigatran etexilate (as capsules, pellets to be sprinkled on food or 
oral liquid formulation) will be based on age and weight according to a nomogram provided 
in Appendix 10.4.1. Patients who completed the treatment period of study  1160.106 receiving
dabigatran etexilate may continue taking the same dose and formulation also in this trial.
Patients aged ≥ 8 y ears will be assigned to take capsules. In case a patient aged ≥ 8 y ears but 
below 12 y ears of age is unable to take capsules (per investigator judgment) , they will be 
assigned to take pellets sprinkled on food. P atients < 8 y ears of age are scheduled to receive 
pellets sprinkled on food . OLF may be used for patients who are
< 12 months of age .For 
patients < 12 months of age OLF is preferred over pellets provided that OLF supplies are 
available to the site.
Dabigatran etexilate should be taken in the morning and in the evening, at approximately  the 
same time every  day. The capsules must not be crushed, not opened and can be taken with or 
without food. Dabigatran etexilate should be taken with a glass of water to facilitate delivery  
to the stomach. If gastrointestinal sy mptoms develop it is recommended to take dabigatran 
etexilate with a meal and/or a proton pump inhibitor according to the locally  approved 
labelling recommendations. For paediatric patients receiving dabigatran andwho suffer from 
dyspeptic s ymptoms, it should be taken into account that the local approval status as specified 
in the Prescribing Information or Product Information may  vary  between proton pump 
inhibitor s and across countries. T herefore, the local standard of car e in accordance with local 
labelling recommendations for proton pump inhibitor sshould be followed when treating 
gastrointestinal s ymptoms in paediatric patients treated with dabigatran. Alternative 
measures, such as taking dabigatran with a meal, should be considered if the local labelling 
recommendations and standard of care do not allow for the use of proton pump inhibitor sin 
certain age groups and/or individual patients .
Pellets should be mixed with food (examples may include bab y rice cereal, carrot mush, 
banana mush, strawberry jam, apple juice or apple sauce) and should be taken in its entirety  
(pellets and food) at every  dose. The volume of the OLF must be taken in its entirety  at every  
dose. The instructions for preparation of the OLF and pellets w ill be provided in the I SF. 
Younger patients must be assisted b y the parent / legal guardian or an appropriate caregiver 
to ensure that the dabigatran etexilate dose is properly  taken.
The interval between dabigatran etexilate doses should be as close to 12 hours as possible. If 
a dose of dabigatran etexilate is missed for an y reason, the forgotten dose may still be taken 
up to six hours prior to the next scheduled dose otherwise the missed dose should be omitted 
and the next dose should be taken as schedul ed. A double dose to make up for missed 
individual doses must never be taken. In addition, if a dose has onl y been taken partiall y, 
there should be no attempt toadminist era second dose at that time- point, and the next dose 
should be taken as scheduled ap proximately  12 hours later.

This document may not -in full or in part -be passed on, reproduced, published or oth erwise used without prior written permission.Patients will be treated with dabigatran etexilate until the clinical risk factor that necessitated 
further anticoagulant use has resolved, however for a maximum of 12 months. At the end of 
the study , all patients need to discontinue dabigatran etexilate, or switch to standard of care, if 
there is continued need for anticoagulant treatment (s ee Appendix 10.3 forrecommendations 
for transition to a non -study  antithrombotic treatment with earl y stud y dru g discontinuation or 
at the end of the trial).
In the event that a patient decides to discontinue dabigatran etexilate and has to be switched 
to non-study  treatment according to the local practice , the Investigator should plan this
transition taking into c onsideration the patient’s risk profil e and previous experience with
anticoagulants
. As patients have different risk profiles, optimal approaches might differ 
between patients and not all possible ap proaches can be full y outlined.
The transition plan will be up to the Investigator’s judgment based on the patient’s medical 
history  and prior therap y experience (see Appendix 10.3 for further guidance) . Close 
monitoring of the patient’s coagulation profile during the transition perio d must be 
implemented to optimize safet y. In general, dabigatran etexilate therap y should not overlap 
with other anticoagulation therap y.
Investigators should recognise that the presence of dabigatran etexilate could elevate the INR. 
Once dabigatran etexil ate has been stopped for >2 day s, the INR will better reflect the effect
of VKA therap y alone .

4.2 CONCOMITANT THERAPY, RESTRICTIONS , AND RESCUE 
TREATMENT
Any additional drugs considered necessary  for the patient’s welfare may be given at the 
discretion of the investigator and with due consideration of the information provided in this 
protocol and the IB.
Details of concomitant medication administered to the patient during th e course of the stud y 
should be recorded in the eCRF. This includes all concomitant therapies from time of patient 
screening until the patient completes follow up.
Certain concomitant therapies or surgery /intervention may  require the temporary  
discontinuation of dabigatran etexilate. Study  medication should be restarted as soon as 
safel y possible.
At the Screening Visit, the site must document details of the anticoagulant therap y given for 
the treatment of the acute VTE.
4.2.1 Rescue medication , emergency procedures, and additional treatment(s)
The Investigator is responsible for ensuring that procedures and expertise are available to 
cope with medical emergencies during the stud y (also refer to Section 5.2).
Major bleeds for patie nts on dabigatran:
If a patient experiences a major bleed, dabigatran etexilate should be stopped and the source 
of bleeding investigated and treated. This will generall y involve coagulation testing (e.g. 
activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), TT, dTT (where available), ecarin clotting time 
(ECT), platelet count), and possibly  transfusion, diagnostic procedures and /or surgical 
haemostasis.
There is currentl y no specific reversal agent commerciall y available to counteract the 
antithrombotic activity of dabigatran 
in children , however such is in development ( P15-
06362 ). If a clinical study  with specific reversal agent in paediatric patients is approved by  
the local health authorit y and ethic committees during the course of this study , instructions on 
how to use the specific reversal agent in appropriate cases or conditions and therequirement s
ofparticipation in the respective clinical studies may be provided to the investigators. In such 
cases cross reporting of lab res ults might be applied in order to limit the blood volume 
required for analy sis.
Since dabigatran is excreted predominantly  by the renal route adequate diuresis must be 
maintained. Appropriate standard treatment, e.g. surgical haemostasis as indicated and 
volume replacement should be undertaken as appropriate. In addition, consideration may  be 
given to the use of fresh frozen plasma ( P10-03790 ). As protein binding is low, dabigatran is

cleared b y dial ysis is proportional to the blood flow rate. 
There is some experimental evidence to support the role of agents such as activated 
prothrombin complex concentrates (APCC, e.g. FEIBA), recombinant Factor VIIa and three 
or four factor concentrates (Factors II, IX and X with or without Factor VII) in reversing the 
anticoagulant activit y of dabigatran. The usefulness in clinical settings has not yet been 
systematically  demonstrated. Consideration shou ld also be given to administration of platelet 
concentrates in cases where thrombocy topenia is present or long -acting antiplatelet drugs 
have been used. All s ymptomatic treatment has to be given according to the phy sician's 
judgment.

other alternative therap yfor secondary  VTE prevention after complete haemostasis has been 
achieved is at the I nvestigator discretion.
Clinically  relevant non -major bleeds or minor bleeds:
If a patient experiences a clinically  relevant non- major bleed or minor bleed, dabigatran 
etexilate may be continued, temporaril y interrupted or permanentl y discontinued, at the 
discretion of the Investigator. It is not a requirement, however, that study  drug be stopped in 
these cases.
Management of dabigatran etexilate prior to and after planned surgery :
Dabigatran etexilate Treatment Discontinuation for Elective Surgical Interventi ons
Patients on dabigatran etexilate who undergo surgery  or invasive procedures are at an
increased risk for bleeding. Therefore, surgical interventions may  require th e temporary
discontinuation of dabigatran etexilate.
Preoperative Phase: Due to an increased risk of bleeding dabigatran etexilate may  be stopped 
temporaril y, in advance of invasive or surgical procedures (U11-1642-01). If possible, 
dabigatran etexilate should be discontinued at least 24 hours before invasive or surgical 
procedures. In patients at higher risk of bleeding or in major surgery  where complete 
haemostasis may  berequired ,stopping dabigatran etexilate 2 -4 day s before surgery should be 
considered. A TT/dTT should be performed 6- 12 hours before elective surgery  and a normal 
result as defined b y the local lab should be obtained before a patient undergoes surgery.
In patients , who develop renal insufficiency  before th e surgery ,the recommendations 
summarized in the table below should be considered ( Table 4.2.1:1 ). The decision to re -start 
treatment with dabigatran etexilate after the surgery  is at the Investigator’s discretion and can
be started an y time as soon as haemostasis has been achieved .

1In addition to renal function, high risk determinants of bleeding risk include type of surgery, comorbidities (e.g. major 
cardiac, respiratory or liver disease) and concomitant use of antiplatelet therapy. The type of surgery associated with a high 
risk of bleeding includes but is not limited to cardiac surgery, neurosurgery, abdominal surgery or those involving a major 
organ. Other procedures such as spinal anesthesia may also require complete hem ostatic function.
The decision to use bridging therap y by UFH/LMWH during the peri -procedural period is 
left to the investigator's discretion and would depend on the bleeding and thrombotic risk in 
each patient.
Dabigatran etexilate Treatment discontinuat ion for Acute Surgical Interventions
If urgent surgery / acute intervention is required dabigatran etexilate should be temporar ily 
discontinued. The surgery /intervention should be delay ed at least 12 hours if possible after 
the last dabigatran etexilate dose. If surgery  cannot be delay ed there may  be an increased risk 
of bleeding. The risk of bleeding should be weighed together with the urgency of the 
intervention. L ocal h aemostasis and supportive care should be used during and after surgical 
intervention .
An elevated TT or dTT should lead the clinician to consider delay ing surgery . If the TT/dTT 
test is not available, an aPTT, though less precise than the TT, can be used.  A persistently  
prolonged thrombin time (TT or dTT) in the absence of heparin, fibri n /fibrinogen 
degradation products (e.g. with disseminated coagulation activation, sepsis, severe 
inflammation, and other conditions) or high concentrations of serum proteins (e.g. my eloma) 
suggests persistently  elevated levels of dabigatran in the blood.
If adabigatran specific reversal agent becomes available in a framework of clinical 
investigation during the conduct of this study  and the patient fulfils the criteria for inclusion, 
it could be proposed to patients who require urgent reversal of dabiga tran effects.

Dabigatran etexilate may be taken with or without food. Dabigatran etexilate hard capsules 
should preferabl y be taken with a glass of water , if feasible to facilitate delivery  to the 
stomach. If gastrointestinal sy mptoms develop it is reco mmended to take dabigatran etexilate 
with a meal and/or a proton pump inhibitor such as pantoprazole.
4.3 TREATMENT COMPLIANCE
Subjects or, ifapplicable, parents or legal guardians, will be asked to carefully complete a
daily medication intake log for dab igatran. Subjects or ,if applicable ,parents or legal 
guardians, are requested to bring this completed log and allremaining trial medication to 
every  clinic visit which they  will attend. Empty  dabigatran etexilate capsule containers, 
pellets boxes or solution vials must also be returned to the investigator’s site for compliance 
calculation and disposal
. Compliance willbe calculated using the below equation preferabl y 
based on the returned medication (completed logs may  also be used) :
Compliance (in %)  = (Actual number of dabigatran etexilate doses taken since last count / 
Planned number of dabigatran etexilate doses which should have been taken in the same 
period) X 100 
If an interruption of dabigatran etexilate was medically required this would be considered by  
reducing the number of expected doses that “should have been taken” accordingl y in the 
compliance calculation .
Unreliable subjects should not be entered in the study at the discretion of the investigator. 
Compliance during the treatment period s hould be between 80% and 120%. In cases where 
compliance is not achieved based on the above definition, the parent or legal guardian and 
when applicable the patient should be interviewed and re -informed about the purpose and the 
conduct of the trial and th e importance to maintain good compliance. If non -compliance 
persists despite all possible efforts, patients should be removed from the treatment and 
alternative therap y should be proposed in such cases.

5.2.2.1 Definitions of adverse events
Adverse event
An adverse event (AE) is defined as a ny untoward medical occurrence, including an 
exacerbation of a pre -existing condition, in a patient or clinical investigation subject who 
received a pharmaceutical product. The event does not necessaril y have to have a causal 
relationship with this treatme nt.
Serious adverse event
A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as any AE which results in death, is immediately 
life-threatening, results in persistent or significant disability  / incapacit y, requires or prolongs 
patient hospitalisation, is a congenita l anomaly  / birth defect, or is to be deemed serious for 
any other reason if it is an important medical event when based upon appropriate medical 
judgment which may  jeopardise the patient and may  require medical or surgical intervention 
to prevent one of t he other outcomes listed in the above definitions.
Intensit y of adverse event
The intensity  of the AE should be judg ed based on the following:
Mild: Awareness of sign(s) or sy mptom(s) which is /are easily  tolerated
Moderate: Enough discomfort to cause in terference with usual activity
Severe: Incapacitating or causing inability  to work or to perform usual activities
Causal relationship of adverse event
Medical judgment should be used to determine the relationship, considering all relevant 
factors, includin g pattern of reaction, temporal relationship, de -challenge or re -challenge, 
confounding factors such as concomitant medication, concomitant diseases and relevant 
history . Assessment of causal relationship should be recorded in the case report forms .
Yes: There is a reasonable causal relationship between the investigational product 
administered and the AE. 
No: There is no reasonable causal relationship between the investigational product 
administered and the AE. 
Worsening of the underly ing disease or other pre- existing conditions
Worsening of the underly ing disease or of other pre -existing conditions will be recorded as an 
(S)AE in the (e)CRF.

(i.e., from signing the informed consent until end of follow -up period ) will be collected, 
documented and reported to the S ponsor by  the investigator on the appropriate CRF(s)/ 
eCRFs/SAE reporting forms. The investigator does not need to activel y monitor patients for 
adverse events once the clinical trial has ended. However, if the investigator becomes aware 
of an SAE(s) that occurred after the patient has completed the clinical trial (including any  
protocol required residual effect period ( REP)and / or follow -up), it should be reported b y 
the investigator to the Sponsor if considered relevant by  the investigator. Report ing will be 
done according to the specific definitions and instructions detailed in the ‘Adverse Event 
Reporting’ section of the Investigator Site File.
The residual effect period (REP) for dabigatran is 3days after last drug administration. 
Therefore all AEs reported within 3days of the last trial medication will be considered on 
treatment. All AEs, including those persisting after trial completion must be followed up until 
they have resolved or have been sufficientl y characterized. 
For each adverse eve nt, the investigator will provide the onset date, end date, intensity , 
treatment required, outcome, seriousness, and action taken with the investigational drug. The 
investigator will determine the relationship of the investigational drug to all AEs as defi ned in 
Section 5.2.2.1.
The investigator must report the following events using paper process SAE form via 
telephone /fax immediately  (within 24 hours) to the Sponsor: SAEs, AESIs and non -serious 
AEs relevant to the SAE and /or AESI.

This document may not -in full or in part -be passed on, reproduced, published or oth erwise used without prior written permission.BI has set up a list of AEs which are defined to be alway s serious. In order to support the 
investigator with the identification of these “always serious adverse events”, if a non-serious
AE is identified to be serious per BI definition, a query  will be raised. The investigator must 
verify  the description and seriousness of the event.  I f the event description is correct, the 
item “serious” needs to be ticked and an SAE has to be reported in expedited fashion 
following the same procedure as above.
The list of these adverse events can be found via the RDC -system.
The SAE form is to be forwarded to the defined unique entry  point identified for the BI OPU 
(country -specific contact details will be provided in the I nvestigator Site File). This 
immediate report is required irrespective of whether the investigational product has been 
administered or not and irrespective of causal relationship. I t also applies if new information 
to existing SAEs or protocol- specified AESI becomes avai lable.

In rar e cases, pregnancy  might occur in clinical trials. Once a female subject has been 
enrolled into the clinical trial, after having taken study  medication, the investigator must 
report immediatel y any drug exposure during pregnancy to the Sponsor. Drug exposure 
during pregnancy  has to be reported immediately  (within 24 hours) to the defined unique 
entry  point for SAE forms of the respective BI 
operative unit (country -specific contact details 
will be provided in the Investigator Site File). The outcome of the p regnancy associated with 
the drug exposure during pregnancy  must be followed up. In the absence of an (S)AE, onl y 
the Pregnancy  Monitoring Form for Clinical Trials and not the SAE form is to be completed. 
The I SF will contain the Pregnancy  Monitoring Form for Clinical Trials (Part A and Part B).
5.2.3 Assessment of safety laboratory parameters
A central laboratory  will be used for the anal ysis of all laboratory  measurements with the 
exception of serum or urine pregnancy  test, INR, serum creatinine, HCT, Hb, Platelet count, 
ALT and AST measurement
at screening (if applicable) which may  be done locally to 
facilitate the eligibility  assessment . If needed and when feasible a local laboratory  may  
alternatively be used for dTT testing to evaluat e dabigatran concen tration .Local lab 
assessments are also acceptable in emergency  situations (e.g. bleeding event or emergency  
surgery ), see Appendix 10.1.
Refer to the Flow Chart and Sectio n 5.7.2 for additional information.
For patients who have completed the treatment period of study  1160.106, the lab results from 
Visit 8 will be taken as Visit 1 or V isit 2 results ofthis trial , depending on the day  Visit 1 and 
Visit 2 take place in corr elation to Visit 8 of 
study  1160.106 (see Flow Chart , Footnotes 1 and 
2).
A centralized serum pregnancy  test for females who have reached menarche will be done as 
noted in the Flow Chart.
5.2.4 Electrocardiogram
An ECG will b
e done at screening and all other time points as noted in the Flow Chart. 
Documentation of, and findings from ECGs, must be part of the source documents available 
at the site. 
Printed paper tracings from 12- lead ECGs (I, II, III, aVR, aVL, aVF, V1 -V6) wil l be 
collected and stored at the site. In the event of an y cardiac s ymptoms or ECG abnormalities 
(i.e. heart rh ythm disorders, PR prolongation, QRS enlargement, QT prolongation, etc.),
additional ECGs will be recorded at investigator discretion. All ECGs w ill be evaluated 
(signed, dated and commented upon) b y the treating ph ysician / investigator and stored 
locally . Any clinically  relevant changes (according to investigators judgment) in the ECG 
will be reported as AEs and followed up and / or treated local ly until a normal or stable 
condition if feasible is achieved.

5.7 PHARMACODYNAMICS
5.7.1 Pharmacodynamic endpoints
Determination of the exploratory  pharmacod ynam ic 
parameters dTT (Anti -Factor IIa 
activity ), aPTT and ECT will be performed in this trial. Dilut ed thrombin time (dTT) or 
alternative registered method / assay  (where available and after consul tation of the Sponsor) 
will be employ ed for the quantitative measurement of dabigatran concentrations for dose 
adjustment . The anal ysis of dTT will be done by  a central laboratory . Diluted TT may  also be 
analysedby a local laboratory , if feasible . The dabigatran etexilate dose administered to 
patients may  be adjusted upon dab
igatran plasma level measurement from Visit 3 or other 
future visits as needed to achieve the target plasma range , based on the assessment of 
dabigatran plasma levels. Further ,alternative coagulation assay s for dabigatran, e.g. ecarin 
based tests, may  be explored.
5.7.2 Methods of sample collection
About 22.8 mL of blood (approximately  2.4mL per sampling time point) in total per patient 
assigned to dabigatran etexilate is planned for collection for the PD samples.
The collection time point for aPTT, ECT and dTT (Anti -Factor IIa activity )(or alternative 
method) are indicated in the Flow Chart . The date and exact clock time of when these PD 
samples are taken is to be recorded in the eCRF. Further, the date and the exact clock time of 
dabigatran etexilate administration on the three days before the PD samples are taken is to be 
recorded in the eCRF. The PD samples should be taken immediatel y after the PK samples 
have been obtained. To ensure correct identification and trackin
g of the PD samples, all 
sample tubes will be labelled with trial number, patient number and day  and exact time of 
sample collection.

6.1 VISIT SCHEDULE
The trial consists of three p eriods, a screening period, an open -label dabigatran etexilate 
treatment period and a follow -up period.
The schedule for trial visits is summarised in the study  Flow Chart including time windows 
for study  visits. All visit dates are calculated from the date of treatment assignment (Visit 2). 
In the event that visits are missed or out of sequence, subsequent visits will be planned 
according to the date of Visit 2.
6.2 DETAILS OF TRIAL PROCEDURES AT SELECTED VISIT S
No study  procedures may  be initiated prior to the patient’s parents (or legal guardian) signing 
the informed consent and the patient providing assent (if applicable) in compliance with ICH -
GCP and local legislation.
6.2.1 Screening period
For the schedule of assessme nts and procedures to be done during screening refer to the 
Flow Chart . In addition:
Document consenting procedure (and assenting if applicable) in the patient’s source file.
Record enrolment (date of patient consent) on th e enrolment log (located in the 
Investigator Site File).
For pa tients participating in study  1160.106 the S creening Visit may be conducted together 
with Visit 8 of 1160.106 trial.
6.2.2 Treatment period
Before giving the first dose of study  medication, eligibility  must be confirmed.
For the schedule of assessments and procedures during the treatment period refer to the Flow 
Chart. For information on dose selection and drug assignment and administration refer to 
Section 4.1.3 andSection 4.1.4. For details  PD sample collection and anal yses 
refer to and Section 5.7 .
Visit 3 is not applicable for patients who have previously  complete d the treatment period of 
the 1160.106 study  being on dabigatran etexilate and continue taking the same dose in this 
trial. For all other patients ,during Visit 3 the trough dabigatran concentration will be
determined
 
 ensure maintenance within 
a 50 to <250 ng/mL  window. If tar get exposure of 50 to <250 ng/mL  is not achieved an 
Unscheduled Visit must be performed in order to adjust the dabigatran etexilate dose (refer to

(or 6 new doses have been taken) after a dose adjustment to reassess if the new trough 
dabigatran concentration is within the target range. Patients must not be dosed at home prior 
to attending a Titration Visit; dosing will be done after a tr ough plasma sample is collected. If 
patients cannot reach trough plasma concentrations between 50 and <250 ng/mL after one
dose adjustment, they  must discontinue the study  medication.
Unscheduled Visits are to be conducted in all cases of suspected recurr ent VTE, paradoxical 
embolism (PDE), occurrence of post -thrombotic sy ndrome (PTS), major or clinically -
relevant bleeding events (MBEs/CRBEs) or other suspected AESI or SAE. The Unscheduled 
Visit should be performed as soon as possible, preferabl y within 24 hours after the site first 
becomes aware of a suspected event .
6.2.3 End of trial and follow -upperiod
Follow -up Visit should be planned for 28 day s after last drug intake. For the assessments and 
procedures to be done during the Follow -up V isit refer to the Flow Chart .
All patients who prematurely  discontinue treatment will be invited to perform an eEOT Visit .
Subsequently  they will be followed up according to the remaining visit schedule until the end 
of the study . At the se visits collection of AEs, outcome events (e.g. occurrence of PTS, VTE, 
bleeding events, etc.) and use of concomitant medication will be made. 
Patients that are not actively  taking study  drug and their parent/legal guardian may  be less 
motivated to adhe re to the study  visit schedul e. Investigator and site staff should work to 
detect earl y signs of losing interest and readily present such patients (not actively taking 
study  drug) and their parent/legal guardian with the following opportunities to encourag e 
continued participation:
continue to attend regularly  scheduled study  visits until the trial ends
conduct only  the final visit in person. All other visits would be done over the phone.  
conduct all remaining study  visits over the phone 
discontinue part icipation in remaining trial activities but permit collection of vital status 
and outcome events at the end of the trial.
discontinue participation in remaining trial activities but permit collection of vital status 
at the end of the trial.
The patient / parent /legal guardian will be asked to choose the most rigorous follow -up they  
are willing to comply  with.
For patients who completely  withdraw consent no more data on their medical information 
will b e requested . 
The site must make periodic documented at tempts (approximately  every  three months) to 
locate patients who are lost to follow up (L
TFU) .

SAMPLE SIZE
7.1 STATISTICAL DESIGN - MODEL
This trial has a single treatment group with no control group. Overall assessment of safet y 
will be based on descriptive statistics.
7.2 NULL AND ALTERNATIVE HYPOTHESES
There is no h ypothesis testing for this trial.
7.3 PLANNED ANALYSES
The primary  anal ysis will include patients who were dispensed stud y medication and have 
recei ved at leas
t one dose of study  medication (Treated set ).
The anal ysis of the /PD parameters will be performed on Pharmacokinetic s et (PKS) . PKS
will include all treated patients with at least one 
/PD measurement and having no protocol 
violations relev ant to the evaluation of  PD endpoints.
7.3.1 Primary analyses
The primary  anal yses will be based on the primary safet y endpoint s. The recurrence of VTE, 
major bleed ingevents, minor (including clinically  relevant non
-major (CRNM)) bleeding 
events, overall mortality  and mortality  related to thromboembolic events will be analy sed as 
time-to-event and will be summarized by  Kaplan- Meier estimate s. The rate of occurrence of 
events at 6 and 12 months will also be provided by  K-M estimation. Patients who do not have 
any of the events or drop out earl y will be considered as censored for this analysis.  
Additionally , descriptive rate with number of patients with event divided by total treated 
patients will also be provided. Earl y drop out and lost -to-follow -
up will be considered as non -
event.  The components of the composite event will be summarized as below:
Recurrence of venous thromboembolism will be 
summarized by  Kaplan- Meier 
estimate of time to first recurrence of VTE. The rate of recurrence at 6 and 12 mon ths 
will also be provided b y K-M estimation. Patients, who do not experience recurrent 
VTE by  the time of anal yses, drop out from the study, or die from non- VTE related 
cause will be considered as censored. The descriptive rate of number of patients with 
event divided b y total treated patients will also be provided. Earl y drop out and lost -
to-follow -up will be considered as non -event when calculating the descriptive rate .
Major bleeding and minor (including clinically  relevant non -major (CRNM)) bleeding
will be anal ysedby K-M estimate of time to first occurrence as competing events. 
The K -M rate estimate at 6 and 12 month will be provided. The descriptive rate will 
also be calculated b y dividing number of patients with major /minor bleeding b y the 
number o
f total treated patients. Early drop out, lost-to-follow -up and non- bleeding 
related death will be considered as non -event and censored.

summarized separatel y by K -M estimate of time to death. The K- M rate and 
descriptive rate at 6 and 12 month will be calculated. Early drop out and lost -to-
follow -up will be considered as non -event. Non -thrombotic or non-thromboembolic 
related death will be considered as censored case for mortality  due to thrombotic or 
thromboembolic events.
7.3.2 Secondary analyses
Secondary  anal yses are planned for occurrence of post -thrombotic sy ndrome (PTS) ,number 
of dabigatran etexilate dose adjustments (i.e. Number of patients with dabigatran dose 
adjustments) and pharmacody namic assessments at Visit 3(after at least sixconsecutive 
dabigatran etexilate doses) and after at least 3days following any  dabigatran etexilate dose
adjustment .
Occurrence of PTS will be summarized by  K
-M estimate of time to first occu rrence. 
The K -M rate and descriptive rate at 6 and 12 month will be calculated. Early  drop 
out, lost-to-follow -up and death will be considered as non -event and censored.
Frequency of da bigatran etexilate dose adjustments will be summarized descriptively .
This refers to the 
number of patients with dabigatran etexilate dose adjustment during 
treatment period because each patient is allowed to have onl y one dose adjustment.
  pharmacod ynamic anal yses details can be found in Section 7.3.5
and 7.3.6 .
7.3.3 Safety analyses
The safet y analyses will be descriptive in nature and will be based on BI standards. 
Parameters to be evaluated for safet y are described in Section 5.2 .
AEs will be coded using the MedDRA dictionary . All AEs will be classified according to the 
following trial periods: screening, treatment, safety  follow -up. All AEs with an onset date /
time after administration of trial medication up to 3 days after the last intake of study  
medication will be assigned to the treatment period for evaluation. I n addition, AEs with 
onset date before start of the trial treatment but with worsening in intensity  during the 
treatment will also be assigned to the on -treatment period. Other AEs will be assigned to the 
screening or post -treatment period, respectively . All AEs (including bleeding) in the 
treatment period will be tabulated in total and according to seriousness, severity  and possible 
relationship to trial medi cation. AEs in the screening or follow -up period will be listed.

Missing data will not be imputed in general. All patients will be followed to collect necessary 
efficacy  and safet y information, even if patients discontinue study  medication prematurel y. 
7.5 RANDOMISATION
Randomi sation is in general not applicable to this study .Only patients assigned to OLF will 
be randomized based on 1:1 ratio to receive flavoured or unflavoured solvent for 
reconstitution.
7.6 DETERMINATION OF SAM PLE SIZE
The design of this stu dy (including the definition of endpoints and sample size) has been 
agreed with the European Medicines Agency ’s Paediatric Committee. A minimum of 100 
patients will be entered in this trial , including patients rolling over from study  1160.106, who 
require secondary  VTE prevention and new patients who should have completed treatment 
for an acute VTE episode. The Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) or Sponsor may decide to 
keep recruitment open after 100 patients have been recruited, in case additional safet y dat a 
needs to be generated.
Under the assumption of 5% of event rate for the composite of recurrent VTE, major bleeds 
and mortality  related to thromboembolic event at 12 months, 100 patients will provide more 
than 99% of probability  observing at least 1 event ,  it will provide higher than 63% of 
probability  if the event  rate is 1%. The expected 95% Wilson confidence interval for event 
rates under the assumption of 100 patients are provided in Table 7.6: 1.
Table 7.6:1 Expected 95% Wilson confidence interval b ased on 100 available patients
Observed rate (%) 95% Wilson CI
1 (0.18 – 5.45)
2 (0.55 – 7.00)
3 (1.03 – 8.45)
4 (1.57 – 9.89)
5 (2.15 – 11.2)
10 (5.52 – 17.4)
20 (13.3 – 28.9)
The sample size is considered adequate to capture any safet y signal fo r the primary  safety  
endpoints defined in the study .

This document may not -in full or in part -be passed on, reproduced, published or oth erwise used without prior written permission.8.2 DATA QUALITY ASSURANCE
The trial will be conducted according to the principles of Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and 
the compan y standard operating procedures (SOPs).
The following measures will be taken to ensure accurate, consistent, complete and reliable 
data:
All required trial documents will be distributed to every  trial site and kept in the I nvestigator 
Site File (I SF). An investigator meeting will be held (may  be held by  webcast or similar 
means) before the trial to assure a high quality  and standardization across sites.
Trial teams at the sites will be trained on protocol requirements, trial procedures, adverse 
event reporting, and remote data capture dur ing the investigator meeting and / or by  Clinical 
Research Associates (CRAs) during the respective monitoring visits.
On-site monitoring: Data captured in the eCRF will be verified against source data and vice 
versa b y CRAs. The identity  and informed conse nt of all patients as well as SAE reporting 
will be checked. For the remaining parts of the eCRF source data verification will be 
performed as described in the Monitoring Manual.
Auditing (internal and, if required b y any regulatory authorities, external) will be performed 
as necessary .
Coding (e.g., according to MedDRA for adverse events) will be performed according to the 
compan y’s SOPs as described in the trial data management and anal ysis plan (TDMAP). The 
data management procedures to ensure the qualit y of the data are described in detail in the 
(TDMAP) available in the CTMF.
A quality  assurance audit / inspection of this trial may  be conducted by  the Sponsor or 
Sponsor’s designees or by  IRBs/IECs or by  regulatory  authorities. The quality  assurance 
auditor will have access to all medical records, the investigator’s trial -related files and 
correspondence, and the informed consent documentation of this clinical trial.
8.3 RECORDS
Case Report Forms (CRFs) for individual patients will be provided by  the S
ponsor, either on 
paper or via remote data capture. See Section 4.1.5.2 for rules about emergency  code breaks. 
For drug accountability , refer to Section 4.1.8 .
8.3.1 Source documents
Source documents provide evidence for the existence of the patient and substantiate the 
integrit y of the data collected. Source documents are filed at the investigator ’s site.
Data entered in the eCRFs that are transcribed from source documents must be consistent 
with the source documents or the discrepancies must be explained. The investigator may need

medical records must be available.
For eCRFs all data must be derived from sou rce documents .
Copies of source documents necessary  for adjudication will be provided to the adjudication 
committee. Before sending or uploading those copies, the investigator must ensure that all 
patient identifiers (e.g. patient´s name, initials, address, phone number, social securit y 
number) have properly  been removed or redacted from any  copy of the patients´ source 
documents.
8.3.2 Direct access to source data and documents
The investigator / institution will permit trial -related monitoring, audits, IRB / IEC review 
and regulatory  inspection, providing direct access to all related source data / documents. 
CRFs/eCRFs and all source documents, including progress notes and copies of laboratory  and 
medical test results must be available at all times for r eview b y the Sponsor ’s clinical trial 
monitor , auditor and inspection by  health authorities (e.g. FDA). The Clinical Research 
Associate (CRA) / on site monitor and auditor 
may review all CRFs/eCRFs, and written 
informed consents. The accuracy  of the data w ill be verified by  reviewing the do cuments 
described in Section 8.3.1.
8.4 LISTEDNESS AND EXPED ITED REPORTING OF ADVERSE EVENTS
8.4.1 Listedness
To fulfil the regulatory  requirements for expedited safet y reporting, the Sponsor 
evaluates 
whether a particular adverse event is "listed ", i.e. is a known side effect of the drug or not.
Therefore a unique reference document for the evaluation of listedness need sto be provided. 
For dabigatran etexilate this is the current version of t he Investigator’s Brochure (U98-
3208 ).The current version sof these reference documents are to be provided in the I SF. No 
AEs are classified as listed for study  design, or invasive procedure s.
8.4.2 Expedited reporting to health authorities andIECs/IRBs
Expedited reporting of serious adverse events, e.g. suspected unexpected serious adverse 
reactions (SUSARs) to health authorities andIECs/I RBs, will be done according to local 
regulatory  requirements. Further details regarding t
his reporting procedure are provided in the 
Investigator Site File.
8.5 STATEMENT OF CONFIDE NTIALITY
Individual 
patient medical information obtained as a result of this trial is considered 
confidential and disclosure to third parties is prohibited with the exceptions noted below. 
Patient confidentiality  will be ensured by  using patient identification code numbers.

In case of infants and when medicall y required per Investigator judgment and/or per local 
guidelines, reduced blood collection willbe implemented after consultation with the Sponsor 
(e.g. omission of exploratory coagulation markers, reduced frequency  of safety  labs during 
the treatment period, etc.). The decision for the reduced blood collection will be documented 
in the I SF.
10.2 CLINICAL EVALUATION OF LIVER INJURY
10.2.1 Introduction
Alterations of liver laboratory  parameters, as described in S ection 5.2.2.1 (refer to Protocol -
Specified AESI ), are to be further evaluated using the following procedures:
10.2.2 Procedures
Repeat the following laboratory  tests: ALT, AS T, and bilirubin (total and direct) - within 48 
to 72 hours and provide additional blood sample to the central laboratory for automatic reflex 
testing of the below listed laboratory  parameters. Only  in case whereb y the central laboratory 
is not immediately available (e.g. if the logistics are such that the patient´s repeat specimen 
would not reach the central laboratory  in a reasonable timeframe), ALT, AST, and bilirubin 
(total and direct) will be evaluated by local laboratory and results are made available to the 
investigator and to BI as soon as possible. If in such a case ALT and /or AST >3 fold ULN 
combined with an elevation of total bilirubin >2 fold UL N are confirmed, results of the 
laboratory  parameters described below must be made available to the i nvestigator and to BI 
as soon as possible.

In addition,
Obtain a detailed history  of current sy mptoms and concurrent diagnoses and medical 
history  according to the “DILI checklist” provided in the I SF
Obtain history  of concomitant drug use (including non- prescription medications, herbal 
and dietary  supplement preparations), alcohol use, recreational drug use, and special diets 
according to the “DILI checklist ” provided in the ISF;
Obtain a history  of exposure to environmental chemical agents (consider home and work 
place exposure) according to the “DILI checklist” provided in the I SF;
Provide abdominal ultrasound to rule out biliary tract, pancreatic or intra -hepatic 
pathology , e.g. bile de duct stones or neoplasm.
Initiate close observation of patients by repeat testing of ALT, AST, and total bilirubin 
(with fractionation b y total and direct) at least weekly  until the laboratory  ALT and or 
AST abnormalities stabilize or return to normal, then according to the protocol. 
Depending on further laboratory  changes, additional parameters identified e.g. b y reflex 
testing will be followed up based on medical judgment and Good Clinical Practices 
(GCP).
and report these via the CRF.
10.3 TRANSITION TO NON- STUDY ANTITHROMBOTIC TREATMENT 
WITH EARLY STUDY DRU G DISCONTINUATION OR AT THE END OF 
THE TRIAL
Patients actively  taking study  drug at their final treatment visit and patients who stop study  
medication earl y ma y need to switch to a non -study  antithrombotic treatment at the 
Investigator`s discretion. The following recommendations are provided for guidance onl y:
If the non- study  treatment is a Vitamin K antagonist, the starting time of the VKA should 
be adjusted according to the patient´s eGFR as follows:
o eGFR ≥ 50 mL /min: start VKA 3 day s before discontinuing study  drug
o eGFR ≥ 30- < 50 mL /min: start VKA 2 day s before discontinuing study  drug
If the non- study  treatment will be a L MWH, it is recommended to wait 12 hours after the 
last dose of dabigatran etexilate (study  medication) before switching to a parenteral 
anticoagulant (e.g. UFH, LMWH).  
If the non- study  treatment will be an antiplatelet agent, this medication can be initiated at 
any time -point after last intake of st udy medication.

Patients aged ≥ 8 y ears: Age and weight adjusted dabigatran etexilate capsules.
Patients aged < 8 years or for patients who cannot take capsules even if older than 8 (but 
below 12 y ears of age) : Age and weight adjusted dabigatran etexilate pellets.
Patient s aged < 12 m onths: Age and weight adjusted dabigatran etexilate OLF or an y other 
alternative age -appropriate formulation. For patients < 12 months of age OLF is preferred 
over pellets provided that OLF supplies are available to the site.
Dabigatran etexil ate is taken twice dail y (BID). 
Estimated age and weight adjusted doses are outlined in the following nomograms , which 
refer to the total amount of dabigatran etexilate to be taken at a single time -point.

Description of change Rationale for dosing regimen has been provided
Rationale for change Justification of dose regimen
Section to be changed All relevant sections of the CTP have been 
updated to implement B ID regimen using actual 
calculated dosages (according to Hay ton) rather 
than capped dosages
Description of change The maximal single dose was defined to be 330 
mg. It was clarified that the maximal daily dose 
level will neither exceed a daily dose level of 22.2 
mg/kg nor a single dose of 330 mg. In the higher

daily dose of 660 mg.
Only one up- titration will be acceptable. The dose 
may be increased by 15 -100% depending on the 
age and weight of the patient.
Patients who cannot reach the target trough 
plasma concentrations after one dose adjustmen t
must discontinue dabigatran treatment and be 
treated at the investigator’s discretion on SOC. 
The extent of up -titration has been modified from 
initially 85 -100% to now 15-100% in order to not 
exceed maximum daily dosages based on 
acceptable toxicology limits.
Dosing and dose adjustment nomograms were 
incorporated as Appendix 10. 4
Rationale for change The bleeding risk in the paediatric patient 
population is con sidered to be lower than that in 
adult populations (e.g. in the adult SPAF and 
VTE indications). Based on an overall benefit -risk 
assessment including the fact that the risk of 
thrombotic events is highest in the first 30 days, 
the predicted exposure in an uncapped BID 
regimen (up to a dose of 330 mg BID) is 
considered favourable
Section to be changed All relevant sections of the CTP
Description of change The dabigatran etexilate formulations assignment 
was clarified as follows:
Patients aged ≥ 8 y ears: Age and weight adjusted 
dabigatran etexilate capsules using 50 mg, 75 mg 
and 110 mg doses.
Patients aged 6 months to < 8 y ears or for patients 
who cannot take capsules even if older than 8 (but 
below 12 y ears of age) : Age and weigh t adjusted 
dabigatran etexilate pellets.
Patients aged 0 to < 6 months or for patients who 
cann ot take pellets at an age of 6 to 12 months: 
Age and weight adjusted dabigatran etexilate oral 
liquid formulation
Rationale for change Clarification on the use of age -appropriate 
formulations

The DMC may implem ent a partial release of the 
youngest age group (0 to <2 years of age) 
depending on the availability of PK/PD data from

Description of change The following was added to Inclusion criterion 2:
In case of the initial VKA treatment the intended INR 
should be betw een 2 and 3.

Description of change Insertion of a central venous line is not 
considered a major surgery provided haemostasis 
is achieved after the procedure
Rationale for change Clarificatio nthat central venous line insertion is 
not considered a major surgery
Section to be changed 3.3.3 Exclusion criteria
Description of change It was clarified that patients with history of 
asymptomatic petechial or microbleeds are 
eligible for the stu dy
. Definition of microbleeds 
was provided in a footnote.
Rationale for change Asymptomatic petechial or microbleeds are 
incidental findings that are not considered to 
increase the risk of bleeding. Therefore, they do 
not constitute an exclusion criteri on.It was 
clarified in the footnote how microbleeds are 
defined in order to distinguish them from 
macrobleeds, which represent an exclusion 
criterion for this trial.
Section to be changed 3.3.3 Exclusion criteria
3.3.4 Removal of patients from therap yor 
assessments
Description of change eGFR retesting during the screening period was
allowed
Patients will have to discontinue dabigatran 
treatment anytime during the course of the study 
if eGFR drops < 50 mL/min/1.73m2using the 
Schwartz formula and th is is confirmed by one 
retesting within the next 14 calendar days
Rationale for change This safeguard regarding renal function during 
the trial is considered overly conservative. It led 
to an unnecessary stop of dabigatran etexilate 
treatment in of some initial patients in this trial, 
where eGFR was measured to be just below 80 
mL/min/1.73m2. Beyond renal function, this trial 
will use PK measurements of dabigatran and a 
target plasma level range as safeguard. In

(eGFR of >8 0 mL/min/1.73m2are allowed to 
enter this trial. Thus, it is considered safe to 
lower the removal criterion of eGFR during the 
trial to 50 mL/min/1.73m2.
Section to be changed 3.3.3 Exclusion criteria
4.2.2 Restrictions
Description of change P-glycoprotein inhibitors intake up until first dose 
of study medication will not be restricted or 
considered as exclusion criterion
Rationale for change The interaction of P -gp inhibitors and dabigatran 
occurs on the gut level during the abs orption of 
dabigatran. Peak plasma levels of dabigatran are 
reached within a few hours after intake of 
dabigatran. Therefore, the initially proposed 
washout period of one week is considered not 
necessary for P -gp inhibitors. As an additional 
safeguard, pla sma level measurements of 
dabigatran will be performed

10.4 Dosing of Dabigatran etexilate
Description of change 150 mg capsule was introduced
Rationale for change 150 mg dabigatran etexila te capsule was 
introduced to the trial in order to reduce the 
number of capsules taken by patient at a single 
time point

phase IIa PK/PD studies relevant for the patients 
to be included in second age group (2 to<12 
years) and in youngest age group (0 to <2 years)
Section to be changed 3.3 SELECTION OF TRIAL POPUL ATION
Description of change It was clarified that patie nts in in age group 2 yrs. 
to <12 yrs. will be included and treated in 
accordance to the availability of the age 
appropriate dabigatran etexilate formulations
Rationale for change To reflect the sequential introduction of 
dabigatran age appropriate form ulations and 
OLF in particular
Section to be changed 3.3.3 Exclusion criteria
Description of change eGFR level for exclusion criterion 2) relative to 
patients aged 12 to < 18 years was set at < 60 
mL/min/1.73m2. 
For patients aged 0 to < 12 years th e eGFR level 
for exclusion remains < 80 mL/min/1.73m2
Rationale for change An interim analysis of 27 patients treated with 
dabigatran etexilate in the 1160.106 and 
1160.108 has shown a good safety and 
tolerability profile in adolescent patients aged 12 
to <18 years. Also, the currently used dosing 
algorithm with uncapped starting dose resulted 
into approximately 95% of PK trough plasma 
concentrations within the dabigatran target 
plasma range (50 to <250 ng/ml). After one dose 
adjustment more than 98% or measurement were 
within the target range. No measurement was 
above the target range. The previous exclusion 
criterion of eGFR <80 mL/min/1.73m2seems to 
be too restrictive in patients 12 to <18 years; 
therefore, a cut -off of 60 mL/min/1.73m2is 
considered acceptable for this age group and will 
allow inclusion of more patients who could 
benefit from the participation of the study.

Description of change Exclusion criterion 4) was modified to clarify that 
patients with be excluded if they have heart valve 
prosthesis requiring anticoagulation treatment.
Rationale for change To comply with dabi gatran etexilate IB, allowing 
patients with heart valve prosthesis not requiring 
anticoagulation treatment to be included in the 
study if they would benefit f rom their
participation .
Section to be changed 4.1.4 Drug assignment and administration of 
doses for each patient
Description of change The recommendation to use “a proton pump 
inhibitor such as pantoprazol e” in case of 
development of gastrointestinal symptoms was 
replaced by recommendation to use a proton 
pump inhibitor according to “the local standard 
of care in accordance with local labelling 
recommendations”.
Rationale for change The locally approved labelling information, e.g. 
the Prescribing Information or Product 
Information of different proton pump inhibitors 
(PPIs )may vary between products and countries. 
Importantly, certain PPIs may only be approved 
for certain age groups according to local

secondary endpoint of “Pharmacodynamic 
assessments ”.
For t he secondary endpoint “ Pharmacodynamic 
assessments ”evaluations at Visit 3(after at least
sixconsecutive dabigatran etexilate doses) and 
after at least 3days following any dabigatran
etexilate dose adjustment will be considered. The 
reference to Visit 4 was deleted.

Section to be changed Section 3.3.3 Exclusion criteria
Description of change The eGFR level for exclusion criterion no. 2 w as 
lowered to < 50 mL/min/1.73m2for all patients, 
irrespective of their age.
Rationale for change The previous exclusion criteria regarding eGFR 
were set up when limited data of patients exposed 
to dabigatran were available. As currently, the 
available data show a favorable benefit/risk 
relationship for dabigatran and no excess of 
dabigatran plasma levels ( ≥250ng/ml) in patients 
below 12 years of age, these criteria seem to be 
too restrictive as they do not take into account the 
physiological maturation of renal function with 
age. A cut -off of 50 mL/min/1.73m2 takes into 
account the physiologically lower eGFR at 
younger age, and would allow for the inclusion of

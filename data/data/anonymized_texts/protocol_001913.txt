Title:  Clinical Trial on the Safety and Efficacy of Regadenoson for Moderate to Severe 
COVID -19 Adult Patients.  
Short Title:  Regadenoson Trial  on COVID -19 Patients  
Disease:  Moderate to Severe  Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS -CoV-
2), aka Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID -19). 
Target Population:  Moderate to Severe  adult patients with COVID -19. 
Phase of Development:  Phase 2  
Primary Objectives:  
The primary objective of this study is t o evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of 
Regadenoson in moderate to severe  adults with COVID -19. Moderate illness  is 
defined as individuals who have evidence of lower respiratory disease by clinical 
assessment or imaging and a saturation of oxygen (SpO2) >93% on room air at sea 
level. Severe Illness  is defined as individuals who have respiratory frequency >30 
breaths  per minute, SpO2 ≤ 93% on room air at sea level, ratio of arterial partial 
pressure of oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO2/FiO2) <300, or lung 
infiltrates > 50% 
Primary Endpoint:  
Proportion of patients alive and free of respiratory failure through the 30-day trial.  
Respiratory failure is defined based on resource utilization requiring at least 1 of the 
following modalities:  
a. Endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation  
b. Oxygen delivered by high -flow nasal cannula (heated, humidified, oxyg en delivered 
via reinforced nasal cannula at flow rates >20L/min with fraction of delivered oxygen 
≥0.5) 
c. Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation or CPAP  
d. ECMO  
Secondary Endpoints:  
1.   A 2 -point improvement from baseline using the National Institutes of Allergy and 
Infectious Diseases (NIAID) 8 -point ordinal scale for COVID -19 (see APPENDIX A). All -
cause mortality at Day 30.  
5 
 2. Proportion of participants with at least 2 -point improvement at Day 15 and Day 30 
using the NIAID 8 -point ordinal s cale. 
3. ICU length of stay  
4. Hospital length of sta y 
In addition: The data on 1) Physical Exam; 2) Clinical Laboratory Values 3) Arterial 
Blood Gas; and 4) Vital Signs, including heart rate, blood pressure and oxygen 
saturation, at the different time -points prior, during and post the study drug 
administration will be collected to evaluate the effects of R egadenoson on these 
patients. The data on the ventilator parameters, the length of stay on ventilator, and the 
length of stay in ICU and/or hospital will  also be collected during the post follow up to 
evaluate the efficacy of R egadenoson in these moderate to severe Covid -19 patients.  
Due to the mixture of the moderate and severe COVID -19 patients with various baseline 
severity levels, we will record pertinent patient information , such as age, sex,  race,  
symptoms, signs, saturation of oxygen, medications, treatments, days of illness, 
comorbidities , chest X -ray imaging, and baseline severity (such as, on oxygen, on 
ventilator, on ECMO etc.) prior to Regadeno son infusion. We will also record whether 
each participated patient is treated with additional COVID -19 therapies . When we 
analy ze the effects of Regadenoson on COVID -19, we can subgroup these patients and 
conduct primary efficacy analysis and propose appropriate methods of covariate 
adjustment.  
Study Design:  
This is a single center , randomized , phase 2 study to evaluate the safety,  tolerability, 
and efficacy of Regadenoson for the treatment of moderate to severe adults with 
COVID -19.  Patients will be followed up for 30 days from  the start of study drug 
administration.  
Estimated sample size: 40 
Estimated accrual period:  18 months  
Allocation:  Randomized  
Masking:  Double -blind, placebo -controlled  
Study Duration  for each subject : 30 days  
Study Treatments:  
Regadenoson will be given intravenously as a 5µg/kg  loading dose (a dose less than 
400µg)  over 30 min utes, followed by a con tinuous slow infusion (1.44 µg/kg/hour) with 
6 
 the use of a pediatric infusion pump for 6 hours.  The saline will be used as placebo 
controls.

Safety  Assessments:   
This study will be conducted in 2 cohorts .  Our ongoing phase 1 trial with slow infusion 
of Regadenoson (1.44micrograms/kg/hour) in lung transplant  patients  study showed no 
obvious dose limiting toxicity.  Safety assessments (vital signs, Pulse oximetry and 
Arterial Blood Gas, laboratory studies, electrocardiograms , etc.) will be performed on a 
schedule commensurate with the level of care and the identified p otential risk of the 
study drug during Regadenoson infusion and 12 hours post infusion. Given the cardiac 
risk with Regadenoson, we will continue cardiac monitoring during the infusion of 
Regadenoson, and EKGs daily or as needed, and cardiac markers only i f cardiac 
symptoms occur. To monitor potential platelet aggregation effects, labs (PT, PTT, INR, 
platelets,  D-Dimer,  and thromboelastography (TEG) ) will be drawn prior to the infusion 
and on post infusion  day 1. Patients who receive anti -clotting medicatio ns during 
Regadenoson infusion or within 6 hours of the end of infusion will be checked for 
clotting time and if necessary, anti -coagulant administration will be reduced or stopped.  
In addition, we will have a pregnancy test for patients who may have poten tial risk with a 
urine sample before study drug administration . Patients with a  negative result will be 
enrolled. We will ensure that protections for women of childbearing potential align with 
International Council on Harmonization M3 R2 guidelines for hig hly effective methods of 
contraception.  
In cohort 1, w e will enroll patients to  test the safety, tolerability and toxicity in moderate 
to severe COVID -19 patients. Initial  subjects in c ohort 1 will receive a loading dose  of 
5.0 µg/kg (not to exceed 400 µg) over 30 minutes followed by a low dose infusion of 
1.44 µg/kg/ hr. Toxicity of Regadenoson treatment will be graded by using the Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Criteria version 4.03 in this tria l. If 
two dose limiting toxicities occur at a loading dose of 5.0 µg/kg then the loading do se 
will be halve d to 2.5 µg/kg and enrollment will continue . If two dose limiting toxicities 
occur at a loading dose of 2.5 µg/kg then the Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) 
will convene to determine if the study should continue and omitting the loading  dose 
may be considered. Alternatively,  the DSMB will convene after 5 out of 5 patients or 5 
out of 6 patients tolerate a given loading dose to make a determin ation  on moving  
forward to cohort 2 . Otherwise, the trial will be terminated. (please see the details in the 
Detailed DSMB Plan section ) 
 
The sickle cell trial and o ur phase 1 trial in lung transplant patients did not show any 
renal/hepatic toxicity. Because COVID -19 itself may cause renal injury , we will closely 
monitor the renal and hepatic funct ion of these patients per their standard of care. To 
assess safety of each subject, we will tabulate sequentially the number of participants 
8 
 who unexpectedly experience serious cardiovascular side effects or persistent (> 30 
min) intolerable side effects. If at any point in the accrual, the posterior probability 
exceeds 90% that the risk of at least one serious side effect for participants in the 
Regadenoson arm is more than 10 percentage points greater than in the standard care 
arm, we will stop t he trial.  
 
Adverse Event (AE) Recording and Reporting:  
 
All adverse events will be collected starting at time of consent through POD 30. Adverse 
events will be recorded on a case report form and will be assessed for seriousness, 
severity, attribution and expectedness by the site Principal Investigator . A serious 
cardiovascular side effect is defined as a sustained change  (> 5 minutes)  in 
systolic blood pressure >30 mm Hg or systolic blood pressure <75 mm Hg, 
tachycardia >130 bpm , or bradycardia <40 bpm.  
 
The COVID -19 patient population has increased risk for vascular events and these 
events are monitored as part of standard of care. Standard of care will be followed,  and 
diagnostics may include lab values and imaging studies. Additionally, PT, PTT, INR, 
platelets, and TEG labs will be drawn before and after the infusion and t he study team 
will monitor the study participants by observing their clinical progress/course for any 
such clinically significant vascular events that occur during the study period . Thes e 
events will report them as adverse events as part of good clinical research practice.  
 
Reporting to the UMB HSR -IRB and  DSMB :  
 
The Principal Investigator or designee is responsible for reporting SAEs and 
unanticipated problems to the site IRB  according to the participating site institutional 
guidelines. ( Please see the revised additional  information form details)  
 
Reporting to the FDA:  
 
The PI for the study is responsible for providing safety updates to the FDA per the 
guidelines. The reporti ng times refer to the time the study team received knowledge of 
the AE. Please see the attached Table 1 for details.  
 
Sample Size and Statistical Analysis:  
The study aims to  maximize knowledge on the use of Regadenoson to treat COVID -19 
in order to plan fo r a larger trial. Safety analysis will be prioritized to allow for the 
expansion to a multi -site trial. The study will enroll moderate and severely ill subjects to 
maximize enrollment at the single enrolling institution. Severity of illness and baseline 
respiratory failure will be delineated  within the  analysis to account for the variability in 
the patient p opulation. This trial will provide estimates of outcome variability in the 
primary and secondary outcomes that will be valuable for planning a larger randomized 
trial. Additionally, in planning for a larger trial, exploratory analyses will adjust estimates  
of treatment differences by known risk factors. Although we recognize that these 
9 
 analyses will be limited by the number of observed events, they will be useful for 
decisions on eligibility criteria or stratification factors in the larger trial.  The analy ses will 
be carried out on data from all randomized participants .  
 
We will enroll 40 moderate to severe COVID -19 patients, which is defined in the 
inclusion criteria above. Following the recommendation of the FDA review of our IND 
application, the trial f ocuses on providing estimates of outcome variability in the primary 
and secondary outcomes that will be valuable for planning a larger randomized trial. 
Additionally, in planning for a larger trial, exploratory analyses will adjust estimates of 
treatment d ifferences by known risk factors . Due to the mixture of the moderate to 
severe COVID -19 patients with various baseline severity levels, we will record 
information regarding each patient, such as age, sex, race, symptoms, vital signs, 
saturation of oxygen, medications, treatments, days of illness, comorbidities, chest X -
ray imaging, and baseline severity (such as, whether on oxygen, on ventilator, or on 
ECMO etc.) prior to Regadenoson infusion. When we analy ze the effects of 
Regadenoson on COVID -19 patients , we can do exploratory analyses within subgroup s 
of these patients and conduct primary efficacy analysis and propose appropriate 
methods of covariate adjustment. The prevention and treatment of respiratory failure will 
be analyzed within appropriate subgro ups. For each subject, we will clearly document 
the reason for hospital admission, document the standard of care followed for each 
subject, and if care decisions are made based on resource limitation.  
 
The primary outcome is the proportion of patients alive and free of respiratory failure 
through the 30 -day trial. The total sample size of 40 participants will be randomized 
equally between the usual care and Regadenoson groups, using a randomly permuted 
block design, with random block sizes of 2  and 4.  This plan will be generated by the 
study statistician.   Within each group, the primary outcome proportion can be estimated 
with a standard error of no more than 11 percentage points; the difference between the 
groups can be estimated with a stand ard error that is no more than 16 percentage 
points.  These calculations are based on the most conservative estimate in terms of 
standard error, using a proportion of 50% in each group.  If, as expected, the 
proportions in each group are greater, such as 8 0% in usual care and 90% in the 
Regadenoson group, the difference can be estimated with a standard error of 11 
percentage points.  While these are relatively large standard errors, they are adequate 
to meet the objective suggested by the IND review, provid ing estimates of outcome 
proportions to be used in a larger trial.  
 
To assess safety , the DSMB statistician  will tabulate sequentially the proportion of 
participants in each group who unexpectedly experience serious cardiovascular side 
effects or persistent (> 30 min) intolerable side effects, based on clinical experience with 
Regadenoson.  Intolerable side effects i nclude headache or dyspnea .  If the lower bound 
of a one -sided 80% confidence interval for the difference in proportions exceeds 10%, 
we will pause the trial, examine the adverse event profiles, and consider modifying 
dosing.  With this rule, if the true p roportion of patients who experience serious side 
effects is 20% in each group, there is a 16.5% chance that the trial will be paused; if the 
10 
 true proportion with Regadenoson is 40%, there is a 58% chance the study will be 
paused.     
 
To plan for a future  study, we will compute a 90% one -sided confidence interval (CI) for 
the difference in failure free survival (FFS) proportions at 30 days. The CI will use 
standard formulas for estimates and standard errors for the Kaplan -Meier estimate of 
the FFS distribu tion at a specific point in time (Klein et al, 2007). Censoring on the 
primary outcome will be unlikely since we will have follow -up at 30 days for FFS.  For 
the secondary outcome of time to improvement as well as for the length of stay 
outcomes, survival time will be used as a competing risk (see Brock et al, 2011 and 
Harhay et al, 2019). Both of these papers recommend the use of cumulative incidence 
curves (CIC) for competing risks, as described by Kleinbaum and Klein, 2012).  Group 
comparisons of the spe cific CIC can be made with the test of Grey (1988); with 
covariates, the method of Fine and Gray (1999) can be used to model the CIC.

 Volume  2: Detailed  Information  for IND  149635  Application  
Drug N ame: CVT3146, Generic Name: Regadenoson Injection, Trade Name:  Lexiscan  
A Description of The drug Substance:  Regadenoson  is an A2A adenosine  receptor  
agonist  that is a coronary  vasodilator  [see Clinical  Pharmacology  (12.1)].  Regadenoson  
is chemically  described  as adenosine,  2-[4- [(methylamino)carbonyl] -1H-pyrazol -1-yl]-, 
monohydrate.  Its structural  formula  is: 
 
The molecular  formula  for Regadenoson  is C15H18N8O5  • H2O and its molecular  
weight  is 408.37.  LEXISCAN  is a sterile,  nonpyrogenic  solution  for intravenous  injection.  
The solution  is clear  and colorless.   
 
The Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient (API) and Formulation for Clinical Study:  Each  1 mL 
in the 5 mL pre-filled syringe  contains  0.084  mg of Regadenoson  monohydrate,  
corresponding  to 0.08 mg Regadenoson  on an anhydrous  basis,  10.9 mg dibasic  
sodium  phosphate  dihydrate  or 8.7 mg dibasic sodium  phosphate  anhydrous,  5.4 mg 
monobasic  sodium  phosphate  monohydrate,  150 mg propylene  glycol,  1 mg edetate  
disodium  dihydrate,  and Water  for Injection,  with pH between  6.3 and 7.7. 
 
Dosage Form, Formulation and Route of Administration:  liquid,  400 micrograms/vial.  The 
recommended  dose  of LEXISCAN  is 5 mL (0.4 mg Regadenoson)  administered  as an 
intravenous  injection  within  10 seconds.  
 
The Known or Suspected Mechanism of Action of The Drug: Regadenoson  is a low affinity  
agonist  (Ki ≈ 1.3 μM) for the A2A adenosine  receptor,  with at least10 -fold lower  affinity  
for the A1 adenosine  receptor  (Ki > 16.5 μM), and weak,  if any, affinity  for the A2B and 
A3 adenosine  receptors.  Activation  of the A2A adenosine  receptor  by Regadenoson  
produces  coronary  vasod ilation  and increases  coronary  blood  flow (CBF).  
 
A Summary of The Available Pharmacokinetic Information:  In healthy subjects, the 
Regadenoson plasma concentration -time profile is multi -exponential in nature and best 
characterized by 3 -compartment model. The maximal plasma concentration of 
Regadenoson is achieved within 1 to 4 minutes after injection of LEXISC AN and 
parallels the onset of the pharmacodynamic response. The half -life of this initial phase 
is approximately 2 to 4 minutes. An intermediate phase follows, with a half -life on 
average of 30 minutes coinciding with loss of the pharmacodynamic effect. Th e terminal 

12 
 phase consists of a decline in plasma concentration with a half -life of approximately 2 
hours [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ]. Within the dose range of 0.3 –20 μg/kg in 
healthy subjects, clearance, terminal half -life or volume of distribution do not appear 
dependent upon the dose.  
 
According to the Lexiscan label description, in a randomized, placebo -controlled trial of 
504 patients (LEXISCAN n=334 and placebo n=170) with a diagnosis or risk factors for 
coronary artery disease and NKFK/DOQI Sta ge III or IV renal impairment (defined as 
GFR 15 -59 mL/min/1.73 m2), no serious adverse events were reported through  the 24 -
hour follow -up period.  
 
Since the dose we will use in this trial is lower than the MPI trial, we anticipate that 
Regadenoson infusi on may not impair renal function. Our phase I trial in lung transplant 
patients did not show any renal/hepatic toxicity. However, because COVID -19 itself may 
cause renal injury, plus  standard of care treatments  may also affect kidney function, 
these factors may impair renal or hepatic function.   
 
The Renal and Hepatic Function Criteria:  
 
The stages of Chronic Kidney Disease are classified as follows:  
 
• Stage 1: Kidney damage with normal or increased GFR (>90 mL /min/1.73 m2)  
• Stage 2: Mild reduction in GFR (60 -89 mL/min/1.73 m2)  
• Stage 3a: Moderate reduction in GFR (45 -59 mL/min/1.73 m2)  
• Stage 3b: Moderate reduction in GFR (30 -44 mL/min/1.73 m2)  
• Stage 4: Severe reduction in GFR (15 -29 mL/min/1.73 m2)  
• Stage 5: Kidney failure (GFR < 15 mL/min/1.73 m2 or dialysis)  
 
or  
 
• Acute kidney injury Grade scales:  
• Grade 1: Creatinine level increase of >0.3 mg/dL; creatinine 1.5 - 2.0 x above 
baseline  
• Grade 2: Creatinine 2 - 3 x above baseline  
• Grade 3: Creatinine >3 x baseline or >4.0 mg/dL; hospitalization indicated  
• Grade 4: Life -threatening consequences; di alysis indicated  
• Grade 5: Death

If any participated patients developed renal or liver impairments as described above 
(Kidney: Stages 3 and 4 or Grade Scale>3, or Liver summed scores>B), we will stop the 
infusion of Regadenoson and take the following steps : All study activities wi ll take place 
within the hospital setting with available physician, nurse, and facility support. Should a 
participant suffer any injury as a result of taking part in this research study, all needed 
facilities, emergency treatment and professional services will be available to them, just 
as they are to the community in general. Participants will be informed that there are no 
arrangements to provide free treatment of the injury or any other type of payment for the 
injury. These will be billed to the participa nt or his/her insurance and this information will 
be reviewed during the informed consent process. Any injuries will be reported to the 
clinical site PI. The PI contact information will be provided to the participant within the 
informed consent. The partic ipant /LAR  will also be informed that he/she (they) will not 
give up any legal rights by providing verbal consent or signing the consent form.  
 
Data  and Literature  Supporting  The Proposed  Use of The Drug in COVID -19: 
 
Activation of adenosine 2A receptors inhibits inflammation by directly targeting multiple 
inflammatory/immune cells. It is well established that the activity of inflammatory cells, 
including invariant natural killer T (iNKT), NKs, macrophages, DCs, monocytes, T -cells, 
platelets, and  neutrophils, is inhibited by A2AR activation, resulting in reduced 
proinflammatory cytokines and decreased endothelial adhesion molecule expression 
during acute lung injury  in different animal models (mouse/rat acute lung injury models, 
pre-clinical porc ine lung transplantation model) [1-4]. A2AR agonist inhibited 
inflammatory/immune cells (such as iNKT cells and neutrophil) activation and infiltration 
into the lungs, Therefore, A2A agonists reduce acute lung injury through inhibiting 
proinflammatory cyto kine releasing (including IL -6, TNFα, IFN -γ. etc) [5-9]. Our 
unpublished data showed A2A agonists also have been found to reduce lethality to 
cytokine storm associated with bacterial sepsis (Figures 1 & 2). Our phase I trial  
in lung transplant patients sh owed that low dosage, slow infusion of Regadenoson 
inhibited IL -6 production when compared with a patient without Regadenoson treatment 
(Figure 3). Regadenoson also decreased matrix metalloproteinase -9 (MMP -9) levels, 
but not MMP -2 level, when compared wi th control patient (Figure 4). We demonstrated 
14 
 that MMP -9, but not MMP -2, was significantly elevated in the acute injured lungs when 
compared with sham operated lungs [10]. The recent publications showed that MMP -9 
plays an important role in acute lung inj ury by increasing vascular permeability, 
promoting inflammatory cell infiltrating into the lungs and positively associating with IL -6, 
TNFα, and IL -8 [11-14]. In addition, our proteomic analysis data showed that 
Regadenoson treated lung transplantation pat ients increased tissue inhibitor of 
metalloproteinase -1 (TIMP -1) when compared with control patient at the same time 
points (Figure 5). TIMP -1 is an endogenous inhibitor of MMP -9. Therefore, 
Regadenoson not only down -regulated MMP -9, but also up -regulated  it's inhibitor. The 
phase II trials of adult sickle cell patients showed that Regadenoson inhibited iNKT 
cells, which is a key immune cell involved in both innate and adaptive immune response 
[15]. The newly published data showed that  respiratory failure from acute respiratory 
distress syndrome (ARDS) is the leading cause of mortality for severe COVID -19 
patients.  The severe COVID -19 patients might have a cytokine storm syndrome, as 
indicated by elevated levels of various proinflammatory cytokines, includ ing IL -6, TNFα, 
IFN-γ and others [16-29]. These life-threatening cytokines impair pulmonary function. 
Therefore, there is an urgent need to identify and treat hyperinflammation using 
existing, approved therapies with proven safety profiles to address the immediate need 
to reduce the high 2 -4% mortality of severe COVID -19 patients. We propose that 
Regadenos on be used for the treatment of patients with virally induced lung 
hyperinflammation.  We predict that A2AR agonist treatment will decrease the 
pulmonary cytokine storm evoked by viruses, reduce lung inflammation and enhance 
pulmonary function.  Based on o ur current phase 1 trial data and published evidence, 
we expect that Redadenoson may save lives of severe COVID -19 patients through 
several different mechanisms (inhibiting proinflammatory cytokine (IL -6) and MMP -9 
and increasing TIMP -1).

FDA -Approved  Labeling  and Existing  IND  for Regadenoson:   
 
Regadenoson, the proposed drug in this proposal, is FDA approved agent for 1)  
Radionuclide  myocardial  perfusion  imaging,  2) Phase  II clinical  trial in adult  sickle  cell 
disease  patient  (above  reference  #15),  3) Our phase  I clinical  trial in lung 
transplant ation  (IND#  062862,  above  reference  #30).  In the trial 1), Regadenoson  (400 
micrograms)  was given  intravenously  within  30 seconds.  In trials  2) and 3), 
Regadenoson  was administrated with low dose, slow infusion  (1.44micrograms/kg/hour)  
for up to 12 hours.   No dose  limiting  toxicity  was observed  in these  trials.  Therefore,  we 
anticipate  the dose  we are going  to use in these  moderate  to severe  COVID -19 patients  
in this proposal  will be safe.  The labeling  of Regadenoson  is attached.   
 
Results For In Vitro and In Vivo Toxicology:  Regadenoson  was negative  in the Ames  
bacterial  mutation  assay,  chromosomal  aberration  assay  in Chinese  hamster  ovary  
(CHO)  cells,  and mouse  bone  marrow  micronucleus  assay.  Long -term animal  studies  
have  not been  conducted  to evaluate  LEXISCAN's  carcinogenic  potential  or potential  
effects  on fertility.  Minimal  cardiomyopathy  (myocyte  necrosis  and inflammation)  was 
observed  in rats following  single -dose  administration  of Regadenoson.  Increased  
incidence  of minimal  cardiomyopathy  was observed  on day 2 in males  at doses  of 0.08,  
0.2 and 0.8 mg/kg  (1/5, 2/5, and 5/5) and in females  (2/5) at 0.8 mg/kg.  In a separate  
study  in male  rats, the mean  arterial  pressure  was decreased  by 30 to 50% of baseline  
values  for up to 90 minutes  at Regad enoson  doses  of 0.2 and 0.8 mg/kg,  respectively.  
No cardiomyopathy  was noted  in rats sacrificed  15 days  following  single  administration  
of Regadenoson.  The mechanism  of the cardiomyopathy  induced  by Regadenoson  was 
not elucidated  in this study  but was asso ciated  with the hypotensive  effects  of 
20 
 Regadenoson.  Profound  hypotension  induced  by vasoactive  drugs  is known  to cause  
cardiomyopathy  in rats. 
Brief Assay Descriptions : The blood samples will be collected at different timepoints prior  
to, during , and after  the Regadenoson infusion. Cytokines, biomarkers, and immune cell 
levels will be analyzed. The plasma level of R egadenoson in the participants will be 
measured according to our phase I trial in lung transplantation.  The samples (plasma) 
will be precipitated (150 µL) using 1350 µL of acetonitrile. Samples will be vortexed of 
15 seconds and spun for 10 minutes at max speed on a benchtop microfuge. 1400 µL of 
supernatant will be removed and dried. The samples will be reconstituted in 30 µL of 
50% me thanol/0.1% formic acid – water. The LC -MS system consists of a Thermo 
Electron Orbitrap ID -X mass spectrometer with a HESI source interfaced to a Thermo 
Accucore Vanquish C18 1.5um, 2.1 x 100mm column. 10 µL of the extract will be 
injected and the compoun ds eluted from the column by a methanol/0.1% formic acid 
gradient at a flow rate of 250 µL/min over 0.12 hours (0.25 hours total time).  The 
nanospray ion source will be operated at 3.2 kV.  The sample will be analyzed by MS, 
MS/MS and PRM quantification.  
 
A Detailed Justification for The Proposed Dose, Dosing range, Number of Doses, and Dose 
Interval:  Regadenoson will be given intravenously as 5 µg/kg loading dose over 30 mins 
(to avoid unpleasant side effects sometimes associated with the rapid bolus injection of 
Regadenoson), followed by a continuous slow infusion (1.44micrograms/kg/hour) with 
the use  of a pediatric infusion pump for 6 hours. The initial high dose (5 µg/kg) infusion 
is based on: Regadenoson is a FDA approved drug for myocardial perfusion imaging 
with a bolus dosing (400 micrograms, in 10 seconds). The initial dose (5 µg/kg) is lower 
than the MPI dose (400 µg).  And it will be given slower as a bolus over 30 mins. The 
low dosage (1.44micrograms/kg/hour) slow infusion is based on the Sickle cell disease 
phase II clinical trial and our clinical phase I trial in lung transplant patients. Bo th trials 
have demonstrated that low dosage infusion(1.44micrograms/kg/hour) is safe with no 
dose limiting toxicities up to 12 hours (above reference #30). A loading dose is needed 
in the present study to get effective drug concentrations to the patients a s soon as 
possible after diagnosis of cytokine storm syndrome. We will keep Aminophylline, a 
competitive adenosine receptor antagonist, on hand as a rescue medication for rare 
side effects of Regadenoson, such as bronchoconstriction.  Aminophylline has bee n 
used to terminate persistent pharmacodynamic effects. In such case, aminophylline 
may be administered in doses ranging from 50 mg to 250 mg by slow intravenous 
injection (50 mg to 100 mg over 30 –60 seconds).  
 
Trial Timeline  
Timeline:  Please see the attached for the detailed (Table 2) projected timeline for each 
patient.  A loading dose is needed in the present study to get effective drug 
concentrations to the patients as soon as possible after diagnosis of cytokine storm 
syndrome in ho spitalized COVID -19 patients. We propose to treat a total of 40 
moderate to severe COVID -19 patients in this protocol. In this trial, the discontinuation 
from study drug is defined as any subject discontinu ing Regadenoson treatment or 
discontinu ing from the study post drug treatment for any reasons (such as, COVID -19 
21 
 caused mortality, comorbidity caused serious injury). Because the study involves a 
single Regadenoson treatment with a duration less than 7 hours , the possibility of 
discontinu ation  from the st udy drug is very low. Withdraw from the study is defined as 
any subject or his/her LAR willingly withdraw ing from the clinical trial for any reasons. 
The collected data from discontinued subjects  may also be used in the outcome 
analysis.  
 
Our Retention and Follow Up Plans: Since study participation is 30 days, we anticipate 
that most participating subjects will remain either as an inpatient or will follow up 
frequently after COVID19 diagnosis and recovery. Patients will be monitored by study 
personnel according to the Post Infusion Procedures.  We will try to minimize missing 
data in this trial by taking the following steps: We will encourage patients who 
discontinue therapy to remain in the study and to continue follow -up for all key safety 
and e fficacy outcomes. Due to the pandemic, we will follow -up with these patients 
virtually via phone for all required timepoints  post Regadenoson infusion  that occur after 
discharge . We will record vital status for all patients. We will also take the following  
actions (1) the protocol and informed consent forms clearly differentiate treatment 
discontinuation from study withdrawal; (2) site investigators  will be trained on the 
importance of retention and steps to prevent missing data; (3) the consent forms inclu de 
a statement educating patients about the continued scientific importance of their data 
even if they discontinue study treatment early; and (4) take steps to be able to ascertain 
vital status in all randomized patients (e.g., with a vital records search) .  
Infusion of Regadenoson will be added to current standard of care. We recognize that 
standard of care may change as the study progresses and these issues will be 
addressed as they arise.  If not completed as standard of care, CRP will be collected at 
screening  and on day 1 ,  
The End of Study:  We anticipate the Regadenoson treatment will  1) enhance lung 
function by reducing hypoxia (as measured by pulse oximetry, ventilator parameters, 
ABGs as clinically indicated, and CXR findings), and 2) increase survival. At the end of 
this study, we will perform primary efficacy analyses and survival  analyses.  If this 
statistical analysis  prove s that Regadenoson treatment enhanced lung function, 
shorten ed the length of staying in ICU and/or hospital, and increased survival when 
compared with the randomized  placebo -control  group,  we will 1) pursue  a large scale  
multiple  sites phase  III trial for the efficacy  and long term safety  of Regadenoson  in 
moderate  to severe  COVID -19 patients,  2) will explore  the mechanisms  of its efficacy  by 
measuring  levels  of pro- and anti- inflammatory  cytokines  (such  as IL-1β, IL-4, IL-6, IL-
8, IL-10, IL-12, TNFα,  IFN-γ etc) and levels  of enzymes  and their inhibitors  (MMP -2, 
MMP -9, MPO,  neutrophil  elastase,  TIMP -1, TIMP -2, etc) and activation  of 
inflammatory/immune  cells (such  as macrophages,  neutrophils,  monocytes,  invarian t 
22 
 NKT cells,  etc).  
 
Volume 3: Detailed DSMB Plan (Regadenoson trial on COVID -19) 
 
Introduction  
 
This study will utilize a Data Safety Monitoring Board to be requested through the 
National Institute of Health.  The DSMB will follow the guidelines as described in the 
NIH issued policy on  data and safety monitoring 
(http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/research/funding/human -subjects/data -safety -monitoring -
policy ).   Safety reports will include summary tables describing patient enrollment, 
baseline characteristics of patients, adverse events, serious adverse events and any 
other relevant data requested by the board.  The DSMB may pause or halt the trial at 
any time  based on data from this or other trials.  The DSMB will determine the 
frequency of their meetings and establish a charter for this trial prior to the enrollment of 
the first subject in this study.   
 
Responsibilities of the DSMB  
 
Protections Against Risk and Loss of Confidentiality  
All research interventions will be administered by trained healthcare professionals at 
each site.  Resuscitation equipment and trained personnel will be immediately available 
during the infusion  procedure.   
The federal regulat ion under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act 
(HIPPA) governs the protection of individual identifiable health information.  The 
University of Maryland Baltimore Institutional Review Board for Health Sciences 
Research serves as the Priv acy Board and oversees institutional compliance with and 
interpretation of the HIPPA Privacy Rule. Institutional policies contain best practices for 
activities such as secure email and written documentation regarding individual patients 
and provides resour ces for clinical staff and investigators on safeguards to protect 
patient rights.  Only approved investigators and research staff will have access to the 
data for this study.  Institutional Data Protections Standards will be followed for 
collection and sto rage of the research data which contains Protected Health Information 
(PHI).  HIPPA identifiers will be destroyed with the data after all retention requirements 
have been met.  
Monitoring Plan  
Study site monitoring will be conducted by the University of Mar yland, Baltimore Office 
of Accountability and Compliance (UMB OAC).  For instances of remote monitoring, 
participating institutions will be required to forward de -identified copies of subjects’ 
medical record and source documents to the UMB OAC to aid in s ource documentation 
verification.  A complete documentation of the monitoring plan is found in the full Site 
Monitoring Plan.

STUDY CONDUCT AND ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
This study will be conducted in accordance with the standards of Good Clinical Practice 
(GCP), all applicable federal, state, and local laws, and in accord with the ethical 
principles that originated in the Declaration of Helsinki.  The PI will ensure that  staff are 
trained and carry out the study in accord with the protocol specifications.  The PI will 
ensure that all study site personnel are aware that the study protocol and all data 
generated are confidential and should not be disclosed to third parties (with the 
exception of local and national regulatory bodies which require access for oversight 
purposes). As part of our routine in clinical research at the University of Maryland, we 
collect all disparity data and report it to the IRB on an annual basis d uring the continuing 
review process.  The study may not begin at each site until IRB approval has been 
obtained.  
All COVID -19 clinical research studies at the medical center are overseen by the 
institution’s COVID -19 task force committee that helps organize  the screening of 
COVID -19 patients for study enrollment.  They have instituted a daily research huddle to 
facilitate this process and direct potential study subjects to the most appropriate clinical 
trials.  All active studies are invited to this meeting where the newly admitted/diagnosed 
COVID -19 patients are discussed and presented for consideration of enrollment in 
clinical trials. This group of clinicians and investigators has been conducting this 
meeting since the Spring 2020 and thus far it has been a very successful mechanism by 
which patients are enrolled into clinical trials in a fair and clinically relevant approach. 
We will have a representative from our study team attend this meeting each day and do 
not anticipate any barriers or conflicts relat ed to competing clinical trials.   
Consent Forms and the Consenting Process  
Consent forms will be written in accord with 21 CFR 50 and will be reviewed and 
approved by each institutions IRB prior to use. Subjects or legally authorized 
representatives (LARs ) should be educated separately about the risks associated with 
COVID -19.  Informed consent will be obtained from each participant  or LAR  prior to 
conducting any study -specific procedures.  
Since COVID19 positive patients are in isolation rooms, discussion of the study is more 
complicated.  
If the patient is alert and not intubated, the consent form could be presented to the 
patient in 2 ways; either physically by the nurse or electronically (patient can view via 
iPad). The PI will then call into the patient room and go over the study with the patient 
and answer any questions they may have.  
The patient will be evaluated to determine if they have the capacity to consent to the 
study. This evalu ation will be documented. If the patient is intubated or otherwise 
incapacitated, the legally authorized representative (LAR) will be identified and their 
relationship to the patient documented. PI will call the LAR to discuss the study . The  
research staff  will send the consent form electronically to the LAR, and the consent 
24 
 process will occur over the phone, since there may be  a no visitor policy in place for 
COVID patients. Verbal consent will be accepted . 
Maintenance of Study Documents  
Signed consent forms and other research records will be retained in a confidential 
manner.  Record retention will be in accord with 21 CFR 312.62 and HIPAA regulations.  
 
Organization and Interactions  
 
Communication with DSMB  members will be primarily through the NHLBI Program 
Office.  It is expected that study investigators will not communicate with DSMB  
members about the study directly, except when making presentations or responding to 
questions at DSMB  meetings or during conference calls.  
 
This charter may be s ent, if requested, to an IRB or an outside party under a formal 
FOIA inquiry.   
 
DSMB Members and NHLBI Program Staff  
 
DSMB  members and their expertise are listed in Appendix A.  NHLBI Program Staff 
involved in the study and their responsibilities are list ed in Appendix B. Consistent with 
NHLBI policy, each DSMB is assigned an Executive Secretary (ES) to provide an 
unbiased staff interface between the DSMB  members and other meeting participants, 
especially during closed and executive sessions.  The ES is re sponsible for assuring the 
accuracy and timely transmission of the final recommendations and DSMB  minutes.  
 
Roles of NHLBI staff in DSMB Meetings  
 
• NHLBI program staff members involved in the day -to-day conduct of the study 
may attend the open sessions of D SMB meetings.  These Program staff may 
attend portions of a closed session as needed, but not when post -randomization 
outcome data by treatment group will be discussed.   
• NHLBI’s Office of Biostatistics Research has assigned a statistician to this 
DSMB. Th e NHLBI study statistician will also serve as a resource to the DSMB 
as needed.   
• The NHLBI ES will be a federal employee with appropriate expertise and training 
who has no other involvement in the conduct of the trial and does not report 
directly to the l ead program official.  
• The ES is the only NHLBI staff member who can routinely be in the executive 
session.  The DSMB can opt to have an executive session without the ES, but 
then they will be responsible for minutes for that portion of the meeting.  The 
DSMB can request to have other staff members attend the executive session to 
provide additional information as needed.  
• The NHLBI ES and statistician are expected to report issues of substantive 
concern to the NHLBI Division Director responsible for the trial.  The NHLBI 
25 
 Division Director will communicate with the Office of the Director, NHLBI. Under 
special circumstances, and with the concurrence of the DSMB Chair, the Division 
leadership and Director and Deputy Director of the NHLBI may see unmasked 
data presented at DSMB meetings.  
• There may be occasions when it is appropriate for new staff not involved in the 
study to at tend a DSMB meeting as a training opportunity.  This will be discussed 
with the DSMB Chair before the meeting; the new staff member(s) would attend 
only the portions of the meeting outlined in the first bullet above.  
 
Scheduling, Timing, and Organization o f Meetings  
 
DSMB  meetings are usually held by conference call, or in the Washington, DC area 
when an in -person meeting is required.  
 
The purposes of the first meeting are to:  
 
• Convey NHLBI’s expectations for DSMB  operations  
• Review this Charter  
• Provide an overview of study activities  
• Review and accept or make recommendations to the protocol, consent and the 
analysis plan before approving these documents to be sent to the IRB.  
 
Enrollment in the study cannot begin until the DSMB’s recommendations for approv al 
has been accepted by the Director, NHLBI, and approval has been obtained from the 
IRB. 
 
Meetings will be scheduled based on enrollment. They will occur after the completion of 
cohort 1 as described in the safety assessment section. Meetings will also be  scheduled 
after enrollment of 15, 25, and 40 subjects , with additional meetings or conference calls 
scheduled as needed to review SAEs or other issues. Meetings and conference calls 
will be scheduled by the CCC in collaboration with the NHLBI Program Office.    
 
The agenda for DSMB meetings and calls will be drafted by the DSMB chair  in 
consultation with NHLBI staff.  The ES will finalize the agenda after consultation with the 
DSMB  Chair.  The agenda and meeting materials should be distributed b y the NHLBI 
two weeks before each meeting or call.   
 
At the time that the agenda is sent out, and again at the beginning of the meeting, the 
ES will ask all DSMB members to state whether they have developed any new conflicts 
of interest since the last for mal annual report to NHLBI.  If a new conflict is reported, the 
Chair and staff will determine if the conflict limits the ability of the DSMB member to 
participate in the discussion.   
 
The DSMB  will review adverse event data, other safety data, quality and completeness 
of study data, and enrollment data at each meeting to ensure proper trial conduct.  
Study personnel should provide any new literature particularly pertinent to the trial, 
26 
 along wit h their recommendation as to whether it affects the trial conduct or design.  
The DSMB will review the informed consent form when it reviews the protocol. The 
DSMB will review the consent periodically and/or as needed and consider whether the 
consent form requires revision in light of any new findings or amendments.  At intervals, 
if included in the statistical analysis plan, the DSMB will also review formal interim 
analyses of the primary end point.  
 
In addition to regular meetings, it may be necessary to convene the DSMB urgently on 
an ad hoc  basis to discuss new data or other information that raises questions about 
equipoise, safety, or anything else in the trial.   
 
It is expected that all DSMB members will attend every meeting and conference call.  
Howe ver, it is recognized that this may not always be possible. A quorum for voting is 
half of the standing members plus one. The Board may wish to decide if particular 
expertise is needed within the quorum for a particular meeting. All standing Monitoring 
Board members are voting members.  The Board may decide in advance whether ad 
hoc members can vote.  
 
Discussion of Confidential Material  
 
DSMB meetings and calls will be organized into open, closed, and executive sessions.  
 
• During the open sessions , informati on will be presented to the DSMB by the 
principal investigator or staff at UMB, study investigators, and NHLBI staff as 
appropriate, with time for discussion.  
 
• During the closed sessions , the DSMB , UVA statistician, and NHLBI statistician 
will discuss conf idential data from the study, including information on efficacy and 
safety.  NHLBI’s expectation is that the DSMB will review unmasked data.  If the 
closed session occurs on a conference call, steps will be taken to ensure that 
only the appropriate partici pants are on the call, and to invite others to re -join the 
call only at the conclusion of the closed session.  
 
• The DSMB  may hold an executive session  in which only the DSMB members 
are present. The NHLBI ES may attend the executive session at the invitation of 
the DSMB Chair.  If the ES does not attend the executive session, the DSMB 
Chair will be responsible for summarizing the DSMB’s discussion and 
recommendations to the ES.   
 
Voting on recommendations will follow Robert’s Rules of Order . 
 
At the conclusion of the closed and executive sessions, the DSMB  chair may provide a 
summary of the preliminary recomm endations to the lead investigators and masked 
NHLBI staff to provide an opportunity for study investigators, the PI, and NHLBI to ask 
27 
 questions to clarify the recommendations.  Recommendations that would unmask 
results, such as a recommendation to close a  study prematurely, should not be 
disclosed until approved by NHLBI leadership.  The meeting is then adjourned.  
 
 
Reports of DSMB Deliberations  
 
• Formal minutes:  The NHLBI ES is responsible for preparation and transmission 
of the formal DSMB minutes to the Director of the applicable Division within 14 
calendar days of each meeting or call .  Minutes will document whether there is 
conflict of interest on the part of Board members and will summarize the key 
points of the discussion and debate, requests for additional information, response 
of the investigators to previous recommendations, and the recommendations 
from the current meeting.   
• Following division review, the minutes are sent to:  
 
o DSMB  Chair, who approves them on behalf of the DSMB  
o Division of Lung  Diseases Director, NHLBI, for final Institute approval  
 
• Once the Division of Lung Diseases Director, NHLBI  has approved the minutes, 
they are considered final.  
• Recommendations of the Board are sent to the primary study investigator(s) and 
may be included in the materials for the subsequent DSMB meeting.  
• Reports to IRB:  The NHLBI program office will prepare a Summary Report and 
submit it to primary study investigators within 30 calendar days of each meeting.  
Primary study investigators will forward the Su mmary Report to the IRB.  
• If the DSMB does not identify any safety or other protocol -related concerns, the 
Summary Report will state that:  
 
o a review of outcome data, adverse events, and information relating to 
study  
performance (e.g., data timeliness, completeness, and quality) across all 
centers took place on a given date  
o the observed frequency of adverse events did not exceed what was 
expected and indicated in the informed consent;  
o a review of recent literature relevant to the research too k place, and;  
o the DSMB recommended that the study continue without modification of 
the protocol or informed consent  
 
• If the DSMB does identify concerns, the NHLBI staff will distribute,  as soon as 
feasible, preferably within 7 calendar days of the DSMB mee ting, the Summary 
Report as outlined above, outlining the concerns and the basis for any 
recommendations that the DSMB has made in response to the concerns. 
Adverse event reporting will be consistent with NHLBI policy .   
 
 
28 
 Reports to the DSMB  
 
For each meeting, unbli nded analyses and reports will be prepared by the DSMB 
statistician as this is a double blinded study and the PI and study staff will not have 
access to the data required to prepare these reports. Reports will be prepared 
according to the DSMB’s recommenda tions  regarding which data should be presented 
and the format of the data presentation.  
 
Statistical Monitoring Guidelines  
 
The DSMB  will review the adequacy of the statistical monitoring plan.  The final plan, 
whether part of a research protocol or separate document, will be maintained as an 
appendix to this Charter.  The DSMB should discuss the statistical monitoring 
procedures that will be followed to guide recommendations about termination or 
continuation of the trial .  These procedures could inclu de guidelines for termination due 
to safety reasons.    
 
ADVERSE EVENTS AND REPORTING  
This section defines the types of safety data that will be collected under this protocol 
and outlines the procedures for appropriately collecting, recording and reporting those 
data.   
Definitions  
Adverse Event  
For the purposes of this protocol, an adverse event will be defined as any adverse 
medical change (i.e., de novo or increased severity in a preexisting condition) from the 
subject’s baseline condition, that occurs during the course of the clinical study, after 
receiving Regadenoson infusion through Day 30, whether considered device related or 
not and meeting the protocol requirements.  
Anticipated symptoms caused by the COVID -19 infection and standard care are  
expected to occur between time of Regadenoson infusion and Day 30. The following 
are examples of anticipated events caused by the COVID -19 infection and standard 
care are medications not considered AE’s:  
• Fever   
• Incubation related inflammation, sour throa t   
• Shortness of breath   
• Pneumonia  
• Renal insufficiencies secondary to medications  
• Sleep issues (insomnia)  
• Gastrointestinal discomfort (i.e. constipation, decreased appetite, diarrhea)  
• Pulmonary observations (i.e. wheezing, cough)  
• Neurological observat ions (i.e. hallucinations, confusion)  
• Renal observations (i.e. urinary tract infections, urinary retention)  
29 
 • There may be additional expected events not listed which may be documented in 
the patient’s medical record by the investigator.  
The events above are not considered adverse events for this study and will not be 
recorded.  
Serious Adverse Event  
• A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is one that:  
• Leads to death;  
• Leads to serious deterioration in the health of the study patient that:  
o Results in life -threatening illness or injury;  
o Results in a permanent impairment of a body structure or a body function;  
o Requires in patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing 
hospitalization;  
o Results in medical or surgical intervention to prevent  permanent 
impairment to body structure or a body function;  
• Results in congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• Significant medical event.  
NOTE: A planned hospitalization for a pre -existing condition, or anticipated procedures 
such as routine transplant related biopsy or elective surgery will not be considered 
serious adverse events.  
Note that seriousness and severity are separate concepts. The term “severe” refers to 
the intensity of a specific event; a severe event may be of minor medical significance 
(e.g., a severe leg cramp). The term “serious” is based on an outcome or action criteria 
that are usually associated with events that pose a threat to the patient’s life or 
functioning. An event that is mild in severity is serious if it leads to one of the outcomes 
defined above.  
Unanticipated problem  involving risks to subjects or others (UP) - Any incident, 
experience or outcome that meets al l the following criteria:  
• Unexpected (in terms of nature, severity, or frequency) given:  
• The research procedures that are described in the protocol related -documents, 
such the IRB -approved research protocol and the informed consent form 
document and,  
• The c haracteristics of the subject population being studied;  
• Related or possibly related to the subject participation in research; and  
30 
 • Suggests that the research places subjects or others at a greater risk of harm 
(including physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) related to the 
research than was previously known or recognized.  
Grading of Adverse Events – Events will be graded by using the Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Criteria version 4.0 3. 
Attribution Assessment  
Attribution  – the determination and documentation of whether an adverse event is 
related to Regadenoson infusion.  
Attribution Categories : 
1. Not Related – Event clearly related to other factors (e.g., clinical state, 
other therapies; concomitant drugs)  
2. Possibly Related – Sequence of event is compatible with device, or 
procedure, but could have been produced by other factors  
3. Probably Related - Sequence of event is compatible with device, or 
procedure and cannot be explained by other factors without much 
doubt  
4. Definitely R elated - Sequence of event is compatible with device or 
procedure and beyond doubt cannot be explained by other factors  
Severity  
The degree of severity of the AE to the subject’s health will be documented on the AE 
CRF.   
Grade 1 Mild; asymptomatic or mild  symptoms; clinical or diagnostic  
observations only; intervention not  indicated.  
Grade 2 Moderate; minimal, local or  noninvasive intervention indicated;  limiting  
age-appropriate  instrumental ADL.  
Grade 3 Severe or medically significant but  not immediately life -threatening;  
hospitalization or prolongation of  hospitalization indicated; disabling;  limiting self -
care ADL.  
  Grade 4 Life -threatening consequences;  urgent intervention indicated.  
  Grade 5 Death related to AE.  
Unanticipated Adverse Devi ce Effect (UADE)  
A UADE is any serious adverse effect on health or safety, any life -threatening problem 
or death caused by, or associated with a device, if that effect, problem, or death was not 
previously identified in nature, severity, or degree of incid ence in the investigational plan 
(e.g., ICF, Study Protocol, Instructions for Use (IFU), publications, etc.) or any other 
31 
 unanticipated serious problem associated with a device that relates to the rights, safety, 
or welfare of subjects.  
Adverse Event Recor ding  
All adverse events will be collected starting at time of infusion  through POD 30.  Events 
that meet the definition of “anticipated” (see section 8.1.1) will not be recorded as 
adverse events unless the event meets the criteria of a Serious Adverse Eve nt.  
Adverse events should be recorded on a case report form and will be assessed for 
seriousness, severity, attribution and expectedness by the site Principal Investigator.    
Reporting Requirements  
Expedited Reporting  
The following events require expedited reporting , i.e., notification to the study 
monitoring team within 24 hours and DSMB and NHLBI within at least 7 calendar days 
of learning of the event’s occurrence:  
• All Serious Adverse Events that are at least possib ly related/associated with the 
study device.  
• All unanticipated problems and unanticipated adverse device effects that occur 
within 30 days of Regadenoson infusion.  
• All (fatal) events within 30 days of Regadenoson infusion.  
Efforts should be made to repo rt expedited events to the DSMB and NHLBI as soon as 
possible but within at least 7 days.  All other events will be recorded in the electronic 
data capture system.  
Events that require expedited reporting must be reported by email or telephone within 
24 hou rs to:  
Office of Accountability and Compliance  
University of Maryland, Baltimore  
410-706-2281  
oac@umaryland.edu  
Expedited reports will also be submitted to the DSMB and NHLBI (see Table 4) within 7 
calendar days of learning of the event’s occurrence.  
Reporting to the UMB HSR -IRB and DSMB   
The Principal Investigator or designee is responsible for reporting SAEs and 
unanticipated problems to the site IRB according to the participating site institutional 
guidelines .

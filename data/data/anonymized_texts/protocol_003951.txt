Objective
The
objectives
of
this
non-significant
risk
(NSR)
study
are
to
evaluate
the
safety
of
the
short
term
placement
of
the

INTRODUCTION
1 . 1
B a c k g r o u n d
a n d
r a t i o n a l e
Neuromodulation,
sometimes
referred
to
as
Bioelectronic
Medicine,
is
using
electrical
stimulation
or
blocking
of
neural
activity
to
achieve
beneficial
effects
in
the
human
body.
These
effects
can
include
the
reduction
of
chronic
pain,
reducing
the
frequency
of
overactive
bladder,
epileptic
events,
up
to
a
modulation
of
the
metabolic
activity
of
inner
organs.
In
many
cases,
afferent
and
efferent
nerves
of
interest
for
interfacing
are
located
within
5
cm
when
measured
from
the
surface
of
the
skin.
Unfortunately,
extracorporeal
means
of
modulating
neural
activity
in
these
nerves
cannot
be
achieved
reliably
by
widely
available
technologies
such
as
Transcutaneous
Electrical
Nerve
Stimulation
(TENS)
as
the
electric
field
applied
on
the
outside
of
the
skin
only
penetrates
a
few
millimeters
into
the
body
before
current
densities
have
dissipated
enough
to
limit
the
ability
to
reliably
activate
or
deactivate
neural
tissue.
In
order
to
electrically
interface
with
these
nerves,
the
clinical
standard
today
is
to
place
an
implantable
pulse
form
generator
(IPG)
into
the
patient,
followed
by
one
or
more
electrodes
connecting
the
IPG
to
the
nerve
of
interest
by
means
of
an
open
cut-down
procedure.
This
often
requires
general
anesthesia,
a
surgeon
to
place
the
devices,
and
commonly
results
in
significant
scarring
visible
post
surgery
as
well
as
a
large
burden
on
the
payer
in
the
healthcare
system
for
the
cost
of
the
extensive
procedure.

Today,
individuals
suffering
from
chronic
intractable
pain
of
the
trunk
and/or
limbs
are
typically
treated
on
a
continuum
with
less
invasive
therapies
prescribed
first.
Established,
non-surgical
treatment
options
include,
but
are
not
limited
to,
oral
medications
including
opioid-based
drugs,
physical
therapy,
TENS,
acupuncture,
nerve
blocks,
radiofrequency
ablation
and
other
options
based
on
clinical
judgment.
The
surgical
treatment
options
for
these
study
participants
include
surgery
of
the
spine,
sympathectomy,
intrathecal
drug
pumps,
and
spinal
cord
stimulation
(SCS)
systems
.

Neuromodulation
offers
many
treatment
solutions
to
pathologies
such
as
Parkinson’s
Disease,
peripheral
nerve
pain,
overactive
bladder
(OAB)
and
neuralgia
among
others.
Current
solutions
are
divided
between
invasive,
minimally
invasive
and
non-invasive
treatments
and
each
come
with
their
own
set
of
challenges
and
benefits.
Invasive
treatments
generally
require
surgery
under
anesthesia
to
place
signal
generators,
leads
and
electrodes,
often
resulting
in
visible
scars
and
are
the
most
expensive
treatment
option.
Non-invasive
treatments
typically
have
the
least
efficacy,
reliability
problems,
limited
applicability
to
a
few
locations
and
no
ability
to
block
nerves.
Only
few
invasive
treatments
exist
and
those
generally
require
a
bulky
external
signal
generator,
and
often
don’t
provide
the
option
to
place
an
electrode
as
a
cuff
around
a
nerve,
a
necessary
requirement
for
optimal
mechanical
and
electrical
interfacing
for
the
long
term.
For
many
potential
applications
that
could
be
treated

neuromodulation
technology,
nerves
of
interest
are
located
deeper
than
5
mm
when
measured
from
the
surface
of
the
skin.
This
limitation
of
non-invasive
TENS
technology
to
nerves
only
very
close
to
the
skin
is
greatly
holding
back
the
development
of
novel
treatments
using
neuromodulation.
There
is
a
need
for
a
technology
that
conducts
an
externally
generated
signal
to
a
nerve
of
interest
to
locations
from
just
beneath
the
skin
to
a
target
nerve
at
a
depth
of
up
to
5cm.

The
future
of
neuromodulation
is
expected
to
become
more
patient
centric
and
will
focus
on
various
unserved
needs
patients
have
today.
One
of
these
needs
is
to
be
free
from
the
need
to
undergo
revision
surgeries
every
3
to
7
years
to
replace
an
exhausted
battery
by
explanting
an
old
neuromodulation
device
and
reimplanting
a
new
one
in
its
place.
In
addition,
a
second
need
is
to
minimize
the
prevalence
and
size
of
scars
caused
by
the
surgery
to
place
first
an
electrode
on
a
nerve
target
and
second
the
scar
caused
by
the
placement
of
the
signal
generator.
Neuronoff,
Inc.
set
out
to
provide
a
solution
to
both
of
these
needs
by
electrically
connecting
the
nerve
with
an
insert
that
can
be
delivered
via
needle
puncture
to
minimize
scarring
.
The
insert
functions
as
2
an
electrical
conduit
(coupler),
transferring
current
applied
to
the
skin
(e.g.
via
TENS)
via
a
very
low
impedance
down
to
the
nerve
of
interest
(figure
1).
In
essence,
this
conduit
provides
the
last
mile
connection
for
electrical
signals
from
the
skin
to
the
target
nerve.

Product

While
electrical
energy 
applied
by
a
TENS
unit
does
only
reach
approximately
3
to
5
mm
deep
(A),
a
low
impedance
conduit
(B)
can
conduct 
electrical
energy
to
a
location
more
distant
inside
the
body
to
activate
a
nerve
(C).
The
BASMA TI
insert
is
manufactured 
following
similar
procedures
and
from
the
same
materials
as
the
expected
Target
product,
thus
providing
an
assessment
of
the 
safety
(primary
objective
assessed
in
this
study)
and
interfacing
efficacy
(secondary
objective)
of
the
technology .

Preclinical
animal
and
benchtop
work
has
been
successfully
conducted
to
prove
out
the
technology.
The
conduit
placement
is
designed
to
be
very
similar
to
a
lidocaine
injection
pain
physicians
provide
as
part
of
their
daily
practice
today,
utilizing
fluoroscopic
or
ultrasound
visualization
during
the
procedure.
Using
a
needle
of
2
to
5
mm
diameter
as
a
trocar,
a
wire
rope
is
inserted
to
be
in
close
proximity
to
the
nerve
at
one
end
of
the
conduit,
while
the
other
(“current
collector”)
end
is
left
as
a
loop
in
the
subcutaneous
tissue.
After
closing
the
puncture
wound
with
steri
strips
or
sutures,
the
patient
will
be
allowed
to
recover
for
a
few
days,
allowing
the
injected
conduit
to
stabilize.
After
a
few
days
of
recovery,
electrical
current
to
stimulate
the
nerve
is
applied
on
the
outside
of
the
skin
with
a
TENS
unit,
from
where
it
reaches
the
collector
end
just
below
the
skin.
Once
the
current
reaches
the
collector
end,
it
is
transferred
at
a
very
low
electrical
impedance
to
the
nerve
target,
providing
the
neuromodulation
treatment.
The
advantages
of
this
solution
are
(1)
that
the
signal
generator
is
outside
the
body,
eliminating
the
need
for
battery
replacement
surgeries
and
(2)
that
the
puncture
wound
to
place
the
conduit
leaves
a
significantly
smaller
scar
than
current
procedures
to
place
neuromodulation
electrodes,
leads
and
signal
generators.
This
conduit
represents
an
injectable
electrode
that
is
formed
into
its
final
shape
inside
the
body,
or
Injectrode
for
short.
While
Neuronoff,
Inc.
has
tested
all
components
of
this
system
in
preclinical
benchtop
and
animal
studies,
including
very
successful
long
term
biocompatibility
studies
of
the
actual
Injectrode
insert
for
up
to
180
days,
it
was
deemed
to
be
in
the
best
interest
of
study
participants
and
the
company
to
conduct
the
clinical
work
in
two
subsequent
clinical
studies
that
build
on
top
of
each
other:
First
a
clinical
study
to
document
the
safety
and
electrical
interfacing
efficacy
of
the
Injectrode
insert
for
up
to
28
days.
This
early
feasibility
study
focuses
primarily
on
documenting
biocompatibility
by
having
the
Injectrode
insert
placed
just
below
the
skin
into
the
subcutaneous
tissue.
Based
on
extensive
chronic
work
in
animals
a
rejection
reaction
is
not
expected,
but
if
it
were
to
happen,
would
be
very
easily
dealt
with
by
explanting
the
small
insert.
After
28
days,
a
short
electrical
measurement
would
be
used
to
confirm
successful
interfacing
with
the
device
just
minutes
prior
to
removal
by
a
dermatologic
surgeon.
This
study
design
allows
for
risk
to
be
very
minimal,
enabling
the
NSR
designation
for
this
study.
The
document
in
hand
describes
this
first
study.
The
second
clinical
study
is
designed
to
build
on
the
knowledge
of
the
successful
first
study
and
will
evaluate
the
deployment
of
a
longer
version
of
the
Injectrode
insert
from
a
subcutaneous
location
to
a
nerve
at
a
depth
of
approximately
one
inch
in
depth
measured
from
the
skin.
The
second
study
thus
represents
an
actual
treatment
efficacy
study
for
a
clinical
condition.
This
second
clinical
study
is
a
future
study
and
not
the
one
described
in
the
document
in

While
interfacing
with
a
nerve
at
a
depth
of
2
to
3
cm
would
be
a
possibility
for
an
early
feasibility
study,
it
was
determined
that
a
subcutaneous
placement
of
the
shortened
study
device
would
provide
the
same
biocompatibility
data
and
the
same
electrical

capabilities
efficacy
data,
while
subjecting
the
study
participants
to
a
very
minimal
and
controlled
amount
of
Non-Significant
Risk
(NSR).
Under
21
CFR
812.3(m),
an
NSR
device
study
is
one
that
does
*not*
meet
the
definition
for
an
SR
device
study.
Below
we
cover
all
criteria
that
define
an
SR
device
and
then
detail
why
the
Basmati
Injectrode
does
*not*
meet
these.
Specifically,
as
per
21
CFR
812.3(m),
an
SR
device:
1.
Is
intended
as
an
implant
and
presents
a
potential
serious
risk
to
the
health,
safety,
or
welfare
of
a
subject.
The
commercial
version
of
Neurnoff’s
Injectrode
will
be
an
implantable
electrode.
However,
this
early
feasibility
prototype
is
limited
to
28
days
of
use
to
avoid
risk
resulting
from
long-term
implantation
duration
where
regular
follow-up
is
impractical
or
impossible.
Therefore,
the
Basmati
insert
does
not
meet
the
definition
of
an
implant.
In
this
study,
the
Basmati
will
be
used
to
document
the
clinical
biological
response
after
a
placement
duration
of
28
days
only.
According
to
FDA
guidance
,
“Use
of
International
Standard
ISO
10993,
“Biological
Evaluation
of
Medical
Devices
Part
1:
Evaluation
and
Testing”
(2013):
a
device
that
makes
contact
with
tissue
for
a
period
of
time
less
than
30
days
poses
considerably
lower
risk
to
patients
.
2.
Is
purported
or
represented
to
be
for
use
supporting
or
sustaining
human
life
and
presents
a
potential
for
serious
risk
to
the
health,
safety,
or
welfare
of
a
subject.
The
Basmati
Injectrode
insert
is
not
intended
for
use
supporting
or
sustaining
human
life
.
In
the
proposed
safety
study,
the
device
will
be
temporarily
implanted
subcutaneously
for
the
purpose
of
confirming
its
biocompatibility
compared
to
a
previous
animal
study.
3.
Is
for
a
use
of
substantial
importance
in
diagnosing,
curing,
mitigating,
or
treating
disease,
or
otherwise
preventing
impairment
of
human
health
and
presents
a
potential
for
serious
risk
to
the
health,
safety,
or
welfare
of
a
subject.
In
the
proposed
safety
study,
the
Basmati
insert
will
be
used
as
a
passive
device
not
intended
for
diagnosing,
curing,
mitigating,
or
treating
disease,
or
otherwise
preventing
impairment
of
human
health
.
Prior
to
removing
the
device
in
a
minimally
invasive
procedure,
the
Injectrode
will
be
briefly
interfaced
with
electrical
current
using
standard
electro-acupuncture
techniques,
following
the
labeling
for
these
approved
devices.
The
total
time
of
exposure
to
this
limited
stimulation
period
will
be
approximately
20
minutes
right
prior
to
device
extraction
via
Mohs
procedure.
4.
Otherwise
presents
a
potential
for
serious
risk
to
the
health,
safety,
or
welfare
of
a
subject.
Based
on
the

according
with
the
ISO-14971

Standard
to
assure
that
the
Basmati
Injectrode
insert
is
deemed
to
not
represent
any
potential
for
serious
risk
to
the
health,
safety,
or
welfare
of
a
subject.
The
minimally
invasive
placement
at
a
location
in
the
subcutaneous
tissue
and
rigorous
follow-up
schedule
are
designed
to
allow
the
physician
to
monitor
the
response
of
each
study
participant
very
closely
and,
if
necessary,
explant
the
device
prior
to
the
28
day
mark
without
unnecessary
risk
to
the
health,
safety,
or
welfare
of
a
subject.
The
material
of
the
Injectrode
is
99.99%
gold,
a
material
commonly
used
in
neuromodulation
electrodes
that
is
bioinert
and
very
well
received
by
humans
clinically
.
The
method
of
removing
the
Injectrode
at
the
end
of
the
safety
study
will
follow
a
procedure
similar
to
a
Mohs
procedure,
a
standard
clinical
practice
that
poses
little
risk
to
study
subjects.
Subjects
will
be
followed
for
signs
of
inflammation
of
the
surgical
site,
granulomas,
irritation.
This
early
feasibility
study
aims
to
document
the
clinical
biological
response
to
an
Injectrode,
roughly
the
size
of
a
Basmati
rice
grain,
placed
temporarily
into
up
to
10
healthy
volunteers
for
a
duration
of
up
to
28
days.
The
efficacy
of
the
device
is
assessed
by
measuring
electrical
and
sensory
nerve
recruitment
data
immediately
prior
to
explanting
the
device.
These
data
are
intended
to
provide
rationale
for
a
follow-up
study
testing
a
therapeutic
intervention.
Risk
to
the
study
participant
is
further
minimized
by
placing
the
study
device
subcutaneously
with
the
option
for
a
quick
minimally
invasive
explant
procedure
before
the
28
day
mark
if
deemed
necessary
by
the
study
PI.
This
non-significant
risk
(NSR)
study
is
the
first
of
two
early
feasibility
studies.
This
first
NSR
study
is
designed
to
subject
the
study
participants
to
a
minimal
risk
while
collecting
first
human
biocompatibility,
electrical
interface
and
neurostimulation
data.
The
expected
data
set
is
designed
to
enable
a
follow-up
study
investigating
the
placement
of
a
longer
Basmati-style
Injectrode
that
ranges
from
the
subcutaneous
tissue
to
a
nerve
located
at
an
approximate
depth
of
2
to
3
cm
deep
inside
the
body.
The
present
BASMATI
study
mimics
the
placement
into
the
subcutaneous
tissue
location
and
thereby
provides
the
data
to
enable
the
follow-up
study
evaluating
a
longer
Basmati-like
electrode
to
be
placed.
To
minimize
risk
for
participants
in
the
mentioned
follow-up
study,
biocompatibility
data
and
electrical
interfacing
data
are
collected
in
the
first
NSR
study
as
described
in
the
document
in

The
Basmati
Injectrode
will
be
placed
subcutaneously
in
up
to
10
healthy
volunteers
for
a
duration
of
up
to
28
days.
On
the
last
day
of
the
study,
the
Basmati
Injectrode
will
be
explanted
with
a
margin
of
approximately
1mm
of
healthy
tissue
utilizing
a
Mohs
surgical
approach,
ensuring
maximal
study
participant
safety
while
enabling
the
collection
of
histological
samples
for
chronic
human
biocompatibility
data.
Just
prior
to
explanting
the
device,
two
very
small
30

(similar
to
electro-acupuncture
needles)
will
be
placed
approximately
5mm
into
the

at
the
location
of
the
subcutaneously
placed
Basmati,
thereby
forming
an
electrical
interface
with
the
Basmati.
Electrical
impedance
and
stimulation
thresholds
for
subcutaneous

will
be
recorded
with

This
approach
is
similar
to
that
utilized
with
the
StimRouter
Neuromodulation
System,
which
also
consists
of
an
implanted
lead
with
external
stimulation
equipment
to
activate
the
lead
transcutaneously
.
Both
systems
utilize
minimally
invasive
implantation
techniques,
with
the
probe
injected
via
3

hollow
stainless
steel
tubes
.
However,
the
Injectrode
is
different
in
that
it
is
presented
as
a
gold
mesh

as
opposed
to
a
fixed
metal
coil,
which
allows
for
improved
in-body
conforming
and
thus
better
reach
of
potentially
hard-to-access
anatomic
targets.
Also,
in
the
least
invasive
use
case,
the
Injectrode
can
be
stimulated
via
an
external
TENS
unit
without
requiring
an
implanted
stimulation
cable.
Thus,
the
Injectrode
offers
improved
placement
potential
and
functionality
with
similar
or
lesser
invasiveness
than
available
technologies.

Accordingly,
the
devices
chosen

were
selected
for
their

Stimulation
will
be
controlled
using
an
FDA

Impedance
will
be

that
is

conclusions:
There

capsule
formation,
with
the
most
prominent
finding
being
the
expected
inflammatory
response
to
any

material.
The
fibrotic
response
was
variable
–
some
devices
had
a
higher
degree
of
inflammatory
and
foreign
body
giant
cells
than
others.
Responses
range
from
+1
to
+3
(mild
to
moderate)
responses,
the
histopathologist
stating
that
this
range
did
not
seem
concerning
and
that
he
assumed
it
to
simply
be
inter-subject
variability.
He
cited
the
variable
response
of
patients
to
COVID
as
a
case-in-point.
There
was
no
evidence
of
adverse
granuloma,
necrosis
(e.g.,
no
acute

tumor
formation
or
infection.

OUTCOMES
The
outcomes
of
the
study
are
focused
on
collecting
data
to
determine
clinical
outcomes
of
placing
the
Basmati
Injectrode
for
up
to
28
days
in
healthy
study
participants
to
1)
assess
tissue
responses
and,
on
the
last
day
just
prior
to
explant,
2)
collect
data
describing
the
quality
of
the
electrical
interfacing
with
the
Injectrode
from
outside
of
the
body,
as
well
as
with
subcutaneous
sensory
nerves
surrounding
the
Injectrode
insert.
Safety
data
will
also
be
collected
at
all
visits.
Data
will
be
collected
using:
●
True
color
images
of
the
surgical
site
and
the
insert
placement
location.
●
Ultrasound
and
fluoroscopy
(x-ray)
images
of
the
insert
placement
location.
●
CRFs
to
capture
any
pain
or
discomfort,
AEs
and
UPs.
●
Patho-histological
data
from
tissue
samples
collected
during
the
explant
procedure
(Injectrode
with
approximately
0.5

Once
the
informed
consent
has
been
documented,
the
study
participant's
eligibility
for
study
participation
is
verified
at
the
Enrollment
Visit.
During
this
assessment,
the
study
physician
will
collect
and
document
each
potential
participant’s
relevant
medical
history
(including
diagnosis),
demographics
and
physical
examination
results.
The
visit
concludes
with
the
placement
of
the
allergy
skin
test
patch
on
the
arm
of
the
study
participant.
The
gold
allergy
skin
test
patch
is
essentially
a
small
band-aid
filled
with
gold
salt.
According
to
the
test’s
instruction
for
use,
the
patch
must
be
placed
on
the
skin
for
two
to
three
days
prior
to
an
additional
waiting
period
of
two
more
days
before
the
skin
reaction
can
be
interpreted
by
the
physician.
Accordingly,
the
next
two
visits
are
scheduled
with
the
study
participant
as
(1)
a
phone
call
to
remove
the
skin
test
while
creating
a
record
in
the
corresponding
CRF
(see
9.1.4
below)
and

INSERT
PLACEMENT
VISIT
(IN-PERSON,
day
0)
The
Insert
Placement
Visit
begins
with
an
examination
of
the
study
participant’s
arm
to
capture
and
interpret
the
result
of
the
gold
allergy
skin
test
by
the
physician.
Once
the
absence
of
a
gold
allergy
is
verified,
the
participant
advances
to
the
group
of
up
to
10
participants
that
will
receive
the
Basmati
Injectrode
insert.
Appropriately
trained
field
staff
will
assist
as
necessary
with
the
Basmati
Injectrode
insert
procedure.
The
recommended
placement
location
for
the
device
on
the
left
or
the
right
hip
region
(figure
6)
will
be
determined
by
the
physician
and
documented
on
the
CRF.
Figure
6:
Depiction
of
the
surgical
location
(arrows).
Placement
of
the
Basmati
Injectrode
is
the
hip
region
of
the
study
participant
at
approximately
the
height
of
the
naval.
Prior
to
the
placement
of
the
insert,
the
surgical
location
near
the
hip,
approximately
at
the
height
of
the
naval,
is
cleaned
and
sterilized
following
standard
OR
procedures
(betadine,
70%
isopropyl
alcohol).
Following
an
injection
of
subcutaneous
lidocaine
(1%),
a
small
(~5mm)
incision
is
made
using
a
scalpel
followed
by
blunt
dissection
of
the
subcutaneous
tissue.
Blunt
dissection
technique
is
used
to
create
a
tunnel
of
about
3-5
mm
diameter,
at
a
depth
of
approximately
2mm
measured
from
the
surface
of
the
skin,
and
up
to
2
cm
long
(
figure
7,
A
).

Basmati
Injectrode
insert.
Using
the
deployment
device,
the
Basmati
Injectrode
is
placed
into
the
distal
end
of
the
tunnel,
leaving
a
length
of
approximately
1
cm
of
empty
tunnel
between
the
Basmati
and
the
skin
incision
(
Figure

).
At
the
clinician's
discretion,
pressure
to
the
wound
channel
alone
or
surgical
glue
may
be
used
to
ensure
proper
adherence
of
the
tunnel
walls
to
close

EFFICACY
&
EXPLANT
VISIT
(IN-PERSON,
day
28)
This
visit
has
two
parts.
The
total
duration
of
this
visit
is
expected
to
be
approximately
1
hour.
The
first
part
of
the
visit
is
focused
on
capturing
stimulation
thresholds
of
cutaneous
afferent
nerves
to
provide
information
about
the
Injectode’s
capabilities
to
conduct
current
at
low
electrical
impedance
values.
This
first
part
is
anticipated
to
last
for
approximately
30
minutes
and
scheduled
to
occur
just
before
the
explant
of
the
Basmati
Injectrode
insert.
The
second
part
of
the
visit
is
the
actual
explant
of
the
device
that
will
then
be
sent
to
histopathology
for
further
processing.
This
second
part
is
anticipated
to
last
for
approximately
30
minutes
and
will
include
image
capturing
for
purposes
of
documentation.
Part
I:
Impedance
and
stimulation
threshold
data
acquisition
Materials:
Stimulation
will
be
provided
using
a
DS7A
Constant
Current
Stimulator
unit
(Digitimer),
a
device
with
CE
and
FDA
clearance.
Electrical
impedance
will
be
measured
with
a
handheld,
battery-powered
oscilloscope
(Fluke
ScopeMeter)
that
is
certified
and
calibrated.
Sterile
clinical
grade
standard
needles
intended
for
single
patient
use
(30
gauge)
will
be
used
to
directly
interface
percutaneously
with
the
Injectrode.
Details
for
this
interfacing
approach
are
provided
below.
A
clinical
grade,
disposable,
surface
patch
electrode
will
be
used
as
a
distal
return,
referred
to
as
a
TENS
electrode/patch
in
this
document.
The
Stimulator,
Oscilloscope,
Needles
and
TENS
electrodes
will
be
connected
together
using
standard
leads
(Pamona,
Comed).
Methods:
The
setup
for
these
stimulation
and
impedance
tests
are
done
under
two
types
of
visualization.
First,
visualization
is
done
via
ultrasound
according
to
a
Mohs’
surgery
plan.
Second,
the
setup
is
visualized
with
fluoroscopy
to
ensure
that
the
needles
are
placed
precisely
within
the
subcutaneously
implanted
Basmati
Injectrode.
All
equipment
will
be
turned
on
prior
to
use,
followed
by
connecting
the
Stimulator
in
parallel
to
the
Oscilloscope
as
shown
in
Figures
7a
through
7e
below.
Data
will
be
recorded
for
every
measurement.
Prior
to
beginning
the
measurements,
test
leads
will
also
be
hooked
up
to
the
stimulator
in
parallel.
Generally,
measurements
during
this
visit
will
be
recorded
at
a
current
amplitude
ranging
between
0.1
and
10
mA
and
pulse
widths
ranging
from
50
µsec
to
1500
µsec.
Reference
impedance
values
will
be
recorded
at
a
current
amplitude
at
1mA
and
a
pulse
width
of
200
µsec
using
a
reference
resistor
of
1
kOhm.
The
sensory
stimulation
thresholds
(“Measurement
1”
through
“Measurement
3.3”)
below
will
be
conducted
with
a
preferred
pulse
width
of
100
µsec
and
200
µsec,
and,
if
need
be,
may
be
measured
once
more
with
a
different
pulse
width
in
the
range
between
50
µsec
to
1500
µsec
to
be
able
to
capture
stable
measurements.
In
order
to
record
sensory
afferent
nerve
responses
to
electrical
stimulation,
it
is
imperative
that
lidocaine
is
not
injected
at
the
site
of
the
Injectrode
for
the
entity
of
part
1.

Injectrode
is
cleaned
using
70%
Isopropyl
alcohol
at
the
site
of
the
Injectrode
with
a
margin
of
3cm
around
the
site,
identified
via
palpation
of
the
skin.
Two
30
gauge
needles
are
inserted
through
the
cleaned
skin
into
the
Injectrode
as
shown
in
Figures
8a
through
8e.
At
a
location
1-2cm
away
from
the
Injectrode,
a
third
30
gauge
needle
will
be
inserted
as
shown
in
Figure
8a.
Finally,
at
a
location
approximately
10
cm
away
from
the
Injectrode,
a
TENS
patch
electrode
will
be
placed
to
function
as
the
return
electrode
for
electrical
current.
Test
leads
with
hooked
ends
will
be
attached
to
the
needle
shaft
extending
out
of
the
skin
and
taped
to
the
skin
to
keep
the
leads
secure
and
from
pulling
on
the
needles
should
the
study
participant
or
lead
move.
Measurement
1:
Once
the
leads
are
properly
attached
to
the
needles
and
TENS
patch,
testing
may
commence.
The
first
measurement
will
establish
the
stimulation
activation
(sensation)
threshold
of
afferent
nerves
in
the
skin
of
the
hip
region
of
the
study
participant
in
the
vicinity
of
where
the
Injectrode
is
present.
Needle
D
and
TENS
patch
C
will
first
be
connected
to
the
stimulator
(as
shown
in
figure
8a),
and
step
wise
increments
in
stimulus
amplitude
will
be
performed
until
the
study
participant
notes
that
they
can
perceive
the
stimulation
(e.g.
step
size
amplitude
=
100
µA,
pulse
width
=
200
µsec).
The
study
participant
will
be
asked
to
report
when
they
perceive
a
paresthesia,
essentially
a
tingling
sensation
of
the
skin.
The
current
and
pulse
width
values
for
the
initial
report
of
paresthesia
will
be
recorded
and
may
be
verified
with
a
second
measurement.
The
values
allowing
the
study
participant
to
perceive
a
tingling
paresthesia
sensation
are
expected
to
be
an
order
of
magnitude
smaller
than
currents
needed
to
cause
the
perception
of
pain.
If
the
study
participant
reports
pain
during
the
stimulation
then
the
clinician
will
adjust
their
testing
approach
accordingly
to
avoid
such
participant
feedback.
Once
the
stimulation
activation
threshold
is
determined,
lead
D
may
be
unplugged
and
needle
D
removed
from
the
skin.

A
series
of
three
stimulation
tests
will
be
performed
between
the
Injectrode
(A,
B)
and
the
TENS
patch
(C),
as
shown
in
Figures
8c,
8d,
and
8e.
The
first
stimulation
for
each
measurement
will
be
performed
at
or
below
the
stimulation
threshold
established
in
measurement
1
for
the
study
participant.
The
study
participant
will
be
asked
whether
they
sensed
the
stimulus,
and
their
answer
recorded.
If
needed,
the
stimulation
current
will
be
increased
in
increments
of
100
µA
of
current
or
50-100
µsec
of

Measurement
5:
Lastly,
needles
A
and
B
will
be
hooked
up
to
the
stimulator
as
shown
in
Figure
8e.
Electrical
stimulation
at
the
stimulus
activation
threshold
will
be
applied.
The
study
participant
will
be
asked
if
they
still
perceive
the
stimulation
at
threshold.
If
they
do
not,
another
stimulus
activation
threshold
test
will
be
performed
(e.g.
step
size
amplitude
=
100
µA,
pulse
width
=
200
µsec)
up
to
10
mA
of
current.
After
each
stimulation,
the
study
participant
will
be
asked
if
they
perceived
the
stimulation,
with
perception
noted
as
the
stimulus
activation
threshold
of
current
passing
through
the
injectrode.
It
is
expected
that
the
threshold
in
Measurement
5
will
be
at
least
five
times
higher
than
that
recorded
in
Measurement
1,
as
a
result
of
the
conductive
injectrode
shunting
(short-circuiting)
current
between
the
two
needles,
thus
making
it
harder
to
stimulate
nerves
near
the
Injectrode.
Recorded
data
from
the
oscilloscope
will
be
used
to
calculate
the
impedance
of
the
Basmati
Injectrode.

Part
II:
Explant
(Device
Removal)
Methods:
The
explant
surgical
plan
will
be
verified
with
images
from
ultrasound
and
fluoroscopy
taken
earlier
the
same
day.
The
explant
is
a
Mohs
style
surgery.
The
injection
site
is
anesthetized
via
lidocaine
(solution
1%),
and
a
sharp
cut
is
made
above
the
Basmati
Injectrode.
Next,
tissue
forceps
are
used
to
hold
onto
the
device
while
dissection
is
performed
around
the
Injectrode
in
naïve
tissue
at
a
target
distance
of
about
0.5
to
1
mm.
Once
removed,
the
explanted
Basmati
Insert
is
placed
in
a
glass
vial
containing
Formalin
(10%
formaldehyde
solution),
labeled
in
code
with
sequential
numbers
for
each
study
participant
in
compliance
with
HIPAA
requirements.
The
subsequent
wound
is
closed,
in
layers
if
applicable.
The
incision
is
closed
with
steri-strip,
surgical
skin
glue
or
sutures
as
per
the
surgeon’s
discretion.
The
closed
wound
is
then
bandaged
as
per
standard
protocol.
At
no
time
from
explant
to
histological
analysis
report
generation
will
Neuronoff,
Inc.
be
in
possession
of
the
device,
samples,
or
data.
The
device
will
be
left
in
Formalin
for
24
hours,
at
which
time
the
solution
will
be
exchanged
for
70%
ethanol
by
the
clinical
site.
The
fixed
samples
will
then
be
shipped
to
the
following
location,
with
email
notifications
to
Jennifer
Mikulan
(CWRU
Tissue
Resource
Core,
jjm10@case.edu

Once
completed,
the
report
and
samples
will
be
sent
to
Neuronoff,
Inc.
for
safekeeping.
Upon
completion
of
the
explant,
the
site
once
occupied
by
the
Injectrode
is
again
visualized
with
ultrasound,
and
then
again
with
fluoroscopy.
Both
visualizations
will
be
documented.

ADVERSE
EVENT
REPORTING
During
the
study,
the
investigator
will
determine
whether
any
adverse
events
(AE’s)
have
occurred.
For
the
purpose
of
this
protocol,
an
adverse
event
is
any
undesirable
clinical
occurrence
in
a
subject
that
can
be
attributed
to
the
device
or
incision
closure
procedure.
10.1
ADVERSE
EVENTS
In
this
study,
study
participants
should
be
encouraged
to
report
AE’s
spontaneously
or
in
response
to
general,
non-directed
questioning
(e.g.,
“How
has
your
health
been
since
the
last
visit?”)
per
Neuronoff
SOP-38.
Any
time
during
the
study,
the
study
participant
may
volunteer
information
about
any
event
that
resembles
an
AE.
If
it
is
determined
that
an
AE
has
occurred,
the
investigator
should
obtain
all
the
information
required
to
complete
the
AE
Form
of
the
CRF.
The
following
categories
of
adverse
event
severity
are
to
be
used:
Mild
Awareness
of
a
sign
or
symptom
that
does
not
interfere
with
the
study
participant's
usual
activity
or
is
transient,
resolved
without
treatment
and
with
no
sequelae
Moderate
Interferes
with
the
study
participant's
usual
activity
Sever e
Any
fatal
or
immediately
life-threatening
clinical
experience
that
requires
a
subject
to
be
hospitalized,
or
hospitalization
is
unduly
prolonged
because
of
potential
disability
or
danger
to
life
or
because
an
intervention
has
been
necessitated.
This
includes
events
that
cause
fetal
distress,
fetal
death,
congenital
abnormality
or
malignancy
or
any
permanently
disabling
event.

INTRODUCTION
1.
The
World
Medical
Association
has
developed
the
Declaration
of
Helsinki
as
a
statement
of
ethical
principles
to
provide
guidance
to
physicians
and
other
participants
in
medical
research
involving
human
subjects.
Medical
research
involving
human
subjects
includes
research
on
identifiable
human
material
or
identifiable
data.
2.
It
is
the
duty
of
the
physician
to
promote
and
safeguard
the
health
of
the
people.
The
physician's
knowledge
and
conscience
are
dedicated
to
the
fulfillment
of
this
duty.
3.
The
Declaration
of
Geneva
of
the
World
Medical
Association
binds
the
physician
with
the
words,
"The
health
of
my
study
participant
will
be
my
first
consideration,"
and
the
International
Code
of
Medical
Ethics
declares
that,
"A
physician
shall
act
only
in
the
study
participant's
interest
when
providing
medical
care
which
might
have
the
effect
of
weakening
the
physical
and
mental
condition
of
the
study
participant."
4.
Medical
progress
is
based
on
research
which
ultimately
must
rest
in
part
on
experimentation
involving
human
subjects.
5.
In
medical
research
on
human
subjects,
considerations
related
to
the
well-being
of
the
human
subject
should
take
precedence
over
the
interests
of
science
and
society.
6.
The
primary
purpose
of
medical
research
involving
human
subjects
is
to
improve
prophylactic,
diagnostic
and
therapeutic
procedures
and
the
understanding
of
the
aetiology
and
pathogenesis
of
disease.
Even
the
best
proven
prophylactic,
diagnostic,
and
therapeutic
methods
must
continuously
be
challenged
through
research
for
their
effectiveness,
efficiency,
accessibility
and
quality.
7.
In
current
medical
practice
and
in
medical
research,
most
prophylactic,
diagnostic
and
therapeutic
procedures
involve
risks
and
burdens.

Medical
research
is
subject
to
ethical
standards
that
promote
respect
for
all
human
beings
and
protect
their
health
and
rights.
Some
research
populations
are
vulnerable
and
need
special
protection.
The
particular
needs
of
the
economically
and
medically
disadvantaged
must
be
recognized.
Special
attention
is
also
required
for
those
who
cannot
give
or
refuse
consent
for
themselves,
for
those
who
may
be
subject
to
giving
consent
under
duress,
for
those
who
will
not
benefit
personally
from
the
research
and
for
those
for
whom
the
research
is
combined
with
care.
9.
Research
Investigators
should
be
aware
of
the
ethical,
legal
and
regulatory
requirements
for
research
on
human
subjects
in
their
own
countries
as
well
as
applicable
international
requirements.
No
national
ethical,
legal
or
regulatory
requirement
should
be
allowed
to
reduce
or
eliminate
any
of
the
protections
for
human
subjects
set
forth
in
this
Declaration.
2.
BASIC
PRINCIPLES
FOR
ALL
MEDICAL
RESEARCH
1.
It
is
the
duty
of
the
physician
in
medical
research
to
protect
the
life,
health,
privacy,
and
dignity
of
the
human
subject.
2.
Medical
research
involving
human
subjects
must
conform
to
generally
accepted
scientific
principles,
be
based
on
a
thorough
knowledge
of
the
scientific
literature,
other
relevant
sources
of
information,
and
on
adequate
laboratory
and,
where
appropriate,
animal
experimentation.
3.
Appropriate
caution
must
be
exercised
in
the
conduct
of
research
which
may
affect
the
environment,
and
the
welfare
of
animals
used
for
research
must
be
respected.
4.
The
design
and
performance
of
each
experimental
procedure
involving
human
subjects
should
be
clearly
formulated
in
an
experimental
protocol.
This
protocol
should
be
submitted
for
consideration,
comment,
guidance,
and
where
appropriate,
approval
to
a
specially
appointed
ethical
review
committee,
which
must
be
independent
of
the
investigator,
the
sponsor
or
any
other
kind
of
undue
influence.
This
independent
committee
should
be
in
conformity
with
the
laws
and
regulations
of
the
country
in
which
the
research
experiment
is
performed.
The
committee
has
the
right
to
monitor
ongoing
trials.
The
researcher
has
the
obligation
to
provide
monitoring
information
to
the
committee,
especially
any
serious
adverse
events.
The
researcher
should
also
submit
to
the
committee,
for
review,
information
regarding
funding,
sponsors,
institutional
affiliations,
other
potential
conflicts
of
interest
and
incentives
for
subjects.
5.
The
research
protocol
should
always
contain
a
statement
of
the
ethical
considerations
involved
and
should
indicate
that
there
is
compliance
with
the
principles
enunciated
in
this
Declaration.
6.
Medical
research
involving
human
subjects
should
be
conducted
only
by
scientifically
qualified
persons
and
under
the
supervision
of
a
clinically
competent
medical
person.
The
responsibility
for
the
human
subject
must
always
rest
with
a
medically
qualified
person
and
never
rest
on
the
subject
of
the
research,
even
though
the
subject
has
given
consent.
7.
Every
medical
research
project
involving
human
subjects
should
be
preceded
by
careful
assessment
of
predictable
risks
and
burdens
in
comparison
with
foreseeable
benefits

subject
or
to
others.
This
does
not
preclude
the
participation
of
healthy
volunteers
in
medical
research.
The
design
of
all
studies
should
be
publicly
available.
8.
Physicians
should
abstain
from
engaging
in
research
projects
involving
human
subjects
unless
they
are
confident
that
the
risks
involved
have
been
adequately
assessed
and
can
be
satisfactorily
managed.
Physicians
should
cease
any
investigation
if
the
risks
are
found
to
outweigh
the
potential
benefits
or
if
there
is
conclusive
proof
of
positive
and
beneficial
results.
9.
Medical
research
involving
human
subjects
should
only
be
conducted
if
the
importance
of
the
objective
outweighs
the
inherent
risks
and
burdens
to
the
subject.
This
is
especially
important
when
the
human
subjects
are
healthy
volunteers.
10.
Medical
research
is
only
justified
if
there
is
a
reasonable
likelihood
that
the
populations
in
which
the
research
is
carried
out
stand
to
benefit
from
the
results
of
the
research.
11.
The
subjects
must
be
volunteers
and
informed
participants
in
the
research
project.
12.
The
right
of
research
subjects
to
safeguard
their
integrity
must
always
be
respected.
Every
precaution
should
be
taken
to
respect
the
privacy
of
the
subject,
the
confidentiality
of
the
study
participant's
information
and
to
minimize
the
impact
of
the
study
on
the
subject's
physical
and
mental
integrity
and
on
the
personality
of
the
subject.
13.
In
any
research
on
human
beings,
each
potential
subject
must
be
adequately
informed
of
the
aims,
methods,
sources
of
funding,
any
possible
conflicts
of
interest,
institutional
affiliations
of
the
researcher,
the
anticipated
benefits
and
potential
risks
of
the
study
and
the
discomfort
it
may
entail.
The
subject
should
be
informed
of
the
right
to
abstain
from
participation
in
the
study
or
to
withdraw
consent
to
participate
at
any
time
without
reprisal.
After
ensuring
that
the
subject
has
understood
the
information,
the
physician
should
then
obtain
the
subject's
freely-given
informed
consent,
preferably
in
writing.
If
the
consent
cannot
be
obtained
in
writing,
the
non-written
consent
must
be
formally
documented
and
witnessed.
14.
When
obtaining
informed
consent
for
the
research
project
the
physician
should
be
particularly
cautious
if
the
subject
is
in
a
dependent
relationship
with
the
physician
or
may
consent
under
duress.
In
that
case
the
informed
consent
should
be
obtained
by
a
well-informed
physician
who
is
not
engaged
in
the
investigation
and
who
is
completely
independent
of
this
relationship.
15.
For
a
research
subject
who
is
legally
incompetent,
physically
or
mentally
incapable
of
giving
consent
or
is
a
legally
incompetent
minor,
the
investigator
must
obtain
informed
consent
from
the
legally
authorized
representative
in
accordance
with
applicable
law.
These
groups
should
not
be
included
in
research
unless
the
research
is
necessary
to
promote
the
health
of
the
population
represented
and
this
research
cannot
instead
be
performed
on
legally
competent
persons.
16.
When
a
subject
deemed
legally
incompetent,
such
as
a
minor
child,
is
able
to
give
assent
to
decisions
about
participation
in
research,
the
investigator
must
obtain
that
assent
in
addition
to
the
consent
of
the
legally
authorized
representative.

17.
Research
on
individuals
from
whom
it
is
not
possible
to
obtain
consent,
including
proxy
or
advance
consent,
should
be
done
only
if
the
physical/mental
condition
that
prevents
obtaining
informed
consent
is
a
necessary
characteristic
of
the
research
population.
The
specific
reasons
for
involving
research
subjects
with
a
condition
that
renders
them
unable
to
give
informed
consent
should
be
stated
in
the
experimental
protocol
for
consideration
and
approval
of
the
review
committee.
The
protocol
should
state
that
consent
to
remain
in
the
research
should
be
obtained
as
soon
as
possible
from
the
individual
or
a
legally
authorized
surrogate.
18.
Both
authors
and
publishers
have
ethical
obligations.
In
publication
of
the
results
of
research,
the
investigators
are
obliged
to
preserve
the
accuracy
of
the
results.
Negative
as
well
as
positive
results
should
be
published
or
otherwise
publicly
available.
Sources
of
funding,
institutional
affiliations
and
any
possible
conflicts
of
interest
should
be
declared
in
the
publication.
Reports
of
experimentation
not
in
accordance
with
the
principles
laid
down
in
this
Declaration
should
not
be
accepted
for
publication.
3.
ADDITIONAL
PRINCIPLES
FOR
MEDICAL
RESEARCH
COMBINED
WITH
MEDICAL
CARE
1.
The
physician
may
combine
medical
research
with
medical
care,
only
to
the
extent
that
the
research
is
justified
by
its
potential
prophylactic,
diagnostic
or
therapeutic
value.
When
medical
research
is
combined
with
medical
care,
additional
standards
apply
to
protect
the
study
participants
who
are
research
subjects.
2.
The
benefits,
risks,
burdens
and
effectiveness
of
a
new
method
should
be
tested
against
those
of
the
best
current
prophylactic,
diagnostic,
and
therapeutic
methods.
This
does
not
exclude
the
use
of
placebo,
or
no
treatment,
in
studies
where
no
proven
prophylactic,
diagnostic
or
therapeutic
method
exists.
3.
At
the
conclusion
of
the
study,
every
study
participant
entered
into
the
study
should
be
assured
of
access
to
the
best
proven
prophylactic,
diagnostic
and
therapeutic
methods
identified
by
the
study.
4.
The
physician
should
fully
inform
the
study
participant
which
aspects
of
the
care
are
related
to
the
research.
The
refusal
of
a
study
participant
to
participate
in
a
study
must
never
interfere
with
the
study
participant-physician
relationship.
5.
In
the
treatment
of
a
study
participant,
where
proven
prophylactic,
diagnostic
and
therapeutic
methods
do
not
exist
or
have
been
ineffective,
the
physician,
with
informed
consent
from
the
study
participant,
must
be
free
to
use
unproven
or
new
prophylactic,
diagnostic
and
therapeutic
measures,
if
in
the
physician's
judgment
it
offers
hope
of
saving
life,
re-establishing
health
or
alleviating
suffering.
Where
possible,
these
measures
should
be
made
the
object
of
research,
designed
to
evaluate
their
safety
and
efficacy.
In
all
cases,
new
information
should
be
recorded
and,
where
appropriate,
published.
The
other
relevant
guidelines
of
this
Declaration
should
be
followed.

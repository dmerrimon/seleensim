 Page 6 of 39  IRB Version: JAN2016  1.3 State the hypotheses to b e tested, if applicable. 
NOTE:  A hypothesis is a specific, testable prediction about wh at you expect to 
happen in your study that co rresponds with your above listed ob jectives. 
Response: 
 Hypothesis 1:  Dapagliflozin treatment suppresses basal and meal induced oxid ative and 
inflammatory stress in mononuclear  cells (MNC) of patients with  type 2 diabetes.  
Hypothesis 2:  Dapagliflozin acutely  suppresses oxidative and inflammatory stress in MNC of 
patients with type 2 diabetes  
Hypothesis 3 : Treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes with dapagliflozin  will reduce blood 
pressure and increase vasodilato rs and suppress vasoconstrictor s concentrations.  
 
2.0 Scientific Endpoints 
 
2.1    Describe the scientific endpoi nt(s), the main result or occurrence under 
study.   
 
NOTE:  Scientific endpoints are out comes defined before the stu dy begins to determine 
whether the objectives of the stu dy have been met and to draw c onclusions from the data.  
Include primary and secondary endpoints.  Some example endpoint s are:  reduction of 
symptoms, improvement in quality of life, or survival.   Your response should not be a 
date.   
Response:  The primary endpoint of the study is to detect a significant d ifference in the percent 
change in fasting NF κB activation (DNA binding activity) in MNC before and after dap agliflozin 
use (0 week vs. 12 weeks) as compared to placebo. Secondary end points include comparing 
changes in expression of p47phox, SOCS-3, IL-1 , JNK-1, TLR4; and plasma concentrations of 
LPS between dapagliflozin and placebo groups. In addition, plas ma concentrations of TNF- , IL-
6, IL-1, CRP, ANP, b-NP, cGMP, cAMP, angiotensinogen, renin and angiot ensin II will also be 
measured at 0, 6 and 12 weeks following dapagliflozin and chang es will be compared to that in 
the placebo group.    
3.0 Background 
3.1 Provide the scientific or sc holarly background, rationale, and significance of 
the research based on the exist ing literature and how it will c ontribute to 
existing knowledge.  Describe a ny gaps in current knowledge.  I nclude 
relevant preliminary findings or  prior research by the investig ator.  
Response:  Dapagliflozin is an inhibitor of SGLT-2 mediated glucose trans port. This action 
inhibits the reabsorption of glucose from proximal convoluted t ubules and hence induces 
glucosuria. This action has recently been utilized in the treat ment of diabetes since with the 
reduction of renal threshold for glucosuria following the inhib ition of SGLT-2, glucose 
concentration falls. This acti on is independent of insulin and β-cell function and thus, may 
potentially be of use in both type 2 and type 1 diabetes.  
Since glucose and hyperglycemia induce oxidative and inflammato ry stress ( 1,2), it is likely that 
dapagliflozin will reduce oxidative and inflammatory stress. Si nce oxidative and inflammatory 
stresses are the basic mechanis ms underlying atherosclerosis, a  potential anti-oxidative and 
inflammatory action would be an ti-atherogenic. Furthermore, dap agliflozin is also known to 
 Page 7 of 39  IRB Version: JAN2016  reduce blood pressure ( 3,4), the mechanism underlying which is not known. An anti-hyperte nsive 
action is also anti-atherogenic.  Since dapagliflozin is current ly licensed for use in type 2 diabetes 
and since this condition has a markedly increased risk of ather osclerosis and cardiovascular 
disease, it is important that the potential anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory effects of 
dapagliflozin be investigated.  
It is also important that the mechanisms underlying the blood p ressure lowering effect be 
investigated. Our recent work h as shown that blood pressure low ering effect of GLP-1 receptor 
agonists, which was first described by us ( 5), is associated with an increase in plasma 
concentrations of known vasodilators, ANP, cGMP and cAMP; in ad dition, there is a reduction in 
plasma concentrations of angiotensinogen, renin and angiotensin  II. Although the blood pressure 
lowering effect of SGLT-2 inhibitors is attributed to osmotic d iuresis secondary to glucosuria and 
hypovolemia, it is possible that other mechanisms, as enumerate d above, are involved. 
These data will provide us with novel information on the potent ial anti-inflammatory 
effects of dapagliflozin; in addition, they will also provide i nformation on post prandial 
glycemia, insulinogenesis and incretin secretion. Finally, it m ay provide us with 
information on the mechanisms underlying the anti-hypertensive effect of this drug   
It is also important that the mechanisms underlying the blood p ressure lowering effect be

4.0 Study Design 
4.1 Describe and explain the study de sign (e.g. case-control, cross -sectional, 
ethnographic, experimental, inte rventional, longitudinal, obser vational). 
Response: This is a single center, prospective, randomized, placebo –cont rolled, parallel design 
and double blind study. The st udy will be conducted at the Diab etes – Endocrinology Center of 
Western New York under the direction of Dr. Paresh Dandona, M.D . 
Two groups of 26 patients each ( total 52 patients) with type 2 diabetes on oral agents will be 
included in the study. One group will be randomized to dapaglif lozin (a dose of 5 mg daily will 
be titrated to 10 mg daily during the first week) while the oth er will be placebo. The patients will 
be treated for 12 weeks. Randomiz ation will take in considerati on even distribution of patients in 
regards to background medications (statins, ACE inhibitors, TZD s and ARBs). Only half the 
patients (equal numbers in both  groups) will be tested for the secondary endpoints related to 
postprandial and single dose induced changes.   
 
5.0 Local Number of Subjects 
5.1 Indicate the total number of subj ects that will be enrolled or records that will 
be reviewed locally.

5.2 If applicable, indica te how many subjects you e xpect to screen to reach your 
target sample (i.e. your sc reen failure rate).  
Response: 65-75. All screened and qualified patient s will be enrolled and random ized 
up to 52 enrolled patients.  
 Page 9 of 39  IRB Version: JAN2016  5.3 Justify the feasibility of recrui ting the proposed number of el igible subjects 
within the anticipated recruitment period. For example, how man y potential 
subjects do you have access to? Wh at percentage of those potent ial subjects 
do you need to recruit? 
Response: The Diabetes and Endocrinology C enter of WNY is the largest Dia betes 
center in the WNY area, seeing between 60 and 100 type 2 diabet ic patients every month. 
Therefore, majority of recruited patients are our clinic patien ts. We do recruit a few 
patients through advertisement and researchmatch.org . These sources will suffice to 
recruit the needed number to subjects.

6.3 Indicate specifically whether  you will include a ny of the follo wing special 
populations in your study usi ng the checkboxes below.   
 
NOTE:  Members of special populat ions may not be targeted for e nrollment in 
your study unless you indicate this in your inclusion criteria.  
Response:  None of the below  populations will be enrolled 
☐ Adults unable to consent 
☐ Individuals who are not yet adul ts (infants, children, teenage rs) 
☐ Pregnant women 
☐ Prisoners 
6.4 Indicate whether you will include  non-English sp eaking individu als in your 
study.  Provide justification if you will exclude non-English speaking 
individuals.  
In order to meet one of the primar y ethical principles of equit able selection 
of subjects, non-English sp eaking individuals may not be routinely excluded 
from research as a matter of convenience. 
In cases where the research is of  therapeutic intent or is desi gned to 
investigate areas that would n ecessarily require certain popula tions who may 
not speak English, the researcher  is required to make efforts t o recruit and 
include non-English speaking indivi duals.  However, there are s tudies in 
which it would be reasonable to limit subjects to those who spe ak English.  
Some examples include pilot studi es, small unfunded studies wit h validated 
instruments not available in ot her languages, studies with nume rous 
questionnaires, and some non-ther apeutic studies which offer no  direct 
benefit. 
Response: We have no non-English speaking patients in this popu lation.  
We have patients that English i s a second language, but they ar e able to 
read, write and understand it.  Thi s population is less than 10 % of the total 
population.

Non-substantial Modification(s)
Amendment 8 15 June 2023 The driver for B7931028 Protocol Amendment 8
is to modify the key secondary endpoint of ‘time 
to first severe SLE flare’  
 
‘ Time to first severe SLE flare’ will remain 
as a secondary endpoint, just not the ‘key’ secondary endpoint and the data will besummarized as a secondary endpoint.   The estimands for the associated endpoints have been updated to reflect these changes.  E2, has beenupdated to align with the revised ‘Key’ secondary endpoint of ‘BICLA response at Week 52’ as was E7, the estimand for 'time to first severe SLE flare’.  
Section 1.1 Synopsis, the table of Objectives and 
Estimands have been updated to reflect the change of key secondary endpoint to ‘BICLA response at Week 52’. These changes have also been made throughout the OBJECTIVES, ESTIMANDS AND ENDPOINTS table in Section 3.  Language has been added to Section 4.2 to describe the BICLA endpoint and the justification of its use.  Language has been added to Section 9.1.1 Estimands to indicate that details regarding sensitivity analyses of the primary endpoint maybe provided in the SAP. In Section 9.1.2 Hypotheses and Decision Rules, changes have been made throughout to replace time to first severe flare with BICLA response at Week 52 in the statistical hierarchy.  The estimand for BICLA response at Week 52 is now described in Section 9.4.3.1, in place of the estimand which had previously described the analysis of time to first severe flare; the analysis of this endpoint will be performed in a manner which is entirely consistent with the primary analysis of the primary endpoint, SRI-4 response at Week 52.  Subsequently, the 090177e1a05d6b35\A pproved\A pproved On: 22-A pr-2024 15:21 (GMT )CCI

planned analysis for time to first severe flare is 
now described in Section 9.4.3.2.
Rationale: The assumptions about thesevere SLE flare rate in this study population have not been observed and thus the time to first severe flare endpoint would be substantially underpowered.
Section 6.3.1 Allocation of Study Intervention has been updated to remove the following sentence, “Allocation to Study Intervention, In the event of aQuality Assurance audit, the auditor(s) will beallowed access to unblinded study intervention records at the site(s) to verify that randomization/dispensing has been done accurately”.  
Rationale: This sentence was removed because the study was not set-up to allow study sites to have unblinded study intervention records.  Therefore, the auditor would not have the ability to verify the accuracy of randomization and dispensing of study intervention as proposed in this sentence.
Additionally, changes have been made throughout to ensure consistency of the protocol with the SAP.  Typographical changes, and changes for grammar, have been made as they have been identified throughout the protocol and will not be summarized here.
Rationale: Additional clarity regarding planned sensitivity analyses is provided.

future changes to the family-wise error control 
procedure would be detailed in the SAP.
Rationale: This language is used to indicate how any additional changes to the statistical hierarchy will be addressed.
Section 9.2 Sample Size Determination has been updated with power calculations for both the primary endpoint, SRI-4 response at Week 52, and the key secondary endpoint, BICLA response at Week 52 in a manner which is now consistent with the planned primary analyses of these endpoints.  
Rationale: Previously, the power calculations conducted and described in this section incorporated a 25% dropout rate even though these participants are counted as non-responders by the primary estimand.  The calculations are now consistent with the estimand. This section is also updated to reflect the change in the key secondary endpoint.
Amendment 7 06 June 2022 The overall rationale for B7931028 Protocol 
Amendment 7 is to decrease the sample size for the study from 448 participants to 350 participants, and to allow eligibility of participants with latent TB (positive quantiferon gold tests) who agree to receiving treatment with INH and Vitamin B6.This amendment also includes the administrative changes made in Protocol Amendment 5 (requested during the EU Voluntary Harmonization Procedure (VHP) review of Amendment 4, countries submitting their initial clinical trial application with Amendment 5 (Italy and Argentina), and to any country requiring new protocol amendments to be submitted (Taiwan); and Protocol Amendment 6 (China only amendment) to be globally implemented. Furthermore, this change will allow specific safety 090177e1a05d6b35\A pproved\A pproved On: 22-A pr-2024 15:21 (GMT )

monitoring to be put into place to allow 
participants with latent TB (not active TB) to be eligible for the study provided the protocol inclusion/exclusion criteria can be met.  
Section 1.1 Synopsis, Section 3.0 Objectives, 
estimands and ENDPOINTS and Section 9.5 Interim Analysis –The Interim Analysis was updated to now read, “An Interim analysis may be conducted when sufficient number of participants completes Week 52 visits and before the interim analysis is instigated, the details of the objectives, decision criteria, dissemination plan and method of maintaining the study blind per Pfizer’s SOPs will be documented and approved in the E-DMC charter. In addition, the analysis details must be documented and approved in an interim analysis plan (IAP).”
Rationale: Since the sample size was modified from 448 to 350, there are already more than 50% subjects of the subjects that have completed Week 24 therefore, including a ‘sufficient amount of participants’ allows for the participants that meet the interimanalysis requirements to all be included. In addition, the timepoint was updated from Week 24 to Week 52 to provide a more robust dataset.
Section 1.1 Synopsis, Section 9.2 Sample Size Calculation - The Sample size has been modifiedfrom approximately 448 to approximately 350.
Rationale: reduction of sample size to 350 patients provides at least 80% power for the primary endpoint and will allow more timely completion of this study.
Section 1.3, Schedule of Activities, Section 8.2.1.2 Chest X-ray was added to the Week 56 visit, for subjects entering the study with latent TB. If a 090177e1a05d6b35\A pproved\A pproved On: 22-A pr-2024 15:21 (GMT )

subject is diagnosed with latent TB at Week 24 
visit and follows the protocol requirements, a chest X-ray will be conducted at the Week 24 visit. TheSchedule of Activities footnotes were reordered.
Rationale: The Schedule of Activities was updated to collect the specific items required at each visit and to reorder the footnotes in chronological order.
Section 2.2.2, Clinical Overview was updated to align the clinical trial data in this section with the latest version of IB. 
Section 2.2.2, Table 1 -Summary of Clinical 
Studies for Brepocitinib was replaced with Table 14 from the latest version of the PF-06700841 IB to ensure absolute alignment between the 2 documents. 
Section 5.2, Exclusion Criterion #27, Zostavax

was added as an example of a live herpes zoster 
virus vaccination that is prohibited in the study.
Section 5.2, Exclusion Criterion #28, ‘serological’

the previous versions of the protocol.
Section 5.2, Exclusion Criterion #35, If the total bilirubin is ≥1.5 times the ULN, the subject may 
be eligible for the study if they have a history of Gilbert’s syndrome and if their direct bilirubin was <U L N .
Rationale: Participants with known Gilbert’s syndrome have normal liver function despite elevated total bilirubin levels and do not need to be excluded from participation on the basis of the elevated bilirubin level.
Sections 5.1, 5.3.1 and Appendix 10.4.1, Male participants are not required to use barrier contraception to minimize partner exposure to brepocitinib.
Rationale: Based on calculated exposures in semen, Brepocitinib concentrations are predicted to have a safety margin ≥100 in 
male participants, and therefore female partners are not at teratogenicity/fetotoxicity risk. This was updated in the IB (version 7.0, dated November 2021).
Section 6.1.1, Administration, Section 6.4, Study Intervention Compliance and Section 7.1.1, Temporary Discontinuation, the duration of study intervention interruption permitted was updated to14 days.  The updated text reads, “Participants interrupting study intervention for more than 14 days, should be discussed with the sponsor for possible withdrawal from the study.”
Rationale: To allow text alignment of study intervention interruptions. 090177e1a05d6b35\A pproved\A pproved On: 22-A pr-2024 15:21 (GMT )

Section 6.4, Study Intervention Compliance, was 
updated to include the upper bounds of the compliance range (>120%). 
Rationale: Both the upper and lower bounds of the study intervention should be included in the protocol to provide the comprehensive compliance situation. If compliance is outside these limits, Pfizer clinical should be contacted as soon as possible to determine if the participant should discontinue study medication due to non-compliance and if any additional safety assessments are needed.
Section 9.3, Populations for Analysis, the ‘full analysis set’ was updated to read, “All participants randomly assigned to study intervention and received at least one dose of study intervention . 
Participants will be analyzed according to the product they were randomized.” Previously the description was “All participants randomly assigned to study intervention regardless of 
whether they have taken study intervention” . 
Participants will be analyzed according to the product they were randomized.
Rationale: This change was made to accurately define the full analysis set population.
Appendix 10.13, List of Prohibited and Permitted Medications was updated to reflect accurate information on the following medications (updated text is bolded below):

Amendment 6 28 September 
2021Protocol Amendment 6 is only for use in China.  If there is a global amendment in the future for thisstudy, the changes in Amendment 6 will be implemented into the global amendment.
The overall rationale for B7931028 protocol 
amendment 6 is to address the Quantiferon gold 
test results which are not negative.  The 
amendment will allow specific safety monitoring to be put into place to allow participants with latent TB (not active TB) to be eligible for the B7931028 study provided the protocol criteria can be met.  China is having the biggest impact on enrolling participants into the study because of this eligibility criteria; however, once the next global protocol amendment is required, this language will be added as well.
Section 1.1. Synopsis, Overall Design; 
Intervention Groups and Duration Design; Section 1.2, Schema; Schedule of Activities, Footnote ‘g’; Section 4.1 Study Design (twice); Section 5.2, Exclusion Criteria #32; Section 8, Study Assessments and Procedures, Screening - the screening period was increased from 5 weeks or 35-days to 7 weeks or 49 days.  
Rationale: These additional requirements would take additional time; therefore 2 weeks were added to the screening period.  In addition, the following processes around TB testing and diagnosis of latent TB were added 090177e1a05d6b35\A pproved\A pproved On: 22-A pr-2024 15:21 (GMT )

to the protocol.  Subjects diagnosed with 
latent TB were not previous permitted into the study; however, other investigation products with similar mechanisms of action permit subject with latent TB to be entered into their studies, but they also have processes to follow to monitor participant safety.
Section 5.2, Exclusion Criteria #12: The following sentence was added to this exclusion criteria, “Prior Splenectomy is prohibited”.
Rationale: Splenectomy is associated with an increased risk of infection; therefore, it is prohibited from this study. 
Section 5.2, Exclusion Criteria #32 and Section 8.2.6,  Tuberculosis (TB) Screening and Monitoring: Latent TB – Requirements for a prospective participant to be eligible for the study if the subject is diagnosed with latent TB (ie, visit to the infectious disease/pulmonary specialist for further investigation and agreement the participant can enroll into the study, only medication to treat latent TB permitted in the study is INH and Vitamin B6 therapy) was added to the protocol as it was not permitted in previous protocol versions.
The main additions to Monitoring of TB on-study:
!Week 24, if participant tests TB positive or TB 
indeterminant, they must discontinue study medication immediately, be seen the pulmonary/infectious disease specialist, once active TB is ruled out, then if the subject start INH and B6 latent TB treatment, they must be on that treatment at least 2-weeks prior to re-starting study medication.

the study. 
Rationale: To allow prospective participants in the study to have the possibility of being eligible for the study (by having IGRA retest done, and the other protocol requirements completed by Day 1); whereas this was not permitted in the previous versions of the protocol.
 
 
 
  
 
 
Section 5.2, Exclusion Criteria #24 and Appendix 13, Prohibited and Permitted Medications: The following exclusion criteria was added to ensure subjects on any of the bonemarrow stimulants to improve cell counts is discontinued 12 weeks prior to Screening/Day 1.  
Rationale: In this study, a prospective participant was taking this medication.  The team felt this was not an appropriate medication to be taken while participating in an investigational study due to unknown potential safety concerns.  This exclusion criteria was added to avoid this situation in the future.
Section 2.3 Benefit/Risk Assessments and Appendix 13 Permitted and Prohibited Concomitant Medications-In Section 2.3, the phrase ‘inhibitors or’ was removed.

the March 2020 Type C meeting.  In the March 
2020 Type C meeting, the FDA suggested to Pfizer statistical considerations for the protocol that have been implemented and the FDA suggested to Pfizer to consider anchoring the Facit-fatigue data changes in the study that were statistically significant in comparison to what the patient felt was clinically significant. 
!Section 1.1. Synopsis, Objectives and

Analysis of the Primary Endpoint – Revised 
the primary analysis from a logistic regression model to the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) approach.  Both approaches should produce similar results, but the former approach may be subject to convergence issue in some occasions.
Updated all estimands with the five attributes

there have been thromboembolic events reported in ongoing blinded clinical studies, where relationship to treatment is uncertain.  Suspected thromboembolic events will be subject to review by an external blinded adjudication committee.  In this study, B7931028, participants with any history of pulmonary embolisms (unless these were caused by known antiphospholipid syndrome will be excluded from the protocol unless the participant has been adequately anticoagulated), exclusion criteria #5 and #6 have more detailed information”. 
The following modifications from the 21Jan2020 PACL were incorporated into PA4:

Rationale: The current text states #18 and 
represents a carry-over from Amendment 2.  In Amendment 3, 1 exclusion criteria (#7) was split in to 2 separate criteria, which should have been addressed in Exclusion Criteria #20 by renumbering exclusion criteria #18 to exclusion criteria #19.  This error in the criteria numbering has been corrected.
!Section 5.2 Exclusion Criteria #31 – will 
now state: 
Chest radiograph taken at screening with 
changes suggestive of active TB infection, or previous inactive TB, general infections, heart failure or malignancy unless previously 
performed and documented within 12 weeks

Rationale: The addition of the new text will 
make exclusion criterion #31 consistent with Section 8.2.2.1 Chest X-Ray. 
!Section 8.2.3 Vital Signs – will now state: 
Participants should refrain from smoking (or use any tobacco products) or ingesting caffeine during the 30 minutes prior to the measurements.
Rationale: Per Amendment 3, Section 5.2

!For consistency purposes, participants who are screen failures may be rescreened one time in the study, the re-screening visit must occur at least ≥2 weeks (previously, 
the time between screen failure determination and re-screening was ≥ 1 
month).  The re-screen time period of 2 weeks or once month was inconsistent in the protocol and the study team felt that re-screening within at least 2 weeks was ample time for re-screening.

Page 601. PROTOCOL SUMMARY 
1.1. SynopsisRationale:
This is the first study of PF-06700841(brepocitinib) in participants with moderate to severe 
active, generalized Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) that have inadequate response to standard of care.  The purpose of the study is to determine the safety and efficacy of PF-06700841 in SLE.  The patient population selected for this study is participants who have active SLE (excluding active central nervous system [CNS] lupus or renal lupus with proteinuria (UPCr >3.0 mg/mg) and/or estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] <50 mL/min/1.73 m
2) that usually require an increased level of immunosuppression.  Such 
participants with SLE are currently being managed with multiple medications, including antimalarial drugs, immunosuppressives and corticosteroids.  All these medications will be allowed as standard of care background treatment during the study.  As study intervention will be adjunct therapy to participant’s standard of care, no participants will receive placebo alone.

Overall Design:
This is a Phase 2b, double-blind, randomized, placebo controlled, parallel design, 
multicenter, dose ranging study to assess the efficacy and safety of PF-06700841 in participants with active, moderate to severe generalized SLE.  After an up to a 7-week screening period, eligible participants will be randomized in a 1:2:2:2 ratio such that participants will receive either 1 of three PF-06700841 once a day (QD) dose levels (15 mg, 30 mg and 45 mg) or placebo every day for 52 weeks.  
Number of ParticipantsApproximately 350 randomized participants (100 participants per treatment group except 
50 participants for the PF-06700841 15 mg QD dose group) will participate in this study at approximately 185 investigative sites worldwide.  Randomization will be stratified by screening disease severity and anti-dsDNA status.  The purpose of the stratified randomization is to achieve balanced treatment groups in these stratification factors.090177e1a05d6b35\A pproved\A pproved On: 22-A pr-2024 15:21 (GMT )

Page 63Intervention Groups and Duration
For this study, the study intervention is PF-06700841.  Blinded PF-06700841 and its matched 
placebo will be provided as tablets for oral administration.  Participants will participate in this study for approximately 63 weeks.  This includes up to a 7-week screening period, the 52-week treatment period, and the 4-week follow-up period. 
Data Monitoring CommitteeThis study will use an independent external data monitoring committee (E-DMC).  The 
E-DMC will be responsible for ongoing monitoring of the safety of participants in the study.This E-DMC will make recommendations with regard to continuing, stopping or altering the trial to a Sponsor Management Committee throughout the study. If an interim analysis is performed, the interim analysis results will also be provided to the E-DMC for review.
Adjudication CommitteesThis study will also use separate blinded adjudication committees consisting of independent 
external experts who will be responsible for the ongoing review of the following ef ficacy and 
safety endpoints:
1. BILAG, SLEDAI-2K and associated data.  
2. Severe Flare.3. Cardiovascular and thromboembolic events.4. Malignancy.5. Opportunistic infections.
Statistical Methods:The primary estimand for the primary endpoint of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Responder 
Index (SRI-4) response at Week 52 will be the population average treatment difference between PF-06700841 and placebo in the proportion of participants with active SLE who achieved SRI-4 endpoint at Week 52 and did not discontinue study intervention before Week 52. SRI-4 response is a composite endpoint where a responder must meet criteria in the assessment of SLEDAI-2K, BILAG and PhGA. Data post intercurrent events will be censored and any participant who experienced these intercurrent events will be considered as a non-responder at Week 52.  The population-level summary will be the differences in the proportions of SRI-4 responder at Week 52 between each treatment dose arm of 
PF-06700841 and the placebo arm. For the primary endpoint, a treatment policy estimand 
will also be included in the SAP as a secondary estimand to estimate the treatment difference in the SRI-4 response rate at Week 52 regardless of occurrence of any intercurrent events prior to Week 52.090177e1a05d6b35\A pproved\A pproved On: 22-A pr-2024 15:21 (GMT )

Page 64Each of the three dose groups of PF-06700841 will be compared with the placebo group for 
both the primary endpoint of SRI-4 response at Week 52 and the key secondary endpoint of BICLA response at Week 52 in 6 hypotheses.  In order to control the overall family-wise type-I error rate, a sequentially rejective closed testing procedure is defined.
The primary endpoint is the proportion of SRI-4 responders at Week 52 and the primary 
analysis of this endpoint will be based on the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) approach adjusting for stratification factors.  The hypothesis testing of this endpoint will be based on the p-values for pairwise treatment comparisons between each dose group of PF-06700841 and the placebo group. Treatment difference in the proportion of responders for the active treatment compared to the placebo will be estimated based on the CMH approach. These estimates will be reported with 95% confidence intervals and one-sided p-values.
The key secondary endpoint is the proportion of BICLA responders at Week 52 and the 
primary analysis of this endpoint will be conducted in the manner described above for the primary endpoint using the CMH approach adjusting for stratification factors.  The hypothesis testing of this endpoint will be based on the p-values for pairwise treatment comparisons between each dose group of PF-06700841 and the placebo group.  Treatment difference in the proportion of responders for the active treatment compared to the placebo will be estimated based on the CMH approach.  These estimates will be reported with 95% confidence intervals and one-sided p-values.
An Interim analysis may be conducted when sufficient number of participants completes 
Week 52 visits and before the interim analysis is instigated, the details of the objectives, decision criteria, dissemination plan and method of maintaining the study blind per Pfizer’s SOPs will be documented and approved in the E-DMC charter.  In addition, the analysis details must be documented and approved in an interim analysis plan (IAP).
Further details of analyses in safety and efficacy will be specified in the statistical analysis 
plan. 090177e1a05d6b35\A pproved\A pproved On: 22-A pr-2024 15:21 (GMT )

Page 742. INTRODUCTION
PF-06700841(brepocitinib) is a potent tyrosine kinase (TYK)2/Janus kinase (JAK)1 inhibitor 
that is highly selective over the other human kinases and is being developed for the treatment of participants with active Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE).
PF-06700841 is an orally bioavailable small molecule with a good selectivity profile over the 
other human kinases including JAK2 and JAK3.  PF-06700841 inhibited the in vitroactivities of TYK2, JAK1, JAK2 and JAK3 with IC50 values of 22.7, 16.8 nM, 76.6 nM and 6490 nM, respectively.  PF-06700841 is capable of inhibiting the cytokines with signaling pathways mediated by JAK1 and/or TYK2, incl uding type I IFNs, IL-6, IL-12, IL-15, IL-21, 
IL-22, IL-23, and IFN ∃.  Many of these cytokines are involved in the pathogenesis of SLE. 
The inhibition of TYK2 and JAK1 will lead to modulation of multiple cytokines which play 
a critical role in the pathogenesis of SLE, including Type 1 interferons (IFN %,∀; 
JAK1/TYK2 dependent), IFN ∃(JAK1/JAK2 dependent), IL-6 (JAK1/JAK2/TYK2 
dependent), and IL-21(JAK1/JAK3 dependent).  In addition, IL-6 and IL-21 play a critical 
role in the development of Th17 cells and production of their signature cytokine IL-17, which has a critical role in a variety of autoimmune diseases including SLE.
1  Thus, key 
signaling molecules TYK2 and JAK1 are attractive therapeutic targets for diseases associated with widely dysregulated immune functions, such as SLE.
2.1. Study Rationale 
This is the first study of PF-06700841 in participants with active, generalized SLE that have 
inadequate response to standard of care.  The purpose of the study is to determine the safety and efficacy of PF-06700841 in SLE.  The patient population selected for this study is participants who have active SLE (excluding active central nervous system [CNS] lupus or renal lupus with proteinuria (UPCr >3.0 mg/mg) and/or estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] <50 mL/min/1.73 m
2) that usually require an increased level of immunosuppression.  
Such participants with SLE are currently being managed with multiple medications, including anti-malarial drugs, immunosuppressives and corticosteroids.  All these medications will be allowed as standard of care background treatment during the study.  As study intervention will be adjunct therapy to participant’s standard of care, no participants will receive placebo alone.
2.2. Background
Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic inflammatory disease of unknown 
etiology, which can affect the skin, joints, kidneys, lungs, nervous system, serous membranes and/or other organs of the body.  Immunologic abnormalities, especially the production of 
 are a prominent feature of the disease.
2  The clinical course of 
SLE is variable and characterized by periods of remissions and relapses.  Women, especially in their childbearing years, are affected more frequently than men.
3  SLE is more prevalent in 
certain racial and ethnic groups such as blacks (of African descent), Asians, and Hispanics.4  
The prevalence of lupus ranges from approximately 40 cases per 100,000 persons among Northern Europeans to more than 200 per 100,000 persons among blacks.

Page 75quality of care and survival of SLE patients have improved in the past two decades, further 
improvement depends on the availability of more effective and safer treatment modalities. 
The treatment of SLE can be individualized and depends on symptom manifestations, organ 
involvement, and disease severity.6,7  Antimalarials, low dose corticosteroids, and 
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are used in the treatment of mild symptoms such as arthralgias and cutaneous manifestations.  High dose corticosteroids and cytotoxic agents are used in more severe disease.  Immunosuppressive agents such as cyclophosphamide, tacrolimus and rituximab are used depending on the severity and various organ systems involved.  Development of novel therapies for SLE has been relatively slow partly because of the variability of the disease and partly because the disease is often responsive to corticosteroids and conventional immunosuppressive agents. 
Prior to 2011, only 3 drugs were approved by the United States Food and Drug 
Administration (US FDA) for the treatment of S LE:  corticosteroi ds, hydroxychloroquine 
(Plaquenil) and low-dose aspirin.  These therapies are not ideal in terms of efficacy and toxicities.  In March 2011, the US FDA approved belimumab (Benlysta) for treatment of SLE, and several months later in July 2011, the European Commission granted marketing authorisation for Benlysta valid throughout the European Union.
8,9  However, the magnitude 
of the clinical benefit of belimumab seems modest and the drug is indicated for treatment of patients with active SLE as a combination therapy with conventional modalities.  Management of refractory lupus manifestations, minimization of treatment-related complications and prevention of disease flares and cumulative damage remain unsatisfactory.  Therefore, there is an unmet need for the development of safer and more effective therapies that can induce a long-lasting remission in SLE. 
SLE is characterized by broad dysregulation of the immune system that involves T and 
B cells, dendritic cells, and macrophages.  The hallmark of the disease is the production of 
 and the formation of immune complexes causing organ damage by 
deposition in the tissues.  Pro-inflammatory cytokines play an important and diverse role in the pathogenesis of SLE, and their imbalance determines disease activity and severity.
Many key cytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of SLE are dependent on activation of 
Janus kinases (JAKs) for intracellular signaling.
10The JAK family of cytoplasmic protein 
tyrosine kinases mediates the signalling of several pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as type I (JAK1/TYK2) and type II (JAK1/JAK2) interferons, IL-6 (JAK1/JAK2/TYK2), and IL-12 and IL-23 (JAK2/TYK2). PF-06700841 is an orally administered selective and reversible inhibitor of JAK1 and TYK2.

2.2.1. Nonclinical overview
No adverse findings were observed in oral repeat-dose toxicity studies with PF-06700841 in 
rats and monkeys up to 6 and 9 months in duration, respectively.  PF-06700841-related, non-adverse, target organs identified include the immune and hematolymphopoietic systems (thymus, spleen, lymph nodes, and bone marrow), cardiovascular system (blood pressure, 
heart rate, corrected QT wave interval [QTc]), gastrointestinal tract (body weight and weight gain effects), and adrenal gland (vacuolation).  The findings in the thymus, spleen, lymph 090177e1a05d6b35\A pproved\A pproved On: 22-A pr-2024 15:21 (GMT )

Page 76nodes, and bone marrow are consistent with the pharmacological activity of PF-06700841.  
The no observed adverse effect level (NOAELs) in the 6-and 9-month toxicity studies were 45 mg/kg/day in rats (unbound maximum concentration (C
max) of 8280 ng/mL and area under 
the curve at 24 hours (AUC 24) of 69,700 ng•h/mL) and 20 mg/kg/day in monkeys (unbound 
Cmaxof 2260 ng/mL and AUC 24of 10,700 ng•h/mL).  Adverse findings in the central nervous 
system (decreased activity, mortality, prostration, convulsions) were observed at high systemic exposures in pregnant, but not in non-pregnant rabbits. 
In oral embryo-fetal development studies in rats and rabbits, adverse PF-06700841-related 
developmental effects occurred (lower embryo-fetal viability and mean fetal body weights, fetal skeletal malformations, external malformations).  The developmental NOAEL in rabbits was 1 mg/kg/day (unbound C
maxof 174 ng/mL and AUC 24of 608 ng•h/mL). 
The developmental NOAEL in rats was not established and is <2 mg/kg/day (unbound C max
of 482 ng/mL and AUC 24of 2240 ng•h/mL), the lowest dose tested.  No effects on female 
reproductive organs, as assessed by histopathologic examination, were noted in either the rat or monkey repeat-dose toxicity studies.  PF -06700841 is not mutagenic in bacterial reverse 
mutation assays.  Although PF-06700841 was positive for micronuclei formation in vitro (through an aneugenic mechanism), it did not induce micronuclei in vivo in rats at 
55 mg/kg/day (unbound C
max= 7730 ng/mL and AUC 24= 88,300 ng•h/mL), the highest dose 
tested in the 1-month oral toxicity study. 
Further details of the nonclinical safety program are provided in the current PF-06700841 
Investigator’s Brochure.

Page 872.2.2.1. Safety Overview
Overall, PF-06700841 was generally safe and well tolerated in all clinical trials to date.  
There were no clinically meaningful findings in vital signs, electrocardiograms (ECG), suicidal behavior or ideation, or potential Hy’s Law cases reported during these studies. 
Refer to the current Investigator’s Brochure (IB) for more details on the clinical safety 
information with PF-06700841.
2.2.2.1.1. Phase 1 Studies (B7931001 and B7931009)
The most commonly reported all causality treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) 
across active healthy participants were serum creatinine increased (reported in 2 participants during the SAD period and 11 participants during the MAD period) without any changes in Cystatin C measured renal function.  Neutropenia was reported in four participants during the MAD period, most of them were mild in severity except one with moderate, and none of them reached <500/mm
3during the study.  The most frequently observed laboratory 
abnormalities in healthy participants were elevated low density lipoprotein (LDL) and serum creatinine.  There were no deaths or serious adverse events (SAEs) reported in the Phase 1 studies.  One psoriasis participant receiving 100 mg QD of Study intervention (IP) in B7931001 experienced an adverse event of herpes zoster during the follow up period, after completing 28-day treatment. 
2.2.2.1.2. Phase 2 Studies (B7931004 and B7931005)
A total of 189 psoriasis participants out of 212 enrolled in B7931004 were exposed to at least 
1 dose of PF-06700841 during the study.  The proportion of participants with all-causality TEAEs was comparable across all treatment arms but numerically higher in the active treatment arms (64.0% to 76.7%) than the placebo group (56.5%).  The majority of participants in all treatment arms experienced mild or moderate all-causality TEAEs, and only 5.2% experienced severe all-causality TEAEs. 
Overall, there were no dose dependent increases in the all-causality TEAEs.  Most TEAEs in 
the Infection and Infestation class were mild to moderate except one participant who had two serious infections after taking a single dose of 60 mg PF-06700841 on Day 1.  One participant in the 30 mg QD to 100 mg once a week (QW) group had squamous cell carcinoma of skin reported on Day 2 of treatment.  One participant in the 30 to 10 mg group 
was confirmed to be pregnant after in the study 42 days and discontinued from the study with 
obstetrical ultrasound demonstrating fetal cleft lip.
Decreased reticulocytes, hemoglobin, and neutrophils were observed in the participants on 
active treatment during 4-week induction phase and returned toward baseline level during 8-week maintenance phase.  Increases in serum creatinine from baseline were observed in all active treatment arms with no association of change in cystatin C based renal function measurement.  Other commonly reported laboratory abnormalities were elevation of low density lipid (LDL) with no clinical meaningful changes in LDL/HDL ratio.  There were no clinically meaningful changes from baseline observed in creatine kinase (CK) during the study.  CK levels >10 × upper limit of normal (ULN) were observed in two participants 090177e1a05d6b35\A pproved\A pproved On: 22-A pr-2024 15:21 (GMT )

Page 88without adverse event.  One moderate adverse event (AE) of CK-myoglobin increase was 
reported by one participant in the 30 to 10 mg QD group during the induction period, which was considered to be related to the IP by the investigator.  No participant was discontinued from the study due to CK elevation.
In the study B7931005, 47 alopecia areata participants were exposed to at least one dose of 
PF-06700841.  The most commonly reported TEAEs in the active treatment arm was in the Infections and Infestations system organ class (SOC) (51.1% in the IP vs 40.4% in the placebo).  Other TEAEs were Gastrointestinal Disorders (23.4% in the IP vs 25.5% in the placebo).  Most of those TEAEs were mild.  There were two participants receiving PF-06700841 that experienced rhabdomyolysis after strenuously exercising during the study, which were not considered to be related to the IP by investigator assessment.  Three participants experienced mild decreases in neutrophils, one participant had a mild reduction in platelets, and one participant a mild reduction in lymphocytes.
Please refer to the Investigator’s Brochure for safety and efficacy findings in other 
brepocitinib Phase 1 and 2 studies.
2.2.2.2. Summary of PF-06700841 Pharmacokinetics in human
In Study B7931001, following single oral doses of 1 mg to 200 mg under fasted conditions, 
PF-06700841 was absorbed rapidly with median time to maximum (T
max) of 1 hour or less.  
Mean terminal half-life (t ½) ranged from 3.8 to 7.5 hours.  In general, both the area under the 
plasma concentration time curve from time 0 extrapolated to infinity (AUC inf) and maximum 
plasma concentration (C max) appeared to increase proportionally with dose from 1 mg to 
100 mg.  Increases from 100 mg to 200 mg appear more than dose proportional, especially for AUC
inf.
On Day 10 of multiple dose administration, PF-06700841 was absorbed rapidly with median T
maxof 1 to 1.5 hours or less across the entire range of doses, from a total daily dose of 
10 mg up to 175 mg.  Following attainment of C max, the disposition of PF-06700841 was 
similar with that observed following single dose administration.  Mean terminal half-life (t ½) 
ranged from 4.9 to 10.7 hours.  Both area under the concentration time curve from time 0 to 
time&(AUC t) and C maxgenerally appeared to increase proportionally with dose from 10 mg 
to 100 mg QD, with a trend towards greater than proportional increase from 100 mg to 
175 mg QD.  Accumulations, following once daily dosing, ranged from 1.1 to 1.4 for AUC t
and 0.8 to 1.1 for C max.  The urinary recovery of unchanged (Ae &%) PF-06700841 on Day 10 
across all doses ranged from 8.9% to 15.5%.  Following multiple dose administration of PF-06700841 to participants with psoriasis for 28 days, the overall exposure observed was comparable to that in healthy participants at same dose level.

Page 892.2.2.3. Assessment of PF-06700841 Effect on QT 
A formal QT study (B7931019) was recently completed.  As the clinical study report (CSR) 
preparation is in progress, the results are considered draft and potentially subject to change. 
Following a single dose of 200 mg PF-06700841, the maximum placebo-corrected QTcF 
change from baseline was observed at 3 hours post-dose with mean of 14.6 ms and 90% confidence interval (CI) of (12.4, 16.8 ms).  Despite QTc increase seen, no clinically significant findings in ECG including QTc change from baseline >60 msec and QTc absolute value >500 msec were observed.  As pre-defined in the protocol, concentration-QTcF (CQT) analysis was used to determine PF-06700841 effects on QT prolongation at relevant clinical exposures.  The results from the CQT analysis suggested that the relationship between PF-06700841 concentration and QTcF change from baseline was most adequately described by an E
maxmodel, in which the maximum QTcF change (E max) was estimated to be 15.7 ms 
(90% CI: 13.2, 18.2 ms).  The QTcF increase observed at a dose of 200 mg PF-06700841 appeared to reach maximum effect.  Based on the model prediction, the mean change in QTcF at steady-state C
maxof a 45 mg QD dose was 7.7 ms (90% CI: 6.5, 9.1 ms), which 
suggested that no positive QT effect is expected at PF-06700841 therapeutic doses up to 45 mg QD as the upper bound of two-sided 90% CI is <10 ms.
36  At PF-06700841 60 mg 
QD, the highest clinical dose being tested in Phase 2 studies, the mean QTcF increase at C max
was expected to be 8.8 ms (90%CI: 7.7, 10.2 ms) with the upper bound of 90% CI slightly exceeding 10 ms.  
Refer to the current Investigator’s Brochure (IB) for more details on the QT study design and 
results.
2.3. Benefit/Risk Assessment
PF-06700841, a TYK2/JAK1 inhibitor, is expected to offer therapeutic benefit in the 
treatment of SLE.  Indeed, compared with other JAK inhibitors, inhibition of IL-12 and IL-23 signaling mediated by TYK2 inhibitory activity may provide a new and improved therapeutic benefit.  Study participants could benefit from the potential achievement of disease control, improvement of signs and symptoms, as well as improvements in quality of life.
Based on the current clinical and nonclinical experience with brepocitinib and other 
information from other approved oral JAK inhibitors (eg, Xeljanz
®(tofacitinib), Jakafi®
(ruxolitinib), Olumiant®(baricitinib), and Rinvoq®(upadacitinib), the potential risks for 
brepocitinib include: (1) viral reactivation; (2) serious infection and opportunistic infections; 
(3) malignancy and lymphoproliferative disorders; (4) hematological abnormalities and other alterations in laboratory parameters: decreased neutrophil counts, change in lymphocyte counts, decreased hemoglobin level, decreased platelet counts, and elevation of hepatic transaminases; (5) alterations in the lipid profile; (6) increases in serum creatinine; (7) increases in creatine phosphokinase; (8) QT prolongation, (9) bone changes for oral route of administration in the administration in the <12 years of age group; (10) vaccinations: and (11) thromboembolism.090177e1a05d6b35\A pproved\A pproved On: 22-A pr-2024 15:21 (GMT )

Page 90In the brepocitinib development program, there have been thromboembolic events reported in 
ongoing blinded clinical studies, where relationship to treatment is uncertain. Suspected thromboembolic events will be subject to review by an external blinded adjudication committee. In this study, B7931028, participants with any history of a pulmonary embolisms (unless these were caused by known antiphospholipid syndrome will be excluded from the protocol unless the participant has been adequately anticoagulated), exclusion criteria # 5and 
#6have more detailed information. 
Based on in vitro data, and the clinical DDI study of brepocitinib with itraconazole, moderate and strong cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A) inducers, strong P-glycoprotein (P-gp) inhibitors, P-gp substrates and substrates of OCT2/MATE with a narrow therapeutic index, will be prohibited during oral PF-06700841 treatment periods in ongoing Phase 2 studies to minimize any potential significant drug interaction.  Detailed information about in vitro assessments on drug metabolism, enzyme phenotype and drug-drug interaction can be found in the investigator’s brochure.
In conclusion, the sponsor considers that the available information from the nonclinical and 
clinical studies completed to date with PF-06700841 provide a favorable benefit-risk profile and support its continued investigation as a potential treatment for SLE.  
More detailed information about the known and expected benefits and risks and reasonably 
expected adverse events (AEs) of PF-06700841 may be found in the current IB, which is the single reference safety document (SRSD) for this study.

4. STUDY DESIGN
4.1. Overall DesignThis is a Phase 2b, double-blind, randomized, placebo controlled, parallel design, 
multicenter, dose-ranging study to assess the efficacy and safety of PF-06700841 in participants with active, moderate to severe generalized SLE.  After a 7-week screening period, eligible participants will be randomly assigned to one of the four treatment groups (A-D in Table 2) in a 1:2:2:2 ratio such that participants will receive either 1 of three PF-06700841 QD dose levels (15 mg, 30 mg and 45 mg) or placebo every day for 52 weeks. All participants who are randomized should be encouraged to remain in the study to at least the end of the double-blind period to complete safety and efficacy assessments in order to reduce missing data as much as possible.  It is expected that the only reasons for which a participant will withdraw from the study will be for withdrawal of consent or lost to follow-up.
Approximately 350 randomized participants (100 participants per treatment group except 
50 participants for the PF-06700841 15 mg QD dose group) will participate in this study at approximately 185 investigative sites worldwide.  Randomization will be stratified by screening disease severity (SLEDAI-2K total adjudicated score) and anti-dsDNA status.  The purpose of the stratified randomization is to achieve balanced treatment groups in these stratification factors.

Treatment Group Treatment Group Description Participant Size
A PF-06700841 15 mg QD 50
B PF-06700841 30 mg QD 100
C PF-06700841 45 mg QD 100
D Placebo 100
For this study, the study intervention is PF-06700841.  Blinded PF-06700841 and its matched placebo will be provided as tablets for oral administration.  Participants will participate in this study for approximately up to 63 weeks.  This includes up to a 7-week screening period, a 52-week treatment period, and a 4-week follow-up period. 
4.2. Scientific Rationale for Study Design
The primary endpoint of the study is the proportion of participants achieving Systemic Lupus 
Erythematosus Responder Index (SRI)-4 at Week 52.  The SRI is a disease activity index developed for use in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) clinical trials in collaboration with the FDA.  It detects both improvement and worsening in the same and different organ systems, and it was validated in a long term clinical trial and is compatible with regulatory guidance from both the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and FDA.  The SRI is a composite score utilizing the SLEDAI to assess improvement, the BILAG to assess 090177e1a05d6b35\A pproved\A pproved On: 22-A pr-2024 15:21 (GMT )

Page 100significant worsening or flares, and the physician global assessment (PhGA) to assess 
whether or not there has been any significant deterioration in the participant’s overall condition.  The 4-point improvement in the SRI has been shown to be a clinically meaningful change in large, randomized control studies.
12  Therefore, the SRI-4 was chosen for the 
primary efficacy assessment in this study.  Based on published data 52 weeks of treatment is appropriate to establish efficacy of a new compound in SLE. 
The key secondary endpoint of the study is the proportion of participants achieving BICLA 
response at Week 52.  BICLA is a composite endpoint requiring  that the following criteria are met: improvement in the BILAG-2004 score (improvement in all BILAG-2004 grade A scores at study entry to grades B, C, or D at follow-up; improvement in all BILAG-2004 grade B scores at study entry to grades C or D at follow-up); no worsening in the BILAG-2004 score (no new BILAG-2004 grade A scores; no more than 1 new BILAG-2004 grade B score); no increase compared to baseline in the SLEDAI-2K total score; no worsening compared to baseline (10-mm increase on a 100-mm visual analog scale) in the physician’s global assessment of disease activity; and no disallowed prohibited changes in concomitant medications (corticosteroids, immunomodulators or antimalarials). BICLA was developed as an alternative method to the SRI-4 of detecting clinical activity in SLE and has been used to support the approval of anifrolumab as well as being used in other SLE investigational programs.
13Compared to the SRI-4 which demonstrated improvement in disease activity as 
an absence of activity in an organ system, BICLA requires a decrease in disease activity in an affected organ system but also requires that all organ systems that are affected have demonstrated improvement. Additionally SRI considers  disease activity to be reduced based on normalization of serological markers ( ) while BICLA ( 
based on BILAG scoring) does not consider reduction in serologic markers as evidence of improvement. 
In prior versions of this protocol, time to severe flare had been proposed as a major 
secondary endpoint, however Pfizer considers that it is scientifically justified to change the key secondary endpoint to BICLA in this study for 3 reasons. First, in prior versions of this protocol, the incidence of severe flare in a moderate to severe lupus population was considered to be 25% per year. This flare rate is an overestimation of what has been seen in 
multiple SLE studies conducted in patients with moderate to severe disease, where the severe 
flare rate generally approximates 5-10% annually. Based on this information, the major secondary endpoint of severe flare was estimated to be underpowered. Second, although there is fairly good concordance between SRI and BICLA, there is occasionally a difference in the reduction in disease activity assessed by these methods within the same study, as illustrated by the discrepancy observed in the 2 anifrolumab phase 2 studies. Elevating BICLA to a secondary endpoint recognizes the importance of looking for consistency between both outcome measures in the current trial. Finally, BICLA response, similar to SRI response, has been shown to correlated with general improvement in patient physical and mental health, demonstrating that BICLA response is clinically meaningful to both patients and health care providers.

Page 101ensure that participants who have a higher risk of developing renal disease or who are 
actively flaring at the time of study entry are evenly distributed cross treatment arms. 
Adjudicated screening SLEDAI-2K scores differentiate participants by disease activity at the 
time of study entry.  In some studies, participants with higher disease activity at study entry were more likely to demonstrate a benefit from a study intervention and more likely to have adverse events than participants with lower baseline disease activity.  Stratification by adjudicated screening SLEDAI scores is to limit the possible confounding effects of disease activity on efficacy and safety outcomes. 
It is desirable to have participants treated with corticosteroids (CS) on a dose as low as 
possible to minimize side effects/long term damage associated with administration of CS.  A low dose of CS has been associated with a lower risk of sustaining long-term damage, hence the specification that participants should be tapered to a dose ≤7.5 mg/day of prednisone (or 
equivalent).
Approximately 350 participants will be enrolled in the study with 100 participants per 
treatment group with the exception of the PF-06700841 15 mg QD dose group, which will enroll approximately 50 participants.  Based on evidence from other studies, the 15 mg dose does not inhibit inflammatory cytokine effects to the same extent as the proposed 30 mg and 45 mg doses and is likely to be a subtherapeutic dose.  Because SLE is a severe debilitating disease and participants with unabated disease activity may accrue end-organ damage over time, it is decided to reduce the number of participants for the 15 mg QD dose arm. 
It is estimated that 5 to 10% of study participants may be taking concomitant mycophenolate 
mofetil (MMF) at study entry.  Target trough levels for therapeutic effect and levels at which risk of adverse effects of MMF are more likely to occur have been characterized and therapeutic drug monitoring to ascertain exposures within the defined target ranges can be obtained easily at central laboratories.
13  Glucuronidation is the primary metabolic pathway 
for MMF.  Corticosteroids are potent inducers of the glucuronidation pathway.  Therefore, as participants taper corticosteroids, the rate of MMF metabolism may decrease and MMF levels may rise by as much as 30-35%.
16  Since participants in this study are required to taper 
corticosteroids (when appropriate), measurement of the active metabolite of MMF, mycophenolic acid (MPA), prior to and following corticosteroid tapering will be evaluated in this study. 
Trough levels of MMF will be measured at Day 1 and Week 40 at the central laboratory.  
The participant should refrain from taking their MMF dose immediately prior to these clinic visits and record the time of their last MMF dose.  Should participants develop adverse events suggestive of high MMF levels (decreases in cellular blood counts, serious infections) additional safety monitoring of MPA levels may be requested.

4.3. Justification for Doses
This Phase 2b, dose-ranging study will assess three PF-06700841 doses (15 mg, 30 mg and 
45 mg) administered once a day (QD) for 52 weeks in comparison to placebo. 
Doses selected for this Phase 2 study are based on the safety and efficacy observed to date 
with PF-06700841 in healthy participants (B7931001) and participants with active psoriasis (B7931001 and B7931004) and alopecia areata (B7931005).  The overall safety profile to date with PF-06700841 has been acceptable with doses up to 60 mg QD for 4 weeks and 30 mg QD for up to 20 weeks in completed studies.  Ongoing studies in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are assessing the 60 mg QD dose for up to 12 weeks, and an extended period at 30 mg QD for up to 52 weeks.  The highest dose level selected for this study is 45 mg QD, lower than the top dose of 60 mg in the ongoing Phase 2 studies in IBD to reduce any potential safety risk, particularly associated with a population of SLE participants compared to the other populations currently being assessed in Phase 2.  SLE participants are known to have a greater overall risk for severe infections due to underlying immune defects as well as to the common use of immunosuppressants, including corticosteroids.
Based on the preliminary population PK analysis with combined data from studies B7931001 
in healthy participants and B7931004 in participants with moderate to severe psoriasis, the expected median steady state exposures (AUC
24) following 15, 30 and 45 mg QD are 677, 
1360 and 2030 ng.h/mL, respectively in a patient population.  As a result, the exposure of PF-06700841 (AUC
24) at 45 mg QD in this study are expected to be 56x and 8.6x below the 
AUC 24at the no observed adverse effect levels (NOAELs) observed in the 6-month rat (45 
mg/kg/day) and 9-month monkey (20 mg/kg/day) studies, respectively.  The pharmacological 
activity of PF-06700841 was assessed by reduction of high sensitivity C-reactive protein 
(hsCRP) in participants with moderate to severe psoriasis (B7931004).  In study B7931004, the median reduction (percent change from baseline) of hsCRP observed at week 4 were approximately 61% and 76% with PF-06700841 30 and 60 mg QD treatment, respectively.  Study B7931004 also showed that PF-06700841 reached maximal effect on hsCRP within approximately 2 weeks after start of treatment and remained constant throughout the 12-week treatment period.  Previous studies suggested that the baseline levels of hsCRP in participants with moderate to severe psoriasis and active SLE were comparable (median of ~2.9 mg/dL in both participant populations).  As a result, the median hsCRP reduction with PF-06700841 45 mg daily dose up to 52 weeks would expect to be between 61% to 76% in participants with active SLE in the current study. 090177e1a05d6b35\A pproved\A pproved On: 22-A pr-2024 15:21 (GMT )CCI

present on the joint assessment, (BILAG is scored for arthritis but patient does not 
meet qualifying screening activity required for musculoskeletal BILAG B if <3 swollen tender joints are present).  The adjudicators will review the joint exam to determine if there are enough swollen and tender joints present at screening to meet eligibility. Similarly, BILAG mucocutaneous scoring should be done as per usual BILAG convention at all visits, but the adjudicators with review CLASI scoring to ensure there is enough mucocutaneous activity at screening for eligibility.

3. Have cancer or a history of cancer within 5 years of screening (other than adequately 
resected cutaneous basal cell, squamous cell carcinoma, or carcinoma in situ of the uterine cervix with no evidence of recurrence within the previous 3 years).  If a participant is followed for a history of cancer that is considered to be treated and cured, a note from the oncologist or specialist following the participant for recurrence noting they are aware of and agree with potential participation should be available in the source document.  Potential participants who have an unacceptably high risk of tumor recurrence may be rejected by the Sponsor or their delegate.  Additionally, the participant is required to comply with recommended follow up testing with their specialist of record while participating in the study.
4. Have a history of a major organ transplant (eg, heart, lung, kidney, liver) or 
hematopoietic stem cell/marrow transplant or total lymphoid irradiation.

eg, gastrectomy, clinically significant diabetic gastroenteropathy, or certain types of bariatric surgery such as gastric bypass.  Procedures such as gastric banding or gastric sleeve procedure without a bypass surgery, that simply divide the stomach into separate chambers, are NOT exclusionary.
11. Have active fibromyalgia/myofascial/chronic pain that, in the investigator’s opinion, 
would make it difficult to appropriately assess SLE activity for the purposes of this study.
12. Other acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition including recent (within the 
past year) or active suicidal ideation (defined in Section 8.2.10) or behavior or 
laboratory abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation or study intervention administration or may interfere with the interpretation of study results and, in the judgment of the investigator or sponsor, would make the participant inappropriate for entry into this study.

they have satisfied all of the participant eligibility criteria.  Participants in this study will be stratified based on two factors:
!Screening disease severity (Adjudicated total SLEDAI-2K score <10 versus ≥10).
 
The use of stratification is to facilitate the investigation of the potential impact (if any) of the two stratification factors on efficacy including the participants screening disease severity (SLEDAI score <10 versus ≥10).  A computer-generated randomization schedule will be 
used to assign participants to the treatment groups using an interactive response technology (IRT) system. 
5.3. Lifestyle Considerations
5.3.1. ContraceptionParticipants must understand that they should avoid becoming pregnant during this study.  
The investigator or his or her designee, in consultation with the participant, will confirm that the participant has selected a protocol permitted method of contraception from the permitted list of contraception methods (see Appendix 4) and will confirm that the participant has been 
instructed in its consistent and correct use.  The method of contraception used by the participant should be provided in the source document. At all visits, the investigator or designee will inform the participant of the need to use highly effective contraception consistently and correctly and document the conversation and the participant’s affirmation in the participant’s chart (participants need to affirm their consistent and correct use of at least 1 of the selected methods of contraception).  In addition, the investigator or designee will instruct the participant to call immediately if the selected contraception method is discontinued or if pregnancy is known or suspected in the participant or partner.
5.3.2. Surgery
During the study, no elective surgery should occur without first consulting with the sponsor.  
Preferably, elective surgery should occur before the study or be delayed until participation in the study is completed. 
The sponsor should be notified if a participant requires surgery (including dental surgery) 
during the study to determine whether the participant should discontinue from the study and/or discontinue the study intervention prior to the surgical procedure.  In general, planned surgical procedures should not be performed unless the study intervention has been discontinued for at least 2 days (unless otherwise advised by the sponsor).  In addition, the sponsor should be notified as soon as possible if a participant undergoes a surgical procedure without first informing the study staff.090177e1a05d6b35\A pproved\A pproved On: 22-A pr-2024 15:21 (GMT )CCI

Participants should refrain from all food and liquids (water and medications are permitted) 
for a minimum fast of 8 hours prior to the designated study visit days when a lipid profile panel is scheduled (see Schedule of Activities ).  Fasting is not required for safety laboratory 
tests or PK sampling when a lipid profile panel is not being performed. 
Diabetics who are taking antidiabetic medications or participants who cannot reasonably 
tolerate an 8-12 hour fast should not eat immediately prior to the visit as far as possible.
In addition, it is recommended that participants not smoke (or use any tobacco products) or 
ingest caffeine on study visit days during the 30 minutes prior to blood pressure (BP) and 
heart rate (pulse) measurements. 
5.3.4. Other Requirements
In order to participate in the study, participants must be made aware of the following lifestyle
guidelines and restrictions that apply during and after the study period.  Details of these lifestyle guidelines are provided in the sections as noted. 
!Agree to avoid strenuous exercise on the day of a scheduled study visit and maintain adequate hydration, if possible.
!If enrolled with latent TB, must agree to remain compliant with INH and vitamin B6 therapy to completion of a course of latent TB treatment.
!On study visit days, take prescribed permitted concomitant medication, as needed, prior to the study visit, if it can be administered with water only.
!Must agree to avoid prolonged exposure to the sun and avoid use of tanning booths or other ultraviolet light sources during the study.
!Contact the study site investigator if there are any changes or additions to concomitant medications.
!All participants who are randomized should be encouraged to remain in the study 
through to the end of the double-blind period for safety and efficacy assessments, 
whether or not they continue to receive study intervention or are switched to non-protocol treatment; this is in order to reduce missing data as much as possible.  It is expected that the only reasons for which a participant will withdraw from the study will be for withdrawal of consent or lost to follow-up. This was specifically requested by a regulatory authority to minimize missing data in participants who prematurely discontinue study intervention.

Study intervention is defined as any investigational intervention(s), marketed product(s), 
placebo, or medical device(s) intended to be administered to a study participant according to the study protocol.
For the purposes of this protocol, the term study  intervention may be  used sy nonymously 
with study intervention.6.1. Study Intervention(s) Administered
Blinded PF-06700841 tablets and matching placebo will be provided as tablets for oral 
administration.  The PF-06700841, 5 mg and 25 mg tablets and their matching placebos will be supplied in blisters and labeled according to local regulatory requirements.
6.1.1. Administration
Study intervention will be self-administered by oral administration.  Participants will 
swallow the study intervention whole, and will not manipulate or chew the study intervention prior to swallowing. 
Participants will be encouraged to take the study intervention in the morning after breakfast 
whenever possible; however, the study intervention may be taken with or without food.  On study visit days during the treatment period, participants should be instructed to refrain from dosing at home, and are instructed to take the study intervention at the investigator site.  On study visit days requiring a scheduled lipid panel evaluation, participants should refrain from 
all food and liquids (water and medications are permitted) for a minimum fast of 8 hours 
prior to the study visit.
Participants interrupting study intervention for more than 14 days should be discussed with 
the sponsor for possible withdrawal from the study.
Any temporary hold on dosing of the study intervention during the study should be recorded 
in the case report form (CRF). 090177e1a05d6b35\A pproved\A pproved On: 22-A pr-2024 15:21 (GMT )

1. The investigator or designee must confirm appropriate temperature conditions have 
been maintained during transit for all study interventions received and any 
discrepancies are reported and resolved before use of the study intervention, as applicable for temperature-monitored shipments. 
2. Only participants enrolled in the study may receive study intervention and only 
authorized site staff may supply or administer study intervention.  All study interventions must be stored in a secure, environmentally controlled, and monitored (manual or automated recording) area in accordance with the labeled storage conditions with access limited to the investigator and authorized site staff.  At a minimum, daily minimum and maximum temperatures for all site storage locations must be documented and available upon request.  Data for nonworking days must indicate the minimum and maximum temperature since previously documented for all site storage locations upon return to business.
3. The investigator, institution, or the head of the medical institution (where applicable) 
is responsible for study intervention accountability, reconciliation, and record maintenance (ie, receipt, reconciliation, and final disposition records).  All study interventions will be accounted for using a study intervention accountability form/record.  
4. Further guidance and information for the final disposition of unused study 
interventions are provided in the IP manual.
5. Any storage conditions stated in the SRSD will be superseded by the storage 
conditions stated on the product label. 
6. Study interventions should be stored in their original containers and in accordance 
with the labels. 
7. Site staff will instruct participants on the proper storage requirements for take-home 
study intervention. 
8. Any excursions from the study intervention label storage conditions should be 
reported to Pfizer upon discovery along with any actions taken.  The site should actively pursue options for returning the study intervention to the storage conditions 
described in the labeling, as soon as possible.  Once an excursion is identified, the 
study intervention must be quarantined and not used until Pfizer provides permission to use the study intervention.  It will not be considered a protocol deviation if Pfizer approves the use of the study intervention after the temperature excursion. Use of the study intervention prior to Pfizer approval will be considered a protocol deviation. Specific details regarding the definition of an excursion and information the site should report for each excursion will be provided to the site in the IP manual. 090177e1a05d6b35\A pproved\A pproved On: 22-A pr-2024 15:21 (GMT )

intervention (eg, at the site).  If destruction is authorized to take place at the 
investigator site, the investigator must ensure that the materials are destroyed in compliance with applicable environmental regulations, institutional policy, and any special instructions provided by Pfizer, and all destruction must be adequately documented.
Additional details about accountability, storage, destruction, and excursion reporting can be found in the IP manual.
6.2.1. Preparation and Dispensing
The study intervention will be dispensed using an IRT drug management system at each visit 
from Visit 2 to Visit 16.  A qualified staff member will dispense the study intervention via unique container numbers in the blister cards provided, in quantities appropriate for the study visit schedule.  The participant/caregiver should be instructed to maintain the product in the blister cards provided throughout the course of dosing and return the blister cards to the site at the next study visit.
6.3. Measures to Minimize Bias: Randomization and Blinding
6.3.1. Allocation to Study InterventionAllocation of participants to treatment groups will proceed through the use of an interactive 
response technology (IRT) system (interactive web-based response [IWR]).  The site personnel (study coordinator or specified designee) will be required to enter or select information including but not limited to the user’s identification (ID) and password, the protocol number, and the participant number.  The site personnel will then be provided with a treatment assignment, randomization number, and dispensable unit (DU) or container number when study intervention is being supplied via the IRT system.  The IRT system will provide a confirmation report containing the participant number, randomization number, and DU or container number assigned.  The confirmation report must be stored in the site’s files. 
Study intervention will be dispensed at the study visits summarized in the Schedule of 
Activities . 
Returned study intervention must not be redispensed to the participants.The study-specific IRT reference manual and IP manual will provide the contact information 
and further details on the use of the IRT system.
Participants will be assigned to receive study intervention according to randomization 
scheme.  Investigators will remain blinded to each participant’s assigned study intervention throughout the course of the study.  
6.3.2. Breaking the Blind
The IRT will be programmed with blind-breaking instructions.  In case of an emergency, the 
investigator has the sole responsibility for determining if unblinding of a participant’s 090177e1a05d6b35\A pproved\A pproved On: 22-A pr-2024 15:21 (GMT )

Page 121treatment assignment is warranted.  Participant safety must always be the first consideration 
in making such a determination.  If the investigator decides that unblinding is warranted, the investigator should make every effort to contact the sponsor prior to unblinding a participant’s treatment assignment unless this could delay further management of the participant.  If a participant’s treatment assignment is unblinded, the sponsor must be notified within 24 hours after breaking the blind.  The date and reason that the blind was broken must be recorded in the source documentation and case report form (CRF)/data collection tool (DCT).
The study-specific IRT reference manual and IP manual will provide the contact information 
and further details on the use of the IRT system.
6.4. Study Intervention Compliance
Study intervention will be self-administered by oral administration.  Participant compliance 
will be monitored by the appropriately designated study staff by the accounting of unused study intervention returned by the participant at study visits. 
Participants will be directed to bring blister cards with any remaining study intervention to 
study visits for review.  Compliance with expected consumption of dispensed study intervention will be assessed by comparing the expected number of doses to be taken to the number of doses returned (tablet count) during any given time period.  Compliance will be documented on the CRF and in the source records. 
If compliance is <80%, or >120%, the investigator or designee will counsel the participant 
and ensure steps are taken to improve compliance. If compliance is outside these limits,Pfizer clinical should be contacted as soon as possible to determine if the participant should discontinue study medication due to non-compliance and if any additional safety assessments are needed. Participants interrupting study intervention for more than 14 days, should be discussed with the sponsor for possible withdrawal from the study.
The investigator has the discretion to withdraw any participant from the study for reasons of 
non-compliance with the dosing regimen.  Participants who are non-compliant with scheduled study visits or with study intervention should still be encouraged to return for all scheduled study visits.  Inventory control of all study intervention must be rigorously maintained throughout the duration of the study until all study intervention has been 
accounted for and/or returned to the sponsor (or appointed agent).  Any discrepancies noted 
between drug dispensing records and drug inventory must be reported to the sponsor.
6.5. Concomitant Therapy
Prohibited drugs must be discontinued according to protocol guidelines; a list of prohibited 
drugs with specific discontinuation recommendations is listed in Appendix 13 . 
Participants taking certain medications for SLE, and deriving inadequate benefit from them, may enter the study after a sufficient washout period for that medication.  All biologic disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) are prohibited.  Non-biologic DMARDs other than those listed in Appendix 13 are prohibited.  090177e1a05d6b35\A pproved\A pproved On: 22-A pr-2024 15:21 (GMT )

Page 1226.5.1. Corticosteroids
6.5.1.1. Use of Corticosteroids and Tapering GuidelinesParticipants are allowed to receive a stable dose of oral corticosteroids at study entry as 
described in Section 4 and over the treatment period as described below.  A detailed history 
of corticosteroid use will be collected at screening.  
Participants may be given supplemental (ie, in addition to the stable dose) oral corticosteroids 
at baseline through Week 4 to control SLE disease activity.  The maximum additional dose allowed is 10 mg per day above the Day 1 dose level, for a maximum of 14 days after which the previous dose must be resumed.  
A single intramuscular IM dose of methylprednisolone (Depo-Medrol) 60 mg (or equivalent 
see Appendix 14 ) administered as 1 injection can be substituted for the oral corticosteroid 
allowed increase described above through Week 4 to control SLE disease activity.  The baseline oral corticosteroid dose must not be modified in participants who receive IM corticosteroids. 
To minimize potential long term side effects (including infection risk), PIs are required to 
decrease corticosteroids to the lowest safely tolerated dose when appropriate.  The tapering goal for prednisone (or equivalent see Appendix 14 ) is 7.5 mg per day or less by the end of 
the two tapering windows (Week 12 and Week 40), however the corticosteroid tapering schedule is flexible and at the discretion of individual PIs based on participants’ clinical signs and symptoms.  Corticosteroid tapering is allowed only during Weeks 2-12 and Weeks 24-40. 
The decision to initiate or intensify corticosteroid therapy should be carefully considered by 
the investigator, and depends on various factors, including the severity of the participants’ symptoms and type of organ involvement.  However, an important outcome in this study will be whether or not PF-06700841 permits tapering of corticosteroid use beyond tapering achieved with background therapy alone. In order to maximize the ability to detect a difference in corticosteroid use across arms in this study, beginning at Week 2 and continuing through Week 12, and again during Weeks 24-40, steroid tapering to an oral corticosteroid (OCS) dose of ≤7.5 mg/day is required in all participants when appropriate. 
The following guidance must be adhered to for steroid tapering:
1. Do not need to taper steroids if the participant has new, worsening, still active SLE 
disease activity and meets any of the below criteria:
!SLEDAI-2K activity which is worsened compared to baseline in major organ 
systems (renal, CNS, cardiopulmonary, vasculitis, fever, thrombocytopenia, or 
haemolytic anaemia, or gastrointestinal activity).
!BILAG – any new BILAG A or B.
!Moderate to severe skin disease as reflected by a CLASI activity score of ≥10.090177e1a05d6b35\A pproved\A pproved On: 22-A pr-2024 15:21 (GMT )

PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL 
Page 1232. Steroids MUST be tapered if the participating meets the following criteria:
!The total SLEDAI score decreases by 4 points from baseline; AND
!There is no new BILAG A or B.
3. Participants that do not meet the criteria in one or two of the scenarios above, must 
attempt to taper at the investigator's discretion.
For participants who have tapered during Weeks 2-12 and Weeks 24-40, the dose may be 
increased once during each of the 2 taper windows to a maximum dose of 20 mg/day (prednisone equivalent see Appendix 14) for a maximum of 14 days, after which the previous 
dose must be resumed.  
Between Weeks 12-24, steroid doses should remain as stable as possible.  No change in 
steroid dosing, either up or down, is allowed between Week 40-Week 52. In addition, any time prior to Week 28, if the dose of oral corticosteroids exceeds 30 mg/day, this should be discussed with the medical monitor and may result in discontinuation of study intervention.
6.5.1.2. Record of Corticosteroids 
Participants will be required to follow the corticosteroid dosing guidelines during the 
treatment period of the study.  The investigator/site staff will review the participants corticosteroid use at each study visit and record in the participant’s CRF.  It is recommended that corticosteroids be tapered as quickly as clinically feasible.  No change in steroid dosing is allowed between Weeks 12-24 and Weeks 40-52.  For concomitant use of corticosteroids for hypersensitivity reactions, insect bites or asthmatic exacerbations see Appendix 13 . 
In addition, the intake of oral corticosteroids taken by the participants during the study will be captured on a separate CRF.  The CRF page will capture the name of the corticosteroid taken, indication for use, total daily dose, route of administration, and start date and stop dates of administration.
6.5.1.3. Management of Severe Flare and/or Worsening of Disease 
During the treatment period, those participants who experience a severe flare requiring new 
or increased doses of immunosuppressants (including new or increased doses of corticosteroids beyond that outlined in Appendix 13: List of Prohibited and Permitted 
Concomitant Medications ) or hospitalization, or worsening of disease requiring new or 
increased doses of immunosuppressants or hospitalization, will be discontinued from treatment, and will receive no further study intervention. 
In addition, those participants who require oral corticosteroid doses greater than 15 mg/day 
prednisone (or equivalent see Appendix 14 ) at or after the Week 28 visit will be discontinued 
from treatment at that time point, other than those participants undergoing tapering and who receive the allowed single increase in corticosteroids ( Section 6.5.1.1).  090177e1a05d6b35\A pproved\A pproved On: 22-A pr-2024 15:21 (GMT )

Page 125The early discontinuation visit applies only to participants who are randomized and then are 
prematurely withdrawn from the study.  The participant will be permanently discontinued both from the study intervention and from the study at that time.
If a participant withdraws from the study, he/she may request destruction of any remaining 
samples, but data already generated from the samples will continue to be available, and may be used to protect the integrity of existing analyses.  The investigator must document any such requests in the site study records.
If the participant withdraws from the study and also withdraws consent (see below) for 
disclosure of future information, no further evaluations should be performed and no additional data should be collected.  The sponsor may retain and continue to use any data collected before such withdrawal of consent.
When a participant withdraws from the study because of an SAE, the SAE must be recorded 
on the CRF and reported on the Clinical Trial (CT) SAE Report.
Lack of completion of all or any of the withdrawal/early termination procedures will not be 
viewed as protocol deviations so long as the participant’s safety was preserved.
Withdrawal of Consent: Participants who request to discontinue receipt of study intervention will remain in the study 
throughout Week 56 and must continue to be followed for protocol-specified follow-up procedures.  The only exception to this is when a participant specifically withdraws consent for any further contact with him or her or persons previously authorized by the participant to provide this information.  The withdrawal of consent should be explained in detail in the medical records by the investigator, as to whether the withdrawal is only from further receipt of study intervention or also from study procedures and/or posttreatment study follow-up, and entered on the appropriate CRF page.  In the event that vital status (whether the participant is alive or dead) is being measured, publicly available information should be used to determine vital status only as appropriately directed in accordance with local law.
7.3. Lost to Follow-up 
A participant will be considered lost to follow-up if he or she repeatedly fails to return for 
scheduled visits and is unable to be contacted by the study site.
The following actions must be taken if a participant fails to return to the clinic for a required 
study visit:
!The site must attempt to contact the participant and reschedule the missed visit as 
soon as possible and counsel the participant on the importance of maintaining the 
assigned visit schedule and ascertain whether or not the participant wishes to and/or should continue in the study;090177e1a05d6b35\A pproved\A pproved On: 22-A pr-2024 15:21 (GMT )

Discontinuation of specific sites or of the study as a whole is handled as part of Appendix 1 .
8. STUDY ASSESSMENTS AND PROCEDURES
The investigator (or an appropriate delegate at the investigator site) must obtain a signed and 
dated ICD before performing any study-specific procedures.  
Study procedures and their timing are summarized in the Schedule of Activities. Protocol
waivers or exemptions are not allowed.Immediate safety concerns should be discussed with the sponsor immediately upon 
occurrence or awareness to determine if the participant should continue or discontinue study intervention.
Adherence to the study design requirements, including those specified in the Schedule of 
Activities , is essential and required for study conduct.
All screening evaluations must be completed and reviewed to confirm that potential 
participants meet all eligibility criteria.  The investigator will maintain a screening log to record details of all participants screened and to confirm eligibility or record reasons for screening failure, as applicable.
Procedures conducted as part of the participant’s routine clinical management (eg, blood 
count) and obtained before signing of the ICD may be utilized for screening or baseline purposes provided the procedures met the protocol-specified criteria and were performed within the time frame defined in the Schedule of Activities.
Every effort should be made to ensure that protocol-required tests and procedures are completed as described.  However, it is anticipated that from time to time there may be circumstances outside the control of the investigator that may make it unfeasible to perform the test.  In these cases, the investigator must take all steps necessary to ensure the safety and well-being of the participant.  When a protocol-required test cannot be performed, the investigator will document the reason for the missed test and any corrective and preventive actions that he or she has taken to ensure that required processes are adhered to as soon as possible.  The study team must be informed of these incidents in a timely manner.090177e1a05d6b35\A pproved\A pproved On: 22-A pr-2024 15:21 (GMT )

The total blood sampling volume for individual participants during the treatment period is 
approximately 470 mL.  The actual collection times of blood sampling may change.  Additional blood samples may be taken for safety assessments at times specified by Pfizer, provided the total volume taken during the study does not exceed 550 mL during any period of 60 consecutive days.
Screening For screening procedures, see Schedule of Activities .
Participants will be screened within 49 days prior to administration of the initial dose of 
study intervention in order to confirm that they meet the participant eligibility criteria for the study.  The investigator (or appropriate delegate at the investigator site) will obtain informed consent from each participant in accordance with the procedures described in Appendix 1. 
Screening visits may occur over multiple visits to achieve all of the required testing.
Screening laboratory tests with abnormal results may be repeated once to confirm abnormal 
results.  The last value will be used to determine eligibility.  If results return to normal within the 7-week screening period, the participant may enter the study. 
Participants who do not meet the eligibility criteria (screen failure was determined) may be 
re-screened once at a later date (which must be at least ≥2 weeks after screen failure was 
determined to initiate any re-screening procedures).  Participants who are pregnant at the time of their initial screening visit may not be rescreened.  Any participant who is re-screened must be re-consented and receive a new participant number.  All activities required for the screening visit must be repeated. Participants are not permitted to rescreen if they have any of the following positive laboratory results: Hepatitis B surface antigen, Hepatitis B cDNA, Hepatitis C antibody, HIV screen or an IGRA.
Participant eligibility will be reviewed and confirmed by the sponsor and/or a consultant to 
the sponsor.  Sites will be required to submit appropriate documentation of participants deemed to be eligible to review and approve.  Participants cannot be randomized into the study until eligibility is confirmed.

8.1. Efficacy Assessments
8.1.1. Rater QualificationsFor specific rating assessments, only qualified raters will be allowed to evaluate and/or rate 
participants in this study.  The minimum qualifications a rater must meet for each study rating assessment will be outlined in the Rater Assessment Manual provided to each participating site.  The level of experience with the target population (or equivalent), specific scale experience, and certification required (if applicable) will be listed and used to determine whether a rater is approved for a given assessment.  Proposed raters who do not meet specific criteria but who may be qualified based on unique circumstances may be individually reviewed by the study clinical team to determine whether or not a waiver may be issued.  The rater must become certified to perform selected study assessments before he or she can participate in the conduct of the study.  For specifically defined assessments, rater training and standardization exercises may be conducted, and written and signed documentation will be provided by the site for each rater’s certification.  In return, each site will be provided written and signed documentation outlining each rater’s certification for specific study assessments.  Recertification may be required at periodic intervals during the study.  The raters who administer specific study assessments will be documented in a centralized location and all site staff who administer ratings will be verified in the site study documentation during the conduct of the study.
8.1.2. American College of Rheumatology (ACR) Criteria for the Classification of SLE
Eligibility for the study will be evaluated according to the 1997 update on the 1982 revised

Page 129Appendix 9 .  These criteria require that participants have met at least 4 of the 11 criteria 
either simultaneously or in succession to be classified as having SLE.17
8.1.3. Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics (SLICC) criteria 
The SLICC criteria for SLE classification requires: 1) Fulfillment of at least four criteria, 
with at least one clinical criterion AND one immunologic criterion OR 2) Lupus nephritis as the sole clinical criterion in the presence of ANA or anti-dsDNA antibodies. 
8.1.4. Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Responder Index (SRI)-4
The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of three PF-06700841 QD dose 
levels (15 mg, 30 mg and 45 mg) relative to placebo in participants with active SLE using the Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Responder Index (SRI) at 52 weeks.  The primary endpoint of this study is the SRI-4 response rate at Week 52.  The components of this composite endpoint are the Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index-2000 (SLEDAI-2K),
18the British Isles Lupus Assessment Group (BILAG) 2004,19and the 
Physician’s Global Assessment (PhGA). 
The endpoint is designed to assure that if improvements occur, they are not accompanied by 
clinically-relevant worsening.  The SRI-4 requires demonstration of improvement in disease activity as measured by at least a 4-point reduction in SLEDAI-2K score as the first step in identifying a responder.  Since the SLEDAI-2K 4-point improvement threshold is based on a published threshold for clinical meaningfulness, and because reduction in the score generally requires normalization of a manifestation, not just improvement, an SRI-4 response is also considered clinically meaningful.  Once achieving at least, a 4-point reduction in the SLEDAI-2K, a participant must also show no worsening of disease as measured by BILAG and PhGA to be considered a responder.  If either tool shows worsening, the participant is not considered a responder, despite an improvement in the SLEDAI-2K.  All 3 of the components are needed to be scored as a responder for purposes of the analysis. 
In order to be classified as a responder, participants meet all of the following criteria 
compared with baseline:
!≥4 point reduction in the SLEDAI-2K score, and
!No new BILAG A organ domain score or 2 new BILAG B organ domain scores, and
!No worsening (<0.3 point increase) in PhGA score.
8.1.4.1. Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index -2000 (SLEDAI-2K)
The SRI-4 uses the SLEDAI-2K (see Appendix 11 ) as a rigorous assessment of the 
improvement in a participants disease activity.18
The SLEDAI-2K contains 24 individual manifestations which will be scored by the 
investigator as either present or absent at the time of the visit or within the preceding 30 days of the visit.  Each manifestation must be related to lupus; 16 are clinical items and 8 are 090177e1a05d6b35\A pproved\A pproved On: 22-A pr-2024 15:21 (GMT )

Page 130based on laboratory results.  The manifestations can also be grouped into 9 organ systems for 
analysis (CNS, vascular, renal, musculoskeletal, cardiovascular and respiratory, mucocutaneous, immunologic, constitutional and hematologic).  Scores are weighted from 1 to 8 points, based on the seriousness of the manifestation. 
For the purposes of completing the SLEDAI at Weeks 2 and 6  
 from the baseline and 
Week 4 visits should be used respectively.8.1.4.2. British Isles Lupus Assessment Group (BILAG) 2004
The BILAG 2004 index see Appendix 12 is an assessment of the extent and severity of 
disease activity in individual organ systems.
19  It is an effective tool to detect worsening in a 
specific organ system because it is responsive to worsening severity of disease manifestations 
as well as the onset of new disease manifestations in specific organ domains.  Only features attributable to SLE disease activity are recorded and not due to damage, infection, thrombosis (in absence of inflammatory process) or other conditions. 
The BILAG 2004 contains 97 lupus related manifestations given a score of either new, 
worse, same, improving, or not present.  The assessment refers to manifestations occurring in the last 4 weeks compared with the previous 4 weeks.  Multiple manifestations and laboratory test (as applicable) are then combined into 9 organ domains (constitutional, mucocutaneous, neuropsychiatric, musculoskeletal, cardiorespiratory, GI, ophthalmic, renal and hematological).  BILAG scoring is based on the “intention to treatment” paradigm.  Each organ domain is given a score from A to E depending on the SLE clinical manifestations.  An “A” score represents an increase in disease activity sufficient to normally require intensification of therapy with steroids or immunosuppressants.  A “B” score represents moderate, reversible manifestations requiring antimalarials, NSAIDs, or low dose steroids.  A “C” score reflects mild, stable disease.  A “D” score indicates no current disease activity in a previously affected organ system.  An “E” score indicates the organ system has never been involved. 
8.1.4.3. Physician Global Assessment (PhGA)
The Physician Global Assessment (PhGA) is a measure of worsening in the participants 
general health status rather than the disease activity in a specific organ (see Appendix 18).  
The investigator will mark a visual analog scale answering the question “Evaluate the participants lupus activity since the last visit using the visual analog scale” indicating the participants overall disease activity at a particular visit.  The investigator’s response will be recorded using a visual analog scale (VAS) by placing a mark on the scale between 0 (none), 1 (mild), 2 (moderate), and 3 (severe). 090177e1a05d6b35\A pproved\A pproved On: 22-A pr-2024 15:21 (GMT )CCI

8.1.5. modified SELENA-SLEDAI Flare Index (mSSFI)
The secondary objective is to assess the severe flare rate in PF-06700841 treated participants 
relative to placebo.  The corresponding key secondary endpoint of this study is the time to first severe flare as measured by the modified SELENA-SLEDAI SLE Flare Index (SFI);
20
(see Appendix 19 ).  This index categorizes SLE flares as either “mild or moderate” or 
“severe” based on 6 variables:  change in SLEDAI-2K score from most recent assessment to current, change in signs or symptoms of disease activity, change in prednisone (or equivalent see Appendix 14) dose, use of new medication for disease activity or hospitalization, change 
in PhGA score, or hospitalization fo r SLE activity (sev ere flar e only). 
The modified SELENA-SLEDAI Flare Index (mSSFI) requires that a participant who has a
SLEDAI score >12 is considered as having a severe flare only if they have one other component present.  This modification was made because participants entering the trial with high disease activity (ie, ≥11) could too easily trigger a severe flare by minor increases in 
SLEDAI score. 
Lupus flares will also be assessed using an experimental version of the modified 
SELENA-SLEDAI Flare Index (mSSFI), which eliminates medication criteria from the modified SELENA-SLEDAI SFI.
21 
  All severe 
SLE flares will be reviewed by a blinded central adjudication committee as discussed in Section 9.5.2.
8.1.6. British Isles Lupus Assessment Group Based Composite Lupus Assessment 
(BICLA)
An additional endpoint that will be evaluated in this study is the responder rate according to a 
composite endpoint, British Isles Lupus Assessment Group-Based Composite Lupus Assessment (BICLA) that includes the BILAG-2004, SLEDAI-2K, and PhGA of disease activity.  The BILAG-2004 index was selected as the central score on the basis of its comprehensiveness, ability to capture partial improvement, and the clinical relevance of its scoring system.

8.1.7. Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics (SLICC)/American College of Rheumatology (ACR) Damage Index for SLE
The Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics (SLICC)/ACR Damage Index for 
SLE records damage occurring in participants with SLE regardless of the cause (see Appendix 10 ).  The damage index does not include hematologic items such as cytopenias, 
since these can be a waxing and waning phenomena; other manifestations need to have been present for at least 6 months.  It has been found to be well-defined and reliable for measuring organ damage.  The SLICC/ACR damage index is useful both as a descriptor for participants included in studies, as well as an outcome measure for therapeutic trials and prognosis.
23
8.1.8. Cutaneous Lupus Erythematosus Disease Area and Severity Index (CLASI)
The Cutaneous Lupus Erythematosus Disease Area and Severity Index (CLASI; see 
Appendix 20) was designed to convert subjective elements of disease severity into objective data by means of a scoring system.
24  This validated index has separate scores for activity 
and damage so that it is possible to monitor the course of the disease over time and in response to therapy.  The CLASI activity (CLASI-A) score is based upon degree of erythema, scale, mucous membrane lesions, and non-scarring alopecia.  Increased weight is assigned to the face and neck, relative to other less frequently involved parts of the body.
8.1.9. Photography
Photography will only be performed at sites in the United States and is an optional procedure. 
For participants with a CLASI-A score ≥10 at baseline, clinical photographs of the area of 
active skin involvement should be obtained at baseline, Week 12, Week 24, Week 52, where 
possible (and, if applicable, at participant withdrawal or early withdrawal visit) as per Schedule of Activities.  Areas photographed should be recorded in study documents so that the same areas will be photographed at the designated time points as per the Schedule of 
Activities .  Additional photographs may also be taken at the investigator’s discretion.  
All photographs will be de-identified and will be used for purposes of this study only, they may also be used in external disclosures. 090177e1a05d6b35\A pproved\A pproved On: 22-A pr-2024 15:21 (GMT )

8.1.10. Joint Assessment (28 Swollen and Tender/Painful Joint Counts)
The joint assessment for this study will consist of the swollen joint count (SJC; see 
Appendix 21) and the tender/painful joint count (TJC) and will be carried out on 28 joints: the shoulders, elbows, wrists (radiocarpal, carpal, and carpometacarpal bones were considered as a single unit), metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joints (MCP 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5), thumb interphalangeal joint, proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joints (PIP 2, 3, 4, and 5), along with the following joints: temporomandibular joints, sternoclavicular joints, acromioclavicular joints, hip, ankle joints, transverse tarsal joints, metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joints (MTP 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5),  interphalangeal joint 1 (foot) and proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joints of the foot (PIP 2, 3, 4 and 5) and the knees.  Artificial and ankylosed joints will be excluded from the assessments.
Participants taking maintenance or as needed (PRN) NSAIDS/analgesics, or lower potency 
opioid should not take a dose of these medications within 12 hours prior to the joint assessment visits in order to allow a true assessment of the joint swelling and tenderness to be conducted.
Swelling and tenderness will be graded on a 2-point scale as described in Table 3.  Joint 
count is recorded on the CRF as follows for this study: right tender joint, left tender joint and right swelling joint, left swelling joint.

The EuroQoL 5 Dimensions (EQ-5D-5L) is a validated, standardized, generic instrument 
used to measure health states and utilities in various disease areas.  The measure contains 5 items that cover mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression, as well as a visual analogue scale.
32,33  Scores from the 5 domains maybe 
used to calculate a single index value, also known as a utility score.  
There is also one visual analogue scale (VAS) item which records the respondent’s self-rated 
health where the endpoints are labelled ‘Best imaginable health state’ and ‘Worst imaginable health state’.  A copy of the EQ-5D-5L questionnaire can be found in the PRO manual. 
8.1.12.6. Patient’s Global Assessment (PtGA)
The PtGA is an overall assessment of impact of SLE on a participant’s health. Participants 
will rate their overall health as a result of SLE in the past 4 weeks on a 11-point Numeric Rating Scale with a score range of 0 (Very well) to 10 (very poorl y). Lower sc ores on the 
scale suggest better health. A copy of the PtGA can be found in the PRO manual.

This questionnaire is only collected for participants enrolled after protocol amendment 4 or 5 has been approved.
8.1.12.10. Health Care Resource Use (HCRU)
Participants utilization of the health care system outside of the clinical trial will be assessed 
using the Health Care Resource Use (HCRU) questionnaire.  Questions will be asked to gauge any physician and specialist visits as hospitalization and emergency room visits stratified by those which are SLE related or not.  The questionnaire is to be completed by the patient.  A copy of the HCRU can be found in the PRO manual. 
8.2. Safety Assessments
Planned time points for all safety assessments are provided in the Schedule of Activities.  
Unscheduled clinical laboratory measurements may be obtained at any time during the study 
to assess any perceived safety concerns.
8.2.1. Assessments at Screening Only
8.2.1.1. Medical HistoryComplete medical history, SLE disease history (including disease duration, extent of disease, 
and prior treatments), cardiovascular disease history, venous thromboembolic event history and smoking history will be collected at Screening. 
8.2.1.2. Chest X-Ray
Chest radiograph (posterior-anterior and lateral views are recommended, however, local 
guidelines should be followed) or other approved diagnostic test (ie, CT scan with or without contrast or MRI) with no evidence of current, active TB or previous inactive TB, general infections, heart failure, malignancy, or other clinically significant findings in the chest taken at screening or within 12 weeks prior to Study Day 1 and read by a qualified radiologist.  Documentation of the official reading must be located and available in the source documentation. A chest CT or MRI may be obtained in place of the chest x-ray, PA and lateral view, only with advance permission of Pfizer. If a chest CT or MRI shows any 
abnormalities (nodules, infiltrates, scarring, stranding, etc), these must be documented to be 
stable compared to a prior chest radiograph or MRI obtained at least 12 months previously.
Participants who entered the study with latent TB or who test positive for QFT-G during the 
study may have a chest x-ray (posterior-anterior and lateral views are recommended, however, local guidelines should be followed) or other approved diagnostic test (ie, CT scan with or without contrast or MRI) done at Weeks 24 and/or 56 of the study to monitor for active TB.  If there is any evidence of active disease on the chest radiograph, study intervention must be stopped immediately (unless study intervention has already been stopped) and Pfizer Clinical should be notified.  090177e1a05d6b35\A pproved\A pproved On: 22-A pr-2024 15:21 (GMT )

A complete physical examination will include, at a minimum, head, ears, eyes, nose, mouth, 
skin, heart and lung examinations, lymph nodes, and gastrointestinal, musculoskeletal, and neurological systems. 
A brief physical examination will include, at a minimum, assessments of general appearance, 
heart, lungs, skin, musculoskeletal and any other patient and participant-reported symptoms. 
Physical examinations may be conducted by a physician, trained physician's assistant, or 
nurse practitioner as acceptable according to local regulation. 
Height and weight will also be measured and recorded as per the Schedule of Activities. For 
measuring weight, a scale with appropriate range and resolution is used and must be placed 
on a stable, flat surface.  Participants must remove shoes, bulky layers of clothing, and jackets so that only light clothing remains.  They must also remove the contents of their pockets and remain still during measurement of weight. 
8.2.3. Vital Signs
Vital signs (blood pressure, pulse rate, respirations and temperature) will be measured after 
5 minutes of rest as indicated in the Schedule of Activities . 
Blood pressure (BP) will be measured using a standard calibrated blood pressure measuring device.  A BP device that uses multiple cuff sizes for the participant based on the arm circumference is required.  The arm circumference at the midpoint of the length of the upper arm should be measured to determine the appropriate cuff size in accordance with the specifications of the BP measuring device.  The properly sized and calibrated blood pressure cuff will be used to measure blood pressure each time.  The use of an automated device for measuring BP and pulse rate is acceptable, although, when done manually, pulse rate will be measured in the brachial/radial artery for at least 30 seconds. 
Participants should be seated in a chair, back supported, and arms bared (free of restrictions 
such as rolled-up sleeves, etc) and supported at the level of the heart.  Measurements should be taken on the same arm (preferably the non-dominant arm) at each visit throughout the study after 5 minutes of rest and recorded to the nearest mm Hg.  Participants should refrain from smoking (or use any tobacco products) or ingesting caffeine during the 30 minutes prior to the measurements. 
When the timing of BP and pulse rate measurements coincides with a blood collection or
other study procedure, BP and pulse rate should be obtained first.
Since all clinical assessments were validated using oral temperatures, it is important to 
ONLY take oral temperatures on study; oral thermometers will be supplied by the Sponsor if requested.090177e1a05d6b35\A pproved\A pproved On: 22-A pr-2024 15:21 (GMT )

Page 1388.2.4. Electrocardiograms
Standard 12-Lead ECGs should be collected at times specified in the Schedule of Activities
section of this protocol using the study specific ECG machine that automatically calculates 
the heart rate and measures PR, QT, and QTc intervals and QRS complex.  All scheduled ECGs should be performed after the participant has rested quietly for at least 10 minutes in a supine position and prior to any blood collections. 
A single ECG measurement will be collected at all scheduled visits except at baseline on 
Day 1 where ECG will be collected in triplicate approximately 2-4 minutes apart.  At Week 2 visit, an ECG will be collected approximately 3 hours after dosing at the study site.
  The 
Day 1 ECG values (average of the triplicate measures) will serve as each participant’sbaseline values. If Day 1 ECG is missing, then screening ECG will serve as baseline value.To ensure safety of the participants, a qualified individual (investigator or sub-investigator) at the investigator site will make comparisons to baseline measurements.  ECG data will be submitted to a central laboratory for measurement.  The final ECG report from the central laboratory should be maintained in the participant’s source documentation and be the final interpretation of the ECG recording.  Any clinically significant changes from the baseline Day 1 ECG may potentially be AEs ( Appendix 7 ) and should be evaluated further, as 
clinically warranted. 
In some cases, it may be appropriate to repeat abnormal ECGs to rule out improper lead 
placement as contributing to the ECG abnormality.  It is important that leads be placed in the same positions each time in order to achieve precise ECG recordings.  If a machine-read QTc value is prolonged, as defined above, repeat measurements may not be necessary if a qualified medical provider’s interpretation determines that the QTc values are in the acceptable range.
ECG values of potential clinical concern are listed in Appendix 7 .
8.2.5. Hepatitis Screening and Monitoring
During the study screening period, all participants will be screened for hepatitis B surface 
antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis surface antibody (HBsAb) and hepatitis B core antibody (HBcAb). 
!Participants who are HBsAg positive will be excluded.
!Participants who have negative HBsAg, positive HBcAb, and negative HBsAb will be excluded.

In addition, all participants will be screened for hepatitis C virus antibody (HCV Ab) during the study screening period.  Participants who are positive for HCV Ab will be reflex-tested for hepatitis C virus ribonucleic acid (HCV RNA) and, if HCV RNA is positive, they will be screen-failed.
If hepatitis B reactivation has been confirmed during the study based upon the above 
evaluations, the participant should not receive further doses of the study intervention.  Investigators should consider such as event as medically important and report the event as an SAE in accordance with the process described in Appendix 3 .
8.2.6. Tuberculosis (TB) Screening and Monitoring
8.2.6.1. Interferon Gamma Release Assay (IGRA) Tuberculin TestParticipants should be screened for TB using an interferon gamma release assay (IGRA) and 
it is preferable that a QuantiFERON
®gold test be obtained and sent to the central laboratory, 
although it is acceptable for a locally approved IGRA to be used per local guidelines.  IGRA will be tested during screening or within 12 weeks prior to Day 1.  The following are acceptable IGRA assays:  T-SPOT
®TB test, QuantiFERON®-TB Gold In-Tube test 
(QFT-GIT), QuantiFERON®-TB Gold test (QFT-G) or QuantiFERON®-TB Gold Plus test 
(QFT-G Plus).  Site personnel should follow the processing and analyses steps based on the assay chosen.  Ensure incubation steps are followed as appropriate.  Documentation of IGRA product used and the test result must be in the participants source documentation.
A Mantoux skin test is not an acceptable test in this study and an IGRA test must be 
performed.  An initial IGRA should be performed at the central laboratory so that at least one set of results will be available in the Pfizer database.  If another test is required, it may be performed locally, and a T-SPOT
®TB test (if available) would be preferred than another 
QuantiFERON®test.
Procedure for Indeterminate or Positive interferon gamma releaseassay tests at screening

Infectious disease and/or pulmonary specialist consultation
1. If the pulmonary specialist diagnoses latent TB during the screening period, the 
pulmonary specialist will recommend a treatment for latent TB aligned with the participant’s best interest and local standard of care.  The local incidence of multidrug resistant TB should be considered in determining how the participant is treated. Once the infectious disease and/or pulmonary specialist report has been obtained, the following must occur:
!Report is translated into English and the local incidence rate of multi-drug 
resistant TB in the participant’s home area must be provided to the sponsor for review. 
!If INH and vitamin B6 therapy are considered by the infectious disease and/or 
pulmonary specialist to be adequate treatment for latent TB for the prospective participant, the participant must agree to continue therapy during the study to complete the course of treatment for latent TB.  If the participant agrees with this plan and the site monitors for compliance with this regimen on study, the participant may be eligible for randomization if they meet all other inclusion requirements and none of the exclusion criteria.  The prospective participant agreement to take INH and B6 during the study and confirmation the site will track the subject’s compliance appropriately should also be provided to the Sponsor.
!Following review of specialist report, incidence of multidrug resistant TB and participants acceptance of required treatment for latent TB, the participant may be eligible for the study if all other eligibility criteria are met.  The only therapy acceptable for on-study treatment of latent TB is a 9-month course of INH plus vitamin B6.
!For participants who enter the study with latent TB on INH and vitamin B6, a follow up chest CT will be required at Week 56.  090177e1a05d6b35\A pproved\A pproved On: 22-A pr-2024 15:21 (GMT )

!The consultant’s report is translated into English and the local incidence rate of 
multi-drug resistant TB in the participant’s home area must be provided to the sponsor for review. 
!If the participant has begun treatment for latent TB with therapy other than INH and B6, the consultant and participant must agree that changing to INH and B6 is in the participant’s best interest.  The only therapy acceptable for on-study treatment of latent TB is the equivalent of a 9-month course of INH plus vitamin B6. Adjustment of the treatment period or acceptance of treatments other than INH and B6 prior to screening should be discussed with Pfizer Clinical and may take into account the duration and type of therapy that has been documented prior to screening.
!If the participant agrees with this treatment plan and the site monitors for 
compliance with this regimen on study, the participant may be eligible for randomization if they meet all other inclusion requirements and none of the exclusion criteria.  The prospective participant agreement to take INH and B6 during the study and confirmation the site will track the participant’s compliance appropriately should also be provided to the Sponsor.
!For participants who enter the study with latent TB on INH and vitamin B6, a follow-up chest CT will be required at Week 56.  
Refer to lab manual for any additional processing information and shipping instructions.
8.2.6.2. Additional Measures for Tuberculosis (TB)Monitoring
In addition to the tuberculosis (TB) screening already in place, additional testing for TB has 
been added at the Week 24 visit and at the Week 56 visit/end of study visit (and if applicable, at participant withdrawal/early withdrawal visit) to monitor for new cases of TB during the course of the study.  The following measures have been included in this protocol to ensure the continued safety of participants and to further mitigate the risk of Mycobacterium 
tuberculosis infection:
!Participants should be carefully monitored throughout the study for signs and symptoms of TB, such as chest pain, difficulty breathing, wheezing, fever, cough, excessive sweating (especially at night), lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, new fatigue, anorexia or new unplanned weight loss.  Participants with these symptoms should be carefully evaluated to determine if these symptoms are due to SLE, TB, or other unrelated cause.  Referrals to infectious disease and/or pulmonology specialists should be considered on an individual basis.

Procedure for Indeterminate or Positive interferon gamma release assay tests at Week 24 and/or Week 56:
!Indeterminate interferon gamma release assay: At both Week 24 and 56 the test 
should be repeated.  The IGRA assay to be utilized for the repeat test should be a different assay than the first test (eg, T-SPOT
®).  
!Participants who have an IGRA test result at Week 24 or Week 56 that is indeterminate should be seen by an infectious disease and/or pulmonary specialist who should determine whether the risk of TB infection is low (ie, it would be acceptable for the participant to remain in the study and continue immunosuppressant treatment without additional action).  A report from the infectious disease and/or pulmonary specialist should be available in the source document.  If the specialist determines that the risk of TB infection is low, the participant may remain in the study as per the Schedule of Activities.  If the 
consultant determines that the risk of TB infection is not low, the recommendations of the consultant to determine whether active or latent TB infection is present should be followed and the final determination of the participants status and results of any other diagnostic testing reported to the Sponsor.
!Positive interferon gamma release assay : At both Week 24 and 56 the test should 
be repeated.  The IGRA assay to be utilized for the repeat test should be a different assay than the first (eg, T-SPOT
®). The participant should be thoroughly evaluated to 
exclude active TB.  The sponsor should be notified as soon as possible. These participants should have study drug dosing interrupted immediately until details have been discussed with the sponsor and it has been determined whether the participanthas active or latent TB. Evaluations should include, and may not be limited to:
!Participant information to include at a minimum the following: 
!Close contact with someone with active TB (home, work, school, etc).
!Work at a job that has an increased risk of acquiring TB (for example a 
healthcare or nursing home worker).
!Physical examination.
!Check for symptoms (fever, cough, weight loss).
!Consultation with an infectious disease and/or pulmonary specialist should be 
obtained as soon as possible to determine whether the participant has active or latent TB. Radiographic studies required for diagnosis should be obtained as 090177e1a05d6b35\A pproved\A pproved On: 22-A pr-2024 15:21 (GMT )

Page 143per the recommendation of the consultant. The subject should stop study 
intervention immediately until the pulmonary specialist is able to confirm if the participant has latent or active TB.
!At Week 24, if the infectious disease and/or pulmonary specialist determines that the participant has active TB, the participant must discontinue study interventionpermanently and should follow the infectious disease and/or pulmonary specialistrecommendation for treatment. Sites should be aware that in many regions, new active or latent TB is a reportable disease and may require reporting to the local public health office. Investigators should consider such an event as medically important and report the event as an SAE in accordance with the process described in Appendix 3 .
!At Week 24, if the infectious disease and/or pulmonary specialist determines that the participant has latent TB, the consultant should determine if INH and Vitamin B6 would be adequate therapy for latent TB.  If the specialist agrees that INH and Vitamin B6 treatment is adequate treatment for latent TB, the participant agrees to start INH and B6 treatment and to comply with the treatment during the study, the participant should start INH and vitamin B6 treatment immediately, interrupt study intervention for 14 days and obtain blood chemistry assessments to 
include at a minimum ALT, AST, and bilirubin prior to re-starting study intervention.
!The participant may restart study drug after these laboratory assessments have 
been determined to be in the normal range. 
!For any clinically significant laboratory results, Investigators should consider such an event as medically important and report the event as an SAE in accordance with the process described in Appendix 3 .  
!The Sponsor strongly recommends that the participants who develop latent TB on study, should receive a 9-month course of INH and B6, INH and B6 therapy following the completion of study participation is at the discretion of the investigator.
!The participant is required to have an additional chest X-ray or chest CT at 
Week 56.

!If treatment with high dose corticosteroids (oral doses ≥60 mg/day prednisone [or 
equivalent see Appendix 14 ] or pulse IV doses) is required to treat a documented 
severe lupus flare, or intercurrent medical condition, the participant should be evaluated for TB as soon as clinically feasible and preferably before starting the high dose corticosteroid treatment.  In areas of high background TB prevalence, it is recommended that the evaluation be repeated following corticosteroid taper.
8.2.7. Monitoring for Infections
Participants will be monitored for development of any infection (viral, bacterial, and fungal).  
Infections will be classified as either treated or non-treated infections.  All treated infections occurring during the study require identification of the causative organism, if feasible, whether by culture, antigen assay, serology, etc. (as appropriate) and the results (eg, any identified organisms or absence of growth) recorded in the CRF.
Treated infections are infections that:
!Require antimicrobial therapy by any route of administration or; 
!Require any surgical intervention (eg, incision and drainage).
Treated infections will be further classified as serious or non-serious.  Serious infections are 
treated infections that:
!Require intravenous antimicrobial therapy or; 
!Required hospitalization for treatment or; 
!Meet other criteria that require the infection to be classified as a SAE.
A participant who experiences a serious infection should be discontinued from treatment.  A serious infection should be reported as a SAE and should be listed as the reason for discontinuation in the CRF.  All serious infections occurring during the study should undergo appropriate laboratory investigations, including culture, and the results (eg, any identified organisms or absence of growth) be recorded in the CRF.
For participants who experience non-serious infections that require a temporary hold on 
dosing of the study intervention during the study see Section 6.1.1.  Consultation with the 
sponsor is available.
8.2.7.1. Suspected Herpetiform Rash 
For any occurrence of a suspected herpetiform rash (eg, herpes simplex and herpes zoster),

be collected for the analysis of viral load.  Details for these collections will be provided in the laboratory manual.
8.2.8. Clinical Safety Laboratory Assessments
See Appendix 2 for the list of clinical safety laboratory tests to be performed and the 
Schedule of Activities for the timing and frequency.  The direct Coombs test sent to a local 
laboratory should only be obtained if the investigator suspects that a clinically significant 
hemolytic anemia is present that will be reflected in a BILAG score for hemolytic anemia.
The investigator must review the laboratory report, document this review, and record any 
clinically relevant changes occurring during the study in the AE section of the CRF.  Clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings are those which are not associated with the underlying disease, unless judged by the investigator to be more severe than expected for the participant's condition.
All laboratory tests with values considered clinically significantly abnormal during 
participation in the study or within 28 days after the last dose of study intervention should be repeated at the central lab until the values return to normal or baseline or are no longer considered clinically significant by the investigator or medical monitor.
If such values do not return to normal/baseline within a period of time judged reasonable by 
the investigator, the etiology should be identified and the sponsor notified.
All protocol-required laboratory assessments, as defined in Appendix 2 , must be conducted 
in accordance with the laboratory manual and the Schedule of Activities.
If laboratory values from non-protocol-specified laboratory assessments performed at the 
institution’s local laboratory require a change in participant management or are considered clinically significant by the investigator (eg, SAE or AE or dose modification), then the results must be recorded in the CRF.
8.2.9. SerumCreatinine, SerumCystatin C and Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate 
(eGFR)
Serum creatinine will be measured as part of serum chemistry at times specified in the 
Schedule of Activities section of the protocol.  Creatinine elevations above the upper limit of 
normal (ULN) will be followed until resolution or return to baseline values.  Serum 
creatinine based eGFR will be calculated.  Serum cystatin C will be measured and cystatin C 
based eGFR will be calculated at corresponding times per Schedule of Activities . 
The eGFR will be calculated using the 2 sets of equations developed by the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI), which utilize serum creatinine (SCr) and serum cystatin C (S Cystatin C) respectively (see Appendix 22 ). 090177e1a05d6b35\A pproved\A pproved On: 22-A pr-2024 15:21 (GMT )

Page 1468.2.10. Suicidal Ideation and Behavior Risk Monitoring 
The Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS; Appendix 15 ) will be used to assess 
suicidal ideation and behavior.  The C-SSRS is a validated tool to evaluate suicidal ideation 
and behavior.34
At the screening visit (baseline), if there are “yes” answers on items 4 and/or 5 in the past year, or on any question in the suicidal behavior section of the C-SSRS in the past 5 years, the participant will be excluded from the study. 
At Week 24 visit the Since Last Visit version of the C-SSRS should be utilized.  The Since 
Last Visit version refers to the participants experience since their last visit. If there are “yes” answers on items 4 and/or 5 or on any suicidal behavior question of the C-SSRS, the participant will be discontinued from treatment and referred to a mental health professional for appropriate evaluation and treatment.  If the participant cannot be seen by a mental health professional within 24 hours, then the participant should be sent to a local emergency room for psychiatric assessment.
8.2.11. Pregnancy Testing
Pregnancy tests may be urine or serum tests, but must have a sensitivity of at least 
25 mIU/mL.  Pregnancy tests will be performed in women of child bearing potential (WOCBP) at the times listed in the Schedule of Activities.  Following a negative pregnancy 
test result at screening, appropriate contraception must be commenced and a negative pregnancy test result will be required at Day 1 prior to dosing and then prior to the participant’s receiving the study treatment at all subsequent visits.  Pregnancy tests will also be done whenever 1 menstrual cycle is missed during the active treatment period (or when potential pregnancy is otherwise suspected) and at the end of the study.  Pregnancy tests may also be repeated if requested by institutional review boards (IRBs)/ethics committees (ECs) or if required by local regulations.  If a urine test cannot be confirmed as negative (eg, an ambiguous result), a serum pregnancy test is required.  In such cases, the participant must be excluded if the serum pregnancy result is positive.
8.3. Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events
The definitions of an AE and an SAE can be found in Appendix 3 . 
AEs will be reported by the participant (or, when appropriate, by a caregiver, surrogate, or 
the participant's legally authorized representative).
The investigator and any qualified designees are responsible for detecting, documenting, and 
recording events that meet the definition of an AE or SAE and remain responsible to pursue and obtain adequate information both to determine the outcome and to assess whether it meets the criteria for classification as an SAE or that caused the participant to discontinue the study (see Section 7 ).
In addition, the investigator may be requested by Pfizer Safety to obtain specific follow-up information in an expedited fashion.090177e1a05d6b35\A pproved\A pproved On: 22-A pr-2024 15:21 (GMT )

or SAEs
Not applicable.
8.3.2. Time Period and Frequency for Collecting AE and SAE Information
The time period for actively eliciting and collecting AEs and SAEs (“active collection 
period”) for each participant begins from the time the participant provides informed consent, which is obtained before the participant’s participation in the study (ie, before undergoing any study-related procedure and/or receiving study intervention), through and including a minimum of 28 calendar days, except as indicated below, after the last administration of the study intervention.
For participants who are screen failures, the active collection period ends when screen failure 
status is determined.
If the participant withdraws from the study and also withdraws consent for the collection of 
future information, the active collection period ends when consent is withdrawn.
If a participant definitively discontinues or temporarily discontinues study intervention 
because of an AE or SAE, the AE or SAE must be recorded on the CRF and the SAE reported using the CT SAE Report Form.
Follow-up by the investigator continues throughout and after the active collection period and 
until the event or its sequelae resolve or stabilize at a level acceptable to the investigator.
Investigators are not obligated to actively seek AEs or SAEs after conclusion of the study 
participation.  However, if the investigator learns of any SAE, including a death, at any time after a participant has been discharged from the study, and he/she considers the event to be reasonably related to the study intervention or study participation, the investigator must promptly report the SAE to Pfizer using the CT SAE Report Form.
8.3.2.1. Reporting SAEs to Pfizer Safety
All SAEs occurring in a participant during the active collection period are reported to Pfizer 
Safety on the CT SAE Report Form immediately and under no circumstance should this exceed 24 hours, as indicated in Appendix 3 .  The investigator will submit any updated SAE 
data to the sponsor within 24 hours of it being available.
SAEs occurring in a participant after the active collection period has ended are reported to 
Pfizer Safety if the investigator becomes aware of them; at a minimum, all SAEs that the 
investigator believes have at least a reasonable possibility of being related to study intervention must be reported to Pfizer Safety.090177e1a05d6b35\A pproved\A pproved On: 22-A pr-2024 15:21 (GMT )

All nonserious AEs and SAEs occurring in a participant during the active collection period, 
which begins after obtaining informed consent as described in Section 8.3.1 , will be recorded 
on the AE section of the CRF.  
The investigator is to record on the CRF all directly observed and all spontaneously reported 
AEs and SAEs reported by the participant.
8.3.3. Method of Detecting AEs and SAEs
The method of recording, evaluating, and assessing causality of AEs and SAEs and the 
procedures for completing and transmitting SAE reports are provided in Appendix 3 .
Care will be taken not to introduce bias when detecting AEs and/or SAEs.  Open-ended and nonleading verbal questioning of the participant is the preferred method to inquire about AE occurrences.
8.3.4. Follow-up of AEs and SAEs
After the initial AE/SAE report, the investigator is required to proactively follow each 
participant at subsequent visits/contacts.  For each event, the investigator must pursue and obtain adequate information until resolution, stabilization, the event is otherwise explained, or the participant is lost to follow-up (as defined in Section 7.3 ).
In general, follow-up information will include a description of the event in sufficient detail to allow for a complete medical assessment of the case and independent determination of possible causality.  Any information relevant to the event, such as concomitant medications and illnesses, must be provided.  In the case of a participant death, a summary of available autopsy findings must be submitted as soon as possible to Pfizer Safety. 
Further information on follow-up procedures is given in Appendix 3 .
8.3.5. Regulatory Reporting Requirements for SAEs
Prompt notification by the investigator to the sponsor of an SAE is essential so that legal 
obligations and ethical responsibilities towards the safety of participants and the safety of astudy intervention under clinical investigation are met.
The sponsor has a legal responsibility to notify both the local regulatory authority and other 
regulatory agencies about the safety of a study intervention under clinical investigation.  The sponsor will comply with country-specific regulatory requirements relating to safety 
reporting to the regulatory authority, institutional review boards (IRBs)/ethics committees 
(ECs), and investigators.
Investigator safety reports must be prepared for suspected unexpected serious adverse 
reactions (SUSARs) according to local regulatory requirements and sponsor policy and forwarded to investigators as necessary.090177e1a05d6b35\A pproved\A pproved On: 22-A pr-2024 15:21 (GMT )

specific safety information (eg, summary or listing of SAEs) from the sponsor will review and then file it along with the investigator’s brochure and will notify the IRB/EC, if appropriate according to local requirements.
8.3.6. Exposure During Pregnancy or Breastfeeding, and Occupational Exposure
Exposure to the study intervention under study during pregnancy or breastfeeding and 
occupational exposure are reportable to Pfizer Safety within 24 hours of investigator awareness.
8.3.6.1. Exposure During Pregnancy
Details of all pregnancies in female participants and, if indicated, female partners of male 
participants will be collected after the start of study intervention and until 30 days after the last dose.
If a pregnancy is reported, the investigator should inform the sponsor within 24 hours of 
learning of the pregnancy and should follow the procedures outlined in Appendix 4 .
Abnormal pregnancy outcomes (eg, spontaneous abortion, fetal death, stillbirth, congenital anomalies, ectopic pregnancy) are considered SAEs.
8.3.6.2. Exposure During Breastfeeding
Scenarios of exposure during breastfeeding must be reported, irrespective of the presence of 
an associated SAE, to Pfizer Safety within 24 hours of the investigator’s awareness, using the CT SAE Report Form.  An exposure during breastfeeding report is not created when a Pfizer drug specifically approved for use in breastfeeding women (eg, vitamins) is administered in accord with authorized use.  However, if the infant experiences an SAE associated with sucha drug’s administration, the SAE is reported together with the exposure during breastfeeding.
8.3.6.3. Occupational Exposure
An occupational exposure occurs when, during the performance of job duties, a person 
(whether a healthcare professional or otherwise) gets in unplanned direct contact with the product, which may or may not lead to the occurrence of an AE.
An occupational exposure is reported to Pfizer Safety within 24 hours of the investigator’s 
awareness, using the CT SAE Report Form, regardless of whether there is an associated SAE.  Since the information does not pertain to a participant enrolled in the study, the 
information is not recorded on a CRF; however, a copy of the completed CT SAE Report 
Form is maintained in the investigator site file.
8.3.7. Cardiovascular and Death Events
Cardiovascular events will be reviewed as part of the regular safety review by the eDMC (see

For this study, any dose of study intervention greater than that prescribed for the participant 
within a 24-hour time period will be considered an overdose.
Sponsor does not recommend specific treatment for an overdose.  In the event of an overdose, the investigator/treating physician should:
1. Contact the medical monitor within 24 hours.2. Closely monitor the participant for any AEs/SAEs and laboratory abnormalities until 
study intervention can no longer be detected systemically (at least 10 days).
3. Obtain a blood sample for pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis within 2 days from the date 
of the last dose of study intervention if requested by the medical monitor (determined 
on a case-by-case basis).
4. Document the quantity of the excess dose as well as the duration of the overdose in 
the CRF.
5. Overdose is reportable to Safety only when associated with an SAE.
Decisions regarding dose interruptions or modifications will be made by the investigator in consultation with the medical monitor based on the clinical evaluation of the participant.

9. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS
Detailed methodology for summary and statistical analyses of the data collected in this study 
is outlined here and further detailed in a statistical analysis plan (SAP), which will be maintained by the sponsor.  The SAP may modify what is outlined in the protocol where appropriate; however, any major modifications of the primary endpoint definitions or their analyses will also be reflected in a protocol amendment.
9.1. Estimands and Statistical Hypotheses
9.1.1. EstimandsThe primary estimand for the primary endpoint of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Responder 
Index (SRI-4) response at Week 52 will be the population average treatment difference between PF-06700841 and placebo in the proportion of participants with active SLE who achieved the SRI-4 endpoint at Week 52 and did not discontinue study intervention prior to 090177e1a05d6b35\A pproved\A pproved On: 22-A pr-2024 15:21 (GMT )CCI

PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL 
Page 156Week 52. SRI-4 response is a composite endpoint where a responder must meet criteria in 
the assessment of SLEDAI-2K, BILAG and PhGA. Data post intercurrent events will be censored and any participant who experienced these intercurrent events will be considered as a non-responder at Week 52. The population-level summary will be the differences in the proportions of SRI-4 responders at Week 52 between each treatment dose arm of PF-06700841 and the placebo arm. For the primary endpoint, a treatment policy estimand will also be included in the SAP as a secondary estimand to estimate the treatment difference in the SRI-4 response rate at Week 52 regardless of occurrence of any intercurrent events prior to Week 52.  Additional sensitivity analyses involving the primary endpoint may be specified within the SAP.
Estimands are also defined corresponding to secondary objectives.  In general, population 
will consist of participants with active SLE as defined by inclusion/exclusion criteria except those estimands for a subgroup of participants.  Intercurrent events for secondary binary and continuous endpoints are defined similar to those events for the primary endpoint. For each binary endpoint, the main estimand is similarly defined as a composite estimand and any participant who experienced the specified intercurrent events will be considered as a non--responder; for each continuous endpoint the main estimand will be a hypothetical estimand and only data collected prior to the occurrence of intercurrent events will be included for analyses. Treatment policy estimand may be defined in the SAP for selected secondary endpoints. 
Participants who had data missing due to COVID-19 or Russia-Ukraine conflict at Week 52 
visit will be removed from analysis for that visit (eg, not included into numerator and denominator in the calculation of proportion of responders at the visit where the data are missing due to COVID-19 or Russia-Ukraine conflict). 
9.1.2. Hypotheses and Decision Rules
Each of the 3 dose groups of the PF-06700841 will be compared with the placebo group for 
both the primary endpoint of SRI-4 response at Week 52 and the key secondary endpoint of the BICLA response at Week 52 in 6 hypotheses.  Two families (FA and FB) of hypotheses are formed from these 6 hypotheses (Table 4).  In order to control the overall family-wise type-I error rate, a sequentially rejective closed testing procedure is defined.  The family FA 
serves as the gatekeeper before testing hypotheses in the family FB.  The hypotheses in the 
family FB will not be formally tested unless all null hypotheses in the family FA are rejected.  Additional details, including any future changes regarding the multiplicity control of the primary and key secondary endpoints at the overall family-wise type-I error rate of one-sided 0.025, will be handled within the SAP.

9.2. Sample Size Determination
The study randomized 350 participants in a 1:2:2:2 allocation ratio in the order of PF-
06700841 15 mg, 30 mg, and 45 mg, and placebo arms. The primary endpoint of this study is the proportion of participants achieving SRI-4 response at Week 52. Using a Cochran-Maentel-Haenszel test, a placebo SRI-4 response rate of 40% at Week 52 and the true effect of treatment with PF-06700841 45 mg on SRI-4 response rate of 65% at Week 52, an overall 
type-I family-wise error %=0.025 (one-sided), and N=95 evaluable participants in both arms
to account for potential loss of participants impacted by either the COVID-19 or Russia-
Ukraine crises, we expect to have at least 88% power to reject the null hypothesis in HvP1. Using the same parameters and assuming a placebo BICLA response rate of 30% at Week 52 and the true effect of treatment with PF-06700841 45 mg on BICLA response rate of 47.5% at Week 52, we expect to have at least 58% power to reject the null hypothesis in HvP2. The calculation on sample size for key secondary endpoint assume primary endpoint hypotheses that were higher up in the testing hierarchy in Figure 1 were tested and rejected

9.4. Statistical Analyses
The SAP will be developed and finalized before database lock and will describe the 
participant populations to be included in the analyses, and procedures for accounting for missing, unused, and spurious data.  This section is a summary of the planned statistical analyses of the primary and secondary endpoints.
9.4.1. Efficacy Analyses
Continuous variables will be summarized by N, mean, median, standard deviation, minimum 
and maximum.  Categorical variables will be summarized by count and percent of participants in each group.  All summaries will be split by treatment group.  Efficacy data will be listed, tabulated and summarized graphically, as appropriate.  Model assumptions will be tested using appropriate statistical or graphical techniques.   
If statistical hypothesis testing is performed, tests will be conducted at the % =0.025 
(one-sided) level.  Analysis results will include the estimated effect and 95% confidence 
intervals.  
The primary population of interest for efficacy analysis is the Full Analysis Set (FAS) which 
will include all randomized participants who have received at least 1 dose of study intervention.  Additional analysis populations may be defined in the SAP.
The final analyses will be performed when all participants complete Week 52.  Further details of analyses in efficacy will be specified in the statistical analysis plan. 9.4.2. Analysis of the Primary Endpoint
The primary endpoint is the proportion of SRI-4 responders at Week 52 and the primary 
analysis of this endpoint will be based on the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) approach 090177e1a05d6b35\A pproved\A pproved On: 22-A pr-2024 15:21 (GMT )CCI

the p-values for pairwise treatment between each dose group of PF-06700841 and the placebo group.  Treatment difference in the proportion of responders for the active treatment groups compared to the placebo will be estimated based on the CMH approach.  These estimates will be reported with 95% confidence intervals and one-sided p-values. A supplementary analysis using a generalized linear marginal model for repeated measures (GLMMRM) will be performed for the longitudinal SRI-4 endpoint data. This model will include treatment, visit, treatment by visit interaction as fixed effects.  A common AR(1) variance-covariance matrix for all treatment groups will be used to model the variability among longitudinal observations within a participant.  If there are any concerns with model convergence, covariance structures of co mpound symmetry w ill be attempted. Unlike the 
non-responder imputation for missing data in the primary analysis, missing at random is assumed for missing data in the GLMMRM analysis. Details will be provided in the SAP.  
 
9.4.3. Analysis of Secondary Endpoints
9.4.3.1. Analysis of Key Secondary EndpointThe key secondary endpoint is the proportion of BICLA responders at Week 52 and the 
primary analysis of this endpoint will be conducted in the manner described above for the primary endpoint using the CMH approach adjusting for stratification factors.  The hypothesis testing of this endpoint will be based on the p-values for pairwise treatment comparisons between each dose group of PF-06700841 and the placebo group.  Treatment difference in the proportion of responders for the active treatment compared to the placebo will be estimated based on the CMH approach.  These estimates will be reported with 95% confidence intervals and one-sided p-values.
9.4.3.2. Analysis of Other Secondary Endpoints
The proportion of participants achieving LLDAS, oral corticosteroid reductions, and SRI-4 
response with sustained reduction of oral corticosteroids will be estimated using similar methods for the SRI-4 responder analysis.
A linear mixed model will be used to analyze the continuous longitudinal response of 
CLASI-A, FACIT-F and LupusQoL.  This linear mixed model will include fixed effects for 
treatment, week, treatment by week interaction, and the stratification factors.  Other covariates may be included in the analysis if deemed appropriate.  Participant variable will be modeled as a random effect with an unstructured covariance.  Further details regarding imputation methods for missing data and any sensitivity analyses will be provided in the SAP.
Occurrence of severe flares will be analyzed as a time to event endpoint.  Time to first severe 
flare will be tested to compare treatment groups with placebo based on a log-rank test with estimates from the Kaplan-Meier product-limit method.  The corresponding Kaplan-Meier plot will also be used to visualize differences in the incidence of flares over time.  The hazard 090177e1a05d6b35\A pproved\A pproved On: 22-A pr-2024 15:21 (GMT )CCI

The safety analysis will include all participants who have received at least one dose of study 
drug or placebo.  Safety data will be presented in tabular and/or graphical format and summarized descriptively, where appropriate.  All safety endpoints will be listed and 
summarized in accordance with Pfizer Data Standards.  Categorical outcomes (eg, AEs) will 
be summarized by participant counts and percentage.  Continuous outcome (eg, BP, heart rate, ECG intervals, etc) will be summarized using N, mean, median, standard deviation, etc.  Laboratory data, ECG intervals and vital signs crossing the thresholds of clinical concern will be tabulated according to sponsor Data Standards.  Participant listings will be produced for these safety endpoints accordingly.
Data relevant to the assessment of suicidality will be mapped to the Columbia-Classification 
Algorithm of Suicide Assessment (C-CASA) codes.  Baseline  C-SSRS data 
(mapped to C-CASA scores) will be summarized descriptively by treatment group at baseline

Source documents provide evidence for the existence of the participant and substantiate the 
integrity of the data collected.  Source documents are filed at the investigator site.
Data reported on the CRF or entered in the electronic CRF (eCRF) that are transcribed from 
source documents must be consistent with the source documents or the discrepancies must be explained.  The investigator may need to request previous medical records or transfer records, depending on the study.  Also, current medical records must be available.
Definition of what constitutes source data can be found in the study completion guidelines. 10.1.8. Study and Site Closure
The sponsor designee reserves the right to close the study site or terminate the study at any 
time for any reason at the sole discretion of the sponsor. Study sites will be closed upon study completion.  A study site is considered closed when all required documents and study supplies have been collected and a study-site closure visit has been performed.
The investigator may initiate study-site closure at any time upon notification to the contract 
research organization (CRO) if requested to do so by the responsible IRB/EC or if such termination is required to protect the health of study participants.
Reasons for the early closure of a study site by the sponsor may include but are not limited 
to:
!Failure of the investigator to comply with the protocol, the requirements of the IRB/EC or local health authorities, the sponsor's procedures, or GCP guidelines;
!Inadequate recruitment of participants by the investigator;
Discontinuation of further study intervention development. Study termination is also provided for in the clinical study agreement.  If there is any conflict between the contract and this protocol, the contract will control as to termination rights.

understanding of the study results.
For all publications relating to the study, the investigator will comply with recognized ethical 
standards concerning publications and authorship, including those established by the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors.
The sponsor will comply with the requirements for publication of the overall study results 
covering all investigator sites.  In accordance with standard editorial and ethical practice, the sponsor will support publication of multicenter studies only in their entirety and not as individual site data.  In this case, a coordinating investigator will be designated by mutual agreement.
Authorship of publications for the overall study results will be determined by mutual 
agreement and in line with International Committee of Medical Journal Editors authorship requirements. 
If publication is addressed in the clinical study agreement, the publication policy set out in 
this section will not apply.
10.1.10. Sponsor’s Qualified Medical Personnel
The contact information for the sponsor's appropriately qualified medical personnel for the 
study is documented in the study contact list located in the supporting study documentation/team SharePoint site/study portal/clinical trial management system (CTMS)/study team on demand (SToD) system.  
To facilitate access to appropriately qualified medical personnel on study-related medical 
questions or problems, participants are provided with a contact card.  The contact card contains, at a minimum, protocol and study intervention identifiers, participant numbers, contact information for the investigator site, and contact details for a contact center in the event that the investigator site staff cannot be reached to provide advice on a medical question or problem originating from another healthcare professional not involved in the participant’s participation in the study.  The contact number can also be used by investigator staff if they are seeking advice on medical questions or problems; however, it should be used only in the event that the established communication pathways between the investigator site and the study team are not available.  It is therefore intended to augment, but not replace, the 
established communication pathways between the investigator site and the study team for 
advice on medical questions or problems that may arise during the study.  The contact number is not intended for use by the participant directly, and if a participant calls that number, he or she will be directed back to the investigator site.090177e1a05d6b35\A pproved\A pproved On: 22-A pr-2024 15:21 (GMT )

Page 17310.3. Appendix 3: Adverse Events: Definitions and Procedures for Recording, 
Evaluating, Follow-up, and Reporting
10.3.1. Definition of AE
AE Definition
!An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical study participant, 
temporally associated with the use of study intervention, whether or not considered related to the study intervention.
NOTE: An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of study intervention.
Events Meetingthe AE Definition
!Any abnormal laboratory test results (hematology, clinical chemistry, or urinalysis) or other safety assessments (eg, ECG, radiological scans, vital sign measurements), including those that worsen from baseline, considered clinically significant in the medical and scientific judgment of the investigator (ie, not related to progression of underlying disease).
!Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent preexisting condition including either an increase in frequency and/or intensity of the condition.
!New conditions detected or diagnosed after study intervention administration even though it may have been present before the start of the study.
!Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected drug-drug interaction.
!Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study intervention or a concomitant medication.  Overdose per se will not be reported as an AE/SAE unless it is an intentional overdose taken with possible suicidal/self-harming intent.  Such overdoses should be reported regardless of sequelae.
!“Lack of efficacy” or “failure of expected pharmacological action” per se will not be reported as an AE or SAE.  Such instances will be captured in the efficacy assessments.  However, the signs, symptoms, and/or clinical sequelae resulting from lack of efficacy will be reported as an AE or SAE if they fulfill the definition of an AE or SAE.090177e1a05d6b35\A pproved\A pproved On: 22-A pr-2024 15:21 (GMT )

Page 174Events NOT Meeting the AE Definition
!Any clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings or other abnormal safety 
assessments which are associated with the underlying disease, unless judged by the investigator to be more severe than expected for the participant’s condition.
!The disease/disorder being studied or expected progression, signs, or symptoms of the disease/disorder being studied, unless more severe than expected for the participant’s condition.
!Medical or surgical procedure (eg, endoscopy, appendectomy): the condition that 
leads to the procedure is the AE.
!Situations in which an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or 
convenience admission to a hospital).
!Anticipated day-to-day fluctuations of preexisting disease(s) or condition(s) present or detected at the start of the study that do not worsen.
10.3.2. Definition of SAE
If an event is not an AE per definition above, then it cannot be an SAE even if serious 
conditions are met (eg, hospitalization for signs/symptoms of the disease under study, death due to progression of disease).
An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose:
a. Results in death
b. Is life-threatening
The term “life-threatening” in the definition of “serious” refers to an event in which the 
participant was at risk of death at the time of the event.  It does not refer to an event that hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe.
c. Requires inpatienthospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization
In general, hospitalization signifies that the participant has been detained (usually 
involving at least an overnight stay) at the hospital or emergency ward for observation and/or treatment that would not have been appropriate in the physician’s office or outpatient setting.  Complications that occur during hospitalization are AEs.  If a complication prolongs hospitalization or fulfills any other serious criteria, the event is serious.  When in doubt as to whether “hospitalization” occurred or was necessary, the AE should be considered serious.
Hospitalization for elective treatment of a preexisting condition that did not worsen from 
baseline is not considered an AE.090177e1a05d6b35\A pproved\A pproved On: 22-A pr-2024 15:21 (GMT )

Page 175d. Results in persistent disability/incapacity
!The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct 
normal life functions.
!This definition is not intended to include experiences of relatively minor medical significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and accidental trauma (eg, sprained ankle) which may interfere with or prevent everyday life functions but do not constitute a substantial disruption.
e. Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect
f. Other situations:
!Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether SAE reporting is appropriate in other situations such as important medical events that may not be immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the participant or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the above definition.  These events should usually be considered serious.
!Examples of such events include invasive or malignant cancers, intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization, or development of drug dependency or drug abuse.
10.3.3. Recording/Reporting and Follow-up of AEs and/or SAEs
AE and SAE Recording/Reporting
The table below summarizes the requirements for recording adverse events on the CRF and for reporting serious adverse events on the Clinical Trial (CT) Serious Adverse Event (SAE) Report Form to Pfizer Safety.  These requirements are delineated for 3 types of events: (1) SAEs; (2) nonserious adverse events (AEs); and (3) exposure to the study intervention under study during pregnancy or breastfeeding, and occupational exposure. 
It should be noted that the CT SAE Report Form for reporting of SAE information is not 
the same as the AE page of the CRF.  When the same data are collected, the forms must be completed in a consistent manner.  AEs should be recorded using concise medical terminology and the same AE term should be used on both the CRF and the CT SAE Report Form for reporting of SAE information.090177e1a05d6b35\A pproved\A pproved On: 22-A pr-2024 15:21 (GMT )

documentation (eg, hospital progress notes, laboratory reports, and diagnostic 
reports) related to the event.
!The investigator will then record all relevant AE/SAE information in the CRF.
!It isnotacceptable for the investigator to send photocopies of the participant’s 
medical records to Pfizer Safety in lieu of completion of the CT SAE Report Form/AE/SAE CRF page.
!There may be instances when copies of medical records for certain cases are requested by Pfizer Safety.  In this case, all participant identifiers, with the exception of the participant number, will be redacted on the copies of the medical records before submission to Pfizer Safety.
!The investigator will attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on signs, symptoms, and/or other clinical information.  Whenever possible, the diagnosis (not the individual signs/symptoms) will be documented as the AE/SAE.
Assessment of Intensity
The investigator will make an assessment of intensity for each AE and SAE reported during the study and assign it to 1 of the following categories: 
!Mild: An event that is easily tolerated by the participant, causing minimal discomfort and not interfering with everyday activities.
!Moderate: An event that causes sufficient discomfort and interferes with normal everyday activities.090177e1a05d6b35\A pproved\A pproved On: 22-A pr-2024 15:21 (GMT )

Page 177!Severe: An event that prevents normal everyday activities.  An AE that is assessed 
as severe should not be confused with an SAE.  Severe is a category utilized for rating the intensity of an event; and both AEs and SAEs can be assessed as severe.
!An event is defined as “serious” when it meets at least 1 of the predefined outcomes as described in the definition of an SAE, NOT when it is rated as severe.
Assessment of Causality
!The investigator is obligated to assess the relationship between study intervention and each occurrence of each AE/SAE.
!A “reasonable possibility” of a relationship conveys that there are facts, evidence, and/or arguments to suggest a causal relationship, rather than a relationship cannot be ruled out.
!The investigator will use clinical judgment to determine the relationship.
!Alternative causes, such as underlying disease(s), concomitant therapy, and other risk factors, as well as the temporal relationship of the event to study intervention administration will be considered and investigated.
!The investigator will also consult the investigator’s brochure (IB) and/or product information, for marketed products, in his/her assessment.
!For each AE/SAE, the investigator must document in the medical notes that he/she 
has reviewed the AE/SAE and has provided an assessment of causality.
!There may be situations in which an SAE has occurred and the investigator has minimal information to include in the initial report to the sponsor.  However, it is 
very important that the investigator always make an assessment of causality for every event before the initial transmission of the SAE data to the sponsor.
!The investigator may change his/her opinion of causality in light of follow-up information and send an SAE follow-up report with the updated causality assessment.
!The causality assessment is one of the criteria used when determining regulatory reporting requirements.
!If the investigator does not know whether or not the study intervention caused the event, then the event will be handled as “related to study intervention” for reporting purposes, as defined by the sponsor.  In addition, if the investigator determines thatan SAE is associated with study procedures, the investigator must record this causal relationship in the source documents and CRF, and report such an 090177e1a05d6b35\A pproved\A pproved On: 22-A pr-2024 15:21 (GMT )

Follow-up of AEs and SAEs
!The investigator is obligated to perform or arrange for the conduct of supplemental measurements and/or evaluations as medically indicated or as requested by the sponsor to elucidate the nature and/or causality of the AE or SAE as fully as possible.  This may include additional laboratory tests or investigations, histopathological examinations, or consultation with other healthcare professionals.
!If a participant dies during participation in the study or during a recognized 
follow-up period, the investigator will provide Pfizer Safety with a copy of any 
postmortem findings including histopathology.
!New or updated information will be recorded in the originally completed CRF.
!The investigator will submit any updated SAE data to the sponsor within 24 hours of receipt of the information.
10.3.4. Reporting of SAEs
SAE Reporting to Pfizer Safety via an Electronic Data Collection Tool
!The primary mechanism for reporting an SAE to Pfizer Safety will be the electronic 
data collection tool.
!If the electronic system is unavailable, then the site will use the paper SAE data 
collection tool (see next section) in order to report the event within 24 hours.
!The site will enter the SAE data into the electronic system as soon as the data become available.
!After the study is completed at a given site, the electronic data collection tool will be taken off-line to prevent the entry of new data or changes to existing data.
!If a site receives a report of a new SAE from a study participant or receives updated data on a previously reported SAE after the electronic data collection tool has been taken off-line, then the site can report this information on a paper SAE form (see next section) or to Pfizer Safety by telephone.090177e1a05d6b35\A pproved\A pproved On: 22-A pr-2024 15:21 (GMT )

10.4.1. Male ParticipantsNo contraception methods are required for male participants in this study, as the calculated 
safety margin is ≥ 100-fold between the estimated maternal exposure due to seminal transfer 
and the NOAEL for serious manifestations of developmental toxicity in nonclinical studies.
10.4.2. Female Participant Reproductive Inclusion Criteria
A female participant is eligible to participate if she is not pregnant or breastfeeding, and at 
least 1 of the following conditions applies:
!Is not a WOCBP (see definitions below in Section 10.4.3).
OR
!Is a WOCBP and using a contraceptive method that is highly effective (with a failure 
rate of <1% per year), as described below during the intervention period and for at least 28 days after the last dose of study intervention, which corresponds to the time needed to eliminate any study intervention(s).  The investigator should evaluate the effectiveness of the contraceptive method in relationship to the first dose of study intervention. 
The investigator is responsible for review of medical history, menstrual history, and recent sexual activity to decrease the risk for inclusion of a woman with an early undetected pregnancy. 
10.4.3. Woman of Childbearing Potential (WOCBP)
A woman is considered fertile following menarche and until becoming postmenopausal 
unless permanently sterile (see below).
If fertility is unclear (eg, amenorrhea in adolescents or athletes) and a menstrual cycle cannot 
be confirmed before the first dose of study intervention, additional evaluation should be considered.
Women in the following categories are not considered WOCBP:
1. Premenopausal female with 1 of the following:
!Documented hysterectomy;
!Documented bilateral salpingectomy;
!Documented bilateral oophorectomy.090177e1a05d6b35\A pproved\A pproved On: 22-A pr-2024 15:21 (GMT )

above, (eg, mullerian agenesis, androgen insensitivity), investigator discretion should be applied to determining study entry.
Note: Documentation for any of the above categories can come from the site personnel’s 
review of the participant’s medical records, medical examination, or medical history interview.  The method of documentation should be recorded in the participant’s medical record for the study.
2. Postmenopausal female:
!A postmenopausal state is defined as age 60 years or older or no menses for 12 months without an alternative medical cause.
!A high follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) level in the postmenopausal range may be used to confirm a postmenopausal state in women not using hormonal contraception or hormone replacement therapy (HRT). 
!Females on HRT and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one of the nonestrogen hormonal highly effective contraception methods if they wish to continue their HRT during the study.  Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of postmenopausal status before study enrollment.
10.4.4. Contraception Methods
Highly Effective MethodsThat Have Low User Dependency

!An example of environmental exposure would be a case involving direct contact 
with a Pfizer product in a pregnant woman (eg, a nurse reports that she is pregnant and has been exposed to chemotherapeutic products).
!A male has been exposed (eg, because of treatment or environmental exposure) to the study intervention prior to or around the time of conception and/or is exposed during his partner’s pregnancy.
If a participant or participant’s partner becomes or is found to be pregnant during the participant’s treatment with the study intervention, the investigator must report this 090177e1a05d6b35\A pproved\A pproved On: 22-A pr-2024 15:21 (GMT )

Page 183information to Pfizer Safety on the CT SAE Report Form and an EDP supplemental form, 
regardless of whether an SAE has occurred.  In addition, the investigator must submit information regarding environmental exposure to a Pfizer product in a pregnant woman (eg, a participant reports that she is pregnant and has been exposed to a cytotoxic product by inhalation or spillage) to Pfizer Safety using the EDP supplemental form.  This must be done irrespective of whether an AE has occurred and within 24 hours of awareness of the exposure.  The information submitted should include the anticipated date of delivery (see below for information related to termination of pregnancy).
Follow-up is conducted to obtain general information on the pregnancy and its outcome for 
all EDP reports with an unknown outcome.  The investigator will follow the pregnancy until completion (or until pregnancy termination) and notify Pfizer Safety of the outcome as a follow-up to the initial EDP supplemental form.  In the case of a live birth, the structural integrity of the neonate can be assessed at the time of birth.  In the event of a termination, the reason(s) for termination should be specified and, if clinically possible, the structural integrity of the terminated fetus should be assessed by gross visual inspection (unless preprocedure test findings are conclusive for a congenital anomaly and the findings are reported).
If the outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for an SAE (ie, ectopic pregnancy, 
spontaneous abortion, intrauterine fetal demise, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly [in a live-born baby, a terminated fetus, an intrauterine fetal demise, or a neonatal death]), the investigator should follow the procedures for reporting SAEs.
Additional information about pregnancy outcomes that are reported to Pfizer Safety as SAEs 
follows: 
!Spontaneous abortion includes miscarriage and missed abortion;
!Neonatal deaths that occur within 1 month of birth should be reported, without regard to causality, as SAEs.  In addition, infant deaths after 1 month should be reported as SAEs when the investigator assesses the infant death as related or possibly related to exposure to the study intervention. 
Additional information regarding the EDP may be requested by the sponsor.  Further follow-up of birth outcomes will be handled on a case-by-case basis (eg, follow-up on preterm infants to identify developmental delays).  In the case of paternal exposure, the investigator will provide the participant with the Pregnant Partner Release of Information Form to deliver to his partner.  The investigator must document in the source documents that the participant was given the Pregnant Partner Release of Information Form to provide to his partner.090177e1a05d6b35\A pproved\A pproved On: 22-A pr-2024 15:21 (GMT )

Page 18510.6. Appendix 6: Liver Safety: Suggested Actions and Follow-up Assessments
Potential Cases of Drug-Induced Liver Injury
Humans exposed to a drug who show no sign of liver injury (as determined by elevations in 
transaminases) are termed “tolerators,” while those who show transient liver injury, but adapt are termed “adaptors.”  In some participants, transaminase elevations are a harbinger of a more serious potential outcome.  These participants fail to adapt and therefore are "susceptible" to progressive and serious liver injury, commonly referred to as drug-induced liver injury (DILI).  Participants who experience a transaminase elevation above 3 times the upper limit of normal (
×ULN) should be monitored more frequently to determine if they are 
an “adaptor” or are “susceptible.”
In the majority of DILI cases, elevations in aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and/or alanine 
aminotransferase (ALT) precede total bilirubin (TBili) elevations (>2 ×ULN) by several 
days or weeks.  The increase in TBili typically occurs while AST/ALT is/are still elevated above 3 
×ULN (ie, AST/ALT and TBili values will be elevated within the same laboratory 
sample).  In rare instances, by the time TBili elevations are detected, AST/ALT values might have decreased.  This occurrence is still regarded as a potential DILI.  Therefore, abnormal elevations in either AST OR ALT in addition to TBili that meet the criteria outlined below are considered potential DILI (assessed per Hy’s law criteria) cases and should always be considered important medical events, even before all other possible causes of liver injury have been excluded.
The threshold of laboratory abnormalities for a potential DILI case depends on the 
participant’s individual baseline values and underlying conditions.  Participants who present with the following laboratory abnormalities should be evaluated further as potential DILI (Hy’s law) cases to definitively determine the etiology of the abnormal laboratory values:
!Participants with AST/ALT and TBili baseline values within the normal range who subsequently present with AST OR ALT values >3 
×ULN AND a TBili value 
>2 × ULN with no evidence of hemolysis and an alkaline phosphatase value <2
×ULN or not available.
!For participants with baseline AST OR ALT ORTBili values above the ULN, the 
following threshold values are used in the definition mentioned above, as needed, depending on which values are above the ULN at baseline:
!Preexisting AST or ALT baseline values above the normal range: AST or ALT 
values >2 times the baseline values AND >3 
×ULN; or >8 ×ULN (whichever is 
smaller).
!Preexisting values of TBili above the normal range: TBili level increased from baseline value by an amount of at least 1 × ULN orif the value reaches 
>3 × ULN (whichever is smaller).090177e1a05d6b35\A pproved\A pproved On: 22-A pr-2024 15:21 (GMT )

Hy’s law, additional laboratory tests should include albumin, creatine kinase (CK), direct and indirect bilirubin, gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), prothrombin time (PT)/international normalized ratio (INR), total bile acids, and alkaline phosphatase.  Consideration should also be given to drawing a separate tube of clotted blood and an anticoagulated tube of blood for further testing, as needed, for further contemporaneous analyses at the time of the recognized initial abnormalities to determine etiology.  A detailed history, including relevant information, such as review of ethanol, acetaminophen (either by itself or as a coformulated product in prescription or over-the-counter medications), recreational drug, supplement (herbal) use and consumption, family history, sexual history, travel history, history of contact with a jaundiced person, surgery, blood transfusion, history of liver or allergic disease, and potential occupational exposure to chemicals, should be collected.  Further testing for acute hepatitis A, B, C, D, and E infection and liver imaging (eg, biliary tract) and collection of serum sample for acetaminophen drug and/or protein adduct levels may be warranted. 
All cases demonstrated on repeat testing as meeting the laboratory criteria of AST/ALT and 
TBili elevation defined above should be considered potential DILI (Hy’s law) cases if no other reason for the liver function test (LFT) abnormalities has yet been found.  Such 
potential DILI (Hy’s law) cases are to be reported as SAEs, irrespective of availability of all the results of the investigations performed to determine etiology of the LFT abnormalities.
A potential DILI (Hy’s law) case becomes a confirmed case only after all results of 
reasonable investigations have been received and have excluded an alternative etiology.090177e1a05d6b35\A pproved\A pproved On: 22-A pr-2024 15:21 (GMT )

These guidelines for participant safety monitoring and discontinuation are to be applied to all 
participants in study B7931028.  Additional individual participant monitoring is at the discretion of the investigator and dependent on any perceived safety concerns.  Unscheduled clinical labs may be obtained at any time during the study to assess such concerns, and a participant may be withdrawn at any time at the discretion of the investigator.  If it is not possible for a participant to return to a site for a repeat labs prior to the next scheduled visit, the investigator should note this in the source document. For participants who have a history of known intermittent out of range laboratory assessments, repeat assessments between scheduled visits may be waived by the Pfizer Clinical team following discussion with the principal investigator.
10.17.1. Safety Monitoring
! The following laboratory abnormalities require re-testing within 1 week:
!Neutrophil counts <1000 neutrophils/mm
3;
!Lymphocyte counts <500 lymphocytes/mm3;
!Platelet counts <50,000 platelets/mm3;
!eGFR that is 40% or greater reduction from baseline,
!UPCR >3 mg/mg
!Any single AST and/or ALT elevation ≥3 times the upper limit of normal (repeat 
laboratory testing should include albumin, creatine kinase, total bilirubin, direct and 
indirect bilirubin, GGT, PT [prothrombin time] with INR [international normalized ratio], and alkaline phosphatase), regardless of the total bilirubin.  (Please note that 3 times the upper limit of normal increases in ALT, AST need confirmation on separate blood draw before undertaking thorough evaluation for liver injury);
!Any single hemoglobin value <8.0 g/dL or one that drops 2 gm/dL below baseline;
!For women of child-bearing potential with any positive urine beta-human chorionic 
gonadotrophin ( ∀-hCG) test, the participant will have study drug interrupted and a 
serum sample submitted to the central laboratory for ∀-hCG testing.
10.17.2. Permanent Discontinuation of Study Intervention
The sponsor’s Clinical team should be consulted as soon as possible and participants may be 
discontinued from study intervention if any of the following occur during the study.  All participants who are randomized should be encouraged to remain in the study through to the end of the double-blind period for safety and efficacy assessments, whether or not they continue to receive study intervention for the full 52 week treatment period, to reduce 090177e1a05d6b35\A pproved\A pproved On: 22-A pr-2024 15:21 (GMT )

Any participant who elects to discontinue study intervention but does not withdraw consent 
should return for all scheduled visits and safety and efficacy assessments, and complete all study-specified assessments through Week 56. Any participant who withdraws consent must 
enter follow-up with their first follow-up visit occurring 1 week after their last dose 
whenever possible, until the event has returned to normal or baseline levels or is deemed clinically stable.  If a participant is lost to follow up, the site should document attempts to contact the participant to continue in the study by registered mail (at last 2 attempts); phone calls and offers to provide transportation to the clinic should be extended. The procedures scheduled for the early withdrawal visit will be performed on the last day the participant takes study intervention or as soon as possible thereafter.  The only exception to this is when a participant specifically withdraws consent for any further contact with him/her or persons previously authorized by the participant to provide this information. 
Participants will be followed post drug discontinuation for 28 days.  Additional follow-up 
visits may occur as needed until any clinically relevant abnormalities or adverse events have resolved, returned to a baseline state, or are deemed clinically stable.090177e1a05d6b35\A pproved\A pproved On: 22-A pr-2024 15:21 (GMT )

Page 21910.22. Appendix 22: eGFR Calculations
The estimated GFR (eGFR) will be calculated using the 2 sets of equations developed by the 
Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI), which utilize serum creatinine (SCr) and serum Cystatin C respectively.
CKD-EPI
2009Scr
If female and SCr is ≤0.7 mg/dL:
!GFR (mL/min/1.73 m2) = 144 x (Scr/0.7)– 0.329x 0.993age (x 1.159, if black).
If female and SCr is >0.7 mg/dL:
!GFR (mL/min/1.73 m2) = 144 x (Scr/0.7) – 1.209x 0.993age(x 1.159, if black).
If male and SCr is ≤0.9 mg/dL:
!GFR (mL/min/1.73 m2) = 141 x (Scr/0.9) – 0.411x 0.993age(x 1.159, if black).
If male and SCr is >0.9 mg/dL:
!GFR (mL/min/1.73 m2) = 141 x (Scr/0.9) – 1.209x 0.993age(x 1.159, if black).
CKD-EPI 2012cys
If female and Scys is ≤0.8 mg/L:
!GFR (mL/min/1.73 m2) = 133 x (Scys /0.8) –0.499x 0.996agex 0.932.
If female and Scys is >0.8 mg/L:
!GFR (mL/min/1.73 m2) = 133 x (Scys /0.8) –1.328x 0.996agex 0.932.
If male and Scys is ≤0.8 mg/L:
!GFR (mL/min/1.73 m2) = 133 x (Scys /0.8) –0.499x 0.996age.
If male and Scys is >0.8 mg/L:

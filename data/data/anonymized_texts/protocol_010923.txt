7 Sept 2017  LUTONIX CONFIDENTIAL  Page 3 of 89 The Lutonix BTK  Trial Protocol Summary  
 
Title  A Prospective, Multicenter, Single Blind, Randomized, Controlled Trial Comparing the 
Lutonix  Drug Coated Balloon  vs. Standard Balloon Angioplasty for Treatment of 
Below -the-Knee (BTK) arteries  
Test Device  Lutonix ® 0.014” OTW Drug Coated PTA Dil atation Catheter  (Lutonix DCB  Catheter ) 
Control Device  Non-coated standard percutaneous transluminal angioplasty balloon catheter (standard  
uncoated PTA catheter)  
Study Design  Prospective, Multicenter, Single Blind, Randomized, Sa fety and Efficacy  
Overview  The study will enroll patients presenting with below -the-knee disease  (Rutherford 
Category  3, 4 or 5) and an angiographically significant (≥ 70%) native artery lesion 
appropriate for angioplasty that is below the tibial plateau  and above the tibiotalar joint .  
After successful protocol -defined pre -dilatation, subjects that continue to meet lesion 
and outflow angiographic criteria are randomized 2:1 to treatment with either the 
Lutonix DCB (test) or standard uncoated PTA catheter (control). A ll target lesion(s) in 
up to two target vessels are treated with the as -randomized test DCB or control PTA.   
After the  protocol -defined pre -dilatation with a standard uncoated PTA catheter  step is 
completed  and if randomized to control, treatment with an additional standard uncoated 
PTA catheter (control device) is at the discretion of the investigator  as long as  0-30% 
residual stenosis  is achieved .  Subjects with no target vessels that meet post -
predilatation entry criteria are excluded (and treated per standard practice) and 
followed for safety for 30 days.  
Primary endpoint assessment is performed at 30 days for  safety and at 6 months for 
efficacy. Doppler is required for all subjects .  Clinical follow -up continues through 3 
years.    
Purpose  To assess the safety and efficacy of the Lutonix DCB  for treatment of stenosis or 
occlusion of native below -the-knee arteries.   
Objective  To demonstrate the superior efficacy and non -inferior safety of the Lutonix DCB  by 
direct comparison to standard PTA cathet er for treatment of stenosis or occlusion of 
below -the-knee  arteries.  
Randomization  Subjects will be randomized 2:1 to Lutonix DCB  or standard PTA catheter . 
Enrollment  Enrollment will occur at up to 75 global centers. Up to 1000 subjects may be enrolled 
to obtain up to  the maximum of 840 treated  vessels for the primary analysis .  The study 
includes interim analyses that occur when 400, 500, 600, and 700 vessels  are treated.   
A Bayesian decision making process will be utilized to determine the final sample size

The purpose of this investigation is to assess the safety and efficacy of the Lutonix™  Drug 
Coated Balloon  (DCB ) for treatment of a stenosis or occlusion of below -the-knee (BTK)  arteries . 
1.1 CLINICAL  BACKGROUND  
Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is estimated to be present in 3% of people in the age range of 
40-59 years and in 20% of people over 70 years1 of age.   Most common clinical presentation 
comprises intermittent claudi cation but about one third of patients will progress to critical limb 
ischemia characterized by rest pain and/or tissue loss, which is the most severe limb 
manifestation of PAD.  Intermittent c laudic ation significantly affects qual ity of life and is 
associated with severe functional impairment .2 While revascularization should be attempted 
without delay in all patients presenting with critical limb ischemia, whenever technically 
possible, the management of intermittent claudication varies depending on  the severity of 
walking impairment and the associated impact of functional disability on individual lifestyle with 
limb revascularization procedures being pursued when exercise and/or drug therapy fail to 
improve symptoms.3   
Revascularization for interm ittent claudication is an appropriate therapy for selected patients 
with disabling symptoms, after a careful risk -benefit analysis and based on comorbid conditions, 
degree of functional impairment, and anatomical factors. 4 Successful revascularization of   lower 
extremity peripheral arterial disease in patients affect ed by intermittent claudication  in addition 
to improving functional status, reduces the occurrence of future major cardiovascular events  
(PTA compared to patients manage with conservative the rapy 6.4% vs. 16.3%; p=0.003).5  The 
same result has been found in the diabetic patient affected with intermittent cludication there was

7 Sept 2017  LUTONIX CONFIDENTIAL  Page 14 of 89 cardiovascular events  with P TA over managed conservative therapy .6 A recent study evaluating 
infrapopliteal angioplasty was performed with a paclitaxel -eluting balloon  in patients with tibial 
artery disease in 104 patients. Of the limbs treated 82.6% were critical limb ischemia (Rut herford 
category 4 -6) and 17.4% severe claudication (Rutherford category 3) resulting in  significantly 
lower early restenosis rate of long -segment infrapopliteal disease after treatment with DEBs  
compared with historical data using uncoated balloons .7  
While various endovascular treatment modalities have been developed for femoropopliteal 
lesions, standard percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) is still most commonly used for 
below -the-knee (BTK) interventions. The majority of patients undergoing BTK interventions 
suffer from critical limb ischemia (CLI) with high cardiovascular risk and often significant 
medical co -morbidities. CLI is typically defined as limb pain that occurs at rest  (Rutherford 
Category 4, 5) 8, or impending limb los s that is caused by severely compromised blood flow to 
the affected extremity.   The principal threat to these patients is failure of the treatment to restore 
and maintain adequate blood flow to relieve ulceration, gangrene, or rest pain, leading to the 
need for a major amputation.   
CLI populations are difficult to study due to their very high intermediate -term morbidity and 
mortality9.  Most subjects die for reasons that cannot be affected by differences in outcomes of 
treatment modalities used during a single interventional revascularization procedure.   As a 
consequence less invasive endovascular revascularization has become the preferred first line 
treatment strategy in many centers due to lower peri -procedural morbidity and mortality as 
compar ed to surgical bypass.  
Two recent meta -analyses10,11studying BTK -PTA reported 1 -year primary patency rates of 
46.5% to 58.1%, limb salvage rates of 86.0% to 88.9% and overall 1 -year survival rates of 85.7% 
to 87.0%.  Another meta -analysis focused on ‘un -reconstructable ’ CLI reported a 1 -year

7 Sept 2017  LUTONIX CONFIDENTIAL  Page 15 of 89 amputation -free survival rate of only 55.1%12.  Two more recent studies, ACHILLES13 and 
DESTINY14, demonstrated improved patency from use of limus -derived DES in short isolated 
lesions.  However, these results are of qu estionable applicability to the broader CLI population 
where long lesions in multiple diseased vessels are common.   
A novel therapy that is commercially available in some countries and under investigation in 
others is the drug coated balloon (DCB), an oth erwise standard PTA catheter with a drug coating 
on the balloon surface.  During angioplasty, DCBs are designed to deliver an anti -proliferative 
drug directly to tissues of the treated vessel wall, thus inhibiting neointimal hyperplasia and 
restenosis with out the need for a permanent foreign body implant.  The investigational device of 
the present study, the Lutonix DCB , is one example.  
DCB s have the potential to provide a more durable treatment and also to improve clinical 
outcomes.  Early data regarding treatment of BTK lesions with drug -coated balloons (DCB) have 
been  positive. BTK treatment with a paclitaxel coated balloon catheter was reported from a 
single -center study investigating 104 patients (82.6 % of whom had CLI). One -year target lesi on 
revascularization was 17.3% and limb salvage rates were 95.6 %. Clinical improvement and 
complete wound healing was 91.2 and 74.2 % respectively .15 Additionally, results from the 
single center D EBATE BTK trial showed superiority of DCB over PTA in tibia l arteries.16 
Binary restenosis was 27% in the DCB and 74% in the PTA  group ( P < 0.001). Finally , target 
lesion revascularization (TLR) was lower in patients treated with DCB com pared to those treated 
with PTA  (18% versus 43 %).  However, results from the a randomized trial  which studied the 
Ampherion DCB (manufactured by Medtronic Inc, MN) for BTK treatment (IN.PACT DEEP) 
has raised concerns  pertaining to the safety and efficacy of  DCBs in infrapopliteal vessels due to 
a trend towards an increased major amp utation and death rate in CLI patients through 12 months 
(DCB=8.8% vs. PTA= 3.6%, p=0.08) .17,18

7 Sept 2017  LUTONIX CONFIDENTIAL  Page 16 of 89 Consecutive Leipzig registries19,20 demonstrate a similar benefit for single -arm, open -label DCB 
over historic PTA, with 3 -month angiographic occlusion rate of 9.5% for DCB (n = 104) 
compared to 37.6% for control PTA (n = 50).  In the DCB registry, the 1 -year TLR rate was 17% 
and limb salva ge was 96%10, which is significantly better than the outcomes reported for 
currently -available treatment modalities in the meta -analyses discussed above.  DCB also 
performed better than control PTA in the subset with below -the-knee lesions treated in the 
“Drug -Eluting Balloon Evaluation for Lower Limb Multilevel Treatment” (DEBELLUM) 
study21.  These initial  results for DCB are consistent and very promising, and larger randomized 
trials are warranted to establish the safety and efficacy of DCB used to treat below -the-knee 
lesions.  
1.1.1 THE LEVANT  I FIRST-IN-MAN TRIAL SUMMARY  
Lutonix recently completed the  LEVANT I clinical trial22 in which the Lutonix DCB  Catheter 
was compared to a standard PTA catheter (with and without stenting) for treatment of stenotic 
femorop opliteal arteries.   The primary endpoint was angiographic late lumen loss at 6 months, 
as determined by an independent angiographic core lab analysis.  One hundred -one randomized 
subjects were  enrolled at 9 European centers.  After a defined pre -dilatatio n, subjects were 
stratified to the balloon strata or stent strata and then randomized to treatment with the Lutonix  
DCB  (n=49) or a standard PTA catheter ( n=52, control group).   
The Lutonix DCB exhibit ed significantly less late lumen loss (0.46 ± 1.13 mm)  compared to that 
observed for conventional angioplasty (1.09 ± 1.07  mm) at 6 months  (p=0.016).  There were no 
unanticipated adverse device effects in the DCB arm, and overall adverse event rates were 
similar to conventional uncoated balloon angioplasty  through 24 months.  T aken together, t he 
primary objective of the trial was met, and the angiographic and clinical results of the LEVANT 
I trial demonstrated the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of use of the Lutonix DCB for treatment 
of femoropopliteal lesi ons. 
1.1.2 THE LEV ANT  2 PIVOTAL IDE  TRIAL  
The pivotal Levant 2 IDE trial ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) was designed in collaboration with physicians 
and FDA to demonstrate safety and efficacy of the Lutonix Catheter  for treatment of 
femoropopliteal lesions in a larger population and to obtain US FDA  approval. Levant 2 is a

7 Sept 2017  LUTONIX CONFIDENTIAL  Page 17 of 89 treatment of symptomatic femoropopliteal artery lesions with Lutonix Catheter  vs. uncoated 
PTA .  
The trial pre -specified two primary endpoints that must both be met for trial  success . The 
prim ary effectiveness endpoint is primary patency of the target lesion at 1 year. Primary patency 
is defined as the absence of target lesion restenosis and freedom from target lesion 
revascularization (TLR).The primary safety endpoint is freedom from all -cause  perioperative 
(≤30 day) death and freedom at 1 year from the following: index limb amputation  (above or 
below the ankle), index limb reintervention, and index -limb-related death.  The tested hypothesis 
was that DCB would demonstrate superior effectiveness and non -inferior safety compared to 
PTA.  
The trial enrolled patients with symptomatic claudication or ischemic rest pain (Rutherford 
category 2 -4) and an angiographically significant atherosclerotic lesion (>70% diameter stenosis, 
≤15 cm length) in the sup erficial femoral and/or popliteal arteries of diameter 4 to 6 mm with a 
patent outflow artery to the foot.   
Enrollment began in July 2011, and randomization of 476 patients (n = 316 DCB vs. N = 160 
PTA) at 55 centers was completed in July 2012.  One year follow -up and primary endpoint 
analysis has been completed, and clinical follow -up is ongoing through 5 years .  
Baseline demographics, comorbidities, and lesion characteristics were well matched between 
groups; 43% of patients were diabetic, 35% were current smokers, and 8% had critical limb 
ischemia (CLI). The mean lesion length was 62.8 mm and the treated lengt h was 108 mm.  
Levant 2 met both pre-specified primary endpoints.  Primary patency for Lutonix Catheter  
(65.2%) was superior to control PTA (52.6%, p= 0.015) at 12 months, demonstrating superior 
efficacy.  The primary safety endpoint success rate for Luton ix DCB (83.9%) was non -inferior to 
control PTA (79.0%, p = 0.005).  Freedom from TLR was 87.7% for DCB compared to 83.2% 
for control PTA.  
Several secondary endpoints were also analysed but not hypothesis tested. Procedural success (< 
30% residual stenosis  without SAE) was similar for Lutonix Catheter  and control PTA (88.9% 
vs. 86.8%), demonstrating effectiveness at acute restoration of patency. The Rutherford scores, 
walking impairment (WIQ) scores, ABI, six minute walk test, and quality of life questionna ires 
each showed improvements from before treatment through 12 months in both  treatment groups. 
At 12 months , 88.2% of Lutonix DCB patients and 82.4% of control PTA patients had improved 
Rutherford Class compared to baseline. Mean improvement in the WIQ to tal score was 23.9 ± 
27.6% for Lutonix DCB compared to 19.2 ± 26.5% for control PTA, and improvement in WIQ 
walking distance was 31.5 ± 37.0% vs. 22.2 ± 35.4%, respectively. Improvements in ABI, six 
minute walk test, EQ -5D, and SF -36v2 through 12 months we re similar for both groups.  
Secondary safety endpoints were generally similar for Lutonix Catheter  and control PTA. These  
included, respectively, all -cause death (2.4% vs. 2.8%), amputation (0.3% vs. 0.0%),  
amputation -free survival (97.6% vs. 97.2%), thro mbosis (0.4% vs. 0.7%), target vessel

similar for both treatment groups and consistent with historic data for the enrolled population 
with symptomatic PAD.  
Levant 2 successfully demonstrated superior efficacy and non -inferior s afety of Lutonix Catheter  
compared to control PTA.  
1.2 DEVICE  AND  STUDY  RATIONALE  
The Lutonix BTK DCB Catheter is intended for use as a percutaneous transluminal angioplasty 
(PTA) catheter for dilatation of obstructive de novo or non -stented restenotic lesions in native 
popliteal, tibial, and peroneal arteries ≥ 2.0 and ≤ 4.0mm in diame ter.  The drug coating on the 
Lutonix  DCB  contains paclitaxel and excipients  (polysorbate and sorbitol ) with a history of 
human safety for intravenous use.  Each component has been safely used in other products.  PTA 
catheters have been in commercial use f or over 25 years, and the Lutonix  DCB  Catheter  meets 
international standards (e.g. ISO 10555) developed over time to validate the mechanical safety of 
dilation catheters.  The anti -proliferative drug paclitaxel is a well understood active 
pharmaceutical in gredient ( API) with an extensive history of human use in oncology23 and drug -
eluting stents (DES)24.  The maximum total dose o f 3.8 mg on the largest peripheral Lutonix  
DCB  Catheter  is less than 2% of the dose of a pproximately  300 mg infused during a singl e 
course of cancer therapy.  In addition, GLP animal Safety and 4x dose Safety Margin studies 
have been performed to confirm the safety of the Lutonix  DCB  Catheter . 
 
2 STUDY  OBJECTIVES  AND  ENDPOINTS  
 
2.1 PRIMARY  OBJECTIVE  
The primary objective of the Lutonix BTK study  is to demonstrate the superior efficacy and non -
inferior safety of the Lutonix DCB  Catheter  by direct comparison to standard PTA catheter for 
treatment of stenosis or occlusion of below -the-knee arteries.   
Enrollment will occur at up to 75 global centers. Up to 1000 subjects may be enrolled to obtain 
up to  the maximum of 840 treated vessels for the primary analysis .   
Clinical follow -up is scheduled at 30 days , 6, 12, 24 and 36 months .

Document: CL0005 -01  Revision: 12 
7 Sept 2017  LUTONIX CONFIDENTIAL  Page 19 of 89 2.2 PRIMARY  ENDPOINTS  
 
2.2.1 SAFETY  
The primary safety endpoint is freedom from BTK MALE (major adverse limb event) + POD 
(peri -operative death) at 30 Days. This is strictly defined as the composite at 30 days of all -cause 
death, above -ankle amputation or major reintervention (new bypass gra ft, jump/interposition 
graft revision, or thrombectomy/thrombolysis) of the index limb involving a below -the-knee 
artery . 
Percutaneous vascular reintervention involving a BTK artery is considered less major (than 
death, amputation, bypass, or thrombolysis)  and is not counted as a failure of the primary safety 
endpoint. Since percutaneous reintervention is captured as a failure of the primary efficacy 
endpoint, this serves to decrease endpoint concordance that would otherwise arise from having 
the most commo n serious adverse event in both co -primary endpoints.  In addition, not counting 
percutaneous reintervention as a failure made it possible to determine an expected failure rate, 
which was necessary for study powering. Unlike at 12 -months, from historical  studies it is nearly 
impossible to tease out an expected 30 -day rate of percutaneous reintervention with a mandatory 
30-day clinical visit. In contrast, there is very good data for MALE and POD. Two recent meta -
analyses10,11 report 30 day data for elements  of the composite safety endpoint . 
Major but not minor amputation s are considered safety failures. In the enrolled population with 
significant risk of limb loss, many minor toe amputations will have already been planned at the 
time of the index procedure a nd will not constitute major adverse safety events.  Pre-defined 
clinical events, including index limb -relatedness of death, will be adjudicated by the blinded 
CEC.  
Major reintervention s below -the-knee are considered a safety failure but reintervention abo ve-
the-knee is not. Since about half of enrolled subjects are expected to also require inflow 
treatment, and this will be allowed prior to randomization, above -the-knee re -interventions 
reflect safety of a pre -randomization procedure and could only confoun d safety assessment of the 
device used for treatment below -the-knee.  
2.2.2 EFFICACY  
The primary efficacy endpoint is the c omposite of Limb Salvage and primary patency at 6 
months.  The p rimary efficacy endpoint is defined as freedom from the composite of above ankle 
amputation, target lesion  occlusion, and clinically -driven target lesion reintervention.  
 
Clinically -driven is defined by stagnant or worsening wound healing, new or recurrent wound, or 
worsening of Rutherford Class in index limb.  
 
Freedom from occlusion must be established by angiography and/or Doppler. Angiography is the 
gold standard for target lesion assessment, and patency will be  determined by angiography if 
performed.  Patency will be assessed by Doppler if angiography is not performed.

Document: CL0005 -01  Revision: 12 
7 Sept 2017  LUTONIX CONFIDENTIAL  Page 20 of 89 Although binary restenosis based on angiographic 50% diameter stenosis (%DS) became popular 
in the context of coronary stenting, clinical relevance with respect to its use in infrapopliteal 
artery assessments is  uncertain, particularly if ischemic wounds and rest pain have healed and 
there is in -line flow.  A more clinically meaningful measure of target vessel patency in this 
population may be the original surgeon’s definition of patency , i.e. “open” or “closed” vessel.  
This definition of patency allow s a less stringent requirement for angiography.  Therefore, the 
primary efficacy endpoint measure for this study is freedom -from -occlusion and not freedom -
from -binary restenosis (arbitrarily 50%DS) , which is instead captured as a secondary endpoint .   
Doppler is required at all clinical visits .  Even in calcified tibial arteries, the presence of 
antegrade flow through the target vessel can usually be established by Doppler.

• Change in Rutherford Class  (target limb)

3 DEVICE  DESCRIPTION   
The Lutonix DCB Catheter consists of an OTW catheter with a DCB  fixed at the distal tip.  The 
uncoated portion of the device consists of a dual lumen shaft with a high pressure dilatation 
balloon mounted on the distal tip.  Two radiopaque marker bands del ineate the working length of 
the balloon and are located under the proximal and distal ends of the balloon to facilitate 
fluoroscopic visualization of the DCB  during delivery and placement.   The balloon surface 
between the marker bands is coated with a spe cialized immediate release non -polymer based 
coating formulation that includes the anti -proliferative drug – paclitaxel - at a surface 
concentration of 2μg/mm2 and two well-known  carriers polysorbate and sorbitol.  
The coaxial catheter includes a low profil e, semi -compliant balloon formed to a low profile 
tapered tip to facilitate advancement of the catheter to and through the stenotic region of the 
vessel.  The proximal portion of the catheter includes a female luer lock hub connected to the 
inflation lumen  used to inflate and deflate the balloon, and a female luer lock hub connected to 
the guidewire lumen.  The guide wire lumen ends at the tip of the catheter and permits the use of 
guidewires for advancement of the catheter through the stenotic lesion.   
A balloon Compliance Chart is included on each device product label.  
The Lutonix DCB Catheter is compatible with 0.014” (0.36mm) guidewires and is available in 
150cm lengths.  Each product has a peelable balloon protector that has been positioned over the

7 Sept 2017  LUTONIX CONFIDENTIAL  Page 22 of 89 balloon for protection prior to use.  To prevent crushing of the Luto nix DCB Catheter wire 
lumen, a disposable stainless steel stylet resides in the lumen.  
The Lutonix DCB Catheter operates on the principle of hydraulic pressurization applied through 
an inflatable balloon attached to the distal end.  Upon inflation, the ba lloon expands to a 
specified diameter as defined per the Compliance Chart on the product label.  
The catheter is made of common materials typical of standard PTA catheters.  The investigator 
should verify device size availability before each procedure.  Alwa ys follow the current 
Instructions for Use (IFU) for procedural information, preparation and use of the Lutonix DCB  
Catheter . 
All devices are provided sterile and are for single -use only.  Devices are clearly labeled for 
investigational use only.

3.1 INTENDED  USE  / INDICATIONS  FOR  USE  
The Lutonix DCB Catheter is intended for percutaneous transluminal angioplasty of obstructive 
de novo or non‐stented  restenotic l esions in the native popliteal, tibial, and peroneal arteries ≥ 2.0 
and ≤ 4.0mm in diameter . 
 
3.2 ACTIVE  PHARMACEUTICAL  INGREDIENT  (API) : PACLITAXEL  
Paclitaxel, discovered in 1967 and commercially developed by Bristol -Myers Squibb, is a well 
known mitotic inhibitor indicated for use in the treatment of patients with lung, ovarian, breast, 
head and neck cancers and advanced forms of Kaposi’s sarcoma.  Paclitaxel is also approved for 
the prevention of restenosis.  Various dosages are used depending on  target treatment and range 
from multiple 300  mg IV infusions for  oncology therapy to a single maximal nominal dose of 
282 µg for devices that treat restenosis, such as coronary stents.  Please refer to  
Figure  2 and the Investigator ’s Brochure for a more detailed review of paclitaxel.

FIGURE 2 : CHEMICAL STRUCTURE OF PACLITAXEL  
3.3 EXCIPIENT  (DRUG CARRIER ) 
The balloon coating inc ludes small amounts of well-known  excipients  (polysorbate and sorbitol ) 
that are approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as inactive ingredients in drug 
products for intravenous (IV) drug delivery.  
3.4 DEVICE  INSTRUCTIONS  
A comprehensive set of Instructions for Use (IFU), including warnings and precautions, has been 
created.  Please refer to the most current IFU for complete details on preparation and procedural 
use of the device.  A sample IFU can be found  in Appendix  E.  
3.5 SUPPLY  & SUPPORT  OF INVESTIGATIONAL  DEVICE   
An investigational device supply of the Lutonix  DCB  Catheter will be made available to all 
activated study sites.  The investigational device matrix that is currently available for this study 
is referenced in the current IFU .  Always confirm current site i nventory supply prior to enrolling 
subjects into the study.   
Prior to start of study enrollment , Lutonix or their designee  will perform device training for study 
site personnel and support staff.  Each study site will receive a supply of the Lutonix  DCB  
Catheter s upon completion of the protocol requirements for study initiation.  Additional training 
and support will be provided  as needed  on an ongoing basis.   Any unused devices  must be 
returned to the sponsor at the time site enrollment stops or upon sponsor request.  After use, this 
product may be a potential biohazard.  Handle and dispose of in accordance with acceptable 
medical practices and applicable local, state and federa l laws and regulations.   For quality control 
purposes, devices may be requested to be returned to the sponsor before or after use, in which 
case the site should return devices by requesting a Return Material Authorization (RMA) number 
from the Sponsor.  
4 RISK-BENEFIT  ANALYSIS  
4.1 POTENTIAL  RISKS  
The potential risks and benefits of participation in this study are clearly identified in the  subject 
Informed Consent Form (ICF) and are to be explained to the subject  and/or their legal 
representative prior to participa ting in the study.  The Lutonix  DCB  Catheter and standard 

Lutonix BTK Investigational Plan  
Document: CL0005 -01  Revision: 12 
7 Sept 2017  LUTONIX CONFIDENTIAL  Page 24 of 89 uncoated percutaneous angioplasty catheters are intended to be the only devices used for 
treatment of the target lesion.   
Due to the high similarity of the Lutonix  DCB  Catheter  to other marketed ba lloon catheters, 
procedural use is not expected to significantly change or increase risks during the initial 
procedure.  However, it shares the risks of conventional  balloon  angioplasty treatment of patients 
with vascular disease  in the lower extremities .  There may also be risks associated with the drug 
coating on the Lutonix  DCB  Catheter  that are unknown at this time.  Please refer to the 
Investigator ’s Brochure for more details on the development of the Lutonix  DCB  Catheter . 
4.1.1 RISKS FOR PERIPHERAL CATHETERIZATION PROCEDURE  
Potential adverse events which may be associated with a peripheral balloon dilatation 
catheterization procedure include, but are not  limited to, the following:  
• abnormal heart rhythms  
• abrupt vessel closure  
• allergic reaction  
• aneurysm or rupture of the artery  
• AV fistula  
• bleeding  
• death  
• dissection  
• embolization  
• femoral nerve compression with associated neuropathy  
• groin area bruising and disc omfort  
• hematoma  
• hypotension/hypertension  
• inflammation  
• kidney failure  
• low blood pressure  
• pain or tenderness  
• perforation  
• pseudoaneurysm  
• respiratory failure  
• sepsis/infection  
• shock  
• stroke  
• total occlusion or thrombosis  
• vessel dissection, perforation, rupture, or spasm that may require re -intervention or 
surgery 
• additional  angiographic intervention, surgical intervention, or amputation  
Lutonix BTK Investigational Plan  
Document: CL0005 -01  Revision: 12 
7 Sept 2017  LUTONIX CONFIDENTIAL  Page 25 of 89 There may be other potential adverse events that are unforeseen at this time.  
Even if the ball oon catheter  procedure is deemed successful, it is associated with a meaningful 
risk of vessel narrowing within 12 months (depending on risk factors).  Additional therapy may 
be required within 12 months such as reintervention using angioplasty or surgery.    
Patients undergoing an interventional procedure are often treated with courses  of thienopyridines 
such as c lopidogrel  or prasugrel,  which may cause thrombocytopenic purpura and /or bleeding 
complications.   In rare cases, these drugs may cause a significant reduction in white blood cell 
count, which may in turn result in serious infections.  Aspirin is also a common drug used before 
and after such procedures.  Aspirin is known to contribute occasionally to c ausing 
gastrointestinal ulcers (bleeding or non -bleeding).   Aspirin may also affect platelet function to 
the extent of causing bleeding complications (which may be minor, major, or life threatening).  If 
such conditions occur, the patient may require surge ry, blood transfusion, or platelet transfusion.   
Any of the above could cause prolonged illness, permanent impairment of daily function or, in 
rare cases, death. Possible treatments could include, but are not limited to emergency PTA and 
vascular surgery.   It is expected that the fluoroscopy time of the interventional procedure will be 
similar to the time required for conventional percutaneous lower extremity interventional 
procedures and not pose additional risks to the subject  or lab personnel.   
4.1.2 ASSOCIAT ED RISKS FROM THE DRUG COATING  
The balloon coating includes the API paclitaxel and small amounts of well-known  excipients  
(polysorbate and sorbitol ) that are approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as 
inactive ingredients in drug products for in travenous (IV) drug delivery.  Additional adverse 
events that may be unique to the paclitaxel drug coating include:   
• allergic/immunologic reaction  
• alopecia  
• anemia  
• blood product transfusion  
• gastrointestinal symptoms  
• hematologic dyscrasia (including leu kopenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia)  
• hepatic enzyme changes  
• histologic changes in vessel wall, including inflammation, cellular damage or necrosis  
• myalgia/ arthralgia  
• peripheral neuropathy  
There may be other risks associated with the drug c oating that are unknown at this time.   
There are no adequate and well -controlled studies published in pregnant women or men 
intending to father children who have received paclitaxel.  Studies performed in rats and rabbits 
receiving IV paclitaxel during or ganogenesis revealed evidence of maternal toxicity, 
embryotoxicity, and fetotoxicity at dosages of 1 and 3 mg/kg, respectively (approximately 3 and 
Lutonix BTK Investigational Plan  
Document: CL0005 -01  Revision: 12 
7 Sept 2017  LUTONIX CONFIDENTIAL  Page 26 of 89 16 times the dose provided by the largest femoropopliteal Lutonix  DCB  Catheter  coated with 3.8 
mg of paclitaxel adjusted for body surface area ). The  drug resulted in increased resorptions and 
increased fetal deaths.  No teratogenicity was observed in gravid rats receiving daily IV 
paclitaxel doses of 1 mg/kg (a daily dose of approxi mately 3 times the dose of the largest 
Lutonix  DCB  Catheter , adjusted for body surface area). Enrollment of women  who are of 
childbearing potential or in men intending to father children should therefore take reproductive 
risk into careful consideration.  
4.2 RISK  MANAGEMENT  PROCEDURES  
Eligibility criteria have been selected that exclude patients who are at a higher risk for  
experiencing an anticipated adverse event in order to reduce the risks to subject s who participate 
in this study.  In addition, subject s enrolled in this study should be receiving a defined anti -
platelet regime n.  In addition, follow -up duplex ultrasound will be performed to assess the target 
vessel patency . All adverse events are monitored and  events will be adjudicated  by the Clinical 
Event s Committee  per Section 12.3. 
Extensive reliability engineering testing has been performed on the Lutonix  DCB  Catheter  to 
help mitigate any risks to the subject s due to product failure.  Additionally, animal studies using 
the Lutonix  DCB  Catheter  have been conducted to ensure that the device performs as intended 
without introducing more risks during the interventional proc edure.  
Investigational device training will be conducted at each initiated study center and appropriate 
training records will be maintained.  
4.3 POTENTIAL  BENEFITS  
There are no guaranteed benefits from participation in this study; however, it is possible tha t 
treatment with the Lutonix  DCB  Catheter  may reduc e the potential for restenosis  of the lesion (s), 
thereby reducing the need for repeat hospitalization and/or procedure(s).  
Additionally, information gained from the conduct of this study may be of benefit  to others with 
the same medical condition. As with all investigational medical devices, the long -term results of 
using the Lutonix  DCB  Catheter  are not known at the present time.  Alternatives to the use of the 
Lutonix  DCB  Catheter  include standard  or cut ting balloon angioplasty, vascular stenting, 
atherectomy, cryoplasty, or vascular radiation and surgery  (vessel bypass with native or synthetic 
vessel) .  Lutonix believes that the risk for significant injury or death due to the Lutonix  DCB  
Catheter  is extr emely low, and the potential benefits of decreased restenosis and decreased need 
for reintervention is likely, but these potential risks and benefits have yet to be quantified.  
4.4 EARLY  TERMINATION  
Lutonix, Inc. ( Sponsor ) and the Data Monitoring Committee  (DMC ) will monitor the progression 
of the study.  If warranted, the study may be suspended or discontinued early if there is an 
observation of serious adverse reactions presenting an unreasonable risk to the study population.   
The Sponsor may te rminate Investigator and site participation in the study for issues including 
but not limited to the following issues:  
Lutonix BTK Investigational Plan  
Document: CL0005 -01  Revision: 12 
7 Sept 2017  LUTONIX CONFIDENTIAL  Page 27 of 89 • Evidence of an Investigator’s failure to maintain adequate clinical standards  
• Evidence of an Investigator or staff’s failure to comply w ith the protocol  
• Inaccuracy or late submission of data forms and core lab images  
• Inability to meet enrollment targets ( 1 subject /month)  
• Conditions of approval imposed by the reviewing IRB/EC and/or regulatory agencies  
• Evidence of safety concerns or protoco l non -compliance  
• Change of staff at site that adversely impacts trial conduct   
Any evident pattern of non -compliance with respect to these standards will be cause for the site 
to be put on probation.  If corrective actions are not subsequently undertaken, the clinical site 
will be as ked to withdraw from the study and their site may be replaced . 
Notification of suspension or termination will occur no later than five (5) working days after the 
Sponsor  makes the determination.  In the event of stud y suspension or termination, the Sponsor  
will send a report outlining the circumstances to the Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Ethics 
Committee (EC), and all Investigator s and Regulatory Authorities as required by regulation .  A 
suspended or terminated st udy may not be re -initiated without approval of the reviewing  IRB/EC 
and Regulatory Authorities, as required by regulation . 
The Investigator must notify the IRB/EC in writing as soon as possible but no later than within 
10 days if the premature termination  is related to safety or compliance issues.  
5 CLINICAL  STUDY  DESIGN    
The study will enroll patients presenting with below -the-knee disease  (Rutherford Category 3, 4, 
or 5) and an angiographically significant (≥ 70%) native artery lesion appropriate for angioplasty 
that is below the knee and above the ankle.  After successful protocol -defined pre -dilatation, 
subjects that continue to meet lesion and outflow angiographi c criteria are stratified by 
Rutherford Category and randomized 2:1 to treatment with either the Lutonix DCB (test) or 
standard uncoated PTA catheter (control). All target lesion(s) in up to two target vessels are 
treated with the as -randomized (by subject ) test DCB or control PTA devices.  After the 
protocol -defined pre -dilatation with a standard uncoated PTA catheter step is completed and if 
randomized to control, treatment with an additional standard uncoated PTA catheter (control 
device) is at the discr etion of the investigator as long as 0-30% residual stenosis  is achieved .  
Subjects with no target vessels that meet post -pre-dilatation entry criteria are excluded (and 
treated per standard practice) and followed for safety for 30 days.  
All subjects will have ultrasound and clinical follow -up through 36 months . There is no pre -set 
limit to site enrollment, however site enrollment will be tracked and managed to ensure 
approximately 50% of the overall randomized enrollment occurs at US sites.   
Primary effica cy endpoint assessment is performed at 6 months. Clinical follow -up continues 
through 3 6 month s.  The study treatment algorithm flow -chart is shown below in Figure 3 . Bail-

procedure may be performed whenever appropriate, in the investigator’s judgment.  
If a ‘ proximal vessel  only’ arm of the trial is required per the adaptive study design (see Section 
15 of this protocol for additional details), t hen an additional inclusion criterion which defines this 
patient population, will be implemented  and followed .  There are no changes to the procedural 
steps listed in this section above, that is successful pre-dilatation , randomization 2:1 ratio, 36 
month follow -up with primary endpoin t at 6 months, will still be followed.  The schedule of 
events listed in Table 3 of this protocol will still also b e followed for this study arm.

7 Sept 2017  LUTONIX CONFIDENTIAL  Page 29 of 89 5.1 SCREENING  PROCEDURES  
All Rutherford  3, 4, and 5 patients presenting  for a percutaneous revascu larization of a n artery (s) 
below the tibial plateau and above the tibiotalar joint should be screened for study eligibility.   
Patients categorized as a Rutherford Clinical Category 3 must have failed medical management 
per physician discretion.   Once the patient’s eligibility has be en determined, the Investigator  will 
discuss the study and ask the patient to participate.   Prior to enrollment, the patient must sign the 
Informed Consent Form  (ICF)  approved for use by the IRB/EC  or other appropriate committee.  
A copy of the signed and dated ICF will be provided to the subject .  Subject s will be assured that 
they may withdraw from the study at any time and for any reason.   The background and purpose 
of the study , participation  requirements,  as well as the potential benefits and risks of the 
procedure(s) must  be explained to the subject .   
The status of all patients screened, whether enrolled, withdrawn, etc., should be captured on the 
study Screening Log for tracking and reporting purposes.    
If not already performed as standard practice, t he following clinical assessments and tests must 
be performed after obtaining informed consent and prior to the index procedure (within 30 days 
unless otherwise noted ) to verify and complete eligibility:  
• Physical examination  (including blood pre ssure, heart rate, and temperature)  
• Relevant  medical history  
• Rutherford Classification  (index  limb)  
• Pregnancy Test (blood or urine; if female of child bearing potential)  
• Resting TBI ( if possible ) and ABI (within 90 days)  
• Walking Impairment Questionnaire  
• EQ-5D Questionnaire  
• Wound Assessment  (including collection of images)     
 
Information already in the patient’s medical record that has been collected as part of standard 
hospital practice (including, for example, medical history, physical exa mination, Rutherford 
Classification, ankle and toe pressures) may be used as baseline data even if collected before the 
Informed Consent Form was signed.  
5.2 PATIENT  SELECTION  FOR  ENROLLMENT  
Subjects must meet all the clinical eligibility criteria, agree to pa rticipate and comply with study 
protocol requirements and follow -up schedule and provide informed consent.  
All subject s are expected to remain available (geographically stable) for the duration of the study 
follow -up period.  If any subject  moves away, eve ry effort must be made to maintain the follow -
up schedule including having an appropriate physician follow the subject .  The Investigator  is 
responsible for ensuring that each follow -up visit occurs at the specified time and that all 
applicable data is reviewed and entered into the electronic case report form system (eCRF) in a 
timely fashion.

6 STUDY/TREATMENT  PROCEDURES  
6.1 ENROLLMENT  
Informed consent must be obtained prior to study -specific testing (that would not have been 
performed per standard -of-care of non -study subjects). A subject is considered enrolled in the 
study after both of the following steps have occ urred:  
• Baseline angiographic confirmation that the target lesion (s) meets all appropriate

6.2 LUTONIX  DCB  CATHETER  INSTRUCTIONS  FOR  USE  (IFU)  
Always follow the current IFU for procedural information, preparation  and use  of the  Lutonix  
DCB  Catheter .  Any devices found to be defective or that do not perform as expected should be 
returned immediately to the Sponsor  for evaluation and a Device Malfunction Form  must  be 
completed.   A balloon compliance chart is included on each device product label.  
In orde r to achieve the best procedural outcomes, the following steps should be completed:  
• The Lutonix DCB catheter should be advanced to the target site as fast as possible (~ 30 
seconds).  
• The DCB should be immediately inflated when reaching the target site to a ppropriate 
pressure to ensure full wall apposition (balloon to artery ratio of ≥ 1:1).  
• Maintain the DCB inflation for a minimum of 2 minutes (120 seconds) .  The balloon may 
remain inflated as long as is required by the standard of care to achieve a good 
angioplasty outcome.  
• For optimal results, the fina l percent stenosis should be 0 -20%. 
If more than one Lutonix  DCB  Catheter will be needed to treat the entire pre -dilated 
segment(s)/lesion(s), the combination of lengths available should be carefully conside red 
beforehand to ensure complete coverage of the target lesions ( maximum allowed cumulative 
length of all DCBs ≤ 360 mm ) and, at the same time, reduce unnecessary vessel dilatation.  The 
IFU also contains detailed information on lesion coverage .   
6.3 BASELIN E ANGIOGRAM  
DSA - or Cine - angiograms should be obtained per core lab guideline .  Standard off -line QVA 
acquisition procedures will be followed for analysis at the independent imaging core laboratory. 
All angiography procedures (both index  and non -scheduled) must be recorded in such a way that 
they are suited for off -line QVA.  For purpo ses of ensuring protocol compliance, all angiograms 
must be submitted to the core laboratory as soon after the case as possible.  
6.4 IN-FLOW  LESION  TREATMENT  
Absence of inflow disease  (≥50% stenosis) as confirmed by angiography is required for 
enrollment in th e study. Concurrent or staged treatment of iliac , SFA, and above -knee popliteal 
artery lesion is allowed  if successfully performed (residual diameter stenosis ≤  30%) without 
major vascular complication .  If atherectomy is performed on the superficial femor al or popliteal  
lesion (s), use of distal embolic filter is required.   Treatment of SFA/popliteal inflow lesions must 
terminate 3 0 mm  above the tibial plateau  (i.e., there must be a segment of healthy artery between 
Lutonix BTK Investigational Plan  
Document: CL0005 -01  Revision: 12 
7 Sept 2017  LUTONIX CONFIDENTIAL  Page 35 of 89 any treated inflow lesions and potential target vessel lesions  below the knee ). Treatment of aortic 
and common femoral lesions is not allowed.  
6.5 PRE -DILATATION  AND  TARGET  VESSEL  ENTRY  CRITERIA  
 
NOTE: All angioplasty balloons used for vessel pre -dilation or treatment of control arm subjects 
must be uncoated, standard PTA balloons. Balloons that incorporate a contoured  surface, 
external wire support, cutting/scoring  component , or other similar modificati ons may NOT be 
used for pre -dilation or control arm treatment.  
 
Always refer to the current IFU for complete pre -dilatation requirements.  The pre -dilatation 
balloon should be a standard PTA balloon  appropriate size for the reference vessel  diameter .  
Always limit the longitudinal length of the pre -dilatation balloon to avoid creating a region of 
vessel injury that is outside the boundaries of the area to be treated by the Lutonix DCB (i.e., to 
avoid geographic miss).  In order to reduce dissections and  potential exclusion of target vessels  
after pre -dilatation, careful and controlled pre -dilatation(s) inflations should be performed and 
recorded (on film).  
 
When possible, it is strongly encouraged to attempt treatment of the vessel perfusing the 
ischemic  tissue ( the site of ulceration or gangrene) based on the angiosome concept. This may 
not always be possible, and treatment of other vessels is allowed to maximally perfuse the at -risk 
ischemic limb  at the operator’s discretion . Ensure that all target lesion diameters can be treated 
with the Lutonix DCB device sizes available ; e.g., do not include a popliteal lesion with RVD 
diameter greater than largest available Lutonix DCB device size of 4.0mm . 
 
Per protocol, target lesions must be located in one or two native artery(s) below the tibial plateau 
(proximal boundary) and above the tibiotalar joint (distal boundary) ( Figure 4).

FIGURE 4: PROXIMAL (A) AND DISTAL (B) TARGET VESSEL BOUNDARIES  
 
Retrograde access for initial wire crossing or use of crossing devices is allowed, but pre -
dilatation and treatment must be performed over an antegrade wire . Manual pressure hemostasis 
should be conducted on the retrograde access site (not balloon inflatio n). One or two flow 
pathways are allowed as target vessel(s); i.e., peroneal or posterior tibial arteries may involve 
tibioperoneal trunk lesions and tibial arteries may involve popliteal lesions, as illustrated below 
in Figure  5. Peroneal or posterior tibial artery l esions (diffuse or focal) that extend into the 
tibioperoneal trunk can be counted as one target artery  (Figure 5A).  Similarly, lesions (diffuse or 
focal) in the anterior tibial artery that extend into the popliteal artery can be counted as one target 
artery  (Figure 5B).

adaptive study design ; see Section 15  of this protocol  for details .   
 
In this case,  only the target lesions completely within the proximal 2/3rd segment (see Figure 6) 
will continue to be enrolled in th is study.  
 
 
FIGURE 6. PROXIMAL VESSEL  SEGMENT  (APPLICABLE FOR ENROLLMENT OF PROXIMAL VESSEL S 
ONLY) 
 
Antegrade pre -dilatation of target lesion (s) is performed with a standard PTA catheter 
appropriate size for the reference vessel  diameter .  Successful pre-dilatation is defined as residual 
stenosis ≤ 50% and operator determination that procedural success may be achievable by 
angioplasty alone .  Multiple lesions , up to 320 mm in cumulative le ngth, may be pre -dilated , but 
ALL target lesions MUST be successfully pre -dilated and assessed  prior to randomization .  
Outflow  must be  assessed AFTER pre -dilatation . Each t arget vessel(s) (flow path) must 
reconstitute(s) at or  above the ankle with inline  flow to at least one patent (<50%) inframalleolar 
outflow vessel . Note that planned treatment below -the-ankle is not allowed , and l ateral and tarsal 
branches of the peroneal artery can be considered to represent acceptable pate nt outflow post -
pre-dilatation.  In addition, note that a subject with a pre -dilated popliteal artery that fails to meet 
angiographic inclusion criteria CANNOT be randomized, since the popliteal artery is upstream 
of all flow from the 3 crural run-off vessels  to the foot.  

Lutonix BTK Investigational Plan  
Document: CL0005 -01  Revision: 12 
7 Sept 2017  LUTONIX CONFIDENTIAL  Page 38 of 89  
Multiple lesions in two target vessels are allowed, but each target vessel flow path MUST 
demonstrate inline  inframalleolar outflow prior to randomization . If pre -dilatation of one vessel 
is attempted but fails to meet criteri a, it is not a target vessel and is instead treated per  
institutional  standard practice.  Another vessel may be attempted.  If pre -dilatation of two vessels 
is attempted, and only one meets lesion and outflow criteria, then there is only one target vessel 
for that subject. The other vessel is treated per institutional  standard of care and is not a target 
vessel. If, after pre -dilatation, no target lesions meet angiographic lesion and outflow criteria, the 
subject will not be randomized but will be instead t reated per institutional standard practice.  
Non-randomized subjects excluded after pre -dilatation will be followed for 30 days for safety 
and then withdrawn  from the study . 
 
See Table 1 for an overview of target vessel and outflow assessment and outcome.

the subject cannot be randomized but is instead to be treated per investigator’s standard practice.  
NOTE : When ever possible, it is preferable to complete all intended interventional procedures on 
non-target vessels prior to randomization . This is to ensure a balanced distribution between arms , 
and to allow for proper attribution of any complications prior to randomization . 
  
Lutonix BTK Investigational Plan  
Document: CL0005 -01  Revision: 12 
7 Sept 2017  LUTONIX CONFIDENTIAL  Page 40 of 89 Below are 3 possible treatment Scenarios for randomization:  
Scenario 1:  One potential target vessel identified, pre -dilated and meets post -pre-dilatation 
criteria for randomization.  The subject has a single target v essel and is randomized to either the 
Lutonix DCB or Control  PTA; the target vessel is treated with the as -randomized device, as in 
Figure 3.  
Scenario 2:  Two potential target vessels are identified  and pre-dilated , but only one vessel meets 
the post-pre-dilatation criteria for randomization.  The subject has a single target vessel and is 
randomized to either the Lutonix DCB or Control  PTA, as in Figure 3.  The target vessel meeting 
criteria is treated with the as -randomized DCB or control PTA. The  pre-dilated vessel that did 
not meet post -pre-dilatation criteria is NOT a target vessel and is treated per Investigator’s 
standard practice and is NOT treated with the investigational  device . Non -target vessels are 
excluded from all endpoint analyses .  
Scenario 3:  Two potential target vessels are identified  and pre-dilated , and both vessels meet the 
post-pre-dilatation criteria for randomization.  The subject has TWO target vessels and is 
randomized to either the Lutonix DCB or Control  PTA, as in Figure 3. Both vessels MUST be 
treated with the as -randomized device ( the same treatment, either Lutonix DCB or Control  PTA, 
as randomized for that subject). Both target vessels are included in endpoint analyses.  If two 
target vessel  flow pathway s are successfull y identified, attempting treatment of a third is not 
allowed.  
6.6 RANDOMIZATION  
If after pre -dilatation(s) , subjects  are determined to meet the criteria for randomization, they will 
be stratified by Rutherford Class and randomized using a pre -specified site randomization 
system.  Subject s will be randomized in a 2:1 fashion  in each strata to Test ( Lutonix  DCB  
Catheter ) or Control (standard PTA catheter) , and all target lesions in up to two target vessels 
(meeting entry cr iteria) are treated with the as -randomized device.   
 
Any pre -dilated vessel that did not meet angiographic lesion and outflow criteria is NOT a target 
vessel and is NOT treated with the investigational device. Any vessel failing to meet criteria after 
pre-dilatation is instead treated per Investigator’s standard practice.  
 
6.6.1 TREATMENT WITH  STANDARD  PTA  CATHETER (CONTROL ) 
For subjects randomized to the control arm, treatment with an additional standard uncoated PTA 
catheter (control device) is at the discreti on of the investigator.  Control PTA treatment should 
maintain balloon inflation for minimum of 2 minutes.  
 
NOTE: All angioplasty balloons used for vessel pre -dilation or treatment of control arm subjects 
must be uncoated, standard PTA balloons. Balloons that incorporate a contoured  surface, 
Lutonix BTK Investigational Plan  
Document: CL0005 -01  Revision: 12 
7 Sept 2017  LUTONIX CONFIDENTIAL  Page 41 of 89 external wire support, cutting/scoring  component , or other similar modificati ons may NOT be 
used for pre -dilation or control arm treatment.  
Multiple lesions may be treated independently in the one or two pre -specified target vessels with 
control PTA. The total length of treated lesions (in target vessels) should not exceed 320 mm ( for 
consistency with the treatment length limitation in the test arm).   
Pre-dilated vessels that did not meet post -pre-dilatation criteria are not target vessels and are 
treated with PTA or per institutional standard practice  and are excluded from endpoint  analyses . 
 
6.6.2 TREATMENT WITH LUTONIX  DCB  (TEST) 
Please refer to the current Lutonix  DCB  IFU for detailed information on device use.  
The Lutonix  DCB  should extend at least 5 mm proximally and distally of the pre -dilated segment  
or the lesion (whichever is lon ger) in order to avoid geographic miss .  Care should be taken not 
to extend the entire injury segment unnecessarily.  
Multiple lesions may be treated independently in the one or two pre -specified target vessels with 
test devices.  Multiple DCBs may be used;  each balloon may be used only once for adequate 
drug delivery to the vessel wall.  DCBs may be overlapped as necessary to ensure coverage of a 
pre-dilated injury segment or lesion without geographic miss.  The total length of the all DCBs 
used during the procedure is limited to 360 mm.  
 
6.7 POST -TREATMENT  AND  PROVISIONAL  (BAILOUT)  STENTING  PROCEDURES  
The current trial design is intended to minimize the need for bailout stenting , and it is expected 
that stents w ill be used in < 5% of procedures .  Bailout stenting should only be performed if it is 
deemed that a stent is required in order to avoid surgical bypass or amputation after attempting 
prolonged  balloon inflation s and/or nitroglycerin.  
If bailout stenting is necessary , a bare metal ( not drug eluting) stent must be used, since no data 
is available on potential drug interactions and the allowed treatment s must be similar in both 
arms  (the only difference being the as -randomized presence or absence of the drug coating) . The 
physician should use the shortest stent possible to treat only the clinically necessary segment and 
not the e ntire target lesion.  Antiplatelet therapy should be prescribed per the stent 
manufacturer’s IFU .  
Data obtained from bailout stenti ng procedures will be analyzed as per the Statistical  Analysis 
Plan.  
6.8 UNSCHEDULED  ANGIOGRAPHY/REVASCULARIZATION  
A DUS should  be performed prior to any subsequent angiography of the index limb  below the 
knee vessels , and the images should  be submitted to the DUS Core Lab.  Hemodynamic and 
clinical status should  also be evaluated prior to angiography , including Rutherford classification , 
wound status  (including collection of images , if applicable ) and ABI and/or toe pressures.  
 
Lutonix BTK Investigational Plan  
Document: CL0005 -01  Revision: 12 
7 Sept 2017  LUTONIX CONFIDENTIAL  Page 42 of 89 All subseque nt angiograms for the below the knee vessels  (index limb only) should  be forwarded 
to the Angiographic Core Lab for review and analysis.  Attempts should be made to record the 
same views and angles as from the index procedure.  Treatment of any new non -target lesions is 
left to the discretion of the Investigator .  However, use of drug -device combination products (e.g. 
DES or DCB) is not recommended within 90 days of the index procedure .  
  
7 TREATMENT OF SUBJECT  
Lutonix (or its designee) reserves the right to  attend index or follow -up procedures in order to 
ensure  protocol compliance, proper device handling and adequate image capture.  
7.1 BLINDING  PLAN  
In order t o minimize the introduction of bias into the study, a pre -specified blinding plan has 
been developed.  The subject will remain blinded to the treatment until after completion of the 6 
month clinical visit. Members of the Clinical Events Committee (CEC) will be blinded to the 
subject’s treatment assignment.   
At scheduled follow -up visits or interim visits for evaluation of recurrent symptoms, the WIQ 
and EQ -5D should  be completed by the Subject prior to the Investigator evaluation  so as to 
provide the Investigator with patient input prior to the examination .  Blinding procedures will be 
reviewed at the time of each site initiation by a Sponsor representative.   Blinding procedures and 
instructions are as follows:  
  
Lutonix BTK Investigational Plan  
Document: CL0005 -01  Revision: 12 
7 Sept 2017  LUTONIX CONFIDENTIAL  Page 43 of 89  
Time point  Blinding Procedure  
Informed Consent/  
Pre-Procedure  During review of the study and the informed consent process with the 
patient, blinding procedures, timelines and rationale should be discussed 
with the subject and any care takers.  
Randomization  Communication to the Investigator performing the procedure as to the 
randomized treatment should be done in such a way as to prevent the subject 
from overhearing which group they have been allocated to.  Hand signals, 
written codes, scripts or headphones c an all be employed to ensure the 
subject remains blinded.   Each site must develop a system that best works 
with lab work flow.  
Post-Procedure  It is important that recovery and hospital/clinic staff is educated to the 
protocol blinding requirements and th at the subject and care taker are not 
inadvertently unblinded during the recovery period.  In addition, the medical 
record should clearly identify the subject as a study participant and the type 
of treatment should be kept confidential.  
Follow -up The WIQ and EQ -5D should  be completed by the Subject prior to evaluation 
by the investigator.  The clinical status of the subject (for assessment of 
clinical and primary safety endpoints) should be established prior to 
performing the required DUS and angiography (for assessment of the 
primary efficacy endpoint).  
Unblinding  A subject may not become unblinded prior to the completion of the 6 month 
follow up unless it should become medically necessary as determined by the 
investigator.    
7.2 MEDICATIONS  
Table 2 displays the suggested  anticoagulation  medication  regimen for this study  and is 
consistent with standard hospital practice for angioplasty procedures.  All anti-platelet , anti-
coagulant , and cardiovascular related medications administered will be recorded in the subject’s 
medical record  and the appropriat e eCRF.   Anti-platelet therapy labeling and use vary by 
country ; and approved treatments for the Investigational Sites ’ geography should be followed.  It 
is preferred that all subjects be treated with clopidogrel and aspirin for one month, followed by 
aspir in there after throughout the duration study . Prolonged dual antiplatelet therapy may be 
indicated for non -study reasons and is allowed at the investigators discretion.  For subjects on 
chronic Coumadin, it is not required for both aspirin and a P 2Y12 inhibiter be continued for at 
least 1 month; per p rotocol and per standard of care, only a single  agent  (in addition to 
Coumadin) is sufficient once INR is therapeutic. In subjects ≥75 years of age and/or <  60kg, 
prasugrel is generally not recommended because of the increased risk of fatal and intracrania l 
bleeding and uncertain benefit, except in high -risk situations (diabetes or history of prior MI) 
where its effect appears to be greater and its use may be considered.  Always refer to the current 
package insert.

7.2.1 PRE-PROCEDURE  
If the subject  is known to be receiving a stent for a non-target lesion  (i.e. inflow lesion) , it is 
suggested  that 3 days before the intervention clopidogrel (75 mg per day) or prasugrel (10 mg 
per day) be prescribed.  The initial loading dose of clopidogrel or prasugrel should attempt  to be 
started prior to the index procedure, but should  occur no later than 2 h ours after the completion 
of the index procedure.  
 
7.2.2 INTRA -PROCEDURE  
All subject s must receive adequate anticoagulation  according to hospital standard practice.  
It is recommended that subjects  that are already taking daily chronic aspirin therapy should 
receive a  dose of 75-325 mg  aspirin  within 24 hours prior to the index procedure and those 
subjects not already taking daily chronic aspirin therapy should be given at least 300 mg aspirin 
at least 2 hours and preferably 24 hours before the procedure is perfo rmed.  
 
7.2.3 POST-PROCEDURE  
Approved vascular closure devices are allowed.  Dual a nti-platelet medication should be 
prescribed for at least 1 month, unless a stent is placed, in which case anti -platelet therapy should 
be prescribed per the stent manufacturer’s IFU , or the subject is on chronic Coumadin, in which 
case one agent should be discontinued after the INR is therapeutic .  Updated guidelines will be 
implemented via note -to-file if changes in the recommended doses occur.

The initial baseline DUS must be performed after the index procedure at the 30 day visit and 
again at 6 , 12, 24 and 36  months .  Since DUS is critical to assessing study endpoints, the quality 
of this test is extremely important , and DUS should be performed prior to angiography  (if 
necessary) .  The Core Labs will be closely monitoring the quality of all incoming images for 
compliance.  Sites should ensure that only DUS operators who are trained on the DUS guidelines 
are performin g these tests.  Refer to the Duplex Ultrasound Guidelines Manual of Operations for 
the most current version of the documentation requirements.   See Appendix H for detailed core 
lab guidelines.  
7.3.1.7  ANGIOGRAPHY GUIDELINES  
Initial baseline  angiograms should be performed at the time of procedure .  All angiograms 
should  be submitted to the core laboratory as soon after the case as possible.  Refer to the 
Angiography Guidelines Manual of Operations for the most current version of the documentation 
requirements.   See Appendix G for detailed core lab guidelines.

7 Sept 2017  LUTONIX CONFIDENTIAL  Page 47 of 89 7.3.1.8  WOUND HEALING ASSESSMENT  
Wound healing assessments must be performed at the pre -procedure, 30 day, 6, 12, 24 and 36 
month clinical visits  of the target limb .  Photographs of the wound must be taken to document 
wound healing progression at each clinical visit . 
Wound  healing assessment s will be recorded  on the appropriate eCRF as healed  (complete ly 
epithelializ ed), not healed, or amputated.  In addition, if the wound is not healed, wound 
progression will be recorded  on the eCRF as improving, stagnant, or worsening  and a photograph 
of any wounds  must be taken and  placed in the subject’s study chart for reference at each visit.  
Note:  Sites must have a wound care process /program  in place for patients participating in the 
study.  Follow -up wound care for patients can be conducted at the site’s affiliated wound care 
center or equivalent wound care facility.   
7.3.2 FOLLOW -UP PROCEDURES  
All randomized subjects will return for follow -up at 30 days , 6, 12, 24 and 36  months  post-
procedure.   See Table 3 for required testing at each follow -up visit time point.  Refer to Section 
7.1 Blinding Plan for specifics on maintaining the blind during the follow -up visits.   
 
Subject s will be instructed to report adverse events to their study physician between evaluation 
visits.  
Anti-platelet, anti -coagulant, and c ardiovascular medicatio ns will be recorded on the eCRF.  
Anti-platelet therapy compliance including dose, periods of interruption (and reason for 
interruption), and invasive procedures deterred due to the need to take anti -platelet therapy will 
also be recorded on the eCRF.  
 
8 ADV ERSE  EVENTS  
An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a subject.  This 
definition does not imply that there is a relationship between the adverse event and the device 
under investigation.  The following will be adjudicated by t he CEC:   all stroke events, all Major 
Adverse Cardiovascular Events (MACE)  which includes stroke, Myocardial Infarctions, and 
death (all cause) , all target limb related events, and  all device - and / or procedure -related AE s. 
See Appendix A for detailed AE  definitions.  
8.1 ADVERSE  EVENT  REPORTING  
All adverse events occurring since the start of the study procedure must be recorded in the eCRF. 
All adverse events occurring in this study will be classified in accordance with the adverse event 
signs or symptoms.  Any Serious Adverse Event must be reported in the EDC within 5 working 
days of knowledge.  All adverse events must be reported to the IRB /EC per local requirements.

7 Sept 2017  LUTONIX CONFIDENTIAL  Page 48 of 89 9 SUBJECT  WITHDRAWAL  CRITERIA  
Subject s can withdraw from the study at any time  for any reason ; the reason for withdrawal will 
be documented.  All data available at the time of withdrawal (if any) will be used for analysis. 
There will be no further follow -up (per this study protocol) on the subject  who has withdrawn.  
Subject s who withdraw from the study will not be replaced, however loss -to-follow -up has been 
considered for sample size statistics.  
If a visit is missed, the site is  required to document a minimum of three (3) attempts to contact 
the subject within the follow -up window.  If the subject only misses one protocol required visit, 
the site should repeat the three (3) attempts to contact the subject followed by a certified letter.  
When a subject misses two (2) consecutive follow -up visits with failure of all contact attempts, 
the subject may then be considered lost to follow up and exited from the study.

Lutonix  DCB  Catheters  upon completion of the protocol requirements for study initiation.  
Additional training a nd support will be provided on an ongoing basis.  
For re -supply of Lutonix  DCB  Catheters , the site is to contact  Lutonix  or its designee.  
 
12 STUDY  MANAGEMENT  
 
12.1 ADVISORY COMMITTEE  
The Advisory Committee (AC) will meet as needed by conference or teleconference to monitor 
enrollment, clinical site progress, and protocol compliance.  The specific tasks of the AC are to:  
• Act upon recommendations of the Data Monitoring Committee  
• Resolve problems in cooperation with  the Clinical Trial Manager  
• Sole discretion for stopping or otherwise modifying the study based on clinical data 
collected  
• Provide publication policy  
The Advisory Committee may be comprised  of representatives from Lutonix, the Principal 
Investigators , core lab directors  and selected physicians  representing Interventional Cardiology 
and Vascular Surgery specialties.    
12.2 DATA  MONITORING  COMMITTEE  
The Data Monitoring Committee (DMC)  is responsibl e for the oversight and safety monitoring 
of the study .  The DMC advises the Sponsor regarding the continuing safety of the trial subjects 
and those yet to be recruited to the trial, as well as the continuing validity and scientific merit of 
the trial.  The DMC  members are leading experts in peripheral vascular disease, cardiovascular 
medicine  and biostatistics who are not participating in the trial and have no affiliation with 
Lutonix.  
During the enrollment phase of the trial, the DMC  will review accumulating safety data to 
monitor for incidence of serious vascular events that would warrant mo dification or termination 
of the trial.  
The DMC  will meet at regular intervals to review the safety data.   DMC  responsibilities, 
membership, meeting frequencies , and procedures will be outlined in the DMC  charter.  
12.3   CLINICAL  EVENTS  COMMITTEE  
The Clinical E vents Committee ( CEC ) will consist  of a minimum of three clinicians with 
expertise in vascular intervention and who are not participants in the study  or members of the 
Lutonix BTK Investigational Plan  
Document: CL0005 -01  Revision: 12 
7 Sept 2017  LUTONIX CONFIDENTIAL  Page 52 of 89 SC.  The members of the CEC  will be blinded to the subject ’s treatment.  The CEC  is char ged 
with the development of specific criteria used for the categorization of clinical events and 
clinical endpoints in the study which are based on the protocol.  
At the onset of the trial, the CEC will establish explicit rules outlining the minimum amount  of 
data required in order to classify a clinical event.   All members of the CEC will be blinded to the 
primary results of the trial.  The CEC will review and adjudicate the following events:  all stroke 
events, all Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events (MACE)  which includes strokes, Myocardial 
Infarctions, and death (all cause) , all target limb related events, , and all device - and / or procedure -
related AEs.   Reportable AEs do NOT include dissection (Grade A or B) which do not requ ire 
intervention, because dissection is an expected outcome of the angioplasty procedure and will be 
reported by the angiography core lab based on the Grade A -F (National Heart, Lung, and Blood 
Institute Dissection Classification System).   
   
13 REGULATORY  RESPONSIBILITIES

to initial submission to the IRB/EC; major changes must be approved by the FDA.  
The study must be explained in a language that is understandable to the subject  and he/she must 
be allowed sufficient time to decide whether to participate. All subject s will be assured that they 
have the right to withdraw from the study at any time during the course of the protocol and this 
decision will not influence his/her relationship  with the Investigator  (treating physician) and/or 
study staff.  
13.4   SELECTION  OF CLINICAL  SITES  AND  INVESTIGATORS  
Lutonix  will select Investigator s who are qualified and experienced to participate in  the 
investigation of the study devices.   Sites will be se lected based upon a review  of a recent site 
assessment and the qualifications of the (primary) Investigator (s) at  the site.  Investigator s must  
submit a current  curriculum vitae (CV)  as part of the qualification process . 
All Investigator s must be approved by the Sponsor  prior to participation in the study.  
Any site  that becomes deactivated by the Sponsor or by the individual site itself prior to first site 
enrollment  will be replaced.  
Due to the potential for an imbalance in the randomization ratio from low enrolling sites, any site 
not able to enroll a subject within 2 months (60 days) of formal initiation may be replaced.  The 
Sponsor will proactively be tracking site -based enrollment  throughout the study and may 
implement enrollment restrictions to assist in balanced enrollment across sites.  
13.5   INVESTIGATOR’S  RESPONSIBILITIES  
Each  Investigator  is responsible for ensuring the investigation is conducted according to all 
signed agreements , the Investigational Plan and applicable laws and regulations.  The site 
Principal Investigator will select qualified co -investigators at each site  and will maintain 
responsibility for oversight of all procedures and data collection.  All co -Investigators  must be 
trained on all aspects of the protocol prior to enrolling and performing procedures.  All 
interv entionalists performing procedures must be trained as co -investigators in the study.

Investigator s.  No submissions may be made without the written approval from Lutonix .    
 
15 STATISTICAL  ANALYSIS PLAN  
The Lutonix BTK Trial is a global, multi -center,  randomized , controlled  clinical trial comparing 
the Lutonix DCB Catheter to standard PTA for the treatment of stenosis or occlusion of below -
the-knee arteries.  The primary effectiveness will consider analyses of all vessels and proximal 
vessels only.   Up to 1000 subjects may be enrolled  to obtain up to the maximum of 840 treated 
vessels  at up to 75 global centers. The study sample size will be determined  using  a Bayesian 
decision making method that evaluates  the predicted probability of a significant primary 
effective ness result  at the full planned sample size to assess futility  and at the existing  enrollment 
to assess if the current sample size provides sufficient power .  Assessment  for predicted 
probability for futility and success  will be performed when the 400 th, 500 th, 600 th, and 700 th 
vessel s are treated .  If the study  enrollment  is not ended  at the  700 vessel evaluation, the study 
will continue to enroll until 840 vessels are treated .  Subject  randomization will be allocate d 2:1 
Lutonix DCB (test arm) to standard PTA catheter (control arm) after successful pre -dilatation  
and all vessels within a subject will receive the same therapy .  US and non -US enrollment will be 
contemporaneously monitored throughout the study to ensure  at least 50% of randomized 
subjects occur at US sites.  
Subjects are considered enrolled in the study after being consented and the defined pre -dilatation 
balloon inflation has begun.  Based on angiographic results after pre -dilatation, some subjects 
will not meet criteria for randomization, and these nonrandomized patients are followed only for 
safety and do not contribute to the required sample size of 840 treated vessels .  However, since 
Lutonix BTK Investigational Plan  
Document: CL0005 -01  Revision: 12 
7 Sept 2017  LUTONIX CONFIDENTIAL  Page 56 of 89 the patient underwent a protocol def ined pre -dilatation, they are considered to be enrolled even 
though they are not randomized.  
Successful pre-dilatation  is defined as operator determination that procedural success may be 
achievable using angioplasty alone, ≤50% residual stenosis of the tar get lesion,  and 
reconstitution of the target vessel above the ankle with patent in -line flow from the target lesion 
to below -ankle outflow.   Subjects with a target vessel meeting these criteria  are randomized .  
Subjects who do not meet post -pre-dilatation  lesion  success  criteria  are not randomized and are 
instead treated per hospital standard  practice,  followed for safety for 30 days , and then 
withdrawn.  Subject s who are enrolled and randomized will be followed clinically for 6 months 
to assess the primar y efficacy endpoint  with further follow -up extending out to 3 years.  
The primary analysis is based on  a repeated -measures  logistic model of vessel success that 
includes treatment and a subject random effect  using  available data from all randomized subjects 
on an intent -to-treat basis.  Safety endpoints are assessed per subject and efficacy endpoints per 
target vessel.  For the  study to be considered successful, superiority of Lutonix DCB  Catheter 
must be demonstrated for the primary efficacy endpoint, non -inferiority of the Lutonix DCB  
Catheter  must be demonstrated for the primary safety endpoint , and Lutonix DCB Catheter must 
meet the performance goal of the powered secondary safety endpoint .  Secondary time -to-event 
analyses will also be conducted.  
As the study includes interim assessments of the sample size, the primary effectiveness analysis 
includes an adjustment to the significance level used in the final analysis  in order to maintain the 
overall Type I error level of the study .  Section 15. 3.2 provides details of the primary 
effectiveness analysis.  Appendix J provides complete details on the operating characteristics o f 
the adaptive study design.   
 
15.1   ASSESSMENT  OF COMPARABILITY  OF TREATMENT  GROUPS  AND  
POOLABILITY  OF SITES  AND  SECONDARY  ANALYSES  
To demonstrate the comparability of the Control to Test subjects, the samples will be compared 
using t -tests or nonparametric Wilcoxon rank sum tests for means and X2-tests for proportions: 
age, gender, smoking, obesity,  dyslipidemia,  hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, diabetes 
mellitus, vessels treated, total target  lesion length  and maximum percent stenosis of the target 
lesio n (via core lab analysis) , previous target lesion intervention,  target limb  hemodynamics , and 
Rutherford grade.   
All primary endpoints will also be presented by site, and the sites will be tested for differences in 
the endpoints.  Sites with  3 or fewer randomized subjects will be combined for this purpose.     
An analysis will be performed to examine the potential for interaction of site and treatment 
group.   A mixed effects logistic regression model will be fit that includes a fixed effect for 
treatment g roup, and random effects for individual, site, and the interaction of treatment group 
Lutonix BTK Investigational Plan  
Document: CL0005 -01  Revision: 12 
7 Sept 2017  LUTONIX CONFIDENTIAL  Page 57 of 89 and site.  If the p -value for the interaction term variance component is <0.15 , it will  be 
considered evidence of a statistically significant interaction effect, and additional analyses will 
be performed to explore the differences between sites to assess their potential causes and whether 
or not they are clinically meaningful.   The random ef fect for individuals will  accommodate the 
potential for correlation between observations for subjects with two treated pathways.  
All primary endpoints will also be presented by geography (US versus OUS).  An analysis will 
be performed to examine the potent ial for interaction of geography and treatment group.  A 
logistic regression model will be fit that includes fixed effects for treatment group, geography, 
and the interaction of treatment group and geography.  If the p -value for the interaction term is 
<0.15, it will be considered evidence of a statistically significant interaction effect, and 
additional analyses will be performed to explore the differences between geographies to assess 
their potential causes and whether or not they are clinically meaningfu l.  The model will also 
include a random effect for individual to accommodate the potential for correlation between 
observations for subjects with two treated pathways.  
In addition, a descriptive analysis that examines the impact of important covariates on  study 
results will be performed. Baseline covariates include age, gender, smoking, obesity, 
dyslipidemia , hypertension, diabetes mellitus, vessels treated, total target lesion length, and 
maximum percent stenosis of the target lesion (via core lab analysi s), previous target lesion 
intervention, target limb  hemodynamics , and Rutherford grade.  A binary assessment of target 
limb hemodynamics will also include an evaluation of whether the subject had an ankle pressure 
≤ 70 mm Hg, toe pressure ≤ 50 mg, TCP02 ≤  50, or non -pulsatile metatarsal/toe PVR are 
document.  These covariates at a minimum will be included along with treatment group in a 
logistic regression model in order to understand their potential impact on study results and to 
account for chance imbala nces between the randomized groups.  
To assess the consistency of results under different analyses, secondary as -treated (AT) and per -
protocol (PP) analyses may be performed for the primary and secondary endpoints.  The AT 
dataset will include only those su bjects treated with either an investigational or control device, 
and the comparison will be based on the actual device used, not randomized assignment.  The PP 
dataset will include all randomized subjects that are characterized by appropriate exposure to 
treatment (procedurally correct as pre -specified), and the absence of major protocol violations 
including violations of entry criteria.  An additional supportive analysis of patients with and 
without bailout stenting will also be performed based on descript ive statistics, and data will 
further be presented for PP analysis of subjects with and without bailout stenting.  It is expected 
that 5% or less of randomized subjects will receive a bail -out stent.  
15.2    HANDLING  OF MISSING  DATA  
Endpoints may be missing beca use subjects have died , have un -interpretable imaging data  or 
have withdrawn from the study prior to the time the endpoint is measured.  The reason  for the 
censoring of all subjects with missing endpoints will be reported . A tipping -point analysis will be 
Lutonix BTK Investigational Plan  
Document: CL0005 -01  Revision: 12 
7 Sept 2017  LUTONIX CONFIDENTIAL  Page 58 of 89 performed for each primary endpoint, in addition to the standard analysis , in which assumptions 
about missing data are varied from worst -case to best -case to examine at what point the missing 
data would alter the results of the analysis.   In addition, a multiple imputation analysis will be 
performed using available results and baseline variables identified for the assessment of 
poolability in Section 15.1.  This set of analyses  will constitute sensitivity analyses of the effect 
of missing data on the study results.  
Secondary analyses  will also be conducted  using survival analysis techniques  (Kaplan -Meier 
estimates) , wherein unobserved endpoints are a  standard part of the analysis; they are known as 
“censored observations”.  As long as the censoring is unrelated to the treatment, this method of 
handling missing endpoints produces unbiased estimates of the freedom -from -event rates.  
15.3    PRIMARY  ENDPOINTS  
Primary Safety Endpoint  
The primary safety endpoint is a composite of freedom from BTK MALE + POD at 30 Days . 
This is defined as freedom from the composite of all -cause death, above -ankle amputation or 
major  reintervention (new bypass graft, jump/interposition graft revision, or 
thrombectomy/thrombolysis) of the index limb involving a below -the-knee  artery . Thes e events 
are called “safety events” in the following text.   
Primary Efficacy Endpoint  
The primary efficacy endpoint is a composite of limb salvage and primary patency at 6 Months. 
This is defined as freedom from the composite of above ankle amputation, tar get lesion  
occlusion, and clinically -driven target lesion reintervention. These events are called “efficacy 
events” in the following text.  
 
15.3.1    PRIMARY SAFETY ENDPOINT : BACKGROUND CONSIDERATIONS & OUTCOME 
EXPECTATIONS  
 
Standard of care is surgical bypass or percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA), and a 
difference between arms cannot be expected at the early time point of 30 days.  
 
Two recent meta -analyses10,11 report 30 day data for elements of the composite safety endpoint  
(“safety events”) .  Conte et  al. report ed 2.8% deaths  and 6.1% MALE.  It is unknown how much 
subject overlap there may be in these endpoints (cumulatively 8.9%, if none ). Similarly, Romiti 
et al. reported 6.6% amputations and 1.8% death within 30 days along with 37/1743 = 2.1% 
thromboses and 17/1743 = 0.98% emboli. It is unknown how much subject overlap there may be 
in these endpoints (cumulatively 11.5% , if none ); also reported were 22/1743 = 1.3% non -
amputation surgeries . Both meta -analyses demonstrate a similar failure rate  ≤ 9 to 11%. As an 
estimate accounting for subject overlap, a 9% incidence of safety events is assumed for the 
purpose of power calculations.

15.3.2  PRIMARY SAFETY ENDPOINT :  HYPOTHESES AND SAMPLE SIZE CALCULATION  
Objective :  To assess whether the proportion of subjects free from any safety event* in the Test 
group is inferior or not inferior to that of Control group through  30-days post-index procedure.  
H0: The proportion of subjects free from safety events in the Test group through 30-days 
post-index procedure i s clinically inferior to that of the Control group.  
H1: The proportion of subjects free from safety events in  the Test group through 30-days 
post-index procedure is clinically non-inferior to that of the Control group.  
H0: φCONTROL   – φTEST  ≥       vs.    H 1: φCONTROL   – φTEST < ** 
*All-cause death, above -ankle amputation, or major  reintervention (new bypass graft, 
jump/interposition graft revision, or thrombectomy/thrombolysis) of the index limb involving a 
below -the-knee artery  are safety events . **δ is the margin of noninferiority.  
The statistical analysis will be a Farrington & Manning test for non -inferiority of proportions ; the 
test will be a one -sided test at α=0.025.  The response variable  in each subject  will be the 
presence or absence of at least one safety event  from the time  following the index procedure  
through 30-days.  The primary analysis will be the dataset of all randomized subjects ITT  based 
on either all subjects and subjects with one or more proximal vessel as indicated by the primary 
effectiveness analysis outcome (refer to Section 15.3.4) , and a significant reje ction of the null 
hypothesis with one -sided p -value less than 0.025 indicates success for this endpoint.  In addition 
to the primary analysis, secondary as -treated analyses and per -protocol analyses will also be 
reported.  
The proportions  at 30-days post-index procedure, and the confidence intervals of these rates in 
each group, will also be reported.  
Sample Size Estimate :  The sample size estimate assumed the following : 
• The true 30-days proportion  in the Test group is 100% - 9% = 91%.  The true 30-days 
proportion  in the Control group is 100% - 9% = 91%. 
• A 2:1 randomization ratio . 
• Farrington & Manning test for non -inferiority of proportions.  
• The Type 1 error,  = 0.025 (one -sided).  
• The Type 2 error,  = 0.10 (Power = 1 -  = 90%). 
• The non -inferiority margin, δ= 0.12. 
• Subjects who are censored without having an event  will be omitted from the analysis.  
 
According to PASS 2008 (using the Farrington and Manning test for non -inferiority of 
proportions ), the evaluable sample size required  for 90% power is 254 (85 Control plus 169 
Test).   
Lutonix BTK Investigational Plan  
Document: CL0005 -01  Revision: 12 
7 Sept 2017  LUTONIX CONFIDENTIAL  Page 60 of 89 Based on the  minimum  study  sample size of 400 treated vessels and assuming 1.15 vessels per 
subject, the study should include approximately 350 subjects.   A llowing for 10% drop-out, the 
study is expected to provide at least 313 evaluable subjects and will provide more than 90% 
power.  Hence the safety endpoi nt is not a driver of the sample size of the study.  
 
15.3.3    PRIMARY EFFICACY ENDPOINT : BACKGROUND CONSIDERATIONS & OUTCOME 
EXPECTATIONS  
Although the unmet clinical need is significant, there is little data from well -designed, 
randomized, controlled studies that  compare the outcomes of different treatment modalities. The 
primary efficacy endpoint is a composite of limb salvage and primary patency at 6 months, 
defined as freedom from the composite of above ankle amputation, target lesion  occlusion, and 
clinically -driven target lesion reintervention.   
Standard of care is surgical bypass or PTA .  For PTA  recent meta -analyses10 report 6 month  limb 
salvage rates of 8 8.2% and overall 6 month  survival rates of 92.3%. Since Rutherford Class 6 
patients are excluded in the present study, a slightly lower amputation rate o f 10% is assumed for 
both arms.  
 
One or two flow pathways are allowed as target vessel( s); i.e., peroneal or posterior tibial arteries 
may involve tibioperoneal trunk lesions and tibial arteries may involve popliteal lesions.  
Multiple lesions in up to two target vessels may be treated. All target vessels are identified prior 
to randomization. Failure of efficacy requires amputation or total occlusion (no flow through the 
flow pathway), independent of the number of target lesions, and therefore the sample si ze for 
testing of the efficacy endpoint is the number of treated vessels.  If an upstream  treated segment  
included in two otherwise distinct flow pathways fails (e.g., the treated popliteal artery fails in a 
subject with both AT and PT  as treated  target vessels ), then at least one target vessel fails. Both 
target vessels fail if n either of the two distal branches (e.g., the AT or PT) can be demonstrated 
to be open . However,  if one or both distal branches  are demonstrated to be open (e.g., the AT or 
PT are open, filled by collaterals around an occluded popliteal) , then only a single  target vessel  
(1 of 2) is considered to have failed  for purposes of efficacy endpoint  analyses .  Doppler -
demonstrated antegrade flow through the target vessel is considered a patency and primary 
efficacy endpoint success (in subjects without an amputation or clinically -driven TLR), even if 
angiography was refused.   
Preliminary randomized a nd registry data has been reported for another manufacturer’s DCB 
(Medtronic/Invatec’s Amphirion In.Pact). In the DEBATE BTK study, n = 92 subjects were 
randomized to DCB or PTA16. Multiple infrapopliteal vessels were treated in 28% (26/92) of 
subjects (118 infrapopliteal lesions in 92 subjects), with concomitant treatment of inflow vessels 
(SFA in 33% and popliteal in 18%).  After 12 months, there w ere no major amputations in either 
arm; deaths included 7% (3/44) for DCB vs. 10% (5/49) for control, and the re -occlusion rate 
was 16% for DCB vs. 52% for control PTA. Consecutive Leipzig registries19,20 demonstrate a 
Lutonix BTK Investigational Plan  
Document: CL0005 -01  Revision: 12 
7 Sept 2017  LUTONIX CONFIDENTIAL  Page 61 of 89 similar benefit for single -arm, open -label DCB over historic PTA, with 3 month angiographic 
occlusion rate of 9.5% for DCB (n = 104) compared to 37.6% for control PTA (n = 50).  
A beneficial treatment effect difference of 36% at 1 year was observed in the randomized study , 
and a difference of 28% at 3 months was observed in co nsecutive registries.  
In the LEVANT 2 randomized study (pivotal study for the Lutonix DCB in SFA), the o bserved 
primary patency rate was 81.2% (DCB test) vs. 64.8% % (PTA control) at 6 months for beneficial 
treatment effect difference of 16.4%. 
Given that the Lutonix DCB with the same Lutonix drug coating is used in this trial as was used 
in the LEVANT 2 stud y, the treatment effect of  at least  15% benefit for test DCB is assumed for 
the difference in total occlusion rate for the purpose of power calculations.  
Together with the 10% expected amputation rate, the expected composite primary endpoint 
success rate 55% for test DCB and 40% for control is assumed  for power calculations .  
15.3.4  PRIMARY EFFICACY ENDPOINT : HYPOTHESIS AND SAMPLE SIZE 
 
Objective :  To assess whether the proportion of target vessels free from any efficacy event * in the 
Control group is less than or not to that of the Test group through 6-months post -index procedure.    
The primary effectiveness analysis will be performed in a staged fashion by evaluating all vessels  
for significance and, if that does not reach significance, then the analysis will be completed for 
only proximal vessels.  The  levels for the overall and p roximal vessels analyses have been 
adjusted to ensure the overall study preserves a one -sided Type I error rate of less than or equal to 
0.025.  The study will be considered to have demonstrated effectiveness for all subjects if the all 
vessels analysis re aches significance and for proximal vessels in the event only the proximal vessel 
analysis reaches the significance level.   
For each analysis, all vessels and proximal vessels, t he treatment effect will be estimated via a 
repeated measures logistic regres sion model, with random effects to account for correlation 
within subjects. The logistic regression model takes the form:  
 log(𝑝𝑖𝑗
1−𝑝𝑖𝑗)=𝛼+𝛾𝑖+𝛽𝑡𝑖𝑗 (1) 
 𝑋𝑖𝑗~Bern (𝑝𝑖𝑗) 
 where 𝑋𝑖𝑗 is a Bernoulli random variable for 6 -month success (1=success, 0=failure) for patient 
𝑖 and vessel 𝑗 (𝑗=1,2); 𝑝𝑖𝑗 is the failure -free (success) rate for patient 𝑖 and vessel 𝑗; 𝛼 is the log 
odds of success (failure -free) for patients in the contr ol group; 𝛽 is the increment in log odds of 
success for patients in the treatment group; 𝑡𝑖𝑗 is an indicator variable equal to 1 if in treatment 
group and 0 if in control group; and 𝛾𝑖~𝑁(0,𝜏) is a random intercept for patient 𝑖 that follows a 
Lutonix BTK Investigational Plan  
Document: CL0005 -01  Revision: 12 
7 Sept 2017  LUTONIX CONFIDENTIAL  Page 62 of 89 norm al distribution with mean 0 and variance 𝜏. The parameter 𝜏 represents the between -subject 
variance of response. The model is fitted using restricted maximum likelihood methods (REML); 
hence the primary analysis is not Bayesian and does not depend on any  prior distributions.  
The hypothesis test for superiority is the following:  
 𝐻0:  𝛽≤0 (2) 
 𝐻1:  𝛽>0 
The experimental treatment will be determined superior to control if the one -sided p -value of the 
above hypothesis is less than or equal to 0. 0085.  This cut -off will be applied to the all vessels  
analysis and, if that is not significant, the cut -off will be applied to the proximal vessel populatoin.  
The cut -off of 0. 0085 is selected to control the overall Type I error of the adaptive desig n below 
0.025 under the trial’ s design assumptions as well as planned sensitivities to those assumptions , as 
detailed in Appendix J . 
This analysis will be based on an ITT population with available results.  Sensitivity analyses are 
included in Section 15.2 above.  
In addition to the primary analysis, secondary as -treated analyses and per -protocol analyses will 
also be reported but may not be the basis of labeling claims.  
The proportions at 6-months post -index procedure, and the confidence intervals of these rates in 
each group, will also be reported.  
The sample size was selected based on simulation work that demonstrated  that a maximum 
possible sample size of 840 treated vessels and prevalence rates of proximal vessels of 55%, 
70%, and 80%.  The analysis approach provide s power of at least  0.902 at the assumed response 
rates of 40.0% in the PTA arm and 5 5% in the DCB arm  allowing for 15% drop -out depending 
upon the rate of proximal vessels .  If the PTA and DCB rates are both 40%, then the design 
achieves a power of  no more than  0.0236 and an average sample of no more than  542 vessels  
allowing for 15% drop -out depending upon the prevalence rate of proximal vessels .  Hence, the 
design preserves the study -wide  0.025 one -sided Type I error rate for the staged  effectiven ess 
analys es of all vessels and proximal vessels only . Additional calculations for power and Type I 
error for various scenarios are provided via simulation in Appendix J.  
15.4  INTERIM ANALYSIS  
Interim evaluations will be performed  at the time  400, 500, 600, and 700 vessels  have been 
treated .  A Bayesian decision process will be used to adjust the finalize sample size for the study.  
At each interim analysis , the study will either continue to enroll subjects or enrollment will be 
considered com plete.     If the study is not complete at the 700 vessel interim analysis, the study 
will enroll the full 840 vessels .   The study analysis of results will be performed once the all of 
the enrolled subjects has completed their 6 month assessment.  The sole  objective of the interim 
evaluation is to identify the study sample size.    
 
Lutonix BTK Investigational Plan  
Document: CL0005 -01  Revision: 12 
7 Sept 2017  LUTONIX CONFIDENTIAL  Page 63 of 89 Interim analys es will evaluate for predictive probability  (based on current enrollment)  and 
futility (based on full sample size enrollment of 840) for  superiority for e ffectiveness in the 1) all 
vessels population  or 2) subgroup of proximal vessel  population (see Figure 6 for definition of 
proximal vessel ).  Interi m decision rules based on these analyses are the following:  
1. If predictive probability for success is shown  to be greater than 0.9  for either the all 
vessels population  or the proximal vessel  subgroup , the accrual is stopped and full 
follow -up will be obser ved and final analysis for success will take place  (all vessels 
analysis, followed by proximal vessel s analysis if all vessels analysis does not meet success 
criteria) . 
2. If futility ( predictive probability  < 0.01) is shown for both the all vessels  population  and 
the proximal vessel  subgroup, then accrual is stopped for futility.  
3. If futility is shown for the all vessels population but not for the proximal vessel  subgroup, 
enrollment continues for the proximal vessel  population only for any future next interim  
analysis.  This is referred to as the ‘ proximal vessel  only’ arm of the trial.   All subsequent 
interims and final analysis will only evaluate hypothesis corresponding to the proximal 
vessel  population only.  
4. If none of the above criteria are met, t he trial continues enrolling to the next interim 
analysis or the maximum sample size of 840.  If the maximum sample size of 840 vessels 
is enrolled then the de fined primary analysis ( all vessels analysis, followed by proximal 
vessel s analysis if all vessel s analysis does not meet success criteria) occurs 6 months 
after the 840th vessel is enrolled.  
 
This approach is detailed in Appendix J. 
 
15.5   ADDITIONAL  ANALYSES  
To assess the consistency of results under different analyses, secondary as -treated (AT) and per-
protocol (PP) analyses will be performed for the primary and secondary endpoints.  The AT 
dataset will include only those subjects treated with either an investigational or control device, 
and the comparison will be based on the actual device used, not  randomized assignment.  The PP 
dataset will include all subjects in the full analysis dataset that are characterized by appropriate 
exposure to treatment (procedurally correct as pre -specified), availability of measurements, and 
the absence of major proto col violations including violations of entry criteria.  An additional 
supportive analysis of patients with and without bailout stenting will also be performed based on 
descriptive statistics, and data will further be presented for PP analysis of subjects w ith and 
without bailout stenting. It is expected that 5% or less of randomized subjects will receive a bail -
out stent.  
In addition to the primary proportion based analyses, secondary time -to-event analyses will also be 
conducted.  
 
15.6    OTHER  SECONDARY ENDPOI NTS WITH HYPOTHESIS TESTING  
The following secondary endpoints will be evaluated with hypothesis tests.  To control for 
multiplicity, n o secondary endpoints will be tested unless both primary objectives  and the 
powered secondary performance goal objective are successful. The testing of the following 
Lutonix BTK Investigational Plan  
Document: CL0005 -01  Revision: 12 
7 Sept 2017  LUTONIX CONFIDENTIAL  Page 64 of 89 secondary objectives  will be performed in a hierarchical fashion in the order in which they are 
listed below.  This means that as soon as a null hypothesis is not rejected , no further hypotheses 
will be tested.  This hierarchical testing scheme ensures that the study -wide Type 1 error rate is 
0.05 when all of the secondary endpoints are tested at α  = 0.05.   The secondary analysis will only 
be tested in all vessels or all proximal vessels depending upon the outcom e of the primary 
effectiveness analysis.

Control  group is greater than that in the Test group through 6-months post -index procedure.  
H0: The proportion of target vessels with a  clinically -driven TLR in the Control group 
through 6-months post -index procedure is less than or equal to that of the Test

15.6.4  SECONDARY ENDPOINT :  COMPOSITE EVENTS AT 6 MONTHS  
Objective :  To assess whether the proportion of subjects free from a “composite event” in the 
index limb  is higher in the Test group than in the Control group at 6 months. A “composite 
event” is defined as an a bove -ankle amputation, unhealed wound, ischemic rest pain, target 
vessel occlusion, and clinically -driven TVR .   
H0: The proportion of subjects free f rom any “composite event” in the Test group at 6 -
months is equal to or lower than that in the Control group.

H0: P4TEST ≤  P4CONTROL     vs.    H 1: P4TEST  > P4CONTROL  
The statistical analysis will be  a Z-test for binomial proportions ; the test will be a one-sided test 
at α=0.05.  The response variable  for each target vessel will be the presence or absence of a 
“composite event” at 6 months .  
For clarity, any above -ankle amputation, target vessel occlusion, and clinically -driven TVR are 
counted as a “composite event” whether it occurred prior to or during the 6 -month follow -up

follow -up visit.  I.e., an unhealed wound at a 1 month clinical follow -up visit that is healed 
(completely epithelialized) at 6 months is NOT counted as a “composite event” at 6 months. 
Subjects withou t 6-month clinical follow -up are censored.     
The proportions at 6 -months post -index procedure, and the confidence intervals of these rates in 
each group, will be  reported . 
 
15.7 SECONDARY ENDPOINTS WITH DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS  
The following secondary endpoints will have descriptive statistics estimated.  For each endpoint, 
the estimated mean and standard deviation or proportion and sample size  will be calculated  and 
reported  for the Control group and for the Test group.   Any target pathway or vessel based 
analys is will be completed with repeated measures models adjusted for the potential for repeated 
observations within a subject.   (NOTE:  Some of these endpoints are also tested endpoints ; these 
were presented above) .  In addition to the primary analysis  based on  all randomized subjects , 
descriptive statistics will also be estimated for the primary endpoints and for each of the 
following secondary endpoint s based on as -treated  (AT)  and per -protocol (PP) analyses.  In 
addition, descriptive statistics will also be e stimated for the subsets of subjects with and without 
bailout stenting  and for patients in the PP dataset with and without bailout stenting .

Adverse Event  
An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a subject.  This 
definition does not imply that there is a relationship between the adverse event and the device 
under investigation.   
Adverse Device Effect  
An adverse device effect i s any untoward and unintended response to a medical device.  This 
definition includes any event resulting from insufficiencies or inadequacies in the instructions for 
use for preparation or deployment of the device.  It also includes any event that is a re sult of a 
user error.  
Anticipated Adverse Event  
Any undesirable health related experience occurring to a subject whether or not considered 
related to the investigational product(s) or drug regimen prescribed as part of the protocol, 
predefined in the prot ocol and/or Instruction s For Use (IFU) that is identified or worsens during 
a clinical study.  
Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
An SAE is an adverse event with one of the following outcomes:   
• Death  
• Life-threatening  
o The patient was at substantial risk of dying a t the time of the adverse event . 
• Hospitalization (initial or prolonged)  
o Admission  to the hospital or prolongation of hospitalization was a result of the 
adverse event.  
• Disability or Permanent Damage  
o The adverse event resulted in a significant, persi stent or permanent change, 
impairment, damage or disruption in the patient's body function/structure, 
physical activities and/or quality of life.  
• Required Intervention to Prevent Permanent Impairment or Damage  
• Medical or surgical intervention was necessary to preclude permanent impairment of 
a body function, or prevent permanent damage to a body structure, either situation 
suspected to be due to th e use of the Investigational Device  
 
Serious Adverse Device Effect (SADE)  
An untoward medical occurrence that happens in a subject, is related to the  investigational 
device, and is serious, but is not unanticipated. Untoward medical occurrences that are no t

7 Sept 2017  LUTONIX CONFIDENTIAL  Page 69 of 89 unanticipated are identified in the Investigator’s Brochure, Protocol, and Informed Consent Form 
(ICF) . 
 
Unanticipated Adverse Device Effect (UADE)  
An untoward medical occurrence that happens in a subject, is related to the investigational 
device, and is  serious, and is not listed in the Investigator’s Brochure, Protocol and ICF. 
 
Adverse Event Severity Stratification  
The Investigator will use the following definitions to rate the severity of each adverse event:  
 
Mild  
 Awareness of a sign or symptom that does not interfere with the 
subject’s usual activity or is transient, resolved without treatment 
and with no sequelae.  
Moderate  
 Interferes with the subject’s usual activity and/or requires 
symptomatic treatment.  
Severe  
 Symptom(s) causing severe discomfort and significant impact of 
the subject’s usual activity and requires treatment.  
  
Relationship to study device  
The Investigator will use the following definitions to assess the relationship of the adverse event 
to the use of study device:  
 
Not Related  
 The event is definitely not associated with study device .  The 
adverse event is due to an underlying or concurrent illness or 
effect of another device or drug.  
Unlikely  
 An adverse event has little or no temporal relationship to the 
study device and/or a more likely alternative etiology exists.  
Possible  
 
 The temporal sequence between device use and the event  is 
such that the relationship is not unlikely or subject’s condition 
or concomitant therapy could have caused the AE.  
Probable  
 The temporal sequence is relevant  or the event abates upon 
device application completion/removal or the Event cannot be 
reasonably explained by the subject’s condition.  
Highly 
Probable  The temporal sequence is relevant  and the event abates upon 
device application completion/removal, or reap pearance of the 
event on repeat device application (re -challenge).   
 
 
Relationship to study procedure

7 Sept 2017  LUTONIX CONFIDENTIAL  Page 70 of 89  
Not Related  
 The event is definitely not associated with procedure .  The 
adverse event is due to an underlying or concurrent illness or 
effect of another procedure . 
Unlikely  
 An adverse event has little or no temporal relationship to the 
procedure  and/or a more likely alternative etiology exists.  
Possible  
 
 The temporal sequence between the procedure  and the event  is 
such that the relationship is not unlikely or subject’s condition 
or concomitant therapy could have caused the AE.  
Probable  
 The temporal sequence is relevant  or the event abates upon 
procedure completion  or the Event cannot be reasonably 
explained by the subject’s condition.  
Highly 
Probable  The temporal sequence is relevant  and the event abates upon 
procedure completion , or reappearance of the event on repeat 
procedure  (re-challenge).  
  
 
Abrupt or Acute Closure  
Angiographic documentation of significantly reduced flow due to mechanical dissection, 
thrombus , or severe vessel spasm in the treatment area . 
 
Acute Limb Ische mia

threat to limb viability (manifested by ischemic rest pain, ischemic ulcers, and/or gangrene) in 
patients who present within two weeks of the acute event.  
 
Acute Technical Success  
Acute technical success is defined as  the achievement of successful delivery and deployment of 
the study device(s) as intended at the intended target lesion  with < 50% residual percent stenosis  
and a successful  withdrawal of the catheter system.

Ankle systolic pressure/brachial systolic pressure, measured by constructing a ratio from the 
peak systolic pressure measured during the deflation of the ankle cuffs during Doppler detection 
to the systolic brachial pressu re. Non-compliant vessels complicate interpretation and are 
excluded from secondary endpoint analysis.  
As-Treated  
The As -Treated analysis is based only on those subjects (and target vessels) treated with either 
an investigational or control device, and th e comparison is based on the actual device used, not 
randomized assignment.     
 
Binary Restenosis  
The presence of a hemodynamically significant restenosis (>50%) as determined by the 
independent core lab analysis by angiography (if performed) or by duple x ultrasound ( based on 
study correlation of ultrasound core lab peak systolic velocity ratio s with angiographic data in 
the cohort with both).  
Clinically Driven Target Lesion Revascularization  
Revascularization at the target lesion due to worsening of Rut herford Class of the index limb, 
stagnant or worsening wound healing, or a new or recurrent wound in the index limb.  
Clinically Driven Target Vessel Revascularization  
Revascularization at the target vessel due to worsening of Rutherford Class of the index  limb, 
stagnant or worsening wound healing, or a new or recurrent wound in the index limb.  
Device Malfunction  
A malfunction is a failure of a device to meet its performance specifications or otherwise 
perform as intended. Performance specifications includ e all claims made in the labeling of the 
device. The intended performance of a device refers to the intended use for which the device is 
labeled or marketed.  
Device Success  
Acute  device success is defined as, a per device basis, the achievement of successful delivery 
and deployment of the study device(s) as intended at the intended target lesion, without balloon 
rupture or inflation/deflation abnormalities and a successful withdrawal of t he study system. If a 
device is inserted into the subject but not used due to user error (e.g. inappropriate balloon length 
or transit time too long), this device will not be included in the device success assessment.  
Discharge  
The time point at which the subject was released from the admitting hospital or transferred to 
another facility.

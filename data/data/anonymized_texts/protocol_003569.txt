This is a Phase 2, multi -center, randomized, double -blind, placebo- controlled study  to 
evalu ate the efficacy  and safet y of mapatumumab in combination with sorafenib in subjects 
with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. In addition to receiving sorafenib, subjects will be 
randomly  assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups in a 1:1 ratio to receive 30mg/kg 
mapatumumab or placebo.
Randomization will be stratified according to BCLC advanced stage C vs BCLC intermediate 
stage B and ECOG performance status (0 vs 1, 2). 
Human Genome Sciences, Inc. Confidential Page 7
Protocol HGS1012 -C1103 Amendment 0 3 Mapatumumab
Approximately  100 advanced HCC subjects will be randomized/enrolled.  
Study  Treatment:
Mapatumumab will be supplied in open label vials and third party unblinding will be 
employ ed. The study  agent will be reconstituted by  the unblinded site pharmacist or unblinded 
designee. The unblinded site pharmacist or unblinded designee will also be the person 
responsible for receiving and dispensing study agent but independent of all other study  
activities. All other study personnel, the subject, the Sponsor will remain blinded to the study  
agent received. Separate monitors will be responsible for the clinical (blinded monitor) and 
study  agent (unblinded monitor) aspects of the study .
Subjects will receive treatment every  21 day s (ie, a cy cle) as outlined below:
Arm A: Sorafenib 400 mg orally  twice daily  continuously  in each cycle + placebo 
intravenously  on Day  1 of each cy cle.
Arm B: Sorafenib 400 mg orally twice daily continuously  +
 mapatumumab (30 mg/kg) 
intravenously  on Day  1 of each cy cle.
Subjects will continue to receive study  treatment(s) until radiologic disease progression or 
unacceptable toxicit y. Subjects unable to tolerate sorafenib may continue to receive 
mapatumumab/placebo every  21 days until radiographic progression. Subjects unable to 
tolerate mapatumumab/placebo may continue to receive sorafenib until radiographic 
progression. Subjects who completed more than 24 months of study  treatment with sorafenib 
with or without mapatumumab and who in the opinion of the investigator obtain clinical 
benefit from treatment, will be allowed to continue treatment with sorafenib with or without 
unblinded mapatumumab in the clinical trial.  This extension of treatment will continue until 
the subject’s disease progresses or they withdraw from study . In addition extension of 
treatment with mapatumumab will not extend beyond the expiry  date of the drug batch 
(March 2016).
All subjects will have an end of treatment visit at least 30 days after the last dose of sorafenib 
and/or mapatumumab/placebo whichever is later, for scheduled safet y follow -up assessments . 
During the Extended Access phase, subjects will have regular visits for assessment of disease 
response at least every  3 m onths or as per standard of care, whichever is sooner. In addition ,
BP will be monitored every  6weeks and recorded in the eCRF. Serious AEs will continue to 
be collected during this Extended Access phase according to Section 8. Study  drug 
administration and inventory /accountability  will continue to be recorded during this period 
according to Section 5.
Disease Assessments:
Radiol ogic disease assessments along with assessment of alpha fetoprotein will be performed 
at the end of every  two 21-day cycles (ie, Cycles 2, 4, 6 and every  2 cycles thereafter). The AM03
15Jul15AM03
15Jul15
Human Genome Sciences, Inc. Confidential Page 8
Protocol HGS1012 -C1103 Amendment 0 3 Mapatumumab
disease assessment will be performed and documented no earlier than 5 days before the start 
of the next cycle. Clinical responses will be evaluated according to mRECI ST for HCC (see 
Section 6.8andAppendix 5). The same assessment method will be used through out the study  
for each subject. If disease progression is based only on new lesions or is equivocal, images 
will be provided to the blinded, independent, central reader (BICR) for confirmation of 
disease progression. Partial response (PR) and complete response (CR) will be confirmed at 
the next scheduled disease assessment (no fewer than 4 weeks after the initial documentation 
of PR or CR). All imaging scans used for disease assessments will be made available for 
independent radiology  review by  the Sponsor or designee.
During the Extended Access phase, subjects will have regular visits for assessment of disease 
response at least every  3 months or as per standard of care, whichever is sooner, until disease 
progression is documented. Independent radiological review for confirmation of disease 
progression is not required.
Safety  Assessments:
The safety  of sorafenib and mapatumumab will be assessed by evaluation of the type, 
frequency , and severity of adverse events (ie, according to the NCI-CTCAE Version 4.0
grading) and changes in clinical laboratory  tests (hematology  and clinical chemistry )and 
immunogenicit y over time. In the event that an adverse event does not have an NCI-CTCAE 
Version 4.0 grading, the severit y grades in Section 8.6 will be used. Adverse events (including 
serious adverse events) will be captured from the start of study  agent administration (sorafenib 
and/or mapatumumab/placebo) through at least 30 days following the last dose of sorafenib 
and/or mapatumumab/plac ebo, whichever is later. Laboratory  assessments will be performed 
at screening, and during each study  visit outlined in the study  calendar found in Section 6.3.
During the Extended Access phase, laboratory  assessments 
will be performed as per standard 
of care; 
SAEs will continue to be collected according to Section 8.
The Human Genome Sciences Review Committeee (HGSRC) is comprised of the Department 
Heads of Biostatistics, Regulatory  Affairs and Drug Development. The HGSRC will review 
safet y data after: (1) 10 subjects have completed 1 cycle;and (2) 30 subjects have completed 
1cycle. 
HGSRC reviews of safet y data will be conducted approximately  every 4  m onths 
thereafter, until 90% of subjects have reached radiologic progression. The HGSRC may 
conduct additional reviews at their own request and/or at the request of the Medical Monitor. 
The HGSRC may request the unblinding of treatment assignment for a subject and/or 
treatment groups. If treatment assig nments are unblinded, the rationale for the unblinding will 
be documented.
Immunogenicit y:
Blood samples for serum antibodies to mapatumumab will be obtained as outlined in Table 6-
1.

Dose modifications will not be allowed for mapatumumab/placebo. Dose modifications of 
sorafenib for toxicity  will be made according to the guidelines provided in the treatment 
section (Section 5.2.3) of the protocol.
Details regarding pre-treatment and management of hypersensitivity  reactions related to 
mapatumumab are provided in Section 5.1.5 andAppendix 8 .
Pharmacokinetics:
Multiple blood specimens will be obtained from subjects for serum mapatumumab 
concentration determinations as outlined in 
Table 6-1.
Pharmacod ynamics:
Subjects will be given the option to participate in a biomarker research sub-study . Consenting 
subjects will be asked to provide a historicall y obtained biopsy  sample, if available, and 
several blood samples. In addition, samples will be requested from subjects who undergo a 
biopsy  during the treatment period.
To examine biomarkers present peripherall y, blood will b e drawn during Cy cles 1 and 2, from 
which DNA and serum proteins will be isolated. The biomarker sub
-study  is detailed in 
Appendix 6 .
Exploratory  Assessments:
Blood samples will be collected for quantification of B and T lymphocy te subsets on Day 1 
(prior to dosing) and Day 15 of Cy cles 1 and 2.
Study  Endpoints:
The following will be evaluated (these endpoints and the respective analy ses are defined in 
Section 9):
Primary :
•Time to pro gression (TTP) .
Secondary :
•Overall survival.
•Progression
-free survival.
•Objective response (complete response [CR] + partial response [PR]).
•Disease control (CR + PR + stable disease [SD]).
•Response duration and time to response in responders.
•Frequency  and severity  of treatment -emergent adverse events.
•Laboratory  parameters.
Human Genome Sciences, Inc. Confidential Page 10
Protocol HGS1012 -C1103 Amendment 0 3 Mapatumumab
•Serum mapatumumab concentrations for use in a population pharmacokinetic anal ysis.
Statistical Methods:
Sample Size:
A total of approximately 100 subjects will be randomly  assigned to 1 of 2 arms and treated 
with either sorafenib + placebo or the 2-agent combination of sorafenib and mapatumumab at 
30mg/kg in a 1:1ratio. A sample size of 50 subjects randomized and treated in each group is 
sufficient to estimate the median time to pro gression with a precision of approximately  
-1.9M 
to +2.6 M relative to the observed median. In addition, a sample size of 50 patients per arm 
will provide 80% power to detect an improvement in TTP from 5.5 to 8.9M with at a 
one-sided significance level o f 0.10.
Statistical Analy sis:
The primary  analysis will be an estimate of median time to progression in each arm using 
Kaplan Meier methods, reported with 95% confidence intervals, along with testing the 
hazard ratio for time to progression at a 1-sided significance level of 0.10 with a Cox 
proportional hazards model controlling for the factors stratify ing the randomization as 
covariates. Secondary  analyses include estimates, using Kaplan Meier methods, of median 
progression
-free survival (PFS) and median overall survival (OS) along with associated 
logrank testing. In addition, estimates of overall response rate (CR+PR) and disease control 
rate (CR+PR+SD) will be reported with 95% confidence intervals and an estimate of the 
difference in response rates and disease control rates between groups will be reported and 
tested for significance with a Pearson chi-square test (or Fisher’s exact test). For frequency  
and severit y of adverse events and laboratory  toxicity  grading, counts and rates will be 
presented.
Study Calendar:
The study  calendar is located in Section 6.3of the protocol.AM01

1Background
1.1 Hepatocellular Carcinoma
Hepatocellular carcinoma is the 5thmost common cancer worldwide accounting for 2% of all 
malignancies. It is the 3rdleading cause of cancer -related death globall y with 1million new 
cases a year (WHO , 2002 ; IACR , 2002; Ferlay etal, 2004; Lopezet al, 2006).
Hepatocellular carcinoma is more prevalent in males with a male:female ratio as high as 8:1. 
Depending on the endemic risk factors, hepatocellular carcinoma is diagnosed during the 
4ththrough 6thdecade s of life. The reported incidence of  hepatocellular carcinoma is 
increasing because of a better ability  to diagnose the disease and because of the long-term 
consequences of hepatitis C virus (HCV) and hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection (Ries et al, 
2006). Worldwide the most common cause of hepatocellular carcinoma is chronic HBV 
infection (El-Serag et al, 2003). Endemic areas thus include China, South Asia and 
South Africa where the incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma can be as high as 120 cases 
per100,000. In the United States, where HCV and alcohol are the main risk factors, 
theage-adjusted incidence rates have increased from 1.4 cases per 100,000 in 1980 to a 
current incidence of 4 cases per 100,000. This equates to about 8500-11,000 new cases 
diagnosed each year (IACR
, 2002; Ferlay et al, 2004; Pawlik et al, 2004; Edwards , et al, 2005; 
Jemal etal, 2007; Bosch et al, 2004).
1.2 Treatment Options for Patients with Hepatocellular Carcinoma
Surgery , including transplantation, is the only curative modalit y for hepatocellular carcinoma 
(Venook , 1994; Cha et al, 2003). The 5-year survival rate for patients with unresectable 
hepatocellular carcinoma is 11% in the US (ACS , 2007), < 8% in Europe (Capocaccia et al, 
2007), and < 10% in Asia ( Teoand Fock, 2001). Symptomatic hepatocellular carcinoma has a 
very poor prognosi s with a median survival of 1
–8 months (Forner et al, 2006; Llovet et al, 
1999a, Llovet et al, 1999 b).
Sorafenib, a multikinase inhibitor, is the 1stsystemic therap y to significantly  impact survival 
in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma, as demonstrated in an international, 
multicenter Phase 3, placebo -controlled trial (Llovet et al, 2008). Sorafenib was approved in 
the United States and European Union for the 1st-line treatment of advanced hepatocellular 
carcinoma in late 2007 and the 2008 National 
Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines 
have been updated with the addition of sorafenib as a treatment option for hepatocellular 
carcinoma patients. The updated Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCL C) guidelines 
recommend sorafenib for hepatocellular carcinoma patients with BCLC Advanced Stage (C) 
(Forner et al, 2010).
1.3 The Role of the TRA IL Pathway  in HCC
1.3.1 TRAIL and TRA IL Receptors
TRAIL is a member of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) ligand superfamily , with homology  
toFas/Apo1 ligand ( Pitti et al, 1996; Wiley et al, 1995). TRAIL induces programmed 
celldeath primaril y in tumor cells through activation of TRAIL  death receptors, TRAIL -R1 
Human Genome Sciences, Inc. Confidential Page 18
Protocol HGS1012 -C1103 Amendment 0 3 Mapatumumab
(death receptor 4) or TRAIL -R2 (death receptor 5) (Ashkenazi etal, 1999; Evdokiou et al, 
2002; Kothny -Wilkes et al, 1998; Lawrence et al, 2001; Pitti et al, 1996; Walczak et al, 1999; 
Wiley et al, 1995).
TRAIL -R1, the target of mapatumumab, is detectable on tumor cells derived from colon, lung, 
liver, gastric, pancreas, uterus and esophagus and in tissue sections from various tumors of the 
colon, lung, pancreas, liver and stomach without significant expression in parallel normal 
tissues ( Halpern et al, 2004; Roach et al, 2004).
1.3.2 TRAIL and HBV/HCV Infection
Acutel y infected tissues, including the liver, utilize the TRAIL pathway  to eliminate virally 
and bacteriall y infected cells (Herr et al, 2007). In viral hepatitis, TRAIL and 1of its 
receptors, TRAIL -R2, are upregulated and contribute to the elimination of infected 
hepatocy tes associated with viral hepatitis ( Bantel and Schulze -Osthoff, 2003; Linet al, 2002; 
Matsuda et al, 2005). In addition to HBV and HCV infection, steatosis, exposure to bile acids 
and chronic alcohol exposure induce increased expression of TRAIL and TRAIL -R2, but not 
TRAIL -R1, in human hepatocy tes (Dunn et al, 2007; Mundt et al, 2005). Cell surface 
expression of TRAIL -R2, but not TRAIL -R1, was altered and responsible for sensitization to 
TRAIL in hepatocy tes expos ed to bile acids (Higuchi et al, 2001; Malhi et al, 2007). These 
findings have been reproduced in preclinical models. Non-virally  infected hepatocy tes are 
refractory  to TRAIL and TRAIL -R agonists but exposure of HCV -infected hepatocy tes to 
TRAIL leads 
to a significant level of apoptosis (Volkmann et al, 2007). Inhibition of the 
TRAIL pathway  may protect infected cells from apoptosis and allow for chronic infection 
(Mundt et al, 2003). Recent non-clinical observations demonstrated that natural killer cells 
expressing the ligand TRAIL, are enriched in the livers of patients with chronic HBV 
infection, and TRAIL is overexpressed in the livers of patients with HCV -associ ated steatosis 
(Mundt et al, 2005). 
In summary , preclinical data suggest that mapatumumab may promote apoptosis of cancer 
cells, including hepatocellular carcinoma 
cells. Whether viral infection, including HBV or 
HCV infection, will attenuate or modulate the effects of mapatumumab on hepatocy tes is not 
yet known, but experience to date in a Phase 1b trial of mapatumumab in combination with 
sorafenib in subjects with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma who are positive for hepatitis B 
surface antigen or hepatitis C antibody  indicates that the safet y experience is consistent with 
underly ing disease and known sorafenib toxicities (see Section 1.2).
1.4 Mapatumumab
1.4.1 Mapatumumab Pharmacology
Mapatumumab is a fully human, agonist monoclonal antibody  that activates the cell death 
pathway  in tumor cells by specifically  binding to TRAIL -R1 with high affinity . 
Mapatumumab efficiently  induces apoptosis in human cancer cell lines 
expressing the 
TRAIL -R1 protein on the cell surface. Nonclinical studies have demonstrated that 
mapatumumab can induce cy totoxicity  in multiple tumor cell lines representing both solid and 
hematological malignancies, including cancers of the biliary  tract, colon, lung, breast, 
Human Genome Sciences, Inc. Confidential Page 19
Protocol HGS1012 -C1103 Amendment 0 3 Mapatumumab
pancreas, esophagus, ovary , kidney , uterus, as well as lymphoma and various leukemias. 
Mapatumumab has also demonstrated anti-tumor activity  as a single agent, preventing 
tumor growth and in some cases causing regression of tumors in xenograft tumor models of 
multiple human malignancies, including lung, colon, kidney , and uterus (Camidge , 2007; 
Georgakis etal, 2005; Jinet al, 2007; Humphrey s, 2004; Marini et al, 2006; Menoret etal, 
2006; Pukac et al, 2005).
The relationship between receptor expression and response to therap y with mapatumumab 
remains unclear. In vitro studies of cell lines have shown that TRAIL -R1 expression level is 
not a consistent predictor of response to mapatumumab. Although both TRAIL -R1 expression 
and apoptosis in response to mapatumumab are increased in many  tumor cell lines as 
compared with normal diploid cells, there are exampl es of mapatumumab cytotoxicity  on cell 
lines with very low levels of detectable receptor, and conversel y, mapatumumab resistant cell 
lines that have relatively  high levels of TRAIL -R1 cell surface expression.
Tumor cell cytotoxic activity  can be enhanced when mapatumumab is administered in 
combination with chemotherapeutics or other anti-neoplastic agents. Enhanced apoptotic 
signaling, in vitro cell killing and in vivo anti-tumor activity  have been observed when 
mapatumumab has been combined with various types of therapeutic agents and treatments 
including microtubule poisons, antimetabolites, topoisomerase inhibitors, proteosome 
inhibitors, platinum agents and radiation. Both the level and spectrum of activity  of 
mapatumumab is enhanced in invitro cytotox icity and invivo xenograft studies in 
combination with various chemotherapeutic and anti-neoplastic agents, including a xenograft 
model of hepatocellular carcinoma in combination with cisplatin and gemcitabine 
(Camidge ,2007; Pukac et al, 2005; Georgakis et al, 2005; Humphrey s, 2004; Jinet al, 2007; 
Human Genome Sciences data on file).
Please refer to the mapatumumab Investigator’s Brochur e for detailed information regarding 
the nonclinical pharmacology , toxicology , and PK of mapatumumab.
1.4.2 Non- Clinical Mapatumumab Safety  Studies
To assess the nonclinical safet y of mapatumumab, a 6-month toxicity  study, with a 4-month 
recovery  period, was conducted in chimpanzees. Mapatumumab was administered 
intravenously  at up to 40 mg/kg every  10 days. No mapatumumab -specific toxicity  was 
identified and no anti
-mapatumumab antibodies were detected.
To assess its off-target effects, mapatumumab was administe red intravenously  weekly to 
cynomolgus monkey s, whose TRAIL  R1 homolog does not bind mapatumumab. 
Mapatumumab was well tolerated at doses of up to 50 mg/kg and was not highl y 
immunogenic: of the 40 monkey s treated, 1 developed anti-mapatumumab antibodies. The 
positive response was observed in an animal in the high dose (50 mg/kg) group.
In vitro, mapatumumab was found to decrease viability  of normal human hepatocy tes, 
although the observed effect was less than that observed with TRAIL. This effect was varia ble 
across donors and did not amplify  with increasing concentrations of mapatumumab. It should 
Human Genome Sciences, Inc. Confidential Page 20
Protocol HGS1012 -C1103 Amendment 0 3 Mapatumumab
be noted that in clinical studies, plasma mapatumumab concentrations have been achieved that 
are > 1100–fold greater than the minimum exposure resulting in reduc ed in vitro hepatocy te 
viability . Despite this, the clinical results do not reveal evidence of hepatotoxicity  in those 
studies. Hence it appears that the in vitro hepatocy te viability  assay is not predictive of 
mapatumumab effects in vivo.
1.4.3 Clinical Experie nce with Mapatumumab
Over 400 subjects have received mapatumumab in clinical trials to date. Preliminary  clinical 
data are available from 218 subjects who received mapatumumab as a single agent at doses 
ranging from 0.01 to20
mg/kg across 6 clinical trials.
Based on available data, mapatumumab appears to be well tolerated and no significant safet y 
issues have been observed. Adverse events have generall y been mild to moderate in severity , 
manageable, and do not appear related to dose. The most frequentl y reported treatment -
related 
adverse events occurring in > 10% of subjects were fatigue, hypotension, nausea and pyrexia. 
Severe events have been uncommon and generally judged not related to mapatumumab. 
Severe events judged at least possibl y related to mapatumumab have been observed and a 
complete list can be found in the mapatumumab Investigator’s Brochure. Grade 3 or Grade 4 
hematologic, renal, or hepatic laboratory  abnormalities also have been relativel y uncommon 
with no significant trend or dose-response evident. Lym phopenia was the most commonl y 
observed laboratory  abnormality , but tended to be intermittent and reversible and was not 
associated with infectious events.
In subjects with solid tumors, stable disease has been the best response observed with 
mapatumumab as a single -agent. However, 2 complete responses (CRs ) and 1 partial response 
(PR) were observed in subjects with follicular ly mphoma.
In addition, preliminary  clinical data are available from 234 subjects who received 
mapatumumab at doses rangin g from 1 to 30 mg/kg every  21 days in combination with 
chemotherap y in 5 clinical trials (carboplatin/paclitaxel [N=100], gemcitabine/cisplatin 
[N=49], bortezomib [n=69], or sorafenib [n=16]. Mapatumumab has been generall y well 
tolerated; adverse events and laboratory  abnormalities have been consistent with those 
expected with underl ying disease or chemotherapy . A listing of severe events considered at 
least possibly  related to mapatumumab can be found in the mapatumumab Investigator’s 
Brochure. The most commonly  occurring laboratory  abnormalities have been hematologic 
(ie,anemia, neutropenia, thrombocy topenia, and leukopenia), as expected with chemotherapy . 
Grade 3/4 laboratory  abnormalities have been relatively  uncommon. Higher frequencies of 
Grad e 3/4 neutropenia, leukopenia, lymphopenia, and thrombocy topenia have been observed. 
Data from randomized Phase 2 studies in combination with chemotherap y suggest that 
mapatumumab may  increase rates of l ymphopenia.
One subject receiving mapatumumab in combination with carboplatin/paclitaxel has 
achieved a CR. Twenty -two subjects receiving mapatumumab in combination with 
paclitaxel/carboplatin and 12 subjects receiving mapatumumab in combination with 
gemcitabine/cisplatin have achieved PRs. Three subjects receiving mapatumumab in 
Human Genome Sciences, Inc. Confidential Page 21
Protocol HGS1012 -C1103 Amendment 0 3 Mapatumumab
combination with bortezomib achieved CRs; 25 subjects receiving mapatumumab in 
combination with bortezomib achieved a PR.  
1.5 Rationale for the Evaluation of Mapatumumab in Combination with 
Sorafenib in Hepatocellular Carcinoma
Sorafen ib is the standard of care for treatment of patients with advanced hepatocellular 
carcinoma. Sorafenib is a multikinase inhibitor that targets the Raf/mitogen -activated protein 
kinase/extracellular signal- regulated kinase signaling pathway , blocks tumor an giogenesis and 
induces apoptosis (Panka et al, 2006; Rahmani et al, 2005; Yuet al, 2005; Wilhelm et al, 
2004). Sorafenib was approved by the European Medicines Agency and the Food and Drug 
Administration in 2007 for treatment of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma based on the 
demonstration of improved overall survival in the 602 patient randomized, placebo
-controlled, 
Phase 3 “Sorafenib Hepatocellular Carcinoma Assessment Randomized Protocol” (SHARP)
trial. Approximately  half the 602 patients had either hepatitis C virus or hepatitis B virus as 
underly ing etiology  and 26% had alcohol -related cirrhosis. The median overall survival was 
10.7 months for patients in the sorafenib arm compared with 7.0 months for patients in the 
placebo arm (hazard ratio in the sorafenib group, 0.69 95% confidence interval, 0.55 to 0.87; 
p <0.001). The median time to radiologic progression was 5.5 months in the sorafenib arm, 
compared wit h 2.8 months in the placebo arm (p < 0.0001) ( Llovet et al, 2008). Seven patients 
in the sorafenib group (2%) and 2 patients in the placebo group (1%) had a PR; no patients 
had a CR.
A 2ndrandomized, placebo -controlled Phase 3 trial was conducted in the Asia-Pacific region 
(Cheng et al, 2009). The 226 patients randomly  assigned to sorafenib or placebo in this trial 
appeared to have more advanced disease than those in the SHARP trial, with a higher 
frequency  of extrahepatic spread, poorer ECOG PS, and higher levels of AFP, but still showed 
a benefit from treatment with sorafenib. The majority  (73%) had hepatitis B virus as an 
underly ing etiology . The median overall survival was 6.5 months for patients in the soraf enib 
arm, compared with 4.2 months in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.68, 95% confidence 
interval, 0.50- 0.93; p = 0.014). The median time to progression was 2.8 months in the 
sorafenib group, compared with 1.4 months in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.57, 95% 
confidence interval 0.42 -0.79; p =0.0005).
The mechanisms of sorafenib and mapatumumab action suggest that these agents could 
interact synergistically . Sorafenib sensitizes human cancer cell lines, including cell lines 
derived from hepatocellula r carcinoma, to apoptotic stimuli by reducing expression of 
apoptotic regulatory  proteins; Mcl-1, Bcl-xL, a nd FLIP (Kim et al,2008; Koehler et al, 2009; 
Rosato etal, 2007; Liuet al, 2006; Rahmani et al, 2005; Yuet al, 2005). Mcl-1, Bcl-xL 
andFLIP have also been shown to mediate sensitivity  of a wide range of tumor cell lines 
toTRAIL receptor agonists (Meng et al, 2007; Rosato et al, 2007; Llobet et al 2010;
Blechacz etal, 2009; Katzet al, 2009; Huang and Sincrope, 2010; and Menoret et al, 2006). 
Recent studies demonstrated the combination of sorafenib with TRAIL  or TRAIL receptor 
antibodies has significant activity  in hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines (Koehler et al, 2009) 
and colon tumor xenografts (Ricci et al, 2007) that were resistant to TRAIL and an antibody  
against TRAIL -R2.
Human Genome Sciences, Inc. Confidential Page 22
Protocol HGS1012 -C1103 Amendment 0 3 Mapatumumab
Mapatumumab activit y has been evaluated preclinically  in hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines 
by in vitro cytotoxicity  assays both as a single agent and in combination with doxorubicin, 
cisplatin, gemcitabine or sorafenib. Single agent mapatumumab activity  was observed in 4 of 
10 hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines. Increased in vitro cytotoxicity , including examples of 
synergy , were observed in 8of 10 cell lines when mapatumumab was combined with 
doxorubicin or cisplatin or the combination of cisplatin and gemcitabine (Humphrey set al, 
2008). Two of these hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines were evaluated for invitro 
cytotoxicity  of mapatumumab in combination with sorafenib. One display ed an increase in 
cytotoxicity  from 30% to 60% when treated with a combination of sorafenib and 
mapatumumab. Importantly , treatment of a primary  human hepatocy te cell line did not induce 
any apoptosis at doses of mapatumumab that were cytotoxic to hepatocellular carcinoma cell 
lines (Abdulghani et al, 2008). Therefore, collectivel y, the expression of TRAIL -R1 in 
hepatocellular carcinoma and preclinical activity  observed with combinations of 
mapatumumab with chemotherap y or sorafenib supports the rationale that this combination 
may be able to effectively  target hepatocellular carcinoma.
1.6 Rationale for Dose Selection
As of June 2010, mapatumumab has been administered with chemotherap y 
(ie,carboplatin/paclitaxel, gemcitabine/cisplatin, bortezomib, or sorafenib) to 234 subjects, 
including 61 subjects who received 20 mg/kg and 50 subjects who received 30mg/kg 
mapatumumab. Based on available data, mapatumumab in combinat ion with chemotherap y is 
generall y well tolerated at dose levels up to and including 30 mg/kg, and no significant safet y 
issues have been observed in the course of the clinical trials even at the higher doses.  
Preliminary  PK data are available for subjec ts who received 1, 10, 20 or 30mg/kg 
mapatumumab in combination with gemcitabine and cisplatin (n = 49), 10 or 30mg/kg 
mapatumumab in combination with paclitaxel and carboplatin (n = 73),and 3, 
10, or 
30mg/kg mapatumumab in combination with sorafenib (n = 17). Serum or plasma 
mapatumumab concentrations are consistentl y within the range of expected concentrations 
predicted from Phase 1 study  results in solid tumor patients administered mapatumumab as 
monotherap y. Mapatumumab PK islinear and not affected by the addition of therapeutic 
agents. As expected, the observed peak and trough levels of mapatumumab at 30mg/kg are 
2to 3 times higher than those observed at 10mg/kg. Exposure appears to increase in 
proportion to dose and exposures for a given dose a re similar across studies. 
A Phase 1b dose escalation study  of mapatumumab in combination with sorafenib in subjects 
with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma who are positive for hepatitis B surface antigen or 
hepatitis C antibody  is being conducted. Safet yobservations have been consistent with the 
underly ing disease and known sorafenib toxicities. As of June 2010, 6 subjects have received 
3mg/kg, 9 subjects have received 10 mg/kg, and 1 subject has received 30mg/kg 
mapatumumab. The number of cycles compl eted ranges from 1 to 20; 4/16 (25.0%) of 
subjects have completed 11 or more cycles. Adverse events have generally  been consistent 
with published reports of the toxicities associated with sorafenib and previous experience 
with mapatumumab, as well as under lying disease. The most frequently  occurring 
treatment -emergent adverse events, regardless of severit y or attribution of causality , 
Human Genome Sciences, Inc. Confidential Page 23
Protocol HGS1012 -C1103 Amendment 0 3 Mapatumumab
include diarrhea (10/16, 62.5%), fatigue (9/16, 56.3%), nausea (9/16, 56.3%), and vomiting 
(7/16, 43.8%). Serious adverse events, regardless of attribution of causalit y, include 
hypertension, upper respiratory  tract infection, atrial fibrillation, hyperbilirubinemia, 
hypoglycemia, and hepatic pain. Severe adverse events considered at least possibly  related to 
mapatumumab or itsinteraction with sorafenib include elevated lipase (3/16, 18.8%), hepatic 
pain (1/16, 6.3%), and thrombocytopenia (1/16, 6.3%). Laboratory  abnormalities have 
generall y been mild or moderate in severit y, manageable, and/or consistent with those 
expected with chemotherapy  or the underly ing disease. The most frequent Grade 3 or Grade 4 
laboratory  abnormalities include elevated total bilirubin (Grade 3, 4/16, 25.0%; Grade 4, 
1/16, 6.3%) and lymphopenia (Grade 3, 3/16, 18.8%; Grade 4, 2/16, 12.5%). Additional 
information on the safety  experience can be found in the mapatumumab Investigators’ 
Brochure.
Based on the information currentl y available, the safet y profile continues to be favorable, 
supporting continued evaluation of mapatumumab in combination with chem otherap y, 
including sorafenib. The maximum tolerated dose has not been reached in any of the Phase 1 
or Phase 2 trials conducted to date. Thus, further evaluation of the 30 mg/kg dose is 
warranted.
The dose of sorafenib for this study , 400 mg twice daily, is the approved dose for the 
treatment of unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma.

intravenously  on Day  1 of each cy cle
Arm B: Sorafenib 400 mg orally twice daily continuously  in each cycle + mapatumumab 
(30 mg/kg) intravenousl y on Day  1 of each cy cle
Randomization
Randomization will be stratified according to BCLC advanced stage C vs BCLC intermediate 
stage B and ECOG performance status (0 vs 1, 2).
Estimated St udy Duration:
The study  is estimated to occur over approximately  24 months. Subjects will continue to 
receive sorafenib with or without mapatumumab/placebo until radiologic disease progression 
or unacceptable toxicity . Estimated median length of subject t reatment is 6 -8 months. Subjects 
who completed more than 24 months of study  treatment with mapatumumab and/or sorafenib 
and who in the opinion of the investigator obtain clinical benefit from treatment, will be 
allowed to continue treatment with unblinded mapatumumab and/or sorafenib in the clinical 
trial.  This extension of treatment will continue until the subject’s disease progresses or they 
withdraw from study . In addition extension of treatment with mapatumumab will not extend 
beyond the expiry  date of the drug batch (March 2016).
All subjects will have an End of Treatment visit at least 30 days after the last dose of 
sorafenib and/or mapatumumab/placebo, whichever is later, for scheduled safet y follow -up 
assessments.
During the Extended Access phase, subjects will have regular visits for disease assessments 
according to local standard of care. The response assessment will be performed and 
documented at 12 week intervals (± 6 days). In addition BP will be monitored every  6weeks 
and recorded in the eCRF . Serious AEs will continue to be collected during this Extended AM03

Human Genome Sciences, Inc. Confidential Page 28
Protocol HGS1012 -C1103 Amendment 0 3 Mapatumumab
•Lot number
•Storage instructions
•Investigational drug statement
•Manufacturer’s name and address
Study  agent inventory /accountability  forms will be examined and reconciled by the unblinded 
study  monitor or designee. At the end of the study , all used and unused investigational study  
agent will be accounted for on a study  agent accountability  form provided to the investigator 
by the Sponsor or designee. Please refer to the HGS1012 -C1103 Pharmacy  Manual for more 
details regarding storage, handling and drug accountability .
5.1.3 Mapatumumab/Placebo Dose, Route of Administration and Schedule
The dose of mapatumumab is 30 mg/kg. Mapatumumab dose calculations will be based upon 
the subject’s weight measured on Day 1 or within 3 days before Day 1 of each cycle. The 
planned duration of each treatment cycle will be 21 da ys. Mapatumumab/placebo will be 
administered on Day  1 of each cy cle.
After reconstitution with sterile water for injection, the calculated mapatumumab dose to be 
administered to the subject will be further diluted in normal saline to a total volume of 
250mL for intravenous infusion. After adding the reconstituted product, the bag will be 
gentl y inverted to mix the solution. Following reconstitution and/or dilution in normal saline, 
mapatumumab will be stored at 2-8ºC. Theproduct will be administered to the subject within 
8 hours of reconstitution. Refer to the HGS1012 -C1103 Pharmacy  Manual for instructions on 
admixing and administering stud y agent. 
Two hundred -fifty mLnormal saline solution for intravenous infusion will be administered as 
placebo for map atumumab.
Mapatumumab/placebo will be infused at a constant rate over 1 hour.
Infusion and hypersensitivity  reactions may occur. A suggested pre-medication regimen for 
mapatumumab/placebo consists of diphenhy dramine and acetaminophen administered within 
1 hour 
prior to the start of the mapatumumab/placebo dose. Use of a pre-medication regimen 
and alternatives to this regimen are at the investigator’s discretion.
Subjects will be monitored closel y during and after infusion for any sign of acute adverse 
react ion. If an allergic reaction occurs, see Section 5.1.5 and Appendix 8for suggested 
medical management.
5.1.4 Mapatumumab/Placebo Dose Toxicity /Delay
Mapatumumab/placebo will be discontinued for Grade 4 transaminase elevations of any 
duration if they  are considered related to mapatumumab.AM01
21Dec10
Human Genome Sciences, Inc. Confidential Page 29
Protocol HGS1012 -C1103 Amendment 0 3 Mapatumumab
Mapatumumab/placebo may be delay ed up to 2 weeks for toxicities considered related to 
mapatumumab as described below or if the investigat or believes that a delay  in dosing is 
warranted in the interest of subject safety .
The National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events 
(NCI -CTCAE, Version 4.0) will be used to grade AEs.
•Grade 4 neutropenia for > 7 consecutive daysor febrile neutropenia.
•Grade 4 thrombocy topenia.
•Grade 3 or greater non -hematologic AEs except transient transaminase, amylaseand 
lipase abnormalities for which the following criteria will apply :
-Grade 3 or Grade 4 elevations in transaminases that do no t resolve to baseline or 
Grade 1 before the next cy cle.
-Grade 3 elevations in lipase or am ylase associated with clinical/imaging findings of 
pancreatitis, or resulting in chronic damage to the pancreas. 
-Any Grade 4 elevations in lipase or am ylase for > 4 consecutive day s.
If mapatumumab/placebo is delay ed for toxicity  and the toxicity  does not resol ve (≤Grade 1) 
or return to baseline within 2 weeks after the delay ed dose was originally  scheduled (based on 
a 21-day treatment cycle), the subject will be withdrawn from further treatment with 
mapatumumab/placebo. If mapatumumab/placebo is delay ed because the investigator believes 
a delay  is warranted in the interest of subject safety  and dosing of mapatumumab/placebo is 
not resumed within 2 weeks after the delay ed dose was originall y scheduled (based on a 
21-day treatment cycle), the subject will be withdrawn from future treatment with 
mapatumumab/placebo. Sorafenib dosing will continue while mapatumumab/placebo dosing 
is held. The subject will continue receiving sorafenib until radiologic progressive disease or 
an unacceptable toxicity  occurs, at the dis cretion of the Investigator. 
Doses of mapatumumab may  not be altered.
5.1.5 Management of A llergic/Hy persensitivity Reactions to 
Mapatumumab/Placebo
The administration of any recombinant protein has the potential to induce local or system 
immunologic reactions; subjects could experience, for example , acute allergic reactions. To 
date, 2 such SAEs have been reported which were considered related to mapatumumab 
(hypersensitivity  and 
angioedema/facial edema). In the event of allergic/hy persensitivity  
reactions, investigators will institute treatment measures according to best medical and 
nursing practice. Guidelines for treatment are provided in Appendix 8 .
For a NCI-CTCAE Version 4.0Grade 3 or Grade 4 hypersensitivity  reaction, treatment with 
mapatumumab/placebo will be discontinued.
If mapatumumab/placebo is discontinued for Grade 3 or Grade 4 hypersensitivity  reactions, 
the subject will continue to receive sorafenib, until radiologic progression or unacceptable 
toxicit y.

5Pharmacokinetics: Blood specimens will be collected for determination of serum mapatumumab concentrations from subjects as fo llows:  Cycle 1 (on Day 1 prior to th e administration 
mapatumumab/placebo and at the completion of the mapatumumab/placebo infusion, and on Day 8), Cycles 2, 4 and 6 and thereafte r on each even cycle (prior to dosing on Day 1), on 
the day of each disease assessment, and at the end of treatmen t visit (at least 30 days after the last dose). On days when immunogenicity and pharmacokinetic samples are collected 
they will be collected together.  
6Biomarkers: For subjects participating in the optional biomarker sub -study, historical biopsy samples w ill be collected, if available, and samples will be collected if obtained during the 
treatment period in Cycle 1 Days 1 (pre -dose mapatumumab), 2, 3, 8 and 15 and Cycle 2 Days 1 (pre -dose mapatumumab), 3, 8 and 15. In addition, blood samples will be obtain ed as 
follows: blood for isolation of DNA will be collected once, preferably in Cycle 1. Blood for isolation of serum will be colle cted in Cycles 1 and 2 (pre -dose on the day of 
mapatumumab/placebo dosing). Further details on the biomarker sub -study are ou tlined in Appendix 6 .
7Study Agent Administration:   Sorafenib will be administered at a dose of 400 mg twice daily without food (at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after a meal). On days when both sorafenib and 
mapatumumab/placeb o are administered together, sorafenib should be taken at the same time as any other calendar day.
8Vital Signs: Blood pressure will be monitored weekly for the first 6 weeks. Vital signs will be obtained within 30 minutes prior to administration of mapatum umab/placebo and at the end of 
infusion on Day 1 of each cycle. For subjects in the Extended Access Phase, only BP is required to be monitored and this shou ld be performed every 6 weeks (± 3 days).
9Body W eight: To be obtained on the day of or within 3 days before dosing on Day 1 of each cycle.
10Performance Status: Obtained prior to dosing on Day 1 of each cycle.AM03

11Adverse Events: (S)AE collection begins with the start of 1ststudy agent administration. Concurrent medications will be recorded within 28 days pr ior to Cycle 1 Day 1. For subjects in 
the Extended Access Phase, only SAEs will be recorded.
12Disease and α –Fetoprotein (AFP) Assessments: Radiologic and AFP assessments will be performed at the end of every 2 cycles (ie, Cycles 2, 4 , 6, etc). For subjects discontinuing 
treatment prior to documentation of radiologic disease progression, disease a ssessments will be performed every 6 weeks (± 3 days), starting 6 weeks after the previous disease 
assessment while on study, until radiologic disease progression is documented. If disease progression is based only on new le sions or is equivocal, images wi ll be provided to the 
blinded, independent reader for confirmation of disease progression. All imaging scans used for disease assessments will be made available for independent radiology review by the 
Sponsor or designee. F or subjects in the Extended Acces s Phase, disease assessments will be performed as at least every 3 months or as per standard of care, whichever is sooner, 
until disease progression is documented. Independent radiological review of response or for confirmation of disease progressi on is no t required.
13Subjects who discontinue mapatumumab/placebo will complete the current cycle assessments per the study calendar. Subsequently, for subjects in the Extended Access Phase, 
subjects receiving sorafenib alone will be assessed as per local standard of care and will return at least every 6 weeks for BP monitoring. Serious adverse events will be recorded 
throughout the study

6.4 Extended A ccess to Study  Drug
Subjects who completed more than 24 months of study  treatment sorafenib with or without 
mapatumumab and who in the opinion of the investigator obtain clinical benefit from 
treatment, will be allowed to continue treatment with sorafenib with or without unblinded 
mapatumumab in the clinical trial.  Prior to continuing into the Extended Access phase, 
subjects will be re-consented to agree to the study  assessments and a local re-review of their 
pathology /cytology . This extension of treatment will continue until the subject’s disease 
progresses (Section 6.8) or they withdraw from study  (Section 6.7). In addition extension of 
treatment with mapatumumab will not 
extend beyond the expiry  date of the drug batch 
(March 2016).
During the Extended Access phase, subjects will have regular visits for disease assessments at 
least every  3 months or as per standard of care, whichever is sooner, until disease progression 
is documented. In addition BP will be monitored every  6weeks and recorded in the eCRF. 
Serious AEs will continue to be collected during this Extended Access phase according to 
Section 8. Study  drug administration and inventory /accountability  will continue to be 
recorded during this period according to Section 5. Laboratory assessments will be performed 
as per the standard of care.
6.5 Safet y Follow -up
After discontinuation of study  treatment, all subjects will return at least 30 days after the last 
dose of sorafenib and/or mapatumumab/placebo, for scheduled safet y follow -up assessments 
as outlined in Table 6-1.
6.6 Withdrawal of Subjects from Treatment
Subjects will be free to withdraw from treatment at any time, for any reason, or they may be 
withdrawn/removed, if necessary , to protect their health (see rea sons for withdrawal below). It 
is understood by all concerned that an excessive rate of withdrawals can render the study  
uninterpretable; therefore, unnecessary  withdrawal of subjects will be avoided.
Subjects may  be withdrawn from treatment for any  of the following reasons:
•Radiologic disease progression.
•Continued unacceptable toxicities despite optimal treatment or dose reduction.
•Intercurrent illness, at the investigator’s discretion.
•Withdrawal of consent.
•Non-compliance/Lost to follow -
up.
•Pregnancy .
•Termination of the stud y by the sponsor.
Following subject withdrawal, every  effort will be made to collect safet y information on each 
subject through 30 days following the last dose of study  treatment, unless the subject AM03

share information obtained after the date of withdrawal of consent.
6.7 Withdrawal of Subjects from Study
Subjects may  be withdrawn from the study  for any  of the following reasons:
•Withdrawal of consent.
•Non-compliance/Lost to follow -up.
•Termination of the stud y by the sponsor.
6.8 Disease Response A ssessments
Imaging endpoints will be determined using the modified RECI ST criteria for HCC proposed 
by Lencioni 2010 mRECIST for HCC is a joint guideline of the American Association for the 
Study  of Liver Diseases and the Journal of the National Cancer Institute. 
Lesions which manifest typical imaging characteristics for HCC demonstrate intratumoral 
arterial contrast on CT and MRI images .mRECIST accounts for newer therapies which may 
impact tumor vascularity  and may not yield a typical cytotoxic decrease in tumor size by 
incorporating changes in vascularit y into the criteria for target lesion response. Diligence in 
obtaining images during the hepatic arterial contrast enhancement phase is a requirement at 
baseline and all subsequent scans. The same imaging method must be used at baseline and 
during follow up.
As in conventional RECI ST, overall response is the result of the combined assessm ent of 
target, nontarget, and new lesions. There are also specifications for incorporating portal vein 
thrombosis, portal hepatic lymph nodes, and pleural effusions/ascites into the response 
assessment. As with conventional RECI ST, the appearance of any new lesion overrides any 
existing lesion response, resulting in classification as progressive disease (PD). Key  aspects of 
mRECI ST as adapted for this study  are summarized in Appendix 4 .
Baseline images will be provided to the BICR for confirmation of radiologic eligibility  
(measurable disease). Confirmation of radiologic eligibility  for the study  will be provided to 
the site by the BICR within 72 hours of receipt of images and will be required for 
randomization.
Disease assessments and an assessment of α -fetoprotein will be performed at the end of every 
2 cycles (ie, Cycles 2, 4, 6 and every  2 cycles thereafter). The response assessment will be 
performed and documented no more than 5 days before the start of the next cycle. All images 
will be provided t o the BICR following each disease assessment.
If disease progression is based onl y on new lesions or is equivocal, images will be provided to 
the BICR for confirmation of radiologic disease progression prior to discontinuing study 
treatment. PR and CR will be confirmed at the next scheduled disease assessment (no fewer 
than 4 weeks after the initial documentation of PR or CR).AM03

6.8.1 Disease Response A ssessments for Subjects in the Extended A ccess 
Phase
During the Extended Access phase, subjects will have regular visits for disease assessments at 
least every  3 months or as per standard of care, whichever is sooner, until disease progression 
is documented. Independent radiological review for confirmation of disease progression is not 
required.
6.9 Treatment after the end of the Study
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that consideration has been given to the post -study 
care of the subject’s medical condition, whether or not GSK is providing specific post-study  
treatment
7Pharmacokinetic, Immunogenicity , Pharma cody namic and 
Exploratory  Assessments
7.1 Pharmacokinetic Assessments
For determination of mapatumumab concentration, serum samples will be collected as 
outlined in Table 6-1.
A manual will be provided regarding how to obtain blood samples, process samples, collect 
serum from the blood samples, and how to store and ship the serum samples. Bioanal ysis will 
be carried out at Human Genome Sciences to determine mapatumumab concentration in each 
serum sample.
7.2 Immunogenicity
Blood samples fo
r serum antibodies to mapatumumab will be obtained as outlined in 
Table 6-1. 
7.3 Pharmacody namic A ssessments
Subjects will be given the option to participate in an exploratory  biomarker research 
sub
-study. Consenting subjects will b e asked to provide a historically  obtained biopsy  sample, 
if available, and blood samples. In addition, samples will be requested from subjects who 
undergo a biops y during the treatment period.
To examine and quantify biomarkers present peripherally , blood will be drawn during 
Cycles1 and 2, from which DNA and serum proteins will be isolated. The parameters 
evaluated may include, but may not be limited to, M30, TNFα, sTRAIL, soluble Fas ligand, 
interferon -α, interferon -γ, interleukin -2, interleukin -6, interleukin -8, interleukin -10, 
interleukin -12, and FC gamma receptor and interleukin -6 gene polymorphisms. The 
biomarker sub- study  is detailed in Appendix 6 .AM03

7.4 Exploratory  Assessments (B and T Lymphocy te Subsets)
7.4.1 Rationale for B and T Ly mphocy te Analysis
Over 400 subjects have received mapatumumab in doses ranging from 0.01 to 30mg/kg 
across multiple Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials in subjects with solid and hematologic 
malignancies. While there is no evidence todate that mapatumumab exacerbates adverse 
events associated with chemotherap y, the most commonly  observed laboratory  abnormality  
associated with mapatumumab has been ly mphopenia. The ly mphopenia has been intermittent 
and reversible and was not associated with infectious events. However, the lymphocy te 
subpopulation(s) affected have not been characterized.
The evaluation of lymphocy tes will include complete blood count/differential and ly mphocy te 
subpopulation analy sis (numbers and percentages of T and B cells) by flow cytometry  at a 
central laboratory . Blood samples will be examined by flow cytometry  for levels of T helper 
(CD4+), T cy totoxi c (CD8+) and mature B cells (CD19+).
7.4.2 Collection of Samples for B and T Ly mphocy te Analysis
Blood samples will be colle cted for quantification of B and T lymphocy te subsets on Day 1 
(prior to dosing) and Day 15 of Cycles 1 and 2 as outlined in Table 6-1.
8Adverse Event Reporting
8.1 Definitions
ADVERSE EVENT (EXPERI ENCE) -any unfavorable or unintended sign, symptom, or 
disease that is temporally associated with the use of a study  agent but is not necessarily  caused 
by the study  agent. This includes worsening (eg, increase in frequency  or severit y) of 
pre-existing conditions.
SERI OUS ADVERSE EVENT 
–an adverse event resulting in any  of the following outcomes:
•death
•is life threatening (ie, an immediate threat to life)
•inpatient hospitalization
•prolongation of an existing hospitalization
•persistent or significant disability  / incapacit y
•congenital anomal y/ birth defect
•is Medically  Important*
*Medical and scientific judgment will be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting is 
appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be immediatel y 
life threatening or result in death or result in hospitalization but may jeopardize the patient or 
may require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed above. These should also 
usually  be considered serious. (I CH guidelines, March 1995)
Human Genome Sciences, Inc. Confidential Page 43
Protocol HGS1012 -C1103 Amendment 0 3 Mapatumumab
Note: Hospitalizations not associated with an adverse event, for example, for administration 
of chemotherap y or hydration for chemotherap y administration, are not considered serious 
adverse events.
UNEXPECTED ADVERSE EVENT -An adverse event, the nature or severit y of which is 
not consistent with the applicable product information (eg, Investigator’s Brochure for an 
unapproved investigational product or package insert/summary  of product characteristics for 
an approved product). Expected means that the event has previousl y been observed with the 
study  agent and is identified and/or described in the applicable product information. It does 
not mean that the event is expected with the underl ying disease(s) or concomitant 
medications.
8.2 Reporting A dverse Events to the Sponsor or Designee
The investigator and their designees are responsible for detecting, documenting and reporting 
events that meet the definition of an AE or SAE.
Any SAEs assessed as related to study  participation (e.g., protocol -mandated procedures, 
invasive tests, or change in existing therapy ) or related to a Human Genome Science product 
will be recorded from the time a subject consents to participate in the study  up to and 
including an y follow -up contact.
Investigators are not obligated to activel y seek AEs or SAEs in former study subjects. 
However, if the investigator learns of any SAE, including a death, at any time after a subject 
has been discharged from the study , and he/she considers the event reasonably  related to the 
study  treatment or study  participation, the investiga tor must promptly  notify  GSK CMG .
All adverse events (AEs) that are identified from the start of any study  agent administration 
through the specified study  follow -up period (through 30 day s following administration of the 
final study  agent dose) will be recorded on the paper/electronic Adverse Event Case Report 
Form (AE case report form). All data fields on the AE case report form will be completed.
Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) must ALSO be recorded on the SAE Worksheet and emailed 
to GSK CMG at  (fax backup: within 24 hours of site 
personnel becoming aware of a SAE, regardless of expectedness. All pages of the SAE 
Worksheet will be completed, but the SAE worksheet will not be held until all information is 
available. Additional information and corrections will be provided on subsequent SAE 
Worksheets as described in the Study Procedure Manual. 
8.3 Laboratory  Abnormalities as A dverse Events
A laboratory  abnormality  will be reported as an adverse event if it is associated with an 
intervention. Intervention includes, but is not limited to, discontinuation of treatment, dose 
reduction/delay , additional assessments (excluding follow -up labs), or concomitant therapy . In 
addition, any  medicall y important laboratory  abnormality  may  be repor ted as an adverse event 
at the discretion of the investigator. This includes laboratory  abnormalities for which there is 
no intervention but the abnormal value(s) suggests a disease or organ toxicity . If clinical AM03

PPD
PPD
Human Genome Sciences, Inc. Confidential Page 44
Protocol HGS1012 -C1103 Amendment 0 3 Mapatumumab
sequelae are associated with a laboratory  abnormality , the diagnosis or medical condition will 
be reported (eg, renal failure, hematuria) not the laboratory  abnormality  (eg, elevated 
creatinine, urine red blood cells increased).
8.4 Other Events Requiring Rapid Reporting
Protocol Specified Events are additional events [toxicities ] specifically identified in this 
protocol that must be reported to GSK CMG or designee in an expedited manner. Protocol 
Specified Events may or may not be SAEs as defined in this protocol. They are SAEs if they 
meet one or more of the criteria for an SAE (see Section 8.1). Protocol Specified Events are 
recorded on SAE Worksheets and sent to GSK CMG within 24 hours of site personnel 
becoming aware of the event.
The Protocol Specified Events for the st udy:
•Grade 4 neutropenia for > 7 consecutive daysor febrile neutropenia.
•Grade 4 thrombocy topenia.
•Grade 3 or greater non -
hematologic AEs except transaminase, am ylase and lipase 
abnormalities for which the following criteria apply:
•Grade 4 elevations in transaminases.
•Grade 4 elevations in lipase or am ylase.
•Grade 3 elevations in lipase oramylase associated with clinical/imag ing findings of 
pancreatitis, resulting in chronic damage to the pancreas.
•Any adverse event that results in discontinuation of tre atment if that event is assessed as 
possibly , probabl y, or definitely  related to mapatumumab or sorafenib.
8.5 Reporting a Pregnancy
Any pregnancy  in a female participant or a female partner of a male participant must be 
reported to GSK CMG as soon as the site becomes aware of the pregnancy . All pregnancies 
are reported up to 30 days following the last study  agent treatment. GSK CMG sends an 
acknowledgement memorandum to the principal investigator along with a Pregnancy  
Assessment Form. Additional
Pregnancy  Assessment Form swill be sent to the site every  3 
months for reporting of follow -up information . Pregnancy  assessment forms must be 
completed by the investigator until live birth, elective termination of the pregnancy , or 
miscarriage. The site is responsible for following the subject’s pregnancy to final outcome.
Pregnancies are not considered adverse events. Complications or medical problems associated 
with a pregnancy  are considered AEs and may be SAEs. Complications or medical problems 
are reported as AEs/ SAEs according to the procedure described in Section 8.2.
8.6 Investigator Evaluation of A dverse Events
The Investigator will evaluate all adverse events with respect to seriousness (criteria listed in 
Section 8.1above), severity  (intensit y or grade) and causality  (relationship to study  agent) 
according to the following guidelines listed below.AM01
21Dec10
Human Genome Sciences, Inc. Confidential Page 45
Protocol HGS1012 -C1103 Amendment 0 3 Mapatumumab
SEVERI TY
Severity  will be graded using the NCI-CTCAE, Version 4.0. The NCI-CTCAE may 
be downloaded from the Cancer Treatment Evaluation Program website 
(http://ctep.info.nih.gov/reporting/ctc.html). In the event that an AE does not have an 
NCI-CTCAE code, the following severity  classifications will be used:
Mild causing no limitation of usual acti
vities
Moderate causing some limitation of usual activities
Severe causing inability  to carry  out usual activities
Life Threatening* potentially  life threatening or disabling 
*Note –a severity  assessment of life threatening is not necessaril y the same a s life threatening 
as a “Serious” criterion. The latter means that the event is an immediate threat to life as 
opposed to a potential threat to life.
CAUSALITY
Definitely  Related reasonable temporal relationship to study  agent administration
follows a kno wn response pattern (eg, drug is known to cause this AE)
there is no alternative etiology
Probably  Related reasonable temporal relationship
follows a suspected response pattern (eg, based on similar drugs)
no evidence for a more likely  alternative etiol
ogy
Possibly  Related reasonable temporal relationship
little evidence for a more likely  alternative etiology
Probably  Not Related does not have a reasonable temporal relationship, OR
good evidence for a more likely  alternative etiology
Not Related does not have a temporal relationship, OR
definitely  due to alternative etiology  
ICH guidelines (March, 1995) clarify  “reasonable causal relationship” to mean “that there are 
facts [evidence] or arguments to suggest a causal relationship”.
The causalit y asses sment must be made by the investigator based on information available at 
the time that the SAE worksheet is completed. The initial causality  assessment may  be revised 
as new information becomes available.
*Note -If there is evidence that mapatumumab/plac ebo contributed to or exacerbated an 
event related to sorafenib; the event will be recorded as possibly , probably  or definitel y 
related to both sorafenib and mapatumumab.
Human Genome Sciences, Inc. Confidential Page 46
Protocol HGS1012 -C1103 Amendment 0 3 Mapatumumab
8.7 Follow -up of A dverse Events
Adverse events that occur during the course of the study  are followed until final outcome is 
known or until the end of the safety  follow -up period (30 day s following the final dose of any 
study  agent). Adverse events that have not resolved by the end of the safety  follow -up period 
are recorded as ongoing.
SAEs that have not resolved by the end of the follow -up period are followed until final 
outcome of recovered or recovered with sequelae is achieved . If it is not possible to obtain a 
final outcome for a SAE (eg, the subject is lost to follow up), the reason a fi nal outcome could 
not be obtained will be documented b y the investigator.
8.8 Regulatory  Reporting Requirements for SA Es
Prompt notification by the investigator to Human Genome Science of SAEs and non-serious 
AEs related to study  treatment (even for non
-interventional post-marketing studies) is 
essential so that legal obligations and ethical responsibilities towards the safet y of subjects 
and the safety  of a product under clinical investigation are met. 
GSK CMG has a legal responsibility  to notify  both the local regulatory  authority  and other 
regulatory  agencies about the safety of a product under clinical investigation.  GSK CMG will 
comply  with country  specific regulatory  requirements relating to safety  reporting to the 
regulatory  authorit y, Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) 
and investigators.
Investigator safety  reports are prepared for suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions 
according to local regulatory  requirements and Human Genome Science policy  and are 
forwarded to investigators as necessary .
An investigator who receives an investigator safet y report describing a SAE(s) or other 
specific safet y information (e.g., summary  or listing of SAEs) from GSK CMG will file it 
with the IB and will notify  the IRB/IEC, if appr opriate according to local requirements.
8.9 Reporting Serious A dverse Events to the Institutional Review 
Board/Ethics Committee
All SAEs that are considered unexpected and related to the study  agent will be reported by 
GSK CMG or its designee as expedited (ie, 15- Day) reports to the appropriate regulatory 
authorities AND to all participating investigators. Each investigator must notify  the 
Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) responsible for 
reviewing the study  at their site of all expedited reports. In addition, GSK CMG or its 
designee will follow all applicable local and national regulatory  requirements regarding safet y 
reporting. Each investigator must also comply  with the applicable regulatory  requirements 
related to the repor ting of SAEs to the IRB/IEC responsible for reviewing the study  at their 
site, as well as the regulatory  authority (ies) (if applicable).AM03

9Endpoints and Statistical A nalysis
9.1 General Statistical Considerations
Analy ses will be applied to a modified intention -to-treat population unless stated otherwise. 
This population is defined as the set of all randomized subjects who receive at least 1 dose of 
study  treatment (mapatumumab/placebo and/or sorafenib) with subjects analy zed according to 
the groups they are randomized to, regardless of the treatment they subsequently  receive. 
Additional analy ses may be performed on the as-treated population, defined as the set of 
subjects receiving at least 1 dose of study  medication analy zed according to the treatment that 
they actuall y receive.
Analy ses will be performed using the SAS System™, WinNonlin Enterprise Edition™, 
StatXact™, and the R statistical package.
9.2 Sample Size Rationale
A total of approximately 100 subjects will be randomly  assigned to 1 of 2 arms and treated 
with either sorafenib + placebo or the 2-agent combination of sorafenib and mapatumumab at 
30mg/kg in a 1:1ratio. A sample size of 50 subjects randomized and treated in each group is 
sufficient to estimate the median time to progression with a precision of approximately  
-1.9M 
to +2.6 M relative to the observed median. In addition, a sample size of 50 patients per arm 
will provide 80% power to detect an improvement in TTP from 5.5 to 8.9M with at a 
one-sided significance level of 0.10.
9.3 Efficacy
9.3.1 Primary  Efficacy  Endpoint
The primary  endpoint is time to progression (TTP) defined as the time from randomization to 
radiologic disease progression based on blinded independent review of imaging scans. 
9.3.2 Primary  Efficacy  Analysis
The primary  analysis will be an estim ate of median time to progression in each arm using 
Kaplan Meier methods, reported with 95% confidence intervals, along with testing the hazard 
ratio for time to progression at a 1-sided significance level of 0.10 with a Cox proportional 
hazards model cont rolling for the factors stratify ing the randomization as covariates.
9.3.3 Secondary  Efficacy Endpoints
Secondary  endpoints include progression
-free survival, overall response, disease control, 
overall survival, time to response, and duration of response (for r esponders) as defined below:
•OS: time from randomization to death from an y cause.
•PFS: time from randomization to disease progression or death from an y cause.
•Objective response (CR+PR according to mRECIST for HCC).
•Disease control (CR+PR+SD according to mRECIST for HCC).
•Time to response: time from randomization to 1stPR or CR in responders only .AM01
21Dec10
Human Genome Sciences, Inc. Confidential Page 48
Protocol HGS1012 -C1103 Amendment 0 3 Mapatumumab
•Duration of response: time from 1stPR or CR to disease progression; in responders only .
All secondary  endpoints will be based on blinded independent review of imaging scans.
9.3.4 Secondary  Efficacy Analy ses
Secondary  analyses include estimates, using Kaplan Meier methods, of median PFS and 
median OS along with associated logrank testing. In addition, estimates of overall response 
rate (CR+PR) and disease control rate(CR+PR+SD) will be reported with 95% confidence 
intervals and an estimate of the difference in response rates and disease control rates between 
groups will be reported and tested for significance with a Pearson chi-square test (or Fisher’s 
exact test). 
9.4 Safet y
9.4.1 Definition of Safety  Variables
The safet y parameters assessed are given b y the following:
•Frequency , and severity  of adverse events (AEs):
-All AEs will be classified by  System Organ Class and Preferred Term under the 
Medical Dictionary  for Regulatory Activities ( MedDRA ) system of classification with 
a severit y assigned according to the NCI -CTCAE (Version 4.0, 29 May  2009), or the 
rules specified in Section 8.6.
-Laboratory  parameters as presented in Appendix 7 .
-Laboratory  toxicities will be graded based on the NCI -CTCAE (Version 4.0, 
29May 2009).
•Anti
-mapatumumab antibody  response.
•Vital signs.
•For frequency  and severity  of adverse events and laboratory  toxicity  grading, counts a nd 
rates will be presented.
9.4.2 Human Genome Sciences Safety  Rev iew Committee
The Human Genome Sciences Review Committeee (HGSRC) is comprised of the Department 
Heads of Biostatistics, Regulatory  Affairs and Drug Development. The HGSRC will review 
safet y data after: (1) 10 subjects have completed 1 cycle;and (2) 30 subjects have completed 
1cycle. HGSRC reviews of safet y data will be conducted approximately  every 4  m onths 
thereafter, until 90% of subjects have reached radiologic progression. The HGSRC may 
conduct additional reviews at their own request and/or at the request of the Medical Monitor. 
The HGSRC may request the unblinding of treatment assignment for a subject and/or 
treatment groups. If treatment assignments are unblinded, the rationale for the unblinding will 
be documented.
9.4.3 Analysis of Safety  Variables
The safety  analysis will consist of a presentation of 
rates of AEs observed. Specific AEs will 
be counted once for each subject for calculating rates, but will be presented in total in subject 
Human Genome Sciences, Inc. Confidential Page 49
Protocol HGS1012 -C1103 Amendment 0 3 Mapatumumab
listin gs. In addition, if the same AE occurs multiple times within a particular subject, the 
highest severity  and level of causalit y observed will be reported. If any  associations of interest 
between AEs and baseline characteristics are observed, additional stratified results may be 
presented. All treatment -emergent AEs will be summarized overall, as well as categorized by 
the MedDRA system of classification. AEs will be presented overall, by severit y, by relation 
to mapatumumab/placebo, and by  relation to sorafe nib.
9.5 Pharmacokinetics
9.5.1 Definition of Pharmacokinetic Evaluation
Serum mapatumumab concentration data obtained from this study  will be pooled with data 
obtained from other studies for use in a population PK analysis, which will be reported 
separately .
9.5.2 Analysis of Pharmacokinetics
The serum mapatumumab concentration will be determined by  enzy me-linked immunosorbent

10.2 Institutional Review Board R eview /Independent Ethics Committee 
Review  and A pproval
The investigator or sponsor (as appropriate per national regulations) shall assure that an 
IRB/IEC, constituted in accordance with ICH Good Clinical Practices, will provide initial and 
continuing revie w of the study .
Prior to shipment of the study  agent and enrollment of study  subjects, documented IRB/IEC 
approval of the protocol, informed consent form, and any advertisement for subject 
recruitment must be obtained and provided to the sponsor or designe e.
The IRB/IEC must also be informed of all protocol amendments prior to implementation. The 
investigator must provide reports of any change in research activity  (ie, the completion, 
termination, or discontinuation of a study ) to the IRB/IEC.
10.3 Protocol Comp liance
Except for a change that is intended to eliminate an apparent immediate hazard to a study  
subject, the protocol shall be conducted as described. Any such change must be reported 
immediately  to the sponsor and to the IRB/IEC.
10.4 Protocol Revisions
Protocol amendments will be prepared and approved by  the sponsor. All protocol amendments 
will be signed by the investigator and submitted to the IRB/IEC for review prior to 
implementation. Documentation of IRB/IEC approval must be forwarded to the sponsor or 
designee. If an amendment significantl y alters the study  design, increases potential risk to the 
subject or otherwise affects statements in the informed consent form, the informed 
consent 
form must be revised accordingly  and submitted to the IRB/IEC for review and approval. The 
approved consent form must be used to obtain informed consent from new subjects prior to 
enrollment and must be used to obtain informed consent from subjects already  enrolled if they  
are affected b y the amendment.
10.5 Data Collection and Management
Data collected for each study  subject are recorded electronically  on case report forms 
provided or approved b y the sponsor. 
The investigator is responsible for maintaining accurate, complete, and up-to-date records for 
each subject. The investi
gator is also responsible for maintaining any source documents 
related to the study , including any films, tracings, computer discs, or tapes. The investigator 
must promptly  review the completed case report forms for each subject. As the person 
ultimately  responsible for the accuracy  of all data, the investigator must sign the Investigator's 
Statement in each subject's case report form.
The anon ymity of participating subjects must be maintained. Subjects are identified by an 
assigned subject number on case report forms and other documents submitted to the sponsor. 
Documents that identify  the subject beyond subject number are not submitted to the sponsor 
Human Genome Sciences, Inc. Confidential Page 51
Protocol HGS1012 -C1103 Amendment 0 3 Mapatumumab
(ie, the signed informed consent document) and must be maintained in strict confidence by  the 
investigator, except to the extent necessary  to allow auditing by the regulatory  authorities, 
study  monitor, or sponsor representatives.
Sites enter subject data directly  into the electronic data capture (EDC) system and the EDC
system automaticall y generates queries resulting from computer checks embedded into the 
system, so as to ensure accuracy , quality , consistency , and completeness of the database. 
Manual queries resulting from review by monitors, medical coders, and other Data 
Management staff are also generated from within the EDC system, where they are tracked. 
Sites resolve the queries and correct the entered data when necessary . Every change to data is 
captured in the EDC system audit trail. At study end, each site is provided with a compact 
disk containing the electronic case report forms for each of their subjects.
Upon completion of the study , or after reaching a pre-specified point in the study , Data 
Management locks the database and generates the SAS datasets necessary  for data analysis 
and reporting.
10.6 Stud yMonitoring
The study  sponsor, Human Genome Sciences, Inc., or designee, will monitor the study . Study  
monitors representing the sponsor will visit study  sites routinel y throughout the trial. The 
sponsor will review the paper subject diaries and electronic case report forms and compare 
them with source documents to verify  accurate and complete collection of data and confirm 
that the study  is being conducted according to the protocol. Auditors representing the sponsor 
may also similarl y evaluate the study  and its monitors. For these purposes, the investigator 
will make paper subject diaries and electronic case report forms and source documents 
available when requested.
In addition, the study  may be evaluated by representatives of the national regulatory 
autho
rities, who will also be allowed access to study  documents. The investigators will 
promptly  notify  Human Genome Sciences of any audits they have scheduled with any 
regulatory  authorit y.
10.7 Drug A ccountability
Upon receipt, the designated unblinded pharmacy  personnel at the study  site areresponsible 
for taking an inventory  of the study  agent, including any buffers or diluents. A record of this 
inventory  must be kept and usage must be documented on study  agent inventory  forms 
provided b y the sponsor.
Study  agent inventory  forms will be examined and reconciled by an unblinded Clinical 
Research Associate, or designee. At the end of the study , all used and unused study  agent 
must be accounted for on a study  agent accountability  form provided to the investigator by 
Human Genome Sciences or its designee.

Appendix 5 Modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Hepatocellular 
Carcinoma (mRECIST for HCC)
(Adapted from Lencioni , 2010 for use in this study)
Measurable disease: The presence of at least 1 target lesion, by contrast enhanced 
computerized tomography  (CT) with use of multislice scanners, or contrast enhanced dy namic 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
Target lesion: Meets all the following criteria:
-Located in the liver .
-Can be accurately  measured in at least 1 dimension.
-Well- delineated area of viable, hypervascular (contrast enhancement in the arterial phase) 
tumor that is > 2 cm in the axial plane.
-Suitable for repeat measurement .
-Not previously  treated with locoregional or s ystemic treatment unless the lesion shows a 
well-delineated area of viable (contrast enhancement in the arterial phase) tumor that is 
>2 cm in the axial plane. (If the lesion is poorl y demarcated or exhibits aty pical 
enhancement as a result of the previous intervention, then it cannot be selected as a target 
lesion).
A maximum of 5 target lesions may  be selected .
Nontarget lesion: Other lesions, including small les ions ( ≤2 cm in the a xial plane). Note that
malignant portal vein thrombosis should be considered a nonmeasurable, and therefore
nontarget, lesion. Lym ph nodes at the portal hepatic can be considered as malignant if the
lymph node short axis is at least 2 cm. Selection of effusion, including ascities, as a nontarget 
lesion is prohibited. Similarly , bone lesions or any other lesion outside the CT or MRI of the 
abdomen or obtained b yother modality , may  not be selected as nontarget lesions.
Measurement of lesions: Imaging studies will be by contrast enhanced CT, with use of 
multislice scanners, or contrast enhanced MRI. The same method must be used at baseline and 
during follow up. Note that the longest diameter of the 
viable tumor is not necessarily  located 
in the same scan plane in which the baseline diameter was measured. The measurement of the 
viable tumor diameter should not include any major intervening areas of necrosis. (Please see 
the HGS1012-C1103 Radiographic Data Collection Manual).
Evaluation of ta rget lesions:
Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of intratumoral arterial enhancement in all target 
lesions.
Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of viable 
(enhancement in the arterial phase) target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of the 
diameters of target lesions .AM01
21Dec10
Human Genome Sciences, Inc. Confidential Page 67
Protocol HGS1012 -C1103 Amendment 0 3 Mapatumumab
Stable Disease (SD): Any cases that do not qualify for CR, PR or PD.
Progressive Disease (PD): An increase of at least 20% in the sum of the diameters of viable 
(enhancing) target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum of the diameters of viable 
(enhancing) target lesions recorded since treatment started.
Evaluation of nontarget lesions:
Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of intratumoral arterial enhancement.
Incomplete Response/Stable Disease (IR/SD): Persistence of intratumoral arterial 
enhancement in 1or more nontarget lesions.
Progressive Disease (PD): Unequivocal progression of existing nontarget lesions.  
Evaluation of new lesions: A newly  detected hepatic nodule will be classifi ed as evidence of 
progression when its longest diameter is ≥ 1 cm and the nodule shows the 
hypervascularization in the arterial phase with washout in the portal venous or late venous 
phase.  
Liver lesions ≥ 1 cm that do not show a typical vascular pattern can be diagnosed as HCC by 
evidence of at least a 1 cm -interval growth in subsequent scans. 
An individual radiologic event will be adjudicated in retrospect as progression at the time it 
was 1stdetected by imaging techniques, even if strict criteria were fulfilled only  on subsequent 
radiologic testing.
Images by another modality  may be obtained, as clinically  indicated post-baseline. Sites may 
conclude that post-baseline images based on another modality  that indicate disease are 
evidence of radiologic progression if:(1) there was no imaging done at baseline ;(2) if there 
was imaging done at baseline showing no disease 
present at that time; or(3)if there was 
imagine done at baseline indicating that the on-treatment assessment represents unequivocal 
worsening. In these cases the disease will be report ed as ‘new lesions’.
All images 
obtained on study  will be provided the BICR for the independent efficacy  read, or 
for confirmation of progression if required or requested.
Evaluation of Overall Response: The overall response is determined at each assessmen t and 
is a result of the combined assessment of target lesions, nontarget lesions and new lesions.

Best Overall Response :
The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of treatment until 
disease progression. To be assigned a best overall response of CR or PR,changes in tumor 
measurements must be confirmed at the next scheduled disease assessment (no fewer than 
4weeks after the initial documentation of PR or CR) .

Appendix 6 Exploratory  Biomarker Sub-study
1.Background
Mapatumumab is a targeted therapy . Presently , the relationship between expression of the 
target, TRAIL -R1, and the anti -tumor activity  of the antibody  is incompletely  understood. 
Studies conducted with cell lines derived from human tumors have suggested that the 
relationship between receptor expression and mapatumumab -induced tumor cell death may  be 
complex. However, studies of human tumor cells in vitro and transplanted into animals may 
not accurately  reflect the relationship between receptor expression and response to 
mapatumumab that may be observed in patients with cancer. One feature of this biomarker 
study  is to compare TRAIL -R1 expression from available biopsy  material. This could allow 
for a greater understanding of patterns of TRAIL -R1 expression in advanced hepatocellular 
carcinoma .
It is also likely that other factors involved in TRAIL -R1 signaling could critically  affect 
response to mapatumumab treatment. A 2ndgoal of this biomarker study  is to evaluate 
biomarkers that may be potential indicators ormodifiers of response to mapatumumab. To 
identify  factors that may indicate that a patient is responding to treatment, serum -based 
markers will be compared before and after treatment. To explore factors that are associated 
with the outcome of therapy  and could be used prior to treatment to predict which patients 
will respond, somatic (inherited) differences that modify  a patient’s drug response will be 
examined.
The information generated from this sub-study  will be used solel y for research purposes to 
impr ove future treatment with mapatumumab. It will not be used to change diagnoses or alter 
therap y. Participation in this sub -study  is optional.
2.Study Objectives and Design
2.1. Indicators of Response
2.1.1. Serum- Based Markers of Response
Induction of cell death in tumor cells can elicit the release of certain biomarkers into the 
serum. These markers can be quantified to evaluate treatment effect. To assess release of 
biomarkers associated with cell death, serum -based assay s will be conducted, including, but 
not limited to, assessments of M30, a fragment of cytokeratin 18 that is generated by 
induction of programmed cell death in epithelial tissues. Other examples of markers of tumor 
cell death that will be examined include the cytokines TRAIL, 
TNFα, solubl e Fas ligand, 
interferonα, interferonγ , interleukin -2, interleukin -6, interleukin -8, interleukin -10, and 
interleukin -12. The levels of these factors will be examined before and after treatment to see if 
they correlate with response to treatment.
Serum will be isolated 
and the level of cytokines and other markers like M30 will be 
characterized. Collection, processing and handling of these samples are described in the 
laboratory  manual.
Human Genome Sciences, Inc. Confidential Page 70
Protocol HGS1012 -C1103 Amendment 0 3 Mapatumumab
Samples collected in this study  will be stored for up to 15 years and may be analyzed with 
samples collected in other studies, but will only  be used for mapatumumab -related research.
2.2. Modifiers of Response
2.2.1. Neoplastic Modifiers of Response
Historically  collected tumor biopsy  material, if available, will be collected from subjects 
during Cycle 1. Samples will also be obtained from subjects who undergo a biops y during the 
treatment period. Samples of resected tumor tissue that has been formalin -fixed and embedded 
in paraffin is acceptable; either tissue blocks or slides may be provided. Frozen samples of 
tumor tissue may also be provided. Biops y material collected from fine needle aspirates may 
be provided; either cell pellets or cy tological slides are acceptable.
Levels of TRAIL receptors will be assessed in biopsy  material using immunohistochemical 
techniques if samples are available as formalin -fixed/paraffin -embedded tissue blocks or 
slides. Historically  obtained biopsy  material or biopsy  material obtained during the treatment 
period that is in the form of fresh frozen tissue or cell pellet samples will be utilized to isolate 
RNA for analy sis of TRAIL receptor gene expression.
Similar techniques will be used to evaluate other potential biomarkers and factors that may 
influence mapatumumab response. These may include butare not limited to caspase 8, AKT 
and Mcl -1.
See the laboratory  manual for collection, processing and handling of these samples.
Samples collected in this study  will be stored for up to 15 years and may be analyzed with 
samples collected in other studies, but will only  be used for mapatumumab -related research.
2.2.2. Somatic Modifiers of Response
Inherited differences in the genes that code for drug targets or components of signaling 
pathway s related to the target can dramatically influence the effect of pharmacotherap y. 
Variations in genes that could potentiall y impact mapatumumab’s activity , including 
polymorphic changes in the Fc gamma 
receptor and interleukin -6 promoter and K-Ras gene 
mutations, will be examined to see if they correlate with response to treatment.
DNA will be isolated from the blood and polymorphisms and mutations in specific 
response -related genes will be characterized. Collection, processing and handling of these 
samples are described in the laboratory  manual.
Samples collected in thisstudy  will be stored for up to 15 years and may be analyzed with 
samples collected in other studies, but will only  be used for mapatumumab -related research.

Protocol HGS1012 -C1103 Amendment 0 3 Mapatumumab
3.Statistical Analysis
Associations will be assessed between candidate biomarkers and treatment outcomes captured 
in the clinical database. Statistical tests to be performed may include Pearson chi-
square 
testing, Fisher’s exact test, ANOVA and ANCOVA. Results of the biomarker sub-study  may 
be reported independent of the results of HGS1012- C1103.
4. S ubject Selection and Withdrawal
Subjects enrolled in the HGS1012 -C1103 research study  are given the option to participate in 
the Biomarkers Sub-study . A subject may withdraw from the sub-study  at any time by 
contacting their Study  Investigator, who will contact the sponsor. The sponsor will destro y 
any remaining sample materials and will send a letter back to the Investigator confirming 
sample destruction. Any data or analysis generated from the sample prior to the request for 
destruction will not be destro yed. However, no new information will be generated from the 
sample and no new anal ysis will be performed.
5.Confidentiality
Information about sub-study  subjects will be kept confidential and managed according to the 
requirements of local privacy  regulatio ns. Information obtained from samples will not be 
returned to subjects and will not be placed in the subject’s medical record.
6.Ethical Considerations
All subjects enrolled in the HGS1012 -C1103 research study  who agree to participate in the 
Biomarker Sub-study  will be asked to sign a separate Biomarker Informed Consent. Choosing 
to not participate in this sub -study  will not affect the subject’s ability  to participate in the main 
clinical trial. The Biomarker Informed Consent will be submitted along with the main 
research study  informed consent for review by the Institutional Review Board/Ethical 
Committee.
7.Publication of Biomarker Results
Any significant findings, based upon the analy sis of aggregate data collected from this 
sub-study  may be published by Human Genome Sciences. Personal identifiers will not be 
used in an y publication resulting from this sub -study .

Appendix 8 Treatment of A llergic/Hy persensitivity  Reactions
In the event of allergic/hy persensitivity  reactions to mapatumumab/placebo, investigators will 
institute treatment measures according to best medical and nursing practice. The grading is 
based upon the NCI -CTCAE Version 4.0.0.
The following treatment guidelines will be employed:
•If chills and fever occur, the infusion will be interrupted. Subjects may  be treated 
symptomaticall y and the infusion will be restarted at 50% of the original rate.
Grade 1 allergic /hypersensitivity reaction (transient flushing or rash, drug fever < 38°C):
•Decrease infusion rate b y 50% and monitor for worsening condition. If the reaction 
worsens, stop the infusion.
Grade 2 allergic/hypersensitivity reaction (rash, flushing, urticaria, dyspnea, drug fever 
< 38°C):
•Stop the infusion.
•Administer bronchodilators, ox ygen, acetaminophen, etc as medicall y indicated.
•Resume infusion at 50% of pre vious rate once reaction has decreased to ≤ Grade 1 in 
severit y. Monitor closel y for an y worsening. If the reaction recurs, stop the infusion.
Re-treatment following Grade 1 or Grade 2 allergic/hy persensitivity  reactions:
•Once the infusion rate has been d ecreased due to an allergic/h ypersensitivity reaction, it 
will remain decreased for all subsequent infusions.
•If the subject has a 2ndreaction at the lower infusion rate, the infusion will be stopped and 
the subject will receive no further treatment with mapatumumab/placebo.
•If the subject experiences a Grade 3 or Grade 4 allergic/h ypersensitivity  reaction at any  
time, the subject will receive no further treatment with mapatumumab/placebo.
•If there are questions concerning whether an observed reaction is a n 
allergic/h ypersensitivity  of Grades 1- 4, the medical monitor will be contacted immediately  
to assist with grading the reaction.
Grade 3 or Grade 4 allergic/h ypersensitivity  reaction:
•A Grade 3 h ypersensitivity  reaction consists of s ymptomatic bronchospa sm requiring 
parenteral medications with or without urticaria, allergy -related edema/angioedema, or 
asymptomatic hy potension not requiring treatment.
•A Grade 4 h ypersensitivity  reaction (ie, anaph ylaxis) is a life -threatening event 
characterized b y the sam e symptoms as in a Grade 3 reaction but also complicated by  
symptomatic hy potension or oxy gen saturation of 90% or less.
Human Genome Sciences, Inc. Confidential Page 74
Protocol HGS1012 -C1103 Amendment 03 Mapatumumab
Treatment of Grade 3 or Grade 4 allergic/h ypersensitivity  reaction:
•Stop the infusion immediately  and disconnect infusion tubing from the subject.
•Administer epinephrine, bronchodilators, antihistamines, glucocorticoids, intravenous 
fluids, vasopressor agents, oxy gen, etc, as medically  indicated.

Study Synopsis: Study Design and Schedule, parag
raph 3 
Formerly:
Subjects will continue to receive study  treatment(s) until radiologic disease progression or 
unacceptable toxicity . Subjects unable to tolerate sorafenib may continue to receive 
mapatumumab/placebo every  21 days until radiographic progres sion. Subjects unable to 
tolerate mapatumumab/placebo may continue to receive sorafenib until radiographic 
progression. All subjects will have an end of treatment visit at least 30 days after the last dose 
of sorafenib and/or mapatumumab/placebo whichever is later. After discontinuation of 
treatment, subjects will continue to be followed for radiologic disease assessments every 
6weeks, starting 6 weeks after the previous disease assessment while on treatment, until 
documented radiologic disease progression (if not previously  documented) and then every  
3months thereafter for survival until at least 90% of the subjects have met the survival 
endpoint.
Disease Assessments:
Radiologic disease assessments along with assessment of alpha fetoprotein will be perfor med 
at the end of every  two 21-day cycles (ie, Cycles 2, 4, 6 and every  2 cycles thereafter). The 
disease assessment will be performed and documented no earlier than 5 days before the start 
of the next cycle. Clinical responses will be evaluated according to mRECI ST for HCC (see 
Section 6.7 and Appendix 5). The same assessment method will be used throughout the study  
for each subject. If disease progression is based only on new lesions or is equivocal, images 
will be provided to the blinded, independent, central reader (BICR) for confirmation of 
disease progression. Partial response (PR) and complete response (CR) will be confirmed at 
the next scheduled disease assessment (no fewer than 4 weeks after the initial documentation 
of PR or CR). All imaging scans used for disease assessments will be made available for 
independent radiology  review by  the Sponsor or designee.
Safety  Assessments:
The safety  of sorafenib and mapatumumab will be assessed by evaluation of the type, 
frequency , and severit y of adverse even ts (ie, according to the NCI-CTCAE Version 4.0 
grading) and changes in clinical laboratory  tests (hematology  and clinical chemistry ) and 
immunogenicit y over time. In the event that an adverse event does not have an NCI CTCAE 
Version 4.0 grading, the severi ty grades in Section 8.6 will be used. Adverse events (including 
Human Genome Sciences, Inc. Confidential Page 77
Protocol HGS1012 -C1103 Amendment 03 Mapatumumab
serious adverse events) will be captured from the start of study  agent administration (sorafenib 
and/or mapatumumab/placebo) through at least 30 days following the last dose of sorafenib 
and/or mapatumumab/placebo, whichever is later. Laboratory  assessments will be performed 
at screening, and during each stud y visit outlined in the study  calendar found in Section 6.3.
Modified to:
Subjects will continue to receive study  treatment(s) until radiologic disease progression or 
unacceptable toxicity . Subjects unable to tolerate sorafenib may continue to receive 
mapatumumab/placebo every  21 days until radiographic progression. Subjects unable to 
tolerate mapatumumab/placebo may continue to receive sorafenib until radiographic 
progression. Subjects who completed more than 24 months of study treatment with 
sorafenib with or without mapatumumab and who in the opinion of the investigator 
obtain clinical benefit from treatment, will be allowed to continue treatment with 
sorafenib with or without unblinded mapatumumab in the clinical trial.  This extension 
of treatment will continue until the subject’s disease progresses or they withdraw from 
study. In addition extension of treatment with mapatumumab will not extend beyond the 
expiry date of the drug batch (March 2016).   
All subjects will have an end of treatment visit at least 30 days after the last dose of sorafenib 
and/or mapatumumab/placebo whichever is later. . After discontinuation of treatment, subject s 
will continue to be followed for radiologic disease assessments every  6weeks, starting 6 
weeks after the previous disease assessment while on treatment, until documented radiologic 
disease progression (if not previously  documented) and then every  3mont hs thereafter for 
survival until at least 90% of the subjects have met the survival endpoint.
During the Extended Access phase, subjects will have regular visits for assessment of 
disease response at least every 3 months or as per standard of care, whiche ver is sooner. 
In addition, BP will be monitored every 6weeks and recorded in the eCRF. Serious AEs 
will continue to be collected during this Extended Access phase according to Section 8. 
Study drug administration and inventory/accountability will continu e to be recorded 
during this period according to Section 5. 
Disease Assessments:
Radiologic disease assessments along with assessment of alpha fetoprotein will be performed 
at the end of every  two 21-day cycles (ie, Cycles 2, 4, 6 and every  2 cycles there after). The 
disease assessment will be performed and documented no earlier than 5 days before the start 
of the next cycle. Clinical responses will be evaluated according to mRECI ST for HCC (see 
Section 6.7 and Appendix 5). The same assessment method will be used throughout the study  
for each subject. If disease progression is based only on new lesions or is equivocal, images 
will be provided to the blinded, independent, central reader (BICR) for confirmation of 
disease progression. Partial response (PR) andcomplete response (CR) will be confirmed at 
the next scheduled disease assessment (no fewer than 4 weeks after the initial documentation 
of PR or CR). All imaging scans used for disease assessments will be made available for 
independent radiology  review b y the Sponsor or designee.
Human Genome Sciences, Inc. Confidential Page 78
Protocol HGS1012 -C1103 Amendment 03 Mapatumumab
During the Extended Access phase, subjects will have regular visits for assessment of 
disease response at least every 3 months or as per standard of care, whichever is sooner, 
until disease progression is documented. Independent radiological review for 
confirmation of disease progression is not required.
Safety  Assessments:
The safety  of sorafenib and mapatumumab will be assessed by evaluation of the type, 
frequency , and severit y of adverse events (ie, according to the NCI-CTCAE Version 4.0 
grading) and changes in clinical laboratory  tests (hematology  and clinical chemistry ) and 
immunogenicit y over time. In the event that an adverse event does not have an NCI CTCAE 
Version 4.0 grading, the severit y grades in Section 8.6 will be use d. Adverse events (including 
serious adverse events) will be captured from the start of study  agent administration (sorafenib 
and/or mapatumumab/placebo) through at least 30 days following the last dose of sorafenib 
and/or mapatumumab/placebo, whichever islater. Laboratory  assessments will be performed 
at screening, and during each study  visit outlined in the study  calendar found in Section 6.3. 
During the Extended Access phase, laboratory assessments will be performed as per 
standard of care; SAEs will co ntinue to be collected according to Section 8.

Formerly:
Estimated Study  Duration:
The study  is estimated to occur over approximately  24 months. Subjects will continue to 
receive sorafenib with or without mapatumuma b/placebo until radiologic disease progression 
or unacceptable toxicity . Estimated median length of subject treatment is 6-8 months. All

will continue to be followed for radiologic disease assessments every  6 weeks (± 3 days), 
starting 6 weeks after the previous disease assessment while on treatment, until documented 
radio logic disease progression (if not previousl y documented). Thereafter, subjects will be 
followed every  3  m onths for survival until at least 90% of subjects have met the survival 
endpoint.
Modified to:
The study  is estimated to occur over approximately  24 months. Subjects will continue to 
receive sorafenib with or without mapatumumab/placebo until radiologic disease progression 
or unacceptable toxicity . Estimated median length of subject treatment is 6-8 months. 
Subjects who completed more than 24 months of study treatment with mapatumumab 
and/or sorafenib and who in the opinion of the investigator obtain clinical benefit from  
treatment, will be allowed to continue treatment with unblinded mapatumumab and/or 
sorafenib in the clinical trial.  This extension of treatment will continue until the 
subject’s disease progresses or they withdraw from study. In addition extension of

treatment with mapatumumab will not extend beyond the expiry date of the drug batch 
(March 2016).
All subjects will have an End of Treatmen t visit at least 30 days after the last dose of 
sorafenib and/or mapatumumab/placebo, whichever is later for scheduled safety follow -up 
assessments. After discontinuation of treatment, subjects will continue to be followed for 
radiologic disease assessment s every  6 w eeks (± 3 days), starting 6 weeks after the previous 
disease assessment while on treatment, until documented radiologic disease progression (if 
not previously  documented). Thereafter, subjects will be followed every  3 months for survival 
until a t least 90% of subjects have met the survival endpoint.
During the Extended Access phase, subjects will have regular visits for disease 
assessments according to local standard of care. The response assessment will be 
performed and documented at 12 week intervals (± 6 days). In addition BP will be 
monitored every 6weeks and recorded in the eCRF. Serious AEs will continue to be 
collected during this Extended Access phase according to Section 8. Study drug 
administration and inventory/accountability will continue to be recorded during this 
period according to Section 5.

advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. 
• To determine serum mapatumumab concentrations. 
 Diagnosis & Inclusion Criteria: 
Subjects enrolled in the study must m eet the following inclusion criteria: 
1. Child-Pugh Class A (see Appendix 1). 
2. Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) advanced stage (C) hepatocellular carcinoma, or 
BCLC intermediate stage (B) hepatocellular carcinoma if treatment with transarterial chemoembolization is not considered appropriate (see Appendix 2). 
3. Measurable disease demonstrati ng intratumoral arterial enha ncement by contrast enhanced 
computerized tomography (CT), with use of multislice scanners, or contrast enhanced 
dynamic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), with at least 1 tumor lesion that meets the following criteria: - Located in the liver. 
- Can be accurately measured in at least 1 dimension. 
- Well delineated area of viable , hypervascular (contrast enhancement in the arterial 
phase) tumor that is > 2 cm in the axial plane.

 Study Design and Schedule: 
This is a Phase 2, multi-cen ter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to 
evaluate the efficacy and safety of mapatumuma b in combination with sorafenib in subjects 
with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. In addition to receiving sorafenib, subjects will be 
randomly assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups in a 1:1 ratio to receive 30 mg/kg mapatumumab or placebo. 
Randomization will be stratified according to BCLC advanced stage C vs BCLC intermediate 
stage B and ECOG performance status (0 vs 1, 2).  Approximately 100 advanced HCC subject s will be randomized/enrolled.   
Human Genome Sciences, Inc. Confidential Page 6 
Protocol HGS1012-C1103 Amendment 02  Mapatumumab 
 
Study Treatment: 
Mapatumumab will be supplied in open labe l vials and third party unblinding will be 
employed. The study agent will be reconstituted by the unblinded site pharmacist or unblinded 
designee. The unblinded site pharmacist or un blinded designee will also be the person 
responsible for receiving and dispensing study  agent but independent of all other study 
activities. All other study personnel, the subject, the Sponsor will remain blinded to the study 
agent received. Separate monitors will be responsible for the clinical (blinded monitor) and study agent (unblinded monito r) aspects of the study. 
Subjects will receive treatment every 21 days (ie, a cycle) as outlined below: 
Arm A:  Sorafenib 400 mg orally twice da ily continuously in each cycle + placebo 
intravenously on Day 1 of each cycle. 
Arm B: Sorafenib 400 mg orally twice daily  continuously + mapatumumab (30 mg/kg) 
intravenously on Day 1 of each cycle. 
Subjects will continue to receive study treatment (s) until radiologic di sease progression or 
unacceptable toxicity. Subjects unable to tole rate sorafenib may continue to receive 
mapatumumab/placebo every 21 days until ra diographic progression. Subjects unable to 
tolerate mapatumumab/placebo may continue to receive sorafenib until radiographic 
progression. All subjects will have an end of treatment visit at least 30 days after the last dose of sorafenib and/or mapatumumab/placebo whichever is later. Af ter discontinuation of 
treatment, subjects will continue to be fo llowed for radiologic disease assessments every 
6 weeks, starting 6 weeks after the previous disease assessment while on treatment, until 
documented radiologic disease progression (if not previously documented) and then every 
3 months thereafter for survival until at least 90% of the subjects have met the survival endpoint. 
Disease Assessments: Radiologic disease assessments along with assessm ent of alpha fetoprotein will be performed 
at the end of every two 21-day cycles (ie, Cycles  2, 4, 6 and every 2 cycles thereafter). The 
disease assessment will be performed and documented no earlier than 5 days before the start 
of the next cycle. Clinical responses will be evaluated according to mRECIST for HCC (see 
Section 6.7 and Appendix 5). The same assessment method will be used throughout the study 
for each subject. If disease progression is base d only on new lesions or is equivocal, images 
will be provided to the blinded, independent, central reader (BICR) for confirmation of disease progression. Partial response (PR) and complete response (CR) will be confirmed at 
the next scheduled disease assessment (no fewer than 4 weeks after the initial documentation of PR or CR). All imaging scans used for disease assessments will be made available for independent radiology review by the Sponsor or designee. 
Human Genome Sciences, Inc. Confidential Page 7 
Protocol HGS1012-C1103 Amendment 02  Mapatumumab 
 
Safety Assessments: 
The safety of sorafenib and mapatumumab wi ll be assessed by evaluation of the type, 
frequency, and severity of adverse events (ie, according to the NCI-CTCAE Version 4.0 
grading) and changes in clinic al laboratory tests (hematology and clinical chemistry) and 
immunogenicity over time. In the event that an  adverse event does not have an NCI-CTCAE 
Version 4.0 grading, the se verity grades in Section 8.6 will be used. Adverse events (including 
serious adverse events) will be captured from the start of study agent administration (sorafenib 
and/or mapatumumab/placebo) through at least 30 days following the last dose of sorafenib 
and/or mapatumumab/placebo, whichever is late r. Laboratory assessments will be performed 
at screening, and during each study visit outl ined in the study calendar found in Section 6.3. 
The Human Genome Sciences Re view Committeee (HGSRC) is co mprised of the Department 
Heads of Biostatistics, Regulatory Affairs and Drug Development. The HGSRC will review safety data after: (1) 10 subjects have comple ted 1 cycle; and (2) 30 subjects have completed 
1 cycle. HGSRC reviews of safety data will  be conducted approximately every 4 months 
thereafter, until 90% of subjects have reached radiologic progression. The HGSRC may 
conduct additional reviews at thei r own request and/or at the re quest of the Medical Monitor. 
The HGSRC may request the un blinding of treatment assignment for a subject and/or 
treatment groups. If treatment assignments are unblinded, the rationale for the unblinding will 
be documented. 
Immunogenicity: Blood samples for serum antibodies to mapatumumab will be obtained as outlined in  
Table 6-1 . 
Dose Modification/Delay: 
Dose modifications will not be allowed for mapatumumab/placebo. Dose modifications of 
sorafenib for toxicity will be made according to the guidelines provided in the treatment 
section (Section 5.2.3) of the protocol. 
Details regarding pre-treatment and manageme nt of hypersensitivity reactions related to 
mapatumumab are provided in Section 5.1.5 and Appendix 8. 
Pharmacokinetics: 
Multiple blood specimens will be obtained from subjects for serum mapatumumab 
concentration determinations as outlined in Table 6-1 . 
Pharmacodynamics: 
Subjects will be given the optio n to participate in a biomarke r research sub-study. Consenting 
subjects will be asked to provide a historic ally obtained biopsy samp le, if available, and 
several blood samples. In addition, samples will be requested from subjects who undergo a 
biopsy during the treatment period. 
Human Genome Sciences, Inc. Confidential Page 8 
Protocol HGS1012-C1103 Amendment 02  Mapatumumab 
 
To examine biomarkers present peripherally, blood will be drawn during Cycles 1 and 2, from 
which DNA and serum proteins will be isolat ed. The biomarker sub-study is detailed in 
Appendix 6. 
Exploratory Assessments: Blood samples will be collected for quantification of B and T lymphocyte subsets on Day 1 
(prior to dosing) and Day 15 of Cycles 1 and 2. 
Study Endpoints: The following will be evaluated (these endpoints and the respective analyses are defined in 
Section 9): 
Primary: 
• Time to progression (TTP). 
 Secondary: 
• Overall survival. 
• Progression-free survival. 
• Objective response (complete response  [CR] + partial response [PR]). 
• Disease control (CR + PR + stable disease [SD]). 
• Response duration and time to response in responders. 
• Frequency and severity of treat ment-emergent adverse events. 
• Laboratory parameters. 
• Serum mapatumumab concentrations for use in a population pharmacokinetic analysis. 
 Statistical Methods: 
Sample Size: A total of approximately 100 subjects will be randomly assigned to 1 of 2 arms and treated 
with either sorafenib + placebo or the 2-agent combination of sorafenib and mapatumumab at 30 mg/kg in a 1:1 ratio. A sample size of 50 subjects randomized and treated in each group is sufficient to estimate the median time to progre ssion with a precision of approximately -1.9 M 
to +2.6 M relative to the observed median. In  addition, a sample size of 50 patients per arm 
will provide 80% power to detect an improveme nt in TTP from 5.5 to 8.9 M with at a 
one-sided significance level of 0.10. 
Statistical Analysis: The primary analysis will be an estimate of median time to progressi on in each arm using 
Kaplan Meier methods, reported with 95% c onfidence intervals, al ong with testing the 
hazard ratio for time to progression at a 1-sided significance level of 0.10 with a Cox

proportional hazards model controlling for the factors stratifying the randomization as 
covariates. Secondary analyses  include estimates, using Kaplan Meier methods, of median 
progression-free survival (PFS) and median overall survival (OS) along with associated logrank testing. In addition, estimates of ove rall response rate (CR+PR) and disease control 
rate (CR+PR+SD) will be reported with 95% confidence intervals a nd an estimate of the 
difference in response rates and disease contro l rates between groups will be reported and 
tested for significance with a Pearson chi-square test (or Fisher’s exact test). For frequency 
and severity of adverse events and laborator y toxicity grading, counts and rates will be 
presented. 
Study Calendar: The study calendar is located in Section 6.3 of the protocol.

1 Background 
1.1 Hepatocellular Carcinoma 
Hepatocellular carcinoma is the 5th most common cancer worldwide accounting for 2% of all 
malignancies. It is the 3rd leading cause of cancer-related death globally with 1 million new 
cases a year (WHO, 2007; IACR, 2002; Fe rlay et al, 2004; Lopez et al, 2006). 
Hepatocellular carcinoma is more prevalent in ma les with a male:female ratio as high as 8:1. 
Depending on the endemic risk factors, hepato cellular carcinoma is diagnosed during the 
4th through 6th decades of life. The reported incide nce of  hepatocellular carcinoma is 
increasing because of a better ability to diagnose the diseas e and because of the long-term 
consequences of hepatitis C virus (HCV) and he patitis B virus (HBV) infection (Reis et al, 
2006). Worldwide the most common cause of hepatocellular carcinoma is chronic HBV 
infection (El-Serag et al, 2003). Endemic ar eas thus include China, South Asia and 
South Africa where the incidence of hepatocellu lar carcinoma can be as high as 120 cases 
per 100,000. In the United States, where HCV and alcohol are the main risk factors, 
the age-adjusted incidence rates have incr eased from 1.4 cases per 100,000 in 1980 to a 
current incidence of 4 cases per 100,000. Th is equates to about 8500-11,000 new cases 
diagnosed each year (IACR, 2002; Ferlay et al, 2004; Pawlik et al, 2004 ; Edwards, et al, 2005; 
Jemal et al, 2007; Bosch et al, 2004). 
1.2 Treatment Options for Patient s with Hepatocellular Carcinoma 
Surgery, including transplantation, is the only curative modality for hepatocellular carcinoma 
(Venook, 1994; Cha et al, 2003). The 5-year surv ival rate for patients with unresectable 
hepatocellular carcinoma is 11% in the US (ACS, 2007), < 8% in Europe (Capocaccia et al, 
2007), and < 10% in Asia (Teo and Fock, 2001). Symptomatic hepatocellular carcinoma has a 
very poor prognosis with a median survival of  1–8 months (Former et al, 2006; Llovet et al, 
1999a, b). 
Sorafenib, a multikinase inhibitor, is the 1st systemic therapy to significantly impact survival 
in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma, as demonstrated in an international, 
multicenter Phase 3, placebo-controlled trial (L lovet et al, 2007). Sora fenib was approved in 
the United States and European Union for the 1st-line treatment of advanced hepatocellular 
carcinoma in late 2007 and th e 2008 National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines 
have been updated with the addition of sorafe nib as a treatment option for hepatocellular 
carcinoma patients. The updated Barcelona C linic Liver Cancer (BCLC) guidelines 
recommend sorafenib for hepatocellular carcinoma patients with BCLC Advanced Stage (C) (Forner et al, 2010). 
1.3 The Role of the TRAIL Pathway in HCC 
1.3.1 TRAIL and TRAIL Receptors 
TRAIL is a member of the tumor necrosis f actor (TNF) ligand superf amily, with homology 
to Fas/Apo1 ligand (Pitti et al, 1996; W iley et al, 1995). TRAIL induces programmed 
cell death primarily in tumor cells through activation of TRAIL death receptors, TRAIL-R1 
(death receptor 4) or TRAIL-R2 (death receptor 5) (Ashkenazi et al, 1999; Evdokiou et al, 
Human Genome Sciences, Inc. Confidential Page 17 
Protocol HGS1012-C1103 Amendment 02  Mapatumumab 
 
2002; Kothny-Wilkes et al, 1998; Lawrence et al , 2001; Pitti et al, 1996; Walczak et al, 1999; 
Wiley et al, 1995). 
TRAIL-R1, the target of mapatumumab, is detect able on tumor cells derived from colon, lung, 
liver, gastric, pancreas, uterus and esophagus and in tissue sections from various tumors of the 
colon, lung, pancreas, liver and stomach without significant expression in parallel normal 
tissues (Halpern et al, 2004; Roach et al, 2004). 
1.3.2 TRAIL and HBV/HCV Infection 
Acutely infected tissues, including the liver, ut ilize the TRAIL pathway to eliminate virally 
and bacterially infected cells (Herr et al, 20 07). In viral hepatitis, TRAIL and 1 of its 
receptors, TRAIL-R2, are upregulated and cont ribute to the elimination of infected 
hepatocytes associated with viral hepatitis (B antel and Schulze-Osthoff, 2003; Lin et al, 2002; 
Matsuda et al, 2005). In addition to HBV and HCV infection, steat osis, exposure to bile acids 
and chronic alcohol exposure induce increase d expression of TRAIL and TRAIL-R2, but not 
TRAIL-R1, in human hepatocytes (Dunn et al, 2007; Mundt et al, 2005). Cell surface 
expression of TRAIL-R2, but not TRAIL-R1, was altered and responsible for sensitization to 
TRAIL in hepatocytes exposed to  bile acids (Higuchi et al, 2001; Malhi et al, 2007). These 
findings have been reproduced in preclinical models. Non-virally infected hepatocytes are 
refractory to TRAIL and TRAIL- R agonists but exposure of HC V-infected hepatocytes to 
TRAIL leads to a significant level of apoptosis  (Volkmann  et al, 2007). Inhibition of the 
TRAIL pathway may protect infected cells from  apoptosis and allow for chronic infection 
(Mundt et al, 2003). Recent non-clinical observations  demonstrated that natural killer cells 
expressing the ligand TRAIL, are enriched in the livers of patients with chronic HBV 
infection, and TRAIL is overexpr essed in the livers of patients with HCV-associated steatosis 
(Mundt et al, 2005).  
In summary, preclinical data suggest that mapatumumab may promote apoptosis of cancer 
cells, including hepatocellular carcinoma cells. Whether viral infectio n, including HBV or 
HCV infection, will attenuate or  modulate the effects of mapatumumab on hepatocytes is not 
yet known, but experience to date in a Phase 1b trial of mapatumumab in combination with 
sorafenib in subjects with advanced hepatoce llular carcinoma who are positive for hepatitis B 
surface antigen or hepatitis C antibody indicates that the safety experience is consistent with 
underlying disease and known sora fenib toxicities (see Section 1.2). 
1.4 Mapatumumab 
1.4.1 Mapatumumab Pharmacology 
Mapatumumab is a fully human, agonist monoc lonal antibody that activ ates the cell death 
pathway in tumor cells by specifically binding to TRAIL-R1 with high affinity. 
Mapatumumab efficiently induces apoptosis in human cancer cell lines expressing the 
TRAIL-R1 protein on the cell surface. Nonc linical studies have demonstrated that 
mapatumumab can induce cytotoxicity in multiple  tumor cell lines representing both solid and 
hematological malignancies, including cancers of the biliary tract, colon, lung, breast, pancreas, esophagus, ovary, kidney, uterus, as  well as lymphoma and various leukemias. 
Mapatumumab has also demonstrated anti-tum or activity as a single agent, preventing 
Human Genome Sciences, Inc. Confidential Page 18 
Protocol HGS1012-C1103 Amendment 02  Mapatumumab 
 
tumor growth and in some cases causing regressi on of tumors in xenograft tumor models of 
multiple human malignancies, including lung, colon, kidney, and uterus (Camidge, 2007; 
Georgakis et al, 2005; Jin et al, 2007; Humphr eys, 2004; Marini et al, 2006; Menoret et al, 
2006; Pukac et al, 2005). 
The relationship between receptor expression and response to therapy with mapatumumab 
remains unclear. In vitro studies of cell lines have shown that TRAIL-R1 expression level is 
not a consistent predictor of response to ma patumumab. Although both TRAIL-R1 expression 
and apoptosis in response to mapatumumab are increased in many tumor cell lines as 
compared with normal diploid cells, there are examples of mapatumumab cytotoxicity on cell 
lines with very low levels of detectable receptor, and conversely, mapatumumab resistant cell lines that have relatively high levels of TRAIL-R1 cell surface expression. 
Tumor cell cytotoxic activity can be enhanced  when mapatumumab is administered in 
combination with chemotherapeutics or other anti-neoplastic agents. Enhanced apoptotic 
signaling, in vitro cell killing and in vivo anti-tumor activity have been observed when mapatumumab has been combined with various types of therapeutic agents and treatments including microtubule poisons, anti metabolites,  topoisomerase inhi bitors, proteosome 
inhibitors, platinum agents and radiation. Both the level and spectrum of activity of 
mapatumumab is enhanced in in vitro cyto toxicity and in vivo xenograft studies in 
combination with various chemotherapeutic and anti-neoplastic agents, including a xenograft model of hepatocellular carcinoma in combination with cisplatin and gemcitabine (Camidge, 2007; Pukac et al, 2005; Georgakis et al, 2005; Humphreys, 2004; Jin et al, 2007; 
Human Genome Sciences data on file). 
Please refer to the mapatumumab Investigator’s  Brochure for detailed information regarding 
the nonclinical pharmacology, toxicology, and PK of mapatumumab. 
1.4.2 Non-Clinical Mapatumumab Safety Studies 
To assess the nonclinical safety of mapatumuma b, a 6-month toxicity study, with a 4-month 
recovery period, was conducted in chimpanzees. Mapatumumab was administered 
intravenously at up to 40 mg/kg every 10 days. No mapatumumab-specific toxicity was identified and no anti-mapatumum ab antibodies were detected. 
To assess its off-target effects, mapatumumab was administered intravenously weekly to cynomolgus monkeys, whose TRAIL R1 homolog does not bind mapatumumab. Mapatumumab was well tolerated at doses  of up to 50 mg/kg and was not highly 
immunogenic: of the 40 monkeys treated, 1 developed anti-mapatumumab antibodies. The 
positive response was observed in an anim al in the high dose (50 mg/kg) group. 
In vitro, mapatumumab was found to decrease  viability of normal human hepatocytes, 
although the observed effect was less than that ob served with TRAIL. This  effect was variable 
across donors and did not amplify with increasi ng concentrations of mapatumumab. It should 
be noted that in clinical studies, plasma mapatu mumab concentrations have been achieved that 
are > 1100–fold greater than the minimum exposure  resulting in reduced in vitro hepatocyte 
viability. Despite this, the clinical results do no t reveal evidence of hepatotoxicity in those 
Human Genome Sciences, Inc. Confidential Page 19 
Protocol HGS1012-C1103 Amendment 02  Mapatumumab 
 
studies. Hence it appears that the in vitro hepatocyte viability assay is not predictive of 
mapatumumab effects in vivo. 
1.4.3 Clinical Experience with Mapatumumab 
Over 400 subjects have received mapatumumab in c linical trials to date. Preliminary clinical 
data are available from 218 subjects who rece ived mapatumumab as a single agent at doses 
ranging from 0.01 to 20 mg/kg across 6 clinical trials. 
Based on available data, mapatumumab appears to  be well tolerated and no significant safety 
issues have been observed. Adverse events have generally been mild to moderate in severity, 
manageable, and do not appear rela ted to dose. The most frequently reported treatment-related 
adverse events occurring in > 10% of subjects were fatigue, hypotension, nausea and pyrexia. 
Severe events have been uncommon and generally judged not relate d to mapatumumab. 
Severe events judged at leas t possibly related to mapatumumab have been observed and a 
complete list can be found in the mapatumumab Investigator’s Brochure. Grade 3 or Grade 4 
hematologic, renal, or hepatic laboratory a bnormalities also have been relatively uncommon 
with no significant trend or dose-response evident. Lymph openia was the most commonly 
observed laboratory abnormality, but tended to be intermittent and reversible and was not associated with infectious events. 
In subjects with solid tumors, stable dise ase has been the best response observed with 
mapatumumab as a single-agent. However, 2 complete responses  (CRs) and 1 partial response 
(PR) were observed in subj ects with follicular lymphoma. 
In addition, preliminary clinical data ar e available from 234 subjects who received 
mapatumumab at doses ranging from 1 to 30 mg/kg every 21 days in combination with 
chemotherapy in 5 clinical tr ials (carboplatin/paclitaxel [N  = 100], gemcitabine/cisplatin 
[N = 49], bortezomib [n = 69], or sorafenib [n = 16]. Mapatumumab ha s been generally well 
tolerated; adverse events and laboratory abnormalities have been consistent with those expected with underlying disease or chemothera py. A listing of severe events considered at 
least possibly related to mapatumumab can be  found in the mapatumumab Investigator’s 
Brochure. The most commonly occurring labora tory abnormalities have been hematologic 
(ie, anemia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, a nd leukopenia), as expected  with chemotherapy. 
Grade 3/4 laboratory abnormalities have been relatively uncommon. Higher frequencies of 
Grade 3/4 neutropenia, leukopenia, lymphopenia, and thrombocytopenia have been observed. Data from randomized Phase 2 studies in co mbination with chemotherapy suggest that 
mapatumumab may increase rates of lymphopenia. 
One subject receiving mapatumumab in combination with carboplatin/paclitaxel has 
achieved a CR. Twenty-two subjects receiv ing mapatumumab in combination with 
paclitaxel/carboplatin and 12 subjects rece iving mapatumumab in combination with 
gemcitabine/cisplatin have achieved PRs. Three subjects receiving mapatumumab in 
combination with bortezomib achieved CRs; 25 subjects receiving mapatumumab in combination with bortezomib achieved a PR.

1.5 Rationale for the Evaluation of  Mapatumumab in Combination with 
Sorafenib in Hepato cellular Carcinoma 
Sorafenib is the standard of care for treatment of patients with advanced hepatocellular 
carcinoma. Sorafenib is a multikinase inhibitor that targets the Raf/mitogen-activated protein 
kinase/extracellular sign al-regulated kinase signaling pathwa y, blocks tumor angiogenesis and 
induces apoptosis (Panka et al, 2006; Rahmani et al, 205; Yu et al, 2005; Wilhelm et al, 
2004). Sorafenib was approved by the European Medicines Agency and the Food and Drug 
Administration in 2007 for treatment of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma based on the demonstration of improved overall survival in  the 602 patient randomized, placebo-controlled, 
Phase 3 “Sorafenib Hepatocellular Carcinom a Assessment Randomized Protocol” (SHARP) 
trial. Approximately half the 602 patients had either hepatitis C virus or hepatitis B virus as underlying etiology and 26% had al cohol-related cirrhosis. The median overall survival was 
10.7 months for patients in the sorafenib arm co mpared with 7.0 months for patients in the 
placebo arm (hazard ratio in the sorafenib group, 0.69 95% confid ence interval, 0.55 to 0.87; 
p < 0.001). The median time to radiologic progression was 5.5 months in the sorafenib arm, compared with 2.8 months in the placebo arm (p < 0.0001) (Llovet et al, 2008). Seven patients 
in the sorafenib group (2%) and 2 patients in  the placebo group (1%) had a PR; no patients 
had a CR. 
A 2
nd randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 3 trial wa s conducted in the Asia-Pacific region 
(Cheng et al, 2009). The 226 patients randomly assi gned to sorafenib or placebo in this trial 
appeared to have more advanced disease than those in the SHARP trial, with a higher 
frequency of extrahepatic spread , poorer ECOG PS, and higher leve ls of AFP, but still showed 
a benefit from treatment with sorafenib. The majority (73%) had hepatitis B virus as an underlying etiology. The median overall survival was 6.5 months for patients in the sorafenib 
arm, compared with 4.2 months in the pl acebo group (hazard ratio , 0.68, 95% confidence 
interval, 0.50-0.93; p = 0.014). The median ti me to progression was 2.8 months in the 
sorafenib group, compared with 1.4 months in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.57, 95% confidence interval 0.42-0.79; p = 0.0005). 
The mechanisms of sorafenib and mapatumumab action suggest that these agents could 
interact synergistically. Sorafenib sensitizes human cancer cell lines, including cell lines 
derived from hepatocellular carcinoma, to apoptotic stimuli by reducing expression of apoptotic regulatory proteins; Mcl-1, Bcl-xL, and FLIP (Kim et al,2008; Koehler et al, 2009; Rosato et al, 2007; Liu et al , 2006; Rahmani et al, 2005; Yu et al, 2005). Mcl-1, Bcl-xL 
and FLIP have also been shown to mediate sensitivity of a wide range of tumor cell lines to TRAIL receptor agonists (Meng  et al, 2007; Rosato et al, 2007; Llobet et al 2010; 
Blechacz et al, 2009; Katz et al, 2009; Huang and Sincrope, 2010; and Menoret et al, 2006). 
Recent studies demonstrated the combination of sorafenib with TRAIL or TRAIL receptor antibodies has significant activity  in hepatocellular carcinoma ce ll lines (Koehler et al, 2009) 
and colon tumor xenografts (Ricci et al, 2007) that were resistant to TRAIL and an antibody 
against TRAIL-R2. 
Mapatumumab activity has been evaluated precli nically in hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines 
by in vitro cytotoxicity assays  both as a single agent and in  combination with doxorubicin, 
cisplatin, gemcitabine or sorafenib. Single ag ent mapatumumab activity was observed in 4 of 
Human Genome Sciences, Inc. Confidential Page 21 
Protocol HGS1012-C1103 Amendment 02  Mapatumumab 
 
10 hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines. Increased in vitro cytotoxicity, including examples of 
synergy, were observed in 8 of 10 cell li nes when mapatumumab was combined with 
doxorubicin or cisplatin or the combination of cisplatin and gemcitabine (Humphreys et al, 
2008). Two of these hepatocellu lar carcinoma cell lines were evaluated for in vitro 
cytotoxicity of mapatumumab in combination with sorafenib. One displayed an increase in 
cytotoxicity from 30% to 60% when trea ted with a combination of sorafenib and 
mapatumumab. Importantly, treatment of a prim ary human hepatocyte cell line did not induce 
any apoptosis at doses of mapatumumab that were cytotoxic to hepato cellular carcinoma cell 
lines (  and  [personal communication], 2008; Abdulghani et al, 2008). 
Therefore, collectively, the expression of TRAIL-R1 in hepatocellular carcinoma and 
preclinical activity observed with combinati ons of mapatumumab with chemotherapy or 
sorafenib supports the rationale that this combination may be able to effectively target 
hepatocellular carcinoma. 
1.6 Rationale for Dose Selection 
As of June 2010, mapatumumab has been administered with chemotherapy (ie, carboplatin/paclitaxel, gemc itabine/cisplatin, bortezomib, or sorafenib) to 234 subjects, 
including 61 subjects who received 20 mg/k g and 50 subjects who received 30 mg/kg 
mapatumumab. Based on available data, mapatumumab in combination with chemotherapy is generally well tolerated at dose levels up to a nd including 30 mg/kg, a nd no significant safety 
issues have been observed in the course of the clinical trials even at the higher doses.   
Preliminary PK data are available for s ubjects who received 1, 10, 20 or 30 mg/kg 
mapatumumab in combination with gemcitabine and cisplatin (n = 49), 10 or 30 mg/kg mapatumumab in combination with paclitaxel  and carboplatin (n = 73), and 3, 10, or 
30 mg/kg mapatumumab in combination with sorafenib (n = 17). Serum or plasma mapatumumab concentrations are consistently within the range of expected concentrations predicted from Phase 1 study results in solid tumor patients administered mapatumumab as 
monotherapy. Mapatumumab PK is linear and not  affected by the addition of therapeutic 
agents. As expected, the observed peak and tr ough levels of mapatumumab at 30 mg/kg are 
2 to 3 times higher than those observed at 10 mg/kg. Exposure appears to increase in proportion to dose and exposures for a gi ven dose are similar across studies.  
A Phase 1b dose escalation study of mapatumumab in combination with sorafenib in subjects with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma who are positive for hepatitis  B surface antigen or 
hepatitis C antibody is being condu cted. Safety observations have  been consistent with the 
underlying disease and known sorafe nib toxicities. As of June 2010, 6 subjects have received 
3 mg/kg, 9 subjects have received 10 mg/k g, and 1 subject has received 30 mg/kg 
mapatumumab. The number of cycles completed ranges from 1 to 20; 4/16 (25.0%) of subjects have completed 11 or more cycles. Ad verse events have generally been consistent 
with published reports of the toxicities associated with sorafenib and prev ious experience 
with mapatumumab, as well as underlying disease. The most frequently occurring 
treatment-emergent adverse events, regardless  of severity or attr ibution of causality, 
include diarrhea (10/16, 62.5%), fatigue (9/16, 56.3%), nausea (9/16, 56.3%), and vomiting (7/16, 43.8%). Serious adverse events, regardless of attribution of causality, include 
hypertension, upper respiratory tract infection, atrial fibr illation, hyperbilirubinemia, 
PPD

Protocol HGS1012-C1103 Amendment 02  Mapatumumab 
 
hypoglycemia, and hepatic pain. Severe adverse even ts considered at leas t possibly related to 
mapatumumab or its interaction w ith sorafenib include elevated lipase (3/16, 18.8%), hepatic 
pain (1/16, 6.3%), and thrombocytopenia (1/16, 6.3%). Laboratory abnormalities have 
generally been mild or moderate in severity, manageable, and/or consistent with those expected with chemotherapy or the underlying di sease. The most frequent Grade 3 or Grade 4 
laboratory abnormalities include elevated total bilirubin (Grade 3, 4/16, 25.0%; Grade 4, 
1/16, 6.3%) and lymphopenia (Grade 3, 3/16,  18.8%; Grade 4, 2/16, 12.5%). Additional 
information on the safety experience can be found in the mapatumumab Investigators’ Brochure. 
Based on the information currently available, the safety profile continues to be favorable, 
supporting continued evaluati on of mapatumumab in combination with chemotherapy, 
including sorafenib. The maximum tolerated dose has not been reached in any of the Phase 1 or Phase 2 trials conducted to date. Thus , further evaluation of the 30 mg/kg dose is 
warranted. 
The dose of sorafenib for this study, 400 mg  twice daily, is the approved dose for the 
treatment of unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma. 
2 Study Objectives

received. Separate monitors will be responsib le for the clinical (blinded monitor) and study 
agent (unblinded monitor) aspects of the study. 
Number of Subjects: Approximately 100 subjects with advan ced HCC will be randomized/enrolled. 
Treatment Groups: Subjects will receive treatment every 21 days (ie, a cycle) as outlined below: Arm A: Sorafenib 400 mg orally twice daily continuously in each cycle + placebo 
intravenously on Day 1 of each cycle 
Arm B:  Sorafenib 400 mg orally twice daily continuously in each cycle + mapatumumab

Randomization Randomization will be stratified according to BCLC advanced stage C vs BCLC intermediate 
stage B and ECOG performance status (0 vs 1, 2). Estimated Study Duration: The study is estimated to occur over approximately 24 months. Subjects will continue to 
receive sorafenib with or without mapatumumab/placebo until radiologic disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Estimated median le ngth of subject treatment is 6-8 months. All 
subjects will have an End of Tr eatment visit at least 30 days after the last dose of sorafenib 
and/or mapatumumab/placebo, whichever is later.  After discontinuation of  treatment, subjects 
will continue to be followed for radiologic disease assessments every 6 weeks (± 3 days), starting 6 weeks after the previous disease assessment while on treatment, until documented

The dose of mapatumumab is 30 mg/kg. Mapatumumab dose calculations will be based upon 
the subject’s weight measured on Day 1 or wi thin 3 days before Day 1 of each cycle. The 
planned duration of each treatment cycle will be 21 days. Mapatumumab/placebo will be administered on Day 1 of each cycle. 
Human Genome Sciences, Inc. Confidential Page 27 
Protocol HGS1012-C1103 Amendment 02  Mapatumumab 
 
After reconstitution with sterile water for injection, the calculated mapatumumab dose to be 
administered to the subject will be further di luted in normal saline to a total volume of 
250 mL for intravenous infusion. After adding the reconstituted product, the bag will be 
gently inverted to mix the solution. Following r econstitution and/or dilution in normal saline, 
mapatumumab will be stored at 2-8ºC. The product will be administered to the subject within 8 hours of reconstitution. Refer to the HGS 1012-C1103 Pharmacy Manual for instructions on 
admixing and administering study agent.  
Two hundred-fifty mL normal saline solution for intravenous infusion will be administered as 
placebo for mapatumumab. 
Mapatumumab/placebo will be infuse d at a constant rate over 1 hour. 
Infusion and hypersensitivity reactions may occu r. A suggested pre-medication regimen for 
mapatumumab/placebo consists of diphenhydram ine and acetaminophen administered within 
1 hour prior to the start of the mapatumumab/ placebo dose. Use of a pre-medication regimen 
and alternatives to this regimen are at the investigat or’s discretion. 
Subjects will be monitored closely during and after infusion for any sign of acute adverse 
reaction. If an allergic reaction occurs, see Section 5.1.5 and Appendix 8 for suggested 
medical management. 
5.1.4 Mapatumumab/Placebo Dose Toxicity/Delay 
Mapatumumab/placebo will be discontinued for Grade 4 transaminase elevations of any 
duration if they are considered related to mapatumumab. 
Mapatumumab/placebo may be delayed up to 2 weeks for toxicities considered related to 
mapatumumab as described below or if the investigator believes that a delay in dosing is 
warranted in the interest of subject safety. 
The National Cancer Institute Common Te rminology Criteria for Adverse Events 
(NCI-CTCAE, Version 4.0) will be used to grade AEs. 
• Grade 4 neutropenia for > 7 consecutive days or febrile neutropenia. 
• Grade 4 thrombocytopenia. 
• Grade 3 or greater non-hematologic AEs ex cept transient transaminase, amylase and 
lipase abnormalities for which the following criteria will apply: 
- Grade 3 or Grade 4 elevations in transami nases that do not resolve to baseline or 
Grade 1 before the next cycle. 
- Grade 3 elevations in lipase or amylase associated with clinical/imaging findings of pancreatitis, or resulting in ch ronic damage to the pancreas.  
- Any Grade 4 elevations in lipase or amylase for > 4 consecutive days. 
 If mapatumumab/placebo is delayed for toxi city and the toxicity does not resolve ( ≤ Grade 1) 
or return to baseline within 2 weeks after th e delayed dose was originally scheduled (based on 
a 21-day treatment cycle), the subject will be withdrawn fr om further treatment with AM01 
21Dec10 
Human Genome Sciences, Inc. Confidential Page 28 
Protocol HGS1012-C1103 Amendment 02  Mapatumumab 
 
mapatumumab/placebo. If mapatumumab/placebo is  delayed because the investigator believes 
a delay is warranted in the interest of subject safety and dosing of mapatumumab/placebo is 
not resumed within 2 weeks after the delaye d dose was originally scheduled (based on a 
21-day treatment cycle), the subject will be  withdrawn from future treatment with 
mapatumumab/placebo. Sorafenib dosing will  continue while mapatumumab/placebo dosing 
is held. The subject will continue receiving so rafenib until radiologic progressive disease or 
an unacceptable toxicity occurs, at the discretion of the Investigator.  
Doses of mapatumumab may not be altered. 
5.1.5 Management of Allergic/H ypersensitivity Reactions to 
Mapatumumab/Placebo 
The administration of any recombinant protein has the potential to induce local or system 
immunologic reactions; subjects co uld experience, for example, acute allergic reactions. To 
date, 2 such SAEs have been reported which were considered related to mapatumumab (hypersensitivity and angioedema/facial edema) . In the event of allergic/hypersensitivity 
reactions, investigators will institute treatment measures according to best medical and 
nursing practice. Guidelines for treatment are provided in Appendix 8. 
For a NCI-CTCAE Version 4.0 Grade 3 or Grade 4 hypersensitivity reac tion, treatment with 
mapatumumab/placebo will be discontinued. 
If mapatumumab/placebo is discontinued for Gr ade 3 or Grade 4 hypersensitivity reactions, 
the subject will continue to receive sorafeni b, until radiologic progression or unacceptable 
toxicity. 
5.2 Sorafenib 
5.2.1 Packaging, Labeling, Preparation, and Storage 
Sorafenib is supplied as tablet s, each containing 274 mg sorafenib tosylate, equivalent to 
200 mg of sorafenib. 
The recommended daily dose of sorafenib is 400 mg (2 x 200 mg tablets) taken orally twice 
daily without food (at least 1 hour be fore or 2 hours after a meal). 
Sorafenib will be stored at room temperature (15-30°C, 59-86°F) in a dry place. For country-specific formulation and packaging information, pleas e refer to the instructions 
provided in the sorafenib product labeling. Supplier: Commercially available. 
5.2.2 Anticipated Toxicities with Sorafenib 
Toxicities anticipated with the use of sorafenib include the following: 
• Cardiac: Cardiac ischemia a nd/or infarction, hypertension. 
Human Genome Sciences, Inc. Confidential Page 29 
Protocol HGS1012-C1103 Amendment 02  Mapatumumab 
 
• Dermatologic: Hand-foot skin reaction, rash/desquamation. 
• Hemorrhagic: Increased risk of bleeding. 
• Gastrointestinal: Gastrointestinal perforation. 
• Other: Wound-healing complications, fatigue, weight-loss, alopecia, pruritis, dry skin, 
diarrhea, anorexia, nausea, vom iting, constipation, liver dysfunction and abdominal pain. 
 
Laboratory abnormalities observed in hepatocellular  carcinoma patients tr eated with sorafenib 
include hypophosphatemia, lipase elevations , amylase elevations, hypoalbuminemia, 
international normalized ratio elevati ons, lymphopenia and thrombocytopenia. 
Refer to the product labeling accompanying th e product for information approved in your 
country. 
5.2.3 Alteration of Sorafenib Dose/Schedule Due to Toxicity 
Sorafenib may be reduced or delayed for toxicities considered related to sorafenib as 
described below, or if the inve stigator believes that a reduction in dose is warranted in the 
interest of subject safety. When a dose re duction is necessary, sorafenib dose may be 
reduced to 400 mg once daily. If an additiona l dose reduction is requir ed, sorafenib may be 
reduced to a single  400 mg dose every other day (see Table 5-1 ). A maximum of 2 dose 
reductions of sorafenib will be allowed per subject. Additional dose reductions not mentioned in Table 5-1  will need to be discussed with the medical monitor.

Skin toxicity and hypertension are associated with sorafenib. Guidelines for the management 
of these events are provided in Table 5-2  and Table 5-3 , respectively.  
Skin Toxicity 
Hand-foot skin reaction and rash are common in subjects treated with sorafenib. Management 
may include topical therapies for symptomatic relief, temporary treatment interruption and/or 
dose modification, or in severe or persistent cases, permanent discontinuation. Skin toxicities 
will be managed according to Table 5-2 .

< 10X upper limit of normal, Grade 3 hyperlipasemia or hyperamylasemia without clinical or other evidence of 
pancreatitis, Grade 3 leukopenia, or Grade 3/Grade 4 lymp hopenia may continue sorafenib treatment without 
interruption at the discretion of the investigator.  
 
Sorafenib Discontinuation Temporary or permanent discontinuation of sora fenib will be considered in subjects who 
develop cardiac ischemia and/or infarction or  severe or persistent hypertension despite 
institution of antihypertensive therapy. If a subject experiences a bleeding event that 
necessitates medical intervention or a gastrointestinal perforation, sorafenib will be AM01

Protocol HGS1012-C1103 Amendment 02  Mapatumumab 
 
permanently discontinued. Subjects, who undergo a surgical procedure or intervention to 
decrease portal hypertension, including transju gular intrahepatic porto systemic shunt, will 
discontinue sorafenib. 
If the subject is withdrawn from further treatment  with sorafenib, the subject may continue to 
receive mapatumumab/placebo alone every 21 days until radiologic progression or 
unacceptable toxicity. 
5.3 Concurrent Medicat ions and Therapies 
5.3.1 Allowable Regimens 
Subjects may continue their baseline medication( s). The daily dose of each medication will be 
maintained throughout the study if possible. If for any reason deemed necessary by the 
investigator, a subject requires additional medication(s), the medication(s) route of 
administration and the indication for which it was given must be recorded in the source 
documents. All concomitant medications will be r ecorded on the appropriate case report form. 
Systemic, inhaled and topical steroids used as part of an antiemetic regimen or 
maintenance-dose for non-cancerous disease are permitted. 
5.3.2 Prohibited Medications 
Subjects who require the use of strong CYP3A4  inducers (eg, including but not limited to 
St. John’s Wort, dexamethasone, phenytoin, carbamazepine, rifampin, rifabutin, 
phenobarbital) are not eligible for this study and use of these agents is prohibited as long as 
the subject is receiving sorafenib in this study. 
Subjects will not receive any investigational or noninvestigational cy totoxic chemotherapy, 
hormonal therapy, biological therapy (inclu ding monoclonal antibodies), immunotherapy or 
any locoregional therapy (such as embolization, RFA or percutaneous ethanol injection) to 
treat hepatocellular carcinoma during the treatm ent period. Alternativ e anticancer therapies 
may be administered after radiologic disease progression has been documented, but will be 
avoided if possible during the 30 day safety fo llow up period after the last dose of study agent 
(mapatumumab/placebo and/or sorafenib) whicheve r is last. These medications are allowed in 
the long-term follow-up period after the 30 day safety follow-up period and documentation of radiologic disease progression. 
5.3.3 Prohibited Therapies 
Subjects will not undergo major or  elective surgery during the trea tment period of the study; if 
surgery is required, the subject will be withdrawn from study treatment. 
6 Study Procedures

consent for the use and disclosure  of research-related health information) must be obtained 
before any screening procedures  are performed that are not c onsidered standard of care. 
All of the following assessments must be perf ormed within 28 days prior to enrollment: 
• Obtain written informed consent for participation in the study. 
• Obtain informed consent for participa tion in the optional biomarker sub-study. 
- If consented, obtain tissue block/slides or cell pellet from diagnostic histologic/ 
cytologic sample. 
• Record demographics. 
• Obtain medical history, to include history of all treatments used to tr eat the current cancer 
and all prior cancer treatments. 
• Perform baseline complete physical examin ation including body weight and height. 
• Assess vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, respirat ory rate and temperature). 
• Evaluate performance status (ECOG scale; see Appendix 3). 
• Draw blood for laboratory tests (see Appendix 7): complete blood count with differential, 
chemistry , hepatitis B surface antigen, Hepatitis  B virus DNA, hepatitis C antibody and 
testing for serum pregnancy (all females with an intact uterus [unless amenorrheic for the 
previous 24 months] regardless of age). 
• Obtain radiologic disease and AFP assessments . The method of disease assessment, as per 
mRECIST for HCC (see Appendix 5), will be consistent throughout the study.  
• Obtain electrocardiogram. 
• Record medications used within 28 days before enrollment. 
• Confirm that subject meets all inclusion/exclusion criteria. 
 
6.2 Study Enrollment/Randomization Procedures 
Subjects that meet the eligibility criteria will be randomly assigned treatment by a 
central interactive voice response system in a 1:1 ratio to 1 of 2 treatment arms. The 
randomization will be stratified according to BCLC advanced stage C vs BCLC intermediate 
stage B and ECOG performance status (0 vs 1, 2). The 1st planned dose of sorafenib and 
mapatumumab/placebo will be administered no  more than 3 days following randomization 
and not prior to randomization. All study site personnel (with the exception of the unblinded site pharmacist or unblinded designee), the subjec t, and the Sponsor will remain blinded to the

cycle.  See Appendix 7 for a detailed list of required laboratory assessments. 
2 Pregnancy: Serum test at screening, urine test pre-dose Cy cle 1 Day 1; must be negative to receive treatment. 
3 B and T lymphocyte subsets: Blood samples for quantification of  B and T lymphocytes will be obtained in Cycles 1 and 2 only. S amples will be obtained on Day 1 (prior to dosing) and 
Day 15 of Cycles 1 and 2. 
4 Immunogenicity: Obtain prior to dosing on Day 1 of Cycles 1, 2,  4, 6, every 2 cycles thereafter and at the end of treatment vi sit (at least 30 days after the last dose). On days when 
immunogenicity and pharmacokinetic samples are collected they will be collected together. 
5 Pharmacokinetics: Blood specimens will be collected for determinati on of serum mapatumumab concentra tions from subjects as fol lows:  Cycle 1 (on Day 1 prior to the administration 
mapatumumab/placebo and at the completion of the mapatumumab/pla cebo infusion, and on Day 8), Cycles 2, 4 and 6 and thereafter on each even cycle (prior to dosing on Day 1), 
on the day of each disease assessment, and at the end of treatment visit (at least 30 days after the last dose). On days when i mmunogenicity and pharmacokinetic samples are 
collected they will be collected together.   
6 Biomarkers: For subjects parti cipating in the optional biomarker sub-study, hi storical biopsy samples will be collected, if av ailable, and samples will be collected if obtained during the 
treatment period in Cycle 1 Days 1 (pre-dose mapatumumab), 2, 3, 8 and 15 and Cycle 2 Days 1 (pre-dose mapatumumab), 3, 8 and 1 5. In addition, blood samples will be obtained 
as follows: blood for isolation of DNA will be collected once, pref erably in Cycle 1. Blood for isolation of serum will be coll ected in Cycles 1 and 2 (pre-dose on the day of

 6.4 Follow-up Procedures 
6.4.1 Safety Follow-up 
After discontinuation of study trea tment, all subjects will return 1 day af ter cycle completion 
(approximately Day 22) and at least 30 days after the last dose of sorafenib and/or 
mapatumumab/placebo, for scheduled safety follow-up assessments as outlined in Table 6-1 . 
6.4.2 Long-term Follow-up For subjects discontinuing treatment  prior to documentation of ra diologic disease progression, 
and for subjects who experience stable diseas e or a response (PR, CR) but are no longer 
receiving treatment, radiologic disease assessments will be performed at 6 week intervals 
(± 3 days), starting 6 weeks after the previo us radiologic disease assessment while on 
treatment, until radiologic disease progression is documented. Thereafter, subjects will be followed every 3 months for survival until at least 90%  of subjects have met the survival 
endpoint. 
6.5 Withdrawal of S ubjects from Treatment 
Subjects will be free to withdraw  from treatment at any time, for any reason, or they may be 
withdrawn/removed, if necessary, to protect thei r health (see reasons for withdrawal below). It 
is understood by all concerned that an excessi ve rate of withdrawals can render the study 
uninterpretable; therefore, unnecessary wit hdrawal of subjects will be avoided. 
Subjects may be withdrawn from treatment for any of the following reasons: 
• Radiologic disease progression. 
• Continued unacceptable toxicities despite optimal treatment or dose reduction. 
• Intercurrent illness, at the investigator’s discretion. 
• Withdrawal of consent. 
• Non-compliance/Lost to follow-up. 
• Pregnancy. 
• Termination of the study by the sponsor. 
 Subjects who withdraw are to be followed for radiologic progression as outlined in Section 6.4.2. In addition, every effort will be made to collect safety information on each 
subject through 30 days following the last dose of study treatment, unless the subject withdraws consent and refuses to comply with the protocol stipulated safety follow-up and 
radiologic disease progression assessments, or sh are information obtained after the date of 
withdrawal of consent. 
6.6 Withdrawal of Subjects from Study 
Subjects may be withdrawn from the study for any of the following reasons:

 • Non-compliance/Lost to follow-up. 
• Termination of the study by the sponsor. 
 
Every effort will be made to collect follow-up information on subjects in the long-term follow-up period of the study, unless the subjec t withdraws consent and refuses to share 
information obtained during the long-term fo llow-up period obtained after the date of 
withdrawal of consent. 
6.7 Disease Respon se Assessments 
Imaging endpoints will be determined using th e modified RECIST criteria for HCC proposed 
by Lencioni and Llovet (2010; mRECIST). mREC IST for HCC is a joint guideline of the 
American Association for the Study of Liver Di seases and the Journal of the National Cancer 
Institute.  
Lesions which manifest typical imaging charac teristics for HCC demonstrate intratumoral 
arterial contrast on CT and MRI images. mR ECIST accounts for newer therapies which may 
impact tumor vascularity and may not yield a t ypical cytotoxic decrease in tumor size by 
incorporating changes in vascular ity into the criteria for target  lesion response. Diligence in 
obtaining images during the hepatic arterial cont rast enhancement phase is a requirement at 
baseline and all subsequent scans. The same imaging method must be used at baseline and 
during follow up. As in conventional RECIST, overall response is the result of the combined assessment of 
target, nontarget, and new lesions. There are also  specifications for inco rporating portal vein 
thrombosis, portal hepatic lymph nodes, and pl eural effusions/ascites into the response 
assessment. As with conventional RECIST, th e appearance of any ne w lesion overrides any 
existing lesion response, resulting in classification as progressive  disease (PD). Key aspects of 
mRECIST as adapted for this study are summarized in Appendix 4. 
Baseline images will be provided to the BICR for confirmation of radiologic eligibility 
(measurable disease). Confirmation of radiologic eligibility for the study will be provided to the site by the BICR within 72 hours of receipt of images and will be required for randomization. 
Disease assessments and an assessment of α -fetoprotein will be perf ormed at the end of every 
2 cycles (ie, Cycles 2, 4, 6 and every 2 cy cles thereafter). The response assessment will be 
performed and documented no more than 5 days befo re the start of the next cycle. All images 
will be provided to the BICR following each disease assessment. If disease progression is based only on new lesion s or is equivocal, images will be provided to 
the BICR for confirmation of ra diologic disease progression prior to disc ontinuing study 
treatment. PR and CR will be confirmed at the next scheduled disease assessment (no fewer 
than 4 weeks after the initial  documentation of PR or CR).

 7 Pharmacokinetic, Immunogenicity, Pharmacodynamic and 
Exploratory Assessments 
7.1 Pharmacokinetic Assessments 
For determination of mapatumumab concentration, serum samples will be collected as 
outlined in Table 6-1 . 
A manual will be provided regarding how to obtain blood samples, process samples, collect serum from the blood samples, and how to store and ship the serum samples. Bioanalysis will 
be carried out at Human Genome Sciences to  determine mapatumumab concentration in each 
serum sample. 
7.2 Immunogenicity 
Blood samples for serum antibodies to mapatumumab will be obtained as outlined in  Table 6-1 .  
7.3 Pharmacodynamic Assessments 
Subjects will be given the option to particip ate in an exploratory biomarker research 
sub-study. Consenting subjects will be asked to provide a historically obtained biopsy sample, if available, and blood samples. In addition, samples will be requested from subjects who undergo a biopsy during the treatment period. 
To examine and quantify biomarkers present peripherally, blood will be drawn during 
Cycles 1 and 2, from which DNA and serum pr oteins will be isolated. The parameters 
evaluated may include, but may not be limited to, M30, TNF α, sTRAIL, soluble Fas ligand, 
interferon- α, interferon- γ, interleukin-2, interleukin-6, interleukin-8, interleukin-10, 
interleukin-12, and FC gamma receptor an d interleukin-6 gene polymorphisms. The 
biomarker sub-study is detailed in Appendix 6.  
7.4 Exploratory Assessments (B  and T Lymphocyte Subsets) 
7.4.1 Rationale for B and T Lymphocyte Analysis 
Over 400 subjects have received mapatumumab in doses ranging from 0.01 to 30 mg/kg 
across multiple Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials in subjects with solid and hematologic malignancies. While there is no evidence to date that mapatumumab exacerbates adverse events associated with chemotherapy, the most commonly observed laboratory abnormality 
associated with mapatumumab has been lym phopenia. The lymphopenia has been intermittent 
and reversible and was not associated with infectious events. However, the lymphocyte 
subpopulation(s) affected have not been characterized. 
The evaluation of lymphocytes will include co mplete blood count/diffe rential and lymphocyte 
subpopulation analysis (numbers and percentage s of T and B cells) by flow cytometry at a 
central laboratory. Blood samples will be examin ed by flow cytometry for levels of T helper 
(CD4+), T cytotoxic (CD8+) and mature B cells (CD19+). 
Human Genome Sciences, Inc. Confidential Page 40 
Protocol HGS1012-C1103 Amendment 02  Mapatumumab 
 
 7.4.2 Collection of Samples for B and T Lymphocyte Analysis 
Blood samples will be collected for quantification of B and T lymphocyte subsets on Day 1 
(prior to dosing) and Day 15 of Cycles 1 and 2 as outlined in Table 6-1 . 
8 Adverse Event Reporting 
8.1 Definitions 
ADVERSE EVENT (EXPERIENCE) - any unfavorab le or unintended sign, symptom, or 
disease that is temporally associated with the use of a study agent but is not necessarily caused 
by the study agent. This includes worsening (e g, increase in frequency or severity) of 
pre-existing conditions. 
SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT – an adverse event re sulting in any of the following outcomes: 
• death 
• is life threatening (ie, an immediate threat to life) 
• inpatient hospitalization 
• prolongation of an existing hospitalization 
• persistent or significant disability / incapacity 
• congenital anomaly / birth defect 
• is Medically Important* 
 
*Medical and scientific judgment will be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting is appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be immediately 
life threatening or result in death or result in hospitalization but may jeopardize the patient or may require intervention to pr event one of the other outcomes listed above. These should also 
usually be considered serious . (ICH guidelines, March 1995) 
Note: Hospitalizations not associated with an adverse event, for example, for administration 
of chemotherapy or hydration for chemotherapy administration, are not considered serious 
adverse events. 
UNEXPECTED ADVERSE EVENT - An adverse event,  the nature or seve rity of which is 
not consistent with the applicable product info rmation (eg, Investigator’s Brochure for an 
unapproved investigational product or package insert/summary of  product characteristics for 
an approved product). Expected means that the event has previously been observed with the 
study agent and is identified and/or described in the applicable product information. It does 
not mean that the event is expected with  the underlying diseas e(s) or concomitant 
medications. 
8.2 Reporting Adverse Events to  the Sponsor or Designee 
All adverse events (AEs) that are identified from th e start of any study agent administration 
through the specified study follow-up period (t hrough 30 days following administration of the 
Human Genome Sciences, Inc. Confidential Page 41 
Protocol HGS1012-C1103 Amendment 02  Mapatumumab 
 
 final study agent dose) will be recorded on th e paper/electronic Adverse Event Case Report 
Form (AE case report form). All data fields on the AE case report form will be completed. 
Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) must ALSO be recorded on the SAE Worksheet and sent to 
HGS within 24 hours of site personnel becoming aware of a SAE, regardless of expectedness. 
All pages of the SAE Worksheet will be comple ted, but the SAE worksheet will not be held 
until all information is available. Additional information and corrections will be provided on 
subsequent SAE Worksheets as described in  the Study Procedure Manual. SAE Worksheets 
will be sent by facsimile to the Drug Safety Department at HGS using the fax number listed below. 
FAX #:  
8.3 Laboratory Abnormalities as Adverse Events 
A laboratory abnormality will be reported as an adverse event if it is associated with an 
intervention. Intervention includes, but is not  limited to, discontinuation of treatment, dose 
reduction/delay, additional assessments (excluding follow-up labs), or concomitant therapy. In 
addition, any medically important laboratory abnormality may be reported as an adverse event 
at the discretion of the inves tigator. This includes laboratory  abnormalities for which there is 
no intervention but the abnormal value(s) suggests  a disease or organ toxicity. If clinical 
sequelae are associated with a laboratory abnormality, the diagnos is or medical condition will 
be reported (eg, renal failure, hematuria) not the laboratory abnormality (eg, elevated creatinine, urine red blood cells increased). 
8.4 Other Events Requiring Rapid Reporting 
Protocol Specified Events are additional events [toxicities] specifically identified in this protocol that must be reported to Human Ge nome Sciences or designee in an expedited 
manner. Protocol Specified Events may or may not be SAEs as defined in  this protocol. They 
are SAEs if they meet one or more of  the criteria for an SAE (see Section 8.1). Protocol 
Specified Events are recorded on SAE Worksheets and sent to Human Genome Sciences within 24 hours of site personnel becoming aware of the event. 
The Protocol Specified Events for the study: 
• Grade 4 neutropenia for > 7 consecutive days or febrile neutropenia. 
• Grade 4 thrombocytopenia. 
• Grade 3 or greater non-hematologic AEs except transaminase, amylase and lipase 
abnormalities for which the following criteria apply: 
• Grade 4 elevations in transaminases. 
• Grade 4 elevations in lipase or amylase. 
• Grade 3 elevations in lipase or amylase associated with clinical/imaging findings of pancreatitis, resulting in chr onic damage to the pancreas. 
• Any adverse event that results in discontinuation of treatment if that event is assessed as possibly, probably, or definitely related to mapatumumab or sorafenib. AM01

 8.5 Reporting a Pregnancy 
Any pregnancy in a female participant or a female partner of a male participant  must be 
reported to Human Genome Sciences Drug Safety as soon as the site becomes aware of the 
pregnancy. All pregnancies are reported up to 30 days following the last study agent 
treatment. Human Genome Sciences Drug Safe ty sends an acknowledgement memorandum to 
the principal investigator along with a Pre gnancy Assessment Form. Additional Pregnancy 
Assessment Forms will be sent to the site every 3 months for reporting of follow-up 
information. Pregnancy assessment forms must be completed by the investigator until live birth, elective termination of the pregnancy, or miscarriage. The site is responsible for 
following the subject’s pregnancy to final outcome. 
Pregnancies are not considered adverse events. Complications or medical problems associated 
with a pregnancy are considered AEs and may be SAEs. Complications or medical problems 
are reported as AEs/SAEs according to the procedure described in Section 8.2. 
8.6 Investigator Evalua tion of Adverse Events 
The Investigator will evaluate all adverse events with respect to seriousness (criteria listed in 
Section 8.1 above), severity (intensity or grade) and causality (relationship to study agent) 
according to the following guidelines listed below. 
SEVERITY Severity will be graded using the NCI-C TCAE, Version 4.0. The NCI-CTCAE may 
be downloaded from the Cancer Treatment Evaluation Program website 
(http://ctep.info.nih.gov/reporting/ctc.html). In  the event that an AE does not have an 
NCI-CTCAE code, the following severity  classifications will be used: 
Mild  causing no limitation of usual activities 
Moderate causing some limitation of usual activities Severe causing inability to carry out usual activities Life Threatening* potentially lif e threatening or disabling  
 
*Note – a severity assessment of life threatening is  not necessarily the sa me as life threatening 
as a “Serious” criterion. The latter means that  the event is an immedi ate threat to life as 
opposed to a potential threat to life. 
  
Human Genome Sciences, Inc. Confidential Page 43 
Protocol HGS1012-C1103 Amendment 02  Mapatumumab 
 
 CAUSALITY 
Definitely Related reasonable temporal relationship to study agent administration 
 follows a known response pattern (eg, drug is known to cause this AE) 
 there is no alternative etiology 
Probably Related reasonable temporal relationship  follows a suspected response patter n (eg, based on similar drugs) 
 no evidence for a more likely alternative etiology 
Possibly Related reasonable temporal relationship  little evidence for a more likely alternative etiology 
Probably Not Related does not have a reasonable temporal relationship, OR 
 good evidence for a more lik ely alternative etiology 
Not Related does not have a temporal relationship, OR  definitely due to alternative etiology  
 ICH guidelines (March, 1995) clarif y “reasonable causal relationshi p” to mean “that there are 
facts [evidence] or arguments to  suggest a causal relationship”. 
The causality assessment must be made by the i nvestigator based on information available at 
the time that the SAE worksheet is completed. The initial causality asse ssment may be revised 
as new information becomes available. 
 *Note -  If there is evidence that mapatumumab/ placebo contributed to or exacerbated an 
event related to sorafenib; the event will be recorded as possibly, probably or definitely 
related to both sorafenib and mapatumumab. 
8.7 Follow-up of Adverse Events 
Adverse events that occur during the course of the study are followed until final outcome is 
known or until the end of the safety follow-up pe riod (30 days following th e final dose of any 
study agent). Adverse events  that have not resolved by the e nd of the safety follow-up period 
are recorded as ongoing. 
SAEs that have not resolved by the end of the follow-up pe riod are followed until final 
outcome of recovered or recovere d with sequelae is ach ieved. If it is not possible to obtain a 
final outcome for a SAE (eg, the subject is lost  to follow up), the reason a final outcome could 
not be obtained will be documented by the investigator. 
8.8 Serious Adverse Events Assessed During Long-Term Follow-up 
SAEs that occur after the safety follow-up period (30 days following the final dose of study 
agent) that are assessed by the investigator as po ssibly, probably, or defi nitely related to study 
agent must be reported to Human Genome Sciences on an SAE worksheet, as described in Section 8.2. Post-study SAEs will not be documented on the AE case report form. 
Human Genome Sciences, Inc. Confidential Page 44 
Protocol HGS1012-C1103 Amendment 02  Mapatumumab 
 
 8.9 Reporting Serious Ad verse Events to the Institutional Review 
Board/Ethics Committee 
All SAEs that are considered unexpected and related to the study agen t will be reported by 
Human Genome Sciences or its designee as exped ited (ie, 15-Day) reports to the appropriate 
regulatory authorities AND to all participating i nvestigators. Each invest igator must notify the 
Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics Comm ittee (IEC) responsible for 
reviewing the study at their site of all expedited reports. In addition, Human Genome Sciences 
or its designee will follow all applicable local and national regulatory requirements regarding safety reporting. Each investigator must also comply with the applicable regulatory requirements related to the repor ting of SAEs to the IRB/IEC responsible for reviewing the 
study at their site, as well as the regu latory authority(ies) (if applicable). 
9 Endpoints and Stat istical Analysis 
9.1 General Statistical Considerations 
Analyses will be applied to a modified intentio n-to-treat population unl ess stated otherwise. 
This population is defined as the set of all ra ndomized subjects who receive at least 1 dose of 
study treatment (mapatumumab/placebo and/or sora fenib) with subjects analyzed according to 
the groups they are randomized to, regardless of the treatment they subsequently receive. 
Additional analyses may be performed on the as -treated population, defined as the set of 
subjects receiving at least 1 dose of study medi cation analyzed according to the treatment that 
they actually receive. 
Analyses will be performed using the SAS System™, WinNonlin Enterprise Edition™, 
StatXact™, and the R statistical package. 
9.2 Sample Size Rationale 
A total of approximately 100 subjects will be randomly assigned to 1 of 2 arms and treated 
with either sorafenib + placebo or the 2-agent combination of sorafenib and mapatumumab at 
30 mg/kg in a 1:1 ratio. A sample size of 50 subjects randomized and treated in each group is sufficient to estimate the median time to progre ssion with a precision of approximately -1.9 M 
to +2.6 M relative to the observed median. In  addition, a sample size of 50 patients per arm 
will provide 80% power to detect an improveme nt in TTP from 5.5 to 8.9 M with at a 
one-sided significance level of 0.10.  
9.3 Efficacy 
9.3.1 Primary Efficacy Endpoint 
The primary endpoint is time to progression (TTP) defined as the time from randomization to 
radiologic disease progression based on blinded independent review of imaging scans.  
9.3.2 Primary Efficacy Analysis 
The primary analysis will be an estimate of median time to progressi on in each arm using 
Kaplan Meier methods, reported with 95% confid ence intervals, along with testing the hazard 
Human Genome Sciences, Inc. Confidential Page 45 
Protocol HGS1012-C1103 Amendment 02  Mapatumumab 
 
 ratio for time to progression at a 1-sided sign ificance level of 0.10 with a Cox proportional 
hazards model controlling for the factors stratifying the randomization as covariates. 
9.3.3 Secondary Efficacy Endpoints 
Secondary endpoints include progression-free su rvival, overall response, disease control, 
overall survival, time to response, and duration of response (for responde rs) as defined below: 
• OS: time from randomization to death from any cause. 
• PFS: time from randomization to disease progression or death from any cause. 
• Objective response (CR+PR according to mRECIST for HCC). 
• Disease control (CR+PR+SD according to mRECIST for HCC). 
• Time to response: time from randomization to 1st PR or CR in responders only. 
• Duration of response: time from 1st PR or CR to disease progression; in responders only. 
 
All secondary endpoints will be based on blinded independent review of imaging scans. 
9.3.4 Secondary Efficacy Analyses 
Secondary analyses include estimates, using Kaplan Meier methods, of median PFS and 
median OS along with associated  logrank testing. In addition,  estimates of overall response 
rate (CR+PR) and disease control rate (CR+PR +SD) will be reported with 95% confidence 
intervals and an estimate of the difference in response rates and diseas e control rates between 
groups will be reported and tested for significance with a Pearson chi-square test (or Fisher’s 
exact test).  
9.4 Safety 
9.4.1 Definition of Safety Variables  The safety parameters assessed are given by the following: 
• Frequency, and severity of adverse events (AEs): 
- All AEs will be classified by System Or gan Class and Preferred Term under the 
Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) system of classification with 
a severity assigned accordi ng to the NCI-CTCAE (Version 4.0, 29 May 2009), or the 
rules specified in Section 8.6. 
- Laboratory parameters as presented in Appendix 7 . 
- Laboratory toxicities will be graded based on the NCI-CTCAE (Version 4.0, 29 May 2009). 
• Anti-mapatumumab antibody response.  
• Vital signs. 
• For frequency and severity of adverse events  and laboratory toxicity  grading, counts and 
rates will be presented.

 9.4.2 Human Genome Sciences Safety Review Committee 
The Human Genome Sciences Re view Committeee (HGSRC) is co mprised of the Department 
Heads of Biostatistics, Regulatory Affairs and Drug Development. The HGSRC will review 
safety data after: (1) 10 subjects have comple ted 1 cycle; and (2) 30 subjects have completed 
1 cycle. HGSRC reviews of safety data will  be conducted approximately every 4 months 
thereafter, until 90% of subjects have reached radiologic progression. The HGSRC may 
conduct additional reviews at thei r own request and/or at the re quest of the Medical Monitor. 
The HGSRC may request the un blinding of treatment assignment for a subject and/or 
treatment groups. If treatment assignments are unblinded, the rationale for the unblinding will 
be documented. 
9.4.3 Analysis of Safety Variables 
The safety analysis will consist of a presentati on of rates of AEs observed. Specific AEs will 
be counted once for each subject for calculating rate s, but will be presented in total in subject 
listings. In addition, if the same AE occurs multiple times within a particular subject, the 
highest severity and level of causality observed will be reported. If any associations of interest 
between AEs and baseline characteristics are ob served, additional stratified results may be 
presented. All treatment-emergent AEs will be summarized overall, as well as categorized by 
the MedDRA system of classification. AEs will be presented overall, by severity, by relation 
to mapatumumab/placebo, and by relation to sorafenib. 
9.5 Pharmacokinetics 
9.5.1 Definition of Pharmacokinetic Evaluation Serum mapatumumab concentration data obtained from this study will be pooled with data 
obtained from other studies fo r use in a population PK analys is, which will be reported 
separately. 
9.5.2 Analysis of Pharmacokinetics 
The serum mapatumumab concentration will be determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent 
assay. Serum mapatumumab concentration resu lts for this study will be presented using 
appropriate graphic and tabular summaries. 
9.6 Pharmacodynamics 
Expression of biomarkers in tumor tissue and pe ripheral blood will be correlated with clinical 
outcomes and may be reported separately  from the clinical study report.  
10 Study Administration 
10.1 Informed Consent 
A copy of the proposed informed consent document(s) must be submitted to the sponsor or designee for review and comment prior to submission to the reviewing IRB/IEC. The consent 
form must be approved by the IRB/IEC and contain all elements required by national, state, local, and institutional regulations or requirements. 
Human Genome Sciences, Inc. Confidential Page 47 
Protocol HGS1012-C1103 Amendment 02  Mapatumumab 
 
 It is the responsibility of the investigator to pr ovide each subject with full and adequate verbal 
and written information using the IRB/IEC approved informed consent document(s), 
including the objective and pro cedures of the study and the possible risks involved before 
inclusion in the study. Each subject must vo luntarily provide written informed consent 
(including consent for the use and disclosure of  research-related health information). The 
consent must be obtained prior to  performing any study-related proc edures that are not part of 
normal patient care, including sc reening and changes in medications including any washout of 
medications. A copy of the signed informed c onsent must be given to the study subject. 
10.2 Institutional Review Board Re view/Independent Ethics Committee 
Review  and Approval 
The investigator or sponsor (a s appropriate per national regula tions) shall assure that an 
IRB/IEC, constituted in accordance with ICH Good Clinical Practices, will provide initial and 
continuing review of the study. 
Prior to shipment of the study agent and enrollment of study subjects, documented IRB/IEC 
approval of the protocol, informed consen t form, and any advertisement for subject 
recruitment must be obtained and prov ided to the sponsor or designee. 
The IRB/IEC must also be informed of all prot ocol amendments prior to implementation. The 
investigator must provide reports of any cha nge in research activity (ie, the completion, 
termination, or discontinuation of a study) to the IRB/IEC. 
10.3 Protocol Compliance 
Except for a change that is intended to elimin ate an apparent immediate hazard to a study 
subject, the protocol shall be conducted as described. Any such change must be reported 
immediately to the sponsor and to the IRB/IEC. 
10.4 Protocol Revisions 
Protocol amendments will be prepared and appr oved by the sponsor. All protocol amendments 
will be signed by the investigator and submitted to the IRB/IEC for review prior to 
implementation. Documentation of IRB/IEC approval must be forwarded to the sponsor or designee. If an amendment signif icantly alters the st udy design, increases potential risk to the 
subject or otherwise affects statements in th e informed consent form, the informed consent 
form must be revised accordingly and submitted to the IRB/IEC for review and approval. The approved consent form must be us ed to obtain informed consen t from new subjects prior to 
enrollment and must be used to obtain informed consent from subjects already enrolled if they are affected by the amendment. 
10.5 Data Collection and Management 
Data collected for each study subject are re corded electronically on case report forms 
provided or approved by the sponsor.  
Human Genome Sciences, Inc. Confidential Page 48 
Protocol HGS1012-C1103 Amendment 02  Mapatumumab 
 
 The investigator is responsible for maintaining accurate, complete, and up-to-date records for 
each subject. The investigator is also responsible for maintaining any source documents related to the study, incl uding any films, tracings, computer discs, or tapes. The investigator 
must promptly review the completed case report forms for each subject. As the person ultimately responsible for the accu racy of all data, the investigat or must sign the Investigator's 
Statement in each subject's case report form. 
The anonymity of participating subjects must be maintained. Subjects are identified by an 
assigned subject number on case report forms and other documents submitted to the sponsor. 
Documents that identify the subject beyond subj ect number are not submitted to the sponsor 
(ie, the signed informed consent document) and must be maintained in strict confidence by the 
investigator, except to the extent necessary to  allow auditing by the regulatory authorities, 
study monitor, or sponsor representatives. 
Sites enter subject data directly into the el ectronic data capture (EDC) system and the EDC 
system automatically generates queries result ing from computer checks embedded into the 
system, so as to ensure accuracy, quality, consistency, and completeness of the database. 
Manual queries resulting from review by m onitors, medical coders, and other Data 
Management staff are also generated from w ithin the EDC system, where they are tracked. 
Sites resolve the queries and correct the entered data when necessary. Every change to data is 
captured in the EDC system audit trail. At study end, each site is provided with a compact disk containing the electronic case re port forms for each of their subjects. 
Upon completion of the study, or after reaching a pre-specified point in the study, Data Management locks the database and generates the SAS datasets necessary for data analysis 
and reporting. 
10.6 Study Monitoring 
The study sponsor, Human Genome Sciences, Inc., or designee, will monitor the study. Study 
monitors representing the sponsor will visit study sites routinely throughout the trial. The 
sponsor will review the paper subject diarie s and electronic case report forms and compare 
them with source documents to verify accurate and complete collection of data and confirm that the study is being conducted according to the protocol. Auditors representing the sponsor 
may also similarly evaluate the study and its monitors. For these purpos es, the investigator 
will make paper subject diaries and electronic case report forms and source documents available when requested. 
In addition, the study may be evaluated by  representatives of the national regulatory 
authorities, who will also be allowed access to study documents. The investigators will 
promptly notify Human Genome Sciences of any audits they have scheduled with any 
regulatory authority. 
10.7 Drug Accountability 
Upon receipt, the designated unblinded pharmacy personnel at the study site are responsible 
for taking an inventory of the study agent, incl uding any buffers or dilu ents. A record of this 
Human Genome Sciences, Inc. Confidential Page 49 
Protocol HGS1012-C1103 Amendment 02  Mapatumumab 
 
 inventory must be kept and usage must be documented on study agent inventory forms 
provided by the sponsor. 
Study agent inventory forms will be examined  and reconciled by an unblinded Clinical 
Research Associate, or designee. At the end of the study, all used and unused study agent 
must be accounted for on a study agent accountability form provided to the investigator by 
Human Genome Sciences or its designee. 
10.8 Retention of Records 
The investigator shall retain  all records and source documents pertaining to the study, 
including any films, tracings, computer discs, or tapes. They will be retained for the longer of 
the maximum period required by the country and institution in which the study is conducted, 
or the period specified by the sponsor at the time the study is completed, terminated, or 
discontinued. 
If the investigator leaves the institution, the records shall be transfer red to an appropriate 
designee who accepts the responsibility for record retention. Notice of such transfer shall be 
documented in writing and provided to the sponsor. 
10.9 Financial Disclosure 
The investigator will provide Human Genome Sc iences sufficient and accurate information on 
financial interests (proprietary or equity interests,  payments exclusive of c linical trial costs) to 
allow complete disclosure to regulatory auth orities. The investigator shall promptly update 
this information if any relevant changes occur during the course of the investigation and for a 
period of 1 year following study completion. 
10.10 Publication Policy 
This study is being conducted as part of a multi -center clinical study. Data from all sites 
participating in the multi-center clinical study will be pooled and analyzed. The investigator 
acknowledges that an independent, joint publica tion is anticipated to be authored by the 
investigators of the multi-center study and spons or’s representatives. Neither institution nor 
principal investigator shall inde pendently publish or present the results of the study prior to 
the publication of the mu lti-center study publication. The inves tigator agrees th at the sponsor 
will be the coordinator and arb itrator of all multi-center stud y publications. For multi-center 
trials, no investigator will be authorized to publish study results from an individual center 
until the earlier of the multi-center  trial results are published or 12 months after the end or 
termination of the multi-center trial at all sites. 
The investigator shall submit a copy of any proposed publication, manuscript, abstract, 
presentation or other document with respect to this study to the sponsor for review and 
comment at least 60 days prior to its subm ission for publication or presentation. No 
publication or presentation with respect to th e study shall be made unless and until the entire 
sponsor’s comments on the proposed publication or presentation have been considered and 
any information determined by sponsor to be confidential information has been removed. 
Human Genome Sciences, Inc. Confidential Page 50 
Protocol HGS1012-C1103 Amendment 02  Mapatumumab 
 
 If requested in writing by the sponsor, the investigator shall withhold material from 
submission for publication or presen tation for an additional 60 days  to allow for the filing of a 
patent application or the taking of other meas ures to establish and preserve the sponsor’s 
proprietary rights. 
10.11 Study or Study Site Termination 
If Human Genome Sciences, the investigator, IRB/IEC, or a regulatory authority discovers 
conditions arising during the study  that indicate that the study should be halted or that the 
study center should be terminated, this action may be taken after appropriate consultation 
between Human Genome Sciences and the investigator. Conditions that may warrant termination of the study include, but are not limited to, the following: 
• The discovery of an unexpected, serious, or unac ceptable risk to the subjects enrolled in 
the study. 
• A decision on the part of Human Genome Sciences to suspend or discontinue testing, 
evaluation, or development of the product. 
 
The study site may warrant termination under the following conditions: 
• Failure of the investigator to enroll su bjects into the study at an acceptable rate. 
• Failure of the investigator to comply with pertinent regulatory authority regulations. 
• Submission of knowingly false information from  the research facility to Human Genome 
Sciences, study monitor, or  the regulatory authority. 
• Insufficient adherence to protocol requirements.

 Appendix 5 Modified Re sponse Evaluation Criter ia in Hepatocellular 
Carcinoma (mRE CIST for HCC) 
(Adapted from  Lencioni and Llove t, 2010 for use in this study) 
Measurable disease:  The presence of at least 1 target lesion, by contrast enhanced 
computerized tomography (CT) with use of mu ltislice scanners, or cont rast enhanced dynamic 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). 
Target lesion: Meets all the following criteria: 
- Located in the liver. 
- Can be accurately measured in at least 1 dimension. 
- Well-delineated area of viable, hypervascular (contrast enhancem ent in the arterial phase) 
tumor that is > 2 cm in the axial plane. 
- Suitable for repeat measurement. 
- Not previously treated with locoregional or systemic treatment unless the lesion shows a 
well-delineated area of viable (c ontrast enhancement in the arterial phase) tumor that is 
> 2 cm in the axial plane. (If the lesion is poorly demarcated or exhibits atypical enhancement as a result of the previous interven tion, then it cannot be selected as a target 
lesion). 
 A maximum of 5 target lesions may be selected. 
Nontarget lesion: Other lesions, including small lesions ( ≤ 2 cm in the axial plane). Note that 
malignant portal vein thrombosis should be considered a nonmeasurable, and therefore 
nontarget, lesion. Lymph nodes at the portal hepa tic can be considered as malignant if the 
lymph node short axis is at leas t 2 cm. Selection of effusion, in cluding ascities, as a nontarget 
lesion is prohibited. Similarly, bone lesions or any ot her lesion outside the CT or MRI of the 
abdomen or obtained by other modality, ma y not be selected as nontarget lesions.  
Measurement of lesions:  Imaging studies will be by contrast enhanced CT, with use of 
multislice scanners, or contrast enhanced MRI. The same method mu st be used at baseline and 
during follow up. Note that the longest diameter of the viable tumor is not necessarily located in the same scan plane in which the baseline diameter was measured. The measurement of the 
viable tumor diameter should not include any major intervening areas of necrosis. (Please see the HGS1012-C1103 Radiographic Data Collection Manual). 
Evaluation of target lesions: 
Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of intratumoral arterial enhancement in all target 
lesions. 
Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of viable 
(enhancement in the arterial phase) target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of the diameters of target lesions. AM01 
21Dec10 
Human Genome Sciences, Inc. Confidential Page 64 
Protocol HGS1012-C1103 Amendment 02  Mapatumumab 
 
 Stable Disease (SD): Any cases that  do not qualify for CR, PR or PD. 
Progressive Disease (PD): An incr ease of at least 20% in the su m of the diameters of viable 
(enhancing) target lesions, taking as referen ce the smallest sum of the diameters of viable 
(enhancing) target lesions reco rded since treatment started. 
Evaluation of nontarget lesions:  
Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of intratumoral arterial enhancement. 
Incomplete Response/Stable Disease (IR/SD):  Persistence of intratumoral arterial 
enhancement in 1 or more nontarget lesions. Progressive Disease (PD): Unequivocal prog ression of existing nontarget lesions.   
Evaluation of new lesions: A newly detected hepatic nodule will be classified as evidence of 
progression when its longest diameter is ≥ 1 cm and the nodule shows the 
hypervascularization in the arteri al phase with washout in the portal venous or late venous 
phase.   Liver lesions ≥ 1 cm that do not show a typical vascul ar pattern can be diagnosed as HCC by 
evidence of at least a 1 cm-interval growth in subsequent scans.  An individual radiologic event will be adjudicated in retrospect as progression at the time it 
was 1st detected  by imaging techniques, even if strict criteria were fulfilled only on subsequent 
radiologic testing. Images by another modality may be obtained, as clinically indicated post-baseline. Sites may 
conclude that post-baseline images based on a nother modality that indicate disease are 
evidence of radiologic progression if: (1) there was no imaging done at baseline; (2) if there 
was imaging done at baseline showing no disease present at that time; or (3) if there was 
imagine done at baseline indicating that the on-treatment assessment represents unequivocal 
worsening. In these cases the disease will be reported as ‘new lesions’. 
All images obtained on study will be provided the BICR for the independent efficacy read, or 
for confirmation of progression if required or requested. 
Evaluation of Overall Response: The overall response is determined at each assessment and

 Appendix 6 Exploratory Biomarker Sub-study 
1. Background 
Mapatumumab is a targeted therapy. Presently , the relationship between  expression of the 
target, TRAIL-R1, and the anti-tumor activity of the antibody is incompletely understood. 
Studies conducted with cell li nes derived from human tumors  have suggested that the 
relationship between receptor expression and mapatumumab-induced tumor cell death may be 
complex. However, studies of human tumor cells  in vitro and transplanted into animals may 
not accurately reflect the relationship between receptor expression and response to 
mapatumumab that may be observed in patients with cancer. One feature of this biomarker 
study is to compare TRAIL-R1 e xpression from available biopsy material. This could allow 
for a greater understanding of patterns of TRAIL-R1 expression in advanced hepatocellular 
carcinoma. 
It is also likely that other factors involved in TRAIL-R1 si gnaling could critically affect 
response to mapatumumab treatment. A 2nd goal of this biomarke r study is to evaluate 
biomarkers that may be potential indicators or  modifiers of response to mapatumumab. To 
identify factors that may indicate that a pa tient is responding to treatment, serum-based 
markers will be compared before and after treatment. To explore factors that are associated 
with the outcome of therapy and could be used prior to treatment to predict which patients will respond, somatic (inherited) differences th at modify a patient’s drug response will be 
examined. 
The information generated from this sub-study will be used solely for research purposes to 
improve future treatment with mapatumumab. It will not be used to change diagnoses or alter therapy. Participation in this sub-study is optional. 
2. Study Objectives and Design 
2.1. Indicators of Response 2.1.1. Serum-Based Markers of Response 
Induction of cell death in tumor cells can elicit the release of  certain biomarkers into the 
serum. These markers can be quantified to eval uate treatment effect. To assess release of 
biomarkers associated with cell death, serum- based assays will be conducted, including, but 
not limited to, assessments of M30, a fragment  of cytokeratin 18 that is generated by 
induction of programmed cell death in epithelial tissues. Other examples of markers of tumor 
cell death that will be examined include the cytokines TRAIL, TNF α, soluble Fas ligand, 
interferon α, interferon γ, interleukin-2, interleukin-6, in terleukin-8, interleukin-10, and 
interleukin-12. The levels of these factors will be  examined before and after treatment to see if 
they correlate with response to treatment. 
Serum will be isolated and the level of cytokines and other markers like M30 will be 
characterized. Collection, processing and ha ndling of these samples are described in the 
laboratory manual. 
Human Genome Sciences, Inc. Confidential Page 67 
Protocol HGS1012-C1103 Amendment 02  Mapatumumab 
 
 Samples collected in this study will be stored for up to 15 years and may be analyzed with 
samples collected in other studies, but will only  be used for mapatumumab-related research. 
2.2. Modifiers of Response 
2.2.1. Neoplastic Modifiers of Response 
Historically collected tumor biops y material, if available, will  be collected from subjects 
during Cycle 1. Samples will also be obtaine d from subjects who undergo a biopsy during the 
treatment period. Samples of resected tumor ti ssue that has been formalin-fixed and embedded 
in paraffin is acceptable; either tissue blocks or  slides may be provided. Frozen samples of 
tumor tissue may also be provided. Biopsy materi al collected from fine needle aspirates may 
be provided; either cell pellets or cytological slides are acceptable. 
Levels of TRAIL receptors will be assessed in biopsy material using immunohistochemical 
techniques if samples are available as form alin-fixed/paraffin-embedded tissue blocks or 
slides. Historically obtained biopsy material or biopsy material obtai ned during the treatment 
period that is in the form of fresh frozen tissue or cell pellet samples will be utilized to isolate 
RNA for analysis of TRAIL receptor gene expression. Similar techniques will be used to evaluate other potential biomarkers and factors that may 
influence mapatumumab response. These may in clude but are not limited to caspase 8, AKT 
and Mcl-1. 
See the laboratory manual for collection, processing and handling of these samples. 
Samples collected in this study will be stored for up to 15 years and may be analyzed with 
samples collected in other studies, but will only  be used for mapatumumab-related research. 
2.2.2. Somatic Modifiers of Response 
Inherited differences in the genes that code  for drug targets or components of signaling 
pathways related to the target can dramatically influence the effect of pharmacotherapy. 
Variations in genes that could potentially  impact mapatumumab’s activity, including 
polymorphic changes in the Fc gamma receptor and interleukin-6 promoter and K-Ras gene mutations, will be examined to see if they correlate with response to treatment. 
DNA will be isolated from the blood and polymorphisms and mutations in specific 
response-related genes will be characterized. Collection, pro cessing and handling of these 
samples are described in the laboratory manual. Samples collected in this study will be stored for up to 15 years and may be analyzed with 
samples collected in other studies, but will only  be used for mapatumumab-related research.

 3. Statistical Analysis 
Associations will be assessed between candidate biomarkers and treatment outcomes captured 
in the clinical database. Statistical tests to  be performed may include Pearson chi-square 
testing, Fisher’s exact test, ANOVA and ANCO VA. Results of the biomarker sub-study may 
be reported independent of the results of HGS1012-C1103. 
4. Subject Selection and Withdrawal 
Subjects enrolled in the HGS1012-C1103 research study are given the option to participate in 
the Biomarkers Sub-study. A subject may withdraw from the sub-study at any time by contacting their Study Investigator, who will co ntact the sponsor. The sponsor will destroy 
any remaining sample materials an d will send a letter back to  the Investigator confirming 
sample destruction. Any data or  analysis generated from the sa mple prior to the request for 
destruction will not be destroyed. However, no new information will be generated from the 
sample and no new analysis will be performed. 
5. Confidentiality 
Information about sub-study subjects will be kept confidential and managed according to the 
requirements of local privacy regulations. Information obtained from samples will not be 
returned to subjects and will not be pl aced in the subject’s medical record. 
6. Ethical Considerations 
All subjects enrolled in the HGS1012-C1103 resear ch study who agree to participate in the 
Biomarker Sub-study will be asked to sign a se parate Biomarker Informed Consent. Choosing 
to not participate in this sub-study will not affect  the subject’s ability to participate in the main 
clinical trial. The Biomarker Informed C onsent will be submitted along with the main 
research study informed consent for review by the Institutional Review Board/Ethical 
Committee. 
7. Publication of Biomarker Results 
Any significant findings, based upon the analysis of aggregate data collected from this 
sub-study may be published by Human Genome Sc iences. Personal identifiers will not be 
used in any publication resu lting from this sub-study.

 Appendix 8 Treatment of Allerg ic/Hypersensitivity Reactions 
In the event of allergic/hypersensitivity reacti ons to mapatumumab/placeb o, investigators will 
institute treatment measures according to best  medical and nursing practice. The grading is 
based upon the NCI-CTCAE Version 4.0.0. 
The following treatment guidelines will be employed: 
• If chills and fever occur, the infusion w ill be interrupted. Subjects may be treated 
symptomatically and the infusion will be restarted at 50% of the original rate. 
 
Grade 1 allergic/hyper sensitivity reaction  (transient flushing or rash, drug fever < 38°C): 
• Decrease infusion rate by 50% and monitor for worsening condition. If the reaction 
worsens, stop the infusion. 
 Grade 2 allergic/hypersensitivity reaction  (rash, flushing, urticaria, dyspnea, drug fever 
< 38°C): 
• Stop the infusion. 
• Administer bronchodilators, oxygen, acetam inophen, etc as medically indicated. 
• Resume infusion at 50% of previous rate once reaction has decreased to ≤ Grade 1 in 
severity. Monitor closely for any worsening.  If the reaction recu rs, stop the infusion. 
 Re-treatment following Grade 1 or Grad e 2 allergic/hypersensitivity reactions: 
• Once the infusion rate has been decreased due to  an allergic/hypersensi tivity reaction, it 
will remain decreased for all subsequent infusions.  
• If the subject has a 2nd reaction at the lower infusion ra te, the infusion will be stopped and 
the subject will receive no further tr eatment with mapatumumab/placebo. 
• If the subject experiences a Grade 3 or Grad e 4 allergic/hypersensiti vity reaction at any 
time, the subject will receive no furthe r treatment with mapatumumab/placebo. 
• If there are questions concerning wh ether an observed reaction is an 
allergic/hypersensitivity of Grades 1-4, the medical monitor will be contacted immediately to assist with grading the reaction.  
 Grade 3 or Grade 4 allergic /hypersensitivity reaction: 
• A Grade 3 hypersensitivity reaction consis ts of symptomatic bronchospasm requiring 
parenteral medications with or without urticaria, allergy-related edema/angioedema, or 
asymptomatic hypotension not requiring treatment. 
• A Grade 4 hypersensitivity reaction (ie, anaphylaxis) is a life-threatening event 
characterized by the same symptoms as in a Grade 3 reaction but also complicated by 
symptomatic hypotension or oxygen saturation of 90% or less. 
 
Human Genome Sciences, Inc. Confidential Page 71 
Protocol HGS1012-C1103 Amendment 02  Mapatumumab 
 
 Treatment of Grade 3 or Grade 4 allergic/hypersensitivity reaction: 
• Stop the infusion immediately and disconnect infusion tubing from the subject. 
• Administer epinephrine, bronc hodilators, antihistamines, glucocorticoids, intravenous 
fluids, vasopressor agents, oxygen, etc, as medically indicated.

Human Genome Sciences, Inc. Confidential Page 6 
Protocol HGS1012-C1103 Amendment 01  Mapatumumab 
 
Study Treatment: 
Mapatumumab will be supplied in open labe l vials and third party unblinding will be 
employed. The study agent will be reconstituted by the unblinded site pharmacist or unblinded 
designee. The unblinded site pharmacist or un blinded designee will also be the person 
responsible for receiving and dispensing study  agent but independent of all other study 
activities. All other study personnel, the subject, the Sponsor will remain blinded to the study 
agent received. Separate monitors will be responsible for the clinical (blinded monitor) and study agent (unblinded monito r) aspects of the study. 
Subjects will receive treatment every 21 days (ie, a cycle) as outlined below: 
Arm A:  Sorafenib 400 mg orally twice da ily continuously in each cycle + placebo 
intravenously on Day 1 of each cycle. 
Arm B: Sorafenib 400 mg orally twice daily  continuously + mapatumumab (30 mg/kg) 
intravenously on Day 1 of each cycle. 
Subjects will continue to receive study treatment (s) until radiologic di sease progression or 
unacceptable toxicity. Subjects unable to tole rate sorafenib may continue to receive 
mapatumumab/placebo every 21 days until ra diographic progression. Subjects unable to 
tolerate mapatumumab/placebo may continue to receive sorafenib until radiographic 
progression. All subjects will have an end of treatment visit at least 30 days after the last dose of sorafenib and/or mapatumumab/placebo whichever is later. Af ter discontinuation of 
treatment, subjects will continue to be fo llowed for radiologic disease assessments every 
6 weeks, starting 6 weeks after the previous disease assessment while on treatment, until 
documented radiologic disease progression (if not previously documented) and then every 
3 months thereafter for survival until at least 90% of the subjects have met the survival endpoint. 
Disease Assessments: Radiologic disease assessments along with assessm ent of alpha fetoprotein will be performed 
at the end of every two 21-day cycles (ie, Cycles  2, 4, 6 and every 2 cycles thereafter). The 
disease assessment will be performed and documented no earlier than 5 days before the start 
of the next cycle. Clinical responses will be evaluated according to mRECIST for HCC (see 
Section 6.7 and Appendix 5). The same assessment method will be used throughout the study 
for each subject. If disease progression is base d only on new lesions or is equivocal, images 
will be provided to the blinded, independent, central reader (BICR) for confirmation of disease progression. Partial response (PR) and complete response (CR) will be confirmed at 
the next scheduled disease assessment (no fewer than 4 weeks after the initial documentation of PR or CR). All imaging scans used for disease assessments will be made available for independent radiology review by the Sponsor or designee. 
Human Genome Sciences, Inc. Confidential Page 7 
Protocol HGS1012-C1103 Amendment 01  Mapatumumab 
 
Safety Assessments: 
The safety of sorafenib and mapatumumab wi ll be assessed by evaluation of the type, 
frequency, and severity of adverse events (ie, according to the NCI-CTCAE Version 4.0 
grading) and changes in clinic al laboratory tests (hematology and clinical chemistry) and 
immunogenicity over time. In the event that an  adverse event does not have an NCI-CTCAE 
Version 4.0 grading, the se verity grades in Section 8.6 will be used. Adverse events (including 
serious adverse events) will be captured from the start of study agent administration (sorafenib 
and/or mapatumumab/placebo) through at least 30 days following the last dose of sorafenib 
and/or mapatumumab/placebo, whichever is late r. Laboratory assessments will be performed 
at screening, and during each study visit outl ined in the study calendar found in Section 6.3. 
The Human Genome Sciences Re view Committeee (HGSRC) is co mprised of the Department 
Heads of Biostatistics, Regulatory Affairs and Drug Development. The HGSRC will review safety data after: (1) 10 subjects have comple ted 1 cycle; and (2) 30 subjects have completed 
1 cycle. HGSRC reviews of safety data will  be conducted approximately every 4 months 
thereafter, until 90% of subjects have reached radiologic progression. The HGSRC may 
conduct additional reviews at thei r own request and/or at the re quest of the Medical Monitor. 
The HGSRC may request the un blinding of treatment assignment for a subject and/or 
treatment groups. If treatment assignments are unblinded, the rationale for the unblinding will 
be documented. 
Immunogenicity: Blood samples for serum antibodies to mapatumumab will be obtained as outlined in  
Table 6-1 . 
Dose Modification/Delay: 
Dose modifications will not be allowed for mapatumumab/placebo. Dose modifications of 
sorafenib for toxicity will be made according to the guidelines provided in the treatment 
section (Section 5.2.3) of the protocol. 
Details regarding pre-treatment and manageme nt of hypersensitivity reactions related to 
mapatumumab are provided in Section 5.1.5 and Appendix 8. 
Pharmacokinetics: 
Multiple blood specimens will be obtained from subjects for serum mapatumumab 
concentration determinations as outlined in Table 6-1 . 
Pharmacodynamics: 
Subjects will be given the optio n to participate in a biomarke r research sub-study. Consenting 
subjects will be asked to provide a historic ally obtained biopsy samp le, if available, and 
several blood samples. In addition, samples will be requested from subjects who undergo a 
biopsy during the treatment period.

Protocol HGS1012-C1103 Amendment 01  Mapatumumab 
 
To examine biomarkers present peripherally, blood will be drawn during Cycles 1 and 2, from 
which DNA and serum proteins will be isolat ed. The biomarker sub-study is detailed in 
Appendix 6. 
Exploratory Assessments: Blood samples will be collected for quantification of B and T lymphocyte subsets on Day 1 
(prior to dosing) and Day 15 of Cycles 1 and 2. 
Study Endpoints: The following will be evaluated (these endpoints and the respective analyses are defined in 
Section 9): 
Primary: 
• Time to progression (TTP). 
 Secondary: 
• Overall survival. 
• Progression-free survival. 
• Objective response (complete response  [CR] + partial response [PR]). 
• Disease control (CR + PR + stable disease [SD]). 
• Response duration and time to response in responders. 
• Frequency and severity of treat ment-emergent adverse events. 
• Laboratory parameters. 
• Serum mapatumumab concentrations for use in a population pharmacokinetic analysis. 
 Statistical Methods: 
Sample Size: A total of approximately 100 subjects will be randomly assigned to 1 of 2 arms and treated 
with either sorafenib + placebo or the 2-agent combination of sorafenib and mapatumumab at 30 mg/kg in a 1:1 ratio. A sample size of 50 subjects randomized and treated in each group is sufficient to estimate the median time to progre ssion with a precision of approximately -1.9 M 
to +2.6 M relative to the observed median. In  addition, a sample size of 50 patients per arm 
will provide 80% power to detect an improveme nt in TTP from 5.5 to 8.9 M with at a 
one-sided significance level of 0.10. 
Statistical Analysis: The primary analysis will be an estimate of median time to progressi on in each arm using 
Kaplan Meier methods, reported with 95% c onfidence intervals, al ong with testing the 
hazard ratio for time to progression at a 1-sided significance level of 0.10 with a Cox

proportional hazards model controlling for the factors stratifying the randomization as 
covariates. Secondary analyses  include estimates, using Kaplan Meier methods, of median 
progression-free survival (PFS) and median overall survival (OS) along with associated logrank testing. In addition, estimates of ove rall response rate (CR+PR) and disease control 
rate (CR+PR+SD) will be reported with 95% confidence intervals a nd an estimate of the 
difference in response rates and disease contro l rates between groups will be reported and 
tested for significance with a Pearson chi-square test (or Fisher’s exact test). For frequency 
and severity of adverse events and laborator y toxicity grading, counts and rates will be 
presented.

1 Background 
1.1 Hepatocellular Carcinoma 
Hepatocellular carcinoma is the 5th most common cancer worldwide accounting for 2% of all 
malignancies. It is the 3rd leading cause of cancer-related death globally with 1 million new 
cases a year (WHO, 2007; IACR, 2002; Fe rlay et al, 2004; Lopez et al, 2006). 
Hepatocellular carcinoma is more prevalent in ma les with a male:female ratio as high as 8:1. 
Depending on the endemic risk factors, hepato cellular carcinoma is diagnosed during the 
4th through 6th decades of life. The reported incide nce of  hepatocellular carcinoma is 
increasing because of a better ability to diagnose the diseas e and because of the long-term 
consequences of hepatitis C virus (HCV) and he patitis B virus (HBV) infection (Reis et al, 
2006). Worldwide the most common cause of hepatocellular carcinoma is chronic HBV 
infection (El-Serag et al, 2003). Endemic ar eas thus include China, South Asia and 
South Africa where the incidence of hepatocellu lar carcinoma can be as high as 120 cases 
per 100,000. In the United States, where HCV and alcohol are the main risk factors, 
the age-adjusted incidence rates have incr eased from 1.4 cases per 100,000 in 1980 to a 
current incidence of 4 cases per 100,000. Th is equates to about 8500-11,000 new cases 
diagnosed each year (IACR, 2002; Ferlay et al, 2004; Pawlik et al, 2004 ; Edwards, et al, 2005; 
Jemal et al, 2007; Bosch et al, 2004). 
1.2 Treatment Options for Patient s with Hepatocellular Carcinoma 
Surgery, including transplantation, is the only curative modality for hepatocellular carcinoma 
(Venook, 1994; Cha et al, 2003). The 5-year surv ival rate for patients with unresectable 
hepatocellular carcinoma is 11% in the US (ACS, 2007), < 8% in Europe (Capocaccia et al, 
2007), and < 10% in Asia (Teo and Fock, 2001). Symptomatic hepatocellular carcinoma has a 
very poor prognosis with a median survival of  1–8 months (Former et al, 2006; Llovet et al, 
1999a, b). 
Sorafenib, a multikinase inhibitor, is the 1st systemic therapy to significantly impact survival 
in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma, as demonstrated in an international, 
multicenter Phase 3, placebo-controlled trial (L lovet et al, 2007). Sora fenib was approved in 
the United States and European Union for the 1st-line treatment of advanced hepatocellular 
carcinoma in late 2007 and th e 2008 National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines 
have been updated with the addition of sorafe nib as a treatment option for hepatocellular 
carcinoma patients. The updated Barcelona C linic Liver Cancer (BCLC) guidelines 
recommend sorafenib for hepatocellular carcinoma patients with BCLC Advanced Stage (C) (Forner et al, 2010). 
1.3 The Role of the TRAIL Pathway in HCC 
1.3.1 TRAIL and TRAIL Receptors 
TRAIL is a member of the tumor necrosis f actor (TNF) ligand superf amily, with homology 
to Fas/Apo1 ligand (Pitti et al, 1996; W iley et al, 1995). TRAIL induces programmed 
cell death primarily in tumor cells through activation of TRAIL death receptors, TRAIL-R1 
(death receptor 4) or TRAIL-R2 (death receptor 5) (Ashkenazi et al, 1999; Evdokiou et al, 
Human Genome Sciences, Inc. Confidential Page 17 
Protocol HGS1012-C1103 Amendment 01  Mapatumumab 
 
2002; Kothny-Wilkes et al, 1998; Lawrence et al , 2001; Pitti et al, 1996; Walczak et al, 1999; 
Wiley et al, 1995). 
TRAIL-R1, the target of mapatumumab, is detect able on tumor cells derived from colon, lung, 
liver, gastric, pancreas, uterus and esophagus and in tissue sections from various tumors of the 
colon, lung, pancreas, liver and stomach without significant expression in parallel normal 
tissues (Halpern et al, 2004; Roach et al, 2004). 
1.3.2 TRAIL and HBV/HCV Infection 
Acutely infected tissues, including the liver, ut ilize the TRAIL pathway to eliminate virally 
and bacterially infected cells (Herr et al, 20 07). In viral hepatitis, TRAIL and 1 of its 
receptors, TRAIL-R2, are upregulated and cont ribute to the elimination of infected 
hepatocytes associated with viral hepatitis (B antel and Schulze-Osthoff, 2003; Lin et al, 2002; 
Matsuda et al, 2005). In addition to HBV and HCV infection, steat osis, exposure to bile acids 
and chronic alcohol exposure induce increase d expression of TRAIL and TRAIL-R2, but not 
TRAIL-R1, in human hepatocytes (Dunn et al, 2007; Mundt et al, 2005). Cell surface 
expression of TRAIL-R2, but not TRAIL-R1, was altered and responsible for sensitization to 
TRAIL in hepatocytes exposed to  bile acids (Higuchi et al, 2001; Malhi et al, 2007). These 
findings have been reproduced in preclinical models. Non-virally infected hepatocytes are 
refractory to TRAIL and TRAIL- R agonists but exposure of HC V-infected hepatocytes to 
TRAIL leads to a significant level of apoptosis  (Volkmann  et al, 2007). Inhibition of the 
TRAIL pathway may protect infected cells from  apoptosis and allow for chronic infection 
(Mundt et al, 2003). Recent non-clinical observations  demonstrated that natural killer cells 
expressing the ligand TRAIL, are enriched in the livers of patients with chronic HBV 
infection, and TRAIL is overexpr essed in the livers of patients with HCV-associated steatosis 
(Mundt et al, 2005).  
In summary, preclinical data suggest that mapatumumab may promote apoptosis of cancer 
cells, including hepatocellular carcinoma cells. Whether viral infectio n, including HBV or 
HCV infection, will attenuate or  modulate the effects of mapatumumab on hepatocytes is not 
yet known, but experience to date in a Phase 1b trial of mapatumumab in combination with 
sorafenib in subjects with advanced hepatoce llular carcinoma who are positive for hepatitis B 
surface antigen or hepatitis C antibody indicates that the safety experience is consistent with 
underlying disease and known sora fenib toxicities (see Section 1.2). 
1.4 Mapatumumab 
1.4.1 Mapatumumab Pharmacology 
Mapatumumab is a fully human, agonist monoc lonal antibody that activ ates the cell death 
pathway in tumor cells by specifically binding to TRAIL-R1 with high affinity. 
Mapatumumab efficiently induces apoptosis in human cancer cell lines expressing the 
TRAIL-R1 protein on the cell surface. Nonc linical studies have demonstrated that 
mapatumumab can induce cytotoxicity in multiple  tumor cell lines representing both solid and 
hematological malignancies, including cancers of the biliary tract, colon, lung, breast, pancreas, esophagus, ovary, kidney, uterus, as  well as lymphoma and various leukemias. 
Mapatumumab has also demonstrated anti-tum or activity as a single agent, preventing 
Human Genome Sciences, Inc. Confidential Page 18 
Protocol HGS1012-C1103 Amendment 01  Mapatumumab 
 
tumor growth and in some cases causing regressi on of tumors in xenograft tumor models of 
multiple human malignancies, including lung, colon, kidney, and uterus (Camidge, 2007; 
Georgakis et al, 2005; Jin et al, 2007; Humphr eys, 2004; Marini et al, 2006; Menoret et al, 
2006; Pukac et al, 2005). 
The relationship between receptor expression and response to therapy with mapatumumab 
remains unclear. In vitro studies of cell lines have shown that TRAIL-R1 expression level is 
not a consistent predictor of response to ma patumumab. Although both TRAIL-R1 expression 
and apoptosis in response to mapatumumab are increased in many tumor cell lines as 
compared with normal diploid cells, there are ex amples of mapatumumab cytotoxicity on cell 
lines with very low levels of detectable receptor, and conversely, mapatumumab resistant cell lines that have relatively high levels of TRAIL-R1 cell surface expression. 
Tumor cell cytotoxic activity can be enhanced  when mapatumumab is administered in 
combination with chemotherapeutics or other anti-neoplastic agents. Enhanced apoptotic 
signaling, in vitro cell killing and in vivo anti-tumor activity have been observed when mapatumumab has been combined with various types of therapeutic agents and treatments including microtubule poisons, anti metabolites,  topoisomerase inhi bitors, proteosome 
inhibitors, platinum agents and radiation. Both the level and spectrum of activity of 
mapatumumab is enhanced in in vitro cyto toxicity and in vivo xenograft studies in 
combination with various chemotherapeutic and anti-neoplastic agents, including a xenograft model of hepatocellular carcinoma in combination with cisplatin and gemcitabine (Camidge, 2007; Pukac et al, 2005; Georgakis et al, 2005; Humphreys, 2004; Jin et al, 2007; 
Human Genome Sciences data on file). 
Please refer to the mapatumumab Investigator’s  Brochure for detailed information regarding 
the nonclinical pharmacology, toxicology, and PK of mapatumumab. 
1.4.2 Non-Clinical Mapatumumab Safety Studies 
To assess the nonclinical safety of mapatumuma b, a 6-month toxicity study, with a 4-month 
recovery period, was conducted in chimpanzees. Mapatumumab was administered 
intravenously at up to 40 mg/kg every 10 days. No mapatumumab-specific toxicity was identified and no anti-mapatumum ab antibodies were detected. 
To assess its off-target effects, mapatumumab was administered intravenously weekly to cynomolgus monkeys, whose TRAIL R1 homolog does not bind mapatumumab. Mapatumumab was well tolerated at doses of up to 50 mg/kg and was not highly 
immunogenic: of the 40 monkeys treated, 1 developed anti-mapatumumab antibodies. The 
positive response was observed in an anim al in the high dose (50 mg/kg) group. 
In vitro, mapatumumab was found to decrease  viability of normal human hepatocytes, 
although the observed effect was less than that ob served with TRAIL. This  effect was variable 
across donors and did not amplify with increasi ng concentrations of mapatumumab. It should 
be noted that in clinical studies, plasma mapatu mumab concentrations have been achieved that 
are > 1100–fold greater than the minimum exposure  resulting in reduced in vitro hepatocyte 
viability. Despite this, the clinical results do no t reveal evidence of hepatotoxicity in those 
Human Genome Sciences, Inc. Confidential Page 19 
Protocol HGS1012-C1103 Amendment 01  Mapatumumab 
 
studies. Hence it appears that the in vitro hepatocyte viability assay is not predictive of 
mapatumumab effects in vivo. 
1.4.3 Clinical Experience with Mapatumumab 
Over 400 subjects have received mapatumumab in c linical trials to date. Preliminary clinical 
data are available from 218 subjects who rece ived mapatumumab as a single agent at doses 
ranging from 0.01 to 20 mg/kg across 6 clinical trials. 
Based on available data, mapatumumab appears to  be well tolerated and no significant safety 
issues have been observed. Adverse events have generally been mild to moderate in severity, 
manageable, and do not appear rela ted to dose. The most frequently reported treatment-related 
adverse events occurring in > 10% of subjects were fatigue, hypotension, nausea and pyrexia. 
Severe events have been uncommon and generally judged not relate d to mapatumumab. 
Severe events judged at leas t possibly related to mapatumumab have been observed and a 
complete list can be found in the mapatumumab Investigator’s Brochure. Grade 3 or Grade 4 
hematologic, renal, or hepatic laboratory a bnormalities also have been relatively uncommon 
with no significant trend or dose-response evident. Lymph openia was the most commonly 
observed laboratory abnormality, but tended to be intermittent and reversible and was not associated with infectious events. 
In subjects with solid tumors, stable dise ase has been the best response observed with 
mapatumumab as a single-agent. However, 2 complete responses  (CRs) and 1 partial response 
(PR) were observed in subj ects with follicular lymphoma. 
In addition, preliminary clinical data ar e available from 234 subjects who received 
mapatumumab at doses ranging from 1 to 30 mg/kg every 21 days in combination with 
chemotherapy in 5 clinical tr ials (carboplatin/paclitaxel [N  = 100], gemcitabine/cisplatin 
[N = 49], bortezomib [n = 69], or sorafenib [n = 16]. Mapatumumab ha s been generally well 
tolerated; adverse events and laboratory abnormalities have been consistent with those expected with underlying disease or chemothera py. A listing of severe events considered at 
least possibly related to mapatumumab can be  found in the mapatumumab Investigator’s 
Brochure. The most commonly occurring labora tory abnormalities have been hematologic 
(ie, anemia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, a nd leukopenia), as expected  with chemotherapy. 
Grade 3/4 laboratory abnormalities have been relatively uncommon. Higher frequencies of 
Grade 3/4 neutropenia, leukopenia, lymphopenia, and thrombocytopenia have been observed. Data from randomized Phase 2 studies in co mbination with chemotherapy suggest that 
mapatumumab may increase rates of lymphopenia. 
One subject receiving mapatumumab in combination with carboplatin/paclitaxel has 
achieved a CR. Twenty-two subjects receiv ing mapatumumab in combination with 
paclitaxel/carboplatin and 12 subjects rece iving mapatumumab in combination with 
gemcitabine/cisplatin have achieved PRs. Three subjects receiving mapatumumab in 
combination with bortezomib achieved CRs; 25 subjects receiving mapatumumab in combination with bortezomib achieved a PR.

1.5 Rationale for the Evaluation of  Mapatumumab in Combination with 
Sorafenib in Hepato cellular Carcinoma 
Sorafenib is the standard of care for treatment of patients with advanced hepatocellular 
carcinoma. Sorafenib is a multikinase inhibitor that targets the Raf/mitogen-activated protein 
kinase/extracellular sign al-regulated kinase signaling pathwa y, blocks tumor angiogenesis and 
induces apoptosis (Panka et al, 2006; Rahmani et al, 205; Yu et al, 2005; Wilhelm et al, 
2004). Sorafenib was approved by the European Medicines Agency and the Food and Drug 
Administration in 2007 for treatment of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma based on the demonstration of improved overall survival in  the 602 patient randomized, placebo-controlled, 
Phase 3 “Sorafenib Hepatocellular Carcinom a Assessment Randomized Protocol” (SHARP) 
trial. Approximately half the 602 patients had either hepatitis C virus or hepatitis B virus as underlying etiology and 26% had al cohol-related cirrhosis. The median overall survival was 
10.7 months for patients in the sorafenib arm co mpared with 7.0 months for patients in the 
placebo arm (hazard ratio in the sorafenib group, 0.69 95% confid ence interval, 0.55 to 0.87; 
p < 0.001). The median time to radiologic progression was 5.5 months in the sorafenib arm, compared with 2.8 months in the placebo arm (p < 0.0001) (Llovet et al, 2008). Seven patients 
in the sorafenib group (2%) and 2 patients in  the placebo group (1%) had a PR; no patients 
had a CR. 
A 2
nd randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 3 trial wa s conducted in the Asia-Pacific region 
(Cheng et al, 2009). The 226 patients randomly assi gned to sorafenib or placebo in this trial 
appeared to have more advanced disease than those in the SHARP trial, with a higher 
frequency of extrahepatic spread , poorer ECOG PS, and higher leve ls of AFP, but still showed 
a benefit from treatment with sorafenib. The majority (73%) had hepatitis B virus as an underlying etiology. The median overall survival was 6.5 months for patients in the sorafenib 
arm, compared with 4.2 months in the pl acebo group (hazard ratio , 0.68, 95% confidence 
interval, 0.50-0.93; p = 0.014). The median ti me to progression was 2.8 months in the 
sorafenib group, compared with 1.4 months in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.57, 95% confidence interval 0.42-0.79; p = 0.0005). 
The mechanisms of sorafenib and mapatumumab action suggest that these agents could 
interact synergistically. Sorafenib sensitizes human cancer cell lines, including cell lines 
derived from hepatocellular carcinoma, to apoptotic stimuli by reducing expression of apoptotic regulatory proteins; Mcl-1, Bcl-xL, and FLIP (Kim et al,2008; Koehler et al, 2009; Rosato et al, 2007; Liu et al , 2006; Rahmani et al, 2005; Yu et al, 2005). Mcl-1, Bcl-xL 
and FLIP have also been shown to mediate sensitivity of a wide range of tumor cell lines to TRAIL receptor agonists (Meng et al, 2007; Rosato et al, 2007; Llobet et al 2010; 
Blechacz et al, 2009; Katz et al, 2009; Huang and Sincrope, 2010; a nd Menoret et al, 2006). 
Recent studies demonstrated the combination of sorafenib with TRAIL or TRAIL receptor antibodies has significant activity  in hepatocellular carcinoma ce ll lines (Koehler et al, 2009) 
and colon tumor xenografts (Ricci et al, 2007) that were resistant to TRAIL and an antibody 
against TRAIL-R2. 
Mapatumumab activity has been evaluated precli nically in hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines 
by in vitro cytotoxicity assays  both as a single agent and in  combination with doxorubicin, 
cisplatin, gemcitabine or sorafenib. Single ag ent mapatumumab activity was observed in 4 of 
Human Genome Sciences, Inc. Confidential Page 21 
Protocol HGS1012-C1103 Amendment 01  Mapatumumab 
 
10 hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines. Increased in vitro cytotoxicity, including examples of 
synergy, were observed in 8 of 10 cell li nes when mapatumumab was combined with 
doxorubicin or cisplatin or the combination of cisplatin and gemcitabine (Humphreys et al, 
2008). Two of these hepatocellu lar carcinoma cell lines were evaluated for in vitro 
cytotoxicity of mapatumumab in combination with sorafenib. One displayed an increase in 
cytotoxicity from 30% to 60% when trea ted with a combination of sorafenib and 
mapatumumab. Importantly, treatment of a prim ary human hepatocyte cell line did not induce 
any apoptosis at doses of mapatumumab that were cytotoxic to hepato cellular carcinoma cell 
lines (  and  [personal communication], 2008; Abdulghani et al, 2008). 
Therefore, collectively, the expression of TRAIL-R1 in hepatocellular carcinoma and 
preclinical activity observed with combinati ons of mapatumumab with chemotherapy or 
sorafenib supports the rationale that this combination may be able to effectively target 
hepatocellular carcinoma. 
1.6 Rationale for Dose Selection 
As of June 2010, mapatumumab has been administered with chemotherapy (ie, carboplatin/paclitaxel, gemc itabine/cisplatin, bortezomib, or sorafenib) to 234 subjects, 
including 61 subjects who received 20 mg/k g and 50 subjects who received 30 mg/kg 
mapatumumab. Based on available data, mapatumumab in combination with chemotherapy is generally well tolerated at dose levels up to a nd including 30 mg/kg, a nd no significant safety 
issues have been observed in the course of the clinical trials even at the higher doses.   
Preliminary PK data are available for s ubjects who received 1, 10, 20 or 30 mg/kg 
mapatumumab in combination with gemcitabine and cisplatin (n = 49), 10 or 30 mg/kg mapatumumab in combination with paclitaxel  and carboplatin (n = 73), and 3, 10, or 
30 mg/kg mapatumumab in combination with sorafenib (n = 17). Serum or plasma mapatumumab concentrations are consistently within the range of expected concentrations predicted from Phase 1 study results in solid tumor patients administered mapatumumab as 
monotherapy. Mapatumumab PK is linear and not  affected by the addition of therapeutic 
agents. As expected, the observed peak and tr ough levels of mapatumumab at 30 mg/kg are 
2 to 3 times higher than those observed at 10 mg/kg. Exposure appears to increase in proportion to dose and exposures for a gi ven dose are similar across studies.  
A Phase 1b dose escalation study of mapatumumab in combination with sorafenib in subjects with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma who are positive for hepatitis  B surface antigen or 
hepatitis C antibody is being condu cted. Safety observations have  been consistent with the 
underlying disease and known sorafe nib toxicities. As of June 2010, 6 subjects have received 
3 mg/kg, 9 subjects have received 10 mg/k g, and 1 subject has received 30 mg/kg 
mapatumumab. The number of cycles completed ranges from 1 to 20; 4/16 (25.0%) of subjects have completed 11 or more cycles. Ad verse events have generally been consistent 
with published reports of the toxicities associated with sorafenib and prev ious experience 
with mapatumumab, as well as underlying disease. The most frequently occurring 
treatment-emergent adverse events, regardless  of severity or attribution of causality, 
include diarrhea (10/16, 62.5%), fatigue (9/16, 56.3%), nausea (9/16, 56.3%), and vomiting (7/16, 43.8%). Serious adverse events, regardless of attribution of causality, include 
hypertension, upper respiratory tract infection, atrial fibr illation, hyperbilirubinemia, 
PPD

hypoglycemia, and hepatic pain. Severe adverse even ts considered at leas t possibly related to 
mapatumumab or its interaction w ith sorafenib include elevated lipase (3/16, 18.8%), hepatic 
pain (1/16, 6.3%), and thrombocytopenia (1/16, 6.3%). Laboratory abnormalities have 
generally been mild or moderate in severity, manageable, and/or consistent with those expected with chemotherapy or the underlying di sease. The most frequent Grade 3 or Grade 4 
laboratory abnormalities include elevated total bilirubin (Grade 3, 4/16, 25.0%; Grade 4, 
1/16, 6.3%) and lymphopenia (Grade 3, 3/16,  18.8%; Grade 4, 2/16, 12.5%). Additional 
information on the safety experience can be found in the mapatumumab Investigators’ Brochure. 
Based on the information currently available, the safety profile continues to be favorable, 
supporting continued evaluati on of mapatumumab in combination with chemotherapy, 
including sorafenib. The maximum tolerated dose has not been reached in any of the Phase 1 or Phase 2 trials conducted to date. Thus , further evaluation of the 30 mg/kg dose is 
warranted. 
The dose of sorafenib for this study, 400 mg  twice daily, is the approved dose for the 
treatment of unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma. 
2 Study Objectives 
2.1 Primary Objective 
• To evaluate the efficacy of ma patumumab in combination with sorafenib in subjects with 
advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. 
 
2.2 Secondary Objective 
• To evaluate the safety of the mapatumumab in combination with sorafenib in subjects with 
advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. 
• To determine serum mapatumumab concentrations. 
 
3 Study Design 
3.1 Basic Design Characteristics 
This is a Phase 2, multi-cen ter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to 
evaluate the efficacy and safety of mapatumuma b in combination with sorafenib in subjects 
with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma.   
In addition to receiving sorafenib, subjects will be randomly assigned to 1 of 2 treatment 
groups in a 1:1 ratio: 30 mg/ kg mapatumumab or placebo. 
Mapatumumab will be supplied in open label vials and 3rd party unblinding will be employed. 
The study agent will be reconstituted by the unbli nded site pharmacist or unblinded designee. 
The unblinded site pharmacist or unblinded designee will also be the person responsible for 
receiving and dispensing study agent, but indepe ndent of all other study activities. All other 
study site personnel, the subject, and the Sponsor will remain blinded to the study agent 
Human Genome Sciences, Inc. Confidential Page 23 
Protocol HGS1012-C1103 Amendment 01  Mapatumumab 
 
received. Separate monitors will be responsib le for the clinical (blinded monitor) and study 
agent (unblinded monitor) aspects of the study. 
Number of Subjects: Approximately 100 subjects with advan ced HCC will be randomized/enrolled. 
Treatment Groups: Subjects will receive treatment every 21 days (ie, a cycle) as outlined below: Arm A: Sorafenib 400 mg orally twice daily continuously in each cycle + placebo 
intravenously on Day 1 of each cycle 
Arm B:  Sorafenib 400 mg orally twice daily continuously in each cycle + mapatumumab 
(30 mg/kg) intravenously on Day 1 of each cycle 
Randomization Randomization will be stratified according to BCLC advanced stage C vs BCLC intermediate 
stage B and ECOG performance status (0 vs 1, 2). Estimated Study Duration: The study is estimated to occur over approximately 24 months. Subjects will continue to 
receive sorafenib with or without mapatumumab/placebo until radiologic disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Estimated median le ngth of subject treatment is 6-8 months. All 
subjects will have an End of Tr eatment visit at least 30 days after the last dose of sorafenib 
and/or mapatumumab/placebo, whichever is later.  After discontinuation of  treatment, subjects 
will continue to be followed for radiologic disease assessments every 6 weeks (± 3 days), starting 6 weeks after the previous disease assessment while on treatment, until documented 
radiologic disease progression (if not previously documented). Thereafter, subjects will be followed every 3 months for survival until at least 90% of subjects have met the survival 
endpoint.

5 Study Treatment Regimen 
Sorafenib will be administered at a dose of 400 mg twice daily without  food (at least 1 hour 
before or 2 hours after a meal). On days wh en both sorafenib and mapatumumab/placebo are 
administered together, the sora fenib should be taken at the sa me time as any other calendar 
day. 
5.1 Mapatumumab and Placebo 
5.1.1 Formulation 
Mapatumumab will be supplied as  a lyophilized formulation in st erile, single-use 10 mL vials 
containing 100 mg mapatumumab. Upon reconstitu tion with 5.0 mL of sterile water for 
injection, each vial will contain 20 mg/mL mapatumumab in 0.13 mg/mL citric acid, 
2.8 mg/mL sodium citrate, 19 mg/mL glycine, 5 mg/mL sucrose, 0.2 mg/mL polysorbate 80, 
pH 6.5. 
Two hundred-fifty mL normal saline solution for intravenous infusion will be administered as 
placebo for mapatumumab. 
5.1.2 Packaging, Labeling, Preparation, and Storage 
The Pharmacy Manual will provide instructions for preparation and storage of study agent. 
The product will be securely stored at 2-8ºC. 
The study agent label will contain, at a minimum, the following information: 
• Product name 
• Concentration 
• Lot number 
• Storage instructions 
• Investigational drug statement 
• Manufacturer’s name and address 
 
Study agent inventory/accountability forms will be examined and reconciled by the unblinded 
study monitor or designee. At the end of the st udy, all used and unused investigational study 
agent will be accounted for on a study agent account ability form provided to the investigator 
by the Sponsor or designee. Pl ease refer to the HGS1012-C1103 Pharmacy Manual for more 
details regarding storage, handling and drug accountability. 
5.1.3 Mapatumumab/Placebo Dose, Route of Administration and Schedule 
The dose of mapatumumab is 30 mg/kg. Mapatumumab dose calculations will be based upon 
the subject’s weight measured on Day 1 or wi thin 3 days before Day 1 of each cycle. The 
planned duration of each treatment cycle will be 21 days. Mapatumumab/placebo will be administered on Day 1 of each cycle. 
Human Genome Sciences, Inc. Confidential Page 27 
Protocol HGS1012-C1103 Amendment 01  Mapatumumab 
 
After reconstitution with sterile water for injection, the calculated mapatumumab dose to be 
administered to the subject will be further di luted in normal saline to a total volume of 
250 mL for intravenous infusion. After adding the reconstituted product, the bag will be 
gently inverted to mix the solution. Following r econstitution and/or dilution in normal saline, 
mapatumumab will be stored at 2-8ºC. The product will be administered to the subject within 8 hours of reconstitution. Refer to the HGS 1012-C1103 Pharmacy Manual for instructions on 
admixing and administering study agent.  
Two hundred-fifty mL normal saline solution for intravenous infusion will be administered as 
placebo for mapatumumab. 
Mapatumumab/placebo will be infuse d at a constant rate over 1 hour. 
Infusion and hypersensitivity reactions may occu r. A suggested pre-medication regimen for 
mapatumumab/placebo consists of diphenhydram ine and acetaminophen administered within 
1 hour prior to the start of the mapatumumab/ placebo dose. Use of a pre-medication regimen 
and alternatives to this regimen are at the investigat or’s discretion. 
Subjects will be monitored closely during and after infusion for any sign of acute adverse 
reaction. If an allergic reaction occurs, see Section 5.1.5 and Appendix 8 for suggested 
medical management. 
5.1.4 Mapatumumab/Placebo Dose Toxicity/Delay 
Mapatumumab/placebo will be discontinued for Grade 4 transaminase elevations of any 
duration if they are considered related to mapatumumab. 
Mapatumumab/placebo may be delayed up to 2 weeks for toxicities considered related to 
mapatumumab as described below or if the investigator believes that a delay in dosing is 
warranted in the interest of subject safety. 
The National Cancer Institute Common Te rminology Criteria for Adverse Events 
(NCI-CTCAE, Version 4.0) will be used to grade AEs. 
• Grade 4 neutropenia for > 7 consecutive days or febrile neutropenia. 
• Grade 4 thrombocytopenia. 
• Grade 3 or greater non-hematologic AEs ex cept transient transaminase, amylase and 
lipase abnormalities for which the following criteria will apply: 
- Grade 3 or Grade 4 elevations in transami nases that do not resolve to baseline or 
Grade 1 before the next cycle. 
- Grade 3 elevations in lipase or amylase associated with clinical/imaging findings of pancreatitis, or resulting in ch ronic damage to the pancreas.  
- Any Grade 4 elevations in lipase or amylase for > 4 consecutive days. 
 If mapatumumab/placebo is delayed for toxi city and the toxicity does not resolve ( ≤ Grade 1) 
or return to baseline within 2 weeks after th e delayed dose was originally scheduled (based on 
a 21-day treatment cycle), the subject will be withdrawn fr om further treatment with AM01 
21Dec10 
Human Genome Sciences, Inc. Confidential Page 28 
Protocol HGS1012-C1103 Amendment 01  Mapatumumab 
 
mapatumumab/placebo. If mapatumumab/placebo is  delayed because the investigator believes 
a delay is warranted in the interest of subject safety and dosing of mapatumumab/placebo is 
not resumed within 2 weeks after the delaye d dose was originally scheduled (based on a 
21-day treatment cycle), the subject will be  withdrawn from future treatment with 
mapatumumab/placebo. Sorafenib dosing will  continue while mapatumumab/placebo dosing 
is held. The subject will continue receiving so rafenib until radiologic progressive disease or 
an unacceptable toxicity occurs, at the discretion of the Investigator.  
Doses of mapatumumab may not be altered. 
5.1.5 Management of Allergic/H ypersensitivity Reactions to 
Mapatumumab/Placebo 
The administration of any recombinant protein has the potential to induce local or system 
immunologic reactions; subjects co uld experience, for example, acute allergic reactions. To 
date, 2 such SAEs have been reported which were considered related to mapatumumab (hypersensitivity and angioedema/facial edema) . In the event of allergic/hypersensitivity 
reactions, investigators will institute treatment measures according to best medical and 
nursing practice. Guidelines for treatment are provided in Appendix 8. 
For a NCI-CTCAE Version 4.0 Grade 3 or Grade 4 hypersensitivity reac tion, treatment with 
mapatumumab/placebo will be discontinued. 
If mapatumumab/placebo is discontinued for Gr ade 3 or Grade 4 hypersensitivity reactions, 
the subject will continue to receive sorafeni b, until radiologic progression or unacceptable 
toxicity. 
5.2 Sorafenib 
5.2.1 Packaging, Labeling, Preparation, and Storage 
Sorafenib is supplied as tablet s, each containing 274 mg sorafenib tosylate, equivalent to 
200 mg of sorafenib. 
The recommended daily dose of sorafenib is 400 mg (2 x 200 mg tablets) taken orally twice 
daily without food (at least 1 hour be fore or 2 hours after a meal). 
Sorafenib will be stored at room temperature (15-30°C, 59-86°F) in a dry place. For country-specific formulation and packaging information, pleas e refer to the instructions 
provided in the sorafenib product labeling. Supplier: Commercially available.

include hypophosphatemia, lipase elevations , amylase elevations, hypoalbuminemia, 
international normalized ratio elevati ons, lymphopenia and thrombocytopenia. 
Refer to the product labeling accompanying th e product for information approved in your 
country. 
5.2.3 Alteration of Sorafenib Dose/Schedule Due to Toxicity 
Sorafenib may be reduced or delayed for toxicities considered related to sorafenib as 
described below, or if the inve stigator believes that a reduction in dose is warranted in the 
interest of subject safety. When a dose re duction is necessary, sorafenib dose may be 
reduced to 400 mg once daily. If an additiona l dose reduction is requir ed, sorafenib may be 
reduced to a single  400 mg dose every other day (see Table 5-1 ). A maximum of 2 dose 
reductions of sorafenib will be allowed per subject. Additional dose reductions not mentioned in Table 5-1  will need to be discussed with the medical monitor.

Skin toxicity and hypertension are associated with sorafenib. Guidelines for the management 
of these events are provided in Table 5-2  and Table 5-3 , respectively.  
Skin Toxicity 
Hand-foot skin reaction and rash are common in subjects treated with sorafenib. Management 
may include topical therapies for symptomatic relief, temporary treatment interruption and/or 
dose modification, or in severe or persistent cases, permanent discontinuation. Skin toxicities 
will be managed according to Table 5-2 .

< 10X upper limit of normal, Grade 3 hyperlipasemia or hyperamylasemia without clinical or other evidence of 
pancreatitis, Grade 3 leukopenia, or Grade 3/Grade 4 ly mphopenia may continue sorafenib treatment without 
interruption at the discretion of the investigator.  
 
Sorafenib Discontinuation Temporary or permanent discontinuation of sora fenib will be considered in subjects who 
develop cardiac ischemia and/or infarction or  severe or persistent hypertension despite 
institution of antihypertensive therapy. If a subject experiences a bleeding event that 
necessitates medical intervention or a gastrointestinal perforation, sorafenib will be AM01

Protocol HGS1012-C1103 Amendment 01  Mapatumumab 
 
permanently discontinued. Subjects, who undergo a surgical procedure or intervention to 
decrease portal hypertension, including transju gular intrahepatic porto systemic shunt, will 
discontinue sorafenib. 
If the subject is withdrawn from further treatment  with sorafenib, the subject may continue to 
receive mapatumumab/placebo alone every 21 days until radiologic progression or 
unacceptable toxicity. 
5.3 Concurrent Medicat ions and Therapies 
5.3.1 Allowable Regimens 
Subjects may continue their baseline medication( s). The daily dose of each medication will be 
maintained throughout the study if possible. If for any reason deemed necessary by the 
investigator, a subject requires additional medication(s), the medication(s) route of 
administration and the indication for which it was given must be recorded in the source 
documents. All concomitant medications will be r ecorded on the appropriate case report form. 
Systemic, inhaled and topical steroids used as part of an antiemetic regimen or 
maintenance-dose for non-cancerous disease are permitted. 
5.3.2 Prohibited Medications 
Subjects who require the use of strong CYP3A4  inducers (eg, including but not limited to 
St. John’s Wort, dexamethasone, phenytoin, carbamazepine, rifampin, rifabutin, 
phenobarbital) are not eligible for this study and use of these agents is prohibited as long as 
the subject is receiving sorafenib in this study. 
Subjects will not receive any investigational or noninvestigational cy totoxic chemotherapy, 
hormonal therapy, biological therapy (including monoclonal antibodies) or immunotherapy to 
treat hepatocellular carcinoma during the treatm ent period. Alternativ e anticancer therapies 
may be administered after radiologic disease progression has been documented, but will be avoided if possible during the 30 day safety fo llow up period after the last dose of study agent 
(mapatumumab/placebo and/or sorafenib) whicheve r is last. These medications are allowed in 
the long-term follow-up period after the 30 day safety follow-up period and documentation of radiologic disease progression. 
5.3.3 Prohibited Therapies 
Subjects will not undergo major or  elective surgery during the trea tment period of the study; if 
surgery is required, the subject will be withdrawn from study treatment. 
6 Study Procedures 
6.1 Screening Procedures 
The nature of this study and the potential risks and benef its associated with participation in the 
study will be explained to all potential study subjects. Written informed consent (including 
consent for the use and disclosure  of research-related health information) must be obtained 
before any screening procedures  are performed that are not c onsidered standard of care. AM01 
21Dec10 
Human Genome Sciences, Inc. Confidential Page 33 
Protocol HGS1012-C1103 Amendment 01  Mapatumumab 
 
All of the following assessments must be perf ormed within 28 days prior to enrollment: 
• Obtain written informed consent for participation in the study. 
• Obtain informed consent for participa tion in the optional biomarker sub-study. 
- If consented, obtain tissue block/slides or cell pellet from diagnostic histologic/ 
cytologic sample. 
• Record demographics. 
• Obtain medical history, to include history of all treatments used to tr eat the current cancer 
and all prior cancer treatments. 
• Perform baseline complete physical examin ation including body weight and height. 
• Assess vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, respirat ory rate and temperature). 
• Evaluate performance status (ECOG scale; see Appendix 3). 
• Draw blood for laboratory tests (see Appendix 7): complete blood count with differential, 
chemistry , hepatitis B surface antigen, Hepatitis  B virus DNA, hepatitis C antibody and 
testing for serum pregnancy (all females with an intact uterus [unless amenorrheic for the 
previous 24 months] regardless of age). 
• Obtain radiologic disease and AFP assessments . The method of disease assessment, as per 
mRECIST for HCC (see Appendix 5), will be consistent throughout the study.  
• Obtain electrocardiogram. 
• Record medications used within 28 days before enrollment. 
• Confirm that subject meets all inclusion/exclusion criteria. 
 
6.2 Study Enrollment/Randomization Procedures 
Subjects that meet the eligibility criteria will be randomly assigned treatment by a 
central interactive voice response system in a 1:1 ratio to 1 of 2 treatment arms. The 
randomization will be stratified according to BCLC advanced stage C vs BCLC intermediate 
stage B and ECOG performance status (0 vs 1, 2). The 1st planned dose of sorafenib and 
mapatumumab/placebo will be administered no  more than 3 days following randomization 
and not prior to randomization. All study site personnel (with the exception of the unblinded site pharmacist or unblinded designee), the subjec t, and the Sponsor will remain blinded to the 
study agent received.

1 Safety Labs: Day 1 (complete blood count with differential, coagulation parameters [INR, PT, PTT] and chemistry) must be performed within 3 days prior to dosing on Day 1 of each 
cycle.  See Appendix 7 for a detailed list of required laboratory assessments. 
2 Pregnancy: Serum test at screening, urine test pre-dose Cy cle 1 Day 1; must be negative to receive treatment. 
3 B and T lymphocyte subsets: Blood samples for quantification of  B and T lymphocytes will be obtained in Cycles 1 and 2 only. S amples will be obtained on Day 1 (prior to dosing) and 
Day 15 of Cycles 1 and 2. 
4 Immunogenicity: Obtain prior to dosing on Day 1 of Cycles 1, 2,  4, 6, every 2 cycles thereafter and at the end of treatment vi sit (at least 30 days after the last dose). On days when 
immunogenicity and pharmacokinetic samples are collected they will be collected together. 
5 Pharmacokinetics: Blood specimens will be collected for determinati on of serum mapatumumab concentra tions from subjects as fol lows:  Cycle 1 (on Day 1 prior to the administration 
mapatumumab/placebo and at the completion of the mapatumumab/pla cebo infusion, and on Day 8), Cycles 2, 4 and 6 and thereafter on each even cycle (prior to dosing on Day 1), 
on the day of each disease assessment, and at the end of treatment visit (at least 30 days after the last dose). On days when i mmunogenicity and pharmacokinetic samples are 
collected they will be collected together.   
6 Biomarkers: For subjects parti cipating in the optional biomarker sub-study, hi storical biopsy samples will be collected, if av ailable, and samples will be collected if obtained during the 
treatment period in Cycle 1 Days 1 (pre-dose mapatumumab), 2, 3, 8 and 15 and Cycle 2 Days 1 (pre-dose mapatumumab), 3, 8 and 1 5. In addition, blood samples will be obtained 
as follows: blood for isolation of DNA will be collected once, pref erably in Cycle 1. Blood for isolation of serum will be coll ected in Cycles 1 and 2 (pre-dose on the day of 
mapatumumab/placebo dosing). Further details on the biomarker sub-study are outlined in Appendix 6 .

 6.4 Follow-up Procedures 
6.4.1 Safety Follow-up 
After discontinuation of study trea tment, all subjects will return 1 day af ter cycle completion 
(approximately Day 22) and at least 30 days after the last dose of sorafenib and/or 
mapatumumab/placebo, for scheduled safety follow-up assessments as outlined in Table 6-1 . 
6.4.2 Long-term Follow-up For subjects discontinuing treatment  prior to documentation of ra diologic disease progression, 
and for subjects who experience stable diseas e or a response (PR, CR) but are no longer 
receiving treatment, radiologic disease assessments will be performed at 6 week intervals 
(± 3 days), starting 6 weeks after the previo us radiologic disease assessment while on 
treatment, until radiologic disease progression is documented. Thereafter, subjects will be followed every 3 months for survival until at least 90%  of subjects have met the survival 
endpoint. 
6.5 Withdrawal of S ubjects from Treatment 
Subjects will be free to withdraw  from treatment at any time, for any reason, or they may be 
withdrawn/removed, if necessary, to protect thei r health (see reasons for withdrawal below). It 
is understood by all concerned that an excessi ve rate of withdrawals can render the study 
uninterpretable; therefore, unnecessary wit hdrawal of subjects will be avoided. 
Subjects may be withdrawn from treatment for any of the following reasons: 
• Radiologic disease progression. 
• Continued unacceptable toxicities despite optimal treatment or dose reduction. 
• Intercurrent illness, at the investigator’s discretion. 
• Withdrawal of consent. 
• Non-compliance/Lost to follow-up. 
• Pregnancy. 
• Termination of the study by the sponsor. 
 Subjects who withdraw are to be followed for radiologic progression as outlined in Section 6.4.2. In addition, every effort will be made to collect safety information on each 
subject through 30 days following the last dose of study treatment, unless the subject withdraws consent and refuses to comply with the protocol stipulated safety follow-up and 
radiologic disease progression assessments, or sh are information obtained after the date of 
withdrawal of consent. 
6.6 Withdrawal of Subjects from Study 
Subjects may be withdrawn from the study for any of the following reasons: 
• Withdrawal of consent. 
Human Genome Sciences, Inc. Confidential Page 38 
Protocol HGS1012-C1103 Amendment 01  Mapatumumab 
 
 • Non-compliance/Lost to follow-up. 
• Termination of the study by the sponsor. 
 
Every effort will be made to collect follow-up information on subjects in the long-term follow-up period of the study, unless the subjec t withdraws consent and refuses to share 
information obtained during the long-term fo llow-up period obtained after the date of 
withdrawal of consent. 
6.7 Disease Respon se Assessments 
Imaging endpoints will be determined using th e modified RECIST criteria for HCC proposed 
by Lencioni and Llovet (2010; mRECIST). mREC IST for HCC is a joint guideline of the 
American Association for the Study of Liver Di seases and the Journal of the National Cancer 
Institute.  
Lesions which manifest typical imaging charac teristics for HCC demonstrate intratumoral 
arterial contrast on CT and MRI images. mR ECIST accounts for newer therapies which may 
impact tumor vascularity and may not yield a t ypical cytotoxic decrease in tumor size by 
incorporating changes in vascular ity into the criteria for target  lesion response. Diligence in 
obtaining images during the hepatic arterial cont rast enhancement phase is a requirement at 
baseline and all subsequent scans. The same imaging method must be used at baseline and 
during follow up. As in conventional RECIST, overall response is the result of the combined assessment of 
target, nontarget, and new lesions. There are also  specifications for inco rporating portal vein 
thrombosis, portal hepatic lymph nodes, and pl eural effusions/ascites into the response 
assessment. As with conventional RECIST, th e appearance of any ne w lesion overrides any 
existing lesion response, resulting in classification as progressive  disease (PD). Key aspects of 
mRECIST as adapted for this study are summarized in Appendix 4. 
Baseline images will be provided to the BICR for confirmation of radiologic eligibility 
(measurable disease). Confirmation of radiologic eligibility for the study will be provided to the site by the BICR within 72 hours of receipt of images and will be required for randomization. 
Disease assessments and an assessment of α -fetoprotein will be perf ormed at the end of every 
2 cycles (ie, Cycles 2, 4, 6 and every 2 cy cles thereafter). The response assessment will be 
performed and documented no more than 5 days befo re the start of the next cycle. All images 
will be provided to the BICR following each disease assessment. If disease progression is based only on new lesion s or is equivocal, images will be provided to 
the BICR for confirmation of ra diologic disease progression prior to disc ontinuing study 
treatment. PR and CR will be confirmed at the next scheduled disease assessment (no fewer 
than 4 weeks after the initial  documentation of PR or CR).

 7 Pharmacokinetic, Immunogenicity, Pharmacodynamic and 
Exploratory Assessments 
7.1 Pharmacokinetic Assessments 
For determination of mapatumumab concentration, serum samples will be collected as 
outlined in Table 6-1 . 
A manual will be provided regarding how to obtain blood samples, process samples, collect serum from the blood samples, and how to store and ship the serum samples. Bioanalysis will 
be carried out at Human Genome Sciences to  determine mapatumumab concentration in each 
serum sample. 
7.2 Immunogenicity 
Blood samples for serum antibodies to mapatumumab will be obtained as outlined in  Table 6-1 .  
7.3 Pharmacodynamic Assessments 
Subjects will be given the option to particip ate in an exploratory biomarker research 
sub-study. Consenting subjects will be asked to provide a historically obtained biopsy sample, if available, and blood samples. In addition, samples will be requested from subjects who undergo a biopsy during the treatment period. 
To examine and quantify biomarkers present peripherally, blood will be drawn during 
Cycles 1 and 2, from which DNA and serum pr oteins will be isolated. The parameters 
evaluated may include, but may not be limited to, M30, TNF α, sTRAIL, soluble Fas ligand, 
interferon- α, interferon- γ, interleukin-2, interleukin-6, interleukin-8, interleukin-10, 
interleukin-12, and FC gamma receptor an d interleukin-6 gene polymorphisms. The 
biomarker sub-study is detailed in Appendix 6.  
7.4 Exploratory Assessments (B  and T Lymphocyte Subsets) 
7.4.1 Rationale for B and T Lymphocyte Analysis 
Over 400 subjects have received mapatumumab in doses ranging from 0.01 to 30 mg/kg 
across multiple Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials in subjects with solid and hematologic malignancies. While there is no evidence to date that mapatumumab exacerbates adverse events associated with chemotherapy, the most commonly observed laboratory abnormality 
associated with mapatumumab has been lym phopenia. The lymphopenia has been intermittent 
and reversible and was not associated with infectious events. However, the lymphocyte 
subpopulation(s) affected have not been characterized. 
The evaluation of lymphocytes will include co mplete blood count/diffe rential and lymphocyte 
subpopulation analysis (numbers and percentage s of T and B cells) by flow cytometry at a 
central laboratory. Blood samples will be examin ed by flow cytometry for levels of T helper 
(CD4+), T cytotoxic (CD8+) and mature B cells (CD19+). 
Human Genome Sciences, Inc. Confidential Page 40 
Protocol HGS1012-C1103 Amendment 01  Mapatumumab 
 
 7.4.2 Collection of Samples for B and T Lymphocyte Analysis 
Blood samples will be collected for quantification of B and T lymphocyte subsets on Day 1 
(prior to dosing) and Day 15 of Cycles 1 and 2 as outlined in Table 6-1 . 
8 Adverse Event Reporting 
8.1 Definitions 
ADVERSE EVENT (EXPERIENCE) - any unfavorab le or unintended sign, symptom, or 
disease that is temporally associated with the use of a study agent but is not necessarily caused 
by the study agent. This includes worsening (e g, increase in frequency or severity) of 
pre-existing conditions. 
SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT – an adverse event re sulting in any of the following outcomes: 
• death 
• is life threatening (ie, an immediate threat to life) 
• inpatient hospitalization 
• prolongation of an existing hospitalization 
• persistent or significant disability / incapacity 
• congenital anomaly / birth defect 
• is Medically Important* 
 
*Medical and scientific judgment will be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting is appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be immediately 
life threatening or result in death or result in hospitalization but may jeopardize the patient or may require intervention to pr event one of the other outcomes listed above. These should also 
usually be considered serious . (ICH guidelines, March 1995) 
Note: Hospitalizations not associated with an adverse event, for example, for administration 
of chemotherapy or hydration for chemotherapy administration, are not considered serious 
adverse events. 
UNEXPECTED ADVERSE EVENT - An adverse event,  the nature or seve rity of which is 
not consistent with the applicable product info rmation (eg, Investigator’s Brochure for an 
unapproved investigational product or package insert/summary of  product characteristics for 
an approved product). Expected means that the event has previously been observed with the 
study agent and is identified and/or described in the applicable product information. It does 
not mean that the event is expected with  the underlying diseas e(s) or concomitant 
medications. 
8.2 Reporting Adverse Events to  the Sponsor or Designee 
All adverse events (AEs) that are identified from th e start of any study agent administration 
through the specified study follow-up period (t hrough 30 days following administration of the 
Human Genome Sciences, Inc. Confidential Page 41 
Protocol HGS1012-C1103 Amendment 01  Mapatumumab 
 
 final study agent dose) will be recorded on th e paper/electronic Adverse Event Case Report 
Form (AE case report form). All data fields on the AE case report form will be completed. 
Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) must ALSO be recorded on the SAE Worksheet and sent to 
HGS within 24 hours of site personnel becoming aware of a SAE, regardless of expectedness. 
All pages of the SAE Worksheet will be comple ted, but the SAE worksheet will not be held 
until all information is available. Additional information and corrections will be provided on 
subsequent SAE Worksheets as described in  the Study Procedure Manual. SAE Worksheets 
will be sent by facsimile to the Drug Safety Department at HGS using the fax number listed below. 
FAX #:  
8.3 Laboratory Abnormalities as Adverse Events 
A laboratory abnormality will be reported as an adverse event if it is associated with an 
intervention. Intervention include s, but is not limited to, discontinuation of treatment, dose 
reduction/delay, additional assessments (excluding follow-up labs), or concomitant therapy. In 
addition, any medically important laboratory abnormality may be reported as an adverse event 
at the discretion of the inves tigator. This includes laboratory  abnormalities for which there is 
no intervention but the abnormal value(s) suggests  a disease or organ toxicity. If clinical 
sequelae are associated with a laboratory abnormality, the diagnos is or medical condition will 
be reported (eg, renal failure, hematuria) not the laboratory abnormality (eg, elevated creatinine, urine red blood cells increased). 
8.4 Other Events Requiring Rapid Reporting 
Protocol Specified Events are additional events [toxicities] specifically identified in this protocol that must be reported to Human Ge nome Sciences or designee in an expedited 
manner. Protocol Specified Events may or may not be SAEs as defined in  this protocol. They 
are SAEs if they meet one or more of  the criteria for an SAE (see Section 8.1). Protocol 
Specified Events are recorded on SAE Worksheets and sent to Human Genome Sciences within 24 hours of site personnel becoming aware of the event. 
The Protocol Specified Events for the study: 
• Grade 4 neutropenia for > 7 consecutive days or febrile neutropenia. 
• Grade 4 thrombocytopenia. 
• Grade 3 or greater non-hematologic AEs except transaminase, amylase and lipase 
abnormalities for which the following criteria apply: 
• Grade 4 elevations in transaminases. 
• Grade 4 elevations in lipase or amylase. 
• Grade 3 elevations in lipase or amylase associated with clinical/imaging findings of pancreatitis, resulting in chr onic damage to the pancreas. 
• Any adverse event that results in discontinuation of treatment if that event is assessed as possibly, probably, or definitely related to mapatumumab or sorafenib. AM01

 8.5 Reporting a Pregnancy 
Any pregnancy in a female participant or a female partner of a male participant  must be 
reported to Human Genome Sciences Drug Safety as soon as the site becomes aware of the 
pregnancy. All pregnancies are reported up to 30 days following the last study agent 
treatment. Human Genome Sciences Drug Safe ty sends an acknowledgement memorandum to 
the principal investigator along with a Pre gnancy Assessment Form. Additional Pregnancy 
Assessment Forms will be sent to the site every 3 months for reporting of follow-up 
information. Pregnancy assessment forms must be completed by the investigator until live birth, elective termination of the pregnancy, or miscarriage. The site is responsible for 
following the subject’s pregnancy to final outcome. 
Pregnancies are not considered adverse events. Complications or medical problems associated 
with a pregnancy are considered AEs and may be SAEs. Complications or medical problems 
are reported as AEs/SAEs according to the procedure described in Section 8.2. 
8.6 Investigator Evalua tion of Adverse Events 
The Investigator will evaluate all adverse events with respect to seriousness (criteria listed in 
Section 8.1 above), severity (intensity or grade) and causality (relationship to study agent) 
according to the following guidelines listed below. 
SEVERITY Severity will be graded using the NCI-C TCAE, Version 4.0. The NCI-CTCAE may 
be downloaded from the Cancer Treatment Evaluation Program website 
(http://ctep.info.nih.gov/reporting/ctc.html). In  the event that an AE does not have an 
NCI-CTCAE code, the following severity  classifications will be used: 
Mild  causing no limitation of usual activities 
Moderate causing some limitation of usual activities Severe causing inability to carry out usual activities Life Threatening* potentially lif e threatening or disabling  
 
*Note – a severity assessment of life threatening is  not necessarily the sa me as life threatening 
as a “Serious” criterion. The latter means that  the event is an immedi ate threat to life as 
opposed to a potential threat to life.

Protocol HGS1012-C1103 Amendment 01  Mapatumumab 
 
 CAUSALITY 
Definitely Related reasonable temporal relationship to study agent administration 
 follows a known response pattern (eg, drug is known to cause this AE) 
 there is no alternative etiology 
Probably Related reasonable temporal relationship  follows a suspected response patter n (eg, based on similar drugs) 
 no evidence for a more likely alternative etiology 
Possibly Related reasonable temporal relationship  little evidence for a more likely alternative etiology 
Probably Not Related does not have a reasonable temporal relationship, OR 
 good evidence for a more lik ely alternative etiology 
Not Related does not have a temporal relationship, OR  definitely due to alternative etiology  
 ICH guidelines (March, 1995) clarif y “reasonable causal relationshi p” to mean “that there are 
facts [evidence] or arguments to  suggest a causal relationship”. 
The causality assessment must be made by the i nvestigator based on information available at 
the time that the SAE worksheet is completed. The initial causality asse ssment may be revised 
as new information becomes available. 
 *Note -  If there is evidence that mapatumumab/ placebo contributed to or exacerbated an 
event related to sorafenib; the event will be recorded as possibly, probably or definitely 
related to both sorafenib and mapatumumab. 
8.7 Follow-up of Adverse Events 
Adverse events that occur during the course of the study are followed until final outcome is 
known or until the end of the safety follow-up pe riod (30 days following th e final dose of any 
study agent). Adverse events  that have not resolved by the e nd of the safety follow-up period 
are recorded as ongoing. 
SAEs that have not resolved by the end of the follow-up pe riod are followed until final 
outcome of recovered or recovere d with sequelae is ach ieved. If it is not possible to obtain a 
final outcome for a SAE (eg, the subject is lost  to follow up), the reason a final outcome could 
not be obtained will be documented by the investigator. 
8.8 Serious Adverse Events Assessed During Long-Term Follow-up 
SAEs that occur after the safety follow-up period (30 days following the final dose of study 
agent) that are assessed by the investigator as po ssibly, probably, or defi nitely related to study 
agent must be reported to Human Genome Sciences on an SAE worksheet, as described in Section 8.2. Post-study SAEs will not be documented on the AE case report form. 
Human Genome Sciences, Inc. Confidential Page 44 
Protocol HGS1012-C1103 Amendment 01  Mapatumumab 
 
 8.9 Reporting Serious Ad verse Events to the Institutional Review 
Board/Ethics Committee 
All SAEs that are considered unexpected and related to the study agen t will be reported by 
Human Genome Sciences or its designee as exped ited (ie, 15-Day) reports to the appropriate 
regulatory authorities AND to all participating i nvestigators. Each invest igator must notify the 
Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics Comm ittee (IEC) responsible for 
reviewing the study at their site of all expedited reports. In addition, Human Genome Sciences 
or its designee will follow all applicable local and national regulatory requirements regarding safety reporting. Each investigator must also comply with the applicable regulatory requirements related to the repor ting of SAEs to the IRB/IEC responsible for reviewing the 
study at their site, as well as the regu latory authority(ies) (if applicable). 
9 Endpoints and Stat istical Analysis 
9.1 General Statistical Considerations 
Analyses will be applied to a modified intentio n-to-treat population unl ess stated otherwise. 
This population is defined as the set of all ra ndomized subjects who receive at least 1 dose of 
study treatment (mapatumumab/placebo and/or sora fenib) with subjects analyzed according to 
the groups they are randomized to, regardless of the treatment they subsequently receive. 
Additional analyses may be performed on the as -treated population, defined as the set of 
subjects receiving at least 1 dose of study medi cation analyzed according to the treatment that 
they actually receive. 
Analyses will be performed using the SAS System™, WinNonlin Enterprise Edition™, 
StatXact™, and the R statistical package. 
9.2 Sample Size Rationale 
A total of approximately 100 subjects will be randomly assigned to 1 of 2 arms and treated 
with either sorafenib + placebo or the 2-agent combination of sorafenib and mapatumumab at 
30 mg/kg in a 1:1 ratio. A sample size of 50 subjects randomized and treated in each group is sufficient to estimate the median time to progre ssion with a precision of approximately -1.9 M 
to +2.6 M relative to the observed median. In  addition, a sample size of 50 patients per arm 
will provide 80% power to detect an improveme nt in TTP from 5.5 to 8.9 M with at a 
one-sided significance level of 0.10.  
9.3 Efficacy 
9.3.1 Primary Efficacy Endpoint 
The primary endpoint is time to progression (TTP) defined as the time from randomization to 
radiologic disease progression based on blinded independent review of imaging scans.  
9.3.2 Primary Efficacy Analysis 
The primary analysis will be an estimate of median time to progressi on in each arm using 
Kaplan Meier methods, reported with 95% confid ence intervals, along with testing the hazard 
Human Genome Sciences, Inc. Confidential Page 45 
Protocol HGS1012-C1103 Amendment 01  Mapatumumab 
 
 ratio for time to progression at a 1-sided sign ificance level of 0.10 with a Cox proportional 
hazards model controlling for the factors stratifying the randomization as covariates. 
9.3.3 Secondary Efficacy Endpoints 
Secondary endpoints include progression-free su rvival, overall response, disease control, 
overall survival, time to response, and duration of response (for responde rs) as defined below: 
• OS: time from randomization to death from any cause. 
• PFS: time from randomization to disease progression or death from any cause. 
• Objective response (CR+PR according to mRECIST for HCC). 
• Disease control (CR+PR+SD according to mRECIST for HCC). 
• Time to response: time from randomization to 1st PR or CR in responders only. 
• Duration of response: time from 1st PR or CR to disease progression; in responders only. 
 
All secondary endpoints will be based on blinded independent review of imaging scans. 
9.3.4 Secondary Efficacy Analyses 
Secondary analyses include estimates, using Kaplan Meier methods, of median PFS and 
median OS along with associated  logrank testing. In addition,  estimates of overall response 
rate (CR+PR) and disease control rate (CR+PR +SD) will be reported with 95% confidence 
intervals and an estimate of the difference in response rates and diseas e control rates between 
groups will be reported and tested for significance with a Pearson chi-square test (or Fisher’s 
exact test).  
9.4 Safety 
9.4.1 Definition of Safety Variables  The safety parameters assessed are given by the following: 
• Frequency, and severity of adverse events (AEs): 
- All AEs will be classified by System Or gan Class and Preferred Term under the 
Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) system of classification with 
a severity assigned accordi ng to the NCI-CTCAE (Version 4.0, 29 May 2009), or the 
rules specified in Section 8.6. 
- Laboratory parameters as presented in Appendix 7 . 
- Laboratory toxicities will be graded based on the NCI-CTCAE (Version 4.0, 29 May 2009). 
• Anti-mapatumumab antibody response.  
• Vital signs. 
• For frequency and severity of adverse events  and laboratory toxicity  grading, counts and 
rates will be presented.

 9.4.2 Human Genome Sciences Safety Review Committee 
The Human Genome Sciences Re view Committeee (HGSRC) is co mprised of the Department 
Heads of Biostatistics, Regulatory Affairs and Drug Development. The HGSRC will review 
safety data after: (1) 10 subjects have comple ted 1 cycle; and (2) 30 subjects have completed 
1 cycle. HGSRC reviews of safety data will  be conducted approximately every 4 months 
thereafter, until 90% of subjects have reached radiologic progression. The HGSRC may 
conduct additional reviews at thei r own request and/or at the re quest of the Medical Monitor. 
The HGSRC may request the un blinding of treatment assignment for a subject and/or 
treatment groups. If treatment assignments are unblinded, the rationale for the unblinding will 
be documented. 
9.4.3 Analysis of Safety Variables 
The safety analysis will consist of a presentati on of rates of AEs observed. Specific AEs will 
be counted once for each subject for calculating rate s, but will be presented in total in subject 
listings. In addition, if the same AE occurs multiple times within a particular subject, the 
highest severity and level of causality observed will be reported. If any associations of interest 
between AEs and baseline characteristics are ob served, additional stratified results may be 
presented. All treatment-emergent AEs will be summarized overall, as well as categorized by 
the MedDRA system of classification. AEs will be presented overall, by severity, by relation 
to mapatumumab/placebo, and by relation to sorafenib. 
9.5 Pharmacokinetics 
9.5.1 Definition of Pharmacokinetic Evaluation Serum mapatumumab concentration data obtained from this study will be pooled with data 
obtained from other studies fo r use in a population PK analys is, which will be reported 
separately. 
9.5.2 Analysis of Pharmacokinetics 
The serum mapatumumab concentration will be determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent 
assay. Serum mapatumumab concentration resu lts for this study will be presented using 
appropriate graphic and tabular summaries. 
9.6 Pharmacodynamics 
Expression of biomarkers in tumor tissue and pe ripheral blood will be correlated with clinical 
outcomes and may be reported separately  from the clinical study report.  
10 Study Administration 
10.1 Informed Consent 
A copy of the proposed informed consent document(s) must be submitted to the sponsor or designee for review and comment prior to submission to the reviewing IRB/IEC. The consent 
form must be approved by the IRB/IEC and contain all elements required by national, state, local, and institutional regulations or requirements. 
Human Genome Sciences, Inc. Confidential Page 47 
Protocol HGS1012-C1103 Amendment 01  Mapatumumab 
 
 It is the responsibility of the investigator to pr ovide each subject with full and adequate verbal 
and written information using the IRB/IEC approved informed consent document(s), 
including the objective and pro cedures of the study and the possible risks involved before 
inclusion in the study. Each subject must vo luntarily provide written informed consent 
(including consent for the use and disclosure of  research-related health information). The 
consent must be obtained prior to  performing any study-related proc edures that are not part of 
normal patient care, including sc reening and changes in medications including any washout of 
medications. A copy of the signed informed c onsent must be given to the study subject. 
10.2 Institutional Review Board Re view/Independent Ethics Committee 
Review  and Approval 
The investigator or sponsor (a s appropriate per national regula tions) shall assure that an 
IRB/IEC, constituted in accordance with ICH Good Clinical Practices, will provide initial and 
continuing review of the study. 
Prior to shipment of the study agent and enrollment of study subjects, documented IRB/IEC 
approval of the protocol, informed consen t form, and any advertisement for subject 
recruitment must be obtained and prov ided to the sponsor or designee. 
The IRB/IEC must also be informed of all prot ocol amendments prior to implementation. The 
investigator must provide reports of any cha nge in research activity (ie, the completion, 
termination, or discontinuation of a study) to the IRB/IEC. 
10.3 Protocol Compliance 
Except for a change that is intended to elimin ate an apparent immediate hazard to a study 
subject, the protocol shall be conducted as described. Any such change must be reported 
immediately to the sponsor and to the IRB/IEC. 
10.4 Protocol Revisions 
Protocol amendments will be prepared and appr oved by the sponsor. All protocol amendments 
will be signed by the investigator and submitted to the IRB/IEC for review prior to 
implementation. Documentation of IRB/IEC approval must be forwarded to the sponsor or designee. If an amendment signif icantly alters the st udy design, increases potential risk to the 
subject or otherwise affects statements in th e informed consent form, the informed consent 
form must be revised accordingly and submitted to the IRB/IEC for review and approval. The approved consent form must be us ed to obtain informed consen t from new subjects prior to 
enrollment and must be used to obtain informed consent from subjects already enrolled if they are affected by the amendment. 
10.5 Data Collection and Management 
Data collected for each study subject are re corded electronically on case report forms 
provided or approved by the sponsor.  
Human Genome Sciences, Inc. Confidential Page 48 
Protocol HGS1012-C1103 Amendment 01  Mapatumumab 
 
 The investigator is responsible for maintaining accurate, complete, and up-to-date records for 
each subject. The investigator is also responsible for maintaining any source documents related to the study, incl uding any films, tracings, computer discs, or tapes. The investigator 
must promptly review the completed case report forms for each subject. As the person ultimately responsible for the accura cy of all data, the investigator must sign the Investigator's 
Statement in each subject's case report form. 
The anonymity of participating subjects must be maintained. Subjects are identified by an 
assigned subject number on case report forms and other documents submitted to the sponsor. 
Documents that identify the subject beyond subj ect number are not submitted to the sponsor 
(ie, the signed informed consent document) and must be maintained in strict confidence by the 
investigator, except to the extent necessary to  allow auditing by the regulatory authorities, 
study monitor, or sponsor representatives. 
Sites enter subject data directly into the el ectronic data capture (EDC) system and the EDC 
system automatically generates queries result ing from computer checks embedded into the 
system, so as to ensure accuracy, quality, consistency, and completeness of the database. 
Manual queries resulting from review by m onitors, medical coders, and other Data 
Management staff are also generated from w ithin the EDC system, where they are tracked. 
Sites resolve the queries and correct the entered data when necessary. Every change to data is 
captured in the EDC system audit trail. At study end, each site is provided with a compact disk containing the electronic case re port forms for each of their subjects. 
Upon completion of the study, or after reaching a pre-specified point in the study, Data Management locks the database and generates the SAS datasets necessary for data analysis 
and reporting. 
10.6 Study Monitoring 
The study sponsor, Human Genome Sciences, Inc., or designee, will monitor the study. Study 
monitors representing the sponsor will visit study sites routinely throughout the trial. The 
sponsor will review the paper subject diarie s and electronic case report forms and compare 
them with source documents to verify accurate and complete collection of data and confirm that the study is being conducted according to the protocol. Auditors representing the sponsor 
may also similarly evaluate the study and its monitors. For these purpos es, the investigator 
will make paper subject diaries and electronic case report forms and source documents available when requested. 
In addition, the study may be evaluated by  representatives of the national regulatory 
authorities, who will also be allowed access to study documents. The investigators will 
promptly notify Human Genome Sciences of any audits they have scheduled with any 
regulatory authority. 
10.7 Drug Accountability 
Upon receipt, the designated unblinded pharmacy personnel at the study site are responsible 
for taking an inventory of the study agent, incl uding any buffers or dilu ents. A record of this 
Human Genome Sciences, Inc. Confidential Page 49 
Protocol HGS1012-C1103 Amendment 01  Mapatumumab 
 
 inventory must be kept and usage must be documented on study agent inventory forms 
provided by the sponsor. 
Study agent inventory forms will be examined  and reconciled by an unblinded Clinical 
Research Associate, or designee. At the end of the study, all used and unused study agent 
must be accounted for on a study agent accountability form provided to the investigator by 
Human Genome Sciences or its designee. 
10.8 Retention of Records 
The investigator shall retain  all records and source documents pertaining to the study, 
including any films, tracings, computer discs, or tapes. They will be retained for the longer of 
the maximum period required by the country and institution in which the study is conducted, 
or the period specified by the sponsor at the time the study is completed, terminated, or 
discontinued. 
If the investigator leaves the institution, the records shall be transfer red to an appropriate 
designee who accepts the responsibility for record retention. Notice of such transfer shall be 
documented in writing and provided to the sponsor. 
10.9 Financial Disclosure 
The investigator will provide Human Genome Sc iences sufficient and accurate information on 
financial interests (proprietary or equity interests,  payments exclusive of c linical trial costs) to 
allow complete disclosure to regulatory auth orities. The investigator shall promptly update 
this information if any relevant changes occur during the course of the investigation and for a 
period of 1 year following study completion. 
10.10 Publication Policy 
This study is being conducted as part of a multi -center clinical study. Data from all sites 
participating in the multi-center clinical study will be pooled and analyzed. The investigator 
acknowledges that an independent, joint publica tion is anticipated to be authored by the 
investigators of the multi-center study and spons or’s representatives. Neither institution nor 
principal investigator shall inde pendently publish or present the results of the study prior to 
the publication of the mu lti-center study publication. The inves tigator agrees th at the sponsor 
will be the coordinator and arb itrator of all multi-center stud y publications. For multi-center 
trials, no investigator will be authorized to publish study results from an individual center 
until the earlier of the multi-center  trial results are published or 12 months after the end or 
termination of the multi-center trial at all sites. 
The investigator shall submit a copy of any proposed publication, manuscript, abstract, 
presentation or other document with respect to this study to the sponsor for review and 
comment at least 60 days prior to its subm ission for publication or presentation. No 
publication or presentation with respect to th e study shall be made unless and until the entire 
sponsor’s comments on the proposed publication or presentation have been considered and 
any information determined by sponsor to be confidential information has been removed.

Protocol HGS1012-C1103 Amendment 01  Mapatumumab 
 
 If requested in writing by the sponsor, the investigator shall withhold material from 
submission for publication or presen tation for an additional 60 days  to allow for the filing of a 
patent application or the taking of other meas ures to establish and preserve the sponsor’s 
proprietary rights. 
10.11 Study or Study Site Termination 
If Human Genome Sciences, the investigator, IRB/IEC, or a regulatory authority discovers 
conditions arising during the study  that indicate that the study should be halted or that the 
study center should be terminated, this action may be taken after appropriate consultation between Human Genome Sciences and the investigator. Conditions that may warrant termination of the study include, but are not limited to, the following: 
• The discovery of an unexpected, serious, or unac ceptable risk to the subjects enrolled in 
the study. 
• A decision on the part of Human Genome Sciences to suspend or discontinue testing, 
evaluation, or development of the product. 
 
The study site may warrant termination under the following conditions: 
• Failure of the investigator to enroll su bjects into the study at an acceptable rate. 
• Failure of the investigator to comply with pertinent regulatory authority regulations. 
• Submission of knowingly false information from  the research facility to Human Genome 
Sciences, study monitor, or  the regulatory authority. 
• Insufficient adherence to protocol requirements.

 Appendix 5 Modified Re sponse Evaluation Criter ia in Hepatocellular 
Carcinoma (mRE CIST for HCC) 
(Adapted from Lencioni and Llove t, 2010 for use in this study) 
Measurable disease:  The presence of at least 1 target lesion, by contrast enhanced 
computerized tomography (CT) with use of mu ltislice scanners, or cont rast enhanced dynamic 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). 
Target lesion: Meets all the following criteria: 
- Located in the liver. 
- Can be accurately measured in at least 1 dimension. 
- Well-delineated area of viable, hypervascular (contrast enhancem ent in the arterial phase) 
tumor that is > 2 cm in the axial plane. 
- Suitable for repeat measurement. 
- Not previously treated with locoregional or systemic treatment unless the lesion shows a 
well-delineated area of viable (c ontrast enhancement in the arterial phase) tumor that is 
> 2 cm in the axial plane. (If the lesion is poorly demarcated or exhibits atypical enhancement as a result of the previous interven tion, then it cannot be selected as a target 
lesion). 
 A maximum of 5 target lesions may be selected. 
Nontarget lesion: Other lesions, including small lesions ( ≤ 2 cm in the axial plane). Note that 
malignant portal vein thrombosis should be considered a nonmeasurable, and therefore 
nontarget, lesion. Lymph nodes at the portal hepa tic can be considered as malignant if the 
lymph node short axis is at leas t 2 cm. Selection of effusion, in cluding ascities, as a nontarget 
lesion is prohibited. Similarly, bone lesions or any ot her lesion outside the CT or MRI of the 
abdomen or obtained by other modality, ma y not be selected as nontarget lesions.  
Measurement of lesions:  Imaging studies will be by contrast enhanced CT, with use of 
multislice scanners, or contrast enhanced MRI. The same method mu st be used at baseline and 
during follow up. Note that the longest diameter of the viable tumor is not necessarily located in the same scan plane in which the baseline diameter was measured. The measurement of the 
viable tumor diameter should not include any major intervening areas of necrosis. (Please see the HGS1012-C1103 Radiographic Data Collection Manual). 
Evaluation of target lesions: 
Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of intrat umoral arterial enhancement in all target 
lesions. 
Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of viable 
(enhancement in the arterial phase) target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of the diameters of target lesions. AM01 
21Dec10 
Human Genome Sciences, Inc. Confidential Page 64 
Protocol HGS1012-C1103 Amendment 01  Mapatumumab 
 
 Stable Disease (SD): Any cases that  do not qualify for CR, PR or PD. 
Progressive Disease (PD): An incr ease of at least 20% in the su m of the diameters of viable 
(enhancing) target lesions, taking as referen ce the smallest sum of the diameters of viable 
(enhancing) target lesions reco rded since treatment started. 
Evaluation of nontarget lesions:  
Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of intratumoral arterial enhancement. 
Incomplete Response/Stable Disease (IR/SD):  Persistence of intratumoral arterial 
enhancement in 1 or more nontarget lesions. Progressive Disease (PD): Unequivocal prog ression of existing nontarget lesions.   
Evaluation of new lesions: A newly detected hepatic nodule will be classified as evidence of 
progression when its longest diameter is ≥ 1 cm and the nodule shows the 
hypervascularization in the arteri al phase with washout in the portal venous or late venous 
phase.   Liver lesions ≥ 1 cm that do not show a typical vascul ar pattern can be diagnosed as HCC by 
evidence of at least a 1 cm-interval growth in subsequent scans.  An individual radiologic event will be adjudicated in retrospect as progression at the time it 
was 1st detected  by imaging techniques, even if strict criteria were fulfilled only on subsequent 
radiologic testing. Images by another modality may be obtained, as clinically indicated post-baseline. Sites may 
conclude that post-baseline images based on a nother modality that indicate disease are 
evidence of radiologic progression if: (1) there was no imaging done at baseline; (2) if there 
was imaging done at baseline showing no disease present at that time; or (3) if there was 
imagine done at baseline indicating that the on-treatment assessment represents unequivocal 
worsening. In these cases the disease will be reported as ‘new lesions’. 
All images obtained on study will be provided the BICR for the independent efficacy read, or 
for confirmation of progression if required or requested. 
Evaluation of Overall Response: The overall response is determined at each assessment and 
is a result of the combined assessment of ta rget lesions, nontarget le sions and new lesions.

Best Overall Response : 
The best overall response is the best respons e recorded from the start of treatment until 
disease progression. To be as signed a best overall response of  CR or PR, changes in tumor 
measurements must be confirmed at the next scheduled disease assessment (no fewer than 
4 weeks after the initial documentation of PR or CR).

 Appendix 6 Exploratory Biomarker Sub-study 
1. Background 
Mapatumumab is a targeted therapy. Presently , the relationship between  expression of the 
target, TRAIL-R1, and the anti-tumor activity of the antibody is incompletely understood. 
Studies conducted with cell li nes derived from human tumors  have suggested that the 
relationship between receptor expression and mapatumumab-induced tumor cell death may be 
complex. However, studies of human tumor cells  in vitro and transplanted into animals may 
not accurately reflect the relationship between receptor expression and response to 
mapatumumab that may be observed in patients with cancer. One feature of this biomarker 
study is to compare TRAIL-R1 e xpression from available biopsy material. This could allow 
for a greater understanding of patterns of TRAIL-R1 expression in advanced hepatocellular 
carcinoma. 
It is also likely that other factors involved in TRAIL-R1 si gnaling could critically affect 
response to mapatumumab treatment. A 2nd goal of this biomarke r study is to evaluate 
biomarkers that may be potential indicators or  modifiers of response to mapatumumab. To 
identify factors that may indicate that a pa tient is responding to treatment, serum-based 
markers will be compared before and after treatment. To explore factors that are associated 
with the outcome of therapy and could be used prior to treatment to predict which patients will respond, somatic (inherited) differences th at modify a patient’s drug response will be 
examined. 
The information generated from this sub-study will be used solely for research purposes to 
improve future treatment with mapatumumab. It will not be used to change diagnoses or alter therapy. Participation in this sub-study is optional. 
2. Study Objectives and Design 
2.1. Indicators of Response 2.1.1. Serum-Based Markers of Response 
Induction of cell death in tumor cells can elicit the release of  certain biomarkers into the 
serum. These markers can be quantified to eval uate treatment effect. To assess release of 
biomarkers associated with cell death, serum- based assays will be conducted, including, but 
not limited to, assessments of M30, a fragment  of cytokeratin 18 that is generated by 
induction of programmed cell death in epithelial tissues. Other examples of markers of tumor 
cell death that will be examined include the cytokines TRAIL, TNF α, soluble Fas ligand, 
interferon α, interferon γ, interleukin-2, interleukin-6, in terleukin-8, interleukin-10, and 
interleukin-12. The levels of these factors will be  examined before and after treatment to see if 
they correlate with response to treatment. 
Serum will be isolated and the level of cytokines and other markers like M30 will be 
characterized. Collection, processing and ha ndling of these samples are described in the 
laboratory manual. 
Human Genome Sciences, Inc. Confidential Page 67 
Protocol HGS1012-C1103 Amendment 01  Mapatumumab 
 
 Samples collected in this study will be stored for up to 15 years and may be analyzed with 
samples collected in other studies, but will only  be used for mapatumumab-related research. 
2.2. Modifiers of Response 
2.2.1. Neoplastic Modifiers of Response 
Historically collected tumor biops y material, if available, will  be collected from subjects 
during Cycle 1. Samples will also be obtaine d from subjects who undergo a biopsy during the 
treatment period. Samples of resected tumor ti ssue that has been formalin-fixed and embedded 
in paraffin is acceptable; either tissue blocks or  slides may be provided. Frozen samples of 
tumor tissue may also be provided. Biopsy materi al collected from fine needle aspirates may 
be provided; either cell pellets or cytological slides are acceptable. 
Levels of TRAIL receptors will be assessed in biopsy material using immunohistochemical 
techniques if samples are available as form alin-fixed/paraffin-embedded tissue blocks or 
slides. Historically obtained biopsy material or biopsy material obtai ned during the treatment 
period that is in the form of fresh frozen tissue or cell pellet samples will be utilized to isolate 
RNA for analysis of TRAIL receptor gene expression. Similar techniques will be used to evaluate other potential biomarkers and factors that may 
influence mapatumumab response. These may in clude but are not limited to caspase 8, AKT 
and Mcl-1. 
See the laboratory manual for collection, processing and handling of these samples. 
Samples collected in this study will be stored for up to 15 years and may be analyzed with 
samples collected in other studies, but will only  be used for mapatumumab-related research. 
2.2.2. Somatic Modifiers of Response 
Inherited differences in the genes that code  for drug targets or components of signaling 
pathways related to the target can dramatically influence the effect of pharmacotherapy. 
Variations in genes that could potentially  impact mapatumumab’s activity, including 
polymorphic changes in the Fc gamma receptor and interleukin-6 promoter and K-Ras gene mutations, will be examined to see if they correlate with response to treatment. 
DNA will be isolated from the blood and polymorphisms and mutations in specific 
response-related genes will be characterized. Collection, pro cessing and handling of these 
samples are described in the laboratory manual. Samples collected in this study will be stored for up to 15 years and may be analyzed with 
samples collected in other studies, but will only  be used for mapatumumab-related research.

 3. Statistical Analysis 
Associations will be assessed between candidate biomarkers and treatment outcomes captured 
in the clinical database. Statistical tests to  be performed may include Pearson chi-square 
testing, Fisher’s exact test, ANOVA and ANCO VA. Results of the biomarker sub-study may 
be reported independent of the results of HGS1012-C1103. 
4. Subject Selection and Withdrawal 
Subjects enrolled in the HGS1012-C1103 research study are given the option to participate in 
the Biomarkers Sub-study. A subject may withdraw from the sub-study at any time by contacting their Study Investigator, who will co ntact the sponsor. The sponsor will destroy 
any remaining sample materials an d will send a letter back to  the Investigator confirming 
sample destruction. Any data or  analysis generated from the sa mple prior to the request for 
destruction will not be destroyed. However, no new information will be generated from the 
sample and no new analysis will be performed. 
5. Confidentiality 
Information about sub-study subjects will be kept confidential and managed according to the 
requirements of local privacy regulations. Information obtained from samples will not be 
returned to subjects and will not be pl aced in the subject’s medical record. 
6. Ethical Considerations 
All subjects enrolled in the HGS1012-C1103 resear ch study who agree to participate in the 
Biomarker Sub-study will be asked to sign a se parate Biomarker Informed Consent. Choosing 
to not participate in this sub-study will not affect  the subject’s ability to participate in the main 
clinical trial. The Biomarker Informed C onsent will be submitted along with the main 
research study informed consent for review by the Institutional Review Board/Ethical 
Committee. 
7. Publication of Biomarker Results 
Any significant findings, based upon the analysis of aggregate data collected from this 
sub-study may be published by Human Genome Sc iences. Personal identifiers will not be 
used in any publication resu lting from this sub-study.

 Appendix 8 Treatment of Allerg ic/Hypersensitivity Reactions 
In the event of allergic/hypersensitivity reacti ons to mapatumumab/placeb o, investigators will 
institute treatment measures according to best  medical and nursing practice. The grading is 
based upon the NCI-CTCAE Version 4.0.0. 
The following treatment guidelines will be employed: 
• If chills and fever occur, the infusion w ill be interrupted. Subjects may be treated 
symptomatically and the infusion will be restarted at 50% of the original rate. 
 
Grade 1 allergic/hyper sensitivity reaction  (transient flushing or rash, drug fever < 38°C): 
• Decrease infusion rate by 50% and monitor for worsening condition. If the reaction 
worsens, stop the infusion. 
 Grade 2 allergic/hypersensitivity reaction  (rash, flushing, urticaria, dyspnea, drug fever 
< 38°C): 
• Stop the infusion. 
• Administer bronchodilators, oxygen, acetam inophen, etc as medically indicated. 
• Resume infusion at 50% of previous rate once reaction has decreased to ≤ Grade 1 in 
severity. Monitor closely for any worsening.  If the reaction recu rs, stop the infusion. 
 Re-treatment following Grade 1 or Grad e 2 allergic/hypersensitivity reactions: 
• Once the infusion rate has been decreased due to  an allergic/hypersensi tivity reaction, it 
will remain decreased for all subsequent infusions.  
• If the subject has a 2nd reaction at the lower infusion ra te, the infusion will be stopped and 
the subject will receive no further tr eatment with mapatumumab/placebo. 
• If the subject experiences a Grade 3 or Grad e 4 allergic/hypersensiti vity reaction at any 
time, the subject will receive no furthe r treatment with mapatumumab/placebo. 
• If there are questions concerning wh ether an observed reaction is an 
allergic/hypersensitivity of Grades 1-4, the medical monitor will be contacted immediately to assist with grading the reaction.  
 Grade 3 or Grade 4 allergic /hypersensitivity reaction: 
• A Grade 3 hypersensitivity reaction consis ts of symptomatic bronchospasm requiring 
parenteral medications with or without urticaria, allergy-related edema/angioedema, or 
asymptomatic hypotension not requiring treatment. 
• A Grade 4 hypersensitivity reaction (ie, anaphylaxis) is a life-threatening event 
characterized by the same symptoms as in a Grade 3 reaction but also complicated by 
symptomatic hypotension or oxygen saturation of 90% or less.

 Treatment of Grade 3 or Grade 4 allergic/hypersensitivity reaction: 
• Stop the infusion immediately and disconnect infusion tubing from the subject. 
• Administer epinephrine, bronc hodilators, antihistamines, glucocorticoids, intravenous 
fluids, vasopressor agents, oxygen, etc, as medically indicated.

randomly assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups in a 1:1 ratio to receive 30 mg/kg mapatumumab or placebo. 
Randomization will be stratified according to BCLC advanced stage C vs BCLC intermediate 
stage B and ECOG performance status (0 vs 1, 2).  Approximately 100 advanced HCC subject s will be randomized/enrolled.   
Human Genome Sciences, Inc. Confidential Page 6 
Protocol HGS1012-C1103 Amendment 00  Mapatumumab 
 
Study Treatment: 
Mapatumumab will be supplied in open labe l vials and third party unblinding will be 
employed. The study agent will be reconstituted by the unblinded site pharmacist or unblinded 
designee. The unblinded site pharmacist or un blinded designee will also be the person 
responsible for receiving and dispensing study  agent but independent of all other study 
activities. All other study personnel, the subject, the Sponsor will remain blinded to the study 
agent received. Separate monitors will be responsible for the clinical (blinded monitor) and study agent (unblinded monito r) aspects of the study. 
Subjects will receive treatment every 21 days (ie, a cycle) as outlined below: 
Arm A:  Sorafenib 400 mg orally twice da ily continuously in each cycle + placebo 
intravenously on Day 1 of each cycle. 
Arm B: Sorafenib 400 mg orally twice daily  continuously + mapatumumab (30 mg/kg) 
intravenously on Day 1 of each cycle. 
Subjects will continue to receive study treatment (s) until radiologic di sease progression or 
unacceptable toxicity. Subjects unable to tole rate sorafenib may continue to receive 
mapatumumab/placebo every 21 days until ra diographic progression. Subjects unable to 
tolerate mapatumumab/placebo may continue to receive sorafenib until radiographic 
progression. All subjects will have an end of treatment visit at least 30 days after the last dose of sorafenib and/or mapatumumab/placebo whichever is later. Af ter discontinuation of 
treatment, subjects will continue to be fo llowed for radiologic disease assessments every 
6 weeks, starting 6 weeks after the previous disease assessment while on treatment, until 
documented radiologic disease progression (if not previously documented) and then every 
3 months thereafter for survival until at least 90% of the subjects have met the survival endpoint. 
Disease Assessments: Radiologic disease assessments along with assessm ent of alpha fetoprotein will be performed 
at the end of every two 21-day cycles (ie, Cycles  2, 4, 6 and every 2 cycles thereafter). The 
disease assessment will be performed and documented no earlier than 5 days before the start 
of the next cycle. Clinical responses will be evaluated according to mRECIST for HCC (see 
Section 6.7 and Appendix 5). The same assessment method will be used throughout the study 
for each subject. If disease progression is base d only on new lesions or is equivocal, images 
will be provided to the blinded, independent, central reader (BICR) for confirmation of disease progression. Partial response (PR) and complete response (CR) will be confirmed at 
the next scheduled disease assessment (no fewer than 4 weeks after the initial documentation of PR or CR). All imaging scans used for disease assessments will be made available for independent radiology review by the Sponsor or designee. 
Human Genome Sciences, Inc. Confidential Page 7 
Protocol HGS1012-C1103 Amendment 00  Mapatumumab 
 
Safety Assessments: 
The safety of sorafenib and mapatumumab wi ll be assessed by evaluation of the type, 
frequency, and severity of adverse events (ie, according to the NCI-CTCAE Version 4.0 
grading) and changes in clinic al laboratory tests (hematology and clinical chemistry) and 
immunogenicity over time. In the event that an  adverse event does not have an NCI-CTCAE 
Version 4.0 grading, the se verity grades in Section 8.6 will be used. Adverse events (including 
serious adverse events) will be captured from the start of study agent administration (sorafenib 
and/or mapatumumab/placebo) through at least 30 days following the last dose of sorafenib 
and/or mapatumumab/placebo, whichever is late r. Laboratory assessments will be performed 
at screening, and during each study visit outl ined in the study calendar found in Section 6.3. 
The Human Genome Sciences Re view Committeee (HGSRC) is co mprised of the Department 
Heads of Biostatistics, Regulatory Affairs and Drug Development. The HGSRC will review safety data after: (1) 10 subjects have comple ted 1 cycle; and (2) 30 subjects have completed 
1 cycle. HGSRC reviews of safety data w ill be conducted approximately every 4 months 
thereafter, until 90% of subjects have reached radiologic progression. The HGSRC may 
conduct additional reviews at thei r own request and/or at the re quest of the Medical Monitor. 
The HGSRC may request the un blinding of treatment assignment for a subject and/or 
treatment groups. If treatment assignments are unblinded, the rationale for the unblinding will 
be documented. 
Immunogenicity: Blood samples for serum antibodies to mapatumumab will be obtained as outlined in  
Table 6-1 . 
Dose Modification/Delay: 
Dose modifications will not be allowed for mapatumumab/placebo. Dose modifications of 
sorafenib for toxicity will be made according to the guidelines provided in the treatment 
section (Section 5.2.3) of the protocol. 
Details regarding pre-treatment and manageme nt of hypersensitivity reactions related to 
mapatumumab are provided in Section 5.1.5 and Appendix 8. 
Pharmacokinetics: 
Multiple blood specimens will be obtained from subjects for serum mapatumumab 
concentration determinations as outlined in Table 6-1 . 
Pharmacodynamics: 
Subjects will be given the optio n to participate in a biomarke r research sub-study. Consenting 
subjects will be asked to provide a historic ally obtained biopsy samp le, if available, and 
several blood samples. In addition, samples will be requested from subjects who undergo a 
biopsy during the treatment period. 
Human Genome Sciences, Inc. Confidential Page 8 
Protocol HGS1012-C1103 Amendment 00  Mapatumumab 
 
To examine biomarkers present peripherally, blood will be drawn during Cycles 1 and 2, from 
which DNA and serum proteins will be isolat ed. The biomarker sub-study is detailed in 
Appendix 6. 
Exploratory Assessments: Blood samples will be collected for quantification of B and T lymphocyte subsets on Day 1 
(prior to dosing) and Day 15 of Cycles 1 and 2. 
Study Endpoints: The following will be evaluated (these endpoints and the respective analyses are defined in 
Section 9): 
Primary: 
• Time to progression (TTP). 
 Secondary: 
• Overall survival. 
• Progression-free survival. 
• Objective response (complete response  [CR] + partial response [PR]). 
• Disease control (CR + PR + stable disease [SD]). 
• Response duration and time to response in responders. 
• Frequency and severity of treat ment-emergent adverse events. 
• Laboratory parameters. 
• Serum mapatumumab concentrations for use in a population pharmacokinetic analysis. 
 Statistical Methods: 
Sample Size: A total of approximately 100 subjects will be randomly assigned to 1 of 2 arms and treated 
with either sorafenib + placebo or the 2-agent combination of sorafenib and mapatumumab at 30 mg/kg in a 1:1 ratio. A sample size of 50 subjects randomized and treated in each group is sufficient to estimate the median time to progre ssion with a precision of approximately -1.9 M 
to +2.6 M relative to the observed median. In  addition, a sample size of 50 patients per arm 
will provide 80% power to detect an improveme nt in TTP from 5.5 to 8.9 M with at a 
one-sided significance level of 0.10. 
Statistical Analysis: The primary analysis will be an estimate of  median time to progression in each arm 
using Kaplan Meier methods, reported with 95% confidence intervals, along with logrank 
testing for a difference between treatment groups controlling for factors stratifying the 
Human Genome Sciences, Inc. Confidential Page 9 
Protocol HGS1012-C1103 Amendment 00  Mapatumumab 
 
randomization. Secondary analyses include estimates, using Kaplan Meier methods, of 
median progression-free surviv al (PFS) and median overall survival (OS) along with 
associated logrank testing. In  addition, estimates of overall  response rate (CR+PR) and 
disease control rate (CR+PR+SD) will be reported with 95% confidence intervals and an 
estimate of the difference in response rates and disease control rates between groups will be reported and tested for significance with a Pearson chi-square test (or Fisher’s exact test). For 
frequency and severity of adverse events and la boratory toxicity grading, counts and rates will 
be presented. 
Study Calendar: The study calendar is located in Section 6.3 of the protocol.

1 Background 
1.1 Hepatocellular Carcinoma 
Hepatocellular carcinoma is the 5th most common cancer worldwide accounting for 2% of all 
malignancies. It is the 3rd leading cause of cancer-related death globally with 1 million new 
cases a year (WHO, 2007; IACR, 2002; Fe rlay et al, 2004; Lopez et al, 2006). 
Hepatocellular carcinoma is more prevalent in ma les with a male:female ratio as high as 8:1. 
Depending on the endemic risk factors, hepato cellular carcinoma is diagnosed during the 
4th through 6th decades of life. The reported incide nce of  hepatocellular carcinoma is 
increasing because of a better ability to diagnose the diseas e and because of the long-term 
consequences of hepatitis C virus (HCV) and he patitis B virus (HBV) infection (Reis et al, 
2006). Worldwide the most common cause of hepatocellular carcinoma is chronic HBV 
infection (El-Serag et al, 2003). Endemic ar eas thus include China, South Asia and 
South Africa where the incidence of hepatocellu lar carcinoma can be as high as 120 cases 
per 100,000. In the United States, where HCV and alcohol are the main risk factors, 
the age-adjusted incidence rates have incr eased from 1.4 cases per 100,000 in 1980 to a 
current incidence of 4 cases per 100,000. Th is equates to about 8500-11,000 new cases 
diagnosed each year (IACR, 2002; Ferlay et al, 2004; Pawlik et al, 2004 ; Edwards, et al, 2005; 
Jemal et al, 2007; Bosch et al, 2004). 
1.2 Treatment Options for Patient s with Hepatocellular Carcinoma 
Surgery, including transplantation, is the only curative modality for hepatocellular carcinoma 
(Venook, 1994; Cha et al, 2003). The 5-year surv ival rate for patients with unresectable 
hepatocellular carcinoma is 11% in the US (ACS, 2007), < 8% in Europe (Capocaccia et al, 
2007), and < 10% in Asia (Teo and Fock, 2001). Symptomatic hepatocellular carcinoma has a 
very poor prognosis with a median survival of  1–8 months (Former et al, 2006; Llovet et al, 
1999a, b). 
Sorafenib, a multikinase inhibitor, is the 1st systemic therapy to significantly impact survival 
in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma, as demonstrated in an international, 
multicenter Phase 3, placebo-controlled trial (L lovet et al, 2007). Sora fenib was approved in 
the United States and European Union for the 1st-line treatment of advanced hepatocellular 
carcinoma in late 2007 and th e 2008 National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines 
have been updated with the addition of sorafe nib as a treatment option for hepatocellular 
carcinoma patients. The updated Barcelona C linic Liver Cancer (BCLC) guidelines 
recommend sorafenib for hepatocellular carcinoma patients with BCLC Advanced Stage (C) (Forner et al, 2010). 
1.3 The Role of the TRAIL Pathway in HCC 
1.3.1 TRAIL and TRAIL Receptors 
TRAIL is a member of the tumor necrosis f actor (TNF) ligand superf amily, with homology 
to Fas/Apo1 ligand (Pitti et al, 1996; W iley et al, 1995). TRAIL induces programmed 
cell death primarily in tumor cells through activation of TRAIL death receptors, TRAIL-R1 
(death receptor 4) or TRAIL-R2 (death receptor 5) (Ashkenazi et al, 1999; Evdokiou et al, 
Human Genome Sciences, Inc. Confidential Page 17 
Protocol HGS1012-C1103 Amendment 00  Mapatumumab 
 
2002; Kothny-Wilkes et al, 1998; Lawrence et al , 2001; Pitti et al, 1996; Walczak et al, 1999; 
Wiley et al, 1995). 
TRAIL-R1, the target of mapatumumab, is detect able on tumor cells derived from colon, lung, 
liver, gastric, pancreas, uterus and esophagus and in tissue sections from various tumors of the 
colon, lung, pancreas, liver and stomach without significant expression in parallel normal 
tissues (Halpern et al, 2004; Roach et al, 2004). 
1.3.2 TRAIL and HBV/HCV Infection 
Acutely infected tissues, including the liver, ut ilize the TRAIL pathway to eliminate virally 
and bacterially infected cells (Herr et al, 20 07). In viral hepatitis, TRAIL and 1 of its 
receptors, TRAIL-R2, are upregulated and cont ribute to the elimination of infected 
hepatocytes associated with viral hepatitis (B antel and Schulze-Osthoff, 2003; Lin et al, 2002; 
Matsuda et al, 2005). In addition to HBV and HCV infection, steat osis, exposure to bile acids 
and chronic alcohol exposure induce increase d expression of TRAIL and TRAIL-R2, but not 
TRAIL-R1, in human hepatocytes (Dunn et al, 2007; Mundt et al, 2005). Cell surface 
expression of TRAIL-R2, but not TRAIL-R1, was altered and responsible for sensitization to 
TRAIL in hepatocytes exposed to  bile acids (Higuchi et al, 2001; Malhi et al, 2007). These 
findings have been reproduced in preclinical models. Non-virally infected hepatocytes are 
refractory to TRAIL and TRAIL- R agonists but exposure of HC V-infected hepatocytes to 
TRAIL leads to a significant level of apoptosis  (Volkmann  et al, 2007). Inhibition of the 
TRAIL pathway may protect infected cells from  apoptosis and allow for chronic infection 
(Mundt et al, 2003). Recent non-clinical observations  demonstrated that natural killer cells 
expressing the ligand TRAIL, are enriched in the livers of patients with chronic HBV 
infection, and TRAIL is overexpr essed in the livers of patients with HCV-associated steatosis 
(Mundt et al, 2005).  
In summary, preclinical data suggest that mapatumumab may promote apoptosis of cancer 
cells, including hepatocellular carcinoma cells. Whether viral infectio n, including HBV or 
HCV infection, will attenuate or  modulate the effects of mapatumumab on hepatocytes is not 
yet known, but experience to date in a Phase 1b trial of mapatumumab in combination with 
sorafenib in subjects with advanced hepatoce llular carcinoma who are positive for hepatitis B 
surface antigen or hepatitis C antibody indicates that the safety experience is consistent with 
underlying disease and known sora fenib toxicities (see Section 1.2). 
1.4 Mapatumumab 
1.4.1 Mapatumumab Pharmacology 
Mapatumumab is a fully human, agonist monoc lonal antibody that activ ates the cell death 
pathway in tumor cells by specifically binding to TRAIL-R1 with high affinity. 
Mapatumumab efficiently induces apoptosis in human cancer cell lines expressing the 
TRAIL-R1 protein on the cell surface. Nonc linical studies have demonstrated that 
mapatumumab can induce cytotoxicity in multiple  tumor cell lines representing both solid and 
hematological malignancies, including cancers of the biliary tract, colon, lung, breast, pancreas, esophagus, ovary, kidney, uterus, as  well as lymphoma and various leukemias. 
Mapatumumab has also demonstrated anti-tum or activity as a single agent, preventing 
Human Genome Sciences, Inc. Confidential Page 18 
Protocol HGS1012-C1103 Amendment 00  Mapatumumab 
 
tumor growth and in some cases causing regres sion of tumors in xenograft tumor models of 
multiple human malignancies, including lung, colon, kidney, and uterus (Camidge, 2007; 
Georgakis et al, 2005; Jin et al, 2007; Humphr eys, 2004; Marini et al, 2006; Menoret et al, 
2006; Pukac et al, 2005). 
The relationship between receptor expression and response to therapy with mapatumumab 
remains unclear. In vitro studies of cell lines have shown that TRAIL-R1 expression level is 
not a consistent predictor of response to ma patumumab. Although both TRAIL-R1 expression 
and apoptosis in response to mapatumumab are increased in many tumor cell lines as 
compared with normal diploid cells, there are examples of mapatumumab cytotoxicity on cell 
lines with very low levels of detectable receptor, and conversely, mapatumumab resistant cell lines that have relatively high levels of TRAIL-R1 cell surface expression. 
Tumor cell cytotoxic activity can be enhanced  when mapatumumab is administered in 
combination with chemotherapeutics or other anti-neoplastic agents. Enhanced apoptotic 
signaling, in vitro cell killing and in vivo anti-tumor activity have been observed when mapatumumab has been combined with various types of therapeutic agents and treatments including microtubule poisons, anti metabolites,  topoisomerase inhi bitors, proteosome 
inhibitors, platinum agents and radiation. Both the level and spectrum of activity of 
mapatumumab is enhanced in in vitro cyto toxicity and in vivo xenograft studies in 
combination with various chemotherapeutic and anti-neoplastic agents, including a xenograft model of hepatocellular carcinoma in combination with cisplatin and gemcitabine (Camidge, 2007; Pukac et al, 2005; Georgakis et al, 2005; Humphreys, 2004; Jin et al, 2007; 
Human Genome Sciences data on file). 
Please refer to the mapatumumab Investigator’s  Brochure for detailed information regarding 
the nonclinical pharmacology, toxicology, and PK of mapatumumab. 
1.4.2 Non-Clinical Mapatumumab Safety Studies 
To assess the nonclinical safety of mapatumuma b, a 6-month toxicity study, with a 4-month 
recovery period, was conducted in chimpanzees. Mapatumumab was administered 
intravenously at up to 40 mg/kg every 10 days. No mapatumumab-specific toxicity was identified and no anti-mapatumum ab antibodies were detected. 
To assess its off-target effects, mapatumumab was administered intravenously weekly to cynomolgus monkeys, whose TRAIL R1 homolog does not bind mapatumumab. Mapatumumab was well tolerated at doses  of up to 50 mg/kg and was not highly 
immunogenic: of the 40 monkeys treated, 1 developed anti-mapatumumab antibodies. The 
positive response was observed in an anim al in the high dose (50 mg/kg) group. 
In vitro, mapatumumab was found to decrease  viability of normal human hepatocytes, 
although the observed effect was less than that ob served with TRAIL. This  effect was variable 
across donors and did not amplify with increasi ng concentrations of mapatumumab. It should 
be noted that in clinical studies, plasma mapatu mumab concentrations have been achieved that 
are > 1100–fold greater than the minimum exposure  resulting in reduced in vitro hepatocyte 
viability. Despite this, the clinical results do no t reveal evidence of hepatotoxicity in those 
Human Genome Sciences, Inc. Confidential Page 19 
Protocol HGS1012-C1103 Amendment 00  Mapatumumab 
 
studies. Hence it appears that the in vitro hepatocyte viability assay is not predictive of 
mapatumumab effects in vivo. 
1.4.3 Clinical Experience with Mapatumumab 
Over 400 subjects have received mapatumumab in c linical trials to date. Preliminary clinical 
data are available from 218 subjects who rece ived mapatumumab as a single agent at doses 
ranging from 0.01 to 20 mg/kg across 6 clinical trials. 
Based on available data, mapatumumab appears to  be well tolerated and no significant safety 
issues have been observed. Adverse events have generally been mild to moderate in severity, 
manageable, and do not appear rela ted to dose. The most frequently reported treatment-related 
adverse events occurring in > 10% of subjects were fatigue, hypotension, nausea and pyrexia. 
Severe events have been uncommon and generally judged not relate d to mapatumumab. 
Severe events judged at leas t possibly related to mapatumumab have been observed and a 
complete list can be found in the mapatumumab Investigator’s Brochure. Grade 3 or Grade 4 
hematologic, renal, or hepatic laboratory a bnormalities also have been relatively uncommon 
with no significant trend or dose-response evident. Lymph openia was the most commonly 
observed laboratory abnormality, but tended to be intermittent and reversible and was not associated with infectious events. 
In subjects with solid tumors, stable dise ase has been the best response observed with 
mapatumumab as a single-agent. However, 2 complete responses  (CRs) and 1 partial response 
(PR) were observed in subj ects with follicular lymphoma. 
In addition, preliminary clinical data ar e available from 234 subjects who received 
mapatumumab at doses ranging from 1 to 30 mg/kg every 21 days in combination with 
chemotherapy in 5 clinical tr ials (carboplatin/paclitaxel [N  = 100], gemcitabine/cisplatin 
[N = 49], bortezomib [n = 69], or sorafenib [n = 16]. Mapatumumab ha s been generally well 
tolerated; adverse events and laboratory abnormalities have been consistent with those expected with underlying disease or chemothera py. A listing of severe events considered at 
least possibly related to mapatumumab can be  found in the mapatumumab Investigator’s 
Brochure. The most commonly occurring labora tory abnormalities have been hematologic 
(ie, anemia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, a nd leukopenia), as expected  with chemotherapy. 
Grade 3/4 laboratory abnormalities have been relatively uncommon. Higher frequencies of 
Grade 3/4 neutropenia, leukopenia, lymphopenia, and thrombocytopenia have been observed. Data from randomized Phase 2 studies in co mbination with chemotherapy suggest that 
mapatumumab may increase rates of lymphopenia. 
One subject receiving mapatumumab in combination with carboplatin/paclitaxel has 
achieved a CR. Twenty-two subjects receiv ing mapatumumab in combination with 
paclitaxel/carboplatin and 12 subjects rece iving mapatumumab in combination with 
gemcitabine/cisplatin have achieved PRs. Three subjects receiving mapatumumab in 
combination with bortezomib achieved CRs; 25 subjects receiving mapatumumab in combination with bortezomib achieved a PR.

1.5 Rationale for the Evaluation of  Mapatumumab in Combination with 
Sorafenib in Hepato cellular Carcinoma 
Sorafenib is the standard of care for treatment of patients with advanced hepatocellular 
carcinoma. Sorafenib is a multikinase inhibitor that targets the Raf/mitogen-activated protein 
kinase/extracellular sign al-regulated kinase signaling pathwa y, blocks tumor angiogenesis and 
induces apoptosis (Panka et al, 2006; Rahmani  et al, 205; Yu et al, 2005; Wilhelm  et al, 
2004). Sorafenib was approved by the European Medicines Agency and the Food and Drug Administration in 2007 for treatment of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma based on the demonstration of improved overall survival in  the 602 patient randomized, placebo-controlled, 
Phase 3 “Sorafenib Hepatocellular Carcinom a Assessment Randomized Protocol” (SHARP) 
trial. Approximately half the 602 patients had either hepatitis C virus or hepatitis B virus as underlying etiology and 26% had al cohol-related cirrhosis. The median overall survival was 
10.7 months for patients in the sorafenib arm co mpared with 7.0 months for patients in the 
placebo arm (hazard ratio in the sorafenib group, 0.69 95% confid ence interval, 0.55 to 0.87; 
p < 0.001). The median time to radiologic progression was 5.5 months in the sorafenib arm, compared with 2.8 months in the placebo arm (p < 0.0001) (Llovet et al, 2008). Seven patients 
in the sorafenib group (2%) and 2 patients in  the placebo group (1%) had a PR; no patients 
had a CR. 
A 2
nd randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 3 trial wa s conducted in the Asia-Pacific region 
(Cheng et al, 2009). The 226 patients randomly assi gned to sorafenib or placebo in this trial 
appeared to have more advanced disease than those in the SHARP trial, with a higher 
frequency of extrahepatic spread , poorer ECOG PS, and higher leve ls of AFP, but still showed 
a benefit from treatment with sorafenib. The majority (73%) had hepatitis B virus as an underlying etiology. The median overall survival was 6.5 months for patients in the sorafenib 
arm, compared with 4.2 months in the pl acebo group (hazard ratio , 0.68, 95% confidence 
interval, 0.50-0.93; p = 0.014). The median ti me to progression was 2.8 months in the 
sorafenib group, compared with 1.4 months in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.57, 95% confidence interval 0.42-0.79; p = 0.0005). 
The mechanisms of sorafenib and mapatumumab action suggest that these agents could 
interact synergistically. Sorafenib sensitizes human cancer cell lines, including cell lines 
derived from hepatocellular carcinoma, to apoptotic stimuli by reducing expression of apoptotic regulatory proteins; Mcl-1, Bcl-xL, and FLIP (Kim et al,2008; Koehler et al, 2009; Rosato et al, 2007; Liu et al , 2006; Rahmani et al, 2005; Yu et al, 2005). Mcl-1, Bcl-xL 
and FLIP have also been shown to mediate sensitivity of a wide range of tumor cell lines to TRAIL receptor agonists (Meng  et al, 2007; Rosato et al, 2007; Llobet et al 2010; 
Blechacz et al, 2009; Katz et al, 2009; Huang and Sincrope, 2010; a nd Menoret et al, 2006). 
Recent studies demonstrated the combination of sorafenib with TRAIL or TRAIL receptor antibodies has significant activity  in hepatocellular carcinoma ce ll lines (Koehler et al, 2009) 
and colon tumor xenografts (Ricci et al, 2007) that were resistant to TRAIL and an antibody 
against TRAIL-R2. 
Mapatumumab activity has been evaluated precli nically in hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines 
by in vitro cytotoxicity assays  both as a single agent and in  combination with doxorubicin, 
cisplatin, gemcitabine or sorafenib. Single ag ent mapatumumab activity was observed in 4 of 
Human Genome Sciences, Inc. Confidential Page 21 
Protocol HGS1012-C1103 Amendment 00  Mapatumumab 
 
10 hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines. Increased in vitro cytotoxicity, including examples of 
synergy, were observed in 8 of 10 cell li nes when mapatumumab was combined with 
doxorubicin or cisplatin or the combination of cisplatin and gemcitabine (Humphreys et al, 
2008). Two of these hepatocellu lar carcinoma cell lines were evaluated for in vitro 
cytotoxicity of mapatumumab in combination with sorafenib. One displayed an increase in 
cytotoxicity from 30% to 60% when trea ted with a combination of sorafenib and 
mapatumumab. Importantly, treatment of a prim ary human hepatocyte cell line did not induce 
any apoptosis at doses of mapatumumab that were cytotoxic to hepato cellular carcinoma cell 
lines (  and  [personal communication], 2008; Abdulghani et al, 2008). 
Therefore, collectively, the expression of TRAIL-R1 in hepatocellular carcinoma and 
preclinical activity observed with combinati ons of mapatumumab with chemotherapy or 
sorafenib supports the rationale that this combination may be able to effectively target 
hepatocellular carcinoma. 
1.6 Rationale for Dose Selection 
As of June 2010, mapatumumab has been administered with chemotherapy (ie, carboplatin/paclitaxel, gemc itabine/cisplatin, bortezomib, or sorafenib) to 234 subjects, 
including 61 subjects who received 20 mg/ kg and 50 subjects who received 30 mg/kg 
mapatumumab. Based on available data, mapatumumab in combination with chemotherapy is generally well tolerated at dose levels up to a nd including 30 mg/kg, a nd no significant safety 
issues have been observed in the course of the clinical trials even at the higher doses.   
Preliminary PK data are available for subjects who received 1, 10, 20 or 30 mg/kg mapatumumab in combination with gemcitabine  and cisplatin (n = 49), 10 or 30 mg/kg 
mapatumumab in combination with paclitaxel  and carboplatin (n = 73), and 3, 10, or 
30 mg/kg mapatumumab in combination with sorafenib (n = 17). Serum or plasma mapatumumab concentrations are consistently within the range of expected concentrations predicted from Phase 1 study results in solid tumor patients administered mapatumumab as 
monotherapy. Mapatumumab PK is linear and not  affected by the addition of therapeutic 
agents. As expected, the observed peak and tr ough levels of mapatumumab at 30 mg/kg are 
2 to 3 times higher than those observed at 10 mg/kg. Exposure appears to increase in proportion to dose and exposures for a gi ven dose are similar across studies.  
A Phase 1b dose escalation study of mapatumumab in combination with sorafenib in subjects with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma who are positive for hepatitis  B surface antigen or 
hepatitis C antibody is being condu cted. Safety observations have  been consistent with the 
underlying disease and known sorafe nib toxicities. As of June 2010, 6 subjects have received 
3 mg/kg, 9 subjects have received 10 mg/ kg, and 1 subject has received 30 mg/kg 
mapatumumab. The number of cycles completed ranges from 1 to 20; 4/16 (25.0%) of subjects have completed 11 or more cycles. Ad verse events have generally been consistent 
with published reports of the toxicities associated with sorafenib and prev ious experience 
with mapatumumab, as well as underlying disease. The most frequently occurring 
treatment-emergent adverse events, regardless  of severity or attr ibution of causality, 
include diarrhea (10/16, 62.5%), fatigue (9/16, 56.3%), nausea (9/16, 56.3%), and vomiting (7/16, 43.8%). Serious adverse events, regardless of attribution of causality, include 
hypertension, upper respiratory tract infection, atrial fibr illation, hyperbilirubinemia, 
PPD

Protocol HGS1012-C1103 Amendment 00  Mapatumumab 
 
hypoglycemia, and hepatic pain. Severe adverse even ts considered at leas t possibly related to 
mapatumumab or its interaction w ith sorafenib include elevated lipase (3/16, 18.8%), hepatic 
pain (1/16, 6.3%), and thrombocytopenia (1/16, 6.3%). Laboratory abnormalities have 
generally been mild or moderate in severity, manageable, and/or consistent with those expected with chemotherapy or the underlying di sease. The most frequent Grade 3 or Grade 4 
laboratory abnormalities include elevated total bilirubin (Grade 3, 4/16, 25.0%; Grade 4, 
1/16, 6.3%) and lymphopenia (Grade 3, 3/16,  18.8%; Grade 4, 2/16, 12.5%). Additional 
information on the safety experience can be found in the mapatumumab Investigators’ Brochure. 
Based on the information currently available, the safety profile continues to be favorable, 
supporting continued evaluati on of mapatumumab in combination with chemotherapy, 
including sorafenib. The maximum tolerated dose has not been reached in any of the Phase 1 or Phase 2 trials conducted to date. Thus , further evaluation of the 30 mg/kg dose is 
warranted. 
The dose of sorafenib for this study, 400 mg  twice daily, is the approved dose for the 
treatment of unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma. 
2 Study Objectives 
2.1 Primary Objective 
• To evaluate the efficacy of ma patumumab in combination with sorafenib in subjects with 
advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. 
 
2.2 Secondary Objective 
• To evaluate the safety of the mapatumumab in combination with sorafenib in subjects with 
advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. 
• To determine serum mapatumumab concentrations. 
 
3 Study Design 
3.1 Basic Design Characteristics 
This is a Phase 2, multi-cen ter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to 
evaluate the efficacy and safety of mapatumuma b in combination with sorafenib in subjects 
with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma.   
In addition to receiving sorafenib, subjects will be randomly assigned to 1 of 2 treatment 
groups in a 1:1 ratio: 30 mg/ kg mapatumumab or placebo. 
Mapatumumab will be supplied in open labe l vials and third party unblinding will be 
employed. The study agent will be reconstituted by the unblinded site pharmacist or unblinded 
designee. The unblinded site pharmacist or un blinded designee will also be the person 
responsible for receiving and dispensing study agent, but independent of all other study 
activities. All other study site personnel, the subject, and the Sponsor will remain blinded to 
Human Genome Sciences, Inc. Confidential Page 23 
Protocol HGS1012-C1103 Amendment 00  Mapatumumab 
 
the study agent received. Separate monitors will be responsible for the clinical (blinded 
monitor) and study agent (unblinded monitor) aspects of the study. 
Number of Subjects: 
Approximately 100 subjects with advan ced HCC will be randomized/enrolled. 
Treatment Groups: Subjects will receive treatment every 21 days (ie, a cycle) as outlined below: Arm A: Sorafenib 400 mg orally twice daily continuously in each cycle + placebo 
intravenously on Day 1 of each cycle 
Arm B:  Sorafenib 400 mg orally twice daily continuously in each cycle + mapatumumab 
(30 mg/kg) intravenously on Day 1 of each cycle 
Randomization Randomization will be stratified according to BCLC advanced stage C vs BCLC intermediate 
stage B and ECOG performance status (0 vs 1, 2). Estimated Study Duration: The study is estimated to occur over approximately 24 months. Subjects will continue to 
receive sorafenib with or without mapatumumab/placebo until radiologic disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Estimated median le ngth of subject treatment is 6-8 months. All 
subjects will have an End of Tr eatment visit at least 30 days after the last dose of sorafenib 
and/or mapatumumab/placebo, whichever is later.  After discontinuation of  treatment, subjects 
will continue to be followed for radiologic disease assessments every 6 weeks (± 3 days), starting 6 weeks after the previous disease assessment while on treatment, until documented 
radiologic disease progression (if not previously documented). Thereafter, subjects will be followed every 3 months for survival until at least 90% of subjects have met the survival 
endpoint.

5 Study Treatment Regimen 
Sorafenib will be administered at a dose of 400 mg twice daily without  food (at least 1 hour 
before or 2 hours after a meal). On days wh en both sorafenib and mapatumumab/placebo are 
administered together, the sora fenib should be taken at the sa me time as any other calendar 
day. 
5.1 Mapatumumab and Placebo 
5.1.1 Formulation 
Mapatumumab will be supplied as  a lyophilized formulation in st erile, single-use 10 mL vials 
containing 100 mg mapatumumab. Upon reconstitu tion with 5.0 mL of sterile water for 
injection, each vial will contain 20 mg/mL mapatumumab in 0.13 mg/mL citric acid, 
2.8 mg/mL sodium citrate, 19 mg/mL glycine, 5 mg/mL sucrose, 0.2 mg/mL polysorbate 80, 
pH 6.5. 
Two hundred-fifty mL normal saline solution for intravenous infusion will be administered as 
placebo for mapatumumab. 
5.1.2 Packaging, Labeling, Preparation, and Storage 
The Pharmacy Manual will provide instructions for preparation and storage of study agent. 
The product will be securely stored at 2-8ºC. 
The study agent label will contain, at a minimum, the following information: 
• Product name 
• Concentration 
• Lot number 
• Storage instructions 
• Investigational drug statement 
• Manufacturer’s name and address 
 
Study agent inventory/accountability forms will be examined and reconciled by the unblinded 
study monitor or designee. At the end of the st udy, all used and unused investigational study 
agent will be accounted for on a study agent account ability form provided to the investigator 
by the Sponsor or designee. Pl ease refer to the HGS1012-C1103 Pharmacy Manual for more 
details regarding storage, handling and drug accountability. 
5.1.3 Mapatumumab/Placebo Dose, Route of Administration and Schedule 
The dose of mapatumumab is 30 mg/kg. Mapatumumab dose calculations will be based upon 
the subject’s weight measured on Day 1 or wi thin 3 days before Day 1 of each cycle. The 
planned duration of each treatment cycle will be 21 days. Mapatumumab/placebo will be administered on Day 1 of each cycle. 
Human Genome Sciences, Inc. Confidential Page 27 
Protocol HGS1012-C1103 Amendment 00  Mapatumumab 
 
After reconstitution with sterile water for injection, the calculated mapatumumab dose to be 
administered to the subject will be further di luted in normal saline to a total volume of 
250 mL for intravenous infusion. After adding the reconstituted product, the bag will be 
gently inverted to mix the solution. Following r econstitution and/or dilution in normal saline, 
mapatumumab will be stored at 2-8ºC. The product will be administered to the subject within 8 hours of reconstitution. Refer to the HGS 1012-C1103 Pharmacy Manual for instructions on 
admixing and administering study agent.  
Two hundred-fifty mL normal saline solution for intravenous infusion will be administered as 
placebo for mapatumumab. 
Mapatumumab/placebo will be infuse d at a constant rate over 1 hour. 
Infusion and hypersensitivity reactions may occu r. A suggested pre-medication regimen for 
mapatumumab/placebo consists of diphenhydram ine and acetaminophen administered within 
1 hour prior to the start of the mapatumumab/ placebo dose. Use of a pre-medication regimen 
and alternatives to this regimen are at the investigat or’s discretion. 
Subjects will be monitored closely during and after infusion for any sign of acute adverse 
reaction. If an allergic reaction occurs, see Section 5.1.5 and Appendix 8 for suggested 
medical management. 
5.1.4 Mapatumumab/Placebo Dose Toxicity/Delay 
Mapatumumab/placebo may be delayed up to 2 w eeks for toxicities considered related to 
mapatumumab as described below or if the investigator believes that a delay in dosing is 
warranted in the interest of subject safety. 
The National Cancer Institute Common Te rminology Criteria for Adverse Events 
(NCI-CTCAE, Version 4.0) will be used to grade AEs. 
• Grade 4 neutropenia for > 7 consecutive days or febrile neutropenia. 
• Grade 4 thrombocytopenia. 
• Grade 3 or greater non-hematologic AEs ex cept transient transaminase, amylase and 
lipase abnormalities for which the following criteria will apply: 
- Grade 3 or Grade 4 elevations in transami nases that do not resolve to baseline or 
Grade 1 before the next cycle. 
- Grade 4 elevations in lipase or amylase associated with clinical/imaging findings of pancreatitis, or resulting in ch ronic damage to the pancreas.  
- Any Grade 4 elevations in lipase or amylase for > 4 consecutive days. 
 If mapatumumab/placebo is delayed for toxi city and the toxicity does not resolve ( ≤ Grade 1) 
or return to baseline within 2 weeks after th e delayed dose was originally scheduled (based on 
a 21-day treatment cycle), the subject will be withdrawn fr om further treatment with 
mapatumumab/placebo. If mapatumumab/placebo is  delayed because the investigator believes 
a delay is warranted in the interest of subject safety and dosing of mapatumumab/placebo is not resumed within 2 weeks after the delaye d dose was originally scheduled (based on a 
Human Genome Sciences, Inc. Confidential Page 28 
Protocol HGS1012-C1103 Amendment 00  Mapatumumab 
 
21-day treatment cycle), the subject will be  withdrawn from future treatment with 
mapatumumab/placebo. Sorafenib dosing will  continue while mapatumumab/placebo dosing 
is held. The subject will continue receiving so rafenib until radiologic progressive disease or 
an unacceptable toxicity occurs, at the discretion of the Investigator.  
Doses of mapatumumab may not be altered. 
5.1.5 Management of Allergic/H ypersensitivity Reactions to 
Mapatumumab/Placebo 
The administration of any recombinant protein has the potential to induce local or system 
immunologic reactions; subjects co uld experience, for example, acute allergic reactions. To 
date, 2 such SAEs have been reported which were considered related to mapatumumab (hypersensitivity and angioedema/facial edema) . In the event of allergic/hypersensitivity 
reactions, investigators will institute treatment measures according to best medical and 
nursing practice. Guidelines for treatment are provided in Appendix 8. 
For a NCI-CTCAE Version 4.0 Grade 3 or Grade 4 hypersensitivity reac tion, treatment with 
mapatumumab/placebo will be discontinued. 
If mapatumumab/placebo is discontinued for Gr ade 3 or Grade 4 hypersensitivity reactions, 
the subject will continue to receive sorafeni b, until radiologic progression or unacceptable 
toxicity. 
5.2 Sorafenib 
5.2.1 Packaging, Labeling, Preparation, and Storage 
Sorafenib is supplied as tablet s, each containing 274 mg sorafenib tosylate, equivalent to 
200 mg of sorafenib. 
The recommended daily dose of sorafenib is 400 mg (2 x 200 mg tablets) taken orally twice 
daily without food (at least 1 hour be fore or 2 hours after a meal). 
Sorafenib will be stored at room temperature (15-30°C, 59-86°F) in a dry place. For country-specific formulation and packaging information, pleas e refer to the instructions 
provided in the sorafenib product labeling. Supplier: Commercially available. 
5.2.2 Anticipated Toxicities with Sorafenib 
Toxicities anticipated with the use of sorafenib include the following: 
• Cardiac: Cardiac ischemia a nd/or infarction, hypertension. 
• Dermatologic: Hand-foot skin reaction, rash/desquamation. 
• Hemorrhagic: Increased risk of bleeding. 
• Gastrointestinal: Gastrointestinal perforation. 
Human Genome Sciences, Inc. Confidential Page 29

• Other: Wound-healing complications, fatigue, weight-loss, alopecia, pruritis, dry skin, 
diarrhea, anorexia, nausea, vom iting, constipation, liver dysfunction and abdominal pain. 
 
Laboratory abnormalities observed in hepatocellular  carcinoma patients tr eated with sorafenib 
include hypophosphatemia, lipase elevations , amylase elevations, hypoalbuminemia, 
international normalized ratio elevati ons, lymphopenia and thrombocytopenia. 
Refer to the product labeling accompanying th e product for information approved in your 
country. 
5.2.3 Alteration of Sorafenib Dose/Schedule Due to Toxicity 
Sorafenib may be reduced or delayed for toxicities considered related to sorafenib as 
described below, or if the inve stigator believes that a reduction in dose is warranted in the 
interest of subject safety. When a dose re duction is necessary, sorafenib dose may be 
reduced to 400 mg once daily. If an additiona l dose reduction is requir ed, sorafenib may be 
reduced to a single  400 mg dose every other day (see Table 5-1 ). A maximum of 2 dose 
reductions of sorafenib will be allowed per subject. Additional dose reductions not mentioned in Table 5-1  will need to be discussed with the medical monitor.  
Table 5-1 Sorafenib dose levels 
Dose Levels Sorafenib 
0 400 mg twice daily

Skin toxicity and hypertension are associated with sorafenib. Guidelines for the management 
of these events are provided in Table 5-2  and Table 5-3 , respectively.  
Skin Toxicity 
Hand-foot skin reaction and rash are common in subjects treated with sorafenib. Management 
may include topical therapies for symptomatic relief, temporary treatment interruption and/or 
dose modification, or in severe or persistent cases, permanent discontinuation. Skin toxicities 
will be managed according to Table 5-2 .

See Table 5-2 and Table 5-3  for dose modifications due to skin toxicity and hypertension respectively. 
*Subjects who develop Grade 3 fever/chills, Grade 3 elev ation of hepatic transaminases with ALT and AST 
< 10X upper limit of normal, Grade 3 hyperlipasemia or hyperamylasemia without clinical or other evidence of 
pancreatitis, Grade 3 leukopenia, or Grade 3/Grade 4 ly mphopenia may continue sorafenib treatment without 
interruption at the discretion of the investigator.  
 
Sorafenib Discontinuation Temporary or permanent discontinuation of sora fenib will be considered in subjects who 
develop cardiac ischemia and/or infarction or  severe or persistent hypertension despite 
institution of antihypertensive therapy. If a subject experiences a bleeding event that 
necessitates medical intervention or a gastrointestinal perforation, sorafenib will be 
Human Genome Sciences, Inc. Confidential Page 32 
Protocol HGS1012-C1103 Amendment 00  Mapatumumab 
 
permanently discontinued. Subjects, who undergo a surgical procedure or intervention to 
decrease portal hypertension, including transju gular intrahepatic porto systemic shunt, will 
discontinue sorafenib. 
If the subject is withdrawn from further treatment  with sorafenib, the subject may continue to 
receive mapatumumab/placebo alone every 21 days until radiologic progression or 
unacceptable toxicity. 
5.3 Concurrent Medicat ions and Therapies 
5.3.1 Allowable Regimens 
Subjects may continue their baseline medication( s). The daily dose of each medication will be 
maintained throughout the study if possible. If for any reason deemed necessary by the 
investigator, a subject requires additional medication(s) or change of dose, the medication(s), 
dosage change, route of administration, and th e indication for which it was given must be 
recorded in the source documents. All concom itant medications will be recorded on the 
appropriate case report form. 
Systemic, inhaled and topical steroids used as part of an antiemetic regimen or 
maintenance-dose for non-cancerous disease are permitted. 
5.3.2 Prohibited Medications 
Subjects who require the use of strong CYP3A4  inducers (eg, including but not limited to 
St. John’s Wort, dexamethasone, phenytoin, carbamazepine, rifampin, rifabutin, 
phenobarbital) are not eligible for this study and use of these agents is prohibited as long as 
the subject is receiving sorafenib in this study. 
Subjects will not receive any investigational or noninvestigational cy totoxic chemotherapy, 
hormonal therapy, biological therapy (including monoclonal antibodies) or immunotherapy to 
treat hepatocellular carcinoma during the treatm ent period. Alternativ e anticancer therapies 
may be administered after radiologic disease progression has been documented, but will be avoided if possible during the 30 day safety fo llow up period after the last dose of study agent 
(mapatumumab/placebo and/or sorafenib) whicheve r is last. These medications are allowed in 
the long-term follow-up period after the 30 day safety follow-up period and documentation of radiologic disease progression. 
5.3.3 Prohibited Therapies 
Subjects will not undergo major or  elective surgery during the trea tment period of the study; if 
surgery is required, the subject will be withdrawn from study treatment.

• Obtain medical history, to include history of all treatments used to tr eat the current cancer 
and all prior cancer treatments. 
• Perform baseline complete physical examin ation including body weight and height. 
• Assess vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, respirat ory rate and temperature). 
• Evaluate performance status (ECOG scale; see Appendix 3). 
• Draw blood for laboratory tests (see Appendix 7): complete blood count with differential, 
chemistry , hepatitis B surface antigen, Hepatitis  B virus DNA, hepatitis C antibody and 
testing for serum pregnancy (all females with an intact uterus [unless amenorrheic for the 
previous 24 months] regardless of age). 
• Obtain radiologic disease and AFP assessments . The method of disease assessment, as per 
mRECIST for HCC (see Appendix 5), will be consistent throughout the study.  
• Obtain electrocardiogram. 
• Record medications used within 28 days before enrollment. 
• Confirm that subject meets all inclusion/exclusion criteria. 
 
6.2 Study Enrollment/Randomization Procedures 
Subjects that meet the eligibility criteria will be randomly assigned treatment by a 
central interactive voice response system in a 1:1 ratio to 1 of 2 treatment arms. The 
randomization will be stratified according to BCLC advanced stage C vs BCLC intermediate 
stage B and ECOG performance status (0 vs 1, 2). The 1st planned dose of sorafenib and 
mapatumumab/placebo will be administered no  more than 3 days following randomization 
and not prior to randomization. All study site personnel (with the exception of the unblinded site pharmacist or unblinded designee), the subjec t, and the Sponsor will remain blinded to the

6 Biomarkers: For subjects parti cipating in the optional biomarker sub-study, hi storical biopsy samples will be collected, if av ailable, and samples will be collected if obtained during the 
treatment period in Cycle 1 Days 1 (pre-dose mapatumumab), 2, 3, 8 and 15 and Cycle 2 Days 1 (pre-dose mapatumumab), 3, 8 and 1 5. In addition, blood samples will be obtained 
as follows: blood for isolation of DNA will be collected once, pref erably in Cycle 1. Blood for isolation of serum will be coll ected in Cycles 1 and 2 (pre-dose on the day of 
mapatumumab/placebo dosing). Further details on the biomarker sub-study are outlined in Appendix 6 . 
7 Study Agent Administration:  Sorafenib will be administered at a dose of 400 mg twice daily without food (at least 1 hour befo re or 2 hours after a meal). On days when both sorafenib 
and mapatumumab/placebo are administered together , sorafenib should be taken at the same time as any other calendar day. 
8 Vital Signs: Blood pressure will be monitored weekly for the first 6 weeks. Vital signs will be obtained within 30 minutes pri or to administration of mapatumumab/placebo and at the 
end of infusion on Day 1 of each cycle. 
9 Body Weight: To be obtained on the day of or with in 3 days before dosing on Day 1 of each cycle.

12 Disease and α – Fetoprotein (AFP) Assessments: Radiologic and AFP assessments w ill be performed at the end of every 2 cycles (ie, Cycles 2, 4, 6, etc). For subjects discontinuing 
treatment prior to documentation of radiol ogic disease progression, disease assessm ents will be performed every 6 weeks (± 3 da ys), starting 6 weeks after the previous disease 
assessment while on study, until radiologic disease progressi on is documented. If disease progr ession is based only on new lesi ons or is equivocal, images will be provided to the 
blinded, independent reader for confirmation of disease progression. All imaging scans  used for disease assessments will be mad e available for independent r adiology review by the 
Sponsor or designee. 
13 Survival : Contact will be made with the subject every 3 months to document survival until at leas t 90% of subjects hav e met the survival endpoint. 
14 Subjects who discontinue mapatumumab/placebo will complete the current cycle assessments per the study calendar.  Subsequently, subjects receiving sorafenib alone will return at 
least every 21 days and on additional days as  clinically indicated for safety labs (CBC with differential, chemistry and coagul ation parameters) for the duration of treatment. Disease 
assessments must be performed every 6 weeks until radiologic diseas e progression.  Adverse events and concomitant medications w ill be recorded throughout the study.

 6.4 Follow-up Procedures 
6.4.1 Safety Follow-up 
After discontinuation of study trea tment, all subjects will return 1 day af ter cycle completion 
(approximately Day 22) and at least 30 days after the last dose of sorafenib and/or 
mapatumumab/placebo, for scheduled safety follow-up assessments as outlined in Table 6-1 . 
6.4.2 Long-term Follow-up For subjects discontinuing treatment  prior to documentation of ra diologic disease progression, 
and for subjects who experience stable diseas e or a response (PR, CR) but are no longer 
receiving treatment, radiologic disease assessments will be performed at 6 week intervals 
(± 3 days), starting 6 weeks after the previo us radiologic disease assessment while on 
treatment, until radiologic disease progression is documented. Thereafter, subjects will be followed every 3 months for survival until at least 90%  of subjects have met the survival 
endpoint. 
6.5 Withdrawal of S ubjects from Treatment 
Subjects will be free to withdraw  from treatment at any time, for any reason, or they may be 
withdrawn/removed, if necessary, to protect thei r health (see reasons for withdrawal below). It 
is understood by all concerned that an excessi ve rate of withdrawals can render the study 
uninterpretable; therefore, unnecessary wit hdrawal of subjects will be avoided. 
Subjects may be withdrawn from treatment for any of the following reasons: 
• Radiologic disease progression. 
• Continued unacceptable toxicities despite optimal treatment or dose reduction. 
• Intercurrent illness, at the investigator’s discretion. 
• Withdrawal of consent. 
• Non-compliance/Lost to follow-up. 
• Pregnancy. 
• Termination of the study by the sponsor. 
 Subjects who withdraw are to be followed for radiologic progression as outlined in Section 6.4.2. In addition, every effort will be made to collect safety information on each 
subject through 30 days following the last dose of study treatment, unless the subject withdraws consent and refuses to comply with the protocol stipulated safety follow-up and 
radiologic disease progression assessments, or sh are information obtained after the date of 
withdrawal of consent. 
6.6 Withdrawal of Subjects from Study 
Subjects may be withdrawn from the study for any of the following reasons: 
• Withdrawal of consent. 
Human Genome Sciences, Inc. Confidential Page 38 
Protocol HGS1012-C1103 Amendment 00  Mapatumumab 
 
 • Non-compliance/Lost to follow-up. 
• Termination of the study by the sponsor. 
 
Every effort will be made to collect follow-up information on subjects in the long-term follow-up period of the study, unless the subjec t withdraws consent and refuses to share 
information obtained during the long-term fo llow-up period obtained after the date of 
withdrawal of consent. 
6.7 Disease Respon se Assessments 
Imaging endpoints will be determined using th e modified RECIST criteria for HCC proposed 
by Lencioni and Llovet (2010; mRECIST). mREC IST for HCC is a joint guideline of the 
American Association for the Study of Liver Di seases and the Journal of the National Cancer 
Institute.  
Lesions which manifest typical imaging charac teristics for HCC demonstrate intratumoral 
arterial contrast on CT and MRI images. mR ECIST accounts for newer therapies which may 
impact tumor vascularity and may not yield a t ypical cytotoxic decrease in tumor size by 
incorporating changes in vascular ity into the criteria for target  lesion response. Diligence in 
obtaining images during the hepatic arterial cont rast enhancement phase is a requirement at 
baseline and all subsequent scans. The same imaging method must be used at baseline and 
during follow up. As in conventional RECIST, overall response is the result of the combined assessment of 
target, nontarget, and new lesions. There are also  specifications for inco rporating portal vein 
thrombosis, portal hepatic lymph nodes, and pl eural effusions/ascites into the response 
assessment. As with conventional RECIST, th e appearance of any ne w lesion overrides any 
existing lesion response, resulting in classification as progressive  disease (PD). Key aspects of 
mRECIST as adapted for this study are summarized in Appendix 4. 
Baseline images will be provided to the BICR for confirmation of radiologic eligibility 
(measurable disease). Confirmation of radiologic eligibility for the study will be provided to the site by the BICR within 72 hours of receipt of images and will be required for randomization. 
Disease assessments and an assessment of α -fetoprotein will be perf ormed at the end of every 
2 cycles (ie, Cycles 2, 4, 6 and every 2 cy cles thereafter). The response assessment will be 
performed and documented no more than 5 days befo re the start of the next cycle. All images 
will be provided to the BICR following each disease assessment. If disease progression is based only on new lesion s or is equivocal, images will be provided to 
the BICR for confirmation of ra diologic disease progression prior to disc ontinuing study 
treatment. PR and CR will be confirmed at the next scheduled disease assessment (no fewer 
than 4 weeks after the initial  documentation of PR or CR).

 7 Pharmacokinetic, Immunogenicity, Pharmacodynamic and 
Exploratory Assessments 
7.1 Pharmacokinetic Assessments 
For determination of mapatumumab concentration, serum samples will be collected as 
outlined in Table 6-1 . 
A manual will be provided regarding how to obtain blood samples, process samples, collect serum from the blood samples, and how to store and ship the serum samples. Bioanalysis will 
be carried out at Human Genome Sciences to  determine mapatumumab concentration in each 
serum sample. 
7.2 Immunogenicity 
Blood samples for serum antibodies to mapatumumab will be obtained as outlined in  Table 6-1 .  
7.3 Pharmacodynamic Assessments 
Subjects will be given the option to particip ate in an exploratory biomarker research 
sub-study. Consenting subjects will be asked to provide a historically obtained biopsy sample, if available, and blood samples. In addition, samples will be requested from subjects who undergo a biopsy during the treatment period. 
To examine and quantify biomarkers present peripherally, blood will be drawn during 
Cycles 1 and 2, from which DNA and serum pr oteins will be isolated. The parameters 
evaluated may include, but may not be limited to, M30, TNF α, sTRAIL, soluble Fas ligand, 
interferon- α, interferon- γ, interleukin-2, interleukin-6, interleukin-8, interleukin-10, 
interleukin-12, and FC gamma receptor an d interleukin-6 gene polymorphisms. The 
biomarker sub-study is detailed in Appendix 6.  
7.4 Exploratory Assessments (B  and T Lymphocyte Subsets) 
7.4.1 Rationale for B and T Lymphocyte Analysis 
Over 400 subjects have received mapatumumab in doses ranging from 0.01 to 30 mg/kg 
across multiple Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials in subjects with solid and hematologic malignancies. While there is no evidence to date that mapatumumab exacerbates adverse events associated with chemotherapy, the most commonly observed laboratory abnormality 
associated with mapatumumab has been lym phopenia. The lymphopenia has been intermittent 
and reversible and was not associated with infectious events. However, the lymphocyte 
subpopulation(s) affected have not been characterized. 
The evaluation of lymphocytes will include co mplete blood count/diffe rential and lymphocyte 
subpopulation analysis (numbers and percentage s of T and B cells) by flow cytometry at a 
central laboratory. Blood samples will be examin ed by flow cytometry for levels of T helper 
(CD4+), T cytotoxic (CD8+) and mature B cells (CD19+). 
Human Genome Sciences, Inc. Confidential Page 40 
Protocol HGS1012-C1103 Amendment 00  Mapatumumab 
 
 7.4.2 Collection of Samples for B and T Lymphocyte Analysis 
Blood samples will be collected for quantification of B and T lymphocyte subsets on Day 1 
(prior to dosing) and Day 15 of Cycles 1 and 2 as outlined in Table 6-1 . 
8 Adverse Event Reporting 
8.1 Definitions 
ADVERSE EVENT (EXPERIENCE) - any unfavorab le or unintended sign, symptom, or 
disease that is temporally associated with the use of a study agent but is not necessarily caused 
by the study agent. This includes worsening (e g, increase in frequency or severity) of 
pre-existing conditions. 
SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT – an adverse event re sulting in any of the following outcomes: 
• death 
• is life threatening (ie, an immediate threat to life) 
• inpatient hospitalization 
• prolongation of an existing hospitalization 
• persistent or significant disability / incapacity 
• congenital anomaly / birth defect 
• is Medically Important* 
 
*Medical and scientific judgment will be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting is appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be immediately 
life threatening or result in death or result in hospitalization but may jeopardize the patient or may require intervention to pr event one of the other outcomes listed above. These should also 
usually be considered serious . (ICH guidelines, March 1995) 
Note: Hospitalizations not associated with an adverse event, for example, for administration 
of chemotherapy or hydration for chemotherapy administration, are not considered serious 
adverse events. 
UNEXPECTED ADVERSE EVENT - An adverse event,  the nature or seve rity of which is 
not consistent with the applicable product info rmation (eg, Investigator’s Brochure for an 
unapproved investigational product or package insert/summary of  product characteristics for 
an approved product). Expected means that the event has previously been observed with the 
study agent and is identified and/or described in the applicable product information. It does 
not mean that the event is expected with  the underlying diseas e(s) or concomitant 
medications. 
8.2 Reporting Adverse Events to  the Sponsor or Designee 
All adverse events (AEs) that are identified from th e start of any study agent administration 
through the specified study follow-up period (t hrough 30 days following administration of the 
Human Genome Sciences, Inc. Confidential Page 41 
Protocol HGS1012-C1103 Amendment 00  Mapatumumab 
 
 final study agent dose) will be recorded on th e paper/electronic Adverse Event Case Report 
Form (AE case report form). All data fields on the AE case report form will be completed. 
Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) must ALSO be recorded on the SAE Worksheet and sent to 
HGS within 24 hours of site personnel becoming aware of a SAE, regardless of expectedness. 
All pages of the SAE Worksheet will be comple ted, but the SAE worksheet will not be held 
until all information is available. Additional information and corrections will be provided on 
subsequent SAE Worksheets as described in  the Study Procedure Manual. SAE Worksheets 
will be sent by facsimile to the Drug Safety Department at HGS using the fax number listed below. 
FAX #:  
8.3 Laboratory Abnormalities as Adverse Events 
A laboratory abnormality will be reported as an adverse event if it is associated with an 
intervention. Intervention includes, but is not  limited to, discontinuation of treatment, dose 
reduction/delay, additional assessments (excluding follow-up labs), or concomitant therapy. In 
addition, any medically important laboratory abnormality may be reported as an adverse event 
at the discretion of the inves tigator. This includes laboratory  abnormalities for which there is 
no intervention but the abnormal value(s) suggests  a disease or organ toxicity. If clinical 
sequelae are associated with a laboratory abnormality, the diagnos is or medical condition will 
be reported (eg, renal failure, hematuria) not the laboratory abnormality (eg, elevated creatinine, urine red blood cells increased). 
8.4 Other Events Requiring Rapid Reporting 
Protocol Specified Events are additional events [toxicities] specifically identified in this protocol that must be reported to Human Ge nome Sciences or designee in an expedited 
manner. Protocol Specified Events may or may not be SAEs as defined in  this protocol. They 
are SAEs if they meet one or more of  the criteria for an SAE (see Section 8.1). Protocol 
Specified Events are recorded on SAE Worksheets and sent to Human Genome Sciences within 24 hours of site personnel becoming aware of the event. 
The Protocol Specified Events for the study: 
• Grade 4 neutropenia for > 7 consecutive days or febrile neutropenia. 
• Grade 4 thrombocytopenia. 
• Grade 3 or greater non-hematologic AEs ex cept transient transaminase, amylase and 
lipase abnormalities for which the following criteria apply: 
• Grade 3 or Grade 4 elevations in transaminase s that do not resolve to baseline or Grade 1 
before the next cycle 
• Grade 4 elevations in lipase or amylase associated with clinical/imaging findings of 
pancreatitis, or resulting in ch ronic damage to the pancreas. 
• Any Grade 4 elevations in lipase or amylase for > 4 consecutive days. 
• Grade 3/4 elevations in liver func tion tests regardless of causality. 
PPD
Human Genome Sciences, Inc. Confidential Page 42 
Protocol HGS1012-C1103 Amendment 00  Mapatumumab 
 
 • Any adverse event that results in discontinuation of treatment if that event is assessed as 
possibly, probably, or definitely related to mapatumumab or sorafenib. 
 
8.5 Reporting a Pregnancy 
Any pregnancy in a female participant or a female partner of a male participant  must be 
reported to Human Genome Sciences Drug Safety as soon as the site becomes aware of the 
pregnancy. All pregnancies are reported up to 30 days following the last study agent 
treatment. Human Genome Sciences Drug Safe ty sends an acknowledgement memorandum to 
the principal investigator along with a Pre gnancy Assessment Form. Additional Pregnancy 
Assessment Forms will be sent to the site every 3 months for reporting of follow-up 
information. Pregnancy assessment forms must be completed by the investigator until live birth, elective termination of the pregnancy, or miscarriage. The site is responsible for 
following the subject’s pregnancy to final outcome. 
Pregnancies are not considered adverse events. Complications or medical problems associated 
with a pregnancy are considered AEs and may be SAEs. Complications or medical problems 
are reported as AEs/SAEs according to the procedure described in Section 8.2. 
8.6 Investigator Evalua tion of Adverse Events 
The Investigator will evaluate all adverse events with respect to seriousness (criteria listed in 
Section 8.1 above), severity (intensity or grade) and causality (relationship to study agent) 
according to the following guidelines listed below. 
SEVERITY Severity will be graded using the NCI-C TCAE, Version 4.0. The NCI-CTCAE may 
be downloaded from the Cancer Treatment Evaluation Program website 
(http://ctep.info.nih.gov/reporting/ctc.html). In  the event that an AE does not have an 
NCI-CTCAE code, the following severity  classifications will be used: 
Mild  causing no limitation of usual activities 
Moderate causing some limitation of usual activities Severe causing inability to carry out usual activities Life Threatening* potentially lif e threatening or disabling  
 
*Note – a severity assessment of life threatening is  not necessarily the sa me as life threatening 
as a “Serious” criterion. The latter means that  the event is an immedi ate threat to life as 
opposed to a potential threat to life. 
  
Human Genome Sciences, Inc. Confidential Page 43 
Protocol HGS1012-C1103 Amendment 00  Mapatumumab 
 
 CAUSALITY 
Definitely Related reasonable temporal relationship to study agent administration 
 follows a known response pattern (eg, drug is known to cause this AE) 
 there is no alternative etiology 
Probably Related reasonable temporal relationship 
 follows a suspected response patter n (eg, based on similar drugs) 
 no evidence for a more likely alternative etiology 
Possibly Related reasonable temporal relationship 
 little evidence for a more likely alternative etiology 
Probably Not Related does not have a reasonable temporal relationship, OR 
 good evidence for a more lik ely alternative etiology 
Not Related does not have a temporal relationship, OR  definitely due to alternative etiology  
 ICH guidelines (March, 1995) clarif y “reasonable causal relationshi p” to mean “that there are 
facts [evidence] or arguments to  suggest a causal relationship”. 
The causality assessment must be made by the i nvestigator based on information available at 
the time that the SAE worksheet is completed. The initial causality asse ssment may be revised 
as new information becomes available. 
 *Note -  If there is evidence that mapatumumab/ placebo contributed to or exacerbated an 
event related to sorafenib; the event will be recorded as possibly, probably or definitely 
related to both sorafenib and mapatumumab. 
8.7 Follow-up of Adverse Events 
Adverse events that occur during the course of the study are followed until final outcome is 
known or until the end of the safety follow-up pe riod (30 days following th e final dose of any 
study agent). Adverse events  that have not resolved by the e nd of the safety follow-up period 
are recorded as ongoing. 
SAEs that have not resolved by the end of the follow-up pe riod are followed until final 
outcome of recovered or recovere d with sequelae is ach ieved. If it is not possible to obtain a 
final outcome for a SAE (eg, the subject is lost  to follow up), the reason a final outcome could 
not be obtained will be documented by the investigator. 
8.8 Serious Adverse Events Assessed During Long-Term Follow-up 
SAEs that occur after the safety follow-up period (30 days following the final dose of study 
agent) that are assessed by the investigator as po ssibly, probably, or defi nitely related to study 
agent must be reported to Human Genome Sciences on an SAE worksheet, as described in Section 8.2. Post-study SAEs will not be documented on the AE case report form. 
Human Genome Sciences, Inc. Confidential Page 44 
Protocol HGS1012-C1103 Amendment 00  Mapatumumab 
 
 8.9 Reporting Serious Ad verse Events to the Institutional Review 
Board/Ethics Committee 
All SAEs that are considered unexpected and related to the study agen t will be reported by 
Human Genome Sciences or its designee as exped ited (ie, 15-Day) reports to the appropriate 
regulatory authorities AND to all participating i nvestigators. Each invest igator must notify the 
Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics Comm ittee (IEC) responsible for 
reviewing the study at their site of all expedited reports. In addition, Human Genome Sciences 
or its designee will follow all applicable local and national regulatory requirements regarding safety reporting. Each investigator must also comply with the applicable regulatory requirements related to the repor ting of SAEs to the IRB/IEC responsible for reviewing the 
study at their site, as well as the regu latory authority(ies) (if applicable). 
9 Endpoints and Stat istical Analysis 
9.1 General Statistical Considerations 
Analyses will be applied to a modified intentio n-to-treat population unl ess stated otherwise. 
This population is defined as the set of all ra ndomized subjects who receive at least 1 dose of 
study treatment (mapatumumab/placebo and/or sora fenib) with subjects analyzed according to 
the groups they are randomized to, regardless of the treatment they subsequently receive. 
Additional analyses may be performed on the as -treated population, defined as the set of 
subjects receiving at least 1 dose of study medi cation analyzed according to the treatment that 
they actually receive. 
Analyses will be performed using the SAS System™, WinNonlin Enterprise Edition™, 
StatXact™, and the R statistical package. 
9.2 Sample Size Rationale 
A total of approximately 100 subjects will be randomly assigned to 1 of 2 arms and treated 
with either sorafenib + placebo or the 2-agent combination of sorafenib and mapatumumab at 
30 mg/kg in a 1:1 ratio. A sample size of 50 subjects randomized and treated in each group is sufficient to estimate the median time to progre ssion with a precision of approximately -1.9 M 
to +2.6 M relative to the observed median. In  addition, a sample size of 50 patients per arm 
will provide 80% power to detect an improveme nt in TTP from 5.5 to 8.9 M with at a 
one-sided significance level of 0.10.  
9.3 Efficacy 
9.3.1 Primary Efficacy Endpoint 
The primary endpoint is time to progression (TTP) defined as the time from randomization to 
radiologic disease progression based on blinded independent review of imaging scans.  
9.3.2 Primary Efficacy Analysis 
The primary analysis will be an estimate of median time to progressi on in each arm using 
Kaplan Meier methods, reported with 95% confid ence intervals, along with logrank testing at 
Human Genome Sciences, Inc. Confidential Page 45 
Protocol HGS1012-C1103 Amendment 00  Mapatumumab 
 
 a 1-sided significance level of 0.10 for a di fference between treatment groups controlling for 
factors stratifying the randomization. 
9.3.3 Secondary Efficacy Endpoints 
Secondary endpoints include progression-free su rvival, overall response, disease control, 
overall survival, time to response, and duration of response (for responde rs) as defined below: 
• OS: time from randomization to death from any cause. 
• PFS: time from randomization to disease progression or death from any cause. 
• Objective response (CR+PR according to mRECIST for HCC). 
• Disease control (CR+PR+SD according to mRECIST for HCC). 
• Time to response: time from randomization to 1st PR or CR in responders only. 
• Duration of response: time from 1st PR or CR to disease progression; in responders only. 
 
All secondary endpoints will be based on blinded independent review of imaging scans. 
9.3.4 Secondary Efficacy Analyses 
Secondary analyses include estimates, using Kaplan Meier methods, of median PFS and 
median OS along with associated  logrank testing. In addition,  estimates of overall response 
rate (CR+PR) and disease control rate (CR+PR +SD) will be reported with 95% confidence 
intervals and an estimate of the difference in response rates and diseas e control rates between 
groups will be reported and tested for significance with a Pearson chi-square test (or Fisher’s 
exact test).  
9.4 Safety 
9.4.1 Definition of Safety Variables  The safety parameters assessed are given by the following: 
• Frequency, and severity of adverse events (AEs): 
- All AEs will be classified by System Or gan Class and Preferred Term under the 
Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) system of classification with 
a severity assigned accordi ng to the NCI-CTCAE (Version 4.0, 29 May 2009), or the 
rules specified in Section 8.6. 
- Laboratory parameters as presented in Appendix 7 . 
- Laboratory toxicities will be graded based on the NCI-CTCAE (Version 4.0, 29 May 2009). 
• Anti-mapatumumab antibody response.  
• Vital signs. 
• For frequency and severity of adverse events  and laboratory toxicity  grading, counts and 
rates will be presented.

Protocol HGS1012-C1103 Amendment 00  Mapatumumab 
 
 9.4.2 Human Genome Sciences Safety Review Committee 
The Human Genome Sciences Re view Committeee (HGSRC) is co mprised of the Department 
Heads of Biostatistics, Regulatory Affairs and Drug Development. The HGSRC will review 
safety data after: (1) 10 subjects have comple ted 1 cycle; and (2) 30 subjects have completed 
1 cycle. HGSRC reviews of safety data will  be conducted approximately every 4 months 
thereafter, until 90% of subjects have reached radiologic progression. The HGSRC may 
conduct additional reviews at thei r own request and/or at the re quest of the Medical Monitor. 
The HGSRC may request the un blinding of treatment assignment for a subject and/or 
treatment groups. If treatment assignments are unblinded, the rationale for the unblinding will 
be documented. 
9.4.3 Analysis of Safety Variables 
The safety analysis will consist of a presentati on of rates of AEs observed. Specific AEs will 
be counted once for each subject for calculating rate s, but will be presented in total in subject 
listings. In addition, if the same AE occurs multiple times within a particular subject, the 
highest severity and level of causality observed will be reported. If any associations of interest 
between AEs and baseline characteristics are ob served, additional stratified results may be 
presented. All treatment-emergent AEs will be summarized overall, as well as categorized by 
the MedDRA system of classification. AEs will be presented overall, by severity, by relation 
to mapatumumab/placebo, and by relation to sorafenib. 
9.5 Pharmacokinetics 
9.5.1 Definition of Pharmacokinetic Evaluation Serum mapatumumab concentration data obtained from this study will be pooled with data 
obtained from other studies fo r use in a population PK analys is, which will be reported 
separately. 
9.5.2 Analysis of Pharmacokinetics 
The serum mapatumumab concentration will be determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent 
assay. Serum mapatumumab concentration resu lts for this study will be presented using 
appropriate graphic and tabular summaries. 
9.6 Pharmacodynamics 
Expression of biomarkers in tumor tissue and pe ripheral blood will be correlated with clinical 
outcomes and may be reported separately  from the clinical study report.

subject or otherwise affects statements in th e informed consent form, the informed consent 
form must be revised accordingly and submitted to the IRB/IEC for review and approval. The approved consent form must be us ed to obtain informed consen t from new subjects prior to 
enrollment and must be used to obtain informed consent from subjects already enrolled if they are affected by the amendment. 
10.5 Data Collection and Management 
Data collected for each study subject are re corded electronically on case report forms 
provided or approved by the sponsor.  
Human Genome Sciences, Inc. Confidential Page 48 
Protocol HGS1012-C1103 Amendment 00  Mapatumumab 
 
 The investigator is responsible for maintaining accurate, complete, and up-to-date records for 
each subject. The investigator is also responsible for maintaining any source documents related to the study, incl uding any films, tracings, computer discs, or tapes. The investigator 
must promptly review the completed case report forms for each subject. As the person ultimately responsible for the accu racy of all data, the investigat or must sign the Investigator's 
Statement in each subject's case report form. 
The anonymity of participating subjects must be maintained. Subjects are identified by an 
assigned subject number on case report forms and other documents submitted to the sponsor. 
Documents that identify the subject beyond subj ect number are not submitted to the sponsor 
(ie, the signed informed consent document) and must be maintained in strict confidence by the 
investigator, except to the extent necessary to  allow auditing by the regulatory authorities, 
study monitor, or sponsor representatives. 
Sites enter subject data directly into the el ectronic data capture (EDC) system and the EDC 
system automatically generates queries result ing from computer checks embedded into the 
system, so as to ensure accuracy, quality, consistency, and completeness of the database. 
Manual queries resulting from review by m onitors, medical coders, and other Data 
Management staff are also generated from w ithin the EDC system, where they are tracked. 
Sites resolve the queries and correct the entered data when necessary. Every change to data is 
captured in the EDC system audit trail. At study end, each site is provided with a compact disk containing the electronic case re port forms for each of their subjects. 
Upon completion of the study, or after reaching a pre-specified point in the study, Data Management locks the database and generates the SAS datasets necessary for data analysis 
and reporting. 
10.6 Study Monitoring 
The study sponsor, Human Genome Sciences, Inc., or designee, will monitor the study. Study 
monitors representing the sponsor will visit study sites routinely throughout the trial. The 
sponsor will review the paper subject diarie s and electronic case report forms and compare 
them with source documents to verify accurate and complete collection of data and confirm that the study is being conducted according to the protocol. Auditors representing the sponsor 
may also similarly evaluate the study and its monitors. For these purpos es, the investigator 
will make paper subject diaries and electronic case report forms and source documents available when requested. 
In addition, the study may be evaluated by  representatives of the national regulatory 
authorities, who will also be allowed access to study documents. The investigators will 
promptly notify Human Genome Sciences of any audits they have scheduled with any 
regulatory authority. 
10.7 Drug Accountability 
Upon receipt, the designated unblinded pharmacy personnel at the study site are responsible 
for taking an inventory of the study agent, incl uding any buffers or dilu ents. A record of this 
Human Genome Sciences, Inc. Confidential Page 49 
Protocol HGS1012-C1103 Amendment 00  Mapatumumab 
 
 inventory must be kept and usage must be documented on study agent inventory forms 
provided by the sponsor. 
Study agent inventory forms will be examined  and reconciled by an unblinded Clinical 
Research Associate, or designee. At the end of the study, all used and unused study agent 
must be accounted for on a study agent accountability form provided to the investigator by 
Human Genome Sciences or its designee. 
10.8 Retention of Records 
The investigator shall retain  all records and source documents pertaining to the study, 
including any films, tracings, computer discs, or tapes. They will be retained for the longer of 
the maximum period required by the country and institution in which the study is conducted, 
or the period specified by the sponsor at the time the study is completed, terminated, or 
discontinued. 
If the investigator leaves the institution, the records shall be transfer red to an appropriate 
designee who accepts the responsibility for record retention. Notice of such transfer shall be 
documented in writing and provided to the sponsor. 
10.9 Financial Disclosure 
The investigator will provide Human Genome Sc iences sufficient and accurate information on 
financial interests (proprietary or equity interests,  payments exclusive of c linical trial costs) to 
allow complete disclosure to regulatory auth orities. The investigator shall promptly update 
this information if any relevant changes occur during the course of the investigation and for a 
period of 1 year following study completion. 
10.10 Publication Policy 
This study is being conducted as part of a multi -center clinical study. Data from all sites 
participating in the multi-center clinical study will be pooled and analyzed. The investigator 
acknowledges that an independent, joint publica tion is anticipated to be authored by the 
investigators of the multi-center study and spons or’s representatives. Neither institution nor 
principal investigator shall inde pendently publish or present the results of the study prior to 
the publication of the mu lti-center study publication. The inves tigator agrees th at the sponsor 
will be the coordinator and arb itrator of all multi-center stud y publications. For multi-center 
trials, no investigator will be authorized to publish study results from an individual center 
until the earlier of the multi-center  trial results are published or 12 months after the end or 
termination of the multi-center trial at all sites. 
The investigator shall submit a copy of any proposed publication, manuscript, abstract, 
presentation or other document with respect to this study to the sponsor for review and 
comment at least 60 days prior to its subm ission for publication or presentation. No 
publication or presentation with respect to th e study shall be made unless and until the entire 
sponsor’s comments on the proposed publication or presentation have been considered and 
any information determined by sponsor to be confidential information has been removed. 
Human Genome Sciences, Inc. Confidential Page 50 
Protocol HGS1012-C1103 Amendment 00  Mapatumumab 
 
 If requested in writing by the sponsor, the investigator shall withhold material from 
submission for publication or presen tation for an additional 60 days  to allow for the filing of a 
patent application or the taking of other meas ures to establish and preserve the sponsor’s 
proprietary rights. 
10.11 Study or Study Site Termination 
If Human Genome Sciences, the investigator, IRB/IEC, or a regulatory authority discovers 
conditions arising during the study  that indicate that the study should be halted or that the 
study center should be terminated, this action may be taken after appropriate consultation between Human Genome Sciences and the investigator. Conditions that may warrant termination of the study include, but are not limited to, the following: 
• The discovery of an unexpected, serious, or unac ceptable risk to the subjects enrolled in 
the study. 
• A decision on the part of Human Genome Sciences to suspend or discontinue testing, 
evaluation, or development of the product. 
 
The study site may warrant termination under the following conditions: 
• Failure of the investigator to enroll su bjects into the study at an acceptable rate. 
• Failure of the investigator to comply with pertinent regulatory authority regulations. 
• Submission of knowingly false information from  the research facility to Human Genome 
Sciences, study monitor, or  the regulatory authority. 
• Insufficient adherence to protocol requirements.

 Appendix 5 Response Ev aluation Criteria in So lid Tumors (mRECIST 
for HCC) 
(Adapted from Lencioni and Llove t, 2010 for use in this study) 
Measurable disease:  The presence of at least 1 target lesion, by contrast enhanced 
computerized tomography (CT) with use of mu ltislice scanners, or cont rast enhanced dynamic 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). 
Target lesion: Meets all the following criteria: 
- Located in the liver. 
- Can be accurately measured in at least 1 dimension. 
- Well-delineated area of viable, hypervascular (contrast enhancem ent in the arterial phase) 
tumor that is ≥  2 cm in the axial plane. 
- Suitable for repeat measurement. 
- Not previously treated with locoregional or systemic treatment unless the lesion shows a 
well-delineated area of viable (c ontrast enhancement in the arterial phase) tumor that is 
≥ 2 cm in the axial plane. (If the lesion is poorly demarcated or exhibits atypical 
enhancement as a result of the previous interven tion, then it cannot be selected as a target 
lesion). 
 A maximum of 5 target lesions may be selected. 
Nontarget lesion: Other lesions, including small lesions (< 2 cm in the axial plane). Note 
thatmalignant portal vein thrombosis should be  considered a nonmeasurable, and therefore 
nontarget, lesion. Lymph nodes at the portal hepa tic can be considered as malignant if the 
lymph node short axis is at least 2 cm. Inclusio n of effusion, notably ascities, as a nontarget 
lesion is discouraged. If effusion is selected as a nontarget lesion, it must be confirmed by 
cytopathologic confirmation. In addition, cyto pathologic confirmation of any effusion that 
appears or worsens is required when the target  lesion(s) have met criteria for response or 
stable disease. Measurement of lesions:  Imaging studies will be by contrast enhanced CT, with use of 
multislice scanners, or contrast enhanced MRI. The same method mu st be used at baseline and 
during follow up. Note that the longest diameter of the viable tumor is not necessarily located 
in the same scan plane in which the baseline diameter was measured. The measurement of the 
viable tumor diameter should not include any major intervening areas of necrosis. (Please see the HGS1012-C1103 Radiographic Data Collection Manual). 
Evaluation of target lesions: 
Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of intratumoral arterial enhancement in all target 
lesions. 
Human Genome Sciences, Inc. Confidential Page 64 
Protocol HGS1012-C1103 Amendment 00  Mapatumumab 
 
 Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of viable 
(enhancement in the arterial phase) target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of the diameters of target lesions. 
Stable Disease (SD): Any cases that  do not qualify for CR, PR or SD. 
Progressive Disease (PD): An incr ease of at least 20% in the su m of the diameters of viable 
(enhancing) target lesions, taking as referen ce the smallest sum of the diameters of viable 
(enhancing) target lesions reco rded since treatment started. 
Evaluation of nontarget lesions:  
Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of intratumoral arterial enhancement. Incomplete Response/Stable Disease (IR/SD):  Persistence of intratumoral arterial 
enhancement in 1 or more nontarget lesions. Progressive Disease (PD): Unequivocal prog ression of existing nontarget lesions.   
Evaluation of new lesions: A newly detected hepatic nodule will be classified as evidence of 
progression when its longest diameter is ≥ 1 cm and the nodule shows the 
hypervascularization in the arteri al phase with washout in the portal venous or late venous 
phase.   Liver lesions ≥ 1 cm that do not show a typical vascul ar pattern can be diagnosed as HCC by 
evidence of at least a 1 cm-interval growth in subsequent scans.  An individual radiologic event will be adjudicated in retrospect as progression at the time it 
was 1st detected  by imaging techniques, even if strict criteria were fulfilled only on subsequent 
radiologic testing. Evaluation of Overall Response:  The overall response is determined at each assessment and 
is a result of the combined assessment of ta rget lesions, nontarget le sions and new lesions.

 Best Overall Response : 
The best overall response is the best respons e recorded from the start of treatment until 
disease progression. To be as signed a best overall response of  CR or PR, changes in tumor 
measurements must be confirmed at the next scheduled disease assessment (no fewer than 
4 weeks after the initial documentation of PR or CR).

 Appendix 6 Exploratory Biomarker Sub-study 
1. Background 
Mapatumumab is a targeted therapy. Presently , the relationship between  expression of the 
target, TRAIL-R1, and the anti-tumor activity of the antibody is incompletely understood. 
Studies conducted with cell li nes derived from human tumors  have suggested that the 
relationship between receptor expression and mapatumumab-induced tumor cell death may be 
complex. However, studies of human tumor cells  in vitro and transplanted into animals may 
not accurately reflect the relationship between receptor expression and response to 
mapatumumab that may be observed in patients with cancer. One feature of this biomarker 
study is to compare TRAIL-R1 e xpression from available biopsy material. This could allow 
for a greater understanding of patterns of TRAIL-R1 expression in advanced hepatocellular 
carcinoma. 
It is also likely that other factors involved in TRAIL-R1 si gnaling could critically affect 
response to mapatumumab treatment. A 2nd goal of this biomarke r study is to evaluate 
biomarkers that may be potential indicators or  modifiers of response to mapatumumab. To 
identify factors that may indicate that a pa tient is responding to treatment, serum-based 
markers will be compared before and after treatment. To explore factors that are associated 
with the outcome of therapy and could be used prior to treatment to predict which patients will respond, somatic (inherited) differences th at modify a patient’s drug response will be 
examined. 
The information generated from this sub-study will be used solely for research purposes to 
improve future treatment with mapatumumab. It will not be used to change diagnoses or alter therapy. Participation in this sub-study is optional. 
2. Study Objectives and Design 
2.1. Indicators of Response 2.1.1. Serum-Based Markers of Response 
Induction of cell death in tumor cells can elicit the release of  certain biomarkers into the 
serum. These markers can be quantified to eval uate treatment effect. To assess release of 
biomarkers associated with cell death, serum- based assays will be conducted, including, but 
not limited to, assessments of M30, a fragment  of cytokeratin 18 that is generated by 
induction of programmed cell death in epithelial tissues. Other examples of markers of tumor 
cell death that will be examined include the cytokines TRAIL, TNF α, soluble Fas ligand, 
interferon α, interferon γ, interleukin-2, interleukin-6, in terleukin-8, interleukin-10, and 
interleukin-12. The levels of these factors will be  examined before and after treatment to see if 
they correlate with response to treatment. 
Serum will be isolated and the level of cytokines and other markers like M30 will be 
characterized. Collection, processing and ha ndling of these samples are described in the 
laboratory manual. 
Human Genome Sciences, Inc. Confidential Page 67 
Protocol HGS1012-C1103 Amendment 00  Mapatumumab 
 
 Samples collected in this study will be stored for up to 15 years and may be analyzed with 
samples collected in other studies, but will only  be used for mapatumumab-related research. 
2.2. Modifiers of Response 
2.2.1. Neoplastic Modifiers of Response 
Historically collected tumor biops y material, if available, will  be collected from subjects 
during Cycle 1. Samples will also be obtaine d from subjects who undergo a biopsy during the 
treatment period. Samples of resected tumor ti ssue that has been formalin-fixed and embedded 
in paraffin is acceptable; either tissue blocks or  slides may be provided. Frozen samples of 
tumor tissue may also be provided. Biopsy materi al collected from fine needle aspirates may 
be provided; either cell pellets or cytological slides are acceptable. 
Levels of TRAIL receptors will be assessed in biopsy material using immunohistochemical 
techniques if samples are available as form alin-fixed/paraffin-embedded tissue blocks or 
slides. Historically obtained biopsy material or biopsy material obtai ned during the treatment 
period that is in the form of fresh frozen tissue or cell pellet samples will be utilized to isolate 
RNA for analysis of TRAIL receptor gene expression. Similar techniques will be used to evaluate other potential biomarkers and factors that may 
influence mapatumumab response. These may in clude but are not limited to caspase 8, AKT 
and Mcl-1. 
See the laboratory manual for collection, processing and handling of these samples. 
Samples collected in this study will be stored for up to 15 years and may be analyzed with 
samples collected in other studies, but will only  be used for mapatumumab-related research. 
2.2.2. Somatic Modifiers of Response 
Inherited differences in the genes that code  for drug targets or components of signaling 
pathways related to the target can dramatically influence the effect of pharmacotherapy. 
Variations in genes that could potentially  impact mapatumumab’s activity, including 
polymorphic changes in the Fc gamma receptor and interleukin-6 promoter and K-Ras gene mutations, will be examined to see if they correlate with response to treatment. 
DNA will be isolated from the blood and polymorphisms and mutations in specific response-
related genes will be characte rized. Collection, processing and handling of these samples are 
described in the laboratory manual. 
Samples collected in this study will be stored for up to 15 years and may be analyzed with 
samples collected in other studies, but will only  be used for mapatumumab-related research.

 3. Statistical Analysis 
Associations will be assessed between candidate biomarkers and treatment outcomes captured 
in the clinical database. Statistical tests to  be performed may include Pearson chi-square 
testing, Fisher’s exact test, ANOVA and ANCO VA. Results of the biomarker sub-study may 
be reported independent of the results of HGS1012-C1103. 
4. Subject Selection and Withdrawal 
Subjects enrolled in the HGS1012-C1103 research study are given the option to participate in 
the Biomarkers Sub-study. A subject may withdraw from the sub-study at any time by contacting their Study Investigator, who will co ntact the sponsor. The sponsor will destroy 
any remaining sample materials an d will send a letter back to  the Investigator confirming 
sample destruction. Any data or  analysis generated from the sa mple prior to the request for 
destruction will not be destroyed. However, no new information will be generated from the 
sample and no new analysis will be performed. 
5. Confidentiality 
Information about sub-study subjects will be kept confidential and managed according to the 
requirements of local privacy regulations. Information obtained from samples will not be 
returned to subjects and will not be pl aced in the subject’s medical record. 
6. Ethical Considerations 
All subjects enrolled in the HGS1012-C1103 resear ch study who agree to participate in the 
Biomarker Sub-study will be asked to sign a se parate Biomarker Informed Consent. Choosing 
to not participate in this sub-study will not affect  the subject’s ability to participate in the main 
clinical trial. The Biomarker Informed C onsent will be submitted along with the main 
research study informed consent for review by the Institutional Review Board/Ethical 
Committee. 
7. Publication of Biomarker Results 
Any significant findings, based upon the analysis of aggregate data collected from this 
sub-study may be published by Human Genome Sc iences. Personal identifiers will not be 
used in any publication resu lting from this sub-study.

 Appendix 8 Treatment of Allerg ic/Hypersensitivity Reactions 
In the event of allergic/hypersensitivity reacti ons to mapatumumab/placeb o, investigators will 
institute treatment measures according to best  medical and nursing practice. The grading is 
based upon the NCI-CTCAE Version 4.0.0. 
The following treatment guidelines will be employed: 
• If chills and fever occur, the infusion w ill be interrupted. Subjects may be treated 
symptomatically and the infusion will be restarted at 50% of the original rate. 
 
Grade 1 allergic/hyper sensitivity reaction  (transient flushing or rash, drug fever < 38°C): 
• Decrease infusion rate by 50% and monitor for worsening condition. If the reaction 
worsens, stop the infusion. 
 Grade 2 allergic/hypersensitivity reaction  (rash, flushing, urticaria, dyspnea, drug fever 
< 38°C): 
• Stop the infusion. 
• Administer bronchodilators, oxygen, acetam inophen, etc as medically indicated. 
• Resume infusion at 50% of previous rate once reaction has decreased to ≤ Grade 1 in 
severity. Monitor closely for any worsening.  If the reaction recu rs, stop the infusion. 
 Re-treatment following Grade 1 or Grad e 2 allergic/hypersensitivity reactions: 
• Once the infusion rate has been decreased due to  an allergic/hypersensi tivity reaction, it 
will remain decreased for all subsequent infusions.  
• If the subject has a 2nd reaction at the lower infusion ra te, the infusion will be stopped and 
the subject will receive no further tr eatment with mapatumumab/placebo. 
• If the subject experiences a Grade 3 or Grad e 4 allergic/hypersensiti vity reaction at any 
time, the subject will receive no furthe r treatment with mapatumumab/placebo. 
• If there are questions concerning wh ether an observed reaction is an 
allergic/hypersensitivity of Grades 1-4, the medical monitor will be contacted immediately to assist with grading the reaction.  
 Grade 3 or Grade 4 allergic /hypersensitivity reaction: 
• A Grade 3 hypersensitivity reaction consis ts of symptomatic bronchospasm requiring 
parenteral medications with or without urticaria, allergy-related edema/angioedema, or 
asymptomatic hypotension not requiring treatment. 
• A Grade 4 hypersensitivity reaction (ie, anaphylaxis) is a life-threatening event 
characterized by the same symptoms as in a Grade 3 reaction but also complicated by 
symptomatic hypotension or oxygen saturation of 90% or less. 
 
Human Genome Sciences, Inc. Confidential Page 71 
Protocol HGS1012-C1103 Amendment 00  Mapatumumab 
 
 Treatment of Grade 3 or Grade 4 allergic/hypersensitivity reaction: 
• Stop the infusion immediately and disconnect infusion tubing from the subject. 
• Administer epinephrine, bronc hodilators, antihistamines, glucocorticoids, intravenous 
fluids, vasopressor agents, oxygen, etc, as medically indicated.

Study Design: This is a phase 1b/3, multicenter clinical trial. The study will be conducted in 
2 parts (phase 1b and phase 3).  In phas e 1b talimogene laherparepvec will be administered in 
combination with pembrolizumab to approximately 40 subjects with recurrent or metastatic SCCHN.  DLT will be evaluated based on the first 18 DLT -evaluable subjects.  An expansion 
cohort of an additional 22 treated subjects will be enrolled to further evaluate the safety and to 
estimate the efficacy of the combination of talimogene laherparepvec with pembrolizumab to support a decision to init iate the phase 3 study. The phase 3 is a multice nter, placebo- controlled, 
double- blind , randomized study  to evaluate the efficacy, as assessed by OS, of treatment with 
talimogene laherparepvec with pembrolizumab versus placebo with  pembrolizumab in subjects 
with recurrent or metastatic SCCHN.  Subjects will be randomized 1:1 to receive the following:   
- Arm 1:  talimogene laherparepvec plus pembrolizumab (n = 225)  
- Arm 2:  placebo plus pembrolizumab (n = 225)  
Randomization will be stratified by human papillomavirus ( HPV) status at baseline (HPV -negative 
versus HPV -positive)  and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 
(0 versus 1).

CONFIDENTIAL    All subjects  who receive investigational product  will complete a safety follow -up visit 
approximately 30 (+  7) days after the last dose of study treatment.  After the safety follow -up visit, 
all subjects will enter the long- term follow -up. Subjects will be followed for survival , subsequent 
anticancer therapies  and talimogene laherparepvec /placebo related adverse events every 
12 weeks from safety follow -up visit (± 28 days) for approximately 36 months after the last subject 
is enrolled .   
Sample Size:   Approximately 490 subjects will be enrolled in the study ; 40 in the phase 1b study 
and 450 in phase 3 Global Full Analysis Set (FAS[G]) .  
Summary of Subject E ligibility Criteria:   Subjects must be 18 years of age or older at the time 
of informed consent. Subjects must have histologically confirmed diagnosis of metastatic or 
recurrent SCCHN of the oral cavity, oropharynx, hypopharynx, or larynx , and disease must  be 
unsuitable for curative surgical resection and must not be amenable to curative radiotherapy. The disease must have progressed after treatment with a platinum -containing  regimen defined as 
either disease progression or recurrence between 3 to 6 months of prior curatively intended 
multimodal therapy including platinum therapy  for locoregionally advanced SCCHN  or disease 
progression or recurrence after prior platinum therapy in the recurrent or metastatic setting.   
Subjects with history of progression of disease within 3 months of completion of curatively 
intended treated for locoregionally advanced settings are excluded (note:  this exclusion criteria is only applicable for subjects who have not had treatment in the metastatic/recurrent setting).  The 
subject must be a candidate for intra lesional therapy . Subject must have radiographically 
measurable disease per RECIST v1.1 and have ECOG performance status of 0 or 1 and 
adequate organ function. Female subjects of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test. For a full list of eligibility criteria, please refer to Section 4.1 and 4.2. 
Investigational Product 
Amgen Investigational Product Dosage and Admini stration:  Talimogene laherparepvec  (or 
placebo in phase 3) will be administered into injectable cutane ous, subcutaneous, and nodal 
lesions with or without image ultrasound guidance.  Talimogene laherparepvec/placebo must not 
be administered into the mucos al surface of tumor lesions or visceral metastases.  See 
Section 6.2.1.1  for additional information regarding dosage and administration information.   
Phase  1b: 
The first dose of talimogene laherparepvec will be up to 8.0 mL of 10
6 PFU/mL.  The second 
injection, up to 8.0 mL of 108 PFU/mL, will be administered 3 weeks (+3 days ) after the initial 
injection (ie, no sooner than day 22 but should not be delayed more than 3 days after the 3 week 
time point).  All subsequent injections, up to 8.0 mL of 108 PFU/mL, will be administered every 
3 weeks (±3 days ). The maximum volume of talimogene laherparepvec administered at any dose 
is 4.0 mL for any individual tumor lesion.  The maximum volume in any treatment  visit is 8.0 mL.  
When talimogene laherparepvec  and pembrolizumab are administered on the same day,  it is 
recommended that  talimogene laherparepvec  be administered first.   Refer to Section 6.2.1. 
Phase 3:  
The initial dose of double- blind treatment is up to 8.0 mL of 106 PFU/mL talimogene 
laherparepvec/ placebo (talimogene laherparepvec formulation excipients as described in the 
Talimogene Laherparepvec Investigator’s Brochure).  The second dose up to 8.0 mL of 
108 PFU/mL talimogene laherparepv ec/placebo should be adminis tered 21  (+ 3)  days after the 
initial dose.  Subsequent doses up to 8.0 mL of 108 PFU/mL talim ogene laherparepvec/ placebo 
should be given every 3 weeks ( ± 3 days).   The maximum volume of talimogene 
laherparep vec/placebo administered at any dose is 4.0 mL for any individual tumor lesion.  The 
maximum volume at any treatment visit is 8.0 mL.   When talimogene laherparepvec/placebo and 
pembrolizumab are administered on the same day, it is recommended that talimoge ne 
laherparepvec/placebo be administered first.  
Non-Amgen Investigational Product Dosage and Administration:  Pembrolizumab will be 
manufactured by Merck. Pembrolizumab is supplied in 100 mg/4mL vials (25 mg/mL) solution for 
intravenous infusion.   
Product:  Talimogene Laherparepvec  
Protocol Number:  20130232  
Date:  11 May 2018  Page 6 of 158 
CONFIDENTIAL    Phase 1b/3:  
Pembrolizumab at a dose of 200 mg will be administered intravenously every 3  weeks ( ± 3 days).  
See Section 6.2.2.2  for additional information regarding dosage and administration of 
pembrolizumab.  
Procedure s:  Written informed consent must be obtained from all subjects before any study  
specific screening procedures are performed.  The following procedures will occur per the 
Schedule of Assessments  (Table 5 , Table 6 , and Table 7): medical, surgical and medication 
history, physical examination and vital signs, body weight, height, ECOG performance status , 
12-lead electrocardiogram ( ECG ), recording of concomitant medications, survival assessment, 
review of adverse events, disease related events and serious adverse events  as well as reporting 
of potential or known unintended exposure to talimogene laherparepvec /placebo by a household 
member , caregiver, or healthcare provider. Blood will be collected for local laboratory testing 
including: chemistry, hematology, prothrombin time ( PT) (seconds ) or international normalization 
ratio ( INR) (ratio) and partial thromboplastin time ( PTT) (seconds)  or activated PTT ( aPTT ) 
(seconds) , thyroid function , hepatitis  B surface antigen, hepatitis B core antibody and hepatitis C 
virus antibody .  Urine will be collected for urinalysis . In females of childbearing potential urine or 
serum pregnancy test will be performed locally . Additional blood or urine for  pregnancy testing 
(for women of child bearing potential)  may be performed at the investigator’s discretion or as 
defined in a country -specific protocol supplement at the end of the Appendix Section of the 
protocol as required by local laws and regulations. Central laboratory tests include:  blood for 
biomarker analysis, herpes simplex virus  type-1 (HSV-1) serostatus , anti-pembrolizumab 
antibodies  and pembrolizumab pharmacokinetics  (PK).  Tumor tissue from either the primary 
tumor or a metastatic lesion (block or unstained tumor slides)  and the associated pathology 
reports must be submitted within 28 days after enrollment  for phase  1b and within 28 days before 
randomization for phase 3 .  See Section  7.5.2 for more details.  A swab of all suspected herpetic 
lesion s will be collected for qPCR  testing.  Radiographic (computed tomography [ CT], pos itron 
emission tomography [ PET]/contrast enhanced CT or magnetic resonance imaging [ MRI]) scans 
and tumor assessment will also be performed. Biodistribution and shedding of talimogene 
laherparepvec will be performed in the phase 1b portion of the study  only.  Study treatment will be 
administered per Section 6.2. 
For a full list of study procedures, including the timing of each procedure, please refer to 
Section 7 and the Schedule of Assessments  (Table 5 , Table 6 , and Table 7).   
Statistical Considerations:   
Sample size consideration:  
For phase 1b, a maximum of 18 DLT -evaluable subjects will be enrolled to assess the DLT  profile 
of the combination therapy based on a sequential stopping rule.  If  > 18 subjects receive the 
combination they will contribute to the overall safety analysis, but only the first 18 DLT -evaluable 
will be considered in the decision to declare the combination safe.  Subjects may be replaced if they are not evaluable for DLT to obtain 18 DLT -evaluable subjects. An expansion cohort of up to 
an additional 22 treated subjects will be enrolled so there will be approximately 
40 treated subjects in total to estimate the efficacy of the combination of talimogene 
laherparepvec with pembrolizumab.  
For phase 3, the primary endpoint  is OS.  A hazard ratio ([HR] talimogene laherparepvec  with 
pembrolizumab vs placebo with pembrolizumab) of 0.7 for OS is hypothesized in the FAS(G).  
The overall 2-sided Type 1 error rate is  0.05.   The event goal for OS to achieve 90% power for a 
2-sided 0.05 significance level test is 336.  Assuming approximately 75% of subjects have an OS 
event at the time of OS primary analysis, the sample size is estimated to be 450 (225 per arm).  The OS event goal is adjusted for the interim efficacy analysis but not for the interim futility assessment; however, the power loss due to futility is < 1%  if consider ed binding.    
Planned method of analy ses: 
For the Phase 1b part of the study, the DLT analysis set will be used to summarize the subject incidence of DLT for the study and, unless specified otherwise,  the safety analysis set  (SAS)  will 
be used for all other analyses of safety endpoints including incidence of treatment -emergent and 
Product:  Talimogene Laherparepvec  
Protocol Number:  20130232  
Date:  11 May 2018  Page 7 of 158 
CONFIDENTIAL    treatment -related adverse events.  Summaries of the incidence of DLTs will be provided.  
Descriptive statistics will be provided for efficacy, safety, talimogene laherparepvec DNA, and 
biomarker endpoints as appropriate.  
Efficacy endpoints will be summarized using the Efficacy Analysis Set  (EAS)  and FAS .  The 
subject incidence for binary response endpoints  will be su mmarized with an associated 
95% confidence interval ( CI).  Duration of response (DOR) among responders , and other  
time-to-event endpoints  will be estimated using the Kaplan- Meier method.  
For the phase 3 part  of the study, efficacy analyses will be conducted on the  FAS(G).  Treatment 
effects on efficacy endpoints will be evaluated and compared between the 2 treatment arms 
according to the treatment as randomized.  
For analys is of the primary endpoint of OS, a stratified log- rank test will be used as the primary 
method for testing the null hypothesis of no treatment difference.  The randomization factors, along with programmed death- ligand 1 ( PD-L1) status at baseline (PD -L1 positive vs PD -L1 not 
positive) will be used as stratification factors.  A hazard ratio will be estimated using the Cox 
proportional hazards (PH) model stratified by the randomization factors per  interactive voice 
response ( IVR) system and PD -L1 status at baseline with Efron’s method ( Efron , 1977) used to 
handle ties.  Kaplan- Meier time to event curves will be presented based on randomized treatment 
arm. 
Statistical testing of OS , iORR, PFS,  and iPFS will follow the multiple hypothesis testing 
procedure described in Section 10.5.1. 
Two planned interim safety data reviews will occur after approximately 40 and 100 subjects have been enrolled in phase 3 and have had an opportunity to be followed up for at least 6 weeks after 
receiving study treatment.  An additional, planned interim safety data review will occur when at least 10 subjects have received at least one treatment with a total volume >  4 mL of 10
8 PFU/mL 
of talimogene laherparepvec plus pembrolizumab and have had the opportunity to be followed up to 6 weeks after receiving the > 4 mL of 10
8 PFU/mL dose of talimogene laherparepvec  and 
approximately every 6 months after the Data Monitoring Committee ( DMC ) meeting for the OS 
interim analysis.  An interim safety data review will also occur that includes the first 8 subjects 
enrolled with 3 or more randomized into treatment arm from Japan in the phase 3 part of the 
study and have had the opportunity  to be followed for at least 6 weeks after receiving study 
treatment .  Additional analyses may be conducted for Japan enrolled subjects as needed for 
regulatory or safety.  
An interim efficacy analysis for futility on OS will be conducted by the DMC when approximately 
280 events have occurred. .  The DMC will provide oversight of the analysis and indicate if the 
futility criterion  at the OS interim analysis has been met.   It is not planned for 
enrollment/randomization to be suspended during these ongoing phas e 3 safety analyses.  
For the phase  1b part of the study, the primary analysis will be repeated 1  year after the 
last subject enrolled.  
ORR and iORR will be summarized by treatment arm as randomized with associated 95% CIs, 
and with treatment comparisons based on the Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel test stratified by the 
randomization stratification factors  and PD -L1 status at baseline.  Analysis of PFS and iPFS  will 
follow the analysis described for the the primary endpoint of OS.  
In addition, CRR , iCRR, DCR and iDCR will be summarized by treatment arm as randomized with 
associated 95% CIs.  DOR and iDOR among responders will be summarized as a continuous 
variable.  
Safety data, including laboratory test results, vital signs , treatment -emergent adverse events , 
serious adverse event and disease related events , will be summarized by treatment received. 
Subject incidence of anti -pembrolizumab antibodies and serum concentration of pembrolizumab 
will be summarized.

CONFIDENTIAL    advanced SCCHN develop locoregional or distant relapses which are usually detected 
within the first 2 years of treatment  
(Argiris et al, 2008 ).  For this population, the prognosis is extremely poor with DCR 
estimating 45%, and median OS estimates of 6 to 9 months ( Vermorken et al, 2007).  
For distant met astases, the usual pattern of spread is to lung, liver, and bone, although 
this pattern may be different in HPV- positive disease which can spread to a range of 
other sites including intra -abdominal lymph nodes, pleural cavity, bowel and brain. 
Chemotherapy  is an integral part of the treatment of locally recurrent and metastatic 
SCCHN. Palliation is the main goal of treatment for patients with metastatic disease and locally recurrent disease not curable by radiation and/or surgery.  The current standard 
of care for locally recurrent and/or metastatic SCCHN is concurrent platinum -based 
chemotherapy in patients with good performance status without severe comorbidities.  The median OS is 7 to 10 months ( Cohen et al, 2004; Peron et al, 2014). In a phase  3 
randomi zed trial of patients with recurrent or metastatic SCCHN , cetuximab plus 
5-fluorouracil/cisplatin or 5- fluorouracil /carboplatin improved median OS compared to the 
standard of care chemotherapy doublet (10.1 months compared to 7.4 months 
[Vermorken et al, 2008]).  A similar trial design was employed for the SPECTRUM study, 
which evaluated panitumumab. Patients in both groups received up to six 3- weekly 
cycles of intravenous cisplatin (100 mg/m
2) and 5 -fluorouracil (1 g/m2 per day for 
4 days), while those in  the experimental group also received intravenous panitumumab. 
A total of 657 patients were randomi zed and the median overall survivals were 
11.1 versus 9.0 months (hazard ratio [HR] 0.873; P=0. 1403) in the panitumumab and 
control group, respectively ( Verm orken et al, 2013).  
After failure of first -line platinum based chemotherapy, cetuximab monotherapy in a 
phase 2 study demonstrated ORR 10% with a median OS of 5.8 months representing an 
increase of 2.5 months compared with platinum -refractory historical c ontrols 
(Vermorke n et al, 2007).  Objective response to second- line cytotoxic chemotherapy are 
uncommon with little impact on prolonging OS ( Leon et al, 2005 ).  Locally advanced, 
metastatic and recurrent SCCHN remains an area of high unmet medical need. 
Therefore , clinical evaluation of novel therapeutic approaches such as modulation of the 
immune system is needed.  
2.1.1  The Role of HPV  
Genetic material from high risk -oncogenic strains (HPV types 16 and 18) is found in 
approximately 60% of oropharyngeal cancers arising from the palatine and lingual tonsils

CONFIDENTIAL    (Ang et al, 2010).  Patients with locoregionally advanced HPV -positive oropharyngeal 
SCCHN treated with chemo radiation have better survival than do HPV -negative patients 
(Ang et al, 2010; Chaturvedi et al, 2011 ; Licitra et al, 2006).  The transforming potential 
of HPV infection is driven by viral proteins E6 and E7, which inactivate the tumor 
suppressor proteins p53 and pRb, which results in loss of cell cycle regulation, cellular 
proliferation, and chromosomal instability ( Fakhry and Gillison, 2006 ).  Squamous cell 
carcinoma of the head and neck patients with tumors that are HPV- positive have an 
improved survival compared with SCCHN patients who are HPV -negative.  A 
retrospective multivariate analysis of a randomized, phase 3 trial, Radiation Therapy 
Oncology Group 0129 originally designed to compare accelerated -fractionation to 
standard fractionation radiotherapy when delivered with concurrent cisplatin has been reported ( Ang et al, 2010 ).  This analysis revealed significantly improved 3- year survival 
among SCCHN patients who were HPV- positive compared with SCCHN patients who 
were HPV negative (84% vs. 57% respectively).  Patients with HPV -positive tumors had 
a 58%  reduction in risk of death compared with patient s with HPV -negative tumors 
(HR 0.42, 95% confidence interval [CI 0.27, 0.66] ).  In a multicenter Eastern Cooperative 
Oncology Group (ECOG) study in which patients with newly diagnosed stage III or IV SCCHN were treated with induction chemotherapy followed by chemoradiation, 60% of oropharynx primary tumors were found to be HPV -positive ( Fakhry et al, 2008).  The 
two-year PFS rate (86% vs.53%; p=0.02) and OS rate (95% vs. 62%; p=0.005) were 
also significantly better for patients with HPV -associated cancer co mpared to 
HPV-negative cancer.  Another retrospective analysis of the SEER ( Surveillance, 
Epidemiology, and End Results ) data for patients with oropharyngeal cancer revealed a 
4-fold higher median OS in patients who were HPV -positive compared with patients  who 
were  HPV-negative (131 months vs 20  months) ( Chaturvedi et al, 2011 ).  In contrast, the 
outcome for HPV -negative SCCHN patients has not improved despite intensification of 
standard chemotherapeutic agents and combinations.  Novel therapeutic approaches are needed in this population. 
2.1.2  Etiologies of SCCHN  
SCCHN is caused by the accumulation of multiple gene alterations modulated by genetic 
predisposition and chronic inflammation, enhanced by environmental influences such as tobacco and alcohol abuse (non -HPV related) or by infection with HPV  
(The Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2015).  These  etiologies involve a multistep 
process and result in alterations in both oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes.

CONFIDENTIAL    2.1.3  Programmed Cell Death- 1 (PD-1) in SCCHN 
Recently a new class of monoclonal antibodies has been engineered to block or activate 
co-signaling pathways resulting in enhanced anti -tumor immunity.  One of the most 
promising pathways for manipulation involves program death ligand 1 (PD -L1).  PD -L1 
expression is up regulated in solid tumors where it allows the tumor to evade attack by 
the immune system ( Dong et al, 2002 ; Hirano et al, 2005).  Inhibition of the interaction 
between PD -1 receptors (expressed on activated T cells) and PD -L1 has been shown to 
enhance T -cell r esponses ( Fife et al, 2009).  
Down -regulation of T- cells in SCCHN has been implicated in pathogenesis and 
progression of tumors ( Albers et al, 2010; Tong  et al, 2012 ;).  High levels of PD- 1 
expression have been demonstrated in human SCCHN tissue samples acr oss multiple 
primary sites ( Strome et al, 2003) on 46 % to 87% of tumors  
(Cho et al, 2011; Lyford -Pike et al, 2013 ; Strome et al, 2003; Ukpo et al, 2013).  While 
most studies have analyzed surgical samples from initial diagnosis, one evaluation of orophary ngeal squamous cell samples included 28 recurrent tumors and 10 distant 
metastases of which 43% and 70% expressed PD- L1 respectively ( Ukpo et al , 2013). 
PD-L1 expression was considered binarily positive in tumor cells if >5% staining (versus 
negative if 0 to 5% staining) . These data suggest PD -L1 is expressed on SCCHN in the 
primary, recurrent, and metastatic settings and manipulation of the PD -L1: PD -1 
pathway may be an important therapeutic target. 
Given the importance of HPV in the etiology of oropharyng eal SCCHN, several studies 
have examined the correlation between HPV status and PD -L1 status.  
Three independent studies have revealed higher expression of PD -L1 in HPV -positive 
compared to negative patients:  70 vs 29% ( Lyford -Pike et al, 2013), 49.2% vs 34.1% 
(Ukpo et al, 2013), and 62.5% vs 40% ( Badoual et al, 2013).  Additionally, a 12- gene 
chemokine signature identifying a subset of CD- 8 enri ched (T -cell enriched 
phenotype- high) tumors was developed in SCCHN tumors.  T -cell enriched high 
phenotypes (TCI P-H) were found in 51% of HPV -positive -tumors and in 21% of 
HPV-negative tumors indicating that the TCIP- H population may be a particularly 
important target in SCCHN ( Saloura et al, 2014).  
2.2 Amgen Investigational Product  Background : Talimogene 
Laherparepvec 
Talimogene laherparepvec is a virally -based oncolytic immunotherapy consisting of an 
immune- enhanced herpes simplex virus type- 1 (HSV -1) that selectively replicates in 
Product:  Talimogene Laherparepvec  
Protocol Number:  20130232  
Date:  11 May 2018  Page 30 of 158 
CONFIDENTIAL    tumors.  In this genetically modified strain, the HSV- 1 viral genes encoding infected -cell 
protein (ICP) 34.5 (a neurovirulence factor) and ICP47 (which blocks viral antigen 
presentation to major histocompatibility complex class I and II molecules) have been 
functionally deleted.  The coding sequence for human granulocyte macrophage colony -stimulating factor ( GM-CSF) have been inserted in place of ICP34.5 and is 
intended to enhance the immune response to tumor antigens released after virus replication and lytic tumor cell death.  Thus, talimogene laherparepvec has two mechanisms of action: (a)  direct oncolysis of infected tumor cells and (b) immune 
activation through tumor -associated antigen release and local virus -mediated GM -CSF 
expression.  Talimogene laherparepvec is administered by direct injection into tumors.  
Intralesional injection of talimogene laherparepvec, also known as IMLYGIC
, has been 
approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the local treatment of unresectable cutaneous, subcutaneous, and nodal lesions in adult patients with melanoma recurrent after initial surgery.  However, it has not been shown to increase OS or have an effect on metastases to internal organs including the liver and 
lungs.  Additionally, in the European Union, talimogene laherparepvec (Imlygic
TM) has 
been approved for the treatment o f adults with unresectable melanoma that is regionally 
or distantly metastatic ( stage  IIIB, IIC, and IVM1a) with no bone, brain, lung, or other 
visceral disease.  
As of 30 June 2015 , 15 clinical studies (including 2 extension studies) have been or are 
being  conducted in several advanced tumor types with over 400 subjects treated with 
talimogene laherparepvec .  For additional information, refer to the talimogene 
laherparepvec Investigator’s Brochure. 
Refer to the specific section of the Investigator’s Brochur e for additional information 
related to the physical, chemical, and pharmaceutical properties and formulation(s).  
Talimogene Laherparepvec in SCCHN 
A phase 1/2 study has been completed with talimogene laherparepvec in combination with radiotherapy and cisplatin in subjects with untreated stage III/IV SCCHN.  Seventeen subjects with stage III/IVA/IVB SCCHN were enrolled and received 
chemoradiotherapy (70 Gray [Gy]/35 fractions  with concomitant cisplatin 100 mg/m
2 on 
days  1, 22 and 43) and dose- escalating (106, 106, 106, 106 plaque -forming units 
(PFU)/mL for cohort 1; 106, 107, 107, 107 PFU/mL for cohort 2, 106, 108, 108, 
108 PFU/mL, for cohort 3) talimogene laherparepvec injected into malignant cervical

CONFIDENTIAL    lymph nodes on days 1, 22, 43, and 64. No injections were administered to mucosal 
surfaces of tumor lesions .  Injections were administered using topical local anesthetics 
with lidocaine/prilocaine.  Subjects underwent neck dissection 6 to 10  weeks later 
(Harrington et al , 2010).  The recommended phase 2 dose of  106, 108, 108, 108 PFU/mL 
was established.  Analysis of viral clearance of talimogene laherparepvec through 
biodistribution in blood and urine and shedding of live virus at various time points post injection was performed.  
All 17 subjects were treated without delays to chemoradiotherapy or DLT.  All subjects 
experienced at least 1 adverse event during the course of the study.  The most common treatment -emergent adverse events observed across 4 cohorts were decreased weight 
(16 subjects; 94%), constipation (15 subjects; 88%), mucosal inflammation and radiation skin injury (each 14 subjects; 82%), anemia and nausea (each 13 subjects; 76% each), and dysphagia (12 subjects; 71%).  The incidence of events was generally balanced across cohorts.  Most adverse events (86%) were Common Terminology Criter ia for 
Adverse Events (CTCAE) grade 1 or 2, and most (91.0%) were not considered related to talimogene laherparepvec by the investigator.  Thirteen (2.7%) adverse events considered related to talimogene laherparepvec were grade 1 and 12 (2.3%) events 
were grade 2.  There were no grade 3, grade 4, or grade 5 treatment -emergent adverse 
events considered related to talimogene laherpar epvec.  The most common grade 
3 adverse events were mucosal inflammation (6 subjects; 35%); radiation skin injury 
(5 subjects; 29%); weight decreased and dysphagia (each 4 subjects; 24%); dehydration 
and leukopenia (each 3 subjects; 18%); febrile neutropenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and nausea (each 2 subjects; 12%). Only three grade 4 adverse 
events were reported (lymphopenia, dysphagia, and respiratory failure).  None of these 
events were considered related to treatment.  
Sixteen of 17 subjects (94%) experienced treatment -emergent serious adverse events 
during the study.  The most commonly reported serious adverse events were mucosal inflammation (5 subjects; 29%), febrile neutropenia (3 subjects, 18%), and pyrexia, renal failure, nausea, dysphagia and dehydration (each 2 subjects; 12%) .  All serious adverse 
events were considered unrelated to talimogene laherparepvec by the investigator and all but 6 events (grade 3 skin graft infection, grade 3 ulcerative colitis, grade 2 mucositis and dysphagia, grade 3 urinary tract infection, and grade 3 dysphagia) resolved by end 
of study.  The ongoing events did not result in treatment discontinuation.

CONFIDENTIAL    Two subjects experienced events of febrile neutropenia and neutropenia, respectively 
that were considered DLTs; however neither event was considered related to talimogene laherparepvec.  The events of  neutropenia were considered related to cisplatin 
administration, and in both cases, the cisplatin dose was reduced and the events resolved.  No deaths or withdrawals due to adverse events occurred during the study.  
Three of 17 subjects (18%) had talimogene laherparepvec DNA detected by swab analysis of the injection site following talimogene laherparepvec administration.  This was detected in one subject at visit 0 (24 and 96 hours post injection, in another subject at visit 6 (48 hours post injection) and  at the end of study (24 hours post injection), and 
for a third subject in cohort 4 at visit 3 (24 hours post injection).  Swabs obtained from 
the dressings covering the injection site(s) were negative for the presence of virus for all subjects at all timepoints.  
Biopsy samples (3 from needle biopsy, 12 from neck dissection specimens, and 1 from both needle biopsy and neck dissection specimens) were obtained for analysis of 
talimogene laherparepvec copy number from injected and uninjected nodes in 16 of the 
17 subjects (94%).  Viral DNA was detected in 42% of injected nodes and in 
1 neighboring uninjected node (14%) suggesting virus replication and demonstrating 
spread of talimogene laherparepvec to an adjacent node.  In 31% of subjects, 
talimogene laherparepvec viral levels were >50,000 copies per microgram of DNA, a level suggestive of productive viral replication in tumors.  
The detection of virus in injected tumors at delayed time points after dosing appeared to be more likely at the highest dose administered.  Overall, 3 of 17 subjects (18%) had positive plaque assays of the tumor swab at any time point and no subjects had a 
positive plaque assay of the exterior dressing swab.  Urine and blood were not tested for 
viral shedding and biodistribution in this  study.  
Fourteen subjects (82.3%) showed tumor response by RECIST v1 .1, and pathologic 
complete remission was confirmed in 93% of subjects  at neck dissection.  No subject 
developed locoregional recurrence, and disease-specific survival was 82.4% at a median follow -up of 29 months ( Harrington et al, 2010).

TM [US]), a humanized monoclonal antibody against  the PD-1 
protein, has been developed by Merck & Co for the treatment of cancer.  Pembrolizumab is approved for treatment of melanoma in several countries; in the US and EU it is

Protocol Number:  20130232  
Date:  11 May 2018  Page 33 of 158 
CONFIDENTIAL    approved for the treatment of advanced (unresectable or metastatic) melanoma in 
adults.  Pembrolizumab has also been approved for treatment of non-sma ll cell lung 
cancer ( NSCLC) in several countries; in the US it is indicated for the treatment of 
patients with metastatic NSCLC whose tumors express PD -L1 as determined by an 
FDA-approved test and who have disease progression on or after platinum -containing 
chemotherapy.  Patients with NSCLC and EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations 
should also have disease progression on FDA -approved therapy for those aberrations  
prior to receiving pembrolizumab.    
Most recently, pembrolizumab has gained approval for the treatment of patients with 
locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma who have disease progression during or following platinum -containing chemotherapy or within 12 months of 
neoadjuvant or adjuvant treatment with platinum- containing chemotherapy.  
Pembrolizumab has also gained accelerated conditional approval  in the United States  
and several countries in the EU in the second line setting for recurrent/metastatic 
SCCHN with disease progression on or after platinum containing chemotherapy without 
any biomarker testing requirement based on the updated data of the phase 1b 
KEYNOTE- 012 study  ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) .  
Mostly recently, pembrolizumab has further gained accelerated approval based on tumor response rate and durability of response in following tumor types:  (1) adult and pediatric patients with refractory classical Hodgkin lymphoma ( cHL), or who have relapsed after  3 
or more prior lines of therapy; (2) urothelial carcinoma in locally advanced or metastatic  
setting for pts who are not eligible for cisplatin containing chemotherapy ; (3) adult or 
pediatric patients with unresectable or metastatic, microsatellite instability -high (MSI -H) 
or mismatch repair deficient solid tumors that have progressed following prior treatment and who have no satisfactory alternative treatment options, or colorectal cancer that has progressed following treatment with a fluoropyrimidine, oxaliplatin, and irinotecan.  Continued approval for above indications may be contingent upon verification description of clinical benefit in the confirmatory trials.  
Note:  The safety and effectiveness of pembrolizumab in pediatric patients with MSI -H 
central nervous system cancers have not been established.  
Pembrolizumab also has demonstrated initial clinical efficacy in single arm monotherapy 
trials in cluding subjects with gastric cancer, triple negative breast cancer, and Hodgkin’s 
Lymphoma as determined by response rate.  Ongoing clinical trials are being conducted

CONFIDENTIAL    in other tumor types including hematologic malignancies.  For study details, please refer 
to the pembrolizumab Investigator’s Brochure.  
The first dose -escalation phase 1 study involving subjects with solid tumors showed that 
pembrolizumab was safe at the dose levels tested (1 mg/ kg of body weight, 3  mg/kg, 
and 10 mg/kg, administered every 2 weeks) without reaching a maximum tolerated dose  
(Hamid et al,  2013) .  In addition, clinical responses were observed at all the dose levels 
(Patnaik et al, 2012 ).   
For additional information, refer to the pembrolizumab Investigator’s Brochure. 
Pembrolizumab in SCCHN 
On 08 August 2016, pembrolizumab gained accelerated conditional approval in the United States  and several countries in the EU in the second line setting for 
recurrent/metastatic SCCHN based on the r esults of a pooled analysis of 
2 recur rent/metastatic squamous cell carcinoma head and neck cohorts from 
KEYNOTE 012 ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]).  In one cohort, subjects with positive PD -L1 expression 
(defined as a proportion score of >  1% PD -L1 immunohistochemistry expression in 
tumor cells or stroma) rec eived pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks.  In a second 
cohort, subjects with both positive and negative PD -L1 expression received 
pembrolizumab 200 mg every 3 weeks.  The evaluable population (n  = 173) was 
heterogeneous in terms of numbers of prior lines  of therapy; however, most patients had 
received prior platinum therapy.  The ORR in the entire population was 23.7% (24.1% in 
the HPV -negative subset and 23.6% in the HPV -positive s ubset).  The median PFS was 
2.2 months (95% CI:  2.0  to 3.6) and the median overall survival was reported to be 
9.6 months (95% CI:  6.6 to not reached).   Treatment was well tolerated with grade  3/4 
drug-related adverse events occurring in 12.5% of patients  (Chow et al, 2015). 
A phase 2 clinical trial of single agent pembrolizumab in platinum and cetuximab failure subjects is currently being conducted ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]).  The primary endpoint will be ORR by RECIST v1.1. A  phase 3 clinical trial of pembrolizumab versus standard of care 
(methotrexate, docetaxel, or cetuximab) in recurre nt or metastatic SCCHN subjects after 
treatment with platinum -based cetuximab therapy is being conducted  ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) 
with primary endpoint of OS.  A third study of pembrolizumab alone versus 
pembrolizumab plus platinum plus 5-Fluorouracil versus cetuximab plus platinum plus 
5-Fluorouracil  for first line treatment of recurrent or metastatic SCCHN is currently being 
conducted ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) .  The primary endpoint of this study will be PFS by

Protocol Number:  20130232  
Date:  11 May 2018  Page 35 of 158 
CONFIDENTIAL    RECIST  v1.1.  For all three studies, subjects will receive pembrolizuma b 200 mg 
intravenously on Day 1 of each 3 week cycle.  
As existing data suggest 200 mg every 3 weeks as the appropriate dose for 
pembrolizumab and pembrolizumab is currently being tested at this fixed dose in 
ongoing head and neck cancer studies, this is the dose of pembrolizumab planned to be 
studied in this trial.  
2.4 Rationale  
Talimogene laherparepvec and pembrolizumab blockade likely play complementary 
roles in regulating adaptive immunity.  Talimogene laherparepvec likely augments dendritic cell -mediat ed tumor antigen presentation through local expres sion of GM -CSF 
(Kaufman et al, 2010) and local antigen release by direct tumor lysis. PD -1 plays an 
important role in SCCHN. Pembrolizumab is a PD -1 regulator and prevents T -cell 
exhaustion in peripheral tissues.  After evidence of activity in SCCHN, pembrolizumab is being evaluated in 2 phase 3 trials.  
The combination of an agent that increases tumor -specific immune activation 
(talimogene laherparepvec) with one that blocks inhibitory T -cell checkpoints 
(pembrolizumab) could produce greater antitumor activity than either agent alone.   
There are currently 2  ongoing combination immunotherapy studies with talimogene 
laherparepvec and a checkpoint inhibitor in advanced stage melanoma.  The first is a phase 1b/2 study of ipilimumab with or without talimogene laherparepvec in unresected 
melanoma ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]).  In the phase  1b portion, 18 of 19 subjects (more than half 
with stage IV M1b disease) received both talimogene laherparepvec and ipilimumab in 
combination.  Full dose of talimogene laherparepvec  and ipilimumab 3 mg/kg every 
3 weeks starting at week  6 were tolerable.  Per immune- related response criteria (data 
cutoff of 22  December  2014), the ORR in 18 evaluable subjects was 56% 
(33%  complete responses [CRs]), and the durable response rate ( DRR) was 44%.  
Median PFS was 10.6 months (2.6 to 19.3+ months).   Median OS was not reached; 
12-month and 18- month survival rates were 72.2% and 67%, respectively.  On a lesion 
level,  8 and 5 of 16 uninjected index lesions  regressed ≥  50% and 100%, respectively.  
Grade 3/4 treatment -emergent A occurred in 32% of  subjects, and grade  3/4 
immune- related adverse events occurred in 2  subjects (grade  3 hypophysitis and 
adrenal insufficiency; and grade  4 amylase + lipase elevations).  There were no 
treatment -related deaths ( Puzanov  et al, 2014).  More recently, an interim analysis of the 
phase 2 portion of the study which was performed when 82 patients had ≥ 48 weeks of

CONFIDENTIAL    follow up was reported ( Chesney et al, 2016).  One-hundred and seventy three subjects 
were randomized:  88 in the talimogene laherparepvec + ipilimumab arm and 85 in the 
ipilimumab arm.  Characteristics for all subjects were similar:  54% stage IIIB -IVM1a, 
45% IVM1b/c.  Median follow up time for 82 subjects was 61.2  weeks 
(range:  0.14-113.9).  Confirmed ORR was 35.7% in the combination arm and 17.5% in 
the ipilimumab arm with odds ratio for response of 2.6 (95% CI; 0.9- 7.3).  Unconfirmed 
ORR was 50% in the combination arm and 27.5% in the ipilimumab arm.  Safety data in 
the analysis were as expected based on the phase 1b data; of 165 subjects in the safety set (85 in the combination arm and 80 in the ipilimumab arm), the incidences of grade  3 
and 4 treatment related adverse event s were similar in both arms (total of 20% in the 
combination arm and 19% in the ipilimumab arm) with the exception of diarrhea (4% in combination arm vs 0% in ipilimumab arm) and colitis (4% in combination arm vs 8% in ipilimumab arm).  A grade 5 autoimmune hepatitis occurred in the combination arm 
which was attributed to ipilimumab per investigator.  
The second study is a phase 1b/3 multicenter open- label trial of talimogene 
laherparepvec in combination with pembrolizumab for treatment of unresected, stage IIb to IVM1c melanoma ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]).  In the phase 1b portion of the study, subjects with 
stage IIB -IV melanoma with injectable lesions and no prior systemic therapy received up 
to 4.0  mL of talimogene laherparepvec monotherapy for 2  doses followed by talimogene 
laherparepvec and pembrolizumab every 2  weeks thereafter.  All 21 evaluable subjects 
had an adverse event:  29% grade 3, no grade  4 and 1 grade 5 (not treatment related).  
The most common adverse events by preferred term were fatigue (52%), pyrexia (48%), 
chills (43%), and rash (38%).  Of 16 subjects evaluable for response, the unconfirmed 
response rate per investigator was 56%; DCR was 69% (12.5% CR, 44% partial 
response [ PR], 12.5%  stable disease [ SD]) (Long et al, 2015 ). 
This registrational study is intended to provide evidence that a r egimen of an oncolytic 
immunotherapy (talimogene laherparepvec) and a checkpoint inhibitor (pembrolizumab) is safe and tolerable, and that the combination might enhance the clinical efficacy of single agent pembrolizumab in recurrent or metastatic SCCHN.  The choice of PD -1 
inhibitors for the control arm is based on the assumption that this class of agent  may 
becom e the new standard of care in this indication.   The study is an accelerated design 
leading from a phase 1b to a phase 3 study without a conventional phase 2 evaluation. 
However, activity of the combination will be evaluated at the end of the phase 1b study 
to support a decision to initiat e the phase 3 study.

CONFIDENTIAL    2.5 Clinical Hypotheses 
Phase 1b:  
Talimogene laherparepvec in combination with pembrolizumab will be safe and well 
tolerated in subjects with recurrent or metastatic SCCHN . 
Phase 3:  
The clinical hypothesis is that talimogene laherparepvec with pembrolizumab compared to placebo with pembrolizumab will improve OS.  In addition to the hypothesis test for 
the primary endpoint, ORR,  PFS, iORR, and i PFS in subjects given talimogene 
laherparepvec plus pembrolizumab versus placebo plus pembrolizumab will be 
compared . 
3. EXPERIMENTAL PLAN  
3.1 Study Design 
This is a phase 1b/3, multicenter clinical trial.  The study  will be conducted in 2 parts 
(phase 1b and phase 3) as described below.  The overall study design is described by a 
Study Design and Treatment Schema  at the end of the protocol  synopsis section.  
The study endpoints are defined in Section 10.1.1 . 
3.1.1  Phase 1b Study Design 
Phase 1b is a  multicenter, single -arm study.  Talimogene laherparepvec will be 
administered in combination with pembrolizumab to approximately 40 subjects with 
recurrent or metastatic SCCHN.  DLT will be evaluated based on first 18 DLT -evaluable 
subjects.  An expansion cohort of up to an additional 22 treated subjects will be enrolled 
to obtain a total of approximately 40 treated subjects  to further evaluate the safety and to 
estimate the efficacy of  the combination of talimogene laherparepvec with 
pembrolizumab to support a decision to initiate the phase 3 study.  
3.1.1.1  Rules for DLT Evaluation in Phase 1b  
A Dose Level Review Team (DLRT) will review the safety data to evaluate DLT.  This 
team will recommend either to enroll more subjects for DLT evaluation in phase 1b, to 
prematurely stop enrollment into phase 1b, or to declare that the combination is tolerable based on the criteria described in Table 1  below.  
The DL T evaluation period is 6 weeks from the initial administration of study treatment.  
To be evaluable for a DLT, subjects must have had the opportunity to be on treatment 
for at least 6 weeks from the initial dosing of study treatment and have received at least 
2 doses of talimogene laherparepvec and 2 doses of pembrolizumab in combination, or

CONFIDENTIAL    have a DLT during the DLT evaluation period after at least 1 dose of talimogene 
laherparepvec and pembrolizumab in combination.  Subjects may be replaced if they are not evaluable for DLT to obtain 18 DLT- evaluable subjects (eg, a subject did not receive 
study treatment, or ended the study treatment before completion of DLT evaluation period for a reason other than experiencing a DLT).  
Safety will be evaluated considering the incidence of DLTs among all DLT- evaluable 
subjects enrolled in the phase 1b.  A sequential stopping rule is derived based on a hypothesis testing approach considering only the first 18 DLT-evaluable subjects 
(Goldman, 1987).   There will be up to 3 planned safety interim analyses.  The cumulative 
increments of DLT- evaluable subjects and corresponding acceptable maximum number 
and percentage of DLTs at each analysis are indicated in Table  1.  The combination wil l 
not be declared safe if the number of DLTs exceeds the acceptable maximum number and phase 1b will stop.

The design achieves a 7.7% 1 -sided significance level and 81.6% power to test the null hypothesis of a DLT 
rate ≤ 10% versus the alternative hypothesis of a rate ≥ 33%.  
1 Although the target is 4 to 6 DLT -evaluable subjects at Analysis #1, and 4 to 6 new subjects at Analysis 
#2, all DLT -evaluable subjects will be included in each analysis.  
2 If > 18 subjects receive the combination they will contribute to the overall safety analysis, but only the first 
18 DLT -evaluable will be considered in the decision to declare the combination safe.  
3.1.1.2  Definition of DLT  in Phase 1b  
All toxicities will be graded using the CTCAE version 4.0  (Appendix  A). 
The occurrence of any of the following toxicities during DLT evaluation period 
(ie, 6-week period from the initial administration of talimogene laherparepvec and 
Product:  Talimogene Laherparepvec  
Protocol Number:  20130232  
Date:  11 May 2018  Page 39 of 158 
CONFIDENTIAL    pembrolizum ab in combination) will be considered a DLT, if judged by the investigator to 
be related to the administration of talimogene laherparepvec and/or pembrolizumab:  
• Grade 4 non -hematologic (non -laboratory) toxicity  
• Grade 3 or higher pneumonitis  
• Grade 3 non -hematologic (non-laboratory) toxicity lasting > 3 days despite optimal 
supportive care 
• Grade 3 fatigue will not be classified as DLT, irrespective of duration  
• Any grade 3 or higher non- hematologic laboratory value if:  
− medical intervention is required, or  
− the abnormality leads to hospitalization, or 
− the abnormality persists at grade 3 or higher for >1 week  unless  deemed not 
clinically important per both investigator and sponsor  
• Grade 3 or grade 4 febrile neutropenia 
• Thrombocytopenia < 25 x 109/L associated wit h bleeding event requiring intervention 
• Serious herpetic event:  
− Herpetic encephalitis, encephalomyelitis, or disseminated herpetic infection 
• Grade 5 toxicity (ie, death)  
• Any other intolerable toxicity leading to  permanent discontinuation of talimogene 
laherparepvec or pembrolizumab  
If a subject experiences a DLT during the DLT evaluation period, study treatments will 
be discontinued for that subject. 
An expansion cohort of up to 22 treated subjects will be enrolled so there will be 
approximately 40 treated  subjects in total to estimate the efficacy of the combination of 
talimogene laherparepvec with pembrolizumab.   
3.1.2  Phase 3 Study Design 
Phase 3 is a multicenter, placebo- controlled, double- blind , randomized trial to evaluate 
the efficacy, as assessed by OS, o f treatment with talimogene laherparepvec with 
pembrolizumab versus placebo with pembrolizumab in subjects with recurrent or 
metastatic SCCHN.  Approximately 450 subjects will be randomized 1:1 to receive the 
following:  
• Arm 1:  talimogene laherparepvec  plus pembrolizumab  
• Arm 2:  placebo plus pembrolizumab 
Randomization will be stratified by HPV status at bas eline (HPV - negative versus 
HPV-positive)  and ECOG performance status (0 versus 1).

CONFIDENTIAL    3.1.3  Tumor Assessment  
3.1.3.1  Eligibility Assessment  
Phase 1b 
Conventional RECI ST v1.1 (Eisenhauer et al, 2009) , with the following modification, will 
be used by the investigator to determine eligibility : 
• Increased total target lesions to a maximum of 10 (up to a maximum of 5 per 
organ)  
Phase 3 
Conventional RECIST  v1.1 (Eisenhauer et al, 2009) with no modifications  will be used 
by the investigator to determine eligibility.  
3.1.3.2  Response Assessment  
For both phase  1b and phase 3, a variation of RECIST v1.1, irRECIST , will be used by 
the investigator to assess tumor response and make treatment decisions , and to assess 
the secondary tumor response related endpoints in the phase  1b and phase 3 portions 
of the study .  In addition, for phase  3 only, investigators will also be asked to determine 
and document tumor responses per standard RECIST v1. 1, although treatment 
decisions should NOT be made based on RECIST v1.1.  Details  for irRECIST  can be 
found in Appendix  D, and details for RECIST v1.1 can be found in Appendix E. 
Radiographic tumor assessments will be performed independent of treatment cycle at 
week 9 (±1 week), week 18 (±1 week), and then every 9 weeks (± 1 week) or more 
frequently if clinically indicated until confirmed progressive disease per irRECIST  (iPD) 
or start of a new anticancer treatment.  Radiographic  tumor assessments should not be 
adjusted for cycle initiation delays and performed according to the calendar.  
Radiographic tumor imaging assessment at screening (baseline) (computed tomography 
[CT] scan, positron emission tomography [PET]/contrast enhanced CT scan, or magnetic 
resonance imaging [MRI ]) must include the neck, chest, abdomen and all other sites of 
disease.  A  CT scan or MRI of the brain should only be performed if signs or symptoms 
suggestive of central nervous system [ CNS ] metastases  are present . The imaging 
modality selected (eg, CT or MRI) should remain constant for any individual subject.  
3.1.4  Follow -up 
3.1.4.1  Safety Follow -up 
All subjects who receive investigational product will complete a safet y follow -up visit 
approximately 30 (+7) days after the last dose of study treatment.  Adverse events and

Protocol Number:  20130232  
Date:  11 May 2018  Page 41 of 158 
CONFIDENTIAL    disease related events will be collected as described in Section 9.2.  Serious adverse 
events and any concomitant medications associated with serious adverse events 
observed by  the investigators or reported by the subjects that occur through 
90 (+7) days after the cessati on of all study treatment or 30 (+7) days following 
cessation of treatment if the subject initiates new anticancer therapy , whichever is 
earlier , will be reported to Amgen and recorded in the CRF.  
3.1.4.2  Long- term Follow -up 
After the safety follow -up visit, all subjects will enter the long -term follow -up. Subjects will 
be followed for survival and subsequent anticancer therapies every 12 weeks 
(± 28 days) from safety follow -up for approximately 36 months after the last subject is 
enrolled.   In addition, talimogene laherparepvec /placebo related adverse events that 
occur through the end of the long -term follow -up will be reported.  
For subjects who discontinue study treatment without documented iPD and have not 
initiated a new anticancer therapy , every effort should be made to continue monitoring 
tumor response status by clinical and radiographic tumor assessments, and to complete PRO questionnaires  as described in Section 7.7.   
3.2 Number of Sites  
The study will be conducted at approximately 140 si tes in Australia, Europe, 
North  America , Latin America, Asia, and other regions. Additional sites and countries 
may be added.  Sites that do not enroll subjects within approximately 4 months of site 
initiation may be closed.   
3.3 Number of Subjects  
Participants in this clinical investigation shall be referred to as “subjects”.  
Approximately 490 subjects will be enrolled in this study: approximately 40 subjects will 
be enrolled in phase 1b and approximately 450 subjects will be enrolled in phase 3 
Global Full Analysis Set (FAS[G]) .  Refer to Section 10.2 for sample size considerations.  
3.4 Replacement  of Subjects 
Subjects enrolled in phase 1b may be replaced if they are not evaluable for DLT (eg, a subject did not receive study treatment, or ended the study treatment before 
completion of DLT evaluation period for a reason other than experiencing a DLT).   
Subjects enrolled in phase 3 who are withdrawn or removed from treatment or from the study will not be replaced.

CONFIDENTIAL    3.5 Estimated Study Duration 
3.5.1  Study Duration for Subjects 
The duration of screening for each subject will be approximately 28 days.  The duration 
of treatment will vary for each subject.  Subjects enrolled (phase 1b)/randomized 
(phase 3) have an estimated median treatment period of 7 months, but can be treated 
for up to 24  months.  All subjects will complete a safety follow -up visit approximately 
30 (+7) days after the last dose of study treatment .  After the safety follow -up visit 
subjects will enter the long- term follow -up.  During this period, subjects will be followed 
for survival for approximately 36 months after the last subject is enrolled .  The study 
duration for an individual subject is expected to be 45 months.  The actual duration of the study for an individual subject may vary depending  upon the time required to reach 
the study specified number of OS events.  
3.5.2  End of Study  
Primary Completion :  The primary completion date is defined as the date when the 
last subject is assessed or receives an intervention for the final collection of data 
for the primary endpoint(s), for the purposes of conducting the primary analysis, 
whether the study concluded as planned in the protocol or was terminated early.   
If a study concludes prior to the primary completion date originally planned in the protocol (ie, early termination of the study), then the primary completion will be 
the date when the last subject is assessed or receives an intervention for evaluation in the study (ie, last subject last visit).  
Primary Completion Phase 1b only:   The time when the last phase 1b subject is 
assessed or receives an intervention for the purposes of final collection of data for the primary efficacy endpoint of phase  1b.  The primary completion is 
anticipated to occur when the last phase  1b subject completes the week 9 tumor 
response assessment.  
End of Study  (end of trial) :  The  end of study date is defined as the date when the 
last subject  across all sites is assessed or receives an intervention for evaluation in the 
study  (ie, last subject last visit), following any additional parts in the study (eg, 
long- term follow -up), as applicable.   This is anticipated to occur 36 months after 
the last subject is enrolled.

5. SUBJECT ENROLLMENT  
Before subjects begin participation in any  study -specific activities/procedures, Amgen 
requires a copy of the site’s written IRB/IEC  approval of the protocol, informed consent 
form, and all other subject information and/or recruitment material, if applicable 
(see Section 11.2).  All subjects must personally sign and date the IRB/IEC and Amgen 
approved informed consent form before commencement of study -specific 
activit ies/procedures.   
A subject is considered enrolled when the investigator decides that the subject has met 
all eligibility criteria.  The investigator is to document this decision and date, in the 
subject’s medical record and in/on the enrollment case report form ( CRF). 
Each subject who enter s into the screening period for the study ( defined w hen the 
subject signs the informed consent)  receives a unique subject identification number 
before any study -related activities /procedures are performed.  The subject identification

Protocol Number:  20130232  
Date:  11 May 2018  Page 49 of 158 
CONFIDENTIAL    number will be assigned by the Interactive  voice response ( IVR) system (referred to as 
IxRS throughout the protocol) .  This number will be used to identify the subject 
throughout the clinical study and must be used on all study documentation related to that 
subject.    
The subject identification number must remain constant throughout the entire clinical 
study; it must not be changed after initial assignment, including if a subject is 
rescreened.  This number will not necessarily be the same as the randomization number 
assigned for the study.  
5.1 Treatment Assi gnment Phase 1b 
All subje cts enrolled in the phase 1b of the study will receive open- label talimogene 
laherparepvec in combination with pembrolizumab.  The treatment assignment date is to 
be documented in the subject’s medical record and on the enrollment CRF.  
5.2 Randomization/Treatm ent Assignment  Phase 3  
Upon confirmation of eligibility, the site staff will use the IVR system to  randomize a 
subject.  The IVR system will assign a randomization number. Approximately 
450 subjects will be randomized 1:1 ratio to receive the following:  
• Arm 1:  talimogene laherparepvec plus pembrolizumab  
• Arm 2:  placebo plus pembrolizumab 
Randomization will be stratified by HPV status at bas eline (HPV - negative versus 
HPV-positive)  and ECOG performance status (0 versus 1).   
Following randomization via the IVR system, study treatment must commence within  
5 days  after enrollment . 
The randomization date is to be documented in the subject’s medical record and on the 
enrollment CRF.  
The subject, site person nel, and sponsor  study personnel and designees are blinded to 
the randomization treatment group assigned unless otherwise specified in the protocol.   
A subject’s treatment assignment should only be unblinded when knowledge of the treatment is essential for the further management of the subject on this study .  If a 
subject discontinues study treatment due to documented disease progression and the knowledge of treatment assignment alters the subject’s eligible treatment options outside 
of the trial, then the investigator may request to unblind the treatment as signment for 
that subject after discussion with the sponsor.  All precaution and efforts will be taken to

Protocol Number:  20130232  
Date:  11 May 2018  Page 50 of 158 
CONFIDENTIAL    ensure the sponsor and blinded site personal will remain blinded to the study treatment.  
Unblinding at the study site for any other reason will be considered a protocol deviation.  
The investigator is strongly encouraged to contact the sponsor clinical study manager before unblinding any subject’s treatment assignment, but must do so within 1 working 
day after the event  and must document the unblinding in the subject’s electronic CRF.

CONFIDENTIAL  
  Talimogene laherparepvec or placebo may be supplied as open-label or blinded.  Where 
talimogene laherparepvec or placebo is supplied as open-label, the site pharmacist or 
designee will need to be unblinded to prepare blinded talimogene 
laherparepvec/placebo. 
 For talimogene laherparepvec or placebo supplied as open-label investigational 
medicinal product, IxRS will confirm to the unblinded site pharmacist or designee, 
from which lot number(s) the vial(s) should be selected from each dosing visit.  In 
no circumstances should an unblinded pharmacist reveal the treatment 
assignment to the other site staff. 
 For talimogene laherparepvec or placebo supplied as a blinded investigational 
medicinal product, IxRS will confirm to the site pharmacist or designee from which 
box number(s) vial(s) should be selected from each dosing visit.  All site 
personnel will be blinded to study treatment. 
6.2.1.1 Dosage, Administration, and Schedule 
Talimogene laherparepvec/placebo must be prepared and administered by a qualified 
healthcare professional.  Subjects should be assessed clinically for adverse 
events/toxicity prior to each dose using the CTCAE version 4 ( Appendix A ).  Complete 
blood count with differential and chemistry panels including liver function laboratory tests 
(ALT, AST, and total bilirubin) should be obtained according to the Schedule of 
Assessments ( Table 5  and Table 7 ) and the results should be checked before each 
treatment.   For subjects on anticoagulant therapy, close monitoring of coagulation 
parameters is recommended during the study treatment phase.   Dosing will occur only if 
these test values are acceptable per Section 6.2.1.2. 
Talimogene laherparepvec/placebo will be administered by intralesional injection only 
into injectable cutaneous, subcutaneous, and nodal tumors, with or without image 
ultrasound (US) guidance.  Talimogene laherparepvec/placebo must not be 
administered into the mucosal surface of tumor lesions or visceral metastases.   For 
subjects with tumor(s) which directly contacts or encases a major vessel but does not 
have ulceration and/or fungation onto the skin surface, talimogene laherparepvec 
injections should be given no closer than 2 cm from the wall of the major vessel.  This 
should be done under image guidance and by skilled personnel (eg, a surgeon). 
For the first cycle, the dose of talimogene laherparepvec/placebo will be up to 8.0 mL o f 
106 PFU/mL administered on week 0, d ay 1.  For the second cycle, subjects may receive 
up to 8 .0 mL of talimogene laherparepvec 108 PFU/mL or placebo 3 weeks (+ 3 days) 
after the initial injection (ie, no sooner than day 22 but should not be delayed more than 
3 days after the 3 week time point).  All subsequent doses up to 8.0 mL of talimogene

Protocol Number:  20130232  
Date:  11 May 2018  Page 52 of 158 
CONFIDENTIAL    laherparepvec108 PFU/mL or placebo will be administered every 3 weeks (± 3) days.  If 
a delay of >  3 days is anticipated due to reasons other than toxicity, permission should 
be sought from the medical monitor.  The treatment cycle interval may be increased due 
to toxicity as described in Section 6.2.1.2 .  It is recommended that t alimogene 
laherparepvec /placebo be administe red before pembrolizumab on treatment days. 
The maximum volume of talimogene laherparepvec /placebo administered at any dose is 
4.0 mL for any individual tumor lesion.  The maximum volume at any treatment visit is 
8.0 mL.  Investigators are encouraged to us e the maximum volume whenever lesions 
allow. The recommended volume of talimogene laherparepvec /placebo to be injected 
into the tumor(s) is dependent on the size of the tumor(s) and should be determined 
according to the injection volume guideline in Table 2 . 
Table 2 .  Talimogene Laherparepvec Injection Volume Guideline  
Based on Tumor Size  
Tumor Size (longest dimension)  Maximum Injection Volume  
> 5.0 cm  (50 mm) 4.0 mL  
> 2.5 cm  (25 mm) to 5.0  cm (50 mm) 2.0 mL  
> 1.5 cm  (15 mm) to 2.5 cm  (25 mm) 1.0 mL  
> 0.5 cm  (5 mm) to 1.5 cm  (15 mm) 0.5 mL  
≤ 0.5 cm  (5 mm) 0.1 mL  
On each treatment day, prioritization of injections is recommended as follows:  
• any new injectable tumor that has appeared since the last injection  
• by tumor size, beginning with the largest tumor  
• any previously uninjectable tumor(s)  that is now injectable  
It is recommended that each lesion should receive the maximum amount possible to inject due to tumor properties at each visit before moving on the next lesion, using the prioritization model above and the injection volume guideline based on tumor size per  
Table 2 .  Tumor measurements for injection volume determination may be done by 
caliper measurements and/or by ultrasound guided measurements.  Most recent prior 
radiographic tumor assessmen t measurements may be used to determine injection 
volume if caliper measurements and/or ultrasound guided measurements are not 
feasible and/or unavailable.  The lesions injected will be recorded on the CRF.  
Note:  Continued injection into nodal lesions tha t have decreased to <  10 mm is up to 
the discretion of the investigator.

CONFIDENTIAL    Subjects will be treated with talimogene laherparepvec /placebo until subjects have 
achieved a iCR, no injectable lesions , confirmed iPD (response per irRECIST ), 
intolerance of study treatment, 24  months from the date of the first dose of talimogene 
laherparepvec /placebo, or end of study, whichever occurs first.  Due to the mechanism 
of action, subjects may experience growth in existing tumors or the appearance of new 
tumors prior to ma ximal clinical benefit of study therapy.  The dose, start date, and lot 
number of talimogene laherparepvec /placebo are to be recorded on each subject’s CRF.  
6.2.1.2  Dosage Adjustments, Delays , Rules for Withholding or Restarting , 
Permanent Discontinuation   
Dose reductions of talimogene laherparepvec /placebo are not permitted, other than with 
respect  to a reduction in the volume injected due to a disease response.  
If a subject experiences any of the following treatment- related toxicities, administration 
should be delayed until the toxicity has resolved to at least CTCAE grade 1 or baseline:  
• grade 2 or greater immune- mediated adverse events, with the exception of vitiligo 
• grade 2 or greater allergic reactions  
• any other grade 3 or greater hematologic or non- hematologic  toxicity  
Talimogene laherparepvec should be withheld if subject experiences any adverse event 
which, in the opinion of the investigator, warrants withholding investigational product.   
If the subject requires corticosteroid dosing of > 10 mg prednisone daily (or equivalent) for related toxicities, talimogene laherparepvec /placebo dosing must be withheld until the 
corticosteroid dose has decreased to ≤ 10 mg prednisone daily (or equivalent).  
All necessary supportive therapies except for those listed in Section 6.9 shall be 
available to subjects.  Talimogene laherparepvec /placebo treatment should be continued 
based on the potential benefit/risk assessment of the subject.  
If talimogene laherparepvec /placebo dosing is delayed by more than 4 weeks from the 
date of the planned dose (ie, approximately 7 weeks since the previous  dose) due to the 
occurrence of an adverse event that is considered related to talimogene 
laherparepvec /placebo, the subject must be permanently withdrawn from talimogene 
laherparepvec /placebo treatment. If talimogene laherparepvec /placebo dosing is 
delayed by more than 4 weeks from the date of the planned dose (ie, 7  weeks from the 
previous dose) for reasons other than treatment -related toxicity, the case must be 
reviewed by the sponsor medical monitor in conjunction with the investigator to 
determine if the subject can resume talimogene laherparepvec /placebo treatment .

CONFIDENTIAL    Talimogene laherparepvec/placebo doses may be given no less than 15 days apart, i f 
needed, for the purpose of re- aligning dosing schedules after a dose delay.  
Talimogene laherparepvec  in phase  1b or talimogene laherparepvec/pl acebo in phase  3 
is to be permanently discontinued for subjects meeting any of the following criteria:  
• Phase 1b subject developed DLT during the DLT evaluation period.  
• The subject, for any reason, requires treatment with another anticancer therapeutic 
agen t for treatment of the study disease (other than the exceptions noted in 
Excluded Treatments and/or Procedures During Study Period [Section 6.9].  In this 
case, discontinuation from the treatment occurs immediat ely upon introduction of the 
new agent.  
• Confirmed iPD occurs as defined per the irRECIST ( Appendix  D).  
• A grade 2 or greater immune- mediated adverse event (with the exception of vitiligo) 
or allergic reactions attributed to talimogene laherparepvec /placebo that would 
require a dose delay of greater than 4 weeks from the date of the planned dose . 
• Note : immune -mediated glomerulonephritis, vasculitis, and pneumonitis and 
exacerbation of psoriasis have been observed in subjects  receiving talimogene 
laherparepvec in clinical trials.  Most of these subjects had a history of other autoimmune disease and/or prior treatment with agents that offered plausible 
alternative etiologies however, immune -mediated adverse events can potential ly 
involve any organ system.   
• Any other talimogene laherparepvec /placebo- related non- hematologic or 
hematologic toxicities grade 3 or greater occur that, in the opinion of the investigator, 
would require a dose delay of greater than 4 weeks from the date of the planned 
dose.  
• The subject develops clinical evidence of any systemic herpes infection (such as encephalitis or disseminated infection).  
• A female subject becomes pregnant or fails to use acceptable method(s) of effective 
contraception (for those subj ects who are able to conceive).  
• A female subject breast feeds while on study treatment.  
• Concurrent medical illness that, in the judgment of the investigator, would make continued treatment with talimogene laherparepvec /placebo dangerous for the 
subject.

laherparepvec/placebo.  
6.2.2  Non-Amgen Investigational Product: Pembrolizum ab  
Non-Amgen investigational product , pembrolizumab, will also be used in this study.  
Pembrolizumab will be manufactured by Merck.  Pembrolizumab will be labeled, 
packaged, and distributed by Amgen (or designee) using Amgen (or designee) clinical study drug distribution procedures.   Pembrolizumab is supplied as pembrolizumab 
100 mg/4mL vials (25 mg/mL) solution for intravenous infusion.  
Additional details regarding pembrolizumab are provided in the IPIM.  
6.2.2.1  Pembrolizumab Dosage, Administration, and Schedule 
Pembrolizumab must be prepared and administered by a qualified healthcare professional.  Subjects should be assessed clinically for adverse events/toxicity prior to each dose using the CTCAE version 4 ( Appendix  A).  Complete blood count with 
differential and chemistry panels including liver function laboratory tests (ALT, AST, and total bilirubin) and thyroid function tests (triiodothyronine [T3]  or free T3 [ FT3] per local 
standard , free thyroxine [FT4], and thyroid stimulating hormone [TSH]) should be 
obtained according to the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 5  and Table 7) and the 
results should be checked before each treatment.  Dosing will occur only if these test 
values are acceptable per Section 6.2.2.2 .   
Note:  Thyroid Function Tests must be collected, but if there are no symptoms of 
hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism, study treatment can be initiated prior to the reporting of the laboratory results.  
Pembrolizumab at a dose of 200 mg will be administered intravenously every 3 weeks  
(± 3 days)  after the initial dose.  When talimogene laherparepvec /placebo and 
pembrolizumab are administered on the same day, it is recommended that talimogene laherparepvec/placebo be administered first. Pembrolizumab dosing will continue until a 
iCR is achieved, confirmed iPD (response per irRECIST ), intolerance to treatment, 
24 months from the date of the fi rst dose of study treatment, or end of study, whichever 
occurs first.   
Pembrolizumab infusion will be administered as a 30- minute intravenous infusion.  
Investigators should make every effort to target infusion timing to be as close to 30 minutes as possible. However, given the variability of infusion pumps from site to site, 
a window of -5 and +10 minutes is permitted (ie, infusion time is

CONFIDENTIAL    30 minutes: -5 minutes/+ 10 minutes).  A central catheter is not required for infusion; 
however if a subject has a central venous catheter in place, it is recommended that it be 
used for the infusion.  A 0.2 or 0.22 µm in- line filter made of polyethersulfone must be 
used during administration to remove any adventitious particles.  If the infusion set does not contain a 0.2 or 0.22  µm in -line filter, it is recommended to use an extension line 
containing the filter.  Details on the dose calculation, preparation, and administration are provided the IPIM.  
The dose, start date, and lot number of pembrolizumab are to be recorded  on each 
subject’s CRF.  
6.2.2.2  Dosage Adjustments, Delays , Rules for Withholding or Restarting , 
Permanent Discontinuation  
Adverse events (both non- serious and serious) associated with pembrolizumab 
exposure may represent an immunologic etiology.  These adverse ev ents may occur 
shortly after the first dose or several months after the last dose of treatment.  Pembrolizumab must be withheld for drug- related toxicities and severe or life- threatening 
adverse events as per Table 3 below.  See Section 6.2.3  for supportive care guidelines, 
including use of corticosteroids.

General instructions:  
Corticosteroi d taper should be initiated upon AE improving to grade 1 or less and continue to taper over 
at least 4 weeks.  
For situations where pembrolizumab has been withheld, pembrolizumab can be resumed after AE has 
been reduced to Grade 1 or 0 and corticosteroid has been tapered.  Pembrolizumab should be 
permanently discontinued if AE does not resolve within 12 weeks of last dose or corticosteroids cannot be 
reduced to ≤  10 mg prednisone or equivalent per day within 12 weeks.  
For severe and life-threatening irAEs, IV corticosteroid should be initiated first followed by oral steroid.  
Other immunosuppressive treatment should be initiated if irAEs cannot be controlled by corticosteroids.

Withhold or permanently discontinue pembrolizumab is at the discretion of the investigator or treating physician.  
NOTE S:  
For participants with Grade 3 or 4 immune-related endocrinopathy where withhold of pembrolizumab is required, pembrolizumab may be resumed when adverse event  resolves to ≤  Grade 2 and is controlled 
with hormonal replacement therapy or achieved metabolic control (in case of T1DM).   
For myocarditis, in certain circumstances, pembrolizumab may be resumed at grade 1 only if the 
investigator believes that the myocarditis has clinically resolved and the investigator has obtained written permission from the medical monitor to resume therapy.

CONFIDENTIAL    6.2.3  Rescue Medications and Supportive Care Guidelines for  
Pembrolizumab 
Subjects should receive appropriate supportive care measures as deemed necessary by 
the treating investigator.  
Suggested supportive care measures for the management of adverse events with potential immunologic etiology are outlined below.  Where appropriate, these guidelines include the use of oral or intravenous treatment with corticosteroids as well as additional anti-inflammatory agents if symptoms do not improve with administration of 
corticosteroids.  Note that several courses of steroid tapering may be necessary as 
symptoms may worsen when the steroid dose is decreased.  For each disorder, attempts should be made to rule out other cases such as metastatic disease or bacterial or viral infection, which  might require additional supportive care.  The treatment 
guidelines are intended to be applied when the investigator determines the events to be related to pembrolizumab.  
Note:  If after the evaluation the event is determined not to be related to pembroli zumab, 
the investigator does not need to follow the treatment guidance.  Refer to Section 6.2.1.2  
for dose modification.  
It may be necessary to perform conditional procedures such as bronchoscopy, 
endoscopy, or skin photography as part of evaluation of the event.  
6.2.3.1  Infusion Reactions  
Pembrolizumab may cause severe or life threatening infusion reactions including severe 
hypersensitivity or anaphylaxis.  Signs and symptoms usually develop during or shortly after drug infusion and generally resolve completely within 24 hours of completion of 
infusion.  Dose modification and toxicity management guidelines on pembrolizumab 
associated infusion reaction are provided in Table 4.

Events of Clinical Interest  
Events of Clinical Interest that occur after the first dose of pembrolizumab through 
30 (+7) days after the last dose of pembrolizumab must be reported to Amgen  within 
24 hours of the investigator’s knowledge of the event regardless of attribution to 
pembrolizumab.  Information on how to identify and report Event s of Clinical Interest can 
be referenced in Section 9.5. 
6.2.3.3  Diet and Other Considerations While Taking Pembrolizumab  
6.2.3.3.1  Diet During Treatment With Pembrolizumab  
Subjects should maintain a normal diet unless modifications are required to manage adverse events such as diarrhea, nausea or vomiting.  
6.2.3.3.2  Contraception Requirements for Pembrolizumab 
Pembrolizumab may have adverse effects on a fetus in utero.  Furthermore, it is not known if pembrolizumab has transient adverse effects on the composition of sperm.  
Non-pregnant, non -breast -feeding women may be enrolled if they are willing to use 
acceptable method(s) of effective contraception or are considered of non -childbearing 
potential .  Female subjects of childbearing potential and male subjects of reproductive 
potential must agr ee to avoid becoming pregnant or impregnating a partner, 
respectively, while receiving study drug and for 4 months  after the last dose of study 
drug by complying with one of the following:  
1 Practice abstinence
† from sexual activity;  
OR 
2 Use (or have their partner use) acceptable effective contraception , as defined in 
the informed consent form,  during sexual activity  
†Abstinence (relative to heterosexual activity) can be used as the sole method of 
contraception if it is consistently employed as the subject’s preferred and usual lifestyle and if considered acceptable by local regulatory agencies and IRBs/IECs.  Periodic abstinence (eg, calendar, ovulation, sympto- thermal, post -ovulation methods, etc) and 
withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.  
Refer to Section 4.2, exclusion criteria 221 and 222, for contraception requirements for 
men and women and definition of women of non -childbearing potential and men of 
reproductive potential  for this study.  Refer  to the informed consent form for acceptable

CONFIDENTIAL    method (s) of effective contraception for subjects to use in this study.  Additional 
country -specific contraception requirements may be defined in a country -specific 
protocol supplement at the end of the Appendix  Section of protocol  as required by local 
laws and regulations.  
Subjects should be informed that taking pembrolizumab may involve unknown risks to 
the fetus (unborn baby) if pregnancy were to occur during the study .  In order to 
participate in the study , men and women of reproductive potential  must adhere to the 
contraception requirements (described above) from the day of study medication initiation 
(or 14 days prior to the in ititation of study medication for oral contraception) throughout 
the study period and for  4 months  after the last dose of trial therapy .  If there is any 
question that a subject of reproductive potential will not reliably comply with the 
requirements for contraception, that subject should not be enrolled into the study.  
6.2.3.3.3  Use of Pembroliz umab in Pregnancy  
If a subject inadvertently becomes pregnant while on treatment with pembrolizumab, the 
subject will immediately be removed from the study.  The pregnancy and the outcome 
of the pregnancy will be reported to Amgen and followed as described in 
Section 9.3 (Pregnancy and Lactation Reporting).  
6.2.3.3.4  Use of Pembrolizumab in Nursing Women  
It is unknown whether pembrolizumab is excreted in human milk.  Since many drugs are 
excreted in human milk, and because  of the potential for serious adverse reactions in the 
nursing infant, female subjects who are breast -feeding are not eligible for enrollment in 
this study.   If a female subject breastfeeds while taking pembrolizumab, report the 
lactation case to Amgen as described in Section 9.3 (Pregnancy and Lactation 
Reporting).  
6.3 Other Protocol -required Therapies 
All other protocol -required therapies , including topical anesthetic or an injectable local 
anesthetic medications used for pretreatment of the talimogene laherparepvec /placebo 
injection site and oral or systemic steroids for management of pembrolizumab immune 
related adverse events , that are commercially available are not provided or reimbursed 
by the sponsor (except if required by local regulation).  The investigator  will be 
responsible for obtaining supplies of these protocol -required therapies.

Subjects with abnormal hepatic laboratory values ( ie, alkaline phosphatase [ALP], AST, 
ALT, total bilirubin  and/or international normalized ratio [INR] and/or signs/symptoms of 
hepatitis (as described in Sections 6.4.1  and 6.4.2 ) may meet the criteria for withholding 
or permanent discontinuation of investigational product as specified in the United States 
Food and Drug Administration Guidance for Industry Dr ug-Induced Liver Injury  (DILI) :  
Premarketing Clinical Evaluation, July 2009).  
6.4.1  Criteria for Permanent Discontinuation of Investigational Product s 
and Other Protocol -required Therapies Due to Potential 
Hepatotoxicity  
Investigational  product should be discontinued permanently and the subject should be 
followed according to the recommendations in Appendix  A (Additional Safety 
Assessment Information  and Drug -induced Liver Injury Reporting & Additional 
Assessments) for p ossible DILI, if ALL of the criteria below are met:  
• Current total bilirubin > 2x ULN following baseline total bilirubin < ULN or INR > 1.5  
• AND current AST or ALT > 3x ULN following  baseline AST or ALT < ULN 
respectively  
• AND no other cause for the combination of the above laboratory abnormalities is 
immediately apparent; important alternative causes for elevated AST/ALT and/or  
total bilirubin values include, but are not limited to:  
− Hepatobiliary tract disease 
− Viral hepatitis (eg, Hepatitis A/B/C/D/E, Epstein -Barr Virus, cytomegalovirus, 
Herpes Simplex Virus, Varicella, toxoplasmosis, and Parvovirus ) 
− Right sided heart failure, hypotension or any cause of hypoxia to the liver causing ischemi a.   
− Exposure to hepatotoxic agents/drugs or  hepatotoxins , including herbal and 
dietary supplements, plants and mushrooms   
− Heritable disorders causing impaired glucuronidation (eg, Gilbert’s Syndrome, 
Crigler -Najjar syndrome) and drugs that inhibit  bilirubin glucuronidation 
(eg, indinavir, atazanavir)

permanently discontinued, as deemed appropriate for the safety of the subject . 
6.4.2  Criteria for Conditional  Withholding of Investigational Product s and 
Other Protocol -required Therapies Due to Potential Hepatotoxicity  
For subjects  who do not meet the criteria for permanent discontinuation of  
investigational product outlined above and have no underlying liver disease, and 
eligibility criteria requiring normal transaminases and total bilirubin  at baseline or 
subjects with underlying liver disease and baseline abnormal transaminases, the 
following rules are recommended for withholding of investigational product and other 
protocol -required therapies:  
• Elevation of either AST or ALT according to the following schedule:  
Baseline AST or ALT value  AST or ALT elevation  
≤ 3 x ULN  > 5 x ULN for ≥  2 weeks  
≤ 3 x ULN  > 5 x ULN and unable to adhere to enhanced monitoring 
schedule  
≤ 5 x ULN  > 8 x ULN at any time 
• OR: total bilirubin  > 3x ULN at any time  
• OR: ALP >  8x ULN at any time  
Investigational product  should be withheld pending investigation into alternative causes 
of DILI.  If  investigational product (s) is withheld, the subject is to be followed according to 
recommendations in Appendix  A for possible DILI.  Rechallenge may be considered if an 
alternative cause for impaired liver tests (ALT, AST, ALP) and/or elevated total bilirubin , 
is discovered and the laboratory abnormalities resolve to normal or baseline 
(Section 6.4.3 ). 
6.4.3  Criteria for Rechallenge of Investigational Product and Ot her 
Protocol -required Therapies A fter Potential Hepatotoxicity  
The decision to rechallenge the subject should be discussed and agreed upon unanimously by the subject, investigator , and sponsor  medical monitor . 
If signs or symptoms recur with rechallenge, then investigational product and other protocol -required therapies, as appropriate  should be permanently discontinued.  
Subjects who clearly meet the criteria for permanent discontinuation (as described in Section 6.4.1 ) should never be rechallenged without consulting with the sponsor  medical 
monitor .

CONFIDENTIAL    6.5 Concomitant Therapy  
Throughout the study, investigator s may prescribe any concomitant medications or 
treatments deemed necessary to provide adequate supportive care except for those 
listed in Section 6.9. 
Concomitant therapies are to be collected in the CRF from informed consent through 
30 (+7) days after the last dose of talimogene laherparepvec /placebo or pembrolizumab, 
whichever is later.  In addition, any concomitant medications associated with serious 
adverse events that occur through 90 (+7) days after the cessation of all study treatment or 30  (+7) days following cessation of treatment if the subject initiates new ant icancer 
therapy, whichever is earlier, will be reported to the sponsor and recorded in the CRF. 
For concomitant therapies , therapy name, indication, dose, unit, frequency, route, start 
date, and stop date  must be documented. 
6.6 Other Treatment Procedures 
Local radiation treatment to the site of bone and other metastasis will be permitted for 
palliative management at any time during the study.  If a subject undergoes local radiation, the investigator or designee should notify the sponsor’s medical monitor as soon as possible and all study treatments should be withheld.  Re- exposure to 
talimogene laherparepvec/placebo and pembrolizumab may occur post palliative 
radiation treatment only if the investigator and sponsor medical monitor agree that the 
subject’s safety will not be compromised.  
If a subject demonstrates evidence of new or worsening CNS metastases, all study treatments should be withheld.  Subjects may be allowed to remain on study after 
discussion with the sponsor medical monitor provided the CNS metast ases are 
adequately treated and the investigator determines the appropriateness of treatment 
resumption.  In addition, in order to resume study treatment, the corticosteroid dose 
must not exceed 10 mg of prednisone or equivalent.  Re- exposure to talimogene 
laherparepvec/placebo and pembrolizumab may occur only if the investigator and 
sponsor  medical monitor  agree that the subject’s safety will not be compromised.  
6.7 Medical Devices  
Medical devices (eg, 0.2 or 0.22 μm in -line filter made of polyethersulfone, intravenous 
administration set, infusion pump syringes, sterile needles, alcohol prep pads) that are 
commercially available are not usually provided or reimbursed by the Sponsor  (except,

7.2 General Study Procedures  
The pr ocedures performed and timing of each study visit are outlined in the Schedule of 
Assessmen ts (Table 5 , Table 6 , and Table 7).  Details regarding each type of procedure 
are provided in subsequent subsections.  Procedures that are part of routine care are 
not considered study specific procedures and may be used at screening to determine eligibility.  
Refer to the applicable supplemental central laboratory, IVR system IPIM, and study 
manuals for detailed collection and handling procedures.  
7.2.1  Screening and Enrollment  
Informed consent must be obtained before completing any screening procedures ensue .  
After signing the written informed consent form, the site will register the subject in the 
IVR system and screen the subject in order to assess eligibility for participation.  
Screening procedures are to be completed during the screening period within 4 weeks 
prior to enrollment or randomization.  If a subject has not met all eligibility criteria at the end of the 4 week window, the subject will be registered as a screen fail ure.  Screen fail 
subjects may be eligible for re -screening once as described in Section 7.2.2 .  Prior to 
enrollment, subject eligibility must be confirmed with screening procedures.  Subjects satisfying eligibility requirem ents will be enrolled.  
7.2.2  Rescreening  
Subjects who are unable to complete or meet eligibility requirements on initial screening will be p ermitted to rescreen once.  Rescreened  subjects must first be regis tered as 
screen failed in the IVR system  and subsequently registered as rescreened.  Subjects 
will retain the same subject identification number assigned at the original screening.  Once the subject is registered as rescreened, a new 4 week screening window will 
begin.  If the rescreening period begins more than 4 weeks after the original signing of 
the informed consent form, all screening procedures, including informed consent, must be repeated.  If the rescreening occurs less than 4 weeks after the original signing of the 
informed consent, then only those criteria that were originally failed are required to be repeated.

All subjects who receive investigational product will complete a safety follow -up visit 
approximately 30 (+ 7) days after the last dose of study treatment.  
7.2.6  Long t erm Follow -up 
After the safety follow -up visits, subjects will enter the long- term follow -up.  Subjects will 
be contacted to assess survival , initiation of additional anticancer treatment  and 
EQ-5D-5L (for phase  3). 
Contact for all subjects will be attempted every 12 weeks ( ± 28 days) following  the safety 
follow -up visit until death, subject withdraws full consent, or up to 36  months after the 
last subject is enrolled/randomized that is included in the primary OS analysis , 
whichever comes first.  Anticancer therapies for SCCHN and talimogene 
laherparepvec/placebo related adverse events that occur through the end the long  term 
follow -up will be reported.   The phase 1b subjects will be followed for approximately 
36 months after the last subject is enrolled .   
For subjects who discontinued treatment  for any reason other than confirmed PD, every 
effort should be made to collect PROs  for phase  3 subjects  (QLQ -C30, QLQ -HN35 , and 
EQ-5D-5L), perform radiographic scans  for tumor imaging  every 12 weeks ( ± 1 week ) 
until documentation of confirmed iPD (response per irRECIST ), start of new anticancer 
therapy, or end of study, whichever occurs first.  
For those subjects who are randomized but do not receive any doses of investigational 
product, every effort should be made to continue monitoring tumor response sta tus by 
clinical and radiographic assessments as described in Table 5  and Table 7.  They 
should continue into the long- term follow -up and be followed for survival and subseq uent 
anticancer therapies every 12 weeks (± 28 days) for approximately 36 months after the

CONFIDENTIAL    7.3.7  Physical Examination  
A physical examination will be performed at screening per standard of care.  At 
subsequent visits (or as clinically indicated), limited symptom -directed physical 
examinations should be performed.  Changes from baseline abnormalities should be 
recorded as adverse event s on the adverse event  CRF.  Physical examinati on findings 
should be recorded on the appropriate CRF (eg, medical history, event) . 
7.3.8  Vital Signs  
Vital signs include systolic/diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and temperature.  It is recommended that subjects be in a supine position in a rested and 
calm state for at least 5  minutes before blood pressure assessments are conducted.  If 
the subject is unable to be in the supine position, the subject should be in the most recumbent position possible.  The position selected and temperature location for a 
subject should be the same that is used throughout the study and document on the vital sign CRF.  All measurements are to be recorded on the vital signs CRF.   
Vital signs should be obtained prior to study treatment administration, and if necessary, 
during and after administration of study treatment. 
7.3.9  Physical Measurements 
Body weight will be recorded in kilograms.  Height will be collected in centimeters.  
7.3.10  ECG  
A 12-lead ECG will be performed per standard of care.  Subject must be in a supine 
position in a rested and calm state for at least 5  minutes before ECG assessment is 
conducted.  If the subject is unable to be in the supine position, the subject should be in 
the most recumbent position possible.  The ECG must include the following measure ments:  heart rate, PR interval, QRS, QT, and QTc intervals.  The investigator 
or designated site physician will review all ECGs.  Once signed, the original ECG tracing will be retained with the subject’s source documents.  At the request of the sponsor, a  
copy of the original ECG will be made available to the sponsor . 
7.3.11  ECOG Performance Status  
ECOG performance status will be collected as outlined in Appendix F . 
7.3.12  Exposure to Talimogene Laherparepvec

talimogene laherparepvec) while the subject is taking talimogene 
laherparepvec/placebo, the exposure must be reported to the sponsor .  Refer to 
Section 9.4. 
7.3.13  Radiographic Tumor Assessment  
At screening ( baseline) and throughout the study, radiographic tumor imaging 
assessments must include CT scan, PET/contrast enhanced CT  scan , or MRI of the 
neck, chest, abdomen, and other relevant sites of disease.  A CT scan or MRI of the 
brain will only be performed if signs or symptoms suggestive of CNS metastasis are present.  A spiral CT scan of the chest may be obtained but is not a requirement.  An 
MRI or non- contrast CT scan may be used in subjects for whom CT scans with contrast 
are contraindicated (ie, subjects with contrast allergy or impaired renal clearance.  
Imaging will be performed per the Schedule of Assessment s (Table 5  and Table 7) or 
more frequently if clinically indicated until confirmed iPD (response per irRECIST ), or 
start of new anticancer treatment.  Response ( iCR, or iPR) or iPD is to be confirmed by 
second consecutive assessments no less than 4 weeks from the date of the first documented response or iPD.  Imaging should not be adjusted for cycle initiation delays 
and performed according to the calendar.  The imaging modality selected (eg, CT scan 
or MRI) should remain constant for any individual subject  
Furtherm ore, t he same radiographic procedure used to assess disease sites at 
screening (baseline) should be used throughout the study (eg, the same contrast 
protocol for CT scans).  All known sites of disease must be documented at screening and re -assessed at each  subsequent tumor evaluation.  The radiographic tumor imaging 
assessments and measurements are performed locally  and the response will be 
assessed by the investigator using irRECIST criteria ( Appendix  D).  For phase 3 only,  
investigators will also be asked to asses s and document tumor responses using the 
standard RECIST v1.1 criteria ( Appendix E).  However, treatment decisions should NOT 
be made based on RECIST v1.1. 
7.4 Laboratory Assessments 
On-treatment tests can be performed within 3 days of the planned visit.  Results should 
be reviewed prior to the administration of study treatment.  All tests (except for real -time 
polymerase chain reaction [qPCR], HSV- 1 antibody, tumor biopsy, pem brolizum ab PK 
and ADAs , and blood for biomarkers) are to be performed at the local laboratory .  See

HSV-1 infection is suspected.  A qPCR analysis will be performed on the swab sample 
by the central laboratory to evaluate whether talimogene laherparepvec DNA is detectable in the sample.   Refer to the Laboratory Manual for more details.  
7.4.3  Optional Photography Substudy (Select ed Phase 1b Sites And 
Phase 3 Sites) 
For sites selected to participate in the photography substudy,  photographs of visible 
lesions may be taken at any time during the study period, or copies of pre -existing 
photographs may be collected if available.  . The sponsor may use, copy, and/or 
distribute the photographs for educational purposes, in scientific lectures, journal articles, and textbooks.  The sponsor may also use the photographs for general commercial pur poses and may have the photographs published, circulated, or presented 
in any way either alone or with other written, printed, graphic, or audio ma tter to 
members of the medical, nursing, pharmaceutical and related progressions, as well as to the public at large.  The subjects’ identity will not be disclosed in any photographs.  The sponsor would only show the photographs of s ubjects without identify ing the subject 
facial characteristics. Any tattoos or other body marks that may identify the subjects will 
be covered. The sponsor may edit, reduce, enlarge, or otherwise change the 
photographs.  The photographs may have commercial value to the sponsor.  Neither the 
sponsor nor the investigator will compensate the subject for the photographs or the use of the photographs.  Refer to the Photography Manual for further instructions.  
7.5 Biomarker  Sample  Collection  
Biomarkers are objectively measured and evaluate indicators of normal biologic 
processes, pathogenic processes, or pharmacological responses to a therapeutic intervention.   In oncology, there is particular interest in the molecular changes underlying 
the oncogenic processes that may identify cancer subtypes, stage of disease, assess the amount of tumor growth, or predict disease progression, metastasis, and responses to study treatment . 
The sponsor  may attempt to develop test(s) designed to identify subjects most like to 
respond positively or negatively to investigational product(s) (eg, Amgen or non- Amgen 
investigational product or protocol required therapies).

following time points:  at day  1 of weeks  0, 3, 6, 9, and either at the time of initial 
unconfirmed iPR, confirmed iPD, or at week  24 for subjects with iSD, whichever comes 
first.  A blood sample should be collected at the safety follow -up visit.  Refer to the 
Laboratory Manual for blood sample pr ocedures.  
7.5.2  Tumor Tissue Samples  
Tumor tissue biopsies are to be collected and CD8 and PD-L1 will be evaluated to 
explore molecular mechanisms associated with response or resistance to treatment. 
Baseline Tumor Tissue Samples  
Phase 1b 
Formalin fixed paraffin  embedded tumor tissue and associated pathology report sample 
from the primary or metastatic lesion should be submitted within 4 weeks of enrollment 
to the central laboratory  
Phase 3 
Formalin fixed paraffin embedded tumor tissue and associated pathology report  from 
the primary or metastatic lesion will be collected and must be submitted within 28 days 
before randomization to the central laboratory. 
Both Phases  
Tissue prioritization is as follows:  
(1) Whenever possible fresh tissue from newly obtained biopsy is  preferred.  If 
not available, archival tissue may be submitted.  
(2) When submitting a previously archived tissue sample, the most recent tissue 
available is preferred.  
(3) Tissue samples from metastatic sites are preferred over those from the primary tumor. 
(4) Tissue sample should be from outside of the field of maximum radiation dose 
delivered, whenever possible.  
Note:  If no tumor sample  is available, the subject should be willing to undergo and 
submit tissue from a new biopsy.  Biopsies should be obtained outside of the field of 
maximum radiation dose delivered, whenever possible.  Subjects with an unevaluable 
tumor sample for PD -L1 expression testing may obtain a new biopsy and subjects with 
an unevaluable newly obtained biopsy may underg o re-biopsy at the discretion of the

There will be an optional tumor biopsy at week 6 for phase  1b and phase  3 subjects who 
have consented for the procedure . 
Archival tumor tissue 
Whenever possible for phase 1b and phase  3 subjects, it is asked that an additional 
archival sample of any age, preferably predating the baseline tumor t issue by greater 
than 6  months be submitted to assess for potential changes in biomarkers that may 
result from cancer progression over time.  If archival tumor samples are submitted in 
addition to required samples  for enrollment/randomization, a block of f ormalin -fixed 
paraffin -embedded tumor tissue is to be sent to the central laboratory along with the 
corresponding pathology report within 4 weeks after randomization/enrollment.  The 
tumor block is to be carefully selected by a pathologist or a skilled experience histology 
associate to include generous tumor tissue using the pathology report as a guide.  In lieu 
of a block, approximately 20 to 25  unstained sections on charged slides from the same 
block can be submitted.  When the samples of tumor tissues are available, analyses of tumor specific mutations or epigenetic changes may be performed (eg, somatic mutations).  
7.5.3  HPV Testing 
Both phases  
HPV status in subjects with oropharyngeal cancer  is required.   
Oral cavity, hypopharynx, and larynx cancer are not required to undergo HPV testing by p16 IHC as by convention, they are assumed to be HPV -negative.   
HPV p16 testing, defined as p16 IHC testing using the CINtec
 assay and a 70% cutoff 
point, can be done at a local laboratory (if the test can be performed locally per standard 
of care).  
Phase 1b 
Results of HPV testing performed at a local laboratory and the assay that was used 
should be recorded on the CRF form.  
Product:  Talimogene Laherparepvec  
Protocol Number:  20130232  
Date:  11 May 2018  Page 92 of 158 
CONFIDENTIAL    If previously performed HPV result is not available, sites should be willing to submit for 
central laboratory HPV testing using the baseline tumor tissue sample submitted. 
Phase 3 
Results of HPV testing for all subjects with oropharyngeal cancer will  be required for 
stratification.  HPV stratification in this trial will be performed using local or central testing 
of HPV status  on tumor tissue samples that were obtained during the screening period.   
The testing of HPV of tumor specimen for oropharyngeal cancer in this study is defined 
as p16 IHC testing using the CINtec assay and a 70% cutoff point.  If t his assay is 
unavailable locally, central laboratory HPV testing should be done using the tumor tissue 
sample submitted within 28 days of randomization.   Pembrolizumab PK and Anti-Drug 
Antibodies ( ADA) Testing   
Pembrolizumab PK and ADA testing should be collected per the timepoints listed in the 
Schedule of Assessments  (Table 5  and Table 7). 
7.6 Optional Pharmacogenetic Studies  
If the subject consents to the optional pharmacogenetic portion of this study, DNA 
analyses may be performed.  These optional pharmacogenetic analyses focus on inherited genetic variations to evaluate their possible correlation to the disease and/or 
responsiveness to the therapies used in this study .  The goals of these  optional 
pharmacogenetic studies include the use of genetic markers to help in the investigation 
of cancer and/or to identify subjects who may have positive or negative response to 
talimogene laherparepvec and/or pembrolizumab.  For this opt ional pharmacogenetics 
analysis, 1 additional blood sample will be collected prior to study treatment   
7.7 Patient Reported Outcomes (Phase 3 only)  
PROs will be assessed using the following  3 questionnaires: EORTC QLQ -C30, 
QLQ -H&N35 , and EQ -5D-5L.  The three  questionnaires  are commonly  used, uniformly 
accepted and validated instruments to evaluate health outcomes in subjects with cancer .  
PRO questionnaires will be administered to subjects where translations are available.  
Subjects should be given sufficient space and time to complete the questionnaire.  Family members or friends should not assist the subject in completing the questionnaire.  The time required to complete the questionnaire will be less than 10 minutes.  
The study coordinator should check the responses for completeness and encourage the subject to complete any missing responses.  Detailed instructions relating to the 
administrative procedures of the questionnaires will be provided to the sites.  Subject’s

CONFIDENTIAL    refusal (including reason for refusal) to c omplete all or any part of the questionnaire 
should be documented in the study data capture system. 
The study coordinator should not interpret any items or the response opti ons.  If a 
subject asks what an item means then repeat the item to them verbatim.  Ask the subject 
to answer the item according to what they think the question means.  If they have trouble 
deciding on an answer, ask them to choose the response that comes closest to how they 
feel.  Subjects have the option of not answering a question if they truly do not understand the question.  
PRO questionnaires will be collected via paper.  During long- term follow -up, EQ -5D may 
be collected via telephone (upon identification of the subject ). 
7.7.1  EORTC QLQ -C30 
The EORTC QLQ -C30 Version 3.0 is a 2 -page, self -reporting 30 -item generic instrument 
for use in cancer subjects across tumor types  (Bjordal et al., 2000 ).  It assesses 
15 domains consisting of 5 functional domains (physical, role, emotional, cognitive, 
social), 9 symptom domains (fatigue, nausea and vomiting, pain, dyspnea, insomnia, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea, financial difficulties), and a global health status or QOL scale  (Aaronson et al, 1993).  
7.7.2  EORTC QLQ -H&N35  
EORTC QLQ -H&N35 is a head and neck –specific questionnaire designed to assess the  
quality of life of patients with head and neck cancer .  The questionnaire contains 
35 items, which can be condensed into 7 multi -item and 11 single- item scales.   The 
questionnaire results in scales that score from 0 to 100.  For the function scales, a score 
of 100 means perfect quality of life, whereas for the symptom scales it would indicate heavy burden.  
7.7.3  Health State Utility Estimates  
HSU estimates for the purpose of inclusion in a health economic model will be derived 
using the EQ -5D-5L. 
The EQ -5D-5L questionnaire is a 2- page, generic preference- based QOL measure 
comprised of a 5 -item health status measure and a visual analogue scale (VAS)  
(Kind, 1996; Rabin and de Charro, 2001 ) and is used to generate 2 scores.  The  
EQ-5D-5L utility score is based on answers to 5 questions that evaluate mobility, 
self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression.  The EQ -5D-5L VAS 
generates a single health status index an analogue scale ranges from 0 to 100 in which

CONFIDENTIAL    subjects are asked to rate their current health state by drawing a line from a box marked, 
“Your health today.”  
7.8 Sample Storage and Destruction  
Any blood, swabs,  or tumor sample collected according to the Schedule of Assessments 
(Table  5, Table 6 , and Table 7) can be analyzed for any of the tests outlined in the 
protocol and for any tests necessary to minimize risks to study subjects.  This includes testing to ensure that analytical methods produce reliable and valid data throughout the 
course of the study.  This can also include, but is not limited to, investigation of unexpected results, incurred sample reanalysis, and analyses  for method transfer and 
comparability.  
All samples and associated results will be coded prior to being shipped from the site for 
analysis or storage.  Samples will be tracked using a unique identifier that is assigned to 
the samples for the study.  Results are stored in a secure database to ens ure 
confidentiality.  
If informed consent is provided by the subject, the sponsor can do additional testing on 
remaining samples (ie, residual and back up) to investigate and better understand the cancer, the dose response, and/or prediction of response to talimogene laherparepvec and/or pembrolizumab, characterize antibody response, and characterize aspects of the molecule (eg, mechanism of action/target, metabolites).  Results from this analysis are to be document and maintained, but are not necessarily reported as part of this study.  
Samples can be retained for up to 20 years.  
Since the evaluations are not expected to benefit the subject directly or alter the 
treatment course, the results of pharmacogenetics, biomarker development, or other exploratory studies are not placed in the subject’s medical record and are not to be made available to the subject, members of the family, the personal physician, or other third parties, except as specified in the informed consent.  
The subject retains the right to request that the sample material be destroyed by contacting the investigator.  Following the study request from the subject, the investigator is to provide the sponsor with the required study and subject number so that 
any remaining blood or tumor samples and any other components from the cells can be 
located and destroyed.  Samples will be destroyed once all protocol -defined procedures 
are completed.  However, information collected from samples prior to the request for destruction, will be retained by the spons or.

CONFIDENTIAL    The sponsor is the exclusive owner of any data, discoveries, or derivative materials from 
the sam ple materials and is responsible for the destruction of the sample(s) at the 
request of the subject through the investigator, at the end of the storage period, or as appropriate (eg, the scientific rationale for experimentation with a certain sample type no longer justifies keeping the sample).  If a commercial product is developed from this 
research project, the sponsor owns the commercial product.  The subject has no 
commercial rights to such a project and has no commercial rights to the data, information, discoveries, or derivative materials gained or produced from the sample.  See Section 11.3 for subject conf identiality.  
8. WITHDRAWAL FROM TREATMENT, PROCEDURES, AND STUDY  
8.1 Subject s’ Decision to Withdraw  
Subjects have the right to withdraw from the study at any time and for any reason without prejudice to their future medical care by the physician or at the institution.  
Subjects (or a legally acceptable representative) can decline to continue receiving 
investigational product and/or other protocol -required therapies or procedures at any 
time during the study  but continue participation in the study .  If this occurs, the 
investigator is to discuss with the subject the appropriate processes for discontinuation 
from investigational product or other protocol- required therapies and must discuss with 
the subject t he options for continuation of the Schedule of Assessments  (Table 5 , 
Table 6 , and Table 7) including  different options for follow -up (eg, in person, by 
phone/email, through family/friends, in  correspondence/communication with other 
treating physicians, the review of medical records) and collection of data, including 
endpoints and adverse events .  Subjects that have discontinued investigational product 
and/or protocol required therapies or procedures should not be automatically removed from the study.  Whenever safe and feasible, it is imperative that subjects remain on study to undergo safety surveillance and/or collection of outcome data.   The investigator 
must document the change to the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 5 , Table  6, and 
Table 7) and the level of follow -up that is agreed to by the subject (eg, in person, by  
telephone/mail, through family/friends, in correspondence/communication with other physicians, from review of the medical records).  
For subjects who discontinue investigational product without documented i PD and have 
not initiated a new anticancer therapy, every effort should be made to continue monitoring tumor response status by clinical and radiographic assessments, and to complete PRO questionnaires as described in Table  5 and Table  7. 
Product:  Talimogene Laherparepvec  
Protocol Number:  20130232  
Date:  11 May 2018  Page 96 of 158 
CONFIDENTIAL    Those subjects who discontinue investigational product should continue into the 
long-term follow -up.  Subjects will be followed for survival and subsequent anticancer 
therapies every 12 weeks ( ± 28 days) for approximately 36 months after the last subject 
is enrolled.   In addition, talimogene laherparepvec - or placebo -related adverse events 
that occur through the end of the long- term follow -up will be reported.Withdrawal of full 
consent for a study means that the subject does not wish to receive further protocol -required therapies or procedures , and the subject does not wish to or is unable 
to continue further study participation.  Su bject data up to withdrawal of consent will be 
included in the analysis of the study , and where permitted, publically available data can 
be included after withdrawal of consent.  The investigator is to discuss  with the subject 
appropriate procedures for withdrawal from the study.  
8.2 Investigator or Sponsor Decision to Withdraw  or Terminate 
Subjects’ Participation Prior to Study Completion  
The investigator and /or sponsor can decide to withdraw a subject(s) from investigational 
product and/or other protocol- required therapies, protocol procedures , or the study as a 
whole at any time prior to study completion. 
Subjects m ay be eligible for continued treatment with Amgen investigational product (s) 
and/or other protocol -required therapies by a separate protocol or as provided for by the 
local country’s regulatory mechanism, based on parameters consistent with Section 12.1. 
8.3 Reasons for Removal From Treatment or Study   
8.3.1  Reasons for Removal From Treatment  
Reasons for removal from protocol -required investigational product(s) or procedural 
assessments include any of the following : 
• subjec t request  
• safety concern (eg, due to an adverse event, ineligibility determined, protocol 
deviation, non- compliance, requirement for alternative therapy , pregnancy)  
• other protocol specified criteria see Sections 6.2.1.1, 6.2.1.2 , 6.2.2.1  and 6.2.2.2 ). 
• death  
• lost to follow -up 
• decision by sponsor  (other than subject request, safety concern, lost to follow -up) 
• disease progression  
• subject’s treatment assignment is unblinded during the double- blind phase of the 
study via the IVR system for the future management of the subject, and subject is not 
allowed to continue treatment (see Sectio n 5.2)

9. SAFETY DATA COLLECTION, RECORDING, AND REPORTING  
9.1 Definition of Safety Events  
9.1.1  Disease Related Events 
Disease Related Events are events (serious or non- serious) anticipated to occur in the 
study population due to the underlying disease.  These could include events such as 
pain or discomfort c aused by growing tu mors  due to overall worsening of disease.  Such 
events do not meet the definition of an Adverse Event unless assessed to be more 
severe than expected for the subject’s condition and/or if the investigator believes that 
the event is related  to the investigational product(s)/study treatment/protocol required 
therapies . 
Further, any disease related event which meets any of the serious ness  criteria in 
Section 9.1.3  should be reported as a Serious Disease Related E vent.  
Note:  For situations where disease related events are due to SCCHN, the primary tumor 
type (eg, metastatic SCCHN) should be used, rather than the term  “disease 
progression”.  
9.1.2  Adverse Events  
An adverse event is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical trial 
subject.  The event does not necessarily have a causal relationship with study treatment.  The investigator is responsible for ensuring that any adverse events observed by the 
investigator or reported by the subject are  recorded in the subject’s medical record.  
The definition of adverse events includes  worsening of a pre -existing medical condition.  
Worsening indicates that the pre -existing medical condition or underlying disease 
(eg, diabetes, migraine headaches, gout) has increased in severity, frequency, and/or 
duration more than would be expected, and/or has an association with a significantly 
worse outcome  than expected.  A pre -existing condition that has not worsened more 
than anticipated (ie, more than usual fluctuation of disease) during the study or involves 
Product:  Talimogene Laherparepvec  
Protocol Number:  20130232  
Date:  11 May 2018  Page 98 of 158 
CONFIDENTIAL    an intervention such as elective cosmetic surgery or a medical procedure while on study , 
is not considered an adverse event. 
Note:  For situations where adverse events are due to SCCHN, the primary tumor type 
(eg, metastatic SCCHN) should be used, rather than t he term “disease progr ession”.  
The investigator’s clinical judgment is used to determine whether a subject is to be 
removed from treatment due to an adverse event.  In the event a subject, or subject’s 
legally acceptable representative request s to withdraw from protocol- required therapies  
or the study due to an adverse event , refer to Section 8.1 for additional instructions on 
the procedures recommended for safe withdrawal from protocol -required therapies or 
the study.  
9.1.3  Serious Adverse Events 
A serious adverse event is defined as an adverse event that meets at least 1 of the following serious criteria:  
• fatal 
• life threatening (places the subject at immediate risk o f death)  
• requires in -patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization 
• results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• other medically important serious event  
A disease related event (eg, PD or pain or discomfort caused by growing tumors)  is to 
be reported as a serious adverse event if  
• the subject’s pre -existing condition becomes worse than what the investigator would 
consider typical for a patient with the same underlying condition, or 
• if the in vestigator believes a causal relationship exists between the investigational 
medicinal product(s)/protocol- required therapies  and the event ,  
• and the event meets at least 1 of the serious criteria above.  
An adverse event would meet the criterion of “requires hospitalization”, if the event 
necessitated an admission to a health care facility (eg, overnight stay).   
If an investigator considers an event to be clinically important, but it does not meet any 
of the serious criteria, the event could be classified as a serious adverse event under the 
criterion of “other medically important serious event”.  Examples of such events could include a new cancer that is not a condition of the study, events associated with an 
overdose, allergic bronchospasm, convulsions, blood dyscrasias, DILI (see Appendix  A 
Product:  Talimogene Laherparepvec  
Protocol Number:  20130232  
Date:  11 May 2018  Page 99 of 158 
CONFIDENTIAL    for DILI reporting criteria), or events that necessitate an emergency room visit, outpatient 
surgery, or urgent intervention.  
9.2 Safety Event Reporting Procedures  
9.2.1  Reporting Procedures for Disease Related Events 
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that all Disease Related Events (serious or 
non-serious) observed by the investigator or reported by the subject that occur after the 
first dose of talimogene laherparepvec /placebo or pembrolizumab through the safety 
follow -up visit  (ie, 30 [+7] days after the last dose of talimogene laherparepvec /placebo 
or pembrolizumab, whichever is later) , are recorded on the Event CRF as a Disease 
Related Event . 
The investigator must assign t he following attributes to each disease related event:  
• disease related event diagnosis or syndrome(s), if known (if not known, signs or 
symptoms), 
• dates of onset and resolution (if resolved)  
• severity (and/or toxicity per protocol),  
• assessment of relatednes s to talimogene laherparepvec/placebo and/or 
pembrolizumab and,  
• action taken  
CTCAE version 4.0 will be used to grade a disease related event.  The grading scale 
used in this study is described in Appendix  A. 
Note:  If the e vent is more severe than expected for the subject’s condition or if the 
investigator believes there is a causal relationship between the investigational product(s)/study treatment/protocol required therapies and disease worsening, the event should be reported as an adverse event, not a disease related event. 
The investigator is expected to follow reported disease related events (serious or 
non-serious) until stabilization or reversibility.  
9.2.2  Adverse Events  
9.2.2.1  Reporting Procedures for Adverse Events That Do Not Meet Serious 
Criteria  
The investigator  is responsible for ensuring that all adverse events observed by the 
investigator  or reported by the subject that occur after  the first dose of talimogene 
laherparepvec/placebo or pembrolizumab through the safe ty follow -up visit (ie, 
30 [+7] days after the last dose of talimogene laherparepvec /placebo or pembrolizumab, 
whichever is later ) are reported using the Event CRF.  
Product:  Talimogene Laherparepvec  
Protocol Number:  20130232  
Date:  11 May 2018  Page 100  of 158 
CONFIDENTIAL    The investigator must assign the following attributes to each adverse event:  
• Adverse event diagnosis or syndrome(s), if known (if not known, signs or symptoms),  
• Dates of onset and resolution (if resolved) , 
• Severity (and/or toxicity per protocol), 
• Assessment of relatedness to talimogene laherparepvec /placebo and/or 
pembrolizumab and, 
• Action taken.  
The adverse event grading scale used will be the CTCAE  version 4.0.  The grading 
scale used in this study is described in Appendix  A.  The investigator must assess 
whether the adverse event is possibly related to the talimogene laherparepvec /placebo 
and/or pembrolizumab.  This relationship is indicated by a “yes” or “no” response to the 
question:  Is there a reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by the 
investigational product(s) ? 
The investigator is responsible for reviewing laboratory test results and determining 
whether an abnormal value in an individual study subject represents a clinically significant change from the subject’s baseline values.  In general, abnormal laboratory findings without clini cal significance (based on the investigator's judgment) are not to be 
recorded as adverse events.  However, laboratory value changes that require treatment or adjustment in current therapy are considered adverse events.  Where applicable, clinical sequelae (not the laboratory abnormality) are to be recorded as the adverse 
event.  
The investigator is expected to follow reported adverse events until stabilization or 
reversibility.  
9.2.2.2  Reporting Procedures for Serious Adverse Events  
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that all serious adverse events, follow -up to a serious adverse event, including death due to any cause other than 
progression of the cancer under study, observed by the investigator or reported by the subject that  occur after signing of the informed consent through 
90 (+7) days after the last dose of talimogene laherparepvec or pembrolizumab, or 
30 (+7) days following cessation of treatment if the subject initiates new 
anticancer therapy, whichever is earlier, are recorded in the subject’s med ical 
record and are submitted to Amgen.  Additionally, all study drug- related serious 
adverse events that occur during the long- term safety follow -up period until the

Protocol Number:  20130232  
Date:  11 May 2018  Page 101  of 158 
CONFIDENTIAL    end of study should also be captured in the Event CRF although these events will 
not be considered treatment -emergent adverse events. 
All serious adverse events must be submitted to the sponsor within 24 hours 
following the investigator’s knowledge of the event via the Event CRF.  
If the electronic data capture (EDC) system is unavailable to the site staff to report the 
serious adverse event, the information is to be reported to the sponsor via an electronic 
Serious Adverse Event Contingency Report Form within 24 hours of the investigator’s knowledge of the event.  See Appendix  B for a sample of the Serious Adverse Event 
Worksheet /electronic Serious Adverse Event Contingency Report Form.  The data must 
be entered into the EDC system when the system is again available.  
The investigator must assess whether  the serious adverse event is possibly related to 
any study -mandated activity or procedure.  This relationship is indicated by a “yes” or 
“no” response to the question:  “Is there a reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by a study activity/procedure”?  
The investigator is expected to follow reported serious adverse events until stabilization or reversibility.  
All new information relating to a previously reported serious adverse event must be 
submitted to the sponsor within 24 hours following knowledge of the new information.  
The investigator may be asked to provide additional follow -up information, which may 
include a discharge summary or extracts from the medical record.  Information provided about the serious adverse event must be consistent with that recorded on the Event CRF.  
If a subject is permanently withdrawn from protocol -required therapies because of a 
serious adverse event, this information must be submitted to  the sponsor . 
To comply with worldwide reporting regulations for s erious adverse events, the treatment 
assignment of subjects who develop serious, unexpected, and related adverse events may be unblinded by the sponsor before submission to regulatory authorities.  
The sponsor will report serious adverse events and/or suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions as required to regulatory authorities, investigators/institutions, and IRBs/IECs in compliance with all reporting requirements according to local regulatory 
requirements and procedures .

Protocol Number:  20130232  
Date:  11 May 2018  Page 102  of 158 
CONFIDENTIAL    The investigator is to notify the appropriate IRB/IEC of serious adverse events occurring 
at the site and other adverse event reports received from the sponsor, in accordance 
with local procedures and statutes.  
9.2.2.3  Reporting Serious Adverse Events After the Protocol -required 
Reporting Period 
There is no requirement to monitor study subjects for serious adverse events following the protocol -required reporting period or after end of study.  However, these serious 
adverse events can be reported to  the sponsor.  In some countries (eg, European Union 
[EU] member states), investigators are required to report serious adverse events that 
they become aware of after end of study.  If serious adverse events are reported, the 
investigator is to report them to the sponsor within 24 hours following the investigator’s 
knowledge of the event.  
Serious adverse events reported outside of the protocol -required reporting period will be 
captured within the safety database as clinical trial cases for the purposes of expedited 
reporting.  
9.3 Pregnancy and Lactation Reporting  
If a female subject becomes pregnant, or a male subject fathers a child, while the subject is taking talimogene laherparepvec/placebo or pembrolizumab, report the pregnancy to Amgen Global Patient Safety as specified below.  
In addition to reporting  any pregnancies occurring during the study, investigators should 
report pregnancies that occur 3  months after the last dose of talimogene laherparepvec 
or 4 months after the last dose of pembrolizumab.  
The pregnancy should be reported to Amgen Global Patient Safety within 24 hours of 
the investigator’s knowledge of the event of a pregnancy.  Report a pregnancy on the 
Pregnancy Notification Worksheet ( Appendix  C).  Amgen Global Patient Safety will 
follow up with the investigator regarding additional information that may be requested.  
If a female subject becomes pregnant during the study, the investigator should attempt 
to obtain information regarding the birth outcome and health of the infant.  
If the outcome of the p regnancy meets a criterion for immediate classification as a 
Serious Adverse Event (eg, female subject experiences a spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, or neonatal death or there is a fetal or neonatal congenital anomaly) the investigator will report the event as a Serious Adverse Event.

CONFIDENTIAL    If a female breastfeeds while taking protocol -required therapies report the lactation case 
to Amgen as specified below.  
Any lactation case should be reported to Amgen Global Patient Safety within 24 hours of 
the investigator’s knowledge of event.  Report a lactation case on the Lactation 
Notification Worksheet ( Appendix  C).  Amgen Global Patient Safety will follow -up with 
the investigator regarding additional information that may be r equested.  
If a male subject's female partner becomes pregnant, the investigator should discuss obtaining information regarding the birth outcome and health of the infant from the pregnant partner.  
9.4 Reporting of Exposure to Talimogene Laherparepvec/Placebo 
If a household member, caregiver, or healthcare provider who has had close contact 
with a subject treated with talimogene laherparepvec /placebo on this study is suspected 
to have been exposed to talimogene laherparepvec /placebo (eg, have or who have had 
signs or symptoms suspected to be herpetic in origin or who have been accidentally 
exposed to talimogene laherparepvec /placebo), while the subject is taking talimogene 
laherparepvec/placebo, report the exposure to the sponsor as specified below. In 
addition to reporting an unintended exposure case during the study treatment, investigators should monitor for potential exposure cases that occur  through 
30 (+7) days after the last dose of talimogene laherparepvec /placebo. 
Any potential or known unintended exposure should be reported to the sponsor within 
24 hours of the investigator’s knowledge of the event of exposure.  The sponsor will 
seek to follow -up with the exposed individual, if necessary, to collect more information 
about the exposed individual contact with clinical trial subject, signs and/or symptoms related to the exposure, medical history, and/or outcome of the exposure. If the exposed individual is reporting sign or symptoms suspected to be related to talimogene laherparepvec/placebo exposure, the exposed individual may be asked to have a swab 
taken to evaluate for the presence of talimogene laherparepvec DNA in the suspected 
herpetic lesion by qPCR testing . 
9.5 Pembrolizumab Events of Clinical Interest  
Selected adverse events known as Pembrolizumab Event s of Clinical Interest (ECI) 
must be reported to the sponsor within 24 hours of the investigator’s knowledge of the event regardless of attribution to pembrolizumab.

CONFIDENTIAL    For the time period beginning when the consent form is signed until treatment 
enrollment/r andomization, any pembrolizumab ECI, or follow up to an ECI, that occurs to 
any subject must be reported within 24 hours to the sponsor if it causes the subject to be excluded from the trial, or is the result of a protocol- specified intervention, including  but 
not limited to washout or discontinuation of usual therapy, diet, placebo treatment, or a 
procedure.  
For the time period beginning at treatment enrollment/randomization through 
30 (+7) days following cessation of pembrolizumab treatment, any Pembroliz umab ECI, 
or follow -up to a Pembrolizumab ECI, whether or not related to pembrolizumab, must be 
reported within 24 hours to the sponsor . 
Pembrolizumab Events of Clinical Interest for this trial include: 
• an overdose of pembrolizumab, as defined in Section 9.6 
• potential drug- induced liver injury (DILI) from pembrolizumab as defined in 
Section 9.7 
Subjects should be assessed for possible Pembrolizumab ECI prior to each dose .  
9.6 Definition of an Overdose of Pembrolizumab for this Protocol and 
Reporting of Pembrolizumab Overdose 
For the purpose of this trial, an overdose of pembrolizumab will be defined as any dose 
of pembrolizumab equal to or greater than 1000  mg.  No specific information is available 
on the treatment of overdose of pembrolizumab.  In the event of overdose, 
pembrolizumab should be discontinued and the subject should be observed closely for 
signs of toxicity.  Appropriate treatment should be provided if clinically indicated.  
If an adverse event(s) or serious adverse event(s) is associated with (“result from”) the overdose of pembrolizumab, the adverse event(s) or serious adverse event is to be reported to the sponsor as described in Section 9.2.2 .  In addition, the adverse event(s) 
or serious adverse event(s) associated with (“result from”) the overdose of pembrolizumab should be reported as an ECI as described in Section 9.5. 
9.7 Definition and Reporting of Pembrolizumab Drug-induced Liver 
Injury  
For the purpose of this trial, potential DILI associated with (“resulting from”) 
pembrolizumab will be defined as:  
• elevated AST or ALT ≥ 3 x ULN  
• AND elevated total bilirubin ≥ 2 x ULN

Protocol Number:  20130232  
Date:  11 May 2018  Page 105  of 158 
CONFIDENTIAL    • AND ALP < than 2 x ULN, as determined by way of protocol -specified laboratory 
testing or unscheduled laboratory testing.*  
• Note :  These criteria are based upon available regulatory guidance documents.  The 
purpose of the criteria is to specify a threshold of  abnormal hepatic tests that may 
require an additional evaluation for an underlying etiology.  The trial site guidance for 
assessment and follow -up of these criteria can be found  in the separate guidance 
document entitled, the pembrolizumab Event of Clinic al Interest Guidance for 
Potential DILI in Clinical Trials .   
To facilitate appropriate monitoring for signals of DILI associated with pembrolizumab, 
cases of concurrent DILI according to the criteria specified above require the following:  
• The event is to be reported to the sponsor as an adverse event of potential  DILI 
within 24  hours of discovery or notification of the event (ie, before additional etiologic 
investigations have been concluded) 
• The appropriate CRF (eg, Event CRF) that captures information necessary to 
facilitate the evaluation of treatment -emergent liver abnormalities is to be completed.  
• Workup to confirm DILI should be immediately initiated as described in the 
pembrolizumab Event of Clinical Interest Guidance for Potential DILI in Clinical T rials 
document.  Any confirmed event of DILI is  to be reported as a serious adverse event 
within 24 hours after confirmation of the event.  
Other events of hepatotoxicity and potential DILI are to be reported as serious adverse 
events if they meet the criteria for a serious adverse event defined in Section 9.2.2.2 .

CONFIDENTIAL    10.1.2.8  PRO Analysis Set  
The analysis used f or EORTC QLQ -C30, EORTC QLQ -HN35, and EQ -5D-5L will be 
performed using the PRO FAS(G) population, which constitutes randomized subjects  
defined by the FAS(G) population who have at least 1 PRO assessment available and 
have received at least 1 dose of the study medication.  Subjects in the PRO FAS(G) 
population will be included in the treatment group to which they are randomized.  
10.1.3  Covariates and Subgroups 
To explore the robustness of efficacy signal in phase 1b, iORR may also be estimated 
separately by PD-L1 status (positive/not positive)  or other covariates listed below . 
Besides the stratification factors for randomization in phase 3  of HPV status at baseline 
(HPV - negative vs HPV-positive) and ECOG performance status (0 vs 1), the following 
covariates will be used to examine efficacy and safety in subgroups or in multivariate analyses as appropriate:  
• Region  (South  America vs North America vs. EU vs. Asia  vs Other  or phase 1b; 
South America vs North America vs EU vs Japan vs Other Asia vs Other for 
phase 3) 
• Age at baseline: < 50, ≥ 50; < 65, ≥ 65; < 75, ≥ 75 years  
• Sex (female vs male)  
• Prior smoking (never vs former vs current)  
• HSV-1 serostatus  (positive vs negative)  
• HPV status (positive vs negative vs unknown) (phase 1b) 
• The sum of diameters of target lesions  
• Weight loss >5% in the previous 6 months  
• Primary tumor site(oral cavity vs oropharynx vs hypopharyn x vs. laryn x) 
• Brain metastasis status (baseline brain metastasis vs no baseline brain metastasis)  
• Prior radiotherapy  for the treatment of SCCHN  
• Extent of diseas e (metastatic vs locoregionally recurrent  only) 
• Prior lines of therapy in recurrent/metastatic setting (0, 1 or 2)  
• PD-L1 status at baseline (PD -L1 positive vs PD-L1 not positive)  
• Baseline CD8 + T cell density  
• Maximum blinded investigational product total volume per treatment administration ≥ 4 mL at highest concentration (yes, no)

CONFIDENTIAL    10.2 Sample Size Considerations  
10.2.1  Sample Size Considerations  for Phase 1b  
In testing for the null hypothesis H0 that the combination of talimogene laherparepvec 
and pembrolizumab has a DLT rate ≤ 10% versus the alternative hypothesis (Ha) that the true DLT rate is ≥ 33%, the sample size goal is to h ave ≥ 80% power for 
a 1-sided ≤ 10% significance level test to reject H0 when Ha is true ( Goldman AI, 1987).  
With up to 3 safety interim analy ses, the sequential stopping rules shown in Table 1  
(Section 3.1.1 ) gives 81.6% power for a 7.7% 1- sided significance level test.  A 
maximum of 18 DLT -evaluable subjects  will be enrolled.  If > 18 subjects receive the 
combination they will contribute to the overall safety analysis, but only the first 18 DLT-evaluable will be considered in the decision to declare the combination safe.  
Subjects may be replaced if they are not evaluable for DLT to obtain 18 DLT -evaluable 
subjects (eg, a subject did not receive study treatment, or ended the study treatment before completion of DLT evaluation period for a reason other than experiencing a DLT).   
The null hypothesis may be accepted and the combination declared safe prior to 
18 DLT-evaluable subjects if it can be definitively determined that the stopping rule will 
not be exceeded with additional subjects.  
An expansion cohort of up to an additional 22 treated subjects will be enrol led so there 
will be 40 treated subjects in total .  The decision to proceed to phase 3 will consider 
safety data in all treated subjects and efficacy among all treated subjects excluding 
those with locoregionally advanced disease with disease progression o r recurrence 
< 3 months after prior platinum -containing curatively intended multimodal therapy.  The 
efficacy analysis is expected to include approximately 27 subjects. The decision to 
proceed to phase 3 will consider, for example, long -term tolerability a nd minimum 
efficacy consistent with pembrolizumab monotherapy historical data.   
The main efficacy endpoint in the phase 1b for the phase 3 decision will be the iORR 
(response per irRECIST by investigator assessment ) with or without confirmation of 
respons e.  Given the observed iORR, the Bayesian posterior probability will be 
calculated that the true combination iORR exceeds the expected iORR for 
pembrolizumab by an absolute amount (delta).  The expected iORR for pembrolizumab 
in the study population with 9 weeks minimum potential follow -up is approximately 11% 
and will be represented by a beta(2.2, 17.8) distribution with mean 0.11 and 
precision 20.0.  The iORR for the combination will be represented by a beta(0.2,1.8) 
distribution with mean 0.11 and precisi on 2.0.  Figure 1 provides the posterior probability

10.2.2  Sample Size Considerations  for Phase 3  
The primary endpoint for phase 3  is OS.  A hazard ratio (HR) (talimogene laherparepvec 
with pembrolizumab/placebo with pembrolizumab) of  0.7 for OS is hypothesized in the 
FAS(G) .  Assuming OS follow s a piece- wise exponential distribution  (Figure 3 ), the 
hypothesized HR translates into a relative increase of 43% (absolute increase of 
3.7 months) in median OS from 8.4 to 12.1 months.   The minimum statistically significant 
OS effect corresponds to an HR of 0. 769 (increase of median OS  of 2.6 months,  
8.4 to 11.0) at the OS interim anal ysis and 0. 801 (increase of 2.1 months, 8. 4 to 10.5) at 
the OS primary analysis.

power for a 2- sided 0.05 significance level test is 336 ( Lan and DeMets, 1983) .  
Assuming approximately 75% of subjects have an OS event at the time of OS primary 
analysis, the sample size is estimated to be 450 (225 per arm).  The OS event goal is 
adjusted for the interim efficacy analysis but not for the interim futility assessment ; 
however, the power loss due to futility is < 1%  if considered binding.  Assuming 50% of 
cumulative enrollment is accrued after 2/3 of total enrollment period (that is, a concave shape of the cumulated enrollment curve) and exponential distributions for loss to follow -up with an annual rate of 5%  per year for OS, Table 9  displays  the timing of 
analyses based on an average enrollment rates at 21 subjects  per month .

In addition to the hypothesis test for the primary endpoint, statistical tests for the 
secondary endpoints of ORR, PFS, iORR, and iPFS will be performed conditional on 
rejecting the OS null hypothesis . Table 10 shows event goals (or analysis time) based 
on hypothesized effect sizes and simulated powers for testing 5 endpoints.  The 
simulated powers are based on the Maur er-Bretz graphic al multiple testing procedure 
(Maurer and Bretz, 2013 ) assuming a concurrent primary analysis of all hypotheses .  
Details of the multiple testing procedure are described in Section  10.5.1 .

10.3 Access to Individual Subject Treatment Assignments by Sponsor  or 
Designees 
Unblinding and potentially unblinding i nformation for subjects and investigators should 
not occur prior to the study being formally unblinded (eg, the formal unblinding may 
occur at the final analysis rather than at the interim or primary analysis) except as 
specified (eg, Section 5.2 and Section 9.2.2 ).  The study team, with exceptions noted 
above, will remain blinded until either results of the OS interim analysis are 
communicated or otherwise the OS prim ary analysis.  To support the review of 
unblinded safety and efficacy data by the Data Monitoring Committee ( DMC ), an 
external biostatistics group will be responsible for analyzing the data  per the DMC 
charter .  The sponsor study personnel will remain blinded with exceptions where 
necessary for study conduct (eg, processing and analyzing biomarkers, regulatory safety 
reporting requirements).  
10.4 Planned Analyses  
10.4.1  Interim Analyses  
DLT interim safety analyses are planned and conducted by the study team for the phase 1b, with data being review by a DLRT.  
Interim analysis of safety monitoring and futility analysis based on OS prior to the primary analysis of OS in phase 3 will be conducted by an external independent 
biostatistics group and reviewed by the DMC per the DMC charter.  The study team is 
responsible for conducting the primary analysis of OS and all subsequent analyses.  
10.4.1.1  DLT Safety Analysis (Phase 1b)  
The planned interim safety data reviews in phase 1b to evaluate DLT will be conducted 
according to timing/rules described in Table 1  (Section 3.1.1 ).  Data will be reviewed by 
a DLRT.  
10.4.1.2  Interim Safety Analysis (Phase 3)  
Two planned interim safety data reviews will occur after approximately 40 and 
100 subjects have been enrolled in phase 3 and have had an opportunity to be followed 
up for at least 6 weeks after receiving study treatment  and approximately every 
6 months after the DMC meeting for the OS interim analysis.  Survival data may be 
reviewed by the DMC from a safety perspective, therefore no multiplicity adjustment is needed.   Monitoring guidelines will be provided in the DMC charter .  An interim safety

CONFIDENTIAL    data review will also occur that includes the first 8 subjects enrolled with 3 or more 
randomized into treatment arm  from Japan in the phase 3 part of the study and have had 
the opportunity to be followed for at least 6 weeks after recei ving study treatment.   
Additional analyses may be conducted for Japan enrolled subjects as  needed for 
regulatory or safety.  
An additional, interim safety data review will occur when at least 10 subjects have 
received at least one treatment with a total volume >4 ml of 108 PFU/mL talimogene 
laherparepvec plus pembrolizumab and have had the opportunity to be followed up to 
6 weeks after receiving  the >  4 mL dose of 108 PFU/mL .  Data will be reviewed by the 
DLRT if it includes phase  1b subjects only, otherwise it will be reviewed by the DMC.  
It is not planned for the enrollment/randomization to be suspended during these ongoing 
phase 3 safety analyses.  
10.4.1.3  Interim OS Efficacy and Futility Analysis (Phase 3)  
OS Efficacy  
An OS interim efficacy analysis is planned when approximately 280 events have been 
observed.  The OS null hypothesis H 1 will be tested at a nominal alpha level determined 
by the Lans DeMets type spending function approximating the O’Brien -Fleming stopping 
boundary ( O’Brien and Fleming, 1979 ).  Assuming exactly 280 and 336 events at the 
interim and primary analysis, the interim and primary analysis nominal alpha levels will be 2.81% and 4.19 %, respectively.  The timing of the interim analysis was selected to 
ensure approximately 70% power in a potential scenario in which there is a non- constant 
OS effect with HR  = 0.95 prior to 3  months and HR = 0.618 thereafter.  The expected 
observed HR for this lag effect scenario is 0.718 and 0.700 at 280 and 336 events.   
Overall power for the lag effect scenario is about 89% whether or not futility is considered binding.   If the OS treatment effect is constant with HR  = 0.700, then the 
interim power will be about 78%.  
OS Futility  
If the null OS hypothesis H 1 is not rejected at the interim analysis, then OS futility will be 
evaluated by the DMC.   The futility criterion  will be an observed HR  > 0.92.   If there is no 
treatment effect on OS (HR of 1.0), there is a 76 % probability of declaring OS futile; 
however, the probability of falsely declaring futility is only about 1 % given a constant  OS 
HR of  0.70 and it is about 2% for the above lag effect sc enario.  T he futility analys is in 
the phase 3 study will be  non-binding.

CONFIDENTIAL    The null hypothesis tests for ORR,  PFS, iORR, and iPFS  will be tested  if the OS null 
hypothesis H 1 is rejected  at either the OS interim or primary analysis.   The analysis of 
ORR and iORR will include the subset of the FAS(G) with at least 19 weeks minimum 
potential follow -up (ie, week  18 response assessment +1 week window).   If the null OS 
Hypothesis, H 1, is rejected at the interim analysis, the study will continue to the OS 
primary analysis (ie, follow -up continued), if required, to perform the primary analysis for 
any secondary hypothesis that had an interim analysis at the OS interim analysis with its 
null not rejected.  
At the time of the interim analysis, Amgen senior management will make the decision to 
unblind the study team based on the DMC’s recommendation. 
Interim versus Primary Efficacy Analysis of Secondary Hypothesis  
The earliest planned OS analysis will be considered primary for ORR and iORR that 
includes at least 390 subjects in the ORR and iORR analyses ; otherwise, interim 
analyses of ORR and iORR will be performed with an O’Brien- Fleming nominal alpha 
level and the primary analysis of ORR and iORR will be performed at the first 
subsequent planned OS analysis that includes all FAS(G)  subjects in the ORR and 
iORR analyses  (ie, the OS primary or final analysis ). 
The earliest planned OS analysis will be considered primary for PFS that includes at least 330 PFS events; otherwise, an interim analysis of PFS will be performed with an 
O’Brie n-Fleming nominal alpha level and the primary analysis of PFS will be performed 
at the first subsequent planned OS analysis with at least 360 PFS events.  
The earliest planned OS analysis will be considered primary for iPFS that includes at least 300 iPFS e vents; otherwise an interim analysis of iPFS will be performed with an 
O’Brien -Fleming nominal alpha level and the primary analysis of iPFS will be performed 
at the first subsequent planned OS analysis with at least 336  iPFS events.

10.4.2 Blinded Independent Central Review for Secondary Endpoints 
A blinded Independent Central Review (BICR) by a third party imaging laboratory of the 
tumor imaging data will be considered in the event of a statistically and clinically 
significant investigator assessed RECIST v1.1 ORR and/or PFS effect.  An initial audit 
will be performed with approximately 116 (26%) randomly selected subjects from the 
FAS(G). 
The investigator assessed estimate of the ORR effect in the FAS(G) will be considered 
consistent with a BICR assessed estimate if a high degree of concordance is observed 
at the subject level in the initial audit sample for achievement of an objective response 
pooling all subjects.  Specifically, consistency will be declared if the null hypothesis of a 
kappa concordance statistic of 0.65 or less for an objective response is rejected at a 
1-sided 2.5% significance level.  Assuming an overall ORR of 30% and a true kappa of 
0.90, the initial audit size will provide approximately 90% power and rejection of the null 
hypothesis will require and observed kappa statistic of at least 0.77, 89% agreement, 
and a maximum investigator versus BICR ORR absolute difference about 11% in the 
audit sample. 
The consistency of the investigator-assessed estimate of the PFS effect in the FAS(G) 
with a BICR-assessed estimate will be evaluated with a 2-stage procedure  
(Dodd et al 2011 ).  The PFS consistency criterion will be achievement of a 1-sided 
95% CI for the BICR-assessed PFS log HR below zero.  The initial audit sample would 
provide a greater than 80% probability of achieving the PFS consistency criterion for 
Stage 1 of the procedure if the investigator-assessed PFS HR is 0.70 in the FAS(G) with 
360 events and the correlation is 0.85 between the

be re -calculated based on a bootstrap estimate of the correlation obtained from the initial 
audit and the observed investigator -assessed PFS HR in the FAS(G). Stage  1 will be 
considered with a complete- case BICR if the final audit  size exceeds 300 subjects, 
67% of the FAS(G).  Stage 1 may alternatively be assessed with the initial audit if it is 
not feasible to achieve an 80% probability of consistency.  
10.4.3  Dose Level Review Team  
A DLRT consisting of the Sponsor study team, including at least one medical monitor , 
safety representative, and biostatistician, at least one representative of the Merck study 
team, and at least one investigator participating in the study who has recruited subjects into the phase 1b part of the study, will review the safety data to evaluate possible drug 
effects and DLT.  The DLRT  will recommend either to enroll more subjects for DLT 
evaluation in phase 1b, to prematurely stop enrollment into phase 1b, or to declare that 
the combination is tolerable based on the criteria described in Table 1 . 
10.4.4  Data Monitoring Committee  
An independent, external to the sponsor , mult idisciplinary DMC consisting of a 
biostatistician and 2 clinicians that collectively have experience in the management of 
subjects with SCCHN and in the conduct and monitoring of randomized clinical trials will 
be established before the start of the phase 3 part of the trial.  The DMC will monitor the 
overall conduct of the phase 3 trial including OS futility based on the criterion in 
Section 10.4.1.3 . 
10.4.5  Primary  Analysis 
10.4.5.1  Primary Analysis Phase 1b  
For the phase 1b part of the study, the primary analysis will occur when the last subject enrolled has had the opportunity to complete the 9- week response assessment.  
10.4.5.2  Primary Analysis Phase 3  
For the phase 3 part of the study, the timing for the primary analys is of OS will be 
event -driven based on the FAS(G) .  The event goal for OS is 336.  Detailed approximate 
timings of the analyses are shown in Table 9 . 
10.4.6  Follow -Up Analysis for Phase 1b 
For the phase 1b part of the study, the primary analysis will be repeated 1 year 
after the last subject enrolled.

The final analysis of the study will be conducted after the last subject enrolled has had 
the opportunity to complete the long -term follow -up (ie, 36 months after the last subject 
is enrolled in the FAS .  
10.5 Planned Methods of Analysis  
10.5.1  General Considerations 
For the phase 1b part of the study, the DLT analysis set will be used to summarize the 
subject incidence of DLT and, unless specified otherwise,  the SAS will be used for all 
analyses of safety .  The EAS, FAS, and the FAS excluding subject in the EAS will be 
used for all  efficacy analyses .  
For the phase 3 part of the study, the efficacy analyses will be conducted on the  FAS(G) .  
Treatment effects on efficacy endpoints will be evaluated and compared between the 
2 treatment arms according to the treatment as randomized.   Formal treatment 
comparisons will be performed on the primary endpoints and the 4 key secondary 
endpoints.   The SAS(G), unless specified otherwise, will be used for all analyses of 
safety in the phase  3.  Descriptive efficacy and safety analyses of subjects randomized 
after the global last subject enrolled (LSE[ G]) will be provided separately at the time of 
the OS interim and primary analyses.  
In principle, summary statistics including mean, standard deviation, median, first and 
third quartiles, will be provided for continuous variables.  Frequency and percentage will be summarized by treatment arm for binary and categorical variables.  Proportions and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals will be based on normal approximations and the treatment comparison will be based on a Cochran- Mantel -Haenszel test.  Exact tests 
will be considered for subgroup analyses when the cell size is considered small.   
Time -to-event endpoints will be estimated using the K -M method.  Stratified Log-rank 
test statistics and associated p -values will also be calculated.  Hazard ratios will be 
estimated using stratified Cox PH models.  
Descriptive statistics will be provided for efficac y, safety, talimogene laherparepvec 
DNA, and biomarker endpoints as appropriate.   
Multiple statistical hypothesis tests will be conducted which include testing for the primary endpoint of OS and the 4 secondary endpoints ( ORR, PFS,  iORR, and iPFS  
response evaluation by investigator using RECIST  v1.1 and irRECIST) at multiple 
analysis time points.  To control the study -level overall Type I error, a graphical  multiple

CONFIDENTIAL    Phase 3 
The efficacy analyses will be conducted on the FAS(G) .  Treatment effects on efficacy 
endpoints will be evaluated and compared between the 2 treatment arms according to 
the treatment as randomized.  
For analys is of the primary endpoint OS, a stratified log- rank test will be used as the 
primary method for testing the null hypothesis of no treatment difference.  The randomization factors, along with PD -L1 status at baseline (PD -L1 positive vs PD -L1 not 
positive), will be used as stratif ication factors.  A hazard ratio will be estimated using the 
Cox proportional hazards (PH) model stratified by the randomization factors per IVR and 
PD-L1 status at baseline with Efron’s method ( Efron 1977) used to handle ties.  
Kaplan- Meier time to event curves will be presented based on randomized treatment 
arm. 
Statistical testing of OS will follow the multiple hypothesis testing procedure described in 
Section 10.5.1. 
Covariates to define subgroups for analys is of efficacy endpoints will include, but not be 
limited to, the randomization stratification factors.  
10.5.3  Secondary Efficacy  Endpoint s 
All endpoints of the phase 1b will be descriptively analyzed.  
ORR and iORR will be treated as binary endpoint s and summarized by treatment arm as 
randomized with associated 95% CIs, and with treatment comparisons based on the 
Cochran- Mantel -Haenszel test stratified by the randomization stratification factors  and 
PD-L1 at baseline.  Following the intent -to-treat principle, subjects who do not have any 
follow up tumor assessments will be determined to be non -complete responders.  
Analysis of PFS  and iPFS  will follow the analysis described for the primary endpoint of 
OS.   
Hypothesis testings for ORR,  PFS, iORR, and iPFS  are described in the multiple testing 
procedure in Section  10.5.1.  Analyses of the remaining secondary endpoints in phase 3 
will be descriptive.  
CRR, iCRR,  DCR, and iDCR will be summarized by treatment arm as randomized 
(phase 3).  Subjects who do not have any follow -up tumor assessments will be 
determined to be non- responders  for CRR and iCRR or to not have had a response of

and estimated using the Kaplan- Meier method.  
10.5.4  Safety Endpoints 
Subject incidence of all treatment emergent adverse events will be tabulated by system 
organ class and preferred term.  Treatment -emergent adverse events are defined as 
adverse events with an onset from the first dose of study therapy up to 30 days after the last dose of study therapy.  Tables of fatal adverse events, serious adverse events, adverse events, disease related events leading to withdrawal from investigational product or other protocol required therapies, and significant treatment emergent adverse events will also be provided.  
Subject incidence of disease rela ted events  (DREs)  and fatal disease related events will 
be tabulated by system organ class and preferred term.   
Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities will be used to code adverse events to a system organ class and a preferred term within the system organ class .  The CTCAE 
version 4.0 will be used to grade severity of adverse events.  
Summary statistics over time by treatment group will be provided for selected key safety 
laboratory endpoints.  Shifts in grades of these safety laboratory endpoints between the baseline and the worst on- study value will be tabulated by treatment group. 
The ECG measurements from this clinical study will performed as per standard of care for routine safety monitoring, rather than for purposes of assessment of potential QTc 
effect.  Summaries and statistical analyses of ECG measurements are not planned.  
The qPCR analysis result of talimogene laherparepvec DNA in swab samples taken from 
exterior of occlusive dressing, surface of injected lesions, and oral mucosa  suspected to 
be herpetic in origin (if any) in phase 1b samples will be summarized.  The incidence 
and percentage of subjects who develop anti -pembrolizumab antibodies (binding and if 
positive, neutralizing) at any time will be tabulated. 
Potential or known unintended exposure to talimogene laherparepvec /placebo, related 
suspected signs or symptoms, and detection of talimogene laherparepvec DNA in a 
subject’ s household member, caregiver, or healthcare provider will be reported.

provided in a supplemental statistical analysis plan  (SSAP) .  Comparisons between 
groups for the QLQ -C30 GHS/QoL subscale (secondary endpoint) and select subscales 
from the QLQ- C30 and QLQ -HN35 will be analy zed as per the PRO SSAP.  
10.5.6  Health State Utility Estimates  
For the EQ-5D-5L questionnaire, two scores will be estimated; the utility score calculated 
from the 5 domains using a scoring algorithm and the VAS score based on the 0- 100 
feeling thermometer.  Changes from baseline will be summarized and at specified time 
point s of interest, differences between treatment groups for each defined score will be 
analyzed.  The calculation of scores and methods for handling missing data will be based on the questionnaire’s standard scoring guidelines.  Details for deriving the HSU estimates and the full analysis plan will be provided in the  PRO SSAP. 
11. REGULATORY OBLIGATIONS  
11.1 Informed Consent  
An initial sample informed consent form is provided for the investigator to prepare the 
informed consent document to be used at his or her site.  U pdates to the template are to 
be communicated formally in writing from the sponsor Clinical Study Manager to the 
investigator .  The written informed consent document is to be prepared in the 
language(s) of the potential patient population.  
Before a subject’s participation in the clinical study, the investigator is responsible for 
obtaining written informed consent from the subject  after adequate explanation of the aims, methods, anticipated benefits, and potential hazards of the study and before any 
protocol -specific screening procedures or any investigational product (s) is/are 
administered.  
The investigator is also responsible for asking the subject if the subject has a primary 
care physician and if the subject agrees to have his/her primary care physician informed 
of the subject’s participation in the clinical study.  If the subject agrees to such 
notification, the investigator is to inform the subject’s primary care physician of the 
subject’s participation in the clinical study.  If the subject does not have a primary care physician and the investigator will be acting in that capacity, the investigator is to 
document such in the subject’s medical record.

notification of  the primary care physician is to be documented in the subject’s medical 
records, and the informed consent form  is to be signed and personally dated by the 
subject and by the person who conducted the informed consent discussion.  The original signed inform ed consent form is to be retained in accordance with institutional policy, 
and a copy of the signed consent form is to be provided to the subject.  
If a potential subject is illiterate or visually impaired and does not have a legally acceptable representative, the investigator must provide an impartial witness to read the 
informed consent form to the subject and must allow for questions.  Thereafter, both the subject and the witness must sign the informed consent form to attest that informed consent was freely given and understood. 
11.2 Institutional Review Board/Independent  Ethics Committee  
A copy of the protocol, proposed informed consent form, other written subject 
information, and any proposed advertising material must be submitted to the IRB/IEC  for 
written approval.  A copy of the written approval of the protocol and informed consent form must be received by the sponsor before recruitment of subjects into the study and shipment of investigational product.  
The investigator must submit and, where necessary, obtain approval from the IRB/IEC  
for all subsequent protocol amendments and changes to the informed consent document.  The investigator is to notify the IRB/IEC  of deviations from the protocol or 
serious adverse events occurring at the site and other adverse event reports received 
from the sponsor, in accordance with local procedures.  
The investigator is responsible for obtaining annual IRB/IEC  approval/renewal 
throughout the duration of the study.  Copies of the investigator ’s reports and the 
IRB/IEC  continuance of approval must be sent to  the sponsor . 
11.3 Subject Confidentiality  
The investigator must ensure that the subject’s confidentiality is maintained for 
documents submitted to the sponsor .

CONFIDENTIAL    study’s completion or early termination and send a copy of the notification to the 
sponsor .  
Subjects may be eligible for continued treatment with investigational product (s) by an 
extension protocol or as provided for by the local country’s regulatory mechanism.  
However, the sponsor reserves  the unilateral right, at its sole discretion, to determine 
whether to supply investigational product (s) and by what mechanism, after termination of 
the study and before the product(s) is/are available commercially.  
12.2 Study Documentation and Archive  
The investigator is to maintain a list of appropriately qualified persons to whom he/she 
has delegated study duties.  All persons authorized to make entries and/or corrections on CRFs will be included on the Amgen Delegation of Authority Form.  
Source documents are original documents, data, and records from which the subject’s CRF data are obtained.  These include but are not limited to hospital records, clinical and office charts, laboratory and pharmacy records, diaries, microfiches, radiographs, and correspondence.  
In this study, the IVR system captures the following data points and these are 
considered source data:   subject identification number and randomization number . 
CRF entries may be considered source data if the CRF is the site of the original recording (ie,  there is no other written or electronic record of data).  In this study, 
EQ-5D-5L, QLQ- C30, and QLQ -H&N35  can be used as source documents.  
The Investigator  and study staff are responsible for maintaining a comprehensive and 
centralized filing system of all study -related (essential) documentation, suitable for 
inspection at any time by representatives from the sponsor and/or applicable regulatory 
authorities.   
Elements to include:  
• Subject files containing completed CRFs , informed consent forms, and subject 
identification list  
• Study files containing the protocol with all amendments, Investigato r’s Brochure, 
copies of prestudy documentation, and all correspondence to and from the IRB/IEC  
and the sponsor  
Product:  Talimogene Laherparepvec  
Protocol Number:  20130232  
Date:  11 May 2018  Page 128  of 158 
CONFIDENTIAL    • Investigational product -related correspondence including Proof of Receipts (POR ), 
Investigational Product Accountability Record(s) , Return of Investigational Product 
for Destruction Form(s), Final Investigational Product Reconciliation Statement, as 
applicable. 
• Non-investigational product(s) and or medical device(s) documentation, as 
applicable. 
In addition, all original source documents supporting entries in the CRFs must be 
maintained and be readily available.  
Retention of study documents will be governed by the Clinical Trial Agreement.  
12.3 Study Monitoring and Data Collection  
The sponsor representative(s) and regulatory authority inspectors are resp onsible for 
contacting and visiting the investigator for the purpose of inspecting the facilities and, 
upon request, inspecting the various records of the clinical study (eg, CRFs and other 
pertinent data) provided that subject confidentiality is respected . 
The sponsor ’s clinical monitor is responsible for verifying the CRFs at regular intervals 
throughout the study to verify adherence to the protocol; completeness, accuracy, and 
consistency of the data; and adherence to local regulations on the conduct of clinical 
research.  The clinical monitor is to have access to subject medical records and other 
study -related records needed to verify the entries on the CRFs. 
The investigator agrees to cooperate with the clinical monitor to ensure that any 
problems detec ted in the course of these monitoring visits, including delays in 
completing CRFs, are resolved.  
In accordance with ICH GCP and the sponsor’s audit plans, this study may be selected for audit by representatives from Amgen’s Global R&D Compliance Audit (or designees).  
Inspection of site facilities (eg, pharmacy, protocol -required therapy storage areas, 
laboratories) and review of study -related records will occur to evaluate the study conduct 
and compliance with the protocol, ICH GCP, and applicable regulatory requirements.   
Data capture for this study is planned to be electronic:  
• All source documentation supporting entries into the CRFs must be maintained and 
readily available.  
• Updates to CRFs will be automatically documented through the software’s “audit 
trail”. 
Product:  Talimogene Laherparepvec  
Protocol Number:  20130232  
Date:  11 May 2018  Page 129  of 158 
CONFIDENTIAL    • To ensure the quality of clinical data across all subjects and sites, a clinical data 
management review is performed on subject data received by the sponsor .  During 
this review, subject data are checked for consistency, omissions, and any apparent 
discrepancies.  In addition, the data are reviewed for adherence to the protocol and 
GCP.  To resolve any questions arising from the clinical data management review 
process, data queries are created in the EDC system database for site resolution 
and subsequently closed by the EDC system or by a sponsor  reviewer.  
• The investigator  signs only the Investigator  Verification Form for this EDC study or 
the investigator applies an electronic signature in the EDC system if the study is set 
up to accept an electronic signature.  This signature indicates that investigator 
inspected or reviewed the data on the CRF, the data queries, and agrees with the content.  
The sponsor  (or designee) will perform self -evident corrections to obvious data errors in 
the clinical trial da tabase, as documented in the Study Specific Self Evident Corrections 
Plan.  Examples of obvious data errors that may be corrected by the sponsor (or 
designee) include deletion of obvious duplicate data (eg, same results sent twice with 
the same date with different visit -week 4 and early termination) and clarifying “other, 
specify” if data are provided (eg, race, physical examination).  Each investigative site will 
be provided a list of the types of corrections applied to study data at the initiation of the 
trial and at study closeout.  
12.4 Investigator  Responsibilities for Data Collection 
The investigator  is responsible for comply ing with the requirements for all assessments 
and data collection (including subjects not receiving protocol -required therapies) as 
stipulated in the protocol for each subject in the study.  For subjects who withdraw prior 
to completion of all protocol -required visits and are unable or unwilling to continue the  
Schedule of Assessments ( Table 5 , Table  6, and Table 7) the investigator can search 
publically available records [where permitted]) to ascertain survival status.   This ensures 
that the data set(s) produced as  an outcome of the study is/are as comprehensive as 
possible.  
12.5 Language 
All written information and other material to be used by subjects and investigative staff must use vocabulary and language that are clearly understood.  CRFs must be 
completed in Englis h.  TRADENAMES
 (if used) for concomitant medications may be  
entered in the local language.  
12.6 Publication Policy  
To coordinate dissemination of data from this study, Amgen encourages the formation of a publication committee consisting of several investigators and appropriate Amgen staff,  
Product:  Talimogene Laherparepvec  
Protocol Number:  20130232  
Date:  11 May 2018  Page 130  of 158 
CONFIDENTIAL    the governance and responsibilities of which are set forth in a Publication Charter .  The 
committee is expected to solicit input and assistance from other investigators and to 
collaborate with authors and Amgen staff as appropriate as defined in the Publication 
Charter .  Membership on the committee (both for investigators and Amgen staff) does 
not guarantee authorship .  The criteria described below  are to be met for every 
publication.  
Authorship of any publications resulting from this study will be determined on the basis 
of the Recommendations for the Conduct, Reporting, Editing, and Publication of  
Scholarly Work in Medical Journals (International Committee of Medical Journal Editors,  2013, updated 2014), which states: 
• Author ship credit should be based on (1) substantial contributions to conception and 
design, acquisition of data, or analysis and interpretation of data; (2) drafting the 
article or revising it critically for important intellectual content; (3) final approval of  the 
version to be published (4) agreement to be accountable for all aspects of the work 
in ensuring that questions related to the accuracy or integrity of any part of the work are appropriately investigated and resolved.  Authors  should meet conditions  1, 2, 
and 3. 
• When a large, multi center  group has conducted the work, the group should  identify 
the individuals who accept direct responsibility for the manuscript.  These individuals 
should fully meet the criteria for authorship defined above.  
• Acquisition of  funding, collection of data, or general supervision of the research 
group, alone, does not justify authorship. 
• All persons designated as authors should qualify for authorship, and all those who 
qualify should be listed.  
• Each author should  have participated sufficiently in the work to take public 
responsibility for appropriate portions of the content. 
All publications (eg, manuscripts, abstracts, oral/slide presentations, book chapters) 
based on this study must be submitted to Amgen for review.  The Clinical Trial Agreement among the institution, investigator , and Amgen will detail the procedures for, 
and timing of, Amgen’s review of publications.  
12.7 Compensation  
Any arrangements for compensation to subjects for injury or illness that arises in the study are described in the Compensation for Injury section of the Informed Consent that is available as a separate document.

CONFIDENTIAL    Appendix A .  Additional Safety Assessment Information  
Adverse Event Grading Scale  
The Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0 is available 
at the following location:  
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm  
Drug -induced Liver Injury Reporting & Additional Assessments  
Reporting  
To facilitate appropriate monitoring for signals of D rug Induced Liver Injury (D ILI), cases 
of concurrent AST  or ALT and total bilirubin and/or  INR elevation according to the criteria 
specified in Section 6.4 require the following:  
• The event is to be reported to the sponsor as a serious adverse event within 
24 hours  of discovery or notification of the event (ie, before additional etiologic 
investigations have been concl uded)  
• The appropriate CRF (eg, Event CRF) that captures information necessary to 
facilitate the evaluation of treatment -emergent liver abnormalities is to be completed 
and sent to the  sponsor .  
Other events of hepatotoxicity and potential DILI are to be re ported as serious adverse 
events if they meet the criteria for a serious adverse event defined in Section 9.2.2.2 . 
Additional Clinical Assessments and Observation  
All subjects in whom investigational product(s) is/are withheld (either permanently or 
conditionally) due to potential DILI as specified in Section 6.4.1  and Section 6.4.2  or who

CONFIDENTIAL    Appendix D .  Radiological Guidance for Assessment of Disease Response 
Initially developed in 2000 and modified in 2009, RECIST guidelines provide a standard 
approach to solid tumor measurement and definitions for objective assessment of 
change in tumor size in adult and pediatric cancer clinical trials.  More recently, however, to account for the unique tumor response characteristics seen with treatment with immunotherapeutic agents, standard RECIST v1.1 will be adapted (irRECIST) to assess 
tumor responses in this study  for treatment decisions  only. Immunotherapeutic agents 
such as pembrolizumab and talimogene laherparepvec may produce antitumor effects 
by potentiating endogenous cancer -specific immune responses.  The response patterns 
seen with such an  approach may extend beyond the typical time course of responses 
seen with cytotoxic agents, and can manifest a clinical response after an initial increase 
in tumor burden or even the appearance of new lesions.  Standard RECIST v1.1 
therefore may not be th e optimal method for  response assessment of 
immunotherapeutic agents. Immune- related RECIST (irRECIST) is RECIST v1.1 
adapted to account for the unique tumor response seen with immuno-therapeutics.  irRECIST will be used by local site investigators to assess tumor response and progression, and make treatment decisions.  Adaptations for irRECIST include the 
following:  
• For initial progressive disease (PD), tumor assessment should be repeated  
≥4 weeks later in order to confirm PD with the option of continuing treatment per 
below while awaiting radiologic confirmation of progression. 
• If repeat imaging shows < 20% tumor burden compared to nadir, stable or improved 
previous new lesion (if identified as cause for initial PD), and stable/improved 
non-target disease (if identified as cause for initial PD), treatment may be 
continued/resumed.  
• In determining whether or not the tumor burden has increased or decreased, all target lesions as well as non- target lesions should be considered. 
Note:  For phase  3 only, investigators will also be asked to assess and document tumor 
response per standard RECIST v1.1.  However, RECIST v1.1 response assessment 
should NOT be used in treatment decisions. 
Method of Measurement of Tumor Lesions:  
CT scans (or MRI):  
Computed tomography (CT) scans by contrast -enhanced or spiral scan (or magnetic 
resonance imaging [MRI] scan) will be performed to evaluate tumor response for visceral

Protocol Number:  20130232  
Date:  11 May 2018  Page 143  of 158 
CONFIDENTIAL    or nodal/soft tissue disease (including lymph nodes).  The same method of assessment 
and the same technique should be used to characterize each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow -up.  A switch from contrast enhanced CT to 
noncontrast CT or to MRI (or vice versa) should not preclude response assessment if, in the judgment of the site radiologist, there is no significant difference in the assessment 
by changing modalities.  This may occur if a subject has developed a medical 
contraindication to intravenous contrast for CT scans while on trial.  This change would require the preapproval of the sponsor medical monitor.  
Positron Emission Tomography (
PET)/CT Scans:   
If a combined PET/CT scan is performed at the discretion of the investigator, the CT portion of that exam should not be substituted for the dedicated CT exams required by this protocol.  The PET portion of the CT may introduce additional data which may bias the investigator assessment of response if it is not routinely or serially performed.  However, if the investigator or the site radiologist can document that the CT performed 
as part of a PET/CT is of identical diagnostic quality to a diagnostic CT (with intravenous 
and oral contrast) then the CT portion of the PET/CT can be used for tumor measurements.  
Ultrasound:   
Ultrasound (US) should not be used as a primary method to assess lesion measurements in response to treatment.  
Baseline Lesions  
Measurable Lesions : 
Measurable lesions are defined at baseline as lesions that can be accurately measured 
in at least one dimension (ie, longest diameter for non- nodal lesions and short axis for 
lymph nodes will be measured and followed) with a minimum size of:  
• ≥ 10 mm by CT scan (CT scan slice thickness no greater than 5 mm) or MRI  
• A lymph node must be ≥ 15 mm in short axis when assessed by CT scan or MRI.  
Non-Measurable Lesions : 
All other lesions, including small lesions (longest diameter < 10 mm or pathologic al 
lymph nodes with ≥ 10 mm but < 15 mm short axis) and other truly non-measurable 
lesions are considered non- measurable.  Examples of non- measurable lesions include 
some bone lesions,  ascites, pleural/pericardial effusion,  lymphangitic involvement of the

CONFIDENTIAL    skin or (lymphangitis cutis/pulmonis),  cystic lesions,  and groups of lesions that are small 
and numerous.  
Documentation of “Target” , “Non -Target” and “New” Lesions:  
Baseline evaluations will be used to prospectively identify all sites of disease present as  
close as possible to the enrollment and never greater than or equal to 28 days before 
the enrollment date.  Sites  of disease will be characterized as either target, non-target 
lesions  or new lesions . 
Baseline Documentation of Target Lesions: 
Up to 10 target lesions with a maximum of 5 per organ (p hase 1b) and up to 5 target 
lesions with a maximum of 2  per organ ( phase  3) will be chosen to measure over the 
course of therapy.  Pathological lymph nodes that are defined as measurable must meet 
the criterion of  a short axi s of ≥ 15 mm by CT scan in order to be identified as target 
lesions.  
Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with longest 
diameter) and suitability for accurate repeated measurements by radiographic  imaging.  
In situations where larger lesions cannot be accurately measured repeatedly (eg, near 
the diaphragm where respiratory changes may affect measurements), smaller lesions that meet criteria for measurability may be selected instead. Target lesions must not be 
chosen from a previously irradiated field unless there has been documented tumor progression in that field prior to enrollment.  The distribution of the target lesions should be representative of the subject’s overall disease (eg, largest lesions per organ).   
A sum of t he diameters (longest for non- nodal lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) for all 
target lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum diameters.  The 
baseline sum of diameters will be used as reference by which to characterize the 
objective tumor response.   
Baseline Documentation of Non- Target Lesions:  
Any measurable lesions that w ere not chosen as target lesions and pathological lymph 
nodes with short axis ≥  10 mm but <  15 mm, as well as non- measurable lesions  should 
be identified as non- target lesions.  Non -target lesions are evaluated at each timepoint 
but measurements are not required.

CONFIDENTIAL    Documentation of New Lesions:  
Any new lesion that appears during the course of study will be categorized as a new 
lesion.   New lesion s are evaluated at each timepoint but measurements are not required.  
Follow -up Assessment of Tumor Lesions:  
At each subsequent tumor assessment, the sum of diameters of target  lesions will 
contribute to the total tumor burden.  
Tumor Burden = sum of diameter of target lesions  
New lesions and non- target lesion  measurements are not required and these lesions 
should be followed qualitatively.  
For radiographically assessed non- nodal disease the convention will be used that if a 
lesion being measured decreases in size to ≤ 5 mm in diameter or if it is believed to be present and faintly seen but too small to measure, a value of 5 mm will be assigned.  If the non -nodal lesion subsequently increases in size to greater than or equal to 5 mm in 
one dimension, its true size will be recorded.  If it is in the opinion of the radiologist that 
the non -nodal lesion has likely disappeared, the measurement should be recorded as 
“0 mm”.  If a lymph node is nonpathological (<  10 mm), dimensions should be recorded 
as 5 mm. 
Response Evaluation:  
Evaluation of Objective Response:  
The subject response will be assessed based on tumor burden (the sum of diameters of 
target lesions) and qualitative assessment of non -target lesions per the definitions in 
Table 12.  The overall response is derived from time- point response assessments as 
described in Table 14.  Treatment decisions based on initial progressive disease are 
described in Table 13.

(Baseline Target , Non -target,  and New Lesions)  per irRECIST  
Complete Resp onse ( iCR): Disappearance of all lesions (whether measurable or not and 
whether baseline or new) and confirmation by a repeat, consecutive assessment no less than 4 weeks (28 days) from 
the date first documented  is required.  Any pathological lymph 
nodes (whether target or nontarget) must have reduction in short axis to <10 mm.  
Partial Response ( iPR): Decrease in tumor burden* ≥ 30% relative to baseline.  
Confirmation by a consecutive assessment at least 4 weeks 
(28 days) after first documentation required.  
Progressive Disease ( iPD): Increase in tumor burden* ≥ 20 % and at least 5 mm absolute increase compared to nadir (minimum recorded tumor burden)  
or qualitative worsening of non- target lesions or a new lesion.  
For irRECIST, c onfirmation by a repeat, consecutive

documented progressive dis ease is required .  
Stable Disease ( iSD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for iCR or iPR nor 
sufficient increase to qualify for iPD.

*Note: Clinically unstable patients are not required to undergo confirmation of PD. This decision is left to the 
discretion of the investigator.  
Confirmation of Disease Progression: 
In subjects who have initial evidence of radiological iPD, it is at the discretion of the PI 
whether to continue a subject on study treatment until repeat imaging is obtained based 
on their assessment of clinical stability.  Subjects may receive study treatment and tumor 
assessment sh ould be repeated ≥ 4 weeks later in order to confirm iPD by per site 
assessment.   
Clinical stability is defined as the following:  
1) absence of symptoms  and signs  indicating  clinically  significant  progression  of 
disease, including worsening of laboratory  values 
2) no decline in ECOG performance status

CONFIDENTIAL    3) absence of rapid progression of disease  
4) absence of progressive tumor at critical anatomical sites (eg, compression) requiring 
urgent alternative medical intervention   
In determining whether or not the tumor burden has increased or decreased per 
irRECIST, the local site investigator should consider all target and non- target lesions as 
well as any incremental new lesion(s).  
iPD is confirmed at repeat imaging if ANY of the following occur by irRECIST:  
• Tumor burden remains ≥ 20% and at least 5 mm absolute increase compared to 
nadir  
• Non-target disease resulting in initial PD is worse (qualitative assessment)  
• New lesion resulting in initial PD is worse (qualitative assessment)  
• Additional new lesion(s) since last evaluation  
• Additional new non- target progression since last evaluation (i.e non- target 
progression following initial iPD in which iPD was due to either increased target 
lesion tumor burden or a new lesion but was not confirmed on repeat imaging).  
Note :  Rapid clinical deterioration does not require confirmation of iPD 
If repeat imaging confirms iPD due to any of the scenarios listed above, subjects will be 
discontinued from study therapy.  
NOTE :  If a subject has confirmed radiographic progression (ie, 2 scans at least 4 weeks 
apart demonstrating progressive disease) per irRECIST, but the subject is achieving a clinically meaningful benefit, and there is no further increase in the tumor burden at the confirmatory tumor imaging, an exception to continue treatment may be considered following consultation with the sponsor. 
iPD is not confirmed at repeat imaging if ALL of the following occur by irRECIST:  
• Tumor burden is < 20 % or < 5 mm absolute increase compared to nadir  
• Non-target disease resulting in initial iPD is stable or improved (qualitative 
assessment) 
• New lesion resulting in initial iPD is stable or improved (qualitative assessment)  
• No incremental new lesion(s) since last evaluation 
• No incremental new non- target progression since last evaluation 
If repeat imaging does not confirm iPD by irRECIST and the subject continues to be 
clinically stable, treatment may continue and follow the regular imaging schedule.  If iPD 
is confirmed by a consecutive assessment, the first date of iPD documented should be 
the date of iPD.  However, if iPD is not confirmed by a consecutive assessment but is

CONFIDENTIAL    again noted at a subsequent assessment, the date of iPD documented should be the 
second date of iPD to capture incremental benefit.  
When feasible, subjects should not be discontinued until progression is confirmed by the 
local site investigator /radiographic  assessment.  This allowance to continue treatment 
despite initial radiologic PD takes into account the observation that some subjects can 
have a transient tumor flare in the fir st few months after the start of immunotherapy, and 
then experience subsequent disease response.  New lesions will be documented on the 
CRF form.  
Confirmation of Response ( iCR or iPR): 
To be assigned a status of iCR or iPR changes in tumor measurements must be 
confirmed by consecutive repeat assessments performed no less than 4 weeks (28 days) after the criteria for response are first met.  
The confirmatory assessments for complete response ( CR)/partial response ( PR) should 
be completed as close to the 28 d ay period without waiting for the next scheduled 
assessment (ie, 9 weeks later in case of subjects on treatment and 12  weeks later for 
subjects in long term follow -up (LTFU ) who have ended treatment for reasons other than 
PD. 
In some circumstances it may b e difficult to distinguish residual disease from normal 
tissue.  When the evaluation of iCR depends on this determination, it is recommended 
that the residual lesion be investigated (ie,  biopsy) to confirm the iCR status.  
Subjects who have had Complete or Partial Removal/Reduction of the Lesion will be 
Evaluated as Follows : 
The procedure itself and all post -procedure lesion assessments should always be 
recorded in the CRF.  A completely resected lesion should be assigned a default code of 0 mm (for target l esions) or “absent” (for non -target lesions).  A partially resected lesion 
should be assigned its measurement post -procedure (for target lesions) or “present” (for 
non-target lesions).  If the resected lesion contains no cancer under pathology 
evaluation, subsequent tumor assessments post -procedure may be used for tumor 
burden calculations and/or determination of response.  If the resected lesion contains cancer or pathology results are unknown, the recorded tumor assessments post-procedure may be used for tumor burden calculations, but determination of visit 
overall response will be considered unable to evaluate (i UE or UE ) for response except 
in the case of iPD or PD .  Similarly, the visit overall response will be considered iUE and

for iPD and PD, respectively, is met based on the subset of lesions assessed.  
If the new tumor burden post -procedure is lower than the nadir before the procedure, 
then the new nadir will be set to the post procedure tumor burden.  Otherwise, the previous pre- procedure nadir will be retained as the nadir.  Subsequent assessments for 
iPD and PD  will be determined from the nadir.  
Merging Lesions  
When two or more target lesions merge, the smaller lesion should have 0 mm recorded for the current and all future assessments, and the larger lesion should have the longest diameter of the merged lesion recorded for the current assessment and be followed for future assessments.  When two or more non -target l esions merge, the smaller lesion 
should be recorded as absent for the current and all future assessments, and the larger lesion should be recorded as present for the current assessment and followed for future 
assessments.  If a target lesion merges with a non-target lesion, the non -target lesion 
should be absent for the current visit and all future assessments, and the target lesion 
should include both merged lesions for recording measurements.  New lesions and 
enlarging non -target lesions ar e measured qual itatively.  
Separating Lesions  
When a target lesion splits into 2 or more lesions, the largest measurable part of the split lesion should be considered to be the previously recorded target lesion with measurements provided for the current assessment and fol lowed for future 
assessments.   The dimensions of the split parts would still be target lesions . When a 
non-target lesion splits into 2 or more lesions, the split parts remain non- target lesions 
for the duration of the study .  Any new lesions that result from separating should be 
documented as lesions that were generated by separating and not truly new lesions.

(Phase III Only)  
For phase III only, investigators will be asked to obtain and document tumor responses 
per standard RECIST v1.1 along with those per irRECIST at every scheduled and unscheduled tumor assessment following the same target and non- target lesions 
determined for irRECIST tumor response assessment.  Clinical decisions for treatment, however, should only be made based on t umor assessment using irRECIST.  
Method of Measurement of Tumor Lesions: 
Note: Imaging scans obtained for irRECIST tumor response assessment should also be used for RECIST v1.1 assessment  
CT scans (or MRI):  
Computed tomography (CT) scans by contrast -enhanced or spiral scan (or magnetic 
resonance imaging [MRI] scan) will be performed to evaluate tumor response for visceral or nodal/soft tissue disease (including lymph nodes).  The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow -up.  A switch from contrast enhanced CT to 
noncontrast CT or to MRI (or vice versa) should not preclude response assessment if, in the judgment of the site radiologist, there is no significant difference in the assessment by changing modalities.  This may occur if a subject has developed a medical contraindication to intravenous contrast for CT scans while on trial.  This change would

Note: Tumor Lesions designated for irRECIST response assessment should also be used for RECIST v1.1. 
Baseline Lesions  
Measurable Lesions : 
Measurable lesions are defined at baseline as lesions that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (ie, longest diameter for non- nodal lesions and short axis for 
lymph nodes will be measured and followed) with a minimum size of:  
• ≥ 10 mm by CT scan (CT scan slice thickness no greater than 5 mm) or MRI  
A lymph node must be ≥ 15 mm in short axis when assessed by CT scan or MRI.  
Non-Measurable Lesions : 
All other lesions, including small lesions (longest diameter < 10 mm or pathological lymph nodes with ≥ 10 mm but < 15 mm short axis) and other truly non-measurable lesions are considered non- measurable.  Examples of non- measurable lesions include 
some bone lesions, ascites, pleural/pericardial effusion, lymphangitic involvement of the skin or (lymphangitis cutis/pulmonis), cystic lesions, and groups of lesions that are small and numerous.  
Docu mentation of “Target”, “Non- Target” and “New” Lesions:  
Baseline evaluations will be used to prospectively identify all sites of disease present as close as possible to the enrollment and never greater than or equal to 28 days before the enrollment date.  Sites of disease will be characterized as either target, non -target 
lesions or new lesions.  
Baseline Documentation of Target Lesions: 
Up to 5 target lesions (a maximum of 2 per organ) will be chosen to measure over the course of therapy (Phase III).  Pathological lymph nodes that are defined as measurable must meet the criterion of a short axis of ≥ 15 mm by CT scan in order to be identified as 
target lesions.  
Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with longest 
diameter) and suitability for accurate repeated measurements by radiographic imaging.

CONFIDENTIAL    In situations where larger lesions cannot be accurately measured repeatedly (eg, near 
the diaphragm where respiratory changes may affect measurements), smaller lesions that meet criteri a for measurability may be selected instead.  Target lesions must not be 
chosen from a previously irradiated field unless there has been documented tumor progression in that field prior to enrollment.  The distribution of the target lesions should 
be representative of the subject’s overall disease ( eg, largest lesions per organ).  
A sum of the diameters (longest for non- nodal lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) for all 
target lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum diameters.  The 
baseline sum of diameters will be used as reference by which to characterize the objective tumor response.   
Baseline Documentation of Non- Target Lesions:  
Any measurable lesions that were not chosen as target lesions and pathological lymph nodes with short ax is ≥ 10 mm but <  15 mm, as well as non- measurable lesions should 
be identified as non- target lesions.  Non -target lesions are evaluated at each timepoint 
but measurements are not required.  
Documentation of New Lesions:  
Any new lesion that appears during the course of study will be categorized as a new lesion. New lesions are evaluated at each timepoint but measurements are not required .  
Tumor Assessment per RECIST v1.1:  
At each subsequent tumor assessment after baseline, the sum of diameters of target lesions (longest for non -nodal lesions and short axis for nodal) will contribute to the total 
tumor burden.   
Tumor Burden = sum of diameter of target lesions  
New lesions and non- target lesion measurements are not required and these lesions 
should be followed qualitatively.  
Response Evaluation:  
Evaluation of Objective Response:  
The subject response will be assessed based on tumor burden (the sum of diameters of target lesions) and qualitative assessment of non -target lesions per the definitions in 
Table 15 .

CONFIDENTIAL    Table 15 .  Definition of Tumor Response for RECIST v1.1  
Evaluation of Target Lesions  
Complete Response (CR)  Disappearance of all non- nodal target lesions.  
Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or 
non-target) must have reduction in short axis to 
<10 mm. 
Partial Response (PR)  At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum 
diameters.  
Progressive Disease (PD)  At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of 
target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum 
on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is 
the smallest on study).  In addition to the relative 
increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. (Note:  the 
appearance of one or more new lesions is also 
considered progression)  
Stable Disease (SD)  Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor 
sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as 
reference the smallest sum diameter s while on 
study  
Unable to Evaluate (UE)  Any non -target lesion present at baseline which 
was not assessed or was unable to be evaluated leading to an inability to determine the status of that 
particular tumor for that time point  
Not Done (ND)  Scans were  not performed at this time point to 
evaluate target lesions  
Evaluation of Non -target Lesions  
Complete Response (CR)  Disappearance of all non-target lesions and 
normalisation of tumour marker level.  All lymph 
nodes must be non-pathological in size (<10m m 
short axis)  
Non-CR/Non -PD Persistence of one or more non -target lesion(s) . 
Progressive Disease (PD)  Unequivocal progression of existing non-target 
lesions. (Note:  the appearance of one or more new 
lesions is also considered progression).  
Unable to Ev aluate (UE)  Any non-target lesion present at baseline which was not assessed or was unable to be evaluated 
leading to an inability to determine the status of that 
particular tumor for that time point   
Not Done (ND)  Scans were not performed at this time point to 
evaluate target lesions  
RECIST  = Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors  
Target Lesions:  
• All target lesions (nodal or non -nodal) should have the actual measurements 
recorded at each subsequent evaluation even when very small (eg, 2  mm) if 
possible.  
• Any non- nodal target lesion that become ‘too small to measure’ a default value of 
5 mm should be assigned.  If the lesion has disappeared, 0 mm should be recorded . 
• Any nodal target lesion that become ‘too small to measure’ a default value of 5 mm 
should be assigned for its short axis.

Protocol Number:  20130232  
Date:  11 May 2018  Page 156  of 158 
CONFIDENTIAL    • Coalescing lesions:  If a plane is maintained in aiding the demarcation of the 
2 lesions, then the maximal diameter of each individual lesion should be recorded.  If 
the lesions have truly coalesced, then the longest diameter should be used for the 
coalesced lesion and assigned to the largest of the coalesced lesions.  The smaller 
of the lesions then should be recorded as 0 mm.  If target lesion(s) coalesces with 
non-target lesion(s), the longest diameter should be used for the coalesced lesions 
and assigned to the largest of the coalesced target lesion(s).  If a target lesion 
merges with a non- target lesion, the non -target lesion should be absent from the 
current visit and all future assessments, and the target lesion should include both 
merged lesions for recording measurements.  New lesions and enlarging non- target 
lesions are measured qualitatively.  
• Splitting lesions:  When a target lesion splits into 2 or more lesions, the largest 
measurable part of the split lesion should be considered to be the previously 
recorded target lesion with measurements provided for the current assessment and followed for future assessments.  The dimensions of the split parts would still be 
target lesions.  Any new lesions that result from  separating should be documented as 
lesions that were generated by separating and not truly “new” lesions.   
Non-Target Lesions  
• Coalescing lesions:  When 2 or more non- target lesions merge, the smaller lesion 
should be recorde as absent for the current and all future assessments, and the larger lesion should be recorded as present for the current assessment and followed for future assessments.   
• Splitting lesions:  When a non- target lesion splits into 2 or more lesions, the split 
parts remain non -target lesions for the duration of the study .  Any new lesions that 
result from separating should be documented as lesions that were generated by separating and not truly new lesions.  
• In contrast to irRECIST, to achieve progression of disease of non -target lesions, 
‘unequivocal progression’ of these lesions must be documented on the basis that  
there must be an overall level of substantial worsening in non -target disease such 
that, even in presence of SD or PR in target disease, the overall tumor burden has 
increased sufficiently to merit discontinuation of therapy.  A modest increase in the 
size or “qualitative worsening” as described for irRECIST assessment would not suffice to achieve ‘unequivocal progression’ status per RECIST v1.1.  
New Lesions  
• A new lesion should be unequivocal.  If a new lesion is equivocal, continued therapy and follow -up evaluation should ensue until it is clear that it represents a new lesion, 
then progression should be declared using the date of the initial scan.  
• Appearance of new malignant lesions on a follow up study in an anatomical location that was not scanned at baseline is considered a new lesion and will indicate disease 
progression.

CONFIDENTIAL    Subjects who have had Complete or Partial Removal/Reduction of the Lesion will be 
Evaluated as Follows:  
• The procedure itself and all post -procedure lesion assessments should always be 
recorded in the CRF.  A completely resected lesion should be assigned a default 
code of 0 mm (for target lesions) or “absent” (for non- target lesions).  A partially 
resected lesion should be assigned its measurement post -procedure (for target 
lesions) or “present” (for non- target lesions).  If the resected lesion contains no 
cancer under pathology evaluation, subsequent tumor assessments post -procedure 
may be used for tumor burden calculations and/or determination of response.  If the resected lesion contains cancer or pathology results are unknown, the recorded 
tumor assessments post -procedure may be used for tumor burden calculations, but 
determination of response will be considered unable to evaluate (UE) for response 
except in the case of PD.  If the new tumor burden post -procedure is lower than the 
nadir before the procedure, then the new nadir will be set to the post procedure tumor burden.  Otherwise, the previous pre- procedure nadir will be retained as the 
nadir.  Subsequent assessments for PD will be determined from the nadir.

Amgen Protocol Number (Talimogene Laherparepvec)  20130232 
EudraCT number 2015-003011-38 
Rationale: 
This protocol i
s being amended to: 
•Add the investigator -assessed RECIST v1.1 secondary tumor response
endpoints of objective response rate (ORR) and progress -free survival (P FS) as
secondary endpoints and remove Complete Response Rate (CRR) per irRECIST
as a secondary endpoint.  Complete Response Rate (CRR) per irRECIST was
removed as a secondary endpoint.
•Replace EQ-5D -3L with EQ -5D-5L to utilize the most recent PRO version
•Revised exclusion criteria regarding re-irradiation
•Replaced modified RECIST v1.1 of 10 maximum lesions with 5 per organ with
standard RECIST v1.1 for screening (5 maximum lesions with 2 per organ) to
align with the use of standard RECIST v1.1 introduced for key secondary
endpoints.
•Added RECIST v1.1 assessment in addition to irRECIST assessment for
response assessment.
•The set of secondary hypotheses to be tested with the Maurer -Bretz procedure
was revised to potentially generate more robust efficacy conclusions.  Testing ofCRR was replaced with ORR.  Testing was added for RECIST v1.1 ORR andPFS.  The total number of potential hypotheses tested as a result increased from
3 to 5.
•The number of events at the OS interim analysis was increased from
approximately 255 to 280 to preserve 70% power in the event of a potential
treatment lag effect.
•Sample size considerations were revised due to the OS interim analysis change
and to discuss the power for the revised secondary hypothesis tests.
•The OS futility criterion at the interim analysis was changed from a conditionalpower < 10% given a true HR of 0.70 to an observed HR > 0.92 considering apotential treatment lag effect.
•An audit-based Blind Independent Central Review (BICR) was added to assess
the consistency  of investigator- and BICR -assessed treatment effects for
RECIST v1.1 ORR and PFS.

Protocol Title:  A Phase 1b/3 Multicenter, Randomized Trial of Talimogene 
Laherparepvec in Combination With Pembrolizumab for the Treatment of Subjects 
With Recurrent or Metastatic Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Head and Neck 
Amgen Protocol Number (Talimogene Laherparepvec)  20130232 
Rationale: 
This protocol is being amended to: 
• Update eligibility criteria triggered by recent safety signal – carotid blowout 
syndrome, and efficacy signal – lack of benefit in primary refractory patients with 
progressive disease within 3 months of curative intent multimodality therapy . 
• Remove progression free survival as a primary endpoint for phase 3 and make it 
a secondary endpoint, along with CRR  
o The decision to forego of PFS as a dual primary endpoint hinged upon a 
few factors which included: the recent outcome of CHECKMATE 141 which led to approval of nivolumab based upon OS and also the final approval or pembrolizumab which is dependent upon OS from KEYNOTE 040.  Considering the fact that OS is a superior outcome measure of a 
treatment over PFS especially in a poor prognosis disease and that PFS 
is not always a surrogate for OS, combined with the precedent set by 
nivolumab approval on OS, we felt that PFS did not have a truly meaningful role in the assessment of the efficacy of TVEC+pembrolizumab in second line head and neck cancer as well as for 
regulatory purposes.   
• Add the use of irRECIST investigator assessment for response assessments and 
remove RECIST 1.1 central review.  
• Update QOL/PRO wording and elevation of QLQ C30-3L to secondary endpoint 
from exploratory . 
• Update statistical methods to justify the endpoint changes and also to introduce OS IA and futility analyses . 
• To add more detail around go no go decision from Phase 1b to 3. 
• Add additional pembrolizumab background information. 
• Add additional talimogene laherparepvec background information. 
• Update IP discontinuation/withholding rules . 
• Update radiographic tumor assessments (sites of disease, spiral CT) . 
• Add additional information for archival tumor tissue. 
• Add additional information for HPV testing. 
• Update safety reporting information. 
• Administrative changes and editorial changes for clarification.

Superseding Amendment 28 June 2016  
Rationale:  
The protocol is amended primarily so that an injectable placebo may be added to 
pembrolizumab in the c ontrol arm and to convert the study from open -label to 
double- blind in phase 3.   This is necessary in order to reduce the bias of having 
intralesional injections in only 1 arm of the study.  
The following key changes have been incorporated into protocol amendment 1 : 
•Updated key contacts
•Changed phase 3 portion of study to be double- blind and added placebo to the
pembrolizumab arm.
•Reordered sections to separate phase 1b and phase 3 in the synopsis,  and general
study procedures  se ctions in order t o more clearly delineat e which  sections are 
specific  to each phase of the study.  Additionally, to reduce the number o f footnotes,

•Updated biopsy requirements in inclusion criteria
•Removed biodistribution and shedding at select sites in phase 3 as we will have
sufficient data from phase 1
•Removed PD -L1 status as a stratification factor
•Removed registry study option
•Updated contraception language for exclusion criterion and also sections related to
pembrolizumab. This is to align with other pembrolizumab protocols.
•Added exclusion criteria for active tuberculosis in order to align with otherpembrolizumab protocols.
•Updated text related to pembrolizumab, rescue medications, dose adjustment,
overdose, and supportive care guidelines to align with other pembrolizumab
protocols.
•Updated pregnancy and lactation reporting language to align with other talimogene
laherparepvec and pembrolizumab protocols.

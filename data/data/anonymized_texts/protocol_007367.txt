ANTICOAGULANT 
DOSAGE AND 
ADMINISTRATION Pre-procedure:  There is a choice of anticoagulation to be administered 
according to the investigator’s standard of care.   
1. If the investigator’s standard of care is to use heparin, unfractionated 
heparin (UFH) will be administered by IV infusion to maintain therapeutic anticoagulation.   
2. If the administration of low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), such as 
enoxaparin (Lovenox®), is the investigator’s standard of care, administer 1mg/kg sub-Q every 12 hours. 
BEC Procedure:  Choose one of the two scenarios below according to the 
investigator’s standard of care:  
1. If heparin was administered pre-procedure or patient received LMWH 
1mg/kg SQ >12 hours prior to the BEC procedure, start BEC procedure with subject on heparin infusion in the IR suite / cath lab. Once r-tPA infusion is started, decrease heparin infusion dose to five (5) to eight (8) units/kg/hr up to a maximum of 1,000 units/hr. 
2. If LMWH was administered ≤ 12 hours pre-procedure, start BEC procedure 
without heparin in the IR suite / cath lab, until patient is 8 hours post last 
dose of LMWH. Then start infusion of UFH at five (5) to eight (8)  units/kg/hr up to a maximum of 1,000 units/hr.   
Post-BEC Procedure:  Heparin infusion at the completion of the BEC 
procedure and during the r-tPA infusion: 
1. Continue heparin administration through the side arm of the sheath at five 
(5) to eight (8) units/kg/hr up to a maximum of 1,000 units/hr.  If bilateral BECs are in place, the heparin infusi ons must be administered into each 
sheath.  Administer half (or approxi mately half) the dose prescribed by the 
investigator into the side arm of each  sheath to equal the prescribed dose. 
2. If subject has not reached 8 hours post last dose of LMWH in the IR suite 
/ cath lab, then in the ICU start dose of UFH at five (5) to eight (8)  
units/kg/hr up to a maximum of 1,000 units/hr. 
Post r-tPA Infusion:  Once r-tPA infusion is complete, increase UFH dose to 
target aPTT within therapeutic range (aPTT suggested 60-80 sec). Replace r-
tPA infusion with standard heparinized saline through the basket infusion line 
connector of the BEC(s) at 30cc/hour to  maintain patency until removal.  
Sheath Removal: Stop UFH for at least one (1) hour prior to sheath removal, 
unless the operator believes that the UFH, in the best interest of the patient, 
should not be stopped prior to and during sheath removal.  Remove sheaths according to standard of care. 
Anticoagulation Post-Sheath Removal: Re-start anticoagulation within one 
(1) hour post sheath removal with LM WH 1mg/kg SQ q 12 hours or UFH at 
therapeutic doses for 24 hours post sheath removal.  After 24 hours post sheath 
removal, physicians can start therapeu tic anticoagulation according to their 
standard of care. If physicians choose to use DOACs then patients should be 
properly loaded according to the current guidelines.

Refined Modified 
Miller Score (RMMS) Like the Modified Miller (MM) score , the Refined Modified Miller score 
(RMMS) regards each lung as having 10 segmental arteries, and the degree 
of obstruction of the segmental pulmona ry arteries is measured using an 
ordinal scale. In contrast to the MM, however, the RM score allows for a ﬁner 
distinction of partial obstruction in sev en major arteries; the main pulmonary 
artery, left and right pulmonary artery, left and right interlobar arteries, left 
and right basal trunks. Partial obstruction is classi ﬁed into three categories 
based upon cross-sectional diameter reduction: 0.5 for 1–33%, 1.0 for 34–
66%, and 1.5 for 67–99% obstruction. As in the MM scoring system, the weighted score of the major supplying ar tery is compared with the sum of its 
tributaries, and the larger number is recorded. For example, if thrombus 
obstructed the lumen of a basal trunk v essel by 50% (score =1.0 x 7), but its 
four segmental tributaries were fully occluded (score = 2.0 x 4), the higher value of 8 would be recorded as th e RMM score. A cumulative score is 
calculated by summing the scores for all arteries. Similar to the MM score, 
the RMM score can range from 0 to 20 per lung, for a maximum of 40 bilaterally.

TIA Transient ischemic attack 
Troponin Cardiac troponins are the most sensitiv e and the most specific biochemical 
markers showing myocardial injury. El evated troponin can also be seen in 
acute pericarditis, myocarditis, acute PE, severe cardiac failure, sepsis and 
acute renal failure as well as in myocardial infarction.  In acute PE, the 
mechanic load of the right ventricle is increased because of the increased 
pulmonary vascular resistance following pulmonary artery obstruction. That 
can lead to acute right ventricular dilatation. The dilatation and hypokinesia 
of the right ventricle may cause severe myocardial ischemia and increase the 
troponin levels. Increased serum Troponin levels support the diagnosis of 
severe PE.

This protocol is confidential prop erty of Thrombolex, Inc and in no wa y should be distributed all or in 
part without written permission from Thrombolex, Inc. 4.0 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE 
4.1 Clinical Problem   
Acute venous thromboembolism (VTE) includes deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and acute 
pulmonary embolism (PE). PE occurs when a deep  vein thrombus breaks loose and embolizes 
to the pulmonary artery. Pulmonary embolism is the third leading cause of cardiovascular death 
after myocardial infarction and stroke and is a major global health problem.1,2    
 
Raskob et al (2014) conducted a literature search a nd review and found that there is a strong and 
consistent association between an increase in incidence of VTE and increasing age. They found 
the annual incidence increased from between 2 and 7 per 1,000 populati on for those 79 and 
younger to between 3 and 12 per 1,000 population for those aged 80 and older.  This finding has 
major implications for the treatment of the elderly in the US healthcare system.2 It is important 
to note that 60 percent of the VTE events are associated with hospitalization.3 The number of 
deaths from VTE in the USA has previously been reported to be approximately 300,000 
annually.3,4 Clinically, study subjects may present with DVT or PE, or both.  With many of the 
known risk factors, advanced age, immobility, su rgery, obesity, increasing in our society, this 
number only continues to grow.  Because there is  no national surveillance program for VTE, the 
precise number with VTE of all types is unknown.5,6 
 
Patients who present with PE may be classified into  low risk, intermediate risk (submassive) or 
high risk (massive) PE. Both massive and submassive PE cause right ventricular (RV) 
dysfunction, while massive PE in addition causes systemic hypotension.  Typical diagnostic 
studies include contrast enhanced computer ized tomography (CT) to diagnose the PE, 
echocardiography to assess right and left ventricu lar function, and cardiac biomarkers, such as 
troponin I, and BNP to assess the degree of myocardial ischemia/strain associated with the PE.  
Patients categorized as having a low-risk PE do not have evidence of hemodynamic compromise 
or RV dysfunction.  Low risk PE patients are not included in this study for obvious reasons.7 
4.2 Current Treatment Options   
Anticoagulant therapies are admini stered to symptomatic patients while their workups are being 
completed for a definitive diagnosis of massive or  submassive PE.  For the treatment of massive 
and submassive PE, both systemic administra tion and catheter-directed administration of 
thrombolytic therapies have been utilized.8-10 However, systemic administration of 
thrombolytics carries a prohibitively high risk of bleeding: Up to 7% intracranial bleeds and up 
to 20% major bleeding rates; he nce the attraction of delivering thrombolytics in much lower 
dosage directly into the clot to treat this potentially life-threatening condition.11   
Devices for percutaneous treatment of patients in whom systemic thrombolytic therapy is 
absolutely contraindicated have been developed and utilized.   The percutaneous devices include 
manual thrombus fragmentation using a balloon di latation catheter or a pigtail (off-the shelf 
technologies). More recently, catheters specifica lly created for thrombus fragmentation that 
produce greater fragmentation of the clot comp ared to off-the-shelf technologies mentioned

This protocol is confidential prop erty of Thrombolex, Inc and in no wa y should be distributed all or in

thrombus burden; rheolytic thrombectomy where a salin e jet is directed into the clot and the clot 
and saline are aspirated, have been introduced.7-10,12-14  However, there are also hazards 
associated with rapid clot fragmentation includ ing hemodynamic collapse   due to the distal 
embolization of thrombus and release of vasoactive substances.     
Over the past several years a device received 510(k) clear ance for its ultrasound-facilitated, 
catheter directed low-dose fibrinolysis using r-t PA (EKOS, Bothell WA). With this technology, 
the EKOS ultrasound device was used to deliver t-PA in patients with massive and submassive 
PE at 1mg/hour over 24 hours (unilateral PE), and 2mg/hr over 12 hours (bilateral PE).15  
More recently, studies have reported that th e ultrasound component of the EKOS device does 
not contribute to the effectiveness of the tr eatment of submassive and massive pulmonary 
embolism.  Kuo et al (2015) found in a real-wor ld registry, for CDT that incorporated USAT, 
there was no advantage in patients treated with US AT vs standard CDT. These data suggest that 
CDT may be performed effectively without  the added cost associated with USAT.16 In a 
subgroup analysis comparing patients treated with EKOS to those treated with standard infusion 
catheters, Bloomer et al (2017) reported a st udy for the Safety of CDT for massive and 
submassive PE: Results of a multi-center registry and Meta-analysis. Bloomer et al found in a 
subgroup analysis comparing patients treated with EKOS to those treated with standard infusion 
catheters, that there were similar PA pressure changes after CDT and similar complication rates. 
CDT is associated with a low major complication rate.17  
Tafur et al (2016) conducted a Systematic Revi ew and Meta-Analysis of Modern Literature. 
They concluded from their study current clinical evidence does not show that USAT is superior 
to other CDT methods.18   
Overall, CDT decreased PASP, decreased RV to LV diameter ratio, and reduced the Modified 
Miller Index scores.  The goal of CDT is to substantially reduce thrombus burden, as assessed 
by the Modified Miller Index on CTA, which rema ins high with currently available catheters, 
with or without USAT.   
While it is critical to reduce RV/LV ratio, it is of great importance to both short-term and long-
term patient outcomes to decrease the thrombus burden as much as is feasible.  Even a small 
reduction in the clot burden can translate in to a marked improvement in RV function and 
improve acute survival. However, much more e ffective reduction in the residual clot burden is 
required to reduce the long-term complicati ons of PE, including disabling post-PE syndrome 
and chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH).7   
4.3 Study Rationale 
While the medical community con tinues to focus on prevention of VTE, half of all VTE patients 
have unprovoked VTE. Therefore, the treatme nt options for patients who present with DVT 
and/or acute PE must continue to evolve to increase efficacy, decrease side effects, limit long-
term complications, and provide an improved qua lity of life for these patients. This study is 
focused on the treatment of patients with acute  submassive PE with an interventional device 
designed to increase the exposure of the th rombus burden to endoge nous and exogenous

burden.   
 
The Bashir™ Endovascular Catheter has been designe d to administer therapeutic agents in the 
peripheral vasculature.  Because of the unique desi gn of the catheter, with its six expandable 
infusion limbs, the Bashir™ Endovascular Catheter  has the ability to: 1. Create a much larger 
central channel for blood flow, thereby utilizing the body’s own endogenous fibrinolytic agents 
to lyse the clot, and 2. Greatly enhance the radial dispersion of a catheter-administered 
thrombolytic agent throughout the thrombus.  E xpansion of the multiple arms of the basket in 
the infusion catheter causes fissu ring of the clot. The net result is that a greater surface area of 
clot is exposed to both endoge nous and exogenously administ ered lytic agents, thereby 
promoting clot dissolution. 
 
This study will utilize the Bashir™ Endovascular Ca theter and the Bashir Endovascular Catheter 
with a short basket (Bashir™ S-B endovascular catheter) to administer catheter directed 
thrombolysis in patients with submassive PE who have consented and meet all eligibility 
criteria.  The Bashir™ and Bashir™ S-B e ndovascular catheters represent a new methodology 
for localized catheter-based delivery of thrombolyti cs. The thrombolytic to be used in this study 
is r-tPA (Genentech Corporation, South San Francisco, USA).19 The dosing of the thrombolytic 
in the past has been much gr eater than what is proposed in this study.  The SEATTLE II study 
administered a total of 24 mg of r-tPA over 12 hours for bilateral PE and 24mg over 24 hours 
for unilateral PE.  The incidence of major bleeding in the SEATTLE II study was 10 percent.20  
The design of the Bashir Endovascular Catheter  with the multiple infusion limbs creating a 
basket-like formation when expanded, provides an immediate channel for blood flow through 
the thrombus and a greater surface area in the thrombus for the endogenous and exogenous 
thrombolytics to take effect, as described above.  
 
Because of the rationale stated previously, a re duced dose of thrombolytic can be administered 
over a reduced period of time due to an increas ed exposure of the clot to endogenous and 
exogenous thrombolytics for clot dissolution.  The OPTALYSE study, using the EKOS catheter, 
was conducted to assess the outcomes with lower dos e r-tPA administration for the treatment of 
acute submassive PE. Four groups were administ ered lower doses of r-tPA over a shorter period 
of time.  While each group showed a statisti cally significant reduction in RV/LV ratio at 48 
hours post-procedure, the reduction in residual clot burden was noticeably lower (6%) in patients 
treated with the smallest dose of  r- tPA for the shortest time period (4/8 mg r-tPA over 2 hours) 
compared to those treated with the highest dose for the longest duration (26% reduction in clot 
burden; 12/24 mg r-tPA over 6 hours). This illustrates the discordance between reduction in 
RV/LV diameter ratio and reduction in clot burden, as well as a dose response relationship. 
between the dose of r-tPA administered and the reduction in clot burden.30 It is much easier to 
achieve the former than the latter with low doses of r-tPA for shorter periods of time. There is 
clearly also a lot of room for improvement if 74% of the clot burden still remains after the 
highest dose of infusion in the OPTALYSE study.21

This protocol is confidential prop erty of Thrombolex, Inc and in no wa y should be distributed all or in 
part without written permission from Thrombolex, Inc. We hypothesize that the dose of r-tPA may be  reduced using the Bashir™ Endovascular 
Catheter from what was administered in the SEATTLE II study, i.e. 24mg over 12 hours 
(bilateral PE) or 24 hours (unilateral PE), becau se of its unique features described previously, 
as well as our experience in the First- in-Man study just completed with the BEC in patient with 
acute submassive pulmonary embolism (see below).20 We therefore propose to utilize the 
following regimen: r-tPA 2mg in 20cc administered,  1.0mg in two 10cc increments  into the 
PA for a total of 2 pulse sprays into the infusi on basket.  This will be done for each PA if the 
subject has bilateral pulmonary embolisms. The pul se sprays will be followed by a 5mg infusion 
at 1.00mg/hr until complete for unilateral PE, a nd 5mg infusion into each pulmonary artery for 
bilateral PE, at 1.0mg/hr until complete.  This is  a total of 10.0mg over approximately five hours 
(pulse spray 1.0mg x 2 sprays = 2mg plus infusi on at 1.0mg/hr x 5 hours = 7mg for unilateral 
PE). For bilateral PE, we propose to administer  the same pulse spray and same infusion dose 
into each PA for a total of 14mg administered.  This is a substantially lower dose and a shorter 
duration of treatment compared to SEATTLE II for the treatment of PE in a similar patient 
cohort.   
4.4 First-in-Man Study Results 
The first-in-man study has been completed.  Nine  subjects were enrolled, treated, and followed 
through 30-day follow-up.  Patients received 2 X 1mg pulse sprays of r-tPA into each affected 
pulmonary artery followed by a total of 10mg r-t PA over 8 hours. The total dose of r-tPA for 
unilateral PE was thus 12mg and for bilateral PE 14mg.  Through 30-day follow-up there were 
no deaths, BEC or r-tPA related major bleeding, or device related adverse events. After 48 hours 
the RV/LV ratio decreased from 1.52  0.26 to 0.97  0.06 (p = .0009: 95% CI = 0.33 to 0.82: 
36.7% reduction) as assessed by an independent co re lab (Medical Metrics, Houston, TX). 
Thrombus burden measured by Modified Miller Index as assessed by the independent core lab 
(Medical Metrics, Houston, TX) decreased from 25.4  5.3 to 16.0  4.0 (p = .0005: 95% CI = 
5.5 to 13.4: 37.1% reduction). BEC CDT appears safe, preliminary evidence shows that this 
platform technology leads to significant reducti on in RV/LV ratio and thrombus burden.  The 
study protocol permitted to enroll up to ten (10)  subjects.  The sponsor stopped enrollment on 
December 3, 2019 due to the consistent results shown across the sites after nine (9) subjects 
were enrolled. 
5.0 INVESTIGATIONAL DEVICE 
The Bashir™ Endovascular Catheter (BEC) and the BEC Short Basket (S-B) are devices intended for 
the localized infusion of therapeu tic agents into the pulmonary arte ry and peripheral vasculature. The 
distal infusion segment of the device contains an e xpandable radial array of conduits with a total of 48 
laser drilled orifices used for the delivery of the ther apeutic agents at multiple cross-sectional points of 
the target vessel location. The infusion segment ca n be expanded and collapsed  by the actuator (slider) 
located on the handle at the proximal end of the devi ce. The infusion line connector is also located on 
the handle.22 The difference between the BEC and the BEC S-B is solely in the length of the basket. In 
its unexpanded state, the basket of the BEC 12.5c m long and the BEC S-B basket is 10cm long. The 
choice of device used will be at the physician’s di scretion based on the patient’s anatomy.

part without written permission from Thrombolex, Inc. 6.4.2 COVID-19 Impact Assessment Form - Enrollment  
A COVID-19 Impact Assessment Form will be completed to assess if study 
investigators and other site personnel are unable to be on site to manage 
enrollment, and having subjects at the ins titution places them at risk, and if there 
is a known risk that follow up may not occur as planned.  This form shall be 
submitted to the CRO as soon as possible.  The CRO will review the Impact 
Assessment Form with Thrombolex Inc.  and communicate an appropriate plan 
according to the site’s level of operation.  Enrollment will be suspended if a site 
cannot enroll in accordance with the study protocol. All actions regarding 
suspension and activation will be documen ted. The site IRB will be sent all 
related communications.  
The implementation of alternative pro cesses should be consistent with the 
protocol to the extent possible, and s ponsors and clinical investigators should 
document the reason for any contingenc y measures implemented. Sponsors and 
clinical investigators should document how restrictions related to COVID-19 
led to the changes in study conduct and duration of those changes and indicate 
which trial participants were impacted and how those trial participants were 
impacted.  
6.4.3 Follow-up 
The follow-up for each subject will be completed at 30-days post-hospital 
discharge.  
6.4.4 COVID-19 Impact Assessment Form - Follow-Up Visits 
The COVID-19 Impact Assessment Form identifies aspects of the follow-up 
visits that can be completed and how (i.e. via telephone, or video conference). 
The CRO will review the Impact Assessme nt Form with Thrombolex, Inc. and 
generate site specific follow-up protocols to be implemented. This will ensure 
that alternate follow-up visit plans are c onsistent for the site and in accordance 
with the COVID-19 Impact Assessment. The COVID-19 Impact Assessment 
Form, if completed by site(s) due to necessary changes in study conduct, the 
changes will be in effect until clinical research operations are restored.   
All actions related to COVID-19 will be  documented. If a follow-up visit under 
the COVID-19 does not meet protocol re quirements, the visit will be reported 
as a protocol deviation and tracking of  visits where protocol requirements 
cannot be met conducted under COVID-19 will be documented.

7.0 METHODOLOGY 
7.1 Pre-Procedure Testing Within 48 Hours Pre-Procedure 
7.1.1 Laboratory Tests 
1. CMP, CBC, Cardiac Biomarkers Troponin and BNP  – These tests will 
be drawn within 48 hours pre-procedure. 
2. aPTT  – Drawn within 48 hours pre-procedure. If the investigator’s 
standard of care is to use hepari n, unfractionated heparin will be 
administered, and aPTT is to be drawn prior to the BEC procedure.   
3.  International Normalized Ratio (INR)  – INR will be drawn within 48 
hours pre-procedure for patients who are on warfarin (Coumadin®) and 
must be ≤ 1.5 to be eligible for enrollment.  Patients who are on warfarin 
who have consented for the study and have an INR ≤ 1.5, warfarin will be 
discontinued during the heparin in fusion and the r-tPA infusion and 
restarted prior to hospital discharge.  
7.1.2 Imaging 
1. Contrast Enhanced CT of Chest (CTA)  – A chest CTA will be performed 
within 48 hours pre-procedure.  Th e CTA is used to determine the pre-
procedure Refined Miller Score by core lab analysis.  The CTA will be used 
by the study site to determine eligib ility into the study ensuring the RV/LV 
diameter ratio is ≥ 0.9 by CTA.  CTA will be sent to the core lab for 
analysis. 25 
 
2. Lower Extremity Venous DUS  – A duplex ultrasound is required within 
48 hours pre-procedure to verify pa tency of the common femoral vein 
(CFV) for femoral access.  The right CF V or the left CFV may be used for 
access, whichever is patent.  If both of the CFVs are not patent, an internal 
jugular (IJ) vein may be used for access.  IJ may also be used if that is the 
operator’s preference.

1. Physical Examination  – The physician will perform a physical exam 
within 48 hours prior to the procedure to ensure the subject meets eligibility 
criteria.  
 
2. RV/LV Diameter Ratio  – The RV/LV ratio will be measured within 48 
hours pre-procedure by CTA to ensure  the subject meets the eligibility 
criteria of an axial RV/LV ratio ≥ 0.9, as determined by the investigative 
site.  The independent core lab pr otocol will be followed for data 
acquisition.  The CTA will be sent to the core lab for analyses.  
 
3. 12-Lead Electrocardiogram (ECG)  – A 12-lead ECG will be performed 
prior to the procedure.  
7.1.4 Anticoagulation 
Pre-procedure:  There is a choice of anticoagulation to be administered 
according to the investigator’s standard of care.  
1. If the investigator’s standard of care is to use heparin, unfractionated 
heparin (UFH) will be administered by IV infusion to main tain therapeutic 
anticoagulation.  
2. If the administration of LMWH, such as enoxaparin (Lovenox®), is the 
investigator’s standard of care, administer 1mg/kg sub-Q every 12 hours.  
BEC Procedure:  Choose one of the two scenar ios below according to the 
investigator’s standard of care:  
1. If heparin was administered pre-procedure or patient received LMWH 
1mg/kg SQ >12 hours prior to the BEC procedure, start BEC procedure with subject on heparin infusion in the IR suite / cath lab.  Once r-tPA 
infusion is started, decrease dose of heparin to five (5) to eight (8) 
units/kg/hr up to a maximum of 1,000 units/hr. ACTs may be checked if 
standard of care. 
2. If LMWH was administered pre-procedure, start BEC procedure without 
heparin in the IR suite / cath lab, un til patient is 8 hours post last dose of 
LMWH.  Then start dose of UFH at five (5) to eight (8) units/kg/hr up to a 
maximum of 1,000 units/hr. ACTs may be checked if standard of care. 
 
Post-BEC Procedure:  Heparin infusion at the completion of the BEC 
procedure and during the r-tPA infusion: 
1. Continue heparin administration through the side arm of the sheath at five 
(5) to eight (8) units/kg/hr up to a maximum of 1,000 units/hr.  If bilateral 
BECs are in place, then one-half of the dose of the heparin infusion must 
be administered into each sheath for a total prescribed dose.  Administer 
half (or approximately half) the dose pr escribed by the investigator into the 
side arm of each sheath to equal the prescribed dose.

This protocol is confidential prop erty of Thrombolex, Inc and in no wa y should be distributed all or in 
part without written permission from Thrombolex, Inc. 2. If subject has not reached 8hrs post last dose of LMWH in the IR suite / 
cath lab, then in the ICU start dose of UFH at five (5) to eight (8) units/kg/hr 
up to a maximum of 1,000 units/hr. 
 
Post r-tPA Infusion:  Once r-tPA infusion is complete, increase UFH dose to 
keep aPTT within therapeutic range (aPTT suggested 60-80 sec).  Replace r-
tPA infusion with standard heparinized saline at 30cc/hr on an infusion pump 
through the basket infusion line connector of the BEC(s) to maintain patency 
until removal of the BEC(s).   
 
Sheath Removal: Stop UFH for at least one (1) hour prior to sheath removal, 
unless the operator believes that the UFH, in the best interest of the patient, 
should not be stopped prior to and duri ng sheath removal.  Remove sheaths 
according to standard of care. 
Anticoagulation Post-Sheath Removal: Re-start anticoagulation within one 
(1) hour post sheath removal with LMWH 1mg/kg SQ q12hrs or UFH at 
therapeutic doses for 24hrs post sheath removal.  After 24hrs post sheath 
removal, physicians can start therapeu tic anticoagulation according to their 
standard of care.  If phys icians choose to use DOACs then patients should be 
properly loaded according to the current guidelines.  
7.1.5 Data Collection 
The following data will be collected and documented in the CRF in addition to 
the required pre-procedure testing. 
1. Informed Consent  – Required for all study subjects prior to any testing 
that is not the standard of care. Plea se note that the screen failure rate is 
unknown for this study.  Patients may be consented until up to 125 subjects 
have been enrolled and treated per protocol. Therefore, more subjects will 
be consented than are treated in order to reach the minimum of 100 subjects included in the analysis.  The subjects enrolled and treated per site will not 
exceed 20 subjects.  
2. Demographics and Medical History  – Recorded once Informed Consent 
has been obtained.  
3. Eligibility Criteria  – All inclusion criteria must be met, and all exclusion 
criteria must not be met to enroll in this study.  
4. Medications  – All antiplatelet, anticoagulant, cardiac meds, and NSAIDs 
will be recorded within 48 hours pre-procedure, at baseline.  
5. Refined Modified Miller Score (RMMS) – Refined Modified Miller 
Score (RMMS) will be calculated by the core lab at baseline. The CTA will 
be sent to the core lab for RMI analysis.

3. Place 7F sheath(s) in the RCFV or access point  of choice (CFV or IJ).  CFV or IJ 
access is operator’s choice. 
9.2 Choose one of the two anticoagulation options below according to the investigator’s 
standard of care:  
1. If heparin was administered pre-proce dure or patient received LMWH >12 hours 
prior to the BEC procedure, start BEC proce dure in the IR suite / cath lab while on 
heparin. Once r-tPA infusion is started, decr ease dose of heparin to five (5) to eight 
(8) units/kg/hr up to a maximum of 1,000 units/hr.  
2. If LMWH was administered ≤ 12 pre-procedure, start BEC procedure without 
heparin in the IR suite / cath lab, until patient is eight (8) hours post last dose of 
LMWH. Then start dose of UFH at five (5) to eight (8) units/kg/hr up to a maximum 
of 1,000 units/hr.  ACTs may be checked if standard of care.   
9.3 Summary of Procedure Steps

9.4 Bashir Endovascular Catheter Use – Procedure Steps 
1. Prepare all r-tPA solutions and IV infusion mixtures in Section 8.3  prior to 
opening the Bashir™ Endovascular Catheter (BECs).  The Bashir™ S-B 
Endovascular Catheter may be preferred fo r smaller patients or for treatment of 
thrombus in the left pulmonary.   
2. Prepare the relevant BEC(s) for use: 
a. Ensure that the infusion basket of th e BEC can be expanded and collapsed by 
moving the actuator on the handle backward and forward while depressing the 
white button.  
b. With the basket expanded, flush the basket infusion port with standard flush 
solution. Observe for flush solution ex iting the infusion holes of the basket.  
Collapse the basket. 
c. Flush the wire lumen of the BEC observing that flush solution exits the tip of 
the catheter.   
3. Using a .018in x 300cm length steel core  non-hydrophilic guidewire, introduce the 
wire into the central lumen of the long sheath. 
4. Backload the BEC onto the 0.018in guidewire and advance towards the long sheath. 
DO NOT insert the BEC into the sheath.   
5. Attach a three-way stopcock to the infusion basket port of the BEC. 
6. Commence r-tPA infusion via the stopcock on the basket infusion line connector 
using an infusion pump. Start the infu sion through the BEC PRIOR TO inserting 
the catheter into the sheath. This is to maintain patency durin g catheter insertion, 
advancement, and positioning in the patient.

This protocol is confidential prop erty of Thrombolex, Inc and in no wa y should be distributed all or in 
part without written permission from Thrombolex, Inc. 7. Advance the BEC into the target PA and retract the sheath to expose the basket 
segment.    
8. Do NOT aspirate back from the basket infusion line connect or to back bleed.  Only 
maintain forward flow by infusing the r-t PA at the prescribed rate 100cc/hr for 
unilateral PE and bilateral PE, as stated in Table 2.  
9. Keeping the wire in the central wire lume n expand the infusion basket of the BEC. 
9.5 Pulse Spray of r-tPA for Unilateral and Bilateral PE 
a. Unilateral PE :  With the catheter in the target PA , and after verifying that the basket 
portion of the catheter has exited the sheath under fluoroscopy, and with the 
guidewire in place, expand the basket of the catheter to the desired diameter making sure that the infusion limbs are expanded to less than the diameter of the vessel wall. 
b. Turn stopcock off to the infusion and administer 10ml (1.0mg r-tPA in 10ml) of 
pulse spray, from the 1
st syringe of two syringes, into the thrombus at a steady rate 
over 10-15 seconds.  
c. Under fluoroscopy, with the guidewire in place, collapse the basket and re-expand 
the basket. 
d. Repeat this with the second 10cc syringe (1.0mg r-tPA in 10ml) over 10-15 seconds. 
e. As soon as the pulse sprays are administered, turn the stopcock open to the r-tPA 
infusion to restart the r-tPA via the infusion port of the BEC. 
Please note: Even if the clot appears to be primarily unilateral, the default should be 
to use a second BEC in the contralateral pu lmonary artery if there is any substantial 
clot on the contralateral side.   
f. Bilateral PE : Repeat, using a second BEC, steps a-e for bilateral PE. 
g. Once pulse sprays are complete, the basket(s) should remain expanded. 
h. Remove the guidewire(s), attach a 3-way stopcock and connect fluid or cap off the 
line. (See specifics at 9.9.3).  
Please note that the BEC is to be placed in the optimal location to treat the PE.  It is 
NOT to be used to selectively cannulate multiple branches of the pulmonary 
vasculature in multiple locations  to administer the r-tPA.  
9.6 r-tPA Infusion – Prior to Departing the IR Suite / Cath Lab 
1. For unilateral PE: The total r-tPA infusion is 5mg at 1.0mg/hr. Using an IV pump 
at 100cc/hr, infuse the 500cc of 0.9% NaCl with the 5mg r-tPA at 1.0mg/hr until 
infusion is complete (approximately 5 hours). 
2. For bilateral PE:  The r-tPA infusion is 5mg at 1.0mg/hr into each BEC. Using two 
(2) IV pumps at 100cc/hr, infuse the 500cc of 0.9% NaCl x 2 simultaneously for 
1.0mg/hr into each PE until complete (approximately 5 hours), for a total infusion 
dose of 10mg.

This protocol is confidential prop erty of Thrombolex, Inc and in no wa y should be distributed all or in 
part without written permission from Thrombolex, Inc. 9.7 Anticoagulation Post-BEC Procedure 
Heparin infusion at the completion of the BEC procedure and during the r-tPA infusion 
1. Continue heparin administration through the side arm of the sheath at five (5) to 
eight (8) units/kg/hr up to a maximum of 1,000 units/hr.  If bilateral BECs are in 
place, the heparin infusions must be administ ered into each sheath.  Administer half 
(or approximately half) the dose prescribed by the investigator into the side arm of 
each sheath to equal the prescribed dose. 
2. If subject has not reached 8hrs post last does of LMWH in the IR suite / cath lab, 
then in the ICU start dose of UFH to five (5) to eight (8) units/kg/hr up to a 
maximum of 1,000 units/hr. 
9.8 Maintaining Patency Through the Central Lumen of the BEC(s) During Transport 
to ICU 
To maintain patency of the central lumen (guidewire lumen) of the BEC(s) during 
transport to the ICU, follow hospital standard  protocol during transport to ICU, unless 
the BEC central lumen is not going to be u sed for PA pressure monitoring in the ICU 
and it is capped off.  
9.9 Preparation in IR Suite / Cath Lab for Transfer to ICU 
1. Suture sheaths in place. 
2. Secure r-tPA and heparin drips to maintain infusions in the ICU. 
3. The BEC central lumen (guidewire lumen) may be used to monitor PA pressures in 
the ICU. 
a. Option #1: Connect fluid to central lumen (guidewire lumen) at hospital 
standard of care dose and rate (e.g. heparinized saline at 500 units/500cc .9% NaCl or 100 units/500cc .9% NaCl or .45% NaCl or other standard of care 
saline concentration, or normal saline wi thout heparin) using pressure tubing to 
the stopcock  to maintain patency until removal of the BEC(s).  Using this set-
up provides the option of monitoring th e PA pressures in the ICU during the r-
tPA infusion.   
b. Option #2:    If the central lumen of the BEC(s) is/are not going to be used for 
monitoring pressure in the ICU, the centr al lumen may be capped off prior to 
leaving the IR Suite / Cath Lab. 
4. Securing the device(s):   
a. For CFV Access: tape device to thi gh.  Then follow step “5” below. 
b. For Right IJ Access: Cover the catheter with a sterile sleeve (such as the sleeve 
that comes with a Swan-Ganz catheter) tape  device to left pectoral area with the 
shaft of the catheter placed posterior to the neck.  Then follo w step “5” below. 
Do the opposite for Left IJ access. 
5. Place a strong adhesive dressing, such as Tegaderm™ (3M™, St Paul, MN) or 
equivalent tape over the handle and the actua tor (slider) to make sure the handle and 
actuator (slider) are secure and cannot be moved.

experienced in the care of patients treated for pulmonary embolisms. 
10.1 r-tPA Infusion – Intensive Care Unit 
1. r-tPA Infusion:  Maintain the r-tPA Infusion thr ough the infusion line on the side 
of the handle of the BEC in the ICU for a pproximately five (5) hours from start of 
the infusion in the IR suite / cath lab.  Th e infusion should run at the rate prescribed 
in this protocol until the infusion is complete. See section 8.3  
10.2 Post-r-tPA Infusion: 
1. Maintain BEC Infusion Basket Patency: Once the  r-tPA infusion is complete, 
maintain patency through the infusion basket of the BEC(s) by replacing r-tPA 
infusion with heparinized saline (per hospital standard of care e.g. 500 units/500cc 
.9% NaCl or  100 units/500cc .9% NaCl or other standard of care heparinized concentration) using an infusion pump, at 30cc/hr, until the BEC(s) is / are 
removed.  Please note this solution must be heparinized. 
2. Anticoagulation Post-r-tPA infusion:  At the completion of r-tPA infusion, 
increase heparin dose to ther apeutic doses with target aPTT in therapeutic range 
(suggested 60-80sec).  
3. Physical Exam:  A physical exam is required to be performed as soon as possible 
after the completion of the r-tPA infusion.  
10.3 The Completion of r-tPA Infusion in the ICU  
1. The BEC catheter(s) will be removed as soon as possible at the end of infusion only 
by an operator trained and approved to place and remove the study device. Collapse 
the basket(s) of the BEC(s).  
2. Remove the BEC by retracting the catheter(s) carefully into the sheath(s) and then 
removing them from the body. Do not remove the sheath(s) at this time. 
3. Please note: If pressurized tubing set-up was used to monitor the pressure through 
the central lumen of a BEC in the ICU, aseptically remove the tubing from the port 
at the back of the BEC and set aside for using for step 5a below.   
4. Back bleed the sheath(s) and flush with heparinized saline. 
5. Attach pressure tubing to the side arm of  the sheath(s) and record the following: 
a. Final hemodynamic parameters (PAS, PAD,  PA Mean) – record from each PA 
if bilateral PE with bilateral sheaths in place. 
b. S
pO2 – Pulse oximetry oxygen saturation.  
c. SvO2 – Mixed venous oxygen saturation. 
d. CO –  Calculate using the Modified Fick formula.

6. After BEC removal, the long sheath may be  exchanged for a s hort sheath once the 
hemodynamic parameters have been recorded if the sheaths are not removed at the 
completion of the r-tPA infusion (after the effects of the r-tPA have worn off).  
10.4 Sheath Removal 
1. Sheath removal:  Stop UFH for at least one (1) hour prior to sheath removal, unless 
the operator believes that the UFH, in the b est interest of the patient, should not be 
stopped prior to and during sheath removal.  Remove sheaths according to standard 
of care. 
2. Anticoagulation Post-Sheath Removal: Re-start anticoagula tion within one (1) 
hour post sheath removal with LMWH 1mg/kg SQ q12hrs or UFH at therapeutic 
doses for 24 hours post sheath removal. After 24 hours post sheath removal, 
physicians can start therapeutic anticoagula tion according to their standard of care. 
If physicians choose to use DOACs then  patients should be properly loaded 
according to the current guidelines.

17.0 ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING 
17.1 Serious Adverse Events   
An adverse event is any undesirable experi ence associated with the use of a medical 
product in a patient. The event is serious and will be collected when the patient outcome 
is: 
1. Death 
2. Life-threatening - Report if suspected that th e patient was at substantial risk of dying 
at the time of the adverse event or use or continued use of the device or other 
medical product might have resulted in the death of the patient. 
3. Hospitalization (initial or prolonged) - Report if admission to the hospital or 
prolongation of hospitalization was a result of the adverse event. 
Emergency room visits that do not resu lt in admission to the hospital should be 
evaluated for one of the other serious outcomes (e.g., life-threatening; required 
intervention to prevent permanent impairme nt or damage; other serious medically 
important event).

part without written permission from Thrombolex, Inc. 4. Disability or Permanent Damage - Report if the adverse event resulted in a 
substantial disruption of a person's ability to conduct normal life functions, i.e., the 
adverse event resulted in a significant, pers istent or permanent change, impairment, 
damage or disruption in the patient's body function/structure, physical activities 
and/or quality of life. 
5. Congenital Anomaly/Birth Defect - Report if  you suspect that exposure to a medical 
product prior to conception or during pre gnancy may have resu lted in an adverse 
outcome in the child. 
6. Required Intervention to Prevent Permanen t Impairment or Damage (Devices) - 
Report if you believe that medical or surgical intervention was necessary to 
preclude permanent impairment of a body function, or prevent permanent damage 
to a body structure, either  situation suspected to be due to the use of a medical 
product. 
7. Other Serious (Important Medical Events) - Report when the event does not fit the 
other outcomes, but the event may jeopard ize the patient and may require medical 
or surgical intervention (treatment) to pr event one of the other outcomes. Examples 
include allergic bronchospasm (a seri ous problem with breathing) requiring 
treatment in an emergency room, serious  blood dyscrasias (blood disorders) or 
seizures/convulsions that do not result in hospitalization. The development of drug 
dependence or drug abuse would also be examples of important medical events. 
17.2 Unanticipated Adverse Device Effect  
Unanticipated adverse device effect is any serious adverse effect on health or safety, 
any life-threatening problem or death caused by, or associated with a device, if that 
effect, problem, or death was not previously identified in nature, severity, or degree of 
incidence in the application; or any othe r unanticipated serious problem associated 
with a device that relates to the rights, safety, or welfare of subjects.   
17.3 Adverse Event Documentation 
All adverse events (AEs) including those categorized as anticipated, life threatening, 
serious, unexpected, and suspected are to be reported on the case report form.

Relatedness 
Term Relatedness Definition 
Related There is clear evidence to suggest a causal relationship, and other possible 
contributing factors can be ruled out. The clinical event, including an abnormal laboratory test result, occurs  in a plausible time relationship to 
drug administration or use of devi ce and cannot be explained by 
concurrent disease or other drugs or chemicals. The event must be 
pharmacologically or pheno menologically definitive. 
Probably 
Related There is evidence to suggest a causal relationship, and the influence of 
other factors is unlikely. The clin ical event, including an abnormal 
laboratory test result, occurs within a reasonable time after administration 
of the drug or use of device, is unlikely to be attributed to concurrent 
disease or other drugs or chemicals. 
Possibly 
Related There is some evidence to suggest a causal relationship (eg, the event 
occurred within a reasonable time after administration of the trial 
medication or use of device). However, other factors may have contributed to the event (eg, the participant’s clinical condition, other concomitant 
events). Although an AE may rate only as “possibly related” soon after 
discovery, it can be flagged as requiri ng more information and later be 
upgraded to “probably related” or “definitely related”, as appropriate. 
Not Related The adverse event is completely independent of study drug administration 
or use of device, and/or evidence exists  that the event is definitely related 
to another etiology.

17.5 Investigator SAE Reporting Requirements 
An SAE occurring during the study or within 30 days of stopping the treatment must 
be reported to the study safety monitor. Any such SAE due to any cause, whether or 
not related to the study medication, must be  reported within 24 hours of occurrence or 
when the investigator beco mes aware of the event.  
The investigator must send a preliminary report of any such SAE to the project 
manager via the EDC system within 24 hours or if this is not possible via email or fax using an SAE Report Form, or at a minimum by telephone.   
The event must be recorded on the electr onic SAE CRF page. Preliminary reports of 
SAEs must be followed by detailed descr iptions, including clear pseudonymized 
photocopies of hospital case reports, consu ltant reports, autops y reports, and other 
documents when requested and applicable . All photocopies should be redacted to 
remove study subjects’ persona l details and annotated with the patient’s unique study 
identifiers. SAE reports must be made whet her or not the investigator considers the 
event to be related to the investigational drug.  Appropriate remedial measures should 
be taken to treat the SAE, and the response to treatment should be recorded. Study 
subjects must be closely followed until suffici ent information is obtained to indicate a 
return to normal status or until the ev ent stabilizes at a level acceptable to the 
investigator.

20.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS - ENDPOINTS, HYPOTHESES, AND 
 ANALYTICAL METHODS 
20.1 Power and Sample Size Calculation 
The study will enroll up to 125 patients with the goal to have 100 evaluable subjects 
(after accounting for a 20% attrition rate of  subjects who are enrolled and treated) in a 
prospective, non-randomized, multi-center st udy. The following assumptions were used 
to determine the required sample size for the study: 
 This study would have an attrition rate of subjects enrolled and treated no greater 
than 20%. 
 A mean reduction of 28% in the primary efficacy endpoint (RV/LV diameter 
ratio) after 48 hours in BEC-treated patie nts.  It will be compared to the 
performance goal of 20% reduction in RV/LV diameter ratio after 48 hours. 
 A standard deviation (SD) on the scale of percent change for the primary efficacy 
endpoint (RV/LV ratio) of 25%. 
 An interim analysis will be conducted on ce data on 60 participants have been 
collected, in order to obtain preliminary efficacy results using the primary 
efficacy endpoint. To constrain the overa ll type I error rate, an O’Brien-Fleming 
alpha spending function will be utilized, in which a stringent type I error rate of 
alpha=0.0038 will be used for the interi m analysis, leaving alpha=0.0212 for the 
final analysis, when study data are complete. 
Alpha values for interim and final analyses were obtained from the R package ldbounds 
function bounds(), which calculates alpha give n the type of spending function, timing 
of the interim analyses, and overall type I erro r desired.  The parameters used to obtain 
these alpha values were O’Brien-Fleming spending function, single interim analysis at 
60% of total sample, and overall alpha of 0.025 (one-sided).

Protocol THRO-CLIN-2019-01 Version  4.0         August 18, 2020          Page 48 of 74 
This protocol is confidential prop erty of Thrombolex, Inc and in no wa y should be distributed all or in 
part without written permission from Thrombolex, Inc. The sample size needed for 80% power to test  the primary efficacy hypothesis in the 
final analysis is 83 subjects, based on the assumptions stated above, and alpha = 0.0212.6   
This estimate is based on a one-sided one-sam ple t-test of mean percent change from 
baseline to 48-hour assessment, comparing the pe rcent change in RV/LV ratio that is 
predicted in this study with a 20% reduction. 
20.2 Endpoints, Hypotheses, and Analytical Methods 
20.2.1  Primary Efficacy Endpoint:  
The primary efficacy endpoint is reduction in the chest CT-measured RV/LV diameter 
ratio assessed by contrast enhanced chest CT from baseline within  48 ± 6 hours of 
initiation of treatment.  
20.2.2  Hypothesis:  
The predicate device for Bashir Endovascula r Catheter is the EkoSonic Endovascular 
System (EKOS, Bothell, WA). The SEATTLE II Study reported a reduction in RV/LV 
diameter ratio of -0.42 ± 0.36 (mean ± SD ) in 115 patients who underwent a within-
window CT measurement of RV/LV diameter ratio. We hypothesize that RV/LV 
diameter ratio measured at 48 hours compared  with measured ratio at baseline will be 
reduced on average by more than 20%. 
20.2.2.1 Analytical methods:   A change score d will be calculated:  
𝒅ൌ   𝑹𝟒𝟖െ𝑹𝟎
𝑹𝟎 
that expresses the change as a propor tion of the baseline value, where R 0 and R 48 are  ୖ୚
୐୚ 
at time 0 and 48 hours post-treatment, respectively.  A larger decrease from baseline 
will result in a change score with a greater magnitude and a negative sign.  The change 
score will be compared to the benchmark va lue of 20% in a one-sided hypothesis test: 
𝑯𝟎:𝒅൒െ 𝟎 .𝟐 
𝑯𝑨:𝒅൏െ 𝟎 .𝟐 
The distribution of the change score will be examined to assess whether the normality 
assumption is met, using both graphical methods  (Q-Q plots and histograms) as well as 
multiple hypothesis tests of norma lity (Shapiro-Wilk, Kolmogorov-Smirnov, 
Anderson-Darling, and Cramer-von Mises).  Multiple hypothesis testing methods will 
be employed to assess normality because the c hoice of the most powerful test depends 
on the distributional qualities of the data; if the different tests do not result in the same 
conclusion, more weight will be given to the method that is best suited to the observed 
distributional qualities of the data ( e.g., heaviness of tails).  If the data are determined 
to be normal based on these methods, a t test will be done; if not, a one-sample Wilcoxon

In addition, the t-test will be presented for the primary endpoint analysis regardless of 
the normality of the test results. 
The test will be performed twice: once at the interim analysis (with α=0.0038) and once 
at the final analysis (with α=0.0212).  If the p-value is less than α at either analysis, then 
the test will be considered statistically significant.  
20.2.3  Primary Safety Endpoint:  
The primary safety endpoint is major bleed ing within 72 hours of procedure initiation 
of r-tPA infusion (the start of the infu sion). Bleeding events are classified by the 
International Society of Thro mbosis and Hemostasis (ISTH).  
20.2.4  Hypothesis:  
The comparator device for Bashir Endovascu lar Catheter is the EkoSonic Endovascular 
System (EKOS, Bothell, WA), and results from the study evaluating the safety and 
efficacy of this device were the basis fo r the performance goal of 14.9% proposed for 
this study. The SEATTLE II Study reported a 10%  (standard error=2. 45%) of moderate 
to severe bleeding in treated subjects within 72 hours of the treatment initiation.  The 
hypothesis is that the bleeding rate in this study will not exceed 10% + 2*SE = 14.9%.  
A one-sided, one-sample exact test of a binomial proportion p will be used to test the 
hypotheses below. 
𝑯𝟎: 𝒑൒𝟎 .𝟏𝟒𝟗 
𝑯𝑨:𝒑൏𝟎 .𝟏𝟒𝟗 
The hypothesis test for the primary safety endpoint will not be done at the interim 
analysis, but only at the end of the study.  This test will have a type I error rate of 0.025. 
20.2.5  Secondary Endpoints:  
Descriptive statistics will be generated fo r the secondary endpoints listed below.  For 
continuous measures (e.g., Modified Miller  Index comparing 48 hours post therapy to 
baseline), the mean and 95% confidence limits will be calculated, along with the 
median, standard deviation and range.  For frequency outcomes (e.g., device success), 
results will be reported as the overall frequenc y of occurrence as well as the percentage 
of subjects.    
1. Device Success: The number of devices with therapy delivered without a device 
failure. 
2. Refined Miller Score as measured on contrast enhanced chest CT (CTA) within 48 
hours after the completion of the r-tPA in fusion compared to baseline as measured 
by core lab.  
3. All-cause mortality at hospital disch arge through 30-day follow-up.

5. AEs through 30-day follow-up. 
6. UADEs through 30-day follow-up. 
7. Recurrent PE through 30-day follow-up.  
8. Clinically Relevant Non-Major bleeding: Any sign or symptom of hemorrhage 
(e.g. more bleeding than would be expected  for a clinical circumstance, including 
bleeding found by imaging alone) that does not fit the criteria for the ISTH 
definition of major bleeding but does meet at least one of the following criteria:  
a. Requiring medical intervention by a healthcare professional.  
b. Leading to hospitalization or increased level of care.  
c. Prompting a face to face (i.e., not just a telephone or electronic 
communication) evaluation.  
9. Technical procedural complications. 
10. Systolic PA pressure measured at comp letion of infusion after BEC(s) removal 
and compared to baseline. 
11. Cardiac output (CO by Modified Fick calculation in Protocol) and cardiac index 
(CI) following completion of the r-tPA infusion compared to the baseline. 
20.2.6  Poolability, Subgroup, and Sensitivity Analysis  
To assess poolability by study site, analyses will be done that test whether study site is 
a predictor of the primary efficacy and saf ety outcomes.  Two regression models will 
be fit: a linear regression model having RV/LV diameter ratio as the dependent variable, 
and a logistic regression model having whet her major bleeding occurred (as defined by 
ISTH within 72 hours of initiation of r-tPA infusion) as the dependent variable.  Each 
model will include site as an in dependent variable and test the hypothesis that study site 
was a significant predictor of each dependent va riable.  If the hypothesis tests show that 
site is not a significant predictor of either outcome, it will be concluded that the study 
sites do not differ substantially in terms of  outcome, and the data from sites will be 
pooled for analysis of all primar y and secondary endpoints.   
For the primary endpoints, descriptive statis tics by site will be listed: the mean ± 
standard deviation, minimum, and maximu m RV/LV diameter ratio, and the proportion 
of patients experiencing major bleeding, will  be calculated for each study site and 
presented in a table to facilitate site comparisons.  
If the hypothesis tests reveal site differen ces for either outcome, analyses will be 
performed to compare study sites in term s of participant baseline characteristics ( e.g., 
demographics, medical history) as well as othe r variables that could influence clinical 
outcome such as eligibility criteria.  Anal yses of primary and secondary endpoints will 
be conducted separately for each study site, and the results of the site comparisons will 
be used to inform how to in terpret site-specific results. 
Subgroup analyses will be performed to dete rmine if RV/LV diameter ratio and the 
proportion of patients experiencing major bleed ing differ by demographic variables age,

maximum RV/LV diameter ratio, and the pr oportion of patients experiencing major 
bleeding) will be calculated for each demogr aphic subgroup and presented in a table to 
facilitate group comparisons.  Regression m odels will be fit (linear regression for 
RV/LV diameter ratio, logistic regressi on for major bleeding) having each primary 
endpoint as the dependent variable and dem ographic group as the independent variable.  
A separate regression model will be fit fo r each combination of endpoint and 
demographic variable to formally test the hypothesis of subgroup differences in each 
primary endpoint.  
Sensitivity analyses will be undertaken to assess the impact of missing data for the 
primary endpoints.   The methods for this an alysis are described in detail in Section 8 
of the Statistical Analysis Plan (THR O-STAT-2019-01), “Handling of Dropouts and 
Missing Data.” If subjects become COVID-19 positive after enrollment and during the 
study, a subgroup analysis will be performed. Refer to Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) 
(THRO-STAT-2019-01) for additional details. 
20.3 Analysis Populations  
All enrolled subjects who receive the study treatment will be included in the Intent-to-
Treat (ITT) population.  The ITT will consis t of subjects who both provide informed 
consent to participate and have the BEC (or first of two BECs for bilateral PE) 
introduced into the sheath. The modified ITT (mITT) population are evaluable subjects 
defined as members of the ITT who have data available to assess the primary efficacy 
endpoint of reduction in RV/LV ratio as m easured by contrast-enhanced chest CT 
(CTA) at screening and RV/LV ratio as measured by contrast-enhanced CTA at 48 
hours after completion of r-tPA treatment.  The patients comprising the mITT 
population are evaluable patients.  Members of the ITT population who remain in the 
study long enough to comple te the 30-day follow-up period will comprise the Per-
Protocol (PP) population.   
The mITT population will be used to analyze the primary efficacy endpoint.  The ITT 
population will be used to analyze the primary safety endpoint, as well as all secondary 
safety and device endpoints that do not require 30 days of follow-up ( e.g., device 
success, clinically relevant non-major bleedi ng, technical procedural complications).  
The PP population will be used to analyze sec ondary endpoints that require 30 days of 
follow-up: all-cause mortality, SAEs, AEs, UADEs, and recurrent PE through 30-day 
follow-up).   
Up to 125 subjects, in up to 20 sites, will be  enrolled and treated, with the objective to 
have at least 100 subjects complete the 30-day follow-up period, and be included in the 
primary efficacy analysis.  Each site will ha ve an enrollment cap such that no more than 
20% (n=20) of participants are enrolled at a single site.

A Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will be selected to review the study conduct, 
feasibility data, and safety data and will review all types of adverse events reported in this study 
and adjudicate as required.  The independent DS MB shall have the final adjudication for the 
events.  A data safety charter will be est ablished and will be approved by the DSMB.  
Qualifications for the DSMB members, at a mi nimum, shall include current experience with 
catheter directed thrombolysis for the treatment  of submassive pulmonary  emboli, management 
of the patient post-treatment and extensive resear ch experience. Adherence to the study stopping 
criteria in this protocol will also be included in  the DSMB meetings in addition to following the 
charter.   
The DSMB shall have CEC responsibilities as we ll.  This hybrid committee include CEC 
responsibilities that include providing an independent  expert review of data on clinical events 
based on protocol-specific definitions.  The CEC review ensures that events critical to the 
analysis of study results are assessed in a unifo rm manner. This facilitates reliable pooling of 
data within a trial and with predicate trials and improves the validity of comparisons with 
published data.  In addition to study endpoints, the CEC will provide asses sment of other events 
or areas of concern at the request of the DSMB or Sponsor (e.g., device malfunction or failure, 
serious anticipated adverse events versus ser ious unanticipated adverse events). Member 
selection will be based on: 
 Balanced composition;  
 Relevant expertise;  
 Complete independence from the Sponsor and conduct of the trial;  
 Evaluation and documentation of an y Conflict of Interest; and  
 Commitment to flexible schedules for th e duration of the project life cycle. 
22.0 STUDY STOPPING RULES 
22.1 General Study Stopping Rules 
The Sponsor, DSMB, IRBs, regulatory authorities, or the principal investigators may 
make recommendations to terminate the study if the safety and well-being of the 
subjects are in jeopardy.  
If the study is terminated or suspended, pr ompt notification will be provided to all 
parties involved in the conduct of the study. 
Patient enrollment may be paused or termin ated early if the Sponsor or DSMB, and/or 
CEC determines that the potential benefits of  the investigational device are unlikely to 
outweigh the risks associated with continuation of the trial.

22.2.1  Intracranial Hemorrhage 
If three (3) patients undergoing the investigational procedure experience an 
unprovoked intracranial hemorrhage, c onfirmed by independent CEC/DSMB 
adjudication, and did not have a protocol  violation such that he/she cannot be 
considered as representative of the in tended patient population, the study shall 
be paused for re-evaluati on, and may be stopped.  
22.2.2  Bleeding 
Should severe bleeding occur in 12 study subjects, the study will be paused, and 
the pharmacotherapy dosage and admini stration will be re-evaluated.  
22.2.3  Ad Hoc Criteria for CEC/DSMB Meetings 
1. If there are two (2) intracranial bleeds or eight (8) major bleeds within the 
first 60 subjects, an ad hoc meeting will occur for adjudication of the 
events.    
2. An ad hoc meeting will take place if any untoward event that, in the 
opinion of the chair, warrants an ad-hoc meeting.  
22.3 Device Study Stopping Rules 
22.3.1  Device Related SAEs 
Should it be suspected that a device cause d a serious adverse event, the serious 
adverse event will be adjudicated by the independent DSMB and the device 
shall be returned to the manufacturer.  A root cause analysis shall be performed. 
The DSMB will determine if the st udy should be stopped, temporarily 
suspended, or continued after each such event. 
22.3.2  Device Malfunctions and Non-conformances 
There are device malfunctions, or non-conformances, that may impact the 
patient and prevent treatment with an investigational device.  Upon commencement of enrollment, if there ar e device failures that prevent a total of 
five (5) subjects across two or more study sites (e.g. site 01 has three (3) device 
malfunctions, and site 05 has two (2) device malfunctions) from being treated 
in this study, the study shall be paused for re-evaluation of the device.  A root 
cause analysis will be performed to determ ine the cause(s) of the device failures 
and a corrective and preventative action will be implemented.

The Impact Assessment Form will be  completed by each site and subm itted to the CRO representative. 
The investigational site operations will be evaluated to determine im pact of the COVID-19 Pandemic.  
The Impact Assessment Form will be  reviewed with the sponsor.   
STEP 2 Alternate Study Plans 
The CRO representative will review the Impact Asse ssment Form with the sponsor and will contact 
the site to confirm the site’s proposed appropriate  alternative plan under the following conditions: 
 
1. Patient enrollment activities cannot be co nducted in full compliance with the current 
protocol. 
If the impact affects the ability to complete any of the required activities for study enrollment, the 
site will not be activated, or enrollment will be su spended if the site was previously activated, until 
full operations can be restored. A Suspension of Study Due to COVID-19 Notice will be issued to 
the site. The investigator will submit the notice to the participating IRB.  
 
2. Patient follow-up cannot be conducted in fu ll compliance with the current protocol. 
If the impact affects the follow-up visits for patie nts who have already been enrolled and treated 
with the study device, follow-up should be comp leted according to the protocol if possible. The 
Impact Assessment Form will be completed and submitted to the CRO representative. Based on 
the information given in the Impact Assessment Form, a follow-up plan for the site should be 
provided by the site on the Impact Assessment Fo rm to the CRO. Additionally, the investigator 
will submit the completed Impact Assessme nt Form to the participating IRB. 
STEP 3 Restoration of Clinical Research Operations 
1. Resuming Clinical Research Operations 
As soon as the site can confirm that clinical rese arch operations have resumed, or a due date is 
defined for resumption, the site will notify the CRO representative.  
 
2. Activation Letter 
The CRO, with approval from the study sponsor, w ill issue an Activation Letter or Addendum to 
the Suspension of Study Due to COVID-19 Notice with  an effective date. This will restore the site 
to resume active status and return to a ll activities as defined per the protocol.

1. DESCRIPTION OF THE POPULATION 
 
Age 18 years of age to ≤ 75 years of age, have a filling defect in at least one main or lobar pulmonary 
artery as determined on contrast enhanced ch est CT Scan (CTA), RV/LV diameter ratio ≥ 0.9 by 
contrast enhanced chest CT scan (CTA) as determin ed by the investigative site.  They must not 
have had a CVA or TIA within one (1) year, head trauma, active intracranial,  or intraspinal disease 
within one (1) year prior to inclusion in the study, any active bleeding from a major organ within 
one (1) month prior to inclusion in the study, an intracranial condition(s) that may increase the risk 
of bleeding, a bleeding diatheses, a hematocrit le ss than 30, platelet count less than 100,000/ μL, 
INR greater than 1.5 if currently on warfarin (Coumadin®), and each patient cannot have  an aPTT 
greater than 50 seconds in the absence of anticoagul ants.  Please see section 6.3 for a complete list 
of eligibility criteria.   
2. OVERVIEW OF EFFICACY 
The Bashir™ Endovascular Catheter is intende d for the controlled and selective infusion of 
physician-specified fluids, including thrombolytics, into the peripheral vasculature.  A First-in-man 
study was recently completed for the treatment of subjects with submassive pulmonary embolism.  
The study included administration of r-tPA through the BEC in the form of pulse sprays followed 
by an infusion over eight hours.  Subjects with unilateral embolism were administered a 2mg pulse 
spray through the basket of the BEC into the pu lmonary artery (PA) followed by an infusion of 
10mg over approximately eight hours for a total do se of 12 mg.  Subjects with bilateral embolisms 
were administered 2mg pulse sprays into each pulm onary artery followed by an infusion of 5mg of 
r-tPA into each PA over eight hours for a total of 14mg.  Nine subjects were enrolled and treated.  
After 48 hours the RV/LV ratio decreased from 1.54  0.26 to 0.97  0.06 (p = .001: 95% CI = 
0.33 to 0.82: 36.7% reduction) as assessed by an in dependent core lab (Medical Metrics, Houston, 
TX). Thrombus burden measured by Modified M iller Index as assessed by the independent core 
lab (Medical Metrics, Houston, TX) decreased from 25.4  5.3 to 16.0  4.0 (p = .001: 95% CI = 
5.5 to 13.4: 37.1% reduction).

Risk Types  Definition 
Basic Safety Protection against physician hazards , which should be addressed and 
mitigated with a reasonable level of certainty. 
Device Related SAEs Events attributable to the investig ational use of the device which produce 
an injury that is life threatening, results in permanent impairment or damage to the body, or requires medical or surgical intervention to prevent permanent harm to the body. 
Device Related AEs  (non-serious) Events attributable to the investigational use of the device which do not 
produce an injury or illness that is life-threatening, does not result in permanent impairment or damage to the body, or does not require 
medical or surgical intervention to prevent permanent harm to the body. 
Procedure-related 
Complications Due to 
the Investigation This includes not just the device use, but risks related to the investigation 
itself to which the subject would otherwise not be exposed, e.g. risk of 
anesthesia during procedures involving an investigational device. 
Risks associated with the study itself Risks the subject may be exposed to that do not directly result from use 
of the device and would not be expected as part of usual care outside of 
the investigational setting. Examples include additional procedures (such 
as medical imaging) for ascertainment of study endpoints. 
Risk from false-positive or false-negative results for diagnostics N/A – The BEC is not a diagnostic device. 
 
A description and analysis of the risks to research  subjects related to the device and the study are 
listed below for each category in Table 3 above.  
Basic Safety: Physician hazards may include exposur e to blood and body fluids, which is standard 
for any invasive procedure in the interventional la b.  Physicians and sta ff wear personal protective 
equipment to prevent exposure.  This is not uni que to the investigational device in the RESCUE 
study.  There is no electrical power required for this device, so electrical safety issues are not 
relevant.   
Device Related SAEs or Device Related AEs (Non-Serious):   Device related SAEs may include 
allergic reactions, hematoma at access site, hemorrhage, intimal dama ge, ischemia, pain and 
tenderness, vascular thrombosis, vessel perforation,  and vessel spasm.  These adverse events will 
be categorized as serious only if one of the following conditions applies:  
An adverse event is any undesirable experience as sociated with the use of a medical product in a 
patient. The event is serious and will be collected when the patient outcome is:

This protocol is confidential propert y of Thrombolex, Inc and in no way sh ould be distributed all or in part 
without written permission from Thrombolex, Inc. 1. Death 
2. Life-threatening -  Report if suspected that the patient was at substantial risk of 
dying at the time of the adverse event or use or continued use of the device or other 
medical product might have resulted in the death of the patient.  
3. Hospitalization (initial or prolonged) - Report if admission to the hospital or 
prolongation of hospitalization was a result of the adverse event. 
Emergency room visits that do not result in admission to the hospital should be 
evaluated for one of the other serious outcomes (e.g., life-threatening; required 
intervention to prevent permanent impairment or damage; other serious medically 
important event).  
4. Disability or Permanent Damage - Report if the adverse event resulted in a 
substantial disruption of a person's ability to conduct normal li fe functions, i.e., 
the adverse event resulted in a signific ant, persistent or permanent change, 
impairment, damage or disruption in the pa tient's body function/structure, physical 
activities and/or quality of life. 
5. Congenital Anomaly/Birth Defect - Report if you suspect that exposure to a 
medical product prior to conception or duri ng pregnancy may have resulted in an 
adverse outcome in the child. 
6. Required Intervention to Prevent Permanent Impairment  or Damage (Devices) - 
Report if you believe that medical or surgical intervention was necessary to 
preclude permanent impairment of a body function, or prevent permanent damage 
to a body structure, either situation suspected to be due to the use of a medical 
product. 
7. Other Serious (Important Medical Events) - Report when the event does not fit the 
other outcomes, but the event may jeopardize the patient and may require medical 
or surgical intervention (treatment) to prevent one of the other outcomes. 
Examples include allergic bronchospasm (a serious problem with breathing) 
requiring treatment in an emergency room, serious blood dyscrasias (blood 
disorders) or seizures/convulsions that do not result in hospitalization. The 
development of drug dependence or drug abuse would also be examples of 
important medical events.  
 
Procedure Related Complications Due to the Investigation:  These complications are unrelated 
to the BEC and may include access site pseudoane urysm, anemia, arrhythm ia, bleeding requiring 
blood transfusion, cardiac arrest, death, ecchymos is, hematuria, hemodynamic instability, heparin 
induced thrombocytopenia, infec tion, pain at access site, perfo ration, pneumothorax, pulmonary 
infarct, shock, skin necrosis (if on warfarin).  
Risks Associated with the Study Itself : The risks associated with  the study itself are discussed 
below. The additional risks are not expect ed to be above standard of care.

This protocol is confidential propert y of Thrombolex, Inc and in no way sh ould be distributed all or in part 
without written permission from Thrombolex, Inc. B. Risk Mitigation and Risk Minimization 
 
1. Basic Safety:  There is no expected increase in basic safety concerns.  The sites selected 
are highly experienced in the protection from blood borne pathogens and the use of the 
BEC does not increase this risk.  Additionally , regarding radiation exposure for the staff 
and physicians, the procedure times are s hort compared to some interventional 
procedures.  The procedure time in the Firs t-in-Man study from local anesthetic to last 
wire out of the patient was a mean of 57 minutes (with a range of 43 minutes to 72 
minutes).  
 
2.  Device Related SAEs:   Allergic reaction – Staff monitor the subject for reactions and 
medicate the study subject accordingly.   
Hematoma at access site – This is potentially due to the venous stic k technique.  We are 
minimizing the potential for a hematoma by requiring the use of ultrasound guidance at 
the time of obtaining access either in the femo ral vein or the internal jugular vein.   
Hemorrhage – We are preventing hemorrhage by only selecting physicians in the study 
who are experienced in PM-CDT and hemodyna mic monitoring.  Having this expertise 
prior to study site selection will minimize the possibility of hemorrhage due to 
perforation.  Additionally, the dose of r-tPA is  less than the dose in other studies.  The 
RESCUE protocol requires a certain heparin do se and lovenox dose.  This is to prevent 
over anti-coagulation in the study subjects.   
Intimal damage – There is the potential fo r intimal damage with any interventional 
procedure within the vasculatu re.  This is minimized by the use of the long sheaths and 
the assessment under fluoroscopy of the basket expanding in the pulmonary vasculature.  
Ischemia may be minimized by shorter pr ocedure times, shorter time to improved 
ventilation and perfusion in the pulmonary embolism patient.   
Vascular thrombosis is prevente d with anti-coagulation.   
Vessel perforation is prevented by choosing experienced operators who have extensive 
experience with catheter-based therapies and PM-CDT.   
Vessel spasm may occur but can be minimized  with highly experienced operators.  The 
potential for spasm is much less in venous treatment than with arterial treatment.   
 
3. Procedure-Related Complications: The procedure-related co mplications listed above 
will be mitigated by selecting experienced operato rs, lab staff, and research staff.  In the 
First-in-Man study use in the pulmonary artery, the device was inserted through a long 
sheath that was placed in the pulmonary artery  prior to the BEC insertion.  This allows 
for easy insertion from the sheath outside of the patient into the right side of the heart 
and the pulmonary artery within the sheath.   The physicians place the device in the 
interventional lab by advancing it through th e sheath, and by viewing the radiopaque 
infusion basket under fluoroscopy.  The entire basket is made of nitinol components; 
therefore, the entire basket is radiopaque under fluoroscopy.  This same technique will 
be used in the RESCUE study.  This mi nimizes the possibility of the BEC causing 
damage to the vasculature when bei ng inserted through the vasculature.

without written permission from Thrombolex, Inc. 4. Risks Associated with the Study Itself: The CTA imaging is a requirement for the 
primary endpoint analysis.  Site staff will be trained on the image acquisition protocol 
and they will be qualified in advance to ensu re they have the proper imaging equipment 
to perform the tests.  Both of these requi rements should help reduce the exposure that 
could result from redoing study-required imaging.  If the 48-hour CTA is not standard 
of care, one extra CTA would be required for the study subject, a small increase in 
radiation exposure. The in-lab imaging is standard of care for the practicing 
interventionalist.  
 
C. Summary 
  Overall, the actions taken to mitigate risks include the following: 
1. Select qualified sites and investigators that meet strict criteria; 
2. Provide detailed didactic and hands-on device training; 
3. Ensure all investigators inspect the devi ce and prep the device and test it for 
functionality before use; 
4. Provide core lab requirement training; 
5. Support study procedure as needed with procedure and research experts to guide 
physicians and staff. 
 
5. POTENTIAL BENEFITS 
The potential benefit from BEC treatment of pulm onary embolism is effective treatment for the 
condition, as reduction in clot burden has b een demonstrated by RV/LV ratio reduction and 
decrease in refined Modified Miller Score in the Fi rst-in-Man study.  Additionally, there may be a 
lower bleeding risk with the BEC because of low r-tPA dose and shorter infusion times compared 
to what was required in SEATTLE II.  The design of the BEC creates multiple channels where 
blood can flow to increased exposure of the clot su rface area to fluid, e ndogenous lytics, exogenous 
lytics (e.g., r-tPA), thus potentially having a greater reduction in clot burden than other PM-CDT 
devices that create only a single channel.  This benefit remains to be seen in a larger population; 
therefore, the RESCUE study is being conducted.   
6. CONCLUSIONS 
As demonstrated in the First-in-Man study, the potential benefits outweigh the risks of treating 
patients with the BEC.

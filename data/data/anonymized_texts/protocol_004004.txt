In vivo knee kinematics will be assessed for 80 subjects that have been implanted with either a 
Smith & Nephew Journey II posterior cruciate re taining (PCR) [40 subj ects] or bi-cruciate 
retaining (BCR) [40 subjects] tota l knee arthroplasty (TKA) who ar e patients of Dr. Cates or Dr. 
Freeman.   Enrollment and testing will be increas ed to 45 patients per implant model to ensure 
the necessary 80 usable datasets are acquired and also to account for any subjects that may drop 
out of the study. All TKAs should be judged clini cally successful (KSS > 80).  A KSS score of 
greater than 90 is deemed to be  excellent by the Knee Society.  E ach subject should have a well-
functioning prosthesis, be at least three months post-operative, and should have good-to-
excellent post-operati ve passive flexion.  
    Deciding which patients received which kind of implant was up to the discretion of Dr. Harold 
Cates or Dr. Mark Freeman, according to their pr ofessional opinions. The determination as to 
which type of implant patients received is outside  the scope of this particular study. Subjects will 
already have the knee implants and must be at  least three months post-operative. Bilateral 
subjects will not be included in the study populations.  Inclusion criteria:  
1. Subjects will have either a Smith & Nephew J ourney II posterior cruc iate retaining (PCR) 
[45 subjects] or bi-cruciate reta ining (BCR) [45 subjects] TKA. 
2. Patients must be at least three months post-operative. 
3. Participants must be judged clinically succe ssful with their most recent new Knee Society 
score equal to or greater than 80. 
4. Weigh < 250  
5. BMI < 40 
6. Must be >40 years of age 
7. Participants must be able to perform the required activitie s without concern.  
8. Subjects must be willing to sign the Informed Consent (IC) form to participate in the study.  
 
Exclusion criteria: 
1. Pregnant, potentially pregnant, lactat ing females or of childbearing age.
 To satisfy 
radiation protocol, each female  subject will be asked if she is pregnant, or possibly 
could be pregnant. A pregnant person will not  be allowed to participate in the study. 
2. Subjects without the required  type of knee implant.

Recruitment 
Up to forty-five patients will have been impl anted with a Smith & Nephew Journey II posterior 
cruciate retaining (PCR) and 45 patients will have  been implanted with a bi-cruciate retaining 
(BCR) whose post-operative condit ions permit them to capably  perform the study activities. 
Research staff from Dr. Cate s’ Research Foundation or Dr. Freeman’s practice at Erlanger 
Orthopaedics will determine potential participants for the study by reviewing medical files. The 
surgeon’s research staff will review the patient’ s KSS, clinical dictati on, and electronic health 
record (EHR), and he will approve or reject the patient as a candidate for the study. During 
review of medical files, the research staff w ill utilize the CMR Recruitment/Enrollment checklist 
(Attachment 6) to ensure that each potential subject meets all eligibility requirements prior to 
being contacted. This sheet included a checklist of the inclusion criteria, as well as a field for the

5/3/2019 research staff to include a subject identifier so the subject’s eligibility can once again be 
confirmed on the day of data collection. Once this  sheet has been completed by the staff, it will 
be submitted to a UT Research Coordinator, lead  researcher or PI/Co-PI/Sub-I to review and 
authorize recruitment and enrollment. After a poten tially eligible subject has been identified and 
authorized to be enrolled in the study, s/he will be contacted for a visit to the surgeon’s office to 
be consented. The subject will then be consen ted and scheduled for fluoroscopy data collection 
at the Tennessee Orthopaedic Cl inic in Knoxville, TN.  All testing collecti on at Tennessee 
Orthopaedic Clinic will be schedul ed after normal clinic hours so as not to interfere with the 
patient treatments occurring during the day.  
 
Data Collection 
University of Tennessee researchers with experi ence conducting fluoroscopic research studies, as 
well as either a PI/Co-PI/Sub-I for the study, and possibly Dr. Cates’ staff will be present during 
the fluoroscopy procedure to walk subjects through the activities. A radiation technician (RT) 
employed by the Tennessee Orthopaedic Clinic w ill collect fluoroscopic video while subjects 
perform the following activities: walking up a nd down a ramp, deep knee bend and rising from 
the DKB position.  
   Prior to starting data collection, UT researcher s will complete the second portion of the CMR 
Recruitment/Enrollment checklist to ensure subjects meet elig ibility requirements to document 
inclusion criteria for compliance purposes. Age and weight will be verified at the time of 
fluoroscopy to ensure eligibility. If  a subject does not meet the inclusion criteria, s/he will not be 
tested. If the participant still m eets all study criteria, s/he will be  asked to practice the activities 
to ensure s/he can comfortably complete them and experience no pain with  the clinic fluoroscopy 
machine off (no radiation).  The practice portion of the data collection without radiation will not 
be video-recorded. During the fluoroscopy pro cedure, the RT will follow the motion of the 
implanted knee with the fluoroscopy machine;
 only the knee joint (from the fluoroscopy 
machine) will be recorded on the fluoroscopy footag e. The participant will be allowed to rest as 
necessary and be instructed  to stop the activity at th e first sign of pain.  
 Multiple trials of each activity ma y be conducted to ensure usable images have been acquired to 
complete the study. Radiation time will be kept as low as reasonably achievable (ALARA) and 
will not exceed two minutes. The RT will start the fluoroscope just prior to the subject beginning 
each activity trial and will stop the fluoroscope  immediately after the subject completes each 
activity trial to ensure that the subj ect is not exposed during idol periods. 
 The fluoroscopic footage for these activities will be stored on digital video files on a secure computer workstation, uploaded onto the secure  CMR database by the UT researcher that 
attended data collection, where identifiable da ta will be removed and substituted for data that 
cannot identify the subject (e.g., dates of birth will be removed and replaced with number of 
months the individual has been alive). Subjects will be assigned study and subject-specific 
identifiers which is how the system  will distinguish the datasets.   
   
SPECIFIC RISKS AND PROTECTION MEASURES

As with every clinical study, there may be some risks.  Ho wever, doses of radiation exposure 
received will be much lower than those known to produce detectable health effects.  Previously 
reported literature shows that fluoroscopy-ba sed procedure (angiogra phy) on the lower limb 
result in a typical effective dose of 0.83 mSv per min (0.0083 rem per min) (Verdun1).  Mettler, 
et al have reported that the typical effective dose for a conve ntional knee pro cedure is 0.005 mSv 
(0.00005 rem)2.  According to either estimate, the a dditional risk of a fluoroscopic procedure 
involving the knee ranges between "Negligible" to "Low" for a 2 minute exam (Verdun).  A 
previous fluoroscopy TKA study conducted at anot her hospital with a 2 minute on-time limit 
shows that the average effective dose was 0.14 mSv (0.0014 rem) with a maximum dose of 0.27 
mSv (0.0027 rem).  The additional risk for all subjects in this prev ious study would be 
considered "Negligible".  To account for subj ect variability and differences in imagining 
techniques, all subjects enrolled in this study will receive less than 4 rem.  4 rem is considered "Very Low" risk.  It is unlikely that anyone in this study will approach the 4 rem limit. Since the 
fluoroscopy data will be collect ed in one session, there will on ly be one day in which the 
participants will be exposed to  this amount of radiation. 
 In conclusion, a participant who will be fluoroscoped for less than two minutes will be exposed 
to a maximum  amount of only 4.0 rems of radiation. This means that the maximum total 
exposure rate will be less than 4 rems per subj ect for the entire experiment (Attachments 3 and 
4).  The participant's knee joint will be fluoroscoped using minimal risk levels of radiation according to published litera ture (Attachment 2).  
  The participant has the right to stop the procedure at any time; researchers or the RT can end the 
procedures at any time if they feel the participant is at risk, but the participan t can choose to 
remain in the study if she/he f eels that there is no risk to her/his surgical procedure or 
recuperation.   We are estimating a total maximum time of 45 minutes to permit the subject time to complete the IC form, ask any questions s/he may have, practic e the activities or repeat any activities that 
could not be completed, and collect all necessary fluoroscopy data from each subject.   
2. Participant Confidentiality  
The investigator will ensure subject confidentiality to the extent that is permissible by law is 
maintained throughout the study and after. Co mplete confidentiality cannot be guaranteed. 
 
Hard Copy 
In compliance with HIPAA regulations, all particip ants will have their identities withheld from 
all public files. The personnel in the following lis t will have access to pa rticipant PHI for the

Clinical Observations: 
There are no clinical observati ons made during this data collec tion or from the images obtained 
through data collection. There will be no radiology report generated for this procedure conducted 
as a result of this study. Therefore, no RT will review such a report for the procedures, which would be the only way such a “significant problem ” would be determined. It is not anticipated 
that the imaging collected during this study would pot entially provide benefit to specific subjects 
by influencing the surgeon’s treatment plan.
 
 
BENEFITS 
The potential benefits from this study include, but are not limited to: 
• Better understanding of the joints analyzed  with the same technique in the past. 
• Future implant design improvements based on the kinematic findings. 
• New and advanced surgical techniqu es for TKA based on the results.

5/3/2019 • There is no intention of any direct benefit to participants of the st udy accept they will be 
able to see their implant on the video monito r and the fluoroscopic video will be assessed 
by the research team.  
 
The researchers have been conducting fluoroscopi c exams for 25 years.  In those previous 
studies, subjects participated a nd the findings from those studie s have led to implant design 
improvements with the knee implant systems.  Theref ore, like those subjects who participated in 
previous studies, data from this study will lead to results that will continue to improve the longevity of future knee implants. 
 
METHODS TO OBTAIN "INFORMED CONSENT" FROM PARTICIPANTS 
Once a patient is identified as potentially e ligible by the surgeon’s staff (TOC: Ms. Smith, JJ 
Campbell or Peggy Adams; Erlanger Orthopaedics - TBD), the patient’s KSS, clinical dictation, 
and EHR will be reviewed by the surgeon and he will approve or reject the patient as a candidate 
for the study. As indicated in the Recruitment sec tion of this protocol, in order to ensure and 
document compliance of eligibility, during review of  medical files, the research staff will utilize 
the CMR Recruitment/Enrollment ch ecklist to ensure that each potential subject meets all 
eligibility requirements prior to being contacted. This sheet includes a checklist of the inclusion 
criteria, as well as a field for research staff to include a subject identifier so the subject’s eligibility can once again be confirmed on the day of data collection. Once this sheet has been 
completed by the Research Foundation staff, it will be submitted to a UT Research Coordinator, 
lead researcher or PI/Co-PI/Sub-I to review a nd authorize recruitment and enrollment. After a 
potentially eligible subject has been identified and authorized to be enrolled in the study,
 the 
research staff will then contact the subject, and if  interested, the subject will be scheduled for a 
meeting with the research staff at their office.  After a thorough explana tion of the study and the 
activities that the subject will be doing, making sure the subject has asked all questions and 
received answers, if the subject agrees to participate, s/he will sign the Informed Consent and the 
HIPAA release. A research staff member will then schedule the fluoroscopic testing session 
during after-hours at the Tenness ee Orthopaedic Clinic. These c onsent forms will be securely 
transmitted and stored at the University of Te nnessee, as well as the Research Foundation and 
Erlanger Orthopaedics and w ill be accessible by only the aforementioned personnel.  
 Dr. Cates nor Dr. Freeman will be present during the consenting process to avoid possible subject coercion to participate. Subjects may c ontact their surgeon’s o ffice with any questions 
they may have.  From previous studies, we have determined that  it takes approximately 15 minutes to consent a 
subject and answer any questions that s/he may have. We have also estimated approximately 30 minutes for UT researchers to guide the subject through the step s of the procedure, allow the 
subject to practice the activities and then to actually pe rform the activities under fluoroscopic 
surveillance; actual radiation exposure will be up to, but not more than two minutes. Fluoroscopy 
on-time and any fluoroscopy unit measurements w ill be indicated on each subject’s IC/HIPAA 
form.

5/3/2019 Since study participants who are patients of Dr. Freeman will be traveling from the Chattanooga 
area to Knoxville for data collec tion, the sponsor of the study has allocated a $100.00 stipend for 
these individuals. This payment will be made th rough the University of Tennessee. Subjects will 
be asked to complete necessary paperwork during their consenting visit for them to receive this 
payment. An invoice will be created for each subj ect on the day that they complete their data 
collection and the payment will be processed thr ough the University’s system. It could take up to 
two weeks for payment to be received. Local su bjects of Dr. Cates did/will not receive this 
compensation as their travel is not as substantial.

Q: Do you know a source or Web site where I can find a listin g of 
typical whole-bod y doses for common nuclear medicine, 
radio graph y, CT, mammo, and fluoro exams? I'm just lookin g for 
average doses.
A: There are numerous sources for some of this information. While 
that is nice for those of us w ho know where to look, there really 
isn't one source of information on doses for all types of typical 
exams. I've put together, in th e tables below, some of the 
information you requested. I've also  included the references I used 
in the event you might want to go to  the library to look at them or 
to order a copy for yourself. Table 1 is a list of x-ray exams and 
I've given a single-film effective dose.

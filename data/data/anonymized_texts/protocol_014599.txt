 4 1. OBJECTIVES  
 
1.1 Primary Objectives  
 
To determine the disease control rate  (DCR)  at 4 months using Response Evaluation 
Criteria for Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.1 ) in subjects with previousl y treated unresectable or 
metastatic adenosquamous pancreatic or ampullary cancer  (ASQ)  treated with 
retifanlimab . 
 
1.2 Secondary Objectives  
 
1.2.1 To determine the objective response rate (ORR) using RECIST 1.1. 
1.2.2 To assess progression -free survival (PFS).  
1.2.3 To characterize the treatment -related adverse events attributable to retifanlimab . 
 1.3 Exploratory Objectives  
 
1.3.1 To assess overall survival (OS).  
1.3.2 To assess duration of response (DOR) and time to progression (TTP). 
1.3.3  To assess the DCR, ORR , PFS, and DOR by immune RECIST (iRECIST).  
1.3.4 To identify potential biomarker predictors of response versus resistance to retifanlimab  and autoimmune toxicity in plasma samples.  
1.3.5 To test for predictors of response and resistance and explore changes in the tumor microenvironment (TME) following retifanlimab  treatment in collected archived 
tissue and pre - and post -treatment biopsies via immunohistochemical studies.  
1.3.6 Measure tumo r marker kinetics (CA 19 -9) in subjects receiving treatment and 
correlate with OS, PFS, and best overall response. 
1.3.7 Measure tumor mutation burden, microsatellite instability, and profile genetic 
abnormalities in treated patients and correlate with res ponse and resistance to 
therapy.  
 1.4 Study Design 
 This is multi- center  two stage phase  2 study to evaluate the clinical activity  of retifanlimab  in 
patients with unresectable or metastatic ASQ. This study will enroll  subjects  who have progressed 
after at least 1 prior chemotherapy regimen , have been deemed unfit for cytotoxic chemotherapy 
or who have refused cytotoxic chemotherapy. The primary endpoint of this study will be  disease 
control rate (DCR) at 4 months following the start of treatment  using RECIST 1.1. Up to 25  
subjects will be enrolled  to target 21  evaluable patients.  
 The study will consist of a screening period (within 21 days of first dose), a treatment period per 
the table below  (Section 10) , and a follow -up period. Subjects will receive a baseline biopsy and 
then be treated with the anti -PD1 antibody retifanlimab  every 4 weeks. After 2 doses  (8 weeks ), 
subjects will be assessed for response with imaging and laboratory tests and receive anoth er 
research biopsy. For patients with stable disease or tumor response and clinical benefit , 
retifanlimab  will be continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients will be 
evaluated radiographically after every 2 doses of retifanlimab  (every 8 weeks) . Subjects will come 
J19106 /  Version 9.0/ July 20, 2022  
 5 to the clinic for dosing and assessments on Day 1 of each cycle. Assessment will  consist of 1) 
physician evaluation to assess symptoms of tumor response or progression and potential drug 
related toxicity, 2) cross sectio nal imaging (CT scans), 3)  CA19-9 blood levels. Additional visits  
for safety and immune monitoring follow -up will occur per the study calendar  in Section 10 . 
 No dose escalation s or reduction s are allowed. Enrollment  will continue until 21 subjects have 
received at least one dose of retifanlimab  and completed one cycle of therapy. The null hypothesis 
that the DCR 4 months following the start of treatment is 5% will be tested against a one -sided  
alternative  (DCR of 30%).  
 Complete unacceptable toxicity criteria can be found in Section 5.7 . At the investigator’s 
discretion, subjects may receive additional cycles of treatment if they are clinically stable and meet 
dosing eligibility criteria. All subjects may continue in the treatment period  until the criteria in 
Section 5.9 are met . Subjects may continue on treatment with radiographi c disease progression i f 
clinic ally stable and investigator believes the treatment is providing benefit. Subjects will be 
considered in the treatment  period until 28 days  after the last dose of study drug. 
 Patients who have a confirmed complete response by two scans ≥ 4 weeks apart and  who have 
been on retifanlimab treatment for at least 6 months may discontinue retifanlimab treatment at the discretion of the investigator after receiving at least two doses beyond the initial determination of CR.  Patients with SD, PR or CR that received  at least 24 months of retifanlimab may also 
discontinue retifanlimab at the discretion of the investigator.  Retifanlimab may be resumed upon 
disease recurrence or progression in these patients. Criteria and procedures for retreatment are 
described in Sect ions 5.9.2  and 10.0.  
 
After completion of treatment and end of treatment (EOT ) visit assessment s, all subjects , including 
those who did not receive treatment, will continue to be followed every three months ( ± 2 weeks) 
by telephone, e -mail, or optional clinic visit until death, withdrawal of consent, or closure of study.  
Subjects will also be contacted at 90 days (+14 day reporting window) from the last dose of 
therapy. Information on survival and new cancer therapies will be collected.  All subjects who 
discontinue study treatment should continue to be monitored for disease status by radiologic 
imaging  every two months ( ± 2 weeks)  until: 1) the start of a new antineoplastic therapy 
(information of the new cancer therapy will be collected), 2) di sease progression, 3 ) death , 4) 
withdrawal  of consent, or  5) the close of the study, whichever occurs first.  All subjects  will be 
followed after their last dose of study drug for the development of adverse events  (AEs ) and serious 
adverse events (SAEs) as described in Section 7.5 .  
 The primary analysis will be conducted 4 months after the last enrolled subject  begins treatment, 
or all patients have either come off study or have completed 4 months on study. Information on 
survival may continue to be gathered for supplementary analyses after the completion of the primary an alysis.

 6 2. BACKGROUND  
 
2.1 Study Disease  
 
Pancreatic cancer  is estimated to be the second leading cause of cancer -related death in the US by 
20301. It is one of the  deadliest cancer s – it has the lowest 5 year survival rate of all cancer  types 
with most patients being diagnosed with advanced disease with a  median survival less than 1 year2. 
In unresectable and metastatic patients standard regimens only include cytotoxic chemotherapy.  
As far as single agents – gemcitabine reports a median survival of 5.65 to 6.8  months and overall 
tumor response rates are 5.4 to 9.4%  3. To achieve reasonable response rates multiagent regimens 
are utilized . The FOLFIRINOX regimen utilizes a combination of oxaliplatin, irinoteca n, 
fluorouracil, and leucovorin. Response rate s are 31.6% and e stimated median OS is 11.1 months4. 
Another established combination regimen is nab-pacli taxel combined with gemcitabine with ORR 
of 23%  and median OS of 8.5 months5. As expected these multiagent cytotoxic regimens  cause 
significant toxicity and are often  reserved for the fittest pa tients.  This trial involves  a targeted 
approach to treating a subtype of pancreatic adenocarcinoma with the goal to  establish 
immunotherapy in this deadly disease . 
 
ASQ of the pancreas constitutes 1 to 5% of all pancreatic cancers and compared to pancreati c 
adenocarcinoma has a worse survival. ASQs have glandular and squamous histologic components 
(>30% squamous component for the diagnosis) and are considered a variant of pancreatic ductal 
adenocarcinomas. Given its rarity and aggressiveness, systemic thera py has not been well studied 
in ASQ and in practice a cytotoxic chemotherapy treatment paradigm is pursued in advanced 
disease with overall poor outcomes6. In addition, there is no data regarding the efficacy of immune 
checkpoint inhibition in ASQ pancreatic cancer, and most clinical trials have excluded them from 
eligibility.  
 
2.2 Rationale 
 
Immunotherapies in Pancreatic Cancer  
 
Pancreatic  ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC)  is considered an immune quiescent tumor and single 
agent checkpoint blockade has had an overall disappointing impact on survival (including targeting 
PD-1, PD -L1 and CTLA -4)7–9. Immunotherapeutic approaches have shown some ability to 
“reprogram” the immune tumor microenvironment (TME) within pancreatic tumors10–12. Several 
studies have also described the clinical and prognostic significance of PD -L1 expression in 
pancreatic cancer including higher expression levels predicting a poor pro gnosis further suggesting 
the immune TME influences pancreatic tumor behavior13–15. In an effort to identify patient 
subgroups most likely to respond to immunotherapy, the immun e TME in the rare pancreas cancer 
histological subtype - adenosquamous carcinoma (ASQ)  was evaluated by our team . Indeed a 
recent article reported high PD -L1 expression in a series of ASQ cases (5 of 6 surgical cases)16.

SUMMARY  DESCRIPTION  
Agent  Premedications; Precautions  Dose  Route  Cycle  Length  
Retifanlimab  No prophylactic 
pre-medication will be given 
unless indicated by previous 
experience in an individual 
subject  per Section 5. 2. 500 mg IV infusion 
over 30 
minutes* 28 days 
*Infusion times are approximate ( -5/ +15  min) and may need to be adjusted based on subject 
tolerability . 
 

J19106 /  Version 9.0/ July 20, 2022  
 13 5.2 General Concomitant Medication and Supportive Care Guidelines  
 
Retifanlimab  is a fully human monoclonal immunoglobulin (Ig) G44κ  antibody. S ubjects should 
be closely monitored for potential AEs  during antibody infusion and potential AEs throughout the 
study.  
 
5.2.1 Infusion Reactions  
Infusion or hypersensitivity reactions may be observed with administration of any foreign protein.  Premedication with  acetaminophen/paracetamol and a histamine blocker should be considered for 
participants who have had previous systemic reactions to protein product infusions or when recommended by institutional policy.  Guidelines for management of suspected infusion reactions are provided in Table 1 . 
J19106 /  Version 9.0/ July 20, 2022  
 14 Table  1: Guidelines for Management of Suspected Infusion Reactions 
 
Grade  Descriptiona) Treatment  Subsequent Infusions  
1 Mild reaction; infusion interruption not indicated; 
intervention not indicated.  Monitor vital signs closely until medically stable.  Premedication with acetaminophen/paracetamol and a 
histamine blocker should be considered for participants 
who have had previous systemic reactions to protein 
product infusions or when recommended by institutional 
policy.  
2 Requires infusion interruption but responds promptly to 
symptomatic treatment ( e.g., antihistamines, NSAIDS, 
narcotics, IV fluids); prophylactic medications indicated 
for ≤  24 hours.  First o ccurrence:   Stop infusion and initiate appropriate 
medical measures ( e.g., IV fluids, antihistamines 
NSAIDS, acetaminophen/paracetamol, narcotics, per institutional preferences).  
Monitor vital signs until medically stable.  
If symptoms resolve within 1  hour, infusion may be 
resumed at 50% of the original infusion rate.  
Subsequent occurrences (after recommended prophylaxis):  Permanently discontinue study treatment.  Premedicate at least 30  minutes before infusion with 
antihistamines ( e.g., diphenhydramine 50 mg PO) and 
acetaminophen/  
paracetamol (500-1000 mg PO).  
Additional supportive measures may be acceptable (per 
institutional preference) but should be discussed with 
medical monitor.  
Next infusion should start at 50% of the original infusion 
rate.  If no re action, rate of infusion can be increase by 
25% every 15 minutes until a rate of 100% has been 
reached.  Subsequent infusions can begin at 100%.  
3 or 4  Grade 3:   Prolonged ( i.e., not rapidly responsive to 
symptomatic medication and/or brief interruption of infusion); recurrence of symptoms following initial 
improvement; hospitalization indicated for other clinical 
sequelae ( e.g., renal impairment, pulmonary infiltrates).  
Grade 4:   Life-threatening; pressor or ventilatory 
support indicated.  Stop infusion and initiate appropriate medical therapy 
(e.g., IV fluids, antihistamines NSAIDS, acetaminophen/  
paracetamol, narcotics, oxygen, pressors, epinephrine, 
corticosteroids, per institutional preferences).  
Monitor vital signs frequently until medically stable.  Hospitalization may be indicated.  Permanently discontinue study treatment.  
a) Per NCI CTCAE v5.0, appropriate resusci tation equipment should be available at the bedside and a physician readily available during the period of study treatment administration.

Please refer to Section 6. 2 for guidelines to manage treatment delays due to  retifanlimab  infusion-
related reactions.  
 5.2.2 R etifanlimab  Related Adverse Events  
 
Blocking PD-1 function may permit the emergence of auto -reactive T cells and resultant clinical 
autoimmunity. Rash/ pruritus , diarrhea/colitis, pneumonitis, hepatitis , and hypothyroidism  were 
drug- related, presumptive autoimmune events noted in previous anti -PD1 studies .  
 
For the purposes of this study, a  retifanlimab -related  AE is defined as an AE of unknown etiology, 
associated with drug exposure and is consistent with an immune phenomenon. Efforts should be made to rule out neoplastic, infectious, metabolic, toxin or other etiologic causes. Serological, immunological, and h istological (biopsy) data should be used to support the diagnosis of an 
immune -mediated toxicity. Suspected retifanlimab -related AEs must be documented on an AE or 
SAE CRF.  Identification  and treatment of retifanlimab -related AEs can be found in NCCN’s 
guidelines for the management of immunotherapy- related toxicities.  Additional guidance can be 
found in the Retifanlimab  Investigator ’s Brochure s (IB).  
 5.3 Prohibited and/or Restricted Medications and Devices  
 The following therapies or devices are not permit ted during the treatment period (if administered, 
the subject may be removed from the study):  
 
• Immunosuppressive agents unless they are utilized to treat an AE or as specified in 
Sections 5.2 and 5.6. 
• Any non- study anticancer chemotherapy or immunotherapy (approved or 
investigational)  with the exception of subjects in the survival period of the study, with 
the exception of hormonal therapy in the setting of a second, hormone -sensitive 
malignancy not thought to have impact on longevity (i.e . prostate cancer, early stage 
breast cancer)  
• Any major surgery or surgical procedure; if required must be discussed with the IND Sponsor  to determine if it is appropriate for the subject to continue study treatment  
• Another investigational agent  
• Live vaccines (examples of live vaccines include, but are not limited to: measles, mumps, rubella, chicken pox, yellow fever, rabies, BCG, and typhoid [oral] vaccine). Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally killed virus vaccines and are allowed. However , intranasal influenza vaccines (e.g. Flu- Mist
®) are live attenuated 
vaccines, and are not allowed.  
•  Palliative (limited -field) radiation therapy is permitted, but only for pain control and 
with approval by the IND Sponsor. 
• Systemically active steroids can be used but should be reported to the IND Sponsor. Steroid treatment should be completed at least 14 days prior to resuming study -related 
treatments.  Patients requiring adrenal replacement steroid doses <  10 mg daily 
prednisone equivalent (in the absence of active autoimmune disease) may resume treatment if approved by the IND Sponsor .  
• Use of growth factors unless prior discussion and agreement with the  IND Sponsor. 
• Use of allergen hyposensitization therapy  
J19106 /  Version 9.0/ July 20, 2022  
 16  
 5.4 Other Restrictions and Precautions 
 Palliative (limited -field) radiation therapy is permitted, but only for pain control to sites present at 
baseline and with approval by the IND Sponsor . 
 Medical marijuana for pain or symptom control will be perm itted.  
 5.5 Definition of an Overdose for this Protocol  
 
Overdose of retifanlimab  is defined as:  
An overdose is defined as the accidental or intentional administration of any dose of a product that is considered both excessive and medically important. All occurrences of overdose must be 
reported as SAEs (see Section 7.5.1  for reporting details).  Appropriate  supportive treatment should 
be provided if clinically indicated.  
 All reports of overdose with and without an AE  must be reported within 24 hours to the IND 
Sponsor and Incyte. Incyte contact information can be found in Section 7.5.1. 
5.6 Unacceptable T oxicity  
 Toxicities are defined in the Investigator’s Brochure and Table 4 . Unacceptable toxicities for 
this protocol that will trigger additional review described below are defined as:  
 
1. Any treatment- related >  grade 3 AEs .  Exceptions include:  
 
• Asymptomatic laboratory abnormalities  (AST, ALT, and bilirubin abnormalities requiring 
discontinuation as per Table 4  will be considered unacceptable toxicity)  
• Grade 3 fatigue  
• Grade 3 dermatologic AEs that are considered mild in severity but only considered grade 
3 because of >30% body surface involvement  including pruritus    
• Diarrhea, nausea, or vomiting that resolves to < grade 3 within 48 hours of maximal 
intervention  
• Grade 3 -4 hyperglycemia or grade 3 endocrinopathies where symptoms are controlled on 
hormone replacement therapy  
 2. Treatment related b lood bilirubin > 5 x ULN or concurrent blood bilirubin > 2 x ULN and AST 
or ALT > 3 x ULN  
 
3. Treatment related eye pain ≥ grade 2 or reduction of visual acuity that does not respond to topical therapy and does not improve to ≤ grade 1 severity within 2 weeks of starting therapy, 
or requires systemic therapy is an unacceptable toxicity.  
 
Unexpected Grade 3 or greater laboratory abnormalities should be repeated within 24- 72 hours if 
clinically indicated and monitored as necessary to determine if event meet s toxicity criteria.   
 
J19106 /  Version 9.0/ July 20, 2022  
 17 The proportion of treated subjects with unacceptable toxicity will be monitored using a Bayesian 
stopping guideline.  A Beta (1.5, 5.5) prior, representing a toxicity rate of 21%, a slightly conservative estimate, was used in the dev elopment of our guidelines.  We will halt the accrual 
and re -evaluate the safety  if the posterior probability that the toxicity rate exceeds the 33% 
boundary is greater than 60%.  Toxicity will be monitored continuously. Table 2 summarizes the 
stopping boundaries for unacceptable toxicities.

 5.7 WOCBP, Contraception, Use in Pregnancy, Use in Nursing  
 A WOCBP is defined as any female who has experienced menarche and who has not undergone surgical sterilization (hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy) and is not postmenopausal. Menopause is defined  clinically  as 12 months of amenorrhea in a woman over age 45 years in the 
absence of other biological or physiological causes. In addition, women under the age of 62 years must have a documented serum follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level >  40mIU/mL to confirm 
menopause.  
 
J19106 /  Version 9.0/ July 20, 2022  
 18 Women treated with hormone replacement therapy (HRT) are likely to have artificially suppressed 
FSH levels and may require a washout period in order to obtain a physiologic FSH level. The duration of the washout period is a function of the type of HRT used. The duration of the washout period below are suggested guidelines and the investigators should use their judgment in checking serum FSH levels. If the serum FSH level is >40 mIU/ml at any time during the washout period, the woman can be considered postmenopausal:  
 
• 1 week minimum for vaginal hormonal products (rings, creams, gels)  
• 4 week minimum for transdermal products  
• 8 week minimum for oral products  
 
5.7.1 Contraception  
 One of the highly effective methods of contraception listed below is required during study duration and until the end of relevant systemic exposure, defined as 6 months  after the end 
of study treatment. * 
 
Highly Effective Contraceptive Methods That Are User Dependent  
Failure rate of <1% per year when used consistently and correctly.a  
• Combined (estrogen - and progestogen -containing) hormonal contraception associated with 
inhibition of ovulationb  
− oral  
− intravaginal  
− transdermal  
• Progestogen -only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulationb  
− oral  
− injectable  
Highly Effective  Methods That Are User Independent   
• Implantable progestogen -only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of 
ovulation b 
• Hormonal methods of contraception including oral contraceptive pills containing a 
combination of estrogen and progesterone, vaginal ring, injectables, implants an d 
intrauterine hormone -releasing system (IUS)c 
• Intrauterine device (IUD)c 
• Bilateral tubal occlusion  
• Vasectomized partner  
A vasectomized partner is a highly effective contraception method provided that the partner is the 
sole male sexual partner of the WOCBP and the absence of sperm has been confirmed. If not, an additional highly effective method of contraception should be used. 
 
J19106 /  Version 9.0/ July 20, 2022  
 19 • Sexual abstinence  
Sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if defined as refraining from 
heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the study drug. The 
reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the duration of the study and the 
preferred and usual lifestyle of the participant.  
• It is no t necessary to use any other method of contraception when complete abstinence is 
elected.  
• WOCBP participants who choose complete abstinence must continue to have pregnancy 
tests, as specified in Section 10.  
• Acceptable alternate methods of highly effectiv e contraception must be discussed in the 
event that the WOCBP participants chooses to forego complete abstinence  
NOTES:  
a Typical use failure rates may differ from those when used consistently and correctly. Use should be 
consistent with local regulatio ns regarding the use of contraceptive methods for participants 
participating in clinical studies.  
b Hormonal contraception may be susceptible to interaction with the study drug, which may reduce the 
efficacy of the contraceptive method.  Hormonal contrace ption is permissible only when there is 
sufficient evidence that the IMP and other study medications will not alter hormonal exposures such 
that contraception would be ineffective or result in increased exposures that could be potentially 
hazardous.  In this case, alternative methods of contraception should be utilized.  
c Intrauterine devices and intrauterine hormone releasing systems are acceptable methods of 
contraception in the absence of definitive drug interaction studies when hormone exposures from 
intrauterine devices do not alter contraception effectiveness  
 
Unacceptable Methods of Contraception*  
• Male or female condom with or without spermicide.  Male and female condoms cannot be 
used simultaneously  
• Diaphragm with spermicide  
• Cervical cap with spermicide  
• Vaginal Sponge with spermicide  
• Progestogen -only oral hormonal contraception, where inhibition of ovulation is not the 
primary mechanism of action  
• Periodic abstinence (calendar, symptothermal, post -ovulation methods)  
• Withdrawal (coitus interruptu s). 
• Spermicide only 
• Lactation amenorrhea method (LAM)  
 
* Local laws and regulations may require use of alternative and/or additional 
contraception methods.  
J19106 /  Version 9.0/ July 20, 2022  
 20  
CONTRACEPTION GUIDANCE FOR MALE PARTICIPANTS WITH 
PARTNER(S) OF CHILD BEARING POTENTIAL.  
 Male participants with female partners of childbearing potential are eligible to participate 
if they agree to the following during the treatment and until the end of relevant systemic exposure.  
• Inform any and all partner(s) of their participation in a clinical drug study and the need to comply with contraception instructions as directed by the investigator.  
• Male participants are required to use a condom for study duration and until end of relevant systemic exposure defined as 6 months  after the end of study trea tment.  
• Female partners of males participating in the study to consider use of effective methods 
of contraception until the end of relevant systemic exposure, defined as 6 months after 
the end of treatment in the male participant.  
• Male participants with a p regnant or breastfeeding partner must agree to remain 
abstinent from penile vaginal intercourse or use a male condom during each episode of 
penile penetration during the treatment and until 6 months  after the end of study 
treatment.  
• Refrain from donating sperm for the duration of the study treatment and until 6 months 
after the end of study treatment.  
 5.7.2 Use in Pregnancy  
 The investigational agents used in this protocol  may have adverse effects on a fetus; 
therefore, women with a positive pregnancy test at screening will not be eligible for enrollment.  If a subject  inadvertently becomes pregnant while on treatment, the subject  
will immediately be removed from the study.  The site will contact the subject  at least 
monthly and document the subject ’s status until the pregnancy has been completed or 
terminated.   
 Pregnancy in female subjects or in partners of male subjects throughout the study or within 
6 months  of completing treatment  should be reported initially as a serious adverse event 
(see reporting procedures in S ection 7.5.6) by the investigator within 24 hours of learning 
of its occurrence. Pregnancy information must be re ported on the Pregnancy Form . 
 Protocol required procedures for study discontinuation and follow -up must be performed 
on the subject unless contraindicated by pregnancy (e .g., x -ray studies). Other appropriate 
pregnancy follow -up procedures should be consi dered if indicated.   
 Follow -up information regarding the course of the pregnancy, including any voluntary or 
spontaneous termination, perinatal and neonatal outcome and where applicable, offspring information must be reported on the Pregnancy Follow -up Form. Pregnancy outcomes 
must also be collected for the female partners of any males in this trial. Consent to report information regarding these pregnancy outcomes should be obtained from the female partner.  
  
J19106 /  Version 9.0/ July 20, 2022  
 21 5.7.3 Use in Nursing Women  
 
Since many drugs are excreted in human milk, and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in the nursing infant, subjects  who are breast -feeding are not eligible for 
enrollment.  
 5.7.4 All Subjects (Male and Female)  
 All sexually active patients must use at least a barrier method (i.e., condom) to prevent transmission of body fluids.  
 5.8 Duration of Therapy  
 Subjects who are clinically stable and meet dosing requirements (per Section 6. 2) may continue 
to receive treatment  until  the criteria in Section 5.9 are met .  
 5.9 Criteria for Removal from Treatment  
 The reason for study removal and the date the subject  was removed will be documented in the 
CRF .  
A subject will be discontinued from the trial for any of the following reasons:  
• The subject or legal representative (such as a parent or legal guardian) withdraws consent  for participation in the study . 
 
A subject must be discontinued from treatment (but may continue to be monitored in the post -
treatment follow -up portion of the trial) for any of the following reasons:  
 
• The subject or legal repre sentative (such as a parent or legal guardian) withdraws 
consent for treatment , 
•  Intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of treatment,  
•  Unacceptable toxicity  (see Section 5.6). Exceptions for treatment discontinuation are 
listed in Section 5.6,  
•  Disease progression as defined in Section 5.9.1,  
•  Severe or life -threatening retifanlimab -related AE(s)  (see Sec tion 6.2), 
•  Need for >2 dose delays due to the same drug -related toxicity as per the dose delay 
guidelines (see Section 6.2) , 
•  If, in the opinion of the Investigator, a change or temporal or permanent discontinuation 
of therapy would be in the best interest of the subject , 
•  Noncompliance with trial treatment or procedure requirements,  
•  Subject is lost to follow -up, or  
• Subject becomes pregnant . 
   
J19106 /  Version 9.0/ July 20, 2022  
 22 A subject  may, at the discretion of the I nvestigator , be discontinued from treatment (but may 
continue to be monitored in the post -treatment follow -up portion of the trial) if they have : 
 
• Completed 6 months of treatment with retifanlimab and has a complete response (CR) 
by at least two scans ≥  4 weeks apart AND have received at least two doses of 
retifanlimab beyond the initial determination of CR.  
• Completed 24 months of treatment with  retifanlimab and has a response of stable 
disease, partial response, or complete response at the time of discontinuation 
 Note: time on treatment is calculated from the date of first dose.  
 
5.9.1 Disease Progression  
 Retifanlimab  is expected to trigger immune -mediated responses, which require activation 
of the immune system prior to the observation of clinical responses. Such immune activation may take weeks to months to be evident. Some subjects  may have objective 
volume increase of  tumor lesions or other disease parameters within weeks following the 
start of immunotherapy. Such subjects  may not have had sufficient time to develop the 
required immune activation or, in some subjects , tumor volume or other disease parameter 
increases m ay represent infiltration of lymphocytes into the original tumor. In conventional 
studies, such tumor volume or relevant laboratory parameter increases during the first 2 -4 
months of the study would constitute disease progression  and lead to discontinuation of 
imaging to detect response, thus disregarding the potential for subsequent immune -
mediated clinical response.  
 
Subjects will be permitted to continue with treatment beyond initial RECIST 1.1 defined 
PD as long as they meet the following criteria:  
• Investigator -assesse s that the patient is not clinically deteriorating , and  
• Subject is tolerating study drug.  
 
The assessment of lack of deterioration  should take into account whether the subject is 
clinically stable or if they unlikely to receive further benefit from continued treatment. The following criteria need to be taken into consideration:  
• No significant decline in ECOG performance status.  
• Absence of rapid progression of disease or of progressive tumor at critical anatomical sites (e.g., cor d compression) requiring urgent alternative medical intervention.  
 All decisions to continue treatment beyond PD must be discussed with the IND Sponsor  
and documented in the study records.  Tumor assessments will be made using RECIST 1.1 ( Appendix B) and i RECIST  
(Appendix C ).  
 5.9.2 Retreatment with Retifanlimab   Patients who stop retifanlimab with SD or better may be eligible for resume therapy if they 
progress after stopping retifanlimab  and they meet  the following criteria:  
J19106 /  Version 9.0/ July 20, 2022  
 23  
EITHER  
• Stopped initial treatment with retifanlimab after attaining an investigator determined confirmed CR according to RECIST 1.1, w as treated for at least 6 
months  with retifanlimab, and r eceived at least two doses of retifanlimab  beyond 
the date when the initial CR was declared . 
 OR 
• Subject had SD, PR or CR and stopped retifanlimab  treatment after 24 months of  
study drug for reasons other than disease progression or intolerability  
 AND  
• Experienced an investigator -determined confirmed radiographic  or clinical  disease  
progression after stopping their initial treatment with retifanlimab  
• Did not receive any anti -cancer treatment since the last dose of retifanlimab  
• Have an ECOG performance status of 0 -2 
• Female subject of childbearing potential should have a negative urine or serum  
pregnancy test within 3 days  prior to receiving retreatment with study medication.  
• Female subjects of childbearing potential should be willing to follow instructions for method(s) of contraception or abstain from heterosexual activity for the  course 
of the study through 6 months  after the last dose of study drug. 
• Male subjects should agree to use an adequate method of contraception starting  
with the first dose of study therapy through 6 months  after the last dose of study  
therapy.  
• Does not have a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory  
abnormality that might interfere with the subject’s participation for the full duration  
of the trial or is not in the best interest of the subject to participate, in the opinion  
of the treating investigator.  
 Subjects who restart treatment shoul d resume at the next cycle which  they would have  
receiv ed prior to discontinuation. Study visit requirements are outlined in  the Study 
Calendar (Section 10.0).  
 
5.10 End of Treatment (EOT) Visit  
 All subject s will return to the study site  28 days  (± 7 days)  after the final study treatment for an 
EOT evaluation. Procedures and assessments performed at these visits and beyond should follow 
the respective guidelines described in Sections 5.1 1 and 10.0 as appropriate.   
 If the EOT visit occurs early (e.g., 1 week prior to the expect ed visit as protocol allows) or 
if the 
patient cannot return due to disease progression , an assessment for AEs should be made by telephone 
or email on day 28 (± 1 day) after last dose of study drug and documented.  
 For subjects who discontinue study drug after 24 months of SD or better or with a CR af ter 6 
months (see Section 5.9.2) , the EOT visit should be completed as described above .  If a patient 
later restarts study drug, they should have a second  EOT visit performe d when they eventually 
discontinue study drug for a second time . 
 
J19106 /  Version 9.0/ July 20, 2022  
 24 5.11 Duration of Follow -Up 
 
5.12.1 Safety Follow -up 
 
Subjects who discontinue treatment should be contacted by telephone or email at 90 days 
(+14 day reporting window) from their last dose of study drug or within 7 days before 
initiation of a new antineoplastic treatment (whichever comes first) to assess for treatment 
related toxicities. In addition, all SAEs occurring during this time should be reported as well.  
 Subjects who are discontinued from the study treatment due to an unacceptable drug-related AE will be monitored for safety until the resolution of the AE to ≤ grade 1 or stabilization or until initiation of a new therapy for their cancer, whichever occurs first.  
 5.12.2 Clinical Fol low-up 
 Subjects who discontinue treatment without disease progression should continue to be monitored for disease status by radiologic imaging. Disease monitoring should continue to be assessed every two months (± 2 weeks) for the first 2 years and then every 3 m onths (±  
4 weeks)  until: 1) start of a new antineoplastic therapy (information of the new cancer 
therapy will be collected), 2) disease progression, 3) death, 4) withdrawal of consent, or 5) study closure, whichever occurs first.  
 5.12.3 Survival Follow -up  
 
Subjects who discontinue treatment and have disease progression will enter the survival 
follow -up portion of the trial. Subjects  should be contacted every 12 weeks ( ± 2 weeks) to 
monitor overall survival. Information of other cancer therapies after discontinuation from the study treatment will be collected as well.  
  
 6. DOSE MODIFICATION, DELAYS AND TOXICITY MANAGEMENT GUIDELINES 
FOR IMMUNE- RELATED AES  
 6.1  Dose Modi fications  
 
Subjects will be monitored continuously for AEs while on study drug. Subjects will be instructed to notify their physician immediately for any and all AEs. Dose escalations or reductions of retifanlimab  will not be allowed.  
 6.2  Dose Delays  and Discontinuation  
 Adverse events of a potential immunologic etiology, or irAEs, may be defined as AEs of unknown etiology, associated with drug exposure and consistent with an immune phenomenon.  Immune -
related AEs may be predicted based on the n ature of the compounds, their mechanism of action, 
and reported experience with immunotherapies that have a similar mechanism of action.  Special attention should be paid to AEs that may be suggestive of potential irAEs. An irAE can occur shortly after the  first dose or several months after the last dose of treatment.  If an irAE is suspected, 
J19106 /  Version 9.0/ July 20, 2022  
 25 efforts should be made to rule out neoplastic, infectious, metabolic, toxin or other etiologic causes 
before labeling an AE as an irAE.  Recommendations for management  of specific immune -mediated AEs known to be associated 
with other PD -1 inhibitors ( e.g., pembrolizumab, nivolumab) are detailed in Table 4  (below).  
Algorithms for evaluation of selected immune toxicities that have previously been attributed to PD-1 inhibitors and management guidelines for irAEs not detailed elsewhere in the Protocol 
should follow the ASCO or ESMO Clinical Practice Guidelines (Brahmer et al 2018, Haanen et al 2017).

 28 7. ADVERSE EVENTS:  LIST AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS  
 
This study will use the descriptions and grading scales found in the revised CTCAE version 5.0 
for AE  reporting that can be found at  
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm .   
 Information about all AEs, whether volunteer ed by the subject, discovered by investigator 
questioning, or detected through physical examination, laboratory test or other means, will be collected, recorded, and followed as appropriate.   7.1 Definitions  
 
7.1.1 Adverse Event   An AE  is defined as any undesirable sign, symptom or medical condition occurring after 
starting the study drug (or therapy) even if the event is not considered to be related to the study. An undesirable medical condition can be symptoms (e.g., nausea, chest pai n), signs 
(e.g., tachycardia, enlarged liver) or the abnormal results of an investigation (e.g. , 
laboratory findings, electrocardiogram). Medical conditions/diseases present before starting the study treatment are only considered AEs if they worsen after s tarting the study 
treatment (any procedures specified in the protocol). New medical conditions / diseases occurring before starting the study treatment but after signing the informed consent form will not be recorded  as AEs . Additionally, expected progression of the disease being 
studied will not be recorded as an adverse event .  
 
Laboratory abnormalities:  Laboratory abnormalities present at the screening visit will 
be recorded as pre -treatment signs and symptoms. After study treatment administration, all 
grade 3 and 4 clinical laboratory results that represent an increase in severity from baseline will be reported as AEs. A grade 1 or 2 clinical laboratory abnormality should be reported as an AE only if it is considered clinically significant by the investigator ( induce clinical 
signs or symptoms or require therapy) , meets the definition of an SAE, or requi res the 
participant to have study drug discontinued or interrupted..  
 
7.1.2 Serious Adverse Event  
 
A SAE  is an undesirable sign, symptom or medical condition which:  
• Results in death  
• Is life threatening (defined as an event in which the subject was at ri sk of death at 
the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe)  
• Requires inpatient hospitalization or causes prolongation of existing hospitalization (see note below for exceptions) for >24 hours  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect (note: reports of congenital anomalies/birth 
defects must also be reported on the Pregnancy Form)  
• Is an important medical event (defined as a medical event(s) that may not be immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospitalization but, based upon 
J19106 /  Version 9.0/ July 20, 2022  
 29 appropriate medical and scientific judgment, may jeopardize the subject or may 
require intervention [e .g., medical, surgical] to prevent one of the other serious 
outcomes listed in the definition above.) Examples of such events include, but are not limited to, intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic 
bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization.)  
• Potential drug induced liver injury (DILI) is also considered an important medical event.  
• Is a new cancer (that is not a condition of the study)  
• Is associated with an overdose  
• Is a pregnancy  or pregnancy outcome of spontaneous abortion, missed abortion, 
benign hydatidiform mole, blighted ovum, fetal death, intrauterine death, miscarriage, or stillbirth.  
 
Events not considered to be SAEs are hospitalizations for:  
• Admissions as per protocol for a planned medical/surgical procedure or to facilitate a procedu re 
• Routine health assessment requiring admission for baseline/trending of health status (e.g., routine colonoscopy)  
• Medical/surgical admission for purpose other than remedying ill health state and was planned prior to entry into the study. Appropriate documentation is required in these cases.  
• Admission encountered for another life circumstance that carries no bearing on health status and requires no medical/surgical intervention (e .g., lack of housing, 
economic inadequacy, care -giver respite, family circumstances, administrative).  
• Admissions for monitoring of treatment- related infusion reactions that do not 
otherwise meet the criteria for a SAE.  
 7.2 Assessment of Causality  
 The relationship of an AE to the administration of the study drug i s to be assessed by the 
investigator according to the following definitions:  
 
• No (unrelated, not related, no relation) :  The time course between the administration of 
study drug and the occurrence or worsening of the adverse event rules out a causal 
relationship and another cause (concomitant drugs, therapies, complications, etc.) is suspected.  
 
• Yes (related) : The time course between the administration of study drug and the occurrence 
or worsening of the adverse event is consistent with a causal relationship and no other cause (concomitant drugs, therapies, complications, etc.) can be identified.  
 
The following factors sho uld also be considered:  
• The temporal sequence from study drug administration -  The event should occur after the 
study drug is given. The length of time from study drug exposure to event should be evaluated in the clinical context of the event.  
J19106 /  Version 9.0/ July 20, 2022  
 30 • Underlying, concomitant, intercurrent diseases - Each report should be evaluated in the 
context of the natural history and course of the disease being treated and any other disease 
the subject may have.  
• Concomitant medication -  The other medications the subject is taking or the treatment the 
subject receives should be examined to determine whether any of them might be recognized to cause the event in question.  
• Known response pattern for this class of study drug -  Clinical and/or preclinical data may 
indicate whethe r a particular response is likely to be a class effect.  
• Exposure to physical and/or mental stresses -  The exposure to stress might induce adverse 
changes in the recipient and provide a logical and better explanation for the event.  
• The pharmacology and pharmacokinetics of the study drug - The known pharmacologic 
properties (absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion) of the study drug should be considered.  
 
Assessment of Grade:  
 The investigator will make an assessment of grade for each AE and SAE reported during the study, which will be recorded in the CRF. The assessment will be based on the National Cancer Institute’s CTCAE (Version 5.0) and graded as shown below:  
• Grade 1: Mild ; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; 
intervention not indicated 
• Grade 2: Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age -
appropriate instrumental activities of daily living  
• Grade 3: Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; 
hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; limiting self- care 
activities of daily living  
• Grade 4: Life -threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated  
• Grad e 5: Death related to AE  
 Any AE that changes in grade during its course will be recorded in the CRF at the highest level experienced by the subject.  
 
7.3 Expectedness 
 
Unexpected AE: An AE, which varies in nature, intensity or frequency from information on the 
investigational drug/agent provided in the  product  IB, package insert or safety reports. Any AE 
that is not included in the IB, package insert, safety reports or informed consent is considered 
“unexpected”. An expected A E with a fatal ou tcome should be considered unexpected unless the 
IB specifically states that the A E might be associated with a fatal outcome . 
 
Expected (known) AE: An AE, which has been reported in the IB , package insert or safety reports . 
An AE  is considered “expected”, only if it is included in the IB document as a risk.  
 7.4  Handling of Expedited Safety Reports  
 In accordance with local regulations, the IND Sponsor (or designee) and Incyte  will notify 
J19106 /  Version 9.0/ July 20, 2022  
 31 investigators of all SAEs that are unexpected (i.e., not previously described in the IB), and related 
to retifanlimab . An event meeting these criteria is termed a Suspected, Unexpected Serious 
Adverse Reaction (SUSAR). Investigator notification of these events will be in the form of a 
SUSAR Repor t that is to be e -mailed to the investigators and the study coordinators. Upon 
receiving such notices, the investigator must review and retain the notice with the IB and where 
required by local regulations, the investigator will submit the SUSAR to the app ropriate IRB. The 
investigator and IRB will determine if the informed consent requires revision. The investigator 
should also comply with the IRB procedures for reporting any other safety information. 
 
7.5 Reporting  
 
7.5.1  Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
 
All AEs (both related and unrelated) will be captured on the appropriate study -specific 
CRFs. All AEs experienced by subjects will be collected and reported from the first dose 
of the investigational agent, throughout the study, and will be followed for 28 days after 
last dose of study drug unless related to the investigational agent.   
 
Subjects who experience a grade 2 or higher retifanlimab -related AE should be discussed 
with the IND Sponsor.  
 
Report AEs to the IND Sponso r within 24 hours once identified as an unacceptable 
toxicity (defined in Section 5. 6).   
 
Nilofer Azad : 
 
All adverse event information is reported to Incyte on the Principal 
Investigator’s/Institution’s Adverse Event Report Form, or a CIOMS -I or MedWatch Form 
FDA 3500A, or on an Adverse Event Report Form which may be provided by Incyte upon 
request. The Principal Investigator does not provide medical records (e.g., discharge 
summary) to Incyte, unless specifically requested  
 
All SAEs (including deaths) occur ring from the first dose of the study drug  through 9 0 
days (+ 14 day reporting window) after the last dose of retifanlimab  or within 7 days prior 
to initiation of a new antineoplastic treatment (whichever  comes first) will be collected and 
reported. All SAEs (including deaths) that the investigator considers related to study drug 
occurring after the follow -up period must be reported.  
 
Subjects who have an ongoing AE/SAE related to the study procedures and/or 
medication(s) may continue to be periodically contacted by a member of the study staff 
until the event is resolved or determined to be irreversible by the investigator.  
 
All SAEs will be report ed promptly to the IND Sponsor and Incyte within 24 hours 
of initial notification of the SAE  using the form found in Appendix D . SAE reports 
should be for a single subject. SAE forms should be sent with a cover sheet and any 
additional attachments.  Medical  records (e.g., discharge summary) should not be provided 
to Incyte, unless specifically requested.  If this falls on a weekend or holiday, an email 

J19106 /  Version 9.0/ July 20, 2022  
 32 notification is acceptable but must be followed by an SAE reporting form on the next 
business day.  
 
SAE repo rts and any other relevant safety information are to be sent to:  
 
Nilofer Azad : 
Incyte:   
 
7.5.2 Follow- up of Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
 
After the initial AE or SAE report, the investigator is required to proactively follow each 
subject and provide further information to the safety department in regards to the subject’s 
condition. 
 
All AE(s) and SAE(s) will be followed until:  
• Resolution 
• The condition stabilizes  
• The event is otherwise explained 
• The subject is lost to follow-up 
• Death  
 
As soon as relevant information is available, a follow -up SAE report will be submitted to 
the IND Sponsor and Incyte (per Section 7.5.9 ). 
 
7.5.3 Reconciliation of SAEs 
 
The IND Sponsor (or designee)  will reconcile the clinical database SAE cases (case level 
only) transmitted to the IND Sponsor  and Incyte. Frequency of reconciliation should be 
approximately every 3 months and prior to the database lock or final data summary.  Incyte 
will email, upon request from the Investigator, the reconciliation report. Requests for 
reconciliation should be sent to . The data elements listed on 
the Incyte reconciliation report will be used for case identification purposes. If the Sponsor 
determines a case was not transmitted to the IND Sponsor and Incyte , the case should be 
sent immediately to the IND Sponsor and Incyte. 
 
7.5.4 Overdose  
 
An overdose is def ined as the accidental or intentional administration of any dose of a 
product that is considered both excessive and medically important. All occurrences of 
overdose must be reported as SAEs.  
 
7.5.5 Potential Drug Induced Liver Injury (DILI)  
 
Wherever  possible,  timel y confirmation  of initial  liver-related  laboratory  abnormalities  
should occur prior to the reporting of a  potential DILI event.  All occurrences of potential 
DILIs, meeting the defined criteria, must be repo rted as SAEs  under the seriousness 
category checked as ‘other medically important e vent’. Potential drug induced liver injury  

J19106 /  Version 9.0/ July 20, 2022  
 33 is defined as:  
 
1) ALT or AST elevation > 3 times upper limit of normal (ULN)  
AND  
2) Total  bilirubin  > 2 times  ULN,  without initial  findings of cholestasis  (elevated  serum 
alkaline phosphatase)  
AND  
3) No other immediate ly apparent possible causes  of AST/ALT  elevation  and 
hyperbilirubinemia, including,  but not limite d to, viral hepatitis , pre-existin g chroni c 
or acute liver disease , or the administration of other drug(s) known to be hepatotoxic. 
 
7.5.6 Pregnancy Reporting  
 
Although pregnancy and lactation are not always serious by regulatory definition , it is the 
responsibility of investigators or their designees to report any pregnancy or lactation in a 
subject (spontaneously reported to them)  that occurs during the trial or within 6 months 
of completing the trial. This  also includ es the pregnancy of a male subject's female partner 
who has provided written consent to provide in formation regarding pregnancy, which  
occurs during the trial or within 6 months of completing the trial.   
 
An “Initial Pregnancy Report” or equivalent must be completed in full and emailed to the 
IND Sponsor  and Incyte (
within 24 hours of discovery of a pregnancy of a subject 
who has taken the Incyte product or the pregnancy of a partner for a subject who has taken 
the Incyte product.  The “Follow- up Pregnancy Report” o r equivalent must be completed 
and emailed to the IND Sponsor 
within 30 days after 
delivery, so that the IND Sponsor and Incyte are provided with information regarding the 
outcome of the pregnancy.  If the pregnancy results in any event (s) which meet the serious 
criteria (i.e., miscarriage or termination), the SAE reporting process needs to be followed 
and the timelines associated with a SAE should be followed. 
 
7.5.7  Institutional Review Board (IRB)   
 
Serious adverse events will be reported to the IRB per institutional standards. Upon 
receipt, follow -up information will be given to the IRB (as soon  as relevant information 
is available) per institutional standards.  
 
7.5.8  Food and Drug Administration (FDA)  
 
All reporting to the FDA will be completed by the IND Sponsor. 
 
7.5.8.1 Expedited IND Safety Reports 
 
7 Calendar-Day Telephone or Fax Report :   
The IND Sponsor is required to notify the FDA of any fatal or life -threatening 
adverse event that is unexpected and assessed by the investigator to be possibly 

J19106 /  Version 9.0/ July 20, 2022  
 34 related to the investigational agent.  Such reports are to be emailed to the 
regulatory project manager and faxed ( 301-796-9845)  to the FDA within 7 
calendar days of first learning of the event . Follow -up information will be 
submitted to the FDA as soon as relevant information is available.   
 
15 Calendar -Day Written Report :   
The IND Sponsor is required to notify the FDA of any SAE that is unexpected 
and related to the investigational agent in a written IND Safety Report.   
 Written IND Safety Reports should include an Analysis of Similar Events in accordance with regulation 21 CFR § 312.32.  All safety repor ts previously filed 
with the IND concerning similar events should be analyzed.  The new report should contain comments on the significance of the new event in light of the previous, similar reports.    Written IND safety reports with Analysis of Similar Ev ents are to be submitted 
to the FDA within 15 calendar days of first learning of the event. Follow -up 
information will be submitted to the FDA as soon as relevant information is available.  
 7.5.8.2 IND Annual Reports  
 
In accordance with the regulation 21 C FR § 312.33 , the IND Sponsor shall within 
60 days of the anniversary date that the IND went into effect submit a brief report of the adverse events and progress of the investigation.  Please refer to Code of 
Federal Regulations, 21 CFR § 312. 33 for a list of the elements required for the 
annual report.  All IND annual reports will be submitted to the FDA by the IND 
Sponsor.

J19106 /  Version 9.0/ July 20, 2022  
 36  
8.1.10 Returns and Reco nciliation  
 
The investigator is responsible for keeping accurate records of the clinical supplies 
received from Incyte or designee, the amount dispensed to, and returned by the subjects 
and the amount remaining at the conclusion of the trial.  
 
Upon completion or termination of the study, all unused and/or partially used 
investigational product will be destroyed at the site per institutional policy. It is the 
Investigator’s responsibility to arrange for disposal of all empty containers, provided that 
procedu res for proper disposal have been established according to applicable federal, state, 
local and institutional guidelines and procedures, and provided that appropriate records of 
disposal are kept.  
  

J19106 /  Version 9.0/ July 20, 2022  
 37 9. CORRELATIVE/SPECIAL STUDIES  
 
We have incorporated numerous correlative studies that will allow us to better understand ASQ anti-PD-1 response and resistance mechanisms. We plan to test tissue pre and post treatment for 
markers of immunogenicity and susceptibility to immunotherapy. Thi s will be accomplished 
through immunohistochemical and  multiplex immunofluorescence staining studies of tumor cells 
and TME immune cells and next -generation sequencing  of pre and post treatment samples.  These 
results will be correlated with response  or res istance to retifanlimab . 
 We plan to explore:  
• Immunosuppressive molecules and immune checkpoint proteins (PD -L1, PD -1, LAG3, TIM3, 
VISTA and IDO).  
• Immune infiltrating pro and anti- inflammatory cells (T cell subsets via IHC for CD4+, CD8+, 
CD20, FOXP3, and CD68, myeloid- derived suppressor cells, dendritic cells etc.).  
• Gene signatures of tumor and immune cell s including m olecular mutational status and tumor 
mutation burden.  
• Further sequencing of T cell receptor (TCR) genes to evaluate infiltrating T cell repertoire.  
 Several CLIA -certified laboratories now offer molecular profiling of cancer specimens in 
commercial and noncommercial settings and provide these results to patients and their physicians (e.g. Foundation Medicine, PGDx, Michigan Center for Trans lational Pathology, or JHU CLIA 
Laboratories). It is possible, therefore, that some of our research analyses will be conducted in these CLIA -certified environments.  If tissue or cells are evaluated with next generation 
sequencing strategies to provide a m olecular profile of individual cancer specimens in a CLIA -
certified facility, these results will be made available to the patient and their physician.  Patient 
confidentiality will be maintained, and the patient’s identity will not be publicly linked to an y 
study results.  Researchers may use the data set generated in the CLIA assay setting to study genetic alterations across a large number of genes important in cancer. Germline mutations are only identified in punitive cancer genes. Researchers will use th e data set for exploratory research to 
study cancer cell heterogeneity. Some of the sequencing data obtained from the NGS strategies will be uploaded to government sponsored databases, such as GEO and dbGAP.  The results of the research studies may be publ ished but subjects will not be identified in any publication. 
 If a germline alteration of clinical importance (as judged by the Investigator) to the subject and his or her family members is identified by a CLIA -certified test in the course of this analysi s, attempts 
will be made in writing to contact the subject and/or family members for genetic counseling referral.  Results from the sequencing studies will not be released to the patients.  
 For patients whose tumors have not been sent to CLIA -certified seq uencing laboratories, 
sequencing on archival tissue or biopsy tissue collected for the  studies are for research purposes 
only, and the sequencing studies are not using a clinically validated platform  and will be performed 
as batched analysis for research r ather than real time . Accordingly, they will not be released to the 
patients.  
  
J19106 /  Version 9.0/ July 20, 2022  
 38 9.1 Tumor Tissue Studies  
 
Tumor biopsies will be collected  (if a subject ’s tumor is thought to be reasonably safe and easy to 
biopsy) at baseline and at Cycle 3 (4-6 cores per time  point) . Fine needle aspiration will not be 
acceptable. Additional optional biopsies may be obtained later in the course of study treatment.  
 
Attempts will be made to obtain archived tissue samples from all subjects.  Archived FNA biopsy samples do not contain sufficient tissue and will not be collected.   
 Detailed instructions for tissue collection, processing , storage, and shipment will be provide d in 
the Lab oratory  Manual . 
 9.2 Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs) 
 
Whole blood for isolation of PB MCs will be collected prior to dosing on Day 1 of  Cycle s 1, 2, 3, 
and 5 as well at the time of progression or off -study . Pre- and post-treatment changes  in PBMCs 
including effector, helper, and regulatory T cells, NK cells, and macrophages through cell 
phenotyping analysis and gene expression profiling will be measured.  Detailed instructions for 
collection, processing, storage, and shippi ng are provided in the Laboratory Manual.  
9.3 Serum and Plasma Marker and Liquid biopsy/ctDNA  Studies  
 
Sera will be collected at the same time points as whole blood sampling, as described above. Potential therapeutic targets, biomarkers, and predictors of response and autoimmune toxicity will 
be evaluated . Detailed instructions for collection, processing, storage , and shipping are provided 
in the Laboratory Manual. 
 9.4 Diagnostic Tissue Samples  
 Tissue, fluid, or blood may be collected from standard of care procedures used to treat or diagnose 
immune -related toxicities.

In order to minimize the need for research -only in -person visits, telemedicine visits may be substituted for in -
person clinical trial visits or portions of clinical trial visits where determined to be appropriate and where 
determined by the investigator not to increas e the participants risks. Prior to initiating telemedicine for study visits 
the study team will explain to the participant, what a telemedicine visit entails and confirm that the study 
participant is in agreement and able to proceed with this method. Telem edicine acknowledgement will be obtained 
in accordance with the Guidance for Use of Telemedicine in Research. In the event telemedicine is not deemed 
feasible, the study visit will proceed as an in -person visit. Telemedicine visits will be conducted using HIPAA 
compliant method approved by the Health System and within licensing restrictions.

11: Labs may be collected within a window of up to 3 days prior to dosing.  
12: ECG should be performed at baseline.  
13: Spiral CT of thorax, abdomen and pelvis (and other imaging studies as clinically indicated to evaluate 
suspected sites of metastatic disease). If a subject cannot have a CT scan (e.g., allergy to contrast dye), 
an MRI should be performed. 3-D CT scans and RECIST reads will not be used to determine eligibility 
at baseline. On study r adiologic evaluations and  tumor measurements (RECIST and i RECIST  per 
Appendix B and Appendix C) will be performed every 8 weeks (± 1 week; starting from the date of 
first treatment) including the EOT evaluation (± 4 weeks). If the EOT visit occurs early, scans do not 
need to be re peated if  one has been done within the past 6 weeks.  Weeks are in reference to calendar 
week and should not be adjusted due to dosing delays.  
14: Up to 120 mL of whole blood for PBMC isolation will be drawn cycle 1, 2, 3, and 5 and must be 
processed by sponsor -qualified operators within 6 hours of collection and stored in liquid nitrogen. 
Approximately 20 mL of whole blood for plasma collection and another a pproximately 5 mL of blood 
for serum for immune monitoring.  Detailed instructions for tissue collection, processing and shipment 
are provided in the Laboratory Manual.  Patients who discontinue retifanlimab with SD or better and 
later restart after off -treatment progression will have additional research bloods collected (same volum e 
and type as above) at similar intervals as at the start of study:  i.e. prior to the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 5th cycles 
of retreatment (though the actual cycle numbers will continue where subject was discontinued).  
J19106 /  Version 9.0/ July 20, 2022  
 41 15: Attempts to obtain surgical or biopsy ar chival tumor samples will be made for every subject until the 
sample is obtained or documentation that the sample cannot be obtained. Detailed instructions for tissue

baseline and at Cycle 3 (4 -6 cores per timepoint). The Cycle 3 biopsy has a ± 1 week window. 
Additional optional biopsies may be obtained later in the course of  study treatment  or at progression . 
Fine needle aspiration will not be acceptable. Detailed instructions for tissue collection, processing and 
shipment are provided in the Laboratory Manual. Patients who discontinue retifanlimab with SD or 
better and later  restart after off-treatment progression may have an additional biops y collected prior to 
resuming study treatment.  
17: Patients who stop retifanlimab  with SD or better may be eligible for additional retifanlimab  therapy if  
they progress after stopping study drug, they meet the criteria listed in Section 5. 9.2, and undergo the 
following  evaluations: interval medical and cancer history, physical exam, vitals, weight, PS, 
hematology and chemistry profile, endocrine panel, urina lysis, serum or urine pregnancy test, CA19 -9, 
radiographic evaluations, and tumor measurements. Subjects who restart treatment after  relapse should 
resume at the next cycle which they would have received prior to discontinuation.  Additional research  
sample s will also be collected prior to restarting treatment  and while on study (see footnotes 14 and 16 
for details).  
18: Cycle 1 Day 1 evaluations do not need to be repeated if they were conducted within 3 days of the 
screening  evaluations.  
19: Day 15 (± 1 day) adverse event assessments may be conducted by telephone or email  after cycle 2 day 
1. 
20: Subjects will return to the study site for an EOT evaluation. EOT follow -up will occur 28 (±7) days 
after the last  dose of study drug. NOTE: CT scan assessment at EOT will occur 28 days (± 4 weeks) 
after the final dose. If the EOT visit occurs early (or if  the patient cannot return due to disease 
progression), an assessment for AEs should be made by telephone or email on day 28 (±1) after last study dose. Subjects who restart study drug after off -treatment progression should have a second EOT 
visit performe d when they stop study drug a second time.  
21: Subjects who discontinue treatment should be contacted by telephone or email at 90 days (+ 14 day 
reporting window) from their last dose of study drug or within 7 days before initiation of a new 
antineoplastic  treatment (whichever comes first) to assess for treatment related toxicities. In addition, 
all SAEs occurring during this time should be reported as well.  
22: Subjects who discontinue treatment without disease progression should continue to be monitored f or 
disease status by radiologic imaging ( Section 5.12.2 ). Disease monitoring should continue to be 
assessed every two months ( ± 2 weeks)  for the first 2 years and then every 3 months (± 4 weeks)  until: 
1) start of a new antineoplastic therapy (information of the new cancer therapy will be collected), 2) disease progression, 3) death, 4) withdrawal of consent, or 5) study closure, whichever occurs first.  
23: Subjects who discontinue treatment will enter the survival follow -up portion of the trial  (Section 
5.12.3). Subjects  should be contacted every 12 weeks (±  2 weeks) to monitor overall survival. 
Information of other cancer therapies after discontinuation from the study treatment wil l be collected 
as well.  
J19106 /  Version 9.0/ July 20, 2022  
 42 11.  STUDY ENDPOINTS  
 
11.1 Primary Endpoint  
 The primary endpoint is DCR at 4 months following the start of treatment with retifanlimab , which 
is defined as the proportion of subjects with PR or CR or stable disease according to RECIST 1.1  
following 4 months from the start of therapy . Subjects who discontinue due to toxicity prior to 
post-baseline tumor assessments will be evaluable and considered treatment failures.  Otherwise, 
subjects who discontinue or do not have any post -baseline scans for other reasons including 
withdrawal of consent or being lost to follow -up prior to C2D1  will be replaced and not included 
in the primary efficacy analysis.  
 11.2 Secondary Endpoints  
 The secondary endpoints are as follows:  
 
• ORR is defined as the proportion of subjects with PR or CR according to RECIST 1.1. Subjects who discontinue due to toxicity or clinical progression prior to post -
baseline tumor assessments will be considered as non -responders.   Otherwise, 
subjects who discontinue or do not have any post -baseline scans for other reasons 
including withdrawal of consent or being lost to follow -up prior to C2D1 will be 
replaced and not included in the primary efficacy analysis . 
• Progression- free survival (PFS) is defined as the number of months from the first

 43 11.3 Exploratory Endpoints  
 
• OS, DOR, TTP. 
− Overall survival (OS) is defined as the number of months from the first dose of 
retifanlimab  until death or end of follow -up (OS will be censored on the date 
the subject was last known to be alive for subjects without documentation of 
death at the time of analysis).  
− Duration of Response (DOR) is defined as the number of months from the first documentation of a response to date of disease progression.  
− Time to -progression (TTP) is defined as the number o f months from the first 
dose of retifanlimab  to the date of documented disease progression (PD or 
relapse from CR as assessed using RECIST 1.1 criteria). It differs from PFS in that it does not include death in the definition of an event.  TTP will be cens ored 
at the date of the last scan for subjects without documentation of disease progression at the time of analysis.  
− Disease control rate (DCR) is defined as the proportion of subjects with complete response, partial response and stable disease  
• Disease con trol rate, o bjective response rate,  progression- free survival,  and 
duration of response measured by i RECIST

 12.4 Study Documentation 
 
12.4.1 Informed Consent and Authorization for use and Disclosure of Protected 
Health Information  
 Written informed consent and authorization of use and disclosure of protected health information (PHI) must be obtained from each subject (or the subject’s legally authorized 
representative) before performing any study- specific screening/baseline period 
evaluations. The ICF and authorization for use and disclosure of PHI, which is prepared by the investigator or th e site, must be reviewed and approved by the IND Sponsor, the study 
monitor (if applicable), and the site’s IRB before the initiation of the study.  
   
J19106 /  Version 9.0/ July 20, 2022  
 46 12.4.2 Investigator Study Files  
 
The IND Sponsor or designee will be responsible for maintaining origina l and backup of 
all CRF data. I nvestigator will maintain  backup of all electronic  data systems used for 
primary documentation or source documentation. Backup of electronic data will be 
performed periodically. Backup records will be stored at a secure locat ion on site and 
backup and recovery logs will be maintain ed to facilitate data recovery.  
 Changes to any electronic records require an audit trail, in accordance with 21 CFR 11.10(e), and should include who made the changes and when and why the changes wer e 
made. An audit trail is defined as a secure, computer -generated, time -stamped electronic 
record that will allow reconstruction of the course of events relating to the creation, modification and deletion of an electronic record. Audit trails must be creat ed 
incrementally, in chronological order and in a manner that does not allow new audit trail information to overwrite existing data. Audit trails should be in a readable format and readily available at the study site and any other location where electronic study records are 
maintained.  
 Audit trails are generated automatically for eCRFs . The investigator is responsible for 
maintaining audit trails of all electronic data systems used for primary documentation or source documentation.  
 
12.4.3 Case Report Forms and Source Documentation  
 The investigator must make study data accessible to the site monitor, to other authorized 
representatives of the IND Sponsor (or designee) and to the appropriate r egulatory 
authority inspectors.  
 
12.4.4 Retention of S tudy Documents  
 According to ICH E6, Section 4.9, all CRFs, as well as supporting paper and electronic documentation and administrative records, must be retained for at least 2 years after the last approval of a marketing application and until there are no pending or contemplated 
marketing applications, or at least 2 years have elapsed since the formal discontinuation of clinical development of an individual product. Longer retention periods may apply.  
 Audit trails for electronic documents will be retaine d for a period at least as long as that 
required for the subject electronic records to which they pertain. The investigator will retain 
either the original or a certified copy of audit trails.  
 12.4.5 Data Confidentiality and Subject Anonymity  
 All information about the nature of the proposed investigation provided by the IND Sponsor or their representative to the investigator (with the exception of information required by law or regulations to be disclosed to the IRB, the subject or the appropri ate 
regulatory authority) must be kept in confidence by the investigator.  
 
J19106 /  Version 9.0/ July 20, 2022  
 47 The anonymity of participating subjects must be maintained. Subjects will be identified by 
their initials and an assigned subject number on CRFs and other documents retrieved from the site or sent to the IND Sponsor, study monitor, Incyte , regulatory agencies, or central 
laboratories/reviewers. Documents that identify the subject (e.g., the signed ICF) will  be 
maintained in strict confidence by the investigator, except to the extent necessary to allow auditing by the appropriate regulatory authority, IND Sponsor or their representative.  
  13. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 13.1 Study Design/Endpoints  
 
Sample Size calculation and justification  
 Simon's two- stage optimal design will be used  
18. The null hypothesis that the true disease control  
rate at 4 months is 5% will be tested against a one -sided  alternative  of 30 % disease control rate at 
4 months . In the first stage, 7 patients will be accrued. If there are zero patients  with disease control  
by 4 months , the study will be stopped. Otherwise, 14 additional patients will be accrued for a total 
of 21 patients. The nul l hypothesis ( disease control rate of 5%) will be rejected if 3 or more patients 
with disease control at 4 months are observed in stage 1 and 2 combined. This design yields a type 
I error rate of 0.064 (target type I error 0. 1) and power of 90% when the true disease control  rate 
is 30%. The probability of stopping the trial early for futility is 70% if the true DCR is 5%.  
 
We plan to enroll 25 subjects to ensure 21 would be evaluable for DCR. As this is a rare tumor subtype patients will be rec ruited at several sites including Johns Hopkins Hospital, Memorial 
Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and the Mayo Clinic. We do not anticipate any difficulties in trial 
enrollment. We expect an accrual rate of at least 2 patients per month across the sites, co mpleting 
trial enrollment in 12 months.  
 
Patients are evaluable for DCR if they receive at least one dose of retifanlimab , and have at least 
one post -baseline tumor assessments or discontinue due to toxicity or clinical progression prior to 
post-baseline t umor assessments. The study plans to enroll 25 subjects to ensure 2 1 would be 
evaluable for the primary efficacy endpoint.  
 
There is no reliable historical control data documenting response rates and disease control rates 
with chemotherapy or any other age nt in ASQ. Previous clinical trials of single agent checkpoint 
inhibitors in pancreatic cancer have reported 0% ORR (anti -PD1, PDL1, CTLA4)
2–6. A recent t rial 
investigating anti -PDL1 combined with anti -CTLA4 therapy or anti -PD-L1 alone in metastatic 
PDAC reported ORR of 3.1% and 0% with the combination and single agent, respectively. This trial also reported a median PFS of 1.5 months in both cohorts, DCR a t 3 months of 9.4% and 6.1% 
and PFS rate at 6 months of 9.4% and 3.6% in the combination and single agent cohorts, respectively
5. Given the results of these trials, the phenomenon that immunotherapy often has a 
delayed effect compared to chemotherapy and ASQ being  an aggressive disease with limited 
treatment options the primary endpoint of this study will be a 30% DCR at four months . 
  
J19106 /  Version 9.0/ July 20, 2022  
 48 13.2 Data and A nalysis P lan  
 
Analysis of Primary Endpoint  
 
The primary endpoint of the study will be disease control (DC) at four months using RECIST 1.1. DC is defined as complete response, partial response and stable disease at 4 months, per RECIST 
1.1. Disease control rate (DCR) will be estimated as the proportion of patients who achieve DC at 4 months, along with 95% confide nce interval  
  
Analysis of Secondary Clinical  Endpoint  
 The objective response rate defined as the proportion of response evaluable subjects who have a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) using RECIST 1.1 criteria at any time during the study. The evaluable population includes all subjects who have completed at least one dose of 
retifanlimab  and have received at least one follow -up scan or discontinue due to toxicity or clinical 
progression prior to post -baseline tumor assessments. Response rate  will be reported with exact 
95% confidence interval.   Progression- free Survival (PFS) is defined as the time from cycle 1, day 1 of retifanlimab  until 
first documented local progression or death due to any cause. Disease progression will be assessed using RECIST (version 1.1)  and/or documented clinical progression as assessed by the treating 
provider . Due to the expectation that some patients may experience delayed clinical responses to 
therapy, patients with disease progression by radiographic imaging or  laboratory parameters 
during a 12- week evaluation period but without rapid clinical deterioration or significant change 
in performance status that requires additional immediate therapy may continue to receive treatment on study. Subjects that meet the above criteria and continue on study therapy must discontinue treatment upon documentation of disease progression on the second scan. The date of progression will be backdated to the time of first RECIST criteria progression. Tumor assessments will be made us ing RECIST 1.1 and immune RECIST (iRECIST) . Individuals will be censored at the date 
of the last scan prior to initiation of an alternative therapy for PFS if no event occurs  before the  
start of the  alternative therapy .  
 PFS will be summarized descriptive ly using the Kaplan- Meier method. Analysis of PFS  will be 
restricted to evaluable individuals who complete at least one dose of retifanlimab
.  
 
Analysis of Safety Endpoints  
 The safety analysis will be performed in all subjects who receive at least one dose of study drug. A baseline measurement and at least 1 laboratory or other safety -related measurement obtained 
after at least 1 dose of study treatment may be required for in clusion in the analysis of a specific 
safety parameter (e.g., lab shifts from baseline). A complete list of all AE data will be provided along with an assessment of NCI CTCAE grade and relationship to study drug. The incidence of AEs will be tabulated by s ubgroups of interest (e.g. grade 3 or higher, organ class, relationship to 
study drug). For analyses at the individual level, the highest grade and relationship to study drug will be assumed if multiple events have occurred. Toxicity will be tabulated by t ype and grade and 
will be summarized with descriptive statistics. Other safety data will be assessed in terms of 
J19106 /  Version 9.0/ July 20, 2022  
 49 physical examination, clinical chemistry, hematology, vital signs, and ECGs. Negative binomial 
regression and Cox proportional hazards models w ill be used to assess the rate of AE and time to 
first toxicity, respectively.  
 
Exploratory Clinical Analysis  
 Overall survival is defined as the duration of time from start of study treatment to time of death. For subjects lost to follow -up or whose vital  status is unknown, every effort will be made to 
determine the date such subjects were last known to be alive. Such efforts may include phone calls, certified mail, and the checking of public records. Subjects who are alive or lost to follow -up as of 
the data analysis cutoff date will be right -censored. The censoring date will be determined from 
the date the subject was last known to be alive.  
 OS will be summarized descriptively using the Kaplan -Meier method. Analysis of OS will be 
restricted to evaluable  individuals who complete at least one dose of retifanlimab . Median event -
free survival will be reported and the associated 95% confidence interval will be estimated.  
 DOR and TTP  were defined in second 11.3.  
 
Exploratory Biomarker Analysis  
 To specifical ly evaluate the impact of therapy on the tumor microenvironment, we will compare 
biopsies obtained at baseline vs. after two  cycles of retifanlimab  (refer to section on Trial Design).  
In addition, immune effector cell phenotype circulating in peripheral b lood will be assessed. 
Exploratory data analyses will include plots and summary statistics of these immunologic 
correlative markers at baseline as well as at the various time points. Patterns of change in the 
longitudinal data on these markers will be eval uated in this manner for each of the correlative 
outcomes of interest. Exploratory analyses can also be conducted to examine potential differences in various immune biomarkers between patients who have disease control (prolonged SD or any response vs. thos e with progressive disease). Linear mixed models can also be used to explore 
differences in these markers between the two outcome groups along with graphical analyses that plot marker values across time for the two groups to assess potentially different pa tterns of change 
between these groups. Appropriate transformations of the various correlative markers will be used in the presence of skewed data distributions.  
 13.3 Safety Analysis  
 
The safety analysis will be performed in all treated subjects. AE data will be listed individually 
and incidence of AEs summarized by system organ class and preferred terms within a system organ class for each treatment group.  When calculating the incidence of AEs, each AE (based on preferred terminology defined by C TCAE version 5.0) will be counted only once for a given 
subject.  In analyses of grade and causality, if the same AE occurs on multiple occasions, the highest grade and strongest relationship to study drug will be assumed.  If 2 or more AEs are reported as  a unit, the individual terms will be rep orted as separate experiences.  
 
Changes in vital signs, hematology and clinical chemistry parameters from baseline to the end of the study will be examined.  Toxicity will be tabulated by type and grade. Toxicities will be 
J19106 /  Version 9.0/ July 20, 2022  
 50 characterized according to the CTCAE  version 5.0.  Treatment -emergent changes from normal to 
abnormal values in key laboratory parameters will be identified.  
 
13.4 Safety monitoring and stopping guidelines  
 Adverse events will be monitored during t he trial. The occurrence of unacceptable AEs,  as defined 
in Section 5.6 , at any time during the treatment will be the endpoint for safety monitoring.  If the 
events of unacceptable AEs appear to be higher than 33%, we will temporarily halt the study pending safety evaluation . A Beta (1.5, 5.5) prior, representing a toxicity rate of 21%, a slightly 
conservative estimate, was used in the development of the  stopping guidelines.  The therapy will 
be re -evaluated if the posterior probability that the toxicity rate exceeds the 33% boundary is 
greater than 60%.  Table  5 summarizes the stopping boundaries for unacceptable toxicities.

 53 APPENDIX B: Response  Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 Criteria for 
Evaluating Response in Solid Tumors  
 
RECIST version 1.1 will be used in this study for assessment of tumor response.  While either CT 
or MRI may be used utilized, as per RECIST 1.1, CT is the preferred imaging technique in this study.   
Disease Parameters  
 
Measurable disease :  Measurable lesions are defined as those that can be accurately measured in 
at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as >20 mm by chest x -ray, as > 10 mm 
with CT scan, or > 10 mm with calipers by clinical exam.  All tumor measurements must be 
recorded in millimeters  (or decimal fractions of centimeters).  
 
Note:  Tumor lesions that are situated in a previously irradiated area might or might not be considered measurable unless there is evidence of progression in the irradiated site. Malignant 
lymph nodes.  To be considered pathologically enlarged and measurable, a lymph node must 
be >15 mm in short axis when assessed by CT scan (CT scan slice thickness recommended to 
be no greater than 5 mm).  At baseline and in follow -up, only the short axis will be measured 
and followed. 
 
Non-measurable disease :  All other lesions (or sites of disease), including small lesions (longest 
diameter <10 mm or pathological lymph nodes with ≥10 to <15 mm short axis), are considered non-measurable disease.  Bone lesions, leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural/pericardial 
effusions, lymphangitis cutis/pulmonitis, inflammatory breast disease, and abdominal masses (not followed by CT or MRI), are considered as non- measurable.  
 
Note:  Cystic lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically defined simple cysts should not be considered as malignant lesions (neither measurable nor non- measurable) since they are, by 
definition, simple cysts.  
 ‘Cystic lesions’ thought to represent cystic metastases can be considered as measurable lesions, if they meet the definition of measurability described above. However, if non- cystic lesions 
are present in the same subject , these are preferred for selection as target lesions.  
 
Target lesions:   All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesions per organ and 5 lesions in 
total, representative of all involved organs, should be identified as target lesions and recorded and 
measured at baseline.  Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest diameter), be representative of all in volved organs, but in addition should be those that 
lend themselves to reproducible repeated measurements.  It may be the case that, on occasion, the largest lesion does not lend itself to reproducible measurement in which circumstance the next largest les ion which can be measured reproducibly should be selected.  A sum of the diameters 
(longest for non- nodal lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) for all target lesions will be calculated 
and reported as the baseline sum diameters.  If lymph nodes are to be  included in the sum, then 
only the short axis is added into the sum.  The baseline sum diameters will be used as reference to further characterize any objective tumor regression in the measurable dimension of the disease.  
 
J19106 /  Version 9.0/ July 20, 2022  
 54 Non-target lesions :  All other lesions (or sites of disease) including any measurable lesions over 
and above the 5 target lesions should be identified as non -target lesions and should also be 
recorded at baseline.  Measurements of these lesions are not required, but the presence, absence , 
or in rare cases unequivocal progression of each should be noted throughout follow -up.  
 
Evaluation of Target Lesions  
 
Complete Response (CR) : Disappearance of all target lesions.  Any pathological lymph nodes 
(whether target or non- target) must have reduction in short axis to <10 mm. 
 
Partial Response (PR) : At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking 
as reference the baseline sum diameters.  
 
Progressive Disease (PD) : At least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, 
taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study).  In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm.   (Note:  the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered 
progressions). 
 
Stable Disease (SD) : Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to 
qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on st udy. 
 Evaluation of Non -Target Lesions  
 
Complete Response (CR) : Disappearance of all non -target lesions and normalization of tumor 
marker level.  All lymph nodes must be non- pathological in size (<10 mm short axis).  
 Note:  If tumor markers are initially above the upper normal limit, they must normalize for a subject  
to be considered in complete clinical response.  
 
Non-CR/Non -PD: Persistence of one or more non- target lesion(s) and/or maintenance of tumor 
marker level above the normal limits.  
 
Progressive Disease (PD) : Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression  
of existing non- target lesions.  Unequivocal progression should not normally trump target lesion 
status.  It must be representati ve of overall disease status change, not a single lesion increase.     
 Although a clear progression of “non- target” lesions only is exceptional, the opinion of the treating 
physician should prevail in such circumstances, and the progression status should be confirmed at a later time by the review panel (or Principal Investigator).  
 Evaluation of Best Overall Response  
 The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the treatment until disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started).  The subject 's best response assignment will depend on the 
achievement of both measurement and confirmation criteria.

 56 APPENDIX C : Description of the iRECIST Process for  Assessment of Disease Progression   
 
Assessment at Screening and Prior to RECIST 1.1 Progression  
 Until radiographic progression based on RECIST 1.1, there is no distinct iRECIST assessment.  
 Assessment and Decision at RECIST 1.1 Progression  
 In participan ts who show evidence of radiological PD by RECIST 1.1 the Investigator will decide 
whether to continue a participant on study treatment until repeat imaging is obtained using the criteria outlined in Section 5. 9.1. 
 If the Investigator decides to continue treatment, the participant may continue to receive study treatment and the tumor assessment should be repeated 4 to 8 weeks later to confirm PD by iRECIST, per Investigator assessment.  
 Tumor flare may manifest as any factor causing radiographic progressio n per RECIST 1.1, 
including:  
• Increase in the sum of diameters of target lesion(s) identified at baseline to ≥  20% and 
≥ 5 mm from nadir  
o Please note: the iRECIST publication uses the terminology “sum of measurements”, but “sum of diameters” will be used in this protocol, consistent with the original 
RECIST 1.1 terminology. 
• Unequivocal progression of non- target lesion(s) identified at baseline  
• Development of new lesion(s)  
 iRECIST defines new response categories, including  iUPD (unconfirmed progressive disease) and 
iCPD (confirmed progressive disease).  For purposes of iRECIST assessment, the first visit 
showing progression according to RECIST 1.1 will be assigned a visit (overall) response of iUPD, 
regardless of which factors caused the progression. 
At this visit, target and non -target lesions identified at baseline by RECIST 1.1 will be assessed as 
usual.  
New lesions will be classified as measurable or non -measurable, using the same size thresholds 
and rules as for baseline lesion assessment in RECIST 1.1.  From measurable new lesions, up to 5 lesions total (up to 2 per organ), may be selected as New Lesions – Target.  The sum of diameters 
of these lesions will be calculated, and kept distinct from the sum of diameters for targe t lesions at 
baseline.  All other new lesions will be followed qualitatively as New Lesions – Non -target.  
Assessment at the Confirmatory Imaging 
On the confirmatory imaging, the participant will be classified as progression confirmed (with an 
overall respo nse of iCPD), or as showing persistent unconfirmed progression (with an overall 
response of iUPD), or as showing disease stability or response (iSD/iPR/iCR). 
J19106 /  Version 9.0/ July 20, 2022  
 57 Confirmation of Progression  
Progression is considered confirmed, and the overall response will be iCPD, if ANY of the 
following occurs:  
• Any of the factors that were the basis for the initial iUPD show worsening  
o For target lesions, worsening is a further increase in the sum of diameters of ≥  5 mm, 
compared to any prior iUPD time point  
o For non- target les ions, worsening is any significant growth in lesions overall, compared 
to a prior iUPD time point; this does not have to meet the “unequivocal” standard of RECIST 1.1  
o For new lesions, worsening is any of these:  
 An increase in the new lesion sum of diameter s by ≥  5 mm from a prior iUPD time 
point  
 Visible growth of new non- target lesions  
 The appearance of additional new lesions  
• Any new factor appears that would have triggered PD by RECIST 1.1 
Persistent iUPD  
Progression is considered not confirmed, and the overall response remains iUPD, if:  
• None of the progression- confirming factors identified above occurs AND  
• The target lesion sum of diameters (initial target lesions) remains above the initial PD threshold (by RECIST 1.1)  
Additional imaging for confirmation should be scheduled 4 to 8 weeks from the scan on which 
iUPD is seen.  This may correspond to the next visit in the original visit schedule.  The assessment of the subsequent confirmation scan proceeds in an identical manner, with possible out comes of 
iCPD, iUPD, and iSD/iPR/iCR.  
Resolution of iUPD  
Progression is considered not confirmed, and the overall response becomes iSD/iPR/iCR, if:  
• None of the progression- confirming factors identified above occurs, AND  
• The target lesion sum of diameters ( initial target lesions) is not above the initial PD 
threshold.  
The response is classified as iSD or iPR (depending on the sum of diameters of the target lesions), or iCR if all lesions resolve.  
In this case, the initial iUPD is considered to be pseudo -progression, and the level of suspicion for 
progression is “reset”.  This means that the next visit that shows radiographic progression, 
J19106 /  Version 9.0/ July 20, 2022  
 58 whenever it occurs, is again classified as iUPD by iRECIST, and the confirmation process is 
repeated before a response of iCPD can be assigned.  
Detection of Progression at Visits After Pseudo -progression Resolves  
After resolution of pseudo -progression (i.e., achievement of iSD/iPR/iCR), iUPD is indicated by 
any of the following events:  
• Target lesions 
o Sum of diameters reaches the PD threshold (≥  20% and ≥  5 mm increase from nadir) 
either for the first time, or after resolution of previous pseudo -progression.  The nadir 
is always the smallest sum of diameters seen during the entire trial, either before or 
after an instance of pseudo -progression. 
• Non-target lesions  
o If non -target lesions have never shown unequivocal progression, their doing so for the 
first time results in iUPD.  
o If non- target lesions had shown previous unequivocal progression, and this progression  
has not resolved, iUPD results from any significant further growth of non- target 
lesions, taken as a whole. 
• New lesions  
o New lesions appear for the first time  
o Additional new lesions appear  
o Previously identified new target lesions show an increase of ≥  5 mm  in the new lesion 
sum of diameters, from the nadir value of that sum 
o Previously identified non- target lesions show any significant growth 
If any of the events above occur, the overall response for that visit is iUPD, and the iUPD evaluation process (see A ssessment at the Confirmatory Imaging above) is repeated.  Progression 
must be confirmed before iCPD can occur.  
The decision process is identical to the iUPD confirmation process for the initial PD, except in one respect. If new lesions occurred at a prior  instance of iUPD, and at the confirmatory scan the 
burden of new lesions has increased from its smallest value (for new target lesions, their sum of diameters is ≥5 mm increased from its nadir), then iUPD cannot resolve to iSD or iPR. It will 
remain iUPD until either a decrease in the new lesion burden allows resolution to iSD or iPR, or 
until a confirmatory factor causes iCPD.

 Clinical Protocol Synopsis   
 
1.  Title   
PCplanner: operationalizing needs -focused palliative care for older adults in intensive care units  
 
2.  Background  
The number of older adults who receive life support in an ICU  (currently 2 million per year ) is increasing 
while survival remains unchanged.  Yet the quality of ICU -based palliative care is highly variable across 
clinicians and hospitals . Namely, o lder adults often suffer from untreated symptoms in a technology -
focused setting; many caregivers (i.e., family members)  report poor quality communication and decision 
making, and clinicians struggle to connect with each other in a shiftwork environment.  Additionally, 
there are process barriers to improving the delivery of high quality palliative care  which  include 
difficulties  in efficiently identifying older adult patients and  family caregivers with the greatest burden of 
unmet palliative care needs, engaging family decision makers, and coordinating care by ICU teams and palliative care specialists.  
 To address these barriers, a mobile app platform prototype called PCplanner (Palliative Care planner) 
has been developed for patients, their family members , and clinicians.  PCplanner directly captures 
EHR data to automate the identification of older adults with palliative care needs based on clinical 
characteristics such as dementia and declining health status. The app engages families as partners in 
their loved one’s care by facilitating in a self -report of actual needs. Additionally, the app provides a 
scalable digital infrastructure for coordinating needs -targeted care from collaborating ICU teams and 
palliative care specialists.  In pilot work, PCplanner  reduced unmet needs, psychological distress, and 
length of stay while increasing goal concordant care, communication, and hospice utilization.  While these data are promising, the intervention requires a rigorous evaluation of efficacy.
1   
 3.  Study Design  
This is a 5- year, randomized controlled trial (RCT)  that aims to test a native, novel  web application 
called “PCplanner”  developed by an external technology vendor, One Cow Standing. PCplanner 
directly captures EHR data to automate the identification of older adults with palliative care needs 
based on clinical characteristics such as dementia and declining health status. The app engages 
families as partners in their loved one’s care by  facilitating in a self- report of actual needs. Additionally, 
the app provides a scalable digital infrastructure for coordinating needs -targeted care from collaborating 
ICU teams and palliative care specialists. The project specifically intends to randomize 150  older 
patients  aged ≥50years , their 150 self-described family members , plus their ICU clinicians  to determine 
if the intervention can improve family -reported unmet palliative care needs compared to standard of 
care.  
 Study Aims  
The project will operationalize this goal by completing three specific aims, which are described below:  
 
• Aim 1 : Optimize the usability of the PCplanner mobile app, specifically for older adults.  
Approach and goal:  To optimize the PCplanner mobile app platform before Aim 2’s clinical trial, 
key features will be added, based on user testing feedback, compatible for older adult 
caregivers and clinicians.  Iterative revisions based on usability participant feedback  will be 
performed until the app platform achieves ‘excellent’ usability (i.e., mean Systems Usability Scale (SUS) score > 60).  
 
• Aim 2 : Test the PCplanner intervention’s efficacy vs. usual care in a randomized clinical trial 
(RCT).  Hypotheses:  Compared to usual care at 8 days  post-randomization, PCplanner -
augmented care will improve family -reported unmet palliative care needs.  I t will also improve 
short -term and long-term (3 -month) secondary outcomes among family caregivers 
 
Protocol Version: 5.1   Dated: 13 June  2022  Page 7 of 42 
 (psychological distress  symptoms , quality of communication), patients (receipt of goal 
concordant treatment), and health systems (length of stay).  Approach and goal:  In academic 
and community medical center settings, the study team  will test these hypotheses among the 
family caregivers of medical and surgical ICU patients with dementia, declining health status, 
poor functioning, and other characteristics common to the aging experience.  
 
• Aim 3:  Explore family caregiver and clinician RCT experiences to characterize how these 
participants may have been impacted by intervention components in a variety of implementation 
contexts, with a goal of understanding intervention mechanisms and barriers to future 
implementation and dissemination. Approach and  goal:  Using a mixed methods approach, we 
will integrate findings from both qualitative analysis of semi -structured interviews via telephone 
with family caregivers and clinicians as well as quantitative family caregiver, patient, and care 
process outcomes.  This will provide insight into mechanisms of action and highlight methods for future intervention optimization through enhanced personalization, replicability, and 
scalability —all factors that are critical to successful implementation and dissemination of the 
intervention.  
 
Primary and Secondary Outcomes   
All outcomes have been piloted by the Duke University study  team  and chosen based on the 
conceptual model, expert recommendations, and psychometrics  (Table 1).
2-4  Response burden will be 
minimized with short instruments and online data entry via ePRO.5  Pilot testing confirmed completion 
in 15- 20 minutes and demonstrated that all outcomes were responsive at levels of clinical significance.1  
Data will be collected at pre- randomization baseline (T1 Data Collection) as well as 4 days (T2 Data 
Collection), 8 days (T3 Data Collection), and 3 months (T4 Data Collection) post -randomization.  
 Primary Outcomes  
For Aim 1, usability will be assessed with the SUS 
6 and analysis of semi -structured interview 
transcriptions, while  acceptability will be measured with the Client Satisfaction Questionnaire (CSQ -8).7   
 
For Aim 2, the primary RCT outcome will be unmet palliative care needs at T3 ( 8 days  post-
randomization) as reported by family caregivers using the Needs; Existential concerns; Symptoms; and Therapeutic interaction (NEST) scale.
1,8,9 The NEST , which assesses palliative care needs among both 
critically ill older adult patients and their family caregivers (and is completed by family caregivers), is the primary trial outcome and T3 is the primary timing of its measurement.
9  The NEST’s 13 items (score 
range 0 -130) sample each of the National Consensus Project’s eight domains of palliative care 
quality.10  The main patient -level outcome will be the receipt of goal concordant care at T2.11,12   
 
Secondary Outcomes  
Secondary outcomes will include family caregiver psychological distress symptoms measured with the PHQ -9 (depression),
13 the GAD -7 (anxiety),14 and the PTSS (PTSD) at survey 3 (T3) (1 week post -
randomization) and survey 4 (T4) (3 months). Systems outcomes will include post- randomization length 
of stay (LOS), use of aggressive care, discharge disposition, and hospice use.15,16  Clinicians  will 
complete a brief palliative care attitudes scale at the time of consent.17 Aim 3’s analysis of facilitators, 
barriers, and mechanisms will be based on transcribed semi -structured family and clinician interviews.   
 Study Overview  
Aim 1   
The previous pilot showed compelling results, but also identified targets that could substantially improve 
app functionality. However, changes in an app’s user interface or function, regardless of intention, can 
influence intervention delivery, data validity (e.g., ePRO system), as well as usability —the quality of the 
user's experience across domains of ease of use, efficiency, memorability, error rate, and 
 
Protocol Version: 5.1   Dated: 13 June  2022  Page 8 of 42 
 satisfaction.18-20  Usability testing is a critical procedure because it can identify any problems 
proactively, using lessons learned to improve the software before its introduction in a clinical trial 
setting.1,19,21   Therefore, Aim 1, a cross -sectional refinement ( not developmental) study involving 10 -15 
participants, will aim to improve efficiency, memorability, satisfaction, and overall decrease error rate.   
Participants eligible for this portion of the study will be healthy volunteers, specifically Duke employees,  
at least 18 years of age or older. Aim 1, completed concurrently with Aim 2 startup tasks , will target 
three key areas:  
1. Engagement and personalization: the study team will enable a 'Recommender System' to 
improve user experience including reminders and notifications, dashboard views unique to study 
role (e.g., CRC vs. clinical teams ), enhanced visualization of needs data, single- click ICU team 
approval for study team members to approach families, and hovering box feedback in response 
to user -completed tasks.   
2. Security:  The Duke Health Technology Support team will ensure  that the app system’s security  
adheres  to current standards  throughout the course of the trial . 
3. Interoperability: Standards will be used for EHR triggers with the assistance of DHTS ACE team programmers.   
 Aim 2  
The primary focus of the project is Aim 2, the RCT. Therefore, the majority of study activity will center 
on this particular aim.  The study workflow is shown in Appendix 1. 
 
As noted above, patients’ self -described family members will be enrolled in this project. The family 
members are the primary research subject of focus in that they will be asked to sign and date the 
informed consent for this study, undergo app registration, and complete a baseline survey (T1) for 
eligibility and subsequent randomization. If deemed eligible to continue in the study, as determined by 
their NEST score, each family member will be randomized to one of two study arms:  
 
• Arm 1 —PCplanner intervention : individuals randomized to this arm are considered to be 
“intervention”. All individuals who are randomized to this arm will have their survey 1 (T1), survey 2 (T2), and survey 3 (T3) results shared with the attending ICU clinician (and possibly palliative care clinician for non -responder intervention participants) on service at the time of 
consent  via an automatic, electronic notification from the web application. A fter the receipt of 
survey 1 (T1) results, the ICU clinician will conduct a one- on-one fami ly meeting  prior to survey 
2 (T2) completion by the family member . The purpose of this meeting is to discuss and attempt 
to address the needs reported by the family member. Should the family member continue to report high needs at the completion of survey 2 (T2), defined as a NEST score of ≥25 or T2 
NEST score > T1 NEST score, a formal Palliative Care  team consult will be sought by the 
clinical team for the family  member in an  attempt to discuss and address the reported needs.  
• Arm 2 —usual care control : Control family caregivers  will receive usual ICU care that does not 
include a protocolized palliative care consult.  Data collection will be identical to the intervention 
group (email/text links with unique URLs integrated with the trial data system), though data 
reported by family  members will not be visible in the PCplanner dashboard or otherwise 
available to clinicians.  Each usual care participant will be provided with telephone and email 
contacts for study staff to answer questions or address urgent distress.  A palliative care 
specialist consult is allowed for any control patient or family caregiver if ICU clinicians believe it 
is needed.  All such crossovers will be recorded (as will the total number of palliative care- family  
interactions).   
 
Randomization will be stratified b y three  variables :  
 
Protocol Version: 5.1   Dated: 13 June  2022  Page 9 of 42 
 • Department location at the time of ICU admission and informed consent (i.e., Medical versus Surgical)  
• Palliative Care Trigger type (i.e., Acute versus C hronic; see Appendix 2) 
• Baseline NEST score (i.e., ≥ 25 vs. <25 but ≥10)  
 
All family members, regardless of their randomization arm will be asked to complete a total of four surveys, as listed below (see A ppendix  3 for survey timeline):  
• T1: to be completed within 72 hours of informed consent; study day 1  
• T2: to be completed on study day 4  
• T3: to be completed on study day 8  
• T4: to be completed on study day 90  
 Surveys are completed remotely and electronically via the web application by the enrolled family 
member. Reminders are automatically provided by the PCplanner platform to the family members via 
email and/or text alerts to complete the surveys  (Appendix 4) . 
 Patients enrolled into this study , at the consent of their legally authorized representative (LAR) , will 
passively participate in the study. Passive participation includes allowing the study team to access and abstract relevant clinical data from the patient’s  EMR. The clinical data abstracted for the purposes of 
this research project will be housed in the secure, EDC ( REDCap ). 
 Clinicians, whether ICU attending or Palliative Care, will be asked to complete a baseline survey at the time 
in which informed consent is obtained. The baseline survey will collect relevant information from the 
clinician, such as sociodemographic and professional information, as well a contact information (e.g., email 
address and cell phone number). Clinicians, who are assigned to an intervention family, will receive automatic text and/or email alerts via the web application informing them of the completed survey(s), 
reported needs, and the need to complete a family meeting.  
 Aim 3   
Each month during Aim 2’s RCT, we will purposefully sample up to 30 patient cases; a patient case 
being defined as 1 family caregiver and the associated clinician(s)  from the intervention group.
22,23 The 
sampling will be stratified  to ensure variability in factors that may influence ex periences relevant to 
patients (e.g., trigger type), family caregivers ( i.e., gender, race, age, confidence with technology, 
baseline NEST), and clinicians ( i.e., medical vs. surgical ). Each patient case selected will be asked to 
undergo a single 30- minute semi -structured interview with each case participant conducted at T2 that 
focuses on exploring the participant’s experiences with core intervention components and palli ative 
care processes.24,25 
 
4.  Study Population  
Eligibility apply to participants in all study Aims  with the exception of Aim 1 in which healthy volunteers 
will be asked to test the usability of the web application. Healthy volunteers for Aim 1 will be recruited 
Duke employees.  Briefly, i nclusion criteria for patients  and family caregivers , defined as the individual 
(related or unrelated) who provides the most support and with whom the patient has a significant relationship. Although only one family caregiver per patient is eligible, other family can participate in 
family meetings if they wish.  Patients’ bedside ICU clinicians  on the day of family consent are eligible.  
Patient exclusions include previous palliative care consult.  Family caregiver exclusions are low need 
burden (NEST < 10) and lack of English fluency (the app is not validated in other languages).

focused on Aim 2 of the project. However, for Aims 1 and 3; the study team will be expected to maintain screening and enrollment logs, complete informed consent, and also required to maintain relevant 
study documentation, as outlined in the study MOP(s).  
 Screening, Recruitment and Informed Consent  
Screening for eligible patients will occur daily via the native web application, PCplanner by delegated 
study team members. PCplanner was developed to integrate with the EMR, MaestroCare, by “calling” 
to the EMR via an application programming interface (API) which retrieves patients’ clinical information 
that preliminarily meet study eligibility criteria. The study team will maintain a robust screening log of all patients reviewed and document the following (at a minimum):  
1. Date screening occurred.  
2. Whether or not the individual was eligible for the study. 
a. Reason for ineligibility, if applicable.  
3. If the individual  was approached for consent . 
a. Reason not approached for consent, if applicable.  
4. Outcome of consent.  
a. Declined, reason for decline, and date of decline.  
b. Consent, date of consent, and consent version number.  
 For those patients who are eligible to consent, the study team will either 1) release the patients, via the 
web application, to the attending ICU clinician (note: if the ICU clinician is not consented, the study 
team will be required to consent the ICU clinician prior to any further study activity)  or 2) automatically 
approach the eligible patient/family dyad for consent if the clinician has opted out of reviewing the 
patient/family dyad prior to approach. If scenario 1 is being utilized, t he ICU clinician will be asked to 
review the patient via the web application and determine if they are eligible for recruitment. If the ICU clinician denies the patient, the study team will not approach the patient’s family member for consent 
(unless otherwise discussed by  the study team and the clinical care team). If the ICU clinician approves 
the patient, the study team will recruit the family member in- person using the traditional method of 
informed consent or remotely using an approved telephone script. If scenario 2 is utilized the study 
 
Protocol Version: 5.1   Dated: 13 June  2022  Page 12 of 42 
 team will mark the family automatically mark the family as “approved” and approach the patient/family 
dyad for consent. Regarding of the scenario for recruitment, all family members will be approached at 
the time of their loved one’s ICU admission. Also, physicians will be texted by the study  team noting 
that they  will approach a patient allowing them to say ‘no’ if they choose .. If a patient has decision-
making capacity at the time of recruitment, he/she will be approached for consent, in addition to the 
family member. All individuals approached for consent to the study will be informed at the time of 
recruitment that research is voluntary and they do not have to participate if they do not want to. 
Furthermore, they will be informed that participation will not affect their loved one’s care positively or 
negatively. If a family member chooses to not participate, he/she will be documented as a ‘declined’ 
individual and the date of decline, as well as reason (if available) will be documented. Should a family 
member be approached and opt to consent, they will be asked to complete the app registration and 
survey 1 (T1) within 72 hours of consent. Eligibility to continue study participation will be determined 
automatically via an automated, electronic scoring system built within the web application. Additionally, 
if the individual is eligible to continue study participation, randomization to one of the two study arms 
will occur automatically and simultaneously. The study team and the family member will be alerted of  
the family member’s study status and randomization arm assignment. As with screening, the study team will be required to maintain a robust enrollment log includes the following information (at a 
minimum):  
1. Patient Information (i.e., name, MRN, location of enrollment, race, gender, ethnicity) and Family 
Member Information (i.e., name, DOB, race, gender, ethnicity). 
2. Consent, date of consent, and consent version number.  
3. Study status  (including randomization arm, assigned clinician, withdraw, lost to follow -up, study 
completion) 
4. Death (Patient and/or Family Member), including date  
 
It is important to note that for this study, there are several statuses a family member (and thus patient) 
can have. They are listed below:  
• Screened (in screening or screened): defined as any patient  who’s EMR has been reviewed 
against protocol for eligibility purposes. Individuals  who are assigned this status must be noted 
on the screening log.  
• Excluded: defined as any patient’s who’s EMR has been reviewed against protocol for eligibility 
purposes, but is found to not meet eligibility criteria, as determined by the study team. Individuals who are assigned this status must be noted on the screening log.  
• Released:  defined as any patient’s who’s EMR has been reviewed against protocol for eligibility 
purposes and is determined to meet eligibility criteria, as determined by the study team.  These 
individuals are sent to the ICU attending clinician to review and either APPROVE or DENY. Individuals who are assigned this status must be noted on the screening log.  
• Approved: defined as any patient who is RELEASED by the study team for clinician review and 
is ultimately determined to meet eligibility criteria and is appropriate for recruitment, as 
determined by the ICU attending clinician. Individuals who are assigned this status must be noted on the screening log.  
o Note: should the ICU attending opt out of approving each patient/family dyad for 
recruitment within the web application  the study team will automatically “approve” the 
patient/family dyad and attempt consent.  
• Denied: defined as any patient who is RELEASED by the study team for clinician review and is 
ultimately determined to not meet eligibility criteria and is not appropriate for recruitment, as 
determined by the ICU attending clinician.  Individuals who are assigned this status must be 
noted on the screening log.  
• Consented: defined as any  patient who is both R ELEASED and APPROVED, their  family 
member  is approached for consent , and voluntarily chooses to consent to the study, the 
 
Protocol Version: 5.1   Dated: 13 June  2022  Page 13 of 42 
 procedures, risks and benefits with the understanding that they may withdraw at any time. A signed/dated informed consent must be on record to account for this individual. Family 
members  who reach this status will be required to complete survey 1 ( T1) within 72 hours of 
informed consent.  Individuals  who are assigned this status must be noted on the enrollment log. 
• Refused: defined as any patient who is  both RELEASED and APPROVED, their family member 
was approached for consent, but  opted to not consent and therefore participate in the study. 
Patients who are assigned this status must be noted on the screening log. 
• Randomized : defined as any family member who’s loved one has the statuses of RELEAS ED, 
APPROVED, and CONSENTED, the family member  completes T1 survey , and continues to  
meet all eligibility criteria. Family members  who reach this status will be required to interact with 
the app three additional times (i.e., completion of T2, T3, and T4) . Additionally, if the family is 
randomized to Arm 1, they will be required to participate in at least one family meeting 
conducted by the ICU attending. Patients and family members  who are assigned this status 
must be maintained on the enrollment log.  
o Responder : defined as any family member who is randomized to the intervention arm 
and upon completing survey 2 (T2) received a NEST score of < 25 and their survey 2 
(T2) score is less than their survey 1 (T1) score. Individuals who are assigned this study status will not receive a Palliative Care consult by the Palliative Care clinician. Only the 
ICU attending will be able to view the survey results.  
o Non-responder : defined as any family member who is randomized to the intervention 
arm and upon completing survey 2 (T2) received a NEST score of >25 or their survey 2 
(T2) score is greater than their survey 1 (T1) score. Individuals who are assigned this study status are  to receive a Palliative Care consult by the Palliative Care clinician. The 
family member’s survey results will be viewed by both the ICU attending and the Palliative Care clinician.  
• Screen Failed:  defined as any family member  who was consented to the study, completes  
survey 1 ( T1), but  DOES NOT rec eive a NEST score of ≥ 10 on completion of survey 1 (T1) . 
Patients and their family members who are assigned this status must be maintained on the 
enrollment log.   
• Withdraw by PI or Self:  defined as any family member  who voluntarily consents to participate 
in the study, but is then withdrawn from the study. The PI may withdraw a participate at any time without their consent if the PI deems it is in their best interest to no longer participate OR the 
individual  demonstrates lack of compliance with study protocol and study procedures. Family 
members  who reach this status have no additional follow- ups or study requirements ; no further 
clinical data will be abstracted fro m the patient’s EMR.  Patients and family members  who are 
assigned this status must be maintained on the enrollment log.  
• Lost to Follow -Up (LTF):  defined as any family member who voluntarily consents to participate 
in the study but after non -compliance and at least 3 documented, attempted contacts 
appropriately spaced 1 -5 days apart, the family member  will be considered LTF. Patients and 
family members  who reach this status have no additional follow- ups or study requirements. 
Patients  and family members  who are assigned this status must be maintained on the 
enrollment log.  
o A family member  who returns the study team’s contacts within 1 week of last attempted 
contact may resume study participation.  
o A family member who has completed at least T1, T2, and T3 will be included in the 
overall target enrollment, even if deemed LTF for  T4.  
• Completed:  defined as any family member  who both consented and randomized to the study 
and completed T1 -T4 (or at least 75% of the surveys) . Family members and patients  who reach 
this status have no additional follow -up or study requirements. Family members and patients  
who are assigned this status must be maintained on the enrollment log.

Study data collection  
Each consented family member  will be asked to complete  four surveys, as well as up to two meetings 
(for intervention group participants) .  Appendix 4 shows the timeline and acceptable time frames within 
which survey responses are allowed.   Note that some latitude is provided given the possibility for 
weekends, etc.  
• Baseline,  Survey  1 (Day 1; up to 3 days allowed post -consent ): this will occur generally on 
the day of consent.  At this time , the following will occur: 
o App Registration 
o Survey 1 (T1) Completion 
o Randomization (if eligible)  
• ICU Family Meeting  for intervention group : The ICU attending will initiate  a one- on-one 
family meeting to discuss the reported family needs. This is to occur prior to the completion of 
Survey 2 (T2).  
• Survey 2: (Day 4; up to 4 days allowed post -randomization ) 
• Need- focused Palliative Care Family Meeting for intervention group: As noted above, this 
meeting will be triggered by a family member’s T2 NEST score that is either ≥25 or higher than 
their T1 NEST score.  The ICU attending and the Palliative Care team will meet with the family 
member together if at all possible to discuss the reported family needs. This meeting is to occur prior to the completion of Survey 3 (T3).  
• Survey 3: (Day 8 up to 4 days allowed ) 
• Survey 4: (Day 90; up to 28 days  allowed ) 
 
At each specified time point above, the study team will abstract, as needed, relevant clinical data, as 
defined in the study EDC manual of procedures (MOP) and enter into the EDC, REDCap.  
 Compensation  
Compensation for study participation will be provided to each family member  via Greenphire. Participan ts 
may receive up to a total of $60 for study completion:  
• T1: $15.00  
• T2: $15.00  
• T3: $15.00  
• T4: $15.00  
   
Compensation for study participants in aims 1 and 3 will also be provided. Participants who partake in 
aim 1 or 3 will receive a one- time payment of $15.00 for the completion of the single study visit.  
 
6.  Subject Participation Duration:   For those subjects enrolled in Aim s 1 and 3, we anticipate their study 
participation consisting of only one study survey , which will last for 30 -60 minutes. For the RCT (Aim 2), it 
will require 3 months for participants to complete the entire study from the time of randomization, including 
the intervention and all the follow up surveys.  
 
7.  Enrollment sites  
This study will be conducted at Duke University Health (DUH) , Duke Regional Hospital (DRH) , and Duke 
Raleigh Hospital —all sites within the Duke University Health System .  
 8.  Statistical Design, Analyses, Sample Size and P ower  
Statistical Design and Analyses Plan  
Aim 1  
 
Protocol Version: 5.1   Dated: 13 June  2022  Page 15 of 42 
 After programming is complete, the study team will  determine PCplanner usability using a ‘system -user-
task-environment’ mixed- methods approach.1,5,19,26- 28  The study team will interviews with healthy 
volunteers to determine app usability. During the single 30- minute sessions participants will complete: a 
‘think aloud’ protocol in which CRCs record comments as PCplanner is used;30 a semi -structured 
interview, and the 10 -item (0 [lowest] to 100 [highest]) industry -standard Systems Usability Scale 
(SUS).31  App revisions that address the needs of all users.32  The study team anticipate 2 -3 cycles of 
5-10 users each will achieve our testable hypothesis that PCplanner will attain a mean SUS score >6 0 
('excellent' usability).  33,34  
 
Aim 2  
We will test the primary study hypothesis that the NEST score is lower (i.e., fewer unmet needs) for 
intervention family caregivers compared to usual care at T3 (~ 1-week  post-randomization).  All 
participants will be analyzed as part of the group they were assigned, regardless of adherence or 
crossover status (i.e., intention to treat).   We will use a general linear model to estimate mean NEST 
changes and corresponding confidence intervals over time using SAS PROC MIXED (SAS Institute, Cary NC).  Different correlation structures will be examined (e.g., unstructured, autoregressive) and 
model fit indices will be used to guide the choice of the final  model’s structure.  
 Analyses similar to those conducted for the NEST (primary outcome analyses) above will be performed 
for the secondary family caregiver hypotheses involving PHQ -9, GAD -7, and PTSS scores at T3 and 
T4.  While family caregivers will be interviewed at T4 regardless of patient survival, patient death could complicate the analyses in two key ways: (1) Presence of missing data due to family loss to follow up 
(i.e., non -random missing data) and (2) differences in family caregiver distress by patient survival status  
(i.e., heterogeneous effect).
35  To address the impact of patient death on outcomes, after first exploring 
reasons for and predictors of dropout, we will conduct a 2- step supplemental analysis.  In Step 1, 
missing T4 data due to loss to follow up among family caregivers of survivors will be multiply imputed 
via SAS PROC MI.  In Step 2, we will account for T4 outcomes that are missing due to death via 
composite endpoint and principal stratification methods to estimate the causal effects of the intervention 
in the presence of these unidentified outcomes and complicated missing data patterns.36,37  For the key 
patient outcome, receipt of goal concordant care, we will use logistic regression models adjusting for 
the stratification variables, to examine if rates at T3 differ by treatment group.  The key healthcare 
systems outcome, post -randomization hospital length of stay (LOS), provides a unique challenge due to 
the high expected mortality rate (40- 50%).  In addition to descriptive analyses, steps to examine 
treatment group LOS differences will include: (1) a proportional hazards model with death treated as a 
censoring event; (2) a chi -square test of mortality rate differences; and (3) a Brunner- Manzel rank test 
for the composite death- LOS outcome.  This last step implements a recently developed methodology of 
a composite outcome that incorporates a numerical value for death (i.e., coded as the worst possible outcome or the longest possible stay) in the observed LOS distribution.
38,39 
 
Aim 3  
Transcribed interviews will be analyzed using a content analysis technique that combines structural  
(e.g., intervention component, palliative care process barriers) and magnitude coding (e.g., theme 
intensity) with inductive coding (e.g., variations in outcomes not captured by instruments).40  The study 
team will separately code 10 interviews, discuss the generated codes, and create an initial code book 
by consensus.  The code book will then be used by the study team for the next 10 transcribed 
interviews (with the PI  coding each 5th interview).  The final code book will be organized into categories 
used to generate themes of mechanistic and process elements.  Narrative case summaries will be 
constructed and matrixed by patient case using qualitative  analytic themes and quantitative data (e.g.,  
triggers, needs, psychological distress, app use analytics).  Across -case comparisons will be made 
using meta- matrices to search for patterns in intervention mechanisms of action common across 
theoretically - and empirically -derived categories of cases.41  Next, process tracing will be used to 
 
Protocol Version: 5.1   Dated: 13 June  2022  Page 16 of 42 
 explore how particular outcomes (e.g., needs, distress, goal concordance) may have been related to 
intervention components and their effect on process barriers in our conceptual model.42,43   
 Sample Size and Power    
Calculations were conducted via the mixed models with the differences in slopes option in PASS 2020 (Kayesville, UT).  With a total of 130 participants at 8 days (n=65 per treatment arm), we will have 80% power to detect a differential NEST improvement between treatment groups of 8.80 units at 8 days 
(SD=21.1, ρ=0.64 between baseline and 8 days based on pilot data and an additional ongoing trial 
[[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]]).  To account for 10% dropout by 8 days, we plan to consent and randomize 150 
participants (n=75 pe r treatment arm).   This sample size will also provide a power of 80% ( Type -I error of 
5%, dropout rates as noted above) to detect a 2.33- unit PHQ -9 change (SD=5.3, ρ =0.6) at 8 days —far 
smaller even that it’s  5.0-unit MCID.  These estimates are based on our pilot work as well as an ongoing 
RCT ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) we are conducting that uses the NEST  
9.  Study Duration:   As this project is centered around Aim 2, it is anticipated that  from the time the clinical 
trial opens to enrollment it will require ~41 months to complete data collection (~36 months for cumulative 
enrollment with 4 -5 months to complete all long- term follow up; this time does not include start up and 
analyses) and 4- 6 months to perform all final data analyses for all Aims.  
 10.  Risk- Benefit Assessment  
Potential risks    
Overall, this project is minimal risk. However, it is possible that participants could experience a breach 
of confidentiality should their records be accessed unlawfully by an outside party.  Also, it is possible that participants may experience mild anxiety when answering survey questions, though this has not 
been observed in similar interventions  including the multiple pilot studies on which this trial is based .  It 
is believed that involvement  in this study will present no significant physical, psychological, financial, 
legal, or other risks.  Additionally, there is always the potential of a breach of data security  given that 
this project involves the use of a web application developed by external vendors, One Cow Standing, 
LLC located in Durham, NC.    
 Adequacy of protection against risks   
Recruitment and informed consent procedures.   
First, the Duke Institutional Review Board (IRB) will review and approve the study protocol before study initiation. Informed consent (e- consent or written) will be required from all participants, including content 
experts.  Second, we will use a novel, Duke Health Technology Services (DHTS) and Office of Information Technology (OIT) developed, secured screening method that integrates the EMR and the novel web 
application. The API developed respects participant privacy and rights.  The study team will only approach 
those family members  that are deemed appropriate for the study, which will be determined by individual patient 
EMR review and subsequent approval by the ICU clinician via the web application. The approach of family 
members , will be aided by a short IRB -approved recruitment video found at PCplanner.duke.edu . The study 
team will then ask the family member  to read and sign the study consent form at the time of enrollment.  
Potential subjects will be given as much time as they need to consider study participation. A copy of the 
consent form will be given to participant and the original maintained in a secure location at the study site.   
 Protections against risk   
General oversight    
There are several ongoing mechanisms for monitoring the occurrence of adverse events  and other 
unanticipated problems related to research activity. The PI or delegated study team member will perform day -
to-day monitoring of the study activities. Careful monitoring of all persons entering the study will minimize 
attrition and will ensure the clinical safety of these patients.  This monitoring is facilitated by a telephone 
 
Protocol Version: 5.1   Dated: 13 June  2022  Page 17 of 42 
 number for the study team and an email address ( pcplanner @duke.edu) provided to participants upon entry 
into the study to report concerns related to study participation.  
 
Plans to prevent coercion of patients and to ensure voluntary participation 
The study team will strive to create an environment free of any coercive practices for patients, the family 
members and the participating clinicians. The study team will stress that study involvement is absolutely voluntary and that choosing to participate or not participate will not affect their care in anyway. In addition, the 
study team will utilize the standardized 2 -minute informational video, which has been used successfully in past 
trials describe treatment groups and ensure a similar approach across  sites.   
 Specific longitudinal participant oversight plans for severe psychological distress (including suicidal ideation)  
Given the difficult situations faced by family members who have loved ones in an ICU environment, it is  
recognized that there is a slight risk that some participants may become distressed completing questionnaires 
or viewing study materials, as mentioned above.  Additionally, given the extreme stresses of the critical illness 
experience, participants may even endorse suicidal ideation (SI).   
 The study team will take the following measures to effectively manage any serious distress that occurs:  
 
(1)  All of the in -person and telephone- based data collection sessions will be conducted by trained study team 
members who are sensitive to the issues that arise.  
 
(2) Study team members will emphasize to participants that any interviews or other study interactions are 
participant -controlled.  Thus, participants will be instructed that they are in control over what they share and 
generally how long they discuss any topic that is addressed.   
 
(3)  Participants will be told that they can discontinue an interview or telephone session at any time and that they are also free to reschedule an interview or treatment session at any time within the week.   
 
(4)  There is also a potential risk for identifying underlying mental health issues through the survey responses.  
For issues such as passive suicidal ideation or symptoms of depression, anxiety, or PTSD, an informational sheet will be provided with contact numbers for additional mental health services.   
 
(5) As a safety measure, used in past and current ICU -based clinical research, the study team will monitor 
participants closely beyond just the parameters of questionnaire scores.  The study staff will monitor 
participants closely during any interviews performed and will refer those with any concerning level of emotional 
distress and/or relationship distress to  the PIs to evaluate by phone or in person.  This will be done 
immediately, particularly if there is staff concern about a participant who indicates suicidality.  
 
All study participants will be informed of the  suicidality response plan prior to signing the informed consent for 
their participation in the study. The PI or study team delegate(s) will complete the online Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C -SSRS) training, a 30- minute interactive slide presentation followed by a question-
answer session.  The C -SSRS is a scale that can delineate high, moderate, and low -risk levels.   
 
Suicidality Response Plan  
The Suicidality Response Plan can be activated if the study team  have in- person or telephone interactions that 
concern them , deeming the participant as ‘high risk .’  Additionally, ‘high risk’ participants are defined as those 
who reply to the PHQ -9’s question #9  regarding suicidal ideation with any response indicating a frequency of 
such ideation measured in days other than ‘never’ PLUS responding ‘yes’ to a branching logic item that follows 
any such ‘positive’ response to item #9 that determines if the individual has an active suicidality plan .  
 
 
Protocol Version: 5.1   Dated: 13 June  2022  Page 18 of 42 
 If the participant is deemed to be at high risk  of active suicidality , the app system will send an alert email and/or 
text message in real time to the study manager, the study coordinator(s) and the PI s (no PHI included, only 
study ID).   
 
One of these study staff will then contact the participant. Contact is to occur as soon as possible (and definitely 
within 24 hours of learning of the event ).  Using the full C- SSRS, the trained staff will then help to assess the 
participant to determine if they endorse active suicidal ideation.  The trained staff will also determine if the 
participant is currently being treated by a mental health professional .  
 If the participant is considered to be actively suicidal then at least one of the following plans will be followed 
depending on the location of the participant for each of the following situations:  
 
• Situation 1  
o If the participant is with one of the study personnel, the study personnel will notify the PIs 
immediately.  
o The study personnel will either physically walk the subject to the emergency department, or call a Psychiatric Emergency services number relevant to the site as described above.  
 
• Situation 2  
o If the participant is on the telephone:  
 The study personnel will notify the PIs immediately  
 The study personnel will stay on the telephone with the subject participant.  
 The study personnel will immediately contact 911 to initiate an on -site rescue if such 
action is clinically  indicated.  
o The study personnel will stay on the telephone with the subject until EMS services have contacted the participant.  
 
• Situation 3:  
o If there are any active suicidal concerns in any of the surveys (e.g., PHQ -9 above), an email, or 
in a text message:  
 The study data system will notify the PIs and Study Manager in real time of any PHQ -9 
suicidality item positively endorsed.   
 The study personnel will then contact the honest broker to de- identify the participant 
information.   
 Next, the study personnel (or a PI; whoever is able first) will contact the participant by telephone.  
 The study personnel or PI will stay on the telephone with the subject participant  
 The study personnel or PI will use a different telephone line to immediately contact 911 
to initiate an on -site rescue if action is clinically indicated.  
 The study personnel or PI will stay on the telephone with the subject until EMS services 
have contacted the participant.  
 If the participant if determined to be actively suicidal and require immediate medical therapy, they will be 
withdrawn from the study.  
 
If the family member is deemed not to be actively suicidal, they will be given a list of local mental health 
resources within the app platform’s screen as follows:  
 
• Duke:  Call Emergency Psychiatry at (919) 681 -4410 or (919) 681 -1316, available 24 hours a day, 7 
days a week.  
 
Protocol Version: 5.1   Dated: 13 June  2022  Page 19 of 42 
 • The National Suicide Prevention Lifeline - 1- 800-273-TALK (8255) is a free, 24 -hour hotline available to 
anyone in suicidal crisis or emotional distress. 
 As described above, all concerns about participant safety will be discussed immediately with the PI s - including 
concerning severe distress that does not involve suicidality.   
 
For these situations, once an “alert situation” is known, the PIs will refer the participant if needed (based on a 
PI-led phone call) to local psychological resources. The study team will also make urgent and emergency 
referrals as needed based on information learned.  
 
To date, in previously completed similar studies, analysis has found that <5% of participants  will require a call 
from the study team  during some point in the study period.  Of those, none have required referral to acute 
psychiatric care after a detailed interview from the study team.  After a disposit ion/solution has been made, 
both the resolution (and follow up) will be documented in the ‘contact log’ section of the data system for 
reporting to the DSMB.   
 
Patient  Death While in Study  
Finally , it is recognized that this project targets patients who are  critically ill and elderly, therefore, there is a 
risk of death.  The study team will review the EMR to look for records of death, halting all study procedures , if 
applicable, and noting the date of death. Additionally, on phoning any family member, the study team will 
initiate a conversation to tactfully ascertain the patient’s vital status . If the patient has died, we will provide brief 
support.  If a family member  states that they wish to drop out, the study team will respect that as well. A follow -
up question may be asked to ascertain the reason for withdraw; however, this is for documentation purposes only.  
 Vulnerable P opulations  
The study team not enroll patients from vulnerable populations (e.g., imprisoned persons, minors). 
However, elderly patients will be targeted for enrollment into this project, and therefore, there is a 
potential risk of death due to their age and critical illness in < 3 months.  
 
Potential Benefits  
This randomized clinical trial will compare PCplanner to a  usual care control condition. The PCplanner 
intervention may reduce unmet needs and psychological distress, increase goal concordance, and reduce length of stay. Therefore, this intervention could hold great promise for helping many others in 
similar situations in the future. However, this is not certain.  In fact, subjects in the usual care control 
condition may experience similar or even greater benefits to those described for PCplanner. Then 
again, they may receive no particular benefit. Nonetheless, study involvement puts subjects at low risk 
for any adverse physical or psychological risk. Therefore, the potential benefits for participation justify the minimal risk to those enrolled in the proposed study.  Financial compensation will not be emphasized as a benefit of participation in research.  
 11. Adverse Events (AEs), Serious Adverse Events, (SAEs), Protocol Deviations (PDs) and 
Unanticipated Problems (UPs).    
As noted above, this is considered a minimal risk study. Since the project intends to enroll critically ill patients who are elderly, and therefore, at risk of multiple and significant comorbidities, hospitalizations, and even 
death, adverse and serious adverse events will be limited to events that directly affect the overall well- being 
and safety of the family member (research subject). Additionally, given that this is a self -directed, survey based 
study, it is anticipated that compliance of research subjects (family member or clinician) will be less than 100% 
and/or completed within the protocol window. As such, events related to incomplete or missed study procedures will not be considered a protocol deviation and therefore will not be reported to the institutional or 
 
Protocol Version: 5.1   Dated: 13 June  2022  Page 20 of 42 
 sponsor officials. Rather, events occurring outside of the study protocol will be documented and recorded by 
the study team in the web application, EDC, and/or study source documents as applicable.    
 All participants will have access to the principal investigator’s  contact information 24 hours a day (shown in the 
consent form).  If a telephone interview is required, it will be conducted by a trained study team member who has been trained to be sensitive to the nature of these issues.   
 
Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)  
Adverse events (AEs) generally would include extremely high distress levels (PHQ -9 score >25, GAD -7 
score >20, PTSS score >34) or active suicidal ideation (i.e., endorsement of PHQ -9 suicidal ideation 
item plus a positive response to a branching logic item  signifying active planning that would follow 
inquiring about a plan).  A serious adverse event (SAE) would be a suicide attempt, a hospitalization, or death.   
 It is anticipated, in this study, for AEs to be extremely uncommon as it is a behavioral study. However, it is 
possible that participants could exhibit signs of and/or experience suicidal ideations with intent or thoughts of 
intent to act on such ideations. No other event, outside of suicidal ideation with intent or thoughts of intent to 
act on ideations will be considered an AE for this trial.  
 
Like, AEs, it is not anticipated that SAEs will occur. However, for this study, an SAE would include a suicide 
attempt, a hospitalization  (of family member) , or death (of family member) . All serious adverse events will be 
reported within the standard timelines required to the IRB, study sponsor, and/or DSMB, as appropriate and when applicable.  
 
Protocol Deviations (PDs) and Unanticipated Problems (UPs)  
Protocol deviations are errors made by study staff or deviations from plan made by study clinicians such as failure to conduct a family meeting.  Unanticipated problems could consist of issues such as 
failure of the study staff to respond in a timely manner to suicidal ideation reported by a participant.  
 
Given the nature of this study, it is anticipated that most enrolled family members will not complete their 
study surveys within the assigned protocol window. Additionally, it is expected that surveys may be 
missed as these are self -reported outcomes. As such, these will not be considered protocol deviations. 
Should other protocol deviations or unanticipated problems occur, they will be discussed with the PI, documented, and reported to the IRB, study  sponsor, and/or DSMB, as appropriate and when 
applicable.  
 
Period and Frequency for Event Assessment and Follow -Up 
Protocol deviations and other unanticipated problems, as well as AEs and SAEs, will be recorded in the 
data collection system throughout the study.  
 The study team will record all reportable events with start dates occurring any time after informed 
consent is obtained until 7 days after the last day of study participation.  At each study survey , the study 
team will inquire by way of verbal or written request and/or EMR review, of the occurrence of AE/SAEs since the last survey .  Events will be followed for outcome information until resolution or stabilization. 
 
Characteristics of an Adverse or Serious Adverse Event  
Relationship to Study Intervention  
To assess relationship of an event to study intervention, the following guidelines are used:  
• Definitely Related:  The definition of an AE/SAE that is definitely related would include episodic distress triggered by either a study survey or some study material (e.g., a video).   
 
Protocol Version: 5.1   Dated: 13 June  2022  Page 21 of 42 
 • Possibly Related :  The definition of an AE/SAE that is possibly related would include simply 
experiencing high levels of distress during the trial period.  That is, this could follow a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the study intervention, but that could readily have been produced by a number of other factors. 
• Not Related:  An AE/SAE that is not related would include a hospitalization for a car accident, etc.  That is, it would be an adverse event that is clearly not related to the investigational 
agent/procedure - i.e. another cause of the event is most plausible; and/or a c linically plausible 
temporal sequence is inconsistent with the onset of the event and the study intervention and/or a causal relationship is considered biologically implausible.   
 
Expectedness  
• Unexpected – The definition of an unexpected AE/SAE will be one whose nature or severity of 
the event is not consistent with information about the condition under study or intervention in the protocol, consent form, product brochure, or investigator brochure.  
• Expected - There are no events known to be associated with the intervention.  Psychological 
distress is expected given the severity of patients’ illnesses and their family members’ 
involvement in decision making about a life- threatening illness.  
 Severity  
The following scale will be used to grade adverse events:  
1. Mild: no intervention required; no impact on activities of daily living (ADL).  For example, elevated distress levels (e.g., PHQ -9 score >25, GAD -7 score >20, PTSS score >34).  
2. Moderate: minimal, local, or non- invasive intervention indicated; moderate impact on ADL. For 
example, suicidal ideation endorsed (i.e., PHQ -9 item #9), though no plan endorsed.  
3. Severe: significant symptoms requiring invasive intervention; subject seeks medical attention, 
needs major assistance with ADL.  For example, suicide attempt, hospitalization due to distress 
symptoms, or death.  
 
Reporting Procedures  
Adverse and Serious Adverse Events  
We have a strong plan for AE/SAE reporting and follow up.  First, we have a very robust monitoring system for psychiatric and emotional symptoms.  We will know ‘alert’ values of depression, anxiety, and 
PTSD symptoms the second a questionnaire is completed via the mobile app.  For symptoms that are 
either great in total burden (i.e., total score is high), we will call the participant to check in.  For specific symptoms such as the suicidal ideation item in the PHQ -9 depression questionnaire, we will also call 
the participant and assess the severity of the situation, triaging them as appropriate to psychiatric 
support.  Last, we have broadly placed our email addresses and phone numbers in all study materials 
and will encourage people to contact us regarding any issues.  
 Since this is a psychosocial intervention, we do not expect study related physical issues to occur.  
Furthermore, there is no lab work  involved.   
 
All deaths will be reported to NIA Program Officer, the DSMB Chair, and the central IRB within 72 hours 
of study’s knowledge of death.  For each patient who dies, a brief report containing the following 
variables will be provided:  
Age 
Principal diagnosis  
Number of comorbidities  
Admission APACHE II score  
Days since enrollment  
 
Protocol Version: 5.1   Dated: 13 June  2022  Page 22 of 42 
 Brief description of circumstances surrounding death including expected or unexpected.  
 
All adverse events  that are both  serious (SAE) and unexpected  (i.e., have not been previously 
reported for the study’s intervention) will be reported to the IRB, NIA PO, and to the independent data and safety monitoring body according to the timeframe displayed in appendix 6. The summary of all 
other SAEs should be reported to NIA PO and to the DSMB or a Safety Officer, if either is appointed, quarterly, unless otherwise requested by the DSMB or a Safety Officer.  
 Serious (fatal or life -threatening) SAEs that are unanticipated (i.e., not listed in the Data and Safety 
Monitoring Plan) and that are related to the intervention will be reported to the NIH Program Officer and to the DSMB Chair according to the timeframe displayed in appendix 6 .   
 
The summary of all other SAEs will be reported to NIH Program Officer and to the DSMB quarterly, 
unless otherwise requested by the DSMB.  Additionally, for SAEs, we will hold an all -investigator 
teleconference within 7 days.  The PIs will draft a description of the SAE 
and an action plan.  This will be 
passed on to the IRB, the NIH, and DSMB within 72 hours of the 
teleconference. See appendix 6 for 
identifying and reporting structure.    
Protocol Deviations and Other Unanticipated Problem Reporting  
Incidents or events that meet the reporting criteria, as outlined by the 
Duke IRB, will be reported to the 
Duke IRB as needed.  
 
The following will be included, at a 
minimum:  
• A detailed description of the event, incident, experience, or outcome;  
• A description of any changes to the protocol or other corrective actions that have been taken or are proposed in response to the unanticipated problem.  
 
12. Data & S afety Monitoring Plan 
Overall framework for safety monitoring and what information will be monitored  
The proposed trial will be monitored for safety using both automated / electronic means, as well as by human oversight.  The study data system will allow real -time monitoring of study participant distress 
levels, alerting study staff immediately with any participant report of suicidal ideation.  Human safeguards will include the study team, led by the experienced PIs, the Duke Institutional Review 
Board, and the study Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB).  All of these components are discussed in 
greater detail below.  The trial information monitored is shown in the Table . 
 
Plans for assurance of compliance regarding adverse event reporting.   
The study team will be required to document and report adverse events (including serious adverse events) to the Institutional Review Board (IRB), as appropriate and in line with institutional reporting criteria. Also, all 
adverse events are reported as part of NIH Progress Reports in the non- competitive and competitive renewals.

 The PI s will supervise the study, including data management, data accuracy, and protocol compliance.  The 
study biostatistician and Study Manager will be the chief data managers and will adhere to established federal 
and institutional patient safety and protection guidelines. To assure data accuracy, the Study Manager will 
review data system reports on a routine basis. These reports will show enrollment, missing data, and other 
values. Additionally, the Study Manager will process detailed reports to search for err ors and generate basic 
reports for dissemination for regular staff meetings.   
 Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB)  
This trial will be supervised by a single independent DSMB composed of professionals with significant experience in clinical trials, palliative care interventions, epidemiology, and biostatistics who are not 
directly involved in the study, its interpretation, or in current collaborative research with a study team member.   
 
The main responsibilities of the DSMB will be to (a) assess for the presence of potential harms and unintended consequences of the PCplanner intervention and usual care control, (b) ensure the validity and integrity of the data, and (c) make recommendations to the investigators and to the NIH about 
whether the trial should be continued without modification, continued with modification, or terminated.  
 
The initial DSMB meeting will occur before the initiation of subject enrollment for the purpose of updating members on the study, ensuring agreement on the review process, establishing the review 
methodology and procedures, ensuring all conflicts of interest are disclosed (to be reviewed by NIH 
staff), reviewing the protocol, and codifying a written DSMB charter.  The NIH's Data Safety Monitoring 
Plan (DSMP) Template will be used to guide the drafting of the charter.  This document will specify procedures for protocol amendments, ensuring participant confidentiality and privacy, ensuring 
database protection, coordinating center responsibilities, creating adverse outcome definitions (adverse 
events, unanticipated problems, and serious adverse events), protocol for reporting and responding to 
adverse events while also maintaining subject confidentiality, justifying sample size, assessing accrual 
and compliance, halting and stopping rules (drafted with the assistance of the DSMB chair and the 
DSMB lead statistic ian), approving informed consent documents, and guidelines for quality control and 
quality assurance.  Before enrollment begins, the DSMB charter will be approved by both the DSMB 
and the NIH; additionally, ClinicalTrials.gov registration will be finalized. 
 
The first DSMB data review will occur either after the first 50 participants have been enrolled—
representing approximately 25% of randomization target —or enrollment has occurred for 6 months, 
whichever is observed first.  Thereafter, the DSMB will review cleaned data reports (provided by the 
Study Manager 2 weeks before the DSMB meeting) every 6 months during enrollment and follow up 
and will prepare a report with any recommendations within 2 weeks following their review.  The specific 
study metrics that th e DSMB will review at each meeting include:  enrollment rate (noting race & 
ethnicity of those enrolled), retention rate (noting race & ethnicity of those who drop out), PHQ -9 
scores, GAD -7 scores, PTSS scores, and Adverse Events.  The primary safety measures will be 
Adverse Events reports and PHQ -9’s suicidal ideation item.  Other items reviewed by the DSMB at 
each meeting will include: (a) data quality, completeness, and timeliness; (b) performance of the individual sites; (c) adequacy of compliance with goals for recruitment and retention, including women 
and minorities; (d) protocol adherence; and (e) presence of factors that could adversely affect study 
outcome or compromise data confidentiality.  Study patients will be recovering from life- threatening 
illnesses managed in intensive care units which increase the likelihood of death overtime  in comparison 
to healthy individuals.  As such, any patient deaths and their cause during the follow up period will be recorded, discussed, and highly scrutinized.   
 The Study Manager, will provide written reports to DSMB members that do not name the treatment group.  The  study biostatistician, will oversee any DSMB statistical requests and interpretations.  During 
 
Protocol Version: 5.1   Dated: 13 June  2022  Page 24 of 42 
 the review process, formal statistical tests may be performed under DSMB supervision if requested 
(e.g., examining the differences in Adverse Event or outcome rates between factor -based groups).  
Additionally, the DSMB may request a formal statistical assessment if a suspicious increase in PHQ -9 
score is observed in any treatment group.  We do not plan interim analyses given the sample size of 
this trial.  If a specific group is found to have a statistically or clinically significant increase in mortality or 
PHQ -9 score, the DSMB scope of action may include recommendation for stopping the trial (see next 
paragraph).  For differences in study dropout rates, appropriate changes to the protocol will be made by PI consensus after DSMB member input.  Any protocol  changes, as well as any adverse events, will 
also be immediately reported to the Duke Institutional Review Board as well as to the project’s NIH Program Officer.  
 
As noted above, the DSMB will have the power to stop the trial at their discretion.  The following is a 
possible stopping plan that could be adapted by the study DSMB for inclusion in the final DSMB 
Charter.  Because this is an early phase trial, we will not have formal stopping rules based on efficacy 
or futility.  Criteria for intervention discontinuation and stopping based on safety concerns will be determined in partnership with the study DSMB and codified in the DSMB charter before enrollment 
begins.  We propose a strategy similar to that included in our past ICU- based RCTs that included family 
caregivers (e.g., R01 HL109823, PI: Cox ).  Three -month all -cause mortality will be the primary adverse 
event for the patients in study.  We will examine the distribution of deaths by treatment arm three times 
during the trial:  at 15, 25, and 50 deaths.  At each of these interim looks, we will examine the distribution of deaths by study group and conducted either a non -parametric sign test or Wilcoxon 
signed- rank test to test the difference in median number of deaths between the arms.  We will use 
Haybittle -Peto guidelines and stringently set the p -value at 0.001 to flag a significant difference 
between arms at each of these interim looks.  If this difference is observed, this would then indicate a closer examination of related constructs, as well as proximate causes and circumstances surrounding death (e.g., timing and location of death, withdrawal of life support or not, comorbidities and illness 
severity, clinician expectations of survival).  We will use the Patient -Centeredness of Care Scale to 
provide additional information on the alignment of patient treatment and values at the time of death.  Although past end of life interventions have not increased mortality, it is possible that by better focusing 
decision makers’ attention on patients’ values, higher mortality could be observed in the intervention group by identifying patients for whom prolonged life support would be a state worse than death 
(Patrick DL, et al. Ann Int Med. 139:410- 415, 2003; Holloway RG, et al. JAMA. 298:802 -804, 2007).  
Yet if PCplanner —a non -directive intervention—led to more decisions to forego life support, this would 
be ethically permissible if the treatments received reflected patient -centered care as assessed by the 
PCCS (Institute of Medicine, 2001; Lin GA, et al. Arch Intern Med. 169:1551- 1553, 2009; Holloway RG, 
et al. 2007).  The primary adverse event for family caregivers will be symptoms of psychological 
distress as measured by t he PHQ -9 and PTSS at T2 and T3.  We propose to examine the distribution 
of scores by treatment arm three times during the trial:  at 25, 75, and 100 caregivers.  Using methods 
similar to those above, we could examine circumstances more closely as per DSMB guidelines.   
 Frequency of Data and Safety Monitoring  
The proposed trial will be monitored extensively.  In real -time, all study staff will be made aware of any 
study participant who reports any suicidal ideation.  Routine reports on enrollment, adherence, dropout, 
and study progress will be generated by the study data system and then reviewed by the study team.  
All primary outcomes will be reviewed as well in a summary view (for the PI; group -based data will not 
be included) and a group -based view (for the DSMB; treatment group name will be removed).  The 
study DSMB will view data every 6 months.  Interim analyses, though not planned, will be conducted at 
the behest of the DSMB.  Our approach to stopping rules is discussed below in the context of the 
DSMB.  
 
 
Protocol Version: 5.1   Dated: 13 June  2022  Page 25 of 42 
 Safety Review Plan  
Study progress and safety will be reviewed routinely. Progress reports, including recruitment, retention 
and attrition, and AEs will be provided to the DSMB  semi -annually.  An Annual Report will be compiled 
and will include a list and summary of AEs.  In addition, the Annual Report will address (1) whether AE 
rates are consistent with pre- study assumptions; (2) reason for dropouts from the study; (3) whether all 
participants met entry criteria; (4) whether continuation of the study is justified on the basis  that 
additional data are needed to accomplish the stated aims of the study; and (5) conditions whereby the study might be terminated prematurely.  The Annual Report will be sent to the Independent Monitors 
and will be forwarded to the IRB and the study sponsor.  The IRB and other applicable recipients will 
review progress of this study on an annual basis . 
 
Quality Assurance and Confidentiality  
First, the PCplanner electronic data platform  “forces” responses to key questionnaire items (e.g., primary 
outcomes surveys) before allowing progression through the particular interview’s template, thereby minimizing missing data.  For less critical items, delayed data entry is possible (though these  data elements are non-
essential to primary aims analyses).  However, each time the study team logs into the secure data entry 
system, prompts appear on the welcome screen that show what data elements remain incomplete (as well as 
the time frame within whi ch they must be entered) for all site participants.   
 The study PI will ensure the validity of the data system by examining electronic summary case report forms 
within the data system to ensure adequacy and accuracy of data collection as well as transcription to the 
database itself after enrollment of the first 5 participants.  Agreement will be reviewed and discrepancies will be 
discussed.   
 
Safety Monitoring  
The proposed trial will be monitored for safety using both automated and electronic means, as well as 
by human oversight.  The study data system will allow real- time monitoring of study participant distress 
levels, alerting study staff immediately with any participant report of suicidal ideation.  Human safeguards will include the study team, led by the experienced PIs, the Duke Institutional Review 
Board, and the study Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB), as applicable per reporting criteria.  
 
Frequency of monitoring, including plans for interim analysis and stopping rules  
The proposed trial will be monitored extensively.  In real -time, all study staff will be made aware of any 
study participant who reports any suicidal ideation.  Routine reports on enrollment, adherence, dropout, 
and study progress will be generated by the study data system and then reviewed by the study team.  
All primary outcomes will be reviewed as well in a summary view (for the PI; group -based data will not 
be included) and a group -based view (for the DSMB; treatment group name will be removed).  The 
study DSMB will view data every 6 months . 
 
Safety Review Plan  
Study progress and safety will be reviewed monthly (and more frequently if needed).  Progress reports, including patient recruitment, retention/attrition, and AEs will be provided to the Independent Monitor(s) 
semi -annually.  An Annual Report will be compiled and will include a list and summary of AEs.  In 
addition, the Annual Report will address (1) whether AE rates are consistent with pre -study 
assumptions; (2) reason for dropouts from t he study; (3) whether all participants met entry criteria; (4) 
whether continuation of the study is justified on the basis that additional data are needed to accomplish 
the stated aims of the study; and (5) conditions whereby the study might be terminated prematurely.  
The Annual Report will be sent to the Independent Monitors and will be forwarded to the IRB and NIA.  The IRB and other applicable recipients will review progress of this study on an annual basis.

 Study Report Outline for the Independent Monitors(s) (Interim or Annual Reports)  
The study team will generate Study Reports for the Independent Monitor and will provide information on 
the following study parameters:  NEST, PHQ -9, GAD -7, and PTSS scores; enrollment success; rate of 
consent; rate of successful randomization; retention ra tes; and AE/SAEs.  Study Report tables will be 
generated only from aggregate (not by group assignment) baseline and aggregate safety data for the 
study population.  
 
Submission of On- Site Monitoring/Audit and Inspection Reports  
The IRB, IMC, and NIA Program Officials will receive copies of all study monitoring/audit or inspection 
reports within 14 day of PI receipt.   
 
Table A  
 Data management plan    
All study data will be entered by participants and delegated study team members via the PCplanner 
app and the REDCap  data system , as applicable.   Participant data entry will primarily utilize our tested, 
highly secure ePRO system  linked to the web application. The study team will abstract relevant clinical 
data from the EMR and input into the secure REDCap . The PCplanner mobile app backend will reside 
on a Duke University RHEL Server fronted by a ProxyPass pass  through server within Apache HTTPD.  
The central REDCap  database will run on  a mirrored Duke University server system with automatic fail -
over features and transaction logs.  Data will be backed up hourly on the Duke University server and 
archived four times daily on a mirror server managed by Duke Health Technology System (DHTS ). The 
app and data system will be built to security standards set by both the Duke Information Technology 
Security Office (ITSO) as well as DHTS; our programmatic partners, Duke ORI, have experience using 
this paradigm.  These standards enforce strict scheduled security patching of all digital resources .

Study Report Outline for the Independent Monitors(s) (Interim or Annual Reports)  
The study team will generate Study Reports for the DSMB  and will provide information on the following 
study parameters:  NEST, PHQ -9, GAD -7, and PTSS scores; enrollment success; rate of consent; rate 
of successful randomization; retention rates; and AE/SAEs.  Study Report tables will be generated for 
baseline and aggregate  safety data for the study population.  
 
Data handling and Record Keeping 
The study team is responsible for ensuring the accuracy, completeness, legibility, and timeliness of the 
data reported.  All source documents should be completed in a neat, legible manner to ensure accurate interpretation of data.  The study team will maintain adequate case histories of study subjects, including 
accurate case report forms (CRFs), and source documentation. The principal investigator will maintain 
overall oversight and responsibility of these activities.  
 Personal identifiers, such as name, date of birth, MRN, diagnoses, dates of admission and discharge, 
and other relevant clinical information for both patients, family members and the clinicians may be 
stored in the REDCap  study data system.  Data will be backed up hourly on the server and archived 
four times daily on a mirror server managed by the Duke Health Technology Solutions team.   
 13.  Data management  
All study data will be input by participants and CRCs via the PCplanner app (noting that the usual control group will do the same via the private study webpage, directly linked to the study RedCAP data system, without access to the PCplanner content).  Participant data entry will primarily utilize our tested, 
highly secure ePRO system linked to our data system.  The PCplanner mobile app Ansible backend 
and the RedCAP study data system will reside on a Duke University RHEL Server fronted by a 
ProxyPass pass through  server within Apache HTTPD.  The central RedCAP database will run on a 
mirrored Duke University server system with automatic fail -over features and transaction logs.  Data will 
be backed up hourly on the Duke University server and archived four times daily on a mirror server managed by Duke Health Technology System (DHTS), a technical partner in this R01 project. The app 
and data system will be built to security standards set by both the Duke Information Technology 
Security Office (ITSO) as well as DHTS; our programmatic partners, Duke ORI, have experience using 
this paradigm.  These standards enforce strict scheduled security patching of all digital resources.  Routine summative (i.e., not group- based) reports will be generated and reviewed by the study team to 
monitor enrollment and retention, safety indices, and missing data.   
 
14. Privacy, Data Storage & Confidentiality  
Privacy  
We believe that risks to privacy associated with study participation will be low based on the steps we 
plan to take closely safeguard participant privacy, protected health information (PHI; see also next section), and personal information.  Study ID numbers, generated randomly  at the time of enrollment, 
and are  linked in a separate RedCAP subsystem patient names and medical record numbers.  Further, 
names, birthdates, telephone numbers, addresses, and medical record numbers are only viewable by 
the study te am after entry of a unique username/password combination changed every 3 months.  The 
master list of study ID linkage to this personal data will be deleted after study completion.  The RedCAP 
system stores all data on a secure Duke University server with a sophisticated dual backup system.  No 
PHI is visible in any ePRO user interface (with the exception of the clinician user interface, which will 
show room number and patient last name— the minimal PHI that would still allow recognition).  Study 
participants  cannot view data via the ePRO system, only enter data (a 'one- way view').  Participants 
access this one -way view ePRO system via secure, PHI -free email or text links sent from our study 
RedCAP data system.   
 
Protocol Version: 5.1   Dated: 13 June  2022  Page 28 of 42 
  
 
Should participant privacy be compromised despite our attention to Duke Information Technology 
Security Office (ITSO) protocols, we will quickly assess the data exposed, disclose this immediately to 
all affected participants, and offer the assistance of the Duke ITSO in managing the breach.  The 
impact  of a privacy breach is difficult to quantify, though could be distressing (phone number, address).  
For this reason, the study team will make every effort to first prevent such a breach first and foremost.  
 Confidentiality  
Subjects will not be identified on any study reports.  University firewalls, multiple passwords, and encryption programs protect the security of the electronic data entry system, which will be housed on a highly secure Duke University server.  All personal  computers are located in lockable offices and are accessible only by 
frequently changed passwords.  The server room is accessible only to designated University Systems Administrators.   
 
Protected Health Information (PHI)
 
Duke University endeavors to build technological solutions that preserve the privacy, confidentiality, and security of protected health information (PHI) that may be part of health records or research datasets.  PHI is handled according to appropriate Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act 
of 1996 (HIPAA) Privacy and Security Regulations.  Duke programmers and Duke Research staff who 
work with sensitive data are required to complete appropriate HIPAA training with periodic updates, complete human subjects and data privacy training, comply with site IT Security Policies, and agree to 
the provisions of the university Rules of Behavior and Sanction Policy.  Duke strives to implement reasonable security controls in its product builds guided by the Federal Information Security 
Management Act  (FISMA), HIPAA, and Appendix III of the OMB Circular A -130.  
 Of the 18 PHI elements, the study will collect the following at minimum: name (identification), address 
(to send surveys and/or remuneration), date of birth (to calculate age), telephone number and email address (to contact with surveys), social security number (collected only from those who wish to receive 
remuneration, as per Duke policy regarding payment reporting to Federal agencies), medical record 
number of patient (identification), and use of unique PCplanner web URLs through which data are 
collected in our ePRO system (per Duke / DHTS / ITSO security policy).  The study team will enter 
some of these data into our study data system, while family caregivers will enter others.  The PHI 
collected from clinicians includes, but may not be limited to, their name, area of medical focus, age, and 
relevant sociodemographic information. No PHI is ever visible in any app user interface seen by family caregivers. The PHI displayed in the PCplanner app includes the patient’s last name, bed number, 
MRN, date of admi ssion, and palliative care trigger(s).  
 
 
Digital security  
The study digital infrastructure consists of a mobile web app browser with an integrated electronic patient reported outcomes (ePRO) function designed by One Cow Standing, LLC (Durham, NC), a 
research system ‘backend’ which interfaces with the EMR, and a REDCap study data system .  The 
security features are in line and supported by Duke’s Information Technology Security Office (ITSO), the Duke Health Technology Solutions (DHTS) frameworks, HIPAA, and Duke IRB standards.  Per 
DHTS standards, security updates and patches for the PCplanner web app will be required on a weekly basis.  Our digital systems are also protected up by the Duke University firewall system and monitored 
24 hours a day by DHTS digital security technicians.  
 Private study website  
Study staff and participants will access the online elements through separate secure pathways hosted, 
monitored, and maintained by Duke University under the general domain of PC planner.duke.edu.  
 
Protocol Version: 5.1   Dated: 13 June  2022  Page 29 of 42 
 Study staff will use their University credentials to login in a process identical in security strength to EHR 
login (i.e., Shibboleth multi- factor authentication).  The complete PCplanner system, after development 
by the Duke Office of Research Informatics  (ORI) team and the study team, will be hosted within the 
secure Duke University Internal Digital Environment and will be composed of an app subserver (app 
interface, content, ePRO system), the study REDCap database, and system files (e.g., scripts, code, 
HTML, images).  
 
PCplanner Mobile Web Application The study team opted for a mobile web application versus a native app such as one downloads from an 
app store because of its enhanced security.  Web applications always have the most recent version, 
allowing security patches to be pushed out at any time.  In contrast, native apps require the user to update their app periodically —a process that many users simply do not do regularly, making the app 
more vulnerable to security breaches.  The programming service providers, One Cow Standing, endeavor to build technological solutions that preserve the privacy, confidentiality, and security of 
protected health information that may be part of health records or research datasets.  Protected Health 
Information (PHI) is handled according to appropriate Health Insurance  Portability and Accountability 
Act of 1996 (HIPAA) Privacy and Security Regulations.  All staff who work with sensitive data are 
required to complete appropriate HIPAA training with periodic updates, complete human subjects and 
data privacy training, comply with site IT Security Policies, and agree to the provisions of the University 
Rules of Behavior and Sanction Policy.  Duke, and by extension Duke ORI, strives to implement 
reasonable security controls in its product builds guided by FISMA, HIPAA, and OM B Circular A -130, 
Appendix III.  
 
Data security is of the upmost importance for the study, particularly in providing a digital, online intervention for the participants.  Beyond the robust security that REDCap provides, One Cow Standing 
developers have implemented and maintains several security protocols and controls for apps as well.  
Duke ORI has developed a formal information security program, with a named individual responsible for 
its overall execution.  Duke ORI also periodically conducts an information technology (IT) security risk 
assessment on its projects, maintains formal documented protocols for reporting security breaches, 
assesses and manages security risks associated with vendors and subcontractors, maintains employee 
on-boarding and off -boarding policies that protect study data and integrity, and ensures continuing 
employee awareness of and education on security policies, standards, and procedures.  In terms of development approaches to security, Duke ORI evaluates and installs security patches in a timely 
fashion (generally weekly per DHTS guidelines), protects systems against self -propagating malware, 
maintains secure coding policies and practices, and utilizes standardized secure build processes to protect Duke hardware that accesses customer networks, protecting confidential data against attack.  Duke does not use of off -shore service providers and/or data center facilities.  For our study, the web 
application and supporting backend system that Duke ORI develops will be hosted internally on a Duke University server behind two secure firewalls.  Thus, study data will be stored only on approved, secure 
University servers.  In fact, all development will be conducted at all times on a Duke University server 
under the strict monitoring of Duke ITSO and DHTS.  
 
REDCap  
REDCap, via Duke University’s secured platform, will serve as a central database for clinically relevant 
extracted data from each participant’s electronic medical record, as well as serve as an electronic 
source of secure storage for documentation of study  visit completion, protocol deviations or 
unanticipated problems, adverse and serious adverse events, screening and enrollment logs, as well as the electronic informed consent. Only delegated study team members, such as the investigator(s), statisticians, and study team members will have access to the REDCap.  
 
 
Protocol Version: 5.1   Dated: 13 June  2022  Page 30 of 42 
 For data validation, a series of project -defined data checks and conditional constraints can be required 
to ensure the highest quality data collection.  All system login procedures and data submissions will be 
transported and encrypted via the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol to the secure central 
database at Duke University. The study team will have login/password (reset every 3 months) 
credentialing for authentication of all study staff.  A University -approved plugin will be used to 
operationalize user -level permissions based on user roles to limit study staff access to authorized 
records and data fields alone.  
 
The central REDCap database will run on a mirrored Duke University server system with automatic fail -over 
features, daily backups, and transaction logs.  This system is physically located in a Tier II Data Center 
providing backup power sources, climate control, fire protection, and 24x7 surveillance.  Audit logs will be reviewed routinely by Duke Health Technology Solutions staff to verify that security measures are 
operational.  The servers are scanned twice weekly for vulnerabilities and are currently mai ntained at the 
highest level of vendor and CERT security recommendations.  Data will never be shared outside the project unless authorized by the PIs (and approved by the NIH and IRB).  User authentication is based on user 
passwords as described earlier.  Password creation requirements are in place to guarantee “strong 
passwords” as defined by the CERT security recommendations.   
 15.  IRB  
Duke University Health System (DUHS) IRB will be utilized as the IRB of record for this project pilot randomized, RCT and the future RCT.

ICU attending has opted out of approval for all patient/family dads) .  
b) Survey 1, T1 is to be completed ideally on the day of consent, but within 72 hours.  
c) Family members are eligible for randomization to the study based on their NEST score at the completion of survey 1, T1 (> 10). Family members can be randomized to either the 
intervention or the control arm.  
d) The timing of completion of surveys T2, T3, and T4 are directly linked to the timing of completion of survey 1, T1. Family members will receive automated alerts notifying them of survey completion at each set time interval based on the completion of T1.  
e) The ICU Physician Family meeting occurs for any family member that is randomized to the intervention arm. The ICU physician in attendance will receive automated alerts 
notifying them of patient/family enrollment, the NEST score and associated results and daily reminders to complete the family meeting.  
f) Like the ICU Physician family meeting, the Palliative Care family meeting will occur for those individuals who are randomized  to the intervention arm; however, only family 
members who receive a NEST score > 25 or > their T1 NEST score at the completion of T2 will illicit the Palliative Care family meeting. The ICU Physician is responsible for facilitating in the coordination of the Palliative Care family meeting.  
g) Data entry is to be completed within the study EDC, REDCap.  
h) AE/SAE assessment and survival status will be completed via EMR review and/or telephone interview.

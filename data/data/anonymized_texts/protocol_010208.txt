 1.0 Introduction and Background  
1.1 Dietary sources of fatty acids  
 
Saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids (FA) can be synthesized by human cells and 
obtained from diet.  By contrast, polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) are essential FA that 
cannot be synthesized by mammals and must be obtained from diet. Thus the PUFA 
content of a tissue is dependent mainly on dietary intake. The shortest of the omega -6 
series of PUFA is linoleic acid (LA, 18:2, n -6) which is abundant in corn, sunflower, 
safflower , olive  and other  vegetable oils. Its 18 carbon omega -3 counterpart, α -linolenic 
acid (ALA, 18:3, n -3), is also a plant product found in leafy vegetables such as kale, 
spinach, broccoli and Brussels sprouts as well as walnuts and seeds such as flax and 
mustard. Both LA and ALA are converted through a series of enzymes to longer c hain 
PUFA: LA to arachidonic acid (AA, 20:4, n -6), and ALA to eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, 
20:5, n -3) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6, n -3). LA is the most abundant FA in 
Western diets with consumption in the US that is 10-fold that of ALA (reviewed in (1)).  
Cell culture and animal studies have shown that that a high intake of LA lowers the 
conversion of ALA to EPA (2) and that the major source of EPA and DHA in humans is 
the dietary intake of salt water fish (3). 
1.2 Dietary n -3 PUFA and breast cancer  
 
In human population studies, an inverse relationship has been observed between breast 
cancer incidence and calories from fish oil (4, 5). Nevertheless, current epidemiological 
literature on the association of marine PUFA and cancer remains controversial (6-8).  
One problem is t hat these studies have relied on data from self -reported dietary FA 
intakes or from estimates based on national consumption assessments that correlate 
poorly with direct measurements of FA in patient samples. The effect of n -3 PUFA 
depends on levels achiev ed in individuals and on the omega -3 PUFA content of the fish 
consumed. The EURAMIC study is one of the largest to use adipose tissue as a primary 
exposure measure for dietary fat intake (9). In this study, a lower ratio of n -6/n-3 PUFA 
was detected in adipose tissue of control compared to breast cancer subjects. A more 
recent study confirmed higher n -6 PUFA in adipose tissue of breast cancer pat ients 
compared to control individuals (10).  However outstanding gaps in existing knowledge 
of the potential benefit of n -3 PUFA in mo difying breast cancer risk remains the lack of 
actual measurement of the PUFA and PUFA metabolites in malignant and normal 
breast  tissues and an understanding of how dietary PUFA metabolism may contribute to 
and be altered in the neoplastic state.   
   
New data from the Women’s Intervention Nutrition Study (WINS) indicates that the risk 
of breast cancer recurrence can be reduced by a consuming a low fat diet (11). However, 
no attention was paid to specific FA species in the diet or how this might impact the FA 
content of breast tissue. Two earlier studies, one conducted with Japanese (12), the other 
CCCWFU 98113

Patients with Stage I -III Breast Carcinoma  
 
2 
 with Finnish patients (13), identified increases in total PUFA in cancer compared to 
benign breast tissue. No such data are available for patients consuming “Western” diets.  
Finally, studies extant assume a tight or even 1:1 relation between PUFA in plasma, red 
blood cells (RBC), and breast cancer. Although many studies including our own in non -
human primates (14) have demonstrated that plasma FA profiles reflect dietary intake, 
our preliminary studies contradict th e notion that RBC and to a lesser extent plasma 
measurements reflect the milieu in breast tissue.  
 
Mechanisms for modification of cancer risk by PUFA.  Studies in rodents strongly 
support a promoting role of omega -6 PUFA and a protective role of omega -3 PUFA in 
breast cancer (15-21): the growth of primary as well as metastatic tumors  is inhibited by 
omega -3 PUFA -rich diets and promoted by omega -6 PUFA -rich diets. Several studies 
have suggested a potential use for omega -3 PUFA as a nutritional adjuvant therapy. In 
athymic nude mice with human breast cancer xenografts, lung metastases w ere inhibited 
by dietary supplementation with omega -3 PUFA initiated before or after surgical removal 
of the primary tumors (22). Dietary omega -3 PUFA also increased the efficacy of 
chemotherapeutic agents, doxorubicin (23) and mitomycin C, (24) in inhibiting tumor 
growth. These studies strongly suggest potential benefits of omega -3 PUFA 
supplementation at all levels of breast cancer. Although several mechanisms have been 
suggested by animal and cell culture studies, the most often cited mode for omega -3 
PUFA action is their ability to block metabolism of omega -6 PUFA, AA and LA (25-28).  
When AA and LA are released from cell membrane phospholipids, they are oxygenated 
by cyclooxygenases (COX) -1/2, 5 -lipoxygenase (LOX), 12 -LOX, and 15 -LOX -1/2 to 
prostaglandin (PG)E 2, 5-hydroxy -eicosatetraenoate (HETE), 12 -HETE, 15 -HETE, and 
13- hydroxy -octadecadienoic acid (HODE) (27, 29-32). These metabolites can promote 
breast cancer growth and the pathways making them may be overactive in breast cancer 
(27, 29-34). In contrast, omega -3 PUFA inhibit the release and metabolism of AA and 
LA to reduce formation of the omega -6 PUFA metabolites (27, 29-32, 35). Thus, the 
development and malignant behavior of breast cancer may reflect the overproductio n of 
omega -6 PUFA -derived growth factors fueled by an omega -6 PUFA -rich diet and 
omega -3 PUFA -rich diets may inhibit this over -production. Our pilot data strongly 
support this concept.  
                     
Past studies on the effects of omega -6 PUFA metabo lites and drugs that inhibit the 
oxygenases that make them have implicated the metabolites and oxygenases as growth 
factors. However, they varied widely as to which oxygenases and metabolites are critical 
to the proliferation and survival of cultured human  breast cancer cells (29, 32, 35-37).  
Recent studies, including those in animals and humans, continue this disagreement.  
COX -2 and its PGE 2 product are elevated in mouse m odels of breast cancer; COX -2 
over-expression induces breast tumors and  Cox-2 knockout suppresses these tumors (33, 
34). Indeed, drugs that block COX -2 are associated with a reduced incidence of human 
breast cancer in human epidemiological studies (38) as well as  mouse models of breast 
cancer (39-41). COX -1 may contribute to these effects or, in the absence of COX -2, 
mediate them (34, 35). On the other hand, 5 -LOX inhibitors are particularly effective in

Patients with Stage I -III Breast Carcinoma  
 
3 
 stopping the growth of cultured human breast cancer cells, and 5 -LOX metabolites 5 -
HETE and 5 -oxo-ETE (made  from 5 -HETE by a dehydrogenase; both act on cells 
through a common receptor, OXE (42)), are mor e effective than PGE 2 in stimulating 
cultured human breast cancer cells to proliferate (43-47). Furthermore, mRNA for 5 -LOX 
and its activating protein (FLAP) are increased in human malignant as opposed to normal 
breast tissue and in node (+) compared to node ( -) disease; FLAP message levels 
correlate negatively with overall and disease -free survival (48, 49). Studies focusing on 
the 12 -LOX/12 -HETE axis find 12 -HETE is somewhat weaker than 5 -HETE in 
stimulating human breast cancer cell proliferation  (47) but forced expression of 12 -LOX 
stimulates  the proliferation of human breast cancer cells in vitro and in mice (50).  12-
LOX -p message is over -expressed in malignant compared to normal human breast tissue 
and cell lines (32, 48, 51) and, when coupled with FLAP mRNA levels, provides a better 
prognostic indicator of overall and disease -free survival in breast cancer than FLAP 
mRNA alone  (49).  Studies of 15 -LOX find that 15 -HETE a nd its hydroperoxy precursor, 
15-HpETE, may or may not inhibit the proliferation of breast cancer cells (46, 52) but 
mRNA and protein levels of their parent oxygenases, 15 -LOX-1 and 15 -LOX -2, are 
decreased in malignant compared to normal human breast tissue (48, 53).  Patients with 
low levels of message and protein for these oxygenases, or low 15 -LOX -1/15-LOX -2 
message or protein ratios, have higher recurrence rates and shortened survivals (53).  
Thus, a 15 -LOX, particularly 15 -LOX -1, may suppress tumor gr owth.  Nonetheless, 
human breast cancer cells metabolize LA to 13 -HODE through the action of 15 -LOX’s 
(and COX -1/2) (54). 13-HODE is implicated in the proliferation, invasiveness, and 
metastatic behavior of breast cancer cells (54, 55). 
 
It is fair to say that the animal and human breast cancer studies to date have : 1) assigned 
multiple a nd often contradictory roles to the oxygenases and omega -6 PUFA metabolites 
in human breast cancer ; 2) omitted companion studies on normal breast tissue ; 3) not 
addressed the role of diet in modifying the lipid milieu of breast tissue ; and most 
importantly , 4) focused on one or a limited range of oxygenases without measuring the 
metabolites per se. Because of the difficulty in measuring the metabolites, this last failure 
represents a critical barrier to progress in understanding the role(s) of PUFA in breas t 
cancer. Studies typically identified one or two omega -6 PUFA metabolites using high 
performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) or immunoassays in animals or cultured 
cells but generally have not examined humans. HPLC assays do not distinguish between 
close ly eluting metabolites (e.g. PGE 2 versus PGE 3) nor detect metabolites much below 
100 milligram levels. Immunoassays also do not distinguish omega -6 PUFA metabolites 
from their omega -3 PUFA counterparts and are not available for all the metabolites.  
Thus t hese methods are too insensitive and indiscriminant for human studies, particularly 
those analyzing the impact of omega -3 diets. In consequence, levels of the metabolites in 
malignant and normal breast tissue, the significance of their presence, and the im pact of 
omega -3 PUFA diets on this presence are unknown. We have developed a multiple 
response monitoring -liquid chromatography -tandem mass spectroscopy (MRM -LC/ 
MS/MS) method that measures pg  levels of PUFA metabolites in tissues to answer these 
vital questions.

 1.3 Rationale  
 
We hypothesize  that omega -3 PUFA dietary supplementation will lead to a decrease in 
the omega -6 PUFA metabolite milieu in malignant breast tissue and will  be associated 
with favorable prognostic markers. We will randomize women prior to definitive breast 
surgery to  two grams of omega -3 fatty acid supplements daily or a matching placebo.  
We will measure the levels of omega -6 PUFA, omega -3 PUFA , and certain of their 
metabo lites in the malignant breast tissue removed at surgery and compare the two 
groups. Further, we hypothesize  that a defined level of omega -3 PUFA dietary 
supplementation will: 1) “reset” the PUFA  metabolic pathway in malignant breast cells to 
one associated  with a better prognosis by lowering the tumor load of omega -6 PUFA 
metabolites , and 2) fuel the production of omega -3 PUFA metabolites with anti -growth 
activity. For comparative purposes, we will pair these measurements to those made in 
nearby normal brea st tissue.  
2.0 Objectives  
 
2.1 To determine if omega -3 dietary supplementation results in higher PUFA levels in

Patients will be presented with the study and, if interested, provide written informed consent  
during their standard -of-care office visit. In addition, the routine physical conducted as standard 
of care during this visit will be used to obtain patients’ medical history, concurrent medications, 
and vital signs for the research study.  
5.2 Omega -3 PUFA Supplementation  
 
Participants will be randomized to receive either two  grams of omega -3 PUFA or 
placebo daily until the day before surger y. Omega -3 PUFA is supplied as a one 
gram capsule (see section 8.0 for a full description of the product). Placebos will 
be identical to the omega -3 supplements in size and color and will contain 99% 
soybean oil and less than 1% each of natural vitamin E, natural lemon flavor, 
marine lipid, and rosemary extract . PUFA and placebo capsu les will be certified  
toxin -free product s, and PUFA capsules will have verified EPA and DHA levels.  
 
Patients on both arms of the study will be instructed to take two capsules daily 
from the day after enrollment and the last two capsules the day prior to surgery.   Baseline  Intervention

 The date that surgery is planned will be known at the time of randomization and 
an ample amount of the appropriate capsules will be supplied by the research 
nurse, plu s four days’ worth of extra capsules. If there is a delay in the planned 
surgery, the patient will be told to continue taking the capsules as directed until 
the day prior to the revised surgery date.  
 
After one week of taking the capsules, the research nu rse will call the patient to 
assess for adverse effects, self -reported compliance, confirm the surgery date, and 
address any other issues. In the event that the extra capsules are not sufficient to 
cover the remaining time until the scheduled date of surge ry, additional capsules 
can be mailed to the patient’s home if needed. If the patient remains on study 
beyond 7 days, then additional phone calls will occur at day 14 and day 21 (and 
every seven days thereafter) until the patient undergoes surgery. Appendi x C 
should be used to document the information obtained during these phone calls.   
 
5.3 General Concomitant Medication and Supportive Care 
Guidelines  
 
The u se of any NSAID or full-dose ASA -containing  NSAID while taking study 
drug prohibited. Should the use of these agents be deemed necessary, the 
participant in question will be discontinued from the study.  Participants will be 
asked to use acetaminophen if needed during the study.  
 
All other medications and/or therapies during th e intervention period will be 
performed as per standard of care, at the discretion of the participant’s physician.  
5.4 Duration of Subject Involvement  
 
Subject participation extends from enrollment (at the clinic visit for the initial 
diagnosis) until the perioperative collection of study tissue specimens (usually 7 -
14 days).  There will be no follow -up period, and the need for subject 
discontinuation is expected to be minimal. Nonetheless, participants will be 
withdrawn from the study in the event of any o f the following:  
 
 Intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of treatment,  
 Patient decides to withdraw from the study,  
 Patient develops the need to use of any NSAID or full -dose ASA -containing 
NSAID between biopsy and surgery, or 
 General or  specific changes in the patient's condition render the patient 
unacceptable for further treatment in the judgment of the investigator.

 6.0 Adverse Events List and Reporting Requirements  
6.1 Adverse Event List for Omega -3 Fatty Acids  
 
Supplementation wi th omega -3 PUFAs is generally well -tolerated and safe. 
Theoretical concerns have been voiced regarding omega -3 PUFA 
supplementation aggravating bleeding; however, a recent study confirmed 
findings of prior smaller studies and failed to demonstrate any incr eased 
hemorrhagic risk across a variety of indices. (56)   
 
Possible adverse events include nausea, burping with fishy aftertaste, or 
gastrointestinal problems. (57) 
6.2 Adverse Ev ent Characteristics  
 
 CTCAE term (AE description) and grade:  The descriptions and grading 
scales found in the revised NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse 
Events (CTCAE) version 4.0 will be utilized for AE reporting.  All 
appropriate treatment areas should have access to a copy of the CTCAE 
version 4.0.  A copy of the CTCAE version 4.0 can be downloaded from the 
CTEP web site ( http://ctep.canc er.gov ).

6.3 STRC SAE Reporting Requirements  
 
The Safety and  Toxicity Reporting Committee (STRC) is responsible for 
reviewing SAEs for CCCWFU Institutional studies as outlined in Appendix B. 
STRC currently requires that all unexpected 4 and all grade 5 SAEs on these trials 
be reported to them for review. All Clinic al Research Management (CRM) staff 
members assisting a Principal Investigator in investigating, documenting and 
reporting an SAE qualifying for STRC reporting are responsible for informing a 
clinical member of the STRC as well as the entire committee via t he email 
notification procedure of the occurrence of an SAE.

 6.4  WFUHS IRB AE Reporting Requirements  
 
Any unanticipated problems involving risks to subjects or others and adverse 
events shall be promptly reported to the  IRB, according to institutional policy .  
Reporting to the IRB is required regardless of the funding source, study sponsor, 
or whether the event involves an investigational or marketed drug, biologic or 
device.  Reportable events are not limited to physica l injury, but include 
psychological, economic and social harm.  Reportable events may arise as a result 
of drugs, biological agents, devices, procedures or other interventions, or as a 
result of questionnaires, surveys, observations or other interactions w ith research 
subjects.  
 
All members of the research team are responsible for the appropriate reporting to 
the IRB and other applicable parties of unanticipated problems involving risk to 
subjects or others.  The Principal Investigator, however, is ultimate ly responsible 
for ensuring the prompt reporting of unanticipated problems involving risk to 
subjects or others to the IRB.  The Principal Investigator is also responsible for 
ensuring that all reported unanticipated risks to subjects and others which they  
receive are reviewed to determine whether the report represents a change in the 
risks and/or benefits to study participants, and whether any changes in the 
informed consent, protocol or other study -related documents are required.  
 
Any unanticipated proble ms involving risks to subjects or others occurring at a 
site where the study has been approved by the WFUHS IRB (internal events) 
must be reported to the WFUHS IRB within 7 calendar days of the investigator or 
other members of the study team becoming aware  of the event.  
 
Any unanticipated problems involving risks to subjects or others occurring at 
another site conducting the same study that has been approved by the WFUHS 
IRB (external events) must be reported to the WFUHS IRB within 7 calendar 
days of the i nvestigator or other members of the study team becoming aware of 
the event.  
 
Any event, incident, experience, or outcome that alters the risk versus potential 
benefit of the research and as a result warrants a substantive change in the 
research protocol or  informed consent process/document in order to insure the 
safety, rights or welfare of research subjects.  
7.0 Pharmaceutical Information

 7.1 Pharmaceuti cal Information for PUFA Supplement  
 
Product description :  The omega -3 supplements used in this study will be  
provided by Nordic Naturals . The specific omega -3 formulation to be used in this 
study is  ProOmega®, a marine oil concentration containing omega -3 PUFA, 
eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and doxosahexaenoic acid (DHA), supplied in 
triglyceride form. Each 2 capsule dose contains 650 EPA / 450 DHA per 2 soft 
gels. 
 
Route of administration:   Patients will take two capsules by mouth per day.  
7.2 Pharmaceutical Information for Placebo  
 
Placebos used in this study will also be supplied by Nordic Naturals . Each capsule 
will be identical in size and shape to the PUFA supplements;  however they will 
contain 99% soybean oil and less than 1% each of natural vitamin E, natural 
lemon flavor, marine lipid, and rosemary extract.   Patients randomized to receive 
placebo will take two capsules by mouth per day.  
8.0 Correlative/Special Studies  
 
Between 5 and 10 0mg of  tumor tissue and a similarly -sized section of adjacent normal 
tissue (obtained from site s equidistan t from the site of prior fine needle aspiration) will be 
retrieved at surgery and immediately  divided  into sections for separate analys es of the 
meta bolites and PUFA. For metabolites, a section is placed in 1 ml of tris -buffered saline 
(4 ºC, pH 7.4) containing 100 μM diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid to chelate metals 
that attack alkenes, 80 μM of butylated hydroxytoluene to prevent oxidation, and 5 ng of 
each deuterated metabolite to serve as internal standards.  For PUFA, a section  will be 
suspended in ethanol (4 ºC) containing 80 μM butylated hydroxytoluene and 100 μM 
triphenyl -phosphine. Samples on ice will be transported to our lab. Metabolite sa mples 
will be extracted with hexane:  ethyl acetate (1:1) . Extracts will be blown dry under a 
stream of N 2, taken up in methanol, and stored under Argon at -80 ºC. PUFA samples 
will be stored at -80º under Argon in their original ethanol -inhibitor solution and 
extracted immediately before GC analysis .  
 
All tissues will be coded  with a unique identifier  so that patient identities cannot be 
discerned . 
 
Whole blood (4 ml) will be drawn into EDTA -containing tubes from patients both at 
baseline and immediately b efore surgery; placed on ice; adjusted to  100 μM in 
diethylenetriamine -pentaacetic acid and 80 μM butylated hydroxytoluene; transported on 
ice to our lab  (Hanes 4032, contact Tiffany Walker -West at 336 -716-3443 who will 
transport samples from OR to the lab ); and centrifuged (1000g, 5 min, 4 º).  RBC will be 
washed with tris -buffered saline (pH 7.4) and suspended in buffer containing 80 μM

 butylated hydroxytoluene and 100 μM triphenylphosphine. RBC and plasma (1 ml) are 
stored at -80 ºC under Argon and extra cted immediately before GC. In general, samples 
are placed in storage within 90 min of procurement.   
 
Our Institution performs Mib1 on all patients undergoing breast cancer surgery. Tissue 
blocks will be obtained from the Department of Pathology archives for the preparation of 
slides for cleaved caspase -3 immunostaining in our laboratory.  
 
For MRM -LC/MS/MS, breast tissues will be spiked with deuterated standards (5 ng) of 
each metabolite at the time of extraction except d 4-PGE 2 and d 8-5-HETE will be used as 
the internal standard for PGE 3 and 5 -HEPE, respectively . We have synthesized d 5-17-
OH-DHA for use as the internal standard for 17 -OH-DHA. Extracts will be assayed for 
the daughter ion of each deuterated and non -
deuterated species, all of which have uniq ue 
LC elution times, M-1 masses, and/or M-1 
breakdown ion masses ( Table 1) relative to 
other monitored and unmonitored metabolites.   
 
Data are converted to pg/mg wet tissue weight 
and then corrected for  processing losses by 
comparison to the recovery of their respective 
deuterated analogs.  We validated the 
accuracy and precision of this method and 
determined the linearity of recoveries over 1 
pg-100 ng of each metabolite in cultured 
mouse prostate cancer cells.  Our MS system 
is a Waters Quatro II with a Z -spray interface 
and automated by a Spark Holland LC and a 
Reliance Autosampler and Conditioned 
Staker maintained at 4 ºC.  We use a c one voltage of 35V and a capillary voltage of 2.4  
kV for HETE, HODE, and DHA metabolites and 50V and 3.5 kV for PG metabolites.  
The LC system  for the latter three types of metabolites is a Waters Corp YMC ODS -AQ 
1.00 mm I.D.x100 mm length  column eluted at  0.05 ml/min with 2  mM NH 4OAc, pH 
8.0, as solvent A and MeOH as solvent B in the following gradients: 0 min, 70% B; 0 -4 
min to 90% B; 4 -5 min, 90% B; 5 -6 min to 70% B; 6 -30 min, 70% B.  The HETEs elute 
with complete baseline separation in this system.  The  LC system  for PGs is a 
Phenomenex Luna Phenyl -Hexyl 1.00 mm I.D. x 150 mm length column eluted at 0.07 
ml/min with H 2O as solvent A and  CH 3CN, 0.1% formic acid,  as solvent  B in the 
following stepwise gradients: 0 min, injection; 0 -6 min,  20% B; 6 -6.1 min to 45% B; 6.1 -
7.1 min, 45% B; 7.1 -7.2 min to 65% B; 7.2 -9.2 min, 65% B; 9.2 -9.3 min  to 20% B; 9.3 -

some patients we may have the opportunity to collect a specimen at study enrollment for 
research purposes only. In that small subse t we will have an additional core biopsy 
available for research purposes. We will evaluate the FAs pre -surgery and pre -
intervention. We anticipate that approximately 10 -20 patients will be appropriate for a 
core biopsy for research purposes only.

9.0 Statistical Considerations  
9.1  Study Design/Endpoints  
 
This is a randomized, placebo controlled  phase II trial assessing the effect of omega -3 
dietary supplementation on PUFA levels ( LA, AA, EPA, DHA, total omega -6 PUFA, 
total omega -3 PUFA and n -6/n-3 PUFA ratios ), metabolites of omega -3 and omega -6 
PUFA  (see Table 1), and proliferation and apoptosis  in women with stage I -III breast 
cancer. Patients who meet the eligibility criteria will be randomized to omega -3 dietary 
supplementation or a matching placebo with equal probability. Randomization will occur 
follo wing the diagnosis of breast cancer and at least one week prior to the scheduled 
surgical resection. Patients will take two capsules per day from the time of randomization 
through the day before surgery.  The primary objective is to assess the effect of om ega-3 
supplementation on PUFA levels in normal and metastatic breast tissue and in plasma 
and red blood cells. Secondary objectives include assessing the effect of the omega -3 
supplementation on the metabolites of omega -3 and omega -6 PUFA in malignant and 
normal breast tissue and assessing the effect of the supplementation on proliferation and 
apoptosis in malignant breast tissue.

 9.2  Analyses  
Descriptive reports will consist of summary statistics (means, standard deviations, 
proportions, etc.) for pati ent characteristics and outcome measures (including toxicities) 
by treatment arm. Tables, graphs, and charts will be used to illustrate the data when 
appropriate. Accrual and toxicity are followed by the Safety and Toxicity Review 
Committee, and adverse ev ents will be reported to the IRB.  
Analysis of variance (ANOVA) will be used to assess the effect of omega -3 dietary 
supplementation on PUFA levels separately in normal and malignant breast tissue .  
Additionally, we will fit the normal and malignant breast  tissue jointly as repeated 
measures to see if there are PUFA differences by tissue type and to determine if the 
omega -3 effect differs in the two tissue types (tissue type by treatment interaction). Since 
we will have pretreatment PUFA levels in the serum , we will use analysis of covariance 
(ANCOVA) to assess the omega -3 effect in plasma and RBC, where the baseline levels 
of the PUFAs will be included as covariates.  In all analyses, residuals will be assessed to 
determine if the assumptions of variance ho mogeneity and normality (and linearity for 
the ANCOVA models) are met, and transformations will be used if needed. The 
secondary outcomes will be analyzed using the same methods as described for the 
primary outcomes.  
9.3  Sample Size/Power  
Sixty patients will be accrued to this stu dy, approximately 30 in each ar m. This sample 
size will allow us to detect a one standard deviation (SD) difference between treatment 
groups in PUFA levels with 80% power at the 5% overall level of significance (allowing 
for multiple comparisons by using a Bonferroni correction – each tes t done at the 0. 05/7 
level of significance), assuming a 10% drop -out rate. The anticipated accrual rate for this 
study is two patients per month.  
9.4  Stratification/Randomization  
There are no strata in this study. All eligible patients will be randomized to omega -3 
supplementation or a matching placebo with equal probability using a variably sized 
permuted block randomization scheme. Block sizes will be chosen randomly to ensure 
that future randomizations cannot be inferred from past assignments.

 Appendix  B – Mandatory STRC  SAE Notificatio n Procedure  
 
Mandatory S afety and Toxicity Review Committee (STRC) Serious Adverse Event (SAE) 
Reporting Requirements – Revised 6/05/2012  
 
This document describes STRC reporting and use of the electronic submission form that is 
submitted for unexpected grade 4 and any grade 5 (death during protocol intervention) 
SAEs on CCCWFU Institutional interventional trial patients . There are multiple entities that 
require reporting of SAEs. Each entity has different rules for what is reported, and ho w it is 
reported.  
 
Rules used by other entities (Institutional Review Board (IRB), AdEERS, MedWatch, etc.) 
should NOT be used to evaluate whether an event should be reported to STRC. Only the rules for 
reporting described in this document should be consid ered.  
 
As defined in the NCI summary IV reporting guidelines, CCCWFU Institutional studies 
covered by these reporting requirements are defined as: In-house, internally reviewed 
trials, including those collaborative studies conducted with industry sponsorsh ip in which 
the center is a primary contributor to the design, implementation, and monitoring of the 
trial, or participation in a multi -site trial initiated by an institutional investigator at 
another center.   Institutional trials are almost  always authore d by a researcher here at 
CCCWFU. Institutional protocols are labeled NCI Code=”I” for Institutional on the protocol 
screen in ORIS. Cooperative group protocols are not considered Institutional, but Research Base 
trials are classified as Institutional.  
 
The STRC  is responsible for reviewing SAEs for CCCWFU Institutional studies, as defined 
above. STRC currently requires that unexpected grade 4 and all grade 5 SAEs on these trials be 
reported to them for review. All Clinical Research Management (CRM) staff m embers assisting 
a PI in documenting and reporting an SAE that qualifies for STRC reporting are responsible for 
informing a clinical member of the STRC by phone, followed by informing the entire committee 
via the required email notification.  
 
THESE REPORTI NG REQUIREMENTS APPLY TO EVERYONE WORKING WITH 
CANCER CENTER INSTITUTIONAL PROTOCOLS.  
 
What is considered an SAE under this mandatory procedure?  
Any unexpected grade 4  event not including routinely experienced events per protocol (e.g. 
myelosuppression) an d all grade 5 events  (death during protocol intervention) should be 
reported. The patient is considered “on -treatment” as defined in the protocol, which can extend 
days/weeks/months past the last date of actual protocol intervention.

STRC reporting may not be appropriate for specific expected adverse events for protocols. In those 
situations the adverse events that will not require STRC reporting must be specified in the text of 
the approved protocol.  
 
STRC notification responsibilitie s of the person handling the reporting/documenting of the 
SAE:  
1. Make a phone call to the appropriate clinical member of the STRC as listed below (page if 
necessary) —see note 2 below  
2. Submit the STRC Notification Form WITHIN 24 HOURS of first knowledge of the  event. 
This form is found at either the ORIS main menu page or by going to 
http://ccc.wfubmc.edu/oris/strc.aspx . 
This will ensure that all persons that the event  applies to will be notified; remember to  file a 
copy of your confirmation. (Form instructions will walk you through the required fields, 
consult the help page for further instructions.)  
3. Ensure that you document that the appropriate persons on the STRC has been contacted.  
4. Follow up with/update th e clinical member of STRC regarding any new developments or 
information obtained during the course of the SAE investigation and reporting process.  
 
Elements needed to complete the electronic STRC form:  
1. ORIS Patient ID (PID)  
2. Name of STRC Clinician notified/ Date/Time/Comments.  
3. Grade of event.  
4. Is this related to protocol intervention or treatment?  
5. Is suspension of the protocol needed?  
6. Is any change to consent or protocol needed?

24 
 7. Was the nature or severity of the event unexpected?  
8. Date of the event.  
9. Brief description of the event using approved CTC version terminology.  
10.  Date of last study dose before event.  
11. Relevant tests/labs.  
12. Most importantly make sure that the Investigator assigns attribution to the reported 
 event (grade) using the appropriate CTCAE ver sion for the protocol.  
 
The Clinical Members of STRC to Notify by Phone or Page:  
 
Bayard Powell, MD  – Director -at-Large, CCCWFU; Chair, PRC; Section Head,  
Glenn Lesser, MD – Hematology Oncology  
Kathryn Greven, MD  – Vice Chair –  
Marissa Howard -McNatt, MD  – General Surgery  
 
Definition of Unavailable:  As a general guideline if the first clinician that is contacted does not 
respond to the phone call or page within a reasonable amount of time, then initiate contact with 
their backup.  Give the back -up a reas onable amount of time to respond to a phone call or page 
before contacting another member. This is a general guideline.  You must use your best 
judgment as a clinical research professional given the time of day, severity of the SAE, and other 
circumstances  as to when it is appropriate to contact backup clinicians.  If the event occurs near 
the end of day, then leave messages (voice or email) as appropriate and proceed with submitting 
your STRC notification form.  The important criteria is that have taken re asonable steps to notify 
and document that you have initiated some type of contact to one or more of the clinical 
members of STRC.  
 
STRC CLINICAN RESPONSIBILITY:  
 
It is the responsibility of the STRC clinician to review all reported events, evaluate the ev ents as 
they are reported; and communicate a response to the Investigator, event reporter and the 
members of STRC. The review will include but not be limited to the information reported; there 
may be times when additional information is needed in order for  an assessment to be made 
further communication directly with the investigator may be warranted. STRC reserves the right 
to agree with the investigator’s assessment if STRC does not agree with the investigator STRC 
reserves the right to suspend the trial p ending further investigation.  
 
AMENDMENTS TO PREVIOUS REPORTS  
 
If you are not able to supply all pertinent information with the initial submission, once the 
additional information is available do not submit a new report . Go to the original email that 
was r eceived by STRC and others “reply to all” and entitle your email “ Amendment for (list 
date of event and patient ID) this will avoid duplications of the same event. List the additional 
information which you are reporting.

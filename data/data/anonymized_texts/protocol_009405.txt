PROPERTY OF MERUS N.V.   CONFIDENTIAL  Page 5 of 127 SUMMARY OF PROPOSED CHANGES AND RATIONALE  
 
Section / Page  Throughout the document Version Number and Version Date.  
Rationale  Administrative change s to clearly document new version.  
 
Section / Page  Section in Protocol Synopsis: Study duration  
Rationale  The initial anticipated “Completion of the data analysis ” date of October 2019 has been 
exceeded  due to a handful of patients who still benefit from the study drug. P rotocol Version 
5.0 provides a new expected date . 
  
Section / Page  Section 3.2: Study duration  
Rationale  Update to reduce the study procedures.  
Since the  Development International Birth Date  of 13 January 2015,  until the cutoff date 12 
January 2022,  a total of 363 cancer patients had been treated with MCLA -128 in 2 Clinical 
Trials.  So far, the safety profile  including identified  (IRRs)  and potential risks  (Diarrhea and 
decreased cardiac ejection fraction)  associated with MCLA -128 is cons idered acceptable  with 
the implementation of appropriate risk management measures including directed  exclusion 
criteria, premedication, symptomatic treatment, and targeted monitoring.   
With this consideration, the Sponsor proposes for the  remaining  patients who have been on 
treatment for at least 24 months in this study , to reduce the study procedures in order to  
decrease the ir burden , but to offer the opportunity to continually  derive  benefit from the  
Study drug . The Sponsor will continue to   monitor   Safety and efficacy , either via an 
alternative “post -study  or Expanded access ” program or via the implementation of Protocol 
Version 5.0. This will allow an expedited analysis of study results, while  maintaining an 
appropriate level of safety surveillance.  
 
Section / Page  Summary of study procedures  
Rationale  The replacement of c olumn s Study treatment period, End of Treatment  
Visit and Follow -Up period, to reduce t he study procedure s for the patients remaining on the 
study.   
Patients transferring into the alternative program will follow a similar treatment plan.  
 
Section / Page  Section 8.2: Laboratory Assessments  
Rationale  Updated for clarity  
 
Section / Page  Section 8.8.2 : LVEF (by ECHO or MUGA) and 12 -lead electrocardiogram (ECG)  + Appendix 3  
Rationale  Updated from every 4 cycles (3 months) to every 6 months due to the current Safety Profile  
and the focus on the appropriate level of safety surveillance.  
 
Section / Page  Section 9.1: Tumor Assessments  
Rationale  Updated from every 6 weeks to every 12 weeks to reduce the patient’s burden, but still 
allows the possibility to have a Tumor Assessment done in between in case of symptomatic  
deterioration signs  or signs of disease progression.  
 
Section / Page  Efficacy assessments central review: Protocol synopsis  and section  9.1.1 . 
Rationale  Enough independent central analysis of patient imaging has been completed and additional 
assessment of imaging for those patients currently on treatment for at least 24 months is no 
longer required.  Therefore, central review of imaging by an independent radiologist(s) for 
all patients on -study is no longer applicable as of Protocol Version 5.0.  
The Sponsor relies on the local Investigator assessment  and continued focus  will be on the 
appropriate level of safety surveillance.

PROPERTY OF MERUS N.V.   CONFIDENTIAL  Page 6 of 127  
Section / Page  Protocol synopsis  Biomarkers ; section 11 
Rationale  Enough biomarker data has been accumulated from all patients treated on the trial. 
Therefore the additional data from the few patients who have been on treatment for 24 
months is not needed as per Protocol Version 5.0.

STUDY DESIGN  
A phase 2 , open -label, multicenter international study will be performed to evaluate the efficacy of MCLA -
128-based combinations in two metastatic breast cancer (MBC) populations, HER2 -positive/amplified 
(Cohort 1) and ER -positive/low HER2 expression (Cohort 2).  Three combination treatment s will be 
evaluated , two in Cohort 1 an d one in Cohort 2 , in 20-30 sites in 7  countries in Europe and the USA . 
Protocol  MCLA -128-CL02  Version 5.0, 11 April 2022  
 
 
 
PROPERTY OF MERUS N.V.   CONFIDENTIAL  Page 8 of 127 Cohort 1:  Patients with HER2 -positive/amplified MBC, having confirmed HER2 overexpression by 
immunohistochemistry (IHC) 3+ or IHC 2+ combined  with positive fluorescence in situ  hybridization (FISH), 
who have been treated  with  up to a maximum of 5 lines of HER2 -directed therapy in the metastatic setting 
and have progressed on the most recent line as per RECIST v1.1 , are eligible. Patients must have been 
treated previously  with  trastuzumab , pertuzumab and an HER2 ADC  in any sequence and in any setting . For 
enrollment, HER2 status will be based on medical records, and eligibility will be confirmed subsequently as 
soon as possible, by central lab review. Patients found to be ineligib le retrospectively will not be evaluable 
for the primary objective and may be replaced. Documented imaging proof of disease progression on the 
last prior line of therapy should be made available  when possible . 
Initially MCLA -128 will be administered with t rastuzumab (doublet combination). Safety will be reviewed by 
an Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC). After the safety of the doublet has been assessed, 
MCLA -128 + trastuzumab + vinorelbine (triplet combination) will be evaluated in parallel with t he doublet 
combination (see figure below).  
The doublet and triplet Cohort 1 combinations will both be evaluated in two steps with an initial safety run -
in in 4 to 6 patients  who will be  review ed by the IDMC , followed by a cohort efficacy expansion, as 
described below. The triplet combination go/no -go decision will be made by the IDMC  after evaluation of 
the doublet safety run -in patients . If the triplet combination is considered safe, t he expansion of the 
doublet and triplet  combinations will be performed  in parallel . Patients with be included with a 3:1 ratio for 
triplet or doublet respectively , favoring the triplet combination  and taking into account previous exposur e 
to vinorelbine . 
Study design for Cohort 1 combination therapies (doublet and triplet)  
 
Safety run -in: After 4 -6 patients have received at least 2 complete cycles (6 weeks) of MCLA -128 + 
trastuzumab, a safety review will be performed  by the IDMC . If the doublet combination is considered safe, 
the safety run -in for the triplet combination will be initiated  in the next 4 to 6 successive eligible patients . 
Safety of the triplet will be evaluated  by the IDMC  after these 4-6 patients have received at least 2 complete 
cycles (6 weeks) of MCLA -128 + tra stuzumab + vinorelbine.  
Based on the observed safety in the first 4 -6 patients (adverse events [AEs], serious adverse events [SAEs], 
relationship to study drug, and other clinically relevant parameters [e.g. laboratory parameters], available 
PK, immunogeni city, and cytokine data) the  IDMC,  investigators and Sponsor will decide on a potential 
additional run -in period for each combination (i.e. doublet and triplet).  
Expansion:  After the safety run -in, each Cohort 1 combination therapy considered tolerable by the IDMC 
will be expanded to a total of up to 40 patients evaluable  for efficacy.  
If the doublet combination regimen is not tolerated, Cohort 1 will be closed. If the triplet combination is not 
well tolerated but the doublet is acceptable, the doublet expansion will be continued.  
Cohort 2:  Patients with ER -positive and low HER2 expression MBC (IHC 1+, or IHC 2+ combined with 
negative FISH) who have radiologic or  photographic evidence of  disease progression  on the last line of prior 
endocrine therapy (a dministered for at least 12 weeks) that included an aromatase inhibitor or fulvestrant. 
Patients who have received up to 3 prior endocrine therapies in the metastatic setting and have progressed 
on a cyclin -dependent kinase inhibitor (in any line) are elig ible. For enrollment, HER2 and HR status and  
radiologic /photographic  documentation of prior progression will be based on medical records. Eligibility will 
be confirmed as soon as possible for HER2/HR status by central lab review and for prior disease progr ession 
by central imaging review. Patients found to be ineligible retrospectively will not be evaluable for the 
primary objective and may be replaced.

PROPERTY OF MERUS N.V.   CONFIDENTIAL  Page 9 of 127 MCLA -128 will be administered in combination with the same previous endocrine therapy on which 
progressiv e disease is radiologically /photographically  documented. A total of up to 4 0 patients evaluable for 
efficacy will be included.  
 
Study design for Cohort 2 combination therapies  
 
An Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) , composed of at least 2  physicians  expert  in the 
domain of early clinical development in MBC , will review safety and efficacy throughout the study and 
decide on the addition of extra patients in the expansion parts, opening of the triple combination cohorts, 
and any ad hoc  safet y decisions. The principal investigators, the Sponsor’s medical expert(s) and other 
representatives may be called upon to assist as observers .

doublet and triplet  combinations will be performed  in parallel . Patients with be included with a 3:1 ratio for 
triplet or doublet respectively, favoring the triplet combinat ion and taking into account previous exposur e 
to vinorelbine ; for Cohort 2, no specific treatment assignment is required.  
Treatment adaptation  
• No dose reductions are permitted for MCLA -128, trastuzumab, or endocrine therapy agents.  
• The vinorelbine dose will be decreased or interrupted in cases  of decreased neutrophil counts or 
elevated bilirubin levels, according to the SPC, and discontinued if grade ≥ 2 neurotoxicity (NCI -CTCAE v . 
4.03) occurs .  
• MCLA -128 infusion will be interrupted  in the event of an infusion -related reaction  (IRR) and must be 
stopped definitively for severe IRRs. For mild to moderate events the infusion can be resumed at a 50% 
infusion rate and infusion duration extended to 4 hours.  
• MCLA -128 and trastuzumab adminis tration can be delayed for a maximum of 6 weeks between 
infusions to manage AEs, specifically for clinically significant LVEF decreases , signs of congestive heart 
failure  or persistent grade 2 o r grade 3 -4 diarrhea . 
• Hormone therapy drugs will be administer ed according to the SPC of each drug.  
Treatment duration  
Study treatment  will be administered until confirmed progressive disease (as per RECIST 1.1), unacceptable 
toxicity, withdrawal of consent, p atient non -compliance, investigator decision (e.g. clinica l deterioration),  
treatment  interruption > 6 consecutive weeks , withdrawal of any study drug . Patients will be followed up 
for safety for at least 3 5 ± 5 days following the last  study drug  administration and until 
recovery /stabilization of related toxicities, and for disease progression and survival status for 12 months.  
PROPHYLACTIC AND CONCOMITANT MEDICATION  
Permitted  
• Administration of paracetamol/ acetaminophen,  antihistamines and corticosteroids is mandatory with 
every MCLA -128 administration. In the event of an IRR  or hypersensitivity, the patient will be managed 
according to local clinical practice, as clinically indicated.  
• All medication necessary for the wel lbeing of the patient and which is not expected to interfere with 
evaluation of the study drug , including s upportive treatment of symptoms and AEs or standard 
treatment of concomitant conditions  may be given at the investigator’s discretion.  
• Goserelin in p re/peri -menopausal women who started an LHRH agonist >4 weeks prior to study entry . 
Prohibited

radiologist(s) will be performed for all patients  (screening and on -study) .  
 
Enough independent central analysis of patient imaging has been completed and additional assessment of 
imaging for those patients  currently on treatment for at least 24 months is no longer required.  Therefore, 
central review of  imaging by an independent radiologist(s) for all patients on -study  is no longer applicable 
as of Protocol Version 5.0. 
 
Bone scans will be performed as clinically indicated  for patients with bone metastases at baseline  or 
suspected lesions on study.  
Tumor markers ( CA15 -3, CEA, CA27 -29) will be assessed on Day 1 every cycle.  
BIOMARKERS  
Candidate exploratory biomarkers will be evaluated in tumor tissue (screening, optional after 12 weeks  and 
End of Treatment  [EOT] ) and blood (pre-dose on Day 1 every 4 cycles and EOT). 
Enough biomarker data has been a ccumulated from all patients  treated  on the tri al. Therefore the 
additional data from the few patients who have been on treatment for 24 months is not needed  as per

STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
Sample size  
Cohort 1 safety run -in: 4 to 6 evaluable patients in the safety run -in will have power to detect an AE with a 
true incidence of 33% is 80 to 90%.  
Cohort 1 efficacy expansion:  40 evaluable patients in the doublet or triplet combination will have adequate 
precision to exclude 30% (lower limit of 90% CI > 30%). The threshold for the CBR rate at 24 weeks is 
defined based on the assumption that PFS follows an exponential distribution  with a median of 5 months 
(clinically relevant) and 3.5 months (not clinically relevant) .  
Cohort 2:  40 evaluable patients with observed CBR of at least 45% will provide enough precision to exclude 
30% (lower limit of 90% CI>30%). The threshold for CBR at  24 weeks is defined based on the assumption 
that PFS follows an exponential distribution with a median of 5 months (clinically relevant) and 3.5 months 
(not clinically relevant).  
The final number of patients will depend on the safety and eff icacy outcomes  during the study. U p to ~130 
patients are anticipated, allowing for  a total of 40 patients in each of the three planned combination 
regimens and a  ~10% rate of non -evaluable patients.  
Definitions  
All efficacy endpoints will be defined and analyzed based o n tumor assessment by RECIST 1.1.  
CBR: the proportion of patients with a best overall response of CR, PR or SD ≥ 24 weeks.  
ORR: the proportion of patients with best overall response of CR or PR.   
PFS: the time from treatment start until radiologic progress ion or death due to any cause.  
PFS ratio: the ratio  of PFS with the previous regimen to PFS on study treatment.  
DoR: the time from response (CR or PR) until progression or death due to underlying cancer.  
OS: the time from treatment start until death due to  any cause.  
Endpoints  
Primary  
Cohort s 1 and 2 : CBR per investigator radiologic review at 24 weeks  
Key secondary  
Cohort 1:  CBR at 24 weeks per central review, and ORR, PFS, and DoR per investigator and central review  
Cohort 2: CBR at 24 weeks per central  review, and PFS  per investigator and central review  
Other secondary (both cohorts):  
Safety:  Incidence, severity and relationship of AEs, laboratory abnormalities, SAEs, ECG and LV EF 
measurements and vital signs

PROPERTY OF MERUS N.V.   CONFIDENTIAL  Page 16 of 127 Tolerability: discontinuations due to AEs, dose modifications due to AEs, immunogen icity, and cytokine 
assessments  
Other efficacy:  DoR (Cohort 2), PFS ratio (Cohort 2), ORR (Cohort 2),  and OS (Cohorts 1 and 2)  
Pharmacokinetics: Cmax, C0h, AUC, CL, V ss, tmax and t 1/2 for MCLA -128, and  CEOI and C 0h for trastuzumab.  
Analysis populations  
Treated population: patients who receive at least one dose of MCLA -128.  
Evaluable for efficacy: patients who receive at least 2 complete cycles (6 weeks) of treatment and have 
undergone baseline assessment and one on-study tumor assessment, or who discontinue early due to 
disease progression.  
Analyses  
Patient disposition and demographics will be analyzed in the treated population, efficacy will be analyzed in 
the evaluable for efficacy population, and safety will be  analyzed in the treated population.  
Quantitative variables will be summarized using descriptive statistics. Continuous variables will be 
presented as N, mean and/or median, standard deviation, range. Categorical variables will be presented 
using frequenci es and percentage.  
Criteria for success primary endpoint for Cohorts 1 and 2:  A median PFS of  5 months  is assumed as relevant, 
with the activity threshold for CBR at 24 weeks set to 45%.  
CBR and ORR will be summarized with accompanying 90% exac t binomial C I.  
For PFS, OS and DoR the survival function will be estimated using the Kaplan -Meier product limit method; 
probability estimates and 90% CI will be provided at specified time points; median duration and 90% CI will 
also be provided. DoR will be estimated  for responders only.  The number and proportion of any patients 
with a PFS ratio ≥ 1.3 will be tabulated for Cohort 2 with 90% exact C I. 
AEs will be tabulated by the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA®) preferred term and by 
organ class a ccording to incidence and severity. Severity of AEs will be based on CTCAE 4.03.  
PK, immunogenicity, cytokines and biomarkers will be analyzed centrally and reported  separately .

1.1 Metastatic Breast Cancer  and Current Therap eutic Options  
Breast cancer is a global disease, with a yearly incidence of over 1.67 million patients worldwide  
reported in 2012, accounting  for over 25% of all cancers in women and ranking  as the fifth  cause of 
cancer death in women (522,000 deaths) (IARC/WHO) . In the United States, over 25 0,000 women are 
expected t o develop the disease  in 2017, with  over 40, 010 deaths  (Siegel et al., 2017) .  
Approximately 5 -10% of breast cancer patien ts are diagnosed with metastasis at initial presentation, 
and overall 20% will eventually develop metastasis (Chang et al., 2003) . The development of 
metastases dramatically worsens the prognosis. About 9 0% of breast cancer mortality is due to 
metastases that are resistant to adjuvant therapies (Gonzalez -Angulo et al., 2007) . Metastatic breast 
cancers  (MBC)  represent a heterogeneous population with a diverse clinical course. Median survival 
ranges from 15 to 27 months in stage IV breast cancer despite more aggressive disease management 
and recent more effective therapeutic age nts (Andre et al., 2004; Giordano et al., 2004; Dawood et 
al., 2008) , and overall survival (OS) rates v ary significantly. This highly unpredictable clinical behavior 
reflects the biologic heterogeneity of the disease, which is cl assified based on the presence or the 
absence  of hormone receptors for estrogen and/or progesterone, and the expression/amplificat ion 
status of the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) protein/oncogene  (Hammond et al., 
2010; Wolff et al., 2013) .  
The primary goa ls of systemic treatment for MBC are prolongation of survival, alleviation of 
symptoms, and maintenance or improvement in quality of life, despite the toxicity associated with 
treatment (Osoba, 1995; Geels et al., 2000; Stockler et al., 2000) . Systemic treatments for MBC incl ude 
chemotherapy, endocrine therapy (ET), biological targeted therapy, and supportive therapy. For 
patients with advanced MBC, the choice of therapy is based on considerations related to patient 
characteristics and comorbidities, disease status, prior trea tments, and biological characteristics of 
the tumor (NCCN, 2017.; Bernard -Marty et al., 2004) .  
1.1.1 HER2 -Positive Breast Cancer  
Approximately 15% to 20% of breas t cancer tumors overexpress HER 2 (Slamon et al., 1987; Witton et 
al., 2003) , a member of the HER superfamily  composed of tyrosine kinase receptors regulati ng 
proliferation and survival of epithelial cells. The family includes four receptors: HER1 (ep idermal 
growth factor receptor [ EGFR ]), HER2 [neu, C -erbB2] , HER3 and HER4. HER2 is considered an orphan 
receptor as it has no known ligand , while  the three other HER receptors have known ligand s and form 
either homodimers or heterodimers upon ligand binding. HER2 can heterodimerize with any of the 
other receptors and is considered the preferred dimerization partner. Dimerization results in 
autophosphorylation of tyrosine residues within the rece ptor cytoplasmic domain and initiates signal 
transduction via the PI3K/AKT and RAS/MAPK pathways (Browne et al., 2009; Castaneda et al., 2010) .  
HER2  overexpression/amplification in breast cancers is associated with a more aggressive clinical 
phenotype and historically portends poor prognosis (Slamon et al., 1987) . Although HER2 -
overexpression identifies p atients who are likely to respond to therapy with trastuzumab, not all these 
patients retain benefit from treatment. Approximately 15% of patients relapse after therapy, 
indicating the presence of de novo  or acquired resistance (Nahta and Esteva, 2006) . Several resistance 
mechanisms have been proposed including (1) altered receptor -antibody  interaction, (2) activati on of 
downstream pathways via increased signaling from other HER family members or other receptors, or 
(3) constitutive activation of downstream elements.

PROPERTY OF MERUS N.V.   CONFIDENTIAL  Page 33 of 127 1.1.1.1  Anti -HER2 A ntibodies  in HER2 -Positive MBC  
The humanized anti -HER2 antibody  trastuzumab (Herceptin ®) impro ves response  rate, PFS and OS 
when added to chemotherapy for advanced HER2 -positive breast cancers (Slamon et al., 2001) . In 
early stage HER2 -positive breast cancer, several pivotal trials have sh own improvement s in disease -
free survival  and OS, and trastuzumab/chemotherapy combination  has now become standard therapy 
for most such cases (O’Sullivan et al., 2015) . Nonetheless  approximately 30 –50% of patients with naïve 
HER2 -positive  MBC do not achieve an objective response in the first -line setting indicating de novo  
resistance to trastuzumab, with both time to progression  (TTP)  and OS being short (7 –17 months and 
22–38 months, respectively) (Slamon et al., 2001; Baselga et al., 2012b; Nielsen et al., 2013; Swain et 
al., 2013) . This has motivated the development of alternat ive approaches to block HER2 signaling.  
Multiple lines of research have highlighted a central role for HER3 signaling as a key mechanism for de 
novo  and acquired resistance to HER2 therapies in several tumor types leading to the development of 
compounds ai med at disrupting signaling through HER2:HER3 heterodimerization, the mechanism by 
which HER3 elicits signaling (Jiang et al., 2012) . 
Pertuzumab is a fully humanized monoclonal antibody that binds to a different epitope of the HER2 
extracellular domain (subdomain II) than trastuzumab (subdomai n IV), presumably preventing HER2 
from dimerizing with other HER family members (EGFR, HER3 and HER4), notably HER3. In 2012, 
results from the phase 3  CLEOPATRA study (Clinical Evaluation of Pertuzumab and Trastuzumab) led 
to FDA approval for pertuzumab in  combination with trastuzumab and docetaxel for the treatment of 
patients with HER2 -positive  MBC who have not received prior anti -HER2 or chemotherapy for 
metastatic disease. The primary endpoint of centrally confirmed PFS was significantly longer with the  
addition of pertuzumab, improved  by 6.3 months from a median of 12.4 to 18.5 months ( hazard ratio 
[HR] of 0.62 for progression or death, 95% CI 0.51 –0.75 , p <0.001) (Baselga et al., 2012b) . OS was also 
markedly prolonged with the addition of pertuzumab, with 1 5.7-month increase from 40.8 to 56.5 
months (HR 0.68, 95% CI 0.56 –0.84 , p <0.001) (Swain et al., 2015) , confirming that this  triple drug 
combination  is a promising approach . 
1.1.1.2  T-DM1 in HER2 -Positive MBC  
Ado-trastuzumab emtansine (T -DM1) is a novel antibody drug conjugate composed of trastuzumab 
linked to emtansine (DM1; a derivative of maytansine), a highly potent anti -microtubule cytotoxic 
agent. T -DM1 was granted FDA approval in 2013 for HER2 -positive  MBC progressing  after trastuzumab 
and taxane therapy in the metastatic setting , or following early relap se on adjuvant trastuzumab -
based therapy. Approval was based on the EMILIA trial, a randomized, ope n-label, international phase 
3 trial comparing T -DM1 with lapatinib plus capecitabine in patients with HER2 -positive  MBC 
previously treated with trastuzumab and a taxane (Verma et al., 2012) . Median PFS was significantly 
prolonged with T -DM1 compared with lapatinib plus capecitabine (9.6 versus 6.4 months; HR for 
progression or death from any cause 0.65, 95% CI 0.55 –0.75 , p <0.001). Median OS was also 
significantly improved with T -DM1 (30.9 versus 25.1 months; HR for death from any cause 0.68, 95% 
CI 0.55 –0.85, p  <0.001) and ORR was higher with T -DM1 (43.6% versus 30.8%, p  <0.001). Based on 
this, T-DM1 is now the standard of care as s econd -line therapy for HER2 -positive  MBC. A second 
randomized, o pen-label, international phase 3  trial (TH3RESA) provided supportive data (Krop et al., 
2017) . For patients progressing  on trastuzumab -based therapy and T -DM1, treatment options inc lude 
trastuzumab with another chemotherapy agent, or with combined capecitabine and lapatinib.

PROPERTY OF MERUS N.V.   CONFIDENTIAL  Page 34 of 127 1.1.2 Hormone Receptor Positive Breast Cancer   
Approximately 75% of breast cancers are considered estrogen and/or progesterone  receptor positive 
(Nadji et al., 2005; Rugo, 2008) . Such tumors are associated with better survival than those with low 
or no estrogen receptor expression (Yu et al., 2012) . The hormone estrogen (17ß -estradiol E2) 
represents the primary stimulant in the growth and development of these tumors (Johnston and 
Dowsett, 2003) . Thus, deprivation of estrogen signaling via ET has become the mainstay of treatment 
for early and metastatic estroge n receptor positive  (ER+)  disease in the absence of visceral crisis.  
1.1.2.1  Endocrine Therapy  
A variety of ET options are available, including oophorectomy, gonadotropin -releasing hormone 
analogs, selective estrogen receptor modulators  (SERMs ; tamoxi fen), select ive estrogen receptor 
degraders  (SERDs ; fulvestrant ) and aromatase inhibitors (AIs; letrozole, anastrozole and exemestane) 
(Buzdar and Hortobagyi, 1998; Lumachi et al., 2015) . AIs block estrogen production by inhibiting 
aromatases in both peripheral tissues and the cancer, and are only effective for postmenopausal 
women in whom the ma jor source of estrogen comes from the conversion of androgens to estrogens 
via aromatase enzyme activity in peripheral tissues such as adipose tissue and the breast.  Tamoxifen 
was the first selective estrogen receptor modulator used clinically and is still  widely prescribed in pre -
menopausal women.  
The use of hormone therapies target ing and downregulating  estrogen receptor signaling is a mainstay 
of treatment for patients with ER+ breast cancers , and has substantially reduced the relapse rate for 
early -stage breast cancer (Early Breast Cancer Trialists’ Coll aborative Group (EBCTCG), 2005) . However 
about one -third of all hormone receptor -positive/HER2 -negative patients diagnosed with early stage 
disease, experience disease recurrence (Baselga et al., 2012b) , and in this setting single -agent AIs or 
tamoxifen show  limited clinical benefit (Klijn et al., 2000; Baselga  et al., 2012a) . Resistance manifests 
as either relapse after treatment of primary hormone receptor -positive breast cancer or as disease 
progression in the metastatic setting (Larionov and Miller, 2009; Dalmau et al., 2014) .  
ET resistance is complex and heterogeneous and may differ from pati ent to patient, between primary 
and acquired resistance and even between ET types. A wide range of distinct mechanisms implica ted 
in ET resistance in breast cancer have been described including 1) ER mutations in the ligand -binding 
domain (Li et al., 2013; Merenbakh -Lamin e t al., 2013; Segal and Dowsett, 2014) , epigenetic changes 
(Parl, 2003; Fan et al., 2006)  or reduced expression (Martínez -Galán et al., 2014) , 2) crosstalk between 
the ER and EGFR/HER2 involving the PI3K -Akt-mTOR and MAPK pathways, with  HER2 overexpression 
confer ring ET resistance , even in t he presence of hormone receptors  (Lupien et al., 2010)  with

1.1.2.2  CDK4/6  Therapy

PROPERTY OF MERUS N.V.   CONFIDENTIAL  Page 35 of 127 models suggest a particular role for CDK4/6 inhibition in ER+ breast cancer cells, including estrogen -
sensitive and estrogen -resistant models. Cyclin D1 amplification is a common event in ER+ breast 
cancer, identifi ed in 58% of hormone re ceptor -positive /HER2 -negative breast cancer  (Cancer Genome 
Atlas Network, 2012) . Antiestrogen -induced growth arrest in ER+ breast cancer  cells is accompanied 
by decreased cyclin D1 expression, whereas the emergence of ET resistance is associated with 
persistent cyclin D1 exp ression and retinoblastoma (Rb) phosphorylation (Watts et al., 1995; 
Thangavel et al., 2011) . Evidence of a continued role for CDK4/6 inhibition in ET-resistant ER+ cells 
comes from in vitro  evaluation of the CDK4/6 inhibitor palbociclib in a panel  of molecularly 
characterized breast cancer  cell lines that demonstrated the most activity in ER+ cancers including 
those with conditioned estrogen resistance (Finn et al., 2009) .  
Anti-CDK4/6 agents inhibit the phosphorylation of the Rb tumor suppressor, which promotes Rb -E2F 
binding and prevents E2F -mediated oncogenic transcription. Compelling pr eclinical data indicate  the 
efficacy of palbocic lib in ER+ breast cancer cell lines (Fry et al., 2004; Toogood et al., 2005; Dean et al., 
2010) . The phase 3  PALOMA -2 trial confirmed 10-month improved PFS in women  with ER+ MBC 
treated with first -line letrozole plus palbociclib versus letrozole alone (24.8 vs 14.5 months, HR, 0.58; 
P <.000001)  (Finn et al., 2016) , i.e., in  women who  had not received ET for m etastatic disease. The 
phase 3  PALOMA -3 trial demonstrated  5-month improved PFS in women with ER+ MBC who had 
progressed despite ET for metastatic disease, treated with palbociclib plus fulvestrant, versus 
fulvestrant alone (9.5 v s 4.6 months; HR, 0.46; P <.0001)  (Cristofanilli et al., 2016) . Thus palbociclib 
plus letrozole is the preferred first -line therapy in women with ER+ MBC, and pal bociclib plus 
fulvestrant i s effective therapy in patients with ER+ MBC not previously treated with palbociclib who 
have p rogressed on a nonsteroidal AI.  
The success of palbociclib spurred the development of other CDK4/6 inhibitors including ribociclib  
(Hortobagyi et al., 2016) , which is now FDA approved in combination with fulvestrant, and 
abemaciclib, which has been granted an FDA breakthrough therapy designation , while FDA approval 
will be requested for abemaciclib in combination with fulvestrant , based  on the MONARCH -2 study 
(Sledge et al., 2017) . 
1.1.2.3  mTOR I nhibition  
The PI3K -Akt-mTOR pathway is a key intracellular signaling pathway playing a significant role in cell 
growth and proliferation, and is implicated in resistance to ET , HER2 -directed therapy, and cytotoxic 
chemother apy. Furthermore, mTOR inhibitors such as everolimus synergized with letrozole in 
preclinical models (Mayer, 20 13) and mTOR was described as a mechanism facilitating escape of long -
term estrogen deprivation (deGraffenried et al., 2004b) . The addition of mTOR inhibitors to ET h as 
been investigated in phase 2 and 3  trials, including patients with ER+/HER2 -negative MBC.  
The phase 3  trial BOLERO -2 enrolled 724 patients with ER+ advanced breast cancer  with  recurrence 
during or within 12 months after adjuvant non -steroidal AI s or progression during or within 1 month 
after AI treatment (Baselga et al., 2012a) . Patie nts were randomized to receive everolimus combined 
with exemestane versus exemestane plus placebo. The pre-planned interim analysis  showed that  
median PFS was significantly better for everolimus plus exemestane compared to the control arm, for 
both investi gator analyses (6.9 months versus 2.8 months; HR = 0.43, 95% CI 0.35 -0.54, p  <0.001 ) and 
central analyses ( 10.6 versus 4.1 months, HR  = 0.36, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.47, p <0.001). A fter a median 18-
month follow -up, the addition of everolimus to exemestane was co nfirmed to significantly improve 
patient outcome over exemestane alone (median PFS 7.8 versus 3.2 months, HR  = 0.45, 95% CI 0.38

1.2 Development of MCLA -128 
1.2.1 Description of  MCLA -128  
MCLA -128 is a bispecific humanized full length IgG1 antibody with enhanced antibody -dependent cell -
mediated cytotoxicity ( ADCC ) activity  targeting the receptor tyrosine kinases HER2 and HER3 . It is 
produced by recombinant expression in the Chinese hamster ovary cell line, CHO -DG44.   
Molecular formula : C6479H9997N1725O2024S45 
Molecular mass : 145.9 kDa  
Chemical name : Not yet issued  
INN:  Not yet issued  
MCLA -128 is composed of two identical common light chains and two different heavy chains each 
containing a different fragment antigen -binding. The Fc regions of both heavy chains have been 
engineered in a complementary manner  using CH3 engineering, to ensure efficient 
heterodimerization and bispecific antibody  formation  and to enhance ADCC activity following a 
reduction of fucosylation . MCLA -128 has a 1331 amino acid sequence containing four disulfide bonds 
and a  molecular weight of 145.9 kDa.  
MCLA -128 acts via two independent mechanisms of action: 1) inhibition of HER3 pathway signaling by 
disruption of HER2:HER3 heterodimerization  and 2) elimination o f tumor cells via enhanced ADCC, 
and employs a ‘dock and block’ mechanism. Based on X -ray crystal struc ture, MCLA -128 docks to the 
HER2 domain I which orientates the HER3 binding arm to block the HER3 domain III (putative HRG 
domain), thus blocking oncogenic signaling via the HER2:HER3 heterodimer  (Maussang -Detaille et al.) . 
MCLA -128 does not compete with trastuzumab for binding to HER2 since it is binding to a different 
domain.  
MCLA -128 is formulated as a clear liquid solution for infusion at a target concentration of 20 mg/mL 
in 25 mM histidine, 220 mM trehalose and 0.16 mM polysorbate 20  at pH 6.0 in clear type I glass vials 
with an extractable volume of 5 mL  or 18.8 mL . 
1.2.2 Preclinical Studies   
1.2.2.1  Pharmacology  
In vitro  pharmacodynamic studies showed the mean K D values for MCLA -128 of 3.2 and 2.0 nM in BT -
474 and SK -BR-3 cells  (HER2 -amplified breast cancer cell lines also expressing HER3), respectively, and 
which  were in the same range as for trastuzumab (3.7 and 1.3 nM respectively). Although K D values of 
the individual HER2 and HER3 Fabs of MCLA -128 showed a higher affinity f or the HER3 Fab compared 
to HER2 Fab, the overall affinity of MCLA -128 was closest to the HER2 Fab and correlates with the 
overexpression of HER2 in the cell lines . MCLA -128 potently inhibited  heregulin (H RG)-induced  
proliferation and morphologic changes of HER2 -overexpressing breast cancer cell lines SK -BR-3 and 
BT-474. MCLA -128 has been shown to inhibit HRG -mediated proliferation in breast and gastric cell 
lines, at a notably lower half-maximal inhibitory concentration  (IC 50=35 pM) than combined

PROPERTY OF MERUS N.V.   CONFIDENTIAL  Page 37 of 127 trastuzum ab and pertuzumab , and f ully inhibited HRG (3.75 nM) -induced HER2:HER3 dimerization 
with a higher potency than the anti -HER2 pertuzumab plus trastuzumab antibody combination. HRG 
binds to HER3, resulting in its dimerization with HER2 and subsequent inducti on of intracellular 
signaling (Peess et al., 2015) . MCLA -128 selectively inhibits the formation of HRG -induced HER2:HER3 
dimers . 
In vivo , MCLA -128 was evaluated in a xenograft murine model with the breast cancer cell line JIMT -1 
leading to tumor volume reduction after 29 days with 60% survival (with four weekly doses of 25 or 
2.5 mg/kg MCLA -128), while no animals treated with trastuzumab and pertuzumab experienced a 
decrease in tumor  volume  and none survived. Both HER2: HER3 heterodimerization and HER3:PI3K 
formation was significantly inhibited in MCLA -128-treated tumor tissue.  
Breast cancer brain metastases are known to use an HRG -dependent survival mechanism (Momeny 
et al., 2015) . In an orthotopic ST1360B murine brain metastatic breast cancer model, all mice treated 
with MCLA -128 (25 mg/kg twice weekly) survived for 21 days, co mpared to all vehicle animals which 
were  sacrificed.  
1.2.2.2  Pharmacokinetics  
The cynomolgus monkey was selected as the non -clinical toxicology species due to cross reactivity of 
the two Fab fragments in MCLA -128 towards both human and monkey HER2 and HER3, and la ck of 
cross -reactivity of the HER2 binding arm to rodent HER2.  
Following a single intravenous dose of MCLA -128 in cynomolgus monkeys, systemic exposure was 
dose proportional across the range 10 -100 mg/kg, with terminal elimination half -lives in the range 7 3-
210 hours. Half -life tended to increase with increasing dosage, suggesting a possible contribution from 
target -mediated clearance at lower dosages, with endogenous IgG clearance mechanisms being more 
predominant at higher dosages. The calculated volumes of distribution were in the range 68.3 -121 
mL/kg, slightly higher  than the plasma volume in monkeys, suggesting limited distribution outside the 
plasma compartment.  
Exposure following the first dose in the repeated dose toxicity study (five doses of MCLA -128, once  
weekly  for 5 weeks ) was dose -proportional and there was no sex difference in PK parameters. Most 
animals were continuously exposed to MCLA -128 during the treatment period, with a 3-fold 
accumulation (based on AUC) observed in females at 10 m g/kg/week, no accumulation at 30 
mg/kg/week, an d only slight accumulation (1.4 -1.7 fold) in low -dose males (10 mg/kg/week) and 
animals at 100 mg/kg/week . Few animals showed evidence of loss of exposure towards the end of the 
treatment period, which correla ted with the presence of ADA.  
1.2.2.3  Toxicology  
MCLA -128 was well tolerated following single and repeated dose (up to five weekly doses) intravenous 
administration in cynomolgus monkeys, with no treatment -related clinical, laboratory or pathological 
findings up to the highest dose tested (100 mg/kg).  
There was no evidence of cardiotoxicity or effects on thyroid function. The 1 -month repeated dose 
toxicity study in cynomolgus monkeys, at IV dos es up to 100 mg/kg, showed that MCLA -128 had no 
effect on the central or peripheral nervous systems, ECG intervals, blood pressure, or respiration rate. 
There was some evidence of an immune response to MCLA -128 in a few treated animals in the 
repeated dose toxicity study, but all treated animals were exposed to MCLA -128 for all  of or the 
Protocol  MCLA -128-CL02  Version 5.0, 11 April 2022  
 
 
 
PROPERTY OF MERUS N.V.   CONFIDENTIAL  Page 38 of 127 majority of the treatment period, such that the formation of ADA in isolated animals was not 
considered to have compromised the safety evaluation. There were no treatment -related changes to 
hematologic, chemistry or urinalysis paramet ers. Overall, all changes observed were procedural in 
origin, or related to an immune response to MCLA -128 in individual monkeys in the treatment groups. 
There was no evidence of target organ toxicity in the clinical pathology investigations or terminal 
pathology data.  
MCLA -128 formulations showed good local tolerability, with no evidence of local irritation at injection 
sites in the cynomolgus monkey toxicity studies, and no hemolytic potential or plasma incompatibility 
in an in vitro  hemocompatibility study conducted in human blood. A tissue cross -reactivity study 
conducted with human tissues showed no evidence of any non -specific or ‘off -target’ binding that was 
likely to be of clinical concern, most non -epithelial binding being cyto plasmic in nature, and thus 
unlikely to be relevant to the in vivo  administration.  
There was no evidence of cytokine release after infusion of MCLA -128 in cynomolgus monkeys at 
doses up to 100 mg/kg. Since monkeys are known to be poor predictors of cytokin e release in humans, 
in vitro  cytokine release studies were performed. In vitro  cytokine release studies conducted using 
whole human blood from healthy donors showed a very low potential for MCLA -128 to induce 
cytokine release, compared to reference antibo dies such as Campath ®. In this test system, both MCLA -
128 and trastuzumab showed little or no cytokine release  However, since trastuzumab is known to 
induce a certain incidence of infusion reactions in clinical use, and there are likely to be low levels of  
HER2/HER3 expression in healthy donor blood (as used in the in vitro  cytokine release assays), further 
cytokine release testing was performed as part of the ADCC effector function assays conducted with 
HER2 and HER3 expressing cell lines. In these studies , cytokines were determined in supernatants 
collected following co -incubation of human effector cells (PBMCs) with the HER2 and HER3 expressing 
SK-BR-3 cell line, with or without addition of MCLA -128 (and also trastuzumab as a comparator 
antibody). Based o n the EC 20 and EC 50 values for the four cytokines that were significantly released 
upon incubation with the therapeutic antibodies (i.e. IFNγ, IL -6, IL -8 and TNFα), it can be concluded 
that MCLA -128 was 2.2  to 7.1 times more potent in inducing cytokine rel ease than trastuzumab.  
Genotoxicity and carcinogenicity studies are not considered appropriate for this class of biological 
product.  
1.2.3 MCLA -128 Clinical Experience  
At the time of protocol writing, MCLA -128 was under  evaluat ion in an ongoing  first-in-human  phase  
1/2 study  in adult pati ents with advanced solid tumors  (MCLA -128-CL01) . A summary of this  open -
label dose -escalation study of single agent MCLA -128 followed by cohort expansion at the 
recommended phase  2 dose (RP2D)  is summarized here. See  the Invest igator Brochure  for further 
details . 
The primary objective of the dose escalation part of the study was to determine the maximum 
tolerated dose (MTD) in patients with advanced or metastatic epithelial tumors relapsed or refractory 
to at least 2 prior regim ens of standard treatment or without any standard treatment available. 
Secondary objectives included safety/tolerability, PK, immunogenicity and efficacy.  
The phase 1 part of the study  is complete with  9 dose levels investigated  with MCLA -128 administered  
at 40, 80, and 160 mg in cohorts of 1 patient, then 240, 360, 480, 600, 750, and 900 mg (flat dose) 
once every 3 weeks (q3w) administered over 60 -120 minutes intravenously (IV) in cohorts of 3 to 6 
Protocol  MCLA -128-CL02  Version 5.0, 11 April 2022  
 
 
 
PROPERTY OF MERUS N.V.   CONFIDENTIAL  Page 39 of 127 patients. No dose limiting toxicities  were experienced up  to and inclu ding 900 mg in the phase 1  part. 
The Data Review Committee selected  750 mg q3w as the RP2D  as a 120 -minute IV infusion  based on 
the cumulative safety profile, available P K data and a PK simulation study.   
At the initiation of the current MCLA -128-CL02 study, safety, tolerability and efficacy were under 
evaluation at the RP2D in the phase  2 part in selected solid tumor expansion cohorts with advanced 
or metastatic relapsed or refractory epithelial HER2 -expre ssing tumors ; to date, cohorts have been 
opened for  metastatic  breast, gastric/gastroesophageal, ovarian, colorectal  (cohort closed  
prematurely ), non-small cell lung cancer  and endometrial cancer s. 
1.2.3.1  Patient s and Treatment  
As of 15 February 2017, a total of 47 patients were enrolled in the study, 28 in the phase  1 part and 
19 in the phase  2 part.  
In the phase  1 part, median age was 60 years (range 25 -83), 61% of patients were male, and ECOG PS 
was 0/1 in 43%/57% of patients. The main tumor types were colorectal  (8 patients), 
gastric/gastroesophageal (6 patients), and breast (3 patients). Patients had a median of 2 metastatic 
sites (0 -14) and had received a median of 3 lines of prior metastatic therapy (range 1 -7). 
Among  the 19 patients enrolled in the phase  2 part  (3 not yet treated at the data cut -off), ten had 
breast cancer, 6 gastric/gastroesophageal, 2 ovarian, and 1 colorectal cancer. M edian age was 54 years 
(range 33 -74), 32% of patients were male, and ECOG PS was 0/1 in 17%/83% of patients. Patie nts had 
a median of 2.5  metastatic  sites (range 1 -4) and had received a median of 5.5 prior lines of metastatic 
therapy (2 -18). All 10 enrolled breast cancer patients had received 3 -4 prior lines of anti -HER2 
therapies.  
A median of 2 cycles (range 1 -28) we re administered to the phase  1 patients and as of 15 Feb 2017, 
of the 19 enrolled phase  2 patients, 16 had been treated, receiving a median of 3 cycles (range 1 -12), 
while the 9 treated MBC patients receiving a median of 5 cycles (range 2 -12). 
1.2.3.2  Safety   
In the phase  1 part,  the most frequent related  adverse events  (AEs) were infusion -related reactions 
(IRRs ; 10 patients, 36%), and gastrointestinal toxicity, notably nausea (8 patients, 29%), vomiting (7 
patients, 25%), diarrhea (5 patients, 18%), and stomatitis (4 patients, 14%). Asthenia/fatigue were 
reported in 4/2 patients (14%/7%) and skin disorders (rash/dermatitis/fissures/nail disorder) in 6 
patients (21%).  All related AEs were grade 1 -2 other than one grade 3 event (suspected related IRR).  
In the phase  2 part, the most frequent AE s were IRRs (4 patients, 25%), diarrhea (3 patients, 19%), and 
fatigue (2 patients, 13%). All but one were grade 1 -2, with 1 patient experiencing  a grade 4 suspected 
related hypersensitivity reaction (allergy)  which had  a fatal outcome . This 71-year -old gastric 
carcinoma patient experienced a grade 4 hypersensitivity reaction (life -threatening). At baseline she 
had 56% LVEF and severe aortic valve and mitral valve stenosis with no clinical manifestations. On the 
first da y of treatment she was premedicated with dexamethasone (5 mg), polaramine (5 mg) and 
paracetamol (1 g). After administration of 60 mL of MCLA -128 (out of 250 mL total) she presented 
with a grade 4 allergic reaction, and subsequent cardiorespiratory arrest,  and died 9 hours after 
treatment initiation. The investigator reported that the allergic reaction was definitely related to the 
study drug. The patient had no history of hypersensitivity, allergic or anaphylactic reactions. As per

PROPERTY OF MERUS N.V.   CONFIDENTIAL  Page 40 of 127 the investigator, the al lergic reaction was the driver of the causality of the death however the patient’s 
comorbidities, notably severe aortic stenosis likely played a major contributing role.  
Key aspects of the MCLA -128 safety profile are : 
• IRRs, which w ere analyzed according t o all preferred terms considered  by the investigator  as 
manifestations of IRRs occurring within 24 hours of the MCLA -128 infusion (including notably  IRR, 
hypersensitivity, nausea, vomiting, pyrexia, etc .) were reported in  14 phase  1 patients (50 %) and 
5 phase  2 patients (31%) . All but 2 IRRs were grade 1 -2 and resolved complete ly with symptomatic 
treatment.  
• No suspected cardiac clinical AEs or clinically significant LVEF declines occurred; overall 5/27 
(19%) evaluable patients had grade 2 LVEF decreases, none symptomatic or clinically significant 
(defined as LVEF decline >  10% from baseline and to a value of <  50%).  
• No severe (grade 3 -4) diarrhea or diarrhea requiring treatment discontinuation was observed.  
1.2.3.3  Pharmacokinetic s, Cytokines and Immunogenicity  
In the 28 phase  1 patients C max and area under the concentration versus time curve (AUC) increased 
with increasing dose. Terminal half -life (t ½) increased with increasing dose up to 360 mg, as is typically 
observed for antibodies that are cleared by target -mediated clearance, after which it did not increase 
significantly , giving  an approximately dose -proportional increase of MCLA -128 exposure from 480 mg. 
Among the 16 patients treated at the RP2D of 750 mg q3w (6 phase  1, 10 phase  2), mean C max was 194 
µg/mL, and AUC 0-∞ was 22500 µg·h/mL, V ss was 4.5 L  (indicating that distribution is confined to the 
blood and interstitial fluids, typical of antibodies) , CL was 37 mL/h, and t ½ was 101 h. After 21 days, 
median trough levels were 2.6 µg/mL, well a bove the MCLA -128 concentration that results in 50% 
receptor occupancy in vitro (K D) (Alsina et al., 2017) . 
An interim population PK analysis on PK samples of 26 phase  1 patients cove ring all dose levels, 
showed PK data were best described by a two -compartment model with parallel linear and 
concentration -dependent (nonlinear) clearance from the central compartment. The nonlinear 
clearance reflects elimination processes of MCLA -128 afte r its saturating binding to the targets. The 
linear clearance represents the elimination of unbound MCLA -128. Estimated parameters were in 
accordance with parameters calculated by the non -compartmental analysis and with PK 
characteristics of therapeutic an tibodies in general. The K m value that determines the serum 
concentration at which a half maximal elimination rate is achieved was estimated at 0.290 µg/mL 
which is in the same range as the KD obtained for MCLA -128 on HER2 -amplified BC cell lines . 
Only 1 p atient (160 mg MCLA -128) of 34 evaluable  (from both phase  1 and 2 patients) had a positive 
anti-drug -antibody (ADA) titer at Day 36, with no apparent effect on PK. All other patients were ADA -
negative throughout treatment.  
At the RP2D, modest and transient  cytokine elevations from baseline were observed 2 hours after the 
end of the infusion, mainly in IFNγ (0.4 -3.4 fold), IL -8 (0.7 -8.4 fold) and TNFα (0.8 -11.6 fold)  (Alsina et 
al., 2017) . 
1.2.3.4  Clinical Activity  Including MBC  Patients  
Among the 28 evaluable  phase  1 patients, 1 non-small cell lung cancer patient had a confirmed PR 
(360 mg, 18.0 months) an d 3 patients had SD >3 months (breast, 3.6 months; colorectal, 7.3 months;

PROPERTY OF MERUS N.V.   CONFIDENTIAL  Page 41 of 127 gastroesophageal junction, 13.4+ months).  
Sixteen phase  2 patients were evaluable , 9 MBC and 7 with other tumors. Antitumor activity was seen 
in 6 MBC patients (1 PR and 5 SD), and 2 other tumor types (2 SD including a gastric patient with 7+ 
cycles).  
Evaluation of efficacy in the  overall MBC cohort  at potentially active MCLA -128 doses  (9 phase  2 
treated at 750 mg, 2 phase  2 treated at 480 mg  [1 phase  1 patient treated at 40 mg was not included 
for efficacy evaluat ion]), 1 patient had PR and 7 had SD (4 lasting ≥ 5 months) , giving a clinical benefit 
rate (CBR) in MBC patients of 64% (7/11 patients) . All these pa tients were heavily pretreated, all with 
2-5 anti -HER therapy lines  (Alsina et al., 2017) . 
1.3 Rationale for the Current Study  
Breast cancer management has a significant need in the MBC setting for new agents with novel 
mechanisms o f action and non -overlapping toxicity, which can be combined with established breast 
cancer treatments to overcome resistance for different patient populations.  
1.3.1 Preclinical Studies  for MCLA -128 + Trastuzumab in HER2 -Positive MBC  
There is a strong rational e to combine trastuzumab with MCLA -128 for the treatment of MBC. 
Trastuzumab is effective in blocking constitutive ligand -independent signaling through the HER2:HER3 
heterodimer in the context of HER2 overexpression. However, it has very poor growth inhibi tion 
activity in tumors and cell lines where HER2:HER3 signaling is driven by HER3 ligand dependency 
(Wehrman et al., 2006; Junttila et al., 2009) . Preclinical and clinical evidence points to increased HER3 
expression and/or HER3 ligand upregulation as the main drivers leading to trastuzumab resistance 
(Sergi na et al., 2007; Ocana et al., 2013) . The bispecific antibody MCLA -128 docks HER2 present on the 
cancer cells to subsequently lock HER3 in an inactive confirmation. This results in potent inhibition of 
the HRG ligand -induced HER2:HER3 dimer formation an d may overcome the resistance mechanism 
observed with trastuzumab.  
Preclinical studies showed that the combination of MCLA -128 and trastuzumab was more potent than 
single -agent MCLA -128 to block HRG -induced tumor proliferation, supporting the addition of MCLA -
128 to a trastuzumab -containing regimen in the clinic. In addition, the bispecific anti -HER2xHER3 
antibody MCLA -128 presents enhanced ADCC. The monovalent interaction of the antibody to HER2 
results in a greater density of antibody per tumor cell. In turn, this will result in greater recruitment of 
immune effector cells and, combined with ADCC, superior tumor cell killing activity.  
In light of the distinct mechanisms of action for MCLA -128 and trastuzumab, these preclinical data 
suggest that administra tion of MCLA -128 and trastuzumab in HER2 -positive patients has the potential 
for additive or synergistic activity in this setting.  
1.3.2 Preclinical Studies  for MCLA -128 + Endocrine Therapy in Hormone Receptor -
Positive/HER2 -Negative MBC  
Bidirectional crosstalk between ER and HER2/3 has been hypothesized to underlie ET resistance via 
their activation (Houston et al.,  1999; Thrane et al., 2013) . The HER2:HER3 heterodimer activates 
PI3K/AKT and MAPK downstream signaling cascades but can also induce ER phosphorylation 
independent of estrogen (Pietras et al., 1995; Curley et al., 2015)  which may reduce the effec tiveness 
of endocrine therapies (Arpino et al., 2008) . On the other hand, HER2 may be preferentially 
upregulated by estrogen deprivation, while tamoxif en induces expression of EGFR and HER2 (García -

PROPERTY OF MERUS N.V.   CONFIDENTIAL  Page 42 of 127 Becerra et al., 2012) . The nature of  the HER2/ERα cross -talk seems to be conditioned by the context 
of endocrine resistance; in a series of paired biopsies from patients relapsing on tamoxifen evaluated 
in an in vivo  model, conversion from HER2 -negative to HER2 -positive was rare, however  <20% of 
tamoxifen -resistant patients relapsed with adaptive upregulation in HER2 and either suppressed or 
enhanced ERα expression and signaling (Gutierrez et al., 2005) .  
Taken together, these data support a combined ER/HER2 -targeted approach in patients with acquired 
ET resistance in ERα -positive/HER2 -negative breast cancer. The EGF30008 trial comparing letrozole 
alone v ersus in combination with lapatinib in hormone receptor -positive MBC suggests this may be 
translated into the clinic, as although the addition of lapatinib did not confer benefit in the overall 
hormone receptor -positive/HER2 -negative group, there was a tre nd toward a benefit in the 
endocrine -resistant hormone receptor -positive/HER2 -negative subset (Johnston et al., 2009) . 
A recent precli nical study took this concept a step further, demonstrating direct cross -talk between 
HER2/HER3 and ER with phosphorylation of ER only observed in cells expressing both HER2 and ER  
or HER3 and ER  (Collins et al., 2017) . The authors use d an in vivo  mouse model of ER+/HER2 -low 
(HER2 IHC 1+ or 2+ without gene amplification) human breast cancer to evaluate a triple therapy 
targeting HER2 (pertuzumab), HER3 (lumretuzumab) and the ER (fulvestrant), resulting in long -lasting 
tumor regression.  
Preclinical studies support  that adding MCLA -128 to hormonal treatment could delay or reverse 
resistance to therapy in ER+ HER2 - (HER2  IHC 1+ or 2+ by HercepTest™) breast cancer. MCLA -128 with 
anti-ER drugs (tamoxifen and fulvestrant) combined with the AI letrozole was evaluated in tw o in vivo  
xenograft models of ER+ HER2 -low breast cancer. All hormon e therapies reduced tumor growth, while 
MCLA -128 single agent had no efficacy. However, when MCLA -128 was added to the hormon e therapy 
regimen, it led to a further decrease d in  tumor growth. Mechanistically, HER2 expression was 
increased with fulvestrant and tamoxifen, which is supported by published studies (Osipo et al., 2007; 
García -Becerra et al., 2012) . When MCLA -128 was added to anti -ER drugs, this increase in HER2 could 
be reversed. Most importantly, a proximity ligation assay showed that fulvestrant treatment 
upregulated the formation of HER2:HER3 d imers and enhanced activati on of the Akt signaling 
pathway, which could be inhibited by adding MCLA -128. Together, these data show that the efficacy 
of hormonal therapies may be limited due to activation of the HER2/HER3 signaling axis, which could 
be reve rsed by MCLA -128.  
While the in vivo  tumor models tested responded to hormonal therapy, there is also evidence that in 
the context of ET -resistant tumors , the inhibition of HER3 by MCLA -128 could be therapeutically 
beneficial , as suggested by Collins et al.  (2017) . The MCF -7 cell line  engineered to respond to AIs w as 
initially sensitive to letrozole, but tumors subsequently became resistant (Curley et al., 2015) . The 
addition of an anti -HER3 antibody at the start of treatment was more effective than hormone therapy  
alone, as observed for MCLA -128. Importantly, the combination of the anti -HER3 with hormone 
therapy  after resistance restore d antitumor activity. This was not the case when the anti -HER3 was 
given as single agent, demonstrating that hormone receptor and HER3 inhibition  work in synergy 
before and after the occurrence of HT resistance.  
In patients with ER -positive/low HER2 expression MBC, based on this strong preclinical evidence, a 
rescue approach will be used to evaluate the effect of the addition of MCLA -128 on the natural history 
of the disease when treated with ET.

PROPERTY OF MERUS N.V.   CONFIDENTIAL  Page 43 of 127 1.3.3 Rationale for MCLA -128 Combination Therapy Study Design  
The study will be carried out  in two distinct patient populations, HER2 -positive/ amplified MBC who 
will be treated with MCLA -128 and trastuzumab ± chemotherapy (Cohort 1), evaluated as doublet and 
triplet combinations, and ER -positive/low HER2 expression MBC patients who will be treat ed with 
MCLA -128 combined with the same ET that each patient progressed on immediately prior to study 
entry (Cohort 2).  
The RP2D of 750 mg MCLA -128 IV, over 2 hours, q3w , was established in the phase  1/2 dose escalation 
study, a dose  shown to be well toler ated.  Mandatory p remedication with all MCLA -128 infusions has 
been implemented to mitigate IRRs , and  the infusion duration can be extended from 2 to 4 hours to  
further  improve infusion tolerance. MCLA -128 is very well tolerated with few and mainly mild to 
moderate tox icities and p otential toxicity associated with  the proposed combination agents is 
expected to be manageable ; the IRRs reported with MCLA -128 at the RP2D were almost all grade 1 or 
2 and were managed with medication, while the introduction of mandatory premedication improved 
management of this toxicity . Clinical cardiac toxicity has not been reported, and gastroi ntestinal 
toxicity is grade 1 or 2.  
The study design allows for cautious verification of the safety of combin ing two anti -HER2 monoclonal 
antibodies  in Cohort 1, at multiple levels. The  initial administration of the doublet agents, MCLA -128 
and trastuzumab  will be on  consecutive days. Consecutive administration but on the same day is 
anticipated for subsequent cycles if the combination is considered well tolerated . Su bsequent 
evaluation of administration of the two antibodies from treatment initiation will be investigated in 
patients enrolled later,  to support a practical administration regimen in the long -term . The same 
principle will be  applied for assessment of the triplet combination , with the antibody doublet 
administration initially, followed by chemot herapy the next day . In addition , the doublet and triplet 
combinations themselves will be evaluated sequentially to ensure safety. The implementation of a 
safety run -in evaluation in a small group of patients  for each combination will provide safety data 
before committing to continuing full recruitment.

PROPERTY OF MERUS N.V.   CONFIDENTIAL  Page 45 of 127 3 STUDY DESIGN  AND  DURATION  
3.1 Study Design  
This is a phase 2 , open -label, multicenter international study to evaluate the efficacy of MCLA -128-
based combinations in two metastatic breast cancer (MBC) populations, HER2 -positive/amplified 
(Cohort 1) and ER -positive/low HER2 expression (Cohort 2).  
Three combination treatment s will be evaluated , two in Cohort 1 and one in Cohort 2 . A total of up to 
120 evaluable patients will be included in approximately  20-30 centers in  7 countries in Europe and 
the USA . 
Cohort 1:  Patients with HER2 -positive/amplified MBC, having confirmed HER2 overexpression by 
immunohistochemistry (IHC) 3+ or IHC 2+ combined with positive fluorescence in situ  hybridization 
(FISH), who have been treated with up to a maximum of 5 lines of HER2 -directed therapy in the 
metastatic setting and have progressed on the most recent line as per RECIST v1.1 , are eligible. 
Patients must have been treated previously with  trastuzumab , pertuzumab and an HER2 ADC  in any 
sequence and in any setting . For enrollment, HER2 status will be based on medical r ecords, and 
eligibility will be confirmed subsequently as soon as possible, by central lab review. Patients found to 
be ineligible retrospectively will not be evaluable for the primary objective and may be replaced. 
Documented imaging proof of disease prog ression on the last prior line of therapy should be made 
available  when possible .  
Initially MCLA -128 will be administered with trastuzumab (doublet combination). Safety will be 
reviewed by an Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC ). After the safety of the doublet has 
been assessed, MCLA -128 + trastuzumab + vinorelbine (triplet combination) will be evaluated in 
parallel with the doublet combination (see Figure 3-1 below).  
The doublet and triplet Cohort 1 combinations will both be evaluated in two step s with an initial 
safety run -in in 4 to 6 patients who will be reviewed by the IDMC,  followed by a cohort efficacy 
expansion, as described below. The triplet combination go/no -go decision will be made by the IDMC  
after evaluation of the doublet safety run -in patients . If the triplet combination is considered safe, 
the expansion of the doublet and triplet  combinations will be performed  in parallel . Patients with be 
included with a 3:1 ratio for triplet or doublet respectively, favoring the triplet combinatio n and 
taking into account previous exposur e to vinorelbine . 
 
Figure 3-1: Study design for Cohort 1 combination therapies (doublet and triplet)  
 
Safety run -in: After 4 -6 patients have received at least 2 complete cycles (6 weeks) of MCLA -128 + 
trastuzumab, a safety review will be performed  by the IDMC . If the doublet combination is considered 
safe, the safety run -in for the triplet combination will be initiated  in the next 4 to 6 successive eligible 
patients . Safety of the triplet will be evaluated by the IDMC  after these 4-6 patients have received at 
least 2 complete cycles (6 weeks) of MCLA -128 + trastuzumab + vinorelbine.  

Protocol  MCLA -128-CL02  Version 5.0, 11 April 2022  
 
 
 
PROPERTY OF MERUS N.V.   CONFIDENTIAL  Page 46 of 127 Based on the observed safety in the fi rst 4-6 patients (adverse events [AEs], serious adverse events 
[SAEs], relationship to study drug, and other clinical ly relevant parameters [e.g. laboratory 
parameters] , available PK, immunogenicity, and cytokine data ) the  IDMC,  investigators and Sponsor 
will decide on a potential additional run -in period for each combination (i.e. doublet and triplet).  
Expansion:  After the safety run -in, each Cohort 1 combination therapy considered tolerable by the 
IDMC will be expanded to a to tal of up to 40 patients evaluable for efficacy.  
If the doublet combination regimen is not tolerated, Cohort 1 will be closed. If the triplet combination 
is not well tolerated but the doublet is acceptable, the doublet expansion will be continued.  
Cohort  2: Patients with ER-positive and low HER2 expression MBC (IHC 1+, or IHC 2+ combined with 
negative FISH) who have  radiologic or  photographic evidence of  disease progression  on the last line 
of prior endocrine therapy (administered for at least 12 weeks) t hat included an aromatase inhibitor 
or fulvestrant. Patients who  have received up to 3 prior endocrine therapies in the metastatic setting 
and have progressed  on a cyclin -dependent kinase inhibitor (in any line)  are eligible . For enrollment, 
HER2  and HR  status and radiologic /photographic  document ation of  prior progression will be based on 
medical records . Eligibility will be confirmed as soon as possible for HER2/HR status by central lab 
review and for prior disease progression by central imaging review.  Patient s found to be ineligible 
retrospectively will not be evaluable for the primary objective and may  be replace d. 
MCLA -128 will be administered in combination with the same previous endocrine therapy on which 
progressive disease is radiologically /photo graphically  documented. A total of  up to 40 patients 
evaluable for efficacy will be included.  
Figure 3-2: Study design for Cohort 2 combination therapies  
 
The IDMC will meet to review safety and efficacy data at select time points during the study (e.g. 
completion of safety run in, completion of enrollment), according to a n IDMC  Charter  (see section 
8.12 ). 
Imaging for all patients will be reviewed centrally to confirm on -study disease assessments for analysis 
of efficacy endpoints.  
All patients will receive MCLA -128 at 750 mg IV over 2 hours, Day 1, q3w , with 3 -week cycles until 
disease pr ogression or unacceptable toxicity (see also section 5.4). Trastuzumab  and vinorelbine will 
be administered according to standard doses and regimens , and endocrine  therapy will be 
administered as  the same dose and regimen of the last line of endocrine therapy received prior to 
study entry  on which the patient progressed .  
3.2 Study Duration  
Recruitment  in this study has been closed and there remain a few patients  on tre atment who have all 
been on treatment for at least 24 months at the time of Protocol Version  5.0 implementation.

been treated for at least 2 years and continue to benefit from the study drug, to roll over in an 
alternative program e.g.  Post-study or  Expand ed Access Use .  Patients who will continue in this 
protocol, will only be followed for local efficacy , related adverse event s, all related Serious Adv erse 
Events and LVEF.  After treatment withdrawal patient s should attend the  combined  EOT and Follow -
Up visit 35 ± 5 days after the last treatment administration.  
The study will be closed after the last patient on study has been followed -up for 35 ± 5 days after the  
last treatment administration  or after the last patient is rolled over into an alternative program.  
Protocol Version 5.0  is applicable for the few patients who currently remain on treatment. Any 
patients who discontinued their t reatment and are i n Follow -Up at the time of amendment, w ill be 
assessed as per the previous Protocol Version 4.0.

this study. In short, t he required volume of formulated MCLA -128 to be injected  (37.5 mL ) is first 
removed from the saline bag  (containing 250 mL)  using a sterile syring e and a sterile 18 -22G needle. 
The same volume of MCLA -128 (37.5 mL to give a 750 mg flat dose ) is then added to the saline bag 
using a sterile syringe and an 18 -22G needle. Upon mixing, the saline infusion bag can be kept at room

infusion bag cont aining MCLA -128 can be kept at 2 -8°C for up to 24 hours prior to the start of infusion  
and a subsequent 4 hours at room temperature . 
If the MCLA -128-containing saline infusion bag has been stored at 2 -8°C, it should be allowed to reach 
room temperature (ap proximately 30 mi nutes prior to administration).  A DEHP -free PVC infusion set 
containing an in -line 0.2 µm filter must be used to connect to the IV  catheter. Flush the  infusion line 
with NaCl 0.9%. The priming volum e depends on the infusion line.  The entir e content of the infusion 
bag must be administered. The infusion rate should be adjusted accordingly to ensure the infusion is 
complet e in approximately 120 minutes.  After the end of the infusion, the infusion line must be 
flushed with NaCl 0.9% at the sam e rate to ensure the dosing is complete.   
5.2.2 Companion Study Drugs  
For trastuzumab, vinorelbine and endocrine therapies , refer to the  most recent local SPC for drug

5.3 Study Drug s Administration  
5.3.1 Study Drugs  
5.3.1.1  MCLA -128 and Premedication  
Premedication with paracetamol /acetaminophen , antihistamines, and corticosteroids is mandatory 
immediately before  every MCL A-128 administration. A recommended regimen is provided below :  
• Paracetamol / acetaminophen  1000 mg PO or IV  
• Dexchlorpheniramine 5 mg IV (or equivalent by PO or IV)  
• Dexamethasone 10 mg IV (or equivalent by PO or IV)  
The investigator can use equivalent drugs (e.g. prednisone instead of dexamethasone) and doses, in 
accordance with local standard practices.  
A flat dose of 750 mg MCLA -128 will be infused intravenously over 2 hours , on D ay 1 every 3 weeks. 
The infusion duration may be extended up to ~4 hours where considered appropriate to avoid or 
reduce the incidence or severity of IRR s. 
5.3.1.2  Trastuzumab  
Trastuzumab will be administered as an 8 mg/kg IV loading dose over 90 minutes for Cycle 1, then  6 
mg/kg for subsequent cyc les. For Cycle 2, the trastuzumab administration should be maintained at 90 
min, and over 30 -90 minutes thereafter. The trastuzumab dose should be recalculated if the patient’s 
body weight changes by more than ± 10% from baseline.  When trastuzumab is admin istered on the 
same day as MCLA -128, the infusion is initiated 30 minutes after the end of the MCLA -128 infusion.  
Refer also to the most recent local SPC (see Appendix 19.5 ). 
5.3.1.3  Vinorelbine  
Vinorelbine will be administered as an IV dose of 25 mg/m² over 10 minutes.  A maximum  body surface 
area of 2 m² should be used.  When vinorelbine is administered on the same day as MCLA -128 and

5.3.1.4  Endocrine therapies  
For e ndocrine therapy, patients will receive the same dose and regimen as that administered as the 
last line of endocrine therapy prior to study entry on which the patient progressed.  
Standard endocrine therapy doses and regimens are  (refer also to the most recent local SPC; see 
Appendix 19.5 ): 
• Fulvestra nt 500 mg, administered intramuscularly into the buttocks slowly (1 -2 minutes per 
injection) as two 5 mL injections, one in each buttock, on Days 1, 15, 29, an d once every 28 days 
thereafter . Day 15 treatment  will not be administered in p atients with <40 days since the last 
fulvestrant administration prior to study entry.  
• Exemestane 25 mg per os, administer ed once daily (QD), after food . 
• Letrozole 2.5 mg per os,  administered QD . 
• Anastrazol e 1 mg per os, administered QD . 
5.3.2 Combination Treatment Schedule s  
Three combination trea tment regimens  are planned, two in Cohort 1 and one in C ohort 2:  
• Cohort 1 HER2 -positive/amplified : an MCLA -128 + trastuzumab (doublet combination) will be 
evaluated initially, followed  by an MCLA -128 + trastuzumab + vinorelbine (triplet combination) 
after safety of the doublet has been established  and which will be evaluated in parallel with the 
doublet . 
• Cohort 2 hormone receptor -positive /low HER2 expression : MCLA -128 + endocrine therap y 
combination . 
For all combinations, a  treat ment cycle is 21 days (3 weeks) , including Cohort 2 which may include 
q4w fulvestrant dosing. Day 1 of t he subsequent cycle will be on D ay 22 or after recovery from any 
AEs asso ciated with the previous cycle.  
A 6-hour observation period  will be implemented following infusion start for the initial  MCLA -128 
and/or trastuzumab  administration , and 2  hours for all subsequent administrations  (i.e. when a single 
antibody  - MCLA -128 or trastuzumab  - is administered on a  given day, or after trastuzumab when they 
are administered on the same day ).

5.3.3 Dose Adaptation  
5.3.3.1  MCLA -128 and Trastuzumab  
Action s to take in the event of toxicity related to MCLA -128 and/or trastuzumab are summarized 
below. See Section 8.8 for additional details of AEs of special interest (IRRs, cardiotoxicity and 
diarrhea).  
Interruptions:  MCLA -128 and trastuzumab infusions  must  be interrupted  in the event of an IRR. IRRs 
inclu de the preferred term (PT) “IRR” and any other PTs occur ring within 24 hours of the MCLA -128 
or trastuzumab infusion that the investigator judges as a sign or symptom of an IRR (e.g., nausea, 
vomiting, abdominal pain, headache, hypotension, pyrexia, tremor , and hypersensitivity).  
The infusion should be stopped immediately, and the patient should receive symptomatic treatment 
according to  the investigator’s or treating physician’s judgment .  
For non -severe IRRs, the  MCLA -128 or trastuzumab  infusion can be  re-started upon clinical 
improvement  of symptoms , at 50% of the infusion rate prior to the reaction  and the infusion duration 
can be increased to 4 hours , to adm inister the totality of the dose .  
For severe IRRs (CTCAE grade 4, life -threatening), MCLA -128 or trastuzumab  infusion  should be 
stopped immediately and all study treatment discontinued definitively .  
For IRRs considered to be due to an IgE -mediated anaphylactic reaction, the MCLA -128 or trastuzumab 
infusion should be interrupted and not resumed, i rrespective of the severity of the reaction, and is 
contraindicated for subsequent cycles.  
Delays:  Planned MCLA -128 and trastuzumab administration can be delayed for up to 1 cycle (i.e., a 
maximum 6 -week interval between infusions), in the event of the following : 
• Cardiotoxicity : In the event of LVEF <  50% with a decline of ≥ 10 ejection fraction points or LVEF 
≤ 44%, antibody administration will be delayed for 3 weeks and another LVEF evaluation 
performed. In the absence of improvement or if the patient has a confirmed documented LVEF

PROPERTY OF MERUS N.V.   CONFIDENTIAL  Page 56 of 127 decrease to a value ≤ 44% or clinical signs and symptoms suggesting congestive heart failure, both 
antibodies will be withdrawn . See Appendix 19.3  for the algorithm for treatment management in 
the event of cardi otoxicity . 
• Diarrhea : In the event of persistent grade 2 (>  48 hours) or grade 3 -4 diarrhea, administration of 
MCLA -128 and trastuzumab  should be delayed  (for a maximum of 6 weeks between i nfusions) .  
Reductions:  Dose reductions are not permitted  for MCLA -128 or trastuzumab . 
Incomplete trastuzumab loading dose:  
• If the patient receives < 50% of the Cycle 1 loading dose, the  remainder should be administered 
before Day 22, preferably within the first week. Thereafter, the usual maintenance dose  should 
be administered  3 weeks after the first interrupted dose, as scheduled ; e.g., if a patient received 
up to 50% of the scheduled  loading dose, the remaining dose  should b e administered , preferably 
in the first week, then  regular maintenanc e doses (6 mg/kg of trastuzumab ) from  Day 22, as 
scheduled.  
• If the patient receives between 50 -75% of the Cycle 1 loading dose, the  remainder  should be 
administered  before Day 22, prefera bly within  the first 2 weeks of Cycle 1; e.g. , if ~60% of the 
scheduled loading dose  is administered , the remaining 40% should be administered preferably 
within 2 weeks , then regular maintenance doses (6 mg/kg of trastuzumab) from Day 22, as 
scheduled . 
• If the patient receives ≥  75% of the Cycle 1 loading dose, additional loading is probably not  
necessary , however, the remainder of the loading dose may be given at the investigator's  
discretion. In this case, the remainder may be given at any time before the next  scheduled dose 
or the patient may be given an additional loading dose on Day 22.  
If, after receiving an incomplete loading dose on Day 1, the patient cannot attend the site  until Day 
22, a seco nd loading dose  should be given on Day 22. However,  every effort should be made to give 
the remainder of the dose prior to Day 22 . 
5.3.3.2  Vinorelbine  
Dose reductions and delays are required in the event of toxicity as  follows:  
Hematologic Toxicity:   
Hold or decrease the vinorelbine dose in patients with decreased neutrophil counts using the following 
schema.  
Neutrophils on Day of Treatment (cells/mm3)  Percentage of Starting Dose  
≥ 1,500 (≥ grade 1)  100%  
< 1,500 (grade 2) Do not administer. Repeat neutrophil count in 1 week. If  
treatment is delayed due to  neutrophil count < 1, 500 
cells/mm3 for ≥3 consecutive weeks , discontinue 
vinorelbine  
Note : For patients who experience fever and/or sepsis while neutrophil count is < 1,500 or had 2 
consecutive weekly doses held due to neutropenia, subsequent doses should be:  
> 1,500 (≥ grade 1)  75%  
< 1,500 (grade 2) Do not administer.  
Repeat neutrophil count in 1 week.  
Protocol  MCLA -128-CL02  Version 5.0, 11 April 2022  
 
 
 
PROPERTY OF MERUS N.V.   CONFIDENTIAL  Page 57 of 127 Vinorelbine should be held if a patient experiences a reduction in platelets  to <100 ,000 cells /mm3 and 
counts repeated 1 week  later . If treatment is delayed due to platelets  to <100 ,000 cells/mm3 for ≥3 
consecutive weeks, discontinue vinorelbine . 
Hepatic Impairment/Toxicity : Reduce vinorelbine dose in patients with elevated serum total bilirubin 
concentration according to the following schema.  
Serum total bilirubin concentration (mg/dL)  Percentage of Starting Dose  
≤ 2.0  100%  
2.1 to 3.0  50%  
> 3.0  25%  
Concurrent Hematologic Toxicity and Hepatic Impairment:  Administer the lower doses based on the 
corresponding starting dose of vinorelbine determined from the above schemas.  
Neurologic Toxicity:  Discontinue vinorelbine  for NCI -CTCAE  v. 4.0 3 ≥ grade 2 peripheral neuropathy or 
autonomic neuropathy causing constipation.  
5.3.3.3  Endocrine Therapies  
Treatment adaptations for endocrine therapies will be as per the SPC. Note that for fulvestrant : 
Delays:  In cases of fulvestrant -related toxicity  as per investigator’s judgement , the injection can be 
delayed for up to 7 days, after which the planned monthly injection should be skipped.  Fulvestrant 
should not be administered if the platele t count is <  50,000/mm3. 
Reductions:  Dose reductions are not permitted.  
5.3.3.4  Supportive Care Guidelines for Study Treatment Toxicity  
Toxicity will be managed by the investigator according to the local standard of care. Supportive 
treatment must be reported in the concomitant medication section of the eCRF.  
5.4 Treatment Withdrawal  
Study treatment  will be administered until any of the following occurs, at which point it will be 
definitively discontinued, except in cases of perceived benefit and in agreement with the  Sponsor:  
• Confirmed progressive disease (as per RECIST)  
• Unacceptable toxicity (including a confirmed documented LVEF decrease to a value <40% or 
clinical signs and symptoms suggesting congestive heart failure)  
• Withdrawal of consent  
• Patient non -compliance  
• Investigator decision (e.g. clinical deterioration ; in the rare event that  a patient discontinues due 
to global deterioration of health status considered related to the underlying disease but without 
objective evidence of disease progression at that time, it should be reported as “symptomatic 
deterioration” – all efforts should be made to document objective progression ) 
• Treatment interruption > 6 consecutive weeks  
• Withdrawal of any of the study drugs  (MCLA -128, trastuzumab, vinorelbine or endocrine

In all cases, the reason for and date of study treatment discontinuation must be recorded in the eCRF 
and documented in the patient's medical records. As far as possible, there should be only one reason 
for treatment discontinuation. If several reasons  apply (e.g. concomitant progressive disease and 
toxicity) the primary reason must be reported.  
As far as possible, all examinations scheduled for the final study day must be performed for all patients 
who receive any study medication  but who do not compl ete the study according to protocol.  
The investigator must make every effort to contact patients lost to follow -up, especially when a 
patient is treated in another non -study center.

PROPERTY OF MERUS N.V.   CONFIDENTIAL  Page 69 of 127 7.1 Screening , Eligibility and Enro lment Procedures  
Each candidate patient will be examined before starting the study to determine eligibility for 
participation  (as per Table 7-1, Table 7-2 and Error! Reference source not found. ). This must be done 
within 28 days  prior to the first study treatment administration .  
All patients must provide written informed consent prior to any specific study procedure s being 
performe d. 
A centralized patient enrolment  process will be used to track patient screening and planned timing of 
Cycle 1, Day 1. The investigator (or designee) must verify that the patient meets eligibility criteria and 
has signed the Informed Consent Form, then request patient inclusion by faxing/e -mailing the Patient 
Enrolment Request Form  (provided separately)  to the Sponsor ’s Medical expert  (or designee)  as 
specified on the form.   
Patient s must be approved for enrolment by the Sponsor prior to treatment start . For Cohort 1, e ligible 
patients will be allocated centrally by the Sponsor to the doublet or triplet regimen  (when both 
expansion phases are running in parallel)  as follows. After completion of the evaluation of the doublet 
safety run -in patients, if the doublet combination is considered toxic, all inclusions in Cohort 1 will be 
stopped . If the doublet is considered safe, the next 4 to 6 eligible successive patients will be treated 
with  the triplet combination. If the triplet combination is considered toxic  in these patients, further 
exploration of the triplet combination will be stopped, and only the doublet combination will be 
evaluated  for efficacy . If both the doublet and triplet combinations are considered safe, they will be 
expanded for efficacy evalua tion in parallel. E ligible patients will  be allocated centrally by the S ponsor 
to one of the two cohorts using a 3:1 ratio for the  triplet or doublet respectively and taking into 
account previous exposur e to vinorelbine . For Cohort 2, no treatment assignme nt is required.  
After validation of eligibility (as per Request Form , the enrolment form signed by the Sponsor’s 
Medical Monitor or designee will be returned to the investigator  within 24 hours (on working days) , 
with or without inclusion agreement. For pa tients not included, the reason for inclusion refusal will be 
specified.  
Patients who signed an Informed Consent Form but who failed to start treatment will be considered 
a screen failure and  reported on the screening log in the Investigator Site File.  Screen failures will not 
be reported in the eCRF.  If the patient is screened and not enrolled, only SAEs suspected to be caused 
by study procedures should be reported.    
Patients who are enrolled but are not treated will be reported in the eCRF. eCRF page s for 
demographic information, informed consent, inclusion/exclusion and the “leading question” on the 
AE (to confirm if any AEs occurred during screening) must also be completed for screen failure 
patients. No other data will be entered into the clinical database for these patients unless they 
experience d an SAE during the screening phase.  
For included patients, the patient cohort and combination therapy arm allocated will be specified on 
the form, along with a unique patient number. Included patients will  only receive a unique patient 
number  when treatment is about to be started, which must be within 7 days after enrolment .  
The unique patient number  will consist of 6 digits (2 for the center , 1 for the cohort, and 3 for the 
patient  by consecutive increasi ng order of i nclusion; XX -X-XXX) . Once a number has been assigned, it 
must not be used again.

PROPERTY OF MERUS N.V.   CONFIDENTIAL  Page 70 of 127 7.2 Evaluations On-Study  
On-study evaluations will be performed  as per the tables of assessments ( Table 7-1, Table 7-2, and 
Error! Reference source not found. ). A ±  3 day window is permitted for visit timing  with the 
exception of the first follow -up tumor assessment at Day 43 which m ust only have a +3 day window. 
All safety assessments should occur prior to dosing on each scheduled dosing day and the results 
should be available prior t o deciding to dose on that day.  With the implementation of Protocol 
Version 5.0  imaging assessments should occur every 6 12 weeks  and their timing should not be 
influenced by  dose delays or interruptions. Tumor biopsies for biomarker collection should coincide 
with the imaging assessment schedule.  
7.3 End of Treatment Visit and Follow -Up  
A visit will be performed 35 days (±  5 days) after the last study drug  intake as per Table 7-1, Table 
7-2, and Error! Reference source not found. .  
After the last treatment administration, patients will be followed up for safety for 30 days and then 
until resolution of any TEAEs for which a relationship to s tudy drug cannot definitely be excluded (or 
categorized as sequelae).  
In addition, patients will be follow ed 35 ± 5 days after the last treatment intake, as per Table 7-1, 
Table 7-2, and Error! Reference source not found. , as follows:  
• Patients who discontinue treatment for reasons other than disease progression will be followed -
up for tumor assessmen ts (imaging and tumor markers), disease progression, start of  a new 
anticancer therapy, or 35 ± 5 days after the last treatment intake , whichever is earlier.  
• Patients who discontinue treatment due to a drop in LVEF will have MUGA/ultrasound as clinically 
indicated  (≤18 weeks between assessments ) until initiation of a new anticancer therapy, 
resolution of LVEF to ≥50% , or 35 ± 5 days after the last treatment intake , whichever is earlier.  
• All patients will undergo LVEF 35 ± 5 days after the last  MCLA -128 dose.   
• All patients will be followed up for survival status, related cardiac events and suspected related 
SAEs  for up to 35 ± 5 days  after the last treatment intake . 
 
8 SAFETY ASSESSMENT S 
In emergency situations, the investigator should immediately contact a Sponsor representative at 
the telephone number or email address given on the title page of this protocol.  
Patients will be monitored for signs and symptoms of AEs throughout the study by a qualified 
oncologist, with experience in clinical research. All AEs will be reported in the eCRF, including 
seriousness, NC I-CTCAE v . 4.03 grade severity, causal relationship to the study medication, and 
action taken. The first concern will be the safety of the study participant.  
Incidence, severity and relationship of AEs and laboratory abnormalities, SAEs, discontinuations and 
dose adaptations due to AEs will be recorded.  
8.1 Clinical Safety  
Clinical and physical examinations, as well as vital signs evaluation, will be performed. Patient data 
will be analyzed for evidence of cumulative toxicity with repeated cycles of therapy.  AEs and signs 
and symptoms of disease observed by the investigator (preferably by the same physician for a same 
Protocol  MCLA -128-CL02  Version 5.0, 11 April 2022  
 
 
 
PROPERTY OF MERUS N.V.   CONFIDENTIAL  Page 71 of 127 patient) or reported by patients will be recorded and graded acco rding to NCI -CTCAE v . 4.03 . All 
events , including those considered not related t o the study drug , must be  reported in the eCRF.   
[ https://evs.nci.nih.gov/ftp1/CTCAE/CTCAE_4.03/CTCAE_4.03_2010 -06-
14_QuickReference_8.5x11.pdf  ] 
If symptomatic clinical deterioration occur s while  progressive disease is evident from  the patient’s 
clinical symptoms but is not supported by  tumor measurements  or the investigator  elect s not to 
perform further disease assessments , the determination of  clinical progression is based on 
symptomatic deterioration. These determinations should  be a rare exception as every effort should 
be made to document the objective progression  of underlying malignancy  with imaging . If there is any 
uncertainty about an AE being due only to the disease under  study, it should be reported as an AE or 
SAE.  
8.2 Laboratory Measurements  
Clinical laboratory tests will be performed at local laboratories. Laboratory test results will be recorded 
on the laboratory results section of the eC RF. In addition, any laboratory result abnormality fulfilling 
the criteria for an  AE or  SAE should be reported as such. Any clinically significant treatment -emergent 
laboratory abnormality (accompanied with clinical symptoms, requiring a change in study medication 
[reduction, interruption, discontinuation] or requiring a change in concomitan t therapy) should be 
recorded as a single AE in the eCRF.

8.3 Definitions (21 CFR§312.32)  
• Adverse event (AE)  means any untoward medical occurrence associated with use of a drug in 
humans, whether or not considered drug related. The term treatment emergent  adverse event  
[TEAE] covers any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, syndrome, or illness that develops  
or worsens during the period of observation  after the first treatment administration  in the clinical 
study. Surgical or other procedures themselves are not TEAEs. The condition for which the 
surgery/other procedure is required, is a TEAE, if it occurs or is detected during the study period. 
Planned surgical or other procedures planned/permitted by the study protocol and the 
condition(s) leading to these measures are not TEAEs, if the condition(s) was (were) known before 
the start of study treatment. In the  latter case the condition should be reported as medical history . 
• Adverse drug reaction (ADR)  is an AE caused by the drug.  
Protocol  MCLA -128-CL02  Version 5.0, 11 April 2022  
 
 
 
PROPERTY OF MERUS N.V.   CONFIDENTIAL  Page 72 of 127 • Suspected adverse reaction (SAR)  is any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility that the 
drug caused the AE. A “reasonable pos sibility” means there is evidence to suggest a causal 
relationship between the drug and the AE. SAR implies a lesser degree of certainty about causality 
than an ADR, and include:  
-  A single occurrence of an event that is uncommon and known to be strongly associated with 
drug exposure;  
- One or more occurrences of an event that is not commonly associated with drug exposure, 
but is otherwise uncommon in the population exposed to the drug (e.g., tendon rupture);  
- An aggregate analysis of specific events obse rved in a clinical trial (such as known 
consequences of the underlying disease or condition under investigation or other events that 
commonly occur in the study population independent of drug therapy) that indicates those 
events occur more frequently in th e drug treatment group than in a concurrent or historical 
control group.   
• Serious adverse event (SAE)  or serious suspected adverse reaction (SSAR) is an event that, in the 
view of either the investigator or Sponsor, results in any of the following outcomes : 
- Death occurring on study or within 30 days after the last administration of study drug 
(regardless of relationship to study treatment) or within any interval if related to the study 
drug. Although death may occur as a result of the disease, all deaths oc curring within 30 days 
of the last administration of study drug must be managed as SAEs and reported as such;  
- A life -threatening AE;  
- Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization;  
- A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal 
life functions;  
- A congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
In addition, medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited 
reporting i s appropriate in situations where none of the outcomes listed above occurred. Important 
medical events that may not be immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospitalization but 
may jeopardize the patient’s safety or may require intervention to  prevent one of the outcomes listed 
in the definition above should also usually be considered serious. Examples of such events include:  
- Overd ose, even without complications  (see Section  8.11 ) 
- An AE requiring intensive treatment  without hospitalization  
- A diagnosis of a new cancer type during the course of a treatment  
- A pregnancy diagnosed in a female patient treat ed with the stud y medication  must be 
reported to the Sponsor immediately.  
See Section 8.10  for SAE reporting for pregnancies. Only  pregnancies with an outcome meeting any of 
the serious criteria defined above  (i.e., congenital anomaly, stillbirth, neonatal death)  should be 
reported as an SAE . For any pregnancy without an adverse outcome, the Investigator should complete 
the appropriate section of the SAE report form and state clearly that no AE was observed . 
Hospitalizations for the following reasons should not be reported as SAEs:  
- Routine treatment or monitoring of the studied indication, not associated with any 
deterioration in condition  
- Elective or pre -planned treatment for a pre -existing condition that is unrelated to the 
indication under study and has not worsened since signing the informed consent

PROPERTY OF MERUS N.V.   CONFIDENTIAL  Page 73 of 127 - Social reasons and respite care in the absence of any deterioration in the patient’s general 
condition  
- Treatment on an emergenc y outpatient basis that does not result in hospital admission and 
involves an event not fulfilling any of the definitions of a n SAE given above.   
Reporting disease progression as an SAE:  Progression of the underlying malignancy is not reported as 
an AE if it is clearly consistent with suspected progression of the underlying cancer as defined by 
RECIST, or other criteria as determined by the protocol. Clinical symptoms of progression should be 
reported as AEs/SAEs if there is any uncertainty that they are du e only to the progression of the 
underlying malignancy or they do not fit the expected pattern of progression for the disease under 
study . The PT “disease progression” should not be used.  
In rare cases, progression may be evident in the patient’s clinical  symptoms but is not supported by 
the tumor measurements, or disease progression is so evident that the investigator elects not to 
perform further disease assessments. Every effort should be made to document the radiologic 
objective progression of the unde rlying malignancy.  
• Life-threatening AE or life -threatening SAR is an AE that, in the view of either the investigator or 
Sponsor, places the patient at immediate risk of death. It does not include an AE or SAR that, had 
it occurred in a more severe form, m ight have caused death.  
• Unexpected AE or unexpected SAR is an AE or SAR that is not listed in the investigator brochure 
or is not listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed. For example, under this 
definition, hepatic necrosis would be unexpected (by virtue of greater severity) if the investigator 
brochure referred only to elevated hepatic enzymes or hepatitis. Similarly, cerebral 
thromboembolism and cerebral vasculitis would be unexpected (by virtue of greater specificity) if 
the invest igator brochure listed only cerebral vascular accidents. “Unexpected”, as used in this 
definition, also refers to AEs or SARs that are mentioned in the investigator brochure as occurring 
with a class of drugs or as anticipated from the pharmacologic proper ties of the drug, but are not 
specifically mentioned as occurring with the particular drug under investigation.  
8.4 Documentation  
All TEAEs occurring during the course of the study, whether or not considered related to the study 
drug or to underlying disease,  must be individually recorded in the eCRF, including the nature of the 
event, date and time of onset (where appropriate), duration of effect, action taken, seriousness, 
severity, and relationship to study medication. Any consequent change to the dosage sc hedule or 
corrective therapy should be recorded.  
Every attempt should be made to describe the TEAE in terms of a diagnosis. If a clear diagnosis has 
been made, individual signs and symptoms will not be recorded. If a clear diagnosis cannot be 
established,  each sign and symptom must be recorded individually.  
All patients who experience a TEAE, regardless of the relationship to study treatment, must be 
monitored to determine the outcome. The clinical course of the AE will be followed up even after the 
end of  the period of observation for related TEAEs, until a satisfactory explanation is found or the 
investigator considers it medically justifiable to terminate follow -up. Should the AE result in death, a 
post -mortem examination should be considered as far as p ossible.  
Protocol  MCLA -128-CL02  Version 5.0, 11 April 2022  
 
 
 
PROPERTY OF MERUS N.V.   CONFIDENTIAL  Page 74 of 127 After last study treatment administration, patients will be observed for at least 30 days  to document 
any late side effects and until resolution in cases of TEAEs for which a relationship to the study drugs  
cannot definitely be excluded.  Patients will be followed up until resolution or attribution of sequelae 
for any treatment -related AEs.  
AEs already recorded and designated as “continuing” should be reviewed at each subsequent 
assessment. If resolved, details are to be recorded in the eCRF. If an AE worsens in frequency of 
attacks/symptoms or in severity, a new record of the event must be started (i.e., distinct AE reports 
are required for differing frequencies and/or severity of the same event to enable comprehensive 
safety reports and later analy sis).  
Diagnostic and therapeutic non -invasive and invasive procedures, such as surgery, must be reported 
under “concomitant procedures” in the eCRF and not as an AE. The medical condition for which the 
procedure was performed must be reported.  
8.5 Grade and S everity  
All AEs, whether or not they are considered related to the study drug, must be graded using the NCI 
Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.03, which can be found at: 
http://evs.nci.nih.gov/ftp1/CTCAE/CTCAE_4.03_2010 -06-14_Qui ckReference_8.5x11.pdf. The worst 
grade is to be documented.  
AE grades usually reflect their severity, with grade 1 meaning “mild”, grade 2 meaning “moderate”, 
grade 3 meaning “severe”, grade 4 meaning “life -threatening” and grade 5 meaning “fatal”.  
The te rm “severity” is used to describe the intensity of an AE; the event itself, however, may be of 
relatively minor clinical significance (e.g., ‘severe’ headache). This is not the same as “serious”. 
Seriousness of AEs is based on the outcome/action of an AE a nd associated with events that pose a 
threat to a patient’s life or functioning  (see definition in Section 8.3 above) . 
Intensity of the AE will be evaluated using t he following criteria:  
● Mild:  The patient is aware of the sign or symptom, but finds it easily tolerated. The event is of 
little concern to the patient and of little clinical significance. The event is not expected to have any 
effects on the patient’s ove rall health or wellbeing.  
● Moderate:  The patient has discomfort enough to cause interference with or change in usual 
activities. The event is of some concern to the patient’s health or wellbeing and may require 
medical intervention and/or close follow -up. 
● Severe:  The AE interferes considerably with the patient’s usual activities. The event is of definite 
concern to the patient and/or poses substantial risk to the patient’s health or wellbeing. The event 
is likely to require medical intervention and/or cl ose follow -up and may be incapacitating or life -
threatening. Hospitalization and treatment may be required.  
8.6 Relationship to Study Treatment  
All TEAEs occurring during treatment with an investigational agent may be related to the 
investigational agent. All TEAEs, regardless of the supposed relationship to study treatment, must 
therefore be collected. However, the investigator often has arguments to think that a TEAE is or is not 
related to the study treatment. Albeit subjective, and susceptible to be challen ged, the assessment of 
relationship to study treatment is an important role of the investigator. Thus, the investigators should 
Protocol  MCLA -128-CL02  Version 5.0, 11 April 2022  
 
 
 
PROPERTY OF MERUS N.V.   CONFIDENTIAL  Page 75 of 127 decide, based on their knowledge and medical expertise, whether, in their opinion, an AE is 
“reasonably related” or “unlikely re lated” to the study treatment (or to study specific procedures).  
8.7 SAE Reporting Requirements  
SAEs and other AEs that fulfill a reason for expedited reporting to Pharmacovigilance (overdose and 
pregnancy) must be documented on the SAE Report Form at the time the SAE is detected. This form 
must be completed by the investigator and sent within 24  hours to the Sponsor’s Pharmacovigilance 
representative as per the contact details provided on the form.  
The SAE report form and guidelines for completing it are provided in the Investigator Study File. The 
Sponsor is responsible for ensuring that all legal reporting requirements are met.  
The initial report must be as complete as possible, including details of the current illness and AE(s), 
and an assessment of the causal relationship between the event(s) and the study medication . 
Information not available at the time of the initial report (e.g., an AE end date or laboratory values 
received after the report) must be documented on a follow -up SA E report form.  
The IDMC will be provided with monthly listings of suspected SAEs. Investigators will be informed of 
serious unexpected suspected AEs as per the standard reporting requirements .  
The Sponsor must immediate ly declar e all SUSARs result ing in death or endanger ing the life of a 
patient, and a follow -up report  must be provided  within the following 8 days. All other SUSARs must 
be declar ed within 15 days and follow -up report must be provided within  the following 8 days . 
8.8 AEs of Special Interest  
8.8.1 Infusion-related reactions  
Patients will be monitored closely during the MCLA -128 infusion period  for signs of IRRs. IRRs include 
the preferred term (PT) “IRR” and any other PTs occu rring within 24 hours of the MCLA -128 or 
trastuzumab infusion that the investigator judges as a sign or symptom of an IRR (e.g., nausea, 
vomiting, abdominal pain, headache, hypotension, pyrexia, tremor, and hypersensitivity).  
All p atients must be pre -medicated with antihistamines, paracetamol /acetaminophen  and 
cortico steroids before each MCLA -128 infusion. If an IRR develops during administration of MCLA -128, 
the infusion should be stopped immediately , receive symptomatic treatment according to  the 
investigator’ s or treating physician’s judgment (e.g. antipyretics, bronchodilators, oxygen, 
corticosteroids, and vasopressors, anti -IL-6 compounds), and the patient should be monitored until 
resolution of the symptoms and signs.   
Upon complete resolution of non -severe  IRRs, the infusion may be resumed at 50% of the infusion 
rate prior to the reaction  and the infusion duration can be increased to 4 hours, to admi nister the 
totality of the dose . For severe IRRs (CTCAE grade 4, life -threatening), study treatment  should be  
discontinued definitively . 
For IRRs considered to be due to an IgE -mediated anaphylactic reaction, the MCLA -128 infusion should 
not be resumed, irrespective of the severity of the reaction , and is contraindicated for subsequent 
cycles.  
Local irritation a t the injection site should  be treated according to routine  treatment guidelines.

PROPERTY OF MERUS N.V.   CONFIDENTIAL  Page 76 of 127 8.8.2 Cardiotoxicity  
Cardiac function will be assessed by evaluating LVEF  and 12 -lead ECG . The LVEF  assessment will be 
made preferably by echocardiogram (ECHO), although a multi ple gated acquisition (MUGA) scan may 
be used if this method is standard practice at the investigational site. One method of evaluation is 
adequate and the same method should be used for each assessment for an individual patient.  
With the implementation o f Protoco l Version 5.0 , LVEF and ECG assessments will be performed  every 
6 months  and at any time during the study if clinically indicated  and at the End Of Treatment visit 
(EOT) & Follow -up visit  
MCLA -128 will be discontinued in any patient with a confir med documented LVEF decrease to a value 
<40% , and/or if clinical signs and symptoms suggesting congestive heart failure develop.  These 
patients should continue LVEF assessments as clinically indicated ( ≤18 weeks between assessments), 
until LVEF values retu rn to ≥50% , or for 1 year , whichever is first . 
Appendix 19.3  provides the algorithm for performing any additional required assessments of LVEF, as 
well as the continuation or discontinuation of treatment with MCLA -128 and/or trastuzumab in study 
patien ts with asymptomatic decline in LVEF during study treatment.  
All related cardiac events will be followed up for 35+5 days after treatment discontinuation.  
8.8.3 Diarrhea  
Diarrhea is common with anti -HER2 therapies including monoclonal antibodies . Patients must b e 
advised to inform the medical team if they develop grade 1 or 2 diarrhea that does not resolve within 
48 h, or diarrhea with fever. Patients experiencing diarrhea should be managed rapidly, and 
investigators should make all efforts to determine if it is drug -related or due to a gastrointestinal 
infection. If grade 1 or 2 (<  48 h) diarrhea occurs , symptomatic measures should be initiated (e.g. 
loperamide and hydration ). If persistent grade 2 diarrhea (>  48 hours) or grade 3 occurs , patients must 
be evaluat ed in the clinic. Stool cultures should be performed and patients should be hospitalized and 
rehydrated with oral and IV fluids if necessary. Treatment delay is indicated until event resolution . 
Patients must be withdrawn if > 6 weeks between infusions . 
8.9 Period of Observation  
For the purposes of this study, the period of observation for collection of AEs extends from the start 
of treatment with the study drugs  until 3 5 ± 5  days after the last study dr ug administration. Related 
AEs and SAEs  that we re ongoin g at the time of the EO T visit  must continue to be monitored  during 
follow -up until resolution , stability (i .e. sequelae),  change of causality from related to non -related , or 
initiation of further antitumor therapy.  
If the investigator detects an SAE after  the end of the period of observation, and considers the event 
possibly related to prior study treatment, he/she should contact the Sponsor to determine how the 
AE should be documented and reported.  
All new related cardiac events  and new suspected related SAEs  will be followed up until resolution or 
stability or for 35 ± 5 days  after the last treatment administration  or until initiation of a new anticancer 
treatment, whichever occurs first . 
In addition, all patients will be followed up for up to 35 ± 5 days  after the last treatment administration  
or until initiation of a new anticancer treatment, whichever occurs first,  for disease status (patients 
who have not progressed at end of treatment) and survival status .

PROPERTY OF MERUS N.V.   CONFIDENTIAL  Page 77 of 127 8.10 Patients of Reproductive Potential  
Pregnant o r breast -feeding women are excluded from this study . Absence of pregnancy must be 
demonstrated by a serum test within 1 week  prior to initiating treatment or any study procedure with 
a potential risk to the fetus  and at the End of Treatment visit , and by urine testing on Day 1 of each 
cycle  from Cycle 2 , and every 3 months up to 7 months after  MCLA -128/trastuzumab discontinuation 
unless there is proven menopause ( >12 months of amenorrhea ) or surgical /chemical  castration.  
Female patients must not become pre gnant or start breast -feeding during the study, and women of 
childbearing potential  (i.e. without proven menopause ) must use medically effective contraception 
during the study and for 7 months after t he last MCLA -128/trastuzumab intake . 
In the event of a pregnancy during the course of this study, the Sponsor must be notified immediately 
and the patient should be immediately withdrawn from study. The investigator should counsel the 
patient, and discuss the risks of continuing with the preg nancy and the possible effects on the fetus. 
The pregnant patient should be followed during the entire course of the pregnancy and postpartum 
period.  
Parental and neonatal outcomes must be recorded even if they are completely normal and without 
AEs. Offspr ing should be followed up for at least 8 weeks after delivery. Longer observation periods 
may be determined by the Sponsor if an adverse outcome of the pregnancy was observed.  
Pregnancies occurring during the study up to 7 months after  the final dose of MCLA-128/trastuzumab 
must also be reported to the Sponsor’s Pharmacovigilance representative  on the appropriate section 
of the SAE report form, according to SAE reporting requirements (see Section 8.7). Note that a  
pregnancy is only considered an SAE if the outcome meets any of the serious criteria defined in Section 
8.3 (i.e., congenital anomaly, stillbirth, neonatal death). For any pregnancy without an adverse 
outcome, the Investigator should complete the appropriate section of the SAE report form and state 
clearly that no AE was observed.  
The following non -hormonal methods of contraception are  acceptable:  
• True abstinence when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of  the patient. [Periodic 
abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal  post -ovulation methods) and withdrawal are 
not acceptable methods of  contraception].  
• Patients with a sole partner  who is vasectomized (with appropriate post -vasectomy 
documentation of the absence of sperm in the ejaculate)  
Or two of the following effective forms of contraception:   
• Placement of intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS).  Consideration shou ld be given 
to the type of device being used, as there are  higher failure rates quoted for certain types, e.g. 
steel or copper wire. The  risks (in terms of potential stimulation of hormone -responsive breast 
cancer  by systemically absorbed hormones) and ben efits (effective contraception) of  hormone -
releasing IUDs/IUSs should also be carefully considered for  individual patients.  
• Condom with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/suppository  
• Occlusive cap (diaphragm or cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal  foam , gel, film, cream or 
suppository.   
The use of barrier contraceptives should always be supplemented with the use of  a spermicide. The 
following should be noted:  
Protocol  MCLA -128-CL02  Version 5.0, 11 April 2022  
 
 
 
PROPERTY OF MERUS N.V.   CONFIDENTIAL  Page 78 of 127 • Failure rates indicate that, when used alone, the diaphragm and condom are  not highly effective 
forms  of contraception. Therefore the use of additional  spermicides does confer additional 
theoretical contraceptive protection.   
• However, spermicides alone are ineffective at preventing pregnancy when  the whole ejaculate is 
spilled. Therefore, spermicides are not a barrier  method of contraception and should not be used 
alone.  
It should be noted that two forms of effective contraception are required. A  double barrier method is 
acceptable which is defined as condom and occlusive  cap (diaphragm or cervical/vault c aps) with 
spermicidal  foam/gel/film/cream/suppository.  
8.11 Misuse and Overdose  
Drug misuse and drug overdose for any of the study drugs should be reported to the Sponsor’s 
Pharmacovigilance representative  on the appropriate section of the SAE report form, according to SAE 
reporting requirements  (see Section 8.7), even if it does not result in an adverse outcome  (in which 
case it should be clearly stated that no AEs were observed) . 
Overdose with MCLA -128 is defined as any dose administration where >10% over the correct dose 
amount is administered , whether or not associated with an AE. Symptoms of overdose with MCLA -
128 are not yet known. In the case of accidental overdose, patients should be treated symptomatically. 
An antidote is not available.  See the SPCs for companion drugs as to  definition of overdose and  action 
to take . 
If the pharmacy discovers that an overdose has or may have been administered they must  contact the 
Investigator and study coordinator.  
8.12 Independent Data Monitoring Committee  
An Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) , composed of at least 2  physicians expert in the 
domain of early clinical development in MBC , will meet to review safety and efficacy data at select 
time points during the study (e.g. completion of safety run in, completion of enrollment), and decide 
on the addition of extra patients in the  expansion parts  in Cohort 1 , opening of the triple combination 
cohort, and any ad hoc  safety decisions. The principal investigators, the Sponsor’s medical expert(s) 
and other representatives may be called upon to assist as observers .  
The composition , fun ctioning ( meeting frequency , data received, etc.), and responsibilities  of the 
IDMC will be  detailed i n the IDMC C harter  (provided separately).  All decisions by the IDMC and their 
rationale will be recorded in meeting minutes . 
 
9 EFFICACY ASSESSMENTS  
9.1 RECIST Tumor Measurement and Analysis  
Efficacy will be measured in terms of tumor response according to RECIST criteria (version 1.1) 
(Eisenhauer et al., 2009) (Appendix 19.4 ).  
With the implementation of P rotocol version 5.0 , tumor measurements will be done  every 4 cycles 
(12 weeks) (chest,  abdomen and pelvis CT scan) until progression ; In case of symptomatic  signs of PD 
in between the assessments an unscheduled assessment must be performed to confirm progression; 
and at the End of Treatment /Follow -up visit for patients who discontinue for reasons other than  
progression, as clinically indicated .

body bone scan that are not otherwise seen on the chest , abdomen and pelvis CTs , and then repeated 
at the same frequency as the chest , abdomen and pelvis exams . A brain MRI or CT will be performed

Note:  Clinical lesions  will only be considered measurable when they are superficial and ≥10 mm 
diameter as assessed using calipers (for example, skin nodules). Skin lesions  must be  documented by 
color photography, including a ruler to estimate  the size of the lesion.  If the skin lesion has a 
subcutaneous soft tissue component a localized CT sh ould be performed if it is not visible on the chest 
abdomen and pelvis CT/MRI.

For Cohort 2, eligibility will be confirmed in terms of prior disease progression on or after the most 
recent line of therapy by central imaging review as soon as possible after enrolment, and it is 
mandatory that prior imaging be available. For Co hort 1, as far as possible, documented imaging proof 
of disease progression on the last prior line of therapy should be made available.

relative to baseline, makes the disease PD at that point (since disease must have reappeared after CR). Best response 
would depend on whether minimum duration for SD was met. However, sometimes CR may be claimed when subsequent 
scans suggest small lesions were likely still present and in fact the patient had PR, not CR at the first time point. Under 
these circumstances, t he original CR should be changed to PR and the best response is PR.

PROPERTY OF MERUS N.V.   CONFIDENTIAL  Page 82 of 127 In the rare event that a patient experiences global deterioration of health status considered related 
to the underlying malignant disease which requires discontinuation of treatment but without 
objective evidence of disease progression at that time, they should be reported as “symptomatic 
deterioration” as the cause of treatment discontinuation. Every effort should be made to document 
the objective progression even after discontinuation o f treatment .  
For equivocal findings of progression (e.g. very small and uncertain new lesions; cystic changes or 
necrosis in existing lesions), treatment may continue until the next scheduled assessment. If at the 
next scheduled assessment, progression is  confirmed, the date of progression should be the earlier 
date when progression was suspected.  
In some circumstances it may be difficult to distinguish residual disease from normal tissue. When the 
evaluation of complete response depends upon this determin ation, it is recommended that the 
residual lesion be investigated (fine needle aspirate/biopsy) before confirming the complete response 
status.  
Carcinomatous meningitis diagnosed by cytologic evaluation of cerebral spinal fluid will also be 
defined as prog ressive disease. Medical photography can be used to monitor chest wall recurrences 
of subcutaneous lesions.  
In Cohort 2 , in the absence of measurable disease at baseline , patients with bone -only lesions, lytic  
or mixed (lytic + sclerotic), will be allowed to enter the study . 
 
The following will be considered disease progression among these patients:  
• The appearance of one or more new lytic lesions in bone 
• The appearance of one or more new lesions outside of bone  
• Unequivocal progression of existing bone lesions  
 
Note: Pathologic fracture, new compression fracture, or complications of bone  metastases will not 
be considered as evidence of disease progression, unless one of the  above -mentioned criteria is 
fulfilled . 
9.2 Tumor Markers  
The tumor markers CA15 -3, CE A, and CA27 -29 will be assessed  on Day 1 of every cycle  as part of 
routine laboratory analyses . As far as possible, measures should be made in the same laboratory. 
Evolution of each tumor marker will be followed throughout treatment.

PROPERTY OF MERUS N.V.   CONFIDENTIAL  Page 85 of 127 11.1.1  Tumor sample  
A mandatory formalin -fixed paraffin -embedded (FFPE) tumor sample  is required from  all patients 
(both cohorts) at screening  for HER2 status and exploratory biomarkers for all patients, and  for HR 
status for Cohort 2 . The tumor sample can be either a fresh sample or an archival sample collected 
within 24 months  before screening . All efforts should be made to obtain a fresh tumor sample. T he 
tumor sample  should preferably be from a metastatic site , otherwise primary tissue  is acceptable.   
Due to the difficult y to asse ss HER2 expression using IHC and FISH in bone tissue, a primary  FFPE tumo r 
specimen will be used for biomarker analyses  in the event that Cohort 2 patients have bone -only 
disease , unless it is determined that testing for HER2 expression in a bone biopsy is possible.  
 
Table 11-1: Tumor biomarker sampling  
Sample  Time Point  
FFPE tumor sample  
(one sample per time 
point)  Screening:  A fresh tumor sample OR an archival sample collected within 24 
months before screening  (preferably metastatic  otherwise primary )*.  
12 weeks from the start of first study treatment  (optional): Fresh tumor 
sample.  
EOT, within 35 days of last treatment  (optional): Fresh tumor sample.  
*For Cohort 2 patients with bone -only disease, primary tumor tissue will be used (unless it is determined that testing 
for HER2 expression in a bone biopsy is possible ) 
 
FFPE tissue blocks must have a tumor content > 40%. A block of adequate size (at least  5 mm deep 
core with a surface area of 2.5 mm²) or a minimum of 30 unbacked glass slides , each containing a  
freshly cut  unstained 4 -5 µm  section , is required  (separate instructions will be provided for slide 
shipping ). 
Samples will be sent to the sponsor -designated central laboratories for assessment of HER2 and HR 
status and biomarkers.  
For enrollment, HER2 (all patients) and HR status (Cohort 2) w ill be based on medical records and 
eligibility will be confirmed by central lab review after enrollment. Any patient found retrospectively 
to be ineligible for either of these parameters will not be evaluable for the primary objective and may 
be replaced.  
11.1.2  Liquid Biopsy

11.2 Analyses  
11.2.1  Tumor HER2 and Hormone Receptor Status  
HER2 and HR status for eligibility  for study enrolment  will be based on medical records.  For all patients, 
eligibility will be confirmed c entral ly from the screening tumor biopsy after enrolment.  
Cohort 1:  HER2 amplification will be confirmed by IHC 3+ or IHC 2+ combined with positive FISH.  
Cohort 2:  ER-positive  status  and low HER2 expression will be  confirmed by IHC 1+ , or IHC 2+ combined 
with negative FISH . 
11.2.2  Exploratory Biomarker Analyses  
Exploratory biomarker and pharmacodynamic analyses will be performed on tumor tissue and blood 
(liquid biopsy) from the screening tumor biopsy and any optional on -study biopsies to assess potential 
correlation s between evidence of activity and expression of HER2, and exploratory biomarkers such 
as HER3 and HER2:HER3, and other candidate biomarkers.  
Identification of new markers correlating with disease activity and activity of treatment is evolving, 
the definitive list of analyses will be determined during the course of the study. The tumor tissue and 
blood samples collected under informed consent may be used to de velop and validate assays and 
allow the generation of statistically meaningful biomarker data. Tumor tissue and blood samples 
remaining after the pre -defined biomarker assessments (e.g., aliquots of tumor cell RNA or DNA) may 
be used for re -testing, develo ping, and va lidating assays related to HER2 -positive breast cancer or the 
prediction of response to MCLA -128, or further assessment of the defined marker panels.  Specific 
patient research consent will be  required for long -term storage of their samples and additional 
exploratory analysis.  
11.2.2.1  Tumor Tissue B iomarkers   
In addition  to HER2 status by IHC and FISH , the following exploratory analyses will be performed if 
sufficient tumor sample is available:  
• HER3 protein, HER2:HER3 dimer ization , and downstream signaling proteins (eg PIK3CA) 
including HER3:pPIK3A binding will be assessed by an appropriate method such as proximity 
ligation ass ay (PLA) . 
• Heregulin mRNA expression  (NRG1)  will be evaluated using in situ  hybridization  or RT-PCR, and 
protein analysis wi ll be performed if an appropriate method (such as IHC) is available.  
If sufficient material is available the following exploratory analyses will be performed:  
• pHER2, pHER3, pAKT and pERK1/2 (members of the MAPK and AKT signaling pathway) will be 
assesse d using a method such as Reverse Phase Protein Array (RPPA ) analysis or IHC and will be 
scored relative to  total HER2, HER3, AKT and ERK respectively. Expression of inhibitors of 
proteins in MAPK and AKT signaling pathway such as PTEN will be assessed by IHC . 
• Mutations in cancer -related genes including those associated with HER2 and HER3 signaling.  
• Heregulin -gene fusions , if required and if a validated assay is available . 
11.2.2.2  Liquid Biopsy  Biomarkers  
Exploratory analys es will include : 
• Fc receptor polymorphism to determine ADCC activity by genotyping on PBMCs  (Day 1 only) . 
• Plasma ctDNA mutation analysis in cancer -related genes including those associated with HE R2 
and HER3 signaling.

14 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
14.1 Sample Size  
Cohort 1 safety run -in: 4 to 6 evaluable patients in the safety run -in will have power to detect an AE 
with a true incidence of 33% is 80 to 90%.  
Cohort 1 efficacy expansion:  40 evaluable patients with observed CBR of > 45% will provide adequate  
precision to exclude 30% (lower limit of 90% CI  > 30%). The threshold for the CBR rate at 24 weeks is 
defined based on the assumption that PFS follows an exponential distribution with a median of 5 
months (clinically relevant) and 3.5 months (not clinically relevant).  
Cohort 2 : 40 e valuable patients with observed CBR of at least 45% will provide enough precision to 
exclude 30% (lower limit of 90% CI  > 30%). The threshold for CBR at 24 weeks is defined based on the 
assumption that PFS follows an exponential distribution with a median of 5 months (clinically relevant) 
and 3.5 months (not clinically relevant).   
The final nu mber of patients will depend on the safety and eff icacy outcomes during the study. U p to 
~130 patients are anticipated, allowing for  a total of 40 patients in each of the three planned 
combination regimens and a ~10% rate of non -evaluable patients.  
14.2 Study E ndpoints  
14.2.1  Definitions  
All efficacy endpoints will be defined and analyzed based on tumor assessment by RECIST 1.1  
(Eisenhauer et al., 2009)  (Appendix  19.4 ). Carcinomatous meningitis diagnosed by cytologic evaluation 
of cerebral spinal fluid will also be d efined as progressive disease. See also Section 9.1. 
• Clinical benefit rate (CBR):  the proportion of patients with a best overall response of CR, PR 
(confirmed a minimum of 4 weeks later) or SD ≥24 weeks, based on tumor assessments up to 
PD, death or the next anti -cancer therapy, whichever occurs earlier.  
• Overall response rate ( ORR ): the proportion of patients with best overall response of CR or PR.  
Objective response is defined as a CR or PR (RECIST 1.1 ) on two consecutive occasions ≥ 4 weeks 
apart.  
• Progression -free survival ( PFS): the time from treatment  start until first documented 
radiographic progression  as determined by the investigator using current RECIST  or death due 
to any cause , whichever occurs  first.  
• PFS ratio ( Cohort 2 only): the ratio of PFS observed on the previous regimen to PFS recorded on 
study treatment.  
• Duration of Response ( DoR ): the time from  the date of initial confirmed  response (CR or PR) 
until the date of progression or death due to  any cause .  
• Overall Survival ( OS): the time from treatment start until death due to any cause.

Treated population:  patients who receive at least one dose of MCLA -128.  
Evaluable for efficacy:  patients who receive at least 2 complete cycles (6 weeks) of treatment and 
have undergone baseline assessment and one on -study tumor assessment, or who discontinue early 
due to disease progression.  
Note : For both cohorts, patients will be enrolled based on  their HER2 status, HR status  (Cohort 2 only) , 
and disease progression on the prior line of therapy , as reported in their medical records. Evaluability 
for the primary endpoint  will be confirmed by central review after enrolment . Any patient found to 
be ineligible retrospectively will not be evaluable for the primary objective  and may  be replaced . Non -
eligible patients are : 
• Cohort 1: patient is not HER2 -positive/amplified  (by central lab) , and/or disease progression 
under the last line of therapy by imaging is not confirmed (by central imaging review) . 
• Cohort 2: is not low HER2 expression (by central lab) , and/or disease progression under the last 
line of therapy by imaging is not confirmed  (by central imaging review) . 
14.4 Statistical Analyses  
Patient disposition and demographics will be analyzed in the treated population, efficacy will be 
analyzed in the eval uable for efficacy population, and safety will be analyzed in the treated population.  
Quantitative variables will be summarized using descriptive statistics. Continuous variables will be 
presented as N, mean and/or median, standard deviation, range. Catego rical variables will be 
presented using frequencies and percentage.  
Results will be summarized by cohort and treatment (i.e., Cohort 1 doublet, Cohort 1 triplet and Cohort

PROPERTY OF MERUS N.V.   CONFIDENTIAL  Page 90 of 127 14.4.1  Analysis of the Primary Efficacy Endpoint  
Criteria for success:  
Cohort 1  (doublet and triplet) : To be e ligible , patients must have progressed on  a maximum of  5 lines 
of HER2 -directed therapy in the metastatic setting; trastuzumab  with pertuzumab and an HER2 
antibody drug conjugate (e.g. T -DM1)  in any sequence and in any setting  must have been previously 
administered. Although the level of antitumor activity is n ot well defined for patients in the  metastatic 
setting progressing on T -DM1, the current assumptions are based on the TH3RESA trial (Krop et al., 
2014 ) in which  patients had a median of 4 previous regimens for advanced disease including both 
trastuzumab -containing and lapatinib -containing therapies. In this trial the T-DM1 arm  showed a 
median PFS of 6.2 months (95% CI , 5.59  - 6.87) while in the control arm (investigator choice, primarily 
trastuzumab -based regimen) PFS was 3.3 months ( 95% CI, 2.89  - 4.14). It is assumed here that a 
clinically relevant median PFS is 5 months, therefore the activity threshold for CBR at 24 weeks is set 
to 45%.  
Cohor t 2: Eligible patients must have progressed on a maximum of 3 lines of endocrine therapy  in the 
metastatic setting and on a CDK4/6 inhibitor. There are no well -established data that can serve as a 
reference for this population. Our assumptions are based on  the phase  3 BELLE -3 study in patients 
who had progressed on an aromatase inhibitor and everolimus which demonstrated median PFS of 
3.9-4.3 months in the overall and PIK3CA -mutated populations treated with buparlisib (a PI3K 
inhibitor) and fulvestrant, and  1.8 months in the fulvestrant -only arm (Angelo et al., 2016) . It is 
assumed here that a clinically relevant median PFS is 5 months, therefore the activity threshold for 
CBR at 24 weeks is set to 45% . 
Observed CBR in both cohorts will be presented with accompanying 90% exact binomial confidence 
interval.  
Patients with only non -measurable disease at baseline will be analyzed for  best overall response and 
CBR, and will be considered as a SD if their response is a ‘Non -CR/Non -PD’. 
 
14.4.2  Analysis o f Other Efficacy Endpoints  
Observed ORR in both cohorts will be presented with accompanying 90% exact binomial confidence 
interval.  Only patients with measurable disease will be included in analyses.   
For PFS, OS and DoR the survival function will be estimated using the Kaplan -Meier product limit 
method; probability estimates and 90% CI will be provided at specified time points; median duration 
and 90% CI will also be provided. DoR will be estimated for  responders only.  
For patients in Cohort 2, the number and proportion of any patients with a PFS ratio ≥ 1.3 (Von Hoff 
et al., 2010)  will be tabulated together with 90% exact CI, along with descripti ve data of the PFS ratio 
for each of these patients . 
For patients with elevated tumor markers (CA15 -3, CEA, and CA27 -29) at baseline, evolution o ver time  
will be evaluated . 
14.4.3  Analysis of the Safety Endpoints  
The safety of MCLA -128 in combination with trastuz umab ± vinorelbine (C ohort 1) or with ET (C ohort 
2) will be assessed by AEs, ECG and LVEF measurements, laboratory test results, and vital signs . 
Adverse events : AEs will be tabulated by the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA®) 
preferred term (PT) and by system organ class (SOC) according to incidence and severity  (based on

PROPERTY OF MERUS N.V.   CONFIDENTIAL  Page 91 of 127 NCI-CTCAE v. 4.03 ). For each patient, the maximum severity of a given AE recorded will be used. AEs 
of special interest (including IRRs) will be tabulated. In addition, AEs leading to discontinuation of study 
treatment and SAEs will be summarized . 
Cardiac safety : The number and percentage of patients with congestive heart failu re (NCI -CTCAE  
v.4.0 3 grades 3, 4, and 5) and asymptomatic LVEF events (NCI -CTCAE grades 1 and 2, as per MUGA or 
ECHO) at any time during the study will be summarized.  
The baseline LVEF value and the maximum absolute decrease (or minimum absolute increase if 
patients’ post -baseline LVEF measures are all above  the baseline value) in LVEF measures from 
baseline will be summarized. LVEF measurements and change in LVEF from baseline will be 
summarized by scheduled visits in graphical and tabular format.  
For eac h ECHO/MUGA evaluation following the initiation of study drug, the number and percentage 
of patients with  dose delay and/or infusion interruption  and ECHO/MUGA repeated will be 
summarized. The change in LVEF at that time point will be summarized using desc riptive statistics.  
Laboratory data : Laboratory toxicities will be defined based on local laboratory normal ranges and 
CTCAE version 4.03. For parameters without CTCAE grade the tables will be based on normal ranges.  
Toxicities for select laboratory abnorm alities will be tabulated according to incidence and severity, 
and shift tables for the worst post -baseline value will be presented. For each patient, the maximum 
severity of a given laboratory toxicity will be used.  
Vital signs:  Maximal changes in vital signs will be summarized in tabular form.   
14.4.4  Analyses of PK, Immunogenicity , Cytokines  and Biomarkers  
PK, immunogenicity, cytokines and biomarkers will be analyzed centrally and results for each will be 
presented separately . 
For pharmacokinetics, s erum conce ntrations of MCLA -128 and trastuzumab will be measured using 
validated bioanalytical methods  at all time points . Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize PK 
parameters. Mean values for C max, C0h, AUC, CL, V ss, tmax and t 1/2 will be calculated  from the individual 
serum concentration versus time profiles of MCLA -128. Mean values for C EOI and C 0h will be calculated 
for trastuzumab.  Additional PK parameters may be calculated as appropriate.  A population PK analysis 
of MCLA -128 may be performed with t he available PK data .

PROPERTY OF MERUS N.V.   CONFIDENTIAL  Page 94 of 127 be maintained in the Investigator Study File  and Trial Master File . Details of the insurance will be made 
available to patients in the ICF.   
15.10  Financial Disclosure  
Before the start of the study, the investigator will disclose to the Sponsor any proprietary or financial 
interests he or she might hold i n the investigational products or the Sponsor company as outlined in 
the financial disclosure form provided by the Sponsor. The investigator agrees to update this 
information in case of significant changes during the study or within one year of its complet ion. The 
investigator also agrees that, where required by law or regulation, the Sponsor may submit this 
financial information to domestic or foreign regulatory authorities in applications for marketing 
authorizations.  
Similar information will be provided by each sub -investigator to whom the investigator delegates 
significant study related responsibilities.  
16  STUDY MONITORING AND AUDITING  
Monitoring and auditing procedures developed or endorsed by the Sponsor will be followed, in order 
to comply with GCP gui delines.  The investigator/institution must provide d irect access to the on -site 
study documentation and medical records.   
16.1 Monitoring and Source Data Verification  
Monitoring will be done by in-person visits by Sponsor  representatives (study clinical research 
associate  [CRA] and medical monitor s) who will check the eCRFs for completeness and clarity, and 
crosscheck them with source documents. In addition to the monitoring visits, frequent 
communications (letter, telepho ne, e -mail and fax), by the study monitors will ensure that the 
investigation is conducted according to protocol design and regulatory requirements.  
A file for each patient must be maintained by the investigator that includes the signed informed 
consent fo rm and all source documentation related to that patient. The Investigator must ensure the 
completeness and the availability of source documents from which the information in the CRF was 
derived.  
At each study monitoring visit, the Investigator or designee will make available all records pertaining 
to the study. To allow sufficient time to assemble the documentation, monitoring visits will be 
confirmed by the site monitor in advance of planned visits.  
Study close -out will be performed by the study monitor up on study closure.  
16.2 On-Site Audits/Inspections  
An external auditor, appointed by the Sponsor or the EC/IRBs, as well as inspectors, appointed by 
domestic and foreign regulatory authorities, may request access to all source documents, CRFs , and 
other study do cumentation for on -site audit s or inspection s. Direct access to these documents must 
be guaranteed by the investigator, who must provide support at all times for these activities. Medical 
records and other study documents may be copied during audit or insp ection provided that patient 
names are obliterated on the copies to ensure confidentiality.  Prior notice will be given to any sites 
selected for auditing.

17.1 Documentation of Study Findings  
All CRF data will be collected using an electronic Case Report Form (eCRF) within a fully validated and 
CFR 21 Part 11 compliant Electro nic Data Capture (EDC) system. All data will be entered into the CRF 
by the designated and appropriately trained site personnel whose name, i nitials, position, and 
signature must be supplied to the Sponsor.  
The investigator, or designated representative, should complete the eCRF pages as soon as possible 
after data are collected, preferably on the same day that a study patient is seen for an e xamination, 
treatment, or any other study procedure and at the latest before the next monitoring visit. An 
explanation should be given for all missing data.  
Data will be source data verified and reviewed by the study site monitor(s) before data cleaning by  
Data Management is performed. A source data location list will be prepared prior to study start and 
will be filed in both the Trial Master File and the Investigator Study File and updated as necessary. All 
queries will be raised and resolved within the ED C system. During entry , data will be checked by 
program ing and once saved into the database further  program ing checks will be performed. During 
the conduct of the study, all system users will have real -time access to the data; the level of access to 
the da ta and study privileges will depend on their role . 
The completed eCRFs must be reviewed and signed by the investigator named in the clinical study 
protocol or by a designated co -investigator.  
All errors detected after the monitoring visit will be queried u sing Data Correction Forms ( DCFs ). The 
Sponsor will answer the question and/or correct errors in the DCF duly signed and dated. Original DCFs 
will be collected by the Sponsor’s study monitor, while a copy will be kept by the investigator and 
recorded in th e Investigator Study File with the corresponding eCRFs.  
A copy of the eCRF will be printed and filed in the Trial Master File . The Sponsor will retain the originals 
of all eCRFs. The investigator will retain a copy of all completed eCRF pages and DCFs.  
17.2 Confidentiality, Use of Study Findings and Publication Policy  
All information concerning the product as well as any matter concerning the operation of the Sponsor, 
such as clinical indications for the drug, its formula, methods of manufacture and other scient ific data 
relating to it, that have been provided by the Sponsor and are unpublished, are confidential and must 
remain the sole property of the Sponsor. The investigator will agree to use the information only for 
the purposes of carrying out this study and  for no other purpose unless prior written permission from 
the Sponsor is obtained.  
Samples and/or data will be processed centrally and the results will be sent electronically to the 
Sponsor or designated CRO. Data that will be processed centrally includes  central imaging review data 
(CT/MRI) and centrally analyzed laboratory data including PK and blood/tumor biomarker samples.  
The Sponsor has full ownership of the original eCRFs completed as part of the study.  
By signing the clinical study protocol, the investigator agrees that the results of the study may be used 
for the purposes of national and international registration, publication, and information for medical 
and pharmaceutical professionals. The authorities will be notified of the investigator's nam e, address,

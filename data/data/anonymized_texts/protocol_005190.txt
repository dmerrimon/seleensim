Number of Study 
Sites  Approximately 20 site s will participate in this study . 
Number of Subjects 
Planned  Approximately 40 subjects with PD and depressi on will be enrolled . 
Test Product, Dose, 
and Administration  Pimavanserin 34  mg (provided as two 17  mg NUPLAZID® tablets) will 
be administered orally once daily (QD).  
Planned Duration 
of Treatment  The duration of an individual subject ’s participation in the study will 
be up to 13 weeks, consisting of a screening period of up to 3 weeks, 
followed by a treatment period of approximately 8 weeks , and a 
2-week safety follow -up. 
Study Design  This will be a multi -center, open -label study to assess the efficacy and 
safety of treatment with 34 mg pimavanserin in subjects with PD and 
depression . Subjects can receive treatment as either a monotherapy or 
adjunctive ly if inadequately controlled with SSRIs/SNRIs  
monotherapy . Each subject will participate in a screening and treatment  
period with regularly scheduled assessments (see Figure  S-1 and 
Table  S–1). 
Screening Period  
Subjects will be assessed for eligibility  and prohibited medications will 
be discontinued. Screening will be up to 3 weeks . 
Treatment Period  
After all screening assessments are completed, eligible subjects will 
return to the clinic for Baseline evaluation. After Baseline  assessments 
are completed,  subjects will be enrolled and receive the first dose of 
pimavanserin. Study medication will be provided to the subjects to take 
home with instructions to take the medication approximately the same 
time each day, and return all used containers and unused s tudy drug as 
scheduled . 
At approximately 2, 4, and 6 weeks after start of dosing of study drug 
subjects will return to the clinic for assessments. Safety measures, 
HAMD -17, C- SSRS, CGI -S, and CGI -I will be evaluated at all visits. 
Subjects will complete t he SCOPA, MMSE, EQ-5D-5L, and UPDRS 
Part III at Baseline and Week 4.  
At the end of the 8 weeks of study drug treatment, subjects will return 
to the clinic for th eir final clinical evaluation. All assessments will be 
completed and unused study drug and containers will be collected.  
Safety Follow -up Period  
Approximately 2 weeks after the last dose of study drug, subjects will 
have a safety follow -up telephone call.

Sample Size 
Calculations  The initial sample size calculation was based on a standard deviation of 
8.0 and a dropout rate of 10%. An interim review of the statistical 
assumptions was conducted after 9 subjects completed the Week 8 
visit, and the sample size was recalculated. The standard deviation in 
HAMD -17 total score change from Baseline to Week 8 was observed to 
be lower, and the dropout rate higher, than the initial assumptions. 
Therefore, the sample size has been recalculated as follows.  
Assuming the standard deviation for the change in HAMD -17 total 
score from Baseline to Week 8 is 6.0 points , 34 evaluable subjects will 
provide 80% power to detect a minimum mean reduction of 3 points 
from Baseline to Week 8 at a significance level of 0.05  using a 2 -sided 
paired t -test.

Clinical Study Protocol  Amendment 2  Date: 8 January  2019 
 
 Confidential and Proprietary Information of ACADIA Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 10 of 68 Adjusting for a potential non -evaluable rate of up to 15%, 
approximately 40 subjects will be enrolled.  
Statistical Methods  The Safety Analysis Set includes all subjects who received at least one 
dose of pimavanserin. The Safety Analysis Set will be used for the 
analysis of all safety endpoints.  
The Full Analysis Set  (FAS)  include s all subjects who received at least 
one dose of pimavanserin and who have both a Baseline value and at 
least one  post-Baseline value for the HAMD -17 total score. The FAS 
will be used for the analysis of all efficacy endpoints.   
Descriptive Statistics  
Cont inuous measurement results will be reported using the number of 
subjects with data values, mean, standard error of the mean, median, 
standard deviation, minimum, and maximum. For each categorical 
outcome, the number and percentage of subjects will be repor ted. 
Efficacy Analyses  
All efficacy endpoints will be summarized by time point using 
descriptive statistics. The primary efficacy endpoint is the change from 
Baseline to Week 8 in depression as measured by the HAMD -17 total 
score.  
The HAMD -17 total score w ill be analyzed using mixed model for 
repeated measures (MMRM). The model will include effects for visit, 
Baseline HAMD -17 total score, and the Baseline HAMD -17 total 
score -by-visit interaction. An unstructured covariance matrix will be 
used to model the w ithin-subject errors and the Kenward -Roger 
approximation will be used to adjust the denominator degrees of 
freedom. The treatment effect for the primary endpoint will be 
estimated as the least -squares mean change from Baseline to Week 8, 
and will be tested  at a significance level of 0.05. In addition, the 
treatment effect will also be estimated at each of the other time points 
(Weeks 2, 4, and 6) using the same MMRM model described above , 
and will be considered secondary  analyses.  
Continuous secondary efficacy endpoints (CGI -I, CGI -S, SCOPA,  and 
EQ-5D-5L) will be analyzed using similar MMRM models  as for the 
primary efficacy endpoint , except that the Baseline value of the 
endpoint being analyzed will be included in the model as a covariate 
instead of th e Baseline HAMD -17 total score. For CGI -I the response 
is the CGI -I score (as opposed to the change from Baseline), and the 
Baseline CGI -S score will be used as the covariate.  
For each of the continuous efficacy endpoints, in addition to MMRM, a 
paired t -test using a last observation carried forward imputation method 
will be performed at each visit.  
For the HAMD -17 responder endpoint s (≥50% reduction from 
Study: ACP -103-048 Final Version: 1.0  
Clinical Study Protocol  Amendment 2  Date: 8 January  2019 
 
 Confidential and Proprietary Information of ACADIA Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 11 of 68 Baseline  in HAMD -17 total score), the p roportion of responders will 
be summarized by visit, including 95% confidence intervals.  
Observed cases (subjects with missing values at a given visit are 
excluded) as well as missing values im puted as non -responders will 
be presented.  
Safety Analyses  
Safety endpoints  will be summarized using descriptive statistics. 
UPDRS Part III and MMSE will be analyzed using similar MMRM 
models as for the primary efficacy endpoint, except that the Baseline 
value of the endpoint being analyzed (either UPDRS Part III or 
MMSE) will be included as a covariate, and in the Baseline scor e-by-
visit interaction term, instead of the HAMD -17 total score.   
Adverse events will be classified into standard terminology using the 
Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). Treatment -
emergent adverse events (TEAEs), TEAEs leading to disco ntinuation, 
TEAEs related to study drug, TEAEs by maximum severity, serious 
adverse events (SAEs), and SAEs related to study drug will be 
summarized.  
Descriptive statistics for ECG, vital signs and weight, C-SSRS, 
MMSE , UPDRS Part III, and clinical laboratory parameters, including 
changes from Baseline, will be tabulated by time point. Additionally, 
categorical analyses will be conducted on the incidence of subjects 
with prolonged QTc intervals and changes in QTc intervals in 
accordance with Internat ional Council for Harmonisation (ICH) 
guidelines.

This document is a research protocol and the described study will be conducted in 
compliance with the protocol  and the International Council for Harmoni sation (ICH)  Good 
Clinical Practice  Guideline (GCP) . All key personnel (all individuals responsible for the 
design and conduct of this study) have c ompleted or will complete human  subject s protection 
training.  
1.1 Background Information  
Parkinson ’s disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized primarily 
by motor deficits ; however , there are also associated behavioral symptoms that are fr equent, 
severe , and disabling . Mood disorders and , in particular , depression occur in approximately 
50% of patients  with PD, can occur at any stage , and increase in duration and severity as the 
disease progresses (Marsh 2013 ). Symptoms of depression in Parkinson ’s disease (DPD ) are 
associated with increased morbidity a nd diminished quality of life. Conversely, improved 
depression is associated with reduced physical disability and imp roved quality of life 
(Menza  et al. 2009 ). The pathophysiology and underlying  mechan isms of DPD  are unknow n. 
Psych ological factors related to the progressive disability in this incurable disease are likel y 
to contribute significantly. In addition, involvement of widespread neurodegeneration and 
dysregulation , particularly in the mesolimbic system, can  also contri bute to depression. 
Regardless o f the cause, the presence of DPD  is a significant concern that requires treatment 
to improve the patient ’s quality of life.  
It is important to note that, in the diagnosis of depression , consideration should be given to 
motor defi cits associated with PD, particularly decreased activity, cognitive dysfunction , and 
somatic complaints , which can complic ate the diagnosis using standard  Diagnostic and 
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders -Fifth Edition ( DSM -5) criteria  (Goodarzi et al. 2016 ). 
To address the unique ch allenges in the diagnosis of DPD , a National Institute of 
Neurological Disorders and Stroke/  National Institute of Mental Health ( NINDS/NIMH ) Task 
Force has developed recommendations for the diagnosis of DPD  (Marsh et al. 2006 ). 
Recommendations for an appropriate diagnosis of DPD , which will be applied in this study, 
include: (1) an inclusive approach to symptom assessm ent to enhance reliability of ratings in 
PD and avoid the need to attribute symptoms to a particular cause; (2)  the inclusion of 
subsyndromal depression in clinical research studies of depression of PD; (3) the 
specification of timing of assessments for PD  patients with motor fluctuations; and (4) the 
use of informants for cognitively impaired patients (Marsh et al. 2006).   
After a diagnosis of DPD  has been made , treatment  options are to be considered. Behavioral 
interventions appear to have some benefit ; however, behavioral therapies typically have at 
Study: ACP -103-048 Final Version: 1.0  
Clinical Study Protocol Amendment 2 Date: 8 January  2019 
 Confidential and Proprietary Information of ACADIA Pharmaceuticals Inc. Page 23 of 68 best modest benefit with a large degree of variability ( Xie et al. 2015 ). In general, traditional 
antidepressants have been found to be safe  and well tolerated and  have efficacy in DPD , 
although th e time course and magnitude of response can differ ( Liu et al. 2013 ; 
Moonen  et al. 2014 ; Rocha et al. 2013 ). As in the general population, despite the availability 
of nume rous pharmacological and psychological treatment options, residual depressive 
symptoms are often evident despite a significant response to an antidepressant medication or 
other intervention ( Marsh 2013 ; Rush et al. 2006 ). Patients with PD may benefit less from 
antidepressant treatment, particularly selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, than do elderly 
patients without PD ( Weintraub et al. 2005 ). Thus, there is a clear need for efficacious and 
well-tolerated agents to treat patients with an inadequate response to standard antidepressant 
therapies, and current research continues to investigate novel molecular and cellular 
mechanisms of augmentation of antidepressant therapies.  
1.2 Investigational Product  
Pimavanserin is an atypical antipsychotic that is present in the investigational product as 
pimavanserin tartrate salt with the chemical name, urea, N-[(4-fluorophenyl)methyl] -N-(1-
methyl -4-piperidinyl) -N’-[[4-(2-methylpropoxy)phenyl]methyl] -,(2R,3R)-2,3-
dihydroxybutanedioate (2:1). In April 2016, pimavanserin was approved in the United States 
(US) for the treatment of hallucinations and delusions associated with Parkinson ’s disease 
psychosis (PDP).  
Pima vanserin is a novel small molecule designed to specifically block serotoninergic 
neurotransmission mediated by the 5 -hydroxytryptamine (5 -HT [serotonin]) 2A (5 -HT 2A) 
receptor. At higher doses , pimavanserin may block 5HT 2C receptors ( Vanover et  al. 2006 ). 
Pimavanserin  shows no appreciable activity at dopaminergic, adrenergic, histaminergic, or 
muscarinic receptors. Activity at these receptors has been implicated in a range of 
dose-limiting side effects associated with existing anti psychotic drugs including cognitive 
dulling ( Saeedi et  al. 2006 ; Mehta et  al. 2004 ; Peretti et  al. 1997 ) and an increased risk of 
mortality in elderly patients with dementia ( Wang et  al. 2005 ). On the basis of its novel 
receptor binding profile, pimavanserin may be effective in treating behavioral problems and 
mood disorders,  and have added benefits with regard to overall tolerability relative to other 
antipsychotic agents.  
In this study, subjects will be asked to take pimavanserin tablets once daily as an oral 
formulation.  
1.3 Previous Clinical Experience  
Pimavanserin is an atypical antipsychotic that is approved for the treatment of hallucinations 
and delusion s associated with PDP. Studies have also been conducted in Alzheimer ’s disease

disease agitation a nd aggression, and major depressive disorde r. The clinical program for 
PDP and the Phase 2 ADP study are reviewed be low as the study popul ation (elderly 
subjects) is most closely aligne d with the intended study population of this protocol. A more 
complete discussion of these studies, as well as other completed and ongoing pimavanserin 
clinical studies, is available in the pimavanserin Investigator’s  Brochure (IB).
1.3.1 Parkinson’s Disease Psychosis Program
The scope of the development program for pimavanserin is the largest ever conducted in 
PDP. At the time of approval, 616 mos tly older, late -stage PDP subjects had been evaluated in 
16 countries over a span of >10 years. Clinically meaningful efficacy was established in 
Study ACP -103-020, a 6 -week, placebo -controlled Phase 3 study. This efficacy was 
supported by data from additi onal short -term Phase 2b/3 studies. In ACP -103-020, 
pimavanserin 34  mg consistently demonstrated statistically significant efficacy across 
multiple and independent endpoints, subject subgroups, and sensitivity analyses. 
Improvements in sleep and daytime wa kefulness were also observed. These clinical benefits 
were achieved without worsening of PD motor symptoms and without a number of other 
safety concerns associated with atypical antipsychotics.
Pimavanserin is considered to be generally safe and well toler ated. Across all clinical studies 
of pimavanserin, the most frequently reported treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs) 
were in the central nervous system (CNS), gastrointestinal, and psychiatric systems. Most 
events were mild to moderate in intensity. T he most common CNS TEAEs included dizziness 
(including postural), headache, and somnolence (drowsiness). Common gastrointestinal 
disturbances included dyspepsia, nausea, constipation, and vomiting. Severe nausea and 
vomiting were dose limiting in a few cas es. Reported psychiatric conditions included 
agitation, insomnia, and confusional state . Refer  to the current IB for the most up -to-date 
Reference Safety Information for pimavanserin.
Clinical and nonclinical safety pharmacology studies of pimavanserin sug gest a potential risk 
for QT prolongation. The magnitude of effect in humans has been assessed in a thorough QT 
study with doses of pimavanserin ranging from 17 to 68  mg. In the Phase 3 PDP program, an 
average prolongation of approximately 5  to 8 ms was ob served  with pimavanserin  34 mg.
The US package insert for pimavanserin has a boxed warning that elderly patients with 
dementia -related psychosis treated with antipsychotic drugs are at an increased risk of death. 
Pimavanserin is not approved in the treatme nt of patients with dementia -related psychosis 
unrelated to the hallucinations and delusions associated wi th PDP .

1.3.2 Alzheimer’s Disease Psychosis  
Evidence from the recently completed Phase 2 study (ACP -103-019) suggests that 
pimavanserin is effective in reducing hallucinations and delusions in subjects with ADP.  
Study ACP -103-019 was a Phase 2, 12 -week randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, 
single -center study to assess the safety and efficacy of pimavanserin 34  mg once daily in 
nursing home subjects with ADP. Eligible subjects were required to have a score of 4 or 
greater on either the hallucinations or delusions scale of the Neuropsychiatri c Inventory -
Nursing Home Version (NPI -NH) or a combined hallucinations and delusions score of 6 or 
greater. The primary efficacy endpoint was change from Baseline to Day 43 in the NPI -NH 
psychosis score (delusions+hallucinations domains).  
A total of 181 su bjects were randomized (n=90 pimavanserin 34  mg and n=91 placebo) with 
178 subjects included in the Full Analysis Set (FAS ) (n=87 pimavanserin and n=91 placebo). 
The mean (standard error [SE]) age of subjects was 85.9 (0.4 8) years. The mean (SE) 
Baseline NPI-NH psychosis score for all FAS subjects was 9.8 (0.39) with comparable mean 
scores in the pimavanserin (9.5) and placebo (10.0) groups. The mean (SE) Mini -mental State 
Examination (MMSE) score for all FAS subjects was 10.1  (0.40).  
Efficacy results for the primary endpoint (NPI -NH psychosis score after 6  weeks of treatment 
[Day 43 ] demonstrated a significant (p=0.0451 ; effect size [Cohen ’s d]= -0.320 ) treatment 
effect for pimavanserin compared with placebo. Prespecified subgroup analyses supported a 
clinically relevant treatment effect in the pimavanserin group, as a larger effect size was 
generally observed in subjects with more severe psychosis. Similarly, the proportion of 
responders (subjects with 30% and 50% reductions from Baseline) was statisticall y 
significantly greater in the pimavanserin group compared to placebo ( Table  1-1). On the 
endpoint of mean change in NPI -NH psychosis score at Week  12, pimavanserin achieved 
improvement to Week 12 but the difference from placebo was not maintained due to an 
observed improvement in the mean score in the placeb o group between Weeks 6 and 12.

With respect to safety, pimavanserin appeared to be well -tolerated with no new safety 
observations in this elderly and frail patient population compared to the pimavanserin PDP 
safety database.  An equal number of post -randomization deaths were reported: 4 deaths in the 
pimavanserin group and 4 in the placebo group.  
There were mor e serious adverse events ( SAEs ) reported in pimavanserin group (16.7%) than 
in the placebo group (11.0%).  A review of the reported SAEs, both in the placebo and 
pimavanserin groups, did not reveal the presence of any common, underlying 
pathophysiologic mec hanism or cause.  However, there were fewer discontinuations due to 
treatment emergent adverse events ( TEAEs) in the pimavanserin group (8.9%) compared 
with the placebo group (12.1%).  
The most common TEAEs in the pimavanserin group were fall (23.3%), urina ry tract 
infection (22.2%), and agitation (21.1%), which have been described as associated with this 
elderly frail patient population. Of these, agitation was reported more often in the 
pimavanserin group than in the placebo group.  
The mean change from Baseline in the QTc interval in subjects treated with pimavanserin 
was 9.4 ms at 12 weeks (Day 85) with no significant outliers reported at Day 85 (>500 ms or 
delta ≥60 ms). One subject in the pimavanserin group and one subject in the placebo group 
had a delt a ≥60 ms at Day 15. Each subject continued in the study.  
Weight data w ere available for about half of the study participants at Day 85. Mean body 
weight and body mass index (BMI) remained relatively unchanged from Baseline to Day 85 
in both treatment group s. Overall, 1 (1.8%) subject in the placebo group and 7 (14.6%) 
subjects in the pimavanserin group experienced weight decrease of ≥7% and 5 (8.8%) 
subjects in the placebo group and 4 (8. 3%) subjects in the pimavanserin group experienced 
weight increase of ≥7%.  
Changes from Baseline in MMSE were similar in placebo and pimavanserin group indicating 
that pimavanserin did not affect cognitive function in these patients. Similarly, treatment with

Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale ( UPDRS ) Part III scores.  
1.4 Study Rationale  
The rationale for the use of pimavanserin as monotherapy  or adjunctive  treatment for DPD  is 
based on the following:  
5-HT 2A serotonin receptors represent important targ ets for depression. A variety of studies 
have shown antidepressant activity from compounds with potent antagonist or inverse agonist 
activity at 5 -HT 2A receptors, and to varying degrees 5 -HT 2C receptors, but low affinity to 
serotonin, norepinephrine, and d opamine transporters , either alone or when co -administered 
with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs; see  Table  1-2). These compounds include 
volinanserin, pruvanserin, ketanserin, ritanserin, mirtazapine, mianserin , and trazodone (see  
Table  1-2). Pimavanserin, with its potent activity as a 5 -HT 2A antagonist/inverse agonist and 
lesser activity as a 5 -HT 2C antagonist/inverse agonist, has a similar receptor profile to many 
compounds with antidepressant activity. Therefore, although there are no pre clinical data on

3 STUDY DESCRIPTION  
3.1 Overview of Study Design  
This will be a multi -center, open -label study to assess the efficacy and safety of treatment 
with 34 mg pimavanserin in subjects with PD and depression . Approximately 20 sites will 
participate in this study. Each subject will participate in a  screening and treatment period with 
regularly scheduled assessments (see  Figure  S-1 and Table  S–1). 
3.2 Screening  Period  (1-21 Days)  
Subjects will be assessed for eligibility and prohibited medications will be discontinued. 
Screening will be up to 3 weeks.  
Investig ators should not discontinue a subject ’s prohibited medication for the purpose of 
enrolling  them into the study. Medications should be discontinued only if it is deemed 
clinically appropriate to do so.  Subjects who are currently taking an SSRI/SNR I and a second 
antidepressant or antidepressant augmentation agent at a sub -therapeutic dose  or for an 
inadequate duration at Screening  can discontinue  the second antidepressant or antidepressant 
augmentation agent before the Baseline visit  if, in the opinion of th e Investigator , the current 
treatment has been inadequate . Current or previous  treatment with an antidepressant is not 
required. The Medical Monitor may also  be consulted.   
3.3 Treatment  Period  (8 Weeks)  
After all screening assessments are completed, eligible subjects will return to the clinic for 
the Baseline evaluation. After Baseline assessments are completed, subjects will be enrolled 
and will begin receiving pimavanserin 34  mg once daily (QD) . Study m edication will be 
provided to the subjects to take home with instructions to take the medication approx imately 
the same time each day. Drug should be dispensed at Baseline and Week 4, with returned 
used container(s) at Week 4 and all containers and unused drugs returned at Week 8.   
At approximately 2, 4 , and 6 weeks after start of dosing of study drug , subjects will return to 
the clinic for assessments. Safety measures, HAMD -17, C-SSRS , CGI-S, and CGI -I will be 
evaluated at all visits. Subjects will complet e the SCOPA , EQ-5D-5L, MMSE, and UPDRS 
Part III  at Baseline and Week 4.  
Study: ACP -103-048 Final Version: 1.0  
Clinical Study Protocol Amendment 2 Date: 8 January  2019 
 Confidential and Proprietary Information of ACADIA Pharmaceuticals Inc. Page 30 of 68 At the end of the 8 weeks of study drug treatment, subjects will return to the clinic for th eir 
final clinical evaluation. All assessments will be completed and unused study drug and 
containers will be collected.  
3.4 Safety Follow -up Period  (Approximately 2 Weeks)  
Approximately 2 weeks after the last dose of study drug, subjects will have a safety follow up 
telephone call visit.

 Confidential and Proprietary Information of ACADIA Pharmaceuticals Inc. Page 34 of 68 4.4 Subject Withdrawal or Termination  
In accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and other applicable regulations, a subject has 
the right to withdraw from the study at any time, and for any reason, without prejudice to his 
or her future medical care.  
Subjects may be discontinued or withdrawn from the study for a number of reasons, 
including, but not limited to, those listed below:  
 Lack of efficacy  
 Adverse event  
 Death  
 Lost to follow -up 
 Non-compliance with study drug  
 Use of prohibited medications  
 Physician decision  
 Pregnancy  
 Protocol  deviation  
 Study terminated by Sponsor  
 Subject withdraws consent  
 Lack of a reliable caregiver/informant  
 Other  
If at any time the C -SSRS results  for a given subject reveal potential suicidality, then the 
Investigator should assess the clinical significance of such results. If a clinically significant 
risk of suicidality is identified for a subject, then the Investigator should discontinue the 
subject and implement appropriate treatment ( Section  6.3.6 ). 
Every reasonable effort should be made to complete the Visit 6 / end of treatment  (EOT) and 
the safety follow -up period if a subject discontinues from the study for any reason.  
If a subject is lost to follow -up, every reasonable effort should be made to phone the subject 
approximately 2 weeks after last known contact with the subject in order to assess the 
subject ’s current status. All phone or other contact with the subject should be documented.  
For subjects who continue to be followed for safety, SAEs should continue to be reported as 
described in Section  7.4.2 . 
Study: ACP -103-048 Final Version: 1.0  
Clinical Study Protocol Amendment 2 Date: 8 January  2019 
 Confidential and Proprietary Information of ACADIA Pharmaceuticals Inc. Page 35 of 68 If a subject is discontinued from the study because of an AE, every reasonable attempt should 
be made to follow the subject until the AE resolves or until the Investigator deems the AE to 
be chronic or stable.  
All SAEs will continue to be followed until such events have resolved or the Investigator 
deems them to be chronic or stable.  
Should a subject request or decide to withdraw, every reasonable effort will be made to 
complete and report ob servations as thoroughly as possible up to the date of withdrawal, 
including the evaluations specified at the E OT visit outlined in  Table  S–1. Unless t he subject 
has withdrawn consent to be contacted for this study, every reasonable effort will be made to 
complete the 2-week safety follow -up telephone call for all subjects who withdraw 
prematurely. All information will be reported on the applicable pages  of the electronic case 
report form (eCRF).  
The Sponsor reserves the right to discontinue the study at any time for any reason. Such 
reasons may include , but not be limited to, the following:  
 Occurrence of AEs unknown to date in respect of their nature, se verity, and duration or 
the unexpected incidence of known AEs  
 Medical or ethical reasons affecting the continued performance of the study  
Regulatory Authorities also have the right to terminate the conduct of the study in their 
region for any reason.  
4.5 Prior  and Concomitant Therapy  
Lifetime antidepressant use and response is to be recorded. All other medications used within  
24 weeks prior to Visit 2 through Visit 7 (telephone visit) or E OT are to be recorded.  
In order to ensure that appropriate concomitant therapy is administered, it is essential that 
subjects be instructed not to take any medication without prior consultation with the 
Investigator (unless the subject is receiving treatment for a medical emergency).  
4.5.1 Permitted, Restricted, and Prohibited Medi cations  
Prohibitions and restrictions for concomitant medications, as specified in Appendix A and 
Appendix B, should be followed between Visit 1 (Screening) and Visit 6/E OT. Medications 
that can p rolong QT interval are prohibited (or restricted if approved by the Medical Monitor 
or appropriate designee) as specified in Appendix A. These appendices do not constitute an 
exhaustive list and any questions regarding prohibited and restricted medications  or the use 
of medications that could interfere with study conduct should be discussed with the Medical 
Monitor or appropriate designee.

Clinical Study Protocol Amendment 2 Date: 8 January  2019 
 Confidential and Proprietary Information of ACADIA Pharmaceuticals Inc. Page 36 of 68 If a subject is on a restricted or prohibited medication at Screening, the medication should be 
adjusted or discontinue d only if it is determined by the Investigator to be clinically 
appropriate (e.g., if the subject's symptoms are not well -controlled or if the subject cannot 
tolerate the current medication).  
The Investigator may prescribe, adjust, or discontinue appropria te medication to treat or 
manage AEs. If a prohibited medication is prescribed to treat an AE, the subject may remain 
in the study if the Sponsor and Investigator (or designee) determine s that it is appropriate for 
the subject to remain in the study.  
All o ther subjects who take a prohibited medication during the study will be discontinued, 
unless the discontinuation presents an unacceptable medical risk. The justification to allow a 
subject to continue in the study will be made by the Sponsor, with medical input from the 
Investigator, and will be documented. If a subject is allowed to remain in the study on 
prohibited medication that is not prescribed to treat an AE, this will be reported as a major 
protocol deviation and not a waiver.

Clinical Study Protocol Amendment 2 Date: 8 January  2019 
 Confidential and Proprietary Information of ACADIA Pharmaceuticals Inc. Page 38 of 68 6.1 Screening Assessments  
6.1.1 Mini -Mental State Examination  
The MMSE is  a brief 30 -point questionnaire that is used to quantitatively assess cognition 
(Folstein et al. 1975 ). The MMSE includes simple questions and problems in a number of 
areas: the time and place of testing, repeating lists of word s, arithmetic, language use and 
comprehension, and copying a drawing. The MMSE is being used in this study to screen for 
cognitive impairment  and it will also be used for safety assessment at other time points . 
6.1.2 Medical History and Demographics  
A complete m edical history will be obtained from each potential subject, includin g details of 
the subject ’s PD and DPD diagnose s and treatment s (including approximate dates of onset) . 
Subjects may be asked to provide pharmacy or medical records to substantiate the med ication 
history ( Section  4.5). 
Demographic information, including date of birth, sex, race, and ethnicity will be recorded as 
well. Any new medical condition reported after the ICF has been signed will be captured as 
an AE. 
6.1.3 Massachusetts General Hospital Antidepressant Treatment Response 
Questionnaire  
The MGH ATRQ ( Fava and Davidson 1996 ; Fava 2003 ) is a clinician -assisted questionnaire 
that is to be completed only for s ubjects who are currently taking an antidepressant  at 
Screening.  The MGH ATRQ examines a patient ’s antidepressant treatment history using  
specific anchor points to define the adequacy of both the dose and duration of each 
antidepressant course, as well as the degree of symptomatic improvement obtained with each 
course. This validated questionnaire allows for the determination of inadequate response  to 
antidepressant therapy Chandler et al. 2010 ). If taking an approved SSRI/SNRI, subjects  
should be exposed to an antidepressant  for at least 4 weeks at a dose appropriate for this 
population.   
6.2 Efficacy Assessments  
6.2.1 Hamilton Depression Scale –17 item  
The Hamilton Depression Scale –17 items ( HAM D-17), is a multiple item questionnaire used 
to provide an indication of  depression,  and as a guide to evaluate recovery ( Hamilton  1960). 
The quest ionnaire is designed for adults to rate the severity of depression by probing  mood,  
feelings of guilt, suicide ideation,  insom nia, agitation or retardation,  anxiety,  weight loss,  and 
somatic symptoms. Each item on the questionnaire is scored on a 3  or 5 point scale, 
depending on the item, and the total score is compared to the corresponding descriptor. A 
Study: ACP -103-048 Final Version: 1.0  
Clinical Study Protocol Amendment 2 Date: 8 January  2019 
 Confidential and Proprietary Information of ACADIA Pharmaceuticals Inc. Page 39 of 68 score of 0 -7 is considere d to be normal. Scores of 14 or higher indicate moderate, severe, or 
very severe depression. Assessment ti me is estimated at 20  minutes.  
6.2.2 Clinical Global Impression –Severity and Improvement Scales  
The CGI -S scale is a clinician -rated, 7 -point scale that is designed to rate the severity of the 
subject ’s depression  at the time of assessment using the Investigator ’s judgment and past 
experience with subjects who have the same disorder ( i.e., depression  in Parkinson ’s disease ) 
(Guy 1976 ). 
The CGI -I is a clinician -rated, 7 -point scale that is designed to rate the improvement in the 
subje ct’s depression  at the time of assessment, relat ive to the symptoms at Baseline .  
6.2.3 Scale of Outcomes in Parkinson’s Disease - Sleep Scale  
The SCOPA Sleep Scale was developed for research in Parkinson disease to evaluate 
nighttime sleep and daytime sleepiness ( Marinus et al. 2003 ). This scale has high internal 
consistency for the nighttime sleep and daytime sleepiness scales (0.88 and 0.91, 
respectively), and test -retest reliabilities (0.94 and 0.89, respectively). Scores on the SCOPA 
Sleep Scale show high correlations between the nighttime sleep scale and the Pi ttsburgh 
Sleep Quality Index (0.83), and between the daytime sleepiness scale and the Epworth 
Sleepiness Scale (0.81). The coefficient of variation of both the nighttime sleep and the 
daytime sleepiness scale is higher than that of the Pittsburgh Sleep Qua lity Index and the 
Epworth Sleepiness Scale, indicating a better ability to detect differences between 
individuals.  
6.2.4 EQ-5D-5L 
The EQ -5D-5L is a standardized instrument used as a measure of health outcome 
(Kind  1996 ). It measures 5 di mensions (mobility, self -care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, 
anxiety/depression) , each of which has 5 potential responses. The responses record 5 levels of 
severity (no problems/slight problems/moderate problems/severe problems/extreme 
problems) withi n a particular EQ -5D dimension. The EQ -5D-5L Proxy Version 1 will be 
used. For this version, a study partner/caregiver (the proxy) is asked to rate subject's 
health -related quality of life in their (the proxy ’s) opinion.  
6.3 Safety Assessments  
6.3.1 Physical Examina tions  
A general physical examination will be conducted. The physical exam procedures will 
include the following organ systems:  
 Head, ears, eyes, nose, and throat  
 Skin

 Respiratory  
 Abdomen  
 Genitourinary (optional)  
 Musculoskeletal  
 Lymph nodes  
6.3.2 Neurological Examination  
A neurological examination (cranial nerves, motor, sensory, reflexes, gait, and coordination) 
will be conducted.  
6.3.3 Vital Signs  
Vital signs will include resting respiration rate, sitting systolic and diastolic blood pressure, 
temperatu re, and pulse rate. The resting blood pressure should be measured after the subject 
has been sitting or supine for ≥3 minutes.  
6.3.4 Height , Weight, and Body Mass Index  
Height will be measured in centimeters.  
Weight will be measured in kilograms.  
Body mass index  (BMI) will be calculat ed using the following formula:  
Weight (kg) / [height (m)]2 
6.3.5 Electrocardiograms  
All 12 -lead ECGs will be complete, standardized recordings. The subject must rest in a 
supine position before the ECG is obtained. ECG tracings (paper or electronic) will be 
reviewed and interpreted by a qualified clinician. ECG tracings and results (ventricular rate, 
PR, QRS, QT, QTcF , and QTcB intervals) will be included and summarized in the subject's 
study records. The ECG will be completed in triplicat e at Visit 1 (Screening) within 
3 minutes, and as a single tracing at all other visits.  
6.3.6 Columbia -Suicide Severity Rating Scale  
The C -SSRS monitors changes in suicidal thinking and behavior over time, in order to 
determine risk ( Posner et al. 2011 ). The following 4 constructs are measured: the severity of 
ideation, the intensity of ideation, behavior, and lethality.  
The C -SSRS will be used to assess s uicidal ideations and behaviors. T he Baseline/Screening 
version will be administere d at Visit 1 ( Screening), and the Since Last Visit version will be

Clinical Study Protocol Amendment 2 Date: 8 January  2019 
 Confidential and Proprietary Information of ACADIA Pharmaceuticals Inc. Page 41 of 68 administered at subsequent visits. The C -SSRS results for each subject should be reviewed by 
the Investigator at each visit. If at any time the C -SSRS results for a given subject reveal 
potential suicidality, then the Investigator should assess the clinical significance of such 
results. If a clinically significant risk of suicidality is identified for a subject, then the 
Investigator should discontinue the subject and implement ap propriate t reatment 
(Section  4.4). 
6.3.7 Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale  
The UPDRS is a comprehensive battery of motor and behavioral indices derived from the 
Columbia Sca le (Goetz et al.  2007 ), providing explicit rating criteria that have undergone 
testing for reliability. Only Part III (motor examination) will be administered.  
The UPDRS assessments should be conducted in the “on” state. This will ensure that noise 
associated with a subject ’s “on/off ” status does not confound interpretation of the motor 
function data.  
6.3.8 Laboratory Evaluations  
The laboratory evaluations will include, but are not be limited to, the following:  
Clinical chemistry tests  
o Sodium (Na), potassium (K), chloride (Cl), phosphorus (P), calcium (Ca), carbon 
dioxide (CO 2), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine (CR), uric acid  
o Alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), gamma -
glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), alkali ne phosphatase (ALP), total bilirubin 
(TBIL), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)  
o HbA1c

6.3.9 Safety Follow -up 
A 2-week safety follow -up telephone contact is to be completed for all subjects. Subjects will 
have the following completed via telephone approximately 2 weeks after the last dose of 
study drug:  
 Asses sment of concomitant medications/treatments  
 Assessment of AEs  
Subjects who discontinue  early  or complete the study should return to standard of care. The 
Sponsor will provide investigative sites with 3 months of after -study assistance to transition 
subject s to standard of care therapy after their participation in the study.  
6.4 Unscheduled Visits  
Unscheduled visits may occur as determined by the Investigator. The following safety 
assessments generally should be recorded at each unscheduled visit: assessment of AEs, 
assessment of concomitant medications/treatments, and measurement of vital signs. The 
Investigator may perform any additional safety evaluations deemed by the Investigator to be 
clinically indicate d. 
7 ADVERSE EVENTS  
7.1 Specification of Safety Parameters  
7.1.1 Definition of Adverse Event  
An AE is defined as “any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in 
humans, whether or not considered drug related ” (US FDA  2012 ).  
An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (e.g., an abnormal laboratory 
finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug, without any 
judgment a bout causality or seriousness. An AE can arise from any use of the drug (e.g., off -
Study: ACP -103-048 Final Version: 1.0  
Clinical Study Protocol Amendment 2 Date: 8 January  2019 
 Confidential and Proprietary Information of ACADIA Pharmaceuticals Inc. Page 44 of 68 label use, use in combination  with another drug) and from any route of administration, 
formulation, or dose, including an overdose.  
A suspected adverse reaction is any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility that the 
drug caused the AE.  
AEs do not include the following:  
 Stable or intermittent chronic conditions (such as myopia requiring eyeglasses) that are 
present prior to Baseline and do not worsen during the study  
 Medical or surgical procedures (e.g., surgery, endoscopy, t ooth extraction, 
transfusion). The condition that lead s to the procedure is an AE if not present at 
Baseline  
 Overdose of concomitant medication without any signs or symptoms unless the subject 
is hospitalized for observation  
 Hospitalization for elective surgery planned prior to study (situation where an 
untow ard medical occurrence has not occurred)  
 Pregnancy will not be considered an AE, but if it occurs, it will be reported on a 
pregnancy form  
Adverse events will be recorded from the time informed consent is obtained through the 
duration of the study.  All AEs  must be either resolved or stable at end of study. If ongoing at 
the end of the study the subject should be referred for appropriate treatment.  
7.1.2 Definition of Serious Adverse Event  
In addition to the severity rating, each AE will be classified by the Inves tigator as “serious ” 
or “not serious. ” The seriousness of an event will be defined according to the applicable 
regulations and generally refers to the outcome of an event. An SAE is one that meets one or 
more of the following:  
 Is fatal  
 Is immediately life threatening  
 Results in disability or permanent damage  
 Requires hospitalization  
 Prolongs existing hospitalization  
 Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect (in an offspring)  
 Is medically significant  
Study: ACP -103-048 Final Version: 1.0  
Clinical Study Protocol Amendment 2 Date: 8 January  2019 
 Confidential and Proprietary Information of ACADIA Pharmaceuticals Inc. Page 45 of 68 Definition of Life Threatening  
A life threatening event plac es the subject at immediate  risk of death  from the event as it 
occurred.  This does not include an AE, which, had it occurred in a more severe form, might 
have caused death.  
Definition of Hospitalization  
Hospitalization is defined by the Sponsor  as a full a dmission to the hospital for diagnosis and 
treatment. This includes prolongation of an existing inpatient hospitalization.  
Examples of visits to a hospital facility that do not meet the serious criteria for hospitalization 
include:  
 Emergency room visits ( that do not result in a full hospital admission)  
 Outpatient surgery  
 Preplanned or elective procedures  
 Protocol procedures  
 Social hospitalization, defined as admission to the hospital as a result of inadequate 
family support or care at the subject ’s primary  residence  
Definition of Disability or Permanent Damage  
Disability is defined as a persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the 
ability to conduct normal life functions.  
Definition of Medically Significant  
Important medical events (medically significant events) that may not result in death, be life 
threatening, or require hospitalization may be considered to be an SAE when, based upon 
appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject or may require medical or 
surgical in tervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of 
such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic 
bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias, or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization or 
develo pment of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
An SAE may also include any other event that the Investigator or Medical Monitor judges to 
be serious or that suggests a significant hazard, contraindication, side effect, or precaution.  
Study: ACP -103-048 Final Version: 1.0  
Clinical Study Protocol Amendment 2 Date: 8 January  2019 
 Confidential and Proprietary Information of ACADIA Pharmaceuticals Inc. Page 46 of 68 7.2 Classification of an Adverse Event  
7.2.1 Severity of Event  
The severity of each AE will be graded on a 3 -point scale and reported in detail as indicated 
on the eCRF:  
Mild:  awareness of sign or symptom but easily tolerated, causing minimal 
discomfort, and not interfering with normal everyday activities  
Moderate:  sufficiently discomforting to interfere with normal everyday activities  
Severe:  incapacitating and/or preventing n ormal everyday activities  
7.2.2 Relationship to Study Drug  
The causality of each AE should be assessed and classified by the Investigator as “related ” or 
“not related. ” An event is considered related if there is a reasonable possibility that the event 
may have b een caused by the study drug under investigation (i.e., there are facts, evidence, or 
arguments to suggest possible causation).  
Consider the following when assessing causality:  
 Temporal associations between the agent and the event  
 Response to cessation (de -challenge) or re -challenge  
 Compatibility with known class effect  
 Known effects of concomitant medications  
 Pre-existing risk factors  
 A plausible mechanism  
 Concurrent illnesses  
7.2.2.1  Duration  
The start and stop dates for AEs will be recorded using the following c riteria:  
 Start:  Date of the first episode of the AE or date of significant sustained worsening in 
severity  
 Stop:  Date when AE either ceased permanently or changed in severity  
7.2.2.2  Frequency  
The frequency of the AE should be indicated according to the following definitions:  
 Single:  Experienced once, without recurrence  
Study: ACP -103-048 Final Version: 1.0  
Clinical Study Protocol Amendment 2 Date: 8 January  2019 
 Confidential and Proprietary Information of ACADIA Pharmaceuticals Inc. Page 47 of 68  Recurrent:  More than one discrete episode with the same severity  
7.2.2.3  Action Taken with Study Drug  
 Dose not changed:  No change in study drug  
 Drug interrupted:  Study drug temporarily stopped  
 Drug withdrawn:  Study drug discontinued permanently  
7.2.2.4  Therapy  
 None:  No new treatment instituted  
 Medication:  New treatment initiated as a direct result of AE  
 Other:  Other action required  
7.2.2.5  Outcome  
 Recovered/resolved:  Recovered or resolved  
 Recovered/resolved with seq uelae:  Recovered or resolved with sequelae  
 Not recovered/not resolved:  Not recovered or not resolved  
 Fatal:  Death related to AE  
 Unknown:  Unknown  
7.2.2.6  Seriousness  
 Not serious  
 Serious  
7.2.3 Definition of Unexpectedness  
An AE, the nature or severity of which is not cons istent with the information provided in the 
Reference Safety Information section of the current pimavanserin I B. 
7.3 Time Period and Frequency for Event Assessment and Follow -up 
In the event that a subject is withdrawn from the study because of an AE, the subj ect should 
be followed and treated by the Investigator until the AE has resolved, stabilized, or a new 
chronic baseline has been established.  
7.4 Reporting Procedures  
7.4.1 Adverse Event Reporting  
The Investigator must record all observed AEs and all reported AEs. A t each visit, the 
Investigator should ask the subject a nonspecific question (e.g., “Have you noticed anything 
Study: ACP -103-048 Final Version: 1.0  
Clinical Study Protocol Amendment 2 Date: 8 January  2019 
 Confidential and Proprietary Information of ACADIA Pharmaceuticals Inc. Page 48 of 68 different since your last visit? ”) to assess whether any AEs have been experienced since the 
last report or visit.  
Note that any use of medicatio n (and specifically any newly prescribed medication) during 
the course of a study may indicate the occurrence of an AE that may need to be recorded on 
both the AE and the concomitant medication page.  
All AEs will be coded by Data Management using MedDRA.  
All AEs, serious and not serious, will be recorded on the AE eCRF page using appropriate 
medical terminology. Severity and relationship to study drug will be assessed by the 
Investigator . 
When possible, clinical AEs should be described by diagn osis and not by symptoms 
(e.g.,  “cold” or “seasonal allergies ” instead of “runny nose ”). 
All AEs, whether or not related to the study drug , must be fully and completely documented 
on the AE eCRF and in the subject ’s notes.  
7.4.2 Serious Adverse Event Reporting  
The reporting of SAEs by the Sponsor  to the Regulatory Authorities is a regulatory 
requirement. Each Regulatory Authority has established a timetable for reporting SAEs based 
upon established criteria.  
Serious AEs must be reported within 24 hours of discov ery to the Sponsor  or its designee ; use 
the appropriate form for  initial and/or follow -up reporting.  
At a minimum, events identified by the Sponsor  to require expedited reporting as serious, 
unexpected, and related to study drug must be brought to the attention of th e responsible 
Institutional Review Board/Ethics Committee ( IRB/EC ). These wil l be provided by the 
Sponsor  after their assessment. For European Union member states, the Sponsor  or its 
designee will provide reports of suspected unexpected serious adverse rea ctions directly to 
the ECs, as required by local legislation. In all other countries, it is the Investigator ’s 
responsibility to provide these expedited reports to the responsible IRB/EC. It is also the 
Investigator ’s responsibility to notify the responsib le IRB/EC regarding any new and 
significant safety information.  
For this study, sites will complete the paper SAE, Pregnancy (Section  7.4.3 ) and/or  Overdose  
(Section  7.4.4 ) form (for initial and/or follow -up information) including available supporting 
documentation relevant to the event and fax or email (within 24 hours of discovery) to the 
contact information provided on the SAE, Pregnancy, and Overdose forms.  
Study: ACP -103-048 Final Version: 1.0  
Clinical Study Protocol Amendment 2 Date: 8 January  2019 
 Confidential and Proprietary Information of ACADIA Pharmaceuticals Inc. Page 49 of 68 Subjects will be followed until Visit 6/Safety Follow -up for any SAEs and/or other reportable 
information or until such events have resolved or the Investigator, in conjunction with the 
Sponsor , deems the m to be chronic or stable.  
In the event of any SAE (other than death), the study subject will be instructed to contact the 
Investigator (or designee) using the telephone number provided in the ICF. All subjects 
experiencing an SAE will be seen by the Inves tigator or designee as soon as is feasible 
following the report of the SAE.  
Serious AEs occurring after the study Follow -up Period should be reported if in the judgment 
of the Investigator there is “a reasonable possibility ” that the event may have been ca used by 
the product.  
SAEs should also be reported to the IRB/EC according to local regulations.  
7.4.3 Reporting of  Pregnancy  
Any female subject who becomes pregnant during the study (with or without AEs) must be 
withdrawn from the study and the pregnancy must be  reported on the pregnancy form  within 
24 hours of discovery to the Sponsor  or its designee . Any female subject who becomes 
pregnant during the study will be followed through the first well -baby visit.  
Any AEs that are the consequence of pregnancy and whic h meet the criteria for serious 
should also be reported via the SAE form.  
7.4.4 Reporting of Overdose  
An overdose is a deliberate or inadvertent administration of a treatment at a dose higher than 
the maximum recommended dose per protocol. It must be reported to  the Sponsor or 
designee on the Overdose Form within 24 hour s of discovery.  
8 CLINICAL MONITORING  
Routine monitoring of study sites is described in Section  11. 
Clinical site monitoring is conducted to ensure that the rights and well -being of human 
subjects are protected, that the reported study data are accurate, complete, and verifiable, and 
that the conduct of the study is in compliance with the currently approved protocol and 
amendment(s) as applicable, with GCP, and with applicable regulatory requirements. Details 
of the study site monitoring process are described in a separate clinical monitori ng plan 
document.

9.1 Statistical and Analytical Plans  
Statistical methods will be documented in detail in a statistical analysis plan (SAP) to be 
approved by the Sponsor prior to database lock . 
9.2 Description of Statistical  Methods  
For continuous variables, the following summary statistics will be provided: number of 
subjects, mean, standard error of the mean, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, and 
median. For categorical variables, summaries will include the number and p ercentage of 
subjects in each category, using the number of subjects with non -missing values as the 
denominator for the percentages (unless otherwise specified).  
 Unless otherwise specified, all reported p -values will be 2-sided  hypothesis tests 
performed at the significance level of 5%, and all confidence intervals (CIs) will be 
2-sided 95% CIs . All analyses will be performed using SAS® software, Version 9.4 
(SAS  Institute, Inc., Cary, North Carolina) or higher. Validation and q uality control of 
the tables, listings, and figures containing the results of the statistical analyses will 
follow appropriate standard operating procedures.  
9.3 Handling of Dropouts and Missing Data  
Handling of missing values will be described in detail in th e SAP.  
9.4 Sample Size Determination  
The initial sample size calculation was based on a standard deviation of 8.0 and a dropout 
rate of 10%. An interim review of the statistical assumptions was conducted a fter 9 subjects 
completed the Week 8 visit,  and the sample size was recalculated. T he standard deviation  in 
HAMD -17 total score change from Baseline to Week 8  was observed to be lower , and the 
dropout rate higher , than the initial  assumptions. Therefore, the sample size has been 
recalculated as follows.  
Assuming the standard deviation for the change in HAMD -17 total score from Baseline to 
Week 8 is 6.0 points, 34 evaluable subjects will provide 80% power to detect a minimum 
mean reduction of 3 points from Baseline to Week 8 at a signi ficance level of 0.05 us ing a 
2-sided paired t -test. 
Adjusting for a potential non -evaluable rate of up to 15%, approximately 40 subjects will be 
enrolled.

This is an open -label, single arm study; therefore, subjects, site staff, and the Sponsor will be 
unblinded to th e treatment administered.  
9.6 Additional Subgroup Analyses  
Selected analyses will be performed in subgroups defined by treatment regimen:  
 pimavanserin monotherapy  
 pimavanserin adjunctive therapy  
Additional subgroup analyses may be specified in the statistical analysis plan.  
9.7 Study Subjects  
9.7.1 Analysis Sets  
The Safety Analysis S et includes all subjects who received at least one dose of pimavanserin . 
The Safety Analysis S et will be used for analyses of all safety endpoints.  
The FAS includes all subjects who received at least one dose of pimavanserin and who have 
both a Baseline value and at least one post -Baseline value for the HAMD -17 total score. The 
FAS will be used for the analysis of all efficacy endpoints.  
9.7.2 Subject Accou ntability and Subject Disposition   
Study enrollment will be summarized. The number and percentage of subjects enrolled and 
treated in the study will be presented together with the number and percentage in each 
analysis set, and the number and percentage of  subjects who completed the study and those 
who withdrew early. A summary of reasons for early withdrawal from the study will be 
provided.  
A listing of the reasons for exclusions from the analysis sets will be provided.  
9.7.3 Demographics and Baseline Characteristics  
Demographics and baseline characteristics will be summarized using descriptive statistics 
and the corresponding listings will be provided.  
9.8 Efficacy Analyses  
All efficacy endpoints will be summarized by time point using descriptive statistic s. Details 
regarding the scoring for each instrument will be provided in the SAP.  
Continuous measurement results will be reported using the number of subjects with data 
values, mean, standard error of the mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, and 
maxi mum. For each categorical outcome, the number and percentage of subjects will be 
reported.

Clinical Study Protocol Amendment 2 Date: 8 January  2019 
 Confidential and Proprietary Information of ACADIA Pharmaceuticals Inc. Page 52 of 68 9.8.1 Primary Efficacy Analyses  
The primary efficacy endpoint is the change from Baseline to Week 8 in the HAMD -17 total 
score. The primary analysis will be based on the F AS. 
The null and alternative hypotheses for the primary endpoint are as follows:  
 The null hypothesis  is that the mean change from Baseline to Week 8 in HAMD -17 
total score  is equal to 0 .  
 The alternative hypothesis  is that the mean change from Baseline to Week 8 in 
HAMD -17 total score  is not equal to 0 .  
The HAMD -17 total score will be analyzed using the mixed model repeated measures 
(MMRM). The dependent variable will be the change from Baseline in the HAMD -17 total 
score, and the independent variables wil l include the following: Baseline HAMD -17 total 
score, visit (Weeks 2, 4, 6, and 8), and Baseline HAMD -17 total score -by-visit interaction. 
An unstructured covariance matrix will be used to model the within -subject errors, and the 
Kenward -Roger approximati on will be used to adjust the denominator degrees of freedom.  
The treatment effect for the primary endpoint will be estimated as the least -squares mean 
change from Baseline to Week 8, and will be tested at a significance level of 0.05. In 
addition, the tre atment effect will also be estimated at each of the other time points (Weeks 2, 
4, and 6 ) using the same MMRM, and will be considered secondary endpoints.  
In addition, a paired t -test using a last observation carried forward (LOCF) imputation 
method will b e performed at each post -baseline visit.  
9.8.2 Secondary Efficacy Analyses  
Secondary efficacy endpoints will include the following:  
 CGI-Improvement (CGI -I) 
 Change from Baseline in CGI -Severity (CGI -S) 
 Change from Baseline in Scale of Outcomes in PD -Sleep Scale ( SCOPA) night time 
sleep score  
 Change from Baseline in SCOPA day time sleepiness score  
 Proportion of responders (defined  as ≥50% reduction from Baseline in HAMD -17 total 
score)  
 Change from Baseline in EuroQOL -5 dimensions -5 levels (EQ -5D-5L) 
All continuous secondary efficacy endpoints (CGI -I, CGI -S, SCOPA, and E Q-5D-5L) will be 
summarized by time point using descriptive statistics. Continuous secondary efficacy 
Study: ACP -103-048 Final Version: 1.0  
Clinical Study Protocol Amendment 2 Date: 8 January  2019 
 Confidential and Proprietary Information of ACADIA Pharmaceuticals Inc. Page 53 of 68 endpoints will be analyzed using similar MMRM models as for the primary efficacy 
endpoint, except that the Baseline value of the endpoint being analyzed will be included as a 
covariate, and in the Baseline score -by-visit interaction term, instead of the HAMD -17 total 
score.  
In the case of CGI -I, it will be analyzed using an MMRM model with CGI -I score  (rather 
than the change from Baseline) as the dependent variable, and with independent variables of 
Baseline CGI -S score, visit, and Baseline CGI -S score -by-visit interaction.  
For the HAMD -17 responder endpoint  (≥50% reduction from Baseline in HAMD -17 tot al 
score), the proportion of responders will be summarized by visit, including 95% confidence 
intervals . Observed cases (subjects with missing values at a given visit are excluded) as well 
as missing values imputed as non -responders will be presented.  
For the EQ -5D-5L endpoint, the dependent variable will be the score from the EQ visual 
analogue scale.  Additionally, for each EQ -5D dimension, the number and percentage of

10 STUDY MANAGEMENT AND DATA COLLECTION  
10.1 Data Collection and Management Responsibilities  
All documents required for the con duct of the study as specified in the ICH GCP guidelines 
will be maintained by the Investigator in an orderly manner and made available for 
monitoring and/or auditing by the Sponsor and regulatory agencies.  
The Investigator and institution must permit authorized representatives of the Sponsor or 
designees (including monitors and auditors), Regulatory Agencies (including inspectors), and 
the IRB/EC direct access to source documents (such as original medical records). Direct 
access includes permission to examine, analyze, verify, and reproduce any records and 
reports that are needed for the evaluation of the study. The Investigator must ensure the 
reliability and availability of source documents from which the information on the eCRF was 
derived.  
10.2 Source Do cuments  
All study specific information obtained at each study visit must be recorded in the subject ’s 
record (source documentation), and then entered into a validated electronic data capture 
(EDC) database by trained site personnel. The source documentatio n may consist of source 
notes captured by site personnel as well as laboratory reports, ECG reports, and electronic 
source data.  
10.3 Case Report Forms  
Subject data required by this protocol are to be recorded in an EDC  system on eCRFs. The 
Investigator and his  or her site personnel will be responsible for completing the eCRFs. The 
Investigator is responsible for the accuracy and reliability of all the information recorded on 
the eCRFs. All information requested on the eCRFs needs to be supplied, including subje ct 
identification data, visit date(s), assessment values, etc., and any omission or discrepancy will 
require explanation. All information on eCRFs must be traceable to source documentation at 
the site.  
10.4 Confidentiality  
The Investigator must ensure that each  subject ’s anonymity is maintained. On the eCRFs or 
other documents submitted to the Sponsor or designees, subjects must be identified by a 
Study: ACP -103-048 Final Version: 1.0  
Clinical Study Protocol Amendment 2 Date: 8 January  2019 
 Confidential and Proprietary Information of ACADIA Pharmaceuticals Inc. Page 56 of 68 Subject Identification Number only. Documents that are not for submission to the Sponsor or 
designees (e.g., signed ICFs) should be kept in strict confidence by the Investigator in 
compliance with Federal regulations or other applicable laws or ICH Guidance on GCP.  
10.5 Study Records Retention  
Investigators are required to maintain all essential study documentation as per IC H GCP 
guidelines. This includes, but is not limited to, copies of signed, dated and completed eCRFs, 
documentation of eCRF corrections, signed ICFs, audio recordings, subject -related source 
documentation, and adequate records for the receipt and dispositio n of all study drug. 
Investigators should maintain all essential study documentat ion, for a period of at least 
2 years following the last approval of marketing application in an ICH region (US, Europe, 
and Japan), or until at least 2 years after the drug i nvestigational program is discontinued, 
unless a longer period is required by applicable law or regulation. Only the Sponsor can 
notify an Investigator or vendor when any records may be discarded. Investigators should 
contact the Sponsor before destroying any files.  
10.6 Protocol Exceptions and Deviations  
No prospective entry criteria protocol deviations are allowed; all subjects must meet all 
eligibility criteria in order to participate in the study.  
Protocol waivers for eligibility and use of prohibited medica tion during the study 
(Section  4.5.1 ) will not be granted by the Sponsor under any circumstances. If, during the 
course of a subject ’s participation in the trial it  is discovered that the subject did not meet all 
eligibility criteria, he or she will be discontinued, unless the discontinuation presents an 
unacceptable medical risk. The justification to allow the subject to continue in the trial will 
be made by the Spo nsor, with medical input from the Investigator, and will be documented. If 
allowed to remain in the trial, this will be reported as a major protocol deviation and not a 
waiver. All follow -up safety assessments must be completed and documented as outline d in 
the protocol (Section  6.3.9 ). The  Investigator must report any protocol deviation to the 
Sponsor and, if required, to the IRB/EC in accordance with local regulations, within 
reasonable time.  
10.7 Protocol Amendments  
Changes to the protocol may be made only by the Sponsor (with or without consultation with 
the Investigator). All protocol modifications must be submitted to the site IRB/EC in 
accordance with local requirements and, if required, to Regulatory Agencies, as either an 
amendment or a notification. Approval for amendments must be awaited before any changes 
can be implemented, except for changes necessary to eliminate an immediate hazard to trial

approval is required for notifications.  
11 STUDY MONITORING, AUDITING, AND INSP ECTING  
11.1 Quality Control and Quality Assurance  
The Sponsor or designee and Regulatory Agency inspectors are responsible for contacting 
and visiting the Investi gator for the purpose of inspecting the facilities and, upon request, 
inspecting the various records of the trial (e.g., eCRFs and other pertinent data) provided that 
subject confidentiality is respected.  
The Sponsor ’s or designee ’s monitor is responsible for inspecting the eCRFs at regular 
intervals throughout the study to verify adherence to the protocol; completeness, accuracy, 
and consistency of the data; and adherence to local regulations on the conduct of clinical 
research. The monitor should have acc ess to subject medical records and other study -related 
records needed to verify the entries on the eCRFs.  
The Investigator agrees to cooperate with the monitor to ensure that any problems detected in 
the course of these monitoring visits are resolved.  
In accordance with ICH Guidance on GCP and the Sponsor ’s audit plans, a certain 
percentage of sites participating in this study will be audited. These audits may include a 
review of site facilities (e.g., pharmacy, drug storage areas, and laboratories) and rev iew of 
study -related records may occur in order to evaluate the trial conduct and compliance with 
the protocol, ICH Guidance on GCP, and applicable regulatory requirements.  
The Sponsor ’s or designee ’s representatives, Regulatory Agency inspectors, and IRB/ EC 
representatives who obtain direct access to source documents should also respect subject 
confidentiality, taking all reasonable precautions in accordance with applicable regulatory 
requirements to maintain the confidentiality of subjects ’ identities.  
12 ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS

 Confidential and Proprietary Information of ACADIA Pharmaceuticals Inc. Page 67 of 68 Appendix B  Prohibited and Restricted Concomitant Medications: Inhibitors and 
Inducers of Cytochrome P450 Enzyme 3A4  
The information presented here is intended to provide guidance and does not constitute an 
exhaustive list of strong CYP 3A4 enzyme (CYP3A4) inhibitors and inducers . Any questions 
should be discussed with the Medical Monitor or appropriate designee.  
Subjects who take prohibited con comitant medications during the study will be discontinued, 
unless the discontinuation presents an unacceptable medical risk . The justification to allow 
the subject to continue in the study will be made by the Sponsor/Medical Monitor with 
medical input fro m the Investigator, and will be documented . If allowed to remain in the 
study, this will be reported as a major protoc ol deviation and not a waiver.  
Inhibitors of CYP3A4 are to be stopped at least 7 days or 5 half -lives  prior to study drug 
administration, whichever is longer. Inducers of CYP3A4 are to be stopped 30 days or 
5 half-lives prior to study drug administration, whichever is longer. Moderate inhibitors and 
inducers of CYP3A4 may be allowed but should be used with caution. The metabolism of 
pimavans erin is affected by strong CYP3A4 inhibitors, resulting in an increase in maximum 
plasma concentration (C max) and area under the plasma concentration -time curve (AUC) of 
approximately 3 -fold.

a The effect of grapefruit juice varies widely among brands and is concentration -, dose -, and preparation -
dependent . Studies have shown that it can be classified as a “strong CYP3A inhibitor ” when a certain 
preparation was used (e.g., high dose, double strength) or as a “moderate CYP3A inhibitor ” when another 
preparation was used (e.g., low dose, single strength) . (FDA Drug Development and Drug Interactions

2Rationale for Amendment 04
This document describes changes in reference to the protocol incorporating Amendment 04. 
The primary reason for this amendment is to employ overall survival (OS) as the primary 
endpoint of the study. OS is a clearly defined endpoint that is commonly used in studies with patients with higher-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (HR MDS) or chronic myelomonocytic 
leukemia (CMML) and low-blast acute myeloge nous leukemia (AML). Event-free survival 
(EFS), the previous primary endpoint of the study, is now a secondary endpoint. These
changes affect the objectives and endpoints of the study. The protocol was also amended to clarify definitions of response, duration of th e study, and concomitant medication therapy, 
and to update the metabolism profile of pevonedistat and the statistical analysis plan for the 
study.
Throughout the protocol where text previously read “HR MDS or CMML patients” and 
“low-blast AML patients,” text now reads “patients with HR MDS or CMML” and “patients 
with low-blast AML.”
Minor grammatical, editorial, formatting, and administrative changes not affecting the 
conduct of the study are included for clarification and administrative purposes only. 
For specific descriptions of text changes, the rationale for each change, and where the 
changes are located, see Section 15.13.

4PROTOCOL SUMMARY
Study Title: A Phase 2, Randomized, Controlled, Open -Label, Clinical Study of the Efficacy and 
Safety of Pevonedistat Plus Azacitidine Versus Single -Agent Azaci tidine in Patients With Higher -
Risk Myelodysplastic Syndromes, Chronic Myelomonocytic Leukemia, and Low -Blast Acute 
Myelogenous Leukemia
Number of Patients: It is expected that approximately 117 patients will be enrolled in this study.
Study Objectives
Primary
To determine in patients with higher -risk myelodysplastic syndrome (HR MDS) or chronic 
myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) and low -blast acute myelogenous leukemia (AML)
whether the combination of pevonedistat and azacitidine improves overall survival ( OS)when 
compared with single -agent azacitidine.
Secondary
To determine in patients with HR MDS or CMML and low -blast AML whet her the 
combination of pevonedistat and azacitidine improves event -free survival (EFS) when 
compared with single -agent azacitidine; for patients with HR MDS or CMML, an event is 
defined as death or transformation to AML; for patients with low -blast AML, an event is 
defined as death.
To determine in patients with HR MDS or CMML and low -blast AML whether the 
combination of pevonedistat and azacitidine improves 6 -month and 1 -year survival rates 
when compared with single -agent azacitidine.
To determine in patients with HR MDS or CMML whether the combination of pevonedistat 
and azacitidine delays time to AML transf ormation when compared with single -agent 
azacitidine.
To determine in patients with HR MDS or CMML and low -blast AML whether the 
combination of pevonedistat and azacitidine, when compared with single -agent azacitidine, 
improves the rate of complete remissi on (CR) (composite CR [CR+ CRi ]in patients with 
low-blast AML), CR plus partial remission (composite CR + PR for patients with low -blast 
AML), overall response, and/or CR (not including CRi) in low -blast AML. Overall response 
in HR MDS or CMML is defined as CR + PR + hematologic improvement (HI); overall 
response in low -blast AML is defined as CR + CRi + PR.
To determine in patients with HR MDS or CMML and low -blast AML whether the 
combination of pevonedistat and azacitidine, when compared with single -agent azacitidine, 
improves the rate of CR (composite CR [CR + C Ri] in patients with low -blast AML), CR + 
PR (composite CR + PR in patients with low -blast AML), the overall response rate (ORR), as 
well as CR (not including CRi) in low -blast AML by Cycle 4.
Todeter mine in patients with HR MDS or CMML and low -blast AML whether the 
combination of pevonedistat and azacitidine, when compared with single -agent azacitidine, 
improves duration of CR (composite CR [CR + C Ri] in patients with low -blast AML), CR + 
PR (co mpos ite CR + PR in patients with low -blast AML), overall response, and/or CR (not 
including CRi) in patients with low -blast AML.

5combination of pevonedistat and azacitidine improves time to first CR (CR for HR 
MDS/CMML and low-blast AML; CR + CRi [composite CR] for low-blast AML), or PR 
when compared with single-agent azacitidine.
!To determine in patients with HR MDS or CMML and low-blast AML whether the combination of pevonedistat and azacitidine delays time to subsequent therapy when 
compared with single-agent azacitidine. Subsequent therapy is defined as agent(s) with antileukemic/anti–myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) activity (eg, cytarabine, anthracyclines, 
purine analogues, and hypomethylating agents other than azacitidine). Patients who 
discontinue study treatment to receive single-agent azacitidine off study would not be counted as receiving subsequent therapy.
!To determine in patients with HR MDS or CMML and low-blast AML whether the combination of pevonedistat and azacitidine improves rate of transfusion independence when 
compared with single-agent azacitidine. Red blood cell (RBC) or platelet transfusion 
independence requires that the patient receive no RBC or platelet transfusions, respectively, for a period of at least 8 weeks.
!To determine in patients with HR MDS or CMML and low-blast AML whether the combination of pevonedistat and azacitidine reduces the percent of patients who have at least 
one inpatient hospital admission(s) related to HR MDS, CMML, or low-blast AML when 
compared with single-agent azacitidine.
!To determine in patients with HR MDS or CMML and low-blast AML whether the combination of pevonedistat and azacitidine delays time to disease progression (progressive disease; PD), relapse, or death when compared with single-agent azacitidine. 
!To evaluate in patients with HR MDS or CMML and low-blast AML, the safety of the combination of pevonedistat and azacitidine when compared with single-agent azacitidine.
!To collect in patients with HR MDS or CMML and low-blast AML plasma concentration-time data for pevonedistat to contribute to future population pharmacokinetic 
(PK) analyses of pevonedistat.

Clinical Study Protocol Pevonedistat-2001 Amendment 04, EudraCT: 2015-000221-37
6Overview of Study Design: This study is a multicenter, global, randomized, controlled, open-label, 
phase 2 clinical study of the combination of pevonedistat and azacitidine versus single-agent 
azacitidine administered in patients with HR MDS or CMML or low-blast AML who have not previously received a hypomethylating agent.
Once enrolled, patients will be randomized at a 1:1 ratio to receive study drug (either single-agent 
azacitidine or the combination of pevonedistat and azacitidine) in 28-day treatment cycles. All 
patients will be stratified into 4 categories: low-blast AML, Revised International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS-R) risk group of very high, high, or intermediate for MDS/CMML [2]. All patients 
will receive azacitidine (75 mg/m
2[intravenous or subcutaneous]) on Days 1 through 5, Day 8, and 
Day 9. Patients randomized to the combination arm will also receive pevonedistat (20 mg/m2via 
60-minute infusion) on Days 1, 3, and 5 of each cycle. Dose modifications may be allowed.
Patients, including those who achieve a CR, may receive study treatment until they experience 
unacceptable toxicity, relapse, transformation to AML, or progressive disease as defined in this 
study.
Patients with HR MDS or CMML may be allowed to continue study treatment (either treatment arm) 
if they meet the criteria for progressive disease based only on bone marrow blast count (without 
AML transformation) if, in the clinical judgment of the investigator, the patient is still receiving clinical benefit from this treatment and the continuation is endorsed by the sponsor’s project 
clinician (or designee). Patients with low-blast AML in this study may also be allowed to continue 
study treatment (either treatment arm), even if they meet the criteria for progressive disease based only on bone marrow blast counts, if, in the clinical judgment of the investigator, the patient is still receiving clinical benefit from this treatment, and the continuation is endorsed by the sponsor’s 
project clinician (or designee). Patients who meet the criteria for PD and continue on study under 
these conditions must be reconsented before continuing study treatment. Patients may choose to discontinue at any time. 
Patients will attend the End-of-Treatment (EOT) visit 30 days (+10 days) after the last dose of study 
drug or before the start of subsequent antineoplastic therapy if that occurs sooner. Patients will enter 
EFS follow-up (for patients with HR MDS/CMML) or response follow-up (for patients with 
low-blast AML), with study visits every 3 months, to include physical exam, clinical blood tests, 
HRQOL assessments, hospitalization assessment, bone marrow aspirate sampling, and disease assessment, if their disease has not transformed from HR MDS or CMML to AML (for patients with HR MDS or CMML) or progressed (for patients with low-blast AML), and they have not started 
subsequent therapy. Patients will enter OS follow-up (contacted every 3 months to document CCI

7subsequent therapies and survival status) when they have confirmed transformation to AML (for 
patient with HR MDS or CMML) or experienced progressive disease (patients with low-blast AML) 
or have started subsequent therapy.
Disease response assessments for all HR MDS/CMML patients will be based on the Modified 
International Working Group (IWG) response criteria for MDS [3]. Disease response assessments for 
patients with low-blast AML will be based on the Revised Recommendations of the IWG for 
Diagnosis, Standardization of Response Criteria, Treatment Outcomes, and Reporting Standards for 
Therapeutic Trials in Acute Myeloid Leukemia [4]. Formal disease assessments for study endpoints 
will be determined based on local bone marrow aspirate blast counts and transfusions, and central lab 
data (local lab data may be used for time-sensitive clinical decisions). 
Bone marrow samples (biopsy and/or aspir ate) will be collected at Screening, during treatment, and 
during follow-up for blast count evaluation (to inform disease burden assessment). Bone marrow 
aspirate will also be used to analyze tumor cytogenetics,  
 
Samples will be 
collected and analyzed from patients in both treatment arms. 
Inpatient hospital admissions related to HR MDS or CMML or low-blast AML, as well as RBC- and 
platelet-transfusion independence, will be monitored as secondary efficacy endpoints. Treatment- emergent resistance w ill also be monitored. 
Sparse sampling for the determination of pevonedistat plasma concentrations and, if appropriate, its 
metabolites will be collected from each patient in the Combination Pevonedistat Plus Azacitidine 
Arm to contribute to a population PK analysis of pevonedistat co-administered with azacitidine. 
Adverse events and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status will be 
assessed, and ECGs, clinical laboratory values, and vital signs will be obtained, to evaluate the safety 
and tolerability of the study drug treatments. Patient-reported HRQOL will be evaluated using the 
EORTC-QLQ-C30 and EQ-5D-5L (all patients) a nd the QOL-E (American English-speaking US 
patients only) questionnaires.
Study Population:
Patients may be male or female, and must be 18 years or older.
All patients must have morphologically confirmed diagnosis of MDS or nonproliferative CMML (ie, 
with WBC <20,000/ μL) or low-blast AML based on 1 of the following:

(a) Screening assessments will be performed within 28 days before randomization. Baseline assessments are defined as those pe rformed at the closest time before the start of study 
drug administration.
(b)Except for hematology, procedures conducted during the Screening period that are performed within 24 hours of Cycle 1 Day 1 can also be used as the baseline evaluation and do 
not need to be repeated. If dosing falls on a Monday, the collection window may be extended to collect samples on the previous Friday.
(c) On dosing days, all procedures are to be performed prior to pevonedistat or azacitidine dosing unless specified otherwise. 
(d) For a new cycle of treatment with study drug(s) to begin, toxicities considered to be related to treatment with study drug(s) must have resolved to the level or grade defined in 
Section 6.3.1 .
(e) The first dose of st udy drug must be administered within 5 days of randomization on study. It is strongly recommended that dosing for both treatm ent arms occur on the days 
specified. However, dosing of either drug may be delayed for safety reasons or other unavoidable circums tances (eg, weather conditions affecting clinic accessibility). If 
pevonedistat dosing is delayed, a minimum of 1 full calendar day between any 2 doses should be maintained. In each cycle, a maximum of 3 doses of pevonedistat and 7 doses 
azacitidine (as ap plicable) should not be exceeded. For the combination arm, pevonedistat and azacitidine should always be administered on the same day (eg, instead of 
pevonedistat dosing on Days 1, 3, and 5, it would be acceptable to dose on Days 1, 5, and 8). If dosing is adjusted, study procedures should be performed on the actual day of 
dosing.
(f) The EOT visit will occur 30 days (+10 days) after the last dose of study drug(s) or before the start of subsequent antineoplastic therapy if that occurs sooner. Af ter the EOT visit, 
patients will enter EFS follow -up if their disease has not transformed to AML (for patients with HR MDS or CMML) or enter response follow -up if their disease has not 
progressed ( for patients with low -blast AML) (as defined in Section 7.4.21 ), and they have not started subsequent therapy. Patients will enter OS follow -up when they have 
confirmed transformation to AML (for patients with HR MDS o r CMML at study entry), experienced progressive disease (for patients with low -blast AML at study entry), or 
have started subsequent therapy.
(g) Confirmation of patient eligibility by the sponsor’s project clinician (or designee) is required prior to rand omization. A Patient Eligibility Checklist must be completed and 
submitted by the investigator for review and approval by the sponsor or designee prior to patient randomization.
(h) See Section 15.7 for the modified Charlson comorbidity index. 
(i) Weight will be measured within 3 days before Day 1 dosing in each cycle, for calculating BSA. BSA will be calculated usin g a standard formula (see example in Section 15.8) on 
Cycle 1 Day  1, and on Day 1 of subsequent cycles if the patient experiences a 5% change in body weight from the weight used fo r the most recent BSA calculation.
(j) Vital signs, including diastolic and systolic blood pressure, heart rate, and body temperature will be collected at Screening, predose on Days 1, 3, and 5 on each treatment arm of 
each treatment cycle, at EOT, and as clinically indicated. Vital sign measurements will be taken with the patient in the supine or sitting position .
(k) Additional ECGs may be performed as clinically indicated.
(l) If a chest X -ray or chest CT scan was performed within 2 months prior to rando mization, the chest X -ray does not need to be performed during Screening.
(m) A serum pregnancy test will be performed for women of childbearing potential at Screening. A pregnancy test must also be perf ormed for women of childbearing potential at

available before the first dose is administered in that cycle. A pregnancy test will also be performed for women of childbearin g potential at the EOT visit. Pregnancy tests may also 
be repeated during the study if requested by an IEC/IRB or if required by local regulations.
(n) Clinical laboratory evaluations will be performed by a central laboratory. The central laboratory results also should be use d for determination of eligibility by the sponsor’s project 
clinician (or designee) prior to randomization. For dosing decisions and/or safety concerns, local hematology and chemistry res ults should be used; however, samples must still be 
sent to the central lab as well. Hematology and chemistry samples may be collected up to 3 days before Day 1 dosing and 24 hour s before Days 3 and 5 dosing, when required. 
Local laboratory evaluations may be done more frequently at the investigator’s discretion.
(o) Coagulation panel includes PT and aPTT (to be performed by the central laboratory).
(p) The complete chemistry panel will include the following: BUN, creatinine, sodium, potassium, chloride, carbon dioxide, gluc ose, urate, total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, ALP, 
LDH, AST, ALT, albumin, magnesium, phosphate, and calcium.
(q) The select chemistry panel will include the following: BUN, creatinine, total bilirubin, ALP, AST, and ALT.
(r) Blood phosphate test to be performed on Day 5 of each treatment cycle or the day on which the third dose of pevonedistat is given if it is not Day 5 (to be performed by the central 
laboratory).
(s) Reticulocyte counts and ferritin level testing will be performed by the central laboratory only. Reticulocyte count and ferr itin samples may be collected up to 3 days before Day 1 
dosing. 
(t) Urinalysis will include assessments of turbidity and color, pH, specific gravity, protein, ketones, bilirubin, occult blood , nitrite, glucose, and leukocyte esterase. Urine microscopic 
analysis will include erythrocytes, leukocytes, bacteria, casts, and crystals. These samples will be analyzed by a central labo ratory.
(u) Patient-reported outcomes (HRQOL) and hospitalization assessment (ie, details regarding any hospitalizations since the last  assessment) should be completed before any other 
study procedures are performed or study drug regimen is administered. The EORTC-QLQ-C30 and EQ-5D-5L will be completed for all patients, and the QOL-E will be 
completed for American English-speaking US patients only.
(v) Combination Pevonedistat Plus Azacitidine Arm only: blood samples (approximately 3 mL each) for the determination of pevonedi stat plasma concentrations will be collected 
during Cycle 1 at the following time points: Day 1 at the end of the pevonedistat infusion (immediately before stopping the inf usion), at 1.5 hours ( #30 minutes) and at 4 hours 
(#45 minutes) after completion of the pevonedistat infusion; Day 3 predose (within 10 minutes before azacitidine dosing); and Day 5  predose (within 10 minutes before 
azacitidine dosing), at the end of the pevonedistat infusion (immediately before stopping the infusion), and prior to the patie nt’s discharge from the clinic visit. The exact date and 
time of each sample collection and the actual start and stop times of the infusion should be recorded accurately, and particula r care should be given to the recording of blood 
sampling times that occur close to the infusion. Details regarding the preparation, handling, and shipping of samples are provi ded in the Study Manual.
(w) Combination Pevonedistat Plus Azacitidine Arm only: blood samples (approximately 3 mL each) for the determination of pevonedi stat plasma concentrations will be collected at 
Cycle 2 and Cycle 4 Day 1 (at the end of the pevonedistat infusion [immediately before stopping the infusion] and 3 hours [ #45 minutes] after completion of the pevonedistat 
infusion); an additional sample will be collected predose (within 10 minutes before azacitidine dosing) on Cycle 4 Day 3. The e xact date and time of each sample collection and 
the actual start and stop times of the infusion should be recorded accurately, and particular care should be given to the recor ding of blood sampling times that occur close to the 
infusion. Details regarding the preparation, handling, and shipping of samples are provided in the Study Manual.

(y) SAEs will be entered on the eCRF and also reported to  (see Section  10.2) . Serious pretreatment events (occurring before the first dose of any study drug) will only be 
reported to  and will not be entered on the eCRF. SAEs should be monitored until they are resolved or are clearly determined to  be due to a patient’s stable or chronic 
condition or intercurrent illness(es). 
(z) Subsequent therapy is defined as an agent(s) with antileukemic/anti-MDS activity (eg, cytarabine, anthracyclines, purine an alogues, and hypomethylating agents other than 
azacitidine). Patients who discontinue study treatment to receive single-agent azacitidine off study would not be counted as rec eiving subsequent therapy.
(zz) Combination Pevonedistat Plus Azacitidine Arm only: See Section  6.1.2 for pevonedistat dosing instructions. On Days 1, 3, and 5 when both study drugs are administered, 
azacitidine will be administered first followed by pevonedistat. Subsequent pevonedistat doses may be reduced due to toxicity in  accordance with Section  6.3. 
(zzz) All patients will receive azacitidine 75 mg/m2IV or SC on Days 1 through 5 (inclusive), Day 8, and Day 9 of each cycle in accordance with Section  6.1.1.  The azacitidine dose 
may be reduced due to toxicity in accordance with Section 6.3. CCI

(a) A bone marrow biopsy (in addition to bone marrow aspirate) is required only at Screening to confirm the diagnosis; bone m arrow aspirates will be collected at all other time 
points, at relapse or PD, and as clinically indicated (see Section 7.4.20 for detailed examples). However, a bone marrow biopsy may be collected with bone marrow aspirate in 
accordance with institutional guidelines. If a bone m arrow aspirate and biopsy were performed within 28 days prior to randomization, these archival samples may be used to 
confirm diagnosis and do not need to be repeated. However, a bone marrow aspirate for molecular analysis is still required at Screening (s ee footnote (f) below). The bone 
marrow pathology report(s) will be submitted to the central laboratory. If a bone marrow biopsy is not collected routinely pe r country institutional guidelines, it is not required.
(b) A bone marrow aspirate for blast count (to inform disease burden assessment) will be performed on Day 22 (+6 days) of Cycle 2, Cycle 4, and every 3 cycles thereafte r (Cycle 
7, Cycle 10, etc.). Results must be available before dosing starts in the next cycle. 
(c) Following Cycle 4, bone marrow aspirates will be performed only as clinically indicated in patients who achieve CR. In all other patients who do not achieve CR, bone marrow 
assessments will be performed after completion of every third treatment cycle. Additional bone marrow aspirates m ay be performed if warranted by changes in peripheral blood 
counts.
(d) Cytogenetics analysis will be done locally at the clinical site: a bone marrow aspirate sample will be tested according t o institutional guidelines in a cytogenetics laboratory 
routine ly used by  the site. Analyses should be done by karyotype, and by FISH if possible. Results will be collected in the eCRF and the cytogenetics report(s) will be submitted 
to the central laboratory . 
(e) Mutation analysis to be performed locally at the clin ical site according to institutional guidelines/standard practice (eg, genomic analysis or PCR analysis) and this information
will be collected from sites. If mutation analysis is not performed routinely per country/institutional guidelines, it is not requ ired. Results will be collected in the eCRF and the 
mutation analysis report(s) will be submitted to the central laboratory.
(f) A fresh bone marrow aspirate obtained at screening, any time prior to the first administration of study drug, will be use d for baseline molecular characterization. A bone marrow 
aspirate sample for molecular analysis will also be obtained on Day 22 (+6 days) of Cycle 2. Bone marrow aspirate samples wil l be sent to a central laboratory for molecular 
analysis.
(g) A bone marrow aspi rate sample for molecular analysis will be obtained on Day 22 (+6 days) of Cycle 4. A bone marrow aspirate sample for molecular analysis will also be 
obtained Day 22 (+6 days) of Cycle 7 for patients who do not have a confirmed CR at Cycle 4. Bone marrow a spirate samples will be sent to a central laboratory for molecular 
analysis.
(h) If relapse is suspected, the sample for molecular analysis will be collected at the time the bone marrow sample for disea se assessment is collected and sent to the central 
laboratory (per instructions in the Laboratory Manual).

251. BACKGROUND AND STUDY RATIONALE
1.1 Scientific Background
1.1.1 Diseases Under Treatment
Myel odysplast ic syndro mes (MDS) are a group of bio logically  and clinically  heterogeneous 
hematopoiet ic disorders derived fro m an abnorm al mult ipotent progenitor cell. The 
diagnosis of MDS is made based upon findings in the peripheral blood and bone marrow as 
interpreted wi thin the clinical context. Most cases of MDS are diagnosed based upon the 
presence of 3 main features:
Otherwi se unexplai ned quant itative changes in 1 or more of the blood and bone 
marrow elements (ie, red cells, granulocy tes, pl atelets). 
Morphol ogic evidence of significant dysplasia (ie, ≥10 percent of ery throid 
precursors, granulocy tes, or m egakary ocytes) upon visual  inspection of the 
peripheral  blood sm ear, bone marrow aspirate, and bone marrow biopsy  in the 
absence of other causes of dysplasia. 
Blast forms account for less than 20 percent of the total cells of the bone marrow 
aspirate and peri pheral  blood. Cases wi th higher blast percentages are considered to 
have acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). In additio n, the presence of myelo id 
sarcoma or certain genet ic abnormalit ies, such as those with t(8;21), inv(16), or 
t(15;17), are considered diagnostic of AML, irrespective of the blast cell  count.
MDS are classified using the World Healt h Organization (WHO) classificat ion system [6,7]
based upon a combination o f morphology , immunophenoty pe, genetics, and clinical 
features. The WHO classificat ion system was built  upon the French -American -British 
(FAB) Cooperative Group classificat ion [
5].
MDS are commonly divided into lower -or higher-risk categori es based on the Revised 
International Prognosti c Scoring System (IPSS -R) for MDS, which is a scoring system 
useful for estimat ing overall survival and the risk of transformation to AML [
2].Overall, 
approximately  25% of  patients wi th very  high, high, or interm ediate IPSS -R scores will 
transform to AML wit hin 0.7 y ears, 1.4 y ears, and 3.2 years, respect ively [2]. Medi an 
survival for patients with MDS varies fro m years to m onths and decreases wit h increasing 
IPSS
-R score.

26Because MDS are heterogeneous diseases, varied treatment options exist. Most patients with 
MDS are managed with non -curat ive treatment strategies to control symptoms, improve 
qualit y of life, improve overall survival (OS), and decrease progression to AML. Treatment 
of patients wi th lower -risk MDS (often defined as patients with <5% myelo blasts and/or 
norm al or good risk cy togenetics and few cytopenias) focuses on minimizing blood product 
transfusio ns and maximizing qualit y of life through use of supportive care (eg, antibiotics as 
needed for infect ions, red blood cell transfusions), growth factors such as ery thropoi esis 
stimu lating factors or immunosuppressive drugs. Treatment for patients with higher -risk 
disease often includes DNA hypo methylat ing agents (azacit idine and decitabine) [8]. Rarely, 
intensive chemotherapy is used in pat ients with higher -risk MDS (HR MDS), but it 
generally results in significant toxicit y and m odest responses 
(uptodate.com/contents/treatment -of-high-or-very-high-risk-myelodysplast ic-syndro mes, 
Treatment of hig h or very  high ri sk myel odysplastic syndrom es, Accessed 08 December 
2014) [
9-11] . 
Hypomethylat ing agents produce object ive hematologic responses in approximately half o f 
patients wi th MDS, del ay leukemic progression, improve qualit y of life, and, for azacit idine 
only, prol ong survival  in patients with HR MDS. Nevertheless, treatment with 
hypo methylat ing agents is not curative, and most patients relapse within 2 years. 
Lenalido mide, an immuno modulatory  thalidomide congener , significant ly improves red 
blood cell transfusio n
-independence rates and increases hemoglo bin, but it is approved only  
for use in patients with the 5q syndro me subt ype of low-risk MDS [9,10,12-14] .
The only known curative therapy  for MDS i s allogen eic stem  cell transplantati on. However, 
only a minori ty of patients (typically wi th HR MDS) undergo this procedure due to 
contraindicat ions and the limited availabilit y of appropriate stem cell donors [
15]. Even in 
these patients, treatment -related mortalit y and m orbidi ty and high rel apse rates com promise 
long-term disease -free survival (upt odate.com /contents/treatm ent-of-high-or-very-high-risk-
myelodysplast ic-syndro mes, Treatment of high or very high risk myelodysplast ic 
syndro mes, Accessed 08 December 2014) [10,16, 17]. More recent therapeutic approaches to 
patients wi th MDS wi th higher-risk disease have invo lved co mbining drugs with 
hypo methylat ing agents, either to take advantage of synergist ic properties of, for example, 
histone deacet ylase inhibit ion combined with epigenet ic modificati on, or to capi talize on 
non
-overlapping mechanisms of action [18,19] .
As detailed by  Zandberg et al , 2013 [
20], chronic myelo monocy tic leukemia (CMML) is a 
clonal stem  cell disorder that di splays fea tures of both MDS and a myeloproliferative

27neopl asm. Diagnosti c criteria for CMML include persistent peripheral blood monocy tosis 
(>10x109/L), absence of the Philadelphia chromosome and/or BCR -ABL1 fusio n gene, 
absence of platelet -derived growth factor rec eptor or gene rearrangement, fewer than 20% 
blasts in the blood and the bone marrow, and dy splasia of 1 or more myelo id lineages [21]. 
CMML was classified as an MDS in the FAB classificat ion system in 1982 [
5], but was 
subsequent ly reclassified as a mixed myelodysplastic/myeloproliferat ive disorder by  the 
WHO classificat ion system in 2001 [
22]. CMML shares clinical and bio logical features with 
MDS, including development of cy topenias and bone marrow failure, risk of progressi on to 
AML, and overlapping recurring cytogenet ic abnormalit ies. Like MDS, i t has a vari able 
clinical course, with reported rates of transformat ion to AML of 15% to 52% and a median 
OS of 12 to 18 months [
23-25] . Treatment modalit ies for the 2 diseases are also similar, 
including hematopoie tic growth factors (ery thropoiesis -stimulating agents and granulocyte 
colony-stimulat ing factor), transfusio n support, hypomethylat ing agents, and allogeneic 
hematopoiet ic stem cell transplantation. 
Prognosti c scoring systems for MDS, including the IPSS -R scoring system used in this 
study , have been routi nely applied to pati ents wi th CMML and have been shown to be 
predi ctive of both transformat ion to AML and overall survival [26]. 
Low m arrow bl ast count (20% -30%) WHO -
defined AML was previously classified as 
refractory  anemia wi th excess blasts in transformatio n (RAEB -t). WHO cri teria now define 
AML as > 20% bone m arrow bl asts. In a phase 3 rando mized trial, azacit idine significant ly 
prolonged overall survival co mpared wit h conven tional care regimens (CCRs) in pat ients 
with higher risk MDS [13].A subgroup analysis o f 113 elderly pat ients (median age, 
70years) compared the effects of azacit idine versus CCRs o n overall survival o f these 
FAB -defined RAEB -t and WHO -defined AML [
13].Median overall survival for 
azacit idine-treated pati ents was 24.5 months co mpared wi th 16.0 months for CCR -treated 
patients (hazard rati o=0.47). Furthermore, azacit idine was associated with fewer total days 
in the hospital than CCR. In another phase 3 study , 191 pati ents wi th high er-risk MDS by 
FAB criteria were rando mlyassigned to azaci tidine or bes t supportive care [
27]. Of these, 
45patients had WHO
-defined AML. Response rates to azacit idine were similar in MDS and 
these low m arrow bl ast AML pati ents. Azacit idine was associated with improvements in 
physical funct ion, symptoms, and psycho logical state. Pati ents assigned to supportive care 
were permitted to cross over to azaci tidine at the time of progression; this design limited 
survival analysis. Based on these studi es, azaci tidine-based therapy  is a standard of care in 
low marrow blast coun t WHO -defined AML .

281.1.2 Study Drug: Pevonedistat
Pevonedistat (MLN4924; TAK -924) i s a fi rst-in-class small mo lecule inhibitor of the 
NEDD8 (neural precursor cell expressed develo pmen tally down -regul ated protein 
8)-activating enzyme that is being developed for the t reatment of malignancies. 
NEDD8- activat ing enzyme (NAE) is an E1 activating enzyme and is an essent ial component 
of the NEDD8 conjugat ion pathway , which controls the act ivity of a subset of ubiquit in E3 
ligases, mult iprotein co mplexes that transfer ubiquit in molecules to protein substrates that 
are then targeted to the proteasome for degradation. Cullin -dependent ubiquit in E3 ligases 
(CDLs) require conjugation to NEDD8 to be activated. Cullin dependent ubiquit in E3 
ligases control the timely ubiquit ination and consequent proteasomal degradation o f proteins 
with important rol es in cell cycle progression and signal transduct ion, cellular processes that 
are integral to tumor cell growth, proliferat ion, and survival. Inhibitors of NAE activit y may 
be of therapeut ic value in the treatment of various cancers by disrupt ing proteasomal 
degradation of a variet y of critical regulatory  proteins. As detailed in Section 1.5, the 
nonclinical and preliminary  clinical experience in AML with pevonedistat alone or in 
combinat ion supports further evaluat ion in the subset of patients who are classified as HR 
MDS orCMML or low- blast AML.
1.2 Nonclinical Experience
1.2.1 Single -Agent Pevonedistat
Pevonedistat is a potent and selective inhibitor of NAE activit y.
Pevonedistat treatment of cultured tumor cells resulted in growth inhibit ion of a wide variety 
of cell lines derived from acute leukemias, lymphomas, mult iple myelo ma, and a range of 
solid tumor ty pes. Changes in protein levels observed in cultured cells treated with 
pevonedistat were consistent with the inhibit ion of NAE :inparticular ,a decrease in 
NEDD8- cullin levels and a reciprocal increase in the levels of known CDL substrates, 
including NFE2- related f actor 2 (Nrf2) and chromatin -licensin g and DNA -replicat ion 
factor -1 (Cdt -1). In most cell lines evaluated, NAE inhibit ion by pevonedista t led to DNA 
re-replicat ion and accumulat ion of cells in the S phase of the cell cycle; this resulted in DNA 
damage and subsequent cell death through apoptosis [28-30] .
Pevonedistat demonstrated pharmacodynamic and ant itumor activit y in so lid tumor, 
lympho ma, and AML xenograft models when administer ed to immunocompromised mice 
by the subcutaneous (SC) route. Very  few preclinical models of HR MDS are available, and 
pevonedistat has not been tested specifically in HR MDS.

29In vitro assay  resul ts indicated a l ow risk for hum an ether -à-go- go related gene (hERG) 
channel inhibit ion by pevonedistat or its 3 major circulat ing metabolites. In a Good 
Laboratory  Practi ces (GLP) -compliant cardi ovascular safet y pharmaco logy assessment in 
male beagle dogs dosed via intravenous (IV) infusion at 15, 30, or 40 mg/kg (3 00, 600, or 
800mg/m2, respectively), pevonedistat was not well tolerated at doses 30 m g/kg 
(≥600 mg/m2). Mortali ty and/or m oribundit y were observed wit hin 24 hours postdose as a 
resul t of gastrointestinal injury (muco id/soft feces, diarrhea with so me macroscopic 
correl ations [reddened mucosa]) at 40 mg/kg. In a separate GLP -compliant, 2 -cycle, 
repeat -dose toxico logy study  in dogs, no test article -related effects were noted in the 
electrocardi ogram  (ECG) data .
The systemic toxicit y of pevonedistat was a ssessed in GLP -compliant repeat -dose studies in 
rats and dogs. The dose -limit ing toxicit ies (DLTs) in the 2- cycle studi es for both speci es 
were gastrointestinal toxicit y and bone m arrow and lympho id tissue deplet ion. Most adverse 
effects were resolving or had resolved after a 2 -week recovery  period. Pevonedistat did not 
resul t in lethalit y in eit her of the 5 -cycle studies. The primary adverse test article -related 
effects in IV -dosed dogs included an acute phase response (increased body  temperature, 
decrease d albumin, increased globulin, increased mo nocy tes and neutrophils, and increased 
fibrinogen levels); neutrophilic infiltrates in mult iple tissues; and in males, vacuo lation and 
degeneration of the seminiferous epithelium o f the testes. Most adverse effect s were 
reversing or had reversed after a 2 -week recovery period in both rats and dogs. Given that 
there were prominent effects on testes and ovaries noted at all doses tested in the 
GLP -compliant repeat -dose toxico logy studi es in both dogs and rats, pevonedistat likely 
represents a substant ial reproductive and developmental hazard.
Detailed informat ion regarding the nonclinical pharmaco logy and toxi cology of pevonedistat 
may be found in the Investigator’s Brochure (IB).
1.2.2 Pevonedistat With Azacitidine 
The c ombinat ion of pevonedistat with azacit idine demonstrated synergist ic or addit ive 
effects on viabilit y of AML cell lines treated in vit ro. Combinat ion index analysis 
demonstrated synergy of pevonedistat with azacit idine in 2 AML cell lines ( OCI-M2 and 
NB-4)and addit ivity in 2 addit ional AML cell lines (THP -1 and HL60). The combinat ion of 
pevonedistat and azacit idine in HL60 and OCI -M2 cell lines resulted in increased DNA 
damage (measured by  phospho -H2AX) and apoptosis (measured by cleaved caspase -3) 
compared to the levels of these markers induced by  single -agent pevonedistat or azacit idine.

30The benefit of the combinat ion of pevonedistat with azacit idine was confirmed in vivo with 
immunocom promised mice bearing HL -60, OCI -M2, and THP -1 subcutaneous tumor 
xeno grafts. Pevonedistat in combinat ion withazaciti dine dem onstrated addi tive or 
synergistic ant itumor activit y and tum or regressi on in all  3subcutaneous xenograft models, 
which represent both azacit idine-sensi tive (OCI -M2) and azacit idine-insensit ive (HL60 and 
THP -1) models. In OCI -M2, azacitidine and pevonedistat as single agents inhibited tumor 
growth, but the combination o f these agents resulted in tumor regressions with a statist ical 
assessment of synergy. In THP- 1, although pevonedistat as a single agen t inhibi ted tum or 
growth without causing regressio ns and azacit idine as a single agent had only  a marginal  
effect on tumor growth, the combinat ion caused regressio ns and delayed tumor regrowth 
following the treatment period. In HL60, tumor regressio ns were seen with the co mbination 
of pevonedistat and azacit idine at dose l evels that had minimal or moderate antitumor 
activit y as single agents. Furthermore, in a disseminated xenograft model in which HL60 
cells were inoculated into immunocompro mised mice by IV injection, pevonedistat and 
azacit idine as single agents both extended survival time compared to a control group, but the 
combinat ion extended survival t ime longer than would be expected from an addit ive 
combinat ion, thereby  dem onstrating a synergist ic effect on survival .
Detailed informat ion regarding the nonclinical pharmaco logy and toxi cology of pevonedistat 
may be found in the IB.
1.3 Clinical Experience
As of 22 January  2015, pevonedistat has been administered to 351 patients in clinical 
studi es. These i nclude 227 pati ents di agnosed wi th advanced malignancies including solid 
tumors, AML, m elano ma, lympho ma, multiple myelo ma, HR MDS, and acute 
lymphoblast ic leukemia who participated in studies of single -agent pevonedistat. In ongoing 
combinat ion studi es: 42 el derly  patients wi th treatment -naïve AML (Study  C15009) have 
been treated with pevonedistat plus azacit idine; 58 patients with so lid tumors have received 
combinat ion treatments with docetaxel, gemcitabine, or a combinat ion of carboplatin and 
paclitaxel (Study  C15010); and 24 pati ents with advanced solid tum ors have received a 
single IV dose of pevonedistat alone and in combinat ion with the cytochrom e P450 (CYP) 
3A inhibitor probes, itraconazo le or fluconazole, wit h the opti on to then continue receiving 
pevonedistat plus standard of care, either docetaxel, or carboplat in plus paclit axel (Study  
C15011) .

31Pevonedistat has reported single -agent clinical act ivity in a phase 1 study  (Study  C15003) in 
relapsed/refractory  AML pat ients[31]. In Study  C15003, responses (complete responses and 
partial responses) were observed in a variet y of patient settings, including postallogeneic 
transpl ant, therapy -related AML, and primary refractory  AML. Investigators should note 
that som e patients may  benefi t from continued treatm ent even though their bone marrow 
blast counts may fluctuate over the cour se of the first 4 cycles. For example, 2 of the 
6responders in Study  C15003 had asymptomat ic, transient increases in bone marrow blasts 
after achieving a response. In these 2 cases, bone marrow blasts increased fro m less than 5% 
to more than 20%, and then went down. In addit ion, another responder in that study  had an 
asymptomat ic, transient increase in bone marrow blasts before achieving a response. In that 
case, bone marrow blasts almost doubled before response. These 3 patients were allowed to 
remain on study  because thei r invest igators felt they were clinically benefit ing from 
continued treatment despite changes in their bone marrow blast counts. 
In addit ion, Study  C15009 i s current ly evaluat ing the co mbinat ion of escalat ing doses of 
pevonedistat on Day s 1, 3, and 5 pl us 75 m g/m2azaci tidine administered (IV or SC) on a 
5-on/2-off [weekend]/2 -on schedule in 28 -day cycles in treatm ent-naïve AML patients, age 
≥60 y ears, who are unlikely to benefit from standard induct ion therapy  [32]. Enrollment in 
Study  C15009 i s complete; however, final data are not y et available. Data available as of 
26September 2014 showed that 29 patients (median age 78.0 years; 17 [59%] men) had 
received pevonedistat 20 mg/m2(n=26) o r 30 mg/m2(n=3). Primary  diagnoses were 
19(66%) de novo AML and 10 (34%) secondary  AML. Seventeen (59%) patients had 
intermediate -risk cy togeneti cs and 7 (24%) had adverse -risk cy togeneti cs (5 [17%] 
undetermined). The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was det ermined to be 20 mg/m2
pevonedistat in co mbination wit h 75 m g/m2azacit idine. During dose escalat ion, DLTs at the 
30 m g/m2pevonedistat dose level included reversible Grade 2 increased bilirubin (n=1) and 
Grade 3/ Grade 4 increased transaminases (n=1) wit hout clinic al sequelae. In 1 of the 
22patients treated at the MTD, 1 addit ional DLT (Grade 4 aspartate aminotransferase 
[AST]/al anine aminotransferase [ALT] elevat ion) was seen in the expansio n cohort; thi s 
patient was successfully re -challenged with a reduced pevonedistat dose. The most commo n 
adverse events (AEs; reported by  ≥25% of patients) were constipat ion, febrile neut ropeni a,

32pharmacokinet ics (PK) data showed that the addit ion of azacit idine did not alter the known 
PK profile o f single -agent pevonedistat.
In the 25 response -evaluable pat ients, there were 5 (20%) complete remissio ns(CRs), 
2(8%) complete remissio ns wi th incomplete blood count recovery  (CRis), and 6 (24%) 
partial remissi ons (PRs), for an overall response rate of 52%. Eleven of the 13 responses 
occurred within the first 2 cy cles of therapy  and incl uded 2 pati ents wi thbone marrow blasts 
>80%. Combinat ion therapy  with pevonedistat plus azacit idine was generally well tolerated. 
The characteristics of the observed responses suggest added benefit from the addit ion of 
pevonedistat compared wit h azacit idine alone in treatmen t-naïve AML patients, age 
≥60years, who are unlikely to benefit fro m standard induct ion therapy . Furtherm ore, the 
overall response rate is not appreciably  different from  that of the subset of low -blast AML 
patients (blast count <30%), further supporting t he use of this co mbination in this study’s 
patient popul ation.

1.4 Pharmacokinetics of Pev onedistat
1.4.1 Nonclinical Pharmacokinetics and Risk Assessment for Drug- Drug 
Interactions
The absorption, distribut ion, metabo lism, and excretion properties of pevonedistat have been 
studi ed in Sprague -Dawley rats, beagle dogs, cynomo lgus mo nkeys, and chimpan zees. The 
whole blood clearance is low in all animal species, likely as a result of the extensive 
partitioning of pevonedistat into red blood cells. The plasma terminal disposit ion half-life 
(t1/2)varied fro m short (l ess than 1 hour in rats) to relat ively long (15 hours in monkeys). 
The m ajor eliminat ion pathway  of pevonedistat in animals is through the hepat ic route. 
Urinary  excret ion of unchanged pevonedistat was negligible (<5%) in rats and primates. 
After an IV dose of [14C] pevonedistat, radioactivit ywas primarily  excreted in the feces in 
intact rats and in bile duct -cannulated rats; excret ion was almost complete by  24 hours 
postdose. No plasma metabo lite accounted for more than 10% of the total plasma 
radioactivi ty, suggesting potenti ally low systemi c exposure to metabo lites. 
In vitro pevonedistat is metabo lized via hydroxylatio n and oxidat ion, predominantly by 
CYP3A4 wit h a small contribut ion from CYP2D6. Results from the co mpleted drug -drug 
interact ion (DDI) Study  C15011 indicated that multiple- dose administration o f fluconazo le, 
a moderate CYP3A inhibitor, had no clinically relevant effects on the PK of pevonedistat.

33Pevonedistat systemic exposure in the presence of itraconazo le, a strong CYP3A inhibitor, 
was only minimally increased co mpared with that in the absence of itraconazo le (geometric 
mean dose -norm alized AUC ∞ratio of 1.14 [90% CI ,1.07 to 1.23 ]). The 14% increase in the 
pevonedistat geometric mean dose -norm alized AUC was not considered clinically  
meaningful when viewed in the context of pevonedi stat overall PK variabilit y (coefficient of 
variat ionin AUC ∞, 16%- 34%), supporting inference of the lack of a clinically relevant 
effect of itraconazole, a strong CYP3A inhibitor on total systemic exposure (AUC) of 
pevonedistat (see Section 1.6.3 ). Pevonedistat does not inhibit CYP1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 
and 3A4/5, and weakly  and reversibly  inhibi ts both CYP2B6 and 2C8; it does not induce 
CYP1A 2, 2B6, and 3A4/5. When viewed in the context of clinically  relevant concentrati ons 
at 20 mg/m2(mean single -dose maximum [peak] concentration [C max] of ~0.5 µM), 
pevonedistat is unlikely to affect the PK of drugs that are metabo lized by these CYP 
enzymes.
In vitro, pevonedistat is a substrate for the drug efflux transporters P -glycoprotein (P -gp) 
and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) and is also a weak inhibitor of BCRP -mediated 
transport (concentrations producing 50% inhibit ion [IC 50] of 6.3 M). Additional transport 
studi es wi th organic anio n-transporti ng po lypept ides (OATP) in sandwich -cultured human 
hepatocy tes showed that pevonedistat can inhibit the hepat ic uptake of estrone -3-sulfate 
(IC 50of 29.1 µM) while inhibit ion of OATP -mediated upt ake of simvastatin and lovastatin 
(IC 50of 0.4-4.9 µM and 0.9 µM, respectively) was observed in so me, but not all, donors. On 
the basis o f these data, pevonedistat at clinically relevant concentrations is unlikely to affect 
the PK of other drugs that are k nown BCRP or OATP substrates (IC 50 >10-fold the unbound 
Cmaxeven wi th the l owest estimated value), whereas the potential exists, albeit low, for drug 
interact ions wit h BCRP inhibitors. Refer to Section
 1.6.3 for a summary  of potenti al clinical  
DDIs, and Sections 6.4and 6.5for excluded and permitted concomitant medicat ions in this 
study .
Addit ional details on nonclinical PK informat ion are provi ded in the IB.
1.4.2 Clinical Pharmacokinetics
Clinical pharmacokinet ic data are summarized in Section 5.2 of the IB. Single -and 
multiple-dose PK of pevonedistat have been evaluated in adult patients with solid tumors or 
hematol ogic malignancies. In these studies, pevonedistat was administered IV at d ose levels 
of 25 to 278 m g/m2and wi th various daily or intermittent dosing schedules wit hin 21 -day 
treatm ent cycles. Pl asma concentrations of pevonedistat declined in a mult i-exponent ial

34manner at the end of a 1 -hour IV infusio n, wi th little or no notabl edrug accum ulation upon 
repeat dosing. This observat ion is consistent with a mean terminal eliminat ion half-life o f 
approximately  10hours (range, 7.7- 15.2 hours) estimated across doses and schedules. 
Pevonedistat PK was linear over the dose range studied based on a daily area under the 
plasma concentration -time curve (AUC 0-24hr) that increased proportionately  with dose. 
Consistent with in vitro data, pevonedistat was also found to extensively part ition in human 
blood (m ean bl ood-to-plasma concentration rat io of ~65) with observed concentrations of 
pevonedistat in who le blood and plasma declining in parallel over 24 hours. Upon 
explorat ion of the effects of patient -specific covariates on pevonedistat populat ion PK, body  
size and age influenced clearance of p evonedistat, while only body  size was important for all 
volume of distribut ion parameters. Addit ionally , data are available in 29 treatm ent-naïve, 
elderly  patients with AML who received IV pevonedistat at 20 mg/m2(n=26) and 30 m g/m2
(n=3) on Day s 1, 3, an d 5 in combinat ion with IV/SC azaci tidine 75 mg/m2on a 5 -on/2-off 
(weekend)/2 -on schedule (Study  C15009) [32]. These data indicate that pevonedistat PK 
remains unaffected by  5 continuous days of azacit idinedosing when compared to 
single
-agent pevonedistat data from the earlier study  in patients with AML (Study  C15003).
1.5 Study Rationale
MDS include a heterogeneous group of myelo id disorders characterized by ineffect ive 
hematopoiesis and transformat ion to AM L. Treatment wi th azaci tidine increases OS in 
patients wi th HR MDS rel ative to convent ional care [13]. Consequent ly, azacit idine is 
approved in many countri esas a single agent in HR MDS.
Pevonedistat is an invest igational, first -in-class inhibitor of the NEDD8
-activat ing enzyme 
that has reported single -agent clinical act ivity in a phase 1 study  in patients with 
relapsed/refractory  AML [31]. Based on nonclinical studies in AML models that 
demonstrated a synergist ic lethalit y in cell lines and tumor regression in murine xenografts 
when pevonedistat was combined wit h azacit idine, pevonedistat is being studied in 
combinat ion with azaci tidine in treatm ent-naïve elderly patients with AML who are unlikely 
to benefit fro m standard induct ion therapy  (Study  C15009). Preliminary  resul ts suggest that 
20mg/m2pevonedistat plus azacit idine is generally well tolerated and demonstrates early 
signs of  clini cal activity [32]. 
1.5.1 Rationale for Study Population
Given the overlapping treatments and pathophysio logy between HR MDS and AML, this 
phase 2 study  will evaluate OS and EFS (in HR MDS or CMML ,an event is d efined as

35transformation to AML or death; in low-blast AML, an event is defined as death) of the 
combinat ion of pevonedistat and azacit idine compared withsingle- agent azaci tidine as a 
treatm ent for HR MDS or CMML or low- blast AML. Patients with CMML are included 
because CMML shares clinical and bio logical  features wi th MDS, has a similar variable 
clinical course, and treatment modalit ies for the 2 di sease s are al so similar (see 
Secti on1.1.1 ). Patients with CMML were also included in rando mized studies o f azacit idine 
conducted in the United States (US) and the European Unio n with similar response rates to 
patients wi th MDS [13,27] . The rati onale for including low marrow blast count (20% -30%) 
WHO -defined AML i s because l ow m arrow bl ast count AML had been previously  classified 
as refractory  anemia wi th excess blasts in transformat ion (RAEB -t), which was part of the 
MDS spectrum, and it is a populati on of  patients wi th AML who have been shown to benefit 
from azacit idine-based therapy (see Section
 1.1.1 ).
1.5.2 Rationale for the Combination of Pevonedistat Plus Azacitidine
The rati onale for com bining pevonedistat with azacit idine in pat ients with AML and MDS is 
2-fold; namely, the single -agent ac tivity observed with azacit idine [13]and pevonedistat 
[
33]in patients with AML or related diseases such as MDS, and the preclinical evidence 
supporting t he improved benefit of pevonedistat administered in co mbinat ion with 
azacit idine in AML xenograft models; see Section 1.2.2 and the IB for more inf ormation. 
1.5.3 Rationale for Dose and Schedule of Study Drugs
The cho ice of doses and schedules for this study  was based on Study  C15009, which 
established the MTD of pevonedistat as 20 mg/m2given on Days 1, 3, and 5, in combinat ion 
with 75mg/m2azacit idine given on Day s 1 through 5, 8, and 9, in 28- day treatm ent cy cles. 
The DLTs supporting this determinat ion were elevations in liver funct ion tests (LFTs; see 
Secti on 1.3and the IB for more informat ion). 
The commo nly used schedule of azacit idine administration in the U nited States is a 
5-on/2-off (weekend)/2 -on schedule to avoid the logist ical limit ations associated wi th 
administering drugs to patients during the weekend . According to oncologist/hematologist 
surveys conducted by  the sponsor, of the patients treated with azacit idine for AML in the 
United States, approximately  70% f ollow this schedul e. Garci a et al  conducted a 
retrospective evalua tion of  3schedules o f azacit idine administration in 181 patients wi th 
MDS . Evaluated patients received 75 mg/m2azaci tidine on one of the following schedules : 
5days, 5-on/2-off/2 -on, or daily for 7 days. The overall response rates (38%, 71%, and 52%,

36respectively) favored 5-on/2- off/2-on administration of azacitidine over a 7-day 
administration, with p = 0.0418. All schedules were well tolerated [34].
In this study, azacitidine may be administered  using either the SC or the IV route of 
administration, given that comparable systemic exposures (AUC 0-48hr) to azacitidine were 
achieved following either route in Study C15009. Furthermore, it has been reported that 
azacitidine is generally w ell tolerated regardless of the route of administration [35], which is 
also supported by preliminary data from Study C15009.
As detailed in Section  1.3, some patients in Study C15003 (single-agent pevonedistat in 
patients with relapsed/refractory AML) derived clinical benefit from continuing study treatment despite changes in their bone marrow blast counts. Standard MDS guidelines [36]
also recommend treatment for 6 cycles without altering dose or frequency of azacitidine 
regardless of cytopenias. Patients with HR MDS or CMML may be allowed to continue 
study treatment (either treatment arm) if th ey meet the criteria for progressive disease based 
only on bone marrow blast count (without AML transformation) if, in the clinical judgment 
of the investigator, the patient is still receivi ng clinical benefit from this treatment and the 
continuation is endorsed by the sponsor’s project clinician (or designee). Patients with low-blast AML, in this study, may also be allowed to continue study treatment (either treatment 
arm), even if they meet the criteria for progressive disease based only on bone marrow blast 
counts, if, in the clinical judgment of the investigator, the patient is still receiving clinical 
benefit from this treatment, and the continuation is endorsed by the sponsor’s proj ect 
clinician (or designee). Patients who meet the criteria for PD and continue on study under 
these conditions must be reconsented before continuing study treatment. If a patient has 
<50% increase in blast count from pretreatment, then this is stable disease and the patient 
should remain on study. 
1.5.4 Rationale for Molecular Analyses
Both AML and MDS are heterogeneous diseases with respect to both tumor biology and 
clinical outcome. Various studies confirm that survival for individual patients in both 
diseases is heavily influenced by the specific molecular pathology of their tumors. Along 
with age and performance status, cytogenetics are a key clinical predictor, and cytogenetic findings are incorporated into risk categorization schemes to guide treatment. CCI

38Leukemic cells that remain in the bone marrow following treatment are a major cause of 
disease relapse. Measurable residual disease (MRD) testing provides the sensitivity and 
specificity to identify the presence of these residual cells. Studies have shown that the 
sensitive detection of a leukemia-specific marker (eg, a mutation in the gene encoding nucleophosmin [ NPM1 ]) could improve prognostication by identifying submicroscopic 
disease during remission [51]. Assessment of MRD is receivin g recognition as a potential 
tool to assess the quality of response after chemotherapy and to plan post-remission 
strategies. PCR and multiparametric flow cytom etry have become the most popular methods 
to investigate MRD in AML [52]. Methods to assess MRD by next-generation sequencing
(NGS) are also being explored [53].CCI

401.5.5 Rationale for Health-Related Quality of Life Assessments
When caring for patients with advanced and life-threatening diseases such as cancer, 
preserving their health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and reducing symptom burden are 
among the most important therapeutic goals. However, there are limited data on patient 
reported outcomes (PROs) among patients with HR MDS. In previous randomized clinical trials among patients with MDS, patients on the azacitidine arm experienced improvement in 
HRQOL as assessed by the EORTC-QLQ-C30 PRO instrument [62].
To compare the impact of treatment between the 2 patient groups in this study, HRQOL will 
be assessed by 3 instruments: EORTC-QLQ- C30 and EQ-5D-5L (all patients) and the 
QOL-E (US patients only). Data from these 3 instruments will facilitate assessment of important general, cancer-specific, and MDS-specific HRQOL domains and items, and 
ascertainment of how these may be correl ated with certain clinical outcomes.
The EORTC-QLQ-C30 [63], designed to assess health-related quality of life in a wide range 
of cancer patient populations, has been admin istered in multiple randomized clinical trials of 
patients with MDS [62,64] . 
While the EORTC-QLQ-C30 assesses important HRQOL domains including global health 
status/quality of life, functioning, and symptoms over the past week, the QOL-E wasdeveloped specifically for patients with MDS, with evidence for reliability and validity in 
this patient population [65]. As such, it is used to assess the specific impact of MDS on 
HRQOL that is not measured in general non–MDS-specific instruments.
Because oncology therapies may positively or negatively affect a patient’s quality of life, a 
common methodological approach used to quantify this effect is to “quality-adjust” survival rates in comparative treatment arms. The resulting data, referred to as quality-adjusted life 
years (QALYs), provide a measure of both the length and quality of life and are used for 
economic evaluation of new therapies. The data required for the assessment for QALY is captured by EQ-5D-5L.
Refer to Section  7.4.16 for additional details on the components and administration of these 
questionnaires. CCI

411.6 Potential Risks and Benefits
1.6.1 Azacitidine
In clinical studies, adverse react ions to azacit idine were qualitatively similar between the IV 
and SC routes of administration [35]. In clinical studies with SC administration of 
azacit idine, adverse react ions of neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, nausea, vomit ing, 
diarrhea, consti pation, and inject ion site ery thema/reacti on tended to increase in incidence 
with higher doses of azacit idine. Adverse react ions that tended to be more pronounced 
during the first 1 to 2 cy cles of SC treatm ent com pared wi th later cycles inc luded 
thrombocy topenia, neutropenia, anemia, nausea, vomit ing, injection site 
erythema/pain/bruising/react ion, constipat ion, petechiae, dizziness, anxiet y, hypokal emia, 
and inso mnia. There did not appear to be any adverse reactions that increased in freque ncy 
over the course of treatment.
Adverse reactions that appeared to be specifically associated with the IV route of 
administration included infusio n site reactions (eg, erythema or pain) and catheter site 
reacti ons (eg, infection, ery thema, or hem orrhage) .
Adverse reactions ident ified during postmarketing use of azacit idine include interst it
ial lung 
disease, tum or lysis syndrome, i nject ion site necrosis, and Sweet’s syndrome (acute febrile 
neutrophilic dermatosis).
Refer to the VIDAZA (azacit idine) US Pres cribing Information (USPI) [35],or the European 
Unio n (EU) Summary of Product  Characteristics (SmPC) [66], as applicable, for the most 
recent informat ion regarding the ant icipated risks and benefit s of azacit idine.

subsequent cy cles based on nadir counts and hematologic response (see Sect ion 6.3.2.1 ).
1.6.1.2 Severe Pre -existing Hepatic Impairment
Cauti on is needed in pat ients with liver disease when administering azacit idine. Patients 
with extensive tumor burden due to metastatic disease have been reported to experience 
progressive hepat ic co ma and death during azacit idine treatment, especially in such patients

42with baseline albumin <30 g/L [67]. Azacit idine is contraindicated in patients with advanced 
malignant hepat ic tumors. 
1.6.1.3 Renal Abnormalities
Patients wi th renal impairment should be closely  monitored f or toxi city because azacit idine 
and its metabolites are primarily  excreted by  the kidneys. Renal abnormalit ies ranging fro m 
elevated serum  creat inine to renal failure and death have been reported in pat ients treated 
with IV azaci tidine in co mbinat ion with other chemotherapeut ic agents for non -
MDS 
condi tions. Renal tubular acidosis, defined as a fall in serum bicarbonate to <20 mEq/L in 
associ ation with an alkaline urine and hypokalemia (serum potassium <3 mEq/L), developed 
in 5 pat ients with chronic myelogenous leukemia treated with azacit idine and etoposi de.
1.6.2 Pevonedistat Plus Azacitidine
In the ongoing clinical study  of the combinat ion of pevonedistat and azacit idine in 
treatm ent-naïve patients wi th AML, age ≥60 years (S tudy C15009), am ong 
25response -evaluable patients, 28% had a best response of CR or CRi  (26September 2014 
data cut) [32]. A majorit y of the responses have occurred within the first 2 cycles. Responses 
have been seen in patients with hyperproliferat ive phenotypes and adverse cyto genetics. 
None of the clinical data observed thus far suggest any lack of efficacy relat ive to 
established therapies that would const itute a significant risk to the patient populat ions in the 
clinical studies.
Preliminary safet y data (as of 28 August 2015) from 56 pat ients in Study  C15009 who 
received ≥1 dose of the combination o f pevonedist at and azacit idine indicate that the very

The m ost detailed informat ion on risks is provided in the Invest igator’s Brochure and the 
Developmental Core Safet y Informat ion (DCSI) located within the Invest igator’s Brochure.
Overall ident ified risks of pevonedistat include increased heart rate, diarrhea, nausea, 
vomiting, abnormal LFTs, py rexia, myalgia, and musculoskeletal pain. 
Hepatotoxi city: Hepatotoxi city has been noted following administration of pevonedistat in 
patients wi th advanced malignancy , including el evati ons of  liver transaminases (up to 
Grade 4), alkaline phosphatase (up to Grade 3), and bilirubin (up to Grade 3). Grade 1
through 4 increases in alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase have been 
observed in patients receiving single -agent pevonedi stat f or relapsed and/or refractory  AML . 
The patients experiencing these changes in laboratory  values have been asymptomatic . This 
type of elevat ion in transaminases had been observed previously in pat ients treated with 
pevonedistat . The el evations in laboratory  values have been reversible with dose 
modificati on including dose delay and reduct ion. Patients with elevated t ransaminases have 
been successfully rechallenged at lower doses . 
Some events are considered potential risks of pevonedistat because of the occurrence of 
these events in phase 1 clinical studies in which single -agent pevonedistat was administered

with secondary sepsis, effects on testes and ovaries that represent a reproductive hazard 
including sterilit y, increased developmental risk to fetus or embryo, decreased trabecular 
bone (graded minimal to moderate) was noted in the femur and in the sternum in rats at all 
dose groups (low, m edium, high) (thisfinding was considered adverse in the high -dose 
group; however, no bone fractures were noted at any o f the doses), prol ongati on of  the 
activated thromboplastin time (aPTT), and local tissue injury  when administered 
subcutaneously (SC). Addit ional details may be found in the current IB .
Based on the known individual safet y profiles of pevonedistat and azacit idine, the following 
potenti al risks of combinati on therapy  may apply: myelosuppressio n, gastrointestinal events, 
electroly te imbalances, hypophosphatem ia, decreased renal funct ion, hepatotoxicit y, cardi ac 
arrhy thmias, cardi omyopathies, m uscul oskeletal  pain, bleeding, and inject ion site reactions.
In Study  C15009, pati ents receive azacit idine as either an IV infusio n or subcutaneous 
inject ion. Preliminary data indicate that the route of azacit idine administration has no 
apparent effect on the safet y profile of pevonedistat plus azacit idine. 
1.6.3 Potential for Drug- Drug Interactions
No formal clinical  assessments of DDIs between azacit idine and other agents ha ve been 
conducted. Please consult the VIDAZA USPI (Clinical Ph armacology [Secti on 12.3], 
Drug -Drug Interactions) for addi tional informat ion [35].
The potential risk of DDIs between pevonedistat and conco mitantly administered drugs is 
currently informed by  available nonclinical and clinical data (see IB and Section
 1.4). Study  
C15011, a phase 1 study  to assess the effect of multiple doses of fluconazo le (a moderate 
CYP3A inhibitor) as well as the effect of mul tiple doses of i traconazol e (a strong CYP3A 
inhibitor) on the PK, safet y, and tol erabili ty of a single dose of IV pevonedistat (see 
Secti on1.4.1 ) was completed. Based on results from C15011, administration of pevonedistat 
with moderate and strong CYP3A inhibitors is permitted in this study , while use of strong 
CYP3A inducers should be avo ided. As a general precaution, patients receiving conco mitant 
medicat ions, particularly  those wi th narrow therapeuti c indices, shoul d be carefully 
monitored as the DDI potential between pevonedistat and other drugs has not been formally 
studi ed in humans. Pati ents shoul d also be instructed to consult with the invest igator before 
taking any  new medicat ions, including over -the-counter products and herbal supplements.

504. STUDY DESIGN
4.1 Overview of Study DesignThis study is a multicenter, global, randomized, controlled, open-label, phase 2 clinical 
study of the combination of pevonedistat a nd azacitidine versus single-agent azacitidine 
administered in patients with HR MDS or CMML and low-blast AML (see inclusion criteria 2and 3for definitions) who have not previously received a hypomethylating agent. Patients 
with nonproliferative CMML (ie, white blood cell [WBC] <20,000/ μL) are included because 
these patients were also included in both randomized studies of azacitidine conducted in the 
US and the European Union with similar response rates to patients with MDS.
General eligibility may be assessed prior to the formal Screening period if it is part of 
standard clinical practice. However, per the  Schedule of Events,  formal screening will occur 
during the Screening period, which may last up to 28 days prior to randomization. The CCI

51sponsor’s project clinician (or designee) will confirm patient eligibilit y prior to 
rando mizat ion by the invest igator.
It is expected that approximately 117 patients will be enrolled in this study . Once enrolled, 
patients (MDS, CMML, and low -blast AML) will be randomized at a 1:1 ratio to receive 
study  drug (ei ther single -agent azaci tidine or the combinat ion of pevonedistat and 
azacit idine) in 28- day treatm ent cy cles. All pat ients will be stratified i nto 4 categories: 
low-blast AML, IPSS -R risk groups of very  high, high ,or interm ediate for MDS/CMML 
[2]. Note that patients with HR MDS/CMML with indeterminate cy togenet ics findings at 
Screening should be assigned a cy togenetics prognostic variable of 2 points, ie, intermediate, 
for dete rmining overall Prognostic Risk Category/Score; see Section
 7.4.4 . All patients will 
receive azacit idine (75 m g/m2[IV or SC]) on Days 1 through 5, Day 8, and Day 9. Patients 
rando mized to the combinat ion arm  will also receive pevonedistat (20 mg/m2via 
60([±10] -minute infusio n) on Day s 1, 3, and 5. Modificat ions to the dos e and schedule may  
be allowed as detailed in the Schedule o f Events and Section 6.1.
Patients, including those who achieve a CR, may  receive study  treatm ent until they 
experience unacceptable toxicit y, rel apse, transformat ion to AML, or PD as defined in 
Secti on 7.4.21 . Patients with HR MDS or CMML may be allowed to continue study 
treatment (either treatment arm) if they meet the criteria for progressive disease based 
only on bone marrow blast count (without AML transformation) if, in the clinical 
judgment of the investigator, the patient is still receiving clinical benefit from this 
treatment and the continuation is endorsed by the sponsor ’s project clinician (or 
designee). Patients with low -blast AML in this study may also be allowed to continue 
study treatment (either treatment arm), even if they meet the criteria for progressive 
disease based only on bone marrow blast counts, if, in the clinical judgment of the 
investigator, the patient is still receiving clinical benefit from this treatment and the 
continuation is endorsed by the sponsor’s project clinician (or designee). Patients who 
meet the criteria for PD and continue on study under these conditions must be 
reconsented before continuing study treatment. Patients m ay choose to di scontinue 
therapy  at any  time. 
Patients will  attend the End -of-Treatm ent (EOT) visit 30 days (+10 day s) after the l ast dose 
of study  drug or before the start of subsequent antineoplastic therapy if that occurs sooner. 
After the EOT visit, patients will enter EFS follow -up (for patients with HR MDS or 
CMML) or response fo llow-up (for pati ents wi th low-blast AML), with study visits every 
3months, to include physical exam, clinical blood tests, HRQ OL assessments,

52hospitalization assessment, bone marrow aspirate sa mpling, and disease assessment, if their 
disease has not transformed to AML (for patients with HR MDS or CMML) or progressed 
(for patients with low-blast AML), and they have not started subsequent therapy. Patients 
will enter OS follow-up (contacted every 3 months  to document subsequent therapies and 
survival status) when they have confirmed transformation to AML (for patients with HR MDS or CMML) or experienced progressive disease (for patients with low-blast AML) or 
have started subsequent therapy.
Disease response assessments for all patients with HR MDS or CMML will be based on the 
Modified International Working Group (IWG) response criteria for MDS [3]as detailed in 
Section  7.4.21.  Disease response assessments for patients with low-blast AML will be based 
on the Revised Recommendations of the IWG for Diagnosis, Standard ization of Res ponse 
Criteria, Treatment Outcomes, and Reporting Standards for Therapeutic Trials in Acute 
Myeloid Leukemia as detailed in Section 7.4.21 [4]. Formal disease assessments for study 
endpoints will be determined based on lo cal bone marrow aspirate blast counts and 
transfusions, and central lab data (local la b data may be used for time-sensitive clinical 
decisions).
Inpatient hospital admissions related to HR MDS or CMML or low-blast AML, as well as 
transfusion independence, will be monitored as secondary efficacy endpoints. RBC- and 
platelet-transfusion independence requires that the p atient receive no RBC or platelet 
transfusions, respectively, for a period of at lea st 8 weeks. Treatment-emergent resistance 
will also be monitored.
A bone marrow aspirate and biopsy will be collected at Screening, and bone marrow 
aspirates will be collected during treatment and follow-up for blast count evaluation (to 
inform disease burden assessment).

53Sparse sampling for the determination of pevonedistat plasma concentrations and, if 
appropriate, its metabolites will be collected from each patient in the Combination 
Pevonedistat Plus Azacitidine Arm as described in the  Schedule of Events to contribute to a 
population PK analysis of pevonedistat co-administered with azacitidine. 
Adverse events and ECOG performance status will be assessed, and ECGs, clinical 
laboratory values, and vital signs will be obtained, to evaluate the safety and tolerab ility of 
the study drug treatments. Toxicity will be ev aluated according to National Cancer Institute 
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Even ts (NCI CTCAE), Version 4.03, effective 
date 14 June 2010 [68]. Dose modification guidelines are presented in Section 6.3. 
4.2 Number of Patients
Approximately 117 patients (rando mized in a 1:1 ratio) w ill be enro lled in this study from 
approximately 80 study centers globally. Enrollment is defined as when the patient is randomized onto study treatment.
4.3 Duration of Study
Patients, including those who achieve a CR, may receive study treatment un til they 
experience PD or discontinuation for any other reason outlined in Section  7.5. Patients will 
be followed until approximately 60% of patients with HR MDS/CMML have experienced 
OS events, or termination of the study by th e sponsor. Patients who are still receiving study 
treatment and continuing to derive clinical benefit may continue to receive pevonedistat at the discretion of the sponsor; the continuation of treatment may occur in  a manner other than 
under the study protocol, in accordance with local regulations.
After discontinuing study treatment (including th e EOT visit), patients will be followed for 
survival, subsequent therapy, and transform ation to AML (for patients with HR MDS or 
CMML), or progression and relapse from CR (patients with low-blast AML).CCI

596. STUDY DRUG
6.1 Study Drug Administration
All protocol -specific criteria for administration of study  drug m ust be m et and docum ented 
prior to drug administration. Study  drug will be administered only to eligible pat ients under 
the supervisio n of the invest igator or ident ified subinv estigator(s).
The first dose of study  drug m ust be administered wi thin 5 days of randomizat ion on study . 
It is strongly  recommended that dosing for both treatment arms occur on the day s specified 
(ie,azacit idine dosing on Days 1 -5, 8, and 9; pevonedistat dosing on Days 1, 3, and 5). 
However, dosing of either drug may be delayed for safet y reasons or other unavo idable 
circumstances (eg, weather affect ing clinic accessibilit y). If pevonedistat dosing is delayed , 
a minimum of 1 full calendar day between any 2 doses shoul d be m aintained. In each cycle, 
a maximum  of 3doses of pevonedistat and 7 doses azacit idine (as applicable) should not be 
exceeded. For the combination arm, pevonedistat and azacitidine should always be 
administered on the same day (eg, instea d of pevonedistat dosing on Days 1, 3, and 5, it 
woul d be acceptable to dose on Day s 1, 5, and 8). If dosing is adjusted, study  procedures 
shoul d be perform ed on the actual  day of dosing.
The am ount of  study  drug (pevonedistat and/or azacit idine, as applic able) to be administered 
will be based on body  surface area (BSA). BSA will be calculated using a standard formula 
(see example in Sect ion15.8) onCycle 1 Day  1, and on Day  1 of subsequent cy cles if the 
patient experiences a 5% change in body  weight from  the wei ght used for the m ost recent 
BSA calculat ion.
6.1.1 All Patients –Azacitidine Dosing
All patients will receive azacit idine (75 mg/m2[IV or SC, per investigator’s cho ice]) on 
Days 1 through 5, Day  8, and Day  9 of each treatment cy cle. The invest igator, without 
approval  of the sponsor’s proj ect clinician, may  choose to swi tch the route of azacit idine 
administration at any  time based on standard of care, clinical preference, or convenience. 
Please see the m ost recent VIDAZA (azacit idine) USPI [35] or EU Sm PC [ 66], for details 
on azacit idine administration .
6.1.2 Additional Instructions for the Combination Arm –Pevonedistat Plus 
Azacitidine Dosing
Patients assigned to the Combination Pevonedistat Plus Azacit idine Arm will receive 
azacit idine as described in Sect ion6.1.1 and will also receive pevonedistat (20 mg/m2) via

6060(±10) minute infusio non Days 1, 3, and 5. All doses must be taken as outlined in the
Schedule of Events .
Patients will  receive pevonedistat diluted with 5% dextrose in a 250 -mLbag via a 60- minute 
IV infusio n per the informat ion provi ded in the Directions for Invest igational Drug Use 
docum ent located in the Pharmacy Manual. Pevonedistat should be administered through 
central  or peri pheral  venous access. The infusio n may be slowe d or stopped and restarted for 
any associated infusion -related reacti ons. All infusio n times must be recorded. The total 
time fro m drug reconstitution to end of infusio n must not exceed 6 hours.
The ent ire content of the pevonedistat IV bag will be infused at a constant rate over 60 (±10) 
minutes. The start and end time of IV infusio n shoul d be recorded accurately , particularly in 
Cycle 1, when PK assessments are performed. To ensure that all the pevonedistat is 
administered, the infusio n line will be flush ed wi th saline or 5% dextrose immediately  after 
administration. The vo lume used for line flushing is not considered a part of the vo lume of 
the pevonedistat IV bag to be documented.
On Days 1, 3, and 5, when both study  drugs are administered, azacitidine w ill be 
administered first fo llowed by  pevonedistat. The infusio n of pevonedistat will begin 
between 15 and 60 minutes after completion o f administration of SC azacit idine, and 
between 30 and 60 minutes after completion o f administration of IV azacit idine. 
6.2 Reference/Control Therapy: Azacitidine
Azacit idine is a chemical analogue of cy tidine that is wi dely used for the treatment of 
patients wi th AML. A phase 3, randomized, open -label, internat ional study  com pared 
azacit idine (75 m g/m2SC daily  for 7 day s, every 28 day s) wi th invest igator selected, 
convent ional care regimens (CCRs) (eg, best supportive care, low dose cy tarabine, or 
intensive chemotherapy) in 358 patients with HR MDS as defined at that time [13].
Approximately  one thi rd (n=113) of the pati ents in this study  had refractory  anemia wit h 
excess blasts in transformat ion (RAEB -t; 20% -30% bone marrow blasts); under the 2008 
WHO revised criteria, RAEB -t is now defined as AML [6]. A subanalysis of the study  
compared the rel ative efficacy and safet y of azaci tidine versus CCR in this patient subgroup 
(median age, 70 years) [
69]. Of these 113 patients with WHO -defined A ML, 86% were 
considered unfit for intensive chemotherapy. Two -year OS rates were higher wit h 
azacit idine versus CCR in the pat ients considered unfit for intensive chemotherapy (51% vs 
13%, respectively, p=0.0003). In addition, azacit idine was associated wi th fewer total  days

61in the hospital (26.0 vs 50.9 day s per pati ent-year; relat ive risk=0.48; 95% confidence 
interval  [CI] 0.44 -0.52; p<0.0001) than CCR. In patients with unfavorable cytogenet ics, 
median OS in the azacit idine (n=14) and CCR (n=13) groups wa s 12.3 and 5.3 months, 
respectively  (hazard rati o=0.66; 95% CI 0.26 -1.68; p=0.38), whereas the 2 -year OS rate was 
38% for azacitidine, with no patients surviving mo re than 20 months in the CCR group 
(p=0.01) [69].
In a rando mized phase 3 trial o fazacit idine versus CCR in o lder patients with newly 
diagnosed AML, the m edian OS wi th azaci tidine was 10.4 months, a 3.8 month (58%) 
increase over CCR. One -year survival with azacit idine was 47%, a 36% increase over CCR. 
Although the study  did not reach s tatistical significance for its primary endpoint of OS 
(p=0.08), azacitidine demo nstrated a clinically meaningful improvement. A sensit ivity 
analysis of OS censoring at subsequent AML therapy  dem onstrated a statist ically significant 
benefit for azacit idineversus CCR (12.1 vs 6.9 months, respect ively; p=0.0147) [
70].
6.3 Dose Modification Guidelines
6.3.1 Criteria for Retreatment and Dose Delays
Retreatment Within a Cycle
If dosing of either drug is delayed for safet y reasons, retreatment may  be resumed upon 
resol ution of the safet y condi tion to ≤Grade 1. For pevonedistat , a minimum o f 1full 
calendar day between any  2doses shoul d be maint ained. In each cycle, a maximum of 
3doses of pevonedistat and 7 doses azacit idine (as applicable) should not be exceeded. If 
azacit idine is held for whatever reason, it may  be resumed to com plete a full treatment 
course as long as the full 7 doses are completed within the first 14 days of the cycle.
If dosing is interrupted within a cycle because o f drug-related toxicit y, and if the invest igator 
and the sponsor’s project clinician (or designee) agree that it is in the pa tient’s interest to 
continue therapy  with the study  drug(s), then after recovery  of the toxi city or toxi cities in 
question to Grade 1 or to the patient’s baseline values, the dose of study  drug m ay be 
reduced. For toxicit y not related to drug (eg, disease -related toxi city), although a similar 
dose reduction is permitted, in general it is discouraged. If the reduced dose is well tolerated 
and the toxicit y leading to dose reduction was ≤Grade 3, has resolved, and does not reoccur, 
the dose m ay resume at the original  dose l evel in the next cycle after endorsement by  the 
sponsor’s project clinician (or designee). For specific guidelines on azacit idine and 
pevonedistat dose reductions, see Sections 6.3.2 and 6.3.3).

62Initiation of a New Cycle
Treatment with study  drugs will be repeated every  28days.It is strongly  recommended that 
dosing for both treatment arms occur on the day s specified. However, the initiation of a new 
cycle may be del ayed f or safet y reasons or other unavoidable circumstances (eg, weather 
affect ing clinic accessibilit y). For thera py to resume, nonhematologic toxicit y considered 
related to treatm ent wi th study  drugs m ust have resolved to Grade 1, to the patient’s 
baseline values, or to a level considered acceptable by  the invest igator after discussion wit h 
sponsor’s project clinici an (or desi gnee). Cri teria for dosing in a new cycle related to 
hematol ogic toxici ties are detailed for azacit idine in Section 6.3.2.1 and for pevonedistat in 
Secti on 6.3.2.2 .
If a patient fails to meet the criteria for retreatment, init iation of the next cycle of treatment 
may be delayed for up to 2 weeks. At the end of that time, the patient should be re -evaluated 
to determine whether the criteria for retreatment have been met. A dose reduction (as 
detailed in Sect ions 6.3.2 and 6.3.3 ) would be triggered if treatment is delayed for >2 weeks 
because of inco mplete recove ry from treatm ent-related toxi city. If the reduced dose i s well  
tolerated and the toxicit y leading to dose reduction was ≤Grade 3, has resolved, and does not 
reoccur, the dose may  resume at the ori ginal  dose level in the next cycle after endorsement 
by the sponsor’s project clinician (or designee).
6.3.2 Dose Modification for Hematologic Toxicities
6.3.2.1 Azacitidine
Dose reduction or delays of azaci tidine for hematologic toxicit ies (including fever and 
neutropeni a) during the first 6 cycles of therapy  are strongly discouraged, as i t may impact 
patient outcom e. Any  potenti al dose reducti on shoul d be di scussed and agreed first with the 
sponsor’s project clinician (or designee).
For hem atologic AEs, the start of a new treatment cy cle shoul d be delayed and/or dose 
modifications shoul d be consi dered if:
Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) is <500/µL. For patients with disease -related 
neutropeni a, physician discretion may  be used to init iate therapy  with ANC ≥50% of 
baseline (baseline from the start of the previous cycle). In ge neral, the use of growth 
factors should be restricted. However, to avoid dose delay , pati ents who experience 
Grade 4 neutropenia (ANC <500/µL) with or without fever may receive granulocyte 
colony-stimulat ing factor (G -CSF) or granulocyte macrophage co lony-stimulating

63factor (GM -CSF) between days 28 to 42 day s of azaci tidine m onotherapy  or 
combinat ion after discussio n and agreement with the sponsor’s project clinician (or 
designee) . Any use of growth factors will be documented in the electronic case 
report form (eCRF). Pati ents who receive myelo id growth factors will not be 
included in assessment of neutrophil response.
Platelet coun t is <20,000/µL. For patients with disease -related thrombocy topeni a, 
physician discretion may  be used to init iate therapy  with platel et count ≥50% of 
baseline (baseline from the start of the previous cycle). If the above criteria are not 
met, the start of the new cycle will be delayed unt il the above criteria are met. If a 
low ANC or pl atelet count causes the delay  of the start of the new cy cle of  more than 
2 weeks, then the azacit idine dose will be decreased to 50 mg/m2when treatm ent is 
resum ed. Treatm ent m ay be held up to 6 weeks (42 day s) due to toxicit y before 
patient m ust be rem oved from  protocol  therapy . 
If the reduced dose is well tolerated and the toxicit y leading to dose reduction was ≤Grade 3, 
has resolved, and does not reoccur, the dose may resume at the original dose level in the 
next cy cle after endorsement by  the sponsor’s project clinician (or designee).
If indicate d, bone m arrow eval uation will be performed to establish whether cont inued 
myelosuppressio n is related to persistent or progressing leukemic infiltrat ion. 
6.3.2.2 Pevonedistat
It is not anti cipated that pevonedi stat dose m odificati ons woul d be necessary  due to 
myelosuppressio n. However, if clinically indicated in the opinio n of the invest igator, the 
pevonedistat dose may be reduced from 20 mg/m2to 10 m g/m2. The pevonedistat dose may  
be re -escalated to 15 mg/m2or 20 m g/m2at the next cy cle, if the toxicit y has r ecovered to 
≤Grade 1 or the patient’s baseline. 
Although leukostasis is not anticipated in this study, pevonedistat should be held for 
symptoms of leukostasis unt il the leukostasis is treated per inst itutional guidelines. 
Pevonedistat may be restarted when WBC count is <50,000/µL and fo llowing agreement by  
the sponsor’s project clinician (or designee).

646.3.3 Dose Modification for Nonhematologic Toxicities
6.3.3.1 Azacitidine
Azacitidine Dose Adjustment Based on Renal Function and Serum Electrolyt es
For renal  toxicities, specifically elevated creatinine >Grade 1, azacit idine shoul d be reduced 
in accordance wit h the prescribing informat ion [35] and/or institutional guidelines. 
Similarly, if unexplained elevat ions in serum creat inine or blood urea nitrogen (BUN) occur, 
the next cycle should be delayed until values return to normal or baseline values, and the 
dose should be reduced by 50% on the ne xt treatment course. 
If unexplained reductions in serum bicarbonate levels to <20 mEq/L occur, the azacit idine 
dose should be reduced by 50% on the next course. The azacit idine dose may be re -escalated 
back to 75 mg/m2at the next cycle, if the toxicit y has recovered to ≤Grade 1 or the patient’s 
baseline status. 
6.3.3.2 Pevonedistat
Pevonedistat Dose Adjustment Based on Serum Transaminases and Total Bilirubin
It is ant icipated that LFTs (AST, ALT, and occasionally bilirubin) may be elevated for 
approximately  48 hours fo llowing the end of pevonedistat infusio n on Cy cle 1 Day  1. 
For el evated LFTs of Grade 2 or 3 that occur on or after Cy cle 1 Day  3, pevonedistat should 
be held; once the elevated AST or ALT returns to ≤Grade 1, and/or elevated bilirubin 
returns to 1.5ULN or the patient’s baseline level , pevoned istat dose may be resumed at 
20mg/m2. For pevonedistat , a minimum o f 1full cal endar day between any  2doses should 
be maintained, and a maximum o f 3doses of pevonedistat within the cycle must not be 
excee ded. 
For el evated LFTs of Grade 4 that occur on or after Cycle 1 Day  3, the pevonedistat dose 
shoul d be held for the remainder of the cycle; if the elevated AST or ALT returns to ≤Grade 
1, and/or elevated bilirubin returns to 1.5ULN or the patient’s baseline level , then 
pevonedistat may be restarted at the next cy cle at a reduced dose of 10 mg/m2. If the toxicit y 
returns to ≤Grade 1 or the patient’s baseline status, pevonedistat may be re -escalated to 
15mg/m2 for the next cy cle. After 1 cy cle at 15 m g/m2, further re -escalation to 20 mg/m2
may occur only after the patient’s liver function test (AST, ALT, and bilirubin) have been 
confirmed to be Grade 1, the same level as the patient’s baseline values, or a level 
considered acceptable by the invest igator and the sponsor’s project clinician (or designee).

If hypophosphatemia is ≥Grade 3, study  drug treatment shoul d not be resum ed unt il the 
hypophosphatemia is ≤Grade 2. Hy pophosphatemia shoul d be eva luated (including severit y 
and et iology), monitored, and treated according to inst itutional guidelines. 
Pevonedistat Dose Adjustment for Other Toxicities
For other ≥Grade 2 nonhematologic toxicit ies potent ially related to pevonedistat, the 
pevonedistat do se may be reduced from 20 mg/m2to 10 m g/m2at the di scret ion of the 
investigator as clinically  indicated. If the toxi city returns to ≤Grade 1 or the patient’s

696.7.2 Combination Pevonedistat Plus Azacitidine
Commo n AEs reported for patients receiving the combinat ion of pevonedistat and 
azacit idine are listed in Sect ion1.6. Also see the most recent IB. For the Combinat ion 
Pevonedistat Plus Azacit idine Arm, follow the guidance in the following subsect ions of this 
protocol .
Guidance for Clinical Assessment and Management of Hemodynamic Compromise 
It is essential that the pat ients receiving the combination of pevonedistat and 
azacitidine are carefully evaluated at Screening and before each dose of study drug for 
early symptoms and signs of hemodynamic compromise and/or active infection. 
Particular attention should be paid to u nexplained fever, tachycardia, hypotension, 
orthostasis, tachypnea, recent nausea and vomiting, and clinical evidence of 
dehydration. Patients who experience an untoward reaction with the combination of 
pevonedistat and azacitidine should be followed close ly on subsequent dosing.
For patients for whom there is a concern of dehydration, the following guidance for 
rehydration before pevonedistat dosing may be considered: 500 mL/hour of 
0.5Nsaline given over 2 to4 hours for a total of 1 to 2 L of fluid as c linically 
appropriate; each infusion of IV fluids should be recorded in the eCRFs.
For all patients with anemia, and especially for those with hemoglobin values ≤8g/dL 
at Screening or during the conduct of the study, RBC transfusions should be 
considered before pevonedistat dosing based on the risk of inadequate oxygenation, 
underlying cardiopulmonary status, clinical judgment, and/or hospital guidelines. 
Similarly, for patients with clinically significant thrombocytopenia, especially those 
with platelet count <10,000/ µL, a platelet transfusion should be considered. Any RBC 
or platelet transfusion must be recorded in the eCRFs.
Patients who experience signs and symptoms of hemodynamic compromise after 
pevonedistat dosing (eg, tachycardia, hypotension, ortho stasis, changes in mental 
status, syncope, and dizziness) should be followed closely and managed with supportive 
care, including hospitalization, as clinically indicated.
Guidance Management of Leukostasis 
Pevonedistat treatm ent shoul d be wi thheld for pat ients who develop symptoms of 
leukostasis (see Sect ion 6.3.2.2 ). Treatment may include leukapheresis and hydroxyurea

70administration, per inst itutional guidelines. When the WBC of the patient is <50,000/ L and 
symptoms are improved, pevonedistat treatment may be restarted after consult ing wit h the 
sponsor’s project clinician (or designee). Azacit idine treatment may continue as clinically 
indicated.
Guidance for Management of Extravasation
Based on nonclinical findings as detailed in the IB, pevonedistat is considered a nonvesicant 
drug. Al though no published guidelines are available for extravasat ion of nonvesicants, the 
investigator is encouraged to follow inst itutional guidelines. Som e general  advice in case of 
extravasat ion includes immediately stopping drug infusio n and elevating the affected limb to 
minimize swelling.

737.3 Treatment Group Assignments 
Patient eligibilit y will be established before randomizat ion into the study  as pati ents will  not 
be permitted to re -enroll. Confirmat ion of patient eligibilit y by the sponsor’s project 
clinici an (or desi gnee) fo llowing review and approval of a Patient Eligibilit y Checklist is 
requi red pri or to randomizat ion. A centralized randomizat ion and stratificat ion using an 
interact ive web response system (IWRS) will be used. Patients will be rando mized s trictly 
sequent ially at a center as they  become eligible for randomizat ion and will be stratified as 
detailed in Sect ion 8.1.2. The study  drug regimen must be init iated wi thin 5 days of 
rando mizat ion on study .If a pat ient discontinues from  the study , his/her randomizat ion code 
will not be reused, and the patient wil l not be allo wed to re -enter the study. 
7.4 Study Procedures
Refer to the Schedule of Events for timing of assessments. Addit ional details are provided as 
necessary  in the secti ons that follow, and in the Study  and Laboratory  Manuals. When

747.4.2 Inclusion/Exclusion Confirmation
During the screening process, a Patient Eligibilit y Checklist must be completed and 
submitted by  the invest igator for review and approval by the sponsor or designee prior to 
patient randomization. Completion of the eligibilit y checklist i s necessary  to verify that the 
patient has met all of the inclusio n and exclusion criteria. Source documentation allows for 
independent verificat ion that patient eligibilit y has been determined by the proper 
methodol ogy. Unless specifically  requested, addi tional source docum entati on does not need 
to be submitted with the checklist for the assessment of eligibilit y related to the other 
inclusion and exclusio n criteria.
7.4.3 Patient Demographics
The date of birth, race, ethnicit y, and sex of the patient are to be recorded during Screening.
7.4.4 Medical History and IPSS -R Risk Categorization
During Screening, a complete medical history  will be com piled for each pati ent. The history  
will emphasize the background and progress of the patient’s HR MDS orCMML or 
low-blast AML (see inclusion criteria 2 and 3, Sectio n5.1, for definit ions), including an 
assessment of bone marrow morpho logy (see Section 7.4.20 for addi tional details on bone 
marrow sample co llection and evaluat ion). Information regarding any prior therapy  for HR 
MDS orCMML or low- blast AML, including start and stop dates of each therapeutic agent 
and response to therapy , will be collected in the eCRF. In addit ion, all blood transfu sions 
related to HR MDS orCMML or low-blast AML that the patient received within 8 weeks 
prior to randomizat ion will be recorded to document baseline transfusio n dependence. 
For pati ents wi th HR MDS or CMML (but not for patients with low- blast AML), screening 
assessments must include risk categorizat ion (for patients both wit
h HR MDS and with 
CMML) according to the IPSS -R [2]. Source documents supporting the prognostic risk 
category  determinat ion may be requested with the Patient Eligibilit y Checklist for review by 
the sponsor prior to randomization (see Sect ion 7.4.2 ).
The IPSS -R Prognostic Score values based on specific criteria are provided in Table 7.a, and 
the IPSS -R cytogenetic risk groups are provided in Table 7.b. Cytogen etic risk groups and 
bone marrow blast percent ages will be based upon results from the local laboratory , while

80sufficient space and time to complete the qu estionnaires. The pat ient should co mplete the 
questionnaires on their own without any  assistance fro m site staff or a caregiver. The 
questionnaires are intended to be self- reported and should not be interviewer administered.
The study  coordinator should check the quest ionnaire for completeness and encourage the 
patient to com plete any  missing responses. Detailed instructions relat ing to the 
administrative procedures of the questionnaires will be provided to the sites. Patient’ s 
refusal to complete all or any  part of a questi onnai re shoul d be docum ented in the eCRF. 
EORTC -QLQ -C30
The EORTC -QLQ -C30 incorporates 5 funct ional scales (physical  functioning, role 
funct ioning, emotional funct ioning, cognit ive functi oning, and soci al functioning), 1 global 
healt h status scale, 3 symptom scales (fat igue, nausea and vo miting, and pain), and 
6individual items (dyspnea, inso mnia, appetite loss, constipat ion, diarrhea, and financial 
difficult ies). Most of the 30 items have 4 response levels (not at all , a little, qui te a bi t, and 
very much), wi th 2 questions relying on a 7 -point numeric rating scale. Raw scores are 
converted into scale scores ranging fro m 0 to 100. For the funct ional scales and the global 
healt h status scale, higher scores r epresent better HRQOL; whereas for the symptom scales 
lower scores represent better HRQOL. All items in this quest ionnaire relate to a recall period 
of 1 week.
QOL -E
The QOL -E assesses HRQOL in 5 general do mains (ge neral well -being, physical 
well-being, fu nctional well -being, social well -being, sexual well -being) and disease -related 
issues, with a recall period of 1 week with the excepti on of  1 general healt h item (1month). 
A higher score indicates a better HRQOL for that domain . The QOL -E will be administ ered 
to American English -speaking pat ients in the US only.
EQ-5D-5L
The EQ -5D- 5L is a self -administered preference -based measure of healt h status suitable for 
calculat ing QALYs to inform econo mic evaluat ions. EQ -5D- 5L includes 5 dimensions 
(mobilit y, self-care, usual activit ies, pain/disco mfort, anxiet y/depressio n) and 5 response 
levels for each do main (no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, 
and extreme problems). Patients are asked to indicate their healt h state by  select ing the most 
appropriate level of severit y on each of the 5 dimensi ons. Pati ent responses to the 
5dimensio ns of the EQ -5D- 5L represent the patient’s healt h state that is transformed to a

are used to inform economic evaluations. There is also a visual analogue scale used by 
respondents to rate their health on a scale from best (100) to worst (0).
7.4.17 Hospita lization Assessment
During study treatment and EFS follow-up periods for HR MDS/CMML patients or 
response follow-up for patients with low-blas t AML, all hospitalizations  since the previous 
assessment will be collected from all patients as indicated in the  Schedule of Events.  
Examples of data to be collected are number and duration of inpatient hospitalizations,location of admission (eg, ICU, hospital floor bed), and reason(s) for admission and primary 
diagnosis at discharge. Transfusion data will also be collected. For example, the number of 
patients who received pRBCs and number of units received, number of patients who received a platelet transfusion and number of units received, and location of transfusion 
(inpatient vs outpatient).
7.4.18 Pharmacokinet ic Measurements
Blood samples (approximately 3 mL each) for the determination of pevonedistat (and its 
metabolites, if  appropriate) plasma concentrations will be collected from all patients in the 
Combination Pevonedistat Plus Azacitidine Arm at the time points indicated in the  Schedule 
of Events.  The exact date and time of each sample collection, as well as the actual start and 
stop times of the study drug administration, should be recorded accurately, and particular care should be given to the recording of blood sampling times that occur close to the 
infusion.
To ensure that the measurements are representative of plasma exposure, blood draws will be 
conducted in the arm opposite to a patient’s IV infusion. In the case that only a single arm is available, blood should be drawn as distal to th e site of IV i nfusion as f easible, and the site 
of blood draw should be documented.
Details regarding the preparation, handling, and shipping of samples are provided in the 
Study Manual.

827.4.20 Bone Marrow Aspirate and Bi opsy Collection and Analysis
Bone Marrow Sample Collection for Disease Assessment
Bone marrow aspirates and biopsies will be required during the study as detailed in the  Bone 
Marrow Collection and Assessment Schedule.  
In addition, a bone marrow assessment will be performed for disease assessment at relapse 
(or suspected relapse) or PD, and if otherwise clinically indicated (eg, major changes in the patient’s underlying hematological disease are suspected). Note that the detection of 
circulating blasts is not by itself a sufficient criterion for relapse, but should trigger a bone 
marrow examination to determine whether a relapse has occurred. Other examples of triggers for ad hoc bone marrow examination may include a 50% reduction from maximum remission/response in granulocytes or platelets or a reduction in hemoglobin by ≥2 g/dL that 
is not considered drug related (eg, do not recover), or the hematologic values prompt new or 
more frequent transfusion support than the patient’s baseline status. 
A bone marrow biopsy (in addition to bone marrow aspirate) is required only at Screening to 
confirm the diagnosis. However, a bone marrow biopsy may be collected with bone marrow 
aspirate in accordance with institutional gui delines. If a biopsy was done within 28 days 
prior to enrollment, this archival biopsy may be used and does not need to be repeated. If CCI

83bone marrow biopsy is not collected routinely per country/institutional guidelines, it is not 
required.
Bone marrow samples will be analyzed locally at the clinical site to: 
!Determine blast count on aspirate samples : Samples will be evaluated locally for 
blast count per institutional standard pr actice to inform disease burden assessment. 
Samples will also be sent to a central laboratory for confirmation of bone marrow 
blast count. 
!Analyze cytogenetics for IPSS-R score determination and disease response 
assessment for patients with HR MDS and CMML.  
 A portion of the bone marrow aspirate 
sample at Screening will also be sent to each site’s preferred cytogenetic laboratory 
for cytogenetics assessment according to institutional guidelines (by karyotype 
and/or fluorescence in situ hybridization [FISH]). Chromosomal abnormalities and translocations that are routinely assessed for the diagnosis of MDS and AML and are included in the IPSS-R Prognostic Risk Score include, for example, trisomy 8, 
del(5)q, monosomy 7, del(20)(q), +6, +13, +21, t(5;12)(q33;p13), other 12p changes, 
t(3;5)(q25;q34), inv(3)(q21q26), rearrangements involving 1q, 11q23, 17p-/-17 and X chromosome.
The bone marrow pathology reports, cytogenetics reports,  
from the local laboratories will be submitted to the sponsor.
In addition to submitting bone marrow samples to the local laboratory (as per institutional 
guidelines), the samples should be submitted to the central laboratory, as follows:
!Whenever a bone marrow aspirate is collected, 2 to 3 unstained aspirate smears 
(either uncharged or charged slides) should be submitted to the central laboratory.CCI

laboratory.
Acceptable bone marrow biopsy samples in order of preference are as follows:
1. 5 unstained slides (charged slides) from core biopsy specimen 3 to 5 microns thick.
2. Formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissue block.
3. Core biopsy in formalin-filled container.
These bone marrow samples that are being sent to the central laboratory are for:
!Quality control evaluation of blast coun t assessments: Bone marrow samples will 
also be sent to a central laboratory, in addition to those sent for local laboratory 
examination, for evaluation of blast count. The procedure for handling, preparation 
and shipment of samples is outlined in the Study Manual. Samples will be evaluated 
by the central laboratory at each time point (including any unscheduled samples) and results will be reported to the sponsor. This evaluation will not be a real-time confirmation of progression, and results will not be routinely available to the clinical 
sites. Clinical decisions will be based on local laboratory blast count results. 
Discrepancies between local study site resu lts and central laboratory results will be 
reviewed by the sponsor. 
Following Cycle 4, bone marrow collection will be performed only as clinically indicated in 
patients who achieve CR. In all other patients who do not achieve CR, bone marrow 
assessments will be performed after completion of every third treatment cycle. Additional bone marrow aspirates may be performed if warranted by changes in peripheral blood counts.
Details regarding the preparation, handling, and shipping of these samples are provided in 
the Laboratory Manual.

7.4.21 Disease Assessment 
Formal disease assessments for study endpoints will be determined based on local bone 
marrow aspirate blast counts and transfusions, and central lab data (local lab data may be 
used for time-sensitive clinical decisions). The investigator’s assessment of disease status 
will be entered into the eCRF for each time point.
Transformation to AML may occur in both MDS and CMML. In this study, transformation 
to AML is defined, according to WHO Classification [72] as a patient having >20% blasts in 
the blood or marrow AND increase of blast count by 50%. To illustrate: 
!For patients with 5% to 10% blasts pr etreatment: a >50% increase to >10% blasts 
constitutes progression of MDS.
!For patients with 10% to 20% blasts pretreatment: a >50% in crease to >20% blasts 
constitutes transformation to AML.CCI

86Note: The principal invest igator should make all efforts to perform the disease assessment 
by a bone marrow examinat ion. 
However, in the except ional circumstance that it is not 
possible to have a bone marrow examinat ionfrom patients f or disease assessment , 
transformation to AML will also be defined as >20% bl asts in peripheral blood AND an 
increase of blast count by  50% from  pretreatm ent.
Note that, according to the WHO Classificat ion [72]:
The blast percentage and assessment of degree of maturation and dysplast ic 
abnorm alities in the neopl astic cells should be determined, if possible, fro m a 
200-cell leukocy te different ial perform ed on a peripheral blood smear and a 500 -cell 
different ial perform ed on m arrow aspi rate sm ears stained wi th Wright Gi emsa or 
May-Grunwald Giemsa. The blast percentage should be correla ted wi th an est imate 
of the blast count from the marrow biopsy  secti on. In addi tion to myel oblasts, the 
monoblasts and promonocy tes in acute m onoblast ic/monocyt ic and acute and chronic 
myelo monocy tic leukemia and the megakary oblasts in acute m egakary oblast ic 
leukemia are considered as ‘blast equivalents’ when the requisite percentage of blasts 
is calculated for the diagnosis of AML.
As defined in
 Table 7.dand  Table 7.e, addi tional assessment(s) of disease response for 
patients wi th MDS or CMML are based on the criteria outlined in the Modified IWG 
Response Criteria for MDS [3]; and additional assessments of disease response for pati ents 
with low-blast AML are based on the criteria outlined in the Revised Reco mmendat ions of 
the IW G for Di agnosis Standardizat ion of Response Criteria, Treatment Outcomes, and 
Reporting Standards for Therapeutic Trials in Acute My eloid Leukemia (Table 7.f.).
Note that standard MDS guidelines [33] also recommend treatment for 6 cy cles wi thout 
altering dose or frequency of azacit idine regardless of cy topenias. Therefore, in this study , 
patients wi th HR MDS or CMML may  be allowed to con tinue study  treatm ent (ei ther 
treatm ent arm ), even if they  meet the cri teria for progressive disease based only on bone 
marrow bl ast counts (wi thout AML transformat ion), if, in the clinical judgment of the 
investigator, the patient is st ill receiving clinical benefit from this treatment, and the 
continuat ion is endorsed by the sponsor’s pro ject clinician (or designee). Patients who m eet 
the criteria for PD and conti nue on study  under these condit ions must be reconsented before 
continuing study  treatm ent.
Invest igators should note that some AML patients may benefit fro m continued treatment 
even though their bone marrow blast counts may fluctuate over the course of the first

874cycles. For example, 2 of the 6 responders in the single -agent pevonedistat study  in 
relapsed/re fractory AML had asymptomat ic transient increases in bone marrow blasts after 
achieving a response. In these 2 cases, bone marrow blasts increased from less than 5% to 
more than 20%, and then declined. In addi tion, another responder in that study  had an 
asymptomat ic transient increase in bone marrow blasts before achieving a response. In that 
case, bone marrow blasts almost doubled before response. These 3 patients were allowed to 
remain on study  because thei r invest igators felt they were clinically benefit ing from 
continued treatment despite changes in their bone marrow blast counts. Therefore ,patients 
with low-blast AML, in this study , also may  be allowed to continue study  treatment (ei ther 
treatm ent arm ), even if they  meet the cri teria for progressive di sease based only on bone 
marrow bl ast counts, if, in the clinical judgment of the investigator, the patient is still 
receiving clini cal benefi t from this treatm ent and the cont inuat ion is endorsed by the 
sponsor’s project clinician (or designee). Patients who meet the criteria for PD and continue 
on study  under these condit ions must be reconsented before continuing study  treatm ent. If a 
patient has <50% increase in blast count from pretreatment, then this is stable disease and 
the pati ent shoul d remain on s tudy.
A minimum of 6 cycles of treatment is strongly encouraged . In the event that early 
remov alfrom the study is being considered for toxicity or stable disease, contact the 
sponsor's project clinician (or designee) to discuss before the patient isremov ed from 
the study.

Category Response Criteria
Morphologic 
Complete Remission 
(CR)A CR designation requires that the patient achieve the morphologic leukemia-free state 
and have an ANC of more than 1,000/ μL and platelets of ≥ 100,000/μL. A 
morphologic leukemia-free state requires less than 5% blasts in an aspirate sample 
with marrow spicules and with a count of at least 200 nucleated cells. Hemoglobin 
concentration or hematocrit has no bearing on remission status, although the patient must be independent of transfusions. There should be no residual evidence of 
extramedullary leukemia.
Morphologic 
Complete Remission with Incomplete Blood Count Recovery (CRi)After chemotherapy, some patients fulfill all of the criteria for CR except for residual

Category Response Criteria
Partial Remission 
(PR)This designation requires all of the hematologic values for a CR but with a decrease of 
at least 50% in the percentage of blasts to 5% to 25% in the bone marrow aspirate . 
Thus, if the pretreatment bone marrow blast percentage was 50% to 100%, the 
percentage of blasts must decrease to a value between 5% and 25%; if the pretreatment 
blast percentage was 20% to less than 49%, they must decrease by at least half to a 
value of more than 5% . A repeat bone marrow aspiration after several weeks may be 
required to distinguish between a PR and increased blasts caused by bone marrow 
regeneratio n. A value of ≤ 5% blasts may also be considered a PR if Auer rods are 
present.
Progressive disease 
(PD)Because the IWG criteria for AML do not provide a standardized definition for PD, [4]
in this protocol, PD is defined as one of the following:
>50% increase in bone marrow blasts from baseline value to > 30% blasts
>50% increase in circulat ing blasts from baseline value to >30% blast sin 
peripheral blood (in the exceptional case when bone marrow examination is 
not possible ) 
Development of biopsy -proven extramedullary disease, or new sites of 
extramedullary leukemia
Relapse after CR Relapse after CR is defined as a reappearance of leukemic blasts in the peripheral 
blood or >5% blasts in the bone marrow not attributable to any other cause (eg, bone 
marrow regeneration after consolidation therapy). In the setting of recent treatment, if 
there are no circulating blasts and the bone marrow contains 5% to 20% blasts, a 
repeat bone marrow performed at least a week later is necessary to distinguish relapse 
from bone marrow regeneration.

917.5 Completion of Treatment
A pat ient has completed the treatment if they discont inue treatment for any o f the reasons 
listed in Section 7.7. Note that PD includes transfo rmation to AML , relapse after CR for 
patients wi th low-blast AML, or other PD as defined in Section 7.4.21 .
As detailed in Sect ion 1.3, som e pati ents in Study  C15003 (single -agent pevonedistat in 
patients wi th relapsed/refractory  AML) derived clinical benefit from cont inuing study 
treatm ent despi te changes in their bone marrow blast counts. Standard MDS guidelines [36]
also recommend treatment for 6 cy cles without al tering dose or frequency of azacit idine 
regardl ess of cy topenias. Therefore, in this study, patients may be allowed to continue 
study treatment (either treatment arm), even if they meet the criteria for PD based 
only on bone marrow blast counts (without AML transformation), if, in the clinical 
judgment of the investigator, the patien t is still receiving clinical benefit from this 
treatment, and the continuation is endorsed by the sponsor’s project clinician (or 
designee). If a patient has <50% increase in blast count from pretreatment, then this is 
stable disease and the patient shoul d remain on study. If a patient has ≥50% increase 
in blast count from pretreatment (without AML transformation) ,but is still deriving 
benefit, the patient may continue on study as agreed by the investigator and the 
sponsor’s project clinician (or designee ). Patients who meet the criteria for PD and 
continue on study under these conditions must be reconsented before continuing study 
treatment.
A minimum of 6 cycles of treatment is strongly encouraged. In the event that early 
removal from the study is being considered for toxicity or stable disease, contact the 
sponsor's project clinician (or designee) to discuss before the patient isremoved from 
the study .
Patients will  attend an EOT vi sit 30 days (+10 days) after the last dose of study  drug or 
before the s tart of subsequent antineoplast ic therapy if that occurs sooner; r efer to the 
Schedule of Events for EOT vi sit assessments. All pati ents will  then cont inue to be fo llowed 
as specified in the
 Schedule of Events : 
Patients who have not transformed to AML (for patients with HR MDS or CMML at 
study  entry ) or who have not progressed (patients with low -blast AML at study  
entry ) at the time of the EOT visit will enter EFS Follow -up. If a patient with HR 
MDS or CMML at study  entry  subsequent ly transforms to AML (as defined in

7.11 Posttrial Access
7.11.1 Postt rial Access
If an open -label, roll over, posttri al access ( PTA )study  shoul d becom e an opti on and the 
investigator and the sponsor agree that a patient would derive benefit from cont inued 
treatm ent or woul d be harm ed wi thout continued access to the medicat ion, the pati ent m ay 
be given the opportunit y to enroll. The pa tient would then be able to continue receive 
pevonedistat (if rando mized to the combinat ion arm).
7.11.2 Duration of PTA
In the event of a rollo ver PTA study , continued access to pevonedistat for participants will 
be terminated for those individuals who no longe r benefi t from treatm ent (eg, thei r disease 
has progressed or treatment is no longer tolerable), the benefit -risk no longer favors the 
individual, an appropriate alternative therapy becomes available, or pevonedistat becomes 
available eit her commercially o r via another access mechanism. PTA may  be terminated in a 
country  or geographical regio n where the development of pevonedistat has been suspended 
or stopped by  the sponsor, or pevonedistat can no longer be supplied.

combinat ion of pevonedistat and azacit idine or single -agent azaci tidine.
8.1.2 Randomization and Stratification
Patients will  be randomized to receive the combination of pevonedistat and azacit idine or 
azacit idine alo ne in a 1:1 ratio, stratified into 4 categories: low -blast AML, IPSS -R risk 
groups of very  high, high, or intermediate for MDS/CMML [2]. (Note that patients with 
indeterminate cy togenet ics findings at Screening should be assigned a cytogenet ics 
prognosti c vari able of  2 points, i e, intermediate, for determining overall Prognostic Risk 
Category /Score; see Sect ion
 7.4.4 ).
8.1.3    Populations for Analysis
The populat ions used for analysis will include the fo llowing:
Safety popul ation: The safet y populati on is defined as all pat ients who receive at 
least 1 dose of pevonedistat plus azacit idine or azaci tidine al one. Pati ents will be 
analyzed according to the actual treatment they received. Patients who received any  
dose of pevonedistat will be included in the Combinat ion Pevonedistat Plus 
Azacit idine Arm, and patients who did not receive any dose of pevonedistat ,but
received at least 1 dose of azacit idine ,will be included in the Single -Agent 
Azacit idine Arm, regardless of their rando mized treatment.
Intent -to-treat (ITT) population: The I TT populat ion is defined as all patients who 
are randomized. Patients in this populat ion will  be analyzed according to the 
treatm ent they  were randomized to receive, regardless of any  dosing errors.

patients who receive at least 1 dose of study  drug, have a disease assessment at
Baseline, and at least 1 postbaseline disease assessment.
8.1.4 Procedures for Handling Missing, Unused, and Spurious Data
All available efficacy and safet y data will be included in data list ings and tabulations. The 
relevance o f missing sample data will be assessed.
Data that are potentially  spuri ous or erroneous will be examined according to standard data 
management operating procedures. Details on any sensi tivity analyses and data handling 
details regarding issues such as missing data will be discussed in the SAP.
8.1.5 Demographic and Baseline Characteristics

gender, age, race, weight, height, and other parameters as appropriate. No inferential 
statist ics will be carried out.
Throughout this study , baseline assessments are defined as those performed at the closest 
time before the start of study  drug administrati on.
8.1.6 Efficacy Analysis
8.1.6.1 General Methodology
Summary  tabulat ions will be presented by treatment group and will display the number of 
observat ions, m ean, standard deviat ion, median, minimum, and maximum for continuous 
variables, and the number and percent per category for categorical data. The Kaplan -Meier 
survival curves and Kaplan -Meier m edians (if estimable) will also be provided, along with 
their 2-sided 95% CIs for time to event data.
All efficacy primary analyses will be based on investigator assessments. Any sensit ivity 
analysis will be specifie d in the SAP.

Clinical Study Protocol Pevonedistat -2001 Amendment 0 4, Eu draCT : 2015 -000221-37
97OS will be analyzed when approximately 60% of patients with HR MDS/CMML have 
experienced OS events, or terminat ion of the study by the sponsor.
OS will be calculated fro m date of rando mizat ion to the date of patient death due to any 
cause. Patients without documented death at the time of the analysis will be censored at the 
date tha t the patie nt was last known to be alive. Unstratified log -rank test will be used to 
compare OS between the 2 treatment arms. Hazard ratios, along with the 2 -sided 95% CIs,
will be estimated using the unadjusted, unstratified Cox model. The proportional ha zard 
assumpt ions will be examined and sensit ivity analysis will be conducted if appropriate. 
Kaplan -Meier curves and Kaplan -Meier m edians (if est imable), together with the 95% CIs, 
will be calculated for each treatment group.
8.1.6.3 Analyses of Secondary Efficacy Endpoints
If the secondary efficacy endpo int is response related, such as CR, the response -evaluable 
popul ation ofpatients with HR MDS/CMML, patients with low-blast AML, and the overall 
patientpopul ationwill be used separately ,if appropriate. Duration of the response -related 
endpo intwill be analyzed based on the corresponding responders ; otherwise ,the analysis 
will be based on HR MDS/CMML patients and the ITT populat ion separately.
For pati ents wi th low-blast AML, composite CR + CRi, CR as we ll as CRi will be analyzed.
Refer to Section
 7.4.21 for response definit ions (eg, complete remissio n, transformation to 
AML, PD).
EFS
The analysis of EFS, will  be based on patients wi th HR MDS/CMML and the ITT 
popul ation separately.
For pati ents wi th HR MDS/CMML, an event is defined as death or transformat ion to AML; 
for pati ents wi th low-blast AML, an event is defined as death. EFS is defined as the time 
from randomization to the occurrence of an event. Unstratified log -rank test will be used to 
compare EFS between the 2 arms. The hazard ratios along with the 2 -sided 95% CIs will be 
estimated using the unadjusted, unstratified Cox model. The proporti onal hazard 
assumpt ions will be examined and sensit ivity analysis will be conducted if appropriate. The 
Kaplan -Meier survival curves and Kaplan Meier medians (if estimable), along wit h the 95% 
CIs, will also be provided for each treatment group.

are on study  for 60 days or do not survive 60 days. This safet y evaluat ion,together with 
other safet y and efficacy  data , will be reviewed by the independent data monitoring 
committee (IDMC) that will make recommendat ions regarding whether the study  shoul d 
continue as planne d or di scont inue based on the overall data. The IDMC will review the 
overall pro file and if it is deemed unacceptable, the study  will stop. Otherwise, enrollment 
andstudy  procedures will cont inue as planned during this IA .
The second IA is for evaluat ion of both efficacy and safet y data when approximately  23EFS 
events have occurred. The IDMC will review the overall data and if it is deemed 
unacceptable, the study  will stop. Otherwise, enrollment and study  procedures will cont inue 
as planned.

10. ADVERSE EVENTS
10.1 Definitions
10.1.1 Pretreatment Event Definition
A pretreatment event is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or subject who has 
signed inform ed consent to participate in a study  but before administration of any study  
medicat ion; it does not necessarily have to have a causal relat ionship with study  
participat ion.
10.1.2 Adverse Event Definition
Adverse event (AE) means any  untoward medical occurrence in a patient or subject 
administered a pharmaceutical product; the untoward medical occurrence does not 
necessarily have a causal relat ionship wi th this treatm ent. An AE can therefore be any 
unfavora ble and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory  finding), symptom, or 
disease tem porally associ ated wi th the use of a m edicinal (investigational) product whether 
or not i t is related to the medicinal product. This includes any newly occurring eve nt, or a 
previous condit ion that has increased in severit y or frequency since the administration of 
study  drug.
An abnormal laboratory  value will not be assessed as an AE unless that value leads to 
discontinuat ion or del ay in treatm ent, dose m odificati on, therapeuti c intervent ion, or is 
considered by the investigator to be a clinically significant change from Baseline. 
10.1.3 Serious Adverse Event Definition
Serious AE (SAE) m eans any untoward medical occurrence that at any  dose:
Results in death.

Pevonedistat (ML N4924; TAK -924)
Clinical Study Protocol Pevonedistat -2001 Amendment 0 4, Eu draCT : 2015 -000221-37
106Is life-threat ening (refers to an AE in which the patient was at risk of death at the 
time of the event. It does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have 
caused death if it were more severe).
Requi res inpat ienthospitalization or prolongation of an existing hospitalization
(see clarificati onbelow on planned hospitalizat ions).
Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity . (Disabilit y is defined 
as a substant ial disrupt ion of a person’s abilit y to conduct normal life functions).
Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect .
Is a medically important event . This refers to an AE that may  not resul t in death, be 
immediately  life threatening, or require hospitalization, but may be considered 
serious when, based on appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize the patient, 
requi re medical or surgi cal intervent ion to prevent 1 of the outcomes listed above, or 
involves suspected transmissio n via a medicinal product of an infect ious agent. 
Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive 
treatm ent in an emergency  room  or at hom e, blood dyscrasias or convulsio ns that do 
not resul t in inpat ient hospi talizat ion, or the develo pment of drug dependency or 
drug abuse; any  organism, virus, or infect ious parti cle (eg, pri on protein transmitting 
transmissible spongiform encephalopathy), pathoge nic or nonpathogenic, is 
considered an infectious agent. 
In thi s study , intensi ty for each AE, including any  lab abnormalit y, will be determined using 
the NCI CTCAE, Version 4.03, effect ive date 14 June 2010 [68]. Clarificat ion shoul d be 
made between a serious AE (SAE) and an AE that is considere d severe in intensit y (Grade 3 
or 4), because the terms serious and severe are NOT synonymous. The general term severe
is often used to describe the intensit y (severi ty) of a specific event; the event itself, however, 
may be of relat ively minor medical sig nificance (such as a Grade 3 headache). This is NOT 
the sam e as serious , which is based on patient/event outcome or action criteria described 
above, and is usually associated with events that pose a threat to a patient’s life or abilit y to 
funct ion. A seve re AE (Grade 3 or 4) does not necessarily  need to be considered serious. For 
example, a white blood cell count of 1000/mm3to less than 2000 is considered Grade 3 
(severe) but may not be considered serious. Seriousness (not intensit y) serves as a guide for
defining regulatory  reporti ng obligat ions.

10710.2 Procedures for Recording and Reporting Adverse Events and Serious 
Adverse Events
All AEs spontaneously reported by the patient and/or in response to an open question from 
study personnel or revealed by observation, physical examination, or other diagnostic 
procedures will be recorded on the appropriate page of the eCRF (see Section  10.3 for the 
period of observation). Any clinically relevant deterioration in laboratory assessments or other clinical finding is considered an AE. When possible, signs and symptoms indicating a common underlying pathology  should be noted as 1 comprehensive event.
Regardless of causality, SAEs and serious pretreatment events (as defined in Section  10.1)  
must be reported (see Section  10.3 for the period of observation) by the investigator to the 
Millennium Department of Pharmacovigilance or designee (contact information provided below). This should be done by faxing the SAE Form within 24 hours after becoming aware 
of the event. The SAE Form, created specif ically by Millennium, will be provided to each 
clinical study site. A sample of the SAE Form may be found in the Study Manual. Follow-up information on the SAE or serious pretreatment event may be requested by Millennium. SAE report information must be consistent with the data provided on the eCRF.
SAE Reporting Contact Information
Planned hospital admissions or surgical procedures for an illness or disease that existed 
before the patient was enrolled in the trial are not to be considered AEs unless the condition 
deteriorated in an unexpected manner during th e trial (eg, surgery was performed earlier or 
later than planned).
For both serious and nonserious AEs, the investigator must determine both the intensity of 
the event and the relationship of the even t to study drug administration. For serious 
pretreatment events, the investigator must deter mine both the intensity of the event and the 
relationship of the event to study procedures.CCI

108Intensit y for each AE, in cluding any lab abnormality , will  be determined using the 
NCI CTCAE, Version 4.03, effective date 14 June 2010 [68]. The cri teria are provided in 
the Study  Manual .
Relationship to study  drug administration will be determined by the invest igator responding 
yes or no to this question: Is there a reasonable possibilit y that the AE is associ ated wi th the 
study  drug?
10.3 Monitoring of Adverse Events and Period of Observation
AEs, both n onseri ous and seri ous, will  be monitored throughout the study  as fo llows: 
AEs will be reported from the first dose of any study  drug through 30 days after 
administration of the last dose of any study  drug and recorded in the eCRFs.
Serious pretreatm ent ev ents will  be reported to the Millennium Department of 
Pharmacovigilance or designee from the time of the signing of the informed consent 
form (ICF) up to first dose of study  drug, but will not be recorded in the eCRF.
Related and unrelated SAEs will be rep orted to the Millennium Department of 
Pharmacovigilance or designee from the first dose of study  drug through the EOT 
visit, 30 (+10) days after administration of the last dose of study drug, and recorded 
in the eCRF. After this period, only related SAEs m ust be reported to the Millennium 
Departm ent of Pharm acovi gilance or desi gnee. SAEs shoul d be m onitored until  they 
are resolved or are clearly determined to be due to a patient’s stable or chronic 
condi tion or intercurrent illness(es). 
10.4 Procedures for Rep orting Drug Exposure During Pregnancy and Birth Events
If a woman becomes pregnant or suspects that she is pregnant while participating in this 
study , she m ust inform  the invest igator immediately and permanent ly discont inue study  
drug. The sponsor must als o be contacted immediately  by faxing a com pleted Pregnancy  
Form  to the Millennium Department of Pharmacovigilance or designee (see Section 10.2). 
The pregnancy must be fo llowed for the final pregnancy outcome.
If a female partner of a male patient becomes pregnant during the male pat ient’s 
participat ion in this study , the sponsor must also be contacted immediately  by faxing a 
completed Pregnancy  Form to the Millennium Department of Pharmacovigilance or

final pregnancy outcom e.
10.5 Safety Reporting to Investigators, IRBs or IECs, and Regulatory Authorities
The sponsor will be responsible for reporting all suspected unexpected serious adverse 
reacti ons (SUSARs) and any other applicable SAEs to regulatory  authori ties, invest igators, 
and IRBs or IECs, as applicable, in accordance with national regulat ions in the countries 
where the study  is conducted . Rel ative to the first awareness o f the event by /or further 
provi sion to the sponsor or sponsor’s designee, S USARs will be submitted to the regulatory 
authori ties as an expedited reported within 7 calendar day s for fatal and life -threatening 
events and 15 calendar days for other serious events, unless otherwise required by national 
regul ations. The sponsor will a lso prepare an expedited report for other safet y issues where 
these might materially alter the current benefit -risk assessment of an investigat ional 
medicinal product or that would be sufficient to consider changes in the investigational 
medicinal product’ s administration or in the overall conduct of the trial. The invest igational 
site also will  forward a copy  of all expedited reports to his or her IRB or IEC in accordance 
with national regulat ions.
11. ADMINISTRATIVE REQUI REMENTS
11.1 Good Clinical Practice
The study  will be conducted in accordance with the ICH -GCP and the appropriate regulatory  
requi rement(s). The invest igator will be thoroughly familiar with the appropriate use of the 
study  drug as described in the protocol and the IB.
The invest igator is respo nsible for supervising any individual or party  to whom  the 
investigator delegates trial -related duti es and functio ns conducted at the trial site. If the 
investigator/inst itution retains the services of any individual or party  to perform  trial-related 
duties and funct ions, the invest igator/inst itution shoul d ensure that thi s individual or party  is 
qualified to perform those trial -related duti es and funct ions and should implement 
procedures to ensure the integrit y of the tri al-related duti es and funct ions per formed and any 
data generated.
11.2 Data Quality Assurance
The invest igator is required to prepare and maintain adequate and accurate case histories 
designed to record all observations and other data pertinent to the study for each study

110patient. Study  data wi ll be entered into an eCRF by  site personnel  using a secure, validated, 
web-based electronic data capture (EDC) applicat ion. Millennium will have access to all 
data upon entry  in the EDC applicat ion. 
Study  monitors will discuss instances of missing or uni nterpretable data with the 
investigator for resolution. Any changes to study  data will  be made to the eCRF and 
docum ented via an el ectroni c audi t trail  associ ated wi th the affected eCRF.
11.3 Electronic Case Report Form Completion 
Millennium or designee will provide the study  sites wi th secure access to and training on the 
EDC applicat ion, sufficient to permit site personnel to enter or correct information in the 
eCRFs for the patients for whom they are responsible.
eCRFs will be co mpleted for each study  patient. It is the invest igator’s responsibilit y to 
ensure the accuracy , com pleteness, clari ty, and t imeliness of the data reported in the 
patient’s eCRF.
The invest igator, or designated representative, should complete the eCRF as soon as 
possible after in formation is collected.
The invest igator must provide through the EDC applicat ion formal approval of all  the 
inform ation in the eCRFs and changes to the eCRFs to endorse the final submitted data for 
the pati ents for which he or she is responsible. The audi t trail  entry  will show the user’s 
ident ificat ion informat ion and the date and time of the correction.
Millennium, or a designee, will retain the eCRF data and corresponding audit trails. A copy  
of the final archival eCRF in the form of a compact disk or o ther electronic m edia will  be 
placed in the invest igator’s study  file.
11.4 Study Monitoring
Moni toring and audit ing procedures developed or approved by Millennium will be fo llowed 
to com ply wit h GCP guidelines.
All information recorded on the eCRFs for this s tudy must be consistent with the patient’s 
source documentation. During the course of the study , the study  monitor will  make study  
site visi ts to revi ew protocol  com pliance, verify  eCRFs against source documentation, assess 
drug accountabilit y, and ensure that the study  is being conducted according to pertinent

111regul atory  requi rements. The review of medical records will be performed in a manner that 
ensures that patient confident iality is maintained. 
11.5 Ethical Considerations
The study  will be conducted in a ccordance with applicable regulatory  requi rement(s) and 
will adhere to GCP standards. The IRB/IEC will review all appropriate study  docum entati on 
to safeguard the rights, safet y, and well -being o f the pati ents. The study  will be conducted 
only at si tes whe re IRB/IEC approval has been obtained. The protocol, IB, ICF, 
advert isements (if applicable), written informat ion given to the patients (including diary  
cards), safety  updates, annual progress reports, and any  revisi ons to these docum ents will  be 
provi ded to the IRB/IEC by  the invest igator or the sponsor, as allowed by local regulat ions.
11.6 Patient Information and Informed Consent
After the study  has been fully  explained, wri tten inform ed consent will be obtained from 
either the pati ent or his/her guardian or legal representative before study participat ion. The 
method of obtaining and document ing the informed consent and the contents of the consent 
must com ply with the ICH -GCP and all applicable regulatory  requi rements. Patients with 
progressive disease based on bone marrow blasts counts may  be all owed to rem ain on study , 
after di scussio n between the invest igator and project clinician or designee, if it is judged that 
they are deriving clinical benefit from doing so. Patients who meet the criteria for PD and 
continue on study under these condit ions m ust be reconsented before continuing study  
treatm ent.
11.7 Patient Confidentiality
To m aintain patient privacy , all eCRFs, study  drug accountabilit y records, study  reports, and 
communicat ions will ident ify the pat ient byinitials where permitted and/or by the assigned 
patient number. The pati ent’s confident iality will be m aintained and will not be made 
publicly  available to the extent permitted by  the applicable laws and regulat ions.
11.8 Investigator Compliance
The invest igator will  conduct the tri al in com pliance wi th the protocol  provi ded by 
Millennium and given approval/favorable opinio n by the IRB/IEC and the appropriate 
regul atory  authori ty(ies). Modificat ions to the protocol are not to be made without 
agreem ent of  both the invest igator and Millennium. Changes to the protocol will require 
written IRB/IEC approval/favorable opinio n before implementation, except when the

112modificati on is needed to eliminate an immediate hazard or hazards to patients. Millennium, 
or a designe e, will submit all protocol modificat ions to the appropriate regulatory  
authori ty(ies) in accordance with the governing regulat ions.
When immediate deviation fro m the protocol  is requi red to eliminate an immediate hazard 
or hazards to patients, the invest igator will contact Millennium, or a designee, if 
circumstances permit, to discuss the planned course of action. Any departures from the 
protocol  must be docum ented.
11.9 On-site Audits
Regulatory  authori ties, the IEC/IRB, and/or Millennium may request access to all source 
docum ents, eCRFs, and other study  docum entati on for on -site audi t or inspect ion. Di rect 
access to these documents must be guaranteed by the invest igator, who must provide support 
at all t imes for these activit ies.
11.10 Investigator and Site Respo nsibility for Drug Accountability
Accountabilit y for the study  drug at the tri al site is the responsibilit y of the invest igator. 
Drug accountabilit y records indicating the drug’s delivery  date to the si te, inventory  at the 
site, use by  each pati ent, and am ount returned to Millennium, or a designee (or disposal o f 
the drug, if approved by Millennium) will be maint ained by  the clinical  site. Millennium  or 
its designee will review drug accountabilit y at the site on an ongoing basis.
All materi al containing stu dy drug will be treated and disposed of in accordance wit h 
governing regulat ions.
11.11 Product Complaints

label instructions pending further guidance from a Millennium Quality representative.
Product complaints in and of themselves are not AEs. If a product complaint results in an 
SAE, an SAE form should be completed and sent to  (refer to Section  10.2) .
11.12 Closure of the Study
Within 90 days of the end of the study, the sponsor will notify the IECs in all member states 
where the study is being carried out that the study has ended, as well as the competent authorities, where required.
Within 1 year of the end of the study, a summary of the clinical trial results will be 
submitted to the competent authorities and IECs in all member states involved in the study.
Study participation by individual sites or the entire study may be prematurely terminated if, 
in the opinion of the investigator or Millenni um, there is sufficient reasonable cause. Written 
notification documenting the reason for study termination will be provided to the 
investigator or Millennium by the terminating party.
Circumstances that may warrant termination include, but are not limited to:
!Determination of unexpected, significant, or unacceptable risk to patients
!Failure to enter patients at an acceptable rate
!Insufficient adherence to protocol requirements
!Insufficient, incomplete, and/or unevaluable data
!Determination of efficacy based on interim analysis
!Plans to modify, suspend or discontinue the development of the study drug
Should the study be closed prematurely, the site will no longer be able to access the EDC 
application, will not have a right to use the EDC application, and will cease using the 
password or access materials once their participation in the study has concluded. In the event 
that any access devices for the EDC application have been provided, these will be returned to Millennium once the site’s participation in the study has concluded.CCI

15.3 Definition of Postmenopausal
A postm enopausal  state is defined as no menses for 12 months without an alternat ive 
medical cause . A high FSH level in the postm enopausal  range may  be used to confirm a 
postm enopausal state in women not using hormonal contraception or hormonal replacement 
therapy . However ,in the absence of 12 months of amenorrhea, a single FSH measurement is 
insufficient. Please refer to the following s ource for addi tional informat ion: European Heads

12315.4 Methods of Contraception Considered to be Effective
Acceptable Methods Considered Highly Effective
Birth control  methods that can achieve a failure rate of less than 1% per year when used 
consistent ly and correctly  are considered as highly  effect ive. Such methods include:
combined (estrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception associated 
with inhibit ion of ovulation1:
oral
intravaginal
transderm al
progestogen -only hormonal contracepti on associ ated wi th inhibit ion of ovulation 1:
oral
injectable
implantable 2
intrauterine device (IUD)2
intrauterine hormone -releasing system  (IUS)2
bilateral  tubal  occl usion2
vasectomised partner2,3
sexual abst inence 4
Methods that are Considered Less Highly Effective
Acceptable birth control methods that result in a failure rate of more than 1% per y ear 
include:
progestogen -only oral hormonal contracepti on, where inhibit ion of ovulation is not 
the primary  mode of  action
male or female condom wit h or without spermicide5

1)Hormonal contraception may be susceptible to interaction with the investigational medicinal product, 
which may reduce the efficacy of the contraception method.
2)Contraception methods that in the context of this guidance are consider ed to have low user 
dependency.
3)Vasectomised partner is a highly effective birth control method provided that partner is the sole sexual 
partner of the woman of childbearing potential participant of the study and that the vasectomised 
partner has received medical assessment of the surgical success.
4)In the context of this guidance sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if 
defined as refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the 
study tre atments. The reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the duration 
of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject.
5)A combination of male condom with either cap, diaphragm or sponge with spermicide (d ouble -barrier 
methods) are also considered acceptable, but not highly effective, birth control methods.

12815.10 Amendment 01 Rationale and Purposes
Rationale for Amend ment 01
The ori ginal  protocol  received approval signatory  on 25 February  2015. Based on the need 
to clarify  information, m odificat ions and/or revisio ns to the text were required. The study
has not enrolled any patients.
The rati onale for including low -marrow bl ast count (20% -30%) World Heal th Organizat ion
(WHO) -defined acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) is based on the fact that it had been 
previously classified as refractory  anemia wi th excess blasts in transformat ion (RAEB -t), 
which was part of the myelodys plasti c syndrom es(MDS) spectrum, and that it is often 
treated with azacit idine-based therapy . In a phase 3 randomized trial, azacit idine 
significant ly pro longed overall survival co mpared with convent ional care regimens in 
patients wi th higher -risk MDS. In that trial, in a subgroup analysis of the 113 elderly  
patients previ ously classified as RAEB -t (now re -classified as low marrow blast AML), 
azacit idine significant ly pro longed survival and was associated with fewer total days in the 
hospi tal than convent ional care regimens.
The rati onale for simplifying the schedule of events is based on the review of informat ion 
presented in the last Development Safety  Update Report (DSUR) (cumulative to 22 January 
2015) where there was no change to the benefit -risk evaluat ion for pevonedistat. The 
sponsor also conducted preliminary analyses (data available as of 19 July 2015) of select 
safet y parameters, including gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), urinalyses (including 
urobilinogen), and vital signs (including systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, 
and heart rate), and no safet y concerns were identified.
The rati onale for inst ituting the 4 -month requirement for female contraception after the last 
dose of study  drug in wo men of childbearing potential is prima rily because so me may 
experience lo nger than the average 28 -day menstrual  cycle, and the extensio n to 4 months 
woul d adequately  and safely  cover these pat ients. In addit ion, pevonedistat is a first -in-class 
molecule warrant ing a more cautious approach, and the 4-month requirement for females 
matches the contraception recommendation for males. 
The rati onale for rem oving the Qualit y of Life in Hem atological Pat ients (myelodysplast ic 
syndro mes) (QOL -E) assessment at study  centers outsi de the Uni ted States (US ) is because 
validated translat ions of the quest ionnaire are not available for all countries in which the 
sponsor intends to enroll patients.

13215.11 Amendment 02 Rationale and Purposes
Rationale for Amendment 02
This protocol was revised to comply with requests rece ived by regulatory  agencies and the 
investigat ive sites. To mit igate reproductive and developmental hazards, addit ional 
pregnancy testing has been added at Day  1 of each Cy cle and at end of treatment (EOT). 
Patients will  also not be allowed to donate ova o r sperm during the study  and f or 4 m onths 
following the last dose of study  drug(s). In addit ion, examples of highly effective birth 
control  methods have been included. 
In thi s study , pati ents wi th higher-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) or chronic 
myelomo nocy tic leukemia (CMML) may  be all owed to continue study  treatm ent if they  
meet the criteria for progressive disease (PD) based only on bone marrow blast count 
(without transformat ion to acute myelogenous leukemia [AML]) if, in the clinical judgment 
ofthe invest igator, the patient is st ill receiving clinical benefit from this treatment, and the 
continuat ion is endorsed by the sponsor’s project clinician (or designee). Patients with 
low-blast AML may also be allowed to continue study  treatm ent even if t hey meet the 
criteria for PD based only on bone marrow blast counts if, in the clinical judgment of the 
investigator, the patient is st ill receiving clinical benefit from this treatment, and the 
continuat ion is endorsed by the sponsor’s project clinician ( or desi gnee). Pati ents wi th PD 
who continue on study  at the invest igator’s discretion should be reconsented before 
continuing study  treatm ent.
The rati onale to allow pat ients with therapy -related MDS, CMML, or low -blast AML 
associ ated wi th previ ous cy totox ic chemotherapy to be included in the study is based on the 
fact that patients with therapy -related MDS or AML have an equivalent outcome to certain 
patients wi th de novo disease. This is because cytogenet ics has an important impact on the 
prognosi s of patients with AML or MDS and i s the strongest prognostic factor for overall 
survival. In patients with de novo MDS with similar adverse cytogenet ics, survival is 
comparable to pati ents wi th therapy -related MDS.

13615.12 Amendment 03 Rationale and Purposes
Rationale for Amendment 03
This document describes the changes in reference to the protocol incorporating 
Amendment 03. The primary reason for this amendm ent is to em ploy a defini tion of 
event -free survival (EFS) that is consistent with the global registration 
Study Pevonedistat -3001 and provide a more clearly defined clinical endpoint for patients 
with low-blast acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). This change will facilitate integration 
of this supportive study  with the gl obal registrati on study  resul ts. This change in EFS 
definit ion affects the primary  object ive and primary endpo int of the study . For pati ents wi th 
low-blast AML, progressive disease or relapse after complete remissio n (CR) has been 
removed from  the definit ion of an event and an event in pat ients with low-blast AML is now 
defined only as death.
Changes in Amendment 03
1.Realign the analysis o f the primary object ive and endpo int as related to the change in the
definit ion of an event for pati ents wi th low-blast AML.
2.Specify  the change in the follow -up process for patients with low -blast AML.
3.Specify  the tri gger init iating the timing of the overall survival final analysis and other
factor(s) that might affect the duration of the study.
4.Specify  the changes used for determinat ion of sample size.
5.Specify  the timing of the second interim analysis to a specific number of events.
6. C larify that Kaplan -Meier est imates and CIs of 6 -month and 1 -year survival rates will be
provi ded based on the intent- to-treat populat ion.
7.Append “relapse from CR” to Study  Overview Di agram  2 for pati ents wi th AML.
8.Update the invest igator responsibilit ies for com pliance wi th updated Internati onal
Council for Harmonisat ion gui delines.

The primary  secti on(s) of the protocol affected by the changes in Amendment
04are 
indicated. The correspond

Change 1: Update the pharmacokinet icprofile of pevonedistat and risk assessment for 
drug- d rug interacti ons.
The primary  change occurs in Secti on 1.4.1 Nonclinical Pharmacokinetics and Risk 
Assessment for Drug- Drug Interactions
Initial 
wording:In vitro pevonedistat is metabo lized via hydroxylatio n and oxidat ion, 
predominant ly by CYP3A4 with a small contribut ion fro m CYP2D6.
Preliminary PK evaluat ions from 26 patients wi th advanced soli d tum ors 
in an ongoing open -label drug -drug interaction (DDI) study  (Study  
C15011) showed that steady -state fl uconazol e (classified as a m oderate 
CYP3A inhibitor) appeared to have minimal effect (13% increased area 
under the plasma concentration versus t ime curve from zero to infinit y 
[AUC inf] on average) on the single IV PK of pevonedistat, while 
systemic exposure of pevonedistat appeared to increase by  23% on 
average in the presence of itraconazole (classified as a stron g CYP3A 
[and P -gp] inhibitor). On the basis of these findings, administration of 
pevonedistat with strong CYP3A inhibitors or inducers should be 
avoided.

If an open -label, rollover, posttrial access ( PTA )study should 
become an option and the investigator and the sponsor agree that a 
patient would derive benefit from continued treatment or would be 
harmed without continued access to the medication, the pati ent may 
be given the opportunity to enroll. The patient would then be able to 
continue receive pevonedistat (if randomized to the combination 
arm).

progressed or treatment is no longer tolerable), the benefit- risk n o 
longer favors the individual, an appropriate alternative therapy 
becomes available, or pevonedistat becomes available either 
commercially or via another access mechanism. PTA may be 
terminated in a country or geographical region where the 
development of pevonedistat has been suspended or stopped by the 
sponsor, or pevonedistat can no longer be supplied.
Rationale for Change: Text added for informat ion on program -level PTA for

wording:Assuming an exponent ial distribut ion for EFS, a total of approximately 
60 EFS events will be required to detect a hazard ratio of 0.585 (median 
EFS of 22.2 months in the Co mbinat ion Pevonedistat Plus Azacit idine 
Arm versus 13 m onths in the Single -Agent Azacit idine Arm) with 
approximately  85% power using a 1 -sided l og-rank test at a 15% overall

1:1 rati o to receive eit her the combination o f pevon edistat and azacit idine 
or single -agent azaci tidine, assuming an enrollment rate that increases 
from an init ial 1 pat ient per m onth to 12 pati ents per m onth after 
7months. Sixt y EFS events are estimated to occur within approximately 
28months from  the enr ollment of the first patient. This est imated period 
includes a 14- month accrual period and an addit ional 14 -month 
follow-up fro m the last pati ent enrolled.

removal ofEFS as the primary endpo int. 
Change 12: Specify analyses of primary efficacy endpo int OS.
Primary change occurs in Sect ion8.1.6.2 Analyses of Primary Efficacy Endpoints
Initial 
wording:The analysis of the primary  efficacy endpoint, EFS, will be based on the 
ITT populat ion.
For pati ents wi th HR MDS/CMML, an event is defined as death or 
transformation to AML; for patients with low -blast AML, an event is 
defined as death. EFS is defined as the time fro m rando mizat ion to the 
occurrence of an event. Stratified log -rank test will be used to compare 
EFS between the 2 arms (see Section 8.1.2 for stratificat ion factors). The 
hazard ratios along wit h the 2- sided 70% CIs and 95% CIs will be 
estimated using the unadjusted strat ified Cox model. The proportional 
hazard assumptions will be examined and sensit ivity analysis will be 
conducted if appropriate. The Kaplan -Meier survival  curves and Kaplan 
Meier m edians (if est imable), along with the 70% and 95% CIs, will also 
be provided for each treatm ent group.
Amended or 
new wording:The analysis of the primary  efficacy endpoint, OSEFS, will be based on 
HR MDS/CMML patients and the ITT population separately.
ForOS will be analyzed when approximately 60% of patients with HR 
MDS/CMML ,an event is defined as death or transformat ion to AML; for 
patients wi th low blast AML, an event is defined as death. EFS is defined
as the time from randomization to the occurrence of an event. Stratified
have experienced OS events, or termination of the study by the 
sponsor .
OS will be calculated from date of randomization to the date of 
patient death due to any cause. Patients without documented death 
at the time of the analysis will be censored at the date that the 
patient was last known to be alive. Unstratified log-rank test will be 
used to com pare OSEFS between the 2 treatment arms (see Section 
8.1.2 for stratificat ion factors). The hazard Hazard ratios ,along wi th the 
2-sided 70% CIs and 95% C Is,will be estimated using the unadjusted ,
stratified unstratified Cox m odel. The proporti onal hazard assumpt ions
will be examined and sensit ivity analysis will be conducted if
appropriate. TheKaplan -Meier survival  curves and Kaplan -Meier
medians (if est imable), alongtogether with the 70% and 95% CIs, will
also be provided calculated for each treatment group.

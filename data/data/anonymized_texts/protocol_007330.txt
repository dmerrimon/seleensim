5 INTRODUCTION  
5.1 Rationale and Background  
T30fA  are a new monthly replacement soft contact len ses, which u tilize water gradient 
technology, and contain 55% water content at the core that gradually increases to nearly 
100% at the outer surface . The lenses also use  biomimetic Celligent Technology , which has 
properties that allow the lens to mimic the corneal surface. The innovative surface chemistry 
provides an extremely soft and lubricious lens surface and helps to resist bacterial and lipid 
deposit adhesion. T30fA  contact lenses also offer UV and blue -violet light (BVL) filtering . 
T30fA  lenses are indicated for the optical correction of refractive ametropia (myopia and 
hyperopia, with astigmatism) in persons with nondiseased  eyes.

Alcon – Business Use Only  5.2 Purpose of the Study  
The purpose of this study is to assess the clinical performance of T30fA contact lenses 
compared to the commercially available Biofinity Toric  soft contact lenses  
 
 
The endpoints have been selected to address the primary objective of the study. Procedures 
for measurement of these endpoints were  selected based on common practice for these 
assessments. The  design of this study is justified  based upon preclinical and clinical testing, 
as described within the package insert . Biofinity Toric  soft contact lenses were chosen as the 
comparator product because these lenses  have the same wear modality and replacement 
schedule.  
The lenses are intended for daily wear (less than 24 hours while awake), with removal for 
cleaning and disinfection (chemical, not heat) prior to reinsertion, or disposal, as 
recommended by the eye care professional. Lenses should be discarded and replaced after 
one month.  
There are no immediate plans to submit the results of this study for publication; however, the 
results may be offered for publication if they are of scientific interest, or if the results relate to 
a product that is subsequently approved or cleared for marketing.   
5.3 Risks and Benefits  
The clinical investigation process risks are managed through appropria te training and 
monitoring according to the protocol -specific monitoring plan . Investigational device risks , 
including risks associated with use of device and methods and procedures for application of 
device , are defined in the investigator ’s brochure and/ or product labeling and are managed 
through review of safety assessments outlined in this protocol.  
T30fA  (lehfilcon A) soft contact lenses  and Biofinity Toric  contact lenses are commercially 
available for daily wear use under a frequent replacement wear modality; further details on 
any known potential risks and benefits can be found in the DFU.  
A summary of the known potential risks and benefits associated with  the T30fA and Biofinity 
Toric  soft contact lenses can be found in the package insert . Any risk to subjects in this 
clinical study will be minimized by compliance with the eligibility criteria and study 
procedures, as well as through close clinical supervis ion by a licensed clinician during

7 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
7.1 Study Design  
This is a prospective, randomized, bilateral crossover, controlled, double -masked, clinical 
study to be conducted at approximately 5 sites. Eligible habitual toric soft contact lens 
wearers will be randomized to 1 of the 2 crossover sequences. Investigator  and subject will 
be masked. A designated unmasked study staff member will prepare the contact lenses for 
dispensing.

V-CLN -0183501  Status: Approved , Version: 3.0 
Approved Date: 15 Dec 2023  Page 29 of 63 
 
Alcon – Business Use Only  Subjects will be exp ected to attend 5 office visits  and will be dispensed study lenses ( per 
randomization sequence ) for 30 -day duration of bilateral  wear with each study lens (~60 days 
of lens wear).  
 
 the 
subject will wear the lenses each day  for at least 12 hours per day .  
At Visit 1 screening /baseline , lens fitting  and randomization  will be performed . Subject will 
return to the office for Visit 2  and Visit 4  after washout period (2-4 days ) and will be 
dispense d their assigned  study lens by an unmasked study staff member .  
At Visit 3 and Visit 5  (Day 30 -1/+3 days)  in-office lens fitting assessment s for study lens es 
will be performed ; once Visit 5 is complete  subjects  will exit from the study.  
7.2 Rationale for Study Design  
The crossover design will ensure that the same subject is exposed to both the test and 
comparator lens materials; therefore, objective assessments  
will be obtaine d for both lenses from the same subject. The study will include only those 
subjects who are current wearers of toric soft contact lenses in both eyes with at least 3 
months wearing experience, with a minimum wearing time of 5 days per week , and at least  
12 hours per day. This will avoid confounding  safety responses in nonadapted 
subjects. Furthermore, the subjects will not be permitted to use lubrication/rewetting drops 
during the duration of the study  
7.3 Rationale for Duration of Treatment/ Follow -up 
The duration of product use is in accordance with product labeling.

Approved Date: 15 Dec 2023  Page 30 of 63 
 
Alcon – Business Use Only  7.4 Rationale for Choice of Comparator  Product  
The Biofinity Toric soft contact lens was chosen as the comparator product as these lenses 
have the same wear modality and replacement  schedule as T30fA .  
8 STUDY POPULATION  
The study population consists of male and female subjects  ages 18 -45 who are habitual toric 
soft contact lens  wearers  who have at least 3 months of contact lens wearing experience 
(excluding any Biofinity Toric habitual lens wearers, Alcon Toric contact lens wearers and 
habitual daily disposable lens wearers)  and who wear their habitual lenses at least 5 days per  
week and at least 12 hours  per day   
 
. To qualify, subjects must be able to wear contact lenses within a range of sphere 
and cylinder power and axes (Sphere: -0.50 D to -6.00 D in 0.25 D steps; Cylinder: -0.75 D 
and -1.25 D; Axis: 10º, 80º, 90º, 100º, 170º, 180º).  
 
It is aimed to enroll  (consent)  approximately 66 subjects in approximately 5 sites in the USA 
with a target of 60 total subjects  completed   
. Site-specific targets 
may vary based upon individual site capabilities . Estimated time needed to recruit subjects 
for the study is approximately 6  weeks; however , unanticipated circumsta nces may shorten or 
lengthen this time and would not require amendment of this protocol. Because a 10% 
screening failure rate is expected, approximately 6 6 subjects are expected to be enrolled .   
8.1 Inclusion Criteria

o Iritis  
o Increase in intraocular pressure  
o Culture positive for microorganisms  
o  Increasing size or severity at subsequent visits  
• Any central or paracentral corneal event (such as neovascularization) that results in 
permanent opacification  
• Hypopyon  
• Hyphema  
• Neovascularization within the central 6 mm of the cornea  
• Permanent vision loss as defined by loss of 2 or more lines of BCV A from Baseline 
Visit that fails to resolve  
• Uveitis (anterior, intermediate, or posterior)  
• Corneal abrasion affecting ≥ 50% of corneal surface area  
NOTE: For cultured events, document available results in  the narrative section(s) of the 
corresponding ADE -SAE eCRF.  
Other Ocular Adverse Events  
The investigator  must also report any ocular AE that is nonserious, device -related, nonsight 
threatening, and warrants discontinuation of any C ontact Lens  wear for greater than or equal 
to 2 weeks. The following are examples of such AEs:  
• Peripheral nonprogressive noninfe ctious ulcers  
• All symptomatic corneal infiltrative events  
• Corneal staining score moderate (dense coalescent staining up to 2 mm) or greater

Standardization (ISO) 11980 and the US FDA Premarket Notification (510(k)) Guidance 
Docume nt for Daily Wear Contact Lenses  and Contact Lens Care . 
Device Deficiencies  
A device deficiency may or may not be associated with subject  harm (i.e., ADE or SADE); 
however, not all ADEs or SADEs are due to a device deficiency. The investigator  should 
determine the applicable category for the identified or suspect device deficiency and report 
any subject  harm separately. Examples of device d eficiencies include the following:  
• Failure to meet product specifications (e.g., incorrect lens power/diameter/base 
curve/color)  
• Lens cloudy  
• Lens surface/edge defect  
• Torn lens during handling/in pack  
• Packaging deficit (e.g., mislabeled product)  
• Suspect pr oduct contamination  
11.2 Monitoring for Adverse Events  
At each visit, after the subject has had the opportunity to spontaneously mention any 
problems, the investigator  should inquire about AEs by asking the standard questions shown 
below and report as applicabl e: 
• “Have you had any health problems since your last study visit?”  
• “Have there been any changes in the medicines you take since your last study visit?”  
In addition, changes in any protocol -specific parameters  evaluated 
during the stud y are to be reviewed by the investigator . Any untoward (unfavorable and 
unintended) change in a protocol -specific parameter  that is 
clinically relevant, in the opinion of the investigator , is to be reported as an AE. These 
clinically relevant changes will be reported regardless of causality.  
11.3 Procedures for Recording and Reporting  
AEs are collected from the time of informed consent . Any preexisting medical conditions or 
signs/symptoms pres ent in a subject prior to the start of the study (i.e., before informed

history section of the eCRF.  
In addition, temporary lens awareness or visual changes during  the fitting process are not 
considered AEs if the investigator  assesses that the symptom(s) can reasonably resolve within 
the anticipated adaptation period.  
For each recorded event, the ADEs and SAEs documentation must include date of 
occurrence, severit y, treatment (if applicable), outcome, and assessments of the seriousness 
and causality. In addition, the investigator  must document all device deficiencies reported or 
observed with test and comparator products on the device deficiency eCRF. The site must  
submit all available information on ADEs, SAEs, and device deficiencies to the study sponsor 
immediately as follows:  
• All SAEs must be reported immediately (within 24 hours) of the investigator ’s or site’s 
awareness .  
• ADEs that do not meet seriousness crit eria and device deficiencies must be reported 
within 10 calendar days of the investigator ’s or site’s awareness .  
• Additional relevant information after initial reporting must be entered into the eCRF as 
soon as the data become available.  
• Document any chang es to concomitant medications on the appropriate eCRFs.  
• Document all relevant information from discharge summary, autopsy report, certificate 
of death, etc., if applicable, in narrative section of the adverse device effect (for related 
AEs) and Serious Adv erse Event  eCRF.  
Note:  Should the EDC system become nonoperational, the site must complete the appropriate 
paper serious adverse event and adverse device effect and/or device deficiency form.  
 
 
 
Study sponsor representatives may be contacted for any protocol -related question and their 
contact information is provided in the manual of procedures that accompanies this protocol.  
Further, depending upon the nature of the AE or device  deficiency being reported, the study 
sponsor may request copies of applicable portions of the subject’s medical records. The 
investigator  must also report all AEs and device deficiencies that could have led to a SADE 
according to the requirements of regul atory authorities or IRB/IEC.

Alcon – Business Use Only  Intensity and Causality Assessments  
Where appropriate, the investigator  must assess the intensity (severity) of the AE based on 
medical judgment with consideration of any subjective symptom(s), as defined below:  
Intensity (Severity)  
Mild  An AE is mild if the subject is aware of but can easily tolerate the sign or 
symptom.  
Moderate  An AE is moderate if the sign or symptom results in discomfort significant 
enough to cause interference with the subject’s usual activities.  
Severe  An AE is severe if the sign or symptom is incapacitating and results in the 
subject’s inability to work or engage in their usual activities.  
For every AE in the study, the investigator  must assess the causality ( related or not related to 
the medical device or study procedure). An assessment of causality will also be performed by 
study sponsor utilizing the same definitions, as shown below:  
Causality  
Related  An AE classified as related may be either definitely related or possibly related 
where a direct cause and effect relationship with the medical device or study 
procedure has not been demonstrated, but there is a reasonable possibility that 
the AE was caused by the medical device or study procedure.  
Not Related  An AE classified as not related may either be definitely unrelated or simply 
unlikely to be related (i.e., there are other more likely causes fo r the AE).  
The study sponsor will assess the AEs and may upgrade the investigator ’s assessment of 
seriousness and/or causality. The study sponsor will notify the investigator  of any AE that is 
upgraded from nonserious to serious or from unrelated to relate d.

Masked information on the i dentity of the assigned medical device should not be disclosed 
during the study. If the treatment code needs to be broken in the interest of subject safety, the 
investigator  is encouraged to contact an appropriate study sponsor representative prior to 
unma sking the information if there is sufficient time. Dependent upon the individual 
circumstances (i.e., medical emergency), the code may be broken prior to contact with the 
study sponsor. The study sponsor must be informed of all cases in which the code was broken 
and of the circumstances involved. Additionally, the study sponsor may be required to 
unmask the information in order to fulfill expedited regulatory reporting requirements.  
11.6 Follow -up of Subjects with Adverse Events  
The investigator  is responsible f or adequate and safe medical care of subjects during the 
study and for ensuring that appropriate medical care and relevant follow -up procedures are 
maintained after the study.  
The investigator  should provide the study sponsor with any new safety informati on (which 
includes new AEs and changes to previously reported AEs) that may affect the safety 
evaluation of the device. For AEs that are unresolved /ongoing at time of subject exit from 
study, any additional information received at follow -up should be docum ented in the eCRFs 
up to study completion (i.e., database lock).  
All complaints received after this time period will be considered and processed as 
spontaneous (following the post market vigilance procedures) and should be communicated 
to the medical devi ce’s manufacturer as per local requirements.  
The investigator  should also report complaints on non -Alcon products (i.e., Biofinity Toric ) 
directly to the manufacturer as per the manufacturer’s instructions or local regulatory 
requirements.

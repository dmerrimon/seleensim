SYNOPSIS  
Name of Investigational Product:   INCB050465 and INCB039110 
Title of Study:   A Phase 1 /2, Open- Label , Dose-Escalation, Safety and Tolerability Study of 
INCB050465 and INCB039110 in Subjects With Previously Treated  B-Cell Malignancies  
Protocol Number:   INCB 50465-101 Study Phase:   1/2 
Primary  Objective : 
• To assess the safety and tolerability of the planned study treatments  and select doses for further 
evaluation. 
Secondary  Objectives:  
• To assess preliminary efficacy by assessing the overall response rate (ORR) of the planned study 
treatments  
• To assess the pharmacokinetics (PK) of planned study treatments and assess the effect of food on the 
PK of INCB050 465 monotherapy 
Overall Study Design:  
The study consists of 4 parts.  Monotherapy dose escalation (Part 1) will determine the maximum 
tolerated dose  (MTD)  and the recommended dose(s) of INCB050465 to be evaluated further.  The 
recommended dose(s) will be defined as dose(s) at least equivalent to the pharmacologically active 
dose (PAD; a dose that produces substantial pharmacologic target inhibition) and  no high er than the 
MTD.    
Combination regimen  dose escalation ( Part 2 ) will evaluate the combination of INCB050465 and 
INCB039110 to determine the recommended dose(s) of the combination.   
Expansion (Part 3), which consists of 5 cohorts, will evaluate the recommended dose(s) of 
INCB050465 as monotherapy and in combination with INCB039110.  The monotherapy 
dose-expansion cohorts will evaluate INCB050465 in subjects with B- cell malignancies, indolent  
lymphoma (eg, follicular and marginal zone lymphoma), dif fuse large B -cell lymphoma (DLBCL) , and 
Hodgkin's  lymphoma (HL).  The combination expansion cohorts will evaluate the chosen combination 
dose of INCB050465 and INCB039110 in subjects with B- cell malignancies.  Note that expansion 
cohorts for INCB050465 monotherapy may explore more than 1 recommended dose and schedule to 
obtain long- term safety data on multiple dose levels and schedules.    
Part 6 will include a safety assessment of INCB050465 in combination with the chemotherapy regimen  
R-ICE (rituximab, if osfamide, carboplatin, and etoposide) in subjects with B -cell malignancies, 
followed by an expansion cohort in DLBCL.   
Timing for the initiation of Part 6 will be determined by the sponsor based on emerging data from 
Parts  1 and 3 of the study. Note, for purposes of consistency and database completion, this will remain 
Part 6 . 
Note:   With Amendment 10, Protocol -required procedures have been reduced for ongoing subjects.

Part 1 – Monotherapy Dose Escalation of INCB050465  
Dose escalation will be conducted w ith a 3 + 3 design, with the exception that the first cohort (dose 
level of 5 mg QD) will be a single subject cohort.  There will be an observation period of 21  days 
before enrol lment of the next cohort and administration of the next dose level .  For each subsequent 
dose level, d ose escalation will be conducted with a 3 + 3 dose titration design.  
• The initial cohort will consist of a single subject  (the cohort may include an additional subject to 
ensure completion of 1 evaluable subject thr ough D ay 21); the initial dose will be 5  mg QD . 
− If a Grade 2 or greater adverse event (AE) is observed, the cohort will be expanded to 3  subjects.  
If the initial cohort is expanded to 3 subjects, the safety assessment will follow the 3  + 3 design .  
Subsequent cohorts will  have increases in the dose of INCB050465 limited to no more than 50%. 
− If a Grade 2 or greater AE is not observed, the dose of INCB050465 will be increased to 10 mg QD 
(or 5 mg twice daily [ BID] depending on PK data) in the subsequent cohort, and dose esca lation 
will be conducted using a 3 + 3 dose titration design.  After the 10 mg QD (or 5 mg BID) dose 
level cohort, subsequent increases in the dose of INCB050465 will be limited to no more than 50%. 
− If the MTD has been exceeded or the PAD has been achieved  in the initial cohort, this cohort may 
be expanded to at least 3 subjects and a lower dose of INCB050465 (eg, 2.5 mg QD) may be 
explored. 
• With the  3 + 3 design , each cohort will enroll a minimum of 3 subjects.  If no dose- limiting toxicities 
(DLTs) are ob served in the initial 3 subjects, the next cohort will begin enrollment.  If 1 DLT is 
observed in the first 3 subjects, 3 additional subjects will be enrolled in the cohort.  If DLTs occur in 
> 1 of the first 3 subjects or the total cohort of 6 subjects, then the MTD will be deemed to have been 
exceeded and the next lower tolerable dose level will be deemed to be the MTD . 
• If the dose increment has been 100% and deemed exceeding the MTD, an  intermediate dose level 
may be explored (eg, from 10 mg QD to 7.5 mg QD) . 
If a dose level is reached that provides a suitable profile of pharmacologic target inhibition before  
reaching the MTD  (PAD) , then this dose may be deemed a recommended dose(s)  and used to move to 
Part 3  monotherapy dose-expansion, as well as  taken t o Part  2 for testing in the combination.  Dose 
escalation of the monotherapy may continue at doses above the PAD until the MTD is reached or dose 
escalation is stopped. 
Part 2 – Dose Escalation With the Combination of INCB050465 and INCB039110 
Dose escalat ion w ill proceed using a 3  + 3 design with a starting dose of INCB050465 approximately  
25% (rounded down to the nearest tablet size combination) below the recommended dose determined 
in Part 1 followed by escalation of INCB050465 in combination with INCB039110 at 300 mg QD.  
Escalation of the dose of INCB050465 will continue in combination with INCB039110 300 mg QD 
until the recommended dose is determined .  If the starting dose of INCB050465 cannot be combined 
safely with INCB039110 300 mg QD, INCB039110 at 200 mg QD will be tested.  If that combination 
is tolerated, escalation of INCB050465 will proceed with  INCB039110 200 mg Q D.  Additional dose 
de-escalation may occur with INCB050 465 if DLTs  occur wit h a causality that can be reasonably 
assigned to INCB050465.  Additional dose escalation or de- escalation of INCB039110 may be 
considered if supported by emerging safety, PK ,  data in this combination. 
Part 3 – Expansion 
Expanded cohorts for both monotherapy and combination therapy will be treated with the selected 
doses of INCB050465 as a single agent, INCB039110 as a single agent, and both agents in 
combination, to further determine safety, tolerability, efficacy, PK,  in this population.  The 
subjects with B-cell malignancies in the INCB050465 mo notherapy expansion cohort (Part 3  
Cohort A) will also be used for an optional evaluation of food effect.  Expansion Cohort s A through  D 
may proceed with recommended dose(s) identified in Part 1 .  Note that expansion cohorts for 
INCB050465 monotherapy may explore more than 1 recommended dose and schedule to obtain 
long- term safety data on multiple dose levels and schedules.

When the recommended dose  for combination therapy has been determined from Part 2, enrollment 
will proceed simultaneously for Expansion Cohort E.  Details regarding the dose expansion cohorts are 
described in the table below.  
If ≥ 5 subjects in the first 15 subjects of any cohort, cumulatively,  (or more than 33% of subjects in 
cohorts larger than 15 subjects ) experience DLTs during Cycle 1, further enrollment to the cohort will 
be stopped, and a lower dose level may be explored.   Based on emerging data, the sponsor may decide 
on the number of subjects with a specific subtype of an indication to be enrolled into each expansion 
cohort (eg, non–germinal center B -cell like  [non-GCB ] or GCB in DLBCL).

Part 6 – Dose Evaluation and Expansion With the Combination of INCB050465 and R- ICE 
Initiation of Part 6 dose evaluation will be dependent on preliminary data from Parts 1 and 3 of the study.  Dose evaluation  would proceed in subjects with DLBCL using a 3 + 3 design with a starting 
dose of INCB050465 approximately 25% (rounded down to the nearest tablet size combination) below 
the recommended dose  determined in Part 1 in combination with the chemotherapy components at the 
following doses in a 21- day cycle for a total of 3 cycles:  
• Rituximab 375 mg/m
2 given on Day 1 and Day 2 of Cycle 1, and on Day 1 of Cycles 2 and 3. 
• Ifosfamide 5000 mg/m2 continuous IV infusion over 24 hours on Day 3  
- Mesna should be added to ifosfamide infusion. 
• Carboplatin area under the curve (AUC) = 5 mg/mL (maximum dose 800 mg) IV infusion on Day 3 
• Etoposide 100 mg/m2 IV on Days 3 to 5. 
If tolerated, the dose of INCB050465 will be escalated to the recommended dose in combination with 
R-ICE.  INCB050465 will be given daily and may be continued until a criterion is met for treatment 
discontinuation.  If the starting dose of INCB050465 cannot be combined safely with R- ICE at  the 
schedule described above, the dose of INCB050465 will be reduced to 25% below the dose first 
administered in combination with R- ICE.  Additional dose de -escalation may occur with INCB050 465 
if DLTs  occur wit h a causality that can be reasonably assigned to INCB050465.  Additional dose 
de-escalation of INCB050465 may be considered if supported by emerging safety, PK,  data in 
this combination.  Following the identification of a tolerable dose of the combination of INCB050465 and R- ICE (a dose less than or equal to the MTD) , expanded Cohort L will be opened to further 
evaluate the safety, efficacy, PK, :

Study Drug , Dosage, and Mode of Administration for INCB050465:    
INCB050465 tablets (2.5 mg and 5 mg  strength s) will be administered without regard to food (except 
on Cycle 2 Day  1 in the  optional monotherapy expansion cohort [Expansion Cohort A] for food effect) 
orally QD or BID as determined by emerging PK  data.  Tablet strength of 20 mg may also be 
used depending on the dose escalation of INCB050465.  For QD administration , if a dose is missed  by 
more than 12 hours, the subject should skip the dose and take the next scheduled dose at the usual time.   
For BID administration , if the morning or evening dose is missed by more than 4 hours, the subject 
should skip that dose and take next scheduled dose at the usual time.   For once-weekly dosing, if the 
dose is missed by more than 2 days, the subject should skip the dose and take the next scheduled dose.  
One cycle will be defined as 21  days of treatment  (eg, 21 continuous days of QD treatment, 21 days of 
once- weekly treatment). 
The initial dose in Part 1 will be 5 mg QD with dose escalation to 10 mg QD (or 5 mg BID depending 
on emerging PK data) if a Gra de 2 or greater AE is not reported.  Subsequent cohort expansion will 
proceed with dose escalation limited to approximately 50% increments in the total daily dose.  If a Grade 2 or greater AE is reported in the initial cohort, it will be expanded to 3 subj ects, and subsequent 
cohort expansion will proceed with dose escalation limited to approximately 50% increments in the total daily dose. 
INCB050465 should be administered in the clinic on days when PK   sampling is 
scheduled . 
The sponsor may impl ement alternat ive dose regimens such as intermediate doses, BID doses, or 
alternat ive formulations, depending on PK,  and safety results. 
Study Drug, Dosage , and Mode of Administration  for INCB039110 : 
INCB039110 tablets (100 mg strength) should be take n on an empty stomach if possible (refrain from 
food consumption during the period 2 hours before and 1 hour after INCB039110 administration) and 
can be administered at the same time as INCB050465 where applicable.   
In Part 2, INCB050465 will be given in combination with INCB039110.  The  starting dose of 
INCB039110 will be 300 mg orally  given  QD ( table t strength 100 mg) and will de -escalate to 200 mg 
QD if 300 mg QD cannot be tolerated in combination with INCB050465.  Subjects may have dose 
reductions of INCB039110 during the course of treatment, based upon safety and laboratory 
assessments; guidelines for dose adjustments and restart are provided in the body of the Protocol . 
INCB039110 should be administered in the clinic on Days  1, 8, and 15 of Cycle 1.  INCB039110 will 
be given after all INCB050465 PK sampling is complete on Day 1. 
The dose of INCB039110 in combination with INCB050465 selected after Part 2 will be administered  
in Part 3 Cohort E. 
All s ubjects receiving INBC050465, either as monotherapy or in combination therapy, must receive 
prophylaxis against Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia from the start of study treatment to  at least 2 to 
6 months after the last dose of study drug. 
Dosage and Mode of Administration for Components of R -ICE Regimen:  
Rituximab, ifosfamide, carboplatin, and etoposide will be administered as open -label commercial 
product to subjects in P art 6 for 3 cycles . 
Rituximab 375 mg/m2 will be given on Day 1 and Day 2 of Cycle 1 and Day 1 of Cycles 2 and 3.  
Ifosfamide will be admin istered via continuous infusion over 24 hours at a dose of 5000 mg/m2 on 
Day 3 of each cycle.  Carboplatin will be administered on Day 3 as a dose of AUC = 5  mg/mL .  
Etoposide 100 mg/m2 will be given IV on Days 3 to 5. 
As an alternate to the Protocol- speci fied dose and dose schedule, R-ICE may be administered 
according to institutional practice with medical monitor approval.

1. INTRODUCTION 
1.1. Background  
Phosphatidylinositol 3- kinases (PI 3 -kinases or PI3Ks) belong to a family of lipid signaling 
kinases that phosphorylate phosphoinositides at the D3 position of the inositol ring 
(Cantley  2002 ).  PI3Ks are divided into 3 classes (Class I, II, and III) according to their structure, 
regulation , and  substrate specificity.  Class I PI3Ks, which include PI3Kα, PI3Kβ, PI3Kγ, and 
PI3Kδ , are dual -specificity lipid and protein kinases that catalyze the phosphorylation of 
phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate, giving rise to phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate 
(PIP3).  PIP3 functions as a second messenger that controls a number of cellular processes, 
including growth, survival, adhesion, and migration.  The recognition that aberrant signal transduction occurs in malignant B-lymphocytes via the PI3K pathways resulting in disease 
progression has led to a focus on agents that modulate these signaling pathways.  
INCB039110 is an inhibitor of the Janus kinase ( JAK) family of protein tyrosine kinases with 
selectivity for JAK1.  Janus kinases play an important role in signal transduction following 
cytokine and growth f actor binding to their receptors.  Aberrant production of cytokines and 
growth factors has been associated with neoplasms, therefore inhibition of this pathway may be 
beneficial in the treatment of these conditions.  
Incyte is proposing to study INCB050465, an inhibitor of PI3Kδ, as monotherapy and in combination with INCB039110 for the treatment of relapsed/refractory diffuse large B- cell 
lymphoma (DLBCL), Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL) , and other lymphoid malignancies , including 
indolent lymphoma.  In addition, INCB050465 will be studied in combination with agents considered as part of the standard of care in this population, including bendamustine, rituximab, and the chemotherapy regimen R- ICE (rituximab, ifosfamide, carboplatin, and etoposide). 
1.1.1. PI3Kδ in Oncology 
The B -cell receptor (BCR) is present on both normal and most malignant B cells.  Engagement 
of the BCR provides important survival signals, and interruption of the B- cell survival signal can 
lead to B -cell death ( Kraus  et al  2004).  Elegant studies performed with siRNA to inhibit BCR 
expression have shown that constitutive signaling by BCR is critical for the survival and proliferation of human B- cell lymphomas ( Gururajan et al 2006).  The primary role of BCR 
signaling in these cells seems to be activation of spleen tyrosine kinase ( Benschop and  Chambier  
1999), which in turn leads to several downstream events that promote cell survival, including activatio n of Bruton's  tyrosine kinase (BTK), PI3K, and protein kinase B ( Akt).  Abe rrant 
activation of PI3Kδ specifically has been associated with increased malignant B- cell 
proliferation and survival.  Although no mutations have been identified in PI3Kδ, it has been shown to be oncogenic in cell culture ( Kang et al 2005 ).  Consistent overexpression of PI3Kδ has 
also been observed in acute myeloblastic leukemia, and inhibitors of PI3Kδ can prevent the 
growth of leukemic cells in vitro .  Phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase δ was also shown to be 
expressed in Hodgkin' s and Reed -Sternberg cells.  Inhibition of PI3Kδ with idelalisib block ed 
phosphorylation of Akt and induced apoptosis in the HL  cell line ( Meadows  et al 2012).   The 
role of the PI3K pathway in BCR signaling is beginning to be clarified for non-Hodgkin's 
CONFIDENTIAL  
Incyte Corporation  Page 23 of 115 
Protocol  INCB 50465- 101 Am 10 Version 10 07 AUG 2019  
lymphoma ( NHL ) subtypes.  It has been shown that the activated B- cell (ABC) subtype of 
DLBCL through chronic active BCR signaling engages PI3K, augmenting anti-apoptotic nuclear 
factor -κB (NF-κB) signaling and survival signals and that inhibition of the PI3K/Akt pathway 
synergizes with NF -κB inhibition in killing ABC DLBCL cell lines in vitro  (Monti et  al 2005).  
BCR signaling has also been shown to activate the PI3K/Akt pathway in Burkitt' s lymp homa and 
in other types of NHL. 
Several PI3Kδ selective inhibitor s, including idelalisib , INCB040093, and duvelisib (formerly 
IPI-145), have been advanced into the clinic for the treatment of hematological malignancies.  
The orally available PI3Kδ selective inhibitor, idelalisib, was shown to specifically inhibit the 
growth of cell lines representative of B -cell malignancies and multiple myeloma in preclinical 
models ( Kahl  et al 2014).  Based on this and other clinical studies, idelalisib was approved by the 
FDA as monotherapy for patients with relapsed follicular lymphoma  and small lymphocytic 
lymphoma and as combination therapy with rituximab for patients with  chronic lymphocytic 
lymphoma.  In addition, the approval of ibrutinib, the BTK inhibitor for the treatment of subjects 
with relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) , demonstrated a 66% overall response 
rate (ORR), with 17% of subjects achieving a complete response (CR).  The median response 
duration was 17.5 months.  Responses to ibrutinib increase with longer time on study treatment 
(Wang  et al 2012).  Ibrutinib and idelalisib have demonstrated a high ORR and durable 
remissio
ns in most subjects with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and many subjects with 
MCL and indolent NHL.  These data suggest the importance of the BCR pathway for survival in these diseases.  
 
1.1.2. JAK
1 Inhibition in Oncology and Lymphoma  
Aberrant activation of JAKs, through production of cytokines and growth factors, has been associated with increased malignant cell proliferation and survival in a number of tumor types.  
Janus kinases activate a number of downstream pathways implicated in the proliferation and 
survival of malignant cells including the signal transducers and activators of transcription 
(STATs ), a family of important latent transcription factors.  In DLBCL, JAK  pathway activation 
occurs through both autocrine and paracrine mechanisms.  In the tumor cells, BCR signaling 
leads to increased interleukin ( IL)-6 and IL-10 production through activation of the NF-κ B 
pathway ( Lam et al 2008 ).  A subset of DLBCLs has been characterized as having high 
expression of STAT3, IL-6, and/or IL-10 and it has been shown that JAK inhibition is cytotoxic in these DLBCL cell lines and synergizes with NF -κB inhibitors.  In addition to JAK/STAT 
pathway activatio n through autocrine pathways, the stromal compartment can also provide a 
source of these cytokines in a paracrine manner ( Hodge et al 2005).  
Of clinical relevance, levels of serum IL -10 and IL-6, which signal through the JAKs, ha ve been 
found to be elevated in subjects  with DLBCL compared with normal controls ( Gupta et al 2012).  
Further, subjects  with high serum IL-10 levels were shown to have a shorter event- free survival 
(Gupta et al 2012).  Within the JAK family of kinases, JAK1 has been shown to cooperate with 
JAK2, JAK3, and tyrosine kinase 2 ( TYK2 ) and to play a dominant role in mediating the 
signaling of a number of inflammatory cytokines including IL-6 and IL-10.

1.1.3. Target ing JAK1 in DLBCL and Rationale for Combining PI3Kδ and JAK 
Inhibition  
 
 
 
 
 
 Phase 1 studies with the 
PI3Kδ i
nhibitor idelalisib  and the PI3Kδ γ inhibitor duvelisib demonstrated no responses in 
DLBCL, although 4 of 10 subjects  treated with duvelisib  showed stable disease ( Flinn  et al
 2014, 
Horowitz  et al 2013).  Similarly, early studies with the JAK 2 inhibitor SB1518 showed 0 out of 
3 responses in relapsed/refractory DLBCL ( Younes et al 2012).  
To test this hypothes is preclinical ly, a panel of DLBCL cell lines was grown in conditions to 
activate the JAK pathway.  These cells lines  were exposed  to the PI3Kδ  inhibitor INCB040093, 
either alone or in combination with a panel of compounds that were shown to selectively inhibit 
JAK1 to examine their  effects on cell proliferation and signaling.  The JAK pathway was not 
constitutively activated when grown in t he ab sence of stromal conditioned media ( SCM ), IL-6, 
or IL -10 as assessed by the levels of phosphorylated STAT3 (pSTAT3), a direct downstream 
target of JAK proteins.  In addition, IL-6 or SCM, which contains predominantly IL- 6, IL -8, and 
G-CSF, failed to a ctivate the pathway in the majority of cell lines.  In contrast, IL -10 activated 
the JAK/STAT pathway in the majority of cell lines tested, consistent with previous reports (Gupta et al 2012).  
To test the effects of IL -10 on cell growth and sensitivity to BCR pathway inhibition, the Pfeiffe r 
cell line was used as a model system of DLBCL.  Pfeiffer cells are of the germinal center B -cell 
like (GCB) subtype of DLBCL, have been shown to express PI3Kδ, are sensitive to PI3Kδ 
inhibitio n, and activate the JAK/STAT pathway in response to multiple cytokines as shown 
above.  Pfeiffer cells were treated for 3 days with various concentrations of a novel, selective inhibitor of the PI3Kδ kinase isoform, INCB040093, in the pre sence or absence o f IL-10 and 
1 µM of a JAK1 inhibitor (INCB047986), and cell growth was measured using an ATP readout.  As shown in Figure 1, the presence of IL -10 shifted the potency of INCB040093 by 
approximately 10-fold (half- maximal inhibitory  concentration [ IC
50] = 0.67 µM, - IL-10; 
IC50 = 6.36 µM, + IL-10).  Addition of the JAK1 inhibitor reversed this effect so that the 
combination was approximately 50-fold more potent.  In this system, the JAK1 inhibitor 
compound alone had no effect (IC 50 > 1 µM ).

Protocol  INCB 50465- 101 Am 10 Version 10 07 AUG 2019  
Figure  1: Synergistic Anti -Proliferative Activity of PI3Kδ and JAK Inhibition 
 
This model also showed that inhibition of PI3Kδ together with JAK signaling led to increased 
apoptosis whereas ne ither agent alone had a significant effect.   
Finally, to assess the effects on downstream signaling pathways, Pfeiffer cells were treated with 
INCB040093 +/- a JAK1 selective inhibitor and then stim ulated with IL -10.  In this model, t he 
combination of both compounds was required to block both pathways. 
Similar effects have been observed in other cell lines, including HBL -1 cells, which are of the 
ABC subtype of DLBCL, and with other JAK1 selective compounds.  In summary, these data demonstrate that the pre sence o
 f IL-10, a cytokine shown to be elevated 
in DLBCL subjects  and to correlate with decreased survival, reduces the potency of a PI3Kδ 
inhibitor to block cell growth.  The addition of a JAK1 inhibitor, although it has no inhibitory 
effect as a single a gent, reverses this effect.  The combination of both inhibitors demonstrates 
marked synergy in blocking cell growth and inducing apoptosis by inhibiting multiple signaling 
pathways.  Consistent with these findings, the early clinical data from studies of monotherapy 
BCR and JAK pathway inhibitors suggest only limited evidence of activity in relapsed /refractory 
DLBCL.   
 
 
Clinic
ally the combination of P I3Kδ inhibition and JAK1 inhibition has been tested in S tudy 
INCB 40093-102.  Preliminary activity has been observed in subjects with NHL and HL  
receiving INCB040093 monotherapy and combination treatment (data on file) . 
1.1.4. Rationale for Combining INCB050465 With the Chemotherapy Regimen R -ICE 
in DLBCL  
The combination chemotherapy regimen ICE (ifosfamide, carboplatin, and etoposide) was 
developed for use in relapsed aggressive NHL  to induce a response while minimizing treatment 
toxicity with the goal of stem cell transplant, which may be a curative treatment.  Kewalramani et al (2004) explored whether adding rituximab to the ICE regimen would improve the CRR and 
therefore improve outcomes from stem cell transplant.  The CRRs  of subjects with DLBCL who 
received R -ICE was 53% , which was an improvement from the 27% CRR historically observed 
(Kewalramani  et al 2004).   The CORAL trial studied the salv age chemotherapy regimens R-ICE 
CONFIDENTIAL  

Incyte Corporation  Page 26 of 115 
Protocol  INCB 50465- 101 Am 10 Version 10 07 AUG 2019  
and R- DHAP .  No diffe rence was seen between these 2 regimens , and the ORR and CRR for the 
R-ICE regimen was 63% and 24%, respectively ( Gisselbrecht  et al 2010 ).  As R -ICE has become 
frequently used as salvage chemotherapy in this population, a dditional research has been 
performed to add noncytotoxic agents.  Lenalidomide was added to R- ICE in a study by Feldman 
et al ( 2014) with promising response rates in DLBCL subjects (60% CRR) after first relapse or 
with primary  refractory disease.  Therefore, there is interest in combining the targeted agent 
INCB050465 with this salvage chemotherapy regimen to hopefully improve response rates seen 
with R -ICE alone and allow more subjects to become eligible for a potentially cura tive stem cell 
transplant. 
1.2. Overview of INCB050465 
Refer to the INCB050465 IB  for current information on INCB050465. 
1.2.1. Pharmacology of INCB050465 
INCB050465 represents a novel, potent, and selective inhibitor of the Class IA PI3K enzymes, 
with selectivity for the delta isoform, which is proposed for development for trea tment of 
hematological malignancies.  Because aberrant activation of PI3Kδ has been associated with 
increased malignant  B-cell proliferation and survival, its inhibition may be therapeutic for the 
treatment of such conditions.  INCB050465 potently inhibits the PI3Kδ kinase (IC
50 = 1.0 ± 0.5 nM), with ~ 20,000-fold selectivity for the other PI3K family members and 
> 300-fold selectivity against a broad panel of 192 other kinases.  INCB050465 also showed no 
significant cross -reactivity (defined as > 50% inhibition of specific binding) when screened 
in vitro at 0.1 and 1.0 μ M against approximately  70 receptors, ion channels, transporters, and 
enzymes.  Moreover, INCB050465 is potent (IC 50 values of ≤ 10 nM) in cell- based assays 
relevant to the pathogenesis of B- cell malignancies, such as PI3K δ-mediated signaling and 
growth of human B- cell lines.  This effect is not due to general cytotoxicity, because 10 μ M 
INCB050465 had no significant effect on the growth of nonlymphoid cell lines.  Compared to inhibition of B- cell proliferation, INCB050465 is similarly potent in blocking helper T- cell 
differentiation but is > 100 times less potent in assays that measure effects on human T- cell and 
natural killer  cell proliferation or monocyte function.  These data suggest that the impact of 
INCB050465 on the human immune system will largely be restricted to B- cell and helper T- cell 
differentiation .  Similar results have been reported with the PI3Kδ inhibitor idelalisib (CAL-101, 
GS-1101) and duvelisib, although INCB050465 is significantly more potent in all of the assays 
examined  (refer to the  INCB050465 IB ), suggesting that it may have more marked effects in the 
clinic due to more significant target inhibition throughout the dosing interval.  In vivo , the effects 
of oral INCB050465 were evaluated in mice in the Pfeiffer human tumor xenograft model of B-cell malignancy.  In the P feiffer model of NHL , INCB050465 administration inhibited PI3Kδ 
signaling and tumor growth as a single agent in a dose-dependent manner. 
In a core battery of safety pharmacology studies, a single oral dose of INCB050465 produced no 
adverse effects on central nervous system or respiratory function in the rat, or cardi ovascular 
function in telemeterized conscious dogs.  The IC
50 for inhibition of human ether -à-go-go-related 
gene potassium current in stably transfected HEK293 cells was 188.0 μ M (Hill 
coefficient  = 1.0), which is > 8000-fold higher than the projected stea dy-state Cmax (0.023 μ M 
unbound) after  a 10 mg human dose.

Incyte Corporation  Page 27 of 115 
Protocol  INCB 50465- 101 Am 10 Version 10 07 AUG 2019  
INCB050465 had no effect on central nervous system  function in rats; the no-observed- effect  
level was 100 mg/kg, the highest dose tested. 
Lower respiratory frequency and/or lower minute volume were observed in rats after  
administration of 30 and 100 mg/kg INCB050465.  These changes were not considered adverse 
based on relatively small magnitude ( ≤ 20% below controls) and short duration of the effects 
(resolve d within 1-3 hours postdose).  The no-obs erved-adverse -effect l evel (NOAEL) for effects 
on respiratory function was 100 mg/kg, the highest dose tested. 
Slightly higher pulse pressure occurred in male dogs after administration of 15 mg/kg 
INCB050465 but was not considered to be adverse based on sm all magnitude (<  10% above 
controls) and short duration (resolved within 6 hou rs postdose).  The NOAEL for effects on  
cardiovascular function in this study was 15 mg/kg, the highest dose tested. 
The NOAELs for respiratory and cardiovascular function are we ll above the intended starting 
dose for this study and the anticipated therapeutic dose in humans.  Therefore, together with the 
planned monitoring of vital signs, the risk to subjects is expected to be low.

1.2.3.2. Potential Risks of PI3Kδ Inhibition Based on Ot her Agents in Class  
Idelalisib was approved by the FDA in July 2014 for treatment of relapsed/refractory follicular 
lymphoma and  relapsed small lymphocytic  lymphoma and for treatment of CLL in combination 
with rituximab.  Severe toxicities seen with the use of this agent include hepatotoxicity (fatal or 
serious occurring in 14%), fatal and/or serious diarrhea or colitis (14%), intestinal perforation,  
Pneumocystis jirovecii  pneumonia ( PJP), and pneumonitis.  Hepatotoxicity, coliti s, and 
pneumonitis have als o been reported in subjects treated with the PI3Kδ- inhibitor INCB040093.  
Subjects will be monitored closely for the development of these conditions and will have

treatment held and dose reduced as appropriate.  A standard PJ P prophylaxis regimen will be 
required for all subjects receiving  INCB050465 (see Section  5.8.2) either as monotherapy or in 
combination. 
Based on experience with idelalisib and INCB040093, hepatotoxicity is a risk with this class of 
agents.   Preclinically, hepato toxicity with INCB050465 was only seen at plasma exposures 
> 65-fold higher than the projected clinical exposure at 10 mg QD.  The pharmacophore of  
INCB050465 is different from both idelalisib and INCB040093, which are similar to each other.  
Other PI3Kδ inhibitors with a different pharmacophore have not shown hepatotoxicity in early 
studies ( Savona et al 2013 ).   
1.2.4. Clinical Summary of INCB050465 
As of 02 SEP 2016, data were available for 46 subjects who received INCB050465 administered 
orally at QD doses  of 5 mg (n = 1), 10 mg (n = 3), 15 mg (n = 3), 20 mg (n = 15), 30 mg 
(n =  20), and 45 mg (n = 4).  The median duration of treatment was 104 days.  Adverse events 
observed in ≥ 20% of subjects were nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, neutropenia, fatigue, hypokalemia, and fever.  No ≥ Grade 3 treatment-related AEs were reported in ≥ 10% of 
subjects.  Serious AEs (SAEs) t hat occurred in ≥ 2 subjects included colitis (n = 3), diarrhea 
(n = 3), and pyrexia, pneumonia, dehydration, exfoliative dermatitis, and hypotension (n = 2 
each).  Eleven of the 46 subjects (24%) discontinued study treatment due to the following AEs:  colitis, diarrhea, pneumonitis, rash, exfoliative dermatitis,  psoriasis, neutropenia, pneumonia, and 
hypercalcemia.  All but 1 of these events occurred after the 9 -week disease assessment.  No liver 
function test abnormalities > Grade 1 were reported while subjects were receiving study treatment.  No dose- limiting toxicities were identified, and the maximum tolerated dose was not 
reached.  
As of 02 SEP 2016, 20 objective responses as reported by investigators were observed at doses ≥ 10 mg QD in 41 evaluable subjects.  Objective responses were observed in 5 subjects with 
DLBCL (n = 14), 6 subjects with  follicular lymphoma ( n = 6), 4 subjects with marginal zone 
lymphoma (n = 4); 3 subjects with mantle cell lymphoma (n  = 4), 1 subject with  Hodgkin 
lymphoma (n  = 8) , and 1 subject with CLL (n = 5).   The objective response rate in evaluable 
subjects with NHL  (n = 28) was 64%.  Among the 18 objective responses observed in subjects 
with NHL, 17 (94%) were observed by the time of the first disease assessment.  
Pharmacokinetics analysis showed the T
max is 0.5 to 1 hour, the terminal half- life is 
approximately 8 to 12 hours, and exposure appeared to be dose-proportional between 5 mg QD 
and 45 mg QD at steady state.  The pharmacodynamic analyses demonstrated robust and 
sustained pathway inhibition at all dose levels tested.  Refer to the INCB050465 IB  for further 
details.  
Food effect was assessed in Part 3 Cohort A.  Alt hough coadministration of INCB050465 with a 
high-fat meal decreased 42% of dose- normalized C max compared with the fasted state, it had mild 
effect on dose-normalized AUC (10% decrease) based on data from 12 subjects.  The geometric mean ratio of AUC (fed vs fasted) and 90% confidence interval (CI) are 0.90 (0.68, 1.18), and 
INCB050465 may be administered  without regard to meals ( refer to the INCB050465 IB ).

1.3. Overvi ew of INCB039110 
INCB039110 is an inhibitor of the JAK family of protein tyrosine kinases with selectivity for 
JAK1.  Refer to the INCB039110 IB for current  information on INCB039110. 
1.3.1. Pharmacology Summary 
INCB039110 represents a novel, potent, and selective inhibitor of the JAK family of protein kinases with selectivity for JAK1.  Because JAKs serve to transduce extracellular signals from a number of cytokines and growth factors that are upregulated and thought to be involved in the 
pathogenesis of cancer cachexia and cancer progression, inhibition of their signaling may be 
therapeutic for the treatment of such conditions.  JAK1 has been shown to cooperate with other JAKs to mediate the signaling of a number of inflammatory cytokines.  INCB039110 potently 
inhibits JAK1 (IC
50 = 3.6 nM at 1 mM adenosine triphosphate concentration), with 22- to 
> 500-fold selectivity for the other JAK family members, JAK2, JAK3, and TYK2.  It does not 
significantly inhibit (< 30% inhibition) a broad panel of approximately 60 other kinases.  
Moreover, INCB039110 is potent (IC 50 values of approximately 10-100 nM) in cytokine-driven 
cell-based assays, such as IL -2–stimulated phosphorylation of JAKs and STATs and IL-2–
induced proliferation of primary human T cells.  INCB039110 also inhibits the growth of the cytokine- dependent cell line INA -6.  This effect is not due to general cytotoxicity.  INCB039110 
potently inhibits the phosphorylation of STAT proteins and the production of proinflammatory 
factors (eg,  IL-17, monocyte chemotactic protein-1) induced by other cytokines, such as IL-23 
and IL -6, with IC
50 values in the range of approximately 30 to 100 nM.  In contrast, 
INCB039110 shows less inhibition in cell-based assays dependent on JAK2 (eg, thrombopoietin or prolactin-stimulated STAT phosphorylation) with IC
50 values of approximately 1 μM or 
greater, suggesting that INCB039110 is JAK2-sparing in cells.  In in vivo  models of 
JAK-dependent malignancy, INCB039110 impedes subcutaneous tumor growth of INA- 6 cells 
expressing wild-type JAKs  when administered by continuous infusion, achieving plasma 
concentrations well below those required to inhibit JAK2. 
INCB039110 did not demonstrate off- target activity nor was it active in a panel of approximately 
60 non- JAK family kinases.  Adverse findings in rat safety pharmacology studies, noted only at 
1000 mg/kg, included a transient decrease in locomotor activity, a slight decrease in body 
temperature, and suppression of respiratory function.  The IC 50 for inhibition of the 
human- ether -a-go-go related gene channel was determined to be 65.3 μM.  In a cardiovascular 
evaluation of INCB039110 in dogs, ≥ 60 mg/kg produced a potentially adverse lowering of arterial pressure, compensatory higher heart rate, and an increase in core body temperature.  The NOAEL for the cardiovascular study was 30 mg/kg for both sexes.  
In summary, pharmacological data obtained in both in vitro  and in vivo  model systems support 
the potential utility of orally administered INCB 039110 in the treatment of cancer and associated 
cachexia.  
1.3.2. Drug Disposition Summary  
The preclinical PK of INCB039110 w as evaluated in rats, dogs , and monkeys.  INCB039110 
exhibits low -to-moderate systemic clearance, a low volume of distribution , and a short terminal 
elimination  half-life.  The oral bioavailability was low in monkeys (< 20%), moderate in dogs 
(43%), and high in rats (82%).  INCB039110 is mainly cleared by metabolism and is a substrate 
CONFIDENTIAL  
Incyte Corporation  Page 32 of 115 
Protocol  INCB 50465- 101 Am 10 Version 10 07 AUG 2019  
of CYP3A4 but does not significantly inhibit the activity of the major CYP enzy mes, suggesting 
that the potential for INCB039110 to cause clinical drug-drug interactions through CYP 
inhibition is low.  
1.3.3. Nonclinical Toxicology Summary  
The toxicologic profile of INCB039110 was characterized in single- and multiple-dose oral 
studies of up to 3 months in duration in rats and dogs. 
 
  Pharmacology- related clinical pathology and anatomical alterations in 
multiple -dose rat studies included a reversible lowering of white blood cell count, primarily 
because of a lower circulating lymphocyte count, and reversible lymphoid depletion in lymphoid tissues and reduction in bone marrow cellularity.   
 
In repeat -dose studies in dogs, gastrointestinal inflammation was determined to be the DLT .  
 
 
 
 
 
 
  Cl
inical and histological evidence of JAK inhibition included 
decrea
sed reticulocyte and/or lymphocyte counts, lymphoid depletion of lymphoid tissues, and/or 
reduction of bone marrow cellularity.  
INCB039110 wa
s not genotoxic in the bacterial mutagenicity assay, the in vitro  chromosome 
aberration assay in human lymphocytes, or the in vivo  micronucleus assay in rats.  
INCB039110 also did not demons trate off -target activity nor was it active in a panel of 
approximately 60 non-JAK family kinases.  Additional information on pharmacology, drug 
disposition, and nonclinical toxicology is available in the INCB039110 IB . 
1.3.4. Clinical Summary of INCB039110 
INCB039110 has been administered as monotherapy in clinical studies to  healthy subjects and 
subjects with rheumatoid arthritis, chronic plaque psoriasis, and myelofibrosis.  INCB039110 is being administer ed in combination with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel to subjects with 
advanced solid tumors in an ongoing study (INCB 39110-116).  INCB039110 has also been 
administered in combination with INCB040093 in subjects with B- cell malignancies.  Additional

INCB039110 is known to affect the immune system ; therefore an  increased incidence of 
infections could occur.  Strict clinical monitoring is indicated to identify and treat infections in 
study subjects should they occur, and a standard PJ P prophylaxis regimen will be required for all

subjects receiving combination treatment with INCB050465 and INCB039110.  R efer to the 
INCB039110 IB  for further details.  
INCB039110 has been shown to affect hematologic parameters.  In a study of INCB039110 in 
subjects with myelofibrosis, anemia , and thrombocytopenia occurred in > 30% of the 87 subjects  
enrolled  (refer to the INCB039110 IB ).  Subjects will have hematologic parameters closely 
monitored during this study. 
Hyperlipidemia has previously been noted in subjects receiving JAK inhibitors ( Kontzias et al 
2012).  Ten subjects ( 18.2%) were o bserved to have an increase in blood cholesterol greater than 
the upper limit of normal (ULN) after receiving combination treatment with INCB040093 and 
INCB039110 while enrolled in the INCB 40093-102 study.  In the oncology population, 
monitoring and treatment of hyperlipidemia should be tailored as appropriate to individual 
subject characteristics, while exercising caution on study with cholesterol -lowering agents such 
as HMG -CoA reductase inhibitors that are associated with liver function abnormalities. 
1.4. Overview of the Combination  of INCB050465 and INCB039110 
1.4.1. Nonclinical Pharmacokinetics and Drug Metabolism of the Combination 
Both INCB0 50465 and INCB039110 are metabolized predominately by CYP3A4, but neither 
appears to be an inducer or inhibitor of CYP3A4 at clinically relevant concentrations.  Also, 
INCB0 50465 is a P -gp inhibitor, while INCB039110 is a weak P-gp inhibitor.  While both 
INCB0 50465 and INCB039110 are P-gp substrates, their efflux transport via P-gp is likely to be 
saturated at the doses proposed for clinical evaluation and thus further inhibition of P-gp should have no effect on INCB050465 or INCB039110 absorption.  Therefore, a drug interaction between these compounds is unlikely in the setting of the proposed clinical study.  
Pharmacokinetics will be evaluated in this study to evaluate potential effect of INCB040093 on 
INCB039110 PK , with evaluation of INCB050465 PK in combination with INCB039110 
compared with INCB0 50465 monotherapy. 
1.4.2. Clinical Summary of Combination Treatment with INCB050465 and 
INCB039110 
As of 02 SEP 2016, 3 subjects had received the INCB050465 and INCB039110 combination 
therapy.  No SAEs were reported for these 3 subjects, and no AEs led to study treatment 
discontinuation.  Non− treatment -related AEs of spinal cord compressio n and pain led to study 
treatment interruption in 1 subject.  Among these 3 subjects, 2 partial responses ( PRs) were 
reported in Hodgkin lymphoma and mantle cell lymphoma (n = 1 each).  
1.4.3. Clinical Summary of Combination Treatment With PI3Kδ  Inhibition 
(INCB04 0093) and JAK Inhibition ( INCB039110)  
Study INCB 40093-102 is an ongoing, open- label, dose escalation, safety and tolerability study  
of the PI3K δ inhibitor INCB040093 as monotherapy and in combination with INCB039110.  As 
of 13 DEC 2015, 67 subjects had received treatment with the combination.  No evidence of any 
impact on the PK of the INCB040093 from coadministration of INCB039110 was apparent 
(INCB040093 IB).

1.4.4. Potential Risks of Combination Therapy of INCB050465 and INCB039110 
Incyte is proposing to study 2 investigational drugs INCB050465 and INCB039110 in 
combination for the treatment of relapsed/refractory B -cell malignancies.  The principle toxicity 
of inhibiting both PI3Kδ and JAK pathways is expected to be reversible effects on immune function.  Combined inhibition may adversely affect both B cell and T cell immune function with resultant increased risk of a v ariety of infections.  Subjects  will be closely monitored for bacterial 
infections, viral reactivation, and opportunistic infections, and treatment will be interrupted for infections that can be easily managed with antibiotic therapy and discontinued for infections that are serious or require prolonged antibiotic therapy.  Study INCB 40093-102 is combining 
another PI3Kδ inhibitor, INCB040093 with INCB039110.  The most frequently reported SAE in 
this study was PJP (5 subjects, 7.5%).  The use of a standard Pneumocystis prophylaxis regimen 
is now mandated in subjects receiving combination therapy with INCB040093 and INCB039110.  
Since implementing this requirement, no additional cases of PJP have been observed in subjects 
receiving prophylaxis.   Therefore, all subjects receiving combination therapy with INCB050465 
and INCB039110 in  this study must receive PJP prophylaxis.  Viral reactivation (ie, shingles) 
was observed in subjects receiving INCB040093 monotherapy and combination therapy with INCB039110. 
Effects on white blood cell, red blood cell, and platelet counts could result from JAK inhibition 
and result in infections, anemia, or thrombocytopenia requiring transfusions, which may be more 
likely in subjects  with NHL that is refractory to recent therapy or transplantation.  
INCB039110 has been shown to affect hematologic param eters ; however , cytopenias are not 
expected to be worse with combination PI3Kδ and JAK inhibition.  In the study combining INCB039110 with INCB040093 as of 13 DEC 2015, anemia has occurred in 14.9% of subjects receiving combination therapy.  Neutropenia has occurred in 28.4% of subjects receiving 
combination therapy; thrombocytopenia was reported in 31.3% of subjects receiving 
combination therapy (r efer to the INCB039110 IB ). 
Combined inhibition is not expected to increase the risk of hepatic toxicity and liver function testing will be monitored regularly.  Any hepatic toxicity is expected to be reversible.  These 
potential risks are considered acceptable in a population with relapsed/refractory lymphoid malignancies.  
1.5. Overview of Standard Therap ies 
1.5.1. Rituximab 
1.5.1.1. Pharmacology Summary 
Rituximab (RITUXAN®) is a CD -20 cytolytic antibody that has been approved in the United 
States for the treatment of NHL, CLL, rheumatoid arthritis, and granulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis ( Rituxan  2014).  Rituximab is used both as monotherapy and in 
combination with other agents in NHL.  
1.5.1.2. Potential Risks  
Boxed warnings for rituximab include fatal infusion reactions, severe mucocutaneous reactions, 
hepatitis B rea ctivations, and progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML).  Subjects 
CONFIDENTIAL  
Incyte Corporation  Page 35 of 115 
Protocol  INCB 50465- 101 Am 10 Version 10 07 AUG 2019  
should be premedicated and will be monitored closely during rituximab infusion, and medical 
treatment should be performed as necessary for infusion reactions as described in the package 
insert.  Mucocutaneous reactions observed in patients receiving rituximab include 
Stevens -Johnson syndrome, lichenoid dermatitis, vesiculobullous dermatitis, and toxic epidermal 
necrolysis.  Subjects who experience a severe mucocutaneous reaction should be discontinued.  
Hepatitis B virus reactivation can occur in patients receiving drugs classified as anti-CD20 
antibodies.  Subjects in this Protocol are screened for evidence of prior hepatitis B infection , 
which will mitigate the risk.  Progressive multifoc al leukoencephalopathy should be considered 
in any subject with new-onset neurologic manifestations.  Evaluation should be performed as described in the package insert.   
Additional risks an d precautions according to the package insert include tumor lysis syndrome 
infection (bacterial, fungal, and viral), cardiac events including arrhythmias, renal toxicities, and 
bowel obstruction and perforation.  Adverse reactions experienced by ≥ 30% of NHL subjects receiving monotherapy treatment with rituximab include  fever, chills, infection, and 
lymphopenia.  A complete discu ssion of risks associated with rituximab  can be found at 
http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/. 
1.5.2. R-ICE 
Rituximab is described in detail in Section  1.5.1. 
1.5.2.1. Ifosfam ide 
1.5.2.1.1. Pharmacology Summary 
Ifosfamide is an alkylating agent that crosslinks DNA and results in cell death.  Ifosfamide 
requires breakdown of the parent compound to metabolites in the l iver before it becomes active.  
1.5.2.1.2. Potential Risks  
The DLTs  of ifosfamide are myelosuppression and urotoxicity.  Dose fractionation, vigorous 
hydration, and a protector such as mesna can significantly reduce the incidence of hematuria.  
Subjects enrolled into this study will receive mesna with the infusion of ifosfamide to protect against urotoxicity.  Adverse reactions occurring in > 10% of patients receiving ifosfamide 
include alopecia, nausea, vomiting, hematuria, gross hematuria, and CNS toxicity ( IFEX  2015 ).

1.5.2.2. Carboplatin 
1.5.2.2.1. Pharmacology Summary 
Carboplatin is a platinum compound that produced interstrand DNA cross-links in a manner that 
is cell -cycle nonspecific.  Carboplatin is generally felt to be less  toxic than the earlier platinum 
agent, cisplatin.

1.5.2.2.2. Potential Risks  
Labeled warnings for carboplatin include bone marrow suppression, vomiting, and 
anaphylactic -like reactions.  Carboplatin should be administered under the supervision of a 
qualified physici an for appropriate management of therapy and complications.  Bone marrow 
suppression is the DLT , and blood counts will be monitored before each dose of carboplatin in 
this study.  Supportive care including transfusions and G-CSF may be administered per the site 's 
institutional policy.  Vomiting may be severe and the use of antiemetics prior to dose 
administration  may reduce this risk and is allowed on study ( Carboplatin 2015).  A complete 
discu ssion of risks associated with ifosfamide can be found at http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/. 
1.5.2.3. Etoposide 
1.5.2.3.1. Pharmacology Summary 
Etoposide is a topoisomerase II inhibitor that causes DNA strand breaks, which works to kill dividing cells by inhibiting DNA synthesis in the S phase.   
1.5.2.3.2. Potential Risk s 
Etoposide is to be administered under the supervision of a qualified physician.  Etoposide can 
cause severe myelosuppression with resulting infection or bleeding.  Blood counts will be 
monitored closely per Protocol, and dose administration  should be hel d if necessary to allow 
counts to sufficiently recover.  Other toxicities to be aware of include nausea and vomiting, 
which is generally mild to moderate and can be controlled with antiemetic therapy, hypotension following infusion, anaphylactic- like aller gic reactions, and alopecia ( Toposar 1998).   A

1.6. Study Rationale  
Lymphoid malignancies are the seventh leading cause of death i n the United States , and their 
incidence has been increasing , with an estimated incidence of approximately 7 9,190 cases in 
2012, with 70,130 cases of NHL and 9,060 cases of HL (Siegel  et al 2012 ).  Among these 
malignancies,  the majority are derived from B-lymphocytes.  Although several therapeutic 
approaches such as combination chemotherapy, external beam irradiation, hematopoietic 
stem -cell transplantation , and molecular targeted agents , including B -lymphocyte–specific 
antibodies used alone or conjugated with radiopharmaceuticals or toxins, have significantly 
improved the prognosis of these patients, the annual mortality rate remains high , with 
20,130 patients dying from these malignancies in 2012. 
The recognition that aberrant signal transduction occurs in malignant B-lymphocytes via the 
PI3K pathways , resulting in disease progression, has led to a focus on agents that modulate these 
signaling pathways.  On 13 NOV 2013, the FDA granted accelerated approval to ibrutinib for t he 
treatment of patients with MCL  who have received at least 1 prior therapy.  The approval was 
based on the results of a multicenter, single -group study demonstrat ing a 66% ORR (95% CI :  
56.2, 74.5).  Idelalisib  (a PI3K inhibitor) has been recently approv ed for the treatment of CLL in 
combination with rituximab, and as monotherapy for follicular lymphoma and small lymphocytic lymphoma.  The Phase 3 dose of idelalisib (150 mg twice daily [ BID]) was shown to have a C
min

Protocol  INCB 50465- 101 Am 10 Version 10 07 AUG 2019  
of approximately 1 μM (Flinn  et al 201 4) and is therefore not expect ed to cover the IC 90 for 
inhibiting Akt phosphorylation in whole blood (IC 90 = 1.8 μM ; refer to the  INCB050465 IB) 
throughout the treatment  interval.  As described in Section  1.2.1, INCB050465 is significantly 
more potent in all of the assays examined  (refer to the  INCB050465 IB ), and based on its 
projected PK would be expected to cover > IC90 at Cmin, suggesting that it may have more 
marked effects  than idelalisib  in the clinic.  
Incyte is proposing to study 2 new investigational drugs ( INCB050465 and INCB039110) in 
combination for the treatment of relapsed/refractory B -cell malignan cies.  Both the JAK/STAT 
and PI3K pathways may contribute to driving tumor growth and survival in DLBCL as described 
above, and combination therapies that block both pathways may prove more beneficial in these diseases due to the central role that JAK -medi ated cytokine signaling plays in augmenting 
BCR -mediated activation of the NF -κB pathway. 
In addition, Incyte is proposing to study INCB050465 in combination with a standard therapy in 
subjects with B -cell malignancies.  The therapy proposed is routinely used in  subjects with 
DLBCL, and the addition of a PI3Kδ inhibitor may improve the activity of this therapy  with 
limited additive toxicity from this  targeted agent.  
1.7. Justification of Route, Dose Regimen, and Treatment Period  
1.7.1. INCB050465 
INCB050465 is  being developed as a new investigational drug for oral administration .  Oral drug 
admi nistration is generally the most convenient and cost-effective method of drug delivery for 
medications requiring continuous exposure.  INCB050465 tablets will be administered orally (QD, BID , or intermittently) , as determined by emerging PK , pharmacodynamic ( PD), and safety  
data.  INCB039110 will be administered orally QD.  One cycle of INCB050465 monotherapy 
will be defined as 21 days of treatment  (eg, 21 continuous days of QD treatment, 21 days of 
once- weekly treatment) ; treatment for subjects in this study will consist of repeating 21 -day 
cycles.   Combination regimens with standard agents may have different cycle lengths to 
accommodate standard regimens.  
Preclinical data suggest that the whole blood IC
90 for INCB050465 is approximately 77 nM.  
Based on th e preclinical PK profile of  INCB050465, the clinical dose estimated to achieve IC 90 
at tro ugh is approximately 10 mg every 24 hours ; unbound C max after this dose is projected to be 
approximately 0.023 μM, and unbound AUC  is projected to be 0.37 μM·h.  Thus , it is reasonable 
to expect that full pharmacologic inhibition can be achieved with INCB050465 at a feasible clinical dose.  
Based on preclinical toxicology, the highest nonseverely toxic dose in the most sensitive species 
is 1 mg/kg per day in the dog.  This produces a human equivalent dose of 32 mg, and one- sixth 
of this dose indicates the estimated safe starting dose in oncology as 5.4 mg QD.  The NOAEL in 
the female dogs from the 28-day study (the most sensitive species) is 34.2 μM∙h (1.20 μM∙h 
unbound; refer to the  INCB050465 IB ).  The dose- related toxicities included changes in the 
lymphoid system consistent with pharmacological PI3Kδ inhibition (decrease in B-lymphocyte 
populations) by INCB050465.  The increase in incidence and/or severity of inflammatory 
changes was considered to be secondary to expected immunosuppression following PI3Kδ 
inhibition as inflammatory changes were noted in multiple tissues, secondary to putative loss in 
CONFIDENTIAL  
Incyte Corporation  Page 38 of 115 
Protocol  INCB 50465- 101 Am 10 Version 10 07 AUG 2019  
antibody protection.  Upon cessation of administration of INCB050465, all of the inflammatory 
changes were reversed, with no histologic evidence of residual damage to the affected tissues.  
Based on this information, the initial dose will be 5 mg QD.  Based on preclinical models, INCB50465 has an IC
50 of approximately 9 nM and IC 90 of 77 nM.  The estimated plasma 
concentration in humans for a 5 mg QD dose exceeds the IC 50 for 24 hours and the IC 90 for 
approximately 12 hours. 
Dose escalation will be conducted with a 3 + 3 design, with the exception that the first cohort 
(dose level of 5 mg QD) will be a single subject cohort.  For each subsequent dose level, dose 
escalation will be conducted with a 3  + 3 dose titration design.  The initial cohort will consist of 
a single subject; and the initial dose will be 5 mg QD.  If a Grade 2 or greater AE is observed in 
the initial single subject cohort, the cohort will be expanded to 3 subjects.  Subsequent cohorts 
will have increases in the dose of INCB050465 limited to no more than 50%.  If a Grade 2 or 
greater AE is not observed, the dose of INCB050465 will be increased to 10 mg QD (or 5 mg BID depending on PK data) in the subsequent cohort, and dose escalation will be conducted 
using a 3 + 3 dose titration  design.  After the 10 mg QD (or 5 mg BID) dose level cohort, 
subsequent increases in the dose of INCB050465 will be limited to no more than 50%.  Doses 
less than  5 mg QD may also be explored. 
Expansion cohorts of 15 to 30 subjects will be treated with the selected dose, either the 
maximum tolerated dose ( MTD ) or the PAD of INCB050465, as a single agent to further 
determine safety, tolerability, efficacy, PK, and PD  in this population.  Part 3 Cohort A will 
study INCB050465 in subjects with refractory B- cell malignancies.  The subject s in Part 3 
Cohort A will also be used for an optional evaluation of food effect.   (Note that the food- effect 
study may be terminated based on emerging data before completing enrollment of Cohort A .)  If 
the dose selected for the expansion cohort was the MTD in the dose-escalation part of the study, on Cycle 1 Day 15 and Cycle 2 Day 1, the dos e administered ONLY for these 2  doses will be 
1 dose level below the MTD (if the PAD is selected for the expansion cohort, there will be no 
alterat ion to the doses on Cycle 1 Day  15 or Cycle 2 Day 1). 
The sponsor may implement alternative regimens  such as intermediate doses , intermittent dosing 
schedules , BID doses, or alternative formulations, depending on PK, PD, and safety results. 
Based on emerging efficacy and safety data from study  INCB 50465-101 as of 02 SEP 2016, 
1 recommended regimen  that will be evaluated in Parts 2, 3, and 6 is 20 mg QD for 9 weeks, 
followed by 20 mg once weekly.  The 20 mg QD dose provides exposure that is approximately 2-fold greater than the IC
90 (based on an in vitro  whole-blood assay) at trough.  Furthermore, all 
11 NHL subjects who received 20 mg QD have achieved an objective response.  However, 24% 
of all 46 subjects in study INCB 50465-101 as of 02 SEP 2016 discontinued study treatment due 
to an AE.  Among the subjects with an objective response (n = 20), 7 (35%) discontinued study 
treatment due to an AE.  Consequently, after administration of 20 mg QD for 9 weeks, the dosing regimen will be reduced to 20 mg once weekly. This once- weekly  regimen is proposed to 
maintain response while providing time off from pathway inhibition, which may reduce the frequency of AEs.  Pharmacodynamic data from INCB  50465-101 showed that a single dose of 
20 mg exhibited maximal inhibition of AKT in an ex vivo pharmacodynamic assay, and PK 
modeling suggests that 20 mg once weekly will 1) achieve maximal inhibition equivalent to approximately 10 × IC
90, 2) exceed the IC 90 for approximately 36 hours, and 3) have minimal to 
no inhibition for approximately half the dosing interval.  This once- weekly regimen is similar to 
CONFIDENTIAL  
Incyte Corporation  Page 39 of 115 
Protocol  INCB 50465- 101 Am 10 Version 10 07 AUG 2019  
that of another PI3K inhibitor (copanlisib), which is administered intravenously on Days 1, 8, 
and 15 of a 28- day cycle, and which achieved 7  objective responses in 9 subjects with 
non-Hodgkin lymphoma ( Patnaik  et al 2016). Among the 51 subjects who received study drug, 
4 discontinued treatment due to an AE. There were 2 events of Grade 3 noninfectious pneumonitis, 1 event of Grade 3 diarrhea, and no events of colitis. 
1.7.2. INCB039110 
For Part 2, the initial starting dose for the other investigational agent, INCB039110, to be 
administered in combination with INCB050465, will be 300 mg QD.  Pharmacokinetic and 
safety data from prior studies in nononcologic indications support QD administration of 
INCB039110 in this study.  In the combination Phase 1 study INCB 40093-102, the MTD  of 
INCB039110 was not reached when given at doses up to 600 mg QD in combination with 
another PI3Kδ inhibitor, INCB040093.  However, based on an increas ed incidence of 
thrombocytopenia and neutropenia in subjects receiving a dose of 600 mg QD, the dose of INCB039110 was reduced to 400 mg in combination with INCB040093 for use in the expansion cohort .  Although this combination is tolerated, emerging PK and PD data indicate that inhibition 
of the JAK/STAT pathway at this dose exceeds the target (approximately 50%-60%).  As the 
probability of some AE s, such as cytopenias and infections, may correspond to the level of 
inhibition of INCB039110, 300 mg QD i s considered an appropriate dose level for chronic 
administration and will be the starting dose of INCB039110 in combination with INCB050465.  Alternative dose regimen  strategies may be explored based on the aggregate safety, PK, PD, and 
clinical activity data .  For instance, i f INCB039110 300 mg QD is not tolerated, then 
INCB039110 200 mg QD will be combined with INCB050465 ( see Section  1.3.4).  
1.7.3. R-ICE in Combination With INCB050465 
In Part 6 of the study, INCB050465 w ill be administered at a starting dose approximately 25% 
(rounded down to the nearest tablet size combination) below the recommended dose determined 
in Part 1 in combination with the R-ICE chemotherapy regimen at the following doses for three 
21-day cycles : 
• Rituximab 375 mg/m
2 given on Day 1 and Day 2 of Cycle 1 and on Day 1 of Cycles 2 
and 3. 
• Ifosfamide 5000 mg/m2 continuous IV infusion over 24 hours on Day 3. 
− Mesna should be added to ifosfamide infusion. 
• Carboplatin area under the curve (AUC) = 5  mg/mL  (maximum dose 800 mg) IV 
infusion on Day 3. 
• Etoposide 100 mg/m2 IV on Days 3 to 5. 
Note:  As an alternat ive to the Protocol-specified dose and schedule, R- ICE may also be 
administered per institutional practice  with medical monitor approval. 
If tolerated, th e dose of INCB050465 will be escalated to the recommended dose in combination 
with R -ICE.  The selected doses of the components of R- ICE have been administered to subjects 
with DLBCL in a number of clinical studies  (Zelenetz  et al 2003, Kewalramani  et al 2004, 
Gisselbrecht  2010, Feldman  et al 2014, Matasar  et al 2013).   The 21- day cycle was used by

here to allow subjects the maximum time to recover from any toxicities including 
myelosuppression.  INCB050465 may  be administered continuously or intermittently .

4. INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
4.1. Study Drugs  
The investigational drugs in this study include INCB050465 and INCB039110.  All study subjects will receive these study drugs in an open -label manner, as oral, self -administered agents.  
INCB050465 will be administered in all parts of the  study.  INCB039110 will only be 
administered in Part 2 and Part 3 Expansion Cohorts E. 
4.2. Overall Study Design  
The study consists of 4 parts.  The overall study design is shown in  Figure  2.  Monotherapy dose 
escalation (Part 1) will determine recommended  dose(s) to be explored further.  The 
recommended dose(s) will be defined as dose(s) at least equivalent to the PAD (a dose that produced substantial pharmacologic target inhibition) and no higher than the MTD. 
Part 2 will evaluate the combination of INCB050465 and INCB039110 to determine the 
recommended dose (s) of the combination. 
Expansion (Part 3), which consists of 5 cohorts, will evaluate the recommended dose(s) of 
INCB050465 as monotherapy and in combination with INCB039110.  The monotherapy 
dose-expansion cohorts will evaluate INCB050465 in subjects with B- cell malignancies , indolent  
lymphoma, DLBCL, and HL.  Note that expansion cohorts for INCB050465 monotherapy may 
explore more than 1 recommended dose and schedule to obtain long- term safety data on multiple 
dose levels  and schedules.  The combination expansion cohorts will evaluate the chosen 
combination dose of INCB050465 and INCB039110 in subjects with B- cell malignancies .   
Part 6 will include a safety assessment of INCB050465 in combination with the chemotherapy 
regimen R -ICE (rituximab, ifosfamide , carboplatin, and etoposide) in subjects with B -cell 
malignancies, followed by an expansion cohort in DLBCL.  Timing for the initiation of Part 6 
will be determined by the sponsor based on emerging data from Parts 1 and 3 of the study.  Note, 
for purposes of consistency and database completion, this will remain Part 6.

subjects.  
Figure  2: Study Design  
 
4.2.1. Part 1 – Monotherapy D ose Escalation of INCB050465 
Dose escalation will be conducted with a 3 + 3 design, with the exception that the first cohort 
(dose level of 5 mg QD) will be a single subject cohort.  There will be an observation period of 
21 days before enrollment of the next cohort and administration of the next dose level.  Subjects 
who receive at least 17 days of INCB050465 at the level assigned to that cohort will be considered evaluable for determining tolerability of dose.  Subjects enrolling but not meeting 
these criteria may be replaced in order to fill the cohort. 
• The initial cohort will consist of a single subject (the cohort may include an additional subject to ensure completion of 1 evaluable subject through Day 21); the initial dose 
will be 5  mg QD.  
− If a Grade 2 or greater AE is observed, the cohort will be expanded to 3 subjects.  If the initial cohort is expanded to 3 subjects, the safety assessment will follow the 
3 + 3 design .  Subsequent cohorts will have increases in the dose of INCB050465 
limited to no more than 5 0%. 
− If a Grade 2 or greater AE is not observed, the dose of INCB050465 will be increased to 10 mg QD (or 5 mg BID depending on PK data) in the subsequent 
cohort, and dose escalation will be conducted using a 3 + 3 dose titration design.  After the 10 mg QD (or 5 mg BID) dose level cohort, subsequent increases in the 
dose of INCB050465 will be limited to no more than 50%. 
− If the MTD has been exceeded or the PAD has been achieved in the initial cohort, 
this cohort may be expanded to at least 3 subjects and a lower dose of 
INCB050465 (eg, 2.5 mg QD) may be explored. 
CONFIDENTIAL  
Incyte Corporation  Page 46 of 115 
Protocol  INCB 50465- 101 Am 10 Version 10 07 AUG 2019  
• With the 3  + 3 design, each  cohort will enroll a minimum of 3 subjects .  If no DLTs 
are observed in the initial 3 subjects, the next cohort will begin enrollment.  If 1 DLT 
is observed in the first 3 subjects, 3 additional subjects will be enrolled in the cohort.  If DLTs occur in > 1 of the first 3 subjects or the total cohort of 6 subjects, then the 
MTD will be deemed to have been exceeded and the next lower tolerable dose level 
will be deemed to b e the MTD . 
• If the dose increment has been 100% and deemed exceeding the MTD, an 
intermediate dose level may be explored (eg, from 10 mg QD to 7.5 mg QD). 
• Dose increases will occur  using 1 of 2 options:  1) increasing the number of tablets 
taken at each QD administration, or 2) increasing the dose frequency to BID.  For 
example, based on safety in a cohort receiving 5  mg QD, the total daily dose might be 
increased 2 -fold in the next cohort by using a 5 mg BID regimen or by using a 10 mg 
QD regimen, depending on emerging PK data.  The dose regimen will be designed to maintain a suitable peak -to-trough ratio and minimize accumulation.  
If a dose level is reached that provides a suitable profile of pharmacologic target inhibition 
(PAD)  before reaching the MTD, then th is dos e may be deemed  a recommended dose (s) and 
used to move to Part 3 monotherapy dose expansion, as well as taken to Part 2 for testing in the combination.  Dose escalation of the monotherapy may continue at doses above the PAD until the MTD is reached or dose escalation is stopped.  In the even t that the half -life suggests 
alternative schedules will provide optimum target inhibition, additional cohorts may be evaluated (eg, BID administration).  
4.2.2. Part 2 – Dose Escalation With the Combination of INCB0504065 and 
INCB039110 
Dose escalation will proceed using a 3 + 3 design with  a starting dose of INCB050465 
approximately 25% (rounded down to the nearest tablet size combination) below the 
recommended dose determined in Part 1 followed by escalation of INCB050465 in combination 
with INCB039110 300 mg QD.  Escalation of the dose of INCB050465 will continue in 
combination with INCB039110 300 mg QD until the recommended dose is determined .  If the 
starting dose of INCB050465 cannot be combined safely with INCB0 39110 300 mg QD, 
INCB039110 at 200 mg QD will be tested.  If that combination is tolerated, escalation of INCB050465 will proceed with  INCB039110 200 mg QD.   Additional dose de- escalatio n may 
occur with INCB050465 if DLTs occur with a causality that can be reasonably assigned to 
INCB050465.  Additional dose escalation or de -escalation of INCB039110 and/or INCB050465 
may be considered if supported by emerging safety, PK,  data in this combination .   
4.2.3. Part 3 – Expansion 
Monotherapy Expansion Cohorts A, B, C,  and D will open when the recommended dose(s) is 
chosen from Part 1, independently from Part 2.  Recommended dose(s) will be at least equivalent to the PAD and no higher than the MTD (or the highest dose tested).  Expansion Cohort A will enroll subject s with B-cell malignancies,  Cohort B  will enroll subjects with HL, Cohort C will 
enroll subjects with DLBCL , and Cohort D will enroll subjects with indolent lymphoma.  Note 
that expansion cohorts for INCB050465 monotherapy may explore more than 1 recommend ed 
dose and schedule to obtain long- term safety  data on multiple dose levels  and schedules. 
CONFIDENTIAL

Protocol  INCB 50465- 101 Am 10 Version 10 07 AUG 2019  
When the recommended dose for Phase 2 combination therapy has been determined from Part 2, 
enrollment will proceed simultaneously for Expansion Cohort E, which  will enroll subjects with 
B-cell malignancies .  Details regarding the dose expansion cohorts are described in Table 1. 
If ≥ 5 subjects in  the first 15 subjects of any cohort , cumulatively, (or more than 33% of subjects 
in cohorts larger than 15 subjects) experience DLTs during Cycle 1, then further enrollment to 
the cohort will be stopped, and a lower dose level may be exp lored.  Based on emerging data, the 
sponsor may decide on the number of subjects with a specific subtype of an indication to be enrolled into each expansion cohort (eg, non- GCB or GCB in DLBCL)  or specific tumor types to 
be enrolled in Cohorts A and E (eg,  mantle cell lymphoma ).

indication to be enrolled (eg, non -GCB or GCB).  
4.2.4. Part 6 – Dose Evaluation and E xpansion With the Combination of INCB050465 
and R -ICE 
Initiation of Part 6 dose evaluation will be dependent on preliminary data from Parts 1 and 3 of 
the study.  Dose evaluation would proceed in subjects  with DLBCL using a 3 + 3 design with a 
starting dose of INCB050465 approximately 25% (rounded down to the nearest tablet size combination) below the recommended dose deter mined in Part 1 in combination with the 
chemotherapy components at the following doses in a 21- day cycle for a total of 3 cycles:  
• Rituximab 375 mg/m
2 given  on Day 1 and Day 2 of Cycle 1, and on Day 1 of 
Cycles  2 and 3. 
• Ifosfamide 5000 mg/m2 continuous IV infusion over 24 hours on Day 3. 
− Mesna should be added to ifosfamide infusion. 
• Carboplatin AUC = 5 mg/mL (maximum dose 800 mg) IV infusion on Day 3. 
• Etoposide 100 mg/m2 IV on Days 3 to 5. 
Note:  As an alternat ive to the Protocol-specified dose and schedule,  R-ICE may be administered 
according to institutional practice  with medical monitor approval. 
If tolerated, the dose of INCB050465 will be escalated to the recommended dose in combination with R -ICE.  INCB050465 will be given daily or intermittently  and may be continued until a 
criterion is met for treatment discontinuation .  If the starting dose of INCB050465 cannot be 
combined safely with  R-ICE at  the schedule described above, the dose of INCB050465 will be 
reduced to 25% below the dose first administered in combination with R- ICE.  Additional dose 
de-escalation may occur with INCB050465 if DLTs  occur with a causality that can be reasonably

Protocol  INCB 50465- 101 Am 10 Version 10 07 AUG 2019  
assigned to INCB050465.  Additional dose de-escalation of INCB050465 and intermittent 
schedules may be considered if supported by emerging safety, PK,  data in this 
combination.  Following the identification of a tolerable dose of the combination of 
INCB050465 and R- ICE (a dose less than or equal to the MTD), expanded Cohort L will be 
opened to further evaluate the safety, efficacy, PK,  as described in Table 2.

a Based on emerging data, the sponsor may decide on the number of subjects with a specific subtype of an 
indication to be enrolled (eg, non -GCB or GCB).  
If ≥ 5 subjects in Cohort L experience DLTs during Cycle 1, further enrollment to the cohort will 
be stopped, and a lower dose level may be explored.  
4.2.5. Cross over to Combination Therapy A fter Monotherapy  Treatment  
For subjects who discontinue INCB050465 monot herapy for a reason described in Section  5.7.1, 
the investigator may feel that the best option for the subject is to enroll in a combination therapy 
offered in this Protocol.  Prior use of a PI3K inhibitor is not prohibited per the 
inclusion/exclusion criteria for combination cohorts.  Therefore, subjects who discontinue 
INCB050465 may be allowed to cross  over to combination therapy.  In these cases, the subject 
must meet the eligib ility criteria for the cohort they will cross  over to , and the sponsor must 
approve the crossover.   
4.3. Study  Endpoints  
4.3.1. Primary Endpoint  
• Safety and tolerability of the planned study treatments as assessed by summary of 
AEs, clinical laboratory assessments, physical examination results, and 12- lead 
ECGs.  
4.3.2. Secondary Endpoints  
• Efficacy as measured by ORR , defined as the sum of subjects achieving a minor 
response (MR, only among subjects with WM), PR , very good partial response 
(VGPR, only among subjects with WM), and CR to the planned study trea tments  
based on: 
− International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (IWCLL) criteria for 
CLL ( Hallek  et al 2008, Cheson et al 2012).  
− VIth International Workshop on Waldenström macroglobulinemia response assessment for subjects with Waldenström macroglobulinemia  (Owen  et al 2013)  
− Revised response criteria for lymphoma for HL  and NHL  (Cheson et al 2014 ). 
• C
max, Tmax, Cmin,  AUC 0-t, and AUC 0-τ at Cycle 1 Day 15 of INCB039110 in 
combination with INCB050465.

• Cmax, Tmax, Cmin, AUC 0-t, and AUC 0-τ of INCB050465 as monotherapy and in 
combination with  INCB039110. 
4.4. Measures Taken to Avoid Bias  
This is an open- label study; no comparisons will be made between subjects or against historical 
controls.  Measurements of safety and efficacy are objective measurements and only 
comparisons to pre treatment conditions will be made.  
4.5. Number of Subjects  
Up to approximately 150 subjects are planned for enrollment at  approximately  15 sites .  The 
number of subjects may vary due to the number of cohorts required to determine the tolerated or 
recommended dose. 
4.6. Study Termination  
If a PAD (eg, trough plasma concentration of ≥ IC90) cannot be reached in a cohort with less than 
one-third of the subjects experiencing a DLT  as monotherapy or combination therapy, the study 
will be terminated.  
The sponsor may terminate the study electively or if required by regulatory decision .  If the study 
is terminated prematurely, the sponsor will notify the investigators, the institutional review 
boards and independent ethics committees (IRB s/IECs), and regulatory bodies of the decision 
and the reason for termination of the study.   
The investi gator retains the right to terminate study participation at any time, according to the 
terms specified in the study contract.  The investigator is to notify the IRB or IEC in writing of  
the study's completion or early termination, and send a copy of the notification to the sponsor or 
sponsor' s designee and retain 1 copy for the site study regulatory file.

5. TREATMENT OF SUBJECTS 
5.1. Treatment Groups  and Administration of Study Drug 
5.1.1. INCB050465 Monotherapy 
Subjects will self -administer INCB050465 using an oral dail y QD , BID, or intermittent regimen, 
as instructed by the investigator.  INCB050465 should be administered in the clinic on Days 1, 8, 
and 15 of Cycle 1.  Subjects enrolled in Part 3 Cohort A participating in the food- effect study 
will also have INCB050465 administered in clinic on Cycle 2 Day 1.  INCB050465 will be taken 
orally with water without regard to food.  If QD or once- weekly intervals are used, INCB050465 
should be taken at approximately the same time each day . 
5.1.2. INCB050465 and INCB039110 Combination Therapy  
In Part 2 and Part 3 (Cohort E), subjects will concomitantly receive INCB039110 ( administered 
QD) with INCB050465.  INCB050465 and INCB039110 should be administered in the clinic on Days 1 , 8, and 15 of Cycle 1.  INCB039110 will be given after all INCB050465 PK sampling is 
complete on Day 1.  At other designated visits where INCB039110 is administered at the site, it can be given with INCB050465.  For either drug, if a dose of is missed, the subject should skip the dose and take the next scheduled dose at the usual time.    
If BID doses are used, INCB050465 should be taken morning and evening, at approximately 12-hour intervals.  For QD administration , if a dose is missed  by more than 12 hours, the subject 
should skip the dose and take the next sched uled dose at the usual time.  For BID administration , 
if the morning or evening dose is missed by more than 4 hours, the subject should skip that dose and take next scheduled dose at the usual time.  For once-weekly dosing, if the dose is missed by more th an 2 days, the subject should skip the dose and take the next scheduled dose. 
One cycle will be defined as 21 days of treatment; subjects will receive treatment in continuous cycles.  All subjects will attend study visits weekly during the first cycle, and  at the beginning of 
each 21 -day cycle thereafter.   
5.1.3. INCB050465 and R- ICE Combination Therapy  
Subjects enrolled into Part 6 of the study will receive INCB050465 continuously in 21- day 
cycles.  INCB050465 should be administered in the clinic on Days 1 and 15 of Cycle 1.  The R-ICE chemotherapy regimen will be administered as described below for 3 cycles , which will 
be 21 days each.  INCB050465 may be continued until a criterion is met for treatment discontinuation. 
• Rituximab 375 mg/m
2 given on Day 1 and Day 2 of Cycle 1 and on Day 1 of Cycles 2 
and 3. 
• Ifosfamide 5000 mg/m2 continuous IV infusion over 24 hours on Day 3 of each cycle. 
− Mesna will be infused with ifosfamide . 
CONFIDENTIAL  
Incyte Corporation  Page 51 of 115 
Protocol  INCB 50465- 101 Am 10 Version 10 07 AUG 2019  
• Carboplatin area under the curve = 5 (maximum dose 800 mg) IV infusion on Day 3 
of each cycle. 
• Etoposide 100 mg/m2 IV on Days 3 to 5 of each cycle. 
Note:   As an alternat ive to the Protocol-specified dose and schedule, R- ICE may be administered 
per institutional practice  with medical monitor approval. 
5.2. Treatment Compliance  
Subjects should be counseled by the i nvestigator to maintain strict adherence to the study 
regimen as prescribed and to keep a record of any missed doses.   Subject diaries w ill be provided 
for the purposes of keeping accurate documentation of study drug administration and treatment 
compliance.   The subject will be instructed to bring all unopened, empty, and opened/partially 
used bottles of study drug to each study visit, at which time compliance will be  assessed.  
5.3. Randomization and Blinding  
Not applicable.  
5.4. Duration of Treatment a nd Subject Participation  
Subjects in Parts 1, 2, and 3 will be treated in continuous 21- day cycles indefinitely; this may 
include temporary interruptions described in Section  5.6.  Subjects in Part  6 will be trea ted in 
21-day cycles .  INCB050465 may continue indefinitely, but R-ICE will only be given for 
3 cycles.  
Subjects who have evidence of objective clinical benefit, regardless of dose level, may continue 
to be treated at that dose level.  Dose and schedule changes may be implemented for ongoing 
subjects based on emerging tolerability data.  If study drug is permanently discontinued (for 
reasons, see Section  5.6.2.1) the subject will be withdrawn from the study.  Treatment duration 
will vary  among subjects, but is expected to average approximately 6  months. 
5.5. Rationale  for Dose Modification  
Selections and modifications to the dosage of study drug are planned for dose-escalation cohorts.  
Also, dose interruptions and modifications may occur for individual study subjects.  The identification of DLTs will define the doses used in planned cohorts.  Further, the occurrence of 
DLTs and other toxicities will guide decisions for treatment interruptions and discontinuation for individual subjects. 
Subjects enrolled in lower doses in the dose-escalation portion of the study will have the option 
of escalating to a dose found to be tolerated in a subsequent cohort provided the criteria specified in Section  5.6.1 are met.  
5.5.1. Dose -Limiting Toxicity  
A DLT  is any AE noted in Table 3
.  DLTs include all AEs of the specified grades, regardless of 
investigator attribution of relatedness.  AEs occurring during Cycle 1 of the dose- escalation  
portion of the study will be considered to be DLTs if they are not clearly related to the 
underlying disease, its progression, a comorbidity, concomitant medication, or transient

(≤ 72 hours) abnormal laboratory values without associated clinically significant signs or 
symptoms based on investigator determination.  Events not meeting these precise criteria may be 
considered DLTs as determined during review by the Incy te medical monitor and principal 
investigators.  
Individual subject dose reductions may be made based on events observed at any time during treatment with INCB050465; however, for the purposes of dose cohort escalation/de- escalation, 
expanding a dose cohort, and determining the MTD or recommended dose of INCB050465, 
decisions will be made based on events deemed to be DLTs that are observed from the first day of INCB050465 administration through and including the final day of Cycle 1 (Day 21 or Day 28 
depending on the part of the study that the subject has been enrolled to); in addition, a ll safety  
data available to date will be considered . 
Each dose cohort in this study will be reviewed before  dose escalation by the Incyte medical 
monitor and principal investigators.  Telephone conferences will be scheduled by the sponsor with all investigators in order to review cohort- specific data and overall safety data from prior 
cohorts (if applicable), and to agree on dose escalation and the recommended dose for Phase 2 per DLT rules defined in this section.  
Dose -limiting toxicities will be assessed by the investigator using the current CTCAE version 
4.03 criteria.  All toxicities will be graded based on the highest grade that is actually reached , 
rather than the level that might have been reached if left untreated .  A DLT will be defined as 
any AE that is  new in onset or worsening in severity and meet s any of the criteria listed in 
Table 3. 
Table 3: Definition of Dose -Limiting Toxicity  
Nonhematologic:  
• ≥ Grade 3  nonhematologic toxicity, excluding nausea, vomiting, diarrhea. 
• ≥ Grade 3 nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea unco ntrolled by maximal antiemetic/ antidiarrheal therapy 
lasting > 48 hours. 
• Any toxicity considered a DLT in the opinion of the i nvestigator  and medical monitor. 
Hematologic:   
• Grade 4 neutropenia  lasting ≥ 7 days. 
NOTE:  INCB039110 is suspected to cause transient decreases in white blood cells due to 
margination, therefore, DLT rule s require neutropenia to persist after holding INCBC039110 for 
2 to 3 days.  Where the clinical status of the subject allows, investigators are encouraged to wait 
24 hours before starting growth factors, to determine if white blood cell marg ination is 
contributing to the  degree of neutropenia.   
• Febrile neutropenia (ANC < 1 .0 × 109/L with a single temperature of > 38.3°C (101°F) or a 
sustained temperature of ≥ 38°C (100.4°F) for more than 1 hour). 
• Grade 3 t hrombocytopenia associated with clinically significant bleeding (clinically significant as 
determined by the investigator or result ing in the need for a transfusion of red blood cells). 
• Grade 4 thrombocytopenia  lasting > 7 days . 
• Grade 4 anemia.  
General:  
• Any specific AE that results in a dose delay or reduction in > one- third of subjects .

5.5.2. Follow- Up of Dose -Limiting Toxicities  
Any DL T should be followed until it resolves to baseline or appears to have stabilized for a 
minimum of 4 weeks.  During follow-up subjects should be seen as often as medically indicated 
to assure safety.  
5.5.3. Management of Dose -Limiting Toxicities  or Other Urgent Si tuations  
In all cases investigators are free to employ any measures or concomitant medications, following 
discussion with sponsor , necessary to optimally treat the subject.  
5.6. Dose Adjustment  of Study Drug  
5.6.1. Planned Dose Adjustments  
Cohort dose escalation is described in Section  4.1.  Intrasubject dose escalation of INCB050465 
will be allowed  during dose escalation , provided that the following criteria are met:  
• The Protocol inclusion criteria are met.  
• The subject has received 4 cycles of study drug and has not had a related or possibly 
related toxicity ≥  Grade 2.  
• The next dose level has been determined to be safe based on DLT rules (eg, no DLTs during Cycle 1). 
• The subject is willing to submit to  all visits and procedur es as in Cycle 1 per the 
Protocol, except  the PK sampling will only be done as on Cycle 1  Day 15 (Day 1 
and Day 8 PK sampling will not be done). 
• In the opinion of the investigator, the subject does not have any concurrent condition or circumstance th at would  complicate the dose escalation or  PK sampling, or pose 
increased risk to the subject.  
• The intrasubject dose escalation has been approved by the sponsor. 
5.6.2. Criteria  and Procedures  for Dose Interruption s and Dose Reductions  of 
INCB050465 and INCB039110 
In some circumstances, it may be necessary to temporarily interrupt treatment as a result of adverse experiences that may have an unclear relationship to study drug.  Treatment with 
INCB050465, the combination with INCB039110 , or the combination with standard therapies 
may be delayed up to 2 weeks to allow for resolution of toxicity.  If treatment  needs to be 
interrupted in subjects receiving the combination of INCB050465 and INCB039110 for toxicities 
with unknown causality, both study medications should be held.  However, based on the evolving experience with the study treatments, the suspected causal  agent only may be held 
(while the other study treatment continues) until resolution of toxicity following consultation and approval with the medical monitor.  Subjects may resume treatment if n o medical condition or 
other circumstance exis ts that, in the opinion of the investigator, would make the subject 
unsuitable for further participation in the study.  The treating i nvestigator should contact the 
sponsor' s medical monitor to discuss the case of any subject whose treatment has been delayed 
for more than 14 days before treatment with INCB050465 or the combination of INCB050465 
CONFIDENTIAL

Protocol  INCB 50465- 101 Am 10 Version 10 07 AUG 2019  
and INCB039110 may be restarted  (see Table 4 ).  Dose reductions of 1 or both (as applicable for 
subjects on combination therapy) study treatments may be necessary as described in Table 4.  
For subjects who start on the 300 mg QD dose of INCB039110, the first dose reduction would be 
to 200 mg QD.   If subjects start at a 200 mg QD dose of INCB039110, the combination of 
INCB050465 with INCB039110 at a lower dose (eg, 100 mg QD) will be subject to discussion 
with the sponsor.  Alternatively, INCB039110 may be discontinued if dose reduction is 
indicated , and subjects may continue on INCB050465 monotherapy if they continue to receive 
benefit.  
Because subjects may enter the study with extensive pretreatment and/or severe bone marrow 
infiltration by the primary dise ase, these dose-reduction rules are provided as guidelines.  
Individual decisions regarding dose reduction should be made using clinical judgment and in consultation with the sponsor' s medical m onitor, taking into account relatedness of the AE to the 
study drug and the subject's underlying condition.  Subjects receiving dose reductions (but not 
meeting DLT criteria) during the first cycle will not be considered evaluable for the purposes of determining the MTD.

TOXICITY/NCI CTCAE GRADE  ACTION TAKEN  
Other drug -related toxicities  or toxicities not 
attributable to other causes :  
Diarrhea/colitis (Grade 1)  Step 1:  Treat with antimotility agents (eg, 4 mg loperamide 
followed by 2 mg every 4 hours or after every unformed stool) 
and initiate supportive care (see Section  5.6.2.1 ).  If not 
improved after 48 hours, treat per guidance for ≥ Grade 2.  
Diarrhea/colitis ( ≥ Grade 2)  Step1:   Interrupt INCB050465.  Perform work -up for infection 
(including CMV, C. difficile , etc).  Initiate or continue 
supportive care (see Section  5.6.2.1 ).  Consider col onoscopy 
with biopsy for ≥ Grade  3. 
Step 2:   If infection is ruled out, start oral steroids, or consider 
IV steroids if subject is being given IV fluids.  If no improvement with oral steroids, switch to IV steroids.  
When diarrhea resolves to ≤ Grade 1, con tinue supportive care 
and taper steroids over 4 weeks.  When taper is complete and diarrhea is ≤ Grade 1, restart INCB050465 at next lower dose  in 
consultation with  the medical monitor.  
If  ≥ Grade  2 diarrhea reoccurs, permanently discontinue 
INCB050465.  
Pneumonitis (Grade 1)  Step 1:  Interrupt INCB050465 until the toxicity has resolved.   
Step 2:   Restart INCB050465 at next lower dose.  Monitor as 
clinically indicated.  
Pneumonitis (Grade  ≥  2) Permanently discontinue INCB050465.  
Skin toxicity (eg, rash, pruritus, etc, unless 
otherwise specified) (Grade 2 -3) Step 1:  Interrupt INCB050465 until the toxicity has resolved to 
≤ Grade 1.  
Step 2:  Restart INCB050465  at same dose.  If assessed as 
related to INCB050465, restart at next lower dose  in 
consultation with the medical monitor . 
Exfoliative dermatitis (Grade 1)  Step 1:  Interrupt INCB050465 until the toxicity has resolved.  
Step 2:   Restart INCB050465 at next lower dose.  Monitor as 
clinically indicated.  
Exfoliative dermatitis (≥ Grade 2)  Permanently discontinue INCB050465.  
Intestinal perforation (any grade)  Permanently discontinue INCB050465.  
Pneumocystis jiroveci  pneumonia infection  Interrupt INCB050465.  Permanently discontinue INCB050465 if Pneumocystis jiroveci  pneumonia infection is confirmed.  
CMV infection  Subjects with CMV viremia without associated clinical signs of 
CMV infection should be carefully monitored.  Consider 
interrupting INCB050465 for subjects with CMV viremia and 
clinical signs of infection until the infection has resolved.  Resta rt INCB050465 reduced by 1 dose level if approved by the 
medical monitor.  
Varicella zoster infection  Interrupt INCB050465.  Restart INCB050465 only by approval 
of the medical monitor.  
Any Grade 1 or 2 toxicity  unless otherwise 
specified  Continue study dr ug treatment(s); monitor as clinically 
indicated.

a Note:  Only 2 dose reductions  due to AEs are permitted . 
5.6.2.1. Supportive Care Guidelines for Diarrhea/Colitis  
Subjects should be informed to immediately report to the investigator any event of diarrhea.  
Subjects should receive appropriate supportive care measures as deemed necessary by the investigator.  For any Grade ≥ 1 diarrhea, subjects should be advised to drink liberal quantities of 
clear fluids.  If sufficient oral fluid intake is not feasible, fluid and electrolytes should be 
substituted via IV infusion.  Subjects should try to eat 5 to 6 small meals per day; low-fat, high-protein foods; and cooked instead of raw vegetables.  Subjects may supplement their diet with 
bananas, rice, applesauce, and toast to reduce the number of bowel movements, and may also try 
crackers, gelatin, noodles, or oatmeal.  Subjects should avoid fried, fatty, greasy, or spicy foods; milk, milk products, and acidic drinks; high-fiber foods and foods that cause gas; and alcohol, 
caffeine, and herbal supplements ( Coutré et al 2015 ). 
For each occurrence, attempts should be made to rule out other causes, such a s metastatic disease 
or bacterial or viral infection (including CMV), which might require additional supportive care. 
It may be necessary to perform conditional procedures such as colonoscopy with biopsy as part 
of evaluation of the event.  Note that sever al courses of steroid tapering may be necessary as 
symptoms may worsen when the steroid dose is decreased. 
Subjects should be carefully monitored for signs and symptoms of enterocolitis (such as diarrhea, 
abdominal pain or cramping, blood or mucus in stool, with or without fever) and of bowel perforation (such as peritoneal signs and ileus). 
5.6.2.2. Dose Interruptions for Standard Therapies  
Dose interruptions and adjustments for standard therapy in Part 6 of the study will be at the 
discretion of the investigator, in accordance with the individual product package insert and 
applicable treatment guidelines (eg, NCCN Guidelines).   
CONFIDENTIAL

Protocol  INCB 50465- 101 Am 10 Version 10 07 AUG 2019  
5.6.3. Criteria for Permanent  Discontinuation of  Study Drug  
The occurrence of unacceptable toxicity  will require that the study drug be permanently 
discontinued.  Unacceptable toxicity is defined as: 
• Occurrence of an AE that is related to treatment with the study drug that , in the 
judgment of the investigator or the sponsor' s medical m onitor, compromises the 
subject 's ability to continue study -specific procedures or is considered to not be in the 
subject 's best interest.  
• Toxicity requiring more than 2 dose reductions of INCB050465 or the combination of 
INCB050465 and INCB039110 or the standard therapy.  Subjects enrolled in Part 6 
who require > 2 reductions of the standard therapy may remain on INCB050465 
monotherapy with medical monitor approval. 
• Persistent toxicity requiring a delay of therapy for more than 2 weeks (14 days) , 
except ALT/AST elevation , which may require 4 weeks (28 days) to resolve , unless 
approved by the medical monitor. 
• Prolongation of QTc by >  60 milliseconds or to > 500 milliseconds  confirmed by 
repeat ECG . 
• Recurrent toxicity despite 2 dose reductions. 
If study drug is permanently discontinued, the subject will be withdrawn from the study. 
5.7. Withdrawal of Subjects F rom the Study  
5.7.1. Withdrawal Criteria  
Subjects must  be withdrawn from the study for the following reasons: 
• Further participation would be injurious to the subject' s health or well -being , in the 
investigator's medical judgment. 
• The subject becomes pregnant. 
• Consent is withdrawn. 
• The study is t erminated  by the sponsor. 
• The study is t erminated  by the lo cal health authority or IRB or IEC. 
• Unacceptable toxicity has occurred (see Section  5.6.2.1).  
• Disease progression has occurred (see Appendix D , Appendix E , or Appendix F  for 
definition) except  
− in the circumsta nce where, in the setting of otherwise stable disease, a medical 
procedure or radiation therapy is required to a single lesion, with medical monitor approval, or  
− if progression is observed on a once- weekly schedule after an objective response 
was observed  on a QD schedule, a subject may be returned to the QD schedule if 
it is determined to be in the subject 's best interest by the investigator (eg, no better

Protocol  INCB 50465- 101 Am 10 Version 10 07 AUG 2019  
alternative) and agreed by both the subject and the medical monitor. The subject 
should be withdrawn when a subsequent radiological assessment demonstrates 
further deterioration  or sooner based on clinical signs and symptoms. 
− Note:  Subjects receiving INCB039110 monotherapy study treatment may receive 
combination therapy with INCB039110 and INCB050465 as described in 
Section  4.2.  
A subject  may be withdrawn from the study as follows : 
• If, during the course of the study, a subject is found not to have met eligibility 
criteria, the medical monitor, in collaboration with the investigator, will determine 
whether the subject should be withdrawn from the study.  Refer to Section  11.3, 
Protocol Adherence.  
• If a subject is noncompliant wit h study procedures or study drug administration in the 
opinion of the investigator, the sponsor should be consulted for instruction on handling the subject. 
5.7.2. Withdrawal Procedures  
In the event that the decision is made to permanently discontinue the study drug , the subject will 
be withdrawn from t he study and the end- of-treatment (EOT) visit should be conducted.  
Reasonable efforts should be made to have the subject  return for a follow-up visit.   These visits 
are described in Section  5.10.  The last date of the last dose of study drug  will be recorded in the 
case report form ( CRF ), and the reason for subject withdrawal will be recorded. 
If a subject is withdrawn from the study:  
• The study monitor or sponsor must be notified. 
• The reason(s) for withdrawal mus t be documented in the subject' s medical record and 
in the CRF.  
• The EOT  visit should be performed. 
• Subjects must be followed for safety until the time of the follow -up visit or until 
study drug–related toxicities resolve, return to baseline, or are deemed irreversible, 
whichever is longer. 
5.8. Concomitant Medications and Measures  
All concomitant medications and treatments must be recorded in the CRF.  Any prior medication received up to 30 days before  enrollment (Cycle 1 Day 1) will be recorded in the CRF.  
Concomitant treatments  and/or procedures that are required to manage a subject 's medical 
condition during the study will also be recorded in the CRF.  
5.8.1. Supportive Care Measures  
Supportive care should be administered to subjects as per the i nstitutional policy at the site for 
the standard therapy that the subject will receive.  Additional information may be available in the 
appropriate package inserts.  This includes the use of prophylactic growth factors should be 
CONFIDENTIAL  
Incyte Corporation  Page 59 of 115 
Protocol  INCB 50465- 101 Am 10 Version 10 07 AUG 2019  
based on American Society of Clinical Oncology guidelines for the use of white blood cell 
growth factors (Smith  et al 2006) and the investigator' s clinical judgment.  
5.8.2. Pneumocystis jirovecii  Pneumonia Prophylaxis 
All subjects in this study  are required to receive a standar d PJP prophylaxis regimen determined 
by the investigator.  Examples of standard PJP prophylaxis therapies for this population include trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, atovaquone, dapsone with or without pyrimethamine, and 
pentamidine ( NCCN  2014).  Due to reports of cross -sensitivity between sulfonamides and 
dapsone, all subjects who have a known or suspected allergy to sulfonamides must receive either 
inhaled pentamidine or atovaquone (Mepron
®) for P JP prophylaxis.  Prophylaxis should be given 
while subjects are receiving study treatment and continue for at least  2 to 6 months after the last 
dose of study drug. 
5.9. Restricted Medications  and Measures  
• Use of systemic corticosteroid doses ≤ 10 mg/day prednisone (or equivalent) is 
permitted but discouraged from the screening visit through the EOT  visit.  
• Use of weak or moderate inducers or inhibitors of CYP3A4 ( Appendix G ) is 
discouraged, and investigators should seek other options where possible. 
• P-glycoprotein substrates of clinical relevance should be used with caution  
• Aspirin in doses exceeding 81 mg/day is not permitted.  Low- dose aspirin 
(≤ 81 mg/day) is permitted.  Acetaminophen and nonsteroi dal anti -inflammatory  
agents (NSAIDs, eg, ibuprofen) may be used.  Due to the risk of liver injury with the use of high doses of acetaminophen, subjects should be advised to stay within the recommend daily dose of acetaminophen. 
• If concomitant administration of an anticoagulant/antiplatelet medication is indicated, caution and enhanced monitoring are required.  History of thrombocytopenia and any 
concurrent INCB039110 -related thrombocytopenia should be a factor in the choice of 
anticoagulant and dose.  Aspirin use should be carefully considered because of the 
potential for gastric irritation in subjects with concomitant bleeding risk.  
5.10. Prohibited Medications and Measures  
• Use of potent inducers and inhibitors of CYP3A4 are prohibited ( Appendix G ).  
Based on the low overall bioavailability of topical ketoconazole, there are no 
restrictions on topical ketoconazole. 
• Use of any anticancer medications other than the study medications from 21 days 
before Day 1 through the 30-day follow-up is prohibited. 
• Use of systemic corticosteroid doses > 10 mg/day prednisone (or equivalent) is not permitted from the screening visit through the EOT visit.  
• Any concomitant use of another JAK inhibitor (Part 2 and Part 3 Cohort E only). 
• Admi nistration of live virus vaccines within 30 days of rituximab treatment 
(applicable to Part 6 of the study only).

6.1. Screening Phase  
The screening phase is the interval between the signing of the ICF and the day the subject is 
enrolled in the study (Cycle 1 Day 1).  Informed consent must be obtained before  performing any 
study- specific procedures.  Assessments that are required to demonstrate eligibility may be 
performed over 1 or more days during this phase.  The maximum screening period is 30 days. 
Results from the screeni ng visit evaluations will be reviewed to confirm subject eligibility before 
enrollment/administration of study drug.  Tests with results that fail eligibility requirements may 
be repeated once during the screening phase if th e investigator believes the res ults to be in error 
or not representative.  Additionally, a subject who fails screening may repeat the screening 
process 1 time if the investigator believes there has been a change in eligibility status (eg, after  
recovery from  an infection).   Subjects will be assigned a new subject ID.  
Additionally, the screening phase will be us ed to determine the baseline assessments of clinical 
condition and disease status.  Tumor assessments appropriate to the type of malignancy will be 
performed and recorded in the CR F. 
6.2. Treatment Phase  
The treatment phase begins on the day the subject is enrolled in the study and receives the first 
dose of study drug; this is defined as Cycle 1 Day 1.  Dates for subsequent study visits will be 
determined based on this day and should oc cur within 3  days ( ±) of the scheduled date unless 
delayed for safety reasons.  At Cycle 1 Day 1, results from screening visit evaluations should be 
reviewed to determine if the subject continues to meet the eligibility requirements as specified in 
the Protocol. 
During the treatment phase, regular study visits (physician visits) will occur as described in the 
schedule of assessments for the appropriate part of the study . 
At certain study visits as indicated in  the laboratory assessment tables above, subject s will attend 
the study visit having fasted overnight, having recorded the time of the prior study drug 
administration, and having withheld the morning dose of the study drug.  At these visits, PK  
 sampling will be conducted. 
6.3. End of Treatment  
If a dec ision is made that the subject will withdraw from study participation, the EOT visit 
should be conducted.  If the EOT visit coincides with a regular study visit, the EOT evaluations 
will supersede those of that scheduled visit, and the data should be entered in the EOT visit in the 
CRF.  The subject should be encouraged to return for the follow-up visit. 
6.4. Follow -Up Phase  
The follow-up phase is the interval between the EOT visit and the scheduled follow-up visit, which should occur 30 to 3 7 days after the EOT  visit (or after the last dose of study drug if the 
EOT visit was not performed).  Adverse events and SAEs must be reported up until at least 30 days after the last dose of study drug, until the date of the follow-up visit, or until study drug- related toxicities resolve, return to baseline, or are deemed irreversible, whichever is longer.  
CONFIDENTIAL  

Incyte Corporation  Page 74 of 115 
Protocol  INCB 50465- 101 Am 10 Version 10 07 AUG 20 19 
Reasonable efforts should be made to have the subject return for the follow-up visit, and report 
any AEs that may occur during this phase. 
Subjects are required to remain  on PJP prophylaxis for at least 2 to 6 months after the last dose 
of study drug (see Section  5.8.2) and should be reminded of this at the safety follow-up visit.  
Sites  should follow up with subjects to confirm that the y have been compliant with the 
prophylactic treatment for the duration of this period. 
6.5. Unscheduled Visits 
Unscheduled visits may occur at any time as medically warranted.  Visits where study drug is 
held are considered unscheduled visits.  Any asse ssments performed at those visits should be 
recorded in the CRF.  
6.6. Early Termination  
Not applicable.  
7. CONDUCT OF STUDY ASSESSMENTS AND PROCEDURES  
Required assessments/procedures listed here will be captured on the CRF.  Subjects ongoing 
after implementation o f Protocol Amendment 10 will only have assessments performed as 
indicated in Table 9 and  Table 10 and at a frequency determined by the investigator as guided by 
the standard of care.  Unless noted below, procedures listed in this section are not required to 
be performed or collected on the CRF after implementation of Amendment 10.  
7.1. Administration of Informed Consent Form  
Valid informed consent must be obtained from the study subj ect before conducting any 
study-specific procedures.  The granting of informed consent for study participation must be 
documented in writing using an ICF that contains all of the elements required by ICH E6, and 
describes the nature, scope, and possible consequences of the study in a form understandable to 
the study subject.  Local and institutional guidelines for ICF content and administration must be 
followed; a copy of the signed ICF must be provided to the study subject.  Subjects of childbearing potential must agree to take appropriate measures to avoid pregnancy in order to 
participate in the study ( Appendix A ). 
7.2. Interactive Response Technology Procedure  
Not applicable.  
7.3. Demography, Medical History, Medication Usage  
7.3.1. Demographics and Medical History  
Demographic data and a complete medical and medication history will be collected at screening .  
This will include complete documentation of the history of medical or surgical treatment f or the 
malignancy under study.  Note:  For subjects with DLBCL, the DLBCL subtype (eg, GCB)  
should be known at study entry and will be collected at screening . 
CONFIDENTIAL

Protocol  INCB 50465- 101 Am 10 Version 10 07 AUG 20 19 
7.3.2. Prior/Concomitant Medications  
Prior and/or ongoing medications will be reviewed during screening to determine study 
eligibility and will continue to be recorded throughout the duration of the study.  The medication 
record will be maintained after enrollment as a documentation of concomitant medications, 
including any changes to the dose or regimen.  Prior/concomitant medications include any prescription, over-the-counter, or natural/herbal preparations taken or administered during 
30 days before Cycle 1 Day 1 and throughout the study period. 
Upon implementation of Amendment 10, use of concomitant medications should be monitored to 
verify that subjects are not taking any concomitant medication prohibited per Protocol 
(Section  5.10).  
7.4. Safety Assessments  
Upon implementation of Amendment 10, only s afety assessments (including laboratory analytes)  
that are consistent with standard of care and monitoring should be performed per the investigator's discretion.  Subjects must be taken off study treatment if, in the opinion of the 
investigator, an unacceptable toxicity develops. 
7.4.1. Adverse Events  
Adverse events will be monitored from the time the subject signs informed consent.  Subjects 
will be instructed to report all AEs during the study and subjects will be assessed for the 
occurrence of AEs throughout the study.  In order to avoid bias in eliciting AEs , subjects will be 
asked general, nonleading questions such as "How are you feeling?"  All AEs (serious and 
nonserious) must be recorded on the source documents and CRFs regardless of the assumption of 
a causal relationship with the study drug.  The definition, reporting, and recording requirements for AEs are described in Section  8. 
Upon implementation of Amendment 10, AEs that lead to the discontinuation of study treatment and all SAEs must be recorded in the CRFs, regardless of the assumption of a causal relationship with the study drug(s). 
7.4.2. Comprehensive Physical Examination 
Physical exam ination s must be performed by a medically qualified individual such as a licensed 
physician, Physician 's Assistants, or an advanced Registered Nurse Practitioner, as local law 
permits.  
The comprehensive physical examination will include the following organ or body system 
assessments:  skin; head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat; thyroid; lungs; cardiovascular; abdomen 
(liver, spleen ); extremities, lymph nodes, and a brief neurological examination.  The screening 
physical examination should also include a measurement of height and body weight. 
7.4.3. Targeted Physical Examination 
A targeted physical examination must include a measurement of the subject 's body weight, 
examination of the abdomen (liver, spleen), and evaluation of any AEs or any previously 
reported symptoms or prior physical examination findings.

7.4.4. Vital Signs  
Vital sign measurements (blood pressure, heart rate, and body temperature) will be taken with 
the subject in the recumbent, semirecumbent, or sitting position after 5 minutes of rest. 
7.4.5. Electrocardiograms  
All 12 -lead ECGs will be performed with the subject in a recumbent or semirecumbent position 
after 5 minutes of rest.  The 1 2-lead E CGs will be interpreted by the investigator at the site and 
will be used for immediate subject management.  The decision to include or exclude a subject or 
withdraw a subject from the study based on an ECG flagged as " Abnormal, Clinically 
Meaningful" is the responsibility of the investigator, in consultation with the sponsor' s medical 
monitor, as appropriate. 
7.4.5.1. Timed E lectrocardiograms  
Timed triplicate ( separated b y 5 minut es) ECGs will be  perfor med at Cycle 1 Day 1 and C ycle 1 
Day 15.  ECGs will be conducted predose and will be conducted in conjunction with the 2-hour 
and 4-hour PK timepoints (Section 7.7.1).   ECGs should be conducted before but within 
30 minutes of the PK blood draw at the corresponding timepoint.  The specified postdose 
timepoint may be adjusted based on emerging PK data. 
7.4.6. Laboratory Assessments 
A laboratory local to the study site and subject will perform all clinical laboratory assessments 
for safety.  The investigative site will enter the  laboratory results and laboratory normal ranges 
into the CRF.  Hematology, serum chemistry, and urinalysis should be performed using standard 
procedures on the days indicated in Table 6 and Table  8 where required tests are shown . 
Upon implementation of Amendment 10, laboratory assessments (Table 10 ) only need to be 
performed in accordance with standard of care at each investigational si te and monitor ed as per 
the investigator’s discretion.  Laboratory results do not need to be reported in the CRF, but all 
laboratory results corresponding with an SAE must be reported on the SAE form. 
7.4.6.1. Chemistry  
A panel of serum chemistries will be performe d as indicated in  Table 6 and Table 8; analytes 
required for this panel are listed in  Table 11. 
7.4.6.2. Hematology 
Hematology will be performed as indicated in  Table 6 and Table 8; required analytes are listed in  
Table 11. 7.4.6.3. Urinalysis  
Complete urinalysis will be performed at screening and as indicated in  Table 6 and Table 8; 
required analyses are listed in  Table 11.

Protocol  INCB 50465- 101 Am 10 Version 10 07 AUG 20 19 
7.4.6.4. Coagulation Panel 
A coagulation panel will be run as indicated in Table  6 and Table 8.  Required analytes are listed 
in Table 11. 
7.4.6.5. Fertility Testing  
Female subjects who repo rt being amenorrheic for ≥ 1 year will have FSH tested to confirm 
hormonal menopause; a result of > 30 IU/L will be considered confirmatory.  Female subjects 
must be either confirmed postmenopausal or surgically sterile, OR must be advised on acceptable 
methods that have been determined to be more than 99% effective in avoiding pregnancy 
(Appendix A ). 
7.4.6.6. Pregnancy Testing  
A serum pregnancy test will be required for all female subjects of childbearing potential at screening and follow-up.  P regnancy tests will be conducted only as medically indicated  during 
study treatment. 
7.4.6.7. Hepatitis Screening  
Hepatitis screening assessments  will be performed at the screening visit (Table  6 and Table 8 ) to 
rule out hepatitis infection; required analytes are shown in Table 11.  Additional tests may be 
performed if clinically indicated.  
7.5. Efficacy Assessments  
An objecti ve assessment of disease status is required at baseline (screening) using a method that 
is appropriate for disease subtype, per established and modified guidelines ( Hallek  et al 2008, 
Cheson et al 2014, Cheson et al 2012, Owen  et al 2013).   Disease status will be assessed by the 
site every 9 weeks (3 cycles) after Cycle 1 Day 1  or at a frequency consistent with the standard 
of care for the subject's disease.  For subjects in Part 3 Expansion Cohorts, the sponsor may also have disease status assessed by a central imaging vendor.  
7.5.1. CT Scan or MRI  
Subjects  with applicable disease types  will undergo CT or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI ) to 
evaluate measurable disease during the screening phase.  If CT/MRI assessment was performed under standard of care before  signing of the ICF but within 30 days of Cycle 1 Day 1, the result 
of that assessment may be recorded in the CRF in lieu of a stu dy-specific assessment.  
On-treatment assessments (for subjects with disease measurable by CT or MRI) should be 
performed at least every 9 weeks ( 3 cycles) after  Cycle 1 Day 1  or at a frequency consistent with 
the standard of care for the subject's disease.  Investigators may have subjects assessed for 
response earlier than the every -9-week frequen cy if clinically indicated  in discussion with the 
sponsor. 
Upon implementation of Amendment 10, CT/MRI assessments are only required to be 
performed as per standard of care guidelines and monitor ed.  Subjects must be taken off study if, 
in the opinion of the investigator, the disease has progressed and the subject is no longer having 
clinical benefit from the study treatment.

7.5.2. FDG -PET or Combined PET- CT 
If positron emission tomography (PET) using [18 F] fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) or combined 
PET-CT is used as a functional imaging tool for staging or response assessment of lymphoma as 
a part of the standard of care (eg, in subjects with HL or DLBCL) , the results obtained during 
any study pha se will be captured in the CRF. 
7.5.3. Bone Marrow Examination 
Bone marrow examination is required as a baseline assessment for subjects  with disease subtypes 
that utilize bone marrow histology as part of the objective criteria for disease staging  except in 
the following circumstances or with  approval of the medical monitor: 
• Subject had a bone marrow examination performed as per standard of care prior to 60 days of the first dose of study drug. 
• Subject had a bone marrow examination performed after the last treatment for the 
lymphoid malignancy and the results showed involvement of the bone marrow. 
• Baseline PET scan shows that the subject does have FDG-avid disease in the bone 
marrow (PET + bone marrow). 
Subsequently, bone marrow biopsy will be performed only to confirm CR or as clinically 
indicated.   If the bone marrow does not have lymphoma involvement at baseline, a repeat bone 
marrow exam ination  is not required to confirm indication of CR on imaging. 
Data from t he pathology report result from the bone marrow exam ination  will be captured in the 
CRF.  Results of assessments performed under standard of care before the signing of the ICF  
may be used as the baseline assessment in lieu of a study -specific procedure IF performed within 
60 days of th e first dose of study drug (Cycle 1 Day 1).  
All bone marrow examinations should include a unilateral aspiration and biopsy, when feasible.  
Subjects may be enrolled based on a biopsy only, when a "packed marrow" precludes aspiration.  
An aspiration only ma y be perf ormed at the discretion of the investigator. 
7.5.4. Immunophenotyping  
Immunophenotyping results for all subjects will be collected at baseline.  For subjects with CLL 
or other B- cell malignancy with circulating tumor cells , lymphocyte immunophenotyping 
(Table 6) will be conducted by flow cytometry at the local laboratory at screening and Cycle 2 
Day 1, and at subsequent times only as part of confirmation of CR.  Resul ts will be captured in 
the CRF.  
7.5.5. Immunoglobulin M  Monitoring  
Subjects with WM should have their disease assessed by IgM monitoring of blood serum at 
baseline (C1D1) and at least every 9 weeks for response assessment per the response criteria defined by Owen  et al (2013).  This assessment should be performed locally. 
7.6. Performance Status  
Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status ( Appendix C ) must be assessed by a 
medically qualified ind ividual and recorded in the CRF at visits indicated in Table 5.

7.7. Pharmacokinetic Assessments  
7.7.1. Blood Sample Collection  
Pharmacokinetic samples will be obtained at the visits indicated in Table 6 and Table 8 
(Laboratory Assessments) for all subjects  enrolled in this study; collection times and windows  
are described below.  The exact date and time of the PK blood draws will be recorded in th e CRF 
along with the date and time of the last dose of study drug preceding the blood draw and the time 
of the most recent meal.  Instructions for sample preparation and shipping will be provided in the 
Laboratory Manual.  Subjects will receive reminder ca rds in advance of the study visit providing 
instruction to hold the morning dose of study drug on the day of the visit, and a place to record 
the time of the prior dose of study drug, and time of the most recent meal or snack consumed.  
On Cycle 1 Day 1 , study subjects should have fasted overnight; the clinic visit should be 
scheduled in the morning.  For subjects receiving INCB050465 monotherapy only, a predose PK sample will be taken, followed by administration of the INCB050465 only.  For subjects 
receivi ng the combination with INCB050465, administration  of INCB039110 should be started 
on Day 1 after INCB050465 PK sampling is complete in Part 2 and Part 3 Cohort E.  On Cycle 1 
Day 1 , subjects should arrive at the clinical after  an overnight fast; the clinic visit should be 
scheduled in the morning.  Pharmacokinetic blood samples will be obtained at the times shown 
in 
Table 12. 
On Cycle 1 Day 8  (only for Parts 1, 2, and 3), subjects will refrain from taking study drug in the 
morning before arriving at the research unit.  A trough (predose) PK sample will be taken, followed by administration of the study drug.  Overnight fasting is not required. 
On Cycle 1 Day 15, subjects will refrain from taking the study drug in the morning before 
arriving at the research unit.  Subjects should have fasted overnight; the clinic visit should be scheduled in the morning, and a trough PK sample should be drawn early in the study visit.  The initial schedule for timed postdose samples is shown in 
Table 12. 
In the 15-subject expansion Cohort A , if the dose selected was the MTD in the dose- escalation 
part of the study, on Cycle 1 Day 15 and Cycle 2 Day 1, the dose administered ONLY for these 2 doses will be 1 dose level below the MTD.  I f the PAD is selected for the expansion cohort, 
there will be no alteration to the doses on Cycle 1 Day 15 or Cycle 2 Day 1.

Protocol  INCB 50465- 101 Am 10 Version 10 07 AUG 20 19 
On Cycle 2 Day 1 , study subjects in the expansion Cohort A only will be required to undergo PK 
testing after fed administration o n Cycle 2 Day 1 only. 
• PK testing conducted on Cycle 2  Day 1 wi ll be similar to that on Cycle 1 Day 15 in 
respect to the timing of sample collection and evaluations.  Subjects may be excused 
from the food- effect portion of the study if they are unable to consume the meal or 
feel they are unable to consume the meal.  
• Subjects receiving INCB0 50465 in the fed state will have been fasted from food (not 
including water) overnight for at least 8 hours.  A standardized high-fat, high- calorie 
breakfast will be given to these subjects approximately 30  minutes before 
administration of study drug .  Subjects must consume the entire breakfast within 
25 minutes , and study drug administration  will begin 5  minut es after completing 
breakfast.  
• The high-fat, high- calorie breakfast (50% kcal from fat) will consist of:  
− 2 eggs fried in butter 
− 2 strips of bacon 
− 1 English muffin with butter  
− 4 oz hash brown potatoes 
− and 8 oz whole milk 
• Alternative menus with the same caloric and fat content may be substituted with the 
prior approval of the study sponsor. 
For fasting subjects, a single dose of the study medication will be taken with 240 mL of water.  Subjects will remain fasting and sitting or semirecumbent for 3 hours postdose, after which point a meal may be served.  Subjects will abstain from water for 1 hour postdose. 
Adjustments to the timing of blood sampling postdose may be made based on emerging PK data; 
however, no more than 8 postdose timepoints will be used, and the maximum scheduled 
timepoint will be no greater than 12 hours postdose.  If possible, food should be withheld until 
1 hour af ter study drug administration .   
  Subjects  
who meet criteria in Section  5.6.1 for intrasubject dose escalation must agree to perform full PK 
sampling during the first cycle treated at the higher dose level on Day 15. 
7.7.2. Urine Sample Collection  
Urine will be collected from each subject o n Cycle 1 Day 15  after morning dose and a predose 
void.  A complete urine output collection will be collected from hour 0 ( after morning dose) 
through  8 hours after the first dose of study drug or through 12 hours after the morning dose if a 
12-hour postdose PK sample is being performed .  The time  period and cumulative volume will 
be recorded and 2 aliquots will be provided to the sponsor according to the instructions provided 
in the Laboratory Manual.  Urine output will be stored under refrigeration (5ºC) during the collection interval.

7.7.3. Bioanalytical Methodology and Analysis 
The plasma and urine samples will be analyzed  for INCB050465 and INCB039110 by a 
validated assay and will be collected from  all subjects enrolled in this study.  
 
 These samples will be analyzed by Incyte Corporation 
(Wilmington, DE) or its designee.  
For each subject who completes study participatio n, PK parameters will be calculated from the 
plasma concentrations of INCB050465 and INCB039110 according to the model independent 
approach.  Refer to Appendix B  for a detailed list and description of the PK parameters.  
7.7.4. Pharmacokinetic Analysis 
The PK calculations will be performed, if appropriate, using commercial software such as WinNonlin
® (Pharsight Corporation, Mountain View, CA ).  Nominal times will be used in all 
cases, except when the difference between th e actual time and nominal time is > 5 minutes for 
samples collected up to 4 hours after administration and greater than 15 minutes for samples collected more than 4 hours after administration; in these cases, actual time will be used for PK analysis.  Additional details of analyses will be described in the Statistical Analysis Plan .

7.10. Other Study Procedures  
7.10.1. Drug Administration 
After  implementation of Amendment 10, subjects will be dispensed the appropriate amount of 
medication to self -administer study drug as per protocol until their next scheduled visit 
(scheduled no more than 12 weeks later).  Subjects will continue to self- administer study 
medication , and compliance will continue to be assessed for INCB0 50465 and INCB039110.  
7.10.1.1. Administration of INCB0 50465 
Based on emerging PK and food- effect data ( see Section  1.2.4 and the INCB050465 IB), 
subjects will self -administer INCB0 50465 tablets  orally with water  without regard to food, as 
directed by the i nvestigator.  For  QD or once- weekly intervals, INCB050465 should be taken , at 
approximately the same time each day .*  If BID doses are used, INCB0 50465 should be taken 
morning and e vening at ap proximately 12-hour intervals. 
* NOTE:  Updated advice will be provided if emerging PK and food- effect data suggest that 
an improved PK profile may be achieved by administering INCB050465 with food or if food 
does not have a significant effect on the INCB050465 PK . 
INCB0 50465 will be administered in the study clinic on days indicated in Table 5 and Table 7, 
and in Section  7.7.1.  Subjects will attend the study visit having fasted overnight (for Cycle 1 
Day 1 and Cycle 1 Day 15 for all subjects  and also at Cycle 2 Day 1 for subjects  participating in 
the food- effect study in Part 3 Expansion Cohort A), recorded the time of the prior 
administration of INCB050465 and time and content of prior meal, and having withheld the morning dose of INCB050465.  At this visit, PK  sampling will be conducted. 
7.10.1.2. Dispens ing of INCB0 50465 
An initial bulk supply of INCB050465 tablets  will b e provided to investigative sites before  
enrollment of the first subject.  Thereafter, the site staff will contact the sponsor for resupply of 
INCB0 50465.  When dispensing to subjects, the investigator or designee will remove the 
appropriate quantity of IN CB050465 from their stock, dispense the medication, and enter the 
amount dispensed into the eCRF and drug accountability log.  Full details will be provided in the 
Pharmacy Manual.  
7.10.1.3. Assessment of Compliance With INCB0 50465 
The study subject will return to t he clinic with full, empty, and partially full bottles of 
INCB0 50465 tablets  at the beginning of each treatment cycle or at routine visits or every 
12 weeks or as defined by standard of care, and a compliance check (tablet count) will be 
performed by the clinic staff .  Appropriate steps should be taken to optimize compliance.  
7.10.1.4. Administration of INCB039110 
Subjects will self -administer INCB039110 orally, with water, according to a QD regimen as 
directed by the investigator.  INCB039110 should be taken on an e mpty stomach if possible

(refrain from food consumption during the period 2 hours before and 1 hour after INCB039110 
administration) and can be administered  at the same time as INCB050465.  INCB039110 should 
be administered in the morning. 
INCB039110 will be administered in the study clinic as indicated in Table  5; subjects will attend 
the study visit having fasted, recorded the time of the prior administration of INCB039110 and 
prior meal, and having withheld the morning dose of INCBC039110.  At this visit, PK  
sampling will be conducted.  INCB039110 dos e administration  will be started on Cycle 1 Day 1 
after INCB050465 PK sampling is complete. 
7.10.1.5. Dispensation of INCB039110 
For subjects enrolled in either Part 2 or Part 3 Expansion Cohort E, an initial bulk of 
INCB039110 will be provided to investigative sites prior to enrollment of the first subject.  
Thereafter, the site staff will contact the sponsor for resupply of INCB039110.  When dispensing 
to subjects, the investigator or designee will remove the appropriate quantity of INCB039110 
from their stock, dispense the medication, and enter the amount dispensed into the CRF and drug accountability log.  Full details will be provided in the Study Manual. 
7.10.1.6. Assessment of  Compliance With INCB039110 
For subjects enrolled in either Part 2 or Part 3 Expansion Cohort E the study subject will return 
to the clinic with full, empty, and opened/partially used bottles of INCB039110 at the beginning 
of each treatment cycle or at rou tine visits or every 12 weeks or as defined by standard of care, 
and a compliance check (tablet count) will be performed by the clinic staff .  Appropriate steps 
should be taken to optimize compliance. 
7.10.1.7. Sourcing and Administration of Standard of Care Agents  
The standard of care agents described above will be supplied by the site.  These agents are all 
administered by intravenous infusion in clinic. 
7.10.1.8. Assessment of Compliance With Standard of Care Agents  
The site will document the amount of infusion administered  to the subject  at each appropriate 
visit.  This information  will be captured in the eCRF.  
7.10.1.9. Administration of Supportive Care 
Supportive care, including GCSF for treatment of chemotherapy-induced neutropenia, will be 
supplied by the institution 's pharmacy and administered according to the package insert and 
institutional guidelines.  
7.10.2. Distribution of Subject Reminder Cards /Subject Diaries  
Subjects will be provided with subject reminder cards at each visit.  The subject reminder cards will indicate the date and  time of the next visit.  Reminder cards will include instructions specific 
for Day 8 and Day 15 study visits, at which time the subject will refrain from taking the study 
drug at home in the morning before  the clinic visit.  All necessary instructions, su ch as  
administration  instructions for study drug, concomitant medications, and reminders of visits to 
conduct laboratory tests, should be provided to the subject in writing on this reminder card, or on 
CONFIDENTIAL

Protocol  INCB 50465- 101 Am 10 Version 10 07 AUG 20 19 
accompanying written materials.   Subject diaries will be provided for the purpose of 
documenting study drug administration and AE s.  The subject diary will have an area on which 
the date and time of the last dose taken before each visit will be recorded as well as the time  (and 
content if applicable to the vi sit) of the last meal.  
After implementation of Amendment 10, subjects will receive reminder cards  that will include 
the date and time of the next visit and instructions for study treatment administration . 
8. SAFETY MONITORING AND REPORTING  
8.1. Adverse Events  
8.1.1. Definitions and Reporting  
For the purposes of this Protocol, a n AE is defined as the appearance of (or worsening of any 
pre-existing) undesirable sign(s), symptom(s), or medical condition(s) that occur after a subject  
provides informed consent.  Abnormal laboratory values or test results occurring after informed 
consent constitute AEs  only if they induce clinical signs or symptoms, are considered clinically 
meaningful, require therapy (eg, hematologic abnormality that requires transfusion), or require 
changes i n the study drug(s).  
Adverse events  that begin or worsen after informed consent should be recorded on the Adverse 
Events page  of the CRF.  Conditions that were already present at the time of infor med consent 
should be recorded on the Medical History page of the CRF.  Adverse event monitoring should 
be continued for at least 30 days after the last dose of study drug .  Adverse events (including 
laboratory abnormalities that constitute AEs) should be described using a diagnosis whenever 
possible rather than  by individual underlying signs and symptoms.  When a clear diagnosis 
cannot be identified, each sign or symptom should be reported as a separate AE . 
Adverse events will be assessed according to the CTCAE version 4.03.  The CTCAE severity 
Grade 5 (death) will  not be used in this study; rather, information about deaths will be collected 
as an outcome of the event.  The occurrence of AEs should be sought by nondirective 
questioning of the subject during the screening process after signing the ICF and at each vis it 
during the study.  A dverse events may also  be detected when they are volunteered by the subject 
during the screening process or between visits, or through physical examination, laboratory test, or other assessments.   
As far as possible, each AE should be evaluated to determine:  
• The severity grade (CTCAE Grade 1 to  4). 
• Reasonable possibility that the AE is related to the study treatment:  unrelated (no) or 
related (yes).  
− NOTE: for subjects receiving combination therapy, causality assessment for 
each agen t administered per study must be indicated. 
• Start and end dates, unless unresolved at final exam ination . 
• Action taken with respect to study drug  (eg, none, dose adjusted, temporarily 
interrupted, permanently discontinued, unknown, not applicable). 
CONFIDENTIAL  
Incyte Corporation  Page 86 of 115 
Protocol  INCB 50465- 101 Am 10 Version 10 07 AUG 20 19 
• Outcome (eg, not recovered/not resolved, recovered/resolved, recovering/resolving, 
recovered/resolved with sequelae, fatal, unknown). 
• Whether it is serious, as per serious adverse event (SAE ) definition provided in 
Section  8.3.1. 
Unlike routine safety assessments, SAEs are monitored continuously and have special reporting 
requirements, see  Section  8.3.2. 
All AEs should be treated appropriately.  If a concomitant medication or no ndrug therapy is 
given, this action should be recorded on the AE and Prior/ Concomitant medications  pages of the 
CRF . 
Once an AE is detected, it should be followed until it ha s resolved  or until it is judged to be 
permanent;  assessment should be made at  each visit (or more frequently if necessary) of any 
changes in severity, the suspected relationship to the study drug, the interventions required to 
treat it, and the outcome. 
Disease progression should not be regarded or reported as an AE  itself , unless it is associated 
with a separate AE. 
Upon implementation of Amendment 10, AEs leading to treatment discontinuation and all SAEs 
regardless of causal relationship must be reported on the AE CRF. 
8.2. Laboratory Test Abnormalities  
8.2.1. Definitions and Reporting  
Laboratory  abnormalities that constitute an AE in their own right (are considered clinically 
meaningful, induce clinical signs or symptoms, require concomitant therapy, or require changes in study drug ), should be recorded on the AE page of the CRF.  Whenever possible, a diagnosis 
rather than a symptom should be provided (eg, anemia instead of low hemoglobin).  Laboratory 
abnormalities that meet the criteria for AEs should be followed until they have returned to 
normal or an adequate explanation of the abnormality is found.  When an abnormal laboratory 
test result corresponds to a sign or symptom of a previously reported AE, it is not necessary to 
separately record the lab oratory test result as an additional event.  
Laboratory abnormalities  that do not meet the definition of an AE  should not be reported as AEs .  
A Grade 3 or 4 (severe) AE, as per CTCAE , does not automatically indicate an SAE unless it 
meets the definition of serious, as defined in Section  8.3.1, and/or per the investigator' s 
discretion.  A dose interruption or adjustment for the lab oratory abnormality may be required 
(see Section  5.6) and should not contribute to the designation of a laboratory test  abnormality as  
an SAE .

8.3. Serious Adverse Events  
8.3.1. Definitions  
A SAE is defined as an event that meets 1 of the following criteria : 
• Is fatal or life -threatening (ie, immediate risk of dying) . 
• Results in persistent or significant disability  or incapacity . 
• Constitutes a congenital anomaly  or birth defect . 
• Is clinically meaningful  (ie, defined as an event that jeopardizes the subject or 
require s potential medical or surgical intervention to prevent 1 of the outcomes listed 
above).  Considered meaningful by the investigator a s an imp ortant medical event  
that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require hospitalization, but may be 
considered a SAE  when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, it may jeopardize 
the subject  or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent 1 of the 
outcomes listed in this definition.  
• Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, unless 
hospitalization is a result of : 
− Routine treatment or monitoring of the studied indication  not associated with any 
deterioration in condition 
− Elective or preplanned treatment for a pre -existing condition that is unrelated to 
the indication under study and has not worsened si nce signing the  ICF. 
− Treatment on an emergency outpatient basis for an event not fulfilling any of the 
definitions of a SAE given above and not resulting in hospital admission. 
− Social reasons and respite care, in the absence of any deterioration in the subject 's 
general condition . 
− Any SAEs that are expected due to the condition being treated, including if the SAE is a primary outcome measure, or where  there has been a clear agreement 
with regulators not to consider these as SAEs, provided the information is 
collected elsewhere. 
8.3.2. Reporting  
To ensure subject safety, every SAE, regardless of suspected causa lity, occurring after the 
subject has signed  the ICF  and up to the last study visit, or up to 30 days after the subject has 
stopped study treatment, whichever is later , must be reported to the sponsor (or designee) within 
24 hours of learning of its occurr ence.  Any SAEs experienced after this period should be 
reported to the sponsor ( or designee) only if the investigator suspects a causal relationship to the 
study drug.  Recurrent episodes, complications, or progression of the initial SAE must be 
reported as the follow-up to the original episode within 24 hours of the i nvestigator receiving the 
follow-up information.  An SAE occurring at a different time interval or otherwise considered 
completely unrelated to a previously reported one should be reported separately as a new event.   
CONFIDENTIAL  
Incyte Corporation  Page 88 of 115 
Protocol  INCB 50465- 101 Am 10 Version 10 07 AUG 20 19 
Previously planned ( before providing informed consent) surgeries should not be reported as 
SAEs unless the underlying medical condition worsens over the course of the study. 
Information about all SAEs is collected and recorded on the Serious Adverse Event Report 
Form.   The investigator must assess and record the relationship of each SAE to each specific 
study drug (if there is more than 1), complete the SAE Report Form in English, and send the 
completed, signed form by fax within 2 4 hours to the sponsor or its designee .  The investig ator 
must assess if there is a r easonable possibility that the SAE is r elated to the study treatment:  
unrelated ( no) or related  (yes). 
Serious AEs related to unblinded comparator drugs or concomitant medications/drug delivery systems are reported directly to the manufacturers of those drugs/devices in accordance with the package insert.  
The telephone and facsimile  number of the sponsor's contact persons, specific to the study , are 
listed in the investiga tor folder provided to each site.  The original copy of the SAE Report Form 
and the fax confirmation sheet must be kept with the CRF  documentation at the study site.  
Follow-up information is sent to the same person to whom the original SAE Report Form was sent, using a new SAE Report Form stating that this is a follow -up to the previously reported 
SAE and giving the date of the original report.  Each recurrence, complication, or progression of 
the original event should be reported as a follow-up to that event regardless of when it occurs.  
The follow-up information should describe whether the event has resolved or continues, if and how it was treated , and whether the subject continued or withdrew from study participation, or if 
study drug was interrupted or discontinued. 
If the SAE is not previously documented in the IB for the study drug (new occurrence) and is 
thought to be related to the sponsor' s study drug , a sponsor' s associate may urgently require 
further information from the investigator for reporting to health authorities . 
The sponsor or its designee may need to issue an Investigator Notification (IN)  to inform all 
investigators involved in any study with the same drug that this SAE has been reported.  
Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions (S USARs) will be collected and reported to 
the competent authorities and relevant ethics committees in accordance with Directive 
2001/20/EC, or as per national regulatory requirements in participating countries. 
Upon implementation of Amendment 10, all SAEs regardless of causal relationship will be 
reported as described above. 
8.4. Emergency Unblinding of Treatment Assignment  
Not applicable.  
8.5. Pregnanc y 
Pregnancy, in and of itself, is not regarded as an AE unless there is suspicion that study drug may 
have interfered with the effectiveness of a contraceptive medication or method.  When a 
pregnancy has been confirmed, the following procedures should occur: 
• The i nvestigator must notify the sponsor or its designee immediately . 
• The s tudy drug must be discontinued immedia tely. 
CONFIDENTIAL  
Incyte Corporation  Page 89 of 115 
Protocol  INCB 50465- 101 Am 10 Version 10 07 AUG 20 19 
• The subject must be withdrawn from the study. 
• The EOT  visit evaluations  must be performed. 
• The i nvestigator must complete and submit the Pregnancy Initial and Follow -Up 
Report forms to the sponsor or its designee.  
• A serum pregnancy test must be performed to confirm the urine pregnancy test result.  
(The serum test should be performed at the investigative site to ensure the test will be 
performed promptly and the result available immediately for review.) 
If a negative serum test does not confirm the urine pregnancy test result, then: 
• The investigator will use his or her expert judgment, based on an assessment of the 
potential benefit/risk to the subject, to determine if it is in the subject' s best interest to 
resume study drug and continue participation in the study. 
To ensure subject safety, each pregnancy in a subject during maternal or paternal exposures to study drug  must be reported within 24 hours of learning of its occurrence.   
Data on fetal outcome and breastfeeding are collected for regulatory r eporting and drug safety 
evaluation.  Follow-up to each pregnancy should be conducted to determine outcome, including spontaneous or voluntary termination, details of the birth, and the presence or absence of any 
birth defects, congenital abnormalities, or maternal and/or newborn complications, by following 
until the first well- baby visit.  Pregnancy should be recorded on a Clinical Study Preg nancy 
Form and reported by the investigator to the sponsor or its designee.  Pregnancy follow-up 
should be recorded on the same form and should include an assessment of the possible relationship to the sponsor' s study drug of any pregnancy outcome and follow-up to the first 
well-baby visit.  Any SAE experienced during pregnancy must be reported on the SAE 
Report Form an d to the sponsor or its  designee. 
8.6. Warnings and Precautions  
No evidence available at the time of the approval of this study P rotocol indicated that special  
warnings or precautions were appropriate, other than those noted in the provided IB.  Additional 
safety information collected between IB updates will be communicated in the form of 
Investigator Notifications  (INs) .  Any important new safety information should be discussed with 
the subject during the study as needed.  If new, significant risks are identified, they will be added 
to the ICF. 
8.7. Data Monitoring Committee  
A formal Data Monitoring Committee will not be used for this study.  The sponsor will 
continuously monitor safety through frequent contact with the treating investigators, review of the clinical data, and  formal study meetings.  Routine teleconferences will be held among 
participating study sites  to provide subject -by-subject updates on current study status, interim 
toxicities reported , and any other pertinent information.  A dverse event  and labor atory data 
entered into the clinical database will be reviewed periodically for trends and evolving safety 
signals.  Lastly, formal review meetings will be conducted with investigators during the study to 
establish consensus on the safety and tolerability of a given dose.

8.8. Adverse Events of Special Interest  
INCB050465 is a potent and selective PI3Kδ inhibitor, which is a key target in the BCR survival 
pathway in normal and malignant B-lymphocytes.  In animal studies, lymphoid depletion was 
observed and may also occur in humans.  This may result in infections, fever, or cytokine release 
resulting in fever, chills, hypotension, wheezing, and/or rash.  Reversible minimal to mild hypospermatogenesis was observed in rats at doses that exceed the intended starting clinical dose 
and anticipat ed therapeutic dose in humans.  For additional information on the risks of treatment 
with INCB050465 and INCB039110, see Section s 1.2.3, 1.3.5, and 1.4.4.  
8.9. Product Complaints  
The sponsor collects product complaints on study drugs and drug delivery systems used in 
clinical studies in order to ensure the safety of study participants, monitor quality, and facilitate 
process and product improvements. 
All product complaints associated with material packaged, labeled, and released by the sponsor 
or its designee will be reported. 
The investigator or his/her designee is responsible for reporting a complete des cription of the 
product complaint and any associated AEs via email or other written communication to the 
Incyte contact . 
If the i nvestigator is asked to return the product for investigation, he/she will return a copy of the 
product complaint communication  with the product. 
9. STATISTICS  
9.1. Study Population s 
The populations to be analyzed include the following: 
• Intent -to-treat (ITT) population/ safety population:   Subjects enrolled in the study 
who received at least 1 dose of INCB050465, INCB039110, rituximab, ifos famide, 
carboplatin, and/or etoposide. 
• Per-Protocol (PP) population:   Subjects in the ITT /safety  population who are 
sufficiently compliant with the Protocol.  Details will be provided in the SAP.  
• PK population:   Subjects  in the ITT/safety population who had PK data. 
The ITT/safety population will be used for the summary of baseline, disposition, efficacy, and 
safety analyses.  The PP population may be used in the sensitivity analysis of efficacy endpoints.  
The PK population will be used in the summary of all PK data.  
9.2. Selection of Sample Size  
The total sample size estimate  is up to approximately 150 subjects in this study.  Approximately  
20 subjects  will be enrolled  in Part  1 monotherapy dose escalation, and approximately 
12 subjects will be enr olled in Part 2 combination dose escalation.  Expansion Cohort A will 
enroll between 15 and 30 subjects, and Cohorts B, C, D, and E will enroll up to 15 subjects each.  
CONFIDENTIAL  

Incyte Corporation  Page 91 of 115 
Protocol  INCB 50465- 101 Am 10 Version 10 07 AUG 20 19 
In Part 6, up to 12 subjects will be enrolled in  the safety evaluation followed by an expansion 
cohort of up to15 subjects.  The exact number of subjects treated will depend on the number of 
subjects required per dose level and the number of dose levels studied.  During the 3 + 3 dose 
escalation  in Part 1 and Part 2, the probabilities of dos e escalation from that dose level for 
various DLT rates are given in Table 13. 
Table 13: Probability of Dose Escalation for Specific Dose-Limiting Toxicity Rates 
During 3 + 3 Dose Escalation 
True DLT Rate  Probability of Dose Escalation 
10% 90.6% 
20% 70.9% 
30% 49.4%  
40% 30.9%  
50% 17.2%  
60% 8.2% 
Note that if escalation occurs at the highest dose level during the study, then the MTD is at or above the last dose level.  If th e study stops at the first dose, then the MTD is below the first dose 
level.  In either of these cases, the prescribed doses may need to be altered in order to determine 
the MTD.  
In the expansion cohorts the evaluation of 15 subjects, each will provide a ≥ 90% chance of 
identifying a toxicity with a true event rate of 15%.   
9.3. Level of Significance  
No hypothesis is being tested in the study.  All CIs will be 95% . 
9.4. Statistical Analyses  
9.4.1. General Methodology 
Unless otherwise noted, SAS® softw are (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC; Version 9 or later) will be 
used for the generation of all tables, graphs, and statistical analyses.  Descriptive summaries for continuous variables will include, but not be limited to, the number of observations, mean, 
standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum.  Descriptive summaries for categorical 
variables will include the number and percentage of subjects in each category. 
Data will be summarized overall and by treatment cohorts based on the dose regimen initially 
assigned.  In the event that several dose regimens tested are deemed substantially below the MTD, these doses may be combined for summary purposes. 
9.4.2. Efficacy  Analyses 
The efficacy endpoints will be analyzed using the ITT and the PP populations. 
Response status per investigator 's assessment will be categorized at each response assessment 
visit as  CR, very good partial response (VGPR; only among subjects with WM), partial response 
(PR), minor response (MR; only among subjects with WM), stable disease (SD), progressive 
CONFIDENTIAL

disease, or not evaluable (NE) per published criteria for lymphoma ( Cheson  et al 2014, 
Owen  et al 2013 for WM) and CLL ( Hallek  et al 2008 , Cheson et al 2012).  In the unlikely 
situation that the subject does not have any disease at baseline, the best response will be denoted 
as no disease (ND).  
Best overall response is the best response recorded during the study treat ment before and 
including the first progressive disease, in the order of CR, PR, SD, progressive disease , NE, and 
ND. 
A subject is considered an objective responder if they have a best overall response of CR or PR  
for lymphoma or CR, VGPR, PR, or MR for WM .  The ORR is the proportion of objective 
responders.  Subjects who do not have sufficient baseline or on- study response assessment 
information to be adequately assessed for response status will be included in the denominators in 
the calculation of ORR.  O RR will be estimated with 95% CI , which will be calculated based on 
the exact method for binomial distributions.  B est overall response will also be summarized.  
For subjects with CLL, changes in peripheral blood leukemic cells from baseline to each post-treatment assessment will be summarized with mean, median, standard error, and 95% CIs. 
For subjects with measurable lesions, target lesion sizes will be measured by sum of product of 
diameters (SPD).  The best percent change from baseline, defined as the largest decrease in SPD 
during study will also be summarized, and a waterfall plot of best percent change will be 
generated.  Note that for subjects who only have increases in SPD from baseline, the smallest increase will be considered as the best change from baseline.  
9.4.3. Safety  Analyses 
The clinical safety data (vital signs, ECGs, routine laboratory tests, physical examinations, and AEs) will be summarized using descriptive statistics (eg, mean, frequency) using the safety population. 
Summary tables may  be replaced with listings when appropriate.  For instance, an AE frequency 
table may be replaced with a listing if it only contains a few unique preferred terms reported on 
CONFIDENTIAL  

Incyte Corporation  Page 93 of 115 
Protocol  INCB 50465- 101 Am 10 Version 10 07 AUG 20 19 
relatively few subjects.  Unless otherwise stated, table summaries will be limited  to AEs  
occurring within 30 days of the last administration of study medication . 
9.4.3.1. Adverse Events  
A treatment -emergent AE (TEAE) is any AE either reported for the first time or worsening of a 
pre-existing event after first dose of study drug.  Analysis of AE s will be limited to TEAEs, but 
data listings will include all AEs regardless of their timing to study drug administration.  
Unresolved missing onset date, causality, or severity will be handled according to the following 
rules:  
• An unresolved missing causal ity will be considered treatment- related.  
• An unresolved missing severity will be identified as an unknown severity. 
• A unresolved missing onset date will be considered treatment-emergent, with the 
following examples illustrating exceptions: 
− If the stop/resolution date is before  the first dose date on Day 1, then the AE will 
be considered as not being treatment- emergent.  
− If both the month and day are missing, and the last day of the year is before the 
first dose date on Day 1, then the AE will not be consider ed treatment -emergent.  
− If only the day is missing, and the last day of the month is before the first dose 
date on Day 1, then the AE will not be considered treatment- emergent.  
− If only the day is missing, and the first day of the month is after the first do se date 
on Day 1, then the AE will be considered treatment- emergent.  
Adverse events will be coded to system organ class and preferred term using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA
®) coding dictionary.  Severity of AEs will be 
based on the NCI CTCAE version 4.03. 
The s ubset of AEs considered by the investigator to have a relationship to study drug will be 
considered to be treatment- related AEs.  If the i nvestigator does not specify the relationship of 
the AE to study drug, the AE will b e considered to be treatment -related.  
The number of subjects with DLTs during the first cycle of study medication and the type of 
DLT will be listed . 
An overall summary of AEs will include number (%) of subjects reporting any TEAEs, any DLTs in Cycle 1 , any SAEs, any Grade 3 or 4 TEAEs, any treatment -related TEAEs, any fatal 
TEAE, any TEAEs leading to dose interruption/reduction/discontinuation, and any TEAEs 
leading to study discontinuation. 
Number (%) of subjects reporting any TEAEs, any SAEs, any Grade 3 or 4 TEAEs, any 
treatment -related TEAEs, any treatment -related SAEs, any treatment -related Grade 3 or 4 
TEAEs, any fatal TEAE, any TEAEs leading to dose interruption/reduction/discontinuation, and any TEAEs leading to study discontinuation will be tabulat ed by system organ class and 
preferred term .  Number (%) of subjects reporting any TEAEs and any treatment- related TEAEs 
will be tabulated by preferred term  in decreasing order of frequency in the overall column, and 
by system organ class, preferred term,  and maximum severity .

9.4.3.2. Clinical Laboratory Tests 
The SI unit will be  used for all laboratory tests. 
Laboratory test values outside the normal range will be assessed for severity based on the normal 
ranges for the clinical reference laboratory.  The incidence of abnormal laboratory values and 
shift tables relative  to baseline will be tabulated.  
Laboratory data will be assessed for severity based on NCI  CTCAE version 4.03.  For specific 
laboratory parameters requiring clinical intervention to grade, the classification according to the quantitative component will be provided. 
For numeric laboratory values, baseline value, postbaseline value, change from baseline, and 
percent change from baselin e will be summarized by visit.  
Shift summaries will be presented show ing number and percentage of subjects with the 
laboratory values being low, normal, and high at baseline and at each of the scheduled postbaseline visits.  The denominator for the percentage calculation will use the number of 
subjects in the baseline categ ory (ie, low, high, normal, missing). 
For the laboratory parameters that have CTCAE grading, shift tables will also be presented 
showing change in CTCAE severity grade from baseline to worst grade postbaseline.  Separate 
tables will be provided for selecte d laboratory tests that have grading criteria in both high and 
low directions.  All postbaseline values occurring within 30 days of last dose of study drug will 
be included when summarizing worst postbaseline grade.  The denominator for the percentage 
calculation will be the number of subjects in the baseline category.  
Categorical laboratory data will be tabulated  by visit at baseline and postbaseline visits when 
necessary.  
9.4.3.3. Vital Signs  
Descriptive statistics and mean change from baseline will be determined for vital signs (blood 
pressure, heart rate, and body temperature) at each assessment time.  Criteria for clinically 
notable vital sign abnormalities are defined in Table 14.  The abnormal values for subjects 
exhibi ting clinically notable vital sign abnormalities will be listed.  
Alert vital signs are defined as an absolute value outside the defined range and absolute percentage change greater than 25%.  The abnormal values for subjects exhibiting alert vital sign 
abnormalities will be listed.

9.4.3.4. Electrocardiograms  
Descriptive statistics and mean change from baseline will be determined for each ECG parameter 
at each assessment time.  Average of all values before the first  dose of study drug will be used as 
the baseline value.  Criteria for clinically notable ECG abnormalities are defined in Table 15.  
The abnormal values for subjects exhibiting clinically notable ECG abnormalities will be listed . 
Alert ECG values are defined as an absolute value outside the defined range and absolute 
percentage change > 25% (30% for QRS) interval.  The abnormal values for subjects exhibiting 
alert vital sign abnormalities will be listed . 
Outliers of QT, QTcB , and QTcF, defined as absolute values > 450 milliseconds  or change from

• The PK parameters of INCB050465 and INCB039110 w ill be summarized by 
descriptive statistics by dose group  and cohort.  The log- transformed PK parameters  
of INCB050465 will be compared among the dose levels by using a 1- factor analysis 
of variance (ANOVA) .  Dose -dependent parameters (C max and AUC) will b e 
normalized to the lowest common dose before statistical comparisons.  C max and AUC 
will be evaluated using a power model, eg, AUC = α ∙(doseβ) or equivalently, 
log(AUC) = log(α) + β ∙log(dose), where linear dose proportionality is accepted if β is 
not significantly different from 1.  Attainment of steady state will be assessed separately for each cohort by comparing trough plasma concentrations on Days 8 and 
15 during Cycle 1. 
• For the food- effect  portion of the study, the log- transformed PK parameters of 
INCB050465 will be compared between the fed and fasted treatments using an 
ANOVA for a 1 -way crossover design.  The geometric mean relative bioavailability 
and 90% CI s will be calculated for comparing C
max and AUC between the fed (test) 
and fasted (reference) treatments .

10.3. Accountability, Handling, and Disposal of Study Drug 
Responsibi lity for drug accountability at the study site rests with the investigator; however, the 
investigator may assign some of the drug accountability duties to an appropriate pharmacist or 
other designee.  Inventory and accountability records must be maintained and readily available 
for inspection by the study monitor and are open to inspection at any time by any applicable regulatory authorities.  
The investigator or designee will be expected to collect and retain all used, unused, and partially 
used containers of study drug  until the end of the study.  The i nvestigator or designee must 
maintain records that document: 
• Delivery of study drug to the study site . 
• Inventory of study drug at the site . 
• Subject use of the study drug, including pill or unit counts from each supply 
dispensed. 
• Return of study drug  to the investigator or designee by subjects.  
These records should include dates, quantities, batch or serial numbers (if available), and the 
unique code numbers (if available) assigned to the investigational product and study subjects. 
The investigational product must be used only in accordance with the Protocol.  The investigator 
will also maintain records adequately documenting that the subjects were provided the correct 
study drug specified.  
Completed accountabil ity records will be archived by the site.  At the completion of the study, 
the investigator or designee will oversee shipment of any remaining study drug back to the 
sponsor or its  designee for destruction according to institutional standard operating procedures.  
If local procedures mandate site destruction of investigational supply, prior written approval 
must be obtained from Incyte. 
11. STUDY ADMINISTRATION 
11.1. Data Management  
11.1.1. Data Collection 
The investigator will be provided with a CRF for each subject.  Entries made in the CRF must be 
verifiable against source documents ; any  discrepancies should be explained and documented.  
The investigator will be responsible for reviewing all data and CRF entries and will sign and date 
the designated pages in each subject 's CRF, verifying that the information is true and correct.  
The investigator is responsible for the review and approval of all responses. 
11.1.2. Data Management 
Data management will be performed from CRFs .  All CRF data will be entered into a validated 
database.  All data entry, verification , and validation will be performed in accordance with the 
current standard operating procedures of the Data Management Department at the sponsor or its 
designee.  The database will be authorized for lock once all defined procedures are completed.

Protocol  INCB 50465- 101 Am 10 Version 10 07 AUG 20 19 
11.2. Study Monitoring  
Qualified representatives of the sponsor or its  designee, "study monitors," will monitor the study 
according to a predetermined monitoring plan.  Monitoring visits provide the sponsor with the 
opportunity to: 
• Evaluate th e progress of the study.  
• Verify the accuracy and completeness of CRFs . 
• Assure that all Protocol requirements, applicable laws and/or regulations, and 
investigator' s obligations are being fulfilled . 
• Resolve any inconsistencies in the study records. 
The investigator must allow the study monitors to periodically review, at mutually convenient 
times during the study and after the study has been completed, all CRFs and office, hospital, and 
laboratory records supporting the participation of each subject in the study.  The CRFs and other 
documentation supporting the study must be kept up- to-date by the investigator and the research 
staff at the investigative site.  These study materials must be available for review by the study 
monitor, and/or other qualified repr esentatives of the sponsor or its designee , at each monitoring 
visit.  
The study monitor will review the various records of the study (CRFs, subject medical and laboratory records, and other pertinent data).  The study monitor will verify the CRF data against 
original source documentation for accuracy and completeness.  The study monitor will identify 
data discrepancies and collaborate with the investigator and research staff to resolve the 
discrepancies in a timely manner.  Protocol deviations will also be identified and recorded on a 
"Protocol Deviation Log."  The study monitor will follow an "Issue Escalation " plan in order to 
ensure that each issue identified during a monitoring visit is appropriately documented, reported, 
and resolved in a timely manner in accordance with the plan 's requirements.  
11.3. Protocol Adherence  
The principal investigator must obtain IRB or IEC approval for the inves tigation.  Initial IRB or 
IEC approval and all materials approved by the IRB or IEC for this study including the subject 
ICF and recruitment materials must be maintained by the investigator and made available for 
inspection.

study.  
11.4. Financial Disclosure  
All clinical investigators participating in clinical studies subject to FDA Regulation Title 21  
Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Par t 54 – Financial Disclosure by clinical investigators, are 
required before study initiation to submit a completed clinical investigator Financial Disclosure 
Request Form that sufficiently details any financial interests and arrangements  that apply.  For 
the purpose of this regulation, clinical investigator is defined as any investigator or 
subinvestigator who is directly involved in the treatment or evaluation of research subjects, 
including the spouse and each dependent child of the clinical investigator.  These requirements 
apply to both US and foreign clinical investigators conducting covered clinical studies. 
Any new investigators or subinvestigators added to the covered clinical study during its conduct 
must also s ubmit a completed c linical investigator Financial Disclosure Request Form.  During a 
covered clinical study, any changes to the financial information previously reported by a clinical 
investigator must be reported to the sponsor or its designee.  At the conclusion of the covered 
clinical study, the clinical investigators will be reminded of their obligation to report to the 
sponsor or its designee any changes to the financial information previously reported.  The clinical investigators will also be reminded that they must rep ort any changes in their financial 
information for a period of 1 year after completion of the covered clinical study. 
12. QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE  
12.1. Sponsor Audits  
At some point during the study, individuals from the sponsor 's Quality Assurance depa rtment

APPENDIX A. INFORMATION REGARDING EFFECTIVENESS OF 
CONTRACEPTIVE METHODS  
For Subjects Participating in the Study:  
The following methods that can achieve a failure rate of less than 1% per year when used 
consistently and correctly are considered as highly effective birth control methods.  
Such methods include: 
• Combined (estrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception associated 
with inhibition of ovulation1 
− oral 
− intravaginal  
− transdermal  
• Progestogen -only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation1 
− oral 
− injectable  
− implantable2 
• Intrauterine device (IUD)2 
• Intrauterine hormone- releasing system ( IUS)2 
• Bilateral tubal occlusion2 
• Vasectomised  partner2,3 
• Sexual abstinence4 
 
1  Hormonal  contraception may be susceptible to interaction with the IMP, which may reduce the efficacy of the 
contraception method. 
2  Contraception  methods that in the context of this guidance are  considered to have low user dependency . 
3  Vasectomised  partner is a highly effective method provided of avoiding pregnancy  that partner is the sole sexual 
partner of the WOCBP trial participant and that the vasectomised  partner has received medical assessment of the 
surgical success.  
4  In the context of this guidance, sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if defined as 
refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the study treatments.  The 
reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the duration of the clinical trial and the 
preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject.

 Partial metabolic response:  Partial remission (all of the following):  
Lymph nodes and 
extralymphatic sites  
 • Score 4 or 5a with reduced uptake compared with baseline and 
residual mass(es) of any size.  
 • ≥ 50% decrease in SPD of up to 6 target measurable nodes and extranodal sites.  
• When a lesion is too small to measure on CT, assign 5 mm × 5 mm as the default value.  
• When no longer visible, 0 × 0 mm.  
For a node > 5 mm × 5 mm but smaller than normal, use act ual 
measurement for calculation.

masses, extranodal 
lesions  Score of 4 or 5a with no significant change in FDG uptake from 
baseline at interim or EOT.  < 50% decrease from baseline in SPD of up to 6 dominant, 
measurable nodes and extranodal sites; no criteria for progressive 
disease are m et. 
Nonmeasured lesions  Not applicable.  No increase consistent with progression.  
Organ enlargement  Not applicable.  No increase consistent with progression.

Bone marrow  No change from baseline.  Not applicable.  
 Progressive metab olic disease:  Progressive disease (requires at least one of the following ): 
Individual target 
nodes/nodal lesions  Individual target nodes/nodal lesions:  
• Score 4 or 5a with an increase in intensity of uptake from 
baseline and/or

another etiology (eg, infection, inflammation).  If uncertain 
regarding etiology of new lesions, biopsy or interval scan may 
be considered. 
 
Bone marrow:

• In the setting of splenomegaly, the splenic length must increase 
by > 50% of t he extent of its prior increase beyond baseline (eg, 
a 15-cm spleen must increase to > 16 cm).  If no prior

APPENDIX E.  RESPONSE CRITERIA FOR CLL  
CLL- DEFINITION OF RESPONSE, RELAPSE AND REFRACTORY DISEASE MODIFIED 
FROM IWGCLL ( Hallek  et al 2008, Cheson et al 2012) 
Complete Response (CR)  
CR requires all of the following criteria as assessed:  
1. Absence of clonal lymp hocytes in the peripheral blood. 
2. Absence of significant lymphadenopathy (eg, Lymph nodes > 1.5 cm in diameter) by 
physical examination and in CT scan of the chest abdomen and pelvis. 
3. No hepatomegaly or splenomegaly by physical examination and confirmed by CT scan.  
4. Absence of constitutional symptoms. 
5. Blood counts above the following values: 
a. Neutrophils > 1.5 × 109/L without the need exogenous growth factors. 
b. Platelets > 100 × 109/L without the need for exogenous growth factors. 
c. Hemoglobin > 110 g/L without the red blood cell transfusion or need for 
exogenous erythropoietin. 
6. A marrow aspirate and biopsy should be performed if clinical and laboratory results listed 
in criteria 1 through 5 demonstrate that a CR has been achieved.  The marrow should be 
assessed b y flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry to demonstrate that the marrow is  
free of clonal B -lymphocytes.  If marrow is hypocellular a repeat marrow should be 
conducted in about 4 to 6 weeks provided criteria 1 through 5 are still satisfied. 
Partial Respon se (PR)  
To define a PR , the following parameters need to be documented for a minimum of 2 months 
duration.  Constitutional symptoms persisting for more than 1 month should be recorded. 
1. A decrease in the number of blood lymphocytes by 50% or more from the v alues before 
therapy.  Note:  Persistent lymphocytosis should not interfere with the time of designation 
of a PR, which should be based more on the other measurable aspects of the disease than on lymphocytosis. 
2. Reduction in lymphadenopathy by CT scan as defined by the following: 
a. A decrease in lymph node size by 50% or more in the sum products of up to 
6 lymph nodes or in 1 lymph node diameter if only a single lymph node was present before  therapy.  
b. No increase in any lymph node and no new enlarged lymph node.  In small lymph nodes (< 2 cm) an increase of < 25% is not considered to be significant. 
3. A reduction in the noted pretreatment enlargement of the spleen or liver by 50% or more, 
as detected by CT scan (clinical studies) or palpation (general practice).

4. The blood count should show one of the following: 
a. Neutrophils > 1.5 × 109 /L without the need for exogenous growth factors. 
b. Platelets > 100 × 109 /L without the need for exogenous growth factors 
c. Hemoglobin > 11.0 g/dL without the red blood cell transfusion or need for 
exogenous erythropoietin. 
Progressive Disease*  
Progressive disease during or after therapy is characterized by at least one of the following that is 
confirmed with repeated observations and incorporates indicators of progressive disease  that are 
not typically associated with tumor flare OR rely on indicators of progressive disease that do not 
resolve after use of measures to mitigate the signs or symptoms of tumor flare:  
1. Lymphadenopathy:  
a. Appearance of any new lesion such as enlarged lymph nodes (> 1.5 cm), splenomegaly, hepatomegaly or other organ infiltrates. 
b. An increase by 50% or more in greatest determined diameter of any previous site.  A lymph node of 1 to 1.5 cm must increase by 50% or more to a size greater than 1.5 cm in the longest axis .  A lymph node of more than 1.5 cm must increase to 
more than 2.0 cm in the longest axis. 
c. An increase of 50% or more in the sum of the product of diameters of multiple nodes. 
d. Appearance of new lesio ns such as new lymphadenopathy (> 1.5 cm), 
splenomegaly, hepatomegaly or other organ infiltrates.  
2. An increase in the liver or spleen size by 50% or more or the de novo  appearance of  
hepatomegaly or splenomegaly. 
3. An increase in the number of blood lymphocy tes by 50% or more with at least 
5,000 B-lymphocytes /μL AND at least 1 sign or symptom of disease progression .  
Lymphocytosis alone should not be considered progressive disease. 
4. Transformation to a more aggressive histology (eg, Richter syndrome).  This diagnosis should be established by lymph node biopsy. 
5. Occurrence of cytopenia (neutropenia, anemia or thrombocytopenia) attributable to CLL. 
* Including modified criteria as referenced in Cheson et al 2012. 
Stable Disease 
Patients who have not achieved a CR or a PR and who have not exhibited PD will be considered 
to have stable disease (which is equivalent to a nonresponse).

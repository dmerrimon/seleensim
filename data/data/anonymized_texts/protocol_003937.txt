SUMMARY OF CHANGES  
Unless otherwise noted, the protocol clarifications and revisions stated below were made based on 
discussion with the Invest igators.  
Section 2 ( Synopsis )  
Methodology  
• The following sentences were added:  
"Bupivacaine is preferred as the spinal anesthetic; however, if the spinal fails or cannot be 
completed, the patient may receive general anesthesia.  Total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) is 
then the preferred route.  If TIVA is contraindicated or not prefera ble, then inhalational 
anesthetics may be used.  The use of fentanyl or short -acting analogues will be permitted in 
both groups.     
The following medications will be allowed: 
• Anti-emetics may be used pre- operatively or intra -operatively.  
o Decadron 10 mg x 1 intra -op is permitted  
o Scopolamine patch will be permitted if used as a pre -medication or intra -
operatively but should be removed post -operatively.  
• Lidocaine will be permitted, if used as a local anesthetic at the site of IV placement 
or as IV to stabiliz e heart rhythm.  
• Propofol is permitted for induction and intra -operatively, but not post -operatively.  
• Versed, 1 -2 mg IV, may be used pre -operatively for anxiety or sedation. "

from : " Acetaminophen/paracetamol 1000 mg PO every 8 hours (q8h)"  
to: " Acetaminophen/paracetamol 975 -1000 mg PO every 8 hours (q8h)"  
• The following sentences were added:  
o “If a subject has an allergy to celecoxib, they may use the following alternative drugs: 
naproxen 500 mg PO or meloxicam 7.5 mg PO.

weekly basis throughout the conduct of this study.  The Pacira Study Data Management and 
Biostatistics team will work in conjunction to provide blinded tables, figures , and listings for 
the BDR.  Meeting notes will be compiled and filed at the end of each BDR session. 
The outcome of the BDR process will be the trigger for prompting the Safety Stopping Rules 
based on the incidence rate of all AESIs  including the following:  
• Cardiac AESI s as defined in the protocol including cardiac ar rest, hypertension, and 
hypotension exceeding 10% . 
• Neurologic AESI s as defined in the study protocol including d ysgeusia and oral

• Incidence rate of severe AESI s including c ardiac AESI s and neurologic 
AESI sexceeding 5% . 
• Falls ex ceeding 5% . 
• Dizziness exceeding 25% . 
Unblinded review of the data and a relative risk data analysis will occur if any one of the 
events above should occur.  If the risk relative to placebo  is greater than 2, the next step will 
be any one of the following a ctions:  
• Halt subject  dosing and/or study enrollment until the toxicity data can be further 
reviewed . 
• Revise eligibility criteria to exclude subjects who appear to be more at higher risk for a 
particular AE.  
Any unexplained death will be thoroughly reviewed and appropriate action taken ."

Title of Study : A Multicenter,  Randomized, Double -Blind, Controlled Trial Comparing Local Infiltration 
Analgesia with EXPAREL to Local Infiltration Analgesia without  EXPAREL to Manage Postsurgical Pain 
Following Total Knee  Arthroplasty  
Principal Investigator (s): To be determined  
Study Center(s) : Multicenter study in the US  and Europe  
Publications (R eference) : None  
Objectives:  
Primary Objective : The primary  objecti ve of this study is to compare pain control and total opioid consumption 
following local infiltration analgesia (LIA) with EXPAREL to LIA without EXPAREL in adult subjects 
undergoing primary unilateral total knee arthroplasty (TKA).  
Secondary  Objec tives: The secondary  objecti ves of this study are to compare additional efficacy, safety, and 
health economic outcomes following LIA with EXPAREL to LIA without EXPAREL in adult subjects 
undergoing primary unilateral TKA.  
Methodology :  
This is a Phase 4 , multicenter , randomized, double -blind, controlled trial in approximately 300 adult subjects 
undergoing primary unilateral TKA under spinal anesthesia with bupivacaine HCl (10 -15 mg ). 
Bupivacaine is preferred as the spinal anesthetic; however, if the spinal fails or cannot be completed, the patient 
may receive general anesthesia.  Total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) is then the preferred route.  If TIVA is 
contraindicated or not preferable, then inhalational anesthetics may be used.  The use of fentanyl or short -acting 
analogues will be permitted in both groups.     
The following medications will be allowed:  
• Anti-emetics may be used pre- operatively or intra -operatively.  
o Decadron 10 mg x 1 intra -op is permitted  
o Scopolamine patch will be permitted if used as a pre- medication or intra -operatively but should 
be removed post -operatively.  
• Lidocaine will be permitted, if used as a local anesthetic at the site of IV placement or as IV to stabilize 
heart rhythm.  
• Propofol is permitted for induction and intra -operatively, but not post -operatively.  
• Versed, 1 -2 mg IV, may be used pre -operatively for anxiety or sedation  
Subjects will be screened within 30 days prior to study drug administration.  Durin g the screening visit, which 
must take place at least 1 day prior to surgery, subjects will be assessed for past or present neurologic, cardiac, 
and general medical conditions that in the opinion of  the Investigator would preclude them from study

o If a subject has an allergy to celecoxib, they may use the following alternative drugs: naproxen 
500 mg PO or meloxicam 7.5 mg PO.  
• Pregabalin up to 300 mg, PO. 
On Day 0, all eligible subjects will also receive tr anexamic acid , up to 2 grams (intravenously [IV]),  at the 
beginning of surgery or intra -operatively.  
Subjects will be randomized 1:1 to two treatment groups.  Subjects in Group 1 will receive LIA with EXPAREL 
266 mg in 20 mL  admixed with  bupivacaine HCl 0.5% in 20 mL  and expanded in volume with 80 mL normal 
saline  (total volume of 120 mL) .  Subjects in Group 2 will receive LIA with bupivacaine HCl 0.5% in 20 mL 
expanded in volume with 100 mL normal saline  (total volume of 120 mL) .   
Trained and qualified I nvestigators (see Appendix 5) will use their usual surgical technique to perform the TKA.   
Use of tourniquets and drains, if used, will be recorded.  The case is to be completed at a time that will allow for a 
postsurgical physical therapy assessment on Day 0.  
Subjects  will be required to remain at the hospital facility for a minimum of 48 hours after surgery.   The subjects 
must still complete the 72 -hour assessments if they are discharged from the hospital facility  prior to 72 hours after 
surgery . 
The use of fentanyl or analogues will be permitted (during surgery only) in both groups.   Intraoperative 
administration of other opioids or any other analgesic, local anesthetics, or anti- inflammatory agents will be 
prohibited in both groups, unless needed to treat an AE.  
Study drug will be administered using six  20 cc syringes with 22-gauge needle s prior to wound closure .  Each 
stick should deliver approximately 1 -1.5 cc to the intended area.  The tissue should visibly expand with minimal 
leakage.  S tudy drug should be injected in the prescribed locations based on the areas of highest nerve density.  
Prior to cementation  
• Syringe #1: Posterior capsule ( 8-10 sticks medial and 8 -10 sticks lateral).  
• Syringe #2: Femur −  medial and lateral periosteum, poste rior periosteum, suprapatellar/quadricep s 
tendon (20 sticks).  
• Syringe #3: Tibia −  fat pad ( 5 sticks); pes anserinus, medial collateral ligament, and gutter (15 sticks) . 
• Syringe #4: C ircumferential periosteum (15-20 sticks).  
After cementation  
• Syringe # 5: Midline quadricep s tendon (10 sticks); r etinaculum , medial gutter , femoral to tibia  
(10 sticks ).  
• Syringe # 6: Lateral gutter, femoral to tibial (10 sticks); s ubcutaneous/closure ( 10 sticks).  
In addition to LIA, all study  participants will receive a standardized approach for  managing postsurgical pain that 
includes a scheduled multimodal pain regimen including adjunctive analgesics, non -steroidal anti- inflammatory 
drugs (NSAIDs), and rescue analgesics as needed.  
Postsurgi cally, all subjects will receive  the following  scheduled medications until hospital discharge : 
• Acetaminophen/paracetamol  975-1000 mg PO every 8 hours (q8h).  The  total daily dose is not to exceed 
3000 mg.   
• Celecoxib 200 mg PO every 12 hours (q12h) .

A prewritten order sheet with the schedule d medications  will be given to the nurses for the subjects in this study.  
Postsurgi cal Rescue Medication  
Subjects should only receive rescue medication upon request for pain control, as needed.  Postsurgical rescue 
medication will consist of PO  immediate -release oxycodone initiating up to  10 mg .  The subject may re -dose, per 
physician ju dgment, as needed (PRN), if the initial rescue medication fails.  If a subject cannot tolerate PO 
medication or has repeated f ailure of the resc ue medication with oxycodone (PO), IV morphine (2 .5-5 mg) or 
hydromorphone ( 0.5-1 mg) may be administered q4h  or PRN .  Patient- controlled analgesia (PCA) is not 
permitted .  No other  rescue analgesic agents, including NSAIDs, are permitted until ho spital discharge .  After 
discharge , the analgesic regimen may be adjusted for each subject individually  as deemed appropriate by the 
physician responsible for the postsurgical care.  
Postsurgical Assessments  
Postsurgical clinical assessments will include pain intensity scores using a 10 -cm visual analog scale (VAS)  
(see Appendix 1); overall benefit of analgesia s core (OBAS) questionnaire (see Appendix 2); total postsurgical 
opioid consumption; physical therapy assessment  (see Physical Therapy Assessment Manual ); nurse 's satisfaction 
with overall analgesia (see Appendix 3); and discharge readiness  (see Appendix 4).   
Adverse events will be recorded from the time the ICF is signed through  postsurgical  Day 29.  If  a cardiac AE , 
neurological AE, fall, or serious  AE (SAE) occurs during the study, a  pharmacokinetic ( PK) blood sample should 
be collected  as close as possible to when the event occurs.  Additionally, a 12- lead ECG, vital signs , and any 
appropriate clinical laboratory tests should be conducted  as close as possible to when the event occurs .  For out -
of-hospital events, the medical monitor should be contacted  to determine need for a PK sample and ECG .   
Cardiac AEs of special interest include chest pain (angina, myocardial infarction), abnormal/irregular heart rate (bradycardia, tachycardia, extrasystoles), and shortness of breath requiring intervention.  Neurologic AEs of 
special interest include altered mental status/altered sensorium, rigidity, dysarthria, seizure, trem ors, metallic 
taste, tinnitus, perioral numbness, and visual disturbance.  Additionally, the following events are of special 
interest if they persist or occur beyond 72 -hours postdose: dizziness, hyperesthesia, muscular twitching, and 
tingling/paresthesia.  
Postsurgical health economic outcome assessments will include hospital length of stay (LOS), use of skilled 
nursing facility, outpatient physical therapy use, hospital readmissions, and use of other health services following 
discharge (phone calls related to postsurgical pain, unscheduled visits related to postsurgic al pain, and visits to 
emergency department) through postsurgical Day 29 . 
A follow -up visit will be scheduled for all subjects on postsurgical Day 14.   A follow -up phone call will be made 
on postsurgical Day 29 to all subjects who received study drug to as sess for AEs.  
Number of Subjects (P lanned):  
Approximately  300 subjects ( 150 subjects  per treatment group) are planned  for enrollment in this study  in order 
to have at least 260 evaluable subjects .

Safety Endpoint:  
• Incidence of treatment -emergent AEs (TEAEs) and SAEs through postsurgical Day 29. 
Statistical Methods :  
A comprehensive statistical analysis plan will be developed for this study.   Demographic and baseline 
characteristics will be summarized descriptively by treatment group.   Efficacy data will be summarized by 
treatment group.   Superiority of treatment with EXPAREL (Group 1) versus treatment without EXPAREL 
(Group 2) will be determined using an analysis of variance (ANOVA) with treatment as the main effect on the 
AUC of the VAS  pain intensity scores through 48 hours.   If superiority of pain control is demonst rated, then the 
total opioid use (in morphine equivalent doses) through 48 hours in Group 1 will be compared to that of Group 2 
using an ANOVA.   This hierarchical testing procedure will protect the type 1 error rate.  Secondary efficacy 
endpoints will be a nalyzed using ANOVA, chi -square tests, and log -rank tests, as appropriate.   Safety endpoints 
will be summarized descriptively by treatment group.  
Sample Size   
A sample size of 130 subjects in each group is needed to  have at least 90% power to detect a − 0.3 unit difference 
in the geometric means for total opioid dose assuming the common standard deviation (SD) is 0.670 using a two 
group t -test with a 0.025 two -sided significance level.   A sample size of 78 is needed in each group to have at 
least 90% power t o detect a difference in AUC (12-48)  of the VAS  pain intensity score means of − 40 assuming the 
common SD is 70 using a two group t -test with a 0.025 two -sided significance level.  Three hundred subjects 
(150 per treatment arm) will be randomized into this study in order to have  260 evaluable subjects.

7. INTRODUCTION 
7.1. Indication  
EXPAREL® was developed to provide a prolonged period of decreased pain and decreas ed 
opioid use with a single dose administration without the use of indwelling catheters.  It is 
indicated for use as an analgesic injected into the surgical site for postsurgical pain relief.  
Effective postsurgical pain control is a critical element in pat ient recovery following surgery, 
as the majority of patients  may experience significant pain, particularly in the first few days.  
Improved postsurgical pain management contributes to better healing, faster patient  mobilization, 
shortened hospital stays, and reduced healthcare costs ( American Society of Anesthesiologists 
Task Force on Pain Management 1995).  
7.2. Current Therapies/Treatments  
Current modalities of post surgical  analgesi c treatment include wound infiltration and nerve block 
with local anesthetic ag ents, usually  combined with the systemic administration of analgesics 
(multimodal therapy).  Multimodal therapy usually includes opioid medications, nonsteroidal 
anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAID s), and/or acetaminophen provided through a variety of routes 
including intravenous ( IV), transdermal patch , and oral (PO) administration.  Opioids are widely 
used and considered some of the most powerful analgesics ; however , they also have considerable 
drawbacks including time and resources required for monitoring opi oid-related side effects.  
A reduction in the use of postoperative opioids is desirable to decrease the incidence and severity 
of opioid- induced adverse effects, such as respiratory depression, nausea, vomiting, constipation, 
somnolence, pruritus, and urinary retention.   
Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is a common surgical procedure that causes postsurgical pain of 
considerable intensity and duration.  While the s tandard analgesic medications administered prior 
to the TKA procedure and used to provide analgesic relief immediately after surgery can vary, 
most experts agree that multimodal pain control has become the standard of care .  In TKA, 
that may include local analgesics  (i.e., wound infiltration) combined with acetaminophen and a n 
NSAID  or a cyclooxygenase- 2 selective inhibitor with opioids reserved as rescue analgesics .  
This a pproach has been shown to significantly  reduce opioid requirements and opioid- related 
adverse events ( AEs).  It is clear that opioid -related AEs  increase perioperative morbidity, 
including delay  in ambulation and participation in rehabilitation therapy  programs.  Also, 
analgesic adjuncts, such as dexamethasone (single intraoperative dose)  and gabapentinoids  
(i.e., gabapentin and pregabalin) may provide further benefit  (Joshi 2015) .  Following surgery , 
additional analgesic treatment  often includes opioids.  Therefore, TKA was selected as an 
appropriate pain model for investigating a sustained -release formulation of bupivacaine, which 
has the potential to overcome the limitation reported in previous studies with regard to the duration of the analgesic effect obtained with commercially -available products.  
With over 70 million surgeries performed annually in the US, postoperative pain is a ubiquitous condition among our population.  While it is a predictable component of the postoperative process, such pain is often poorly managed, resulting in clinical and physiological changes that 
increase morbidity and mortality (inability to ambulate early, etc.), diminish quality of life,

and extend length of stay, thereby increasing hospital expenditures ( Oderda 2007) and reducing 
patient satisfaction.  Effective relief of acute pain with minimal opioid complications, on the 
other hand, may improve clinical outcomes, avoid complications (like delay in regaining bowel 
function or an inability to tole rate liquid and solid oral intake, etc.), and conserve healthcare 
resources.  As  such, the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations requires 
that all healthcare facilities practice adequate pain management and monitor opioid -related AE s 
(Apfelbaum 2003 ). 
Opioid analgesics have long been established to be the most effective agents used for the 
management of moderate to severe postoperative pain, and are currently considered the mainstay 
of treatment.  Adverse events related to opioid adm inistration (e.g., nausea, vomiting, ileus, 
confusion), however, represent one important reason that there is a need to develop opioid-
sparing strategies.  Indeed, fear of gastrointestinal side effects such as nausea and vomiting, as 
well as respiratory depression, present major limitations for the widespread use of opioid analgesics ( Chernin 2001 and Viscusi  2009).
  Furthermore, management of opioid- related events 
often requires medical attention (e.g.,  opioid antagonists, antiemetic agents) and increased 
pharmacy/nursing time, which may raise healthcare expenses  (Carroll 1994) .   
7.3. EXPAREL (bupivacaine liposome injectable suspension)  
Bupivacaine is one of the longer -acting local anesthetics, but even so it has a limited duration 
of action after local adminis tration, usually reported as less than 8 hours.  EXPAREL (Pacira 
Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Parsippany, NJ) is a bupivacaine liposome injectable suspension.  It consists of microscopic spherical, multivesicular liposomes (DepoFoam
® drug delivery 
system), organized in a honeycomb- like structure comprising numerous non- concentric internal 
aqueous chambers containing a bupivacaine base at a concentration of 13.3 mg/mL.  Each 
chamber is separated from adjacent chambers by lipid membranes.  The lipids (phospholipids , 
cholesterol, and triglycerides) are naturally occurring or close analogs of endogenous lipids.  
Bupivacaine is slowly released from the DepoFoam particles by a complex mechanism involving 
reorganization of the barrier lipid membranes and subsequent diffusion of the drug over an 
extended period of time.  A small amount of extra -liposomal bupivacaine (i.e., not bound within 
the DepoFoam particles) enables EXPAREL to have a similar onset of action to standard 
bupivacaine  HCl.   Because of this, EXPAREL has been noted in wound infiltration studies to 
have a bimodal curve ( Apseloff 2013), with an initial peak at approximately 0 -2 hours and a 
second peak at approximately 24 -48 hours ( Hu 2013).   
EXPAREL was approved by the US FDA in 2011 for administration into the surgical site to 
produce postsurgical analgesia.  The active  ingredient (bupivacaine) and  inactive ingredient 
(DepoFoam) of EXPAREL are each contained, though separately, in FDA -approved products:  
• Bupivacaine HCl solution, a well -characterized anesthet ic/analgesic, with more than 
35 years of its use in the US. 
• DepoFoam, a liposomal extended- release formulation contained in the marketed product 
DepoCyt® (1999).  The form of DepoFoam used in each of the products – DepoCyt and 
EXPAREL – has a slightly diff erent mixture of lipid components.

7.3.1. Summary of Human Experience with EXPAREL  
7.3.1.1. Wound Infiltration New Drug Application (NDA)  
During the original clinical development program (wound infiltration), Pacira conducted 
21 clinical studies and one observational follow -up study to investigate EXPAREL (formerly 
known as SKY0402™) .  Across these studies, a total of 1307 human subjects received 
EXPAREL  at doses ranging from  10-750 mg (or 9-665 mg  free base) and by various routes : 
local administration into the surgical wound, subcutaneous, perineural, and epidural .  The 
investigational drug product has been well tolerated and the reported AEs occur red at a similar 
rate as the corresponding bupivacaine HCl controls in the active comparator studies.   
In doses up to 665 mg  of EXPAREL , no signal of any of the central nervous system  or 
cardiovascular system AEs observed with high doses of bupivacaine HCl s olution have been 
observed.  Two  thorough QTc studies have been conducted; EXPAREL  did not cause significant 
QTc prolongation even at the highest dose evaluated.   
Across all studies, the types of treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs) reported and the 
incidence rates generally were similar between the EXPAREL  All Doses group (all doses 
combined) and the bupivacaine HCl group.  The  incidence rate for each of the three most 
common TEAEs (nausea, constipation, and vomiting) was lower in the EXPAREL  All Dos es 
group than in the bupivacaine HCl group.   
EXPAREL  was demonstrated to produce statistically significant and clinically meaningful 
analgesia in two pivotal placebo -controlled Phase 3 studies (SKY0402- C-317 and SKY0402-
C-316) involving both orthopedic and soft tissue procedures over 36 and 72 hours, respectively.  
In addition to meeting their primary endpoints ( area under the curve [ AUC ] of the numeric rating 
scale [NRS] at rest [ NRS -R] pain intensity scores through 72 hours [ Study SKY0402- C-316] and 
through 24 hours [ Study SKY0402- C-317]), key secondary endpoints also were met, 
demonstrating prolonged analgesia and reduction of opioid use by various measures (percentage 
of subjects who received no supplementary opioid medication; total amount of postopera tive 
consumption of opioid medication;  and time to first use of opioid medication).  The robust nature 
of the efficacy results in both pivotal studies SKY0402- C-316 and SKY0402- C-317 was 
demonstrated across subgroups of subjects  with various prognostic fea tures and across 
demographic subgroups.   
An analysis was performed to compare the incidence of opioid- related AEs between the 
EXPAREL  and bupivacaine HCl groups in all bupivacaine- controlled, parallel -group wound 
infiltration studies (SIMPLE TKA 311, SKY0402- C-208, SIMPLE Hemorrhoidectomy 312, 
SKY0402- C-209, SKY0402- C-207, SKY0402- C-201, and SIMPLE Breast Augmentation 315).  
There was a statistically significantly lower incidence of opioid -related AEs in the EXPAREL  
≤300 mg group compared to the bupivacaine HCl group through 72 hours postdose.  This was 
consistent with the statistically significantly lower total postoperative consumption of opioids 
in the EXPAREL  ≤300 mg group through 72 hours postdose.  Fewer subjects in the EXPAREL  
≤300 mg group had at le ast one opioid- related AE compared to the bupivacaine HCl group 
(25.6% versu s 45.6%; p<0.0001).  The total opioid medication administered (adjusted geometric 
mean) through 72 hours postdose was statistically significantly lower in the EXPAREL  ≤300 mg 
group (7.94 mg) compared to the bupivacaine HCl group (15.84 mg); p<0.0001.  The EXPAREL  
>300 mg group did not show a statistically significant advantage favoring EXPAREL ; the mean

(standard deviation [ SD]) of the average number of opioid- related AEs per subject was 
0.58 (0.522), and the total opioid medication administered (adjusted geometric mean) through 
72 hours postdose was 22.82 mg in  the EXPAREL  >300 mg group.  
Please see the EXPAREL Full Prescribing  Information  for safety information regarding the u se 
of EXPAREL for the treatment of postsurgical pain in the setting of wound infiltration. 
7.3.1.2. Nerve Block Supplemental NDA  
A total of 335 human subjects received EXPAREL as a nerve block over six clinical studies 
(SKY0402- 002, SKY0402- C-111, SKY0402- C-203, SK Y0402- C-211, 402- C-322, and 402- C-
323) utilizing three different surgical models ( femoral nerve block, intercostal nerve block, and 
ankle nerve block).  Doses administered ranged from 2 mg to 310 mg.  The data from three of these studies (SKY0402- 002, SKY0402- C-203, and SKY0402- C-211) were included in the 
wound infiltration NDA as well as the nerve block supplemental NDA.   
Phase 3 Nerve Block Studies  
Study 402 -C-322 was a Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double -blind, parallel -group, placebo-
controlled st udy to investigate the efficacy and safety of EXPAREL  (total of 266 mg in 20 mL) 
divided into three equal doses in three syringes of approximately 88 mg in 6.6 mL volume per nerve and administered to each of three nerve segments (index nerve, nerve above, and nerve 
below) compared with saline placebo nerve block.  The primary objective was to e valuate the 
efficacy of intercostal nerve block using EXPAREL  compared with placebo in subjects 
undergoing posterolateral thoracotomy.  
Intercostal nerve block with EXPAREL  was well tolerated in subjects undergoing posterolateral 
thorac otomy.  However, the study did not meet its primary efficacy endpoint:  there was no 
statistically significant difference in the mean AUC of the NRS -R pain intensity scores through 
72 hours between subjects in the EXPAREL group and in the placebo group  although a treatment 
effect was evident through 12 to 24 hours based upon a post hoc analysis.  
Fifty -six subjects ( 59.6%) in the EXPAREL group and 46 subjects ( 50.5%) in the placebo group 
experienced one or more TEAEs.  Most of the TEAEs were mild or moderate in severity.  
Three subjects (3.2%) in the EXPAREL group and no subjects in the placebo group experienced a TE AE that were assessed by the Investigator as related to study drug.  Twelve subjects (12.8%) 
in the EXPAREL group and 9 subjects (9.9%) in the placebo group experienced one or more  
treatment -emergent serious AEs ( SAEs ).  Two of these subjects  in the EXPAREL group and 
four of these subjects in the placebo group died.  None of the SAEs or deaths was assessed by the 
Investigator as related to study drug.  Two subjects (2.1%) in the EXPAREL group and seven  
subjects (7.4%) in the placebo group were  withdrawn from the study due to an AE.  
Study 402 -C-323 was  a Phase 2/3, multicenter, randomized, double -blind, parallel -group, 
placebo -controlled, dose -ranging study in subjects undergoing primary unilateral TKA under 
general or spinal anesthesia.  The primary objectives of Part 1 were  to (1) evaluate three dose 
levels of EXPAREL  versus placebo with respect to the magnitude and duration of the analgesic 
effect achieved following single dose injection femoral nerve block with EXPAREL , and 
(2) select a single therapeutic dose of EXPAREL  from the three dose levels to  be tested in Part 2.

EXPAREL®             Clinical Study Protocol Amendment 2 
 
The primary objective of Part 2 was to compare the magnitude and duration of the analgesic 
effect of single injection femoral nerve block of a single dose level of EXPAREL  (selected from 
Part 1) with placebo ( preservative- free normal saline for injection) . 
Femoral  nerve block with EXPAREL  at 67 mg, 133 mg, and 266 mg was well tolerated in 
subjects undergoing TKA .  There were no discernible safety differences across the treatment 
groups.  There was a dose response in EXPAREL -treated sub jects.  A dose of 266 mg was 
selected for Part 2.  
Part 2 of the study met its primary efficacy endpoint: the difference in  the AUC of the NRS -R 
pain intensity scores through 72 hours between the EXPAREL group and the placebo group was statistically significant.  Additionally, the difference in the total postsurgical opioid consumption (mg) through 72 hours between the EXPAREL 266 mg group and the placebo group was 
statistically significant indicating lower opioid consumption in the EXPAREL group.   
In Part 1, there were no discernible safety differences across the treatment groups.  In Part 2, 
the incidences of TEAEs and treatment -emergent SAEs were similar between the EXPAREL 
266 mg group and the placebo group.  There were no deaths or withdrawals due to an AE during 
the study.  
During Part 2 of the study, three subjects experien ced a fall; each subject was in the EXPAREL 
266 mg group.  Each of the three subjects was able to complete the 20 -meter walk test at 
24 hours, 72 hours, and on Day 30.  The rate of inpatient falls in study  402- C-323, 1.8%, was  
very similar to the overall incidence of inpatient falls in TKA patients (between 1% and  2%).  
The 20- meter walk test was used to determine whether there was any significant degree of motor 
blockade with use of EXPAREL.  The percentage of subjects who were able to complete the walk test at 24  hours and 72 hours did not differ significantly across the EXPAREL and placebo 
groups in Part 1.  In Part 2, the percentage of subjects who were able to complete the walk te st 
was comparable between EXPAREL 266  mg and placebo groups at 24 hours (53.0% vs. 58.5%, 
respectively) and 72 hours (83.1%  vs. 92.6%, respectively).  This suggested a lack of significant 
motor blockade with EXPAREL.  This is confirmed by physician satisfa ction with return of 
sensory/motor function.  
Pooled Nerve Block Safety Data 
In the All Studies pool, 335 subjects received EXPAREL (All Doses), 33 subjects received 
bupivacaine HCl, and 207 subjects received placebo. 
Overall,  184/335 subjects (54.9%) in the EXPAREL All Doses group, 15/35 subjects (45.5%) in 
the bupivacaine HCl group, and 99/207 subjects (47.8%) in the placebo group experienced at 
least one TEAE in a preferred term ( PT) that had an incidence of ≥2%.  The incide nce and types 
of TEAEs (PTs) were similar between the EXPAREL All Doses group and the placebo group.  
In the EXPAREL All Doses group, the TEAEs reported with an incidence ≥2% were anemia (5.1%), bradycardia (2.1%), sinus tachycardia (2.1%), constipation (13.4%), feeling cold (3.3%), local swelling (2.1%), pyrexia (20.3%), procedural hypotension (5.1%), body temperature 
increased (2.4%), headache (4.5%), hypoesthesia (7.8%), paresthesia (2.1%), urinary retention

There were 17 TEAEs (anemia, bradycardia, sinus tachycardia, constipation, diarrhea, feeling 
cold, injection site erythema, pyrexia, postoperative wound infection, procedural hypotension, back pain, cluster headache, hypoesthesia, paresthesia, urinary retention, and pruritus) that 
occurred at an incidence of ≥5% in the EXPAREL 266 mg group where the incidence was  
greater in the EXPAREL group than in the placebo group.

9. STUDY DESIGN AND PLAN  
9.1. Study Design  
This is a Phase 4, multicenter, randomized, double -blind, controlled trial in approximately 
300 adult subjects undergoing primary unilateral TKA under spinal anesthesia with bupivacaine 
HCl (10-15 mg) . 
Bupivacaine is preferred as the spinal anesthetic; however, if the spinal fails or cannot be 
completed, the patient may receive general anesthesia.  Total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) is 
then the preferred route.  If TIVA is contraindicated or not prefera ble, then inhalational 
anesthetics may be used.  The use of fentanyl or short -acting analogues will be permitted in both 
groups.     
The following medications will be allowed: 
• Anti-emetics may be used pre- operatively or intra -operatively.  
o Decadron 10 mg x 1 intra -op is permitted  
o Scopolamine patch will be permitted if used as a pre -medication or intra -
operatively but should be removed post -operatively.  
• Lidocaine will be permitted, if used as a local anesthetic at the site of IV placement or as IV to stabiliz e heart rhythm.  
• Propofol is permitted for induction and intra -operatively, but not post -operatively.  
• Versed, 1 -2 mg IV, may be used pre -operatively for anxiety or sedation  
 
Subjects will be screened within 30 days prior to study drug administration.  Duri ng the 
screening visit, which must take place at least 1 day prior to surgery, subjects will be assessed for 
past or present neurologic, cardiac, and general medical conditions that in the opinion of  the 
Investigator would preclude them from study participation.  After the ICF is signed, a  medical 
history, surgical history, physical examination, physical therapy assessment, 12- lead 
electrocardiogram (ECG), vital sign measurements, urine drug screen, and urine pregnancy test 
for women of childbearing potenti al will be conducted.  
On Day 0, all eligible subjects will receive the following medications within 4 hours prior to 
surgery:  
• Acetaminophen /paracetamol 975- 1000 mg, PO . 
• Celecoxib 200 mg, PO . 
o If a subject has an allergy to celecoxib, they may use the following alternative 
drugs: naproxen 500 mg PO or meloxicam 7.5 mg PO. 
• Pregabalin up to 300 mg, PO . 
On Day 0, all eligible subjects will also receive tranexamic acid , up to 2 grams (IV), at the 
beginning of surgery or intra -operatively.

Subjects will be randomized 1:1 to two treatment groups.  Subjects in Group 1 will receive LIA 
with EXPAREL 266 mg in 20 mL admixed with bupivacaine HCl 0.5% in 20 mL and expanded 
in volume with 80 mL normal saline  (total volume of 120 mL) .  Subjects in Group 2 will receive 
LIA with bupivacaine HCl 0.5% in 20 mL expanded in volume with 100 mL normal saline  (total 
volume of 120 mL) .   
Trained and qualified Investigators (see Appendix 5) will use their usual surgical technique to 
perform the TKA.  Use of tourniquets and drains, if used, will be recorded.  The case is to be 
completed at a time that will allow for a postsurgical physical therapy assessment on Day 0.  
Subjects will be requir ed to remain at the hospital facility for a minimum of 48 hours  after 
surgery .  The subjects must still complete the 72 -hour assessments if they are discharged from 
the hospital facility prior to 72 hours after surgery.  
The use of fentanyl or analogues wil l be permitted (during surgery only) in both groups.  
Intraoperative administration of other opioids or any other analgesic, local anesthetics, or anti -
inflammatory agents will be prohibited in both groups, unless needed to treat an AE.  
Study drug will be  administered using six 20 cc syringes with 22- gauge needles prior to wound 
closure.  Each stick should deliver approximately 1- 1.5 cc to the intended area.  The tissue 
should visibly expand with minimal leakage.  Study drug should be injected in the presc ribed 
locations based on the areas of highest nerve density.

Prior to cementation  
• Syringe #1: Posterior capsule (8- 10 sticks medial and 8- 10 sticks lateral).  
• Syringe #2: Femur −  medial and lateral periosteum, posterior periosteum, suprapatellar/ 
quadricep s tendon (20 sticks).  
• Syringe #3: Tibia −  fat pad (5 sticks); pes anserinus, medial collateral ligament, and

• Syringe #6: Lateral gutter, femoral to tibial (10 sticks); s ubcutaneous/closure (10 sticks).  
In addition to LIA, all study participants will re ceive a standardized approach for managing 
postsur gical pain that includes a scheduled multimodal pain regimen including adjunctive 
analgesics, NSAIDs, and rescue analgesics as needed.  
Postsurgically, all subjects will receive the following scheduled medications until hospital 
discharge:  
• Acetaminophen /paracetamol 975- 1000 mg PO every 8 hours (q8h).  The  total daily dose 
is not to exceed 3000 mg.  
• Celecoxib 200 mg PO every 12 hours (q12h) . 
o If a subject has an allergy to celecoxib, they may use the following alternative drugs: naproxen 500 mg PO or meloxicam 7.5 mg PO.  
A prewritten order sheet with the scheduled medications will be given to the nurses for the 
subjects in this study.  
Postsurgi cal Rescue Medication  
Subjects should only receive rescue medication upon request for pain control, as needed.  Postsurgical rescue medication will consist of PO  immediate -release oxycodone initiating up to 
10 mg .  The subject may re -dose, per physician judgment, as needed (PRN), if initial medication 
fails. If a subject cannot tolerate PO medication, or has repeated failure of the rescue medication 
with oxycodone (PO), IV morphine (2.5- 5 mg) or hydromorphone ( 0.5-1 mg) may be 
administered q4h or PRN .  Patient -controlled analgesia (PCA) is not permitted .
  No other 
rescue analgesic agents, including NSAIDs, are permitted until hospital discharge.  After 
discharge, the analgesic regimen may be adjusted for each subject individually as deemed 
appropriate by the physician responsible for the postsurgical care.  
Postsurgical Assessments 
Postsurgical clinical assessments will include pain intensity scores using a 10 -cm visual analog 
scale (VAS) (see Appendix 1); o verall benefit of analgesia score (OBAS) questionnaire 
(see Appendix 2); total postsurgical opioid consumption; physical therapy assessment

(see Physical Therapy Assessment Manual ); nurse 's satisfaction with overall analgesia  
(see Appendix 3); and discharge readiness (see Appendix 4) .   
If a cardiac AE, neurological AE, fall , or SAE occurs during the study, an unscheduled PK blood 
sample should be collected  as close as possible to when the event occurs .  In addition, a 12- lead 
ECG, vital signs, and any appropriate clinical laboratory tests should be conducted as close as 
possible to when the event occurs .  For out -of-hospital events, the medical monitor should be 
contacted  to determine need for a PK sample and ECG .  Cardiac AEs of special interest include 
chest pain (angina, myocardial infarction), abnormal/irregular heart  rate (bradycardia, 
tachycardia, extrasystoles), and shortness of breath requiring intervention.  Neurologic AEs of 
special interest include altered mental status/altered sensorium, rigidity, dysarthria, seizure, tremors, metallic taste, tinnitus, perioral numbness, and visual disturbance.  Additionally, the 
following events are of special interest if they persist or occur beyond 72 -hours postdose: 
dizziness, hyperesthesia, muscular twitching, and tingling/paresthesia.  
Postsurgical health economic outcome a ssessments will include hospital length of stay (LOS), 
use of skilled nursing facility, outpatient physical therapy use, hospital readmissions, and use of 
other health services following discharge (phone calls related to postsurgical pain, unscheduled visits related to postsurgical pain, and visits to emergency department) through postsurgical 
Day 29.   
A follow -up visit will be scheduled for all subjects on postsurgical Day 14.  A follow -up phone 
call will be made on postsurgical Day  29 to all subjects who received study drug to assess for 
AEs.  
9.1.1. Duration of the Study and Subject Participation  
Participation will begin at the signing of the ICF.  No more than 30 days should pass between signing of the ICF and the administration of EXPAREL.  The time from stud y drug 
administration through the end of participation is 30 ± 3 days.  Therefore, subjects may participate in the study for up to 63 days.  
9.1.2. Study Stopping Rules  
If Pacira, the Investigator, or officials from regulatory authorities discover conditions during the 
study that indicate that the study or study site should be terminated, this action may be taken 
after Pacira has consulted with appropriate regulatory authorities and notified the Investigator(s).  
Blinded Data Review (BDR) of the subject  data wi ll be conducted by the Pacira Medical 
Monitoring Team after the first 60 subjects  have completed Day 29 and subsequently each block 
of 10 subjects complete through Day 29 throughout the conduct of this study.  The Pacira Study Data Management and Biostatistics team will work in conjunction to provide blinded tables, 
figures , and listings for the BDR.  Meeting notes will be compiled and filed at the end of each 
BDR session.  
The outcome of the BDR process will be the trigger for p rompting the Safety Stopping Rules 
based on the incidence rate of all AESIs  including the following:  
• Cardiac AESI s as defined in the protocol including cardiac arrest, hypertension, and 
hypotension exceeding 10% .

• Neurologic AESI s as defined in the study pr otocol including d ysgeusia and oral 
hypoaesthesia  exceeding 10% . 
• Incidence rate of severe AESI s including c ardiac AESI s and neurologic AESI sexceeding 
5%. 
• Falls exceeding 5% . 
• Dizziness exceeding 25% . 
Unblinded review of the data and a relative risk data analysis will occur if any one of the events 
above should occur.  If the risk relative to placebo  is greater than 2  at the 5% level  or all of the 
AESI appear in the EXPAREL arm and meet the criteria abo ve, the next step will be any one of 
the following actions:  
• Halt subject  dosing and/or study enrollment until the toxicity data can be further 
reviewed . 
• Revise eligibility criteria to exclude subjects who appear to be more at higher risk for a particula r AE.  
Any unexplained death will be thoroughly reviewed and appropriate action taken.  
 
9.2. Discussion of Study Design  
EXPAREL is  approved for infiltration into a surgical site .  This Phase 4, m ulticenter, 
randomized, double -blind, controlled trial in approximately 300 adult subjects undergoing 
primary unilateral TKA is designed t o further evaluate the efficacy and  safety of LIA with 
EXPAREL for postsurgical analgesia in subjects undergoing TKA.  The double -blind study 
design is intended to avoid potential bias resulting from subject or Investigator knowledge of the assigned treatment.  
All subjects will receive an opioid analgesic , as needed , to control breakthrough postsurgical 
pain. 
If a cardiac AE, neurological AE, fall, or SAE  occurs during the study, an unscheduled PK blood 
sample should be collected  as close as possible to when the event occurs .  In addition, a 12- lead 
ECG, vital signs, and any appropriate clinical laboratory tests should be conducted as close as 
possible to when the event occurs .  For out -of-hospital events, the medical monitor should be 
contacted  to determine need for a PK sample and ECG .  Cardiac AEs of sp ecial interest include 
chest pain (angina, myocardial infarction), abnormal/irregular heart rate (bradycardia, tachycardia, extrasystoles), and shortness of breath requiring intervention.  Neurologic AEs of special interest include altered mental status/al tered sensorium, rigidity, dysarthria, seizure, 
tremors, metallic taste, tinnitus, perioral numbness, and visual disturbance.  Additionally, the following events are of special interest if they persist or occur beyond 72 -hours postdose: 
dizziness, hyperest hesia, muscular twitching, and tingling/paresthesia.

If a subject who withdraws from the study has an ongoing AE, every effort  must be made to 
follow such events until satisfactory resolution is obtained, or further follow -up is otherwise no 
longer warranted.  
10.3.1. Withdrawal Secondary to Adverse Events  
If a subject experiences an AE that renders him or her incapable of continuing with the 
remaining  study assessments, then he or she will be discontinued from further participation in the 
study.  A  final evaluation should be performed so that the subject’s study participation can be 
terminated in a safe and orderly manner.  
10.3.2. Voluntary or St udy Investigator Withdrawal  
Subjects are free to discontinue from the study at any time, without prejudice to future treatment.  
Nevertheless, subjects will be encouraged to complete at least the study safety assessments.  
In addition, a subject may be dis continued from the study if he or she refuses to comply with 
study procedures.  Reasons for discontinuation from the  study will be recorded. 
If a subject is discontinued by the Investigator or voluntarily withdraws from the study after receiving study drug , the subject will be asked to complete a final evaluation so that he or she  
can be withdrawn in a safe and orderly manner.  In the final evaluation, vital signs and any 
changes in the subject's health status will be recorded.   
After termination from the study, the subject may be followed for safety including monitoring of 
AEs through postsurgical  Day 29.

11. TREATMENTS  
11.1. Treatment to be Administered  
Prior to Surgery  
On Day 0, all eligible subjects will receive the following medications within 4 hours prior to 
surgery:  
• Acetaminophen /paracetamol 975- 1000 mg, PO . 
• Celecoxib 200 mg, PO . 
o If a subject has an allergy to celecoxib, they may use the following alternative 
drugs: naproxen 500 mg PO or meloxicam 7.5 mg PO. 
• Pregabalin up to 300 mg, PO . 
On Day 0, al l eligible subjects will also receive tranexamic acid , up to 2 grams (IV)  at the 
beginning of surgery or intra -operatively.  
During Surgery  
Subjects in Group 1 will receive LIA with EXPAREL 266 mg in 20 mL admixed with  
bupivacaine HCl 0.5% in 20 mL and expanded in volume with 80 mL normal saline  (total 
volume of 120 mL) .  Subjects in Group 2 will receive LIA with bupivacaine HCl 0.5% in 20 mL 
expanded in volume with 100 mL normal saline  (total volume of 120 mL) .   
After  Surgery 
Postsurgically, all subjects will receive the following scheduled medications until hospital 
discharge:  
• Acetaminophen /paracetamol 975- 1000 mg PO q8h.  The  total daily dose is not to exceed 
3000 mg.  
• Celecoxib 200 mg PO q12h. 
o If a subject has an allergy to celecoxib, they may use the following alternative 
drugs: naproxen 500 mg PO or meloxicam 7.5 mg PO. 
Rescue Medication  
Subjects should only receive rescue medication upon request for pain control, as needed.  Postsurgical rescue medication will consist of PO  immediate -release oxycodone initiating up to 
10 mg .  The subject may re -dose, per physician judgment , PRN, if initial rescue medication fails.  
If a subject cannot tolerate PO medication  or has repeated failure of the rescue medication with 
oxycodone (PO) , IV morphine (2.5- 5 mg) or hydromorphone ( 0.5-1 mg) may be administered 
q4h or PRN .  PCA  is not permitted .  No other rescue analgesic agents, including NSAIDs, are 
permitted until hospital discharge.  After discharge, the analgesic regimen may be adjusted for each subject individually as deemed appropriate by the physician responsible for the  postsurgical 
care.

EXPAREL®             Clinical Study Protocol Amendment 2 
 
11.1.1. Administration Technique  
Study drug will be administered using six 20 cc syringes with 22- gauge needles prior to wound 
closure.  Each stick should deliver approximately 1- 1.5 cc to the intended area.  The tissue 
should visibly expand w ith minimal leakage.  Study drug should be injected in the prescribed 
locations based on the areas of highest nerve density.  
Prior to cementation  
• Syringe #1: Posterior capsule (8- 10 sticks medial and 8- 10 sticks lateral).  
• Syringe #2: Femur −  medial and la teral periosteum, posterior periosteum, 
suprapatellar/quadricep s tendon (20 sticks).  
• Syringe #3: Tibia −  fat pad (5 sticks); Pes anserinus, medial collateral ligament, and 
gutter (15 sticks)  
• Syringe #4: Circumferential periosteum (15 -20 sticks).  
After cementation  
• Syringe #5: Midline quadriceps  tendon (10 sticks); retinaculum, medial gutter, femoral to 
tibia (10 sticks).   
• Syringe #6: Lateral gutter, femoral to tibial (10 sticks); s ubcutaneous/closure ( 10 sticks).  
11.1.2. Study Drug Administration Considerations  
Since there is a potential risk of severe adverse effects associated with the administration of 
bupivacaine, the study site s must be equipped to manage subjects with any evidence of cardiac 
toxicity.   
EXPAREL  may not be administered to a subject if it has  been held in a syringe for more than 
4 hours after preparation.  In  order to prevent the study drug from settling, gently inverting and 
re-inverting the syringe several times prior to administration is recommended.    
11.2. Identity of Investigational Product(s)  
11.2.1. Description of EXPAREL  
EXPAREL  is formulated as a sterile, non -pyrogenic, white to off -white, preservative -free, 
homogeneous suspension of bupivacaine encapsulated into multivesicular lipid- based particles 
(the DepoFoam drug delivery system).  Bupivacaine is present at a nominal  concentration of 
13.3 mg/mL.  EXPAREL  will be provided in 20 mL, 1.3%  (13.3 mg/mL) single -use, clear glass 
vials.   EXPAREL vials should be stored refrigerated between 2°C to 8°C (36°F to 46°F).  
11.2.2. Description of Reference Product  
Bupivacaine HCl is a long -acting local anesthetic, used for surgical anesthesia and acute p ain 
management.  It is an alternative to NSAIDs and opioids.  A multimodal approach of pain 
management with the use of a long- acting local anesthetic can reduce the total consumption of 
NSAIDs and opioids during the critical first 12 hours post -surgery .

EXPAREL®             Clinical Study Protocol Amendment 2 
 
11.2.3. Description of Diluents  
Normal saline  for injection ( 80 mL) will be added to  the admixed study drug for Group 1 to 
achieve a total volume of 120 mL .  Normal saline  for injection ( 100 mL) will be added to the 
study drug in Group 2 ( bupivacaine HCl 0.5% in 20 mL ) to achieve a total volume of 120 mL .   
11.3. Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatment  
11.3.1. Randomization Scheme  
Approximately 300 subjects ( 150 per treatment group) are planned for enrollment.  Subjects will 
be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive  either LIA with EXPAREL 266 mg admixed with  
bupivacaine HCl 0.5% (Group 1) or  LIA with bupivacaine HCl 0.5% (Group 2). 
The randomization code will be generated by a centralized randomization system, which will 
also be used to communicate subject randomizations to study sites.  All  rando mized subjects will 
have both a unique subject identifier and a unique random code identifier.  No subject or random 
code identifiers are to be reused once assigned.   
11.3.2. Randomization Procedures  
Once a subject is identified as being qualified for the study pe r the eligibility  criteria ( see 
Section  10.1 and Section  10.2), and is at the study site for surgery, the unblinded research 
pharmacist or designee will obtain a randomization assignment.  The subject will be considered randomized into the study once the study treatment assignment is received.  
11.3.3. Replacement of Subject s 
Subjects who are randomized but are withdrawn from the study before receiving study drug or 
do not undergo the surgical procedure may  be replaced.  Once assigned, subject numbers will not 
be reused; subjects enrolled to replace those who withdraw will be  assigned a unique subject 
number and randomized to treatment according to the procedures outlined above.  
11.4. Selection of Doses in the Study  
During the clinical development of EXPAREL, single doses  ranging from 2 mg to 665 mg have 
been safely administered via various routes.  Pharmacokinetic studies have shown that because EXPAREL releases bupivacaine gradually as the lipid structure breaks down, administration of 
EXPAREL 266 mg results in a maximum plasma concentration ( C
max) equivalent to that seen 
with stan dard bupivacaine HCl 100 mg.  EXPAREL 266 mg, the FDA -approved and marketed 
dose, was selected for this study.  Based  on current clinical practice, b upivacaine HCl 0.5% was 
selected  for this study , consistent with standard of care  (Brener 2013) .   
11.5. Blinding  
11.5.1. Blinding Procedures  
To maintain the double -blind  study design , only the unblinded study personnel who are NOT 
involved with protocol -specific, post surgical  assessments may prepare  and administer  the study 
drug.  Staff members conducting study -specific, po stsurgical  assessments and the subject s will

EXPAREL®             Clinical Study Protocol Amendment 2 
 
remain blinded to the assigned treatment  throughout the study .  If a subject experiences an SAE, 
Pacira will not automatically unblind the  subject’s treatment, unless it is necessary to manage 
treatment of  the S AE.  Expedited  SAEs will be unblinded by Pacira for regulatory reporting 
purposes.  
At each site, only the designated unblinded pharmacist will receive the unblinded randomization 
assignments and  be responsible for preparing study drug.  
Assignment of blinded and unblinded responsibilities regarding the preparation of study drug 
should take into account that EXPAREL  must be administered within 4 hours of opening 
the vial. 
The individuals preparing and administering study drug will not be allowed to perform any of 
the study assessments or reveal the assigned study treatment to any other members of the study 
team at any time.  Syringes containing study drug will need to be gently inverted several times 
to re-suspend any settling of the study  drug that may have occurred prior to administration.  
The administration  of study drug will be recorded using the minimal amount of information 
necessary to avoid unblinding staff who will be participating in blinded procedures  (see 
Pharmacy Manual for ad ditional details) . 
No crossover will be permitted between the blinded and unblinded study site personnel during 
the study period.  The assignment of site monitors will also be segregated.  Blinded monitors will 
review case report forms ( CRFs ), clinic chart s, and all other study -related documents that do not 
disclose the allocation of study treatment.  Care should be taken in recording and review of 
operating r oom records to not record information in an unblinded fashion.  Pharmacy or any 
other clinic record s providing unblinded information (e.g., randomization, study drug 
preparation, study drug accountability, study drug administration) will be reviewed by 
specialized unblinded monitors who will notify Pacira of treatment noncompliance.  
11.5.2. Unblinding Procedure s 
Subject treatment assignments should not be unblinded during the study by blinded study 
personnel.  The Investigator will have the ability to unblind a subject through the randomization 
system if he or she feels that subject safety warrants such unblindi ng.  However, the Investigator 
should discuss the safety issues with the Medical Monitor before attempting such unblinding, 
if possible.  Any unblinding will be documented through immediate notification of the Pacira 
study team and the Investigator  within the interactive response technology ( IRT) system used for 
randomization.  The reason for unblinding will be documented.  Any accidental unblinding events (i.e., through mishaps in the operating room or miscommunication among study staff) 
must be reported t o Pacira immediately.  
Any unblinding performed through the randomization system  will be recorded as a transaction 
and the appropriate study personnel will be notified that such a transaction occurred.  
Any incidence(s) of unblinding will be noted in the c linical s tudy report with a full discussion of 
the events leading to the decision to unblind. 
11.6. Prior and Concomitant Therapy and Medications  
All medications taken within 3 0 days prior to study drug administration through hospital 
discharge or until the subject is withdrawn from the study, whichever is sooner, will be recorded

on the CRF.  All postsurgical analgesics administered must be documented through postsurgical 
Day 29 .  Additionally, any medications administered in association with a n AE will be recorded 
through postoperative Day 29.   
11.6.1. Before Study Drug Administration  
Permitted Prior Medications  
• Low-dose aspirin for cardioprotection. 
• Presurgical medications are described in Section  11.1.   
Restricted Prior Medications and Therapy  
• Systemic glucocorticosteroids are prohibited within 1 month of enrollment in this study.  
• Initiation of treatment with any of the following medications is prohibited within 1 month 
of study drug administration  or if the medication(s) are being given to control pain: 
SSRIs,  SNRIs, gabapentin, pregabalin (Lyrica), or duloxetine (Cymbalta).  If  a subject is 
taking one of these medications for a reason other than pain control, he or she must be on 
a stable dose for at least 1  month prior to study drug  administration.  
• Long-acting opioid medication s or NSAIDs  (except for low -dose aspirin used for 
cardioprotection)  are not permitted within 3 days of study drug ad ministration.  
• Dexmedetomidine HCl ( Precedex ) use i s not permitted within 3 days of study drug 
administration . 
• No opioid medications  are permitted within 24 hours  of study drug administration .   
• Use of  an investigational product within 30 days or 5 elimination half -lives of such 
investigational drug, whichever is longer, prior to study drug administration, or planned 
administration of another investigational product or procedure during the subject’s 
participation in this study  is not permitted.  
11.6.2. During Surgery  
Permitted  
• The use of  fentanyl  or analogs  will be permitted  during surgery.  
Restricted  
• No drugs (e.g., epinephrine, dexamethasone, clonidine) other than bupivacaine are to be 
admixed with study drug . 
• Lidocaine and other local anesthetics will  not be permitted to be locally administered 
during surgery because they are known to interact with EXPAREL  resulting in the 
displacement of bupivacaine and elevated plasma levels.  
• Intrathecal opioids. 
• The use of long -acting opioids (e.g., morphine, hydrom orphone HCl), acetaminophen/ 
paracetamol , ketorolac, or other NSAIDs will not be permitted intraoperatively except for 
emergency use to treat an AE.

11.6.3. During Hospitalization  
Permitted  
• The p ermitted r escue medication s are described in Section  11.1.     
• Scheduled postsurgical medications are described in Section  11.1.   
Restricted  
• No other rescue analgesics , including postsurgical use of fentanyl,  are permitted during 
hospitalization . 
• PCA is not permitted.  
• Anesthetics in the "caine" family are prohibited.  
• Dexmedetomidine HCl (Precedex) use is prohibited . 
For study purposes, it is important to standardize pain management modalities following study 
drug administration.  Therefore, the study staff must adhere closely to the treatment options and requirements noted in the protocol .  After hospital discharge , the analgesic regimen may be 
adjusted for each subject individually as deemed appropriate by the physician responsible for the postsurgical care.  
All postsurgical analgesics administered must be documented through postsurgical Day 29 .  
11.7. Treatment Compliance  
Not applicable, since study drug will be administered intra operatively  by the study staff . 
11.8. Accountability of Study Drug  
Any shipment of EXPAREL  for the study will contain an investigational drug transmittal and 
receipt form to assist the Investigator or designee (e.g., pharmacist) in maintaining current and 
accurate inventory records.  At a minimum, the Investigator or designee will maintain accur ate 
records demonstrating dates and units of drug received, lot numbers, subjects to whom drug was administered, and accounts of any drug destroyed accidentally or deliberately.  The Investigator must retain vials containing used, unused, or expired EXPARE L for return or destruction, as 
instructed by Pacira, following confirmation of drug accountability data by a study monitor.  A record of drug return or destruction will be maintained and provided to Pacira.  Inventory 
records must be readily available for  inspection by the study monitor and appropriate regulatory 
authorities at any time.  A copy of the inventory records, drug accountability information, and notice of return or destruction will be returned to Pacira at the end of the study.  Only authorized personnel identified by the Investigator will have the ability to access and administer the drug .

12. STUDY ENDPOINTS AND MEASUREMENTS  
12.1. Efficacy Assessments  
The following efficacy measurements will be assessed at the times specified after the end of 
surgery:  
• Pain intensity scores using the VAS  upon arrival at  the post -anesthesia care unit (PACU); 
at 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 24, 28, 32, 36, 48, 52, 56, 60, and 72 hours or until hospital discharge; just prior to hospital discharge; and immediately  prior to each administr ation of  rescue 
pain medication  (see Appendix  1). 
• Amount of all opioid rescue analgesics taken through postsurgical Day 29.  
• The OBAS questionnaire at 24, 48, and 72 hours or upon hospital discharge (see Appendix 2) .   
• Physical therapy assessments (timed up  and go test , stair climbing  test, and timed walk 
test) will be conducted once postsurgically on Day 0; at approximately 8:00 am and 
8:00 pm ( ±2 hours)  from postsurgical Day 1 through hospital discharge; and on 
postsurgical D ay 14  (see Physical Therapy Assessment Manual ).  Preemptive use of 
opioids or NSAIDs prior to the physical therapy assessment  is not permitted . 
• Nurse’s satisfaction with overall analgesia will be assessed at 24, 48, and 72 hours or 
upon hospital discharge (see  Appendix 3) . 
• Discharge readiness will be assessed q12 h (at approximately 8:00 am and 8:00 pm  
[±2 hours] ) from postsurgical Day 0 up to hospital discharge or up to reaching the 
discharge readiness score of 9, whichever comes first.  Once a score of 9 is reached no 
further discharge readiness assessments are required (see Appendix 4) .

13. STUDY PROCEDURES  
A time and events schedule for all study procedures is provided in Table 1 . 
13.1. Instructions for Conducting Procedures and Measures  
All assessments conducted after baseline (i.e., study drug administration) will be timed from the 
end of surgery .   
At timepoints when multiple assessments coincide, the VAS pain intensity assessment  will be 
conducted first  and the physical therapy assessment will be conducted last .   
Day 0 is defined as the day on which study dr ug is administered.  The beginning of surgery is 
defined as the time of the first incision.  The end of surgery is defined as the time of the last 
suture.  Postsurgical is defined as after the end of surgery.   
Postsurgical analgesia and collection of stud y data through the primary endpoint will take place 
under the supervision of study staff.  
13.1.1. Pain Intensity Assessment  
Pain intensity will be assessed using a 10- cm VAS  (Carlsson 1983, McCormack 1988, and 
Scott  1976) at baseline ( Day 0 prior to surgery ); upon arrival at the PACU; at 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 24, 
28, 32, 36, 48, 52, 56, 60, and 72 hours; immediately prior to each administration of  rescue pain 
medication ; and just prior to hospital discharge  (see Appendix 1).  
If ice or passive extenders are used, these must be stopped at least 15 minutes prior to the pain 
intensity assessment.  If subjects are in immobilizers, these must be removed at least 15  minutes 
prior to the pain intensity assessment.  This does not apply to rescue medication VAS. 
13.1.2. Overall Ben efit of Analgesia Score Questionnaire  
The OBAS questionnaire will be completed at  24, 48, and 72 hours , or upon hospital discharge  
(see Appendix 2).  
13.1.3. Nurse's  Satisfaction with Postsurgical Pain Control  
The nurse 's satisfaction with postsurgical pain control will be assessed using the Likert Scale 
at 24, 48, and 72 hours , or upon hospital discharge  (see Appendix 3).  
13.1.4. Vital Signs  
The scheduled vital signs (heart rate and blood pressure) will be measured after the subj ect has 
rested in a supine  position for at least 5 minutes at screening  and baseline ( Day 0 prior to 
surgery) .  Vital signs will also be measured if a subject experiences an AE of special interest 
(i.e., cardiac AE, neurological AE, or fall) or an SAE  (see Section 13.1.7) .  The subject will 
remain in a supine  position during the assessment.

13.1.5. Physical Examination  
A full physical examination will be conducted at screening .   Superficial abnormalities that may 
interfere with participation in the study will be noted .  A targeted physical examination of the 
lower extremity and the knee itself will be conducted on Day 14.  
13.1.6. Electrocardiogram  
A 12-lead ECG  will be conducted at screening  after the subject has rested in a supine  position for 
at least 5 minutes .  A 12 -lead ECG will also be conducted if a subject experiences an AE of 
special interest (i.e., cardiac AE, neurological AE, or fall) or an SAE (see Section 13.1.7).   
13.1.7. Adverse Events of Special Interest  
If a cardiac AE, neurological AE, fall, or SAE  occurs during the study, an unscheduled PK blood 
sample should be collected  as close as possible to when the event occurs .  In addition, a 12- lead 
ECG, vital signs, and any appropriate clinical laboratory tests should be conducted as close as 
possible to when the event occurs .  For out -of-hospital events, the medical monitor should be 
contacted .   
Cardiac AEs of special interest include :  
• Chest pain (angina, myocardial infarction)  
• Abnormal/irregular heart rate (bradycardia, tachycardia, extrasystoles)  
• Shortness of breath requiring intervention.   
Neurologic AEs of special interest include:   
• Altered m ental status/altered sensorium  
• Rigidity 
• Dysarthria  
• Seizure 
• Tremors

14. ADVERSE EVENT REPORT ING  
Consistent with the current regulatory guidance provided by the US FDA CFR Part 312 and the 
ICH GCP, AEs  and SAEs are defined in Section  14.1.1 and Section 14.2.1, respectively.   
The concepts of AEs and SAEs represent regulatory instruments used to evaluate and monitor the safety of clinical study subjects.  Therefore, these terms only apply in light of their regulatory definition.  The term serious, in a regulatory sense, does not necessarily mean severe.  The SAE 
concept is used primarily to identify, during the conduct of the study, those SAEs that may 
require expedited reporting to regulatory authorities. 
14.1. Adverse Events  
14.1.1. Definitions  
Definition of Advers e Event (AE) : Any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of 
a drug in humans, whether or not considered drug related.  An AE (also referred to as an adverse 
experience) can be any unfavorable and unintended sign (e.g., abnormal laboratory finding), 
symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug, without any judgment about causality.  An AE can arise from any use of the drug (e.g., off -label use in combination with 
another drug) and from any route of administration, formulation, or dose, including an overdose.  
An AE can be any unfavorable and unintended change in a body structure or body function.  Adverse events include any clinically significant deterioration of a subject’s medical status.  
The AE may involve any organ or syst em and can be represented by the new onset or 
deterioration of a disease, a syndrome, a symptom, a physical sign, as well as by findings and 
results of instrumental examinations and laboratory tests.  Any medically relevant and untoward 
change after the su bject signs the ICF, including frequency or pattern changes for a fluctuating 
condition (e.g., migraine) is considered an AE.   
An AE that occurs after the ICF is signed and before the start of the study drug administration is identified as a pretreatment AE (PTAE).  An AE that occurs after the administration of the study 
treatment is considered a TEAE.   
Definition of Adverse Reaction:  Any AE caused by a drug.  Adverse reactions are a subset of all 
suspected adverse reactions for which there is reason to c onclude that the drug caused the event.  
Definition of Suspected Adverse Reaction: Any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility 
that the drug caused the AE.  A  suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser degree of certainty 
about causality than advers e reaction, which means any AE caused by a drug.  Suspected adverse 
reactions are a subset of all AEs for which there is a reasonable possibility that the drug caused 
the event.  
14.1.2. Recording Adverse Events  
It is the responsibility of the Investigator to docum ent all AEs (i.e., PTAEs and TEAEs) with an 
onset after the subject signs the ICF.  For the purpose of this study, all AEs that occur through 
postsurgical Day 29 must be recorded regardless of whether or not they are considered related to 
study drug.  Whenever feasible, AE terms should be documented as medical diagnoses (highest

possible level of integration); otherwise, the AEs should be reported separately as individual 
signs or symptoms.  Only one AE per line should be recorded in the AE CRF; for example , an 
AE of nausea and vomiting should be listed as two separate events: the event of nausea and the event of vomiting.  If a diagnosis is established after symptoms are recorded on the AE CRF, the diagnosis should be recorded and the symptoms collapsed (re moved; i.e., lined through and 
initialed).  Whenever possible, abnormal laboratory results should be reported as their clinical corollary (e.g., low potassium should be recorded as hypokalemia).  
A continuous AE with varying grades of severity should be rec orded as one AE.  The highest 
grade of severity experienced by that subject during the course of the continuous AE should be recorded.  
Any condition noted before the subject signs the ICF  will be listed as Medical History and is 
considered a pre -existing c ondition.  If a pre -existing condition changes (i.e., becomes more 
severe or more frequent) at any time after the ICF is signed , or after study drug administration, 
it is considered an AE.  Note: A change in treatment for a pre -existing condition (e.g., ne w high 
blood pressure medication), does not necessarily indicate an AE.  
Information recorded on the AE CRF will include the AE term, the date and time of onset, severity, seriousness, relationship to study drug, action taken with subject due to an AE , and the 
outcome of the AE, including the date and time of resolution, if  applicable.   
14.1.3. Severity of Adverse Events  
In general, the severity of an AE should be categorized using the following guidelines:  
Mild : An AE that is easily tolerated by the subject, caus ing minimal 
discomfort and not interfering with everyday activities.  
Moderate:  An AE that is discomforting and interferes with normal everyday 
activities.  
Severe:  An AE that prevents normal everyday activities . 
The term "severe" is often used to describe the intensity (severity) of a specific event (as in mild, 
moderate, or severe myocardial infarction); the event itself, however, may be of relatively minor medical significance (such as severe headache).  This is not the same as "serious," which is based on patient/event outcome or action criteria usually associated with events that pose a threat to a 
patient's life or functioning.  Seriousness (not severity) serves as a guide for defining regulatory 
reporting obli gations. 
14.1.4. Relationship of Adverse Events to Study Drug  
The Investigator will assess the relationship of the AE to study drug after careful medical 
consideration on a case -by-case basis.  General guidelines for determining the AE ’s causality to 
the study dru g are provided below.  
Unrelated:  A causal relationship between the study drug and the AE can be 
easily ruled out (e.g., based on the temporal sequence, absence of a 
reasonable pathophysiological mechanism, or direct evidence of actual cause).

EXPAREL®             Clinical Study Protocol Amendment 2 
 
Unlikely :  A clinical event with a temporal relationship to study drug 
administration which makes a causal relationship improbable and in 
which other drugs, chemicals, or underlying disease provide a plausible explanation;  
Possible:  A clinical event with a reasonable t ime sequence to administration 
of the study drug but which could also be explained by a concurrent disease or other drugs or chemicals;  
Probable:  A clinical event with a reasonable time sequence to administration 
of the study drug unlikely to be attributed to a concurrent disease or other drugs or chemicals and which follows a clinically reasonable response on withdrawal (dechallenge); or  
Definite:  The pharmacological properties of the study drug(s) or of the 
substance class, and the course of the AE  after dechallenge and, if 
applicable, after rechallenge, and/or specific test indicate involvement of the study drug(s) in the occurrence/worsening of the AE, and no indication of other causes exists.
 
14.1.5. Outcome of Adverse Events  
The Investigator will assess the o utcome of the AE after careful medical consideration, on a 
case- by-case basis.  General guidelines are provided below:  
Recovered/Resolved:  The event resolved and the subject recovered from the AE. 
Recovered/Resolved  
with Sequelae:  The initial event resolved, but has a continuing abnormal condition 
as a result of the AE.  
Not Recovered/  
Not Resolved:  At the time of last assessment, the event was ongoing, with an 
undetermined outcome.  Note: ongoing AEs are not to be considered 
resolved as a result of death. 
Recovering/Resolving:  At the time of last assessment, the event was decreasing in frequency, severity, etc., and a resolution was expected.  
Fatal:  The AE directly caused death.  
Unknown:  There was an inability to access the subject or the subject’ s records 
to determine the outcome (e.g., subject withdrew consent or was lost to follow -up). 
14.1.6. Action Taken with Subject due to an Adverse Event  
The Investigator will provide any actions taken regarding the subject (e.g., treatment, diagnostic tests, laboratory tests, or therapy) for each reported AE. 
• None.  
• Medication.

• Non-pharmaceutical therapy.  (The specific therapy used must be recorded in the 
CRF.)  
• Discontinued from study.  
• Other.  (The specific action taken must be recorded.)  
14.2. Serious Adverse Events  
14.2.1. Definition of a Serious Adverse Event  
Definition of a Serious Adverse Event (SAE): An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered 
“serious” if, in the view of either the Investigator or Sponsor, it results in any of the following 
outcomes:  
• Death1. 
• A life -threatening adverse event2.  
• Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization3. 
• A persistent or significant incapacity4. 
• Congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
• Medically significant5. 
1Death:  Any event resulting in a subject’s death  must be reported as an SAE.  However, death, 
in and of itself, is not an AE; it is an outcome.  The cause of death is the AE.  Therefore, the Investigator should make every effort to obtain and document the cause of death for all subjects who die during t he study.  If, despite all efforts, the cause of death remains unknown, the AE 
should be documented as an “unspecified fatal event.”  
2Life-threatening : An AE is considered life -threatening if, in the view of either the Investigator 
or Sponsor, its occurren ce places the subject at immediate risk of death.  It does not include an 
AE that had it occurred in a more severe form might have caused death.  
3Hospitalization : It should be noted that hospitalization, in and of itself, does not represent an 
SAE.  It is the AE leading to the subject’s hospitalization that becomes “serious” when it 
requires inpatient care.  Consequently, an SAE should not be reported in case of preplanned 
hospitalizations for a pre -existing condition that did not worsen during the study.  However, 
any medical condition that delays a subject’s discharge from the hospital (i.e., prolonged 
hospitalization) or requires the subject to be readmitted should be reported as an SAE.  
4Persistent or significant incapacity : A substantial disruption of a  person’s ability to conduct 
normal life functions.  
5Medically Significant : Important medical events that may not result in death, be  life-
threatening, or require hospitalization, may be considered serious when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, the y may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.  Examples of such medically significant events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalization, 
or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.

14.2.2. Reporting Serious Adverse Events  
Any SAE or death that occurs at any time after the subject signs the ICF through postsurgical 
Day 29, whether or not related to EXPAREL, must be reported by the Investigator or designee to 
Pacira Drug Safety within 24 hours of discovery by either email ( drugsafety@pacira.com ) or fax 
(973-201-0649) .  In addition, the Investigator or designee is encouraged to contact the Medical 
Monitor to discuss the case, as needed .   
Investigators should not wait to receive additional information to fully document the event 
before notifying Pacira Drug Safety or designee of the SAE.  The fax or email report should be followed by a full written summary using the SAE Form detailing relevant aspects of the SAE in 
question.  Where applicable, information from relevant hospital records and autopsy reports 
should be obtained and all patient -identifying information redacted prior to forwarding to Pacira.  
In the event of a fatal or life- threatening SAE, any required follow -up must be provided to Pacira  
Drug Safety or designee immediately.  The Investigator will follow all SAEs until resolved or the condition stabilizes and further follow -up is not warranted.  
If the Investigator is made aware of any SAEs after postsurgical Day 29, these should also be 
reported to Pacira Drug Safety or designee provided the SAE is considered related to EXPAREL.  
The site would then provide a completed SAE form within 1 business day and the event would be followed until resolution, or until adequate stabilization is met.

A sample size of 130 subjects in each group is needed to have at least 90% power to detect a 
−0.3 unit difference in the geometric means for total opioid dose assuming the  common standard 
deviation (SD) is 0.670 using a two group t -test with a 0.025 two- sided significance 
level.   A sample size of 78 is needed in each group to have at least 90% power to detect a 
difference in AUC (12-48) of the VAS pain intensity score means of − 40 assuming the common SD 
is 70 using a two group t -test with a 0.025 two- sided significance level.  Three hundred subjects 
(150 per treatment arm) will be randomized into this study in order to have  260 evaluable 
subjects.  
15.4. Analysis Populations  
The fol lowing analysis sets are planned:  
The safety analysis set will include all s ubjects who receive study drug.  All analyses based on 
the safety set will be by actual treatment received.  
The efficacy analysis set will include all subjects in the safety analys is set who undergo the 
planned surgery.  All analyses based on the efficacy analysis set will be by randomized treatment 
regardless of treatment actually received.  
15.5. Handling Subject Dropouts and Discontinuations  
For the calculation of the AUC of VAS pain intensity scores through any of the time periods, missing data will be imputed using a multiple imputation scheme.  Details for the multiple 
imputation scheme will be provided in the SAP.

15.6. Statistical Analyses  
15.6.1. Baseline Characteristics  
Demographic and baseline  characteristics will be summarized by treatment group.  
15.6.2. Study Compliance  
The percentage of subjects in each analysis set and the percentage who fail to complete the study 
(as well as the reasons for discontinuation) will be displayed by treatment group. 
15.6.3. Efficacy Analyses  
All efficacy analyses will be based on randomized treatment, regardless of actual treatment 
received.  
15.6.3.1  Primary Efficacy Measures  
The primary efficacy measures in this study are the AUC of the VAS pain intensity scores from hour 12 through 48 hours and total opioid consumption from hour 0 thru 48 hours.  For t he AUC 
of the VAS  pain intensity scores through 48 hours, EXPAREL  will be compared to placebo 
using analysis of variance (ANOVA) with treatment and site as main effect s.  Total opioid 
consumption will be log transformed then analyzed using ANOVA with treatment and site as main effects.  To protect the type 1 error rate, total opioid consumption will be tested only if the 
comparison between EXPAREL and placebo for AUC is significa nt.  All comparisons will be at 
the 5% alpha level.  For the AUC comparison, the difference between the treatment groups will 
be estimated along with the 2 -sided 95% confidence intervals (CI s).  For the total opioid 
consumption comparison, the ratio of EXPAREL to placebo along with the 2- sided 95% CI for 
the ratio will be estimated.  
Handling of Subjects Requiring Rescue Medication 
For AUC of the VAS  pain intensity scores, prior to analysis the w indowed Worst -Observation-
Carried -Forward (wWOCF) imputation method will be applied.  For subjects who take rescue 
pain medication, their pain intensity scores recorded within the window of controlled type of 
rescue medication will be replaced by the ‘wors t’ observation.  All pain scores within that 
window will be replaced by the ‘worst’ observation.  The worst observation will be the highest 
score in the time interval from the end of surgery to first rescue medication or, for subsequent 
rescue medication i ntervals, the end of the previous rescue window to the rescue medication.  
The VAS score at the time of rescue and end of previous rescue window are included in the 
determination of worst observation.  If the rescue medication intervals overlap, then worst  
observation may be the value carried from the prior interval.  Note that pain intensity scores in the window that are higher than the worst value prior to rescue pain medication will not be overwritten.  If no pain intensity score is available prior to the first rescue pain medication, the 
worst observation from all available measurements will be used instead. 
15.6.3.2  Secondary Efficacy Measures  
The secondary efficacy measures will be analyzed using a hierarchical fixed -sequence stepwise 
testing procedur e.  To protect the Type 1 error rate, the testing will be performed in a 
CLN -PRO -0151.002

sequentially rejective fashion.  If the first test is significant at the 0.05  level , then, and only then, 
the next secondary efficacy measure will be tested, and so forth.  The  result s will be declared 
statistically significant at the 0.05 significance level.   The secondary endpoints and order of the 
hierarchy will be defined in the SAP.  
The secondary VAS AUCs selected for analysis will be analyzed as described for the primary 
AUC.  
The secondary total opioid consumption endpoints selected for analysis will be analyzed as 
described for total opioid consumption through 48 hours. 
The secondary endpoints measuring proportions of subjects selected for analysis will be analyzed 
using a Cochran- Mantel -Haenszel (CMH) test stratified by site.  
The secondary t imes to event endpoints selected for analysis  will be analyzed using logistic 
regression and Kaplan -Meier method s. 
All other secondary endpoints will be summarized or tabulated as appropriate without testing for a treatment difference.  
15.6.4. Safety Analyses  
All safety analyses will be based on actual treatment received.  
15.6.4.1. Adverse Events  
Adverse event verbatim terms will be mapped to preferred terms and related system organ class using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA).  Events that start prior to the 
start of study drug administration will be identified in listings only.  Incidence rates of TEAEs 
and the proportion of subject prematurely withdrawn from the study due to a TEA E will be 
shown for each treatment group.  Incidence rates will also be displayed for each treatment group for study drug -related TEAEs and by severity.  Incidence rates of SAEs will also be shown for 
each treatment group.  All incidence rates will be cate gorized and displayed by system organ 
class and preferred term.  
15.6.5. Health Economic Outcomes  
Health economic outcomes will be summarized or tabulated as appropriate without testing for a 
treatment difference.  
15.7. Significance Testing  
All statistical comparisons will be at the 5% alpha level.

SL01 -DEL -101_01 19 December 2018 Amendment No. 1 
 
Rationale for Amendment  01 Changes  
The protocol is amended to address comments provided by the United States Food and Drug 
Administration  to the original protocol submitted with the IND Application  
 Summary of Changes  
 
1. The upper bound of the target DLT range was changed to 33%. 
2. The Dose Expansion cohorts may be opened to enroll subjects in parallel with the Dose 
Escalation coh orts. Clarified that only dose levels that have been cleared for safety 
(permitted to escalate per the Keyboard Design rules) with a minimum of 6 subjects treated at that dose level  can be expanded . 
3. Since Grade 3 cytokine rel ease syndrome ( CRS ) requires dose reduction and may 
result in discontinuation of investigational product (IP), the protocol was modif ied to 
include G rade ≥3 C RS as a DLT.  
4. Modif ied the protocol’s guidance for CRS  to ensure subject safety :  
For any grade C RS 
a. Subject s will be admitted for close observation.  
For Grade 2 CR S 
b. All doses of IP are held  until CRS  has returned to G rade ≤1 for at least 3 days.  
c. Following a Grade 2 C RS event , the next two doses of SL-279252 must be 
administered in an inpatient setting.  
d. For continued treatment following a Grade 2 C RS event , subject s will be 
admitted  to hospital for close observation until resolution of symptoms.  
For Grade 3 CRS  
e. All doses of study medication are held until symptoms have returned to grade 
≤1 for at least 3 days. If the decision is made to continue treatment following resolution, the dose of SL-279252 must be reduced one dose level and premedication with high dose steroids must be administered prior to the first 
dose following Grade 3 C RS event . The next two doses of SL-279252 must be 
administered with appropriate inpatient monitoring (e.g., observation for 24 
hours following infusion when receiving premedication).  
f. Any subject that experiences recurrence of Grade 3 CRS following re- treatment 
must be permanently discontinued from study treatment.

SL01 -DEL -101_01 19 December 2018 Amendment No. 1 
5. The protocol was modified so that dose escalation between the second and third dose 
levels is a half -log increment (i.e., 0.0001 mg/kg, 0.001 mg/kg, 0.003 mg/kg, 0.01 
mg/kg, etc. instead of  a log increment  i.e., 0.0001 mg/kg, 0.001 mg/kg, 0.01 mg/kg, etc.)  
6. Modified dose escalation scheme such that dose level 9 corresponds to a dose of 3.0 
mg/kg of SL-279252 and dose level 10 corresponds to a dose of 6.0 mg/kg of SL -279252 
7. Modi fied ADA  sampling schedule so that  subjects  who test positive for ADA while on 
study or within 7 -30 days after  receiving their  last dose of SL -279252 will undergo 
periodic testing for ADA until levels return  to baseline.  
 
Administrative Changes (28-March 2019): 
1. Added the EUDRACT and NCT numbers to the protocol title page  and removed other 
as an option for adding another numeric identifier  of the protocol.  
2. Corrected protocol number from SL01- DEL -01 to SL01- DEL -101 in the header of the  
summary of changes header. 
3. No content changes were  made to the protocol.

Rationale for Country -specific Amendment  02 for Belgium   
The protocol is amended to address comments provided by the Belgium Regulatory Authorit y 
to Amendment 01 of the protocol. 
 Summary of Changes  
 
1. Removed the barrier method of contraception as an option for  female subjects  of child 
bearing potential. This method, of contraception  does not meet criteria of <1%  failure 
rate for preventing pregnancy .   
2. SL-279252 treatment may induce cytokine s including IL -6 which can inhibit the activity 
of cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzymes  as described in the literature (Evers  et al., 1013, 
Drug Metabolism and Disposition). A cautionary medications section  was added to  the 
protocol to address a potential drug- drug interaction of SL -279252 with concomitant 
medications  that are CYP 450 substrates .  SL-279252 may induce cytokine re lease and 
coincidentally  increas e blood levels of drugs that are CYP 450 substrates.

Rationale for Amendment 0 3   
The protocol is amended to include changes requested  by the Belgium Regulatory Authority 
into the global protocol for consistency across the study. Amendment 02 was a country- specific 
amendment for Belgium. The summary  of changes for  Amendment 02 are provided in Appendix 
16.10. Additionally, A mendment 03 incorporates pharmacodynamic cohorts  during  Dose 
Escalation , in order to obtain additional pharmacodynamic data  at a dose level that ha s 
previously completed evaluation for safety and has not exceeded the MTD .  Collection of 
additional blood samples for receptor occupancy and immunophenotyping has been added in 
Cycle 1 (receptor occupancy in dose expansion cohorts) and Cycle 2 (receptor occupancy and immunophenotyping in all subjects) to characterize pharmacodynamics at time  points that will 
be helpful to inform the recommended phase 2 dose and schedule.  Minor c hanges to the study 
objectives and statistical plans  are made to clarify planned analys es.  Editorial changes  are 
included to remove unclear text or further clarify text (e.g., definitions of study populations, 
etc), and for consistency . Sample size estimates, objectives and endpoints, biomarker sample 
collection time points and other modifications are included to account for  additional 
pharmacodynamic an d other planned study assessments.   
 
Summary  of Changes for Global Amendment  
1. Amendment 02 changes included for countries outside of Belgium 
2. Pharmacodynamic cohorts are now included for enrollment during dose escalation. 
3. Editorial changes to remove unclear text and to further clarify intent of study plans  are 
provided throughout the document to statistical plans, definitions of study populations , etc) . 
a) Time to tumor response added as an endpoint for assessment of antitumor activity ,  
b) Minor response removed for subjects with lymphoma as part of the clinical benefit rate  
definition ; 
c) iSD as part of clinical benefit rate  defined as ≥ 16 weeks  duration instead of ≥ 12 weeks  
d) Refined definitions of popul ations under study in statistical section  
e) Revised sample size estimates to accommodate the addition of pharmacodynamic 
cohorts for enrollment during dose escalation 
f) Clarification of MTD selection based on isotonic estimate  
4. Receptor occupancy samples will also be collected in dose expansion cohorts (no longer 
limited to collection in dose escalation cohorts).  
5. Additional time points for collection of biomarker samples (immunophenotyping and 
receptor occupancy) in  cycle 2 on days 15 and 16 have been added that impact schedule of 
assessment and supplementary tables for dose escalation and dose expansion cohorts.

Rationale for Global Amendment 05   
The main purpose for this amendment is to revise eligibility criteria and tumor types included for study 
participation. The dosing day window for administration of SL -279252 was clarified in the S chedule of 
Assessment  (SOA)  tables . The dose escalation plan table w as revised to include infusion time windows  
for administration of SL -279252.  In addition, p redose, end of infusion (EOI)  and 6 hour post EOI PK 
sample time points were added for collection on C4/D1 to confirm clearance and  half-life parameters 
with repeat dosing of SL -279252. Language was  added that clarifies protocol procedures to follow for 
assessment of AE severity and for recording and reporting AEs. M inor editorial  text changes are also 
included with this amendment.

SL01 -DEL -101_06 4 February 2021  Amendment No. 6 
Rationale for Global Amendment 0 6   
The main purpose for this amendment is to revise exclusion criterion #2 to provide an exception for 
subjects with uveal melanoma, to clarify language a bout ad hoc samples to be collected if an infusion -
related or cytokine release adverse reaction occurs, and to clarify  the DLT -evaluable population for 
subjects receiving SL-279252 therapy on Schedule 2.

Rationale for Global Amendment 0 7   
The main purpose for this amendment is to institute the requirement that eligible subjects have tumors 
with PD-L1 expression ≥1%  according  to tumor proportion score ( TPS) or combined proportion score 
(CPS) .  PD-L1 is a target of the PD1 portion of bifunctional fusion protein SL -279252.  Restri cting 
enrollment to subjects whose tumors demonstrate expression of PD -L1 may improve the likelihood of 
subject benefit.  In addition, subjects with uveal or ocular  melanoma are ineligible for participation.   
 
The description of the drug product is changed to remove reference to a 1 mL fill volume since a larger 
fill volume is planned to ease dose preparation.  Drug product fill volumes will be described in the Study 
Pharmacy Manual.  The length of time to thaw a vial is also removed since it is obvious whe n the frozen 
solution is completely thawed and the time will vary based on fill volume.  
 
Minor editorial changes were made to clarify study conduct procedures during dose escalation and 
requirements for collection of ad hoc labs if IRR and/or CRS occur.

 PROTOCOL SYNOPSIS  
Sponsor  Shattuck Labs  
Product  Name  SL-279252  
Other Names  PD1-Fc-OX40L recombinant fusion glycoprotein  
Protocol  Title  Phase 1 Dose Escalation and Dose Expansion 
Study of an Agonist Redirected Checkpoint Fusion 
Protein, SL -279252 (PD1 -Fc-OX40L), in Subjects 
with Advanced Solid Tumors or Lymphomas  
Protocol Number  SL01 -DEL -101 
Clinical Phase  Phase 1  
Planned Sample Size  Approximately 78 to 93 subjects  
Planned Number of Sites & Countries  8-10 clinical sites;  
United States, Canada, Belgium and Spain  
Recruitment Duration:  24 months ( 2 years ) 
Study Duration  32 months (< 3 years)  
Background and Rationale  
The investigational product (IP), SL-279252 , is a first -in-class agonist redirected checkpoint 
(ARC)  fusion protein (FP) consisting of the extracellular domain s of human programmed cell 
death 1 ( PD- 1) and OX40L, linked by a centr al Fc domain (PD1 -Fc-OX40L). The mechanism 
of action of SL -279252 is designed to intercept one of the key immunosuppressive pathways 
within the tumor microenvironment ( TME) : the PD -1 – p rogrammed cell death 
ligand 1/programme d cell death -ligand 2 axis  (PD-L1/PD -L2). SL-279252 can bind to PD -L1 
and PD -L2 expressed on tumor and antigen presenting cells, and replace that inhibitory signal 
with OX40L, resulting in an incoming T cell experiencing co -stimulation via engagement 
through its OX40 receptor inste ad of suppression through PD -1 interactions. Importantly, 
because the extracellular domains ( ECDs ) of PD -1 and OX40L are physically linked to one 
another and localized to the TME, tumor infiltrating T cells will receive co -stimulation at the 
same time they  recognize a tumor antigen via the T cell receptor ( TCR ).  
 
SL-279252 is able to bind with high affinity to both targets simultaneously and stimulate anti -
tumor T cell activity. The PD -1 end of the fusion protein binds PD -L1 and PD -L2 with affinities 
of 2.08 and 1.76 nM, respectively, and the  OX40L end binds OX40 w ith an affinity of 246 pM.  
The PD -1 domain efficiently outcompetes PD -L1 blocking antibodies for ligand binding, and 
the OX40L domain potently stimulates OX40- mediated nuclear factor kappa B signaling in a 
luciferase- based reporter assay . When activated human T cells were co -cultured with PD -L1 
positive human tumor cells, SL -279252 enhanced proliferation of T cells and production of 
interleukin  (IL)-2, interferon- gamma (IFNγ) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF -α), which 
led to efficient killing of tumor cells.   
 
SL-279252 was compared to sequence equivalents of nivolumab, pembrolizumab and 
tavolixizumab in several in vitro functional assays using human lymphocytes in the presence of Staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB) : higher concentrations of cytokine s were released with   
SL- 279252 than with the antibodies alone or in combination with one another.  The murine 
version of SL-279252 (mPD1- Fc-OX40L) was studied head- to-head with mouse PD-1/L1 and

 Background and Rationale (continued)  
OX40 antibodies both alone and in combination and led to improved tumor control and rejection 
rates as compared to the antibody combinations in multiple models.    SL-279252 is a pharmacologically active molecule. In the non- human primate (NHP) studies, 
dose-dependent infusion- related reactions (IRRs) were the primary toxicity of concern. These 
adverse reactions  were immune- mediated and multifactorial in etiology consistent with target -
mediated pharmacology of SL -279252 as well as immunogenicity (anti -drug antibodies ( ADA), 
complement activation) related effects . Collectively , the effects at 40 and 80 mg/kg/dose were 
considered adverse and the effects at 10 mg/kg/dose were not considered adverse. The highest non-severely toxic dose ( HNSTD) of SL -279252 was determined to  be 10 mg/kg. 
 
The preclinical  and nonclinical data  collectively  suggest that SL -279252 has unique 
immunological properties, with the potential for anti- tumor activity . This first -in-human, Phase 
1 trial will assess the safety, tolerability , PK, pharmacodynamics and anti -tumor activity of SL -
279252 in subjects with tumor types that have been documented to respond to anti -PD-1/PD -L1 
therapy . All subjects enrolled in this trial are required to have received or been intolerant to 
standard of care therapies.  The m ajority of subjects w ill also have received PD -1/L1 and/or 
cytotoxic T cell lymphocyte -associated antigen 4  (CTLA -4) inhibitors and progressed.   
Study Objectives  
Primary Objectives  Outcome Measures  
Dose Escalation :  
To evaluate the safety and tolerability and to identify the maximum-
tolerated dose 
(MTD) or maximum administered dose 
(MAD) of SL -279252 in subjects with  
select  locally advanced or metastatic 
malignancies  (i.e., solid tu mors or 
lymphomas)  
   
Dose Expansion:  To further refine the 
safety and tolerability of SL -279252 in 
subjects with select locally advanced or 
metastatic  select  malignancies (i.e., solid 
tumors or lymphomas) 
 Safety/tolerability outcomes include:  
Incidence of all adverse events (AE s) and 
immune -related adverse events (irAE s), serious 
adverse events (SAE s), fatal SAE s, dose limiting 
toxicity ( DLT ), AE and irAE s leading to 
discontinuation; changes in safety assessments 
(e.g., laboratory parameters, vital sign s, etc.) per 
the National Cancer Institute Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI -
CTCAE – version [v]) 5.0). 
 Dose Escalation : The MTD is defined based on 
the rate of DLTs and the MAD is the highest dose administered.  
Dose Expansion : Infusion- related reactions 
(IRRs ) and discontinuation of SL -279252 will be 
closely monitored using sequential boundaries.  
Secondary Objectives  Outcome Measures  
Dose Escalation and Dose Expansion:  
To select the dose and schedule i.e.,  
recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) for 
SL-279252 Based on review of data collected during dose 
escalation and expansion, including safety, 
tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), anti -tumor 
activity outcomes, pharmacodynamic outcomes.

outcomes as described above 
Study Design  
This is a Phase 1 first in human, open label, multi -center, dose escalation and dose expansion 
study to e valuate the safety, tolerability, PK, anti- tumor activity and pharmacodynamic effects 
of SL -279252 in subjects with selected locally advanced or metastatic malignancies. The study 
design consists of Dose Escalation (Section 3.2) and Dose Expansion Cohorts (Section 3.3 ).  In 
the dose escalation phase of the study, subjects will be enrolled into sequential dose levels (DL) 
as outlined in Section 3.2.4 and Table 5. Enrollment into a DL cohort will follow the Keyboard Design outlined in the Appendix, Section 16.3  [Yan, 2017
].  During dose escalation, two 
possible schedules (Schedule 1 and Schedule 2) for administration of SL -279252 may be 
explored as outlined in Section 3.2.4 .  Schedule 1 will be evaluated first. A transition to 
Schedule 2 may be implemented for reasons outlined in Section 3.2.7 .  If Schedule 2 is opened, 
the Sponsor may also elect to stop enrollment in Schedule 2 early (e.g., based on safety) and 
CONFIDENTIAL    SL01 -DEL -101 
Compound: SL-279252  Version no: 07

 resume enrollment in Schedule 1.  The MTD or MAD may be determined for either Schedule 1 
or Schedule 2. Alternatively, a less intensive dosing schedule may be instituted if safety and 
pharmacodynamic data on Schedule 1 support less frequent dosing of SL -279252 (e.g., one dose 
given every two weeks or every three weeks or every four weeks).   
 
Based o n accumulating data from the dose escalation phase, including safety, PK, 
pharmacodynamic and anti -tumor activity, up to two dose expansion cohorts may be opened. 
The primary objective of the expansion phase is to further refine the safety and tolerability of 
SL-279252. One or two expansion cohorts will evaluate doses of SL -279252 using one  selected 
schedule. At the end of dose escalation  and dose expansion, safety, PK,  anti-tumor activity , and 
pharmacodynamic data will be reviewed to identify the RP2D. 
 
Treatment  Schedule  
Two or more dosing schedules for SL -279252 may be evaluated:  
• Schedule 1: will determine the safety of administering SL -279252 on days 1, 8 and 15 
of the first 28 -day cycle and then every 2 weeks thereafter on days 1 and 15 of each 28-
day cycle beginning with cycle 2. 
• Schedule 2: will determine the safety of weekly dosing of SL-279252 on days 1, 8, 15 
and 22 of each 28- day cycle.  
A less frequent dosing schedule (e.g., once every three weeks) may be investigated if safety 
data from Schedule 1 indicate this approach is most prudent    
Dose Escalation Scheme

Level 1  0.0001 mg/kg  5-30 minutes  
Level 2  0.001 mg/kg  5-30 minutes  
Level 3  0.003 mg/kg  5-30 minutes  
Level 4  0.01 mg/kg  30 minutes (+/ - 10 minutes)  
Level 5  0.03 mg/kg  30 minutes (+/ - 10 minutes)  
Level 6  0.1 mg/kg  30 minutes (+/ - 10 minutes)

Level 9  3.0 mg/kg  1 hour (+/ - 15 minutes)  
Level 10  6.0 mg/kg  1 hour (+/ - 15 minutes)  
a) Dose escalation begins on Schedule 1 : SL- 279252 may be administered in the first cycle on days 1, 
8, and 15 of the first  28-day cycle and then once every 2 weeks on days 1 and 15 of  each 28-day 
cycle beginning at cycle 2. 
b) Dose  escalation  on Schedule 2 may be tested : If Schedule 2 is opened, SL -279252 will be 
administered once weekly on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of each  28-day cycle. The starting dose on 
schedule 2 will be at least one dose level below the current Schedule 1 dose level defined by the 
Keyboard design. If Schedule 2 is opened for enrollment, then enrollment on Schedule 1 will be 
halted.  
CONFIDENTIAL    SL01 -DEL -101

29 
 c) Intermediate dose levels may be tested based on emerging safety data. The option to explore more 
than 10 dose levels on Schedule 1 or additional dose levels on Schedule 2 is also a possibility if safety 
allows. Escalations will not exceed half -log increments after dose level 2. 
d) The actual body weight in kg will be used for dose calculation in all subjects whose body weight is 
≤100 kg.  For subjects with body weight >100 kg, the dose to be administered should be the same as 
that calculated for a subject weighing 100 kg (See Sections 5.2.3 and 5.4 for details)  
e) Infusion time may change based on final drug volume needed for administration, safety and 
tolerability of the infusion for the subject, and/or observed safety findings during the study. Please 
refer to the Study Pharmacy Manual (SPM) for details.  
Definition of Dose Limiting Toxicity  
Dose limiting toxicities ( DLTs ) are defined in the bulleted points below.  Toxicities will be graded as per 
NCI CTCAE v5.  The determinate period for DLT is the first 21 days  or 28 days of treatment on Schedule 
1 or Schedule 2, respectively. However, there is provision in the criteria b elow for toxicities that occur 
beyond this period to be considered in the definition of the RP2D. Note : Toxicities clearly related to 
disease progression or intercurrent illness are not considered DLTs.  Inflammatory reactions attributable 
to local anti- tumor responses (e.g., severe pain) are not considered DLTs.

 1. INTRODUCTION, BACKGROUND AND STUDY RATIONALE  
1.1 Background Information 
The human immune system can prevent the initiation of cancer through constant immune 
surveillance or immunoediting, whereby nascent transformed cells are recognized by the immune system and eliminated, often preventing tumor outgrowth and metastasis [Schreiber, 2011; 
Muenst, 2016] . When cancer does arise, immunoediting results in an adaptive response within 
tumors, and the tumor microenvironment (TME), to co- opt endogenous immune suppressive 
pathways that provide an extrinsic survival advantage to the tumor cells through inhibition  of the 
immune system. Thus, cancers avoid immune surveillance and destruction through multiple mechanisms including (but not limited to) downregulation of costimulatory signals required for lymphocyte activation, and upregulation of inhibitory signals essential for preventing autoimmunity, thereby circumventing the immune system’s ability to recognize tumor cells.  Immune evasion is therefore an extrinsic hallmark of cancer, just as pro- survival or pro-growth 
mutations in tumor suppressor genes or oncogene s, respectively, are intrinsic hallmarks of cancer 
[Hanahan, 2011] .  Advancements in our understanding of the mechanisms responsible for cancer 
immune evasion has led to the development of therapies that have shown promise  in overcoming 
tumor-mediated immune suppression.   
In general, cancer immunotherapy encompasses a broad spectrum of approaches that  either  target  
tumor cells directly  (e.g., monoclonal antibodies  [mAbs], radioimmunotherapy, antibody drug 
conjugates, and immunotoxins/oncolytic viruses) or  activate immune cells  to kill cancer cells  (e.g., 
vaccines, cellular  therapies,  checkpoint antagonist s and stimulatory agonist s) [Sathyanarayanan, 
2015] .  Recent strategies in immunotherapy have focused on therapeutic interventions that 
modulate pathways governing T cell activation to overcome cancer immune evasion.  For example, 
checkpoint antagonist s, or immune checkpoint inhibitors , are agents that block receptors or ligands 
involved in attenuating T cell activation . Stimulatory agonist s are agents that engage co -
stimulatory pathways  and immune receptors  and lead to the activation and proliferation of  T cells.  
Over the past decade, pharmaceutical research efforts have  focused intently on developing 
immunotherapy drugs that  either  inhibit immune checkpoint  molecules responsible for T cell 
anergy  or stimulate tumor necrosis factor receptor ( TNFR ) pathways linked to T cell activation.    
The cytotoxic T cell lymphocyte- associated antigen 4 (CTLA -4) and the programmed cell death 
protein 1 (PD-1) pathways are major negative regulators of T cell receptor (TCR) signaling.  These 
pathways are  engaged by tumor cells to avoid immune surveillance by T cells. Targeted inhibitors 
of CTLA -4, PD -1 or PD -ligand ( L)1 are immune checkpoint inhibitors that have demonstrated 
efficacy in many tumor types [ Postow, 2015] .  Moreover, s ince multiple inhibitory receptors  and 
soluble factors are involved i n T cell exhaustion  in the TME apart from PD -1 and CTLA -4, such 
as T cell immunoglobulin mucin 3 (TIM -3), lymphocyte activation gene 3 (LAG -3) protein, and 
the T- cell immunoglobulin and immunoreceptor tyrosine -based inhibition motif ( ITIM ) domain 
(TIGIT)  protein among others; a surge in pre -clinical/clinical development of these  next 
generation -checkpoint inhibitors has occurred  (Table 1)  [Mahoney, 2015]. 
Agents that engage co-stimulatory pathways that lead to the proliferation and activation of T cells 
are also being evaluated in clinical trials.  Essentially, optimal T -cell activation requires two  
CONFIDENTIAL    SL01 -DEL -101 
Compound: SL-279252  Version no: 07  
35 
 signaling events  that prime  these cells  for activation  [Sturgill ER, 2017] .  Signal 1 occurs when 
the TCR binds antigenic peptides presented by the major histocompatibility complex on the surface 
of antigen presenting cells (APC). Signal 2 involves the  engagement of cluster of differentiation 
(CD)28 on the T cell with B7 -1(CD80) and B7-2(CD86) receptors  on APCs; together these  signals 
constitute the  minimal co-stimulatory signals necessary  for T cell  activation . In addition, co-
stimulatory signals via tumor necrosis factor receptors ( TNFRs ) are necessary to drive T cell  
differentiation/proliferation and potentiate the development of memory and effector  subsets .  
TNFRs responsible for transducing the additional co- stimulatory signals  needed for T cell 
activation  include OX40 (CD134, tumor necrosis factor receptor superfam ily [ TNFRSF] 4), 
glucocorticoid- induced TNFR  (GITR , CD357, TNFRSF18),  CD27  (TNFRSF7) , and 4 -1BB 
(CD137, TNFRSF9 ). The orchestration of these signaling events enables robust tumor killing 
activity  by T cells  in vivo .  To exploit this imp ortant co -stimulatory cascade, a gonist mAbs or 
ligands targeting TNFR s are in various stages of preclinical and clinical development for cancer 
(Table 1).

[Mahoney, 2015; Sturgill ER, 2017; Rataj, 2018] 
Much excitement was generated when  the first in class  immune checkpoint inhibitors entered the 
clinic and elicited anti -tumor r esponse s in patients with cancer [ Postow, 2015] . Despite the initial 
success  of PD -1/L1 and CTLA -4 inhibitors , clinical benefit as monotherapy occur s in a minority 
of patients (objectives responses in 10-45% with long term survival benefit in 20-30%) . This has 
made the search for synergistic combinations or novel approaches an immediate priority. Along 
these lines, the first checkpoint -checkpoint combi nation of ipilimumab (CTLA -4 inhibitor ) and 
nivolumab (PD -1 inhibitor ) demonstrated improved response rates, progression free survival and 
overall survival compared to single agent therapy  in late-stage melanoma albeit , with a high rate 
of severe toxicitie s [Larkin, 2015a ; Larkin, 2015b; Boutros, 2016].  The use of other combination 
strategies pairing checkpoint inhibitors with stimulatory agonist s are being explored in many 
ongoi ng clinical trials [ Sturgill ER, 2017] . However, a critical issue is how best to combine  and 
sequence these agents to elicit robust T cell responses against tumors.  
Although combination immunotherapy can imp rove efficacy, developing novel treatment 
strategies remains a formidable task given the complexity of the human immune system and the 
potential for toxicity which may result from such interventions  [Andrews, 2015] .  Moreover, as 
only a proportion of patients benefit from these therapies , there is a need for systematic biomarker -
driven approaches to identify patients most likely to respond to combination regimens targeting the immune system.

 In an attempt to improve upon current paradigms, Shattuck Labs has developed  a bifunctional 
fusio n protein (FP) platform, capable of simultaneously blocking ‘checkpoints’ while activating  
TNFR co -stimulators. Shattuck’s A gonist R edirected Checkpoint (ARC) platform adjoins the 
extracellular domain (ECD) of a select t ype 1 membrane protein to the ECD of  a select t ype 2 
membrane protein, via a central Fc domain . Using this approach, combination immunotherapy can 
be achieved by a single FP , having superior preclinical activity  compared to  the separate 
administration of two individual antibodies against ide ntical targets . 
1.2 Investigational Product, SL-279252  
The investigational product  (IP), SL-279252, is a first -in-class ARC FP  consisting of the ECDs of 
human PD -1 and OX40L, linked by a central Fc domain (PD1- Fc-OX40L). The preclinical data 
support ing the  translational study of SL -279252 in human subjects with cancer is described i n 
detail in the Investigator’s Brochure  (IB) [SL2018IB001_01] .  The mechanism of action, in vitro  
and in vivo pharmacology, toxicokinetics  (TK), and the rationale for investigation are briefly 
summarized below.  
1.2.1 Mechanism of Action  
The mechanism of action of SL -279252 is designed to intercept one of the key immunosuppressive 
pathways within the TME: the PD -1 - PD-L1/PD -L2 axis. SL -279252 can bind to PD -L1 and PD -
L2 expressed on tumor and antigen- presenting cells , and replace that inhibitory signal with 
OX40L, resulting in an incoming T cell experiencing co- stimulation via engagement through its 
OX40 receptor ( Figure 1 ) instead of suppression through PD -1 interactions. Importantly, because 
the ECDs of PD -1 and OX40L are physically linked to one another and localized to the TME, 
tumor infiltr ating T cells will receive co -stimulation at the same time they recognize a tumor 
antigen via the TCR.

 1.2.2 In Vitro Pharmacology 
The PD -1 end of SL -279252, binds PD -L1 and PD -L2 with affinities  of 2.08 and 1.76 nanomolar 
(nM) , respectively, and the OX40L end binds OX40 with an affinity of 246 picomolar (pM).  The 
PD1-Fc-OX40L ARC was also observed to have a considerably longer receptor off-rate constant 
(Kd) than control proteins  (PD1 -Fc and OX40L -Fc) when the dissociation from PD -L1 (18 -fold 
longer), PD-L2 (13.4 fold longer) and OX40 (36-fold longer) was determined.  The PD -1 domain 
efficiently out competes PD -L1 blocking antibodies for ligand binding, and the OX40L domain 
potently stimulates  OX40 -mediated  nuclear factor kappa B  signaling in a luciferase -based reporter 
assay.  Furthermore, when activated human T cells were co -cultured with PD -L1 positive human 
tumor cells, SL -279252 enhanced proliferation of T cells and production of interleukin (IL)-2 ), 
interferon -gamma (IFNγ) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF -α), which led to efficient killing 
of tumor cells.   
1.2.3 In Vivo Pharmacology 
The anti -tumor activity of the murine equivalent of SL -279252 (mPD1 -Fc-OX40L) in established 
murine tumors was significantly superior to either PD -1 blocking, OX40 agonist, or combination 
antibody therapy. SL -279252 was shown to provide higher rates of tumor rejection and long- term 
immunity to tumor re -challenge than any of the antibody treatments in preclinical tumor models , 
including expansion of tumor antigen specific CD8 T cells. The SL-279252 drug product is a 
combination of trimers and hexamers resulting in highly potent signaling.  Thus , all agonist 
functions of SL -279252 are independent of Fc receptor cross -linking. Collectively, preclinical data 
demonstrate a highly potent FP platform, providing checkpoint blockade and TNFRSF co-
stimulation in a single molecule.   
1.2.4 Toxicology  
The cynomolgus macaque  was selected for the toxicology studies due to the cross -reactivity of 
SL-279252 to the respective targets in this species.  The anatomical, physiological, and 
biochemical similarities to humans facilitate extrapolation of observed pharmacokinetic ( PK) 
properties to human.  
Toxicology studies in non-human primate s (NHP)  (Table 2) were designed to evaluate the toxicity 
and identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and TK of SL -279252 in cynomolgus monkeys  
following repeated weekly administrations ( see the SL -279252 IB for further details ).  Repeat  dose 
studies consisted of a  dose range finding (DRF)  study (2 Table 2A) and a Good 
Laboratory Practice ( GLP ) toxici ty study ( Table 2B). In both repeat dose studies, SL -
279252 was administered intravenous  (IV), once  weekly , for up to 5 weeks. The doses evaluated 
in DRF study  and GLP study  were 3, 10, 50, and 100 milligrams per kilogram 
(mg/kg) , and 10, 40, and 80 mg/kg, respectively. The GLP study included a vehicle control group.  
The GLP toxicity study also sought to evaluate the reversibility, progression or delayed appearance 
of any observed changes following a four week recovery period.

Across both studies, infusion- related reactions  (IRRs)  were the primary toxicity of concern.  IRR s 
appeared to be dose- and time -dependent and were observed in GLP study  at 40 and 80 
mg/kg doses in 4/6 and 9/10 animals, respectively . The IRR first occurred  during or within 15 
minutes (min) of the start of infusion (SOI)  of the third dose of SL -279252. The manifestations of 
these reactions (decreased activity, flaccid limbs, pale gums/face, constricted pupils, closed 
eyelids, salivation, skin cold to touch, increased respiratory rate) were similar across animals and 
ranged in severity from mild t o severe.  
Deaths attributable to SL -279252 were noted in GLP study at the 40  mg/kg and 80 mg/kg 
doses in 1/6 and 6/10 animals, respectively. Deaths occurred at  the 5th dose in the 40 mg/kg cohort 
and at the 3rd and 4th dose in the 80 mg/kg cohort ( Table 3).  In DRF study , an  IRR was 
observed after the 4th dose in 1 of 2 animals at the 100 mg/kg dose level.  The onset and 
presentation were consistent with IRRs observed in GLP study . 
Although severity and tissue distribution of histopathology findings were variable among affected 
animals, some consistency was noted in the type of findings and the organ/tissue distribution i n 
the mid and highe r dose group animals (≥40 mg/kg/dose) following repeat dose administ ration  of 
SL-279252. These included vascular/sinusoidal leukocytosis, fibrin deposits mixed with 
predominant population of neutrophils, lymphocytes, and monocytes within vessels of lung, liver 
and/or kidney. Correlating laboratory findings were noted in affected animals. For the animals that 
died (Table 3), the cause of morbidity or euthanasia was due to leukocyte infiltration within the 
vascular lumina (vascular leukocytosis) as noted in the lungs, kidneys and liver sinusoids.

All animals tested screened negative for anti -drug antibodies ( ADA) prior to dosing, and all 
animals in the vehicle group remained negative for ADA throughout the study. In contrast, all 
treated animals except for one screened positive for ADA prior to receiving the 3rd dose. All treated 
animals were positive for ADA prior to the 4th dose. For the two animals that demonstrated 
consumptive coagulopathy and were euthanized in extremis  following the 3rd dose or 4th dose, the 
ADA titer was observed to decrease following dosing, which may have been due to immune 
complex for mation.  Overall, infusion reactions were associated with the formation of an ADA 
response by the time the 3rd dose was  administered; however, the ADA titer did not correlate with 
the occurrence of an infusion reaction. 
Cytokine levels were measured in both the  (Day  1, 29) and  (Day 1, 
8, 15, 29) studies  . There was evidence  of an SL -279252- related increase  in multiple cytokines , 
primarily interleukin -1 receptor antagonist , IL-10, IL -6 and monocyt e chemoattractant protein -1 
with lesser and more inconsistent increases in IL-18, IL-5, and macrophage inflammatory protein-

 1b. Cytokine effects tended to peak at 2 hours postdose with resolution in most cases by 24 hours 
postdose , although occasional increased cytokine levels were seen at the 80 mg/kg/dose at one or 
more predose intervals (Days 8, 15, or 29). The magnitude of cytokine increases tended to follow 
a dose response, and often became more pronounced following the 3rd dose at which point all but 
one animal had developed ADA . No discernable effects on IFN-γ, IL-2, IL-4, IL-17-α, or TNF -α 
were identified in any group. In general, the profile of cytokines elevated is consist ent with a T 
helper 2 -type immune response .  This profile  could be consistent with OX40 activation in CD4+ 
T cells  but interpretation is confounded by the presence of ADA. 
Complement activation was also measured in both the  (Day  22, 29) and 
 study ( Day 1, 8, 15, 29). Complement analysis demonstrated evidence o f dose -related and 
progressive SL -279252 related complement  activation at all dose levels as indicated by increases 
in split products Bb, C3a, and/or SC5b-9. The se effects tended to peak at 2  hours post -dose with 
resolution in most cases by 24 hours post -dose. The magnitude of the effects tended to follow a 
dose response. Effects were observed following the first dose in all animals, with vehicle and 10 mg/kg dose gr oups showing mild elevation, while higher elevations were observed in the 
40 mg/kg and 80 mg/kg dose groups.  The magnitude of increase  among complement endpoints 
tended to become more pronounced following the 3
rd dose, with the effect also noted at the 10  
mg/kg dose level and persisting through the 24-hour post-dose interval.   
The bioanalytical assay measured only free, unbound SL -279525 and the TK results demonstrated 
targeted -mediated drug disposition (TMDD) following a single dose as there was a decrease in 
clearance (CL) and volume of distribution ( Vz) with an increase in dose from 3 to 100 mg/kg. The 
apparent TMDD observed following the first dose was likely due to  binding of SL -279252 to 
targeted receptors on the peripheral blood lymphocytes. T he serum  terminal phase half-life (t½) 
ranged from approximately 12 to 25 hours over doses ranging from 3 to 100 mg/kg for the 
combined DRF and GLP toxicology study. Interestingly, SL -279252 was detected on peripheral 
blood lymphocytes by flow cytometry up to 7 days post -infusion and by Day 15 was accompanied 
by expansion of OX40 positive lymphocytes and a consistent serum cytokine signature.  Based on 
the evidence of TMDD likely related to binding to receptors localized on peripheral blood lymphocytes, CL of SL -279252 may be affected by changes to lymphocyte count and/or receptor 
density. The TK profiles observed on Day 29 following weekly administration of SL -279252 were 
atypical with rapid clearance of free SL -279252.  By Day 29, all animals in the DRF and GLP 
toxicity study tested positive for ADA which likely explains the rapid clearance observed 
following administration on Day 29. 
Taken together  the findings from  the DRF  and GLP  studies  were suggestive  
of expected target -mediated pharmacology as well as immunogenicity related effects which led to 
dose-dependent toxicity.  The immune effects were considered to be multifactorial in etiology with 
potential contributions from cytokine increase, complement binding and ADA- mediated effects.  
Collectively , the effects at 40 and 80 mg/kg/dose were considered adverse and the effects at 10 
mg/kg/dose were not considered adverse. The highest non- severely toxic dose  (HNSTD) was 
determined to be 10 mg/kg.

 1.3 Rationale 
The preclinical data package provided in the IB  [SL2018IB001_01]  demonstrates that the tethering  
of these two signals  using an ARC provides a mechanistic  advantage over the separate 
administration of two antibodies that have different PK properties, distribute separately, and may 
compete for Fc receptor binding. We hypothesize that co -localization and co -stimulation is critical 
for combination immunotherapy and will result in superior clinical activity in comparison to the separate administration of two individual antibodies. In addition, SL -279252 has a strong 
specificity advantage over mAbs targeting a specific co -stimulatory ligand (i.e. , PD-L1 inhibitors 
like atezolizumab , avelumab, and durvalumab), when multiple ligands exist for a given target and 
can all (at least partially) contribute to the overall immunosuppressive environment. For example, blocking only PD -L1 does not preclude an incoming T cell from becoming suppressed when its 
membrane bound PD -1 interacts with tumor expressed PD -L2.  SL -279252 binds to PD -L2 with 
similar affinity as it does to PD -L1 and is able to occupy/block both ligand binding sites.  
SL-279252 also overcomes several major fu nctional limitations seen with existing bifunctional 
technologies (i.e., bispecific antibodies or linked single- chain variable fragment [ scFv ] molecules). 
The active unit of SL -279252 exists as a glycosylated multimer, thereby retaining high target 
avidity , and inducing OX40 receptor clustering and active signaling.  The TNF superfamily 
receptors (i.e. , OX40, GITR, 4 -1BB) require clustering on a cell membrane and coordinated 
binding of multiple receptors for signal activation. With bispecific antibodies or linked scFv molecules, one of the two target binding domains is replaced to bind a second molecule thus resulting in a loss of target avidity.  The monovalent binding interaction with each of these two 
targets is incapable of activating receptors that requ ire clustering on a cell membrane. For this 
reason, there is not a current example of a bispecific antibody or linked scFv that is able to 
simultaneously block a checkpoint ligand while stimulating a TNF costimulatory receptor.  
This first -in-human Phase  1 study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK , anti -tumor and 
pharmacodynamic effects of SL -279252 to identify the dose and schedule i.e., recommended Phase 
2 dose (RP2D) for future development. The trial will enroll patients with tumor types that have  
demonstrated benefit from  anti-PD1/L1 inhibitor therapy i .e., melanoma, non- small cell lung 
cancer (NSCLC), urothelial cancer, head and neck  squamous cell carcinoma  (HNSCC), squamous 
cell cervical cancer, gastric or gastro -esophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma , squamous cell 
carcinoma of the anal canal (SCCA), squamous cell carcinoma of the skin (Skin- SCC), renal cell 
cancer (RCC), Hodgkin’s lymphoma (HL), and microsatellite instability high (MSI -H) or 
mismatch repair deficient (M MRD) solid tumors  excluding central nervous system (CNS) 
malignancies . Given that SL -279252 likely requires binding of PD -L1 to mediate activity  within 
the tumor, the study was amended to require eligible subjects  to have tumors with PD -L1 
expression ≥1% by tumor proportion score (TPS) or combined proportion score (CPS) at baseline. 
Potential risks to subjects are addressed by safety guidelines and vigilant monitoring of participants 
as outlined in the protocol.  Potential safety concerns are based on preclinical safety toxicology findings in cynomolgus monkeys dosed with SL -279252 and other in vivo or in vitro  studies of 
SL-279252 summarized in the  IB, as well as established clinical management guidelines developed 
for immune checkpoint therapy inhibitors.

 1.4 Potential Risks and Benefits  
1.4.1 Potential Risks  
SL-279252 is a pharmacologically active molecule [SL2018IB001_01] .  The risks (evaluation of 
safety and tolerability) and potential benefits (eva luation of anti -tumor activity) of SL -279252 in 
humans will be assessed for the first time in this Phase 1 clinical trial.  In the absence of data in 
humans , an assessment of potential safety risks is based on (1) the results of nonclinical studies 
with SL-279252 (e.g., NHP  studies); and (2) the immune -related adverse event  (irAE) profile of 
other immune checkpoint inhibitors and costimulatory molecules.   
Based on a thorough review of the totality of the NHP  data (including laboratory studies, cytokine 
and complement data, TK and immunogenicity studies, anatomical pathology) , the underlying 
etiology of the SL -279252- related effects  is most likely due to a combination of both the 
pharmacologic activity of the molecule and to immunologic reactions to SL -279252 
administration. The following are potential contributory factors to these reactions: (1) high levels 
of cytokine release; (2) increase in pre -dose lymphocytes; (3) development of ADA; and /or (4) 
complement activation.   
Implications for the first- in-human clinical trial [ SL2018IB001_01] : 
1) The data indicate a potential risk for cytokine release syndrome  (CRS)  in humans. The IRRs 
that were noted in the NHP studies were potentially cytokine- mediated as they demonstrated 
dose- a nd time -dependence. In contrast, antibody- mediated type 1 or type 3 hypersensitivity 
reactions  (HSRs) would not be expected to demonstrate dose -dependence. Furthermore, CRS 
is to be expected given the mechanism of action of SL -279252.  The steps taken to minimize 
the risks include: low starting dose, decreased dose frequency in comparison to the dosing 
schedule for the NHP studies for the first schedule to be evaluated (i.e., Schedule 1) , 
administration in a n outpatient oncology clinic or inpatient setting, management guidelines 
(e.g., rescue treatments, prophylaxis), extended monitoring in a hospital setting and/or hospital 
admission when indicated. The steps taken to minimize the risks are outlined in the Toxicity 
Management Guidelines  section of the protocol ( Section 3.5).  
 
2) Immunogenicity Risk: SL -279252 is considered to have a low risk of immunogenicity in 
humans. To evaluate the risk of immunogenicity in humans, the following 2 in vitro  studies 
were performed: (1) Antitope/Abzena in silico analysis showed that the SL -279252 construct 
did not contain any identifiable T cell epitopes; and (2) EpiScreen™ time course T cell assay assessed the probability for SL -279252 to induce CD4+ T cell responses. No proliferation or 
cytokine release was observed in this assay with peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMCs ) 
from 50 healthy donors .  Subjects in the clinical trial will, nevertheless, be monitored starting 
at baseline and serially for ADA. In the event of a positive ADA response, antibody titer will be measured, and anti body isotype will be characterized. A guideline for monitoring and 
management of HSRs  is included in the protocol (Section 3.5.1). 
 
3) Toxicity secondary to complement  activation: Complement activation secondary to treatment 
with SL -279252 could potentially result in toxicity. In the NHP  studies, SL -279252 caused 
complement activation in vivo, as measured by CH50, C3a, Bb and SC5b9 assays. The 
cynomolgus monkey is a sensitive species for complement activation [ Shen, 2014] . Thus, in 
CONFIDENTIAL    SL01 -DEL -101 
Compound: SL-279252  Version no: 07  
43 
 vitro  assays were perfor med to determine whether SL -279252 directly activated human and/or 
cynomolgus complement proteins. The magnitude of complement activation observed in vitro 
appears to be increased in cynomolgus monkey serum as compared to human serum. It was noted that SL -279252 activated human and cynomolgus complement proteins in vitro at 
concentrations above 15.3 µg/mL. Based on toxicokinetic simulations, less than 1% of subjects will have a serum concentration of SL -279252 exceeding 15.3 microgram/milliliter ( µg/mL ) 
at human doses below 0.3 mg/kg. Patients in the clinical trial will be monitored for complement 
activation at all dose levels.    
 
As with other checkpoint inhibitors and costimulatory molecules, irAEs resulting from a 
breakdown of self -tolerance are anticipat ed with SL -279252. As experience using these therapies 
has grown, the list of toxicities has increased, and the types of AEs observed span essentially every 
organ class.  Extensive knowledge in managing these toxicities has developed over the years and led to the publication of consensus guidelines in p eer reviewed journals [ Haanen, 2017; Puzanov, 
2017; Brahmer, 2018] .  Similarly, robust management guidelines are available for managing CRS 
in the context of treatment with adoptive T -cell therapies, bispecific antibodies, and agonist 
antibodies.  Moreover, clinical trial sites fa miliar with these therapeutic agents have developed 
institutional guidelines to ensure effective management of these toxicities. Monitoring and management of irAE follow these consensus guidelines in this first in human study. 
In summary, this Phase 1 study has taken the following precautions to minimize the potential for 
adverse outcome: (1) the study is being conducted at centers that have extensive experience with 
this class of agents and the management of associated toxicities; (2) the starting dose of SL -279252 
is estimated based on minimum anticipated biological effect level ( MABEL)  and is 100,000x 
lower than the HNSTD observed in the NHP  studies (Section 3.2.3) . Therefore, the starting dose 
is expected to be lower than doses associated with adverse events ( AEs) in humans ; (3) staggered 
enrollment between dose cohorts and within cohorts allows for the monitoring of acute toxicities 
in one subject  before treating another; (4) administration  of SL -279252 in an outpatient oncology 
treatment center/hospital allows for close monitoring of subjects for AEs  and for timely action; (5) 
guidelines for management of AEs based on established guidelines [ Haanen, 2017; Puzanov, 2017 ; 
Rosello, 2017; Brahmer, 2018; Porter, 2018]  are provided in the clinical trial protocol ( Section  
3.5); (6) a Safety Monitoring Committee  (SMC ) will meet monthly and on an ad hoc basis to 
review emerging toxicities, and assess the impact of these toxicities on study conduct. 
1.4.2 Potential Benefits  
The clinical benefits of SL -279252 are unknown: no clinical trials in human subjects have been 
conducted to date. SL -279252 targets both the PD -1/L1 and the OX40/OX40L axes.  M abs 
targeting each of these axes have been extensively evaluated in clinical trials  [Marin -Acevedo, 
2018] .   
PD-1/L1 inhibitors (pembrolizumab, nivolumab, atezolizumab, durvalumab, and avelumab) have 
demonstrated a favorable benefit:risk profile in clinical trials and gained regulatory approval in an 
expanding array of indications . HL harbors genetic alterations in the chromosome 9p24.1 
amplicon, resulting in overexpression of the PD -1 ligands, PD -L1 an d PD -L2 [Roemer, 2016] . 
This makes HL unique among all tumors. The overall response rates in patients with 
CONFIDENTIAL    SL01 -DEL -101 
Compound: SL-279252  Version no: 07  
44 
 relapsed/refractory HL were 87% and 65%, with nivolumab and pembrolizumab, respectively  
[Ansell, 2015; Armand, 2016] .  In other tumor types depending on the indication, clinical 
responses have  been less impressive (reported in 10- 45% of patients)  [Larkin, 2015b; Carbone, 
2017; Grywalska, 2018 ].  The most mature survival outcome results for checkpoint inhibitors are  
in advanced melanoma.  A pooled analysis of 12 clinical trials of ipilimumab in patients with 
advanced melanoma with follow -up to 10 years revealed a plateau at 21% in the survival curve 
beginning around year 3 [ Schadendorf, 2015] .  In a survival follow -up of patients who received 
nivolumab in advanced melanoma, the 60-month overall survival  rate was 34% with a plateau 
occurring at approximately (~ ) 48 months [ Hodi, 2016] . In a quest to improve on such results, PD -
1 inhibitors have been combined with other agents including checkpoint inhibitors, costimulatory 
agents, vaccines, chemotherapeutic agen ts, targeted therapies and radiation.  Along these lines, the 
first checkpoint -checkpoint combination of ipilimumab (CTLA -4 inhibitor ) and nivolumab (PD -1 
inhibitor ) was approved for late -stage melanoma based on a significant improvement in 
progression free survival compared to ipilimumab [ Larkin, 2015a ].   
Despite promising preclinical re sults of anti -tumor activity with OX40 agonists, early clinical trials 
of these agents as monotherapy ha ve been underwhelming.  Combination immunotherapy trials 
with PD -1 inhibitors and anti-OX40 antibodies are ongoing but results are pending. However, the 
data from the preclinical studies for this combination has been conflicting.  In vivo experiments in 
mice have demonstrated that simultaneous addition of anti –PD-1 to anti -OX40 antibodies negates  
the antitumor effects of the anti -OX40  antibody [Messenheimer, 2017; Shrimali, 2017] . In 
contrast, sequential combination of anti- OX40 antibody followed by anti -PD-1 antibody (but not 
the reverse order) resulted in significant increases in therapeutic efficacy [ Messenheimer, 2017] . 
These results suggest that in some cases the sequencing of agents must be carefully considered due 
to competition for Fc receptor binding [ Gao, 2017] . The synchronized blockade of immune 
suppression and costimulation of T cells is more difficult to achieve if separate antibodies are administered, as opposed to a single agent designed to engage both targets simultaneously [SL2018IB001_01] . This hurdle could be overcome by an immunotherapeutic such as SL -279252. 
The ECDs of PD-1 and OX40L are  physically linked to one another and localized to the TME.  
Tumor infiltrating T cells will receive costimulation at the same time that they recognize a tumor 
antigen via the T cell receptor.  
This first  in human, Phase 1 trial will assess the safety, tolerability , PK, pharmacodynamics  and 
anti-tumor activity of SL -279252 in patients with t umor types that have been documented to 
respond to anti -PD1/L1 therapy . All patients enrolled in this trial are required to have received or 
been intolerant to standard of care therapies . The m ajority of subjects  will also have received 
PD1/L1 and/or CTLA-4 inhibitors and progressed.

 is opened for enrollment, then enrollment on Schedule 1 will be halted. If Schedule 2 is opened, 
the Sponsor may also elect to stop enrollment in Schedule 2 early (e.g., based on safety) and resume 
enrollment in Schedule 1.  T he MTD or MAD may be determined for either Schedule 1 or 
Schedule 2. Alternatively, a less intensive dosing schedule may be instituted if safety and 
pharmacodynamic data on Schedule 1 support less frequent dosing of SL-279252.  
Pharmacodynamic Cohorts in Dose Escalation : The Sponsor, in consultation with the  SMC, 
may elect to open a pharmacodynamic cohort  in order to obtain additional pharmacodynamic data  
from  a total of approximately 6 additional subjects  at one or more dose level s that have previously 
completed evaluation for safety and has not exceeded the MTD . Subjects  enrolled in the 
pharmacodynamic cohort wil l not inform dose escalation decisions but the pharmacodynamic 
information gathered from these additional subjects may  inform selection of doses for further 
evaluation in dose expansion. As a result, the maximum planned sample size estimate in dose 
escalation may increase by approximately 6 subjects  and the overall total planned sample size 
estimates would increase accordingly. Subjects in the pharmacodynamic cohort will be followed 
per the Dose Escalation  Schedule of Assessment (SOA)  tables provided in Sections 6.1 (schedule 
1) and  6.2 (schedule 2) . 
Based on accumulating  data from the dose escalation phase, including safety, PK, 
pharmacodynamic and anti -tumo r activity,  up to two Dose E xpansion cohorts may  be opened. 
NOTE:  Only one schedule will be evaluated in the expansion phase. The primary objective of the 
expansion phase is to further refine the safety and tolerability  of SL -279252. T he expansion 
cohorts will also provide additional pharmacodynamic data and a preliminary estimate of anti -
tumor activity. At t he end of dose escalation  and dose expansion, safety, PK,  anti-tumor activity , 
and pharmacodynamic data will be reviewed to identify a RP2D (S ection  3.3.2).   
3.1.1 Sample S ize 
If only Schedule 1 is evaluated, the maximum planned sample size is 42 for dose escalation. If 
Schedule 1 and 2 are both fully evaluated in dose escalation, the maximum planned sample size is 
57. If pharmacodynamic cohorts are opened in dose escalation, the maximum sample size is 48 if 
schedule 1 is fully evaluated or 63 if Schedule 1 and 2 are fully evaluated. The sample size in each 
Expansion C ohort is ~15 subjects  (see Section 3.3 for details).  Overall, the total sample size 
estimate for this study is ~ 78 subjects assuming only S chedule 1 is evaluated  and 
pharmacodynamic cohorts are opened  and ~ 93 subjects if both Sc hedule 1 and 2 are fully evaluated  
and pharmacodynamic cohorts are opened. See Sections 9.2.1 and 9.2.2 for more details .

 3.1.2 Study Schema  
 
Safety evaluation of SL -279252 will begin on S chedule 1. Dose escalation will proceed as described in Section 3.2.4  
and Table 5. Initially, cohort size may be limited to 1 subject for enrollment until ≥ Grade 2 toxicity or DLT (see 
Section  3.2.5 for criteria to expand single subject cohort size and  Section 3.2.6  for DLT definition s) is observe d or 
DL 6 is reached; any of these scenario s trigger enrollment of ≥ 3 subjects in dose cohorts from that point forward.  
Enro llment into a DL will proceed based on the Keyboard Design outlined in the Appendix Section 16.3.  Schedule 2 
will be tested if investigation of a more frequent dosing schedule is considered necessary (Section 3.2.7 ). The starting 
dose on Schedule 2 will be at least 1 DL below the current  safe Schedule 1 DL  defined by the Keyboard design  
(denoted as DL  X-1 in the schema above) . An MTD or MAD may be identified on either Schedule  1 or S chedule 2. 
Up to 2 doses may be selected for further evaluation in dose expansion cohorts  and up to 15 subjects may enroll per 
cohort.  Only dose level s that ha ve been cleared for safety  (permitted to escalate per the Keyboard Design r ules) with 
a minimum of 6 subjects  treated at that dose level  will be expanded. The Dose Expansion cohorts  may be open ed to 
enroll subjects  in parallel with  the Dose Escalation cohort s.    Fresh tumor biopsies (obtained prior to C1D1, during 
C1D16 to C1D23, and at progression) are requested of subjects  in Dose Escalation  or Expansion coh orts who have 
tumor accessible to biopsy.  In addition, b lood will be obtained for serial assessment of PK and relevant  biomarkers  
during dose escalation and dose expansion. A pharmacodynamic cohort may also be explored during dose escalation 
as described in Section  3.1.  A RP2D  will be selected for further evaluation  at the end of the study based on the totality 
of the data .

3.2 Dose Escalation 
3.2.1 Description  
Dose escalation will proceed as described below .  Enrol lment will be based on the Keyboard 
Design outlined in the Appendix Section  16.3 [ Yan, 2017] .  During dose escalation, two possible 

CONFIDENTIAL    SL01 -DEL -101 
Compound: SL-279252  Version no: 07  
50 
 schedules for administration of SL -279252 may be explored. The first schedule (Schedule 1) will 
determine the s afety of administering SL -279252 on days 1, 8 and 15 of the first 28 -day cycle and 
then every 2 weeks thereafter on days 1 and 15 of each  28-day cycle beginning with cycle 2. The 
second schedule (Schedule 2) will explore the safety of weekly dosing of SL -279252 on days 1, 8, 
15 and 22 of each 28-day cycle.  T he DLT assessment period will end 7 days  after the last dose 
administered in the first cycle. Therefore, DLT s will be assessed over 21 days for Schedule 1 and 
over 28 days for Schedule 2. D LTs are defined in S ection  3.2.6.  
Enrollment on S chedule 2 may be instituted if safety and pharmacodynamic data support 
exploration of more frequent dosing based on defined inadequate evidence of pharmacodynamic 
activity on S chedule 1 (see S ection 3.2.7).  The starting dose on S chedule 2 will be at least 1 DL 
below the current safe Schedule 1 DL defined by the Keyboard design. Doses beyond the 
maximum dose stated in the protocol may be explored if the MTD has not been reached. In 
summary, an MTD or MAD may be determined on S chedule 1 or S chedule 2 depending on how 
the study evolves . Alternatively, a less intensive dosing schedule may be instituted  if safety and 
pharmacodynamic data on Schedule 1 support less frequent dosing of SL -279252 (e.g., one dose 
given every two weeks or every  three weeks  or every four weeks ).   
Blood will be collected prior to , during, and following SL -279252 administration for serial 
assessment of PK  (Section 6.7.1) and relevant biomarkers (e.g., cytokines, complement, receptor 
occupancy, etc.)  during dose escalation ( Section 6.9.1). T umor tiss ue (archival tissue and fresh 
tumor biopsies predose, on-treatment and at progression) will be requested of subjects as described 
in Section  6.9.2.  
3.2.2 Intrasubject D ose Escalation  
For subjects enrolled in D ose Escalation cohorts , intra-subject dose escalations may be considered 
on a case -by-case basis, provided that the subject completed at least 2 cycles at the originally 
assigned dose, has tolerated treatment well, and did not experience Grade 3 or higher toxicity. A 
subject’s dose may be increased to that of the current DL that has been evaluated for safety and 
has not exceeded the MTD . Approval  for intra -subject dose escalation  must be obtained from the 
Sponsor Medical Monitor.  Dose -escalation decisions will be documented on a Dose 
Escalation/De -escalation Decision Form ( see the Study Reference Manual; SR M). 
3.2.3 Justification for Starting Dose  
The starting dose of 0.0001 mg/kg SL -279252 for this first  in human study was derived using 
available nonclinical pharmacology, toxicology, PK and pharmacodynamic data from NHP studies in the cynomolgus species. The starting dose was selected  based on MABEL principles. 
In cynomolgus monkeys administered IV doses of 0.03 and 0.3 mg/kg over 30 minutes  (n=2 for 
each DL) resulted in median Cmax values of 564 and 7464 nanogram ( ng)/mL, respectively, which 
are approximately 738- and 56- fold below the Cmax observed in monkeys for the HNSTD dose 
of 10 mg/kg (416,000 ng/mL).  Assuming linear kinetics from the 0.03 mg/kg dose in cynomolgus 
monkeys (Cmax 564 ng/mL and AUC
0-infinity [ inf]  304 ng*h/mL), a 0.0001 mg/kg dose of SL -
279252 would achieve an estimated Cmax of 1.88 and AUC 0-inf of 1.01 ng*h/mL which is 
CONFIDENTIAL    SL01 -DEL -101 
Compound: SL-279252  Version no: 07  
51 
 approximately 200,000- and 700,000- fold lower than the Cmax and AUC 0-inf observed for the 
HNSTD dose of 10 mg/kg (Cmax 416,000 ng/m L; AUC 0-inf  726,000 ng*h/mL). 
However, because non- linear kinetics were observed for SL -279252 following single dose IV 
infusion in cynomolgus monkeys, a PK model was developed to capture the PK in monkeys 
adequately and to facilitate human exposure predictions. The PK  model for serum SL -279252 
concentrations following a single dose was developed using a two- compartment model with 
Michaelis -Menten clearance and allometric scaling by body weight on clearance and volume 
parameters. After accounting for body weight, there were no other important covariates in the 
model. The model tended to over -predict Cmax for the lowest doses (0.03 and 0.3 mg/kg) in 
monkeys by 1.2- to 2.1- fold, thus, the model was deemed a conservative model for simulating 
human exposure.  
Simulated human serum SL -279252 concentrations suggest that a starting dose of 0.0001 mg/kg 
results in median (95% confidence interval [ CI]) Cmax of 3.73 (2.83, 4.92) ng/mL and is 111,500-
fold lower than the median Cmax following administration of the HNSTD  dose (416,000 ng/mL). 
Simulated concentrations for the 0.0001 mg/kg dose are almost 10-fold below the Staph ylococcal 
Enterotoxin B ( SEB) Activity Assay half maximal effective concentration ( EC50 ; geometric mean 
and 95%  CI of 34.0 [21.3 – 54.4] ng/mL) MABEL. While simulations of a 0.0001 mg/kg dose 
result in concentrations that are comparable to the SEB Assay EC20 (5.3 [2.69, 10.4] ng/mL), the 
SEB Assay is known to be a sensitive assay and given the in vivo data, it is likely a single dose of 
0.0001 mg/kg will result in minimal to no biologic activity. Simulation of SL -279252 
concentrations following multiple doses were not possible with the available data.  
Justification for Schedule:  A weekly dosing schedule for 5 consecutive weeks was implemented 
in the NHP studies.  Toxicity was dose -dependent (only at the higher doses) and occurred at the 
third and subsequent doses.  In the clinical trial, the initial dosing schedule (Schedule 1) 
incorporates  administr ation of SL -279252 on Day 1, 8, 15, and then every 2 weeks  thereafter . The 
Day 8 dose was retained as no toxicity was observed at this time point , minimal pharmacodynamic 
effects were noted,  and this dose may have contribut ed to the pharmacodynamic effect on day 15. 
In NHP s, multiple factors may have contributed to the onset of reactions at Day 15 including ADA, 
complement activation, increase in lymphocytes  and cytokine elevations .  It is unknown if these 
contributing factors would be observed in humans at the doses studied.  Therefore, dosing on Day 
1, 8, 15 w as considered acceptable.  The 2 -week treatment free interval beyond Day 15 may allow 
for pharmacodynamic effects to subside between subsequent doses  and to mitigate toxicity . A less 
intensive dosing schedule may be instituted if safety and pharmacodynamic data on Schedule 1 support less frequent dosing of SL -279252 (e.g., one dose given every two weeks or every 3 weeks  
or every 4  weeks ).   
3.2.4 Starting Dose and Dose Escalation Plan   
Enrollment of subjects at each DL proceed s based on the Keyboard design outlined in the 
Appendix Section 16.3. Dose escalation will begin on S chedule 1 at the starting dose of 0.0001 
mg/kg as outlined in Table 5 below; intermediate DL s not shown may be explored based on 
emerging data (e.g., safety). As it  is likely that the dose of 0.0001 mg/kg will result in minimal to 
no biologic activity, escalations for the first two  DLs will proceed in log increments.  Beyond DL2, 
CONFIDENTIAL    SL01 -DEL -101 
Compound: SL-279252  Version no: 07  
52 
 escalations will not exceed half -log increments. Doses beyond the maximum dose stated in the 
protocol may be explored if the MTD has not been reached.  An MTD or MAD may be determined 
on Schedule 1 or Schedule 2 and up to 10 or more  dose levels may be explored if safety allows.  
Table 5: SL -279252 Dose Escalation Plan  
Dose Level  Dose of SL-279252 (mg/kg)a,b,c,d Duration of Infusione 
Level 1  0.0001 mg/kg  5-30 minutes  
Level 2  0.001 mg/kg  5-30 minutes  
Level 3  0.003 mg/kg  5-30 minutes  
Level 4 0.01 mg/kg  30 minutes (+/- 10 minutes)  
Level 5 0.03 mg/kg  30 minutes  (+/- 10 minutes)  
Level 6 0.1 mg/kg  30 minutes  (+/- 10 minutes)  
Level 7 0.3 mg/kg  30 minutes  (+/- 10 minutes)  
Level 8 1.0 mg/kg  1 hour (+/- 15 minutes)  
Level 9 3.0 mg/kg  1 hour  (+/- 15 minutes)  
Level 10 6.0 mg/kg  1 hour (+/- 15 minutes)  
a) Dose escalation begins on Schedule 1 : SL-279252 may be administered in the first cycle on days 1, 8, and 
15 of the first 28-day cycle and then once every 2 weeks on days 1 and 15 of ea ch 28-day cycle beginning at 
cycle 2 . 
b) Dose escalation  on Schedule 2 may be tested: If Schedule 2 is opened, SL -279252 may be administered 
once weekly on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of each 28-day cycle. The starting dose on schedule 2 will be at least 
one dose level below the current Schedule 1 dose level defined by the Keyboard design. If Schedule 2 is 
opened for enrollment, then enrollment on S chedule 1 will be halted.  
c) Intermediate dose levels may be tested based on emerging safety data. The option to explore more than 10  
dose levels on S chedule 1 or additional dose levels on Schedule 2 is also a possibility if safety allows.  
Escalations will not exceed half -log increments  after dose level 2. 
d) The actual body weight in kg will be used for dose calculation in all subjects whose body weight is ≤ 100 kg.  
For subjects with body weight >100 kg, the dose to be administered should be the same as that calculated for 
a subject weighing 100 kg (See Sectio ns 5.2.3  and 5.4 for details ) 
e) Infusion time may change based on final drug volume needed for administration, safety and tolerability of the infusion for the subject, and/or observed safety findings during the study. Please refer to the Study Pharmacy 
Manual ( SPM ) for details.  
Evaluat ion of Schedule 1: Initially, and as outlined in Section 16.3.1, cohort size in S chedule 1 
may be limited to 1 subject for enrollment until one of the following occurs: a ≥ Grade 2 toxicity 
or DLT is observed (see Section s 3.2.5 and  3.2.6 for definitions ) or DL 6 is reached; any of these 
scenario s will trigger enrollment of ≥ 3 subjects in dose level cohorts from that point forward. 
Multiple -subject cohorts will incorporate a  minimum 3 -day stagger between dosing the first and 
second subject at the same dose level , although this requirement may change based on emerging 
safety data as determined by the SMC . The incidence of DLT will be assessed over a period of 21 
days during the first cycle of therapy (DLTs are defined in Section 3.2.6) on Schedule 1.   
Evaluation of Schedule 2: If safety  and pharmacodynamic data from Schedule 1  (see Section  
3.2.7 for criteria needed to transition to Schedule 2) support exploration of more frequent dosing, 
then cohort enrollment on S chedule 2 will be instituted  in lieu of S chedule 1 . During dosing on 
Schedule 2, SL -279252 will be administered once weekly (D1, D8, D15, and D22) every 28 days.  
The starting dose on S chedule 2 will be at least 1 DL lower  than the current  safe Schedule 1 DL 
defined by the Keyboard design. Dose escalation  (or de -escalation)  may then proceed based on a 
CONFIDENTIAL    SL01 -DEL -101 
Compound: SL-279252  Version no: 07  
53 
 DL previously evaluated on S chedule 1  as shown in Table 5. For example, if 0.1 mg/kg ( DL 6) is 
the current DL  being evaluated  on S chedule 1 , then the starting dose on S chedule 2 will be  
0.03 mg/kg ( DL 5) or lower.   
A minimu m of 3 subjects will be evaluated in each DL during dose escalation on S chedule 2. A 
minimum 3-day stagger between dosing the first and s econd  subject at the same DL  is required , 
although this  mandate may change based on emerging safety data. The incidence of DLT  will be 
assessed over a period of 28 days during the first cycle of therapy (DLTs are defined in Section  
3.2.6) on S chedule 2 .  
Evaluation of  a Less Frequent Dosing Schedul e: If safety and pharmacodynamic data from 
Schedule 1 support exploration of a less intensive  dosing schedule , then cohort enrollment on this 
as yet to be identified schedule  will be instituted in lieu of Schedule 1. For example, SL -279252 
may be administered once every two weeks in  every cycle including the first cycle or once every 
21 or 28 days.  The  starting dose on this less intensive schedule would be instituted at the current 
Schedule 1 dose level defined by the Keyboard design or a lower dose level based on emerging  
safety data. 
3.2.5 Criteria for Expanding a Single Subject Cohort in Schedule 1  
Dose escalation on Schedule 1 allows enrollment of a single subject (minimum of one subject per 
DL) into dose levels 1 to  5 unless  a Grade ≥  2 toxicity or DLT  (Section 3.2.6) is observed over the 
21-day DLT assessment period with the exceptions  listed below.  A qualifying event of Grade ≥ 2 
toxicity or DLT will trigger a switch to enrollment of ≥  3 subjects for DLT assessment in that 
specific dose level and each DL thereafter .  
Toxicity exceptions that will not trigger a switch to enrollment of  ≥ 3 subjects: 
• Grade 2 fatigue 
• Grade 2 nausea and vomiting controllable with anti-emetics within 72 hours 
• Vitiligo and alopecia of any Grade 
• Grade 2 IRR that can be managed with premedication and/or change in infusion duration 
• Grade 2 hematologic abnormalities not associated with clinical signs/symptoms  
• Grade 2 electrolyte abnormalities that are not associated with clinical signs/symptoms  
• Grade 2 amylase and lipase without evidence of clinical symptoms of pancreatitis  
• Toxicities related to disease progression or intercurrent illness, inflammatory reactions 
related to local tumor response such as severe pain  
3.2.6 Definition of Dose -Limiting Toxicity  
DLT s are defined in the bulleted points below.  Toxicities will be graded as per NCI CTCAE v5.  
The determinate period for DLT is the first 21  days or 28 days of treatment  on S chedule 1 or 
Schedule 2, respectively. However, there is provision in the criteria below for toxicities that occur 
beyond this period to be considered in the definition of a DLT and the RP2D.  Note : Toxicities 
clearly relat ed to disease progression or intercurrent illness are not considered DLTs.  
Inflammatory reactions attributable to local anti- tumor responses (e .g., severe pain) are not 
considered DLTs.

• Any Grade 3 or greater non- irAE except  for those listed below: 
o Grade 3 fatigue lasting ≤ 7 days  
o Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia not associated with fever that imp roves to Grade 2 within 7 
days.   
o Grade 3 or 4 lymphopenia

 o Grade 3 or 4 amylase and/ or lipase abnormalities that are not associated with clinical 
signs/symptoms or finding on imaging consistent with pancreatitis 
o Grade 3  vomiting and/ or Grade 3 nausea that resolves within 72 hours with appropriate 
clinical management  
• Other toxicities may be considered a DLT as determined by the investigator in conjunction 
with the  SMC . 
A Grade ≥ 3 AE that occurs beyond the DLT period (21 days for schedule 1 or 28 days for schedule 
2) or Grade 2 events that require continuous interruption of  SL-279252 for more than 6 weeks  or 
toxicities that result in subjects not receiv ing at least 66% of the scheduled dose during the DLT 
assessment period may be taken into consideration  when assessing the totality of the data in 
determining evaluability for DLT and the  RP2D.   
3.2.7 Criteria for Decision to Transition from S chedule 1 to S chedule 2  
If Schedule 1 is safe and tolerable, and pharmacodynamic effects are not present or detectable, this 
may suggest that a more frequent dosing schedule is warranted. In this event an alternative dosing 
schedule ( Schedule 2) will be explored in lieu of S chedule 1.  During dose escalation subjects will 
be monitored for pharmacodynamic effects pre- and post -dose. Dynamic changes that are 
anticipated following administration of pharmacologically active doses of SL-279252 include: 
• Evidence of increasing target density on PBMCs following repeated dosing  
• Increase in lym phocyte count 
• Increase in cytokines  
• Appearance of activation markers (e.g., Human Leukocyte Antigen D Related, CD25, etc.) 
on the surface of CD4 lymphocytes in the peripheral blood 
The anticipated timing of pharmacodynamic effects based on NHP studies is at cycle 1, day 15 
(C1D15) and beyond, although these effects may be observed as early as C1D1 and C1D8.    
3.3 Dose E xpansion  
3.3.1 Description  
Based on accumulating data from the dose escalation phase, including safety, PK, 
pharmacodynamic and anti-tumor activity, up to two D ose Expansion Cohorts may be opened for 
enrollment. The primary objective for  the Dose Expansion C ohorts is  to further refine the safety 
and tolerability  of SL -279252. Safety will be carefully monitored, and s equential boundaries will 
be used to monitor  for IRRs  and discontinuation  of SL -279252 due to toxicity based on Pocock 
stopping rules  [Ivanova, 2005]  as outlined in Section  9.2.2. The expansion cohorts could 
potentially begin enrollment prior to the end of dose escalation . Only dose levels that have been 
cleared for safety (permitted to escalate per the Keyboard Desig n rules) with a minimum of 6 
subjects treated at that dose level will be expanded. Up  to 15 subjects  will be evaluated in each 
CONFIDENTIAL    SL01 -DEL -101 
Compound: SL-279252  Version no: 07  
56 
 Expansion C ohort at a selected dose. One or two doses of SL -279252 (on the same schedule, i.e., 
only one schedule will be evaluated in the expansion phase) may be expanded.   
Secondary objectives for the dose expansion cohorts include a preliminary estimate of anti-tumor 
activity  as measured by ORR and CBR. In addition, exploratory pharmacodynamic objectives will 
be further examined in the Dose Expansion Cohorts. Blood will be collected prior to and following 
SL-279252 administration for assessment of PK  (sparse sampling; Section 6.7.2) and relevant 
biomarkers (e.g., cytokines, complement, immu nophenotyping, etc.) during dose expansion 
(Section 6.9.1). Tumor tissue (archival tissue and fresh tumor biopsies predose,  on- treatment and 
at progression) will be requested of subjects  in Expansion Cohorts as described in Section 6.9.2. 
Cell-free or circulating -free tumor nucleic acid  (cfNA ; see Section 6.9.1.4) and archival tumor 
tissue  (Section 6.9.2.2) will be obtained for retrospective assessment of tumor mutational burden 
(TMB ).   
3.3.2 Selection of Recommended Phase 2 Dose and Schedule for SL -279252  
If an MTD is not observed, the MAD would then be the highest dose administered as specified in 
the protocol. Selection of the dose and schedule for further study will therefore be  based upon 
safety, tolerability,  PK, anti-tumor activity, and pharmacodynamic markers  consistent with the 
mechanism of  action  of SL -279252. Exploratory PK/pharmacodynamic modeling will be 
performed.  Based on the totality of the data, from the Dose Escalation and Dose Expansion 
Cohorts, a RP2D will be selected.    
3.4 Concomitant Medications, Treatments, and Procedures  
Investigators may prescribe concomitant m edications or treatments deemed necessary to provide 
supportive care except for prohibited medication s (see Section  3.4.2).  Best supportive care  should 
be provide d when necessary for all subjects  (including antibiotics, bisphosphonates, r eceptor 
activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand  (RANKL) inhibitors, nutritional support, correction of 
metabolic disorders, optimal sympto m control, and pain management including palliative 
radiotherapy) after consul tation with the Sponsor Medical Monitor. 
Use of inhaled, topical, intranasal corticosteroids or local steroid injections (e.g., intra-articular 
injection) is permitted.  Temporary use of corticosteroids (e.g., prior to computed tomography [ CT] 
to prevent  contrast allergies) is acceptable after consultation with the Sponsor M edical 
Monitor. Use of immunosuppressive medication for the management of SL -279252- related AEs  
(e.g., prophylaxis in subjects who experience IRRs /CRS, treatment of immune -related toxicities) 
is permitted.  
3.4.1 Tumor Lysis Syndrome Prevention and Treatment Recommendations  
Hematologic malignancies are associated with a higher risk of tumor lysis syndrome ( TLS). 
Although TLS has been reported with solid tumors, its occurrence is rare.  The incidence of TLS with immune checkpoint inhibitors and costimulatory molecules is not well characterized.  TLS was recently reported in a subject with bladder cancer followin g treatment with atezolizumab 
[Brunnhoelzl, 2017] . Guidance for identifying subjects at risk and for management of TLS is 
provided below.  
CONFIDENTIAL    SL01 -DEL -101 
Compound: SL-279252  Version no: 07  
57 
 • The risk factors for devel oping acute TLS after initiation of chemotherapy include uric acid 
level (>8 mg/ deciliter [dL] or 25% increase from baseline), high tumor burden, high lactate 
dehydrogenase (i.e., LDH ≥2 x ULN ), hypercalcemia, elevated creatinine (>1.6 mg/dL), 
leukocytosis (>50x109/liter [ L]), and rapidly proliferating drug sensitive neoplasms 
[Rampello, 2006; Tufan, 2006] .   
       
• All subjects with elevated uric acid (>8  mg/dL, or >476 millimo le [mmol] /L) should 
receive prophylaxis with allopurinol or rasburicase, and hydrat ion per standard of care. 
Blood chemistries should be monitored as indicated. If the constellation of clinical and/or 
laboratory signs indicate a possibility of developing TLS, subjects should be hospitalized with frequent monitoring of clinical signs and clinical chemistries and treated accordingly.  IV hydr ation should be continued, as needed, in subsequent cycles and subjects should be 
monitored for fluid overload during this period.   
 
Treatment of TLS should be instituted when appropriate according to institutional guidelines. 
3.4.2 Prohibited Medications/Treatments  
Subjects must be instructed not to take any medications, including over -the- counter products 
without first consulting with the investigator.   The following medications are prohibited during the 
study: 
• Any investigational anti -cancer  therapy not described in this protocol 
• Any concurrent chemotherapy, radiotherapy (except palliative radiotherapy after 
consultation with the Sponsor M edical Monitor), hormonal therapy for anti -cancer intent, 
immunotherapy, or biologic therapy for cancer treatment   
• Concurr ent granulocyte colony stimulating factor ( G-CSF) or granulocyte-macrophage 
colony stimulating factor ( GM-CSF)  
• Immunosuppressive medications for primary prophylaxis against IRRs are not permitted . 
Subjects who require immunosuppressive medications (e.g., corticosteroids) for 
management of irAE s or IRRs/CRS should be managed per Toxicity Management 
Guidelines in Section  3.5. 
• Live attenuated vaccines during the study through 30 days after the last dose of SL -279252 
 
3.4.3 Medications to be used with Caution 
SL-279252 is a therapeutic protein  that may induce the transient  release of cytokines including IL -
6 which in turn, may inhibit the activity of  cytochrome P450 ( CYP450) enzymes including 
CYP3A4 activity [ Evers, 2013] .  Although not tested clinic ally, a drug -drug interaction may occur 
with the coadministration of medications that  are CYP 450 substrates . Drugs metabolized by 
CYP 450 enzymes  may have reduced clearance or an increase in half-life or peak plasma 
concentration and should be used with caution. There may be an increased risk of side effects for 
drugs that are CYP 450 substrates . Where possible consider substitutions for these medicinal 
products if therapeutic effects cannot be monitored.

 A complete list of drugs that are CYP450 substrates including CYP3A4 substrates is available at: 
https://drug -interactions.medicine. iu.edu/Main-Table.aspx (Flockhart Table).  
3.5 Toxicity Management Guidelines  
All AEs should be assessed using NCI -CTCAE  v5.0 criteria. NOTE:  Hereafter in this Section , 
SL-279252 may be referred to as SL -279252 or as IP. Please see sections  5.5 Physician 
Availability Required for Administration of SL -279252 and 5.6 Monitoring Dose Administration. 
NOTE : Dose reductions of SL -279252 are not permitted except in the event of rechallenge after 
Grade 3 CRS  as noted in the guideline below.  
3.5.1 Management of Infusion- related Reactions  
The data from the NHP studies indicate a potential risk for IRRs including CRS in humans  dosed 
with SL -279252. The IRRs that were noted in cynomolgus monkeys  were potentially  cytokine-
mediated as they a) dem onstrated dose dependence and b)  the severity of clinical symptoms  
correlated with cytokine level increases  in the peripheral blood. It is important to note that the 
reactions that were noted in monkeys occurred during or immediately after SL -279252 infusion. 
Given the mechanism of action of SL -279252 (T cells become activa ted as th ey recognize tumor  
antigen), rapid onset of IRRs would be expected  but the possibility of delayed reactions cannot be 
excluded . It is unlikely that SL -279252 infusion reactions are antibody- mediated type I or type 3, 
allergic HSRs  as these reactions  would not be expected to demonstrate dose dependence.  
Differentiat ing between  IRRs  that are due to either  the common non- allergic HSR s (e.g., CRS ) or 
the rarer allergic HSR s can be challenging due to overlapping clinical manifestations . There are 
no specific clinical features (including symptoms and timing of reaction) that can absolutely 
distinguish between these two entities.  
General guidance is provided below for  IRRs  secondary to both allergic and non- allergic HSRs 
e.g., CRS. These  guidelines are not meant to be prescriptive. Established institutional guidelines 
should be followed where appropriate.  
At the resolution of the event, the entirety of the data including clinical symptoms, response to 
treatment and laboratory studies should be re -evaluated to determine the final etiology of the event. 
For purposes of standardized reporting, utilize terms based on best medical judgement of the 
AE/SAE  and the definition found in NCI -CTCAE v5.0 for IRR, allergic reaction, anaphylaxis, and 
CRS.  
Primary prophylaxis against IRRs is not permitted to avoid obscuring a potential safety signal and 
to enable an assessment of whether pre -medications should be required for all subjects.  However, 
as noted in the guidance below, secondary prophylaxis (i.e., prevention of IRRs following an initial 
episode) is appropriate and permitted at the discretion of the investigator.  
NOTE:  In the event of a ny Grade IRR (including CRS), subjects will be admitted for closer 
observation until resolution of symptoms.

Infusion or 
Hypersensitivity 
Reactions  
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
  
 
 
 Acute reactions to the IV administration of biologic agents is not uncommon. Reactions are either allergic reactions to forei gn proteins 
or non- immune reactions. The term HSR is used to describe objectively reproducible signs or symptoms initiated by exposure to a 
defined stimulus at dose tolerated by a normal person. Allergy is HSR initiated by specific immunological mechanisms.  Anaphy laxis is 
a severe, life threatening HSR.  CRS consists of a non- allergic, cytokine mediated HSR.  Differentiation between the common non-
allergic HRS reactions and the rarer allergic HSR reactions can be challenging due to overlapping clinical manifestations. Fever, chills, 
rigors, headache, arthralgias, back pain, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dyspnea, flushing, pruritus, and changes in heart 
rate and blood pressure are manifestations of common acute infusion reactions. Proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF -α and IL -6 
may play a role in these reactions. Symptoms more suggestive of allergic HSR include generalized pruritus, urticaria, wheezing, 
frequent coughing, and anaphylactic symptoms. Subjects must be monitored for signs and symptoms of IRRs with prompt institution of 
treatment.   
Severity  Management  
Grade 1  • Infusion interruption not indicated  
• Admit to hospital for close observation until resolution of symptoms.  
• Consider pre-medication (antipyretics, histamine (H)1 and H2 anti -histamines) for subsequent infusions per 
investigator/institutional guidelines  
Grade 2  • Temporarily interrupt IP, or decrease the rate of the infusion by 50%, until resolution of the event.  
• Begin IV infusion of normal saline and treat with antipyretics, histamine 1 and 2 (H1 and H2) anti-histamines.  Corticosteroids and/or bronchodilator therapy may also be administered as appropriate. Monitor subject until resolution of symptoms.  
• If the infusion is interrupted, then restart the infusion at no more than 50% of the rate at which the reaction 
symptoms occurred  
• If no further symptoms are experienced, infusion rate may be escalated at intervals and increments as 
clinically appropriate  
• If symptoms recur, then no further investigational product (IP) will be administered at this visit.  
• Admit to hospital for close observation until resolution of symptoms.  
• The following prophylactic pre- medications are recommended for future infusions: antipyretics, anti -
histamines with/without corticosteroids per institutional guidelines  
Grade 3  • Immediately discontinue infusion.   
• Begin IV infusion of normal saline and treat with epinephrine, bronchodilators, diphenhydramine, ranitidine, corticosteroids, oxygen, fluids, vasopressors etc.as indicate and per institutional guidelines. Epinephrine is 
the drug of choice in an anaphylactic reaction and its administration should not be delayed.  
• Admit to hospital for close observation until resolution of symptoms.  
• Rechallenge should not be attempted in cases of true anaphylaxis. In other cases, once subject has completely recovered, carefully consider if it is safe for the subject to receive IP at the next scheduled dose 
with pre- medication (e.g., corticosteroids, anti -histamines, antipyretics) and slow infusion (≤ 50% of the rate 
at which the reaction occurred). If no further symptoms, rate may be escalated at intervals and increments 
as clinically appropriate. If symptoms recur, permanently discontinue IP  
Grade 4  • Permanently discontinue IP  
• Manage severe IRRs per institutional standards (e.g., epinephrine, diphenhydramine, ranitidine, corticosteroids, bronchodilators, oxygen, fluids etc.).  Epinephrine is the drug of choice in an anaphylactic reaction and it s administration should not be delayed  
• Admit to hospital for close observation until resolution of symptoms.

 Cytokine -release  
  
 
  
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
  
 
 
 CRS is a non -antigen specific, systemic inflammatory response that occurs as result of high -level immune activation with concomitant 
elevations of cytokines (e.g., IL-6, IL -10, TNF -α, IL -2, IFN ɣ). Clinical features of the syndrome include (but are not conf ined to) fever, 
flu-like symptoms, rash, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, hypotension, tachypnea, transaminitis, hypofibrinogenemia, elevation in D -dimer, 
hyperbilirubinemia, azotemia, neurologic manifestations.  The syndrome can progress to life-threatening capillary leak, hypoxic 
respiratory failure, vasodilatory shock and end- organ dysfunction. NOTE:  CRS may have a similar presentation to a type 1 HSR and 
may be clinically indistinguishable.  
Severity 
(symptoms)  Management  of CRS  
Grade 1  
 • Decrease the rate of the infusion by 50%, until resolution of the event  
• Maintain IV access. Symptomatic treatment with antipyretics, antiemetics, analgesics, H1/H2 antihistamines as needed; monitor fluid balance; assess for infection. Regularly evaluate for signs of further deterioration  
• Admit to hospital for close observation until resolution of symptoms.  
• For subsequent infusions, consider pre- medication (e.g., antipyretics, anti -histamines) per institutional 
guidelines  
Grade 2  
 • Interrupt IP  and do not -restart  until symptoms are  returned to grade ≤1 for at least 3 days . Once symptoms 
have resolved, administer dose per next scheduled time  point . 
• Start IV infusion with normal saline. Administer oxygen if needed. Treat with antipyretics, H1/H2 antagonists 
(diphenhydramine 50 mg IV plus ranitidine 50 mg IV), and/or methylprednisolone 1-2 mg/kg or equivalent dose of corticosteroid every 6 hours and manage per institutional guideli nes. Closely monitor cardiac and 
other organ functions.  
• Admit to hospital for close observation until resolution of symptoms.  
• The next two subsequent infusions of SL- 279252 (after an event of grade 2 CRS)  must  be administered in an 
inpatient setting for prolonged observation  (e.g., 24 hours ). 
• For subsequent infusions, start infusion at 50% rate at which the symptoms occurred and titrate to tolerance. Consider pre -medication  with dexamethasone 20 mg, antipyretics, H1/H2 anti -histamines, and manage per 
institutional guidelines.  
• Subjects with exte nsive comorbidities or those of older age should be treated as for Grade 3.  Subjects with 
worsening symptoms should be treated as for Grade 3  
Grade 3  • Interrupt IP and do not -restart until symptoms are  returned to grade ≤1 for at least 3 days . Once sympt oms 
have resolved, administer dose per next scheduled timepoint . 
• Admit to hospital for close observation until resolution of symptoms.  
• For Grade 3 CRS, may consider rechallenge at the next  lower dose level after consultation with medical 
monitor.   
• After a Grade 3 CRS event, subjects  must be premedicated with high dose steroids  prior to the next infusion 
of SL -279252.  
• If there is no evidence of CRS with the infusion at the reduced dose level, premedication with high dose 
steroids may be omitted for subsequent infusions.   
• The two subsequent infusions of SL-279252 after an event of grade 3 CRS should be administered in an 
inpatient setting for prolonged observation (e.g., 24 hours ). 
• Any patient that experiences recurrence of Grade 3 CRS following re -treatment must be permanently 
discontinued from study  treatment .

 3.5.2 Management of irAEs  
Adverse Event  General Guidance for Management of Immune -related Adverse Events (irAEs ) [Haanen, 2017; 
Puzanov, 2017 ; Brahmer, 2018 ] 
 
irAEs - General  
 
 Guidelines for management of irAEs across body systems are outlined in this section.  These guidelines are not meant to be 
prescriptive. Established institutional guidelines should be followed where appropriate. Severity of irAE are categorized according t o 
NCI CTCAEv5. Limitations of classification and grading by CTCAEv5 for specific irAEs may be encountered.  Based on the severi ty of 
the irAE, the IP may either be continued, held or permanently discontinued.  Management relies heavily on corticosteroids and other 
immunomodulatory agents.  Generally, the decision on IP and institution of immunosuppressive therapy (corticosteroid therapy)  can be 
approached as noted below.  However, treatment should be individualized depending on the subject’s medical history, the nature and 
severity of the AE, co- morbidities, and ability to tolerate corticosteroids.  When starting corticosteroid therapy, consider initiating proton 
pump inhibitors for gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity prophylaxis.  Once toxicity has improved to ≤  Grade 1 AE, start tapering corticosteroid 
therapy over a 4 to 6-week period. Add pneumocystis pneumonia prophylaxis (cotrimoxazole or inhaled pentamidine if cotrimoxazole 
allergy) if more than 3 weeks of immunosuppression expected (>30 mg prednisone or eq uivalent).  Consider calcium & vitamin D 
supplementation as per local guidelines.  
Severity  Management  
Grade 1  • IP is continued, and treatment with corticosteroids is usually not indicated  
Grade 2  
 • Depending on the nature of the AE, corticosteroids may be indicated.  
• Start with oral prednisone 0.5- 1 mg/kg/day. IP is generally held during corticosteroid therapy and until irAE has 
resolved to ≤ Grade 1 and corticosteroids have been tapered to ≤ prednis one 10 mg/day (or equivalent) or 
discontinued.  
• If IV therapy is required, use methylprednisolone 0.5 – 1 mg/kg/day.  If no improvement in symptoms, the dose 
may be increased to 2 mg/kg/day.   
Grade 3  • Hold IP.  
• Start prednisone 1-2 mg/kg/day (or equivalent dose of methylprednisolone).   
• If no improvement, consider adding alternative immune suppressant therapy.  
Grade 4  • Permanently discontinue IP and start IV methylprednisolone 1 -2 mg/kg/day.   
• If no improvement,  consider adding alternative immunosuppressant.  
Adverse Event  General Guidance for Skin Toxicity  
 
 
  
 
 
 
Skin Toxicity  
 
 Monitor for signs and symptoms of dermatitis (rash and pruritus). Exclude other causes (e.g., infection, drug, another system ic disease 
or unrelated primary skin disorder).  IP must be discontinued if there is any bullous formation (any grade), or if Severe Cutaneous 
Adverse Reactions (including Stevens -Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis, 
drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms) are present. Severity may be based on affected body surface ar ea (BSA), 
tolerability, morbidity, and duration.   
Severity 
(symptoms)  Management  
Grade 1  
(Skin rash <10% 
BSA, with or 
without symptoms)  • Continue IP.  
• Topical emollients and/or mild- moderate potency topical corticosteroids +/ - oral or topical antihistamines for 
pruritus. 
• Counsel subject to avoid skin irritants and sun exposure.

• Rule out alternative etiologies (e.g., infection, disease progression). Stool microscopy for leukocytes/ova/parasites, calprot ectin, 
lactoferrin, culture, viral polymerase chain reaction (PCR), Clostridium difficile toxin and cryptospordia.   
• Sigmoidoscopy/ colonoscopy (+/ - biopsy) is recommended in subjects with severe diarrhea (Grade 3 or 4) or persistent Grade 2 
diarrhea. Subjects with Grade 1 or 2 diarrhea with dehydration, fever, tachycardia or hematochezia would be managed as per Gr ade 
3 or 4. Steroids should be considered in the absence of clear alternative etiology, even for low grade events, to prevent potential 
progression to higher grade event.  
• Use analgesics carefully; they may mask symptoms of perforation and peritonitis. Use antidiarrheal agents  with caution (avoid in

Hepatotoxicity  
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 Monitor signs, symptoms  and laboratory evidence of liver dysfunction.  Evaluate alternative etiologies: review medications for 
hepatotoxic drugs and alcohol history; perform liver screen: hepatitis A, B, C serology, hepatitis E PCR, antinuclear antibody 
(ANA)/smooth muscle antibody/liver kidney microsomal antibodies /soluble liver antibody/liver -pancreas antigen/liver cytosol iatrogene 
antibodies, iron studies; consider imaging for metastases/thrombosis.  Guidelines are based on elevations in ALT, AST and bil irubin per 
CTCAEv5. Discontinue IP for Hy’s law as follows: in subjects who enroll with AST/ALT/total bilirubin≤ ULN who experience concomitant AST or ALT > 3 x ULN and total bilirubin > 2 x ULN; or in subjects who enroll with AST/ALT/total bilirubin > ULN who experience 
conco mitant AST or ALT > 3 x baseline and total bilirubin > 2 x baseline.  
Severity  Management  
Grade 1  • Continue IP with close monitoring.  
• Monitor liver function at least weekly; if liver function is stable, reduce frequency of blood tests.  
Grade 2  • Hold IP.  
• Assessments as above; monitor liver function ~every 3 days; liver biopsy is optional.  
• If persistent or rising liver chemistries, or significant clinical symptoms, start oral prednisone 0.5- 1 mg/kg/day 
(or equivalent of methylprednisolone) with 4-week taper.  
• Resume IP when toxicity ≤ G1 and corticosteroid taper to ≤ 10 mg/day prednisone or equivalent.

 Pulmonary 
Toxicity 
 
 
 General Guidance for Pulmonary Toxicity  
Monitor subjects for signs and symptoms of pneumonitis or interstitial lung disease (new onset or worsening shortness of brea th or 
cough). Initial work -up may include clinical evaluation, chest X -ray, pulse oximetry (resting and exertion), laboratory work -up, screen for 
viral, opportunistic or bacterial infections depending on the clinical context. High resolution computed tomography (CT) scan +/- 
bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL).  
Severity  Management  
Grade 1  • Consider holding IP as clinically appropriate and during diagnostic work -up.   
• Monitor every 2 – 3 days for clinical symptoms, pulse oximetry (resting and exertion) and laboratory work -up as 
clinically indicated.  
• Consider pulmonary and infectious disease consult.  
• May resume IP with radiographic evidence of improvement or resolution.  If no improvement, should treat as 
Grade 2.  
• Monitor patients weekly with history, physician examination, pulse oximetry, and chest X -ray if required.  
Grade 2  • Hold IP until resolution to baseline.  
• If Grade 2 toxicity improves to baseline, then consider re- challenge if symptoms and imaging abnormalities 
resolve and corticosteroids ≤10 mg/day prednisone or equivalent.  
• Monitor symptoms daily and consider hospitalization.   
• Institute work -up – high resolution CT +/ - bronchoscopy and BAL pending clinical status, repeat chest X -ray 
weekly and baseline bloods, pulmonary function tests (PFTs) including transfer factor for carbon monoxide. 
Obtain pulmonary and infectious  disease consult.  
• Start antibiotics if suspicion of infection (fever, C reactive protein (CRP), neutrophil counts).  
• If no evidence of infection or no improvement with antibiotics after 48 hours, add in oral prednisone 1 mg/kg/day.  
• If no improvement after  48 hours of oral prednisone, manage as per Grade 3 or 4.  
• Once improved to baseline, wean steroids over at least 6 weeks, titrate to symptoms.  
 
Grade 3 or 4  • Permanently discontinue IP.  
• Promptly initiate methylprednisolone 2 to 4 mg/kg/day or equivalent.  
• Hospitalize; provide supportive care (oxygen, etc.); obtain baseline tests as above including high resolution CT 
and respiratory review +/ - bronchoscopy and BAL pending appearances. Obtain pulmonary and infectious 
disease consult.  
• Initiate emp iric antibiotics.   
• If no improvement or worsening after 48 hours, add infliximab at 5 mg/kg, or MMF (if concurrent hepatotoxicity).  
• Continue with IV steroids and wean as clinically indicated.   
• Once improved to baseline, wean steroids over at least 8 wee ks.

 Adverse Event  General Guidance for Nephrotoxicity  
 Nephrotoxicity  Monitor serum creatinine and urea prior to every dose. Stop nephrotoxic drugs (including over the counter medications), rule out 
infection, urinary tract obstruction and correcting hypovolemia. Withhold IP in the event of significant renal dysfunction; consider the use 
of systemic corticosteroids therapy (0.5 –2 mg/kg methylprednisolone or equivalent) – dose and schedule should be individualized and 
based on grade. Taper corticosteroids when creatinine improves to Grade 1. In the event of severe renal dysfunction, a nephrologist should be consulted. Reflex renal biopsy should be discouraged until steroid treatment has been attempted. Toxicity grading i s based on 
increase in creatinine level as per CTCAEv5.  
Severity  Management  
Grade 1  • Initiate work -up and monitor closely.  
• Alternatively, consider temporarily holding IP, pending consideration of potential alternative etiologies and 
baseline renal function.  
Grade 2  • Hold IP; consider resuming when creatinine decreased to ≤ Grade 1 and steroids have been tapered.  
• Discontinue IP for persistent or recurrent elevation.  
• For persistent creatinine elevation with no other identifiable causes, start prednisone 0.5- 1 mg/kg/day  or 
equivalent.  
Grade 3  • Hold IP.  
• Start prednisone 1-2 mg/kg/day or equivalent.  
• Consider resuming treatment if Grade 3 resolves and cause of event is confirmed.  
• Discontinue IP permanently for persistent or recurrent elevation of serum creatinine and urea . 
Grade 4  • Permanently discontinue IP. Start methylprednisolone 1 -2 mg/kg/day or equivalent.  
Adverse Event  General Guidance for Endocrine Toxicity  
Endocrine 
Toxicity  • Monitor subject for signs and symptoms of endocrinopathies. Non -specific symptoms include headache, fatigue, behavior changes, 
changed mental status, vertigo, abdominal pain, unusual bowel habits, hypotension and weakness.  Severe mass effect symptoms 
(severe headache, any visual disturbances) or severe hypoadrenalism (hypotension, severe electrolyte disturbances) are observed 
with hypophysitis (observed with anti -CTLA4 therapy; very rare with PD -1/L1 inhibitor therapy. Perform magnetic resonance imaging 
(MRI) to visualize the pituitary gland and rule out any alternative etiology (e.g., disease progression including brain metastases, 
infection).   
• Consult endocrinologist.  
Evaluate thyroid function (thyroid stimulating hormone [TSH], free thyroxine [T]3, free T4) and other relevant endocrine labs  (e.g., 
blood glucose, cortisol, sex hormones) depending on suspected endocrinopathy.  Falling TSH across 2 measurements with normal or lowered T4 may also suggest pituitary dysfunction and weekly cortisol measurements (9 am cortisol) should be performed.  Iodine from CT scans may impact thyroid function tests (TFTs).  If a subject has an AE that is thought to be possibly of autoimmune nature (e.g., thyroiditis, pancreatitis, hypophysitis, diabetes insipidus), the investigator should send a blood sample for appropri ate 
autoimmune antibody testing (e.g., anti -thyroid antibodies for thyroid dysfunction, C -peptide and antibodies against glutamic acid 
decarboxylase and islet cell antibodies should be measured to distinguish between type 1 and 2 diabetes mellitus [DM]).

 Adverse Event  General Guidance for Ocular Toxicity  
 Ocular Toxicity  Counsel all subjects to inform their healthcare provider immediately if they experience ocular symptoms. Evaluate under guida nce of 
ophthalmology. Ocular irAEs are many times seen in the context of other organ irAEs. High level of clinical suspicion as sym ptoms may 
not always be associated with severity. Treatment depends on severity, with topical corticosteroids in the case of episcleritis and 
anterior uveitis, and systemic corticosteroids in the case of severe ocular inflammation and orbital inflammation.   Intravitreal anti -
vascular endothelial growth is indicated for choroidal neovascularization.  Unlike anterior uveitis, posterior uveitis can be asymptomatic 
but nonetheless, proceed to visual loss.    
Severity (symptoms)

 Adverse Event  General Guidance for Cardiotoxicity  
 Cardiotoxicity  
 
 Early consultation with a cardiologist is recommended. Obtain baseline electrocardiogram (ECG).  All grades warrant work -up: ECG, 
creatine kinase (CK), creatine kinase – muscle/brain (CK -MB), troponin, brain natriuretic peptide, echocardiogram  (ECHO ), chest X -ray; 
additional testing as guided by cardiologist. High dose corticosteroids should be instituted rapidly if immune-mediated cardiotoxicity is 
suspected.  Escalation to other immunosuppressive drugs, such as infliximab, MMF, antithymocyte globulin (ATG) may be necessary if 
symp toms do not promptly respond to steroids.  
Severity  Management  
Grade 1  • Hold IP

 Myasthenia 
Gravis  
 
 
 Neurological consultation. All grades warrant work up and intervention given potential for progressive myasthenia gravis to l ead to 
respiratory compromise. Check acetylcholine receptor (AchR) and anti -striated muscle antibodies in blood.  If AchR antibodie s are 
negative, consider muscle specific kinase and lipoprotein-related 4 antibodies in blood. Monitor PFTs with negative inspiratory force 
and vital capacity (NIF/VC).  Consider magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain to rule out central nervous system (CN S) involvement 
by malignancy or alternate diagnosis. Check creatine phosphokinase, aldolase, ESR, CRP for possible concurrent myositis.  Rule out 
concomitant myocarditis.    
Severity  Management  
Grade 1  • Continue IP  
• Consider permanent discontinuation if AE worsens or does not improve.  
Grade 2  • Hold IP;  
• Discontinue permanently if AE worsens or does not improve; may resume only if symptoms resolve.

plasmapheresis x 5 days.  
 Guillain -Barre 
Syndrome  
 General Guidance for Guillain -Barre Syndrome (GBS)  
Neurological consultation. All grades warrant work up and intervention given potential to lead to respiratory compromise. Obt ain MRI 
spine w/wo contrast to rule out compressive lesion; perform lumbar puncture for CSF analysis; check serum antibody tests for GBS 
variants (GQ1b for Miller Fisher variant); PFTs (NIF/VC), and electrodiagnostic studies to evaluate polyneuropathy.  
Severity  Management  
Grade 1  • Continue IP; Consider permanent discontinuation of IP if AE worsens or does not improve  
Grade 2 or higher  • Discontinue IP.  
• Admit to inpatient unit with capability for rapid transfer to ICU -level monitoring. Frequent neuro review and 
pulmonary function assessment.  
• Non-opioid management of neuropathic pain.  
• Start IVIG (0.4 gm/kg/day x 5 days for a total dose of 2 gm/kg) or plasmapheresis.  Corticosteroids are usually not recommended for idiopathic GBS, however, in immunotherapy -related forms, a trial is 
reasonable (methylprednisolone 2 – 4 mg/kg/day followed by slow taper).  
• Pulse steroid dosing may also be considered along with  IVIG or plasmapheresis.

 Adverse Event  General Guidance for Hematologic Toxicity  
 Autoimmune 
Hemolytic Anemia  
 Although rare, hematologic irAEs have been described (case reports of hemolytic anemia, red cell aplasia, neutropenia, 
thrombocytopenia, myelodysplasia, and hemophilia A) with intracerebral pathogenicity index.  A hematologic irAE needs to be 
distinguished from transient changes in laboratory values that can occur during initiation of an immune response (e.g., 
lymphocytosis, eosinophilia, neutrophilia, monocytosis can be observed following treatment). Development of persistent or 
progressive cytopenias shou ld prompt evaluation of potential causes. In cases where an obvious cause cannot be identified, an 
autoimmune cause should be considered and investigated accordingly. Since the CTCAE definition of thrombocytopenia describes 
absolute platelet levels rather than a change in cell number, it is not a reliable tool for evaluating potentially life-threatening 
cytopenias.   
Severity  Management  
Grade 1  • Continue IP with close clinical follow -up and laboratory evaluation  
Grade 2  • Hold IP; consider permanent discontinuation.  
• Prednisone 0.5- 1 mg/kg/day or equivalent.  
Grade 3  • Permanently discontinue IP.  
• Prednisone 1-2 mg/kg/day or equivalents (oral or IV depending on symptoms and speed of development).  
• Hematology consult;  consider hospitalization, transfusion per existing guidelines (minimum number of units to 
relieve symptoms of anemia or to return subject to safe Hgb range), folic acid supplementation.  
Grade 4  • Permanently discontinue IP.  
• Prednisone 1-2 mg/kg/day; if no improvement on or if worsening on corticosteroids or severe symptoms on 
presentation, initiate other immunosuppressive drugs, such as rituximab, IVIG, cyclosporine, infliximab, MMF, 
ATG.  
• Hospitalize; hematology consult; transfuse per existing guidelines.  
Immune 
Thrombocytopenia Severity  Management  
Grade 1  • Continue IP with close clinical follow -up and laboratory evaluation.  
Grade 2  • Hold IP until AE has reverted to Grade 1.  
• Administer oral prednisone 1 mg/kg per day (dosage range, 0.5 – 2 mg/kg per day) for 2-4 weeks after which 
time this medication should be gradually tapered to lowest effective dose.  
• IVIG may be used in conjunction with corticosteroids if a more rapid increase in platelet count is required.  
Grade 3 or 4  • Hold IP until AE has reverted to Grade 1. Hematology consult.  
• Prednisone 1-2 mg/kg/day or equivalent.   
• IVIG 1 g/kg may be used with corticosteroids when a more rapid increase in platelet count is required.  This 
dosage may be repeated if necessary.  
• If treatment with corticosteroids and/or IVIG has been unsuccessful, subsequent treatment may include rituxim ab, thrombopoietin receptor agonists, or more potent immunosuppression

 3.6 Discontinuation of Investigational Product 
SL-279252 should be discontinued by the investigator when a participant meets one of the 
conditions requiring discontinuation outlined in S ection  3.5.  The investigator may, however, elect 
to discontinue SL-279252 for an AE , laboratory abnormality, or intercurrent illness which, in the 
judgment of the investigator, presents substantial clinical risk to the subject with continued dosing 
of the IP . If SL-279252 is permanently discontinued for reason s other than progressive disease or  
withdrawal of consent , the participant  will remain in the study to be evaluated for disease 
progression, and survival.  See the SOA in Section  6  for data to be collected at the time of 
discontinuation of SL -279252.   
3.7 Criteria to Resume Treatment  
A participant may resume IP per the guidance outlined in S ection  3.5.  If the criteria to resume 
treatment are met, the subject should restart treatment at the next scheduled time point per protocol.    
3.8 Participant Discontinuation/Withdrawals from Study  
• A participant  may withdraw from the study at any time at his/her own request; or may be 
withdrawn at any time at the discretion of the investigator for safety, behavioral, 
compliance, or administrative reasons. This is expected to be uncommon. 
• At the time of dis continuing from the study, an early discontinuation visit should be 
conducted, as shown in the SOA in S ection  6. See SOA for data to be collected at the time 
of study discontinuation and follow -up and for any further evaluations that need to be 
completed. The participant will be permanently discontinued both from the IP and from 
the study at that time.   Every effort must be  made to continue follow -up of participants  for 
protocol- specified safety follow -up procedures to capture AEs, SAEs, and unanticipated 
problems (UPs).  
• If the participant  withdraws consent for disclosure of future information, the Sponsor may 
retain and con tinue to use any data collected before such a withdrawal of consent. 
• If a participant withdraws from the study, he/she may request destruction of any samples 
taken and not tested, and the investigator must document this in the site study records. 
3.9 Lost to F ollow- up 
• A participant  will be considered lost to follow -up if he or she repeatedly fails to return for 
scheduled visits and is unable to be contacted by the study site. 
 
• The following actions must be taken if a participant fails to return to the clinic fo r a required 
study visit:  
o The site must attempt to contact the participant  and reschedule the missed visit as 
soon as possible and counsel the participant  on the imp ortance of maintaining the 
assigned visit schedule and ascertain whether the participant  wishes to and/or

 o Before a participant is deemed lost to follow up, the investigator or designee must 
make every effort to regain contact with the participant  (where possible, 3 telephone 
calls and, if necessary, a certified letter  sent to the participant’ s last known mailing 
address or local equivalent methods). These contact attempts should be documented 
in the participant’s  medical record.  
 
o Should the participant  continue to be unreachable, he/she will be considered as lost 
to follow up and withdrawn from the study. 
3.10 Premature Termination or Suspension of Study  
The Sponsor reserves the right to close the study site or terminate the study at any time for any 
reason. Written notification, documenting the reason for study suspension or termination, will be 
provided by the Sponsor to investigators, the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ), Health 
Canada, E uropean M edicines A gency  and other regulatory authorities. If the study is prematurely 
terminated or suspended, the  investigator will promptly inform the Institutional Review 
Board/Institutional Ethics Board ( IRB/IEC)  and w ill provide the reason(s) for the termination or 
suspension.  Study sites will be closed upon study completion. A study site is considered closed 
when all required documents and study supplies have been collected or destroyed and a study- site 
closure visit has been performed.  
The investigator may initiate study -site closure at any time, provided there is reasonable cause and 
sufficient notice is given in advance of the intended termination. 
Reasons for the early closure of a study site by the Sponsor or investigator may include but are not 
limited to:  
• Failure of the investigator to comply with the protocol, the requirements of the 
IRB/IEC or local health authorities, the Sponsor's procedures, or GCP guidelines 
• Inadequate recruitment of participants by the investigator 
• Discontinuation of further development of the IP 
• Determination of unexpected, significant, or unacceptable risk to participants  
3.11 Duration of T reatment  
In the absence of treatment delays due to AE(s), treatment may continue until one of the following 
criteria applies:  
• Disease progression  per iRECIST or RECIL 2017;  NOTE : See Section  8.3 for 
 criteria allowing for continuing treatment past initial progression . 
• Death  
• Intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of treatment  
• Unacceptable AE (s) 
• Participant  decides to withdraw from the study 
• General or specific changes in the participant's condition render the participant 
unacceptable for further treatment in the judgment of the investigator 
• Participant  non- compliance

 • Pregnancy  
• Termination of the study by Sponsor 
All women of childbearing potential should be instructed to contact  the investigator immediately 
if they suspect they might be pregnant (e.g., missed or late menstrual period) at any time during 
study participation.  The investigator should immediately notify PrimeVigilance upon knowledge 
of pregnancy (S ection  7.6).  
The investigator may consider discontinuing IP after agreement  with the S ponsor if a subject has 
achieved maximal clinical benefit (a durable CR  or PR or SD of >6 months).  The subject will be 
followed until confirmed disease progression as per protocol. Subject may be eligible for treatment 
past progression if they meet criteria as outlined in Section  8.3.   
Impact of ADA on clinical efficacy (non -response or loss of response to the IP) and safety (product 
specific immunogenicity risk) will be evaluated  and reported  on an on- going basis  once a validated 
ADA assay becomes available.  If a subject develops ADA, the Sponsor and investigator may take 
into consideration these factors in assessing the duration of the therapy.   
3.12 Duration of Follow- Up 
Safety follow -up is at least 90  days after t he last dose of SL -279252 (S ection  6).  Subject s who are 
withdrawn from study for unacceptable AE(s) will be followed until resolution or stabilization of 
the AE.  Participants  who permanently discontinue IP for reasons other than progression will 
continue with disease assessments until progression (per iRECIST or RECIL) or star t of another 
anti-cancer  therapy.  Participants  who discontinue IP for any reason other than withdrawal of 
consent will be followed  for survival.   
3.13 End-of Study Definition  
The end -of-study is defined as the point of final data capture (the point at which all required data 
has been collected to answer the research questions in the protocol).  At  least 3 months  of follow 
up from the last subject enrolled is required.

In the case of unintentional occupational exposure notify the Sponsor and consult the SPM . 
Refer to the SPM  for detailed procedures for the disposal and/or return of unused IP. 
5.2.3 Administration  
Doses of SL -279252 are to be administered as an IV infusion via an infusion pump or syringe 
pump that can ensure precision to at least 0.1 mL /min for the infusion rate at lower doses.  
Infusion rate:  The duration of infusion stipulated for each dose  is outlined  in Table 5: SL -279252 
Dose Escalation Plan  in Section  3.2.4.  
NOTE : A physician must be present at the site or immediately available to respond to emergencies 
during all administrations of IP.  A fully functional resuscitation facility must be available.   IP 
must not be administered via IV push or bolus but as an IV infusion using an infusion or syringe  
pump.  
5.2.4 Storage 
SL-279252 must be stored in a secure area under the appropriate physical conditions for the 
product.  Access to and administration of SL -279252 drug product  will be limited to the 
investigator and authorized site staff.  SL -279252 must be dispensed or administered only to 
subjects enrolled in the study and in accordance with the protocol.   
SL-279252 drug product vials are to be stored frozen at a temperature range of -85°C to -65°C.   
Maintenance of a temperature log is required. The drug product should be stored protected  from 
light.  
The expiry date, where required, is stated on the product label.   
5.3 Product Accountability  
In accordance with local regulatory requirements, the investigator  or designated site staff must 
document the amount of IP dispensed and/or administered to study subj ects, relevant dates, 
dilution amounts, SL-279252 lot or batch numbers as on the label, and the amount received from 
the Sponsor, when applicable.  Product accountability records must be maintained throughout the 
course of the study.  Refer to the SPM for further detailed instructions on product accountability. 
5.4 Dosing and C hange in Weight  
The actual body weight in kg will be used for dose calculation in all subjects whose body weight ** 
is ≤100 kg.  For subjects with body weight >100 kg, the dose to be administered should be the 
same as that calculated for a subject weighing 100 kg.  The subject should be dosed according to 
CONFIDENTIAL    SL01 -DEL -101 
Compound: SL-279252  Version no: 07  
84 
 their C1D1 weight throughout the study (mg/kg) if there is no signifi cant change in their weight 
from the weight recorded at the C1D1 visit.  A change in weight (i.e., increase or decrease) of the 
subject by 10% OR greater will require re-calculation of dose (mg/kg).  
**Subject  weight should be rounded to a whole number prior to calculating the dose to be 
administered (e .g., 72.5 kg should be rounded up to 73 kg, 72.4 kg should be rounded down to 
72 kg). 
5.5 Physician Availability Required for Administration of SL -279252 
SL-279252 has a risk for inducing CRS and IRRs. A physician must be present on site or 
immediately available to respond to emergencies  every time a subject is  administered SL -
279252.  F ully functional resuscitation facilities  must be available  and close in proximity to the 
infusion room.  Prompt recognition of AEs and immediate medical attention is essential.  
5.6 Monitoring Dose Administration  
SL-279252 must be administered in an outpatient oncology treatment center or inpatient  unit to 
enable close monitoring of subjects and proactive management of  AEs. As SL -279252 contains 
only human protein sequences, the chance for SL -279252 to be immunogenic and induce allergic 
HSRs should be low.  However, as with any biologic  therapy , infusion or allergic HSRs are 
possible.  Based on the pre- clinical toxicology studies, is anticipated that subjects could also be at 
risk to develop CRS.  Therefore, appropriate drugs and medical equipment to treat acute HSRs and 
monitoring and management of  CRS must be immediately  available, and study personnel must be 
trained to recognize and treat these toxicities.  Subjects will be monitored prior to, during, and 
after infusion of SL -279252.  Vital signs will be measured as outlined in the Schedule of 
Assessments (SOA) in Sectio n 6 and as needed.  In the event of any Grade IRR (including CRS), 
subjects will be admitted for closer observation  until resolution of symptoms. 
5.7 Treatment of Investigational Product Overdose 
In the event of an overdose (defined as administration of a dose and/or schedule greater than the 
dose and/or schedule that had been studied to date) of SL -279252, the investigator should: 
• Contact the Sponsor immediately  
• Closely monitor the subject for AEs/SAEs and laboratory abnormalities for at least 2 weeks following the infusion. The appropriate AE management guideline should be followed (Section 3.5 ). The pharmacologic effect (e.g., expansion of lymphocytes) 
could persist even after the IP is no longer detectable in the serum.  Subject should 
have recovered from toxicities that occurred because of the  excess dose before the next 
scheduled dose is administered.
 
 
• Obtain a serum  sample for PK analysis within 24 hours of the event if requested by 
the Sponsor (determined on a case -by-case basis)  
• Document the quantity of the excess dose as well as the duration of the overdosing in the electronic case report form (eCRF)  
CONFIDENTIAL    SL01 -DEL -101 
Compound: SL-279252  Version no: 07  
85 
 • If a SAE related to overdose of the IP occurs, it should be documented and reported 
accordingly (Section 7.5) 
Decisions regarding dose interruptions  for overdose of IP  will be made by the investigator in 
consultation with the Sponsor Medical Monitor based on the clinical evaluation of the subject. 
6. STUDY ASSESSMENT S AND PROCEDURES   
• Study procedures and their timing are summarized in the Schedule of Assessments 
(SOA). Protocol waivers or exemptions are not allowed. 
• Assessments throughout the study are calendar based starting from the first day of 
dosing (day 1) in the first treatment  period. Dose interruptions should not alter the 
assessment schedule for any subsequent treatment period. 
• Adherence to the study design requirements, including those specified in the SOA, is essential and required for s tudy conduct. 
• All screening evaluations must be completed and reviewed to confirm that potential 
subjects  meet all eligibility criteria. The investigator will maintain a screening log to 
record details of all subjects  screened and to confirm eligibility or  record reasons for 
screening failure, as applicable.  
• Procedures conducted as part of the participant’s routine clinical management (e.g., 
blood count)  and obtained before signing of the informed consent ( ICF) may be utilized 
for screening or baseline purposes provided the procedures met the protocol -specified 
criteria and were performed within the time -frame defined in the S OA. 
• Immediate safety concerns should be discussed with the Sponsor immediately upon 
occurrence or awareness to determine if the subject should continue or discontinue SL -
279252. 
• Blood volumes for correlative studies of PK, ADA, cytokines, immunophenotyping, receptor occupancy, cfNA and other laboratory tests are provided  in the Study 
Laboratory Manual (SLM)   
 
Please consult the SLM  for details  and blood volumes required . Estimates of 
blood requirements for the study are provided in Appendix Section 16.8 .

88 j. Cardiac Assessments ( obtain within 28 days of first dose) : 1) Electrocardiagram (E CG):  12 -lead ECG reading must be performed at screening  to serve as 
baseline for comparison with ECG obtained for safety  reason.  2) ECHO: An ECHO must be performed at screening for comparison with ECHO obtained for 
safety reason.  
k. Tumor Assessment:  Tumor assessments are required for all subjects within 28 days prior to enrollment. Baseline and o n-treatment tumor assessments  for solid 
tumors by iRECIST should include  CT with contrast of chest , abdomen, and pelvis and other known sites of disease at each time point. Bone scan and positron 
emission tomography (PET)/CT  should be performed only if clinically indicated.  Baseline and o n-treatment tumor assessment for lymphoma by RECIL 2017  
should be done usi ng CT scan with contrast and PET /CT of neck,  chest , abdomen , and pelvis and other known sites of disease at each time point . Please refer to 
Section 8 for requirements  regarding disease assessment.  Tumor assessments must be performed at screening and at the following intervals until disease 
progression is confirmed: approximately every 8 weeks through week 24  (e.g., C3D1 , C5D1 , C7D1 ), every 12 weeks up to year 2 (prior to cycle s 10, 13, 16, 19, 
22, 25, 28  and 31), and then every 6 months (prior to cycle s 37, cycle 43, etc.) up to conclusion of the study.   Confirmatory scans should be performed at least 4 
weeks (>28 days), but no longer than 8 weeks after initial documentation of an objective respons e. Subjects who discontinue study treatment  for reasons other 
than disease progression (e.g., AE or withdrawal of consent ) will be monitored for radiologic response until start of another anti -cancer therapy, or disease 
progression, withdrawal of consent or death.  
l. PK/immunogenicity (i.e., ADA ) and cytokine  sampling (Dose Escalation Cohorts):  PK, ADA, and cytokine  time points for collection  of samples  are outlined 
in supplementary tables in Section  6.1.1.  (Table  6, Table 7 and Table 8). Blood volumes required  are provided in the SLM . PK, ADA, cytokine  sample s should 
not be collected from infusion port for drug delivery i.e., recommend  having a separate line in the opposite arm for sample collection. If subject has positive ADA 
test on D1 of cycle 13,  then follow up predose  samples  for PK/ADA should be collected every ~90 days  on D1 of subsequent  treatment cycles until ADA resolve s 
to baseline.  If ADA positivity  is detected within 7 -30 days after the last dose  of SL -279252 , then follow up testing for PK/ ADA should be performed at monthly  
intervals until ADA resolves to baseline . 
m. Correlative laboratory studies :  Refer to supplementary Table 9 for details  in Section  6.1.2  plus see the SLM  for amount of blood needed.

n. SL-279252 Adm i
nistration : SL-279252 should be administered on D1, D8, and D15 according to the prescribed dosing schedule without deviation in cycle 1 to 
align with the safety DLT assessment and sample (PK, ADA, etc.) collection schedules. Beginning on cycle 2, day 1, a window of + /- 1 day is allowed for 
scheduled dosing days for drug administration. 
o. AE Monitoring : Subjects will be followed continuously for AEs during the study and for 90 days after the last dose of IP. After a subject is discontinued from 
SL-279252 due to progressive disease  or for other reasons, any ongoing AE should be followed until resolution (or return to baseline) and documented in the 
eCRF. If another anti -cancer agent is started, only SAEs and AEs that occur prior to starting the new anticancer therapy should be recorded.  In the event of a 
continuing SAE or a non- serious AE, the subject  will be asked to return for follow -up until the SAE or AE has resolved or is deemed to be continuing indefinitely.  
AEs will be characterized per NCI- CTCAE criteria v5.0 and events recorded in the eCRF.  
• Ad hoc blood samples  for clinical safety labs  should be collected for AE related to IRR and/or CRS event s as noted in Section  6.6.6.1  and the SLM . 
p. Archival tumor tissue (from most recent biopsy):  Provide formalin -fixed -paraffin -embedded (FFPE) tissue on slides (recommended minimum of 10 slides) or 
a block of formalin- fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue (the latter  is preferred ). Refer to Section 6.9.2.2  and the SLM for details.  
 
q. Tumor Biopsy : Paired biopsies (pre - and on -treatment) obtained in subjects who have tumor accessible to core- needle biopsy.   The on -treatment biopsy should 
be obtained during the first cycle on or between D16- D23. On -treatment biopsies of responding or progressing lesions may be obtained for further characterization 
of the changes in the TME. Please refer to Section  6.9.2.1 and SLM for details regarding biopsy .

279252: hematology profile, chemistry profile, coagulation profile, pregnancy test. Baseline CT or PET/ CT or MRI tumor assessments are required  for all subjects 
within 28 days prior to enrollment.  Subjects will be enrolled based on local PD -L1 tumor testing results. Any PD -L1 tumor testing results prior to enrollment are 
acceptable.  
b. Assessment Window:  A physical exam, weight and ECOG performance status obtained for a subject within 24 hours prior to dosing on Cycle 1, Day 1 is 
acceptable. With the exception of Screening assessements  and unless otherwise specified, assessments performed at ≤ 3- week intervals will have a +/- 3- day 
window and assessments performed at > 3- week intervals will have a +/ - 1-week window. Assessments throughout the study are calendar based starting from the 
first day of dosing (day 1) in the first treatment period. Dose interruptions should not alter the assessment schedule for any subsequent treatment period.  
c. Inclusion/Exclusion criteria:  Subjects must meet eligibility criteria prior to first dose of SL -279252 on C1/D1.  
d. Vital Signs:  BP, HR, T  and respiratory rate (RR) must be measured after the subject has been sitting for  at least  five min.  Pulse oximetry will be collected to 
coincide with vital sign time points noted below.  
1) Collect vital signs during  Cycle 1  on Day 1 , D8, D15 : Predose (within 30 min of starting the infusion ) and 15 min (± 5 min), 0.5 hr (± 5 min), 1 hr (±10 
min), 1.5 hr (± 10 min) and 2 hr (± 10 min) after SOI . 
2) Collect vital signs on dosing days ( Cycles  ≥ 2, Days 1 and 15):  Predose (within 30 minutes of starting the infusion ) and at the EOI (± 2 min)  
e. Pregnancy Test:  A serum pregnancy test ( β-hCG) or urine pregnancy test must be performed at screening for all FCBP  within 72 hrs  of starting SL -279252. 
Repeat this test every 8 weeks during SL -279252. Contr aception should be continued for at least 30 days after the last dose of SL -279252. 
f. Clinical Laboratory Tests (Hematology/Clinical Chemistry): Clinical laboratory tests will be performed at local laboratories according to the laboratory’s 
normal procedures.  See Section  6.6.6 for list of laboratory test s required.  
g. Coagulation Tests:  PT,  INR,  APTT, fibrinogen, d -dimer ( the latter test a t screening  and then as needed for clinical assessment) 
h. Thyroid Function Test : TSH, and free T4 tests will be performed at screening, C2D1, C3D1, C4D1 and then every 8 weeks .   
i. Antiviral Testing:  Please see exclusion criterion 17 in Section 4.3 .  
j. Cardiac Assessments  (obtain within 28 days of first dose) : 1) ECG:  12-lead ECG reading must be performed at screening to serve as baseline for comparison 
with ECG obtained for safety reason.  2) ECHO : An ECHO must be performed at screening to serve as baseline for comparison with ECHO obtained for safety 
reason.  
k. Tumor Assessment:  Tumor assessments are required for all subjects within 28 days prior to enrollment . Baseline and on -treatment tumor  assessments  for solid 
tumors by iRECIST should include  CT with contrast of chest , abdomen, and pelvis and other known sites of disease at each time point . Bone scan  and positron 
emission tomography (PET)/CT  should be performed only if clinically indicated.  Baseline and on -treatment t umor  assessment for lymphoma by RECIL 2017 
should be done using CT scan with contrast and PET/CT of neck, chest , abdomen , and pelvis and other  known sites of disease  at each time point.  Please refer to  
Section 8 for requirements regarding disease assessment.  Tumor assessments must be performed at screening and at the following intervals until disease progression 
is confirmed: approximately  every 8 weeks through w eek 24 (e.g., C3D1, C5D1, C7D1), every 12 weeks up to year 2 (prior to cycles 10, 13, 16, 19, 22, 25, 28 and 
31), and then every 6 months (prior to cycles 37, cycle 43, etc.) up to conclusion of the study.  Confirmatory scans should be performed at least 4 weeks (>28 days), 
but no longer than 8 weeks after initial documentation of an objective response. Subjects who discontinue study  treatment for reasons other than disease progression 
(e.g., AE or with drawal of consent ) will be monitored for radiologic response until start of another anti -cancer therapy,  or disease progression , withdrawal of 
consent or death.  
l. Sparse PK , immunogenicity (i.e., ADA) and cytokine sampling ( Dose Expansion Cohorts): PK/ADA/cytokines  time points for collection a re outlined in 
supplementary PK tables  in Section  6.3.1 (Table 14 and Table 15). Blood volumes required are provided in the SLM .  PK, ADA, cytokine samples should not 
CONFIDENTIAL    SL01 -DEL -101 
Compound: SL-279252  Version no: 07  
100 be collected from infusion port for drug delivery  i.e., recommendation is to use a separate line in the opposite arm for sample collection.  If subject has 
positive ADA test on D1 of cycle 13, then follow up predose samples for PK/ADA should be collected every ~90 days on D1 of subsequent treatment cycles until 
ADA resolves to baseline. If ADA positivity is detected within 7 -30 days after the last dose of SL -279252, then follow up testing for PK/ADA should be performed 
at monthly intervals until ADA resolves to baseline.  
m. Correlative laboratory studies :  Refer to supplementary Table 16 for details in Section  6.3.2  plus the SLM.  
• Complement   
• Immunophenotyping and receptor occupancy  
 
n. cfNA: Collect blood  prior to dosing into 2 separate cf NA Streck tubes and invert to mix thoroughly as described in SLM.  
o. SL-279252 Administration : SL-279252 should be administered on D1, D8, and D15 according to the prescribed dosing schedule without deviation in cycle 1 to 
align with the safety assessment and sample (PK, ADA, etc.) collection schedules. Beginning on cycle 2, day 1, a window of +/ - 1 day is allowed for scheduled 
dosing days for drug administration.  
p. AE Monitoring : Subjects will be followed continuously for AEs  during the study and for 90 days after the last dose of IP. After a subject is discontinued from SL -
279252 due to progressive disease or for other reasons, any ongoing AE should be followed until resolution (or return to baseline) and documented in the eCRF. If 
another anti -cancer agent is started, only SAEs and AEs that occur prior to starting the new anticancer therapy should be recorded.  In the event of a continuing 
SAE or a non- serious AE, the  subject will be asked to return for follow -up until the SAE or AE has resolved or is deemed to be continuing indefinitely.  AEs will 
be characterized per NCI- CTCAE criteria v5.0 and events recorded in the eCRF.  
• Ad hoc blood samples for clinical safety labs should be collected for AE related to IRR and/or CRS events as noted in Section  6.6.6.1  and SLM . 
 
q. Archival tumor tissue  (from most recent biopsy) : Provide  formalin -fixed -paraffin -embedded ( FFPE ) tissue on slides ( recommended minimum of 10 slides) or 
a block of FFPE tissue  (the latter is preferred ). Refer to Section 6.9.2.2 and the SLM for details.  
r. Tumor Biopsy : Paired biopsies  (pre- and on- treatment) obtained in subjects who have tumor accessible to core- needle biopsy.  .  The on- treatment biopsy  should 
be obtained during the first cycle on or between D16 -D23. On-treatment biopsies of responding or progressing lesions may be obtained for further characterization 
of the changes in the TME . Please refer to Section  6.9.2.1 and SLM for details regarding biopsy. 
s. Cycle 2 Days 15 and  16: Collect biomarker samples outlined in Table 16 in Section 6.3.2 . Refer to  the SLM  for details . 
t. Post-Treatment : A Post -Treatment visit will be conducted within 30 days (±3 days) after the last dose of SL -279252, or prior to the start of a new therapy, or at 
the end of study, or if the subject's participation is terminated early.  See AE monitoring footnote above.      
u. Follow -Up: All subjects will be contacted after discontinuing study therapy to collect survival status. Subjects should be contacted every 3 months (+/ - 14 days) 
until death, withdrawal of consent or subject is lost to follow -up. Contact may include c linic visit, telephone contact, email or mail to document survival status.

6.6.6.2 Pregnancy Test ing 
All FCBP  subjects must have a negative pregnancy test (serum  or urine ) at Screening. A separate 
assessment is required if a negative Screening pregnancy test is obtained more than 72 hours before 
the first dose of SL -279252. Subjects with a positive pregnancy test must be excluded from the 
study. Subjects with a negative pregnancy test result must agree to use an effective contraception  
method as described in Appendix Section 16.2.   In the rare event that β -hCG is elevated as a tumor marker, please see guidance in Appendix 
Sectio n 16.2.1

6.7 Pharmacokinetics  
6.7.1 Intensive P K Sampling  in Dose Escalation ( Schedule 1 or Schedule 2 ) 
Intensive serial  PK samples will be collected for all subjects enrolled in dose escalation  cohorts. 
In the first cycle  starting on Day 1 , samples will be collected pre -dose, at the EOI , and 0.5, 1, 1.5, 
2, 3, 4, 6, 8 and 24 hours post  EOI. Additional PK samples will be collected at 48, 72, and 96 hours 
post EOI. Actual  dose administration and PK sampling times will be documented  in the subject’s 
medical record . Sample collection out to  96 hours post EOI may be truncated during dose finding 
based on emerging data (e.g., lower doses may require collection of PKs  only through the 48-hou r 
time point following the first infusion).  Subsequently, pre -dose, EOI, 2-hour, 6-hour and 24-hour 
post EOI sample s will be obtained on C1D15/D16  and C2D1/D2 . On C3/D 1 and C4/D1, a  pre-
dose, EOI, and 6 -hour post EOI sample will be collected. Beyond cycle 4, only pre -dose samples 
will be collected for ADA and PK analyses on D1 of C7, C10, C13 and C25.  A final PK /ADA 
sample should be collected within 7 – 30 days after permanently stopping treatment with SL -
279252. 
Refer to supplementary tables provided in Se ction s 6.1.1 and 6.2.1 for details.

113 6.7.2 Sparse P K Sampling  in Dose Expansion ( Schedule 1 or Schedule 2 ) 
Sparse PK samples  will be collected for  all subjects enrolled in Expansion Cohorts. Actual dose 
administration and  PK sampling times will be documented  in the subject’s medical record . A 
sample will be collected pre -dose, at the EOI and  then 2 and 6 hours after the infusion on C1/D1. 
A 24-hour post  EOI sample will be collected on Day 2 of the first cycle  (C1/D2). Subsequently, 
pre-dose, EOI, 2-hour, 6-hour , and 24 -hour post EOI sample s will be obtained on C1D15/D16 and 
C2D1 /D2. A predose, EO I and  6-hour post EOI sample will be collected on  C3/D1  and cycle 4/D1 . 
Beyond cycle 4, only pre -dose samples will be collected for ADA and PK analyses on D1 of C7, 
C10, C13 and C25. A final PK /ADA s ample should be collected within 7 – 30 days after 
permanently stopping treatment with SL -79252. 
Refer to supplementary tables provided in Section s 6.3.1 and 6.4.1. for details. 
6.7.3 Pharmacokinetic Endpoints  
The Pharmacokinetics  of SL-279252 will be described using the PK  parameters listed in Table 
20. 
Table 20: Serum  SL-279252 PK Parameters  
Cmax Maximum observed concentration  
Tmax Time of maximum observed concentration  
AUC 0-last The area under the serum  concentration time curve, from time 0 to the last 
quantifiable concentration, calculated by a combination of linear and 
logarithmic trapezoidal methods (Linear up/log down method).  
AUC 0-t The area under the serum  concentration time curve, from time 0 to time=t , 
calculated by a combination of linear and logarithmic trapezoidal methods 
(Linear up/log down method).  
AUC 0-inf Area under the serum  concentration time curve from time 0 extrapolated to 
infinity, calculate d as AUC last + C last/terminal elimination rate constant ( λz). 
Reliability of AUC 0-inf values is contingent on the percent of the total area 
obtained by extrapolation: 
AUC 0-inf values with <20% of the total area coming from C last/λz are 
considered acceptabl e.   
Any exceptions to the above procedures will be clearly documented/justified 
in the PK report.  
AUC tau The area under the serum  concentration time curve, over the dosing interval 
following doses > first dose, calculated by a combination of linear and 
logarithmic trapezoidal methods (Linear up/log down method).

6.8 Anti -drug Antibody Assessments  
Pre-dose blood samples  will be collected f rom all subjects enrolled in the study ( Dose E scalation 
and Dose Expansion C ohorts) for determination of ADA  prior to the first dose, on C1D15, and on 
CONFIDENTIAL    SL01 -DEL -101 
Compound: SL-279252  Version no: 07  
114 the first day of cycles 2, 3, 4, 7, 10, 13 and 25 and within 7- 30 days of the last dose of SL -279252. 
The following endpoints will be calculated for each subject: 
• ADA titer and status (positive , negative, inconclusive) at each timepoint 
• ADA onset  
• ADA duration  
• Persistent vs. transient ADA  
6.9 Pharmacodynamic/ Biomarker Assessments  
Blood samples and tumor tissue (where available)  will be collected from all subjects  in this study 
for pharmacodynamic/ biomarker research as specified in the SOA  for the appropriate dosing 
schedule (Schedule 1 or Schedule 2). Below is an overview of the Pharmacodynamic /Biomarker 
plan, the sample requirements, supporting analytics, and intended goal of performing the proposed 
assays.  A separate SLM detailing the preparation, storage, and shipping requirements for blood or 
fresh and archival  tumor tissue  collection during the study will be provided. 
6.9.1 Pharmacodynamic Assessments in Blood  
6.9.1.1 Cytokine and C hemokine  Analysis  
The levels of serum proteins such as cytokines and chemokines  will be measured as  noted in 
Section 6.6.6.  Levels of serum cytokines /chemokines  may provide context to AEs observed in 
subjects  following infusion of SL -279252 and may act as pharmacodynamic markers of activity . 
Serum cytokines will be measured for SL -279252 in dose escalation and dose expansion cohorts. 
6.9.1.2 Peripheral Blood M ononuclear C ells for R eceptor O ccupancy  
Receptor occupancy of SL -279252 on PD -L1 and OX40 will be measured by flow cytometry. This 
analysis will provide evidence that SL -279252 is engaging its expected targets and allow receptor 
occupancy (free and total) to be calculated and assessed across dose groups . Samples for receptor 
occupancy will be collected during dose escalation  and dose expansion.  
6.9.1.3 PBMC for I mmunophenotyping  
Protein expression of phenotypic markers, proliferation markers, and activation markers will be 
assessed by flow cytometry. The composition of T cells in the peripheral blood may provide 
insights into the mechanism of action of SL -279252 and serve as biomarkers for immune response. 
Samples for immunophenotyping will be collected during dose escalation and in  dose expansion. 
6.9.1.4 Cell-free N ucleic A cids for Exome S equencing  and TMB  
Cell-free nucleic acid s (cfNA)  samples will only be collected in subjects in Dose Ex pansion 
Cohorts . These samples may be utilized for exome sequencing  and TMB a nalyses. Assessing 
mutations (including point, insertions/deletions, etc.) in the coding sequence of nucleic acids  
isolated from  nucleic acids shed by tumor cells into the peripheral blood or in the actual tumor 
environment will allow for evaluation of the mutatio nal load, which can be correlated with subject 
response. Additionally, e xome sequencing can provide insights into other genetic 
CONFIDENTIAL    SL01 -DEL -101 
Compound: SL-279252  Version no: 07  
115 pathways/mechanisms associated with either response or resistance to SL -279252 (e.g., mutations 
in antigen present ation ).   
6.9.2 Phar macodynamic A ssessment of Tumor T issue  
6.9.2.1 Fresh Tumor Biopsies  
The efficacy of cancer immunotherapy is conditioned by the infiltration of tumors by activated 
tumor- specific T cells. The activity of these T cells will be affected by the immunosuppressive 
environment in the tumor  (e.g., T- regulatory cells, and suppressive myeloid cells such as myeloid-
derived suppressor cells and M2 macrophages). Therefore, the direct evaluation of the “immune landscape” inside the tumor is of great value for understanding the mechanism of action of SL -
279252 and optimizing cancer immunotherapy. Immunohistochemistry ( IHC) analyses and exome 
sequencing will be performed on the fresh tumor  samples. The immune infiltrate of the tumor will 
be assessed by visual izing and assessing the phenotype of cells in the tumor micro-environment 
by IHC.  Add itionally, the spatial distribution and redistribution upon treatment of immune cells 
within the TME has also been found to be linked to the response to immunotherapies and can be evaluated by these procedures. The immune profile of the tumor could be used to predict clinical response or validate the mechanism of the immune response to SL -279252. Exome sequencing 
analysis will be used to detect mutations in genes associated with mechanisms of resistance (e.g., defects in antigen presentation ) or response.  Additional DNA/RNA analyses may be performed. 
For th ese reason s, core needle biopsies are highly recommended in subjects with tumors accessible 
for biopsy enrolled in the D ose Escalation or Expansion Cohorts. Three cores at each biopsy time 
point should be obtained for research studies (see SLM for details).  
Paired biopsies are requested at Screening/ Baseline (to evaluate the immune status of the tumor 
before SL -279252 treatment), and at Week 3 in the  first treatment cycle at any  time between Days 
16-23, (at the expected time of an immune response to SL -279252 therapy) .  If the baseline biopsy 
is non- evaluable, the Sponsor will inform the investigator that the follow -up on- treatment biopsy 
can be omitted. The time interval for the second biopsy may be change d by the Sponsor if 
pharmacodynamic data from the Dose Escalation indicates a different time point would be more 
suitable.  
It is strongly recommended that the biopsies are obtained from non- target and measurable lesions. 
If such a lesion is not present, a biopsy may be obtained from a target lesion that is 2 centimeters 
(cm) or more. The same lesion should be biopsied at both Screening and subsequent time points , 
and measurement of the lesion that is biopsied should be documented. Where possible, lymph node biopsies should be avoided (except for lymphoma subjects)  as reliable measure of tumor 
infiltrating lymph ocytes (or their activation) in a background of (non- tumor) lymphoid tissue is 
challenging. 
If feasible, biopsy material should be collected after disease progression has been confirmed and 
documented, ideally on lesions that have progressed. 
Priority for fresh biopsy tissue analysis based on tissue availability is IHC  (including central 
confirmation of PD -L1 tumor testing)  > exome sequencing if cfNA is non -evaluable  > additional 
CONFIDENTIAL    SL01 -DEL -101 
Compound: SL-279252  Version no: 07  
116 DNA and/or RNA analyses . Samples collected on treatment or at the time of progression will be 
compared with baseline results.  
Biopsy Collection Safety Considerations and Procedure  
Three tissue cores per subject should be obtained at time points noted in the SOA.  Further details 
are provided in the SLM.  
Only  percutaneous  biopsies  will be performed  on subject s with solid tumors.  Mediastinal, open 
surgical or laparoscopic, gastrointestinal, peritoneal or bronchial endoscopic biopsies are permitted 
ONLY when obtained incidentally to a clinically necessary procedure and not for the sole purpose of the clinical trial.  No laparoscopic, or endoscopic or open surgical procedure will be performed solely to obtain a biopsy for this protocol.  However,  excisional  biopsy or endoscopic biopsy is  
allowed  if medically -indicated  and can b e used for analysis.  Biopsies  will be sent for analyses  as 
defined  in the protocol.    
Contraindications to percutaneous biopsy:  
• Significant coagulopathy or anticoagulation treatment that cannot be adequately 
corrected.  
• Severely compromised cardiopulmonary function or hemodynamic instability. 
• Lack of a safe pathway to the lesion.  
• Inability of the subject  to cooperate with, or to be positioned for, the procedure. 
 
If a site is deemed appropriate for biopsy with minimal risk (no more than 2% risk of serious 
complication requiring hospitalization) to the participant by agreement between the investigators 
and Interventional Radiology, an attempt at biopsy should be made.  
The use of imaging to facilitate biopsies will be decided by members of the Interventional 
Radiology team at the clinical site and may include ultrasound, CT scan, or MRI.  Should CT scan 
be needed for biopsy, the number of scans for each procedure will be limited to the minimum 
number needed to safely obtain a biopsy.  Tumor biopsies and local anesthesia will be performed only if they are of low risk (<2% major complication rate) to the participant as determined by the  
investigators and Interventional Radiologist. 
6.9.2.2 Archival Tumor  
TMB analysis may  be performed on archival tumor tissue. Archival tumor tissue  (1 block preferred  
or a minimum of 10 unstained slides of FFPE tissue ; see SLM for details) that is representative of 
current disease status (e.g., metastatic disease)  is requested in Dose Escalation and Dose Expansion 
Cohorts. If an inadequate amount of archived tissue is available, the subject may still participate 
in the study if they meet eligibility criteria for  the study. Archival tissue may be accepted as a pre -
treatment specimen  in lieu of a fresh biopsy if the subject has not undergone treatment since time 
of specimen collection and if the sample was collected via core needle biopsy.  Priority for archival tissue analysis based on tissue availability is IHC > TMB * > additional DNA 
and/or RNA  analyses. Samples collected on treatment or at the time of progression will be 
compared with baseline results .  
CONFIDENTIAL    SL01 -DEL -101 
Compound: SL-279252  Version no: 07  
117 *NOTE : Preferred source for TMB analysis  is cfNA; h owever, if cfNA is inadequate for analysis 
the archived tumor tissue will be used. 
6.10 Assessment of Anti -tumor Activity  
Anti-tumor activity will be assessed in solid tumors according to iRECIST, and in lymphoma 
according to RECIL 2017. Treatment beyond progression is permitted provided the subject  meets 
protocol specified criteria  (see Section  8.3).  Imaging studies including CT scan , FDG -PET or MRI 
for disease assessment will be performed at baseline and at the following intervals until disease 
progression is confirmed: every 8 weeks through week 24, and every 12 weeks thereafter until 
year 2 , and every 6 months until study conclusion. Refer to Section 8 for additional details.  All 
subject s will be followed up for survival unless they withdraw consent. 
6.11 Unscheduled Visit   
In the event of an unscheduled visit, the subject should undergo safety screening to include a physical exam, vital signs (HR, BP, T , and RR) and pulse oximetry.  Clinical hematology and 
chemistry labs may be collected  if considered necessary for subject assessment . The reason for the 
unscheduled visit should be documented in the eCRF. If the subject is experiencing an AE , they 
should be referred to the appropriate  medical  service for proper follow up of the AE (s). All AEs 
or SAEs  reported by the subject or observed by the investigator should be documented and 
reported ; this includes  relevant medical information gathered during the unscheduled visit related 
to clinical assessment of AEs or SAEs  (Section  7.5). 
7. SAFETY ASSESSMENTS   
Subjects will be followed continuously for AEs starting when a subject has signed the ICF, 
throughout the course of treatment  and for 90 days after the last dose of IP. After a subject is 
discontinued from SL -279252 due to progressive disease  or for other reasons, any ongoing AE s 
should be followed until resolution (or return to baseline) and documented in the eCRF. If another 
anti-cancer agent is started  within 90 days after the last dose of SL -279252, only SAEs and AEs 
that occur prior to starting the new anticancer therapy should be recorded. All observed or 
volunteered AEs (serious or non -serious) and abnormal laboratory test  findings, if applicable, 
whether suspected to have a  causal relationship to the SL -279252 or not will be recorded in the 
subject medical record and in the eCRF.  A Es will be graded according to NCI -CTCAE  v5.0.  For 
all AEs, sufficient information will be pursued and/or obtained to permit an adequate determination of seriousness and outcome of the event (i.e., whether it should be classified as a 
SAE  or not) and an assessment of the causal relationship between the AE  and SL-279252.  A Es 
will be followed until resolution (or return to baseline) or stabilization.  Refer to Section  7.5 for 
documentation and reporting of AEs . 
  
CONFIDENTIAL    SL01 -DEL -101 
Compound: SL-279252  Version no: 07  
118 7.1 Assessment of Severity  
The descriptions and grading scales found in the revised NCI-CTCAE version 5.0 will be utilized 
for AE reporting.  A copy of these criteria can be downloaded from the website: https://ctep.cancer.gov/protocoldevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm. 
• Grade 1: Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations 
only; intervention not indicated 
• Grade 2: Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age 
appropriate instrumental ADL* 
• Grade 3: Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; 
hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; limiting self -care 
ADL**  
• Grade 4: Life -threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated 
• Grade 5: Death related to AE  
 
*Instrumental ADL refer to preparing meals, shopping for groceries or clothes, using the telephone, managing money, 
etc. 
** Self -care ADL refer to bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, taking medications, and not 
bedridden.  
 
For AEs not included in the NCI -CTCAE  v5.0 grading system, the following guidelines will be 
used to describe severity. 
• Mild – Event s require minimal or no treatment and do not interfere with the subject’s daily 
activities.  
• Moderate – Events result in a low level of inconvenience or concern with the therapeutic 
measures. Moderate events may cause some interference with functioning.  
• Severe – Events interrupt a participant’s usual daily activity and may require systemic drug 
therapy or other treatment. Severe events may be potentially life -threatening or 
incapacitating.  
NOTE : A distinction should be drawn between serious and severe AEs . Severity is an estimate or 
measure of the intensity of an AE, while the criteria for serious AEs are indications of adverse 
subject outcomes for regulatory reporting purposes. A severe AE need not necessarily be 
considered serious and a serious AE need not be considered severe.  
7.2 Definitions  for Safety Parameters  
Event  Definition  
Adverse Event (AE)  The AE observation period starts at the time of signing informed consent and includes 
baseline or washout periods, even if no study treatment has been administered.   
AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject  to whom the IP  has been 
administered, r egardless of whether the event is considered related to that product.  An 
AE is also an undesirable medical condition  due to a study -related procedure .  
Adverse Reaction (AR)  AR is an untoward and unintended response in a subject  to an IP. A causal relationship 
between a trial medication and an AE is at least a reasonable possibility, i.e. the 
relationship cannot be ruled out.  
Serious Adverse  An AE or suspected AR that is considered "serious" if, in the view of either the 
investigator or Sponsor , it results in any of the following outcomes:  
CONFIDENTIAL    SL01 -DEL -101 
Compound: SL-279252  Version no: 07  
119 Event  Definition  
Event (SAE)  or Serious 
Adverse Reaction  
(SAR)  • Death  (Note : death is an outcome not an event)  
• A life -threatening AE (an event in which the subject  was at risk of death at the time 
of the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused 
death if it were more severe)  
• Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization 
• A persist ent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to 
conduct normal life functions  
• A congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
• Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospitalization may be considered serious when, based upon appropriate medical 
judgment, they may jeopardize the participant and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such medical events include allergic bron chospasm requiring intensive treatment in an 
emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in 
inpatient hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
Laboratory test(s) that 
meet definition of an AE or SAE:  
 • Any laboratory test result that meets the definition of an AE or SAE or requires 
holding or discontinuation of SL -279252, or requires corrective therapy, must be 
documented appropriately.  
• Ad hoc labs should be collected as noted in Section 6.6.6.1  above if  AEs of  IRR 
and/or CRS occur . 
The investigator must review the laboratory report, document this review, and record 
any clinically relevant changes occurring during the study in the subject’s medical 
record and recorded in the AE section of the eCRF.  The laboratory reports must be filed 
with the source documents. Clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings are thos e 
which are not associated with the underlying disease, unless judged by the investigator to be more severe than expected for the participant's condition.  
All laboratory tests with clinically significant abnormal values during participation in the study should be repeated until the values return to normal or baseline or are no longer considered clinically significant by the investigator.  
If such values do not return to normal/baseline within a period judged reasonable by the investigator, the etiology should be identified, and the Sponsor notified.  
If laboratory values from non- protocol specified laboratory assessments performed at 
the institution’s local laboratory require a change in subject management or are 
considered clinically significant by the investigator (e.g., AE, SAE or dose 
interruption), then the results must be recorded in the eCRF.  
Unexpected Adverse 
Reaction  An adverse reaction (causality related Adverse Event), the nature, severity or outcome of which is not consistent with the reference safety information section of the product IB. Product reference safety information is contained in the current Guidance for  
Investigators in Section   6.0 of the Investigator’s Brochure  provided to the Investigator 
by the Sponsor.  
Suspected Unexpected 
Serious Adverse 
Reaction (SUSAR)  Suspected Adverse Reaction (causality related AE) that is serious and unexpected.  
 
7.2.1 Events  not Qualifying as AEs/SAEs  
The following are not considered to be A Es or SAEs:  
• Medical or surgical procedures ( e.g., endoscopy, appendectomy). The condition that leads 
to the procedure is considered the AE. 
CONFIDENTIAL    SL01 -DEL -101 
Compound: SL-279252  Version no: 07  
120 • Elective procedures, planned hospitalizations, and procedures for treatment of conditions 
noted in the patient’s medical history (present prior to signing the ICF) that have not worsened are not considered AEs.  
• Situations where an untoward medical occurrence did not occur ( i.e., admission to hospital 
for social circumstances) . 
• Anticipated day -to-day fluctuations of pre -existing medical conditions that were present at 
start of study.  These conditions are considered part of the patient’s medical history and 
must be adequately documented on the appropriate page of the CRF. 
• Clear progression of disease under study should not be reported as an AE or SAE (unless 
the investigator considers the progression of underlying neoplasia to be atypical in its 
nature, presentation or severity from the normal course of the disease in a particular 
patient). Findings that are clearly consistent with the expected progression of t he 
underlying cancer should not be reported as an adverse event, and hospitalizations due to the progression of cancer do not necessarily qualify for an SAE. 
• In the case where the medical condition is known when the participant enters the trial, only 
worse ning (increased frequency or intensity of the episodes or attacks) will be documented 
as an AE. If the disease is detected during the trial, and if repeated episodes enable diagnosis of a chronic disease, the episodes will be grouped together in the CRF, and the diagnosis will be clearly described. 
• Laboratory abnormalities: An isolated, out-of- range laboratory result in the absence of  
any associated, clinical finding may or may not be considered an AE; the Investigator’s evaluation should be based on a consideration of the overall clinical context. 
 
7.3 Classification of an Adverse Event 
7.3.1 Assessment of Causality  
The clinician’s assessment of an AE's relationship to IP  is part of the documentation process, but 
it is not a factor in determining what is or is not reported in the study. If there is any doubt as to 
whether a clinical observation is an AE, the event should be reported. All AEs must have their relationship to IP  assessed. In a clinical trial, the IP  must always be suspect. To help assess  
causality , the following guidelines are used.  
Related – The AE is known to occur with the IP , there is a reasonable possibility that the IP  caused 
the AE, or there is a tempor al relationship between the IP and event. Reasonable possibility means 
that there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the IP and the AE.   
Not Related – There is not a reasonable possibility that the administration of IP  caused the event, 
there is no temporal relationship between IP and event onset, or an alternate etiology has been 
established .   
7.3.2 Expectedness  
The Sponsor will be responsible for determining whether an AE is expected or unexpected.  
• Unexpected  - An AE will be considered unexpected if the nature, severity, or frequency 
of the event is not consistent with the safety information s ection  6.0 (Guidance for 
CONFIDENTIAL    SL01 -DEL -101 
Compound: SL-279252  Version no: 07  
121 Investigators) of the IB  [SL2018IB001_01]  for the IP.  "Unexpected," as used in this 
definition, also refers to AEs or AR s that are mentioned in the IB as occurring with a class 
of drugs or as anticipated from the pharmacological properties of the drug not specifically 
mentioned as occurring with the IP  under investigation.   
• Expected  - AEs that are common and known to occur for the IP being studied.  
Expectedness refers to the awareness of AEs previously observed, not on what might be anticipated from the properties of the IP. 
7.4  Timing  for Event Assessment and Follow- up 
All AEs occurring while on study must be documented appropriately regardless of relationship. 
All AEs will be followed to adequate resolution.  The occurrence of an AE or SAE may come to 
the attention of study personnel during study visits and interviews of a study subject  presenting for 
medical care, or upon review by a study monitor.  
Any medical condition that is present at the time that the subject  is screened will be considered as 
baseline and not reported as an AE. However, if the pre -existing condition deteriorates at  any time 
after the subject signs the main study ICF, it will be recorded as an AE. Unanticipated problems 
will be recorded in the data collection system throughout the study.  
The highest grade in severity for each AE will be documented. AEs characterized  as intermittent 
require documentation of onset and duration of each episode.  
 
7.5 Procedures for Recording and Reporting of Adverse Event s  
Event  Reporting Procedures  
Adverse Event  Subjects will be followed continuously for AEs during the study and for 90 days after the last 
dose of IP. After a subject is discontinued from SL- 279252 due to progressive disease or for 
other reasons, any ongoing AE should be followed until resolution (o r return to baseline) and 
documented in the eCRF, regardless of whether the event(s) is attributed to trial medication. If 
another anti -cancer agent is started, only SAEs and AEs that occur prior to starting the new 
anticancer therapy should be recorded. The following information will be recorded: description, 
date of onset and end date, severity, assessment of relatedness to trial medication , and action 
taken.  Follow -up information should be provided as necessary.  AEs will be followed either 
until resolu tion, or the event is considered stable.  
 It will be left to the Investigator’s clinical judgment to decide whethe r an AE is of sufficient 
severity to require the subject ’s removal from treatment.  A subject  may also voluntarily 
withdraw from treatment due  to what he or she perceives as an intolerable AE.  If either of these 
occurs, the subject  must undergo an end of trial assessment and be given appropriate care under 
medical supervision until symptoms cease, or the condition becomes stable . 
 
Serious 
Adverse Event  
      
 
 
Serious  The study clinician will complete a SAE Form within the following timelines:  
• All deaths and immediately life -threatening events, whether related or unrelated, will 
be recorded on the SAE Form and submitted to the study Sponsor or designee within 
24 hours of site awareness.  
• Other SAEs regardless of relationship, will be submitted to the study Sponsor  or 
designee within 24 hours of site awareness .  
 
All SAEs will be followed until satisfactory resolution or until the site investigator deems the 
event to be chronic or the adherence to be stable. Other supporting documentation of the event

123 recommendations. The study Sponsor will inform the regulatory authorities ( i.e., FDA, European 
Medicines Agency , Health Canada, etc.)  of the temporary halt and the disposition of the study. 
7.9 Safety Oversight  
An SMC  will be imp lemented in this study and will consist of investigators and Sponsor 
representatives. SMC  meetings will be conducted monthly (or more frequently if required) during 
dose escalation provided subjects have been enrolled and data are available to be reviewed.  The 
SMC  will operate in accordance with the SMC  charter which will define roles and accountabilities 
and the process for safety review.   
Throughout the conduct of the study, safety data will be reviewed for each subject  on an ongoing 
basis. Additionally, periodic safety reviews will be undertaken by the SMC . Based on the severity 
of the DLTs, indicators of potential anti -tumor activity, and other factors, a recommendation on 
whether to modify the dose and/or study design; or continue enrollment will be made by the 
Sponsor collaboratively with input from the SMC . Regulatory authorities and IRBs/IECs  will be 
notified of any decisions to prematurely  halt the study or subject  enrollment.  (See section 14.1 for 
details on safety meetings).  
A safety governance board will also be formed.  The remit of this board will be to conduct periodic 
safety reviews across all trials conducted by the S ponsor including protocol SL01- DEL -101. The 
safety governance board will be comprised of two physicians  with pertinent expertise who are not 
involved in the design, conduct or analysis  of SL01- DEL -101. The safety governance board will 
operate in accordance with a charter which will define roles and accountabilities and the process 
for their  safety review.  
8. ANTI -TUMOR  ACTIVITY ASSESSMENTS  
Although t he clinical benefit of SL -279252 has not yet been established, the intent of offering this 
IP is to provide a possible therapeutic benefit, and thus the participant will be carefully monitored 
for tumor response and symptom relief in addition to safety and tolerability.  
For the purposes of this study, participants should be evaluated for response as outlined in the 
SOA. Confirmatory scans should be performed at least 4 weeks  (>28 days), but no longer than 8 
weeks after initial documentation of an objective response.  All participants who receive  at least 3 
doses of SL -279252 and had the first disease assessment at the 8- week time point will be 
considered evaluable for response.    Assessments must be performed on a calendar schedule and should not be affected by dose interruptions or delays. Refer to the SOA ( Section 6) for the schedule of disease assessments. More 
frequent disease assessments  may be performed at the discretion of the investigator. For subjects 
whose disease may be followed by well- characterized tumor markers, disease assessments should 
include results of tumor marker assessments. If study treatment is withdrawn for reasons other than disease progression, radiographic disease assessments should continue as per the SOA until documented disease progression, the start of new anti -cancer therapy, withdrawal of consent or 
death. See Section s 8.3 for criteria  for continuing treatment past disease progression.

124 8.1 Disease Assessment for Solid Tumor Histologies  
For solid tumor histologies, response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the 
international criteria proposed by the RECIST working group for use in trials testing 
immunotherapies (iRECIST)  [Seymour, 2017] .   
The iRECIST guidelines are based on principles used in RECIST 1.1 [ Eisenhauer, 2009] .  The 
responses assigned using iRECIST have a prefix of “i” (i.e., immune) to differentiate from 
responses assigned using RECIST 1.1. e.g. iCR, iPR, iSD, iUPD (unconfirmed progressive 
disease), iCPD (confirmed progressive disease).  The major change for iRECIST is the concept of 
resetting the bar  if RECIST 1.1 progression is followed at the next assessment by tumor shrinkage.  
iRECIST defines progression based on RECIST 1.1 principles ; however, progression requires 
confirmation.   The  RECIST 1.1 guidelines and iRECIST guidelines are included in this document 
for this reason  (Section 16.6).   
Screening and on -treatment disease assessments will include imaging of the chest, abdomen and 
pelvis (e.g., computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), bone scan, PET/CT 
and/or plain radiographs). CT scan with contrast of the chest, abdomen and pelvis is the preferred 
method to measure lesions selected for response assessment and should be performed at screening and on- treatment.  PET/CT scan cannot be substituted for lesion measurements. For subjects with 
known brain metastases, MRI of the brain with contrast should be performed at screening and on-treatment to assess for response or progression. Bone scans and PET/CT scans should be 
performed at screening and on- treatment as clinically indicated.  
Screening/b aseline CT or MRI  tumor assessments are required for all subjects within 28 days prior 
to enrollment. All post -baseline assessments require imaging of disease sites identified by baseline 
scans.  The method used to document screening disease  status should be used consistent ly 
throughout the study to facilitate comparison of scan results.  
If a CT scan with contrast is contraindicated  (i.e., hypersensitivity reaction to contrast agent) , MRI 
may be used as an alternative method of baseline disease assessment, except for chest CT scan. If 
a chest CT scan with contrast is contraindicated, a chest CT scan without contrast should be performed.  
8.1.1 Assessment of Response  by iRECIST  – Solid Tumors  
Changes in the largest diameter (unidimensional measurement) of the tumor lesions and the 
shortest diameter in the case of malignant lymph nodes are used in the i RECIST criteria . Please 
see Appendix Section 16.6 for detailed information regarding iRECIST methodology and criteria.  
 
8.1.2 Response and Stable Disease Duration  
Response duration will be measured from the time measurement criteria for iCR/iPR (whichever 
is first recorded) are first met until the first date tha t recurrent or progressive disease is objectively 
documented, taking as reference the smallest measurements recorded on study (including baseline). Stable disease (SD) duration will be measured from the time of start of treatment until 
CONFIDENTIAL    SL01 -DEL -101 
Compound: SL-279252  Version no: 07  
125 the criteria for pro gression are met, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (including 
baseline).  
8.2 Disease Assessment for Lymphomas  
International Working Group consensus response evaluation criteria in lymphoma (RECIL 2017) 
will be used for assessment of tumor response  in participant s with lymphoma [ Younes, 2017] .   
Screening /baseline  and on- treatment disease assessments will include  both CT scan with contrast 
of the neck, chest, abdomen and pelvis and FDG -PET scan. CT scan with contrast of the neck, 
chest, abdomen and pelvis is the preferred method to measure lesions selected for response assessment. For subjects with known brain metastases, MRI of the brain with contrast should be 
performed at screening and on- treatmen t to assess for response or progression. Other imaging 
including MRI, bone scan, and/or plain radiographs will be performed as clinically indicated.  
Screening/baseline MRI, CT or PET/CT tumor assessments are required for all subjects within 28 
days prior to enrollment. All post- baseline assessments require imaging of disease sites identified 
by baseline scans. The method used to document screening disease status should be used 
consistently throughout the study to facilitate comparison of scan results.  
If a CT scan with contrast is contraindicated (i.e. , hypersensitivity reaction to contrast agent), MRI 
may be used as an alternative method of baseline disease assessment, except for chest CT scan. If 
a chest CT scan with contrast is contraindicated, a chest CT scan without contrast should be performed.  
8.2.1 Assessment of Response by RECIL – Lymphomas  
In participant s with disseminated disease, a maximum of three target lesions should be selected 
and used to estimate tumor response.  Please see Appendix  Section 16.7 for detailed information 
regarding RECIL methodology and criteria. 8.3 Criteria for Treatment Beyond  Initial Progression  
Subjects will be permitted to continue IP beyond initial progressive disea se provided the subject 
does not have clinical symptoms of progression, is tolerating IP, and is gaining clinical benefit  as 
assessed by the investigator.  The subject must be made aware of the potential benefits and risks 
of continuing the IP in the setting of progressive disease by providing a separate written informed 
consent.  
 
The subject may continue to be treated until one of the following criteria is met: 
• Confirmed progressive disease (defined in Appendix Section  16.6.3 for solid tumors and 
Appendix Section 16.7.1 for lymphomas) 
• Meets any of the criteria for discontinuation of IP  (see Section 3.6) 
• Develops clinical symptoms or signs such that the benefit -risk ratio of continuing therapy 
is no longer justified 
• Experiences rapid progressive disease  with risk to vital organs or critical anatomical sites 
requiring urgent medical intervention  
• Decline in ECOG PS

126 9. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
9.1 Description of Statistical Methods  
The study has 2 parts: dose escalation and dose expansion. During dose escalatio n, the primary 
objective is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of SL -279252 and to identify the MTD or MAD 
of SL -279252 in participants with locally advanced or metastatic select malignancies. Schedule 1 
will be evaluated first, with dose escalation f ollowing the K eyboard design with a target DLT rate 
of 30% (acceptable range of 25-33.3%).  Ten DLs are planned with a planned maximum sample 
size of 42 subjects . Single subject cohorts may  initially be enrolled until the subject in a single 
subject cohort experiences  a qualifying ≥ Grade 2 toxicity (see Section s 3.2.5 and 3.2.6) or a DLT 
OR DL 6 is reached. Subsequently, cohorts of at least 3 subjects will be enrolled. The full dose 
escalation rules are outlined in Appendix Section 16.3. Th e Sponsor , in consultation with the SMC , 
may decide to stop enrollment in S chedule 1 early ( e.g., based on safety, pharmacodynamics) and 
begin enrollment in S chedule 2 (see Section  3.2.7). If Schedule 2 is opened, dose escalation will 
also follow the Keyboard design with the same target DLT rate of 30%. We anticipate that 4 DLs 
will be evaluated in S chedule 2 with a planned m aximum sample size of 15 subjects. All cohorts 
will enroll at least 3 subjects in S chedule 2 (see full dose escalation rules in Appendix Section 
16.3). NOT E: If Schedule 2 is opened, the Sponsor  may also elect to stop enrollment in schedule 
2 early ( e.g., based on safety) and resume enrollment in S chedule 1. If both schedules are 
evaluated, the MTD or MAD may  be determined for each schedule (denoted MTD1/MAD1 and 
MTD2/MAD2). The MTD(s) will be determined using isotonic regression based on DLTs observed during dose escalation (see Section 9.2.1).  A MAD will be reported if a schedule is fully 
evaluated, but the DLT rate never reaches the target range of 25 -33.3%.   
During the dose escalation  additional subjects  (approximately 6)  may be enrolled into a 
pharmacodynamic cohort  to obtain additional pharmacodynamic data at select dose levels that 
have previously completed evaluation for safety and not exceeded the MTD.   
After dose escal ation, up to 2 expansion cohorts (n=up to 15 subjects each) may be enrolled to 
further explore up to 2 different doses. The Sponsor , in consultation with the SMC , will determine 
the dose (s) and schedule to be evaluated during dose expansion based on the totality of data in the 
dose escalation cohorts. The primary objective during dose expansion is to further characterize the 
safety of SL -279252. S pecial attention will be paid to IRRs and toxicities that require 
discontinuation of SL -279252. See Section 9.2.2 for details on the continuous toxicity monitoring 
that will be implemented across the expansion cohorts . The tumor types for dose expansion will 
be determined after review of data collected during dose escalation. The RP2D  will be determined 
after review o f data collected during both dose escalation and dose expansion and will take safety 
(including delayed toxicities that do not occur during the DLT period), pharmacodynamic s, PK, 
and efficacy into account. The RP2D will not exceed the MTD.  
9.2 Sample Size and  Statistical Hypotheses 
9.2.1 Dose Escalation 
The planned sample size for the dose escalation part of the study is 63 subjects. For Schedule 1, 
the maximum planned sample size for dose escalation will be 42 subjects, and for Schedule 2, the 
CONFIDENTIAL    SL01 -DEL -101 
Compound: SL-279252  Version no: 07  
127 maximum planned sampl e size for dose escalation will be 15 subjects.  The planned number of 
subjects to obtain additional pharmacodynamic data at select dose levels is approximately 6 
subjects.  
These sample sizes for dose escalation were chosen based on simulation results demonstrating 
good operating characteristics (see tables below) with these sample sizes using the Keyboard design (see dose escalation rules in Appendix Section 16.3). NOTE:  The maximum planned 
sample sizes may be revised if additional DL s are evaluated or if more subjects (i.e., subjects 
available for dosing beyond the number required in a cohort) are enrolled than anticipated. The Sponsor, in consultation with the SMC , may also elect to add subjects if additional safety data are 
needed to select a dose and schedule  for the expansion cohorts.  Six (6) subjects must be treated at 
a dose level  to confirm safety and tolerability  before a dose can be used in an expansion cohort. 
All simulation results are based on 5000 simulations and assume the following: 
• The target DLT rate is 30% (acceptable range of 25 -33.3%)  
• Dose escalation will stop early if 12 subjects are enrolled at the same DL  (See Scenarios 1 
and 3 in Appendix Section 16.3) 
• If there is more than a 95% chance that the current dose is above the MTD, that dose and 
higher doses will be eliminated from the trial to prevent exposing future subjects to overly 
toxic doses 
9.2.1.1 Simulations for Schedule 1 (assuming 10 dos e levels ) 
The first set of simulations assume the following: 
• Subjects are enrolled in c ohorts of 3 (i.e., dose escalation decisions are made after the 3 subjects in a cohort 
are evaluated)  
• Maximum sample size = 42

133 9.3 Populations for Analyses 
For the analysis, the following populations are defined: 
Population  Description  
Enrolled  All subjects  who sign the  main study  ICF.  
Screen Failures  A subject who signs the informed consent but  has not received any 
dose of SL -279252   
All Treated  All subjects who receive  at least one dose of  SL-279252 . Safety data 
will be evaluated based on this population . 
DLT Evaluable  All subjects in the All Treated population who receive at least 2 
doses of SL-279252 for Schedule 1 or at least 3 doses for Schedule 
2, complete the safety follow up through DLT evaluation period or 
experience any DLT during the DLT evaluation period. The DLT 
evaluation period is defined as the first 21 days or 28 days of 
treatment on Schedule 1 or Schedule 2, respectively. Evaluable 
subjects will be used to guide dose escalation and to determine the 
MTD  or MAD . 
Evaluable for Efficacy  A subject  who received at least 3 doses of SL -279252 and had at 
least one post -baseline disease assessment  or had progressed or died 
before the first post -baseline disease assessment . . 
Pharmacokinetic  All subjects in the All Treated population who received at least one 
dose of SL -279252 and have at least one evaluable post- dose sample 
collected. The PK population will be used for PK analysis.  
Pharmacodynamic  All subjects in the All Treated population for whom sufficient 
samples are available for th e analysis.  The pharmacodynamic 
population will be used for the pharmacodynamic data analysis.  
9.4 Statistical Analyses 
The statistical analysis plan (SAP) will be developed and finalized before database lock and will 
describe the participant populations to be included in the analyses, and procedures for accounting for missing, unused, and spurious data. This s ection  is a s ummary of the planned statistical analyses 
of the primary and secondary outcome measures. The planned statistical analyses for pharmacokinetic and specific pharmacodynamic markers that will be utilized in dose selection will also be summarized.  Other biomarker exploratory analyses will be described in the SAP  finalized 
before database lock.  
9.4.1 Analysis of the Primary Outcome Measures  
9.4.1.1 Dose Escalation 
During dose escalation, DLTs will be tabulated for evaluable subjects by dose level within each 
schedule. For s ingle subject cohorts, qualifying ≥ Grade 2 toxicities that trigger a change to at least 
3 subject cohorts will also be tabulated. F requency tables will be used to describe safety and 
tolerability parameters such as: AEs, irAEs , SAEs , fatal SAE s and irAEs leading to discontinuation  
of SL-279252. Tables will be presented for the whole population, and within each dose level  
separately. Changes in safety assessments (e.g., laboratory parameters , etc.) will also be 
summarized using descriptive statistics. These will also be presented for the whole population, and 
CONFIDENTIAL    SL01 -DEL -101 
Compound: SL-279252  Version no: 07  
134 within each dose level separately. Graphs may also be presented where appropriate. The All 
Treated population will be used for these analyses. 
The MAD will be reported, or the MTD will be estimated using isotonic regression (based on the 
DLTs observed in evaluable subjects ). A MAD will be reported if a schedule is fully evaluated, 
but the DLT rate never reaches the target range of 25 -33.3%.  Otherwise, an  MTD will be reported.  
Isotonic regre ssion is a way to estimate the MTD under the assumption that toxicity increases with 
dose. Specifically, the MTD is selected as the dose for which the isotonic estimate of the DLT rate 
is closest to the target DLT rate of 0.3. If there are ties, we select the highest dose level when the 
isotonic estimate is lower than the target DLT rate; and we select the lowest dose level when the 
isotonic estimate is greater than the target DLT rate.  When using isotoni c regression, the first step 
is to identify  the doses where the dose -toxicity monotonicity assumption is violated. The DLT 
estimate is then adjusted  for the  violators such that the final estimate of the DLT rate increases 
with the dose. The target DLT rate is then used to select the MTD. For example, suppose that when 
the trial is completed, th e observed DLT rates [# subjects who  experienced DL T]/[# evaluable 
subjects ] at five dose levels  are (0/3, 1/3, 0/3, 4/15, 2/4). In this example the observed DLT rate at 
Dose L evel 2 (i.e., 1/3=33%) is higher than the observed DLT rate at Dose Level 3 (i.e., 0/3=0%). 
To adjust for this violation, the  DLT estimates are replaced with their average, i.e., 
(1/3+0/3)/2=1/6, resulting in the isotonic regression DLT estimates (0/3, 1/6, 1/6, 4/ 15, 2/4) = (0%, 
16.7%, 16.7%, 26.7%, 50%), which monotonically increase s with the dose level. Based on this 
isotonic estimate, assuming that the trial goal is to find  the dose with the DLT rate of 30%, Dose 
Level 4 will be selected as the MTD. If there are no violators of the  dose-t oxicity monotonicity 
assumption, isotonic regression directly uses the observed DLT rates  as the final estimates for 
MTD selection. The Evaluable for Dose Escalation  population will be used for these analyses.  
NOTE:  for subjects who undergo intra -subject dose escalation, only DLTs that occur during the 
DLT period on the subject’s initial dose will be used for MTD determination.  
9.4.1.2 Dose Expansion  
During dose expansion, frequency tables will be used to describe safety and tolerability parameters 
such as: AEs, irAEs , SAEs , fatal SAE s and irAEs leading to discontinuation of SL-279252. 
Summaries will be presented within each cohort separately. C hanges in safety assessments (e.g., 
laboratory parameters  etc.) will also be summarized using descriptive statistics . These will also be 
presented within each cohort separately. Graphs may also be presented where appropriate.  The All 
Treated population will be used for these analyses. 
Continuous toxicity monitoring will be used to specifically monitor IRRs  and toxicitie s leading to 
discontinuation of SL -279252 as described  in Section 9.2.2. 
9.4.2 Analysis of the Secondary Outcome Measures  
ORR and CBR will be estimated and reported along with exact 95% confidence intervals.  Efficacy 
will be evaluated within each expansion cohort separately. Efficacy will be summarized by dose level during dose escalation and will be summarized across dose levels and across the study as a whole as appropriate. iRECIST will be the disease assessment tool for solid tumors  and RECIL 
2017 will be the disease assessment tool for lymphoma.  
CONFIDENTIAL    SL01 -DEL -101 
Compound: SL-279252  Version no: 07  
135 The RP2D  will be selected after review of all the data collected during dose escalation and 
expansion and will take safety (including delayed toxicities that do not occur during the DLT 
period), pharmacodynamics and efficacy into account. The RP2D will not exceed the MTD or 
MAD.  
9.4.3 Exploratory Analyses 
Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize changes from baseline in pl asma cytokine levels , 
cell counts and percenta ges of circulating immune cells . Complement activation by assessment of 
SC5b- 9 terminal fragment and immune cell activation state will also be evaluated . During dose 
escalation  and expansion, r eceptor occupancy  (free and total)  of SL -279252 on PD -L1 and OX40 
will be measured by flow cytometry and will be assessed within each dose level separately. During 
dose expansion, cfNA samples will be evaluated for  analys is for TMB  and exome sequencing.  
Associations between biomarkers and efficacy outcomes may be explored as appropriate. 
If paired biopsies are collected  in subjects from the dose escalation or expansion cohorts , they will 
be evaluated for  changes in the TME  pre-and post -treatment. Additional details will be provided 
in the SAP. Each subject will be followed for progression- free survival  and overall survival, and this 
information will be presented graphically using swimmer plots  or Kaplan -Meier plots . If 
appropriate, TTR, DOR, progression- free survival  and overall survival  may also be summarized 
using the Kaplan -Meier method, with medians reported along with 95% confidence intervals. 
9.5 Pharmacokinetic Analyses  
9.5.1 Pharmacokinetic Populations 
The PK population is defined as all subjects in the All Treated population who received at least 
one dose of SL-279252 and have at least one evaluable post- dose PK sample collected.  
All PK analys es and reporting will be performed according to applicable Standard Operating 
Procedures and protocol specifications. Programming of tables, figures, and listings will be 
performed using R version 3.4.0 or later (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, 
Austria). PK parameters will be calculated using Phoen ix® WinNonlin® 6.3 or later s oftware 
( ) using actual sampling times. If actual sampling times are not 
available, nominal sampling times will be used.   
Individual serum  concentrations will be listed by nominal times. Summaries of serum  
concentration data will include data for all subjects who receive at least one dose of SL -279252 
and have at least one evaluable serum  sample . Table summaries of serum  concentrations will be 
displayed versus nominal times. Figures of individual  subject drug concentrations versus actual 
sampling times will be presented on linear and semi -logarithmic scales by dose  and schedule , as 
appropriate. Figures of summarized  drug concentrations versus nominal sampling times will be 
presented on linear and semi -logarithmic scales by dose, as appropriate.  PK parameters for SL -
279252 will be calculated as described in Table 20 . Additional parameters may be calculated as 
necessary.  

CONFIDENTIAL    SL01 -DEL -101 
Compound: SL-279252  Version no: 07  
136 PK parameters will be calculated using non -compartmental methods for subjects with sufficient 
data to estimate the parameters.  PK parameter s will be listed  for each individual subject  and 
summarized by cohort, dose and schedule, as appropriate . The  following descriptive statistics will 
be provided: n (number of subjects with non- missing data), arithmetic mean (mean), s tandard 
deviation, standard error, arithmetic coefficient of variation (CV%), median, minimum, and 
maximum.  Geometric mean (geomean), geometric mean  CV%, lower 95% confidence interval 
around the geometric mean (95% confidence interval lower geomean), and upper 95%  confidence 
interval around the geometric mean (95% confidence interval upper geomean) will be calculated.  T
max and T last will be presented as median, minimum and maximum.  
9.5.2 Exploratory Exposure- Response Analyses 
Exploratory exposure -response and e xposure- safety relationships may  be performed by various 
methods that may include population PK/ pharmacodynamic analysis.  Exposure -response analysis 
may be explored by evaluating potential relationships between exposure and efficacy and/or safety 
parameters such as  incidence of ADA and AEs, receptor occupancy, cytokines, lymphocytes, and 
response rates.  
9.6 Anti -Drug Antibody Analysis 
Individual subject ADA titer and status (positive, negative, inconclusive) vs. nominal time will be reported and summarized by dose level during dose escalation and during dose expansion.  Onset 
and duration of ADA by subject , characterization of subjects as having a persistent or transient 
ADA response will also be summarized by dose level during dose escalation and  dose expansion.  
ADA isotype may be reported, if supported by the data. Descriptive statistics, including 95% 
confidence intervals where appropriate, will be reported for each endpoint.  
10. CLINICAL MONITORING   
Clinical site monitoring is conducted to ensure  that the rights and well- being of human subjects 
are protected, that the reported trial data are accurate, complete, and verifiable, and that the conduct 
of the trial complies with the currently approved protocol/amendment(s), with GCP, and with 
applicabl e regulatory requirement(s).  
• Monitoring for this study will be performed by Sponsor or its designees  
• Details of clinical site monitoring are documented in a Clinical Monitoring Plan ( CMP ). 
The CMP describes in detail who will conduct the monitoring, at what frequency 
monitoring will be done, at what level of detail monitoring will be performed, and the distribution of monitoring reports.  
• Independent audits  will be conducted by the Sponsor or designee of the Sponsor to ensure 
GCP and monitoring practi ces are performed consistently across all participating sites and 
that monitors are following the CMP.

140 Study participant research data, which is for purposes of statistical analysis and scientific reporting, 
will be transmitted to and stored a Sponsor location. This will not include the participant’s contact 
or identifying information. Rather, individual participants and their research data will be identified by a unique study identification number. The study data entry and study management systems used by research staff at the clinical sites  and by authorized representatives of the Sponsor will be 
secured and password protected. At the end of the study, all study databases will be de -identified 
and archived at a Sponsor location. 
13.4.1 Research Use of Stored Human Sam ples, Specimens, or Specimen Data  
• Intended Use: Samples and data collected under this protocol may be used to study the effects 
of the investigational drug on how one’s immune system reacts and how the body responds to 
this type of treatment in treating d ifferent types of cancers .  
• Storage: Access to stored samples will be limited to  specified study personnel/vendor  
personnel. Samples will be identified by  unique subject identification (ID) codes . Samples and 
data will be stored using subject ID assigned by the Sponsor and investigators.   
13.5 Future Use of Stored Specimens  
Specimens  collected for this study will be analysed  and stored at the Sponsor Data Repository  or 
Sponsor-approved vendor.  
During the conduct of the study, an individual subject  can choose to withdraw consent to have 
biological specimens stored for future research. However, withdrawal of consent related to bio-
sample storage, will not be possible after the study is completed.  
14. DATA HANDLING AND RECORD KEEPING  
14.1 Communication and Data Dissemination Plan 
During the study while subjects are receiving treatment with SL -279252, SMC  meetings will be 
held to review relevant data with the i nvestigators or delegates.  These meetings will be held once 
a month (or more frequently if required) during dose escalation to share safety data and 
communicate results of ongoing analyses. Available s afety, PK, pharmacodynamic , and clinical 
outcome data for all subjects at the time of th e scheduled SMC  Meeting will be reviewed and 
summarized.  Attendees of SMC  meetings will include but not be limited to clinical investigators 
(or designees), the Sponsor Medical Monitor and Statistician .  
The Sponsor  will remain in constant contact with the clinical sites during the enroll ment period to 
ensure that cohort enrollment during the dose escalation or  dose expansion phases of this study are 
completed as per protocol.  Investigators will be informed about available openings for enrollment 
on the trial and will be asked to pre -screen subjects to determine their potential for eligibility to 
avoid over -enrollment. Enrollment will be offered to all sites and slots filled based on  the Keyboard 
Design  method.   
Dose escalation decisions will be made based on the DLTs observed at the current dose level with guidance provided by the Keyboard design as stated in the study protocol.  All dose escalation  and 
dose expansion or safety decisions will be documented in writing with copies maintained at each site and the Trial Master File at the CRO .  
CONFIDENTIAL    SL01 -DEL -101 
Compound: SL-279252  Version no: 07  
141 14.1.1 Periodic Data Summaries for Investigators and Regulatory Agencies 
In addition to standard regulatory reporting requirements for serious AE s and annual reporting, the 
Sponsor will provide the following data summaries to Investigators and Regulatory Agencies: 
• During the conduct of the study, a summary of safety (SAE and AEs) will be provided 
every 6 months beginning with the date of the first subject enrolled.   
At the end of the dose escalation  and dose expansion, an outline of the key findings, including 
overall safety (SAEs, AEs), tolerability, PK, pharmacodynamic activity and anti -tumor activity; 
and the justification for the dose and schedule to take forward to Phase 2 (RP2D). 
14.2 Data Collection and Management Respons ibilities  
An eCRF will be used to record all subject data specified by this protocol. The eCRF must be 
completed by designated and trained study personnel.  The eCRF will be electronically signed by the Principal Investigator or a Sub- investigator listed on the Form FDA 1572.  Data collection is 
the responsibility of the clinical trial staff at the site under the supervision of the site investigator . 
The investigator is responsible for ensuring the accuracy, completeness, legibility, and timeliness of the data reported.  All source documents should be completed in a neat, legible manner to ensure 
accurate interpretation of data.   Source documents may include but are not limited to, study 
progress notes, e -mail correspondence, computer printouts, laboratory data, and drug 
accountability records.    
Data reported in the eCRF derived from source documents should be consistent with the source 
documents or the discrepancies should be explained and captured in a progress note and maintained in the subject ’s official electronic study record.  
Clinical data (including but not limited to AEs, concomitant medications, and expected ARs data) 
and clinical laboratory data will be entered into the study database, a 21 CFR Part 11 -compliant 
data capture system provided by the Sponsor . The data system includes password protection and 
internal quality checks, such as automatic range checks, to identify data that appear inconsistent, incomplete, or inaccurate. Clinical  data will be entered  into an electronic data capture system 
directly from the source documents.  
Study data will be entered into eCRFs at the study site.  Prior to database lock, programmed 
computer edit checks and manual checks will be performed to check  for discrepancies and 
reasonableness of the data.  All issues resulting from the computer -generated checks are to be 
resolved as quickly as possible with clarification from study sites. 
14.3 Study Records Retention  
The Sponsor follows US regulations and ICH guidelines in its retention policy.  
US IND regulations (21CFR 312.62c ) require that records and documents pertaining to the conduct 
of this study and the distribution of investigational drug(s) including eCRFs, consent forms, 
laboratory test results, and medication inventory records be kept on file by the Principal 
Investigator for 2 years following the date a marketing application is approved for the drug for the indication for which it is bein g studied.  If no application is to be filed or if the application is not 
CONFIDENTIAL    SL01 -DEL -101 
Compound: SL-279252  Version no: 07  
142 approved for such indication, these records must be kept until 2 years after the investigation has 
been discontinued and regulatory authorities  (i.e., FDA, Health Canada, European Medicines 
Agency, etc.) ha ve been notified.  ICH guidelines indicate that study documents should be retained 
until at least 2 years after the last approval of a marketing application in an ICH region and until 
there are no pending or contemplated marketing applications in an ICH region, or at least 2 years 
have elapsed since the formal discontinuation of clinical development of the IP. If there is a country 
or institutional policy that specific records and documents be retained for a longer period than descri bed above, the applicable sites must comply with those policies in addition to US and ICH 
policies.   
No study records should be destroyed without prior authorization from The Sponsor , the written 
consent of the Sponsor , if applicable. It is the responsibility of the Sponsor to inform the 
investigator when these documents no longer need to be retained. 
14.4 Protocol Deviations 
A protocol deviation is any noncompliance with the clinical trial protocol  or GCP requirements .  
The noncompliance may be either on the part of the subject,  the investigator, or the study site staff.  
As a result of deviations, corrective actions are to be developed by the site and imp lemented 
promptly.  
 It is the responsibility of the site to use continuous vigilance to identify and report deviations by completing the Sponsor Protocol Deviation Form to the Sponsor Medical Monitor or de signee as 
soon as protocol deviation is identified .  A completed copy of the Spons or Protocol Deviation 
Form will be maintained in the regulatory file.  All deviations must be addressed in study source 
documents, reported to Sponsor . Protocol deviations must be sent to the local IRB /IEC  per their 
guidelines. The site Principal Investigator is responsible for ensuring all study staff understands 
the local IRB/IEC  reporting guidelines and adhere to all related requirements and documentation.
 
Further details about the handling of protocol d eviations will be included in the study reference 
manual . 
14.5 Publications and Data Sharing Policy 
The Sponsor will comply with the requirements for publication of study results. In accordance 
with standard editorial and ethical practice, the Sponsor will generally support publication of 
multicenter studies only in their entirety and not as individual site data. I n this case, a coordinating 
investigator will be designated by mutual agreement. 
Authorship will be determined by mutual agreement and in line with the International Committee 
of Medical Journal Editors authorship requirements.

146 16.2 Contraception Requirements  
Females or males of reproductive potential must agree to avoid becoming pregnant or avoid 
impregnating a partner, respectively. Female or males of reproductive potential are required to use adequate methods of birth control from the time of screening (i.e., at least 14 days prior to D1 of 
SL-279252) through at least 30 days after the last dose of SL -279252.  
  
Definition of Female of Childbearing Potential : 
A female subject who is not sterile due to surgery (i.e., from  bilateral tubal ligation /occlusion, 
bilateral oophorectomy, bilateral salpingectomy or complete hysterectomy) or who does not have 
a congenital or acquired condition that prevents childbearing or who is not naturally post -
menopausal for at least 12 consecutive months.    
Definition of Female of Non- Reproductive Potential : 
Female subjects will be considered of non-reproductive potential if they:   
1. Are post- menopausal if defined as amenorrhoeic  for 12 consecutive months without an 
alternative medical cause. In women < 45 years of age a high follicle stimulating hormone 
(FSH) level in the postmenopausal range may be used to confirm a postmenopausal state in women not using hormonal contraception or hormonal replacement therapy. In the absence of 12 cons ecutive months of amenorrhea, a single FSH measurement is 
insufficient; 
OR 
2. Have had a hysterectomy and/or bilateral oophorectomy, bilateral salpingectomy or bilateral tubal ligation/occlusion, at least 6 weeks prior to screening; 
OR 
3. Have a congenital or acquired condition that prevents childbearing. 
 
Definition of Male of Non- Reproductive Potential : 
Male subjects will be considered of non- reproductive potential if they have azoospermia (whether 
due to having had a vasectomy or due to an underlying medical condition).    
Highly Effective Methods of Contraception (<1% failure rate) : 
For contraception, subjects should comply with one of the following:  
1. Practice abstinence† from heterosexual activity;  
OR 
2. Use (or have their partner use) acceptable contraception during heterosexual activity.   
 Acceptable methods of contraception are‡:  
• Single method (one of the following is acceptable):  intrauterine device  
 vasectomy of a female subject’s male partner  
 contraceptive rod implanted into the skin 
 
 
CONFIDENTIAL    SL01 -DEL -101 
Compound: SL-279252  Version no: 07  
147 • Combination Methods 
  Female Subjects: The following hormonal contraceptives may be used by  
female subjects and requires use of a male condom for the male partner:  
• oral contraceptive pill (estrogen/progestin pill or progestin-only pill) 
• contraceptive skin patch 
• vaginal contraceptive ring 
• subcutaneous contraceptive injection 
 
 Male Subjects: The f ollowing contraception methods may be used by female 
partners  and requires use of a male condom for the male subject: 
• diaphragm with spermicide  
• cervical cap with spermicide (nulliparous women only)   
• contraceptive sponge (nulliparous women only) 
• hormonal contraceptives including oral contraceptive pill 
(estrogen/progestin- only pill), contraceptive skin patch, vaginal 
contraceptive ring, subcutaneous contraceptive injection  
 †Abstinence (relative to heterosexual activity) can be used as the sole method of contraception if it is consistently employed as the subject’s preferred and usual lifestyle and if considered acceptable by local regulatory agencies and IRBs/Independent IECs.   Periodic abstinence (e.g., 
calendar, ovulation, sympto- thermal, post -ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable 
methods of contraception.   ‡If a contraceptive method listed above is restricted by local regulations/guidelines, then it does not qualify as an acceptable method of contraception for subjects participating at s ites in this 
country/region.  Subjects should be informed that taking the study medication may involve unknown risks to the fetus (unborn baby) if pregnancy were to occur during the study.  T o participate in the study,

In the rare event that β -hCG is elevated as a tumor marker, pregnancy should be excluded. At 
minimum, this requires obstetrics evaluation, serial β -hCG measurements and ultrasound to 
exclude pregnancy.

149 16.3.1.1 Dose Escalation – Schedule 1  
See Section  3.2.4 for the dose levels to be evaluated in schedule 1.  
The first subject will be enrolled at Dose Level 1 in a single subject cohort. Single subject cohorts 
will be enrolled until: 
• The subject i n a single subject cohort experiences  ≥ Grade 2 toxicity (see Section 3.2.5) or 
a DLT OR  
• Dose Level 6 is reached  without evidence of a DLT or other ≥  Grade 2 toxicity 
If a subject in a single subject cohort experiences ≥  Grade 2 toxicity or a DLT , 2 additional subjects 
will be added at that dose level (for a total of 3). Once a single subject cohort is expanded to 3, 
having a ≥  Grade 2 toxicity no longer guides dos e escalation (only DLTs do) and subsequent 
cohorts will now include at least 3 subjects. NOTE:  If a subject in a single subject cohort is not 
evaluable, an additional single subject cohort should be enrolled at the sam e dose level.  More than 
1 subject may be enrolled in a cohort if additional subject(s) are available  for dosing after 
consultation with the Sponsor. 
Once cohorts of at least 3 subjects begin enrollment (after expansion of a single subject cohort to 
3 or at Dose Level 6), the table in Section  16.3.1 will be used to guide dose escalation. 
• There will be a 3 -day stagger between the first and second subjects enrolled at a given dose 
level.  NOTE:  This requirement may change based on emerging data as per the SMC . 
• The column corresponding to the total number of evaluable subjects treated at the current 
dose level should be used to make the appropriate decision (i.e., escalate, stay at the same 
dose, de- escalate or eliminate).  
• If a subject is not evaluable, a decisio n can still be made based on the total number of 
subjects who are evaluable at the current dose without enrolling an additional subject 
(unless all subjects in a cohort are not evaluable*). 
• More than 3 subjects may be enrolled in a cohort if additional subject(s) are available for 
dosing after consultation with the Sponsor.  
*NOTE:  If all subjects in a cohort are not evaluable, an additional cohort should be enrolled at the 
same dose level.  
Dose escalation for schedule 1 may continue until: 
• The trial is sto pped for safety OR  
• The maximum sample size of 42 subjects is reached OR  
• The maximum sample size has not been reached but 12 subjects have been enrolled at the current dose level OR

150 • The Sponsor , in consultation with the SMC , decides to stop enrollment in s chedule 1 early 
(e.g., based on safety, pharmacodynamics ) and begin enrollment in s chedule 2 (see Section  
3.2.7)  
NOTE:  The maximum sample size of 42 may be revised if additional dose levels are evaluated or 
if more additional subjects (i.e., subjects available for dosing beyond the number required in a 
cohort) are enrolled than anticipated. The Sponsor, in consultation with the SMC , may also elect 
to add subjects if additional safety data are needed to select a dose and schedule for the expansion 
cohorts. Six (6) subjects must be treated at a dose level to confirm safety and tolerability  before a 
dose can be used in an expansion cohort. 
16.3.1.2 Dose Escalation – Schedule 2  
See Section  3.2.4 for the dose levels to be evaluated if schedule 2 is opened. 
Subjects will be enrolled in cohorts of 3, with the table in Section  16.3.1 used to guide dose 
escalation.  
• There will be a 3 -day stagger between the first and second subjects enrolled at a given dose 
level.  NOTE:  This requirement may change based on emerging data as per the SMC . 
• The column corresponding to the total number of evaluable subjects treated at the current 
dose level  should be used to make the appropriate decision (i.e., escalate, stay at the same 
dose, de- escalate or eliminate).  
• If a subject is not evaluable, a decision can still be made based on the total number of subjects who are evaluable at the current dose without enrolling an additional subject 
(unless all subjects in a cohort are not evaluable*). 
More than 3 subjects may be enrolled in a cohort if additional subject(s ) are available for 
dosing after consultation with the Sponsor.  
*NOTE:  If all subjects in a cohort are not evaluable, an additional cohort should be enrolled at the 
same dose level.  
Dose escalation for schedule 2 may continue until: 
• The trial is stopped f or safety OR  
• The maximum sample size of 15 subjects is reached OR  
• The maximum sample size has not been reached but 12 subjects have been enrolled at the 
current dose level OR  
• The Sponsor , in consultation with the SMC , decides to stop enrollment in schedule 2 early 
(based on safety.) and resume enrollment in s chedule 1 or begin enrollment in dose 
expansion*

sufficient safety follow -up completed to confirm safety and tolerability (as determined by the 
SMC ) before a decision can be made to begin dose expansion early.  
NOTE:  The maximum sample size of 15 may be revised if additional dose levels are evaluated or 
if more additional subjects (i.e., subjects available for dosing beyond the number required in a cohort) are enrolled than anticipated. The Sponsor, in consultation with the SMC , may also elect 
to add subjects if additional safety data are needed to select a dose and schedule for the expansion

Creatinine clearance (mL/min)1 =  Q x (140 – age [yr]) x ideal body weight [kg]2 
     72 x serum creatinine [mg/dL] 
Q = 0.85 for females  
Q = 1.0 for males  
 
OR 
 
Creatinine clearance (mL/min)2 =  K x (140 – age [yr]) x ideal body weight [kg]1 
     serum creatinine [ µmol /L] 
K = 1.0 for females  
K = 1.23 for males  
 
1. Creatinine clearance has a maximum value of 125 mL/min.  
2. Use ideal body weight (IBW) if body weight > 30% of IBW. Otherwise, use bodyweight  
 
 
Calculation of IBW using the Devine Formula [Devine, 1974]:  
 Males = 50.0 kg + (2.3 x each inch over 5 ft) or 50.0 kg + (0.906 kg x each cm over 152.4 cm)  
Females = 45.5 kg + (2.3 x each inch over 5 ft) or 45.5 kg + (0.906 kg x each cm over 152.4 cm)  
 Example:  
Male, actual body weight = 90.0 kg; height = 68 inches; IBW = 50 + (2.3) (68 – 60) = 68.4 kg  
This subject’s a ctual body weight is >30% over IBW. Therefore, in this case, the subject’s IBW of 68.4 kg should 
be used in calculating the estimated creatinine clearance

161 16.6 RECIST  1.1 and iRECIST Criteria 
16.6.1 RECIST 1.1 Criteria  
Measurable disease:   Measurable tumor lesions (nodal, subcutaneous, lung parenchyma, solid 
organ metastases) are defined as those that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension 
(longest diameter to be recorded) as ≥10 millimeter ( mm) with CT scan  or clinical examination.   
Bone lesions are considered measurable only if assessed by CT scan and have an identifiable soft 
tissue  component that meets these requirements (soft tissue component ≥10 mm by CT scan). 
Malignant lymph nodes must be ≥15 mm in the short axis to be considered measurable; only the 
short axis will be measured  and followed. All tumor measurements must be recorded in m m (or 
decimal fractions of  cm) . Previously irradiated lesions are not considered measurable unless 
progression has been documented in the lesion. 
Malignant lymph nodes:  pathological nodes must meet the criterion of a short axis of ≥15 mm by 
CT scan and only the short  axis of these nodes will contribute to the baseline sum. All other 
pathological nodes (those with short axis  ≥10 mm but <15 mm) should be considered non- target 
lesions. Nodes that have a short axis <10 mm are  considered non- pathological and should not be 
recorded or followed. 
Non-measurable disease:   All other lesions (or sites of disease), including small lesions (longest 
diameter <10 mm [<1 cm] or pathological lymph nodes with ≥10 to <15 mm [≥1 to <1.5 cm] short 
axis), are considered non- measurable disease.  Bone lesions without a measurable soft tissue 
component , leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural/pericardial effusions, lymphangitis cutis, 
inflammatory breast disease, lymphangitic involvement of lung or skin, and abdominal masses followed by clinical exam a re all non- measurable.   Lesions in previously irradiated areas are non-
measurable, unless progression has been demonstrated. 
Note:  Cystic lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically defined simp le cysts should not be 
considered as malignant lesion s (neither measurable nor non- measurable) since they are, by 
definition, s imple cysts.  
‘Cystic lesions’ thought to represent cystic metastases can be considered as measurable lesions, if 
they meet the definition of measurability described above. However, if non- cystic lesions are 
present in the same participant, these are preferred for selection as target lesions . 
Target lesions:   When more than one measurable tumor lesion is present at baseline all lesions up 
to a maximum of 5 lesions in total (and a maximum of 2 lesions per organ) , representative of all 
involved organs, should be identified as target lesions  and recorded and measured at baseline.  
Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest diameter), be 
representative of all involved organs, but in addition should be those that lend themselves to reproducible repeated measurements.  It may be the case that, on occasion, the largest lesion does not lend itself to reproducible measurement in which circumstance the next largest lesion which 
can be measured reproducibly should be selected.  A sum of the diameters (longest for non-nodal 
lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) for all target lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum diameter s.  If lymph nodes are to be included in the sum, then only the short axis is 
CONFIDENTIAL    SL01 -DEL -101 
Compound: SL-279252  Version no: 07  
162 added into the sum.  At baseline, the sum of the  target lesions (longest diameter of tumor lesions 
plus short axis of lymph nodes: overall maximum of 5) is to be recorded.   
After baseline, a value should be provided on the e CRF for all identified target lesions for each 
assessment,  even if very small. If extremely small and faint lesions cannot be accurately measured 
but are deemed to be present, a default value of 5 mm may be used. If lesions are too small to 
measure and indeed are believed  to be absent, a default value of 0 mm may be used. The baseline 
sum diameters will be used as reference to further characterize any objective tumor regression in the measurable dimension of the disease.  
Non-target lesions:  All non-measurable lesions (or sites of disease) plus any measurable lesions 
over and above those listed as  target lesions are considered  non- target lesions and should also be 
recorded at baseline.  Measurements of these lesi ons are not required, but the presence, absence, 
or in rare cases unequivocal progression of each should be noted throughout follow-up.  
16.6.2 Evaluation of Response  
Complete Response (CR):  Disappearance of target  and non- target  lesions  and normalization of 
tumor markers .  Pathological lymph nodes must have short axis measures  <10 mm ( Note: continue 
to record the measurement even if <10 mm and considered CR ).  Residual lesions (other than 
nodes <10 mm) thought to be non- malignant should be further investigated (by cytology, 
specialized imaging or other techniques as appropriate for individual cases) before CR can be 
accepted.  Response should be confirmed in a subsequent scan ≥4 weeks after the scan showing CR. 
Partial Response (PR):   At least a 30% decrease in t he sum of the measures (longest diameters 
for tumor lesions and short axis measure for nodes) of  target lesions, taking as reference the 
baseline sum of diameters.   Non -target lesions must be non- progressive disease.  Response should 
be confirmed in a subs equent scan ≥4 weeks after the scan showing PR. 
Stable Disease (SD):   Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to 
qualify for progressive disease, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study.   
Documented at least once ≥4 w eeks from baseline. 
Progressive Disease (PD):   At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of measured lesions 
taking as references the smallest sum of diameters recorded on study (including baseline) AND an absolute increase of ≥5 mm. Appearance of new lesions will also constitute progressive disease (including lesions in previously unassessed areas). In exceptional circumstances, unequivocal progression of non- target disease may be accepted as evidence of disease progressi on, where the 
overall tumor burden has increased sufficiently to merit discontinuation of treatment or where the tumor burden appears to have increased by at least 73% in volume. Modest increases in the size of one or more non- target lesions are NOT consid ered unequivocal progression. If the evidence of 
progressive disease is equivocal (target or non- target), treatment may continue until the next 
assessment, but if confirmed, the earlier date must be used.

163 16.6.3 iRECIST 1.1 Criteria  
When using iRECIST, the defini tions of measurable and non- measurable lesions still follow  
RECIST 1.1. The principles used to establish an objective tumor response when using iRECIST 
are largely unchanged from  RECIST 1.1, however, responses assigned using iRECIST have a 
prefix of “i” (e .g., “immune” complete response [iCR]) to differentiate them from responses 
assigned using RECIST 1.1. 
The major change is the concept of resetting the bar if RECIST 1.1 progression is followed at the 
next assessment by tumor shrinkage. This adaptation accounts for instances where an increase in 
tumor burden, or the appearance of new lesions, does not reflect true tumor progression. Therefore, 
iRECIST requires confirmation of progression.  
Confirming Progression : iRECIST requires the confirmation of progression and uses the terms 
iUPD (unconfirmed progression) and iCPD (confirmed progression). Confirmatory scans should 
be performed at  least 4 weeks after iUPD.   iCPD is confirmed if further increase in tumor burden, 
compared to the last assessment, is seen as  evidenced by one or more of the following criteria : 
• Continued increase in tumor burden (from iUPD) where RECIST  1.1 definitions of 
progression had been met (from nadir) in target, non- target disease or new lesions.  
o Progression in target disease worsens with an increase of at least 5 mm in the 
absolute value of the sum 
o Continued unequivocal progression in non -target disease with an increase in tu mor 
burden 
o Increase in size of previously identified new lesion (s) (an increase of at least 5 mm in the  absolute value of the sum of those considered to be target new lesions) or 
additional new lesions 
 
• RECIST 1.1 criteria are met in lesions types (target or non- target or new lesions) where  
progression was not previously identified, including the appearance of additional new lesions. 
 
• If iUPD is not confirmed at the next assessment, then the appropriate response will be assigned (iUPD if  the criteria are still met, but no worsening, or iSD, iPR or iCR if those 
criteria are met compared to  baseline).  
  New Lesions:   New lesions should be assessed and measured as they appear using RECIST 1.1 
criteria (maxim um of 5 lesions, no more than 2 per site, at least 10 mm in long axis (or 15 mm in 
short axis for nodal lesions)  and recorded as New Lesions -Target (NLT) and New Lesion -Non-
Target (NLNT) to allow clear differentiation from baseline target and non -target lesions.  
 New lesions may either meet the criteria of NLT or NLNT to drive iUPD (or iCPD). However, the measurements of target lesions should NOT be included in the sum of measures of original target lesions identified at baseline. Rather, these measurements will be collected on a separate table in the eCRF .

164 Progressive disease is confirmed in the New Lesion category if the next imaging assessment, 
conducted at least 4 weeks (but not more than 8 weeks) after iUPD confirms further progression 
from iUPD with  either an increase of at least 5 mm in the absolute value of the sum of NLT OR 
an increase (but not necessarily unequivocal increase) in the size of NLNT lesions OR the appearance of additional new lesions.  iRECIST Time Point Response Table

166 16.7 RECIL  
Target Lesions:  Target lesions should be selected from those with the largest size that can be 
reproducibly measured and should preferably represent multiple sites or organs. In most cases, 
lymph nodes can be considered target lesions if the lymph node’s longest diameter is ≥ 15 mm.   
Extra -nodal lesions are selected as target lesions if they have a soft tissue component, based on 
their size, and the ease of reproducibility of repeated measurements, with a minimum measurement of the longest diameter of ≥ 15 mm . 
Non-target Lesions:   All other lesions including measurable lesions over and above the 3 target 
lesions should be identified as non- target lesions and should be recorded at baseline without the 
need to measure them.  In certain anatomical sites (inguinal, axillary, and portocaval), normal 
lymph nodes may exist in a narrow, elongated form, and such nodes should not be sel ected as 
target lesions if alternatives are available.   Non -target lesions should be reported as present, absent, 
or unequivocal progression. 
Bone marrow:  A bone marrow biopsy would be performed as a part of staging.  In participants 
with positive FDG -PET uptake may obviate the need for a bone marrow biopsy.  Participants with 
HL without FDG update in the bone marrow or presence of B -symptoms do not need a bone 
marrow biopsy at baseline, as bone marrow biopsy in this situation is extremely unlikely to modi fy 
stage.  
16.7.1 Evaluation of Response  
Complete Response:   Complete disappearance of all target lesions by CT scan with complete 
normalization of FDG -PET (Deauville score 1 –3 [see Appendix Section 16.4]) uptake in all areas 
and bone marrow biopsy negativity (if it was positive or unknown at baseline).  If pretreatment 
PET scan was negative, all lymph nodes that measure ≥ 15 mm  in the long axis should regress to 
< 10 mm.  CR is also defined as achievement of a PR by CT scan (> 30% decrease in sum of 
longest diameters of target lesions ) plus normalization of F DG-PET in FDG -avid lymphoma.   
Because many novel agents may alter glucose uptake and/or metabolism, normalizing FDG -PET 
imaging alone is not sufficient by itself to determine CR status unless accompanied with a significant decrease (>30%) decrease in the sum of diameters.  Accordingly, a reduction in the sum of diameters by ≤30% with normalization of FDG -PET uptake should not be considered a CR 
unless documented by a negative tissue biopsy.   
In cases where pretreatment baseline tumor burden is low, with only a few lesions measuring 
around 2 cm in longest diameter, treatment effect may shrink the long axis of a target lymph node to normal values of <10 mm.  However, even though the lymph node is now within normal size 
range, consistent with CR, the percentage of diameter reduction may be <30% (less than PR).   In 
these cases, a normalized diameter of “0 or resolved” shoul d be used to calculate the sum of 
diameter, and therefore ensuring accurate response designation. 
Partial Response:   A ≥ 30% decrease in the sum of longest diameters of target lesions but not a 
CR, positive FDG -PET (Deauville score 4 –5), any bone marrow involvement, no new lesions.  If 
one or more target lesions grew but the sum of the diameters remains ≤30% of the baseline 
measurement, and no new lesions appear, the response should be designated a PR.    
CONFIDENTIAL    SL01 -DEL -101 
Compound: SL-279252  Version no: 07  
167 Minor Response:  ≥ 10% decrease in the sum o f longest diameters of target lesions but not a partial 
response, a ny FDG -PET findings, any bone marrow involvement, no new lesions. 
Stable Disease:  < 10% decrease or ≤ 20% increase in  the sum of longest diameters of target 
lesions, any FDG-PET findings, any bone marrow involvement, no new lesions. 
Progressive Disease:  > 20% increase in the sum of longest diameter of target lesions ; for small 
lymph nodes of < 15 mm posttherapy, minimum absolute increase of 5 mm and long diameter 
> 15 mm; a ppearance of new l esion ; any FDG- PET finding; a ny bone marrow involvement ; new 
or no new lesions. 
Progressive Disease After Initial Response:   after initial response, and in the absence of 
appearance of new lesions, progressive disease is defined as an increase of the nadir  sum of 
diameters by > 20%. Response Assessment in Participant s Receiving Immune- Modulating Agents , Including 
Checkpoint Inhibitors :  to account for potential ‘pseudoprogression,’ immune -related response 
criteria should be used, requiring confirmation of progressive disease on two consecutive scans at 
least 4 weeks apart and inclusion of new lesion measurements in the total tumor burden. 
Appearance of New Extranodal Lesion : A minimum of 1 cm in largest diameter of new 
extranodal lesions is required to confirm progressive disease. New smaller but suspicious lesions 
should be designated as equivocal; if later confirmed (by CT or biopsy) as due to lymphoma, the documented date of disease progression should be the date of identification as equivocal. 
Disseminate d Disease : The status of nontarget lesions should be accounted for  before formulating 
the final response status. The International Working Group statement provides a recommended 
approach to response designation involving the best response of target and nontarget lesions.

Issue #5 -Modified dose escalation between second and third dose levels to half -log increment  
Protocol Synopsis 
• Planned sample size section: changed sample size to approximately 42 to 87 subjects  
• Dose escalation scheme section: in table changed dose level 3 to 0.003 mg/kg, In addition, footnote 
c of table notes that half -log incremental increases will not be exceeded after dose level 2, and

on schedule 2 as possibility if safety allows.  
Section 3.1.1 
Revised wording to reflect changes in sample size estimates to evaluate up to 10 or more dose levels.  The maximum planned sample size for dose es calation is 42 subjects if only Schedule 1 is 
evaluated and, if Schedules 1 and 2 are evaluated in dose escalation, the maximum planned sample 
size is 57.  Overall, the total sample size estimate for this study is 72 subjects assuming only 
Schedule 1 is ev aluated in dose escalation and 87 subjects if Schedules 1 and 2 are fully evaluated.

Synopsis  Revised eligibility criteria to align with text changes made in the main body of the protocol as 
 described below.  
 
Issue #1  – Subjects with DLBCL are no longer eligible for study participation.  
• Section 1.3 revised text  
o This first -in-human Phase  1 study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK, anti -tumor and 
pharmacodynamic effects of SL -279252 to identify the dose and schedule i.e., 
recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) for future development. The trial will enroll patients with tumor types that have demonstrated benefit from anti -PD1/L1 inhibitor therapy i.e., 
melanoma, non- small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), urothelial cancer, head and neck 
squamous cell carcinoma  (HNSCC), squamous cell cervical cancer, gastric or gastro -
esophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma of the anal canal (SCCA), squamous cell carcinoma of the skin (Sk in-SCC), renal cell cancer (RCC), 
Hodgkin’s lymphoma (HL), diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and microsatellite 
instability high (MSI -H) or mismatch repair deficient (MMRD) solid tumors excluding 
central nervous system (CNS) malignancies.  
• Section 3.1 revised text 
o Subjects with any of the following malignancies (including specific subtypes) may be enrolled in Dose Escalation: melanoma, NSCLC (squamous cell or adenocarcinoma or 
adeno- squamous), urothelial cancer, HNSCC, squamous cell cervical cancer,  gastric or 
GEJ adenocarcinoma, SCCA, Skin- SCC, RCC, HL,  DLBCL,  MSI-H or MMRD solid 
tumors excluding CNS malignancies. The tumor types for dose expansion (up to 4 
histologies) will be determined after review of data collected during dose escalation, and 
will be selected from the dose escalation list of malignancies.

o Bone marrow : Participants with DLBCL with a negative FDG PET uptake in the bone 
marrow, does not rule out bone marrow involvement, especially discordant histology.  A 
bone marrow biopsy would be performed as a part of staging.  In participants  with positive 
FDG- PET uptake may obviate the need for a bone marrow biopsy.  Participants with HL 
without FDG update in the bone marrow or presence of B -symptoms do not need a bone 
marrow biopsy at baseline, as bone marrow biopsy in this situation is extr emely unlikely 
to modify stage.

after the last dose of IP. After a subject is discontinued from SL -279252 due to progressive disease 
or for other reasons, any ongoing AE should be followed until resolution (or return to baseline) 
and documented in the eCRF. If another anti -cancer agent is started, only SAEs and irAEs that 
occur prior to starting the new anticancer therapy within 30 days from last dose of SL -279252  
should be recorded.  In the event of a continuing SAE or a non- serious irAE, the subject will be 
asked to return for follow -up until the SAE or irAE has resolved or is deemed to be continuing 
indefinitely. AEs will be characterized per NCI -CTCAE criteria v5.0 and events recorded in the 
eCRF.

PK tables were changed as outlined below.  
• Supplementary PK Table 8 in Section 6.1.1, Table 12 in Section 6.1.2, Table 15 in Section 6.3.1  
and Table 18  in Section 6.4.1 
CONFIDENTIAL    SL01 -DEL -101 
Compound: SL-279252  Version no: 07  
186 • Text was added to footnote # 4 in Table 15  in Section  6.3.1  and in Table 18  in Section 6.4.1  stating: 
C3/D1 and C4/D1 collect a predose sample for PK/ADA and then  EOI, and 6 hr post EOI sample 
for PK.  
• Text was updated in Section 6.7.1 as shown below. 
Intensive serial PK samples will be collected for all subjects enrolled in dose escalation cohorts. 
In the first cycle starting on Day 1, samples will be collected pre- dose, at  the EOI, and 0.5, 1, 1.5, 
2, 3, 4, 6, 8 and 24 hours post EOI. Additional PK samples will be collected at 48, 72, and 96 hours post EOI. Actual dose administration and PK sampling times will be documented in the subject’s medical record. Sample collection  out to 96 hours post EOI may be truncated during dose finding 
based on emerging data (e.g., lower doses may require collection of PKs only through the 48-hour time point following the first infusion). Subsequently, pre -dose, EOI, 2- hour, 6-hour and 24-hour 
post EOI samples will be obtained on C1D15/D16 and C2D1/D2. On C3/D1 and C4/D1 , a pre -
dose, EOI, and 6- hour post EOI sample will be collected. Beyond cycle 43, only pre -dose samples 
will be collected for ADA and PK analyses on D1 of C4,  C7, C10, C13 and C25.  A final PK/ADA 
sample should be collected within 7 – 30 days after permanently stopping treatment with SL -
279252. 
• Text was updated in Section 6.7.2  
Sparse PK samples will be collected for all subjects enrolled in Expansion Cohorts. Actual dose administration and PK sampling times will be documented in the subject’s medical record. A sample will be collected pre-dose, at the EOI and then 2 and 6 hours after the in fusion on C1/D1. 
A 24 -hour post EOI sample will be collected on Day 2 of the first cycle (C1/D2). Subsequently, 
pre-dose, EOI, 2- hour, 6- hour, and 24- hour post EOI samples will be obtained on C1D15/D16 and 
C2D1/D2. A predose, EOI and 6- hour post EOI sample will be collected on C3/D1 and cycle 
4/D1 . Beyond cycle 43, only pre- dose samples will be collected for ADA and PK analyses on D1 
of C4, C7, C10, C13 and C25. A final PK/ADA sample should be collected within 7 – 30 days 
after permanently stopping treatmen t with SL -79252. 
• Blood Requirements provided in Appendix 16.8 were updated to include additional PK samples 
added for collection on C4D1  
7) Revised wording in Section  7 Safety Assessments as shown below  
• Subjects will be followed continuously for AEs starting when a subject has signed the ICF, throughout the course of treatment and for 90 days after the last dose of IP. After a subject is 
discontinued from SL -279252 due to progressive disease or for other reasons, any ongoing AEs 
should be followed until resolution (or return to baseline) and documented in the eCRF. If anothe r 
anti-cancer agent is started within 90 days after the last dose of SL-279252, only SAEs and ir AEs 
that occur prior to starting the new anticancer therapy  within 30 days from last dose of SL 279252 
should be recorded. All observed or volunteered AEs (seri ous or non- serious) and abnormal 
laboratory test findings, if applicable, whether suspected to have a causal relationship to the SL -
279252 or not will be recorded in the subject medical record and in the eCRF.  AEs will be graded 
according to NCI -CTCAE v5.0.  For all AEs, sufficient information will be pursued and/or 
obtained to perm it an adequate determination of seriousness and outcome of the event (i.e., 
whether it should be classified as a SAE or not) and an assessment of the causal relatio nship 
between the AE and SL -279252.  AEs will be followed until resolution (or return to baseline) or 
stabilization.  Refer to Section 7.5 for docum entation and reporting of AEs.  
o Revise d text in Section  7.5 on Reporting Procedure s for AE s in table as shown below  to 
align with wording in Section 7. 
Event  Reporting Procedures  
Adverse Event  Subjects will be followed continuously for AEs during the study and for 90 days after the last 
dose of IP. After a subject is discontinued from SL- 279252 due to progressive disease or for 
other reasons, any ongoing AE should be followed until resolution (o r return to baseline) and 
CONFIDENTIAL    SL01 -DEL -101 
Compound: SL-279252  Version no: 07  
187 Event  Reporting Procedures  
documented in the eCRF, regardless of whether the event(s) is attributed to trial medication. If 
another anti -cancer agent is started, only SAEs and AEs that occur prior to starting the new 
anticancer therapy  within 30 days from last dose of SL 279252 should be recorded. The 
following information will be recorded: description, date of onset and end date, severity, 
assessment of relatedness to trial medication, and action taken.  Follow -up information should 
be provided as necessary.  AEs will be followed either until resolution, or the event is considered stable.  
 It will be left to the Investigator’s clinical judgment to decide whether an AE is of sufficient 
severity to require the subject’s removal from treatment.  A subject may also voluntarily 
withdraw from treatment due to what he or she perceives as an intolerable AE.  If either of these occurs, the subject must undergo an end of trial assessment and be given appropriate care under medical supervision until symptoms cease, or the condition becomes stable . 
 
 
8) Other minor editorial changes made are noted below (new text added is italicized).  
• Duration of Treatment Section 3.11 new text (in italics) added to the last paragraph:  Impact of ADA 
on clinical efficacy (non- response or loss of response to the IP) and safety (product specific 
immunogenicity risk) will be evaluated  and reported on an on- going basis once a validated ADA 
assay becomes available.  If a subject develops ADA,  the Sponsor and investigator may take into 
consideration these factors in assessing the duration of the therapy.  
• Assessment of Severity for AEs is now Section  7.1 moved up and no longer under Section entitled 
Classification of Adverse Event in Section 7.3  (was Section 7.2 in previous versions of protocol) 
o Section 7 subheadings renumbered to accommodate moving Assessment of Severity  
Section up and designating it as Section 7.1 in this version of the protocol. 
• Removed text from S ection 7.4 as shown as shown below. 
o Changes in the severity of an AE will be documented to allow an assessment of the duration 
of the event at each l evel of severity.  The highest grade in severity for each  AE will be 
documented. AEs characterized as intermittent require documentation of onset and 
duration of each episode.

 Revised exclusion criterion #2 to align with text changes made in main body of the protocol as 
described below 
 
1) Institute requirement that eligible subjects have tumors with PD -L1 expression ≥1%  according to tumor 
TPS or CPS at baseline.  
• Section 1.3  Rationale; new text (italics) added as shown below: 
This first -in-human Phase 1 study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK, anti -tumor and 
pharmacodynamic effects of SL -279252 to identify the dose and schedule i.e., recommended Phase 
2 dose (RP2D) for future development. The trial will enroll patients with tumor types that have 
demonstrated benefit from anti -PD1/L1 inhibitor therapy i.e., melanoma, non- small cell lung 
cancer (NSCLC), urothelial cancer, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma  (HNSCC), squamous 
cell cervical cancer, gastric or gastro -esophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma, squamous cell 
carcinoma of the anal canal (SCCA), squamous cell carcinoma of the skin (Skin- SCC), renal cell 
cancer (RCC), Hodgkin’s lymphoma (HL), and microsatellite instability high (MSI -H) or mismatch 
repair deficient (MMRD) solid tumors excluding central nervous system (CNS) malignancies. Given that SL -279252 likely requires binding of PD -L1 to mediate activity within the tumor, the 
study was amended to require eligible subjects to have tumors with PD -L1 expression ≥1% by 
tumor proportion score (TPS) or combined proportion score (CPS) at baseline . 
• Section 4.2  Inclusion Criteria; new text (italics) added as criteria #3 shown below:  
3. Eligible subjects must have tumors expressing PD -L1  ≥1%  by tumor proportion score (TPS) 
or combined proportion score (CPS) as determined by a local laboratory. 
• This criteri a does not apply to subjects with a diagnosis of melanoma, renal cell 
carcinoma, Hodgkin’s lymphoma and microsatell ite instability high (MSI -H) or mismatch 
repair deficient (MMRD) solid tumors.  
CONFIDENTIAL    SL01 -DEL -101 
Compound: SL-279252  Version no: 07  
191 • SOA tables 6.1, 6.2, 6.3 and 6.4 new text (italics) added to footnote a  in all of these tables  in 
reference to Screening  as shown: 
Subjects will be enrolled based on local PD -L1 tumor testing results. Any PD -L1 tumor testing 
results prior to enrollment are acceptable.  
 
2) Subjects with uveal or ocular  melanoma are ineligible for participation.  
• Section  4.2 Inclusion Criterion #2; new text (italics) added as shown below:  
2. Subject has a histologically confirmed diagnosis of one of the following unresectable locally 
advanced or metastatic malignancies: melanoma, non -small cell lung cancer (squamous, adeno, 
or adeno- squamous), urothelial cancer, squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, 
squamous cell cervical cancer, gastric or gastro -esophageal junction adenocarcinoma, 
squamous cell carcinoma of the anal canal, squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, renal cell cancer, Hodgkin’s lymphoma, and microsatellite instability high (MSI -H) or mismatch repa ir 
deficient (MMRD) solid tumors excluding CNS malignancies. MSI and MMRD testing results 
as per institution is acceptable.    
 • Head and neck cancers: Subjects must have primary tumor locations in the oropharynx, 
oral cavity, hypopharynx, or larynx. Primary tumor sites of nasopharynx,  maxillary sinus, paranasal, and unknown primary are excluded. 
• Non-small cell lung cancers: Subjects with a known EGFR sensitizing (activating) 
mutation or an ALK fusion are excluded.  
• Melanoma: Subjects with a diagnosis of uveal or ocular melanoma are excluded.  
 
• Section  4.3 Exclusion Criterion #2; text deleted as shown:  
2. Refractory to last PD -1/L1 inhibitor -based therapy which is defined as disease progression 
within 3 months of treatment initiation.  
• Subjects must have had clinical benefit (stable disease or response) to last PD -1/L1 
inhibitor- based therapy for at least  three months to be eligible.  
Note : Exclusion criterion #2 and the sub bullet above do not apply to subjects with uveal 
melanoma.  
 
3) Removed reference to 1 mL fill size of drug product to allow for larger fill volume.  
• Section 5.1  Investigational Product Description; edited text as below:  
Unit dose strength(s)/Dose Level(s):  
20 mg/mL; 1.0 mL  in a 10 mL sized  glass  vial (Refer to Section 3.2.4  for dose levels) . Refer to the 
Study Pharmacy Manual (SPM) for further description of drug product.   
• Section 5.2.1 Preparation  
SL-279252 s olution for infusion, 20 mg/mL is supplied as a frozen liquid.  Before use, thaw each vial 
of SL- 279252 for infusion (20 mg/mL , 1mL ) overnight under refrigerated conditions protected 
from light  or at room temperature until completely thawed to a clear solution over 1 hour.  
  
4) Minor editorial changes were made to clarify study conduct procedures during dose escalation and 
requirements for collection of ad hoc labs if IRR and/or CRS occur. 
• New tex t (in italics) added to the 1st paragraph in Section 3.1 Description of the Study Design as 
shown below: 
CONFIDENTIAL    SL01 -DEL -101

192 This is a Phase 1 first in human, open label, multi- center, dose escalation and dose expansion study 
to evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK, anti -tumor activity and pharmacodynamic effects of SL -
279252 in subjects with selected locally advanced or metast atic malignancies. The tumor types 
selected have been reported in the literature to be responsive to PD -1/L1 inhibitors. Subjects with 
any of the following malignancies (including specific subtypes) may be enrolled in Dose 
Escalation: melanoma, NSCLC (squamous cell or adenocarcinoma or adeno -squamous), urothelial 
cancer, HNSCC, squamous cell cervical cancer, gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma, SCCA, Skin -SCC, 
RCC, HL, MSI -H or MMRD solid tumors excluding CNS malignancies. A subset of one or more 
selected tumor t ype(s) from the list of eligible histologies may be identified for enrollment in dose 
escalation . The tumor types for dose expansion will be determined after review of data collected 
during dose escalation, and will be selected from the dose escalation lis t of malignancies.  
• Minor editorial change made to 1st  sentence in Section  6.6.6.1 as shown: 
Ad hoc labs should be collected as noted if IRR and/or CRS events or an immune related adverse 
event (irAE) occur. The samples to be collected are provided below.

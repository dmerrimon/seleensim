Investigational Product  
Amgen Investigational Produ ct Dosage and Administration:  Cinacalcet is a calcimime tic 
agent  which is synthesized as a hydrochloride  salt.  Cinacalcet will be provided as 5 mg capsules 
for sprinkling or as film coated tablets for swallowing in a strength of 30 mg. 
The capsules provided must not be swallowed whole and must be opened and either sprinkled on 
soft food or suspended into a sucrose syrup to create a liquid  suspension for administration. 
The protocol-specified doses (PSD) for use in this study are:  1, 2.5, 5, 7.5, 10, 15, 30, 60, 90, 
120, and 180 mg. 
Subje cts will receive cinacalcet daily and all doses should be administered with food or shortly 
after a meal  at the same time each day.  On study visit days where a blood  sample is to be 
drawn, cinacalcet should not be admin istered until after the blood  sample has been obtained. 
Non-investigational Product 
Non-Amgen Non-investigational Product Dosage and Administration:  All subjects will 
receive standard of care treatment  including vitamin  D sterols, calcium supplementation, and 
phosphate binders at the discretion of the investigator. 
Procedu res:  Informed  consent, and assent where applicable, for this study should be presented 
during the Studies 20130356 or 20110100.  The informed consent, including assent as

appropriate, will be obtained prior to execution of any study procedures for this extension study. 
Where the Screening and day 1 assessments for Study 20140159 overlap with visits in 
the 20130356 or 20110100 studies, these will be performed on ce at the site and applied to both 
study visits to minimize duplicate study assessments, eg, 2 0130356 end of investigational 
product (EOIP)  and 20140159 Screening. The subject visits and assessments for this study will 
occur from baseline through to the end of study.  Assessments during this study will include: 
• collection of blood samples for the evaluation of blood chemistry, hematology, calcium, 
iPTH, and bone biomarkers 
• physical assessments including vital signs (ie, blood pressure, hea rt rate) 
• 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) at baseline and week  32 (if the subject ends the study 
prior to week 32, the 12-lead ECG will be performed at the  last study visit) 
• assessments for symptoms of hypocalcemia 
• recording of adverse events, concomitant medication s, and  IP compliance 
 
Subjects from Study 20130356:  Subjects who complete the 20-week treatment pe riod in 
study 20130356 or are still on study at the time of Study 20130356 termination, will be eligible to 
receive cinacalcet treatment in the current study. 
• Subjects from the SOC group in 20130356:  After confirming eligibility, subjects in the 
20130356 SOC group will receive the initial dose of cinacalcet based on the subject’s dry 
weight at day 1 in Study 20140159, 0.20 mg/kg/day, rounded down to the nearest PSD. 
Subjects from the 2 0130356 SOC group will follow the same cinacalcet titration schedule 
as subjects who received cinacalcet in Study 20130356. 
• Subjects from the cinacalcet group in 20130356:  After confirming eligibility, subjects 
from the cinacalcet group will continue to receive cinacalcet at the same dose as EOIP 
visit if there are ≤ 14 days between the last dose of cinacalcet treatment in 
Study 20130356 and d ay 1 of Study 20140159.  If the cinacalcet dose has been withheld 
or missed for > 14 days at the time of day 1 of Study 20140159, subjects will receive the 
initial dose of cinacalcet based on  the subject’s dry weight at time of enrollment to  
20140159.  Subjects in this group will be eligible to receive dose titrations during the 
extension study if the maximum dose of 2.5 mg/kg (based on  20140159 day 1 dry 
weight), not exceeding 180 mg, has not b een reached and they meet the titration criteria 
defined in Section 6. 
 
Subjects from Study 20110100:  Subjects who complete the week  26 End of  Study visit or are 
still on study at the time of Study 20110100 termination, will be eligible to receive cinacalcet 
treatment in the current study.  After confirming eligibility, subjects will continue to receive 
cinacalcet at the same dose as EOIP visit if there are ≤ 14 days between the last dose of 
cinacalcet treatment in Study 20110100 and day 1 of Study 20140159.  If the cinacalcet dose has 
been  withheld or missed for > 14 days at the time of day 1 of Study 20140159, subjects will 
receive the initial dose of cinacalcet based on the subject’s dry weight at time of enrollment to  
20140159 and age at time of enrollment to  20110100, 0.20 mg/kg/day, rounded down to the 
nearest PSD.  Subjects will follow the  dose adjustments outlined in Section 6.2.3.1.2.  Subjects in 
this group will be eligible to receive dose titrations during the  extension study if the maximum 
dose of 2.5 mg/kg (based on 20140159 day 1 dry weight), not exceeding 60 mg, has not been 
reached and they meet the  titration criteria defined in Section 6. 
During the 20140159 study: 
Weekly monitoring of ionized calcium will be required for all subjects through the end of  the 
treatment pe riod, week  28. 
Cinacalcet doses will be calculated by the site staff and confirmed by the interactive voice 
response/interactive web response (IVR/IWR) system following the titration tables in Section 6. 
The titration tables are based on cCa and iPTH values from the central laboratory collected one 
week  before dose titration.  Final dose assignment w ill be based on the ionized calcium obtained

on the day of titration.  An assessment of symptomatic hypocalcemia will also be performed on 
the day of titration.  Additional  weekly dose adjustments for safety are permitted as described in 
Section 6.2.3.1.  The maximum  dose assigned for all subjects will be 2.5 mg/kg/day (based on 
dry weight at day 1 in Study 20140 159) not to exceed a dose of 180 mg/day for subjects from 
20130356  and 60 mg/day for subjects from 201101 00. 
For all subjects, it is recommend ed that the vitamin  D sterols, calcium supplementation, and 
phosphate binders be administered as appropriate per individual clinical practice.  The use of 
medi cations that may prolong the corrected QT (QTc) interval (eg, onda nsetron, albuterol), 
CYP3A4  inhibitors (eg, erythrom ycin, clarithromycin, ketoconazole, itraconazole), CYP2D6 
substrates (eg, flecainide, propafenone, metoprolol, desipramine, nortriptyline, clomip ramin e), 
and comm ercial cinacalcet during the course of the trial are prohibited while the subject is 
receiving investigational product. 
Serio us adverse events will be collected from the date of the first dose through 30 days following 
the last dose of investigational product.  Adverse events will be collected from the date of the first 
dose through 30 days following the last dose of investigational product. 
For a full list of study procedures, including the timing of each procedure, please refer to 
Section 7 and the Schedule of Assessments (Table 4). 
Statistical Considerations:  There is no formal  statistical testing for this study.  The analysis of 
the primary and secondary endpo ints will be descriptive in nature. 
For categorical variabl es, the number and percentage of subjects in each category will be 
reported.  Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize data for continuous variab les (including 
n, mean,  standard deviation (SD) or standard error (SE), median,  25th (Q1) and 75th (Q3) 
percentiles, minimum  and maximum  values, where applicable).  All summ ary tables  will be 
provided by study treatment group:  Study 20130 356 (SOC,  SOC + cinacalcet) and 
Study 2011 0100 and overall, unless otherwise specified. 
Graphical presentations may be provid ed for selected variabl es. 
All adverse events occurring during the study will be coded using the latest version of the 
MedDRA dictionary  and the subject incidence will be tabula ted.

1. OBJECTIVES 
 
1.1 Prima ry 
 
To characterize the long-term safety  and tolerabi lity of cinacalcet in pedia tric subjects 
with chronic  kidney  disease (CKD)  receiving dialysis. 
 
1.2 Seconda ry 
 
To characterize the long-term effect of cinacalcet in pediatr ic subjects receiving dialysis 
on laborato ry paramete rs associated  with chronic  kidney  disease – mineral  and bone 
disease (CKD -MBD). 
 
1.3 Explorato ry 
 
To characterize the long-term effect of cinacalcet in pediatr ic subjects on linear  and 
pubertal  growth. 
 
2. BACKGROUND  AND  RATIONALE 
 
2.1 Seconda ry Hyperpara thyroidism  in Pediatric  Subjects  
 
Secondary  hyperparath yroidism (SHPT)  develops relati vely early  in the course of CKD, 
worsens with declining  renal  function, and is common ly associated  with serious 
compli cations both in adults and in children  on dialysis. CKD  in childre n, as in adults, is 
a devastating  illness. In children  with CKD,  grow th retardati on is a prominent  finding  and 
 
SHPT  is an important  contributor  to this disorder  (Kuizon et al, 1999 ). 
 
In both the United  States  (US)  and Europe,  there  are few children  with CKD  on dialysis 
compared  with the adult  population.  The rate of Stage  5 CKD in children  was estimated 
at 15.2 per million  popu lation  in the US over the 2007 -2011  time period.  This correla tes 
with 6800  incident  children with Stage  5 CKD  reported  during  this same time period 
(USRDS, 2013). Data  from the publi shed 2011  European  Renal  Association -European 
Dialysis and Tran splant  Association (ERA -EDTA) registry, show 2115  prevalent  pediatric 
patients  with Stage  5 CKD receiving maintenan ce dialysis. Of these, 207 patients  were 
0 to 4, 323 patients  were  5 to 9, 566 patients  were 10 to 14, and 1019  patients were  
 
15 to 19 years of age. 
 
Children  on dialysis experien ce similar laborato ry disturban ces with regards to 
parath yroid hormone  (PTH), serum  calcium (Ca) and phosphorous  as adults  
(Bacchetta  et al, 2012 ). Traditional  therapies  for SHPT  (eg, vitamin D sterols) are widely 
used in the pediatric  dialysis popula tion, but are sometimes  insufficient to manage  SHPT 
due to their potential  to increase serum calcium and phosphorus.

A survey conducted among  18 sites belonging  to North  American Pediatric Renal  Trials 
and Collab orative Services (NAPR TCS) (NAPRTCS,  unpubli shed data), included  data 
from 320 pediatric  hemodial ysis (HD) and peritoneal dialysis (PD)  patient s, between  the 
ages  of 2 to less than 18. The results show that overall, 49% of the pediatric dialysis 
population  has intact parathyroid hormone  (iPTH) levels above 300 pg/mL (31.8  pmol/L), 
the upper  limit recommended  by the NKF-K/DOQI™  guidelines for all pediatric  age 
groups  (NKF -KDOQI™,  2005).  
 
Publi shed pediatric  CKD -MBD guidelines  markedly differ  with respect to the 
recommen ded PTH target  range s. For children  with stage 5 CKD,  the guidelines 
recommend  targets  in the range  between  120 and 540 pg/mL  (Klaus  et al, 2006; 
NKF KDOQI, 2005;  KDIGO  CKD -MBD Working Group,  2009 ). None  of these 
recommen dations  has been validated  in a large  pediatric  stage 5 CKD  cohort.  
 
2.2 Cinacalcet  Backgrou nd 
 
Cinacalcet is a first-in-class calcimimetic  agent  that acts as an allosteric modulator  of the 
calcium sensing receptor (CaSR)  located on the surface of the parath yroid chief cell, 
increasing the sensitivity of the CaSR to extracellular  calcium. Cina calcet has been 
shown  to be safe and efficacious in simultaneou sly controlling  PTH,  calcium, and 
phosphorus  in the adult  dialysis population.  Cinacalcet was initially appro ved in 2004  by 
the US Food  and Drug  Admini stration  (FDA)  for the treatment  of SHPT  in adult  patients 
with CKD  receiving dialysis. As of 28 February  2014,  cinacalcet is approved for this 
indication  in 67 countrie s. Cinacalcet is not approved for use in pediatric  patients  in any 
countr y. 
 
Refer  to the Cinacalcet HCl Investigator’s  Brochure (IB) for additional  information  related 
to the physical, chemi cal, and pharma ceutical properties  and formulation( s). 
 
2.3 Standard  of Care  Ther apy 
 
Standard  of care (SOC)  in the treatment  of children with CKD-MBD  and SHPT consists 
of vitamin D sterols  (eg, calcitriol, paricalcitol), calcium supplementation,  and phosphate 
binders  (calcium based and non-calcium based). 
 
2.4 Pediatric  Risk Assessment  
 
In the 4 interventional  studies  conducted by Amgen in the pediatric  popu lation  to date, 
 
48 subjects between  1 to 17 years of age have been  exposed to cinacalcet. The overall 
adverse event profile  in children  was similar  to that seen in the adult  population  treated 
with cinacalcet. The most commonly observed adverse events were  nausea, vomiting,

and hypocalcemia.  One fatal adverse event was reported  in a pediatric  subject receiving 
cinacalcet in the double -blind  interventional  study in the presence of severe 
hypocalcemia.  While  the cause of death was multi-factoral,  severe hypocalcemia  was 
observed and a role of cinacalcet could not be excluded.  
 
Additional  risk mitigation  measures implemented  in this trial include:  
 
• collection of real-time ionized calcium measurem ents, 
• weekly monitoring  of calcium, 
• incorporati on of local laboratory  total calcium values  into the dosing schema,  
• subject investigational  product (IP) complian ce measures, 
• dispensing limited  quantities  of IP to minimi ze the potential  for overdosing 
• addition  of exclusionary  electrocardiogram  (ECG) criteria  
 
A dosing strategy,  using a weight -based starting  dose of ≤ 0.2 mg/kg in pediatric 
subjects, which is approximately  50% below  the adult  starting dose, will be emplo yed in 
this study. The dose of cinacalcet will be titrated based on iPTH, corrected calcium 
(cCa) levels, ionized calcium, and subject safety  information.  The maximum dose in this 
study will be 2.5 mg/kg/day  based on day 1 dry weight,  not to exceed a dose of 
 
• 180 mg/day  for subjects from 20130356  
• 60 mg/day  for subjects from 20110100  
 
Serum  calcium will be monitored  throughout  the study. In the event a subject 
experien ces proto col-defined hypocalcemia,  an adverse event deemed  related  to IP or 
other  adverse event that warrants  IP dose withho ld, the dose of cinacalcet will be 
reduced or discontin ued as appro priate.  Vitamin  D sterols, calcium supplementation 
and/or  calcium-based phosphate  binders  can be used to raise serum  calcium levels and 
should  be admini stered  as appropri ate per individual clinic practice. Training and 
informational  tools  will be provided to investigators for dissemination  to care givers and 
subjects regarding  the symptoms and risks of hypocalcemia.  
 
Volumes  of blood  withdrawn  for analysis will be minimi zed as appropria te for this 
pediatric  population  based on dry weight.  
 
2.5 Studies  Eligible  to Roll-over  to 20140159  
 
2.5.1  Amgen  Study 201303 56 
 
Amgen  Study 20130356  is a phase 3 randomi zed, multi center, open -label,  controlled 
study. In Study  20130356,  cinacalcet is being  evaluated  in pediatric  subjects enrolled 
between  the ages  of 6 and < 18 years, with SHPT  and CKD  receiving either

hemodial ysis or periton eal dialysis. Appro ximately 48 subjects are planned to be 
randomi zed into the study to one of two treatme nt arms  in a 1:1 allocation ratio;  daily 
oral admini stration  of cinacalcet in addition  to SOC or SOC only.  Once randomi zed, the 
expected treatment  period  in 20130 356 is 20 weeks with a 4-week  safety follow -up 
period.  Subje cts who are eligible  for and enroll  in the 2014 0159 extension study will do 
so at the completion  of the 20-week  treatment  period  in 20130356  or following 
Study  20130356  termination  and within 7 days of day 1 of 20140159,  unless there  is an 
admini strative delay. The end of study (EOS) procedures  for an individual  subject will 
occur at the same time as the end of investigatio nal produ ct (EOIP)  visit for subjects 
enrolling  in Study  20140159.  The 4-week  safety follow-up period  in 20130356  will not 
apply  for these subjects. 
 
2.5.2  Amgen  Study 201101 00 
 
Amgen  Study 20110100  is a phase 2, multi center, open-label,  single -arm study. In 
Study  20110100  cinacalcet is being evaluated  in pediatric  subjects enrolled between  the 
ages  of 28 days and < 6 years, with SHPT  and CKD  receiving either  hemodial ysis or 
peritoneal  dialysis. The expected treatment  period  in 20110 100 is 24 w eeks of daily oral 
admini stration of cinacalcet in addition to SOC  with a 2-week  safety  follow-up period. 
Subje cts who are eligib le for and enroll in the 20140159  extension study will do so at the 
completion  of the week  26 End of Study  visit or at Study  20110100  termination  and 
within  7 days of day 1 of 20140159  unless there  is an admin istrative delay. For subjects 
enrolled  in the 20140159  extension study at the time of 20110100  study termination,  the 
2-week  safety follow -up period  in 20110100  will not apply  for these subjects and the 
EOS  procedures for an individual  subject will occur at the time as the EOIP  visit for 
subjects enrolling  in Study 20140159.  
 
2.6 Rationale  
 
Cinacalcet has been  shown to be safe and efficacious in treating adult  CKD patients  with 
SHPT  by controlling  iPTH, calcium, and phosphorus. The current  study is an extension 
of Amgen  studies  2013 0356 and 20110100  designed to assess the long-term safety  and 
tolerability  of cinacalcet in pediatric  CKD  subjects. 
 
2.7 Clinical  Hypotheses  
 
A formal  hypothe sis does not apply  for the study. The long-term safety  and tolerabi lity of 
cinacalcet in pediatric  subjects will be characterized in this study.

3. EXPERIMENTAL  PLAN 
 
3.1 Study Design  
 
This is a phase 3, 32-week, multi center, single -arm, extension study designed  to 
characterize the long-term safety  and tolerability  of cinacalcet in pediatr ic subjects. 
Subje cts will remain on cinacalcet treatment  for 28 weeks after enrollment  or until the 
time of renal  transplant  or parath yroide ctomy,  whichever occurs first. The treatment 
period  is followed  by a 4-week  safety follow -up period.  
 
The overall study design is described by a Study Design  and Treatment  Schema  at 
the end of the proto col synopsis section. 
 
The study endpoints  are defined  in Section 10.1.1. 
 
3.1.1  Subjects  From  Study 20130356  
 
Eligible  subjects will complete  the 20-week  treatment  period  in Study  20130356,  or rea ch 
Study  20130356  termination  and either  continue,  restart, or start cinacalcet treatment  in 
this study. Eligible  subjects will not complete  the safety  follow-up period  in Study  
20130356,  beginning the extension study at the 20130356  EOIP  study visit. The EOIP  
visit in Study  20130356  and day 1 in Study 20140159  will be the same visit unless there  
is an admini strative delay.  Eligible  subjects will complete day 1 of 20140159 
assessments (Section 7.1) and confirm eligibility  in the intera ctive voice response (IVR) 
system before  dispensing IP on day 1. 
 
Eligible  subjects from 20130356  who were  randomi zed to the SOC  arm in 
 
Study  20130356  will begin cinacalcet treatment  on day 1 in Study  20140159  if their iPTH 
is ≥ 300 pg/mL  and cCa is ≥ 8.8 mg/dL  during  screening  in Study 20140159.  Eligible 
subjects from the cinacalcet arm in 20130356  will continue cinacalcet treatment  on day 1 
if their iPTH  is ≥ 150 pg/mL  and cCa is ≥ 8.4 mg/dL  during  screening  in Study 20140159. 
If IP has been withheld  or missed for > 14 days at the time of day 1 of Study  20140159, 
the subject will resume dosing at the starting  dose level once all restart criteria  are met. 
 
Cinacalcet dosing will follow the dose titration,  dose withhol d, and restarting rules 
defined  in Section 6.2.3 . 
 
Subje cts will complete  day 1 assessments  (Section 7.1) and confirm  eligibility in IVR 
 
system prior to dispensing IP on day 1. 
 
All subjects from 20130356  will be eligible  to titrate the cinacalcet dose at monthly 
titration  visits (beginning  at week  4) to a maximum dose of 2.5 mg/kg/day  based on the 
subject’s dry weight  at day 1 in Study  20140159,  not to exceed a dose of 180 mg/da y.

dosing instructions outlined  in Section 6.2.3. Eligib le subjects completing  the full 
treatment  period  in Study 20110100  will be screened  during the safety follow -up period 
in Study 20110100  and will be required  to have their 20140159  day 1 visit and 
their 20110 100 week  26 End of Study  visit at the same visit. Eligible  subjects who reach 
Study  20110100  termination  before week  26 will not complete  the safety  follow -up period 
in Study  20110100,  beginning  the 20140159  extension study at the 2011 0100 early 
termination  visit. The early termina tion/EOS  visit in Study  20110100  and day 1 in 
Study  20140159  will be the same visit unless there is an administrative delay.  
 
Subje cts will complete  day 1 assessments  (Section 7.1) and confirm  eligibility in IVR 
 
system before  being  dispensed IP on day 1. 
 
Eligible  subjects will continue  cinacalcet treatment  on day 1 based on their dry weight  at 
the time of enrollment  in 20140159  study if their iPTH is ≥ 150 pg/mL  and cCa 
is ≥ 8.8 mg/dL  (age < 2 years of age) or cCa is ≥ 8.4 mg/dL  (age is ≥ 2 years of age) 
during  screening in Study 20140159.  If IP has been withhe ld or missed for > 14 days at 
the time of day 1 of Study  20140159,  the subject will resume dosing at the starting  dose 
level based on dry weight  at the time of enrollment  once all restart criteria are met. 
Cinacalcet dosing will follow the dose titration,  dose withhol d, and restarting rules 
defined  in Section 6.2.3 .1.2. 
 
All subjects from 20110100  will be eligible  to titrate the cinacalcet dose at monthly 
titration  visits (beginning  at week  4) to a maximum dose of 2.5 mg/kg/day  based on the 
subject’s dry weight  at day 1 in Study  20140159,  not to exceed a dose of 60 mg/da y. 
 
3.2 Number  of Sites  
 
This study will be conducted at approximately  60 sites in North Ameri ca, Europe,  Russia, 
Latin  Ameri ca, and Australia.  
 
3.3 Number  of Subjects

admini stered  until after the blood  sample  has been  obtained.  
 
The proto col-specified doses (PSD)  for use in this study are: 
 
• Subje cts ≥ 6 years of age: 2.5, 5, 10, 15, 30, 60, 90, 120, and 180 mg. Subje cts 
from Study  20130356  will either  continue  to receive cinacalcet at the same dose as 
at the EOIP  visit if ≤ 14 days have passed betw een last dose of cinacalcet treatment 
in Study  20130356  and day 1 of Study  20140159.  If > 14 days have passed, 
subjects will start cinacalcet in Study  20140159  at 0.20 mg/kg/day  based on the 
subject’s dry weight  at Study  20140159  day 1 time point  and age at time of 
enrollment  in Study  20130356,  rounded  down to the lowest PSD.  
− Subje cts from 20130356  may receive capsules for any dose which is an exact 
multiple  of 5 mg. Subje cts who are assigned  doses of 60 to 180 mg/day  will 
require  admini stration  of two to six 30 mg tablets  per dose. For those subjects 
unable  to swallow  tablet s, capsules may be dispensed. 
 
− The maximum dose of cinacalcet that will be admini stered  at any time during the 
study will be 2.5 mg/kg/day  based on the subject’s day 1 dry weight  in 
Study  20140159  or 180 mg daily, whichever is lower.  
• Subje cts < 6 years of age: 1, 2.5, 5, 7.5, 10, 15, 30, and 60 mg. Subje cts from 
Study  20110100  will either continue  to receive cinacalcet at the same dose as at the 
EOIP  visit if ≤ 14 days have passed between  last dose of cinacalcet treatment  in 
Study  20110100  and day 1 of Study  20140159.  If > 14 days have passed, subjects 
will start cinacalcet in Study  20140159  at 0.20 mg/kg/day  based on the subject’s dry 
weight  at the 20140159  day 1 time point and age at time of enrollment  in 
20110100  study, rounded  down  to the lowe st PSD.  
− Subje cts assigned  a dose between  10 to 60 mg/day  will require  more  than 
1 capsule per dose be sprinkled on soft food or used to create the liquid 
suspension for admini stration.  
− Subje cts enrolling  into 20140159  from 20110100  would  have a maximum  dose of 
2.5 mg/kg/day  based on the subject’s 20140159  day 1 dry weight  or 60 mg daily, 
whichever is lower.  
 
Subje cts will be required  to return  all unused medi cation,  including empty  bottle s, at 
each study visit. Site staff will confirm that the previously assigned  medi cation  bottle( s) 
have been  returned  prior to dispensing a new bottle( s) of IP. In the event unused 
medi cations  or empty bottles have been  permanently  misplaced, contact Amgen  prior to 
dispensing new bottle( s) of IP. 
 
If no ionized calcium values  are available  at the time of a study visit, a new bottle  of IP 
will not be dispensed to the subject. Once the ionized calcium value has been  obtai ned 
and in accessible range, IP may be dispensed as appropria te.

cinacalcet will receive the initial  dose of cinacalcet in the current extension study outlined 
in Table  1 in Section 6.2.3.1.1.1 . 
 
Subje cts from the cinacalcet arm with > 1 month  between  the last dose of cinacalcet 
treatment  in Study  20130356  and Study  20140159  day 1, will receive the initial  dose of 
cinacalcet as defined  in Section 6.2.3.1.1.1.  To commen ce dosing, all subjects must 
have: 
 
• ionized calcium ≥ 1.05 mmol/L  prior to initiation  of treatment  on day 1 in this 
study 
• iPTH  value ≥ 300 pg/mL  within  7 days of day 1 
• corrected calcium value ≥ 8.8 mg/dL  within  7 days of day 1 
 
6.2.3.1.1.1  Dosage  Adjustments  
 
The initial  dose of cinacalcet and all subsequent  doses will be calculated by the site staff 
and confirmed  by the IVR/IWR  system. Subje cts from the SOC arm will start at the initial 
cinacalcet dose of 0.20 mg/kg/day, based on the subject’s dry weight  at day 1 of 
Study  20140159,  rounded  down  to the lowest PSD.  
 
Subje cts from the cinacalcet arm with ≤ 14 days between  the last dose of cinacalcet 
treatment  in Study  20130356  and day 1 of Study  20140159  will start cinacalcet dosing at 
the same dose they received at the completion  of the EOIP  visit and follow weekly dose 
adjustment  based on the Table  1. For subjects from the cinacalcet arm with > 14 days

Study  20140159,  the initial dose of cinacalcet will be 0.20 mg/kg/day, based on the 
subject’s dry weight  at day 1 of 20140159,  rounded  down  to the lowe st PSD,  will be 
assigned.  
 
Dose adjustments  for subjects receiving cinacalcet will be assessed at each weekly visit 
during  the treatment  period.  The daily dose of cinacalcet may only be increased at 
monthly  titration  visits (week 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24); it can’t be increased at any other 
time during  the treatment  period.  At all weekly visits (including week  4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 
and 24), the dose may be maintained,  reduced or withheld  based upon  the dose 
adjustment  criteria  in Table 1. 
 
If any of the criteria  for dose withhol ding are met at any time during  the trial, including 
between  scheduled  study visits (ie, unschedul ed), the dose of cinacalcet is to be 
withheld  until all of the following  criteria are met: 
 
• central  laboratory  corrected calcium value is >8.4 mg/dL

• ionized calcium is >1.05mmol/L  
• subject has no sympto ms of hypocalcemia  
 
• subject doesn’t have any ongoing  adverse event(s) which warrant  withholding  of 
cinacalcet. 
 
If a subject dose is being withheld,  ionized calcium levels should  be assessed weekly 
until an ionized calcium of ˃1.05 mmol/L  is obtained,  at which point,  cCa and iPTH 
should  be assessed by the central  laborator y. 
 
Once all the restart criteria above are met, cinacalcet may be restarted  at one PSD 
below  the previous dose received. Subje cts receiving the lowest PSD (2.5 mg) who 
require  a dose reduction will have their dose withheld  until the criteria  for maintaining  or 
increasing the dose are met, at which time they will restart dosing at 2.5 mg/da y. 
 
If subjects require  temporary  admin istration  of concomitant  medi cations  that are known 
to prolong  the QTc interval, are CYP3A4  inhibito rs, or are CYP2D6  substrates, the 
admini stration of IP is to be withhel d. The dose may be restarted  at one PSD below  the 
previous dose once the treatment  with the concomitant  medication  has completed  and 
all of the restart criteria  above are met. 
 
If IP has been withheld  or missed for > 14 days, the subject will resume dosing at the 
starting  dose level once (initial  dose in parent  Studies  2013 0356 or 20110100)  all restart 
criteria  are met based on dry weight  at day 1 of Study  20140159.

6.2.3.1.2  Subjects  From  Study 20110100  
 
For subjects where  the last dose of cinacalcet treatment  in Study  20110100  and day 1 of 
Study  20140159  occurs within  14 days, in order  to comme nce dosing, subjects from 
Study  20110100  will follow the weekly dose adjustment  criteria as outlined in Table  2 for 
age < 2 years and Table  3 for age ≥ 2 years. Dose titration  cannot  occur until week  4. 
 
For subjects with > 14 days and < 1 month  between last dose of cinacalcet treatment  in 
Study  20110100  and day 1 of Study  2014015 9, in order  to commen ce dosing at the 
initial  dose, all subjects from Study  20110100  must meet  restart criteria  per weekly dose 
adjustment  criteria  as outlined  in Table 2 for age < 2 years and Table  3 for 
age ≥ 2 years. Dose titration  cannot  occur until week  4. 
 
• Additionally  the phosphorus value within  7 days of day 1 should  be: 
− ≥ 5.0 mg/dL  (1.25  mmol /L) if age is < 1 year 
− ≥ 4.5 mg/dL  (1.13  mmol /L) if age is ≥ 1 year 
 
For subjects with > 1 month  between  last dose of cinacalcet treatment  in 
 
Study  20110100  and day 1 of Study  20140159,  in order  to commen ce dosing, subjects 
from Study  20110100  must have: 
 
• ionized calcium prior to initiation  of treatment on day 1 in this study 
− ≥ 1.13 mmol/L  if age is < 2 years 
− ≥ 1.05 mmol/L  if age is ≥ 2 years 
 
• iPTH  value ≥ 300 pg/mL  within  7 days of day 1 
• corrected calcium value within  7 days of day 1 
− ≥ 9.4 mg/dL  if age is < 2 years 
− ≥ 8.8 mg/dL  if age is ≥ 2 years 
 
• phosphorus  value within  7 days of day 1

− ≥ 4.5 mg/dL  (1.13  mmol /L) if age is ≥ 1 year 
 
6.2.3.1.2.1  Subjects  < 2 Years  of Age 
 
The initial  dose of cinacalcet and all subsequent  doses will be calculated by the site staff 
and confirmed  by the IVR/IWR  system. 
 
For subjects with > 14 days since the last dose of cinacalcet treatment  in 
 
Study  20110100  and day 1 of Study  20140159,  subjects will start at the initial  cinacalcet 
dose of 0.20 mg/kg/day, based on the subject’s dry weight  at day 1, in the 
20140159  study rounded  down  to the lowest PSD.

For subjects with ≤ 14 days between  the last dose of cinacalcet in Study  20110100  and 
Study  20140159  day 1, subjects will continue  the same dose of cinacalcet they received 
at the completion  EOIP  visit or early  termination  visit at Study  20110100  termination  and 
follow  the weekly dose adjustments  outlined  in Table  2. Dose titration  cannot  occur until 
week  4. If subjects from the Study  20110100  are on a dose withhold  at day 1 of 
Study  20140159,  the iPTH and cCa restart values  (iPTH  > 150 pg/mL  and 
 
cCa > 9.0 mg/dL)  must be reached prior to resuming cinacalcet in the Study 20140159.  
 
Dose adjustments  for subjects receiving cinacalcet will be assessed at each weekly visit 
during  the treatment  period.  The daily dose of cinacalcet may only be increased at 
monthly  titration  visits (week 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24); it can’t be increased at any other 
time during  the treatment  period.  At all weekly visits (including week  4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 
and 24), the dose may be maintained,  reduced or withheld  based upon  the criteria  in 
Table  2. 
 
If any of the criteria  for dose withhol ding are met at any time during  the trial, including 
between  scheduled  study visits (ie, unschedul ed), the dose of cinacalcet is to be 
withheld  until all of the following  criteria are met: 
 
• central  laboratory  corrected calcium value is >9.0 mg/dL  
• iPTH  is >150  pg/mL 
• ionized calcium is >1.13  mmol/L  
• subject has no sympto ms of hypocalcemia  
 
• subject doesn’t have any ongoing  adverse event(s) which warrant  withho lding of 
cinacalcet. 
 
If a subject dose is being withheld,  ionized calcium levels should  be assessed weekly 
until an ionized calcium of ˃1.13 mmol/L  is obtained,  at which point,  cCa and iPTH 
should  be assessed by the central  laborator y. 
 
Once all the restart criteria above are met, cinacalcet may be restarted  at one PSD 
below  the previous dose received. Subje cts receiving the lowest PSD (1 mg) who 
require  a dose reduction will have their dose withheld  until the criteria  for maintaining  or 
increasing the dose are met, at which time they will restart dosing at 1 mg/da y. 
 
If subjects require  temporary  admin istration  of concomitant  medi cations  that are known

6.2.3.1.3  Missed  Doses 
 
If a subject misses > 14 consecutive doses of cinacalcet for any reason, including 
temporary  dose withhol ding due to the admini stration  of concomitant  medications as 
noted  above, they will be restarted  at their initial dose of cinacalcet (0.20  mg/kg/day 
based on dry weight  at day 1 in Study  20140159)  when  admini stration  of IP resumes  per 
the dose titration  guide lines outlined  in Table  1, Table  2, and Table  3. 
 
6.2.3.2  Measures  of Compliance  With  Cinacalcet  Administration  
 
Poor  complian ce and/or  intermittent  dosing or ingestion of cinacalcet may lead to 
changes  (ie, increases or decreases) in iPTH  and calcium concentrations  that do not 
conform  to those seen in clinical trials where  subjects have consistently received daily 
doses of cinacalcet. Increases in iPTH can be interpreted  to be a result of 
subtherape utic dosing leading  to increases in cinacalcet doses which may result in 
potentially  severe hypocalcemia,  particularly  in the setting  of intermittent  ingestion of IP. 
 
Electronic  patient  diaries (eDiar y) and IP accountability  information  will be reconciled 
and utilized in this study to document  subject complian ce with daily admini stration  of 
cinacalcet therapy. The data entered  into the eDiary  will be available  to the investigator 
and/or  study coordinator  on a daily  basis to enable ongoing  reviews of subject 
complian ce. The eDiary  and IP accountability  data collected will be reviewed  with the 
subject and/or their parent(s) or legal  guardian( s) by the investigator  and/or study 
coordinator  during  the weekly study visits. 
 
For this study non-compliance is defined as: 
 
• missing > 2 doses within  any dosing week, or 
• ≥ 2 documented overdoses within  a dosing week  
• other indicators of non-complian ce per physician judgment  
 
If a subject is considered to be non-compliant,  the dose of cinacalcet should not be 
increased and addition al counseling should  be provided about  the importan ce of taking 
the study medication  as prescribed.  It will also be documented  on the eCRF.  The 
additional  counseling  should  be documented  in the subject’s source document s. If the 
subject remains  non-compliant,  removal from IP dosing should be considered.  
 
6.2.3.3  Overdose  
 
An overdose of cinacalcet will be defined as receiving any dose greater  than the 
assigned  daily dose. This can cause hypocalcemia. Hypocalcemia  may cause anxiety, 
muscular cramping or stiffne ss, twitching,  tingling, paresthesias around  the mouth  or

extremitie s, tetan y, abdominal  cramping,  arrhythmia s, hypoten sion, worsening  of 
pre-existing chronic  heart failure,  convulsions, or death.  
 
If an overdose is suspected, the Amgen  Study  Manager,  Amgen  Medi cal Monitor,  and/or 
Amgen  Clinical Safety  repre sentati ve should  be contacted within 24 hours  of discovery. 
For subjects in whom  an overdose is suspected, close moni toring  for signs and 
symptoms of hypocalcemia and appropriate  measures (eg, including  intravenous  
calcium gluconate  and more  frequent  monitoring  of calcium levels) should  be considered 
by the investigator  in those with acute symptom atic hypocalcemia.  
 
Once hypocalcemia  and any symptoms associated with the overdose have resolved, 
subjects resume cinacalcet admini stration  dose. To resume dosing, the subject must 
meet  the dosing restart criteria  for his/her respective age group  as specified in 
Sections  6.2.3.1.1,  6.2.3 .1.2.1 , and 6.2.3.1.2.2 . 
 
6.3 Hepatotoxici ty Stopp ing and Rechallenge  Rules  
 
Subje cts with abnormal  hepatic  laboratory  values (ie, alkaline phosphatase [ALP], 
aspartate  aminotran sferase [AST],  alanine  aminotran sferase [ALT],  total bilirubin  [TBL]) 
and/or  international  normalized ratio (INR)  and/or  signs/symptoms  of hepatitis  (as 
described  below)  may meet  the criteria  for withholding  or permanent  discontinua tion of 
Amgen  IP or other  proto col-required  therapies  as specified in the Guidan ce for Industry 
Drug -Induced Liver Injury: Premar keting  Clinical Evaluation,  July 2009 . 
 
Cinacalcet is metaboli zed by the liver. Subje cts with mode rate to severe hepatic 
impairment  have the potential  for 2- to 4-fold higher area under  the curve (AUC)  of 
cinacalcet concentration  and may require  additi onal follow-up. 
 
6.3.1  Criteria  for Permanent  Discontinuation  of Amgen  Investigational 
Product  and Other  Protocol -required  Therapies  Due to Potential 
Hepatotoxici ty 
 
Cinacalcet should  be discontinued  permanently  and the subject should  be followed 
according  to the recommendations  in Appendix  A (Additional  Safety  Assessment 
Information)  for possible drug-induced liver injury  (DILI),  if ALL of the criteria below  are 
met: 
 
• TBL > 2 × upper  limit of normal  (ULN) or INR > 1.5  
• AND  increased AST or ALT from the relevant day 1 value as specified below:  
 
 
Baseline AST or ALT value  AST or ALT elevation 
 
< ULN  > 3 × ULN

• AND  no other cause for the combination  of the above laboratory  abnor malities  is 
immediately  apparent;  important  alternati ve causes for elevated AST/ALT  and/or 
TBL values  include,  but are not limited  to: 
− Hepatobilia ry tract disease 
 
− Viral hepatit is (eg, Hepatitis  A/B/C/D/E,  Epstein-Barr Virus, cytomegalo virus, 
Herpes  Simplex Virus, Varicella, toxoplasmosis, and Parvovirus) 
− Right  sided heart  failure,  hypoten sion or any cause of hypoxia to the liver causing 
ischemia.  
− Exposure to hepatoto xic agent s/drugs or hepato toxins, including herbal  and 
dietary  supplement s, plants and mushrooms  
− Heritable  disorders  causing impaired  glucuronida tion (eg, Gilbert’s Syndrome, 
Crigler -Najjar  syndrome)  and drugs  that inhibit  bilirubin  glucuronidation  
(eg, indina vir, atazanavir) 
− Alpha -one antitr ypsin deficiency 
− Alcoholic  hepatitis  
− Autoimmu ne hepatitis  
− Wilson’s disea se and hemochromatosis 
− Nonal coholic Fatty  Liver Disease including  Steatohepatitis  (NASH)  
− Non-hepatic  causes (eg, rhabdom ylosis, hemol ysis) 
 
If an alterna tive cause for hepatoto xicity is ident ified or less stringent  conditions 
developed  than what  are noted  above, determi ne (based on patient  population  and/or 
severity of the hepatot oxicity or event) if Amgen  IP and other  proto col-required  therapies 
should  be withheld  (see section 6.3.2) or perm anently  discontinue d, as deemed 
appropriate  for the safety of the subject.

6.3.2  Criteria  for Conditional  Withholding  of Amgen  Investigational 
Product  and Other  Protocol -required  Therapies  Due to Potential 
Hepatotoxici ty 
For subjects who do not meet  the criteria  for permanent  discontinuation  of Amgen  IP 
outlined  above and have no underl ying liver disease, and eligibility  criteria requiring 
normal  transamina ses and TBL at baseline  or subjects with underl ying liver disease and 
baseline  abnormal  transamina ses, the following  rules  are recommended  for withhold ing 
of Amgen  IP and other  protocol-required therapi es: 
 
• Elevation  of either  AST or ALT according to the following  schedule:  
 
Baseline AST or ALT value  AST or ALT elevation 
 
Any  > 8 × ULN at any time 
 
Any  > 5 × ULN but < 8 × ULN for ≥ 2 weeks 
 
Any  > 5 × ULN but < 8 × ULN and unable to adhere to 
enhanced monitoring  schedule 
 
Any  > 3 × ULN with clinical signs or symptoms that are 
consistent with hepa titis (such as right upper  quadrant 
pain/tenderness, fever, nausea, vomiting, jaundi ce). 
 
• OR: TBL > 3 × ULN at any time 
• OR: ALP > 8 × ULN at any time 
 
Cinacalcet should  be withheld  pend ing investigation into alternative causes of DILI.  If 
investigatio nal produ ct(s) is withheld,  the subject is to be followed according to 
recommen dations  in Appendix  A for possible DILI.  Rechallenge may be considered  if an 
alternati ve cause for impaired  liver tests (ALT,  AST,  ALP)  and/or elevated TBL,  is 
discovered and the laboratory  abnormalities  resolve to normal or baseline 
(Section 6.3.3). 
 
6.3.3  Criteria  for Rechallenge  of Amgen  Investigational  Product  and Other  
Protocol -required  Therapies  After  Potential  Hepatotoxici ty 
 
The decision to rechallenge the subject should  be discussed and agreed  upon 
unanimou sly by the subject’s legally  acceptable  repre sentat ive(s), investigator,  and 
Amgen.  
 
If signs or symptoms recur with rechallenge,  then cinacalcet should  be permanently 
discontin ued. Subje cts who clearly  meet  the criteria  for permanent  discontinuation  (as 
described  in Section 6.3.1) should  never be rechallenged.

All subjects must have a parent  or legal repre sentative sign and personally date the 
IRB/IEC  approved informed consent form before  any study specific procedures  are 
perfor med. In addition,  subjects must sign and personally  date the assent form when 
appli cable prior to the performan ce of any study specific procedure s. See Section 11.1 
for further  detail s. 
 
7.3.2  Demograp hic Data  
 
Demograph ic data including sex, date of birth,  race, and ethnicity will be collected in 
order  to study their possible association  with subject safety  and treatment  effectiveness. 
These data will be transferred  from the studies  20130356  and 20110100.  
 
7.3.3  Medical  and Surgical  Histo ry 
 
The subject’s complete  medi cal and surgical history will be reviewed  on day 1. The 
investigator  or designee  will collect a complete  medi cal and surgical history for 
conditions  that started  within  5 years of the date of enrollment,  including information  on 
the subject’s concurrent  condition s. Ongoing  adverse events and serious adverse 
events in studies  2013 0356 and 20110100  will be entered  as concurrent  conditions  on 
the medi cal history form.  This information  will be recorded  on the medi cal history eCRF 
for subjects enrol led into the study.

The subject’s dry weight  should  be collected at day 1 and  at the EOS  visit post-dialysis 
for hemodial ysis subjects and at the study visit, while  the peritoneal  cavity is empt y, for 
peritoneal  dialysis subjects. For all subjects the weight  is to be measured with the 
subject wearing light clothing  and with his/her shoes remo ved. 
 
7.3.5  Blood  Pressure  and Heart  Rate  
 
The blood  pressure should be taken with the subject’s arm supported  at heart  level using 
the appropr iate sized cuff with the subject comfortably  seated  in a chair with his/her back 
supported  and both feet on the ground.  Subje cts should  be resting quietly for at least 
5 minutes  before  the blood pressure and heart  rate are measured.  For subjects receiving 
hemodial ysis, blood  pressure and heart  rate are to be measured at the conclusion of the 
dialysis session. For subjects receiving peritoneal  dialysis, blood pre ssure and heart  rate 
are to be measured during the study visit. All measurements  will be  recorded  in the 
eCRF.  
 
7.3.6  ECG  
 
The subject must be in a supine  position in a calm and resting state for at least 
 
5 minutes  before  the ECG  assessment  is conducted. If the subject is unable  to be in a 
supine  position, he/she should  be in the most recumbent position possible. 
 
The ECG  must include the following  measurem ents: heart  rate, QRS,  QTc, and RR, QT 
intervals. For the purpo ses of this study, the QTc should  be provided or calculated  using 
Bazett’s formula (QT/√RR).  For subjects receiving hemodial ysis, the ECG  is to be 
obtained  prior to the initiation  of the dialysis session. For subjects receiving periton eal 
dialysis, the ECG  is to be obtained  during  the study visit. All measurem ents will be 
recorded  in the eCRF.  
 
The investigator will review, sign, and date all ECGs. Once signed  the original  ECG 
tracing will remain  in the subject’s source document s. At the reque st of the sponsor, a 
copy of the original  ECG  will be made available  to Amgen.  
 
7.3.7  Concomitant  Medications  
 
Concomitant  medi cations will be collected beginning on day 1 through  the end of study, 
and recorded in the eCRF  for this study as described below.

Commercial cinacalcet is an excluded medi cation during  this study (Section 6.6). For 
subjects who receive commer cial cinacalcet, this will be documented  as a proto col 
deviation  and the name  of the medi cation,  dose, unit, route,  frequen cy, and start and 
stop dates  of admini stration will be collected. 
 
Changes  in dialysate calcium concentration  during the course of the trial will be 
documented  as a proto col deviation.  For subjects in whom  the dialysate calcium 
concentrati on changes  during  the course of the trial, the change in concentration  and 
start date will be collected. 
 
For all other  concomita nt medi cations, including over the counter  and herbal  medi cines, 
the name of the medi cation, start and stop dates  of admini stration  will be collected. 
 
7.3.8  Electronic  Patient  Diary 
 
Subje ct complian ce with daily  administration  of cinacalcet will be collected using a 
handheld  eDiary. The eDiary  will collect date,  time and amount of cinacalcet taken each 
day. Subje cts will use the eDiary  daily  beginning  on day 1 and completi ng at their 
week  28 study visit. It is expected that children  under the age of 12 will have their 
parent( s) or legal  guard ian(s) complete  the eDiary  daily. Children  ≥ 12 years of age may 
either  have their parent (s) or legal  guardian( s) complete  the eDiary  daily  or do this 
them selves under  the supervision of their parent (s) or legal  guardian( s). The subjects 
will be instructed to bring  their eDiary  with them  to every study visit. The data entered 
into the eDiary will be available  to the investigator and/or  study coordinator  on a daily 
basis to enable ongoing  reviews of subject compliance. The data collected will be 
reviewed  with the subject by the investigator  and/or study coordinator  during the weekly 
study visits. The investigator  and/or  study coordinator  will also reconcile any 
discrepan cies between  the eDiary  and the IP accountability  data during  the weekly study 
visits. Reasons for discrepan cies will be documented  and subjects and/or parent s/legal 
guardians  counseled on the importan ce of complian ce with the admini stration  of 
cinacalcet during  the trial. The data collected will be captur ed in the study databa se. 
 
Refer  to Section 6.2.3.2  for additional  information  regarding  the measures of complia nce 
for this study and the eDiary  manual for additi onal detail s. 
 
7.3.9  Ionized Calcium  
 
All ionized calcium values  will be collected as specified in the Schedule  of Assessments 
for identif ication of potential hypocalcemia.  Ionized calcium values  will be obtained 
either  per routine  practice at the clinical site or using a point  of care device provided by

Amgen.  The clinical site will document  the method  that is being used to obtain  the 
ionized calcium for each subject enrolled at the site and ensure that this remains 
consistent for the durat ion of the trial. All measurements  should  occur on the day of the 
study visit prior to the administration  of cinacalcet. For sites that use the point  of care 
device provided by Amgen, refer  to the device manual  provided for further  information.  
 
The measurements  obtained  will be entered  into the IVR/IWR  system at each study visit 
and entered  into the eCRF.  
 
In addition,  cCa values  from the central  laborato ry will be collected as specified in the 
Schedule  of Assessments. These cCa values  will be utilized for monthly  dose titrati on 
visits. 
 
7.3.10  Adverse  Events 
 
Adverse events will be collected in the eCRF  for each subject at all study visits. 
Targeted  questions  regarding  hypocalcemia,  seizures and infections  will be asked and 
data will be entered  into the eCRF  at each study visit. 
 
All clinically significant (according  to the investigator’s  judgment),  labora tory 
abnormalities  will be reported  as adverse events. In assessing clinical significance of a 
low serum  calcium value,  the investigator  should  consider factors such as presence of 
clinical symptoms  associated  with hypocalcaemia,  dose adjustment  of cinacalcet or 
concomitant  medi cations (eg, vitamin  D, phosphate  binder s). In addition,  the 
investigator  should  indicate on the eCRF  wheth er hypocalcemia was symptomati c, and if 
so provide the accompanying symptoms. 
 
Serious  adverse events that occur in a subject from the date of the first dose through  
 
30 days after the last dose of IP will be recorded  in the adverse event eCRF.  All 
adverse events that occur from the date of the first dose through 30 days after the last 
dose of IP will be recorded in the adverse event eCRF.  Refer to Section 9 for additi onal 
information.  
 
7.3.11  Laborato ry Assessments  
 
All study laboratory  samples, with the exception  of the ionized calcium sample s, will be 
processed and sent to the central  laboratory  for assessment.  The central  laboratory  will 
provide a study manual  that outlines  handling,  labeling,  and shipping  procedures  for all 
blood  sample s. All blood samples  will be obtained via venipun cture prior to the 
admini stration of IP. The date and time of the sample  collection will be recorded  in the 
source documents  at the site.

serum albumin level is ≥ 4.0 g/dL. 
Corrected calcium (mg/dL) = Measu red total serum calcium (mg/dL) + 0.8 (4.0-serum albumin [g/dL]) 
 
7.3.12 Home Healthcare  
 
Subjects receiving peritoneal dialysis may not have to be seen  routinely by the 
investigator at the clinical site on a weekly basis.  These  subjects will be required to be 
seen  in the clinic every 2 weeks, including the week prior to the monthly dosing titration 
visit and those  visits where central laboratory samples are collected, at a minimum 
during the trial. The investigator may utilize their site staff or a qualified home healthcare 
service provider to conduct the proced ures required for remaining weekly study visits, 
subject to the investigator’s direction and oversight. 
 
7.4 Biomark er Developm ent 
 
Biomarkers are objectively measu red and evaluated indicators of normal biologic 
processe s, pathogenic processe s, or pharmacologic responses  to a therapeutic 
intervention. Biomarker development can be useful in developing markers to identify 
disease  subtypes, guide therapy, and/or predict disease  severity.

Blood  samples  are to be collected for biomar ker development at the follow ing time 
point s: day 1 and EOIP  visit (week  28). 
 
7.5 Sample  Storage  and Destruction  
 
Any blood  or biomar ker sample  collected according to the Schedule  of Assessments 
(Table  4) can be analyzed for any of the tests outlined  in the proto col and for any tests 
necessary to minimi ze risks to study subjects. This includes  testing to ensure analytical 
methods  produ ce reliab le and valid data throughout  the course of the study. This can 
also include,  but is not limited  to, investigation  of unexpected results, incurred  sample 
reanal ysis, and analyses for method  transfer and comparabilit y. 
 
All samples  and associated results will be coded prior to being shipped  from the site for 
analysis or storage.  Samples  will be tracked using a unique  identif ier that is assigned to 
the samples  for the study. Results are stored  in a secure database to ensure 
confidenti ality. 
 
If permitted  by local regulations  and informed  consent is provided by the subject’s legally 
acceptable  representati ve(s), Amgen  can do additional  testing on remaining  samples  
(ie, residual  and back-up) to investigate and better under stand the CKD  and SHPT,  the 
dose response and/or  prediction of response to cinacalcet, and characterize aspects of 
the mole cule (eg, mechanism of action/target,  metabolite s). Results from this analysis 
are to be documented  and maintained,  but are not necessarily reported  as part of this 
study. Samples can be retained  for up to 20 years. 
 
Since the evaluations  are not expected to benefit  the subject directly or to alter the 
treatment  course, the results of pharmacogeneti c, biomar ker developm ent, or other 
exploratory  studies  are not placed in the subject’s medi cal record and are not to be 
made  available to the subject, members  of the family, the personal physician, or other 
third partie s, except as specified in the informed  consent. 
 
The subject retains  the right to request that the sample  mate rial be destroyed by 
contacting the investigator. Follow ing the reque st from the subject, the investigator  is to 
provide the sponsor with the requi red study and subject number  so that any remain ing 
blood  samples  and any other  components  from the cells can be located and destroyed. 
Samples  will be destroyed once all protocol-defined procedures are completed.

Howe ver, information  collected from samples  prior to the reque st for destruction, will be 
retained  by Amgen. 
 
The sponsor is the exclusive owner  of any data,  discoveries, or derivative materials  from 
the sample  materials  and is responsible for the destruction of the sample( s) at the 
reque st of the subject through  the investigator,  at the end of the storage  period, or as 
appropriate  (eg, the scientific rationale for experimentation  with a certain  sample  type no 
longer  justifies keeping  the sample).  If a comme rcial produ ct is developed from this 
research project, the sponsor owns  the comme rcial produ ct. The subject has no 
commer cial rights  to such produ ct and has no commer cial rights  to the data, information, 
discoveries, or derivative materials  gained  or produced from the sample.  See 
Section 11.3 for subject confidenti ality. 
 
8. WITHD RAWAL  FROM TREA TMENT, PROCEDUR ES, AND STUDY 
Subje cts have the right to withdraw  from the study at any time and for any reason 
without  prejudice to their future  medi cal care by the physician or at the institution.  
 
Subje cts (or a legally  acceptable  representati ve) can decline to continue  receiving IP 
and/or  other  proto col-required  therapies or procedures  at any time during the study but 
continue  participation in the study. If this occurs, the investigator is to discuss with the 
subject the appropriate  processes for discontinuation  from IP or other  proto col-requi red 
therapies  and must discuss with the subject the options  for continuation  of the Schedule 
of Assessments (Table  4) and collection of data, including  endpoints  and adverse 
events. The investigator  must document  the change  to the Schedule  of Assessments 
(Table  4) and the level of follow -up that is agreed to by the subject (eg, in person, by 
telephone/mail,  through  family/friend s, in corresponden ce/communi cation  with other 
physicians, from review of the medi cal records). 
 
Withdrawal  of consent for a study means  that the subject does not wish to receive 
further  proto col-required  therapies  or procedure s, and the subject does  not wish to or is 
unable  to continue  further study participation.  Subject data up to withdrawal  of consent 
will be included in the analysis of the study, and where  permitted,  publicly available  data 
can be included after withdrawal  of consent. The investigator  is to discuss with the 
subject appropriate  procedures  for withdrawal  from the study. 
 
8.1 Investigator  or Spon sor Decision  to Withdraw  or Term inate 
Subjects’  Participation  Prior  to Study Comp letion  
 
The investigator and/or  sponsor can decide to withdraw  a subject(s) from IP, proto col 
procedure s, or the study as a whole  at any time prior to study completion.

proto col-required  therap ies by a separate  proto col or as provided for by the local 
countr y’s regulatory  mechanism, based on parameters  consistent with Section 12.1. 
 
8.2 Reasons  for Removal  From  Study 
 
8.2.1  Reasons  for Removal  From  Trea tment  
 
Reasons for remo val from proto col-required  IP(s) or procedural assessments  include 
any of the following:  
 
• subject request 
• safety  concern (eg, due to an adverse event, proto col deviation, non-complian ce, 
requirement  for alternat ive therap y, pregnan cy) 
• proto col-specified criteria (eg, renal  transplant,  parath yroide ctomy) 
• death  
• lost to follow-up 
• decision by sponsor (other than subject reque st, safety  concern, lost to follow-up) 
 
8.2.2  Reasons  for Removal  From  Study 
 
Reasons for remo val of a subject from the study are: 
 
• decision by sponsor 
• withdrawal  of consent from study 
• death  
• lost to follow-up 
 
9. SAFETY  DATA  COLLECTI ON, RECORDING, AND  REPORTI NG 
 
9.1 Adverse  Events 
 
9.1.1  Definition  of Adverse  Events  
 
An adverse event is defined as any untoward  medical occurrence in a clinical trial 
subject.  The event does  not necessarily have a causal relation ship with study treatment. 
The investigator is responsible for ensuring  that any adverse events observed by the 
investigator  or reported  by the subject are recorded in the subject’s medical record. 
 
The definiti on of adverse events includes worsening of a pre-existing medi cal condition. 
Worsening  indicates that the pre-existing medi cal conditi on (eg, diabet es, migraine 
heada ches, gout)  has increased in severity, frequency, and/or  duration,  and/or  has an 
association with a significantly  worse outcome.  A pre-existing condition  that has not 
worsened  during  the study or involves an intervention  such as elective cosmetic  surgery 
or a medi cal procedure  while  on study is not considered  an adverse event.

If the toxicity grade  of an adverse event worsens from the date of onset to the date of 
resolution,  record as a single  event with the worst CTCAE  grade on the Adverse Event 
Summary  eCRF.  
 
The investigator’s  clinical judgment  is used to determine  whether a subject is to be 
remo ved from treatment  due to an adverse event. In the event a subject, or subject’s 
legally  acceptable  representati ve reque sts to withdraw  from proto col-required  therap ies 
or the study due to an adverse event, refer  to Section 6.3.1  for additional  instructions on 
the procedures recommended  for safe withdrawal  from proto col-requir ed therapies  or 
the study. 
 
9.1.2  Definition  of Serious  Adverse  Events  
 
A serious  adverse event is defined  as an adverse event that meets  at least 1 of the 
following  serious criteria: 
 
• fatal 
• life threaten ing (places the subject at immediate  risk of death) 
• requires  in-patient  hospitalization  or prolongation  of existing hospitalization 
• results in persistent or significant disabilit y/incapacity 
• congenital  anomal y/birth  defect 
• other  medi cally important  serious  event 
 
An adverse event would  meet the criterion  of “requires  hospitalization”,  if the event 
necessitated an admi ssion to a health care facility (eg, overnight stay). 
 
If an investigator  considers an event to be clinically important,  but it does  not meet  any 
 
of the serious criteria,  the event could be classified as a serious adverse event under  the 
criterion  of “other  medi cally important  serious  event”. Examples  of such events could 
include allergic bronchospasm, convulsions, blood dyscrasias, DILI (see Appendix  A for 
drug-induced liver injury  reporting  criteria),  or events that necessitate an emergen cy 
room  visit, outpatient  surgery, or urgent  intervention.  
 
9.2 Reporting  of Adverse  Events  
 
Ongoing  adverse events and serious adverse events in studies 20130 356 or 20110100, 
will be entered as a concurrent  condition on the Medi cal History eCRF.  
 
9.2.1  Reporting  Procedures  for Adver se Events  That  do not Meet  Serious 
Criteria  
 
The investigator is responsible for ensuring  that all adverse events observed by the 
investigator  or reported  by the subject that occur from the date of the first dose and up to

30 days after the last dose of IP, are reported  using the applicable eCRF  (eg, Adverse 
 
Event Summary). 
 
The investigator must assign the following  adverse event attribute s: 
 
• adverse event diagno sis or syndrome(s), if known (if not known, signs or 
symptoms), 
• dates  of onset and resolution  (if resolved), 
• toxicity, 
• assessment  of relatedn ess toIP, and 
• action taken. 
 
The adverse event grading  scale used will be the Common Terminology  Criteria  for 
Adverse Events (CTC AE, v4.0). The grading  scale used in this study is described  in 
Appendix  A. The investigator  must assess whet her the adverse event is possibly related 
to the IP. This relatio nship is indicated by a “yes” or “no” response to the question: Is 
there  a reasonab le possibility  that the event may have been  caused by the IP? 
 
The investigator is responsible for reviewing  laboratory  test results and determining 
whether  an abnormal  value in an individual  study subject represents a clinically 
significant change  from the subject’s baseline  values. In general, abno rmal laboratory 
findings  without clinical signifi cance (based on the investigator's judgment) are not to be 
recorded  as adverse events. Howe ver, laborato ry value changes  that require  treatment 
or adjustment  in current  therapy  are considered  adverse events. Where  appli cable, 
clinical sequelae (not the laboratory  abnormalit y) are to be recorded  as the adverse 
event. 
 
The Investigator  is expected to follow reported  adverse events until stabilization  or 
reversibility.  
 
9.2.2  Reporting  Procedures  for Serious  Adverse  Events  
 
The investigator is responsible for ensuring  that all serious adverse events observed by 
the investigator or reported  by the subject that occur from the date of the first dose 
through  30 days after the last day of the dosing interval of IP or end of study visit 
(whichever is later)  are recorded  in the subject’s medi cal record and are submitted  to 
Amgen.  All serious  adverse events must be submitted  to Amgen  within  24 hours 
following  the investigato r’s knowledge of the event via the serious  adverse event form. 
 
After  the proto col-requir ed reporting  period  defined above, the investigator does  not 
need  to actively monitor  subjects for serious  adverse events. Howe ver, if the

investigator  becomes aware  of a serious adverse event after this proto col-required 
reporting  period, the investigator  will report  the event to Amgen within  24 hours  following 
the investigator’s  knowledge  of the event. Serious  adverse events reported  outside of 
the proto col-required  report ing period  will be captured within  the safety  databa se as 
clinical trial cases for the purpo ses of expedited  reporting.  
 
See Appendix  A for a sample  of the Serious  Adverse Event Worksheet.  
 
The investigator must assess wheth er the serious  adverse event is possibly related  to 
any study-mandated  activity or procedure.  This relation ship is indicated by a “yes” or 
“no” response to the question: “Is there a reasonable  possibility  that the event may have 
been  caused by a study activity/procedure”?  
 
The investigator is expected to follow reported  serious  adverse events until stabilization 
or reversibility. 
 
New information  relati ng to a previously reported  serious  adverse event must be 
submitted  to Amgen . All new information  for serious adverse events must be sent to 
Amgen  within 24 hours  following  knowledge  of the new information.  The investigator 
may be asked to provide additional  follow-up information,  which may include a discharge 
summa ry or extracts from the medi cal record. Information  provided about  the serious 
adverse event must be consistent with that recorded on the applicable eCRF 
(eg, Adverse Event Summa ry eCRF). 
 
If a subject is permanently  withdrawn  from proto col-required  therapies  because of a 
serious  adverse event, this informat ion must be submitted  to Amgen.  
 
Amgen  will report  serious adverse events and/or  suspected unexpected serious  adverse 
reactions  as required  to regulatory  authoritie s, investigator s/institutio ns, and IRBs/IECs  
in complian ce with all reporting  requirements  according  to local regulatio ns and good 
clinical practice. 
 
The investigator is to notify the appropriate  IRB/IEC  of serious  adverse events occurring 
at the site and other  adverse event reports  received from Amgen,  in accordan ce with 
local procedures and statutes. 
 
9.3 Pregnan cy and Lactation  Report ing 
 
If a pregna ncy occurs in a female  subject, or female  partner  of a male  subject, while  the 
subject is taking proto col-required  therapy,  report  the pregn ancy to Amg en as specified 
below.

In addit ion to reporting  any pregnan cies occurring during  the study, investigators  should 
monitor  for pregnan cies that occur after the last dose of cinacalcet through 90 days. 
 
The pregnan cy should  be reported  to Amgen’s  Global  Patient  Safety  within 24 hours  of 
the investigator’s  knowledge  of the event of a pregnan cy. Report  a pregnan cy on the 
Pregnan cy Notifi cation  Worksheet (Appendix  C). Amgen  Global Patient  Safety  will seek 
to follow  the pregnant  woman  throughout  her pregnan cy and her baby  up to 12 months 
after birth.  
 
If a lactation  case occurs while  the female  subject is taking cinacalcet report the lactation 
case to Amgen  as specified below.  
 
In addition  to reporting  a lactation  case during  the study, investigators  should  monitor  for 
lactation  cases that occur after the last dose of cinacalcet through  90 days. 
 
Any lactation  case should be repor ted to Amgen’s Global  Patient  Safety within  24 hours 
of the investigator’s  knowledge  of event. Repo rt a lactation  case on the Lactation 
Notifi cation  Worksheet (Appendix  C).

10.2 Sample  Size Considerations  
 
This is an extension study of Studies  20130356  and 20110100.  The sample  size may 
be up to 78 subjects. 
 
10.3 Planned  Analyses 
 
10.3.1  Interim  Analysis 
 
Several interim  analyses may be condu cted. The first interim analysis will be performed 
to support  the Supplemental  New Drug Appli cation (sNDA)  for pediatric  indication.  Its 
scope of analysis will be limited  to the planned  analysis using 20140159  study data only. 
The rest of interim  analyses may be performed  to support  further  reque st from 
regulator y. The scope of these analyses will be specified in a separate  statistical 
analysis plan of interim  analysis. There is no plan to conduct formal  statistical testing. 
There  are no plans  to change  the condu ct of the study based on interim analysis results. 
 
10.3.2  Prima ry Analysis 
 
The general  approa ch is to provide estimates  for the primary  and secondary endpoints 
for the study population.  
 
The primary  analysis of all endpoin ts will be conducted after all subjects have completed 
the week  32 EOS  visit or terminated  early  from Study 20140159.

10.4 Planned  Methods  of Analysis 
 
10.4.1  General  Considerations  
 
There  is no formal  statistical testing for this study. The analysis for all endpoints  will be 
descriptive in nature.  Descriptive statistics will be used to summari ze data for 
continuous  variables  (including  n, mean, standa rd deviation  (SD)  or standard  error  (SE), 
median,  25th (Q1) and 75th (Q3) percentile s, and minimum  and maximum values, where 
appli cable).  
 
For categor ical variable s, the number  and percentage  of subjects in each category  will 
be reported.  Graphi cal presentatio ns may be provided for selected variables. 
 
All summary tables  will be provided  by study treatment  group:  Study  20130356  (SOC, 
SOC  + cinacalcet) and Study  20110100  and overall, unless otherwi se specified. 
 
10.4.2  Prima ry Endpoint  
 
The analysis of the primary  endpoint  will be based on the Safety  Analysis Set. The 
primary  analysis of the primary endpoint is subject incidence of events of intere st (EOI;

pancreatit is, drug-related hepatic  disorder s, nervous system disorders  [excluding 
seizures], neopla stic events, and infection) for data in the 20140159  study only.  The 
secondary  analysis of the primary  endpoint  is the incidence of events of intere st adjusted 
by the amount of safety  follow -up time for combined  data from parent  studies  and data 
from the 20140159  study. The 95% confiden ce intervals (CI) of the overall incidence 
rates  will be reported.  
 
10.4.3  Seconda ry Endpoints  
 
The analysis of seconda ry endpo ints will be based  on Effica cy Analysis Set. The 
approach  for handling  the missing  data will be described  for each  endpoint  in the 
statistical  analysis plan .

The safety  analysis will be based on the safety  analysis set. All safety  endpoints  in 
 
20140159  study only and combined  with their parent studies  will be summari zed by 
treatment  group  in the parent  studies and overall.  
 
Adverse Events 
 
All treatment -emergent  adverse events occurring during  the study will be coded  using 
the latest version of the MedD RA dictionary.  The subject incidence of all 
treatment -emergent  adverse events, serious  adverse events, treatment -related  adverse 
events, and serious  treatment -related  adverse events will be tabulated  by system organ 
class and preferred  term in descending order  of frequen cy. Tables  of 
treatment -emergent  adverse events, fatal adverse events, serious  adverse events, and 
adverse events leading  to withdrawal  from investigational  product or from study will be 
tabulated  by preferred  term.  
 
Laboratory  Data,  Blood  Pressure, and Heart  Rate  
 
Descriptive statistics for values, changes  and percent changes of selected laborato ry 
parameters  from first dose of IP date will be presented  at each measurement  time point 
during  the study. In addition,  shift tables will summarize grades using CTCAE  
(version 3) by worst grades  between  baseline  and any visit up to the end of the study for 
selected hematology  and chemi stry parameter s. 
 
The incidence of hypocalcemia  after the first dose of IP will be summarized using 
descriptive statistics. Hypocalcemia  will be defined in two ways: with the subject 
incidence of corrected serum  calcium of < 7.5 mg/dL,  < 8.0 mg/dL,  and < 8.4 mg/dL 
being  summarized; and with subject incidence of ionized calcium value < 0.94 mmo l/L, 
< 1.05 mmo l/L, and < 1.00 mmol/L  being summarized. Blood pressure (systolic and 
diastolic) and heart  rate will be summari zed at each time point. 
 
Medi cations  of Intere st 
 
Use of vitamin D sterols  and phosphate binders  during  study. 
 
ECG  
 
The ECG  measurements  from this clinical study will be performed  as per standard  of 
care for routine safety  monitoring,  rather than for purpo ses of assessment  of potential 
QTc effect. Since these evaluations  may not necessarily be performed  under  the 
rigorous  conditions  expected to lead to meaningful  evaluati on of QTc data,  summari es

11. REGULA TORY  OBL IGAT IONS  
 
11.1 Informed  Consent  
 
An initial  sample  informed consent form is provided for the investigator  to prepare  the 
informed  consent document  to be used at his or her site. Updates  to the template  are to 
be commun icated formally  in writing  from the Amgen clinical study manager to the 
investigator.  The written  informed consent document is to be prepared  in the 
language( s) of the poten tial patient  population.  
 
Before  a subject’s participation  in the clinical study, the investigator  is responsible for 
obtaining  written  informed  consent from the subject or legally acceptab le repre sentative 
after adequate  explanation  of the aims, metho ds, anticipated benefit s, and potential 
hazards of the study and before  any proto col-specific screening procedures or any 
investigatio nal produ ct(s) is/are admini stered.  A legally  acceptable  repre sentati ve is an 
individual  or other  body  authori zed under appli cable law to consent, on behalf of a 
prospective subject, to the subject’s participation  in the clinical study. 
 
The investigator is also responsible for asking the subject if the subject has a primary 
care physician and if the subject agrees to have his/her primary  care physician informed 
of the subject’s participation in the clinical study. If the subject agrees  to such 
notifi cation, the investigator is to inform the subject’s prima ry care physician of the 
subject’s participation  in the clinical study. If the subject does not have a primary  care 
physician and the investigator  will be acting in that capacity, the investigator is to 
document  such in the subject’s medical record. 
 
The acquisition of informed  consent and the subject’s agreement  or refusal of his/her 
notifi cation of the primary care physician is to be documented  in the subject’s medi cal 
records, and the informed  consent form is to be signed  and personally  dated  by the 
subject or a legally  acceptable  representati ve and by the person who conducted the 
informed  consent discussion. The original  signed  informed  consent form is to be 
retained  in accordan ce with institutional policy, and a copy of the signed consent form is 
to be provided to the subject or legally acceptab le repre sentative. 
 
If a potential  subject is illiterate  or visually impaired  and does  not have a legally 
acceptable  representati ve, the investigator  must provide an impartial  witne ss to read the 
informed  consent form to the subject and must allow  for questions. Thereafter,  both the

subject and the witne ss must sign the informed  consent form to attest that informed 
consent was freely  given and under stood. 
 
In this study, obtaining  assent from the child and consent from the parents  or legally 
authori zed representati ve, except if the child is very young,  as defined  by local law will 
apply.  A child is defined as a person who has not attained  the legal  age for consent for 
treatments  or procedures involved in clinical investigatio ns, under the appli cable law of 
the jurisdiction in which the clinical investigation  will take place. The local IRB/IEC  will 
determine  the process for obtaining  and documenting  the assent process for pediatric 
subject, but should  follow the guidel ines established by the Depart ment of Health  and 
Human  Services (DHHS)  Office of Human  Research Prote ctions guideli nes, which state 
an explanation  of the procedures  involved in the study should  be made in a langu age 
appropriate  to the child’s age, experien ce, maturit y, and condition.

the proto col, proposed informed  consent form,  other  written  subject information,  and any 
propo sed advertising mater ial must be submitted  to the IRB/IEC  for written  appro val. A 
copy of the written  appro val of the proto col and informed consent form must be received 
by Amgen before  recruitment  of subjects into the study and shipment  of Amgen 
investigational  product. 
 
The investigator must submit  and, where  necessary, obtain  appro val from the IRB/IEC 
for all subsequent  proto col amendm ents and changes  to the informed  consent 
document.  The investigator is to notify the IRB/IEC of deviations from the proto col or 
serious  adverse events occurring  at the site and other  adverse event reports  received 
from Amgen,  in accordance with local procedures. 
 
The investigator is responsible for obtaining  annual IRB/IEC  approval/renewal 
throughout  the duration  of the study. Copies  of the investigator’s reports  and the 
IRB/IEC  continuan ce of appro val must be sent to Amgen.  
 
11.3 Subject  Confidentiality  
 
The investigator must ensure that the subject’s confidentiality  is maintained  for 
documents  submitted  to Amgen.  
 
• Subje cts are to be identi fied by a unique  subject identifi cation number.  
• Where  permitted,  date of birth is to be documented  and formatted  in accordan ce

termination  of the study and before  the produ ct(s) is/are available comm ercially. 
 
12.2 Study Documentation  and Archive  
 
The investigator is to maintain  a list of appropria tely qualified  persons to whom  he/she 
has delega ted study dutie s. All persons authori zed to make entries  and/or corrections 
on CRFs  will be included on the Amgen Delegation  of Authority Form.  
 
Sour ce documents  are original  document s, data,  and records from which the subject’s 
CRF data are obtained.  These include but are not limited  to hospital records, clinical 
and office charts, labor atory and pharma cy records, diarie s, microfiches, radiograph s, 
and corresponden ce. 
 
The Investigator  and study staff are responsible for maintaining  a comprehen sive and 
centrali zed filing system of all study-related  (essential)  documentation,  suitable  for 
inspection at any time by repre sentati ves from Amgen  and/or  appli cable regulatory 
authoritie s. 
 
Elements  should  include: 
 
• Subje ct files containing  completed  CRFs, informed  consent forms, and subject 
identifi cation list 
• Study  files containing  the proto col with all amendment s, IB, copies  of prestudy 
documentation,  and all correspond ence to and from the IRB/IEC and Amgen 
• Investigati onal produ ct-related  corresponden ce including  Proof of Receipts 
(POR),  Investigational  Produ ct Accountability  Record(s), Return  of Investigational 
Produ ct for Destruction Form( s), Final  Investigational Produ ct Reconciliation 
Statement,  as appli cable. 
 
In addition,  all origin al source documents  supporting  entries in the eCRFs  must be 
maintained  and be readily available.  
 
Retention  of study documents  will be governed  by the Clinical Trial Agreement.  
 
12.3 Study Mon itoring  and Data  Collection

research. The clinical monitor  is to have access to subject medical records and other 
study-related  records needed  to verify the entries  on the CRF s. 
 
The investigator agrees  to cooperate  with the clinical monitor  to ensure that any 
proble ms detected in the course of these monitoring  visits, including  delays in 
completing  CRFs, are resolved. 
 
In accordance with ICH GCP  and the sponsor’s audit  plans, this study may be selected 
for audit  by repre sentati ves from Amgen’s  Global  Complian ce Auditing  function (or 
designee s). Inspection of site facilities (eg, pharmacy, protocol-required  therapy  storage 
areas, laboratorie s) and review of study-related  records will occur to evaluate  the study 
condu ct and complian ce with the proto col, ICH GCP,  and appli cable regulatory 
requirement s. 
 
Data  capture  for this study is plann ed to be electronic: 
 
• All source documentation  supporting  entries  into the CRFs  must be maintained 
and readily  available.  
• Updates  to CRFs  will be automati cally documented  through  the software’s  “audit 
trail”.  
• To ensure the quality  of clinical data across all subjects and sites, a clinical data 
manage ment review is performed  on subject data received at Amgen.  During 
this review, subject data are checked for consistency, omissions, and any 
apparent  discrepan cies. In addition,  the data are reviewed  for adheren ce to the 
proto col and GCP.  To resolve any questions  arising from the clinical data 
manage ment review process, data queries  and/or site notifications  are created  in 
the EDC  system databa se for site resolution  and subsequent ly closed by the 
EDC  system or by an Amgen  reviewer. 
• The investigator signs only the Investigator  Verification  Form for this EDC  study. 
This signature indicates that the investigator  inspected or reviewed  the data on 
the CRF,  the data queries, and the site notifications, and agrees with the content.  
 
Amgen  (or designee)  will perform  self-evident  corrections  to obvious data errors  in the 
clinical trial databa se, as documented  in the Study Specific Self Evident  Corre ctions 
Plan.  Examples of obvious data errors that may be corrected by Amgen  (or designee) 
include deletion of obvious dupli cate data (eg, same results sent twice with the same 
date with different  visit-week  4 and early  termi nation)  and clarifying “other,  specify” if 
data are provided (eg, race, physical examinatio n). Each investigati ve site will be 
provided a list of the types of corrections appli ed to study data at the initiation  of the trial 
and at study closeout.

To facilitate appropriate  monitoring  for signals  of DILI,  cases of concurrent AST or ALT 
and TBL and/or  INR elevation  according to the criteria  specified in Section 6.3 requi re 
the followin g: 
 
• The event is to be reported  to Amg en as a serious adverse event within  24 hours 
of discovery or notifi cation of the event (ie, before additional  etiologic 
investigatio ns have been  concluded)  
• The appropriate  CRF  (eg, Adverse Event CRF) that captur es information 
necessary to facilitate the evaluation  of treatment -emergent  liver abnormalities  is 
to be completed  and sent to the Amgen.  
 
Other  events of hepato toxicity and potential  DILI are to be reported  as serious  adverse 
events if they meet  the criteria  for a serious  adverse event defined  in Section 9.1.2 . 
 
Additional  Clinical  Assessments  and Obser vation  
 
All subjects in whom  investigation al produ ct(s) or proto col-required  therapies is/are 
withheld  (either permanently  or conditionall y) due to potent ial DILI as specified in 
Sections  6.3.1 and 6.3.2  or who experience AST or ALT elevations  > 3 x ULN are to 
undergo  a period  of “close observation” until abnormalities  return to normal  or to the 
subject’s baseline  levels. Assessments that are to be performed  during  this period 
include:  
 
• Repeat  AST, ALT,  ALP,  bilirubin  (total and direct), and INR within 24 hours 
• In cases of TBL > 2x ULN or INR > 1.5,  retesting of liver tests, BIL (total  and 
direct), and INR is to be performed  every 24 hours until laboratory  abnormalities

initial  dose of cinacalcet as defined  in Section 6.2.3.1.1.1  
 
Subje cts from the cinacalcet arm will follow  the dose adjus tments  outlined in Table 1 in 
Section 6.2.3.1.1.1 .  If subjects from the cinacalcet arm in 20130356  are on a dose 
withhold  at 20140159  day 1, the iPTH  and cCa restart values  (iPTH  > 100 pg/mL  and 
cCa > 8.4 mg/dL)  must be reached prior to resuming  cinacalcet in the current extension 
study.  Subje cts from the cinacalcet arm, who have had their dose withhe ld for 
> 1 month  at the time of 20140159  day 1 will not be eligible  for this study.

The initial  dose of cinacalcet and all subsequent  doses will be calculated by the site staff 
and confirmed  by the IVR/IWR  system.  Subje cts from the SOC arm will start at the initial 
cinacalcet dose of 0.20 mg/kg/day, based on the subject’s dry weight  at day 1, rounded 
down  to the lowest PSD.  Subje cts from the cinacalcet arm will start cinacalcet dosing on 
day 1 at the same dose of cinacalcet they received at the completion  of the treatment 
period  (week  20) in the parent  study or titrate  based on the Table 1 in Section 6.2.3. 1.2. 
The initial  dose of cinacalcet will be assigned  to subjects restarting  cinacalcet after 
withholding  the dose for more  than 14 days during  the study.

Dose  adjustments  for subjects  receiving  cinacalcet  will be assessed  at each 
weekly visit during  the treatment  period.  The daily dose  of cinacalcet  may only be 
increased  at month ly titration  visits  (week 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24); it can’t  be 
increased  at any other  time during  the treatment  period.  At all weekly visits 
(including  week 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 17, 18, 19, 21, 22, 23, 25, 26, and 
27), the dose  may be maintained,  reduced  or withheld based upon  the criteria  in 
 
Table  1. 
 
If any of the criteria  for dose  withholding  are met at any time during  the trial, 
including  between scheduled  study visits  (ie, unscheduled),  the dose  of cinacalcet 
is to be withheld  until  all of the following criteria  are met:  
 
• Central  laboratory  corrected calcium value is > 8.4 mg/dL  
 
• iPTH  is > 100 pg/mL  
 
• Ionized calcium is > 1.05mmol/L  
 
• Subje ct has no sympto ms of hypocalcemia 
 
• Subject  doesn’t  have  any ongoi ng adverse  event(s)  which warrant  withholding 
of cinacalcet.  
 
If a subject  dose  is being  withhel d, ionized calcium  levels should  be assessed 
weekly until an ionized calcium  of ˃ 1.05 mmol/L  is obtai ned, at which point,  cCa 
and iPTH  should  be assessed  by the central  laborato ry. 
 
Once  all the restart  criteria  above  are met, cinacalcet  may be restar ted at one PSD 
below  the previous dose received.  Subjects  receiving  the lowest PSD (2.5 mg) who 
require  a dose  reduction  will have their  dose  withheld  until  the criteria  for 
maintaining  or increasing  the dose  are met, at which time they will restart  dosing 
at 2.5 mg/d ay. 
 
If subjects require  temporary  admin istration  of concomitant  medi cations  that are known to 
prolong  the QTc interval, are CYP3A4  inhibito rs, or are CYP2D6  substrates, the 
admini stration of IP is to be withhel d.  The dose may be restarted  at one PSD below  the 
previous  dose  once  the treatment  with the concomitant  medi cation  has completed  and 
all of the restart  criter ia above  are met. 
 
If IP has been  withheld  or missed  for more  than 14 days, the subject  will resume 
dosing  at the starting  dose  level  once  all restart  criteria  are met.

Dose  adjustments  for subjects  receiving  cinacalcet  will be assessed  at each 
weekly visit during  the treatment  period.  The daily dose  of cinacalcet  may only be 
increased  at month ly titration  visits  (week 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24); it can’t  be 
increased  at any other  time during  the treatment  period.  At all weekly visits 
(including  week 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24), the dose  may be maintained,  reduced  or 
withheld based upon  the criteria  in Table  2. 
 
If any of the criteria  for dose  withholding  are met at any time during  the trial, 
including  between scheduled  study visits  (ie, unscheduled),  the dose  of cinacalcet 
is to be withheld  until  all of the following criteria  are met:

• iPTH  is > 150 pg/mL  
 
• Ionized calcium  is > 1.13 mmol/L  
 
• Subject  has no symptoms of hypocalcemia  
 
• Subject  doesn’t  have  any ongoi ng adverse  event(s)  which warrant  withholding

Dose  adjustments  for subjects  receiving  cinacalcet  will be assessed  at each 
weekly visit during  the treatment  period.  The daily dose  of cinacalcet  may only be 
increased  at month ly titration  visits  (week 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24); it can’t  be 
increased  at any other  time during  the treatment  period.  At all weekly visits 
(including  week 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24), the dose  may be maintained,  reduced  or 
withheld based upon  the criteria  in Table  3. 
 
If any of the criteria  for dose  withholding  are met at any time during  the trial, 
including  between scheduled  study visits  (ie, unscheduled),  the dose  of cinacalcet 
is to be withheld  until  all of the following criteria  are met:

• iPTH  is > 150 pg/mL  
 
• Ionized calcium  is > 1.05 mmol/L  
 
• Subject  has no symptoms of hypocalcemia  
 
• Subject  doesn’t  have  any ongoi ng adverse  event(s)  which warrant  withholding 
of cinacalcet.  
 
If a subject  dose  is being  withhel d, ionized calcium  levels should  be assessed 
weekly until an ionized calcium  of ˃1.05 mmol/L  is obtained,  at which point,  cCa 
and iPTH  should  be assessed  by the central  laborato ry. 
 
Once  all the restart  criteria  above  are met, cinacalcet  may be restar ted at one PSD 
below the previous  dose  received.  Subjects  receiving  the lowest PSD (1 mg) who 
require  a dose  reduction  will have their  dose  withheld  until  the criteria  for 
maintaining  or increasing  the dose  are met, at which time they will restart  dosing 
at 1 mg/d ay. 
 
If subjects  require  tempora ry administration  of concomitant  medications  that are 
known to prolong  the QTc interv al, are CYP3A4 inhibitors,  or are CYP2D6 
substrates,  the administration  of IP is to be withheld.  The dose  may be restarted 
at one PSD below the previous  dose  once  the treatment  with the concomitant 
medication  has completed  and all of the restart  criteria  above  are met. 
 
If IP has been  withheld  or missed  for more  than 14 days, the subject  will resume 
dosing  at the starting  dose  level  once  all restart  criteria  are met. 
 
If any of the criteria  for dose  decrease  are met between scheduled  study visits, the 
dose  of cinacalcet  is to be suspended  until  the next visit at which time the dose will 
be decreased  per dose  adjustment  procedures  of that visit.

• Clarified  that subjects who are in Study  20130356  study, the end of study (EOS) 
procedures  for an individual  subject will occur at the same time as the end of 
investigatio nal produ ct (EOIP)  visit for subjects enrolling  in Study  20140159.  
• Clarified  that for subjects enrolled  in Study  20140159  at the time of 20110100  study 
termination,  the 2-week  safety  follow -up period  in 20110100  will not apply for these 
subjects and the EOS  procedures  for an individual  subject will occur at the time as 
the EOIP  visit for subjects enrolling  in Study  20140159.  
• Added  the EOIP  visit in study 20130356  and day 1 in Study  20140159  will be the 
same visit unless there  is an admin istrative delay.  Eligible  subjects will complete 
day 1 of 20140159  assessment s. 
• Clarified  the initial  dose of cinacalcet for eligible  subjects from the cinacalcet arm in 
20130356  who meet  eligibility  on day 1 for Study  20140159.

overlap  with visits in the 20130356  or 20110100  studie s, these will be performed  once at 
the site and applied  to both study visits to minimi ze dupli cate study assessment s, eg, 
20130356  week  19 and 20140159  Screening.  The subject visits and assessments  for 
this study will occur from baseline  through  to the end of study.  Assessments during  this 
study will include:  
 
• Colle ction of blood  samples  for the evaluation  of blood  chemi stry, hemat ology, 
calcium, iPTH, and bone  biomar kers 
• Physical assessments  including  vital signs (ie, blood pressure, heart  rate) 
 
• 12-lead electrocardiogr am (ECG) at baseline  and week  32 (if the subject ends 
the study prior to week  32, the 12-lead ECG  will be performed  at the  last study 
visit) 
• Assessments for symptoms  of hypocalcemia  
 
• Recording  of adverse events, concomitant  medication s, and IP complian ce

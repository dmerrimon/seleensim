Study Design:  This is a Phase 2, double -blind, placebo -controlled, parallel -group, multicenter 
study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics  (PK), and efficacy of 
2 mg and 4 mg SUVN -G3031 compared with  placebo in patients with narcolepsy 
with and without cataplexy. Patients will be randomized at a ratio of 1:1:1 to 2 mg 
SUVN -G3031, 4  mg SUVN -G3031, or placebo. Patient s will be stratified  by at 
least 30% each based on whether they have narcolepsy with or without cataplexy 
(Na-1 or Na -2, respectively ). 
Each patient will receive study drug once  daily, in a tablet formulation, for 
14 days. Enough patients will be screened to enable 114 patients to be enrolled 
(38 per treatment group). A single , unbli nded,  interim analysis will be undertaken 
when approximately 50% of patients have completed 14 days of treatment; this 
analysis will enable sample size re -estimation to occur if appropriate. A maximum 
of 57 additional patients (19 patients per treatment ar m) will be enrolled  to 
generate a total maximum study population of 171 patients . 
Patients, who have provided written informed con sent, will be screened up to 
28 days prior to enrol lment. Eligible patients will complete a  washout period of 
≥ 14 days for al l agents targeting cataplexy and ≥  7 days for all stimulants 
targeting  EDS .  
Sleep diaries will be distributed to eligible patients  during the screening window  
and patients will start to record their sleep evaluations in it immediately. Diary entries will be reviewed at baseline and all subsequent visits.  
Once these washout periods have been completed patients will attend the clinic for randomization and baselin e (Day 0) assessments; patients will provide a blood 
sample for analysis of plasma PK. After  completion of baseline assessments, 
study drug will be dispensed to patients and they will take their first dose the next day (Day 1) ; patients will receive enough  study drug to last until the next visit at 
Day 7. On Day 7 (±1 day) patients will attend the clinic for an outpatient visit, when efficacy and safety assessments will be undertaken. Patients will provide a blood sample for PK analysis at the estimated tro ugh (just prior to dosing) and at 
the estimated maximum plasma concentration of SUVN -G3031 (3 ± 0.5 hours 
postdosing). Patients will be dispensed enough study drug to last until the next 
visit at Day 14. On Day 14 (±1 day) patients will attend the clinic f or an 
outpatient visit, where efficacy and safety assessments will be undertaken. They will provide a sample for PK analysis as per the Day 7 visit.  
A final safety follow -up visit will be performed at Day 21 (±1 day). All visits will 
be outpatient visits a nd patients will be enrolled in the study for a maximum of 
49 days (7 weeks).

16-Aug-2023 This document is confidential.  Page 6 of 79 Selection of Patients : Inclusion Criteria:  
1. Must be between the ages of 18  to 65 years, inclusive.  
2. Have narcolepsy with or without cataplexy (Na -1 or Na -2) based on the 
International Classification of Sleep Disorders (3rd Edition) criteria for the 
diagnosis of narcolepsy  (new or previously diagnosed) . 
3. Have undergone a Multiple Sleep Latency Test ( MSLT) study showing an 
MSLT of ≤ 8 minutes with 2 or more s leep onset rapid eye movement periods 
(SOREMPs ) performed according to standard techniques, with substitution of 
1 of the required SOREMPs on MSLT with 1 obtained from the preceding 
nocturnal PSG, performed at the time of diagnosis. No other potential cause for 
EDS must have been identified during the preceding nocturnal PSG.  If the 
study site is unable to obtain the MSLT diagnoses, the MSLT may be 
performed to confirm diagnoses upon Sponsor and medical monitor approval.  
4. An ESS score of ≥ 12; and mean MWT time of <  12 min utes across the first 
4 sessions at baseline.  An ESS score of ≥ 12 for eligibility is only required at 
the Baseline visit. An ESS score of < 12 at Screening due to concomitant 
medications will be subjected to PI’s discretion for eligibility.  
5. Must have a body mass index ranging from 18 to <  45 kg/m2. 
6. Negative urine drug screen (UDS) at the  Screening and Baseline (Visit 1 ) 
visits.  
• A positive UDS at Screening can be repeated up to Day -1; however, a 
negative UDS is required prior to Day 0 (Baseline visit), and a second 
negative UDS is required on Day 0 (Baseline visit).  
• A positive UDS at Screening due to concomitant medications will be subject to PI’s discretion for eligibility.  
7. All patients  must agree to remain free of alcohol and illicit drugs from 
Screening and until the Safety Follow -up visit . 
8. All male patients who are sexually active and not surgical l
 y sterilized must 
agree to use a condom with or without spermicide, in addition to any birth control used by their partner during the study until 1 month after the final dose of investigational product (IP).  
9. Before randomization, a woman must be either not of childbearing potential or 
of childbear i
ng potential practicing highly effective methods of birth control. 
• “Not of childbearing potent ial” is defined as a patient who is 
postmenopausal (>  45 years of age with amenorrhea for at least 
12 months); permanently sterilized (e.g. , tubal occlusion, hysterectomy, 
bilateral salpingectomy); or otherwise is incapable of pregnancy (due to 
reasons including bilateral blocked fallopian tubes, bilateral oophorectomy, androgen insensitivity syndrome , and Müllerian  agenesis).  
• “Of childbearin g potential” and practicing a highly effective method of 
birth control is defined as a patient following regulations consistent with the use of birth control methods for patients participating in clinical 
studies. A highly effective method of birth control  is a method with low 
user dependency that results in a low failure rate ( i.e., less than 1% per 
year) when used consistently and correctly. Nonexhaustive examples of 
highly effective methods include: e.g. , established use of oral , injected, or 
implanted hormonal methods of contraception; placement of an 
intrauterine device or intrauterine system; barrier methods: condom with 
spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/suppository or occlusive cap (diaphragm or cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/ suppository; 
male partner sterilization (the vasectomized partner should be the sole 
partner for that patient), or male partner is using condoms with spermicide;

Two forms of effective method s of birth control must be used during the 
study and for 1 month after the last dose of IP.  
10. Willingness to complete the study protocol with full compliance with 
procedures and sign an informed consent form.  
Exclusion Criteria:  
1. Habitual wake-u p time after 8 AM as assessed by sleep diary, habitual sleep time 
of < 6 h and habitual bedtime past 1 AM as determined by sleep diary entries.  
2. Use of any investigational therapy within the 30- day period prior to enrollment.  
3. Excessive caffeine (defined as >  600 mg/per day) use at least 1week prior to 
baseline assessments and during the course of the trial.

awakens at night to smoke).  
5. Use of concurrent medications prescribed to treat narcolepsy  or any 
indication  as specified including stimulants, antidepressants and sodium 
oxybate  before Baseline  and until the Safety Follow -up visit . 
6. Current diagnosis of or past treatment for syndromes known to cause sleep 
disruption or any other cause of daytime sleepiness . If Investigator confirms 
that any of the following syndrom es are not clinically significant to the extent 
that it is causing sleep disturbance, this patient may be permitted at the Investigator’s discretion.  
• Obstructive sleep apnea, or individuals requiring continuous positive 
airway pressure (obstructive sleep apnea noted during nocturnal PSG 
should be queried) .  
• Periodic limb movement disorder (periodic limb movements note d 
during nocturnal PSG should be queried ). 
• Other clinically significant disorders which cause sleep disruption ( e.g., 
chronic pain disorder, chronic or untreated insomnia, clinically significant levels of gastroesophageal reflux disease, asthma, neuropathy, or other chronic pain disorders such as osteoarthritis or degenerative joint disease) . 
• Hypothyroidism requires Investigator assessment to determine whether it contributes to interrupted or poor sleep, ( i.e., causing daytime somnolence) . 
• Parasomnias . 
• Significant nocturia . 
7. Clinically significant ECG abnormalities. Patients are excluded with a 
screening ECG PR interval of ≥  300 msec, QRS interval ≥  200 msec , or 
Fridericia's correction of QT interval ≥ 450 msec for men and ≥  470 msec for 
women obtained after 3 -minute rest in a supine position using a digital ECG.  
Abnormal results for ECGs should be repeated once at screening with 
3 consecutive ECG recordings to ensure reproducibility of the abnormality 
before excluding a subject based on the exc lusion criteria. Each ECG 
recording should be taken approximately 5 minutes apart (the ECG result reported would be evaluated at each time point). A subject will be excluded if 
the QTcF is ≥450 msec in men and ≥470 msec in women for 2 of the 3 time 
points of the ECGs done, unless due to ventricular pacing. If only 1 ECG 
time point has a QTcF of ≥450 msec in men and ≥470 msec in women, and 
this is not reproduced at either of the other 2 time points, the subject can be 
included in the trial.  
8. Concurrent use of  sedating agents such as hypnotics, tranquilizers, sedating 
antihistamines,  antipsychotics, benzodiazepines, anticonvulsants, clonidine or

11. Patients with preplanned surgeries requiring general anesthesia throughout the duration of the trial.  
12. Severe, unstable psychiatric illness including a diagnosis of bipolar disorder, 
schizophrenia or psychotic disorder in the patient’s lifetime, according to 
DSM -5 criteria.  Patients with  severe or uncontrolled depression that, in the 
judgment of the Investigator, makes the patient inappropriate for entry into the 
study or which will require new onset of treatment during the course of the 
trial. Subjects who are at significant potential su icidal risk are determined by:  
• Patients who answer “Yes” on the CSSRS Suicidal Ideation Item 4 (active 
suicidal ideation with some intent to act, without specific plan) and whose 
most recent episode meeting criteria for this CSSRS Item 4 occurred within the last 6 months; or

Items (actual attempt, interrupted attempt, aborted attempt, preparatory acts, or behavior) and whose most recent episode meeting criteria for any of these 5 CSSRS Suicidal Behavior Items occurred w ithin the last 
2 years; or  
• Patients who, in the opinion of the Investigator, present a serious risk of 
suicide.  
13. An occupation requiring variable shift work , night shifts , or frequent 
overnight travel which disrupts sleep patterns . 
14. In the opinion of the Investigator, it would be unsafe for a patient to stop 
taking any wake promoting agent for more than 4 weeks. The patient’s 
occupation ( e.g., requirement for driving) may need to be considered.  
Withdrawal Criteria:  • Unacceptable toxic ity or AE.  
• Clinically significant abnormal lab values:  
o Alanine aminotransferase (ALT)  or aspartate aminotransferase

• Lost to follow -up: the patient stopped coming for visits, and study 
personnel were unable to contact the patient.  
• Pregnancy . 
Planned Sample Size:  114 patients (38 per treatment group). This may be increased following a sample 
size re-estimation up to a maximum of 171 patients . 
Investigational Therapy : • 2 mg SUVN -G3031  
• 4 mg SUVN -G3031 
Reference Therapy : Placebo  
Treatment Duration : Each patient  will be dosed for 14 days. The study is expected to last a total of 
13 months.  
Efficacy : Efficacy assessments include MWT, CGI -S, ESS, CGI -C, PGI -C, nocturnal 
overnight PSG, and sleep diary.  
Safety : Safety assessments include vital signs, physical examinations, ECGs, laboratory 
assessments, CSSRS and AEs.  
Pharmacokinetics : Blood  samples  will be collected for analysis of plasma PK . 
Statistical Methods and 
Planned Analyses: Summary tables will be organized by treatment group. Descriptive statistics for 
continuous variables will include number of patients (n), mean, standard deviation , standard error of mean, median, minimum, and maximum, unless 
otherwise noted. Frequency and percentage will be calculated for categorical variables. Unless stated otherwise, all summary tables will present descriptive statistics and/or frequencies by study part and treatment. All data listings will be 
sorted by treatment and patient number. All data collected during the study will be 
analyzed and reported unless stated otherwise.  
The intent -to-treat (ITT) population will include all patients who were 
rando mized, received at least one dose of study drug, and had baseline and at least 
one post -baseline primary  efficacy assessment .  
The Safety  population will include all randomized patients who receive at least 
1 dose of study treatment. This population will b e used for the analysis of safety.  
The Per Protocol (PP) population will be a subset of ITT  population consisting of 
those patients who complete 14 days treatment and had no major protocol 
deviation affecting the primary efficacy variable. All protocol dev iations will be 
assessed and documented on a case- by-case basis before the database lock, and 
deviations considered to have a serious impact on the efficacy results will lead to 
the relevant patient being excluded from the PP set. Before database lock,

5.1 Background on Narcolepsy  
Narcolepsy is a long- term neurological disorder that specifically affects the regulation of 
sleep -wake cycles. The disorder affects males and females equally with symptoms often starting 
in childhood, adolescence, or young adulthood (ages 7 to 25 years). It is estimated t hat anywhere 
from 135,000 to 200,000 people in the United States (US) have narcolepsy 
[National Institute  of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, 2018 ]; however, because the condition 
often goes undiagnosed, the prevalence could be higher. People with narcolepsy are often misdiagnosed with other conditions, such as psychiatric disorders or medical disorders, delaying 
proper diagnosis and treatment for years.  
The cardinal symptom of narcolepsy is excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS)  [Nishino , 2007] . 
Excessive daytime sleepiness is characterized by persistent sleepiness, regardless of night time 
sleep accrual, and is often described as a “sleep attack” where patients experience a sudden and overwhelming sense of sleepiness  [National  Institute  of Neurological  Disorders  and Stroke, 2018] . 
In between sleep attacks, however, patients with narcolepsy experience normal levels of alertness.  
Narcolepsy may be further defined by the presence or absence of cataplexy. Approximately 70% 
of patients with narcolepsy experience cataplexy characterized by recurrent episodes of sudden 
loss of muscle strength accompanied by full conscious awareness  [Wozniak  and Quinell, 2015 ]. 
Narcolepsy with cataplexy (narcolepsy -cataplexy; hypocretin deficiency syndrome) i s referred to 
as Narcolepsy Type 1 ( Na-1). Cataplexy attacks in patients with Na-1 are typically triggered by 
negative and positive emotions [ Calik , 2017] and vary in frequency, character, and severity. 
Severe attacks can result in a total body collapse during which patients are unable to move, speak, or keep their eyes open [ National Institute of Health , 2017]. Narcolepsy without cataplexy 
is referred to as Narcolepsy Type 2 (Na-2).  
Additional symptoms of narcolepsy experienced in both patients with Na -1 and patients with 
Na-2 at differing intensities and frequencies include hypnagogic hallucinations, sleep paralysis, 
and automatic behavior [ Sturzenegg er and Bassetti,  2004] . All symptoms of narcolepsy result in 
a decreased quality of life compared with the general population [ Bogan et al,  2016 ]. A 
biological substrate has been suggested in that Na-1 is caused by a deficiency of hypothalamic 
hypocretin (levels ≤  110 pg/mL). Little is known about the underlying causes of Na-2 
[Baumann et al,2014 ]. However, evidence from a nimal models indicates that deficient orexin 
transmission is involved in the Na -2 pathophysiology. Lack of orexin could be circumvented by 
activating histaminergic neurons.  
Until recently, therapy for narcolepsy  consisted primarily of amphetamines and rela ted 
stimulants, including methylphenidate and dextroamphetamine, to increase alertness and improve daytime performance  [Zwicker , 1995; Smith  et al, 2016]. Although studies show a 
moderate improvement in alertness levels (to approximately 70% of normal individuals), common adverse effects including headaches, nervousness, irritability, tremor, insomnia, 
Suven Life Sciences  CTP2S13031H3 
SUVN -G3031 Version 4.0 Final 
 
16-Aug-2023 This document is confidential.  Page 19 of 79 anorexia, and palpitations, limit utility of these therapies. Additionally, tolerance to the alerting 
effect of these drugs develops in up to 30% of patients using these medications 
[Mitler et  al, 1994]. 
The standard of care for the treatme nt of EDS in patients with narcolepsy is modafinil or its 
enantiomer, armodafinil (although a number of products generally subsumed under the category 
of “stimulants” are available)  [Billiard , 2008] . Chemically distinct and to some extent 
pharmacologically unrelated to other stimulants, modafinil has an improved safety profile and lower abuse potential, compared with  older stimulants; however, it usually does not reduce EDS 
to normal levels [ Wise  et al, 2007 ] and provides no benefit for cataplexy or disrupted nighttime 
sleep, necessitating the use of other drugs for these symptoms. For cataplexy, venlafaxine, 
fluoxetine, clomipramine, and sodium oxybate customarily are employed. 
In 2002, sodium oxybate was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the 
treatment of cataplexy and EDS in adults with narcolepsy (Xyrem
®, Jazz Pharmaceuticals plc.). 
Although the drug has advantages over previously used cataplexy therapies in that it targets both EDS and cataplexy, it requires titration to an optimal dose, and must be administered under a 
Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies mandate in the United S tates through a central 
pharmacy in conjunction with step therapy. Co-administration of sodium oxybate with modafinil was shown to provide improved beneficial effects on EDS compared with  the administration of 
either medication alone, as might be anticipat ed by the mechanisms of action for each agent  
[Black  and Houghton, 2006] . However, a single safe and effective therapeutic agent for the 
treatment of multiple symptoms is still unavailable and would  represent a significant 
advancement in treatment options.  
To address this unmet need, Suven is developing SUVN-G3031, an orally active inverse agonist 
of the human histamine H3 receptors (H3R). Histaminergic neurons are mainly located in the posterior hypothalamus and play a role in arousal mechanisms. It has been demonstrated that the 
H3R inverse agonists a re able to promote activation of cerebral histamine neurons. 
SUVN-G3031 enhances the histaminergic transmissions in brain, acetylcholine release in prefrontal cortex and hippocampus, and dopamine release in prefrontal cortex (but not in 
striatum and nucleus accumben s). 
5.2 Background on SUVN -G3031 
SUVN- G3031 emerges as a potent, selective, oral ly bioavailable, brain- penetrating, H3R -inverse 
agonist with dose-dependent receptor occupancy implicated in the regulation of sleep/wake 
cycles. SUVN -G3031 increased wakefulness in rodents providing the evidence for treatment of 
sleep -related disorders. In rodent models of cognition, a procognitive effect has been 
demonstrated and SUVN-G3031 enhanced neurot ransmitters responsible for procognitive 
properties. In wild type and orexin knockout mice, the selective H3R antagonist GSK189254 increased wakefulness, and decreased slow wave sleep and paradoxical sleep, supportin g the 
potential use of H3R antagonist/inverse agonist for the treatment of narcolepsy in EDS [Guo et al, 2009].

16-Aug-2023 This document is confidential.  Page 20 of 79 5.2.1 Nonclinical Studies  
Six-month oral toxicity studies of SUVN -G3031 in rats, and 9-month o ral toxicity studies in 
dogs have been completed along with genotoxicity, fertility studies in rats, and fetal development 
toxicity studies in rat and rabbit embryo. Overall, the single -dose, repeat -dose, genotoxicity and 
reproduction and developmental toxicity studies completed support conduct of the Investigational New Drug Phase 2 study in patients with narcolepsy at the dosage levels and 
durations of exposures proposed. Clinical observations, with in in vivo models reported , are 
related to the pharmacological effects of this class of compound. These observations, as well as those obtained from regulatory mandated evaluations of safety (cardiovascular, respiratory, and 
central nervous system)  suggest standard methods of surveillance are sufficient at dosage levels 
proposed for clinical use.  
Further information on nonclinical studies can be found in the Investigator’s Brochure. 
5.2.2 Clinical Studies  
The SUVN-G3031 Phase 1 program included 72 healthy volunteers and provided preliminary 
clinical safety and pharmacokinetic (PK) data. SUVN-G3031 was well tolerated in both 
single-dose (up to 20 mg  oral [PO ]) and multiple -dose administrations (up to 6  mg PO for 
14 days). There were no deaths, serious adverse event s (SAEs), or treatment- emergent adverse 
events (TEAEs) leading to discontinuation from the Phase 1 program. The most frequently reported TEAE preferred terms w ere dyssomnia (33.3%) followed by abnormal dreams (27.8%), 
and TEAEs that occurred most frequentl y were in the System Organ Class, Psychiatric 
Disorders . 
A maximum tolerated single dose (20  mg PO) and maximally well tolerated multiple dose s of 
6 mg/day PO for 14 days were established using a sequential dose- escalation paradigm. 
Specifically, no significant changes in safety parameters including laboratory results, physical 
examinations, vital signs, fluid balance, suicidal ideation, and electrocardiogram (ECG) 
parameters were noted. Pharmacokinetic data suggest dose proportionality across a range from 
0.1 mg to 20 mg after  single administration of SUVN -G3031 PO, with the main terminal 
half-life of approximately 23 to 34 hours across dosages evaluated. Multi ple oral administration 
exhibited dose -proportional increases in exposures across 1  mg to 6 mg dose range with steady 
state achieved in approximately 5 days. Approximately 55% to 60% of the administered dose was excreted via the urinary route. Food, gender, and age had no appreciable effect on the PK  
profile of SUVN -G3031. 
SUVN-G3031 may be used adjunctively with a variety of compounds affecting EDS or 
cataplexy in patients with narcolepsy as outlined in the Investigator ’s Brochure. However, 
SUVN-G3031 is being evaluated as a monotherapy in the current protocol and all adjunctively used compounds affecting EDS or cataplexy in patients with narcolepsy are prohibited.  
Further information on clinical studies can be found in the Investigator ’s Brochure.

5.3.1 Risks  
This is the first study to be performe d using SUVN-G3031 in patients with narcolepsy. As such 
there may be risks to the enrolled patients that cannot be identified at this stage. 
Based on clinical trials in healthy subject s, there are no expected adverse reactions. The most 
frequently reported TEAE preferred terms in healthy subject trials  were dyssomnia (33.3%) 
followed by abnormal dreams (27.8%), and the TEAEs that occurred most frequently were in the 
System Organ Class, Ps ychiatric Disorders.  
5.3.2 Benefits  
Due to the short treatment period in this study (14 days), patients are unlikely to experience any 
benefit from enrollment in this study. However, results from this study will be used to advance 
the development of SUVN-G3031; therefore,  potentially benefitting this population in the future.

7.1 Description of Overall Study De sign and Plan  
This is a Phase 2, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicenter study to evaluate 
the safety, tolerability, PK , and efficacy of 2 mg and 4 mg SUVN-G3031 compared with  placebo 
in patients with narcolepsy with and without cataplexy. Patients will be randomized at a ratio of 1:1:1 to 2 mg SUVN-G3031, 4 mg  SUVN-G3031, or placebo. Patient s will be stratified by at 
least 30% each based on whether they have narcolepsy with or without cataplexy (Na-1 or Na-2, 
respectively).  
Each patient will receive study drug once daily, in a tablet formulation, for 14 days. Sufficient patients will be screened to enable 114 patients to be enrolled (38 per treatment gro up). Further 
details on the sample size calculations can be found in Section 14.1. A single, unbli nded, interim 
analysis will be undertaken when approximately 50% of patients have completed 14 days of 
treatment; this analysis will enable sample size re -estimation to occur if appropriate. A maximum 
of 57 additional patients (19 patients per treatment arm) will be enrolled to generate a total 
maximum study population of 171 patients. Further details  on the interim analysis  can be found 
in Section 14.6. 
Patients will be enrolled at approxi mately 65 sites in the U nited States and Canada . It is anticipated 
that it will take 12 months to complete enrollment  and 13 months to complete the entire study. 
A study schematic can be seen in Figure  1.

16-Aug-2023 This document is confidential.  Page 26 of 79 7.1.1 Screening  
Patients who have provided written informed consent will be screened up to 28 days before  
enrollment. Eligible  patients will complete a washout period of ≥  14 days for all agents targeting 
cataplexy and ≥  7 days for all stimulants target ing EDS.  
7.1.2 Dosing Period 
Once these washout periods have been completed, patients will attend the clinic for 
randomization and baseline (Day 0) assessments ; patients will provide a blood sample for PK 
analysis. After  completion of baseline (Day 0) assessments, study drug will be dispensed to 
patients and they will take their first dose the next day  (Day 1) ; patients will receive enough 
study drug to last until the next visit at Day 7. On Day 7 (±1 day), patients will attend the clinic for an outpatient visit, when efficacy and safety assessments will be undertaken . Patients will 
provide a blood sample for PK analysis at the estimated trough (just prior to dosing) and at the estimated maximum plasma concentration of SUVN -G3031 (3 ± 0.5 hours postdosing). P atients 
will be dispensed enough study drug to last until the next visit at Day 14. On Day 14 (±1 day), patients will attend the clinic for an outpatient visit, where efficacy and safety assessments will 
be undertaken. They will provide a sample for P K analysis as per the Day 7 visit.  
7.1.3 Safety Follow-up 
A final safety follow -up visit will be performed at Day 21 (±1 day). All visits will be outpatient 
visits and patients will be enrolled in the study for a maximum of 49 days (7 weeks) from the 
start of the screening period. 
7.1.4 Data Monitoring Committee  
The data monitoring committee (DMC) will be established and the charter, composition, and 
methods of analysis and review will be presented separately prior to study initiation.  
 
 
 
7.2 Discussion of Study Design  
7.2.1 Eligibility Criteria  
The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the impact of SUVN -G3031 on EDS associated 
with narcolepsy in adult patients aged 18 to 65 years. Patients must present with an established 
diagnosis of Na-1 or Na -2 to be considered eligible for enrollment consistent with the American 
Academy of Sleep Medicine, International Classification of Sleep Disorders, 3
rd Edition. The 
randomization is not constrained upon subtype, although stratification based upon the diagnosis of Na -1 or Na -2 is included. 
As the primary objective of this study is to evaluate the impact of SUVN -G3031 on EDS 
associated with narcolepsy, minimum thresholds of severity of EDS will be required. The 
minimum threshold of severity of EDS will be defined using key eligibility criteria of MWT

16-Aug-2023 This document is confidential.  Page 27 of 79 mean time of <  12 minutes  across the first 4 sessions at baseline [ Schwartz et al,  2004 ] and ESS 
score of ≥  12 [Szakacs et al, 2017 ]. 
Patients with Na -1 must have a documented history of irrepressible need to sleep or daytime 
lapses into sleep for at least 3 months, and the presence of cataplexy with previously confirmed 
Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT) ≤8 minutes with 2 or more sleep onset rapid eye movement 
periods (SOREMPs) performed according to standard techniques. Substitution of 1 of the 
required SOREMPs on MSLT with 1 obtained from the preceding nocturnal PSG , obtained at the 
time of diagnosis, is permitted. Alternatively, previously obtained cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) hypocretin-1 concentrations may also be used to support the diagnosis in the absence of clinical 
cataplexy assuming acceptable MSLT findings [ Scammell, 2003]. 
Compliance with a uniform operational definition of cataplexy is not mandated by protocol because cataplexy phenotype and frequency may differ widely across patients [ Pillen  et al, 2017 ] 
(frequent attacks of collapse,  sporadic partial attacks, etc)  and because modification of cataplexy 
after pharmacotherapy is not a principal hypothesis of the study. 
Patients with Na -2 must have a comparable history of irrepressible need to sleep or daytime 
lapses into sleep for at least 3 months, identical criteria based upon MSLT and nocturnal PSG , 
but do not have a clinical history of cataplexy or data based upon CSF hypocretin-1 
concentrations which are incompatible with the diagnosis. For both conditions, eligibility criteria 
mimic those frequently associated with interventional studies in  narcolepsy and reduce 
diagnostic confounders related to medical condition such as obstructive sleep apnea, and psychiatric disorders including chronic fatigue syndrome, depression, bipolar affective disorder, 
malingering, and substance use disorder. Idiopathic hypersomnia must be excluded by the 
pre-existing diagnostic evaluation [ Broughton et al, 1997]. 
SUVN-G3031 in this study is being evaluated as a monotherapy; patients will require washout 
from current narcolepsy therapies for both EDS and cataplexy. Washout period will occur within 
a maximum 28- day screening period to allow for minimum drug free period of ≥  7 days for all 
stimulants targeting EDS, and ≥  14 days for all agents targeting cataplexy prior to randomization 
and baseline assessments. The 28 -day screening period allow s a window of drug withdraw to be 
completed safely at the discretion of the Investigator.

7.2.2.1 Primary Outcome Measure 
The primary objective pivots upon changes in EDS in patients with Na-1 and Na-2. The primary 
outcome measure, the change in total ESS scores from baseline, is used to derive the primary 
dependent variable. A successful study requires demonstration of a statistically significant difference between treatment groups based upon the ESS as a single primary endpoint, using a 
prespecified anal ytic model and an intent-to-treat (ITT) dataset.  
The ESS consists of 8 questions chosen on a priori grounds to represent activities with a wide range of different somnificities . 
Suven Life Sciences  CTP2S13031H3 
SUVN -G3031 Version 4.0 Final 
 
16-Aug-2023 This document is confidential.  Page 28 of 79 The ESS is a self -administered questionnaire wherein  respondents are asked to rate on a 4-point 
scale (0 –3) their usual chances of dozing off or falling asleep while engaged in 8 different 
activities (see Section 11.3). It is important that participants answer every question, as there is no 
method for interpolating item scores and a missed question results in an invalid test. Most people 
engage in the activities in the test at least occasionally, although  not necessarily every day. The 
recall period for the test ask s subjects to rate experiences taking place “ in recent times, ” which is 
purposefully vague and is meant to represent a few weeks to a few month s. Within the study , the 
ESS will be completed week ly, consistent with the recall period. The ESS sco re (the sum of 
8 item scores, 0 –3) can range from 0 to 24. The higher the ESS score, the higher the person’ s 
average sleep propensity in daily life , or their “ daytime sleepiness. ” The questionnaire takes no  
more than 2 or 3 minutes to answer. The ESS can be interpreted per the bullets below: 
• 0 to 5 Lower Normal Daytime Sleepiness  
• 6 to 10 Higher Normal Daytime Sleepiness  
• 11 to 12 Mild EDS  
• 13 to 15 Moderate EDS  
• 16 to 24 Severe EDS  
In contrast to other sleep scales, the ESS has been designed to use the questions above based on subject reports to determine sleep propensity or EDS [ Johns, 2000]. As a result, the test can 
measure a subject ’s high sleep propensity or history of dozing in situations that are low soporific 
in nature and during which normal subjects would be unlikely to fall asleep [ Johns, 2000; 
Herring et al, 2013; Van der Heid et al, 2015; Weaver et al, 2020]. Furthermore, a recent publication emphasized that ESS could be a reliable measure to evaluate daytime sleepiness in 
clinical trials with histamine 3 receptor antagonists [Inoue et al, 2022 ]. Thus, the ESS is a useful 
test to determine improvement in sleep propensity in patients with narcolepsy treated with targeted therapeutic agents.   
7.2.2.2 Secondary Outcome Measures  
The secondary measures include the change from baseline in the clinician -derived C GI-S related 
to EDS  [Dauvilliers  et al, 2013; Szakacs et al, 2017] and the change in MWT  score from 
baseline. Appropriate methods for control of multiplicity will be employed for analysis of 
secondary endpoints  (see Section 14.3.2).  
7.2.2.2.1 Clinical Global Impression of Severity  
The CGI was developed for use in National Institute of Mental Health -sponsored clinical studies 
to provide a brief, stand -alone assessment of the clinician ’s view of the patient ’s global 
functioning prior to and after initiating a study medication. The CGI provides an overall clinician -determined summary measure that takes into account all available information, 
including a knowledge of the patient’ s history, psychosocial circumstances, symptoms, behavior, 
and the impact  of the symptoms on the patient’ s ability to function. In all of its applications, it 
Suven Life Sciences  CTP2S13031H3 
SUVN -G3031 Version 4.0 Final 
 
16-Aug-2023 This document is confidential.  Page 29 of 79 functions as a corroborating “clinically relevant” assessment of disease severity, independently 
of as sessments which are more specific to the disease under evaluation.  
The CGI can be completed in less than a minute, captures clinical impressions and can track clinical progress across time. It is administered by an experienced clinician who is familiar with 
the disease and the potential impact of treatment. The CGI rater can make an expert clinical 
global judgment about the severity of the illness across various time points within the context of 
that clinical experience  [Busner and Targ um, 2007]. The C GI has 2 established components, the 
CGI-S, which rates illness severity, and the CGI-C, which rates change from the initiation 
(baseline) of treatment. Both measures have been employed in the evaluati on of investigational 
therapeutic agents for treatment of narcolepsy and both  will be used within this  proposed study. 
The CGI -S within this protocol will be used to rate the severity of the patient ’s illness related to 
EDS symptoms, on a 7-point scale [ Busner and Targum, 2007 ].These ratings are based on the 
clinician’s experience of patient ’s suffering from the same condition  [Berk  et al, 2008 ]. This 
scale has classically been utilized in clinical research of a number of indications to observe and report average symptoms, behavior, and function over a 7-day period [ Busner  and Targum,  2007 ], 
in essence amalgamating the totality of a patient ’s presentation into 1 score based upon 
physician’s judgments of clinical severity. Within this study, the CGI- S assessments will be 
based on sever ity related to EDS rather than on the totali ty of the disease [ Szakacs et al, 2017; 
Dauvilliers  et al, 2013 ]. 
7.2.2.2.2 Maintenance of Wakefulness Test  
The MWT is a common test used to measure latency to sleep onset/daytime somnolence/wakefulness  [Doghramji et al, 1997 ; Black and Houghton, 2006].  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 In general, 
the MWT has been extensively used for the clinical evaluation of sleep latency both in normal 
subjects as well as in patients with disease states such as narcolepsy, EDS, and obstructive sleep 
apnea.

7.2.2.3 E
xploratory Outcome Measures  
Given the need for hypothesis generation, exploratory measures have been included 
acknowledging that neither the patient phenotype, sample size, nor the duration of exposure may 
be adequate for definitive biostatistical contrasts. Exploratory measures include the evaluation of 
associated features of narcolepsy through a sleep diary (sleep attacks, severe sleepiness, cataplexy attacks, hypnagogic or hypnopompic hallucinations, sleep paralysis, noc turnal 
awakening, and nocturnal sleep time – all presented descriptively) , changes in nocturnal 
overnight PSG, subjective assessments of EDS obtained through the ESS as an operationally 
defined responder analysis , CGI -C, and PGI-C.  
Additionally, exploratory analyses evaluate the impact of treatment on symp toms of EDS within 
each of the 4 MWT sessions within a single day (Day 7, Day 14). Specifically, the  
MWT will be performed after a nocturnal overnight PSG at baseline prior to the first dose of study medication, Day 7 (Visit 2), and Day 14 (Visit 3) according to validated standards. The 
first MWT  session  will occur at approximately 2 hours after awakening .  
There is no attempt to evaluate the occurrence of a discontinuation phenomenon at the end of double -
blind treatment given the duration of the study and the pharmacological properties of SUVN -G3031 
either through self -assessments, or clinician -based interview  [Dauvilliers  et al, 2013 ]. However, the 
occurrence of 2 AESIs during therapy, described as vivid and unpleasant dreams and difficulty 
initiating or maintaining sleep , will be monitored (see Section 12.7.2).  
7.2.2.3.1 Clinical Global Impression of Change  
The CGI -C will be used in this study to evaluate patient improvement related to EDS symptoms. 
The CGI -C is used by the physician to compare change in the patient’s clinical condition at each 
visit after initiation of treatment to an established baseline taken prior to study treatment. The 
CGI-C is based on a 7 -point scale, where at each visit the physician will rate the change from 
baseline [ Busner  and Targum, 2007]. Within this study, the CGI- C assessment will be based on 
change observed from baseline related to EDS . 
7.2.2.3.2 Nocturnal Overnight Polysomnography 
Although PSG is not always required during the evening prior to an MWT assessment, it has been used to objectively demonstrate a lack of sleep disruption by residual effects of test product 
and is commonly used before MWT testing within the narcolepsy literature. For example, 
Harsh  et al (2006)  used PSG variables that  included latency to persistent sleep in minutes ( time 
from lights out to the first of 3 consec utive epoch of stage 1 sleep, or 1 epoch of any other sleep 
stage), number of arousals, number of awakenings, sleep efficiency, total sleep time in minutes, 
wake after sleep onset (WASO) in minutes, percentage of time in stage 1, 2, 3, 4, rapid eye 
movemen t (REM ) sleep percentage, and REM sleep latency in minutes. Similarly, the US

minutes; sleep efficiency ; percentage (sleep time/time in bed) ; percentage of time in s tages 1, 2, 
3, 4; REM ; sleep latency, minutes; REM latency, minutes; and periodically movements during 
sleep (N)  [US Modafinil in Narcolepsy Multicenter Study Group, 2000]. 
7.2.2.3.3 Patient Global Impression  
The Patient Global Impression (PGI) is a self -assessed, single -item questionnaire typically with a 
7-point Likert- type scale a patient can select. There are 2 versions: a PGI- S to measure 
impression of disease severity at a single point i n time, and a PGI- C to measure improvement or 
change based on a baseline state. For the proposed investigation, the PGI-C will be employed. 
The patient will be asked to address the totality of experience on study medication, without 
attempts to demarcate b etween excessive daytime somnolence and cataplexy. The PGI -C has 
categories regarding the condition being measured, from 1 (very much better) to 7 (very much worse).  
The PGI -C is a simple, direct, easy -to-use scale that is intuitively understandable to pa tients. The 
improvement scale aims to evaluat e all aspects of patient ’s health and determin e if there has been 
an improvement or not compared with  a point in time. Customarily, this is the pretreatment 
(baseline) condition of the patient prior to administr ation of study medication. Although it is 
generally used as a global assessment, the measure can be tailored to discrete symptoms within a 
clinical condition. The patient selects 1 response from the options that gives the most accurate 
description of his/h er overall state of health.  
The test -retest reliability of the PGI-C was found to be excellent based on Cronbach’ s alpha 
analysis of responses (0.849) at 6 months and 1 year in women undergoing surgery for urogenital 
prolapse [ Srikrishna  et al, 2010]. The P GI-C has been utilized as often as weekly in a number of 
indications [ Ruoff et al, 2016]. 
The PGI has historical precedent for use in narcolepsy trials. A survey of 35 interventional studies in narcolepsy since 1994 suggests that approximately 3% employed a PGI rating of 
change as a primary or secondary outcome measure. For example, the PGI-C was a secondary 
endpoint in a P hase 2b study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of JZP -110 on wakefulness and 
sleepiness in adults with narcolepsy  [Ruoff et al, 2016]. The PGI -C was administered at 1, 2, 4, 
6, 8, and 12 weeks, with the evaluation anchored to baseline condition. Significant benefits of 
JZP-110 relative to placebo were observed on the PGI- C as early as 1 week after treatment.  
7.2.2.3.4 Sleep Diary  
A sleep diary can be designed to document across a variety o f associated signs or symptoms in 
narcolepsy: from time spent asleep to how many cataplectic attacks occur each day and how they 
manifest themselves. Subjects are generally instructed to try to keep track of the day’ s events 
with notes and to fill out the diary regularly, at minimum once daily, and data can be captured electronically or on paper.  
Suven Life Sciences  CTP2S13031H3 
SUVN -G3031 Version 4.0 Final 
 
16-Aug-2023 This document is confidential.  Page 32 of 79 There is no single standard for the structure of a sleep diary. Review of existing literature 
indicates considerable heterogeneity in the signs/symptoms associated with narcolepsy which 
have been assessed, consistent with hypotheses and patient populations evaluated. The sleep 
diary used by the Harvard  Medical School – Division of Sleep Medicine will be used in this 
study. Further details can be found in Section  11.7. 
A 2017 study analyzed how many nights of sleep diary entries were required for reliable 
estimates of 5 sleep -related outcomes (bedtime, wake time, SOL, sleep duration, and WASO) in 
adolescents. Participants completed a pencil and paper sleep diary across 1 week during the school term. Variables included bedtime (“Went to bed last night at”), SOL ( “Minutes until fell 
asleep”), sleep duration (“Slept this much last night”), WASO (“After you fell asleep, what is the total amount of time you spent awake during any nighttime awakenings?”), and wake time 
(“Finally woke at”). For each item, adolescents were instructed to answer with a specific time 
(e.g., 9:35 pm) or duration (e.g., 12 minutes). Participants also concurrently wore wrist 
actigraph s (Mini -motionlogger; Ambulatory Monitoring Inc. [Ardsley, NY] ) and called a 
time-stamped answering machine before bedtime and after they woke each day  
[Short et  al, 2017]. 
A 2010 paper discussed the development of an online sleep diary. It included bedtime, time the subject went to bed, time they settled for sleep, and an estimate of how long it took them to go to 
sleep. It also included wake time, time to get out of bed, number of awakenings during the night, 
and estimated time awake. It also included checkboxes for reasons the subject awoke, and 
whether anything kept them awake. Finally, it evaluated sleep quality by asking subjects how 
they felt on a 4-point scale and their mood on a 4-point scale [ Blake and Kerr,  2010]. 
A 2012 study compared sleep diaries from an expert panel of 25 attendees of a Pittsburgh Assessment Conference. A smaller subset of experts formed a committee and reviewed the compiled diaries. Items deemed essential were included in a core sleep diary, and those deemed 
optional were retained for an expanded diary. Essential elements of the sleep diary included 
metrics to assess nightly SOL,  WASO, total sleep time , total time spent in bed, sleep efficiency 
(i.e., the percent of the time asleep out of amount of time spent in bed), and sleep quality or satisfaction, which reflects a subj ective  global appraisal of each night’ s sleep.  
Three versions of sleep diaries were created. The core Consensus Sleep Diary (CSD) contained 9 items considered by the workgroup to represent the most critical parameters. The questions ask 
about: (1) the time  of getting into bed; (2) the time at which the individual attempted to fall 
asleep; (3) SOL ; (4) number of awakenings; (5) duration of awakenings; (6) time of final 
awakening; (7) final rise time; (8) perceived sleep quality (rated via Likert scale); and (9) an 
additional space for open-ended comments from the respondent. As previously agreed upon, the core CSD was formatted so that 1 week of nightly sleep data could be recorded on a single diary 
page. The CSD instructions included general information, such as what to do if the respondent 
missed  recording on a particular day, and item- specific instructions to enhance likelihood of 
correct item interpretation. For example, the instructions for item #6 tell the respondent to record 
Suven Life Sciences  CTP2S13031H3

16-Aug-2023 This document is confidential.  Page 33 of 79 the time of the final awakening in the morning. The additional instructions indicate that all items 
are to be completed in the morning within 1 hour of getting out of bed. 
The expanded CSD for morning included a number of optional items that could be completed in 
the morning upon arising. These include additional items about early (pr emature) morning 
awakenings , estimated total sleep time, Likert scale rating of the refreshing quality of sleep, 
napping/dozing, and alcohol, caffeine, and medication use. The instructions for the additi onal 
questions also stipulate that the diary should be completed in the morning. 
Finally, the expanded CSD for evening included the same items as the morning version, but with 
instructions for morning and evening completion. The morning and evening items a re grouped 
separately. The instructions stipulated that items about daytime activity such as caffeine, alcohol, and medication use or napping which appeared on 1 side of the diary are to be completed at night 
before going to bed, while the remaining items which appeared on the other side and query about 
the previous night's sleep are to be completed the next morning [ Carney  et al, 2012 ]. 
Sleep diaries have been used extensively in narcolepsy trials. A survey of 35 interventional studies in narcolepsy since 1994 suggests that approximately 46% employed a sleep diary as a 
primary or secondary outcome measure. For example, a 4-week, double-blind, randomized, 
placebo -controlled trial evaluated time to response with sodium oxybate for the treatment of 
EDS and cataplexy in patients with narcolepsy. There were 102 patients who received sodium oxybate and 34 who received placebo. Clinical response information included the number of 
cataplexy attacks recorded by patients in a daily diary. Cataplexy responder was defined as a 
patient with≥  50% reduction from baseline in weekly cataplexy attacks. Results showed an 
approximately 50% reduction from baseline in weekly cataplexy attacks was the median change after 2  weeks of treatment with sodium oxybate [ Bogan et al, 2015]. 
The sleep diary from Harvard Medic al School – Division of Sleep Medicine will be used in this 
study to evaluate nightly sleep parameters throughout the duration of the study as indicated in the Schedule of Assessments (Table  1).  
Sleep diaries will be distributed to eligible patients during the screening window and patients will start to record their sleep evaluations in it immediately. Diary entries will be reviewed at 
baseline and all  subsequent visits. 
7.2.2.3.5 Columbia  Suicide Severity Scale  
The CSSRS is a rating scale addressing suicide ideation and behavior. Questions assess ideation from a “wish to be dead” to “ active suicidal ideation with specific plan and intent and 
behaviors”. Questions assessing behavior rate it from “ actual attempt” to “completed suicide”. 
The trial will employ 2 distinct CSSRS  forms: The Baseline -Screening version assesses lifetime 
prevalence of suicidal ideation and suicidal behavior, and the Since Last Vi sit form assesses 
ideation and behavior that have emerged since the last study visit. 
The CSSRS has been shown to demonstrate good convergent and divergent validity with other 
multi-informant suicidal ideation and behavior scales and had high sensitivity and specificity for

for patient s participating in clinical studies. A highly effective method of birth control is 
a method with low user dependency that results in a low failure rate ( i.e., less than 1% per 
year) when used consistently and correctly. Nonexhaustive examples of highly effective methods include: e.g., established use of oral , injected, or implanted hormonal methods 
of contraception; placement of an intrauterine device or intrauterine system; barrier methods: condom with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/suppository or occlusive cap 
(diaphragm or cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/suppository; 
male partner sterilization (the vasectomized partner should be the sole partner for that 
patient ), or male partner is using condoms with spermicide; practicing true abstinence

7. Clinically significant ECG abnormalities. Patients are excluded with a screening ECG PR interval of ≥  300 msec, QRS interval ≥  200 msec , or Fridericia’s correction of QT interval 
≥ 450 mse c for men and ≥  470 msec for women obtained after 3- minute rest in a supine 
position using a digital ECG. Abnormal results for ECGs should be repeated once at 
screening with 3 consecutive ECG recordings to ensure reproducibility of the abnormality before excluding a subject based on the exclusion criteria. Each ECG recording should be 
taken approximately 5 minutes apart (the E CG result reported would be evaluated at each 
time point). A subject will be excluded if the QTcF is ≥  450 msec in men and ≥  470 msec in 
women for 2 of the 3 time points of the ECGs done, unless due to ventricular pacing. If only 
1 ECG time point has a QTc F of ≥  450 msec in men and ≥  470 msec in women, and this is 
not reproduced at either of the other 2 time points, the subject can be included in the trial.

Individuals who sign the ICF to participate in the study but who do not subsequently meet all the requirements as outlined in the inclusion and exclusion criteria and therefore do not enroll 
(screen failures ) may be rescreened on a case -by-case basis after  approval of the Sponsor. 
8.4 Study Withdrawal, Removal, and Replacement of Patients  
If a patient discontinues study treatment and is withdrawn from the study for any reason, the study site must immediately notify the medical monitor. The date and the reason for study 
discontinuation must be recorded on the electronic case report form (eCRF ). Patients who 
complete or discontinue early from the study will be asked to return to the study site within 7 days of the last administration of study drug to complete the safety follow -up assessments as 
indicated in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table  1). 
Patients who want to discontinue early from the study (i.e., at the next visit), or who make a 
decision to withdraw during a scheduled visit, and who remain on study drug should complete

follow -up assessments according to the Schedule of Assessments ( Table  1). 
In the event that a patient discontinues prematurely from the study b ecause of a TEAE or serious 
TEAE, the TEAE or serious TEAE will be followed until it resolves (returns to normal or 
baseline values) or stabilizes, or until it is judged by the Investigator to no longer be clinically 
significant.  
Once a patient is withdraw n from the study, the patient may not re -enter the study. Care of the 
patient will return to their usual doctor. 
A patient may voluntarily withdraw or be withdrawn from the study at any time for reasons 
including, but not limited to, the following: 
• Unacceptable toxicity or AE . 
• Clinically significant abnormal lab values : 
o Alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) or aspartate aminotransfe rase ( AST ) ≥ 8x upper 
limit of normal (ULN) ;  
o ALT or AST ≥ 3x ULN and total bilirubin ≥ 2x ULN at the same visit;  
o ALT or AST ≥ 3x ULN with the appearance of symptoms indicating hepatitis (e.g., worsening fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper quadrant pain or tenderness, fever, 
rash, or eosinophilia).  
• QT syndrome, Fridericia’s formula corrected QT (QTcF) interval ≥ 470 ms (for male 
subjects) or ≥ 480 ms (for female subjects), or torsades de pointes . Abnormal results for 
ECGs should be confirmed with repea t ECG recordings to ensure reproducibility of the 
abnormality before  withdrawing the subject from the study.  
• A positive urinary drug screen at any visit. 
• Patient  withdrawal of consent: at any time, a patient’s  participation in the study may be 
terminate d at his/her request or on the basis of the Investigator ’s clinical judgment.  The 
reason for patient  withdrawal will be noted on the e CRF . 
• Intercurrent illness:  a condition, injury, or disease unrelated to the pr imary diagnosis that 
became apparent during treatment and necessitated the patient’ s termination from the 
study. 
• General or specific changes in the patient’s  condition that renders him/her ineligible for 
further treatment according to the inclusion/exclusion criteria . 
• Patient  fails to adhere to the protocol requirements (e.g., drug noncompliance, failure to 
return for defined number of visits). 
• Lost to follow -up: the patient stopped coming for visits, and study personnel were unable 
to contact the patient.

9.1 Details of Study Treatments  
The study treatments to be used in this study are: 
• 2 mg SUVN -G3031 
• 4 mg SUVN -G3031 
• Placebo  
All study treatment supplies to be used in this study will be provided by the Sponsor. 
Study treatment is provided in high density polyethylene (HDPE) bottles containing 10 tablets. 
Each bottle will contain the patient identification number, the name and address of the Sponsor, 
and any other information required by local regulations. Study treatment supplies should be 
stored in accordance with United States Pharmacopeia ( USP) Controlled Room Temperature 
(20–25°C [68–77°F] with excursions permitted between 15 and 30°C [59–86°F]). Further 
information is provided in the Pharmacy Manual. 
9.2 Dosage Schedule  
Patients should take 1 tablet per day in the morning, as soon as they wake up, with 
approximately 250 mL water. Dosing may occur with or without food. Patients will be dosed for 
14 days. 
If a patient forgets to take their morning dose and remembers before 1:00 PM, then they should 
take it as soon as they remember. If a patient for gets to take their morning dose and remembers 
after 1:00 PM, then they should skip the day’s dose and take the next scheduled dose the next 
morning. If the patient has missed more than 1 dose , then they should only take the most recent 
forgotten dose. 
9.3 Measures to Minimize Bias: Study Treatment  Assignmen t and Blinding  
9.3.1 Method of Study Treatment Assignment  
Patients will be randomized to the 3 study treatments in a 1:1:1 ratio. This randomization will be 
stratified  by at least  30%  each based on whether they have narcolepsy with or without cataplexy 
(Na-1 or Na-2), respectively. 
Patients will be randomized using an interactive response technology (I RT). The randomization 
number generated should be entered into the eCRF. Further details will be provided in the 
Pharmacy Manual.  
9.3.2 Blinding  
This is a double-blind study. Tablets will be provided, pre-dispensed in blinded study kits. All tablets will be identical in appearance and size . 
According to the randomization schedule as indicated in the Schedule of Assessments  (Table  1) 
and in accordance with the Pharmacy Manual, the Investigator or designee will obtain the kit 
Suven Life Sciences  CTP2S13031H3 
SUVN -G3031 Version 4.0 Final 
 
16-Aug-2023 This document is confidential.  Page 42 of 79 number from the IRT for the patient and the kit number will be provided to the blinded 
pharmacist or designee at the study center who is responsible for the preparation of study drug. 
The blinded pharmacist will then dispense the correct kit number to the patient.  
Each patient will receive 2 kits : the first for Day s 1 to 7 and the second for Days 8 to 14. The kits 
numbers should be recorded in the eCRF and in the pharmacy dispensing logs. 
If an Investigator becomes unblinded to a given patient ’s study treatment that patient will be 
discontinued from the study unless there are ethical reasons for that patient not to be 
discontinued; approval from the Sponsor’s medical monitor must be obtained in such instances. 
In the event that emergency unblinding is required for a given pat ient because of  AEs or 
concerns for the patient ’s safety  or wellbeing, the Investigator may break the randomization code 
for the patient  via the IRT, by which system the unblinding will be captured. The Investigator is 
responsible for notifying the medical monitor and /or Sponsor of such an event as soon as 
possible. The unblinding and its cause will also be documented in the eCRF. 
9.4 Dosage Modification 
No dose modification is permitted during this study. 
9.5 Treatment  Accountability and  Compliance  
The pharmacist or other designated individual will maintain records of study treatment delivered 
to the study site, the inventory at the study site , the distribution to and use by each patient  and the 
return of any required materials to the Sponsor. Study sit es will be responsible for disposal  of 
study treatment. Records should include dates, quantities, batch/serial numbers, expiration dates, 
in-clinic temperature log, and unique code numbers assigned to the product and study patients.  
At each visit after initiation of treatment, study site personnel will record compliance of the 
patient  with the patient’s assigned regimen. Patients  will be instructed to bring their diaries and 
unused/partially used/empty bottles back for inspection at each study visit. P atients  are to be 
reminded of the importance of compliance with their assigned regimen, with an emphasis on taking their study drug on schedule and maintaining the prescribed interval between doses. 
Investigators will maintain records that adequately document that the patients  were provided 
with the correct study treatment kits and reconcile the products received from the drug 
dispensing center. Investigational product will not be disposed until accountability has been fully 
monitored.  
Medication containers must be returned at each visit, as compliance will be assessed by tablet 
counts. Noncompliance is defined as taking less than < 80% or more than 120%  of study drug 
during any outpatient evaluation period (visit to visit). Discontinuation for noncompliance is at the Investigator’s discretion and is to be noted on the e CRF.

The Schedule of Assessments (Table  1) outlines the efficacy assessments to be performed 
throughout the study and their timing. 
11.1 Maintenance of Wakefulness Test  
The MWT will be utilized within this study and will be performed following a 
nocturnal overnight PSG at the times outlined in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table  1). The 
MWT will begin at approximately 2 hours a fter awakening (4 total MWT sessions will be 
performed at 2 -hour intervals) . Patients will be required to recline in a quiet, dimly lit bedroom 
and instructed to remain awake for as long as possible. The MWT trial will be stopped after the 
onset of sleep or after  if sleep did not occur. The onset of sleep will be evaluated 
using a standard PSG montage and defined as 3 consecutive 30- second epochs of stage 1 sleep or 
30 seconds of sleep stage 2, 3, 4, or REM  sleep.  
11.2 Clinical Global Impression of Se verity  
The CGI -S will be used to rate the severity of the patient ’s illness related to EDS symptoms, on a 
7-point scale, which includes the following gradations: 1 = normal, not at all ill; 2  = borderline 
ill; 3 = mildly ill; 4  = moderately ill; 5  = marked ly ill; 6  = severely ill; 7  = among the most 
extremely ill. These ratings should be based on the clinician’s experience of patients suffering 
from the same condition . The ratings should be completed by the same physician for each patient 
throughout the study in order to maintain consistency. 
11.3 Epworth Sleepiness Scale  
The ESS consists of 8 questions in which the patient will be asked “How likely are you to doze 
off or fall asleep in the following situations, in contrast to feeling just tired?”  
• Sitting and reading  
• Watching television  
• Sitting, inactive in a public place (e.g. , a theatre or a meeting)  
• As a passenger in a car for an hour without a break  
• Lying down to rest in the afternoon when circumstances permit  
• Sitting and talking to someone  
• Sitting quietly after a lunch without alcohol  
• In a car, while stopped for a few minutes in traffic  
Patients will be asked to respond to each question with a score of 0–3 where: 
• 0 = would never doze 
• 1 = slight chance of doz ing 

Suven Life Sciences  CTP2S13031H3 
SUVN -G3031 Version 4.0 Final 
 
16-Aug-2023 This document is confidential.  Page 51 of 79 • 2 = moderate chance of dozing  
• 3 = high chance of doz ing 
The ESS will be completed by the patients themselves.  
11.4 Clinical Global Impression of Change  
The CGI -C is used by the physician to compare change in the patient’s clinical condition at each 
visit after initiation of treatment to an established baseline taken prior to study treatment.  
The CGI -C is based on a 7 -point scale, where at each time point the physician will rate the 
change from baseline using the following query: “Compared to the patient's condition at 
admission to the project [prior to medication initiation], this patient's condition is: 1  = very much 
improved since the initiation of treatment; 2  = much improved; 3 = minimally improved; 4  = no 
change from baseline (the initiation of treatment); 5  = minimally worse; 6  = much worse; 
7 = very much worse since the initiation of treatment.”  Within this study, the CGI- C assessment 
will be based on change observed from baseline related to EDS rather than on the totality of the disease.  
The ratings should be completed by the same physician for each patient throughout the study in order to maintain consistency. 
11.5 Patient Global Impression of Change  
The PGI -C is used by the patient to compare change in the ir clinical condition at each visit after  
initiation of treatment to an established baseline taken prior to study treatment.  
The PGI -C is based on a 7 -point scale, where at each time point the patient will rate the change 
from baseline using the following query: “ Since the start of the study, my overall status is: 
1 = very much better ; 2 = much better ; 3 = a little better ; 4 = no change; 5 = a little worse; 
6 = much worse; 7 = very much worse.” Within this study, the P GI-C assessment will be based 
on change observed from baseline related to EDS rather than on the totality of the disease.  
The patient will be asked to address the totality of experience on study medication, without 
attempts to demarcate between excessive daytime somnolence and cataplexy.  
11.6 Nocturnal Overnight Polysomnography 
The nocturnal overnight PSG will be completed at the times outlined in the Schedule of 
Assessments ( Table  1). Variables to be collected will include latency to persistent sleep in  
minutes ( latency from lights -off to the first epoch of 20 consecutive epochs of any stage of 
sleep ), number of arousals, number of awakenings, sleep efficiency, total sleep time in minutes, 
WASO in minutes, percentage of time in stage 1, 2, 3, 4, REM slee p percentage, REM sleep 
latency in minutes and periodically movements during sleep (N).

Safety assessments (vi tal signs, physical examinations, ECG recording, AEs, AESIs , CSSRS , 
and clinical laboratory results [routine hematology and biochemi stry]) are to be performed at 
protocol- specified visits, as specified in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table  1). 
12.1 Medical History  and Disease History  
Medical history will be recorded at Screening. Investigators should document the occurrence, 
signs, and symptoms of the  patient’s  pre-existing conditions , including all prior significant 
illnesses. Additional pre -existing conditions present at the time when informed consent is given 
and up to the time of first dosing are to be regarded as concomitant. Medical history will include 
alcohol consumption, smoking, substance abuse, and psychiatric history . 
A detailed medical history will be taken in relation to the patient’s narcolepsy (including cataplexy, if applicable). This will include date of diagnosis, diagnostic tests undertaken and 
symptoms experienced. 
Illnesses first occurring or detected during the study and/or worsening of a concomitant illness 
during the study are to be documented as AEs on the e CRF  in accordance with Section  12.7. All 
changes not present at baseline or described in the past medical history and identified as clinically noteworthy must be recorded as AEs.  
Addi tionally, demographic data will be collected for all  patients and will include date of birth , 
sex, and ethnicity . 
12.2 Vital Signs  
Vital signs (body temperature, respiration rate, heart rate, and systolic and diastolic blood pressure measurements) will be evaluated at the visits indicated in the Schedule of Assessments 
(Table  1). All vital signs will be measured after the patient has been resting in a sitting position 
for at least 5 minutes. Blood pressure measurements are to be taken in the same arm for the 
duration of the study. Body weight (without shoes) will be recorded whenever vital signs are 
recorded ; height (without shoes) will be recorded at Screening only. 
Vital sign measurements will be repeated if clinically significant or machine/equipment errors occur. Out -of-range blood pressure, respiratory rate, or heart rate measurements will be repeated 
at the I nvestigator’s discretion. Any confirmed, clinically significant vital sign measurements 
must be recorded as AEs.  
12.3 Physical Examination  
A complete physical ex amination (head, eyes, ears, nose and throat; heart; lungs; abdomen; skin; 
cervical and axillary lymph nodes; and neurological and musculoskeletal systems) will be 
performed at the visits indicated in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table  1). Physical 
examinations will be performed by a physician  or licensed practitioner.

A 12 -lead, resting ECG will be obtained at the visits indicated in the Schedule of Assessments 
(Table  1). The following parameters will be measured at a minimum: heart rate, PR, QRS, QT 
and Fridericia's correction of QT  intervals.  The same ECG machines should be used for each 
patient throughout the study. 
At Screening, the I nvestigator will examine the ECG traces for signs of cardiac disease that 
could exclude the patient from the study. An assessment of normal or abnormal will be recorded; 
if the ECG is considered abnormal, the abnormality will be documented on the eCRF. 
Electrocardiogram s will be repeated if clinically significant abnormalities are observed or 
artifacts are present.  A central cardiac lab oratory will be used in this study. 
12.5 Laboratory Assessments  
Laboratory assessment samples ( Table  2) are to be obtained at designated visits as detailed in the

abnormalities to be further investigated. All laboratory reports must be reviewed, signed, and dated by the Investigator . A legible copy of all reports must be filed with both the patient’s  eCRF and medical record (source 
document) for that visit. Any laboratory test result considered by the Investigator  to be clinically significant 
should be considered an AE (clinically significant AEs include those that require an intervention ). Clinically 
significant abnormal values occurring during the study will be followed up until repeat test results return to normal, stabilize, or are no longer clinically significant.  
 Further information on sample collection, processing and shipping can be found in the 
Laboratory Manual.  
12.6 Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale  
Two versions of the CSSRS are to be used in the study. The first is to be used at Screening and 
will assess lifetime suicidal ideation and behavior until that point (Bas eline -Screening Form). 
Identification of active suicidal ideation will exclude the patient from enrollment in the study.  
At each su bsequent visit, the follow-up C SSRS is used (Since Last Visit form) to  assess suicidal 
ideation and behavior since the last visit.  
The CSSRS should be administered by a healthcare professional trained in its use.

12.7.1 Adverse Events  
An AE is any symptom, physical sign, syndrome, or disease that either emerges after the patient 
signs the ICF  or, if present at Screening, worsens after signing the ICF , regardless of the 
suspected cause of the event. All medical and psychiatric conditions (except those related to the 
indication under study) present at Screening will be documented in the medical history e CRF. 
Changes in these conditions and new symptoms, physical signs, syndromes, or diseases should be noted on the AE e CRF during the rest of the study. Clinically significant laboratory 
abnormalities should also be recorded as AEs. Surgical procedures that were planned before the patient  enrolled in the study are not considered AEs if the conditions were known before study 
inclusion; the medical condition should be reported in the patient’s  medical history.  
Patients  will be instructed to report AEs at each study visit. All AEs are to be followed up until 
resolution or a stable clinical endpoint is reached.  
Each AE is to be documented on the eCRF with reference to date of onset, duration, frequency, 
severity, relationship to study drug, action taken with study drug, treatment of event, and 
outcome. Furthermore, each AE is to be classified as being serious or nonserious. Changes in 
AEs and resolution dates are to be documented on the e CRF.  
For the purposes of this study, the period of observation for collection of AEs extends from the time the patient gives informed consent until the follow-up visit. Follow-up of the AE, even after 
the date of therapy discontinuation, is required if the AE persists until the event resolves or 
stabilizes at a level acceptable to the Investigator. 
When changes in the intensity of an AE occur more frequently than once a day, the maximum 
intensity for the event should be noted. If the intensity category changes over a number of days, 
then those changes should be recorded separately (with distinct onset dates).  
The severity of AEs will be graded according to Table  3. 
Specific guidelines for classifying AEs by intensity and relationship to study drug are given in Table  3 and Table  4. 
Table  3. Classification of Adverse Events by Intensity  
MILD : An event that is easily tolerated by the patient,  causing minimal discomfort and not interfering with 
everyday activities.  
MODERATE : An event that is sufficiently discomforting to interfere with normal everyday activities.  
SEVERE : An event that prevents normal everyday activities.

16-Aug-2023 This document is confidential.  Page 57 of 79 Table  4. Classification of Adverse Events by Relationship to Study Drug  
UNRELATED : This category applies to those AEs that are clearly and incontrovertibly because of  extraneous 
causes (disease, environment, etc).  
UNLIKELY : This category applies to those AEs that are judged to be unrelated to the test drug but for which no 
extraneous cause may be found. An AE may be considered unlikely to be related to study drug if or when it 
meets 2 of the following criteria: (1) it does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of 
the test drug  (2) it could readily have been produced by the patient’s clinical state, environmental or toxic 
factors, or other modes of therapy administered to the patient (3) it does not follow a known pattern of response 
to the test drug or (4) it does not reappear or worse n when the drug  is readministered.  
POSSIBLY : This category applies to those AEs for which a connection with the test drug administration appears 
unlikely but cannot be ruled out with certainty. An AE may be considered possibly related if or when it meets 2 of the following criteria: (1) it follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the drug; (2) it 
could not readily have been produced by the patient’s clinical state, environmental or toxic factors, or other 
modes of therapy administered to the patient or (3) it follows a known pattern of response to the test drug. 
PROBABLY : This category applies to those AEs that the Investigator  feels with a high degree of certainty are 
related to the test drug . An AE may be considered probably related if or when it meets 3 of the following 
criteria: (1) it follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the  drug (2) it could not be 
reasonably explained by the known characteristics of the patient’s clinical state, environmental or toxic fa ctors, 
or other modes of therapy administered to the patient (3) it disappears or decreases on cessation or reduction in 
dose (note that there are exceptions when an AE does not disappear upon discontinuation of the drug yet 
drug-relatedness clearly exists ; for example, as in bone marrow depression, fixed drug eruptions, or tardive 
dyskinesia); or (4) it follows a known pattern of response to the test drug.  
DEFINITELY : This category applies to those AEs that the Investigator  feels are incontrovertibly related to test 
drug. An AE may be assigned an attribution of definitely related if or when it meets all of the following criteria: 
(1) it follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the drug(2) it could not be reasonably 
explained by the kn own characteristics of the patient’s clinical state, environmental or toxic factors, or other 
modes of therapy administered to the patient (3) it disappears or decreases on cessation or reduction in dose and 
recurs with reexposure to drug (if rechallenge o ccurs); and (4) it follows a known pattern of response to the test 
drug.  
Abbreviation: AE, adverse event.  
 12.7.2 Adverse Events of Special Interest  
An AESI  (serious or non serious) is one of scientific and medical concern specific to the 
Sponsor’s product or program, for which ongoing monitoring and rapid communication by the 
Investigator to the Sponsor could be appropriate. Such an event might require further 
investigation in order to characterize and understand it.  
For the purposes of th is study, the following AEs are classed as AESIs:  
• Vivid and/or unpleasant dreams 
• Difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep  
Such AESI should be recorded in the eCRF and reported to the medical monitor via email. 
12.7.3 Serious Adverse Events 
An S AE is any untoward medical occurrence, in the view of either the Investigator  or Sponsor , that : 
• Results in death  
• Is life -threatening 
Suven Life Sciences  CTP2S13031H3 
SUVN -G3031 Version 4.0 Final 
 
16-Aug-2023 This document is confidential.  Page 58 of 79 • Results in inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
Other important medical events that may not be immediately life -threatening or result in death or 
hospitalization, based upon appropriate medical judgment, are considered SAEs if they are 
thought to jeopardiz e the patient  and/or require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of 
the outcomes defining an SAE. Serious AEs are critically important for the identification of significant safety problems; therefore, it is important to take into account both the Investigator ’s 
and the Sponsor’s assessment. If either the Sponsor or the Investigator believes that an event is serious, the event must be considered serious and evaluated by the Sponsor for expedited 
reporting. 
12.7.4 Serious Adverse Event Reporting  
An SAE o ccurring from the time informed consent is obtained, during the study, or within 
14 days of stopping the treatment must be reported to the  Safety and 
Pharmacovigilance group and will be communicated to the Sponsor. Any such SAE because of  
any cause, whether or not related to the study drug, must be reported within 24 hours of 
occurrence or when the Investigator becomes aware of the event. Notification can be made using 
the dedicated fax line or email  for the  pharmacovigilance group: 
 
 
  
If the Investigator contacts the pharmacovigilance group by telephone, then a 
written report must follow within 24 hours and is to include a full description of the event and 
sequelae in the format detailed in the SAE reporting form.  
The event must also be recorded on the standard AE eCRF. Preliminary reports of SAEs must be followed up by detailed descriptions later on, including clear and anonymized photocopies of 
hospital case reports, consultant reports, autopsy reports, and other documents when requested and applicable. Serious AE reports must be made whet her or not the Investigator considers the 
event to be related to the investigational drug. 
Appropriate remedial measures should be taken to treat the SAE, and the response should be 
recorded. Clinical, laboratory, and diagnostic measures should be employed as needed in order to 
determine the etiology of the problem. The Investigator must report all additional follow -up 
evaluations to the  Safety and Pharmacovigilance group within 24 hours of 
becoming aware of the additional information or as so on as is  practicable . All SAEs will be 
followed up until the Investigator and Sponsor agree the event is satisfactorily resolved.

SUVN -G3031 Version 4.0 Final 
 
16-Aug-2023 This document is confidential.  Page 59 of 79 Any SAE that is not resolved by the end of the study or upon discontinuation of the patient’s  
participation in the study is to  be followed up until it either resolves, stabilizes, returns to 
baseline values (if a baseline value is available), or is shown to not be attributable to the study 
drug or procedures. 
12.7.5 Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions 
Any A Es that meet all of the following criteria will be classified as suspected unexpected serious 
adverse reactions (SUSARs) and reported to the appropriate regulatory authorities in accordance 
with applicable regulatory requirements for expedited reporting: 
• Serious 
• Unexpected ( i.e., the event is not consistent with the safety information in the 
Investigators Brochure) 
• There is at least a reasonable possibility that there is a causal relationship between the 
event and the study treatment 
The I nvestigator will assess whether an event is causally related to study treatment. The Sponsor 
(  ) will consider the Investigator ’s assessment and determine whether the event 
meets the criteria for being reportable as a 7 -day or 15- day safety report. SUSARs that are fatal 
or life -threatening SUSARs must be reported to the regulatory authorities and the institutional 
revie w boards ( IRBs ; where required) within 7 days after the Sponsor ( ) has 
first knowledge of them, with a follow -up report submitted within a further 8 calendar days. 
Other SUSARs must be reported to the relevant regulatory aut horities and the  IRBs within 
15 calendar days after the Sponsor ( ) first has knowledge of them. 
The Sponsor ( ) is responsible for reporting SUSARs and any other events 
required to be reported in an expedited manner to the regulatory authori ties and for informing 
Investigator s of reportable events, in compliance with applicable regulatory requirements within 
specific timeframes. Investigators will notify the relevant IRBs of reportable events within the applicable timeframes.  
12.7.6 Pregnancy  
Women of childbearing potential  (WOCBP) must have a negative pregnancy test at S creening , 
Baseline, and follow-up. After administration of study drug, any known cases of pregnancy in 
female patients  or female partners of male patients will be reported until the patient completes or 
withdraws from the study. The pregnancy will be reported immediately by faxing/emailing a completed pregnancy report to the Sponsor (or designee) within 24 hours of knowledge of the 
event. The pregnancy will not be pro cessed as an SAE;  however, the I nvestigator will follow -up 
with the patient /patient partner until completion of the pregnancy and must assess the outcome in 
the shortest possible time but not more than 30 days after completion of the pregnancy. The Investigator should noti fy the Sponsor (or designee) of the pregnancy outcome by submitting a 
follow -up pregnancy report. If the outcome of the pregnancy involved spontaneous or

16-Aug-2023 This document is confidential.  Page 60 of 79 therapeutic abortion (any congenital anomaly detected in an aborted fetus is to be documented), 
stillb irth, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly, the Investigator will report the event by 
faxing /emailing  a completed pregnancy report form to the Sponsor (or designee) within 24 hours 
of knowledge of the event. 
Upon discontinuation from the study, only those procedures that would not expose the patient to 
undue risk will be performed. The I nvestigator should also be notified of pregnancy occurring 
during the study but confirmed after completion of the study. In t he event that a patient/patient 
partner is subsequently found to be pregnant after inclusion of the patient in the study, any 
pregnancy will be followed to term, and the status of mother and child will be reported to the 
Sponsor after delivery.  
12.7.7 Overdose  
The Investigator must immediately  (within  24 hours ) notify the Sponsor medical monitor, by 
email,  of any occurrence of overdose with study drug. An overdose is classed as the patient  
taking more than 1 tablet in a calendar day.

16-Aug-2023 This document is confidential.  Page 62 of 79 14 STATISTICAL ANALYSI S 
A SAP will be prepared after the protocol is approved. This document will provide further details 
regarding the definition of analysis variables and analysis methodology to address all study 
objectives. The SAP will serve as a compl ement to the protocol and supersedes it in case of 
differences.  
The statistical evaluation will be performed using SAS® software version 9.4 or higher 
(SAS  Institute, Cary, NC). All data will be listed, and summary tables will be provided. 
Summary statistics will be presented b y treatment group. For continuous variables, data will be 
summarized with the number of patients  (n), mean, SD , standard error of mean, median, 
minimum, and maximum by treatment group. For categorical variables, data will be tabulated 
with the number and proportion of patients  for each category by treatment group. 
An unblinded interim analysis is planned when approximately 50% of patients have completed 14 days of treatment (V isit 3 completed). This interim analysis is for the purpose of sample size 
re-estimation, and futility will not be examined.  Interim analysis will occur under the supervision 
of an independently charted DMC . See Sectio n 7.1.4.  
14.1 Determination of Sample Size  
This study plans to randomize 114 patients, using 1:1:1 treatment allocation (stratified  by at least 
30% each by reported catapl exy patient history , Na-1 or Na-2 respectively ), 38 to each treatment 
group. Using an SD of 5.0, N = 38 randomized patients per group will provide 80% power, to detect a treatment difference over placebo of 3.5 points or greater on the MWT at a 2 -sided 
Type I error level of 0.05, assuming a dropout rate of 10%. 
Because of the unknown prognostic importance of a history of cataplexy with EDS on study 
outcome, a stratification factor will be included based upon that clinical presentation. 
Stratification would be applied across the entire study, and not within an individual center, and will be reflected in the analytic model. The purpose of the a  priori defined subgroup is for 
hypothesis generation. 
14.2 Analysis Populations  
Intent -to-Treat (ITT)  Population 
The ITT population will include all patients who were randomized, received at least one dose of 
study drug, and had baseline and at least one post -baseline primary efficacy assessment.  
Safety Population  
The safety population will include all randomized pat ients  who receive at least 1  dose of study 
treatment. The treatment group assignment in this population will be defined by the treatment actually received. This population will be used for the analysis of safety.

SUVN -G3031 Version 4.0 Final 
 
16-Aug-2023 This document is confidential.  Page 63 of 79 Per Protocol (PP)  Population  
The PP population will be a subset of ITT consisting of those patients who complete 14 days 
treatment and had no major protocol deviation affecting the primary efficacy variable. All 
protocol deviations will be assessed and documented on a case-by- case basis before the database 
lock, and deviations considered to have a serious impact on the efficacy results will lead to the relevant patient being excluded from the PP set. Before database lock, potential patient 
exclusions from PP set will be reviewed by the Sponsor and documented in a patient evaluability 
document. 
Pharmacokinetic (PK)  Population 
The PK  population will include all patients who receive at least 1 dose of study treatment with 
sufficient post dose plasma concentration data. This population will be used for PK analysis. 
14.3 Efficacy Analysis  
All efficacy analyses will be performed using the ITT population. 14.3.1 Analysis of Primary Efficacy Endpoint 
The primary efficacy endpoint is the change from baseline in the mean total ESS score at 
Day 14. A successful study requires demonstration of statistical ly significant differences between 
the combined SUVN-G3031 doses (2 mg and 4 mg) group and the placebo group at endpoint for the ESS.  
The null (H0) and alternative (H1) hypotheses of the study are as follows:  
H0: SUVN-G3031 and placebo do not differ in their change from baseline in the mean 
total ESS  score at Day 14.  
H1: SUVN-G3031 and placebo differ in their change from baseline in the mean total ESS 
score at Day 14.  
The primary endpoint w ill be analyzed using a mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) 
analysis that includes the mean total ESS score  from baseline to 7  days through to 14 days. This 
method is the preferred approach to longitudinal analysis because it utilizes observed data 
effici ently.  
The model will include randomized  treatment, visit and treatment -by-visit interaction as 
explanatory variables, stratification factor for cataplexy patient history  (presence or absence)  and 
baseline total ESS score as covariates. The participant eff ect will be assumed to be random, and 
an unstructured covariance structure will be assumed for within participant variation. The main 
comparison will be a contrast between treatment groups at 14 days. Least square mean changes 
will be estimated for SUVN -G3031 and placebo.  
This analysis will be repeated for the ITT and PP populations.

16-Aug-2023 This document is confidential.  Page 64 of 79 Various sensitivity analyses will be performed using an analysis of c ovariance (ANCOVA)  and 
multiple imputation pattern mixture model to handle missing data. Estimands specification and 
sensitivity analyses details will be included in the  SAP.  
14.3.2 Analysis of Secondary Efficacy Endpoints 
The secondary efficacy endpoints for this study are: 
• Change fr om baseline in the mean CGI -S score related to EDS at Day 14  
• Change from baseline in the mean MWT  score at Day 14  
To control the Type I error rate, the testing of secondary endpoints will be controlled using 
hierarchical testing methods. Thus, only if the primary endpoint is statistically significant, will 
the first listed secondary endpoint be tested. Likewise, the second listed secondary endpoint will 
only be tested if the first secondary endpoint is also statistically significant.  
The secondary endpoints will be analyzed analogous to the analysis of the primary efficacy 
endpoint, i.e., an MMRM using the ITT population with the same factors, except the baseline 
value for the respective variable will be used instead of baseline total ESS score.  
14.3.3 Analysis of Exploratory Endpoints 
Continuous exploratory endpoints (listed below) will be analyzed in a similar fashion as the primary endpoint, i.e., an MMRM using the ITT population with the same factors, except the 
baseline value for the respective variable will be used instead of baseline total ESS score.  
• Change from baseline in the mean total ESS score at Day 7  
• Change from baseline in the mean CGI- S score related to EDS at Day 7  
• Change from baseline in the mean MWT score at Day 7  
• Change from baseline in the behavior of s leep diary parameters at Day 7 and Day 14 
(7-day average)  
• Changes in the behavior of the nocturnal overnight PSG assessments at Day 7 and 
Day 14 
• Change in MWT score, within each of the 4 MWT sessions within a single day (Day 7 and Day 14) 
For binary assessments (listed below), a repeated measures responder analyses will use a generalized estimating equations with a logit link function and starting with an unstructured 
working correlation matrix.  
• The proportion of pat ients reporting CGI -C scores of 1 or 2 at Day 14 (EDS) 
• The proportion of patients reporting CGI-S scores related to EDS of 1 or 2 at Day 7 and 
Day 14

Day 14 
• Analysis of a ll endpoints (except sleep diary parameters and nocturnal overnight PSG 
assessments) evaluating SUVN -G3031 2 mg or 4 mg compared with placebo 
• Additional exploratory endpoints may be included in the SAP 
Factors included in the model will be treatment group, a stratification factor for cataplexy patient 
history, visit, treatment- by-visit interaction, and baseline value as a covariate.  Model estimates 
will be based on Wald statistics.  
Exploratory measures will also include the evaluation of associated features of narcolepsy 
through a sleep diary and measures collected as part of the nocturnal overnight PSG assessments at Day 7 and Day 14 using descriptive statistics.  
Further exploratory analyses will include each individual MWT session throughout the day in comparison to matched baseline sessions (morning, afternoon, or evening testing periods as 
defined within the protocol).  
14.4 Safety Analysis 
14.4.1 Adverse Events  
All reported AEs will be coded using the most recent version of Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activitie s (MedDRA). The incidence of TEAEs  (events with onset dates on or after 
the start of the study drug) will be included in incidence tables. Events with missing onset dates will be included as treatment -emergent  unless an incomplete date clearly indicates th at the event 
started prior to the first study drug administration. If a patient experiences more than 
1 occurrence of the same AE, the occurrence with the greatest severity and the closest 
association with the study drug will be used in the summary tables. Serious AEs, AEs causing 
discontinuation and AE SIs will be tabulated. All AEs will be listed by patient , along with 
information regarding onset, duration, relationship and severity to study drug, action taken with study drug, treatment of event, and outcome. 
14.4.2 Laboratory Evaluations 
Descriptive statistics will be performed for those laboratory parameters on a continuous scale for 
the raw scores and change from baseline at each visit. Categorical results for urinalysis will be 
summarized using frequency tabulations. Abnormal values for each analyte will be determined 
using reference ranges provided by the central laboratory. All laboratory results will be listed 
including unscheduled visits. 
14.4.3 Vital Signs  
Actual and change from baseline values in vital si gns (body temperature, respiration rate, heart 
rate, and systolic and diastolic blood pressure) and body weight will be summarized for each 
scheduled visit. The corresponding listing will be provided.

14.4.5 Prior and Concomitant Medications 
All nonstudy medications will be classified using the dynamic version of the World Health 
Organization Drug Dictionary (WHODD). Coding includes the Anatomical Therapeutic 
Chemical (ATC) classification levels  and preferred term.  
All medications administered and stopped prior to first dose of study drug are considered as prior medications. Any me dications taken before the first dose and continued after the first dose or 
medications taken on or after the first dose of study drug are classified as concomitant medications. Concomitant medications will be summarized by the ATC levels and preferred 
term. All nonstudy medications will be listed.  
14.4.6 Physical Examination  
Physical examination data (Normal/Abnormal) at each visit will be listed by body system.  
14.4.7 Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale  
Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale  data will be listed for all patients.  
14.4.8 Patient Disposition  
All patients who discontinued from treatment will be listed and the reasons for discontinuation will be tabulated.  
14.4.9 Demographic and Baseline Characteristics  
Demographic and baseline characteristics will be summarized using descriptive statistics. Demographics and informed consent data will be listed for all randomized patients . 
14.5 Pharmacokinetic Analysis  
The PK data will be summarized using descriptive statistics and all plasma concentration data will be listed using the PK population. 
14.6 Interim Analysis  
Because of uncertainty in the underlying assumption supporting the power calculation, an 
unblinded interim analysis is planned  when approximately 50% of patients have completed 
14 days of treatment  (Visit 3 completed) in order to increase the sample size if this deemed 
necessary and thus to increase the likelihood for a positive study.  
The unblinded interim analysis is for the purpose of sample size re -estimation, and futility will 
not be examined. Sample size re- estimation will be performed using conditional power 
calculations. In case of sample size increase the weighted Cui, Hung, Wang test -statistic will be 
used for the combination of the data prior to the interim analysis and after interim analysis.

documentation maintained at the study site, unless the study site makes direct data entry to the databases for which no other original or source documentation is maintained.  In such cases, the 
study site should document which eCRFs are subject to direct data entry and should have in place procedures to obtain and retain copies of the information submitted by direct data entry. 
All study forms and records transmitted to the Sponsor must only include coded identifiers such 
that directly  identifying personal information is not transmitted.  The primary method of data 
transmittal is via the secure, internet -based electronic data capture (EDC) system maintained by 
 the EDC system is available to only authorized users via the study’s 
internet web site, where a user unique assigned username and password are required for access.

Electronic CRFs will be considered complete when all miss ing and/or incorrect data have been 
resolved. 
15.3 Source Documents  
Source documents are considered to be all information in original records and certified copies of 
original records of clinical findings, observations, data, or other activities in a clinical study 
necessary for the reconstruction and evaluation of the study. The Investigator will provide dire ct 
access to source documents and/or source data in the facilitation of trial -related monitoring, 
audits, review by IRBs, and regulatory inspections. 
The Investigator/institution should maintain adequate and accurate source documents and trial 
records that  include all pertinent observations on each of the site’s trial patients.  Source data 
should be attributable, legible, contemporaneous, original, accurate, and complete. Changes to source data should be traceable, not obscure the original entry, and be exp lained if necessary . 
15.4 Record Retention  
Study records and source documents must be preserved for at least 15 years after the completion or discontinuation of/withdrawal from the study , at least 2 years after the  drug being studied has 
received its last approval for sale, or at least 2 years after the drug development has stopped, and in accordance with the applicable local privacy laws, whichever is the longer time period.  
The I nvestigator agrees to comply with all applicable federal, state, and local laws and 
regulations relating to the privacy of patient  health information, including, but not limited to, the 
Standards for Individually Identifiable Health Information, 45 CFR, Parts 160 and 164 (the Health Insurance Po rtability Accountability Act of 1996 [HIPAA] Privacy Regulation).The 
Investigator shall ensure that study patient authorize the use and disclosure of protected health 
information in accordance with HIPAA Privacy Regulation and in a form satisfactory to the Sponsor. 
15.5 Monitoring  
The study will be monitored  according t o the monitoring plan to ensure that it is conducted and 
documented properly according to the protocol, GCP , and all applicable regulatory requirements. 
Monitoring visits , on-site and remote and contacts will be made at appropriate times during the 
study. The PI will assure he/she and adequate site personnel are available throughout the study to 
collaborate with clinical monitors. Clinical monitors must have direct access to source 
documentation in order to check the completeness, clarity, and consistency of the data recorded 
in the eCRFs  for each  patient.  
The Investigator will make available to the clinical monitor all source docum ents and medical 
records necessary to review protocol adherence and eCRFs . In addition, the Investigator will 
work closely with the clinical monitor and, as needed, provide them appropriate evidence that the

guidelines. 
15.6 Quality Control and Quality Assurance  
The Sponsor or its designee will perform the quality assurance and quality control activities of 
this study; however, responsibility for the accuracy, completeness, security, and reliability of the 
study data presented to the Sponsor lies with the Investigator generating the data. 
The Sponsor will arrange audits as part of the implementation of quality assurance to ensure that 
the study is being conducted in compliance with the protocol, standard operating procedures, 
GCP  and all applicable regulatory requirements.  Audits will be independent of and separate from 
the routine monitoring and quality control functions. Quality assurance procedures will be performed at stu dy sites and during data management to assure that safety and efficacy data are 
adequate and well documented.  
15.7 Protocol Amendment and Protocol Deviation 
15.7.1 Protocol Amendment  
Amendments to the protocol that entail corrections of typographical errors, clarifica tions of 
confusing wording, changes in study personnel, and minor modifications that have no effect on the safety of patient  or the conduct of the study will be classed as administrative amendments 
and will be submitted to the IRB for information only.  The Sponsor will ensure that 
acknowledgement is received and filed.  Amendments that are classed as substantial amendments 
must be submitted to the appropriate regulatory authorities and the IRBs for approval and will 
not be implemented at sites until such approvals are received other than in the case of an urgent 
safety measure. 
15.7.2 Protocol Deviations 
Should a protocol deviation occur, the Sponsor must be informed as soon as possible.  Protocol 
deviations and/or violations and the reasons they occurred will be included in the clinical study 
report.  Reporting of protocol deviations to the IRB and in accordance with applicable regulatory 
authority mandates is an Investigator responsibility .

16-Aug-2023 This document is confidential.  Page 76 of 79 Appendix  1. Contraception Guidelines  
Women of childbearing potential ( WOCBP ) and men whose sexual partners are WOCBP must 
use at least 2 highly effective method s of contraception during the study and for 30 days after the 
last dose of study treatment.  
A woman is cons idered to be a WOCBP (fertile) after menarche and until becoming postmenopausal, 
unless she is permanently sterile. Permanent sterilization methods include hysterectomy, bilateral 
salpingectomy, and bilateral oophorectomy. A postmenopausal state is defined  as no menses for 
12 months without an alternative medical cause. A high follicle -stimulating hormone (FSH) level in 
the postmenopausal range may be used to confirm a postmenopausal state in women not using 
hormonal contraception or hormonal replacement th erapy. However, in the absence of 12 months of 
amenorrhea, a single FSH measurement is insufficient.  
A man is considered fertile after puberty unless permanently sterile by bilateral orchidectomy.  
Highly effective methods of contraception are those which have a failure rate of <1% (when 
implemented consistently and correctly) and include: 
• Combined (containing estrogen and progestogen) hormonal contraception associated with 
inhibition of ovulation (administration  may be ora l, intravaginal, or transdermal)  
• Progestogen-only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation 
(administration  may be o ral, injectable, or implantable)  
• Intrauterine device  
• Intrauterine hormone -releasing system  
• Bilateral tubal ligation or occlusion  
• Vasectomy (provided that the male has a medical assessment of surgical success)  
• Sexual abstinence (defined as refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the entire 
period of risk  in relation to the duration of the clinical trial, in line with the prefe rred and 
usual lifestyle of the  patient ) 
All patients will be strongly advised that they (or the female partners of male patients) should not 
become pregnant while on study treatment or for 30 days after the last dose. A female patient 
will be advised that she must report immediately to the study site for pregnancy testing and appropriate management in the event that she may be pregnant.

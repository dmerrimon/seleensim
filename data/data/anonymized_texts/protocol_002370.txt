Study Design  
This is a safety follow -up study through 180 days  of remestemcel -L treatment in subject s 
who participated in MSB -GVHD001 . This study  will also explore duration of response  over 
time. Subject s who participated in MSB -GVHD001 and received at least one dose of 
remestemcel -L as outlined in that protocol will be evaluated at baseline ( Day 100) and at 
Days 120, 140, 16 0 and 180 for safety endpoints . Subject s who participate d in Protocol 
MSB -GVHD001and received the first 8 doses of remestemcel -L as outlined in that  protocol 
will be evaluated at baseline ( Day 100) and at Days 120, 140, 160 and 180 after initial 
remestemcel -L infusion for evidence of duration of response  over t ime. 
Study Population  
Safety population : All subject s who participated in Protocol MSB -GVHD001  and received 
at least one remestemcel -L infusion in that protocol.  
 
Duration of response  population:  All subject s who participated in Protocol MSB -
GVHD001 , received the first 8 doses  of remestemcel -L as outlined in th at protocol , and 
showed overall response (OR) or very good partial response (VGPR) to remestemcel -L at 
Day 28 . 
Inclusion Criteria  
Patients are eligible for the study if all of the following criteria  are met:  
1. Subject s must have participat ed in Protocol MSB -GVHD001  and have received at 
least one infusion of remestemcel -L. 
2. Subject  or subject ’s authorized representative must be capable of providing written 
informed consent .  Assent, if applicable, must also be collected when required by 
the IRB/EC.  
3. Female subject s of childbearing potential ( ≥ 10 years of age ); (Appendix 7) must 
use a medically accepted method of contraception and must agree to continue use of 
this method for the duration of the study and for the follow -up time period. 
Acceptable metho ds of contraception include abstinence, barrier method with 
spermicide, intrauterine device (IUD), or steroidal contraceptive (oral, transdermal, 
implanted, and injected) in conjunction with a barrier method.  
4. The subject  must be willing and able to comply  with study procedures , remain at the 
clinic as required during the study period,  and return to the clinic for the follow -up 
evaluation as specified in this protocol.

 Statistical Analysis  
General  
Categorical variables will be summarized using frequencies and percentages. Continuous 
variables will be summarized using descriptive statistics (n, mean, standard deviation [SD], 
median, minimum, and maximum). Conf idence intervals, if presented, will be at the  95% 
confidence level.  
 
The baseline value for a variable is defined as the last non -missing observation prior to or 
equal to the first dose date of study treatment  in MSB -GVHD001 . Data collected at 
unscheduled  time points will not be summarized at the unscheduled time points.  
 
Study day will be calculated from the first infusion date  from MSB -GVHD001, unless 
otherwise specified . 
 
Analysis Populations  
The analysis population for the safety assessment in this st udy will include all subject s from 
Protocol MSB -GVHD001 who have signed the Informed Consent form and have received 
at least one dose of remestemcel -L. The analysis population for the duration of response  
assessments in this study will include Protocol MSB -GVHD001 subjects with overall 
response and VGPR to remestemcel -L at Day 28,  who have signed the Informed Consent 
form and have completed treatment for the first 28 days , as pr escribed in Protocol MSB -
GVHD001 .  
 
Safety Analyses  
Safety assessments will be s ummarized with descriptive statistics for subject s in the 
analysis population . Listings will be provided for adverse events (AEs), serious adverse 
events (SAEs), 12 -lead ECG and ectopic tissue formation. Vital signs will be provided as 
change from baseline  tables by infusion number categories.

 1. BACKGROUND  
1.1 Acute Graft -versus Host Disease  
Graft versus host disease (GVHD) is a progressive and lethal complication of hematopoietic 
stromal cell transplantation (HSCT) and donor leukocyte infusion.  Two clinically distinct forms 
of GVHD have been described; acute GVHD, which typicall
y occurs within 100 days of HSCT,1 
and chronic GVHD, which is characterized by later onset.2  However, this arbitrary temporal 
distinction between the acute and chronic forms of GVHD has been largely discarded with the 
recognition of these forms as discrete pathophysiologic conditions defin ed by separate clinical 
and diagnostic criteria .3,4 
 
Occurrence of acute GVHD (aGVHD) after allogeneic transplantation is fairly common, with 
Grades II to IV aGVHD reported in approximately 39% of cases involving sibling donors and 
59% of cases with unrelated donors.5  Overall, an estimated 20% to 80% of patients who receive 
a
llogeneic HSCT develop acute GVHD, even after prophylaxis with immunosuppressive agents.6  
 
W
hile aGVHD is common among patients with allogeneic transplantation, overall, it is a rare 
disease, affecting about 10,000 individuals per year worldwide, with an estimated 2,000 cases 
found in children (Table 1 ).  Approximately 5,500 of worldwide aGVHD cases are refractory to 
ster
oid,1 of which 1,000-1,200 are pediatric cases.

In aGvHD, alloreactive T cells present in the donor cell transplant recognize the recipient’s 
tissues as foreign and mount an immunological attack, causing inflammation and tissue damage 
primarily affecting the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, skin, and liver .7  Human leukocyte antigen 
(H
LA) disparity between HSC donor and recipient is the key driver of GVHD, causing donor 
T cells to recognize recipient tissue as foreign .7.  The severity of the disease is associated with 
the de
gree of HLA mismatch between the donor and the recipient, and a greater mismatch will 
result in more aggressive alloreactivity. 8  Damage to recipient tissue caused by the HSCT 
c
onditioning regimen (irradiation or chemo-ablation) creates a cellular
 and molecular 
environment that is conducive to GVHD. The tissue damage leads to the increased secretion of 
MSB -GVHD002  Version  4.0 
Clinical Study Protocol   
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 19 of 79 Mesoblast  
 proinflammatory cytokines, which promote donor T cell proliferation and differentiation and 
interaction with recipient antigen presenting cells. Alloreactive donor T c
ells traffic to target 
tissues (skin, gut, liver) and release soluble mediators that mediate cytotoxicity and end organ 
damage. Other donor immune cells, including natural killer cells, neutrophils and monocytes, 
are 
also activated and recruited to target organs and contribute to host tissue destruction .9  This 
adverse immune reaction increases over time as the expanding tissue damage mediated by 
alloreactive immune cells leads to more cytokine production.  A vicious cycle ensues: 
amplification of cytokine expression supports further proliferation and activa
tion of alloreactive 
immune cells, which in turn leads to further tissue damage .7. Consequently, aGVHD potentially 
invol
ves multiple organ systems, with varying degrees of clinical severity. 
 
Acute GVHD primarily affects the skin, the liver, and the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, though the 
GVHD reaction targets a number of different host cells, including those of the skin epithelia and 
mucosa, hair follicles, intestinal crypts, liver bile ducts, bone marrow, and immune system.1,7  
Disea
se onset often manifests clinically as a pruritic maculopapular rash that first appears on the 
nape of the neck, shoulders, ears, palms of the hands, and soles of the feet.  The liver is the next 
most commonly affected organ after skin; symptoms of liver involvement include jaundice and 
increased alkaline phosphatase levels that indicate damage to the bile canaliculi and portend 
cholestasis.  The GI tract is the third organ among the tissues most commonly affected in acute 
GVHD, frequently presenting as nausea, vomiting, intestinal bleeding, cra
mping, and diarrhea. 
GI involvement is often the most severe of the organs affected and can be the most difficult to 
treat.  The large volumes of watery diarrhea common to intestinal involvement in acute GVHD 
often transitions into bloody diarrhea that prompt the need for frequent transfusions.7  
 
1.2 Current Treatment of aGVHD and Prognosis 
Presently, there are no approved therapies for treatment of aGVHD.  Available treatment options 
to prevent aGVHD have historically involved front-line therapy with glucoc
orticoids along with 
different combinations of prophylaxis agents such as methotrexate and cyclosporine A.6,10-12  
While many patients who develop aGVHD respond well to first-line corticosteroid treatment, 
steroids achieve complete response rates in only approximately 50% of cases.13  Many aGVHD 
patients display inadequate response to corticosteroid, with approximately 10% to 30% of 
aGVHD
 patients progressing to the more severe Glucksberg Grades III or IV GVHD.5 
 
As shown by the survival curves in Figure 2, prognosis for patients with the most severe forms of 
aGVHD (IBMTR Grades C and D) is dismal, primarily because of 
greater risk for infectious 
complications, immunosuppression- mediated toxicity, and often incomplete GVHD remission.14  
MSB -GVHD002  Version  4.0 
Clinical Study Protocol   
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 20 of 79 Mesoblast  
 Patients that do not respond to steroid therapy have expected one-year survival rates of just 5% 
to 30%.6,8,15-19  A wide  variety of second-line immunosuppressive agents are commonly used to 
treat steroid-refractory aGVHD (SR-aGVHD), though there is little evidence to support the 
efficacy of these drugs as secondary therapy for aGVHD .6

1.3 G rading of Acute GVHD 
Acute GVHD is a heterogeneous set of disease processes that potentially involves multiple organ 
systems, with varying degrees of severity by organ system.  Disease onset typically manifests 
most commonly in the skin, with the GI tract and liver as the nex
t most common sites involved.17  
Hist
orically, classification systems of aGVHD have been established to segregate aGVHD 
according to severity.  The severity grade of aGVHD has been shown to correspond to overall 
survival, with increased transplant-related mortality
 correlating with higher aGVHD grade .20

 1.5 Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSCs) as Therapy for Acute GVHD 
 
 
 
 
 
    
 
 
 
 
   
 
MSCs have
 bee
n shown to attenuate inflammatory and immunological processes relevant t
o 
GVHD. MSCs demonstrate immunosuppressive activity in T cell-driven immune responses in 
animal models of allogenic skin graft rejection and GVHD .33,34,35  In vitro , MSCs suppress T-cell 
proliferation in response to allo-antigenic and mitogenic stimulation, and stimulate an increase in 
the regulatory T cell (Treg) population. 36,37,38  Data suggest that Tregs play an important role in 
inhi
biting allogeneic T cell response and aGVHD.6,7  In co-cult
ure systems, MSCs alter the 
cytokine secretion prof
ile of immune cells (dendritic cells, naïve and e
ffector T cells, natural 
killer cells), decreasing expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g. IFNγ, TNFα) and 
increasing secretion of anti-inflammatory cytokines (e.g. IL-4, IL-10) .33  The immunomodulatory 
e
ffects of MSCs are attributable, at least in part, to secretion of soluble factors such as PGE2 .33  
In addition, MSCs may mediate tissue protection and repair at sites of injury in GVHD by 
secretion of soluble factors that are known to mediate processes such as inhibition of apoptotic 
cell death, recruitment of endogenous stem cell populations and angiogenesis .39,40,41

 1.8 Clinical Safety  of Remestemcel-L 
Refer to the remestemcel-L clinical safety as summarized in the MSB-GVHD001 protocol. 
 
1.9 P otential Risks of MSCs 
A list of adverse events (AEs) possibly or probably related to remestemcel-L use is found in the 
Investigator’s Brochure ( IB) and in Protocol MSB-GVHD001 Section 1.7.8.   All AEs were 
events commonly expected in the treated population, independent of the infusions of hMSCs.  
The
 most common adverse events observed for remestemcel-L in clinical trials of pediatric 
GVHD were infections, gastrointestinal disorders, and respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal 
disorders. 
 
Due to the known immune modulating effects of hMSCs, there is a risk of immune suppression 
and increased infection risk.  Subjects undergoing treatment for GVHD are typically severely 
im
munocompromised.  Treatment with remestemcel-L may lead to further immunosuppression.  
Therefore, the potential exists for an increased risk of infectious complications.  Careful subject 
moni
toring and appropriate anti-infective prophylaxis is recommended. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
In theory, cells grown and expanded outside the body have the potential to be contaminated, and 
infection could be introduced to the subject at the time of infusion.  This risk is made negligible 
b
y processing cells in a Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP)-compliant production facility, 
utilizing a closed system, and then by reconstituting them in a cell processing facility 
immediately prior to administration.  The potential risks of introducing a donor-derived 

MSB -GVHD002  Version  4.0 
Clinical Study Protocol   
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 26 of 79 Mesoblast  
 infectious agent are minimized by strict adherence to the 21CFR1271 Subpart C Donor 
Eligibility and multiple screenings/testing of remestemcel-L for adventitious agents prior to 
release.  The IB conta
ins a full list of donor screening tests performed on all lots of remestemcel-
L during production. 
 
 
 
 
 
There has been no 
experience with pregnant women receiving infusions of remestemcel-L. The 
effects of remestemcel- L infusion on the developing fetus have not been established pre-
clinically or in clinical trials.  Thus, all females of childbearing potential (subjects ≥ 10 years of 
age) and post-pubescent males with female partners of childbearing potential are to consent to 
use a
n effective method of birth control during this treatment protocol in a manner that 
minimizes risk of failure .  Abstinence is an option.  Guidelines on childbearing potential and 
c
ontraceptives are located in Appendix 7.

2. CLINICA L RATIONALE 
2.1 Rationale for the Study 
There are currently no approved therapies for aGVHD in the US.  Standard front-line treatment 
generally consists of corticosteroid, which produce a complete response in about half of all 
subj
ects.13  Even with the availability of corticosteroids, approximately 10% to 30% of aGVHD 
subjects dev
elop more severe aGVHD of Glucksberg Grades III or IV .5  A variety of 
immunosuppressants are currently used as second-line therapy, though none of these have 
established efficacy against steroid-refractory aGVHD.6  The reported one-year survival rate for 
subj
ects that do not respond to steroid therapy ranges from 5% to 30%.6,8,15-19  There is thus a 
strong
 need for agents with demonstrated efficacy for treating steroid-refractory aGVHD.  
 
MSB-GVHD001 will provide a series of prescribed doses of remestemcel-L and a follow up 
period of 100 days.  There is a great interest in collecting data regarding treatment of aGVHD 
with respect to the duration of response, the ability to taper steroid and other secondary
 treatment 
and thereby mitigate potential side effects, the development of chronic GVHD after at least 
partial response to treatment, and any change in quality of life.  Accordingly, this study will 
assess the efficacy and safety of remestemcel-L in pediatric patients with aGV
HD refractory to 
corticosteroid. 
 
2.2 Rat ionale for Study Design 
Overall response, as defined by the response to treatment at Day 28, has been positively 
associated with non-relapse mortality at 6 months and 2 years.26,28  Response at Day 28 has been 
supporte
d guidelines issued by the expert panel of the American Society for B
lood and Marrow 
Transplant (ASBMT) in 200924 as well as by subsequent studies .25,27  Treatment of acute GVHD, 
whic
h results in response by 28 days, has been shown to correlate well with survival rates at 
Day 

MSB -GVHD002  Version  4.0 
Clinical Study Protocol   
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 29 of 79 Mesoblast  
 100.  Recovery after acute treatment as well as the period after treatment has been associated 
with an increased incidence of opportunistic infections and many other AEs, some due to the 
effects of the disease itself and many due to the treatment intervention, particularly with 
protracted high-dose steroid use.  Th is s tudy will provide safety data through 180 days after 
treatment of aGVHD.  In addition, the present study will also provide information with regard to 
surviva
l at Day 180, the ability to taper steroid doses and secondary medications and thereby 
mitiga
te potential risks, the development of chronic GVHD after at least partial response to 
tre
atment, quality of life (QoL), and duration of response.  Though validated tools for QoL are 
limited for pediatric subjects, this study will evaluate several tools and accommodate those 
subjects too young to answer for themselves.  
 
2.3 Rat ionale for Subject Population 
This s
tudy will explore duration of response and evaluate the safety of remestemcel-L in 
pediatric subjects with aGVHD that has failed to respond to first-line systemic steroid treatment 
who participated in MSB-GVHD001.  The safety population will be comprised of any subject 
who re
ceived at least one infusion of remestemcel- L in MSB-GVHD001. Survival at Day 180 
will be evaluated.  Additionally, duration of response will be explored in subjects who completed 
initial therapy of remestemcel-L (first 8 doses) in MSB-GVHD001 and responded to therapy, in 
or
der to best assess the impact of a response to treatment of aGVHD.   
 
2.4 Rat ionale for Dosing Regimen and Treatment Period 
There is no treatment intervention in this study; all remestemcel-L dosing will have occurred in 
the MS
B-GVHD001 study. 
 
3. S TUDY OBJECTIVES 
3.1 Ob jectives 
In clinical studies, MSCs elicited improved clinical response over placebo in subjects with 
aGVHD, which will have been evaluated in the MSB-GVHD001 study.  Here in protocol MSB-
GV
HD002, w e will describe safety for the MSB-GVHD001 population through 180 days of 
re
mestemcel- L treatment and explore duration of response of treating aGvH D that has failed to 
respond to first-line steroid treatment in pediatric subject s.

Day 100 to Day 180.  
4. To assess the time to addition of any second-line GVHD treatment agent 
5. To assess the number of days to a GVHD flare 
6. To evaluate subjects for evidence of chronic GVHD. 
 
  
  
 
 
  
 
  
 
 
 
4. S TUDY DESIGN 
4.1 Overview of Study Design  
This is a 180-day safety follow-up study of MSB-GVHD001, which will also explore duration of 
re
sponse over time.  Subjects who participated in MSB-
GVHD001 and received at least one 
remestemcel-L infusion will be evaluated 
at baseline (Day 100) and at Days 120, 140, 160 and 
180 for safety endpoints.  Subjects who participa
ted in Protocol MSB-GVHD001and received 
the first 8 doses of remestemcel-L, as outlined in th at protocol, and showed overall response or 
VG
PR at Day 28 will be evaluated at baseline (Day 100) and at Days 120, 140, 160 and 180 after 
initial remestemcel-L infusion for evidence of duration of response over time.

study.  
 
5.3 P remature Subject Withdrawal 
S
ubjects may voluntarily withdraw from the study for any reason at any time.  Subjects may be 
also considered withdrawn if they state an intention to withdraw, fail to return for visits, or 
become lost to follow-up.   
At a minimum, the following should be collected when a subject withdraws: 
 The  reason the subject discontinued 
 The  date of the last assessment and/or contact   
 Adve rse events (AEs) , including concomitant medications used to treat AEs 
 F inal (end of study) assessments. 
 
5.4 L ost to Follow- Up 
A subject is considered to have been lost to follow-up if he/she is unable to be contacted by the 
investi
gator post randomization after reasonable efforts have been made to contact the subject.  
The
 investigator should show “due diligence” by documenting in the source documents steps 
taken to contact the subject, e.g., dates of telephone calls or  registered letters.  The end of 
participati
on for a subject lost to follow-up is the date of the last known contact (e.g., visit or 
tele
phone contact).

6. S TUDY PROCEDURE 
6.1 Visit Schedule and Assessments 
Table 6 lists all planned assessments, which are marked with an “X” when the visits are 
performed.  Subjects should be
 seen for a
ll visits on the designated day or at a time that is as 
close as possible to the designated day.  The study assessment schedule in Table 6 outlines all 
procedures to be performe
d on subjects at the scheduled visits.   
 
In order to minimize variability in evaluations, ideally, the same individuals should perform the 
same tests on all the subjects at a
 given trial site. 
The following assessments and procedures will
 be performed at study visits: 
 I nformed consent.  Subject may be consented on MSB-GVHD002 simultaneously when 
being provided with the MSB-GVHD001 consent, or at any visit up through Day 180 (± 
7 days). If the IRB/EC
 has not yet approved the consent for MSB-GVHD002 at Day 100 
(MSB-GVHD001), the Investigator should make all efforts to have the IRB/EC approved 
consent for MSB-GVHD002 presented to the subject no later than Day 180 (± 7 days).  
See Section 6.3 for additional information about handling of visits from Day 100 through 
Da
y 160 when an IRB/EC approved consent is not available. 
 R eview of inclusion / exclusion criteria 
 P hysical examination 
 He ight and weight 
 Vital signs (heart rate [HR], blood pressure [BP], temperature, and respiratory rate [RR]) 
 GV HD assessment (skin, lower GI, upper GI, liver) using the same method as that of 
MSB-GVHD001 
 O2 saturation by pulse oximetry (SaO 2/SAT) 
 Adve rse event (AE) assessment  
 I ncidence of chronic GVHD (cGVHD) (Appendix 8)  
 S urvival status  
 Information on hospitalization status (namely the date of hospitalization) 
 Steroid dose(s)  
 Prior and concomitant medications

6.1.1 S afety Assessments 
Many of the study assessments scheduled for Day 100 will be completed during the MSB-
GVHD001 protocol and, therefore, will not be completed at the Day 100 visit for this protocol. 
 
6.1.1.1 Physical Examination 
A physical examination, including
 but not limited to, examination for evidence of adverse 
events, will be performed at Day 120, Day 140, Day 
160, the end of study/Day 180, and at 
unscheduled visits as needed.     
 
I
nformation about physical examinations must be available
 in the source documentation at the 
study site.  Significant new findings made after the Day 100 visit
 that meet the definition of an 
AE or SAE must be recorded on the Adverse Event CRF.

 6.1.1.2 Vital Signs 
Vital sign measurements should be performed at Days 120, 140, 160, End Of Study/Day 180, 
and at unscheduled visits as needed. 
 
Mea
surements of vital signs will include sitting systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood 
pr
essure (DBP), heart rate (HR), temperature, and respiratory rate (RR).   
 
Vital si
gns will be measured after approximately 5 minutes of quiet rest with the subject in a 
sit
ting position.  Ideally, the site should have a dedicated blood pressure machine and use the 
sa
me machine and blood pressure measurement method for all subject s during the trial.  
 
6.1.1.3
 Oxygen Saturation 
Concurrent with vital sign measurements, Oxygen saturation (SaO 2/SAT) will be monitored by 
pulse oximetry.  Supplemental oxygen may be administered as needed but should be noted in the 
sourc
e documents 
 
6.1.1.4 Height and Weight 
Height and weight measurements should be performed at End of Study/Day 180 or at 
unscheduled visits as needed. 
 
Mea
surement of height from a standing position should be performed with the subject’s shoes 
removed, the knees straightened, and head held upright.  For infants, height should be measured 
lying down, a
nd measurements should be recorded as recumbent length.  
 
Mea
surement of weight should be performed without shoes or extra layers of clothing (e.g., 
swe
ater or jacket) during the measurement.  Subjects should be weighed on the same scales at all 
visi
ts. 
 
6.1.1.5 12-Lead Electrocardiogram (ECG) 
12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) will be performed at End of Study/Day 180 or at unscheduled 
visi
ts as neede
d, to assess any changes in cardiac physiology from prior measurements 
pe
rformed at Day 0 and Day 100 in MSB-GVHD001.  Subjects should be in a supine or semi-
supi
ne position for at least 5 minutes prior to the recording.  The same recording position (supine 
or
 semi-supine) and the same equipment should be used for each subject throughout the study.

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 40 of 79 Mesoblast  
 All ECG tracings must be (1) reviewed by a medically qualified member of the study team, (2) 
annotated to indicate any cli
nical finding, (3) signed and dated by the medically qualified 
member, and (4) filed with the notes for the subjects.  ECG parameters will be entered into the 
CRF , a
nd if any ECG abnorma
lity is associated with an (S) AE, it must be entered in the (S)AE 
CRF. 
 
Heart rate (HR), pulse rate ( PR), QRS and QT durations should also be noted on the CRF along 
with t
he ECG parameters. 
 
6.1.1.6 (Ser
ious) Adverse Events 
All (S)AEs, including those considered to have a causal relationship to the IMP, will be collected 
at each assessment time point.  (S)AEs collected will consist of both solicited and events 
voluntarily reported by
 the subjects. 
 
6.1.1.7 Pregnancy Tests 
A serum pregnancy test may be performed by the site personnel for all females of childbearing 
potential (subjects ≥10 years of age) Study/Day 180 and at unscheduled visits and at the 
I
nvestigator’s discretion, as needed.  Details on pregnancy testing requirements are located in 
Appendix 7.  
 
6.1.1.8 Laborator
y Evaluat
ions  
A designated laboratory
 (or laboratories) will perform the analyses of all specimens collected. 
Collection, shipment of samples, and reporting of results by the central or local (if needed) 
laboratory (or laboratories) will be detailed in the laboratory manual provided to the 
Investigators. If age/weight of the patient does not allow for this additional blood volume, then 
values from local labs will serve as the Day 160 values used for the present study.  The 
laboratory tests to be pe
rformed for subjects in this study are listed in Table 7.  
 
If necessary
, laboratory assessments may be performed by a laboratory other than the designated 
central laboratory.  
In this case, normal ranges of test values for th is laboratory should be 
pr
ovided to the sponsor. 
 
The Investigator at each site is required to review all clinically relevant laboratory results 
requested in the protocol and to record those results in the CRF.  The diagnosis associated with 
any clinically
 significant laboratory abnormalities should be recorded as an (S)AE on the CRF.

 6.1.1.9 Assessment of Ectopic Tissue Formation 
To detect any ectopic tissue formation, a radiologist and an Investigator at each study site may 
compare the optional CT scan or MRI performed during screening for MSB-GVHD001with the 
optional CT scan or MRI performed at end of study/Day 180 or  at an unscheduled visit to 
determine if there is ectopic tissue formation.  If applicable, the same method of radiologic scan 
shoul
d be used for both evaluations.  If the formation of ectopic tissue is suspected, further 
evaluation may
 include MRI or positron-emission tomography (PET) scanning, and possibly 
biopsy.

Clinical Study Protocol   
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 44 of 79 Mesoblast  
 6.5 Concomitant Medication and Supportive Therapy 
6.5.1 Standard of Care for aGVHD 
All enrolled subjects will continue to receive institutionally defined standard of care (i.e., 
maintenance of steroid treatment and other prophylactic treatment for aGVHD) as described in 
MSB-GVHD001. 
 
Investigators should provide standard of care treatment for viral infections as appropriate, 
including prophylaxis and treatment if there is evidence of viral reactivation and/or infection. 
 
6.5.2 Conco mitant Medications 
Subjects may continue to be treated with systemic steroid therapy and receive any second-line 
therapy as necessary at the discretion of the Investigator and per institutional guidelines. 
 
Information on all concomitant medicati
ons and therapy will be collected for this study.  All new 
pharmacologic and non-
pharmacologic treatment used by study subjects from Day 100 to Day 
180 should be recorded in the corresponding CRF.  Concomitant medications will be coded 
using the most recent WHO Dr
ug Dictionary (WHO- DD)52 and summarized by ATC code. 
 
6.5.3 S teroid Taper  
If continued steroid therapy is required, the dosing of methylprednisolone or equivalent may be 
tapered at the discretion of the Investigator.  A steroid taper rate of at least 10% of the dose per 
week but not to excee
d 25% of the dose per week is recommended as described in Appendix 6, 
with the goal of discontinuing ster
oid by 10 weeks after initiating taper. 
 
6.5.4 E scalating Therapy 
Protocol guidelines for escalating therapy of aGVHD for worsening disease include: 
1. Worsening of symptoms for at least 3 days, or  
2. Grades C-D aGVHD persisting for at least 1 week despite treatment, or  
3. Grade B aGVHD persisting for at least 2 weeks despite treatment. 
 
Escalation of therapy does not constitute withdrawal of a subject from the study. If escalation of 
therapy occurs, the 
subject is to continue on study and receive all assessments per protocol.

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 45 of 79 Mesoblast  
 6.5.5 Supportive Care 
In addition to prescribed investigational agent plus corticosteroids and prophylactic 
therapies, all subjects m ay receive  the following:  
 Tr ansfusion  support per institutional  practice. Type of transfusion and the number of units 
will be recorded in the eCRF. 
 Anti -infective prophylaxis directed towards: CMV,  gram positiv e (encapsulated) bacteria, 
pneumocystis carin ii and  fungal infections per institutional practice. 
 
7. S AFETY GUIDANCE 
7.1 Definitions  
7.1.1 Adver se Event 
An AE is defined by the International Conference of Harmonization (ICH) guideline for Good 
C
linical Practice as  any untoward medical occurrence in a subject administered a pharmaceutical 
product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment.  
 
An A
E can therefore be any of the following: 
 An y unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), 
symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether 
or not considered related to the medicinal product 
 An y new disease or exacerbation of an existing disease (a worsening in the character, 
frequency, or severity of a known condition)  
 R ecurrence of an intermittent medical condition (e.g., headache) not present at baseline  
 An y deterioration in a laboratory value or other clinical test (e.g., ECG, X-ray) that is 
associated with symptoms or leads to a change in study treatment or concomitant 
treatment or discontinuation from study drug. 
 
Adverse events that are related to a protocol-mandated intervention, including those that occur 
prior to assignment of study treatment (e.g., screening procedures such as biopsies etc.) are to be 
reported.  
 
Collection of all AEs will begin upon signing of the informed consent form (ICF).  Pre-existing 
conditions that worsen during a study are to be reported as AEs. 
  
MSB -GVHD002  Version  4.0 
Clinical Study Protocol   
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 47 of 79 Mesoblast  
 7.2 Relationship of Adverse Event to the IMP 
A determination will be made of the relationship between an adverse event and the IMP.  A 
causal relationship is pre
sent if a determination is made that there is a reasonable possibility  that 
the a
dverse event may have been caused by the IMP.  In general, a causal relationship will be 
assigned when evidence exists to support the causal relationship.  As there is no prescribed 
treatment inter
vention in this study, relationship would be extrapolated backwards to dosing in 
protocol MSB-GVHD001. 
 
When assessing a pote
ntial relationship between the IMP and an AE, the following parameters 
should be considered:
 
 T emporal relationship between IMP and/or protocol-specified procedures and the AE. 
 The  biological plausibility that the IMP caused the event 
 An y underlying/concurrent illness in the subject 
 C oncomitant medications the subject may have received  
 How  commonly the event occurs in the study population, independent of treatment. 
 
7.3 Re lationship to Study Procedure  
For each adverse event, the relationship to the IMP delivery procedure must be recorded as either 
related (there is re
asonable possibility of a causal relationship between the event and the study 
procedure) or n
ot related (there is no reasonable possibility of a causal relationship between the 
e
vent and the study proc
edure). 
 
8. REP ORTING ADVERSE EVENTS AND SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS 
Any adverse
 event (AE) occurring after a subject has signed the informed consent (or 
randomization, as app
ropriate) should be recorded on the appropriate CRF page. 
 
Any SAE (as described in S ection 7.1.2)  occurring after a subj ect has signed the informed 
c
onsent should be immediately reported to the sponsor or designee within 24 hours of the 
investigator’s knowledge of the event.  All subjects with an SAE must be followed up and the 
outcomes reported until t
he event is resolved or has stabilized.  
 
Upon occurrence of an SAE, the investigator must:  
 I mmediately notify the sponsor’s designee, Quintiles Lifecycle Safety. SAE reporting 
will originate in the e
lectronic data capture (EDC) system and an email will be sent to 
MSB -GVHD002  Version  4.0 
Clinical Study Protocol   
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 48 of 79 Mesoblast  
 individuals with designated responsibility for safety.  The paper SAE form is in place as a 
back -up in the rare event that EDC is not accessible to the reporter of the SAE:  
o  
 P rovide copy of all relevant source documents, including concomitant medications, as 
appropriate.     
 
All SAEs that are considered unexpected and related to the study product will be reported by the 
Sponsor or its designee as a 15
-day report to the Regulatory Authorities as applicable and to all 
participating investigators. 
 
SAEs that are considered unexpected, related to the study and are life threatening, or result in 
death will be reporte
d by the Sponsor or its designee to the appropriate Regulatory Authorities 
and to all participating investigators as a 7-day report. 
 
Each investigator must notify the IRB/EC responsible for reviewing the study at their site of all 
15-day or 7-day safety reports required by local regulations or IRB/EC requirements and shall 
pr
ovide the Sponsor or its desig
nee with written confirmation of said IRB/EC notification. 
 
8.1 P rocedures for Reporting Pregnancies  
All pregnancies that occur during the study are to be reported immediately to the individual 
identified in the General Information page of this protocol, and the investigator must provide 
Sponsor or designee
, by facsimile, a Pregnancy Tracking Form.  Pregnancies in female partners 
of male subjects are
 not required to be followed up.  All subjects who become pregnant will be 
monitored to the completi
on or termination of the pregnancy, including perinatal and neonatal 
outcome.  Monitoring of the subject should continue until conclusion of the pregnancy.  If the 
pregnancy is a
ssociated with an SAE (e.g. hemorrhage, spontaneous abortion), then in addition 
to the Pregn
ancy Form, a separate SAE form must be provided as described in Section 8. 
 
8.2 L aboratory Test Abnormalities 
Laboratory test results will appear on laboratory reports that are submitted directly from the 
central laborator
y.  Local laboratory results, if applicable, should be recorded on the CRF.  
  

MSB -GVHD002  Version  4.0 
Clinical Study Protocol   
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 49 of 79 Mesoblast  
 Any abnormal laboratory result that is clinically significant should be recorded as a single 
diag
nosis in the CRF.  An abnormal laboratory result is considered to be clinically significant if 
it
 meets one or more of the following conditions: 
 I s accompanied by clinical symptoms.  
 R equir es change in concomitant therapy (e.g. addition of, interruption of, discontinuation 
of
, or any other change in a concomitant medication, therapy or treatment). 
 
These conditions will apply to any protocol- and non-protocol - specified safety laboratory results 
fr
om tests performed after ICF signature that fall outside the laboratory reference range and are 
c
onsidered clinically significant.  These conditions will not apply to any abnormal laboratory 
re
sults that are outside the laboratory reference range, yet does not meet the criteria for clinical 
sig
nificance; these latter results will be analyzed and reported as laboratory abnormalities. 
I
n the event of clinically significant abnormal laboratory test values, the tests should be repeated 
and followed up until they have returned to the normal range and/or the abnormality is 
adequately explained or accounted for.  If an acceptable explanation is established, it should be 
rec
orded on the CRF.  
 
8.3 E xpedited Reporting to  Health Authorities, Investigators, Institutional Review 
Boards, and Ethics Committees 
The Sponsor will promptly evaluate all adverse events against cumulative product experience to 
quickly identify and communicate possible new safety findings to investigators, IRBs, IECs, and 
applicable health authorities based on applicable legislation. 
 
To determine reporting requirements for single adverse event cases, the Sponsor will assess the 
expectedness of these events using the following reference documents: 
 IMP IB 
 I MP Development Core Safety Information (DCSI) Document, if applicable.  
 
The Sponsor will compare the severity of each event and the cumulative event frequency 
reported for the study with the severity and frequency reported in the applicable reference 
document. 
 
Reporting requirements will also be based on the Investigator's assessment of causality and 
seriousness, with a provision for upgrading by the Sponsor as needed.

 9. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS AND ANALYTICAL PLAN 
9.1 Statistical Analysis Plan 
Since this is an extension trial of MSB-GVHD001, data presented for MSB-GVHD002 will be 
presented in two ways:  
1. For the extension period only. This will include assessments beyond Day 100. 
2. F or the entire period spanning both MSB -GVHD001 and MSB-GVHD002 trials.  
In particular, this includes time- to- event data (flares and therapy escalation), survival 
data, incidence of cGVHD, and frequency of flares. 
 
Categorical variables will be summarized using frequencies and percentages. Continuous 
variables will be summarized using descriptive statistics (n, mean, standard deviation [SD], 
media
n, minimum, and maximum). Confidence intervals, if presented, will have a two-sided 
95% 
confidence level. For time- to-event variables, Kaplan-Meier curves will be presented as 
appropriate.   
 
In general, the baseline value for a variable is defined as the last non-missing observation prior to 
or equal to the first dose date of study treatment in MSB-GVHD001.  Baseline for analyses of 
the e
ntire period of MSB-GVHD001 and MSB-GVHD002 will be the same as baseline defined 
for Protocol MSB-GVHD001.  The baseline for the extension period beyond Day 100 will be the 
sa
me values at the end of study/Day 100 for MSB-GVHD001.  Data collected at unscheduled 
ti
me points will not be summarized at the unscheduled time points.  
 
The actual day relative to start of treatment will be determined from the first dose date in 
Protocol MSB-GVHD001, which will be considered ‘Study Day 0’.  Study day will be calculated 
fr
om the first infusion date in Protocol MSB-GVHD001.  A detailed statistical analysis plan 
(SAP
) will be finalized prior to the database lock.  
 
9.2 Anal ysis Population 
The analysis population for safety in this study, the Safety Population, will include all subject s 
who r
eceived at least one dose of the study treatment in study MSB-GVHD001 and entered into 
stud
y MSB-GVHD002. The population to be evaluated for duration of response will include a ll 
subjects who participated in Protocol MSB-GVHD001, received the first 8 doses of 
re
mestemcel-L as outlined in that protocol, and showed overall response (OR) or very good 
partial response (VGPR) to remestemcel-L at Day 28.

 9.3 Demographic and Baseline Characteristics 
Pre-treatment demographics and subject characteristics will be summarized.  Descriptive 
statistics [e.g., number of subjects, mean, standard deviation (SD), median, minimum, and 
maximum] will be calculated for continuous variables [e.g. age and weight] and frequency 
counts will be tabulated for categorical demographic variables [e.g. gender, ethnicity, race, 
underlying malignancy or leukemic disease at transplant, donor type, donor compatibility, HSCT 
sourc
e, grade of aGVHD at onset, grade of aGVHD at baseline].  Time from HSCT to onset of 
a
GVHD and onset of aGVHD to initiation of study drug will be summarized. Involvement of the 
skin, 
lower gastrointestinal (GI) tract, and liver will be summarized by the number of subject s 
with one organ, two organs, or all three organs involved at baseline.  
 
9.4 S afety Data Analysis 
9.4.1 Adverse Events  and Serious Adverse Events 
All (serious) adverse events in this study will be collected from the time the subject signs the 
ICF.  All (S)AEs will be collected in this study and summarized by treatment, dose, and severity.  
Numbers and rates of TEAEs and other safety variables will be tabulated by organ system and 
preferred term. 
 
At each time point, vital signs and safety laboratory parameters will be tabulated.  The 
c
ontinuous variables will be summarized by the descriptive statistics – mean, standard deviation, 
media
n, minimum and maximum.  Additionally, vital signs and laboratory parameters will be 
a
ssessed for clinically significant abnormalities as well as shifts from baseline. 
 
9.4.2 S urvival to Day 180 
The number of subje
cts alive, deceased, lost to follow-up, or withdrawn from Day 0 (Protocol 
MS
B-GVHD001) to Day 180 (Protocol MSB-GVHD002) will be summarized in a Subject 
Disposition table.  For subjects who d ied, the time to event will be calculated from date of 
transplant, date of aGVHD onset, and date of treatment initiation.  All other subjects will be 
c
ensored and survival time will be calculated from the date of transplant, date of aGVHD onset, 
or date of treatment initiation to the date of last contact.

 9.4.3 Ectopic Tissue Formation 
To detect potential ectopic tissue formation, a radiologist and an Investigator at each study site 
ma
y compare the CT scan or MRI performed during screening with the CT scan or MRI those 
performed at study end,  if available, to determine if there is ectopic tissue formation.  The same 
method of radiologic scan should be used for both evaluations. If formation of ectopic tissue is 
suspected, further evaluation may include MRI or positron-emission tomography (PET) 
scanning, and possibly biopsy. 
 
As noted above, (S)AEs which represent ectopic tissue foci will be summarized by numbers and 
percenta
ges.

F
or each applicable time point, key laboratory data, vital signs and safety laboratory parameters 
will
 be tabulated.  Vital signs and laboratory parameters will be assessed for clinically significant 
abnormalities and shifts from baseline (baseline as obtained in protocol MSB-GVHD001) will be 
presented. 
 
9.5 S econdary Endpoints Analysis 
9.5.1 Asse ssment of Survival at Day 180 
Survival will be assessed from initial remestemcel-L treatment to the end of study/Day 180. The 
numbers with percentages for survival, non-survival, or missing, including lost to follow-up, will 
be summarized at Day 180.  For tabulating responders at Day 28 from the MSB-GVHD001 study 
versus survivors at Day 180 the present study, percentages of survivors and deaths will be based 
on all subjects, including those with missing survival information for the lost to follow-up or 
withdrawn subjects.  The association between Day 28 OR and survival at Day 180, and between 
Da
y 28 VGPR and survival at Day 180, will be tested for statistical significance.  First, the 
a
ssociations will be tested using a Cochran–Mantel–Haenszel  (CMH) test, stratifying by baseline 
aGVHD grade. Day 180 survival Kaplan-Meier curves will be plotted by Day 28 responder and 
non-responder groups, and differences between these groups will be tested for a ny statistically 
sig
nificant difference using the log-rank test. The odds ratio for survival at Day 180, given 
responder status at Day 28, will be presented and tested for statistical significance (whether 
statistically significantly greater than 1).

GVHD activity will be assessed and summarized at time points evenly divided amongst the term 
from Day 100 to Day 180, specifically at Days 120, 140, 160 and 180 , relative to baseline 
a
ssessment in MSB-GVHD001. 
 
9.5.3 S teroid Dose 
Steroid doses at Days 120, 140, 160 and 180, including proportion of subjects able to taper 
steroids by 50% by each time point will be summarized.  Guideline for steroid taper is located in 
Appendix 6.  
 
9.5.4 G VHD Flares 
The numbers with the percentages of GVHD flares will be summarized and presented.  The time 
to a GVHD flare from the D
ay 0 and Day 100 will be determined and summarized with a 
Kaplan-Meier curve. 
 
9.5.5 S econd-line Treatment 
The number of days to addition of any second-line GVHD treatment agent, from Day 100 in the 
present study, will be determined a
nd summarized by the mean, standard deviation, median, 
minimum and maximum .  The number of second-line treatments used will also be determined 
a
nd descriptively summarized.  
 
9.5.6 Chroni c GVHD 
Subjects will be evaluated for evidence of chronic GVHD at any time from Day 0 to D ay 180.  
The
 time to first sign of chronic GVHD will be summarized.  The number and percentage of 
subjects developing cGVHD will
 be tabulated for the overall safety population as well as for the 
population stratified by baseline GVH
D grade, number of infusions received, and Day 28 
responder/non-responder categories.

 10. DATA COLLECTION, MANAGEMENT AND QUALITY ASSURANCE 
The overall procedures for quality assurance of clinical study data are described in the Sponsor’s 
(or designee’s) Standard Operational Procedures (SOPs). 
 
Data for this study
 will be recorded using electronic Case Report Forms (eCRFs).     
 
The site is expected to r
espond to all SAE queries within 24 hours and to all other queries within 
5 business days.  
A Mesoblast representative or a designee will perform final data review and 
externa
l data reconciliations prior to all major milestones, including database close and lock. 
 
10.1 Assign ment of Preferred Terms and Original Terminology 
For classification purposes, preferred terms will be assigned by the Sponsor to the original terms 
entered on the CRF (CTCAE terms), using the most up- to-date version of the Medical Dictionary 
for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA)54 terminology for adverse events and diseases and for 
treatments and surgical and medical procedures. 
 
11. S TUDY COMMITTEES 
11.1 Independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) 
The Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) is a multidisciplinary group that is independent 
of both the sponsor and CR
O, which consists of one biostatistician and physicians with expertise 
in relevant disciplines, w
ho collectively have experience in the management of clinical trial 
subject.  The DSMB is also knowledgeable in the conduct and monitoring of randomized clinical 
trials.

12. L AWS, REGULATIONS, AND ETHICS 
12.1 Local Regulations/Declaration of Helsinki 
This clinical study shall be conducted in full compliance with current material and relevant laws 
and regulations and investigators will use best efforts to ensure such compliance.  This clinical 
study will also be conducted in 
compliance with principles outlined in the “Guideline for Good 
Clinical Prac
tices” ICH tripartite Guideline55 and with the ethical principles of the “Declaration 
of
 Helsinki”56  or with the laws and regulations of the country in which the research is 
c
onducted, including but not limited to the EU Clinical Trial Directive .57   
 
12.2 In formed Consent  
It is the responsibility of the investigator, or a person designated by the investigator, if local 
regulations permit, to obtain signed informe
d consent from each subject prior to the subject’s 
participation in this study after a
dequate explanation of the aims, methods, anticipated benefits, 
and potential hazards of the study.  For subjects who are not qualified to or are incapable of 
giving legal consent, writ
ten consent must be obtained from a legally acceptable representative.  
In cases where both the subject and his/her legal representative are unable to read, an impartial 
witness must be present during the entire
 informed consent discussion.  After the subject and 
representative have orally c
onsented to participation in the trial, the witness’ signature on the 
form would attest that the information in the consent form was accurately explained and 
understood.  The investigator or designee must also explain that the subjects are free to refuse to 
enter or withdraw from the study at any time and for any reason that a copy of the consent would 
be provided to the subject, and that the proc
ess b
y which consent is obtained is described in the 

MSB -GVHD002  Version  4.0 
Clinical Study Protocol   
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 57 of 79 Mesoblast  
 source documentation.  The CRFs for this study would contain a section for documenting subject 
informed consent, which  must be completed appropriately.  If new safety information results in 
significant changes in the benefit/risk assessment, the consent form should be reviewed and 
updated if necessary.  All subjects, including those already being treated, should be informed of 
the ne
w information, provided with a copy of the revised form, and give their consent to continue 
in t
he study in accordance with the IRB/EC requirements. 
 
S
ubjects will authorize the use of their protected health information during the informed consent 
process in accordance with the applicable privacy requirements (e.g., HIPAA, local Regulatory 
Agency).  Subject s who de ny permission to use and disclose protected health information w ill 
not be eligible to participate in the study.  The Investigator will ensure that study documents 
for
warded to Mesoblast and any other documents contain no mention of subject names. 
 
12.3 In stitutional Review Board/ Ethics Committees (IRB/EC) 
This protocol an d any modifications, appropriate consent procedures, or accompanying material 
pr
ovided to the subject, such as subject information sheets or descriptions of the study used to 
obtain infor
med consent and advertisements or compensation given to the subject, will be 
reviewed and approved by appropriate Competent Authority and IRBs/ECs.  
 
Before initiation of the trial at each investigational site, approval from the appropriate IRB/EC 
must be obtained.  Written approval must be obtained before a trial site is initiated or the 
investi
gational product is released to the investigator.  
 
Any extensions or renewals of IRB/EC approval must be obtained during the course of the study.  
I
f required, approvals must also be obtained for any changes to the protocol, the informed 
consent form, the written information provided to subjects and/or other procedures. 
 
Any new information that may adversely affect the safety of the subjects or the conduct of the 
study will be reported promptly to the IRB/EC by the Investigator and/or the Sponsor, in 
a
ccordance with applicable local requirements.  Written summaries of the study status will be 
subm
itted to the IRB/EC annually, or more frequently if required by the EC/IRB. On completion 
of the study, the IRB/EC will be notified that the study has ended.

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 58 of 79 Mesoblast  
 12.4 Protocol Adherence 
Investigators will ensure that due diligence is applied in order to avoid protocol deviations. All 
significant protocol deviati
ons will be reported to the IRB/EC in accordance with IRB/EC 
requirements.  All significant protocol deviations will be recorded and reported in the CSR. 
 
12.5 P rotocol Deviation   
A protocol deviation is defined as a
n intentional or unintentional change or non-compliance with 
a research protocol. 
 
13. COND ITIONS FOR MODIFYING THE PROTOCOL 
Requests from investigators to modify the protocol for ongoing studies will be considered only 
with consultation between an a
ppropriate representative of the Sponsor and the Investigator .  
P
rotocol modifications must be prepared by a representative of the Sponsor and initially 
reviewed and approved by the Sponsor. 
 
All protocol modifications must be submitted to the appropriate IRB/EC for information and 
approval in accordance with local requirements, and to Regulatory Agencies if required.  Approval 
must be obtained before any changes can be implemented, with the exception of changes necessary 
to elim
inate an immediate hazard to trial subjects, or change(s) involving only logistical or 
administrative aspects of the trial (e.g. change in monitor[s], change of telephone number[s]). 
 
14. COND ITIONS FOR TERMINATING THE STUDY 
Mesoblast reserves the right to terminate the study at any time under the conditions specified in 
the Clinical Trial Agreement.  In the event the trial is terminated before the planned completion 
date, action will be taken to assure the protection of the subjects’ interests. 
 
14.1 Enrollment Hold and Stopping Rules 
Subject safety will be continuously monitored.  The investigator site will report all SAEs, 
including all deaths i
mmediately as outlined in Section 8. 
 
Additionally, all
 AEs including all deaths will be periodically reported to the DSMB as per the 
DSMB charter.  Th
e DSMB will investigate these complications through a complete safety 
review.  The DSM
B will then determine whether enrollment should be continued, suspended, or 
terminated and their de
cision will be communicated to the Sponsor.

15. S TUDY DOCUMENTATION, CRFS, AND RECORD KEEPING 
15.1 In vestigator's Files / Retention of Documents 
The Investigator must maintain adequate and accurate records to enable the conduct of the study 
to be fully documented and the study data to be subsequently verified.  These documents should 
be classified into two different separate categories, consisting of: 1) An Investigator's Study File 
and 2) subject clinical source documents. 
 
The
 Investigator's Study File will contain the protocol/amendments and schedule of assessments, 
IRB/EC and governmental approval with correspondence, sample informed consent, drug 
re
cords, staff curriculum vitae, authorization forms,  and other appropriate 
documents/correspondence.  In addition, at the end of the study the Investigator will receive the 
subj
ect data, including an audit trail containing a complete record of all changes to data, query 
re
solution correspondence,  and reasons for changes, in a readable format on CD that must be 
ke
pt with the Investigator’s Study File. 
 
Subject clinical source documents may include subject hospital/clinic records, physician's and 
nurse
's notes, appointment book, original laboratory reports, ECG, special assessment reports, 
signed informed consent forms, and consultant letters.  The Investigator must keep the 
I
nvestigator’s Study File and subject clinical source documents (including the archival CD) on 
file for at least 15 years after completion or discontinuation of the study, or in accordance with 
ICH guidelines and local regulations, whichever is of greater duration.  After this specified time 
period, the documents ma
y be destroyed.  Study sites must notify the sponsor prior to destroying 
a
ny trial-related documents. 
 
Should the Investigator wish to assign the study records to another party or move them to another 
location, the Sponsor must be notified in advance. 
 
If the Investigator cannot guarantee compliance with this archiving requirement at the 
investigational site for any or all of the documents, special arrangements must be made between 
the Investigator and the Sponsor to store these documents in a sealed container(s) outside of the 
sit
e in order to ensure that they can be returned sealed to the Investigator in the event of a 
regulatory audit.  Where source documents are required for continued care of subjects, 
appropriate copies should be made for storing outside of the site. 
MSB -GVHD002  Version  4.0 
Clinical Study Protocol   
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 60 of 79 Mesoblast  
 15.2 Source Documents and Background Data 
The Investigator shall provide to the Sponsor, upon request, any required background data from 
the stud
y documentation or clinic records.  This is particularly important in cases where errors in 
data transcription are suspected.  In cases of special problems and/or governmental queries or 
re
quests for audit inspections, it is also necessary for the Sponsor to have direct access to the 
complete study records, provided that subject confidentiality is protected. 
 
15.3 Aud its and Inspections 
Source documents for this trial must be made available by the Investigator to appropriately 
qualified personnel from the Sponsor’s (or designee's) Quality Assurance Unit or its designees or 
to hea
lth authority inspectors, upon appropriate notification.  Verification of the CRF data must 
be by direct inspection of source documents. 
 
15.4 E lectronic Case Report Forms  
Data for this study will be captured via an Electronic Data Capture (EDC) system using eCRFs.  
The data will be entered into the EDC system by trained site personnel per the eCRF Completion 
Guidelines.  An audit trail will maintain a record of initial entries and changes made; reasons for 
change; time and date of entry; and user name of person authorizing entry or change.   
 
An eCRF must be completed for each subject. For each screen-failed subject, the reason for 
sc
reen failure will be collected in the termination eCRF along with the corresponding screen 
failure reason.  The entire subject casebook of data must be reviewed and electronically signed 
b
y the PI or by an authorized delegate from the study staff.  This also applies to records for those 
randomized subjects who fail to complete the study.  If a subject withdraws early from the study, 
the reason must be noted in the termination eCRF.  If a subject is withdrawn from the study 
be
cause of a treatment-limiting AE, attempts should be made to clearly document the outcome. 
 
The
 Investigator should ensure the accuracy, completeness, and timeliness of the data reported to 
the sponsor
 in the eCRFs and in all required reports.  
 
16. M ONITORING OF STUDY 
The Sponsor’s responsible monitor (or designee) will contact and visit the Investigator regularly 
a
nd will be permitted, upon request, to inspect the trial records, including CRFs and other 
pe
rtinent data,  provided that subject confidentiality is maintained in accordance with local 
re
quirements. 
MSB -GVHD002  Version  4.0 
Clinical Study Protocol   
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 61 of 79 Mesoblast  
 It will be the monitor's responsibility to inspect the CRFs at regular intervals throughout the 
study to ensure protocol a
dherence and that the data entered on the CRFs are complete, 
consistent, and accurate.  The monitor must verify that the subject received the study drug 
assigned by the r
andomization center (by controlling the written confirmation of the 
randomization by central randomization system).  The monitor will also have access to 
laboratory test reports and other subject records as applicable needed to verify entries on the 
CRF s.  The Investigator 
(or deputy) must agree to cooperate with the monitor to ensure that any 
problems detected in the course of these
 monitoring visits are resolved. 
 
17. CONF IDENTIALITY OF TRIAL DOCUMENTS AND SUBJECT RECORDS 
The Investigator must 
ensure that subject anonymity is maintained and that subject identity is 
pr
otected from unauthorized parties.  O
n CRFs or other documents submitted to the sponsor, 
subjects should be referenced by  an identification code rather than by their names.  The 
Investigator should keep a 
subject enrollment log showing codes, names and addresses.  The 
Investigator should mainta
in documents that will not be submitted to the Sponsor (e.g., subjects’ 
written consent forms) in strict c
onfidence. 
 
18. P UBLICATION OF DATA AND PROTECTION OF TRADE SECRETS 
18.1 Righ t to Publish 
Subject to the restrictions in this Article 18 and processes described in this Section 19, 
Inve
stigator may individuall
y communicate, orally present or publish in scientific journals or 
other scholarly media the Study results.  Sponsor retains all right and title to, as well as interest 
in, the Study data and case report forms.  Authorship will be determined by mutual agreement 
a
ccording to guidelines p
ublished by the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors 
(ICMJE) .58  
 
18.2 P ublication Steering Committee 
A Publication Steering Commit
tee (the “Committee”),  comprised of lead investigators who are 
appointed by the Sponsor will be responsible for the creation, review, and submission of 
publications and prese
ntations relating to the Study (e.g., primary manuscript on design, baseline 
data, mortality, eff
icacy, and safety data), sub-study, and ancillary analyses after completion of 
the Study.  The Commit
tee will encourage and support other manuscript(s) for 
publication, content for s
peaking engagements, abstracts of papers, poster presentations and 
similar material by the
 Study Center and/or Investigator as deemed appropriate by the 
MSB -GVHD002  Version  4.0 
Clinical Study Protocol   
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 62 of 79 Mesoblast  
 Committee.  Committee review and approval must be obtained prior to submission of any 
publication or
 public display of the Study results, alone or in aggregate.   
 
18.3 P rocedure   
Investigator shall provide Sponsor with a written copy of any proposed publication or other 
disclosure of the Study results, including disclosures at research seminars, lectures and 
professional meetings and submission of papers for publication, at least sixty (60) days prior to 
submission for publication or disclosure so that Sponsor may have a reasonable opportunity 
to:  (i) review and comment on the contents of the proposed publication or disclosure; 
(ii)
 identify any trade secrets, proprietary information or Confidential Information (other than the 
Study results themselves) of Sponsor to be deleted from the proposed publication or disclosure; 
and (iii) protect proprietary rights to Inventions or products developed or investigated under the 
Study.  Sponsor sha
ll provide, in writing, any comments to Investigator and/or identify any of the 
Sponsor’s trade sec
rets, proprietary information or Confidential Information (other than the 
Study results themselves) to be edited from the proposed publication or disclosure within the 
sixty (60) day period.  Upon Sponsor’s reasonable request, Investigator shall delay publishing or 
disclosure for a p
eriod not to exceed one hundred twenty (120) days from the date of receipt of 
such materials by Sponsor to permit the Sponsor to file patent applications or otherwise seek 
proprietary protection of subject matter disclosed in any proposed publication or other 
disclosure.  In addition, Investigator shall give due regard to Sponsor’s legitimate interests, such 
as manuscript authorship, coordina
ting and maintaining the proprietary nature of submissions to 
Regulatory Authorities, and coordinating with other ongoing studies in the same field, and agree 
to accept Sponsor’s reasonable comments and suggestions with respect to such publications or 
disclosures. 
 
Investigator and Study Center acknowledge that the Study is part of a multicenter study.  
Accordingly and notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Study Center and/or 
Investigator shall not publish or present the Study results until after the first publication, primary 
manuscript, or presentation regarding the overall study is completed, the results of the Study 
from all the sites have been published in a single publication or eighteen (18) months after 
acceptance of the manuscript or the conclusion of the Study at all Study sites whichever occurs 
earliest, the.  Thereafter, Study Center and/or Investigator may publish or disclose Study results 
in accordance with the provisions of this Section 18.

 19. STUDY COMPLETION 
Mesoblast reserves the right to terminate this protocol prematurely for reasonable cause provided 
that written notices are submitted a reasonable time in advance of the intended termination. The 
Investigator may also terminate the protocol at his or her site for reasonable cause, after 
providing written notice to Mesoblast a reasonable time in advance of the intended termination. 
Adva
nce notice is not required by either party if the protocol is stopped due to safety concerns. If 
Mesoblast terminates the protocol for safety reasons, it will immediately notify the Investigator 
by telephone and subsequently provide written instructions for termination. If the Investigator 
e
lects to terminate the study at his or her site, the Investigator will be responsible for returning all 
investi
gational products and study-related documents to Mesoblast in a timely manner. Source 
doc
uments supporting study-related data must be retained by the Investigator as previously 
described.

 Appendix 7:  Childbearing Potential, Pregnancy Testing, and Contraception 
All
 women of childbearing potential (including those who have had a tubal ligation) will have a 
se
rum pre
gnancy
 test at Screening.  Post-screening, a urine pregnancy test will be performed at 
Da
y 56, Day 100, and at any unscheduled visits under protocol MSB-GVHD001.  On protocol 
MSB-GVHD002, a urine pregnancy test will be performed at End of Study/Day 180 and at any 
unscheduled visit. If the urine pregnancy test is positive, the r esult must be con firm ed by a serum 
pr
egnancy test ( conducted by the cen tral labor atory).1 
 
All
 female patients are consider ed to be of childbearing potenti al u nless they m eet one of th e 
followi ng  criteria: 
 T he p atien t has been post-menopausal (amenorrhei c ) for  at least 1 year 
 T he p atien t had a surgical bilater al oophorectomy (with or wit hout hysterectomy) mor e 
than 6 weeks prior to enrollment 
 The patient had a hysterectomy.  
 
F
emale patients of reproductive or childbearing potenti al who are u nwilling to use a 
highl y e ffectiv e method of contraception fo r the duration of the study will be excluded fro m 
study participation.2 
 
Examples of highly effec tiv e con traception include the following: 
 Abstinence  
 Contraceptive pil l or transdermal patch  
 Single barrier plus spe rmicide  
 I ntrau terine d evice 
 Implants for co nt r aception  
 Injectio ns for co ntrace ption (with prolo nged release)  
 Hormonal vaginal devi ce 
 Sterilization, sur g ical tubal ligatio n 
 S o le sexual partner consisting of surgically sterilized male pa rtner with appropriate post- 
sur
gical verification o f t he absence o f spermatozoa in the eja culate. 
Patients may
 provide verbal confirmation that the pa rtner comp leted appropriate follow-up aft er 
vasectomy

a AP may be elevated in growing children, and not reflective of liver dysfunction.   
b Pulmonary scoring should be performed using both the symptom and pulmonary function testing (PFT) scale 
whenever possible.  When discrepancy exists between pulmonary symptom or PFT scores, the higher value should 
be used for final scoring.  Scoring using the lung function score (LFS) is preferred, but if DLCO is not available, 
grading using FEV 1 should be used.  The LFS is a global assessment of lung function after the diagnosis of 
bronchiolitis obliterans has already been established.  The percent predicted FEV 1 and DLCO (adjusted for 
hematocrit but not alveolar volume) should be converted to a numeric score as follows: ≥80%=1; 70-79%=2; 60-
69%=3; 50-59%=4; 40-49%=5; <40%=6.  The LFS= FEV 1 score+DLCO score, with a possible range of 2-12.   
 
ADL=activities of daily living; ALT=alanine aminotransferase; AP=alkaline phosphatase; AST=aspartate 
aminotransferase; BSA=body surface area; DLCO=diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide; 
ECOG=Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group; FEV 1=forced expiratory volume in 1 second; KPS=Karnofsky 
Performance Scale; LFS =lung function score; LFTs=liver function  tests; LPS=Lansky Performance Scale; 
ROM=range of motion; ULN=upper limit of the normal range.

 Based on observations checked in the above table, select the severity of chronic GVHD for this 
assessment.   
 
 None 
 
 Mild chronic GVHD involves only 1 or 2 organs or sites (except the lung: see Note), with no 
clinically significant functional impairment (maximum of score 1 in all affected organs or sites).   
 
 Moderate chronic GVHD involves (1) at least 1 organ or site with clinically significant but no 
major disability (maximum score of 2 in any affected organ or site) or (2) 3 or more organs or 
sit
es with no clinically significant functional impairment (maximum score of 1 in all affected 
organs or sites).  A lung score of 1 will also be considered moderate chronic GVHD.   
 
 Severe chronic GVHD indicates major disability caused by chronic GVHD (score of 3 in any 
organ or site).  A lung score of 2 or greater will also be considered severe chronic GVHD.   
 
Note: A lung score of 1 will also be considered moderate chronic GVHD.  Severe chronic 
GVHD indicates major disability caused by chronic GVHD (score of 3 in any organ or site).  A 
lung score of 2 or greater will also be considered severe chronic GVHD.

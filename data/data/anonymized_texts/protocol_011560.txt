Phase of Development:   4 
Clinical Sites:   1 to 2 sites in United States  
Objectives:  
Primary : 
The primary objectives of this study are to  estimate infant exposure to bempedoic acid or bempedoic 
acid and  ezetimibe : 
• estimate the daily infant dosage and relative infant dose (RID) of bempedoic acid in mature 
breast milk after administration of bempedoic acid  for 6  consecutive days , and 
• estimate the daily infant dosage and RID of bempedoic acid and ezetimibe in mature breast milk 
after administration of bempedoic acid/ezetimibe FCDP for 6 consecutive days.  
Secondary : 
The secondary objectives of this study are to  characterize the excretion of bempedoic acid  or 
bempedoic acid  and ezetimibe  in mature breast milk of healthy lactating women who receive a once 
daily dose of bempedoic acid  or bempedoic acid/ezetimibe FCDP for 6 consecutive days : 
• determine concentrations o f bempedoic acid, active  metabolite ESP15228  and bempedoic acid 
glucuronide  in mature breast milk collected over 24  hours from healthy subjects administered 
bempedoic acid  or bempedoic acid/ezetimibe FCDP , and  
• determine concentrations of ezetimibe  and metabolite ezetimibe -glucuronide in mature breast 
milk collected over 24 hours from healthy subjects administered bempedoic acid/ezetimibe 
FCDP.  
Safety : 
The safety objective of this study is  to evaluate the safety of 6 consecutive doses of bempedoic a cid 
or bempedoic acid/ezetimibe FCDP in healthy lactating women.  
Study Design:  
This is a Phase 4, open -label study that will estimate the daily infant dosage  and RID of bempedoic acid 
and bempedoic acid/ezetimibe in the mature breast milk of healthy wome n who have  receiv ed 6 daily 
doses of  bempedoic acid or bempedoic acid/ezetimibe  FCDP .  The excretion of bempedoic acid, 
ezetimibe, and metabolites ESP15228 , bempedoic acid glucuronide , and ezetimibe -glucuronide will be 
characterized  in mature breast milk .  Healthy lactating women who choose to stop breastfeeding their 
infant for the duration of the Treatment and Washout Period s will be eligible to participate once all

Confidential   Page 3 of 67 enrollment criteria are met.  The Screening Period will be up to 42 days followed by a 6 -day Treatment 
Period and a 7 -day Washout Period.  Subjects will be contacted by phone as a Post-treatment Follow -up 
Visit on Day 13.  Once the call is complete, subjects may resume feeding their infant breast milk that is 
currently being produced.  
Screening  Period :  The Screening Period will begin with a Screening Visit (Visit S1) that will occur up 
to 42 days prior to randomization (Visit T1) .  Visit S1 will allow the Investigator to assess the subject’s 
eligibility  and current breastfeeding practices .  After the subject provides written informed consent, the 
subject will undergo screening assessments as outlined in Appendix  1.  Study staff will sched ule a n 
optional  lactation consultant visit for those subjects who desire  support  related to feeding/care of the 
infant such as preparing for the treatment and washout period s of the study , pumping breast milk for 
storage , introducing infant formula , introducing bottle feeding  or resuming breastfeeding after Day 13 
(FU1). Additional  lactation consultant visits may be schedule d for subjects  anytime throughout the study.  
 
Treatment  Period :  Subjects who meet all eligibility criteria will be instructed to report to the clinical 
research unit (CRU) on Day 1  (Visit T1) .  Subjects who continue to meet eligibility criteria must confirm  
their infant is able to feed from a bottle , adequate stored breast milk and/or infant  formula is available to 
feed the infant for the duration of the study , and the subject is maintain ing adequate  breast  milk 
production.  If a subject is weaning, duration of weaning will be documented.  Subjects will then be 
randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either bempedoic acid  (Cohor t 1) or bempedoic acid/ezetimibe FCDP  
(Cohort 2).   Eight subjects  will be in each cohort.   While at the CRU, subjects will provide a predose 
blood sample for  pharmacokinetic ( PK) and safety laboratories.  Subjects will use an electric breast pump 
to provide a predose breast milk sample and will then receive the first dose of investigational medicinal 
product  (IMP ).  When Visit T1 assessments are complete, subjects will be provided with adequate IMP 
supply to support once -daily dosing on Days 2, 3, 4 and 5  by self  administration - at home .  Subjects will 
be reminded that their infant(s) must not be fed with  their breast milk that is produced after the first dose 
of IMP through Day 13 of the Washout Period .  On Day 2 through Day 5 study staff will contact each 
subject by phone to ensure IMP is taken appropriately and remind the subject to discard breast milk that 
is produced after the first dose of IMP.  In addition, subjects will document the day and time of when 
IMP was taken for Day 2 through Day 5 in the Study Drug Diary .  On the evening of Day  5 (Visit T2) , 
subjects will check -in to the CRU for 2 overnights  (with Sponsor approval, subjects may check -in to the 
CRU on the morning of Day 6 ).  Subjects must su bmit their Study Drug Diary at CRU check -in.  Study 
staff will review the diary and assess IMP adherence.  On the morning of Day 6, subjects will pump both 
breasts with an electric pump until completely emptied.  When pumping is complete, Cohort 1  subjects 
will receive the Day  6 dose of bempedoic acid and Cohort 2 subjects will receive the Day 6 dose of  
bempedoic acid/ezetimibe FCDP .  Breast milk will be collected from each subject  over the next 24 hours 
using an electric pump at 3, 6, 9, 12, 16, 2 0 and 24 hours (±30  minutes) after Day 6  dose administration .  
Both breasts will be emptied completely during each collection.  At each sampling time point, milk 
collected from each breast will be mixed together and the total volume measured and recorded.  On Day

Confidential   Page 4 of 67 7, blood will be collected approximately 24 hours after Day 6 dos ing for PK and safety labora tory 
samples.   Subjects will be discharged from the CRU on the morning of Day 7 after breast milk collection 
and completion of Day 7 assessments .  Subjects will be instructed to continue to pump and discard breast 
milk during the remainder of the Washout Period through Day 13.  
Follow -up Period :  On Day 13, all subjects will be contacted by phone as a post -treatment Follow -up 
Visit (Visit FU1/End -of-Study [EOS] ).  Breastfeeding may resume after Visit FU1  on Day 13.  An 
optional lactation consultant visit will be scheduled  for those subjects who desire to re -establish 
breastfeeding.  On Day 43 (FU2), study staff will contact subjects by phone to assess for SAEs and if the 
patient was able to resume breastfeeding (if intended).  
 
Number of Subjects (planned):   Approximately 16 (8 bempedoic acid  [Cohort 1]  and 8  bempedoic 
acid/ezetimibe FCDP  [Cohort 2] ) healthy lactating female subjects will be enrolled.  If a subject 
discontinues the study early or does not receive 6 daily doses of IMP or does not complete the 24 -hour 
breast milk collection after Day 6 dosing,  a replacement subject will be enrolled and assigned to the same 
treatment.

Bempedoic acid (ETC -1002) is an oral, first -in class, small molecule that inhibits adenosine 
triphosphate -citrate lyase (ACL), an enzyme upstream of 3 -hydroxy -3-methylglutaryl coenzyme 
A (HMG -CoA) reductase in the cholesterol  biosynthesis pathway. Bempedoic acid, like statins, 
up-regulates  low density lipoprotein cholesterol  (LDL -C) receptors.  
Bempedoic acid 180 mg and bempedoic acid  180 mg/ezetimibe 10  mg fixed combination drug 
product (FCDP), under the marketed names of Nexl etol® and Nexlizet®, respectively, have been 
approved by the United States (US) Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as an adjunct to diet 
and maximally tolerated statin therapy for the treatment of heterozygous familial 
hypercholesterolemia or established a therosclerotic cardiovascular disease in adults who require 
additional lowering of LDL -C (Nexletol 2020 USPI ; Nexlizet 2020 USPI ). In the European 
Union (EU) bempedoic acid and bempedoic acid /ezetimib e fixed combination medicinal product 
(FCMP) have been approved by the European Commission and are marketed under the names 
Nilemdo® and Nustendi®, respectively, for the treatment of primary hypercholesterolemia 
(heterozygous familial and non -familial) or mixed dyslipidemia as an adjunct to diet: in 
combination with a statin or statin with other lipid -lowering therapies in adults unable to reach 
LDL -C goals with the maximum tolerated dose of statin, or alone or in combination with other 
lipid-lowering thera pies in patients who are statin -intolerant or for whom a statin is 
contraindicated. Additionally, Nustendi is indicated in patients already being treated with the 
combination of bempedoic acid and ezetimibe as separate tablets with or without statin 
(Nilemdo  2020 SmPC ; Nustendi 2020 SmPC ). 
Bempedoic acid and bempedoic acid/ezetimibe FCDP have been studied in adults with  
heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia  (HeFH ) or established atherosclerotic car diovascular 
disease ( ASCVD ) who require additional LDL -C lowering but data do not exist for lactating 
women who may choose to continue breastfeeding their infant in conjunction with bempedoic 
acid or bempedoic acid/ezetimibe FCDP therapy.  There is no info rmation regarding the 
excretion of bempedoic acid  in human or animal milk, the effects of bempedoic acid  on the 
breastfed infant, or the effects of bempedoic acid  on milk production.  Bempedoic acid decreases 
cholesterol synthesis and possibly the synthesi s of other biologically active substances derived 
from cholesterol and theoretically may cause harm to the breastfed infant.  In addition, it is not 
known whether ezetimibe i s excreted into human milk.  In rat studies, exposure to total ezetimibe  
in nursin g pups was up to half of that observed in maternal plasma (Zetia 2020  USPI ). 
The USPI s for bempedoic acid  (Nexletol 2020  USPI ) and bempedoic acid/ezetimibe FCDP 
(Nexlizet 2020 USPI ) note breastfeeding is not recommended with either therapy and the SmPCs 
for bempedoic acid  (Nilemdo  2020  SmPC ) and bempedoic acid/ezetimibe FCMP (Nustendi 2020  
SmPC ) state breastfeeding is c ontraindicated.   As a result of the current labeling in conjunction 
with the paucity of data, patients, along with their health care providers, must make decisions 
about bempedoic acid  and bempedoic acid/ezetimibe FCDP therapy during lactation with a lack 
of evidence -based data regarding the excretion of bempedoic acid  or bempedoic acid  and 
ezetimibe  into breast milk and the potential exposure to the breast fed infant.

Confidential   Page 18 of 67 4.1 Study Rationale  
This Phase 4 study is designed to characterize the excretion of bempedoic acid o r bempedoic 
acid and ezetimibe  into mature breast milk of healthy lactating women and assess the exposure to 
the breast fed infant by estimating the daily infant dosage and the relative infant dose (RID) of 
bempedoic acid  or bempedoic acid  and ezetimibe  in breast milk after 6 consecutive daily doses 
of bempedoic acid  or bempedoic acid/ezetimibe FCDP.  
4.2 Background of Bempedoic Acid and Bempedoic Acid/Ezetimibe FCDP  
Bempedoic acid is an ACL inhibitor that lowers LDL -C by inhibition of cholesterol synthesis in 
the liver.  Adenosine triphosphate -citrate lyase is an enzyme upstream of HMG -CoA reductase in 
the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway.  Bempedoic acid and its active metabolite ESP15228  
require coenzyme A (CoA)  activation by very long -chain acyl -CoA synthetase 1 (ACSVL1) to 
ETC -1002 -CoA and ESP 15228 -CoA, respectively.  Inhibition of ACL by ETC -1002 -CoA 
results in decreased cholesterol synthesis in the liver and lowers LDL -C in blood via 
upregulation of low -density lipoprotein receptors.  
Bempedoic acid and bempedoic acid/ezetimibe FCDP have been approved by the FDA and 
European Medicines  Agency ( EMA ) based on the positive safety and efficacy profiles of large 
Phase 3 programs that evaluated adults with primary an d secondary hyperlipidemia who required 
additional LDL -C lowering.  Please refer to the most recen t Investigator Brochure  (IB) for more 
detailed information regarding nonclinical experience and previous human experience along with 
the USPIs  and the SmPCs  for bempedoic acid and bempedoic acid/ezetimibe FCDP.  
4.3 Dose Selection  
A dose of bempedoic acid 180  mg once per day was selected based on approved doses by the US 
FDA (Nexletol ) and the European Medicines Agency ( Nilemdo ).  The dose for bempedoic 
acid/ezetimibe FCDP (bempedo ic acid 180  mg/ezetimibe 10  mg) was selected based on 
approved doses by the US FDA ( Nexlizet)  and the European Medicines Agency ( Nustendi ).  For 
additional information please refer to the most recent IB, the USPIs for  Nexletol  and Nexlizet  
and the SmPCs for Nilemdo  and Nustendi . 
Subjects enrolled in the study will be dose d for 6 consecutive days in order to reach steady -state 
concentrations of bempedoic acid  or bempedoic acid and ezetimibe  in plasma.  Steady -state 
concentrations in plasma are expected after 5 to 7 days of repeat dosing as estimates of 
elimination half -life of bempedoic acid  and ezetimibe  are each approximately 24 hours.  A once 
daily dosing regimen for 6 days will achieve plasma concentrations that are approximately 98% 
of steady -state levels.  Six days of repeat dosing have been  selected to ensure subjects  are at 
steady -state plasma concentrations of bempedoic acid  or bempedoic acid and ezetimibe  for 
pharmacokinetic (PK) assessments.   
4.4 Risk Benefit Summary  
Subjects in this clinical study are healthy lactating volunteers who choose to stop breastfeeding 
their infant for the duration of the Treatment and Washout Period s (13 days) and will not receive 
any health benefit from participating in this study.  Both bempedoic acid and bempedoic 
acid/ezetimibe  FCDP are approved by the FDA and EMA.

6.1 Overall Study Design  
This is a Phase 4, open -label study that will estimate the daily infant dosage  and RID for 
bempedoic acid and bempedoic  acid/ezetimibe FCDP and characterize the excretion of 
bempedoic acid, ezetimibe, and metabolites ESP 15228 , bempedoic acid glucuronide , and 
ezetimibe -glucuronide in the mature breast  milk of healthy women.  The study will enroll 
16 healthy lactating subjects, who will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either bempedoic 
acid (Cohort 1) or bempedoic acid/ezetimibe FCDP  (Cohort 2) , who choose to stop breastfeeding 
their infant for t he duration of the Treatment and Washout period s (13 days).  After signing the 
informed consent form ( ICF), subjects will enter the Screening Period  for up to 42  days, 
followed by a 6 -day Treatment Period and a 7 -day Washout Period.  At Visit T1, subjects will be 
administered IMP at the  clinical research unit CRU.  The IMP  will then be self -administered at 
home on Day 2 through Day 5.  Study staff will phone subjects Day  2 through Day 5 to ensure 
IMP is being taken appropriatel y and remind subjects to discard breast milk produced after the 
first dose of IMP.  Subjects will check -in to the CRU on the evening of Day 5 (with Sponsor 
approval the subject may check -in to the CRU on the morning of Day 6) for Visit T2  and start a 
24-hour breast milk collection after the last dose of IMP on the morning of Day 6.  Serum PK 
samples will be obtained on Day 7, approximately 24  hours after IMP administration on Day 6.  
Subjects will be discharged from the CRU on the morning of Day 7 approxima tely 24 hours after 
Day 6 dosing and the completion of all Day 7 assessments.  At the end of the Washout Period on 
Day 13, all subjects will be contacted by phone for a Post-treatment Follow -up Visit (Visit FU1).  
Once the call is complete, subjects may re sume feeding their infants breast milk that is currently 
being produced. On Day 43 ( Visit FU2), s tudy staff will contact subjects by phone to assess for 
SAEs and if the patient was able to resume breastfeeding (if intended).  
 Please refer to Appendix  1 for a detailed Schedule of Assessments.

breastfed infant.  
6.3 Estimated Study Duration  
Each subject will be in the study for up t o 55 days.  The 55 days are inclusive of an up to 42  days 
Screening Period followed by a 6 -day Treatment Period and a 7 -day Washout Period.  
6.4 Number of Centers  
Up to 2  clinical research units (CRU)  will participate in this study in the US.  Additional sites 
may be invited to participate to ensure study timelines are met.  
6.5 Number of Subjects  
The study will enroll approximately 16 healthy lactating women randomized in a 1:1 ratio of 
bempedoic acid (Cohort 1) to bempedoic acid/ezetimibe FCDP  (Cohort 2) .  
6.6 Subject Number and Identification  
A unique subject identification number will be assigned to each subject to identify each subject 
throughout the study. Subject identification numbers will be assigned sequentially by the study 
site at the time of informed consent at the Screening  Visit  (Visit S1) .  
6.7 Subject Withdrawal and Replacement  
A subject is free to withdraw from the study at any time.   Approximately 16 (8  bempedoic acid 
[Cohort 1] and 8 bempedoic acid/ezetimibe FCDP [Cohort 2]) healthy lactating female subjects 
will be enrolled.  If a subject discontinues the study early or does not receive 6 daily doses of 
IMP or does not complete the 24 -hour breast milk collection after Day 6 dosing, a replacement 
subject will be enrolled and assigned to the same treatment.   The site must notify the Sponsor of 
any early withdrawals.  
6.8 End of Study  
A subject is considered to have completed the study if all phases of the study are completed 
including the Follow -up Visit (FU1) on Day  13.  
The end of the study is defined as the date of the Follow -up Visit (FU1) on Day 13 for the last 
active subject in the study.  
Study staff will contact subjects by phone 30 days (Day 43 , FU2 ) after F U1 to assess for serious 
adverse events ( SAEs ) and if  the patient was able to resume breastfeeding (if intended) .

8.1 Administration of Investigational Medicinal Product  
On Day 1 (Visit T1) of the Treatment Period, subjects will be randomized to receive bempedoic 
acid (Cohort 1 ) or bempedoic acid/ezetimibe FCDP  (Cohort 2 ).  Each dose of IMP is comprised 
of 1 tablet from a bottle .  The CRU staff will administer IMP to subjects in the unit on Day  1 and 
Day 6  of the study.  The IMP  will be self -administered by subjects on Day 2 through Day  5 at 
home.  Subjects will  be instructed to take IMP once daily at approximately the same time each 
morning ( ± 2 hours) with or without food.  On the evening of Day 5  (Visit T2) , subjects will 
check -in to the CRU and CRU staff will administer IMP on the morning of Day  6. 
Study staf f will call subjects on Days 2 through Day 5 to ensure they are taking IMP 
appropriately.   Day and time of IMP administration must be captured in the Study Drug Diary.   
If the subject forgets to take IMP at the same time ( ± 2 hours) Day 2 through Day 5, it  may be 
taken up to 6 hours later the same day.   After that, the subject should not take IMP that day and 
the Sponsor should be contacted to determine if the subject should continue or be replaced in the 
study.  The details describing the reason for the missed dose should be documented in the 
subject’s medical record.  Extra IMP is provided and can be used to replace a dose of IMP that 
cannot be used if lost or damaged.

12.1.1  Demographic  Data and Medical History  
Demographic data and a complete medical history will be obtained from the subject.  For 
medical history, conditions and surgeries that are relevant and/or clinically significant should be 
captured with at least a start date (month a nd year) and whether the condition is ongoing or 
resolved.  In addition, a postpartum history from the recent pregnancy , inclusive of gestational 
age at delivery, date of delivery, stage of lactation, length of time postpartum, extent of use of 
infant form ula, and smoking and alcohol intake will be obtained.  
12.1.2  Estimated Glom erular Filtration Rate  
Estimated glomerular  filtration rate (eGFR) is evaluated during  screening using the MDRD 
Study equation  (Levey, 2006 ).  Subjects with an eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m2 will not be eligible 
to participate in the study.  
eGFR (mL/min/1.73 m²) = 175 × (serum creatinine)-1.1.54 × (Age)-0.203 × 0.742 (if female) × 1.212 
(if African American ). 
12.1.3  Child -Pugh Classification for Assessment of Liver Disease  
Child -Pugh classification is evaluated during screening.  Please refer to  Appendix 2 .  Subjects 
classified as Child -Pugh Class B or Class  C are not eligible to participate in the study.  
12.1.4  Vital Signs  
Vital signs will include diastolic blood pre ssure ( DBP ) and systolic blood pressure ( SBP) as well 
as heart rate.  
Vital  signs will be collected prior to blood collection.  Blood pressure and heart rate will be 
measured using a calibrated, fully automated machine with a cuff that is appropriate to the  size 
of the subject’s upper arm.  If a fully automated machine is not available, BP may be measured 
manually.  The same method (either automated or manual) and the same arm (right or left) must 
be used throughout the study.  The subject should be in a sea ted position with feet touching the

Clinical safety laboratory samples will be collected by appropriate clinical site personnel  and 
analyzed at the central laboratory according to site specific procedures.  
12.1.7.3  General Monitoring and Management of Abnormal Clinical Lab oratory  
Assessments  
It is the Investigator’s responsibility to review the results of all laboratory tests as they become 
available and to sign and date the review.  For each laboratory test result outside of the 
laboratory normal reference range, the Investigator needs to ascertain if this is a clinically 
significant change from baseline for the individual subject, with baseline defined as the last value 
or observation before the first dose of IMP.  The Investigator may repeat the laboratory test or 
request additional tests to verify the results of the original laborat ory test.  
If a laboratory value is determined to be abnormal and is a clinically significant change from 
baseline for the subject, the Investigator should determine if it qualifies as an  
AE (Section  13.2.3), and if yes, an appropriate eCRF will be completed.  All clinically 
significant laboratory abnormalities occurring during the study that were not present at baseline 
should be followed and evaluated with additional tests if necessary, until diagnosis of the 
underlying cause or resolution.   
12.1.7.4  Total Blood Volume of Clinical Laboratory Samples  
The total number of venipunctures and total volume of whole blood collected during the study 
will be limited to that needed for safety and PK.  Total whole blood volume  collected over the 
study duration is not to exceed approximately 65 mL for each subject.

13.1 Adverse Events  
13.1.1  Definition of an Adverse Event  
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation subject 
administered a pharmaceutical product, including control, which does not necessarily have a 
causal relationship with treatment.  The Investigator is responsible for ens uring that any AEs 
observed by the Investigator or reported by the subject are recorded in the subject’s medical 
record.  
An AE can be:  
• any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), 
symptom, or disease temporally associated  with the use of a medicinal product, 
whether or not considered related to the medicinal product , 
• any new disease or exacerbation of an existing disease , or 
• any deterioration in nonprotocol -required measurements of laboratory value or other 
clinical test ( e.g., ECG or x -ray) that results in symptoms, a change in treatment, or 
discontinuation from IMP . 
13.1.2  Reporting for Adverse Events  
All AEs occurring during the course of the study (starting from signing informed consent to the 
end of study) will be collected o n the AE eCRF.  Subjects should be instructed to report any AE 
that they experience to the Investigator.  Investigators should make an assessment for AEs at 
each visit and record the event on the appropriate AE eCRF.  
Wherever possible, a specific disease or syndrome rather than individual associated signs and 
symptoms should be identified by the Investigator and recorded on the eCRF ; however, if an 
observed or reported sign or symptom is not considered a component of a  specific disease or 
syndrome by the Investigator, it should be recorded as a separate AE on the eCRF.  Additionally, 
the condition that led to a medical or surgical procedure ( e.g., surgery, endoscopy, tooth 
extraction, transfusion) should be recorded as an AE, not the procedure.  
Any medical condition already present at screening or baseline should not be reported as an AE 
unless the medical condition or signs or symptoms present at baseline changes in severity or 
seriousness at any time during the study.  In this case, it should be reported as an AE.  
Clinically significant abnormal laboratory or other examination ( e.g., ECG) findings that are 
detected during the study or are present at baseline and significantly worsen during the study 
should be reported a s AEs.  The Investigator will exercise their medical and scientific judgment 
in deciding whether an abnormal laboratory finding,  or other abnormal assessment is clinically 
significant.  Significant abnormal laboratory values occurring during the clinical s tudy will be 
followed until repeat tests return to normal, stabilize, or are no longer clinically significant.  Any 
abnormal test that is determined to be an error does not require reporting as an AE.  
Analys es of certain AEs will be performed in this study  for reasons either associated with other 
lipid-lowering therapies or where deemed important based on nonclinical or clinical data.  These

Confidential   Page 43 of 67 events include the following:  hepatic events , musculoskeletal events , diabetes and glycemia, 
hypoglycemia associated  with metabolic acidosis, renal impairment, neurocognitive events, atrial 
fibrillation, and tendon rupture/ tendinopathy.  
Each AE is to be evaluated for duration, severity, seriousness, and causal relationship to the IMP.  
For each AE, the following information will be recorded:  
• description of the event ( e.g., headache) ; 
• date of onset ; 
• date of resolution (or that the event is continuing) ; 
• action taken as a result of the event ; 
• seriousness of the event ; 
• severity of the event ; 
• outcome of the event ; and  
• Investigator’s assessment of relationship to IMP.  
A cluster of signs and symptoms that results from a single cause should be reported as a single 
AE ( e.g., fever, elevated white blood cells [WBC], cough, abnormal chest x -ray, et c., can all be 
reported as “pneumonia”).  
The Investigator will carefully evaluate the comments of the subject and the response to 
treatment in order that they may judge the true nature and severity of the AE.  The question of 
the relationship of AEs to IMP  administration should be determined by the Investigator or study 
physician after thorough consideration of all facts that are available.  
13.1.3  Severity  
It is the Investigator’s responsibility to assess the intensity (severity) of an AE.  
The severity of the AE w ill be characterized as mild, moderate, or severe according to the 
following definitions:  
• Mild:  Events are usually transient and do not interfere with the subject’s daily 
activities . 
• Moderate:  Events introduce a low level of inconvenience or concern to the subject 
and may interfere with daily activities . 
• Severe:  Events interrupt the subject’s usual daily activity, are incapacitating with 
inability to do usual activities, or significantly affect clinical status and warrant 
intervention and/or close follo w-up. 
Note:  a severe AE need not be serious and an SAE need not, by definition, be severe.

Confidential   Page 44 of 67 13.1.4  Relationship  
It is the Investigator’s responsibility to assess the relationship between the IMP and the AE.  The 
degree of “relatedness” of the AE to the IMP may be described using the following scale:  
• Not Related:  No temporal association ; other etiologies are likely the cause . 
• Unlikely:  While cannot be definitively ruled as not related to IMP, a causal 
association is remote, and other etiologies are more likely to be the cause.  For 
reporting and summarization, events assessed as Unlikely to be related to IMP will be 
considered as Not Related to IMP.  
• Possible:  Temporal association, but other etiologies are likely the cause ; however, 
involvement of the IMP cannot  be excluded.  
• Probable:  Temporal association, other etiologies are possible but unlikely.  The event 
may respond if the IMP is discontinued.  
• Definite:  Established temporal association with administration of the IMP with no 
other more probable cause.  Typically, the event should resolve when the IMP is 
discontinued and recur on re -challenge.  
13.1.5  Monitoring and Follow -up of Adverse Events  
Subjects having AEs will be monitored with relevant clinical assessments and laboratory tests, as 
determined by the Investig ator.  All follow -up results are to be reported to the Sponsor personnel 
or the authorized Medical Monitor.  Any actions taken and follow -up results must be recorded 
either on the appropriate page of the eCRF or in appropriate follow -up written corresponde nce, 
as well as in the subject’s source documentation.  Follow -up laboratory results should be filed 
with the subject’s source documentation.  
For all AEs that require the subject to be discontinued from the study, relevant clinical 
assessments and laborato ry tests must be repeated at appropriate intervals until final resolution or 
stabilization of the event(s).  
Subjects with AEs related to IMP that are ongoing at study discontinuation or completion must 
be followed until resolution or for 30  days after stud y completion, whichever comes first, with 
the exception of subjects reporting SAEs  (Section  13.2.4). 
13.2 Serious Adverse Events  
13.2.1  Definition of Serious Adverse Event  
An SAE is defined as any AE occurring at any dose that results in any of the following 
outcomes : 
• results in death ; 
• is life -threatening ; 
• requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization ; 
• results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or substantial disruption of the 
ability to conduct normal life functions ;

Confidential   Page 45 of 67 • is a congenital anomaly/birth defect ; or 
• an important medical event . 
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life threatening, or require 
hospitalization may be considered an SAE when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they 
may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the 
outcomes listed in this definition.  Examples of such medical events include allergic 
bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room, blood dyscrasias, 
convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalization, or t he development of drug 
dependency or drug abuse.  
13.2.2  Events or Outcomes Not Qualifying as Serious Adverse Events  
The following are not considered SAEs and therefore do not need to be reported as such:  
• preplanned or elective hospitalization including social a nd/or convenience situations 
(e.g., due to inclement weather) , or 
• overdose of either Esperion IMP or concomitant medication unless the event meets 
SAE criteria ( e.g., hospitalization) ; however, the event should still be captured as a 
nonserious AE on the a ppropriate eCRF page.  
13.2.3  Clinical Laboratory Assessments as Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
It is the responsibility of the Investigator to assess the clinical significance of all abnormal values 
as defined by the list of reference ranges from the corresponding laboratory.  In some cases, 
significant changes in lab oratory  values within the normal range will require similar judgment.  
An abnormal laboratory value that is not already associated with an AE is to be recorded as an 
AE only if any one of t he following criteria is met:  
• an action on the IMP is made as a result of the abnormality ; 
• intervention for management of the abnormality is required ; or 
• at the discretion of the Investigator should the abnormality be deemed clinically 
significant . 
13.2.4  Reporti ng Serious Adverse Events  
All SAEs occurring from the time of informed consent of a subject until 30  days following 
completion or discontinuation of study must be reported by the Principal Investigator or designee 
to the Safety Contact within 24  hours of t he Principal Investigator or the clinical site becoming 
aware of the occurrence.  All SAEs that the Investigator considers related to IMP that occur after 
the 30 -day follow -up period of the study must be reported to the Sponsor.  
To report an SAE, complete the electronically  provided SAE form  in the EDC system  and submit  
it to  the Safety  Contact .  Paper SAE form should only be used in case of EDC system outage. 
Principal Investigator or designee should c omplete the SAE form on paper and  fax it to  the

requirements.  All investigators involved in studies usi ng the same IMP will receive any safety 
alert notifications for onward submission to their local IRB as required.  
All SAEs should be recorded on the eCRF and source documents.  Criteria for documenting the 
relationship to IMP and severity will be the same as those previously described.  
The Investigator must continue to follow the subject until the SAE has subsided or until the 
condition becomes chronic in nature, stabilizes (in the case of persistent impairment), or the 
subject dies.  
Within 24  hours of rece ipt of follow -up information, the Investigator must update the SAE form 
and submit any supporting documentation ( e.g., patient discharge summary or autopsy reports) to 
designated Safety Contact.  
The Sponsor (and/or legally transferred designee) will repor t SAEs and suspected and 
unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSARs) as required by regulatory authorities, IRBs, and 
investigators/institutions in compliance with all reporting requirements according to local 
regulations, laws, and GCPs.  The Investigat or should notify the appropriate IRB of SAEs 
occurring at the site and other AE reports received from the Sponsor, in accordance with local 
procedures and statutes.

14.1 General Considerations  
The statistical analysis described in this section will be performed as further outlined in a 
separate Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).  The SAP will supersede the protocol in the event of 
any difference between the 2 documents in data analysis and the pro tocol will be amended of 
appropriate.  Statistical analyses in this study will be descriptive in nature.  No statistical 
inference is planned.  Subject disposition, demographics , and baseline characteristics will be 
summarized.  Summary statistics for cont inuous variables will include the number of subjects, 
mean, median, standard deviation or standard error, first and third quartiles , minimum, and 
maximum.  Summary statistics for PK parameters will also include geometric mean and 
coefficient of Variation ( CV) (%).  For categorical variables, the frequency and percentage will 
be given.  
14.2 Determination of Sample Size  
A minimum sample size of 16 (8 subjects who receive  bempedoic acid [Cohort 1] and 8 subjects 
who receive bempedoic acid/ezetimibe FCDP  [Cohort 2] ) evaluable subjects (who complete the 
6-day treatment period and the 24 -hour breast milk collection in the CRU) is planned for this 
study.  Subjects who are randomized but do not complete the 24 -hour breast milk collection in 
the CRU will be replaced with a  new subject on the same treatment to ensure 8 evaluable 
subjects in each cohort for the final analyses.  
The sample size was not  based on empirical or hypothesis testing criteria.  The sample size was 
based on clinical and regulatory considerations and pre cedence in previous ETC -1002 studies 
( ).  The sample size is considered sufficient to address the primary objective s of 
the study.  
14.3 Analysis Population  
14.3.1  Safety Population  
The Safety Population (SP), used for all the safety summaries, is define d as all subjects who  
received at least 1 dose of IMP. 
14.3.2  Pharmacokinetic Population  
The PK Population will include all subjects who complete the 24 -hour breast milk collection 
after IMP administration on Day  6. 
14.3.2.1  Primary Analyses  
• Daily infant dosage and RID of bempedoic acid  will be summarized for Cohort  1 
subjects who receive once daily bempedoic acid  for 6 consecutive days.  
• Daily infant dosage and RID of bempedoic acid and ezetimibe will be summarized 
for Cohort 2 subjects who received once daily bempedoic acid/ezetimibe FCDP for 
6 consecutive days.  
• RID will be calculated as the ratio of total infant dose per kg body weight a nd 
maternal dose per kg body weight , multiplied by 100 .

15.1 Study Monitoring  
The Sponsor (or its authorized representative) has the obligation to follow this study closely to 
ensure that the study is conducted in accordance with the protocol, International Conference on 
Harmonisation (ICH) a nd GCP guidelines, national and international regulatory requirements, 
and the current Declaration of Helsinki throughout its duration by means of personal visits to the 
Investigator’s facilities and other communications.  
These visits will be conducted to evaluate the progress of the study, verify the rights and 
well-being of the subjects are protected, and verify the reported clinical study data are accurate, 
complete, and verifiable from source documents.  This includes review of ICFs, results of tests 
performed as a requirement for participation in this study, and any other medical records 
(e.g., laboratory reports, clinic notes, IMP dispensing log, pharmacy records, subject -completed 
diaries, or telephone logs) required to confirm information contained i n the eCRFs.  
The monitoring strategy for the study foresees a risk -based monitoring approach, in line with the 
relevant FDA recommendations and will be described in detail by the study specific risk -based  
monitoring plan.  
A monitoring visit should include a review of the essential clinical study documents (regulatory 
documents, case report forms, medical records and source documents, drug disposition records, 
and subject ICFs, etc.) as well as discussion on the conduct of the study with the Investigator and  
staff.  
The monitor should conduct these visits as frequently as appropriate for the clinical study.  The 
Investigator and staff should be available during these visits for discussion of the conduct of the 
study as well as to facilitate the review of the clinical study records and resolve/document any 
discrepancies found during the visit.  
All monitoring activities will be reported and archived.  In addition, monitoring visits will be 
documented at the clinical site by signature and date on the study -specif ic monitoring log.  
15.2 Audits and Inspections  
Representatives of the Sponsor or its authorized clinical quality assurance group may visit a 
clinical site at any time during the study to conduct an audit of the study in compliance with 
regulatory guidelines and  company policy.  These audits will require access to all study records, 
including source documents, for inspection and comparison with the eCRFs.  Subject privacy 
must be respected.  The Investigator and clinical site personnel are responsible for being p resent

18.1 Inspection of Records  
Applicable regulations require  the Sponsor (or designee) to inspect all documents and records to 
be maintained by the Investigator, including but not limited to, medical records (office, clinic, or 
hospital) for the subjects in this study.  These regulations also allow the Sponsor’s re cords to be 
inspected by authorized representatives of the regulatory agencies.  The Investigator will permit 
study -related monitoring, audits, IRB review, and regulatory inspections by providing direct 
access to source data/documents.  Direct access inclu des permission to examine, analyze, verify, 
and reproduce any records and reports that are important to the evaluation of a clinical study.  
18.2 Retention of Records  
In compliance with the ICH/GCP guidelines, the Investigator/Institution agrees to retain and 
maintain all study records that support the data collected from each subject, as well as all study 
documents as specified in ICH/GCP, Section  8 Essential Documents for the Conduct of a 
Clinical Trial.  The Investigator agrees to contact the Sponsor before de stroying or relocating any 
study documentation and is expected to take measures to prevent accidental or premature 
destruction of these documents.  
If the Investigator retires, relocates, or for other reasons withdraws from the responsibility of 
keeping the study records, custody must be transferred to a person who will accept responsibility.  
The Sponsor must be contacted in writing regarding the name and ad dress of the new person 
responsible as well as the disposition of document storage.  Under no circumstances shall the 
Investigator relocate or dispose of any study documents before having obtained written approval 
from the Sponsor.  
Essential records (inclu ding eCRFs, source documents, IMP disposition records, signed subject 
ICFs, AE reports, and other regulatory documents) as required by the applicable regulations, 
must be maintained for 2  years after a marketing application is approved for the drug for the  
indication for which it is being investigated; or, if no application is to be filed or if the 
application is not approved for such indication, until 2  years after formal discontinuation of 
clinical development of the investigational product.  
It is the res ponsibility of the Sponsor to inform the Investigator/Institution as to when these 
documents no longer need to be retained.  
18.3 Case Report Forms and Study Records  
Access to eCRFs will be provided to the clinical site.  As part of the responsibilities assumed by 
participating in the study, the Investigator agrees to maintain adequate case histories for the 
subjects treated as part of the research under this protocol.  The Investigator agrees to maintain 
accurate source documentation and eCRFs as part of the cas e histories.  
Study records are comprised of source documents, eCRFs, and all other administrative 
documents ( e.g., IRB correspondence, clinical study materials , and supplies shipment manifests, 
monitoring logs, and correspondence).  A study -specific binder  will be provided with 
instructions for the maintenance of study records.

contains medical information or test results that have been collected for or in support of the  
protocol specifications ( e.g., laboratory reports, clinic notes, IMP disposition log, pharmacy 
records, subject sign -in sheets, and telephone logs).  All draft, preliminary, and pre -final 
iterations of a final report are also considered to be source docum ents ( e.g., faxed and hard copy 
of laboratory reports, faxed and hard copy of initial results, and final report).  
The Investigator agrees to allow direct access to all essential clinical study documents for the 
purpose of monitoring and/or auditing by the  Sponsor or its authorized representatives and 
inspection by the appropriate regulatory authorities.  
Data reflecting the subject’s participation with the IMP under investigation are to be reported to 
the Sponsor.  The data are to be recorded on the eCRFs a nd/or other media provided or approved 
by the Sponsor.  
A completed eCRF must be submitted for each subject who receives IMP, regardless of duration.  
All supportive documentation submitted with the eCRF, such as laboratory or hospital records, 
should be cl early identified with the study and subject number.  Any personal information, 
including subject name, should be removed or rendered illegible to preserve individual 
confidentiality.  The eCRF should not be used as a source document unless otherwise specif ied 
by the Sponsor.  
Neither the Sponsor nor a service provider contracted to analyze data and complete the study 
report is permitted to interpret a blank answer; therefore, all fields should be completed.  All 
requested information must be entered on the e CRFs.  If an item is not available or is not 
applicable, this fact should be indicated as not available (N/A) or not done (N/D); do not leave a 
field blank.  
Each set of completed eCRFs must be signed and dated by the Investigator acknowledging 
review and t hat the data are accurate and complete.  The completed database is to be returned to 
the Sponsor as soon as practical after completion by the mechanism prescribed for the protocol.  
It is essential that all dates appearing on the Sponsor’s subject data coll ection forms for 
laboratory tests, cultures, etc., be the dates on which the specimens were obtained,  or the 
procedures performed.  The eCRFs will be electronically signed by the Investigator and dated as 
verification of the accuracy of the recorded data.  All data collection forms should be completed 
in a timely manner as defined in the eCRF Completion Guidelines.

Niraparib    
Clinical Study Protocol 3000 -01-004 Version 6.0   
Confidential   Page 10 of 103 compared to 3 niraparib capsules (3×1 00 mg). In addition, t his study will evaluate the effect of a 
high-fat meal on the PK of the niraparib 300 mg tablet formulation . The Extension Phase will enable 
patients enrolled in the study to continue to receive treatment with niraparib if they are tolerating it 
and, in the Investigator’s opinion, may receive benefit.  
Methodology:  
Overall Study Design  
This is a multicenter, open -label study in patients with advanced solid tumors. This is a 3 -stage, single 
cohort, randomized -sequence, single-crossover study to assess the relative BA and BE of niraparib 
tablet formulation relative to the capsule formulation . In addition, Stage 3 of the protocol is a single 
cohort, randomized -sequence, 2 -period, single dose, crossover study to assess effe ct of food on the PK 
of the niraparib tablet formulation.  
Pharmacokinetics (PK) Phase:  In Stages 1 and 2 , patients will be randomized 1:1 to receive tablet 
formulation followed by capsule formulation or capsule formulation followed by tablet formulation . In 
Stage 3, patients will be randomized 1:1 to receive tablet formulation in a fasted state followed by 
tablet formulation taken with a high -fat meal or tablet formulation  taken with a high -fat meal followed 
by tablet formulation taken in a fasted state.  
Stage 1:  Following an 8 -hour fast on Day  1 (see Section 6.1.1), patients will receive a single dose of 
the formulation (tablet [1×300  mg] or capsul e [3×100 mg]) followed by a 7 -day (+1 day) Washout/PK 
period followed by a dose of the alternate formulation also in a fasted state, followed by a 7 -day 
Washout/PK period. Patients receiving the tablet in the first treatment period will receive the capsule s 
in the second treatment period and vice versa ( see Section  6.1.1). Extensive PK sampling will be 
carried out after niraparib dosing (see Section 10.1).  
Stage 2:  Following an 8 -hour fast on Day  1 (see Section 6.1.1), patients will receive a single dose of 
the formulation (tablet [1×300  mg] or capsule [3×100  mg]) followed by a 14 -day (+/- 4 days) 
Washout/PK period, followed by a dose of the alternate for mulation also in a fasted state, followed by 
a 7-day Washout/PK period. Patients receiving the tablet in the first treatment period will receive the 
capsules in the second treatment period and vice versa ( see Section  6.1.1). Extensive PK sampling will 
be carried out after niraparib dosing (see Section 10.1 ).  
Stage 3: In period 1, patients will receive a single 300 mg niraparib tablet either following a 10 -hour 
fast (see Section 6.1.1) or directly following consumption of a high -fat meal (see Section 6.1.1), 
followed by a 14-day (+4 days) PK sampling and washout period. In period 2, patients will be crossed 
over to receive a single 300 mg niraparib tablet in a fasted state or with a high -fat meal, followed by a 
7-day PK sampling period. All patients will fast for a min imum of 4 hours postdose in both periods. 
Patients receiving the tablet in a fasted state in the first treatment period will receive the tablet with a 
high-fat meal in the second treatment period and vice versa.  
In the rare instance where a delay of the e ntire PK period 2 is needed for any reason beyond the 4-day 
window specified above , the site must contact the Sponsor's Medical Monitor to discuss the patient 
circumstances. The Sponsor will then decide if the patient can continue with PK period 2 with a delay.  
Similarly, should the laboratory results on D15 (the day of niraparib admin istration in PK Period 2) 
show changes in organ function such that the original inclusion criteria for laboratory values are no 
longer met, or in the event of a significant change of patient’s clinical status as judged by the 
Investigator, the site must co nsult with the Sponsor to discuss the patient's continued participation in 
PK period 2. Note that sites need not wait for the pre -dose laboratory results to begin PK period 2, but

Clinical Study Protocol 3000 -01-004 Version 6.0   
Confidential   Page 12 of 103 if no treatment interruption or discontinuation was required during the first 2 cycles of Extension Phase 
therapy and after approval from the Sponsor.  
Patients have up to 28 days (21 days for  Stage 3 only; up to 28 days may be acceptable following 
discussion between the Sponsor and Investigator ) after completion of the PK Phase to complete the 
screening assessments and the Extension Phase Screening Visit. A tumor assessment is to be 
performed prior to the first dose of the Extension Phase (pre -Extension Phase). The pre -Extension 
Phase tumor assessment need not be completed if the baseline tumor assessm ent was performed 
≤56 days before the first dose of the Extension Phase.  
The Cycle 1/Day 1 Visit can occur on the same day as the Extension Phase Screening Visit, dependent 
upon availability of radiographic results obtained ≤56 days of the first planned do se in the Extension 
Phase. If the Extension Phase Screening Visit and the Cycle 1/Day 1 Visit occur on the same day, the 
clinical laboratory results will be reviewed by the study personnel prior to study drug administration to 
ensure eligibility. At the Cy cle 1/Day 1 Visit, patients will undergo safety assessments and will receive 
study drug supply for the duration of 1 cycle (300  mg or 200 mg tablets of niraparib for QD dosing or 
3×100 mg or 2×100 mg tablets/capsules of niraparib for QD dosing, depending o n availability). It is 
preferred that patients remain on the same formulation (tablet versus capsule) throughout the Extension 
Phase. Patients will return on the first day of every treatment cycle (28±7 days) to receive study drug 
and for safety assessment s. Visits will continue approximately every 4  weeks until treatment 
discontinuation. In line with the niraparib United States Package Insert (US PI), dose interruption (no 
longer than 28  days) will be allowed based on adverse events (AEs). In addition, dos e reductions to 
200 mg QD and subsequently to 100  mg QD will be allowed based on AEs (please refer to US PI). 
Any dose reductions differing from  this must be discussed with the medical monitor. Patients can 
continue in the Extension Phase until the patient  meets 1 of the withdrawal criteria  (Section 7.4). 
End of Treatment (EOT) and Safety Follow -up Visits: The EOT visit will occur within 7 days of 
the decision to discontinue study drug for any reason. Patients who do not participate in the Extension 
Phase will also have an EOT visit within 7 days of the decision to discontinue study. Should the first 
dose of a new anti -cancer therapy occur within 14 day s of the decision to discontinue study drug, all 
assessments required for the Safety Follow -up visit should occur at the EOT visit and this visit will be 
considered the Safety Follow -up visit. If the first dose of the new anti -cancer therapy occurs >14 day s 
of the decision to discontinue study, the Safety Follow -up visit will occur 30+7 days after the last dose 
of the study drug, or at the start of any new anti -cancer therapy, whichever occur first.

Sample Size Consideration  
Stage 1 
No formal sample size calculation was performed for Stage 1. Approximately 24 patients will be 
enrolled in Stage 1. This sample size is considered adequate for preliminary assessment of the relative 
bioavailability of the tablet compared to the cap sules and for estimating the intra -subject coefficient of 
variation, after accounting for patient drop -outs and potential carryover.  
Stage 2 
Based on estimates from Stage 1, 100 BA/BE evaluable patients are required in Stage 2.   With 100 
evaluable patients , assuming the intra -subject coefficient of variation (CV) is 25% and  the true ratio of 
means is 0.89, there is at least 90% power to demonstrate the bioequivalence (bioequivalence range: 
0.800 to 1.250; alpha=0.05).  Power calculations were also performed  under alternative assumptions 
for the CV and mean ratio.   Assuming the CV is 30% and the true ratio of means is 0.89, with 100 
evaluable patients, there is 82% power to demonstrate bioequivalence.  Assuming the true ratio is 0.90, 
the power is 96% and 88% assuming CVs of 25% and 30%, respectively.  
The final analysis of bioequivalence will be based on Stage 2 BA/BE evaluable patients only, with a 
target sample size of 100 evaluable patients . Patients may be identified as non -evaluable due to issues 
arising during the study conduct, such as:  
• emesis within 9 hours of dosing,  
• dosing errors,  
• patient did not fast prior to dosing,  
• missing critical PK sample on Day 8,  
• failure to complete both PK periods, and  
• significant changes to the patient ’s medical status th at would potentially affect the PK profile 
as determined by the Sponsor in consultation with the Investigator prior to PK data analysis.  
In this patient population, approximately 170 total patients are targeted for enrollment, assuming a 35% 
non-evaluability rate during the study conduct, and an additional 10% non -evaluability rate during PK 
analysis. The non-evaluability rate arising during the study conduct will be continuously monitored by 
the Sponsor  and the total number of enrolled patients  may be adjusted accordingly with the aim to 
target the resulting sample size of 100 BA/BE evaluable patients.   
Stage 3 
Assuming the true ratio of means is 1 and the intra -subject CV is 20% for AUC0-t and AUC0-∞, with 16 
evaluable patients, there is approximately 83%  probability the 90% CI of the ratio of geometric means 
will be within 0.800 and 1.250.  Based on the results of a FE study conducted using the capsule 
formulation, an effect of a high -fat meal on C max is possible. The sample size of 16 patients is deemed 
adequate to characterize this effect. AUC0-t and AUC 0-∞ will be the primary parameters for analysis.   
The primary analysis will be based on the FE Evaluable Population as it is the most conservative 
approach, which maximizes the benefits of the crossover de sign, where each patient serves as their 
own control. Results for the PK Evaluable Population will also be summarized and reported for this 
study.

Clinical Study Protocol 3000 -01-004 Version 6.0   
Confidential   Page 25 of 103 Patients may be identified as non -evaluable due to issues arising during the study conduct, such as:  
• dosing errors,  
• patient did not follow dietary requirements prior to dose and postdose,  
• failure to complete both PK periods, and  
• significant changes to the patient ’s medical status that would potentially affect the PK profile 
as determined by the Sponsor in consultation with the Investigator prior to PK data analysis.  
Patients who experience emesis within 10 hours of dosing or miss sufficient samples to render 
calculation of AUC unreliable will be discontinued from the PK phase. To account for non -evaluable 
patients, approximately 20 total patients are targeted for enrollment.  The non-evaluability rate arising 
during the study conduct will be continuously monitored by the Sponsor  and the total number of 
enrolled patients  may be adjusted accordingly with th e aim to target the resulting sample size of 16  
evaluable patients.   
Safety Analyses  
Data from the Stage 1 PK Phase, Stage 2 PK Phase, Stage 3 PK Phase and Extension Phase will be 
summarized separately. Summaries will be performed by formulation, fed/fasted state, and dosing 
period as applicable.  
Demographic characteristics will be summarized descriptively and will include age, sex, race, height, 
and weight.  
Protocol deviations will be listed by patient.  
All analysis for safety endpoints will be performed in a descriptive manner. Continuous variables will 
be summarized using descriptive statistics (number of patients, mean, standard deviation [SD], 
minimum, median, and maximum). Categorical variables will be summarized using counts of patients 
and percentag es. 
All AEs will be listed. The number and percent of patients who experience a TEAE will be 
summarized by timing/treatment for each system organ class and preferred term. AEs will also be 
tabulated accordingly by intensity and causality.  
Serious treatmen t emergent adverse events ( TEAEs) and TEAEs resulting in study discontinuation  will 
be listed separately.  
All AEs will be coded using the current version of the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities. 
Safety will be assessed through adverse event ass essment, physical examination, vital sign 
measurements, clinical laboratory tests, and monitoring of concomitant medications.  
AEs are required to be captured through 30 days after cessation of study drug; serious adverse events 
(SAEs) are required to be ca ptured through 90 days after cessation of study drug (or to a minimum of 
30 days post -treatment if the patient starts alternative anticancer therapy); and any pregnancies that 
occur within 180 days post -treatment are to be captured. Study drug -related SAEs  and adverse events 
of special interest (AESIs)  (Section 11.2.1.4 )  will continue to be monitored until study closeout 
(unless death or loss to follo w-up occurs first). All AEs and SAEs experienced by a patient, regardless 
of the suspected causality, will be monitored until the AE or SAE has resolved, until any abnormal 
laboratory values have returned to baseline or normalized, until there is a satisfa ctory explanation for 
Niraparib    
Clinical Study Protocol 3000 -01-004 Version 6.0   
Confidential   Page 26 of 103 the change(s) observed, until the patient is lost to follow -up or withdraws consent, or until the patient 
has died. 
The AESIs for this study are MDS, AML , and secondary cancer (new malignancies other than 
MDS/AML). AESIs must be repor ted to the Sponsor as soon as the Investigator becomes aware of 
them or within 24 hours.  
Individual data listings of laboratory test results will be presented. Flags will be attached to values 
outside of the laboratory's reference limits along with the Inv estigator's assessment. Clinically 
significant laboratory test abnormalities that were considered AEs by the Investigator will be presented 
in the AE listing.  
In addition, for the Extension Phase, clinical laboratory tests (observed values and changes from  
baseline) will be summarized descriptively in tabular format. Shift tables will be presented for select 
laboratory parameters (chemistry and hematology).  
Individual data listings of vital signs (observed and change from Baseline) will be presented for eac h 
patient. Individual clinically significant vital sign findings that were considered AEs by the 
Investigator will be presented in the AE listing.  
All clinically relevant abnormal physical examination findings will be listed.  
Pharmacokinetic Analysis  
Individual patient PK parameter values will be derived by non -compartmental methods using Phoenix 
WinNonlin, version 5.1 or higher. Actual time will be used for parameter calculation. The analysis of 
Stage 1, Stage 2, and Stage 3 will be conducted separate ly.  
During the pharmacokinetic analysis, the following rules will apply:  
• Predose sample >5% of C max: profile will be excluded from PK concentration and PK parameters 
summary and inferential statistics  
• Rsq,adj <0.800: AUC 0-∞, λz, CL/F, Vz/F, and t 1/2 will be excluded from descriptive and  
inferential statistics  
• AUC0-t /AUC 0-∞, <0.800: AUC 0-∞ and parameters  derived from it will be excluded from 
descriptive and inferential statistics  
Planned sampling times will be used to generate the mean concentratio n-time profiles. Individual and 
mean plasma concentrations over time will be plotted by formulation  in Stage 1 and 2 and by 
fed/fasted state in Stage 3 . Plasma concentrations and PK parameters will be summarized in terms of 
the number of patients, arithmet ic mean, median, SD, coefficient of variation (CV), geometric mean, 
geometric CV, minimum and maximum by formulation in Stage 1 and 2 and by fed/fasted state in 
Stage 3, as appropriate. In Stage 3, differences in t max between the fed and fasted state will be assessed 
and summarized based on the FE Evaluable Population. Details will be provided in the 
Pharmacokinetic Analysis Plan.  
The pharmacokinetic profiles and parameters will be summarized across the PK, PK Evaluable, 
BA/BE Evaluable, and FE Evaluable populations, as appropriate. Details will be provided in the 
Pharmacokinetic Analysis Plan.

Confidential   Page 27 of 103 To assess relative bioavailability/bioequivalence, an analysis of variance model (ANOVA) will be used 
on logarithmically transformed AUC 0-t, AUC0-∞, and Cmax accounting for the following sources of 
variation: sequence, subjects nested in sequences, period and treatment. The point estimate and 90% CI 
for the ratios of the geometric means of the test treatment (tablet) compared to the reference treatment 
(capsule) will be obtained. Bioequivalence will be claimed if the 90% CI for the ratio of geometric 
means is between 0.800 and 1.250 for AUC 0-∞, AUC0-t and Cmax. To assess the effect of food in Stage 
3, the ratio of geometric means for  AUC0-t, AUC0-∞, and C max of the test treatment (high -fat meal) 
compared to the reference treatment (fasted state) and corresponding 90% CI will be obtained for 
AUC0-t,, AUC0-∞, and C max. 
A population PK analysis may be performed on the PK data from the PK Phase of the study and will be 
reported separately from the study.

4.1. Background  
Niraparib  is an orally available, potent, highly selective poly (adenosine diphosphate 
[ADP])-ribose polymerase (PARP) -1 and -2 inhibitor. Niraparib cocrystallized with the human 
PARP-1 catalytic domain and was shown to inhibit PARP -1 and PARP -2 activity in vitro with a 
median inhibitory concentration (IC 50) of 3.8 and 2.1  nM, respectively.  
Niraparib was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in March 2017 and is indicated 
for the maintenance treatment of adult patients with re current epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, 
or primary peritoneal cancer who are in a complete or partial response to platinum -based 
chemotherapy.  
4.1.1. Niraparib Nonclinical Studies  
The niraparib nonclinical studies are described in detail in the Investigator’s  Brochure (IB).  
4.1.2. Niraparib Clinical Studies  
In 2008, a Phase 1 study was initiated in an all solid tumors population to investigate the safety 
and tolerability of niraparib. Eight (40% [95% CI 19 -64]) of 20 BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation 
carriers with ovarian canc er had Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors  (RECIST) partial 
responses, as did two (50% [7 -93]) of four mutation carriers with breast cancer. Antitumor 
activity was also reported in sporadic high -grade serous ovarian cancer, non -small-cell lung 
cancer, and prostate cancer  (Sandhu, 2013).   
Clinical studies have shown that PARP inhibitors are active in recurrent ovarian cancer, breast 
cancer, and prostate cancer (Sandhu, 2013; Fong, 2009; Audeh, 2010; Gelmon, 2011; Kummar, 
2012; Ledermann , 2012; Ledermann, 2014). PARP inhibition appears to be most active in 
patients with g BRCA mutations  and in patients who are sensitive to platinum -containing therapy. 
However, clinical benefit has also been observed in g BRCA wild-type patients  (Sandhu, 2013; 
Gelmon, 2011; Kummar, 2012; Ledermann , 2012; Ledermann , 2014).  In the registrational 
ENGOT-OV16/NOVA trial, maintenance treatment of patients with recurrent high-grade serous 
ovarian cancer showed that the PARP -1/2 inhibitor niraparib significantly improved 
progression -free survival (PFS) in g BRCAmut patients (21  months for niraparib vs. 5.5  months 
for control). Furthermore, in the non-BRCAmut population, significant improvement in PFS was 
also observed (9.3 months for niraparib vs. 3.9 months for placebo, hazard ratio [ HR]=0.45, 
p < 0.0001). (Sandhu, 2013; Mirza, 2016) Niraparib has been recently approved in the US for the 
maintenance treatment of patients with recurrent epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary 
peritoneal cancer  (Guan, 2017). The niraparib clinical studies are described in detail in the IB.  
The safety, tolerability,  and PK of niraparib has been evalu ated in a series of clinical studies 
including single-and multiple-dose PK, absorption, metabolism  and elimination, and a Phase 3  
study (ENGOT-OV16/NOVA) , (Mirza, 2016) comprising the QT/QTc and food effect substudy , 
using the capsule formulation . No clinically significant food effect was observed  with the 
capsule formulation , with no change in niraparib AUC0-t and AUC 0-∞ following a high-fat meal, 
and a 20% reduction in C max when compared to fasted state administration .  
Niraparib    
Clinical Study Protocol 3000 -01-004 Version 6.0   
Confidential   Page 38 of 103 Orally-administered niraparib was absorbed with a median time to reach maximum observed 
plasma concentration (t max) of approximately 2 to 4  hours, highly tissue-distributed, and slowly 
metabolized and eliminated. The oral BA of niraparib with the capsule formulation is high 
(absolute BA of the capsule formulation  of approximately 73%). Details of the clinical 
pharmacology of niraparib are described in the n iraparib label and IB.  
4.1.3. Baseline Platelet Count and Weight as Predictors of Thrombocytopenia  in 
Patients Treated with Niraparib  
An analysis was conducted using the data collected in ENGOT -OV16/NOVA and the initial 
Phase 1 study, PN001. This analysis determi ned that only baseline platelets had an impact on 
platelet nadir; lower baseline platelets (<180,000 /μL) were associated with an increased 
frequency of thrombocytopenia Grade ≥1 (76%) or Grade ≥ 3 (45%) compared to patients with 
higher baseline platelet c ounts. Further, an exploratory analysis of clinical data versus baseline 
body weight from ENGOT -OV16/NOVA was conducted. For this analysis, the weight categories 
were based on quartiles with the lowest quartile (patients with a body weight less than 58 kg at 
baseline) compared to the highest quartile (patients with a body weight greater than or equal to 
77 kg at baseline). While TEAEs occurred in most patients regardless of body weight, Grade ≥3 
TEAEs, SAEs, and TEAEs leading to dose modification or treatme nt discontinuation occurred 
more commonly in the weight <58 kg cohort than in the ≥77 kg cohort. In the cohort of patients 
with a body weight <58 kg, approximately 80% of patients had a dose reduction compared to 
59% of patients with a weight greater than or equal to 77 kg. Treatment discontinuations were 
increased in the subjects with lower body weight (24%) compared to patients in the highest 
quartile (10%).  
The potential relationship between body weight and TEAEs was further explored in an analysis 
to evaluate the correlation of Grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia and baseline body weight. The 
lowest platelet count in the first 30 days was plotted versus baseline b ody weight to determine if 
low body weight identified a subgroup of patients with higher levels of thrombocytopenia during 
Cycle 1. In the first 30 days of treatment, a baseline body weight >77 kg is associated with a 
lower incidence of Grade 3 or 4 thromb ocytopenia (14%) relative to the group with body 
weight<58 kg (43%).  
Finally, a classification tree approach was used to refine the best cut -off points for predicting the 
likelihood of a patient developing Grade ≥3 thrombocytopenia within 30 days after the  first dose 
of niraparib. The results of the model show that the subgroup of patients with a baseline body 
weight <77 kg or baseline platelet count <150,000/μL had a Grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia rate in 
the first 30 days of 35.4% compared to 11.5% in the gro up of patients with a body weight >77 kg 
and a platelet count >150,000/μL. Further, the average daily dose was 258 mg through the first 
two cycles for patients with a body weight >77 kg and platelet count >150,000/μL, and was only 
206 mg for patients with body weight < 77 kg or platelet count <150,000/μL. Thus, the actual 
delivered dose approximated a starting dose of 200 mg despite the intended delivery of a starting 
dose of 300 mg . Therefore , in the present study in the Extension Phase , patients whose baseline 
weight is <77 kg or baseline platelet count is <150,000/μL  will be treated at the 200 mg starting 
dose of niraparib .

Clinical Study Protocol 3000 -01-004 Version 6.0   
Confidential   Page 39 of 103 4.2. Rationale for Study  
The approved niraparib drug product is an immediate release hard gelatin capsule dosage form 
that contains 100  mg of niraparib per capsule. The labelled starting dose for niraparib is 300 mg. 
Facilitating this dose requires the administration of three 100 mg capsules.  
It is the Sponsor ’s intent to introduce a tablet dosage form that provides the 100 mg, 200 mg an d 
300 mg dose in single dose strength tablets to reduce the pill burden on the patients.  
To this end, the Sponsor  has developed a tablet dosage form with the specific intent to provide 
comparable performance to the approved capsule dosage form. The formula tion and 
manufacturing process of the tablet were selected to produce a tablet with comparable in -vitro 
performance to the capsule.  
This study is an open label Phase 1 study to evaluate the relative BA and BE of niraparib 
administered as a tablet formulat ion compared to the reference capsule formulation 
manufactured by the same process as currently marketed in the United States. Specifically, a 300 
mg niraparib tablet will be compared to 3 niraparib capsules (3×100 mg).  
Following the PK analysis from the Stage 1 (relative BA), the tablet and capsule formulation  
were found to have similar bioavailability with the 90% confidence interval (CI) for the least 
squares geometric mean ratios of the tablet/capsule C max, AUC 0-t , and AUC 0-∞ falling entirely 
within 0.800 to 1.250. The inter -subject variability of the tablet formulations ’ PK parameter 
estimates appears to be lower than the capsule formulation.  
Niraparib PK in Stage 2 of this study was found to be consistent with the values reported in 
Stage 1 and othe r studies where niraparib PK was assessed. BE was established between the 
niraparib tablet (1×300  mg) and capsule (3×100  mg) formulations. The 90% CIs of the least 
squares geometric mean ratios  for tablet compared to capsules fell within the limits of 0.800 and 
1.250 for all 3 primary niraparib PK parameters (C max, AUC 0-t, and AUC 0-∞). Intrasubject 
variability was low, ranging from 18.1% to 23.7% for the key PK parameters.  
In addition, t his study will evaluate the effect of a high-fat meal on the PK of the niraparib 300  
mg tablet formulation  (Stage 3). The Extension Phase of this study  will enable patients to 
continue to receive treatment with niraparib if they are tolerating it and, in the Investigator’s 
opinion, may receive clinical benefit.

Clinical Study Protocol 3000 -01-004 Version 6.0   
Confidential   Page 41 of 103 6. INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
6.1. Overall Study Design  
This is a multicenter, open label study in patients with advanced solid tumors. This is a 3-stage, 
randomized -sequence, single -crossover study to assess the relative BA and BE of niraparib tablet 
formulation relative to the capsule formulation. In addition , Stage 3 of the protocol is a single 
cohort, randomized -sequence, 2 period, single dose, crossover study to assess effect of food on 
the PK of the niraparib tablet  formulation . 
Pharmacokinetics (PK) Phase : In Stages 1 and 2  patients will be randomized 1:1 to receive 
tablet formulation followed by capsule formulation or capsule formulation followed by tablet 
formulation. In Stage 3, patients will be randomized 1:1 to receive tablet formulation in a fasted 
state followed by tabl et formulation taken with a high -fat meal, or tablet formulation taken with a 
high-fat meal followed by tablet formulation taken in a fasted state.  
Stage 1: Following an 8 -hour fast on Day  1 (see Section  6.1.1), patients will receive a single dose 
of the formulation (tablet [1 ×300 mg] or capsule [3 ×100 mg]) followed by a 7 -day (+1 day) 
Washout/PK period followed by a dose of the alternate formulation a lso in a fasted state, 
followed by a 7 -day Washout/PK period. Patients receiving the tablet in the first treatment period 
will receive the capsules in the second treatment period and vice versa ( Figure 2). Extensive PK 
sampling will be carried out after niraparib dosing (see Section 10.1).  
Stage 2: Following an 8 -hour fast on Day  1 (see Section  6.1.1), patients will rec eive a single dose 
of the formulation (tablet [1 ×300 mg] or capsule [3 × 100 mg]) followed by a 14 -day (+/- 4 days) 
Washout/PK period followed by a dose of the alternate formulation also in a fasted state, 
followed by a 7 -day Washout/PK period. Patients rec eiving the tablet in the first treatment period 
will receive the capsules in the second treatment period and vice versa ( Figure 2). Extensive PK 
sampling will be carried out after niraparib dosing (see S ection 10.1).  
Stage 3: In period 1, patients will receive a single 300 mg niraparib tablet either following a 
10-hour fast (see Section 6.1.1) or directly foll owing consumption of a high -fat meal (see 
Section 6.1.1), followed by a 14 -day (+4 days) PK sampling and washout period. In period 2, 
patients will b e crossed over to receive a single 300 mg niraparib tablet in a fasted state or with a 
high-fat meal, followed by a 7 -day PK sampling period. All patients will fast for a minimum of 4  
hours postdose in both periods. Patients receiving the tablet in a fasted state in the first treatment 
period will receive the tablet with a high -fat meal in the second treatment period and vice versa .  
In the rare instance where a delay of the entire PK period 2 is needed for any reason beyond the 
4-day window specified above the site must contact the sponsor's medical monitor to discuss the 
patient circumstances, the Sponsor will decide if the patient can continue with PK period 2 with 
a delay. Similarly,  should the laboratory results on D15 in Stage 2 (the day of niraparib 
administration in PK Period 2) show changes in organ function such that the original inclusion 
criteria for laboratory values are no longer met, or in the event of a significant change of 
patient’s clinical status as judged by the Inv estigator, the site must consult with the Sponsor to 
discuss the patient's continued participation in PK period 2. Note that sites need not wait for the 
pre-dose laboratory results to begin PK period 2, but rather consult the Sponsor once the results 
are available as needed.   
Niraparib    
Clinical Study Protocol 3000 -01-004 Version 6.0   
Confidential   Page 42 of 103 In Stage 1 and 2, p atients who experience emesis within 9 hours of dosing or who miss a critical 
PK sample (such as the last PK sample on Day 8 in each Period  [Stage 3]) will be discontinued 
from the PK phase and will be allowed to be screened for the Extension Phase  (see Section  6.1).  
In Stage 3, patients  who experience emesis within 10 hours of dosing or miss sufficient samples 
to render calculation of AUC unreliable will be discontinued from the PK phase . Patients may 
also be identified and discontinued from the PK phase as non-evaluable due to issues arising 
during the study conduct ( Section 7.4.1). Patients who are discontinued from the PK phase  and 
meet other criteria for continued niraparib therapy will be eligible to be screened for th e 
Extension Phase (see Section  6.1). 
The PK parameters that will be estimated include area under the plasma concentration -time 
curve (AUC) from time 0 to the time of the last quantifiable concentration (AUC 0-t), area under 
the plasma concentration -time curve from time 0 extrapolated to infinity (AUC 0-∞), apparent total 
body clearance (CL/F), C max, tmax, terminal elimination half -life (t1/2), apparent ter minal volume 
of distribution (Vz/F), and bioavailability/bioequivalence of the tablet formulation relative to the 
capsule formulation.  
For Stage 2, the same PK parameters as above will be estimated. To conclude bioequivalence, 
the 90% CI of the ratio of ge ometric least -squares means of the test (tablet) to reference (capsule) 
product should be within 0.800 - 1.250 for AUC 0-∞ AUC0-t and Cmax. 
For Stage 3, the same PK parameters as above will be estimated. In addition, t lag, the time from 
administration of th e dose to the first quantifiable concentration, will be determined, and t max will 
be compared between the fed and fasted states. The relative bioavailability  of the 300 mg 
niraparib tablet administered with a high -fat meal relative to fasted dosing will be  based on the 
ratio of geometric least -squares means of AUC 0-t, AUC 0-∞, and C max.  
Additional PK parameters may be estimated (e.g., residual area)  if deemed appropriate.  
Extension Phase:  When patients complete the PK Phase of the study (at least 7 days fr om 
niraparib, dose 2 ), the Sponsor will work with the Investigator to determine if the patient would 
benefit from continued access to niraparib therapy. Eligibility to participate in the Extension 
Phase will be at the discretion of the Investigator  and Sponsor and will follow review of the 
study’s Extension Phase ’s respective  inclusion criteria and completion of the required screening 
assessments. Continued treatment in the study will be based on documented evidence of clinical 
benefit determined by local standard of care  disease assessment frequency.   
The starting dose of niraparib in the Extension Phase will be based on the patient’s baseline 
actual body weight or platelet count. Patients with a baseline actual body weight of ≥77 kg and 
screening platelet count of ≥150,000/µL (obtained after completion of the PK phase, as part of 
Extension Phase screening) will take one 300 mg strength tablet or 3 x 100 mg tablets/capsules at 
each dose administration (QD). Patients with a baseline actual body weight of <77 kg or 
screening platelet count of <150,000/µL will take one 200 mg strength tablet or 2 x 100 mg 
tablets/capsules at each dose administration (QD). For patients w hose initial starting dose is 200 
mg QD, escalation to 300 mg QD is permitted after 2 cycles of therapy if no treatment 
interruption or discontinuation was required during the first 2 cycles of Extension Phase therapy 
and after approval from the Sponsor. A dditional dose modifications will not be based upon 
changes in the patient’s actual body weight during study participation. If laboratory values at the 
Niraparib    
Clinical Study Protocol 3000 -01-004 Version 6.0   
Confidential   Page 43 of 103 beginning of Extension Phase are outside of the range specified in the inclusion criteria, the 
patient may continue to participate in the study only upon Sponsor approval and with 
consideration for an appropriately reduced dose. Should a patient start Extension Phase at 100 
mg, consideration may be given to escalate to 200 mg after 2 cycles  of therapy if no treatment 
interruption or discontinuation was required during the first 2 cycles of Extension Phase therapy 
and after approval from the Sponsor.  
Patients have up to 28 days (21 days for S tage 3 only; up to 28 days may be acceptable following 
discussion bet ween the Sponsor and Investigator) after completion of the PK Phase to complete 
the screening assessments and the Screening Visit.  
A tumor assessment is to be performed prior to the first dose of the Extension (pre -Extension 
Phase). The pre -Extension Phas e tumor assessment need not be completed if the baseline tumor 
assessment was performed ≤56 days before the first dose of the Extension Phase.  
The Cycle 1/Day 1 Visit can occur on the same day as the Extension Phase Screening Visit, 
dependent upon availabi lity of radiographic results obtained ≤ 56 days of the first planned dose 
in the Extension Phase. If the Extension Phase Screening Visit and the Cycle 1/Day 1 Visit occur 
on the same day, the clinical laboratory results will be reviewed by the study person nel prior to 
study drug administration to ensure eligibility. At the Cycle 1/Day 1 Visit, patients will undergo 
safety assessments and will receive study drug supply for the duration of 1 cycle (300  mg or 200 
mg tablets of niraparib for QD dosing or 3 x 10 0 mg or 2 x 100 mg tablets/capsules of niraparib 
for QD dosing, depending upon availability). It is preferred that patients remain on the same 
formulation (tablet versus capsule) throughout the Extension  Phase. Patients will return on the 
first day of ever y treatment cycle (28 ± 7 days) to receive study drug and for safety assessments. 
Visits will continue approximately every 4  weeks until treatment discontinuation. In line with the 
niraparib US PI, dose interruption (no longer than 28  days) will be allowed  based on adverse 
events (AEs). In addition, dose reductions to 200  mg QD and subsequently to 100  mg QD will be 
allowed based on AEs (please refer to US PI). Any dose reductions differing from this must be 
discussed with the medical monitor. Patients can c ontinue in the Extension Phase until the 
patient meets 1  of the withdrawal criteria.  
EOT and Safety Follow -up Visits:  
The EOT visit will occur within 7 days of the decision to discontinue study treatment for any 
reason. Patient s who do not participate in the Extension Phase will also have an EOT visit within 
7 days of the decision to discontinue study. Should the first dose of a new anti -cancer therapy 
occur within 14 days of the decision to discontinue study treatment, all asses sments required for 
the Safety Follow -up visit should occur at the EOT visit and this visit will be considered the 
Safety Follow -up visit. If the first dose of the new anti -cancer therapy occurs >14 days of the 
decision to discontinue study, the Safety Fol low-up visit will occur 30+7 days after the last dose 
of the study drug, or at the start of any new anti -cancer therapy, whichever occur first.

Confidential   Page 45 of 103 Patients will receive a single dose of the study drug with approximately 250  ml of water on 
Day 1 of the Study Drug and Washout/PK period and subsequent Study Drug and PK period. 
Patients may take sips of water after the single dose and resume their regular diet 4  hours 
thereafter.  
In Stage 3, all patients should arrive at the clinic following an overnight fast for a minimum of  
10 hours. For patients taking niraparib with a high -fat meal, the  meal (see Appendix  E) should 
start 30 minutes before administration of niraparib. Patients should eat this meal in 30 minutes or 
less, and ever y effort should be made for the patient to complete the entire meal .. The dose of 
niraparib should be taken within 5 minutes of finishing the meal, with 240 mL (8 fluid ounces) of 
water. Patients taking the drug product in a fasted state should also take it with 240 mL of water. 
Additional water is allowed except for 1 hour before and 1 hour after drug administration. No 
food is allowed for at least 4 hours postdose in both treatment periods . 
6.1.2. General Study Conduct  
This study will consist of a Screenin g Period (Day -21 to Day -1), a PK Phase (Study Drug and 
Washout/PK period 1 and Study Drug and PK period 2), an EOT visit, and a Safety Follow -up 
Visit. When patients complete the PK Phase of the study  (at least 7 days from the beginning of 
PK period 2) , they may be eligible to participate in the Extension  Phase prior to EOT and Safety 
Follow-up Visits, following review of the Extension Phase inclusion criteria and completion of 
the required screening assessments.  See Section 6.1. 
Following informed consent, all patients will undergo screening procedures within 21  days prior 
to the first dose of study drug to determine eligibility for study entry. Screening procedures 
include medical, surgical, cancer, and medication history; complete physical examination, 
including vital signs, height, and weight; Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) 
performance status; clinical laboratory assessments (complet e blood count [CBC], chemistry, 
and urinalysis); pregnancy test for women of childbearing potential; baseline tumor assessment 
and electrocardiogram (ECG).  
Once randomized to either capsule to tablet crossover or tablet to capsule crossover, patients will 
receive a single dose of the formulation (tablet or capsule) in a fasted state  (Stage 1 and Stage 2) . 
Stage 1:  Following an 8-hour fast on Day 1  (see Section  6.1.1), patients will receive a single 
dose of the formulation (tablet [1 × 300 mg] or capsule [3 × 100 mg]) followed by a 7 -day (+ 1 
day) Washout/PK period followed by a dose of the alternate formulation also in a fasted state, 
followed by a 7 -day Washout/PK period. Patients receiving the tablet in the first treatment period 
will receive the capsules in the second treatment period and vice versa ( Figure 2). Extensive PK 
sampling will be carried out after niraparib dosing (see S ection 10.1). Blood will be collected 
during the study for PK assessments at the following time points relative to niraparib dosing: 
predose (30  minutes prior to dosing) and at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8 , 12, 24, 48, 72, 96, 120, and 
168 hours postdose.   
Stage 2: Following an 8 -hour fast on Day  1 (see Section  6.1.1), patients will receive a single dose 
of the formulation (tablet [1 × 300 mg] or capsule [3 × 100 mg]) followed by a 14 -day (+/- 4 days) 
Washout/PK period followed by a dose of the alternate formulation also in a fasted state, 
followed by a 7 -day Washout/PK period. Patients receiving the ta blet in the first treatment period 
will receive the capsules in the second treatment period and vice versa ( Figure 2). Extensive PK 
Niraparib    
Clinical Study Protocol 3000 -01-004 Version 6.0  
Confidential   Page 46 of 103 sampling will be car ried out after niraparib dosing (see S ection 10.1). Blood will be collected 
during the study for PK assessments at the following time points relative to niraparib dosing: 
predose (30  minutes prior to dosing) and at 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 12, 24, 48, 72, 96,120, and 
168 hours postdose . 
Stage 3: In period 1, patients will receive a single 300 mg niraparib tablet either following a 10-
hour fast or directly following consumption of a high -fat meal followed by a 14 -day (+4 days) 
PK sampling and washout period. In period 2, patients will be crossed over to r eceive a single 
300 mg niraparib tablet in a fasted state or with a high -fat meal, followed by a 7 -day PK 
sampling period. All patients will fast for a minimum of 4 hours postdose in both periods. 
Patients receiving the tablet in a fasted state in the firs t treatment period will receive the tablet 
with a high -fat meal in the second treatment period and vice versa. Extensive PK sampling will 
be carried out after niraparib dosing (see Section 10.1). Blood will be collected during the study 
for PK assessments at the following time points relative to niraparib dosing: predose (30  minutes 
prior to dosing) and at 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 12, 24, 48, 72, 96, 120, and 168 hours postdose.  
Safety assessments conducted throughout the study include symptom -directed physical 
examination, vital signs, ECOG performance status, clinical laboratory assessments (CBC, 
chemistry, and urinalysis) (Section  6.6.1). Laboratory results from D8 (start of PK Period 2) 
should be reviewed by the site personnel, and significant changes in renal or hepatic function 
compared t o baseline should be discussed with the sponsor.  
6.2. Number of Patients  
Approximately 24 patients will be enrolled in Stage 1, and approximately  170 will be enrolled in 
Stage 2 to ensure 100 evaluable patients for BE analysis . Approximately 20 patients will be  
enrolled in Stage 3 to ensure 16 evaluable patients for the FE analysis.  
6.3. Treatment Assignment  
6.3.1. Patient Identification  
All patients who enter into the screening period of the study (defined as the point at which the 
patient signs the Informed Consent Form [ ICF]) will receive a unique patient identification 
number. This number will be used to identify the patient throughout the study and must be used 
on all study documentation related to that patient. A patient will be considered enrolled when the 
patient has  been consented, screened, and all eligibility criteria have been confirmed in the 
electronic case report form (eCRF). The patient identification number must remain constant 
throughout the entire study, and it must not be changed at the time of enrollment.  
6.3.2. Randomization Scheme  
Randomization will occur centrally using an interactive voice response system/integrated web 
response system. In Stage 1 and Stage 2, subjects will be assigned randomly in a 1:1 ratio to a 
dosing sequence: capsule formulation followed by tablet formulation , or vice versa.  In Stage 3, 
subjects will be assigned randomly in a 1:1 ratio to a dosing sequence: dosing after receiving a 
high-fat meal (fed) followed by dosing after fasting, or vice versa.  The period between 
randomizatio n and Cycle  1/Day 1 should be no longer than 5 calendar days.

Clinical Study Protocol 3000 -01-004 Version 6.0  
Confidential   Page 47 of 103 6.4. Dose Adjustment Criteria  
6.4.1. Safety Criteria for Stopping Doses During PK Phase  
During the PK Phase, patients must be discontinued for any treatment -related nonhematologic 
National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.03 
(NCI-CTCAE v.4.03) Grade  3 or 4 AE or serious adverse event (SAE) that the Investigator 
considers to be related to the administration of niraparib and, in case this resulted in incomplete 
PK collection. Patients may be permitted to enter the Extension Phase at an appropriately 
reduced dose.  
6.4.2. Safety Criteria for Adjustment or Stopping Doses During Extension Phase  
During the Extension Phase, dose interruption and/or reduction may be implemented at any  time 
for any grade toxicity considered intolerable by the patient and per the US label. In addition, 
protocol-defined criteria for dose modification are discussed below.  
Treatment must be interrupted for any treatment -related nonhematologic NCI -CTCAE v.4. 03 
Grade 3 or 4 AE or SAE that the Investigator considers to be related to niraparib administration. 
If the toxicity is resolved to baseline or ≤Grade 1 within 28  days, the patient may restart 
treatment with niraparib but with an appropriate dose reduction  unless prophylaxis is considered 
feasible (Table 3). If the event recurs at a similar or worse grade, treatment should be interrupted 
again, and upon resolution, a further dose reduction must be made. If upon rechallenging  with 
niraparib at the lowest allowable dose, any NCI -CTCAE Grade  3 or 4 AEs, which the 
Investigator considers to be related to niraparib recur, the patient must be discontinued. At th e 
Investigator’s discretion, following dose interruption (no longer than 28  days), patients may be 
considered for dose reductions, provided that they have not already undergone the maximum

Clinical Study Protocol 3000 -01-004 Version 6.0  
Confidential   Page 48 of 103 Management of hematolo gic toxicities  (Guan, 2017) is described in Table 4. For Grade 3 or 4 
neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, or anemia, treatment with niraparib must be interrupted with 
weekly blood counts monitored until recovery to ≤Grade 1. Niraparib should be resumed with a 
dose level reduction at that time. Cytokines (granul ocyte colony stimulating factor [CSF]) may 
be administered as clinically indicated to manage febrile neutropenia according to local standard 
of care.  
For major surgery, up to 28  days of drug interruption is allowed.  
Thrombocytopenia is an expected event a ssociated with the use of niraparib and is described in 
the IB. Thrombocytopenia associated with the use of niraparib resolved upon treatment 
interruption and/or dose reduction. The occurrence of thrombocytopenia during Cycle  1 requires 
additional patient monitoring in order to identify hematologic changes early and prevent higher 
grade thrombocytopenic events. A weekly monitoring of CBC during the first month is 
mandatory.  
If a patient completes the first cycle with no incidence of hematologic toxicity req uiring dose 
interruption or modification, then CBC monitoring will proceed according to protocol every 
4 weeks, thereafter. If dose interruption or modification is required at any point on study, weekly 
CBC will be required for another 4  weeks after the AE  has been resolved, to ensure safety of the 
new dose, after which monitoring every 4  weeks may resume.  
It is strongly recommended to refer the patient to the hematologist for further evaluation if (1) 
transfusions are required on more than 2 occasions in t he absence of non -treatment related causes 
or (2) the treatment -related hematologic toxicities have not recovered to allow retreatment with 
niraparib after 4 weeks. If a diagnosis of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS)/acute myeloid 
leukemia (AML) is confirmed  by a hematologist, the patient must permanently discontinue study 
drug.

  1 When patients complete the PK Phase of the study  (at least 7 days from the beginning of PK period 2) , they will be eligible to participate in the Extension 
Phase following re -review of selected entry criteria and completion of the screening assessments. If laboratory values are outside of the range specified in the 
inclusion criteria, the patient may con tinue to participate in the study at the discretion of the Sponsor and Investigator with consideration for a reduced dose.  
   Patients have 28 days to complete the screening assessments. The Screening Visit and Cycle 1/Day 1 Visit can occur on the sam e day dependent upon 
availability of radiographic results obtained ≤ 56 days of the first planned dose in the Extension Phase.  
2 The intent of the 7 -day Day 1 window is to allow flexibility in schedu ling; please note study drug is dispensed in 31 -day increments.  
3  The EOT visit will occur within 7 days of the decision to discontinue study treatment for any reason. Patient s who do not participate in the Extension Phase 
will also have an EOT visit within 7 days of the decision to discontinue study. Should the first dose of a new anti -cancer therapy occur within 14 days of the 
decision to discontinue study treatment, all asses sments required for the Safety Follow -up visit should occur at the EOT visit and this visit will be considered 
the Safety Follow -up visit. If the first dose of the new anti -cancer therapy occurs >14 days of the decision to discontinue study, the Safety Fol low-up visit will 
occur 30+7 days after the last dose of the study drug, or at the start of any new anti -cancer therapy, whichever occur first.    
4 CBC to include: Hemoglobin, Platelet count, Mean corpuscular volume, White blood cell count, Differential white blood cell count. CBC needs to obtained 
within 72 hrs prior to starting C1D1 of the Extension Phase  and monthly for the next 10 months of niraparib treatment. CBC will be obtained periodicall y after 
this time to monitor for clinically significant changes in any hematological parameter during niraparib treatment.

6 Need not be repeated if done within 72 hours of dosing Day 1.  
7 Tumor assessment to be performed prior to the first dose of the Extension Phase (pre -Extension Phase). The pre -Extension Phase tumor assessment need not be 
performed if the baseline tumor assessment was perf ormed  ≤56 days before the first dose of the Extension Phase  
8 Tumor assessment via a CT or MRI scan of clinically indicated areas and evaluation of clinical signs and symptoms should be p erformed during the Extension 
Phase every three cycles (+/ - 7 days) or per the Institution’s standard practice. The Investigator will evaluate the patient scans and clinical symptoms to  
evaluate disease status and progression, discontinue niraparib and initiate s ubsequent anticancer treatment as necessary.  
9 AEs will be collected and recorded for each patient from the time of randomization and/or treatment assignment until 30 days after the last dose of study drug. 
SAEs are required to be captured through 90 days after the last dose of study drug (or until the start of alternate anticance r therapy, whichever occurs first). All 
SAEs assessed by the Investigator as related to the study drug and AESIs  will be collected and reported until study closeout (unless death or loss to follow -up 
occurs first) . Any pregnancies that occur within 180 days post -treatment will be reported. All AEs and SAEs experienced by a patient, irrespective of the 
suspected causality, will be monitored until the AE or SAE has resolved, until abnormal laboratory values have returned to baseline or normalized,  until there is 
a satisfactory explanation for the changes observed, until the patient is lost to follow -up, or until the patient h as died. 
10 Vital signs include BP, pulse, heart rate, and temperature. BP and heart  rate will be monitored weekly for the first 4  weeks of the Extension Phase  and monthly 
thereafter .

• Completion of t he required safety follow up  
• Withdrawal of consent by the patient, who is at any time free to discontinue their 
participation in the study  
• Death 
• Loss to follow -up 
• Sponsor decision to terminate study  
If a patient is lost to follow -up, attempts should be mad e to contact the patient to determine the 
reason for discontinuation. For patients who are lost to follow -up, at least 3 documented 
attempts, including one via certified mail, should be made to contact the patient before 
considering the patient lost to fol low-up. 
7.4.4. Replacement of Patients  
Patients will not be replaced during Stage 1 . During Stage s 2 and 3, the non-evaluability rate 
arising during the study conduct will be continuously monitored by the Sponsor  and the total 
number of enrolled patients  may be adjusted accordingly.   
7.5. Restrictions During Study  
Restrictions during the study include the following:  
1. No other anticancer therapy is permitted during the course of study drug for any patient. 
If the patient discontinues study drug, this restriction no longe r applies. Palliative 
radiotherapy is allowed for preexisting small areas of painful metastases that cannot be 
managed with local or systemic analgesics as long as no evidence of disease progression 
is present. Hormonal therapy is allowed provided an agent  listed in Appendix  D is used.  
For hormonal agents not listed in Appendix D, the Site must consult with the Sponsor 
regarding allowing patient on study. For patient taking hormonal agents, dose and 
regimen of hormonal agents should have been stable for at least 14 days prior to first do se 
and is not expected to change during PK periods 1 and 2.   
2. An increased risk of infection with the administration of live virus and bacterial vaccines 
has been observed with conventional chemotherapy drugs. Effects with niraparib are 
unknown, so live vi rus and bacterial vaccines should not be administered to patients in 
the study.  
3. P-glycoprotein inhibitors: amiodarone, azithromycin, captopril, carvedilol, 
clarithromycin, conivaptan, cyclosporine, diltiazem, dronedarone, erythromycin,

  felodipine, itracona zole, ketoconazole, lopinavir and ritonavir, quercetin, quinidine, 
ranolazine, ticagrelor, and verapamil are not permitted per protocol unless the dose and 
regimen has been stable for at least 14 days prior to first dose and will not change during 
PK periods 1 and 2 ( does not apply for Extension Phase).  
4. Patient taking proton pump inhibitors, antacids, or H2 blocker within 48  of dose (Does 
not apply for Extension Phase).  
5. Patients who are blood donors should not donate blood during the study and for 90  days 
after the last dose of study drug.  
6. Patients must be able to fast for  10 hours before and 4 hours after dosing in the 2  PK 
dosing periods . 
7. Patients must avoid alcohol intake during the PK portion of the study.   
8. Grapefruit and grapefruit juice is not allowed 7 days before or 2 days after dosing in the 
PK portion of the study (does not apply for Extension Phase).  
9. Administration of blood or platelet transfusion should be avoided during the PK 
Phase. Should administr ation of blood products or other colloid solutions become 
necessary during the PK Phase the site must contact the Sponsor to discuss timing of 
blood (or other product) administration in relation to the timing of PK sampling.  
10. Patient is currently taking a l ipase inhibitor or cholesterol absorption inhibitor, such as 
orlistat or e zetimibe, respectively .  (Does not apply for participation in Extension Phase 
of this study) . 
7.5.1. Lifestyle Considerations  
Cases of photosensitivity have been reported for patients on n iraparib treatment. Participants 
must be informed on measures to decrease exposure to ultraviolet light, such as minimizing time

8.2. Concomitant Medications  
Any medication the patient takes during the study other than the study drugs, including herbal 
and other nontraditional remedies, is considered a concomitant medication. All concomitant 
medications must be recorded in the  eCRF. The following information must be recorded in the 
eCRF for each concomitant medication: generic name, route of administration, start date, stop 
date, dosage, and indication. Any changes in the dosage or regimen of a concomitant medication 
must be al so recorded in the eCRF.  
At Screening Visit, patients will be asked what medications they have taken during the last 
30 days. At each subsequent study visit, patients will be asked what concomitant medications 
they are currently taking or have taken since the previous visit.  
8.2.1. Permitted Concomitant Medications  
Denosumab and bisphosphonates are allowed while on study.  
Prophylactic antiemetics are allowed while on study. Should they be used, the same antiemetic 
prophylaxis MUST be administered in conjunction wi th Days 1 and 15 niraparib dosing in the 
PK Phase and within the same time interval from niraparib administration.

Confident ial  Page 72 of 103 
  8.2.2. Concomitant Medications Taken with Caution 
Niraparib weakly induces cytochrome P450 (CYP)1A2  in vitro and is an insensitive substrate for 
P-glycoprotein (P -gp); therefore, investigators should be advised to use caution with drugs that 
are the sensitive substrates for CYP1A2 with a narrow therapeutic range, i.e. theophylline and 
tizanidine.  
8.3. Contraception  
Niraparib is known to have properties that require the female patient of childbearing potential to 
use a highly effective form of contraception. For details on contracept ive guidelines , please refer 
to Appendix  C. 
Male patients must use an adequate method of contraception and not donate sperm starting with 
the first dose of study drug through 90  days after the last dose of study drug ( Table 10). For a 
non-pregnant woman of childbearing potential partner, contraception recommendations should 
also be considered. Abstinence is acceptable if this is the established and preferred contra ception 
method for the patient.  
Patients should be informed that taking the study drug may involve unknown risks to the fetus if 
pregnancy were to occur during the study. In order to participate in the study, both male and 
female patients must adhere to th e contraception requirement (described above) for the duration 
of the study and through 90 and 180  days, respectively, after the last study drug. This applies to 
female study patients and partners of male study patients. If there is any question that a pat ient 
will not reliably comply with the requirements for contraception, that patient should not be 
entered into the study.

8.4. Treatment Compliance  
Compliance with inclusion and exclusion criteria will be assessed as outlined in Section  7.1 
and Section 7.2, respectively.  
Niraparib will be administered by site personnel at study sites as detailed in Section  9.5. 
Study drug accountability will be monitored as detailed in  Section 9.6.

  9. STUDY DRUG MATERIALS  AND MANAGEMENT  
9.1. Study Drug  
Niraparib is a PO available, potent, highly selective PARP1 and PARP2 inhibitor. The excipients 
for niraparib are lactose monohydrate and magn esium stearate. Niraparib will be supplied as 
100 mg capsules and 300, 200, and 100 mg tablets.   
9.2. Study Drug Packaging and Labeling  
Niraparib 100  mg capsules may be packed in high -density polyethylene bottles with 
child-resistant closures or in blister card s.  
Niraparib 100 mg, 200  mg and 300  mg tablets will be provided in high -density polyethylene 
bottles. Additional information on packaging can be found in the Pharmacy Manual.  
The label text of the study drug will comply with Good Manufacturing Practice a nd the national 
legislation to meet the requirements of the United States. The study drug will be open -label and 
nonpatient -specific. 
9.3. Study Drug Storage  
All study drug supplies must be stored in accordance with the Pharmacy Manual instructions and 
package labeling. Until dispensed or administered to the patients, the study drug will be stored in 
a securely locked area, accessible to authorized personnel only.  
The pharmacist will dispense study drug for each patient according to the protocol and Pharmacy 
Manual, if applicable.  
9.4. Study Drug Administration  
The Pharmacy Manual contains descriptions of the packaging of study drug and instructions for 
administration of study drug.  
9.5. Administration  
Niraparib as 100 mg capsules and 300, 200, and 100  mg tablets will be supplied (Table 9). In the 
Stage 1 and 2 PK Phase s, patients will receive a single dose (300  mg) of the study drug 
(tablet [1× 300 mg] or capsule [3 × 100 mg]) in a fasted state (see Section  6.1.1) followed by a 7 -
day (+1 day) for Stage 1 of the study and a 14 -day (+/- 4 days) Washout/PK period for Stage 2 of 
the study, followed by a dose of the alternate formulation (patients receiving tablets in the first 
treatment period will receive the capsule in the second treatment period and vice versa).  
For Stage 3 during period 1, patients will receive a single 300 mg niraparib tablet either 
following a 10 hour fast or directly following consumption of a high -fat meal followed by a 14 -
day (+4 days) PK sampling and washout period. In period 2, patients will be crossed over to 
receive a single 300 mg niraparib tablet in a fasted state  or with a high -fat meal (see 
Section 6.1.1), followed by a 7 -day PK sampling period. Patients re ceiving the tablet in a fasted 
state in the first treatment period will receive the tablet with a high -fat meal in the second 
treatment period and vice versa.  
Niraparib    
Clinical Study Protocol 3000 -01-004 Version 6.0   
Confident ial  Page 74 of 103 
  In the Extension Phase, the starting dose of niraparib will be based on the patient’s baseline 
actual body weight or platelet count. Patients with a baseline actual body weight of ≥77 kg and 
screening platelet count of ≥150,000/µL will take one 300 mg strength tablet or 3 x 100 mg 
tablets/capsules at each dose administration. Patients with a baseline  actual body weight of <77 
kg or screening platelet count of <150,000/µL will take one 200 mg strength tablet or 2 x 100 mg 
tablets/capsules at each dose administration. For patients whose initial starting dose is 200 mg 
QD, escalation to 300 mg once daily is permitted if no treatment interruption or discontinuation 
was required during the first 2 cycles of Extension Phase therapy and with Sponsor’s approval. 
Additional dose modifications will not be based upon changes in the patient’s actual body weight 
during study participation. If laboratory values at the beginning of Extension Phase are outside of 
the range specified in the inclusi on criteria, the patient may continue to participate in the study 
only upon Sponsor approval and with consideration for an appropriately reduced dose. Should a 
patient start the Extension Phase at 100 mg, consideration may be given to escalate to 200 mg 
after 2 cycles  of therapy if no treatment interruption or discontinuation was required during the 
first 2 cycles of Extension Phase therapy and after approval from the Sponsor.    
9.6. Study Drug Accountability  
Accountability of the investigational study drugs is under the responsibility of the Investigator 
and can be delegated to an appropriately qualified person.  
Study drug accountability should be maintained by each site based on investigational study drug 
dispensed versus returned to the clinic at each visit an d the number days since last visit.  
Details of maintaining drug accountability, including information on the accountability log, will 
be provided in the Pharmacy Manual.  
All dispensation and accountability records will be available for Sponsor review. The study 
monitor will assume the responsibility to reconcile the study drug accountability log. The 
pharmacist will dispense study drug for each patient according to the protocol and Pharmacy 
Manual, if applicable.  
9.7. Study Drug Handling and Disposal  
At the end of study, when all patients have stopped protocol treatment, complete drug 
reconciliation per batch should be available at the site for verification in order to allow drug 
destruction or return procedure. After receiving Sponsor approval in writing, the in vestigational 
site is responsible for destruction of study drug according to local regulations. If a site does not 
have the capability for onsite destruction, the Sponsor will provide a return for destruction 
service to a third party. Both the unused and e xpired study drug must be destroyed, upon 
authorization of the Sponsor, according to local regulations and procedures, and a copy of the 
destruction form must be filed in the study binder.  
The medication provided for this study is to be used only as indica ted in this protocol and only 
for the patients entered in this study.

  11.2. Adverse Events and Special Situations  
11.2.1. Definitions  
11.2.1.1. Adverse Event (AE)  
Any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a 
medicinal product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this 
treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including a clinically 
significant abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally 
associated with the use of study treatment, whether or not considered related to the product.   
AEs may include the onset of new illness and the exacerbation of pre -existing medical 
conditions. An AE can include an undesirable medical condition occurring at any time after the 
time of randomization and/or treatment assignment, including baseline or washout periods, even 
if no study treatment has been administered ( see Section 11.2.3 for information about AE 
collecting and reporting.)  
11.2.1.2.  Serious Ad verse Event (SAE)  
Any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose;  
• Results in death;  
• Is life threatening (i.e., an event in which the patient was at risk of death at the time of 
the event; it does not refer to an event that hypothetically might have cau sed death if 
it were more severe);  
• Requires inpatient hospitalization* or prolongation of existing hospitalization;  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity;  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect; or  
• Is an important medical event**  
*Exception: Preplanned (at time of informed consent) hospitalization for elective procedures, for 
protocol compliance or social reasons, or for observation will not be considered criteria for an 
SAE. The reason for the planned hospitalization should be cap tured in medical history section in 
the eCRF. Complications experienced during these hospitalizations must be reported as AEs (or 
SAEs, if hospitalization is prolonged due to the AE).  
**Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in determining wh ether situations or 
events should be considered serious adverse events: an important medical event may not be 
immediately life -threatening or result in death or require hospitalization but may jeopardize the 
patient or require intervention to prevent one o f the above outcomes. Examples of such events 
are allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias, or convulsions that may require intensive treatment 
in an emergency room or at home but do not result in hospitalization, development of drug 
dependency or drug abus e, and transmission of disease associated with the administration of the 
study drug. (See Section  11.2.5 for information about SAE reporting.)

  11.2.1.3. Treatment-Emergent Adverse Event (TEAE)  
Any event that was not present prior to the initiation of study treatment or any event already 
present that worsens in either intensity or frequency following exposure to study treatment.  
11.2.1.4. Adverse Events of Special Intere st (AESI)  
Any AE (serious or non -serious) that is of scientific and medical concern specific to the study 
treatment, for which ongoing monitoring and rapid communication by the Investigator to the 
Sponsor is appropriate.  
11.2.1.5. Special Situation: Abuse, Misuse, Medication Errors, Overdose, and Accidental 
or Occupational Exposure  
• Abuse: is the persistent or sporadic, intentional excessive use of the study treatment 
which is accompanied by harmful physical or psychological effects.  
• Misuse: medicinal product is int entionally and inappropriately used not in accordance 
with the authorized/approved product information.  
• Medication error:  is any preventable incident that may cause or lead to inappropriate 
study treatment use or patient harm while the study treatment is i n the control of the 
health care professionals or patients. Such incident may be due to health care 
professional practice, product labeling, packaging and preparation, procedures for 
administration, and systems, including the following: prescribing, order 
communication, nomenclature, compounding, dispensing, distribution, 
administration, education, monitoring, and use.  
• Overdose:  is a deliberate or accidental administration of study treatment to a study 
patient, at a dose greater than that which was assigned  to that patient per the study 
protocol and under the direction of the Investigator. If an overdose occurs, the 
Investigator and the Sponsor should be notified immediately, and the patient should 
be observed closely for AEs. Associated AEs should be treate d and monitored by the 
Investigator. The dosage of study drug administered, any associated AEs, and/or 
treatment provided to the patient because of the overdose, should be documented on 
the applicable sections within the eCRF. An overdose (including an AE or SAE 
resulting from the overdose, if any) will be reported as described in Section  11.2.5. 
• Accidental /Occupational exposure:  is the unintentional exposure to a study 
treatment as a result of one’s professional or non -professional occupation, or 
accidental exposure to a non -professional to whom exposure was not intended (i.e., 
study product given to wrong patient).  
Reporting Spe cial Situations:  All occurrences of abuse, misuse, medication error, overdose, and 
accidental or occupational exposure with any study treatment must be reported on an SAE 
Report Form [or designated Special Form] to the Sponsor regardless of whether or not an AE or 
SAE has occurred. If the abuse, misuse, medication error, overdose, or accidental / occupational 
exposure is associated with an SAE, an SAE report form must be submitted to the Sponsor 
within 24 hours of awareness. If there is no AE or SAE, the oc currence must be submitted on the 
designated Special Form (indicate ‘no AE has occurred’) as soon as possible.

Confident ial  Page 82 of 103 
  11.2.2. Assessment of Adverse Events  
11.2.2.1. Severity Assessment  
All AEs will be assessed by the Investigator for severity according to Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v4.03: 14 June 2010; National Institutes of Health (NIH), 
National Cancer Institute (NCI). The CTCAE severity grades 1 through 5 provide unique clinical 
descriptions of severity of each adverse event. The CTCAE v4.03 is availa ble on the NCI/NIH 
website. 
Please note that there is a distinction between serious and severe AEs. Severity is a measure of 
intensity whereas seriousness  is defined by the criteria in Section  11.2.1.2. For example, a mild 
degree of gastrointestinal bleeding requiring an overnight hospitalization for monitoring 
purposes may be considered an SAE but is not necessarily severe.  
11.2.2.2. Relationship to Study Inter vention 
The Investigator must provide a causality assessment regarding the relationship of the event with 
the study drug and/or study procedure for all AEs. One of the following categories should be 
selected based on medical judgment, considering all contr ibuting factors:  
• Related: A causal relationship between the medicinal product (and/or study 
procedures) and AE is a reasonable possibility. For example, the occurrence of the 
AE cannot be explained by other causative factors. The AE, however, can be 
explained by pharmacological effect of the medicinal product such as a similar event 
having been reported previously, alteration of the dose effect, or the timing or 
seriousness of the AE, etc. Positive rechallenge/dechallenge  is supportive.  
• Not Related : A causal relationship between the medicinal product (and/or study 
procedures) and AE is not a reasonable possibility: there is no temporal relationship 
between the medicinal product and event, or an alternative etiology is more 
reasonable.  
11.2.2.3. Expectedness  
The Spon sor will be responsible for determining whether an adverse event is ‘expected’ or 
‘unexpected’. An AE will be considered unexpected if the nature, severity, or frequency of the 
event is not consistent with the risk information provided in the Reference Saf ety Information of 
the effective niraparib Investigator Brochure (IB).  
11.2.3. Collection and Recording of Adverse Events  
AEs may be volunteered spontaneously by the study patient, or discovered by the study staff 
during physical examinations or by asking an open,  nonleading question such as, “How have you 
been feeling since your last study visit?” The Investigator will document the nature of AE, date 
of onset of the AE (and time, if known), date of outcome of the AE (and time, if known), 
severity of the AE, action  taken with study drug as a result of the AE, assessment of the 
seriousness of the AE, and assessment of the causal relationship of the AE to study drug and/or 
study procedure.  
Niraparib    
Clinical Study Protocol 3000 -01-004 Version 6.0   
Confident ial  Page 83 of 103 
  AEs, including laboratory abnormalities that are assessed as clinically signifi cant or require 
intervention, should be described using a diagnosis whenever possible, rather than individual 
underlying signs and symptoms. When a clear diagnosis cannot be identified, each sign or 
symptom should be recorded as a separate AE.  
All SAEs wil l be collected from the signing of the ICF for this study through 90 days after the 
last dose of study drug (or until the start of alternate anticancer therapy, whichever occurs first) , 
and recorded in the eCRF. SAEs will also be reported on an SAE form as  described in 
Section 11.2.5 of this protocol. SAEs considered by the Investigator to be related to study 
medication are reported until study closeout.  
All AEs, regardless of the source of identification (e.g., physical  examination, laboratory 
assessment, ECG, or reported by patient), will be collected and recorded in the eCRF for each 
patient from the time of randomization and/or treatment assignment until 30 days after the last 
dose of study drug.  
Concomitant illnesses  that existed before entry into the study will not be considered AEs unless 
the illness worsens during the Treatment Period. Pre -existing conditions will be recorded as 
Medical History in the eCRF and on the SAE Report Form.  
Disease progression is an effic acy criterion and is therefore not considered an AE or SAE (even 
if fatal). Disease progression should be reported within the appropriate eCRF. If AEs/SAEs 
occur in relation to disease progression that are not consistent with the natural progression of the  
patient’s disease, these AEs/SAEs must be reported per AE/SAE reporting requirements 
described in Section  11.2.5. 
11.2.4. Follow-Up of Adverse Events  
All AEs experienced by a patient, regardless of the suspected causality, will be monitored until 
the AE or SAE has resolved, until AE(s) or SAE(s) have returned to baseline or normal levels, 
until stabilized with a satisfactory explanation for the changes observ ed, until the patient is lost 
to follow-up, or until the patient has died, starts alternate anti -cancer therapy, or until the patient 
withdraws consent.  
If an Investigator becomes aware of an SAE after the specified follow -up period and considers 
the SAE related to the study drug, the Investigator should report the SAE to the Sponsor 
according to timelines for reporting SAEs described in Section  11.2.5. 
11.2.5. Reporting  
The Investigator must report all SAEs, and all follow up information to the Sponsor on an SAE 
Report Form within 24  hours of becoming aware of the initial event or follow -up information. 
The Investigator must provide a causality assessment  and must sign and date all SAE Report 
Forms. 
It is the responsibility of the Investigator to review source documentation and describe pertinent 
information on the SAE Report Form. If supporting documentation is requested (e.g., hospital 
reports, consultan t reports, death certificates, autopsy reports, etc.), the Investigator should 
highlight all relevant and pertinent information within such documents, ensure that any patient’s 
personal identifiers (including Medical Record number) are removed, and submit the documents 
Niraparib    
Clinical Study Protocol 3000 -01-004 Version 6.0   
Confident ial  Page 84 of 103 
  with the SAE Form to the Sponsor . The Sponsor (or designee) will return a confirmation of 
receipt for all email reports (if received from other than a “no reply” domain) within 1 business 
day.  
The minimum information required for an initial SAE report is:  
• Name of person sending the report (ie, name, address of Investigator)  
• Patient identification (screening/randomization number, initials [if permitted by local 
data privacy regulations], NOT patient name)  
− Protocol number  
• Description of SAE wit h diagnosis if possible  
− Causality assessment  
− Seriousness assessment  
The Sponsor (or designee) will confirm receipt of all email reports (as long as the email is not 
coming from “no reply” domain) within 1 business day.  
SAE REPORTING CONTACT INFORMATION  
 Email: OAX37649@gsk.com  
 Fax: +44(0) 208754 7822  
After receipt of the initial report, the Sponsor (or designee) will review the information and, if 
necessary, contact the Investigator to obtain further information. The Investigator must promptly 
respond to queries from the Sponsor.  
11.2.6. Submission and Distribution of Serious Adverse Event Reports  
Per regulatory requirements, if an event is assessed by the Sponsor as a Serious Unexpected 
Adverse Reaction (SUSAR), it is the responsibility of the Sponsor to submit  the SUSAR to 
Regulatory Authorities according to applicable regulations.  
In addition, the SUSAR will be distributed to the Investigators/sites, utilizing a Council for 
International Organizations of Medical Sciences (CIOMS) report form, or the MedWatch 35 00A 
form). The Investigator/site will submit a copy of the report to their respective Institutional 
Review Board (IRB) or Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) per the governing institutional 
requirements and in compliance with local laws and guidelines.  
11.2.7. Adverse Events of Special Interest  
Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESI) for niraparib are the following:  
• Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS) and Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)  
• Secondary cancers (new malignancies [other than MDS or AML])  
AESI should be coll ected and reported as follows:  
• MDS and AML along with other secondary cancers should be reported to the Sponsor 
until study closeout (unless death or loss to follow -up occurs first).  
•

  11.2.8. Hypertension, Including Hypertensive Crisis  
Hypertension, including hype rtensive crisis, has been reported with the use of niraparib. 
Preexisting hypertension should be adequately controlled before starting niraparib treatment. 
While receiving treatment, hypertension should be medically managed with antihypertensive 
medicinal products with or without niraparib dose adjustment.  
BP and heart rate should be monitored at least weekly for the first 2 months of niraparib 
treatment in the maintenance setting, then monthly for the first year and periodically thereafter 
during treatmen t with niraparib. Niraparib should be discontinued in case of hypertensive crisis 
or if medically significant hypertension cannot be adequately controlled with antihypertensive 
therapy. 
11.2.9. Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome  
There have been rare repo rts of niraparib -treated patients developing signs and symptoms that 
are consistent with posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES). PRES is a rare 
neurologic disorder that can present with the following signs and symptoms including seizures, 
headache, altered mental status, visual disturbance, or cortical blindness, with or without 
associated hypertension. A diagnosis of PRES requires confirmation by brain imaging, 
preferably MRI. In patients developing PRES, treatment of specific symptoms includi ng control 
of hypertension is recommended, along with discontinuation of niraparib. The safety of 
reinitiating niraparib therapy in patients previously experiencing PRES is not known.  
11.2.10. Allergic Reaction  
Niraparib capsules contain tartrazine, which may cause  allergic-type reactions.  
11.2.11. Pregnancy  
The Investigator must report all pregnancies and the outcomes to the Sponsor. The Sponsor has 
the responsibility to monitor the outcome of all pregnancies reported during the clinical study.  
Each pregnancy must be report ed by the Investigator to the Sponsor on an Initial Pregnancy 
Report Form within 24 hours of becoming aware of the pregnancy. Pregnancy is not an AE, and 
therefore does not need to be reported as an AE in the eCRF unless there is a suspicion that the 
study drug may have interfered with the effectiveness of a contraceptive medication. The 
Investigator must follow -up all pregnancies, document the course and the outcome, and report 
this information to the Sponsor on a Pregnancy Outcome Report Form within 24 ho urs of 
becoming aware; even if the patient was withdrawn from the study or the study has finished.  
An elective abortion without complications should not be regarded as an AE, however, it should 
be reported as the outcome to the pregnancy on the Pregnancy O utcome Report Form . 
Therapeutic abortions should be reported as a treatment procedure; the reason for the therapeutic 
abortion should be reported on the Pregnancy Outcome Report Form  and as an AE in the eCRF. 
Hospitalization for normal delivery of a healthy newborn should not be considered an SAE.  
Any SAE that occurs during pregnancy must be recorded on the Pregnancy Outcome Report 
Form, reported as an SAE on the SAE Report Form  (e.g., maternal serious complications, 
therapeutic abortion, ectopic pregnancy, stillbirth, neonatal death, congenital anomaly, birth 
Niraparib    
Clinical Study Protocol 3000 -01-004 Version 6.0   
Confident ial  Page 86 of 103 
  defect) and reported to the Sponsor within 24 hours. Hospitalization for normal delivery of a 
healthy newborn should not be con sidered an SAE.  
11.2.12. Special Situations  
All occurrences of abuse, misuse, medication error, overdose, and accidental or occupational 
exposure with any study treatment must be reported on a Special Situations Report Form to the 
Sponsor within 5 calendar days of  becoming aware of the occurrence, regardless of whether it is 
categorized as an AE. If the occurrence is associated with an SAE, an SAE Report Form , along 
with the Special Situations Report Form , must be submitted to the Sponsor within 24 hours of 
awareness.

Confident ial  Page 88 of 103 
  The final analysis of bioequivalenc e will be based on Stage 2 BA/BE evaluable patients only, 
with a target sample size of 100 evaluable patients . Patients may be identified as non -evaluable 
due to issues arising during the study conduct, such as:  
• emesis within 9 hours of dosing,  
• dosing err ors,  
• patient did not fast prior to dosing,  
• missing critical PK sample on Day 8 ,  
• failure to complete both PK periods, and  
• significant changes to the patient medical status that would potentially affect the PK 
profile as determined by the Sponsor in consultation with the Investigator prior to PK data 
analysis.  
In this patient population, approximately 170 total patients are targeted for enrollment, assuming 
a 35% non -evaluability rate during the study conduct, and an additional 10% non -evaluabilit y 
rate during PK analysis.  The non-evaluability rate arising during the study conduct will be 
continuously monitored by the Sponsor  and the total number of enrolled patients  may be adjusted 
accordingly with the aim to target the resulting sample size of 10 0 BA/BE evaluable patients.   
Stage 3 
Assuming the true ratio of means is 1 and the intra -subject CV is 20% for AUC0-t and AUC0-∞, 
with 16 evaluable patients , there is approximately  83% probability  the 90% CI of the ratio of 
geometric means will be within 0.800 and 1.250. Based on the results of a FE study conducted 
using the capsule formulation, an effect of a high -fat meal on C max is possible. The sample size of 
16 patients is deemed adequate to characterize this effect. AUC0-t and AUC 0-∞ will be the 
primary parameters for analysis.   
The primary analysis will be based on the FE Evaluable Population as it is the most conservative 
approach, which maximizes the benefits of the crossover design, where each patient serves as 
their own control. Results fo r the PK Evaluable Population will also be summarized and reported 
for this study.  
To account for non -evaluable patients, approximately 20 total patients are targeted for 
enrollment. The final analysis will be based on Stage 3 FE evaluable patients only.  Patients may  
be identified as non -evaluable due to issues arising during the study conduct, such as:  
• dosing errors ,  
• patient did not follow dietary requirements prior to dose and postdose ,  
• failure to complete both PK periods , and 
• significant changes to the patient medical status that would potentially affect the PK 
profile as determined by the Sponsor in consultation with the Investigator prior to PK 
data analysis.  
Patients who vomit within 10 hours of dosing or miss sufficient sa mples to render calculation of 
AUC unreliable will be discontinued from the PK phase; those that meet other criteria for 
Niraparib

Confident ial  Page 89 of 103 
  continued niraparib therapy will be eligible to be screened for the Extension Phase (see 
Section 6.1). The non-evaluability rate arising during the study conduct will be continuously 
monitored by the Sponsor  and the total number of enrolled patients  may be adjusted accordingly 
with the aim to target the resulting sample size of 16 evaluable patients.   
12.3. Safety Analyses  
Data from the Stage 1 PK Phase, Stage 2 PK Phase , Stage 3 PK Phase and Extension Phase will 
be summarized separately. Summaries will be performed by formulation , fed/fasted state and 
dosing period as applicable. The safety population will consist of all patients who receive drug.  
Demographic characteristics will be summarized descriptively and will include age, sex, race, 
height, and weight.  
Protocol deviations will b e listed by patient.  
All analysis for safety endpoints will be done in a descriptive manner. Continuous variables will 
be summarized using descriptive statistics (number of patients, mean, standard deviation [SD], 
minimum, median, and maximum). Categorical  variables will be summarized using counts of 
patients and percentages.  All AEs will be coded using the most up -to-date version of MedDRA. 
NCI-CTCAE v.4.03 will be used to grade the severity of AEs and laboratory abnormalities.  
All AEs will be listed. The  number and percent of patients who experience  a TEAE will be 
summarized by formulation , fed/fasted state and dosing period as applicable for each system 
organ class and preferred term. TEAEs will also be tabulated accordingly by intensity and 
causality.  
An analysis of AEs will include the following categories:  
• TEAEs 
• Drug-related TEAEs  
• Grade 3, 4, and 5 TEAEs (presented by grade and overall)  
• Grade 3, 4, and 5 drug -related TEAEs (presented by grade and overall)  
• TEAEs resulting in study drug discontinuation  
• Most commonly reported TEAEs  
• Treatment -emergent SAEs  
• AESIs 
Individual data listings of laboratory test results will be presented. Flags will be attached to 
values outside of the laboratory's reference limits along with the Investigator's assessment. 
Clinically significant laboratory test abnormalities that were considered AEs by the Investigator 
will be presented in the AE listing.  
In addition, for the Extension  Phase, clinical laboratory tests (observed values and changes from 
baseline) will be summa rized descriptively in tabular format. Shift tables will be presented for 
select laboratory parameters (chemistry and hematology).

each patient. Individual cl inically significant vital sign findings that were considered AEs by the 
Investigator will be presented in the AE listing.  
All clinically relevant physical examination findings will be listed.  
12.4. Pharmacokinetic Analysis  
Individual and mean plasma concentrati ons over time will be plotted by formulation for the 300 -
mg dose group  in Stage 1 and 2 and by fed/fasted state in Stage 3 . Planned sampling times will 
be used to generate the mean concentration -time profiles.  
Individual patient PK parameter values will be  derived by non -compartmental methods using 
WinNonlin, version 5.1 or higher. Actual time will be used in parameter estimation.  The analysis 
of Stage 1 , Stage 2, and Stage 3 will be conducted separately.  
During the pharmacokinetic analysis, the following rules will apply : 
• Predose sample >5% of C max: profile will be excluded from PK concentration and PK 
parameters summary and inferential statistics  
• Rsq,adj <0.800: AUC 0-∞, λz, CL/F, Vz/F, and t 1/2 will be excluded from descriptive and  
inferential statistics 
• AUC0-t /AUC0-∞, <0.800: AUC 0-∞ and parameters derived from it will be excluded from 
descriptive and inferential statistics   
Individual and mean plasma concentrations over time will be plotted by formulation  in Stage 1 
and 2 and by fed/fasted s tate in Stage 3 . The individual plasma concentration versus actual time 
profiles for each subject, as well as the mean plasma conce ntration versus scheduled time 
profiles for each treatment, will be presented graphically on a linear -linear and log -linear scale. 
Combined individ ual concentration versus time graphs per treatment will also be presented, 
together with  mean values. Plasma concentrations and PK parameters will be summarized in 
terms of the number of patients, arithmetic mean, median, SD, coeffic ient of variation (CV), 
geometric mean, geometric CV, minimum and maximum by formulation  in Stage 1 and 2 and by 
fed/fasted state in Stage 3 , across the PK, PK Evaluable , BA/BE Evaluable  and FE Evaluable  
populations, as appropriate . In Stage 3, differences in t max between the fed and fasted state will be 
assessed and summarized based on the FE Evaluable Population. Details will be provided in the 
Pharmacokinetic Analysis Plan.  
To assess relative bioavailability/bioequivalence, an ana lysis of variance model (ANOVA) will 
be used on logarithmically transformed  AUC0-t, AUC0-∞, and Cmax accounting for the following 
sources of variation: sequence, subjects nested in sequences, period and treatment. The point 
estimate and 90% CIs for the rat ios of the geometric means of the test treatment (tablet) 
compared to the reference treatment (capsule) will be obtained. Bioequivalence will be claimed 
if the 90% CI for the ratio of geometric means is between 0.800 and 1.250 for AUC 0-t, AUC0-∞, 
and Cmax. To assess  the effect of food for Stage 3 , the ratio of geometric means of the  test 
treatment ( high-fat meal) and corresponding 90% CI compared to the reference treatment (fasted 
state) will be obtained  for AUC0 -t, AUC0 -∞, and C max.

  13. DIRECT ACCESS TO SOU RCE DATA/DOCUMENTS  
13.1. Study Monitoring  
Before an investigational site can enter a patient into the stud y, a representative of the Sponsor  
will visit the investigational study site to:  
• Determine the adequacy of the facilities  
• Discuss with the investigator(s) and other personnel their responsibilities with regard to 
protocol adherence, and the responsibilitie s of the Sponsor  or its representatives. This 
will be documented in a Clinical Study Agreement between the Sponsor  and the 
investigator.  
During the study, a monitor from the Sponsor  or representative will have regular contacts with 
the investigational site , for the following:  
• Provide information and support to the investigator(s)  
• Confirm that facilities remain acceptable  
• Confirm that the investigational team is adhering to the protocol, that data are being 
accurately recorded in the case report forms (CRFs) , and that investigational product 
accountability checks are being performed  
• Perform source data verification. This includes a comparison of the data in the CRFs with 
the patient’s medical records at the hospital or practice, and other records relevant to the 
study. This will require direct access to all original records for each patient (eg, clinic 
charts). 
• Record and report any protocol deviations not previously sent to the Sponsor . 
• Confirm AEs and SAEs have been properly documented on CRFs and confirm any SAEs 
have been forwarded to the Sponsor  and those SAEs that met criteria for reporting have 
been forwarded to the IRB.  
The monitor will be available between visits if the investigat or(s) or other staff needs 
information or advice.  
13.2. Audits and Inspections  
Authorized representatives of the Sponsor , a regulatory authority, an IEC or an IRB may visit the 
site to perform audits or inspections, including source data verification. The purpose of a the 
Sponsor audit or inspection is to systematically and independently examine all study -related 
activities and documents to determine whether these activities were conducted, and data were 
recorded, analyzed, and accurately reported according to the protocol, Good Clinical Practice 
(GCP) guidelines of the International Council for Harmonization (ICH), and any applicable 
regulatory requirements. The investigator should contact the Sponsor  immediately if contacted 
by a regulatory agency about an inspection.

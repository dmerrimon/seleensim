 2 Introduction  
Neuromuscular blockers (NMB) are medications commonly used by anesthesiologists 
during surgery  to induce paralysis/muscle relaxation and facilitate the technical performance of 
surgery. However,  the residual effect of neuromuscular blockade during the imme diate 
postoperative period has been associated with an increased incide nce of postoperative pulmonary  
complications.  1-6. Residual neuromuscular blockade is a cont ributing factor to adverse events 
including delayed discharge from recovery, need for tracheal reintubation, impaired oxygenation 
and ventilation, aspiration, atelectasis and pneumonia.  3,6,7 These effects are likely mediated by 
decreased  airway tone and impaired respiratory effor t persisting during recovery from 
anesthesia .8,9 Despite awareness of this problem for the last 35 years, residual neuromuscular 
blockade after ane sthesia remains a common adverse event  and has been the  focus of initiatives 
by the Anesthesia Patie nt Safety Foundation as recently as February 2016.10,11 
Despite widespread utilization of NMB during cardiac surgery, very little is known about 
residual neuromuscular blockade in patients following cardiac surgery. A recent large, 
retrospective study of a non -cardiac surgical database  has linked intermediate -acting 
neuromuscular blockade and postoperative pulmonary complica tions in a d ose-dependant manor . 
6 Patients undergoing cardiac surgery are even more susceptible to the detrimental effects of 
residual neuromuscular blockade  than in non -cardiac surgical patients, however  no recent clinical 
studies have b een directed at this populati on. The few studies that  have examined  NMB in 
cardiac surgical populations have served to shift routine practice away from older , long-acting 
NMB agents (e.g. pancuronium) toward the intermediate -acting agents (e.g. rocuronium or 
cisatracurium) commonly used during non -cardiac su rgery.12-16 Yet, cardiac surgical p atients 
experience physiologic conditions not associated with non -cardiac surgery, such as exposure to 
hypothermic cardiopulmonary bypass which is known to decrease muscle strength substantially 
 3 even in the absence of NMB.17,18 Additionally, the clinical effects of NMB may be intensified 
during hypothermia via complex pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions not yet 
fully understood. 19-24 Cardiac surgical patients may also be more susceptible to the harmful 
effects of residual neuromuscular blockade due to significant comorbidities pred isposing them to 
postoperative pulmonary complications.25-28  Concern over detrimental effects o f NMB have led 
some to call for minimizing or eliminating the  continuous use of NMB during cardiac surgery , as 
acceptable surgical conditions may be achieved with adequate depth of anesthesia and blunting of 
the physiologic response to surgery.29,30 Given the traditional  role of neuromusc ular blockade in 
the management of cardiac surgical patients, pro spective data is needed to determine the effect of 
NMB in cardiac surgical patients  as well as the surgical tolerability of protocols that minimize 
intraoperative paralysis . 
The proposed  prospective, randomiz ed trial will  assess the impact of neuromuscular  
blockade on early  (<72 hours post -ICU admission ) postoperative respiratory complications . This 
clinical study will prospectively investigate two groups of patients undergoing elective cardiac 
surgery at the Unive rsity of Chicago.  In the experimental  group, a very short -acting depolarizing 
NMB (succinylcholine) will be used for tracheal intubation  and no other subsequent  muscle 
relaxants t hroughout surgery.  In the control group , an intermediate -acting non -depolarizing 
NMB (cisatracurium) will be used thro ughout the intraoperative period (our standard practice)  
and will be re -administered to maintain a moderate to deep level of musc le relaxation until  the 
conclusion  of surgery .  Both groups will be monitored with peripheral nerve stimulators (ulnar 
and facial nerve) throughout the intraoperative period and immediate p ostoperative period. 
Residual neuromuscular blockade during the immediate postoperative period will be assessed in 
both groups  objectively and subjectively.  
 4 Recent clinical studies support the use of intraoperative acceleromyography for titration 
of NMB based on the motor response of nerve stimulation.31 Since during cardiac surgery, 
anesthesiologists have limited access to the patient ’s arms due to patient positioning, both the 
adductor pollicis and orbicularis oculi sites will be monitored with a TOF -Watch to provide for 
correlation as well as redundancy in the event of intraoperative disturb ance of the adductor 
pollicis site due to surgeon positioning.  
The primary outcome to be examined is  the composite event of a postoperative 
pulmonary complication  linked to resi dual NMB. Surgical tolerability  (assessed via specifically 
designed cardiac sur geon rating scale  and examination of undesired patient movement during 
anesthesia ) and subjective/objective signs of postoperative weakness (patient questionnaire, 
neuromuscular blockade monitoring)  are the secondary outcomes to be assessed . 
 
Methods 
 A prospective, randomized protocol was de signed to assess the impact of  low/single dose NMB 
on the incidence of early respiratory  complications in cardiac surgery.  Reported incidence of 
respiratory complications after cardiac surgery range s from 0.5 -30% depending upon the 
particular complication  and population subset  being examined. The current study focuses on a 
pre-defined composite measure of respiratory complica tions that are  potential sequelae of NMB -
associated effects on respiratory muscle weakness.  This primary outcome measure will include 
the following  and will be determined through prospective observation  for 72 hours following 
admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) postoperatively .  (See “Data Collection: Respiratory 
Complications”)  
1. Failure to extubate within 24 hours of ICU admission  time 
 Determined via documentation of extubation time  
 5 2. Need for tracheal r e-intubation  (<72 hours post-ICU admission ) 
 Determined via documentation of  respiratory therapy /intubation events  
3. Pneumonia  
 Defined by radiologist report  or ICU attending assessment  of new or progressive 
pulmonary infiltrate on chest x -ray AND 
 Clinical findings suggesting systemic infection (fever >38 °C or <36°C OR WBC 
count >12,000/mm3 or <4,000/mm3) OR antibiotic therapy OR positive respiratory 
cultures/purulent sputum  
4. Pulmonary a spiration 
 Diffuse infiltrates or consolidation of dependant lung segments on chest x -ray 
consistent with aspiration  
  AND clinical findings consistent with aspiration pneumonitis, including 
increasing oxygen requirements, suspected aspiration or increased work of 
breathing  
5. Need for noninvasive respiratory support  with CPAP or BiPAP therapy  
 Documented use required during first 72 hours post -ICU admission  
 Composite scoring of respiratory events does not include c ontinuation of CPAP 
therapy as prescribed preoperatively for known obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)  
 Includes escalation of therapy (BiPAP treatment when previously CPAP only was 
needed) 
6. ARDS (mild, moderate or severe)  (<72 hours post-ICU admissio n) based on Berlin 
definition : 
 Bilateral opacities on chest x -ray consistent with pulmonary edema  
 Arterial blood gas and ventilator setting evidence of PAO2/FiO2 ratio <300 
 6  Not fully explained by cardiac failure or fluid overload  
7. Mortality attributed to respiratory event ( <72 hours post -ICU admission)  
 Hypoxic or hypercarbic respiratory arrest  
Secondary outcomes in the study will be:  
1. Surgical Tolerability  
 Measured by a designed instrument that will be completed by the surgeon and 
anesthesia staff and will  include reporting of the following  (See “Data 
Collection: Surgical Tolerability ”) 
o Patient movement: Major (limb movement, coughing on ventilat or), 
minor (diaphragm movement) , none 
o Movement interfering with surgical progress: Yes, no  
o Surgical conditions: E xcellent, good, poor  
o Total dose supplemental propofol required for suppression of 
movements  
o BIS recorded during patient movement  
2. Weakness  (See “Data Collection: Postoperative”)  
 Blinded assessment of p atient experience of  weakness  or respiratory 
difficulties on postoperative survey  (See “Postoperative Survey”)  
Study Risk and Benefits  
When continuous muscle relaxation is omitted, there is a risk of movement under 
anesthesia (e.g. coughing, limb muscle movement), which may interfere with surgery. Movement 
under anesthesia occurs occasionally even when muscle relaxation is provided contin uously 
(during standard of care), but in the absence of muscle relaxation (non -standard of care), these 
movements may be more pronounced. Other anesthesia medications (i.e. anesthetic agents, 
 7 analgesic agents) are provided when muscle relaxation is not bei ng administered to minimize 
these risks. In our study, midazolam and fentanyl (standard of care medications) will be 
administered in doses to avoid the potential for inadvertent movement. In the low dose muscle 
relaxant group, inadvertent patient movement will be treated with additional anesthesia with 
propofol, increasing the dose of volatile anesthetic, administering pain medication or if necessary 
for patient safety, administering muscle relaxants as required (i.e. reverting to standard of care). 
The risk of movement under anesthesia when low dose muscle relaxant is used is reasonable 
because providing anesthesia without muscle relaxation is an established technique used for other 
types of surgery (e.g. n on cardiac).  
As muscle relaxation has been associat ed with harmful effects (e.g. postoperative 
pulmonary complications), the use of low doses ha s some potential benefit . Results from this 
study may help future patients having cardiac surgery by providing guidance to the best way to 
conduct anesthesia to mi nimize respiratory complications.  
Monitoring of Safety  
There will be ongoing (case by case) review of adverse events and safety information 
between the principal investigator and co -investigators and any events will be addressed. 
Unanticipated problems req uiring a revision to the protocol will be sub mitted to the IRB for 
review. A Data Safety Monitoring Board has been convened and will review the results early in 
the study as well as halfway through enrolment to address any safety concerns. A continuing 
review with examination of preliminary data will be conducted after 50 patients have been 
recruited. 
Unanticipated problems (i.e. unexpected events that are related or possibly related to 
participation in the research that suggest that the research places sub jects or others at risk of 
unknown harm or increased frequency of harm) will be reported to the IRB within 10 working 
 8 days of the investigator’s knowledge of the event. In the event of a fatal or life -threatening 
unanticipated problem, enrolment will be ha lted and the IRB chair notified by phone 
immediately. A major deviation from the protocol will be reported within 10 working days via 
the “Unanticipated Problem” form. A minor deviation will be summarized at the time of 
continuing review on the “Continuing  Review Form”.  
Power Calculation:  
Previous studies of respiratory complications after cardiac surgery have suggeste d 
incidence rates ranging from 0.5 -30%.26,27,33-35 Many of the se studies include  atelectasis and 
pleural effusions in their composite calculation of respiratory complications , which are 
problematic because of diagnostic difficulty and less clear relati onship to NMB use. The current  
study will focus solely on the respiratory complication s previously defined. Assuming  this 
composite  has a potential incidence of 20% and that the effect size  is 0.5, a total of 47  patients 
will be required in each arm to achieve a pow er of 80% with a p=0.05. A total of 100 patients 
will be recruited  to account for crossover .  
Inclusion Criteria  
All patients >18  years old undergoing elective cardiac surgery  (coronary artery bypass 
grafting [CABG], valve replacement or CABG + valve repla cement) requiring cardiopulmonary 
bypass at the University of Chic ago with one of two  surgeons (Dr. Jeevanandam  or Dr. Ota ). 
Exclusion criteria 
Emergency surgery, extremes of age (<18 or >90 years), previous cardiac surgery, clinical 
contraindications to succinylcholine or cisatracurium, anticipated difficult tracheal intubation, 
preoperative mechanical ventilation, preoperative pharmacologic/mech anical hemodynamic 
support. 
Study Protocol  
 9  Institutional Review Board approval will be obtained and the study will be registered 
with www.clinicaltria ls.gov prior to commencement.  All patients enrolled in the  study will be 
randomized to either a standard protocol (Group CIS) or the single -dose NMB protocol (Group 
SUX) (See “Intraoperative Protocol”).  All study and anesthetic drugs will be administered by the 
anesthesia care team. The neuromuscular blocking agents being studied will be dispensed by the 
operating room pharmacy, as is routine, and drawn up in the operating room for intravenous 
administration.  ICU providers and surgeons will be blinded to the study group assignment, and 
intraoperative and postop erative care will otherwise be routine.  
No compensation will be provided to study participants. Patients will be identified by 
review of operative room schedules and consent will occur prior to the standard preoperative 
interview. The data set created from  study information will be maintained following study 
completion but all patient identifiers will be deleted. This will be maintained for a minimum of 6 
years. Consent forms with patient identifying information will be held in a locked file in a locked 
office for a minimum of 6 years. Randomization will  be performed by computer generation . Data 
analysis will be performed on an intention to treat basis.

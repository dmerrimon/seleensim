 Protocol Body  
 
1.0 Objectives  
Primary endpoint:  
 
1. To determine the progression -free survival (PFS) in patients with refractory or 
relapsed myeloma receiving panobinostat/gemcitabine/busulfan/melphalan 
(panobinostat/Gem/Bu/Mel) with autologous stem -cell transplant, either as a first or 
a salvage stem -cell transplant.  
 
Secondary endpoints:  
 
1. To evaluate the complete response (CR)  rate. 
2. To determine the overall survival  (OS).  
3. To determine the CR + very good partial remission (VGPR)  rate. 
4. To determine the overall response rate  (ORR).  
5. To determine  minimal  residual  disease  posttransplant,  measured  by 
multiparametric  flow cytometry  (MFC).  
6. To describe the toxicity profile of  panobinostat/Gem/Bu/Mel.  
7. To analyze  the predictive  value  of pretransplant  levels  in myeloma  cells of XBP1,  
IRE1, XBP1u, XPB1s, XBP1u/XPBs ratio and Myc, by analyzing their correlation 
with CR, VGPR+CR and  RR. 
8. To study the prognostic effect of pretransplant levels in myeloma cells of XBP1, 
IRE1, XBP1u,  XPB1s,  XBP1u/ XPBs  ratio and Myc,  by analyzing  their correlation  
with PFS and OS.  
 
 
2.0 Background  
2.1. Current Status and Shortcomings of High -Dose Chemotherapy for  Myeloma  
 
High-dose chemotherapy (HDC) with autologous stem -cell transplant (ASCT) support 
results in signific ant benefit as part of first -line treatment of myeloma.[1, 2] However, most 
patients eventually experience tumor relapse after HDC. In addition, high -dose melphalan 
induces only 5 -10% of CR with a median PFS of around 12 months in patients with 
primary ref ractory disease or in refractory relapse.[3 -5] These data underscore the need to 
develop more active HDC regimens. While maintenance post -transplant treatment with 
lenalidomide or bortezomib improves PFS,[7 -9] it is likely that ultimate success of 
maintena nce strategies, i.e., long -term OS  benefit,  will still largely  depend  on the depth  of 
response  previously  achieved  by HDC.  Thus, further exploration of novel preparative 
regimens for single transplantations is necessary with the short -term goal of improving CR  
rate. 
 
Complete response is a major surrogate for long -term OS in myeloma. Achievement of a 
CR with HDC is a crucial step for long -lasting PFS and OS.[10, 11] This seems particularly 
critical in refractory or high -risk disease, whereas it may be less important in more 
smoldering tumors, who can still enjoy prolonged outcomes despite never achieving a 
CR.[12]  
 
2014 -0516  Version 16                                            2 5 February 2020  Page 4 of 42 
 
  
Multiparametric flow cytometry (MFC) of bone marrow exam to define immunophenotypic 
CR has gained  acceptance  in myeloma.  This technique  presents  a sensitivity  of 10-4 to 10-5, 
superior to that of immunofluorescence or immunohistochemistry, and broader 
applicability than PCR.[13] Minimal residual disease (MRD) status by MFC at day 100 
post-transplant has been  shown to be a major prognostic factor after front -line HDC.[14]  
 
2.2. Gemcitabine/Busulfan/Melphalan  
 
As with most other tumors in which HDC plays a role, it is conceivable that an active drug 
combination will prove to be more effective than the current standard of single -agent 
melphalan. We  have developed a combination of infusional gemcitabine, busulfan and 
melphalan (Gem/Bu/Mel), following these principles:  
 
1. Synergy  between  gemcitabine  and alkylators,  based  on inhibition  of DNA  
damage repair.[15]  
2. Gemcitabine  infusions  at FDR of 10 mg/m2/min  avoid  saturation  of its intracellular  
metabolic activation, which results in improved antitumor activity and increased 
myelotoxicity compared to shorter infusions.[16] The increased myelotoxicity of FDR 
infusions is overcome by stem -cell support.  
3. Minimal overlapping dose -limiting toxicity of the three agents at high  doses.  
4. Optimization of intravenous busulfan therapy by therapeutic drug  monitoring.[17]  
 
In our phase 1 trial of this combination (MDA 2006 -0803) we saw early signals of high 
activity in 7 patients with refractory myeloma enrolled in the trial.[18] Five of them had 
primary refractory disease and 2 had refractory relapse, all pretreated with a median 4 
prior regimens. Their disease status at transplant was progressive disease in 5 patien ts 
and stable disease or partial response in the remaining 2 patients. In this very poor 
prognosis small subgroup, 6 patients achieved a response, which met criteria for stringent 
CR in 3 of them. Three of these patients remain free of progression at more than 5 years.  
 
These observations led us to test Gem/Bu/Mel in a phase 2 trial in refractory/relapsed 
myeloma (MDA 2010 -0506).[19] The primary endpoint was the CR rate, targeting a 20% 
CR rate, which was deemed to be clinically relevant in this population where single agent 
high-dose melphalan is expected to induce 10% or less CRs. We enrolled 74 patients, 
median age 45 (22 -68), who had received a median prior 4 lines of therapy (range, 2 -13). 
Sixteen patients had myeloma unresponsive to all prior treatment s; 32 patients had failed 
prior HDC; 27 patients had high -risk cytogenetics. Disease status at HDC was CR (N=9), 
PR (N=38) and no response (N=27, including tumor progression in 20). The CR rate was 
24.6%, with 77.5% response rate. At median follow -up of 22  months (6 -46), the PFS and 
OS rates are 45% and 69%, respectively. Among the 32 patients receiving Gem/Bu/Mel 
as a second salvage transplant, the median PFS was 21 months with 1 -year PFS rate of 
59%, seemingly superior to our previously published experien ce with salvage 
transplants.[17] There were 3 treatment -related deaths (1 pneumonia, 1 sudden cardiac 
arrest of undetermined etiology with normal postmortem exam findings, and 1 E coli 
neutropenic sepsis). The toxicity profile included mucositis (49% grade  2, 20% grade 3), 
dermatitis (20% grade 2, 7% grade 3), asymptomatic transaminase elevations (17% grade 
2, 7% grade 3) and asymptomatic bilirubin elevations (3% grade2, 10% grade 3), with no 
cases of  venoocclusive disease. There were no renal, cardiac, neu rological or pulmonary 
toxicities.

2.3. Potentiation of Gem/Bu/Mel through Histone Deacetylase  Inhibition  
 
A major factor affecting the activity of alkylating agents is their access to DNA, which 
largely depends on the configuration of chromatin. Acetylation of lysine residues in the 
histones leads to charge neutralization, decreased binding to the DNA backbone, 
changes in the conformation of DNA and gene expression, and relaxation of chromatin. 
Histone acetyltransferases (HAT) and histone deacetylases (HDACs)  add and remove 
acetyl groups, respectively. Addition of  
acetyl groups by HATs or inhibition of HDACs results in the weakening of the bond 
between histones and DNA, increasing gene transcription and decondensing 
chromatin.  
 
Histone deacetylase inhibitors ( HDACi) induce relaxation of the chromatin, rendering the 
DNA more accessible to DNA -targeting agents such as alkylators and nucleoside 
analogues. To this end we combined the first -generation HDACi vorinostat with 
Gem/Bu/Mel. Our preclinical experiments sho wed marked synergy when vorinostat was 
added to GemBuMel, as determined by apoptosis or survival readouts in lymphoma B -cell 
and T -cell (J45) lines, which were resistant to those agents when exposed to them 
separately.[18]

In these experiments lymphoma cells exposed to 
vorinostat/gemcitabine/busulfan/melphalan experienced increased cleavage of PARP1 
and increase in gamma -H2AX, reflecting increased DNA damage (Fig. 2)

These observations led to our clinical trial 20 11-0407, evaluating a short schedule of 
vorinostat concurrent with GemBuMel with autologous stem cell support.[19] We 
combined GemBuMel at full doses with escalated doses of vorinostat from 200 mg daily to 
the maximally planned dose of 1,000 mg daily with good tolerance and no dose -limiting 
toxicities. There was no QT prolongation after treatment. The toxicity profile of 
vorinostat/Gem/Bu/Mel was comparable to that of Gem/Bu/Mel alone. The regimen was 
highly active across all lymphoma histologies.  
 
2.4. Use of H DACi in  Myeloma.  
 
Clinical trials have shown the safety and increased activity of combinations of HDACi with 
other agents.[20 -22] Bortezomib/vorinostat resulted in a small prolongation of PFS 
compared to bortezomib alone (7.6 vs. 6.8 months, P=0.01) in pat ients with 
relapsed/refractory myeloma.[23] A larger benefit was observed with the use of 
panobinostat, which is substantially more potent than vorinostat. In a phase 2 trial in 
patients with relapsed and bortezomib -refractory MM, the combination of panobi nostat with 
bortezomib and dexamethasone was able to recapture responses in 35% of patients.[24]. 
In a subsequent phase III randomized trial the combination of 
panobinostat/bortezomib/dexamethasone was compared to bortezomib/dexamethasone in 
relapsed/refra ctory disease.[25] The addition of panobinostat resulted in a significant 
improvement in median PFS of 12.0 months vs. 8.1 months (hazard ratio 0.63, P< 0.0001), 
CR/near CR rate (27.6% vs. 15.7%, respectively; p = 0.00006), duration of response, time 
to response and median time to progression (12.7 vs. 8.5 months). The addition of 
panobinostat was associated with an increased frequency of thrombocytopenia (grade 3/4 
in 67% vs. 31% of patients). Other grade 3/4 adverse events occurring more frequently in 
the panobinostat arm included lymphopenia (53% vs. 40%), neutropenia (34% vs. 11%), 
diarrhea (25% vs. 8%), and asthenia/fatigue (24% vs. 12%). However, these adverse 
events led to discontinuation in fewer than 5% of patients in the panobinostat arm.

On 02/23 /2015 the FDA granted approval for panobinostat for patients with relapsed or refractor 
myeloma treated with at least two prior standard therapies, including bortezomib and an 
immunomodulatory agent. This is precisely the target population of this transpla nt study.  
 
2.5. STUDY  RATIONALE/PURPOSE  
 
We wish to develop an effective high -dose regimen for refractory myeloma, building on 
our prior experience with SAHA/Gem/Bu/Mel, substituting panobinostat for SAHA. 
Panobinostat is a more effective drug for myeloma than vorinostat. Its toxicity profile 
suggests, as with vorinostat, the feasibility of its combination with Gem/Bu/Mel.  
 
We hypothesize that epigenetic modulation of Gem/Bu/Mel with panobinostat is feasible 
and will increase the activity of the regimen. To faci litate the addition of panobinostat we 
will decrease the dose of gemcitabine in Gem/Bu/Mel compared to the regimen we tested 
in the phase 2 trial.  
 
We will study the prognostic and predictive effect of study markers of unfolded protein 
response (UPR) in pa tients enrolled in this trial. As highly secretory immunoglobulin -
producing cells, myeloma cells require an increased capacity to handle unfolded proteins 
within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) under conditions of stress. The UPR includes 
transmembrane ER p roteins, such as IRE1, which has RNase activity and removes an 
intron from the XBP1 mRNA. The spliced XBP1 protein (XPB1s) is a potent transcription 
factor that controls genes involved in ER membrane biosynthesis, protein import, 
chaperoning and ER -associa ted degradation of unfolded proteins. Myeloma cells are 
prone to ER stress and have a highly active UPR.  
 
We will study panobinostat/GemBuMel in two separate cohorts of patients receiving a first or a 
salvage stem -cell transplant.

Oral panobinostat will be supplied as 20 -mg capsules. During the study, panobinostat  will 
be administered orally as once daily dose of 20 mg. Each dose of panobinostat should be 
taken with an 8 oz. / 240 ml glass of water. Patients should be instructed to swallow the 
capsules whole and not chew them. Patients must avoid grapefruit or grap efruit juice and 
seville (sour) oranges during the entire study.  
 
On days when panobinostat is to be administered with other drugs it will be administered 
within 1 hour before the next drug. Repeat a full dose if emesis occurs within 30 minutes 
and tablets /tablet fragments are found in the vomit. The time of administration will be in 
the early morning, and the patient may need to be woken up by the nurse. The nurse 
must stay and witness the patient taking the drug.  
 
Gemcitabine will be administered as a loa ding dose of 75 mg/m2 followed by continuous 
infusion of the remaining dose at 10mg/m2/minute. It will be followed immediately by 
busulfan on Day -8 and melphalan on Day -3. 
 
Busulfan test dose will be administered as an outpatient any day within 1 week of Day -12. 
If given as an inpatient, the test dose will be administered on Day -10. The busulfan test 
dose of 32 mg/m2 will be based on actual body weight to be administered over 60 
minutes. Busulfan pharmacokinetics will be done with the test dose a nd repeated with the 
first therapeutic dose on day -8. The doses of days -6 and -5 will be subsequently adjusted 
to target an AUC of 4,000  
microMol.min . In the event that PK adjusting was not possible a dose of busulfan of 100 
mg/m2 will be administered on  days -6 and -5. 
 
Melphalan will be administered at 60 mg/m2 on Days -3 and -2. 
 
6.3 Supportive  Treatment  
Patients will receive standard supportive treatment as outlined below.  
 
1. Dexamethasone 8 mg IV BID from day -9 PM to day -2 PM. Omit any 
other dexamethason e for chemotherapy  premedication.

2014 -0516  Version 16                                            2 5 February 2020  Page 14 of 42 
 
 cm) increase  as measured  by the sum of the products  of the cross -diameters  of the 
measurable lesion.  
3. Hypercalcemia (> 11.5  mg/dL).

5. After two years of treatment  completion.  
 
10.0 Determination of Body Surface Area  
For pa tients whose actual body weight is < 20% above ideal body weight (defined by the 
MD Anderson dosing calculator), the actual body weight is used to calculate the body 
surface area (BSA). The actual body weight will also be used to calculate the BSA for the 
busulfan test dose. For  purposes  of gemcitabine  and melphalan  dosing,  patients  whose  
actual  body  weight  is >20% above ideal body weight, an “adjusted body weight” is 
calculated using the midpoint between the actual and ideal body weight, and defining that 
as the adjusted body weight. That ad justed body weight is then used to calculate an 
“adjusted body surface area” that is used for chemotherapy dosing calculation  purposes.  
11.0 Reporting  Requirements  
Patients will be monitored for toxicity until day +100 or until documentation of reversal of 
toxicities related to this treatment. The intensity of adverse events (AE) will be assessed 
according to the Common Terminology Criteria v4.0 (CTCAE). Adverse events and 
protocol deviations will be reported accordingly to MDACC policy and procedures. 
Collectio n of adverse events will reflect the onset and resolution date and maximum 
grade. Intermittent events should be labeled as such and followed until resolution. If a 
patient is taken off study while an event is still ongoing, this will be followed until reso lution 
unless another therapy is initiated. Pre -existing medical conditions will be recorded only if 
an exacerbation occurs during the active treatment period. Co -morbid events will not be 
scored separately.  
 
 
 
 
2014 -0516  Version 16                                            2 5 February 2020  Page 15 of 42 
 
 11.1 Adverse events (toxicities) known to be produced by the chemotherapy  regimen:  
 
Gastrointestinal: Diarrhea (FDA boxed warning), nausea and vomiting, oral mucositis 
Hepatic: Self -limited elevations of liver function enzymes; veno -occlusive disease 
Hypersensitivity: Acute hypersensitivity reactions  characterized by urticaria, pruritus, 
edema, and in some patients, tachycardia, hypotension and bronchospasm (rare)  
Pulmonary: Pulmonary fibrosis and interstitial 
pneumonitis. Skin: Rash.  
Endocrine abnormalities: Hypothyroidism.  
Cardiac abnormalities: QTc  prolongation, arrhythmias.  
 
11.2. Adverse events (toxicities) known to be produced by other treatment components:  
 
The following events are not considered to be significant in relationship with the study 
treatment,  will not be considered  adverse  events  and will not be collected  in the study  
database.  
 
Myelosuppression -related: neutropenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, platelet and RBC 
transfusions.  
Flu-like symptoms: low grade fever, headache, chills, cough, rhinitis, myalgia, fatigue, 
sweating and insomnia.  
Mood alteration: depression, anxiety, and agitation 
Readmissions (lasting <10 days)  
Low blood pressure due to dehydration requiring fluid 
replacement Fluid overload.  
Fatigue.  
Laboratory serum metabolic values not reflecting end -organ (hepatic, renal) function 
and or those considered associated to the original disease  
Events that are identified to be related to the supportive treatment, e.g., 
steroids, palifermin, antibiotics.  
 
11.3 Adverse Events Considered Serious (SAEs):  
 
1. Graft  failure/rejection  
2. Prolonged  hospitalization  due to infections  and/or  organ  failure  requiring  
extensive supportive care (i.e. dialysis, mechanical  ventilation)  
3. Readmissions from any cause resulting in a prolonged hospitalization (>10  days).  
4. Any expected  or unexpected  event  resul ting in an irreversible  condition  and/ or 
leading  to death.  
 
Serious adverse events (SAE) will be reported to the PI or his designate, who in turn will 
notify the IRB following institutional policy.  
 
11.4.  Secura  Bioinstructions  for rapid notification of serious adverse  events:  
This is an investigator -initiated study sponsored by Secura Bio . The principal investigator 
has the obligation to report all serious adverse events to Secura Bio . This includes serious, 
related, labeled (expected) and serious, related, unlabeled (unexpected) adverse 
experiences. All deaths during treatment or within 30 days following completion of active 
protocol therapy must be reported within 24 hours.  
Any serious adverse event occurring after the patie nt has provided informed consent and 
2014 -0516  Version 16                                            2 5 February 2020  Page 16 of 42 
 
 until 4 weeks after the patient has stopped study participation must be reported. This 
includes the period  in which the study protocol interferes with the standard medical treatment 
given to a patient (e.g. treatment wi thdrawal during washout period, change in treatment to a 
fixed dose of concomitant medication).  
Serious adverse events occurring more than 4 weeks after study discontinuation need only be 
reported if a relationship to the Novartis study drug (or therapy) i s suspected.  
 
11.5.  Protocol amendments or changes in study  conduct  
Any change or addition (excluding administrative) to this protocol requires a written protocol 
amendment that must be reviewed by Novartis and the investigator before implementation. 
Amendments significantly affecting the safety of subjects, the scope of the investigation or 
the scientific quality of the study require additional approval by the IRB at each study center. 
A  copy of the written approval of the IRB must be provided to Novartis. Exam ples of 
amendments requiring such approval  are: 
1. Increases in drug dose or duration of exposure of  subjects,  
2. Significant changes in the study design (e.g. addition or deletion of a control  group),  
3. Increases in the number of invasive  procedures,  
4. Addition or deletions of a test procedure required for monitoring of  safety.  
These requirements for approval should in no way prevent any immediate action from 
being taken by the investigator or by Novartis in the interests of preserving the safety of all 
patients inc luded in the trial. If an immediate change to the protocol is felt to be necessary 
by the investigator and is implemented for safety reasons Novartis must be notified and 
the IRB at the center must be informed immediately.  
 
 
12.0 Correlative Studies  
These correlative studies will be optional for patients participating in this trial. We will 
measure by RT -PCR the pretransplant levels of the following markers of UPR in myeloma 
cells extracted from a bone marrow aspirate: XBP1, IRE1, XBP1u, XPB1s, and My c. 
Myeloma cells will be purified as described and cryopreserved until analysis.[27]  
 
1. We will study  the prognostic  effect  of pretransplant  levels  in myeloma  cells of XBP1,  
IRE1, XBP1u, XPB1s, XBP1u/XPBs ratio and Myc, by analyzing their correlation 
with PF S and OS.  
 
2. We will determine the predictive value of pretransplant levels in myeloma cells of 
XBP1, IRE1,  XBP1u,  XPB1s,  XBP1u/XPBs  ratio and Myc,  by analyzing  their 
correlation  with CR, VGPR+CR and  RR. 
 
Correlative studies will be conducted in the laborato ry of Ben Valdez, Ph.D. at MD Anderson.

 13.0 Statistical Considerations  
Overview:  
 
This is a Phase II clinical trial examining the effect of panobinostat  + Gemcitabine/Busulfan/ 
Melphalan (Gem/Bu/Mel) with hematopoietic cell support in patients with refractory or relapsed 
myeloma. There will be two parallel cohorts: 1) patients with refractory disease receiving their  
first transplant, and 2) patients recei ving a second salvage transplant. We expect to enroll 40 
patients in each cohort and a total of 80 patients in the study. The primary objective in each 
cohort is to assess whether progression -free survival (PFS) can be improved over historical 
patients tre ated with Gem/Bu/Mel. Secondary objectives include assessing overall survival, 
response rates, toxicity, and various biomarkers. Study endpoints will only be assessed among 
patients who have received the study treatment.  
 
Primary Endpoint  
 
Progression -free survival. 
Secondary Endpoints  
1. Complete response (CR)  rate 
2. Overall survival  (OS)  
3. CR + very good partial remission (VGPR)  rate 
4. Response rate  (RR)  
5. Minimal residual disease post -transplant measured by multiparametric flow  cytometry  
6. To describe  the toxicity  profile  
7. To analyze  the predictive  value  of pretransplant  levels  in myeloma  cells of XBP1,  
IRE1, XBP1u, XPB1s, XBP1u/XPBs ratio and Myc, by analyzing their correlation 
with CR, VGPR+CR and  RR. 
8. To study the prognostic effect of pretransplant le vels in myeloma cells of XBP1, 
IRE1, XBP1u,  XPB1s,  XBP1u/XPBs  ratio and Myc,  by analyzing  their correlation  
with PFS and OS.  
 
Sample Size and Power  
The 1 -year PFS rate in cohort 1 (refractory, 1st transplant) associated with GemBuMel  is 
62%. With 40 patients in this cohort, assuming exponentially -distributed PFS times, 1.5 
years of accrual followed by 2 years of follow -up, and a one -sided 5% Type I error rate, 40 
patients provides more than 80% power to detect an increase in one -year PFS to 75% in 
this cohort.  
 
In cohort 2 (2nd transplant), the historical 1 -year PFS rate is 55%. Under the same 
assumptions, 40 patients will provide more than 80% power to detect an increase in 1 -
year PFS to 69%.  
 
Patients lost to follow -up before 1 year will be censored at the time of their last follow -
up.  
 
Safety Monitoring Endpoints  
To ensure patient safety in this trial, we will monitor the rate of treatment -related mortality 
(TRM). We target a maximum TRM rate of no more than 5%. The method of Thall et al 
will be employed to perform interim safety monitoring.[28].  
2014 -0516  Version 16                                            2 5 February 2020  Page 18 of 42 
 
 During the treatment administration and until day +100 all patients will be monitored for 
toxicity, specifically for grade 3 or greater side effects, according to CTCAE v4.0. 
Response will b e assessed by day +100 using the International Myeloma Working Group 
(IMWG) uniform response criteria.  
 
Safety Monitoring Rule  
To monitor the treatment -related mortality (TRM) rate, a binary outcome, there are two 
possible elementary outcomes. They are 1 =  [treatment -related death], 2 = [alive or death 
due to other causes]. We denote the probability vector with the experimental treatment by 
qE.  We assume a Beta (0.1, 1.9) prior on qE, which corresponds to a mean TRM rate of 
5%. Because we expect  the TRM  rate not to differ  between  the two cohorts  of patients,  
this monitoring  rule will be applied overall rather than by  cohort.  
 
The following decision criteria will be applied after a minimum of 2 patients has been 
evaluated, up to the last patient. Targeting a  5% TRM rate as a trade -off, the trial will be 
stopped early if:  
 
Pr[qE(TRM rate) > 5% | data] > 0.975  
 
That is, if at any time during the trial we determine that we have greater than 97.5% posterior 
probability that the TRM rate is higher than 5%, we will  stop enrollment into the trial. Stopping 
boundaries corresponding to this probability criterion are found in the following table.

 This stopping  rule was simulated  using  the program  Multc  Lean  Desktop  version  2.1.0,  
available from the MDACC Department of Biostatistics. This leads to the operating 
characteristics found in the table  below.

Secondary Analyses  
 
Summary statistics will be provided for continuous variables. Frequency tables will be 
used to summarize categorical variables. Response rates (CR; CR/VGPR; RR) will be 
reported along with corresponding 95% confidence intervals. Logistic regression will be 
used to model the association between response rates and prognostic factors. Overall 
survival (OS) and progression free survival (PFS) will be esti mated by the Kaplan -Meier 
method. Comparison of time to event endpoints by subgroups will be made using the log -
rank test. Cox proportional hazards regression will be employed for univariate and 
multivariate analysis on time -to-event outcomes. The treatmen t-related morality rate will 
be computed and presented with 95% confidence interval. Adverse events will be 
tabulated for all patients.  
 
We will analyze the correlation with PS and OS of pretransplant levels in myeloma cells of 
XBP1, IRE1, XBP1u, XPB1s, XB P1u/XPBs ratio and Myc, using the log -rank test. We will 
analyze the correlation with CR, VGPR+CR and RR of pretransplant levels in myeloma 
cells of XBP1, IRE1, XBP1u, XPB1s, XBP1u/XPBs ratio and Myc, using Fisher’s F test.  
 
14.0 Background Drug Informatio n 
14.1.  Panobinostat  
 
Panobinostat is a HDACi belonging to a structurally novel cinnamic hydroxamic acid class 
of compounds. It is a potent class I/II pan -HDACi  with anti -tumor activity in pre -clinical 
models and cancer patients. Deacetylases (DAC) target lysine groups on chromatin and 
transcription factors and various non -histone proteins such as p53, tubulin, HSP90 and Rb. 
Panobinostat is formulated as an oral capsule.  
 
Clinical development of panobinostat focuses on the oral formulation. The clinical 
program for the i.v. formulation is completed with no further company -sponsored studies 
currently planned. As of 31 December 2013, 36 clinical studies, including c linical 
pharmacology, phase I and phase II trials, as well as two randomized phase III studies 
have either been completed or are ongoing. A total of 2428 patients were enrolled, 235 
for i.v. and 2193 for oral, who received at least one dose of panobinostat  either as a 
single agent or in combination with other agents.  
2014 -0516  Version 16                                            2 5 February 2020  Page 20 of 42 
 
  
Patients were treated with panobinostat either TIW QW (666 patients) or TIW QOW (96 
patients) in single agent trials. These patients comprise the pooled safety population 
experiencing adverse (AE) events during study treatment. The most frequent non -
hematologic AE included gastrointestinal events (diarrhea, nausea, vomiting), mostly of 
grade 1 -2, in bot h  groups. Blood and lymphatic system disorders were the second most 
often reported specific system organ class, with dose -related thrombocytopenia being the 
most frequent AE. Fatigue, mostly grade 1 -2, was also common among patients treated 
for TIW QW and TIW QOW. Thyroid function, as monitored by the measurement of TSH 
and free T4, did not revea l overt hyper - or hypothyroidism, with fluctuations in TSH values 
being within normal limits.

 A patient with multiple 
occurrences of an AE is 
counted only once in  that AE 
category.  
A patient with multiple 
adverse events within a 
primary system organ class 
is counted only once in the 
total row.  
If an AE frequency matches 
the criteria in one dose 
category, the frequency of 
that event is shown for all 
doses.  
Primary s ystem organ 
classes are presented 
alphabetically; preferred 
terms are sorted within 
primary system organ class 
alphabetically.  
 
As shown above, AEs regardless of causality for TIW QW dosing were reported in 664 
patients, 99.7% of the safety population for this dosing schedule. The most commonly 
reported AEs across doses were gastrointestinal: diarrhea in 406 patients (61.0%) and 
nausea in 372 patients (55.9%). Thrombocytopenia was the third most frequent AE in 359 
patients (53.9%) with the hi ghest frequency in the 40 mg dose level (137 patients; 84%). 
Fatigue also was commonly seen across dose levels in 326 patients (48.9%) overall. Of 
note hypothyroidism was reported in 12.9% of patients treated at the dose level of 40 mg, 
mostly deriving fro m study [CLBH589E2214] in HL patients who are known to have an 
increased risk for hypothyroidism.

in one dose category, the frequency of 
that event is shown for all doses.       
 
 
As shown above, grade 3 -4 AEs regardless of causality were reported in 534 patients, 
80.2% of the safety population for the QW schedule. The most commonly reported 
grade 3 -4 AEs across doses were thrombocytopenia in 272 patients (40.8%), 
neutropenia in111 patients (16.7%), anemia in 103 patients (15.5%), fatigue in 82 
patients (12.3%) and febrile neutropenia in 46 patients (6.9%). There were more grade 
3-4 hematologic AEs at higher dose levels, with the highest incidences at 40 and 60 mg. 
The highest incide nce of febrile neutropenia was seen at the dose level of 60 mg 
(27.4%) compared to the other dose levels where the incidence was  3.7%. This could 
be because this dose level was only tested in leukemia patients, in whom febrile 
neutropenia is a common AE.  Grade 3 -4 thrombocytopenia, grade 3 -4 neutropenia and 
grade 3 -4 anemia accounted for 75.7% (272/359), 82.8% (111/134) and 52.8% 
(103/195) of their respective all grade events.  
Grade3 -4 diarrhea, grade 3 -4 vomiting and grade 3 -4 nausea accounted for less t han 
10% of their respective all grade events. For the TIW QOW dosing schedule, AEs 
regardless of causality were reported in 96 patients, which is 100% of the safety 
population. The most commonly reported AEs (all grades) across doses were diarrhea in 
65 pa tients (67.7%), nausea in 60 patients (62.5%), fatigue in 54 patients (56.3%), 
vomiting in 42 patients (43.8%),  thrombocytopenia in 41 patients (42.7%), pyrexia in 35 
patients (36.5%) and anorexia in 33  patients (34.4%).  
 
In the TIWQOW schedule, Grade 3 -4 AEs regardless of causality were reported in 81

 patients, 84.4% of the safety population. The most commonly reported Grade 3 -4 AEs 
across doses were thrombocytopenia in 35 patients (36.5%), neutropenia in 25 patients 
(26.0%), fatigue in  
14 patients (14.6%) , diarrhea in 11 patients (11.5%), anemia in 10 patients (10.4%), 
and febrile neutropenia in 8 patients each (8.3%).  
 
Overall, the most frequent Grade 3 -4 AEs regardless of causality for both schedules 
(TIWQW and TIWQOW) were ascribed to the same SOC, name ly blood and lymphatic 
system disorders.  
 
FDA boxed warning for Panobinostat : 
a. Warning : Fatal and Serious Toxicities: Severe Diarrhea and Cardiac  Toxicities  
b. Severe diarrhea occurred in 25% of panobinostat treated  patients . 
c. Severe and fatal cardiac ischemic events, severe arrhythmias, and ECG changes 
have occurred  in patients  receiving  panotbinostat . Arrhythmias  may be exacerbated  by 
electrolyte abnormalities  
 
Human pharmacokinetics  
After oral administration, panobinostat is rapidly absorbed with no observed lag phase. 
Maximum plasma concentrations were generally reached within 1 hour after oral dosing. 
The absolute bioavailability was 30% and the mean (SD) half -life of panobinostat was 
comparable following i.v. and oral dosing ~15.0 hours. Moderate drug accum ulation was 
observed with oral three -times -a-week schedule but not with the weekly i.v. schedule 
(1.4-fold drug accumulation with oral three -times -a-week dosing), consistent with the 
terminal half -life of 15 hours and dosing interval.  
 
In vitro experiments  suggested that the hepatic oxidative metabolism of panobinostat is 
mediated primarily by cytochrome P450 (CYP3A4), and to a lesser extent by CYP2D6 and 
CYP2C19. In addition to monooxygenation, hydrolysis of the hydroxamic chain were also 
found to be media ted (at least in -part) by the CYPs.  
 
Dose proportionality  
A positive and linear dose -exposure relationship was found following single i.v. 
administration (1.2 to 20 mg/m2, Rs = 0.83; p<0.0001). After oral dosing with 15 mg to 80 
mg of panobinostat, dose -proportionality analysis indicated that systemic exposure 
increased nearly  
dose -proportionally at doses below 60 mg and there is less than proportional increase in 
AUC after 60 mg and 80 mg doses of panobinostat. It appears that absorption may become 
limitin g at doses ꞏ 60 mg of panobinostat.  
 
Food Effect  
Influence of food on panobinostat PK was evaluated in patients with advanced cancer who 
received 20 mg panobinostat twice a week and were randomized to receive panobinostat  
under fasting, high fat, and normal breakfast conditions. The overall exposure and inter -
patient variability (CV 59%) in 34 patients remained unchanged with or without food, 
whereas Cmax was transiently reduced by <45% and Tmax prolonged by food (i.e., bo th 
normal and high fat breakfast). Since food did not alter the overall extent of absorption, 
food is unlikely to significantly impact panobinostat systemic exposure in cancer patients. 
Therefore, panobinostat can be administered without regard to food.

 Electrocardiographic experience and cardiac safety of with panobinostat. 
Cardiac safety in patients with hematologic malignancies  
As of 31 December 2013, cardiac safety data for 666 patients treated with oral 
panobinostat TIW QW are available. All patients underwent intensive pre - and post -dose 
ECG monitoring. The most common finding is a post -baseline QTc increase of >30 and 
ꞏ60 msec in approximately 22%. No cases of torsades de pointes have been observed. A 
post-baseline increase of >60 msec was less frequ ent (27 patients, 4.1%). QTc 
prolongation translating into an absolute value of 450 to 480 msec and of > 480 - 500 
msec was measured in 88 patients (13.4%) and in 17 patients (2.6%), respectively. 
Absolute QTc prolongation > 500 msec was uncommon (6 patien ts, 0.9%), mostly 
referred to 5 patients treated at 60 mg weekly dose level.  
The maximum change of QTc from baseline does not coincide with the peak 
plasma concentration -time course of panobinostat suggesting a possible 
delayed effect.  
 
Drug interactions  
Panobinostat is a CYP3A substrate and inhibits CYP2D6. Panobinostat is a P -
glycoprotein (P -gp) transporter system substrate.  
a. Agents that May Increase panobinostat Blood  Concentrations  
b. CYP3A  Inhibitors:  Coadministration  of panobinostat  with a strong  CYP3A  inhibitor  
increased the Cmax and AUC of panobinostat by 62% and 73% respectively, compared 
to when panobinostat was given  alone.  
c. Reduce dose to 10 mg when coadministered with strong CYP3A inhibitors (e.g., 
boceprevir, clarithromycin,  conivaptan,  indinavir,  itraconazole,  ketoconazole,  
lopinavir/ritonavir,  nefazodone, nelfinavir, posaconazole, ritonavir, saquinavir, telaprevir, 
telithromycin, voriconazole). Instruct patients to avoid star fruit, pomegranate or 
pomegranate juice, and grapefruit or grapefruit jui ce because these foods are known to 
inhibit CYP3A  enzymes.  
d. Agents that May Decrease panobinostat Plasma  Concentrations  
e. CYP3A Inducers: Coadministration of panobinostat with strong CYP3A inducers was 
not evaluated  in vitro or in a clinical  trial however,  a reduction  in panobinostat  exposure  is 
likely.  An approximately 70% decrease in the systemic exposure of panobinostat in the 
presence of strong  inducers  of CYP3A  was observed  in simulations  using  mechanistic  
models.  Therefore,  the concomitant use of strong CYP3A inducers should be avoided.  
f. Agents whose Plasma Concentrations May be Increased by  panobinostat  
g. CYP2D6  Substrates:  
Panobinostat increased the median Cmax and AUC of a sensitive substrate of 
CYP2D6 by approximately 80% and 60%, respectively; however t his was highly 
variable. Avoid coadministrating  
panobinostat with sensitive CYP2D6 substrates (i.e., atomoxetine, desipramine, 
dextromethorphan, metoprolol, nebivolol, perphenazine, tolterodine, and venlafaxine) or 
CYP2D6 substrates that have a narrow ther apeutic index (i.e., thioridazine, pimozide). If 
concomitant use of CYP2D6 substrates is unavoidable, monitor patients frequently for 
adverse reactions.  
h. Drugs that Prolong QT  interval  
i. Concomitant use of anti -arrhythmic medicines (including, but not limited  to 
amiodarone, disopyramide,  procainamide,  quinidine  and sotalol)  and other  drugs  that 
are known  to prolong the QT interval (including, but not limited to chloroquine, 
halofantrine, clarithromycin, methadone, moxifloxacin, bepridil and pimozide) is not 
2014 -0516  Version 16                                            2 5 February 2020  Page 27 of 42 
 
 recommended. Anti -emetic drugs with known  QT prolonging  risk, such  as dolasetron,  
ondansetron,  and tropisetron  can be used  with frequent ECG  monitoring.  
 
Hepatic Impairment  
a. The safety  and efficacy  of panobinostat  in patients  with hepatic  impairment  has not 
been evaluated.  
b. In a pharmacokinetic trial, patients with mild (bilirubi n ꞏ1xULN and AST >1xULN, or  bilirubin  
>1.0 to 1.5x ULN and any AST) or moderate (bilirubin >1.5x to 3.0x ULN, any AST) 
hepatic impairment (NCI -ODWG criteria) had increased AUC of panobinostat by 43% and 
105%, respectively. Reduce the starting dose of panobinostat in patients with mild or 
moderate hepatic impairment. Avoid use in patients with severe hepatic impairment. 
Monitor patients with hepatic impairment frequently for adverse  events.  
Renal Impairment  
d. Mild [creatinine clearance (CrCl) ꞏ50 to <80 mL/min] to severe renal impairment (CrCl 
<30 mL/min) did not impact the plasma exposure of panobinostat. Panobinostat has not 
been studied in patients with end stage renal disease (E SRD) or patients on dialysis. The 
dialyzability of panobinostat is unknown.  
Monitoring parameters:  
a. Complete Blood Count (CBC): Obtain a CBC before initiating treatment. Verify that 
the baseline  platelet  count  is at least  100 x 109/L  and the baseline  absolute  neutrophil  
count  (ANC) is at least 1.5 x 109/L. Monitor the CBC weekly (or more often as clinically 
indicated) during treatment.  
b. ECG: Perform an ECG prior to the start of therapy and repeat periodically during 
treatment as  clinically  indicated.  Verify that the QTcF  is less than 450 msec  prior to 
initiation  of treatment with  
panobinostat . If during treatment with panobinostat , the QTcF increases t o ꞏ480 msec, 
interrupt treatment. Correct any electrolyte abnormalities. If QT prolongation does not 
resolve, permanently discontinue treatment with panobinostat. During the clinical trial, 
ECGs were performed at baseline and prior to initiation of each cycle for the first 8 cycles.  
c. Serum Electrolytes: Obtain electrolytes, including potassium and magnesium , at 
baseline and monitor during therapy. Correct abnormal electrolyte values before 
treatment. During the trial,  monitoring  was conducted  prior to the start of each  cycle,  at 
Day 11 of cycles  1 to 8, and at the start of each cycle for cycles 9 to  16.

 diphosphate (dFdCDP) and Gemcitabine triphosphate (dFdCTP). The cytotoxic effects of 
Gemcitabine are exerted through incorporation of dFdCTP into DNA with the assistance of 
dFdCDP, resulting in inhibition of DNA synthesis and induction of apoptosis. Gemcitabine 
is a radiation -sensitizing agent.5 It is cell -cycle phase specific (S and G1/S -phases).

Syndromes  flu-like symptoms (19%, severe 1%)30  E 
 
 
Hemolytic uremic syndrome has been infrequently reported and is characterized by 
microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia and renal failure. The syndrome 
can present either acutely with severe hemolysis, thrombocytopenia and rapidly 
progressive renal failure, or more insidiously with mild or no thrombocytopenia and slowly 
progressive renal failure. The etiology of hemolytic uremic syndrome is unknown. The 
onset of the syndrome has been reported to occur during and shortly after gemcitabine 
therapy. If not treated promptly, the syndrome may result in irreversible renal failure  
requiring dialysis. Therefore, patients with impaired renal function should be monitored 
closely while being treated with gemcitabine.  
Elevated liver enzymes: Gemcitabine causes transient and reversible elevations of liver 
function enzymes in about two -thirds of patients. However, these increases are rarely of 
clinical significance and there is no evidence of increasing hepatic toxicity with either 
longer duration of Gemcitabine treatment or cumulative dose.  
Fever/Flu -like symptoms: Fever of any severity was reported in 37% of patients. It is 
frequently associated with other flu -like symptoms such as headache, chills, cough, 
rhinitis, myalgia, fatigue, sweating and insomnia. These symptoms are usually mild and 
transient, and rarely dose -limiting. The use o f acetaminophen may provide symptomatic 
relief.  
Severe pulmonary toxicity : Acute dyspnea may sometimes occur with gemcitabine 
therapy, but is usually self -limiting. However, severe pulmonary toxicities such as 
pulmonary edema, interstitial pneumonitis and adult respiratory distress syndrome have 
rarely been reported. The symptoms are manifested as progressive dyspnea, tachypnea, 
hypoxemia and pulmonary infiltrates on chest radiograph that are sometimes 
accompanied by fever and cough. Pulmonary toxicities us ually occur after several cycles 
of gemcitabine, but have also been seen as early as the first cycle. Risk factors for 
pulmonary toxicities include prior radiation to the mediastinum.  
Because of its structural similarities to cytarabine, gemcitabine is tho ught to cause lung 
injury by the same mechanism by inducing pulmonary capillary leakage. Management of 
pulmonary toxicities consists of discontinuation of gemcitabine and early supportive care 
with bronchodilators, corticosteroids, diuretics, and/or oxygen . Although pulmonary 
toxicities may be reversible with treatment, fatal recurrence of severe pulmonary symptoms 
was reported in one patient upon rechallenge with gemcitabine.  
Skin rash : Typically mild to moderate in severity, with macular or finely granula r 
maculopapular pruritic eruption on the trunk and extremities. It is not dose -limiting and 
usually responds to topical corticosteroids If needed, antihistamines such as 
diphenhydramine can be used.

Monitoring Parameters  
CBC with differential and platelet count (prior to each dose); hepatic and renal function (prior to 
initiation of therapy and periodically, thereafter); monitor electrolytes, including potassium, 
magnesium, and calcium (when in combination therapy with cisplatin)  
 
Administration  
 
Infuse over 30 minutes. Note: Prolongation of the infusion time > 60 minutes has been shown to 
increase toxicity (some unlabeled protoco ls may include infusion times > 30 minutes).  
Gemcitabine is being investigated in clinical trials for fixed dose rate (FDR) infusion 
administration at doses from 1000 -2200 mg/m2 at a rate of 10 mg/m2/minute. Prolonged 
infusion times increase the accumulati on of the active metabolite, gemcitabine 
triphosphate. Patients who receive gemcitabine FDR experience more grade 3/4 
2014 -0516  Version 16                                            2 5 February 2020  Page 32 of 42 
 
 hematologic toxicity.  
 
For intravesicular (bladder) instillation, gemcitabine was diluted in 50 -100 mL normal 
saline; patients were instru cted to retain in the bladder for 1 hour.  
Dosage Forms  
 
Powder for injection, lyophilized: 20 mg/mL (200 -mg and 1000 -mg vial)  
 
Reconstitute 200 mg vial with 5 mL of NS without preservative and 1000 mg vial with 25 
mL of NS without preservative to yield a G emcitabine concentration of 38 mg/mL. 
Reconstitution of concentrations greater than 40 mg/mL may result in incomplete 
dissolution and should be avoided. Reconstituted solution is stable for 24 hours at room 
temperature and should not be days at room temper ature and under refrigeration. However, 
the manufacturer recommends that the admixture be used within 24 hours since the 
solution does not contain preservatives.  
Bacterial challenge: Gemcitabine 2.4 mg/mL diluted in NS did not exhibit a 
substantial antimic robial effect on the growth of four organisms inoculated into the 
solution. Diluted solutions should be stored under refrigeration whenever possible and 
that the potential for microbiological growth should be considered when assigning 
expiration periods.

14.3.  Busulfan  
 
Therapeutic Classification : Antineoplastic Alkylating agent  
 
Pharmaceutical data : Busulfan injection is a sterile, pyrogen -free solution provided in a 
mixture of dimethylacetamide (DMA) and polyethyleneglycol 400 (PEG400). It is supplied 
in 10 ml single use ampoules at a concentration of six (6) mg busulfan per ml. Each 
ampoule contains 60 mg of busulfan in 3.3 ml of DMA and 6.7 ml of PEG400. When 
diluted in normal  saline or D5W to a concentration of 0.5 mg/ml, the resulting solution 
must be administered within eight  
(8) hours of preparation including the three (3) hour infusion of the drug.  
 
Stability  and storag e: Ampoules  should  be stored  refrigerate d at 2-8oC (35-46oF).  Stable  
at 4oC for at least twelve (12) months. Additional stability studies are in progress. DO NOT 
use beyond the expiration date. DO NOT use if the solution is cloudy or if particulates are  
present.  
 
Break off the top of the ampoule and use a syringe needle to remove the calculated 
volume of busulfan from the primary container. Remove the needle, replace with a new

 needle which has been fitted with a 5.0 micron nylon filter (provided with packaged drug) 
and transfer the contents of the syringe into the calculated amount of either normal saline 
or D5W making sure that the drug flows into and through the solution. Do not put the 
busulfan solution into a syringe or IV bag, which does not contain the normal saline or 
D5W. Mix by inverting the contai ner numerous times to ensure a homogenous solution. 
Place an appropriate label on the container with an expiration time of eight (8) hours from 
the time of preparation with directions to store at room temperature. Do not use if solution 
contains visible pa rticulates. Record the actual volume on the  label.  
 
Place a suitable (non -vented or universal) intravenous administration set (gravity flow) into 
the outflow port of the container of the infusion solution.  
 
Route of Administration: It is to be noted, that a sufficient amount of diluted busulfan 
should be added to compensate for the amount needed to prime the IV tubing; when 
hanging the infusate, the tubing should be primed with the busulfan solution and 
connected as close to the patient as possible, i.e. by  a 3-way connector at the level of the 
central venous catheter. After completed infusion, the tubing with remaining busulfan 
(approximately 12 mL) should be disconnected and discarded. All busulfan infusions 
should be performed by programmable, controlled -rate pump.  
 
The busulfan will be given by slow intravenous infusion over three (3) hours into a 
central venous catheter.  
 
CAUTION: DO NOT ADMINISTER AS AN INTRAVENOUS PUSH OR BOLUS . 
 
An infusion pump will be used with the busulfan solutions as prepared above. A new 
infusion set must be used for administration of each dose. Prior to and following each 
infusion, flush the catheter line with normal saline or (approximately 5 ml). Start the three -
hour infusion at the calculated flow rate.  
DO NOT infuse conco mitantly with another intravenous solution of unknown compatibility.  
 
If a delay in administration occurs after the infusion solution is prepared, the properly 
identified container should be kept at room temperature (20 -25oC), but administration 
must be co mpleted within eight (8) hours of preparation including the three (3) hour drug 
infusion.  
 
Side effects : Dose limiting toxicity is expected to be hematological when used without 
stem cell support. Other toxicities seen frequently following high -dose busulf an in 
preparative regimens for bone marrow transplantation include: VOD, nausea, vomiting, 
pulmonary fibrosis, seizures, rash, and an Addison’s -like syndrome.  
 
Mechanism of action: Interferes with DNA replication and transcription of RNA through 
DNA alkyla tion, and ultimately results in the disruption of nucleic acid function.  
 
Animal Tumor Data : Busulfan has been shown to be active against a variety of animal 
neoplasm in vivo , including mouse sarcoma 180 and Ehrlich’s mouse ascites tumor.  
 
Animal Toxicolog y: Busulfan fed to rats in an amount equivalent to about 0.5 mg/kg of final 
body weight per day slowed weight gain and produced bone marrow depression, pancytopenia 
and cataracts after about 10 weeks. In rats, LD5O was found to be 34 mg/kg intraperitoneall y.  
When the drug was administered on day 13, 14, or 15 of gestation at a dose of 10 mg/kg to 
2014 -0516  Version 16                                            2 5 February 2020  Page 34 of 42 
 
 rats, the progeny were prematurely sterile.  
 
Human Pharmacology : Limited pharmacology data are available for the parenteral 
formulation to  be used  in this study  and is detailed  in Attachment  II, Preliminary  
Pharmacokinetic  Evaluation of Busulfan in a Phase II human Trial. The pharmacokinetic 
data suggests that the plasma decay of the formulation fits a two -compartment model. 
The oral formulation is absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, and measurable blood 
levels are obtained within one -half to  two 
(0.5-2.0) hours after ingestion. Within three (3) minutes after IV administration in rats, 90% 
of the drug disappears from the blood; similar rapid decreases in blo od concentrations 
have been reported in man. Busulfan is reported to be extensively metabolized; twelve 
(12) metabolites have been isolated, but most have not been identified. The drug is slowly 
excreted in the urine, chiefly as methanesulfonic acid. Ten t o fifty percent (10 -50%) of a 
dose is excreted as metabolites within twenty -four (24) hours.

Monitoring Parameters  
 
CBC with differential and platelet c ount, liver function tests (evaluate transaminases, alkaline 
phosphatase, and bilirubin daily for at least 28 days post transplant)  
 
Administration  
 
Intravenous busulfan should be administered as a 2 -hour via central line.  
 
Premedicate  with prophylactic anticonvulsant therapy (e.g., phenytoin or Keppra) 
prior to high -dose busulfan treatment.  
 
14.4.  Melphalan  
 
Melphalan is an alkylating agent of the bischloroethylamine type. As a result, its 
cytotoxicity appears to be related to the exten t of its interstrand cross -linking with DNA, 
probably by binding at the N position of guanine. Like other bifunctional alkylating agents, 
it is active against both  
resting and rapidly dividing tumor cells.  
 
Formulation:  Melphalan for injection is supplied as a sterile, nonpyrogenic, freeze -dried 
powder. Each single -use vial contains melphalan hydrochloride equivalent to 50 mg 
melphalan and 20 mg  povidone.  
 
Preparation:  Melphalan for injection must be reconstituted by rapidly injecting 10 mL of 
the supplied diluent directly into the vial of lyophilized powder using a sterile needle and 
syringe. This provides a 5 mg/mL solution of melphalan. Immediately dilute the dose to  be 
administered in 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP, to a concentration not greater than 
0.45 mg/mL. Administer the diluted product over a minimum of 15 minutes. Complete the 
administration within 60 minutes of reconstitution.  
 
Storage and stability:  Melphalan for injection vials should be stored at controlled room 
temperature  15o to 30o C (59o to 86o F) and protected  from light.  The time between 
reconstitution/dilution and administration of melphalan should be kept to a minimum 
because reconstituted and diluted solutions of melphalan are unstable. Over as short a 
time as 30 minutes, a citrate derivative of melphalan has been detected in reconstitu ted 
2014 -0516  Version 16                                            2 5 February 2020  Page 37 of 42 
 
 material from the reaction of melphalan with the diluent. Upon further dilution with saline, 
nearly 1% label strength of melphalan hydrolizes every 10 minutes. A precipitate forms if 
the reconstituted solution  is stored  at 5o C.  Do not refrigerate  the reconstituted  product.  
Adverse events associated with melphalan:  The following information on adverse 
reactions is based on data from both oral and IV administration of melphalan as a single 
agent, using several different dose schedules for treatment of a  wide variety of 
malignancies. Please refer to the Adverse Reactions and Warnings sections of the 
product package insert.  
 
Hematologic: The most common side effect is bone marrow suppression. White blood 
cell count and platelet count nadirs usually occur 2  to 3 weeks after treatment, with 
recovery in 4 to 5 weeks after treatment. Irreversible bone marrow failure has been 
reported.  
 
Gastrointestinal: Gastrointestinal disturbances such as nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, 
and oral ulceration occur infrequently. Hepatic toxicity, including veno -occlusive disease, 
has been reported.

 glycoprotein  
Metabolism: Hepa tic; chemical hydrolysis to monohydroxymelphalan and dihydroxymelphalan 
Bioavailability: Unpredictable; 61% ± 26%, decreasing with repeated doses  
Half-life elimination: Terminal: I.V.: 75 minutes; Oral: 1 -2 
hours Time to peak, serum: ~1 -2 hours  
Excretion: Oral: Feces (20% to 50%); urine (~10% as unchanged drug)  
 
Hypersensitivity: Acute hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis were reported in 
2.4% of 425 patients receiving melphalan for myeloma. These reactions were 
characterized by urticaria, pruri tus, edema, and in some patients, tachycardia, 
hypotension and bronchospasm.  
These patients appeared to respond to antihistamine and corticosteroid therapy. If a  
hypersensitivity reaction occurs, IV or oral melphalan should not be readministered 
since hype rsensitivity reactions have also been reported with oral melphalan.  
 
Carcinogenesis: Secondary malignancies, including acute nonlymphocytic leukemia, 
myeloproliferative syndrome, and carcinoma, have been reported in patients with cancer 
treated with alkyla ting agents (including melphalan).  
 
Other: Other reported adverse reactions include skin hypersensitivity, skin ulceration at 
injection site, skin necrosis rarely requiring skin grafting, vasculitis, alopecia, hemolytic 
anemia, pulmonary fibrosis and inter stitial pneumonitis.  
 
Monitoring Parameters  
CBC with differential and platelet count, serum electrolytes, serum uric acid  
Administration  
Oral: Administer on an empty stomach (1 hour prior to or 2 hours after meals)  
Parenteral: Due to limited stability, complete administration of I.V. dose should occur within 60 
minutes of reconstitution  
I.V.: Infuse over 15 -30 minutes. Extravasation may cause local tissue damage; 
administration by slow injection into a fast running I.V. solution into an injection port or  via 
a central line is recommended; do not administer by direct injection into a peripheral vein.  
BMT only: Saline -based hydration preceding (2 -4 hours), during, and following (6 -12 hours) 
administration reduces risk of drug precipitation in renal tubules.  Hydrolysis causes loss of 1% 
melphalan injection per 10 minutes.

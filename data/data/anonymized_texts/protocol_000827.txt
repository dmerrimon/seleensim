Title of Study: A Phase 3 Multi-Center, One-Year , Open -Label Study of Setmelanotide in Pediatric 
 Patients Aged 2 to <6 Year s of Age with Rare Gen etic Causes o f Obesity  
Trial  center(s): Approximately 5 to 8 c enters in North America, Europe and/or Asia Pacific

Estimated date first patient enrolled: February 2022  
Estimated date last patient completed: September 2023  Phase of development: 3 
Trial  Objectives: 
 Primary:  
The primary obj ective of the trial is: 
To evaluate the effect of setmelanotide on weight-related parameters in pediatric patients aged 2  to 
<6 years with obesity due to either (1) biallelic variants of the POMC , PCSK1, or LEPR genes or 
 (2) Bardet - Biedl Syndrome (BBS ).  
Secondary:  
The seconda ry obj ective s of the trial are: 
To evaluate the effect of Setmelanotide  on additional weight -related parameters, as wel l as safety and 
 tolerability in pediatric patients aged 2 to <6  years with obesity due to either (1)  biallelic variants of the 
 POMC, PCSK1 , or LEPR genes or (2)  BBS . 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Methodology:  
This is a 1-year, open -label trial. 
Screen ing  
The Screening Period be gins with obt aining informed consent from the parent or guardian and w ill last 
between  1  and 8 week s. During the Screening Period, patients will undergo all procedures as outlined in 
 the Schedule of Asses sments (SoA; Table  1) to determine if they meet all of the Inclusion and none  of 
 the Exclusion criteria of the trial. 
 During the Screening Period, patients will undergo medical evaluation; and caregivers will receive 
training on injection of trial drug and other trial procedures.  
PPD
Protocol RM-493- 033 V5.0 
Rhythm Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Page 6 of 63  Confidential Enrollment and trial procedures  
 At the enrollment visit, patients will undergo all procedures as outlined in the SoA ( Table  1) and it  will 
be reco nfirmed that the patient continues to meet all of the Inclusion and none  of the Exclusion criteria 
 of the trial. 
At the enrollment visit, the patient will have height and body weight recorded. This will be the baseline 
height and w eight.  To be eligible for  the trial, a patient’s baseline weight must be at least 15 kg. Height 
 and w eight will be monitored closely during the trial.  
During the enrollment visit, the car egiver will administer the patient’s first dose of setmelanotide via 
subcutaneous  (SC) injection un der the supervision of the trial staff. Patients’ caregivers will be issued 
 and instructed on the use of an electronic diary to capture daily compliance wi th injections.  
All patients will begin treatment with setmelanotide at a dose of 0.5  mg per day. Patients will then 
 increase t heir dose by 0.5  mg increments, every 2  week s, as described in the SoA ( Table  1). The 
 maximum dose level of setmelan otide used in this trial  will be based on the wei ght bands for the 2 - to 
<6-year -old patients to support an exposure similar to that observed for adults dosed at 2 to 3 mg 
setsetmmelelananoottiidde e oonn ce ce ddaailyily ( ( QDQD)). Th. Thee m maaximum dose level in this trial  for patients who  weigh <20  kg, 
   will be 0.5  mg, 1.0 mg, 1.5 mg and 2. 0  mg QD, respectively.  
 If a patient’s wei ght decreases to below 15  kg during the trial, the Investigator and Sponsor will discuss 
 the patient’s status and will jointly determine if a patient should continue the current dose, decrease t he 
dose or discontinue treatment with setmelanotide tempor arily or permanently. A dose reduction to 
0.25 mg QD can be considered in such scen arios or in case o f safety or tolerabili ty concerns . These d ose 
 adjustments are considered adequate to help attain  and maintain  appropriate body  weight  in growing 
 pediatric patients . 
 
At the discretion of the Investigator, the dose escal ation  may be paused for a patient  at any step p rior to 
 reaching their final maintenance dose, for safety or tolerability reasons, or due to achieving adequate 
weight loss. The dose may continue to be evaluated and adjusted, at the discretion of  the Investigator, as 
long a s the daily dos e is kept between 0.25 mg and 2.0 mg QD, according to their respective weight.  
Patients will have trial visits approximately every 4 week s through Week  20 and then approximately 
 every 8  week s through Week  52, and assess ments will be performed as per the SoA ( Table  1). Due to 
 the young age of the patients, it may not be possible to perform all planned asses sments at each visit. 
Thus, as described in the SoA ( Table  1), the Investigator may  adjust the planned assessments and bl ood 
 draws as appropriate for the optimal medical care of the patients.  
In specific, i ndividual cases, dose escalation m ay be delayed compared to the originally planned 
 schedule at enrollment, in order to mitigate potential tolerability issues (e.g ., in case o f gastrointestinal 
 adverse ev ents). If the esca lation to the next dose level is delayed, the esc alation period will be extended  
for that patient and the subsequent available site visits will then become “dose escalation” visits, where 
the appropriate and specific asse ssments related to the escal ation visits will take place.  
End of Treatment  
The End of Treatment (EOT) will occur as an  in -person clinic visit on Trial We ek  52, which is the final 
 day of treatment with setmelanotide. At the EOT, patients who are considered likely to benefit from 
continued setmelanotide treatment and w ho ha ve completed this trial may be eligible to enter an ope n-
label long -term extension (LTE)  trial with setmelanotide. Patients  and or  ca regivers/guardians  must 
 meet the eligibility criteria and should discuss eligibility with the Investigator. E ligible patients may 
 participate in Bridging visits (every 12 week s) (Table  1) if the LTE is not yet active. 
All patients who di scontinue treatment prematurely should attend an Early Termination of  Treatment 
visit (ETT) as so on as possible after the last dose of trial treatment. Patients who discontinue treatment 
 but remain enrolled in the trial should continue to complete all assessments (as Retained Dropouts). 
These p atients will be required to complete the End of  Study visit (EOS) as ap plicable following the 
PPD
Protocol RM-493- 033 V5.0 
Rhythm Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Page 7 of 63  Confidential ETT ( Section  5.1.5 ). Patients who discontinue treatment prematurely but remain enrolled and complete 
assessments through Week  52 are eligible to enroll in the optional LTE trial. 
Patients who discontinu e prematurely and withdraw from the trial will not be required to complete the 
EOS following the ETT. If the ETT visit occurs 4  weeks or later following the last dose of 
Setmelanotide, then the ETT v isit will replace the EOS if no AEs are being monitored.  
End of Study  
A final End of Study ( EOS ) v isit will occur on  Week  56 and may be conducted via telephone for 
patients who are not being monitored for an AE. The EOS v isit is not  required for patients who enroll in 
the LTE (or transition to Bridging v isits pr ior to LTE).  
At the Investigator’s discretion and in consultation with the Sponsor, patients who have well tolerated 
se
tmelanotide, who are considered likely to benefit from continued treatment, and who have completed 
assessments through Week  52 may be offered continued setmelanotide treatment via:  
• Enrollment in a separate LTE trial . 
• Bridging visits until LTE availability (if the LTE trial is not active by the time of patient 
completion of this trial). See  Table  1. 
• Commercial use of Setmelanotide QD, if applicable, according to the approved  indication in 
their country, and in consultation with their prescribing physician 
Completion of trial participation for an individual patient is defined as 1 of the following:  
• For patients who complete trial treatment and enroll in the LTE: the in -person EOT visit at 
Week  52. 
• For patients who complete treatment and do not enroll in the LTE: a Week  56 visit conducted 
via telephone .  
• For patients who discontinue trial treatment prematurely and complete all assessments, but do not withdraw consent (and assent, as applicable): the latest of the Week  52 visit, the ETT v isit, 
or EOS (if required). 
• For patients who discontinue early and wit hdraw consent  or assent : the ETT visit. 
The end of the trial is defined as the date of the last visit of the last patient under the auspices of the current trial. 
Number of patients (planned):  
The trial plans to enroll approximately 10-15 pediatric patien ts (approximately 5 or more with biallelic 
mutations of the POMC , PCSK1 , or LEPR genes and approximately 5 or more with BBS) in a pivotal

Details of all statistical analyses wi ll be described in a sep arate statistical analysis plan (SAP). The trial 
plans to enroll approximately 10- 15 pediatric patients (approximately 5  or more patients with biallelic 
 mutations of the POMC, PCSK1 or LEPR genes and approximately 5 or more patients with BBS). The 
 sample size is not driven by statistical power considerations , but is primarily driven by clinical and 
 practical considerations. 
The primary objective is to evaluate the effect of setmelanotide on weight-related parameters, measured 
in terms of the response rate to setmelanotide. Due to the small sample size of the trial, no statistical 
hypothesis testing is planned, and efficacy will be reported using descriptive statistics. The safety 
popul ation, including all patients who receive at least 1 dose of setmelanotide, will be used as the 
primary analysis popul ation for all the analyses.  
AEs will be coded by preferred term (PT) and system organ class (SOC) using the latest version of the 
Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). All AE data will be presented in a data 
listing. Treatment-emergent AEs will be summarized by severity and relationship to trial drug. Serious 
AEs and AEs leading to early discontinuation will also be presented in data listings.  
Actual values and changes from baseline for clinical laboratory test results, vital sign measurements 
etc., will be summarized using descriptive statistics (N, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, 
 and maximum). Shift tables will be generated for clinical laboratory test results. Clinical laboratory test 
results, vital sign measurements etc. , will be presented in data listings.

*Note: If there are <2  weeks between screening and enrollment, the enrollment visit physical examination may be waived.  
**Drug is dispensed at the EOT only for patients who continue to the Bridging visits.  
1 Patients should attend dose -escalation visits as appropriate per their respective escalation regimen, which is dictated by their wei ght, until achieving maximum 
 dose level. See Section  7.3 for details.  
2 The dose may continue to be evaluated and adjusted, at the discretion of the  Investigator, in 0.5 mg increments, so long as the daily dose is kept between 
 0.5 mg and  the weight- based maximum for the patient (see Table  3). 
3 EOS v isit should occur within 4  weeks of the last dose of study drug for patients who either discontinue prematurely or for patients who are being monitored 
 for an adverse event ( AE) after the EOT. This visit is not required for patients who complete the Week  52 visit and either enroll in the LTE or transition to 
 Bridging visits.  
4 A complete physical examination will be conducted at screening and at the EOT visit. At other timepoints, an abbreviated examination will be performed. The 
 abbreviated examination should focus on heart, lungs, skin, neurologic exam, and any areas of previous abnormal findings, noting any changes from baseline. 
Tanner staging should be performed at Screening and a t the EOT (Week  52) visit. It may be done at additional visits, at the discretion of the Investigator  
5 A comprehensive skin evaluation will be performed by the Investigator or qualified designee. The skin exam should include a f ull body  skin exam (head -to-toe 
skin examination). Any concerning lesions identified during the Screening Period will be biopsied and results known to be benign prior to the first dose of 
 setmelanotide. If the pre -treatment biopsy results are of concern, the patient will be exclude d from the trial. Additionally, any new lesion or change in an 
 existing lesion identified during the course of the trial must be evaluated by a dermatologist and biopsied, if clinically indicated in the opinion of the 
 dermatologist.  
6 Weight (kg) is to be measured at the clinic using the same scale throughout the trial or at home (during virtual visits or visiting nurse visits) using the same 
 scale provided to the patient as part of the clinical trial. Weight should be measured after patients have attempted to empty their bladders and after fasting for

be obtained at the beginning and the end of the trial to monitor for growth related safety concerns.  
19 The ASQ -3 is intended for use at six -month intervals for patients between 6  months and 3  years of age, and then at 1-year intervals through age  5. Thus, for 
patients who enter the trial at ages between 2  years and 3  years, the ASQ -3 should be administered at the Baseline visit, Week  28 visit and EOT visit. For 
patients who enter the trial between the ages of 3  and 6  years old, the ASQ -3 should only be administered at the Baseline visit and EOT visit.  
20 A blood sample will be obtained at baseline to confirm a genetic diagnosis. However, patients may be entered into the trial with documentation of  previously

3.1. Trial  Rationale  
Human genetic trials have identified several diseases that are the result of genetic variants 
affecting the melanocortin -4 receptor (MC4R) pathway, including, but not limited to, pro-
opiomelanocortin (POMC) deficiency obesity due to mutations in the POMC gene; heterozygous 
proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 1 (PCSK1) deficiency due to mutations in the PCSK1 
gene, leading to a hormone processing defect that also causes POMC deficiency obesity; and leptin receptor (LEPR) deficiency obesity due to mutations in the LEPR gene. These MC4R 
pathway mutations cause rare genetic diseases of obesity that start early in childhood, progress over time, and can become life- threatening in severity.  
Setmelanotide, an MC4R agonist, has the potential to restore reduced activity in MC4Rs in 
patients with these genetic defects in MC4R pathway. Consequently, the effect of setmelanotide 
may serve as a form of “replacement” therapy to re-establish weight and appetite control in patients with these disorders.  
Previous clinic al trials  have shown evidence that setmelanotide can help manage weight and 
reduce hunger in children with these genetic variants ( Haws  2020; Clément  2020). The daily 
formulation (QD) of setmelanotid e is authorized  for commercial use in the United States (US) 
the European Union (EU), and Canada in adult and pediatric patients 6 years of age and older 
with obesity due to Bardet- Biedl Syndrome (BBS ) (USPI 2022, EU SmPC 2022, Product 
Monograph 2023). Setm elanotide is also authorized  for commercial use in the US, Great Britain 
(GB),  the EU , Israel, and Canada in adult and pediatric patients 6 years of age and older with 
obesity due to pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC), proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 1 (PCSK1), or leptin receptor (LEPR) deficiency (collectively PPL deficiency obesity  (USPI 2022, 
EU SmPC 2022 , MHRA SmPC 2022 , Israel PPI 2022 ; Product Monograph 2023) 
In this study, the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of setmelanotide will be studied in pediatric patients aged 2  to <6 years with variants in POMC , PCSK1  or LEPR genes or with Bardet- Biedl 
Syndrome (BBS). 
3.2. Setmelanotide  
Setmelanotide is a synthetic, cyclic octapeptide (8 -amino acid -containing peptide) that functions 
as a potent MC4R agonist. Setmelanotide binds with high affinity (inhibitory constant = 2.1 nM) to the human MC4R and is efficient in activating MC4R (50% effective concentration  = 
0.27 nM). While not an analog, it retains the specificity and functionality of the naturally 
occurring POMC-derived neuropeptide, α -MSH,  which is the endogenous ligand for the MC4R. 
Setmelanotide is more potent and has a much longer half -life (~10 -12 hours in humans) than the 
short- lived α -MSH ligand. 
The setmelanotide peptide was initially selected for clinical development based on its acceptable 
circulating half- life as a saline formulation (2.8  - 3.5 hours in non-human primates) and the 
ability to decrease body weight gain and suppress food intake in normal rats. Pre- clinical studies 
demonstrated the efficacy of setmelanotide in suppressing food intake and body weight gain in diet-induced obese mice, r ats, dogs, and monkeys, as well as in genetic models of obesity, 
including leptin -deficient ob/ob mice and leptin receptor deficient obese Zucker rats. Later 

Protocol  RM-493- 033 V5.0 
Rhythm Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Page 23 of  63  Confidential studies in obese monke ys showed that setmelanotide did not  increase blood pressure (BP) or 
heart r ate (HR), a potential concern observed with other MC4R agonist compounds . 
 To suppor t clinical trials, the toxicological profile of setmelanotide formulations has been 
 evaluated in repeat -dose continuous  SC infusion toxicity studies up to 13 weeks in dur ati on in 
rats and monkeys. The formulation used in almost all of these studies, including the pivotal 28-
day and 13- week toxicology s tudies, was setmelanotide in 0.9 % sodium chloride for injection 
(setmelanotide-saline formulation), tested ove r a range of concentrations. An International 
Counc il for Harmonisation (ICH)- compliant battery of in vitro and in vivo genetic toxicity 
 studies that included a bacterial mutation assay , a chromosomal aberration assay  in cultured 
human peripheral blood l ymphoc ytes and a rat micronuc leus study ha s been completed with this 
formulation. Finally, chronic, reproductive, and juvenile toxicology s tudies using the RM-493-
mPEG -DSPE formulation have been completed. 
 Setmelanotide has been well tolerated by patients who have received it in clinical trials . 
Regardless of formulation, setmelanotide has demonstrated a mostly similar set of adverse ev ents 
(AEs) in bot h short-term and long- term clinical trials . 
3.3. Benefit/Risk Assessment  
Current development of setmelanotide is focused on assess ing the risks and benefits in several 
genetic diseases o f early -onset severe obesity that result from rare genetic mutations that impair 
 the hypot halamic leptin- POMC- melanocortin pathway upstream fro m the MC4R. Setmelanotide, 
 an MC4R agonist, may restore the impaired signaling of this pathway. Data obtained to date in 
the setmelanotide clinical development program demonstrate robust reduction in weight and 
hunger in patients with rare genetic disease s of obesity.  
 
 
 
More detailed information about the know n and expected benefits and risks and reasonably 
expected AEs of setmelanotide may be found i n the Investigator’s Brochure (IB).

5.1. Overall Trial  Design  
This is a P hase 3 multi -center, ope n- label trial of setmelanotide in pediatric patients aged 2  to 
<6 years with rare genetic cau ses of obesity. The trial is designed to evaluate safety and 
 tolerability of setmelanotide as well as its efficacy on weight- related parameters in pediatric 
 patients.  
5.1.1.  Trial  Population  
The trial plans to enroll pediatric patients with biallelic mu tations of the POMC , PCSK1  or LEPR  
genes an d pediatric patients with BBS . 
5.1.2.  Screen ing Period  
The Screening Period be gins with obtaining informed consent from the parent or guardian and 
will last between 1  and 8 w eeks. During the Screening Period, patients will unde rgo all 
 procedures as outlined in the Schedule of Assess ments (SoA;  Table  1) to determine if th ey me et 
all of the Inclusion ( Section  6.1) and none  of the Exclusion criteria (Section  6.2) for trial 
eligibility . A patient who doe s not meet one or more of the eligibility  criteria will be considered a 
 screen failure. Any patient that is rescreened is required to have a new ICF  signed by the parent 
 or guardian. 
During the Screening Period, patients will undergo medical evaluation; and caregivers will 
receive training on i njection of  trial drug  and ot her trial procedures. 
 5.1.3.  Enrollment and trial procedures  
At the enrollment visit, patients will undergo all procedures as outlined in the SoA (Table  1) and 
it will be reconfirmed that the patient continues to meet all of the Inclusion and none  of the 
Exclusion criteria of the trial. 
At the enrollment visit, the patient will have height and body weight recorded. This will be the 
baseline height and w eight. To be eligible for the trial, a patient’s baseline weight must be at 
least 15 kg. Height and weight will be monitored closely during the trial . 
During the enrollment visit, the caregiver will administer the patient’s first dose of s etmelanotide 
 via subcutaneous ( SC) injection unde r the supervision of  the trial  staff. Patients’ caregivers will 
 be issued an electronic diary to capture daily compliance with injections.  
All patients will begin treatment with setmelanotide at a dose of 0. 5 mg per day. Patients will 
 then increase their dose by 0.5 mg increments, every 2  weeks, as described in the SoA ( Table  1). 
The maximum dose level of setmelanotide used in this trial  will be based on the weight bands for 
 the 2- to <6- year-old patients to support an expos ure similar to that observed for adults dosed at 
 22  ttoo  33  mmgg  sseettmmeellaannoottiiddee  QQDD..  TThhee  mmaaxxiimmuumm  ddoosse level in this trial for patients who w eigh 
 ill be 0.5 mg , 1.0 mg , 1.5 mg  and 2.0 mg QD, 
 rreessppeeccttiivveellyy..    
If a patient’s weight decreases t o below 15  kg dur ing the trial, the Investigator and R hythm 
 Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (he nceforth Spons or) will discuss the patient’s status and will jointly 
PPD
Protocol  RM-493- 033 V5.0 
Rhythm Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Page 26 of 63  Confidential determine if a patient should continue the current dose, decrease the dose or discontinue 
treatment with setmelanotide temporarily or permanently. A dose reduction to 0.25  mg QD can 
be co nsidered in such scenarios or in case of tolerability concerns, including for example, the 
occurrence of sever e renal impairment. These dose adjustments are considered adequate for the 
pediatric patients to grow in height at a normal rate and support attaining and maintaining an 
appropriate body weight.  
At the discretion of the Investigator, the dose escalation for a patient may be temporarily paused 
at any step  prior to reaching their final maintenance dose, for safety or tolerability reasons, or 
due to achieving adequate weight loss. The dose may continue to be evaluated and adjusted, at 
the discretion of the Investigator, so long as the daily dose is kept between 0.25 mg and 2.0 mg QD, according to their respective weight.  
Patients will have trial visits approximately every 4 weeks through Week  20 and then 
approximately every 8 weeks through Week  52 and assessments will be performed as per the 
SoA ( Table  1). Due to the young age of the patients, it may not be possible to perform all 
planned assessments at each visit. Thus, as described in the SoA ( Table  1), the Investigator may 
adjust the planned assessments and blood draws as appropriate for the optimal medical care of  
the patients.   
In specific, individual cases, dose escalation may be delayed compared to the originally planned 
schedule at enrollment, in order to mitigate potential tolerability issues (e.g. , in case of 
gastrointestinal adverse events). If the escalation to the next dose level is delayed, the escalation 
period will be extended for that patient and the subsequent available site visits will then become 
“dose escalation” visits, where the appropriate and specific assessments related to the escalation visits will take place.  
5.1.4. End of Treatment  
The End of Treatment (EOT) will occur as an in -person clinic visit on Tri al Week  52, which is 
the final day of treatment with setmelanotide. At the EOT, patients who are considered likely to benefit from continued setmelanotide treatment and who have completed this trial may be 
eligible to enter an open -label long- term extension (LTE) trial with setmelanotide. Patients must 
meet the eligibility criteria and should discuss eligibility with the Investigator.  Eligible patients 
may participate in Bridging visits (every 12  weeks) ( Table  1) if the LTE is not yet active.  
All patients who discontinue treatment prematurely should attend an Early Termination of 
Treatment vi sit (ETT) as soon as possible after the last dose of tri al treatment. Patients who 
discontinue treatment but remain enrolled in the trial should continue to complete all assessments 
(as Retained Dropouts). These patients will be required to complete the End of Study (EOS) as 
applicable following the ETT ( Sectio n 5.1.5). Patients who discontinue treatment prematurely 
but remain enrolled and complete assessments through Week  52 are eligible to enroll in the 
optional LTE trial.  
Patients who discontinue prematurely and withdraw from the trial will not be required to complete the EOS visit following the ETT. If the ETT visit occurs 4  weeks or later following the 
last dose of Setmelanotide, then the ETT visit will replace the EOS  visit if no AEs are being 
monitored.

A final EOS visit will occur on  Week  56 a nd may  be conducted via telephone for patients who 
are not being monitored for an AE . The EOS visit is not required for patients who enrol l in the 
LTE (or transition to Bridging visits prior to enrollment in the LTE).   
At the Investigator’s discretion and in consultation with the Sponsor, patients who have well 
tole
rated setmelanotide, who are  considered likely to benefit from continued trea tment , and who 
have completed assessments through Week 52 may be offered continued setmelanotide treatment via: 
• Enrollment in a separate LTE trial .  
• Bridging visits until LTE availability (if the LTE trial is not active by the time of patient completion of this trial). See  Table  1. 
• Commercial use of s etmelano tide QD, if applicable, according to the approved 
indication in their country, and in consultation with their prescribing physician. 
5.1.6. Completion of Trial Participation  
Completion of trial participation for an individual patient is defined as 1  of the follow ing: 
• For patients who complete trial treatment and enroll in the LTE: the in -person EOT 
visit at Week  52. 
• For patients who complete treatment and do not enroll in the LTE: a Week 56 visit conducted via telephone.  
• For patients who discontinue trial treatment prematurely and complete all assessments, but do not withdraw consent (and assent, as applicable): the latest of the Week  52 visit, the ETT visit, or EOS  visit (if required). 
• For patients who discontinue early and withdraw consent or assent: the ETT visit. 
The end of the trial is defined as the date of the last visit of the last patient under the auspices of the current trial.  
5.2. Site Closure and Study Termination  
5.2.1. Site Closure  
The Sponsor or designee reserves the right to close the trial site or termin ate the trial at any time 
for any reason at the sole discretion of the Sponsor. Trial sites will be closed upon trial  
completion. A trial site is considered closed when all required documents and trial supplies have 
been collected and a trial- site closure visit has been performed.  
The Investigator may initiate trial -site closure at any time, provided there is reasonable cause and 
sufficient notice is given in advance of the intended termination.  

Protocol  RM-493- 033 V5.0 
Rhythm Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Page 28 of 63  Confidential Reasons for the early closure of a trial site by the Sponsor or Investigator may include but are not 
limited to:  
For trial termination:  
• Discontinuation of further trial intervention development.  
For site termination:  
• Failure of the Investigator to comply with the protocol, the requirements of the 
IRB/IEC  or local health authorities, the Sponsor's procedures, or GCP guidelines.  
• Inadequate or no recruitment (evaluated after a reasonable amount of time) of patient s 
by the investigator. 
• Total number of patients enrolled earlier than expected.  
5.2.2. Criteria for Trial  Termination  or Suspension  
This trial may be prematurely terminated  or suspended , if in the opinion of the Sponsor, there is 
sufficiently reasonable cause. The Sponsor will provide written notification documenting the reason for trial  or site termination.  
Circumstances that may warrant termination include, but are not limited to:  
• Determination of unexpected, significant, or unacceptable risk to patients. 
• Failure to enroll patients into the trial . 
• Insufficient adherence to protocol requirements.  
• Insufficient complete and/or evaluable data.  
• Plans to modify, suspend, or discontinue the development of the trial drug. 
If the trial is prematurely terminated or suspended, the Sponsor shall promptly inform the 
Investigators, the Independent Ethics Committees (IECs)/IRBs, the regulatory authorities, and 
any contract research organization(s) used in the trial of the reason for termination or suspension, as specified by the applicable regulatory requirements. The Investigator shall promptly inform 
the patients and should assure appropriate patient  therapy and/or follow -up. Should the trial be 
closed prematurely, all trial materials must be returned to the Sponsor or designee.

11. Any other uncontrolled endocrine, metabolic or medical condition(s) known to impact 
body weight that could potentially interfere with interpretation of trial results.  
6.3. Trea tment Discontinuation and Patient Withdrawal Criteria 
Given this rare patient population, every effort will be made to encourage and keep patients enrolled in the trial until completion, regardless of premature treatment discontinuation. In the 
case of tre atment discontinuation, efforts should be made to keep the patient in the trial , 
attending at a minimum the key trial visits, e.g., the EOT ( and EOS as necessary)  visit, for safety 
evaluations. 
The Sponsor will provide assistance for patient and caregiver travel and will provide other 
necessary logistical support to ease the burden on the patient in order to facilitate compliance.  
Patients can withdraw their consent to participate in the trial at any time. If the parent or their 
legal guardian(s) withdraw consent/assent for disclosure of future information, the Sponsor may 
retain and continue to use any data collected before such a withdrawal of consent. 
If a patient and/or their legal guardian(s) withdraw from the trial, they may request destruction of 
any samples taken and not tested, and the Investigator must document this in the site trial 
records.  
Patients and their legal guardian(s) will be informed that they have the right to withdraw from 
the trial at any time for any reason, without prejudice to thei r medical care. The Investigator also 
has the right to withdraw patients from the trial for reasons such as:  
• AEs, which in the opinion of Investigator justifies treatment or trial withdrawal.  
• Non-adherence to trial drug regimen or protocol requirements. 
• Non-compliance with instructions or failure to return for follow -up.

7.1. Description of Trial  Drug  
Setmelanotide will be supplied by the Spons or. Setmelanotide drug pr oduct (RM-493- mPEG -
DSPE formulation) is a sterile solution for injection. The product is manufactured at a 
concentration of 10.0 mg/mL.  
7.2. Treatment Dose Selection  
The dose of setmelanotide was ch osen for this trial  based on effective doses in other clinical 
 trials, a review of the amount of benzyl alcohol in the formulation and the pharmacokinetic (PK) 
results in previous clinical trials . 
7.2.1.  Benzyl Alcohol Dose  
The amount of benzyl alcohol in the formulation was compared with the amount delivered by 
Increlex  (Increlex  Product SmPC ), an approved produc t containing phe nol and be nzyl alcohol. 
 Each mL of Increlex contains 10 mg/mL mecasermin and 9  mg/mL  benzyl alcohol. 
 Based on P osology, t he recommended starting do se of mecasermin is 0.04 mg/kg of  body w eight

Setmelanotide will be administered as a SC injection. All patients will begin treatment at a dose 
of 0.5 m g of setmelanotide per day. Patients will then increase their dose by 0.5 mg increments, 
every 2 w eeks, as described in the SoA ( Table  1). The maximum dose level of setmelanotide 
 used in this trial will be based on t he weight bands for the 2- to <6 -year-old patients to suppor t 
 an expos ure similar to that observed for adults dosed at 2 2   tto 3 o 3 mmgg set setmmelelananoottiidde e QDQD. T. Thehe  
 mamaxxiimumum dose level in this trial for patients who weigh  
  will be 0.5 mg , 1.0 mg , 1.5 mg  and 2.0 mg QD, r, reesspepeccttiivevelly. y.   
 If a patient’s weight decreases t o below 15  kg dur ing the trial, the Investigator and Sponsor will 
 discuss the patient’s status and will jointly determine if a patient should continue the current 
dose, decrease the dose or discontinue treatment with setmelanotide temporarily or  permanently. 
 A dose reduction to 0.25  mg can be considered in such scen arios or in case of safety or 
tolerability concerns . These d ose ad justments are considered adequate to help attain  and maintain  
appropriate body weight  in growing pediatric patients. 
 At the discretion of the Investigator, a patient may temporarily pause the dose esca lation at any 
 step p rior to reaching their final maintenance dose, for safety or tolerability reasons, or due to 
 achieving adequate weight loss. The dose may continue to be evaluated and adjusted, at the 
PPD
PPD
PPD
Protocol RM-493- 033 V5.0 
Rhythm Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Page 40 of  63  Confidential discretion of the Investigator, as   and 2. 0 mg QD, 
according to their respective weigighht.t.   
During the Dose Escalation visits (Week s 2, 4 and 6 in SoA ), the dose is to be increased  as 
 appropriate for the individual patient’s weight at enrollment. At each visit, the decision  to 
escal ate the dose is to be based on pa tients’ tolerability  and health status. If a patient has already 
 achieved their final maintenance dose prior to Week  4 or 6, the subsequent visits will not be 
 considered “dose escalation” visits, but rather standard visits. 
It is recommended to maintain a 2 -week interval between the dose escalations, althoug h the dose 
 may be escalated at a longer interval (i.e., within 4  weeks), depending on patient weight and 
 tolerability.  
If it is not possible to achieve the final maintenance dose by Week  6 due  to tolerability concerns 
 (e.g., severe gastrointestinal adverse events) or due to potential effects on weight or hunger 
levels, the dose may be escal ated over the next visit(s) (Week  8, etc.), with trial visits continued 
 as per protocol. There is no ne ed to perform an Unscheduled Visit 2 weeks after escalation of the 
dose unless it is required for patient safety.  
7.4. Concomitant M edic ations  
Any m edication or  vaccine (including ove r- the-counter or prescription medicines, vitamins, 
 and/or herbal supplements) that the patient is receiving at the time of enrollment or receives 
during the trial must be recorded along w ith: 
 • Reason for use 
 • Dates of administration including start and end dates  
• Dosage information including dos e and frequency 
 The Medical Monitor should be contacted if there are any qu estions regarding concomitant or 
prior therapy. 
The dose of concomitant medications used dur ing the trial should not  be changed and new 
concomitant medications should not  be started during the trial , unless n ecessary to treat an AE.  
Patients should not make significant changes to their diet or exercise routines during the trial. 
7.5. Treatment Compliance 
Treatment compliance will be recorded by the pediatric patient’s caregiver. A daily question 
querying w hether the patient completed their daily injection will be asked via electronic diary. 
With Spons or approval, paper versions can be used, if required. 
7.6. Random ization an d Blinding 
This is an open -label trial  with a single treatment arm, therefore there is no randomization and 
 the treatment is unbl inded. 
PPD
Protocol RM-493- 033 V5.0 
Rhythm Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Page 41 of 63  Confidential 8. ASSESSMENTS  
Trial procedures and their timing are summariz ed in the SoA ( Table  1). Adherence to the trial 
design requirements, including those specified in the SoA, is essential and required for trial 
conduct. 
All screening evaluations must be completed and reviewed to confirm that potential patients 
meet all eligibility criteria. The Investigator will maintain a screening log to record details of all 
patients screened and to confirm eligibility or record reasons for screening failure, as applicable.  
When scheduled at the same time point, the order of procedures should be as follows: obtain 
vital s igns, perform 12-lead ECG, and then perform blood draws (at the specified time point, if 
applicable). Adjustments may be made depending upon specific circumstances and in 
consultation with the Sponsor. 
A visiting home nurse may assist with injections at ho me if requested by families, provided that 
a caregiver needs or desires assistance, and this is acceptable to the investigative site.  
Immediate safety concerns should be discussed with the Sponsor immediately upon occurrence 
or awareness to determine if th e patient should continue or discontinue trial  treatment.  
8.1. General Trial  Assessments  
8.1.1. Informed Consent/Assent  
A complete description of the trial is to be presented to the parent/legal guardian(s) of each potential patient and signed and dated. Informed consent/assent is to be obtained before any 
study- specific procedures are performed. In the event of an amendment to the informed consent, 
reconsent by the patient or parent/legal guardian is necessary.  
A copy of the informed consent/assent must be provided to the patient or the parent/legal 
guardian. 
8.1.2. Demographic/Medical History  
Medical history and demographic data including the patient’s gender, race, date of birth, and 
concomitant medication use will be obtained for all patients during the Screening Period.  
The medical history should be updated on Day 1 prior to first dose of trial drug, to assess 
continued trial eligibility and adherence to final inclusion/exclusion criteria. This medical history 
update includes a review for changes from Screening as well as a review of the patient’s recent medication use to assess whether any changes have occurred since the previous visit.  
Additionally, weight-related history including growth charts since birth should be obtained and 
reported. 
8.1.3. Genetic Sample  
A blood sample will be obtained at baseline to confirm a genetic diagnosis. However, patients 
may be entered into the trial with documentation of previously obtained genetic results. 

Protocol RM-493- 033 V5.0 
Rhythm Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Page 42 of 63  Confidential 8.1.4. Physical Examination  
A complete physical examination will be conducted at Screening and at the EOT visit. At other 
timepoints, an abbreviated examination will be performed. The abbreviated examination should 
focus on heart, lungs, skin, neurologic exam ination , and any areas of previous abnormal findings, 
noting any changes from baseline. Tanner staging should be performed at Screening and at the 
EOT visit (Week  52) visit. It may be done at additional visits, at the discretion of the 
Investigator. 
8.1.5. Electrocardiogram (ECG)  
A single 12- lead ECG will be performed at the time points designated in the SoA ( Table  1). If an 
ECG is not practical in a young patient, it may be replaced by a rhythm strip and HR and pulse 
rate interval should be documented. The ECG (or HR and pulse rate) results will be interp reted 
locally by the investigator or qualified designee and documented in the patient’s medical records. 
8.1.6. Comprehensive Skin Evaluation  
A comprehensive skin evaluation will be performed by the Investigator or qualified designee at 
Screening. The skin exam should include a full body skin exam (head- to-toe skin examination). 
Any concerning lesions identified during the Screening Period will be biopsied and results must 
be known to be benign prior to the first dose of setmelanotide. If the pre -treatment biopsy results 
are of concern, the patient will be excluded from the trial. Additionally, any new lesion or change in an existing lesion identified during the trial must be evaluated by a dermatologist and biopsied, if clinically indicated in the opinion of the dermatologist.  
Protection from Sun 
Skin hyperpigmentation, or tanning, was observed in the cynomolgus monkey toxicology and human trials . These events were reversible upon cessation of trial drug. However, it is still 
uncertain if exposure to sunlight might  exacerbate the tanning effects of setmelanotide. 
Therefore, patients are advised to use sunscreen and/or to wear protective clothing to avoid excessive exposure of their skin to sunlight and to avoid sun-tanning. 
8.1.7. Fitzpatrick Scale  
Each patient is to be categorized for skin type according to the Fitzpatrick scale 
(Fitzpatrick1975 ) at timepoints listed in the SoA . The Fitzpatrick Scale is presented Appendix 3.  
8.2. Efficacy Assessments  
8.2.1. Weight and Height  
Weight (kg) and height (cm) will be recorded at the time points designated in the SoA ( Table  1). 
All measurements will be done in triplicate at each time point.  
Weight should be measured after patients have attempted to empty their bladders and after 
fasting for at least 8  hours. Patients are to wear light clothing or underwear and no shoes, with 
empty pockets, and will be weighed at approximately the same time of day. All measurements 
will be recorded to the nearest 10th of a decimal place if reported with a digital scale, or half kg 
with a mechanical scale.  

Protocol RM-493- 033 V5.0 
Rhythm Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Page 43 of  63  Confidential Whenever possible, the same scale should be used throughou t the trial, including the Screening 
 visit, and should be calibrated on a regular basis per manufacturer’s speci fications.  
Patient’s weight will be monitored closely during the trial. If a patient’s weight decreases to 
below 15 kg, t he Investigator and Sponsor will discuss the patient’s status and w ill jointly 
determine if that patient should continue the current do se, decrease t he dose or discontinue 
 treatment with setmelanotide temporarily or permanently. A dose reduction to 0.25  mg QD can 
 be considered in such scenarios or in case of tolerability concerns. These d ose adjustments are 
considered adequate to help att ain and maintain  appropriate body w eight in growing pe diatric 
 patients  
Height (cm) will be measured without shoes, socks, or hats, using a wall-mounted stadiometer. 
The stadiometer should be calibrated by s ite personne l on a  daily basis prior to height 
assessment. All me asurements will be done in triplicate at each time point and recorded to the 
nearest half centimeter. Both weight and he ight measurements will be used to determine BMI 
and B MI- related assessments (i.e. , Z-score and percentiles) .

Vital signs include systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP), HR, respiration rate and body 
temperature (°C). Vital signs will be obtained in the sitting position following at least 5  minutes 
 of rest at each time point designated in the SoA ( Table  1). 
All BP and HR measurements will be taken in triplicate, approximately 2  minutes apart. When 
 possible, BP should be taken in the non -dominant arm throughout the trial, using the same

Adverse events (AEs)  will be monitored through out the trial. AEs will be recorded in the eCRFs 
 from Screening through the EOS visit . AEs that occur after the start of trial drug administration 
 will be considered treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs). Serious AEs (SAEs) will be 
 recorded through t o the EOS visit. All AEs should be monitored unt il they are resolved or are 
clearly determined to be due to a patient’s stable or chronic condition or intercurrent illness(es).  
All trial sites will be provided with the contact information of key trial personne l to be contacted 
 in case o f emergencies.  
8.6.1.  Definition of Adverse E vents  
8.6.1.1.  Adverse E vent (AE)  
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in 
humans, whether or not it is considered drug related. Patients/caregivers will be instructed to 
contact the I nvestigator at any time after a patient has been enrolled, be fore treatment, during 
 treatment, or within 30  days following the cessation of  treatment, if any symptoms develop. 
 A TEAE is defined as any event not present before expos ure to trial drug or any event already 
present that worsens in i ntensity or frequency after expos ure. 
 A suspected adverse reaction is any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility that the trial 
drug caused the AE. For the purposes of investigational new drug safety reporting, “reasonable 
possibility” means that t here is evidence to suggest a cau sal relationship between the trial drug 
 and the AE. A suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser degree of certainty about causality 
than an adverse reaction. 
An adverse reaction is any AE caused by a trial drug. Adverse r eactions belong t o a subset of all 
 suspected adverse reactions and indicate that there are reasons to conclude that the trial  drug 
caused the event.  
An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered “unexpected” if it is not listed in the 
Reference Safety Information section of the I nvestigator brochure or if it occurs with specificity 
 or severity that has not been previously obs erved with the trial drug be ing tested; or, if an 
 Investigator brochure is not required or available, the AE or suspected adverse reaction is not 
 consistent with the risk information described in the general investigational plan or elsewhere in 
PPD

Rhythm Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Page 48 of 63  Confidential the current application. For example, under this definition, hepatic necrosis would be unexpected 
(by virtue of greater severity) if the IB referred only to elevated hepatic enzymes or hepatitis. 
Similarly, cerebral thromboembolism and cerebral vasculitis would be unexpected (by virtue of greater specificity) if the IB  listed only cerebral vascular accidents. “Unexpected,” as used in this 
defin ition, also refers to AEs or suspected adverse reactions that are mentioned in the IB as 
occurring with a class of drugs or as anticipated from the pharmacological properties of the drug but are not specifically mentioned as occurring with the particular d rug under investigation. 
All AEs that occur after any patient has been enrolled, before treatment, during treatment, or 
within 30 days following the cessation of treatment, whether or not they are related to the trial, 
must be recorded on forms provided by the Sponsor. 
8.6.1.2. Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
An SAE is an AE occurring during any trial phase (i.e., baseline, treatment, washout, or follow-
up), and at any dose of the investigational product, comparator or placebo, that fulfils one or 
more of the  following criteria:  
• Results in death  
• It is immediately life -threatening  
• Note: “Life -threatening” refers to a situation in which the subject was at risk of death 
at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which might have caused death if 
it we re more severe.  
• It requires in -patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization 
• Note: AEs requiring hospital admissions that are less than 24 hours in duration do not meet this criterion. A scheduled hospitalization for a pre -existing condition that has 
not worsened during participation in the trial does not meet this criterion. Pre -planned 
hospitalizations for an elective medical/surgical procedure or routine check -ups do 
not meet this criterion.  
• It results in a persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability 
to conduct normal life functions  
• It is a congenital anomaly/birth defect 
• It is an important medical event that may jeopardize the patient or may require medical intervention to prevent one of the outcome s listed above.  
Note: Important medical events are those that may not result in death, be life threatening, or require hospitalization but may be considered serious when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject and may requ ire 
medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or 
convulsions that  do not result in inpatient hospitalization, or the development of drug 
dependency or drug abuse 
Protocol RM-493- 033 V5.0 
Rhythm Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Page 49 of 63  Confidential All SAEs that occur after any patient has been enrolled, before treatment, during treatment, or 
within 30 days following the cessation of treatment, whether or not they are related to the trial, 
must be recorded on forms provided by the Sponsor. 
8.6.2. Relationship to Trial  Drug  
A medically -qualified I nvestigator must assess the relationship of any AE (including SAEs) to 
the use of the investigational product, as related or not related, based on clinical judgment and 
using all available information, and may include consideration of the following factors: 
• Possible alternative causes of the AE, including the disease under treatment, pre-
existing conditions, concomitant use of other drugs, and presence of environmental or 
genetic factors  
• The temporal association between drug exposure and onset of the AE 
• Whether the manifestations of the AE are consistent with known actions or toxicity of the investigational product 
• Dechallenge: The AE resolved or improved with decreasing the dose or stopping use 
of the investigational product. Judgment should be used if multiple products are 
discontinued at the same time  
• Rechallenge: The AE recurred or worsened upon re- exposure to the investigational 
product. 
The causal relationship between the trial drug  and the AE will be assessed using one of the 
following categories:  
Not Related : An AE is not associated with trial drug if: 
• Temporal relationship is lacking (e.g., the event did not oc cur within a reasonable 
time frame following administration of the  trial drug); or  
• Other causative factors more likely explain the event (e.g., a pre -existing condition, 
other concomitant treatments); or  
• Dechallenge was either not clinically indicated or did not result in clinical 
improvement; or  
• AE did not reoccur upon rechallenge (if applicable). 
Related : An AE is attributed to the  trial drug  if: 
• There is a positive temporal relationship (e.g., the event occurred within a reasonable 
time frame following a dministration of trial drug ); and  
• The AE is more likely explained by the investigational product than by another cause 
(i.e., the AE shows a pattern consistent with previous knowledge of the 
investigational product or the class of the investigational product), or the event 
improved on dechallenge and/or re- occurred upon rechallenge (if applicable).  
Protocol RM-493- 033 V5.0 
Rhythm Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Page 50 of  63  Confidential 8.6.3.  Overdose  
An ove rdose is a significant variation from the recommended/scheduled dosage for a produc t. 
For this trial , an ove rdose of setmelanotide is considered a dose higher than:  
• 2 mg in any patient  
• 1.5 m g in patients with body w eight
 • 1.0 m g in patients with body w eight
 • 0.5 m g in patients with body w eight
 8.6.4.  Recording Adverse E vents  
AEs spontaneously reported by t he patient/caregiver and/or in respons e to an ope n que stion from 
the trial personne l or revealed by obs ervation w ill be recorded during the trial at the 
investigational site.  
Clinically significant changes in laboratory values, BP, and pul se need not be reported as AEs. 
However, abnorm al values that constitute an SAE or lead to discontinuation of administration of 
 trial drug must be reported and recorded as an AE. 
AEs will be recorded from obtaining consent until the end of the trial. SAE information will be 
collected from obtaining con sent until EO S. The AE term should be reported in standard medical 
 terminology when pos sible. For each AE, the Investigator will evaluate and report the onset (date 
and time), resolution (date and time), intensity, causality, action taken, serious outcome (if 
applicable), and w hether or not it caused the patient to discontinue the trial. 
Intensity will be asse ssed acco rding to the following scale:  
• Mild (awareness of sign or symptom, but easily tolerated)  
• Moderate (discomfort sufficient to cause interference with normal activities)  
• Severe (incapacitating, with inability to perform normal activities)  
It is important to distinguish between serious and severe AEs. A severe AE may not be 
considered serious. 
8.6.5.  Reporting Adverse E vents  
All AEs reported or observed dur ing the trial will be recorded on t he AE page of the eCRF. 
Information to be collected includes drug treatment, type of event, time of onset, dos age, 
Investigator- specified assessm ent of severity and relationship to trial drug, time of resolution of  
 the event, seriousness, any required treatment or evaluations, and out come. Any A Es resulting 
from concurrent illnesses, reactions to concurrent illnesses,  reactions to concurrent medications, 
or progression of  disease states must also be reported. All AEs will be followed until they are 
resolved, stable, or judge d by t he I nvestigator to be not clinically significant. The MedDRA will 
 be used to code all AEs. Any medical condition that is present at the time that the subject is 
screened but  does not deteriorate should not  be r eported as an AE. However, if it deteriorates at 
 any time during the trial, it should be recorded as an AE .

Rhythm Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Page 51 of 63  Confidential A referral to a mental health practitioner should be issued to the patient  for any instance of 
reported AEs indicative of a change in mental health status.  
8.6.6. Re porting of Expedited Safety Observations by the Investigator 
Any occurrence of the following events or outcomes in a subject in the trial must be reported 
expeditiously by the Investigator or qualified designee to the Sponsor via an SAE form: 
• SAE 
• Death of a subject  
• Overdose 
• Cancer  
The I nvestigator is to report any of the items in the list above within24 hours of becoming aware 
of the event. Any observation reported to The Sponsor that is also an AE, is to be recorded in the eCRF, as well as in th e subject's source documentation along with any actions taken. If not all 
information is available at the time of the initial report, follow -up SAE reports will be completed 
and submitted. The I nvestigator is required to follow SAEs until resolution regard less of whether 
the patients are still participating in the trial. Resolution is defined as follows: 
• Resolved with or without residual effects  
• A return to baseline for a pre -existing condition 
• The Investigator does not expect any further improvement or worsening of the event 
• Fatal outcome - If an autopsy is performed on a deceased subject, the autopsy report 
must be provided to the Sponsor as soon as it is available.

Details of all statistical analyses w ill be described in a sep arate Statistical A nalysis Plan (SAP). 
9.1. Sam ple Size Determination  
No formal sample size determination was made based on statistical inference. The sample size is 
not driven by statistical power considerations but is primarily driven by clinical and practical 
considerations. Given the rare patient popul ation, the trial plans to enroll approximately 10-
15 patients ( approximately 5 or more pediatric patients with biallelic mutations of the POMC, 
 PCSK1 or LEPR genes and approximately 5 or more pediatric patients with BBS).  
9.2. Stati stical Analyses  
The primary objective is to evaluate the effect of setmelanotide on weight -related parameters 
 measured in terms of the response rate to setmelanotide. Due to the small sample size of the trial, 
no statistical hypot hesis testing is planned, and efficacy will be reported using de scriptive 
statistics. The safety pop ulation, including all patients who receive at least 1 dos e of 
setmelanotide, will be used as the primary analysis population for all the analyses.  
AEs will be coded by pr eferre d term (PT) and system organ class (SOC) using the latest version 
 of Med DRA and summarized. All AE data will be presented in a data listing. TEAEs will be 
summa rized, including by severity and relationship to trial drug. Serious AEs and A Es leading to 
early discontinuation will also be presented in data listings.  
Actual values and changes from baseline for clinical laboratory test results, vital sign 
measurements etc. will be summarized using descriptive statistics (N, mean, standard deviation, 
median, minimum, and maximum). Shift tables will be generated for clinical laboratory test 
results. Clinical laboratory test results, vital sign measurements etc. will be presented in data 
listings.

10.1. Trial  Monitoring  
During the trial, a monitor from The Sponsor or designee will have regular contacts with the 
investigational site, for the following: 
• Provide information and support to the Investigator(s) and site staff 
• Confirm that facilities remain acceptable  
• Confirm that the investigational team is adhering to the protocol, that data are being 
accurately recorded in the case report forms, and that investigational product 
accountability checks are being performed  
• Perform s ource data verification. This includes a comparison of the data in the case 
report forms with the patient’s medical records at the hospital or practice, and other records relevant to the trial. This will require direct access to all original records for 
each patient ( e.g., clinic charts).  
• Record and report any protocol deviations not previously sent to The Sponsor 
• Confirm AEs and SAEs have been properly documented on eCRFs and confirm any 
SAEs have been forwarded to The Sponsor and those SAEs that met crite ria for 
reporting have been forwarded to the IRB. 
The monitor will be available between  monitoring  visits if the Investigator(s) or other staff needs 
information or  advice. 
10.1.1. Trial  Conduct During the COVID -19 Pandemic  
The worldwide Coronavirus Disease 2019 ( COVID-19) pandemic may impact the conduct of 
clinical trials  due to the challenges from quarantines, site closures, travel limitations, and other 
considerations if site personnel or patients become potentially exposed to or infected with COVID-19. To assur e the safety of patient s, maintain compliance with GCP, and minimize risks 
to trial integrity, if necessary, in consultation with the Sponsor, the method of assessment may be changed (e.g., paper assessments replaced by electronic assessments). In addition, site visits may be replaced with telephone, internet-based video‑ conferencing applications, or home visits by 
qualified health care professionals. Normal procedures, as detailed in this protocol, will be resumed as soon as possible thereafter.  
More detailed guidance on trial conduct during the COVID-19 pandemic is provided in 
Appendix 2. 
10.2. Audits and Inspections  
Authorized representatives of the Sponsor, a regulatory authority, an IRB or IEC may visit the 
site to pe rform audits or inspections, including source data verification. The purpose of a 
Sponsor audit or inspection is to systematically and independently examine all trial-related 
activities and documents to determine whether these activities were conducted, and data were recorded, analyzed, and accurately reported according to the protocol, GCP guidelines of the 
International Council for Harmonisation (ICH),  and any applicable regulatory requirements. The 

Protocol RM-493- 033 V5.0 
Rhythm Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Page 54 of 63  Confidential Investigator should contact the Sponsor immediately if c ontacted by a regulatory agency about 
an inspection. 
10.3. Institutional Review Board (IRB) or Independent Ethics Committee 
(IEC)  
The Investigator must obtain IRB/IEC approval for the investigation. Initial IRB/IEC approval, 
and all materials  approved by the IRB /IEC for this trial including the written consent form and 
recruitment materials must be maintained by the Investigator and made available for inspection.  
10.4. Source Documents 
Source documents provide evidence for the existence of the patient and substantiate the integrity 
of the data collected. Source documents are filed at the Investigator’s site. Data entered in the eCRF that are transcribed from source documents must be consistent with the source documents 
or the discrepancies must be explained. The Investigator may need to request previous medical 
records or transfer of records, depending on the trial. Also, current medical records must be 
available.  
Any electronic trial data are to be entered into a secure, validated data processing system and a backup maintained. Any changes to electronic trial data will be documented.

12.1. Ethics Review  
The final trial  protocol, including the final version of the written consent , must be approved or 
given a favorable opinion in writing by an IRB or IEC as appropriate. The Investigator must 
submit written approval to the Sponsor before he or she can enroll any patient into the trial. 
The Investigator is responsible for informing the  IRB or IEC of any amendment to the protocol 
in accordance with local requirements. In addition, the IRB or IEC must approve all advertising used to recruit patients for the trial. The protocol must be re-approved by the IRB or IEC upon 
receipt of amendmen ts and annually, as local regulations require. 
The Investigator is also responsible for providing the IRB or IEC with reports of any reportable 
serious adverse drug reactions from any other trial  conducted with the investigational product. 
The Sponsor will provide this information to the Investigator.  
Progress reports and notifications of serious adverse drug reactions will be provided to the IRB or IEC according to local regulations and guidelines. 
12.2. Ethical Conduct of the Trial  
The trial will be performed i n accordance with ethical principles that have their origin in the 
Declaration of Helsinki and are consistent with ICH/GCP, applicable regulatory requirements 
and the Sponsor’s policy on Bioethics. 
12.3. Written Informed Consent 
The Investigator(s) at each site  will ensure that the patient and their legal guardian are given full 
and adequate oral and written information about the nature, purpose, possible risk and benefit of 
the trial. Patients and their legal guardian(s) must also be notified that they are free to 
discontinue from the trial at any time. The patient s and their legal guardian(s) should be given 
the opportunity to ask questions and allowed time to consider the information provided. 
The parent/legal guardian(s) signed and dated consent must be obtained before conducting any 
trial procedures.  
The Investigator(s) must maintain the original, signed consent. A signed copy of the consent must be given to the parent/legal guardian(s).

Rhythm Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Page 57 of 63  Confidential 13. DATA HANDLING AND RECORDKEEPING  
13.1. Inspection of Records 
The Sponsor will be allowed to conduct site visits to the investigate facilities for monitoring any 
aspect of the trial. The Investigator agrees to allow the monitor to inspect the drug storage area, trial drug stocks, drug accountability records, patient charts and trial so urce documents, and other 
records relative to trial conduct. 
13.2. Retention of Records 
The Investigator must maintain all documentation relating to the trial for a period of 2  years after 
the last marketing application approval, or if not approved 2 years follo wing the discontinuance 
of the test article for investigation. If it becomes necessary for the Sponsor or the Regulatory 
Authority to review any documentation relating to the trial, the Investigator must permit access 
to such records. 
13.3. Data Protection 
Any patient records or data sets transferred to the Sponsor will contain the  trial identifier only; 
patient names or any information which would make the patient identifiable will not be 
transferred.  
The patient must be informed that his/her personal trial- related data will be used by the Sponsor 
in accordance with local data protection law. The level of disclosure must also be explained to the patient who will be required to give consent for their data to be used as described in the informed consent. 
The patien t must be informed that his/her medical records may be examined by Clinical Quality 
Assurance auditors or other authorized personnel appointed by the Sponsor, by appropriate IRB 
or IEC members, and by inspectors from regulatory authorities. 
13.4. Data Quality As surance 
All patient data relating to the trial will be recorded on printed or eCRF unless transmitted to the Sponsor electronically (e.g., electronic diary). The Investigator is responsible for verifying that 
data entries are accurate and correct by physically or electronically signing the eCRF.  
The Investigator must maintain accurate documentation (source data) that supports the 
information entered in the eCRF. 
The Investigator must permit trial-related monitoring, audits, IRB review and regulatory agency 
inspections and provide direct access to source data documents. 
Monitoring details describing strategy (e.g., risk-based initiatives in operations and quality such 
as Risk Management and Mitigation Strategies and Analytical Risk -Based Monitoring), methods, 
responsibilities and requirements, including handling of noncompliance issues and monitoring 
techniques (central, remote or on -site monitoring) are provided in the Monitoring Plan. 
The Sponsor or designee is responsible for the data management of this trial  including quality 
checking of the data. 
Protocol RM-493- 033 V5.0 
Rhythm Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Page 58 of 63  Confidential The Sponsor assumes accountability for actions delegated to other individuals (e.g., Contract 
Research Organizations).  
Trial monitors will perform ongoing source data verification to confirm that data entered into the 
eCRF by authorized site personnel are accurate, complete, and verifiable from source documents; that the safety and rights of patients are being protected; and th at the trial is being conducted in 
accordance with the currently approved protocol and any other trial agreements, ICH GCP, and all applicable regulatory requirements.  
In an exceptional case where a local restriction for the on -site Monitoring Visit at the  
investigator site is implemented (e.g., due to COVID -19), the Clinical Research Associate (CRA)  
will perform routine scheduled Remote Interim Monitoring Visits (rIMV) for active sites. The aim of the remote activities is to ensure adequate ongoing oversight of trial activities to identify 
and eliminate any immediate risk to the safety and integrity of the patients. Each individual 
rIMV  should be approved by the Sponsor on a case-by- case basis.  
There are 5  types of rIMV that may be performed, where approved by the relevant local 
authorities, which include:  
• Remote Source Data Monitoring (rSDM) visits: The CRA will verify data remotely, off site if unable to be at the site. The Site coordinator will show the CRA source data 
via Zoom or alternate teleconference portal.  
• Remote Data Verification visits: The CRA will verify source data remotely, off- site if 
unable to be at the site.  
• Audio Data Verification visits: An alternative approach for remote data verification 
of critical patient data, when Monitor asks an In vestigator site staff member to read 
patient source documents during a telephone call while reviewing the eCRF to verify 
patient safety is protected and the data reported by Investigator (e.g., in the eCRF) is 
accurate and complete. 
• Video Source Data Monitoring visits: Process for conducting rSDM during a video 
call/conference between the Monitor and Investigator site staff member, when the 
Investigator site staff member shares the patient source documents with the Monitor via camera so that the Monitor can  perform Source Data Review and Source Data 
Verification as per the project -specific instructions.  
• Remote Site Monitoring Contact visits: the CRA will attend the site to review the investigator site file ( ISF), investigative product ( IP) supply, etc. 
Depen ding on the local regulation, some of these types of rIMV may be allowed or not. 
Records and documents, including signed informed consent forms, pertaining to the conduct of this trial  must be retained by the Investigator for at least 2  years after the last marketing 
application approval or 2 years after formal discontinuation of the clinical development of the investigational product or according to applicable regulatory requirement(s). If the Investigator withdraws from the responsibility of keeping the trial records, custody must be transferred to a 
person willing to accept the responsibility. The Sponsor must be notified immediately by telephone or e-mail and the notification confirmed in writing if a custodial change occurs.

COVID- 19 PANDEMIC 
The COVID -19 pandemic could impact the conduct of this clinical trial for several reasons, 
including: self-isolation/quarantine by patients and trial- site personnel; travel restrictions/limited 
access to public places, including hospitals; and reassignment of site personnel to critical tasks.  
In accordance with recent healt h authority guidance, the Sponsor is providing temporary 
considerations for trial conduct in the event of disruption of the trial. This guidance does not 
supersede any local or government requirements or the clinical judgment of the Investigator. If at 
any time a patient’s safety is considered to be at risk, trial intervention will be discontinued, and 
trial follow -up will be conducted. 
If COVID-19 restrictions are imposed on or by the trial site and the site cannot fully carry out 
normal operations, the following measures are recommended on a temporary basis during the 
COVID- 19 pandemic:  
• Where possible, every effort should be made to complete all protocol-required 
assessments. In place of a required site visit, a qualified healthcare provider could 
perform trial -related procedures as per the SoA  (Table  1) via a home visit, including 
but not limited to collection of body weight, vital signs, physical examinations, 
ECGs, recording of AEs, collection of blood and urine samples. Most efficacy 
assessments could potentially be done off site. Investigators should use their clinical judgment to determine whether a patient can continue trial treatment in the absenc e of 
on-site clinic visits or consider alternatives such as temporary treatment interruption 
or trial discontinuation. 
• All protocol -required assessments missed due to COVID -19 restrictions should be 
documented in detail within the patients’ source documents and should be clearly designated as “COVID -19 RELATED”. It must be documented if a site visit is 
instead conducted remotely. Source documentation should detail how each 
assessment was collected (e.g., remote vs. on -site, central vs. local laborat ory, vital 
signs taken at home by caretaker vs. delegated in -home nursing, etc.). 
• If applicable, discontinuations of trial interventions and withdrawal from the trial due 
to disruption of trial conduct by the pandemic should be documented with the prefix 
“COVID- 19 RELATED” in the CRF.  
COVID- 19 Infection in Trial  Patients : 
There are currently no available data suggesting that patients treated with setmelanotide should have treatment interrupted during the COVID-19 pandemic. If a patient develops symptoms associated with coronavirus infection, it is recommended to confirm the diagnosis using locally 
approved laboratory kits and report it to the local health authorities, as required. Patients with 
positive test results for SARS -CoV-2 should have this recorded as an AE, and if hospitalized, 
this should be reported as a SAE.

 1 RESEARCH PLAN  
1.1 Summary  
We propose to test our central hypothesis that readmission and post -discharge utilization in high risk 
medical and surgical patients can be reduced by using a vendor platform  (PinpointIQ from the company 
physIQ)  that involves wearable sensors  (Vital Patch)  that collect real-time, continuous ambulatory vital 
signs , a mobile device that collects patient reported outcomes  and machine learning algorithms in the 
clou d that identify patients at risk of physiologic perturbation . Data from t his vendor platform will be tied 
to operational workflows at NorthShore that involve a monitoring nurse  who then conveys information 
to the clinical team  as necessary in a cascading a lert system .  
1.2 Background and Significance  
Hospital r eadmissions  are common and costly and are increasingly being used as a metric for quality care. 
With the passing of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) hospital readmissions were targeted with the Hospital 
Read mission Reduction Program (HRRP) in which hospitals are penalized for higher than expected 
readmission rate s.1 Significant effort has been devoted to understanding how to reduce readmissions  and 
utilization . To date there has been limited work looking at how wearable  sensors  that monitor physiologic 
data continuously  and remotely  can identify  physiologic perturbation allowing care providers ample time 
to intervene and prevent decompensation and readmission.  
Monitoring of vital signs for hospitalized patien ts to detect decompensation is checked manually and 
intermittently  (spot check)  for the majority of patients. When patients are discharged , vital signs are 
frequently  not monitored  in the 30-day readmission window . This lack of monitoring in the post disch arge 
period may prevent identification of patients at risk of decompensation and readmission.  When spot vitals 
are monitored at home , reductions in readmission rates for certain populations have been seen.2-4   
New technology in wearables coupled with machine learning algorithms is able to detect vital signs 
remotely and continuously and correlate the output with signals that may indicate risk of physiologic 
perturbation.5-17 Various studies have looked at how continuous monitoring  of vital s can identify patients 
in the hospital quicker  and more effectively  than nurse driven  spot checks of  vital signs .18-28 There is a lack 
of data on using these devices upon discharge to evaluate for decompensation and prospectively trying 
to reduce readmiss ions.  Similarly, t here is a lack of  data in tying these devices to a cascading and escalating 
alert system  to identify patients at risk of decompensation . There is qualitative data on looking at how 
wearables are perceived by providers and patients in the hospital29-30 but there is a lack of data on 
perception of this technology for remote monitoring.  
Postoperative ileostomy patients are frequently readmitted because of physiologic perturbation31-35 and 
has readmission rates between 15 -30% at NorthShore. Ileostomy patients are readmitted because of 
dehydration.33-35 There has been early work establishing the predictive potential of m ultivariate 
physiological telemetry (pinpointIQ) from a wearable sensor providing accurate early detection of 
impending rehos pitalization for postoperative ileostomy  with a predictive accuracy comparable to 
implanted devices . 39 This population may benefit from remote continuous monitoring of vital signs tied 
to a cascading alert system to identify patients at risk of impending  decompensation.   There is limited 
literature looking at how continuous monitoring , ambulatory  wearable devices can improve outcomes in 
high risk patients.  
5 
 We propose conducting a mixed -method s study that will use a wearable device to collect ambulatory 
physiological data analyzed by a machine -learning algorithm to identify readmission risk. The alerts will 
be tied to a cascading escalation pathway that involves monitoring nurse , mid -level providers, specialists, 
and surgeons. We describe the quantitative and qualitative aspects of the study in detail below.

 2 QUANTITATIVE  
 
2.1 Quantitative Research Aims – Ileostomy Cohort  
 
Aim 1: Determine if wearable technology deployed for 30 days in a high -risk patient population can 
augment 30 -day readmission risk prediction and improve care processes via an escalating feedback 
protocol.  
Aim 2: Understand and finalize thresholds and criteria for alert system at the levels of Vital Patch, 
physIQ’s pinpointIQ, monitoring  RNs for ileostomy patients  
Aim 3: Finalize process maps and workflows for nurse navigators  and clinical care teams that optimize 
identifying high risk patients while minimizing provider burden  
 
Aim 4: Calculate the return on investment of the re mote monitoring solution  
Aim 5: Perform a deep analysis of the full process to understand effectiveness, feasibility, efficiency and 
bottlenecks  
2.2 Experimental Plan and Methods  
The goal of the study is to reduce readmission rates  for high risk medical and surgical patients . The goal 
of the study  is to understand how physIQ’s platform Pinpoint IQ with a cascading set of alerts including 
the wearable device alerts, patient reported metrics, CAPE navigator or monitoring nurse  alerts can be 
developed and improved upon to reduce the incidence of 30 day readmission. We will be enrolling  10 
colorectal (post ileostomy formation) patients w ho will be using a standardized set of cascading alerts 
that have been fine tuned with the goal of re ducing decompensation and 30-day readmissions.  
Ileostomy  
For the c olorectal patients , we will attempt to e nroll every patient that has a colectomy followed by 
ileostomy formation. These will be patients of Drs. Joseph Muldoon, Monika Krezalek , and James  Spitz 
and will be at Evanston, Glenbrook , and Highland Park hospitals . The colorectal surgeons will notify the 
study team when a patient has undergone surgery and the research coordinator will perform 
recruitment . Patients will be approached by the study coo rdinator who will perform informed consent. 
If the patient is agreeable the patient will receive a kit from physIQ prior to discharge. A Vital patch will 
be placed on the patient prior to discharge and the patch will be connected via blue tooth to the phys IQ 
mobile device and pinpointIQ application. The study coordinator will teach the patient how to apply and 
remove the patch and what to do if there are issues with the patch. The study coordinator will also 
teach the patient how to use the mobile device an d the physIQ application. This will also occur 
immediately prior to discharge.  
On discharge colorectal patients will be asked questions every morning and every afternoon from the 
pinpoint IQ application.  The pintpoint  IQ platform will query patients about their ostomy output every 
7 
 morning . We would also  ask if the patient has any infectious symptoms such as fever, discharge or 
redness around the incision site or stoma and if the patient has any dehydration symptoms suc h as 
decreased urine output, dark urine , or obstruction and other alarming symptoms that the team would 
like to know about . In the afternoon,  the symptom questions  will be asked again . The monitoring nurse  
will evaluate the pinpoint IQ in the morning after  the patient has filled out the questionnaire  and in the 
afternoon after the patient has filled out the symptom  question again . They will evaluate the responses 
to the questions and the physiologic alerting system built by physIQ. There will again be an al gorithm 
built within physIQ’s system that provides an alert to the monitoring nurse  if the criteria from Table 4 
are met.  
 
 
physIQ Alert System – Ileostomy  
Patients:  

8 
 Any positive symptom (dehydration ,infection , or obstruction ) 
≥1200 ml ostomy output over one day  
A high risk alert  
A predefined number of standard alerts in a day  
Table 4: PhysIQ alerts system for CAPE navigator or monitoring nurse  for Ileostomy  
 
For ileostomy the thresholds for the high -risk alerts and the number of standard alerts may be changed 
from patient to patient based on how each case progresses and the density and frequency of alerts. 
Determining the optimal thresholds for these two types of alerts will be a key aim of this study  The goal 
is again maximizing signal while minimizing noise.  
 
If any of these conditions listed in Table  4 are met the monitoring nurse  will call the patient and go 
through a predefined note with the following data elements and questions.

Table 5: CAPE Navigator or monitoring nurse  alerts system for clinical team for Ileostomy  
Table 5 will be configured into a note template within EPIC that allows for data elements to be captured  
and have all the logics built in to automatically highlight the recommended options for the monitoring 
nurse . The EHR smart note will be tested out by the res earch team to ensure the logic is correct.  
 
If patients have any high risk alerts (MCI, Afib with RVR, Tachycardia, Tachypnea), the monitoring nurse  
will route a note and call clinical RN and evaluate the trend of ostomy output. All other physiological al erts 
will result in consideration  call to clinical RN.  
 
If patient ostomy output >1200cc and patient not on stool thickening regimen yet, the monitoring nurse  
will send note and call clinical RN,  consider IV fluids administration and start stool thickenin g regimen 
escalation. Monitoring  RNs will call cinical RNs for guidance on IV fluid administration guidance. The stool 
regimen escalation can occur daily while the output is ≥1200ml in 24 hours. There is no monitoring nurse  
de-escalation protocol, and this  will be performed by the clinical team. If a patient is non -adherent to 
Metamucil and/or Imodium  and output is ≥1200ml in 24 hours , medications will be maintained without 
escalation and patient will be counseled on the importance of adherence to medications. If the output 
continues to be greater than ≥1200ml in 24 hours and there are no further options for escalation , the 
monitoring nurse  will call the clinical care team for further guidance.  
 
If ostomy output is <500cc, monitoring nurse  will rou te note and call clinical RN. If pati ent has any new or 
worsening obstruction symptom but not NPO  yet, monitoring nurse  will route note and call clinical RN, 
and consider lab tests (BMP, Mag, Phos). If the obstructive symptoms resolve while patient is NPO,  home 
healrh RNs will route not to clinical RN.  
If patient has new or worsening obstruction symptoms but is NPO already,  monitoring nurse  will note and 
call clinical RN, consider lab tests (BMP, Mag, Phos), and continue NPO status.  If patient obstruction 
12 
 symptom is stable or improving under the NPO status, monitoring nurse  will keep patient NPO. If patient 
has resolved obstructive symptoms, still NPO and ostomy output is >1200 cc or between 500 -1200 cc, 
monitoring nurse  will note and call clinical RN, and i nstruct patients to advance diet as tolerated.  
 
Any new  or worsening redness at ostomy site, drainage or swelling at ostomy site,  but patient not on 
antibiotics , monitoring nurse  will note and call the ostomy RN  for guidance in management , and consider 
CBC labs. If the above symptoms resolve without antibiotics, home healrh RN will call ostomy RN to 
update.  
 
If patient has new or worsening redness at ostomy stite, drainage or swelling at ostomy site, and is already 
on antibiotics, home healrh RNs will note and call ostomy RN, consider CBC labs and urgent clinic 
evaluation. If above symptoms resolve with antibiotics, home healrh RN will call ostomy RN.  
 
Any new, worsening, improved or stable  fever, dysuria or other infectious symptoms, but patient not on 
antibiotics,  the monitoring nurse  will note and call clinical RNs, and consider CBC labs. If the above 
symptoms resolve without antibiotics, the  monitoring nurse  will route note to clinical RN.  
 
If patient has any new, worsening, improved or stable fever, dysu ria or other infectious symptoms, but is 
already on antibiotics , the monitoring nurse  will note and call clinical RNs, and consider CBC labs  and 
urgent clinic visits . If the above symptoms resolve with antibiotics, the monitoring nurse  will route note 
to clinical RN.  
 
If patient has new or worsening dehydration symptoms, but not NPO, monitoring nurse  will note and call 
clinical RN, consider IV fluids administration, and consider labs (BMP, Mag, Phos) . If the dehydration 
symptoms are stable or improving whil e patient is not NPO, the home healrh nurses will route note to 
clinical RN, consider call clinical RN, and consider IV fluids administration under guidance of clinical team. 
When dehydration symptoms resolve, the home healrh RNs will route note to clinica l RN.  
 
We will be evaluating the high risk alerts and other physiological alerts to find the optimal alert types, 
thresholds and alerting frequency to maximize signal and minimize noise.

Figure 2: Process map for Ileostomy Patient s  
 
If care is escalated to the clinical care team which includes ostomy RNs, clinical RNs , and Physicians, the 
care team will pursue various interventions including counseling, altering medication therapy such as 
antibiotic therapy, procedures such as debride ment  or drainage , urgent visits to the colorectal surgery 
clinic ideally within 72 hours , and if no other available options readmission. These workflows will be left 

14 
 to the discretion of the clinical care team given the nuance in taking care of these high -risk patients and 
the existing relationship and prior history with these providers. There are some standardized workflows 
that will be followed by the care team that are of note. Infusions of IV fluids will occur if the patient has 
≥1200 ml of ileostomy ou tput and dehydration symptoms. If these symptoms are identified , the goal will 
be to have monitoring nurse  perform infusion at the patient’s home . Also, all messaging from the 
monitoring nurses  will be forwarded to the colorectal/ileostomy  pool per protoco l and logic in Table 5 to 
create the most rapid response back to the patient if required.  
The final specs of the study will include : 
1. Optimal inclusion/exclusion criteria.  
2. Specific thresholds for high risk alerts for each use case  
3. Specific thresholds for standard alerts (likely use physIQ standard thresholds)  
4. Finalized physIQ alerts to CAPE navigators and monitoring nurse  
5. Finalized CAPE navigator and monitoring nurse  alerts to clinical care team  
6. Finalized EPIC note  
7. Finalized proces s maps  
8. Finalized workflows by clinical care team  
9. Discussion with physIQ to optimize the pinpointIQ portal to best support the CAPE navigators 
and monitoring nurse   
 
The recruitment goals  for this study is 10  ileostomy patients  each for 30d of monitoring to evaluate if 
the remote monitoring technology from physIQ and cascading alert system and process can reduce 30 -
day readmissions. We will also perform economic calculations to determine if there is return on 
investment for this  workflow  tied to remote monitoring. Finally, we would like to do a n in-depth  analysis 
of the process to understand effectiveness, feasibility, efficiency,  and bottlenecks. Some of the 
questions we would like to understand include : 1) W hat component of the  cascading alert system 
provides the highest effectiveness of identifying patients at risk ? 2) Can we reduce the number of 
monitored days and still effectively reduce 30 days of readmission?  3) Are there specific subgroups of 
patients who may benefit from the remote monitoring solution , or alternatively, are there subgroups 
who do not benefit from the remote monitoring solution?  4) Can we take our process maps and perform 
process simulation  with data from the study  and process mining to optimize our process and identify 
chokepoints with our current flow.

 3 QUALITATIVE  
3.1 Qualitative Research  Aims  
Receive provider and patient feedback on the application of wearable technology to post -discharge care 
to conduct a theory -driven evaluation of feasibility, usability, and effectiveness. We will address 
motivational and self -care issues at baseline, continuing and post -study from both providers and patients' 
viewpoints.  1) ascertain perceptions of telemonitoring and remote patie nt management of high -risk 
patients, of organization and effectiveness of care by providers using interviews and surveys; and 2) 
evaluate patient acceptance, perceptions of and satisfaction with wearable patches, with prompted 
requests for patient status i nformation, and with escalation pathways for nurse navigators and physicians 
using interviews and survey tools.  
3.2 Experimental Plan and Methods  
We will assess remote monitoring combined with non -invasive wearable technology's potential by 
applying the Affect ive Adaptation of the Technology Acceptance Model (A/TAM).52 We describe the 
approach to providers and patients in detail below. We stress that these will be linked to care delivery 
processes and the measures described above in the quantitative section to realize the full potential of a 
mixed -methods approach.  
I.  Ascertain providers' perceptions of telemonitoring and remote patient management of 
high -risk patients, organization, and effectiveness of care using interviews and surveys.  
Provider induction (prior to patient enrolment):  Provider induction will include an in -depth review of the 
wearable device, remote management, and escalation pathway, followed by an interview informed by 
A/TAM to establish each provider's comfort level (i) with wearable tech nology and any experience of such 
a device (e.g., habitual use of wrist -worn activity monitoring), and (ii) with wearable technology as a 
means of monitoring a post -discharge patient's status, including (iii) anticipated challenges in technology -
mediated i nteraction with patients; and finally (iv) identification of any knowledge gaps that may need to 
be filled through the induction process.  
Provider progress monitoring (throughout the trial period): Providers' progress and experience of the 
program will be assessed through: (a) a survey including open -ended questions with each provider 
following the completion of the study , to evaluate the extent to which anticipated issues and challenges 
may be realized. (b) a partly randomized, recurring opportunity to res pond to one question once at the 
point of interaction with the patient; based on a matrix of questions, patients and providers, a single 
multiple choice question appears as part of a best practice alert to ensure that it is seamlessly integrated; 
neverthel ess, collectively, all questions, all providers and all patients will receive adequate coverage.  
Provider satisfaction (after the trial):  At the conclusion of the study, providers: (a) will be debriefed 
through a comprehensive semi -structured interview to assess (i) their subjective perception of the 
effectiveness of wearable -mediated, post -discharge care; and (ii) actual challenges encountered in the 
course of the program (e.g., frequency of interaction, patients' comprehension of instructions, perception 
of patients' adherence, including any socio -emotional issues that may be impinging); (b) will participate 
in a post -trial half -day event to network with patients and the research team towards an open -ended 
16 
 evaluation of the joint experience and to elicit o pinions and contributions towards a follow -up randomized 
clinical trial proposal, and (c) will be invited to contribute to one or more joint evaluative publications.  
A timeline illustrating provider related study activities can be found in Figure 4.
 
Figur e 4 Provider Interview Timeline  
II. To evaluate patients’ acceptance, perceptions of and satisfaction with wearable patches, 
with prompted requests for patient status information, and with escalation pathways for 
nurse navigators, midlevel providers and specialists .  
Patient enrollment (prior to discharge ): Following a detailed presentation of the device and study, and 
informed consent, researchers will administer a questionnaire to establish the participant’s comfort and 
experience level with a wearable device and to ascertain that the participant has under stood the 
limitations of the devices (e.g. that they provide continual but not constant, “real -time” monitoring) prior 
to hospital discharge. This will be followed by an in -person semi -structured interview The interview is 
informed by A/TAM to establish the  patient’s readiness to use a wearable device as a means of monitoring 
their post -discharge status, including to establish any anticipated challenges in technology -mediated 
interaction with the care team; and finally, to identify any knowledge gaps that ma y need to be filled 
through the induction process. Paradata will be collected at the interview to assist with analysis.  
Patient progress (throughout the period of device use):  Monitoring of the patient’s experience and 
satisfaction with the device and the  study process will be combined with weekly monitoring questions 
focusing on the following aspects:  (a) experience with physical use and tolerance of the device; assess any 
difficulty in keeping it in place, any skin reaction, possible somatization of heal th concerns; (b) experience 
of self -monitoring and communication with care team through the device (c) degree of reassurance or 
anxiety about the patient’s recovery process; finally, (e) paradata from device and interaction metrics, 
including possible sent iment analysis of interaction text.  
Conclusion ( Study endpoint ): (a) Surveys will be administered at study endpoint to assess each patient’s 
strength of feeling in each response by recording not only the response itself but also the “paradata” —
the research er’s assessment of the patient’s affect in providing the response. On this basis,  (b) in Prior to

 conjunction with process measures captured through surveys, the first patient group participants will 
complete a post -study interview with the researcher. Using a mixe d methods philosophy, the interview 
will seek links between performance measures and the experience of participants. (c) The interview will 
link to the quantitative results in terms of outcome and process measures, as well as to the patient status 
reports throughout the 30 -day period to propose hypotheses for further study, e.g. on subjective 
tolerability of the wearable device or faith in a remote monitoring system and care process measures, 
such as unscheduled visits.  (d) Patients will be invited to a pos t-trial half day event to network with their 
providers and the research team towards an open -ended evaluation of the joint experience and to elicit 
opinions and contributions towards a follow -up randomized clinical trial proposal; and  (e) will be invited 
to contribute to a publication on the patient experience and to review scientific publications by the 
research team.   
For the ileostomy cohort, we will use think -aloud methods to compliment the semi -structured interviews 
during the study end -point intervie w. Patients will think -aloud and convey their thoughts and experience 
to interviewer while using the patch, phone, and physIQ app. The other topics during study end -point will 
continue with the semi -structured formats.

 The Self-Care  Self-Efficacy  Scale  – The Self-Care  Self-Efficacy  Scale  is authored  by Dr. Barbara  Riegel . 
Confidence  is not part of self-care  per se, but a factor  that greatly  influences  self-care.  For this reason,  
Dr. Riegel  include  a confidence  (or self-efficacy)  scale  as part of the self-care  scales.  The Self-Care  
Confidence  scale  can be used  alone.  
 
Stom a Quality of Life Scale  – The QOL instrument is a 21 -item questionnaire that mesures work/social 
function, secuality/body image, and stoma function.  
Device User Experience  – These questions ask about patient’s experience on using the vital patch and 
physI Q platform.  
Telemonitoring Experience  – These questions ask about patient’s experience the telemonitoring process.  
3.3.2 Provider  
The survey and interview questions for the provider cohort are developed based on A/TAM to elicit 
information. An example of the pot ential survey and interview questions the research team will use 
during the interview can be found in the appendices as Appendix 2.

 Device User Experience  – These questions ask about providers’ experience on using the physIQ platform. 
We developed this questionnaire based on the systematic usability scale (SUS).  
Telemonitoring User Experience – These questions ask about providers’ experience in the telemonitoring 
process.  
3.4 Interview methods  
Semi -structured individual interviews will be used to maximize depth of detail and minimize bias 
introduced with cross -contami nation from other interviewees .53 Researchers trained in semi -structured 
interview techniques will conduct the interviews. They will use a nondirective interview style, with open -
ended questions, and allow the participant to adopt their own pace and style of response, along with 
freedom of  subject matter, so that they may change and emphasize alternate points to those already 
brought up by the interviewer.  We will use probes and follow -up questions when indicated, and new 
constructs and ideas will be allowed to emerge.  The interviewer may  take notes during interviews, but 
de-identified transcriptions will be the primary source for analysis.  
3.5 Codebook Development  
The research team will develop study codebook based on the A/TAM theory:  
1. Codes will be generated from the A/TAM theory.  
2. Research ers will review and revise the code in context of the data.  
3. Researchers will determine the reliability of coders and the code  
3.6 Analyses  
We will complete a systematic analysis of interview transcripts to identify specific themes guided by the 
A/TAM to inform  future implementations of the wearable device and cascading alert system.  After the 
initial few interviews have been completed, two researchers, working independently, will use a 
codebook of constructs adapted from the A/TAM to identify significant phras es that exemplify each 
construct.  They will then independently review each other’s work and come together to discuss 
differences of opinion and achieve consensus.  The principal investigator will meet with the coders to 
review the codes, adding or consoli dating as warranted.  The researchers will then continue to perform 
interviews, adding codes to the codebook as needed, and meeting as a team periodically to review the 
codes and achieve consensus.  We will use Atlas TI qualitative data analysis software t o manage data 
and assist in analysis.  Finally, we will create an overview description of the important themes, and their 
relationship to A/TAM constructs.

24 
 4.2.2 Providers  
All members of the clinical care team staff will be asked to participate in the implementation of the 
project. We will include clinical team involved in the caring for ileostomy patients. We will recruit a total 
of 10 provider s to participate in the semi -structured interviews.  
4.3 Informed Consent Procedure  
4.3.1 Patients  
The research coordinator is responsible for explaining the study to potential and willing participants. The 
consent process begins once the participant is interested in being enrolled in the study.  At this time, the 
research coordinator will conduct a thorough review of the consent details, including study procedure, 
risks, confidentiality, etc. with the potential participants. Participants will be given adequate time to 
think about their decision t o participate without under coercion on the part of the researchers. Whether 
a patient wishes or not, to be enrolled, that patient’s medical care will not be affected. No consent will 
be completed if the participants have unanswered questions, and potentia l participants may talk over 
the details with the consent with whomever they wish, prior to giving consent.  
Participants will need to be consented in a face -to-face meeting with the research coordinator and if 
they wish to obtain a copy of the consent, th ey are free to do so. If there is a change in the consent 
during ongoing study activities, the participant may be asked to re -consent, if changes will have a direct 
effect on the participant.  
The research coordinator is responsible for explaining the stud y to potential and willing participants or 
to their Legally Authorized Representative (LAR). The consent process begins once the participant is 
interested in being enrolled in the study. At this time, the research coordinator will conduct a thorough 
review  of the consent details, including study procedure, risks, confidentiality, etc. with the potential 
participants or if applicable, with their LAR. Participants will be given adequate time to think about their 
decision to participate without coercion on the  part of the researchers. Whether a patient wish to be 
enrolled, that patient's medical care will not be affected. No consent will be completed if the 
participants have unanswered questions, and potential participants may talk over the details with the 
consent with whomever they wish prior to giving consent.   
Participants or when applicable, their LAR will need to consent in a face -to-face meeting with the 
research coordinator. If there is a change in the consent during ongoing study activities, the participant 
may be asked to re -consent if changes will directly affect the participant.   
 
If the participant cannot provide informed consent but are interested in the study, their LAR can sign the 
form on their behalf. The research coordinator will answer all study -related questions and communicate 
all study details before signing the consent form. In addition, the research coordinator will file all legal 
documents confirming LAR’s relation to the participant in the study binder.   
25 
 During patient recruitmen t, if any of theapproached  eligible  patient s expresses interest in the study but 
is unwilling to participate in interviews, the research coordinator will present the no -inter view consent 
form to patients  as an alternative option . Once the no -interview gro up is full, patients will only be 
presented the consent form with interviews.  
 
As part of the informed consent process:  
1. The participant agrees to wear a total of 5 VCI VitalPatch for 7 days each adding up to 35 
total days of monitoring . The research coordi nator will place the VitalPatch on patients 
when they are still hospitalized.  Our goal is to collect 30 days of post -discharge data.  
2. The participant agrees to replace the VitalPatch every 7 days and to answer survey 
questions either daily (in the morning) or twice a day for the duration of the study  in a 
timely fashion  
3. The participant agrees to follow directions on the pinpointIQ application  
4. The participant agrees to allow access to basic demographics, medical conditions, wearable 
and pinpointIQ platform data, other vital signs, medical care received during the 
hospitalization and subsequent 30 days, labs, medications, other procedures and sur geries, 
outcomes such as readmissions, surgical complications and mortality and clinical and 
nursing notes.  
5. Importantly, the research coordinator will emphasize that the physiological data are not 
being monitored continuously with the patient. Patients sho uld still follow the instructions 
given by their care team on what symptoms should be reported immediately, and how to 
report them.  
6. Research coordinator documents informed consent process completion and files informed 
consent form  
7. VitalPatch is placed on p articipant and patch is paired with phone .  
8. Research coordinator teaches participant about VitalPatch, phone requirements, phone 
application and presents written information on wearing the devices and what is expected  
for the next 30 days  
9. For enrolled part icipants who are discharged over the weekend  or discharged before 
research staff place d devices on them , research coordinators will mail  the study kit and 
schedule a phone call to guide and educate patients on placing the patc h and operating the 
study phon e. The questionnaires or interviews may be completed over the phone if 
participants did not complete them before discharge.   
10. Participant agrees to complete required self -reported questionnaires and interviews  if 
applicable . 
11. Participant agrees to mail back  the phone and any unused supplemental patches in a pre -
paid mailer  
 
Once the patient agrees to the stu dy, the patient will sign the consent form the next day. We will give 
every patient at least 24 hours to decide whether or not they are willing to participate in the study. The 
26 
 research coordinator will follow up with potential participants after 24 hours. We will scan the signed 
consent form into EPIC and link the patient’s chart to the study.  
 
However, starting on 4/19/2021, the research team noticed that someileostomy patients were admitted 
over the weekend but discharged the following Monday . For sampling purposes, we will include these 
patients in the study.  For patients who require a phone consent, research coordinators will follow the 
below process : 
1. Research coordinators will approach the eligible patients the day of discharge, introduce 
the study, and go over the consent form with patients  
2. Research coordinators will provide the patient  with two copies  of the consent form and 
a pre -paid mailing envelope  
3. Research coordinators will  schedule a follow -up phone call with the patient for the next 
day 
4. Research coordinators will call patients the ne xt day  and answer any remaining 
questions the patients and caregivers might have about the study  
Suppose the patient is agreeable to participate in the study. In that case, the research 
coordinator will either (a) ask the patient for their email address an d send a copy of the 
consent form  to the patient’s email address via part 11 compliant  DocuSign. The research 
coordinator will review the consent form with the patient over the phone and have the 
patient sign via DocuSign. Research coordinators and the pat ient will both receive a signed 
copy of the consent form. Research  coordinators will schedule to overnight the study kit to 
the patient. (b) If the patient does not have an email address, the research coordinators will 
ask the patient to sign the consent f orm they received at discharge, and mail back the 
consent form using the prepaid mailing envelope provided by the research team . Upon 
receiving the signed consent form, coordinators will overnight the study kit to the patient.  
5. Once the patient receives the  study kit, the coordinators will call the patient to guide 
them to put on the patches and pair the phone.  
6. Coordinators will also complete required questionnaires and interviews over the phone 
with the patient  
 
 
4.3.1 Providers  
The research coordinator will be responsible for the consent of the clinical team staff for enrollment in 
this study. The consent process begins once the participant is interested in being interviewed for the 
study . At this time, the researcher will conduc t a thorough review of the consent details, including study 
procedure, risks, confidentiality, etc. , with the potential participant. It is assumed that working providers  
in the field will be mentally capable of participating  in the study ; therefore, no scr eening measures will 
be undergone to obtain eligibility. Researchers and investigators will be available to answer any 
questions the professionals have prior to consenting. The consent must be done in a face to face 
meeting or via video conferencing by the  researcher and the clinician. If consent is done through video 
conference, a signed consent form will still be collected by the research coordinator.  
27 
 4.4 Semi -Structured Interview Process  
4.4.1 Patients  
After obtaining informed consent, the research coordinator wi ll set up a time to complete the 
questionnaire and a 30 -minute semi -structured interview with the patient before discharge. Patients will 
be asked at the time of consent if they are willing to provide an email address for reminders and 
updates. After 30 da ys of remote monitoring, the research coordinator will contact patients via phone to 
complete the survey.  
At the study endpoint, the research team will make three phone attempts  to reach the patient on 
different days and times. If unable to reach the pati ent, the patient will then be contacted by their 
provider to remind them of completing the survey  and interview if applicable.  
Before the interview starts, the researcher will remind the participant not to use their name during the 
interview as it will be recorded.  These interviews will be transcribed and then de -identified by study 
staff.  They will also be reminded that recording is required for participation.  
4.4.2 Providers  
Upon signing the consent forms, the research coordinator will complete a self -adminis tered survey and 
interview with the clinical team staff. After completion of the study , the research coordinator will send 
out a questionnaire link to the clinical staff to complete within five business days. The research 
coordinator may set up an appointm ent with the clinical team  to complete the questionnaire via phone 
if the survey is not sent back, or if the survey contains skipped or missing questions.  At the study 
endpoint, the research coordinator will set up appointments with the clinical staff for a 30 -minute 
interview.  
Before the interview starts, the researcher will remind the provider not to use their name during the 
interview as it will be recorded.  These interviews will be transcribed and then de -identified by study 
staff.  They will also be reminded that recording is required for participation.  
4.5 Record keeping and transcripts  
The interview recordings will be sent to a transcription service company with whom the research team 
has a strong working relationship. The transcription service company have a secure server for uploads of 
recordings and delete them after transcription is complete. If any patient’s name is recorded on the 
transcripts, we will have the transcription service replace the name with an abbreviation instead. 
Transcripts will be scrubbed of PHI during transcription and will be given a study ID number.  Quality 
control to make sure all PHI has been removed from each transcript will be conducted by the Research 
Coordinator prior to analysis.  The final transcripts will be analyzed b y the study team. The list that links 
the transcripts to the research participants will also be stored on the secure collaboration portal. The 
recordings will be deleted once they have been transcribed and analyzed. The key for the study ID 
numbers will be  destroyed once the analysis is complete .  
28 
 4.6 Provisions to Protect the Privacy Interests of Participants  
All study information will be stored on NorthShore University HealthSystem password -protected, 
encrypted computers and servers that are password protected. All of these will be stored in locked 
rooms and will not be accessible to those outside the study team  
 
Patients will be given a unique study record number that is not their medical record number. This 
unique record number will be given to physIQ for entering into their portal. No identifying information 
will be provided to physIQ. The key that identifies the unique study record number to the patient MRN 
will only be kept by the study team and by the NorthShore teams that operationalize the study (CAPE 
navigators, monitoring nurse  and the clinical care team).  
 
In order to protect participant privacy, the research coordinator’s phone number and office address will 
be registered on the physIQ pinpointIQ portal for each participant. PhysIQ’s tec hnical support team will 
contact the research coordinator with the subject ID to inform the research team of noncompliance use 
of device. The research coordinator will call participant to review device usage instruction and provide 
technical assistance as needed.  
 
No PHI will be provided to physIQ and other study team members outside of NorthShore. The study 
team will collect patient name, MRN, date of birth, phone number for the purpose of conducting the 
study. All patient information will be aggregated du ring study analysis and no identifiers will be provided 
in the analysis.  
 
Upon study completion all study data will be destroyed,  and verification will be provided to data 
governance.  
 
During informed consent and enrollment, the study coordinator will ma ke sure that patients are alone 
or in a room with family members that the patient agrees to participate in decision making around the 
study. The door will be closed,  and any study -related information will be paused when other staff or 
visitors enter the ro om. We will allocate 1 hour for consent , and if required , we can extend the amount 
of time to make sure that the patient has all their questions answered and privacy maintained.  
4.7 Compensation and Economic Burden to Patients and Providers  
There is no economi c burden to patients who choose to participate  in this study for the devices and 
remote monitoring. Participants will be responsible for all routine care if incurred , including home 
health, counseling by nurses and care providers, office visits, diagnostic  tests and procedures , ER visits , 
and hospitalizations. If a participant is at risk of hospital readmission or has worsening conditions that 
require medical attention during the study period, in that case, participants will be responsible for all 
standard of care payments incurred during their escalation process.  
Patients enrolled in the Ileostomy cohorts who complete  all interview s with the study team will be 
provided a gift card as compensation for their time and participation.  
There is no economic burden  to care team members who choose to participate in the interview other 
than time spent answering questions to evaluate the process and wearable solution. We will provide a 
gift card to the providers as compensation for their time and participation.  
29

 5 DATA MANAGEMENT  
5.1 Data Security  
Survey d ata will be recor ded and managed using REDCap. REDCap will contain only a subject ID, assigned 
by the research coordinator. The PI, research coordinator and data scientist will maintain the only linking 
document between stu dy ID and patient name . It will be password protected and stored on Northshore 
University HealthSystem’s secure internal server.  During the study period , the operational team will also 
receive access to the linking information  to identify which patients a re in the pinpointIQ portal. Other 
study team members will not have access to the key.  
PhysIQ’s solution , including wearable devices, mobile device and cloud platform  on Microsoft Azure  was 
evaluated and approved  by data security (HIT) as part of a prioritized active project.  No PHI will be 
uploaded to the physIQ platform.  The vital and alert data will be transferred back to NorthShore for 
storage using a n sFTP . PhysIQ’s telemonitoring platform will be used for the study procedure. PhysIQ 
will not receive any protected health information.  
PhysIQ operates in line with both HIPAA and GDPR. Neither HIPAA nor GDPR support an external authority 
that can formally attest to compliance, but physIQ  does operate and measure its internal security and 
privacy program against  both frameworks and is operating in line with each.  
There are three (3) core components of the physIQ product; 1) a 3rd party disposable patch worn by the 
patient, 2) a physIQ supp lied mobile phone running as a data hub, and 3) a web browser -based clinical 
portal for viewing analytics and raw data. The data flow within these basic components is secure at all 
time. No sensitive and/or protected data resides in the physIQ offices nor on the corporate network.  
The sensor patch collects physiological data (not considered PHI) and through a 128 -bit encrypted 
Bluetooth offload, transmits that data to an Android -based, dedicated lockdown (kiosk) mobile phone, 
which is validated and approved  to interface and collect patient data. The device is provided by physIQ; 
this is not a bring -your -own -device (BYOD) system. In kiosk mode this device runs only the physIQ mobile 
application with no ability to make calls, SMS text, nor internet browsing. A ll Bluetooth offloaded 
physiological data is stored in Android’s encrypted memory. Furthermore, all data is deidentified; there is 
no PHI on the mobile device. The phone is assigned a “node ID” in the cloud platform which functions as 
the alias and link to  the specific phone. Uploads are made to the cloud with the node ID credentials. The 
mobile phone then uploads the data through cellular connection to physIQ’s Google Cloud Services (GCS) 
cloud platform.  
The physIQ cloud architecture includes service relat ionships with certified partners. The production (VPC) 
stack is in GCS, with the back -up snapshot in Amazon Web Services (AWS). The physIQ platform is an 
isolated GCS network inside which servers communicate with limited pinholes to the outside world. Port  
443 is the “front door” and uses TLS encryption for all traffic. All data exchange is sanctioned and handled 
by the API. physIQ’s product is entirely API -enabled. Mobile phone (node) uploads of data and Clinical 
Portal browser sessions are both API calls.  There are also two (2) VPN “back doors” for occasional 
maintenance of the VPC and for the read -only requests from AWS for back -ups.  
Other cloud security measures include; role -based -access -controls (RBAC) for all URL routes in the API and 
inside the product, all data -at-rest in GCS and AWS is encrypted by default schema, all patients in the 
31 
 system are known by GUIDs and identity data i s stored separately from medical data, and all servers (VMs) 
are instances of a security -hardened image  
Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) is a collaborating site and will have access to de -identified and date 
shifted patient and healthcare provider informa tion. No HIPAA identifiers will be included in the data 
shared with CMU. Collaborators at CMU will be involved in developing and evaluating the 30 -day 
readmission prediction model. Deidentified and date shifted data will be transferred to CMU over a 
Secure  Sockets Layer (SSL) using a HIPAA compliant File Transfer Protocol (FTP). Data will be stored at 
NorthShore and at CMU on password -protected, encrypted computers. All research team members and 
graduate and doctoral students working with the data will comp lete Human Subjects Research 
certification. After completion of this project, all data at both NorthShore and CMU will be destroyed.  
5.2 Protection of Participant Privacy  
Patient Privacy – During this study, non -invasive wearable devices will be provided to p atients to collect 
continuous physiologic data. PhysIQ’s solution, including wearable patches, mobile device and Microsoft 
Azure cloud platform comply with the administrative safeguards and implementation specifications 
described in 45CFR§164.308, with res pect to HIPAA. No PHI will be uploaded to the physIQ platform.  
The physiological data upload via digital cellular network is secured with TLS cryptographic protocol 
between the mobile phones and the server.  The physIQ platform is securely hosted in the G oogle cloud.  
The physIQ cloud stores the raw physiological telemetry data captured by the study device, and also 
stores analytical results generated by running that raw data through the physIQ Analytics Modules. All 
the telemetry and analytical results ar e stored separately from any personally identifiable information 
(PII) that an institution might choose to enter in the system.  There is no requirement to enter PII to use 
the platform, as all data can be tracked solely by random ID as well. PHI will not be transmitted to 
physIQ for this process and the only data that will be transmitted is a random study ID generated at 
NorthShore. NorthShore will maintain the key to the identifier. The data can only be obtained or viewed 
via secure authenticated login.  
The physiologic, alert, and patient reported status data will be transferred back to NorthShore for storage 
using a sFTP. Data from wearable devices and physIQ platfrom and EHR data from NorthShore will be 
linked, deidentified using standard NorthShore prot ocol prior to transfer to CMU via secure FTP. There is 
an existing Data Use Agreement in place between NorthShore and Carnegie Mellon University (CMU)  
which will be renewed for this project . Only the PI at NorthShore and Co -PI at CMU will have access to th e 
sFTP site. Only named study personnel will have access to data. PhysIQ will not have access to any PHI. 
Northshore and CMU will delete all data after study termination.

Biosensors  
Vital Connect VitalPatch  
VitalPatchTM (Vital Connect Inc) is an FDA 510(k) -cleared, wearable adhesive Band -Aid-like multi -sensor 
device which will be used to stream and collect continuous vital sign data from patients. The device is a 
disposable adhesive patch with an integral one -time -use battery and integrated electronics. The battery 
life of each disposable adhesive patch lasts a bout 7 days.   
The VitalPatchTM is generally applied to the skin of the patient’s left upper chest (worn diagonally on the 
chest above the heart or laterally on the rib cage just below the heart). Further VitalPatchTM description 
33 
 and instructions for that application are shown in an attached document.  VitalPatchesTM can be worn 
continuously, including in the shower.  VitalPatchesTM should be replaced when adhesion or the battery 
fails.  In addition, physIQ recommends considering the use of UNI -SOLVE wipes to assist in the removal 
of the VitalPatchTM.  
6.2 Data Transport via physIQ Android Mobile App and physIQ Platform  
The physIQ Android mobile app is loaded onto an Android -based phone or tablet mobile device.  The 
mobile device offloads vital sign data from th e VitalPatchTM (via low energy Bluetooth) and uploads it 
using digital cellular or WiFi network to the cloud -based server. In addition to transmitting physiological 
data, the app also may present questionnaires to the patient  that are ans wered directly within the app.  
Upload via digital cellular network is secured with TLS cryptographic protocol between the mobile 
phones and the server.  The physIQ platform is securely hosted in the Google cloud.  The physIQ cloud 
stores the raw physiolog ical telemetry data captured by the study device, and also stores analytical 
results generated by running that raw data through the physIQ Analytics Modules. All the telemetry and 
analytical results are stored separately from any personally identifiable in formation (PII) that an 
institution might choose to enter in the system.  There is no requirement to enter PII in order to use the 
platform, as all data can be trac ked solely by random ID as well . PHI will not be transmitted to physIQ for 
this process and the only data that will be transmitted is a random ID  generated at NorthShore . 
NorthShore will maintain the key to the identifier.  The data can only be obtained or viewed via secure 
authenticated login.  
6.3 Analytics  
The study will utilize physIQ’s multivariat e analytical methods that learn the behavior of an individual 
patient’s vital signs at a baseline, and then detect changes in the behavior of the vital signs compared to 
the baseline.  Changes in vital signs relationships may be indicative of current or fu ture important 
clinical events.   These changes are indicated through the Multivariate Change Index (“MCI”), which is a 
scalar index between 0 and 1, where values close to 0 indicate no significant change from baseline and 
values close to 1 indicated great er changes from baseline.   
Additional “feature” analytics include atrial fibrillation detection, arrhythmia (ectopic beat) burden, 
Cheyne -Stokes respiration, sleep quantification, and walking detection.   Clinician -defined rules include 
applying threshold s to time series vital signs, sleep fragmentation, tachycardia, bradycardia, A -Fib with 
RVR, elevated respiration rate, and long -duration horizontal posture.  
6.4 Regulatory Status    
This study is considered a non -significant risk (NSR) Investigational Device  Exemption (IDE) study 
according to 21 CFR §812.2(b) to evaluate the clinical utility of PhysIQ vital patch solution. All FDA -
cleared devices in pinpointIQ will be used according to their intended use.  The components of this 
system and clearance status ar e described below:

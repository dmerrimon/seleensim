Title: A Randomized, Double -Blind, Controlled, Phase 2/3 Study to Assess Efficacy, 
Long Term Safety and Tolerability of RT001 in Subjects with Friedreich’s Ataxia  
Protocol No:  RT001-006 
Study Drugs:   Active: RT001, 9 60 mg soft gelatin c apsules ( 9-cis, 12 -cis-11,11-D 2-linoleic acid 
ethyl ester [deuterated ethyl linoleate, or D 2-LA])  
Placebo : Soft gelatin c apsule of USP safflower oil  (Placebo  or H 2-LA)  
Study 
Population:  Friedreich’s ataxia (FRDA) p atients  who meet all entry criteria.  
Number of Subjects  The planned enroll ment is 60 subjects randomized 1:1 (active: placebo ).  
Randomization will be stratified by Friedreich Ataxia Rating Scale (FARS ) 
Neurological score: ≤ 45 and >45  
Enrollment of patients with age > 25 will be capped at 25 % of the total enrollment  
Dosing Schedule  Subjects will receive the content of nine capsules daily (8.64 g total dose) given as 3 capsules three times a day (TID) with meals for the first month of treatment. After this initial loading period, the dose will be reduced to s ix capsules daily ( 5.76 g total 
dose) given as 3 capsules with breakfast, and 3 capsules with dinner for the 
remainder of the trial, while on study drug. 
If a subject is unable to tolerate study drug because of adverse events during the 
initial loading period, the dose may be reduced to six capsules daily (5.76 g total dose) given as 3 capsules with breakfast, and 3 capsules with dinner.  
If a subject is  unable to tolerate study drug because of adverse events after the dose 
reduction to six capsules daily (5.76 g total dose) , the dose may be spread over three 
meals (2 capsules at breakfast, 2 capsules with lunch, and 2 capsules with dinner). If the subject is still unable to tolerate study drug after spreading it over three meals, the total dose may be reduced by 1- 2 capsules/day, preferably by reducing the dose 
for a meal from 2 to 1 capsule(s) as needed.  After 2 weeks of taking a dose of less 
than 6 caps/day, the subject should try to increase the dose to 6 capsules/day given as 2 capsules TID given with meals. If 6 caps/day is not tolerable, the subject can take the drug at the dose of less than 6 caps/day that was tolerable.

Version 8.0 - Date: 0 3 Nov 2021  The objective of the study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of 
RT001 at steady state.   
Optional PK Washout Sub-Study Objective:  
The objective of the study is to evaluate the washout blood levels of RT001 after 
treatment in RT001 -006 is completed.  
Study 
Methodology  
 This is a randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled study to evaluate the 
efficacy, safety, tolerability, in subjects with FRDA following the oral administration of study drug (active or pla cebo capsules). Subjects will self -
administ er the study drug orally with meals . While on study drug , subjects are 
recommended  to avoid eating foods high in PUFA s.  Subjects will keep food 
journals from screening through the completion of month 1 on study drug. After 
month 1, subjects will keep 2 -week food journals prior to the next scheduled onsite 
visit. Subjects (or parents/caregivers, as applicable)  will have an initial call and  as 
needed with the diet c oach to discuss food journal  completion requirements . 
 
CPET and the T 1MW/T25FW should be separated in time to allow the subject to 
recover sufficiently before doing the next test. CPET should occur in the morning 
after fasting for a minimum of 2 hours  (if the subject has had a meal /snack ), with 
neither caffeine n or nicotine for at l east 12 hours before testing.  All tests should be 
done at approximately the same time and order  each day.   
Study Duration Participation is anticipated to require 13 months .  
• Screening : Up to 30 days from start of treatment  
• Treatment Period: treatment for a 12- month period  
For patients who consent to the Optional Wash out Sub-Study Objective, the study 
duration will be 19 months.  
Study Design  The planned enrollment is 60 subjects randomized 1:1 active:  placebo . There are 
two optional PK sub -studies. Subjects will have the opportunity to consent to these 
studies at the Day 330 visit or at the time of the first draw.  
 
Safety Assessments  Safety assessments include physical and neurologic examinations, vital signs, 12-
lead electrocardiogram (ECG) tracing , and clinical laboratory tests (hematology, 
clinical chemistry, lipid profile, coagulation, and urinalysis) to identify adverse 
events (AEs). Adverse events will be evaluated for incidence, severity, and relationship to study drug.  Any AE ongoing at the End of Treatment  (EOT)  phone 
call will be followed to conclusion or until stabilized.

arachidonic acid (H2 -ARA) in plasma, and D2-LA, D2-ARA H2-LA, and H2 -ARA 
in red blood cells.  
 
Blood samples will be collected for the plasma measurements as follows:  
Month 4 (Day 120 ± 30 days) : Pre-dose (prior to breakfast)  
Month 8 (Day 240 ± 30 days) : Pre-dose (prior to breakfast)  
Month 11 (Day 330 ± 30 days) : Pre-dose (prior to breakfast)  
 
Blood samples for the assessments in red blood cells will be collected as fol lows:  
Month 4 (Day 120 ± 30 days) : Pre-dose (prior to breakfast)  
Month 8 (Day 240 ± 30 days) : Pre-dose (prior to breakfast)  
Month 11 (Day 330 ± 30 days) : Pre-dose (prior to breakfast)  
 
Additional blood samples will be collected and stored for future biomarker analysis 
as follows:  
Day 1: Pre-dose (prior to breakfast)  
Month 4 (Day 120 ± 30 days) : Pre-dose (prior to breakfast)  
Month 8 (Day 240 ± 30 days) : Pre-dose (prior to breakfast)  
Month 11 (Day 330 ± 30 days) : Pre-dose (prior to breakfast)  
 
Two additional optional PK sub-studies are offered. The first study is a 24hr PK 
Profile at steady state that will occur immediately before or after the Day 330 visit. Blood samples for this study will be collected as follows:  
Day 1:  Hour - 1.0 to -0.5 (pre -breakfast, pre-dose), 0.5 (± 5 min), 1 (± 5 min), 2 
(± 10 min), 4 (± 15 min) (pre -lunch), 8 (± 15 min) (pre -dinner), and 12 (± 60 min)  
Day 2:  24 hours following dosing on Day 1 (± 60 min; pre -breakfast, pre-dose)  
The second optional sub-study is a 6 -month study to evaluate the washout blood 
levels of RT001 after treatment in RT001 -006 is completed. Depending on the 
timing of entry into the sub -study, blood samples for this study will be collected as 
follows:  
7 days (± 1 day)  
4 weeks (± 7 days)  
12 weeks (± 7 days)  
24 weeks (± 7 days)  
Efficacy Assessments  Subjects will perform CPET using a recumbent exercise bike at Screening, on Day 1, Day 120 (± 30 days), Day 24 0 (± 30 days) , and Day 33 0 (± 30 days) . Peak oxygen 
consumption and peak work rate will be measured during incremental exercise testing. CPET should occur after fasting (if the subject has had a meal/ snack) for a 
minimum of 2 hour s, with n either  caffeine nor nicotine for at least 12 hours before 
testing.

Retrotope, Inc.  
Version 8.0 - Date: 0 3 Nov 2021  Subjects (with or without assistive device) will perform a T1MW and T25FW at 
Screening, on  Day 1, Day 120 (± 30 days), Day 24 0 (± 30 days), and Day 33 0 (± 30 
days).  
CPET and the T1MW/T25FW should be separated in time to allow the subject to 
recover sufficiently before doing the next test. All tests should be done at 
approximately the same time and order for each visit. 
The FARS -Neuro and clinician -rated CGI scale will be performed at Screening, on 
Day 1, Day 120 (± 30 days), Day 24 0 (± 30 days), and Day 33 0 (± 30 days ) by a 
qualified physician or health professional who is trained on the use of the tool.  The 
CPET examination should always precede the FARS -Neuro evaluation at all visits.  
A trained  health professional will also work with th e subject to perform  the speech 
measurement recording at Screening, on Day 1, Day 24 0 (± 30 days), and Day 33 0 
(± 30 days ). 
The FARS -ADL, SF-36, VAS (for Fatigue ), Fatigue scale, Neuro -QoL scales (lower 
extremity function and upper extremity function)  and Fall Questionnaire will be 
completed by the subjects at screening and at the visits on Day 1, Day 120 
(± 30 days), Day 240 (± 30 days), and Day 330 (± 30 days). The Patient Global 
Impression of Change (PGI -C) scale and VAS (for Improvement of FA symptoms ) 
will be completed by all subjects at Day 120 (± 30 days), Day 2 40 (± 30 days), and 
Day 3 30 (± 30 days). In between the clinic visits, subjects will also be contacted by 
phone by a study site staff member and asked questions relating to the PGI-C scale, 
Fatigue scale, Neuro -QoL scales (lower extremity function, and upper extremity 
function), and questions 8  and 9 of the F all Q uestionnaire. These phone ‘visits’ will 
take place monthly.  A Speech Assessment Questionnaire will also be completed  by 
the subject and parents/caregiver (as applicable) at Screening, on Day 1, Day 24 0 
(± 30 days), and Day 33 0 (± 30 days ). 
Between clinic visits subjects will be asked to keep a daily log (diary) documenting falls, near-falls, stumbles, and fear of falling .

requirement  While on study drug, subjects are recommended to avoid eating foods high in  
PUFA s. Subjects will keep food journals from screening through the completion of 
month 1 on study drug. After month 1, subjects will keep 2-week food journals prior 
to next scheduled onsite visit. Subjects (or parents/caregivers, as applicable) will

Fish oil, Cod Liver oil, Edible algae oil and Flax oil are also prohibited.  
Statistical methods  Demographic data will be presented using descriptive statistics (e.g., mean, stan dard 
deviation, median, and range). Exposure to study drug and reasons for 
discontinuation will be tabulated. Safety variables will be tabulated and presented 
for all subjects who receive study drug or placebo  capsules. Adverse events will be 
coded using t he Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). The 
incidence of treatment -emergent AEs will be presented by system organ class and 
preferred term. Adverse events will be presented by severity and relationship to

will be summarized across time. Shift tables will be provided for selected laboratory 
parameters. Physical examination results will be presented in listings.  
Change from baseline (CFB) will be analyzed by comparing the change between 
treatment groups using a mixed model with repeated measures (MMRM). The 
MMRM will compare the estimated change from baseline between treatments for the primary endpoint. This analysis will assess whether there is a difference in 
estimated CFB between active and placebo groups at 11 months.  
The primary analysis of percent change from baseline to 11  months in MVO2 as 
measured by CPET will use the ITT methodology and an MMRM methodology with a random slope and intercept for each individual.   
  
All secondary and exploratory endpoints CFB values will be analyzed using 
the MMRM Responder analyses will be run on MVO2 (primary), GST, 
T1MW, Peak Workload, mFARS, and CGI- C (functional assessment). The 
PK of D2 -LA, D2 -ARA, H2 -LA, and H2 -ARA will be characterized in terms of 
minimum and maximum exposure at steady state.   
For the primary analysis of peak workload, group sample sizes of 30 and 30 achieve 
over 99% power to reject the null hypothesis of equal means when the population 
mean difference is μ1 - μ2 = 7.5 - -8.3 = 15.8 with a standard deviation for both 
groups of 11.1 and with a significance level (alpha) of 0.05 using a two -sided two -
sample equal- variance t -test. 
 
Safety 
Monitoring  The blinded safety and efficacy data will be reviewed by the medical  monitor  on an 
ongoing basis. A Data Safety and Monitoring Board (DSMB) will be established to 
evaluate events according to the DSMB Charter . The  safety and efficacy review data 
will not be made available to the Principal Investigators unless changes need to be 
made to the protocol for safety reasons.

Version 8.0 - Date: 03 Nov 2021  6. INTRODUCTION  
6.1. Friedreich’s Ataxia  
Friedreich ’s ataxia (FRDA ), a sy ndrome of ataxia in all 4 limbs  with an onset of symptoms 
between late childhood and early adolescence, is a model of significant mitochondrial 
dysfunction with excess chronic oxidative damage leading to selective cell death  and significant 
neurologic damage ( Santos et al ., 2010; Armstrong et al., 2010). It is characterized by 
neurodegeneration of the dorsal root ganglia with loss of large sensory neurons and the posterior columns, and by degeneration in the spinocerebellar and corticospinal tracts in the spinal cord 
with cerebellar involvement ( Santos et al ., 2010 ). While relatively rare, it is the most common of 
the inherited ataxias with prevalence of 1:50,000 in the United States ( US) ( Armstrong et al., 
2010; Santos et al., 2010 ). Other d isease findings may include scoliosis, diabetes, incontinence, 
cardiomyopathy, optic atrophy, and hypoacusis with median life expectancy of 35 years. 
Physiologically, FRDA is characterized by mitochondrial dysfunction and inefficient oxidative metabolism with three particular findings: intracellular iron deposits; a deficit in the 
mitochondrial iron -sulfur (FeS) cluster containing enzymes such as aconitase and respiratory 
chain Complexes I -III; and the presence of markers of oxidative damage in the blood and urine 
(Martelli et al ., 2012).  
The genetic basis of FRDA is a recessive GAA trinucleotide expansion mutation of the first intron in the frataxin gene (FXN). The normal frataxin gene has ≤  40 GAA repeats, while FRDA 
subjects have increasing and varying GAA repeats. This expansion leads to significantly 
decreased protein expression levels (5% to 30% of normal) of the frataxin protein ( Santos et al ., 
2010; Martelli et al., 2012). The low levels of frataxin cause dysregulation of normal iron levels 
resulting in an insufficient supply of iron to the FeS complexes, the primary cause of inefficient 
mitochondrial energy generation. The suboptimal delivery of iron to the FeS complexes results in 
a number of secondary potentially toxic reflexive mechanisms such as an excess of free Fe
+2, 
which in turn catalyzes HO• (hydroxy radical) production from H 2O2 that leads to widespread 
lipid peroxidation ( Foury & Cazzalini, 1997; Qian & Buettner, 1999). The chronic reactive 
oxygen species ( ROS ) generation overwhelms the intramitochondrial and intracellular ROS 
quenching systems leading to significant oxidative damage, inefficient power generation, 
widespread cellular dysfunction, and premature cell death (Armstrong et al., 2010; Guéraud et 
al., 2010).  
6.2. Oxidative Stress and Neurodegenerative Disease 
A great deal of evidence exists that demonstrates the involvement of oxidative stress in the pathology of neurological disorders. Moreover, the vulnerability of the central nervous system to 
ROS -mediated injury is well established since neurons consume large amounts of oxygen, the 
brain has many areas containing high iron content, and neuronal mitochondria generate large

fatty acids, which are particularly susceptible to oxidative stress. The biological roles of products 
produced by lipid peroxidation have received much attention, not only for their pathological mechanisms associated with neurological disorders, but also for their practical clinical 
applications as biomarkers. Reactive oxygen species are likely to play a pathophysiological role 
in many neurological disorders, including Alzheimer’s disease, Down syndrome, Parkinson’s disease, and stroke.  
The brain is e xtremely sensitive to oxidative damage for several reasons. The brain consumes an 
inordinate amount of oxygen (around 20%), particularly when considering the fact that the brain accounts for only 2% of body weight ( Halliwell, 2006). A major reason for the high O
2 uptake is 
the vast amounts of ATP needed to maintain neuronal intracellular ion homeostasis in the face of ion channels need for action potentials and neurosecretion. Additionally, several brain areas, including the substantia nigra, caudate nucleus, putamen, and globus pallidus, are rich in iron 
content ( Zecca et al. , 2004). It is generally accepted that iron accumulates in the brain of older 
individuals, and iron ions that are released following brain damage can catalyze free radical 
reactions . The brain is a source of ROS. Complex I-dependent hydrogen peroxide generation in 
brain mitochondria is greater than that in skeletal muscle mitochondria (Malinska et al. , 2009) . 
Lastly, neuronal membranes are rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), particularly arachidonic acid (AA), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) ( Chen et 
al., 2008). These PUFAs are particularly vulnerable to oxidative stress due to their degree of 
unsaturation (multiple double bonds). For these reasons , neural cells are more susceptible to 
oxidative damage when compared to other body tissues. 
The mechanism of ROS production differs in each neurological disorder; excess amounts of 
oxidized lipids causing neurological degeneration may be the result of exc essive generation of 
these compounds, reduced clearance, or some com bination of the two processes. These 
differences provide multiple targets for therapeutic intervention.  However, any intervention that 
results in less lipid peroxidation is likely to exhibit some therapeutic benefit in neurological degeneration. In FA, the cause of excessive ROS is the excess production that accompanies low 
levels of expression of the iron chaperon protein frataxin,  causing oxidation stress from Fenton 
reaction catalysis of free -iron induced lipid peroxidation. 
6.3. Non-Clinical Rationale Supporting RT001 Development for FRDA  
RT001 is a site-specific (C11) di-deutero synthetic homologue of linoleic acid (LA) ethyl ester. 
It has been established that substitution of hydrogen with deuterium at specific bis -allylic sites, 
as in RT001, decreases the production of lipid peroxidation products in yeast models of oxidative stress ( Hill et al., 2011; Hill et al., 2012; Grazia Cotticelli et al., 2013; Abeti et al., 2015; 
Andreyev et al., 2015). In vitro  yeast, murine, and human models of FRDA also indicated that 
RT001 free acid managed the oxidative stress associated with increased iron ( Grazia Cotticelli et

Version 8.0 - Date: 03 Nov 2021  al., 2013; Abeti et al., 2015). The significance of the results with FRDA model sy stems is 3 -fold. 
First, oxidative stress in FRDA has been difficult to measure, and the protective effects of 
deuterated p olyunsaturated fatty acids (D-PUFAs ) in the FRDA cell models indicate not only 
that there is oxidative stress in these models, but also emphasize the importance of lipid 
peroxidation damage. Second, results further support the proposal that reinforcing essential 
PUFAs with isotopic replacement decreases lipid peroxidation and decelerates toxic cellular cascades. Third, the results sugges t that dietary dosed D- PUFAs  such as RT001, which are easily 
distributed to all the target tissues, might be an effective therapeutic strategy for the treatment of FRDA. The chemical basis for this decrease in lipid peroxidation is the kinetic isotope effe ct 
(KIE). KIE is related to the difference in molecular weight, substitution of deuterium for 
hydrogen (with a 100% in increase in molecular weight) exhibits one of the largest KIEs 
observed. The KIE of RT001 vs. LA  has been well documented ( Hill et al., 2012, Lamberson et 
al., 2014).  
Given the deleterious effects of frataxin mutations on the mitochondrial electron transport chain, and the presence of mitochondrial iron accumulation in FRDA, the PUFA- rich inner 
mitochondrial membranes are the primary site s of autoxidative damage. In H9C2 myoblasts, 
treatment with t-ButOOH caused both respiratory inhibition and increased membrane leak. RT001 free acid protected mitochondrial function from stress caused by t- ButOOH; maximal 
respiration was preserved and membrane leak age was diminished ( Andreyev et al., 2015).  
6.4. Clinical Rationale Supporting RT001 Development for FRDA  
RT001-002 was a randomized, double blind, comparator controlled, 28- day clinical study with 2 
cohorts of 9 subjects each randomized 2:1 to RT001 or linoleic acid control in identical gel capsules. Cohort 1 received 1.8 g/day (2 capsules) and Cohort 2 received 9.0 g/day (10 capsules) with meals. All subjects were followed for 28 days with a 30 -day safety follow up. The primary 
endpoint was safety, to lerability , and pharmacokinetics. The secondary endpoints were timed 25-
foot walk (T25FW) test and 
Friedreich Ataxia Rating Scale  (FARS ) neurologic scale measurement 
comparing baseline to test results on Day 2 8. Exploratory endpoints included changes in 
pharmacodynamic biomarkers, multi -axis movement measurement of the lower extremity during 
the T25FW test, and measurement of exercise capacity using a Cardio -Pulmonary Exercise 
Testing ( CPET) protocol to measure peak workload and maximum rate of oxygen consumption 
(VO 2 MAX) when performed on a recumbent bicycle with full pulmonary metabolic 
measurements.  
A total of 19 subjects were enrolled in RT001 -002 (13 subjects in the RT001 group and 
6 subjects in the comparator group). Of the 19 enrolled subjects, 17 subjects completed the study. The two subjects who withdrew from the study were in the RT001 group.

in both cohorts and appeared to be approaching a steady state by the Day 28 dosing interval. 
Mean plasma D 2-LA concentrations on Day 28 fluctuated slightly (less than 2-fold) during the 12 
or 24 h dosing interval, and then fell slowly, with a mean terminal half- life of 42 .3 ± 9.8 h in 
Cohort 1 and 30.3 ± 18.3 h in Cohort 2 (Table 6, Table 7). When the daily dose was increased 5-fold from 1.8 g to 9.0 g, the AUC
0-24h on Day 28 rose from 1527 ± 445 ug•h/mL to 6800 ±

The CPET testing change between baseline and Day 28 showed an improvement in peak 
workload of +0.16 watts/kg (25.7%) in the subjects on all doses of study drug (n=10) vs. 
comparator (n=6). The reported p value in post hoc analysis was p=0.008 (Mann-Whitney Rank 
Sum test). This modified Intent- To-Treat (mITT) analysis excluded 2 subjects unable to either 
start or complete the test, and full Intent- To-Treat ( ITT) analysis including the two subjects, had 
a p= 0.021. Similarly, the study showed a strong trend from baseline to Day 28 of therapy in peak oxygen consumption ( VO
2 MAX). The median change from baseline for comparator vs. 
RT001 was - 0.02 L/min vs. 0.14 L/min; respectively, p=0.116. Assessment on the neurological 
examination of the Friedreich Ataxia Rating Scale  (FARS -Neuro ) scoring showed a trend in 
improvement between baseline and Day 28 of treated vs. placebo patients (a decrease of 1.95 FARS points, p= 0.348 ITT). This result was on top of a decrease of 2.8 FARS points in the 
placebo group, (i.e. a 4.75 FARS point decrease from baseline for the treated group), 
highlighting the robust placebo effect in the FARS -Neuro measure that has been documented 
elsewhere ( Zesiewicz, 2017 ). Expected change in FARS -Neuro for one month of dosing based 
on extensive natural history data ( Patel et. al., 2016) would be ~ +0.25 FARS points. The 
average stride speed (stride time)
-1 during the T25FW, measured with an electronic motion 
sensor , improved 7% (p=0.15 ITT) . Traditionally measured T25FW-1 (via stopwatch) showed no 
signal of significance (p=0.88).  
The relatively small size and short duration of the trial necessitates caution in over -interpretation 
of efficacy results. Nevertheless, clear correlations between the various parameters measured

Version 8.0 - Date: 03 Nov 2021  cross- sectionally across all patient encounters can be seen in RT001 -002.  Comparisons of peak 
workload, VO 2 MAX, FARS -Neuro Score, and T25FW show consistent correlation. This 
indicates that these are all legitimate measures of disease severity, and correlative to traditional 
measures such as FARS neuro, which may be less consistent and predictable than CPET -
determined peak workload and VO 2 MAX. 
6.5. Non-Clinical Safety Summary 
Refer to the Investigator Brochure  for a summary of the nonclinical studies conducted with 
RT001. There was no adverse finding in any parameter in Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) dietary toxicity rat studies of RT001 up to 26- week s at the highest doses tested, averaging 
452 mg/kg (401 and 502 mg/kg in males and females; respectively).   
Long-term increased intake of dietary fats, including LA , can lead to obesity when consumed 
above normal ranges. As a result, obese rats are no longer normal,  and this state of physiological 
dysregulation has a confounding effect on the interpretation of direct toxicological effects (Heden et al ., 2014). To avoid the confounding effects of obesity, the LA  content in rat studies 
were based on physiologic levels of PUFAs. Further dose escalation of RT001 in rat studies 
poses a challenge as higher doses result in polyunsaturated fat intake in excess of accepted 
healthy diet values. This would lead to a study in elevated fat intake, elevated PUFA intake, and altered caloric density, rather than a clear study of RT00 1 effects. In our studies at the highest 
dose tested, the total fat made up 14% of the subject dietary calories, the recommended maximum level for rats ( National Academy of Sciences, 1995 ), and RT001 made up 100% of the 
LA component.  
In animal studies, RT001 was found to be equivalent to, and biologically interchangeable with normal dietary LA  as a sole source (100% replacement) of LA , indicating that the substitution of 
hydrogen with deuterium does not interfere with the normal biology of the fat. If this was not the 
case, essential lipid deficiency diseases ( Burr & Burr, 1929 and 1930) would be observed in the 
treated populations. In addition, LA  is recognized by the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA) 
as generally recognized as safe ( GRAS ), and has no upper limit under the GRAS designation. 
Additionally, IntraLipid
® is approved as an IV drug at doses up to 93 g/day LA  (2.5 g/kg/day) 
based on a 60 -kg person ( IntraLipid Prescribing Information, 2006) representing a 16.3-fold 
safety margin over the dose of 5.7 g/day. 
6.6. Clinical Safety Summary 
In clinical study RT001-002, one subject in cohort 2 (9g/day dose group) dropped from the study on Day 3 after experiencing severe oily diarrhea  (steatorrhea ). The subject was hospitalized for 
overnight observation. The symptoms resolved spontaneously within several hours and there 
were no signs of gastrointestinal ( GI) malabsorption. The subject had a remarkably low body 
mass at 38.9 kg, suggesting that care must be observed at the highest dose in low body mass

was judged to be severe and probably related to study drug. Another subject withdrew due to an 
AE of depression. Diarrhea was reported in 3 additional subjects in the RT001 treatment group and 1 subject in the comparator treatment group of cohort 2. These events were assessed by the 
investigators as mild and possibly related to study drug. The other treatment -emergent adverse 
events (TEAEs) were assessed by the Investigators as mild (grade 1) or moderate (grade 2) in 
severity and unrelated to study drug. The TEAEs are shown by System Organ Class (SOC) and

In addition to RT001-002, RT001 is currently in use in 19 subjects with infantile neuroaxonal 
dystrophy in the U.S.  The study enrollment is complete,  and subjects continue to participate in 
the extension trial .  No serious adverse or unexpected drug- related events have been reported in 
the study thus far. 
RT001 is also  being administered in several Expanded Access studies. These E xpanded A ccess 
studies have been implemented when a plausible mechanism for RT001 therapeutic benefit is 
considered. The Expanded Access studies have served to support PK, efficacy, and safety data while generating experience in neurodegenerative conditions that might later war rant a formal 
study in a treatment protocol. Refer to the Investigator Brochure, for additional information of RT001 Sponsor clinical studies and Expanded Access studies. 
At the present stage of development, the risk of RT001 seems acceptable considering the 
potential benefit of RT001 treatment for patients diagnosed with Friedreich’s ataxia. Based on 
these observed gastrointestinal disorder adverse events, we believe that a maximal tolerated dose of 9.0 g/d may have been reached and steps are being taken in the current protocol to address this 
issue by reducing the dose to 5.76 g/d and dividing the dose between 2 or 3 meals. Additional 
adjustment possibilities have been added to the protocol to correct for diarrhea- related adverse 
events for low body mass a dults and children.

Version 8.0 - Date: 03 Nov 2021  6.7. Inclusion of Pediatric Subjects of 12 Years  and Older  in the Current 
Protocol  
The decision to include pediatric subjects with FRDA in a clinical trial requires per the 
regulations a careful analysis of the risks and poten tial benefits to the subjects. Inclusion of 
pediatric subjects also involves an analysis of whether or not the subjects would be 
representative of the population of subjects under study, and whether or not the pediatric subjects 
would be able to comply with the protocol requirements.  
RT001 is a deuterated formulation of linoleic acid, the predominant fatty acid in several 
approved drug products for IV nutritional supplementation, including the widely used 
IntraLipidTM. Pediatric subjects in the clinical trials that led to  the approval of the nutritional 
supplementation drugs containing linoleic acid constituted more than half of all enrolled patients. 
Most adverse reactions were related to the route of administration than to the drug itself; the 
warning for use in pediatri c patients limiting use to less than 3g/kg/day was related to a side 
effect that was clearl y linked to IV administration. RT001 is planned for oral administration 
only, and the maximum daily dosage will be 8.64 g/day for 30 days followed by 5.76g/day . The 
average weight of a 12 to 14-year old patient is approximately 40 kg. Therefore, the maximum 
dosage administered orally in our clinical trial will be 0.216 g/kg/day, far less than the maximum 
recommended IV dosage for pediatric patients using IntraLipid.  The use of RT001 in pediatric 
patients is likely to be safe, as evidenced by the many years of safe use of the nutritional supplements in this age group. In the clinical trials of RT001 in adults, steatorrhea has been the only significant adverse reacti on, and this appears to be easily manageable with dose adjustment.  
The chief benefit of including pediatric patients in clinical trials with FA include the potential for halting or reversing disease progression. The early age of onset of FA, its most rapid progression 
in the first years after diagnosis, and its tendency to produce most severe disability in patients 
who present earliest in life, all necessitate the development of an effective treatment that is applicable to pediatric patients.  If RT001 is s hown to be beneficial in treating FA, pediatric 
patients are likely to be the greatest beneficiaries of this therapy.  
RT001 is currently in use in a pediatric study with 19 patients with infantile neuroaxonal dystrophy aged between 18 months and 10 years of age. Each patient is receiving RT001 at a 
dose of 1 capsule TID (2.88 g/day). At present, no adverse drug effects have been identified or 
reported. 
In previous clinical trials of FA patients, pediatric age subjects have been found to be 
cooperative and i mportant contributors to observational studies ( Sival e t al. 2011, Patel et al. 
2016).  The requirement for cardiopulmonary exercise testing ( CPET) for determination of the 
primary endpoint in the clinical trial with RT001 will require subject cooperation w hich exceeds 
the capacity of pediatric patients of younger age. Previous observational studies of pediatric 
patients with FA that required the performance of CPET have limited the use of CPET in the

(Artuch et al. 2002), or 16 years ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED], [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]). Retrotope believes that the 
enrollment of FA patients 1 2 years old and above strikes the optimal balance between risk, 
benefits, and practicality for the present clinical trial.  
6.8. Potential Risks and Benefits to Human Subjects 
FA is a rare, inherited recessive disorder characterized by progressive degenerative changes, in 
particular to mitochondria, which lead to morbidity and mortality at a young age. There is 
currently no approved therapy for this condition. RT001 offers a novel yet specific approach to mitigation of the harmful oxidative attack on lipids of mitochondrial membranes, which has 
potential benefit if the hypothesis is proven in this and subsequent efficacy studies. RT001 is 
based on a common, essential dietary sour ced fatty acid, LA. The slight modification to the 
chemical structure of LA, the site-specific replacement of 2 hydrogen atoms with 2 deuterium 
atoms, does not impact any of the key properties and fate of the lipid, yet remains functionally 
active against unwanted, pathological oxidative attack. The deuterium presents low risk (see below) in that it is stably incorporated in covalent bonds, and the amount dosed is relatively low. 
Thus, the risk -benefit profile is thought to be favorable and suggests a futur e potential benefit of 
RT001 treatment in this intractable condition.  
In models of neurodegenerative diseases, possible triggers such as an aberrant protein (e.g., beta amyloid or synuclein), the low expression of frataxin in FA, chemical or environmental toxins, 
or redox imbalances, induce a stress in the cell that is first manifested in lipid peroxidation inside mitochondria where several factors combine to make the cells most susceptible. Those factors 
include: 1) the high concentration of ROS generated by cellular energy generation; 2) the 
concentrated accumulation of highly susceptible PUFAs in the mitochondrial inner membrane; and 3) inadequate protection by antioxidants due to the hydrophobic nature of the inner 
membrane that limits antioxidant solubility and diffusion into the susceptible domains. Most 
important to our mechanism of action is the recognition that the accelerated free radical chain reaction that results from disease amplifies damage massively through an autocatalytic process 
that propagates recurring damage from a single initiating event. The initiating event is a slow, 
rate determining step that is self -propagating in its damage to membranes. Stabilizing the bonds 
most susceptible to oxidation in the initiating event can shut down an entire cascade of 
accelerating damage in a non -stoichiometric fashion and can provide a new treatment modality 
for disorders of lipid peroxidation. 
RT001 is a site- specific deuterated analogue of LA ethyl ester. LA is designated by the FDA as 
GRAS with no up per limit set by toxicity. The exposure to LA in the typical Western diet ranges 
from 5  to 20 g/day. Intralipid
® 20%, a product approved by FDA for intravenous (IV) parenteral 
nutrition, can be administered at doses which provide up to 93 g/day of LA (2.5 g/kg of Intralipid 
which is up to 2/3 LA). As demonstrated in nonclinical and in vitro  studies, there were no

Version 8.0 - Date: 03 Nov 2021  demonstrable adverse metabolic effects of deuterating LA. Likewise, the amount of deuterium to 
be administered at the highest dose proposed for us e in this clinical study is approximately four -
orders of magnitude lower than the safety threshold described by the International Atomic 
Energy Agency ( IAEA, 2009).  
Linoleic acid is the predominant fatty acid in two emulsions approved by the FDA as a source of calories and essential fatty acids. Intralipid 10% (Cutter Pharmaceuticals, IND 17 -643) was 
submitted as an NDA on August 9, 1974. Also,  around this time, Liposyn 10% (Abbott 
Laboratories, IND 18 -203) also was filed. These intravenous formulations were developed to 
provide nutrition to patients who had conditions which precluded effective enteral feeding. Subsequent to these approvals, some changes have been made to the concentration and plant source for the various products, but the component fatty acids have remained consistent. 
Intralipid is predominantly soybean oil in concentrations of 10%, 20% and 30%. Egg yolk 
phospholipids are added in a concentration of about 1.2%. Liposyn includes both soybean and 
safflower oil in the identical concentrations. The approximate major component fatty acids 
include linoleic (65%), oleic (20%), palmitic (5%), linolenic (5%), and stearic (5%). Intralipid was approved based on the results of 67 studies conducted before approval. These included 4 
studies in 22 human volunteers, and 63 studies in 298 patients. Of the patients included in the 
studies, 128 were adults, and 170 were pediatric patients (mostly infants). The studies showed that the product was pharmacologically inactive and relatively well-tolerated. Most adverse drug 
reactions were related to the route of administration rather than to the systemic effects of the 
product itself. These reactions included: local vein reaction, sepsis, allergic reactions, hyperlipidemia, fever, sleepiness, headache, nausea, vomiting, flushing, hypercoagulability, 
thrombophlebitis, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, tachycardia, dyspnea, splenomegaly, and 
shock. 
Post approval, deaths were reported in association with Intralipid use in pre -term infants. This 
was thought due to fat accumulation in the lungs in these infants. The maximum dose used in 
pediatric patients was reduced to 3 g/kg/day, and a warning placed on the label for use in pediatric patients.  
Deuterated LA and other deuterated PUFAs have been used safely and extensively in biochemistry and nutrition research for several decades to elucidate the metabolic pathways for fatty acid metabolism, cell membrane integrity and prostaglandin synthesis ( Brenna, 1997). 
Single and multiple doses of deuterated PUFAs (up to 10-18 g) have been used in clinical studies without adverse reactions. A wide variety of deuteration positions on LA have been used for those studies, and some, including perdeuterated LA, included deuterium at the C11 position. For 
example, Emken and colleagues investigated the desaturation of 18:0 and 16:0 and 18:2n-6 and 
18:3n-3 elongation/desaturation in four healthy adults, who received oral doses of about 3-3.5 g of d
2-18:2n-6, d 4,-18:3n-3, and d 6-18:n-9 fatty acids ( Emken et al., 1990 ). Salem and colleagues

Version 8.0 - Date: 03 Nov 2021  have safely administered d 5-18:2n-6 and d 5-18:3n-3 doses of 50-10 mg/kg body weight to 
premature infants and  showed that infants as small as 1,980 g and 32 weeks gestation elongate 
and desaturate both precursors within 24 hours ( Salem et al., 1996).  
Based on the initial analysis of data from RT001-002, RT001 remains very safe. The maximal 
tolerated adult dose studied is approximately 9.0 g/d above which steatorrhea/diarrhea may 
occur. In the initial 28- day study, signs of clinical activity may have been demonstrated. These 
changes in clinical activity markers were not expected in this 28 -day study, but they form the 
basis for Study RT001-006 where RT001 will be dosed for 11  months. 
6.9. Description and Justification for the Dosing Regimens to Be Studied 
LA cannot be synthesized by mammals and is an essential component of the human diet. LA is the most common dietary source of polyunsaturated fat for humans and is a source of metabol ic 
energy (9 Calories/g) and longer chain omega-6 fatty acids. LA is also the starting compound for 
other desaturated and elongated fatty acids that are normal physiological lipid components 
(e.g., arachidonic acid 20:4n-6), an important fatty acid in membrane phospholipids. Nonclinical studies have shown that RT001 recapitulates LA biochemistry in normal physiological lipid processing. 
The amount of deuterium contained in the high dose proposed for the clinical study is below 
doses commonly used for isotope labeling studies. The dose of RT001 will contribute 
approximately 80 Calories and is within the range of daily fat intake recommended by the 
Centers for Disease Control (CDC).  
RT001 has been administered in humans at a higher level than the current study proposed dosing 
regimen and was found to be safe in Study RT001-002. There was one treatment emergent 
adverse event report characterized as serious – steatorrhea associated with the use of study drug.  
The event resolved after 6 hours. The subject was hospitalized for overnight observation.  The 
subject had no other symptoms and did not receive specific treatment. Upon questioning, a few 
other subjects in the high dose cohort also reported occasional diarrhea that was mild and not worrisome. The dose for this study is 8.64 g/d for 30 days followed by 5.76 g/day , which is well 
below the highest tested dose of 9.0 g/day in Study RT001-002.

Version 8.0 - Date: 03 Nov 2021  8. INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
8.1. Study Design  
This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo -controlled study to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and 
tolerability in subjects with FRDA following the oral administration of study drug (a ctive or 
placebo  capsules).  
Subjects will self -administer the study dru g orally with meals. While on study drug, subjects are 
recommended to avoid eating foods high in PUFAs. Subjects will keep food journals from 
screening through the completion of month 1 on study drug. After month 1, subjects will keep 
2-week food journals prior to next scheduled onsite visit. Subjects (or parents/caregivers, as 
applicable) will have an initial call and as needed with the diet coach to discuss food journal 
completion requirement s. 
A total 60 FRDA subjects will be enrolled . Subjects will be randomized to active [9 capsules of 
RT001 (8.64 g/day) for the first month, followed by 6 capsules of RT001 (5.76 g/day)]  or 
placebo in a 1:1 r atio. Randomization will be stratified by FARS Neurological score: ≤45 and 
>45. Enrollment of patients with age > 25 will be capped at 25 % of the total enrollment. 
Subjects will self -administer orally 9 capsules daily for the first month with a meal: 3 capsules 
with breakfast, 3 capsules with lunch, and 3 capsules with dinner for the first month.  A fter this 
initial period the dose will be reduced to 6 capsules daily with a meal: 3 capsules with  breakfast, 
and 3 capsules with dinner for the remainder of the trial, while on study drug. If a subject is 
unable to tolerate study drug because of adverse events during the initial loading period, the dose 
may be reduced to six capsules daily (5.76 g total dose) given as 3 capsules with breakfast, and 
3 capsules with dinner.  If a subject is unable to tolerate study drug because of adverse events 
after the dose reduction to six capsules daily (5.76 g total dose), the dose may be spread over 
three meals (2 capsules at breakfast, 2 capsules with lunch, and 2 capsules with dinner). If the 
subject is still unable to tolerate study drug after spreading it over th ree meals, the total dose may 
be reduced by 1-2 capsules/day, preferably by reducing the dose for a meal from 2 to 1 
capsule(s) as needed. After 2 weeks of taking a dose of less than 6 caps/day, the subject should 
try to increase the dose to 6 capsules/day  given as 2 capsules TID given with meals. If 6 caps/day 
is not tolerable, the subject can take the drug at the dose of less than 6 caps/day that was tolerable.  The last dose of study drug will be taken at 4 weeks from Day 330 visit. 
Participation is anticipated to require 13 months. 
• Screening : Up to 30 days from start of treatment   
• Treatment Period: treatment for a 12-month period 
Safety assessments include physical and neurologic examinations, vital signs, 12- lead 
electrocardiogram (ECG) tracing , and clin ical laboratory tests (hematology, clinical chemistry,

Version 8.0 - Date: 03 Nov 2021  lipid profile, coagulation, and urinalysis) to identify adverse events (AEs). Adverse events will 
be evaluated for incidence, severity, and relationship to study drug.   
The first dose of the study drug will be taken on Day 1. Bioanalytical measurements will be 
performed to determine the concentration of D2- LA, deuterated arachidonic acid (D2 -ARA), 
nondeuterated linoleic acid (H2-LA) and nondeuterated arachidonic acid (H2- ARA) in plasma 
and red blood cells. Blood samples will be collected at month 4 (Day 120 ± 30 days), at month 8 
(Day 240 ± 30 days), and at month 11  (Day 330 ± 30 days). All s amples are to be obtained prior 
to dosing and prior to breakfast.  
Subjects will perform CPET on a stationary recumbent bike at Screening, on Day 1, Day 120 
(± 30 days), Day 240 ( ± 30 days), and Day 330 (± 30 days). Peak work rate and VO 2 MAX will 
be measured during  incremental exercise testing. CPET should occur after fasting (if the subject 
has had a meal/snack ) for a minimum of 2 hours, with neither caffeine nor nicotine for at least 
12 hours before testing. 
Subjects (with or without assistive device) will perform a T1MW and electronically measured 
T25FW  at Screening, on Day 1, Day 120 (± 30 days), Day 240 ( ± 30 days), and Day 330 
(± 30 days). 
CPET and the T1MW /T25FW should be separated in time to allow the subject to recover 
sufficiently before doing the next test. All tests should be done at approximately the same time 
and order for each visit.   
The FARS -Neuro and clinician- rated CGI  scale will be performed at Scree ning, on Day 1, 
Day 120 (± 30 days), Day 240 (± 30 days), and Day 330 (± 30 days) by a qualified physician or 
health professional who is trained on the use of the tool. The CPET examination should always precede the FARS -Neuro evaluation at all visits.  
A trained  health professional will also work with the subject to perform the speech measurement 
recording at Screening, on Day 1, Day 240 (± 30 days), and Day 330 (± 30 days). 
The FARS -ADL, SF -36, VAS  (for Fatigue), F atigue scale, Neuro -QoL s cales (lower extremity 
function and upper extremity function) and F all Questionnaire will be completed by the subjects 
at screening and at the visits on Day 1, Day 120 (± 30 days), Day 240 (± 30 days), and Day 330 
(± 30 days). The PGI -C scale and VAS (for Improvement of FA symptoms) will be completed 
by all subjects at Day 120 (± 30 days), Day 240 (± 30 days), and Day 330 (± 30 days).  
In between the clinic visits, subjects will also be contacted by phone by a study site staff member 
and asked questions relating to the PGI -C, F atigue scale, Neuro -QoL Scales (lower extremity 
function and upper extremity function), and questions 8 and 9 of the fall questionnaire . These 
phone ‘visits’ will take place monthly .
 A Speech Assessment Questionnaire will be completed by 
the subject and parents/caregiver (as applicable) at Screening, on Day 1, Day 240 (± 30 days), 
and Day 330 (± 30 days).

Retrotope, Inc.  
Version 8.0 - Date: 03 Nov 2021  Between clinic visits , subjects will be asked to keep a daily log (diary) documenting falls, nea r-
falls, stumbles, and fear of falling  (Screening through Day 330). 
Additional b lood samples will be collected  and stored for future biomarker analysis  on Day 1, on 
Day 120 (± 30 days), Day 240 ( ± 30 days), and Day 330 (± 30 days). These  samples are to be 
obtained prior to dosing and prior to breakfast.  
A final phone call will occur 4 weeks (+ 7 days) from the Day 330 visit to confirm date of last 
dose and accountability of final bottles. The site will also collect AE information and confirm 
any change in concomitant medication since the last visit . Any ongoing AEs at EOT  will be 
followed to conclusion or until stabilized. 
Two additional optional sub- studies will be  offered. The first is a 24hr PK Profile at steady state 
that will occur before or after the Day 330 visit. Immediately before or after the Day 330  visit in 
RT001-006, PK samples will be obtained  30 minutes to 1 hour before the morning dose; and 30 
min, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12 and 24 hours after the morning dose.  
The second optional sub-study is a 6 -month study to evaluate the washout blood levels of RT001 
after treatment in RT001 -006 is completed. Depending on the timing of entry into the sub -study,  
washout pharmacokinetic (PK) samples will be obtained at 7 days , 4, 12, and 24 weeks after the 
last dose to determine the trough concentration of deuterated linoleic acid (D2-LA), deuterated 
arachidonic acid (D2 -ARA), nondeuterated linoleic acid (H2-LA) and nondeuterated arachidonic 
acid (H2 -ARA) in plasma, and D2- LA, D2 -ARA H2 -LA, and H2- ARA in red  blood cells.  
8.2. Randomization  
The randomized, double- blind design of the study is intended to minimize bias on the part of 
subjects, investigators, and analysts. Subjects who meet all enrollment criteria and from whom consent has been obtained will be randomly assigned to receive one of two treatments (RT001 or placebo  capsules) following a 1:1 ratio . Randomization will be stratified as much as possible 
according to the FARS Neurological score ( baseline  FARS  score of  ≤45 and >45).  Enrollment 
of patients with age > 25 will be capped at 25 % of the total enrollment. 
8.3. Blinding  
Subjects and study personnel, including but not limited to investigators, study coordinators, nursing staff, clinical monitors, the Sponsor, and the Sponsor’s representatives, will remain blinded to the study treatment assignments (RT001 or placebo ). 
If there is a need to unblind the study drug assignment for a subject, the Princip al Investigator 
will discuss with the sponsor’s Medical Monitor. A separate unblinding plan will document the 
specific processes related to emergency unblinding.  Refer to Section  15.7  for a description of 
emergency unblinding procedures.

Safety and Tolerability o f RT001 in Subjects  with Friedreich’s Ataxia  
 
Retrotope, Inc.  
Version 8.0 - Date: 03 Nov 2021  The reason for unblinding must be documented in the source document for the subject . If a 
subject’s study drug assignment is unblinded, the subject should remain in the study and 
continue the protocol -specified follow -up evaluations.  
8.4. Safety Monitoring  
8.4.1. Safety Mon itoring  
The study site investigators assess each subject and record findings obtained during each visit. Subjects will be queried to report any observations, concerns or symptomatology, and a clinical 
assessment will also be made. This includes any evidence of disease ex acerbation and/or 
progression. Safety repo rts made during the study (see Section 15) will be promptly reviewed by 
the Sponsor’s M edical Monitor and processed. This includes reporting to the FDA according to 
21 CFR 312.32, “IND Safety Reporting,” and taking any action necessary to protect subject 
safety.  
8.4.2. Sponsor Safety Monito ring 
The blinded safety and efficacy data will be reviewed by the study monitor on an ongoing basis.  
This data will not be made available to the Principal Investigators unless changes need to be 
made to the protocol for safety reasons.  
8.4.3. Data Safety and Monitoring Board 
A Data Safety and Monitoring Board (DSMB) will be established  to review this study and 
provide recommendations per the DSMB Charter.

Version 8.0 - Date: 03 Nov 2021  11. STUDY  DRUGS AND OTHER MEDICATIONS , SUPPLEMENTS  
11.1. Study Drug Administration  
Subjects will receive instructions on taking the study drug with meals. RT001 should be 
administered with food, preferably at mealtime.  On clinic visit days all subjects will receive the  
morning dose of study drug in  the clinic.  
Subjects will self -administer orally 9 capsules daily for the first month with a meal: 3 capsules 
with breakfast, 3 capsules with lunch, and 3 capsules with dinner for the first month.  After this initial period the dose will be reduced to 6 capsules daily with a meal: 3 capsules with breakfast, 
and 3 capsules with dinner for the remainder of the trial, while on study drug. If a subject is 
unable to tolerate study drug because of adverse events during the initial loading period, the dose may be reduced to six capsules daily (5.76 g total dose) given as 3 capsules with breakfast, and 
3 capsules with dinner. If a subject is unable to tolerate study drug because of adverse events 
after the dose reduction to six capsules daily (5.76 g total dose), the dose may be spread over three meals (2 capsules at breakfast, 2 capsules with lunch, and 2 capsules with dinner). If the 
subject is still unable to tolerate study drug after spreading it over three meals, the total dose ma y 
be reduced by 1-2 capsules/day, preferably by reducing the dose for a meal from 2 to 1 
capsule(s) as needed. After 2 weeks of taking a dose of less than 6 caps/day, the subject should 
try to increase the dose again to 6 capsules/day given as 2 capsules TID given with meals. If 
6 caps/day is not tolerable, the subject can take the drug at the dose of less than 6 caps/day that 
was tolerable. The last dose of study drug (3 capsules) will be taken 4 weeks from the Day 330 visit. 
11.2. Prior and Concomitant Medications  
Stable, ongoing therapies will be permitted during this study. Any drug therapy initiated during the study should be discussed with the Medical Monitor prior to administration, if possible. Data on concomitant medications will be collected at each visit.  
Fish oils or other oil-based supplements should not be taken for the duration of the study. In addition, i f subjects have participated in prior therapeutic trials, they will need to have been off 
therapy for at least 30 days prior to receiving the first dose of study drug. Changes in herbal 
remedies and changes in prescription medications are strongly discouraged during the trial.  
11.3. Subject Compliance 
Compliance will be assessed through counting the number of bottles/capsules returned to the investigational site by the subject. T he site will contact the subject to confirm date of last study 
dose as well as to perform final drug accountability  during the EOT call . The subject will be 
given instructions on how to return any unused study drug/bottles to the site.

12.5.2.  Clinician -rated C linical Global Impression  (CGI) 
The CGI i s a 3-item observer- rated scale that m easures illnes s severity,  global improvement  and 
therapeutic response. T he illness severity i s rated on  a 7-point scal e, with the severity of illness 
scale using a range of responses from 1 (normal) through 7 (amongst the most severely ill 
patients). T he gl obal improvement scores ra nge fr om 1 (very much i mproved) throug h to 7 (very 
much worse). Treatment response ratings should take account of both therapeutic efficacy and 
treatment-relate d adverse events and range from 0 (marked improvement and no side- effects) 
and 4 (unchanged or worse and side- effects ou tweigh  the therapeutic effects). Each component 
of the  CGI is ra ted separately; the  instrument does not  yield a global score. This scal e will be  
evaluated at Screening, on Day 1, Day 120 (± 30 days), Day 240 ( ± 30 da ys), and Da y 330 
(± 30 days) . At scr eening  and Day 1, onl y the severity of illness (questi on 1) needs to be

clinically significant findings. A copy of the tracing should be retained as a source document. 
The Investigator will review each ECG and provide an interpretation of the ECG as to whether 
the ECG is: (1) within normal limits compared with Baseline and within normal limits for a 
FRDA population, (2) or abnormal with any clinically significant findings noted. Clinically 
significant changes will be recorded as AEs.  
Individuals with FRDA show substantial variance in ECG readings; typical ECG changes in 
subjects with FRDA may be assessed as clinically significant in other populations. Underlying 
disease must  be considered when evaluating ECG changes. 
12.7.5. Clinical Laboratory Te sts 
The following clinical laboratory tests will be performed at each site visit  [Screening, Day 1, 
Day 120 (± 30 days), Day 240 (± 30 days), and Day 330 (± 30 days) ] at a local approved 
laboratory . If the Screening and Day 1 visit are within 7 days (or le ss) of each other, the 
laboratory tests do not have to be repeated, unless to rule out any clinically significant findings. The safety laboratory tests,  and lipid profile should be performed in a fasting state: 
• Hematology : hematocrit, hemoglobin, mean corp uscular hemoglobin, mean 
corpuscular volume, mean platelet volume, platelet count, red blood cell (RBC) count, and white blood cell (WBC) count with differential (absolute).  
• Coagulation : prothrombin time (PT), international normalized ratio (INR), and partial 
thromboplastin time (PTT).  
• Clinical chemistry : ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin, amylase, lipase, 
calcium, magnesium, glucose, sodium, potassium, carbon dioxide (CO 2), chloride, 
blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and creatinine.  
• Urinalysis  (only at screening and Day 330) : dipstick test and a microscopic 
examination if clinically indicated.  
• Lipid profile: total cholesterol, high density lipoprotein (HDL), low density 
lipoprot ein (LDL)  and triglycerides.  
Women will be tested for pregnancy by serum pregnancy test at Screening and by a urine pregnancy test at subsequent visits (including EOT ), unless there is documented evidence 
confirming they are not of childbearing potential . Subjects should be counseled to avoid 
pregnancy for at least 30 days after all study procedures are completed  (see Section 9.4). A Urine 
Pregnancy t est is to be performed by the subject at home on the day of the EOT phone call

for plasma measurements and assessment in red blood cells at month 4 (Day 120 ± 30 days), at 
month 8 (Day 240 ± 30 days), and month 11 (Day 3 30 ± 30 days). Samples are to be obtained 
prior to dosing and prior to breakfast. Actual collection time points should be recorded and will be used for PK analysis. Best efforts to collect the samples at the planned time should be made.  
Protocol- specific instructions will be provided to each site in a Study Lab Manual for the 
collection, handling, storage, and shipping of PK (plasma and RBC) samples. The date and 
actual time each sample is collected will be recorded. Date and time of last dose prior to sample 
collection will also be recorded.  
Two additional optional PK sub- studies will be offered. The first is a 24hr PK Profile at steady 
state that will occur immediately before or after the Day 330 visit. At the time of the Month 11 
visit in RT001-006, PK samples will be obtained 30 minutes to 1 hour before the morning dose (pre-breakfast) ; and 30 min, 1, 2, 4 (pre-lunch) , 8 (pre -dinner), 12 (post-dinner) and 24 hours 
after the initial morning dose.  
The second optional sub-study is a 6 -month study to evaluate the washout blood levels of RT001 
after treatment in RT001 -006 is completed. 
Depending on the timing of entry into the sub -study, 
washout pharmacokinetic (PK) samples will be obtained at 7 days , 4, 12, and 24 weeks after the 
last dose to determine the trough concentration of deuterated linoleic acid (D2-LA), deuterated arachidonic acid (D2 -ARA), nondeuterated linoleic acid (H2-LA) and nondeuterated arachidonic 
acid (H2 -ARA) in plasma, and D2- LA, D2 -ARA H2 -LA, and H2-ARA in red blood cells.

All study visits, assessments, and procedures involving study subjects will be performed at a 
Sponsor-approved investigator site, and assessments and procedures will be performed by study 
personnel with the supervision of an Investi gator. All measurements and results obtained as part 
of the protocol will be recorded in the CRF. The Schedule of Events is summarized in Table  1. It 
is recommended, but not required that the procedures should be completed in the order that they are listed to avoid causing fatigue to the subject. Each site visit can be done over multiple days  as 
needed to accommodate for scheduling flexibility. Actual st art time s of all protocol assessments 
will be recorded.

Version 8.0 - Date: 03 Nov 2021  14. STATISTICS  
14.1. Statistical Plan 
A complete description of analysis populations and statistical methods will be provided in a 
formal Statistical Analysis Plan  that will be finalized prior to unblinding and statistical analysis.  
Analysis populations 
• All Patients Population : Any participant with any record in the database. This 
population includes both screening and randomized subjects. P opulation will be 
utilized for descriptive patient counts that include screening subjects.  
• Intent- to-Treat (ITT) population: All participants randomized to treatment.   
• Modified Intent- to-Treat (mITT) Population: All randomized subjects with at least 
one post -baseline efficacy evaluation will be included in the mITT population and 
will be analyzed as randomized. The mITT population will be analyzed for efficacy 
evaluations.  
• Per Protocol (PP) Population: For programming purposes, they will be identified as 
having no major protocol violations as identified separately by the study team and the Sponsor prior to database lock. Analyses of the PP population will be analyzed as treated.  
• Safety population: All participants who receive at least 1 dose of drug or placebo. 
Demographic data will be presented using descriptive statistics (e.g., mean , standard deviation, 
median, and range). Exposure to study drug and reasons for discontinuation will be tabulated. 
Safety analyses will use the Safety population. Safety variables will be tabulated and presented for all subjects who receive study drug or placebo  capsules. Adverse events will be coded using 
the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). The incidence of treatment-emergent AEs will be presented by system organ class and preferred term. Adverse events will be presented by severity  and relationship to study drug. Changes from Baseline in clinical 
laboratory parameters and vital signs will be summarized across time. Shift tables will be provided for selected laboratory parameters. Physical examination results will be presented in listings. 
Primary, secondary and exploratory efficacy analyses of the 11-month on- treatment period will 
use the mITT population and the per-protocol population unless otherwise specified.  
Change from baseline (CFB) will be analyzed by comparing the change between treatment 
groups using a mixed model with repeated measures (MMRM). The MMRM will compare the 
estimated change from baseline between treatments for the primary endpoint. This analysis will assess whether there is a difference in estimated CFB between active and placebo groups at 11 months.  
Page 65 
Protocol RT 001-006: A Rando mized, Double -Blind, Controlled, Phase 2/3 Study to Assess Efficacy, Long Term 
Safety and Tolerability o f RT001 in Subjects  with Friedreich’s Ataxia  
 
Retrotope, Inc.  
Version 8.0 - Date: 03 Nov 2021  The primary analysis will use the ITT methodology and an MMRM methodology with a random 
slope and intercept for each individual. Due to the small sample size the model will be optimized 
by implementation of two risk scores (baseline and slope) that account for multiple baseline 
covariates in one variable. The risk scores will be derived from blinded data using the GST 
change from baseline values and generated using the baseline model covariates (excluding 
treatment and visit; baseline risk score) or the bas eline model covariates*time interactions (slope 
risk score). The risk scores will be included as covariates in the model.   
To calculate the baseline risk score, the GST change score is regressed on the covariates listed below. Individual coefficients for the baseline risk score are multiplied by individual covariate values and summed. A separate slope risk score is calculated for baseline covariates interacting with time.  
The MMRM with primary outcome CFB value as the response variable will include the following covariates and fixed effects: 
• baseline risk score:  
• baseline score for GST  
• age 
• slope risk score:  
• baseline score for GST * time  
• age*time  
• Time (continuous) 
• Time by treatment interaction (time*treatment)  
• baseline score for parameter of interest (if not in GST)  
• site pooled by region (random effect) 
Model assumptions will be evaluated. If the parametric assumptions are evaluated as inappropriate or violated, rank analogues will be advanced.  
All secondary and exploratory endpoints CFB values will be analyzed using the MMRM described above. This analysis will assess whether or not there is a difference in estimated CFB 
values between treatment group and placebo at the 11- month model estimate us ing least squares 
means estimates from the MMRM model.  
Speech measurement reporting will be analyzed by a third party vendor. A separate report will be 
provided. 
Responder analyses will be run on MVO2 (primary), GST, T1MW, Peak Workload, mFARS, 
and CGI -C (functional assessment). Responder analyses ar e performed to illustrate the clinical 
meaningfulness of the relationship between treatment differences and efficacy outcomes on a per 
Page 66

Safety and Tolerability o f RT001 in Subjects  with Friedreich’s Ataxia  
 
Retrotope, Inc.  
Version 8.0 - Date: 03 Nov 2021  person basis. Responder analyses will be assessed at change from baseline cutoffs at the overall 
quartiles for each of th e three variables. Patients who die or are unable to perform the test during 
the study will be counted as non-responders. Patients who do not complete will be carried 
forward using the last observation carried forward and the imputed value at the study endpoint will be used for the responder analysis.  
In addition to summarizing the results for each relationship between individual clinical responses 
and treatment multiple clinical responses will also be correlated with treatment using the five 
GST component outcomes individually. Those who experienced the following combined clinical 
responses will be summarized in terms of counts and percent:  
• Improvement or stabilization on at least 1, 2, 3, 4, and all of the 5 responder 
endpoints. 
The PK of D2 -LA and H2 -LA will be characterized in terms of minimum and maximum 
exposure at steady state, based on a validated assay. The PK of D2 -LA and H2- LA in RBC, 
D2-ARA, and H2 -ARA also will be characterized in terms of minimum and maximum exposure 
at steady state; the validation of the assays to characterize these concentration values has not yet 
been validated. 
Full details of planned analyses w ill be provided in a separate statistical analysis plan.  
14.2. Determination of Sample Size 
For the primary analysis of peak workload, group sample sizes of 30 and 30 achieve over 99% 
power to reject the null hypothesis of equal means when the population mean di fference is μ1 - 
μ2 = 7.5 - - 8.3 = 15.8 with a standard deviation for both groups of 11.1 and with a significance 
level (alpha) of 0.05 using a two-sided two- sample equal -variance t -test. 
Subjects who discontinue from the study may be replaced.  
14.3. Interim Analysis  
One of two interim analyses may be performed. Retrotope will determine which interim, if 
either, to perform.  
Interim analysis 1 using Month 4 data. 
An interim analysis may be performed when all subjects have completed the Month 4 visit. The Interim Analysis Committee (IAC) will report the following information to the steering 
committee, which will report the information to Retrotope management.  
• The average within- treatment -group standard deviation of the change from baseline to 
Month 4 in CPET 
• The average within -treatment -group standard deviation of the change from baseline to 
Month 4 in mFARS 
Page 67 
Protocol RT 001-006: A Rando mized, Double -Blind, Controlled, Phase 2/3 Study to Assess Efficacy, Long Term 
Safety and Tolerability o f RT001 in Subjects  with Friedreich’s Ataxia  
 
Retrotope, Inc.  
Version 8.0 - Date: 03 Nov 2021  That is, for CPE T and for mFARS, the IAC statistician will calculate the within -treatment -group 
standard deviation of the change from baseline to Month 4 for each treatment group, and then 
calculate the average of the standard deviations of the two treatment groups.  
The IAC will not report the mean change from baseline within treatment group and will not 
report the difference between the treatment groups in the  mean change from baseline. 
Retrotope may use this information on average within- treatment -group standard deviation to 
consider stopping the trial for futility or to consider sample size re -estimation.  
The Interim Analysis Committee (IAC) will report the P earson and Spearman correlation of the 
change in CPET with the change in mFARS at 4 months, and at the last available time point for each subject. Retrotope may use this information to re- order the primary and first secondary 
analyses.  
There will be no alp ha penalty for this interim analysis for the following reasons.  
1. Only the average within -treatment-group standard deviations will be reported.  
2. Neither mean change from baseline within treatment group nor the difference between 
the treatment groups in the m ean change from baseline will be reported to Retrotope.  
3. Retrotope will remain blinded to treatment assignments.  
Interim analysis 2 using Month 11 data. 
An interim analysis may be performed when approximately half the subjects have completed the 
Month 11 visit.  
The Interim Analysis Committee (IAC) will report the following information to the steering 
committee, which will report the information to Retrotope management.  
• The results of a futility analysis for the CPET endpoint 
• The results of a futility analy sis for the mFARS endpoint 
Retrotope may use this information to consider stopping the trial for futility, to change the order 
of the primary and secondary endpoint, or to consider sample size re- estimation.  
The Interim Analysis Committee (IAC) will report the Pearson and Spearman correlation of the 
change in CPET with the change in mFARS at 4 months, and at the last available time point for 
each subject. Retrotope may use this information to re- order the primary and first secondary 
analyses.  
There will be no alpha penalty for this interim analysis for the following reasons.  
1. The trial cannot be stopped for efficacy at this interim. It can only be stopped for futility.  
Retrotope will remain blinded to treatment assignments.  
14.4. Deviation from Original Analysis P lan 
Deviations from the original statistical or PK analysis plan s will be provided in the final clinical 
study report (CSR) .

Safety and Tolerability o f RT001 in Subjects  with Friedreich’s Ataxia  
 
Retrotope, Inc.  
Version 8.0 - Date: 03 Nov 2021  15. ADVERSE EVENTS 
All subjects in the study will have FRDA and the Investigators will take the subjects ’ Baseline 
status into account  when reporting AE s. Investigators will also consider the underlying disease 
when designating relationship of AE to study drug, and if AEs are due to the FRDA disease, 
disease progression or symptomatology exacerbation . Common characteristics of FRDA  and 
RT001 treatment include the following: 
• loss of coordination (ataxia) in the arms and legs 
• loss of mobility  
• fatigue - energy deprivation and muscle loss 
• vision impairment, hearing loss, and slurred speech 
• severe scoliosis  
• foot deformities such as clubfoot, flexion of the toes, hammer toes, foot inversion 
• diabetes mellitus (insulin -dependent, in most cases)  
• hypertrophic cardiomyopathy 
• chest pain, shortness of breath, and heart palpitations 
• myocardial fibrosis  
• heart rhythm abnormalities  
• steatorrhea , diarrhea , loose stools  
All adverse physical findings/laboratory results identified prior to initiation of study drug will be reported on the medical history and/or physical examination CRFs. After initiation of study drug, any clinically significant chang es in physical findings/laboratory results or any new adverse 
physical findings/laboratory results will be reported as AE s.  
15.1. Adverse Event Definitions  
15.1.1. Adverse Event  
An AE means any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether or not considered drug related. An AE (also referred to as an adverse experience) can be 
any unfavorable and unintended sign (e.g., an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug and does not imply any judgment about causality. 
15.1.2. Suspected Adverse Reaction  
A suspected adverse reaction means a ny AE for which there is a reasonable possibility that the 
drug caused the AE. For the purposes of Investigational New Drug ( IND) safety reporting, 
‘‘reasonable po ssibility’’ means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the 
Page 69 
Protocol RT 001-006: A Rando mized, Double -Blind, Controlled, Phase 2/3 Study to Assess Efficacy, Long Term 
Safety and Tolerability o f RT001 in Subjects  with Friedreich’s Ataxia  
 
Retrotope, Inc.  
Version 8.0 - Date: 03 Nov 2021  drug and the AE. Suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser degree of certainty about causality 
than adverse reaction, which means any AE caused by a drug. 
15.1.3. Life-Threatening A dverse E vent or Life -Threatening Suspected Adverse Reaction  
An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered ‘‘life -threatening’’ if, in the view of either the 
Investigator or Sponsor, its occurrence places the subjec t at immediate risk of death. It does  not 
include an AE or suspected adverse reaction that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might 
have caused death.  
15.1.4. Serious Adverse E vent or Serious Suspected Adverse Reaction  
An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered ‘‘serious’’ if, in the vie w of either the 
Investigator or Sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes: 
• Death  
• A life -threatening AE - see definition above  
• Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization 
• A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions  
• A congenital anomaly/birth defect  
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospitalization may be considered serious when, based upon appr opriate medical judgment, they 
may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such medical events include allergic 
bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias 
or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 
15.1.5. Unexpected Adverse E vent or Unexpected Suspected Adverse Reaction  
An AE or suspected adv erse reaction is considered ‘‘unexpected’’  if it is not listed in the 
Investigator Brochure or is not listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed . 
For example, under this definition, hepatic necrosis would be unexpected (by virtue of great er 
severity) if the Investigator Brochure referred only to elevated hepatic enzymes or hepatitis. 
Similarly, cerebral thromboembolism and cerebral vasculitis would be unexpected (by virtue of greater specificity) if the Investigator Brochure listed only ce rebral vascular accidents.  
‘‘Unexpected,’’ as used in this definition, also refers to AEs or suspected adverse reactions that are mentioned in the Investigator Brochure as occurring with a class of drugs or as anticipated

with the particular drug under investigation. 
15.2. Adverse Event Classification  
15.2.1. Relationship to Investigational Drug 
The Investigator’s assessment of causality must be provided for all AE s (serious and non-
serious). An Investigator’s causality assessment is the determination of whether or not there 
exists a reasonable possibility that the study drug caused or contributed to an AE , as described 
below: 
• None:  No relationship between the experience and the administration of study drug; 
related to other etiologies such as concomitant medications or subject ’s clinical state.  
• Unlikely: The current state of knowledge indicates that a relationship is unlikely.  
• Possible:  A reaction that follows a pl ausible temporal sequence from administration 
of the study drug and follows a known response pattern to the suspected study drug. 
The reaction might have been produced by the subject ’s clinical state or other modes 
of therapy administered to the subject , but this is not known for sure. 
• Probable:  A reaction that follows a plausible temporal sequence from administration 
of the study drug and follows a known response pattern to the suspected study drug. 
The reaction cannot be reasonably explained by the known characteristics of the subject ’s clinical state or other modes of therapy administered to the subject . 
• Definite: A reaction that follows a plausible temporal sequence from administration of the study drug and follows a known response pattern to the suspect ed study drug 
and can be confirmed with a positive re- challenge test or supporting laboratory data.  
As this is a blinded study, it is assumed the event is related to the active study drug  until proven 
otherwise .

Version 8.0 - Date: 03 Nov 2021  15.2.2. Severity  
All AE s will be graded for severity using the following terms: 
Grade 1  Mild  Asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic 
observations only; intervention not indicated 
Grade 2  Moderate Minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age appropriate  instrumental ADL
a 
Grade 3  Severe  Medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; 
hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization 
indicated; disabling; limiting s elf-care ADLb 
Grade 4  Life threatening consequences  Urgent intervention indicated 
Grade 5  Death  Death related to an AE  
a Instrumental activities of daily life (ADL) refer to preparing meals, shopping for groceries or clothes, using the 
telephone, managing money, etc.  
b Self-care activities of daily life refer to bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, taking 
medications, and not bedridden. 
15.3. Exposure in Utero  
The subject will be instructed to notify the Investigator if the subject or subject ’s partner 
becomes pregnant during the study. The Investigator must notify the Sponsor within 24 hours via 
telephone or e- mail and  must complete the Pregnancy Notification Form and submit it to the 
Sponsor within 2 working days of being notified. The Investigator should obtain informed 
consent/assent from the subject or subject ’s partner allowing the Investigator to obtain 
information regarding the pregnancy and its outcome. If the subject  or subject ’s partner provides 
informed consent/assent, the Investigator should follow the pregnancy until outcome. A final Pregnancy Notification Form should be completed when the outcome of the pregnancy is known. 
15.4. Monitoring of Adverse Event Data 
The Investigator and the Sponsor or its representative  will be responsible for the following:  
• Reviewing AE data on an ongoing basis throughout the study. Should any AE report suggest that an unexpected Grade 3 or higher, and probably or definite study drug-related occur, the Investigator and Sponsor will take prompt and appropriate action to 
protect subject  safety. These actions may range from no action (proceed with the 
study) to halting the study for safety reasons. The evaluation and action decided upon 
will be documented .  
• Assessing the safe ty data and providing recommendations if the Sponsor should stop 
or modify the study.  
See Section  8.4 for additional details.

Retrotope, Inc.  
Version 8.0 - Date: 03 Nov 2021  15.5. Documentation of Adverse Events by Investigator  
Subjects will be evaluated and questioned generally to identify AEs  during the course of the 
study. Any events occurring prior to administration of the first dose will be recorded on the 
Medical History CRF. Events occurring after administration of the first dose of study drug will 
be recorded on the Adverse Event CRF. Ad verse event s that occur up to and including the 
90 days after the last dose of study drug must be reported.  
Record all AEs spontaneously reported by the subject  and/or in response to an open question 
from study personnel or revealed by observation, physical examination, or other diagnostic 
procedures on the Adverse Event Form for that visit. Any clinically relevant deterioration in 
laboratory assessments or other clinical findings is considered an AE and must be recorded on 
the Adverse Event Form. In addit ion, an abnormal test finding must be classified as an AE if one 
or more of the following criteria are met:  
• The test finding is accompanied by clinical symptoms. 
• The test finding necessitates additional diagnostic evaluation(s) or medical/surgical intervention; including significant additional concomitant drug treatment or other 
therapy. ( Note: simply repeating a test finding, in the absence of any of the other 
listed criteria, does not constitute an AE.) 
• The test finding leads to a change in study drug dosing or discontinuation of subject 
participation in the clinical research study.  
• The test finding is considered an AE  by the Investigator. 
Wherever possible, a specific disease or syndrome rather than individual associated signs and 
symptoms should be identified. However, if an observed or reported sign or symptom is not 
considered a component of a specific disease or syndrome by the Investigator, it should be recorded as a separate AE. Laboratory data are to be collected as stipulated in this protocol. 
Clinical syndromes associated with laboratory abnormalities are to be recorded as appropriate 
(e.g., diabetes mellitus rather than hyperglycemia).  
For SAEs, a Serious  Adverse Event Form must also be completed with as much information as 
possible and submitted in the time frame described below in Section  15.6 . When new significant 
information is obtained as well as when the outcome of an event become known, the Investigator 
should record the information on a new Serious A dverse Event Form , indicating that it is a 
follow -up report . If the subject was hospitaliz ed, a copy of the discharge summary and any other 
relevant hospital records (e.g., admission report, laboratory test results ) must be included as part 
of the subject  medical file.  
All AEs considered to be related (definitely, probably, or possibly related) to study drug and all SAEs will be followed until resolved or until a stable status has been achieved.

Version 8.0 - Date: 03 Nov 2021  15.6. Notification about Serious Adverse Events and Serious and Unexpected 
Suspected Adverse Reactions 
15.6.1. Investigator Reporting to Sponsor 
All SAEs that occur during the course of the study must be reported by the Investigator to the 
Sponsor and to the Medical Monitor within 24 hours by telephone or by text message. Additionally, the SAE Form should be faxed/e-mailed within 1 working day from the point in 
time w hen the Investigator becomes aware of the SAE. In addition, all SAEs that occur up to and 
including 90 days after administration of the last dose of study drug must be reported to the 
Sponsor within 1 working day from when the Investigator becomes aware of the SAE.  
Investigators must report to the Sponsor any SAE , whether or not considered drug related, 
including those listed in the protocol or Investigator Brochure. The report must include an assessment of causality.  
For all SAEs, the Investigator is obligated to obtain and provide information to the Sponsor in accordance with the timeframes for reporting specified above. In addition, an Investigator may be requested by the Sponsor to obtain specific additional follow-up information in an expedited 
fashion. This information may be more detailed than that captured on the Adverse Event e CRF. 
In general, this will include a description of the AE in sufficient detail to allow for a complete 
medical assessment of the case an d independent determination of possible causality. Information 
on other possible causes of the event, such as concomitant medications and illnesses must be 
provided. In the case of a subject death, a summary of available autopsy findings must be submitted as soon as possible to the Sponsor or its designated representative. 
The Sponsor’s Medical Monitor will review the information submitted and seek further detail if 
deemed medically relevant and ideally concur on the severity and relatedness. However, the 
Medical Monitor may revise the severity and relatedness upward but may not reduce severity 
and/or relatedness. Such revisions will be documented in the Sponsor file and provided to the Investigator.

15.6.2. Reporting to Regulatory Agencies and Institutional Review Board s 
If there is a serious and unexpected suspected adverse reaction, the Sponsor will notify the 
appropriate regulatory agency and all appropriate parties on an expedi ted basis. In addition, 
Sponsor must submit expedited reports of an increased rate of occurrence of serious suspected adverse reactions over  that listed in the protocol or Investigator Brochure (§  312.32(c)(1))(iv)). 
It is the responsibility of the Investigator to promptly notify the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of all serious and unexpected suspected adverse reactions involving risk to human subjects.   
Provide a copy of this communication to the Sponsor. 
15.7. Emergency Identification of Study Medication  
In the event of a medical emergency, when knowledge of the subject ’s treatment assignment may 
influence the subject ’s clinical care, the Invest igator may obtain the treatment assignment of the 
subject experiencing the emergency through the unblinded statistician /designee. However, prior 
to unblinding, the Investigator should make every effort to contact the Medical Monitor. 
If unblinding is necessary, the Investigator must document the reasons for unblinding in the 
subject ’s source documents but should not divulge the subject ’s treatment assignment to any 
individuals except the Medical Monitor  (if required) and those individuals involved in the di rect 
care of the subject . The date and the reasons for breaking the blind must be submitted to the 
Sponsor within 24 hours.  
If a subject ’s treatment assignment is unblinded, the subject should remain in the study and 
continue the protocol -specified follow -up evaluations. 
15.8. Optional Sub- Study Adverse Event Monitoring  
For the Optional PK Profile Sub-Study, there will be adverse event monitoring because this 
study will start and stop within the RT001-006 study dosing window. 
For the Optional PK Washout Sub-Study, there will not be any adverse event monitoring because 
the study occurs after the last dose of study drug. SAEs will still be monitored.

compare the original data and observations with the processed data. 
An unambiguous subject identification code will be used that allows identification of all the data 
reported for each subject . 
17.3.4. Retention of Study Records  
The Investigator must maintain essential study documents (protocol and protocol amendments, completed CRFs, signed ICFs, relevant correspondence, and all other supporting documentation) until at least 2 years after the last approval of a marketing application in an ICH region and until 
there are no pending or contemplated marketing applications in an ICH region or at least 2 years 
after the formal discontinuation of clinical development of the investigational product . These 
documents will be retained for a longer period if required by the applicable regulatory 
requirements or the hospital, institution, or private practice in which the study is being 
conducted. Subject identification codes (subject  names and corresponding study numbers) will 
be retained for t his same period of time. These documents may be transferred to another 
responsible party, acceptable to the Sponsor, who agrees to abide by the retention policies. Written notification of transfer must be submitted to the Sponsor. The Investigator or desig nee

19.1. Cardiopulmonary Exercise Testing as a Primary Endpoint in 
Mitochondrial Diseases 
19.1.1. Background 
Assessment of exercise capacity is useful in providing valuable diagnostic, prognostic, and 
therapeutic information in patients in a variety of disease states.  Exercise capacity traditionally 
has been assessed  in heart failure by the New York Heart Association criteria.  Such assessment 
is both subjective and insensitive.  The 6- minute walk test (i.e., the distance walked  over a period 
of six minutes) is less subjective than the New York Heart Association functional class but still 
can be heavily influenced by the patient’s and/or tester’s motivation.  Additionally, the results of 
the 6-minute walk test cannot estimate how close the patient is to his or her maximal capacity.  
Some form of quantitative exercise testing has been available for more than a half century and, 
like many other cardiovascular procedures, has evolved in its technology and scope.  Information 
regarding  a patient’s ECG and vital sign responses to supervised exercise on a treadmill or 
bicycle has long been used for diagnostic purposes in clinical situations.  It has also been used to 
predict prognosis, and on this basis, in the qualification of patients for therapeutic interventions.  
Used after such an intervention, it may be used to assess the resultant effects on symptom status or disease progression.  The quantitative assessment a patient’s exercise capacity provides a wide 
array of unique and clinical ly useful information.  Over time, the type of data collected,  and the 
analysis performed during exercise testing has become increasingly complex.  This complexity 
allows the tailoring of the type of exercise protocol used, the method and amount of data 
collection, and its analysis to the condition under study. 
19.1.2. What is cardiopulmonary exercise testing ( CPET)?  
CPET refers to the addition of gas exchange parameter measurement and analysis to 
conventional supervised exercise testing.  This usually entails a pr otocol administered stress test 
using either a treadmill or cycle ergometer (for either upper body or lower body exercise).  The 
protocol selected for administration may be tailored for the particular individual or condition 
under examination.  Under such conditions, the peak workload can be measured objectively and reproducibly.  Gas exchange analysis at rest, during exercise, and during recovery yields breath-
by-breath measures of oxygen uptake (VO
2), carbon dioxide output (V CO 2), and ventilation 
(VE).  Such metrics add utility to the peak workload analysis and may provide objective 
evidence of consistent effort when the anaerobic threshold is attained.  These data can be readily integrated with standard variables measured during exerci se testing, including heart rate, blood 
pressure, work rate, electrocardiography findings, and symptoms to provide a comprehensive 
assessment of exercise tolerance and exercise responses.  
The ability to perform physical exercise is critically related to the cardiovascular system’s capacity to supply oxygen (O2) to the muscles and the pulmonary system’s ability to clear carbon dioxide (CO2) from the blood via the lungs. The cardiovascular and respiratory systems 
work together to provide both a delivery syst em (of O2) and a removal system (of CO2) from the 
tissues. There are 4 processes that occur to make this happen:  
Page 90

Safety and Tolerability o f RT001 in Subjects  with Friedreich’s Ataxia

Version 8.0 - Date: 03 Nov 2021  1. Pulmonary ventilation, or the movement of air into and out of the lungs;   
2. Pulmonary di ffusion, or the exchange of O2 and CO2 between the lungs and the blood; 
3. Transport of O2 and CO2 in the blood; 
4. Capillary gas exchange, or the exchange of O2 and CO2 between the capillary blood and 
the working muscle.  
The first 2 processes are referred to as external respiration because they involve the movement 
of gases from the ambient air into the lungs and then the blood. The fourth step is commonly 
termed internal respiration because it involves gas exchange between the blood and the tissues. These 2 processes are linked by the circulatory system. CPET  is valuable because taxing the 
mechanisms responsible for external and internal respiration by exercise can frequently reveal abnormalities not apparent at rest. In addition, typical pulmonary and cardiac function tests performed at rest cannot reliably determine  exercise capacity or the particular mechanisms 
underlying exercise intolerance among individual patients with diseases affecting the heart, the lungs or the muscles ( Balady et al. 2010).  
Maximal aerobic capacity (VO
2MAX) is frequently cited as the single most important derivative 
of the CPET test because it is considered to be the metric that defines the limits of the cardiopulmonary system.  Although VO
2MAX is measured in liters of oxygen per minute, it is 
usually expressed in milliliters of oxygen per kilogram of body weight per minute to facilitate 
inter- subject comparisons.  The measurement of VO 2MAX implies that an individual’s 
physiological limit has be en reached (also termed maximal aerobic capacity).  Consistent 
attainment of this limit is dependent on the efforts of the subject and the administrator of any test of exercise capacity.  CPET has an advantage over most of these tests in that maximal effor t may 
be assured reproducibly when the oxygen consumption curve flattens at the anaerobic threshold.  
This also objectively assures the validity of other performance parameters made during CPET 
such as measurement of total workload.  
19.1.3. Conditions in which it is used clinically  
CPET may be useful in clinical conditions where exercise limitation occurs as a result of disease.  
For any appropriate disease in which exercise intolerance is a prominent feature, CPET may help 
to diagnose, identifying degree or stage, detect progression, predict prognosis, and guide 
therapeutic intervention.  
The value of CPET and its attendant data elements including peak workload and VO
2MAX has 
been recognized as the most objective method to assess exercise capacity in heart failure p atients 
(Balady et al. 2010). It is a useful test to determine the severity of the disease and to help to 
determine whether heart failure is the cause of exercise limitation (American College of 
Cardiology/American Heart Association recommendation Class IIa, Level of Evidence C), 
provide important prognostic information and identify candidates for cardiac transplantation or other advanced treatments (American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association 
Recommendation Class IIa, Level of Evidence B); facilitate the exercise prescription (American 
College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Recommendation Class I, Level of Evidence C) (Hunt et al.  2001); and assess the effectiveness of new drugs and devices.  V O
2MAX has been

Version 8.0 - Date: 03 Nov 2021  shown to predict prognosi s in patients with heart failure in many studies ( Davies et al. 2000 , 
Cohn et al 1993). In addition, there may be enhanced prognostic value from CPET testing in 
chronic heart failure by non- linear analysis.  Use of the oxygen uptake efficiency slope may add 
to the utility of the CPET testing ( Davies et al. 200 6). 
Peak workload and VO 2 MAX during CPET are also useful in the assessment of patients with 
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM).  In a retrospective review of 182 patients with HCM and 
minimal or no symptoms followed for up to four years, multiple parameters of metabolic exercise were associated with a risk of death and the development of severe sym ptoms. On 
multivariate analyses, the independent predictors of death and severe symptoms were the severity of the left ventricular outflow tract gradient at rest and the percentage of predicted peak myocardial oxygen consumption achieved during exercise.  ( Sorajja et al. 2012) In a more recent 
study of 1898 patients with HCM, VO
2MAX and several sub -maximal exercise parameters 
measured during CPET were predictors of death or need for cardiac transplantation ( Coats et al. 
2015) . 
CPET parameters are also used clinically in the evaluation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Reductions in VO
2MAX, and attainment of anaerobic threshold at lower levels of work 
performed correlate well with the degree of impairment due to emphysema, and with worse 
prognosis ( Chen et al. 2012).  
19.1.4. Association with morbidity/mortality  
Peak workload measured during exercise testing correlates well with functional capacity.  In 
patients with respiratory disease, peak workload is more closely associated with the distance a 
patient is ab le to walk over 6 minutes (6MWD-a common endpoint in heart failure and 
respiratory failure clinical trials) than it is with tests of respiratory function (Singh et al. 2014).   
CPET predicts poor outcomes and mortality in a variety of conditions including dilated 
cardiomyopathies (Mudge et al. 1993, Francis et al.  2000, Davies et al. 2000, Kleber et al. 2000), 
HCM  (Sorraja et al. 2012, Coats et al. 2015), congenital heart disease ( Diller et al. 2010 ), and 
pulmonary hypertension ( Miyamoto et al. 2000 ). 
19.1.5. Conditions for which it has been used as an endpoint in clinical trials  
CPET is useful in a number of different ways when used as part of a clinical trial.  
Determinations of peak workload and VO 2MAX have been used to qualify subjects objectively 
for enrollment and assessment of therapeutic effect.  Assessment of patient candidacy for 
enrollment in a clinical trial is fraught with sub jectivity among investigators. The use of a 
VO 2MAX threshold may be used to qualify patients for enrollment ( Abozguia et al. 2010) and 
may assure better uniformity, prevents unnecessary drug exposure to patients unlikely to benefit, and would potentially guide later application of perhexiline use clinically.   
CPET parameters are continuous variables which may improve trial effi ciency by allowing the 
identification of a significant treatment effect with a smaller number of patients required for 
efficacy analysis in rare diseases.  
In a study of 453 patients with advanced congestive heart failure randomized to control or 
cardiac re synchronization therapy, VO
2MAX was used as a secondary endpoint ( Abraham et al. 
Page 92

Version 8.0 - Date: 03 Nov 2021  2002) and correlated well with 6- minute  walk distance (primary endpoint).  Other studies have 
shown good correlation between these two endpoints ( Ross et al. 2010).  
Although t he majority of literature supporting the value of CPET in patients with heart failure 
has been performed in patients with systolic dysfunction, initial investigations demonstrate that 
CPET also has great promise in the evaluation of patients who have HFNEF—the kind of heart 
failure responsible for symptoms in HCM patient (Phan et al. 2009).  Patients with heart failure 
resulting from either systolic or diastolic dysfunction appear to have the same degree of impaired aerobic capacity ( Brubaker et al. 2003, Farr et al. 2008).  In subjects diagnosed with HCM, VO
2 
MAX and V CO 2 MAX at peak exercise are both significantly correlated with resting pulmonary 
hemodynamics ( Arena et al. 2008).  An abnormal response effectively identified subjects with 
pulmonary hypertension. Other investigations indicate the V CO 2 MAX slope, and VO 2 MAX 
may be significant predictors of adverse events in heart failure patients with diastolic dysfunction (Arena et al. 2008, Guazzi et al. 2008).  
VO 2 MAX has been shown in a pilot clin ical trial to serve well as a qualifier for enrollment and  
has been used successfully in determining a significant difference in V O2 MAX ( Abozguia et al 
2010).  Forty -six patients with symptomatic HCM and a V O2 MAX <75% of predicted were 
enrolled in a trial comparing perhexiline with placebo.  At the end of 4.6 + 1.8 months, V O2 
MAX increased in the perhexiline group (22.2+0.2 to 24.3+ 0.2 mL/kg/min) while it declined in 
the placebo group (23.6+0.3 to 22.3+0.2 mL/kg/ min; p <0.003).  These changes were associated 
with significant improvement in cardiac energetic status (measured by myocardial ratio of 
phosphocreatine to adenosine triphosphate using 31P magnetic resonance spectroscopy), 
improved diastolic function (measured by left ventricular diastolic filling at rest and during exercise using radionuclide ventriculography), and improved quality of life (using NYHA 
Classification).   
Thus, CPET and the parameters extracted from its performance play important roles in 
identifying patients at highest risk.  These metrics serve as continuous variables in the 
assessment of benefit from pharmacologic intervention in patients with heart failure, and have recently been shown to serve an identical purpose specifically in HCM.

For sitting posture patient can sit in a chair or examination table. For standing and walking assessment instruct patient to wear best 
walking shoes and record below if barefoot, footwear or AFOs used. Stance assessment begins with feet 20 cm apart. Place marker 
tapes in the exam room 20 cm apart and the insides of the feet are lined up against these. Subsequent stance tests get more d ifficult. 
For feet together the entire inside of the feet should be close together as much as possible. For tandem stance, t he dominant foot is in 
the back and the heel of the other foot is lined with the toes of the dominant foot but not in front of the toes (because thi s makes it 
even more difficult). For one -foot stance, the patient is asked to stand on dominant foot and the other leg is elevated by bringing it 
forward with knee extended; this gives some advantage to the patient. If a patient can stand in a particular position for 1 minute or 
longer in trial 1, th e trials 2 and 3 are abandoned. Otherwise each of 3 trials is timed and then averaged. Grading scores are then given 
as noted. Tandem walk and gait are performed in a hallway. Preferably no carpet but at least serial examinations should be on  the same 
surface. For gait place markers 25 feet apart. Patient walks the distance turns around and comes back and the activity is timed. Note if 
the gait was achieved with or without device and serial examinations should be done with the same device as in the first ex amination.

The objective of the study is to  evaluate the  pharmacokinetic (PK) profile  of RT001 at steady 
state.    
19.12.2. Study Design  
At selected sites, subjects who  are enrolled  in RT001- 006 will be invited to participate in  this 
study. At the time of the Month 11 visit in RT001 -006, PK samples will b e obtained  30 minutes 
to 1 hour before the morning dose; and 30 min, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12 and 24 hours after the initial 
morning dose. It is recommended that the blood draws are done on a different day than the study 
procedures for the Month 11 visit in RT001-006.   
19.12.3. Randomization  
There will be no randomization. All subjects who are volunteering for this sub-study will 
be enrolled.  
19.12.4. Blinding  
Subjects and study personnel, including but not limited to investigators, study coordinators, 
nursing staff, clinical monitors, the Sponsor, and the Sponsor’s representatives, will remain 
blinded to the study treatment assignments (RT001 or placebo) in RT001-006.   
19.12.5. Inclusion Criteria  
1. At selected sites, subjects who are enrolled in RT001 -006 will be invited to participate in 
this study.   
2. All participating subjects will be required to sign an informed consent prior to the 
collection of the blood draws.   
3. Subjects must be willing to stay overnight close to the study site and able to provide the necessary repeated blood samples.  
19.12.6. Sample Size  
Subjects who are enrolled in RT001-006 will be invited to participate in this study. Because the 
study treatment (active or placebo) in RT001 -006 is blinded, a minimum of 10 subjects will be 
enrolled to ensure that at least 5 subjects who are randomized to active are enrolled in this study. 
An unblinded person may be asked to verify that at least  5 of the selected  subjects were 
randomized to active. Additional subjects may be added as needed.

 19.12.7. Sample Collection   
Bioanalytical measurements will be performed to determine the concentration  profiles  of D2 -LA, 
D2-ARA, H2 -LA and H2 -ARA in plasma and red blood cells. Blood samples will be 
collected  according to the schedule below:  
Day 1 : Hour -1.0 to - 0.5 (pre -breakfast, pre -dose), 0.5 (± 5 min), 1 (± 5 min), 2 
(± 10 min), 4 (± 15 min) (pre -lunch), 8 (± 15 min)  (pre-dinner), and 12 (± 60 min) (post-
dinner) 
Day 2 : 24 hours following dosing on Day 1 (± 60 min; pre -breakfast, pre -dose)  
Actual collection time points should be recorded and will be used for PK analysis. Best efforts to 
collect the samples at the planned time should be made.   
Protocol-specific instructions will be provided for the collection, handling, storage, and shipping 
of PK  (plasma and RBC)  samples. The date and actual time each  sample is collected will be 
recorded. Date and time of the morning  dose will also be recorded.  The subject will only take the 
morning dose on the PK collection day.  
19.12.8. Timing of Meals and Study Drug  
The timing of the meals  and study drug needs to be planned in relationship to the timing of the 
sample collection. The subjects will need to  consume an in- clinic standardized meal (breakfast) 
which will be administered at Hour -0.5 and should be consumed within 30 minutes. Patients 
will need to take the mo rning dose in  the clinic, 30 minutes after the start of their breakfast, at 
Hour 0.  
Lunch can be eaten after the 4 -hour sample is collected. Dinner can be eaten after the 8 -hour 
sample is collected , but before the 12- hour sample is collected . The subject will only take the 
morning dose on the PK collection day.  
19.12.9. Data Analysis 
Bioanalytical measurements  will be performed to  determine  plasma concentration profiles  of 
D2-LA, D2 -ARA, H2 -LA, and H2- ARA.  PK parameters will include area under the 
concentration -time curve (AUC),  maximum observed plasma concentration (C max), and time to 
reach maximum plasma concentration (T max). Full details of planned analyses will be provided in 
a separate PK  analysis plan.

1. Study Rationale  
 
Cardiovascular disease is  the leading cause of death in the United States and in most countries 
around the  world.1 Heart failure, in particular, is increasing in frequency and is associated with 
high morbidity, mortality,  and economic cost.2 Heart failure with preserved ejection f raction 
(pump function) (HFpEF) accounts for  approximately half of all cases of heart failure and is 
associated with 35 -50% mortality over 5 years.2, 3 Unlike  heart failure with reduced ejection 
fraction (HFrEF) where several medicines and devices have bee n demonstrated to reduce 
mortality, no such therapies have been identified in HFpEF.4  This may be in part due  
to incomplete understanding of the underlying mechanisms of HFpEF.  
 
Recently, impaired myocardial blood flow reserve, reduced myocardial energy u tilization, and 
increased  myocardial fibrosis have been postulated to play important pathophysiologic roles in 
HFpEF.5  We and others  have demonstrated that HFrEF may be associated with altered 
myocardial energy utilization and “energy  starvation.”6  Howev er, there is limited data 
regarding “energy starvation” in HFpEF and the relationships  between myocardial blood flow 
reserve, energy utilization, and fibrosis in HFpEF are largely unknown.7  Therefore, the purposes 
of this study are to use non -invasive car diac imaging techniques to describe cardiac  
perfusion, energetics, and fibrosis, and their relationships, in order to better understand 
underlying  mechanisms in HFpEF.  
 
Specifically, we hypothesize that HFpEF is associated with reductions in myocardial blo od flow 
reserve and  energy utilization and increased myocardial fibrosis as compared to  gender 
matched hypertensive  and healthy controls. We will test our hypotheses by comparing 
measurements of myocardial blood flow  reserve, energy utilization, and fibro sis between three 
subject groups (HFpEF vs hypertension vs healthy).  Myocardial blood flow will be quantitated 
from 13N -Ammonia Positron Emission Tomography (PET) and  gadolinium enhanced cardiac 
magnetic resonance imaging (cMRI) both at rest and stress fol lowing coronary  vasodilation with 
regadenoson. Myocardial energy utilization will be quantified with 11C -Acetate PET imaging  
and myocardial fibrosis will be assessed with gadolinium enhanced MRI. Echocardiography will 
be utilized to  quantify diastolic func tion and myocardial strain.  
 
It is anticipated that the results of this proposed study will provide a foundation that will inform 
future studies  aimed at identifying novel preventive or therapeutic agents in HFpEF. In addition, 
the design of the study  affords opportunities to compare myocardial perfusion between PET 
and cMRI across a spectrum of patient  populations and obtain valuable normative perfusion 
data in an age group most likely to undergo stress  testing. Importantly, the findings may also 
help esta blish a role for regadenoson stress myocardial perfusion  
imaging in the evaluation of coronary endothelial function and myocardial blood flow in 
hypertensive and  HFpEF patients.

Specific  Aims 
 
Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is a m ajor public health problem. HFpEF 
accounts for half of all new cases of heart failure (HF), is increasing in prevalence, and portends 
a poor prognosis. Unfortunately, medical therapies with proven mortality benefit in HFpEF are 
lacking. The absence of effe ctive therapies is attributable in part to the poor understanding of 
the underlying mechanisms of HFpEF.  
 
Coronary endothelial dysfunction and impaired myocardial blood flow reserve are postulated 
to be important mechanisms in HFpEF. The delivery of oxygen  and fuel sources needed for 
myocardial performance is dependent upon myocardial blood flow. Impaired myocardial blood 
flow at stress can occur even in the absence of flow limiting epicardial coronary artery disease, 
may be a marker of coronary endothelial  dysfunction, and is associated with adverse 
cardiovascular outcomes.8  However, coronary endothelial function and myocardial blood flow 
reserve have not been well described in HFpEF.  
 
Experimental and clinical evidence suggests that myocardial oxidative m etabolism is impaired 
in HF. Impaired oxidative metabolism has been associated with HF with reduced ejection 
fraction (HFrEF). However, few studies have investigated oxidative metabolism in HFpEF and in 
particular, whether differences in oxidative metaboli sm exist between hypertensive patients 
and those with HFpEF.  
 
Myocardial fibrosis is regarded as an important mechanism for HFpEF. Increased  extracellular 
fibrosis has been observed in animal models of hypertension, human left ventricular 
hypertrophy, and  endomyocardial biopsies from patients with HFpEF. Hypertension is the major 
risk factor for HFpEF; however, it is unknown why some individuals with hypertension develop 
progressive myocardial fibrosis.  
 
Experimental evidence suggests that impaired oxidati ve metabolism contributes to 
myocardial fibrosis. In animal models of hypertension, therapies targeting oxidative 
metabolism have been associated with decreased LV fibrosis. Consequently, understanding 
oxidative metabolism and myocardial fibrosis in HFpEF is of biologic importance and may have 
therapeutic implications.  
 
In preliminary work, we have shown that we can quantitatively measure myocardial blood 
flow reserve, oxidative metabolism and myocardial fibrosis through non -invasive cardiac 
imaging. Myocar dial blood flow reserve can be quantitatively measured with cardiac magnetic 
resonance imaging (cMRI) and positron emission tomography (PET). The mono -exponential

 decay rate (Kmono) of 11C -Acetate determined with PET is a validated measure of myocardial 
oxidative metabolism. Fibrotic myocardium can be quantified using cMRI T1 mapping.  
 
We postulate that reduced myocardial blood flow reserve contributes to impaired oxidative  
metabolism and increased myocardial fibrosis in HFpEF. We propose to test the follow ing 
primary hypotheses: 1) Compared to healthy and hypertensive individuals, subjects with HFpEF 
have reduced myocardial blood flow reserve, 2) Compared to healthy and hypertensive 
individuals, subjects with HFpEF have reduced oxidative metabolism; 3) Comp ared to healthy 
and hypertensive individuals, subjects with HFpEF have increased myocardial fibrosis, and 4) 
Myocardial blood flow reserve is positively correlated with oxidative metabolism and inversely 
correlated with myocardial fibrosis.  
 
Aim 1. To comp are myocardial blood flow reserve in individuals with HFpEF versus those with 
hypertension and healthy individuals. We will enroll 60 subjects (20 HFpEF, 20 hypertensive, 
and 20 healthy) who will undergo cMRI and 13N -Ammonia PET to quantify myocardial bloo d 
flow at rest and during pharmacologic stress with regadenoson.  
 
Aim 2. To compare myocardial oxidative metabolism in individuals with HFpEF versus those 
with hypertension and healthy individuals. Subjects enrolled in aim 1 will also undergo 11C -
Acetate P ET imaging to quantify oxidative metabolism via the mono -exponential decay rate of 
11C-Acetate.  
 
Aim 3. To compare myocardial fibrosis in individuals with HFpEF versus those with 
hypertension and healthy individuals. Subjects enrolled in aim 1 will also un dergo cMRI with 
T1 mapping to quantify myocardial fibrosis.  
 
Aim 4. To assess the relation between myocardial blood flow reserve, oxidative metabolism 
and fibrosis. The correlations between myocardial blood flow reserve, oxidative metabolism 
and fibrosis w ill be evaluated.  
 
2. Study Design  
 
2.1 Study Design and Hypotheses  
We propose a cross sectional study to investigate the hypotheses that HFpEF is associated with 
reduced myocardial blood flow reserve, reduced oxidative metabolism, and increased 
myocardial fi brosis, and that myocardial blood flow reserve is positively correlated with 
oxidative metabolism, while both are inversely correlated with myocardial fibrosis. We will 
quantify myocardial blood flow reserve, oxidative metabolism and fibrosis using non -invasive 
imaging in 60 subjects (20 healthy, 20 hypertensive, and 20 HFpEF). In addition, clinical 
information and circulating biomarkers will be collected during the protocol. All protocols will

 take place at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. We will spe cifically test the following 
primary hypotheses (Table 1):  
 
1) Compared to healthy and hypertensive individuals, subjects with HFpEF have reduced 
myocardial blood flow reserve,  
 
2) Compared to healthy and hypertensive individuals, subjects with HFpEF have reduced 
oxidative metabolism,  
 
3) Compared to healthy and hypertensive individuals, subjects with HFpEF have increased 
myocardial fibrosis, and  
 
4) Myocardial blood flow reserve is positively correlated with oxidative metabolism and both 
are inversely corr elated with myocardial fibrosis.  
 
An important feature of the proposal is the inclusion of two control groups: healthy  
individuals and individuals with hypertension. This design not only maximizes contrast by 
evaluating healthy individuals and HFpEF patien ts, but also allows us to test whether a  
“gradient” of abnormal myocardial structure and function exists, by including a group with 
hypertension but no HF. This is of particular relevance because hypertension is the most 
common risk factor for the developm ent of HFpEF and may promote reduced  
myocardial blood flow reserve and oxidative metabolism and increased fibrosis prior to  
the onset of HF.

 2.2 Recruitment of Study Sample  
 
2.2.1 Cohorts Defined  
 
Heart Failure Preserved Ejection Fraction (n=20). HFpEF patients will be aged 50 years or older, 
have a physician confirmed diagnosis of HF, be symptomatic (New York Heart Association class 
II or III), with a LVEF ≥50% within the prior 6 months, and no prior history of LVEF < 50%. HFpEF 
subjects will have e vidence of elevated LV filling pressures by ≥ 1 of the following within the last 
6 months: invasive cardiac catheterization LV end diastolic pressure or pulmonary capillary 
wedge pressure > 12 mmHg, plasma B -type natriuretic peptide >100 pg/ml, or 
echocard iographic E/e’ > 15. HFpEF patients with known coronary artery disease (CAD)  or 
angina) will be excluded to reduce potential confounding. Patients with sign ificant valvular (≥ 
moderate stenosis or regurgitation), pericardial, or congenital heart disease, o r symptoms due 
predominantly to right heart failure and pulmonary arterial hypertension will also be excluded, 
as will those with an estimated glomerular fi ltration rate (eGFR) < 45 ml/min/1.73m2. HFpEF 
patients in acute decompensated heart failure requiri ng intravenous diuretics, hospitalization, 
or use of intravenous vasoactive medications will be eligible for screening, but must be 
compensated at the time of the protocol visit. HFpEF patients will be recruited through the 
Vanderbilt Heart and Vascular In stitute HFpEF program.  
 
Healthy (n=20): We will enroll volunteers matched on gender to the HFpEF group. Healthy 
subjects will be free of known cardiovascula r disease (HF or cardiomyopathy, CAD, valvular 
heart disease, pericardial disease, arrhythmias, stro ke, peripheral arterial disease), 
cardiovascular risk factors (hypertension, DM, tobacco use, dyslipidemia, family history of 
cardiovascular disease, CKD, a utoimmune disorder), or use of medications for cardiovascular 
disease or its risk factors. In additi on, healthy individuals must have normal cardiac structure 
and function, to be confirmed by conventional transthoracic echocardiography at the time of 
the s creening visit. We will use the “Research Studies” email sent to accounts at Vanderbilt 
University M edical Center and the Research Study Volunteer Program, a registry that enables 
identification of healthy volunteers.  
 
Hypertensive (n=20). We will recruit subjects matched on gender to the HFpEF group. Subjects 
in the hypertensive group will have a physic ian confirmed diagnosis of hypertension, but 
without known cardiovascular disease (as defined above). Hypertension will be defined as a 
physician confirmed diagnosis of hypertension, history of blood pressure >140/90 mmHg and 
treatment with ≥ 1 anti -hypert ensive medication. At the time of the protocol visit, the 
hypertensive subjects must have adequate blood pressure control, defined as < 160/100 
mmHg. Hypert ensive subjects with other cardiovascular risk factors (as previously defined) will 
be excluded to r educe confounding. In addition, hypertensive individuals must have preserved 
LVEF, defined as ≥ 50%. We will recruit hypertensive patients through several m eans, including

2.2.2 Inclusion/Exclusion  Criteria  
 
Subject Selection: Regardless of study group, any potential subjects with  contraindications to 
cardiac imaging or adverse reactions to echocardiographic contrast, 11C Acetate, gadolinium, 
regadenoson or its reversal agent (aminop hylline), or 13N -Ammonia will be excluded. Based 
upon the number of subjects needed for the study, w e expect the number of subjects screened 
and eligible will exceed the number needed to enroll. An important aspect of the 
inclusion/exclusion criteria is th e age requirement of ≥ 50 years old. The typical HFpEF patient is 
in the sixth decade of life or old er,9, 10 and therefore, in order to capture a representative HFpEF 
population, we will specifically target this age range. Recruitment will be monitored on an 
ongoing basis by the PI. The investigators’ research group has substantial experience recruiting 
participants into clinical studies and trials using the mechanisms outlined above.

2.3 Study Procedures  
 
Screening Visit : At the screening visit, which will take place at the Clinical Research Center, a 
medical history and physica l examination will be administered with eligibility for the protocol 
determined (Table 2) . A venous blood draw of will be performed for measurement of the 
complete blood count and creatinine to assess inclusion and exclusion criteria.  For healthy and 
hype rtensive subjects, an echocardiogram will be performed at the screening visit to assess 
inclusion and exclusion related to cardiac structure and function, if an echocardiogram within 
the previous 6 months is not available. If the subject fulfills the inclu sion criteria without 
exclusions to participation, a protocol visit will be scheduled through the Clinical Research 
Center (CRC).  
 
Protocol Visit : There will be one protocol visit during which the subject will undergo testing as 
outlined in Table 3 . After arrival at the CRC, the subject will undergo a history and physical 
examination. If any intervening medical events between the screening and protocol visits 
occurred that would exclude the subject from participation, then the subject will be withdrawn 
from  the study. A venous blood draw of will be performed for measurement of complete blood 
count, basic chemistry panel, B -type natriuretic peptide, and collection of plasma and serum for 
storage at -80⁰C for future assays of circulating biomarkers. If the sub ject is anemic 
(hemoglobin < 10g/dL ), or has an eGFR < 45ml/min/1.73m2 according to the Modified Diet and 
Renal Disease equation  then the subject will be withdrawn from the study. Women of child 
bearing potential will also undergo a  serum pregnancy test. If  the serum pregnancy test is 
positive, the subject will be withdrawn from the  study.   Eligible subjects will then undergo 
cardiac imaging as described below. For all imaging procedures, data will be deidentified with 
the exception of a randomly generated s ubject number, such that imaging data cannot be 
linked directly to subject data, particularly categorization as healthy, hypertensive, or HFpEF.

Echocardiography : At t he start of echocardiography, heart rate and blood pressure will be 
recorded. A registered cardiac sonographer will perform comprehensive 2D, M -mode, and 
Doppler transthoracic echocardiography following a pre -specified protocol. A minimum of 3 
complete car diac cycles will be recorded for each image. Images will be acquired using a Phillips 
IE33 (Phillips Corp, Andover, MD) machine and data will be stored digitally for off -line analysis 
using commercially available software (HeartLab, AGFA and Cardiac Perfor mance Analysis, 
TomTec). Quantification of cardiac structure and function will be performed in accordance with 
guidelines from the American Society of Echocardiography.11-13  In particular, LV size and wall 
thicknesses will be measured using the 2D method,  while LV volumes will be measured from 
the apical 4 and 2 chamber  views via the Simpson’s Biplane method. LV ejection fraction will be 
calculated as LV stroke volume/end diastolic volume. To optimize assessment of left ventricular 
volumes and ejection fra ction, intravenous echocardiographic contrast (Definity, Lantheus 
Medical Imaging, N Billerica, MA) will be given. LV mass will be calculated using the Devereux 
formula as recommended by the American Society of Echocardiography.14  Diastolic function 
will be assessed using mitral annular tissue Doppler e’ velocities, transmitral spectral Doppler E 
wave velocity and deceleration time, and the ratio of E and A wave velocities, as well as 
isovolumic relaxation time, and left atrial pressures (defined as E/e’).  LV systolic function will be 
assessed by LVEF, mitral annular tissue Doppler S’ velocities, and speckle tracking derived global 
longitudinal  strain and strain rates, which are less angle and load dependent when compared 
to LVEF and tissue Doppler analyse s. Our group has previous experience in quantitative 
echocardiography, including speckle tracking.15-18 
 
11C-Acetate Positron Emission Tomography for the assessment of oxidative metabolism. We 
will follow an established protocol for 11C -Acetate PET imaging  previously used within our lab.6  
An intravenous line will be placed in an upper extremity by trained personnel. The subject will 
then lie supine on the PET/CT scanner and  heart rate and blood pressure will be recorded at 
baseline and every 5 minutes. A l imited transmission CT scan of the chest will be performed for

 attenuation correction. 11C -Acetate (0.286 mCi/Kg) will then be injected intravenously and PET 
imaging will begin. ECG gated images will be acquired in list mode for 30 minutes and 
reformatted into images of 12 frames of 10 seconds each, 8 frames of 30 seconds, 4 frames of 
60 seconds, 2  frames of 300 seconds, and 1 frame of 600 seconds. The 11C -Acetate images will 
be processed following CT attenuation correction. If the images are uninterpretabl e due to 
factors such as patient motion, attenuation artifacts, and/or inability to accurately gate images 
with ECG, then the subject will be withdrawn from the study with attempts to replace the 
subject to maintain sample size. Regions of interest over th e LV blood pool and LV myocardium 
from the last image of the study will be applied to all preceding frames. Counts in the regions of 
interest will be determined and expressed as counts/pixel. The blood pool and LV myocardium 
activities will be plotted agai nst time. The mono -exponential clearance rate, defined as Kmono, 
will be determined by least -squares fitting of the linear portion of the time -activity curve. 
Kmono has previously been demonstrated to correlate with myocardial oxygen consumption.19-
21  As the rate of cardiac metabolism may be influenced by cardiac demand, LV efficiency will be 
calculated as the work -metabolic index (WMI) using the equation WMI = (LVSVI x SBP x  
HR)/Kmono, where LVSVI is the LV stroke volume index (stroke volume/body surface area), SBP 
is systolic blood pressure, and HR is heart rate.22  In addition, oxidative metabolism may be 
influenced by blood supply, and therefore we will also assess myocardial blood flow through 
cMRI and PET as described below.  
 
Cardiac Magnetic Resonanc e Imaging of myocardial blood flow and myocardial fibrosis. cMRI 
will be performed on a 1.5T Siemens Magnetom Avanto scanner (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany). 
Subjects will be scanned with a phased array torso receiver coil. Following localizer images for 
iden tification of the heart within the thorax, cine imaging (“steady state free procession”) will 
be performed to generate conventional 4 and 2  chamber views, as well as short axis images. A 
short axis “stack” of cine images from the base to apex of the heart will be obtained, from 
which LV wall thickness, mass, volumes, and ejection fraction will be determined. Typical 
acquisition parameters will be used: field of view 300x340mm, matrix 156x192, slice thickness 8 
mm, flip an gle 80⁰ with downward adjustment dep ending upon the specific absorption rate, 
echo time 1.1ms, bandwidth 930Hz/pixel, and at least 30 phases per cycle to maintain a 
repetition time < 50 ms. Parallel imaging will be used with generalized autocalibrating par tially 
parallel acquisition (GRAPPA) using an acceleration factor of 2.6  
 
Following cine imaging, myocardial perfusion imaging will be performed at rest following dual 
bolus (pre bolus =0.005 mmol/kg; main bolus = 0.05 mmol/kg) intravenous injection of 
Gadobutrol (Gd-DO3A -butrol : Gadavist , Bayer Healthcare Pharmaceuticals, Wayne, IN), as 
previously described.23-27  First pass imaging of the wash in of Gd -DO3A -butrol  through the LV 
myocardium will be obtained in 3 short axis imaging planes centered at the mi d LV at the level 
of the papillary muscles, the basal LV below the mitral valve, and apical LV. T1 weighted 
saturation -recovery turbo fast low angle shot (FLASH) gradient echo sequences will be used for 
myocardial perfusion imaging. All short axis images f or myocardial perfusion imaging will be

 acquired over 50 -60 consecutive cardiac cycles beginning with injection of the Gd -DO3-butrolA  
contrast. Typical acquisition parameters for first pass imaging will be used: field of view 
320x400mm, matrix 116x192, sli ce thickness 8 mm, skip 8 mm, flip angle 12⁰, echo time 1.1 
msec, repetition time 160 msec, bandwidth 930Hz/pixel, and parallel imaging with an  
acceleration factor of 2. Stress myocardial perfusion imaging will be repeated 15 minutes 
following the resting gadolinium injection. Regadenoson (Astellas Pharma, Northbrook, IL) 400 
μg will be injected intravenously over 5 -10 seconds, followed by 5 -10 ml saline flush over 5 -10 
seconds, as previously described.23, 28  Approximately 60 seconds following regadenoson 
injection, gadolinium will be injected intravenously using the dual bolus method with imaging 
performed as described above. Heart rate, rhythm, and blood pressure will be monitored 
throughout the imaging protocol. The myocardial perfusion index (MPI) will be calculated 
offline as the maximum slope of the time -intensity curve of myocardial enhancement according 
to the following equation: MPI = maximum slope  (myocardium)/maximum slope (LV cavity).6  
MPI has previously been demonstrated to be a valid tool for quantification of myocardial blood 
flow.29, 30  Myocardial perfusion reserve index will then be calculated as the ratio of stress to 
rest myocardial perfusion indices. Similar analyses will be performed to evaluate myocardial 
blood flow (MPI and MPRI) in t he subendocardial and subepicardial layers of the left ventricle.  
 
Myocardial fibrosis will be non -invasively quantified using cMRI.31  A short axis image at the mid 
LV will be obtained pre -contrast using the Modified Look -Locker Inversion recovery (MOLLI)  
sequence with imaging at the same level repeated at 10 and 15 minutes post intravenous 0.15 
mmol/kg Gd -DO3A -butrol  contrast injection.32, 33  The MOLLI sequence consists of 3 consecutive 
inversion recovery prepared ECG gated Look -Locker trains. Each  train  begins with an inversion 
pulse at a specific inversion time (T1= 100, 200, and 350 msec), after which multiple single -shot 
steady state free procession images will be acquired over consecutive heart beats. All images 
will be acquired with the same trigger  delay time in end diastole. Scanning parameters will be a 
field of view of 360x360mm, matrix 192x193, slice thickness 8 mm, flip angle 35, echo time 1.1 
ms, repetition time 2.2ms, GRAPPA factor of 2. Prior to the delivery of Gd -DO3A -butrol  
intravenous con trast, the “pre -contrast” T1 relaxation time will be determined. Similarly at 10 
and 15 minutes post contrast, T1 relaxation times will be determined. The T1 relaxation time 
has previously been demonstrated to correlate with the extracellular volume of fib rosis by 
histology.31, 34 -36  The percent extracellular fibrosis will be quantified using the following 
previously validated equation: λ x (1 – hematocrit), where λ = (ΔRImyocardium/ΔRIblood pool) 
where RI=1/T1 and Δ corresponds to the change in RI pre and  post Gd -DO3A -butrol  contrast.37  
In addition to T1 mapping, we will also examine late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) as a 
measure of regional myocardial fibrosis.31  At 10 -15 minutes post Gd -DO3A -butrol  contrast  
injection, short axis myocardial LGE imaging will be performed using both single -shot inversion 
recovery and phase -sensitive inversion recovery true FISP imaging acquired every other cardiac 
cycle. In order to select the optimal inversion time (TI), a TI “scout” will be acquired prior to LGE 
imaging,  using progressively longer TI times. The optimal TI time will be determined by visual 
estimation of when the myocardium appears the  darkest.6

13N-Ammonia Positron Emission Tomography for the assessment of myocardial blood flow. 
13N-Ammonia studies will be performed at rest and stress on a whole body PET/CT scanner as 
previously described.38  An initial transmission scan will be obtained for the purpose of 
attenuation correction. Next, rest imaging will be initiated in list mode upon injection of 25mCi 
of intravenous 13N -Ammonia with serial images acquired over approximately 15 -20 minutes. 
Approximately 50 minutes after the initial 13N -Ammonia injection (5 half -lives), imaging will be 
repeated following pharmacologic vasodilation with regadenoson (Astellas  Pharma, 
Northbrook, IL). As with the cMRI protocol, 400 μg of regadenoson will be injected 
intravenously over 5 -10 seconds, followed by a 5 -10 ml  saline flush. Approximately 60 seconds 
after the regadenoson injection, 25mCi of 13N -Ammonia will be injected  with PET imaging in 
list mode. Heart rate, rhythm, and blood pressure will be monitored throughout the imaging 
protocol. Myocardial blood flow and coronary flow reserve will be quantified off -line using 
FlowQuant  software ( Ottawa Heart Institute , Ottawa , Canada ). 
 
 
 
Reporting of clinical findings. As the imaging studies are being performed for research 
purposes, clinical reports will not be generated. However, if unexpected or previously unknown 
abnormalities of clinical importance are identified or urgen t/emergent conditions are found, 
these will be clinically reported to both the patient and the  patient’s physicians.  
 
3. Statistical Methods  
 
Aim 1. To compare myocardial blood flow reserve in individuals with HFpEF versus those with 
hypertension and healthy  individuals.    
 
Primary Hypothesis:   Compared to healthy and hypertensive individuals, subjects with HFpEF 
have reduced myocardial blood flow reserve.

Secondary Hypotheses:  
A) Myocardial blood flow is progressively impaired from healthy, to hypertensive,  to HFpEF.  
B) Myocardial blood flow reserve by Gd enhanced cMRI (MPRI) is correlated with CFR by 13N-
Ammonia PET.  
C) Subendocardial MPRI is lower than subepicardial MPRI in HFpEF.  
D) Subendocardial MPRI is progressively impaired from healthy to hypertensi ve to HFpEF.  
E) Myocardial blood flow reserve is positively correlated with LV diastolic function.  
F) Myocardial blood flow reserve is positively correlated with LV systolic function.  
 
 
Analysis for aim 1 .  Primary outcome: Myocardial blood flow reserve, as measured by MPRI 
from contrast enhanced cMRI first pass perfusion imaging and CFR from 13N-Ammonia PET 
perfusion imaging will be compared between the three study groups: healthy, hypertensives, 
and HFpEF.  The distributions of each within each study gro up will be assessed using 
histograms, Q norm plots, and the Shapiro Wilk test.  If normally distributed then analysis of 
variance will be used to test for differences in myocardial blood flow reserve between groups.  
If the p -value from the ANOVA is < 0.05 , then pairwise comparisons using unpaired t -tests with 
unequal variances will be made between groups using a Bonferroni correction.  If MPRI or CFR 
is not normally distributed, then a Kruskal -Wallis test and Wilcoxon rank sum tests will be used 
in place o f ANOVA and t -tests.  The null hypothesis is that myocardial blood flow reserve does 
not differ among HFpEF patients, healthy individuals, and hypertensive individuals.  We will also 
assess  correlations (Spearman) between myocardial blood flow reserve, age , gender, blood 
pressure, heart rate, and body mass index.  To account for potential confounders, multivariable 
linear regression models will be constructed with myocardial blood flow reserve as the 
dependent variable, study group as the primary independen t variable, with adjustments for 
age, gender, race/ethnicity, anti -hypertensive medications, systolic blood pressure, heart rate, 
body mass index, LVEF, LV end diastolic volume, and LV mass.  Prior to entry into models, 
variables will be log transformed, a s appropriate.  We will check model fit by residual plots.  
Missing data will not be imputed as we will attempt to replace subjects with significant 
amounts of missing data due to uninterpretable images, as detailed above.

Statistical power for Aim 1:  Using a one -
way ANOVA at p = 0.05, we present 
between group differences in myocardial 
blood flow reserve as assessed by CFR 
under different sample size and power 
scenarios in Table 4 .  We anticipate 
having 80% power to detect a between group difference (la rgest to smallest) in mean values of 
CFR of 0.87, using a conservative estimate for the standard deviation of 0.90 when compared to 
those reported for normal controls and patients with hypertension, 0.68 and 0.88, 
respectively.39  The between group differe nce in CFR is within the range of difference detected 
between normals (3.17 ± 0.68) and patients with hypertension (2.18 ± 0.88), previously 
reported.39  Of note even if sample size is reduced by 25%, we still anticipate having good 
power to detect a betwe en group difference of 1.05.  Therefore, using conservative sample 
sizes that account for potential dropout or uninterpretable images, as well as larger estimates 
for standard deviation than previously reported, we should have good power to detect 
plausibl e differences in myocardial blood flow reserve between HFpEF, healthy, and 
hypertensive subjects.  
 
Secondary analyses:   The secondary hypotheses are presented above.  In addition to testing 
the primary hypothesis for between group differences in myocardia l blood flow reserve, we will 
also evaluate for a significant trend across the three study groups using Spearman correlation.  
The relationships between myocardial blood flow reserve derived from cMRI (MPRI) and PET 
(CFR) will be compared by Spearman corre lation as well as intraclass correlation in all subjects 
and by subject group.  Using ANOVA, we will also assess whether subendocardial MPRI is lower 
in HFpEF as compared to healthy and hypertensive controls.  Similarly we will assess whether 
subendocardia l MPRI is lower than subepicardial MPRI among HFpEF subjects using paired t -
tests.  The relationships between myocardial blood flow reserve and cardiac function will also 
be evaluated.  Scatterplots and Spearman correlations will be performed with myocardi al blood 
flow reserve as the independent variable and measures of diastolic function as the dependent 
variables (mitral annular tissue Doppler e’ velocities, isovolumic relaxation time, transmitral 
spectral Doppler E wave velocity, and E/e’).  A nominal p -value threshold of < 0.05 will be used 
for all correlations and results meeting significance at the nominal threshold will be considered 
for follow up study.  Similarly, we all also examine scatterplots and Spearman correlations 
between myocardial blood fl ow reserve and systolic function (LVEF, mitral annular tissue 
Doppler s’ velocities, and global longitudinal strain).  For both systolic and diastolic parameters, 
we will perform multivariable linear regression analyses adjusting for age, gender, 
race/ethn icity, systolic blood pressure, heart rate, body mass index, LVEF, LV end diastolic 
volume, and LV mass.  We will also test for effect modification on the relationships between 
myocardial blood flow reserve and diastolic and systolic function by including multiplicative 
interaction terms in the linear regression models.  Prior to entry into regression models non -
normally distributed variables will be appropriately transformed.

Aim 2. To compare myocardial oxidative metabolism in individuals with HFpEF vers us those  
with hypertension and healthy individuals.    
 
Primary Hypothesis:   Compared to healthy and hypertensive individuals, subjects with HFpEF 
have reduced oxidative metabolism.  
 
Secondary Hypotheses:  
A) Oxidative metabolism is progressively impaired fr om healthy, to hypertensive, to HFpEF.  
B) Oxidative metabolism is positively correlated with LV diastolic function.  
C) Oxidative metabolism is positively correlated with LV systolic function.  
 
Analysis for aim 2 .  Primary outcome: Oxidative metabolism, q uantified by K mono from 11C-
Acetate PET imaging, will be compared between the three study groups: healthy, 
hypertensives, and HFpEF.  The distribution of K mono within each study group will be assessed 
using histograms, Q norm plots, and the Shapiro Wilk te st.  If normally distributed then analysis 
of variance will be used to test for differences in K mono between groups.  If the p -value from the 
ANOVA is < 0.05, then pairwise comparisons using unpaired t -tests with unequal variances will 
be made between grou ps using a Bonferroni correction.  If K mono is not normally distributed, 
then a Kruskal -Wallis test and Wilcoxon rank sum tests will be used in place of ANOVA and t -
tests.  The null hypothesis is that oxidative metabolism (K mono), does not differ among HFp EF 
patients, healthy individuals, and hypertensive individuals.  We will also check for correlations 
(Spearman) between K mono, age, gender, blood pressure, heart rate, body mass index, and 
resting myocardial blood flow.  To account for potential confounder s, multivariable linear 
regression models will be constructed with oxidative metabolism (K mono) as the dependent 
variable, study group as the primary independent variable, with adjustments for age, gender, 
race/ethnicity, anti -hypertensive medications, sys tolic blood pressure, heart rate, body mass 
index, LVEF, LV end diastolic volume, LV mass, and resting myocardial blood flow.  Prior to entry 
into models, variables will be log transformed, as appropriate.  We will check model fit by 
residual plots.  Missi ng data will not be imputed as we will attempt to replace subjects with 
significant amounts of missing data due to uninterpretable images, as detailed above.  
  
Statistical power for Aim 2:  Using a 
one-way ANOVA at p = 0.05, we 
present between group diff erences in 
Kmono under different sample size and 
power scenarios in Table 5 .  We 
anticipate having 80% power to detect 
a between group difference (largest to smallest) in mean values of K mono of 0.010, using a 
conservative estimate for the standard deviati on of 0.010 when compared to those reported 
for normal controls and patients with HFrEF, 0.006 and 0.001, respectively.  The between group

 difference in K mono is well within the range of difference detected between normals (0.060 ± 
0.006) and patients with  HFrEF (0.041 ± 0.001), previously reported by our group.6, 40  Of note 
even if sample size is reduced by 25%, we still anticipate having good power to detect a 
between group difference of 0.012.  Therefore, using conservative sample sizes that account for  
potential dropout or uninterpretable images, as well as larger estimates for standard deviation 
than previously reported, we should have good power to detect plausible differences in 
oxidative metabolism between HFpEF, healthy, and hypertensive subjects.   
 
Secondary analyses:   The secondary hypotheses are presented above.  In addition to testing 
the primary hypothesis for between group differences in K mono, we will also evaluate for a 
significant trend across the three study groups using Spearman correlat ion.  The relationships 
between oxidative metabolism and cardiac function will also be evaluated.  Scatterplots and 
Spearman correlations will be performed with oxidative metabolism as the independent 
variable and measures of diastolic function as the depe ndent variables (mitral annular tissue 
Doppler e’ velocities, isovolumic relaxation time, transmitral spectral Doppler E wave velocity, 
and E/e’).  A nominal p -value threshold of < 0.05 will be used for all correlations and results 
meeting significance at the nominal threshold will be considered for follow up study.  Similarly, 
we all also examine scatterplots and Spearman correlations between oxidative metabolism and 
systolic function (LVEF, mitral annular tissue Doppler s’ velocities, and global longitudi nal 
strain).  For both systolic and diastolic parameters, we will perform multivariable linear 
regression analyses adjusting for age, gender, race/ethnicity, systolic blood pressure, heart rate, 
body mass index, LVEF, LV end diastolic volume, LV mass, and resting myocardial blood flow.  
We will also test for effect modification on the relationships between oxidative metabolism and 
diastolic and systolic function by including multiplicative interaction terms in the linear 
regression models.  Prior to entry i nto regression models non -normally distributed variables will 
be appropriately transformed.  
 
Aim 3.  To compare myocardial fibrosis in individuals with HFpEF versus healthy individuals 
and those with hypertension.    
 
Primary Hypothesis:   Compared with heal thy and hypertensive individuals, subjects with HFpEF 
have increased myocardial fibrosis.  
 
Secondary Hypotheses:   
A)  Myocardial fibrosis progressively increases from healthy, to hypertensive, to HFpEF.  
B)  Myocardial fibrosis is inversely correlated with LV diastolic function.   
C)  Myocardial fibrosis is inversely correlated with LV systolic function.  
 
Analysis for aim 3 .  Primary outcome: myocardial fibrosis assessed by T1 relaxation times by 
cMRI will be compared between the three study groups.  The ana lyses for aim 3 will be the 
same as for aim 2, except that myocardial fibrosis, instead of oxidative metabolism, will be

compared. The distribution of T1 relaxation times, as a measure of myocardial fibrosis, within 
each study group will be assessed.  Base d upon distributions, ANOVA or Kruskal -Wallis tests will 
be used to identify differences between study groups and if significant p < 0.05, then pairwise 
comparisons with T -tests or Wilcoxon rank sum tests will be performed with Bonferroni 
correction.  The null hypothesis is that T1 relaxation times do not differ among HFpEF, healthy, 
and hypertensive individuals.  We will also check for correlations (Spearman) between 
myocardial fibrosis, age, gender, blood pressure, heart rate, body mass index, and resting  
myocardial blood flow.  To account for potential confounders, multivariable linear regression 
models will be constructed with myocardial fibrosis as the dependent variable, with 
adjustments for the same covariates described for oxidative metabolism above.  
 
Statistical power for Aim 3:  Using an 
ANOVA at p = 0.05, we present between 
group differences in T1 relaxation times 
(msec) under different sample size and 
power scenarios in Table 6 .  We anticipate 
having 80% power to detect a between 
groups differenc e (largest to smallest) in T1 relaxation times of 60 msec, using a conservative 
estimate for the standard deviation of 60 msec, which was based on a 51 msec SD observed in a 
HFpEF population (mean T1 time 381msec).41  The difference in T1 relaxation times is well 
within the range of expected difference based upon reported values for normals (459 ± 38) in 
the MESA study and patients with HFpEF (381 ± 51).32, 41  Of note, even if sample size is reduced 
by 25%, we still anticipate having good power to detect a  between group difference of 70 msec, 
which is still less than the clinical relevant difference of ~80 msec.  Therefore, using 
conservative sample sizes, accounting for potential dropout or uninterpretable images, as well 
as a larger standard deviation est imate than previously reported, we should have good to 
excellent power to detect plausible differences in myocardial fibrosis between HFpEF, healthy, 
and hypertensive subjects.   
 
Secondary analyses:   The secondary hypotheses are detailed above and evaluat e for 
progressive increases in myocardial fibrosis across study groups as well as the relationships 
between myocardial fibrosis and cardiac function.  The analyses for myocardial fibrosis will 
follow the same statistical methods to those described for oxid ative metabolism.  Myocardial 
fibrosis, as assessed by T1 relaxation times, will be the independent variable and assessed in 
relation to features of diastolic and systolic function as previously defined above.

Primary Hypothesis:  Myocardial blood flow reserve is positively correlated with oxidative

Analysis for Aim 4:  For all subje cts completing gadolinium enhanced cMRI myocardial perfusion 
imaging, 13N-Ammonia PET perfusion imaging, 11C-Acetate PET imaging and cMRI fibrosis 
imaging, the relationships between myocardial blood flow reserve, oxidative metabolism, and 
fibrosis will be evaluated using Spearman correlation.  To account for potential confounders, 
multivariable linear regression models will be constructed with myocardial fibrosis or oxidative 
metabolism as the dependent variable, myocardial blood flow reserve as the primary  
independent variable with adjustments for age, gender, race/ethnicity, anti -hypertensive 
medications, systolic blood pressure, heart rate, body mass index, LVEF, LV end diastolic 
volume, LV mass, and study group.  We will check model fit by residual plots .  Prior to entry into 
regression models non -normally distributed variables will be appropriately transformed.  
 
Statistical power for Aim 4:   We present different margins of error for the Spearman 
correlation coefficient based upon 
different sample sizes and 
correlation coefficients in Table 7 .  
Based upon a sample size of 60 
subjects, modest correlation 
coefficients of |0.40| to |0.50| 
would have 0.24 and 0.22 margins 
of error, respectively.

 Definitions of Serious Adverse Events  
A serious adverse event or reaction is any untoward medical occurr ence that at any dose:  
 
• Results in death;  
• Is life -threatening  
(Defined as an event in which the patient was at risk of death at the time of the event; it 
does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it were more 
severe.);  
• Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization;  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity;  
• Results in a congenital anomaly or birth defect;  
• Results in the development of drug dependency or drug abuse ; 
• Is an important medical event - 
(Defined as a medical event(s) that may not be immediately life -threatening or result in 
death or hospitalization but, based upon appropriate medical and scientific judgment, 
may jeopardize the patient/subject or may requ ire intervention (e.g., medical, surgical) 
to prevent one of the other serious events or reactions listed above.  Examples of such 
events include, but are not limited to, intensive treatment in an emergency room or at 
home for allergic bronchospasm and blo od dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result 
in hospitalization. For reporting purposes, Lantheus also considers the occurrences of 
pregnancy, cancer or overdose (regardless of adve rse outcome) as events which must 
be reported as important medical event s.) 
 
SAE Reporting to Regulatory Bodies  
 
Regardless of causality, all SAEs will be documented and reported to regulatory bodies, 
including the IRB as required by the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) 
Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice (GCP ).  Follow -up information for SAEs and information for 
non-serious AEs that become serious will also be reported in the same manner.  
 
SAE’s will be reported to the Vanderbilt Human Research Protection Program according to 
institutional  policies and procedu res. 
 
Study Withdraw/Discontinuation  
Patients who wish to be withdrawn from the study will notify the PI who will have any of their 
data that has not been used or analyzed removed from the REDCap database.  
 
Privacy/Confidentiality Issues  
 
Patient privacy and confidentiality will be protected by the usual practices of the 
echocardiography laboratory.  The confidentiality of patient data will be protected by

1.0 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
1.1 Study  Synopsis  
In this feasibility study, up to  140 patients undergoing elective thoracic surgery 
will be randomized to one of two arms to complete PRO (patient reported 
outcome) symptom monitoring. The two arms are 1) active symptom monitoring and 2) passive symptom monitoring. The participants randomized to active symptom monitoring will have alerts sent to their clinicians when their PRO symptom scores exceed baseline discharge day scores (when discharge day  scores 
are available) by 2 points or more, or when 'severe' or 'very severe' symptoms are reported . Participants randomized to the passive PRO monitoring arm will 
complete the same PROs as participants in the active monitoring arm, but will not have alerts sent to their clinician.  
 
The overall goal of this study is to assess whether collecting and monitoring patient -reported data is feasible as part of clinical care of thoracic surgery 
patients, and whether these data are useful for clinicians and patients. Among these 140 patients, a subset of approximately 40 patients and their 40 caregivers will be chosen to complete a semi- structured interview, if willing, to assess 
patient experience with monitoring experience.   
1.2 Background 
Patient -centered outcomes after surgery go beyond traditionally measured 
morbidity and mortality to include QOL [11]. Patients undergoing thoracic 
surgery strongly value communication from their providers about anticipated physical functioning post- operati vely [12, 13]. Patients who require thoracic 
surgery are older, have comorbidities, and have greater decreases in QOL after often morbid treatments compared to other patients [14]. Therefore, 90-day readmissions after thoracic surgery remain high at 18%, largely due to symptomatic adverse events including post-operative complications and new cardiopulmonary diagnoses [4, 15]. While symptom severity and physical functioning worsen for up to 6 months after thoracic surgery [16-18], pain and QOL do return to baseline by 12 months [19], suggesting a window in the first year after surgery during which PROs can be better monitored and managed. 
 
In non-surgical populations, management of patient-reported symptoms has been extensively linked to improvements in care delivery including readmissions. The NIH has developed a PRO version of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (PRO -CTCAE),  which is a validated library assessing the 
presence, frequency, severity, and interference with usual activities of symptoms. Responses are provided by patients on a 5- point Likert scale with recall being 
over the prior week [20]. PRO -CTCAE is feasible fo r use in a variety of patient 
populations [21]. In surgical patients, PROs have been used as clinical outcomes, for quality improvement, and as outcomes in comparative effectiveness research [22]. In thoracic surgery patients specifically, PRO assessment through weekly

  telephone surveys has demonstrated symptom improvement; however, items 
assessed were standard cancer -related and one surgical specific symptom. 
Further, only 60% of symptom alerts lead to intervention by clinicians [8]. 
 
Currently, PROs including symptoms and QOL are not routinely collected in thoracic surgery patients. Challenges include selecting a comprehensive, sensitive instrument, time and knowledge required to administer and analyze responses, and integration into existing systems for outcomes measurement [9]. Nonetheless, 
a pilot study integrated empirically selected symptom items from PROMIS with the Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) National Database [16]. The potential value of using PROs in perioperative care i s multifaceted and includes shared - 
decision making, increasing patient satisfaction, and prediction and improvement of overall outcomes [9]. Further research on effective implementation of thoracic surgery specific PRO instruments is required. 
 
1.3 Purpose and Rationale 
Patients undergoing thoracic surgery report maintaining independent physical 
functioning and quality of life (QOL) are important and influence their treatment decisions [1]. Research has shown readmissions, physical debility, and declines in QOL are common  after thoracic surgery but has not identified solutions to 
improving these problems [2-4]. The rationale of this research is improvement of 
the patient experience and reduction of readmissions through management of 
symptoms after thoracic surgery. 
 
A potential approach to managing symptoms after thoracic surgery is using patient -reported outcomes. Assessment of patient-reported symptoms and QOL 
has improved care in a variety of patient populations. Chemotherapy patients randomized to complete PRO ass essments at home with nursing alerts for 
concerning symptoms had fewer emergency room visits, hospitalizations, and better survival [5, 6]. In lung cancer patients, recurrence was detected earlier using PRO monitoring [7]. Few studies have been done using PROs to improve care in thoracic surgery patients specifically. One trial in this group demonstrated postoperative symptom severity decreased using PROs [8]. This proposal aims to build on prior experience with symptom self-reporting by optimizing a thorac ic surgery specific patient -reported symptom survey and 
rigorously testing its implementation. It is a reasonable expectation this patient population will complete the surveys, as they are highly vested in their post- surgical care. In addition, 2 UNC clinics have integrated PROs successfully, and a multitude of UNC research groups with similar patient populations have successfully piloted PRO studies. 
 
Specific gaps in knowledge on PRO use in thoracic surgery have been identified [9, 10]. Barriers include optimal instruments and timing for PRO collection,

utility of PRO monitoring to providers and patients, and association of changes in 
PROs with postoperative outcomes. To address these issues, this study will 
evaluate the implementation of PROs for symptom monitoring in thoracic surgery patients and to assess how PROs correlate to readmissions and declines in global QOL. The overall hypothesis of this study is that PROs can be used to identify opportunities for intervention in patients at risk for poor postoperative recovery.

Enrollment/Baseline Visit 
 
Patients at the multidisciplinary thoracic oncology clinic with plans for thoracic 
surgery will be approached for enrollment based on inclusion/exclusion criteria described above. An IRB -approved study team member will approach the patient 
to discuss study procedures, benefits, risks and obtain informed consent prior to any study procedures. The study team member will also teach the patient how to complete the PRO assessment using PRO Core.  
 
At that time, the participant will complete their pre -operative PRO assessment in 
a private area, which will include PRO surveys as well as demographic questions such as age, sex, and education . PRO survey responses will be reported using the 
PRO Core database. Paper copies of PRO surveys and source documents will be used if PRO Core system is inaccessible.  
 For patients who are found to be ineligible during screening or those potentially eligible during screening but found to be ineligible after contact, reasons for ineligibility  as well as basic demographics available in the EMR (e.g. race, 
ethnicity, age, gender, education level  if available) will be collected in PRO 
Core.     For patients who are eligible but refuse enrollment, reasons for refusal, as well as basic demographics available in the EMR (e.g. race, ethnicity, age, gender, education level  if available ) will also be collected within PRO Core.  
 
Discharge Day (Day 0) Visit:  
 
On the day of discharge (or the next business day in the case of late or weekend 
discharges), discharge day surveys will be activated in PRO Core by the study 
staff.   
 
A study team member will call or approach participant in their hospital room 
before or after  discharge to reorient the participant with PRO Core, if needed.

Semi -S
tructured  Interviews  
The PI will identify  patient s to approach for semi -structured interview . Interviews 
may also be done with selected participants ’ caregivers.  after the initial 
participant interviews have been completed . The caregiver interview guide, 
sampling frame and timeline will be submitted to the IRB once determined. Semi -
structured participant interviews will initially  be conducted between 14- 90 days 
post- discharge. Sequential interview s will be conducted with the goal to 
complete 10 interview  participants  in the 14-90 days post-discharge PRO 
monitoring phase. Once complete or if there are no more participants in the 14 -90 
days post- discharge phase, the participants will be chosen  purposively to capture 
patients with varying postoperative experiences  and low PRO survey completion 
rates . Patients who completed the 90-days post- discharge symptom surveys but 
are in long- term follow -up to 12 months post-discharge may also be interviewed 
to increase the sample size as the study nears the end of enrollment, as needed.   Interviews will be administered using  interview guides and will continue 
until thematic saturation is achieved, which will be defined by no new codes being generated to add to the codebook. Semi-structured interview duration is dependent on individual participant responses, but the duration is expected to be approximately 30-60 minutes. The sample size is anticipated to be approximately 40 interviews  with patients . An additional 40 interviews will be conducted with 
selected participants’ caregivers  for those participants  who agree to have 
caregivers  contacted.   The par ticipants who are asked to be interviewed will 
receive a $20 gift card  for their participation after completion of the interview .  
 
4.4 Expected  Risks  
 
Expected risks for this study are likely minimal and involve psychosocial harms such as emotional distress or embarrassment related to PRO questions and breach of confidentiality. PRO questions are similar to questions used in the clinical setting and therefore are unlikely to cause harm. However, should a patient experience emotional distress stemming from these questions, a psychology consult through the Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Support Program will be obtained. Risk of confidentiality breach will be minimized in several ways.  
 
Study data will be recorded and stored in PRO Core. UNC PRO Core provides a secure platform for the electronic administration of surveys and collection of data from mobile health devices customized to specific research and clinical care applications. PRO C ore data are stored in a secure enterprise -level Oracle 
database hosted by UNC Center for Bioinformatics, and web servers are also hosted by the UNC Center for Bioinformatics. 
 
Data transmitted between the server and end -users are encrypted using SSL, and 
all databases are encrypted. Only study team members will have access to data stored in PRO Core, and they will use their ONYEN to log in. Research team

6.0 UNANTICIPATED  PROBLEMS 
6.1 Definition  
As defined by UNC’s IRB, unanticipated problems involving risks to 
study subjects or others (UPIRSO) refers to any incident, experience, or outcome that: 
• Is unexpected (in terms of nature, severity, or frequency) given (a) the research procedures that are described in the protocol -
related documents, such as the IRB-approved research protocol and informed consent document; and (b) the characteristics of the subject population being studied; 
• Is related or possibly related to a subject’s participation in the research; and  
 
• Suggests that the research places subjects or others at a greater risk of 
harm (including physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) related 
to the research than was previously known or recognized.  
 
6.2 Reporting  
Any UPIRSO that occurs during the conduct of this study and that meets all three 
criteria listed in 6.1 must be reported to the UNC IRB using the IRB’s web- b ased 
reporting system. 
 
7.0 STATISTICAL  CONSIDERATIONS  
7.1 Study  Design  
 
This is a single center, randomized feasibility study. A total of 140 patients undergoing thoracic surgery will be prospectively enrolled and randomized in a 1:1 ratio. A random block method with blocks of 20 will be utilized to randomize participants to one of two arms to complete PRO (patient reported outcome) symptom monitoring. The two arms are 1) active symptom monitoring and 2) passive symptom monitoring. The participants randomized to active symptom monitoring will have alerts sent to their clinicians when their PRO symptom scores exceed baselines scores by 2 points or  more, or when 'severe' or 'very 
severe' symptoms are reported. Participants randomized to the passive PRO monitoring arm will complete the same PROs as participants in the active monitoring arm, but will not have alerts sent to their clinician. All partic ipants 
will be administered survey instruments to further assess quality of life including: EORTC QLQ30, EORTC LC13, PROMIS Physical Function SF 4a survey SF 4a. Additionally, in order to assess the feasibility of the PRO monitoring system, all participant s will be asked to complete a Patient Satisfaction survey. In addition, a 
subset of 40 participants and 40 caregivers will be chosen to complete a semi - 
structured interview, if willing, to assess patient satisfaction with symptom monitoring experience. The subset will be made up of a range of post- operative 
experiences and will be a fair representation of stud y population, including both 
16 LCCC 1945  
PI: Gita Mody, MD, MPH  CONFIDENTIAL 
UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA  
December  3, 2021  
  
  study arms. Participants will be chosen by principal investigator and eligible to 
participate in interview after 14 days of discharge  
 
The primary objectives are to determine 1) impact of PRO monitoring with symptom alerts compared to PRO monitoring without symptom alerts after thoracic surgery on post- operative quality of life 2) feasibility of 3 -month post- 
operative PRO symptom monitoring after thoracic surgery symptom monitoring eliciting a clinician response 3) barriers/facilitators of PRO monitoring after thoracic surgery through semi-structured interviews of patients. 
 
Secondary objectives include: 1) determining impact of PRO monitoring with symptom alerts compared to PRO monitoring without symptom alerts after thoracic surgery on post- operative readmission and mortality rates 2) determining  
feasibility of PRO monitoring after thoracic surgery in regards to monitoring quality of life.  
 
7.2 Sample Size and  Accrual  
We originally anticipate d 100-150 patients to be enrolled per year. A sample size 
of 66 in each group will have 80% power to detect a difference in mean EORTC scores of 10.000 assuming that the common standard deviation is 22.900 using two group t-test with a 0.050 one-sided signi ficance level. The target sample size was 
140 patients to allow appropriate block randomization in groups of 20. Based on enrolling about 140 patients, we  would be powered to detect an effect size of 0.437 
(difference in means of 10, common standard deviation of 22.9). Due to slower accrual in context of COVID-19, we anticipate enrollment of 100 -140 patients  
before funding ends. With 100 patients, we will have 80% power to detect an effect size of 0.501 (difference in means of 11.467, common standard deviation of 22.9). Power calculations were performed using SAS version 9.4 (SAS Inc., Cary, NC) using PROC POWER and a two sample means difference test.  
7.3 Data Analysis Plans  
 
7.3.1 Aim 1: Impact of PRO monitoring with symptom alerts, compared to PRO 
monitoring without alerts, after thoracic surgery on post-operative quality of life. 
 
Impact will be determined by comparing baseline quality of life to quality of life 
at the following timepoints: Day 14, Day 60, Day 120, Day 180, and Day 365 
post-discharge. QOL will be measured by administering European Organisation for Research and Treat ment of Cancer’s (EORTC) EORTC QLQ -LC13 and 
EORTC QLQ -C30. These surveys will be scored according to methods described 
in the EORTC scoring manual: https://qol.eortc.org/manual/scoring- manual.  
 
Student’s T and/or Wilcoxon rank sum tests will be used to perform bivariable comparisons of EORTC scores at each of the time points (baseline/pre- operative 
and Day 12, Day 60, Day 120, Day 180, and Day 365 post- operative).  
 
Additionally, a linear mixed effect model will be used to assess the average 
17 LCCC 1945  
PI: Gita Mody, MD, MPH  CONFIDENTIAL 
UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA  
December  3, 2021  
  
  change in EORTC scores over time amongst both groups, and the difference in 
average trajectory between them, after accounting for repeated measures and within - and between - subject variability. Both a random intercept and slope (for 
time) statement will be  used, and an unstructured correlation matrix will be 
applied. The random intercept and slope will allow us to assess the impact of symptom alerts while allowing for random variation in baseline quality of life and trajectories.  
 
If there are convergence issues, simpler correlation structures may be used (e.g. independent) or the random slope parameter may be dropped. Dropping the random slope parameter will mean we are assuming that there is no/minimal individual variation in traj ectory across patients.  
 
7.3.2 Aim 2: Determine feasibility of 3 -month post- operative PRO  symptom 
monitoring with  alerts.  
 
The proportion of completed symptom surveys (overall and in each arm) at 3- 
months postoperative will be calculated, as well as the proportion of participants 
who completed all surveys during that time. Chi-square, Student’s T, and Wilcoxon rank sum tests will be used to compare patient demographics, study arm, and surgery characteristics between those who did and did not complete all surveys to attempt to identify predictors of compliance. Multivariable logistic regression may also be used. 
 
Similar methods will be used to assess proportion of symptom alerts that generate a clinician response.  
 
7.3.3 Aim 3: Identify barriers/facilitators of PRO monitoring through  semi - 
structured  interviews.  
 
Patient and caregiver interview transcripts will be analyzed as they are collected. Transcripts will be coded using in vivo coding methods and a code book will be created. Interviews will continue until thematic saturation is achieved, which will be defined by no new codes being generated to add to the code book. 
 
7.3.4 Sub-Aim 1: Impact of PRO monitoring with symptom alerts, compared to 
PRO monitoring without symptom alerts, on post-operative readmission and 
mortality  rates.  
 
Kaplan Meier curves and Cox proportional hazards regression will be used to 
assess the impact of study treatment arm on 30 -day and 90- day emergency 
department (ED) visits, readmissions, and all- cause mortality, as well as 1 -year 
all-cause mortality. A linear mixed effect model will be used to assess the change 
in 2-year quality of life (described in Aim 1). 
 
Patients who are lost to follow -up will be censored at their last clinician/study 
interaction. Mortality will be treated as a competing risk for ED visits and 
readmission. This aim will be approached as an intent- to-treat analysis and will 
not require that patients used their PRO monitoring or had symptom alerts sent to 
18 LCCC 1945

  their clinician.  
 
7.3.5 Sub- Aim 2: Determine the feasibility of PRO monitoring for  assessing 
quality of life. 
 
Similar methods to Aim 2 will be used. The proportion of completed QOL 
surveys (overall and in each arm) at each time point (baseline/pre-operative and 2- weeks, 6 -months, 1-year, and 2-year post- operative) will be calculated, as well as 
the proportion of participants who completed all surveys during that time. Chi- square, Student’s T, and Wilcoxon rank sum tests will be used to compare patient demographics, study arm, and surgery characteristics between those who did and did not complete all surveys to attempt to identify predictors of compliance. Multivariable logistic regression may also be used. 
 
7.4 Data  Management/Audit  
PRO data will be collected and managed via PRO -Core’s web -based 
administration systems. Satisfaction survey data will also be entered into the  
PRO -Core database via web -based administration. Abstracted medical record data 
will be entered into a PRO -Core study- specific database. PRO -Core employs a 
secure enterprise- level Oracle database managed by the ITS Research Computing 
group at UNC, and web servers are hosted by the UNC Center for Bioinformatics. 
Data transmitted between the server and end -users are encrypted using SSL, and 
all databases are encrypted.  
 
CHAI Core  and/or TS- PRO s tudy team member(s) trained in qualitative 
interview  will conduct all semi-structured interviews with patient and caregiver 
participants. Each interview will be audio recorded digitally and transcribed 
verbatim. The interview recordings and transcripts will be stored in a study- specific password -protected folder. 
 
The Principal Investigator will provide continuous monitoring of patient safety in this trial with periodic reporting to the Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) as required.  
 
Meetings/teleconferences will be held at a frequency dependent on study accrual, and in consultation with the study Biostatistician. At these meetings, the research team will discuss all issues relevant to study progress, including enrollment, safety, regu latory, data collection, etc. and the team will produce summaries or 
minutes of these meetings. These summaries will be available for inspection when requested by any of the regulatory bodies charged with the safety of human subjects and the integrity of data including, but not limited to, the oversight (Office of Human Research Ethics (OHRE) Biomedical IRB, the Oncology Protocol Review Committee (PRC) or the North Carolina TraCS Institute Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB). 
 
8.0 STUDY  MANAGEMENT  
19 LCCC 1945  
PI: Gita Mody, MD, MPH  CONFIDENTIAL 
UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA  
December  3, 2021  
  
  8.1 Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approval and Consent  
It is expected that the IRB will have the proper representation and function in 
accordance with federally mandated regulations. The IRB should approve the consent form and protocol. 
 
In obtaining and documenting informed consent, the investigator should comply with the applicable regulatory requirement(s), and should adhere to Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and to ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.  
 
Before recruitment and enrollment onto this study, the patient will be given a full explanation of the study and will be given the opportunity to review the consent form. Each consent form must include all the relevant elements currently required by the FDA Regulations and local or state regulations. Once this essential information has been provided to the patient and the investigator is assured that the patient understands the implications of participating in the study, the patient will be asked to give consent to participate in the study by signing an IRB-approved consent form. 
 
Prior to a patient’s participation in the trial, the written informed consent form should be signed and personally dated by the patient and by the person who conducted the informed consent discussion. 
 
8.2 Required  Documentation 
Before the study can be initiated at any site, the following documentation must be provided 
to the Office of Clinical & Translational Research (OCTR) at the University of North 
Carolina. 
• A copy of the official IRB approval letter for the protocol  
• A copy of the IRB approved consent form  
8.3 Registration Procedures  
All subjects must be registered with the Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, 
and entered into the web based clinical research platform, Oncore®. Patient 
enrollment will also be documented in a password protected excel spread sheet 
stored on a shared drive managed by Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center’s encrypted server. 
 
8.4 Adherence to the Protocol  
Except for an emergency situation in which proper care for the protection, safety, and well -being of the study patient requires alternative treatment, the study shall 
be conducted exactly as described in the approved protocol. 
 
8.4.1 Emergency  Modifications 
UNC investigators may implement a deviation from, or a change of, the protocol to eliminate an immediate hazard(s) to trial subjects without prior UNC IRB approval. 
 
For any such emergency modification implemented, a UNC IRB  modification 
20 LCCC 1945  
PI: Gita Mody, MD, MPH  CONFIDENTIAL 
UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA  
December  3, 2021  
  
  form must be completed by UNC Research Personnel within five (5) business 
days of making the change.  
 
8.4.2 Single Patient/Subject  Exceptions  
Eligibility single subject exceptions are not permitted for Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center Investigator Initiated Trials under any circumstances. Other types of single subject exceptions may be allowed if proper regulatory review has been completed in accordance with Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center’s Single Subject Exceptions Policy. 
 
8.4.3 Other Protocol  Deviations/Violations  
According to UNC’s IRB, a protocol deviation is any unplanned variance from an 
IRB approved protocol that: 
• I s generally noted or recognized after it occurs  
• Has no substantive effect on the risks to research participants  
• Has no substantive effect on the scientific integrity of the research plan or the value of the data collected  
• Did not result from willful or knowing misconduct on the part of the investigator(s). 
 
An unplanned protocol variance is considered a violation if the variance meets 
any of the following criteria: 
• H as harmed or increased the risk of harm to one or more research 
participants.  
• Has damaged the scientific integrity of the data collected for the study. 
• Results from willful or knowing misconduct on the part of the 
investigator(s). 
• Demonstrates serious or continuing noncompliance with federal 
regulations, State laws, or University  policies.  
 
If a deviation or violation occurs please follow the guidelines below: 
 
Protocol Deviations: UNC personnel will record the deviation in OnCore® (or 
other appropriate database set up for the study), and report to any sponsor or data 
and safety monitoring committee in accordance with their policies. Deviations 
should be summarized and reported to the IRB at the time of continuing review. Participant -initiated changes from recommended symptom monitoring schedule 
(ie- non-adherence) will not be considered protocol deviations. A protocol 
deviation would only be recorded if the staff and its systems (i.e. PRO Core) did not initiate/reach out to patients to administer the appropriate surveys or deliver appropriate alerts .  
 
 
Events will be documented in On Core, but not reported to the IRB unless it is due 
to a related AE or SAE.  UNC personnel will record the deviation in OnCore®, and 
report to any sponsor or data and safety monitoring committee in accordance with their policies.  
 
 
21 LCCC 1945  
PI: Gita Mody, MD, MPH  CONFIDENTIAL 
UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA  
December  3, 2021  
  
  Protocol Violations: Violations should be reported by UNC personnel within one 
(1) week of the investigator becoming aware of the event using the same IRB online mechanism used to report UPIRSO. 
 
Unanticipated Problems Involving Risks to Subjects or Others (UPIRSO): 
Any events that meet the criteria for “Unanticipated Problems” as defined by 
UNC’s IRB (see sectio n 6.1) must be reported by the Study Coordinator using the 
IRB’s web -based reporting system.
 
8.5 Amendments to the  Protocol  
Should amendments to the protocol be required, the amendments will be 
originated and documented by the Principal Investigator at UNC. It should also be noted that when an amendment to the protocol substantially alters the study design or the potential risk to the patient, a revised consent form might be required. 
 
The written amendment, and if required the amended consent form, must be sent to UNC’s IRB for approval prior to implementation. 
 
8.6 Record  Retention  
Study documentation includes all Case Report Forms, data correction forms or queries, source documents, Sponsor-Investigator correspondence, monitoring logs/letters, and regulatory documents (e.g., protocol and amendments, IRB correspondence and approval, signed patient consent forms). 
 
Source documents include all recordings of observations or notations of clinical activities and all reports and records necessary for the evaluation and reconstruction of the clinical research study.  
 
Government agency regulations and directives require that all study documentation pertaining to the conduct of a clinical trial must be retained by the study investigator. In the case of a study with a drug seeking regulatory approval and marketing, these documents shall be retained for at least two years after the last approval of marketing application in an International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) region. In all other cases, study documents should be kept on file until three years after the completion and final study report of this investigational study. 
 
8.7 Obligations of Investigators 
The Principal Investigator is responsible for the conduct of the clinical trial at the site in accordance with Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations and/or the Declaration of Helsinki. The Principal Investigator is responsible for personally overseeing the treatment of all study patients. The Principal 
Investigator must assure that all study site personnel, including sub-investigators and other study staff members, adhere to the study protocol and all FDA/GCP/NCI regulations and guidelines regarding clinical trials both during and after study completion.

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 4 STUDY DESIGN This is a Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-
controlled, parallel-group study. 
Patients taking a sulfonylurea ( ≥half the maximum recommended dose as 
per local label or maximum tolerated dose [documented]) as monotherapy or 
in combination with metformin ( ≥1500 mg per day or maximum tolerated 
dose [documented]) each at a stable dose for at least 12 weeks before 
enrollment will be eligible for Screening. The number of patients taking a sulfonylurea and metformin will be limited to 330 patients, to ensure sufficient numbers of sulfonylurea monotherapy patients. 
All patients will have a Screening Period comprised of an up to 2-week 
Screening phase and a 2-week, single-b lind placebo Run-in phase prior to 
randomization. In order to qualify for randomization, patients must demonstrate compliance based upon tablet count ( ≥80%) during the Run-in 
phase. 
Randomization will be stratified by:  
• HbA1c at Screening ( ≤8.5%, >8.5%) 
• Metformin use at Screening (Yes, No) 
• SBP at Screening (<130 mmHg, ≥130 mmHg) 
Following randomization, patients will have a 26-week, double-blind Core 
Treatment Period, a 53-week double-b lind Extension Period, and a 2-week 
post-treatment Follow-up Visit. 
Patients will be randomly assigned 1:1 to 1 of the following 2 treatment 
groups: 
• Sotagliflozin 400 mg as two (2) 200 mg tablets, once daily 
• Placebo as two (2) placebo tablets (identical to sotagliflozin in appearance), once daily 
HbA1c and FPG will be masked to study sites and patients after 
randomization. Additionally, urinalysi s by dipstick will not include the 
measurement of urine glucose.  
Early termination If a patient discontinues treatment wit h investigational medicinal product 
(IMP) early during the double-blind Co re Treatment Period or the double-
blind Extension Period, the patient will have a Premature End-of-Treatment 
(EOT) Visit and a Follow-up Visit 2 weeks after the last dose of IMP. In 
addition, every effort will be made to have all patients return to the site at the 
time corresponding to their scheduled visi ts, particularly the Week 26 Visit 
and Week 79 Visit  emphasizing the collection of primary and main secondary endpoints. 
If a patient does not agree to site visits, he/she will be contacted by 
telephone to inquire about their safety stat us, particularly at the time of the 
initially scheduled Week 79 Visit. 
The study design is presented graphically at the end of the synopsis.

STUDY TREATMENTS  
Investigational medicinal products • Sotagliflozin 400 mg as two (2) 200 mg tablets, once daily, before the first meal of the day 
• Placebo as two (2) placebo tablets (identical to sotagliflozin 200 
mg tablets in appearance), once daily, before the first meal of the 
day 
Noninvestigational medicinal  
products  • Sulfonylurea tablets administered as per Principal Investigator 
• Metformin tablets, administered as per Principal Investigator 
• The doses of sulfonylurea and metformin should be maintained 
stable throughout the study unless down-titration is required for 
safety reasons 
• Rescue therapy (see Rescue therapy section, below) 
 Rescue therapy 
The threshold values are defined as follows, depending on study period: 
• FPG >270 mg/dL (15.0 mmol/L) from Randomization up through 
the scheduled Week 8 visit 
• FPG >240 mg/dL (13.3 mmol/L) after the Week 8 visit up through 
the scheduled Week 12 visit 
• FPG >200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) after the Week 12 visit through 
the end of the 26-week Core Treatment Period 
• FPG >170 mg/dL (9.4 mmol/L) or HbA1c ≥8.0% after the Week 26 
Visit through the end of the treatment period (Week 79) 
Routine fasting SMBG and central laboratory alerts on FPG (and HbA1c at Week 26 and onward) are set up to ensur e that glycemic parameter results 
remain under predefined thresholds. 
• If one fasting SMBG value exceeds the specific glycemic limit on 
one day, the patient checks it again during the two following days. 
If all the values in three consecutive days exceed the specific limit, the patient should contact the Investigator and a central laboratory 
FPG measurement (and HbA1c at Week 26 and onward) be 
performed as soon as possible, preferably within 7 days, to 
confirm the hyperglycemia 
• Upon receipt of a central laboratory rescue alert, a central 
laboratory re-test must be completed and confirmed as exceeding 
the threshold for rescue before rescue therapy is initiated. The re-
test confirmation should be performed as soon as possible, but within 7 days of receipt, by unscheduled visit

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 7 In the event that a confirmatory FPG and/or HbA1c exceeds the threshold, 
the Investigator should ensure that no reasonable explanation exists for 
insufficient glucose control and in particular that: 
• The increased FPG has been tested at a fasting status  
(ie, no food intake for ≥8 hours) 
• Investigational medicinal produc t is given at the planned dose 
• There is no intercurrent disease,  which may jeopardize glycemic 
control (eg, infectious disease) 
• Compliance to treatment is appropriate 
• Compliance to diet and lifestyle is appropriate 
If any  of the above can reasonably explain t he insufficient glycemic control, 
the Investigator should consider not initiating rescue medication and should 
undertake appropriate action, ie: 
• Assess plasma glucose in fasting condition (ie, after at least 8 
hours fast) 
• Initiate an evaluation and treatment of intercurrent disease (to be 
reported in AE/concomitant medication parts of the e-CRF and the 
medical record) 
• Stress the absolute need to be compliant with treatment 
• Organize a specific interview with the patient and a Registered 
Dietician or other qualified nutrition  professional to reinforce the 
absolute need to be compliant with diet and lifestyle recommendations, and schedule a FPG/HbA1c assessment at the 
next visit 
If none of the above mentioned reasons can be found, or if appropriate 
action fails to decrease FPG/HbA1c under the threshold values, rescue 
medication may be introduced . 
Open-label rescue medication(s) to  treat hyperglycemia will be at the 
discretion of the Investigator and in accordance with local standard of care and prescribing practice. Except for sodium-glucose co-transporter Type 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, and additional metformin and sulfonylurea, any approved 
medication(s) including oral antidiabetic drugs, glucagon-like peptide 
1 receptor agonists, or insulin can be prescribed to treat the hyperglycemia. 
Metformin will also be permitted for patients on sulfonylurea only at 
Screening. The patient continues the study treatment (blinded) and stays in 
the study in order to collect efficacy and safety information. The planned 
visits and assessments should occur until the last scheduled visit. For 
patients with renal impairment, contrai ndications to antihyperglycemic drugs 
should be taken into consideration.

ASSESSMENT SCHEDULE See Study Flowchart, Section  1.2. 
STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
 Sample size determination: 
The sample size/power calculation  is based on the primary variable, change 
from Baseline to Week 26 in HbA1c. 
Assuming a common standard deviation (SD) of 1.2% and using a 2-sided 
test at a 0.05 α-level, 250 patients per arm will have at least 99% power to 
detect a treatment difference of 0.6% in mean HbA1c change from Baseline to Week 26 between sotagliflozin 400 mg and placebo. 
The number of patients taking a sulf onylurea and metformin will be limited to 
330 patients, to ensure sufficient numbers of sulfonylurea monotherapy 
patients. 
Analysis population: 
Efficacy analyses will be based on the
 intention-to-treat (ITT) population, 
defined as all randomized patients, irres pective of compliance with the study 
protocol and procedures.

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 9 Primary analysis: 
Analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint (change from Baseline to Week 26 
in HbA1c) will be performed on the ITT population, using HbA1c 
measurements obtained during the study , including those obtained after IMP 
discontinuation or introduction of rescue therapy. 
The primary efficacy endpoint of change in HbA1c from  Baseline to Week 
26 will be analyzed with missing values imputed by control-based multiple 
imputation method under the missing not at random framework.  
• For placebo patients, missing data will be imputed based on the 
placebo group data 
• For patients in the sotagliflozin group, missing data will be imputed 
as if the patients were on placebo throughout the study, where all 
patients’ measurements including  the on-treatment measurements 
will be considered as if the measurements were from the placebo in the imputation model 
Each of the complete datasets will be analyzed by
 an Analysis of 
Covariance (ANCOVA) model with treatment groups (sotagliflozin, placebo), 
randomization stratum of HbA1c ( ≤8.5%, >8.5%), randomization stratum of 
metformin use at Screening (Yes, No), randomization stratum of 
SBP (<130, ≥ 130 mmHg), and country as fixed effects, and Baseline HbA1c 
value as a covariate. Results from each complete dataset will be combined to provide the adjusted mean change in HbA1c from Baseline to Week 26 
for each treatment group, as well as the between-group difference 
(comparing sotagliflozin versus placebo) and the 95% confidence interval 
(CI) for the difference.  
Summary statistics (for screening value, Baseline value, observed values, 
and observed changes from Baseline) at scheduled visits will be provided 
for each treatment group. The summary will include the number of 
observations, mean, SD, standard error (SE), minimum, median, and 
maximum. Graphical presentations will also be used to examine trends over time using mean values (±SE) and mean changes from Baseline (±SE) at 
each of the scheduled visits (using observed cases [OC]). 
Analysis of secondary efficacy endpoints: The secondary endpoints will be analyzed using a similar approach to the 
primary efficacy endpoint, with missing values imputed by control-based 
multiple imputation method under the missing not at random framework.  
For each of the continuous secondary endpoints, each of the complete 
datasets will be analyzed by the ANCOVA model with treatment groups (sotagliflozin, placebo), randomization stratum of HbA1c ( ≤8.5%, >8.5%), 
randomization stratum of metformin use at Screening (Yes, No), randomization stratum of SBP (<130 mmHg, ≥130 mmHg), and country as 
fixed effects, and Baseline secondary endpoint value as a covariate. For the 
analysis of SBP in patients with Baseline SBP ≥130 mmHg, the 
randomization stratum of SBP will not be included in the ANCOVA model. Results from each complete dataset will be combined to provide the 
adjusted mean change from Baseline to Week 26 for each treatment group, 
as well as the between-group differenc e (comparing sotagliflozin versus 
placebo) and the 95% CI for the difference.  
The categorical secondary efficacy variables of HbA1c <6.5%, <7% at Week 
26 will be analyzed using a Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel method stratified by randomization stratum of HbA1c ( ≤8.5%, >8.5%), randomization stratum of 
metformin use at Screening (Yes, No), and randomization stratum of SBP (<130, ≥130 mmHg).

The analysis of other endpoints will be descriptive with no formal testing. 
Summary statistics at scheduled visits using observed cases will be 
provided by each treatment group. Graphi cal presentations will also be used 
to illustrate trends over time. 
Analyses of safety data  
All safety summaries will be descriptive; no statistical significance tests will 
be performed on safety data. These analyses will be based on the Safety 
Population, which is defined as all r andomized patients who receive at least 
1 dose of double-blind treatment, regar dless of the amount of treatment 
administered. Patients will be analyzed for safety analyses according to the treatment actually received. The safety analyses will be provided for the 
26-week Core Treatment Period and for the entire treatment period.  
DURATION OF STUDY PERIOD (per 
patient)  Up to 85 weeks, including a Screening Period consisting of a Screening phase of up to 2 weeks and a 2-week single-blind Run-in phase, a 26-week 
double blind Core Treatment Period, a 53 week double blind Extension 
Period, a 2-week post treatment Follow-up period to collect safety information.

a If a patient discontinues treatment with investigational medicinal product (IMP) early during the 26-Week Core Treatment Period , the patient w ill have a Prematur e End-of-Treatment (EOT) Visit and a Follow-up 
Visit 2 weeks after the last dose of IMP. In addition, every effort will be made to have all patients return to the site at the  time corresponding to their scheduled visits, particularly the Week 26 Visit and Week 79 
Visit. If the patient does not agree to a site visit, they will be contacted by te lephone to inquire about safety status. If a patient disconti nues (or completes) treatment and study at the same time, a single visit will be 
performed using the procedure normally planned for the EOT visit. 
b If a patient completes the Core Treatment, but discontinues IMP during th e Extension Period, the pa tient will have a Premature EOT Visit, and a Follow-up Visit 2 weeks after t he last dose of IMP. Every effort will 
be made to have all patients return to the site at the time corresponding to their quarterly visits (ie, every 13 weeks) during  the Extension Period, particularly the Week 79 Visit. If the patient does not agree to a site 
visit, at the time corresponding to  their Week 79 Visit, all attempts will be made to contact the patient to inquire about safe ty status. If a patient discontinues (or completes) treatment and study at the same time, a 
single visit will be performed using the procedure normally planned for the EOT visit. 
c At Visits 4 (Week 1), 6 (W eek 8) and 14 (2 weeks after the last dose of IM P) patients will be contact ed by telephone, and not s een on-site.  
d Height to be measured only at screening. 
e Vital sign measurements (sitting BP and heart rate): 3 separate seated BP and heart rate measurements should be taken with at l east 1 minute between readings, following a 5-minute rest period and prior to 
phlebotomy (see  Section  9.2.1.4 and detailed instructions in Appendix C ). 
f The abbreviated physical exam s hould focus on cardiac and respiratory systems, as well as any areas important for assessment of  adverse events if necessary. 
g See Section  9.2.1.6  for details of SMBG measurements. Glucose meters used for SMBG display results as plasma glucose concentration. Patients shoul d measure their fasting plasma glucose at least 3 times per 
week (including on day of each on-site study visit). After Visit 9 (Week 26), if fasting SMBG values are <120 mg/dL, over a 2-w eek period, the Investigator can instruct patients to self-monitor blood glucose once a 
week (on day of on-site study visit for weeks with on-site study visits). 
h The 12-lead elec trocardiogram (ECG) recordi ngs should be obtained prior to IMP adminis tration. The ECG w ill be evaluated as “no rmal” or “abnormal”. 
i All laboratory assessments occur prior to IMP administration on the day of the visit.

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 15 k Serum pregnancy testing only at screening; urine pregnancy testing subsequently. Serum pregnancy test results must be reviewed prior to the Run-In phase for all women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) 
unless there is documented history of menopa use (based on documented follicle-stimula ting hormone [FSH] and estradiol levels – if results not documented then FSH and estr adiol will be tested at  Screening visit) 
or they are surgically sterile. Any positive urine test results must be confirmed based on serum pregnancy test. The Investigator may perform additional tests at their discretion or as required by local regulations. 
l Pre-dose plasma concentration samples (ie, of sotagliflozin and so tagliflozin-3-O-glucuronide) should be drawn with the other l aboratory assessments at Week 4, Week 18, Week, 26, Week 52, and Week 79. 
Post-dose plasma concentration samples should be drawn 1 hour 30 minutes after sotagliflozin administration at Week 26 and Week  79. The date and time of the last intake of study drug prior to visits where 
pharmacokinetic (PK) samples are taken should be recorded by the patient in the patient diary. Patients should be reminded of t his at visits preceding PK time points to ensure these details are captured. In the 
case of premature IMP discontinuation, PK samples should not be drawn at the premature EOT visit, nor at any subsequent visits. 
m Urinalysis performed by the central laboratory includes urine dipstick and microscopy. Dipstick includes assessment of specific  gravity, pH, protein, blood, ketones, b ilirubin, urobilinogen, nitrite, and leukocyte 
esterase. Microscopy includes detection of formed cellular elements, casts, bacteria, yeast, parasites, and crystals in centrif uged urine sediment. In the event of abnormal urinalysis findings suspicious of urinary 
tract infection, urine culture should be performed. Positive urine culture determination will be based upon the criteria of the  reporting laboratory.  
 
p All serious adverse events (SAEs), adverse ev ents (AEs), AEs of special interest (AESI s), and Events of Special Interest (EOSIs) will be collected starting with signing in formed consent and continue until the end 
of the study. All AEs that occur during treatment should be followed until study completion (or until patients leave the study)  or until the event has resolv ed, the condition has stabilized, or the patient is lost to 
follow-up. All patients will have a follow-up visit 2 weeks after the last dose of IMP to collect safety information.

4.1 BACKGROUND: SOTAGLIFLOZIN AND DISEASE 
Sotagliflozin is a dual inhibitor of the sodium-g lucose cotransporters type 1 and 2 (SGLT1 and 
SGLT2) being developed for use in type 2 diabetes  (T2D), a metabolic disorder characterized by 
hyperglycemia that results from a combination of increased insulin resistance and beta cell 
dysfunction. The microvascular complications of diabetes are well known and can result in 
impaired renal function, retinopath y and neuropathy. Other comorbidities that are frequently 
associated with diabetes are hy pertension, obesity, and cardiovascul ar (CV) disease. Recently, the 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released a report stating that if current trends continue, 1 in 3 Americans will have diabetes by the year 2050. According to the most recent 
International Diabetes Federation Diabetes Atlas, the estimates in 2015 were that 1 in 11 adults 
have diabetes, which means 415 million people;  estimated to rise to 642 million by 2040 ( 1). 
According to the World Health Organization, th ere are about 60 million people with diabetes in 
the European Region, or about 10.3% of men a nd 9.6% of women aged 25 years and over ( 2). 
While these numbers include both people with T2 D and type 1 diabetes (T1D), over 90% of 
adults with diabetes have T2D. Diabetes is among the leading causes of death by disease and is a leading cause of heart disease, stroke, blindness, kidney disease, and amputation ( 1, 2). 
Despite the fact that the population of people with  diabetes is growing, none of the current 
therapies is curative and the results of treatment are variable. 
Although lifestyle changes, including diet, exer cise, and education, are valuable components of 
diabetes treatment, the vast majority of peopl e with T2D require pharmacological therapy to 
control the disease. In the United States (US) and Europe, metformin is the standard first-line 
therapy in the absence of any contraindications or tolerability issues, as per guidance from the 
American Diabetes Association (ADA; 3).  
Despite the numerous treatment options available, monotherapy fails in many patients as beta-cell 
function continues to deteriorate leading to pr ogressively increasing hyperglycemia. Aggressive 
glycemic control with the currently available agents often leads to side effects, most notably weight gain and an increased fr equency of hypoglycemia. These concerns emphasize the need to 
develop new agents that effectively and safe ly lower glucose in patients with diabetes. 
In patients with diabetes, it is desirable to ma intain blood glucose in the normal range without 
exhausting the ability of the pancreatic beta-cells to produce insulin. Glucose is transported across the cell membrane by 2 different types of glucose transporters: glucose-faci litated transporters and 
SGLT proteins ( 4). In the kidney, after blood is filtered by the glomerulus, glucose passes into the 
urine, but 99% is reabsorbed, primarily via SG LT2, which is responsible for 90% of glucose 
reabsorption, while 10% is reabsorbed by SGLT1.  When functional SGLT2 is lacking in humans, 
a significant amount of glucose remains in  the urine and is removed from the body ( 5). This way 
of reducing blood glucose is not an insulin-dep endent mechanism and therefore hyperglycemia 
may be reduced while the pancreas is spared fr om an increased demand for insulin production that

EFC14835 - sotagliflozin Version number: 1 
Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 26 is caused by hyperglycemia. Since obesity is a significant comorbidity in T2D, and insulin 
resistance is increased in obesity, the caloric loss from glucose in the urine may represent an additional benefit resulting in decreased weight, which should result in decreased insulin 
resistance ( 5).  
The SGLT1 is expressed predominantly in the gast rointestinal (GI) tract; SGLT1 is responsible 
for the majority of glucose absorption by the small intestine ( 6). Inhibition of SGLT1 in the GI 
tract prevents glucose from being absorbed. Additionally, there is accumulating evidence that SGLT1 inhibition stimulates secretion of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and peptide YY (PYY),  gut hormones involved in pancreatic beta-cell function and appetite control, respectively. 
Reduced glucose absorption in the proximal intestine leads to more glucose being delivered distally, which allows L cells in both the ileum and the colon to sense glucose and its byproducts, 
and as a result, they secrete GLP-1 and PYY. A lthough a complete lack of functional SGLT1 may 
be associated with symptoms of glucose and galactose malabsorption ( 7), pharmacologic 
inhibition of SGLT1 by sotagliflozin has not produced these effects in preclinical models or 
patients with T2D. Selective inhibitors of th e SGLT1 transporter are in early stages of 
development. 
Extensive clinical studies conducte d for selective SGLT2 inhibitors have established this class as 
effective agents for the treatment of T2D (3, 8) and have led to approvals by the US Food and 
Drug Administration (FDA) and the European  Medicines Agency (EMA). Studies with 
sotagliflozin, a potent, dual inhibitor of SGLT2 and SGLT1, have shown that this agent produces 
significant glucosuria in preclinical animal m odels, healthy human volunt eers, and patients with 
T2D. Single and multiple-dose administration of sotagliflozin to healthy human subjects has resulted in dose-dependent increases in glucosuria. Multiple-dose (28-day) administration in patients with diabetes produced improvements in several metabolic parame ters, including urinary 
glucose excretion (UGE), fasting plasma gluc ose (FPG), hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), GLP-1, and 
PYY. These data suggest that sotagliflozin should be  of therapeutic benefit to patients with T2D.  
4.2 CLINICAL TRIALS OF SOTAGLIFLOZIN IN HUMANS 
Approximately 780 subjects (639 assigned to so tagliflozin and 141 assigned to placebo) have 
participated in completed clinical studies of sotagliflozin. No significant safety concerns have 
been identified in the sotagliflozin drug program, and sotagliflozin has been well-tolerated in all 
studies to date. Serious adverse events (SAEs) and discontinuations due to adverse events (AEs) 
have been infrequent and have been balanced between treatment and co mparator groups. Reports 
of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAE) across all sotagliflozin studies for which data are available were generally balanced between treatme nt and comparator groups. The most frequently 
reported TEAEs ( ≥2.0%) were headache, nausea, diarrhea, constipation, and dizziness, all of 
which were reported at a frequency greater than placebo. However, the majority were described as 
mild to moderate, and most resolved spontaneously.  
In completed and ongoing clinical trials, no safety issues in addition to those already described in 
the current Investigator’s Brochure (IB) were observed. In general, no significant imbalances of 
SAE/AEs between sotagliflozin and comparat ors were observed in completed studies. 
Cumulatively, during the clinical trial program 8 SAEs were reported by 6 patients (4 T2D and 
(electronic

EFC14835 - sotagliflozin Version number: 1 
Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 27 2 T1D), all of which were assessed as unrelated to study dr ug; those reported by 4 T2D patients 
who received sotagliflozin included pulmonary em bolism, deep vein thrombosis, bile duct stone, 
cholangitis and lower limb fracture, while a myocardial infarction (MI) was experienced by a 
patient receiving placebo. Two SAEs of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) were reported by 2 T1D 
patients receiving 400 mg once daily sotagliflozin in the Phase 2 T1D study 
LX4211.1-203-TIDM; both SAEs were assessed as due  to failure of insulin delivery via insulin 
pump.  
Inhibition of SGLT2 and SGLT1 is expected to  improve glycemic control, but may also 
potentially increase the risk of hypoglycemia when given with insulin or insulin secretagogues 
like sulfonylurea. Other medicines in the SGLT2 cl ass have had a low incidence of hypoglycemia 
in general, but when used in combination with insulin or insulin secretagogues, an increase in hypoglycemia has been observed. 
A drug interaction study with digoxin, a sensitive P-glycoprotein (P-gp) substrate, indicated that 
sotagliflozin acts as a weak P-gp inhibitor. T hus, sotagliflozin increases systemic exposure of 
digoxin and other substrates of P-gp ( 9). 
More information on the safety of sotagliflozin and on the clinical program can be found in the 
IB. 
4.3 RATIONALE FOR SELECTION OF DOSE 
The proposed sotagliflozin 400 mg once-daily dose is based on the results of the Phase 2b study 
LX4211.1-202-DM. In this study, sotagliflozin doses of 75 mg once daily, 200 mg once daily, 
200 mg twice daily, and 400 mg once daily sotagl iflozin were tested ove r a 12-week, double-blind 
period. The sotagliflozin 400 mg once daily dose wa s chosen for further evaluation based on its 
HbA1c lowering effect and the ove rall safety and tolerability observed at this dose. At 12 weeks, 
the sotagliflozin 400 mg dose lowered HbA1c by a mean of 0.93%, while placebo lowered HbA1c 
by a mean of 0.14%. Lower sotagliflozin doses were less effective than the 400 mg dose and did not have any advantages in safety or tolerability. The overall incidence of AEs on sotagliflozin 400 mg once daily was similar to that seen with placebo.  
From a safety perspective, sotagliflozin was well-tolerated across studies. In healthy subjects 
sotagliflozin was well-tolerated following single doses up to  2000 mg, and in multiple doses up to 
800 mg over 10 days. Furthermore, in a thorough QT study, single doses of sotagliflozin (800 mg and 2000 mg) were well to lerated and did not prolong th e QT interval. Additionally, 
evaluation of metabolites in urine and plasma of healthy subjects resulted in no safety concerns following single doses of sotagliflozin 400 mg. In patients with T2D, single doses of sotagliflozin 400 mg in combination with sitagliptin, and multiple doses up to sotagliflozin 400 mg in 
combination with metformin over 12 weeks were also well-tolerated.  
4.4 RATIONALE FOR STUDY DESIGN AND CONTROL GROUPS 
This study is designed to demonstrate the efficacy  and safety of sotagliflozin when used as add-on 
therapy to a sulfonylurea (alone or in combination with metformin) in patients with T2D who

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 28 have inadequate glycemic control. Sotagliflozin pl us a sulfonylurea (alone or in combination with 
metformin) will be compared to placebo plus a sulfonylurea (alone or in combination with 
metformin). Based on the study design, the protocol stipulat es that patients be provided 
antidiabetic agent rescue therapy according to a predefined algorithm. Safety, tolerability, 
pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) effects of sotagliflozin are supported by 
Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies and animal toxicology data in rats up to 26 weeks and dogs up to 
39 weeks as well as 2 year carcinogenicity data in rats.  
To achieve balanced randomization for assessmen t of the primary endpoint , randomization will be 
stratified based on preexisting metabolic control (Screening HbA1c ≤8.5% versus >8.5%) as well 
as metformin use at Screening (Yes, No). Another stratification factor (systolic blood pressure 
[SBP] <130 mmHg versus ≥ 130 mmHg) has been added to ensure  balance in randomization for a 
secondary endpoint (change from Baseline to Week 12 in SBP for patients with Baseline 
SBP ≥130 mmHg).  
A placebo control will be used to allow for an unbi ased assessment of treatment effects and safety 
data. Bias will be minimized by randomizing the patients to treatment groups, blinding the 
patients, the Investigators, the Sponsor, and the service provider to the treatment allocations, and 
by adjudicating the endpoints in a blinded fashion. 
The number of patients taking a sulfonylurea and metformin w ill be limited to 330 patients, to 
ensure sufficient numbers of sulfonylurea monotherapy patients. A parallel-group, randomized placebo c ontrolled design was selected be cause trial participants are 
exposed to a single treatment and assignment to that treatment is based solely on chance. This 
design is free of the limitations of competing designs such as crossover in which there may be a carryover of effect from one treatment to the se cond treatment. Although this carryover effect can 
be minimized with a washout period, it is possible that some longer term effects may persist. 
While the sample size of the pa rallel group design is larger to account for more variability when 
participants cannot serve as their own control,  the above mentioned limita tions of the crossover 
design have led the randomized controlled trial design to be the standard for therapeutic 
confirmatory trials for regulatory approval such as this trial. 
4.5 BENEFIT/RISK OF SOTAGLIFLOZIN 
Sotagliflozin is currently being investigated as  an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve 
glycemic control in adults with T2D. The development program will also provide efficacy and safety data for sotagliflozin in combination with other antidiabetic medications. In addition the program will evaluate clinical outcomes in patients with high CV risk and in patients with renal impairment. The use of sotagliflozin in the treatme nt of T1D is also being studied in a separate 
development program. 
Sotagliflozin may benefit a wide variety of patients with diabetes based on multiple potential 
beneficial effects of dual SGLT2/SGLT1 inhi bition, and its insulin-independent mechanism of 
action. Improvements in HbA1c, FPG, and postp randial glucose (PPG) were observed with 
sotagliflozin in multiple studies. As anticipated  from the mechanism of action, treatment with

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 29 sotagliflozin resulted in increased UGE (from inhibition of SGLT2) as well as increased incretin 
levels (from inhibition of SGLT1). In addition, the improvements in body weight, blood pressure 
(BP), and triglycerides (TG) observed with sotag liflozin treatment have the potential to benefit 
patients with diabetes through their effects on common diabetic comorbidities.  
Phase 2 data indicated that sotagliflozin may reduce SBP by 10 to 15 mmHg in patients with SBP 
≥130 mmHg at Baseline, while having little effect in patients with SBP <130 mmHg, and did not 
induce hypotension. Since this could be of benefit to patients with T2D, this finding is being 
followed up as a secondary objective in this trial. 
Overall, sotagliflozin has been well-tolerated in all studies to date, with the majority of events 
assessed as mild to moderate; mo st of which resolved spontane ously. SAEs and discontinuations 
due to AEs have been limited and balanced between treatme nt and comparator groups.  
Events of special interest (EOSI) are evaluated based on either their potential link to the drug’s 
mechanism of action, events that occur in other SGLT-inhibitor drugs, or regulatory interest/guidance for diabetes products, but found not  to be in imbalance in clinical trials. In 
addition to the identified and potential risks (genital mycotic infections [male and female], metabolic acidosis, DKA, urinary tr act infections, volume depletion, severe hypoglycemia) for the 
sotagliflozin program, other EOSI have been de fined. These EOSI are: major adverse cardiac 
events (MACE) and other CV events, venous th rombotic events, diarrhea, pancreatitis, bone 
fractures, renal events, malignancies of special interest (including but not limited to: breast, bladder, renal cell, Leydig cell,  pancreatic, prostate, and thyroi d cancer), and AEs leading to 
amputation. 
The improvement in glycemic control, the reductions in weight and BP, and the tolerability and 
safety profile of sotagliflozi n to date, demonstrate a favorab le benefit-risk assessment for 
sotagliflozin.

6.1 DESCRIPTION OF THE STUDY 
This study is a Phase 3, multicenter and multinational, 1:1 randomized, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled, parallel group study that is an ticipated to enroll appr oximately 500 patients. 
The study will comprise a Screening Period consisting of a Screening phase of up to 2 weeks and 
a 2-week single blind Run-in phase, a double- blind Core Treatment Period, a double-blind 
Extension Period, and a Follow-up Period. 
The study design is presented graphically at the end of the synopsis. 
6.1.1 Screening Period 
6.1.1.1 Screening phase (Visit 1) 
The Screening phase will last up to 2 weeks. The Screening phase must be long enough to collect 
the data required to establish whether the patie nt satisfies the inclus ion/exclusion criteria. 
Patients taking a sulfonylurea ( ≥half the maximum recommended dose as per local label or 
maximum tolerated dose [documented]) as monotherapy or in combin ation with metformin 
(≥1500 mg per day or maximum tolerated dose [documented]) each at a stable dose for at least 
12 weeks before enrollment will be eligible for Screening. The number of patients taking a 
sulfonylurea and metformin will be limited to 330 patients, to ensure sufficient numbers of sulfonylurea monotherapy patients. 
At the Screening Visit after signing of the informed consent form (ICF), eligibility criteria will be 
assessed and Screening assessments will be performed. Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) not willing to use effective method(s) of  birth control or who are unwilling or unable to 
be tested for pregnancy will be excluded from the study; guidance on highly effective 
contraceptive methods and collection of pregnancy information is provided in Appendix A . 
If another contraceptive method is used (such as a barrier method), it should be used in 
combination with one of the highly effective methods in Appendix A  (such as an oral 
contraceptive). 
The Interactive Response Technology (IRT; eith er Interactive Voice Response System or 
Interactive Web Response System) will be contacted  at Visit 1 for notification of screening and 
for patient number allocation. 
6.1.1.2 Run-in phase (Visit 2) 
The Run-in phase will last 2 weeks. Patients will be treated in a single-blind manner with placebo 
(2 tablets) once daily during the Run-in phase, starting from Visit 2.

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 32 6.1.2 Double-blind Core Treatment Period (Week 0 to Week 26) 
Eligible patients will be randomized on Day 1 (V isit 3). In order to qualify for randomization, 
patients must demonstrate compliance during th e single-blind placebo Run-in phase based upon 
tablet count ( ≥80%), and as assessed at the Investigator’s discretion.  
Randomization will be stratified by: 
• HbA1c at Screening (≤ 8.5%, >8.5%) 
• Metformin use at Screening (Yes, No) 
• SBP at Screening (<130 mmHg, ≥130 mmHg) 
Following randomization, patient s will be treated in a double-blind manner for 26 weeks. 
Approximately 500 patients ≥18 years of age (or ≥ legal age of majority if greater) will be 
randomly assigned 1:1 to 1 of the following 2 treatment groups: 
• Sotagliflozin 400 mg as two 200 mg tablets, once daily 
• Placebo as two placebo tablets (i dentical to sotagliflozin 200 mg tablets in appearance), 
once daily 
Fasting glucose (plasma or serum) and HbA1c (both measured at central laboratory) will be 
masked to study sites after randomization until study end. To prevent partial unblinding, the 
central laboratory urine dipstick will not include the measurement of urine glucose. 
All Visits will be on-site with the exception of Visit 4 (Week 1) and Visit 6 (Week 8), which will 
be telephone visits. 
If a patient discontinues treatme nt with investigational medicinal product (IMP) early during the 
26-week Core Treatment Period, th e patient will have a Premature End-of-Treatment (EOT) Visit 
and a Follow-up Visit 2 weeks after the last dose of IMP. In addition, every effort will be made to 
have all patients return to the s ite at the time corresponding to thei r scheduled visits, particularly 
the Week 26 Visit and Week 79 Visit. If the patient does not agree to site visits, they will be 
contacted by telephone to inquire about their safe ty status at the time of initially scheduled 
Week 79 Visit. 
6.1.3 Double-blind Extension Period (Week 27 to Week 79) 
From Week 27 to 79, patients will be in a 53-week double-blind Extens ion Period. Patients will 
continue to receive the blinded medication (sot agliflozin or placebo) to which they were 
randomized on Day 1. Patients who received rescue medication during the 26-week Core Treatment Period will continue on the same rescue medication dur ing the double-blind Extension 
Period (unless the Investigator considers a change necessary for safety reasons). 
If a patient completes the Core Treatment Period, but discon tinues IMP during the Extension 
Period, the patient will have a Premature EOT Visit and a Follow-up Visit 2 weeks after the last 
dose of IMP.

treatment early, prior to the Week 26 Visit) retu rn to the site at the time corresponding to their 
quarterly visits (ie, every 13 weeks) during the Extension Period, particularly the Week 79 Visit. 
If the patient does not agree to site visits, at the time corresponding to their Week 79 Visit, all 
attempts will be made  to contact the patients to inquire about their safety status. 
6.1.4 Follow-up period 
Following the last dose of IMP (either as sche duled or prematurely), a post-treatment follow-up 
should be scheduled for all patients 14 days (±3 days) after permanent IMP discontinuation. This 
will be a telephone visit. 
6.2 DURATION OF STUDY PARTICIPATION 
6.2.1 Duration of study participation for each patient 
The total duration of the study for each patient wi ll be 85 weeks and includes a Screening phase of 
up to 2 weeks, a 2-week single-blind Run-in pha se, a 26-week double-blind core treatment period 
followed by a 53-week double-blind treatment ex tension, and a 2-week Follow-up Period after 
completion of study treatment. 
6.2.2 Determination of end of clinical trial (all patients) 
The end of the study is defined as being the “las t patient last visit” pl anned with the protocol, 
including follow-up visit. 
The Sponsor can terminate the trial prematurel y based on the advice of the independent Data 
Monitoring Committee (DMC) or other unforeseen developments. 
6.3 INTERIM ANALYSIS 
No interim analysis is planned. 
6.4 STUDY COMMITTEES 
6.4.1 Steering Committee 
The Steering Committee (SC) is composed of experts in diabetes and scientists with clinical and 
methodological expertise. 
This Committee, led by a Chair, is responsible for producing and conductin g a scientifically sound 
study and for ensuring accurate reporting of the st udy. In that capacity, the SC must address and 
resolve scientific issues encountered during the study. The members will remain blinded until 
completion of the study.

review the recommendations from the DMC th roughout the study. The SC members will 
participate in face-to-face meetings at regula r intervals throughout the study and in regularly 
scheduled teleconferences. 
Detailed activities and responsibilities of the SC are provided in the SC charter. 
6.4.2 Data Monitoring Committee 
A DMC with members who are independent from the Sponsor and the Investigators will meet on 
a regular basis, and will be responsible for: 
• Review of accumulating clinical trial safety data by treatment 
• Making a recommendation to the Sponsor rega rding the study following each meeting 
Safety data to be reviewed will be unblinded and include even ts and outcomes described below 
for adjudication, as well as any additional safety da ta considered relevant. Details describing the 
DMC processes and procedures are outlined in a separate DMC Charter. To maintain continuous 
blinding and study integrity, the analysis will be conducted by an inde pendent statistician, and 
measures will be taken to ensure the validity of the data. 
6.4.3 Clinical Endpoint Committee(s) 
The Clinical Endpoint Committees (CEC) is/are comprised of experts in cardiology and 
nephrology (and other appropriate medical specia lties such as neurology and endocrinology, as 
needed) who are independent of the Sponsor and the contract research organization (CRO). The 
CECs will review and adjudicate all deaths, MACE/selected CV events (MI, stroke, unstable 
angina leading to hospitalization, and heart failu re leading to hospitalization), selected renal 
events, bone fracture, and DKA. 
The details regarding the CEC processes and procedures will be outlined in the CEC Charter(s).  
6.4.4 Safety adjudication of events requiring ongoing monitoring 
Two independent committees will review safety events that require ongoing monitoring to ensure

8.2 NONINVESTIGATIONAL MEDICINAL PRODUCTS 
8.2.1 Sulfonylurea and metformin 
Patients are enrolled with a background therapy consisting of a sulfonylurea alone or in 
combination with metformin. Background sulfon ylurea and metformin are considered as 
noninvestigational medi cinal products (NIMP). Sulfonylurea and metformin (commercial 
formulations) will be administered orally according to the locally approved label. 
The dose of sulfonylurea must be ≥half the maximum recommended dose as per local label or 
maximum tolerated dose (maximum tolerate dose needs to be documented). If applicable, the dose 
of metformin must be ≥1500 mg/day or maximum tolerated dose (maximum tolerate dose needs 
to be documented). Sulfonylurea and metformin doses must be stable for at least 12 weeks before 
Screening. 
The doses of sulfonylurea and, if applicable, metformin, should be stable throughout the study 
unless down-titration is required for safety reasons.

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 40 Sulfonylurea and metformin treatment are to be reported in the electronic case report form 
(e-CRF). This information should include specifi c drug name, dose, route of administration, and 
frequency. 
The cost of the background treatment sulfonylurea  or metformin not covered by health insurance 
will be reimbursed where permitted by local regulations. 
8.2.2 Rescue therapy 
The threshold values are defined as  follows, depending on study period: 
• FPG >270 mg/dL (15.0 mmol/L) from Randomization up through the scheduled Week 8 
Visit 
• FPG >240 mg/dL (13.3 mmol/L) after the Week 8 visit up through the scheduled Week 12 Visit 
• FPG >200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) after the Week 12 Visit through the end of the 26-week Core Treatment Period 
• FPG >170 mg/dL (9.4 mmol/L) or HbA1c ≥ 8.0% after the Week 26 Visit through the end 
of the treatment period (Week 79) 
Routine fasting SMBG (see Section  9.2.1.6) and central laboratory alerts on FPG (and HbA1c at 
Week 26 and onward) are set up to ensure that glycemic paramete r results remain under 
predefined thresholds.  
• If one fasting SMBG value exceeds the spec ific glycemic limit on one  day, the patient 
checks it again during the two following days. If all the values in three consecutive days 
exceed the specific limit, the patient should contact the Investigator and a central 
laboratory FPG measurement (and HbA1c at We ek 26 and onward) be performed as soon 
as possible, preferably within 7 days, to confirm the hyperglycemia 
• Upon receipt of a central laboratory rescue  alert, a central laboratory re-test must  be 
completed and confirmed as exceeding the threshold for rescue before rescue therapy is initiated. The re-test confirmati on should be performed as soon as possible, but within 
7 days of receipt, by unscheduled visit 
In the event that a confirmatory FPG and/or Hb A1c exceeds the threshold, the Investigator should 
ensure that no reasonable explanation exists for in sufficient glucose control and in particular that: 
• The increased FPG has been tested at a fasting status (ie, no food intake for ≥8 hours) 
• Investigational medici nal product is given at the planned dose 
• There is no intercurrent disease, which may jeopardize glycemic control (eg, infectious 
disease) 
• Compliance to treatment is appropriate 
• Compliance to diet and lif estyle is appropriate

EFC14835 - sotagliflozin Version number: 1 
Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 41 If any of the above can reasonably explain the in sufficient glycemic control, the Investigator 
should consider not initiating re scue medication and should unde rtake appropriate action, ie: 
• Assess plasma glucose in fasting condition (ie, after at least 8 hours fast) 
• Initiate an evaluation and treatment of intercurrent disease (to be reported in 
AE/concomitant medication parts of the e-CRF and the medical record) 
• Stress the absolute need to be compliant with treatment 
• Organize a specific interview with the patient and a Registered Dietician or other qualified nutrition professional to reinforce the absolute ne ed to be compliant with diet and lifestyle 
recommendations, and schedule a FPG/Hb A1c assessment at the next visit 
If none of the above mentioned reasons can be fo und, or if appropriate action fails to decrease 
FPG/HbA1c under the threshold values, rescue medication may be introduced. 
Open-label rescue medication(s) to treat hyperglycemia will be at the discretion of the Investigator and in accordance with local standard of care and prescribing practice. Except for 
SGLT2 inhibitors, and additional metformin a nd sulfonylurea, any approved medication(s) 
including oral antidiabetic drugs, GLP-1 receptor agonists, or insulin can be prescribed to treat the hyperglycemia. Metformin will also be permitted for patients on sulfonylurea only at Screening. The patient continues the study tr eatment (blinded) and stays in the study in order to collect 
efficacy and safety information. The planned vi sits and assessments should occur until the last 
scheduled visit. For patients with renal impairmen t, contraindications to antihyperglycemic drugs 
should be taken into  consideration.  
Rescue therapy is considered a NIMP. Rescue therapy is to be  reported in the e-CRF. This 
information should include specific drug name, dose, route of administration, and frequency. 
If not covered by health insurance, the cost of the rescue therapy will be reimbursed where permitted by local regulations. 
8.3 BLINDING PROCEDURES 
8.3.1 Methods of blinding 
To maintain blinding, sotagliflozin and placebo tablets and packaging will be blinded and 
indistinguishable. 
During the double-blind treatment period each treatment package will be labeled with a number, 
which is generated by a computer program from Sanofi. Investigators will not have access to the randomization (treatment) code excep t under circumstances described in  Section 8.3.2 . 
The randomization and the treatment allocation will be performed centrally by an IRT. The study 
biostatistician provides th e randomization scheme to the IRT. Then, the IRT generates the patient 
randomization list from which it allocates treatment arms to the patients.

EFC14835 - sotagliflozin Version number: 1 
Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 43  At Visit 3 (Baseline), assessment results are reviewed and Baseline assessments 
are compl
eted, the IRT is contacted for randomization and allocation of the treatment package(s).  
After Visit 3 (Baseline) the IRT is contacted again each time new treatment package(s) allocation 
is required by the protocol. For each randomized  patient, the IRT will allocate treatment package 
number(s) corresponding to the treatment group assi gned. Treatment packages are allocated by 
the IRT using their treatment kit number(s). 
A randomized patient is defined as  a patient who is registered a nd assigned with a treatment kit 
number from the IRT, as documented in the IRT. A patient may not be enrolled in this study more  than once (ie, enter run-in, or be randomized 
twice). In cases where original screen failure was due to reasons expected to change at rescreening 
and based upon the Investigator’s clinical judgment , the patient can be rescreened once prior to 
entering Run-in for this study. In these cases, a patient will need to sign a new ICF, be registered 
as a re-screened patient in IRT and assigned a ne w patient number in IRT (first Screening Visit is 
to be registered as screen failure in IRT), and again complete Screening Visit 
procedures/assessments. 
8.5 PACKAGING AND LABELING 
Packaging will be undertaken in accordance with the administration schedu le. The content of the 
labeling is in accordance with the local regulatory specifications and requirements. 
The appropriate number of packages will be dispensed to cover up to the next dispensing visit 
(please refer to Section  1.2). Storage conditions and use-by-end date are part of the label text. 
Treatment labels will indicate the treatment number (used for treatment allocation and reported in 
the e-CRF). 
8.6 STORAGE CONDITIONS AND SHELF LIFE 
Investigators or other authorized persons (eg, phar macists) are responsible for storing the IMP in a 
secure and safe place in accordance with local regulations, labeling specif ications, policies, and 
procedures. 
Control of IMP storage conditions, especially control of temperature and instructions for handling 
the Sanofi compound should be managed according to the rules provided by the Sponsor. 
The expiry date and storage conditions are writte n on the IMP labels. The IMP should be stored 
between +15°C and + 30°C (59°F and 86°F).

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 44 8.7 RESPONSIBILITIES 
The Investigator, the hospital pharmacist, or othe r personnel allowed to store and dispense the 
IMP will be responsible for ensuring that the IMP us ed in the clinical trial is securely maintained 
as specified by the Sponsor and in accordan ce with applicable regulatory requirements. 
All IMPs will be dispensed in accordance with the Investigator's prescription and it is the 
Investigator's responsibility to ensure that an accurate record of IMP issued and returned is maintained. 
Any quality issue noticed with the receipt or us e of an IMP (deficiency in condition, appearance, 
pertaining documentation, labeling,  expiration date, etc) should be promptly notified to the 
Sponsor or Delegate. Some deficiencies may be recorded through a complaint procedure. 
A potential defect in the quality of IMP may be subject to initiation of a recall procedure by the 
Sponsor. In this case, the Investigator will be responsible for promptly addressing any request 
made by the Sponsor or Delega te, in order to recall the IMP and eliminate potential hazards. 
Under no circumstances will the Investigator supply IMP to a third party (except for direct-to-patient shipment, for which a courier co mpany has been approved by the Sponsor), allow 
the IMP to be used other than as directed by this  clinical trial protocol, or dispose of IMP in any 
other manner. 
8.7.1 Treatment accountability and compliance 
Accounting and compliance for IMPs will be performed at Visit 3 and all subsequent on-treatment, on-site visits.  
The Investigator will check the compliance to the IMP dose schedule based on the patient diary 
and will then complete the appropriate Site treatment and patient treatment log forms. Returned IMP will be counted by site sta ff. In addition the dosing information will be recorded on the 
appropriate pages of the e-CRF. 
For NIMPs sulfonylurea and (if applicable) metformin, name, start and end date of treatment, total 
daily dose, etc, will be documented in the source documents. Compliance to sulfonylurea and metformin will be checked by interviewing the patient and reviewing the patient diary at each visit and documented in the source documents and in the e-CRF. 
Rescue therapy (see Section  8.2.2) is to be reported in the e-CRF. This information should include 
specific drug name, dose, route of administration, and frequency. 
If compliance is inadequate as determined by the Principal Investigator (PI), patients will be 
trained again and mentored. If suboptimal compliance continues af ter training and mentoring, 
patients may be discontinued at th e discretion of the PI after discussion with the Sponsor/CRO’s 
medical monitor.

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 45 8.7.2 Return and/or destruction of treatments 
Patients are to return all IMP (unused, in use or empty bottle[s]) at each on-site visit (or final 
assessment on-treatment visit in case of permanen t premature discontinuati on), as described in 
Section  1.2.  
All used, partially-used or unused IMPs will be retrieved by the Sponsor or Dele gate. A detailed 
site and patient treatment log of the returned IMP will be established with the Investigator (or the pharmacist) and countersigned by the I nvestigator and the monitoring team. 
For NIMP not provided by the Sponsor (ie, sulfon ylurea, metformin, and rescue therapy), tracking 
is to be undertaken by the Investigator (or pha rmacist if appropriate) according to the system 
proposed by the Sponsor/CRO. 
8.8 CONCOMITANT MEDICATION 
A concomitant medication is any treatment received by the patient concomitantly to any IMP. The IMP includes placebo and sotagliflozin 400 mg. 
All concomitant medications shoul d be documented on the Medicati ons page of the e-CRF. This 
includes all NIMP treatments that are taken by the patients at any time during the clinical trial, 
beginning at Visit 1.  
Additionally, all medications ta ken in the 3 months prior to Visit 1 and prior use of SGLT2 
inhibitors should be reported. 
8.8.1 Prohibited prior and concomitant medications 
During the study treatment period, the following medications are prohibited: 
• Initiation of any antidiabetic agents, including oral or injectable antihyperglycemic agents 
other than the IMP before the rescue therapy 
Note: short-term use (<10 consecutive days) of the prohibited medication, eg, short-acting 
insulin for treatment of acute illness or surgery is allowed. 
• Systemic use of glucocorticoids for more than 10 consecutive days (topical, ophthalmic, 
nasal spray or inhaled ap plications are allowed) 
• Initiation of any weight loss drugs (eg, phentermine, orlistat) 
• Investigational medici nal products in any other clinical study 
SGLT2 inhibitors (eg, canagliflozin, dapagliflozi n, or empagliflozin), additional sulfonylurea and 
metformin are not allowed for rescue or post IMP therapy until the end of study. 
Reduction of digoxin dose should be considered because sotagliflozin acts as a weak P-gp 
inhibitor and increases systemic exposure to digoxin. Patients taking sotagliflozin with 
concomitant digoxin should have digoxin concentrations monitore d and doses reduced as needed.

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 46 In addition, other P-gp substrates may be affected and the labels of P-gp substrate drugs should be 
consulted with regards to monitoring and dose adjustments. 
Other medications which are unlikely to interfer e with the PK or PD of the IMP or confound 
interpretation of the study endpoints are allowe d as needed following discussion between the 
Investigator and the Sponsor/CRO. However, doses  of chronically administered medicines should 
be kept fixed during the trial if at all possible. After premature permanent discontinuation of the IMP, any treatments (other than SGLT2 
inhibitors, and additional sulfonylurea and metfor min) are permitted, as deemed necessary by the 
Investigator. The dose of all antihypertensive agents should be  kept constant during the 12 weeks following 
randomization and no antihypertensive agents s hould be added or withdrawn for the 12 weeks 
following randomization unless it is consid ered necessary for safety reasons. 
8.8.2 Concomitant diabetes therapy 
For patients in both groups, background sulfonyl urea and (if applicable) metformin should be 
stable throughout the study unless down-titr ation is required for safety reasons. 
The rescue medication(s) that will be used to treat hyperglycemia when a patient’s hyperglycemia 
reaches the rescue threshold are also defined as  NIMPs. Except for SGLT2 inhibitors, additional 
metformin and sulfonylurea, any approved medication(s) includi ng oral antidiabetic drugs, 
GLP-1 receptor agonists, or insulin can be prescrib ed at the Investigator’s discretion to treat the 
hyperglycemia. Metformin will also be permitted for patients on sulfonylurea only at Screening. The regimen of the rescue medications will be in  accordance with local standard of care and 
prescribing practice. 
8.9 POSTSTUDY TREATMENT 
Because sotagliflozin may reduce BP, adjustment of antihypertensive medication may be needed 
during the study in patients with hypertension. Co nversely, monitoring for an increase in BP 
should be performed after withdrawal of study medi cation. If the BP is elevated after withdrawal 
of study treatment, the Investigator should cons ider adding or adjusting antihypertensive 
medication.

For the eligibility and efficacy assessments of the study, HbA1c is measured by a certified level I “National Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program” central laboratory to allow estimation of 
the change from Baseline to Week 26 in HbA1c and the proportion of patients with HbA1c <6.5%, <7.0% at Week 26. 
If a patient needs to receive rescue antidia betic medication, assessmen t of HbA1c should be 
performed before the introducti on of the rescue medication. 
9.1.4.2 Fasting plasma glucose measurement 
Plasma glucose is measured in the fasting state at Screening (Visit 1) and all on-site visits during 
the treatment period. For the eligibility and efficacy assessments of the study, FPG is measured at 
a central laboratory to allow estimation of change from Baseline to Week 26 in FPG. 
9.1.4.3 Body weight measurement 
Body weight is measured at all on-site Visits. Body weight will be measured to allow the estimation of change from Baseline to Week 26 in body weight and reduction in body weight by ≥2%, ≥ 5%, and ≥10% from Baseline. 
Body weight should be obtained with the patient wearing undergarments or very light clothing and no shoes, and with an empty bladder. The sa me scale should be used throughout the study, 
and calibrated on a regular basis as recommended  by the manufacturer. Calibration documents 
should be filed in the study file. 
The use of balance scales is recommended. The floor surface on which the scale rests must be 
hard and should not be carpeted or covered with other soft material. The scale should be balanced 
with both weights at zero and the balance bar ali gned. The patient should stand in the center of the 
platform as standing off-center may affect measurement. The weights are moved until the beam 
balances (the arrows are aligned). The weight is  read and recorded in the e-CRF and Source Data. 
Self-reported weights are not acceptable; patients must not read the scales themselves. 
9.1.4.4 Blood pressure endpoint measurements 
Systolic BP and DBP will be asse ssed at all on-site visits. Blood pr essure measurements must be 
taken as described in Section  9.2.1.4 with details provided in Appendix C .

Serum creatinine will be assessed at Baseline (Visit 3) and selected on-site visits (see Study 
Flowchart in Section  1.2). A central laboratory will analyze samples and estimate change from 
Baseline in serum creatinine and eGFR. 
9.1.4.6 Proportion of patients requiring rescue for hyperglycemia 
The use of rescue medications for hyperglycemia  will be assessed and re ported throughout the 
treatment period. Routine alerts on FPG and/or HbA1c will be sent  to the Investigator from the 
central laboratory to ensure that glycemic parameter results remain within predefined thresholds. For details and further actions should FPG and/or  HbA1c values fall above thresholds, refer to 
Section  8.2.2. 
9.2 SAFETY ENDPOINTS 
Assessments for safety include AEs, SMBG, clinical laboratory assessments, physical 
examination, electrocardiogram (E CG), weight, and vital signs. An independent DMC will meet 
on a regular basis to review accumulating clinical trial safety data. 
Adjudication of all deaths, MACE/other selected CV  events (MI, stroke, unstable angina leading 
to hospitalization, and heart failure leading to  hospitalization), selected renal events, bone 
fracture, and DKA will be performed in a blinde d manner by a CEC(s) comprised of experts. 
Details will be provided in the charter of the CEC(s). Further details are available in Section  6.4. 
Two expert committees will review all potential cases of DILIs and cases of amputation in a 
treatment-blinded manner to evaluate causality. 
The following safety endpoints will be assessed: 
• Adverse events, AEs leading to discontinuation from the IMP, adverse events of special 
interest (AESIs), events of special interest (EOSIs), SAEs and deaths 
• Hypoglycemia (all, severe, and/or documented symptomatic hypoglycemia) 
• Clinical laboratory results (including fasting lipids; see Section  9.2.1.3) 
• Vital signs and ECG results. 
Observation period of safety endpoints  
The observation period of safety data will be divided into 3 segments: 
• The pre-treatment period is defined as the time between the date of the informed consent 
and the first dose of double-blind IMP 
• The on-treatment period (TEAE period) is defined as the time from the first dose of double-blind IMP up to 10 days (1 day for hypoglycemia) after the last dose of 
double-blind IMP, regardless of the introduction of  rescue therapy. The 10-day interval is

sotagliflozin in patients with moderate renal dysfunction) 
• The post-treatment period is defined as the time starting 11 days after the last dose of 
double-blind IMP (after the on-treatment period) 
The Baseline value for safety endpoints in the safe ty population is the last available value (or the 
average of all values for creatinine or eGFR) prio r to the first administration of double-blind IMP. 
9.2.1 Assessment methods of safety endpoints 
9.2.1.1 Adverse events 
Adverse events including SAEs, AESIs, and EOSIs will be assessed. Refer to Section  10.4 to 
Section  10.7 for details. 
9.2.1.1.1 Adverse events of special interest 
Adverse events of special interest are listed in Section  10.4.1.3, reporting requirements for AESI 
are presented in Section  10.4.4. 
9.2.1.1.2 Events of special interest 
Events of special interest are separate from AESIs.  For a list of events defined as EOSIs and their 
reporting requirements see Section  10.4.1.4 and Section  10.4.5, respectively. 
9.2.1.2 Hypoglycemia 
Hypoglycemia will be assessed from the signing of the ICF until 2 weeks after the last dose of 
IMP (note: for patients who disc ontinue treatment before Week 79, safety data will be collected 
until scheduled study end). Patients will also complete the hypoglycemia specific page (as part of 
the patient diary) from Visit 1 onwards, which will be regularly reviewed by Investigators. See Section  10.6.1 for further details. 
9.2.1.3 Laboratory safety variables 
The clinical laboratory data consist of blood analysis (including hematology , clinical chemistry, 
amylase, lipase, lipid profile) and urinalysis, according to the schedule presented in Section  1.2. 
Clinical laboratory values will be analyzed after conversion into standard international units. International units will be used in all listings and tables. Table 2  lists the hematology, clinical 
chemistry, and other blood safe ty parameters to be assesse d by the central laboratory. 
In addition, for WOCBP a serum pregnancy test is  performed at Screening, and urine pregnancy 
tests are taken at all on-site visits during the double-blind treatment period excluding Visit 4 
(Week 1). Any positive urine test results must be confirmed by a serum pregnancy test. The Investigator may perform additional tests at thei r discretion or as required by local regulations. 
Serum follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and estradiol will be  measured in menopausal women 
at Screening (Visit 1, Week -4) (see Appendix A  for definition of menopausal women).

9.2.1.3.1 Urinalysis 
Urinalysis (urine dipstick with microscopy) will be performed by central laboratory at Screening 
(Visit 1), Baseline (Visit 3), Week 26 (Visit 9) , and Week 79 (Visit 13). To prevent partial 
unblinding, the central laboratory urinalysis dipstick will not include the measurement of urine glucose. Central urinalysis includes: 
• Urine dipstick includes: specific gravit y, pH, protein, blood, ketones, bilirubin, 
urobilinogen, nitrite, a nd leukocyte esterase 
• Urine microscopy includes, but is not limited to: detection of formed cellular elements, casts, bacteria, yeast, parasites, and cr ystals in centrifuged urine sediment 
In the event of abnormal urinalysis findings, susp icious of urinary tract infection, urine culture 
should be performed. Additionally, urine culture should be performed if at any point the PI 
suspects the presence of a urinary tract infecti on. If the urine dipstick is positive for blood, the 
central laboratory will perform reflexive testing to include microscopy. Additional testing will be 
performed according to the judgment of the Invest igator. Referral to urology/urologic evaluation 
is recommended for new or unexplained cases of confirmed hematuria (urology/urologic 
evaluation is not required where he maturia is considered to be re lated to diabetic nephropathy).

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 52 9.2.1.4 Vital signs and physical exam 
A complete physical exam (including sitting BP and heart rate, temperature and respiratory rate) 
will be performed at Visit 1 (Screening), Visit 9 (Week 26), and Visit 13 (Week 79). Abbreviated physical exams (including sitting BP and heart rate) will be performed at all other on-site visits. The abbreviated physical exam should focus on ca rdiac and respiratory systems, as well as any 
areas important for assessmen t of AEs if necessary.  
Three separate seated BPs and heart rate measur ements should be taken with at least 1 minute 
between measurements following a 5-minute rest period, and prior to phleb otomy. Full details and 
directions for the measurement of BP are presented in Appendix C .  
9.2.1.5 Electrocardiogram variables 
The ECG assessment of “normal” or “abnormal” will be analyzed. 
A 12-lead ECG record is performed locally at Screening (Visit 1), Week 26 (Visit 9), and 
Week 79 (Visit 13). 
The 12-lead ECG should be perform ed after at least 10 minutes in a supine position and prior to 
IMP administration. The Investigator should re view the ECG and document the interpretation, 
sign and date it on the ECG print out and report it in the e-CRF. Each ECG trace is analyzed in 
comparison with the screening recorded trace. All original traces are kept as source data. 
Note: Any new ECG abnormality should be r echecked for confirmation and reported as 
appropriate for that finding. 
9.2.1.6 Self-monitoring of blood glucose 
A meter for self-assessment of blood glucose will be dispensed at the Run-in visit (Visit 2). 
In addition to home measurements of self-monitored blood glucose, self-monitoring of blood 
glucose will be performed at the Run-in Visit (Visit 2), Baseline (Visit 3) and all subsequent on-site visits. Glucose meters used for SMBG di splay results as plasma glucose concentration. 
Patients will also receive a patient diary at all on-site visits with the exception of Visit 13 (End of 
Treatment visit). The diary will be reviewed at  all on-site visits from Visit 2 to Visit 13. 
Self-assessed blood glucose levels will be entered in the patient diary.  
Patients will be asked to self-a ssess fasting blood glucose levels at least 3 times a week from the 
Run-in Visit (Visit 2) to the end of the Treatme nt Period including on day of each on-site study 
visit. After Visit 9 (Week 26), if SMBG valu es are <120 mg/dL over a two-week period, the 
Investigator can (at their own discretion) instruct patients to self-monitor blood glucose once a 
week (on day of on-site study visit for weeks with on-site study visits).

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 53 Patients will also be requ ested to self-assess blood glucose le vels whenever they experience any 
illnesses (eg, cold, flu), or symptoms of hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia. Symptoms of 
hypoglycemia may include shakiness, dizziness, sweating, hunger, headache, pale skin color, sudden moodiness or behavior changes (such as cr ying for no apparent reason), clumsy or jerky 
movements, seizure, difficulty paying attention or confusion, or tingling sensations around the 
mouth. Patients will be instructed to record the presence or absence of hypoglycemic episodes or hypoglycemic symptoms in the patient diary provided. 
Patients will also be instructed to record SMBG values that are ≤70 mg/dL ( ≤3.9 mmol/L) in the 
patient diary. Patients should be instructed to contact the site if fasting SMBG values over 
3 consecutive days are:  
• >270 mg/dL (15.0 mmol/L) from Randomization up through the scheduled Week 8 Visit 
• >240 mg/dL (13.3 mmol/L) after the Week 8 visit up through the scheduled Week 12 Visit 
• >200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) after the Week 12 Vi sit and through the end of the 26-week 
double-blind Core Treatment Period 
• >170 mg/dL (9.4 mmol/L) after the Week 26 Visit through the end of the Extension 
treatment period 
9.2.1.7 Diabetic ketoacidosis 
Patients will be provide d with instructions on how to recognize the symptoms of DKA and 
instructed to contact the site (o r seek emergency medical services if after business hours) if these 
symptoms develop.  Patients shoul d have a full clinical evaluati on with laboratory testing for 
possible DKA by the Investigator or emergency me dical services physician. If such evaluation 
and laboratory testing confirm the presence of metabolic acidosis, then appropriate treatment 
should be implemented and the “Possibl e DKA” e-CRF should be completed. See Appendix B  for 
further details. 
9.3 OTHER ENDPOINTS 
9.3.1 Pharmacokinetics 
The PK endpoint is: 
• Plasma concentrations of sotagliflozin a nd its metabolite pre-dose at Week 4, 18, 26, 52, 
79, and 1 hour 30 minutes post-dose at Week 26 and 79 
Pharmacokinetic data may be subjected to a population PK analysis, which will be reported 
separately to the clinical study report (CSR).

EFC14835 - sotagliflozin Version number: 1 
Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 56 9.6 APPROPRIATENESS OF MEASUREMENTS  
The addition of sotagliflozin to background therap y consisting of sulfonyl urea treatment with or 
without metformin is expected to lower HbA1c over 26 weeks of treatment (primary efficacy 
analysis).  
The concentration of HbA1c reflects the glycemic hi story of the previous 120 days and is thus an 
index of mean glycemia, documenting glyce mic control over the past 2 to 12 weeks. 
Hemoglobin A1c has also been shown to correlate with the development of long-term 
complications of diabetes, and reduction of Hb A1c is known to reduce the risk of long-term 
microvascular complications. Therefore, HbA1c is considered an appropriate primary endpoint for 
assessing the effect of a treatment on glycemic co ntrol. The duration of study treatment (26 weeks 
for the primary HbA1c endpoint) is considered to  be sufficient for achieving stable conditions 
with IMP and for enabling an adequate assessment of time-dependent changes in HbA1c. 
The problem of weight gain in T2D is widely recognized. More than 80% of individuals with T2D 
are overweight, many at the time of diagnosis. Consequently, iatrogenic weight gain is not only unwelcome, but represents an important clinical issue that can become a barrier to the successful management of glycemic control. Therefore, in this study assessing change in body weight from 
Baseline to Week 26 is a secondary endpoint.  
Improvement in FPG has been observed with sotagliflozin in multiple studies. Therefore 
assessment of FPG is relevant in this study. Th is parameter is also considered by regulatory 
agencies to be supportive of the efficacy of an antidiabetic agent. 
Phase 2 data indicated that sotagliflozin ma y reduce SBP by 10 to 15 mmHg in patients with 
SBP ≥130 mmHg at Baseline, while having no sign ificant effect in patients with SBP 
<130 mmHg, and did not induce hypotension. Since this  could be of benefit to patients with T2D, 
this finding is being followed up as a secondary obj ective in this trial, as well as the potential in 
patients with DBP >80 mmHg. Although effects on BP in Phase 2 data were observed with the 
400 mg dose at 12 weeks, the effects will be examined at Weeks 12, 26, and 79. 
The other efficacy and safety assessments in  this study are standard, well-established 
measurements for a Phase 3 study evaluating the treatment of T2D in adult patients.  
The length of the study is cons idered appropriate for detection of the primary endpoint given the 
power estimates (see Section  11).

10.1 VISIT SCHEDULE 
The visit schedule and procedures/assessments are listed in the “Study Flow Chart” ( Section  1.2). 
The aim of this section is to provide details on how so me of the procedures/assessments should be 
performed. 
This is an out-patient study and consists of 11 on-site visits and 3 telephone visits, although 
optional on-site and/or telephone visits can be scheduled at any time for any reason during the 
study whenever considered necessary by the Investigator. The patients need to be fasting for on-site visits Visit 1 through Visit 13 (Week -4 through 
Week 79), unless instructed otherwise by the I nvestigator. Throughout the study, “fasting” is 
defined as 8 hours without food.  
Note:  If the patient is not fasting at the visits specified above, the blood sample will not be 
collected and a new appointment should be given to  the patient for the following day if possible, 
with instruction to be fasted (other procedures  can be performed as scheduled). All laboratory 
assessments will occur prior to IMP administration on the day of the visit. The Run-in visit (Visit 2) can be performed as soon as the results of all Screening tests are 
available and the patient is confirmed to be eligible for participation in the study. The visit window for Visit 4 through Visit 9 is ±3 days. Visits 10, 11, and 12 should occur at the scheduled 
timepoint ±7 days. Visit 13 (EOT) should occur from Day 548 to Day 555. For the Follow-up (Visit 14), the visit should occur within a window of ± 3 days, 2 weeks after the last dose of IMP. 
If one visit date is changed, the next visit should occur according to the original schedule, 
ie calculated from the date of Baseline visit (Visit 3, Week 0). 
For a complete list of procedures scheduled for eac h study visit please refer to the Study flowchart 
(Section  1.2), which details the procedures to be performed. 
All data obtained during the trial visits are revi ewed by the Investigator and Sub-investigators 
who are qualified in the treatment of  T2D and are trained on the study.

For screen failure patients, the following source data must be verified: patient's identification 
details, the informed consent signed by the patient, the study identification (name), dates of study visits and the main reasons for screen failure. 
10.3 HANDLING OF PATIENT TEMPORARY OR PERMANENT TREATMENT 
DISCONTINUATION AND OF PATIENT STUDY DISCONTINUATION  
The IMP should be continued whenever possibl e. In case the IMP is stopped, it should be 
determined whether the stop can be made tempor arily; permanent IMP discontinuation should be 
a last resort. Any IMP discontinuation should be fully documented in the e-CRF. In any case, the 
patient should remain in the stud y and followed for the remainder of  the study duration to collect 
vital safety status  and endpoint data. 
10.3.1 Temporary treatment discontinuation with investigational medicinal product 
Temporary treatment discontinuation may be consider ed by the Investigator because of suspected 
AEs. Lower extremity complications (such as sk in ulcers, infection, osteomyelitis, and gangrene) 
requiring treatment should lead to temporary di scontinuation of IMP. Reinitiating treatment with 
the IMP will be done under close and appropriate clinical/and or laboratory monitoring once the 
Investigator will have considered according to his/her best medical judgment that the occurrence 
of the concerned event was unlikel y to be related to the IMP. 
It is in the interest of the patient to m onitor their blood glucose during the temporary 
discontinuation period, therefore regular deter mination of SMBG is to be performed and 
documented (see Section  9.2.1.6). 
For all temporary treatment discontinuations, duration should be reco rded by the Investigator in 
the appropriate pages of the e-CRF  when considered as confirmed. 
Temporary treatment discontinuation decided by th e Investigator corresponds to more than 1 dose 
not administered to the patient. 
Use of any different anti-hyperglycemic medication during the time of temporary treatment 
discontinuation (ie, insulin during a hospitalization) is recorded as concomitant medication with the name and doses recorded in the e-CRF. 
10.3.2 Permanent treatment discontinuation with investigational medicinal product 
Permanent treatment discontinuati on is defined as any treatment discontinuation associated with 
the definitive decision from the Investigator or the patient not to re-expose the patient to the IMP at any time.

10.4.1 Definitions of adverse events  
10.4.1.1 Adverse event 
An adverse event  is any untoward medical occurrence in a pa tient or clinical i nvestigation patient 
administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal 
relationship with the study treatment. 
10.4.1.2 Serious adverse event 
A serious adverse event  is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: 
• Results in death, or 
• Is life-threatening, or 
Note: The term “life-threatening” in the definition of “serious” refers to an event in which the patient was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe. 
• Requires inpatient hos pitalization or prolongation of  existing hospitalization, or 
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or 
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect 
• Is a medically important event, 
Medical and scientific judgme nt should be exercised in deciding whether expedited 
reporting is appropriate in othe r situations, such as important medical events that may not 
be immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the 
patient or may require medical or surgical in tervention (ie, specific measures or corrective 
treatment) to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition above 
Note: The following list of medically important events is intended to serve as a guideline for determining which conditi on has to be considered a medically  important event. The list is not 
intended to be exhaustive: 
• Intensive treatment in an emer gency room or at home for: 
- Allergic bronchospasm 
- Blood dyscrasias (ie, agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia, bone marrow aplasia, myelodysplasia, pancytopenia, etc) 
- Convulsions (seizures, epilepsy, epileptic fit, absence, etc) 
• Development of drug de pendence or drug abuse 
• ALT >3 × ULN + total bilirubin >2 × ULN or asymptomatic ALT increase >10 × ULN 
• Suicide attempt or any even t suggestive of suicidality

10.4.1.3 Adverse event of special interest 
An AESI is an AE (serious or non-serious) of scientific and medical concern specific to the 
Sponsor’s product or program, for which ongoin g monitoring and rapid communication by the 
Investigator to the Sponsor may be appropriate. Such events may require further investigation in 
order to characterize and understand them. AESI s may be added or removed during a study by 
protocol amendment. 
The AESI for this study are: 
• Pregnancy of a female patient entered in a study as well as pregnancy occurring in a 
female partner of a male patient entered in a study with IMP/NIMP: 
- Pregnancy occurring in a female patient included in the clinical trial or in a female 
partner of a male patient entered in the clinical trial. It will be qualified as an SAE only if it fulfills one of the seriousness criteria (see Section  10.4.1.2) 
- In the event of pregnancy in a fema le patient, IMP shoul d be discontinued 
- Follow-up of the pregnancy in a female patient or in a female partner of a male patient 
is mandatory until the outcome has been determined 
• Symptomatic overdose with IMP/NIMP: 
- A symptomatic overdose (accidental or intentional) with the IMP/NIMP is an event 
suspected by the Investigator or spontaneous ly notified by the patient and resulting in 
clinical symptoms and/or signs accompanied by administration of more than twice the intended daily dose within a 24-hour period. It  will be recorded in the e-CRF as an 
AESI with immediate notification “Symptomatic OVERDOSE (accidental or intentional)” in all cases and will be qualified as an SAE only if it fulfills the SAE criteria 
- (Please note that an Asymptomatic over dose with the IMP/NIMP, accidental or 
intentional, defined administration of more than twice the intended daily dose within a 24-hour period, without clinical symptoms a nd/or signs, either suspected by the 
Investigator or spontaneously notified by the patient, not based on accountability 
assessment. It will be recorded as an AE “Asymptomatic OVERDOSE, accidental or intentional”)

An EOSI is a serious or non-serious AE of scientific and medical concern specific to the 
Sponsor’s product or program, for which ongoing monitoring may be appropriate. Such events may require further investigation in order to characterize and understand them. These events 
should be reported on the specific e-CRF page (where applicable) and will only qualify for 
expedited reporting when serious (fulfilling SAE criteria). 
The EOSI for this study are: 
• Major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE [cardiovascular death, MI, or stroke]) and 
other specific CV events (eg, heart failure leading to hospitalization) 
• Severe hypoglycemia (see Section  10.6.1) 
• Genital mycotic infections (to include vulvova ginal candidiasis in females and candidal 
balanitis in males) 
• Urinary tract infections 
• Clinically relevant volume de pletion and events related/possibly related to volume 
depletion 
• Diarrhea 
• Pancreatitis 
• Bone fractures 
• Venous thrombotic events to include deep venous thrombosis and thromboembolism (to 
include pulmonary embolism) 
• Diabetic ketoacidosis 
• Renal events to include 50% decline in eGFR, end stage kidney disease, renal death 
• Malignancies of special interest (breast, bladder, renal cell, Leydig cell, pancreatic, 
prostate, and thyroid carcinoma) 
• Adverse event leading to an amputation 
10.4.2 General guidelines for reporting adverse events 
• All AEs, regardless of seriousness or rela tionship to IMP/NIMP, spanning from the 
signature of the ICF until the end of the study as defined by the protocol for that patient, 
are to be recorded on the corresponding page(s) or screen(s) of the e-CRF 
• Whenever possible, diagnosis or single syndrome should be reported instead of symptoms. 
The Investigator should specify the date of onset, intensity, action taken with respect to 
IMP, corrective treatment/therapy given, additional investigations performed, outcome, and his/her opinion as to whether there is a reasonable possibility that the AE was caused by the IMP or by the study procedure(s)

make it difficult to assess the causal relationship, particularly for hypoglycemia. 
Global Safety Officer with input from ot her appropriate study team members will 
determine the causal relationship when it is not clearly provided by the Investigator 
• The Investigator should take appropriate measur es to follow all AEs until clinical recovery 
is complete and laboratory results have returned to normal, or until progression has been stabilized, or until death, in order to ensure the safety of the patients. This may imply that observations will continue beyond the last plan ned visit per protocol , and that additional 
investigations may be requested by the monito ring team up to as noticed by the Sponsor 
• When treatment is prematurely discontinued, the patient’s observations will continue until 
the end of the study as defined by  the protocol for that patient 
• Laboratory, vital signs or ECG abnormalities ar e to be recorded as AEs if they are 
medically relevant based on the Inve stigator’s medical judgment, eg:  
- Symptomatic and/or  
- Requiring either corrective trea tment or consu ltation, and/or  
- Leading to IMP discontinuation or modification of dosing, and/or  
- Fulfilling a seriousness criterion, and/or  
- Defined as an AESI or EOSI 
10.4.3 Instructions for reporting serious adverse events 
In the case of occurrence of an SAE, the Investigator or any designees must immediately: 
• ENTER (within 24 hours) the information related to the SAE in the appropriate screens of 
the e-CRF; the system will automatically send a notification to the Monitoring team and 
Pharmacovigilance after approval of the Investigator within the e-CRF 
• SEND (preferably by fax or e-mail) a photocop y of all examinations carried out and the 
dates on which these examinations were perform ed, to the representative of the monitoring 
team whose name, fax number, and email addr ess appear on the clin ical trial protocol. 
Care should be taken to ensure that the patient's identity is protected and the patient's identifiers in the clinical trial are properly mentioned on any copy of a source document provided to the Sponsor. For laboratory results, include the laboratory normal ranges 
• All further data updates should be recorded in the e-CRF as appropriate, and further 
documentation as well as additional information (for laboratory data, concomitant medications, patient status, etc)  should be sent (by fax or e- mail) to the monitoring team 
within 24 hours of knowledge of the SAE. In addition, every effort should be made to 
further document any SAE that is fatal or life-threatening within a week (7 days) of the 
initial notification 
• A back-up plan (using a paper case report form  [CRF] process) is av ailable and should be 
used when the e-CRF system does not work

10.4.4 Guidelines for reporting adverse events of special interest  
For AESIs, the Sponsor/CRO must be informed immediately (ie, within 24 hours), as per SAE notification guidelines described in Section  10.4.3, even if not fulfilling a seriousness criterion, 
using the corresponding pages of the CRF (t o be sent) or screens in the e-CRF. 
10.4.5 Guidelines for reporting events of special interest 
If an EOSI fulfills the criteria of an SAE,  reporting should be performed according to the 
instructions for reporting of SAEs (see Section  10.4.3). Otherwise, reporting should follow the 
instructions for an AE (see Section  10.4.2). 
10.4.6 Guidelines for management of specific laboratory abnormalities 
Decision trees for the management of certain laboratory abnormalities by Sanofi are provided in Appendix D . 
The following laboratory abnormalities should be monitored, docum ented, and managed 
according to the related flow chart in protocol appendices.

10.6 SAFETY INSTRUCTIONS 
10.6.1 Hypoglycemia 
During the study, patients are instructed to do cument any hypoglycemic episodes in their study 
diary. The hypoglycemia will be reported in the specific e-CRF page with onset date and time, 
symptoms and/or signs, the SMBG value if available, and the treatment. If the event fulfills SAE criteria, the hypoglycemia will also be reported as an SAE. 
Hypoglycemia is categorized according to the ADA workgroup on hypoglycemia classification 
(12)(13) and summarized in Figure 1 . 
In addition to the threshold of ≤3.9 mmol/L ( ≤70 mg/dL), hypoglycemia episodes with a plasma 
glucose of <3.0 mmol/L (<54 mg/dL) will be analyzed separately.

PG: plasma glucose; SAE: serious adverse event. 
Severe hypoglycemia 
Severe hypoglycemia is an event requiring assistance of another person to actively administer 
carbohydrate, glucagon, intravenous glucose or ot her resuscitative actions. These episodes may be 
associated with sufficient neuroglycopenia to induce seizure, unconsciousness or coma. Self-monitored plasma glucose values may not be available, but neurological recovery attributable to the restoration of plasma gluc ose to normal is considered sufficient evidence that the event was 
induced by a low plasma glucose concentration. 
Note
: “requiring assistance of another person” means that the patient could not help himself or 
herself to treat the hypoglycemia. Assisting a patient out of kindness, when assistance is not 
required, should not be considered a “requires assistance” incident. 
Any hypoglycemic event which leads to uncons ciousness, coma, or seizure should also be 
reported as an SAE.  
Documented symptomatic hypoglycemia 
Documented symptomatic hypoglycemia is an event during which typical symptoms of 
hypoglycemia accompanied by a measured plasma glucose concentration of ≤3.9 mmol/L 
(≤70 mg/dL).

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 77 Clinical symptoms that are considered to result from a hypoglycemic episode are eg, increased 
sweating, nervousness, asthenia/weakness, tremor , dizziness, increased appetite, palpitations, 
headache, sleep disorder, confusion, seizures, unconsciousness, or coma. 
Asymptomatic hypoglycemia 
Asymptomatic hypoglycemia is an event not acco mpanied by typical symptoms of hypoglycemia 
but with a measured plasma glucose concentration ≤3.9 mmol/L ( ≤70 mg/dL).   
Note:  low plasma glucose values without symptoms or signs should not be reported more than 
once within 30 minutes. Repeated low glucose valu es within a short period could be due to 
malfunction of the device, error testing or following up a low glucose reading. The Investigator 
should try not to document false low SMBG va lues or redundant low glucose values as 
asymptomatic hypoglycemic events. Further clarification with the patients is needed. 
Probable symptomatic hypoglycemia 
Probable symptomatic hypoglycemia is an event during which symptoms of hypoglycemia are not 
accompanied by a plasma glucose determination, ( but that was presumably caused by a plasma 
glucose concentration ≤3.9 mmol/L [ ≤70 mg/dL]), ie, symptoms treated with oral carbohydrate 
without  a test of plasma glucose.  
Relative hypoglycemia 
Relative hypoglycemia, recently termed “pseudo-hypoglycemia” ( 14), is an event during which 
the patient reports typical symptoms of hypoglycemia, and interprets the symptoms as indicative 
of hypoglycemia, but with a measured plasma  glucose concentration >3.9 mmol/L (>70 mg/dL).

11.1 DETERMINATION OF SAMPLE SIZE 
The sample size/power calcula tions are based on the primary variable, change from Baseline to 
Week 26 in HbA1c. Assuming a common standard deviation (SD) of 1.2%  and using a 2-sided 
test at a 0.05 α -level, 250 patients per arm will have at least 99% power to detect a treatment 
difference of 0.6% in mean HbA1c change from Baseline to Week 26 between sotagliflozin 
400 mg and placebo. 
The number of patients taking a sulfonylurea and metformin w ill be limited to 330 patients, to 
ensure sufficient numbers of sulfonylurea monotherapy patients.

A list of patients prematurely discontinued from the treatment, along with reasons for 
discontinuation, will be pr ovided. Similarly, a list of patients prematurely discontinued from the 
study, along with reasons for discontinuation, w ill be provided. 
Patients treated but not randomiz ed, patients randomized but not treated and patients randomized 
but not treated as randomized will be identified and described in separa te listings. The safety 
experience of patients treated and not randomized will be reported separately, and these patients 
will not be in the safety population. 
For any patient randomized more than once, only th e data associated with the first randomization

randomization will be assessed separately. 
11.3 ANALYSIS POPULATIONS 
11.3.1 Efficacy populations 
Efficacy analyses will be based on the treatment group allocated by the IRT according to the 
randomization schedule at randomiz ation visit (as randomized), irrespective of the treatment 
actually received. 
11.3.1.1 Intention–to-treat population 
Efficacy analyses will be based on the ITT population, defined as all randomized patients, 
irrespective of compliance with the study protocol and procedures. Patients will be analyzed for efficacy analyses according to the treatment group to which they are randomized. 
11.3.2 Safety population 
Safety analyses will be based on the safety population, defined as all randomized patients who 
receive at least 1 dose of double-blind IMP (regardless of the amount of treatment administered). 
Patients will be analyzed for safety analyses  according to the treatment actually received. 
In addition: 
• Nonrandomized but treated patie nts will not be part of the safety population, but their 
safety data will be presented separately 
• Randomized patients for whom it is unclear whether they took the study medication will 
be included in the safety population as randomized 
• When a patient is exposed to both sotagliflozi n and placebo, the patient will be analyzed in 
the sotagliflozin group

documented evidence (ie, all study dates reco rded as no medication taken) that patients 
have not taken the study medication 
11.4 STATISTICAL METHODS 
Continuous data will be summa rized by treatment group using the number of observations 
available (N), mean, SD, minimum, median, and maximum. Categorical data will be summarized 
by treatment group using count and percentage. 
In general, descriptive statistics of quantitative efficacy and safety parameters (result and change from Baseline) by scheduled visits will be provided on observed cases (OC), ie, inclusion of only patients having non-missing asse ssments at a specific visit. 
The Baseline value is defined ge nerally as the last available value before the first dose of 
double-blind IMP or the last available value prior to randomization for patients who were 
randomized but never exposed to IMP.  
For serum creatinine and eGFR, the Baseline value is  defined as the average of all values before 
the first dose of double-blind IMP for those rando mized and exposed or before randomization for 
those who were randomized but never exposed to IMP. Analysis of demographics and Baseline characteristics, prior and concomitant medications will be 
provided in detail in the statistical analysis plan (SAP). 
11.4.1 Extent of study treatment exposure and compliance 
The extent of study treatment exposure and compliance will be assessed and summarized by actual treatment received in the safety population. 
11.4.1.1 Extent of investigational medicinal product exposure 
The extent of study treatment exposure will be assessed by the duration of treatment exposure during the study.  
The duration of treatment exposure will be the total number of days of administration of the 
double-blind IMP, regardless of unplanned interm ittent discontinuations . The duration of IMP 
exposure will be calculated as: 
(Date of the last double-blind IMP taken – Date of the first double-blind IMP taken) + 1. The number (%) of patients randomized and exposed to double-blind IMP will be presented by 
specific time periods for each treatment group. The time  periods of interest will be defined in the 
SAP.

in the safety population. 
11.4.1.2 Compliance  
A given administration will be c onsidered noncompliant if the pa tient did not take the planned 
dose of treatment as required by the protocol. No imputation will be made for patients with 
missing or incomplete data. 
Treatment compliance, above-planned and under-planned dosing perc entages, will be summarized 
descriptively (N, mean, SD, medi an, minimum, and maximum). The percentage of patients with 
compliance <80% will be summarized. In addition, th e number and percentage of patients with at 
least 1 above-planned dosing administration will be given, as well as the number and percentage 
of patients with 0, >0 to 20%, and >20% under-planned dosing administrations. 
11.4.2 Analyses of efficacy endpoints 
Efficacy analyses will be performed on the ITT population. 
Statistical testing will be performed for primary  endpoint and secondary endpoints at Week 26 (or 
Week 12 for SBP). All efficacy variables after W eek 26 will only be summarized by descriptive 
statistics without formal statistical testing. 
11.4.2.1 Analysis of primary efficacy endpoint 
The statistical test will be two-sided tests at a nominal 5% significance level. Analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint (change from Baseline to Week 26 in HbA1c; 
see Section  9.1.1) will be performed on the ITT populati on, using HbA1c measurements obtained 
from visits during the study, including those obtai ned after IMP discontinuation or introduction of 
rescue therapy. 
The primary efficacy endpoint of change in HbA1c from Baseline to Week 26 will be analyzed 
with missing values imputed by control-base d multiple imputation method under the missing not 
at random framework.  
• For placebo patients, missing data will be imputed based on the placebo group data 
• For patients in the sotagliflozin group, missing da ta will be imputed as if the patients were 
on placebo throughout the study, where all patients’ measurements including the on-treatment measurements will be considered as if the measurements were from the 
placebo in the imputation model 
Each of the complete datasets will be analyzed by an Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) model 
with treatment groups (sotagliflozin, pl acebo), randomization stratum of HbA1c ( ≤8.5%, >8.5%), 
randomization stratum of metformin use at Screening (Yes, No), randomization stratum of SBP (<130, ≥ 130 mmHg), and country as fixed effects, a nd Baseline HbA1c value as a covariate.

HbA1c from Baseline to Week 26 for each treatment group, as well as the between-group 
difference (comparing sotagliflozin versus placeb o) and the 95% confidence interval (CI) for the 
difference.  
Summary statistics (for screening value, Baselin e value, observed values, and observed changes 
from Baseline) at scheduled visits will be provided for each treatment group. The summary will 
include the number of observations, mean, SD , standard error (SE), minimum, median, and 
maximum. Graphical presentations will also be used to examine trends over time using mean values (± SE) and mean changes from Baseline (± SE) at each of the scheduled visits (using OC). 
Assessment of treatment effect by subgroup 
Descriptive analyses will be performed on the primary endpoint to summarize the treatment 
effects across subgroups defined by the fo llowing Baseline or Screening factors: 
• Race 
• Ethnicity (Hispanic, Not Hispanic) 
• Age group (<50 years, ≥50 to <65 years, ≥65 years) 
• Gender 
• Baseline BMI level (<30, ≥30 kg/m
2) 
• Baseline HbA1c ( ≤8.5%, >8.5%) 
• Metformin use at Screening (Yes, No) 
• Baseline SBP (<130 mmHg, ≥ 130 mmHg) 
• Country 
The treatment effects across the subgroups defined for each of these factors will be estimated for 
the change from Baseline to Week 26 in HbA1c in the ITT population, and using a similar 
approach to the analysis for the primary effica cy endpoint. The adjusted estimates of treatment 
mean differences (sotagliflozin versus placebo) with SE and 95% CIs will be provided as appropriate across the subgroups. 
In the event that the subgroup factor is identi cal or similar to a randomization strata factor 
(eg, Baseline HbA1c category), only the subgroup fact or will be included in the model in order to 
avoid the issue of collinearity in the analysis. 
11.4.2.2 Analyses of secondary efficacy endpoints 
The secondary endpoints (see Section  9.1.2) will be analyzed using a similar approach to the 
primary efficacy endpoint with missing values  imputed by control-based multiple imputation 
method under the missing not at random framework.  
• For placebo patients, missing data will be imputed based on the placebo group data

For each of the continuous secondary endpoints, each  of the complete datasets will be analyzed by 
an ANCOVA model with treatment groups (sotag liflozin, placebo), rando mization stratum of 
HbA1c (≤8.5%, >8.5%), randomization st ratum of metformin use at Screening (Yes, No), 
randomization stratum of SBP (<130 mmHg, ≥130 mmHg), and country as fixed effects, and 
Baseline secondary endpoint value as a covariate. For the analysis of SBP in patients with 
Baseline SBP ≥ 130 mmHg, the randomization stratum of  SBP will not be included in the 
ANCOVA model. Results from each complete datase t will be combined to provide the adjusted 
mean change from Baseline to Week 26 (or Week 12 for SBP) for each treatment group, as well as the between-group difference (comparing sotag liflozin versus placebo) and the 95% CI for the 
difference.  
The categorical secondary efficacy variables of  HbA1c <6.5%, <7% at Week 26 will be analyzed 
using a Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel method stra tified by randomization stratum of HbA1c 
(≤8.5%, >8.5%), randomization stratum of metformin use at Screening (Yes, No), and 
randomization stratum of SBP (<130 mmHg, ≥130 mmHg). The proportion in each treatment 
group will be provided, as well as the difference of  proportions between sota gliflozin and placebo 
with associated 2-sided 95% CI. For HbA1c responders at Week 26 (<6.5%, <7% respectively), 
all values at Week 26 will be used to determine whether a patient is a responder or not, even if 
they are measured after IMP discontinuation or  rescue medication use.  Patients who have no 
HbA1c measurement at Week 26 w ill be treated as non-responders. 
For all secondary endpoints, summa ry statistics at scheduled visits will be provided for each 
treatment group. The summary will include the nu mber of observations, mean, SD, SE, minimum, 
median, and maximum. Graphical presentations will also be used to examine trends over time using mean values (± SE) and mean changes from Ba seline (± SE) at each of the scheduled visits 
(using OC). 
11.4.2.3 Analyses of other efficacy endpoints 
The analysis of other endpoints (see Section  9.1.3) will be descriptive with no formal testing. 
Summary statistics at scheduled visits using OC will be provided by each treatment group. 
Graphical presentations will also be used to illustrate trends over time. 
11.4.2.4 Multiplicity considerations 
To control the family-wise type I error, a fixed-sequence testing procedure will be applied. 
Once the main study primary variable (change from Baseline to Week 26 in HbA1c) is 
statistically significant at α = 0.05 (2-sided), a hierarchical testing procedure will be performed to 
test the following main study secondary efficacy va riables by the following prioritized order. The 
testing will stop as soon as an endpoint is f ound to be not statistically significant at α = 0.05

11.4.3 Analyses of safety data 
Safety endpoints are presented in Section  9.2. The summary of safety results will be presented by 
treatment group. The safety data will be summarized for the 26-w eek Core Treatment Period and 
the entire treatment period separately, unless specified otherwise. All safety analyses will be 
performed on the Safety population as defined in Section  11.3.2 using the following common 
rules: 
The following definitions will be applied to laboratory parameters and vital signs: 
• The potentially clinically significant abnorma lity (PCSA) values for clinical laboratory 
tests and vital signs are define d as abnormal values considered  medically important by the 
Sponsor’s Global Pharmacovigilance and Epidemiology department and in effect at the 
time of the final SAP approval. PCSA criteria for parameters not cited in the protocol as safety parameters will not be analyzed 
• PCSA criteria will determine which patients had at least 1 PCSA during the on-treatment 
period, taking into account all evaluations  performed during the on-treatment period, 
including unscheduled or repeated evaluations. The number of all such patients will be the 
numerator for the on-treatment PCSA percentage 
The “observation periods” defined in Section  9.2.1 are applicable for classification of AEs, 
determination of on-treat ment PCSA values and the last on- treatment value for the laboratory, 
vital sign and ECG parameters. 
11.4.3.1 Analysis of adverse events 
Pre-treatment AEs  are AEs that developed or worsened or became serious during the 
pre-treatment period. 
Treatment-emergent AEs  are AEs that developed or worsened  (according to the Investigator’s 
opinion) or became serious during the on-treatment period. Post-treatment AEs  are AEs that developed or worsened or became serious during the 
post-treatment period. The primary focus of AE reporting in the CSR will be on TEAEs. Pre- and post-treatment AEs 
will be described separately.

information 
DEFINITIONS 
Nonreproductive potential 
1. Premenopausal female with 1 of the following: - Documented hysterectomy 
- Documented bilateral salpingectomy 
- Documented bilateral oophorectomy 
2. Postmenopausal - A postmenopausal state is defined as no mens es for 12 months without an alternative 
medical cause. A high follicle stimulating hor mone (FSH) level in the postmenopausal 
range may be used to confirm a postmenopausal state in women not using hormonal 
contraception or hormonal replacement ther apy (HRT). However, in the absence of 
12 months of amenorrhea, a single  FSH measurement is insufficient 
- Females on HRT and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use 1 of the highly effective contraception methods if  they wish to continue their HRT during 
the study. Otherwise, they must disc ontinue HRT to allo w confirmation of 
postmenopausal status before study enrollment 
Reproductive potential  (WOCBP)  
A woman is considered of reproductive potential (WOCBP), ie, fertile, following menarche and until becoming postmenopausal unless permanently  sterile. Permanent sterilization methods 
include hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy and bilateral oophorectomy. 
CONTRACEPTIVE GUIDANCE 
Women of reproductive potential (WOCBP) must us e a highly effective method of contraception 
during the treatment period and the post-treatment follow up peri od (14 ±3 days). If another 
contraceptive method is used (such as a barrier method), it should be used in combination with 
one of the highly effective methods (such as an oral contraceptive).

Highly Effective Contraceptive Methods That Are User Dependent 
Failure rate of <1% per year when used consistently and correctlya 
• Combined (estrogen- and progestogen-containing ) hormonal contraception associated 
with inhibition of ovulation: 
- Oral 
- Intravaginal 
- Transdermal  
• Progestogen-only hormone contraception asso ciated with inhibition of ovulation: 
- Oral 
- Injectable  
Highly Effective Methods That Are User Independent 
• Implantable progestogen-only hormone cont raception associated with inhibition of 
ovulation 
• Intrauterine device (IUD) 
• Intrauterine hormone-releasing system (IUS) 
• Bilateral tubal occlusion 
• Vasectomized partner 
(Vasectomized partner is a highly effective contraceptive method provided that the partner is the sole 
sexual partner of the woman of childbearing potential and the absence of sperm has been confirmed. If 
not, an additional highly effective method(s) of contraception should be used. Spermatogenesis cycle is 
approximately 90 days.)  
• Sexual abstinence 
(Sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if defined as refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the study drug. The reliability 
of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the duration of the study and the preferred and 
usual lifestyle of the patient.)  
NOTE: 
a Typical use failure rates may differ from those when used consistently and correctly. Use should be consistent with local regul ations 
regarding the use of contraceptive methods for patients participating in clinical studies.

Male patients with partners of reproductive potential who become pregnant  
• The Investigator will attempt to collect pregnancy information on any female partner of a 
male study patient who becomes pregnant while participating in this study. This applies 
only to patients who receive study treatment 
• After obtaining the necessary signed informed  consent from the pregnant female partner 
directly, the Investigator will record pregnancy information on the appropriate form and submit it to the Sponsor/CRO within 24 hours of learning of the partner’s pregnancy 
• Partner will also be followed to determine the outcome of the pregnancy. Information on the status of the mother and child will be forwarded to the Sponsor 
• Generally, follow-up will be no longer than 6 to 8 weeks following the estimated delivery 
date. Any termination of the pregnancy will be reported regardless of fetal status (presence or absence of anomalies) or indication for procedure 
Female patients who become pregnant  
• The Investigator will collect pregnancy information on any female patient, who becomes 
pregnant while participating in this study 
• Information will be recorded on the appropri ate form and submitted to the Sponsor/CRO 
within 24 hours of learning of  a participant's pregnancy 
• Participant will be followed to determine the outcome of the pregnancy. The Investigator 
will collect follow-up information on participant and neonate, which will be forwarded to the Sponsor. Generally, follow-up will not be re quired for longer than 6 to 8 weeks beyond 
the estimated delivery date  
• Any termination of pregnancy will be reported, regardless of fetal status (presence or absence of anomalies) or indication for procedure 
• While pregnancy itself is not considered to be  an AE or SAE, any pregnancy complication 
or elective termination of a pregnancy will be reported as an AE or SAE 
• A spontaneous abortion is always considered to be an SAE and will be reported as such 
• Any SAE occurring as a result of a post-stud y pregnancy which is considered reasonably 
related to the study treatment by the Inves tigator, will be reported to the Sponsor as 
described in Section  10.4.1.2. While the Investigator is not obligated to actively seek this 
information in former study patients, he or she may learn of an SAE through spontaneous 
reporting

hydration and recognizing diabetic ketoacidosis 
Patients with T2D are at risk for developing genitourinary (GU) infections. The following 
guidelines should be communicated to females an d uncircumcised males regarding GU infections. 
Patient communication cards will be printed with the following: 
For females: 
“The following advice may be useful in helpin g you to keep your bladder and urethra free from 
infection: 
• Go to the toilet as soon as you feel the need to urinate, rather than holding it in 
• Wipe from front to back after going to the toilet 
• Practice good hygiene by washing your gen itals every day, and before having sex 
• Empty your bladder after having sex”  
For uncircumcised males: 
“The following advice may be useful in helpin g you to keep the foreskin free from infection: 
• Wash the end of your penis and foreskin with soap and water (do not let soap get in the 
opening) 
• After your shower or bath, dry the end of your penis and foreskin properly and replace the foreskin 
• Also, when you urinate, slide the foreskin back enough so that urine does not get on the foreskin-this helps to keep it clean” 
Maintaining Hydration: 
Sodium-glucose co-transporter type 2 inhibitors are associated with osmotic diuresis and volume 
depletion, which may lead to dizz iness or hypotension, especially in the elderly. Before initiating 
study drug (at Screening, Run-in and Randomization)  and during all on-site study visits thereafter, 
assess volume status in patients with  renal impairment, the elderly, in patients with low SBP, or if 
receiving diuretics, angiotensin- converting-enzyme inhibitors, or angiotensin receptor blockers. 
All patients will be advised to maintain proper fluid intake and to consider increasing it if they sense greater thirst, more urine producti on, or if they feel dizzy or faint. 
Patient communication cards will be printed with the following for patients with T2D: 
“The following advice may be useful in helpin g you to maintain prope r hydration and prevent 
dehydration: 
• Dehydration is when your body loses too much fluid, frequently due to diarrhea or 
increased urination

- You sense greater thirst than usual 
- You have a dry mouth or cracked lips 
- You have a fever 
- You have diarrhea or vomiting 
- You urinate more frequently or in larger amounts than usual 
- You get up in the middle of the night to urinate (more than usual) 
- You feel dizzy or light-headed 
- You exercise, or when it is hot outside”  
Recognizing Diabetic Ketoacidosis 
Potential gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events occurring with sotagliflozin may mask presenting 
symptoms of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). Patient communication cards will be printed with the following: 
“If you have any of these symptoms on the list, then contact your study site immediately for 
assistance with managing your diabetes: 
• Inability to maintain oral intake 
• Generalized weakness 
• Abdominal (belly) pain 
• Increased weight loss 
• Fever 
• Frequent urination, including at night 
• Fruity-scented breath 
• Confusion 
• Acute illness 
• Consistently elevated blood glucose 
• Feeling very thirsty or drinking a lot 
• Nausea or vomiting 
• Having trouble thinking clearly or feeling tired 
It is possible to have DKA even if your blood glucose is not elevated. Regardless of your blood 
glucose level, if you have any of these sympto ms on the list, then contact your study site 
regarding the need to be evaluated for possible DKA, which will include specific blood testing. If

for evaluation. 
If you are scheduled for a procedure or surgery th at requires you to not take any food or liquids, 
please contact your study doctor fo r instructions on continuing study drug. In such cases your 
study doctor may advise you NOT to take your st udy drug from the day prior to the procedure or 
surgery until after the procedure or surgery is co mplete, and you are taking food and liquids as 
you normally do.” Whenever adverse event (AE) data is collected or the patient reports DKA or intercurrent illness 
(including infections), generalized weakness, increased weight loss, GI symptoms including 
nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain or other symptoms or signs that the Investigator believes may be consistent with DKA, then the site  will determine if an assessment for DKA is 
appropriate. If laboratory testin g confirms presence of metabo lic acidosis, then the “Possible 
DKA” electronic case report form (e-CRF) will be completed.

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 107 Appendix C Measurement of Bl ood Pressure and Pulse Rate 
Equipment 
1. Blood pressure measurements will be taken by an automated BP monitor or a manual 
sphygmomanometer. The same equipment shoul d be used throughout the study and should 
be calibrated as per ma nufacturer recommendation 
2. Bladder Length – Should nearly or completely encircle the patient’s arm. For many adults, 
the standard “adult” size bladder is not l ong enough and the “large” size bladder is 
recommended 
3. Bladder Width – Should be at least 40% of the bladder length 
Patient Factors 
Extraneous variables associated  with the measurement of BP should be minimized. These include: 
1. Food intake, caffeine-containing beverages, cigarette smoking, or strenuous exercise 
within 2 hours prior to measurement 
2. Full urinary bladder 
3. The patient should not be allowed to talk while BP is being measured 
4. The patient should be placed in the examination room and the cuff should be placed on the patient’s nondominant arm. The proper sized cuff should fit snugly with the lower edge 2 to 3 cm above the antecubital fossa 
5. The patient should be allowed to sit quietly in a comfortably warm place (temperature 
around 25°C or 77°F) for 5 minutes with the arm supported at heart level, preferably with 
the cuff in place and with no restrictive cl othing on the arm. The patient should be 
encouraged not to tense his or her muscles 
Nondominant Arm 
The patient’s nondominant arm should be the arm d eclared by the patient as being nondominant. 
The nondominant arm should then be used for all s eated BP measurements throughout the study. 
Measurement Technique At all other on-site visits, following the 5-minut e rest period, 3 separate seated BPs should be 
measured in the arm selected at Visit 1, with at least 1 minute between BP measurements and with 
the cuff fully deflated between measurements. 
All 3 BPs will be recorded in the patient’s electronic case report form (e-CRF). The mean of the 
3 seated BPs will constitute the BP value for that visit. 
Three seated pulse rate measurements will be obtained. The mean of the 3 seated pulse rate 
measurements will constitute the pulse rate value for that visit.

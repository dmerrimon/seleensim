 PROTOCOL SYNOPSIS AC- 055H301 
TITLE Prospective, multi -center, double -blind, randomized, 
placebo -controlled, parallel -group study assessing the efficacy 
and safety of macitentan in Fontan -palliated adult and 
adolescent subjects.  
ACRONYM  RUBATO  
PRospective, m Ulti-center, double -Blind, r Andomized, 
placebo -conTrolled, parallel -group study assessing the 
efficacy and safety of macitentan in F Ontan- palliated adult and 
adolescent subjects.  
OBJECTIVES  Primary objective  
To assess the effect of macitentan on exercise capacity 
(measured by peak oxygen uptake  [VO 2]) in comparison with 
placebo in Fontan- palliated subjects.  
Secondary objectives  
To assess the effect of macitentan on long- term exercise 
capacity  (measured by peak VO 2 over 52 weeks). 
To assess the effect of macitentan on daily Physical Activity measured by Accelerometer (PA -Ac).  
To evaluate the safety and tolerability of macitentan.  
Other objectives  
Other objectives are described in Section  2.3.
 
DESIGN  A prospective, adaptive, multi -center, double -blind, 
randomized, placebo- controlled, parallel -group, Phase  3 study.  
The study contains an interim analysis (IA) for unblinded sample size adaptation, based on comparative interim results on the primary efficacy endpoint . This IA  will be implemented 
through an Independent Data Monitoring Committee ( IDMC), 
providing recommendations to the Sponsor  Committee . Only 
the IDMC and the 
Independent Statistical Analysis Center 
(ISAC) /statistical Support Group (SSG) will be unblinded to 
the data.

 PERIODS  Screening period:  
Lasts up to 30 days; starts with the signature of the informed 
consent (Visit 1) and ends with the subject ’s Randomization 
(Visit 2). 
Treatment period:  
Starts with the administration of the first dose of study 
treatment (Visit 2) and ends on the day of the last dose of study 
treatment, expected to be at 52 weeks.  
Subjects who prematurely and permanently discontinue study 
treatment before Week  52 (Visit  6) must have a premature 
End-of-Treatment (EOT) visit as soon as possible  but not later 
than 7 days after the last dose of study drug. 
Safety follow -up (S- FU) period:  
After permanent study treatment discontinuation, subjects will 
be followed up for a minimum of  30 days (S- FU).  
Subjects eligible to enter the AC 055H302 open- label (OL) 
extension study may do so as soon as their eligibility has been confirmed, even prior to completion of the full S -FU period. 
The period ends with administration of first study  drug in the 
OL extension study. 
Post-treatment observation period (PTOP):  
Those subjects who prematurely and permanently discontinue 
study treatment  will enter the PTOP after their S -FU period is 
completed . The PTOP lasts until the planned study EOT (at 
most 52 weeks after Randomization)  for each individual 
subject. This last visit of the PTOP is called  End-of-PTOP 
(EOP ). The PTOP consists of an abbreviated schedule of 
assessments at 90-day intervals . 
End-of-Study (E OS):  
EOS is reached by an individual subject: 
• when the S- FU period has been completed (for those 
subjects who do not discontinue study treatment 
prematurely), or

 • when the S-FU period and PTOP have been completed  
(for those subjects who discontinue study treatment 
prematurely), or  
• if subjects enter the AC-055H302 RUBATO open-
label (OL) extension study , with first administration of 
OL study drug. 
For all subjects, EOS corresponds to the last visit performed in this AC-055H301 RUBATO double-blind study.  
Study Closure (SCL) will be announced by the sponsor when all subjects have reached their EOS  in AC-055H301 
RUBATO.  Vital Status Follow -up (VSFU ): 
A VSFU will be performed  within 8 weeks after the SCL 
announcement to determine each vital status of all subjects 
randomized in AC- 055H301 RUBATO , irrespective  of 
whether the subject is included in the AC-055H302 OL 
extension study. 
Study Closure (SCL) : 
The SCL applies to all randomized subjects and will occu r: 
• when all subjects have had their individual VSFU , and 
• no later than 8  weeks after SCL announcement.  
PLANNED DURATION  Approximately 34 months from first subject , first visit to last 
subject, last visit.  
SITE(S)  
/ COUNTRY(IES)  31 investigational sites in 11 countries  (planned) .  
SUBJECTS / GROUPS  At least  134 adults and adolescents will be randomized in a 
1:1 ratio to macitentan 10  mg or placebo. Randomization will 
be stratified by geographical region (America, Europe, Asia, Oceania). 
The sample size will be re -estimated at the time of the  IA based 
on treatment effect and variability  estimates for the primary 
efficacy endpoint (i.e., change from baseline to Week  16 in 
peak  VO 2), following rules as described in the Statistical

STATISTICAL 
METHODOLOGY  All statistical analyses will be conducted by Actelion or by 
designated CROs supervised by Actelion, except for the IA, which will be conducted by the ISAC /SSG  who will provide 
results to the IDMC . 
A Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) will provide full details of 
the analyses, data displays, and algorithms to be used for data derivations.  
This study implements one IA for unblinded sample size 
re-estimation  and the statistical methods are described below.   
Analysis sets 
Analyses for the primary , secondary and other efficacy 
endpoints will be carried out on the Full Analysis Set (FAS ), 
which comprises all randomized subjects within the treatment group to which they were randomized.  
Additional sensitivity analyses of the primary endpoint will be 
conducted on the FAS , applying ranking, observed case 
approach without imputation, and on the Per -Protocol Set 
(PPS) to assess the robustness of the results of the primary 
statistical analysis.  
PPS includes all subjects from the FAS without protocol 
deviations, which would affect the main analysis of the 
primary  variable. 
The S afety Set (SS) will be evaluated for safety endpoints in a 
descriptive manner. SS includes all subjects who received at 
least one dose of study treatment, based on the actual treatment received.  
The Pharmaco kinetic Analysis Set (PKS) includes all 
randomized and treated subjects, for whom a PK blood sample at trough has been t
aken and who do not deviate from the 
protocol in a way that mi ght affect the evaluation of the trough 
concentrations.

 Primary variable  
The primary endpoint for the study is the change in peak VO 2 
from Baseline (Visit 2) to Week  16 (Visit 4).  
Null and alternative hypotheses  
The statistical hypothese s for the primary endpoint are  
formulated in terms of the  arithmetic  mean s (M) of the change 
in peak VO 2 in subjects treated with either placebo or 
macitentan 10  mg from Baseline (Visit  2) to Week 16 (Visit 4 ). 
H0: M macitentan 10  mg = M  placebo  versus 
HA: M macitentan 10  mg ≠ M  placebo   
The null hypothesis is tested as per primary endpoint at a 
two-sided Type I error of 1%. The study would be ‘ conclusive ’ 
at the two -sided 1% level ; it could also be declared ‘positive’ 
at a significance level of 5% on the primary endpoint. 
Primary statistical analysis  
The null hypothesis will be tested by means of an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model on the change in peak VO
2. 
Model covariates will include randomized treatment, 
geographical region, and peak  VO 2 at Baseline (Visit 2). 
For the control of type -I error a t final analysis, t he primary 
efficacy endpoint will be tested by combining the p-values from the ANCOVA of first- stage (based on actual number of 
subjects available at the time of IA)  and second -stage (based 
on the remaining number of subjects required to reach the total sample size after  IA results) , 
using the weighted 
inverse- normal combination method [ Lehmacher  1999 ] with 
fixed weights  proportional to the information available at the 
time of the IA .  
At final analysis, the difference in the change in peak VO 2 from 
Baseline to Week 16  between macitentan 10 mg and placebo 
and corresponding p- value will be estimated at each stage 
separately (first -stage and second -stage) from the main 
ANCOVA model using a population- wise splitting of data 
approach. Final interpretation of the results will then be  based 
on the final adjusted p- value, median unbiased estimator for 
the overall treatment effect and corresponding Repeated

 Confidence Intervals obtained by ADDPLAN™ 6.1 
(ADDPLAN, Inc., an Aptiv Solutions company).  
Absolute values at B aseline and at Week 16 as well as absolute 
change in peak VO 2 from Baseline to Week 16 will also be 
summarized using descriptive statistics . 
Missing values will be imputed as specified in the statistical 
section of this protocol and detailed in the SAP. 
Assumptions of normali ty of residuals and homogeneity of 
variance (assessment  of ANCOVA model assumptions ) will be  
investigated and graphically  presented when applicable 
(e.g., Q-Q and residual plots).  
Sensitivity and supportive analyses include separate extended models on the FAS with factors of NYHA FC and geographical 
region. Subgroup analyses will be conducted for adolescent subjects, adult subjects, geographical region, US subjects, non- US 
subjects, and ventricular dominance: Left ventricle  (LV)  
versus right ventricle  (RV)  / mixed . Treatment -by-subgroup 
variable interaction will be tested for heterogeneity.  
Secondary  efficacy endpoints  
If the primary endpoint is statistically significant at alpha  
significance level of α=1% two  sided  in the final analysis , the 
secondary efficacy endpoints, i.e., change from Baseline over 
52 weeks in peak VO 2 and change from B aseline to Week 16 
in mean count per minute of daily PA -Ac, will be analyzed at 
the same alpha- level as the primary endpoint using a 
hierarchical testing procedure following the order specified in the secondary endpoints [Section 
10.3.3].  
The final analysis of the secondary efficacy endpoints will be conducted using the inverse normal combination method with pre-specified weights to combine first and second stage p-
values, similar to the primary endpoint main analyses. 
The change from B aseline over 52 weeks in peak VO 2 will be  
evaluated on the FAS population by means of a  mixed model  
repeated measures (MMRM). The model will include

The family -wise Type  I error is set to 1%. The study sample 
size necessary for comparison of the primary endpoint, change in peak  VO
2 from Baseline  (Visit 2) to Week  16 (Visit 4), 
between subjects randomized in a 1:1  ratio to macitentan 
10 mg or placebo is based on the following assumptions:  
Type -I and - II errors – Power  
• A two -sided Type  I error of 1% and a Type  II error of 20% 
(80% power). 
Effect and variability assumptions   
• Assumptions are based on previous studies in subjects with Fontan- palliated circulation (TEMPO study [Hebert  2013 , 
Hebert  2014
] with bosentan and other studies, e.g., with 
bosentan, sildenafil, or iloprost): 
– A difference equal to 2.4 mL/kg/min, and 
– A standard deviation of the difference of 4.0 mL/kg/min, and 
– A normal distribution for the primary endpoint.  
Based on the above assumptions , a total of 134 subjects, 
i.e., 67 per treatment group, are required to establish 
superiority of macitentan 10  mg over placebo with 80% power 
to correctly reject the null hypothesis, when it is false, in favor of the alternative hypothesis. This test is ba sed on a two- sample 
t-test for independent samples with a two -

 PROTOCOL 
1 BACKGROUND  
1.1 Indication  
The Fontan procedure was introduced in 1968 to treat patients with tricuspid atresia. This surgical approach has subsequently been applied to a range of complex congenital heart  
malformations characterized by the presence of only one functional ventricular chamber, in patients in whom biventricular repair is not possible. The introduction of the Fontan surgical operations and their subsequent modifications brought expected survival into 
adulthood, although short -term (e.g., arrhythmia, thrombosis, etc.) and long- term 
complications (e.g., heart failure [HF ], liver, and renal failure) are as yet unavoidable and 
life expectancy is reduced. Recent stud ies in the US have found Kaplan- Meier  (KM)  
survival estimates for patients operated in the modern Fontan surgical era (from the 1990s onward) of about 96%, 90%, 80%, and 70% at 1, 10, 20 and 25 years post -Fontan operation, 
respectively  [Pundi  2015 , Dabal  2014, Khairy  2008].  
After successfully completed surgeries, Fontan -palliated patients are affected by a number 
of complications associated with considerable morbidity and mortality. Their exercise capacity (measured by peak oxygen uptake [VO
2]) remains limited , with peak VO 2 ranging 
from 48% to 65% of predicted value, and their exercise capacity decreases with time. When exercise capacity of Fontan -palliated patients falls below about 45% to 50% of peak VO
2 
predicted for age and sex [ Goldberg 2014], there is an associated increased risk of 
hospitalization or death [ Diller 2005, Diller 2010].  
[Diller 2015 ] estimated that a 40 -year old patient with Fontan physiology has a 5 -year risk 
of death (18.0%; 95% confidence interval, 11.9% to 24.6%) comparable with that of a 75-year old person from the general UK population.  Currently, there are no medicinal products approved for use in the treatment of Fontan- palliated patients.  
1.2 Study treatment  
1.2.1 Macitentan 
Macitentan (ACT -064992, Opsumit®) is an orally active, non -peptide, potent dual 
endothelin ET A and ET B receptor antagonist (ERA).  
There are several publications [ Derk  2015] on the efficacy and tolerability of endothelin 
(ET) receptor blockade in Fontan- palliated  patients, after successful surgery. A mong these 
studies, the placebo -controlled clinical study TEMPO  [Hebert  2014], was conducted in 
Denmark and Sweden with bosentan in 75 Fontan- palliated patients . Sixty -nine patients 
(30 adolescents, 39 adults) completed this study, that showed that bosentan, administered

 for 14 weeks, significantly increased peak  VO 2 and exercise duration during 
cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET), as well as improved New York Heart 
Association (NYHA) functional class (FC) , and N- terminal prohormone of brain 
natriuretic peptide (NT -proBNP ) compared to placebo. No serious adverse effects were 
seen.   
A recently published study further support s that ERAs might provide most pronounced 
hemodynamic (PVR decrease) and functional improvement (NYHA) in adults and 
adolescents.  
This small prospective cohort study conducted without a control group by  
[Agnoletti  2017],  was the first study that assessed the effects of ERA s (bosentan, 
macitentan) in patient s with a Fontan circulation with increased  pulmonary vascular 
resistance (PVR ), using cardiac catheterization and  CPET. These patients were reevaluated 
after 6 months. Pre - and post -treatment hemodynamic variables were assessed by cardiac 
catheterization.  The main study inclusion was  PVR  ≥ 2 Wood units ( WU)*m2. Functional 
capacity was evaluated by CPET. The primary endpoint was to obtain a reduction of PVR , 
while  the secondary endpoint was to obtain an improvement of functional capacity. 
A cohort of 8 adult patients with a Fontan circulation w as treated with macitentan. NYHA  
FC improved, PVR decreased and c ardiac index increased , while  CPET showed no 
significant f unctional improvement. For 8 adolescents on bosentan ( local legislative 
authority and the ethic committee allowed macitentan use only in adult patients ), NYHA  
FC improved, PVR decreased , cardiac index increased , and CPET showed significant  
functional improvement , with improvement in a naerobic threshold VO 2 and VO 2 max as 
well as o xygen pulse. 
Systolic blood pressure diminished in all adolescents (all on bosentan) and adults  (all on 
macitentan) , significantly so only for adolescents. No signi ficant differences were detected 
in diastolic blood pressure and oxygen saturation. Blood tests of hepatic and renal function were unchanged, no hepatic toxicity developed, and anemia never occurred. For detailed information on macitentan, please see the most recent version of the macitentan Investigator ’s Brochure (IB). Detailed information on ‘ Special warnings and 
precautions’ and ‘ General precautions’ are provided in sections 1.7 and 1.8 of the IB  
[Macitentan  IB].

1.3 Purpose and rationale of the study  
The purpose of the AC -055H301 study is to assess the efficacy and safety of macitentan 
10 mg once daily ( o.d.) in Fontan- palliated adult and adolescent subjects. The main goal

 of the study is to assess the benefit on exercise capacity as measured by the primary efficacy endpoint, namely  the change from baseline of peak VO
2. 
Prior randomized, placebo- controlled clinical studies performed with pulmonary 
hypertension ( PH)-specific vasodilatory medications (other than macitentan ) showed 
statistically significant benefits in Fontan -palliated adolescents and adults. T he benefit was 
measured by exercise capacity , and t hese studies also showed satisfactory safety effects. 
The Hebert  2014 study was performed in adolescents and in adults, with bosentan (an 
ERA, like macitentan) administered for 14  weeks. The Shang  2013 study was performed 
in children only, with bosentan administered for 1 year and the children  followed up for 
2 years. The Phase 1/2 range -finding study [ Goldberg 2015] administered a 
phosphodiesterase- 5 inhibitor  (udenafil) to adolescents. The Cedars  2016 cross -over study 
administered ambrisentan (another ERA) to adults only. 
In Fontan- palliated patients, the trans -pulmonary gradient corresponds to PVR in patients 
with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). High PVR index is associated with low 6-minute walk distance ( 6MWD ) and survival in children with PAH (whether idiopathic 
PAH or PAH associated with congenital heart disease [CHD]) [ Sajan  2011]. Therefore, 
macitentan, which is expected to have a beneficial effect on hemodynamics [Agnoletti  2017] as well as on vascular remodeling, may be beneficial in Fontan -palliated 
subjects through an effect that cannot be measured short- term, i.e. , during the duration of 
the proposed Phase  3 study. Macitentan is specificall y expected to provide short -to-
medium- term benefit on exercise capacity (measured by peak  VO
2), and potentially a 
longer -term effect on morbidity (effect on progressive  HF). 
The rationale for  this study is to  assess the efficacy , safety , and pharmacokineti cs (PK) of 
macitentan in Fontan- palliated adolescents and adults. 
1.4 Summary of known and potential risks and benefits  
Macitentan is approved for the treatment of PAH based on data generated in the SERAPHIN study  [Pulido  2013] . In addition, macitentan  was investigated in another CHD 
indication  (Eisenmenger Syndrome ) in the MAESTRO study [ Gatzoulis 2019 ]. Safety and 
tolerability are well documented in both indications. 
Effects on blood pressure This drug is a vasodilator. However, in the pivotal study in PAH, no difference in mean change from baseline in blood pressure (BP) was observed.  
Effect on hemoglobin  
In placebo- controlled Phase  2 and 3 studies, treatment with macitentan was associated with 
mild to moderate decreases in hemoglobin concentration, which sta bilized after the first

 few weeks of macitentan treatment. Few patients discontinued macitentan treatment due to anemia.  
Effect on liver enzymes Elevations of liver aminotransferases ( aspartate aminotransferase [ AST ], alanine 
aminotransferase [ ALT ]) have been associated with PAH and with o ther ERAs. In a 
long- term placebo -controlled trial  in PAH  [Pulido  2013] , macitentan 10  mg was not 
associated with increased incidences of treatment -emergent elevations of AST and/or ALT 
versus placebo. Based on the cumulative review of the macitentan liver cases by an 
independent liver safety data review board (ILSDRB) , there was no clear evidence of 
hepatotoxicity. Effect on edema/fluid retention  
Events of edema/fluid retention are frequent symptoms of PAH worsening and associated complications such as right ventri cular failure . Such events were  reported with similar 
incidences for macitentan and placebo patients in the pivotal placebo -controlled study in 
PAH [Pulido  2013]. Based on the observation of individual post -marketing cases where a 
causal relationship could not be excluded, and on other observations linked to the use of 
ERAs in various heart conditions, ‘ edema/fluid retention ’ was added to the undesirable 
effects section in th e Prescribing Information  of macitentan . 
Hypersensitivity reactions During post -marketing experience , hypersensitivity reactions (angioedema, pruritus, rash)  
have been reported. Pregna ncy 
Macitentan  must not be administered to a pregnant female because it may cause fetal harm. 
Women of childbearing potential will be included in the trial only if they do not intend to become pregnant during the study, are not breastfeeding, and agree  to use reliable 
contraception [ Section  4.5] from 30 days before start of treatment until one month after 
end of study drug treatment. Pregnancy tests will be performed monthly duri ng treatment 
and 1 month after stopping treatment.  
More comprehensive safety data is pro vided in the IB [ Macitentan  IB]. 
Benefit  
It is expected that macitentan treatment in Fontan- palliated patients in  NYHA FC II and III 
will positively impact exercise capacity and possibly delay disease progression.

To assess the effect of macitentan on exercise capacity (measured by peak VO 2) in 
comparison with placebo in Fontan- palliated subjects.  
2.2 Secondary objectives  
• To assess the effect of macitentan on long- term exercise capacity (measured by peak 
VO 2 over 52 weeks). 
• To assess the effect of macitentan on daily Physical Activity measured by Accelerometer  (PA-Ac). 
• To evaluate the safety and tolerability of macitentan.   
2.3 Other objectives  
• To assess the efficacy of macitentan on endpoints related to exercise capacity. 
• To assess the effect of macitentan on NT -proBNP . 
• To assess the effect of macitentan on clinical worsening.

• To assess the effect of macitentan on pharmacoeconomic endpoints. 
• To assess the plasma concentration of macitentan and its metabolite at trough.  
3 OVERALL STUDY DESIGN AND PLAN 
3.1 Study design  
This is a prospective, adaptive, multi -center, double -blind, randomi zed, 
placebo -controlled, parallel-group Phase 3 study. 
At least  134 subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either macitentan  or placebo . 
Randomization will be stratified  by geographical region (America, Europe, Asia, Oceania) . 
The study will be conducted in approximately 31 investigational sites in 11 countries. 
Given the uncertainty about both the true treatment effect and variability of the primary efficacy endpoint variable , an interim analysis (IA ) will be conducted for unblinded sample 
size re- estimation. This IA will be performed by an Independent Statistical Analysis

 Center /Statistical Support Group  (ISAC /SSG ) [see Section  3.3] for the Independent Data  
Monitoring Committee (IDMC). Only the IDMC and the ISAC /SSG  will be unblinded to 
the data. This sample size re- estimation allows the sample size to be potentially increased 
up to a total sample size of 268 subjects [see Section  10.5.3]. 
3.1.1 Study periods  
The study comprises the following consecutive periods: Screening period:  Lasts up to 30 days; starts with the signature of the informed consent 
(Visit 1) and ends with the subject’ s Randomization (Visit 2) . 
Treatment period:  Starts with the administration of the first dose of study treatment (Visit 
2) and ends on the day of the last dose of s tudy treatment , expected to be at 52 weeks. 
Subjects who prematurely and permanently discontinue study treatment before Week  52 
(Visit 6 ) must have a premature End -of-Treatment (EOT ) visit as soon as possible but not 
later than 7  days after last dose of study drug.  
Safety follow -up (S- FU) period:  
After permanent study treatment discontinuation, subjects will be followed up for a minimum of  30 days (S- FU).  
Subjects eligible to enter the AC 055H302 open- label (OL) extension study may do so as 
soon as their eligibility has been confirmed, even prior to completion of the full S -FU 
period. The period ends with administration of first study drug in the OL extension study. Post-treatment observation period (PTOP):  
Subjects who premature ly and permanently discontinue study treatment will enter the 
PTOP after their S -FU period is completed . The PTOP lasts until the planned study EOT 
(at most 52  weeks after Randomization)  for each individual subject . This last visit of the 
PTOP is called  End-of- PTOP (EOP ). The PTOP consists of an abbreviated schedule of 
assessments at 90-day intervals . 
End-of-Study (EOS):  
EOS is reached by an individual subject: 
• when the S- FU period has been completed (for those subjects who do not 
discontinue study treatment prematurely), or 
• when the S- FU period and PTOP have been completed (for those subjects who 
discontinue study treatment prematurely), or

 • if subjects enter the AC -055H302 R UBATO open-l abel (OL) extension study, with 
first administration of OL study drug.  
For all subjects, EOS corresponds to the last visit performed in this AC -055H301 
RUBATO double -blind study.  
Study Closure (SCL) will be announced by the sponsor when all subjects have reached their EOS in AC -055H301 RUBATO. 
Vital Status Follow -up (VSFU ): 
A VSFU  will be performed  within 8 weeks after the SCL  announcement to determine each 
vital status of all subjects randomized in AC -055H301 RUBATO, irrespective of whether 
the subject is included in the AC -055H302 OL extension study [see S ection 7.2.3.6] . 
Study Closure (SCL):  
The SCL applies to all randomized subjects and will occur: 
• when all subjects have had their individual VSFU, and  
• no later than 8 weeks after SCL announcement.  
The visit schedule and protocol -mandated procedures are  performed according to the table 
of assessments [ Table 2 and see Table 3 for subjects entering the PTOP], and are described 
in Section  7. 
The overall study design is depicted in Figure 1. An example of premature discontinuation 
and PTOP is depicted in Figure 2.

 3.1.2 Study duration  
The study starts with the first act of recruitment (i.e., Info rmed Consent Form [ICF] signed) 
and ends with the last visit of the last subject.  This is expected to last a pproximately 
34 months. The subjects will be treated for 52 weeks. Subjects who prematurely and permanently 
discontinue study treatment will enter a PTOP , which lasts until 52 weeks after 
randomization to monitor the medical condition of those individual subjects after stopping 
macitentan . For an individual subject, the study is completed with the EOS visit  either 
when the S -FU period has been completed (for those subjects who do not discontinue study 
treatment prematurely), or when the S -FU period and PTOP have been completed (for 
those subjects who discontinue study treatment prematurely), or if subjects enter the AC-055H302 RUBATO OL extension study, wit h first administration of OL study drug.  
At the end of the trial, when all subjects have completed their EOS, a SCL announcement 
will be made which is followed by an 8 week period within  which each vital status of all 
subjects randomized in AC- 055H301 RUBATO  will be collected , irrespective of whether 
the subject is included in the AC -055H302 OL extension study [ VSFU,  see Section 
7.2.3.6] , unless alread y known.  
This information will be collected in the eCRF after study completion.  
3.2 Study design rationale  
The study w ill assess the efficacy , safety , and PK  of treating Fontan- palliated subjects with 
macitentan compared to placebo.  As there are no approved  medications for treatment of patients with Fontan 
circulation -associated reduced exercise capacity and / or progressive HF, a 
placebo -controlled study as add-on to standard of care is ethically appropriate. 
As described in S ection  1.2.1, evidence from a study conducted with an ERA (bosentan) 
in Fontan- palliated patients indicated a clinically and statistically significant beneficial 
impact o n exercise capacity at W eek 14 [ Hebert  2014 ]. Considering past experience on 
time to maximal effect of macitentan on exercise capacity in patients with PAH (in the SERAPHIN  study, 10 mg macitentan given o.d. improved the functional capacity of adult 
patients with PAH, as measured by the 6MWD test at 3  months [AC -055- 302 SERAPHIN, 
post-hoc analysis, data on file] and at 6  months [ Pulido 2013] ), a time point of 16 weeks 
was chosen for assessing the primary endpoint.  A recent study administering bosentan in adolescents and macitentan in Fontan- palliated 
adults [ Agnoletti  2017] further support s that ERAs might provide most pronounced 
hemodynamic (PVR decrease) and functional improvement (NYHA) in adults and adolescents.

 Very limited evidence on long- term follow up of treatment of Fo ntan- palliated patients 
with PH -specific vasodilators is available. In the [ Shang  2013]  study, Fontan- palliated 
children were treated for 1  year and followed up for 2 years. Considering the 
recommendation of at least a yearly follow -up of Fontan- palliated patients, a 1- year study 
duration was defined. Additional assessments of peak VO 2 in this time frame will help to 
understand the dynamics of the impact on exercise capacity and possibly disease progression.  
3.3 Study committees  
An IDMC has overall responsibility for safeguarding the interests of subjects by monitoring safety and efficacy data obtained in the study and making appropriate recommendations based on the reported data, thus ensuring that the study is being conducted with the highest scientific and ethical standards. The IDMC will be fully operational prior to enrol lment of the first subject into the study  and is supported by an 
Independent S tatistical Analysis Center /Statistical Support Group  (ISAC /SSG ). The 
composition and operation of the IDMC are described in the IDMC charter.  
In addition, the IDMC will review the report of the IA provided by the ISAC /SSG  and 
provide a recommendation to the Sponsor Committee on potential sample size adjustments 
following rules described in the IDMC charter.  
An ILSDRB  (an external expert committee of hepatologists) has been appointed to monitor 
all Actelion studies with macitenta n, as well as post -marketing cases,  and to provide 
ongoing assessment and advice regarding serious hepatic adverse events ( AEs) of special 
interest during the study as per the ILSDRB charter . 
4 SUBJECT POPULATION 
4.1 Subject population description  
This study will enroll adolescent and adult male and female subjects aged 12  years and 
older, with either Lateral Tunnel T otal Cavopulmonary Connection (LT- TCPC), or E xtra 
Cardiac Tunnel T otal Cavopulmonary Connection (EC -TCPC) . 
They must be in NYHA FC II or I II (confirmed by the investigator with the Specific 
Activity Scale) [ Appendix 4] and be able and willing to perform CPET (confirmed by the 
ability to reach a respiratory exchange ratio of 1.1, based on historical and/or baseline CPET) . 
Women of childbearing potential must not be pregnant , breastfeeding , or hav e the intention 
of becoming pregnant during the study and agree to use reliable contraception throughout 
the study.

 Eligible subjects  and/or legal representatives must be able and willing to give informed 
consent/ assent for participation in the clinical study.  
Treatment with ERAs is  not permitted. 
4.2 Rationale for the selection of the study population  
LT-TCPC and EC -TCPC Fontan- palliated patients constitute the majority of present -day 
Fontan- palliated patients and are considered to constitute a homogeneous group in terms 
of prognosis. The medical need in Fontan- palliated patients with NYHA FC  II and III is 
greater than in patients with milder disease (FC  I), as higher FC is both an indicator of 
decreased exercise tolerance and progression of their HF . FC IV patients are considered 
too severe,  heterogeneous, and a re likely to be late failing -Fontan patients with overt 
clinical signs of HF and/or other signs of Fontan- related serious complications. 
Furthermore, the only true treatment of FC  IV Fontan- palliated patients is heart 
transplantation . Failing -Fontan patients are not planned to be included in this study. 
The LT-TCPC and EC -TCPC Fontan- palliated surviving patient population is a relatively 
young population in which medical need is high because their exercise capacity is 
significantly red uced. In this population, patie nts are expected to derive a significant 
beneficial effect on their exercise capacity  and, potentially, disease progression can be 
delayed. Within this population, adolescents have the greatest need for improvement of their e xercise capacity as they are at an age where their exercise intolerance progresses the 
most rapidly [ Giardini  2008, Kempny  2012, Fernandes  2010 ]. 
4.3 Inclusion criteria  
For inclusion in the study, all of the following inclusion criteria must be fulfilled. It is not permitted to waive any of the criteria for any subject:  
1. Written informed consent/assent from the subject and/or a legal representative prior to initiation of any study- mandated procedures.  
2. Male or female ≥ 12 years old.  
3. Fontan- palliated subjects with either LT-TCPC, or EC-TCPC  surgery > 1 year before 
Screening. LT-TCPC, or EC-TCPC surgery  can be primary or secondary to 
atrio-pulmonary connection.  
4. NYHA FC II or III (assessed by the investigator using the Specific Activity Scale 
[Appendix 4 ]).  
5. Ability to understand and comply with the instructions , and ability to physically 
perform the CPET.

4.5 Criteria for women of childbearing potential  
4.5.1 Definition of childbearing potential  
A woman is considered to be of childbearing potential unless she meets at least one of the 
following criteria:  
• Previous bilateral salpingectomy, bilateral salpin go-oophorectomy or hysterectomy, 
• Postmenopausal (defined as 12 consecutive months with no menses without an alternative med ical cause [ICH  M3 definition]),  
• Premature ovarian failure (confirmed by a specialist), XY genotype, Turner syndrome, uterine agenesis, 
• Pre-pubescence ( pre-pubescent females must have their childbearing potential status 
reassessed  at each visit and recorded in the electronic Case Report Form [eCRF] ). 
To determine pre -pubescent status of female subjects who have not reached menarche, the 
subject will do a self -assessment  in the presence of the investigator (or female counselor

 when applicable)  according to the Tanner stages described in Appendix 5. The onset of 
puberty is defined as reaching stage 2 on the Tanner scale. 
The site study personnel will record the Tanner stage and the childbearing potential in the eCRF. Once childbearing potential is achieved, the Tanner stage will no longer be self-
assessed. For abstinent subjects of childbearing potential , the study personnel will ask at 
each visit whether the subject currently is or might  become sexually active. If confirmed 
the study personnel will counsel the female on the appropriate methods of contraception as 
applicable [see to Section  4.5.2] . 
The reason for not being of childbearing potential will be recorded in the e CRF.  
4.5.2 Acceptable methods of contraception  
Women of childbearing potential [ see definition in Section  4.5.1]  must use acceptable birth 
control from Screening up to at least 30  days after study treatment discontinuation . Reliable 
contraception must be started at least 30  days prior to Visit 2. 
The methods of birth control used (including non- pharmacological methods) must be 
recorded in the eCRF.  
To ensure compliance, the study personnel must remind women of childbearing potential at each visit to use the methods of contraception defined for this study. The reminders must 
be documented in the hospital chart.  If subjects decide that they want to change the form of birth control being used, they need to talk with the treating physician to be sure that another acceptable form of birth control is chosen.  4.5.2.1 Countries  having taken part in the VHP ( Voluntary Harmonization 
Procedure) , or countries with a restricted list of contraception methods  
Study treatment should only  be initiated in women of child bearing potential when the 
absence of pregnancy has been verified, appropriate advice on contraception provided, and reliable contraception is practiced.  It must be ensured that a female counselor is available 
to discuss this  topic, if requested.  
In countries having taken part in the VHP , namely Denmark, Germany and UK ,  
one of the following highly effective contraception methods is required : 
• combined (estrogen  and progestogen- containing) hormonal contraception associated 
with inhibition of ovulation:  
− oral 
− intravaginal

4.5.2.2 Countries not having taken part in  the VHP  (excluding France) or countries 
without  a restricted list of contraception methods 
In the Czech Republic, Poland and Ireland, study treatment should only  be initiated in 
women of childbearing potential when the absence of pregnancy has been verified, appropriate advice on contraception provided, and reliable contra ception is practiced.  It 
must be ensured that a female counselor is available to discuss this topic, if requested.  True abstinence from intercourse with a male partner, only when this is in line with the preferred lifestyle of the subject, is considered a n acceptable birth control method.

5 TREATMENTS  
5.1 Study treatment  
5.1.1 Investigational treatment: Description and rationale  
Macitentan 10  mg will be provided as film- coated tablets debossed with ‘10’ on one side, 
for o.d. oral administration  with or without food.  
Inactive ingredients of the macitentan tablet formulation are the following: lactose, magnesium stearate, microcrystalline cellulose, povidone, sodium starch glycolate type A, polysorbate. The film coat contains t itanium dioxide, talc, xanthan gum, polyvinyl alcohol , 
and soy lecithin. The macitentan 10  mg o.d. dose selected for the proposed study is based on the formulation 
and the dose regimen approved for treatment of adult patients with PAH from World Health 
Organization (WHO) FC II and III. Treatment with another related ERA, bosentan, has 
shown efficacy and safety in Fontan -palliated adolescent and adults with the dose regimen 
approved for PAH [ Hebert  2014]  and dose adjusted on body weight [ Shang 2013 ]. 
5.1.2 Comparator: Description and rationale  
The t reatment comparator will be matching placebo tablets, for o.d. oral administration  
with or without food .  
As no approved medicinal treatment for patients with Fontan- palliation exists and the 
disease progression is rather slow, it is ethical to compare the investigational medic inal 
product to placebo as add on to standard of care.  
5.1.3 Study treatment administration  
If the subject is eligible, the first intake of study treatment will take place at site, during the Randomization visit (Visit 2), after successful completion of all Scre ening (Visit  1) and 
Randomization (Visit 2) assessments.  
The subjects must be instructed not to take study treatment in the morning of study visit days.

 On the days of study visits, the dose of the study treatment should be withheld until all assessments h ave been performed. Study treatment will then be administered from the 
newly dispensed batch. 
If a dose is missed, it should not be taken as compensation the following day, but instead 
the subject should continue with the regular dosing. The interruption should be noted in the 
eCRF.  
For this study, any dose of study treatment higher than the planned total daily dose in a single day will be considered an overdose [see Sections  9.1 and 9.6].  
In the event of an overdose, standard supportive measures must be taken, as required.

5.1.4 Treatment assignment  
After having verified that the subject meets all inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria, the investigator/delegate contacts the interactive response technology ( IRT)  
system  at Visit 2 to randomize the subject. The IRT assigns a randomization  number to the 
subject and assigns the treatment kit number , which matches the treatment arm assigned 
by the randomization list to the randomization number.  
Subjects are assigned to the two treatment arms in a 1:1 ratio based on a permutated -block 
randomiz ation stratified by the geographical region (America, Europe, Asia, Oceania ) in 
order to balance treatment arms throughout the conduct of the trial.  
The randomization list is generated by an independent Contract Research Organization  
(CRO), Almac Clinical Technologies, using SAS
® v9.3. 
5.1.5 Blinding  
This study will be performed in a double -blind fashion. The investigator and study 
personnel, the subjects, the  clinical research as sociates ( CRAs ), Actelion personnel, and

 CRO personnel involved in the conduct of the study will remain blinded to the study treatment until study completion [see Section 8.1]. Actelion personnel responsi ble for 
clinical study supply distribution will need to be unblinded to ensure adequate supply of study treatment. These persons will be clearly identified, their unblinding will be documented in the trial master file and they will not take part in any cli nical trial tea m 
(CTT) meetings after study set -up has been completed. 
Until the time of unblinding for final data analysis, the randomization list is kept strictly confidential and accessible only to authorized persons, e.g., Global Quality Management 
(GQM), and the ISAC/SSG , who are not involved in the conduct of the study. 
The investigational treatment and its matching placebo are indistinguishable , and all 
treatment kits will be packaged in the same way.  
5.1.6 Unblinding  
5.1.6.1 Unblinding for final analyses  
Full randomization information will be made available for data analysis only after database closure, in accordance with Actelion Quality System (QS) documents. 
5.1.6.2 Unblinding for IDMC  
The ISAC /SSG  not otherwise involved in the design, conduct and analysis of the study, 
will have access to the randomization code in order to prepare unblinded reports  and IA 
results for review by the IDMC, as described in the IDMC charter. The randomization code 
will be made available  only to the ISAC /SSG  in accordance with Actelion ’s qua lity 
documents. 5.1.6.3 Unblinding for suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction s 
If a suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction ( SUSAR ) occurs for a subject 
participating in the study, the sponsor  will request the unblinding of the treatment 
assignment. The treatment assignment will not be communicated to site personnel or to the Actelion  personnel . Unblinded SUSAR information will be provided to respective health 
authorities and independent ethics  committees (IECs) or institutional review board s (IRBs ) 
only. SUSARs will be reported to investigators in a blinded fashion. 5.1.6.4 Emergency procedure for unblinding  
The investigator, study personnel and Actelion personnel must remain blinded to the subject’ s treatment assignment. The identity of the study treatment may be revealed only 
if the subject experiences a medical event, the management of which would require knowledge of the blinded treatment assignment. In this case, the investigator can receive the unblinded treatment assignment through the IRT. In these situations, the decision to unblind resides solely with the investigator. Whenever it is possible, and if it does not

 interfere with (or does not delay) any decision in the best interest of the subject, the investigator is invited to discuss the intended unblinding with Actelion personnel.  
The occurrence of any unblinding during the study must be clearly justified and explained by the investigator. In all cases, Actelion personnel must be informed as soon as possible before or after the unblinding. A subject may stay on study treatment after unblinding provided the following conditions are met:  
• The treating physician believes that the benefit/risk balance remains favorable . 
• Unblinding was not due to an intentional overdose of study drug. 
Unblinding will not be allowed for the sole purpose of entering the AC-055H302 OL 
extension. The circumstances leading to unblinding must be documented in the Investigator Site File (ISF) and e CRF.  
5.1.7 Study treatment supply  
Manufacture, labeling, packaging, and supply of study treatment will be  conducted 
according to Good Manufacturing Practice, Good Clinical Practice (GCP ), and any local 
or national regulatory requirements . 
All study treatment supplies are to be used only in accordance with this protocol, and not for any other purpose. 5.1.7.1 Study treatment packaging and labeling 
Study treatment is provided as tablets and supplied in childproof bottles  containing 
36 tablets . 
Study treatment is labeled to comply with the applicable laws and regulations of the countries in which the study sites are located. Each medication bottle has a booklet affixed, 
detailing all relevant information. The booklet contains a tear -off part specifying the study 
protocol number, the packaging batch number and the bottle number. When the study treatment is given to the subject, the investigator, pharmacist (if applicable), or designee 
must remove the tear- off part and attach it to the  Investigational Medicinal Product ( IMP) 
Label Dispensing Log. 5.1.7.2 Study treatment distribution and storage  
The investigator is responsible for safe and proper handling and storage of the study treatment at the investigational site and for ensuring that the study treatment is administered only to subjects enrolled in the study and in accordance with the protocol.

 5.1.7.2.1 Study treatment distribution 
The study centers will be supplied with study treatment according to the centers ’ needs, 
depending on the rate of subject enrollment. Each center will have an individual stock of study treatment, which will be re -supplied continuously as soon as a predefined minimum 
level of study treatment has been reached.  5.1.7.2.2 Study treatment storage 
Study treatment must be kept in a locked room or a locked cupboard in a restricted access room, which can be accessed only by the pharmacist, the investigator, or another duly designated person as specified on the delegation of authority form.  The subject must be educated on the proper study treatment storage conditions at home.  Bottles containing study treatment tablets must be stored according to conditions specified 
on the label . Refer to the pharmacy manual/study site investigational product and 
procedures manual for additional guidance on study treatment  handling and storage. 
5.1.7.3 Study treatment dispensing  
The subjects will receive sufficient study treatment to cover the period up to the next scheduled visit. Subjects are asked to return all used and unused study treatment (including empty bottles ) at each vis it. The protocol -mandated study- treatment dispensing procedures 
may not be altered without prior written approval from Actelion.  An accurate record of the 
date and amount of study treatment dispensed /returned  to/by each subject must be availab le 
for inspection at any time.   
Once a subject has been enrolled and study treatment assigned, the corresponding bottles/packs must not be used for another subject. If a subject has been dispensed a bottle/pack in error (one that has not been allocated yet to another subject), the IRT system helpdesk must immediately be contacted.  
At the time study treatment is dispensed, the subject should be educated on the proper storage conditions at home [see Section  5.1.7.2.2] .  
5.1.7.4 Study treatment return and destruction  
The protocol -mandated study treatment return procedures may not be altered without prior 
written approval from Actelion. On an ongoing basis (if required) or on termination of the 
study at site level , the CRA will collect used and unused treatment kits, which will be sent 
to the warehouse, where Actelion personnel or a deputy will check treatment reconciliation. In certain circumstances, used and unused study treatment containers may be destroyed at the site once study treatment accountability is finalized and has been checked by Actelion personnel or the deputy, and written permission for destruction has been obtained from Actelion.

 In case study treatment cannot be reconciled by the CRA before destruction, a note to file is written  by the study team. 
5.1.8 Study treatment accountability and compliance with study treatment  
5.1.8.1 Study treatment accountability  
The inventory of study treatment dispensed to and returned by the subject (i.e., study- treatment accountability) must be performed by site personnel on the day of the 
visit and before dispensing further study treatment. It is to be recorded by site personnel on 
the Study- Treatment Account ability and Compliance Log and in the eCRF and checked by 
the CRA during the monitoring visits and once each individual subject has terminated the study. The study treatment accountability log in the e CRF will include at least the following 
information for  each study treatment unit (i.e ., bottle)  dispensed to the subject: 
• Allocated bottle number (pre-populated in the eCRF) 
• Dispensed bottles number  
• Date dispensed / number of tablets dispensed  
• Date returned / number of tablets  returned  
All study treatment sup plies, including unused, partially used, or empty bottles must be 
retained at the site for review by the CRA.  
If the subject forgets to bring the remaining study treatment to a study visit, he/she must be instructed to not take any tablets from the remaining study treatment bottle and to return it at the next visit.  
5.1.8.2 Study treatment compliance 
Study treatment compliance  must be evaluated by the site staff prior to each new 
dispensation. It  is based on study treatment accountability. Study treatment compliance 
will be calculated by site personnel at each visit  when the IMP is returned and new IMP 
dispensed , using the below formula , and entered in the e CRF:  
Compliance = [(number of tablets dispensed − number of tablets  returned) / Total number 
of tablets  that should have been taken since the last visit
*] × 100. 
* The number of tablets that should have been taken  since the last visit is derived from the 
number of planned treatment days  between  the previous visit  and the day before the current 
visit. It is defined as current visit date −  previous visit date .  
Between visits, compliance is expected to be between 80% and 120%. Compliance values outside of this range will be considered as a protocol deviation, which will be reported in 
the e CRF by the CRA.  Permanent discontinuation of study treatment may be considered 
after consultation with Actelion.

 5.1.9 Study treatment dose adjustments and interruptions  
Study treatment dose adjustments are not permitted. Study treatment  may be temporarily interrupted in response to an AE, a diagnostic or 
therapeutic procedure, a laboratory abnormality, or for administrative reasons. Study- specific criteria for interruption of study treatment are described in Section  5.1.11. 
If study treatment is interrupted by the subject for any reason, she/he must immediately inform the investigator.  
Interruptions of study treatment must be kept as short as possible. If treatment is stopped for more than 4 consecutive weeks, re- introduction is not permitted , and treatment must be 
permanently discontinued [see Section  5.1.10].  
Study treatment interruptions as well as reasons for interruptions must be recorded in the eCRF.  
5.1.10 Premature discontinuation of study treatment  
The decision to prematurely discontinue study treatment may be made by the subject, the investigator, or Actelion personnel. The main reason and whether discontinuation of study treatment is the decision of the subject (e.g., AE  or lack of efficacy), the investigator (e.g., 
due to pre -specified study treatment discontinuation criteria, an AE or lack of efficacy), or 
Actelion (e.g., study termination) must be documented in the e CRF.  
A subject has the right to prematurely discontinue study tre atment at any time, without any 
justification , by withdrawal from study treatment only , or by withdrawal from any further 
participation in the study , including the VS FU (i.e., premature withdrawal from the study  
[see Section  8.2]). Although a subject is not obliged to give his/her reason for prematurely 
withdrawing from the treatment or the study, it is recommended that the investigator makes a reasonable effort to ascertain the reason(s), while fully respecting the subject ’s rights.  
The investigator must discontinue study treatment for a given subject if, on balance, he/she believes that continued administration would be contrary to the best interests of the subject.  
Study- specific criteria for discontinuation of study treatment are described in 
Section  5.1.11. 
A subject who prematurely discontinues study treat ment is NOT  considered as withdrawn 
from the study and will be followed up until at least the S -FU visit and, if applicable, during 
the PTOP until Week  52, as well as for  collection of vital status at SCL , provided that the 
subject’ s consent for this limit ed participation in the study has not been withdrawn. 
The subject will be asked to return for an EOT visit within 7 days of last intake of study 
treatment and assessed for a S- FU visit 30 days after the last intake of study treatment. If

 the subject enters the PTOP, the subject will be called on the tele phone for follow -up visits 
as described in  Table 3. The assessments that are performed at each visit  are described in 
Table 3 [see Section  7.1]. Importantly, if discontinuation occurs prior to the Week  16 
CPET assessment for  the primary endpoint, it is requested that the subject return s to the 
site at Week  16 for a CPET evaluation. 
A subject who prematurely discontinues study treatment and withdraws consent to participate in any further study assessments is considered as withdrawn from the study. Subjects who die or are lost to follow -up are also considered as withdrawn from the study. 
Withdrawal from the study and follow -up medical care of subjects withdrawn from the 
study is described in Sections 8.2 and 8.4, respectively. 
5.1.11 Study -specific criteria for interruption / premature discontinuation of study 
treatment  
Study treatment interruptions exceeding 4 consecutive weeks must lead to permanent discontinuation of study treatment. 5.1.11.1 Pregnancy  
If a female subject becomes pregnant while on study treatment, study treatment must  be 
interrupted immediately, and a Pregnancy Notification Form must be completed [see 
Section  9.3.1].   
5.1.11.2 Liver aminotransferase abnormalities 
Interruption of study treatment 
Study treatment must be interrupted in the following cases:  
• Aminotransferases (i.e., ALT and/or AST) ≥ 3 and <  8 × upper limit of normal (ULN) 
 A re-test of aminotransferases (ALT and AST), total and direct bilirubin, and alkaline 
phosphatase (AP) must be performed within one  week. If AST and/or ALT elevation is 
confirmed, aminotransferases, total and direct bilirubin, and AP levels must be monitored 
weekly until values return to pre -treatment levels or within normal ranges. If the 
aminotransferase values return to pre -treatment levels or within normal ranges, 
re-introduction of study treatment can be considered.  
Re-introduction of study treatment after treatment interruption should only be considered 
if the potential benefits of study treatment outweigh the potential risks and when liver aminotransferase values are within pre -treatment levels or within normal ranges. The 
advice of a hepatologist is recommended.  
Liver aminotransferase levels must then be checked within 3  days after re -introduction, 
then again after a further 2 weeks and thereafter according to the recommendations above (e.g., at monthly intervals).

 Permanent discontinuation of study treatment 
Study treatment must be stopped, and its re -introduction is not to be considered in the 
following cases:  
• Aminotransferases ( ALT and/or AST) ≥  8 × ULN 
• Aminotran sferases ( ALT and/or AST) ≥ 3 × ULN and associated clinical symptoms of 
liver injury, e.g., nausea, vomiting, fever, abdominal pain, jaundice, unusual lethargy or fatigue, flu- like syndrome (arthralgia, myalgia, fever)  
• Aminotransferases ( ALT and/or AST) ≥ 3 × ULN and associated increase in total 
bilirubin ≥  2 × ULN  
 A re-test of aminotransferases (ALT and AST), total and direct bilirubin, and AP  must be 
performed . Aminotransferases, total and direct bilirubin, and AP levels must be monitored 
weekly after study treatment discontinuation until values return to pre -treatment levels or 
within normal ranges. Other diagnoses (e.g., viral hepatitis, mononucleosis, toxoplasmosis, cytomegalovirus, alcoholic hepatitis, non- alcoholic steatohepatitis, autoimmune  disease) and/or etiologies 
(e.g., hepatic toxicity of concomitant medication[s] or other substances) should be considered and ruled out by performing the appropriate tests. All liver aminotransferases abnormalities leading to study treatment interruption or discontinuation must be recorded as AEs [see Section  9].  
To ensure the proper and comprehensive evaluation of cases of ALT and/or AST 
increase >  3 × ULN, additional subject data may be collected in the hepatic event 
questionnaire distributed by the sponsor. An independent ILSDRB (an external  expert committee of hepatologists ) provides ongoing 
assessment s and advice regarding any hepatic events th at may require further evaluation  
during the study.  5.1.11.3 Hemoglobin abnormalities 
If there is a case of hemoglobin  < 100 g/L accompanied by a change from baseline
4 of 
≥ 50 g/L during the treatment period (up to and including Visit  7), or a blood transfusion , 
a re-test must be performed within 10  days of the initial test showing the decrease, with 
additional laboratory evaluations that may include, but are not limited to, any of the following:  
 
 
4 Baseline hemoglobin refers to the last hemoglobin value obtained prior to first intake of study treatment.

 • Red blood cell cellular indices (mean corpuscular volume, mean corpuscular hemoglobin, mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration), peripheral blood smear, reticulocyte count, iron status (iron level, serum ferritin, total iron binding capacity, transferrin saturation), lactate dehydrogenase, indirect bilirubin . 
Study treatment must be temporarily interrupted if clinically mandated based on the investigator’s judgment. Any hemoglobin decrease equivalent to CTCAE version 4.03 grade 3 or higher  
(i.e., hemoglobin < 8.0 g/dL; <  4.9 mmol/L; <  80 g/L) should result in interruption of study 
medication, unless an underlying blood loss event caused this decrease. Re-introduction of study treatment may be considered by the investigator if hemoglobin 
recovery, defined as a return of hemoglobin above the lower limit of the normal range or to baseline, is achieved.  
5.1.11.4 Drop in BP  
BP is measured at each visit and at regular intervals during the conduct of CPET. Study 
treatment must be temporarily  interrupted  if systolic BP  drops to < 90 mmHg (<  85 mmHg 
for subjects < 18 years old and < 150 cm  of height). 
Re-introduction of study treatment after treatment interruption should only be considered 
if the potential benefits of study treatment outweigh the potential risks and when BP  values 
are within pre -treatment levels or wit hin normal ranges.  
BP must then be checked within 3 days after re- introduction, then again after a further 
2 weeks and thereafter according to the recommendations of the treating physician.  These 
checks need not  occur at the study site and results may be communicated to the site via 
phone. 5.1.11.5 Initiation of forbidden medication  
Study treatment  must be permanently discontinued if any forbidden medications are  started 
during the treatment period . 
However, i f subjects are currently stable on a moderate dual CYP3A4/CYP2C9 inhibitors 
(e.g., fluconazole, amiodarone) or co- administration of a combination of moderate 
CYP3A4 (e.g., ciprofloxacin, cyclosporine, diltiazem, erythromycin, verapamil) and 
moderate CYP2C9 inhibitors (e.g., miconazole, piperine), the subje ct may remain on 
current treatment per the investigator ’s discretion based on his/her clinical judgement and 
risk-benefit assessment. However, the subject will not be eligible to enter the OL study 
unless the forbidden medication is discontinued 1 month pr ior to OL enrollment.

7 VISIT SCHEDULE AND STUDY ASSESSMENTS 
7.1 General information  
The study visits are listed in  Table 2  (and Table 3 for PTOP) . For all visits, the subjects 
must be seen on the designated (calendar) day with an allowed visit window of ±  7 days. 
A visit may occur over more than one day. A follow -up safety visit (S-FU) must be 
performed at earliest 30 days , but not later than 35 days, after intake of the last dose of 
study treatment. The assessments pertaining to a visit may be performed within the allowed time window. In addition, unschedule d visits can occur at any time [Section  7.1.2]. 
In case of premature discontinuation of study treatment, the EOT visit must take place as soon as possible and no later than 7 days after the last dose of study treatment. Subjects who prematurely discontinue study treatment for any reason will not be replaced. 7.1.1 Screening/re- screening  
Screening starts with the signature of the informed consent. The date on which the first screening assessment is perfo rmed corresponds to the date of the Screening visit. 
It is the responsibility of the investigator/delegate to obtain written informed consent from each subject participating in this study after adequate face -to-face explanation of the 
objectives, methods, and potential hazards of the study. The subjects (and if applicable 
their legal representative) who agree to participate in the study and the investigator/delegate must sign the ICF  (and if applicable assent form)  prior to any 
study- related assessment or p rocedure. 
Subjects who have signed informed consent and  are in screening when the enrollment 
target has been met may still be randomized  if they meet all the selection criteria .

 It is permitted to re -screen subjects once, if the reason for non-e ligibility was transient 
(e.g., abnormal laboratory test, insufficient wash -out period of a forbidden medication). In 
this case, re -consent is required  if the initial consent signature is more than 30  days old or 
if a new informed consent version is available.  
All screening assessments should be repeated at the time of re- screening.  The PA -Ac is 
mandatory at re -screening.  
7.1.2 Unscheduled visits  
Unscheduled visits may be performed at any time during the study. Depending on the reason for the unscheduled visit (e.g., AE), appropriate assessments will be performed based on the judgment of the investigator , and the results will be recorded in the eCRF. 
After an unscheduled visit, the regular scheduled study visits must continue according to the planned visit and assessment schedule.

 7.2 Study assessments 
The study assessments are listed in  Table 2. The assessments that are mandatory during a 
visit are marked with an ‘X’ . Optional assessments (during unscheduled visits) are marked 
with an ‘ X’. 
An evaluation of how these assessments rela te to standard of care is found in Appendix 6. 
All study assessments are performed  by qualified study personnel (medical, nursing, or 
specialist technical personnel) a nd are recorded in the eCRF, unless otherwise specified. If 
an assessment does not produce evaluable results, the treating physician may decide to repeat the assessment during the study visit, or at an unscheduled visit. Study assessments performed during unscheduled visits will also be recorded in the e CRF. When applicable, 
the following order of assessments is recommended:  
1. Quality of life questionnaires  (CGI -C, CGI -S, EQ -5D- 5L, PGI -C, PGA- S) 
2. Physical examination, vital signs and echocardiography 
3. Electrocardiogram  (ECG ) / CPET  
4. Blood sampling (including PK), pregnancy test. 
If the principal investigator ( PI) delegates any study procedure/assessment for a subject, 
e.g., CPET, echocardiography, blood sampling [ see Section  7.2.4.1], to an external facility, 
he/she should inform Actelion to whom these tasks are delegated. The set- up and oversight 
will be agreed upon with Actelion. The supervision of any external facilities remains the 
responsibility of the PI.   
Any incidental finding of an abnormality discovered by this external facility must be shared with the PI who is responsible for reporting the event (e.g., AE) in the eCRF as appropriate. 
Clinically relevant incidental findings will be followed up per local medical practice.  
Calibration certificates  / evidence of equipment maintenance  or calibration  for the 
below- listed equipment used to perform study assess ments must be available prior to the 
screening of the first subject.  
• Temperature  measurement devices for study treatment storage area and freezer . 
• CPET equipment (metabolic cart including ECG device, ergometer). 
 Evidence of equipment calibration must be present in the ISF .

 7.2.1 Demographics / baseline characteristics  
Demographic and baseline characteristic data to be collected on all randomized subjects 
include: a ge, sex, race and ethnicity12, body weight, height, NYHA FC (assessed using the 
Specific Activity Scale), as well as the reason why a woman is not considered to be of  
childbearing potential (if applicable). Relevant medical history  / current medical conditions  
based on investigator’s judgment (e.g., chronic and ongoing acute conditions, serious past conditions) present before and/or at the time of signing informed consent will be recorded 
on the medical history page. These include the original congenital heart defect leading to Fontan- palliation, concomitant procedures (e.g., Norwood, Glenn, fenestration), type of 
current TCPC (LT- or EC -TCPC ), and whether TCPC is primary or secondary (conversion 
from another Fontan -palliated type), in addition to the date of Fontan surgery completion. 
Where po ssible, diagnoses and not symptoms will be recorded. 
For subjects who failed screening, the following data will be recorded in the eCRF if 
available:  
• Age, sex, race and ethnicity
14  
• Reason for screen failure ; 
− subject not eligible as per inclusion/exclusion  criteria , 
− subject withdrew consent , 
− other (specify), e.g., concomitant medication related to inclusion/exclusion criteria . 
7.2.2 Efficacy assessmen ts 
7.2.2.1 Cardiopulmonary exercise testing  
CPET will be conducted at study sites for Visits  1 (training CPET  during Screening), 
2 (Randomization), 4 (Week  16), and 6 (Week  52).  
Furthermore, if a subject discontinues treatment prematurely, a CPET will be conducted within 7  days of EOT. If treatment  is discontinued prior to Visit 4 (Week  16), and the 
subject enters the PTOP, it is requested that the subject return s for a CPET assessment at 
Week  16. 
A CPET test will be conducted during the screening period. R esults of the training CPET 
are captured in  the eCRF.  
Detailed guidelines on correct execution of the test, the Actelion CPET guidelines , are 
provided in Appendix 3. Additional information is provided in  the central reading facility ’s 
 
 
12 For countries that do not allow the collection of race/ethnicity, ensure that 1) the ICF makes the collection of race 
possible in these countries; or 2) race/ethnicity will be collected in the e CRF only where it is allowed.

training log must be collected upon completion of the training.  For each individual subject, 
the CP ET should be conducted under the same conditions throughout the study 
(e.g., same device, about the same time of the day, etc.).  
Variables that are assessed include VO 2, VCO 2, heart rate (HR), an d VE.  
Basic spirometry to determine breathing reserve will also be part of the CPET procedure. Spirometry testing will be performed according to recommendations from the American 
Thoracic Society / European Respiratory Society guidelines [ Miller  2005a , Miller  2005b].  
Breathing reserve (BR)  is calculated from estimating maximal voluntary ventilation 
(MVV) b y assessing the forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) × 40, as well as 
the peak VE using the following formula. BR% = ( [MVV - VE ]/MVV) × 100 
Peak  VO
2 (highest volume of oxygen taken up per kg and minute) is assessed during CPET 
via metabolic cart ( breath -by-breath analysis) and calculated as the highest value reached 
over a 30-second interval [ Guazzi  2012 , Guazzi  2016a , Guazzi  2016b].  
The % predicted value for peak VO 2 is calculated according to the Wasserman -Hansen 
equation s [Wasserman  2005, Guazzi  2012], using age, height , and weight at the time of 
the test.  
The respiratory exchange ratio (RER) defined as VCO 2/VO 2 is an indication of good 
exercise effort and achieving a value of 1.1 is expected for validating the primary endpoint and reaching exhaustion. Ventilatory efficie ncy is define d as VE/VCO
2 slope (from the beginning of exercise to 
maximal effort), and oxygen pulse, a surrogate of stroke volume, as VO 2/HR.  
VO 2 at VAT  is determined using the modified V -slope method. The OUES is derived from  
the relationship between VO 2 and the log transformation of VE [ Guazzi  2016a ]. 
Validity of CPET will be confirmed by the site staff in the eCRF and the raw data will be made available to the central reading facility . Re-evaluation of the results based on raw 
data will be done in a blinded fashion. Data is then provided to Actelion. Inclusion will be based on CPET data collected at B aseline and on interpretation of 
peak  VO
2, RER and BR by the CPET site staff. Th ese values will be captured in the eCRF.  
Furthermore, the baseline resting VO 2 will be ca ptured in the eCRF.

 Any incidental finding of an abnormality discovered by this external facility must be shared with the PI who is responsible for reporting the event (e.g., AE) in the eCRF as appropriate.  
Clinically relevant incidental findings will be followed up per local medical practice. 7.2.2.2 PA-Ac 
The daily physical activity (counts/min) of the subject is assessed via accelerometer  during 
daytime . The accelerometer is given to the subject at Visit 1 ( Screening visit), and data is 
collected  for 9  consecutive daily daytime periods  after Visit 1, Visit  4 (Week  16), and 
before Visit 6 (Week  52). To establish a sufficient baseline, Visit
 2 will have to occur 
≥ 9 days after Visit 1. The duration of physical activity  data collection  will allow including 
data during week days and weekend days and will provide a reliable estimate of the usual physical activity of the subject. Only data collected during these 9-day periods will be used 
for the analysis of physical activity.  
The investigator (or delegate) ins tructs subjects on how and when to wear the 
accelerometer (refer to the RUBATO Accelerometry Manual ). The accelerometer is worn 
during waking hours of the subject  and may be worn  during activities when the device 
could get wet ( except swimming). Subjects w ill receive a reminder from the site staff 
(e.g., telephone call, text message) to ensure that they are wearing the accelerometer during these periods. The accelerometers are pre- programmed to minimize patient handling and 
do not display the collected data . The subjects return the device to the study site and the 
investigator (or delegate) transfers the data to the accelerometry central reading facility  as 
described in the RUBATO Accelerometry Manual.  
The central reading facility  will read daily counts/min and will analyze duration of daily 
activity and time (minutes) spent in sedentary, light, moderate, and vigorous physical activity  based on the [ Freedson 1998 ] and [ Evenson  2008 ] cut -points for adults and 
adolescents, respectively . These data will be  transferred to Actelion.  
To be considered evaluable, physical activity should be measured for at least 4  complete 
daily daytime periods  (out of 9 consecutive days) at a specific time point of assessment. A 
complete day is defined as a record of at least 7  hours of daily data (after excluding the 
periods when the device was apparently not worn [ Troiano  2008 ]). 
Accelerometer devices will be provided to the investigational site before the start of the study. 7.2.2.3 NT-proBNP measurement  
NT-proBNP is measured  at Visits  2 (Randomization), 4 (Week 16), and 6 (Week  52), 
according to central laboratory working procedures. The results will be disclosed after 
database lock and unblinding.

 7.2.2.4 Composite endpoint of time to clinical worsening  
Occurrence of a component of the time to clinical worsening  endpoint is captured by the 
investigator via AE reportin g, anamnesis (change in FC), appearance of laboratory 
abnormalities, assessment, or concomitant medication (initiation of new treatment).  
These could occur at any time, although some parameters are only assessed at site visits 
[see Table 2 ]. 
7.2.3 Safety assessments  
The definitions, reporting and follow -up of AEs, SAEs and pregnancies are described in 
Section  9. 
• Treatment -emergent AEs and SAEs up to 30 days after study treatment discontinu ation 
are captured in the eCRF. Details include severity, causality with treatment, action taken with treatmen t, duration, outcome, need for hospitalization, relatedness of 
hospitalization due to Fontan-circulation problems, and duration of hospitalization. 
• AEs leading to premature discontinuation of study treatment are derived from the reported AEs in the eCRF. 
• Change in vital signs (systolic and diastolic BP  and pulse rate), and body weight from 
Baseline (Visit 2) to all assessed time  points during the study. Vital signs are assessed 
at each study visit and body weight is assessed during each CPET.  
• Treatment -emer gent marked laboratory abnormalities up to 30 days after study 
treatment discontinuation.  
• Change in laboratory parameters from Baseline (Visit 2) to all assessed time  points 
during the study. Laboratory data will be provided via the central laboratory ; the details 
on alert flags and normal ranges can be found in Appendix 1. 
7.2.3.1 Physical examination  
Physical examination at screening includes the examination of the general appearance, 
head, ears, eyes, nose, throat, neck, lymph nodes, extremities, neurological system, skin, musculoskeletal system, gastro -intestinal, heart and lungs. At subsequent visits, physical 
examination is tailored to organs that are prompted by ad hoc  anamnesis  or are needed to 
be assessed to detect morbidity events (e.g., edema). Information from  all physical examinations must be included in the source documentation 
at the study site. The observations should be reported according to body system in the e CRF 
as either normal or abnormal. If an abnormality is found it should be specified on the corresponding e CRF page , describing the signs related to the abnormality (e.g., syst olic 
murmur) and not the diagnosis (e.g., mitral valve insufficiency). Clinically relevant findings (other than those related to Fontan circulation) that are present prior to signing of informed consent must be recorded on the Medical History e CRF page. Physical

 examination findings made after signing of informed consent, which meet the definition of an AE [Section  9.1.1] , must be recorded on the AE page of the e CRF.  
7.2.3.2 Vital signs  
Vital signs ( BP, pulse rate) will be measured  at all scheduled visits except S -FU. 
Systolic and diastolic BP  and radial pulse measurements will be measured in a supine or 
sitting position. It is recommended to allow the subject to rest for at least 5  minutes . The  
same position (supine or sitting) and same location (left/right arm) must be used throughout 
the study for an individual subject. In addition, SpO
2 will be measured (by pulse oximeter) at al l scheduled visits.  
For each individual subject, the same device should be used throughout the study. When applicable, vital signs are recommended to be measured  before the CPET . 
7.2.3.3 Weight and h eight  
Height and body weight will be measured at all scheduled visits except S -FU. These are 
captured in the eCRF. Body weight will be measured in indoor clothing but without shoes . 
For each individual subject, the same device should be used throughout the study. 7.2.3.4 ECG assessment  
ECG is  assessed at Screening (Visit  1) and abnormalities (assessed by a cardiologist), if 
any, are reported as part of medical history  in the eCRF . 
Subsequently, ECG is assessed as part of CPET , and data are evaluat ed at site. ECG data 
will not be transmitted to  the central reading facility apart from pre- exercise rhythm and 
HR for evaluation of CPET. 7.2.3.5 Echocardiography 
Standard 2D/Doppler trans -thoracic echocardiography (ECHOC) is performed at 
Screening  to determine the subject ’s eligibility  and at EOT. The ECHOC  will be read 
locally at the investigational site.  
The measures/assessments evaluated by the ECHOC include, but are not  limited to: s ingle 
ventricle ejection fraction, Fontan circulation stenosis , and valvular defects (severe AV 
valve regurgitation, outflow obstruction). The ejection fraction  measured locally at Screening and at EOT will be recorded in the 
eCRF . If post -baseline ECHOC is performed according to medical practice or in case of 
deteriorating patient conditions, the results of the exams should be reported in the eCRF. 
Detailed instructions on how to record ECHOC are provided in Appendix 2.

 7.2.3.6 VSFU  
A VSFU will be performed by the sponsor within 8 weeks after SCL announcement to 
determine each subject ’s vital status (alive, dead,  or unknown) at this time:  
This VSFU will be performed  either : 
• by the investigational site via a contact with the subject or parents/legal representatives/caregivers (phone call or any other means allowed per local regulations, e.g., access to public registries  including the use of locator agencies ) 
during the first 4 weeks following SCL announcement. 
Or, if unsuccessful , 
• by the investigational site assessing the vital status of the subject by any other means 
allowed per local regulations, e.g., access to medical registries, public, or 
governmental registries including the use of locator agencies during the following 4 
weeks.   
If the subject ’s individual EOS occurs within 4 weeks of the SCL announcement, VSFU 
does not need to be performed. The outcome of the VSFU is reported in the eCRF. 7.2.4 Laboratory assessments 
Laboratory tests are conducted at each visit. Full hematology and clinical chemistry panels [see Section  7.2.4.2]  are done at Screening, Visits  2 (Randomization), 4 (Week  16), and 6 
(Week  52). Laboratory assessments are done for aminotransferases, hemoglobin, and 
pregnancy monthly (28 ± 7 days)  until Week  24. Subsequently, aminotransferases and 
hemoglobin are done at Week  32, Week  40, Week  52, and at S -FU. Additional liver tests 
may be performed as clinically indicated, and as recommended per local label . Pregna ncy 
testing continues on a monthly basis. 7.2.4.1 Type of laboratory 
A central laboratory (see central laboratory manual for contact details) will be used for the analysis of all protocol -mandated laboratory tests, including re -tests due to laboratory 
abnormalities an d laboratory tests performed at unscheduled visits. Central laboratory data 
will be automatically transferred from the central laboratory database to Actelion ’s clinical 
database.  
Whenever possible, blood samples will be collected at site and sent for anal ysis to the 
central laboratory.

 If the results from the central laboratory are not available in time for randomization of the subject, an additional blood sample may be drawn to verify eligibility based on a local laboratory test . The local laboratory resu lts (with the corresponding normal ranges) must 
be recorded in the e CRF.  
A serum  pregnancy test (for females of childbearing potential) will be analyzed at Visit  1 
(Screening) and complemented with urine pregnancy tests up to 30 days after study drug 
discontinuation. Any positive urine pregnancy test must be followed up by a serum 
pregnancy test.  
Other exceptional circumstances that will require recording of local laboratory results  of 
the parameters described in Section  7.2.4.2 (with corresponding normal ranges) include 
hospitalization of the subject due to a medical emergenc y and missing central laboratory 
results from a scheduled or unscheduled visit. If two  consecutive central laboratory samples are lost or cannot be analyzed for whatever 
reason, the investigator will collect an additional sample as soon as possible for rep eat 
analysis, unless a local laboratory sample was collected within the s ame time -window and 
these test results are available.  
Under specific circumstances (e.g., if the subject lives far from the site and cannot return every month), laboratory samples may  be collected at a laboratory close to where the 
subject lives (satellite laboratory  for blood draw ) and sent to the central laboratory for 
analysis. In such a case, the satellite laboratory must be provided with the central laboratory sampling kits. Shipment of the samples will be organized by the satellite laboratory. The supervision of the satellite laboratory remains the responsibility of the PI.  
As an alternative option, the laboratory samples may be collected from subjects by a flying nurse service us ing central laboratory sampling kits.  
In the exceptional event that a local laboratory is utilized for the collection and analysis of 
blood samples (e.g., the subject is admitted in a hospital other than the site), laboratory certification / reference ran ges / laboratory director’ s curriculum vitae will be collected 
retrospectively by Actelion. Local laboratory results* and reference ranges will be collected in the eCRF.  
*As a minimum, the following local laboratory results (i.e., results from samples collected and analyzed locally) will be collected in the eCRF:  • Any local laboratory result related to the diagnostic work- up (i.e., detection, 
confirmation and/or monitoring) of ALT and/or AST elevations of  ≥ 3 × ULN. In such 
cases, the minimum data to be an alyzed and entered in the eCRF are ALT, AST, AP, 
and total and direct bilirubin.

 • Any local laboratory result related to the diagnostic work- up (i.e., detection, 
confirmation and/or monitoring) of hemoglobin decrease from baseline of ≥  50 g/L, a 
value of hemoglobin < 100 g/L, or a hemoglobin decrease requiring transfusion.  
• Any local laboratory test documenting the result of an assessment requested per protocol and for which no central laboratory result is available (e.g., in the case that no sample was sent to the central laboratory at a planned visit because the subject was hospitalized at another hospital, or in the case that the sample sent to the central laboratory is uninterpretable [e.g., hemolyzed]).  
• Any local laboratory result related to the documentation or follow -up of an AE or an 
SAE, including clinically significant abnormal laboratory results and their follow-up.  
In the event that several local laboratory samples have been collected on the same day, or if the sample was tested several times, the “ worst ” value (e.g., highest value for ALT/AST) 
should be reported in the eCRF (together with the local laboratory reference ranges). Central laboratory reports will be sent to the investigator. In case of specific (pre -defined) 
laboratory abnormalities, the central laboratory will alert Actelion personnel and the concerned site personnel. Alert flags that will trigger such notifications are displayed in Appendix 1. All laboratory reports must be reviewed, signed and dated by the investigator or delegate within 5 working days of receipt and filed with the hospital chart . The investigator/delegate 
must indicate on the laborator y report whether abnormal values are considered clinically 
relevant or not. Clinically relevant laboratory findings that are known at the time of signing of informed consent must be recorded on the Medical History page of the e CRF. Any 
clinically relevant laboratory abnormalities (including ALT/AST abnormalities  ≥3 × ULN)  
detected after signing of informed consent must be reported as an AE or SAE as appropriate [see Section  9], and must be followed until the value returns to within the normal range or 
is stable, or until the change is no longer clinically relevant , except when otherwise 
specified (e.g., in the case of ALT/AST abnormalities 
[see Section  5.1.11.2] ). Further 
laboratory analysis should be performed as indicated and according to the judgment of the 
investigator.  
Any pregnancy occurring during the treatment period and up to 30 days after study drug discontinuation must be reported immediately to the  sponsor using the  Pregnancy 
Notification Form [see Section  9.3.1]. Details about the collection, sampling, storage, 
shipment procedures, and reporting of results and abnormal findings can be found in the laboratory manual.

7.2.6 Pharmacoeconomic assessments  
Pharmacoeconomic parameters will be assessed as described in Section 6.4 . 
Data elements to be collected on the eCRF include: Hospitalization admission date, discharge date, reason for admission.  
7.2.7 Pharmac okinetic and pharmacodynamics assessments  
7.2.7.1 Pharmacokinetic assessments  
Trough (pre-dose) plasma concentrations of macitentan and its metabolite ACT -132577, 
are obtained via blood samples taken at Week  4 (during the regular corresponding monthly 
blood draw ) and Week  16 (Visit 4 ), or at EOT in the case of premature study drug 
discontinuation prior to Week  16. 
Importantly, blood samples must be drawn before the morning dose of study treatment and after BP measurement.  
Approximately 2 mL of blood will be collected by direct venipuncture in an antecubital vein in the arm in Monovette tubes (or equivalent) containing K3-ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid. Immediately following collection of the required 
blood volume, the tubes will be slowly tilted backwards and forwards (no shaking) to bring the anti -coagulant into solution, and immediately cooled on ice. Within 30 minutes of 
collection, the tubes will be centrifuged at approximately 1500 G for 10 minutes at 2 -8° C. 
When a centrifuge that can be cooled is not available, the blood samples and the bucket of the centrifuge must be cooled on ice prior to centrifugation. The plasma will be transferred into one labeled polypropylene tube  avoiding carry- over of erythrocytes. All samples will 
be stored in an upright position at −20° C (±  4° C).  
Note : a short duration of storage at temperatures below − 20° C (±  4° C) is acceptable.

Labeling and shipment  
Details of the collection and regular shipment of the samples to the central laboratory can be found in the central laboratory manual. The tubes and labels for the samples will be provided to the site by the central laboratory. The labeling will comply with the applicable laws and regulations of the countries in which the study is conducted. The central laboratory will forward the samples to the bioanalytical laboratory  or equivalent local 
option. Bioanalysis Data of the samples from subjects will be provided after database closure by the bioanalytical laboratory. No samples should be destroyed until the study report is signed off. 
Macitentan and ACT -132577 plasma concentrations will be determined using a validated 
liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry assay. The foreseen limit of quantitation is 1.00 ng/mL. Concentrations will be calculated by interpolation from a calibration curve. Quality control samples will be analyzed throughout the study, their measured concentrations will be used to determine between -run and overall precision and 
accuracy of the analyses.  
8 STUDY COMPLETION AND POST- STUDY TREATMENT / 
MEDICAL CARE  
8.1 Study completion as per protocol  
A subject who completes the full  52 weeks and the S- FU period is considered to have 
completed the study as per protocol. This is true regardless of whether the 52  weeks were 
on treatment or not.  For a n individual subject, the study is completed with the EOS, which corresponds to the 
S-FU visit performed 30 –35 days after the EOT visit and the EOP  (if applicable).  
Note that the S -FU visit may not be needed for  subject s who  enter  the AC- 055H302 OL 
extension at EOT of AC -055H301; these subjects are still considered to have completed 
the study. Study completion is reached once all subjects have completed the EOS  and is 
communicated  to the sites  via the SCL announcement.

8.2 Premature withdrawal from study  
Subjects may voluntarily withdraw from the study without justification for any reason at any time. Subjects are considered withdrawn if they state an inten tion to withdraw further 
participation in all components of the study (i.e., withdrawal of consent), die, or are lost to follow -up. If a subject withdraws consent, no further data will be collected in the e CRF 
from the date of withdrawal onward. The invest igator may withdraw a subject from the 
study (without regard to the subject ’s consent) if, on balance, he/she believes that continued 
participation in the study would be contrary to the best interests of the subject. Withdrawal from the study may also result from a decision by Actelion for any reason, including premature termination or suspension of the study. Subjects are considered as lost to follow -up if all reasonable attempts by the investigator 
to communicate with the individual failed. The site must take preventive measures to avoid a subject being lost to follow -up (e.g., document different ways of contact such as 
telephone number, home address, email address, person to be contacted in case the subject cannot be reached). If the subject cannot be rea ched, the site must make a reasonable effort 
to contact the subject, document all attempts, and enter the loss of follow -up information 
into the e CRF. The f ollowing methods must be used: a t least three telephone calls must be 
placed to the last available t elephone number , and one registered letter must be sent by post 
to the last available home address. Additional methods may be acceptable if they are compliant with local rules/regulations (e.g., a visit by site personnel to the subject ’s home , 
use of locat or agencies ), respecting the subject ’s right to privacy. If the subject is still 
unreachable after all contact attempts listed above, he/she will be considered to be lost to follow -up. 
If premature withdrawal occurs for any reason, the reason (if known) for premature withdrawal from the study, along with who made the decision (subject, investigator, or Actelion personnel) must be recorded in the eCRF, if known. If for whatever reason (except death or loss -to-follow- up) a subject is withdrawn from the 
study, the investigator should make efforts to schedule a last appointment  / telephone call 
to assess the safety and well -being of the subject, collect unused study treatment and 
discuss follow -up medical care. Data obtained during this last appointment  / telephone call 
will be recorded in the subjects ’ medical records , but it will not be collected in the eCRF. 
The investigator must provide follow -up medical care for all subjects who are prematurely 
withdrawn from the study, or must refer them for appropriate ong oing care, as described 
in Section 8.4 .

 8.3 Premature termination or suspension of the study  
Actelion reserves the right to terminate the study at any time globally or locally. Investigators can terminate the participation of their site in the study at any time. If a study is prematurely suspended or terminated, Actelion will promptly inform the investigators, the IECs/IRBs, and health au thorities, as appropriate, and provide the reasons 
for the suspension or t ermination.  
If the study is suspended or prematurely terminated for any reason, the investigator  – in 
agreement with Actelion – must promptly inform all enrolled subjects and ensure their 
appropriate treatment and follow-up, as described in Section 8.4. Actelion may inform the 
investigator of additional procedures to be followed in order to ensure that adequate consideration is given to the protection of the subjects’ interests.  
In addition, if the investigator suspends or terminates a study without prior agreement from Actelion, the investigator must promptly inform Actelion personnel and the IEC/IRB, and provide both with a detailed written explanation of the termination or suspension. If the IEC/IRB suspends or terminates its approval  / favorable opinion of a study, the 
investigator must promptly notify Actelion personnel and provide a detailed written explanation of the termination or suspension. Any suspension or premature termination of the study must be discussed with the IDMC. 
8.4 Medical care of subjects after study completion / withdrawal from study  
After the subject ’s study completion or premature withdrawal from the study, whichever 
applies, the investigator/delegate will explain to subjects what treatment(s) / medical care 
is necessary and available according to local regulations.  
Contraceptive measures must continue up to at least 30  days after EOT . 
Following completion of the AC-055H301 study, subjects are offered participation in the 
AC-055H302 OL extension study, if the study is approved at the respective investigational 
site.  
Enrollment into the AC -055H302 OL extension study will depend on whether eligibility 
criteria for the AC -055H302 OL e xtension study are met, as well as the investigator ’s 
judgment about  whether treatment with macitentan could be beneficial. The assessment  of 
the benefit/risk will be performed at subject level, by the investigator. 
9 SAFETY DEFINITIONS AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS  
Timely, accurate, and complete reporting and analysis of safety information, including AEs, SAEs, and PQC, from clinical studies are crucial for the protection of participants, investigators, and the sponsor, and are mandated by regulatory agencies worldwide. The

 sponsor has established Standard Operating Procedures in conformity with regulatory requirements worldwide to ensure appropriate reporting of safety information; all clinical studies conducted by the sponsor or its affiliates  will be conducted in accordance with those 
procedures. 
9.1 Adverse events  
9.1.1 Definition of adverse events  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence, i.e., any unfavorable and unintended sign, including an abnormal laboratory finding, symptom, or disease that occurs in a subject during the course of the study, whether or not considered by the investigator as related to study treatment. A treatment  emergent AE is any AE temporally associated with the use of study treatment 
(from study treatment initiation until 30  days after study treatment discontinuation) 
whether or not considered by the investigator as related to study treatment.  
AEs include: • Exacerbation of a pre- existing disease.  
• Exacerbation of a pre- existing disease with the exception of efficacy endpoints and  
associated symptoms.  
• Increase in frequency or intensity of a pre -existing episodic disease or medical 
condition. 
• Disease or medical condition detected or diagnosed during the course of the study even though it may have been present prior to the start of the study. 
• Continuous persistent disease or symptoms present at study start that worsen following the signing of informed consent.  
• Abnormal assessments, e.g., change on physical examination, ECG findings, if they represent a clinically significant finding that was not present at study start or worsened during the course of the study. 
• Laboratory test abnormalities if they represent a clinically significant finding, symptomatic or not, that was not present at study start or worsened during  the course 
of the study or led to dose reduction, interruption or permanent discontinuation of study treatment.  
Hepatic AEs of special interest may be fol lowed up using the hepatic event questionnaire 
distributed by the sponsor. Overdose , misuse, abuse of the study treatment and study treatment errors will be reported 
as an AE  [see Section 9.6 ].

 9.1.2 Intensity of adverse events 
The intensity of clinical AEs is gra ded on a three -point scale – mild, moderate, severe – 
and is reported on specific AE pages of the e CRF.  
If the intensity of an AE worsens during the study, only the worst intensity should be 
reported on the AE page. If the AE lessens in intensity, no change in the severity is required to be reported. For AEs ongoing at the start of study treatment, if the intensity worsens after the start of study treatment, the change in intensity and the date on which it occurred must be reported in the eCRF . 
The three categories of intensity are defined as follows:  
 Mild  
The event may be noticeable to the subject. It does not usually influence daily activities, and normally does not require intervention. 
 Moderate  
The event may make the subject uncomfortable. Performance of  daily activities may be 
influenced, and intervention may be needed. 
 Severe  
The event may cause noticeable discomfort and usually interferes with daily activities. The subject may not be able to continue in the study, and treatment or intervention is usual ly 
needed. A mild, moderate, or severe AE may or may not be serious [see Section  9.2.1]. These terms 
are used to describe the intensity of a specific event. Medical  judgment should be used on 
a case -by-case basis.  
Seriousness, rather than intensity assessment, determines the regulatory reporting obligations. 9.1.3 Relationship to study treatment  
Each AE must be assessed by the investigator as to whether or not there is a r easonable 
possibility of causal relationship to the study treatment and reported as either related or not related . The determination of the likelihood that the study treatment caused the AE will be 
provided by the investigator who is a qualified physician. 9.1.4 Reporting of adverse events  
All AEs with an onset date after signing of informed consent and up to 30 days after study treatment discontinuation  or until initiation of study drug in the AC-055H302 OL extension

 study, whichever occurs first , must be recorded on specific AE pages of the AC-055H301 
eCRF.   
All AEs must be documented in the corresponding subject medical records. Data such as evaluation of maximum intensity and evaluation of possible relationship to study treatment are also to be documented in the source documents. The investigator who performed the 
AE assessment should be identifiable in the source documents.  
9.1.5 Follow- up of adverse events  
The investigator is obligated to perform or arrange for the conduct of supplemental measurements and evaluations as medically indicated to elucidate the nature and causality of the AE, SAE, or product quality complaint (PQC) [see Section 9.5] as fully as pos sible. 
This may include additional laboratory tests or investigations, histopathological examinations, or consultation with other health care professionals. AEs still ongoing more than 30 days after study treatment discontinuation must be followed 
up until  they are no longer considered clinically relevant or until stabilization. The follow -
up information obtained after the subject ’s EOS visit / telephone call will not be collected 
by Actelion, except in the case of serious adverse events [ Section 9.2.4]. 
9.2 Serious adverse events  
9.2.1 Definitions of serious adverse events  
An SAE is defined by the ICH guidelines as any AE fulfilling at least one of the following criteria:  
• Fatal. 
• Life-threatening: Refers to an event in which the subject was at risk of death at the time 
of the event. It does not refer to an event that hypothetically might have caused death had it been more severe.  
• Requiring in -patient hospitalization  or prolongation of existing hospitalization. 
• Resulting in persistent or significant disability or incapacity.  
• Congenital anomaly or birth defect. 
• Is a suspected transmission of any infectious agent via a medicinal product. 
• Medically significant: Refers to important medical events that may not immediately result in death, be life -threatening, or require hospitalization but may be considered to 
be SAEs when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject, and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in the definitions above. 
The following reasons for hospitalization are not considered as SAEs: • Hospitalization for cosmetic elective surgery, or social and/or convenience reasons.

CONFIDENTIAL - FOIA Exemptions Apply in U.S. 
 • Hospitalization for pre -planned (i.e., planned prior to signing informed consent) 
surgery or standard monitoring of a pre -existing disease or medical condition that did 
not worsen, e.g., hospitalization for coronary angiography in a subject with stable angina pectoris.  
However, complications that occur during such hospitalization are AEs or SAEs.  
9.2.2 Reporting of serious adverse events 
All SAEs , as well as PQCs,  occurring after signing of informed consent  up to 30 days after 
study treatment discontinuation or u ntil initiation of study drug in the OL extension study, 
whichever occurs first , must be reported on AE pages in the e CRF and on an SAE form, 
regardless of the investigator -attributed causal relationship with study treatment or 
study- mandated procedures.  
An SAE is defined as related to protocol -mandated procedures if it appears to have a 
reasonable possibility of a causal relationship to either the study design or to protocol-mandated procedures (e.g., conduct of CPET ). 
9.2.3 Follow- up of serious adverse events 
SAEs still ongoing more than 30 days after study treatment discontinuation  must be 
followed up until resolution or stabilization, or until the event outcome is provided. The follow -up information obtained after the subject ’s EOS /  telephone call mus t be reported 
to the sponsor, but it is not recorded in the e CRF.  
9.2.4 After the 30 -day follow- up period 
For subjects in the PTOP , all SAEs until Week  52 have to be reported in the eCRF and to 
the sponsor within 24 hours of the investigator ’s knowledge of the e vent. 
For subjects not participating in the PTOP, new SAEs occurring after the 30- day follow -up 
period must be reported to the sponsor  within 24  hours of the investigator ’s knowledge of 
the event, only  if considered by the investigator to be causally related to previous exposure 
to the study treatment.  
9.2.5 Reporting procedures  
All SAEs must be reported by the investigator to the sponsor  (or the CRO’ s drug safety 
department) within 24 hours of the investigator’s first knowledge of the event. All SAEs must be recorded on an SAE form, irrespective of the study treatment received by the subject, and whether or not this event is considered by the investigator to be related to study treatment.

 The SAE forms must b e sent to the sponsor  (contact details are provided on the SAE form).  
The investigator must complete the SAE form in English  and must assess the event ’s causal 
relationship to the study treatment.  
Any relevant information from source documents regarding th e SAE, e.g., hospital notes 
or discharge summaries, etc., must be summarized on the SAE form.  
Follow- up information about a previously reported SAE must also be reported within 
24 hours of receiving it. Sponsor personnel may contact the investigator to obt ain further 
information. If the subject is hospitalized in a hospital other than the study site, it is the investigator ’s 
responsibility to contact this hospital to obtain all SAE -relevant information and 
documentation. The expectedness of an adverse react ion is determined by the sponsor  in the reference 
safety information (RSI) section provided in the most recent version of the IB. Any SAE that is assessed as related and unexpected against the RSI is known as a SUSAR  
The sponsor assumes responsibility for appropriate reporting of AEs to the regulatory authorities. The sponsor will also report to the investigator (and the head of the investigational institute where required) all suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSARs). The investigator (or sponsor where required) must report SUSARs to the appropriate Independent Ethics Committee/Institutional Review Board (IEC/IRB) that approved the protocol unless otherwise required and documented by the IEC/IRB. A 
SUSAR will be reported to regulatory authorities unblinded. Participating investigators and IEC/IRB will receive a blinded SUSAR summary, unless otherwise specified.  
9.3 Pregnancy  
If a woman becomes pregnant while on study treatment, study treatment must be interrupted . The investigator must counsel the subject and discuss the risks of continuing 
with the pregnancy and the possible effects on the fetus. 9.3.1 Reporting of pregnancy  
All initial reports of pregnancy in female subjects or partners of male subjects occurring 
after study start (i.e., sig ning of informed consent) and with an estimated conception date 
up to 30 days following study treatment discontinuation must  be reported to the sponsor by 
the study-site personnel within 24 hours of the investigator ’s knowledge of the event. 
Pregnancies mu st be reported on the Pregnancy Notification form, which is sent to the 
sponsor ( or the CRO’ s drug safety department; see contact details provided on the 
Pregnancy form), and in the eCRF on an AE page.

 9.3.2 Follow- up of pregnancy  
Follow- up information regarding the outcome of the pregnancy in female subjects or 
partners of male subjects and any postnatal sequelae in the infant will be required  and 
reported using the  Product Exposure During Pregnancy Collection and  End of Pregnancy 
Collection forms . Follow -up information exceeding the 30- day S-FU will only be entered 
in the Global Medical  Safety database and will not affect SCL.  
Any AE associated with the pregnancy occurring during the follow -up period after study 
treatment discontinuation must be reported on s eparate AE pages in the e CRF. Abnormal 
pregnancy outcomes (e.g. spontaneous abortion, fetal death, stillbirth, congenital abnormalities, ectopic pregnancy) are considered SAE s and  must be reported on an SAE 
form as described in Section  9.2.5. 
9.4 Study safety monitoring  
Study safety information (AEs, SAEs, laboratory values, ECGs, vital signs, and study- specific examinations as required) is monitored and reviewed on a continuous basis 
by the Actelion Clinical Team (in charge of ensuring subjects ’ safety as well as data 
quality). In addition, an IDMC is monitoring safety data in an unbli nded manner  [see 
Section  3.3]. Actelion may request additional data pertaining to the diagnostic work -up of 
an AE or SAE (e.g., medical imaging, local laboratory values) for the purpose of safety monitoring. Such additional data may be shared with external experts. 
9.5 Product quality complaints  
A product quality complaint (PQC) is defined as any suspicion of a product defect  related 
to manufacturing, labeling, or packaging, i.e., any dissatisfaction relative to the identity, 
quality, durability, or reliability of a product, including its labeling or package integrity. A PQC may have an impact on the safety and efficacy of the product. In  addition, it includes 
any technical complaints, defined as any complaint that indicates a potential quality issue during manufacturing, packaging, release testing, stability, monitoring, storage and distribution of the product. 9.5.1 Procedures  
All initial PQCs  must be reported to the sponsor by the study site personnel within 24 hours 
after being made aware of the event.  
A sample of the suspected product should be maintained under the correct storage conditions until a shipment request is received from the sponsor. If the defect is combined with a n SAE , the study site personnel must report the PQC to the 
sponsor according to the SAE  reporting timelines [ refer to Section  9.2.5 ].

 9.6 Special reporting situations  
Safety events of interest on a sponsor study intervention in an interventional study that may require expedited reporting or safety evaluation include, but are not limited to:  
• Overdose of a sponsor study intervention 
• Suspected abuse/misuse of a sponsor study intervention 
• Accidental or occupational exposure to a sponsor study intervention 
• Medication error, intercepted medication error, or potential medication error involving a Johnson & Johnson medicinal product (with or without patient exposure to the Johnson & Johnson medicinal product, e.g., product name confusion, product label confusion, intercepted prescribing or dispensing errors) 
• Exposure to a sponsor study intervention from breastfeeding  
Special reporting situations should be recorded in the eCRF. Any special reporting situation that meets the criteria of an SAE should be recorded as an SAE on the AE page of the eCRF.  
9.7 Contacting Sponsor Regarding Product Qua lity 
The names (and corresponding telephone numbers) of the individuals who should be contacted regarding product quality issues are listed in the Contact Information page(s), which will be provided as a separate document.  
10 STATISTICAL METHODS  
All statistic al analyses will be conducted by Actelion or by designated CROs supervised 
by Actelion, except for  the IA, which will be conducted by the ISAC /SSG  who will provide 
results to t he IDMC .  
A Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) will provide full details of the analyses, data displays, and algorithms to be used for data derivations.  The SAP will include the definition of protocol deviations leading to exclusion from analysis sets . The list of protocol deviations  which might affect the evaluation of the effect 
of the study treatment on the primary efficacy endpoint is provided in Section 10.1.3 of 
this document. The protocol deviations will be identified by medically trained s taff on an 
ongoing basis during study conduct before study database closure.  
Individual subject listings will be provided for efficacy, quality of life, pharmacoeconomic, PK, and safety endpoints, as well as for baseline and other subject characteristics. Each listing will be broken down by treatment group, site, subject number, and assessment date  
as appropriate.

 Wherever possible, the data will be graphically presented , e.g., via box plots, scatter plots, 
KM curves, etc. The graphical presentation for KM follows the recommendations from 
Pocock on the following aspects [Pocock  2002 ]: 
• Rules for KM curves going upwards or downwards (e .g., upwards if there is a low 
number of events)  
• Termination of the vertical axis  
• Truncation of the x -axis when only around 10–20%  of the subjects are still in follow -
up.  
10.1 Analysis sets 
10.1.1 Screened Analysis Set  
The Screened Analysis Set (SCR) includes all subject s who are screened and have a subject 
identification number. 10.1.2 Full Analysis Set  
The Full Analysis Set  (FAS) includes all subjects assigned to a study treatment. In order to 
adhere to the intention -to-treat principle as much as possible:  
• Subjects are evaluat ed according to the study treatment they have been assigned to 
(which may be different from the study  treatment they have received);  
• All available data are included.  
10.1.3 Per-Protocol Set 
The Per -Protocol Set (PPS) comprises all subjects who received actual study treatment 
assigned by IVRS and who complied with the protocol sufficiently up to and including the 
Week  16 visit (Visit 4) to be likely to exhibit the treatment effects.  
Criteria for sufficient compliance include : 
• exposure to the study randomized treatm ent over 16 weeks, including the Week 16 
window [Section 10.3.2.2], with a treatment compliance of at least 80% and no more 
than 120% and without study treatment interruptions of more than 4 consecutive weeks at any time prior to, and until the Week  16 visi t (Visit 4) , 
• availability of peak  VO
2 at Week  16 (Visit 4), 
• absence of protocol deviations that  have an impact on the treatment effect including, 
but not limited to: 
– Intake of forbidden concomitant therapy up to the Week 16 visit (Visit 4) as listed 
in Section  5.2.4,  
– Deviations from the selection criteria as listed in Sections 4.3  and 4.4 such that, in 
the opinion of the study team in blinded review, assessment of efficacy with respect to the primary endpoint is compromised, such as:

o NYHA FC I or IV at Screening, 
o Peak  VO 2 < 15 mL/kg/min  at Baseline. 
The full list of criteria will be detailed in the SAP before making the full randomization information available.  
10.1.4 Safety Set  
The Safety S et (SS) includ es all subjects who received at least one dose of study treatment.  
10.1.5 Pharmacokinetic analysis set  
The Pharmacokinetic Analysis Set (PKS) includes all randomized and treated subjects, for whom a PK blood sample at trough ha s been collected  and who do not devi ate from the 
protocol in a way that might affect the evaluation of the trough concentrations. 10.1.6 Usage of the analysis sets 
The FAS is used for the main and sensitivity analyses of the primary efficacy variable, for analyses of all secondary and other efficacy variables and for the  description of the study 
population at baseline. The PPS is used to perform sensitivity analyses on the primary and  first secondary efficacy 
variables.  
The SS is used for the analysis of the safety variables.  
The PKS is used for analysis of the PK  variables.  
The SCR is used for the description of subject disposition. Unless specified otherwise, individual subject data listings are prepared on the SCR, by randomized treatment group and for screening failures  where appropriate. 
10.2 Variables  
All variables correspond to the respective study endpoints as described in S ection  6. 
10.2.1 Primary efficacy variable(s)  
The primary efficacy variable is the change in peak VO 2 from Baseline to Week  16, 
defined as Week  16 value minus B aseline value.  The values used for peak VO 2 at Baseline 
and Week  16 will be based on data evaluation by the central reading  facility .

 10.2.2 Secondary efficacy variables 
10.2.2.1 Peak  VO 2 over 52 weeks 
This secondary efficacy variable is defined as  the average change in peak VO 2 from 
baseline over time, i.e., averaged over the entire observation period with post -baseline 
assessments up  to Week  52 (CPET is planned at Basel ine and at Weeks 16 and 52; in 
addition, unscheduled CPET can occur) . Per time point of assessment , the change is 
defined as post-baseline value minus baseline value.  The overall average change ove r 52 
weeks is the mean change thereof . The values used for peak VO 2 will be based on data 
evaluation by the central reading  facility.  
10.2.2.2 Change from Baseline to Week  16 in mean count per minute of daily PA- Ac 
This secondary efficacy variable is defined as a Week 16 mean count per minute of daily 
PA-Ac minus the mean count per minute of baseline daily values. The values used for 
PA-Ac at Baseline and Week  16 will be based on data evaluation by the central reading  
facility . 
10.2.3 Other efficacy variables 
Variable s related to exercise capacity:  
Peak VO 2 at other visits than Week 16, VE/VCO 2 slope, VO 2/HR, % predicted peak  VO 2, 
VO 2 at VAT, and OUES  are collected  at all visits with CPET. Details are given in 
Section  7.2.2.1. Per variable of exercise capacity and per post -baseline assessment, 
changes from baseline are defined as post -baseline value minus baseline value.  
NT-proBNP : 
Percent of baseline at Week  16 a nd percent of baseline in NT -proBNP over  52 weeks will 
be evaluated.  The percent of baseline in NT -proBNP is defined as 100 times the 
post- baseline value divided by the baseline value.  
Time to clinical events: The individual components of the following two clinical events endpoints are defined in Section 6.1.3:  • Composite endpoint of event s related to Fontan -palliated cl inical worsening  and,  
• Composite endpoint of e vents related to Fontan -palliated morbidity.  
The dates of occurrence  of each component of the above two clinical event endpoints are 
reported in the eCRF.  For each composite endpoint, a subject is considered as having an event if the investigator 
reports the occurrence of any of the individual component in the eCRF.  Subjects who did not experience an event will be censored .

• for subjects with an event: the earliest  date of occurrence of any of the individual 
components minus date of R andomization plus 1 divided by 7, 
• for censored subjects: the EOS date minus date of Randomization plus 1 divided by 7. 
 
Overall survival (OS) : 
The v ital status (alive , dead, or unknown) will be reported in the eCRF [ see 
Section  7.2.3.6] .  
Subjects who are known to be alive  at the time of VSFU  will be censored at the date of 
VSFU . Subjects with unknown vital status at VSFU  will be censored at the time of the last 
contact (e.g., at the date of last study visit, last treatment day or EOS).  
Time to death is expressed in weeks  and calculated as the date of death minus date of 
Randomization plus 1, divided by 7 or, for censored subjects, as censoring date minus date 
of Randomization plus 1, divided by 7. Physical activity:  
Physical activity efficacy variables include: 
• the change from Baseline to Week 52 in mean count per minute of daily activity and  
• the change from Baseline to Weeks 16 and 52 in daily mean time in minutes spent in 
sedentary, light, moderate, or vigorous physical activity.  
Changes from Baseline are defined as post -baseline value minus baseline value.  
10.2.4 Safety variables 
Adverse events: 
An AE is defined as any event that is recorded on the AE e CRF module regardless of the 
onset date. Treatment -emergent events are those with onset date/time  ≥ start date/time of study 
treatment and  ≤ 30 days after EOT . 
Serious events are those with seriousness assessed as ‘serious’ by the investigator 
according to the definition in Section 9.2.1. 
Related AEs are those with relationship to the use of study treatment judged as ‘ reasonably 
possible’ by the investigator.  
AEs leading to premature discontinuation of study treatment are those with action taken with study drug reported as ‘permanently discontinued’ by the investigator.

 Laboratory data : 
Laboratory analyses are based on data received from the central laboratory. All transferred central laboratory data are taken into account regardless of whether they correspond to scheduled or unscheduled assessments.  
Baseline laboratory test refers to the latest laboratory test performed prior to the start of study treatment. EOT laboratory test refers to the laboratory test performed at the EOT visit. If no laboratory data are available for th e EOT visit, the results of the latest available post -baseline 
laboratory tests performed prior to EOT date/time are used for the analysis.  
For a list of laboratory tests see Section  7.2.4.2. Per laboratory test and post -baseline 
assessment, changes from baseline are defined as post -baseline value minus baseline value. 
Marked laboratory abnormalities are those defined in Appendix 1. Treatment- emergent 
laboratory abnormalities are those with a sampling after the start of study treatment and ≤  30 days after  EOT . 
Vital signs : 
Systolic BP, diastolic BP, pulse rate, SpO 2, height and body weight are measured at all 
scheduled visits and reported in the eCRF. Per vital sign and post -baseline assessment, 
changes from baseline are defined as post -baseline value minus baseline value.  
Baseline vital sign refers to the latest vital sign measuremen t performed prior to the start 
of study treatment.  
Echocardiography: 
Single ventricle ejection fraction, Fontan circulation stenosis, and valvular defects (severe AV valve regurgitation, outflow obstruction)  are measured at the Screening and EOT visit 
and reported in the eCRF.  Per ECHOC parameters and post -baseline assessment, changes 
from baseline are defined as post -baseline value minus baseline value.  
10.2.5 Quality of life variables  
Details will be included in the statistical analysis plan.  
10.2.6 Pharmacoeconomic variables 
The annualized rate of all -cause and Fontan -related hospitalizations will be calculated

10.3 General Description of statistical analyses  
Data are listed and summarized by appropriate descriptive statistics (tables or figures), 
including: • Number of non- missing observations, mean, standard deviation (SD) , minimum, Q1, 
median, Q3 and maximum for continuous variables, 
• Numbe r of events, number of censored observations, number of subjects at risk, and KM  
estimates of the survival function for time -to-event variables,  hazard ratios and 
corresponding 95% confidence intervals,  
• Number of non- missing observations, frequency with percentage per category 
(percentages based on the number of non- missing observations) for categorical safety 
variables,  
• Number of missing observations and frequency with percentage per category (percentages based on the total number of observations) for categorical variables other than safety variables.  
The number of missing values is  displayed only if  > 0. For continuous variables it is 
displayed after the number of non -missing observations, f or categorical variables after the 
last category.  
10.3.1 Overall testing strategy  
The effect of macitentan 10  mg as compared to placebo will be statistically tested on the 
primary efficacy variable at an overall Type I error of 1% two -sided . The study would be 
‘conclusive’ at the two -sided 1% level, it could also be declared ‘positive’ at a significance 
level of 5% on the primary efficacy variable. This study implements one IA for unblinded sample size re -estimation which will be 
conducted approximately when the first 95 subjects (i.e. , 70% of  the pre-planned sample 
size) are randomized and have completed their Week  16 CPET assessment (i.e., 
Visit 4/Week  16), or withdrew from the study without a Week 16 CPET assessment. This 
sample size re- estimation allows the sample size to be potenti ally increased up to 
268 subjects based on conditional power considerations for the primary efficacy endpoint [see Section  10.5.3]. This IA will be implemented through  an IDMC. The SAP written by

 Actelion will include the description of the statistical methods and analyse s to be applied 
to the primary efficacy endpoint and the details on the statistical decision rules for the 
implementation of the IA , which may be used as guidance . The inverse normal combination 
method will be utilized to combine first- stage p -value (based on actual number of subjects 
available at the time of IA) and second -stage p -value  (based on the remaining number of 
subjects required to reach the total sample size after IA results) for the control of the type -1 
error rate [Lehmacher  1999].  The guideline for calculating the combination weights will 
be included in the  SAP and will be based on the available individual information fractions 
at the time of the IA. Combination weights will not be adjusted based on the IA decision.  If the primary endpoint is statistically significant at a significance level α  = 1% two -sided  
at final analysis, the secondary efficacy endpoints will be analyzed at the same significance level as the primary efficacy endpoint (i.e., 1% two -sided) using a hier archical testing 
procedure following the order of the endpoints as listed in Section 6.1.2.  Similar  to the primary efficacy endpoint, the final analysis of the sec ondary efficacy 
endpoints will be conducted using the inverse normal combination method with pre-specified weights to combine first and second stage p -values.  
Safety variab les and other variables will not be formally statistically tested.  
Guidelines for sample size re- estimation are defined in the  SAP. Procedures to maintain 
data integrity in the presence of sample size adaptation  are given in a separate document . 
10.3.2 Analysis of the primary efficacy variable(s)  
10.3.2.1 Hypotheses and statistical model 
The statistical hypothese s for the primary endpoint are formulated in terms of the arithmetic  
mean s (M) of change in peak VO
2 in subjects treated with either placebo or macitentan 
10 mg from Baseline (Visit 2) to Week 16 (Visit 4). 
H0: M macitentan 10  mg = M  placebo  versus 
HA: M macitentan 10  mg ≠ M  placebo   
The null hypothesis will be  tested as per primary variable at a two -sided Type I error of 
1% for conclusiveness. Assuming the normal distribution of the primary variable , the null hypo thesis will be tested 
by means of an analysis of covariance ( ANCOVA) model on the change in peak  VO
2 at 
Week 16. Model covariates  will include randomized treatment, geographical region and 
peak  VO 2 at Baseline (Visit 2) .

 For subject k in geographical region  j under treatment i , the additive linear statistical model 
is 
 yijk = a + β 1Ti + β2Rj + β3xijk + e ijk,  
where,  • y
ijk denotes the change from baseline to Week  16 (Visit 4) in peak VO 2 for subject k  
in geographical region j  under treatment i , 
• a denotes the common intercept,  
• Ti denotes the treatment group i  with i=1 for macitentan 10  mg and i=0 for placebo, 
• Rj denotes geographical region j with j=1 to the total number of regions (America, 
Europe, Asia, Oceania), 
• xijk denotes the peak  VO 2 value at Baseline (Visit 2) for subject k  in geographical

• β1, β2 and β3 denote the model coefficients of the treatment, geographical region and 
baseline value effects, respectively.  
The difference between treatments at Week  16 will be used  to test the null hypothesis of 
equality of treatment effects.  According to the model notation, null and alternative 
hypotheses above conform to H 0: β1 = 0 versus H 1: β1 ≠ 0. 
The primary estimand for the primary efficacy endpoint is defined as:  A. Population:  All randomized Fontan -palliated adult and adolescent subjects defined 
through protocol inclusion/exclusion criteria (i.e., FAS).  
B. Variable:  peak VO
2 as change from baseline to Week 16.  
C. Intercurrent events:   
• Death occurring before W eek 16 
In case of death prior to Week 16, this will result in imputing the change from baseline 
to Week 16. A worst -case imputation will be applied as detailed in Section 10.3.2.2. 
• Non-missing peak VO 2 value at Week 16 assessed as ‘invalid’ by the central 
reading facility  
In case an assessment at Week 16 has been evaluated as “invalid ” by the independent 
central reading facility, it will not be included in the analysis and i t will be handled as

 • Premature study treatment discontinuation before Week 16  
Premature study treatment discontinuation prior to Week 16  will be addressed by a 
“treatment- policy ” estimand strategy by including any assessment in the Week 16 time 
window, irrespective of premature study treatment discontinuation, in the main analysis. 
Population- level summary measure : difference in change in peak VO
2 from baseline to 
Week  16 between macitentan 10 mg and placebo, as estimated from the ANCOVA model 
including randomized treatment group, geographical region and baseline peak VO 2 as 
covariates in the model.  
Based on the inverse normal com bination of the stagewise test statistics to control for the 
adaptive design, the main estimator at final analysis will be the median unbiased estimator for the overall treatment effect and corresponding repeated confidence intervals ( RCIs ) 
based on the stage- wise ordering [ see Section 10.3.2.3] . 
10.3.2.2 Handling of missing data 
The primary variable is the change in peak  VO
2 from Baseline (Visit  2) to Week  16 
(Visit 4) and cal culated as the Week  16 value minus baseline value in peak VO 2. 
At baseline , no subject will have  a missing value  for peak VO 2 because the subject will not 
be able to be randomized via IRT  in the event of missing peak VO 2. In case a subject has 
been randomized with a non- missing baseline value that has subsequently been evaluated 
as “invalid” by the independent central reading facility, it will be imputed with the median 
peak VO 2 value observed at baseline from the remaining subjects (across treatment 
groups). During the conduct of the study, all efforts will be made to avoid missing values in peak  VO
2 at Week  16. For Week  16, the time window interval is from study Day  99 
(Week  14) to study Day 168 (Week 24).  
Furthermore, if a subject discontinues treatment prematurely, a CPET will be conducted 
within 7  days of EOT. If treatment is discontinued prior to Week  16, and the subject enters 
the PTOP, it is requested that the subject return for a CPET assessment at Week  16 (in 
addition to the EOT assessment ). 
Any unscheduled visit will also be mapped to a time window. Intercurrent events as defined in Section 10.3.2.1 will be h andled as in table below as well 
as any other missing values which may occur in peak VO
2 at Week 16 .

 Reason  Strategy in handling the change from Baseline to Week 16  
Death before 
Week 16  Imputed with the lowest observed change in peak VO 2 from Baseline 
to Week 16 (across both treatment groups) – Worst case.  
Invalid peak 
VO 2 at Week 
16/Other * Imputed with the 25th percentile of the observed changes in peak VO 2 
from baseline to Week 16 (across both treatment groups). If this leads to an improvement, a change of 0 (no change) will be imputed. 
*Other could include: premature study treatment discontinuation because of an adverse event, lack of efficacy, or lost -to 
follow up . 
After the imputation is applied, the ANCOVA model , as described in Section  10.3.2.1, will 
be used. 10.3.2.3 Main analysis 
The primary statistical analysis will be performed on the FAS population using the model described in Section  10.3.2.1 for the 16- week change in peak  VO
2 as a dependent variable. 
The ANCOVA model considers study treatment (macitentan 10 mg or placebo) and 
geographical region  as fixed categorical  factors and the baseline value of peak VO 2 as a 
fixed continuous covariate. Missing data will be imputed as described in Section  10.3.2.2  
for the main analysis.  Geographical r egions are defined as Americas, Europe, Asia, 
Oceani a.  
Assumptions of normality  and homogeneity of variance and assessing of ANCOVA model 
assumptions will be investigated and graphically presented when applicable (e.g. , Q-Q and 
residual plots).  
At final analysis, t he primary efficacy endpoint will be teste d by combining the p- values 
from the main ANCOVA analysis of first -stage (based on actual number of subjects 
available at the time of IA)  and second -stage (based on the remaining number of subjects 
to reach the total sample size after  IA results) , using the weighted inverse -normal 
combination method [ Lehmacher  1999] with fixed weights  proportional to the information 
available at the time of the IA . The difference in the change in peak VO 2 from B aseline to 
Week 16  between macitentan 10 mg and placebo and corresponding p- value will be 
estimated at each stage separately (first -stage and second -stage) from the main ANCOVA 
model using a population -wise splitting of data approach. Final interpretation of the results 
will then be based on the final adjusted p -value , median unbiased estimator for the overall 
treatment effect and corresponding RCIs  obtained by ADDPLAN™ 6.1 (ADDPLAN, Inc., 
an Aptiv Solutions company).

 Absolute values at B aseline and at Week 16 as well as absolute change in peak VO 2 from 
Baseline to  Week 16  (for observed and imputed values)  will also be summarized using 
descriptive statistics.  10.3.2.4 Supportive/sensitivity analyses  
i) Sensitivity analyse s for missing values at Baseline and Week  16 in peak VO
2 
• The main  ANCOVA model will be applie d on the set of subjects with observed values 
only, i.e., without replacing missing values.  
• The main ANCOVA model will be applied  excluding subjects with invalid peak VO 2 
at Baseline. 
The resulting least square (LS) mean s and corresponding 95% and 99% CLs obtained in 
each treatment group, and the LS -means differences (95% and 99% CLs) for macitentan 
10 mg vs placebo will be obtained from the ANCOVA model carried out on the total 
sample size (without the population wise spl itting approach for the control of the adaptive 
design).  ii) Other sensitivity analyses  
Other sensitivity analyses carried out on the total sample size, without the population- wise 
splitting approach for the control of the adaptive design, are:  
• ANCOVA mo del applied for the PPS population 
• ANCOVA model following while ‘on-treatment’ strategy. T he assessments in the 
Week  16 time window will only be included in the analysis if assessed  up to 7 days 
after last dose of study treatment.  
• A first ANCOVA on ranks  will be implemented to address possible deviations from 
the normality assumptions. It will be performed as follows:  
– imputation  approach for Week  16 will be applied as per the primary endpoint 
analysis 
– ranking will be performed on the primary variable (changes in peak VO
2 from 
baseline to Week  16) and baseline peak VO 2 
• A second ANCOVA on ranks will be implemented as a sensitivity to the primary imputation method. It will be performed as follows:  
– Each Week 16 value that is missing due to the pa tient’ s death prior to the Week 
16 assessment receives a rank score corresponding to a value of the measurement that is worse than any actually observed 
– Each Week 16 value that is missing in patients not known to have died prior to the Week 16 assessment receives a rank score corresponding to a value of the

 measurement that is worse than any actually observed but better than for any patient who died prior to Week 16 
– The above imputation guarantees the following: 
– rank 
(subjects who die)  < rank (subjects with  missing values)  < rank (subjects without missing values)  
• ANCOVA model with treatment-by-geographical region  interaction effect added  to the 
primary model proposed in S ection  10.3.4.2, 
• ANCOVA model with NYHA FC added to the primary model proposed in the 
Section  10.3.2.1. 
Further details and potential further supportive analyses will be described in the SAP.  
10.3.3 Analysis of secondary efficacy variables 
10.3.3.1 Change from baseline over 52 weeks in peak VO 2 
The change in peak VO 2 over 52 weeks is evaluated on the FAS population with the use of 
a mixed model  repeated measures. The model will include randomized treatment group, 
time (via a categorical variable for visit), treatment -by-time interaction, baseline- by-time 
interaction and peak VO 2 at Baseline as fixed effects. An unstructured variance- covariance 
matrix will be specified.  
Invalid peak VO 2 at B aseline will be handled similarly to the primary efficacy endpoint. 
In case of missing values in peak VO 2 at Week  52 the following approach for imputation 
will be applied  
• Death occurring before Week 52.  
In case of death prior to Week 52, all scheduled assessments following the date of death will be imputed by a worst -case imputation (i.e., lowest observed ch ange in peak VO
2 
from B aseline value across both treatment groups and over all assessments).  
• Peak VO 2 at Week 16 or Week 52 assessed as ‘ invalid ’ by the central reading 
facility.  
In case an assessment at Week 52 has been evaluated as “invalid ” by the independent 
central reading facility, it will be ignored. This will result in imputing the change from Baseline to Week 52 with the 25
th percentile of the observed changes in peak VO 2 from 
Baseline value (across both treatment groups  and over all assessments). If this leads to 
an improvement, a change of 0 (no change) will be imputed. • Premature study treatment discontinuation before Week 52

 o if a valid assessment is available within the tim e window of Week 16, this 
will result in imputing only the change from B aseline to Week 52 with the 
25th percentile of the observed changes in peak VO 2 from Baseline value  
(across both treatment groups  and over all assessments). If this leads to an 
improvement, a change of 0 (no change) will be imputed. 
o if no valid assessment is available within the time window of Week 16 , all 
scheduled assessments following the date of event will be imputed by applying the 25
th percentile of the observed changes in peak VO 2 from 
Baseline value (across both treatment groups  and over all assessments). If 
this leads to an improvement, a change of 0 (no change) will be imputed.  
If the premature study treatment discontinuation occurs after Week 16 and before Week 52 (and no valid assessment is available within the time window of Week 52 ), this will 
result in imputing the change from baseline to Week 52 with the 25
th percentile of the 
observed changes in peak VO 2 from Baseline value  (across both treatment groups  and 
over a ll assessments). If this leads to an improvement, a change of 0 (no change) will 
be imputed .  
Missing data arising from any other reason (e.g., administrative reason) are assumed to be missing at random, and as such, will require no further imputation, sin ce the MMRM 
approach will implicitly impute these values.  Supportive/Sensitivity Analyses:  
Additional sensitivity analyses will be similar to the primary endpoint (e.g., PPS, excluding 
subjects with invalid peak V O
2 at baseline and “while on treatment ”. For all sensitivity 
analyses, similar to the primary endpoint, the main MMRM  model will be carried out on 
the total sample size  (without the population wise splitting approach for the control of the 
adaptive design) . At Week 52, the resulting LS means and corresponding 95% and 99% 
CLs obtained in each treatment group, and the LS -means differences (95% and 99% CLs) 
for macitentan 10 mg vs placebo will be provided. 10.3.3.2 Change from Baseline to Week  16 in mean count per minute of daily PA -Ac 
The change from Baseline to Week  16 in mean count per minute of daily PA -Ac is 
evaluated  on the FAS population by means of an ANCOVA including treatment group and 
baseline accelerometry value as covariates. Similar to the approach for the primary endpoint (main analyses) and b ased on the inverse normal combination of the stagewise 
test statistics to control for the adaptive design, the main estimator at final analysis will be the median unbiased estimator for the overall treatment effect and corresponding 99% confidence intervals based on the stage- wise ordering .

Additional sensitivi ty analyses will be on the PPS, based on observed cases. 
The main model for all sensitivity analyses will be the  same ANCOVA model as specified 
for the primary endpoint but carried out on the total sample size (without the population wise splitting approach for the control of the adaptive design).
 
10.3.3.3 Sub-group analyses 
In order to assess the consistency of the treatment effect across different subject subgroups, 
analyses will be performed on the primary and secondary efficacy variables classifying subjects acc ording to relevant demographic characteristics.  
The subgroups to be considered are: 
• Age group (adults of 18 years of age or more, adolescents of less than 18  years of age  
at Screening ), 
• Geographical region ( America, Europe, Asia, Oceania ), 
• Region (US, non- US), 
• Ventricular dominance: left ventricle  (LV) versus right ventricle  (RV)  / mixed . 
 
Analyses in subgroups on the FAS population are carried out the same way as on the entire population as described in S ections 10.3.2, 10.3.3.1, and 10.3.3.2 for primary and 
secondary efficacy variables, respectively. The t reatment effect within subgroups will 
primarily be displayed with their corresponding 95% CLs and presented in a forest plot.  
An additional forest plot will be produced for the primary endpoint only, displaying 99% 
CLs instead of 95% CLs. Treatment -by-subgroup interaction is investigated by means of 
tests of heterogeneity.

AEs will be coded using the latest available version of the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activitie s (MedDRA
) dictionary. 
Listings will be provided for all reported AEs, including SAEs. Treatment- emergent AEs 
are flagged. In addition, separate listings will be provided for SAEs, for AEs leading to premature discontinuation of study treatment, and for A Es with fatal outcome.  
The number and percentage of subjects experiencing treatment -emergent AEs, SAEs, 
related AEs, related SAEs, AEs with fatal outcome, and AEs leading to premature discontinuation of study treatment will be tabulated by treatment group, system organ class (SOC) and individual preferred term within each SOC, in descending order of incidence within the macitentan 10  mg treatment group. For SAEs, the number of such events is 
added to the table. In addition, tabulation will be by treatment group and individual preferred term, irrespective of SOC, in descending order of incidence within the macitentan 10 mg treatment group. Furthermore, treatment -emergent AEs will be tabulated by treatment group, individual 
preferred term and maximum intensity. The number and percentage of subjects experiencing treatment -emergent non- serious AEs, 
together with the number of such events, will be tabulated by treatment group, SOC and individual preferred term within each SOC, in descending order of incidence within the macitentan 10  mg treatment group, if the frequency of subjects exceeds 5% in any 
treatment group.  
10.3.4.2 Laboratory data 
All laboratory data, local and central, are listed in original, International System of Units 
(SI) and conventional units . Abnormal values and values representing treatment -emergent 
marked abnormalit ies are flagged. Measured values and changes in laboratory data from 
baseline are described by visit and treatment group by means of summary tables in SI units. All recorded assessments, including scheduled and unscheduled visits, will be assigned to the most appropriate visit time point according to the best- fitting time window for the 
assessment. In addition, worst low, worst high and last values post baseline will be described in the same way. Treatment -emergent marked laboratory abnormalities will be summarized for each 
laboratory parameter by treatment group providing their incidence and frequency . In 
addition, shift tables of categories of marked laboratory abnormalit ies at baseline versus

< 30 mL/min/1.73m2. 
• Proportion of patients with treatment- emergent albumin abnormalities <  30 g/L in 
combination with total protein < 5 0 g/L. 
10.3.4.3 Vital signs  
Listings will provide all data of vital signs, including SpO 2, height and body weight. 
Measured values and changes from baseline are described by visit and treatment group by means of summary tables.  Number of subjects  with systolic BP drops to < 90 mmHg (<  85 mmHg for  subjects 
< 18 years old and  < 150 cm of height) over 52 weeks will be tabulated and listed . 
All recorded assessments, including scheduled and unscheduled visits, will be assigned to the most appropriate visit time point according to the best- fitting time window for the 
assessment.  
10.3.4.4 Echocardiography 
Listings will provide data of ECHOC parameters at Screening and EOT visits, together with the respective changes from baseline.

predicted peak VO 2 
Other e fficacy variables related to exercise capacity are summariz ed by treatment groups 
in tabular forms.  Changes from baseline in peak  VO
2 at Week  52 will be analyzed by means of an ANCOVA  
including treatment group and baseline value as covariates.  
Separate receiver operating characteristic curve analysis will be performed in order  to 
identify the best cut -offs of VE/VCO 2 slope and peak VO 2 that discriminate patients with 
and without clinical events. In addition, the variables VE/VCO 2 slope and peak VO 2 will 
be categorized and the number and proportion of patients with clinical events will be presented overall and by treatment group for each category. The % predicted peak  VO
2 will be analyzed  using  a MMRM  [Section  10.3.3.1]  on the 
changes from B aseline over 52 weeks . 
Changes from baseline to Week 16 in  VO 2 at VAT and in  OUES will be analyzed by means 
of an ANCOVA, including treatment group and baseline value as covariates.  In addition, the VO
2 at VAT and OUES will be analyzed using a MMRM [Section  10.3.3.1] 
on the changes f rom Baseline  over 52  weeks.  
If normal assumptions are not valid then ANCOVA on the transformed variable or 
ANCOVA on ranks will be applied. 10.3.5.2 NT-proBNP  
The percent of baseline at Week  16 in NT -proBNP will be analyzed like the primary 
efficacy variable by means of an ANCOVA model as described in Section  10.3.2.1.  
NT-proBNP is assumed to follow a log- normal distribution. Therefore, data is 
log transformed before analysis. Summary tables provide back transformed data by means of geometric means and 95 % CL of NT -proBNP expressed as percent of baseline. 
Back -transformation is done by means of the exponential function of the least -squares 
mean of treatment difference and its corresponding CLs obtained on the log scale.  NT-proBNP at other visits than Week  16 will be summarized and presented graphically 
over time.

will be described at each time point of assessment by calculating for each treatment group the average time spent in each category and will be displayed in both a graphical (bar plots) and a tabular form.  The number of subjects who spent time in physical activity categories 
as defined above will be summariz ed in shift tables (categories at Baseline vs categories at 
post- baseline visits) . 
Repeated measure statistical methodology (a random coeff icient regression model) that 
was proposed for the secondary endpoint  [Section  10.3.3.1]  will also be applied for change 
from Baseline (Visit 2) over 52 weeks in mean count per minute of daily PA- Ac.  
In addition, the number of valid  days of wearing the accel erometer at Baseline, Week  16, 
and Week  52, will also be summarized descriptively. 
10.3.5.4 Clinical events  
Time to clinical events will be analyzed using KM  estimates along with 95% 
two-sided  CLs at relevant time  points for each treatment group in both graphical and 
tabular form. The estimated hazard ratio and corresponding 95%  confidence interval will 
be obtai ned from a Cox regression model. In addition, the number of subjects with event s, 
the number of subjects at risk, and the number of subjects censored will be computed at each time point for each group. Subjects without events will be right- censored at the last 
time known to be without the respective event. 10.3.6 Overall survival 
Time to death up to SCL  will be analyzed using the KM methodology as described in 
Sections 10.2.3 and 10.3.5.4 for the c linical events.  
KM curves over time by treatment group will be graphically displayed. The number of subjects at risk, number of events (deaths) , number of censored cases, KM estimate of the 
event- free rate at these  time points, and corresponding confidence intervals for the 
estimated event -free rate at Weeks 16, and 52 will be presented. Additionally, a listing with 
all subjects and their vital status with corresponding date of death or censoring date will be 
provided. 10.3.7 Analysis of quality of life variables  
The QoL  endpoints will be analyzed descriptively on the FAS by randomized treatment 
group. Continuous scales (EQ -5D VAS) will be s ummarized as absolute and changes from 
baseline values at each time point. Categorical scales (PGA -S, CGI -S, PGI -C, CGI -C and 
EQ-5D- 5L) will be summarized as the proportion of patients within each response category 
at each time point.

Analysis of PK (i.e., trough concentration of macitentan and active metabolite) will be conducted on the PKS.  Individual subject listings of trough plasma concentrations will be provided. 
Trough plasma concentrations of macitentan and its metabolite will be describ ed by visit 
by mean s of summary tables. In addition, separate summary tables will be given by age 
group and by gender.  10.3.10 Exposure to and compliance with the study treatment  
Exposure to study drug will be described in terms of duration and dose. The duration of study treatment  is defined as the time in days elapsing between start and end of study 
treatment, inclusive. It includes potential periods of study treatment interruption. The end of study treatment is defined as the time of permanent discontinuation of study treatment . 
The duration of exposure in days is defined as the number of days with study treatment, excluding days without study treatment, i.e., excluding periods of study treatment interruption. Compliance with study treatment , in percent, is defined as percent of doses taken divided 
by expected number of doses . The expected number of doses  is derived from the planned 
duration of study treatment  during the period of interest . 
Analysis of study treatment exposure and compliance data is performed on the SS. Individual subject listings of study treatment exposure and compliance data will be  
provided. The duration of exposure, the duration of study treatment, and compliance will be describ ed 
by treatment group by means of summary tables . It will be also summarized as a categorical 
variable: the cumulative distribution of exposure time by diff erent class intervals (i.e., at 
least 4  weeks, at least 8  weeks, at least 16  weeks, and so on up to 52 weeks) will be 
tabulated to show counts and percentages of subjects in each class interval.  The sum of 
duration of exposure across all subjects in years will be displayed as subject year exposure.

AEs.  
10.3.12 Subject disposition  
A study flowchart will show the disposition of study subjects throughout the progression of the study. It will display the numbers of subjects screened and undergoing randomization with the latter divided into the placebo and macitentan 10 mg treatment groups to which 
they were randomized. The number of subjects by treatment group continuing and discontinuing treatment and the study, along with reasons for discontinuations will be 
displayed. The final row of the flowchart will result in the number of subjects completing the study in each treatment group. The items in the flowchart will be supported by tables and listings on the FAS related to 
each level and will be presented by randomized treatment group. In addition, it will be presented by geographical region, country and age group. The number and percent of  subjec ts included in and excluded from each analysis set, based 
on the set definitions in Section  10.1,  will be summarized, supported by a summary table 
of protocol deviations leading to exclusion from FAS (i .e., used for derivation of PPS).  
Protocol deviations will be displayed by treatment, geographical region, country and site. 
10.4 Interim analys is 
One IA for unblinded sample size re -estimation will be implemented through an IDMC. 
Only the IDMC and the ISAC /SSG  will be unblinded to the data. 
The IA will be conducted by the ISAC /SSG  on the primary efficacy endpoint to allow 
unblinded sample size re -estimation  when approximately  the first 95 subjects i.e., 70% of 
pre-planned sample size) are randomized and have completed their Week  16 CPET 
assessment (i.e., Visit  4/Week  16), or withdrew from the study without a Week 16 CPET 
assessment. The ISAC /SSG  will make unblinded results available to the IDMC. The IDMC 
will review the interim results and make corresponding recommendation to the Sponsor Committee in line with the IDMC charter. The IDMC may recommend, based on the

 unblinded interim data, that the  sponsor continues the study as initially planned (i.e., a total 
of 134 subjects) or with reassessed sample size, to a total between 134  < N ≤  268 subjects.  
Under the IDMC recommendation  of sample  size adaptation, t he sample size will be 
re-estimated at  the IA based on treatment effect and variability  for the primary efficacy 
endpoint (i.e., change from baseline to Week 16 in peak VO 2), following rules as described 
in the SAP . Only an upward adjustment of the initially planned sample size  is allowed. An 
upper bound of the sample -size adjustment is considered up to a 100% increase of the 
initially planned sample size (i.e. , total sample size of 268 subjects).   
Detailed guidelines for interim decision -making are further described in the SAP  written 
by Actelion for the ISAC /SSG  [see Section  10.5.3, for preliminary details], outlining the 
statistical methods and analyses to be applied to the primary efficacy endpoint  for the 
sample size re- estimation . 
10.5 Sample size  
The sample size is based on the primary efficacy endpoint, the 16 -week change from 
baseline in peak  VO 2. The study is powered for the treatment comparison on a FAS . The 
aim of the trial is to reject the statistical hypothesis of no treatment difference.  
All calculations were performed using the East software version 6.3.  10.5.1 Sample size and justification  
Assuming that the macitentan versus placebo difference is expected to be no worse than the bosentan versus placebo difference, a 2.4 mL/kg/min difference of macitentan to 
placebo on the change in peak  VO
2 is hypothesized. The variation of macitentan  is assumed 
to be greater than that observed in the TEMPO study of bosentan versus placebo in subjects 
with Fontan- palliated circulation  [Hebert  2013, Hebert  2014], namely a standard deviation 
of 4.0 mL/kg/min yielding an effect size of 0.6.  
It is further assumed that all randomized subjects are evaluable . The family -wise two -sided 
Type I error is set to 1% (i.e. , the level of significance), and the minimum statistical power 
to achieve is set to 80% (i.e. , Type II error β of 20%).  
Under the assumption of normal distributions (based on a two-sample t -test with equal 
unknown variances), sample size is determined for different scenarios. Data will be 
analyzed by means of ANCOVA taking further explanatory potentially confounding factors into account, therefore adjusting for the estimated treatment difference and reducing 
variability in the data. If the assumptions are not met, it is only a slight acceptable loss in efficiency.   
Based on the above assumptions and w ith a 1:1 randomization ratio, a total of 134 subjects, 
i.e., 67 per treatment group, are required to establish superiority of macitentan 10 mg over

 placebo to correctly reject the null hypothesis, when it is false, in favor of the alternative hypothesis.  10.5.2 Sample size sensitivity  
In a range of effect size from 0.4 to 0.8, here corresponding to a range of SD  from 3.0 to 
6.0 mL/kg/min for the primary efficacy endpoint, the 16- week change from baseline in 
peak  VO
2, alternative sample size scenarios are given in  Table 4.

10.5.3 Unblinded s ample size re- estimation  
The sample size will be re -estimated at the IA  [see S ection  10.4] based on conditional 
power considerations under the observed unblinded treatment effect  estimates. Sample size 
may be increased to a maximum of 268 subjects to target 80% conditional power. If  the 
conditional power at the IA is below 5% or is above 80%, the sample size shall not be changed.   The detailed methodology for sample size re- estimation as well as the operating 
characteristics of the design under a range of effect sizes are described in the SAP.  
11 DATA HANDLING  
11.1 Data collection  
The investigator/delegate is responsible for ensuring the accuracy, completeness and timelines of the data reported. All source documents should be completed in a neat, legible

 manner to ensure accurate interpreta tion of the data. Data reported in the e CRF derived 
from source documents must be consistent with the source documents.  
eCRF data will be captured via electronic data capture (EDC; using the Rave system 
provided by Medidata Solutions, Inc , a web -based tool ). The investigator and site personnel 
will be trained to enter and edit the data via a secure network, with secure access features (username, password, and identification – an electronic password system). A complete 
electronic audit trail will be maintain ed. The investigator/delegate will approve the data 
(i.e., confirm the accuracy of the data recorded) using an electronic signature (ref. to US 21 CFR Part  11). 
Subject screening and e nrollment data will be completed for all subjects (i.e., eligible and 
non-eligible) through the IRT system and e CRF.  
For each subject enrolled, regardless of study treatment initiation, a n eCRF must be 
completed and signed by the investigator/delegate. This also applies to those subjects who fail to complete the study. If a su bject withdraws from the study, the reason must be noted 
on the e CRF.  Refer to Section  7.2.1 for the data to be collected in the eCRF for subjects 
who failed screening. 
11.2 Maintenance of data confidentiality  
The investigator/delegate must ensure that data confidentiality is maintained. On e CRFs or 
other documents (e.g., documents attached to SAE for ms / Pregnancy forms) submitted to 
Actelion and any CROs, subjects must be identified only by number  and never by their 
name or initials, hospital numbers, or any other identifier. The investigator/delegate must keep a subject identification code list at t he site, showing the screening/randomization 
number, the subject ’s name, date of birth, and address or any other locally accepted 
identifiers. Documents identifying the subjects (e.g., signed ICFs) must not be sent to 
Actelion, and must be kept in strict c onfidence by the investigator/delegate. 
11.3 Database management and quality control  
eCRFs will be used for all subjects. The investigators will have access to the site eCRF 
data until the database is closed. Thereafter, they will have read -only access. The e CRF 
must be kept current to reflect subject status at any time  point during the course of the 
study. While entering the data, the investigator/delegate will be instantly alerted to data queries by validated programmed checks. Additional data review will be performed by Actelion personnel on an ongoing basis to look for unexpected patterns in data and for study monitoring. If discrepant data are detected, a query specifying the problem and requesting clarification will be issued and visible to the investigator/delegate via the e CRF. All 
electronic queries visible in the system either require a data correction (when applicable)

 and a response from the investigator/delegate to clarify the queried data directly in the eCRF, or simply a data correction in the e CRF.  The investigator/delegate must, on request, 
supply Actelion with any required background data from the study documentation or clinical records. This is particularly important when errors in data transcription are suspected. In the case of  health author ity queries, it is also necessary to have access to the 
complete study records, provided that subject confidentiality is protected.  
This process will continue until database closure.  
Laboratory samples will be processed through a central laboratory and the re sults will be 
electronically sent to Actelion.  PK samples will be shipped at regular intervals and 
analyzed by the bioanalytical lab . 
CPET and PA -Ac data are processed by a central reading facility and results will be sent 
to Actelion. AEs are coded accord ing to the latest MedDRA used by Actelion. 
After the database has been declared complete and accurate, the database will be closed. Any changes to the database after that time may only be made as described in the appropriate Actelion QS docs. After databa se closure, the investigator will receive the 
eCRFs of the subjects of his/her site (including all data changes made) on electronic media 
or as a paper copy.  
12 PROCEDURES AND GOOD CLINICAL PRACTICE 
12.1 Ethics and Good Clinical Practice  
Actelion personnel and the  investigators will ensure that the study is conducted in full 
compliance with ICH -GCP g uidelines, the principles of the “ Declaration of Helsinki” , and

 made to obtain this information along with an explanation as to why it cannot be obtained or disclosed must be documented in the study documentation.  If a member of the study personnel was present during an IEC/IRB meeting, it must be 
clear that this person did not vote. 
12.3 Informed consent  
Pediatric subjects are legally unable to provide informed consent. Therefore, full informed consent must be obtained from parent(s) or a legally designa ted representative.  
Assent must be obtained from study participants who are developmentally capable. The criteria for developmental capability to give assent follows local requirements. Distinct assent forms are provided per age categories. Subjects who co me of age during their study 
participation must be consented to continue their participation in the study. The age when subjects are considered capable to give informed consent must follow local regulations. It is the responsibility of the investigator/delegate to obtain informed consent according to ICH- GCP and Declaration of Helsinki guidelines and local regulations from each 
individual participating in this study and/or legally designated representative. The investigator/delegate must explain to subjects  that they are completely free to refuse to 
enter the study, or to voluntarily withdraw from the study at any time for any reason without having to provide any justification. Special attention shall be paid to the information needs of specific subject popu lations and of individual subjects, as well as to the methods used 
to give the information. Adequate time shall be given for the subject and/or legally designated representative to consider his or her decision to participate in the study and it shall be verified that the subject has understood the information (e.g., by asking the subject to explain what is going to happen). The ICF will be provided in the country local language(s). Site personnel authorized (according to local regulation) to  participate in the consent 
process and/or to obtain consent from the subject and/or legally designated representative will be listed on the Delegation of Authority form supplied by Actelion. In European countries the informed consent must be obtained by a physician. A study physician must 
always be involved in the consent process.  
The subject and/or legally designated representative  and authorized site personnel listed on 
the Delegation of Authority form supplied by Actelion must sign, personally date, and time 
(if the first study -mandated procedure is to be performed on the same day informed consent 
is obtained) the ICF before any s tudy- related procedures (i.e., any procedures required by 
the protocol) begin.

 A copy of the signed and dated ICF is given to the subject and/or legally designated representative; the original is filed in the site documentation. The informed consent proce ss 
must be fully documented in the subject ’s medical records. This must include at a minimum 
the study reference, the subject number, the date and, if applicable, time when the subject was first introduced to the study, the date and, if applicable, time of  consent, who 
participated in the consent discussion, who consented the subject, and any additional third 
party (e.g., legally designated representative, impartial witness) present during the consent 
process ( relationship with the subject), and the information that a copy of the signed ICF 
was given to the subject / third party (e.g. , legally designated representative, impartial 
witness) . 
If the site intends to recruit subjects who are considered as vulnerable (e.g., subject cannot read or write, does not speak or understand the ICF language), additional measures must be implemented in order to ensure subject ’s rights are respected and the consent obtained 
is legally valid. Actelion, the regulatory authorities (if applicable), and the IEC/IRB must 
be informe d prior to the recruitm ent. The consent process (e.g.,  involvement of an impartial 
witness) must be fully described, submitted to, and approved by the IEC/IRB, according to procedures and before subjects are recruited.  
12.4 Indemnification, c ompensation and refund of expenses  to subjects and 
investigators  
Actelion provides insurance in order to indemnify (with both legal and financial coverage) the investigator/site against claims arising from the study, except for claims that arise from malpractice and/or negli gence.  
The indemnification  of the subject in the event of study -related injuries will comply with 
applicable regulations. Study subjects will be reimbursed for the study -related expenses 
(e.g., travel costs, meals, hotel) and may be offered financial com pensation for their 
participation in the study only to the extent permitted by applicable local regulations. 
12.5 Protocol adherence/compliance  
The investigator must conduct the study in compliance with the IEC/IRB and/or the regulatory authority- approved version of the protocol and must not implement any 
deviation/change from the protocol, except when deviation is necessary to eliminate an immediate hazard to the subject.  
If a protocol deviation occurs, the investigator/delegate will inform Actelion or its representative in a timely manner. The investigator/delegate must document and explain 
any deviation from the approved protocol. Deviations considered to be a violation of ICH- GCP must be reported to the IEC/IRB and regulatory authorities according to Actelion  
or (overruling) local requirements.

 All protocol deviations will be reported in the clinical study report (CSR) . IECs/IRBs will 
be provided with listings of protocol deviations as per local requirements. 
12.6 Protocol amendments  
Any change to the protocol can only be made through a written protocol amendment. An amended protocol must be submitted to the IEC/IRB and regulatory authorities, according to their requirements.  
12.7 Essential documents and retention of documents  
The investigator/delegate must maintain adequate records necessary for the reconstruction and evaluation of the study. A number of attributes are considered of universal importance to source data and the records that hold those data. These include that the data and records are accurate, legible, con temporaneous, original (or certified copy), attributable, and for 
electronic source data also complete, consistent, enduring, and available when needed. These records are to be classified into two different categories of documents: ISF and subjects’ source documents. These records must be kept by the investigator for as long as is necessary to comply with Actelion ’s requirements (i.e., as specified in the clinical study agreement), and national 
and/or international regulations, whichever would be the longest period. If the investigator cannot guarantee this archiving requirement at the site for any or all of the documents, special arrangements, respecting the data confidentiality, must be made between the investigator and Actelion to store these documents outside the site, so that they can be retrieved in case of a regulatory inspection. No study document should be destroyed without prior written approval from Actelion. Should the investigator wish to assign the study records to another party, or move them to another location, Actelion must be notified in advance. If the site is using an electronic/computerized system to store subject medical records, it can be used for the purpose of the clinical study if it is validated (as per 21 CFR Part  11 or 
equivalent standard) and if the CRA has been provided personal , read -only and restricted 
access to study subjects only, to verify consistency between electronic source data and the eCRF during monitoring visits.  
If the site is using an electronic/computerized system to store subject medical records but it could not be confirmed that the system is validated or if the CRA could not be provided access to the system  according to the requirements of Actelion QS documents , the site is 
requested to print the complete set of source data needed for verification by the CRA. The print- outs must be numbered, stapled together with a coversheet, signed and dated by the 
investigator/delegate to confirm that these certified copies are exact copies having the same

 informatio n as the original source data. The printouts will be considered as the official 
clinical study records and must be filed with the subject ’s medical records.  
In order to verify that the process the site uses to prepare certified copies is reliable, the CRA must be able to observe this process and confirm that the comparison of the source 
documents and the certified copy did not reveal inconsistencies. The CRA does not need to verify this process for all data of all subjects but at random and for key data onl y 
(e.g., eligibility criteria, primary and key secondary endpoints)  as per Actelion ’s 
instructions.  
12.8 Monitoring  
Prior to study start, a site initiation visit (SIV) will be performed after the required essential study documents are approved by Actelion. The  study treatment will be shipped to the site 
upon approval of the required essential documents. The PI must ensure that all site personnel involved in the study are present during the SIV and will dedicate enough time to it. Site  Information Tech nology support should also be 
available during the SIV.  
The SIV must be completed before the site can start the screening of study subjects. Following the SIV, a copy of the completed initiation visit report and follow -up letter will 
be provided to the PI and filed in the ISF.  
During the study, the CRA will contact and visit the site regularly and must be permitted, on request, to have access to study facilities and all source documents needed to verify adherence to the protocol and the completeness, consistency, and  accuracy of the data being 
entered in the e CRFs and other protocol -related documents. Actelion monitoring standards 
require full verification that informed consent has been provided, verification of adherence to the inclusion/exclusion criteria, documentation of SAEs, and the recording of the main efficacy, safety, and tolerability endpoints. Additional checks of the consistency of the source data with the e CRFs will be performed according to the study -specific monitoring 
guidelines. The frequency of the monitoring visits will be specified in the monitoring 
guidelines based on subject recruitment rate and critical data- collection times.  
The PI must ensure that the e CRF is completed after a subject ’s visit (site visit or tele phone 
call), and that all request ed subject files (e.g., ICFs, medical notes/charts, other 
documentation verifying the activities conducted for the study) are available for review by the CRA. The required site personnel must be available during monitoring visits and allow adequate time to  meet with the CRA to discuss study -related issues.  
The investigator agrees to cooperate with the CRA(s) to ensure that any issues detected in the course of these monitoring visits are resolved. If the subject is hospitalized or dies in a

 hospital other th an the study site, the investigator is responsible for contacting that hospital 
in order to document the SAE, in accordance with local regulations. A close- out visit will be performed for any initiated site when there are no more active 
subjects and all fo llow-up issues have been resolved. In case a site does not enroll any 
subjects, the close -out visit may be performed prior to study database closure at the 
discretion of Actelion.  
12.9 Investigator Site File  
Each site will be provided with an ISF prior to the SIV. It will contain all the essential documents that are required to be up- to-date and filed at site as per ICH -GCP s ection  8. 
The ISF will include a table of content listing the essential documents. All study -related 
documentation must be maintained in the ISF.  
In some cases, exceptions can be discussed with the CRA regarding the filing of the study documents outside the ISF. It should be clearly documented where each document is filed. This note to file should be present in the specific tab of the document in the ISF.  
The ISF must be stored in a secure and access- restricted area during and after the study. It 
must be kept by the site for as long as needed to comply with any applicable rules and regulations, ICH -GCP, as well as instructions from Actelion. If the site needs to transfer 
the ISF to another location and/or if site facility can no longer store the ISF, the PI must immediately inform Actelion.  
If the PI will change, or if the site will relocate, the CRA must be notified as soon as possible. 
12.10 Audit  
Sponsor’ s quality management  representatives may audit the investigator site (during the 
study or after its completion). The purpose of this visit will be to determine the investigator’ s adherence to ICH -GCP, the protocol, and applicable regulations; adher ence 
to Actelion ’s requirements (e.g., standard operating procedures ) will also be verified. Prior 
to initiating this audit, the investigator will be contacted by Actelion to arrange a time for the audit. The investigator and site personnel must cooperate with the auditor(s) and allow access to 
all study documentation (e.g., subject records) and facilities. 
12.11 Inspections  
Health authorities and/or IEC/IRB may also conduct an inspection of this study (during the 
study or after its completion) at the site.

 Shoul d an inspection be announced by a health authority and/or IEC/IRB, the investigator 
must immediately inform Actelion (usually via the CRA) that such a request has been made.  
The investigator and site personnel must cooperate with inspector(s) and allow acc ess to 
all study documentation (e.g., subject records) and study facilities. 
12.12 Reporting of study results and publication  
Actelion will post the key elements of this protocol and the summary of results on Actelion ’s Clinical Trial Register and within the required timelines on publicly  accessible 
databases (e.g., clinicaltrials.gov, EU database), as required by law and regulation. Study results will be documented in a CSR that will be signed by Actelion representatives and the Coordinating Investigator (or PI for single -center studies).  
In accordance with the Good Publication Practices and ethical practice, the results of the study will be submitted for publication in a peer -reviewed journal. Study results can be 
submitted for presentation at a congress before submission to a peer-reviewed journal. The Coordinating Investigator, if any, will have the opportunity to review the analysis of the data and to discuss the interpretation of the study results with Actelion personnel prior to submission to a peer -reviewed journal or presentation at a congress.  
Authorship will be determined in accordance with the International Committee of Journal Editors criteria, and be based on: • substantial contributions to the conception or design of the study, or the acqui sition, 
analysis, or interpretation of data; and  
• drafting of the publication or critical review for important intellectual content; and  
• providing final approval of the version to be published; and 
• agreement to be accountable for all aspects of the work in ensuring that questions related to the accuracy or integrity of any part of the work are appropriately investigated and resolved.  
The list of authors of any publication of study results may include representatives of Actelion and will be determined by mutual agreement.  
Any study- related publication written independently by investigators must be submitted to 
Actelion for review at least 30  days prior to submission for publication or presentation at a 
congress. Upon review, Actelion  may provide comments, and may also request alterations 
and/or deletions for the sole purpose of protecting its confidential information and/or patent rights. Neither the institution nor the investigator should permit publication during such a review period.

 14 APPENDICES  
Appendix 1 Central laboratory abnormalities and alert flags   
The adult ranges below are valid at the time of protocol finalization. Any changes to these 
ranges during the course of the study will be reflected in the ranges displayed in the laboratory reports sent from the central lab oratory to the investigational sites.  
Laboratory abnormalities 
Laboratory values below or above the normal range will be graded at three levels (H, HH, HHH for values above normal range and L, LL, LLL for values below the normal range) where L stands for “low”, H for “ high”. 
The term “marked abnormality” describes laboratory values with grading of abnormalities 
at two levels: LL/HH and LLL/HHH. These thresholds have been defined by the sponsor in order to flag and/or communicate abnormal laboratory results from the central laboratory to the in vestigators, and for the purpose of standardized data analysis and reporting by the 
sponsor. The definitions of marked abnormal values are based mainly on the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) [CTCAE  2010] grading system and, 
in specific cases (e.g.,  lymphocyte levels), are adjusted based on the known 
pharmacodynamic effect of the study drugs (e.g., LLL threshold for lymphocytes).  The term ALERT here corre sponds to a protocol-defined test result threshold requiring an 
action from the investigator as described in the protocol (e.g., repeat the test; interrupt or discontinue the study drug) and should not be confused with the term “call alert” used by 
the cen tral laboratory for laboratory results, which will be communicated to the 
investigator. Not all ALERTS listed in this table will be “ call alerts ” from the central 
laboratory and vice versa. PLEASE NOTE: Thresholds for abnormality of level L or H are not provided in this appendix but will be provided in the central laboratory manual. Parameters for which no threshold is defined in Table 5 may be defined in the central laboratory manual.

 Appendix 2 Echocardiography  Image optimization  
• Using maximal frequency to increase axial resolution  
• Reducing sector width to area of interest in order to increase frame rate.  
• Reducing depth to increase size of image on the screen.  
• Bringing focus at point of interest to increase lateral resolution  
• Adju sting time gain c ompensation in order to optimize the distribution of gain at 
different penetration depths  
• Optimizing gain and resolution to identify endocardial borders and structures 
2D Biplane Simpson method  
The Simpson method assumes that the ventricle  is cylindrical in shape, which may not 
apply to a univentricular heart. The Simpson method will split the trace of the ventricle into sections from the apex to the mitral valve. The volume of each section is calculated by multiplying the diameter and the thickness of the slice. The volume of each section is then summed to calculate the total left ventricle volume. It is more accurate to carry out a Simpson measurement in two planes (apical 4 chamber and apical 2 chamber). If done in a single plane it is assumed that the ventricle is circular at each level. By carrying out a Simpson measurement in both the apical 4 and 2 chamber views, the cross -sectional area 
of each section can be more accurately measured [Leeson  2012] . 
Apical 1 chamber view  
The apical 1 chamber view is obtained by placing the probe at the apical window , which is 
usually located on the anterior axillary line in the fifth intercostal space. The image obtaine d should show the chambers at their maximum size and clear images of the 
infero -septal and antero -lateral walls with optimized views of the endocardial borders.  
The ventricular diastolic volume is obtained using the Simpson method:  
The end diastolic frame is selected using ECG identification of the R wave.  
The endocardial border is then traced from where the basal systemic ventricle wall meets 
the systemic valve’ s annulus of the septal wall, to where the basal systemic ventricular wall 
meets the systemic v alve’ s annulus of the antero -lateral wall.  
The ventricular systolic volume is obtained using the Simpson method: The end systolic frame is selected using ECG identification of the end of the T wave.

 The endocardial border is then traced from where the basal systemic ventricular wall meets 
the systemic valve’ s annulus of the septal wall, to where the basal systemic ventricular wall 
meets the systemic valve ’s annulus of the antero -lateral wall.  
The stroke volume is the volume of blood ejected from the heart at end- systole. It is 
calculated by:  
• Systemic ventricle diastolic volu me (mL) −  systemic ventricle systolic v olume 
(mL) = stroke volume(mL ) 
The ejection fraction is the percentage change in systemic ventricle volume divided by the initial volume [ Otto 2002] . This is calculated by:  
• (Systemic ventricle diastolic vo lume (mL) − systemic ventricle systolic volume 
(mL))/ systemic ventricle systoli c volume ×  100 = ejection fraction (%)  
The first of the atrial volumes are also measured in this frame using the area length method. 
The border of the atrium is traced starting from the one side of the AV valve annulus, 
following the contour of the atrial wall, and finishing at the other side of the valve annulus.  
Apical 2 chamber v iew 
To obtain the apical 2 chamber view, begin with the apical 1 chamber image. The probe is 
then rotated to around 90 degrees in an anticlockwise direction, just before the left 
ventricular outflow tract is shown. The mitral valve should be kept in the same place and the image shouldn’ t be foreshortened. The image should then be optimized so clear 
endoc ardial borders can be seen.  
The ventricular diastolic volume is obtained using the Simpson method:  
The end diastolic frame is selected using ECG identification of the R wave.  
The endocardial border is then traced from where the basal systemic ventricular wall meets 
the systemic valve ’s annulus of the inferior wall, to where the basal systemic ventricular 
wall meets the systemic valve’ s annulus of the anterior wall.  
The ventricular systolic volume is obtained using the Simpson method: The end systolic frame is selected using ECG identification of the end of the T wave. The endocardial border is then traced from where the basal systemic ventricular wall meets 
the systemic valve’ s annulus of the inferior wall, to where the basal systemic ventricular 
wall meets the systemic valve’ s annulus of the anterior wall.  
The following data will be obtained from this method:

 • Systemic ven tricle diastolic volume (SVDV)  
• Systemic ve ntricle systolic volume (SVSV)  
• Stroke volume (mL)  
• Ejection fraction.  
Those measurements will then form the biplane SVDV, SVSV, stroke volume and ejection fraction results.  The second  of the atrial volumes are also measured in this frame, again using the area 
length method. The border of the atrium is traced starting from the one side of the AV valve 
annulus, following the contour of the atrial wall, and finishing at the other side of the valve annulus.  
Three  Chamber apical view  
The probe is rotated a further 30 degrees anticlockwise beyond the apical 2 chamber  view 
to bring the left ventricular outflow tract into view and to display the anterolateral and anterior walls of the ventricle.  
Cut-off values for valvular defects  
Severe AV valve regurgitation is present where the vena contracta is ≥  7 mm and/ or the 
effective regurgitant orifice is ≥  0.4 cm2. 
Presence of left ventricular outflow obstruction is confirmed by a pulsed -wave Doppler 
velocity >  2.5 m/s.

 Appendix 3 Cardiopulmonary exercise testing  
 
Important instructions:  
These instructions must be followed for the conduct of the study and supersede any local guidelines for conducting cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET). Any deviation from the guideline for the conduct of CPET must be reported to Actelion.   
Conditions should be in line with the protocol. Baseline conditions  (e.g., same device, about the same time of 
the day, etc .) for a patient should apply for subsequent tests as much as possible to minimize variability.  
 
General instructions:  
CPET is to be carried out within the Cardiology Departments or a dedicated research lab of the hospital/clinic.  
 
 
1. Prior to the test, eligibility of the patient for CPET needs to be confirmed (including confirmation of adherence to local safety regulations).  
 2. Staffing  
A minimum of two members of staff are needed for a technician-led CPET , consisting of either:  
• Two qualified cardiac physiologists/physiotherapist s (or local equivalent ).  
• A qualified cardiac physiologist/physiotherapist  (or local equivalent)  and a student who has been 
signed off on exercise testing.  
• A qualified cardiac physiotherapist  (or local equivalent)/supervising cardiologist.  
CPET led by a cardiologist may be performed without additional personnel.  
 
At least one member of staff must have been on a CPET course or have on the job training (leading the 
conduct of 25 or more CPET assessments). The leading member of staff should be at least  intermediate life 
support  trained and the assisting member of staff should be at least be basic life support  certified.  
 3. Equipment  
The following equipment is needed during CPET:  
• Bicycle ergometer  
• Control unit to control the ergometer  
• Electrocardiogram ( ECG ) recording equipment with printer  
• Blood pressure measuring unit and/or manual sphygmomanometer with appropriate cuff sizes  
• Chair  
• Couch/exam table  
• Resuscitation equipment  
• Height measure and scales  
• Calibration gas  
• Masks/mouth pieces and flow meters with associated fittings of various sizes  
• Gas and flow analysis equipment  
• Pulse- oximetry monitor  
 All equipment should be appropriately checked before a test is started; the resuscitation equipment should be 
checked once daily.  
 4. Before a test is started 
The following tasks will need to be completed before a test is started:  
• The gas analysis unit should be allowed a minimum of 30 minutes warm -up time.  
• The temperature, barometric pressure and humidity should be calibrated against the monitor mounted on the control unit.

 5. Before the test  
• The gas analysers and flow meter used for this patient should be calibrated before start  (best practice 
is that this occur within 10 minutes of the start of data collection) . Calibration reports should be printed 
and kept in the site file.  
• The patient ’s data should be entered into the control unit.  
• The patient ’s identity should be confirmed.  
• The patient ’s height and weight should be measured.  
• The patient should be encouraged to ask any questions(s) he might have about the test, which need to be answered as accurately as possible.  
• Explain the rating of the perceived exertion using the Borg scale to the patient.  
• A non-verbal sign for stopping the test  should be agreed upon with the patient.  
• Ensure that the patient wears suitable/non-restrictive clothing for the test (e.g. , no jeans, no sandals, 
not multiple layers of clothing)  
• ECG leads should be attached:  
 Prepare the skin: shave if necessary, remove skin oils with a cleansing solution followed by light 
abrasion. If possible, check that the electrode impedance is as low as  possible.  
 
Do not use baby wipes if the patient has eczema or dry skin as this might damage the skin further and is unlikely to decrease the skin-to-electrode impedance in these patients.  
 
Attach ECG electrodes to the patient ’s skin using the modified Mason-Likar positions. (The 
electrodes normally placed on the extremities should be placed on the torso instead.)  
 
Female patients should be encouraged to wear a brassiere during exercise even if this has been removed to aid electrode positioning.   
 
• A blood pressure cuff should be place on the patient ’s arm making sure that the diaphragm  is 
positioned directly over the brachial artery.  
• A mask should be fitted to the patient ’s face, making sure there are no leaks between the patient ’s 
skin and the mask. The calibrated flow meter and the sampling line should be attached to the mask.  
Alternatively, a mouthpiece can be used.  
• A protocol should be chosen based on the patient ’s ability to exercise.  
 6. Data storage (full disclosure) ; keep original test measurements for transfer to central reading facility .

Patient dialogue 
 
 Patient Consent  
 Ensure written patient consent has been obtained before testing. 
The reason for the CPET should be clearly explained, including the risks and benefits of the test.  
The patient should be told that they are required to give “ maximal effort ”.  
They should be warned that they may feel discomfort, particularly close to maximal exertion.  It should be explained that the test can be stopped at any time if the patient feels “extreme breathlessness, chest pain, light -headed, or nauseated”. 
 The testing protocol should be briefly outlined to the patient:  
 “This is an exercise test that requires maximal effort. The more effort you put in, the more information we will obtain. The test will begin with a collection of resting measurements, including a breathing test  with no 
pedaling. You will then go into the exercise task  and be asked to pedal at approximately 55–65 rpm. After a 
3-minute warm up, every minute the workload (resistance) will increase with pedaling becoming more difficult until you won’ t be able to continue.”  
 Patient information:  
 “We expect that the test will take 6– 12 minutes. It is usually only hard during the last few minutes when we 
collect the most important data. Throughout the test we want you to pedal between 55–65 rpm. During the 
test we will be taking your blood pressure and monitoring your heart rhythm to make sure it is safe to keep exercising. When the test has finished we want you to ride for another 5 minutes at a very low workload to help your body recover from the exercise. In the 5 minutes of recovery we will take the mask/mouthpiece off 
after 30 seconds but keep on the electrodes to measure heart beat and ECG reactions. ”  
 “If at any stage you feel any major discomfort such as strong chest pain, severe leg pain or nausea, let us know (we will keep checking with you) and we will stop the test. Otherwise, carry on pedaling until your legs 
or breathing prevents you from continuing. We will be asking you to indicate on a scale how short of breath you are and how tired your legs are.”

 Standard operating procedure for a CPET assessment with a bicycle  
 
 1. Physical measurements 
o Height (measure without shoes)  
o Weight (measure without shoes and with light clothing)  
2. CPET on bicycle with ergometry, ECG registration and blood pressure measurement.  
o Connect gas analyser and perform local calibration protocol before every CPET  
o Make sure patient cannot see the amount of Watt during cycling. Rotation per minute ( rpm) 
should be visible.  
3. Test protocol for peak  oxygen uptake (VO
2): 
o Basic spirometry should be performed to measure the Forced Expired Volume over 1 
second (FEV1), which will then be used to calculate breathing reserve.  
o Allow patient to acclimatize for 3 minutes  
o During this time, collect gas exchange data to ensure the patient shows physiologic response.  
o Measure baseline blood pressure and heart rate ( HR) while sitting on the bicycle  
o Cycle for 3 minutes at 10 Watt with a n rpm between 55 –65 
o Optimal test duration 6 –12 minutes  
 Choose individualized continuous RAMP protocol   
RAMP 60 (every minute 6 watt is added)  
 RAMP 90 (every minute 9 watt is added)  
 RAMP 120 (every minute 12 watt is added) 
 Etc. 
o Use the same protocol at every test 
o Start RAMP and let patient cycle between 55 –65 rpm 
Terminate the test when exhausted:   
o Aim to surpass the anaerobic threshold (ventilatory threshold 2/ respiratory compensation 
point  = rise of VE/VCO
2)  
o Aim at RER > 1.1  
o Aim at Borg scale (6 –20) > 17  
4. After termination of the test, let the patient cycle for 5 minutes  at 10 Watt  
o Register reason for test termination and Borg score  
o Register HR after 1 minute ( HR recovery)  
5. Keep original test measurements for transfer to core cent er.  
o Complete the CPET worksheet, and if needed the tabular data report for the core center.  
o Complete the source document for investigational sites with appropriate parameters , 
including resting VO 2, peak VO 2, RER at max, and breathing reserve.  
o Peak  VO 2 = mean of highest 30-sec measurement.

 Borg -RPE- Scale®  Perceived exertion  
 
We want you to rate your perception of exertion, i.e. , how heavy and strenuous the exercise feels 
to you. This is mainly felt as strain and fatigue in your muscles and as breathlessness or possible aches. Try to be as honest as you can. Don’t think about the actual physical load. It is your own feeling of eff ort and exertion that is important. Don ’t underestimate it, but don ’t overestimate it 
either. Look at the scale and the expressions and then give a number. Use whatever numbers you want, also numbers between the expressions.

months.   
It is necessary to document the primary efficacy variable.   
Regular performance of CPET provides a detailed evaluation (including ECGs) of patient’ s improvement 
or deterioration.  Extra burden contributes to 
significant risk reduction by having a more frequent and thorough assessment of the patients ’ exercise capacity.  
QoL questionnaires      
Patient interview (at regular visits)   up to 4 times 2–5 
questions over 14 
months.  = 
Regular discourse on how the condition affects every day life is part of the interview , and 
although frequency is higher,  the number of 
replies is minimal.   
Using a tool to consistently capture QoL at more frequent 
intervals provides a 
granular evaluation of 
patient’ s improvement 
or deterioration.  Using a tool to consistently 
capture QoL across sites and over time will help  establish a 
baseline for the Fontan population in general.

Life-Style recommendations          
Contraception (pregnancies advised 
only in rare cases)  Initial blood 
pregnancy tests.  
Monthly urine tests.  
These tests are needed because macitentan, like all ERAs, is 
teratogenic (teratogenicity is a class effect of ERAs) .

This is to reduce the risk of an undesired pregnancy, which in addition to mitigating the inherently increased risks due to a pregnancy in Fontan-palliated patients, helps reduce the risk of a child ’s congenital 
defects.  Burden is reduced to  a 
minimum and contributes to significant risk reduction by providing frequent confirmation of non -
pregnancy.

subjects)  = 
Regular evaluation at site visits is not more 
constraining than answering a few questions .  
This is to reduce the risk of an undesired pregnancy, while 
ensuring contraceptive measures are only imposed on those who need them . Burden is small as it is a self -

GUIDANCE ON STUDY CONDUCT DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC It is recognized that the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID -19) pandemic may have an impact on 
the conduct of this clinical study due to, for example, self -isolation/quarantine by study 
participants/subjects and study-site personnel; travel restrictions ; limited access to public places, 
including hospitals; study site personnel being reassigned to critical tasks.   
In alignment with recent health authority guidance, the sponsor is providing options for study related subjec t management in the event of disruption to the conduct of the study. This g uidance 
does not supersede any local or government requirements or the clinical judgement of the investigator to protect the health and well-being of subject s and site staff. If, at any time, a subject ’s 
safety is consi dered to be at risk, study intervention will be discontinued, and study follow -up will 
be conducted.  
Scheduled visits that cannot be conducted in-person at the study site will be performed to the extent possible remotely/virtually or delayed until such time that on -site visits can be resumed. At each 
contact, subject s will be interviewed to collect safety data. Key efficacy endpoint assessments 
should be performed if required and as feasible. Subject s will also be questioned regarding general 
health status to fulfill any physical examination requirement.  Every effort should be made to adhere to protocol -specified assessments for subjec ts on study 
intervention, including  follow -up. Modifications to protocol -required assessments may be 
permitted via COVID -19 Appendix after consultation with the subject , investigator, and the 
sponsor.  Missed assessments/visits will be captured in the clinical trial management system for 
protocol deviations. Discontinuations of study interventions and withdrawal from the study should be documented with the prefix “COVID -19-related” in the electronic case report form ( eCRF). 
The sponsor will continue to monitor the conduct and progress of the clinical study, and any changes will be communicated to the sites and to the health authorities according to local guidance. If a subject  has tested positive for COVID -19, the investigator should contact the sponsor ’s 
responsible medical officer to discuss plans for study intervention and follow -up. Modif ications 
made to the study conduct as a result of the COVID -19 pandemic should be summarized in the 
clinical study report.

Status: Approved , Da te: 17 June 2020  GUIDANCE SPECIFIC TO THIS PROTOCOL  Subje ct Visits and Assessments 
If the regular site visit schedule cannot be maintained due to COVID -19-related restrictions, the 
site staff must discuss available options with the subject  (eg, discontinuation of treatment vs 
performing visits by tele phone) and document the decision in the subject ’s chart.  If the decision is 
made to remain in the study, the guidance below is to be followed:  
• General handling of surrogacy for on -site assessments p erformed remotely:  
If a visit is conducted remotely , information on any adverse event , serious adverse event , 
clinical worsening/morbidity event, NYHA functional class , and concomitant medication, as 
well as the EQ -5D-5L questionnaire , should be collected,  and data recorded in the eCRF with 
the actual date of the telephone call documented. Information on physical examinations and 
vital signs may also be reported, if these have been conducted locally.  These will be captured  
in the source notes  and any releva nt abnormalities reported as adverse events . 
• Handling of safety monitoring   
If medical oversight of safety assessments (including but not limited to laboratory values) cannot be performed and reviewed by the investigator, the investigator may decide to interrupt or discontinue study intervention if it is in the best interest of the subject.  
Options for conduct of safety laboratory  assessments are described in protocol section 7.2.4.1 
and include laboratory sample s taken at study site, at a satellite lab oratory , collected via home 
healthcare (HHC) visits service (also known as “ flying nurse service) ”, or taken and analyzed 
locally.  
If in-(subject ) person collection of safety assessments at the investigational study site  is not 
possible , these alternative options continue to be valid.  
For women of childbearing potential, monthly pregnancy tests are required. If a subject cannot 
come to the site, the urine pregnancy tests provided to the site for on-site visits may be shipped (if allowed per local regulatio n) to the subject  for use at home under guidance from the site.  
Laboratory samples  that are missed or delayed due to the COVID -19 pandemic will be 
identified as issues in the clinical trial management system ( CTMS ) as “COVID-19-related  
issue ” and/or as protocol deviations in the Medidata RAVE system (eCRF) as “COVID-19 -
related  protocol deviation ”. 
• Handling of pharmacokinetic (PK) assessments  
Pharmacokinetic (P K) samples that cannot be collected at study site may either be collected 
at a local labor atory or  via HHC . If samples are collected by HHC , a central laboratory kit 
will be used.  Missed PK samples may be collected at another study site visit , provided that 
the subject is still under study treatment.

Status: Approved , Da te: 17 June 2020  • Handling of efficacy assessments  
If subject s cannot have their cardiopulmonary exercise testing ( CPET ) assessments conduct ed 
at the  study site  as expected, these CPET should be done at the earliest possibility during a 
scheduled or unscheduled visit . 
For Week 52, the  CPET  assessment could be  conducted up to 8 weeks  later and as long as 
subject s have not started open-label  treatment.  
If a site visit cannot be conducted , devices for data collection of Physical Activity measured 
by Accelerometer ( PA-Ac) may be shipped to study subjects (and returned to site by them) as 
already described for certain visits in the RUBATO Accelerometry Manual (as applicable to protocol V  7 and V  8). 
CPET or PA -Ac assessments that were missed specifically due to COVID-19 will be identified 
in the CTMS  as “COVID-19-related  issue ” and/or as protocol deviations in the Medidata 
RAVE system (eCRF) as “COVID-19-related  protocol deviation ”.  
• Handling of safety and efficacy data integrity 
The study Independent Data Monitoring Committ ee (IDMC ) will be provided with listings of 
COVID-19-related  protocol deviations and will be asked to evaluate their impact on study 
safety and efficacy outcome s at the next IDMC meeting . 
In parallel, the sponsor will continue to monitor the COVID-19 related  protocol deviations and  
evaluate their impact on study safety and efficacy outcomes . 
Study treatment supply  
• Every effort should be made to keep study subjects on treatment as deemed cli nically 
appropriate.  If a subject  cannot come to the site to receive study treatment, the study treatment 
may be provided via a direct -to-patient shipment to the subject ’s home or distributed to a 
subject ’s relative/caregiver in accordance with local regul ations .  
The subject will be asked to return empty study medications bottles / unused tablets  at their 
next site visit.  Treatment compliance will meanwhile be assessed via monthly phone calls.  
This distribution and shipment of study treatment will be done if the treating physician can  
ensure that they  maintain subjec t safety  oversight  (based on clinical evaluation, results of 
laboratory tests and pregnancy test [if applicable ] as described in the section above “ Handling 
of sa fety monitoring ”). 
Premature discontinuations  from study treatment or from the study due to the COVID -19 pandemic 
will be documented in the Medidata RAVE system (eCRF)  with the reason “COVID-19 -related ”.  
Source Data Verification/Monitoring  
• Site monitoring will, in general,  be limited to remote monitoring until further notice ; however, 
certain regions and countries may continue to have on-site monitoring at this time, as allowed per country COVID -19 guidance/travel res trictions.  The Site Manager will be in contact with 
the study site  to schedule the  next remote or on-site monitoring visit.

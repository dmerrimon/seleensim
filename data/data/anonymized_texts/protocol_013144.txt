Corr ected Clarification Memo randum  Date:  21 July 2021  
 
 
Summary of Clarifications and Rationale  
 
This is a corrected version of Clarification Memorandum (CM)  #2, whic h clarifies pharmaco kinetic (PK)  
specimen collection procedures for participants wh o discon tinue remdesivir (RDV) after initial PK 
sampling.  This CM also updates the Protocol Team Roster . The corrected version of CM#2 replaces the 
original clarification memorandum , which should be disregarded.     
 
 
Implementation  
 
This CM will be submitt ed to th e Johns Hopkins Medicine Institutional Review Board , which serves as 
the single Institutional Review Board (sIRB) for IMPAACT 2032 , for their information ; however , 
approval of this CM is not required by the study sponsor prior to implementation . Sites may submit this 
CM to their local  IRBs/ECs for their inf ormation or, if required by the  local  IRBs/ECs, for their approval 
prior to implementation.  This CM and any applicable IRB/EC correspondence should also be filed in  
essential document files for IM PAACT 20 32. 
 
The information included in this memorandum will be incorporated into the next protocol amendment.   
 
1. Section 6.7 Early Discontinuation of Remdesivir  of the IMPAACT 2032 protocol  specifies that 
participants who initiate  RDV  and undergo PK sampl ing and then discontinue RDV prior  to the 5th  
infusion will have no further  PK sampling. This mem orandum clarifies that PK sampling includes  
intensive  PK, intracel lular PK, protein binding  plasma , or single PK plasma (48-hour post-last 
infusion data collec tion t imepoint ) sampling.   
 
2. To reflect current membership , Polina German  is removed from the Protocol Team Roster  and

A. DAIDS Policy Updates   
 
1. Protocol Section 12 is updated to reflect current DAIDS policies for clinical site monitoring , which 
allow for on -site and remote monitoring. T he prior contents of this section are replaced with the 
following:  
 
Under contract to DAIDS or NICHD, site monitors will inspect study site facilities and review 
participant study records — including informed consent forms, paper -based CRFs (if used), 
eCRFs, medical records, laboratory records, and pharmacy records — to ensure protection of 
study participants, compliance with the  sIRB approved protocol, and accuracy and 
Clarification Memorandum # 1 Page 2 of 3 12 April 2021  
IMPAACT 2032, Protocol Version 2.0 completeness of records. Monitors also will review essential document files to ensure 
compliance with all applicable regulatory requirements. Site investigators will make study 
facilities and documents available for inspection by monitors.  
 
Monitoring visits may be conducted on -site or remotely. Remote vis its may include remote 
source document verification using methods specified for this purpose by DAIDS or NICHD. 
Remote monitoring visits may be performed in place of, or in addition to , onsite visits to ensure 
the safety of study participants and data inte grity (1). Site investigators will make study 
documents available for site monitors to review utilizing a secure platform that is 21 CFR Part 
11 and HIPAA compliant. Potential platform options include: Veeva SiteVault, Medidata Rave 
Imaging Solution, Medid ata Remote Source Review, site -controlled SharePoint or cloud -based 
portal, and direct access to electronic medical records. Other secure platforms that are 21 CFR

 INTRODUCTION  
 
1.1 Background  
 
As of November 23, 2020, Centers  for Disease Control  and Prevention ( CDC ) received 12,175,921 
COVID -19 case reports for the United States ( U)S since January 22, 2020. There were slightly more 
women (52%) than men (48%) included in these reports  (1). The most recent tracking data from CDC 
includes 39,857  case reports  of US pregnant women with COVID -19 received between January 22 and 
November 23, 2020, with 53 deaths and 8,284  hospitalizations, although the se data did not distinguis h 
between hospitalization for COVID -19 conditions from admissions for pregnancy -related indications, 
such as delivery. The ra ce/ethnicity breakdown of the pregnancy COVID -19 cases was 37% Hispanic, 
35% White Non -Hispanic, 19% Black Non -Hispanic, 3%, Asian and 6% Multiple/Other  (2). In an earlier 
MMWR publication describing the p eriod between January 22 and June 7, 2020, CDC reported receiving 
notifications of 326,335 women of reproductive age (15 –44 years) with positive SARS -CoV -2 test 
results. Of the 91,412 of these women with pregnancy data, 9% (8,207) were pregnant. Hospitaliz ation 
was reported in 31.5% of pregnant women compared to 5.8% of nonpregnant women but the data did not 
distinguish between hospitalization for COVID -19 conditions from admissions for pregnancy -related 
indications, such as delivery. After adjusting for ag e, presence of underlying medical conditions, and 
race/ethnicity, pregnant women were significantly more likely to be hospitalized (aRR = 5.4, 95% 
confidence interval [CI] = 5.1 -5.6), to be admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) (aRR = 1.5, 95% CI =  
1.2–1.8) and to receive mechanical ventilation (aRR = 1.7, 95% CI = 1.2 –2.4) than nonpregnant women  
(3). Increased need for intensive care during pregnancy has also been reported in Swedish women with 
COVID -19 (4). A review of published data on severe  coronavirus infections in pregnancy reported 
adverse pregnancy outcomes, including maternal death, preterm delivery, stillbirth and neonatal death, as 
well as respiratory compromise requiring ICU care and mechanical ventilation, in pregnant women with 
COV ID-19, although at lower frequency than with MERS -CoV and SARS -CoV -1 (5).   
 
Despite this reported incidence of severe COVID -19 in pregnant women associated with adverse 
pregnancy and maternal health outcomes, pregnant women are routinely excluded from participation in 
research protocols within COVID -19 drug development programs (6). The physiological changes 
associated with pregnancy can have a dramatic impact on drug disposition and use of therapeutic agents 
during pregnancy poses unique safety concerns (6). As a result, drugs cannot be used safely and 
effectively during pregnancy without their pharmacokinetics (PK) and safety being evaluated in pregnant 
women.  Only a few of the many COVID -19 clinical treatment trials currently listed on clinicaltrials.gov 
include pregnant women (7). Those that do involved use of hydroxychloroquine , which has been used 
extensively in pregnant women for malaria treatment but is no longer recommended for routine use in 
treatment of COVID -19 due to a lack of proven efficacy in the presence of significant risk of major 
toxicity (8). 
 
Remdesivir  (GS-5734TM) (RDV), a nucleotide prodrug originally developed for the treatment of Ebola 
virus disease and Marburg virus infections, is the first drug licensed for use against  COVID -19, the 
disease caused by infection with SARS -CoV -2 virus (9). RDV has been shown to shorten time to recovery 
from severe COVID -19 (10-12). In an activation process analogous to that of tenofovir alafenamide 
(TAF)  and sofosbuvir  (SOF) , RDV  is metabolized to an intracellular nucleotide triphosphate which 
inhibits viral RNA polymerases. Now that RDV is licensed , hospitalized pregnant women with COVID -
19 can receive RDV  part of clinical care ; however,  since all RDV  research protocols exclude d pregnant 
women  there are no RDV pregnancy PK data and only limited RDV  in pregnancy  safety data from 
observational cohorts (13). 
 
The routine exclusion of pregnant women from drug development programs results in therapeutic agents 
typically being licensed for use in non -pregnant adults in the absence of pregnancy specific PK and safety 
IMPAACT 2032, FINAL  Version 2.0    Page  19 of 79  18 December 2020  
 data. As a result, these licensed drugs cannot b e employed with evidence -based certainty as to their safety  
and efficacy in pregnant women  until data are available from the requisite pregnancy PK and safety 
studies , which often  require years to complete . Requisite PK and safety studies require years to complete. 
As an example, it took 3 -5 years after licensure of cobicistat before its failure as an effective booster of 
elvitegravir and darunavir in pregnant women was recognized and warnings against its use in pregna ncy 
were issued, during which time cobicistat was used routinely as part of clinical care for pregnant women 
living with HIV (6). A similar delay in the availability of pregnancy PK and safety data for drugs shown to 
be effective against COVID -19 would be tragic, given the incidence,  acuity and observed severity of 
COVID -19 in pregnant women and the current paucity of proven effective therapies.  
 
1.2 Clinical Pharmacology During Pregnancy  
 
RDV  is the first drug with preliminary evidence of efficacy in COVID -19(14). RDV  is a prodrug that 
requires several steps of metabolism to generate its active intracellular nucleo tide triphosphate (NTP, GS -
443902), following a similar activation sequence as SOF (Figure 2). RDV is a monophosph oramid ate 
prodrug of an adenosine analog that is made 
more lipophilic by the addition of alkyl -alanine 
and phenyl phosphate esters. RDV  is rapidly 
converted by plasma and liver hydrolases to a  
nucleoside analog  monophosphate . Inside cells  
the nucleoside analog mono phosphate is rapidly 
converted to the active triphosphate form (GS -
443902), which competes with natural  
adenosine triphosphate  (ATP) to selectively 
inhibit RNA -dependent RNA polymerase. 
Dephosphorylation of the nucleoside analog 
results in GS -441524, which  is not as efficiently 
rephosphorylated  as RDV . 
 
The in vitro EC50 against SARS -CoV -2 has 
been reported at 0.137 µM (83 ng/mL) and 0.77 µM (460 ng/mL ) in Vero cells (11, 15). In a human lung 
epithelial cell line (Calu3), in vitro EC50s for RDV and GS -441524 were 0.28 uM (169 ng/mL),and 0.62 
uM (181 ng/m L) by plaque assay. RDV demonstrated greater potency in human airway epithelial cells 
with an EC50 of 0.01 uM (6 ng/mL), likely due 
to higher GS -443902 concentrations in HAE 
cells in comparison to the Calu -3 and Vero E6 
cell types.  Due to poor hepatic stability, RDV  
should not be given orally as bioavailability is 
expected to be low.  RDV PK data at the 
currently recommended doses for COVID -19 
treatment are primarily limited to  healthy non -
pregnant adults studied in preparation for studies 
of RDV use against Ebola (16). See Table 1 
below for summary plasma PK parameters.  In 
this study, Day 1 peak plasma concentrations 
after a 200 mg intravenous (IV) dose 
administered over 30 minutes were 9.0 µM 
(5440 ng/mL) for RDV  and 0.5 µM (152 
ng/mL) for GS -441524. AUC 0-24h were 4. 8 µM-h (2920 ng*h/mL) for RDV  and 7.7 µM -h (2240 
ng*h/mL) for GS -441524  (15). Sparse PK results in a 66 year old female and a 67 year old male with 
COVID -19 have also been detailed (17). Median peak RDV concentrations of 4.54 uM (2737 ng/mL) and Figure 3: Expected PK of Remdesivir and GS -441524 and

 5.50 uM (3317 ng/mL) were measured in each of these patients, respect ively, on infusion Days 3 -9. GS -
441524 AUC 0-24h was 10.7 uM -h (3117 ng*h/mL) in the male patient, and 21.1 uM -h (6131 ng*h/mL) in 
the female patient, who had 1.96 -fold higher levels due to underlying renal dysfunction.   
 
No accumulation of RDV  occurred wi th multiple dosing, consistent with its measured half -life in plasma  
of just under 1 hour. Following single doses ranging from 3 – 225 mg IV, PK of GS -441524 were linear.  
GS-441524 reaches steady -state in 4 days and accumulated 1.9 -fold based on AUC, cons istent with its 
~24-hour half-life. The intracellular phosphorylated metabolite GS -443902 has a median half-life of 
32.23 to 48.38 hours. Renal and biliary excretion were the major routes of elimination in rats and 
monkeys. (15) In the mass balance study, mean total recover y of the dose was greater than 92%, 
consisting of approximately 74% recovered in urine and 18% recovered in feces . The majority of the IV 
RDV  dose recovered in urine  was the GS -441524 metabolite  (49%) followed by RDV  (10%) and other 
metabolites (18). The impact of pregnancy on hydrolase activity and RDV  PK is unknown. A simulation 
from modelling based on pregnancy PK data for other renally eliminated drugs is presented in Figure 3 
(19-22). The modelling and simulation suggest that increased  glom erular filtration rate  (GFR ) and renal 
tubular secretion associated with pregnancy will increase GS-441524 elimination.  Because RDV is 88 -
94% prot ein bound, while its metabolites are only 1 -2% protein bound  (9), pregnancy related changes in 
plasma protein concentrations  due to volume expansion and drug displacement from protein binding sites 
may also affect unbound RDV concentrations.

RDV  is currently licensed for use in adults and pediatric patients (12 years of age and older and weighing 
at least 40 kg) for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID -19) requiring hospitalization (9). 
The only RDV  PK data currently available are from  healthy non -pregnant adult volunteers , for which 
resul ts by sex were not detailed, and sparse PK results from two patients with COVID -19(9, 16, 17). No 
data describing RDV PK  in pregnant women or non -pregnant women with COVID -19 are available. 
Clinical data with RDV use in pregnancy are limited to the experience of 6 pregnant women in the 
Democratic Republic of Congo who received RDV  as Ebola treatment  and 67 pregnant and 19 
postpartum women who received remdesivir for COVID -19 under the Gilead compassionate use 
protocol (13, 23). Remdesivir was well tolerated by the pregnant women treated for Ebola (23).  The 
pregnant and po stpartum women who received RDV for COVID -19 under the Gilead compassionate use 
protocol all had room air oxygen saturation 94% or lower. There was one spontaneous miscarriage and 
one postpartum women who died but no pregnant woman or live born infant died . None of the pregnant 
women developed gestational hypertension or pre -eclampsia. Ninety three percent of pregnant women 
and 89% of postpartum women recovered from COVID -19.  Serious adverse events  (SAEs)  were 
observed in 29% of women, including deep vein thrombosis, hypertension, hypoxia and pleural effusion. 
Elevations of laboratory parameters were common, occurring in 67% (13). PK Parameter  Remdesivir  GS-441524

The use of RDV  in pregnant women in the absence of PK and safety data places pregnant women 
receiving RDV at risk for both inadequate therapeutic response and unrecognized maternal toxicity 
including adverse pregnancy outcomes .  
 
1.3 Rationale  
 
Although pregnant women are routinely excluded from COVID -19 experimental treatment protocols,  the 
care providers of pregnant  women  who develop severe COVID -19 are treating them with potential 
therapies in the absence of pregnancy specific PK and safety data and outside of research protocols. 
Under these circumstances, the fastest way to get the urgently needed RDV  pregnancy PK and safety data 
is through an opportunistic RDV  PK and safety protocol in pregnant women receiving RDV  as part of 
clinical care.  IMPAACT 2032  will follow the opportunist ic design of the highly successful IMPAACT 
P1026s study which between  2004 and 2019 performed  intensive PK sampling and safety evaluations for 
HIV and TB therap eutics  in over 1000 pregnant and postpartum women ,  successfully evaluating the PK 
and safety of  over 25 different HIV and TB medications  in pregnant and postpartum women. Because of 
the duration of treatment of HIV and TB, participants in IMPAACT P1026s were studied both during 
pregnancy and postpartum, serving as their own controls. This approach i s not possible with RDV, which 
has a treatment duration of 5 -10 days . As a result, women treated during pregnancy will generally not be 
receiving the drug postpartum. Under these circumstances the best comparison group for PK and safety 
data from pregnant women would be data from non -pregnant adult women of childbearing potential . 
Since such data are lacking for RDV, IMPAACT 2032  will also  simultaneously  enroll and study RDV PK 
and safety in a cohort of  COVID -19 positive,  non-pregnant women of childbearing potential . These non -
pregnant participants will provide the first data describing RDV PK and safety in women receiving RDV 
for COVID -19 and will serve as a comparison group for the IMPAACT 2032  pregnant women.  
 
The recent re cognition of the acuity and severity of COVID -19 in pregnant women mandate s rapid 
development of a streamlined protocol that can be implemented with minimal delay to provide the critical 
RDV pregnancy specific PK and safety data needed to allow RDV to be u sed safely and effectively in 
pregnant women.  This protocol was designed with recognition of the challenges posed by performing a 
research protocol on hospitalized participants acutely ill with COVID -19 during an ongoing and rapidly 
changing pandemic.  Priority has been given to obtaining the urgently needed pregnancy RDV PK and 
safety data as quickly as possible through protocol activities that pose the least risk of violating RDV 
infection control measures, to avoid putting clinical staff, research staff a nd other hospital patients at 
increased risk of  SARS -CoV-2 infection.  The protocol team has endeavored to develop a protocol that 
will acquire RDV PK and safety data in pregnant women as quickly, efficiently and safely as possible 
under these challenging conditions. The team has elected to design the study to facilitate ease and 
practicality of implementation and to focus on acquiring only those data necessary to provide an initial 
evidence base for the use of RDV in pregnant women.  This approach is reflec ted in many aspects of the 
protocol, including the eligibility criteria, participant data collection procedures, PK sampling and 
analysis approach, and duration of follow up.  
 
IMPAACT 2032  will provide critical RDV  PK and safety data  in women, allowing eva luations of 
exposure of RDV and its metabolites in both pregnant and non -pregnant adult women and of RDV safety 
when used in these populations . This protocol will provide urgently needed RDV PK and safety data in 
women  with COVID -19, providing evidence nec essary to ensure that RDV can be used safely and 
effectively in both pregnant and non -pregnant women of childbearing potential .

 STUDY DESIGN  
 
This is  a Phase IV prospective, open label, non -randomized opportunistic  study to evaluat e the  
PK and safety of RDV  when administered to  pregna nt and non -pregnant women  of childbearing 
potential  for treatment of COVID -19. RDV is not provided as part of this study ; a requirement for 
entry is that participants  receive  RDV as part of their clinical care (i.e., outside of the study).  
Participation in this study will have no effect on the cost of care for treatment of COVID -19 or 
the cost of  any RDV received for clinical care . Information on patient support for access to RDV 
can be found at https://www.vekluryhcp.com/patient -support/ . As no investigational drug is being 
provided to study participants , the study is opportunistic in nature  and clinical care decisions are 
made outside the context of this study , and as the Div ision of AIDS (DAIDS) at the US National 
Institutes of Health  (NIH) , as the study sponsor, is not charging for use of RDV  in the context of 
this study, 21 CFR 312.8 is not applicable to this study.     
 
A target of 20 PK evaluable pregnant  women  will be enrolled  into Arm 1; a target of 20 PK 
evaluable non -pregnant women of childbearing potential  will be enrolled into Arm 2. See Section 
10.2 for a definition of PK evaluable . Refer to  Section s 4.1 through  4.3 for the eligibility criteria 
and to Section 4.5 for a description of the recruitment, screening and en rollment process . Study 
sites will be located in the United States.   
 
Participants will be pregnant and non -pregnant women hospitalized for COVID -19 and will 
receive daily RDV infusions , typically for 5 days but in some cases  for up to 10 days , as part of 
their clinical care . RDV will be  provided and managed by the participants’ treating physician and 
will not be provided as a part of this study . Women may be enrolled prior to starting RDV  or after 
starting RDV but  must be enrolled prior to the start of the 4th infusion. Participants  will undergo  
intensive PK sampling on the day of the  3rd, 4th, or 5th infusion  (at site discretion) , as described in 
Section  6.4.1 . Protein binding capacity of RDV will  also be assessed ex vivo from the pre -dose 
intensive PK sample. Participants will also undergo  collection of  single PK sampl es with standard 
of care (SOC) labs  drawn  on the days of the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th infusions  (with the exception of 
the day of intensive PK sampling) , and also at 48 hours after the last infusion,  as described  in 
Section 6.4.2 . For Arm 1 participants , maternal  and cord blood PK sampling will be performed at 
delivery  for a comparison of maternal and fetal plasma RDV  concentrations  if the participant 
received RDV  infusion within the preceding  5 days . Additionally, for women in both Arms who 
are lactating,  and who consent  to this sample collection,  an optional breast milk sample may be 
collected on the intensive PK sa mpling day and at 48 -hours after the last RDV infusion , to assess 
breast milk concentrations of RDV and its metabolites.  
 
For all women, clinical and laboratory evaluations will be abstracted from the medical record . 
Pregnancy , birth, and infant  outcomes  will be obtained  from pregnant women enrolled in Arm 1. 
See Appendix  I and Section 6 for additional details . Arm 1 and Arm 2 participants will be 
followed through 4 weeks after the last infusion  of RDV ; Arm 1 women who are still pregnant at 
that time will have additional follow -up at  the time of delivery.

concomitant medications (see Section  5.3). 
 
4.5 Recruitment, Screening, and Enrollment Process  
 
RDV is an approved drug for treatment of COVID -19 in adults and pediatric patients requiring 
hospitalization, who are 12 years of age or older and who weigh at le ast 40 kg . Recruitment 
methods for this study may vary across sites  but are  expected to rely on ident ification of pregnant 
and non -pregnant women hospitalized  for COVID -19 in a facility that is affiliated with  an 
IMPAACT clinical research  site and who recently initiated treatment with RDV or who may 
require treatment with RDV . Clinical research s ite staff  will work with local care providers to 
identify hospitalized pregnant and non -pregnant women  with COVID -19.  
 
Due to COVID -19 infection control measure s, hospitalized pregnant and non -pregnant women 
are expected to be in isolation . Additionally, participants may be incapacitated and determined , 
per site -specific SOPs and sIRB  or other institutional , state, or local  guidelines , to be unable to 
provide indepen dent consent for themselves . Site staff must ensure that  information about the 
study is provided to the potential participant or her LAR (as applicable)  including detailed review 
of the study informed consent form, time to address any questions or concerns the potential 
participant or LAR may have , and an assessment of unde rstanding, before proceeding to informed 
consent  decision . Refer to Section 13.3 for further information on informed consent procedures 
for this stu dy, including  allowable  consent ing options in the context of COVID -19. The i nformed 
consent process will be  conducted in accordance with sIRB and other institutional  and local 
policies and procedures, and  fully documented consistent with the NIAID DAIDS po licies 
referenced in Section  11.2 and with 45 CFR 46.117 .  
 
Eligibility s creening will be initiated after informed consent is provided. Screening evaluations  
must be completed prior to en rollment . Screening evaluations may be performed up to and on the 
day of enrollment ; however,  all required screening outcomes  must be available prior t o 
enrollment.  
 
Each site must establish SOPs for eligibility determination that describe where and when 
screening procedures will be performed; roles and responsibilities for performing the required 
procedures; roles and responsibilities for assessing and  confirming eligibility; and procedures for 
documenting the process, taking into consideration the required timing of entry .  
 
Prior to enrollment, and after informed consent is obtained, sites will assign a participant 
identification number (PID) to the p articipant . The IMPAACT Data Management Center (DMC) 
Subject Enrollment System (SES) will be used to enroll participants in this study . For women  
found to be eligible, enrollment will occur upon successful entry of required eligibility data into 
the SES. Successful entry into the SES will generate a study identification number (SID ), for each 
enrolled participant . Refer to Section 9.5 for more information on monitoring participant accrual 
in this study.   
 
For Arm 1, only maternal participants will be enrolled in the study; fetuses /infants  will not be 
enrolled. However,  as some limited data will be collected on infant outcomes at birth as well as 
newborn physical exam findings , participants will be asked to  provide consent for data collection 
on their infants , as described in the sample consent forms in Appendix II. PIDs will not be 
assigned to infants  and these data will be collected on maternal eCRFs . 
 
 
IMPAACT 2032, FINAL  Version 2.0                    Page 27 of 79 18 December 2020  4.6 Participant Retention  
 
Once a participant is enrolled in this study, study staff will make every effort to retain her for the 
protocol -specified duration of follow -up, thereby maximizing  evaluability and statistical power 
and minimizing potential biases associated with loss to f ollow -up. Study site s are responsible for 
developing and implementing local procedures to reach this goal. Refer to Section 9.5 for more 
infor mation on monitoring par ticipant retention in this study.  
 
4.7 Participant Withdrawal or Discontinuation  from the Study  
 
Regardless of the participant retention procedures referenced above, participants  or their LAR  
may voluntarily withdraw  from the study. Participants may also be discontinu ed from study  
participation  by the site investigator or designee under the following circumstances : 
 
• Investigator or designee determines that continued participation in the study would be unsafe 
or otherwi se not in the best interest of the participant, after consultation with the  Clinical 
Management Committee ( CMC). 
• The study is stopped or canceled by the sponsors, government or regulatory authorities, or the 
sIRB .  
• Site participation in the study is cancelled by the sponsors, government or regulatory 
authorities,  or the sIR B.  
• The participant does not initiate RDV  within 7 days from study entry .   
 
For any participant who withdraws  or is discontinued  from the study prior to scheduled 
completion of follow -up, study staff will document the reason for the withdrawal or 
discontinuation  in detail  and enter the reason into  the appropriate eCRF . No final evaluations are 
required in the case of early study dis continuation or withdrawal .  
 
 
 DRUG UNDER STUDY   
 
No study  drug is provided as a part of this study.  The drug being evaluated in this study  is 
remdesivir ( RDV ) (GS-5734TM) and is referred to as the “drug under study .” RDV will not be 
supplied as part of this study. RDV is approved by the FDA and  is expected to be accessed by 
hospitals via existing drug distribution pathways external to the study and  will be administered by 
the treating phy sician consistent with the  prescribing information .   
 
The RDV Prescribing Information is   available  at:  
https://www.gilead.com/ -/media/files/pdfs/medicines/covid -19/veklury/veklury_pi.pdf  
 
5.1 Remdesivir Formulations  
 
RDV is available in two different formulations: lyophilized powder for reconstitution (100 mg) 
and premixed injection solution 5mg/mL  (100 mg) . RDV should be stored consistent with details 
as provided by the non -study sources who supply the drug to the par ticipants.  The formulation 
administered to each participant at each infusion will be captured on eCRFs as described in

RDV should be prepared and administered consistent with details as provided in the prescribing 
information . The standard  dosage of RDV is a single loading dose of 200 mg infused 
intravenously over 30 to 120 minutes on Day 1 followed by once -daily maintenance doses of 100 
mg infused intravenously over 30 to 120 minutes for up to 10 infusions  (30 minute  infusion 
administration  is recommende d where possible) . Based on the prescribing information, it is 
expected that participants who do  not require  invasive mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal 
membrane oxygenation (ECMO) will receive a 5 -day course of treatment , and participants 
requiring invasive mechanical ventilation or ECMO will receive a 10 -day course of treatment ; 
however, treatment may be discontinued early in either case  as determined by the treating 
physician.  After an infusion is complete , at least 30 mL of 0.9% saline will be use d to flush the 
line. The prepared diluted solution will not be administered with any other medications. The 
compatibility of RDV  injection with IV solutions and medications other than saline is not known.  
The dose  and volume  administered to each participant at each infusion will be captured on eCRFs 
as described in Section  6.4. 
 
5.3 Concomitant Medications  
 
The term concomitant medications refers to medications (prescription and non -prescription  as 
well as other investigational agents ) other than RDV received by enrolled participants. All 
concomi tant medications must be source documented ; a subset of concomitant medications will 
be entered into eCRFs as part of the medical and medication histories obtained at data collection 
timepoints as described in  Section  6. 
 
RDV is rapidly metabolized by hydrolases to a nucleotide monophosphate, which can be further 
phosphorylated to the active triphosphate form, or dephosphorylated to GS -441524. GS -441524  
is predominantly eliminated renally and does not affect common drug metabolism pathways. It is 
not anticipated that RDV will impact the PK of other medications. However, RDV is a substrate 
for P -glycoprotein and OATP1B1 and its transport  may be affected by  inducers or inhibitors of 
these transporters. PK results will be carefully evaluated in relation to concomitant medications  
during data analysis .  
 
5.4 Disallowed Medications at Entry  
 
Due to potential interactions with RDV or the formation of its active trip hosphate metabolite, GS -
443902 , the following medications are exclusionary if taken or administered within 48 hours prior 
to entry:  carbamazepine, hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, oxcarbazepine, phenobarbital, 
phenytoin, rifampin, rifapentine, rifabutin, ritonavir, St. John’s wort.   
 
 
 STUDY PROCEDURES AND DATA COLLECTION REQUIREMENTS  
 
An overview of study procedures  including PK sampling , blood volumes and data collection 
requirements  are presented in  the Schedule of Evaluations (SOE) in  Appendix  I. Presented in this 
section is additional information on study procedures and data collection requirements  for each 
study period  as follows : baselin e, infusion, safety -follow -up, and delivery (for women enrolled in 
Arm 1 ).  
 
 
IMPAACT 2032, FINAL  Version 2.0                    Page 29 of 79 18 December 2020  Because study participants will be hospitalized  with COVID -19 at study entry and while 
receiving  RDV infusion s, and given COVID -19 infection control measures , IMPAACT 2032 
study staff are e xpected to have limited contact with study participants . The treating physician  
(not affiliated with the study)  is responsible for RDV management and clinical care.  Study 
procedures for this study are limited to  data collection and blood specimens for PK . The study 
procedures described in this section are  the responsibility of the IMPAACT 2032 s tudy staff . 
With the exception of PK sampling, study  procedures will large ly be  done via medical chart 
abstraction and/or remote contact  or telemedicine visit . Refer to Section 10 for more details on 
PK design and analysis. Refer to the IMPAACT 2032 Laboratory Processing Chart (LPC)  for 
collection, processing, and shipping instructions  for PK samples . 
 
All procedures must be performed at the approved clinical research site or  approved associated 
facilities.  All procedures must be documented in accordance with the DAIDS policies for source 
documentation; refer to Section 11 for more information on documentation requirements and 
entry of e CRFs. Refer to Section 7 for information on expedited adverse event (EAE) reporting, 
which may be required at any time during follow -up. 
 
In addition to the protocol -specified procedures described  in this section  and the SOE Append ix, 
study staff may complete other tasks consistent with site SOPs, including but not limited to 
collecting, reviewing, and updating demographic and locator information; reviewing elements of 
informed consent;  and providing instructions for contacting study staff . All such tasks should be 
documen ted consistent with site SOPs.  
 
6.1 Data Collection Requirements  
 
Collection of clinical and laboratory data  is required throughout the study beginning at 48  hours 
before the first infusion and continuing through 4  weeks after the last infusion. Additionally, data 
will be collected at the time of delivery for participants in Arm 1, and limited data will also be 
collected from the birth and newborn exam records of their infants. The specific data collection 
requirements are described  in each sub -section below specific to each time period. All  
information  should  be obtained based on available medical records  or remote or telemedicine 
visit, in order to minimize ph ysical contact with the participant . Data abstraction and reporting 
should be targeted to occur as close as possible to the data collection timepoint indicated in the 
SOE; for the infusion time period in particular, sites are encouraged to key data each da y that 
infusions are administered, if possible.  
 
Documented medical conditions will be assessed for severity as described in Section  7.2.1 , and 
new conditions occurr ing after infusions begin will also be assessed for relationship to RDV as 
described in Section  8. Relevant dates will be recorded for all conditions and medications.  
 
Abnormal  findings identified prior to initiation of RDV infusions  will be entered into medical 
history eCRFs, and abnormal findings identified after initiation of RDV infusions  will be entered 
into adverse events eCRFs.  Administration of RDV  will be recorded on an Infusion Treatment 
Log eCRF  and use of concomitant medications in the time perio ds specified below will be 
recorded on the Concomitant Medication Log eCRF. Laboratory test results will be recorded on 
laboratory eCRFs as specified in Section  6.  
 
6.2 Screening /Entry   
 
Refer to Section 4.5 for a description of the study recruitment, screening , and enrollment process.  
 
 
IMPAACT 2032, FINAL  Version 2.0                    Page 30 of 79 18 December 2020  Screening procedures may be performed at any point after hospitalization and COVID -19 
diagnosis (or presumed diagnosis) , up to and including the day of enrollment.  Participants  or their 
LAR  (as applicable)  must provide consent before any activities  are performed to determine 
eligibility. See Section 13.3 for more information on the informed consent process. For potential 
participants who do not meet the eligibility criteria, screening should be discontinued once 
ineligibility is determined.  
 
Entry ma y occur at any time  after hospitalization and prior to the start of the 4th RDV infusion . 
Entry should be target ed for prior to or as close to  the start of RDV infusions as possible . 
Women who are enrolled but do not  initiate RDV within 7 days of entry will be discontinued 
from the  study  per Section  4.7.  
 
Procedures that may provide information relevant to eligibility for the study should be performed 
first, prior to final eligibility determination. Final eligibility determination must prece de 
enrollment. In the event that a woman  is found to be ineligible on the day of enrollment, 
enrollment should not occur.   
 
Screening and entry procedures include the following:   
 
• Obtain informed consent   
• Assign PID to woman  
• Obtain participant  medical rec ords  
• Document eligibility requirements  and demographics  in SES  
• Complete final eligibility determination and confirmation (Entry visit only, prior to 
enrollment)  
• Complete paper -based eligibility checklist, enter checklist data into SES to enroll the woman,  
print and file a copy of the confirmation file (Entry visit only)  
• Complete Visit Tracking eCRF  
 
6.3 Pre-infusion  
 
The Pre -infusion period  is defined as 48-hours prior s to initiation  of RDV infusions for COVID -
19. Clinical and laboratory data will be collect ed per Table 2 for this time period  (unless alternate 
time period is specified for specific data elements) . If Screening/Entry  occurs  within or after 48-
hours prior to the first  RDV  infusion , the clinical and laboratory data for the Pre-infusion  period 
will be collected retrospectively  after study entry .

 Intensive PK Sampling  and Optional Breast Milk Sampling  
 
Intensive  PK samples will be collected around  either the 3rd, 4th, or 5th infusion. Sites may choose 
which infusion is most convenient for collection of the intensive  PK samples. Intensive PK 
sample collection must be co mpleted within a single dosing interval (i.e., specific timepoints  may 
not be spread over different infusions). Intensive PK timepoints are shown in Table 4 below.  
 
RDV administration will begin after the pre -dose sample is drawn. PK samples should be 
collected from the opposite arm than the one used for infusion to prevent sample contamination. 
If not already in place, an intravenous catheter will be placed in an arm vein for serial blood 
collection. Plasma will be stored at each timepoint; additionally, PBMC and DBS will be isolated 
and stored from these samples at the pre-dose and 23-hour post -end of infusion (EOI) timepoint s 
to assess intracellular concentrations of GS -443902 . Additional blood  volume   will be collected at 
the pre -dose sample to assess the protein binding capacity of RDV , and will be processed 
separately from  the intensive PK plasma samples (see LPC) . Plasma will also be isolated from the 
pre-dose sample for quantification of α1 -acid glycoprotein (AAG).  
 
 
IMPAACT 2032, FINAL  Version 2.0                    Page 34 of 79 18 December 2020  For lactating w omen who have consented to provide a breast milk sample, an optional breast  milk 
sample will  be collected once  on the intensive PK day, at either the EOI, 0.75 -hour,  1.5-hour,  3-
hour,  or 5-hour EOI PK timepoint  (at site discretion).  Breast milk must be collected within 90 
minutes after  one of these timepoints.  If the participant has consented to provide this sample but 
circumstances do not permit collection of the breast milk sample (e.g., breast pump not permitted 
in participant room due to infection control measures, participant too sick to express milk), 
collection of this sample may be omitted . The date and time of breast milk sample collection will 
be source documented and entered into eCRFs. See the LPC for processing instructions.  
 
A study  staff member must be  physically present for each PK sample collection timepoint ; 
samples within each b lock may be collected  either by  a non -study clinical care provider under the 
supervision of the study staff, or by a study staff member  (see Section 6.4.3 ). Due to the unique 
processing requirements of the specimens ( see the LPC ), PK sample collection has been 
organized into 4 suggested  sample collection “blocks” which do not exceed 4 hours each.  The 
IMPAACT 2032 study staff member is responsible for batch transporti ng specimens to the 
processing lab  at the end of each block. Samples may be transported to the processing lab more 
frequently  than at the end of each block if time, resources and infection control measures permit, 
as long as a study staff member is able to  supervise  PK sample collection at each timepoint.

 Single Plasma PK Sampling  with Standard of Care Labs  
 
A convenience single plasma PK sample will be collected on infus ion days 2 through 5 , as 
feasible, ideally whenever blood samples are drawn as part of clinical care  for standard of care 
(SOC) labs . If possible, a Pre-infusion blood draw should be targeted for this sample collection. 
This sample should be omitted  on the  day of intensive PK sampling. If no blood samples are 
drawn for clinical care on a particular day, then the single PK sample may be  collected by itself if 
circumstances permit; if circumstances do not permit, this sample collection may be  omitted for 
that day. Single PK specimens are also subject to the unique PK specimen processing 
requirements ( see the LPC ). See the LPC for additional instruction . The date and time of PK 
sample collection  will also be source documented and entered into e CRFs.  
 
 PK Sampling Supervision by IMPAACT 2032 Study Staff  
 
As described above in Section 6, while the IMPAACT 2032 study staff  may not actually collect 
the PK sam ples, they are ultimately responsible for the samples and for ensuring samples are 
collected and processed in accordance with the IMPAACT 2032 protocol and procedures. Study 
staff must be present for the entire duration of PK sample collection, are respons ible for all data 
collection around PK sampling, and must provide direct supervision to any clinical care providers 
who collect the PK samples. If PK sampling cannot be performed by the IMPAACT 2032 study 
staff given COVID -19 infection control measures, PK sampling  must be done by a non -study 
clinical care provider under direct supervision of the IMPAACT 2032 study staff . Blood draw s 
will be done by the non -study clinical care provider in accordance with hospital standard policies  
and procedures  for phlebot omy. Individuals collecting specimens from COVID -19 infected 
participants and a ll research personnel involved in the study will strictly follow local hospital 
institutional standard operating procedures  for infection control .  
 
Direct supervision of clinical staff by research staff for PK sampling should be conducted through 
real-time video or in-person visual observation of the procedures , while allowing the study staff 
member to maintain physical distance from the participant a nd avoiding the need for  personal 
protective equipment that may be in short supply. The IMPAACT 2032 study staff are 
responsible for ensuring samples are collected  in the appropriate tubes at the appropriate 
timepoints, tubes are labeled correctly, and spe cimens are  processed per protocol.  Sites must 
determine the best process for interacting with and supervising the non -study clinical care 
providers for successful completion of PK sampling.  
 
6.5 Safety Follow -up Period  (48-Hour, 7-Day and 4 -Week Post -Last Inf usion)  
 
The Safety  Follow -up period begins from the first day after the  last RDV  infusion and continues 
for 4 -weeks after the last RDV infusion . The last infusion may be the 5th infusion, or may be an 
infusion earlier (if RDV was discontinued by the treating physician) , or an infusion between 5 
and 10 days depending on the treatment course for the participant . The procedures for this period 
include clinical and laboratory data collection per  Table 5, as well as collection of one single PK 
sample , and optional collection of breast milk in lactating  women at 48 -hours after the last 
infusion .   
 
This period  is divided into three data collection timepoints : 48-Hour, 7-Day, and 4 -Week Post 
Last Infusion . In addition to chart abstraction, telemedicine visits  may be used to obtain  and/or 
supplement or clarify  medical history information  after the participant has  been discharged from 
the hospital. At each data collection timepoint , a data lookback will take place  beginning  from the 
 
IMPAACT 2032, FINAL  Version 2.0                    Page 36 of 79 18 December 2020  first day after the end  of the prior data collection timepoint  until the current data collection 
timepoint;  only the data elements spe cified in Table 5 for that data collection timepoint period  
will be recorded on eCRFs .  
 
For Arm 1 participants who deliver within the Safety Follow -up period , and for all Arm 2 
participants, study participatio n will conclude  and participants will be taken off study once  the 4-
week post -last infusion  data collection is complete. For Arm 1 participants, who deliver after the 
Safety Follow -up period, study participation will end after delivery data collection  period is 
complete .  
 
NOTE: For Arm 1 participant i f delivery falls within the Safety Follow -up period, data for both 
periods should stil l be collected  and reported . If there is a gap in time between the Safety Follow -
up and Delivery periods, no data are to be collected during that time unless specified in Table 6.

 Single Plasma PK  at 48 -hours Post  Last Infusion  
 
For women who are  still hospitalized 48 hours  after receiving their last infusion  only, a single 
plasma PK sample will be collected  at the 48-hour post-last infusion  data collection timepoint 
(within a window of +/ - 12 hours) . Ideally this sample will be drawn at a time when other  blood 
samples are drawn as part of clinical care for SOC labs. If no blood samples are drawn for clinical 
care within the  window for the 48 -hour post -last infusion PK sample, then the single PK sample 
should  be collected by itself if circumstances permit . If circumstances do not permit, this sample 
collection may be omit ted. This si ngle PK specimen  is also subject to the unique PK specimen 
processing requirements ( see the LPC  for additional instruction). The date and time of PK sample 
collection will also be source documented and entered into eCRFs.  
 
 Breast Milk Sample Collection  at 48 -Hours Post Last Infusion  
 
At the 48 -Hour Post Last Infusion data collection timepoint  only, an optional  breast milk sampl e 
will be collected from postpartum lactating women who are still hospitalized and who consented 
to provide a breast milk sample.  
 
Breast milk samples may be collected within a window of +/ - 12 hours of the 48 -Hour Post Last 
Infusion timepoint.  If possibl e, collection of breast milk should be targeted to within 90 -minutes 
on either side of the 48 -Hour Post Last Infusion single plasma PK sample collection.  If 
circumstances do not permit collection of the breast milk sample  within +/-12-hour window  (e.g., 
breast pump not permitted in participant room due to infection control measures, participant too 
sick to express milk), collection of this sample may be omitted.  The date and time of breast milk 
sample collection will be source documented and entered into eC RFs. See the LPC for processing 
instructions.  
 
6.6 Delivery  Period  (Arm 1)  
 
The Delivery period is for Arm 1 women only. The Delivery  period is defined as  from onset of 
labor or start of Cesarean section  through 24 hours after delivery . In the Delive ry period, 
procedures include collection of c linical and laboratory data per Table 6 for the mother and 
infant ; as well as PK sampling for the subset of participants who have received a RDV infusion 
within 5 days prior to  delivery  per Section 6.6.1 .

If delivery occurs  after the end of the Safety Follow -up period , study participation will conclude 
and participants will be taken off study  after the Delivery  period  data collection is compl ete. If 
delivery falls within the Safety Follow -up period, data collection should be collected for both 
periods , and study participation will conclude and participants will be taken off study after the 
Safety Follow -up period data collection is complete.

scores, infant head circumference).   
 
 Delivery PK  
 
For Arm 1 women who have received at least one RDV infusion within the 5 days preceding  
delivery,  transplacental passage of RDV  will be assessed by measurement of drug concentrations 
in cord blood and maternal plasma at the time of delivery . For these women  only, a sample  will 
be drawn  at delivery  at the time the cord is clamped  (within 1 hour). A sample will also be 
obtained from  the umbilical cord, immediately after the cord is clamped (or within 1 hour) . 
Delivery PK specimens are also subject to the unique PK specimen processing requirements ( see 
 
IMPAACT 2032, FINAL  Version 2.0                    Page 39 of 79 18 December 2020  the LPC ). The date and time of PK sample collection will also be source documented and entered 
into eCRFs.  
 
6.7 Early Discontinuation of Remdesivir  
 
Women who discontinue RDV after initial PK sampling but prior to the 5th infusion will have no 
further PK sampling done. These women will be followed for safety and clinical outcomes 
throughout the duration of the study follow -up period, and clinical and laboratory data will 
continue to be collected as indicated in the SOE.  
 
6.8 Additional Considerations for Laboratory Procedures  
 
Each study site and laboratory involved in this study will comply with the DAIDS policy on 
Requirements for DAIDS Funded and/or Sponsored Laboratories in Clinical Trials Policy, which 
is available at:  
https://www.niaid.nih.gov/research/daids -clinical -research -policies -standard -procedures  
 
 Specimen Collection  
 
Specimens will be collected for this study as indicated in the SOE and per detailed guidance 
provided in the  LPC, which will be available on the study -specific webpage at : 
http://impaactnetwork.org/studies/IMPAACT _2032 .asp. 
 
In accordance with NIH recommendations,  for participants 18 years of age or older,  adult blood 
collection will not exceed 10.5 mL/kg or 550 mL, whichever is smaller, over any eight -week 
period . For participants less than 18 years of age,  pediatric blood collection will not e xceed 5 
mL/kg in a single day or 9.5 mL/kg in any eight -week period.   
 
Site investigators should review the participant chart to ensure that blood volume limits have not 
been exceeded prior to PK sampling. If limits will be reached , PK sampling should not be done or 
should be limited . In the event that blood collection must be limited, available specimens should 
be prioritized for use in the following order: (1) plasma for PK, (2) DBS for PK, (3) PBMC for 
PK. In this event, the CMC should also be notified a nd may provide guidance.   
 
 Specimen Prep aration, Testing, Storage, and Shipping  
 
PK specimens are subject to unique plasma processing requirements: blood samples  must be kept  
on ice before processing, a precisely measured proportion of stabilizing agent  must be added  to 
the specimens during plasma separation , and processed plasma samples  must be frozen  at -70 
degrees Celsius  or colder within 4 hours of specimen collection . All specimens collected for this 
study will be labeled, transported, processed, tested, stored , and/or shipped in accordance with the 
DAIDS policy referenced in Section  6.8, site and local laboratory SOPs, and the LPC.  The 
frequency of specimen collection will be directed by the SOE . Plasma, DBS, and PBMC 
specimens will be stored on -site and shipped for batch testing, according to the schedule listed in 
the LPC.  Refer to the LPC  for additional instruction related to PK specimens  shipping . The 
Laboratory Data Management System (LDMS) will be used to document specimen collection, 
testing, storage, and shipping as specified in LPC.  
 
 
IMPAACT 2032, FINAL  Version 2.0                    Page 40 of 79 18 December 2020  
 Biohazard Containment  
 
Transmission of SARS -CoV -2 and other respiratory  pathogens  are transmitted primarily by 
inhalation of droplet nuclei. Transmission of blood borne pathogens can occur through contact 
with contaminated needles, blood, and blood products.  Appropriate respiratory,  blood, and 
secretion precautions will be employed by all personnel in the collection of clinical samples and 
the shipping and handling of all clinical samples for this study, as currently recommended by the 
CDC  in the United States, the World Health Organization ( WHO ) internationally and the NIH. 
The current  CDC guidelines for SARS -CoV -2 specimen collection and handling are available: 
https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019 -ncov/lab/resources.html .  
 
All specimens will be shipped using packaging that meets requirements specified by the 
International Air Transpor t Association Dangerous Goods Regulations for  United Nations  (UN) 
3373, Biological Substance, Category B, and Packing Instruction 650.  If samples are processed 
through an intermediate location, central lab or other, should agai n decontaminate the outside o f 
the Styrofoam shipment container prior to shipment to lab.  Samples from this study must be 
shipped separately from any other studies. No sharing of a single container for multiple studies.  
 
 
 SAFETY ASSESSMENT , MONITORING,  AND REPORTING  
 
Participant safety will be carefully assessed, monitored, and reported at multiple levels 
throughout this study. Section 7 describes safety -related roles, responsibilities, and procedures for 
site investigators. The safety monitoring roles of the Protocol Team and the IMPAACT Study 
Monitoring Committee (SMC)  are briefly referenced in Section 7.1 and described in greater detail 
in Section 9.5. Unless otherwise noted, the specifications of this section apply to all study arms.  
 
7.1 Safety -Related Roles and Responsibilities  
 
IMPAACT 2032 is an opportunistic study  and RDV is not provided as part of this study ; it is 
expected that site investigators will not be the treating physicians  of COVID -19 infected patients 
receiving RDV.  The treating physician has primary respo nsibility for RDV clinical management 
and toxicity monitoring . It is expected that RDV will be provided, administered, and managed by 
the participants’ non -study treating  physician consistent with the prescribing information for 
RDV.   
 
 IMPAACT 2032 Site Investigators  
 
IMPAACT 2032 s ite investigators are responsible for additional close monitoring of safety data 
as described in Section  7.2 and for alerting the Protocol Team if unexpected concerns arise.  Site 
investigators will enter safety -related data into eCRFs as indicated in Section 7.2 and complete 
EAE reporting as indicated in Section 7.3. Site investigators are also responsible for prompt 
reporting of any unanticipated problems involving risks to participants or others  to the sIRB and 
any other applicable review bodies , per the procedures of each applicable review body . All 
investigators must follow sIRB requirements for prompt reporting, which are available at:  
https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/institutional_review_board/guidelines_policies/organization_p
olicies/prompt_reporting_policy.html  
 
 
IMPAACT 2032, FINAL  Version 2.0                    Page 41 of 79 18 December 2020  
 Clinical  Management Committee  
  
The following Protocol Team Members comprise the C linical Management Committee (CMC): 
Chair and Vice -Chairs, Medical Officers, Protocol Investigators, Pharmacologists, Statisticians, 
Data Managers, and Clinical Trial Specialists. The C MC will provide guidance as needed 
including but not limited to participant eligibility and PK sampling procedures.  
 
On behalf of the full Protocol Team, the C MC will monitor participant safety through routine 
review of study data reports  as described in Section  9.5.1 , and will review adverse event  (AE) 
reports  to assess and/or confirm  initial  investigator assessment of relatedness to RDV . Refer  to 
Section 8 for more information on participant management including relatedness assessments.  
 
7.2 Safety -Related Data Collection

Reporting of Adverse Events to DAIDS (DAIDS EAE Manual) will be used in this study. This 
definition will be applied to all participants , beginning at the time of t he first infusion until 4 
weeks after the last infusion  (and for Arm 1 participants,  during the  Delivery  period , if that occurs 
after Safety Follow -up period ). Any untoward medical conditions occurring prior to the first 
infusion will be considered pre -existing conditions.

7.3 Expedited Adverse Event (EAE) Reporting  
 
 EAE Reporting to DAIDS  
 
Requirements, definitions and methods for expedited reporting of adverse events are outlined in 
Version 2.0 of the DAIDS EAE Manual, which is available at:  
https://rsc.niaid.nih.gov/clinical -research -sites/manual -expedited -reporting -adverse -events -daids  
 
The DAIDS Adverse Experience Reporting System (DAERS), an internet -based reporting 
system, must be used for EAE reporting to DAIDS. In the event of system outages or technical 
difficulties, EAEs may be submitted using the DAIDS EAE Form. This form is avail able at:  
https://rsc.niaid.nih.gov/clinical -research -sites/paper -eae-reporting.  
 
For questions about DAERS, please contact NIAID CRMS Support at: 
CRMSSupport@niaid.nih.gov  
 
Queries may also be sent from within the DAERS application itself.  
 
For questions a bout expedited reporting, please contact the DAIDS RSC Safety Office at: 
DAIDSRSCSafetyOffice@tech -res.com  
 
 EAE Reporting Requirements for this Study  
 
The SAE  Reporting Category, as defined in Version 2.0 of the DAIDS EAE Manual, will be used 
for this study.  
 
Expedited reporting will be required for remdesivir (RDV) , the drug under study .  
 
In addition to the SAE  Reporting Category identified above, any fetal l oss under 20 weeks  of 
gestational age,  or fetal death  20 weeks  of gestational age  or over , must be reported in an 
expedited manner (i.e., as an EAE).  
 
 Grading the Severity of Events (applies to EAEs and all other adverse events)  
 
Adverse events will be graded , initially by the IMPAACT 2032 site investigator as described in 
Section 8, according to the Division of AIDS Table for Grading the Severity of  Adult and 
Pediatric Adverse Events (DAIDS AE Grading Table), Corrected Version 2.1, dated July 2017, 
which is available on the RSC website at:  
https://rsc.niaid.nih.gov/clinical -research -sites/daids -adverse -event -grading -tables  
 
For participants who are e ntering the study during pregnancy  (Arm 1), creatinine and creatinine 
clearance will be graded based on absolute values only and not change from baseline.  
 
Note: The DAIDS AE Grading Table Parameter for unintentional weight loss excludes 
postpartum weight  loss. Therefore, maternal weight loss  after delivery in Arm 1 women will not 
be graded in this study.  
 
 
IMPAACT 2032, FINAL  Version 2.0                    Page 44 of 79 18 December 2020  
 EAE Reporting Period  
 
The EAE reporting period for this study begins at the first RDV infusion administration and ends 
when the participant complete s all study follow -up. This includes any gap in time between the 
end of the Safety Follow -up Period and Delivery for women in Arm 1  -- EAEs should be reported 
for this ti me period if the site becomes aware of them .  
 
After the protocol -defined EAE reporting period, unless otherwise noted, only suspected 
unexpected serious adverse reactions ( SUSARs ) as defined in Version 2.0 of the DAIDS EAE 
Manual will be reported to DAIDS  if the study staff become aware of the events on a passive 
basis (from publicly available information).   
 
 PARTICIPANT MANAGEMENT  
 
No study  drug is provided as a part of this study.  As such, all clinical management and toxicity 
monitoring of participants r eceiving RDV will be the responsibility of the non-study treating 
physician.   
 
All adverse events identified in this study will be source documented in participant  research 
records, consistent with the policies and pro cedures referenced in Section 11. Among other 
details, source documentation will include the severity of each event (graded as described in 
Section  7.3.3 ). Relationship assessments will  be made initia lly by the  IMPAACT 2032  site 
investigator with guidance, as is feasible, from the treating physician.  If relationship assessment is 
not able to be made by the site investigator, the attribution should be marked as “unknown.” The 
CMC will review and confirm  all classifications ; in cases where relationship was marked as 
“unknown,” the CMC will be responsible for classifying the event  if possible . Where there is 
discordant assessment between the IMPAACT 2032 site investigator and the CMC, the site will 
be quer ied for more information. Ultimately, the CMC classification will be used for data 
analysis. Relationship  assessments  will be  according to the following categories  and definitions:  
 
Related  There is a reasonable possibility that the adverse event may be related to  RDV  
Not related  There is not a reasonable possibility that the adverse event may be related to  
RDV  
 
Further standardized guidance on determining whether there is a reasonable possibility of a 
relationship is available in the DAIDS EAE Manual, referenced in Section 7.2 above.  
 
All grade 3 or higher adverse events considered related  to RDV must be followed  to resolution 
(return to baseline) or stabilization , while the participant is on study.  
 
With respect to IMPAACT 2032  data collection, adverse events should be entered into eCRFs per 
Section  6.

 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 
9.1 General Design Issues  
 
This is a Phase IV prospective , open  label, non -randomized  opportunistic study  to describe the 
PK properties and safety of RDV  administered intravenously as part of clinical care among 
hospitalized pregnant and non -pregnant  women  with COVID -19. This study is comprised of two 
arms specific to the study population. The first arm will include pregnant  women, while the 
second arm will include non -pregnant women of childbearing potential . PK sampling will be 
performed during the RDV in fusions and w omen will be followed for safety for four weeks aft er 
the last  infusion; Arm 1 women who are still pregnant at that time will continue to be followed 
for safety at delivery.  
 
The target sample size is 20 PK -evaluable women for each arm. A participant’s PK data will be 
deemed unevaluable  by a protocol pharmacologist for a specific analysis if they do not have 
adequate PK evaluations to determine the PK parameter of interest for that analysis (see Section s 
9.6 and 10.2 for details). If a participant is deemed unevaluable for PK , the CMC will determine 
how to proceed with replacement . All women who receive any amount of RDV after enrollment 
will be evaluable for the safety analyses.  
   
The primary objectives are  to describe  the pharmacokinetics of RDV and its metabolite, GS -
441524, after administration to pregnant women as part of clinical care and to describe clinical 
and laboratory safety outcomes  in pregnant women receiving RDV as part of clinical care . The 
secondary objectives are to describe  the pharmacokinetics  of RDV and its metabolite, GS -
441524, after administration to non -pregnant women of childbearing potential  as part of clinical 
care, and to describe clinical and laboratory safety outcomes  in non -pregnant women receiving 
RDV as part of c linical care . Other objectives are  to describe placental transfer with collection of 
plasma and cord blood samples at delivery in mothers who have received RDV within the 
preceding  5 days , to compare the pharmacokinetics of RDV and its metabolite, GS -44152 4, in 
pregnant women to those observed in non -pregnant women of childbearing potential , to describe 
and compare intracellular concentrations of RDV’s active intracellular nucleotide triphosphate 
(GS-443902 ) in pregnant and non -pregnant women, to develop a PopPK model of RDV and its 
metabolites in pregnant and non -pregnant women  and evaluate associations between clinical 
characteristics and RDV and GS -441524 pharmacokinetics , to assess plasma protein binding of 
RDV in pregnant women and non -pregnant women of  childbearing potential, and to describe the 
frequency of detection and the relative concentrations in breast milk  and plasma of  RDV and GS -
441524 in lactating women undergoing RDV PK sampling . 
 
A challenge in designing this study is the current paucity of data on the PK parameters of RDV , 
particularly when given to adults with COVID -19, and their variability, as well as how they might 
differ during pregnancy. As discussed in more detail in Sectio n 10.5, while pregnancy is expected 
to alter RDV and GS -411524 drug disposition, the differences in  RDV  PK in pregnant versus 
non-pregnant women  are not expected to be of sufficient magnitude to require dosing 
modifications from the standard adult doses of RDV. A preliminary analysis approach  for this 
study is to assess if  drug exposure during pregnancy  is within 30% of the PK outcome measure (s) 
for a comparison population of  non-pregnant  adults , including healthy non-COVID -19 infected  
adults  (see Table 1 in Section 1.2) as well as adults with COVID -19 and non-pregnant women 
enrolled in Arm 2 of this study . Additional analyses to assess adequacy of dosing during 
pregnancy will be performed as more information on the PK and pharmacodynamics of RDV in 
adults with COVID -19 becomes available , including data from Arm 2 (non -pregnant women) of 
this study . The statistical analysis plan (SAP)  will be updated  as more data become available.  
 
IMPAACT 2032, FINAL  Version 2.0                    Page 46 of 79 18 December 2020   
This study design is opportunistic in that it enrolls women who may have already received at least 
one infusion of RDV. Consequently, the results may be overly optimistic. Because participants 
can be enrolled any time  prior to the 4th infusion,  the study p opulation will potentially not include 
women who started RDV and discontinued it prior to the 4th infusion due to toxicity, intolerance, 
virologic failure, or any other reason. Thus, this study may not be able to identify 
pharmacokinetic, safety, or tolera nce issues that occur very soon after drug initiation and 
estimates of the frequency of adverse outcomes may be overly optimistic. The fact that the results 
of this study may not generalize to the full population of women who start RDV will be discussed 
as a limitation of the study in presentations and publications of results.  
 
The Primary Completion Date (PCD) for this study will be the date on which data collection is 
complete for all the primary outcome measures, i.e., the last study visit. The primary d ata 
analyses will be performed after study completion.

As noted in  Section 9.1, the target number of participants in each a rm is 20  PK-evaluable women . 
This target was selected based on sample size calculations (below) regarding the ability of the 
study to indicate whether or not t he PK outcome measures in pregnant women are within 30% of 
the PK outcome measures for non-pregna nt comparison populations . We also calculated the 
precision provided for estimating the risk of adverse events  and the probability of observing zero 
events and of observing 1 -10 event(s) . As described in more detail in Section 9.5.2 , the data 
analyses that address the primary objectives will include descriptive statistics for the PK 
parameter of interest at specified timepoints as well as d escriptive statistics of safety outcomes.  
 
To determine an appropriate sample size  for the PK primary objective , we considered the 
precision for estimating the PK parameter with different target sample sizes, as measured by the 
width of the resulting conf idence intervals (CI) expressed as a percentage of the mean value . CI 
were calculated using the modified Cox approach (24). Currently, there is limited  PK data 
available for RDV in huma ns(15, 16). As was shown in Table 1, coefficient of variation (CV) 
estimates for RDV and GS -441524 AUCs  and C max range from 12.7% to 30.3% (i.e., 0.127 to 
0.303), based on data from 8 healthy adult  non-pregnant volunteers (15). Because the  protocol 
team e xpects study participants  will have a wide r range in age, disease severity, and stage of 
pregnancy (for Arm 1), resulting in a  higher variability than the available data,  we describe the 
precision with an assumed CV of 0.2, 0.3, or 0.4.   
 
Table 8 below illustrate s the upper and lower confidence limits  and width of the 90% CI for the 
mean PK parameter (e.g., AUC, T1/2, or Ctrough), express ed as a percentage of the mean, for 
different N and CV. With a sample size of 20 evaluable women and a CV equal to 0.3, the 90% 
CI will range from 89 – 112.3% of the mean, and the corresponding CI width will be 23.3% of 
the mean.  This relatively narrow CI would provide a very good indication of whether or not our 
data suggest  a greater than 30%  difference  from the PK parameter in non-pregnant comparison 
populations .

Because a n important objective , if feasible,  is to compare PK parameters  between Arm 1 and 
Arm 2 , we also calculated the power to achieve this objective, namely correctly detecting whether 
or not the PK parameter during pregnancy is more than 30% different from the PK parameter in 
non-pregnant women. We used an equivalence framework; i.e., we used PASS 15 to calculate the 
power to conclude that the 90% CI for the geometric mean ratio (GMR) of the PK parameter is 
within 0.7 to 1.43  (25).  
 
Table 9 below presents the power to conclude that the PK parameter in study pregnant women is 
not more than 30% differen t than the PK parameter in  non-pregnant women  (i.e.: the 90% CI of 
the GMR is within 0.7 to 1.43)  under the assumption that the geometric means of the PK 
parameter are the same (GMR = 1.0) or the geometric mean of pregnant women is 10% less than 
the geometric mean of non -pregnant w omen (GMR = 0.9). For a GMR = 0.9, t he power to 
conclud e that there is evidence that the PK parameters are not more than 30% different  for N = 20 
in both arms is 0.99, 0.84, or 0.63 with CVs=0.2 , 0.3, or 0.4 , respectively.  Thus, a sample size of 
at least 2 0 evaluable women in each arm is necessary to provide a power above 63% if the CV is 
0.4 or less. With a sample size of 20 evaluable pregnant women and only 10 evaluable non -
pregnant women, the probability would still be above 68% if the CV is 0.3 or less but only 42% if 
the CV is 0.4.

  Accrual  
 
Each arm will open to accrual independently and will accrue independently over approximately 6  
months  from the first enrollment in each arm . If it take s longer to reach the accrual target for Arm 
2 (non -pregnant women) than for Arm 1 (pregnant women) , the protocol team may decide to 
close accrual to Arm 2 if it has not yet fully accrued when 20 PK -evaluab le Arm 1 women have 
completed their study follow -up, s ince the study primary objectives only involve Arm 1 women 
and do not involve Arm 2 women .   
 
The initial enrollment limit will be 25 in each arm, based on an anticipated 20% unevaluable . The 
determination of evaluable participants is done by the protocol pharmacologists  (see Section 
10.2). The CMC may increase the enrollment limit in either arm to achieve the target number of 
20 PK -evaluable women. Changes to the enrollment limit will be implemented in the Statistical 
and Data  Management Center ’s (SDMC) enrollment system and sites will be notified and 
instructed via email . The IMPAACT Management Oversight Group ( MOG ) will also be notified.  
 
Refer to Section 9.5.2  for the definitions of unevaluable for PK and  Section 9.6 for the definition 
of unevaluable for safety.  
 
 
IMPAACT 2032, FINAL  Version 2.0                    Page 52 of 79 18 December 2020  9.5 Monitoring  
 
Implementation of this study will be monitored at multiple levels, consistent with standard 
IMPAACT procedures.  Detailed plans for s tudy monitoring will be outlined in a Study Progress, 
Data, and Safety Monitoring Plan (SPDSMP) developed by the SDMC prior to enrollment of the 
first participant . Sections 11 and 12 provide more information on on -site monitoring and quality 
management at the site level.  Further information on monitoring of study progress, quality of 
study conduct, and par ticipant safety a cross sites is provided below . 
 
 Monitoring by the Protocol Team  
 
Study Progress and Quality of Study Conduct  
 
The Protocol Team is responsible for continuous monitoring of study progress, including timely 
achievement of key milestones, and quality of study conduct.   
 
The Protocol Team will monitor the timing of site -specific study activation, which will determine 
when each site will begin accruing participants, and actual accrual following activation. For any 
site that is delayed in completing the study activation process, or that falls short of its accrual 
projections, the team will communicate with the site to identify the barriers the site has 
encountered and the operational strategies and action plans to address these. If relative ly few of 
the eligible sites have been activated after the study has been opened to accrual, the team will 
periodically re -assess the feasibility of the study and the reasons why sites have not been 
activated and may make adjustments as needed.  
 
The team w ill closely monitor total study  accrual  based on reports that will be generated at least 
monthly by the SDMC. Accrual performance will be reported by the DMC, by site and across 
sites, and the team will review and discuss study progress at least monthly.  If Arm 1 has not yet 
enrolled at least 10 pregnant women within 6 months after the first Arm 1 enrollment, or has not 
fully enrolled within 12 months after the first Arm 1 enrollment, the protocol team will assess 
whether the study remains feasible or needs  modification and will make a recommendation to the 
IMPAACT MOG  regarding study continuation or modification.  
 
The Protocol Team will similarly review participant retention and other key indicators of the 
quality of study conduct (e.g., data and specimen completeness) based on reports generated by the 
SDMC and take action with study sites as needed to ensure high quality study conduct throughout 
the period of study implementation.  
 
Determination of PK evaluability will be made by a protocol pharmacologist  and tracked in the 
study database  (see Section 10.2 for the definition of PK unevaluable).  If a participant is deemed 
unevaluable, the CMC will determine how to pro ceed with replacement, and the SDMC will 
implement the decision in the data management system and SES.   
 
 
IMPAACT 2032, FINAL  Version 2.0                    Page 53 of 79 18 December 2020  Participant Safety  
 
On behalf of the Protocol Team, t he CMC will closely review participant safety through routine 
review of safety data reports generated by the SDMC.  These reports will provide listing s of 
adverse  events  specified for entry into eCRFs, as described in Section 7.2. The CMC  will review 
these reports via conference call or other meeting at least monthly  (see Section 8 for details of the 
review of the assessed relationship of adverse events  to RDV ). At the time of each call, the 
DAIDS Medical Officer may, when possible,  also review any EAEs (defined in Section 7.3) 
reported to the DAIDS Safety Office that are not yet reflected in the data reports.  As drugs are not 
being provided in this study, there are no planned safety -related study action triggers o r stopping 
rules; however, t he CMC (and specifically, the clinician members) will continually evaluate the 
pattern and frequency of reported events and assess for any individual occur rences or trends of 
concern. If recurrent instances of a serious toxicity  are observed, appropriate authorities, such as 
the FDA and/or the pharmaceutical company, may be notified.  
   
 Monitoring  by the IMPAACT MOG and Study Monitoring Committee (SMC)  
 
An independent IMPAACT SMC will review the SPDSMP  in an introductory initial review , 
following policies described in the IMPAACT MOP .  
 
After the initial review, SMC reviews will only occur on an  ad hoc  basis if any issues or concerns 
arise , as determined by the IMPAACT MOG. The MOG will regularly review, at a minimum,  
accrual and retention reports. Also, as described above in Section 9.5.1, the CMC will closely 
monitor the study and will raise any issues or concerns to the IMPAACT MOG, part icularly with 
regard to accrual, feasibility, and participant safety.  The MOG will then determine if an ad hoc 
SMC review should be convened. F or ad hoc  SMC reviews, limited data will be reviewed, 
focusing on the events that triggered the reviews.    
 
Base d on any of its reviews, the SMC may recommend that the study proceed as currently 
designed, proceed with design modifications, or be discontinued.  The SMC may also provide 
operational recommendations to help address any study implementation challenges tha t may be 
identified during their reviews.   
 
9.6 Analyses  
 
This section provides a brief summary of the planned statistical analyses. Details will be specified 
in a separate, comprehensive SAP. Section 10.4 describes the pharmacology data analyses and 
modelling, including the non -compartmental and population PK analyses.  
 
The data analyses to address the primary and secondary PK and safety objectives will  include 
descripti ve statistics. PK outcome measures will be summarized using geometric means, 
arithmetic means, % CVs, and 90% CIs. The 90% CI for the arithmetic mean will be calculated 
on the log scale using the modified Cox approach (24). Continuous safety outcome measures , such 
as newborn birth weight,  will be summarized using mean and median as measures of location and 
the standard deviation  and quantiles of minimum, 25th percentile, 75th percentile, and maximum  
as measures of dispersion . Categorical safety outcome measures will be summarized using 
proportions and exact binomial (Clopper -Pearson) 95% CIs. Descriptive statistics will also be 
presented by trimester for Arm 1  
 
 
IMPAACT 2032, FINAL  Version 2.0                    Page 54 of 79 18 December 2020  For the objectives that compare PK parameters between arms, 90% CIs for the geometric mean 
ratio (GMR) of the PK parameters in study pregnant women versus non -pregnant women will be 
calculated to assess whether or not there is a greater than 30% difference  in exposure in pregnant 
women versus non -pregnant women. The confidence coefficient will be 90% rather than 95% to 
match the usual practice in the PK literature. We will use Schuirmann’s two one -sided tests 
(TOST) approach to show that the means of the tw o groups do not differ by more than the 30% 
margin of equivalence, i.e.: the 90% CI of the GMR is between 0.7 and 1.43 (26). As di scussed in 
Section 9.1, the 30% margin is a  preliminary analysis approach  (due to paucity of available data), 
and the SAP will be updated to include a dditional analyses to assess adequacy of dosing during 
pregnancy as more information on the PK and pharmacodynamics of RDV in adults with 
COVID -19 becomes available . 
 
For women who deliver within 5 days after receiving RDV, placental transfer will be assessed by 
comparing t he drug concentrations of RDV and GS -441524 in plasma from cord blood with 
concentrations in maternal plasma at delivery using the GMR with a 90% CI.   
 
The intracellular concentrations of GS -443902 at each timepoint and in each arm will be 
summarized using descriptive  statistics and compared between pregna nt and non -pregnant 
women  using the GMR with a 90% CI. Individual -level concentrations over time will also be 
visualized using spaghetti plots and compared within individual .   
 
The RDV free fraction from ex vivo  experiments will be summarized using descriptive statistics 
for pregnant and non -pregnant women, as will the unbound RDV concentrations  (calculated as 
follows: total concentration x free fraction)  and the Albumin and AAG concentrations.  
 
For lactating women meeting breast  milk collection criteria, the number  and percentage  of 
women with detectable maternal breast  milk concentration s for RDV and GS -441524 , and the 
breast milk/plasma ratios,  will be  calculated and summarized using descriptive statistics. Timing 
of breast milk and plasma sample collection since EOI will also be summarized.  
 
All analyses will include all participants with evaluable data for that analysis (see Section  10.2 for 
the definition of PK-unevaluable . For the safety analyses, a participant will only be deemed 
unevaluable if she does not receive any amount of RDV.   
 
 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY PLAN  
 
The design and analysis plans for the primary , secondary  and other pharmacology objectives are 
described in this section. Detailed PK sample collection, processing, storage and shipping 
instructions are provided in the LPC.  
 
10.1 Pharmacology Overview and Objectives  
 
This is an opportunistic study designed to assess the PK and safety of RDV in pregnant and non -
pregnant women with COVID -19. Arm 1 of this study will include women at any stage of 
pregnancy who have COVID -19 and will receive RDV as part of their clinical c are, at the 
standard adult dose of 200 mg IV on day 1, followed by 100 mg IV on days 2 through 5 to 10. 
Arm 2 of this study will include non -pregnant women of childbearing potential  who have 
COVID -19 and will receive RDV as part of their clinical care, at the standard adult dose of 200 
mg IV on day 1, followed by 100 mg IV on days 2 through 5 to 10. Intensive PK samples will be 
collected on the day of the 3rd, 4th, or 5th infusion (at site discretion), as described in Section 6.4.1 . 
PMBC and DBS  for intracellular assessments of GS-443902  will be isolated with the pre -dose 
 
IMPAACT 2032, FINAL  Version 2.0                    Page 55 of 79 18 December 2020  and 23 -hour post -dose samples  on the intensive PK day . Additional blood will be collected with 
the pre-dose intensive PK sample to assess RDV protein binding ex vivo. A sparse PK sample 
will also be collected with standard of care (SOC) labs on the days of the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th 
infusions, as described in Section 6.4.2 , and 48 hours after the last RDV infusion in women who 
are still hospitalized, as described in  Section 6.5.1 . Sparse samples will not be collected on the 
day that intensive PK sampl es are collected . For women who receive a RDV dose within 5 days 
prior to  delivery, a single maternal sample at delivery  and a cord blood sample at the time when 
the cord is clamped will also be collected.  For lactating women  meeting breast milk  collection 
criteria , breast milk  samples will also be collected at one of the scheduled time points between 
EOI and 5 hours EOI du ring the intensive PK assessments, and at the 48 hour post -last infusion 
time point.  
 
The pharmacology objectives for this protocol include all of the objectives listed in Section 2, 
except 2.1.2  and 2.2.2 .  
 
10.2 Definition of PK Evaluable  
 
Women will be considered PK evaluable  for the intensive PK assessment  if at least 3 out of 4 of 
the 1st block  (pre-dose through 3 hours post -EOI)  intensive  PK samples are collected , and at least 
1 sample in the 2nd block (5 or 7 hours post -EOI), and either the pre -dose or 23 hour post -EOI 
sample  is collected . In addition to these minimum requirements for sample collections, drug 
concentrations will also be reviewed once available to further assess whether the participant is PK 
evaluable . Profiles with missing samples will be assessed for evaluability by the pharmacologists 
and CMC on a case -by-case basis.  Participants deemed unevaluable  will be replaced  to achieve a 
target of 20 PK evaluable partici pants in each Arm . Every effort should be made to collect all 
timepoints of interest. PK results from women who had incomplete PK sampling due to early 
discontinuation of RDV may be included in population PK modeling and simulations.  
 
10.3 Pharmacology Outcome Measures  
 
Pharmacology outcome measures are described in Section 9.2.  
 
10.4 Pharmacology Data Analysis and Modeling  
 
 Non-Compartmental PK Analyses  
 
Descriptive presentat ion of the concentrations and the various collection times will be 
summarized. A non -compartmental PK analysis (NCA) will be performed on the plasma 
concentration -time data generated for each participant. Calculated PK parameters will include, as 
permitted by data:  
  
• RDV AUC  
• RDV C max  
• GS-441524 Ctrough  
• RDV terminal elimination rate constant (λ z) and  
• RDV the terminal elimination half -life (T1/2). 
 
RDV C max will be taken directly from the observed concentration -time data and is expected to 
occur at the end of the infusion. Data permitting, the RDV terminal slope, λ z, will be determined 
from log -linear portion of the curve and the terminal half -life (T 1/2) calculated as 0.693/ λ z. RDV 
 
IMPAACT 2032, FINAL  Version 2.0                    Page 56 of 79 18 December 2020  AUC will be determined using the linear trapezoidal method. In absence of adequate PK data to 
perform an NCA , other appropriate compartmental analyses may be undertaken to describe the 
plasma PK of RDV  and GS -441524. The random s parse (single) PK sample concentrations on 
days 2-5 and 48 hours post -last-infusion, intracellular concentrations in DBS and PBMC , RDV 
protein binding results , and among lactating women, frequency of RDV and/or GS -441524 
detection in breast milk  and matern al breast milk/plasma ratio  will be summarized descriptively.  
 
 Population PK Analyses  
 
Population PK analyses will be performed for RDV and GS -441524 using the IMPAACT 2032 
PK data alone using appropriate methodology. These data may be combined with other non-
pregnant adult PK data, as they become available. PK analyses of collected data, including 
population PK evaluations, may be performed to assist the study team with assessment of safety 
or adequacy of dosing during pregnancy. With data from 20 pregnant  and 20 non -pregnant 
women, the population PK modeling and approximately 12 PK samples per participant, the power 
to build complex PK models will be limited. Thus, the population PK analysis will focus on 
determination of mean  clear ance (CL) and volume of distribution  (V) for GS -4451524 and RDV 
and their variabilities. A limited number of key clinical variables will be assessed as potential 
covariates including pregnancy stage, gestational age, weight, renal function and age.  
 
10.5 Anticipated Outcome s  
 
Based on simulations presented in Section 1.2, RDV and GS -441524 exposures in pregnant 
women are expected to achieve concentrations within the range of those obse rved in healthy 
adults. While pregnancy is expected to alter RDV  and GS -441524 drug disposition, the pathways 
responsible for RDV metabolism and elimination have not been previously studied in pregnancy. 
It is expected that the PK of RDV and its metabolite s will differ between pregnant and non -
pregnant women but that these will not  be of sufficient magnitude to require dosing modifications 
from the standard adult doses of RDV . A preliminary analysis approach for this study is to assess 
if drug exposure during pregnancy is within 30% of the PK outcome measures for a comparison 
population of non -pregnant adults, including healthy non -COVID infected adults ( see Table 1 in 
Section 1.2) as well as adults with COVID -19 and nonpregnant women enrolled in Arm 2 of this 
study . If toxicities are noted, relationships  with RDV and GS -441524 exposures may be explored. 
Additional analyses to assess adequacy of dosing during pregnancy will be performed as more 
information on the PK and pharmacodynamics of RDV in adults with COVID -19 becomes 
available, including data from Arm 2 (non -pregnant women) of this study. Since this is an 
observational and opportunistic study, which does not dictate therapy, actual dose modifications 
in study participants will not occur and are not applicable.

 DATA HANDLING AND RECORD KEEPING  
 
11.1 Data Management Responsibilities  
 
As described in Section 4.5, data on enrollment in this study will be collected using the DMC 
SES.  Study sites must maintain adequate and accurate research records containing all information 
pertinent to the study for all screened and enrolled women , including paper -based CRFs (if used), 
eCRFs, and supporting source data.  In maintaining these records, sites m ust comply with the 
standards of source documentation specified in the DAIDS policy on Requirements for Source 
Documentation in DAIDS Funded and/or Sponsored Clinical Trials (available on the website 
referenced in Section 11.2). 
 
eCRFs and an eCRF completion guide will be made available to study sites by the DMC.  Study 
site staff will enter required data into eCRFs, with system checks applied and data queries 
generated immediately upon saving the entered data.  Data must be entered within timeframes 
specified by the DMC; queries must also be resolved in a timely manner.  Selected laboratory data 
will be transferred electronically to the DMC through t he LDMS.   
 
Further information on eCRFs and IMPAACT data management procedures will be provided by 
the DMC.  A User Manual for the Subject Enrollment System  is available on the DMC portal at : 
https://www.frontierscience.org . 
 
11.2 Essential and Source Documents and Access to Source Data  
 
All DAIDS policies referenced in this section are available at:  
https://www.niaid.nih.gov/research/daids -clinical -research -policies -standard -procedures  
 
Study sites must comply with DAIDS policies on Requirements for Essential Do cuments at 
Clinical Research Sites Conducting DAIDS Funded and/or Sponsored Clinical Trials and 
Requirements for Source Documentation in DAIDS Funded and/or Sponsored Clinical Trials.  In 
its policy on Requirements for Manual of Operational Procedures, DAID S requires sites to 
establish SOPs for maintaining essential and source documents in compliance with these policies.  
Site SOPs should be updated and/or supplemented as needed to describe roles, responsibilities, 
and procedures for this study, and site SOPs  should be followed throughout the study.  
 
Per the DAIDS policy on Storage and Retention of Clinical Research Records, study records must 
be stored in a manner that ensures privacy, confidentiality, security, and accessibility during the 
conduct of the study and after the study is completed.  Record s must be retained for a minimum of 
three years after the completion of the study.  Per 21 CFR 312.62, records must be maintained for 
two years after the date a marketing application is approved for one or more of the study products 
for the indication for w hich it is evaluated in this study; or, if no application is filed, or if the 
application is not approved for this indication, records must be retained two years after the study 
is discontinued and the FDA is notified.  
 
 
IMPAACT 2032, FINAL  Version 2.0                    Page 58 of 79 18 December 2020  All study records must be accessible for inspection, monitoring, and/or auditing during and after 
the conduct of the study by authorized representatives of the study sponsors and their contracted 
monitors, IMPAACT,  Gilead  Sciences, Inc. , the US Food and Dr ug Administration, site drug 
regulatory authorities, the sIRB  and any applicable local IRBs , Office for Human Research 
Protections (OHRP ), and other US, local, and international regulatory entities . Records must be 
kept on -site throughout the period of study implementation; thereafter, instructions for off -site 
storage may be provided by NIAID or NICHD.  No study records may be removed to an off -site 
location or destroyed prior to receiving approval from NIAID or NICHD.  
 
11.3 Quality Control and Quality Assur ance  
 
Study sites must ensure that essential documents and participant research records are subject to 
continuous quality control and quality assurance procedures consistent with the DAIDS policy on 
Requirements for Clinical Quality Management Plans, which  is available at:

 CLINICAL SITE MONITORING  
 
Site monitors under contract to NIAID or NICHD will visit study sites to inspect study facilities 
and review participant s tudy records — including informed consent  forms, paper -based CRFs  (if 
used) , eCRFs, medical records, laboratory records, and pharmacy records  — to ensure protection 
of study participants, compliance with the sIRB approved protocol, and accuracy and 
completeness of records .  
 
The monitors also will review essential document files to ensure compliance with all applicable 
regulatory requirements.  Site investigators will make study facilities and documents available for 
inspection by the monitors.   
 
 
 HUMAN SUBJECTS PROTECTIONS  
 
13.1 Institutional Review Board/Ethics Committee Review and Approval  
 
The Johns Hopkins Medicine IRB serves as the s ingle IRB (sIRB) for IMPAACT studies  at US 
sites; site IRBs also provide local context reviews for US sites. Site investigators are responsible 
for awareness of and adherence to the policies and procedures of all applicable IR Bs. All such 
policies and procedures  must be followed and complete documentation of all correspondence to 
and from all applicable IRBs must be maintained in site essential document files.  Sites must 
submit documentation of both initial review and approval and continuing review to the DAIDS 
Protocol Registration Office (PRO) in accordance with the DAIDS Protocol Registration Manual 
(see also Section 14.2). 
 
Prior to study initiation, sit e investigators must obtain sIRB  review and approval of this protocol 
and site -specific informed consent and assent forms in accordance with 45 CRF 46; subsequent to 
initial review and approval, the sIRB  must review the study at least annually.  Site invest igators 
must also promptly report to the sIRB any changes in the study and any unanticipated problems 
involving risks to participants or others.  
 
 
IMPAACT 2032, FINAL  Version 2.0                    Page 59 of 79 18 December 2020  13.2 Pregnant Women, Children, and Vulnerable Participants  
 
The NIH is mandated by law to ensure that pregnant women and children be included in clinical 
research when appropriate (27, 28). Recent national and international guidance also recommends 
the inclusion of pregnant women in clinical trials (29, 30). This study re sponds to these  mandate s 
and will provide clinical research data to inform treatment of COVID -19 in pregnant women. Per 
the US Code of Federal Regulations  (CFR) , the sIRB and local IRB  must consider the potential 
risks and benefits to maternal  participants , and their fetuses , as described in 45 CFR 46 Subpart B 
(for pregnant women, fetuses, and neonates)  and 45 CFR 46 Subpart D (for children).  
Additionally, women  who are severely ill with COVID -19 to the point of being incapable of 
giving consent would be  considered vulnerable per the definition of ICH E6 (R2) 1.61 , and thus 
the sIRB and local IRB must pay special attention to safeguarding the rights, safety, and well -
being of these participants . While fetuses/ infants  of Arm 1 participants  will not be enrolled in this 
study, participants in Arm 1 will be asked to consent to collection of a limited amount of data on 
the out comes of their infants at birth.   
 
With respect to 45 CFR 46 Subpart B, the sp ecifications of 45 CFR 46.204 (d) are expected  to 
apply  to this study . There is no prospect of direct benefit for the woman nor the fetus, risk to the 
fetus from participation in this study (which is limited to blood draws  on the mother  while the 
fetus is in utero ) is not greater than minimal,  and the purpose of this research is the development 
of important biomedical knowledge that c annot be obtained by any other means (as further 
described in Section 1.3). Therefore, pregnant participants  (or their LAR ) will be asked to provide  
informed consent  for their own  study participation  (including abstraction of infant outcome data)  
under 45 CFR 46 Sub part A , and as desc ribed in Section 13.3.  
 
With respect  to 45 CFR 46 Subpart D as it applies to collection of infant data after birth, the 
specifications of 45 CFR 46.404 are expected to apply. The extent of the research activities with 
the infant are limited to  collection of clinical data that would otherwise be collected in the 
medical record. N o procedures are performed directly on the infant. As such, the research is not 
greater than minimal risk. Per 45 CFR 46.408 (b), it is expected that the sIRB will find  that the 
consent of one parent is sufficient for research to be conducted under 46.404 . 
 
13.3 Informed Consent  
 
Refer to Section 4.5 and the study -specific MOP for further information on informed consent 
procedures for this study.  A sample  informed consent form  is provided in Appendix II.  
 
Informed consent for study participation will be obtained from each  participant before any study -
specific procedures are performed.  If the participant is unable to provide informed consent (e.g . 
impaired capacity, as determined by site SOPs and consistent with sIRB  policies and procedures) 
written informed consent will be obtained from the participant’s LAR  on behalf  of the participant 
in accordance with 21 C FR 50.27 .  
 
Per FDA Guidance on Conduct of Clinical Trials of Medical Products during COVID -19 Public 
Health Emergency dated March 2020, updated May 14, 2020, while FDA regulations generally 
require that the informed consent of a participant be documented by the use of a written consent 
form that has been approved by the IRB and signed and dated by the participant at the time of 
consent (21 CFR 50.27(a)), in lig ht of COVID -19 infection control measures, if the participant is 
in COVID -19 isolation, electronic methods of obtaining informed consent and verbal 
confirmation will be considered as determined by site SOPs and consistent with sIRB and local 
IRB policies a nd procedures. The method used to assess the decision -making capacity of the 
 
IMPAACT 2032, FINAL  Version 2.0                    Page 60 of 79 18 December 2020  participant and how consent was obtained must be documented in the participant’s research 
record.  
 
In obtaining and documenting informed consent, the site investigator must comply  with 
applicable regulatory requirements, ICH GCP guidelines, and ethical principles. The informed 
consent form must be approved by the sIRB prior to its use . The informed consent process will 
include information exchange, detailed discussion, and assessme nt of understanding of all 
required elements of informed consent, including the potential risks, benefits, and alternatives to 
study participation.   
 
In light of the circumstances presented by conducting research during COVID -19, the informed 
consent SOPs for all sites must include the following information:  
 
• The method to be used to assess the decision -making capacity of participant s. 
• The process for  obtaining consent when a participant is not capable to consent on her own 
behalf (i.e., lacks decision -maki ng capacity).  
• Information about who can serve as a LAR  and the process for LAR selection , in accordance 
with applicable local laws . 
 
13.4 Potential Benefits  
 
There will be no direct benefit to participants  who take part in this study. Information learned 
from this study may be of benefit to participants and  others in the future . 
 
13.5 Potential Risks  
 
The potential risks of participation in this study include risks associated with study procedures . 
Most study pr ocedures are routine medical procedures that are associated with minimal to no risk 
in participants. Blood collection may cause pain, bruising, swelling, or fainting. There is a very 
small chance of infection where the needle is inserted.   
 
13.6 Reimbursement/C ompensation  Plan  
 
Pending sIRB  approval, participants will be compensated  for time and inconvenience  associated 
with completing  data collection and  PK sampling  visits  as part of this study . Specific 
compensation amounts will be determined by the sIRB in collaboration with local IRB and will 
take into consideration local cost of living and intensity of each visit/data collection.  Participants 
will be compensated  one payment  between  $10 - $50 for each data collection  time period (i.e., 
baseline, infusion period, safety follow -up, and delivery ) for a total of up to 4 payments just for 
data collection . On days where there is also PK sampling, participants  will receive an additional 
$50-250 for ea ch PK sampling day depending on intensity of sampling  as determined in 
consultation with the sIRB and local context review.  Participants will not be compensated for the 
cost of their COVID -19 treatment.  
 
13.7 Privacy and Confidentiality  
 
Every effort will be made to protect participant privacy and confidentiality to the extent possible.  
Participant information will not be released without written permission to do so except as 
necessary for review, monitoring, and/or aud iting as described in Section 11.2. Data or 
information from the study may be shared with drug companies  who have agreements with 
 
IMPAACT 2032, FINAL  Version 2.0                    Page 61 of 79 18 December 2020  IMPAACT and/ or the US NIH, or regulatory entities, but ind ividual participants will not be 
identified.  
 
All study -related information will be stored securely.  Participant research records will be stored 
in locked areas with access limited to study staff.  All laboratory specimens, CRFs, and other 
documents that may be transmitted off -site will be identified by PID only.  Likewise, 
communications between study staff and Protocol Team members regarding individual 
participants will identify participants by PID only.   
 
Study sites are encouraged but not required by DAIDS policies to store study records that bear 
participant names or other personal identifiers separately from records identified by PID.  All local 
databases must be secured with password protected access systems.  Lists, log books, appointment 
books, and any other documents that link PID numbers to personal identifying information should 
be stored in a separate, locked location in an area with limited access.   
 
In addition to the above, a Certificate of Confidentiality has bee n obtained for this study from the 
US Department of Health and Human Services.  This certificate protects study staff from being 
compelled to disclose study -related information by any US Federal, state, or local civil, criminal, 
administrative, legislative,  or other proceedings.  It thus serves to protect the identity and privacy 
of study participants.   
 
13.8 Management of Incidental Findings  
 
The results of PK evaluations are not planned to be provided to participants as these evaluations 
will be performed after follow -up has been completed and are not expected to be relevant to 
clinical care and management, especially given the short treatment duration of RDV. If, however, 
new information becomes available during the course of the study indicating that the result s of 
these evaluations are of clinical relevance, the results will be provided  to study participants . 
 
13.9 Management of New Information Pertinent to Study Participation  
 
Participa ting women  will be provided with any new information learned over the course of the 
study that may affect their willingness to remain in follow -up in the study.

APPENDIX I FOOTNOTES  
1. Entry may occur at any point after hospitalization and prior to the start of the 4th infusion.  
2. Pre-infusion  period  is defined as 48 hours prior to start of first infusion. Collect data retrospectively if enrollment occurs  after this 48-hour window has 
started or passed .  
3. For any participants whose treatment is continued past the 5th infusion, clinical and laboratory data will be abstracted and recorded for each infusion day 
while infusions are ongoing  per Section  6.4.    
4. The Safety Follow -up Period may occur before  or after Delivery . For Arm 1 women, i f Delivery occurs within the Safety Follow -up Period , data for 
both periods should still be collected and reported . 
5. Delivery procedures are for Arm 1 women only. If an RDV infusion was NOT given within 5 days preceding  delivery, PK sampling will not be 
performed.  Delivery period is from onset of labor through 24 -hours after delivery.  
6. See Section 6 for data collection requirements for each period.  
7. Only perform  intensive PK  sampling schedule once , with the 3rd, 4th or 5th infusion. See Section 6.4.1  for collection timepoints.  
8. Collect only once on the intensive PK day, with the pre -dose sample only.  
9. To be measured from leftover blood sample used for DBS, see  LPC.  
10. Collect  when blood samples are drawn as part of clinical care  (preferably prior to infusion administration on that day)  – if no SOC bloods are drawn on 
a given day, single  PK sample  may be collected if circumstances permit, but if unable to collect, the sample may be  omitted  for that day. Do not collect 
on the day that  intensive PK sampling is performed .  
 
IMPAACT 2032, FINAL  Version 2.0                    Page 68 of 79 18 December 2020  11. Only collect samples for women still hospitalized. If the participant has already been discharged, omit this s ample  collection. If still hospitalized and if 
possible, collect single PK sample when blood samples are drawn as part of clinical care. If no bloods are drawn on this day for clinical care, draw blood 
specifically for single PK sample. See Section 6.5. 
12. Only for women who have consented to provide breast milk samples, and only if women are lactating at the time of PK sampling.  
13. Collect only one breast milk sample, on the intensive PK day. See Section 6.4.1  for collection timepoints.  5 mL is the optimal volume, but any 
volume >0.5 mL will be accepted.

Version 2.0, 18 December 2020  
 
Introduction  
 
You are being asked to take part in the research study named above .  
 
This consent form gives information about the study. Please read it, or have it read to you, and ask any questions 
you may have. You may have as much time as needed to fully understand the study. We will ask you questions to 
see if we have explained the st udy clearly.  
 
This study is a multi -site study, meaning it will take place at several different locations. Because this is a multi -
site study, this informed consent form includes two parts. Part 1 of the consent form includes general study 
information tha t applies to all study sites. Part 2 of the consent form includes information only about  the study site 
where you are being asked to enroll. Before making your decision, both parts of this form will be reviewed with 
you. You will have the opportunity to di scuss any questions about this form and both of its parts with your site’s 
study team.  
 
Key Information  
 
Here is a summary of important information about the study:  
 
• You are being asked to take part in this study because you are hospitalized with COVID -19 and are 
currently  getting,  or may get in the future,  remdesivir medication for treatment of COVID -19. 
•  You will not receive remdesivir through this study if you choose to join this study. You will  continue 
to get care and treatment for COVID -19 by your cli nical care provider.  Participation in this study 
will not impact whether or not you receive remdesivir for treatment of COVID -19.   
• The primary  purpose  of the study  is to determine  how much  of the remdesivir  medication  is in a 
woman’s  blood . Another  purpo se is to look at how safe remdesivir  is for a woman.   
• If you choose to join the study, you will have blood samples taken at the same time that you are  
having remdesivir infusions.

right before you start remdesivir, while you are receiving remdesivir, and for one month after you 
finish your remdesivir .   
• If you choose to join this study, the study staff may contact you up to three times during the  month 
after your last remdesivir infusion to ask you questions about your health.  
• If you choose to join the study and you are pregnant, information from your medical records will also 
be collected about your pregnancy  and your delivery . Information will also be collected from your 
medical records and/or your baby’s  newborn  medical records about  your baby’s examination (s) 
within the first day of life .  
• It is possible to join this study and then not receive remdesivir infusions. If you do not start 
remdesiv ir infusions within 7 days after joining the study , you will not stay in the study.  
• There is  no direct benefit to you from being in the study. However, this study may help doctors learn 
information that will help in the treatment of future patients with remdesivir for COVID -19.  
• The most likely risk to you is from blood drawing - including pain, which is usually minor, and 
infection, which is rare .  
• There could be risks of disclosure of your information.  
• Your decision  about this study  will have no effect on the medical care that you would normally 
receive from your clinic al care provider , the cost of your care,  or your clinical care provider’s 
decision to treat you with remdesivir . Your access to services, and the benefits and rights y ou 
normally have, will not be affected.  
 
More information is given in both parts of this form about the study, its risks and benefits.  You should feel that 
you understand the study before deciding whether to participate. After you understand the study, and  if you decide 
that you will join the study, you will be asked to sign or make your mark on this form. You will be offered a copy

About the study  
 
This study is being done by the International Maternal Pediatric Adolescent AIDS Clinical Trials Network 
(IMPAACT).  
 
The study will measure the amount  of remdesivir in the blood of pregnant women and non -pregnant women. The 
study will include about 4 0 wom en who are in the hospital for treatment of COVID -19 in the United States. You 
will be in this study while you are receiving remdesivir infusions and for one month after. In addition if you are 
pregnant we will collect information on your delivery and  bir th outcome. We will also collect information on 
your baby from the physical examination done on your baby by your clinical care provider on the day of your 
baby’s  birth . We may also collect breast milk from women who are lactating (making breast milk).   
 
The United States National Institutes of Health and Gilead Sciences, Inc. are paying for this study.  
 
1. The study will measure the amounts of remdesivir in the blood of pregnant women and  non-pregnant women 
being treated for COVID -19.  
 
The amount of remdesi vir needed during pregnancy to treat COVID -19 while being safe for pregnant women and 
their babies has not yet been studied. In this study, we will measure the levels of remdesivir medicine in the blood

their baby after recently receiving remdesivir, we will also measure t he amount of remdesivir  found in blood from 
the baby’s umbilical cord and compare that  to the amount of remdesivir  in mother’s  blood at the time of delivery . 
We will also try to measure the amount of remdesivir found in breast milk of women whose bodies are making  
breast milk around the time of receiving remdesivir.  
 
2. Only pregnant women  and non -pregnant women  who are eligible can join the study.  
 
If you decide to join the study, we will first talk to you about the study and collect some information about you to 
find out if you are eligible. More information about this is given in section #4 below. If you are e ligible, you can 
join the study. If you are not eligible, you cannot join the study.  
 
3. It is your decision whether or not you join the study.  
 
Deciding to join the study is voluntary (your choice). If you are eligible, you can choose if you want to join th e 
study or not.  You are free to join or not join. Your decision will have no effect on the medical care that you would 
normally receive from the hospital , including your care provider’s decision to treat you with remdesivir , or the 
cost of your care . Your access to services, and the benefits and rights you normally have, will not be affected. If 
you decide to join, we will tell you any new information from this study or other studies that may affect your 
willingness to stay in the study. You are welcome to ask questions or request more information at any time.  
 
Take your time and consider your decision carefully. If you wish, you can talk to other people about the study. 
You can bring other people here to learn about the study with you.  
 
4. Finding out if you are eligible for the study and entering the study

will collect some information from your medical records about you  and your health . If you are pregnant, we will 
collect information about your pregnancy . We will tell you if you are or are not  eligible for the study. If you are 
eligible, you will enter the study.  
 
Being in the study  
 
5. You will continue to receive care for COV ID-19. 
 
Remdesivir or any other medicines  you are receiving  are not supplied as part of this study. If you join the study, 
you will continue to be taken care of by your clinical care provider  for COVID -19. If you have already started to 
take remdesivir , you will continue to take remdesivir  if that is what your clinical care provider decides . If you 
have not yet started to take remdesivir , the decision as to whether or not to start remdesivir will be made by you 
and your clinical care provider.  Participation in this study will not change the care that you will receive. If you 
join the study and do not start remdesivir  within 7 days , your study participation will end .  
 
6. You will have medical information collected from your medical records.  
 
Information about your health , including any medications taken and any clinical laboratory test results  that you 
have,  will be recorded from your medical records. We will collect information from your medical records

after your last remdesivir infusion. We may also contact you by phone up to three times during the  month after 
your last infusion  to see how you are doing.   
 
7. If you are pregnant, we will  collect information about you and your baby at birth.  
 
If you are pregnant, information from your medical records about your pregnancy  and your delivery  will be 
collected.  For your delivery, we will only collect information from the time you start labor through one day after 
you give birth.  We will also collect information from your medical records and/or your baby’s newborn medical 
records about  the health of your baby when you deliver , and your baby’s physical examination (s) within the first 
day of life .  
 
8. You will have  multiple samples drawn to measure remdesivir in your blood.  
 
If you enroll in the study  and receive remdesivir , you will hav e blood collected while you are receiving 
remdesivir.  
 
• On one infusion day (either your 3rd, 4th or 5th infusion) , 8 samples over 24 hours  will be collected . For the 
first sample, we will draw 1 7 mL (a little over 3 teaspoons).  For the next 6 samples, at each collection  
time we will draw 2 mL ( about ½  teaspoon ) of blood, for a total of 12 mL (about  2.5 teaspoons). For the 
last sample, we will collect 11 mL (a little more than 2 teaspoons) of blood. If one is not already there, a 
small plastic c atheter (soft tube) will be placed in a vein in your arm on this day  before we start collecting 
the blood samples , so that blood can be drawn multiple times without having to stick you with a needle 
several times. The tube may stay in place until all of th e blood samples are drawn for this day.  
 
• On each  infusion day from your 2nd infusion through your 5th infusion , one 2 mL blood sample will be 
collected at the time you are having blood drawn for other reasons on that day. If no blood is drawn for 
other re asons on that day, we may try to collect this sample separately, or you may not have this sample 
collected. This sample will not be drawn on the one day you have the 8 blood samples collected over 24 
hours. Additionally , if you are still in the hospital on the second day after  completing your remdesivir 
treatment ( 2 days after your last infusion) , we will also collect this 2mL blood sample  in the same way.  
 
If you start receiving remdesivir, but then stop receiving it  before your 5th infusion, we will not collect any more 
blood samples  from you after you stop your remdesivir, but you will stay  in the study  and w e will continue to 
collect information from your medical records.  
 
9. If you are pregnant and received remdesivir close to the time you deliver, you will have blood drawn at the 
time of delivery.  
 
If you received remdesivir within 5 days before you give birt h, at or near the time of delivery, we will :  
 
• Draw one 2 mL sample from  you (about a ½ teaspoon) .  
• Draw a small amount of blood from the umbilical cord that is attached to the placenta after the cord is 
clamped , right after your baby is born. This will be used to measure the amount of remdesivir that may 
get into your baby’s blood, but this blood comes from the placenta, and not from your baby.

and if you agree, we may collect a breast milk sample.  
 
If you have recently given birth  and your body is making breast milk (lactating)  around the time you received 
remdesivir, we would like t o collect a sample (5 mL, about a teaspoon) of your breast milk. If you agree, we will 
collect this sample on the day you have the 8 blood samples taken over 24 hours, and also around  2 days after 
your last remdesivir infusion, if you are still in the hos pital at the time.  
 
You do not have to agree to provide this breast milk sample. You can still join this study even if you do not agree  
to provide this breast milk sample.

_______  I DO NOT AGREE  to have samples of my breast milk collected .  
 
 
 
 
11. Tests to determine the amount of remdesivir in your samples will be sent to a laboratory in the US that is not 
in this hospital .  
 
Tests to determine the amount of remdesivir in your samples will be done at other laboratories  in the US that have 
special tests for this. You or your doctor will not be told the  results of these tests. You will not be told the 
level of remdesivir that is in your blood  or your breast milk (if you provide it) .  
 
12. We may take you off of the study early.  
 
The study doctor  or nurse  may need to take you off the study early without your permission if:  
 
• The study is stopped for any reason .  
• We determine that staying in the study might harm you .  
• You do not start  remdesivir  within 7 days of joining the study . 
 
13. Please tell us if you want to leave the study.  
 
You are free to leave the study at any time for any reason. The care that you receive at this hospital will not be 
affected, but it is important for us to know about your decision.

Protocol Version : 10/25/17, Amendment: 4   Page 8 of 64  1.0 BACKGROUND AND RATION ALE 
 
1.1 Background  
 
Patients with advanced hematologic malignancies are incurable with conventional chemotherapy 
and often  require allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT).  The principal goals of HCT 
are to allow engraftment and development of a donor -derived immu ne system that can effectively 
produce an immunologic attack against the recipient ’s tumor cells  resulting in a  graft -versus -
leukemia  effect .  Early pilot studies  demonstrated that granulocyte colony -stimulating factor (G -
CSF) based mobilization is a relat ively safe and effective alternative to bone marrow harvesting for 
collection of hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) prior to allografting1-4.  Multiple randomized trials 
have since demonstrated an advantage of G-CSF mobilized peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC)  
compared to bone marrow (BM) for HCT .  PBSCs are associated with m ore rapid hematopoietic 
engraft ment, similar rates of acute graft versus host disease (GVHD), and higher rates of chronic 
GVHD5-10. Based on these findings, use of PBSC in HCT is now standard practice at many 
transplant centers.    
 
CD34+ stem cell content in mobilized peripheral blood product is considered the most important 
parameter of graft quality, and is recognized as a predictor of hematopoietic engraft ment after stem 
cell transplantation.  Infusion of more than 2.0 x 106 cells/kg recipient body weight (BW) CD34+ 
cells is associated with rapid and durable engraftment of recipients12-15.  Although the  optimal 
CD34+ cell dose is  unknown, a target of  5 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg actual recipient weight  and a 
minimum  a threshold of 2 x 106 CD34+cells/ kg is used at many transplant centers11. The focus of 
current research in stem cell mobilization and collection is to optimize the number of stem cells 
collected by im proving mobilization regimens and increasing the efficiency of apheresis collection 
by reducing  the number of apheresis procedures needed to meet the stem cell dose requirement for 
HCT16.   
 
Previous studies have demonstrated a highly significant correlati on between the CD34+ 
concentration in peripheral blood and the potential to collect an adequate amount of CD34+ cells 
within one or up to three leukapheresis procedures17-18. Many groups have suggested that a peak 
level of 20/ μL CD34+ cells should be considered as the threshold19.  The quality of the apheresis 
product such as the number of CD34+ cells in the graft and the presence of immune competent 
cells may also impact post -transplantation outcomes.  Ultimately, the efficiency of st em cell 
mobilization is determined by the number of apheresis procedures needed and  the success of 
transplantation20-21.   
 
1.1.1 Donors Mobilized with G -CSF  
 
G-CSF is the most frequently used single agent f or stem cell mobilization in the allogeneic 
setting.  G -CSF mobilizes stem cells from the bone marrow into the peripheral blood 
primarily by down -regulation of CXCL12 production by marrow stromal cells.   While it is 
relatively safe, G -CSF requires 4 -5 days of administration prior to collection  which may 
be inc onvenient for donors and cause absence from work during the mobilization process.  
In a retrospective study performed using data from the International Bone Marrow 
Transplant Registry (IBMTR) and European Bone Marrow Transplant ( EBMT ) Group , 
60% of donors required more than one leukapheresis procedure to collect the target number 
of CD34+ cells, and 15% required three or more9.  Surprisingly, approximately 20% of 
donors required placement of a central venous catheter (CVC) and the overall ra te of 
serious complications associated with G -CSF mobilized peripheral blood donation was 
1.1%, higher in comparison to the 0.5% rate observed following bone marrow donation.   
Protocol Version : 10/25/17, Amendment: 4   Page 9 of 64  Although  no long -term sequelae have been confirmed with short -term use of G -CSF,  there 
can be associated morbidity  including significant bone pain and rarely splenic rupture9.  
Furthermore, a small percentage of healthy donors have a poor mobilization response to 
G-CSF resulting in the need for additional apheresis collections or repe at mobilization 
cycles to collect an adequate PB SC dose23.  These challenges have prompted the evaluation 
of novel agents for stem cell mobilization with the capacity to rapidly mobilize HS Cs while 
providing a better tolerated drug administration and cell collection regimen.   
 
Plerixafor (AMD3100), an inhib itor of CXCR4, has demonstrated the ability to  rapidly 
mobilize stem cells out of the BM and into the peripheral circulation  in healthy donors and 
cancer patients previously treated with chemotherapeutic agents24-27.  Interestingly, 
compared to G-CSF mobilized cells, a higher proportion of plerixafor -mobilized CD34+ 
cells were in G 1 phase of the cell cycle and gene expression p rofiling indicated  that these 
cells were of a more primitive type than those mobilized by G -CSF28.  Animal models 
showed that plerixafor -mobilized HSCs have a higher fre quency of repopulating activity, 
suggesting an intrinsic difference in the engrafting  capacity of the mobilized CD34+ cells28-
29.  Additionally, there is evidence that plerixafor -mobilized grafts have different 
characteristics compared to grafts obtained with G -CSF11.  A phase II study of 25 patients 
receiving PBSC from HLA -identical sibling  donors mobilized with a single dose of 
plerixafor observed  a higher content of T -CD3+ and T -CD4+ cells in plerixafor -mobilized 
grafts compared to historical controls  mobilized with G -CSF30. Immune reconstitution was 
prompt despite lower numbers of CD34+ c ells and engraftment kinetics and rates of GVHD 
were not significantly different to historical controls.  The differences in graft composition 
between various mobilizing agents may ultimately influence engraftment, immune 
recovery, anti -tumor activity, and  patient outcomes.  
 
1.1.2 Critical Role of CXCR4 and CXCL12 Interaction  in Stem Cell Mobilization  
 
The interaction between CXC chemokine receptor (CXCR4) and its ligand, stromal derived 
factor -1 (CXCL12 ), plays a crucial role in hematopoietic cell chemotaxis and a dhesion to 
the BM stromal cells31-34.  CXCR4 is a member of a large family of seven transmembrane 
domain receptors coupled to heterotrimeric G 1 proteins  that is expressed on CD34+ cells .  
Binding with its only known ligand CXCL12  (also know n as SDF1 ), expressed on the 
surface of bone marrow stromal cells,  results in activation of multiple signal transduction 
pathways ultimately triggering chemotaxis22.  Experiments with neutralizing antibodies 
directed against CXCR4 or CXCL12  showed that unc oupling the CXCL12 /CXCR4 
signaling is a crucial step in G -CSF-mediated HSC mobilization33.  Targeted disruption of 
either molecule is lethal in mice, resulting in failure of HSC migration from liver to bone 
marrow, defects in B -lymphopo iesis, and cerebella r dysgenesis35-37.  Efficient mobilization 
of murine stem and progenitor cells is observed following injection of adenovirus 
expressing CXCL12  or after injection of methionine -CXCL12 , both resulting in a gradient 
of CXCL12  from BM to PB38.  Treatment of mi ce and primates with sulfated 
polysaccharides (e.g. fucoidan) results in a rapid increase in circulating CXCL12  and 
subsequent stem cell mobilization39.  These preclinical studies confirm the importance of 
CXCR4 and CXCL12  interaction in stem cell mobiliza tion and targeted disruption of 
CXCL12/CXCR4 interactions is an effective strategy for mobilization of HSCs40.

1.2 Study Agent: BL -8040  
 
1.2.1 Mechanism of Action  
 
BL-8040  (developed by BioLineRx  Ltd., formerly developed by Biokine  Therapeutics and 
known as BKT140 ) is a novel selective inhibitor of the CXCR4 chemokine receptor .  BL -
8040 is a 14 -residue, cyclic, synthetic peptide capped with an aromatic ring.  It binds and 
inhibits the CXCR4 chemokine receptor with high affinity (IC 50 4.42 nM) and has been 
shown  to be a specific antagonist of CXCR4 both in vitro  and in vivo  studies and to have a 
slow dissociation rate from the receptor.  
 
1.2.2 Pre-clinical Studies  of Safety and Toxicology  
 
Pre-clinical pharmacology, safety pharmacology, and toxicology studies have been 
conducted by BioLineRx to provide nonclinical safety and efficacy support for subsequent 
clinical trials  with BL -8040  in adult patients with hematological malignancies.  Special 
attention was paid to comparison of exposure in the safety studies with the highest systemic 
exposures reached in humans.  The mean human C max and AUC following administration 
of the highest dose (0.9mg/kg; equivalent to 0.73 mg/kg free base peptide on dry basis) in  
the clinical study BKTSC001, were found to be 820 ng/ml and 791 ng*h/mL, respectively. 
The mean human C max and AUC following  administration of the highest dose (1.0 mg/kg 
free base peptide on dry basis) in the clinical study BL -8040.02, were found to be 1090 
ng/ml and 1740 ng*h/mL, respectively.  These findings were used to compare plasma drug 
exposures between animal studies and human experience.  
 
Studies have been conducted both in rats and dogs evaluating the single dose toxicity and 
repeated dose toxic ity of BL -8040.  Acute toxicity was considered to be low in both rats 
and dogs following single dose administration.  Toxicokinetic evaluation of BL -8040 
single dose administration was examined following dose levels in dogs and a maximum 
tolerated dose (MT D) could not be defined despite pharmacokinetic data which showed 
that the exposures at 18 mg/kg were > 20 times and > 2 times higher than the exposures 
reached following administration of the highest dose (0.9 mg/kg ; equivalent to 0.73 mg/kg 
free base pep tide on dry basis ) in the clinical study BKTSC001.  Repeated dose toxicity 
studies in rats and dogs showed no histopathological organ changes and no target organ 
toxicity could be identified at exposures (AUC) several times (12.5 -fold in dogs and 13.5 -
fold in rats) higher than the exposure in humans following a single dose of 0.9 mg/kg  (0.73 
mg/kg free base peptide on dry basis) in study BKTSC001 and higher (6.3-fold in dogs and 
6.7-fold in rats)  following administration of 1 mg/kg (free base peptide on dry  basis) in 
clinical study BL -8040.02 .  Similar clinical symptoms were observed in rats and dogs from 
the first day of dosing and consisted of transient erythema and peripheral edema.  In dogs, 
the reactions were noticed from a few minutes up to approximate ly 2 hours following SC 
injection.  BL -8040 seemed to be better tolerated with repeated doses over time as the 
magnitude of the systemic reactions was less pronounced with time and not aggravated 
with increasing dose.  Symptoms occurred at exposure levels similar to those observed 
following administration of the highest dose ( 1 mg/kg) in clinical study B L-8040.02 , a dose 
reported to be well tolerated.  
 
Side effects of BL -8040 in the general toxicology studies in rats and dogs included 
anaphylactoid -type rea ctions, such as transient erythema and peripheral edema.  Both in-
vitro  and in-vivo studies indicate that BL -8040 partially activates mobilized immune cells.  
Protocol Version : 10/25/17, Amendment: 4   Page 11 of 64  In response to BL -8040, known markers of immune cell activation on granulocytes were 
altered incl uding an increase of cell surface expression of C11b, reduction of cell surface 
expression of CD62L, as well as secretion of MMP9 (a factor involved in increased motility 
of granulocytes).  BL -8040 did not have any effect on the release of pro -inflammatory  
mediators, including the cytokines TNF -α, IL -1α, IFN -γ, or ROS and NOS enzymes, in 
either in-vivo or in-vitro  studies.  Likewise, BL -8040 did not have any effect on mast cell 
degranulation in an in-vitro  study.  Taken together, these findings suggest that the transient 
reactions observed are related to the pharmacological action of BL -8040  and to the 
activation of immune cells rather than an effect on the release of pro -inflammatory 
mediators.  
 
1.2.3 Pre-clinical Studies of Efficacy  
 
Cell line studi es demonstrated BL -8040 has high affinity for CXCR4.  One study evaluated 
BL-8040 in a homologous displacement competitive binding assay with radio -labeled 125I-
CXCL12 to CHO cells overexp ressing CXCR441.  The IC 50 of BL -8040 binding to CHO -
CXCR4 cells was  2.5 nM.  An additional study further proved that BL -8040 inhibited 
CXCL12 -mediated migration of human Jurkat cells and mouse splenocytes in a dose -
dependent manner in vitro (IC 50 = 0.6 5 and 0.54 nM, respectively)42.  The antagonist 
property of BL -8040 on CXCR4 was also functionally tested in vitro , using migration 
properties of cells overexpressing CXCR4, towards the CXCL12 chemokine gradient.  The 
IC50 in these experiments was found to be of the same order of magnitude as in the 
competitive displacement m ethod (0.54 -4.42 nM).  
 
The efficacy of BL -8040 on mobilization of normal and hematopoietic stem cells was 
demonstrated by in-vivo studies in mice, where dose -dependent mobilization of WBCs to 
the peripheral blood was observed as a result o f a single inject ion of BL -804042.  The effect 
was seen in mice at a dose range of 2.5 – 15 mg/kg, equivalent to 0.2 – 1.25 mg/kg, 
respectively, in humans.  Stem cells mobilized by BL -8040 maintained 90% of transplanted 
mice for longer than 6 months and were capable of producing long -term rescue in lethally 
irradiated secondary transplanted mice, indicating that BL -8040 treatm ent yielded viable 
and healthy stem cells.  
 
1.2.4 Clinical Trial Experience with BL -8040  
 
To date, two clinical stud ies (BKTSC001  and BL -8040.02 ) have been conducted with BL -
8040 to assess stem cell mobilization, and both have been completed.  BKTSC001  
([STUDY_ID_REMOVED])  was a non -randomized, open -label, single administration, dose escalation 
study, where BL -8040 was administered to  multiple myeloma (MM)  patients undergoing 
treatment wi th chemo -mobilization and G -CSF.  Eligible subjects received a 10 -day 
mobilization regimen in an ambulatory setting according to standard MM mobilization 
treatment protocol consisting of cyclophosphamide (3 -4 g/m2), antiemetic drugs (e.g. 
Zofran) and 2 -mercaptoethane sulfonate sodium (MESNA, prophylactic treatment for 
hemorrhagic cystitis) on Day 0.  On Day 5 until the end of stem cell collection, granulocyte 
colony -stimulating factor (G -CSF) was self -administered subcutaneously (in the evenings) 
at 5 µg/kg  per day.  On Day 10, subjects received one SC injection of BL -8040 in the 
morning and G -CSF 12 hours later in the afternoon.  Stem cell collection (apheresis) was 
performed at a WBC count over 1,000 cells per 1 µL.  A total of 18  subjects were enrolled  
in this study .  BL-8040 was administered as a single SC injection to  four subjects per dose 
group.  Administration of BL -8040 was associated with a favorable safety profile, with no 
apparent trend toward risk with a specific dose.  No clinically consistent o r cumulative 
Protocol Version : 10/25/17, Amendment: 4   Page 12 of 64  abnormalities were observed for the safety parameters evaluated, including AE incidence, 
laboratory safety values, vital signs, ECG parameters or physical examinations, as well as 
Karnofsky status.  Single dose administration of BL -8040 caused  rapid mobilization of 
WBC and CD34+ stem cells in a dose -dependent manner.  Fewer apheresis  were required 
as BL -8040 dose increased.   In the highest dosage group of 0.9 mg/kg , all subjects had 
only one apheresis, with a mean of 20.9 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg collected (range: 11.5 – 26.1 
million cells/kg).  
 
BL-8040.02 ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) was a Phase I, two -part study exploring the safety, 
tolerability, pharmacodynamic  and pharmacokinetic effect of ascending doses of BL -8040 
in healthy subjects designed to support development of BL -8040 as a single agent treatment 
for hematopoietic stem cell mobilization for autologous and/or allogeneic transplantation.  
 
Part 1 (Dose E scalation) was a randomized, double -blind, placebo controlled study 
exploring the safety, tolerability, pharmacodynamic (PD) and  pharmacokinetic (PK) 
profile of BL -8040. CD34+ cell mobilization was measured in healthy subjects following 
administration of u p to two doses of BL -8040 (QD on 2 consecutive days). Each cohort in 
Part 1 consisted of 8 subjects; 6 subjects in each cohort were randomly allocated to receive 
BL-8040 (doses 0.5, 0.75 and 1 mg/kg) and 2 subjects randomly allocated to receive 
placebo. Pa rt 2 involved a single cohort of 8 subjects, who have received BL -8040 at the 
selected optimal dose level of 1.0 mg/kg. A total of 26 subjects have been exposed to study 
drug and 6 to placebo. Administration of BL -8040 was associated with a favorable safet y 
profile, with no apparent trend toward risk with a specific dose. Administration of BL -8040 
caused rapid mobilization of WBC and CD34+ stem cells in a dose -dependent manner.  In 
Part 1 of the study, at the highest dose tested of 1mg/kg, the mean WBC coun t rapidly and 
significantly rose to its peak after 4 -8 hrs; from baseline levels of 5.8 (±0.97) x 109/L to 
31.4 (± 4. 3) x 109/L at 4  hrs, to 33. 4 (± 6. 5) x 109/L at 8  hrs. WBC count remained high at 
23 hr s post the first injection, 24.8 (± 5.7). In Part 2 of the study a ll 8 subjects received a 
single dose of 1  mg/kg and approximately  3.5 hrs later underwent standard volume (18L 
target volume) apheresis.  At 3.5 hours after a single dose of BL -8040, the WBC count rose 
to a median of 32 x 103/µL (range; 29 – 39 x 103) and the CD34+ cell count to 43/µL 
(range; 27 -84/µL).  The number of CD34+ reached its peak after 24 hrs and started to 
decline slowly after 48 hrs.  Single BL -8040 administration resulted in robust collection of 
CD34+ cells in a single apheresis session. The median  CD34+ collected was 11.89 x106/kg 
(range; 5.09 - 15.23 x 106/Kg). These results suggest a potential second collection of 
CD34+ cells after 24hrs if needed without the need for second injection of BL -8040.  
 
In addition to the studies in stem cell mobilization, BioLineRx is currently investigating 
the safety and efficacy of multiple (7 consecutive administration days) escalating doses of 
BL-8040 in combination with Ara -C (Cytarabine) in adult subjects with relapsed/refractory 
acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in a Phase IIa, open -label, multicenter clinical study, BL -
8040.01 ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]).   
 
1.2.5 BL-8040 Related Adverse Events  
 
In general the most comm on AEs seen in all studies conducted with BL -8040 to date are 
injection site reactions (including pain, erythema, pruritus and inflammation) and systemic 
reactions: hives, pruritus (not at the injection site), flushing, chills, rash and urticaria. Other 
isolated AEs reported among others were paresthesia, musculoskeletal pain, headache, 
constipation, tingling and elevation of liver function test s. 
 
Protocol Version : 10/25/17, Amendment: 4   Page 13 of 64  BKTSC001  
 
In this study BL -8040 was associated with a favorable safety profile, with no apparent trend 
toward risk with a specific dose. No clinically consistent or cumulative abnormalities were 
observed for the safety parameters evaluated, including AE incidence, laboratory safety 
values, vital signs or ECG parameters, among other.  
 
All related TEAEs (13/131) wer e in the higher dose groups (0.3 and 0.9 mg/kg). 
Approximately half of them were under the SOC "General Disorder and Administration 
Site Condition". Ten out of 132 events were considered mild in intensity and 23.1% 
moderate in intensity (3/133). The Invest igator did not consider any of the severe events as 
related to the study drug.  
 
There were six SAEs reported throughout the study, affecting 4/18 subjects (22.2%); one 
subject in the 0.006 mg/kg dose group, two subjects in the 0.1 mg/kg dose group and one  
subject in the 0.3 mg/kg group. Two concurrent SAEs in a single 0.3 mg/kg subject (chest 
pain and dyspnea) were considered by the Investigator as possibly treatment related. These 
events were assessed as unrelated by the sponsor's Medical Safety Officer s ince:  (i) they 
recurred upon later treatment with G -CSF only, (ii) the events were similar to those 
anticipated with administration of G -CSF, and (iii) AEs were reported 30 hrs post injection, 
long after the drug was eliminated according to the PK profile  (BL-8040 t1/2 is 0.5 hr, see 
Table 5 -1). An additional SAE of hypokalemia occurred following BL -8040 administration 
and was determined to be unrelated by the Investigator. Upon review of the CRF, the 
Sponsor’s Medical Safety Officer assessed the hypokalem ia as severe in intensity and 
possibly related to the BL -8040. Three other SAEs (two cases of neutropenic fever and one 
case of sepsis) occurred prior to study drug administration and were anticipated side effects 
of chemotherapeutic agents applied in cond itioning for cell therapy and therefore 
determined unrelated to BL -8040.  
 
There were very few laboratory abnormalities determined to have been clinically 
significant, and fewer still post -dosing or associated with an AE. Only one laboratory result 
(hypokal emia) was considered to be possibly related to BL -8040 by the Sponsor's Medical 
Safety officer. Blood glucose and LDH tended to slightly increase post -administration, but 
were not associated with notable negative effects. Physical examination and vital sig n 
parameters were normal or stable in nearly all subjects following BL -8040 administration.  
 
BL-8040.01  
 
To date five dosing cohorts have been completed, in which BL -8040 doses of 0.5 - 1.5 
mg/kg were investigated.  A total of 22 subjects were exposed to d oses escalating according 
to the protocol’s escalation scheme. Only one grade 3 related serious adverse event (SAEs) 
of Sweet syndrome was reported and assessed as possibly related to BL -8040. The event 
was reported at the dose level 1.5 mg/kg. It is known  that Sweet syndrome occurs in 
patients with AML, and this particular patient subsequently showed progressive disease. 
According to the protocol three more patients were recruited for a total of 6 patients.  An 
independent Data Monitoring Committee reviewe d the safety data of all cohorts and 
considered BL -8040 safe and well tolerated at doses up to 1.5 mg/kg. The DMC approved 
the initiation of the dose expansion part of the study using this dose level.  
 
The 22 subjects dosed to date, reported 348 adverse events (AEs), among which 70% (242 
events) of the AEs were assessed as unlikely or unrelated to the study drug. Within the 
Protocol Version : 10/25/17, Amendment: 4   Page 14 of 64  events assessed as possible, probably or definitely related to BL -8040 (30%), 36%  (38) 
were grade 1, 53% (56) were grade 2, 9% (10) were grade 3 (1 thrombocytopenia, 1 
headache, and SAE of Sweet Syndrome, 5 injection site reactions and 2 systemic reactions) 
and 1% (1) were grade 4 (a case of neutropenia). Injection site reactions and s ystemic 
reactions were found to be the most common adverse events reported. During this study in 
order to mitigate the systemic reactions, pre -treatment with intravenous steroids and anti -
histamines was implemented in some patients according to the investi gator’s judgment. In 
addition, a new method of reconstitution was developed to enable dilution of BL -8040; and 
rotation of the site of injection at each dosing was recommended with intent to minimize 
injection site reactions.  
 
Thirteen out of 22 subjects r eported 22 serious adverse events (SAEs), only one was 
assessed as possible related and was already described above.  To date, the maximum 
tolerated dose (MTD) was not reached when treating AML patients with seven consecutive 
days of 1.5 mg/kg BL -8040.  
 
BL-8040.02  
 
No Serious Adverse Events were reported in all dose levels. All the AEs but three were 
mild or moderate , severe AEs included: transient syncope (resolved in one min), two events 
of asthenia (resolved within 15 - 30 min). Most common BL -8040 rela ted AEs included 
injections site (IS) reactions characterized by pain, edema and erythema; transient and mild 
systemic reactions (rash, chills, pruritus, urticaria, hot flashes/flushing,    
hives, hypotension, chest pain, nausea). All resolved spontaneousl y within 30 - 120 
minutes. Additional less frequent AE’s included asthenia, peripheral swelling, paresthesia, 
hyperhidrosis, tachycardia, edema peripheral, dizziness, headache and pallor. Pre -
medication with steroids  and anti-histamin es was effective in re ducing the frequency and 
magnitude of the systemic reactions.  
 
1.2.6 Rationale for Dosing and Regimen  
 
The dose of 1 mg/kg SC injection was chosen based on the safety and efficacy data from 
the BKTSC001 , BL-8040.02, and the ongoing BL -8040.01  studies.  In genera l, BL -8040 
was observed to be associated with a favorable safety profile with the most common AEs 
being injection site irritation, flushing, and itching , and systemic reactions that were 
successfully managed with premedication.  
 
In the 1 mg/kg dosage group  of the BL -8040.02 healthy volunteers study , all 8 subjects 
receiving BL -8040 single agent treatment required only one apheresis  to collect a mean of 
11.89  x 106 CD34+ cells/kg.  In the 0.9 mg/kg dosage group of the BKTSC001 study, all 
4 subjects required only one apheresis to collect a mean of 20.9 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg after 
treatment with G -CSF in combination with a single BL -8040 administration.  
 
Overall, the 1mg/kg dose selected to be used in this study was found to be safe in all st udies 
to date and highly efficacious for SC mobilization and collection in the healthy volunteer 
study.  
 
1.3 Study Rationale   
 
Current protocols use G -CSF to mobilize hematopoietic progenitor cells from matched sibling and 
volunteer unrelated donors.  Unfortun ately, this process requires four to six days of G -CSF injection 
Protocol Version : 10/25/17, Amendment: 4   Page 15 of 64  and can be associated with side effects , most notably bone pain  and rarely splenic rupture9.  BL -
8040 is associated with few side effects , is given as a single SC injection,  and collection of  cells 
occurs on the same day as BL -8040 administration.  This study will evaluate the safety and efficacy 
of this novel agent for hematopoietic progenitor cell mobilization and allogeneic transplantation 
based on the following hypotheses:  
 
1. Healthy HLA -matched donors receiving one injection  of BL -8040 will mobilize sufficient 
CD34+ cells (at least 2.0  x 106 CD34+ cells/kg recipient weight) following  no more than two  
leukapheresis  collections  to support a hematopoietic cell transplant.  
 
2. The hematopoietic cells mobilized by SC BL-8040 will be functional and will result in prompt 
and durable hematopoietic engraftment following transplantation into HLA -identical siblings 
with advanced hematologic al malignancies using various non -myeloablative and 
myeloablative  conditioning regimens and regimens for routine GVHD prophylaxis.  
 
3. If these hypotheses 1 and 2 are confirmed after an interim safety analysis of the data, then the 
study will continue and inc lude recruitment of haploidentical donors .   
 
1.4 Correlative Studies  Rationale  and Summary  
 
The ability of BL -8040 to mobilize normal hematopoietic progenitor cells will be examined via 
peripheral blood samples collected prior to the administration of BL -8040  (pre-treatment baseline 
assessment) , at 0.5 and 1 hour post BL -8040 administration , at 3 hours  (immediately before 
apheresis) post BL -8040 administration , immediately post-completion of apheresis , and 24 hours 
post BL -8040 administration  (Section  8.2).  Peripheral blood samples w ill be analyzed by CBC and 
flow cytometry to enumerate the CD34+ cells and lymphocytes that are mobilized over time on 
Day 1.  
 
Because the composition of CD34+ cell subsets , mesenchymal stem cells, NK cells,  and T cell 
subsets ma y influence recipient outcomes in terms of engraftment, anti -tumor activity, graft versus 
host disease, morbidity, and mortality, these subsets will be analyzed from samples taken prior to 
administration of BL -8040  (pre-treatment baseline assessment), at 3 hours (before the beginning of 
the apheresis) , immediately post-completion of apheresis , from the mobilized product , and 24 hours 
post BL -8040 administration  (Section 8.3.1).  
 
If a second leukapheresis is required, peripheral blood samples for CBC and en umeration of CD34+ 
cells will also be collected immediately prior to the second leukapheresis (approximately 24 hours 
after BL -8040 injection) and immediately post-completion of apheresis  (Section 8.2).   
 
The results of these studies will be used to design further therapeutic trials.

4.0 REGISTRATION PROCEDURES  
 
Donors and recipients must not start any protocol intervention prior to the signature of inf ormed consent 
Protocol Version : 10/25/17, Amendment: 4   Page 19 of 64  and registration through the Siteman Cancer Center.  
 
The following steps must be taken before registering patients to this study:  
 
1. Signature of Informed Consent  
2. Confirmation of patient eligibility  by Washington University  
3. Registration of patient in the Siteman Cancer Center OnCore database  
4. Assignment of unique patient number (UPN)  
 
Once the patient has been entered in the Siteman Cancer Center OnCore database, the WUSM coordinator 
will forward verification of enrollment and  the UPN via email.  
 
4.1 Confirmation of Patient Eligibility  
 
Confirm patient eligibility by collecting  the information listed below  and scanning and emailing it 
to the research coordinator listed in the Siteman Cancer Center Clinical Trials Core Protocol 
Proc edures for Secondary Sites  packet at least one business day prior to registering patient:   
 
1. Your name and contact information (telephone number, fax number, and email address)  
2. Your site PI’s name, t he registering MD’s name , and your institution name  
3. Patien t’s race, sex, and DOB  
4. Three letters (or two letters and a dash) for the patient’s initials  
5. Current approved protocol version date  
6. Copy of signed consent form  (patient name may be blacked out)  
7. Planned date of enrollment  
8. Completed eligibility checklist , signed and dated by a member of the study team  
9. Copy of appropriate source documentation  confirming patient eligibility  
 
4.2 Patient Registration in the Siteman Cancer Center OnCore Database  
 
Registrations may be submitted Monday through Friday between 8am and 5pm CT. Urgent late 
afternoon or early morning enrollments should be planned in advance and coordinated with the 
Washington University research coordinator.  Registration will be confirmed by the research 
coordinator or his/her delegate by email within one  business day. Verification of eligibility and 
registration should be kept in the patient chart.  
 
All patients  at all sites must be registered through the Siteman Cancer Center OnCore database  at 
Washington University . 
 
4.3 Assignment of UPN  
 
Each patient will  be identified with a unique patient number (UPN) for this study.  Patients will 
also be identified by first, middle, and last initials.  If the patient has no middle initial, a dash will 
be used on the case report forms (CRFs).  All data will be recorded with this identification number 
on the appropriate CRFs.  
 
4.4 Evaluation of Donor and Recipient  
 
Recipients will be evaluated for eligibility prior to donor study enrollment, including reviewing 
and signing the informed consent document and confirming all elig ibility criteria (except donor 
stem cell collection).  Following preliminary confirmation of recipient eligibility, donors will be 
Protocol Version : 10/25/17, Amendment: 4   Page 20 of 64  consented and checked for eligibility.  At the time a donor has been cleared for study entry (i.e., 
upon completion of the do nor’s eligibility process), a study identification number will be assigned 
to both the donor and the recipient.  This process constitutes formal study entry.   
 
Should the donor be treated per protocol (mobilization and leukapheresis) only to have the reci pient 
fail eligibility prior to transplantation (due to declining performance status, unacceptable lab 
results, or other reasons), the donor will be followed per protocol but the donor/recipient pair will 
be replaced for study evaluation.  
 
 
5.0 TREATMENT PLAN  
 
5.1 Protocol Summary  
 
This is a phase II open label study  to assess the efficacy and safety  of the CXCR4 inhibitor BL -
8040  in allogeneic transplants .  An initial cohort of 10 donor/recipient pairs will be enrolled in Part 
1 of the study consisting only of recipients with advanced hematological malignancies and their 
HLA -identical ( 5/6 or 6/6 HLA antigen matched) sibling donor s.  If there are no safety co ncerns 
regarding graft failure/rejection after the interim safety review  of these 10 Part 1 pairs , then Part 2 
of the study will open which will permit enrollment of recipients with either matched sibling or 
haploidentical donors.   During the study, we are  aiming to collect ≥ 5.0 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg actual 
recipient weight with a minimum of 2.0 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg actual recipient weight in up to two 
apheresis sessions.  The primary study endpoint is efficacy, defined as the ability to mobilize ≥ 2.0 
x 106 CD34+ cells/kg actual recipient weight.  
 
All aspects of the hematopoietic cell transplant for this study including donor selection, graft 
processing and characterization, and infusion of hematopoietic cells are to be performed in 
accordance with the sta ndards established by FACT, The Foundation for the Accreditation of 
Cellular Therapy, cGMP and GTP guidelines relating to human tissue intended for transplantation 
(21 CFR parts 1270 & 1271) and general biologic products standards (21 CFR part 610).

5.4 Mobilization of Allogeneic Stem Cell Donor  
 
Donors will be mobilized as outpatients with subcutaneous (SC) BL -8040 in the morning (Day 1) 
followed by leukapheresis approximately 180 minutes ( up to 270 min utes) after the injection per 
institutional protocol.  If the donor does not reach the collection goal for mobilization (≥ 5.0 x 106 
CD34+ cells/kg), a second leukapheresis will be performed on Day 2 ( 24 hours ± 2 hours from the 
BL-8040 injection) in an effort  to reach a total of ≥ 5 x 106 cells/kg and at least   2 x 106 cells/kg 
from the combined collections. Donors who cannot mobilize ≥  2 x 106 cells/kg after two apheresis 
section will be considered mobilization failures (See Section 5. 4.4 for information reg arding 
mobilization failure) . 
 
5.4.1 BL-8040  Administration  
 
In part 1, BL-8040 will be administered at a dose of 1 mg/kg SC injection on Day 1.   
Protocol Version : 10/25/17, Amendment: 4   Page 22 of 64  In part 2, BL -8040 will be administered at a dose of 1. 25 mg/kg SC injection on Day 1.  
 
The following procedures wi ll be performed after injection of BL -8040 on Day 1 :   
• Temperature , blood pressure, pulse, and respiratory rate will measured  at 1, 2, 3-4, 
6, and 8 hours ± 15 min following the end of the BL -8040 injection.   
• Approximately 3 hours  following injection of BL -8040  (between 180 minutes and 
270 minutes is acceptable), begin leukapheresis  procedure to process a minimum 
of three blood volumes accor ding to institutional guidelines  
• At various times pre- and post-injection ( see Section s 8.1-8.3), obtain venous 
samples for PK, CBC , and cytometric flow analysis (enumeration of CD34+ cells 
and lymphocytes, Section  8.2) and CD34+ subset analysis and T -cell phenotyping 
(Section  8.3).  At the completion of leukapheresis, a sample from the leukapheresis 
product (no more than 10% of product) will be obtained for CBC and flow 
cytometric analysis (CD34+ subset and T cell phenotype analysis, Section 8.3.2 ).  
Cryo preservation of leukapheresis product will be performed according to 
institutional guidelines . 
 
If a Day 2 leukapheresis  is needed, the following procedures will be performed:  
• Temperature , blood pressure, pulse, and respiratory rate  will be measured  
immediately before and following the leukapheresis  procedure.   
• Cryopreservation of leukapheresis  product will be performed according to 
institutional guidelines .  
• Venous samples for CBC and enumeration of CD34+ cells will be collected at 
specific time points ( Section  8.2).   
 
5.4.2 Premedication before BL -8040 Injection  
 
Premedication or treatment for local and systemic reaction will be allowed as per 
Investigator discre tion. 
• Pre-treatment of subjects prior to BL -8040 injection is allowed with the following 
concomitant medications: promethazine, hydroxyzine, diphenhydramine, 
acetaminophen, and steroids.  
• Other drugs may also be given as premedication at the Investigator’s discretion.  
• Clinically appropriate measures in case of BL -8040 related local injection site 
reactions (e.g., corticosteroids, anti -histamines, local treatments, etc .) may be taken.  
• Additional medications/therapies to manage treatment -emergent conditions wi ll be 
allowed at the discretion of the Investigator in consultation with the Manufacturer , 
in advance when possible.  
 
5.4.3 Leukapheresis  
 
Donors  will undergo no less than three blood volumes leukapheresis (LP)  starting 
approximately 180 minutes ( up to 270 minutes) after injection of BL -8040  per institutional 
protocol .  When possible, pheresis will be performed using the same model of pheresis 
machine in order to maintain consistency.  At the end of the  leukapheresis , the collected 
graft will be analyzed by standard flow cytometry for CD34+ cell content.  The goal for 
hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell collection will be  ≥5.0 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg actual 
recipient weight with  a minimum of 2.0 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg actual recipient weight .   
 
If the first leukapheresis product contains ≥ 5 .0 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg  actual recipient 
Protocol Version : 10/25/17, Amendment: 4   Page 23 of 64  weight, the mobilization with BL -8040 will be considered completed and successful.  If the 
first leukapheresis product contains < 5 .0 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg actual recipient weig ht, a 
second leukapheresis  will be performed  approximately 24 hours after the injection  of BL -
8040  (i.e. Day 2) . If the sum of the grafts collected after two days is ≥ 2.0 x 106 CD34+ 
cells/kg  actual recipient weight , the mobilization with BL -8040 will be considered 
completed and successful.   
 
If a donor  fails to mobilize a graft containing at least 2.0 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg actual 
recipient weight after two leukapheresis  procedures, mobilization will be considered 
unsuccessful.   These donors will proceed with G -CSF mobilization per standard institution 
guidelines and will be followed for safety purposes for a period of five years after receiving 
BL-8040  (Refer to Section 5.4.5) .   
 
For the transplant purposes, up to 5.0 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg actual recipient weight  will be 
cryopreserved in DMSO per Institutional guidelines and infused in the recipient. Any 
additional cells will be aliquotted and cryopreserved for future donor cellular infusions  to 
the recipient  per Institutional g uidelines .  
 
5.4.4 Mobilization Failure with BL -8040 
 
Donors are required to undergo a minimum of three blood volumes  apheresis/day  for up to 
two days (i.e. two leukapheresis proce dures ) to be considered evaluable for the primary 
endpoint.  If the donor fails to  collect ≥ 2.0 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg actual recipient weight 
due to the inability to undergo a minimum of three blood volumes  apheresis/day, the donor 
will be removed from the protocol and the donor/recipient couple will be replaced.  The 
donor will still be followed for safety purposes  according to the protocol  (Section  5.2.4 ).   
 
If the donor is able to undergo a minimum of three blood volumes apheresis/day, but  the 
sum of the two leukapheresis products is < 2.0 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg actual recipient  
weight, treatment will be considered unsuccessful (mobilization failure) .  In this case, the 
donor will be removed from protocol and will be mobilized with G -CSF according to the 
standard institutional procedures.   The donor /recipient couple  will not be replaced , but 
followed for safety purposes according to the protocol  (Section s 5.4.5 and 5.5.5 ).  If the 
patient is unable to obtain sufficient cells for transplant from the G -CSF mobilization, the 
BL-8040 product may be pooled with the G -CSF mobilized prod uct for transplant.  
Recipient outcomes will be collected and described but will not considered part of the 
primary analysis.  
 
5.4.5 Donor Follow -Up 
 
Donors will be closely monitored during treatment and mobilization with BL -8040 for 
adverse events for 5 years post-administration of BL -8040 .  AEs and concomitant 
medications will be obtained at the 30 day follow -up visit/phone call. New AEs reported 
during this period and those that are still open will be followed until resolution or 
stabilization . Adverse events will be graded according to the NCI CTCAE version 4.03.  
Hypocalcemia documented during the leukapheresis procedure is a known transient side 
effect and will not require additional follow -up unless determined to be clinically indicated 
by the treating physician .  The donor will have a CBC with differential count drawn at 7 
days and 30 days  post-completion of BL -8040 administration .  If the donor’s  CBC  has 
clinically significant changes from baseline  in the opinion of the treating physician  at 30 
days post -administration of BL -8040, the donor will continue to have CBCs drawn monthly 
Protocol Version : 10/25/17, Amendment: 4   Page 24 of 64  until resolution . Telephone contact will be made by the research st udy coordinator annually 
for 5 years .  Long term donor follow up will be performed in accordance to the consensus 
statement from the Worldwide Network for Blood and Marrow Transplantation an d limited 
to three items: survival, onset of malignancies and onset of autoimmune diseases. In the 
case of a positive reply, the level of evidence should be indicated, that is if the diagnosis 
was confirmed by medical data.43 See Section 7.1 for donor follo w-up schedule of events.  
 
5.5 Treatment of the Recipient  
 
Once it is determined that an allograft of ≥  2.0 x 106/kg has been obtained following BL -8040 
injection, the recipients may start  their transplant conditioning  regimen .  On the day of 
transplantation (D ay 0), the previously cryopreserved allograft will be thawed and infused into the 
recipient  (refer to Section 5.5 .3).   
 
5.5.1 Administration of Conditioning Regimen  
 
Once it is determined that a  sufficient  allograft has been obtained following BL -8040 
injectio n, the recipients will undergo myeloablative or reduced intensity conditioning 
chemotherapy  as per institutional guideline s.  Conditioning chemotherapy and/or radiation 
regimens permitted in this study are:  
• Fludarabine and busulfan  
• Fludarabine  and cyclophosphamide +/ - TBI 
• Fludarabine and melphalan  
• Busulfan and cyclophosphamide  
• Cyclophosphamide and TBI  
 
Additional regimens may b e allowed with approval of the P rimary Investigator.  
 
5.5.2 GVHD Prophylaxis  
 
GVHD prophylaxis will be administered to all patients per institutional guidelines.  
 
5.5.3 Stem Cell Transplantation  
 
All or part of the leukapheresis product will be infused into the recipient  per institutional 
guidelines . The day of the infusion will be considered Day 0; if the infus ion occurs over 
multiple days, the final day of infusion will be considered Day 0.  
 
On the day of transplantation (Day 0),  the cryopreserved allograft will be thawed and up 
to 5.0 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg (but not less than 2 .0 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg ) actual re cipient 
weight  will be infused into the recipient.   
 
5.5.4 General Concomitant Medication and Supportive Care Guidelines  
 
Concomitant medications and supportive care measures, such as growth factors, will be 
administered at the discretion of the treating physi cian.  
 
If the recipient requires a donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) as determined by the treating 
physician, data will be collected on the number of cells infused and all grade 3 -5 AEs (see 
Section 11.1.7 for exceptions) will be recorded from Day 0 to Day 3 0 post DLI.  
Protocol Version : 10/25/17, Amendment: 4   Page 25 of 64   
5.5.5 Recipient Follow -Up 
 
Recipients will be closely monitored for serious adverse events  (see Section 11.1.7 for 
exceptions), neutrophil and platelet recovery,  and GVHD.  These will be recorded in 
medical records and transcribed into case report forms.  Serious adverse events will be 
graded according to the NCI CTCAE version 4 .03 and all grade 3 -5 nonhematologic AEs 
will be collected from start of conditioning  through Day 100 or until relapse or start of 
subsequent treatment  for their hematologic malignancy , whichever comes first.  
 
See Section 7.2 for recipient follow -up schedule of events.  All recipients will be followed 
post-transplant regardless of relapse, s ubsequent treatment, etc.   
 
5.5.6 Failure to Engraft  
  
If any recipient receiving the BL -8040 mobilized allograft does not have evidence of 
absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of at least 500/ µL by Day + 28 following transplantation, 
the donor will be contacted to begin G -CSF mobilization immediately and the recipient 
will be treated according to standard institutional policies for engraftment failure.  The 
recipient will still be monitored for safety per pro tocol.  
 
5.6 Evaluation of Toxicity , Response , and Study Endpoints  
 
5.6.1 Donor and Recipient Toxicity Evaluations  
  
All donors who receive BL -8040 are evaluable for toxicity  (including CBC recovery) . 
 
All recipients who receive any hematopoietic cells mobilized wit h BL -8040 are evaluable 
for toxicity, hematopoietic recovery, GVHD and disease relapse.   
 
5.6.2 Donor and Recipient Response Evaluations  
 
Donors are required to undergo a minimum of 3 blood volumes of apheresis / day and up 
to two apheresis (depends on the numb er of cells collected) to be evaluable  for efficacy.   
 
Recipients who receive hematopoietic cells mobilized with BL -8040 only will be evaluable 
for engraftment.  
 
5.6.3 Evaluation of Donor/Recipient Pairs for Study Endpoints  
 
If a donor fails to collect ≥ 2.0 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg actual recipient weight  despite 
unde rgoing at least 3 blood volumes of apheresis/day  for 2 days , the donor will be 
considered evaluable, but will be consid ered a mobilization failure tha t will count towards 
the primary analysis (see Section  13.1.1 ).   
 
If a donor collect s ≥ 2.0 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg  actual recipient weight  and the recipient fail s 
eligibility prior to transplantation (due to declining performance status, unacceptable lab 
results, or other reasons), the donor will be followed for safety per protocol , but the 
donor/recipie nt pair will not  be considered  evaluable and will be replaced.  
  
Protocol Version : 10/25/17, Amendment: 4   Page 26 of 64   
5.7 General Concomitant Medication and Supportive Care Guidelines  
 
Concomitant medications and supportive care measures will be given at the discretion of the 
treating physician whenever medica lly necessary.   
 
5.8 Women of Childbearing Potential  
 
Women of childbearing potential (women with regular menses, amenorrhea, irregular cycles, using 
a contraceptive method that precludes withdrawal bleeding, or who have had a tubal ligation) are 
required to have a negative pregnancy test within 10 days  prior  to the first dose of BL -8040 (donor) 
or prior to start of conditioning  (recipient).  
 
Non-childbearing potential is defined as (by other than medical reasons):  
• ≥ 45 years of age and has not had menses for greater than 2 years.  
• Amenorrheic for > 2 years wit hout a hysterectomy and oophorectomy and an FSH value in the 
postmenopausal range upon pretrial (screening) evaluation.  
• Post-hysterectomy, oophorectomy, or tubal ligation.  
 
Donors or recipients (female or male along with their female partners) are required  to use two forms 
of acceptable contraception, including one barrier method, during participation in the study and for 
2 weeks following the dose of BL -8040 (donor) or 2 weeks following the stem cell transplant 
(recipient).  
 
If a donor or recipient is susp ected to be pregnant, BL -8040 administration to the donor and/or stem 
cell transplant to the recipient should be immediately discontinued.  In addition, a positive urine 
test must be confirmed by a serum pregnancy test.  If it is confirmed that the recipie nt or donor is 
not pregnant, the donor may resume dosing and the recipient may receive the transplant.  
 
If a female donor or recipient or female partner of a male donor or recipient becomes pregnant 
during treatment or within 1 month after the dose of BL -8040 (donor) or the stem cell transplant 
(recipient), the investigator must be notified in order to facilitate outcome follow -up. 
 
5.9 Duration of Therapy  
 
If at any time the constraints of this protocol are considered to be detrimental to the donor and/or 
recipient’s health and/or the donor and/or recipient no longer wishes to c ontinue protocol therapy, 
the protocol therapy should be discontinued and the rea son(s) for discontinuation documented in 
the case report forms.  
 
Donor and / or recipient  may be removed from the protocol treatment or study  for any of the 
following reasons:  
• Death  
• Adverse event(s) that, in the judgment  of the investigator, may cause severe or 
permanent harm or which rule out continuation of study drug  
• General or specific changes in the patient’s condition that render the patient 
unacceptable  for further treatment in the judgment  of the primary investiga tor 
• Suspected pregnancy  
• Serious noncompliance with the study protocol  
• Lost to follow -up 
Protocol Version : 10/25/17, Amendment: 4   Page 27 of 64  • Patient request, i .e. withdrawal of consent  
• Study termination by the Sponsor, Investigator or regulatory agency

• AUC 0-t - Area under the BL -8040 plasma concentration -time curve from time of 
administration up to the last time point with a mea surable concentration post dosing, 
calculated by linear up -logarithmic down trapezoidal summation  
• AUC 0-∞ - Area under the BL -8040 plasma concentration -time curve extrapolated to 
infinity, calculated as: AUC 0-∞ = AUC 0-t + Clast/λz, where C last is the last m easurable 
concentration  
• λz - elimination rate constant, determined by linear regression of the terminal points of the 
ln-linear plasma concentration -time curve  
• t1/2 - terminal elimination half -life, defined as 0.693/λ z 
 
At the following time points on Day  1, approximately 4 mL of peripheral blood will be collected 
in EDTA tube(s) for pharmacokinetic analysis:

10.0 SAFETY , PHARMACOVIGIL ANCE , AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS  
 
The entities providing oversight of safety and compliance with the protocol require reporting as outline 
below.  
 
The Washington University Human Research Protection Office (HRPO) requires that all events meeting 
the definition of unanticipated problem or serious noncompliance be reported as outlined in Section 10.2.  
Protocol Version : 10/25/17, Amendment: 4   Page 35 of 64   
The FDA requires that all serious and unexpected a dverse events be reported as outlined in Section 10.4.  
In addition, any fatal or life -threatening adverse experiences where there is a reasonable possibility of 
relationship to study intervention must be reported.  
 
BioLine RX requires that all SAEs  be repo rted as outlined in Section 10.5.  
 
10.1 Definitions  
 
10.1.1  Adverse Event (AE)  
 
An AE is defined in ICH E6 as “any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical 
investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not 
necessarily have a ca usal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any 
unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom or 
disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, 
whether or not rel ated to the medicinal (investigational) product.”  
 
An abnormal result of diagnostic procedures including abnormal laboratory findings will 
be considered an AE if it fulfills one or more of the following:  
• Results in subject ’s withdrawal by the Investigator  
• Is associated with an SAE  
• Is associated with clinical signs or symptoms  
• Is considered by the physician to be of clinical significance  
A new condition or the worsening of a pre -existing condition will be considered 
an AE.  
AEs do not  include the following:  
• Medical/surgical procedures are not AEs (e.g., surgery, endoscopy, tooth 
extraction, transfusion). The condition that leads to the procedure is an AE if the 
procedure was not planned at the Screening visit.  
• Overdose of concomitant m edication without any signs or symptoms unless the 
subject is hospitalized for observation.  
• Hospitalization for elective surgery planned prior to study (situation where an 
untoward medical occurrence has not occurred).  
• Disease progression.  
 
All AEs, whethe r observed by the Investigator or designee or volunteered by or elicited 
from the subject, should be recorded individually on an AE CRF page with the following 
information: the specific event or condition, the dates of occurrence, duration, severity, 
relationship to study medication, action taken to study drug, outcome, and whether 
considered non -serious or serious.  
 
Once the subject has signed the informed consent form (ICF), AEs will be recorded up to 
and including 30 days after the last dose of the treatment drug  for donors . AEs from time 
of consent to immediately prior to receiving BL -8040 will be captured as baseline events.  
The severity of the AE will be assessed by the investigating physician in accordance with 
the definitions below. A Serious AE must fulfill the requirements listed in Section 10.1.2. 
 
In addition, any AEs at least possibly related to study drug that occurs up to 5 years after 
the BL -8040 dose (donor) should be recorded.  
Protocol Version : 10/25/17, Amendment: 4   Page 36 of 64   
For recipients, Grade 3 -5 nonhematologic AEs will be reco rded from the start of the 
conditioning regimen until Day +100 post transplant.   
 
AE severity (Table 1) will be recorded and graded according to NCI -CTCAE (v 4.03).  
 
Table 111: Severity of Adverse Events According to CTCAE (Version 4.03)  
Grade  Description  
0 No AE or within normal limits  
1 Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations 
only; intervention not indicated.  
2 Moderate; minimal, local or non -invasive intervention indicated; limiting age -
appropriate instrumental Activities of Daily Living (ADL)  
3 Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; 
hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; limiting 
self-care ADL  
4 Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated  
5 Death related to AE  
A semi -colon indicates ‘or’ within the description of the grade.  
 
The following definitions should be used for toxicities/AEs that are not defined in the 
CTCAE:  
• Mild (Grade 1): The AE is noticeable to the subject but does not interfere with 
routine activity, no medical intervention is required;  
• Moderate (Grade 2): The AE interferes with routine activity but responds to 
symptomatic therapy or rest;  
• Severe (Grade 3): The  AE significantly limits the subject’s ability to perform 
routine activities despite symptomatic therapy;  
• Life-threatening (Grade 4): The subject is at immediate risk of death.  
The Investigator will document his/her opinion of the relationship of the AE to  
treatment with the study drug, using the criteria outlined in Table 2.  
 
The possible outcomes of the AEs are classified as follows:  
• Recovered: The subject has fully recovered from the AE with no residual effects 
observable  
• Recovered with sequelae: The su bject has recovered from the AE with residual 
effects observable  
• Ongoing: AE is not recovered  
• Fatal  
• Unknown  
 
All AEs, serious and not serious, will be recorded on the AE Case Report Form, and if 
relevant, the Concomitant Medications Record in the CRF will be updated. The 
Investigator will assess  severity  and relationship to study drug (See Table 1  and Table 2  
respectively). Particular attention should be made to ensure no discrepancies between the 
AE and the SAE form (i.e. outcome, severity, relationsh ip must be consistent).  
 
Treatment -emergent AEs (TEAEs) are defined as AEs observed after 1st dose of study drug.  
  
Protocol Version : 10/25/17, Amendment: 4   Page 37 of 64   
Table 222: Relations hip of Adverse Event to Treatment  
Relationship  Criteria  
Unrelated  The patient did not receive the study medication.  
OR 
The temporal sequence of the AE onset relative to administration of 
the study medication is not reasonable.  
OR 
There is another obvious cause of the AE.  
Unlikely  There is evidence of exposure to the study medication. However, it 
does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence from administration 
of drug.  
It does not follow a known response pattern to the suspected drug.  
It does not re -appear or worsen upon re -challe nge. 
There is another more likely cause of the AE.  
Possible  There is evidence of exposure to t he study medication.  
The temporal sequence of the AE onset relative to the administration 
of the study medication is reasonable.  
The AE could have been due to a nother equally likely cause.  
Probable  There is evidence of exposure to the study medication.  
The temporal sequence of the AE onset relative to administration of 
the study medication is reasonable.  
The AE is more likely explained by the study medication th an by 
another cause.  
A direct cause and effect relationship between the suspected drug and 
the adverse event is likely.  
It disappears or decreases upon cessation of drug administration or 
reduction in dose.  
Related  There is evidence of exposure to the study medication.  
The temporal sequence of the AE onset relative to administration of 
the study medication is reasonable.  
The AE is more likely explained by the study medication than by 
another cause.  
The AE shows a pattern consistent with previous knowled ge of the 
study medication.  
A direct cause and effect relationship between the suspected drug and 
the adverse event has been demonstrated.  
It disappears or decreases upon cessation of drug administration or 
reduction in dose.  
 
10.1.2  Serious Adverse Events (SAEs ) 
 
An SAE is any AE occurring at any dose that suggests a significant hazard or side effect, 
regardless of the Investigator ’s opinion on the relationship to the investigational medicinal 
product and which results in, but may not be limited to, any of the following outcomes:  
 
• Death (regardless of the cause)  
• A life -threatening experience  
• Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization (any inpatient 
hospital admission that includes a minimum of an overnight stay in a health care 
Protocol Version : 10/25/17, Amendment: 4   Page 38 of 64  facility)  
• A persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• A congenital anomaly or birth defect  
• Significant Medical event  
 
A life-threatening  adverse drug experience is any AE that places the subject, in the view 
of the Investigator, at immediate risk of death from the reaction as it occurred, i.e., it does 
not include a reaction that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.  
 
Inpatient hospitalization  or prolongation of existing hospitalization  means that hospital 
inpatient admission and/or prolongation of hospital stay were required for treatment of AE, 
or that they occ urred as a consequence of the event.  
 
Hospitalization for elective treatment of a pre -study condition (pre -Baseline) that did not 
worsen while on study and optional hospitalizations not associated with a clinical AE (e.g. 
elective cosmetic surgery) are not  considered SAEs.  
 
Significant medical events  are those that may not be immediately life -threatening, but 
may jeopardize the subject and may require intervention to prevent one of the other serious 
outcomes listed above. Examples of such events are intensi ve treatment in an emergency 
room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not 
result in hospitalization; such an AE will normally be considered serious by this criterion.  
 
10.1.3  Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Events (S USARs)  
 
A serious adverse event which is assessed as  related and is unexpected will be considered 
as SUSAR and should be reported in an expedite d manner (see Section s 10.8 and 10.9 ). 
 
Definitions:  
• Unexpected: a case in which in terms of nature, severity, or frequency given (a) 
the research procedures that are described in the protocol -related documents, such 
as the IRB -approved research protocol and informed consent document; and (b) 
the characteristics of the subject population being studied;  is not expected to be 
present  
• Relationship: related or possibly related to participation in the research ( “possibly 
related ” means there is a reasonable possibility that the incident, experience, or 
outcome may have been caused by the procedures involved in the research); and  
• suggests that the research places subjects or others at a greater risk of harm 
(including physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously 
known or recognized.  
 
10.1.4  Noncompliance  
 
Definition:  failure to follow any appli cable regulation or institutional policies that govern 
human  subjects  research or failure to follow the determinations of the 
IRB.   Noncompliance may occur due to lack of knowledge or due to deliberate choice to 
ignore regulations, institutional policies, study protocol, or determinations of the IRB.  
 
 
Protocol Version : 10/25/17, Amendment: 4   Page 39 of 64  10.1.5  Serious Noncompliance  
 
Definition:  noncompliance that material ly increases risks that result  in substantial harm to 
subjects or others, or that materially compromises the rights or welfare of participants.  
 
10.1.6  Protocol Exceptions  
 
Definition:  A planned deviation from the approved protocol that are under the research 
team’s control. Exceptions apply only to a single participant or a singular situation.   No 
exceptions to the eligibility criteria (Section 3.0) will be considered.  
 
Local IRB p re-approval of all protocol exceptions must be obtained prior to the event.   For 
secondary sites, the Washington University PI will issue approval of the exception, but it 
must also be submitted to the local IRB with documentation of approval forwarded to 
Wash ington University.  Washington University IRB approval is not required for protocol 
exceptions occurring at secondary sites.  
 
10.2 Reporting to the Human Research Protection Office (HRPO) at Washington 
University  
 
The PI is required to promptly notify the IRB o f the following events:  
 
• Any unanticipated problems involving risks to participants or others which occur at WU, 
any Barnes Jewish Hospital ( BJH) or Saint Louis Children’s Hospital ( SLCH ) institution, 
or that impacts participants or the conduct of the stud y. 
• Noncompliance with federal regulations or the requirements or determinations of the IRB.  
• Receipt of new information that may impact the willingness of participants to participate 
or continue participation in the research study.  
 
These events must be rep orted to the IRB within 10 working days  of the occurrence of the event 
or notification to the PI of the event.   The death of a research participant that qualifies as a 
reportable event should be reported within 1 working day  of the occurrence of the event or 
notification to the PI of the event.  
 
10.3 Reporting to the Quality Assurance and Safety Monitoring Committee (QASMC) at 
Washington University  
 
The PI is required to notify the QASMC of any unanticipated problem occurring at WU or any BJH 
or SLCH institution  that has been reported to and acknowledged by HRPO as reportable.  
(Unanticipated problems reported to HRPO and withdrawn during the review process need not be 
reported to QASMC.)  
 
QASMC must be notified within 10 days  of receipt of IRB acknowledgment via email to a QASMC 
auditor.  
 
10.4 Reporting to the FDA  
 
The conduct of the study will comply with all FDA safety reporting requirements.  PLEASE 
NOTE THAT REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FOR THE FDA DIFFER FROM 
REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FOR HRPO/QASMC.  It is the responsibility of the 
Washington University principal investigator to report any unanticipated problem to the FDA as 
Protocol Version : 10/25/17, Amendment: 4   Page 40 of 64  follows:  
 
• Report  any unexpected fatal or life -threatening adverse experiences (Section 10.1.2) 
associated with use of the drug (i.e., there is a reasonable possibility that the experience 
may have been caused by the drug) by telephone or fax no later than 7 calendar days  after 
initial receipt of the information.    
• Report any serious, unexpected adve rse experiences  (Section 10.1.2) , as well as results 
from animal studies that suggest significant clinical risk within 15 calendar days  after 
initial receipt of this information .   
 
All MedWatch forms will be sent by the investigator or investigator’s team  to the FDA at the 
following address or by fax:

FAX: 1 -800-FDA -0178  
 
Secondary sites must submit a completed MedWatch form to the Washington University PI and 
research coordinator within 4 calendar days  (for fatal or life -threatening adverse experiences) or 
11 calendar days  (for serious, unexpected adverse experiences).  Th e Washington University PI 
will be responsible for submitting all MedWatch forms from secondary sites to the FDA within the 
timeframes specified above.  
 
10.5 Notification of Serious Adverse Events to BioLineRx  
 
Initial notification of SAEs  
An initial SAE report  form must be completed and sent by fax/email to the BioLineRx Medical 
Monitor within 24 hours of the Investigator’s knowledge of the event. Any fatal or life -threatening 
event should be reported immediately, by phone, fax or email.  
 
Medical Monitor

Mobile +972 54 4709208  
Email: safety8040@biolinerx.com  
Fax: + 972 -8-642-9137  
 
The initial SAE report will be followed within 24 hours by a completed SAE report including  a 
sufficiently detailed narrative, as well as  copies of hospital case reports, results of applicable 
diagnostic tests, laboratory results,  biopsy results, autopsy reports and other documents when 
requested and applicable.  
 
Minimum criteria for a valid initia l SAE case:  
For regulatory purposes, initial SAE reports should be submitted to BioLineRx immediately and 
should include:  
• Protocol identification  
• A suspected investigational medicinal product,  
• An identifiable subject (e.g. study subject code number),  
Protocol Version : 10/25/17, Amendment: 4   Page 41 of 64  • An AE with the Investigator’s assessment of seriousness and relationship to any the  study 
drugs,  
• An identifiable reporting source i.e. Investigator contact details.  
 
Follow -up of SAEs  
A Follow -up SAE Report Form must be completed by the site (mark ed as “Follow -up report”) and 
sent to the Medical Monitor within a reasonable timeframe (an SAE Follow -up report is required 
whether or not there is any additional information to the initial report).  
The contact information for Follow -up SAE reporting is t he same as for initial SAE reports  (see 
above Section).  
 
10.6 Reporting Requirements for Secondary Sites  
 
The research team at each secondary site is required to promptly notify the Washington University 
PI and research coordinator of all reportable events (as described in Section 7.6) within 1 working 
day of the occurrence of the event or notification of the secondary site’s PI of the event.  This 
notification may take place via email if there is not yet enough information for a formal written 
report (using eit her an FDA MedWatch form if required or an institutional SAE reporting form if 
not).  A formal written report must be sent to the Washington University PI and research 
coordinator within 10 working days  of the occurrence of the event or notification of the  secondary 
site’s PI of the event.  The death of a research participant that qualifies as a reportable event should 
be reported within 1 wo rking day  of the occurrence of the event or notification of the secondary 
site’s PI of the event.  
 
The research team at a secondary site is responsible for following its site’s guidelines for reporting 
applicable events to its site’s IRB according to its own institutional guidelines.  The research team 
at Washington University is responsible for reporting all applicable events to the FDA.  
 
10.7 Reporting to Secondary Sites  
 
The Washington University PI (or designee) will notify the research team at each secondary site of 
all reportable events that have occurred at other sites within 10 working days  of the occurrence of 
the eve nt or notification of the PI of the event.  This includes events that take place both at 
Washington University and at other secondary sites, if applicable.  
 
10.8 Timeframe for Reporting Required Events  
 
Adverse events will be collected on donors from first dose of study treatment (Day 1) through the 
Day +30 visit. Adverse events will be collected on recipients from the start of conditioning  through 
the Day + 100 visit.  
 
Unexpected CTCAE grade 4 or 5 nonhematologic AEs experienced by transplant recipients must 
be reported within 24 hours of knowledge of the event.  Unexpected CTCAE grade 3 
nonhematologic AEs must be reported within 3 business days of knowledge of the event s. 
 
Expected AEs will be reported using NCI’s CTCAE Version 4. 03 at regular intervals as defined in 
Section 9.0 .

Refer to Section 1.2  
 
 
12.0 MEASUREMENT OF EFFECT  
 
12.1 Definition of Primary Efficacy Endpoint  
 
12.1.1  Adequate Allograft   
 
For the purposes of this study, an adequate allograft is defined as a graft that contains ≥ 
2.0x106 CD34+ cells/kg  actual  recipient weight collected in no more than two 
leukapheresis sessions using BL -8040 as the sole mobilizing agent  
 
12.2 Definition of Secondary Endpoints  
 
12.2.1  Neutrophil  Engraftment  
 
Time to neutrophil engraftment is measured by determining the first of 3 consecutive 
measurements of neutrophil count ≥ 500/ μL following conditioning regimen induced nadir.  
 
12.2.2  Platelet  Engraftment  
 
Time to platelet engraftment is measured by determining the first of 3 consecutive 
measurements of platelet count ≥ 20,000/ μL without platelet transfusion support for 7 days.  
 
12.2.3  Graft Failure  / Graft Rejection  
 
Graft failure/rejection will be defined as an AN C < 500 /μL  after Day 28 post-HCT and 
bone marr ow biopsy with < 5% cellularity in the absence of evidence of disease.  
 
12.2.4  CMV Reactivation   
 
CMV reactivation will be defined as a positive test for CMV viremia as determined by an 
antigenemia assay or quantitative PCR that results in the administration of antiviral 
treatment directed against CMV.  
 
12.2.5  Relapse  or Disease Progression  
 
Disease relapse occurs in recipients who entered transplant in CR.  Progression occurs in 
recipients with existent disease at transplant who meet criteria for progressive disease post -
transplant.  A recipient will be considered relapsed when there is a rec urrence of the 
original malignant disease after transplantation.  Date of relapse/progression is defined as 
the date at which the first observation of hematologic, radiographic, or cytogenetic changes 
which signify progression/relapse is made.  
 
12.2.6  Event Free  Survival  
 
An event is defined as either graft failure (Section 1 2.2.3), disease relapse as evidenced by 
Protocol Version : 10/25/17, Amendment: 4   Page 43 of 64  hematologic, radiographic, or cytogenetic changes, or death. The event free survival is the 
time from Day 0 to occurrence of the first event.   
 
12.2.7  Overa ll Survival   
 
The time from Day 0 to death.  
 
12.3 Definition of Safety Endpoints  
 
12.3.1  Acute GVHD  
 
Acute GVHD rate and severity for the first year after PBSC infusion will be assessed based 
on the Minnesota -Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Resea rch 
(CIBMTR) GVHD grading system (Appendix 1)44, 45, 46.  All grades of severity of acute 
GVHD will be collected.  
 
12.3.2  Chronic GVHD  
 
Chronic GVHD rate and severity for the first 365 days after PBSC infusion will be assessed 
based on the NIH criteria  (Appendix 2) . 
   
12.3.3  Treatment Related Mortality  
 
Death that results from a transplant procedure related complication (e.g. infection, organ 
failure, hemorrhage, GVHD) rather than from relapse of the underlying disease or an 
unrelated cause.  
                
 
13.0 DATA AND SAFETY MONITORING  
 
In compliance with the Washington University Institutional Data and Safety Monitoring Plan, an 
independent  Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSM C) report will be prepared by the study 
statistician with assistance from the s tudy team, will be reviewed by the DSMC, and will be submitted to 
the Washington University Quality Assurance and Safety Monitoring Committee (QASMC) .  This report 
will include:  
• HRPO protocol number, protocol title, Principal Investigator name, data coordi nator name, 
regulatory coordinator name, and statistician

• Early stopping rules with supporting data a nd list the number of participa nts who have met the early 
Protocol Version : 10/25/17, Amendment: 4   Page 44 of 64  stopping rules  
• Summary of toxicities at all participating sites  
• Abstract submissions/publications  
• Summary of any recent literature that may affect the safety or ethics of the study  
 
Further DSMC responsibilities are described in the DSMC charter.  
 
Until such a time as the first secondary site activates this protocol, a semi -annual DSM report to be prepared 
by the study team will be submitted to the QASM Committee beginning 6 months after study activation at 
Washington University.  
 
The study Principal Investigator and coordinator will monitor for serious toxicities on an ongoing basis. 
Once the principal investigator or coordinator becomes aware of an adverse event, the AE will be reported 
to the HRPO and QASMC according to institutional guidelines  (please refer to Sectio n 10.0) . 
 
Refer to the Washington University Quality Assurance and Data Safety Monitoring Committee Policies 
and Procedures for full details on the responsibilities of the DSMC at https://siteman.wustl.edu/wp -
content/uploads/2015/10/QASMC -Policies -and-Procedures -03.31.2015.pdf  
 
In addition, the study may be monitored by BioLineRx  or a designee.  On -site monitoring of all study 
records including source documentation may be performed to ensure accuracy and completeness  of case 
report forms.  
 
 
14.0 AUDITING  
 
As coordinating center of this trial, Washington University (via the Quality Assurance and Safety 
Monitoring Committ ee (QASMC) will monitor each participating site to ensure that all protocol 
requirements are being met; that applicable federal regulations are being followed; and that best practices 
for patient safety and data collection are being followed per protocol.  Participating sites will be asked to 
send copies of all audit materials, including source documentation.  The audit notification will be sent to 
the Washington University Research Patient Coordinator, who will obtain the audit materials from the 
participa ting institution.  
 
Notification of an upcoming audit will be sent to the research team one month ahead of the audit. Once 
accrual numbers are confirmed, and approximately 30 days prior to the audit, a list of the cases selected for 
review (up to 10 for eac h site) will be sent to the research team. However, if during the audit the need arises 
to review cases not initially selected, the research team will be asked to provide the additional charts within 
two working days.  
 
Items to be evaluated include:  
• Subjec t screening and enrollment  
• Reporting of adverse events  
• Maintenance of HIPAA compliance  
• Completeness of regulatory documentation  
• Completeness of participant documentation  
• Acquisition of informed consent  
• IRB documentation  
• Issues of protocol adherence

15.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 
15.1 Primary Analysis  
 
15.1.1  Primary Analysis Set  
 
The full analysis set (FAS) will consist of all donors having received a dose of BL -8040.  
The FAS will be the primary analysis set for all efficacy and safety analyses.  
 
15.1.2  Primary Efficacy Analysis and Sample Size Calculation  
 
We predict that approximately 90% of donors  will collect  ≥ 2.0 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg  
within two apheresis sessions.   The power analysis was performed assuming type 1 erro r 
(alpha)  = 0.025, one sided non -inferiority test  (0.7 reference (inferiority), true response rate 
of 0.9, inferiority margin = 0.001)47.  To achieve 0.9 power, a total of 24 evaluable subjects 
will be enrolled.  
 
15.1.3  Accrual  
 
Approximately 1 – 3 donor/recipien t pairs per month.  
 
15.1.4  Stopping Rules  
 
14.1.4.1 Stop ping Rule for Continuation of Study Enrollment  
  
As a stopping rule to ensure that the rate of graft failure does not exceed 5%, there 
are three planned interim looks and no more than 1 graft failure can be observed 
in the first 5 patients , no more than 2 in the first 10 patients , and no more than 2 in 
the first 15 patients .  If the number of graft failures exceeds the specified numbers, 
no further patients will be enrolled on study.  The stopping rule was determined 
using Pocock bound ary48.   
 
14.1.4.2 Stopping Rule for Enrollment of Haploidentical Donor /Recipient 
Pairs 
 
We will first enroll 10 patients with matched sibling donors.  If no instances of  
graft failure are observed among the initial 10 sibling/recipient pairs enrolled, we 
will then enroll patients with either  matched sibling or haploidentical donors.   If 
one graft failure is observed  among the initial 10 subjects , then the study will not 
enroll haploidentical donor/recipient pairs . 
 
15.2 Secondary Efficacy and Safety Analyses  
 
15.2.1  Safety Analysis  
 
AEs (all, grade (for recipients), severi ty (for donors), relatedness to study drug, serious 
AEs, and AE s leading to deaths) recorded during the study will be summarized and listed.  
Protocol Version : 10/25/17, Amendment: 4   Page 46 of 64   
Laboratory values will be summarized and categorized based on their normality status.  
Individual data listing wi ll also be provided.   
 
Data from vital signs and physical examinations will be listed and summarized.  
 
15.2.2  Kinetics of Neutrophil and Platelet Engraftment  
 
Summary of number of recipients with neutrophil engraftment by Day +2 8 along with 95% 
confidence intervals and listings will be provided.  Kaplan -Meier models will be used to 
estimate median time to neutrophil engraftment including 95% confidence intervals.  Time 
to neutrophil engraftment is measured by determining the first  3 consecutive measurements 
of neutrophil count ≥ 500/ μL following conditioning regimen induced nadir.  
 
Summary of number of recipients with platelet engraftment along with 95% confidence 
intervals and listings will be provided.  Kaplan -Meier models will b e used to estimate 
median time to platelet engraftment including 95% confidence intervals.  Time to platelet 
engraftment is measured by determining the first of 3 consecutive measurements of platelet 
count ≥ 20,000/uL without platelet transfusion support f or 7 days.  
 
15.2.3  Acute and Chronic GVHD  
 
Summary of number of recipients with acute GVHD and chronic GVHD along with 95% 
confidence intervals and listings will be provided.  If there is sufficient number of recipients 
with events additional Kaplan -Meier models will be used to estimate median times to acute 
GVHD, chronic GVHD, relapse, disease progression, and death of any cause with 95% 
confidence intervals.  
 
 
16.0 MULTICENTER REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS  
 
Washington University requires that each participating site sends its informed consent document to be 
reviewed and approved by the Washington University Regulatory Coordinator (or designee) prior to 
IRB/IEC submission.    
 
Site activation is defined as when the secondary site has received official written documentation f rom the 
coordinating center that the site has been approved to begin enrollment.  At a minimum, each participating 
institution must have the following documents on file at Washington University prior to study activation:  
• Documentation of IRB approval of th e study in the form of a letter or other official document from 
the participating institution’s IRB.  This documentation must show which version of the protocol 
was approved by the IRB.  
• Documentation of IRB approval of an informed consent form. The consent  must include a statement 
that data will be shared with Washington University, including the Quality Assurance and Safety 
Monitoring Committee (QASMC), the DSMC (if applicable), and the Washington University study 
team.  
• Documentation of FWA, signed FDA For m 1572 (if applicable), and the CVs of all participating 
investigators.  
• Protocol signature page signed and dated by the investigator at each participating site.  
 
The coordinating center Principal Investigator (or designee) is responsible for disseminating to the 
Protocol Version : 10/25/17, Amendment: 4   Page 47 of 64  participating sites all study updates, amendments, reportable adverse events, etc.  Protocol/consent 
modifications and IB updates will be forwarded electro nically to the secondary sites within 4 weeks of 
obtaining Washington University IRB approval.  Activated secondary sites are expected to submit 
protocol/consent/IB modifications to their local IRBs within 4 weeks of receipt unless otherwise noted.  
Upon t he secondary sites obtaining local IRB approval, documentation of such shall be sent to the 
Washington University study team within 2 weeks of receipt of approval.  
 
Documentation of participating sites’ IRB approval of annual continuing reviews, protocol a mendments or 
revisions, all SAE reports, and all protocol violations/deviations/exceptions must be kept on file at 
Washington University.  
 
The investigator or a designee from each institution must participate in a regular conference call to update 
and info rm regarding the progress of the trial.

(continued )opportunity to receive 4 months of therapy from the date of Randomization .
Based on the firstinterim analysis, the DMC will review the PK exposure -safety and PK 
exposure -efficacy on the composite aggregate data for a Go/No-Go decision to enroll the entire 
Phase 3study .
The enrollment will continue during the analysis .  The second interim analysi s will occur when 
approximately 276death s(70% of total 393 death sneeded for the final analysis) have 
occurred .  Based on the second interim analysis, the DMC will recommend modifying,
continuing the trial as planned ,or discontinuing the trial.
Patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to AM0010 combined with FOLFOX or FOLFOX 
alone.
Patients will be stratified by 2 stratification factors :
Prior single -agent gemcitabine therapy versus gemcitabine/nab -paclitaxel therapy
North America versus Europe versus Asia-Pacific ( APAC )
Treatment Arms:
ARM 1: AM0010 (5 µg/kg) subcutaneous ( SQ)dosed on Days 1 –5 (with rest on Days 6 and 
7) and Days 8 –12 SQ(with rest on D ays 13 and 14) plus a FOLFOX regimen (a 2-hour
infusion of dl-LV 400 mg/m2and oxaliplatin 85 mg/m2followed by bolus 5 -FU 400 mg/m2
and a 46- to 48-hour infusion of 5 -FU 2400 mg/m2) initiated on Day 1 of a 14-daycycle for up 
to 12 cycles or until disease progression by RECIST v.1.1 .  
While receiving FOLFOX during Cycles 1– 12, AM0010 at 5 μg/kg will be administered as 1 
of 2 fixed doses, either 0.4 mg for patients weighing ≤80kg or 0.8 mg for patients weighing 
>80 kg.
Patients in ARM 1 may continue on maintenance cycles with AM0010 (as shown below) .  
After discontinuation of FOLFOX in the absence of tumor progression (ie,completion of the 
planned 12 cycles or unacceptable FOLFOX related toxicity), AM0010 at 10 µg/kg will be 
administered as 1 of2 fixed doses, either 0.8 mg for patients weighing ≤80 kg or 1.6 mg for 
patients weighing >80 kg.
ARM 1: AM0010 plus FOLFOX, for up to 12 cycles or until disease progression by RECIST 
v.1.1.
ARM 1: AM0010 plus FOLFOX

(continued )ARM 2: FOLFOX alone, initiated on Day 1 of a 14 -day cycle, for up to 12 cycles or until 
disease progression by RECIST v.1.1.
ARM 2: FOLFOX Alone
Crossover of patients from the FOLFOX -only treatment arm into the FOLFOX plus AM0010 
treatment arm is not permitted.
Patients randomized to the investigational combination treatment (AM0010 plus FOLFOX) 
ARM 1 , after completion of up to 12cycles of combination chemotherapy or if experiencing 
chemotherapy intolerance (as defined as Grade 3 or 4 non -hematologic toxicity that does not 
resolve to baseline in 28 days with standard of care or hematologic Grade 4 toxicity th at does 
not resolve to baseline in 28days) , may  continue to receive maintenance AM0010 if the 
patient continues to receive clinical benefit (CR, PR, SD).
Patients may continue on treatment until they experience progressive disease, unacceptable 
toxicity, require palliative radiotherapy, withdraw consent, or their physician feels it is no 
longer in their best interest to continue on treatment .In case of toxicity due to 1 study  drug 
patients can continue receiving the other study drugs based on the Investigator’s assessment of 
risk-benefit .

ConfidentialProcedures Screening:
Screening tests and evaluations will be performed only after a written Institutional Review 
Board (IRB) -and Independent Ethics Committee (IEC )-approved informed consent is signed 
by each patient .  Procedures will be conducted within 21 days prior to Randomization unless 
otherwise noted.
Clinical evaluati on:complete medical and cancer history, baseline signs and symptoms , 
demographics, physical examination, ECOG Performance Status, height, weight, body 
surface area ( BSA )calculation, vital signs, documentation of concomitant medications
including prior a nti-cancer therapy , and obtaining pathology reports of archival tissue .
Physical examination performed as part of standard practice may be used if conducted 
within 21 days prior to Randomization and if it meets the guidelines outlined in Section 
6.7.2.
Laborato ry studies: hematology (with differential and platelet counts); prothrombin time 
(PT) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT); and comprehensive chemistry panel 
(electroly tes, renal a nd liver function tests [LFT ]), urinalysis (UA) (dipstick), and serum 
pregnancy test for females of childbearing potential .Laborator y tests performed as part of 
standard practice may be used if conducted within 21 days prior to Randomization.
Baseline tumo r assessment of all sites of disease: spiral CT with contrast or MRI (if 
allergic to contrast media )must be performed within 28 days prior to Randomizatio n.  The 
same radiographic procedures used to define measurable and non -measurable lesions must 
be used throughout the study for each patient. The RECIST v.1.1 guideline recommends 
spiral CT images for chest, abdomen, and pelvis should be performed. Scans will be 
collected following the Imaging Manual. Scans performed as part of standard practice 
may be used if conducted within 28 days prior to Randomization. Note that the initial 
scan showing progression must be used for eligibility and must be performed within 28 
days prior to Randomization.
Repeat ECOG assessment within 72 hours prior to Randomi zatio n
.
CA 19 -9
Patient- reported questionnaires (EORTC QLQ -C30 and EQ -5D-5L) data to be collected at 
baseline (Screening) and on Day 1 of ever y treatment cycle regardless of dosing 
(including patients receiving AM0010 maintenance therapy) until 30 days af ter EOT.
Randomization:
oPatient will be randomized within 21 days of their screening assessments
oAll patients must begin treatment within 3 days after Randomization .
Tumor Assessment of Response :
Spiral CT or MRI (if allergic to contrast media )scans will be performed at Week 8 (±3 days) 
and every 8 weeks (±3 days) to evaluate response to treatment by RECIST v.1.1 .  The RECIST 
v.1.1 guideline recommends spiral CT images for chest, abdomen, and pelvis should be 
performed. Patients will continue the assigned study treatments until tumor progression, 
withdrawal from the study , or in case of unacceptable toxicity to experimental treatment not 
manageable with dose modifications outlined in the protocol and/or supportive care .  Patients 
who discontinue study treatment(s) with response of CR, PR, or SD will undergo spiral CT or 
MRI scan every 8 weeks (±3 days) evaluatio ns per protocol until tumor progression .  Patients 
who demonstrate clinical progression before their scans are du e will have a scan conducted to 
document progression by RECIST v.1.1.
The first scheduled tumor response assessment will be performed at Week 8 (±3 days)after 
Randomization , and responders will have a confirmatory scan no less than 4 weeks (±3 days) 
after response has been established using the same technique as baseline scans.
In treatment ARM 1, t o mitigate the chance of detecting false progression (ie, 
pseudoprogression) early in the course of treatment with AM0010 in combination with 
AM0010

ConfidentialProcedures 
(continued)FOLFOX , patients w hose scans show radiographic progression in the absence of clinical 
deterioration ,including worsening ECOG PS ,may remain on study treatments and an 
additional scan should be obtained 4 weeks ( ±3 day s) later as outlined in Section 8.1.1 .  If this 
subsequent scan shows disease progression, the patient will be discontinued from study
treatment sand followed for survival.
All o n-study spiral CT/MRI scans for all patients enrolled on the study will be collected 
prospectively and submitted to a central imaging reader for archiving .  These scans may be 
reviewed at a later time at the request of Lilly based on the criteria above .
End of Treatment (EOT) and Follow -Up Visits ( 30 days after EOT Visit ):
All patients must have the EOT visit and Follow -Up visit 30 days after EOT visit with the 
procedures conducted as described in the proto col and schedule of events .
In this event -driven study , it is critically  important for patients to continue to be followed for 
survival every 8weeks for 12 mo nths and ever y 12weeks thereafter viarecord review and/or
telepho ne contact .
Assessments of 
SafetySafety and tolerability will be monitored through continuous reporting of adverse events (AEs) 
and serious adverse events (SAEs).  Safety will be assessed by ph ysical examination , standard 
clinical and laboratory tests (hematology, blood chemistry, and coagulations), and incidence of 
patients expe riencing dose modifications, dose interruptions, and/or premature discontinuation 
of study drugs with reasons for study drug discontinuation.  All AEs will be assessed for the 
relatio nship to study treatments, and the toxicity grade will be defined by National Cancer 
Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events ( NCI CTCAE )v4.03.
Assessments of 
PK/ADAPK blood samples will be collected from patients on ARM 1and ADA samples on ARM s 1 
and2.  Patients must give their permission to obtaining the PK/ADA blood samples as outline d
inthe ICF .  Within each 14- day cycle (with the first day of dosing designated as Day 1
).  
Blood samples will be obtained as follows: 
Cycles 1 and 2, Day s 1 and 13
Cycle 3 Day  1 Only
Cycle 4 Day  13 Only  
Cycle 5 Day  1 Only
EOT and follow -up visit 30 days after EOT (ADA only) .
In the event the clinical site business hours , weekends ,or holiday schedule lead to missed
PK/ADA time points , these time points will not need to be made up on a different day .
Assessments of 
EfficacyOverall survival will be assessed from the date of Randomizatio n.
Tumo rs responses will be assessed by RECIST v.1.1 criteria (eg, spiral CT or MRI, if allergic 
to contrast media) at baseline, Week 8 (±3 days), and then every 8 weeks (±3 days) regardless 
of cycle number and regardless of any dose interruptions .  Confirmatory scans will be 
conducted in patients who have PR or CR no less than 4 weeks (±3 days) after a response has 
been established using the same technique as baseline .  If clinical progression of disease is 
observed, a spiral CT or MRI scan will be obtained to confirm disease progression .  CA19-9 
and other exploratory biomarkers will be obtained to determine correlation with efficacy 
outcomes .  Scans will be archived for possible evaluation by a blinded, centralized 
independent radiology review u sing the RECIST v.1.1
at a later time .  The time of this review 
will be determined by Lilly based on achieving the primary survival endpoint.
Sample Size Approximately 566 patients will be randomized to the 2 arms in a 1:1 ratio to observe at least 
393 death s.  Assuming a median OS time for the FOLFOX arm of 5.9 months, 393 death s are 
needed to detect a 35% increase in survival with 85% power using a log -rank test ( 2-sided) 
with an overall type 1 error (2-
sided) of 0.05, which corresponds to a median survival of 8 
months in the AM0010 in combination with FOLFOX arm (HR=0.7375) .
Interim and Two interim analyses are planned.  The first interim analysis will be conducted once a t least 60
AM0010
Clinical Protocol AM0010 –301 (Sequoia) Amendment 3.0 Page 12of 141
ConfidentialFinal Analyses randomized patients have had the opportunity to receive 4 months of therapy .  The purpose of 
the first interim analysis is to evaluate PK exposure -safety and to perform a PK exposure -
efficacy analysis to derive a Go/No-Go decision .  The criteria for Go/No-Go decision will be 
developed with the DMC and incorporated into the DMC charter .  This interim analysis is not 
designed to stop the study early  for outstanding efficacy .  Based on review of the PK 
exposure -safety and PK exposure -efficacy on the aggregated data of composite efficacy 
endpoints , the DMC will recommend continuing the trial, amending the study protocol, or 
stopping the study .  The study will continue to enroll while this analysis is being completed.
Asecond interim analysis will occ ur after approximately 276 deaths ( 70% of the 393required 
death sfor final analysis) have occurred .  The purpose of this interim a nalysis is to evaluate the 
safety and efficacy with the possibility of claiming superiority.
The final analysis will be conducted when at least 393 death soccur .
Statistical 
Methods Efficacy 
AnalysesThe primary efficacy analyses will be performed based on the Intent -to-Treat (ITT) population . 
Sensitivity analyses of all efficacy endpoints based on the Per-Protocol population will also be 
performed to confirm results obtained using the ITT population .
The primary efficacy endpoint is overall survival in this Phase 3 study .  
Overall survival will be compared in the 2 randomized treatment arms at the interim and final
analy ses using a 2-sided log -rank test, stratified by 2 IVRS stratification factors: prior 
gemcitabine -containing regimen ; gemcitabine versus gemcitabine/ nab-paclitaxel and North 
America versus Europe versus APAC
.  Patient survival will be summarized by median 
survival time and 95% CI based on the Kaplan -Meier metho d.  Progression -free survival will 
be summarized in the same manner as overall survival .  Objective response rate will be 
summarized and compared using a Cochran -
Mantel -Haen szel 2-sided test st ratified by the 
Randomization stratification factor s.
Statistical 
Methods Safety 
AnalysesThe safety population includes all randomized patients who received at least 1 dose of study 
drug.  Study treatment exposure and compliance will be summarized.
AEs will be summarized in terms of treatment -emergent events defined to be any event that 
begins or worsens in grade after Randomization through 30 days after the last dose of study 
drug.  Descriptive statistics of safety will be presented using National C ancer Institute (NCI) 
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v 4.03by treatment arm .  All 
treatment emergent AEs, drug -related AEs, SAEs, and drug- related SAEs will be tabulated 
using worst grade per NCI CTCAE v4.03 criteria by system organ class and preferred term .  
On-
study lab parameters including hematology and chemistry will be summarized using the

CommitteeAn independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will be established with the responsibility 
of safeguarding the interest of the study participants .  The DMC will review safety data 
regularly  during the conduct of the study as well as evaluate data from the firstinterim analysis
to recommend continuing the Phase 3 study , ame nding the study protocol, or stopping the 
study .  The Go/ No-Go decision recommendation on the firstinterim analysis will be based on 
a review of the PK exposure -safety and PK exposure -efficacy on the aggregated data of 
composite efficacy endpoints from the first 60randomized patients who have had the 
opportunity to receive 4 months of therapy from the date of Randomization .  The DMC will 
also review the second interim analysis after approximately 276 death s(70% of the 393 death s 
required for the final analysis ).  Based on the second interim analysis, the DMC will 
recommend continuing the trial as planned ,discontinuing the study, or amending the study
protocol .  In addition, safety reviews will be conducted by the DMC according to the 
frequency  specified in the DMC charter (see the DMC Charter of Organization for details of 
DMC responsibilities) .

Confidential1.0 INTRODUCTION AND RATIONALE
1.1 Introduction
1.1.1 Pancreatic Cancer
Pancreatic Cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer -related death in Europe and the United States 
(Siegel, Miller et al. ,2015 ), (Malvezzi, Bertuccio et al. , 2013).  It was estimated that 48,960 new 
cases would be diagnosed and that 40,560 patients would die in 2015 .  The 5 -year survival rate for 
this disease is less than 5% (Rahib, Smith et al. , 2014) .  The first -line standard -of-care (SOC) for 
patients with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer has been sin gle-agent 
gemcitabine from 1993–2013.  In patients with locally advanced or metastatic stage disease, modest 
improvements in survival have recently been attained with FOLFIRINOX (folinic acid, 5 –
fluorouracil [5 -FU], irinotecan, and oxaliplatin) ,or albumin -bound paclitaxel (nab -paclitaxel) plus 
gemcitabine chemotherapy (Conroy, Desseigne et al. ,2011 ), (Von Hoff, Ervin et al. , 2013).  A factor 
limiting the efficacy of treatment of pancreatic cancer is impaired drug delivery as a result of the 
unique desmoplastic response –the pervasive growth of dense fibrous tissue around the tumor that 
occurs in pancreatic duct adenocarcinoma (PDAC) .  Single-agent gemcitabine remains the SOC 
treatment for patients with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Grade 2 Performa nce 
Status (PS) (Sultana, Smith et al. , 2007).  Multiple randomized Phase 3 trials have failed to show any 
improvement in survival with chemotherapy doublets that included gemcitabine or with the addition 
of targeted therapies to gemcitabine chemotherapy (Philip, Benedetti et al. , 2010) , (Van Cutsem, van 
de Velde et al. , 2004) , (Kindler, Niedzwiecki et al. ,2010 ), (Philip, Benedetti et al. ,2010 ), (Van 
Cutsem, Vervenne et al. , 2009) , (Kindler, Ioka et al.,2011 ), (Goncalves, Gilabert et al. , 2012) , 
(Rougier, Riess et al. , 2013).  T he epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibit or 
(TKI) erlotinib in combinat ion with gemcitabine gained regulatory approval following a 12 -day 
improvement in median survival compared with gemcitabine alo ne in a large, randomized Phase 3 
study, which is arguably not clinically meaningful for most patients and therefore erlotinib is not 
widely used in this disease (Moore, Goldstein et al. ,2007 ).
Two positive randomized trials in first -line setting have been reported in patients with advanced -stage 
pancreatic cancer .  First, the PRODIGE -III trial(Conroy, Desseigne et al .,2011 )randomly assigned 
patients with metastatic disease to receive either FOLFIRINOX or gemcitabine .  Enrol lment was 
limited to patients < 75years of age with ECOG Grade 0–1 PS.  The median survival in the 
FOLFIRINOX cohort wa s 11.2 mont hs compared with 6.8 mont hs in the gemcitabine control arm 
(HR 0.57; p< 0.001) .  Although FOLFIRINOX was associated with a worse toxicity profile than 
AM0010
Clinical Protocol AM0010 –301 (Sequoia) Amendment 3.0 Page 22of 141
Confidentialgemcitabine, patients who received FOLFIRINOX reported an improved quality of life, probably due 
to delayed disease progression (Gourgou -Bourgade, Bascoul -Mollevi et al. , 2013).  Of note, the 
media n dose intensity of FOLFIRINOX in the investigational arm was 80% of the dose per protocol .  
Reports from institutions suggest that modified schedules of FOLFIRINOX are often favored, with no 
apparent detrimental effect on efficacy (Faris, Blaszkowsky et al. , 2013) , (Gunturu, Yao et al. ,2013 ).
The second randomized study that reported an advance in the treatment of metastatic pancreatic 
cancer was the MPACT trial(Von Hoff, Ervin et al. ,2013 ).  In this study , an improvement in survival 
was achieved with nab -paclitaxel plus gemcitabine compared with single -agent gemcitabine 
(8.7mont hs versus 6.7 months, HR 0.72; p <0.0001) .  Unlike the PRODIGE- III trial, the MPACT trial
included a small subset of patients (7%) of those enrolled with ECOG Grade 2 PSfor whom no 
survival benefit of combined therapy was observed, consistent with previous evidence suggesting that 
gemcitabine doublets provide no benefit to patients with ECOG Grade 2 PS(Heinema nn, Boeck et 
al., 2008).
Second -line therapy in pancrea tic cancer was uncommon in the past .  However, data showed that the 
combination of 5- FU/leucovorin (LV) and oxaliplatin (OFF) significantly prolongs overall survival 
(OS) by 2.52 months compared to be st supportive care (p =0.0008) and compared to 5- FU (Pelzer, 
Schwaner et al. , 2011 , Oettle, Riess et al. , 2014).  Second -line therapy with gemcitabine can be 
beneficial for patients who were previously treated with FOLFIRINOX (Conroy, Desseigne et al. ,
2011).  T here are many small trials with various single agents and, in general, the data demonstrate a 
media n progression -free survival (mPFS) of 3 months and a median OS of up to 6 months for 
second -line treatments .  Ther e is no standard of care for second -line tr eatment of these patients .  
FOLFOX second -line treatment is a reasonable option for patients with pancreatic cancer progressing 
after gemcitabine chemotherapy .  Zaanan et al. published a paper summarizing the data for FOLFOX 
as second -line chemotherapy in patients with pretreated metastatic pancreatic cancer from the 
FIRGEM study (Zaanan, Trouilloud et al. ,2014 ).  Among 46 patients who received second -line 
chemotherapy, 27 patients were treated with FOLFOX after progression to first -line gemcitabine 
alone (n=20) or FOLFIRI alternating with gemcitabine (n =7).  Grade 3 adverse events (AEs) were 
observed in 33% of the patients (no Grade 4 AEs) .  At the end of follow -up, all patients had 
progr essed and 25 had died .  Ther e wer e no objective responses (ORs) observed, and the disease 
control rate (DCR) was 36% .  Media n PFS and OS were 1.7 and 4.3 months, respectively .  For 
patients with ECOG PSof 0–1 versus 2 –3, the median PFS was 3.0 versus 1.2 months (p =0.0002) ,
and median OS was 5.9 months versus 2.6 months (p =0.001), respectively .  This indicated that 
FOLFOX has an acceptable safety profile in metastatic pancreatic cancer patients with a good ECOG 
AM0010
Clinical Protocol AM0010 –301 (Sequoia) Amendment 3.0 Page 23of 141
ConfidentialPS.  FOLFOX therapy after tumor progression on or after first-line therapy with gemcitabine or 
gemcitabine/nab- paclitax el achieved a mOS of 4.5 or 6.4 months in the second line respectively 
(Chior ean, Von Hoff , Tabernero et al. ,2016 ).
Most recently , 5-FU/LV v ersusFOLFOX for the second -line therapy of pancreatic cancer following 
gemcitabine -based regimen was investigated in the PANCREOX trial .  The primary endpoint for the 
study was PFS .  There was no difference in PFS observed between the 5 -FU/LV and the FOLFOX 
arms.  The study was terminated early, due to slow enrol lment .  In the PANCREOX study (n =108), 
the 5-FU/LV arm  showe d an unexpected survival of 9.9 months versus6.1 months in the FOLFOX 
arm.  Twenty-three percent ofthe5-FU/LV patients received additional subsequent chemotherapy 
including FOLFOX or FOLFIRINOX after progression .  This is compared with 8% of the FOLFOX 
patients, who only received monotherapy in the third line .  The 5-FU/LV observed survival is 
unexpected compared to the data from several peer reviewed, published randomized trials, including 
the NAPOLI study (n =417) .  This unexpected outcome is possibly a result of the crossover of these 
patients to other treatments that confound any interpretation of the comparative survival data .  In 
addition, there was a patient imbalance in disease characteristics and disease burden between the 2 
arms
.  Since the majority of trials investigating 5 -FU in pancrea tic cancer consistently report an OS
with 5 -FU/LV of approximately 4 months both in first -and second line-treatment ,the PANCREOX 
trial is considered an outlier by many experts in the pancreatic cancer field (Gill, Ko et al. , 2016).
Recently, the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA )approved nanoliposomal irinotecan in 
combination with 5- FUand folinic acid as second -line therapy after a previous gemcitabine -based 
therapy (NAPOLI -1) randomized Phase 3 study (Wang -Gillam, Li et al. ,2016 ).  This was a 3-arm
trial,and patients received either nanoliposo mal irinotecan monotherapy (120 mg/m2) ever y 3weeks
or nanolipos omal irinotecan monotherapy (80mg/m2) in combination with fluorouracil and folinic 
acid every 2 weeks .  The third arm was fluorouracil/ folinic acid alone .  The median OS did not differ 
between patients as signed nanoliposomal irinotecan monotherapy and those allocated to fluorouracil 
and folinic acid at 4.9 months versus 2 months (p =
0.94), respectively .  The media n OS for the 
combination of nanoliposomal irinotecan with folinic acid and 5 -FUwas 6. 1mont hs with a hazard 
ratio (HR) of 0.67 (p=0.012 ) relative to folinic acid and 5 -FUalone .  Nanoliposomal iri notecan plus 
folinic acid and 5- FUincreased survival and had a manageable safety profile as second -line therapy 
of metastatic pancreas cancer pati ents who pr eviously received gemcitabine -based therapy.
The inclusion of an immune -oncology biological to an established chemotherapy regimen (eg, 
AM0010 -001 plus FOLFOX) may result in additional/additive treatment -emer gent adverse eve nts

Confidentialtreatment wit h PEGylated IL -10 remained tumor -free and developed a protective immune memory 
against the tumor .  AM0010 stimulates the cytotoxic activity of murine or human peripheral CD8+T
cells and the expression of cytotoxic enzymes and interferon gamma ( IFNγin memor y CD8+Tcells.
Further details on the pre -clinical pharmacology of AM0010 can be found in the Investigator ’s 
Brochure (IB).
1.2.2 Toxicology
Good Laboratory Practices ( GLP )toxicology studies with AM0010 were performed in CD -1 mice 
(rodent species) and cynomolgus monkeys (non -huma n primate species –NHP) .  These studies 
involved daily subcutaneous ( SQ)administration for up to 28 days at doses up to 100 and 
1000 μ g/kg/day in monkeys and mice, respectively.
Effects seen in the studies with AM0010 were predominantly confined to NHP; the 
no-observed -adverse -effect level (NOAEL) in the mouse was considered 1000 μg/kg/day .  Changes 
in red blood cell (RBC) parameters (decreased RBC counts, hemoglobin and hematocrit, and 
increased reticulocyte counts) consistent with a regenerative anemia due to extravascular he molysis 
was evident following 2 weeks of dosing at doses ≥20 μ g/kg/day .  These changes resolved following 
the cessation of t reatment (100 μ g/kg/day) or continued dosing (doses >20 μ g/kg/da y).  Other 
findings consistent with previous experience with rHuIL -10 included a mild to moderate decrease in 
the albumin and the albumin -to-globulin ratio .  In monkeys, no effects upon cardiovascular, 
respiratory, or neurological parameters were noted at any dose .  The NOAEL and highest non-
sever ely toxic dose (H NSTD) in the monkey was 20 μg/kg/day.
In summary, the non- clinical toxicology program for AM0010 supports the continuation of clinica l 
trials in huma ns.
Further details on the non -clinical toxicology of AM0010 can be found in the IB.
1.2.3 Non-Clinical Pharmacokinetics
The pharmacokinetics/toxicokinetics (PK/TK) of AM0010 were evaluated in CD1 mice and 
cynomolgus monkeys in non- GLP pharmacokinetic studies and further evaluated in GLP 
toxicokinetic studies in both species. PEG -rHuIL -10 showed a half-life ( t½)of approximately 
10hours in cynomolgus monkeys, compared with a t ½of rHuIL- 10 of approximately 2.5 hours.

Clinical Protocol AM0010 –301 (Sequoia) Amendment 3.0 Page 29of 141
ConfidentialSerum concentrations of AM0010 remained stable throughout the duration of dosing .  No significant 
accumulation or attenuation of AM0010 levels was obser ved after the first week of dosing .  The 
absence of high-titer anti -drug antibodies (ADAs) was confirmed in all patients tested.
An interim PK analysis has been conducted on the data available from 1 93patients in AM0010 -001.  
These patients received extended treatment with AM0010 ,and samples were obtained intermittently 
throughout their treatment course .  
1.AM0010 in the serum is cumulative, reaching steady-state conditions after approximately 1 
week of daily dosing.
2.Tmaxfollowing a single dose of AM0010 is approximately 12 hours.
3.The median absorption t½is 8.16 hours, the median elimination t½is 19.2 hours.
4.Apparent clearance (the sole determinant of area -under -the-curve) is proportional to weight, 
supporting a weight -normalized dosing regimen.
5.Apparent clearance (and, to a lesser extent, distribution volume) was smaller in patients
assigned to higher -dose cohorts (values ranged from 1 –40µg/kg/dose).
None of the other covariates evaluated (age, gender, race, organ function, chemotherapy regimen)
appear to influence the PK parameters .  
The serum concentration of AM0010 was also evaluated after escalating doses of AM0010 in 
combination with FOLFOX chemotherapy .  The analysis did not reveal a significant dif ference from 
AM0010 monotherapy.
1.2.5 Safety o f AM0010
Clinical 1.2.5.1
A summary of safety events of special interest is provided below .  For more information on the safety 
profile of AM0010 ,please refer to the most recent IB.
1.2.5.1.1 Hematologic Adverse Events
The safety and efficacy of rHuIL -10 was previously studied in normal patients and patients with 
inflammatory diseases (Fedorak, Gangl et al. ,2000) .  rHuIL -10 was well tolerated .  In those clinical 
studies, rHuIL -10 induced a transient reduction in platelet counts and anemia, resulting in lower 
hema tocrit/hemoglobin (HCT/Hg b) levels .  The transient thrombocytopenia did not lead to an 
increased frequency of bleeding.

Confidential1.3.3 Rationale for Evaluating CA 19-9
A biological marker widely used in cl inical practice in the assessment and follow -up of patients with 
pancreatic cancer is CA19-9.  A strong correlation between marker decline during chemotherapy and 
patient outcomes has been observed, particularly in patients with metastatic pancreatic canc er.  In the 
Phase 3trialof ABI- 007 in combination with gemcitabine for advanced adenocarcinoma of the 
pancreas , remarkable decreases of CA 19-9 were observed (Von Hoff, Ervin et al. , 2013).  A total of 
61% in the nab -paclitaxel cohort had a decrease of at least 20% in CA 19 -9.  Patients with at least 
90% decr ease in CA19-9 levels lived 13.5 months .  In a recent publication by Chior ean et al, CA 19-
9decreases at 8 weeks are predictor sof OSin a randomized Phase 3 study (MPACT) of weekly nab -
paclitaxel plus gemcitabine versus gemcitabine alone in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer 
(Chior ean, Von Hoff et al. , 2016).  Since CA19-9 is being used only in an exploratory evaluation to 
deter mine whether there is a correlation with efficacy outcomes, increases in CA 19 -9levels in this 
study should not be used as evidence for progressive disease or for discontinuing patients from study
treatment.

Confidential2.0 STUDY OBJECTIVES AND INVES TIGATIONAL PLAN
2.1 Study Objectives
2.1.1 Primary Objective
To compare the efficacy of AM0010 in combination with FOLFOX versus FOLFOX alone in patients 
with metastatic pancreatic cancer as measured by OS .
2.1.2 Secondary Objectives
The se condary objectives are :
To compare the efficacy of AM0010 in combination with FOLFOX versus FOLFOX alone in 
patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer as measured by:
oPFS
oObjective response rate (ORR ), DCR, and duration of response ( DoR ) byResponse 
Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors ( RECIST )v.1.1
o1-year survival rate
To compare the safety and tolerability of AM0010 in combination with FOLFOX versus 
FOLFOX alone
2.1.3 Exploratory Objectives
To explore biomarkers that may correlate with tumor response, immune activation, and 
relationships to clinical efficacy outcomes.
To explore associations between patient -reported symptoms, functioning, and global health 
status/QoL using the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Q uality of 
Life Core 30 -item ( EORTC QLQ -C30)questionnaire as well as current health status and the 
EuroQoL 5 -dimension ( EQ-5D
)Index used in the economic evaluation of health care using the 
EuroQoL 5 -dimension 5 -level ( EQ-5D-5L) questionnaire .
2.2 Study Design
This is a randomized, open label, global Phase 3 Study of AM0010 in combination with FOLFOX 
compared with FOLFOX alone as second -line therapy in patients with advanced metastatic pancreatic 
cancer that has progressed during or following a first -line gemci tabine- containing regimen.
AM0010
Clinical Protocol AM0010 –301 (Sequoia) Amendment 3.0 Page 44of 141
ConfidentialApproximately 566 patients will be randomized .  Two interim analyses are planned .  The first interim 
analysis will be performed when at least 60 randomized patients have had the opportunity to receive 4
months of therapy from the date of Randomization .  Based on the first interim analysis, the Data 
Monitoring Committee ( DMC )will review the PK exposure -safety and PK exposure -efficacy on the 
composite aggregate data for a Go/ No-Go decision to enroll the entire P hase 3 study .  The enrollment 
will continue during the analysis .  The second interim analysis will occur when approximately 
276deaths (70% of total 393 deaths needed for final analysis) have occurred .  Based on the second 
interim analysis, the DMC will recommend modifying, continuing the trial as planned , or 
discontinuing the trial.
Patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to AM0010 combined with FOLFOX or FOLFOX alone.
The randomization will be stratified by 2 stratification factors:
Prior single -agent gemcitabine therapy versus gemcitabine/nab -paclitaxel therapy
North America versus Europe versus APAC .
Treat ment Arms:
ARM 1: AM0010 (5 µg/kg) SQ dosed on Days 1 –5 (with rest on Days 6 and 7) and Days 8-12 SQ 
(with rest on Days 13 and 14) plus FOLFOX ( dl-LV 400 mg/m2and oxaliplatin 85 mg/m2followed 
by bolus 5 -FU 400 mg/m2and a 46 -to 48 -hour infusion of 5 -FU 2400 mg/m2) initiated on Day 1 of a 
14-day cycle, for up to 12 cycles or until disease progression by RECIST v.1.1.
While receiving FOLFOX during C ycles 1 –
12, AM0010 at 5 μg/kg will be administered as 1 of 2 
fixed doses , either 0.4 m g for patients weighing ≤80
kg or 0.8 mg for patients weighing >80 kg.
Patients in ARM 1 may continue on maintenance cycles with AM0010 (as shown below) .  After 
discontin uation of FOLFOX in the absence of tumor progression (ie,completion of the planned 12 
cycles or unacceptable FOLFOX related toxicity), AM0010 at 10 µg/kg will be administered as 1 of 2 
fixed doses , either 0.8 m gpatients weighing ≤80 kg or 1.6mgfor patients weighing >80 kg.

2.2.1 Treat ment Duration
Each cycle is 14 days, with Days 6, 7, 13, and 14 being rest days for AM0010 .  FOLFOX will be
administered on Day 1 of each cycle .  Patients randomized to the investigational combination 
treatment (AM0010 plus FOLFOX) ARM 1 , after completion of up to 12 cycles of combination 
chemotherapy or if experiencing chemotherapy intolerance (as defined as Grade 3 or 4 
non-hematologic toxicity that has not resolved to baseline in 28 days or Grade 4 hematologic toxicity 
that has not resolved to baseline in 28 days) may continue to receive maintenance AM0010 if the 
patie nt continues to receive clinical benefit (CR, PR, or SD).  Patients may receive FOLFOX on both 
study arms for up to 12 cycles or 24weeks .  Patients will be treated until tumor progression by 
RECIST v. 1.1.
Patients may continue on treatment until they expe rience progressive disease, unacceptable toxicity, 
require palliative radiotherapy, withdraw consent, or their physician feels it is no longer in their best 
interest to continue on study treatments.
To mitigate the chance of detecting false -progression (ie, pseudoprogression) early in the course of 
treatment on ARM 1 with AM0010 in combination with FOLFOX , patients whose scans show 
radiographic progression in the absence of clinical deterioration including worsening ECOG PSas 
assessed by the Investigator m ay remain on study treatments and should have an additional scan 4

the patient will be discontinued from study treatments .
2.2.2 Evaluation of Molecular Biomarkers
Carbohydrate CA 19 -9 2.2.2.1
Serum levels of CA 19 -9 will be evaluated over time to assess changes after treatment with AM 0010 
plus FOLFOX and FOLFOX alone .  Since CA 19 -9 is being used only in an exploratory evaluation to 
deter mine whether there is a correlation with efficacy outcomes, increases in CA 19- 9 levels in this 
study should not be used as evidence for progressive disease or for removing patients from study
treatment s.
Other Exploratory Molecular Markers 2.2.2.2
The following additional optional biomarkers may be quantified and correlated with subsequent anti -
tumor responses: i) Pre-treatment intratumoral CD8+ T cells and M HCI expression levels in archival 
tumor samples may be quantified to determine if a pre -treatment intratumoral immune signature 
effects AM0010 treatment outcomes; ii)Treatment -associated changes in the serum biomarkers IL -
18, IFN γ, IL-4,and transforming growth factor -beta (TGF β)may be quantified to assess both the 
duration of AM0010 mediated immune activation and whether there is an AM0010 serum immune 
signature that correlates with PR/CR anti -tumor responses ; and iii)Peripheral blood T-cell receptor 
(TCR ) βsequences and PBMC and mRNA may be obtained from on -treatment serial blood draws .
2.2.3 Number of Study Sites
This study will be conducted at approximately 150sites in North Amer ica, Europe , and Asia-Pacific .
2.2.4 Number of Patients
The study will randomize approximately 566patients.
2.2.5 Study Completion Definition
This study will be considered complete (ie, the scientific evaluation will be complete) once it has 
been determined by Lilly that the evaluation of primary and secondary objectives issufficient and 
complete . Investigators will continue to follow the study schedule for all patients until notified by 
Lilly that study completion has occurred. After study completion, the patients who are on treatment

Confidentialand continuing to receive clinical benefit may contin ue receiving study drugs during the 
continued -access period .
2.2.6 Continued -Access Period
All patients remaining on study treatment without disease progression following study completion 
will enter the continued -access period of the study.  The continued -access period begins after study 
completion and ends at the end of trial.  During the continued- access period, patients on study 
treatment who continue to experience clinical benefit may continue to receive study treatment until 
disease progression, death, unacceptable toxicity, or end of trial.  Patients who are in the 30-day 
follow –up, but have not yet completed the visit will complete the necessary follow -up visit when the 
continued -access period begins and then discontinue the study.  If it is deemed to be in the best 
interest of the patient to start a new anti -cancer treatment prior to a scheduled follow -up visit, the 
follow -up visit duration may be shortened. In this case, the follow -up assessments should be 
completed prior to the initiation of the new therapy.
Lilly will notify investigators when the continued -access period begins. 
During the continued
-access period, all relevant assessments will be done according to Appendix B
and recorded on the case report form (CRF). 
Serious adverse event s (SAEs)will also be reported to Lilly Global Patient Safety and collected in the 
pharmacovigilance system.  In the event that an SAE occurs, additional information (such as local 
laboratory results, concomitant medications, and hospitalizations) may be requested by Lilly in order 
to evaluate the reported SAE. 
Investigators may perform other standard procedures and tests needed to treat and evaluate patients; 
howeve r, Lilly will not routinely collect the results of these assessments.

criteria .  Complete drug accountability records must be maintained .  All records and undispensed 
supplies of the investigational product must be availab le for inspection during every monitoring visit 
for the conduct of AM0010 investigational product accountability and inventory .  Please see the 
Pharmacy Manual for complete details .
5.1 Treat ment Administration
5.1.1 AM0010
AM0010 is provided as a sterile, clear sol ution formulated at a concentration of 2mg/mLand 4 
mg/mL. 
The AM0010 drug product is stored at the pharmacy at 2ºCto 8ºC.  Patients will store their AM0010 
in their refrigerator (2ºCto 8ºC).
While r eceiving FOLFOX during Cycles 1 –12, AM0010 5 µg/kg will be administered as 1 of 2 fixed 
doses , 
either 0.4 mg for patients weighing ≤80 kg or 0.8 mg for patients weighing >80kg.
AM0010 will be administered as a fixed dose, bracketed in 2 weight groups .  Ongoing PK analysis 
has shown that the apparent clearance is proportional to weight supporting a weight -based dosing .
The rational efor dosing at a flat rate with a cutoff at 80kg is based on safety and on the 
PK/P harmacodynamic relationship .  More specifically, imm une activation with AM0010 requires a 
serum trough of at least 1 ng/mL.  This trough level is reached with actual doses of 2.5 μg/kg and 
higher .  The MTD of AM0010 is 20 μg/kg. Following the brackete dfixed dosing regimen, all 
patients will receive betwee n 5 and 10 µg/kg AM0010 . This dose range correlated with a survival 
benef itin a Phase 1b study with AM0010 + FOLFOX in PDAC patients.
The effects of overdose with AM0010 and an antidote to overdose with AM0010 are unknown.
Non-huma n primates have been exposed to 5 -10 times the expected serum concentration in humans 
without acute adverse reactions.
For any subject experiencing AM0010 overdose, observation for any symptomatic side effects should 
be instituted and vital signs and biochemical and hematologi c parameters should be followed closely 
AM0010
Clinical Protocol AM0010 –301 (Sequoia) Amendment 3.0 Page 58of 141
Confidential(consistent with the protocol or more frequently, as needed). Appropriate supportive management to 
mitigate adverse effects should be initiated.
After discon tinuation of FO LFOX (ie, completion of the planned 12 cycl es or unacceptable 
FOLFOX -related toxicity) , the AM0010 dose at the 10-µ g/kg dose level will be administered as 1 of 
2 fixed doses ( ie,either 0.8 m g in 0.2mLfor body weight ≤80kgor 1.6 mg in 0.4 m Lfor body 
weight > 80 kg ),based on the patient’s weigh t during the course of the study .
In 144 patients who received AM0010 monotherapy, the MTD was determined at 20 µg/kg (Naing et 
al., 2016) .  Pharmacodynamic analysis indicates immune activation at 10µg/kg in a monotherapy 
setting.
Patients will be trained to self -administer AM0010 and will self -administer the dose throughout the 
study , starting with the first dose .  The Investigator or a qualified designee must be present during 
administration of the first dose .  A Dosing D iary must be kept by the patient with date and time of 
administration for dosing compliance monitoring. The diary will be a part of the source 
documentation and should be reviewed with the patient at every visit. Note that if the patient is 
unable or unwilling to self -administer the SQ injection of AM0010, the dose may be given by a 
caregiver.
5.1.2 FOLFOX Administration
FOLFOX treatment will be continued for up to 12 cycles or until disease progression or unacceptable 
chemotherapy -related toxicity .  The FOLFOX dosing regimen will consist of dl-LV 400 mg/m2and 
oxaliplatin 85 mg/m2followed by bolus 5- FU 400 mg/m2and a 46 -to 48 -hour infusion of 5 -FU 
2400 mg/m2.Note: if the institution is using l-LV(non-racemic) ,the dose is 200 mg/m2.
Prior to and during the treatment with either oxaliplatin or 5-FU at the beginning of each treatment 
cycle, premedication may be given per institution standard for the prophylaxis of nausea, vomiting, 
and diarrhea or following the g uidelines below.
A 5-hydroxytryptamine -3 (5-HT3) antagonist ( eg,ondansetron or granisetron) and dexamethasone 
may be administered for the prophylaxis of nausea and vomiting .  Dexa methasone (10 to 20 mg) may 
be administered as an IV b
olus administered over 30 to 60 seconds.
For preparation and complete prescribing information, refer to the most current prescribing 
information in the region .  Immune and chemotherapy regimens should be applied following the 
AM0010
Clinical Protocol AM0010 –301 (Sequoia) Amendment 3.0 Page 59of 141
Confidentialguidelines in the protocol or established institutio nal practices .Investigators or designees will review 
the patient’s hematology and chemistry panels, liver function tests, and the incidence of hematologic 
and non -hematologic toxicities prior toand during chemotherapy regimens.
5.1.3 Dosing Schedule
Patients will be treated on an outpatient basis with AM0010 plus FOLFOX or FOLFOX alone .  Each 
cycle is 14 days.
ARM 1: AM0010 plus FOLFOX
AM0010 dose should be administered on Days 1 –5 and Days 8–12 in the morning ,ideally with 24 
hours (±2 h ours) between doses .  Days 6, 7, 13, and 14 will be rest days .  
FOLFOX dosing should be 
initiat edon Day 1 of each cycle, after AM0010 administration on investigational ARM 1 (Figure 7).  
ARM 2 consists of FOLFOX administration alone as shown below, initiated on Day 1 of a 14-day
cycle ( Figure 8).
For patients in the combination therapy (AM0010 + FOLFOX) arm, after the last scheduled 
chemotherapy cycle in the absence of tumor progression , up to 12 cycles ,or chemotherapy 
intolerance, maintenance dosing of AM0010 may continue 5 days on and 2 days off at 10 μg/kg SQ
qd (see Section 5.1.1 ).
Crossover of patients from the FOLFOX -only treatment arm into the FOLFOX plus AM0010 
treatment arm is not permitted .  
Supportive care per the institution’s normal standard of care, 
including concomitant medications, can be provided at the Investigator’s discretion .
The documentation of the inv estigational product administration will be noted on the CRF page and 
in the source documentation .  The date, dose volume, and time of administration for each dose will be 
recorded in the patient diary and on the respective CRF page .  Details of preparing and administering 
AM0010 will be provided to the patient and are included in the Pharmacy Manual.

Confidential5.2 Dose Interruption, Reduction ,and Dose Schedule Modifications
If anon-hematologic AEis attributed to only 1 drug ( ie, AM0010, oxaliplatin ,or 5-FU), the
Investigator should determine if the drug will be continued based on the Investigator’s assessment of 
risk-benefit per the guideli nes outlined below .  For example, neuropathy, is clearly related to 
oxaliplatin ; therefore, 5-FU/ LVas well as A M0010 would not be responsible for this AE .
Hematologic Toxicity Dose Schedule Adjustment Requirements (graded according to the 
National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE )
v4.03
, Appendix G;see also Table 10):
Thrombocytopenia Grade s
3-4 with platelet count <50,000/mm3:delay treatment with AM0010 
and FOLFOX until platelet count returns to ≥100,000/mm3.  Re-introduction of AM0010 should 
be admin istered at 80% and FOLFOX at dose level −1.  If on a subsequent cycle these toxicities 
recur, AM0010 is reintroduced at60%
(−2dose level) and FOLFOX atdose level −2 after the 
first recurrence .  This will be accomplished by altering the dose schedule fro m 5 days on and 2 
days off to4days on and 3 days off(80%), and 3 days on 4 days off (60%) ,respectively .
Anemia Grade s
3–4 with Hgb<8g/dL:delay treatment with AM0010 and FOLFOX until Hgb 
returns to ≥10g/dL.  Re-introduction of AM0010 should occur at 80% and FOLFOX at dose 
level −1

FOLFOX until ANC returns to >1,000/mm3.  Re-introduction of FOLFOX should occur at dose 
level −1.  If on a subsequent cycle these toxicities recur, FOLFOX is reduced to dose level −2 
after the first recurrence .  AM0010 dosing will continue without interrup tion.
Non-Hematologic Toxicity Dose Schedule Adjustment Requirements (graded according to the 
NCI CTCAE v4.03,Appendix G):
≥Grade 3 fatigue, elevations in AST, ALT, al kaline phosphatase ,or bilirubin require dose 
interruption and delay in subsequent therapy until recovered to ≤Grade 1 or pre -therapy baseline .  
Re-introduction of all agents at the previous dose level .
≥Grade 3 GI AEs such as diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and bloating 
require a delay in subsequent therapy unti l recovered to ≤Grade 1 or pre -therapy baseline .  
Re-introduction: Reduce offending agent by 1 dose level .  Keep other agents unchanged.
Other non -hematologic toxicities with an impact on organ function of ≥Grade 3 require dose 
reduction .  
Hold treatment for the offending agent (or all agents ,seeTable 11), delay in 
subsequent therapy until recovered to ≤Grade 1 or pre -therapy baseline .  Re-introduction: 
Reduce offending agent by 1dose level .  Keep other agents unchanged.
If AM0010 is suspected to be one of the offending agent s, reintroduction will be at the original 
dose after the first occurrence .  If on a subsequent cycle these toxicities recur, the AM0010 
treatment schedule will be decreased to 80% .  Upon second recurrence of Grade 3or 4 AE, the 
AM0010 dose will be decreased to 6 0%.  This will be accomplished by a ltering the dose schedule 
from 5 days on and 2 days off to4days on and 3 days off (80%) ,and 3 days on 4 days off (60%) ,
respectively.  See below. 
It is common for oxaliplatin to cause Grade 3 or 4 neuropathy by 4months of therapy .  On both 
treatment arms f ollowing the dose modification inTable 11 for neuropathy, if oxaliplatin needs to 
be discontinued, continue therapy with 5-FU/LV.

Tumor assessment of all sites of disease following RECIST v.1.1 (Appendix C): Spiral CT orMRI, if 
allergic to contrast .  The same radiographic procedure used to define measurable lesions must be used 
throughout the study for each patient .  The RECIST v.1.1 guideline recommends spiral CT images for 
chest, abdomen, and pelvis should be performed. Assessment should be obtained 8 weeks (±3 days)
after Randomization and every 8 weeks (±3 days) regardless of cycle number and regardless of any

after EOT .  If the patient starts new anti -cancer therapy within 30 days of the last dose of study
medication, the Follow -up visit should be performed prior to the start of new anti -cancer therapy ,
within the 30 -day window .  The following procedures and asse ssments will be performed on the day 
of the Follow -up visit for all patients, including early termination:

Note: In the event the clinical site business hours, weekends, or holiday schedule lead to missed 
ADA time points, these time points will not need to be made up on a different day.
6.6.1 Patient Follow -Up –for Tumor Assessment of Response
Patients who are discontinued from study treatments in the absence of disease progressio n 
(eg,patients removed for unacceptable toxicity) will undergo repeat imaging and tumor response 
assessments every 8 weeks (±3 days), regardless of cycle number or dose interruptions , until disease 
progr ession is documented .  It is recommended that subseq uent therapy not be instituted until disease 
progr ession is documented .  If any of the components or the combination are continued, this should 
be considered as continuation of the study treatment regimen and imaging should continue .  If a 
patient starts a new anti -cancer therapy prior to disease progression, then repeat imaging and tumor 
response assessments should be discontinued .
6.6.2 Patient Long -Term  Follow -Up –for Survival
Post study , patients will be contacted via phone call to determine long -term surviv al status and record 
of any other anti -cancer therapy and cancer -related surgery every 8weeks for 12 mont hs, then every 
12weeks thereafter until death, the study closes, or 3 years have elapsed since patient discontinuation

with the patient’s treating physician.
Patients who are not deceased by the time Lilly has m ade the determination the study will be ended 
will receive a final follow -up phone call to assess survival status and communicate the Sponsor’s 
decision.
The Investigator will make every effort to contact the patient or a close relative or caretaker by phone 
to collect survival informat ion.  The Investigator should show due diligence by documenting in the 
source documents steps taken to contact the patient ( ie, dates of phone calls, registered letters, etc.).

days to confirm the abnormality and to det ermine if it is increasing or decreasing.  If the abnormality 
persists or worsens, clinical and laboratory monitoring should be initiated by the investigator, based 
on the hepatic monitoring tests ( Appendix I) and in consultation with the Lilly Clinical Research 
Physician ( CRP ).  Monitoring of ALT, AST, and total bilirubin should continue until levels normalize 
or return to approximate baseline levels.
Lilly will periodic ally review evolving aggregate safety data within the study by appropriate methods.
Pregnancy Test 6.7.6.1
All females of childbearing potential will have a serum pregnancy test at Screening .  Urine pregnancy 
tests will be performed on Day 1 of each odd-numbered cycle , ever y 28 days in patients who continue 
AM0010 monotherapy after FOLFOX discontinuation, at EOT, and 30 days after EOT .  The results 
must be confirmed as negative prior to administration of investigational product.
Health Outcomes 6.7.6.2
The assessment of p atient -reported outcome s (PRO s), including symptoms, functioning, and health 
status, will be assessed using the EORTC QLQ -C30 questionnaire (Version 3) and EQ -5D-5L. Both 
instruments should be ad ministered together at th e beginning of the study visit prio r to any extensive 
contact or consult ation with study site personnel, which may bias patient responses. The EORTC 
QLQ -C30 will be presented first, followed by EQ -5D-5L. Patients will only complete either 
instrument if a validated translation is made avai lable in a language in which the patient is fluent. 
The EORTC QLQ -C30 is aself-administered questionnaire that asses ses multiple dimensions of 
HRQoL of cancer patients participating in international clinical trials. The EORTC QLQ- C30 
includes 5 function al dom ains (physical, role, emotional, cognitive, and social ), 9symptom scales 
(fatigue, nausea and vomiting, pain, dyspnea, insomnia, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea, and 
financial difficulties ), and global health status /QoL .
The EQ- 5D-5L (Rabin et al., 2011) is a PRO measure designed to assess current health status for 
clinical and economic appraisal. Patients are asked to rate 5dimensions of HRQOL -Mobility, Self -
care, Usual activities, Pain/discomfort, and Anxiety/dep ression -using 5order ed response categories:

problems (5) .
The questionnaires will be completed by all patients as detailed in the SOE ( Appendix A ). 
6.8 Sample Collection
6.8.1 Collect ion of Archival Tumor Tissue
Collection of archiv altumor material is neither mandatory nor required for eligibility.  However, 
attempts should be to acquire these archival tissue samples, if available ,starting after the patient is 
enrolled. Patients will be asked to consent to the access of pre -existing samples (slides or blocks) 
(frozen and/or paraffin -embedded tumor samples )for biomarker development . Pathology reports 
should be obtained if available.  Immunohistochemical staining of these tumor samples may be 
conducted to assess the degree of immune cell infiltration and expression of immune cell surface 
molecules and cytokines within the tumor .  Refer to theLaboratory Manual for additional 
information.   These materials will not be used fo r any other purpose at the end of the study.  Fresh 
tumor biopsies are not required, but should replace archival tissue if it is not available.
No fresh tumor biopsies are required f or participation in the study.
6.8.2 Pharmacokinetic Sample Collection 
Lilly will attempt to collect PK samples in patients randomized to ARM 1 and ADA samples from 
ARM 1 and 2 patients at clinical sites.  Patients must give their permission to obtain the additional
blood samples as outlined in the ICF .  Within each 14 -day cycle (w ith the first day of dosing 
designated as Day 1) .
Blood samples will be obtained as shown in Table 15:
Cycles 1 and 2, Days 1 and 13
Cycle 3 Day 1 Only
Cycle 4 Day 13 Only 
Cycle 5 Day 1 Only
EOT and follow -up visit 30 days after EOT (ADA only) .
In the event of clinical site business hours, w eekends ,or holiday schedule leadingtomissed PK/ADA
time points , these time points will not need to be made up on a different day. Patients will be 
instructed to administer AM0010 in the usual manner at hom e on days of PK sampling .  Thetime at

6.8.3 Carbohydrate CA 19 -9
Serum levels of CA 19- 9 will be evaluated over time to assess changes after treatment with AM0010 
plus FOLFOX and FOLFOX alone .  Since CA 19 -9 is being used only in an exploratory evaluation to 
deter mine whether there is a correlation with efficacy outcomes, increases in CA 19 -9 levels in this 
study should not be used as evidence for progressive disease or for discontinuing patients from study
treatment s.

Confidential6.8.4 Exploratory Biomarker s
Potential relationships between biomarker data andefficacy outcomes may be evaluated .
These exploratory predictive biomarker analyses will be conducted on biomarkers measured in
blood and intumor samples.  Pre -treatment biomarkers mayfocus on immunological proteins 
expressed in archival tumor samples associated with AM0010 mechanism of action ,and CD8+ T -cell 
secretion of IFNγ in response to AM0010 treatment .  These data will be used to determine whether 
there are predictive biomarker signatures that correlate with subsequent objective tumor responses.
Treatment associated serum biomarkers may also be measured .  The treatment -associated magnitude 
of changes in serum IL -18, IFN γ, IL-4, TGFβand CA 19 -9may be quantified .  In addition, the 
mRNA/DNA from whole blood samples may be analyzed for TCR βsequences and the expression of 
immune regulatory molecules .  These data may be used to determine the peripheral blood immune 
activation signature of AM0010 treatment that correlates with PR/CR /SDresponses and rate of CA 
19-9 decline .

Confidential7.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS
7.1 Study Objectives
This is an open -label, mu lti-center, randomized, Phase 3 study designed to compare the efficacy and 
safety of AM0010 in combination with FOLFOX versus FOLFOX alone in patients with metastatic 
adenocarcinoma of the pancreas who have progressed on 1prior gemcitabine -containing regi men.
7.2 Determination of Sample Size
The sample size is calculated in order to compare the OSbetween patients randomized to receive 
AM0010 in combination with FOLFOX versus FOLFOX alone.
Approximately 566 patients will be randomized to the 2arms in a 1:1 ratio to observe at least 393 
death events .  Assuming a median OS time for th e FOLFOX arm of 5.9 months, 393 events are 
needed to detect a 35% increase with 85% p ower using a log -rank test ( 2-sided) with an overall type 1 
error of 0.05, which corres ponds t o a median survival of 8 months in the AM0010 in combination 
with FOLFOX arm (HR=0.7375) .

Confidential7.3 Analysis Populations
Intent -to-treat population: All patients who are randomiz ed, with study drug regimen assignment 
designated to initial Randomization, regardless of whether patients receive any study drug(s) or 
receive a different drug(s) from that to which they were randomized .  This is the primary dataset 
for analyses of efficacy and baseline disease characteristics .
Safety Population: All patients who receive any amount of study drug(s) with study drug 
assignment designated according to actual study drug(s) received .  This is t he primary dataset for 
treatment administration/compliance and safety.
Per-Protocol Population: All patients who are in the Safety population and have no major 
protocol deviations .
7.4 Study Endpoints
The primary objective of Phase 3 is to evaluate OScomparing 2treatment arms .  The primary 
endpoint is OS.  Thekey secondary endpoints are PFS, ORR , DoR, DCR, 1 year -OS rate, and safety .
7.4.1 Efficacy Endpoints
Primary Endpoint 7.4.1.1
Overall Survival is defined as the time from the date of Randomization to the date of death .  Patients 
who are no longer on study treatments should be followed for survival .  Apatient who is alive will be 
censor ed at the date last known to be alive.
Secondary Endpoints 7.4.1.2
7.4.1.2.1 Progression -Free Survival
Progression -free survival is defined as the time from Randomization to the date of the initial 
documented objective tumor progression thatis confir med by subsequent radiotherapy as determined 
by the Investigator (per RECIST v.1.1 criteria) or death due to any cause ,whichever occurs first . If 
no subsequent scan is available, the initial progression will be used as the objective PD date. If the 
subsequent scan does not confirm the initial progression, the patient will continue to be followed up 
for future scan s. Patients who experience clinical disease progression should undergo scanning to 
document radiographic disease progression per RECIST v.1.1 .  Patients who die without a reported 
AM0010
Clinical Protocol AM0010 –301 (Sequoia) Amendment 3.0 Page 88of 141
Confidentialprior progression will be considered to have progressed on the date of their death .  Patients who did 
not p rogress or die will be censored on the date of their last tumor assessment.  Patients who did not 
have any post-baseline tumor assessment and did not die will be censored on the date they were 
randomized with a duration of 1 day .  Patients who received any subsequent anti -cancer therapy 
without a prior documented disease progr ession event will be censored at the last tumor assessment 
prior to initiation of the subsequent anti -cancer therapy. Patients who have documented disease 
progr ession or death after m issing ≥2 consecutive postbaseline tumor assessments will be censored to 
the last adequate tumor assessment before the missed assessments or date of randomization, 
whichever is later.
7.4.1.2.2 Objective Response Rate
Objective response rate is defined as the proportion of patients with a confirmed CR or confirmed PR 
relative to the total analysis population .  Best overall response is defined as the best response as 
deter mined by the Investigator, recorded between the date of Randomization and the date of 
objec tively documented progression per RECIST v.1.1 or the date of subsequent therapy, whichever 
occurs first .  For patients without documented progression or subsequent anti -cancer therapy, all 
available response assessments will contribute to the BOR determin ation .Complete or partial 
responses may be claimed only if the criteria for each are met at a subsequent time point as specified 
in the protocol ( approximately 4 weeks later). For patients who continue AM0010 in combination 
with FOLFOX treatment beyond progr ession due to suspected “pseudoprogression ,”the BOR should 
be deter mined based on response assessment recorded at the next scheduled CT scan ,which is done 
approximately 4weeks after pseudoprogression to assess BOR .  If the patient subsequently responds 
or returns to baseline, that assessment of objective tumor response is achieved after 
pseudoprogression as the response   Designation of best response of SD requires the criteria to be met 
at least 8 weeks (±3 days) after Randomization.
7.4.1.2.3 Disease Control Rate
The DCR isdefined as the proportion of pat ients who achieve confirmed CRs ,PRs,and SD .
7.4.1.2.4 Duration of Response
Duration of response is defined as the time from the date of the first documentation of objective 
tumor res ponse (CR or PR), as determined by the Investigator using RECIST v.1.1, that is

The 1 -year OSrate is estimated using the Kaplan -Meier method.
7.4.2 Safety
Safety will be evaluated by the incidence of TEAEs and SAEs, physical examination, ECOG PS, vital 
signs, ECG , and laboratory abnormalities during study drug(s)dosing .  Toxicities will be graded 
using the NCI CTCAE v4.03.

ConfidentialPrimary Endpoint –Overall Survival 7.5.4.1
Overall survival will be compared in 2randomized treat ment arms using a 2-sided log -rank test, 
stratified by Interactive voice response system (IVRS)prior gemcitabine -containing regimen 
(gemcitabine or gemcitabine /nab-paclitaxel) and North America versus Europe versus APAC .
Thefirst interim analysis will be performed when approximately 60 randomized patients have had the 
opportunity to complete 4months of therapy from the date of Randomization .  The nom inal 
significance will be calculated based on O’Brien and Fleming (Lan -Demets) alpha spending function 
in EAST v6.4 .  Thesecond interim analysis is planned after approximately 276deaths (70% of the 
393 events) have been observed .  The stopping boundaries will be derived based on the actual 
observed death sat the second interim analys es.  If the second interim analysis is performed 
approximately at 276 deaths , the study could be stopped by the DMC f or efficacy if the p -value is 
≤0.015 .  The nominal significance level for the final look of OS after 393 events would then be 0. 045.
The null (H o) and alternative (H a) hypotheses for testing OSare:
Ho:  HR AM0010 plus FOLFOX/FOLFOX alone = 1
Ha:  HR AM0010 plus FOLFOX/FOLFOX alone ≠ 1 
The Kaplan -Meier curve for survival will be presented for each treatment arm and the difference in 
the curves will be tested using the stratified log -rank test. Patient median survival time (including 
95% confidence interval [CI]) for each treatment arm w ill be estimated using the Kaplan -Meier 
method. In addition, theKaplan -Meier method will be used to estimate OS rates at fixed time points 
for each treatment group. These rates will be compared based on a normal approximation for the 
differ ence between the rates.
A stratified Cox proportional hazard model (Cox 1972 )with treatment as a factor will be used to 
estimate the HR and corresponding 95% CI. An additional unstratified Cox regression model will be 
employed to explore the effects of prognostic var iables, such as of the stratification variables and 
intrinsic/extrinsic factors, on treatment response.

Confidential8.0 EFFICACY
8.1 Clinical Response Assessm ents
Patients will be evaluated by CT scan with contrast or MRI (if allergic to contrast )at Screening
within 28 days of Randomization ,at Week 8 (±3 days), and every 8 weeks (±3days)thereafter ,
regardless of cycle number and regardless of any dose interruptions .  The same radiographic 
procedure used to define measurable lesions and non -measurable lesions must be used throughout the 
study for each patient .  Response will be evaluated using RECIST v.1.1.
Patients who have not had progression of their cancer should undergo repeat imaging and tumor 
response assessments until radiographic disease progression is documented .  In addition, patients 
randomized to either treatment arm who are discontinued from study treatment (AM0010, 1or all 
components of FOLFOX) in the absence of disease progression ( eg,patients with AE or intolerance) 
should undergo repeat imaging and tumor response assessments until radiographic disease 
progr ession is documented .  Any patient with symptoms suggestive of clinical disease progression 
should be evaluated by radiographic scan at the time the symptoms occur.
Objective responses (CR or PR) will be confirmed no less than 4 weeks after the criteria for the 
response are first m etfollowing RECIST v.1.1 (Appendix C).
If a patient starts a new anti -cancer therapy prior to disease progression, then repeat imaging and 
tumor response assessments should be discontinued .  The PFS will be censored at the last tumor 
assessment prior to initiation of antitumor treatment .
8.1.1 Pseudoprogression and Confirmation of Disease Progression
Accumulating evidence indicates a minority of patients treated with immunotherapy may derive 
clinical benefit despite initial evidence of PD .  Patients treated with FOLFOX alone will not be 
permitted to continue their treatment beyond initial RECIST v1.1 defined PD.
AM0010
Clinical Protocol AM0010 –301 (Sequoia) Amendment 3.0 Page 97of 141
ConfidentialPatients treated with AM0010 during the maintenance cycles in Ar m 1 will be permitted to continue 
treatment beyond initial RECIST v1.1 defined PD if they meet the following criteria:
1.Investigator -assessed clinical benefit, and do not have rapid disease progression
2.Continue to meet all other study protocol eligibility criteria
3.Tolerance of study drug
4.Stable ECOG PS
5.Treatment beyond progr ession will not delay an imminent intervention to prevent serious 
complications of disease progression ( eg,CNS metastases)
A radiographic assessment/scan should be performed 4weeks (±3 days) after original PD to 
deter mine whether there has been a de crease in tumor size, or continued PD .  The assessment of 
clinical benefit should be balanced by clinical judgment as to whether the patients is clinically 
deteriorating and unlikely to receive any benefit from continued treatment with AM0010 .  A 
confirmat ory scan will be required in the case of clinical deterioration suspected to be disease 
progr ession .  
If the Investigator feels that the patient is deriving clinical benefit with continued treatment, the 
patients should remain on the trialand be monitore d according to the SOE ( Appendix A ).  The 
decision to continue treatment should be discussed with the Lilly Medical Monitor and documented in 
the study records.
For patients who continue AM0010 beyond initial progression, further progression is defined as an 
additional 10% increase in tumor burden volume from the time of initial PD .  This includes an 
increase in the sum of all target lesions and/or the development of new measurable lesions .  When 
assessing disease progression, the Investigator should use a new baseline tumor burden that includes 
new lesions that developed at the time of initial progression. Patients will discontinue study treatment 
upon confirmed PD (4 weeks after initial PD).
New lesions are considered measurable at the time of initial progression if the longest diameter is at 
least 10 mm (except for pathological lymph nodes ,which must have a short axis of at least 15 mm) .  
Global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of study treatments without objective 
evidence of disease progression at that time should be reported as “ clinical p rogression .”  Every effort

8.2 Central Imaging Independent Review 
All on -study spiral CT/MRI scans for all patients enrolled in the study will be collected prospectively 
and submitted to a central imaging reader for archiving and storage and may be reviewed at the end of 
study at the request of Lilly .  A central imaging reviewer blinded to treatment assignment will provide 
an indep endent review of tumor response and tumor progression for patients enrolled in the Phase 3.

Confidential9.0 ADVERSE EVENTS
9.1 Definition of Adverse Events
9.1.1 Adverse Events
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject 
administered a pharmaceutical product that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this 
treatment.  An AEcan therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (incl uding an abnormal 
laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal 
(investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product..  
Investigators are responsible for:
monitoring the safety of patients in this study and for alerting Lilly or its designee to 
any event that seems unusual, even if this event may be considered an unanticipated 
benefit to the patient ,
the appropriate medical care of patients during the study ,
documenting their review of each laboratory safety report , and
following, through an appropriate healthcare option, AEs that are serious or 
otherwise medically important, considered related to study treatment or the study, or 
that caused the patient to discontinue study treatment before completing the study.  
The patient should be followed until the event resolves, stabilizes with appropriate 
diagnostic evaluation, or is reasonably explained.  Frequency of follow -up evaluation 
is left to the discretion of the investigato r.
Adverse event terms should be recorded concisely, using acceptable medical terms. When possible, a 
diagnosis ( ie, disease or syndrome) rather than the component signs and symptoms should be 
recorded on the AE CRF ( eg, congestive heart failure rather th an dyspnea, rales, and cyanosis). 
However, signs and symptoms considered unrelated to syndromes or diseases are to be recorded as 
individual AEs on the CRF ( eg, if congestive heart failure and severe headache are observed at the 
same time, each event is to be recorded as an individual AE).Only abnor mal laboratory values that 
result in clinical sequelae or require medication for treatment should be recorded as an AE. The AE
should not be recorded as a procedure or clinical measurement ( ie, a laboratory or vital sign). The 
underlying reason for the procedure or the abnormal clinical measurements, and, whenever possible, a 
diagnosis, should be recorded. The diagnosis should be recorded; not the individual lab oratory test 
name.
AM0010
Clinical Protocol AM0010 –301 (Sequoia) Amendment 3.0 Page 100of 141
ConfidentialA pre -existin g condition is one that is present at the start of the study and is reported as part of the 
patient’s medical history .  It should be reported as an AE if the frequency, intensity ,or character of 
the condition worsens during study treatment . 
"Death" as anoutcome of an AE may occur and should not be reported as an AE ,but the cause of 
death should be reported on the AEeCRF .  
For the purpose of this study, progression of underlying malignancy is not considered an (S)AE. 
Hospitalization, prolonged hospita lization, or death due solely to the progression of underlying 
malignancy will be captured on the AE CRF, but may NOT be reported as an SAE. Clinical 
symptoms of progression may be reported as AEs if they cannot be determined to be exclusively due 
to the progression, or if they do not fit the expected pattern of progression for metastatic pancreatic 
cancer.
If there is any uncertainty about an AEbeing due to the progression of cancer, it should be reported as 
an (S)AE.
Lack of drug effect is not an AE in clinical studies because the purpose of the clinical study is to 
establish treatment effect.
Planned surgeries and nonsurgical interventions should not be reported as AEs unless the underlying 
medical condition has worsened during the course of the study.
9.1.2 Serious Adverse Events
An SAE is any AE from this study that results in 1of the following outcomes:
death
initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization
a life -threatening experience ( ie, immediate risk of dying)
persistent or significant disability/incapacity
congenital anomaly/birth defect
important medical events that may not be immediately life -threatening or result in 
death or require hospitalization may be considered serious when, based upon 
appropriate medical judgment, they may jeop ardize the patient and may require 
intervention to prevent 1of the other outcomes listed in the definition above.
AM0010
Clinical Protocol AM0010 –301 (Sequoia) Amendment 3.0 Page 101of 141
ConfidentialFor the purposes of this trial, the following will NOT be considered SAEs:
Hospitalizations <24 hours, or for planned surgeries or procedure s.
Progression of underlying malignancy as a stand -alone event term; clinical events associated 
with disease progression should be reported as AEs or SAEs as applicable.
Serious AEs, including death, caused by disease progression should not be reported unless the 
investigator deems them to be possibly related to study treatment. 
9.1.3 Unexpected Adverse Events
Unexpected AEs are defined as any AE, the nature, specificity ,or sever ity of which is inconsistent 
with the Referenced Safety Information within the Guid ance to Investigator section of the Clinical IB
for AM0010 and the package inserts for the individual drugs that comprise FOLFOX .
9.1.4 Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction (SUSAR) Definition
A suspected, unexpected, serious, adverse reaction (SUSAR) is any AE for which there is evidence to 
suggest a causal relationship between the study drug(s) and the AE and which is assessed as both 
unexpected and serious. An unexpected adverse reaction, ie, any untoward and unintended response 
to the study drug(s) , is one for which the nature and severity is inconsistent with the applicable 
reference safety information ( eg, IBor package insert of the approved drugs in the combination ). 
Lilly has procedures that will be followed for the recording and expedited repor ting of SUSARs that 
are consistent with global regulations and associated detailed guidances.
9.2 Grading of Adverse Events
If the NCI CTCAE v4.03cannot be applied, the AEseverity should be graded on the following scale:
1 = Mild: Usually transient; requires no special treatment and does not interfere with the 
patient’s daily activities
2 = Moderate: Produces a low level of inconvenience to the patient and may interfere 
with daily activities .  These events are usually ameliorated by simple therapeutic 
measures
3 = Sever e: Interrupts daily activity and requires systemic drug therapy or other medical 
treatment .
AM0010
Clinical Protocol AM0010 –301 (Sequoia) Amendment 3.0 Page 102of 141
Confidential4 = Life-Threatening: Places the patient, in the view of the Investigator, at immediate 
risk of death from the reaction as it occurred, ie, it does not include a reaction that, 
had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death .
5 = Death: Refers to death related to an AE .  The AE resulted in the patient’s death.
9.3 Relationship t oAM0010 and/or FOLFOX
The investigator will interpret and document whether or not an AE has a reasonable possibility of 
being related to study treatment or a study procedure, taking into ac count the disease, concomitant 
treatments, or pathologies.  A “reasonable possibility” means that there is a cause -and-effect 
relationship between the study treatment and/or study procedure and the AE. The Investigator or 
qualified Sub-I nvestigator is res ponsible for assessing the relationship to AM0010 and FOLFOX 
using clinical judgment and the following considerations:
No: Evidence exists that the AEhas an etiology other than the study drug(s).  For SAEs, an 
alternative causality must be provided ( eg, pre-existing condition, underlying disease, intercurrent 
illness, or concomitant medication).
Yes: There is reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by the investigational 
medicinal product.
9.4 Reporting of Adverse Events
After the ICF is s igned, study site personnel will record via eCRF the occurrence and nature of each 
patient’s preexisting conditions, including clinically significant signs and symptoms of the disease 
under treatment in the study.  In addition, study site personnel will re cord via eCRF any change in the 
preexisting conditions and any new conditions as AEs.  Investigators should record their assessment 
of the potential relatedness of each AE to study treatment via eCRF.
At each visit assessment ,all AEs either observed by the Investigator or one of the Investigator's 
professional collaborators, or reported by the patient spontaneously, or in response to a direct 
question will be recorded o n the AEs eCRF , whether believed by the Investigator to be related or 
unrelated to the s tudy medication .  If any AE occurs after dosing with study medication, the patient 
should be followed with the appropriate treatment and close medical supervision .  The AEs that 
started after signing the ICF and up to 30 days after the last dose of study d rug(s) will be collected. 
The Investigator will record the AE on the CRF and will provide the date of onset, severity, 
AM0010
Clinical Protocol AM0010 –301 (Sequoia) Amendment 3.0 Page 103of 141
Confidentialrelationship to study medication, date of resolution (or the fact that it is still continuing), action taken, 
and outcome of the AE .  A causality assessment will be made to determine whether or not the AE is 
thought to be drug related .  Removal of a patient from the study because of AEs or changes in 
laboratory test values, whether by the Investigator or by the patient’s own volition, shou ld be reported 
to Lilly or designee promptly .Study site personnel must report any treatment discontinuations that 
result from AEs to Lilly or its designee via eCRF, clarifying, if possible, the circumstances leading to 
the discontinuation of treatment.
9.4.1 Reporting of Serious Adverse Events
After signing the ICF , all AEs are recorded by the site in the eCRF .TheSAE reporting to Lilly or 
designee begins after the patient has signed the ICF and has received study treatment.  However, if an 
SAE occurs after s igning the ICF, but prior to receiving study treatment, it needs to be reported 
ONLY if it is considered reasonably possibly related to the study procedure. 
If an ongoing SAE that is consider edrelated to study drug remains unresolved at the conclusion ofthe 
study treatment ,additional follow -up m ust continue until resolution or stabilization of the SAE.
If an SAE is present at the EOT visit, the SAE (and associated AEs and concomitant medications) 
should be followed to resolution or until the Investigator assesses the subject as stable, or the subject 
is lost to follow -up or withdraws consent. Resolution/stable means the subject has returne d to 
baseline state of health or the Investigator does not expect any further improvement or worsening of 
the event.
If study drug is discontinued because of an SAE, this information must be included in the SAE report.
Study site personnel must notify Lillyor its designee of any SAE within 24 hours of investigator 
awareness of the event via a Lilly -approved method.  If alerts are issued via telephone, they are to be 
immediately followed with official notification on study -specific SAE forms.  This 24- hour 
notification requirement refers to the initial SAE information and all follow -up SAE information.
Investigators are not obligated to actively seek AEs or SAEs in patients once they have discontinued 
and/or completed the study (the patient summary CRF has been completed).  However, if the 
investigator learns of any SAE, including a death, at any time after a patient has been discharged from 
the study, and he/she considers the event reasonably possibly related to the study treatment or study 
participation, th e investigator must promptly notify Lilly or the designee.

applicable local laws or regulations .  
9.4.2 Pregnancy
Females of Childbearing Potential 9.4.2.1
Pregnancy during maternal or paternal exposure to study treatment does not meet the definition of an 
AE,but should be reported.  However, to fulfill regulatory requirements any pregnancy should be 
reported following the SAE process to collect data on the outcome for both mother and fetus. 
Pregnancies (including a posit ive pregnancy test regardless of age or disease state) of a female patient 
occurring while the patient is on the study , or within 9 0 days of the patient’s last dose of study
treatments, are considered immediately reportable events .  The study treatments sh ould be 
discontinued immediately .  The pregnancy, suspected pregnancy, or positive pregnancy test must be 
reported to the Lilly or the Designee Drug Safety immediately by facsimile, or other appropriate 
method, using the Pregnancy Initial Report Form or ap proved equivalent form.
The Investigator will follow the female patient until completion of the pregnancy and must notify 
Lilly or the Designee Drug S afety immediately about the outcome of the pregnancy (either normal or 
abnor mal outcome) using the Pregnan cy Follow -up Report Form or approved equivalent form .  
If the outcome of the pregnancy was abnormal ( eg,spontaneous or therapeutic abortion), the 
Investigator should report the abnormal outcome as an AE .  If the abnormal outcome meets any of the 
serious criteria, it must be reported as an SAE to Lilly ortheDesignee Drug Safety by facsimile, or 
other appropriate method, within 24 hours of the Investigator’s knowledge of the event using the SAE 
Report Form or approved equivalent form.
All neonatal deaths that occur within 28 days of birth should be reported, without regard to causality,

Confidential12.3 Infor med Consent
Investigators must ensure that patient s are clearly and fully informed about the purpose, potential 
risks, and other critical issues regarding clinical trials in which they volunteer to participate.
Lilly or its designee will provide the Investigator with an appropriate ( ie,global or local ) sample ICF,
which will include all elements required by ICH, GCP ,and applicable regulatory requirements .  The 
sample ICFwill adhere to the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
Investigators must:
1.Provide a copy of the consent form and written information about the study in the language in 
which the patient is most proficient prior to clinical study participation .  The language must be 
non-technical and easily understood .
2.Allow time necessary for patient to inquire about the details of the study .
3.Obtain a signed and dated informed consent from the patient and the person who conducted 
the informed consent discussion .
4.Obtain the IRB/IEC’s written approval/favorable opin ion of the written ICFand any other 
information to be provided to the patient s prior to the beginning of the study and after any 
revisions are completed for new information.
5.Revise the informed consent whenever important new information becomes available that is 
relevant to the patient ’s consent .  The Investigator, or a person designated by the Investigator, 
should fully inform the patient of all pertinent aspects of the study and of any new information 
relevant to the patient ’s willingness to continue par ticipation in the study .  The communication 
should be documented .
The confidentiality of records that could identify the patient must be protected, respecting the privacy 
and confidentiality rules applicable to regulatory requirements, the patient ’s signed ICF and, in the 
US, the patient ’s signed Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act ( HIPAA )Authorization .
The consent form must also include a statement that Lilly and its designees and regulatory authorities 
have direct access to patient records .
The patient must also be informed about the nature of the study to the extent compatible with the 
patient ’s understanding, and should they become capable, personally sign and date the consent form 
as soon as possible .  The explicit wish of a patient unable to give his or her written consent who is

1 and 13,Cycle 3 Day 1 only, Cycle 4 Day  13 only, Cycle 5 Day  1 only.  ADA will also be collected at EOT and at follow -up visit 30 day s after EOT .  
Blood samples for biomarkers ( PDsamples) are collected pre -dose onC1D1, C1D13, C2D13, C4D13, and EOT for patients on both arms .  See Lab Manual
for further details .
kSafety lab tests are listed .  If Screening labs are done within 3 days prior, then Screening labs can be used as Day 1 labs.   Laborato ry tests performed as part 
of standard practice may be used for Screening if conducted within 21 days prior to Randomization.
lSerum pregnancy test performed at Screening; urine pregnancy test performed locally at all other time points by dipstick as a ppropriate for women of 
child-bearing age .  A urine sample for pregnancy testing for female patients will also be obtained at Day 1 of every odd-numbered cycle, every 28 days in 
patients who continue AM0010 monotherapy after FOLFOX discontinuation, EOT, and 30 days after EOT.
mCA 19 -9(±3 days) will be evaluated at Screening, on Day 1 of ever y oddcycle, ever y 28 day s after discontinua tion of FOLFOX, and at EOT.
nThe collection of archived tumor tissues is notmandatory or required for eligibility. Attempts should be made to acquire these tissues starting once the 
patient is enrolled in the study .  Pathology reports should be obtained.
oTumo r response will be assessed by the study site and by  an independent radiology reviewer .  The process for collection of CT images for purpose of central 
independent review is described in the Imagin ingManual .  Patients whose scans show radiographic pro gression in the absence of clinical deterioration 
including worsening ECOG PSas assessed by the Investigator may remain on AM0010 plus FOLFOX study treatments and have an unscheduled scan,
4weeks later as outlined in Section 8.1.1 .  If this subsequent scan shows disease progression, the patient will be discontinued from the study .  Patients on 
subsequent scan and response (CR, PR, and SD) will remain on study treatments .  Patients with CR or PR need to have a confirmatory scan ( ≥4 weeks).
EOT scan done if not done within 4 weeks prior.
pRandomization should occur within 21 days of starting baseline .  Patients must begin treatment within 3 days af ter the date of Randomization.
qPatients will be contacted via phone call to determine long -term survival status and record of any other anti -cancer therapy and cancer related surgery. The 
evaluation may be conducted by record review and/or telephone contact with the patient’s treating physician.
rStaff administered dose and training for AM0010 self -injection on Cycle 1, Day 1.  FOLFOX; Day 1 of each 14 -day cycle for 12 cycles: l-dl-LV 400 mg/m2
and oxaliplatin 85 mg/m2followed by bolus 5 -FU 400 mg/m2and a 46- to 48-hour infusion of 5 -FU 2400 mg/m2.
sTumo r evaluatio n by CT or MRI will be performed during Screening (within 4 weeks prior to Randomization), a t Week 8 (±3 days) and every 8 weeks 
(±3days) regardless of cycle number and regardless of any dose interruptions until PD by RECIST v.1.1 .  The same radiographic procedure used to define 
measurable or non -measurable lesions must be used througho ut the study for each patient. The RECIST v.1.1 guideline recommends spiral CT images for 
chest, abdomen, and pelvis should be performed .  Scans performed as part of standard practice may be used if conducted within 28 days prior to 
Randomization.

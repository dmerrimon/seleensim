TITLE:  An Investigator -Initiated Open -Label, Randomized Study of Gemcabene in Adults with 
Familial Partial Lipodystrophy Disease  (FPLD ) 
PROTOCOL NUMBER:  HUM00130803 / GEM -IIT-602 
INVESTIGATIONAL PRODUCT:  Gemcabene calcium tablets (gemcabene)  
PHASE:  Investigator Initiated IND  Phase I/II  
INDICATION(S):  Treatment with gemcabene is indicated as an adjunct standard of care to diet 
to reduce triglyceride (TG) levels and indicators of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in 
adult  patients  with Familial Partial Lipodystrophy Disease  (FPLD ) 
OBJECTIVE:   
The overall  objective of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety  of two dosing regimens of 
gemcabene (300 mg once daily ( QD) for 24 weeks or 300 mg QD for 12 weeks followed by 600 
mg QD for 12 weeks ) in up to eight patients with FPLD  with elevated TGs and NAFLD .   
POPULATION:  
Up to eight male and female patients, ≥  18 years of age with confirmed FPLD  will be enrolled in 
the study . Patients must have a fasting TG value ≥ 250 mg/dL and quantifiable hepatic steatosis 
(as determined by magnetic resonance proton density fat fraction [ MRI -PDFF]  – Stage 2 or 3) 
while on a  stable, low -fat, low -cholesterol diet  (per self- report) . 
STUDY DESIGN:  
Although this is a  pilot IND study, measures must be put in place to stabilize TG measures at 
baseline and concomitant TG -lowering therapies to ensure the collection of meaningful data 
during study conduct. 
Pre-Screeni ng Visit/Wash -Out Period:  A Pre -Screening Visit followed by a Wash -Out Period 
will be required for eligible patients taking fibrates, niacin ≥ 250 mg /day or over -the-counter fish 
oil or other products containing omega -3 fatty acids (OMG -3), or thiazolidined iones (TZDs). For 
patients requiring a Wash -Out Period, the Pre -Screening Visit will be their first study visit and 
will occur prior to the Screening Visit based on the duration of the Wash- Out Period required.  
Patients currently taking fibrates, niacin ≥ 250 mg /day, prescription or over -the-counter fish oil or 
other products containing OMG -3, or TZDs must be able to safely discontinue therapy at 
screening. The Wash -Out Period will be six weeks. If patients are on metreleptin for 
investigational use, they should be washed out for four months and their leptin level must have 
returned to pre -metreleptin treatment state, which is indirect evidence that any binding antibodies 
may have decayed as well.

Confidential & Proprietary   
Version 2. 4, 9/11/ 2019  5 Screening Period:  All eligible patients will participate in the Screening Visit up to 28 days prior 
to Day 1. For eligible patients taking stable, allowable, lipid- lowering therapy (statins, ezetimibe, 
proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 [ PCSK9 ] inhibitors, or oth er herbal products or 
dietary supplements with potential lipid -altering effects) for greater than six weeks and who do 
not require a Wash -Out Period, the Screening Visit will be their first study visit.  
At the end of the two- to four -week diet and lifestyl e stabilization and TG qualifying period, 
eligible patients must have a fasting TG ≥ 250 mg/dL prior to their MRI -PDFF performed at Visit 
S2. The TG level for qualification will be based on Visit S1. If a patient's TG value from Visit S1 
falls outside the required range for entry into the study, one additional sample for fasting TG 
measurement can be collected between Visits S1 and S2.   
At Visit S2 potential patients must have hepatic steatosis ≥ 10% based on the core imaging lab 
assessment of liver fat con tent (MRI -PDFF) to be eligible for enrollment  on Day 1 (Visit T1).   If 
the core imaging lab assessment of liver fat content is below the minimum range outlined in the 
protocol the patient will be ineligible and will not be eligible for re -screening.  A de termination 
of hepatic fibrosis (MR elastography) will also be performed at this visit.    
Patients meeting screening criteria including TG and 10% liver fat will be offered an optional  liver 
biopsy which will be performed for the assessment of a baseline NAFLD Activity Score ( NAS ). 
If patients opt -out of the liver biopsy, they can still move to the treatment phase.  
Open -label, Randomized  Treatment Period:  After confirmation of qualifying fasting TG values  
and MRI -PDFF confirmed hepatic steatosis ≥ 10%, eligible patients will have a fasting , optional  
liver biopsy performed , if they opt in , and enter  the treatment phase to receive 300 mg gemcabene 
daily for 12 weeks starting on Day 1/Visit T1. Up to eight patients will be treated. After 12 weeks 
at visit T 4, patients will be randomized 1:1 according to a pre -generated randomization code to 
the remaining 12 - week treatment period  to one of the following groups :  
• Group 1:  Gemcabene 300 mg QD for 12- 24 weeks  
• Group 2: Gemcabene 600 mg QD for 12 -24 weeks  
The prim ary evaluation of TG efficacy will be after 12 weeks of treatment.  The primary 
evaluation for the secondary parameters of liver fat (MRI -PDFF) and NAS (histology) will be at 
24 weeks.  The Follow -up Visit will occur four weeks (±3 days) after the last dos e of study drug.  
DOSAGE FORMS AND ROUTE OF ADMINISTRATION:  
The tablet drug product for oral administration is an immediate -release tablet containing 300 mg 
of the parent gemcabene  in a formulation comprising the following inactive ingredients: lactose 
monohydrate, hydroxypropyl cellulose, croscarmellose sodium magnesium stearate, Opadry® 
White YS 1 -7040, and Simethicone.  
Study drug will be packaged in high- density polyethylene bottles with child -resistant closures.  
• 300 mg: one 300 mg tablet orally QD, or  
• 600 mg; two 300 mg tablets orally QD.

coagulation, and urinalysis) with particular attention to hepatic (e.g., ALT/AST , bilirubin, alkaline 
phosphatase, GGT, renal (e.g., blood urea nitrogen [BUN] , serum creatinine, protein:creatinine 
ratio, albumin/creatinine ratio, urinalysis sediments, pH, electrolytes), and skeletal muscle 
toxicities (i.e., creatine kinase) , ketone bodies, 12- lead electrocardiograms (ECGs), physi cal 
examinations, and vital signs . 
STATISTICAL METHODS : 
Patient Populations : 
The Full Analysis Set (FAS) is defined as all randomized patients who received at least one dose 
of study drug, and have both a baseline and at least one post -baseline lipid value.  All efficacy 
summaries and analyses will be performed using the FAS.  
The Safety Analysis Set (SAS) is defined as all randomized patients who received at least one 
dose of study drug.  All safety summaries will be performed using the SAS. 
Primary efficacy analyse s: 
The primary efficacy endpoint is the percent change from baseline to Week 1 2 in fasting serum 
TG. If the Week 12 TG value is missing, then the “Week 12 ” TG value will be imputed using 
last observation carried forward (LOCF).  
Baseline will be defined as the average of the pre -dose Day 1/Visit T1 value and the last 
qualifying screening visit .   
The primary efficacy endpoint will be summarized by treatment group and timepoint using the 
FAS.  
Secondary efficacy analyses:  
The s econdary TG efficacy endpoint s are t he change from baseline to Week 12 and change and 
percent change from baseline to the average of Weeks 6 and 12, and Week 24 in fasting serum 
TG.  Baseline will be defined as outlined above for the primary variable.  For the “average of 
Weeks 6 and 12” TG efficacy assessment , if only the Week 6 or Week 12 TG value is available, 
then that single value will be used .  If both the Week 6 and Week 12 TG values are missing, then 
the average “Week 6 and Week 12” TG value will be impu ted using LOCF. For the “Week 24” 
TG efficacy assessment, if Week 24 values are missing, then the value will be imputed using 
LOCF.  
The change and percent change in all other secondary efficacy biomarkers will be summarized for 
Week 12 and Week 24 as descr ibed above.

Version 2. 4, 9/11/ 2019  8 An additional secondary analysis  is change and percent change from baseline to Week 12 and 
Week 24 in the percentage of liver fat content as measured by MRI -PDFF.  Baseline liver fat 
content is defined as the value from Screening .  Missing pe rcentage liver fat content at Week 24 
will be imputed using LOCF.  It will be summarized by treatment group and timepoint using the 
FAS.   Hepatic fibrosis as measured by MR  elastography  will be summarized as outlined above 
for liver fat content via MRI -PDFF.  
An additional secondary analysis in c hange and percent change from baseline to Week 24 in NAS 
as determined by histology. It will be summarized by treatment group at Week 24  using the FAS.  
Exploratory efficacy analyses:  
The exploratory variables (if determined as necessary) will be summarized as described for the 
secondary endpoints above.  Missing values will be imputed using LOCF.  
Safety analyses : 
Safety will be assessed using the SAS.  The assessment of safety will include adverse events, 
clinical laboratory assessments, ECGs, physical examinations, and vital signs. The safety analysis 
will be based primarily on the frequency of new or worsening adverse events, laboratory 
abnormalities, and SAEs. Other safety data will be summarized as appropri ate.  
Adverse events will be coded using the most recent version of the Medical Dictionary for 
Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) and summarized by treatment group, system organ class, and 
preferred term.  
Safety laboratory data will be summarized by treatment group at baseline (pre -dose Day 1/Visit 1 
value), End of Treatment (Week 24), or the ET Visit, if applicable, and change from baseline to 
End of Treatment (Week 24) or the ET Visit, if applicable. Frequency counts of new or worsening 
abnormalities will als o be provided.

Version 2. 4, 9/11/ 2019  16 1 INTRODUCTION AND BACK GROUND INFORMATION 
1.1 Background  
Gemcabene calcium is the monocalcium salt of a dialkyl ether dicarboxylic acid having 2 terminal 
gem dimethyl carboxylate moieties. Gemcabene has a dual mechanism of action that involves: (1) enhancing the clearance of very -low density lipoprotein cholesterol ( VLDL ); and (2) blocking the 
overall production of hepatic triglyceride  (TG) and cholesterol synthesis.  
Gemcabene enhances the clearance of VLDL by decreasing the production of messenger RNA (mRNA) of the APOC3 gene, thereby decreasing the production of the A poC-III protein  
1. This in 
turn unmasks  apolipoprotein E (ApoE)  which (1) enhances the  clearance of the VLDL remnants 
via ApoE remnant receptors ; (2) reduces the formation of low -density lipoprotein ( LDL ) particles ; 
and (3)  enhances  lipoprotein lipase mediated TG lipolysis allowing increased  deliver y of fatty 
acids to muscle and adipose tissue.  
Gemcabene may also block the overall production of hepatic TG  and cholesterol. Given its 
structural similarities to long -chain fatty acid, gemcabene may act as an inhibitor of acetyl CoA 
acetytransferase ( ACC ), subsequently leading to a decrease  in hepatic TG production 2. 
Gemcabene may also inhibit one or more enzymes in the cholesterol synthesis pathway leading to 
less cholesterol in the cell, thereby upregulating LDL receptors  in the liver.  
In inflammatory states, cytokines, such as interleukin -6 (IL -6) and interleukin 1- beta (IL1-b), 
activate nuclear hormone receptors (NHRs) , such as C/EPB -b, C/EPB -d and nuclear factor kappa 
B (NF -kB), and lead them to bind to the C -reactive protein ( CRP ) promoter and increase CRP 
mRNA production. Based on preclinical studies, gemcabene may inhibi t the interaction of these 
NHRs on the CRP promoter and therefore reduce CRP mRNA production 3.  
Taken together, gemcabene’s mechanism of action should lower the full range of atherogeni c 
particles (VLDL, IDL, and LDL) resulting in decreases in atherogenic particle number ( ApoB), 
particle cholesterol (non -HDL -C) and TG  (when elevated); with concomitant lowering of hsCRP.  
As such, the effects of gemcabene  were explored in a pre -clinical model of NAFLD  (STAM mice).  
Overall, gemcabene show ed an anti -fibrotic effect, as well as demonstrating anti -NASH and 
hepatoprotective effects on the liver pathology in this model . Treatment with middle and high 
doses of Gemcabene reduced the mRNA expression levels of inflammation related genes (TNF -α, 
Monocyte chemotactic protein- 1 (MCP -1), Macrophage inflammatory protein- 1 (MIP -1β), CCR5, 
CCR2, NF -kβ), supporting hepatoprotective property. Gemcabene decreased plasma CRP levels , 
which was in agreement with human data  4. The pre clinical data is supportive of the potential for 
gemcabene to elicit beneficial effects in hepatic steatosis.  
Gemcabene- calcium rapidly converts to gemcabene free acid when in contact with the gastric 
fluid. Gemcabene is rapidly absorbed following oral adm inistration . It distributes to the liver where 
it has its effect as the active molecule, with exposure increasing approximately linearly with dose. 
Steady state concentrations are achieved within six days of repeated dose administration, with an 
average half -life from 32 to 41 hours. Gemcabene's primary route of metabolism and elimination 
is renal , predominantly as a gemcabene glucuronide formed in the kidney .

Version 2. 4, 9/11/ 2019  17 1.2 Rationale   
Patients with typical Familial Partial Lipodystrophy Disease  (FPLD ) have a mar ked loss of 
subcutaneous fat from the extremities and trunk accompanied by a variable amount of excess fat 
deposition in the nonlipodystrophic areas such as the face, chin, back, and intraabdominal regions  
5-7. Dietary fat restriction and other lifestyle changes are first line therapy to avoid  weight gain, 
critical for effective management of metabolic complications in patients with lipodystrophy. However, despite lifestyle changes and conventional hypoglycemic and hypolipidemic therapies, some FPLD  patients continue to have extreme hypertrigly ceridemia, hepatic steatosis, and poorly 
controlled diabetes  
8,9. 
Hypertriglyceridemia is a common condition of FPLD  and serum triglyceride  levels of 250–1999 
mg/dL, classified as moderate to severe hypertriglyceridemia, indicate risk for development of very severe hypertriglyceridemia, causative of pancreatiti s and hepatic steatosis  
10,11. In patients 
such as those with FPLD  with severe or very severe hypertriglyceridemia, fibrates, omega -3 fatty 
acids ( OMG- 3) and occasionally niacin are first -line therapy.  
Fibrates decrease TG levels by 30 –50% and sometimes increase HDL -C levels in patients with 
hypertriglyceridemia  12. In patients with high TG levels, LDL -C levels may increase during 
therapy, likely due to an increased conversion of VLDL to LDL.  Side effects associated with 
fibrates may include elevated liver enzymes, increased CK , and hyperhomocysteinemia. Fibrates 
are contraindicated in patients with liver and gall bladder disease and should be used with caution in renal insufficiency  
12. Omega -3 fatty acids are used in the tr eatment of patients with 
hypertriglyceridemia .  To achieve a TG reduction of 20–50%, administration of 3–4 g/d of EPA 
plus DHA given in multiple capsules  is required  13. As with fibrates, with the reductions of TG 
levels there can be increased levels of LDL -C 12. Niacin lowers TG and increases HDL -C levels 
in patients with hypertriglyceridemia .  At doses of 500 to 2000 mg/d, niacin lowers TG by 10–
30%, increases HDL -C by 10 –40%, and lowers LDL -C by 5 –20%  14. Increased risk of flushing, 
diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, cough, and pruritus with niacin has tended to limit its use in general 
practice. Moreover, when co- administered with lovastatin or simvastatin, the risk of 
rhabdomyolysis and abnormal liver function is increased, particularly in the elderly and in patients with diabetes, CKD, or uncontrolled hypothyroidism  
15.  Background statin therapy is increasingly 
common in patients with moderate1 to severe hypertriglyceridemia, however, patients with FPLD  
are often statin intolerant.  
NAFLD is often associated with FPLD . We reported the spectrum  of NAFLD associated with 
FPLD which appears to be more frequent than what is seen in common Type 2 diabetes and appears 
more severe than common forms of NAFLD  16 and very often associated with NASH . The e tiology 
for the latter is not clear, however, the fact that a mouse model of liver specific laminopathy 
develops NASH in a cell –autonomous manner s uggests 17that the specific cellular defects seen in 
FPLD may play a role in the development of NAFLD/NASH.  Triglyceride content in the liver is 
regulated by fatty acid uptake as well as fatty acid and VLDL production rates. Derangements in 
these processes, such as excessive production of fatty acids and TGs that can occur with excessive carbohydrate consumption contribute to NAFLD  
18. Patients with NAFLD compared to controls, 
present with an atherogenic dyslipidemic profile, characterized by increased serum levels of TGs, 
ApoB, VLDL -C, and LDL -C with a proportionally greater content of small dense LDL -C (sdLDL-
C) 18-20. NAFLD is also associated with aberrant nuclear receptor function and systemic

Version 2. 4, 9/11/ 2019  18 inflammation  21. NAFLD can p rogress to NASH. NAS H is marked by hepatocyte ballooning and 
liver inflammation, which may progress to scarring and irreversible damage. Macro and 
microscopically, NASH is characterized by lobular and/or portal inflammation, varying degrees of fibrosis, he patocyte death and pathological angiogenesis. At its most severe, NASH can 
progress to cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and liver failure. It is estimated that 20 -33% 
NAFLD patients will progress to NASH, with about 5% ultimately progressing to ci rrhosis .  
Cirrhosis has a reported 7-  to 10- year mortality of 12 -25% 
22-24.  
As NAFLD and NASH continue to be a growing epidemic, gemcabene’s clinical and preclinical data suggest that this novel agent may p rovide benefit to patients with the diagnosis of NAFLD 
and/or NASH. As such, further development of gemcabene may help meet an unmet medical need in these patient populations. 
In Phase 2 studies, g emcabene has shown TG lowering from 20 to >  50% based on dose and 
severity of hypertriglyceridemia  and lowering in hsCRP of up to 50% .  Additionally, in animal 
and cell based models, gemcabene studies have provided evidence demonstrating: reduction in de -
novo lipogenesis, reduction in intrahepatic TG levels, modul ation of inflammation and reduction 
of the NAFLD activity score, particularly related to hepatic ballooning, steatosis, fibrosis, and 
collagen accumulation.  As such gemcabene may have utility in hypertriglyceridemia of FLP and 
ultimately in the prevention  or treatment of NASH in these patients.  
1.3 Risk Assessment of Gemcabene  
The clinical program conducted to date has demonstrated that gemcabene is generally well 
tolerated.  A total of 895 healthy adult volunteers and patients with various underlying conditions 
(including dyslipidemia, osteoarthritis, and hypertension) have been exposed to a minimum of at least one dose of gemcabene at doses ranging from 150 mg to 1500 mg once daily ( QD). This 
includes 837 patients  who received multiple doses of up to 900 mg for up to 12 weeks .  This also 
includes 292 patients (150 patients on high -intensity) on gemcabene in combination with a statin.   
Safety of these patients  was evaluated by adverse event monitoring, clinical laboratory 
assessments, electrocardiograms (ECGs), physical examinations, and vital sign assessments.  
No significant drug -drug interactions have been observed with simvastatin (80 mg), atorvastatin 
(80 mg), or digoxin (0.25 mg). No clinically relevant effect o n QTc or blood pressure has been  
observed.  
Across all clinical studies, the majority of  treatment- emergent adverse events  were mild to 
moderate in intensity. The most common adverse events reported include d headache, asthenia 
(feeling of weakness), nausea, dizziness, dyspe psia (upset stomach), infection , abnormal bowel 
movements, myalgia, and abnormal kidney function tests. Ten patients (1%) reported a treatment -
emergent serious adverse event ( SAE ) across all previous studies . None of these SAEs were 
considered treatment -related.  There were no deaths.  
Small mean increases in serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) have been observed in 
some studies. These changes appeared within the first two to four weeks and did not appear to 
increase further over time. An iohexol clearance study showed that glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) 
slightly decreased and was associated with a slight increase in serum creatinine. There was no 
indication of proteinuria or hematuria identified in any patient . There were n o significant changes

Version 2. 4, 9/11/ 2019  19 observed in urine protein, which seems to indicate that gemcabene does not cause tubular or 
glomerular injury. And, the increase was reversible with all creatinine values returning to baseline 
within approximately two weeks of cessati on of gemcabene, suggesting a vascular effect and not 
renal injury.  
Based on a prospective analysis in a gemcabene monotherapy study (1027- 04) in patients with 
mild-moderate hypertriglyceridemia (TG ≥ 2 00 mg/dL) and a retrospective meta- analysis of all 
studies that tested gemcabene monotherapy in patients with mild to severe hypertriglyceridemia 
(1027- 04, 1027- 14 [healthy, obese patients], and 4141001 [monotherapy arm of a study in 
hyperlipidemia patients +/-  atorvastatin], we conclude that the 300 mg once  daily (QD) dose is 
optimal based for gemcabene monotherapy.  The 600 mg dose will also be included for the following reasons: gemcabene has a U -shaped TG dose response curve in Type IV patients and 
including both 300 and 600 mg may further elucidate the m echanism; and although TG lowering 
is mitigated at gemcabene 600 mg in HTG patients, LDL -C was significantly lowered at the 600 
mg dose by a median % change of 17% (p=0.026).  In addition, those studies that evaluated hsCRP showed approximately a 50% lower ing at gemcabene 600 mg. Therefore, we propose including 
the 300 mg and 600 mg dose to assess preliminary efficacy and safety in this preliminary study of FPLD  patients.

Version 2. 4, 9/11/ 2019  22 3 STUDY DESCRIPTION 
3.1 Summary of Study Design  
Although this is a pilot IND  study, measures must be put in place to stabilize TG measures at 
baseline and concomitant TG -lowering therapies to ensure the collection of meaningful data during 
study conduct.  The s tudy will consist of a six week Wash Out Period, up to a 28- day Screening 
Period, a 24 week Treatment Period, and a follow -on safety assessment four weeks post final dose. 
Below is a general description of each Period of the study.  
Pre-Screening Visit/ Wash -Out Period  
A Pre-Screening Visit followed by a Wash -Out Period will be required for eligible patients taking 
fibrates , niacin ≥250 mg/day  or over -the-counter fish oil or other products containing omega -3 
fatty acids (OMG -3), or thiazolidinediones  (TZDs). For patients requiring a Wash -Out Period, the 
Pre-Screening Visit will be their first study visit and will occur prior to the Screening Visit based 
on the  duration of the Wash- Out Period required.  
Patients currently taking fibrates , niacin ≥250 m g/day, prescription or over -the-counter fish oil or 
other products containing OMG -3, or  TZDs must be able to safely discontinue therapy at 
screening. The Wash -Out Period will be six weeks. If patients are on metreleptin for 
investigational use, they should be washed out for four months and their leptin level must have 
returned to pre -metreleptin treatment state , which is indirect evidence that any binding antibodies 
may have decayed as well.  
Screening Period  
All eligible patients will participate in the Scr eening Visit up to 28 days prior to Day 1. For eligible 
patients taking stable , allowable, lipid -lowering therapy (statins, ezetimibe,  proprotein convertase 
subtilisin/kexin type 9 [ PCSK9 ] inhibitors, or other herbal products or dietary supplements with 
potential lipid -altering effects) for greater than s ix weeks and who do not require a Wash- Out 
Period, the Screening Visit will be their first study visit.  
At the end of the two -to four -week diet and lifestyle stabilization and TG qualifying period, eligible 
patients must have a fasting TG ≥  250 mg/d L prior to their MRI -PDFF performed at Visit S2. The 
TG level for qualification will be based on Visit S1 . If a patient's TG value from Visit S1 falls 
outside the required range for entry into the study, one additional sample for fasting TG 
measurement can be collected between Visits S1 and S 2.   
During this Screening Period, potential patient s must have hepatic steatosis of 10% based on the 
core imaging lab assessment of liver fat content ( MRI -PDFF ) to be eligible for enrollment  on Day 
1 (Visit T1).   If the core imaging lab assessment of liver fat content is below the minimum range 
outlined in the protocol the patient will be ineligible and will not be eligible for re -screening.  A 
determination of hepatic fibrosis (MR elastography) will also be performed during Screening.    
Patients meeting screening criteria including TG and 10% liver fat will be offered an optional liver  
biopsy performed for the assessment of a baseline NAS .

Version 2. 4, 9/11/ 2019  23 After confirmation of qualifying fasting TG values and MRI -PDFF confirmed hepatic steatosis 
≥10%, eligible patients will have a fasting liver b iopsy performed, if they opt in, and enter the 
treatment phase to receive 300 mg gemcabene daily for 12 weeks starting on Day 1/Visit T1. Up 
to eight patients will be treated. After 12 weeks at visit T 4, patients will be randomized 1:1 
according to a pre- generated randomization code to the remaining 12 - week treatment period:  
• Group 1: Gemcabene 300 mg QD for 12- 24 weeks  
• Group 2: Gemcabene 600 mg QD for 12- 24 weeks  
The primary evaluation of TG efficacy will be after 12 weeks of treatment.  The primary 
evalu ation for the secondary parameters of liver fat (MRI -PDFF) and NAS (histology) will be at 
24 weeks.   
Safety Follow -Up Assessment 4 Weeks Post -Final Dose   
The Follow -up telephone call will occur four weeks (±3 days) after the last dose of study drug.  
3.2 Study  Indication  
Treatment with gemcabene is indicated as an adjunct to diet to reduce TG levels and indicators of 
nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in adult patients with Familial Partial Lipodystrophy Disease ( FPLD ).

Version 2. 4, 9/11/ 2019  28 5 STUDY TREATMENTS  
5.1 Treatment Groups  
Up to eight patients will enter the treatment phase to receive 300 mg gemcabene daily for 12 weeks 
starting on Day 1/Visit T1. After 12 weeks of treatment, at visit T 4, patients will be randomized 
1:1 according to a pre -generated randomiza tion code to either of the following groups:  
  Group 1: Gemcabene 300 mg QD for weeks 12- 24 
 Group 2:  Gemcabene 600 mg QD for weeks 12- 24 
5.2 Dose Rationale  
Based on a prospective analysis in a gemcabene monotherapy study (1027- 04) in patients with 
mild-moder ate hypertriglyceridemia (TG ≥ 2 00 mg/dL) and a retrospective meta- analysis of all 
studies that tested gemcabene monotherapy in patients with mild to severe hypertriglyceridemia (1027- 04, 1027- 14 [healthy, obese patients], and 4141001 [monotherapy arm of a  study in 
hyperlipidemia patients +/-  atorvastatin], we conclude that the 300 mg once daily (QD) dose is 
optimal. The 600 mg dose will also be included for the following reasons: gemcabene has a U -
shaped TG dose response curve in Type IV patients and including both 300 and 600 mg may further elucidate the mechanism; and although TG lowering is mitigated at gemcabene 600 mg in HTG patients, LDL -C was significantly lowered at the 600 mg dose by a median % change of 17% 
(p=0.026) .  In addition, those studies t hat evaluated hsCRP showed approximately a 50% lowering 
at gemcabene 600 mg. Therefore, we propose including the 300 mg and 600 mg dose to assess preliminary efficacy and safety in this study of  FPLD  patients.  
Study 1027- 04 
In a pre -specified analysis in p atients with TG ≥ 2 00 mg/dL (Study 1027 -04) gemcabene lowered 
TG by a median % change at 12 weeks of by 27% (p < 0.05), 39% (p < 0.01), 13% ( p = 0.623), and 
9% (p  = 0.952) at the 150 mg, 300 mg, 600 mg, and 900 mg doses, respectively, compared to a 5% 
lowering for placebo. The dose response curve was U -shaped with the maximum effect at 300 mg. 
There was a correlative decrease in ApoC -III of 24% (p < 0 .05) and 31% (p < 0.01) at the 150mg 
and 300 mg doses, respectively.  There was also a statistically significant lowering of ApoE by 37% (p < 0 .01) at 300 mg.   
Similar to OMG -3 compounds and fibrates, gemcabene increases LDL -C in patients with isolated 
hypertriglyceridemia  (Type IV) when TG levels are lowered.  Small non- significant increases in 
LDL- C at gemcabene 150 mg and 300 mg and significant lowering in LDL -C of 17% ( p = 0.026) 
and 23% (p < 0.001) at gemcabene 600 mg and 900 mg, respectively; compared to an increase o f 
0.4% on placebo were observed.  It is hypothesized that in this population treated patients are shifting from a pattern A to pattern B profile, whereby larger less atherogenic LDL particles are being formed.  This is supported by a moderate non -significa nt decrease in ApoB across all doses.  
Retrospective Meta -Analysis  
A retrospective meta -analysis of  the effect of gemcabene monotherapy on TG in patients exposed 
to drug for at least 50 days included studies 1027- 04 (low HDL), 1027 -14 (healthy obese) and

effect of gemcabene in patients on background statin was also analyzed (1027- 18). 
The sub- cut of gemcabene monotherapy patients with TG ≥ 200 mg/dL had a median % lowering 
in TG of 25% ( p = 0.0192) and 32% ( p = 0.0051) for gemcabene 150 mg ( n = 22) and 300 mg ( n = 
27), respectively, compared to a lowering of 3% for placebo ( n = 31).   No significant differences 
were observed in TG levels at the 600 mg or 900 mg doses versus placebo.  Gemcabene in 
combination with statin had a median % lowering in TG similar to monotherapy: 38% ( p = 0.0067) 
for gemcabene 300 mg + statin ( n = 23), 46% (p  = 0.0028) for gemcabene 600mg + statin ( n = 13) 
compared to a lowering of 19% with statin alone ( n = 26).   
5.3 Randomization and Blinding  
Patients  who have completed the Screening  Visit and meet all inclusion and none of exclusion 
criteria  will be gin treatment on Study  Day 1 . At week 12 (Visit T4) subjects will be randomized 
to either 300 mg gemcabene or 600 mg gemcabene for the remiaing 12 weeks of study.  Randomized treatment assignment and randomization numbers will be assigned by paper .

An overview of the visits is below with a tabular listing of the Schedule of Procedures located in 
Appendix A. Assessments that require a patient to fast will be defined as no food or caloric 
beverage (tea and black coffee are allowed) for at least eight hours prior to sample collection. 
Patients will be permitted to have water.  
6.1 Informed Consent  
Written informed consent for the study will be obtained from all patient s before any 
protocol -specific procedures are performed. See Section 12.3 for details on informed consent.  
6.2 Pre-Screening Visit  
Only patients  with a history within the past year of TG  ≥ 200 mg/dL on current TG -lowering 
therapy and requiring a Wash -Out Period will participate in the Pre- Screening Visit.  
A six-week Wash-Out Period will be required for eligible patients taking fibrates , niacin ≥250 
mg/day, prescription or over -the-counter fish oil or other products containing OMG -3, or TZDs .  
If patients are on metreleptin for investigational use, they should be washed out for four months 
and their leptin level must have returned to pre -metreleptin treatment state which is indirect 
evidence that any binding antibodies may have decayed as well.  
Refer to Appendix A for  procedures that will be performed at the Pre- Screening Visit.  
6.3 Screening Visit s 
 All eligible patients will participate in the Screening Period  up to 28 days prior to Day 1. For 
eligible patients taking stable allowable , lipid-lowering therapy (statins, ezetimibe, niacin, PCSK9 
inhibitors, or other herbal products or dietary supplements with potential lipid- altering effects) for 
greater than six  weeks and who do not require a Wash- Out Period, the Screening Visit will be their 
first study visit. To qualify for enrollment in  the treatment period, the fasting  TG measurement at 
Visit S1 must be ≥ 250 mg/dL ( 2.83 mmol/L) .  If a patient's TG value from S1 falls outside the 
required range for entry into the study, one additional sample for fasting TG measurement can be collected prior to S2.  
At Visit S2 potential patients must have hepatic steatosis ≥ 10% based on the core imaging lab 
assessment of liver fat content (MRI -PDFF) to be eligible for enrollment on Day 1 (Visit T1).   If 
the core imaging lab assessment of liver fat content is below the minimum range outlined in the protocol the patient will b e ineligible and will not be eligible for re -screening.  A determination of 
hepatic fibrosis (MR elastography) will also be performed at this visit.    
Patients meeting screening criteria including TG and 10% liver fat will be offered an optional liver  
biopsy performed for the assessment of a baseline NAS. If all of the inclusion criteria (Section 4.1) 
are met and the patient has none of the exclusion criteria (Section 4.2) the patient may be 
randomized into the 12- week treatment period.

Patients may be receiving statins, ezetimibe, PCSK9 inhibitors, or other herbal products or 
dietary supplements with potential lipid- altering effects only if therapy is  stable for greater 
than six  weeks prior to Screenin g Visit 1.  
For patients determined as ineligible based on TG levels < 250 mg/dL at Visit S1 ONLY a fasting lipid panel for the measurement of TGs can  be reassessed at an interim visit between 
Visits S1 and S2.  
For patients who required a wash- out period a nd completed the Pre -Screening Visit, the following 
Screening Visit procedures will not  be repeated: informed consent, full physical examination, 
height, TSH,  and serology  (HBV, HCV, and HIV) . Updates, as needed, will be made to 
medical/surgical history, demographics, and concomitant medications.   
Refer to Appendix A for procedures that will be performed at the Screening  Visit S1 ( up to Day -
28). 
6.3.2 Screening Visit S 2  
Patients with a qualifying TG  level ≥250 mg/dL will have an assessment of liver fat content to 
determine eligibility as measured by MRI -PDFF.  If this core imaging lab assessment of liver fat 
is below 10%  the patient will be ineligible for enrollment and will not be eligible for re -screening.  
A determination of hepatic fibrosis (MR elastography) will also be performed at this visit.

The magnetic resonance imaging –estimated proton density fat fraction (MRI -PDFF)  is a novel 
imaging -based biomarker that allows fat mapping of the entire liver and is independent of the 
scanner’s manufacturer and magnet strength.   MRI -PDFF is emerging as the leading biomarker 
for assessing treatment response in NASH trials to monitor  longitudinal changes in hepatic fat  25,26. 
MRI -PDFF is measured with advanced MRI techniques that minimize or correct the confounding 
factors (T1 bias, T2* bias, and multifrequency  interference effects of fat and eddy currents) that 
corrupt fat fraction estimations with conventional MRI -by a previously described and validated 
protocol  27-30. The protocol uses a gradient echo sequence with a low flip angle to minimize T1 
bias, and it acquires multiple echoes in which the multiple spectral peaks of lipid at and water interfere with respect to each other. Once d ata are acquired at each echo of the echo times, they 
pass to a fitting algorithm that estimates and corrects T2* effects, models the fat signal, and estimates fat and water proton densities; then, the fat content is calculated  
31,32.  
MRI -estimated PDFF has been validated against MRS as well as liver biopsy histological data . 
31,33,34. Hepatic fat quantificat ion via MRI -PDFF has been utilized in NASH clinical trials for 
quantitative fat assessment 25,29,35-37.  
Based on the correlations to biopsy, the ease of conduct, the extensive availability of MRI -PDFF 
this is the imaging technique that will be utilized in this pilot study of FPLD .

Version 2. 4, 9/11/ 2019  37 MR-elastog raphy will also be performed to assess tissue stiffness which has been shown to be 
associated with increased hepatic fibrosis42. 
Hepatic biopsy proven disease is the gold standard for diagnosis of NAFLD and NASH and for 
evaluation of treatment  38,39. However, hepatic biopsy has serious procedural related risks, e.g. 
bleeding, perforation and death, and consequently is not appropriate for frequent routi ne evaluation 
and follow -up in patients in the clinical setting.   
Although fat accumulation is generally considered diffuse in NAFLD and NASH, the distribution is non- uniform, which means any type of assessment that has limited spatial sampling may have 
high inter - and intra - observer variability  
40-42. Therefore, there is still the need for continued 
development of surrogates ( i.e., MRI -PDFF) for early and mid -stage clinical studies of potential 
therapies, as well as for following the treatment response in the clinical s etting.  
A determination of NAS (NAFLD activity score) including steatosis, lobular inflammation and 
hepatocyte ballooning will be calculated  from the liver biopsy if patients opted in for the liver 
biopsy .  In addition, markers of mechanism and effect will be assessed including syndecan.

8.1 Known Potential Risks  
The safety and efficacy profile of gemcabene has been developed through 18 Phase 1 and 2 studies 
including 1278 healthy volunteers and patients.  
Common adverse events include:  
• Headaches  
• Asthenia (feeling of weakness)  
• Nausea  
• Dizziness  
• Dyspepsia  
• Abnormal bowel movements  
• Myalgia (muscle pain)  
• Increased BUN  
• Increased creatinine 
Identified and Potential Important Risks:   
Based on the non -clinical and clinical safety data collected, important potential risks are liver 
findings, hemoglobin decrease, BUN and creatinine increase and myalgia. Importantly, only one 
patient had a transaminase elevation >3x ULN after receiving gemcabene 600 mg and atorvastatin 
80 mg. While hemoglobin decrease was seen in non- clinical toxicity studies, only small decreases 
in hemoglobin have been observed clinically and were also seen with placebo (not statistically significant). Small increases in creatinine and BUN were observed in clinical studies with 
gemcabene. The increases  appeared within the first two -to-four weeks of treatment and did not 
worsen over time.    
Other risks:  
• There is a possibility of rhabdomyolysis when combined with a statin. 
• Patients with a hypersensitivity to or who have a history of significant adverse reactions to any 
fibrate lipid lower agents should avoid gemcabene.  
• Patients on potent CYP 3A4 inhibitors such as itraconazole or a macrolide antibiotic should be 
excluded.  
• Based on non- clinical studies in rats, gemcabene should not be administered to pregnant 
women or women of childbearing potential not using effective methods to prevent pregnancy.  
• Gemcabene test s for carcinogenic activity  are under review by the FDA with additional data 
requested  for review  prior to  the initiation of studies greater than 6 months.

Version 2. 4, 9/11/ 2019  39 8.2 Risks from the procedures in the protocol:  
Procedures in this protocol include 1) blood draws ; 2) MRI ; 3) IV placement for repeated blood 
draws ; and 4) liver biopsy.  
8.3 Known Potential Benefits :  
Three Phase 2 studies have demonstrated that gemcabene is efficacious in reducing TGs in 
hypertriglyceridemic patients and LDL -C in hypercholesterolemic patients. As many FPLD  
patients (and patients with NA FLD) have high TGs and may have high LDL -C, this is a potential 
benefit for the participants.  
Gemcabene has also been demonstrated to reduce ApoB and hsCRP, both associated with 
cardiovascular disease risk. This is also a potential benefit to the particip ants. Within the study, 
participants will benefit from receiv ing lifestyle counseling. They will also receive regular 
assessments of their liver disease including labs (ALT, AST and GGT) and MRI ( hepatic 
steatosis ).   
Long range benefits could include sati sfaction from contributing to development of treatments for 
FPLD  and FPLD  with NAFLD.    
 
8.4 Assessment of Potential Risks and Benefits  
The rationale for the necessity of exposing patients  to the risks of participating in this study is that 
medications for FP LD are urgently needed.  
The value of the information to be gained outweighs the risks , because the risks are minimal and 
the information collected could be significantly valuable for the FPLD  population.  Patients in the 
study will benefit from receiving standard of care lifestyle counseling and from state of the art 
measurements of their liver disease.

Version 2. 4, 9/11/ 2019  40 9 SAFETY ASSESSMENTS  
9.1 Adverse Events  
An adverse event is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation patient  
administered a pharmaceutical product, which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with 
this treatment. An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and/or unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of an investigational medicinal product, whether or not related to the investigational medicinal product. All adverse events, including observed or volunteered problems, complaints, or symptoms, are to be recorded on the appropriate CRF . 
Adverse events, which include abnormal and clinically significant clinical laboratory test variables, will be monitored and documented from the time of first dose of study drug (Study Day 1) until s tudy par ticipation is complete  (the Follow -up Visit) . Patient s should be instructed to report 
any adverse event that they experience to the Investigator . Beginning with the signing of the 
informed consent  until the time of the first dose of study drug ( Study Day 1 ), investigators should 
make updates to medical history and record any pre -existing medical condition or signs or 
symptoms that changes in severity, frequency, or seriousness in the medical history . Serious 
adverse event s that occur prior to the first dose  of study drug ( Study Day 1 ) should be reported as 
an update to medical history as well as be reported on the appropriate adverse event CRF . 
Beginning with the first dose of study drug ( Study Day 1 ), investigators should make an 
assessment for adverse even ts at each visit and record all adverse event s, non- serious and serious,  
on the appropriate adverse event  CRF . 
Wherever possible, a specific disease or syndrome rather than individual associated signs and symptoms should be identified by the Investigator  and recorded on the CRF. However, if an 
observed or reported sign or symptom is not considered a component of a specific disease or syndrome by the Investigator , it should be recorded as a  separate adverse event on the CRF.  
Additionally, the condition that led to a medical or surgical procedure ( e.g., surgery, endoscopy, 
tooth extraction, or transfusion) should be recorded as an adverse event, not the procedure. Concomitant procedures should be recor ded as such on the appropriate CRF.  
Any medical condition al ready present prior to the patient taking the first dose of study drug ( Study 
Day 1 ) should be reported in the medical history. Any SAEs occurring prior to the first dose of 
study drug ( Study Day 1 ) should be reported as an update to medical history as w ell as an adverse 
event. Any pre -existing medical condition or signs or symptoms that changes  in severity , 
frequency,  or seriousness after the patient takes the first dose of study drug ( Study Day 1 ) and 
through the Follow -up Visit  should be reported as an adverse event.  
Clinically significant abnormal laboratory  values  or other examinations  (e.g., ECG ) that are 
detected at the time of the first dose of study drug ( Study Day 1 ) and worsen during the study 
should be reported as adverse event s. An abnormal la boratory result that is not verified by repeat 
testing does not necessitate reporting as an adverse event. The Investigator  will exercise his or her 
medical,  scientific , and clinical  judgment in deciding whether an abnormal laboratory finding or 
other abno rmal assessment is clinically significant. Clinically significant abnormal laboratory 
values occurring during the clinical study will be followed until repeat tests return to normal,

Version 2. 4, 9/11/ 2019  41 stabilize, or are no longer clinically significant. Any abnormal test tha t is determined to be an error 
does not require reporting as an adverse event.  
9.1.1 Adverse (Drug) Reaction  
For adverse events with a causal relationship to study drug, follow -up by the Investigator will be 
required until the event or its sequelae resolve or st abilize to a level acceptable to the Investigator.  
9.1.2 Unexpected Adverse Drug Reaction  
An Unexpected Adverse Drug Reaction is defined as an adverse reaction, the nature or severity of 
which is not consistent with the applicable product information (s ee Invest igator’s Brochure ). For 
gemcabene, the reference safety information is included in Section s 8.4 and 10 of the Investigator’s 
Brochure currently in force. The reference safety information will be reviewed yearly and the periodicity of the review will be har monized with the reporting period of the Development Safety 
Update Report.  
9.1.3 Assessment of Adverse Events by the Investigator  
The Investigator  will assess the severity (intensity) of each adverse event as mild, moderate, or 
severe, and will also categorize each adverse event as to its potential relationship to study drug using the categories of Y es or N o, as defined below . 
Assessment of Severity : 
Mild – An event that is easily tolerated and generally not interfering with normal daily activities.  
Moderate – An event that is sufficiently discomforting to interfere with normal daily activities.  
Severe – An event that is incapacitating with inability  to work or perform normal daily activities.  
Causality Assessment:  
The relationship of an adverse event to the administration of the study drug is to be assessed according to the following definitions:  
No ( unlikely related, unrelated, not related, no relat ion) – The time course between the 
administration of study drug and the occurrence or worsening of the adverse event rules out a causal relationship and another cause ( e.g., medical history, concomitant drugs, therapies, and 
complications ) is suspected.  
Yes ( possibly related, related) – The time course between the administration of study drug and the 
occurrence or worsening of the adverse event is consistent with a causal relationship and no other cause ( e.g., medical history, concomitant drugs, therapies , and complications ) can be identified.  
The definition implies a reasonable possibility of a causal relationship between the event and the study drug. This means that there are facts (evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal relationship.  
The following f actors should also be considered:  
• The temporal sequence from study drug administration -  
The University of Michigan  
Clinical Study Protocol HUM00130803 / GEM -IIT-602 
 
Confidential & Proprietary   
Version 2. 4, 9/11/ 2019  42 The event should occur after the study drug is given. The length of time from study drug exposure 
to event should be evaluated in the clinical context of the event.  
• Underlying, concomitant  diseases  (medical history)  - 
Each report should be evaluated in the context of the natural history and course of the disease being treated and any other disease the patient  may have.  
• Concomitant drug  - 
The other drugs the patient  is taking or the treatment the patient  receives should be examined to 
determine whether any of them might be recognized to cause the event in question.  
• Known response pattern for this class of study drug  - 
Clinical and/or preclinical data may indicate whether a particular response is likely to be a class effect.  
• Exposure to physical and/or mental stresses  - 
The exposure to stress might induce adverse changes in the recipient and provide a logical and better explanation for the event.  
• The pharmacology and PKs of  the study drug  - 
The known pharmacologic properties (absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion) of the study drug should be considered.  
9.2 Specific Safety Measures  
The safety paramet ers will be reviewed every 3 months by an Ind ependent Safety Monit or who 
will be Dr. James Shayman, a professor in the Department of Medic ine, Division of Nephrology 
and Pharmacology at the University of Michigan. Dr. Shayman is an experienced clinical 
investigator and also an inventor of new drugs that have gained FDA a pproval.  
9.2.1 Hemoglobin decrease  
For a hemoglobin decrease  of > 1.5 g/dL from baseline  during the study, repeat hematology studies 
and reflexive evaluation of reticulocyte count will be performed . The patient’s past medical 
history , concomitant medications (including over the counter drugs  and herbal supplements ), and 
any recent symptoms ( e.g., bleeding, shortness of breath, fatigue) will be reviewed to determine a 
potential etiology and make a clinical assessment of the significance of the finding .  Refer t o 
Appendix D for specific guidance.   
9.2.2 Creatinine increase  
If, at any visit, a creatinine increase of >  0.3 mg/dL (27 µmol/L) from baseline is observed, a repeat 
chemistry will be performed. The patient’s past medical history, concomitant medications 
(including over the counter drugs and herbal suppleme nts), and any recent symptoms ( e.g., fatigue, 
malaise, polyuria/oliguria, or palpitations) will be reviewed to determine a potential etiology and

guidance.  
9.2.3 Possible muscle and liver injury  
For muscle injury, CK, hepatic, and renal function laboratory data will be integrated with 
myopathy signs and symptoms. For management of CK elevations  > 3  ULN, refer to 
Appendix  D.  
 
For liver injury, laboratory data will be integrated with hepatic signs and symptoms. Monitoring  
and subsequent management of subject transaminase elevations is dependent upon baselinelevels, either < 2x ULN or ≥ 2x ULN at baseline.  R efer to Appendix D  for specific 
guidance and /or discontinuation of study drug recommendations. 
 
9.2.4 Significantly elevated TG levels   
In the event we see triglycerides>2000 mg/dL in a patient who did not have this high level at onset (many patients have very h igh triglycerides and no available therapy works for long term in the 
setting of the American diet and the social pressures, and this is one of the reasons why we want to undertake this study), we will contact the patient to review signs and symptoms of pa ncreatitis 
and we will evaluate diet information, have the patient meet with a dietician  to manage adherence 
to a heart -healthy diet, counsel patients regarding restric ted alcohol intake and diabetic control. 
We will repeat TG levels in 1 week. We will als o measure lipase levels in the follow -up blood 
draw.  
9.2.5 Patients with Diabetes  
In patients with diabetes, we will adjust concomitant medications to prevent hypoglycemia.  However, given the short nature of the study, we will not add any new medications to res cue for 
hyperglycemia unless fasting glucose levels exceed 230 mg/dL and/or patients have symptoms. Both hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia, as defined as fasting glucose >230 mg/dL will be captured as lipodystrophy events. 
9.3 Serious Adverse Event s 
An adverse ev ent or adverse reaction is considered serious if, in the view of either the Investigator  
or Sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes:  
• Death;  
• A life -threatening adverse event;  
NOTE: An adverse event or adverse reaction is considered “life -threat ening” if, in view of either 
the Investigator  or Sponsor, its occurrence places the patient  at immediate risk of death. It does 
not include an event that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.  
• Requires hospitalization or prolongat ion of existing hospitalizations;

Clinical Study Protocol HUM00130803 / GEM -IIT-602 
 
Confidential & Proprietary   
Version 2. 4, 9/11/ 2019  44 NOTE: Any hospital admission with at least one overnight stay will be considered an inpatient 
hospitalization. An emergency room visit without hospital admission will not be recorded as a SAE  under this criterion, nor will  hospitalization for a procedure scheduled or planned before 
signing of informed consent. However, unexpected complications and/or prolongation of hospitalization that occur during elective surgery should be recorded as adverse event s and 
assessed for seri ousness. Admission to the hospital for social or situational reasons ( i.e., no place 
to stay, live too far away to come for hospital visits) will not be considered inpatient hospitalizations.  
• A persistent or significant disability/incapacity or substantia l disruption of the ability to 
conduct normal life functions;  
• A congenital anomaly/birth defect; or  
• An important medical event.  
NOTE: Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospitalization may be considered an SAE when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or patient  and may require medical or surgi cal intervention to prevent 
one of the outcomes listed in this definition . Examples of such medical events include allergic 
bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalizations, or the development of drug dependency  or drug abuse . 
9.4 Adverse Event Reporting − Procedures for Sponsor Investigator  
9.4.1 Non-serious Adverse Events  
Each AE will be reported to the study investigator and the study investigator is responsible for 
completing and signing off on the AE reports.  Non- serious AEs will be reported to G emphire in 
aggregate at the end of the study .  The sponsor investigator will review a summary of all AEs 
monthly  and document this review .   
FPLD  related ev ents that are common in the study population (expected) and will be considered  
study endpoints include:  cardiac events, worsening abdominal pain requiring emergency room 
visits, urinary tract infections, acute pancreatitis in a patient with recurrent epis odes of pancreatitis, 
hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia, DKA or hyperosmolar state.   
These and any other adverse events will be recorded on the CRF and monitored to resolution or 30 days after end of the study.   
9.4.2 Serious Adverse Event Reporting 
The sponsor investigator  will report any qualifying Serious Adverse Event to MMS Holdings, 
Pharmacovigilance Department within 24 hours of learning of such event.   In addition to MMS 
Holdings, the Sponsor -Investigator may, at her discretion, report the SAE to any other required 
regulatory agencies , including the University of Michigan IRBMED according to IRBMED 
policy .Any serious adverse event (SAE), whether or not considered study intervention related,

Confidential & Proprietary   
Version 2. 4, 9/11/ 2019  45 including those listed in the protocol or investigator brochure and must include an assessment of 
whether there is a reasonable possibility that the study intervention caused the event.  
Study endpoints that are serious adverse events (e.g., FLP expected events ) must be reported in 
accordance with the protocol unless there  is evidence suggesting a causal relationship between the 
study intervention and the event (e.g., death from anaphylaxis). All events must be reported to MMS Holdings Pharmacovigilance, on behalf of Gemphire, within 24 hours of learning of such event.  
All serious adverse events (SAEs) will be followed until satisfactory resolution or until the 
investigator deems the event to be chronic or the participant is stable.  
The study sponsor ( Dr. Elif Oral ) with assistance from the MICHR MIAP group, will be 
respons ible for notifying the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of any unexpected fatal or life -
threatening suspected adverse reaction as soon as possible, but in no case later than seven calendar 
days after the sponsor's initial receipt of the information.  Une xpected, suspected serious adverse 
events will be reported to the FDA within 15 calendar days after the sponsor’s initial receipt of the information.  In addition, Gemphire  must notify FDA and all participating investigators in an 
Investigational New Drug (IND) safety report of potential serious risks, from clinical trials or any 
other source, as soon as possible, but in no case later than 15 calendar days after the sponsor determines that the information qualifies for reporting.  
All observed or volunteered SAEs regardless of treatment group or suspected causal relationship 
to the study drug will be reported as described below. If a SAE occurs, reporting to MMS Holdings 
Pharmacovigilance (Gemphire and Sponsor -Investigator’s Designee) must occur within 24 hours 
of learning of the event.  Reporting to UM IRBMED will be done according to IRBMED reporting 
guidelines.  
All SAEs and follow -up information must be reported to Gemphire or designee within two weeks 
of awareness of the event as required by your local requirements by emailing or faxing a completed 
SAE report form to the following:

A patient  becoming pregnant while on study drug will immediately be withdrawn from the study 
and early termination study procedures will be performed.  
The patient  should be followed by the Investigator  until com pletion of the pregnancy. If the 
pregnancy ends for any reason before the anticipated date, the Investigator  should notify MMS 
Drug Safety . At the completion of the pregnancy, the Investigator  will document the outcome of 
the pregnancy. If the outcome of t he pregnancy meets the criteria for immediate classification as 
an SAE ( i.e., postpartum complication, spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, neonatal death, or 
congenital anomaly), the Investigator  should follow the procedures for reporting an SAE.  
9.6 Expedited R eporting  
The Sponsor  Investigator  will report all relevant information about suspected unexpected serious 
adverse reactions that are fatal or life -threatening to the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) in 
accordance with 21 CFR 312.32 Information will also be submitted to the University of Michigan 
IRB (IRBMED) in accordance with IRBMED reporting guidelines.  
All other suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions will be reported to the FDA  in accordance 
with 21 CFR 312.32 and the IRBMED in accordance with IRBMED reporting guidelines.  
A copy will be sent to Gemphire as agreed upon in the Clinical Trial Agreement.  
9.7 Clinical Laboratory Evaluations  
Clinical laboratory evaluations will be collected at the visits  shown in the Schedule of Procedures 
(Appendix A) and the data captured will be forwarded to the site’s local laboratory for evaluation. Assessments that require a patient to fast will be defined as no food or caloric beverage for at least eight hours prior to sample collection.  Patients will be permitted to have water.  
Local  laboratory results that appear potentially misleading based on the Investigator’s clinical 
assessment and review of the patient’s medical history may be repeated for confirmation of t he 
finding. Reassessments of non- qualifying screening labs must be reviewed and approved by the 
Principal Investigator  prior to obtaining the new specimen. The clinical rationale for performing 
repeat testing of screening assessments should be thoroughly documented.

Measurement of vital signs will include an assessment of pulse rate, blood pressure, res piration 
rate, and temperature. Vital signs will be measured according to the Schedule of Procedures 
(Appendix A) . Blood pressure should be obtai ned in the seated position, after the patient  has rested 
comfortably for at least five minutes. Blood pressure  at the Screening Visit  should be obtained in 
both arms and the arm with the highest value should be used for ongoing monitoring throughout the rest of the study. If an automated assessment is performed, t he same machine should be used 
for the patient  throughout the study  when p ossible . Care should be taken to ensure an appropriate 
cuff size is utilized.   
9.9 Electrocardiograms  
Electrocardiograms will be performed in triplicate and sent to a central reviewer. Patients should be lying quietly in a fully supine position for at least 10 minutes prior to each 12- lead ECG.  A 12 -
lead ECG will be performed according to the Schedule of Procedures (Appendix A).

TG.  If the Week 12 TG value is missing, then the “ Week 12 ” TG value will be imputed using 
last observation carried forward (LOCF).  
Baseline will be defined as the average of the pre- dose Day 1/Visit T1 value and the last 
qualifying screening visit.   
The primary efficacy endpoint will be summarized by treatment group and timepoint using the 
FAS.  
10.3.1.2 Secondary efficacy analyses  
Secondary efficacy endpoints will also be summarized by treatment group and timepoint, using 
the FAS.  
The secondary TG efficacy endpoints are the change from baseline to Week 12 and change and  
percent change from baseline to the average of Weeks 6 and 12, and Week 24 in fasting serum TG.  Baseline will be defined as outlined above for the primary variable.  For the “average of Weeks 6 and 12” TG efficacy assessment, if only the Week 6 or Week 1 2 TG value is available, 
then that single value will be used.  If both the Week 6 and Week 12 TG values are missing, then the average “Week 6 and Week 12” TG value will be imputed using LOCF. For the “Week 24” TG efficacy assessment, if Week 24 values are missing, then the value will be imputed using 
LOCF.  
The change and percent change in all other secondary efficacy biomarkers will be summarized for Week 12 and Week 24 as described above.   
Baseline TC , HDL -C, and LDL -C are defined similarly to baseline for TG.  Baseline for fasting 
lipoproteins, hsCRP, SAA, IL -6, fibrinogen, IL -1β, ANGPTL4, ANGPTL3, are defined as the 
value from pre -dose Day 1/Visit T1.   
An additional secondary analysis is change and percent change fro m baseline to Week 12 and 
Week 24 in the percentage of hepatic steatosis (liver fat content) as measured by MRI -PDFF.  
Baseline liver fat content is defined as the value from Screening.  Missing percentage liver fat content at Week 24 will be imputed using  last LOCF.   
Hepatic fibrosis as measured by MR elastography will be summarized as outlined above for liver fat content via MRI -PDFF.  
An additional secondary analysis in change and percent change from baseline to Week 24 in NAS as determined by histology.

Version 2. 4, 9/11/ 2019  51 10.3.1.3 Exploratory analysis  
The exploratory variables will be summarized as described above.  Missing values will be 
imputed using LOCF.  
10.3.1.4 Missing Data  
The primary analyses of the primary , secondary and exploratory (if measured and analyzed) 
outcome variables will use LOCF for missing value.   
In the case of the presence of a substantial amount of missing data, sensitivity analyses will be 
carried out to evaluate the possible impact of missing data and may include multiple imputation or 
other techniques that allow for missing not at random. 
To summarize laboratory variables, consecutive time windows will be created around each planned 
visit.  In the descriptive statistics of laboratory variables, only measurements from scheduled visits will be  used if values are available. If no values from a scheduled visit are available but values 
from unscheduled visits are available, the values from the last unscheduled visit from that window will be us ed for the summary statistics. The results of all labora tory values from unscheduled and 
repeat measurements will be reco rded in the clinical database. In listings and narratives, all 
laboratory values including unscheduled and repeat values will be included. 
10.3.2 Analysis of Safety  
Safety will be assessed using the SAS.  The assessment of safety will include adverse events, 
clinical laboratory assessments, ECGs, physical examinations, and vital signs. The safety analysis will be based primarily on the frequency of new or worsening adverse events, laboratory abnormal ities, and SAEs. Other safety data will be summarized as appropriate.  
Adverse events will be coded using the most recent version of the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) and summarized by treatment group, system organ class, and preferred term.  
Safety laboratory data will be summarized by treatment group at baseline, End of Treatment (Week 24), or the ET Visit, if applicable, and change from baseline to End of Treatment (Week 24) or the ET Visit, if applicable. Frequency counts of new or worsening abnormalities will also be provided.

HEART FAILURE CLASSI FICATION  
• Class I: patients with cardiac disease but without resulting limitation of physical activity. 
Ordinary physical activity does not cause undue fatigue, palpitation, dyspnea, or anginal pain.  
• Class II: patients with cardiac disease resulting in slight limitation of ph ysical activity. They 
are comfortable at rest. Ordinary physical activity results in fatigue, palpitation, dyspnea, or 
anginal pain.  
• Class III: patients with cardiac disease resulting in marked limitation of physical activity. They 
are comfortable at rest.  Less than ordinary activity causes fatigue, palpitation, dyspnea, or 
anginal pain.  
• Class IV: patients with cardiac disease resulting in inability to carry on any physical activity 
without discomfort. Symptoms of heart failure or the anginal syndrome may be present even at rest. If any physical activity is undertaken, discomfort is increased.

HEPATIC MONITORING  
Hematology  
 
For a hemoglobin decrease of > 1.5 g/dL  from baseline during the study, repeat hematology studies 
and reflexive evaluation of reticulocyte count will be performed. The patient’s past medical history, concomitant medications (including over the counter drugs and herbal supplements), and any recent symptoms (e.g., bleeding, shortness of breath, fatigue) will be reviewed to determine a potential etiology and make a clinical assessment of the significance of the finding.  If hemoglobin falls >3.0 g/dL without any clear cause, then the investigator s hould discontinue the investigational 
product and hemoglobin should be monitored until it returns to a level of no less than 1.0 g/dL below baseline. At this time the investigator can consider restarting the investigational product and recheck hemoglobin l evels 1 and 2 weeks after re -initiation of investigational product. If 
hemoglobin levels decrease >3 g/dL again, investigational product should be discontinued and the subject should continue with all other study procedures.  
 Hemoglobin should continue to be monitored until it returns to a level of no less than 1.0 g/dL  
below baseline.  
 
Renal 
 
Renal function and potential nephrotoxicity will be assessed via hematology and urinalysis throughout the study.  If, at any visit, a creatinine increase of > 0.3 mg /dL (27 μmol/L) from 
baseline or a > 30 urinary albumin:creatinine ratio mg/g is observed, a repeat chemistry/urinalysis will be performed within 1 week. The patient’s past medical history, concomitant medications (including over the counter drugs and herb al supplements), and any recent symptoms (e.g., fatigue, 
malaise, polyuria/oliguria, or palpitations) will be reviewed to determine a potential etiology and make a clinical assessment of the significance of the finding.  
 Patients with persistent serum cre atinine changes of > 0.3 to < 0.5 mg/dL will be evaluated by the 
investigator to determine if the subject has any signs and symptoms of renal injury. If the investigator determines that the biomarkers along with the signs and symptoms are consistent with renal injury then investigational product should be discontinued and the subject should continue 
with all future protocol assessments.  
 If, at any visit, there is a creatinine increase ≥ 0.5 mg/dL from baseline and > ULN, a repeat 
chemistry will be performed  within one week. The subject’s pase medical history, concomitant 
medications (including over the counter drugs and herbal supplements0, and any recent symptoms (e.g. fatigue, malaise, polyuria/oliguria, or palpitations) will be reviewed to determine a pot ential 
etiology and make a clinical assessment of the significance of the finding. Clinically significant abnormal laboratory values occurring during the clinical study will be followed until repeat tests return to baseline or normal levels.

Version 2. 4, 9/11/ 2019  68 If at any ti me there is a doubling of serum creatinine or a decrease >50% in GFR from baseline, 
then investigational product should be discontinued immediately. The patient will be followed 
until renal parameters return to baseline or normal levels. The investigator c an determine based on 
signs, symptoms and laboratory data whether or not to reinitiate investigational product and 
continue with scheduled monitoring. Regardless of whether or not investigational product is reinitiated subjects should continue with all fut ure protocol assessments.  
 
 Muscle Injury  
Muscle injury  will be assessed using a combination of clinical signs and symptoms and la boratory 
data ( creatine kinase [ CK], hepatic, and renal function). 
All patient s with suspected or confirmed muscle injury should be managed according to the 
standard of care at the discretion of the Investigator. 
• Patient s with new or unexplained muscle symptoms should have an unscheduled visit 
scheduled within 7 days of site notification. At this visit, samples should be sent  for a full 
chemistry panel, including CK, liver, and renal function. 
• Patient s with CK elevations of >3 × upper limit of normal (ULN) who are asymptomatic should 
be considered for an unscheduled visit  (+ isozyme s), based upon medical judgment.  
• All patient s with CK elevations >10 ×  ULN should have an unscheduled visit  (+ isozymes)  
within 1 week. Study drug should be temporarily discontinued, pending the results of an 
investigation into the cause of muscle injury and/or CK elevation returns to within normal  
range or to a level deemed acceptable by the Investigator, or until the abnormality is  explained 
by an appropriate diagnosis. Any statin the patient is currently taking will be temporarily discontinued while the cause of the muscle injury is being investiga ted. The investigator can 
determine if it is appropriate to  reinitiate study drug. If study drug is reinitiated, then CK 
assessments should be made with 7 days to ensure that recurrence is not seen. If there is 
recurrent elevations >5 x ULN after  reinitiating study drug, then study drug should be 
permanently discontinued and the patient’s  CK and renal function followed until they return 
within normal range or to a level deemed  acceptable by the Investigator, or until the 
abnormality is explained by an appropriate diagnosis. If study drug is permanently 
discontinued the subject should continue with all  future protocol assessments. 
It is important that patient s are instructed to not undertake any form of strenuous physical activity 
for at least 24 hours prior to repeat blood testing.  
 Hepatic Monitoring: Subjects with baseline transaminases < 2x ULN  
 Subjects with hepatic enzyme elevations should be managed according to the standard of care, at  
the discretion of the Investigator. For subjects with signs or symptoms suggestive of hepatitis, an  
unscheduled visit and a chemistry panel should be performed. Subjects with an ALT or AST > 3  
× ULN should have an unscheduled visit. A repeat assessment should be performed as soon as possible (within 1 week) to confirm the  finding. A clinical evaluation should be performed,

Version 2. 4, 9/11/ 2019  69 including assessment of past medical history (including non -alcoholic fatty liver 
disease/steatohepatitis and alcohol use) and concomitant medications (including over the counter  
drugs and herbal supplements). Risk factors for hepatitis infection should be reviewed and hepatitis 
studies should be performed. Non- study drug potential causes for transaminase elevations should 
be ruled out. The investigator may consider to temporarily suspend study drug and reassess liver function weekly until they return within normal range or to a level deemed acceptable by the Investigator, or until the abnormality is explained by an appropriate diagnosis.  The possible dosing re -initiation (re -chall enge) or follow -up schedule for any events meeting these 
criteria will be determined by the Investigator in consultation with the Medical Monitor.  
 
Recommended Hepatic Discontinuation Criteria: Baseline Transaminase < 2x ULN  
 
Study drug should be discontinued permanently if any one of the following occurs (as confirmed by repeat assessment) and if the event is without an alternative explanation:  
• ALT or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) > 8 × ULN;  
• ALT or AST > 5 × ULN for more than 2 weeks;  
• ALT or AS T > 3 × ULN and either total bilirubin > 2 × ULN or international normalized ratio 
> 1.5; and/or  
• ALT or AST > 3 × ULN with the appearance of fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper quadrant 
pain or tenderness, fever, rash, and/or eosinophilia (> 5%).  
It is also recommended that statin regimen is discontinued if any of the above criteria is met. 
Abnormal values should be followed until they return within normal range or baseline range or to 
a level deemed acceptable by the Investigator, or until the abnormali ty is explained by an 
appropriate diagnosis. If study drug is permanently discontinued the subject should continue with 
all future protocol assessments.  
Hepatic Monitoring: Subjects with baseline transaminases ≥ 2x ULN  
 
If subjects with abnormal baseline liver indices develop elevations of AST or ALT >2x baseline 
or total bilirubin >1.5x baseline values during the study, repeat testing should be performed within 48 -72 hours. If there are persistent elevations (ALT or AST >2x baseline or TBL >1.5x baseline  
values) upon repeat testing, then close observation (testing and physical examination 2- 3 times per 
week) should be implemented and discontinuation of drug should be considered. Recommended Hepatic Discontinuation Criteria: Baseline Transaminase ≥ 2x ULN Study drug should be 
discontinued permanently if any one of the following occurs (as confirmed by repeat assessment) and if the event is without an alternative explanation:  
• If BLM ≥2x ULN but <5x ULN, discontinue if ALT or AST increases to >3x BLM  
• Disconti nue if ALT or AST increase is >2x BLM AND the increase is accompanied by a 
concomitant increase in TBL to >2x BLM OR the INR concomitantly increases by >0.2  
• In any subjects with signs and symptoms of fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper quadrant  
pain or tenderness, fever, rash, and/or eosinophilia (> 5%).

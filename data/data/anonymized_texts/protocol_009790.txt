3   78 Introduction 79  80 The augmentation of deficient attention abilities is especially of interest for older adults, given well 81 documented age-related declines in these abilities1-9, which are exacerbated in the presence of 82 interference2,10-13. Over the last decade there has been a surge of research aimed at improving cognitive 83 abilities by harnessing neuroplasticity via cognitive training13-17. Cognitive training as a whole has come under 84 warranted scrutiny given consistent shortcomings in study design and outcomes: i) minimal extension of 85 benefits beyond the training interventions themselves, ii) lack of appropriate control groups, and iii) absence 86 of follow-up testing to assess sustainability of observed effects18-20.  However, there have been several notable 87 examples of cognitive interventions enhancing non-trained cognitive abilities in older adults5,21-23, with these 88 findings aligning with systemic reviews supporting the utility of cognitive interventions in the older adult 89 population24-26.  90  In contrast to the uncertainty surrounding the benefits of cognitive training, the utility of physical fitness 91 interventions for older adults’ general health has been well established. Fitness-based interventions have also been 92 shown to benefit cognitive control abilities27-32, with such findings hinting at the possibility that combining cognitive and 93 physical training approaches may lead to greater cognitive benefits than either approach alone (although not supported 94 to date33-36). The use of combined cognitive and physical interventions are especially compelling as a strategy to 95 maintain both cognitive and physical health37-39, given that such a pairing can be a time- and resource-effective approach 96 for addressing multiple risk factors in older adults. Indeed, combined training has been shown to result in greater 97 participant enjoyment compared to either sequential training40 or physical exercise alone41. However, while the typical 98 protocol of alternating between physical and cognitive training has shown to have some cognitive benefits34,35,41-43, this 99 cumbersome tactic requires a multitude of human and material resources. Alternatively, one resource-effective 100 approach in this arena has been the use of exergames; however, it remains unclear how effective such approaches are 101 at improving cognitive and physical outcomes in aging populations44-49, leaving an open question of their overall utility. 102 We have previously demonstrated that cognitive interventions using closed-loop, adaptive algorithms50 103 designed to target specific cognitive abilities in older adults can improve task performance and neural measures of 104 cognition12,23,51-53, with some evidence of these effects persisting well after the intervention period51,54. These 105 interventions, delivered as engaging video games, have shown positive effects not only with older adults, but in diverse 106 populations55-58, with previous work highlighting the possibility of returning performance on measures of cognitive 107 control to young adult level.5,51  Here we created a novel exergame intervention for older adults (Body-Brain Trainer, 108 BBT; Figure 1) that requires participants to perform full-body, physical movements in response to cognitive challenges 109 that engage different cognitive control domains50,59. As in our previous work51,60,61, we integrated real-time adaptivity 110 using closed loop mechanics for each cognitive ability being challenged. Given the movement demands of BBT, we also 111 
4  implemented an adaptive physical fitness challenge by using real-time heart rate data to titrate game play for a 112 personalized and integrated training experience across both cognitive and physical domains (see Methods and 113 Supplementary Materials for more details on the BBT software).  114  In the present study, we sought to evaluate the primary question of whether BBT could improve measures of 115 attention and physical fitness in older adults beyond that of an expectancy-matched, active placebo control group. To 116 the best of our knowledge, this design is noteworthy given that the use of expectancy matching62 has been absent in all 117 previous efforts examining cognitive benefits from combined approaches, including those studies designed to evidence 118 potential synergistic effects through mechanistic control groups (see Supplemental Materials for a brief treatise 119 describing our rationale for utilizing this particular control group). We also interrogated the following secondary 120 questions: what is the neural mechanism underlying positive cognitive effects, do any observed cognitive improvements 121 persist one year later without booster training sessions, does BBT result in older adults achieving comparable levels to 122 young adults on our primary outcome measure, and does this intervention affect other measures of cognitive control 123 (working memory).  124  125 METHODS 126 Participants:  127 The study was approved by the Committee on Human Research at the University of California, San Francisco, and 128 retrospectively registered on ISRCTN registry [ISRCTN [66423499] to distinguish the goals and approach taken here from 129 those of the ‘parent’ registration (clinicaltrials.gov submission [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]). This study was designed to gauge the 130 feasibility and potential efficacy of using the BBT intervention compared to an expectancy matched active placebo 131 group, for a subsequent mechanistic trial exploring synergistic effects of a combined intervention versus individual 132 components alone (as described in the ‘parent’ clinicaltrials.gov submission). For continuity and cohesion, we used the 133 same primary (CPT) and secondary (Working Memory Task) outcome measures listed in the parent clinicaltrials.gov 134 registration. Furthermore, here we also examined a subset of the exploratory outcomes listed in the parent registration 135 (blood pressure, event-related spectral perturbation derived from EEG) as well as two new exploratory measures (Filter 136 Task, Limit of Stability Assessment). 49 healthy, older adult (OA) individuals consented to participate in this study. OAs 137 were randomly assigned (block size of 5) to a training group (body-brain trainer; BBT; N=24, mean age=68.8 +/- 5.9, 13 138 females) or an active, expectancy-matched control group (mind-body trainer; MBT; N=25, mean age=68.20 +/- 6.75, 13 139 females). All participants were from the San Francisco Bay Area and recruited through online and newspaper 140 advertisements. All participants had normal or corrected-to-normal vision, had no history of stroke, traumatic brain 141 injury, or psychiatric illness, were not taking psychotropic, hormonal, or cardiovascular medications, and did not have 142 any physical or mental conditions that may interfere with their daily activities (e.g., migraine headaches, substance 143 abuse, neuropathy. Similar to our previous work, all participants reported playing less than 2-hours of video games per 144 month, and completed a general health questionnaire reviewed by the study team assessing each individual’s current 145 
5  state of physical fitness to ensure that they could safely engage with the physical aspects of the BBT platform. All 146 participants gave written informed consent, and were paid $15/hour for their in-lab and at-home participation. All 147 participants were encouraged to not change any aspects of their daily routine (e.g. to change exercise habits) for the 148 duration of the study. 149  150 Neuropsychological Battery  151 Prior to experimental testing, all participants were evaluated on 3 measures probing for cognitive impairments and 152 depression (the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA110; minimum score of 26; the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS)111; 153 the PHQ-9112) as well as nine neuropsychological tests. These nine tests were subdivided into related domains and 154 composite scores of each were calculated for each of the following:  155 1. Immediate Memory – consisted of the five immediate recall trials from the California Verbal Learning Test 156 (CVLT-II) 113 157 2. Delayed Memory – the long delay free and cued recall trials as well as the Recognition measure from the CVLT-II 158 3. Processing Speed – Digit Symbol task (citation), Executive Composite-DKEFS Trails Condition 2 (numbers only) 114 159 4. Cognitive Flexibility (Task Switching) – DKEFS Trails Condition 4 (number-letter switch) 160 5. Fluency - Verbal Fluency (Animals 115, D- Words (MoCA)   161   162 Color vision deficiency was assessed with Ishihara’s Tests for Colour Deficiency116. To be included in the study, all 163 individuals were required to be within 2 standard deviations (SD) of age-matched controls on all five of the composite 164 scores. Participants were also excluded if two or more composite scores exceeded 1.5 SDs. This procedure provided a 165 thorough characterization of the cognitive status of each OA participant in multiple domains while simultaneously 166 ensuring that their cognitive faculties were comparable to that of their age-matched peers. All participants tested within 167 two SDs of the normative values established for each of these measures.   168   169 Study Design:  170 For those participants randomized to the BBT group, they were asked to come to Neuroscape at UCSF 3 days per week, 1 171 hour per visit (36min of on-task training time per session, 24 minutes allocated for warm up/cool down/breaks) for 8 172 weeks (24 hours total, 14.4 hours of actual training time). Each of these visits were accompanied by an onsite trainer to 173 facilitate the training experience for the participant and ensure that training was being completed in a safe manner. For 174 those participants randomized to the MBT group, they were loaned an iPad tablet (9.7 inch screen size; 1024 x 768 175 screen resolution) for their training session following their ‘Pre-training’ assessment, and were instructed to train with 176 their assigned task at home for six weeks, 5-days per week, with 30-minute training sessions per day, for a maximum of 177 thirty 30-minute training sessions (15 hours of training total). All MBT participants were instructed to train sitting down 178 with the tablet on a flat surface, such as a table, in a location with minimal external distraction.   179 
6   We used a study design that involved several layers of blinding: i) data was collected by a group of research 180 associates who were blinded to the identity of the intervention group, ii) data analysis (which was anonymized to 181 conceal intervention group identity) was performed by a different group of researchers, and iii) participants were 182 blinded to the group assignment following randomization procedure, which was done prior to the first participant visit 183 to the lab. Blinding began at the point of recruitment, where all participants were informed that they were being 184 recruited for a study designed to test the efficacy of software interventions for improving cognition in a variety of 185 domains. Neither the BBT nor the MBT participants were aware of the other group or the task that they trained with. 186 Both groups were administered the same instructions and brief overview of the goals of the study, namely to determine 187 if the training game could improve cognitive abilities. Thus, all participants were told that they were part of an active 188 intervention to improve their cognitive abilities (see below for details on how we established matched expectancy117). 189 Finally, one study coordinator was informed of the treatment assignments, as their role was solely to provide technical 190 and other support during the training.  191  All participants reported to our UCSF Neuroscape laboratories prior to training (‘Pre-training’ session) and 192 following the completion (‘Post-training’ session) of training (1-week grace period from start/end of training) to compete 193 a battery of cognitive and physical outcome measures to assess training-related changes. Participants were invited to 194 return to the laboratory 1 year after their post-training outcome assessment to evidence which, if any, positive training 195 effects persisted in the cognitive domain.  Over the course of the study, 3 participants in the BBT group and 2 196 participants in the MBT group voluntarily withdrew from the study, resulting in the complete pre- and post-training data 197 sets from 24 BBT participants and 25 MBT participants. One additional participant had a non-training related adverse 198 event which caused them to withdraw from the study prior to be randomized to a group. We were unable to collect EEG 199 data from three participants at pre-training due to equipment malfunctions, and, due to technical issues with 200 photodiodes, we were unable to time-lock the EEG to the event onsets for several other participants (n= 4 at pre-201 training, n= 4 at post-training). There was one participant who did not return for their post physical assessment. 202  203 Intervention Descriptions: 204 BBT paradigm:  BBT is comprised of three modules, with each targeting a different aspect of cognitive control: visual 205 search tasks for attention (with increasing distraction), spatial span/multiple object tracking tasks for working memory, 206 and a task-switching paradigm targeting goal management/cognitive flexibility abilities. There are also three different 207 tasks with ascending difficulty within each module, such that advancing to the next level engages a fresh challenge while 208 maintaining interest (for example, a change from a spatial span condition to a multiple object tracking condition with 209 working memory demands). Comparable to our previous work using cognitive measures alone51,60,61, here we integrate 210 real-time adaptivity for both the cognitive and physical aspects of the gameplay. For each cognitive task, difficulty scales 211 on a trial-by-trial basis, with a correct trial performed within a thresholding-determined response window leading to 212 shorter response window by 10msec, and an incorrect trial leading to a lengthening of the response window by 30msec 213 
7  (thus, a 1”up”/3”down” staircase). These cognitive adaptive algorithms are designed to assure participants remain at an 214 ~80% rate of accuracy, a level that is not too easy nor too hard, so that it is enjoyable and engaging. For the physical 215 training, difficulty is tied to the demands associated with the distance an individual must travel for a given response and 216 the amount of time allocated to complete this response. These movement-related aspects are directly responsive to 217 whether heart rate is below/within/above a predetermined heart rate window to ensure a moderately intense workout 218 that does not impede the ability to perform the cognitive task. For example, if one is playing the game below their 219 assigned heart rate range, the software will automatically increase the distance that the participant must move to 220 respond with their hands/feet on each trial until their heart rate is within the specified range. Training sessions are 221 linked, such that the next session begins at the level attained at the end of the previous session. Participants are 222 provided two types of feedback: 1) real-time feedback – indicating whether the participant successfully detected or 223 classified the target and 2) punctuated feedback – participants advance through a series of “levels” that are reported at 224 the beginning and end of each run.  225  226 BBT Module Descriptions 227 (i) BBT Attention. This module demands an active scan of the screen in search of a target, much like traditional visual 228 search tasks118. This module involves a constantly evolving amount of cued information as well as number of 229 incongruent distracting elements, such that participants experience less cued information while experiencing more and 230 more distracting elements as they advance. Participants are required to quickly identify the direction of a probe target 231 that is facing at a right angle (up, down, left, right), and are aided by the presence of directional cue indicating in which 232 location of the screen the target will appear amongst distracting elements. Responses are made by reaching their hands 233 to indicate the direction of the probe, with the additional physical challenge of running in place if the target is up or 234 down. Prior to each level, participants completed a thresholding session to determine the optimal starting point from 235 both a cognitive and physical perspective. After completing their initial 7 training sessions, participants advance to LEVEL 236 2 of this module which entailed facing a greater challenge: here they encountered an increase in the number and 237 salience of distracting elements, including the presence of congruent distractors, as based on their performance on the 238 previous trial. After completing 14 training sessions, participants moved on to LEVEL 3 of this module: here participants 239 performed the same task as before, but now without the aid of a directional cue. Participants only receive game points 240 when they correctly perform a given trial faster than the predetermined, personalized threshold determined at the 241 beginning of each level to optimize the attentional engagement.  242  243 (ii) BBT Working Memory. This module engages spatial working memory resources similar to the Corsi block task119-121, 244 requiring individuals to memorize an additional stimulus following two consecutive correct responses, with two 245 consecutive incorrect trials leading to one element being subtracted. Participants memorize the location of objects on 246 screen followed by a 5-7 second delay period during which the participants perform a directed physical movement, with 247 
8  a correct response leading to a greater number of potential targets to be memorized on the next trial (and vice versa). 248 Responses are made with both hands and feet by reaching/kicking targets, with additional physical challenges (making a 249 woodchopping motion) occurring during the delay period. Prior to each level, participants completed a thresholding 250 session to determine the optimal starting point from both a cognitive and physical perspective. After completing 7 251 training sessions, participants are asked to also memorize and report the sequential order in which the targets originally 252 appeared on the screen (LEVEL 2), thus increasing the spatial working memory load. After 14 training sessions, 253 participants perform a working memory/multiple object tracking task that requires memorizing and tracking the targets 254 as they become invisible and move amongst a sea of moving objects (LEVEL 3).  Participants receive game points when 255 they correctly complete a working memory trial faster than a predetermined, personalized threshold so as to challenge 256 the underlying cognitive working memory circuitry. 257  258 (iii) BBT Task Switching. This module challenges cognitive flexibility resources by requiring participants to rapidly switch 259 their focus based on distinct rules, much like a traditional task-switching paradigm122-124. Here a morphing algorithm is 260 used to titrate the perceptual similarity of the target presented, such that a correct trial makes a subsequent exemplar 261 morph more similar to the probe presented (and vice versa). Participants are presented with exemplar objects along 262 with a target, and move their hands to the target object that is most similar to the exemplar presented. For example, 263 when a greenish-blue target appears, participants decide whether the image is more GREEN or more BLUE. The target 264 changes its degree of likeness to each exemplar following each trial, with each correct response morphing the probe 265 towards an indistinguishable 50/50 ratio of each exemplar (and vice versa). Prior to each level, participants completed a 266 thresholding session to determine the optimal starting point from both a cognitive and physical perspective. After 267 completing 7 training sessions, the presented probes now have features that integrate two rule bases (Level 2, e.g. both 268 Color and Shape, so a BLUE square), creating greater cognitive demands, similar to interference generated by a Stroop 269 task. Finally, after 14 training sessions, participants perform the same task, but the exemplars now spawn in random 270 locations across the screen, heightening the cognitive demands further by requiring visual search (LEVEL 3). Participants 271 receive game points when they perform a trial as fast or faster than a predetermined, personalized threshold to 272 pressure underlying goal-management circuitry. 273  274 BBT cognitive and physical training calibration 275 For each cognitive task, difficulty was initially determined through a pre-training assessment to determine an optimal 276 training threshold, then scaled on a trial-by-trial basis throughout the training experience. The associated physical 277 challenge for each cognitive task was driven via motion capture of one’s hands and feet, where the distance that an 278 individual had to reach/kick to respond during the cognitive task was directly tied to a participant’s predetermined 279 optimal training heart rate. For example, if an individual’s heart rate was below their training window, then the distance 280 an individual had to traverse to respond on a given trial increased.  281 
9   282 This continuous cognitive scaling occurred in parallel with an adaptive cardiovascular challenge, with a pre-283 training VO2 max assessment determining an optimal training window with respect to one’s heart rate using 284 indirect calorimetry125 to calculate a more precise level of cardiovascular fitness for each individual. More 285 specifically, this involved participants completing a treadmill graded exercise VO2 Max test to subsequently 286 determine an individual’s maximal heart rate, which subsequently was used to determine the heart rate 287 percentiles (60-70% of one’s max HR, 70-80% of one’s max HR, etc.) at which participants would train at during 288 the BBT training experience. This predetermined heart rate window was used as a baseline comparator against 289 one’s current heart rate, with the responses needed for a given cognitive task scaled to be closer or further 290 away than a previous trial without impeding the ability to perform the cognitive task.  291  292 MBT battery: 293  To mitigate any potential placebo effects brought on by participant expectations, we identified a suitable active 294 control condition based on participant predictions of potential training-related gains as in our previous work58. 295 We identified a set of three commercially available iOS apps (Supplementary Figure 1) that were matched to 296 our BBT program in terms of expectation of improvement on our cognitive outcome measures (see below for 297 description of the statistical selection process).  Those apps were a language learning app (Duolingo; 298 www.duolingo.com), a Tai Chi app (Tai Chi Step by Step; www.imoblife.net), and a logic games app (100 Logic 299 Games; www.andreasabbatini.com/LogicGames.aspx). For Duolingo, participants were given a choice of which 300 language they wanted to learn from those available on the app. Within the app, we set a 10 min training time 301 per day. During training, the app takes users through a series of modules that increase in difficulty and are only 302 unlocked sequentially following completion of an earlier module. Modules are organized topically (e.g., Food, 303 Animals, Phrases, etc.) and each module contains listening, speaking, vocabulary, and translation tasks and 304 culminates with a topic quiz. At the end of each lesson the app provides a progress report showing learning 305 “streaks” and the accumulation of “lingots” (Duolingo currency). These feedback features are meant to keep 306 participants motivated. For Tai Chi, users simply open the app and select from a series of modules that provide 307 detailed and easy-to-follow instructions on how to perform many basic, intermediate, and advanced Tai Chi 308 movements and is geared toward beginners with no Tai Chi experience. Each description can be read or listened 309 to and is accompanied by an animation. Users were instructed to then practice the exercise themselves several 310 times after each lesson. The logic games app is comprised of a series of “puzzle sets” that revolve around a 311 particular theme and which get progressively more difficult as people advance. The puzzles are similar to the 312 
10  more well-known Sudoku puzzles, but provide a more engaging experience with colorful icons, unique rule sets 313 for each theme, and increasing difficulty. For each puzzle, users are given a task (e.g., plant trees according to 314 specific rules), a time limit, and several hints that they can unlock. Participants were instructed to spend 315 approximately 10 min with each app each training day (5 days per week for 6 weeks). For Duolingo, the time 316 was set internally in the app. For the other two apps, participants self-timed their training, and they recorded 317 their time on a training log. All participants completed the MBT intervention at home using an iPad Mini 2 (iOS 318 version 8.2; Apple) that was supplied by the UCSF Neuroscape Center. On the day they were given their iPad to 319 begin training, participants were also provided an instructional binder with instructions on how to play, a 320 calendar for recording notes and comments throughout their training experience, and were given e-mail support 321 throughout the intervention period. Throughout the intervention period, technical support for the iPads and all 322 software was provided via e-mail, phone, and in-person contact, when needed. 323  324 Because these apps were commercial apps and not designed to send data to our server, we took additional 325 steps to track compliance in the MBT group. On the day they were given their iPad to begin training, participants 326 were also provided an instructional binder with instructions on how to play, a calendar for recording notes and 327 comments throughout their training experience, and were given e-mail support throughout the treatment 328 period. They were instructed to try to split their time equally among the three apps. Upon completion of the 329 training, researchers confirmed the participants’ logged training times. 330  331 Behavioral Cognitive Control Assessments:   332 Attention without distraction. A custom continuous performance task (CPT) designed in Presentation 333 (http://neurobs.com) was used to assess vigilance without distraction. This tool is a modified version of a well-334 validated vigilance task (Figure 2a), the Test of Variables of Attention (TOVA), that we have used as an outcome 335 measure in previous intervention studies. As our metric of interest, we focused on the ex-gaussian tau of 336 response times, a non-parametric measure of distribution skewing that quantifies attentional lapses by 337 examining the distribution of long response times. Several studies have demonstrated a clear advantage of this 338 measure over traditional measures of response time (although we report on traditional metrics of response 339 time and response time variance in the Supplemental Materials) given that it explains a greater proportion of 340 variance without needing to employ data trimming techniques126-128. Importantly, this measure has been shown 341 to reflect performance inconsistencies that are especially present in both healthy older adults and those with 342 
11  mild cognitive impairment129, and has been used to support neural noise130 and dedifferentiation131-133 theories 343 of cognitive aging. 344 For the present study, we adapted the task for use with EEG recordings, which requires many trials with 345 an actual response, and also facilitates the examination of ex-gaussian tau, a non-parametric measure of 346 distribution skewing of response times134-137. In this task, participants maintain fixation on a central crosshairs 347 and grey squares are shown on a black background at the top or bottom of the field of view. Stimuli are 348 presented frequently at the top of the screen as a 4:1 ratio of targets to nontargets and participants are 349 instructed to only respond to these stimuli. Participants completed 2 blocks of 125 trials with 100 targets per 350 block, yielding 200 total targets and 50 non-target trials.  351  352 Working memory fidelity task.  We used a delayed recognition working memory paradigm designed to measure changes 353 in participants’ ability to maintain an accurate mental representation of items in working memory either in presence or 354 absence of distracting or interfering information. We have used versions of this task in numerous previous 355 studies11,51,56,78. To summarize briefly, this paradigm consisted of three different conditions that were presented in 356 blocks: 1) no distraction (ND), 2) Ignore distractor (ID, distractor was present, but participants were informed that the 357 distractor was to be ignored), and 3) Attend Distractor (AD, participants were required to make a judgment about the 358 interfering stimulus). Each run was preceded by an instruction slide informing the participant which condition they 359 would be performing. Each trial began with the presentation of a face displayed for 800 ms, followed by a delay period 360 (3 s), the presentation of a face stimulus as a distractor in the ID and AD conditions (800 ms), a second delay period (3 s), 361 and the presentation of a face probe (1 s). The participants were instructed to make a match/nonmatch button press 362 response at the probe as quickly as possible, without sacrificing accuracy. This was followed by a self-paced intertrial 363 interval (ITI). The experiment was programmed in E-Prime (https://pstnet.com/products/e-prime/) and the stimuli were 364 presented on a CRT monitor.  365  366 Basic response time task. Here we administered a basic response time (BRT) task as a measure of simple motoric 367 response time to ensure that any differences observed between groups were not due to differences in basic motoric 368 quickness. Basic motor speed was assessed in the form of a simple target-detection task during their pre-training 369 assessment, to ensure that any training-related enhancements in performance were not attributed to a general motoric 370 speed increase, but rather to enhancements in cognitive control processes. On this task participants pressed a keyboard 371 button as quickly as possible upon the appearance of a circle at the center of the screen (50 trials). Average response 372 time (the time between the target appearance and button press) was assayed as a unit of basic motor speed 138.  373  374 
12  Complex visual discrimination amid distractions. For this exploratory measure of attention in the presence of variable 375 distraction (considered exploratory given that it was not described in the parent clinicaltrial.gov submission), we used a 376 custom Filter Task139 (Supplemental Figure 7a) to assess how well participants were able to identify targets in the 377 presence of task-irrelevant information58,140,141. The experiment was programmed in MATLAB’s psychophysics toolbox 378 (http://psychtoolbox.org/) and the stimuli were presented on a CRT monitor. In this task, participants must attend to an 379 array of different numbers of items (either 1 or 3 red rectangles) with or without the presence of 2 visual distractors (2 380 blue or green rectangles): set size 1 no distractors (1 total item), set size 1 with distractors (3 total items), set size 3 no 381 distractors (3 total items), set size 3 with distractors (5 total items). Half of each of the trials for each condition began 382 with a cue indicating the participant should attend to either the left or the right side of the screen. The procedure for 383 each trial began with a 750 ms fixation cross following by a right/left cue (200ms) and then a 300 ms blank ISI. Next, a 384 sample set from one of the four conditions was shown for 200ms followed by a 900 ms blank delay and then a probe set 385 containing the same number of red rectangles as in the sample in either the same orientation or with a single rectangle 386 of altered orientation (50% of each). The probe screen remained visible until participants responded with a “Yes” or 387 “No” button press indicating whether or not one of the attended rectangles changed orientation. Participants 388 completed 8 blocks of 80 trials, yielding 160 trials per condition. Participants were instructed to respond as fast as 389 possible without sacrificing accuracy. As in our previous work58, we focused on Response Time Variability (RTV) as our 390 measure of interest here. 391  392   393 Neural Cognitive Control Assessments:   394 EEG Recordings. Neurophysiological data were recorded during each cognitive control assessment using an 395 active two head cap (Cortech Solutions) with a BioSemiActiveTwo 64-channel EEG acquisition system in 396 conjunction with BioSemiActiView software (Cortech Solutions). Signals were amplified and digitized at 1024 Hz 397 with a 16-bit resolution. Anti-aliasing filters were used and data were band-pass filtered between 0.01–100 Hz 398 during data acquisition. For each EEG recording session, a 1 × 1-inch white box was flashed for 10 ms at one of 399 the corners on the stimulus presentation monitor at the start of each trial. A photodiode 400 (http://www.gtec.at/Products/Hardware-and-Accessories/g.TRIGbox-Specs-Features) captured this change in 401 luminance to facilitate precise time-locking of the neural activity associated with each sign event. During the 402 experiment, these corners were covered with tape to prevent participants from being distracted by the flashing 403 light. 404  405 EEG Preprocessing. Preprocessing was conducted using the EEGLAB software142. Noisy channels were identified 406 upon initial visual inspection, were removed from the data, and interpolated using a spherical spline 407 
13  interpolation, using the average signal of the surrounding channels to reconstruct the data in the removed 408 channel. The data were then down-sampled to 1024 Hz to reduce the computational demand without losing 409 any important information in the data. A finite impulse response filter with a high-pass cutoff of 1 Hz was applied 410 to remove drift, and then a low-pass filter at 40 Hz was applied to remove high frequency noise. Ocular 411 correction was performed by using ICA to isolate and remove activity induced by eye-blinks and lateral eye 412 movements from the signal. The data were then re-referenced to the average signal of all channels. Epochs of -413 1000 ms to +1000 ms were generated for each stimulus type for subsequent analyses. Epochs containing 414 excessive peak-to-peak deflections (±100 µV) were removed.  415  416 Midline Frontal Theta Analyses. Midline frontal theta (4-7Hz) power (mft Power) has been implicated in 417 sustained attention abilities 51,143-145, including correlating with RTV across the lifespan146, that can evidence the 418 engagement of the prefrontal cognitive control processes during a given task. This particular marker has also 419 demonstrated a level of sensitivity in revealing changes following a digital intervention in multiple 420 studies23,51,54,55,58. Time series were created by resolving 4-40 Hz activity using a fast Fourier transform (FFT) in 421 EEGLAB in epochs from -1000 to +1000msec. Midline frontal theta total power analyses (evoked power + 422 induced power) across trials from the vigilance task was conducted by resolving 4–40 Hz activity using a fast 423 Fourier transform in EEGLAB, with these values subsequently referenced to a -900 to -700 pre-stimulus baseline 424 (thus relative power (dB)). After mft relative power was computed, we specifically interrogated a predetermined 425 cluster of frontal electrodes (Fz, FPz, AF3, AF4, and AFz) at the time window of maximum power, as this is the 426 same approach that we have previously utilized in several intervention studies interrogating mft power 427 changes51,54,55,58.  428  429 Physical outcome measures:  430 To capture changes in physical fitness due to training during the study, all participants underwent a 431 comprehensive physical outcomes assessment in addition to the cognitive assessments described above. Our 432 targeted outcome measures were a senior-specific measure of stability indicative of fall risk76,77 as well as a 433 physiological measure of fitness and health (diastolic blood pressure)74. Our decision to focus on diastolic (rather 434 than systolic) blood pressure was based on diastolic blood pressure being a proportionally larger contributor to 435 mean arterial pressure (MAP)147, with MAP being an important predictor of cardiovascular disease148-150. 436 Descriptions of each exploratory fitness measure evaluated, including systolic blood pressure, are described in 437 
14  the Supplemental Materials; note that these measures  came from the Senior Fitness Test (SFT) to assess global 438 physical performance151.  439  440 Training-related expectancy ratings:  441 In an effort to identify an expectancy matched placebo versus the BBT intervention, we first compared 442 expectancy on 10 different apps to BBT in a sample of 261 participants (Female=135, mean age=33.5). Each 443 participant was randomly assigned to view a video of BBT or one of 10 potential apps (n= 15–30 individuals 444 per app) which we did not hypothesize would improve cognitive abilities. They were then asked to rate the 445 extent to which the presented intervention would lead to improvements on these outcomes, using a Likert 446 scale measuring 1 (no improvement) to 7 (a lot of improvement). Following this first round of testing, we 447 selected the three apps that had the highest expectancy matching scores, and subsequently collected new 448 expectancy data in a sample of 76 young adults to assess the level of expectancy involving the combination of 449 these three apps (n=37) versus BBT (n=39). Here we found no differences in participant expectations of 450 improvement on our CPT task (t74= 0.24, P = 0.62, 95% CI: −1.3 to 0.77) or on our filter task (t74= 0.55, P = 0.16, 451 95% CI: −0.30 to 1.8), suggesting that we had comparable expectancy on this battery of control apps as 452 compared to the BBT intervention with respect to our cognitive control outcome measures.   453  To determine if these expectancy findings held with older adults, we had 91 older adults complete this same 454 expectancy survey. These older adults were shown a recording of either the BBT (n=46, mean age=64.4, Female=28) or 455 the MBT (n=45, mean age= 63.2, Female=31) interventions and subsequently shown a video describing our cognitive 456 outcome measures. We observed no significant difference between interventions in terms of participant expectations of 457 improvement on the CPT (independent t-test: t89 =-1.84, p=0.069, with the MBT intervention showing a trend towards 458 having greater expectation of improving on this measure than the BBT group) and the Filter tasks (independent t-test: t89 459 =-0.682, p=0.50). To ensure that these findings extended to the present study, we asked all BBT and MBT participants to 460 complete a comparable version of this survey after they had completed their first few days of training on their assigned 461 intervention to see if their experience led to different expectancy-based perceptions. This was motivated especially by 462 the fact that the MBT training experience was distinct from the BBT training experience in that they completed their 463 training at home on a tablet by themselves, whereas the BBT group trained at a laboratory on a large screen TV in the 464 presence of a trainer. Once again, we observed no significant difference between interventions in terms of participant 465 expectations of improvement on the CPT (independent t-test: t36 =1.26, p=0.21, MBT mean=5.0, BBT mean=5.4) and the 466 Filter tasks (independent t-test: t36 =0.64, p=0.53, MBT mean=5.0, BBT mean=5.3). 467  468

Protocol: ETC-1002-040 
2 Introduction Version 2.4, Mar 22, 2018 
Statistical Analysis Plan 
The purpose of this document is to describe the statistical methods, data derivations and 
data summaries to be employed in ETC-1002-040. The preparation of this statistical 
analysis plan (SAP) has been based on International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) 
E3 and E9 Guidelines and in reference to Protocol ETC-1002-040 (Protocol Amendment 
5, 10 May 2017). 
The SAP will supersede the protocol in the event of any differences between the two 
documents in the plans for data analysis, and the protocol will be amended if appropriate. 
The SAP will be included as an appendix in the clinical study report for this protocol. 
3 Study Objectives and Endpoints 
3.1 Objectives 
The primary objective for this study is to evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of 
ETC-1002 (bempedoic acid) versus placebo in high cardiovascular (CV) risk patients 
with hyperlipidemia (with underlying heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia 
[HeFH] and/or atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases [ASCVD]) who are not adequately 
controlled with their maximally tolerated lipid-modifying therapy. 
The secondary objective is to assess the efficacy as the percent change from baseline to 
Week 12 in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). This is the primary efficacy 
endpoint. 
The tertiary objectives are: 
• To assess percent change from baseline to Week 24 and to Week 52 in LDL-C in 
patients who do not receive adjunctive lipid lowering therapy. 
•To assess high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), non-HDL-C, total cholesterol 
(TC), and triglycerides (TG) values at Week 12, 24 and 52. 
• To assess apolipoprotein B (apoB) and high-sensitivity C reactive protein (hsCRP) 
values at Week 12, 24, and 52. 
3.2 Primary Safety Endpoints 
The primary safety endpoint for this study is general safety, which includes adverse 
events (AEs), clinical safety laboratories, physical examinations (PEs), vital signs, and 
electrocardiogram (ECGs). 
3.2.1 Adverse Events 
The evaluation of AEs will include only incidence of treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs), 
defmed as AEs that begin or worsen after the first dose of IMP until 30 days after last 
dose of IMP. Clinical endpoints will be collected and adjudicated by an independent

Statistical Analysis Plan 
Clinical Events Committee (CEC). Clinical endpoints will also be reported as SAEs. 
Adverse events of special interest (AESI) will further be examined (See Section 5.4.2 for 
more information). 
3.2.2 Clinical Safety Laboratories 
The evaluation of clinical safety laboratories, including blood hematology, chemistry, 
coagulation, and urinalysis, will be based on the observed values. Observed values and 
changes from baseline will be summarized for all post-baseline study visits. 
3.2.3 ECG, Vital Signs and PE 
The evaluation of ECG and vital signs (including heart rate, systolic blood pressure, 
diastolic blood pressure, weight, height [baseline only], and body mass index [BMI]), 
will be based on the observed values. For ECGs, shifts from baseline to end-of-study will 
be summarized. For vital signs, observed values and changes from baseline will be 
summarized for all post-baseline study visits. Listings of PE data will include only those 
records where the body system at the baseline PE was normal, but the body system at a 
post-baseline PE was marked as 'Change from previous exam, clinically significant.' 
3.3 Primary Efficacy Endpoints 
3.3.1 Primary Efficacy Endpoint 
Percent change from baseline to Week 12 in LDL-C 
3.3.2 Key Secondary Efficacy Endpoints 
1) percent change from baseline to Week 24 in LDL-C 
2) percent change from baseline to Week 12 in non-HDL-C 
3) percent change from baseline to Week 12 in TC 
4) percent change from baseline to Week 12 in apoB 
5) percent change from baseline to Week 12 in hsCRP 
3.3.3 Other Efficacy Endpoints 
Percent change or change in LDL-C, HDL-C, TGs, TC, non-HDL-C, hsCRP, and apoB 
values at other protocol-scheduled time points will also be evaluated as secondary 
efficacy endpoints (See Section 5.3 for more information) 
Proportion of patients achieving LDL-C < 70 mg/dL at week 12, 24 and 52 will be 
evaluated. 
3.4 Pharmacokinetic (PK) and Other Biomarkers 
Trough plasma concentrations will be collected at Weeks 12, 24, and 52 from patients 
randomized into the study prior to the implementation of Protocol Amendment 3 for use 
in further developing the population pharmacokinetic (PK) model. Trough plasma

concentrations will not be collected from patients randomized into the study after the 
implementation of Protocol Amendment 3 in the EU, Protocol Amendment 4 in the US. 
PK analysis will be based on PK concentration population using the actual treatment 
received. 
4 Study Design 
4.1 Study Design 
This is a Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study 
evaluating the long-term safety and tolerability ofETC-1002 in high cardiovascular (CV) 
risk patients with hyperlipidemia (patients with underlying HeFH and/or ASCVD) who 
are not adequately treated with their maximally tolerated lipid-modifying therapy. 
Maximally tolerated lipid-lowering therapy includes a maximally tolerated statin alone or 
in combination with other lipid-lowering therapies, in patients with hyperlipidemia. A 
patient's maximally tolerated lipid-modifying therapy will be determined by the 
investigator using their medical judgment and available sources, including the patient's 
self-reported history of lipid-modifying therapy. 
The study will be conducted at approximately 125 clinical sites in the United States, 
Canada, Germany, Netherlands, Poland, and United Kingdom. The study will end when 
the last randomized patient completes their last study visit (last patient last visit [LPL V] 
for last randomized patient). The estimated overall duration of the study (first patient first 
visit [FPFV] to LPL V) is approximately 28 months.

4.2 Study Treatments and Assessments 
Screening (Visit Sl) will occur approximately 2 weeks prior to Day 1 (Visit Tl). Patients 
on maximally tolerated lipid-lowering therapy, as determined by the investigator, will be 
stratified based on CV risk (HeFH and ASCVD diagnosis) and baseline statin dose 
category defined in Table 1, where baseline statin dose category is defined in Table 2. 
There will be no cap placed on randomization into any particular stratum. Patients will be 
placed in the baseline statin dose category based on their average daily statin dose (some 
patients do not take a daily statin; for those who do not, their baseline statin category will 
be based on the average daily statin dose rather than on the actual statin dose).

procedures. For details of study assessments, see Appendix 1: Schedule of Events 
(Patient Visit Schedule). 
An independent expert Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will formally review 
accumulating unblinded safety and efficacy data from this and other any ongoing studies 
of ETC-1002. All clinical cardiovascular endpoints, including all major cardiac events 
(MACE) and non-MACE endpoints defined as: CV death (MACE), non-CV death (non-
MACE), nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI) (MACE), nonfatal stroke (MACE), 
hospitalization for unstable angina (MACE), coronary revascularization (MACE), non-
coronary arterial revascularization (non-MACE), and hospitalization for heart failure 
(non-MACE), will be adjudicated by an independent blinded expert Clinical Events 
Committee (CEC), using standardized definitions. Any clinical endpoints that meet 
serious adverse event (SAE) criteria will be reported as SAEs. 
4.3 Randomization and Blinding 
For patients who satisfy all entry criteria and complete the 2-week screening period, 
randomization will occur and their randomization number will be assigned via IWRS at 
Week 0 (Visit Tl). Patients will be stratified on CV risk (HeFH and ASCVD diagnosis) 
and baseline statin dose and randomized in a ratio of 2:1 to receive 1 of the 2 following 
treatments in a double-blind fashion: 
• ETC-1002 180-mg tablet 
• Matching placebo tablet 
For details regarding the randomization strata see Table 1. 
The randomization code for treatment and IMP packaging will be generated by the 
Clinical Supply Chain (CSC) department following specifications from the Biostatistics 
Department. Patients will be randomly assigned to treatment and IMP packing through 
Interactive Web-based Response System (IWRS). This system is used to ensure a balance 
across treatment groups within each randomization stratum; no effort will be made to 
maintain a balance among treatment groups within an investigational center. 
4.4 Sample Size Justification 
A total of 1950 patients will be enrolled in this study with 1300 patients randomized to 
ETC 1002 and 650 patients randomized to placebo. Using an anticipated overall dropout 
rate of 7.5% at 6 months exposure and 10.0% at 12 months exposure in each treatment 
group, the expected number of patients exposed to treatment during the study is as 
follows: 
ETC-1002

Protocol: ETC-1002-040 Version 2.4, Mar 22, 2018 
Statistical Analysis Plan 
Absolute risk will be addressed by 1300 patients randomized to ETC-1002 and will 
provide at least 95% power to detect AEs that occur at rates similar to those seen in the 
placebo group for the AEs of interest in the recently completed long-term safety study 
entitled Efficacy and Safety of Alirocumab in Reducing Lipids and Cardiovascular 
Events [5]. In this study, adverse event rates ranged from 0.5% to 13.6%. Additional 
assumptions include a two-sided test with significance level at 0.05. 
When AEs occur at a range of rates similar to those seen in the placebo group in the 
above referenced alirocumab study (0.5% to 13.6%), the sample size of 1300 patients 
randomized to ETC 1002 and 650 patients randomized to placebo will allow for detection 
of relative risks of 1.0 and of 2.0 (ETC-1002: placebo) with the following approximate 
95% confidence limits: 
% Placebo Patients % ETC-1002 Patients Relative Approximate 95% 
Experiencing AE Experiencing AE Risk Confidence Interval 
0.5% 0.5% 1.0 (0.3, 3.8) 
0.5% 1.0% 2.0 (0.6, 6.7) 
13.6% 13.6% 1.0 (0.8, 1.3) 
13.6% 27.2% 2.0 (1.6, 2.5) 
4.5 Interim Analyses, Final Analyses and Unblinding 
No interim analysis is planned for this study. 
The fmal analysis will be performed after the database is locked, the treatment 
assignments are unblinded using the actual randomization, and the database released. 
An independent external Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) has been established for 
this study. Detailed information about the responsibilities and operation of the DMC were 
provided in the DMC Charter. 
4.6 Changes from Protocol Planned Analyses 
1) Additional subgroup analysis and sensitivity analyses are proposed and described 
in this SAP. 
2) It is clarified in the SAP that study objectives are supported by both primacy 
safety and primary efficacy endpoints. 
3) Multiplicity adjustment amongst efficacy endpoints is implemented and described 
in this SAP.

5 Statistical and Analytical Plans 
5.1 General Statistical Considerations Version 2.4, Mar 22, 2018 
Statistical Analysis Plan 
The ETC-1002 treatment group will be displayed in the tables, listings and figures (1LF s) 
as "bempedoic acid 180 mg." 
In general, all safety and PK data will be reported as observed. No imputation will be 
performed for missing data, except for the missing lipid efficacy data (Please refer to 
Section 5.3.2 for more details). Descriptive statistics (n, mean, standard deviation [SD], 
Ql, Q3, median, minimum, and maximum) will be calculated for continuous data. 
Minimum and maximum will be presented same number of decimal places as 
reported/collected, one additional decimal place for mean and median, and two additional 
decimal places for SD. 
Categorical data will be summarized using n and percentage based on number of non-
missing values. Percentage will be presented with one decimal place. The number of 
missing values will be presented as a separate category with no percentage, but only if 1 
or more patients are missing data for the summary. Otherwise, all categories will be 
presented (even if no patients are counted in the category). Counts of zero in any category 
will be presented without percentage. 
Data will be presented on listings in order of patient, assessment date and assessment (in 
order collected on CRF, unless specified otherwise). Dates will be presented in format 
DDMMMYYYY. 
Relative day calculations will be [date of interest -relative date + (date of interest>= 
relative date)]. This calculation will result in dates prior to the relative date being 
presented as negative days, and those occurring on or after the relative date as Day 1 or 
later, i.e., there will be no Day 0. 
Baseline for fasting lipid parameters including LDL-C, TC, HDL-C, non-HDL-C, and 
Triglycerides are defmed as the average of S 1 and Tl values (last two non-missing values 
on or prior to Day 1 ). If only one value is available, the single value will be used as 
baseline. For other parameters including apoB and hsCRP, the baseline is defmed as the 
last value/result where assessment date is less than or equal to the date of first study 
treatment, unless otherwise specified. If last dose of study treatment is missing, then the 
date of last visit at which study assessments were obtained on CRF will be used in its 
place.

5.2.2 Protocol Deviations Version 2.4, Mar 22, 2018 
Statistical Analysis Plan 
A full list of protocol deviations will be compiled and reviewed by the clinical team to 
identify key versus non-key deviations before final database lock. For deviations at study 
entry, patients will be assessed against the inclusion and exclusion criteria of the 
protocol. For on-study deviations, compliance with the protocol will be examined using 
blinded review of the database with regard to prohibited therapies, and timing and 
availability of planned assessments. The final list of protocol deviation will be approved 
by the study team prior to database lock and will be used to generate the PD deviation 
summary and listing. 
5.2.3 Patient Disposition 
The number of patients screened, randomized and included in each analysis population, 
along with study completion status, will be summarized by treatment group as well as 
overall. In addition, the number of patients who withdraw from the study and withdraw 
from IMP will be summarized by discontinuation reason. 
Patient disposition will also be summarized for patients who are on simvastatin 40 
mg/day or higher dose at any time during the study. The identification of these patients 
will be based on the concomitant statin medication use. 
5.2.4 Demographic and Baseline Characteristics 
The following demographic and baseline characteristics will be summarized by treatment 
group, as well as overall, for safety population and for FAS population: age (years), age 
will be summarized as a continuous variable and by age group (18-40, 41-64, 65-74, and 
>=75), gender, race, ethnicity, height (cm), weight (kg), body mass index (kg/m2), BMI

and baseline statin intensity (low, moderate, high), history of diabetics and hypertension, 
eGFR category, tobacco history, alcohol history, and weekly average number of alcoholic 
drinks. Data will be summarized using descriptive statistics for continuous variables and 
using counts and percentages for categorical variables by treatment group and overall. 
Demographic and baseline characteristics will be summarized for patients who are on 
simvastatin 40 mg/day or higher dose at any time during the study. 
The baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate ( eGFR) categories are: normal: 
~90 mL/min/l.73m2; mild Renal Impairment: 60-89 mL/min/l.73m2; moderate Renal 
Impairment: 30-59 mL/min/1.73m2, and severe Renal Impairment (15-29 
mL/min/1.73m2).

9) Region (North America, EU) 
In case the number of patients within a subgroup is too small, e.g. less than 5% of the 
overall population, the analyses may not be performed or the subgroup levels may be 
combined. 
5.2.6 Medical History 
General medical history, and cardiovascular history /risk factors will be summarized by 
trea1ment group, as well as overall, for FAS population and presented in a by-patient 
listing. Where appropriate, terms will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for 
Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) Version 18.1 or later. 
5.2.7 Baseline Serology, Serum and Urine Pregnancy Test and TSH 
Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis C virus (HCV), and serum pregnancy test 
(only for females of childbearing potential), follicle stimulating hormone ([FSH], only for 
females who are< 55 years old and> 1 year without menses), urine pregnancy test Day 1 
prior to randomization (only in Canada for females prior to amendment 3 and in all 
women who are of childbearing potential after amendment 3, and thyroid-stimulating 
hormone (TSH) will be presented in a by-patient listing. 
5.2.8 Prior and Concomitant Medications 
Prior medications are defmed as medications that ended prior to the initiation of double-
blind IMP. Concomitant medications are defined as medications that were ongoing at the 
time of double-blind IMP initiation or new medications that started post double-blind 
IMP initiation and within 30 days following the date of the last dose of IMP. 
Medications, including prior statin medications, will be coded using WHO Drug (March, 
2015, or later). The use of prior or concomitant medications will be summarized by 
trea1ment group, as well as overall, for the safety population according to Anatomical 
Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) class and coded medication name. Statin medications will 
be summarized separately. Prior and concomitant medications will be listed for each 
patient. 
Number of patients receiving additional (post-randomization) adjunctive lipid-modifying 
therapy will be identified by medication class and will be summarized by the reasons for 
their additional trea1ment (hyperlipidemia or. hypertriglyceridemia) per concomitant 
medication CRF.

5.2.9 IMP Exposure and Compliance Version 2.4, Mar 22, 2018 
Statistical Analysis Plan 
The length of exposure to IMP (ETC-1002 or placebo) will be calculated as the number 
of days from the first dose of double-blind IMP to the last dose of double-blind IMP, 
regardless if the patient missed one or more doses of IMP. Length of exposure will be 
summarized by treatment group using descriptive statistics for the safety population. 
The number and percentage of patients who were compliant with taking IMP will be 
summarized by treatment group for the safety population for the following categories 0-
<80%; >= 80%. 
Overall compliance will be calculated as: 1 OO• (Total Number of Tablets Dispensed -
Total Number of Tablets Returned) I (Treatment Duration in Days). The IMP 
administration and compliance data, including reasons for poor compliance, if noted in 
CRF will be listed for each patient. 
5.3 Primary Efficacy Endpoints and Analyses 
For all efficacy analyses, the FAS will be used, with patients included in their 
randomized group, regardless of the treatment they actually received. 
The primary and key secondary efficacy endpoints will be included in a step-down 
testing procedure to control overall type I error. Below endpoints will be tested 
sequentially at alpha level of 0.05. Each endpoint will be tested only if the previous 
endpoint achieved statistical significance. 
1. percent change from baseline to Week 12 in LDL-C (primary efficacy) 
2. percent change from baseline to Week 24 in LDL-C 
3. percent change from baseline to Week 12 in non-HDL-C 
4. percent change from baseline to Week 12 in TC 
5. percent change from baseline to Week 12 in apoB 
6. percent change from baseline to Week 12 in hsCRP 
The clinical hypothesis being tested for each respective endpoint is that a treatment 
regimen with bempedoic acid 180mg daily in addition to other lipid modifying therapies 
(including statin) will result in higher reduction in respective lipid value than that from 
the lipid modifying therapy alone. 
5.3.1 Analysis for the Efficacy Parameters 
Percent change in LDL-C, non-HDL-C, TC, and apoB at week 12 or week 24 will be 
analyzed using the analysis of covariance (ANCOV A) method. The ANCOV A model 
will include treatment, randomization stratum (from IWRS) as factors, and baseline value 
as covariate. In case of number of subjects within a stratum is too small for a meaningful 
analysis, the strata may be combined to obtain larger cell size. To account for the 
likelihood of unequal variances between the treatment groups, the ANCOV A model will 
be implemented within mixed model framework and the <repeated/group=> option will

5.3.3 Other Efficacy Endpoints Version 2.4, Mar 22, 2018 
Statistical Analysis Plan 
Percent change from baseline to week 52 in LDL-C will be analyzed using the ANCOV A 
method as described in section 5.3.1., using observed data (no imputation for missing 
data). 
In addition, the same endpoint will be analyzed with patients in the FAS who did not 
receive additional lipid-lowering therapy by that time point (by week 24 and 52). Only 
observed case data will be used. Non-HDL-C, TC, ApoB and hsCRP at week 24 and 52 
will be analyzed similarly using observed data. 
The proportion of patients achieving LDL-C < 70 mg/dL at week 12, 24, and 52 will be 
summarized by treatment group and compared by Chi-sq test or fisher exact test. Only 
observed data will be used, i.e. the denominator will be number of patients who have 
LDL-C value at perspective time point. 
TGs and HDL-C values at week 12, 24 and 52 will be summarized based on the FAS. For 
each parameter at each time point, the value of the parameter and the percent change 
from baseline in the parameter will be summarized by treatment group. 
In cases where triglycerides (TGs) is >400 mg/dL or LDL-C is ::;so mg/dL, a measured 
LDL (LDL-M) will be used instead of LDL-C for the analysis of that time point. If both 
values are available, LDL-M will be used. 
Baseline for each lipid is defined as the average of Sl (week -2) and predose 
Day I/Week 0 values (the last two non-missing values on or prior to Day 1) with 
exception for apoB and hsCRP, for which predose Day 1 value will be used. 
5.3.4 Sensitivity Analysis for Efficacy Endpoints 
• A sensitivity analysis for primary and key secondary endpoints included in the step-
down procedure will be performed using the ANCOV A model with derived stratum 
instead of IWRS randomized stratum. For details of how the stratum are derived 
using concomitant medication and medical history, please see Appendix 3. 
• The observed case data only (no imputations for missing data) analyses will also be 
used for sensitivity analyses for primary and key secondary endpoints. Observed data 
analysis will be conducted using FAS. 
• On-treatment analysis will be using data collected during the treatment period only, 
i.e. up to the date of last dose of IMP + 7 days (e.g. any efficacy data collected after 7 
days post last dose of IMP will be excluded for efficacy analysis). On-treatment 
analysis will be conducted using SP for primary and key secondary endpoints 
• By-visit summary for all efficacy endpoints (LDL-C, non-HDL-C, TC, ApoB, 
hsCRP, HDL-C and TGs) using on-treatment approach will be provided for both 
conventional and standard units.

5.3.5 Subgroup Analysis for Efficacy Endpoints Version 2.4, Mar 22, 2018 
Statistical Analysis Plan 
The LDL-C efficacy endpoints at week 12 will be analyzed within subgroups described 
in section 5.2.5. No imputation will be performed on missing data for subgroup analyses. 
Subgroups based on stratification factors will be derived from corresponding eCRFs such 
as targeted CV history or concomitant statin medication. 
A forest plot of treatment effect for the LDL-C endpoint within each subgroup will be 
provided. 
5.4 Primary Safety Endpoints and Analyses 
The safety and tolerability of ETC-1002 will be assessed by examination of TEAEs 
(including muscle related events and other AESI), physical exams, vital signs, 
electrocardiograms (ECGs), clinical laboratory values (serum chemistry, hematology, 
coagulation and urinalysis), and weight. These endpoints identified in Section 3 .2 with 
exception of PK-related endpoints, will be addressed as a result of the analysis 
description. All patients included in the SP will be evaluated in the safety analyses. 
Unless otherwise stated, descriptive summaries will be displayed by treatment group 
actually received and based on the SP. 
5.4.1 Adverse Events {AEs) 
AEs will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) 
Version 18.1 or later and will be categorized by system organ class (SOC) and preferred 
term (PT). Patients with AEs that are ongoing at study completion or study withdrawal 
must be followed until resolution or for 30 days after the last study visit, whichever 
comes first. Summary tables will focus on TEAEs; however, listings will include all AEs 
(with non-TEAEs flagged). 
In summary tables, TEAEs will be counted as ''Not Related" if relationship to IMP was 
recorded as 'Not Related' or "Unlikely". Events will be counted as "Related" if 
relationship to IMP was recorded as 'Possible', 'Probable', 'Definite' or if relationship to 
IMP is missing. 
The severity of the AE will be characterized as mild, moderate, or severe, to the 
following definitions: 
• Mild: Events are usually transient and do not interfere with the patient's daily 
activities 
• Moderate: Events introduce a low level of inconvenience or concern to the patient 
and may interfere with daily activities 
• Severe: Events interrupt the patient's usual daily activity, are incapacitating with 
inability to do usual activities, or significantly affect clinical status and warrant 
intervention and/or close follow-up 
Overviews of TEAEs will include total number of TEAEs and patient incidence of 
TEAE, TE SAE, related TEAE, related TE SAE, AESI, withdrew due to TEAE, Fatal

baseline LDL category. 
The AE overview summaries will count a patient at most once in each AE category (at 
the "highestlmost extreme" designation of each category regardless of preferred term) 
and percentages will be based on the total number of patients in the safety population. 
In addition to a comprehensive listing of all AEs (with non-TEAEs flagged), separate 
listings will be generated for SAEs, AEs resulting in withdrawal of IMP, and AEs with a 
fatal outcome.

findings that meet the definition of an AE will be recorded on the AE page of the eCRF 
and will be summarized with other AE outcomes. 
5.4.8 '\!ital Signs 
Actual values and changes from baseline in vital signs (heart rate, systolic blood pressure, 
diastolic blood pressure, weight, height [baseline only], and BMI) will be summarized 
using descriptive statistics by treatment group and post-baseline time point. Baseline is 
defined as the last value prior to the first dose of study medication. 
Vital signs data will be listed for each patient, with increases from baseline of> 15 mmHg 
in systolic or diastolic blood pressure flagged. 
5.4.9 Electrocardiogram (ECG) 
Shift tables for ECG data from baseline to end-of-study will be provided by treatment 
group. The data will be categorized as 'Normal'; 'Abnormal, not clinically significant'; 
and 'Abnormal, clinically significant.' Listings of ECG data will include only those 
records where the baseline ECG was either 'Normal' or 'Abnormal, not clinically 
significant', but the end-of-study ECG was marked as 'Abnormal, clinically significant'. 
5.5 Pharmacok.inetic Endpoints and Other Biomarkers 
Plasma concentrations of ETC-1002 and its metabolite ESP15228 will be determined 
from 6 mL whole blood samples collected from patients at Weeks 12, 24, and 52 for 
those patients randomized prior to Amendment 3 in the EU and Amendment 4 in the US. 
At the time of sample collection, the date and time of blood draw and the last 2 doses of 
study medication will be collected. Any PK concentration with sample draw time outside 
of the 18-30 hours from last dose of IMP will be excluded from the summary. 
In all data presentations (except listings), concentrations below the limit of quantitation 
(BLQ) will be set to zero. In listings, BLQ values will be reported as less than the lower 
limit of quantification ( <LLQ).

Appendix 3: Derived Randomization Stratum Version 2.4, Mar 22, 2018 
Statistical Analysis Plan 
Randomization stratum contains two factors: baseline statin intensity and cardiovascular 
history/risk factor. Derived randomization stratum will be based on available records in 
concomitant medication and medical history. 
For cardiovascular history/risk factors: "ASCVD Only" vs. "HeFH with/without 
ASCVD". It will be derived from medical history. If a patient has a medical history of 
HeFH noted on the cardiovascular history page, then this patient will be categorized as 
"HeFH (with/without ASCVD)"; if a patient doesn't have medical history of HeFH, but 
with a history of cardiovascular history/risk factor (as collected on the CV history CRF), 
then this patient will be categorized as "ASCVD only"; if a patient doesn't have medical 
history of either HeFH or cardiovascular disease, the patient will be considered as not 
qualified. 
Baseline statin intensity was categorized as High, Moderate and Low Intensity. It will be 
derived from concomitant medication using the latest Statin record prior to 
randomization. Average daily dose is calculated and the statin intensity is determined 
based on below table. The patient will be considered as "Low Intensity Statin" if the 
patient has no record of statin use. 
High Intensity Statins Moderate Intensity Statins Low Intensity Statins 
Atorvastatin 40-80 mg Atorvastatin 10-<40 mg Atorvastatin <1 Omg 
Rosuvastatin 20-40 mg Rosuvastatin S-<20 mg Rosuvastatin <Smg

SUMMARY OF CHANGES 
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS  PLAN  
 
Study Number:  ETC 1002-040 
Study Title:  A RANDOMIZED, DOUBLE -BLIND, PLACEBO-
CONTROLLED, MULTICENTER LONG- TERM 
SAFETY AND TOLERABILITY STUDY OF ETC -1002 
IN PATIENTS WITH HYPERLIPIDEMIA AT HIGH 
CARDIOVASCULAR RISK WHO ARE NOT ADEQUATELY CONTROLLED BY THEIR LIPID-MODIFYING THERAPY 
Final SAP  Version:  22 Mar 2018 
Original SAP  Version:  21 Mar 2016 
The original SAP dated 22Mar2016 was completed subsequent to the protocol amendment 2, 
dated 23Feb2016. Since then, the SAP was revised during the course of the study to:  
1. Incorporate changes due to protocol amendments. 
2. Improve the clarity and organization of the analyses . 
3. Incorporate recommendations from the FDA and external experts. 
The main changes are summarized below:  
1. Per protocol amendment 3 dated 28 July 2016, the sample size was increased from 900 to 
1950. The number of subjects to be enrolled and s ample size determination section was 
updated to reflect such change.  The rational for increased sample size was to provide adequate exposure to assess safety for the bempedoic acid (ETC -1002) program. 
2. Per protocol amendment 3, t he eGFR  category definition was changed to include eGFR 
30 - < 45 mL/min/1.73m
2 
3. General language in the laboratory evaluation section was updated to reflect changed language in hepatic parameters monitoring in protocol amendment 3. 
4. PK analysis set was updated to reflect PK assessments being removed in protocol amendment 3. 
5. Per protocol amendment 4 dated 14 Oct 2016, simva 40 mg daily dose or higher were 
allowed .  Additional visits for safety assessment were added in the protocol for these 
patients. As a result, the analysis window mapping and laboratory summary were updated 
accordingly.   
6. Clarified in the SAP that the study objective is supported by both safety and efficacy.  Defined the safety endpoints to be primary safety and efficacy endpoints to be primary

Confidential  efficacy. The rationale for this change is because while the study was designed to provide 
the largest safety database and the longest exposure for safety  evaluation for the program, 
this is a double-blind and placebo- controlled study and the efficacy parameters were 
collected in a similar fashion to other phase 3 studies, the efficacy data from this study is important to understand the effectiveness of bem pedoic acid   
7. The efficacy endpoints were organized in a hierarchical order to match other phase 3 studies and type I error control testing procedure (gatekeeping) was proposed to control the family -wise type I error. The purpose was to strengthen the rigor of the efficacy 
analyses and allow better integration with other phase 3 studies. 
8. Incorporated more details (no method change) around missing data imputation using patterns mixed model (PMM) .  The reference publication for PMM was provided. 
9. Specified non-parametric analysis will be used for hsCRP due to known skewed distribution, which was also confirmed by historical knowledge, publication precedence and recent data available,  
10. In protocol amendment 5 dated 10 May 2017, patients who were on simva 40 mg/da y or 
higher dose were withdrew from the study treatment. Subgroup analyses for adverse events and safety laboratory were added in order to gain further understanding of this 
group of patients. 
11. Definition for baseline lipid parameters was updated to use the mean of screening and T1 
instead of single value on T1.  This change was made to be consistent with other phase 3 
studies. 
12. Added subgroup analysis for efficacy and safety. Subgroup analysis for large phase 3 
study is expected.  
13. Added sensitivity analysis f or efficacy endpoints. This change was made to assess the 
robustness of the primary analysis result.  
14. Added exploratory analysis for proportion of patients achieve LDL- C < 70 mg/dL at each 
visit.  
15. Updated the list of preferred terms for AESI and abnormal lab cutoff. This change was made based on further understanding of the safety profile for bempedoic acid from recent 
data and DMC recommendation. 
16. Administrative and editorial changes were made throughout the document. 
 
The final SAP dated 22Mar2018 was completed and signed off prior to the database lock for 
Study 1002-040.

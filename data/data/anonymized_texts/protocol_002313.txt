2.1 Background and Rationale
Why Is This Study Being Conducted?
AGN -151586 is an investigational product being developed for the treatment of glabellar lines (GL).  
Facial lines that develop from repeated facial expression, such as GL, are typically treated by selectively 
weakening specific muscles with small quantities of botulinum toxin.1-5  Botulinum toxins reversibly 
block presynaptic acetylcholine release at the neuromuscular or neuroglandular junction.  
There are 8 antigenicall y-distinct botulinum neurotoxin serotypes (A, B, C1, D, E, F, G, and H) that are 
similar in structure and action and produced by different strains of the anaerobic bacterium Clostridium 
botulinum .  Botulinum Neurotoxin Serotype A (BoNT/A) is popular as a c osmetic treatment of GL in 
adults due to its proven efficacy for reducing moderate to severe facial lines,6well documented safety 
profile,7and positive impact on psychological well -being and the resulting psychosocial b enefits.8  
Botulinum Neurotoxin Serotype E is the active ingredient of AGN -151586.  The rationale for the use of 
AGN -151586 to treat GL is the same as that for BoNT/A in that by inhibiting the release of the 
neurotransmitter acetylcholine at peripheral cholinergic nerve endings,9,10the overactivity of the 
muscles responsible for these lines can be reduced, thus eliminating or diminishing the appearanc e of 
GL.  AGN -151586 offers the potential for faster onset of efficacy compared with the BoNT/A products.9  
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of AGN -151586 for the treatment of GL in 
subjects with moderate to severe GL.
2.2 Benefits and Risks to Subjects
Allergan (an AbbVie company) completed 1 dose ranging study (Study 2034 -201-008) to explore the 
safety and efficacy of single cycle treatments at doses ranging from  AGN -151586 -specific 
units for the treatment of GL in adults.  Unit s of biological activity of AGN -151586 cannot be converted 
to those of other neurotoxin products.
In this Phase 2b Study, a clinical dose response was observed, demonstrating that the proportion of 
responders (i.e., subjects having ≥ 2-grade improvement from baseline as assessed by investigator 
through Day 7) increased with increasing AGN -151586 dose.  The responder rate was approximately 
95% for the cohort dosed with   The overall incidence of study drug -related treatment -emergent 
adverse event (TEAE s) was similar between the placebo group (18.0%) compared with the AGN -151586 
group (20.9%).  There were no safety trends or patterns identified with increasing dose of AGN -151586.  
Overall, AGN -151586 had a favorable safety profile with  showing the most robust benefit and 
thus,  was selected for Phase 3 pivotal studies. 
Based on the Phase 2b Study results, there are no known adverse drug reactions (ADRs) for 
AGN -151586 .  Since AGN -151586 is given as an intramuscular injection, injection site re actions 
(e.g., pain, bruising, swelling, etc.) are anticipated.  In addition, the mechanism of action of AGN -151586 
is similar to BOTOX and thus, adverse reactions associated with BOTOX, when injected into the glabellar

CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
No use or disclosure outside AbbVie is permitted without prior written authorization from AbbVie.region, may also occur with AGN -1515 86.  These ADRs include facial pain, facial paresis, eyelid pt osis, 
and muscular weakness.
The overall benefit:risk profile is anticipated to be favorable.
For further details, please see findings from completed studies, including safety data in the current 
AGN -151586 Investigator's Brochure.
Considering the coronavirus disease –2019 ( COVID -19) pandemic ,and based on the information to 
date , no additional risk to study participants is anticipated with the use of AGN -151586.  While AbbVie 
does not consider COVID -19 to be a safety concern for AGN -151586 or BOTOX due to their mechanism 
of action and route of administration, the marketing authorization holder is monitoring COVID -19 events 
during the pandemic closely. A recent review of COVID -19 events fo r the period of 01 January 2019 
through 31 December 2021 did not identify any new or significant safety findings for the patients 
receiving BOTOX treatment with onabotulinumtoxinA -branded products (BOTOX, BOTOX Cosmetic, 
VISTABEL ®, VISTABEX ®, and BOTOX Vis ta 50 ®) or botulinum toxin type A products (in which the 
manufacturer was not identified).   Overall, the clinical course and presentation of patients with 
COVID -19 infection coincident with onabotulinumtoxinA -branded products and botulinum toxin type A 
products is consistent with what has been described for the general population. The same results are 
expected with AGN -151586 since onabotulinumtoxinA -branded products, botulinum toxin type A 
products, and AGN -151586 have a similar mechanism of action.  
3OBJECTIVES AND ENDPOINTS
3.1 Objectives, Hypotheses, and Estimands
Overall Objective
The objective of this pivotal study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of AGN -151586 for the 
treatment of GL in subjects with moderate to severe GL.
The clinical hypotheses a re:
AGN -151586 is more effective than placebo in treating GL, as measured by both investigator
and subject assessment sof GL severity at maximum frown using the Facial Wrinkle Scale (FWS). 
AGN -151586 has an acceptable safety profile after single and repeat treatments.
Estimands: Primary Endpoints
The attributes of the estimands corresponding to the coprimary efficacy endpoints are summarized in 
Table 1.  In addition, the attribute of treatment is a single dose of AGN -151586 or placebo.

4.1 Overall Study Design and Plan
This is a 12 -week, multicenter, Phase 3 study designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of 
AGN -151586 in treating GL.  Subjects are adults ( ≥ 18 years of age) with moderate to severe GL at 
maximum frown as assessed independently by both the investigator and subject using the FWS.  The
investigator and subject ratings for GL will be done at the Screening Visit and at the Baseline Day 1 Visit.  
The investigator and subject ratings must match within a visit but do not have to match between 
Screening and Baseline Day 1.  Each eligible subj ect may receive up to 2 study treatments with 
AGN -151586. The time of study treatment administration defines H our 0 forthe treatment period ( on 
Day 1 for double -blind period and on Day 43 for open- label period ). 
Eligible subjects will be enrolled into the study containing 2 treatment periods: 
Double -blind Period: 
Screening will occur up to 14 days prior to Baseline Day 1.  Randomization and treatment will occur on 
Baseline Day 1 after all other study procedures have been completed.  A single treatment of 
AGN -151586  or placebo will be administered on Baseline Day 1, based on randomization (3:1 ratio 
of AGN -151586:placebo).  Randomization will be stratified by investigator site , toxin use history ( for 
aesthetic purpose ), and baseline GL severity at maximum frown.  All enrolled subjects will receive 
treatment on Baseline Day 1 and attend in -clinic site visits  to fully 
characterize the onset of treatment effect.  Thereafter,  in-clinic site visits  
 will be completed to characterize the peak and duration of effect.
The double -blind period will end on Day 43.  The Day 43 visit will occur 42 ±2 days following the Day 1 
visit.  The study assessm ents conducted during the Day 43 visit serve as the final assessment for the 
double -blind period and as the baseline assessment for the open -label period. 
Open- label Period: 
For subjects meeting all the retreatment criteria on Day 43, a single open -label treatment with 
AGN -151586  will be administered on the same day.  The subject will then be followed for 
approximately 6 weeks (through Day 84).  The schedule of the follow -up visits in the open- label period is 
the same as that in the double -blind per iod.  After each study treatment administration, subjects must 
remain in the clinic for at least 30 minutes for observation of any AEs. 
Retreatment is only permitted on the Day 43 visit.  
If the subject does not meet the GL severity criterion at Day 43 v isit for retreatment, the subject will be 
followed weekly as per the Activity Schedule ( Appendix D) until the FWS grades assessed by both 
investigato r and subject have returned to moderate or severe (investigator and subject grades do not 
need to match) before being discontinued from the study after completing either the Early Exit or Study 
ExitVisit.  If the subject becomes pregnant, then study drug may not be administered, and the subject 
can either be discontinued from the study after Early Exit Visit procedures are completed or remain in 
the study for all safety follow -up assessments.  If the subject declines retreatment despite meeting the 
retreat ment criteria at Day 43 visit, the subject may be discontinued from the study after Early Exit Visit 
procedures are completed.

The study population will be adult subjects with moderate or severe GL at maximum frown as assessed 
by both the investigator and subject using the FWS.  Eligibility criteria will be assessed at Screening Visit 
and Baseline Day 1 Visit to ensure subject safety. 
Selection of Doses in the Study
In the previous Phase 2b Study 2034 -201-008, a clinical dose response was observed, demonstrating 
that the proportion of responders (i.e., subjects having ≥ 2-grade improvement from baseline as 
assessed by investigator through Day 7) increased with increasing AGN -151586 dose.  The responder 
rate was approximately 95% for the cohort dosed with . The overall incidence of study drug -
related TEAEs was similar between the placebo group (18.0%) compared with the AGN -151586 group 
(20.9%).  There were no safety trends or patterns identified with increasing the dose of AGN -151586.  
Overall, AG N-151586 had a favorable safety profile and  AGN -151586 showed the most robust 
benefit and thus,  AGN -151586 was selected for the Phase 3 pivotal studies.
The dose selected is expected to be efficacious with an acceptable safety profile.

5.6 Withdrawal of Subjects and Discontinuation of Study
A subject canvoluntarily withdraw at any time or will be withdrawn from the study for reasons 
including, but not limited to, the following:  
Clinically significant abnormal laboratory results or AEs, which rule out continuation of the study 
drug, as determined by the investigator or the Sponsor.  However, wh en possible, the subject is 
encouraged to remain in the study for all safety follow -up assessments, even if the subject does 
not meet retreatment criteria. 
The investigator believes it is in the best interest of the subject.
The subject requests withdrawa l from the study.

CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
No use or disclosure outside AbbVie is permitted without prior written authorization from AbbVie.Eligibility criteria violation was noted after the subject started study drug and continuation of 
the study drug would place the subject at risk.
Introduction of prohibited medications or dosages and continuation of the study drug would 
place the subject at risk.
Subject is significantly noncompliant with study procedures.
If the subject does not meet the GL severity criterion at Day 43 visit for retreatment, the subject 
will be followed weekly per the visit schedule ( Appendix D) until the FWS grades assessed by 
both investigator and subject have returned to moderate or severe (investigator and subject 
grades do not need to match) befor e being discontinued from the study by completing either 
the Early Exit or S tudy ExitVisit .
If the subject becomes pregnant, then study drug willnot be administered, and the subject can 
either be discontinued from the study after Early Exit Visit procedu res are completed or remain 
in the study for all safety follow -up assessments.  If a pregnancy occurs in a study subject, 
information regarding the pregnancy and the outcome will be collected.
If the subject declines retreatment despite meeting the retreat ment criteria at Day 43 visit, the 
subject willbe discontinued from the study after Early Exit Visit procedures are completed
unless the investigator determines the subject should remain in the study for safety follow -up.
For subjects to be considered lo st to follow -up, reasonable attempts must be made to obtain 
information on the subject's final status.  At a minimum, 2 telephone calls must be made and 1 certified 
letter must be sent and documented in the subject's source documentation.
The following eve nts, if applicable, willalso cause premature termination of the clinical study:
Unjustifiable risk and/or toxicity in risk -benefit analysis (decision taken by sponsor 
representative), e.g., when AEsoccur, unknown to date in respect of their nature, severity, 
duration or frequency in relation to the current established safety profile (substantial changes in 
risk-benefit considerations), and therefore medical and/or ethical reasons affect the continue d 
performance of the study.
New scientific evidence becomes available during the study that could affect the patient 's safety 
(benefit -risk analysis no longer positive), e.g., new insights from other clinical trials.
Request of the sponsor or regulatory ag ency, e.g., as a consequence 
ofinspection; favorable opinion withdrawn by ethics commission.
In case of difficulties in the recruitment of the planned number of subjects inthe indicated time 
(insufficient recruitment rate).
Withdrawal of the license to m anufacture or of the permission to import.
AbbVie canterminate this study prematurely, either in its entirety or at any site.  The investigator can
also stop the study at his/her site if he/she has safety concerns.  If AbbVie terminates the study for 
safety reasons, AbbVie will promptly notify the investigator and appropriate Health Authority.

During the COVID -19 pandemic, it has been necessary to employ mitigation strategies to enable the 
investigator to ensure subject safety and continuity of care.  Acceptable mitigation strategies are 
identified and included in the Operations Manual ( Appendix F), Section 2 and Section 3.
The investigator should contact the sponsor before discontinuing a subject from the study for a reason 
other than described in the protocol to ensure all acceptable mitigation steps have been explored.
Interruption/D iscontinuation of Study Drug Due to COVID -19 Infection
During the study drug dosing period, a subject with confirmed (viral test positive) or suspected 
COVID -19 infection can only be dosed with study drug if the following COVID- 19 viral clearance criteria 
are met:
At least 1 0days since first positive test result have passed in asymptomatic patients or at least 
10days since recovery, defined as resolution of fever without use of antipyretics and 
improvement in symptoms.
Delays in study drug dosing due to the above COVID -19 testing guidance for subjects must be discussed 
with the AbbVie medical contact, along with the possibility of early exit from the study drug dosing 
period .  Follow subsequent protocol Section 5.7for subjects who discontinued study drug.
5.7 Follow -Up After Subject Discontinuation of Study Drug or from 
Study
For subjects who 
are ineligible for retreat ment because of not meeting GL severity criterion on Day 43, the 
subjects will be followed weekly per the visit schedule ( Appendix D) until the FWS g rades 
assessed by both investigator and subject have returned to moderate or severe (investigator 
and subject grades do not need to match) before being discontinued by completing either the 
Early Exit or S tudy ExitVisit .
are ineligible for retreatment bec ause of pregnancy, the subjects will not receive study drug.  
They can either be discontinued from the study after Early Exit Visit procedures are completed 
or remain in the study for all safety follow -up assessments. 
prematurely discontinue study treatme nt, or who prematurely discontinue study participation 
(due to withdrawal of informed consent or if the protocol -specified discontinuation criteria are 
met), the procedures outlined for the Early Exit visit (in Appendix D) should be completed as 
soon as possible, preferably within 2 weeks, but no sooner than 30 days since last treatment.

5.9 Randomization/Drug Assignment
At the Screening Visit, all su bjects will be assigned a unique identification number using the IRT.  For 
subjects who rescreen, the screening number assigned by the IRT at the initial Screening Visit should be 
used.  The IRT will assign a randomization number that will encode the subje ct's treatment group 
assignment according to the randomization schedule (3:1 ratio AGN -151586:placebo ).
Randomization will be stratified by investigator site , toxin use history (for aesthetic purpose), and 
baseline GL severity at maximum frown.   
 
  To support this, the site will manually enter the subject's Baseline Day 1 FWS score (moderate or 
severe; per eligibility criteria, the investigator and subject FWS assessments must be identical) , toxin use 
history (for aesthetic purpose ),and the Baseline Day 1 FLO -11 total score (as calculated by the electronic 
data capture [EDC] after the subject completes the questionnaire) in to the IRT.  
All AbbVie personnel with direct oversight of the conduct and management of the trial (with the 
exception of AbbVie Drug Supply Management Team), the investigator, study site personnel, and the 
subject will remain blinded to each subject's treatment throughout the study.  To maintain the blind, the Investigational Medicinal

CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
No use or disclosure outside AbbVie is permitted without prior written authorization from AbbVie.All follow -up information is to be reported to the sponsor (or an authorized representative) and 
documented in source as required by the sponsor.  Product complaints associated with AEs will be 
reported in the study su mmary.  All other complaints will be monitored on an ongoing basis.  Product 
complaints occurring during the study will be followed up to a satisfactory conclusion.
Medical Complaints/Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events
An AE is defined as any untowa rd medical occurrence in a subject or clinical investigation subject 
administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with 
this treatment.  An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory finding or vital sign measurement), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use 
of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not the event is considered causally related to the 
use of the product.
Such an event ca n result from use of the drug as stipulated in the protocol or labeling, as well as from 
"special situations" such as accidental or intentional overdose, medication error, occupational or 
accidental exposure, off -label use, drug abuse, drug misuse, or drug withdrawal, all which must be 
reported whether associated with an AE or not.  Any worsening of a pre -existing condition or illness is 
considered an AE.  Worsening in severity of a reported AE should be reported as a new AE.  Laboratory 
abnormalities and c hanges in vital signs are considered to be AEs only if they result in discontinuation 
from the study, necessitate therapeutic medical intervention, and/or if the investigator considers them 
to be AEs.
The investigators will monitor each subject for clinica l and laboratory evidence of AEs on a routine basis 
throughout the study.  All AEs will be followed to a satisfactory conclusion.
An elective surgery/procedure scheduled to occur during a study will not be considered an AE if the 
surgery/procedure is being performed for a pre -existing condition and/or the surgery/procedure has 
been pre -planned prior to study entry.  However, if the pre -existing condition deteriorates unexpectedly 
during the study (e.g., surgery performed earlier than planned), then the dete rioration of the condition 
for which the elective surgery/procedure is being done will be considered an AE.
If an AE, whether associated with study drug or not, meets any of the following criteria, it is to be 
reported to AbbVie clinical pharmacovigilance as a serious adverse event (SAE) immediately without 
undue delay, but no later than 24 hours , from when the site ismade aware of the SAE (refer to 
Section 4.2 of the Operations Manual for reporting details and contact information):
Death of Subject An event that results in the death of a subject.
Life-Threatening An event that, in the opinion of the investigator, would have 
resulted in immediate fatality if medical intervention had not been 
taken.  This does not include an event that would have been fatal if it 
had occurred in a more severe form.
Hospitalization or 
Prolongation of 
HospitalizationAn event that results in an admission to the hospital for any length 
of time or prolongs the subject's hospital stay.  This does not include 
an emergency room visit or admission to an outpatient facility.

CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
No use or disclosure outside AbbVie is permitted without prior written authorization from AbbVie.Congenital Anomaly An anomaly detected at or after bi rth, or any anomaly that results in 
fetal loss.
Persistent or Significant 
Disability/IncapacityAn event that results in a condition that substantially interferes with 
the activities of daily living of a study subject.  Disability is not 
intended to inclu de experiences of relatively minor medical 
significance such as headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, 
and accidental trauma (e.g., sprained ankle).
Important Medical Event 
Requiring Medical or Surgical 
Intervention to Prevent 
Serious OutcomeAnimportant medical event that may not be immediately life -
threatening or result in death or hospitalization, but based on 
medical judgment may jeopardize the subject and may require 
medical or surgical intervention to prevent any of the outcomes 
listed abo ve (i.e., death of subject, life -threatening, hospitalization, 
prolongation of hospitalization, congenital anomaly, or persistent or 
significant disability/incapacity).  Additionally, any elective or 
spontaneous abortion or stillbirth is considered an impo rtant 
medical event. 
All AEs reported from the time of study drug administration will be collected for at least 30 days after 
last dose or until the last follow -up visit, whichever is longer, whether solicited or spontaneously 
reported by the subject. In addition, study procedure -related serious and nonserious AEs will be 
collected from the time the subject signs the study -specific informed consent.
The following definitions will be used for Serious Adverse Reactions (SAR) and Suspected Unexpected 
Serious Adverse Reaction (SUSAR):
SAR Defined as all noxious and unintended responses to an Investigational Medicinal 
Product (IMP) related to any dose administered that result in an SAE as defined 
above.
SUSAR Refers to individual SAE case reports from clini cal trials where a causal 
relationship between the SAE and the IMP was suspected by either the sponsor 
or the investigator, is unexpected (not listed in the applicable Reference Safety 
Information), and meets one of the above serious criteria.
AbbVie wil l be responsible for SUSAR reporting for the investigational medicinal product (IMP) in 
accordance with global and local requirements.
Adverse events will be monitored throughout the study to identify any of special interest that may 
indicate a trend or ri sk to subjects.
Adverse Events of Special Interest
There are no AEs of special interest in this study.

CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
No use or disclosure outside AbbVie is permitted without prior written authorization from AbbVie.Adverse Event Severity and Relationship to Study Drug
The investigators will rate the severity of each AE as mild, moderate, or severe.
The investigator will use the following definitions to rate the severity of each AE:
Mild The AE is transient and easily tolerated by the subject.
Moderate The AE causes the subject discomfort and interrupts the subject's usual 
activities.
Severe The AE causes considerable interference with the subject's usual activities 
and may be incapacitating or life -threatening.
The investigator will use the following definitions to assess the relationship of the AE to the use of study 
drug and to the injection procedure:
Reasonable 
PossibilityAfter consideration of factors including timing of the event, biologic 
plausibility, clinical judgment, and potential alternative causes, there is 
sufficient evidence (information) to suggest a causal relationship.
No Reasonable 
PossibilityAfter consideration of factors including timing of the event, biologic 
plausibility, clinical judgment, and potential alternative causes, there is 
insufficient evidence (information) to suggest a causal relationship.
Pregnancy
While not an AE, pregnancy in a study subject must be reported to AbbVie within 24 hours after the site 
becomes aware of the pregnancy.  Subjects who become pregnant can either be discontinued from the 
study after Early Exit Visit procedures or remain in t he study for follow -up through study exit but will 
receive no further treatment with the study drug.  If a pregnancy occurs in a study subject, information 
regarding the pregnancy and the outcome will be collected.  Partner pregnancy information will not be 
collected.
The pregnancy outcome of an elective or spontaneous abortion, stillbirth or congenital anomaly is 
considered a nSAE and must be reported to AbbVie immediately without undue delay, but no later than 
24 hours ,from when the site is made aware of the event.
6.2 Other Safety Data Collection
Possible Distant Spread of Toxin
Possible distant spread of toxin (PDSOT) is defined as a possible pharmacologic effect of botulinum toxin 
at sites noncontiguous and distant from the site of injection.  Utilizing a standardized methodology to 
assess for PDSOT, Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities ( MedDRA )preferred terms (PTs) that may 
be associated with botulinum toxin effects have been prospectively identified (the statistical analysis 
plan [SAP] will inclu de a complete list of these PTs).  Adverse events reporting any of these terms will be

7STATISTICAL METHODS & DETERM INATION OF SAMPLE SIZE
7.1 Statistical and Analytical Plans
The statistical methods provided in this protocol will be focused on primary and secondary analyses.  
Complete and specific details of the statistical analysis will be described in the SAP.
The primary analysis will be conducted after all subjects have completed their end of study visit for the 
purpose of submission.
7.2 Definition for Analysis Populations
The following population sets will be used for the analyses.
The ITT Population includes all randomiz ed subjects.  For double -blind period analyses, subjects will be 
included in the analysis according to the treatment groups to which they were randomized.  For open -
label period analyses, data will be analyzed according to the treatments randomized in the double -blind 
period and received in the open -label period (i.e., AGN -151586/AGN -151586, AGN -151586/None, 
Placebo/AGN -151586, Placebo/None).
Baseline analyses and efficacy analyses for US FDA and EU Regulatory agencies will be performed on the 
ITT populatio n, consisting of all randomized subjects.  Subjects will be included in the double -blind 
period analysis according to the treatment groups to which they were randomized.  For open -label 
period analyses, data will be analyzed according to the treatments ran domized in the double -blind 
period and received in the open -label period (i.e., AGN -151586/AGN -151586, AGN -151586/None, 
Placebo/AGN -151586, Placebo/None).
Additionally, for EU regulatory agencies only, subgroup analyses will be performed on the ITT 
populat ion, that also has a baseline FLO -11 total score ≤ 50.  Analyses will consist of the EU primary and 
key secondary endpoints.
The Safety Analysis Set consists of all subjects who were treated with at least 1 dose of study drug (i.e., 
AGN -151586 or placebo).   All safety analyses will be performed with subjects analyzed by their actual 
treatment received in double -blind period/open- label period (i.e., AGN -151586/AGN -151586, 
AGN -151586/None, Placebo/AGN -151586, Placebo/None), and will be presented with overall safety 
data for the study (i.e., either period), for double -blind period, and for open -label period.  The Safety 
Analysis Set will be used for all safety analyses.

Secondary Endpoints
The prima ry efficacy endpoint of the composite endpoints for the US FDA and the coprimary endpoints 
for the EU regulatory agencies (defined in Section 3.2), respectively, will be analyzed based on the ITT 
population and the following methods will be used to address potential intercurrent events:
Subjects who did not receive any dose of study drug but are randomized will still be included in 
the ITT populati on.  For the EU, those who also had baseline FLO -11 total score of ≤ 50 will be 
included in subgroup analyses of the coprimary and key secondary endpoints.
Subjects who are randomized but prematurely discontinued the study before assessment of the 
primary endpoints will be considered as part of the ITT population.
Subjects who die before assessment of the primary endpoints will count as though they 
hypothetically continued in the study.
Subjects who are lost to follow -up and are missing data for the primary endpoints will count as 
though they hypothetically continued in the study.
Subjects who are missing assessments or data due to the COVID -19 pandemic and are missing 
data for the primary endpoints will count as though they hypothetically continued in the s tudy.
Subjects who are missing data for any other reason for the primary endpoints will count as 
though they hypothetically continued in the study.
The efficacy analysis of secondary endpoints (defined in Section 3.3) will be analyzed based on the same 
populations as above with similar methods for addressing potential intercurrent events.
7.4 Statistical Analyses for Efficacy
Demographics, baseline or di sease characteristics, medical history, and prior and concomitant 
medications will be summarized for the ITT population.  Medical history data will be reported and 
summarized separately from prior procedures data for the ITT population. Medical history da ta and 
prior procedure data will be coded using the MedDRA .  Prior and concurrent procedures will be 
summarized by MedDRA high level term and PT.
Summary and Analysis of the Primary Endpoints
Analysis of the respective primary endpoints will be conducted o n the ITT Population for the US and for 
the EU regulatory agencies based on treatment as randomized. 
The assessments of the severity of GL at maximum frown using the validated FWS is based on the 
following scale:
0 = None
1 = Mild
2 = Moderate

CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
No use or disclosure outside AbbVie is permitted without prior written authorization from AbbVie.3 = Severe
The composite primary endpoint for FDA is the following:
≥ 2-grade improvement from baseline on the FWS according to both investigator and subject 
assessments of GL severity at maximum frown at Day 7 
The coprimary endpoints for EU regulatory agencies consist of the following:
≥ 2-grade improvement from baseline on the FWS according to subject assessment of GL 
severity at maximum frown at Day 7, and
≥ 2-grade improvement from baseline on the FWS according to investigator assessment of GL 
severity at maximum frown at Day 7.
The attributes of the estimands corresponding to the primary efficacy endpoints for the US FDA and EU 
regulatory agencies are summarized in Section 3.1.
US FDA: The composite primary responder endpoint for at least a 2 -grade improvement will be analyzed 
using the Cochran- Mantel -Haenszel (CMH) method
  The primary endpoint must meet 
p≤0.05 to be considered successful.
European Union regulatory agencies:  The coprimary responder endpoints for ≥ 2-grade improvement 
from baseline in the FWS will be analyzed separately usin g the CMH method  
.  Both 
coprimary endpoints must meet p≤ 0.05 to be considered successful.
The evaluation of the equality of the proporti ons of responders for the primary endpoints at Day 7 will 
be based on the CMH test stratified by investigator site , toxin use history, and baseline FWS .  (Sites may 
be pooled for stratification purposes if there are too few subjects in a site.) A p -value ≤0.05 (2 -sided 
testing) will be claimed as statistically significant.   
 
For primary and secondary endpoints, missing data will first be imput ed at the visit level using multiple 
imputation, and then the responder definitions will be applied.  Details are provided in the SAP for 
missing data handling.
Sensitivity analyses of the primary efficacy variables will be performed to establish their consistency and 
robustness as well as to further characterize the extent of subjects' responses. As-observed data 
analysis, as well as missing as non- responder (using non-responder imputation [NRI]) analysis, stratified 
by baseline FWS and by investigator site are planned for sensitivity analyses.

Summary and Analysis of Secondary Endpoints
Secondary efficacy endpoints for the US FDA and EU regulatory agencies are listed in Section 3.3, and 
include other response definitions for the FWS by investigator and subject, as well as for the FLO -11, 
FLSQ, and GAC -GL. 
The attributes of the estimands corresponding to the secondary efficacy endpoints are summarized in 
Section 3.1.  Analysis of the secondary endpoints will be conducted on the ITT population based on 
treatment as randomized for the US FDA and the EU regulatory agencies.
For the secondary endpoints, the proportion of responders wi ll be analyzed using the CMH test  
.  The continuous 
variables will be analyzed using analysis of covariance with treatment as the main effect,  
.

CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
No use or disclosure outside AbbVie is permitted without prior written authorization from AbbVie.7.5 Statistical Analyses for Safety
The safety analyses will be performed using the safety population (i.e., Safety Analysis Set) .  The safety 
parameters will include AEs , vital sign measurements, 12 -lead ECG, laboratory evaluations (hematology 
and chemistry), neurological assessment (examination to consist of assessment of cranial nerves II 
through VII), physical examination, and immunogenicity.  The last nonmissing safet y assessment before 
study drug administration will be used as the baseline for all analyses of that endpoint.
Treatment -emergent AEs are defined as any AE with the onset that is after the first dose of study drug.  
Events where the onset date is the same a s the study drug start date are assumed to be treatment -
emergent, unless known to have started prior to study treatment administration. 
An overview of AEs will be presented consisting of the number and percentage of subjects experiencing 
at least one even t for each of the following AE categories:
1.Any TEAE
2.Any TEAE related to study treatment according to the investigator (i.e., study drug -related, study 
injection procedure -related)
3.Any severe TEAE
a.Any severe TEAE related to study treatment according to the investigator
4.Any serious TEAE
a.Any serious TEAE related to study treatment according to the investigator
5.Any TEAE leading to discontinuation of study drug
6.Any TEAE leading to death
7.PDSOT TEAEs
8.Neurological assessment TEAEs
9.All deaths

STUDY M21 -500  |  Version 2.0  |  EudraCT 2021 -003667- 10
CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
No use or disclosure outside AbbVie is permitted without prior written authorization from AbbVie.Treatment -emergent AEs will be summarized by system organ class (SOC) and PT; by maximum 
relationship to study treatment (i.e., study drug related, study injection procedure related) as assessed 
by the investigator (e.g., reasonable possibility or no reaso nable possibility) and SOC and PT; by 
maximum severity and SOC and PT; and by subject number and SOC and PT.  Specific treatment -
emergent AEs will be counted once for each subject for calculating percentages, unless stated 
otherwise.  In addition, if the s ame AE occurs multiple times within a subject, the AE will be counted 
only once, and the highest severity and level of relationship to investigational product will be reported.
Serious AEs (including deaths) and AEs leading to study drug discontinuation wi ll be summarized by SOC 
and PT and in listing format.
Possible distant spread of toxin PTs will be identified in the SAP and PDSOT TEAEs will be summarized by 
PT. 
Neurological assessment TEAEs will be summarized by PT.
Vital sign measurements and 12 -lead ECG parameters will be summarized for each assessment 
timepoint, as well as for changes from baseline at each assessment timepoint.  In addition, potentially 
clinically significant vital signs values will be summarized.  Details will be provided in the SAP .
Immunogenicity results, manifested as the presence of binding antibodies (positive) and neutralizing 
antibodies (positive) to AGN -151586, will be summarized in a table for baseline and postbaseline data.  
Immunogenicity findings (positive) will be tabula ted with the number and percentage of subjects at each 
visit.  Percentages will be based on the number of treated subjects with interpretable antibody assays at 
the specified visit.  Immunogenicity results including additional analysis of antibody response to other 
neurotoxin serotypes will be documented in the CSR or in a separate report.
7.6 Overall Type I Error Control
For the double -blind period, to control the family -wise Type I error rate at 0.05 for multiplicity across 
the primary and secondary analyses, a hierarchical testing strategy11will be used.  The hierarchical 
testing strategy starts with the coprimary endpoint followed by sequential testing of the secondary 
endpoints.  The statistical significance will be evaluated in the following order: if a statistical significance 
at the 0.05 level (2 -sided) is shown for the first endpoint in the ranking order, then the next endpoint in 
the immediate subsequent order will be evaluated; evaluation of subsequent endpoint will continue in 
the same manner.  If no statistical significance is shown at α = 0.05 at any endpoint, then the endpoint 
and all subsequent endpoints will not be considered statistically significant, regardless of their nominal 
p-values.
The hierarchical testing order follows for US FDA:
1.Primary: At least a 2 -grade improvement from baseline based on the following:
Investigator and subject assessments (composite) of GL severity at maximum frown at 
Day 7.
2.Secondary: Mostly satisfied or Very satisfied on the FLSQ follow -up version Item 5 (overall 
satisfaction) for GL at Day 7

satisfaction) for GL at Hour 24
4.Secondary: Mostly satisfied or Very satisfied on the FLSQ follow -up version Item 4 (natural look) 
for GL at Day 7 
For the US FDA, the following secondary endpoints will be evaluated outside of the gated hierarchical 
testing sequence at each time point :
1.Key Secondary: At least 2 -grade improvement from baseline in GL severity at maximum frown 
according to the investigator assessment using the FWS over time (double -blind period)
2.Key Seconda ry: At least 2 -grade improvement from baseline in GL severity at maximum frown 
according to the subject assessment using the FWS over time (double -blind period).
The hierarchical testing order follows for EU regulatory agencies:
1.Coprimary: At least a 2 -grade improvement based on the following:
Subject assessment using FWS at maximum frown at Day 7, and 
Investigator assessment using FWS at maximum frown at Day 7.
2.Key Secondary: At least 20 -point improvement from baseline in FLO -11 total scores for GL at 
Day 7
3.Secondary: At least 2 -grade improvement from baseline in GL severity at maximum frown 
according to the subject assessment using the FWS at Hour 24
4.Secondary: At least 2 -grade improvement from baseline in GL severity at maximum frown 
according to the investigator assessment using the FWS at Hour 24
5.Secondary: At least 1 -grade improvement from baseline in GL severity at maximum frown 
according to the subject assessment using the FWS at Hour 24
6.Secondary: At least 1 -grade improvement from baseline in GL severity at maximum frown 
according to the investigator assessment using the FWS at Hour 24
7.Secondary: Mostly satisfied or Very satisfied on the FLSQ follow -up version Item 5 (overall 
satisfaction) for GL at Hour 24
8.Secondary: Mostly satisfied or Very satisfied on the FLSQ follow -up version Item 4 (natural look) 
for GL at Day 7 
9.Secondary: Mostly satisfied or Very satisfied on the FLSQ follow -up version Item 5 (overall 
satisfaction) over time 
10.Seco ndary: At least 4 -point improvement from baseline in FLO -11 Item 10 (look angry) for GL at 
Day 7
11.Secondary: At least 4 -point improvement from baseline in FLO -11 Item 5 (look less attractive) 
for GL at Day 7

7.7 Sample Size Determination
Approximately 600 subjects will be enrolled at approximately 38study sites. 
 
  For the US FDA and EU regulatory agencies, the ITT 
population will consist of all randomized subjects.  Additionally, for the EU regulatory agencies, 
subgroup analyses will be performed for the coprimary and key secondary endpoint with the ITT 
popul ation that also has a baseline FLO -11 total score ≤50.
For the US FDA, a sample size of 600 subjects with a 3:1 randomization ratio (AGN -151586:Placebo) will 
have > 99% power to detect a difference on Day 7 between the AGN -151586 group and the placebo 
grou p using the composite endpoint of ≥ 2-grade improvement, 
 
For the EU regulatory agencies, a sample size of 600 subjects for the ITT population will have >99% 
power (and the subgroup population of an estimated 360 subjects will provide >99% power) to detect a 
difference between the AGN -151586 group and the placebo group at Day 7 for the coprimary endpoints,

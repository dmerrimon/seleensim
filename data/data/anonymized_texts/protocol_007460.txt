 4 Prior Experience, Gaps in Cu rrent Knowledge, Rationale, and Significance  
Diagnostic error is a particularly important problem for the 500,000 elderly patients who present 
to non -trauma centers every year after trauma. Emergency medicine physicians must rapidly 
categorize patients as having minor or severe injuries based on limi ted information and decide 
whether or not to transfer the patients to a trauma center (triage). Observations from our group 
demonstrate that physicians rely on heuristics (intuitive judgments) to identify severely injured 
patients, which results in the sys tematic under -triage of the elderly. Under -triaged patients 
experience a 10 -25% increase in mortality, loss of independence, and increased pain.  
 
The absence of an effective means of recalibrating heuristics is a critical barrier to the 
improvement in outc omes for elderly patients with severe injuries. Behavioral scientists agree 
that people develop well -calibrated heuristics through an experience -feedback loop that hones 
pattern recognition and ensures the recognition of relevant contextual cues. Since rep licating 
that loop has proven challenging outside of formal training programs (e.g. residency), most 
initiatives to reduce diagnostic error have focused on eliminating the use of heuristics. 
Unfortunately, they have had limited efficacy, probably because h euristics are essential to 
human cognition. The National Academy of Medicine therefore recently identified the 
development of a method of addressing the challenge posed by heuristics to be a major priority.  
 
In prior work, we exploited insights from the be havioral science literature to develop novel 
interventions to recalibrate physician heuristics. Specifically, we identified surrogates for the 
experience -feedback loop in other domains (e.g. threat detection), and applied them to trauma 
triage (NIH Stage I  behavioral intervention development). We delivered these interventions as 
video games to increase engagement and to facilitate dissemination. In pilot trials, physicians 
who played the games made fewer diagnostic errors on a validated virtual simulation c ompared 
to those who completed a gold -standard, text -based educational program, an effect that 
persisted to six -month follow -up (Stage II development). These positive results occurred despite 
physicians reporting only moderate engagement with the intervent ions. Our overarching 
hypothesis is that by increasing engagement we can amplify the potency of the interventions. 
We therefore propose to refine the games before testing their efficacy in the real world (Stage III 
development).  
 
  
 5 Study Aims  
Deliberate practice – goal-oriented training in the presence of a coach who can provide 
personalized, immediate feedback – has successfully improved performance across multiple 
domains, including sports, music, and combat. When used in conjunction with sim ulation to 
improve surgical skill, it has a large effect on educational outcomes. It has characteristics that 
make its application in this context potentially powerful (e.g., personalized feedback/relationship 
with coach increase engagement) but also poten tially challenging (e.g. the diagnostic process 
does not lend itself easily to assessment). The objective of this R21 application is to test the 
feasibility of using deliberate practice to amplify the effect of our video game interventions. We 
will recruit  a national sample of board -certified emergency physicians (n=30) to serve as 
trainees, with members of the team (n=3) serving as coaches. Trainee -coach dyads will meet 
for 30 minutes/week for 3 weeks, by videoconferencing, to play one of the existing vide o games 
and to use it to practice pattern recognition. We aim:  
 
 
1. To assess the fidelity of intervention delivery. Approach: we will standardize coaching skill 
during an 'on -boarding session,' measure skill drift over the course of training sessions, and 
measure protocol adherence (primary outcome). Hypothesis: >90% of dyads will complete 
three training sessions.  
2. To assess the potential effect size of the intervention. Approach: we will compare 
performance of trainees (n=30) with a control group of physician s (n=30) on a validated 
virtual simulation. Hypothesis: Trainees will make ≥25% fewer diagnostic errors than control 
physicians (large effect size).  
3. To assess the acceptability of the intervention. Approach: we will conduct semi -structured 
debriefing inter views with trainees, assessing elements of the intervention that promote 
engagement.  
 
This proposal will inform a future Stage III trial to compare the effect of different interventions on 
diagnostic error in trauma triage. If successful, this program of r esearch will have an impact on 
patients by reducing the burden imposed by injury and by addressing the refractory problem of 
diagnostic error. It is novel conceptually in its effort to make heuristics a source of power, 
methodologically in its use of delib erate practice to improve diagnosis, and translationally in its 
use of video game technology. It is feasible because our multi -disciplinary team has clinical and 
behavioral science expertise, experience developing deliberate practice interventions, and a 
track record of successfully building video games that can transform physician behavior. It 
responds to two national research priorities: 1) improving the diagnostic process; 2) maintaining 
health and independent living among the aging.  
  
 6 Study Design  
Overv iew 
We will modify the interface of one of our two games to ensure its’ suitability as a training task. 
The three team members (Mohan, Elmer, Forsythe) who will serve as coaches will undergo 
training with our two deliberate practice experts (White, Arnold)  to standardize their coaching 
skills. Next, we will recruit emergency physicians working at non -trauma centers around the 
country (N=60): 30 trainees and 30 passive controls. We will pair trainees with a coach, and will 
ask coach -trainee dyads to schedule  30-minute training sessions at their convenience, once per 
week for the three week period. At the completion of the three weeks, we will ask trainees to 
complete a semi -structured, debriefing interview and a virtual simulation to assess triage 
performance . We will ask passive controls to complete the same simulation within 3 weeks of 
enrollment.  
Participants  
The three team members (Mohan, Elmer, Forsythe) will serve as coaches, and will undergo 
training with our two deliberate practice experts (White, Arno ld) to standardize their coaching 
skills.  
We will recruit emergency physicians working at non -trauma centers around the country (N=60): 
30 trainees and 30 passive controls.We plan to use participants from prior behavioral trials to 
facilitate snowball rec ruitment. We will contact prior participants and will ask them to refer us to 
1-2 colleagues who might be interested in participating in a research trial to assess physician 
decision making in trauma triage. Once we get the referrals, we will contact physi cians, provide 
details of the trial, and then once receiving consent, will randomize them to either the 
intervention or the control arm of the pilot study. To supplement our numbers, we also plan to 
reach out to ERMI, a local professional staffing organiza tion that provides emergency medicine 
physicians to non -trauma centers in the Pittsburgh region. Physicians will receive $100/hour of 
time spent participating in the trial, a wage -based honorarium.  
Inclusion criteria  
Research subjects will be board -certified physicians who work in the ED of non -trauma centers 
in the US, and who manage primarily adult patients.  
Exclusion criteria  
We will exclude physicians who work exclusively at Level I/II trauma centers, who treat only 
children, or who work ou tside of the US.  
Description of Shift with Friends  
Shift is a puzzle video game developed to recalibrate physician heuristics in trauma triage. 
Players engage in analogical encoding – structured case comparison – to derive their own 
decision principles for triage. Specifically, players review cases and the n identify contextual 
cues associated with the presentation of severely injured patients. Next, they synthesize those 
cues into simple, unifying triage principles. Theoretically, the process of derivation makes the 
principles memorable, and therefore more likely to become part of the physicians' heuristics. 
The game has approximately 2 hours of content, covers 10 triage decision principles, and 
allows repeated play of selected sections. It should lend itself well to deliberate practice 
because coaches can o bserve the contextual cues that physicians highlight during the process 
of case comparison and can provide personalized feedback on how they should integrate those 
 7 cues into the pattern that they use when diagnosing trauma patients (i.e., recalibrate their  
heuristics).  
Description of virtual simulation (used to assess efficacy)  
We previously developed and validated a virtual simulation to study physician decision making 
in trauma triage. Physicians have to evaluate and to manage ten cases over 42 minutes, 
simulating a busy eight -hour ED shift. Each case includes a 2 -D rendering of the patient, a chief 
complaint, vital signs which updates every 30 seconds, a history, and a written description of the 
physical exam. Physicians manage patients by selecting from a pre -specified list of 250 
medications, studies, and procedures. The cases end when physicians either make a 
disposition decision (admit, discharge, transfer) or the patient dies. To measure diagnostic 
performance, we will collect information on decision making: diagnostic, therapeutic, and 
disposition decisions.  
Research activities  
At the time of enrollment, we will ask both trainees and passive control physicians to complete a 
questionnaire that surveys their personal characteristics (time required: 10 m inutes). Trainees 
will be assigned a coach, and will be asked to schedule weekly 30 -minute meetings for three 
weeks, at which time they will play a video game and will receive feedback on how to use best -
practice triage decision principles (time required: 90 minutes). Trainees will also be asked to 
complete a short assessment of their coaches' performance after each session (time required: 5 
min/session). After completion of the intervention, trainees will be scheduled to participate in a 
semi -structured de briefing interview (time required: 20 minutes). Both trainees and passive -
control physicians will be asked to complete a virtual simulation that assesses their triage 
decision making (time required 42 minutes). Trainees will therefore spend 3 hours complet ing 
study tasks; passive control physicians will spend 1 hour. Trainees will receive an iPad with the 
video game pre -loaded at the time of enrollment. They will keep the iPad as their honorarium for 
participating in the study. Passive control physicians wi ll receive a $100 gift card as a fixed, 
wage -based honorarium for participating in the study. We chose to provide the honorarium to 
minimize attrition and to ensure completion of study tasks. Based on our prior experience, the 
combination of framing partic ipation as altruistic, e -mail reminders about completion of study 
tasks, and provision of a wage -based, fixed honorarium increases completion rates to as high 
as >80%. Given the costs of running a trial, and bias introduced by differential completion of 
study tasks, we believe that using an honorarium is warranted.  
Sources of data  
Physician self -report  
1. Physician characteristics. We will ask all participants to respond to a questionnaire that asks 
about personal characteristics: demographics (e.g. age, sex, race), training (e.g. name of 
medical school, name of residency training program and fellowship [if applicable], year of 
board certification), professional experience (e.g. years in practice, number of shifts 
worked/month, number of patients treated/shift) , and practice environment (e.g. trauma 
center designation of hospital; resource availability).  
2. Trainee assessment of coaching performance. After each deliberate practice session, we 
will ask trainees to rate their coaches' skill along four domains (as in the Wisconsin Surgical 
Coaching Rubric), using a Likert scale.  
 8 Trainee assessment of the acceptability of the intervention. We will ask trainees to complete the 
User Engagement Scale (a 12 -item instrument that assesses aesthetic appeal, attentional 
focus, perceived usability, and needs satisfaction). In addition, we will ask them to participate in 
a 20-minute debriefing interview in which we probe: 1) their engagement with the study tasks; 2) 
how the intervention affected their well -being (e.g., did they fi nd the experience onerous or did it 
reinforce their intrinsic motivation); 3) barriers to implementation. Interviews will be audio -taped, 
transcribed, and reviewed.  
 
Deliberate practice sessions  
We will videotape all the coaching sessions between the train ee-coach dyads. We will review 
these video tapes to assess: 1) protocol adherence (i.e. we will calculate the proportion of dyads 
that complete all three training sessions); 2) coaching performance. Two independent raters will 
review the video tapes using the Wisconsin Surgical Coaching Rubric to evaluate coaching skill 
drift. The Rubric scores performance along four domains (shares responsibility, uses 
questions/prompts to guide trainee in self -reflection, provides constructive feedback; guides 
goal settin g), with individual components summed together at the end for an overall assessment 
of skill.  
 
Shift with Friends  
The game uploads information on usage statistics (e.g. number of clicks, proportion of app 
used) to a database every time the iPad connects t o a wireless network. We will use this added 
information to determine how trainees use the games, and to calculate the number who use the 
games outside the training sessions.  
 
Virtual Simulation  
We will ask physicians to complete a virtual simulation, and will collect information on their 
decisions: diagnostic (CT scan, x -rays, labs), therapeutic (medications, procedures, consults), 
and disposition (admit, discharge). The simulation will be available on a web -based browser, 
and will store responses on a sec ure server hosted on the University of Pittsburgh network.  
Primary and secondary study endpoints  
Aim 1. To assess the fidelity of intervention delivery.  
Ha1: ≥90% of coach -trainee dyads will complete all three coaching sessions.  
We will summarize the prop ortion of coach -trainee dyads that complete all the training sessions. 
To deem the intervention delivery strategy feasible, we will need to see ≥90% protocol 
adherence. We will also summarize the characteristics of game use by each trainee, including 
wheth er any of them use the game outside the deliberate practice sessions; assessments of 
coaching performance by independent raters and by trainees; assessments made by coaches 
of intervention receipt. Finally, we will perform a series of exploratory analyses using non -
parametric tests (Fisher exact test, Wilcoxon -Mann Whitney, Kruskal Wallis, repeated measures 
regression models) to characterize the association between trainee characteristics and: a) 
protocol adherence; b) coaching skill (first session and over all); c) intervention receipt (first 
session and overall).  
 
Aim 2. To assess the potential effect size of the intervention.  
 9 Ha2: We will detect a large difference in the diagnostic errors made by trainees and control 
physicians . 
We will use the virtual simulation to assess physician diagnostic performance, and will use an 
intention -to-treat approach (i.e. all trainees regardless of whether they completed all the 
sessions will be asked to use the simulation). We will measure the proportion of seve rely injured 
patients appropriately triaged to a trauma center as per the American College of Surgeons 
guidelines. We will estimate both the group mean of diagnostic errors made by trainees and 
passive control physicians, and variability in the group -speci fic outcome. We will use a Students' 
t-test to compare the means of the two groups. To deem the intervention successful (and worth 
pursuing), we will need to detect a large difference (~25%) between the two groups. In 
exploratory analyses, we will also ass ess the effect of the intervention on heuristics by studying 
patterns of errors (as we have done previously). We will not test any mediators of efficacy 
because of the sample size.  
 
Aim 3. To assess the acceptability of the intervention.  
We will summarize  responses to the User Engagement Scale -Short Form. We will also use best 
practice methods to report qualitative results from the semi -structured interviews, focusing on 
participant perceptions of the effect of the intervention on engagement.   
Power analys is  
We will assess the feasibility of using deliberate practice to recalibrate physician heuristics 
including barriers to implementation, fidelity, acceptability, the magnitude and variance of the 
treatment effect. We anticipate that ≥80% of physicians in both  the trainee and control groups 
will complete the virtual simulation. Based on Cohen's power estimates for behavioral trials, with 
at least 20 physicians in each group, we can detect a large difference (0.80 standard deviation) 
in their performance, using a t-test, with power of 80% and alpha=0.1.73 Given the distribution 
of responses in the past, this would manifest as a 25% difference in diagnostic error.  
  
 10 Consent Process  
Process  
We will email physicians describing the study and ask if they are intereste d in participating. The 
email will include a link to a Qualtrics survey that hosts a more detailed description of the study, 
a consent form, and a demographics questionnaire. Once physicians have consented to 
participate in the trial, they will be randomiz ed to the intervention or passive control arm.  
Steps to minimize coercion  
Physicians will be given three days to respond to the email, at which point they will receive a 
reminder. Physicians who do not respond within 1 week to the recruitment email will not be 
contacted further. To minimize coercion, the Qualtrics document will emphasize that 
participation is voluntary, and consent can be withdrawn at any point during the study.  
Ongoing consent  
The study will involve multiple rounds of coaching (thre e in total), for those assigned to the 
intervention arm. The study coordinator will ensure ongoing consent when scheduling followup 
coaching sessions.  
Steps to be taken to ensure the subjects’ understanding  
We will ensure that all the documentation is pilo ted for clarity and readability prior to contacting 
trial participants. When recruiting physicians our email will specify that: 1) we are recruiting 
physicians for an NIH -funded study; 2) participation is voluntary; 3) they will receive no direct 
benefit f rom participation; 4) they will receive an honorarium for their time; 5) participation will 
require 3 hours of time, distributed over 3 weeks; 6) they may withdraw from the study at any 
time. We will also provide contact information for the PI, which they can use to gain further 
details about the trial. During the first coaching session and again during the debriefing 
interview, study personnel will confirm participant's understanding of the study and the 
requirements.  
 
 
  
 11 Electronic Data Management  
Identifiers  to be collected during any phase of the research including screening:  
• Name  
• Email address  
• Phone number  
• Location data (street address, city, county, zip code)  
• Date information (birth date)  
We will be coding participant data by removing identifiers and assigning a unique study ID/code 
to protect their identity.  We will assign trial participants an identifier at the time of randomization. 
We will use the identifier when storing and analyzing all study data. The linkage file will b e 
stored on the Pitt HSRDC virtual desktop.  
No sensitive data ( https://www.hrpo.pitt.edu/electronic -data-security ) is collected where 
disclosure of identifying information could have adverse consequences for subjects or damage 
their financial standing, employability, insurability, educational advancement, reputation or place 
them at risk for criminal or civil liability.  
 
  
 12 Data Safety and Monitoring  
Plan  
The rese arch team will meet weekly during data collection and then monthly for the remainder 
of the study period to evaluate data collection. During team meetings, we will review study 
protocols to ensure that no harms have occurred and that the benefits are as ex pected. If either 
study personnel or the coaches believe that an adverse event has occurred during data 
collection, they will report that information to the PI who will take responsibility for transmitting 
the information to the IRB and to the sponsor with in 72 hours of notification.  
Data Sharing  
To support the translation of research results into policy practice, manuscripts describing 
research results will be drafted and submitted in a timely manner for publication in widely 
circulated peer -reviewed journ als. Dr. Mohan will also present interim and final results at 
relevant academic and non -academic conferences. Raw data and derived datasets will be made 
available to external investigators and the public on a case -by-case basis, to be approved by 
the PI, D r. Mohan, and in accordance with institutional, HIPAA, state and federal regulations. A 
data-sharing agreement may be instituted, depending upon the data to be shared. All data that 
is shared will be de -identified to protect participant privacy and confide ntiality. Data and 
datasets will be retained and available to share for at least three years following completion of 
the project, in accordance with NIH regulations. The research team will track and report on the 
use, dissemination and sharing of all data and datasets and assist the PI with administration of 
data-sharing agreements as necessary.  
 
Risks and Benefits  
Foreseeable risk : breach of privacy  
Risk prevention : every effort will be made to minimize risk. The investigators and study staff 
will achieve certification as required by the IRB at the University of Pittsburgh. All physicians will 
be assigned a study identifier at the time of enrollment, and all data as sociated with that 
physician will use that identifier. Information linking the data codes with subject identities will be 
stored separately from the recorded data. At no time will we reveal subject identities in any 
description or publication of the resear ch for scientific purposes.  
There are no foreseeable risks of identifying an unexpected disease since the objective of this 
project is to educate physicians.  
Subject privacy protection : to protect participants' privacy, we will take the following steps:  
1. Coaching sessions and debriefing interviews will be conducted in private rooms  
2. We will not collect any sensitive information, since none is required for completion of the 
study aims.  
3. All study subjects will be assigned unique study identifiers that will ap pear on all data 
collection instruments, documents, and files used in the statistical analysis and manuscript 
preparation.  
4. Only limited team members will have access to personal information needed for tracking and 
informed consent. No personal information concerning study participants will be released 
without their written consent.  
 13 Foreseeable Benefits : coaching has the potential to improve physicians' performance and 
enhance their skill set.  
Subject withdrawal from study:  if physicians withdraw from the st udy after partial completion 
of the study tasks, we will analyze their residual data. In particular, understanding reasons for 
their withdrawal are extremely important for achieving the study objectives (assessing the 
feasibility of using deliberate practi ce interventions).

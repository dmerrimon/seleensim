3.0 Background 
3.1 Provide the scientific or sc holarly background, rationale, and significance of 
the research based on the exist ing literature and how it will c ontribute to 
existing knowledge.  Describe a ny gaps in current knowledge.  I nclude 
relevant preliminary findings or  prior research by the investig ator.  
Response: The treatment of type 1 diabetes is based on insulin replacement since the auto-
immune destruction of β-cells leads to a near total loss of end ogenous insulin reserve. The 
evolution of therapy in type 1 diabetes since the discovery of insulin in 1921 by Banting 
and Best has largely been based on modifications of insulin pre parations or modifications 
of the insulin molecule (insulin analogs) to allow variable bio -availability(1, 2). Different 
ways of delivering insulin and monitoring glucose through subcu taneous insulin infusion 
pumps and continuous glucose monitoring systems have also been devised. Inspite of these 
advances, the control of glucose  homeostasis in subjects with t ype 1 diabetes continues to 
be challenging since exogenous insulin cannot compensate totall y for changing 
requirements and is still not precise either in terms of the do se or the bio-availability of the 
insulin injected (3, 4). Furthermore, in the near total absence  of endogenous insulin 
secretion, the physiol ogical post prandial inhibition of glucag on secretion by the α-cell is 
probably deficient in all type 1  diabetics, which may also cont ribute to the variability and 
unpredictability of glucose control with exogenous insulin alon e(5). The concomitant use 
of metformin or pramlintide help s in some patients but the resu lts are far from consistent 
and, therefore, these agents have not made an impact on the tre atment of this condition(6). 
Thus, there is a need for therapies beyond insulin that can fur ther improve glycemic control 
and reduce fluctuations in gl ucose in these subjects.  
A recent trial of liraglutide, a glucagon like peptide (GLP)-1 analogue with a 24 hour 
duration of action, in 13 patients with type 1 diabetes led to a remarkable reduction in the 
excursions of blood glucose, both highs and lows, following mea ls and through the 24 
hours within the first 2 days of  treatment in all 13 subjects ( 7)(see preliminary data section). 
The mean glucose concentrations f ell significantly from 136 to 111 mg/dl and the mean 
HbA1c fell significantly from 6.45 to 6.1% in 8 subjects who co ntinued liraglutide for 24 
weeks. The SD of glucose readings fell from 52 to 28. Remarkabl y, the requirement of 
insulin fell from 51 units to 28 units daily. The treatment als o led to a reduction in appetite 
and to weight loss even during the short period of treatment fo r 9 weeks. The patients felt 
remarkably better and secure in terms of the ‘predictability an d stability’ of glycemic and 
appetite control (7). The improvement in glycemia with the redu ction in insulin 
requirements within days of starting treatment with liraglutide  could be an evidence of 
insulin sensitization and /or endogenous insulinogenesis. Since  C-peptide concentrations 
did not alter following the short term administration of liragl utide, it is likely that the 
suppression of glucagon may have contributed to this effect. It  is also possible that the 
improvement in glucose homeostasis could partly have been due t o a decrease in 
carbohydrate intake and reduced rate of gastric emptying, both of which are known actions 
of GLP-1 analogues (8, 9). 
 Page 9 of 47  IRB Version: JAN2016  A recent study has shown that GLP-1 infusion suppresses basal a nd arginine induced 
glucagon secretion in subjects with type 1 diabetes(10). GLP-1 infusion also completely 
prevents  the rise in post-prandi al glucose or glucagon concent rations in these patients(11). 
A study by Rother et al on the effect of exenatide after a meal  also showed a trend towards 
a reduction in the increase of g lucagon after a me al for the fi rst 45 min although there was 
no significant overall effect( 12). In view of the 24 hour durat ion of actio n of liraglutide, it 
is possible that it may exert a protracted suppressive effect o n glucagon and thus, decrease 
post prandial increases in glucag on concentrations which in tur n would reduce post 
prandial excursions of glucose. The importance of glucagon in i nducing hyperglycemia is 
further strengthened by the observation that glucagon receptor knockout mice do not 
develop diabetes inspite of complete  cell destruction by streptozotocin(13). Fasting as 
well as postprandial blood sugar co ncentrations were normal in these animals. 
Our recent observations, mentioned above and described in great er detail below, could 
provide a potentially potent and significant advance in the tre atment of type 1 diabetes if 
our investigations demonstrate that the use of liraglutide, a G LP-1 agonist, not only reduces 
glycemia but it reduces the magnitude of excursions of glucose even in stable, well 
controlled type 1 diabetics. This study will be the first rando mized controlled prospective 
double blind study inves tigating the effect of liraglutide in s uch patients. If this drug is 
shown to be consistently effective, it will provide a major adv ance in the treatment of 
hyperglycemia and unpredictable alt erations in glucose concentr ations in type 1 diabetes, 
a disease that is newly diagnosed in 15000 children per year in  the US and currently affects 
3 million Americans(14).  
Innovation rationale, and significance 
1. This will be the first prospectively randomized controlled stud y to investigate the effect 
of liraglutide on glycemic level s and variability in overweight  and obese type 1 diabetes 
treated with insulin alone. Lira glutide is the preferred agent for this study since its 
pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics ensure a duration of acti on of 24 hours. 
Hitherto, the treatment of type 1 diabetes is based on insulin replacement with novel 
analogs with appropriate pharmacodynamic profiles or with uniqu e insulin delivery 
systems. The concomitant use of metformin or pramlintide helps in some patients but 
the benefits are far from consistent and, therefore, these agen ts have not made an impact 
on the treatment of this condition(6). 
2. This will be the first study to investigate the role of glucago n and the potential basal 
and postprandial suppression of g lucagon by liraglutide in the pathogenesis and control 
of glycemia in type 1 diabetics. This is particularly important  since in the absence of 
insulin secretion from the β–cell, there is no paracrine inhibi tion of glucagon secretion 
by the α–cell. GLP-1 analogs a re known to suppress glucagon(5).  
3. With the use of CGM, this study w ill determine the rapidity of response by liraglutide, 
which in our preliminary study was observed within the first tw o days such that we 
advised patients to reduce th eir insulin doses by 25% in advanc e. 
4. This will be the first study to attempt to reduce body weight a nd other features of the 
metabolic syndrome, while improving glycemic control with addit ion of a single 
therapeutic agent in overweight and obese patients with type 1 diabetes. This is 
particularly relevant since insulin induces weight gain and 40- 50% of type 1 diabetics 
in the US have the metabolic synd rome(14). Liraglutide and the only other licensed 
drug in this class, exe natide, have been s hown not only to redu ce body weight but also 
 Page 10 of 47  IRB Version: JAN2016  to reduce systolic blood pressure plasma triglyceride and CRP c oncentrations in 
subjects with type 2 diab etes(8; 9; 15; 16; 18). 
5. Finally, it will allow us to assess whether liraglutide can act ivate the dormant β–cells 
which are known to survive in type 1 diabetics for a long time (19). An analysis in a 
subset of the study patients with detectable C-peptide will be carried out separately. 
This will assess the effect of liraglutide in preserving β–cell s and the effect of residual 
β-cell function on the action of liraglutide 
 
Liraglutide treatment in pat ients with type 1 diabetes 
As mentioned above, the treatment of 14 type 1 diabetes patient s; age (38.5 years), duration 
of diabetes (20 4 yrs), weight (66 6kg), HbA1c% (6.5 0.5%), C-peptide (< 0.10nmol/l), 
basal insulin dose of 24 6 units/day, bolus insulin dose of 22 4 units/day with liraglutide 
in addition to insulin resulted in significant reduction in fas ting and mean blood glucose 
concentrations, insulin doses by 45%, HbA1c levels even at 24 w eeks, and a reduction in 
appetite and caloric intake w ith weight loss. In addition, ther e was a reduction in the 
excursions of blood glucose concentrations, i.e., the standard deviations of blood glucose 
concentrations were markedly reduced. The changes were observed  within 48h and 
improved marginally thereafter wi th fine tuning of insulin dose s and a further reduction in 
these doses. The comparison of changes observed early (1 week) vs late (9 weeks) are 
evident in tables 1 and 2. These observations are notewor thy in that they were made in 
patients who had been well controlled, were meticulous, even ob sessive, and were on CSII 
and CGM. They had all tried hard to improve their diabetic cont rol by adjusting insulin 
doses but had not succeeded because of the induction of hypogly cemia.  To establish this 
fact, the patients recorded thei r glucose concentrations for at  least two weeks during which 
optimal control was attempted a nd no significant change was obs erved (data not shown). 
While our initial plan was to assess the effect with one week t reatment, 7 patients wanted 
to continue with Liraglutide and were able to get insurance cov erage for this treatment. 
This study was conducted to improve glycemic control in the cli nic and not as a randomized 
or placebo controlled trial. In v iew of the significant effects  that were observed (Figure 1 ), 
we now want to conduct a prospective randomized placebo control led trial to investigate 
and confirm these effects of Lir aglutide in subjects with type 1 diabetes.

4.0 Study Design 
4.1 Describe and explain the study de sign (e.g. case-control, cross -sectional, 
ethnographic, experimental, inte rventional, longitudinal, obser vational). 
Response: This investigation wil l be a prospective, randomized,  double blind, 
placebo controlled parallel de sign study conducted in patients with type 1 
diabetes. The study will be conduc ted at Diabetes–Endocrinology  Center of 
WNY, affiliated to the State Un iversity of New York at Buffalo.   
84 overweight or obese patients with type 1 diabetes on treatme nt with either 
continuous subcutaneous insulin  infusion (CSII; also known as i nsulin pump) or 
multiple (four or more) injections of insulin per day will be i ncluded in the study. 
They will be randomized into 2 groups of 42 patients each. The patients will be 
randomized to daily subcutaneous injections of placebo or lirag lutide. In view of 
the possibility of hypoglycemia and t he side effect of nausea a ll patients will be 
started on 0.6 mg of liraglutide per day. The dose will then be  titrated up to 1.8 
mg.  
 
5.0 Local Number of Subjects 
5.1 Indicate the total number of subj ects that will be enrolled or records that will 
be reviewed locally. 
Response: 84 
5.2 If applicable, indica te how many subjects you e xpect to screen to reach your

 Page 15 of 47  IRB Version: JAN2016  Response: 100-110. All screened and qualified patie nts will be enrolled and 
randomized up to 84 enrolled patients.  
5.3 Justify the feasibility of recrui ting the proposed number of el igible subjects 
within the anticipated recruitment period. For example, how man y potential 
subjects do you have access to? Wh at percentage of those potent ial subjects 
do you need to recruit? 
Response: The Diabetes and Endocrinology C enter of WNY is the largest Dia betes 
center in the WNY area, seeing between 60 and 100 type 1 diabet ic patients every month. 
Therefore, majority of recruited patients are our clinic patien ts. We do recruit a few 
patients through advertisement and researchmatch.org . These sources will suffice to 
recruit the needed number to subjects.  
6.0 Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria 
6.1 Describe the criteria that define who will be included  in your final study 
sample.

6.3 Indicate specifically whether  you will include a ny of the follo wing special 
populations in your study usi ng the checkboxes below.   
 
NOTE:  Members of special populat ions may not be targeted for e nrollment in 
your study unless you indicate this in your inclusion criteria.  
Response:  None of the below  populations will be enrolled 
☐ Adults unable to consent 
☐ Individuals who are not yet adul ts (infants, children, teenage rs) 
☐ Pregnant women 
☐ Prisoners 
6.4 Indicate whether you will include  non-English sp eaking individu als in your 
study.  Provide justification if you will exclude non-English speaking 
individuals.  
In order to meet one of the primar y ethical principles of equit able selection 
of subjects, non-English sp eaking individuals may not be routinely excluded 
from research as a matter of convenience. 
In cases where the research is of  therapeutic intent or is desi gned to 
investigate areas that would n ecessarily require certain popula tions who may 
not speak English, the researcher  is required to make efforts t o recruit and 
include non-English speaking indivi duals.  However, there are s tudies in 
which it would be reasonable to limit subjects to those who spe ak English.  
Some examples include pilot studi es, small unfunded studies wit h validated 
instruments not available in ot her languages, studies with nume rous 
questionnaires, and some non-ther apeutic studies which offer no  direct 
benefit. 
Response: We have no non-English speaking patients in this popu lation.  
We have patients that English i s a second language, but they ar e able to 
read, write and understand it.  Thi s population is less than 10 % of the total 
population.

audio/video tape.  NOTE:  You may s ubmit the wording of the adv ertisement prior 
to taping to ensure there will be no IRB-required revisions, pr ovided the IRB also 
reviews and approves the final version. 
Response: In addition to screeni ng clinical charts, participati ons will be identified 
through; flyer advertisement and researchmatch.org 
10.0 Procedures Involved 
10.1 Provide a description of all research procedures or activities  being 
performed and when they are perf ormed once a subject is screene d and 
determined to be eligible. Provide as much detail as possible.   
NOTE:  This should serve as a blueprint for your study and incl ude enough detail 
so that another investigator could pick up your protocol and re plicate the research.  
For studies that have multiple or complex visits or procedures,  consider the 
addition of a schedule of events table in in your response.  
Response:  
Screening Visit: Consent will be explained and signed. Fasting labs before 10:00 am 
include; CBC, CMP, HbA1c, lipid p anel, C-peptide and GAD-6 and a urine pregnancy 
test. Physician preformed physical and medical history, includi ng; blood pressure, height 
and weight. Blood samples of patients with negative GAD-65 anti bodies will be screened 
for islet cell antibodies, if pa tient had evidence of auto- imm unity to beta cells in the past, 
they will be retested during scr eening. Patients with no eviden ce of autoimmunity to beta 
cells will not be included in this trial.   Study Visit day -14: After screening visit, qualifying patients will see a registere d dietitian 
who will review their carbohydrate counting and diet and make a n assessment of their 
calorie and carbohydrate intake.  Then they will be seen by a CDE for instructions on 

 Page 20 of 47  IRB Version: JAN2016  injection technique and CGM inse rtion. The patients will be bli nded to CGM. Patients who 
have been using CGM prior to enrolling in the study can continu e to use their CGM’s 
(unblinded). All subjects will be advised to monitor their capi llary blood glucose by 
fingerstick before and 2 hours after each meal and to wear thei r CGM constantly for a 
week. The subjects will also be asked to keep a diary of their food intake for a week to 
measure their calorie intake. Study subjects will not change th e type of glucose meter 
during the trial. They will have their body composition measure d by DEXA and MRI prior 
to the next visit. Smoking patients will be asked not to change  their smoking habits during 
the study. S t u d y  v i s i t  d a y  - 7 :  M e a l  c h a l l e n g e  t e s t :  In order to assess the changes induced by 
liraglutide, a meal challenge will be carried out prior to and following liraglutide (week 0 
and week 26): a 910 calorie hi gh fat high carboh ydrate meal wil l be given, as i n several of 
our previous papers(20).Bolus dose will be given at 3-4 hours a fter the ingestion of the 
meal based on the blood sugar and correction factor for each in dividual subject as giving 
bolus insulin immediately before meal may confound the true eff ects of liraglutide. 
Acetaminophen (1000 mg for body weight <125lbs, 1250 mg for bod y weight 125-150 lbs, 
1500 mg for body weight 151-175 lbs and 1750 mg for body weight  >175 lbs) will be 
ingested at the beginning of t he meal, and the blood levels of acetaminophen will be 
determined at intervals for assessment of the rate of gastric e mptying. Liraglutide will be 
injected only at week 26 (45 min prior to the meal). Sequential  b lo o d  sam p les w ill b e  
obtained at 0, 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180, 210, 240 and 300 min. Samples at 15, 30, 
45, 90, 150 and 210 mi n will be 5 ml while  those at 0, 60, 120,  180, 240 and 300 min will 
be 30 ml (total volume=210 ml). B lood will be collected from an  indwelling intravenous 
canula in a superficial forearm vein.  
Study visit day -1 : Subjects will come fasting for this visit. Records of blood g lucose 
concentrations monitored by fingerstick and CGM for the previou s 14 days will be obtained 
to assess their glycemic control prior to liraglutide treatment  (this will serve as the 
baseline assessment of mean blood glucose for the study) . The subjects will have their 
24 hour blood pressure measurements completed. Brachial reactiv ity will be assessed by 
measuring by flow mediated dilation (FMD). They will undergo a meal challenge test 
(described below) and a fat biopsy. 24 hr urine will be collect ed. 
Study Visit day 0: Subjects will come fasting for this visit. Each subject will be  given one 
injection of Liraglutide 1.2 mg or placebo. A fructosamine and blood samples will be 
collected at baseline. Blood samp les will be collected after th e baseline at 30, 60, 120, 180, 
240 and 300 minutes after the injection. (This is being done to evaluate the acute effect 
of a single injection of Liraglutide on oxidative stress and in flammatory mediators, 
before any adjustments of insulin  dose or effect of Liraglutide  on blood glucose and 
weight is evident) . Subjects will be instructed by the study staff in the dosing and 
administration of the study medi cation. They will start Liraglu tide injection at a dose of 
0.6 mg per day or placebo injection on the following day. We wi ll adjust the doses of basal 
and bolus insulin to eliminate low blood sugars(less than 70 mg /dl). At all subsequent visits 
insulin doses will be titrated to target blood sugars between 7 0-180 mg/dl at all times. 
Patients will return to the center after 7 days. Study Visit week 1: Blood glucose concentrations will be reviewed. Insulin dose wil
l be 
adjusted at the discretion of the study investigator to optimiz e blood sugar control as per 
 Page 21 of 47  IRB Version: JAN2016  the targets mentioned above. Pati ents will be advised to increa se the Liraglutide dose to 
1.2 mg a day if they are able to tolerate the 0.6 mg dose. If t hey are experiencing mild 
nausea, subjects will continue with 0.6 mg daily for another 7 days. Those with severe 
nausea/vomiting will be dropped fro m the study. All other subje cts will return in 7 days.  
Study Visit week 2: Blood glucose concentrations will be reviewed. Insulin dose wil l be 
adjusted if needed. Subjects taking 0.6 mg dose and experiencin g significant nausea will 
be dropped from the study. Subjects on 1.2 mg and experiencing significant nausea will 
decrease the dose to 0.6 mg and continue that dose for the dura tion of the study. Subjects 
on 1.2mg and experiencing mild nausea will continue on 1.2 mg f or 2 more weeks. Subjects 
on Liraglutide 1.2mg daily without  any gastro-intestinal side-e ffects will be asked to 
increase the dose to 1.8 mg da ily. Study drug will be dispensed  for additional 2 weeks.  
Study Visit week 4: Subjects will be asked to bring in their used study pens and th e pen

Clinical and Laboratory Procedures  
1.Plasma glucose, glucagon, C-peptide, GLP-1, GIP and FFA measure ments:  
Glucose levels will be measured  in plasma by YSI 2300 STAT Plus  glucose analyzer 
(Yellow Springs, Ohio) (CV 2% for both intra and inter-assay). Free fatty acid levels 
will be measured by a colorimetric assay (Wako, Richmond, VA). CBC and 
comprehensive metabolic panel will be measured using well estab lished assays by the 
clinical laboratory. C-peptide will be measured with Ultrasensi tive ELISA kit  (LOD 
is 2.5 pg/ml with 3.8% and 5.8% intra and inter-assay CVs) (Mer codia, NC). GLP-1 
(8% and 7% CVs), GIP (2-6% and 3-8% CVs) and glucagon (<5% and <10% CVs) 
will be measured from samples collected in protease and DPP-IV inhibitors by ELISA 
kits form Millipore. 
2.Fat aspiration procedure:  Adipocytes will be harvested from the subjects by methods 
previously described in literatu re (21; 22). Subcutaneous fat t issue aspiration will be 
performed on abdomen at a 10 cm distance from umbilicus. The su bjects will not have 
taken aspirin or NSAIDS in the last 72 hours. If that is the ca se, then the procedure 
will not be done. The skin will fi rst be prepared with povidone -iodine (Betadine) and 
alcohol. A sterile drape will be placed around the appropriate area. 3 cc of 1% 
lidocaine will then be administer ed subcutaneously. After adequ ate anesthesia has 
been achieved, approximately 20-50cc of 0.5% lidocaine will be injected in the 
adipose tissue. Dose of lidocaine will not exceed 4.5mg/kg body  weight. Aspiration 
of fat tissue will then be performed with a 3-holed canula (Tul ip Instrumentation, 
length: 15cm, diameter: 2.1mm) fixed to a 10mL syringe. More th an one attempt at 
aspiration can be done at the same site during the procedure to  get adequate sample. 
After getting adequate fat ti ssue (500mg-3g), the puncture site  will be pressed for at 
least ten minutes before the patient rises up from supine posit ion (to minimize 
bruising). The study subjects will then be discharged home. The  adipose tissue will be 
centrifuged to remove blood and fl uid contaminants. The upper a dipose tissue will be 
collected into a separate sterile tube, washed twice with cold sterile Phosphate 
Buffered Saline (PBS) and centrifuged to remove the PBS. The ad ipose tissue sample 
will be weighed and approximately 500 mg transferred to a separ ate tube for analysis. 
Total RNA, nuclear extracts and total cell lysates will be prep ared from the adipose 
tissue. 
3.MRI and DEXA : Multislice MRI of abdomen will be obtained(23). Abdominal 
subcutaneous adipose tissue, hepatic fat and intra-abdominal ad ipose tissue (adipose 
 Page 23 of 47  IRB Version: JAN2016  tissue in the intra-abdominal cavity delineated at the innermos t aspect of the 
abdominal and oblique muscle wa lls surrounding the cavity and t he anterior aspect of 
the vertebral body. MRI images will be analyzed in a blinded fa shion using customized 
software (24).MRI measurements will be expressed as volume in c m3. All 
measurements will be done at one center, by the same machine an d using the same 
software. The coefficient of variation of MRI measured abdomina l subcutaneous fat 
is 1-2% and of visceral fat is 3-6%(25; 26).  DEXA will used to measure lean body 
mass. Adipose tissue mass will be calculated by subtracting lea n body mass from total 
body mass. Adipose tissue mass will be expressed as kilograms. All measurements 
will be done at one center and by the same machine using the sa me software. The 
within-center variability over time in measurement by DEXA of l ean mass is 0.9% 
and of fat mass is 1.2% (27). 
4.24 Hr Blood Pressure monitoring : Ambulo 2400 24-hour Ambulatory Blood Pressure 
Monitoring (ABPM) system from  Tiba Medical will be used. 
5. Brachial flow-mediated dilatation (FMD) : FMD is the capacity of blood vessels to 
respond to an increase in flow, or more precisely shear stress,  by dilating. 
Endothelium-derived nitric oxide is a principal mediator of FMD . A 7.5 – 10 MHz 
broadband multi-frequency linear array transducer will be used to acquire images. The 
subject is positioned supine with the arm in a comfortable posi tion for imaging the 
brachial artery. To create a flow stimulus, a blood pressure cu ff is placed on the 
forearm. After acquiring a baseline rest image, arterial occlus ion is created by cuff 
inflation to suprasystolic pressure. To occlude arterial inflow  for a standardized length 
of time, the cuff is inflated to at least 50 mm Hg above systol ic pressure. The resultant 
ischemia triggers dilatation of downstream resistance vessels v ia autoregulatory 
mechanisms. Following 5 minutes of occlusion, the cuff is defla ted. This results in 
reactive hyperemia (a brief high- flow state) in the brachial ar tery to accommodate the 
dilated resistance vessels. The shear stress that results cause s dilatation of the brachial 
artery. The recording of the art erial image is done continuousl y from 30 seconds 
before to 2 minutes following cuff deflation(28). This procedur e has been utilized in 
several studies carried out in our unit, including the first st udies describing 
abnormalities in African Americans(29), brachial reactivity imp rovements related to 
reversal of oxidative stress in the obese and type 2 diabetics following troglitazone(30) 
and gender differences in brachial reactivity and the effect of  hormone replacement 
therapy (HRT) in post-menopausal women(31). 
6. Questionnaires:  The 36-item short form health survey version 2(SF-36, RAND 
corporation, Santa Monica, CA) will be used to measure quality of life. Depression 
will be assessed by the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) Depr ession Measure 
(Pfizer Inc, New York, NY).(32; 33) 
7.MNC isolation: Blood samples will be collected in Na-EDTA as an anticoagulant.   
Three and a half mL of anticoagulated blood sample are carefull y layered over 3.5 mL 
of PMN medium (Cedarlane Laboratories, Hornby, ON). Samples are  centrifuged and 
at the end of the centrifugation, two bands separate out at the  top of the RBC pellet. 
The top band consists of MNC, wh ile the bottom consists of PMN.  The MNC band is 
harvested and washed twice with H ank's balanced salt solution ( HBSS). This method 
provides yields greater than 95%  pure PMN and MNC suspensions. 
 Page 24 of 47  IRB Version: JAN2016  8.NFB DNA binding activity: Nuclear NFκB DNA binding activity is measured by 
EMSA. Nuclear extract is prepare d from MNC and adipose tissue b y high salt 
extraction as described by Andrews et al (34). The specificity of the bands is 
confirmed by supershifting these bands with specific antibodies  against Rel-A (p65) 
and p50 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, CA) and by competition with cold 
oligonucleotides. DNA binding activity of NF B will be adjusted to Oct-1 DNA 
binding activity to corr ect for any variable. 
9.  Plasma concentrations of inflammatory mediators:  Concentrations of TNFα (CV: 
5.3% Intra and 8.1% inter-assay, LD: 0.1pg/ml), MMP-9 (CV: 2.2%  Intra and 7.1% 
inter-assay, LD: 0.156ng/ml), MCP-1  (CV: 5.7% Intra and 5.2% in ter-assay, LD: 
1.7pg/ml) and RANTES (CV: 3.2% Intra and 8.8% inter-assay, LD: 2.0pg/ml) are 
measured in plasma using ELISA kits (R&D Systems, MN). CRP conc entrations ( 
CV: 3.5% Intra and 5% inter-assay, LD: 0.35ng/ml) will be measu red using an ELISA 
kit from Alpha Diagnostics Intern ational Inc. (San Antonio, TX)  
10.  ROS generation measurement by chemiluminescence: Five hundred L of MNC 
(2 x 105 cells) are delivered into a Chronolog LumiAggregometer cuvette . Luminol is 
then added, followed by 1.0 L of 10 mM formylmethionyl leucinyl phenylalanine 
(fMLP). Our method (CV intra= <6% and intra= <9%),  developed independently 
is similar to that published by T osi and Hamedani (35).  
11. 15-isoprostane F 2t (also known as 8-epi-PGF2α or 8-iso-PGF2α) in urine samples 
will be measured by an ELISA kit fr om Oxford Biomedical Researc h (Oxford, MI).  
12. /g23/g5/g4/g21/g22	will	be	measured 	using	the	a	commercial 	kit	(CVs,	intra=6.4% 	and	
inter=	8.6%)	from	Zeptometrix 	(Buffalo, 	NY)	
13. Quantification of TLR-4, IκBα, TNFα, MMP-9, SOCS-3, PKC-β II, I R-β, PTP-
1B, GSK-3β IKKβ and JNK-1 mRNA, IR  and pIR   in MNC by Real-Time 
Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR):  T o t a l  R N A  i s  
isolated from MNC and adipose tissue using commercially availab le RNAqueous®-
4PCR Kit (Ambion, Austin,TX) The quality and quantity of the is olated RNA is 
determined before using the RNA. Real Time RT-PCR is performed using Cepheid 
Smart Cycler (Sunnyvale, CA) in which 2 µL cDNA, 10 µL Sybergre en Master mix 
(Qiagen, CA) along with 0.5 µL of 20 µM gene specific primers ( Life Technologies, 
MD) are used. The specificity and the size of the PCR products are tested by adding a 
melt curve at the end of the a mplifications and by running it o n a 2% agarose gel. All 
values are normalized to 18S expression. 
14. Western blotting of TLR-4, IκBα, IKKβ, IR-β, p-IR-β, JNK-1, SOC S-3, PKC-β 
II, GSK-3β and PTP-1B: MNC and adipose tiss ue total cell lysate s will be prepared 
lysis buffer. Sixty µg of total cell lysate are boiled in SDS b uffer and proteins 
separated by SDS-PAGE and then transferred to PVDF membrane. Po lyclonal or 
monoclonal antibodies against, TLR-4,IκBα, IKKβ, IR-β, p-IR-β, JNK-1, SOCS-3, 
PKC-β II, GSK-3β and PTP-1B are used and the membranes are deve loped using

Confidentiality applies to the data.   
Examples of appropriate responses include:  “participant only m eets with a study 
coordinator in a classroom setting where no one can overhear”, or “the participant 
is reminded that they are free to refuse to answer any question s that they do not feel 
comfortable answering.”   
Response: Our clinical providers involved in the study will identify pote ntial patients for 
recruitment from the Diabetes-E ndocrinology Center of WNY Clini cs according to the 
inclusions and exclusion criteri a and through advertisements. P atient who qualify will be 
asked in private during their one on one consultation time with  the physician if they wish 
to participate in the research study. If the patient agrees, th e research coordinator will 
contact them for a telephone screening privately. The patients who call for potential 
participation in the study due t o advertisement flyers will be screened over the phone 
with the research coordinator, using our telephone screening fo rm.  
When the patient is being seen at our clinics for the first tim e they sign the “Consent to 
use and disclosure of protected health information” form which clearly states that their 
protected health information (PH I) can be used for review in pr eparation for possible 
research. 
If the patient passes the telephone screening, they will be ask ed to make an appointment 
to review and sign the consent. Patient will do this in a priva te, screen off area of the 
research department and will be a llowed to discuss the consent in detail with the research 
coordinator and or study doctor. Patient will be no notified th at it is completely voluntary

17.0 Data Management and Analysis 
17.1 Describe the data analysis pla n, including any statistical proc edures.  This 
section applies to both quantitat ive and qualitative analysis.  
Response: The focus of the proposed research is to evaluate the  effect of liraglutide on 
mean HbA1c% over the period of 26 weeks of treatment. The simil arities between the 
study groups, baseline values for subject’s demographics and st udy endpoints will be 
compared using appropriate parametric tests. Transformations of  the data in order to meet 
statistical assumptions may be considered. The primary endpoint  of the study is to detect 
 Page 30 of 47  IRB Version: JAN2016  a difference in HbA1c after 26 weeks of treatment with Liraglut ide or placebo. The 
statistical analysis will be carried out using analysis of cova riance (ANCOVA) and tested 
at the 0.05 level. Change in weight will be a covariate.  The r esults will be computed as 
mean ± SD. Analysis will be carried out on the basis of intenti o n  t o  t r e a t  ( w i t h  l a s t  
observation carried forward).   The secondary end points based on glycemic changes will includ e the difference from 
baseline in mean weekly glucose concentrations, standard deviat ions of the mean weekly 
glucose concentrations, HbA1c, fructosamine, the duration of ti me spent in hyperglycemia 
(>150mg/dl, > 200mg/dl, > 250mg/dl) and hypoglycemia (< 70mg/dl , < 40mg/dl), insulin 
dosage. A reduction in the AUC following the meal will constitu te another secondary end 
point. Between groups comparisons  of the magnitude of change fr om baseline will also be 
made for these glycemia related secondary endpoints using stude nt’s t-test. Comparisons 
for these and the primary endpoints will also be made using the  paired t-test or Wilcoxson’s 
test for paired data within each group. The other secondary end-points of the study will be change from  baseline after 26 weeks 
of treatment in the fasting and postprandial blood sugars, gluc agon and C-peptide 
concentrations, indices of oxida tive and inflammatory stress in  MNC, plasma and adipose 
t i s s u e ;  s u b c u t a n e o u s  f a t  m a s s ,  h epatic fat content and visceral  f a t  m a s s ;  f e a t u r e s  o f  
metabolic syndrome; gastric emptying, blood pressure, vascular analysis, patient reported 
nausea, quality of life and depression scores. Between groups c omparisons will be made 
using students t-test or ANCOVA (a djustment will be done for ba seline differences). 
Within group comparisons for these endpoints will be made using  paired t-test or 
Wilcoxon’s test or ANCOVA. 
17.2 If applicable, provide a  power analysis.   
NOTE:  This may not apply to certain types of studies, includin g chart/records 
reviews, survey studies, or observational studies.  This questi on is asked to elicit 
whether the investigator has an  adequate sample size to achieve  the study 
objectives and justify a conclusion.  
Response: There are no prior randomized controlled trials that have examined the 
effect of Liraglutide on HbA1c in subjects with type 1 diabetes . In our observational 
study (preliminary data), we found a decrease in HbA1c of 0.35%  after 6 months of 
liraglutide in patients with type 1 diabetes who had a mean HbA 1c of 6.45±0.5%. In 
our proposed study, we will include patients with HbA1c up to 8 .5%. Thus we expect 
a greater difference in HbA1c among the two groups at the end o f the study. 
Conservatively estimating a di fference in HbA1c of 0.35% betwee n the two groups, a 
sample size of 32 patients per t reatment group should provide 8 0% power to detect a 
significant difference (  = 0.05), provided the standard deviation of the residuals is 
not greater than 0.5. Thus 64 subjects will be needed for the s tudy. To account for a 
dropout rate of 30%, we will recr uit 84 subjects into the study . 
17.3 Describe any procedures that wi ll be used for quality control o f collected 
data. 
Response: Three investigators and research nurse will double ch eck the accuracy 
of collected data. All laborato ry testing will be standardized using references and 
standards.

research procedures include procedures that present unique risk s to subjects that 
require monitoring.  Some examples include:  exercising to exer tion, or instruments 
 Page 33 of 47  IRB Version: JAN2016  that elicit suicidality or substance abuse behavior.  In such c ases, N/A is not an 
acceptable response. 
 
19.1 Describe the plan to periodically e valuate the data collected r egarding both 
harms and benefits to determine w hether subjects remain safe. 
Response: The principal investig ator Paresh Dandona, MD, PhD an d co-
investigators Husam Ghanim, PhD  and Antione Makdissi, MD will r eview the 
data every 3 months to assess th e safety of the participants. F urthermore they will 
also assess other risks incl uding the physical, psychological, social, legal and 
economic harm to these patients. T he investigators listed above  will carefully 
watch for any invasion of priv acy and breach of confidentiality . The principal 
investigator will be sharing the r esults of safety analysis of the study with the 
sponsor (JDRF) and to the IRB. The study groups will remain bli nded. If there are 
any safety concerns then co-inves tigator Husam Ghanim, PhD who is not directly 
involved with the patients and or i n insulin titrations of the study participants will 
unblind the study groups on the disc retion of principal investi gator and the team 
will assess potential harm to the patients and inform the IRB a nd sponsor of this 
potential harm. The corrective actions will then be taken and r esearch subjects 
will be withdrawn from the st udy if risks outweigh the benefits . The IRB will be 
kept well-informed at all tim es. During each patient visit, evo lution of glucose 
levels (CGM) will be conducted to reduce the risk of hypoglycem ia or 
hyperglycemia. After recruitment and completion of half of the target number of 
patients i.e. 42 patients, interim  analysis will be performed t o determine an 
overwhelming harms or benefits w ith one treatment option compar ed to another.

risks.  
NOTE:  Breach of confidentiality is always a risk for identifia ble subject data. 
 Response:   
Subjects who experience severe nausea or vomiting after startin g liraglutide will 
discontinue the study. Those with mild or moderate nausea will continue for at 
least one more week. If they con tinue to experience significant  nausea (defined as 
interfering with normal activitie s), they will discontinue the study. 
Subjects who develop pancreatitis  will be withdrawn from the st udy. 
 Page 36 of 47  IRB Version: JAN2016  Subjects who develop a new thyroid tumor during the study will be withdrawn. 
Patients will be informed that t hey should let study investigat ors know if they 
develop any swelling in the neck. 
For the entire duration of the study, the patients will maintai n a diary to record 
any hypoglycemia and other untoward s ide effects like nausea, c hanges in 
appetite and other experiences. P atients will be instructed to call the Diabetes 
Center to speak to a study invest igator directly in case of any  problem or 
untoward side effects. They will  be specifically asked to call if they have 
hypoglycemia (blood sugar <70 mg/ dl) or hyperglycemia (blood su gar >250 
mg/dl) on more than one occasion. The target blood glucose duri ng the study will 
be between 70-180mg/dl at all tim es, without increasing the inc idence of blood 
glucose < 70mg/dl.   
The following Information from the boxed warning in the package  insert 
regarding the risk of thyroid c- cell tumors will be discussed i n details with all 
participating subjects: 
"Liraglutide causes dose-depende nt and treatment-duration-depen dent thyroid C-
cell tumors at clinically relev ant exposures in both genders of  rats and mice. It is 
unknown whether Liraglutide causes thyroid C-cell tumors, inclu ding medullary 
thyroid carcinoma (MTC), in human s, as human relevance could no t be ruled out 
by clinical or nonclinical studies . Liraglutide is contraindica ted in patients with a 
personal or family history of MTC  and in patients with Multiple  Endocrine 
Neoplasia syndrome type 2 (MEN  2). Based on the findings in rod ents, 
monitoring with serum calcit onin or thyroid ultrasound was perf ormed during 
clinical trials, but this may ha ve increased the number of unne cessary thyroid 
surgeries. It is unknown whether m onitoring with serum calciton in or thyroid 
ultrasound will mitigate human ris k of thyroid C-cell tumors." 
In addition, the following FDA te xt regarding the risk of devel oping 
fibrosarcomas will be discusse d with all partic ipating subjects  
“In a 2-year repeat subcutane ous dose carcinogenicity study of liraglutide injected 
once a day in CD-1 mice, a treatme nt-related incr ease in fibros arcomas was seen 
on the dorsal skin and subcutis, the body surface used for drug  injection, in males 
in the 3 mg/kg/day group. These fib rosarcomas were attributed t o the high local 
concentration of drug near the inj ection site. The liraglutide concentration in the 
clinical formulation (6 mg/mL)  is 10 times higher than the conc entration in the 
formulation used to administer  3 mg/kg/day liraglutide to mice in the 
carcinogenicity study (0.6 mg/mL)”. 
21.2 Describe procedures performed t o lessen the probability or magn itude of 
risks, including procedures bei ng performed to monitor subjects  for safety. 
Response: For the entire durat ion of the study, the patients wi ll maintain a diary to 
record any hypoglycemia and other untoward side effects like na usea, changes in 
appetite and other experiences. P atients will be instructed to call the Diabetes 
Center to speak to a study invest igator directly in case of any  problem or untoward 
side effects. They will be speci fically asked to call if they h ave hypoglycemia 
 Page 37 of 47  IRB Version: JAN2016  (blood sugar <70 mg/dl) or hyperglycemia (blood sugar >250 mg/d l) on more than 
one occasion. Insulin doses will be titrated to target blood su gars between 70-180 
mg/dl at all times without inc reasing the incidence of blood gl ucose < 70mg/dl. 
The following Information from the boxed warning in the package  insert regarding 
the risk of thyroid c-cell tumors will be discussed in details with all participating 
subjects. 
21.3 If applicable, indicate which procedures  may have risks to the subjects that 
are currently unforeseeable. 
Response: Any adverse effects of L iraglutide that are not curre ntly known or 
those unique to their use in T ype 1 diabetes may be some of the  unforeseeable 
risks. 
21.4 If applicable, indicate which res earch procedures may have risk s to an 
embryo or fetus should the subj ect be or become pregnant.

1.0       PURPOSE  
1.1 Name and Intended Use  
The procedure used in this study is called the MyEllevate® procedure.  
 
The intended purpose of the MyEllevate® procedure used in this study is to assess the safety and 
efficacy of the procedure for soft tissue approximation and elevation of sub dermis and underlying 
muscle of the submentum & jawline.  
 
1.2 Objectives   
1. Primary Objective:  
 Safety assessment through the collection of Adverse Events. 
2. Optional Assessments: 
 Collection of digital 2-D and/or 3-D photography. 
 Photographic evaluation with correct identification of pre-treatment images when 
compared to the 30 and 90 day follow-up images performed by blinded reviewers. 
 Principle Investigator assessment using the Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale 
(PGAIS) at the 30 and 90 day follow up visit. 
 Subject assessment using the Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale (SGAIS) at the 
30 and 90 day follow up visit. 
 Subject satisfaction rates at the 30 and 90 day follow-up visit.  
 
3. Additional Safety Objectives: 
 Collection of Discomfort/Pain Scores 
 
1.3 Duration of the Investigation 
The sponsor anticipates that all subjects can be enrolled within 3  months.  If subject participates in 
all required visits, then the subject’s participation in this study may last up to 4 months. It is 
anticipated that it will take approximately 3  months to analyze the data collected during this study. 
The total duration of this study is anticipated to last approximately  10 months.  
 
2.0 PROTOCOL 
2.1 Protocol Methodology and Analysis  
Methodology: 
Subjects are to be enrolled in this clinical study if they are a healthy male or female between the 
age of 18 – 65. Up to 10  subjects will be enrolled at 2 study centers. All subjects will attend a 
screening/pre-procedure visit which may be performed on the same day as the procedure visit but 
no more than 30 days prior to their procedure. Subjects will receive a phone call 1 week (1-10 
days) after their procedure to record side effects. Subjects will return for follow up visits at 30 and 
90 days post their procedure for efficacy and side effects assessments.  
 
An unscheduled visit or phone call may be performed at any time during the study at the request of 
the subject or as deemed necessary by the site Investigator.

Analysis: 
Upcoming generations are proving to have an interest in aesthetic treatments and will drive 
demand for innovated products, procedures, and practice design.i Due to this shift in patient base, 
practices need to evolve to adapt to the newer generational ideologies. There have been rapid 
advances in minimally invasive neck rejuvenation over the past few years and using innovative 
procedure offers great promise to our aging population. The MyEllevate® procedure used for soft 
tissue approximation and elevation of sub dermis and underlying muscle of the submentum and 
jawline needs to be further investigated to collect additional data to support the safety and efficacy 
of the procedure.  
 
Relevance: 
According to the 2020 Plastic Surgery Statistics Report, neck lifts are in the top 10 cosmetic 
surgical procedures performed, with over 160,000 surgeries performed despite the average 8.1 
weeks most surgeons stopped performing elective surgical procedures for due to the COVID-19 
pandemic.ii  There was also a survey conducted by American Society of Plastic Surgeons (ASPS) 
during the pandemic which found that 11% of women surveyed indicated they are more interested 
in cosmetic plastic surgery or non-surgical procedures now than before COVID-19. iii  Currently, 
the comparable procedures and/or treatments available for visible platysma bands, glands and/or 
sagging in the submentum, jawline and/or neck include, but not limited to, NeckTite and a neck 
lift. The limitations of current products on the market include different side effect profiles and how 
invasive the procedure is. 
 
Testability: 
The MyEllevate® device, had been previously cleared for use for  use in soft tissue approximation 
and elevation of subdermis and underlying muscle. (FDA 510(k) K091061). This study will utilize 
the collection of photography and side effect data to assess the safety and efficacy of the 
procedure. 
 
Compatibility: 
Due to the increasing demand for aesthetic procedures, there is a need to treat visible platysma 
bands, glands and/or sagging in the submentum, jawline and/or neck in its earlier stages to 
optimize treatment outcomes. As a subject gets older or the condition worsens, their treatment may 
need to be more aggressive to get their body to respond the same way that a younger subject or less 
severe case may be able to respond. 
 
Predictive power: 
Although previous studies found this procedure to be effective for neck rejuvenation with few 
complicationsiv, data collection of the side effect profile of this procedure needs to be further 
investigated to confirm the safety of this approach. Assuming that there is significant 
improvement, it would be appropriate to expect results in different areas where other procedures 
and devices have significant results. 
 
2.2 Protocol Study Design 
This is a prospective, open label, multi-center clinical study to collect safety and efficacy data on 
the MyEllevate® device.

Lidocaine with epinephrine contains the preservative sodium metabisulfite which may cause 
allergic-type reactions including anaphylactic symptoms such as itching, hives, swollen areas of the 
body, and/or trouble breathing and life-threatening or less severe asthmatic episodes in certain 
susceptible people.  If the subject has a reaction, medical attention may be provided or they may need 
to seek emergency care. 
 
Adverse Events Pertaining to the Surgical Marker: 
Using surgical marker has minimal risks and may produce effects on the body such as redness or a 
rash. Markings may remain visible for a few days or may be removed with alcohol. 
 
Other Cautions: 
Incomplete response or no response may occur since some subjects may not respond to treatment.

For this study to be considered a success, the side effect profile is acceptable to the Physician as it 
relates to this type of treatment. 
 
For the additional assessments to be considered a success, the following must be true: 
 Subject satisfaction will be ≥80% 
 In cases where the subject’s improvement is being graded on a scale, such as the GAIS 
scale, we will test the statistical significance of our results against a hypothetical population 
that would have no change (average score of 4). 
 Correct identification of pre-treatment images when compared to post treatment (90 day) 
images will be ≥80%. 
 Subject diaries are collected. 
 
2.15.2 Sample Size Rationale 
Based on the need for data collected from this study, it was determined that a total of 10 subjects 
will be required, including departures. 
  
2.15.3 Patient Populations 
Interim results may be collected and reported.  All data will be analyzed at the end of the study.  
The primary analysis will be performed by the intention-to-treat approach. Everyone who begins 
the treatment is part of the study whether he or she completes the study or not. The most 
appropriate method of handling missing values will be chosen based on the individual trial goals, 
endpoints and context. 
 
The analysis of demographic, medical history, and efficacy variables will be based on all patients 
who are randomized and receive at least one treatment. The analysis of safety data will be based on 
all patients who receive at least one treatment, and have at least some safety data.  
  
2.15.4 Analysis of Demographic and Medical History Variables 
Summaries will be prepared for all important demographic and medical history variables. For 
quantitative variables summaries will include the sample size, mean, median, standard deviation, 
minimum, and maximum.  For these variables the treatment groups will be compared using either a 
t-test or a Wilcoxon Rank Sum test, as appropriate.  For categorical variables the summaries will 
include the sample size and the number and percent of patients for each outcome.  For these 
variables the treatment groups will be compared using Fisher’s Exact test.  Statistical significance 
will be declared if the two-sided p-value is < 0.05.  
  
2.15.5 Analysis of Efficacy Variables 
Additional efficacy variable is the change from baseline to Visit 4 (90 day follow up visit). 
Baseline is defined as the last assessment prior to the first treatment. The change from baseline to 
visits 3 and 4 will be analyzed using a Mixed Model Repeated Measures Analysis of Variance.  A 
pairwise treatment group comparison at visit 4 will be performed using the results of this analysis.  
If a patient has no post-baseline assessment of the primary efficacy variable it will be assumed that 
the change from baseline to visit 4 is zero.  The changes to visits 3 and 4 will be left as missing.  
Statistical significance with respect to the treatment group comparison at visit 4 will be declared if 
the two-sided p-value is < 0.05.  For each treatment group, summaries will be prepared for both the 
observed assessment and the change from baseline.  The summaries will include the sample size,

mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum.  The statistical significance of the 
mean change from baseline for each treatment group will be determined using a paired t-test. 
 
2.15.6 Analysis of Safety Variables 
Safety will be assessed through the degree of pain/discomfort related to the procedure (universal 
pain scale) and the collection of Adverse Events throughout the course of the study.  For each 
treatment group these variables will be summarized.  The summaries will include the number and 
percent of patients for each outcome.  No statistical comparisons will be performed for any of 
these variables. 
 
3.0  RISK ANALYSIS AND MANAGEMENT  
3.1 Risk Determination 
This device study used in this study does not meet the FDA definition for a Significant Risk 
Device study per 21 CFR 812.3(m).  Therefore, the sponsor determines that this is a non-
significant risk device study. 
 
Significant risk device means an investigational device that: 
(1) Is intended as an implant and presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or 
welfare of a subject; 
(2) Is purported or represented to be for a use in supporting or sustaining human life and presents a 
potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject; 
(3) Is for a use of substantial importance in diagnosing, curing, mitigating, or treating disease, or 
otherwise preventing impairment of human health and presents a potential for serious risk to the 
health, safety, or welfare of a subject; or 
(4) Otherwise presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject. 
 
3.2 Risk Management  
The Investigator in this clinical trial has been invited to participate based on his/her previous 
experience with the use of the system and/or similar systems and industry experience.  Experience 
with treatments is the most critical element in managing subject risk in this trial. 
 
In addition, as with any study, there is a risk of bias. Objective evaluation methods may be used in 
conjunction with subjective evaluation methods when feasible.  The value of the compensation to 
the clinical investigator for conducting the study is not influenced by the study outcome.  If 
photographic results are listed as the primary objective, they are to be evaluated by blinded 
evaluators who did not partake in the study.  If information concerning investigator assessment of 
improvement or investigator satisfaction is collected, then it is not listed as an objective for the study. 
 
All other known risks will be disclosed to the subject via the informed consent process. Since this 
is an elective procedure and the subjects are volunteers, it can be assumed that their signature on 
the informed consent is indicative of their agreement to accept the risks involved. 
 
The risks to the subjects who participate in this study are the same as those for the subject 
undergoing similar non-ablative radiofrequency treatment. It is possible to have an adverse 
reaction to the MyEllevate® procedure. There may be some side effects that we don’t know about 
yet.

3.3 Risk Analysis 
 
CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSED INVESTIGATION: 
Aging of the neck is characterized by a loss of skin elasticity, and is often accompanied by 
increased submental fat, ptosis of the neck, and a weakening of the platysma muscle. As a result, 
the inferior border of the mandible often loses definition, prompting patients to seek surgical 
correction. Various surgical and nonsurgical techniques have been described to lift the neck, 
including laser skin resurfacing, submental liposuction, skin tightening procedures, skin excision 
procedures, platysmaplasty, suspension sutures, and modification of the digastric muscle. More 
invasive procedures carry increased risks of complications. Therefore, minimally-invasive 
procedures of the neck represent a safer approach to address the aging process of the neck and 
deliver the desired result of restoration. 
 
ASSESSMENT OF RISKS OF THE PROPOSED INVESTIGATION: 
The risk identified with the overall clinical investigation is the integrity of the data collected. There 
are multiple clinical mitigation strategies for the risks identified. Proper training on the device and 
protocol will be performed. Data from prior investigations will be utilized to minimize side effects 
and optimize treatment outcomes. Monitoring of the study will be implemented to minimize 
subject and data risks. 
 
ASSESSMENT OF BENEFITS OF THE PROPOSED INVESTIGATION:    
The subject may or may not have improvement for the indication treated. 
 
CONSIDERATION OF PATIENT PREFERENCE INFORMATION:  
Many physicians support the use of minimally invasive cosmetic treatments in response to high 
patient satisfaction of cosmetic results with the currently available procedures and device. 
However, there is still a level of interest in novel technologies that could reduce the risk of 
complications and the need for future treatments.  
 
ASSESSMENT OF UNCERTAINTY: 
There is uncertainty of the safety profile and efficacy results with the MyEllevate® procedure. 
 
CONCLUSION: 
This device is determined to be a non-significant risk study and will be using a device cleared for use 
by the FDA.  
 
Patient population to be enrolled in this clinical study:  
Total anticipated population: 10 Subjects  
Age Range: 18 – 65 years of age  
Gender: Male or Female 
Condition: Visible platysma bands, glands and/or sagging in the submentum, jawline and/or neck.

Device Name Date of 510(k) Indication(s): 
ICLED Surgical 
Suture System 09 October 2009 
K091061 Indicated for soft tissue 
approximation and elevation 
of sub dermis and underlying 
muscle of the submentum & 
jawline 
 
 
The ImplicitCare ICLED Surgical Suture System provides a minimally invasive means of 
performing reconstructive, plastic and cosmetic surgery procedures by eliminating the need for 
extensive subdermal undermining through a large incision. Rather, the suture is guided 
subcutaneously using rigid rods like blunt-tipped needles. The ICLED Surgical Suture System, is a 
sterile, single use device kit consisting of five (5) device components: 
1.) Marking Tape: Intended to locate the marking sites of suture insertion. The backing of the 
tape is a medical acrylic adhesive 
2.) Lancet: Intended to puncture the skin at the site of suture insertion. The Lancet creates a 
perforation just large enough to pass the Suturod ™ and suture. 
3.) Clearing Device: Intended to sweep away any dermal attachments for a 360° radius around 
the skin puncture made by the Lancet.This helps prevent “dermal tethering” as the suture is passed. 
4.) Suturod™: Stainless steel, connected at the midpoint by a 100” (254 cm) length of USP 4-0 
(1.5 Metric) TEVDEK® II braided nonabsorbable polyester Suture. The suture, acquired directly 
from Teleflex, is coated with polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) for improved handling characteristics 
and to reduce “tissue drag,” and is green in color. 
5.) Light Tool (Handle): Contains an LED light source supplied by three (3) 1.55V silver oxide 
batteries, and which connects to the Suturod ™ When connected, the light created by the LED 
passed through the fiber optic light pipe within the Suturod ™ and Illuminates the distal tip. This 
permits visual verifications—through the dermis—of both the path and depth of the Suturod ™ as 
it passed through the subdermal tissue.

appropriate high-resolution digital camera. Camera settings (lighting, distance, background, 
polarization, etc.) will be reproduced at each visit, so that photographs are suitable for comparison.  
Photographs will be taken of the treatment area for study purposes.  If the subject does not wish to 
have their photographs taken, they cannot be in the study.  
 
14.0  ADVERSE REACTIONS DEFINITIONS AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS 
All adverse events that occur, starting from the time of the first treatment, will be recorded in the 
source documents and Case Report Forms (CRF). 
Adverse Events (AE) occurring will be captured and followed until the condition resolves, 
stabilizes, is otherwise explained, or the subject is lost to follow-up. Subjects will be instructed that 
they may contact the Investigator at any time throughout the course of the study. 
The Investigator and/or designated study staff will review each event and assess its relationship to 
the study device (not related, unlikely, possible, probable, and highly probable). The following 
definitions will be used for rating relationship to the MyEllevate® procedure:  
PROTOCOL #: 7053-PL01-2022       
________________________________________________________________________________ 
 
__________________________________________________________________________________________ 
 
Version 1.1: June 14, 2022  CONFIDENTIAL Page 23 of 29 
 
 Not related – The event is clearly related to other factors such as the subject’s clinical state, 
therapeutic interventions, or concomitant medications administered to the subject. 
 Unlikely – The event was most likely produced by other factors such as the subject’s clinical 
state, therapeutic interventions, or a concomitant medication administered to the subject; and 
does not follow a known response pattern to the investigational product. 
 Possible – The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the time of investigational 
product administration; and/or follows a known response pattern to the study sampling 
sessions; but could have been produced by other factors such as the subject’s clinical state, 
therapeutic interventions, or concomitant medications administered to the subject. 
 Probable – The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the time of investigational 
product administration; and follows a known response pattern to the investigational product; 
and cannot be reasonably explained by other factors such as the subject’s clinical state, 
therapeutic interventions, or concomitant medications administered to the subject. 
 Highly Probable – The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the time of 
investigational product administration; and follows a known response pattern to the 
investigational product; and cannot be reasonably explained by other factors such as the 
subject’s clinical state, therapeutic interventions, or concomitant medications administered to 
the subject; and either occurs immediately following investigational product administration, or 
improves on stopping the investigational product, or reappears on repeat exposure, or there is a 
positive reaction at the application site. 
 
Each adverse event reported will be graded on a 3-point severity. Using the following 
definitions for rating severity will be used: 
 Mild – easily tolerated, causing minimal discomfort, and not interfering with normal everyday 
activities. 
 Moderate – sufficiently discomforting and may interfere with normal everyday activities. 
 Severe – incapacitating and/or preventing normal everyday activities. 
 
A Serious Adverse Event  (SAE) is any adverse device experience that results in any of the 
following outcomes:  death, a life-threatening adverse device experience, in-patient hospitalization 
or prolongation of hospitalization, a persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or a congenital 
anomaly/birth defect. Important medical events that may or may not result in death, be life-
threatening, or require hospitalization may be considered a serious adverse device experience 
when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject or subject may 
require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition 
 
If any of the above adverse events are serious as defined by the FDA Code of Federal Regulations 
(CFR), Title 21, special procedures will be followed.  All serious adverse events will be reported 
within 24 hours of acknowledgment to the Sponsor whether or not the serious events are deemed 
sampling session-related.  All serious event reporting will adhere to 21 CFR part 812 and the IRB 
will be notified accordingly.  
   
The SAE information will be entered into the database and a desk copy of the complete SAE report 
will be submitted to the study file.

Adverse events, whether serious or non-serious, will be followed until the condition is resolved, 
stabilized, otherwise explained or the subject is lost to follow-up.  Adverse events will be captured 
throughout the study and where appropriate, medical tests and examinations will be performed to 
document the resolution of event(s). Outcomes may be classified as resolved, improved, 
unchanged, worse, fatal, unknown or lost to follow-up.  Following the resolution of any study-
associated adverse events there will be no further adverse event reports for that subject.

Confidential & Proprietary   
Version 6.0, 09  December 2020  7 For Group 3, adult CMV seropositive (+) patients awaiting kidney transplant from a CMV 
seropositive (+) or CMV seronegative ( -) living donor will be enrolled into Group 3. 
Post-transplant CMV management will follow either preemptive or prophylactic care as defined 
at study enrollment by the investigator and institutional standards.  
Patients enrolled into Group 3 should have a  kidney transplant from a living donor planned 
between 2 to 4 months after the first injection  of HB -101. Patients in Group 3 will receive HB -101 
vaccin ation (s) prior to their transplant surgery. Enrollment of Group 3 will be a minimum of  15% 
of total patients.  
Patients receiving at least 2 doses of study drug before transplant  will be included in the statistical 
analysis of the efficacy endpoints.  
The patient will complete and conclu de the study on whichever day  of the study one of the 
following events first occurs:  
• When the patient completes the study follow -up (12  months post -transplant).  
• If for some reason kidney transplant has not occurred by 12 months after the first dose of study 
drug (HB -101 or placebo).  
• If the patient experiences graft failure requiring removal of the transplanted organ or return s 
to dia lysis. 
• If the patient is withdrawn  or withdraws  from the study.  
• If the patient is lost to follow -up.  
• If the patient dies.  
The total duration of the study for each patient participatin g in the study will be approximately 
15 months.  
The dosing schedule rel ative to transplantation is listed in the table titled “ Timing of Kidney 
Transplant vs. Study Drug (HB -101 or Placebo) Injection,  Where Day 0 is the Day of First Dose 
of Study Drug .” 
Study drug is defined as either HB -101 or placebo.

*Patient s who received only 1 dose of study drug  will be excluded from the mITT  Population for efficacy analysis.  
**After Day 0 dose administration, a timeframe of ± 7 days from scheduled day of dosing is allowed.  
mITT = modified Intent -to-Treat; Day 0 = day of first dose of study drug; Day 28 = 28 days after the first dose of study drug; 
Day 34 = 34 days after the first dose of study drug; Day 35 = 35 days after the first dose of study drug; Day  56 = 56 days after 
the first dose of study drug;  Day 62 = 62 days aft er the first dose of study drug;  Day 63 = 63 days after the first dose o f study 
drug; Day  84 = 84 days after the first dose of study drug; Day  90 = 90 days after the first dose of study drug; 
Day 91 = 91 days after the first dose of study drug ; Day  120 = 120 days after the first dose of study drug.  
In brief, it is the intent of this study to administer up to 3 doses of study drug (HB -101 or placebo) 
prior to transplantation and within proximity to the time of transp lantation.  However, 2 doses of 
Hookipa Biotech GmbH  
Clinical Study Protocol H -100-002 
Confidential & Proprietary   
Version 6.0, 09  December 2020  8 study drug  before transplant  will be sufficient for the patients to be included in  the ef ficacy 
analyses if a third dose  of study drug is not feasible due to transplantation timelines. Patients will 
not receive study drug after transplantation.  
After Day 0 dose administration, the subsequent study drug administration(s) should be given 
28 days (±7 days) apart .  
Patients whose planned transplantation is less than 35 days from the planned first study drug 
(HB-101 or placebo) injection should not be enrolled.  
A minimum of 7 days ( ±2 days) must be planned between the last dose of study drug and 
transplantation , unless agreed otherwise between the sponsor and investigator on a case -by-case 
basis .  
Patients whose planned transplantation is no longer than 4 months from the time of the first study 
drug (HB -101 or placebo) injection should be enrolled . Changes in transplantation timelines will 
not result in patient withdrawal from the study. In case of delayed transplantation, a dditional study 
drug injections prior to transplantation can be discussed with the sponsor  or sponsor designee (who 
should be blinded).  The maximum allowed number of patients receiving additional study drug 
injections prior to transplantation will be capped at 10 patients (less than 10% of planned sample 
size).  
For Groups 1 and 2, i n the event that t he living donor is not available and a kidney from a CMV 
seropositive (+) deceased donor becomes available, the patient can continue in the study after 
transplantation. For Group 3, in the event that t he living donor is not available and a kidney from 
a dece ased donor becomes available, the patient can continue in the study after transplantation.  
The additional study drug booster will be administered at least 7 days ( ±2 days) prior to the 
scheduled transplantation. This allows maximal protection against CMV p rior to the transplant. 
Blood collection for immunogenicity will be performed prior to each study drug booster 
administered. Immunogenicity will not be used to determine the administration of a booster as 
these results would be unblinding; instead, reactog enicity will be reviewed and the investigator  
and sponsor may decide not to administer the booster if there is evidence of increasing reactions 
with increasing number of vaccinations. The number and timing of vaccination s versus 
transplantation will be des cribed in the descriptive analyses.  
RATIONALE:  
Cytomegalovirus  is a common opportunistic pathogen in patients who have undergone solid organ 
transplantation (SOT). The majority of recipients who are seronegative acquire primary infection 
from a seroposit ive donor organ. Viral replication in the recipient results in viremia, which  can 
progress  to end- organ disease. Active CMV infection correlates with a higher risk of other 
infections, post -transplant lymphoma, organ rejection, and overall morbidity and mo rtality. To 
prevent CMV infection and disease, transplant centers routinely employ either a prophylactic or 
preemptive strategy using ganciclovir or its oral prodrug valganciclovir. The prophylactic 
approach is effective in preventing end -organ disease whi le on anti -viral prophylaxis, but patients 
remain at  significant  risk of developing viremia and late -onset disease once prophylaxis is stopped. 
Sometimes, late -onset disease is caused by strains of CMV that have developed resistance to 
ganciclovir, which r equir es the use of more toxic second -line therapies. The p reemptive approach 
Hookipa Biotech GmbH  
Clinical Study Protocol H -100-002 
Confidential & Proprietary   
Version 6.0, 09  December 2020  9 requires  close monitoring of CMV DNAemia  via polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) and is thus 
often limi ted by practical considerations , given the need for frequent blood draws . 
An effective CMV vaccine administered prior to transplantation would overcome the limitations  
of both the prophylactic and preemptive approaches. Hookipa Biotech  GmbH (hereinafter 
Hookipa Biotech)  completed a Phase 1 healthy volunteer study (Study H -100-001) of the 
predecessor HB -101 (encoding phosphoprotein 65 kD [ pp65]  and a truncated glycoprotein B [ gB] 
of human cytomegalovirus  [HCMV ]).  
In brief, Hookipa Biotech observed:  
• Neutralizing antibodies  formed against the antigen  after 2 or 3 vaccinations.  
• A favorable safety profile.  
• CMV -neutralizing antibodies  after 3 vaccinations  on par with previous ly studied vaccines . 
• gB- and pp65 -specific T -cell immunogenicity  previously shown to correlate with prote ction 
(in adoptive  T-cell t ransfer  studies).   
Based  on this, Hookipa Biotech anticipates that the vaccine should be more  effective than previous 
vaccines tested in the SOT  setting . 
Based on the available safety data of the H -100-002 study ( data cutoff date of 03  September  2019 ) 
(see the latest Investigator’s Brochure in circulation), H-100-002 protocol amendment Version  5.0 
will include Group 3 to explore additional safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy data in CMV 
seropositive (+) patients awaiting kidney transplant from a CMV s eropositive (+) or CMV 
seronegative ( -) donor. The safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy data collected from this patient 
population will provide critical information for the registration trial based on the broad population 
of patients who are at intermedia te and high risk of developing clinically significant CMV 
infections post -transplantation.  
PATIENT ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA : 
Inclusion Criteria:  
Patients who meet all of the following inclusion criteria for their respective groups will be eligible 
to particip ate in the study:  
1. Male or female patients 18 years of age or older.  
2. Patients willing and able to give written informed consent for participation in the study.  
3. Patients must be eligible to undergo kidney transplantation from a living donor as per 
institutional standards.  
4. For Groups 1 and 2, patients must be CMV immunoglobulin G (IgG) seronegative ( -) and will 
be receiving a kidney for transplantation from donors who are CMV IgG seropositive (+). (If 
CMV IgG serology is indeterminate, repeat testing  is recommended. If the serology for the 
donor is indeterminate upon repeat testing, it should be considered positive; if the serology for 
the recipient is indeterminate upon repeat testing, it should be considered negative).  
5. For Group 3, patients must be CMV IgG seropositive (+) and will be receiving a kidney for 
transplantation from donors who are CMV IgG seropositive (+) or CMV IgG seronegative ( -).

effective contraception. This applies from the time period between signing of the informed 
consent form (ICF) and up to 12 months after the last study drug (HB -101 or placebo) inje ction 
or up to completion of the study, whichever is longer.  
Highly effective contraception methods include:  
• Total abstinence. Abstinence is acceptable only when this is in line with the preferred and 
usual lifestyle of the patient (e.g., true abstinence ). Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, 
ovulation, symptothermal, post -ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable 
methods of contraception.  
• Male or female sterilization.  
• Combination of any 2 of the following categories (Categories 1+2, 1+3, or 2+3):  
o Category 1: Use of oral, injected, or implanted hormonal methods of contraception.  
o Category 2: Placement of an intrauterine device or intrauterine system.  
o Category 3: Barrier methods of contraception: condom or occlusive cap (diaphragm or 
cervical/va ult caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/vaginal suppository. 
Note:  The use of Category 3 is only acceptable when used in combination with 
Category 1 or 2.  
8. Female patients must have a negative serum or urine human chorionic gonadotropin pregnancy 
test (urine testing limited to patients producing urine daily) prior to each dose of study drug

case-by-case basis; or be surgically or biologically sterile or post -menopausal.  
Post-menopausal females are defined as:  
• Age >50 years with amenorrhea for at least 12 months.  
• Age ≤50 years with 6 months of spontaneous amenorrhea and follicle -stimulating hormone 
level within post -menopausal range (>40 mIU/mL).  
• Permanently sterilized women (hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy).  
9. Male patients with sexual partners of childbearing potential can pa rticipate in the study if they 
agree to use barrier contraception from the time period between signing of the ICF  and through 
3 months after the last dose of study drug.

STUDY VACCINE DOSAGE  FORMS AND ROUTE OF ADMINISTRATION:  
Vaccination schedule/site of administration:  
Three intramuscular doses of HB -101 will be administered according to the administration 
schedule as per  the table titled “ Timing of Kidney Transplant vs. Study Drug (HB -101 or Placebo) 
Injection , Where Day 0 i s the Day of First Dose of Study Drug. ” 
Note that the injection site (s) can be the deltoid muscle of the  non-dominant arm (most preferred 
injection site), deltoid muscle of the dominant arm, or either thigh (least preferred injection site), 
as judged by the investigator . In circumstances when administrati on of two 0.5 mL injections are  
used, the injections should be at differ ent sites ( e.g., both shoulders), or  if at the same site,  
separated  by at least 5 cm.  
Vaccine composition/dose:  
HB-101 has been developed by the sponsor.  
HB-101 uses  replication -deficient lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (rLCMV) as a vector for a 
bivale nt recombinant vaccine against H CMV. One vector expresses the pp65 protein of H CMV,  
and one expresses a truncated  gB protein of H CMV. The 2 vectors are produced separately. The  
final drug product is manufactured by mixing 1 batch of rLCMV pp65 a nd 1 batch of rLCMV gB 
in a 1:1  ratio based on pp65-  and gB -expressing vectors. HB -101 was  produced  pre-diluted and 
ready -to-use.  
HB-101 is formulated at 1.2 × 108 focus -forming units /mL.  The product is filled in 2 mL

be presented by treatment group for Groups 1 and 2 and open- label HB-101 for Group 3 and by 
post-transplant CMV management strategy (prevention or  preemption)  for the following 
immunogenicity param eters:  
• CMV  neut 
• CMV ELISPOT pp65  
• CMV ELISPOT gB  
An exploratory objective is to assess additional immunogenicity parameters . Descriptive centra l 
statistics will be presented by treatment group for Groups 1 and 2 and open- label HB-101 for 
Group  3 and by post-transplant CMV management strategy ( prevention or preemption)  for the 
following immunogenicity parameters:  
• LCMV neutralizing antibody 
• CMV IC S pp65 
• CMV ICS gB 
• LCMV ELISPOT NP  
For purposes of the primary  objective, th e total ELISPOT gB+pp65 AND CMV -neutralizing 
antibody titers will be used. Other assays will be  used for exploratory objectives.  
Immunogenicity analyses will be performed based on t he Immunogenicity Population. 
Immunogenicity parameters will be summarized descriptively by  treatment  arm for Groups 1 and 
2 and open -label HB -101 for Group 3 and by post -transplant CMV management strategy 
(prevention or preemption) .  
The secondary objecti ves are to assess the following:  
• The efficacy of the administration of at least 2 doses of HB -101 compared to that of 
placebo in mitigating CMV DNAemia/viremia for CMV seronegative  (-) recipients 
awaiting kidney transplantation from CMV seropositive (+) do nor and followed by CMV 
preemptive therapy post -transplant  
• The efficacy of the administration of at least 2  doses of HB -101 compared to that of 
placebo in decreasing the use of anti -virals at treatment dose for CMV seronegative ( -) 
recipients awaiting kidn ey transplantation from CMV seropositive (+) donor and to be 
treated prophylactically for CMV post -transplant  
• The efficacy of the administration of at least 2 doses of HB -101 in CMV seropositive (+) 
recipients prior to transplant and followed by CMV post -transplant preemptive 
management or prophylactic anti -viral therapy  
The incidence, duration, and number of courses of CMV anti -viral therapy through 12 months 
after transplant will also be summarized descriptively.  
These objectives will be assessed by  the following endpoints:  
• Incidence and time to clinically significant CMV infection, CMV disease, and CMV syndrome  
Hookipa Biotech GmbH  
Clinical Study Protocol H -100-002 
Confidential & Proprietary   
Version 6.0, 09  December 2020  18 • Incidence and time to CMV viremia requiring anti -viral therapy  
• Incidence and duration (in days) of anti -CMV therapy courses (at therapeuti c doses) required  
• Incidence and time to quantifiable CMV DNAemia, peak CMV DNAemia level, and duration 
of CMV DNAemia above the limit of quantitation  
• Incidence and time to graft failure and organ rejection  
Demographic characteristics (age, gender, etc.) and other baseline characteristics will be tabulated 
using descriptive statistics: frequency tables, including N, n for each category, and percentage  for 
each category, will be generated for categorical variables; and mean, median, standard deviation,  
minimum, and maximum will be provided for continuous variables. Transplant characteristics will 
be summarized. These data will be tabulated for all patient s by treatment  arm for Groups 1 and 2 
and open -label HB -101 for Group 3 . 
SAMPLE SIZE DETERMINATION:  
A total sample size of  approximately 150 patients is planned for  the study . Patients in Groups 1 
and 2 will be randomized with  a 2:1  ratio for active versu s placebo. Patients in Group 3 will be 
enrolled to receive open -label HB -101. The sample size has  been set for an initial assessment of 
the safety and immunogenicity of the vaccine candidate , which will provide for approximately 
100 patients  exposed to the  HB-101 vaccine . No formal statistical assessment for sample size 
determination  has been conducted. The sample  size is considered adequate to provide the 
necessary  safety and immunogenicity data and help with the determination of point estimates of 
clinica l efficacy endpoints (clinically significant CMV infection as defined by the F ood and Drug 
Administration  “Guidance for Industry: Cytomegalovirus in Transplantation: Developing Drugs 
to Treat or Prevent Disease”) to design and adequately statistically powe r Phase 3 trials.  
SITES:  Approximately 25 to 40 global sites.

Version 6.0, 09  December 2020  28 1 INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND INFORMATION  
1.1 Background  
Human cytomegalovirus ( HCMV ), also referred to as human herpesvirus 5,  is a virus of the 
betaherpesvirinae subfamily. Infection by cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) is common and is acquired by 
contact with bodily fluids. In healthy immunocompetent subjects, primary infection typically 
presents with subclinical symptoms, though it can result in infectious mononucleosis. The primary 
infection invariably becomes latent  and can reactivate, especially during periods of immune 
suppression. According to the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data from 1999  
to 2004, the overall age -adjusted CMV seroprevalence among individuals in the United States 
aged 6 to 49 years was 50.4%.1 
In immunosuppressed transplant r ecipients, primary infection, superinfection,  or reactivation may 
cause severe disease such as pn eumonitis, retinitis, hepatitis, nephritis, and encephalitis. 
Vaccination -mediated prevention of CMV infection in  solid organ and stem cell transplant 
subjects, particularly in seronegative subjects receiving solid organ transplants from seropositive 
donor s, and in seropositive stem cell transplant recipients, represents a significant medical need.  
Immunity acquired through natural infection helps contain CMV in a latent state and reduces the 
clinical consequences of re- infections and reactivations. Neutra lizing antibodies against the virus 
contribute to protection. This has been demonstrated by protection of the f etus by transplacental 
maternal antibo dies and by pas sive transfer of immunoglobulin- containing CMV antibodies to 
transplant subjects. The effect  of passive immunoglobulin in prevention of congenital infection 
and resulting disease remains less clear and is still under investigation. T -cell-mediated immunity 
has been shown to also prevent reactivation and to aid in recovery from CMV infection, with  
multiple supporting lines of evidence, including a doptive transfer of cytotoxic T -cells to transplant 
recipients .2 
There is currently no commercial ly available  vaccine against CMV, though multiple vaccine 
candidates are in clinical development. Most candidate vaccines  incorporate variations of the 
HCMV glycoprotein B ( [gB], encoded by UL55) to induce virus -neutralizing antibodies. 
Glycoprot ein B is often combined with  phosphoprotein 65 kD ( [pp65] , encoded by UL83) as a key 
target of cellular immunity. The potential utility of gB and pp65 as H CMV vaccine antigens can 
be inferred from the natural history of infection. Neutralizing a ntibodies specifi c for gB3,4 and 
cluster of differentiat ion ( CD) 8+ cytotoxic T  lymphocytes specific for pp655 have been isolated 
from subjects following H CMV infection. Furthermore, pp65- specific T -cells isolated from donors 
can be transferred to hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients, resulting in clearance of H CMV 
infection or a reduction of viral load.6  
The utility of  gB and pp65 as monovalent H CMV vaccine antigens was demonstrated in previous 
clinical  studies . A canarypox vector expressing full length gB was well tolerated but evidenced 
only limited immunogenicity .7 A subunit protein gB formulated with MF59 adjuvant was safe, 
well tolerated, immunogenic, and showed signs of moderate clinical efficacy in post -partum 
women and in solid organ transplant recipients .8,9,10 A second subunit protein gB vaccine 
formulated with a different adjuvant has completed a safety and immunogenicity study, but the results  have not yet been reported.
11 A canarypox vector expressing full -length pp65 was safe and 
immunogenic ,12 but was not fur ther pursued. An adjuvanted human leukocyte antigen 
(HLA )-A* 0201- restricted pp65 peptide vaccine was well tolerated, immunogenic, and

Confidential & Proprietary   
Version 6.0, 09  December 2020  29 significantly reduced mortality and viremia in stem cell transplant recipients with hematolog ical 
illnesses .13 It is noteworthy that this vaccine induced significant adverse re actions in healthy 
subjects .14 Moreover, pp65 is 1  of 3 antigens expressed in a modified vaccinia Ankara -vectored 
vaccine candidate that recently completed a Phase 1 safety and immunogenicity study in healthy 
adults .15 
Two multivalent vaccine candidates expressing gB and pp65 have been evaluated in the clinic. A 
deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) vaccine containing 2 plasmids expre ssing a truncated version of gB  
in combination with  a mutated  pp65 was well toler ated and safe in hematopoietic stem cell 
transplant recipients .16,17 The immunogenicity data suggested that the vaccine functioned primarily  
through pp65- specific T -cells. In the stem cell recipient population, the vaccine appeared to lower 
the viral load but did not reduce the need for anti -viral therapy. A non- replicating alphavirus 
replicon particle vaccine expressing a truncated isoform of gB and a pp65- IE1 fusion protein was 
safe, well tolerated, and immunogenic in a Phase 1 study but has not, to this date, been developed further .
18 
Different forms of the gB and pp65 antigens have been used in clinical studies  without safety 
concerns surfacing (except the adjuvanted pp65 pepti de vaccine in healthy subjects) .14 These  
proteins are immunogenic in humans  and a bivalent  vaccine eliciting strong humoral  immune 
responses to gB and robust cellular immunity to pp65 would act syner gistically to benefit 
vaccinees.  
1.1.1 Lymphocytic Choriomeningitis Virus  
Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) is the prototype member of  the arenavirus family. 
It is an enveloped, bisegmented negative single -strand ribonucleic acid (RNA) virus with an 
ambisense coding strategy. The genome codes for 4 proteins: the surface glycoprotein (GP), the 
nucleoprotein (NP), the RNA -dependent RNA pol ymerase L, and a zinc finger protein Z. 
Lymphocytic choriomeningitis  virus  particles are pleomorphic, with a mean diameter of 
approximately 110 to 130 nm.  
Lymphocytic choriomeningitis is a rodent -borne infectious disease that presents as aseptic 
meningitis, encephalitis , or meningoencephalitis. The disease is caused by the LCMV . The natural 
host of LCMV is the mouse, though it can infect other rodents, or accidentally ( albeit rarely ) be 
transmitted to primates and humans. It is a rare human pathogen , and, with the rare exception of 
vertical transmission and transplant -associated transmission, there are,  to Hookipa Biotech 
GmbH’s (hereinafter Hookipa Biotech)  knowledge , no doc umented cases  of human- to-human  
transmission. In humans , LCMV can cause a variety of symptoms from malaise to meningitis, 
though postnatal subjects nearly always recover without sequelae. Congenital infection more 
frequently results in clinical disease .19 Seroprevalence in humans is very low in most geographic 
regions and does not  exceed  5% of the human population.20 
An acute infection in adult mice is controlled by a vigorous cellular immune response. In contrast, 
virus -neutralizing serum activity is undetectable, or found only late after virus control . The 
majority of the antibody response targets the NP  but does not neutralize the virus. Lym phocytic 
choriomeningitis virus -neutralizing antibodies are direc ted against the only surface GP  of the 
virus .21

Version 6.0, 09  December 2020  30 1.1.2 Replication -Deficient Lymphocytic Choriomeningitis Virus Vectors  
Non-replicating viral vectors of LCMV have been constructed by deletion of the GP protein and 
insertion of foreign genes, including model antigens ( e.g., ovalbum in) and microbial antigens from  
mycobacterium tuberculosis, vesicular stomatitis virus, simian immunodeficiency virus, and 
influenza virus. These recombinant, non- propagating vectors ha ve been studied in mice and 
non-human primates and have been shown to induce potent humor al and cellular immunity .22,23 
As a replication -deficient vector, replication -deficient lymphocytic choriomeningitis 
virus  (rLCMV ) has the following features of interest for vaccine applications:  
• Safety: The non- replicating virus is anticipated to infect target cells in the vaccine, replicate 
the genomic RNA , and express the foreign antigen, but not produce infectious virus due to  
absence of the essential GP  gene in the vector genome. Thus, this vector is - propagation 
deficient  in any cell, except engineered production cell lines. Because of this safety profile, it 
has the potential to be used in healthy subjects of all ages, as well as in persons with underlying health conditions.  
• Immunogenicity: In animal models, non- replicating rLCMV vectors that express foreign 
antigens induce strong functional antibodies against these antigens. The humoral response is 
combined with potent cytotoxic CD8+ T -cell responses, owing to intracellular processing of 
endogenously synthesized proteins and direct presentation via the major histocompatibility 
complex class 1 pathway.  
• Utility: Successive homologous boosts should be possible because of a low prevalence of 
pre-existing immunity to LCMV in the human population, and no to low virus -neutralizing 
immune response induced by the vector.  
1.2 Rationale  
Cytomegalovirus is a common opportunistic pathogen in patients who have undergone solid organ 
transplantation (SOT). The majority of recipients who are seronegative acquire primary in fection 
from a seropositive donor organ. Viral replication in the recipient results in viremia, 
which  can progress  to end- organ disease. Active CMV infection correlates with a higher risk of 
other infections, post -transplant lymphoma, organ rejection, and overall morbidity and mortality. 
To prevent CMV infection and disease, transplant centers routinely employ either a prophylactic 
or preemptive strategy using ganciclovir or its oral prodrug valganciclovir. The prophylactic 
approach is effective in preventing end -organ disease while on anti -viral pro phylaxis, but patients 
remain at significant risk of developing viremi a and late- onset disease once prophylaxis is stopped. 
Sometimes, late -onset disease is caused by strains of CMV that have developed resistance to 
ganciclovir, which requires the use of mor e toxic second- line therapies. The p reemptive approach 
requires  close monitoring of CMV DNAemia  via polymerase chain reaction  (PCR)  
and is thus often limited  by practical considerations , given the need for frequent blood draws .  
An effective CMV vaccine administered prior to transplantation would overcome the limitations  
of both the prophylactic and preempti ve approaches. Hookipa Biotech completed a  Phase 1 healthy 
volunteer study (Study H -100-001) of the predecessor HB -101 (encoding pp65 and a truncated gB  
of HCMV) .  
Hookipa Biotech GmbH  
Clinical Study Protocol H -100-002 
Confidential & Proprietary   
Version 6.0, 09  December 2020  31 In brief, Hookipa  Biotech observed:  
• Neutralizing antibodies  formed against the antigen  after 2 or 3 vaccinations.  
• A favorable safety profile.   
• CMV -neutralizing antibodies  after 3 vaccinations  on par  with previous ly studied vaccines . 
• gB- and pp65- specific T -cell immunoge nicity  previously shown to correlate  with protection 
(in adoptive  T-cell transfer  studies).   
Based  on this, Hookipa Biotech anticipates that the vaccine should be more  effective than previous 
vaccines tested in the SOT setting . 
1.2.1 Rationale for Including Cytomegalovirus Seropositive Kidney Transplant Recipients  
Based on the available safety data of the H -100-002 study (data cutoff date of 03 September  2019)  
(see the latest Investigator’s Brochure in circulation) , H-100-002 protocol amendment Version  5.0 
will include Group 3 to explore additi onal safety , immunogenicity, and efficacy  data in CMV 
seropositive (+) patients awaiting kidney transplant from a CMV seropositive (+) or CMV 
seronegative ( -) donor. The safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy data collected from this patient 
population will provide critical information for the registration trial based on the broad population of patients who are at intermediate and high risk of developing clinically significant CMV infections -post transplantation.  
1.3 Risk/Benefit   
Cytomegalovirus  is an important  pathogen for women of childbearing age  and for allograft 
recipients, 2 populations in which development of a vaccine has been rated as a high priority. The 
life-long latency and ability to re -infect despite pre- existing natural immunity make the p roduction 
of a vaccine against CMV challenging.
10 
In a se tting that lacked an effective CMV vaccine, alternative strategies were devised to reduce the 
risk of CMV infection and disease. Hand and environmental  hygiene is an essential part of  every 
infection control program and could reduce the transmission rate of CMV. Infection by CMV in 
the first 3 years of life is followed by vir al excretion in urine and saliva for  up to 42  months. 
Accordingly, CMV  seronegative (-) mothers of CMV -infected children are at 20%  to 25% higher 
risk of primary CMV infection compared with CMV  seronegative  (-) mothers of uninfected 
children and become inf ected with a probability of at least 50% within 1 year after the child 
acquires the infection .24 
The success of SOT and hematopoetic stem cell trans plantations adds another growing group of 
patients at risk of C MV disease. In particular, CMV  seronegative (-) transplant recipients  who 
receive graft from a CMV  seropositive (+) donor  are at a high risk of severe CMV disease. In the 
allograft recipient, v iremic dissemination can cause end -organ disease, such as hepatitis, 
pneumonitis, gastroenteritis, and retinitis, and can predispose to transplant re jection.10 Anti-viral 
prophylactic strategies are limited by toxicities, drug -drug intera ctions, and development of 
anti-viral resistance.25  
Patients enrolled in this study will be vaccinated while they await transplantation and are not 
currently receiving immunosuppression, per Exclusion Criteria 5, 8, and 9. The minim um time 
between vaccination and transplantation will be 7 days ( ±2 days) per study protocol.  
Hookipa Biotech GmbH  
Clinical Study Protocol H -100-002 
Confidential & Proprietary   
Version 6.0, 09  December 2020  32 The recombinant vaccine used in this study is replication- deficient. The non- replicating virus 
infects target cells (e.g., dendritic cells), where it replicates the genomic RNA and expresses  the 
foreign antigen , but does not produce infectious virus due to absence of the essential GP gene in 
the vector genome. Thus, this vector is propagation- deficient and as such has the potential to be 
used in healthy subjects of all ages, as well as in per sons with underlying health conditions.  
In animal studies performed in mice, Hookipa Biotech has demonstrated that the vector 
administered via all routes, including dedicated intracranial route administration, causes no 
pathology (including in the brain, which is devoid of resident immune defense). Biodistribution 
studies in immunocompetent mice indicated that the vector material can be found in multiple 
tissues after immunization, but was not associated with pathologic sequelae in any tissues 56 to 
90 days after inoculation. In addition, toxicity studies in rats supplement these safety data. 
Research studies using analogous vectors (encoding different antigens) were performed in guinea pigs, rabbits, and non- human primates and no apparent toxicities were observed in any of these 
studies.  
Furthermore, HB -101 was well  tolerated in healthy adults in the Phase 1 clinical trial. No severe 
adverse reactions or possible severe adverse reactions to HB -101 have been reported. In sum, the 
risks to patients from HB -101 administration are considered low, while the benefits could include 
the prevention of CMV infection and disease in solid organ transplant patients.  
Patients enrolled in the study will receive the standard of care CMV management post -transplant 
that the y would have received outside of the clinical trial and are not put at increased risk of 
developing clinically significant CMV infection.  
The immune  memory cells will be responsible for the mounting of an anamnestic response should 
the subject be exposed to the CMV antigen after transplantation (in case of CMV primary infection 
from the graft or the environment). This was observed in 1 of the healthy volunteers who developed 
a strong immune response as a result of a primary infection after a decrease in the circulating CD4 and CD8 populations.  
The inclusion of recipients with indeterminate CMV immunoglobulin titers is based on the curr ent 
international guidelines for the management of CMV infection post -transplantation as defined by 
Kotton et al (Transplantation 2018).
26 Indeterminate  titers are not unknown titers of anti -CMV 
immunoglobulin, they are low -level titers that can result from a waning immunity or passive 
immunity (i .e., in recipients after transfusion). For the purpose of the most conservative 
management of CMV risk after t ransplant, recipients with an indeterminate result for CMV 
serology are assumed to be negative (if any active immunity exists, it is weak) and indeterminate 
results for donor are assumed to be positive (while immunity might be old, the graft may still be 
infected by latent CMV infection).  
1.3.1 Risks  
The risks to which subjects could be exposed in the clinical development  program can be separated  
into 2 categories: those typical of administration of a vaccine and its route of delivery,  and those 
possibly related to the administration of predecessor HB -101 or HB -101 in particular . Predecessor 
HB-101 and HB -101-specific risks are the vector, the antigens, the formulation, and the mode of 
action.  
At the time of the writing of this protocol amendment, no serious adverse reaction (i.e., 
drug- related serious adverse event [SAE]) has been reported ; therefore , no events are considered

Version 6.0, 09  December 2020  33 expected. However , for a cu rrent list of expected adverse reactions, the i nvestigator should refer 
to the most up- to-date version of the Investigator’s Brochure.  
1.3.1.1  Risks related to administration of vaccine  
Possible risks that are frequently associated with intramuscular vaccination include the occurrence 
of local reactions such as edema, induration and erythema, transient local pain, and reddening or 
tenderness at the injection site. Other adverse effects could include mild to moderate headache, 
myalgia, flu -like symptoms, malaise, o r fatigue (as documented for commercial vaccines [EPAR 
FLUARIX, 2015; EPAR HAVRIX, 2015]).  
Any vaccine could cause allergic and anaphylactic reactions, in addition to the described local reactions at the vaccination site, and systemic flu -like reactions.  
Needles during blood sampling could cause local reactions such as edema.   
There is a possible risk of sensitization (donor sensitization  and increased HLA sensitization) 
prior to transplantation . The sensitization risk can be mitigated by considering the patients ’ HLA 
genotype s (see Exclusion Criteria, below). It has been reported that as many of 4% of dialysis 
patients awaiting kidney transplantation become sensitized.
28  Other  clinical studies have shown 
that this risk of sensitization following vaccination may be as high as 7.5%.  29 
1.3.1.2  Specific risks related to p redecessor HB -101 and HB -101 
Vector 
Lymphocytic choriomeningitis is a rodent -borne infectious disease that presents as aseptic 
meningitis, encephalitis, or meningoencephalitis. The disease is caused by the LCMV. Central 
nervous syste m involvement in the form of aseptic meningitis or meningoencephalitis represents 
a rare complication and resolves without sequelae. The natural host of LCMV is the mouse, though  
it can infect other rodents, or accidentally (albeit rarely) be transmitted to primates  and humans. It 
is a rare human pathogen, and with the rare exception of  vertical  transmission  and 
transplant -associated transmission, there are, to Hookipa Biotech’s  knowledge,  no documented 
cases  of human to human  transmission. In humans, LCMV  can cause a variety of  symptoms from 
malaise to meningitis, though postnatal subjects nearly always  recover  without sequelae. Hookipa 
Biotech has developed a rLCMV vector platform.  
The risk presented by the vector is pathogenicity in the vacci ne recipient. The primary mitigation 
is the deletion of the essential GP  from the genome, which makes the vector unable to propagate 
outside of engineered packaging cell lines. Therefore, infection of the individual target cell is a 
self-limiting event and  the number of cells affected correlates with the dose administered.  
The vector has no theoretical risk of forming replication -competent virus ( RCV ). This was 
accomplished by designing the vectors with no sequence homology between the vector and the GP  
gene in the trans -complementing production ce ll line. This eliminates the chance of  
gain-of-function genetic rearrangements. Furthermore, during the manufacture of predecessor 
HB-101 and HB -101, the lack of RCV was demonstrated in vitro for the master seed vi ruses and 
bulk drug subs tances. Finally, 3  biosafety studies in mice using research grade material comparable 
to vaccine demonstrated that injection of large doses of the vector into the brain or peritoneum of 
immune -compromised mice failed to produce pathology or infectious virus titers in the animals. 
Hookipa Biotech GmbH  
Clinical Study Protocol H -100-002 
Confidential & Proprietary   
Version 6.0, 09  December 2020  34 Therefore, the design and testing of the vectors mitigate the risk of replicating vectors.  Clinical 
data showed no signs or symptoms of systemic disease.  
During the passive phase of Study H -100-001 (Month 4 + 1 day of the first subject from Cohort 1, 
to the Month 12 visit for the last subject from Cohort 3), it was noted that, owing to a strong 
increase of humoral and cellular immunity to HCMV after the conclusion of the active phase of 
the study, a primary H CMV infection was suspected in 1 subject  in Cohort 2 before Month 6. The 
subject did not report any symptoms.  
During Study H -100-001, 1 subject (7%) developed a neutralizing antibody response during the 
study against the vector after 3 administrations of t he high dose, which returned to baseline at 
Month 12.  
Antigens  
The 2 antigens, pp65 and gB, are derived from HCMV, a relatively benign pathogen for healthy 
adults. Antigen gB is the viral fusion protein that promotes fusion of the HCMV envelope with the target cell membrane and pp65 is a phosphoprotein with kinase activity that has been shown to 
interfere with innate immune -signaling pathways in HCMV -infected cells. Predecessor HB -101 
and HB -101 expressed a truncated isoform of gB that is lacking the long cytoplasmic tail and an 
unmodified isoform of pp65. Various isoforms of both antigens, including isoforms similar to those expressed by predecessor HB -101 and HB -101, have been used in previous clinical studies 
of candida te HCMV vaccines without safety  concerns.  
Formulation  
Predecessor HB -101 (t he H B-101 product used in clinical Study H -100-001) contained a 1:1 ratio 
of HCMV gB- and HCMV pp65- expressing infectious particles  with a combined titer of 
5.14 × 10
8 focus-forming units (FFU)/mL formulated in 10 mM HEPES, 1 50 mM sodium chloride 
(NaCl ), 20 mM glycine, 0.1%  (w/v) poloxamer 188, 2 % (w/v) recombinant hum an serum albumin 
(rHSA), pH 7.4.  
In the current  Phase 2 clinical study, HB -101 was pr oduced by mixing HCMV  gB- and HCMV  
pp65- expressing infectious particles in a 1:1 ratio followed by a 2.6- fold dilution in 10 mM 
HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, 20 mM glycine, pH 7.4. Therefore, the Phase 2 HB -101 is formulate d 
with a combined titer of 1.2 ×  108 FFU/mL in 10 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, 20  mM glycine, 
0.8% (w/v) rHSA, 0.04% (w/v) poloxamer 188, pH 7.4.  Each 1.0 mL dose delivers 1.2  × 108 FFU, 
2.4 mg HEPES, 8.8 mg NaCl, 1.5 mg glycine, 0.4 mg poloxamer 188 , and 8.0  mg rHSA.  
None of the components of either predecessor HB -101 or current HB-101 are an ticipated to pose 
a risk to the recipients. Poloxamer 188 and rHSA are used in other licensed or investigational 
medicinal products.  
Mode of action  
The vectors infect target cells in the vaccine recipient, replicate the genome,  and express the 
encoded vec tor proteins and vaccine antigens, which are presented to B - and T -cells to elicit an 
immune response. The antigens have been tested in other clinical trials  without signs of 
immunopathology. The non- replicating nature of the vector li mits the amount and d uration of  
vector -specific antigen expression and reduces the risk of immunopathology caused by vector  
proteins. Animal studies have not indicated any adverse effects due to the mode of action.  
Hookipa Biotech GmbH  
Clinical Study Protocol H -100-002 
Confidential & Proprietary   
Version 6.0, 09  December 2020  35 Diagnostic sensitivity  
Because the vaccine contains genetic sequences of CMV and CMV PCR is used to monitor patients 
for CMV infection post -transplantation, the CMV PCR assays at each site will be reviewed to 
ensure the primer for the PCR assay does not overlap with the vaccine genetic sequences. This will 
eliminate the risk of false positive PCR results related to the administration of the vaccine.  
1.3.2 Benefits  
HB-101 is being develop ed to prevent CMV infection. The  target populations  of the clinical 
development program of HB -101 are adolescent girls,  pre-pregnant women, and recipients of SOT 
or hematopoietic stem cell transplants.  
Non-clinical data demonstrate that  predecessor  HB-101 is safe and elicits humoral and cellular 
immune respons es against gB and pp65. Predecessor  HB-101 has bee n tested in immunogenicity 
mode ls in mice and rabbits for immunogenicity and in female guinea pigs for immunogenicity and 
efficacy. These animal studies have demonstrated that predecessor HB -101 induces strong 
humoral and cellular immune res ponses against gB and pp65 and sero- neutralization against 
HCMV. The guinea pig congenital guinea pig CMV  infection model demonstrated that vaccination 
of female guinea pigs with predecessor HB -101 followed by  mating, gestation, and  challenge with 
CMV prot ected pups against mortality.  
Study H -100-001 assessed the safety and  immunogenicity of predecessor HB -101 in healthy 
subjects serologically negative for HCMV .  
In brief,  Hookipa Biotech observed:  
• Neutralizing antibodies  formed against the  antigen  after 2 or 3 vaccinations.  
• A favorable safety  profile.  
• CMV -neutralizing antibodies  after 3 vaccinations  on par with  previous ly studied vaccines . 
•  gB- and pp65- specific T -cell immunogenicity  previously shown to correlate with protection 
(in adoptive  T-cell transfer  studies).  
Based  on this, Hookipa Biotech anticipate s that the vaccine should be more  effective than previous 
vaccines tested in the SOT setting .  
Safety data from Study H -100-001 indicate a favorable tolerability profile from the vaccine with 
side effects  typically  limited to headache, influenza- like illness, myalgia, upper respiratory tract 
infections, and gastroenteritis.  
Although the proposed populations for the  HB-101 clinical development program  include  
adolescent girls and recipients of solid  organ  or hematopoietic stem cells, to date, no specific 
studies  have been conducted to determine  the effect  of HB -101 in pediatric subjects  or recipients 
of hematopoietic stem cells.  Such studies will be planned in the future.  
The population of Study H -100-002 is a subset of recipients of SOT . Immunogenicity results of 
Study H-100-001 support that levels of protective immunity could be reached and could protect 
from clinically significant CMV infections , defined as the occurrence of either CMV end -organ 
disease , or initiation of anti- CMV pre emptive therapy based on documented CMV viremia and the 
clinical condition of the patient , post -transplantation .

3.1 Summary of Study Design 
This is a Phase 2 study of HB -101, a bivalent CMV vaccine,  in patients  awaiting kidney 
transplantation and includes a randomized, placebo -controlled portion (Groups 1 and 2) and an 
open- label portion (Group 3) . Approximately 150 patients recruited globally from specified 
transplant centers w ill be enrolled . The study will occur at approximately  25 to 40 global  sites.  
A high- level study schematic  of Study H -100-002 is presented in  Figure 1.

CMV = cytomegalovirus; D+ = donor seropositive for CMV; D - = donor seronegative for CMV; R+ = recipient 
seropositive for CMV; R- = recipient seronegative for CMV.   
For Groups 1 and 2, a dult CMV  seronegative  (-) patients awaiting  kidney transplant from  a CMV  
seropositive  (+) living donor will be enrolled according to treatment intent with regard to t he 
method of CMV prevention after transplant (either preemptive or pr ophylactic) as defined at study 
enrollment by the investigator  and institutional standards.  
Patients  enrolled into Groups 1 and 2 should have a living donor kidney transplantation ideally 
planned between 2 to 4 months  after the first injection of study drug (HB -101 or placebo) .  
• Group 1 -  The preemptive group will be randomized in a 2:1 ra tio (HB-101:placebo)  to receive 
either HB -101 or placebo  before transplant . Post -transplant patients will be monitored per 
preemptive institutional standards.  
• Group 2 -  The prophylactic group will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio  (HB-101:placebo)  to 
receive either HB -101 or placebo  before transplant . Post -transplant patients will receive 3  to 
6 months of anti -viral prophylaxis  following institutional standards.  
Enrollment of Group 2 will be limited to no more than 54% of total patients.  
For Group 3, a dult CMV seropositive (+ ) patients awaiting kidney transplant from a CMV 
seropositive (+) or CMV seronegative ( -) living donor will be enrolled into Group 3. 
Post-transplant CMV management will follow either preemptive or prophylactic care as defined 
at study enrollment by the investigator and institutional standards.

Version 6.0, 09  December 2020  38 Patients enrolled into Group 3 should have a kidney transplant ation  from a living donor planned 
between 2 to 4 months after the first injection of HB -101. Patients in Group 3  will receive HB -101 
vaccin ation (s) prior to their transplant surgery. Enrollment of Group 3 will be a minimum of 15% 
of total patients.  
Patients receiving at least 2 doses of study drug before transplant will be included in the statistical 
analysis of the efficacy endpoints.  
The total duration of  the study for each patient participatin g in the study will be approximately 
15 months.  
The dosing schedule relative to transplantation is listed in Table 2.  
Study drug is defined as either HB -101 or placebo.

*Patient s who received only 1 dose of study drug  will be excluded from the mITT Population for efficacy analysis.  
**After Day 0 dose administration, a timeframe of ± 7 days from scheduled day of dosing is allowed.  
mITT = modified Intent -to-Treat; Day 0 = day of first dose of study drug; Day 28 = 28 days after the first dose of study drug; 
Day 34 = 34 days after the fir st dose of study drug; Day 35 = 35 days after the first dose of study drug; Day  56 = 56 days afte r 
the first dose of study drug; Day 62 = 62 days after the first dose of study drug; Day 63 = 63 days after the first dose of study 
drug; Day  84 = 84 days afte r the first dose of study drug; Day  90 = 90 days after the first dose of study drug; 
Day 91 = 91 days after the first dose of study drug ; Day  120 = 120 days after the first dose of study drug.  
In brief, it is the intent of this study to administer up to 3 doses of study drug (HB -101 or placebo) 
prior to transplantation and within proximity to the time of transp lantation. However, 2 doses of 
study drug  before transplant  will be sufficient for the  patients to be included in the ef ficacy 
analyses if a third dose  of study drug is not feasible due to transplantation timelines. Patients will 
not receive study drug after transplantation.  
After Day 0 dose administration,  the subsequent study drug adminis tration(s) should be given 
28 days (±7 days) apart . 
Patients whose planned transplantation is less than 35 days from the planned first study drug 
(HB-101 or placebo) injection should not be enrolled.  
A minimum of 7 days ( ±2 days) must be planned between the last dose of study drug and 
transplantation , unless agreed otherwise between the sponsor and investigator on a case -by-case 
basis.   
Patients whose planned transplantation is no longer than 4 months from the time of the first study 
drug (HB -101 or placebo) injection should be enrolled. Changes in transplantation timelines will 
not result in patient withdrawal from the study. In case of delayed transplantation, a dditional study 
drug injections prior to transplantation can be discussed with the spo nsor or sponsor  designee (who 
should be blinded).  The maximum allowed number of patients receiving additional study drug 
injections prior to transplantation will be capped at 10 patients (less than 10% of planned sample 
size).

Version 6.0, 09  December 2020  39 For Groups 1 and 2, i n the ev ent that the  living donor is not available and a kidney from a CMV 
seropositive (+) deceased donor becomes available, the patient can continue i n the study after 
transplantation. For Group 3, in the event that the  living donor is not available and a kidney  from 
a deceased donor becomes available, the patient can continue in the study after transplantation.  
The additional study drug booster will be administered at least 7 days ( ±2 days) prior to the 
scheduled transplantation. This allows maximal protection against CMV prior to the transplant. 
Blood collection for immunogenicity will be performed prior to each study drug booster 
administered. Immunogenicity will not be used to determine the administration of a booster as 
these results would be unblinding; instead, reactogenicity will be reviewed and the investigator  
and sponsor may decide not to administer the booster if there is evidence of increasing reactions with increasing number of vaccinations. The number and timing of vaccinations  versus 
transplantation will be described in the descriptive analyses.  
3.2 Study Indication  
Prevention of clinically significant CMV infection , defined as t he occurrence of either CMV 
end-organ disease , or initiation of anti- CMV  preemptive therapy based on documented CMV 
viremia and the cl inical condition of the patient.  
3.3 Definition of the End of the Study  
End of the study will be upon completion of the post -transplant Follow -up Period for the last 
patient a s described in Section 6.3  and the study completion of the electronic case report form 
(eCRF) for the last patient.  
3.4 Early Study Termination  
The study can be terminated at any time for any reason by the sponsor . Should this be necessary, 
the patient should be seen as soon as possible and the same assessments should be performed as 
described in Section 6.4 for a prematurely withdrawn patient. The investigator may be informed 
of additional procedures to be followed in order to ensure that adequate consideration is given to the protection of the patient’s interests. The investigator will be responsible for informing the Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) and/or Ethics Committees (ECs) of the early termination of 
the trial. The s ponsor or designee will inform competent authorities according to local regulations, 
including the reason for early termination of the  study.

Version 6.0, 09  December 2020  43 study drug post -transplantation. If a patient needs to discontinue study drug during the 
pre-transplant Treatment Period (Section 6.2 ), the patient should remain on the study and be 
followed for safety.  
For Groups 1 and 2, i f a patient is paired to a CMV seronegative ( -) kidney donor after study drug 
administration, the patient will discontinue study drug and will be evaluated for 30 days after last 
study drug administration.  
Administration of study drug during the pre -transp lant Treatment Period (Section 6.2) will be 
stopped and no further administration will be made to any of the patients following the Withdrawal 
Criteria (Section 4.4 ).  
4.4 Withdrawal Criteria  
Participation of a  patient  in this clinical study can  be discontinued for any of the following reasons:  
• The patient  withdraws consent or request s discontinuation from the study for any reason and 
without prejudice . 
• Occurrence of any medical condition or circumstance that exposes the patient  to substantial 
risk and/or does not allow the patient  to adhere to t he requirements of the protocol.  
• Any SAE , clinically significant adverse event, severe laboratory abnormality, intercurrent 
illness, or other medical condition which indicates to the investigator  that continued 
participation is not in t he best interest of the patient . 
• Pregnancy.  
• Requirement of p rohibited concomitant medication.  
• Patient  failure to comply with protocol requirements  or study- related procedures.   
• Termination of the study by the sponsor  or the regulatory authority.  
If a patient withdraws prematurely from the study due to criteria  listed above  or any other reason, 
study staff should make every effort to complete the full panel of assessments scheduled for  the 
End of Study Visit during pre-transplant  (if patient withdraws from the study before transplant)  or 
the End of Study  Visit during post-transplant  (if patient withdraws from the study after transplant) . 
If a patient withdraws consent, no additional study- related activities are required. The reason for 
patient  withdrawal must be documented in the eCRF.   
A premature withdr awal visit is not considered as the end of the study participation. At a minimum, 
all patients who discontinue study drug during the Treatment Period will be contacted to return 
30 days after the last administration of the study drug for safety follow -up evaluations according 
to Table 5.  
In the case of patients  lost to follow -up, attempts to contact the patient  must be made and 
documented in the patient ’s medical recor ds. 
Withdrawn patients  will not be replaced.

5.1 Treatment  Arms  
5.1.1 Groups 1 and 2  
Groups 1 and 2 will be  stratified  by treatment intent  (as per investigator and institutional standards)  
regarding the use of anti -CMV anti -virals post -transplantation. Each group will be randomized 
into 2 arms  to receive either HB -101 or placebo (Figure 1):  
• Group 1: P atients to be followed preemptively post -transplant:  
o Arm 1a: CMV seronegative ( -) patients awaiting  kidney transplant from a  CMV 
seropositive (+) living donor randomized to receive HB -101 before transplant, and 
monitoring after transplant.  
o Arm 1b: CMV sero negative (-) patients awaiting  kidney transplant from a CMV 
seropositive (+) living donor randomized to receive placebo before transplant, and 
monitoring after transplant.  
• Group 2: Patients to be treated prophylactically with anti -virals post-transplant:  
o Arm 2a: CMV seronegative ( -) patients awaiting  kidney transplant from a  CMV  
seropositive (+) living donor to receive HB -101 before transplant,  and anti -viral 
prophylaxis and monitoring after transplant.  
o Arm 2b: CMV seronegative ( -) patients awaiting  kidney transplant from a CMV 
seropositive (+) living donor to receive placebo before transplant, and anti -viral 
prophylaxis and monitoring after transplant.  
5.1.2 Group 3  
Group 3 will enroll CMV seropositive (+) patients awaiting kidney transplant from a CMV 
seroposit ive (+) or CMV seronegative ( -) living donor. Patient s will receive HB -101 vaccination (s) 
prior to their transplant surgery. Post -transplant CMV management will follow either preemptive 
or prophylactic care as defined at study enrollment by the investigator and institutional standards.  
5.2 Rationale for Dosing 
An effective CMV vaccine administered  prior to transplantation would overcome the limitations  
of both the prophylactic and preemptive approaches. Hookipa Biotech completed a Phase 1 healthy 
volunteer study (Study H -100-001) of t he predecessor HB -101 (encoding pp65 and a truncated gB 
of HCMV).   
In brief, Hookipa Biotech observed:  
• Neutralizing antibodies  formed against the antigen  after 2 or 3 vaccinations.   
• A favorable safety profile.  
• CMV -neutralizing antibodies  after 3 vaccinations  on par with previous ly studied vaccines . 
• gB- and pp65- specific  T-cell immunogenicity previously shown to correlate  with protection 
(in adoptive  T-cell transfer  studies).   
Hookipa Biotech GmbH  
Clinical Study Protocol H -100-002 
Confidential & Proprietary   
Version 6.0, 09  December 2020  45 Based  on this, Hookipa Biotech anticipates that the vaccine should be more  effective t han previous 
vaccines tested in the SOT  setting . 
5.3 Justification of Selected Dose 
In the Phase 1 healthy volunteer study (Study H -100-001), the HB -101 dose of 2.6 ×  107 FFU was 
found to be as immunogenic as a dose of 2.6 ×  108 FFU, with the maximum immunogenicity 
attained more quickly with 2 dose s of 2.6 ×  108 FFU. The final concentration of HB -101 to be used 
in this study (H -100-002) is 1.2 ×  108 FFU/mL. Each vial of HB -101 contains 0.7 mL of vaccine. 
Therefore , to achieve a dose that is closer to the highest dose used in the Phase 1 study, patie nts 
will be administered 2 vials (1.0 mL total injection volume) for a total dose of 1.2 ×  108 FFU/mL 
per administration. Based on the Phase 1 study, this dose should attain maximum immunogenicity 
with minimal number of administrations.  
The intent of this  study is to attain maximum immunogenicity as quickly as possible prior to 
transplantation by administering 3 doses of HB -101. The dosing schedule for the 3 doses is planned 
for 0, 1, and 3 months (see Section 3.1 ). Patients enrolled should have a kidney transplantation 
ideally planned between 2 and 4 months after the first injection of study drug. This should ensure 
that patients receive at least 2 doses of HB -101; however, unanticipated changes in transplantation 
timelines may not allow for 2 doses of HB -101 to be administered. As vaccination 
post-transplantation is not allowed as part of this protocol, these patients will receive 1 dose of 
HB-101. This is not the intent of this study, but is a potential consequence of unanticipated changes 
in transplantation timelines.  
5.4 Randomization and Blinding  
5.4.1 Groups 1 and 2  
Adult CMV  seronegative  (-) patients awaiting  kidney transplant from  a CMV  seropositive  (+) 
living donor  will be enrolled into Groups 1 or 2  according to treatment intent with reg ard to the 
method of CMV prevention after transplant (either preemptive or prophylactic) as defined at study 
enrollment by the investigator and institutional standards.  
• Group 1 -  The preemptive group will be randomized in a 2:1 ra tio (HB-101:placebo)  to receive 
either HB -101 or placebo  before transplant . Post -transplant patients will be monitored per 
preemptive institutional standards.  
• Group 2 -  The prophylactic group will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio  (HB-101:placebo)  to 
receive either HB -101 or placebo  before transplant . Post -transplant pa tients will receive 3  to 
6 months of anti -viral prophylaxis following institutional standards.  
Patients will be randomized via a centralized Interactive Response Technology  (IRT) system. 
Enrollment of Group 2 will be limited to no more than 54% of total p atients.   
The study is double  blind for Groups 1 and 2; patients and investigators will be blinded to treatment 
assignment.  
At each site, the pharmacy staff will include unblinded personnel. Based on the treatment 
assignment from the automated randomization system  (i.e., IRT), an unblinded pharmacist or 
designee at each  site will prepare the study drug injection syringe.  Syringes containing study drug 
Hookipa Biotech GmbH  
Clinical Study Protocol H -100-002 
Confidential & Proprietary   
Version 6.0, 09  December 2020  46 will be prepared  per instructions in the Investigational Medicinal Product M anual, independent of 
clinical staff, and delivered to the clinical team for blinded administration.  
Syringes, syringe labels, and translucent colored tape are supplied with the study drug. The syringe 
labels are not translucent  and therefore, the syringe  label masks the color of the solution  (as the 
placebo and active vaccine differ slightly in color) in the syringe to avoid potential unblinding. Furthermore, the syringe with placebo is also stored at 2º C to 8 ºC (35.6 ºF to 46.4 ºF) to mimic 
HB-101 in syringes to avoid potential unblinding to the dose administrator (who is blinded).  
The syringe will be distributed to the blinded investigator  or their designee  with the syringe  label 
in place covering the entire volume of the drug to be administered. The labe l will not allow the 
blinded investigator  or their designee  to differentiate between the placebo or study drug liquid but 
still be able to see that the amount of liquid is 1 mL and safely administer it to the patient. The clinical monitoring team will also  be blinded to treatment assignment. An independent unblinded 
team will monitor drug accountability and protocol compliance at the pharmacy.  
5.4.2 Group 3  
Group 3 will be open  label . In Group 3, CMV seropositive (+) patients awaiting kidney transplant 
from a CM V seropositive (+) or CMV seronegative ( -) donor  will be enrolled to receive HB -101 
vaccin ation (s) prior to their transplant surgery.  
There will be no randomization or blinding for patients in Group 3. Enrollment of Group 3 will be 
a minimum of  15% of tota l patients.  
5.5 Breaking the Blind  (Groups 1 and 2 O nly) 
Unblinding by request of an investigator  should only occur in the e vent of an emergency or adverse  
event for which it is necessary to know the treatment assignment of an individual patient. If the 
investigator  must identify the treatment assignment of an individual patient,  the investigator  or 
qualified designee should request the medication information from the I RT system and promptly 
contact the s ponsor or s ponsor designee.  The documentation from the IRT  system  indicating the 
code break must be ret ained with the patient ’s source  docume nts in a secure manner so as not  to 
unblind the treatment assignment  to other site or sponsor  personnel.  
Hookipa Biotech study team members will be unblinded after each patient receives their last dose 
of study drug and undergoes his/her kidney transplantation. Medpace , the investigator, and study 
site personnel will remain blinded for the entire study with the exception of the study site 
pharmacist or research nurse who prepares the study drug for administration.

Version 6.0, 09  December 2020  49 5.7.2 Allowed  Prior  Medications  and Vaccinations  
Inhaled and topical steroids and low -dose oral corticosteroids  (≤10 m g/day of  prednisone or 
equivalent)  are allowed.   
5.7.3 Documentation of Prior and Concomitant Medication and Vaccination  Use 
At every study visit and contact, the investigator  should question the patient  regarding any 
medication taken and treatment received by the patie nt. 
The investigator  will review the following criteria at each study visit subsequent to the first study 
drug administration. If any criterion becomes pertinent during the study, it may not require 
withdrawal of the patient from the study but could impact  whether a patient could be assessed in 
sensitivity analyses:  
• Use of any investigational or non- registered product (drug/vaccine) other than the study drug 
during the study period.  
• Receipt of routine commercial vaccinations (with the exception of seasonal influenza vaccination) within 5 months after study entry.  
• Administration of more than 7 days of immunosuppressants or other immune -modifying drugs  
prior to transplantation. For corticosteroids, this would mean prednisone ≥ 0.125 mg/kg/day 
(maximum 10 mg/da y), or equivalent. Inhaled and topical steroids and low -dose oral  
corticosteroids  (≤10 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent) are allowed. Immunosuppressive 
medication necessary to prevent acute rejection of a previous kidney transplant is allowed.  
During the study, all concomitant medications,  including changes in chronic medication (with the 
exception of vitamins and/or dietary supplements) , should be recorded in t he eCRF  from Day 0 up  
through 30  days after the last dose of study drug , or on the Day of Tr ansplant , whichever occur s 
first. The process additionally applies  to any medication the patient  received to treat an adverse 
event. Chronic medication is defined as medication taken regularly by the patient  for a minimum 
of 6 months  before the study start ( e.g., contraceptive pill).  
If the patient withdraws from the study before transplant, concomi tant medications considered by 
the investigator  to be  related to SAEs and taken by patients befor e transplant should be recorded 
in the eCRF.   
Similarly, concomitant medications considered by the investigator  to be  related to SAEs and taken 
by patients after transplant should be recorded  in the eCRF  after transp lant up to the En d of Study 
Visit.  Standard immunosuppression post -transplantation is  allowed, including induction regimen 
for immunosuppression ( e.g., antithymocyte globulin).  
5.7.4 Documentation of Concomitant Medications of Special Int erest  
Concomitant medic ations of special interest should  be docu mented at time points per Table  6. 
Concomitant medications of special interest within 7 days prior to and after transplant are 
anti-virals and immunosuppressants (including induction regimen, e.g., antithymocyte globulin), 
non-study vaccines, granulocyte colony- stimulating factor, erythropoietin, and transfusions of  
blood product. Concomitant medications  of special interest, taken by patient s within 7 days prior 
to transplant and throughout the study after transplant, s hould be recorded in the eCRF .

6.1 Clinical Screening  
The Screening P eriod starts after a patient has signed and dated the written  informed consent 
form  (ICF) to participate in the study  and concludes on the day of randomizati on (for Groups 1 
and 2) or dosing (for Group 3) . The Screening Period should be within 56  days of Day 0 . After 
56 days, if the patient has not withdrawn from the study, he/she  will be rescreened with s ponsor 
approval.  
The patient must sign and date the wr itten ICF prior to study  procedures.  
The following Screening assessments  can be conducted for up to 14 days pri or to Day 0 : 
• Inclusion/exclusion criteria reviewed.  
• Patient’s  relevant  medical history recorded.  
• Patient’s medication/vaccination history recorde d. 
• Safety blood collection ( complete blood count  with differential, liver function tests and 
enzymes, and renal function tests)  at the local or central laboratory . 
• Pregnancy test (serum or urine hCG test , urine testing limited to patients producing urine daily) 
(for females of childbearing potential).  
• Serum follicle -stimulating hormone  (for all females aged ≤ 50 years with 6 months of 
spontaneous amenorrhea ).  
• Physical examination.  
The following Screening assessment  can be conducted for up t o 56 days  prior to Day 0:  
• Patient signs and dates written ICF.  
• Patient demographics recorded.  
• CMV serology sample.  
During Screening, in formation collected on screen  failures should be recorded on the eCRF.  
Clinical Screening study assessm ents are listed in  Table 5. 
If the kidney transplant recipient is identified to be CMV seronegative  (-) and an HLA -matched 
CMV seropositive (+) donor is identified (listed) and has passed the first visit of eligibility, then 
there is a reasonable likelihood that the recipient will be paired with a living kidney donor, and the 
transplant recipient can be screened for enrollment into Group 1 or 2 and dosed in the study.  
If after study drug administration,  the CMV seronegative  (-) transplant recipient is paired with a 
kidney donor who is CMV seronegative  (-):  
• The patient  will discontinue from further study drug administration and will be evaluated for 
30 days post -dose from last s tudy drug safety monitoring per protocol.  
• If the patient  has an ongoing adverse event suspected to be related to study drug, the patien t 
will continue to be monitored until the adverse event resolves completely or to baseline, whichever occurs first.

CMV seropositive ( +) or CMV seronegative  (-) donor is identified  (listed) and  has passed the first 
visit of eligibility,  and has a transplantation planned between 2 and 4 months after  the first study 
drug injection , then the transplant recipient can be screened for enrollment into Group 3 and dosed 
in the study.  
6.1.1 Information to be Collected on Screen F ailures  
Patients who sign the study ICF but who fail to be started on study drug prior to transplant  for any 
reason will be considered screen failures. The reason for a patient no t being started on study drug 
will be entered on the Screen Fail  eCRF and every patient’s demographic information will be 
recorded on the Demogr aphy eCRF. No other data will be entered into the clinical database for 
patients who are screen failures.  
6.2 Pre-Transplant : Treatment Period  
During the study, t he pre-transplant Treatment Period starts on Day 0 on the first day of dosing and 
lasts up to the time of kidney transplant  or End of Study Visit.  
First dose of study drug ( Day 0 ) is scheduled when the patient in Groups 1 or  2 has a confirmed  
CMV seropositive  (+) kidney donor identified or when the patient in Group 3 has a confirmed 
CMV seropositiv e (+) or CMV seronegative ( -) kidney donor identified , and there is a plan and/or 
date to transplant.  
Prior to patients receiving first dose of study drug on Day 0, the patient’s inclusion/exclusion 
criteria should be reviewed  again . Patients in Groups 1 a nd 2 will be randomized  prior to or  on 
Day 0  pre-dose. 
Each study drug administration should be given 28 days ( ±7 days) apart. Dosing of study drug will 
occur according to the a dministration schedule as per  Table 2. 
A minimum of 7 days  (±2 days) must be planned between the last  dose of study drug and 
transplantation , unless agreed otherwise between the sponsor and investigator on a case -by-case 
basis.  
Study a ssessments during the pre -transplant Treatment P eriod are listed in Table  5.  
In some cases, patients could receive the last dose of study drug before their kidne y transplant, but 
their post -injection follow -up visit s (7 and 30 days after the last dose of study drug) will occur 
after their transplant. Th ese post-injection follow -up visit s should be scheduled based on the date 
of the last (final) study drug administratio n, NOT by transplantation date. It is possible that the 
time window of post -injection follow -up visit assessments will b e redundant to a visit in the 
post-transplant  period. If the time window is ± 2 weeks, assessments should NOT be duplicated. 
Study assessments are listed in  Table  5 and Table 6. 
6.3 Post-Transplant: Follow -Up Period for Efficac y 
During the st udy, the post -transplant Fol low-up Period for Efficacy of the study is the follow -up 
period that  starts after a patient receives a kidney transplant  and concludes when the patient  either  
completes the study or is withdrawn or withdraws  from the study.  
Patients will not  receive study drug during the post-transplant Follow -up Period for Efficacy.

Study assessments during the  post-transplant Follow -up Period for Efficacy are listed in Table 6. 
6.4 End of Study Visit (Including Study Completion and Study Withdrawal)  
The patient will complete and conclude the study on whichever day of the study one of the 
following events first occur s:  
• When the patient completes the study follow -up (12 months post-transplant).  
• If for some reason kidney transplant has not occurred by 12 months after the first dose of study 
drug.  
• If the p atient experiences graft failure requiring removal of the transplanted organ or return s to 
dialysis . 
• If the patient is withdraw n or withdraws  from the study.  
• If the patient is lost to follow -up.  
• If the patient dies.  
If a patient  completes the study or  is withdrawn  or withdraws  from the study,  a study visit should 
be scheduled within 14 days, at which time all study assessments l isted for the End of Study Visit 
should be conducted.  
During post -transplant, study assessments for  the End of Study Visit are listed  in Table 6.  
Dosing during the s tudy will end when all enrolled patients have completed their planned doses of 
study drug.  The study will end when the last patient last visit post- transplantation is completed.  
If a patient does not receive study drug prior to transplant, the End of Study  Visit is not necessa ry 
(screen failure). The patient  would be withdrawn from the study.

Version 6.0, 09  December 2020  58 10 SAFETY  ASSESSMENTS 
10.1 Adverse Events  
An adverse event is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation subject 
administered a pharmaceutical product, which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with 
this treatment. An adverse event can therefore be any unfav orable and/or unintended sign 
(including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the 
use of an investigational medicinal product, whether or not related to the investigational medicinal 
product. All adverse events, i ncluding observed or volunteered problems, complaints, or 
symptoms, are to be recorded on the appropriate eCRF . 
Adverse events, which include clinical laboratory test variables,  will be monitored and recorded 
from the time of th e first injection  of study drug up through 30 days after the last  injection  of study 
drug. Only adverse events considered  by the investigator to be  related to study drug  should be 
recorded  from 31 days after  the last injection  of study drug up through the  End of Study Visit.  
During the study, a dverse events of special interest post -transplant should be recorded after 
transplant  up to the  End of Study Visit . Adverse  events of special interest after kidney transplant 
are gr aft rejection, CMV syndrome, and CMV  disease . Physical examination (general assessment 
based on the complaints of the patient and on the investigator’s judgment) and local assessment of 
the study drug injection site will be conducted during the  study. Results of the physical 
examination will be captured in study sources, clinically significant abnormalities will be reported as patient medical history prior to randomization  (for Groups 1 and 2)  or dosing (for Group 3) , and  
adverse events for worsening or emerging findings after randomization (for Groups  1 and  2) or 
dosing (for Group 3) . Patient s should be instructed to report any adverse event that they experience 
to the investigator . From the time of first dose of study drug , investigator s should make an 
assessment for adverse events at each visit and record the event on the appropriate adverse event 
eCRF . 
Wherever possible, a specific disease or syndrome rather than individual associated signs and 
symptoms should be identified by the investigator  and recorded on the eCRF . However, if an 
observed or reported s ign or symptom is not considered a component of a specific disease or 
syndrome by the investigator , it should be recorded as a separate adverse event on the eCRF . 
Additionally, the condition that led to a medical or surgical procedure ( e.g., surgery, endos copy, 
tooth extraction, or transfusion) should be recorded as an adverse event, not the procedure.  
Any medical  condition alr eady present at Screening  should not be reported as an adver se event 
unless the medical condition or signs  or symptoms present at Day 0  changes in severity or 
seriousness at any time during the study. In this case, it s hould be reported as an adverse event.  
Clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings that are detected during the study or are present 
at Screening  and significantly worsen during the study should be reported as adverse event s. The 
investigator  will exercise his /her medical and scientific judgment in deciding whether an abnormal 
laboratory finding or other abnormal assessment is clinically significant. Clinically significant 
abnormal laboratory values occurring during the clinical study will be followed until repeat tests 
return to normal, stabilize, or are no longer clinically significant. Any abnormal test that is 
determined to be an error  does not require reporting as an adverse event .

Version 6.0, 09  December 2020  59 10.1.1  Adverse (Drug) Reaction  
All noxious and unintended responses to a medicinal product related to any dose should be 
considere d an adverse drug reaction. “Responses” to a medicinal product means that a causal 
relationship between a medicinal product and an adverse event is at least a reasonable possibility,  
i.e., the relationship cannot be ruled out.  
10.1.2  Unexpected Adverse Drug Reaction  
An unexpected adverse drug reaction is defined as an adverse reaction, the natur e or severity of 
which is not consistent with the applicable product information. For predecessor HB -101, the 
reference safety  information is included in the  Investigator ’s Brochure currently in force. T he 
reference safety inf ormation will be reviewed annu ally and the periodicity of the review will be 
harmonized with the reporting period of the De velopment Safety Update Report.  
10.1.3  Assessment of Adverse Events by the Investigator  
The investigator  will assess the severity (intensity) of each adverse event , and will  categorize each 
adverse event as to its potential relationship to study drug using  the categories of yes or no . 
Assessment of Severity:  
The severity of all adverse events  except  reactogenicity  (see Section  10.6)  should be graded 
according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.03 .  
For those adverse events not listed in the CTCAE, the following grading system should be used:  
• Mild (CTCAE Grade 1): Transient symptoms, awareness of sign/symptom, but easily tolerated and no interference with patient’s daily activities.  
• Moderate (CTCAE Grade 2): Marked signs/symptoms that interfere with patient’s usual 
activities, but still acceptable.  
• Severe (CTCAE Grade 3): Incapacitating signs/symptoms which cause considerable 
interference with the patient’s daily activities, unacceptable.  
• Life-threatening (CTCAE Grade 4): Life -threatening or disabling adverse event.  
• Death (CTCAE Grade 5): Death -related adverse event.  
• For the assessment of local and systemic injection site reactions (reactogenicity), the  Food and 
Drug Administration  (FDA)  “Guidance for Industry: Toxicity Grading Scale for Healthy Adult 
and Adolescent Volunteers Enrolled in Preventive Vaccine Clinical Trials” should be used. 
See Section  10.6. 
Causality Assessment : 
The relationship of an adverse event to the administration of the study drug  is to be assessed 
according to the following definitions:  
No (unrelated, not related, no relation) –  The time course between the administration of study drug  
and the occurrence or worsening of the adverse event rules out a causal relationship and another cause (concomitant drugs, therapies, complications, etc.) is suspected.  
Hookipa Biotech GmbH  
Clinical Study Protocol H -100-002 
Confidential & Proprietary   
Version 6.0, 09  December 2020  60 Yes (related) – The time course between the administration of study drug and the occur rence or 
worsening of the adverse event is consistent with a causal relationship and no other cause 
(concomitant drugs, therapies, complications, etc.) can be identified.  
The definition implies a reasonable possibility of a causal relationship between the event and the study drug. This means that there are facts (evidence) or arguments  to suggest a causal relationship.  
The following factors should also be considered:  
• The temporal sequence from study drug administration - 
o The event should occur after the stud y drug is given. The length of time from study drug 
exposure to event should be evaluated in the clinical context of the event.  
• Underlying, concomitant, intercurrent diseases - 
o Each report should be evaluated in the context of the natural history and course of the disease being treated and any other disease the patient  may have.  
• Concomitant drug-  
o The other drugs the patient  is taking or the treatment the patient  receives should be 
examined to determine whether any of them might be recognized to cause the event in 
question.  
• Known response pattern for this class of study drug-  
o Clinical and/or preclinical data may indicate whether a particular response is likely to be a class effect.  
• Exposure to physical and/or mental stresses - 
o The exposure to stress might induce adverse changes in the recipient and provide a logical and better explanation for the event.  
• The pharmacology and pharmacokinetics of the study drug-  
o The known pharmacologic properties (absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion) of the study drug should be considered.  
Assessment of Outcomes:  
The outcome of any non- serious adverse event or any SAE is to be assessed as:  
• Recovered/resolved.  
• Not recovered/not resolved.  
• Recovering/resolving.  
• Recovered with s equelae/resolved with sequelae.  
• Fatal (SAEs only).

Version 6.0, 09  December 2020  61 10.2 Serious Adverse Event s 
An adverse event or adverse reaction is considered serious if,  in the view of either the investigator  
or sponsor , it results in any of the following outcomes:  
• Death . 
• A life -threatening adverse event . 
o NOTE: An adverse event or adverse reaction is considered “life- threatening” if, in view of 
either the investigator  or sponsor , its occurrence places the patient  at immediate risk of 
death. It does not include an event that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have 
caused death.  
• Requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalizations . 
o NOTE: Pre -planned, elective procedures for pre- existing condition(s) (such as biopsies or 
dialysis) leading to hospitalization or prolonging hospitalization are NOT considered SAEs.  However, hospitalizations for procedures conducted for the diagnosis of CMV 
disease (i .e., biopsy, endoscopy), are considered events of special interest and will be 
collected as SAEs.  
o NOTE : Any hospital admission with at least 1  overnight stay will be considered an 
inpatient hospitalization. An emergency room visit without hospital admission will not be 
recorded as a SAE  under this criterion, nor will hospitalization for a procedure scheduled 
or planned before signing of informed consent. However, unexpected complications and/or prolongation of hospitalization that occur during elective surger y should be recorded as 
adverse event s and assessed for seriousness.  Admission to the hospital for social or 
situational reasons ( i.e., no place to stay, live too far away to come for hospital visits) will 
not be considered inpatient hospitalizations.  
• A persistent or significant disability/incapacity or substantial disruption of ability to conduct 
normal life functions . 
• A congenital anomaly/birth defect . 
• An important medical event.  
o NOTE: Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospitalization may be considered an SAE when, based upon appropriate medical 
judgment, they may jeopardize the  patient  and may require medical or surgical intervention 
to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. Examples of such m edical events include 
allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, 
blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalizations, or the 
development of drug dependency.  
• Is a Grade 4 adver se event considered related to the study drug.

Version 6.0, 09  December 2020  62 10.3 Serious Adverse Event Reporting –  Procedures for Investigators  
Initial Reports  
Serious adverse events should be recorded during the entire study.  
All SAEs that occur  from the time of the first injection  of study drug up through the End of Study 
Visit must  be reported to  Medpace Clinical Safety within 24  hours of the knowledge of the 
occurrence (this refers to any adverse event that meets any of the aforementioned seri ous criteria) .  
To report the SAE, complete the SAE form electronically in the electronic data capture (EDC) 
system for the study. When the form is completed, Medpace Safety personnel will be notified 
electronically and will retrieve the form. If the event meets serious cri teria and it is not possible to  
access the EDC system , send an email to Medpace Safety  and fax  or email the completed p aper 
SAE form to  Medpace within 24 hours of awareness. When the EDC system becomes available, 
the SAE information must be entered within 24 hours of the system becoming available.  
The back -up SAE form and SAE instructions form list Safety Contact Information for SAE 
reporting.  
Follow-Up Reports  
The investigator  must continue to follow the patien t until the SAE has subsided or until the 
condition becomes chronic in nature, stabilizes (in the case of persistent impairment) , or the patient  
dies. 
Within 24 hours of receipt of follow -up information, the investigator  must update  the SAE  form  
electronically in the EDC system for the study and subm it any supporting documentation  
(e.g., patient  discharge summary or autopsy reports)  to Medpace Clinical Safety via  fax or email. 
If it is not p ossible to access the EDC system, r efer to the steps outlined above for initial reporting 
of SAEs.  
10.4 Pregnancy Reporting  
If the patient  or partner of a patient  participating in the study becomes pregnant  following dosing 
of study drug during the study or wi thin 30 days of discontinuing study drug, the investigator  
should report the pregnancy to Medpace Clinical Safety within 24 hours of being notified. 
Medpace Clinical Safety will then forward the Exposure In Utero form to the investigator  for 
completion.  
A patient  becoming pregnant while on study drug will immediately be withdrawn from  the study 
and early withdrawal  study procedures will be performed.  
The patient  or partner  should be followed by the investigator  until completion of the pregnancy. 
Patients who become pregnant during the study will be consented to collect information on the outcome of the pregnancy. If the pregnancy ends for any reason before the anticipated date, the 
investigator  should notify Med pace Clinical Safety. At the completion of the pregnancy, the 
investigator  will document the outcome of the pregnancy. If the outcome of the pregnancy meets 
the criteria for immediate classification as an SAE ( i.e., postpartum complication, stillbirth, 
neonatal  death , spontaneous  abortion, or congenital anomaly), the investigator  should follow the 
steps for reporting an SAE.

reactions that are fat al or life -threateni ng as soon as possible to the FDA, applicable competent 
authorities in all the Member States concerned, and t o the Central E C, and in any case no later than 
7 days after knowledge by the sponsor  of such a  case, and that relevant follow -up information will 
subsequently be communicated within an additional 8 days.  
All other suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions will be reported to the FDA, applicable 
competent authorities concerned , and to the Centr al EC concerned  as soon as poss ible but within 
a maximum of 15 days of first knowledge by the sponsor .  
The sponsor  will also inform all investigator s as required. The investigators will report suspected 
unexpected serious adverse reactions to the  IRB/Local  EC as appropriate.  
Expedited reporting of suspected unexpected serious  adverse reactions related to 
non-investigational medical product s (NIMP s) will not be necessary.  Listings of cases related to 
NIMPs will be included in the Development Safety Update Report.  
10.6 Reactogenicity  
10.6.1  60-Minute On- Site Post- Injection  Observation  
On days patients receive study drug, the patients will be observed on site for at least 60 minutes 
after study drug administration, and potential signs/symptoms of reactogenicity will be noted by 
the investigator  or designee, as listed in Table 5. Potential signs/symptoms of reactogenicity will 
be recor ded in the adverse event section of the eCRF.  If 2 injections were used to administer a 
dose, both injection sites should be monitored and findings should identify local reactions by site.  
Local and general symptoms  of reactogenicity  will be assessed  accor ding to the FDA “Guidance 
for Industry: Toxicity Grading Scale for Healthy Adult and Adolescent Volunteers Enrolled in 
Preventive Vaccine Clinical Trials” (see Appendix C) , after each study drug administration , as 
listed in Table  5.  
10.6.2  Study D rug Injection  Site Examination  
Local and general symptoms  of reactogenicity will be assessed  according to the FDA “Guidance 
for Industry: Toxicity Grading Scale for Healthy Adult and Adolescent Volunteers Enrolled in 
Preventive Vaccine Clinical Trials” (see Appendix C) , after each study drug administration, as 
listed in Table  5.  
If a patient is not able to come to the clinic 7 days after each study drug administration (Visits 3, 5, and 7 in Table  5) for the reactogenicity and vital sign assess ments, the s ponsor or their designe e 
needs to be contacted as soon as possible to discuss.  
The sponsor or their designee can allow patients with Day 0 reactogenicity symptom grading of 
mild to moderate (Grade 1 to 2) to have the 7 days after study drug administration assessments 
performed by the site remotely, via a phone call with the patient.  
Source documents generated from the phone call will need to include all data required per the protocol to enable assessments per FDA guidelines (Appendix C). Signs  or symptoms that cannot 
be collected remotely will need to be specified in the source documents as missing and entered in 
the eCRF as missing data.

11.1 Exploratory Biomarker Assessments  
If the patient consents, e xploratory biomarker research may be conducted on any blood samples 
collected during the study. These additional investigations could extend the search for other 
potentially relevant biomarkers for the HB -101 effect and/or safety. This may also include research 
to help develop ways to detect, monitor , or treat CMV infection. These additional investigations 
would be dependent upon clinical outcome, reagent, and sample availability. Additional consent 
will be obtained in the case of genetic testing being performed as part of the exploratory biomarker 
assessments. If the patient does not consent to the exploratory biomarker assessments, the pa tient 
will still be allowed to participate in the study.  
11.2 Additional Exploratory Biomarker Assessment Using Remaining Biomarker 
Samples  
If the patient consents, their  remaining blood samples may be stored for up to 15 years for 
additional research related to HB -101 and CMV disease or other study treatments. This may also 
include research to help develop ways to detect, monitor, or treat CMV infection. A decision to 
perform such exploratory biomarker research studies would be based on outcome data or from new 
scientific findings related to the drug class or disease, as well as reagent and assay availability.

A primary obj ective  is to assess the safe ty and reactogenicity of HB -101 in CMV seronegative (-) 
patients  who are awaiting a kidney transplant from a CMV  seropositive  (+) living donor  (Groups  1 
and 2) and to assess the safety and reactogenicity of HB -101 in CMV seropositive (+) patients who 
are awaiting a kidney transplant from a CMV seropositive (+) or CMV seronegative ( -) living 
donor  (Group 3) . This objective will be assessed by treatment group for Groups  1 and 2 and 
open- label HB-101 for Group 3 and by number of vaccinations for the following endpoints:  
• Incidence and severity of adverse event s, SAEs, and changes in laboratory values  
• Incidence and severity of localized or generalized injection site reactions  
All safety analyses will be performed on the Safety Population. Analyses will be based on adverse 
events, vital signs, and clinical labo ratory assessments. Safety analyses will be descriptive and will 
be presented in tabular format with the appropriate summary statistics . 
A treatment -emergent adverse event (TEAE) is defined as an adverse event with a start date and 
time on or after the adm inistration of study drug . The number and percentage of patients with 
TEAEs will be tabulated by System Organ Class and Preferred Term for each treatment group and 
by severity and relationship to treatment. Serious adverse events and adverse events leading to 
discontinuation from study drug  will be summarized by treatment group . Listings will also be 
generated  for SAEs and adverse events leading to discontinuation of study drug. The percentage 
of patients reporting any adverse events of special interest wil l also be summarized.  
Descriptive statistics will be provided for clinical laboratory data and  vital signs data, presented as 
both actual values and changes from Day 0 over time.   
12.2.5  Sample Size Determination  
A total sample size of approximately 150 patients is planned for the study. Patients in Groups 1 and 2 will be randomized with a 2:1 ratio for active versus placebo. Patients in Group 3 will be 
enrolled to receive open -label HB -101. The sample size has been set for an initial assessment of 
the safety and immunogenicity of the vaccine candidate, which will provide for approximately 
100 patients  exposed to the HB -101 vaccine. No formal statistical assessment for sample size 
determination has been conducted. The sample size is considered adequate to provide t he 
necessary safety and immunogenicity data and help with the determination of point estimates of 
clinical efficacy endpoints (clinically significant CMV infection as defined by the FDA “Guidance 
for Industry: Cytomegalovirus in Transplantation: Developing Drugs to Treat or Prevent Disease”) 
to design and adequately statistically power Phase 3 trials.

• Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities  (latest)  for patient  medical history and adverse 
events . 
• World Health Organ ization Drug Dictionary for prior and concomitant medications.  
13.1.5  Data Validation  
Validation checks programmed within the EDC system, as well as supplemental validation performed via review of the downloaded data, will be applied to the data in order to ensure 
accurate, consistent, and reliable data. Data identified as erroneous,  or data that are missing, will 
be referred to the investigative site for resolution through data queries.  
The eCRFs must be reviewed and electronically signed by the investigator . 
13.2 Record Keeping  
Records of patients , source documents, monitoring visit logs, eCRFs, inventory of study product, 
regulatory documents, and other sponsor  correspondence pertaining to the study must be kept in 
the appropriate study files at the site. Source  data are defined as all information in original records 
and certified copies of original records of clinical findings, observations, or other activities in a 
clinical study necessary for the evaluation and reconstruction of the clinical study. Source data  are 
contained in source documents (original records or certified copies). These records will be retained in a secure file for the period as set forth in the Clinical Study Agreement. Prior to transfer or 
destruction of these records, the sponsor  must be n otified in writing and be given the opportunity 
to further store such records.

14.1 Ethical Conduct of the Study  
Good Clinical Practice (GCP) is an international ethical and scientific quality standard for 
designi ng, conducting, recording, and reporting studies that involve human patient s. Compliance 
with this standard provides public assurance that the rights, safety, and well -being of study patient s 
are protected, consistent with the principles that have their or igin in the Declaration of Helsinki, 
and that the clinical study data are credible.  
14.2 Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethics Committee  
For United States study sites:  
The IRB will review all appropriate study documentation in order to safeguard the ri ghts, safety, 
and well -being of patient s. The study will only be conducted at sites where IRB approval has been 
obtained. The protocol, Investigator’s Brochure, ICF , advertisements (if applicable), written 
information given to the patien ts, safety updates,  annual progress reports, and any revisions to 
these documents will be provided to the IRB by the investigator . 
Federal regulations and International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) Guidelines require that 
approval be obtained from an IRB prior to participation of patient s in research studies. Prior to 
study onset, the protocol, any protocol amendments, ICF s, advertisements to be used for patient 
recruitment, and any other written information regarding this study to be provided to a patient  or 
patient’s  legal guardi an must be approved by the IRB.  
No drug will be released to the site for dosing until written IRB authorization ha s been received 
by the sponsor . 
For European study sites:  
It is the responsibility of the sponsor  or their designee (i .e., Medpace) to obtain the approval of the 
responsible ECs according to the national regulations.  
The study will only start  at the respective sites once the respective committee’s written approval 
has been given.  
14.3 Informed Consent  
The ICF and any changes to the ICF made during the course of the study must be agreed to by the 
sponsor  or designee and the IRB /EC prior to its use and must be in compliance with all ICH GCP, 
local regulatory requirements, and legal requirements.  
The investigator  must ensure that each study patien t is fully informed about the nature and 
objectives of the study and possible risks associated with participation and must ensure that the 
patient has been informed of his/her rights to privacy. The investigator  will obtain written informed 
consent from each patient  before any study- specific activity is performed and should document in 
the source documentation that consent was obtained prior to enrollment in the study. The original 
signed copy of the ICF must be maintained by the investigator  and is subject to inspection by a 
representative of the sponsor , their representatives, auditors, the IRB /EC, and/or regulatory 
agencies. A copy of the signed ICF will be given to the patient .

the protocol, ICH GCP, Directive 2001/20/EC  (Europe an study sites) , applicable regulat ory 
requirements, and the Declaration of Helsinki , and that valid data are entered into the eCRFs.  
To achieve this objective, the  CRA’s  duties are to aid the investigator  and, at the same time, the 
sponsor , in the maintenance of complete, legible, well organized , and easily retrievable data. 
Before the enrollment of any patien t in this study, the sponsor  or their designee will review with 
the investigator  and site personnel the following documents: protocol,  Investigator ’s Brochure, 
eCRFs and procedures for their completion, informed consent process, and the procedure for 
reporting SAEs.  
The investigator  will permit the sponsor  or their designee to monitor the study as frequently as 
deemed necessary to determ ine that data recording and protocol adherence are satisfactory. During 
the monitoring visits, information recorded on the eCRFs will be verified against source 
documents and requests for clarification or correction may be made. After the eCRF data  are 
entered by the site, the CRA will review the data for safety information, completeness, accuracy, 
and logical consistency. Computer programs that identify data inconsistencies may be used to help 
monitor the clinical study. If necessary, requests for clarific ation or correction will be sent to 
investigator s. The investigator  and his/her staff will be expected to cooperate with the CRA  and 
provide any missing information, whenever possible.  
All monitoring activities will be reported and archived. In addition, monitoring visits will be 
documented at the investigational site by signature and date on the study- specific monitoring log.  
14.5 Disclosure of Data  
Data generated by this study must be available for inspection by the FDA, the sponsor  or their 
designee, applicab le foreign health authorities, and the IRB /EC as appropriate. Patients  may

Version 6.0, 09  December 2020  88 Table 9.  Updated 2015 Banff Classification Categories  
Category 1: Normal biopsy or nonspecific changes  
Category 2: Antibody -mediated changes  
Acute/active ABMR  All 3 features must be present for diagnosis. Biopsies showing histological features plus 
evidence of current/recent antibody interaction with vascular endothelium or DSA, but not 
both, may be designated as suspicious for acute/active ABMR. Lesions may be clinically 
acute or smoldering or may be subclinical; it should be noted if the lesion is C4d -positive or 
C4d-negative, based on the following criteria:  
1. Histologic evidence of acute tissue injury, including one or more of the following:  
• Microvascular inflammation (g >0 in the absence of recurrent or de novo 
glomerulonephritis, and/or ptc >0)  
• Intimal or transmural arteritis (v >0)1 
• Acute thrombotic microangiopathy in the absence of any other cause  
• Acute tubular injury in the absence of any other apparent cause  
2. Evidence of current/recent antibody interaction with vascular endothelium, including at least 
one of the following:  
• Linear C4d staining in peritubular capillaries (C4d2 or C4d3 by IF on frozen 
sections or C4d >0 by IHC on paraffin sections)  
• At least moderate microvascular inflammation ([g + ptc] ≥2), although in the 
presence of acute TCMR, borderline infiltrate, or infection; ptc ≥ 2 alone is not 
sufficient, and g must be ≥ 1  
• Increased expression of gene transcripts in the biopsy tissue i ndicative of 
endothelial injury, if thoroughly validated  
3. Serologic evidence of DSAs (HLA or other antigens) : 
• Biopsies suspicious for ABMR on the basis of meeting criteria  1 and 2 should 
prompt expedited DSA testing  
Chronic active ABMR2 All 3 features must be present for diagnosis. As with acute/active ABMR, biopsies showing 
histological features plus evidence of current/recent antibody interaction with vascular 
endothelium or DSA, but not both, may be designated as suspicious, and it sho uld be noted if 
the lesion is C4d -positive or C4d -negative, based on the criteria listed:  
1. Histologic evidence of chronic tissue injury, including one or more of the following:  
• TG (cg >0), if no evidence of chronic thrombotic microangiopathy; includes 
changes evident by EM only (cg1a; se e Table 10) 
• Severe peritubular capillary basement membrane multilayering (requires EM)3 
• Arterial intimal fibrosis of new onset, excluding other causes; leukocytes within the 
sclerotic intima favor chronic  ABMR if there is no prior history of biopsy- proven 
TCMR with arterial involvement but are not required  
2. Evidence of current/recent antibody interaction with vascular endothelium, including at least 
one of the following:  
• Linear C4d staining in peritubular capillaries (C4d2 or C4d3 by IF on frozen sections, or C4d >0 by IHC on paraffin sections)  
• At least moderate microvascular inflammation ([g + ptc] ≥2), although in the 
presence of acute TCMR, borderline infiltrate, or in fection, ptc ≥2 alone is not 
sufficient and g must be ≥1 
• Increased expression of gene transcripts in the biopsy tissue indicative of endothelial injury, if thoroughly validated  
3. Serologic evidence of DSAs (HLA or other antigens):  
• Biopsies suspicious for ABMR on the basis of meeting criteria 1 and 2 should 
prompt expedited DSA testing

C4d staining without 
evidence of rejection  All 3 features must be present for diagnosis4 
1. Linear C4d staining in peritubular capillaries (C4d2 or C4d3 by IF on frozen sections, or 
C4d >0 by IHC on paraffin sections)  
2. g = 0, ptc = 0, cg = 0 (by light microscopy and by EM if available), v = 0; no TMA, no 
peritubular capillary basement membrane multilayering, no acute tubular injury (in the 
absence of another apparent cause for this)  
3. No acute cell -mediated rejection (Banff 1997 type 1A or greater) or borderline changes  
Category 3: Borderline changes  
Suspicious for acute 
TCMR  • Foci of tubulitis  (t1, t2, or t3) with minor interstitial inflammation (i0 or i1) or interstitial 
inflammation (i2, i3) with mild (t1) tubulitis; retaining the i1 threshold for borderline 
from Banff 2005 is permitted although this must be made transparent in reports and publications  
• No intimal arteritis (v  = 0) 
Category 4: TCMR  
Acute TCMR Grade  IA. Sign ificant interstitial inflammation (>25% of nonsclerotic cortical parenchyma, i2 , or i3) 
and foci of moderate tubulitis (t2)  
IB. Significant interstitial inflammation (>25% of nonsclerotic cortical parenchyma, i2, or i3) and foci of severe tubulitis (t3)  IIA. Mild to moderate intimal arteritis (v1) with or without interstitial inflammation and tubulitis  
IIB. Severe intimal art eritis comprising >25% of the luminal area (v2) with or without 
interstitial inflammation and tubulitis  
III. Transmural arteritis and/or arterial fibrinoid change and necrosis of medial smooth muscle 
cells with accompanying lymphocytic inflammation (v3)  
Chronic active TCMR  Chronic allograft arteriopathy (arterial intimal fibrosis with mononuclear cell infiltration in 
fibrosis, formation of neointima); note that such lesions may represent chronic active ABMR 
as well as TCMR; the latter m ay also be manifest in the tubulointerstitial compartment  
Category 5: Interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy  
Grade  I. Mild interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy ( ≤25% of cortical area)  
II. Moderate interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy (26 -50% of cortical area)  
III. Severe interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy (>50% of cortical area)  
Category 6: Other changes not considered to be caused by acute or chronic rejection  
 BK virus nephropathy  
Posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorders  Calcineurin inhibitor nephrotoxicity  
Acute tubular injury  Recurrent disease  
De novo glomerulopathy (other than transplant glomerulopathy)  
Pyelonephritis  
Drug -induced interstitial nephritis  
1. It should be noted that these arterial lesions may be indicative of ABMR, TCMR, or mixed ABMR/TCMR. The v lesions are only scored in arteries having a continuous media with 2  or more smooth muscle layers.  
2. Lesions of chronic, active ABMR can range from pri marily active lesions with early TG evident only by EM (cg1a) to those 
with advanced TG and other chronic changes in addition to active microvascular inflammation. In the absence of evidence 
of current/recent antibody interaction with the endothelium, the term “active” should be omitted; in such cases, DSAs may be present at the time of biopsy or at any previous time after transplantation.  
3. Seven or more layers in 1 cortical peritubular capillary and 5  or more in 2 additional capillaries, avoiding portions cut 
tangentially.  
4. The clinical significance of these findings may be quite different in grafts exposed to anti -blood group antibodies 
(ABO- incompatible allografts), in which they do not appear to be injurious to the graft and may represent accommodation; 
however, with anti -HLA antibodies, such lesions may progress to chronic ABMR and more outcome data are needed.  
ABMR = antibody -mediated rejection; cg = glomerular double contours; DSA = donor -specific antibody; EM = electron 
microscopy; g = glomerulitis; HLA = human leukocyte antigen; i = inflammation; IF = immunofluorescence; IHC = immunohistochemistry; ptc = peritubular capillaritis; t = tubulitis; TCMR = T cell -mediated rejection; TG = transplant 
glomerulopathy; TMA = thrombotic microangiopathy; v = int imal arteritis.

aah0 No typical lesions of calcineurin inhibitor -related arteriolopathy  
aah1 Replacement of degenerated smooth muscle cells by hyaline deposits in only 1 arteriole, without 
circumferential involvement  
aah2 Replacement of degenerated smooth muscle cells by hyaline deposits in more than 1 arteriole, without 
circumferential involvement  
aah3 Replacement of degenerated smooth muscle cells by hyaline deposits with circumferential involvement, 
independent of the number of arterioles involved  
Quantitative criteria for vascular fibrous intimal thickening: cv score  
cv0 No chronic vascular changes  
cv1 Vascular narrowing of up to 25% luminal area by fibrointimal thickening  
cv2 Vascular narrowing of 26 -50% luminal area by fibrointimal thickening  
cv3 Vascular narrowing of >50% luminal area by fibrointimal thickening  
Quantitative criteria for interstitial fibrosis: ci score  
ci0 Interstitial fibrosis in up to 5% of cortical area  
ci1 Interstitial fibrosis in 6 -25% of cortical area (mild interstitial fibrosis)  
ci2 Interstitial fibrosis in 26 -50% of cortical area (moderate interstitial fibrosis)   
ci3 Interstitial fibrosis in >50% of cortical area (severe interstitial fibrosis)  
Quantitative criteria for tubular atrophy: ct score  
ct0 No tubular atrophy  
ct1 Tubular atrophy involving up to 25% of the area of cortical tubules (mild tubular atrophy)  
ct2 Tubular atrophy involving 26 -50% of the area of cortical tubules (moderate tubular atrophy)  
ct3 Tubular atrophy involving in >50% of the area of cortical tubules (severe tubular atrophy)  
aah = hyaline arteriolar thickening; ah = arteriolar hyalinosis; cg = glomerular double contours; ci = interstitial fibrosis;

basem ent membrane; i = inflammation; i -IFTA = interstitial inflammation in areas of interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy; 
mm = mesangial matrix expansion; PAS = periodic acid -Schiff; ptc = peritubular capillaritis; PTC = peritubular capillary; 
t = tubulitis ; ti = total inflammation; v = intimal arteritis.

SYNDROME  
Cytomegalovirus Syndrome Definition  
Cytomegalovirus (CMV)  syndrome is defined as CMV viremia identified by quantitative  
polymerase chain reaction  (or phosphoprotein 65  kD antigenemia and other sponsor -approved 
CMV assays) and at least 1  of the following criteria: a fever ≥ 38°C ; new onset severe malaise; 
leukopenia on 2  successive measurements separated by at least 24 hours (defined as white blood 
cell [WBC] count of <3500 cells/ µL if presymptomatic count was  ≥4000 cells/µL or a decrease in 
WBC of >20% if the presym ptomatic count was <4000 cells/µL); atypical lymp hocytosis of ≥ 5%; 
thrombocytopenia (defined as a pl atelet count of <100,000 cells/µL if the prior count was 
≥115,000 cells/µL or a decrease of >20%  if the prior count was <115,000 cells/ µL); or elevation 
of hepatic transaminases to ≥ 2 × upper limit of normal.

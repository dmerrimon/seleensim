SCHEMA  
 
Purpose:  The purpose of  this research  study is  to assess  the feasibility  of the 
“mLab  App Plus,”  which  provides an imaging algorithm  that 
incorporates  a duplex  HIV/syphilis point -of-care (POC)  test. 
Design/  
Evaluation:  We will conduct  a randomized control  feasibility  trial (RCT)  of 
participants  randomized  to two study  arms:  1) the mLab  App Plus 
and 2) standard of  care (SOC).  
Intervention:  • mLab  App Plus 
• HIV/syphilis  point  of care test (DPP® HIV-Syphilis)  
Study  Duration:  This will be a 3-month  study.  
Population:  Men who have sex with men (MSM)  and transgender  women  
(TGW) who have  sex with men ages 18 -39 in New  York City (NYC)  
Sample  Size:  40 YMSM  and TGW  (18-39 years)  
Participating  
Sites:  Columbia University  School  of Nursing (Washington Heights,  NYC)  
Data Collection:  We will use self-report  surveys  to measure demographics,  knowledge,  
attitudes,  skills,  and behaviors.  We will measure  testing uptake with  data 
collected  from the app and through  survey  collection.  
Summary  
MSM,  especially  young  MSM  (YMSM),  and TGW  have  some  of the highest  rates  of HIV and 
syphilis  diagnoses  in the United  States.  The goal of this proposed  feasibility  study  is to pilot the 
mLab  App Plus to assess  YMSM’s  and YTGW’s  abilities  to perform  and interpret  self-tests for 
HIV and syphilis  and consequently increase  the number  of YMSM  and YTGW  who initiate  self- 
testing  for HIV and syphilis.  
 
1.0 INTRODUCTION  
 
1.1 Background  Information and Prior  Research  
 
From  2018  to 2019,  the rate of syphilis increased  by 11.2%  (1) It has increased  steadily  since  
2000  especially  among men,  in which MSM  bear a disproportionate  majority  of cases  (47%  of 
all cases  were  among  MSM in 2019)  (2, 3). 
 
HIV and syphilis  rates  continue  to rise among  YMSM  (2, 3). While  MSM  account  for only about  
2% of the US population  (4), they  are most  affected  by HIV, constituting 56%  of PLWH  (2). 
Moreover,  the rate of syphilis  among  MSM  is profoundly  elevated,  at least 100 times higher  than 
that in men who have  sex with women and even  higher  among  YMSM  (5, 6). Importantly,  syphilis  
makes it  easier  to both acquire and transmit  HIV, and about  half of MSM  who have syphilis  are 
co-infected  with HIV (5).

The risk of  syphilis and HIV continues  to rise in YMSM  in New York City, the study  site (6). Given  
these epidemiologic risk  factors  for HIV and syphilis,  there is a strong scientific premise  for this 
pilot study  that proposes  to test innovative and effective HIV  and STI  testing,  prevention,  and 
treatment  models.  Given  that approximately  17% of MSM  living  with HIV  in the U.S. are unaware  
of their status and significant  comorbid  syphilis in that population,  both pathogens  may be 
simultaneously  transmitted  (7). The increasing  number of  syphilis  diagnosed  in MSM  
highlights  the importance of  STI control  in this population,  not just for the health of  the patient,  
but also for prevention  of HIV and syphilis in uninfected  persons.  
 
The number  of youths living  with HIV continues  to rise, and they are disproportionately  
represented  at each  stage of  the care continuum.  Most  relevant  to this application,  it is 
estimated  that less than  half of HIV-infected youth in the US have  been  diagnosed with HIV, 
and AIDS -related  deaths  among  youth  have  increased  over the past decade despite  decreased  
death  rates among all other  age groups.  Simply  stated  – youth unaware  they are 
HIV+  cannot  get the treatment  they need  to stay healthy  and may infect  others without  knowing  
it. Thus,  increasing  access to HIV testing  is a critical  component  to engaging and identifying  
YMSM  and YTGW  with undiagnosed HIV,  linking them  to care,  and lowering forward HIV  
transmission  (7-9). 
 
YMSM  and YTGW,  and specifically Blacks  and Latinos,  are disproportionately infected with  
HIV. To illustrate,  in 2015,  youth comprised  22% of all new cases of  HIV (10). Of these youth,  
81% of infections  occurred among  YMSM  (10). Among  YTGW  under  the age of 29, limited  
data exists,  but community -based samples  suggest  an HIV prevalence  from 5% to 20% in 
this population (11). These  numbers  are exacerbated  in racial/ethnic  minorities.  Black men 
who have sex with men (MSM)  have  more  HIV diagnoses  than any other  racial/ethnic  group  
of MSM  (38%)  and Black YMSM  comprise  39% of these HIV  diagnoses  (10). Latino MSM  
comprise  27% of HIV diagnoses among  MSM  (7) and 7 out of 10 new HIV diagnoses  among  
Latinos.  YTGW  have  also been  disproportionately  affected by HIV with the highest  
percentage  of HIV+  test results of  any gender  category  (9). 
 
There are a number  of behavioral  and social  factors  that likely  account  for the high rates  of 
new and undiagnosed HIV  infections among  youth,  and specifically  YMSM  and YTGW.  
Engaging in receptive anal  intercourse and  a higher  likelihood  of having  partners who  may be 
at increased risk  for HIV are some  of the behavioral  factors  that potentiate  the HIV epidemic in 
youth  (6, 12, 13). Moreover,  having never  witnessed  the devastating effect  of HIV/AIDS in  the 
early  years of  the epidemic,  youth  may perceive themselves  to be at lower  risk of HIV (12). 
Social  factors including stigma,  homophobia,  and racism  may compound  those  factors;  many  
YMSM  and YTGW  feel rejected,  isolated,  and/or  lack social  support  (12, 14). Healthcare system  
factors also contribute  to the low HIV testing  rates  in youth.  Many  youths avoid contact  with 
providers who offer  HIV testing and care due to lack of  health insurance,  discomfort  with 
facilities  and services,  fear of stigmatization,  and concerns  about  confidentiality (15-17). For 
these  reasons,  many  YMSM  and YTGW  avoid HIV testing services,  making them  unaware  
that they may be infected  with HIV (7). 
 
Outreach is needed  among  YMSM  and YTGW  to engage them  in HIV  testing,  which  remains  
an important  tool in the fight against  HIV (18, 19). There  are large disparities in HIV  testing rates  
in youth  and ethnic  and racial  minorities.  Among those HIV -infected,  only 49% of YMSM  aged  
18-24 years  compared  to 66% of adults  knew  of their infection,  highlighting the need for 
improved  outreach  for testing among high -risk youth  (7, 20). Among all MSM,  54% of 
Protocol  Number:  AAAU1706  
Version  3.4 02.14.24  
8  
  
Black/African  American men knew  of their infection,  compared with 63%  of Hispanic/Latino  
men and 86%  of white  men (2, 7, 19). This  data reflects  major  racial  and ethnic disparities  and, 
therefore,  the need  for our proposed  study  that targets  enrollment  of Black  and Latino YMSM  
and YTGW  (NIMHD  priority  area)  (21, 22). Transgender  women  (TGW)  of all ages  are also 
immensely  burdened by HIV. In one study,  TGW  were  shown  to have  a lower  prevalence  of 
ever having been  tested  (35.6%)  or having been  tested in the past year (10.0%)  for HIV 
compared  to cisgender  gay and bisexual  men (61.8%  ever tested;  21.6%  tested in past  year)  
(9). TGW  have consistently low HIV testing rates  and a resultant  high percentage of  
undiagnosed infection in comparison  to the general  population,  pointing to the need  for 
interventions  to increase  the uptake  of HIV testing in this population (23-25). YMSM  and YTGW  
do not have adequate access  to HIV prevention  and testing  (9, 19) and they have  poorer  
access  to healthcare,  in general  (15, 16). The healthcare  system  is failing to test youth,  
contributing to the high percentage of  youth with undiagnosed HIV;  this is especially  true for 
YMSM  and YTGW  who are often  overlooked  by the current  healthcare  system  (15-17). As a 
result,  more Black and Latino  men end up being tested in non-clinical  settings  than White  
men,  pointing to the need for expanding non -clinical  options,  such  as self-testing,  especially  
among  racial  and ethnic  minorities (18, 21, 26). 
 
Though HIV  self-testing  may supplement  gaps  in healthcare provision,  there  are concerns  
regarding  its potential  to reduce  contact  with care providers or  in healthcare settings where  
more sensitive  tests may be warranted and other  prevention approaches,  such  as pre- 
exposure  and post -exposure  prophylaxis,  might  be delivered (27, 28). Another  concern  
frequently  cited about  the HIV self-test is that individuals who  receive  a reactive or  
preliminary  positive  test result  may be less likely  to seek or  to receive  a confirmatory  test and 
be linked  to appropriate  care (29). Findings  from a recent  RCT suggests  that when  supported  
through a helpline,  individuals with HIV  that was identified  through  self-testing  were  
adequately  and appropriately linked  to care (27). Perhaps  most  importantly,  there were no  
serious  adverse events described  in this study  or in other  HIV self-testing studies (27, 30). 
While HIV  self-testing kits can be purchased  over the counter,  we acknowledge  that there  
has been  low uptake of  HIV self-testing  among YMSM  in the US, pointing to the need  for 
technologies,  such  as the one proposed in this study,  to promote  the uptake of  the HIV  self- 
test (OraQuick  test ) (31). 
 
The implementation  of HIV self -testing for YMSM  also provides  an opportunity  for self-testing of  
another  STI prevalent  in the MSM  community:  syphilis.  MSM  comprise approximately  46% of 
cases  of concurrent  HIV and syphilis infection in  the US (3). The biological  nature of  syphilis  
infection,  specifically  syphilitic  ulcer  proliferation,  facilitates transmission of  HIV, making  it highly  
dangerous  for PLWH.  Syphilis infections in PLWH  were  also associated with higher  HIV viral 
load and lower  CD4 cell  counts,  and therefore worsen  the severity  of HIV-related symptoms  (32). 
Considering the increased harm  caused  by coinfection with  syphilis  amongst PLWH,  there is  a 
need  for increased  concurrent  testing for HIV and syphilis.  One study  showed  that uptake of  
concurrent  HIV-syphilis  testing in a healthcare  setting  was highest  amongst  people between  the 
ages  of 25-34, suggesting  a strong acceptability  of concurrent  testing  amongst  youth  (33). 
Moreover,  the study  acknowledged  the social  barriers  to concurrent  HIV-syphilis testing  
acceptance within  the healthcare  setting  and called for the development  of interventions  that 
circumvent  decision -making  burden between  providers  and high-risk patients (33). 
 
 
1.2 Prior  Research  
 
In response to the need  for interventions  to increase HIV  testing  in youth,  our study  team  developed  
Protocol  Number:  AAAU1706  
Version  3.4 02.14.24  
9  
 the mLab  App, which affords  advantages  over existing self -test options  to support  the potential  for 
higher  uptake of  the HIV  self-test. The mLab  App is  a mobile app on a phone that  is accessible using  a 
login name and password.  The app provides HIV  prevention  information,  push  notification  reminders  for 
testing,  step-by-step instructions  for using the OraQuick  HIV tests,  and an image  upload  function  so 
individuals can send an image  of their OraQuick HIV test to the study  team.  Individuals  enter  the results  
of the OraQuick test  in the app. By using the app, we are asking individuals  to help test the app's   
ability  to interpret  the results of  the OraQuick tests.  Individuals  are not able see the results  of this 
interpretation on the existing mLab  application.  If an individual  tests HIV  positive by the OraQuick HIV  
test, the mLab  app provides  information  on how to set up follow -up confirmatory  testing  within  the 
following  24 hours.  All information  that they provide  within the app is stored on  a secured server.  The 
mLab  App is derived  from extensive  participatory  based  research  (focus  groups,  design  sessions,  
usability  testing)  with young men (CDC  U01 PS003715)  (described in detail  in APPROACH:  preliminary  
study  #1) (33-35). Building  on this extensive  user-centered  design  work and the engineering  work of Dr. 
Scherr  (Co-I; see APPROACH:  preliminary  study  #3), who developed  the automated image processing  
algorithm  to provide  real-time interpretation  of smartphone  camera images  of a lateral  flow assays  for 
malaria,  (36) the mLab App extends  the algorithm  to interpret  the HIV self-test (OraQuick).  
 
The mLab App addresses  many  of the current  barriers  to self-testing kits  through  the 
integration with  a smartphone  to overcome ambiguous  test interpretations,  provides  
immediate  results  reporting,  and helps support  linkage  to care.  In addition,  the mLab  user 
interface  promotes  a holistic  diagnostic  experience because it  provides  step by step error- 
checking  with clear  picture directions.  While  in principle,  rapid  tests,  such  as the OraQuick,  
seem  simple  to interpret  (37) with weak  positive  bands or  weak control  lines,  it is all-too-often  
difficult  for users to accurately interpret  the test results,  which we found in our own research  
on the OraQuick home  test (31). Beyond  diagnosis,  the mLab  App provides information  
facilitating  linkage  to care for those who  test HIV-positive and educates users  on the 
importance of  follow -up testing and prevention  services  for those who  test HIV-negative.  
 
We conducted preliminary studies  to support  the usage of  this intervention  for young men:  
 
1) Dr. Schnall  led a CDC  cooperative agreement  (U01 PS004975)  using critical  iterative  
end-user feedback to design  a mobile app for promoting HIV  prevention behaviors in 
high-risk MSM  (35). The methodological  details,  associated  findings,  and final Design  
Document  have been  widely  disseminated  (38). Findings  from this study  guided  the 
content  of the mLab App,  which is being refined in this proposed study.  
Dr. Schnall  conducted  a study  using  in-depth  interviews,  observations,  and a think- 
aloud protocol  to understand  high-risk young adults'  use of the rapid  (HIV)  self-test. Our 
study  incorporated  a performance  record  to carefully identify  competency in  self- 
administration  of the test (31). This study  provided  evidence of the perceived  usefulness  
of the self-test by young adults,  especially in light  of their concerns  about  lack of  privacy  
in medical  settings.  Notably,  only one (of 21) participant  followed all of the instructions  
for using the test. The policy implications  of this finding are important  since  the Food  & 
Drug  Administration  (FDA) Requirements  for labelling  and packaging  are critical  for the 
safe use of devices,  but at the same time,  end-users’  abilities to understand and use 
these  package inserts,  especially in  stressful  situations,  must  be better considered  (31). 
To address this need,  we developed the mLab App  which provides  step by step 
instructions  on the smartphone  screen  and also an imaging algorithm  for interpretation  
of test results  so that the participants  can be less burdened by the interpretation  of fuzzy  
red lines,  a common and well-known limitation  to the self-test. 
 
2) Dr. Scherr’s  team  published its work on smartphone  integration of  a number  of existing  
Protocol  Number:  AAAU1706  
Version  3.4 02.14.24  
10  
 technologies  as an attractive  tool for standardized  detection and  reporting of  infectious  
diseases.  Dr. Scherr  demonstrated that  using an unmodified  mobile phone to 
photograph  rapid  detection lateral  flow assays is superior  to visual  interpretation  by 
inexperienced users.  In short,  the photo imaging algorithm  has been  successfully  used  
with lateral  flow assay  tests for malaria with untrained  users in  non-clinical settings (36). 
Dr. Scherr’s work demonstrated that an automated  image processing algorithm  has an  
improved limit  of detection over  a commercially  available lateral  flow reader  and reduced  
reporting  errors inherent  in visual  test interpretation.  
 
To understand  high-risk YMSM  and YTGW’s  plans  for using  the mLab  App, barriers  to use, 
and feasibility  of using the imaging algorithm  (the mLab),  Drs. Schnall  and Scherr  conducted  a 
mixed methods observational  study  among  18 YMSM  and YTGW  (mean  age 24) who have  all 
engaged in high-risk sexual  behavior  (unprotected anal sex) in the past 3 months.  Participants  
used  the mLab  App and then completed  a follow -up survey  and an in -depth interview.  
Participants  completed  the Health -ITUES  survey  and rated  the mLab  App as Impact  on health  
(4.3 out of 5), Useful  (4.4 out  of 5) and Easy  to Use (4.4 out  of 5). We collected  paradata as  part 
of our pilot study  and collected  time stamps,  pages accessed,  test image,  type of Internet  
browser,  operating system,  and the smartphone device.  Following the survey,  we conducted  in- 
depth interviews  to understand high -risk youth’s plans  for using the mLab App and barriers  to 
use. All of the participants reported  this would be  a very useful  tool for high-risk youth and 
thought  most  youth would  want to use the mLab  App. They  also all indicated  they would seek  
follow -up care if  they themselves  tested  positive and saw the principal  advantages of  the mLab  
App as being convenient  and portable  and an enabler  for promoting  uptake of  HIV testing.  In 
particular,  participants  noted  that the mLab would  be especially  helpful  to youth who  did not 
have  a close  relationship with  a provider  or were concerned about  potential  stigma  from a 
provider  regarding their  sexual  behavior.  Participants also provided useful  feedback on the user 
interface  with suggestions (39). 
 
1.3 Rationale  
 
In response  to the mLab  App study  and the scientific  evidence  of need  for at-home  syphilis  
POC  testing  among  YMSM  and YTGW,  we propose  to implement  the mLab  App Plus  to 
assess  YMSM’s  and YTGW’s  abilities  to perform  and interpret  self-tests for HIV and syphilis  
and consequently  increase  the number  of YMSM  and YTGW  who initiate  self-testing  for HIV 
and syphilis.  
 
We propose  the following  Specific  Aims : 
 
1: Examine the feasibility  of using the DPP® HIV-Syphilis  test as a self-test to improve  
uptake  and access  to STI testing.  
 
2: Estimate  the effect  sizes  for the mLab  App Plus for improving  testing  uptake  in YMSM  and 
YTGW.  
 
2.0 STUDY  OBJECTIVES  
 
2.1 Primary  Objectives  
The primary  objective  of this study  is to pilot the use of added  syphilis  testing to mLab  and 
determine its  feasibility  among YMSM  and YTGW  for further  use and study,  recruiting  40 
YMSM  and YTGW  into the RCT.  We will assess demand and a limited effect  size to predict  
Protocol  Number:  AAAU1706  
Version  3.4 02.14.24  
11  
 usefulness  for a larger  study  of the application.  Because  DPP® HIV-Syphilis tests are not yet approved by 
the FDA for self-administration,  participants will  complete  their self-tests at our clinic in  Washington  Heights  
under  the supervision  of a trained clinician.  The clinician will  be qualified  to use the device according  to the 
approved  Instructions  for Use (IFU)  and will  complete  the test in a manner  consistent  with the point  of care 
(POC),  non-CLIA  waived label  of the test. Thus, we will also be assessing participants’  abilities  to self- 
administer  and interpret  DPP® HIV-Syphilis  tests.  If participants are  unable  to self-administer,  apprehensive,  
or incorrectly  use the DPP® HIV-Syphilis  test as per the IFU, the clinician will  intervene and conduct  the test 
on the participant.  
3.0 STUDY  DESIGN  
 
3.1 Randomized  Control  Trial 
 
We will conduct  a small -scale  digital  RCT to evaluate  the feasibility  of the mLab  App Plus 
and testing/linkage  to care uptake as compared  to the control  arm (receiving SOC).  We will 
enroll  40 YMSM  and YTGW  (ages 18 -39) who report  being negative  for HIV and syphilis,  or 
whose  statuses are unknown,  and randomize  them  into the intervention or  control  condition.  
The trial includes  screening,  a baseline  appointment,  and a 3-month  follow -up   
appointment.  
 
Intervention  Condition : Participants  randomized  to intervention will  be provided  with the mLab  
App Plus,  and a box of condoms.  The intervention arm  will also complete  two HIV/Syphilis  Ab 
Combo  Rapid  Tests  (DPP®  HIV-Syphilis  Test)  at their baseline (1st test) and 3 -month  follow - 
up (2nd test) appointments in the clinic  (more  details in section  5.4 Intervention/Investigation  
Procedures).  
 
Control  Condition : Participants  randomized  to standard  care will be sent  an email  with links  
to mobile -optimized online prevention information,  including PrEP  and HIV/STI  testing  
information  found  on the CDC website,  and a box of condoms  (40). 
 
 
3.2 Study  Randomization  
 
After providing  informed  consent,  participants will  be randomized  to study  arms in a 1:1 
ratio of  intervention  to control  arms.  To reduce opportunities  for selection bias,  we will  use 
a variable  permuted  randomization  block design where  block size itself  is randomly  
selected  (i.e., blocks  of four to eight).  The advantage of  a permuted  block design is that  
treatment  assignment  is pre-determined  before  the trial begins and assignment  remains  
static throughout  the trial. Both groups  will receive  standard care HIV/STI  testing -related  
risk reduction counseling,  a box of condoms,  and PrEP  assessment.  The intervention  
group will  self-administer  their first DPP®  HIV-Syphilis  Test under  the supervision  of a 
trained clinician  at baseline and again at  their 3-month  follow -up. No control  group  
participant  will be offered HIV  or Syphilis  testing in order  to observe intervention  outcome.  
 
4.0 Study  Population  
 
4.1 Inclusion  Criteria  for Aims  
 
Individuals who  meet  the following  initial  criteria  are eligible  to proceed  to the confirmatory  
study  screening:  
• 18-39 years  of age (see justification  below)  
• Assigned  male  sex at birth and identify  as (1) a man or (2) a trans  woman  
Protocol  Number:  AAAU1706  
Version  3.4 02.14.24  
12  
 (e.g.,  MTF,  YTGW)  
• Understand  and read English or  Spanish  
• Self-identify  as any race or ethnicity  
• Substantial  risk for acquiring  HIV infection per  CDC guidance  (e.g.,  Sexual  partner  with HIV  
and/or  recent  bacterial  STD and/or  high number  of sexual  partners  and/or  history  of inconsistent  
or no condom  use and/or  commercial  sex work)  (1, 2, 41) 
• All participants must  report  having sex with a man/men  
• Smartphone  ownership  
• Self-report  being HIV -negative or  unknown  status  
• Self-report  being negative for syphilis  or unknown  status  
• Not having been tested  for HIV or syphilis in the past 3 months  (e.g.,  therefore  
being somewhat  outside of  the current  CDC  testing recommendations  for high-risk 
populations – see below)  
• Understand  the limitations  of the duplex  lateral flow  test and the mLab App  Plus (e.g.,  a 
confirmatory  test is needed  and self-test must  be performed in the presence  of a qualified  clinician)  
 
4.1.1  Considerations of  Age for Inclusion  Criteria  
 
The proposed inclusion  ages  of 18-39 captures  the upper  range of  the greatest increase in  
new infections  (42), and the youngest  age is the average age when  sexual  initiation begins  
(43, 44). 
-54). 
 
4.2 Exclusion Criteria  for Aims  
 
Individuals who  meet  any of the following  criteria will  be excluded  from the study:  
• Persons who have a known  diagnosis of  HIV and/or  syphilis  
• Persons  for whom  the investigators  determine  that participation  may be detrimental  
to the participant  or to the study  (e.g.,  severe  cognitive  deficit)  
• Persons diagnosed with  Systematic Lupus Erythematosus,  as their medical  
condition could affect  the results of  the DPP  HIV-Syphilis  test 
• Persons who are unable or unwilling to provide consent  for study  participation  
 
4.3 Co-enrollment  Criteria  
 
Participants are ineligible  for participation if  they are currently  enrolled in any other  HIV or 
syphilis  testing -related  research  study.  
 
4.4 Recruitment  Procedures  
Protocol  Number:  AAAU1706  
Version  3.4 02.14.24  
13  
 We will likely  employ  a multi-modal  recruitment  strategy.  The research  team has extensive  
experience  recruiting YMSM  and YTGW  of color  into research  studies,  including the pilot  
study  of the mLab  App, in which 12/18 participants (67%)  were  non-white  and the 
preliminary  study in which 70%  were non -white  (CDC  U01 PS004975).  
 
We have  used  a variety  of recruitment  venues  for other  similar  studies and  maintain strong  
working relationships with online  advertising  vendors and local community -based  
organizations.  Although  online venues are constantly  evolving,  in the past major  categories of  
recruitment  have included social  network sites  (e.g.,  Facebook,  Instagram,  Twitter);  online  
sexual  networking apps  (e.g.,  Grindr,  Scruff);  and banner  advertisements  on other  websites  
frequented by MSM  (e.g.,  POZ).  We will recruit  young men through posting  flyers  and 
promoting the study  through  community  partners.  Those  recruited  through  these  flyers will  be 
directed  to an online web  survey  (e.g.,  REDCap) for eligibility  screening.  
 
4.4.1  Recruitment  Limitations,  Anticipated  Problems  and Alternative  Solutions  
 
Limitations  
Some  limitations  or anticipated problems with recruitment  may involve  the efficacy  of the 
utilized ads.  In addition,  participant  interest  may vary from population  to population.  There   
is always  the possibility  of restricted  recruitment  as it pertains  to accessing and promoting  
studies in public spaces  (i.e., schools,  parks,  etc.).  We will also inform  the study  participants  
upon  enrollment  that the goal of the mLab  App Plus is for self-testing and NOT for      
partner  testing/sero -sorting.  In order  to ensure  that DPP®  HIV-Syphilis  Tests are used  only 
on the study  participants  themselves,  participants will  not be given  DPP®  HIV-Syphilis  tests 
to take home.  Participants will  receive  a test at our clinic in Washington Heights where  a 
provider  will be present  and watch  them  self-administer  the test. Because the DPP®  HIV- 
Syphilis  tests are not  yet FDA approved as  self-tests, it is possible  that participants will  be 
unable  to perform  the test on themselves,  and will need  the clinician  to administer  it for 
them.  
 
Alternative Solutions  
Some  alternative solutions to participant  recruitment  may include,  but are not limited  to email  
blasts,  posted  flyers,  and in -network recruitment.  With regard  to partner  testing,  we will  
suggest  that participants  who have partners who are interested in testing should  contact  the 
study  team  for more information  on HIV testing.  If participants  are apprehensive about  self- 
administering the DPP®  HIV-Syphilis  test, they will have  the option  to ask the clinician  to 
administer  it for them.  
 
4.5 Screening  Procedures  
 
Interested  participants will  be sent  a RedCap  link to the mLab  App Plus screener  to fill out 
online.  If found  eligible,  they will then have  a visit at our clinic in Washington Heights with  
one of our investigators  to answer  questions and  consent  to enroll  in the study.  After 
receiving  written  consent,  the study  team will randomize participants  to one of the two arms.  
After signing the consent  and being randomized,  they will be considered  to be “enrolled”  
into the study.  
 
4.6 Informed  Consent  
 
We will be using electronic online informed  consent  procedures  for enrolling YMSM  and 
Protocol  Number:  AAAU1706  
Version  3.4 02.14.24  
14 YTGW  into the study.  Interested  participants will  verbally  consent  to screening.  If screened  as 
eligible,  participants will  complete  a consent  form for enrollment  into the study  at the beginning  
of their baseline session.  Prior to randomization,  participants will  read and sign the consent  
form provided  to them  by study  staff onsite.  The informed  consent  form provides  details     
of the study  procedure,  risks,  benefits,  site contact  information,  and the nature  of 
confidentiality  and voluntary  participation.  The consent  process  also covers  information on  the 
study  and compensation  for time.  The same  consent  form will be given  to all study  
participants.  Participants  consent  to be randomized to any of the two aims  for study  purposes.  
Before a participant  signs the informed consent  forms,  staff will review  the forms,  ask 
if the participant  understands  the content  of the consent  forms,  and answer  any questions.  
Participants will  be given  a copy  of the informed consent  forms  for their records.  
5.0 Study  Procedures  
5.1 Enrollment  Procedures  
After successfully  providing  consent,  the participant  will be randomized  to a study  arm and 
then complete a computer  self-administered baseline survey  (further  described in section  
5.4). After completing the baseline survey,  both groups will  receive standard care HIV/STI  
testing -related  risk reduction counseling, a box of condoms,  and PrEP  assessment.  
Participants who are  randomized  to the intervention arm  will be given  a DPP®  HIV-Syphilis  
Test at their baseline  appointment,  which  they will self-administer  in the presence  of a 
qualified  clinician.  
5.2 Locator/Contact  Information  
At the participant’s  baseline study  visit, participants will  be asked  to provide  contact  
information  for follow -up assessments:  this information will  be entered into  REDCap.  We will 
collect  each participant’s  cell phone  number,  email  address,  as well  as encourage  them  to 
share  their social  media  handles  (e.g.,  Snapchat,  Instagram,  Twitter  Facebook,  WhatsApp,  
and/or  Skype usernames).  Participants will  be asked if  it is okay  to mention  the name of  the 
project  and method(s)  of study  communication preferred when  sending reminder  (e.g.,  text 
messaging,  email,  phone  call, leave voicemail).  Study  staff will not send  messages or  leave  
voicemail  messages  unless  explicitly  permitted  to do so by the participant.  If permission is 
given  to leave voice  messages,  site staff will assure  participants  that messages left  will not 
include  any protected  health information or  information  related  to study participation.  Contact  
information will  be maintained  using the same  confidential  data management  practices used  
for all study  data.  
5.3 Randomization  Procedures  
After providing  informed  consent,  participants will  be randomized  to study  arms in a 1:1 
ratio of  intervention  to control  arms.  To reduce opportunities  for selection bias,  we will  use 
a variable  permuted  randomization  block design,  where  block size itself  is randomly  
selected  (i.e., blocks  of four to eight).  The advantage of  a permuted block design is that  
treatment  assignment  is pre-determined  before  the trial begins and assignment  remains  
static  throughout  the trial (55). No control  group  participant  will be offered  HIV or Syphilis

Version  3.4 02.14.24  
15 testing in order  to observe  intervention  outcome.

assessment,  and referral  information  for clinics  that provide  PrEP.  
Baseline Visit  
The baseline  survey  will include  questions on demographics,  health literacy  (52), sexual  risk 
behaviors including  number  of men (and other  genders)  they engaged in anal or oral sex with, 
condomless anal intercourse,  and HIV/STI  testing  history  and opinions  regarding HIV/STI  
testing.  The baseline survey will  also include  questions  on PEP/PrEP use and adherence,  
drug and alcohol  use, (51) and HIV Risk Index (54). We are using REDCAP, a web-based  survey  
software package with several  benefits that  have  been  cited including data  being captured  
directly  in electronic  format  and interactive  data capture  checks  (56). This  approach will  be 
especially  beneficial  in a multi-site study.  REDCap is  a secure web -based  system  that 
provides an intuitive interface,  audit  trails,  and automated export.  REDCap  is a service  offered  
through CUIMC  Information  Technology.  Staff at Columbia University  will have  a link to the 
secure  web-based data collection  survey  tool and will be present  to assist  the participant  in 
completing the survey.  Staff will be accessible during  survey  completion  to address any 
technical  problems or  to answer  questions  participants  may have.  Staff may periodically  
check -in with the participant  to inquire about  any difficulties  that may arise in completing the 
survey.  However,  to ensure privacy,  the staff person will  not directly  observe  the full process of  
completing the survey  unless requested by the participant.  Both the baseline and 3 -month  
follow  up surveys will  be conducted  in-person.  
At the baseline study  visit, following  consent  and completion  of the baseline  questionnaire,  
participants  randomized  to the intervention  group  will be instructed on how to use the mLab  
App Plus by the investigator,  who will  create  an account  for them  during baseline.  Next,  
they will verbally  complete a DPP®  HIV-Syphilis  testing  assessment  so that study  staff 
ensures  they are aware  of the functions and limitations of  the test. Participants will  be taken  
to the CUIMC  Nurse Practitioners  clinic where  they will  be instructed  to self-administer  their 
first DPP®  HIV-Syphilis  test under  the supervision of  a trained  clinician.  The clinician will  
ensure  that the DPP®  HIV-Syphilis  test is administered  correctly  and test results are  
accurately interpreted.  The participant  will use the mLab  App Plus and the DPP®  HIV- 
Syphilis  testing  instructions  to guide  them  through  the DPP®  HIV- Syphilis  testing process  
and to help them  understand  their test results.  Participants will  be provided  with all 
necessary  materials  to complete  the test by the on-site clinician.  In the event  that the 
participant  feels  uncomfortable  or unable  to perform  the DPP®  HIV-Syphilis  test as a self- 
16 Protocol  Number:  AAAU1706  
Version  3.4 02.14.24  
test, they may ask the clinician  to administer  the test for them.  
Testing  with a DPP®  HIV-Syphilis  kit requires  that the participant  obtain  a small  drop of  blood  
using  a sterile lancet  and sample loop  and insert  it into the SampleTainer  Bottle.  Participants  
will then drop  the blood  sample  on the test strip per  the DPP®  HIV-Syphilis  test instructions.  
The participant  will then attach  the DPP Micro Reader,  a device  which interprets  the test 
results,  to the test strip.  Once the DPP Micro Reader  has finished  running the test, 
participants will  take a picture  of the DPP Micro Reader  display  screen  through  mLab App  
Plus,  which is then processed  through automated  image  processing software.  Participants  
then see their results  on their smartphone screen.  The test will likely  take around  twenty  
minutes  to complete.  For step-by-step instructions,  please  refer to the mLab App Plus  
Workflow.  The mLab  App Plus  is unique in that it allows  a person  to test themselves.  
However,  because  DPP®  HIV-Syphilis tests are  not yet approved by the FDA as self-tests,  
participants will  be required  to complete  the self-testing process  at our clinic in Washington  
Heights,  under  the supervision  of a qualified clinician.  Test results are  then stored on the 
participants’  smartphones and also securely  transmitted and stored on the REDCap Server.  
This will contribute  to the validity  of findings as participants’  reports of  testing  them selves can 
be confirmed  through  this device.  In addition,  the mLab  App Plus user  interface  can promote  
a more holistic diagnostic experience,  particularly in self -testing  because  the interface  
provides step -by-step picture directions,  and information  on linking to follow -up testing and  
prevention  services,  as appropriate.  
Upon receiving  a test result,  participants  will be directed  to another  screen  on their 
smartphone informing them  that a study  team  member  will be in contact  with them  shortly  to 
discuss  their test results.  The study  team  member  will meet  with the participant  at the clinic,  
immediately  after they have completed  their DPP®  HIV-Syphilis  test. They  will discuss  with 
the participant  what their test result  means and what it does  NOT mean.  In the event  of a 
positive test  result,  the study  team  member  will offer support  and help  the participant  set up 
an appointment  at our clinic  for confirmatory  testing.  Participants will  receive reminders on 
mLab  App Plus for their next visit prior to the 3-month  follow  up visit. 
3-Month Follow  Up Visit  
The 3-Month  Follow  Up survey  will include  questions on demographics, health literacy  (52) 
sexual  risk behaviors including number  of men (and other  genders)  they engaged in anal or 
oral sex with, and condomless anal intercourse,  as well  as questions on PEP/PrEP  use and 
adherence,  drug and alcohol  use (51), and HIV Risk Index (54). Participants  randomized  to 
both the control  arm and intervention arm  of the study  will all participate in the questionnaire  
at the 3-month  time point.  The survey will  also inquire  about  participants’      
opinions  towards HIV/STI testing since  the baseline  visit and their experiences using the 
mLab  App Plus,  if they are randomized to the intervention  arm. 
Following completion  of the survey,  intervention  arm participants will  once  again  
self-administer  the DPP®  HIV-Syphilis  test at the clinic in the presence of  a 
clinician.  They  will follow  the same  testing  procedure  as they did at baseline and a 
study  team  member  will meet  with them  to discuss results  and set  up confirmatory  
testing,  if necessary,  once they have completed  their DPP®  HIV-Syphilis  test. 
Results  are stored on their smartphone  through  the mLab App Plus and securely  
transmitted  and stored on the REDCap Server.  
6.1 Study  Evaluations  and Measures  
17 Protocol  Number:  AAAU1706  
Version  3.4 02.14.24  
6.2 Study  Outcomes  and Measures  
The primary  outcome is the number  of participants who are able to self-administer the 
DPP®  HIV-Syphilis  test with mLab  App Plus  (Table  2). A successful  self-test is defined  
as having completed  the DPP®  HIV-Syphilis  test by themselves and having accurately  
identified  and interpreted  their HIV and Syphilis statuses as determined  by the 
supervising clinician.  In the event  that the clinician,  rather  than the participant  administers  
the DPP®  HIV-Syphilis  test, the test is not recorded as  a successful  self-test. Secondary  
outcomes are also listed  in Table  2, including  information  about  linkage  to health  care 
and other  support  services.

7.1 Data Collection  and Site Monitoring  
7.2 Data  Records  
All electronic  data will be stored on  a certified environment.  The recordings  will be stored  
securely  after the data have been  analyzed  and the findings  disseminated.  The smartphone  
that is connected  to the mLab  App Plus will  require  a password.  Data will  be coded.  The PI 
and Project  Manager  will have  access  to the identifiable  data.  Study data will  be encrypted  
and stored on secure HIPAA - compliant  servers  at the CUIMC  campus.  mLab  App Plus data  
will be stored at  Vanderbilt  University.  All study  data will be kept in  password -protected  
computers or  file cabinets in locked  offices  and will  be maintained in a completely  secure  
and HIPAA -compliant  environment.  All CUIMC  servers  have  HIPAA -compliant  security.  
7.3 Data  Quality  Control  and Quality  Assurance  
Routine data  quality  control  assessments will  identify  and resolve data errors in both data  
collection  (e.g.,  surveys)  and study  documentation  (e.g.,  visit logs).  Data quality  resolutions  
will be documented  for reference.  As determined  necessary  by the PI, the study  Data Safety  
Monitoring  Board will  advise  resolutions  for data quality  concerns during Board  meetings.  
Data validation  tools  available  through  the REDCap platform  will be leveraged  to ensure  data 
quality  assurance in study data collection and documentation such that  data is checked  
against  validation  standards at  the time of input.  Quality  assurance  measures will  be routinely  
reviewed with new measures  added  as necessary  to address emerging data quality  
18 Protocol  Number:  AAAU1706  
Version  3.4 02.14.24  
concerns.  
8.1 Participant  Tracking  and Clinical  Management  
8.2 Tracking  Participants  Follow -up 
Contact  (phone  calls,  text, email,  or note as preferred by the participant)  will be made  by the 
site study  staff 3 days and  1 day prior to the follow -up visit to confirm  or reschedule an  
appointment.  Participants in the intervention arm  will also receive  a 3-month follow -up visit  
reminder  through the mLab App Plus.  The discrete contact  will thank the participants  for being  
in the program,  remind  them  of the date and time of their follow -up appointment,  and note the 
telephone number  that can be called  if rescheduling  is necessary.  Participants who  do not 
respond and cannot  be located  during the acceptable  1-month window  period are coded as  a 
missed  assessment  and attempts  to contact  them  will resume  for the next assessment.  We 
will contact  participants until they express  the desire  to be dropped  from the study.  These  
extensive  procedures will  be used  to promote participant  attendance  at the follow -up visits  and 
have  been  successful  in previous HIV  prevention studies  conducted by our  study  team.  
8.1.1 Retention  
Participants will  be asked at  the end of the screening  what would  be the best way for us to 
remind  them  of the appointment  (voice  phone,  text, e-mail).  Participant  retention  during the  
intervention will  be enhanced in several  ways.  We will offer multiple  reminders via  text, 
email,  calls,  or mLab  App Plus,  for participants randomized  to the intervention arm.  We will 
use several  approaches  that have shown success  at reducing  barriers,  including:  1) clearly  
explaining the duration of  the study;  2) collecting  multiple  contact  points (phone number,  e- 
mail, social  media username)  based on participants’  preferences;  and 3)  implementing  
consistent  study  staff follow -up with participants  to build rapport.  
8.2 Intervening  on “Social  Harm”  
If a study  participant  reports  severe depressive  symptoms  or suicidal  ideation,  we will refer the 
participants  to the local emergency  room  or mental  health  referral  facility.  
8.3 Acquisition  of HIV and/or Syphilis  Infection  while  on Study  
If a participant  receives a reactive or  indeterminate result  from the DPP®  HIV-Syphilis  test 
for their HIV and/or  Syphilis status during the course of  the study,  the study  team  will link 
them  to confirmatory  testing  on site at  the clinic.  
To facilitate  these  tasks,  study  staff must  complete the HIV/Syphilis Confirmation  Testing  
instrument  in REDCap which  should be updated  with the information  around  the preliminary  
positive,  confirmatory  test, and linkage  to care information  as it is updated.  Once HIV  and/or  
syphilis status has been  confirmed  as positive,  participants will  be withdrawn from  study.  
9.1 Statistical/Analytic  Considerations  
Protocol  Number:  AAAU1706  
Version  3.4 02.14.24  
9.2 Size Considerations and Power  Estimates  
Due to the small  sample  size (n=40),  results will  not be powered  enough  to be representative  
of the greater  population.  Our goal is to examine  feasibility  among participants and estimate  
the effect  size of  the intervention  for a future RCT.  
9.3 Data and Safety  Monitoring  
The Data and Safety  Monitoring Plan  (DSMP)  outlined  below  will adhere  to the protocol  
approved by the Single  Institutional  Review  Board (IRB)  which will  oversee the study  
activities.  A Data and Safety  Monitoring  Board will  be established after  a Notice of  Award is 
granted.  
9.3.1  Training on Human Subjects and Data and Safety  Monitoring  
All proposed  staff have participated in the Department  of Health and Human Services  
required  trainings  for conduct  of studies  that involve human  subjects  and any future study  
staff will do so upon hiring.  Training for all staff includes  (but is not  limited  to) Protection of  
Human Subjects,  Informed Consent,  Good Clinical  Practice,  Quality Management,  
Confidentiality,  and Reporting of  Adverse Events.  If any  study  staff discovers any untreated  
condition  (e.g.,  onset  of physical  or mental  health condition),  they will refer participants  to 
appropriate  treatment  immediately.  
9.3.2  Data  Management  and Data  Quality  
Columbia University  will be responsible  for computerized survey  programming  and data 
capture,  management,  and analysis.  All study  information will  be identified through  the 
Participant  Identification Number  on all forms and  computerized  files. 
9.3.3  Data  Monitoring  
Biweekly  reports  for the study  sites will  be created  by the data manager  (i.e., data monitoring  is done  
by both Columbia University  staff and Vanderbilt  University  staff)  to review  relevant  app engagement  
data,  barriers with  recruitment/enrollment  and retention,  laboratory  and medical  records,  compliance  
with the protocol,  and accuracy  and completeness of  the records.  The investigative  team  will schedule  
biweekly  conference  calls,  and these reports will  be briefly  reviewed by the team  at these  meetings.  
These  regular  reviews will  ensure  close  communication  between the research assistants,  quickly  
identify  missing  data points,  and ensure consistent  management  of any issues with the protocol  across  
sites.  Data quality will  be examined before  statistical  analyses are conducted,  including examination  of 
missing data,  assessment  of distributional  assumptions,  and identification of  outliers.  In addition  to data 
quality,  the comparability  between intervention  and control  groups will  be carefully  examined,  including  
baseline balance and differential  attritions  at all waves of  follow -up. 
20 
Protocol  Number:  AAAU1706  
Version  3.4 02.14.24  
9.3 Adverse  Events  
9.3.1  Adverse event  assessment  
We anticipate  that the Data and Safety  Monitoring Board  will define  study -specific  serious  
adverse events  (SAE)s.  While we do not anticipate any SAEs,  we will  carefully  review  safety  
and data security  and study drop -out. 
9.3.2  Adverse event  reporting  
An adverse event  (AE) is any symptom,  sign, illness or  experience that  develops or  worsens  
in severity  during the course of  the study.  Intercurrent  illnesses or  injuries  should be  regarded  
as adverse events.  Abnormal  results of  diagnostic  procedures are considered  to be adverse  
events if  the abnormality:  
•results in study  withdrawal
•is associated with a serious adverse  event
•is associated with  clinical  signs or  symptoms
•leads  to additional  treatment  or to further  diagnostic  tests
•is considered  by the investigator  to be of  clinical  significance
Serious Adverse Event  
Adverse events are classified as serious  or non-serious.  A serious  adverse event  is any AE 
that is: 
•fatal
•life-threatening
•requires  or prolongs hospital  stay
•results in persistent  or significant  disability  or incapacity
•a congenital  anomaly  or birth defect
•an important  medical  event
Important  medical  events are  those  that may not be immediately  life threatening but  are clearly  
21 
Protocol  Number:  AAAU1706  
Version  3.4 02.14.24  
of major  clinical  significance.  They  may jeopardize  the participant’s  health  and may require  
intervention  to prevent  one of the other  serious  outcomes  noted  above.  For example,  drug 
overdose  or abuse,  a seizure  that did not result  in in-patient  hospitalization,  or intensive  
treatment  of bronchospasm  in an emergency  department  would  typically  be considered  serious.  
All adverse  events that do not meet  any of the criteria  for serious  should  be regarded  as non- 
serious adverse events . 
We will follow  the guidelines  of the IRB that require  investigators  to promptly  notify  the IRB 
(within  1 week  from awareness  of the occurrence)  when  an adverse  event  (AE) or serious  
adverse event  (SAE)  meets  the definition of  an Unanticipated Problem  (UP).  
The IRB requires  that any event  that is unexpected,  related or  possibly  related  to the 
research intervention,  and suggests  that the research places  subjects  or others  at a greater  
risk of harm  (including physical,  psychological,  economic or  social  harm)  than was previously  
known  or recognized  must  be reported.  Events  that are unrelated to the research  intervention  
do not have  to be reported to the IRB; however,  we will report  these  to the monitoringentity  
and Centers  for Disease  Control  and Prevention  (CDC).  Risks  that are described in the 
protocol  and consent  form do not  have  to be reported unless  the expected  event  occurs  more  
frequently  or is more  severe  than expected.  One exception  to this rule is in the case of  a 
death.  All deaths  must  be reported whether  or not the death was related  to the research.  
An unanticipated adverse device effect  (UADE)  is defined as  “any serious  adverse  effect on 
health or  safety  or any life-threatening problem  or death caused by, or associated with,  a 
device,  if that effect,  problem,  or death was not previously identified in nature,  severity,  or 
degree  of incidence in the investigational  plan or application  (including  a supplementary  plan 
or application),  or any other  unanticipated  serious  problem  associated with  a device  that 
relates  to the rights,  safety,  or welfare  of subjects”  (In accordance with 21 CFR  812.3(s)).  
In accordance  with 21 CFR 812, UADEs will  promptly  be reported  to the FDA and IRB, but no 
later than 10 working days after  the investigator  first learns  of the event.  
9.4 Data  Analysis  Plan 
All multivariate analyses  will be preceded  by standard  descriptive bivariate analyses  to 
describe  the key variables and  relationships among them.  These  analyses  will include  
means,  frequency  tables,  histograms,  and examination  of distributions.  Frequencies  and 
rates  of HIV/syphilis  tests,  as well  as corresponding confidence intervals,  will be 
calculated  for each  arm (mLab  App Plus vs.  Standard of  Care  (Control)).  Logistic  
regression  models will  be used  to compare in  the likelihood of  having HIV/STI  tests 
between  the mLab  App Plus arm  and the standard  clinic -based  testing arm.  
9.5 Missing Data  
Prior to performing any outcome analyses,  we will  evaluate  the amount,  reasons,  and 
patterns of  missing data.  Missing data unrelated  to the outcome of  interest  will be considered  
missing completely at  random,  and complete case analysis  will still generate  unbiased  
estimates.  We will conduct  sensitivity  analyses  to compare  estimates of  treatment  effects  with 
and without multiple imputation  to assess  the effect  of missing  data on statistical  inference.  
22 
Protocol  Number:  AAAU1706  
Version  3.4 02.14.24  
We propose a GLMM  to analyze data,  the main  advantages being unbiased estimates when  
there  are missing  outcomes during the follow -up period  if the probability  of missing  is not  
related  to the outcome value.  For the missing  values  at the baseline  or partial  baseline  
collected  data,  we will use a multiple  imputation  approach. Models  will also be run on the raw, 
non-imputed data with  full information  maximum  likelihood estimation.  Inferences  for the trial 
arm, wave,  and interaction between  trial arm and wave  do not differ  between  the analyses of  
the raw and multiply imputed  data.  Rates of  reduction will  be calculated  from population - 
averaged  rates,  which control  for all  other  covariates in the multivariable  model.  Models will  
be calculated  by using the GLIMMIX and MIANALYZE  procedures in SAS, version  9.4, and 
model  fit will be evaluated by diagnostic statistics  and residual  plots.  
10.0 Human  Subjects  Protections  
10.1 Informed  Consent  
The informed consent  of each  participant  will be obtained in accordance with  21 CFR Part 50 
and the Declaration of  Helsinki  before protocol -specified procedures  are carried out.  An 
investigator  will obtain  the participant’s written informed consent  prior to any study -related  
procedures.  Consent  will be documented  by the dated  signature of  the subject.  The signature  
confirms  that the consent  is based on information  that has been  understood.  Each participant's  
signed  informed  consent  form will be kept on file by the investigators  for possible inspection  by 
regulatory  authorities.  
The study  plan,  advertisements,  or recruitment  letters,  lay description of  the study,  and all 
consent  forms will  be submitted  to the IRB following proposal  acceptance  and prior to study  
initiation.  Dr. Schnall  will be responsible  for obtaining IRB approval  for this study.  Recruitment  
for study  participation will  occur  following IRB approval.  The investigators will determine  
eligibility  for inclusion,  explain  the purpose of  the study,  answer  any questions,  and obtain e- 
consent  from the participants.  Patients who  agree  to participate will  sign a consent  form.  
Potential  risks and strategies  for risk management  will be carefully  explained as part of 
informed consent  procedures.  All HIPAA requirements will  be applied  to this study.  
We will assure potential  participants in  these  study activities  that their willingness  to 
participate and/or  to complete  the study  activities  will not have  an impact  on their  participation  
in other  aspects  of the study  or on their  employment  or student  status at  study  sites.  
10.2 Vulnerable  Subjects:  Protecting  Against/Minimizing  Potential  Risk 
Ethnic and racial  minority  populations will  be enrolled.  While  this group  is considered  a 
vulnerable  population,  the study  team has considerable experience  enrolling these  
participants.  The study will be conducted according to Good  Clinical  Practice  guidelines,  the 
U.S. Code of  Federal  Regulations  (CFR)  Title 21 CFR (Part  50 – Protection of  Human  
Subjects and Part 56 – Institutional  Review  Boards)  and the Declaration of  Helsinki.  
10.3 Risks  
10.3.1  General  risks  
There  may be risks or discomforts in participating  in this study.  Participants  may feel uncomfortable  
with completing some  questions in  the survey.  Participants  may skip any HIV/STI  information or  
23 
Protocol  Number:  AAAU1706  
Version  3.4 02.14.24  
questions  that may make  them  feel uncomfortable  or stop the research  procedure.  People  around  may 
observe  participants  using  the mLab  App Plus.  If participants  are concerned  about  people  seeing  them  
use of mLab App Plus,  it is important  that they access the application in private  location.  
10.3.2  Loss of  confidentiality  
A risk of  taking  part in this study is  the possibility  of a loss of confidentiality  or privacy.  Loss 
of confidentiality  or privacy  means  having personal  information  shared  with someone who is 
not on the study  team  and was not  supposed  to see or know  about  your information.  
10.3.3  Venipuncture  
There is a small  risk of  local hematoma  or infection associated with blood sampling.  On rare 
occasions,  drawing  blood  can cause dizziness,  presyncope,  and even  syncope.  
10.4 Benefits  
10.4.1  Potential  Benefits  of the Proposed  Research  to Research Participants and  Others  
The potential  benefits  to an individual  participant  in the study  are not known.  The potential  
benefits  of the study  to others  could  be considerable.  If our hypotheses  are true, this study  
will make a significant  contribution  towards preventing HIV  and syphilis in YMSM.  
This study  has not  been  designed  for the direct  benefit  of its participants;  however,  there  are 
several  ways in which  they may derive benefit.  The proposed  research will  increase  
knowledge  of HIV and syphilis testing among  YMSM.  The knowledge  gained  will contribute  
to the body  of knowledge  regarding the use of health information  technology  for improving  
the lives of MSM  at risk for HIV and syphilis.  The avoidance of  HIV and syphilis  through  
study  participation will  be a significant  personal  benefit  to participants.  
10.4.2  Importance of  Knowledge  to be Gained  
The knowledge  gained  from this research will  enable  the scientific  community,  clinicians,  and 
high- risk populations  to prevent  new HIV and syphilis infections in the US. 
10.5 Participant  Privacy  and Confidentiality  
10.5.1  Access to individually  identified private  information  about  human  subjects  
Access  to individually  identified  private information about  human  subjects will  be limited  to 
research  team  members  who collect  and manage the data,  study  staff,  site principal  
investigators and the Principal  Investigator.  Coded data will  be accessible  to all members of  the 
research  team  involved in the data analysis.  Our study  team  is extremely  prudent  in keeping  
participant  data secure  and confidential.  All laboratory  specimens,  evaluation  forms,  reports,  
and other  records will  be identified by a unique  coded number  to maintain participant  
confidentiality.  The material,  records,  and data obtained  through participation  in the study will  
be specifically  for research purposes.  Existing health  records  may be used  with the permission  
of the participants.  Materials will  be obtained  by trained  clinical  staff at each  study  site. Data will 
24 
Protocol  Number:  AAAU1706  
Version  3.4 02.14.24  
be stored using Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap)  at each  respective performance  
site, and then the completely  deidentified data will  be merged  at CUIMC.  All laboratory  
specimens will  be identified only  by the identification number.  The code  linking the participant  
identification  number  to participant  identifying information  (name,  address,  etc.) is maintained  
at the clinical  sites through REDCap,  and only authorized  site personnel  have  access  to the 
code.  Limited individually  identifiable private information is collected  that is essential  for 
processing participant  payments and for analysis  purposes.  
10.5.2  Confidentiality  of the App 
The App requires a password.  All study  data will be encrypted and stored  on secure  
HIPAA - compliant  servers at  the CUIMC  campus.  All study  data will be kept in  password - 
protected computers  or file cabinets in locked  offices and will be maintained in a completely  
secure  and HIPAA -compliant  environment.  All CUIMC  servers have  HIPAA -compliant  
security.  Nonetheless,  there is always the risk of  a data breach,  so we will  make  our study  
participants  aware of  this risk upon enrollment.  
10.5.3  Confidentiality  and privacy  of the study  data 
All study  data will be stored in password -protected  computers or  file cabinets in locked  offices.  
Audio recordings of  interviews  or focus  groups  will be destroyed once data  are transcribed  
and analyzed.  All research team  members will  pass the protection of  human  
subjects and HIPAA  research  exams  and sign a protocol -specific  conflict  of interest.  Risks will  
be minimized by not including personal  identifying information on  the forms,  when possible,  
and by conducting  interviews and collection  of personal  information in a private  setting.  All 
data will be collected  using  unique patient  identification codes.  All laboratory  specimens,  
evaluation  forms,  reports,  and other  records  will be identified  by a coded  number  to maintain  
participant  confidentiality.  All records  will be stored in a locked  file cabinet.  Study  data from 
both sites will  be collected and  managed  using  REDCap.  REDCap is  a secure web  application  
designed  to support  data capture  for research studies,  providing  user-friendly  web- based  
case  report  forms,  real-time data entry validation  (e.g.,  for data types and range  checks),   
audit  trails,  and a deidentified data  export  mechanism  to common  statistical  packages    
(SPSS,  SAS,  Stata,  R/S-Plus).  REDCap data collection projects  rely on a thorough  study -
specific data dictionary  defined in an iterative self -documenting  process  by all members  of the 
research  team.  This iterative  development  and testing process results in a well- planned  data 
collection strategy  for individual  studies.  REDCap  also includes  a powerful  tool for building 
and managing online  surveys.  The research  team  can create and design  surveys       in a web 
browser  and engage potential  respondents using  a variety  of notification  methods.  
REDCap is flexible  enough  to be used  for a variety of  types of  research and provides  an 
intuitive user  interface  for database and survey  design  and data entry.  Lastly,  clinical  
information will  not be released  without  written permission  of the participant,  except  as 
necessary  for monitoring by the IRB or the CDC.  
10.5.4  Plan  for privacy  and data security  
Beginning  with the development  process and  throughout  the research  project,  we will follow  
the privacy  and security  principles set  forth at healthhit.gov.  Our team  is familiar  with the 
importance of  the privacy and security  of personal  health information  to engender  individual  
trust in the use of health  IT applications.  We have  expertise and experience in this domain  as 
we have  developed  several  health  IT systems  funded  through NIH  and the Agency  for 
Healthcare Research and Quality  for persons living  with HIV whose personal  health  
information is usually  held to higher  security  standards  than traditional  patients as HIV  has 
historically  been  a stigmatized  disease.  We built the the mLab  App Plus  (NIMH  
25 
Protocol  Number:  AAAU1706  
Version  3.4 02.14.24  
26  
  
R01MH118151)  which is  housed on the CUIMC IT servers.  Study  data from mLab  App Plus 
will be stored on  the CUIMC  servers.  The CUIMC  servers  are in a secure datacenter,  with 
necessary  redundancies.  Currently  the network can be accessed  remotely  via Virtual  Private  
Network  with a Citrix  solution being developed.  All servers  have  HIPAA  compliant  security.  
 
CUIMC  has an  Information Security  Office  (ISO)  that facilitates  all aspects  of information  
security  risk management  at CUIMC,  with a particular  focus on threat  management  and 
HIPAA  compliance.  This includes administration and enforcement  of information  security  
policies on campus.  
 
The Information Security  Office also provides  guidance  to CUIMC  schools  and departments  
regarding any information security  concerns  they may have.  The ISO collaborates with  the 
entire CUIMC  community  to protect  the confidentiality,  integrity,  and availability  of critical  
information and computer  resources.  The ISO strives to implement  secure  computing  
infrastructure and practices with sensitivity  to CUIMC's educational  and research  
environment.  Columbia  University  has an information  security  charter  which is the foundation  
of all the work carried  out by Dr. Schnall  and her research  team.  In specific,  Dr. Schnall  will 
work with the CUIMC  IT server  group  and the information  security  office  to protect  the 
confidentiality,  integrity,  and availability  of participants’  data.  Confidentiality  means  that 
information is only accessible to authorized users.  Integrity  means  safeguarding the accuracy  
and completeness of  data and processing methods.  Availability  means  ensuring that  
authorized users,  such as research  participants,  have access to data and associated  
information  resources when  required.  
 
Prior to consent,  study  participants will  be informed as to what data the App will collect.  Data 
will be encrypted  and stored securely  on the CUIMC  IT servers.  As a starting  point  for 
ensuring privacy  and security,  all smartphones will  be password –protected.  In addition,  there  
will be an additional  password  for the App so that only study  participants  will be able  to open  
the App. 
 
 
10.6 Unexpected and Serious  Adverse  Event  Reporting  
 
A detailed  monitoring  plan will be included  as part of the study  protocol,  submitted  to the IRB, 
and reviewed and approved by the Centers  for Disease Control  and Prevention  (CDC)  before  
the study  begins.  Prior to initiation of  the study,  agreement  about  the data safety  monitoring  
plan will be confirmed  to ensure  the safety  of participants  and the validity  and integrity  of the 
data.  Study  staff at each  site will report  serious adverse events  (SAEs)  that are unexpected  
and study -related immediately  to the PI who will  convey  this information  to the study  team,  
IRB, and the CDC.  All AEs and SAEs will  be captured,  reports will  be completed,  and 
information will  be entered  into the study  database.  A safety  report  will detail  all serious and 
unexpected AEs  or other  unanticipated problems  that involve  risk to study  participants or  
others and whether  these appeared  to be related  to the study -based interventions  or research  
assessment  protocols.  All SAEs will  be reviewed every  6 months,  or sooner,  with 
the designated  safety  Data Safety  and Monitoring  Board.  
 
10.7 ClinicalTrials.gov  
 
This study will  be registered on ClinicalTrials.gov.

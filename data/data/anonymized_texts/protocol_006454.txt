3. INTRODUCTION
As per ICH E9 (1), the purpose of this document is to provide a more technical and detailed 
elaboration of the principal features of the anal ysis described in the protocol and its
amendments, and to includ e detailed procedures for executing the statistical analy sis of the 
primary  and secondary  variables and other data.
This Trial Statistical Analy sis Plan ( TSAP )assumes familiarity  with the Clinical Trial 
Protocol (CTP), including Protocol Amendments. In particular, the TSAP is based on the 
planned anal ysis specification as written in CTP Section 7 “Statistical Methods and 
Determination of Sample Size”. Therefore, TSAP readers may consult the CTP for more 
background information on the study , e.g., on study  objectives, study  design and population, 
treatments, definition of measurements and variables, planning of sample size, randomization.
SAS®Version 9.4will be used for all anal yses.

4. CHANGES IN THE PLANN ED ANALYSIS OF THE S TUDY
The clinical trial protocol (CTP) v3 was amended based on the feedback received from the 
FDA during a PPSR request. The MTD expansion cohort swill now recruit up to 38 patients 
evaluable for OR based on biomarker selection criteria as well as specific tumo
ur indications. 
The definition of duration of objective response was misspecified in the  CTP as the interval 
between the date of randomization and the earliest date of disease p rogression
. The correct 
definition is clarified in Section 5.2.2 of this TSAP as the time from first documented 
response of CR, VGPR, PR, or MxR until the earliest of disease progression or death among 
patients with objective r esponse .

5. ENDPOINT (S)
5.1 PRIMARY E NDPOINT (S)
Dose finding part:
The primary  endpoint is the dose limiting toxicity (DLT) measured during the first 
course of treatment . DLT sare defined in Table 4.1.4.1.2 of the CTP. 
Pharmacokinetics (AUC τ,ss, Cmax,ss)
Theprimary  objective of the dose finding part is to determine the maximum tolerated dose 
(MTD) of the stud y drug as defined b y patients with DL T in a pae diatric population. The 
MTD will be determined as the highest dose at which no more than 1/6 patients experienced 
DLT. The MTD evaluation period is defined as the initial 28 day s of study  treatment. Patients 
who developed DLT at any  time during the initial 28 treatment day s and patients who have 
completed the MTD evaluation period without missing more than 25% of the afatinib doses 
regardless of the reason will be referred to as patients evaluable for DLT.
MTD expansion cohort part:
Objective response (OR) byinvestigator assessment according to the institutional 
response evaluation criteria for the given tumo ur ty pe , assessed every 8 weeks until 
progression of disease.
5.2 SECONDARY ENDPOINT (S)
5.2.1 Key secondary endpoint(s)
There were no key  secondary  endpoints for this study .
5.2.2 Secondary endpoint (s)
Dose finding part:
Objective response (OR) assessed byinvestigator according to the institutional 
response evaluation criteria for the given tumo ur type, assessed every 8 weeks until 
progression of disease
Pharmacokinetics (AUC 0-24, Cmax, tmax(,ss)and accumulation (or effective) hal f-life)
MTD expansion cohort part:
Progression free survival (PFS) is defined as the duration of time from the date of 
first drug administration to the date of the first documented disease progression 
evaluated according to institutional response criteria or to the date of death from any  
cause, whichever occurs first. Censoring rules and dates of outcome for PFS under 
difference scenarios are specified in Table 5.2.2: 1 .
Duration of objective response (DoR) is defined as the time from first documented 
response of CR, VGPR, PR, or MxR until the earliest of disease progression or death 
among patients with objective response. Censoring rules and dates of outcomes follow 
the same specifications as for PFS in Table 5.2.2: 1 for applicable scenarios.
Pharmacokinetics (AUCτ(,ss), Cmax(,ss), tmax(,ss)and accumulation (or effective) hal f-life)

6. GENERAL ANALYSIS DEF INITIONS
6.1 TREATMENT (S)
Daily  single oral dosesof afatinib will be investigated in th isstudy for paediatric patients. 
Dose escalation starts at 80% of the adult MTD by  m2BSA and allometric scaling (Level 0) 
and can be escalated to 100% (level 1), 125% (level 2) and 150% (level 3) of the adult dose if 
required.  In case level 0 exceeds the MTD, a dose level - 1 will allow de -escalation to 50% of 
the a dult MTD dose b y m2BSA and allometric scaling. O ral solution is available for younger 
childre n and patients who cannot swallow afatinib film coated tablets . 
Analy sing treatment period saredefined in Table 6.1: 1 for reporting of treatment emergent 
AEs a nd safety  laboratory  data . An adverse event will be assigned to the analy sing period 
where start date ≤ onset date of AE < stop date.

or date of death + 1 day  whichever 
occurred first
The residual effect period (REP) for afatinib is 28 day s after last intake of afatinib. Data 
recorded between the first study  drug intake until up to 28 day s after the last study  drug intake 
will be considered as on -treatment.
6.2 IMPORTANT PROTOCOL DEVIATIONS
A protocol deviation is important if it affects the rights or safet y of the study patients, or if it 
can potentiall y influence the primary  outcome measurements in a non -negligib le way . 
Patients with important protocol deviation s(IPDs) that could potentially  impact the 
evaluation of the primary endpoint(s) will be excluded.

The different categories of IPDsare defined in Table 6.2: 1 . IPDswill be reviewed at Medical 
Quality  Review Meetings (MQRMs) conducted periodicall y during the trial. A list of protocol 
deviations will be discussed at the report planning meetings (RPMs). If the data show other 
IPDs , this table will be supplemented accor dingl y at MQRMs or RPMs or through team 
review of the protocol deviation log. The decision whether a patient will be excluded from the 
analysis will be made at the final RPM prior to DBL.

6.3 P ATIENT SETS ANALYSED
Treated set (TS): 
This patient set includes all patients enrolled in the trial who were documented to have taken 
at least one dose of stud y medication. 
Dose finding cohort treated set:
This patient set includes all patients enrolled in dose finding cohort of the trial who were 
documented to have taken at least one dose of study  medication .

TSAP for BI Trial No: 1200.120 Page 16of 27
Proprietary confidential information © 2020 Boehringer Ingelheim International GmbH or one or more of its affiliated companies
MTD Expansion cohort treated set:
This patient set includes all patients enro lled in expansion cohort who must satisfy  the 
following criterion: 
Patients’ tumour must be tested for positi vity on 2 of the following tests: EGFR 
IHC>150 and/or HER2 IHC>0 and/or EGFR FISH positive and/or HER2 DDI SH 
positive .
or
Patient will have proven genomic, transcriptomic or proteomic alterations which are 
not defined above .
and
Patients who were documented to have taken at least one dose of study  medication.
PKanaly sis set (PKS) :
This set includes all patients in the treated set (TS) who provided at least one PK endpoint 
that was not excluded due to a protocol deviation relevant to the evaluation of PK or due to 
PK non- evaluability . Thus, a patient will be included in the PKS, even if he/she contributes 
only one PK parameter value for one period to the statistical assessment. Descriptive and 
model based anal yses of PK parameters will be based on the PKS.
6.5 POOLING OF CENTRES
This section is not applicable.
6.6 HANDLING OF MISSING DATA AND OUTLIERS
Missing or incomplete AE dates are imputed according to BI standards (3).Missing efficacy  
data, including vital status, tumo ur imaging data, will not be imputed in general. All 
reasonable efforts have been undertaken during the study  to obtain such data.
Missing or incomplete drug stop dates are imputed as follows: 
If month and year known for drug stop date but day missing, then use date of death if 
within the month; otherwise use last day  of month.
If both month and day  unknown, then use the first available date in this order: date of 
death, date of last contact, last day  of the month of last visit.
Missing data and outliers of PK data are handled according to (2). Samples marked as no 
sample available (NOS) or non- valid result (NOR) will not be included in the anal ysis. Please 
refer to Sections 7.3.5 and 7.4 of the CTP for more details.

6.7 BASELINE, TIME WINDO WS AND CALCULATED VI SITS
Study  days and visits will be labelled according to the flow chart of the CTP.
Unless otherwise specified, baseline is defined as the latest time point before the very  first 
administration of any  study medication. If this criterion is not fulfilled, then no baseline will 
be derived. Note that for some trial procedures (for example performance score, bod y weight, 
vital signs, laboratory  tests) this may  be the value measured on the same day  when trial 
medication was started. In these cases it will be assumed that the measurements were taken 
prior to the intake of an y study  medication. For laboratory  values where not only  the 
examination date but also time are recorded, examination time has to be taken into account 
when defining baseline. That is, a laboratory  value on the same date as the first study  drug 
administration is considered as baseline value if and only  if the time of laboratory  value is 
before or the same as the time of first study  drug administration. If any of these times are 
missing and the date of laboratory  value is equal to the date of first study  drug administration, 
then the laboratory  assessment will be considered as according to protocol, i.e. as prior to first 
study  medication.

7. PLANNED ANALYSIS
For End -Of-Text ( EoT) tables, the set of summary statistics is: N / Mean / SD / Min / Q1 
(lower quartile) / Median / Q3 (upper quartile) / Max.
Tabulations of frequencies for categorical data will include all possible categories and will 
display  the number of observations in a category  as well as the percentage (%) relative to the 
respective treatment group (unless otherwise specified, all patients in the respective patient set 
whether they  have non- missing values or not). Percentages will be rounded to one decimal 
place. The category  missing will be display ed onl y if there are actuall y missing values.
7.1 DEMOGRAPHIC AND OTHE R BA SELINE CHARACTERISTI CS
Only  descriptive statistics are planned for this section of the report.
7.2 CONCOMITANT DISEASES AND MEDICATION
Only  descriptive statistics are planned for this section of the report.
7.3 TREATMENT COMPLIANCE
Only  descriptive statistics are planned for this section of the report.
7.4 PRIMARY ENDPOINT (S)
7.4.1 Dose Finding Part :
One of t he primary  objectives is to assess the MTD based on the number of patients 
presenting DLTs during t he MTD evaluation period. Therefore, an overall summary  of DLTs 
(see CTP 
Section 4, T able 4.1.4.1.2 for the definition of DLTs) which occurred during the 
MTD evaluation period will be provided for each dose cohort from the dose finding cohort 
treated set. Patients who were replaced within the MTD evaluation period will be excluded 
from the determination of the MTD but will be considered for all other safety  evaluations.
A summary  of the number of patients with DLTs overall in any  course will be also given b y 
initial treatment and di splay ed in a similar format to the summary  of DLTs occurring in the 
MTD evaluation period.
The determination of the MTD is based on a Rolling 6 design as illustrated in Section 4, Table 
4.1.4.1:1 of the CTP . The MTD is defined as the highest dose at which no more than 1/6 
patients experienced DLT considered related to afatinib during the MTD evaluation period. 
Refer to CTP 7.3.1 for further details on MTD evaluation. 
Analysis of the standard PK endpoints is performed according to ( 2)and ( 8) as outlined in 
Section 7.3.5 of the CTP .
7.4.2 MTD expansion cohort part:
Objective response (OR) is defined as abest overall response of complete response (CR) or  
partial response (PR) based on investigator’s assessment according to the institutional 
Boehringer Ingelheim
TSAP for BI Trial No: 1200.120 Page 19of 27
Proprietary confidential information © 2020 Boehringer Ingelheim International GmbH or one or more of its affiliated companies
response evaluation criteria for the given tumour type. If the International Criteria for 
Neuroblastoma Response Criteria (INRC) is used, OR is defined as complete resp onse (CR), 
very good partial response (VGPR), partial response (PR) and mixed response (MxR). For 
further details on OR, please refer to CTP Section 7.3.1. The objective response rate will be 
calculated and reported as proportion of responders with 95% Clo pper-Pearson C Is based on 
all treated patients. Objective response will be summarized regardless of confirmation.  
Additional summary  or listing may  be provided for confirmed response. If only  few patients 
(fewer than 5) achieved objective response, a detailed listing will be reported. 
For objective responses, evaluated b y institutional response evaluation criteria other than 
INRC ,below confirmation rule for best overall response will be considered. 
If CR or PR : look at all 
subsequent visits, if there is another CR or PR >=28 days then 
the patient has a confirmed response. If there is not another CR or PR >=28 day s then 
the patient can be SD. Please note that once patient achieve CR any  response other 
than CR wi ll be considered as PD. 
Detailed specifications are listed in Table 7.4.2: 1.

only be a PR if initial CR is changed to PR (i.e. not a true CR).
For INRC, a similar derivation of confirmed response will apply. That is, a subsequent 
assessment with the same or a better overall response on or after 28 day s is required for the 
confirmation of an objective response, in the order from best to worst of  CR > VGPR > PR >
MxR. Otherwise, a SD will be considered as the confirmed best overall response.

7.5.2 (Other) Secondary endpoint (s)
For progression free survival (PFS) ,objective response (OR) and duration of objective 
response (DoR) , a descriptive and graphical summary  of the endpoint will be provided. The 
Kaplan -Meier estimates of PFS and DoR (if applicable) and 95% confidence intervals will be 
calculated at the time of each planned assessment. For the dose finding part, the number of 
patients with OR will be summarized by  dose level. If few erthan 5 patients achieved OR, 
then DoR will only  be listed ;Kaplan -Meier estimates will not be calculated and no summary
table or graph will be provided. 
To evaluate the potential influence of age on pharmacokinetic parameters like C maxand AUC, 
an exploratory  subgroup anal ysis will be performed for different age groups. For this ,binning 
of age into groups will be performed to ensure that groups have reaso nable patient numbers. If 
feasible, a correlation of age and PK parameters may be performed. 
7.7 EXTENT OF EXPOSURE
Treatment exposure will be primaril y summarized by the total on -treatment time and has been 
defined in Section 5.4 of this TSAP . 
Treatment interruptions before permanent discontinuation will not be excluded. Summary  
statistics for treatment time by  each dose level of afatinib over time will also be provided.

7.8 SAFETY ANALYSIS
All safet y anal yses will b e performed on the tr eated set.
7.8.1 Adverse events
The anal yses of adverse events (AE) will be descriptive in nature. All analy ses of AEs will be 
based on the number of patients with AEs and not on the number of AEs. For anal ysis of 
duration, severit y etc. of multiple AE occurrence s,data on the case report form ( CRF ) will be 
collapsed into AE episodes provided that all of the following applies:
The same MedDRA lowest level term was reported for the occurrences.
The occurrences were time -overlapping or time -adjacent (time -adjacency  of two 
occurrences is given if the second occurrence started on the same day  or on the day  
after the end of the first occurrence).
Treatment did not change between the onset of the occurrences or treatment changed 
between the onsets of the occurrences, but no deterioration was observed for the later 
occurrence.
For further details on summarization of AE data, please refer to the BI guideline ( 4).
The anal yses of adverse events will be based on the concept of tr eatment -emergent adverse 
events . That means that all adverse events occurring between first drug intake and 28 days 
after last drug intake or death, whichever occurs first, will be assigned to the on -treatment 
period. All adverse events occurring before an y study drug intake will be assigned to 
‘screening’ and all adverse events occurring after last study  drug intake + 28days will be 
assigned to ‘ Off-treatment ’ (for listings onl y). For details on the treatment definition, see 
Section 6.1.
An overall summary  of adverse events will be presented. The frequency  of patients with 
adverse events will be summarised by  highest CTC grade (grades 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and all grades), 
treatment, primary  system organ class and preferred term for each of t he following AE tables
as well as relatedness of AEs to treatment and seriousness :
DLTs (1stcourse and all courses)
All AEs
Drug -related AEs
AEs leading to dose reduction
AEs leading to treatment discontinuation
Drug -related AEs leading to dose reduction
Drug -related AEs leading to treatment discontinuation
AEs leading to death
Serious AEs
Drug related serious AEs
Other significant AEs, defined as AEs leading to dose reduction or permanent 
discontinuation of study  medication
Non-serious AEs with higher than 5% occurrence rate for disclosure on 
ClinicalTrials.gov

Please refer to CTP Section 5.2.2.1 for definitions of the adverse events . All tables will be 
sorted by  system organ classes (SOC) according to the standard sort order specified by  the 
European M edicines Agency  (EMA). Preferred terms (PTs) will be sorted by frequency  
(within SOC).
The table for all AEs will be repeated with the project defined grouping of AE terms ( acute 
renal failure associated with severe diarrhoea, acne, rash, stomatitis, conjunctivitis , 
paron ychia, severe cutaneous adverse reactions , interstitial lung disease, keratitis, hepatic 
impairment, pancreatitis, heart failure, gastrointestinal perforation, hy persensitivity  reactions, 
nail 
disorders and fatigue). Details of the project defined groupings will be defined in the 
technical TSAP. In these tables the grouped AEs will replace the original PTs for all AEs that 
are included within the grouped term. The grouped AE categories will then be tabulated along 
with all remaining MedDRA PTs, sorted by  descending frequency .
A reference table presenting the entire project defined groupings and MedDRA PTs within 
each grouping will also be produced.
Additional AE tables will be produced for AEs of special interest ( hepatic injury  as defined in 
CTP Section 5.2.2.1 and dose limiting toxicities as defined b y CTP Section 4, table 4 .1.4.2). 
Listing sproviding further details on highest CTC grade, action taken w ith study  drug and 
time to first onset of AE will be produced
.
7.8.2 Laboratory data
The anal yses of laboratory  data will be descriptive in nature and will be based on BI standards
(5). The same on -treatment period as considered for the anal ysis of AEs will be applied for 
laboratory  values. CTC grade for applicable lab parameters will be calculated according to 
CTCAE v3.0 ( 7).
For a list of laboratory  parameters considered for this trial, please refer to CTP Section 5.2.3, 
Table 5.2.3:1. Descriptive statistics of all normalized laboratory  values b y visit will be 
provided including changes from baseline . Transition tables of CTCAE grade from baseline to 
worst value and last value on treatment , and frequency  tables of possible clinically  significant 
abnormalities will be produced. For those parameters that have CTC grading possible 
clinically  significant abnormalities are defined as those laboratory  values with a CTC grade ≥ 
2 that have had an increase of ≥ 1 grade from baseline. For those parameters for which no 
CTC grade has been defined standard BI project definitions will be used to decide on clinical 
significance. See Tables 7.8.2: 1 and 7.8.2: 2 for the potential clinical significance rules.
Analy ses of descriptive statistics willuse normalized lab values (variables ULN , LABN ).
Analy ses of frequencies of patients with potential clinical significance, analy ses of shift, and
liver function categories tables willuse converted values ( ULC , LABSTD ).
Summaries will be produced of laboratory  data recorded on -treatment .Listings will be 
provided for data recorded prior to treatment, on -treatment and post- treatment. For details on 
the treatment definition, see Section 6.1 .
For the primary  laboratory  parameters listed in Table 7.8.2: 1, f ull analy sis of descriptive 
statistics, transition tables and possible clinical significant abnormalities will be conducted.

Blood Loss and Visibility with Esmolol vs. Labetalol in Endoscopic Sinus Surgery: A 
Randomized Trial  
Date: 09/04/2018  
 
  
Study Summary and Aims  
 
The purpose of this study is to compare esmolol and labetalol bleeding  and visibility outcomes in 
FESS surgery. It is a double -blinded two -arme d trial with no placebo control, conducted at a 
tertiary center. Participants include adults with history of CRS with or without nasal polyps, 
undergoing FESS for CRS. 38 patients wer e enrolled, with 32 receiving study drug (17 esmolol, 
15 labetalol). Total study duration , including recruitment and analysis , was 1 year with no 
follow -up. Treatments involve giving intraoperative 20mg of Labetol (max dose = 300 mg for 
total operation) or infusing 0.1mg/kg/min esmolol (max dose after 30 minutes = 0.3mg/kg/min) 
when MAP rises above 80 mmHg. The primary aim is to evaluate the relative efficacy of these 
drugs in FESS surgery , specifica lly controlling bleeding and improving visibility.  
 
Study Endpoints  
 
March 2017 – March 2018 enrollment, drug administration only during surgery.  
 
Sample Size Considerations  
 
Futility analysis  based on  estimated blood loss data to see how many patients would be required 
to show significant differences in blood loss, and therefore mucosal visibility, between drug 
groups. Given the small differences in blood loss per minute during surgery between treatmen t 
groups (0.63 compared to 0.67), and given the relatively large standard deviations obtained (0.33 
and 0.3 7), 1,245 patients would be required in each drug group (total N = 2,490), using a non -
paired (two-sided) t-test for the comparison, to show a statis tically significant difference between 
the 2 treatments with a power of 0.8 and type I error of 0.05.   
 
These sample size calculations are based on the primary aims of determining a significant 
difference in FESS visibility between the two drugs.  
 
The null hypothesis is that there will be no statistical difference between esmolol and labetalol in 
FESS visibility and bleeding parameters. The alternative hypothesis is that there will be a 
significant difference, in either drug, for improved FESS visib ility and bleeding parameters.  
 
The minimum difference that we judge to be statistically significant is a 1 -point change on the 
visibility scores (Boezaart 5 -point, Wormald 10 -point).

Statistical Analysis and Description of Main Tabl es 
 
All data for the study outcomes was analyzed with the Wilcoxon rank sum test, used to compare 
the confidence interval location shift differences between groups. P -value was based on 
asymptotic Wilcoxon two -sample test with continuity correction of 0.5.  The 95% confidence 
interval for the location shift was based on Hodges -Lehmann estimation. Categorical data 
(gender) analyzed with chi -square test. Results were analyzed using the statistical program IBM© 
SPSS© Statistics (Version 24). P -value < 0.05 was considered significant.

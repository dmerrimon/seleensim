prophylaxis.  
All subjects in Arm 4 will undergo a n rIX-FP (50 IU/kg) PK evaluation 
at Day 1 as the first dose if feasible or during the study after at least 7 
days washout from the previous rIX -FP dose, when the subject is in 
non-bleeding state.  
Up until the month 6 visit, subjects in Arm 1-3 will administer rIX -FP 
routine prophylaxis with the following treatment intervals:  
Arm 1: rIX-FP administered once every 7, 10, or 14 days.  
Arm 2: rIX-FP administered once every 7 days (subjects from study 
CSL654_3001 Arm 2 with less than 26 -weeks experience with 
weekly prophylaxis).  
rIX-FP administered once every 14 days (subjects from study 
CSL654_3001 Arm 2 with at least 26 -weeks experience with 
weekly prophylaxis).    
Arm 3 (No subjects in France may enroll in Arm 3) : rIX-FP 
administered once ev ery 7 days  until the month 6 visit. 
 
After the month 6 visit, all subjects (Arms 1, 2, and 3) will administer 
rIX-FP once every 7, 10, or 14 days for approximately  30 months.  
Subjects ≥ 18 years of age (except subjects from France, regardless the 
age) also have the option to administer rIX -FP once every 21 days. 
Any subject transferring to a 21 -day treatment interval for the first 
time must have completed at least 6  months of prophylaxis treatment 
with a 14-day treatment interval and have undergone a PK  evaluation 
with a single rIX -FP injection of 100 IU/kg. 
At the end of the study, subjects from the lead -in studies are expected 
to have accumulated at least 100 rIX -FP exposure days (EDs) during 
their enrollment in all CSL -sponsored rIX -FP studies . 
Arm 4: 
Subjects in Arm 4 will administer rIX-FP as weekly  prophylaxis and / 
or on-demand, prevention during the first 12 months, and then on 
weekly routine prophylaxis until completing 50  EDs.  Subjects who 
complete 50 EDs are permitted to continue weekly routine prophylaxis 
with rIX-FP until the completion of the study .

CRD-TPL-077 Version 1.0  Confidential  Surgical Prophylaxis Substudy  
All subjects in Arm 3  (No subjects in France may enroll in Arm 3)  
should start the surgery substudy within  approximately  8 weeks from 
receiving the first rIX -FP injection (ie,  during the PK evaluation 
period).  If a subject in either Arms 1 or 2 requires a major or minor 
surgical non -emergency procedure during the study,  or if a subject in 
Arm 4 requires a minor surgical procedure during the study,  the subject 
may also be enrolled in the surgery substudy.   
Approximately 3 hours before the surgical procedure, the subject will 
receive a single bolus injection of rIX -FP in order to increase the plasma 
FIX activity level to 60% to 80% , or higher .  At the investigator’ s 
discretion, a dditional bolus injections of rIX -FP may be administered 
during surgery or during the postoperative period, defined as the start 
of wound closure, to maintain a required trough FIX activity level.  
Subcutaneous (SC) Substudy  
Subjects enrolled in this substudy will be sequentially assigned to a 
cohort (Cohort 1 [ single dose of 25 IU/kg], Cohort 2 [single dose of 50 
IU/kg], Cohort 3 [ 15 doses of 25 IU/kg every 3  days], and an optional 
Cohort 4 [ 15 doses of ≤ 50 IU/kg every 5 days , with the actual dose in 
this cohort to be determined by CSL based  on the PK results from 
Cohort 3).  In all cohorts, rIX-FP will be administered SC at least 
14 days after the previous intravenous ( IV) rIX-FP administration .  
In Cohorts 1 and 2, b lood samples for PK analysis will be collected at 
selected time  points through Day 15 (336 hours).  Following collection 
of the last SC PK sample at the 336 hour time point on Day 15 , a single 
IV dose of 50 IU/kg rIX-FP will be administered  and blood samples for 
PK analysis will be collected at selected time  points. Subjects will return 
in 2 weeks (Day 28) for an end of substudy visit to assess safety.  After 
the end of substudy visit on Day 28, Cohort 1 and 2 subjects will return 
to their IV rI X-FP prophylaxis regimen in the main study.   
In Cohorts 3 and 4, blood samples for PK analysis will be collected at 
before the first SC dose , before selected SC doses, as well as  for a serial 
PK profile af ter the first and the final SC doses. Subjects will return 2 
weeks after their last SC dose for an end of substudy  visit for collection 
of the final SC PK sample and for safety assessments . After the end of 
substudy visit, Cohort 3 and 4 subjects will return to their IV rIX -FP 
prophylaxis regimen in  the main study.

During the study, subjects may administer rIX -FP as a preventative 
treatment before vigorous physical activity or before physical therapy 
(ie, as a part of rehabilitation after major surgery) that, in the subject’s 
experience, is likely to result in bleeding.   
Preventative treatment before vigorous physical activity should not be 
used more frequently than once per month . 
Preventative treatment b efore physical therapy (ie, after major surgery) 
should not be used more frequently than once per week  during the first 
3 months of either starting the prophylaxis treatment period (subjects in 
Arm 3, which excludes subjects in France ) or returning to rout ine 
prophylaxis (subjects in Arms 1 or 2).  
The dose of rIX -FP will be 35 to 50 IU/kg, as determined by the 
investigator and / or based on the subject’s previous experience.   
Subcutaneous Treatment  in the Subcutaneous Substudy  
Subjects will be sequentially  assigned to a cohort, and receive a single 
SC dose of rIX-FP (in Cohorts 1 and 2) or repeated SC doses of rIX-FP 
(in Cohorts 3 and 4).  The SC dose s of rIX-FP will be administered at 
up to 4 injection sites, a minimum of 2.5 cm apart, with a volume of up 
to 4 mL per site.  Subcutaneous administration may occur on the

administered at least 14 days after the previous IV rIX-FP 
administration (21 days if subject is on  a 21-day prophylaxis regimen  
in the main study ).  In Cohorts 1 and 2,  subjects will be administered a 
single IV dose of 50  IU/kg rIX -FP at Day 15 (336 hours). After the end  
of substudy visit , Cohort 3 and 4 subjects will return to their IV rIX -FP 
prophylaxis regimen in the main study.  
Comparator  Product,  
Dose, Dosing Regimen 
and Administration  Not applicable.  
Efficacy Assessments  The efficacy of rIX -FP treatment in the prevention and treatment of 
bleeding episodes will be assessed based on the following:  
 Total consumption of rIX -FP (number of EDs and mean IU/kg per 
year per subject and per bleeding episode) and consumption per 
routine prophylaxis, prevention before physical activity, and 
on-demand treatment.  
 Number of spontaneous and total bleeding episodes and 
corresponding ABRs per treatment interval . 
 Investigator’s overall clinical assessment of  hemostatic  efficacy 
for treatment of major bleeding episodes.  
 Number of rIX -FP injections required to achieve hem ostasis. 
Safety Assessments  Safety will be assessed based on the following variables:  
 Adverse events  and serious adverse events . 
 Local tolerability.  
 Serum biochemistry and hematology.  
 Physical examination and v ital signs.  
 Inhibitors against FIX . 
 Antibodie s against rIX -FP and Chinese hamster ovary cell-derived 
proteins. 
Pharmacokinetics  Subjects beginning routine prophylaxis treatment using a treatment 
interval of 21 days for the first time (age ≥ 18 years , excludes subjects 
in France) and subjects in Arm  3 (also excluded in France)  will undergo 
a PK evaluation with a single injection of rIX -FP (100 IU/kg).  Subjects 
in Arm 4 may also undergo a PK evaluation  at the beginning of the study  
with a single injection of rIX -FP (50 IU/kg). For this PK evaluation, 
blood samples will be taken for the measurement of the FIX activity 
level and incremental recovery.

CRD-TPL-077 Version 1.0  Confidential  In addition,  PK evaluation of 50, 75, or 100  IU/kg rIX -FP may also be 
assessed at the investigator’s discretion or CSL’s request, in the event 
of (but not l imited to) , poor efficacy, suspicion of inhibitor 
development, or before major surgery.  Subjects in France may be 
discontinued from receiving the study product and participating in any 
further study procedures if the subject is confirmed  to have developed 
an inhibitor against FIX with a titer > 5 Bethesda units (BU)/mL. 
The trough FIX activity level will be assessed after each major bleeding 
episode (if feasible) and at specified visits . 
See Appendix 2  for PK as sessments in the SC substudy. 
Pharmacodynamics  Not applicable.  
Other Assessments  Other assessments to be made during the study include:  
 A hemophilia -specific treatment satisfaction 
questionnaire  (Hemo-Sat; CSL654_3002 lead -in study only). 
  
 Social and physical activity  assessment.  
Statistical Analyses  All safety and efficacy data will be summarized  using descriptive 
statistics for continuous data, or frequencies and percentages  for 
categorical data .  
Efficacy Analyses  
AsBRs and ABRs will be derived for each treatment interval  assigned 
to the subject  while on routine prophylaxis  (7-day, 10-day, 14-day, and 
21-day), and will not include t he time either during or the first 3 months 
after the surgery substudy , the time during the SC substudy,  and 
subjects in Arm 4 .  
AsBRs and ABRs  will be summarized across subjects using descriptive 
statistics. A crude rate will also be calculated for each treatment interval  
along with an exact two -sided 95% confidence interval assuming  a 
Poisson-distributed event rate . 
A comparison of A sBRs and ABRs  will be performed between 14 -day 
routine prophylaxis treatment in this study compared with on -demand 
only treatment from Study CSL654_3001  Arm 2.  A further analysis 
will be conducted with the  subjects from lead-in Study CSL654_3001 
to assess whether the 14-day prophylaxis regimen is non -inferior to the 
7-day prophylaxis regimen from Study CSL654_3001 (plus data

AsBR and ABR . The non-inferority analysis will also be conducted for 
extended regimens (either 14 -day or 10 -day regimen) and the 7-day 
prophylaxis regimen.   Non-inferiority will be evaluated by comparing 
the lower bound of a 95% confidence  interval for a mean difference   
with a pre -established margin.   
Consumption of rIX -FP will be summarized with descriptive statistics 
according to treatment interval  and overall.   
For subjects fro m Study CSL654_3002, responses to the treatment 
satisfaction questionnaire and age group -specific  questionnaire 
(Hemo-Sat and , respectively ) will be summarized with 
descriptive statistics.  
Data from the surgery substudy will be summarized as case narratives  
or with descriptive statistics or counts , where appropriate . 
Safety Analyses  
The number and proportion of subjects with positive tests for inhibitors 
to FIX during the study will be tabulated  separately for PTPs (Arm 1, 2 
and 3) and PUPs (Arm 4).  Inhibitor antibodies against FIX will be 
categorized as low titer (≥ 0.6 to 5 BU/mL) and high titer (>  5 BU/mL).  
An exact 95% binomial confidence interval for inhibitor development 
among subjects treated with rIX -FP will be presented.  
The numbe r and proportion of subjects with adverse events and serious 
adverse events , which are study -emergent, will be tabulated.  
Laboratory, vital signs and physical examination assessments will be 
summarized.  
Pharmacokinetic Analyses  
Incremental recovery and FI X activity levels will be summarized using 
descriptive statistics.

CRD-TPL-077 Confidential  1.INTRODUCTION
1.1BACKGROUND  
Hemophilia B is an X -linked recessive inherited bleeding disorder resulting from a deficiency 
of coagulation factor IX (FIX), a coagulation factor central to the process of blood 
coagulation  [Giangrande, 2005 ].  Signs and symptoms of  hemophilia  B are variable, depending 
on the severity of FIX deficiency and the location of bleeding .  Most often, bleeding is 
characterized by spontaneous  or trauma -induced hemorrhage  into joints, muscles, and soft 
tissues.  Recurrent bleeding in the same location may lead to permanent injury of the joint .  
Rare but life -threatening bleeding may also occur in the central nervous system, throat , or 
gastrointestinal tract.  
The goal of therapy for hemophilia B is to treat or prevent hemorrhage, thereby reducing 
disabling joint and tissue damage, and improving .  Replacement therapy 
with FIX provides a temporary correction of the factor deficiency and reduces  bleeding 
tendencies .  Currently, plasma -derived and recombinant FIX products are used for the 
prophylactic and on -demand treatment of hemophilia B .  However, plasma -derived products 
are associated with risks related to transmission of infectious viruses  such as human 
immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis B virus , and hepatitis C virus .  Both plasma -derived and 
recombinant FIX products have a short half -life and, therefore, require dosing 2 to  3 times a 
week in order to achieve a significant reduction of bleedi ng episodes .  In addition, repeat dosing 
may be required to control bleeding episodes with a relatively short bleeding -free period 
following administration .  The need for frequent intravenous (IV) injections of either  plasma-
derived or recombinant F IX products carries significant burden for patients and the physicians 
treating their disorder .  Such a regimen in younger children often (but not always), requires the 
insertion of a venous access device that must be kept extremely clean to avoid infectious 
complications and prevent the development of clots in the line .  The risk and morbidity 
associated with such devices may prevent some very young children with hemophilia from 
receiving adequate care.

1.2BACKGROUND INFORMATI ON ON RECOMBINANT FUSION P ROTEIN 
LINKING COAGULATION FACTOR IX WITH ALBUM IN (rIX-FP) 
1.2.1 Overview 
Recombinant fusion protein linking coagulation factor IX with albumin (rIX -FP) is a purified 
recombinant protein, generated by the genetic fusion of recombinant human albumin to the 
c-terminus of r ecombinant F IX, with a cleavable linker .  The protein comprises 1018 am ino
acids in a single chain glycopeptide with a molecular weight of approximately 125 kDa .
Albumin is an abundant natural carrier molecule that is not involved in immune defense and
does not act as an adjuvant for the immune system.
rIX-FP is produced in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells , which have been characterized and 
shown to be free of known infectious agents .  rIX-FP is not derived from human blood and 
contains no preservatives or added animal or human components .  In addition, 3 (2 dedicated)  
virus inactivation  / reduction steps are applied in the manufacturing  process (see the 
Investigator’s Brochure  for further details) . 
This phase 3b study of rIX-FP is intended to evaluate long-term data on the safety and efficacy 
of rIX-FP for routine prophylaxi s and on-demand treatment of bleeding episodes in children 
and adults with severe hemophilia B (ie, FIX activity of ≤  2%). 
1.2.2 Nonclinical Evaluation  
Nonclinical studies of rIX -FP have demonstrated an acceptable safety profile, favorable 
pharmacokinetic (PK) properties and hemostatic efficacy.  
Single and repeat dose nonclinical rIX -FP safety studies have been conducted in rats  and 
cynomolgus monkeys .  In both species, the IV administration of rIX -FP, either as a single 
Study Number:  CSL654_3003  
Study Product:  rIX-FP 
Amendment 6  03 February  2020 Page 39 of 187 
CRD-TPL-077 Confidential  injection (500 IU/kg) or as a daily injection (up to 500 IU/kg/day) over 28 consecutive days, 
was well tolerated with no toxicologically  significant  changes [rats: studies APQ0005 , 
8244656, and APQ0009 and cynomolgus monkeys: studies APQ0002  and APQ0001 ].  In both 
species, the no observed adverse effect level for repeat doses of rIX -FP was 500 IU/kg  [studies 
APQ0009  and APQ0001 ], representing at least a 5 -fold safety margin over the proposed 
standard clinical dose of rIX -FP.  Repeat dosing was associated with the development of 
antihuman FIX antibodies (rats and cynomolgus monkeys) and an tihuman albumin antibodies 
(rats and 1 cynomolgus monkey) .   
Studies investigating local tolerance [Study APQ0008] and the thrombogenic 
potential [Study S22456] of rIX-FP have been conducted in rabbits .  There was n o local 
irritation, or treatment -related macroscopic or microscopic pathology findings, irrespective of 
the route of administration of rIX -FP (ie, IV, intra-arterial and perivenous injection) .  In 
addition, there was no thrombogenic activity observed in a rabbit venous stasis model (Wessler 
test) at any of the rIX -FP doses tested (75, 150 , and 500 IU/kg).   
Nonclinical studies have shown that rIX -FP has favorable PK properties, which might allow 
the reductio n of dosing frequency in patients with h emophilia B .   In a PK study in cynomolgus 
monkeys, rIX -FP was administered  as a single  IV injection  at doses of 50 or 100 IU/kg body 
weight [Study APQ0002 ].  The PK properties of rIX-FP were linear (ie, dose independent) 
over the dose range tested and were independent of sex .  The mean terminal half -life (t1/2) was 
42.2 hours, which is more than 3 times greater than published data for a recombinant human 
FIX product (t 1/2 = ~12.7 h) [McCarthy et al., 2002].   Studies in rats, rabbits, and FIX-deficient 
mice have also demonstrated that rIX -FP has improved PK parameters (ie, increased recovery, 
terminal half -life and area under the concentration -time curve [AUC] ) compared with  
published results of  a currently marketed recombinant FIX product [Metzner at al ., 2009].   
The pharmacodynamic activity of rIX -FP has been studied in 2 animal models deficient in FIX 
(dogs and mic e).  In the dog model, administration of rIX -FP (100 IU/kg IV) was associated

Study Product:  rIX-FP 
Amendment 6  03 February  2020 Page 40 of 187 
CRD-TPL-077 Confidential  with a shortening of the activated partial thromboplastin time and whole blood clotting time  
[Study 040200011 ].  In FIX deficient mice, the IV administration of rIX-FP (50, 100 , and 200 
IU/kg) was associated with a significant dose -dependent reduction of total blood loss, time to 
hemostasis and activated partial thromboplastin time  compared with the control (isotonic 
saline) [Study NBM 04/09 ].   
Further details on the outcomes of nonclinical studies are available in the 
Investigator’s  Brochure for rIX-FP. 
1.2.3 Previous Clinical Experience  
1.2.3.1  Study CSL654 _2001: phase 1, open -label, multicenter, dose -escalation, sa fety and 
pharmacokinetic study  
The primary study objective of Study CSL654_2001 was to assess the safety of the IV 
administration of rIX -FP in previously treated subjects with hemophilia B  
[Study CSL654_2001 ].  Subjects (age: 15 to 58 years) were administered a single injection of 
rIX-FP at a dose of either 25  IU/kg (9 subjects), 50 IU/kg (14 subjects), or 75 IU/kg 
(9 subjects).  rIX-FP was well tolerated for the duration of the study .  Of the 25 unique study 
subjects, 3 subjects reported a total of 4 adverse events (AEs) that were possibly related to rIX -
FP treatment .  Two of these AEs (1 subject: a mild headache and feeling hot 50 minutes after 
injection) resolved in 5 to 10 minutes without treatment .  The other 2 AEs (1  subject: mild 
constipation; 1 subject: erythema at injection site), resolved within the same day without 
treatment .  None of the subjects, including 7 subjects exposed to 2 doses of rIX -FP, had 
developed inhibitors to FIX , or antibodies to rIX -FP or album in 4 weeks after the first injection 
of rIX-FP.   
The study also investigated the PK profile of rIX -FP in 22 subjects .  At an rIX-FP dose of 
50 IU/kg (n = 13), the mean baseline -adjusted incremental recovery  (IR) (0 to 30 minutes)  was 
higher for rIX-FP compared with  both recombinant FIX  (46% higher; n = 8) and 
plasma-derived FIX (25% higher; n = 4) .  rIX-FP also exhibited an approximately 5 -fold longer

fold larger mean baseline -adjusted AUC and 7-fold slower clearance  when compared with the 
subject’s previous FIX product .  In addition, rIX -FP maintained a baseline -corrected mean 
trough level of 7.4% and 2.5% at Day 7 and Day  14, respectively, after administration of  
25 IU/kg rIX -FP. 
1.2.3.2  Study CSL654 -2004: phase 1/2, open -label, multicenter, pharmacokinetic, safety 
and efficacy study  
Study CSL654_2004 evaluated the safety, PK, and efficacy of rIX -FP for both prophylaxis and 
on-demand treatment of bleeding episodes in subj ects with hemophilia B .  A total of 17  male 
subjects were enrolled from hemophilia treatment centers in Israel and Bulgaria; the mean age 
was 26 years (range 13 to 46 years) .  The study design consisted of a n initial 10 to 14-day PK 
evaluation period, followed by an approximately 11-month safety and efficacy evaluation 
period of both prophylaxis and on -demand treatment of bleeding episodes with rIX -FP.  
Subjects could remain on study and receive rIX -FP treatment until th eir enrollment in the 
CSL654_3001 study . 
A total of 14/17 (82.4%) subjects reported 46 treatment -emergent AEs, none of which were 
considered related to rIX -FP by the investigator .  All AEs were mild or moderate in severity .  
There were no serious adverse e vents (SAEs) reported, and there were no withdrawals due to 
AEs.  No inhibitors to FIX were reported , and there were no clinically significant changes in 
serum biochemistry, hematology, urinalysis , or vital signs .  Before dosing with rIX -FP, 
1 subject had positive antibodies to rIX -FP, plasma -derived FIX , and BeneFIX .  However, by 
week 12, this subject tested negative for all antibodies tested (rIX -FP, plasma -derived FIX and 
BeneFIX®).   
All subjects receiving prophylaxis therapy were placed on a weekly (ie, 7-day treatment 
interval) rIX-FP treatment regimen throughout the study .  For each subject, the dose of rIX -FP 
was initially determined based upon the PK profile of rIX -FP and the subject’s  bleeding 
phenotype, but could be adjusted at the investigator’s discretion .   The mean FIX consumption

CRD-TPL-077 Confidential  was reduced  compared with the previous FIX therapy; the mean weekly dose  of rIX-FP was 
58.6 ± 10.7 IU/kg during the last 12  weeks of the study, compared  with a mean weekly dose of 
their previous product of 87.7  ± 45.8 IU/kg. 
In the prophylaxis treatment group, 8/13 (61.5%) subjects reported a total of 47 bleeding 
episodes that required treatment with rIX -FP.  In the on-demand treatment group (n = 4), all 
subjects (ie, 4 subjects) reported a total of 38  bleeding episode s that required treatment .  All 
bleeding episodes requiring treatment (n = 85) were successfully treated with 1 or 2 doses of 
rIX-FP.  The mean ABR was lower for both spontaneous  and total bleeding episodes in the 
prophylaxis group  (mean ± SD: spontaneous  ABR = 1.3  ± 1.5; total ABR = 4.4 ± 4.7; n = 13) 
compared with the on -demand treatment group (mean ± SD: spontaneous  ABR = 21.7 ± 4.0; 
total ABR = 26.8 ± 2.7; n = 4).  The annuali zed rate of  traumatic bleeding episodes  was similar 
for the prophylaxis and on -demand treatment groups .  In both treatment groups, t here were no 
major bleeding episodes and no maintenance d oses of rIX -FP required .   
The PK of rIX -FP were evaluated  in 13 subjects receiving either prophylactic or on -demand 
therapy.  After a single IV injection of 25 IU/kg rIX -FP, the mean FIX activity level was 3.75% 
and 2.67% above baseline at Day 7 and Day 14, respectively, and the mean half -life of rIX -FP 
was 95 hours.

prophylaxis therapy, subjects will either switch to a treatment interval of  10 or 14 days, 
or continue using a treatment interval of 7 days .  The dose of rIX -FP will be adjusted for 
each subject to target a trough FIX activity of  > 1% between doses .   
Subjects in Arm 2 (approximately 21 subjects) will receive on -demand treatment with
rIX-FP for approximately 26 weeks and then switch to prophylaxis therapy for the
remainder of the study (approximately 30 weeks) .  During prophylaxis  therapy, subjects
will administer rIX -FP (initial dose: 35 to 50  IU/kg) with a treatment interval  of 7 days.
The dose of rIX -FP will be adjusted for each subject to target a trough FIX activity
of > 1% between doses .
Study CSL654_3002, which will enro ll approximately 24 subjects (age: < 12 years), will 
consist of an initial 14 -day PK evaluation period, and an approximately 11 -month (50  exposure 
days [EDs]) treatment period, during which, subjects will receive prophylaxis therapy with 
rIX-FP (initial dos e: 35 to 50 IU/kg) administered with a treatment interval  of 7 days. 
Both studies (CSL654_3001 and CSL654_3002) will also evaluate the hemostatic efficacy of 
rIX-FP for surgical prophylaxis .

1.3STUDY OVERVIEW  
This is a prospective, open -label study to evaluate the long term safety and efficacy of 
rIX-FP, which is being developed for the prophylaxis and treatment of bleeding episodes in 
subjects with hemophilia B .  The study will include , but not limited to,  study subjects who 
were enrolled in  either Study CSL654_3001 or CSL654_3002 , in addition to the subjects 
requiring major non -emergency surgery who have not previously completed a CSL -
sponsored rIX-FP lead-in study. Previously untreated patients (PUPs) , who have never been 
treated with FIX clotting factor products (except previous exposure to blood components) and

age, including a minimum of 5 subjects < 6 years of age ) completed 50 EDs  and PK 
investigation s are completed (as required in EMA guideline) .  At the end of this study, 
subjects from the lead -in studies CSL654_3001 or CSL654_3002 are expected to have  
accumulated at least 100  rIX-FP EDs during enro llment in all CSL -sponsored rIX -FP studies .  
During the study, subjects may also participate in the surgical prophylaxis substudy  (see 
Appendix 1 ) or in the subcutaneous (SC) substudy (see Appendix 2 ).   
This extension study cons ists of a prophylaxis treatment period (up to approximately  5 years 
for Arms 1 , 2 and 3; up to approximately 3 years for Arm 4)  during which subjects will 
administer rIX -FP as routine prophylaxis .  During an initial 6 -month period, subjects will 
receive prophylactic treatment  with rIX-FP administ ered using the following treatment 
intervals: 
Arm 1: Once every 7, 10, or 14 days  (subjects who have completed  studies
CSL654_3001 Arm 1  or CSL654_3002 , or any other CSL -sponsored rIX -FP [CSL654]
lead-in study).
Arm 2: Once every 7 days (subjects from Study CSL654_3001 Arm 2 with less than  26
weeks of experience with weekly prophylaxis ) or once every 14 days (subjects from
Study CSL654_3001 Arm 2 with at least 26 -weeks experience with weekly
prophylaxis) .
Arm 3: Once every 7 days (subjects who have not previously completed a CSL -
sponsored rIX -FP [CSL654] lead-in study).  No subjects in France may enroll in Arm  3.
After this initial 6 -month period , all subjects in Arm 1, 2 and 3 will receive pr ophylactic therapy 
with rIX-FP administered once every 7, 10, 14, or 21 days for an additional approximately 
30 months.  Subjects in France may not take part in the 21-day treatment regimen.  Subjects 
transferring to a 21 -day treatment interval  must be ≥ 18  years of age.  Any subject transferring 
to a 21-day treatment interval  for the first time must  have completed at least 6 months of 
prophylactic treatment with a 14 -day treatment interval  and must undergo an initial PK

CRD-TPL-077 Confidential  evaluation period with a single rIX -FP dose of 100 IU/kg.  During the study, a subject may  
undergo additional rIX -FP PK evaluations at the investigator’s discretion or CSL’s request.  
Subjects in Arm 3 who require major non -emergency surgery will undergo a n initial PK 
evaluation (100 IU/kg  rIX-FP) to determine the incremental recovery and FIX activity.  These 
subjects will then complete the surgery substudy (see Appendix 1 ) after which they may start 
the prophylaxis treatment period.  
If any subject from a lead -in study requires a major or minor surgical non -emergency procedure 
during the prophylaxis treatment period , the subject may be enrolled in the surgery substudy 
(see Appendix 1 ).   
Arm 4: During an initial 6 -month period, subjects will receive prophylactic treatment  with 
rIX-FP administered  using once every 7 days as preferred regimen.  Nevertheless , during the 
first 12 months, subjects may also receive on -demand and / or prevention treatment only.   
Subjects in Arm 4 will undergo a n rIX-FP (50 IU/kg) PK evaluation at Day 1 as the first dose 
if feasible or during the study after at least 7 days washout from the previous rIX -FP dose, 
when the subject is in non -bleeding state.  
If any Arm 4 subjects require  a minor surgical non -emergency procedure during the study,  
the subject may be enrolled in  the surgery substudy (see Appendix 1 ).   
Subcutaneous Substudy (see Appendix 2 ) 
Subjects enrolled in the SC substudy w ill be sequentially assigned to a dose cohort (Cohort 1 
[single dose of 25 IU/kg], Cohort 2 [single dose of 50 IU/kg], Cohort 3 [15 doses of 25 IU/kg 
every 3 days], and an optional Cohort 4 [15 doses of ≤ 50 IU/kg every 5 days, with the actual 
dose in this  cohort to be determined by CSL based on the PK results from Cohort 3 ]).

CRD-TPL-077 Confidential  Subjects will return 2 weeks after their last SC dose for an end  of substudy visit to collect the 
final SC PK sample and assess safety. After the end  of substudy visit, Cohort 3 and  4 subjects 
will return to their IV rIX -FP prophylaxis regimen in the main study.  
1.4 POTENTIAL RISKS AND BENEFITS  
The use of a replacement FIX product  with a longer half -life and better recovery rate than 
currently available products should enable a longer interval between infusions for patients with 
hemophilia B .  By reducing the burden on patients and physicians treating this disorder, such 
a product may also result in an improvement in patient compliance .  In addition, it may permit 
primary prophylaxis in some young children without requiring the insertion of a venous access 
device. 
Potential risks associated with rIX -FP are expected to be similar to the currently marketed 
recombinant FIX products and include the development of antibodies  against FIX  and 
development of thromboembolic complications .  In addition, there is a risk of development of 
albumin and CHO cell -derived protein antibodies .  The potential risks associated with 
treatment with rIX -FP are discussed in detail in Section 7.4 of the Investigator’s Brochure . 
The results from the rIX -FP nonclinical program and the data from previous clinical studies, 
support the evaluation of an rIX-FP treatment interval  of between 7 and 14 days.  The safety 
and efficacy of rIX-FP (100 IU/kg) using a 21-day treatment interval  will also be e xamined in 
this study .  Given that nonclinical studies in rats and cynomolgus monkeys have shown a no 
observed adverse effect level  of 500 IU/kg, there is not expected to be any additional safety 
concerns regarding the use of rIX -FP at a dose of 100 IU/kg .  There is a risk that administration 
of rIX-FP at a treatment interval  of 21 days might be less effective at preventin g bleeds than  
when administered at a treatment interval  of 14 days or less .  However, the PK evaluation of 
rIX-FP at a dose of 100 IU/kg will provide information on the trough  FIX activity  level using 
this dose of rIX -FP.  In addition, prophylaxis treatmen t using a 21 -day treatment interval  will 
only be available to subjects ≥ 18 years of age and who have completed at least 6 months of 
prophylaxis treatment with a 14 -day treatment interval , with subjects in France excluded .  If

7-, 10-, or 14-day treatment interval  at any time, at the d iscretion of the investigator.  
This study will  document all key safety factors including immunogenicity, thrombogenicity, 
hypersensitivity, and other AEs in the intended therapeutic population . 
Thus, the associated benefit-risk assessment of the study is acceptable for subjects enrolled in 
the study.

of rIX-FP administered will be based on the subject’s clinical response, PK information or FIX 
trough activity . 
3.1.2 Routine Prophylaxis : 6 Months to End of Treatment Period  
After completion of the initial 6-month treatment period, subjects from Arms 1, 2 and 3 will 
administer rIX -FP as routine prophylaxis using a treatment interval  of 7, 10, or 14 days for the 
remainder of the study .  Subjects from lead -in Study CSL654_3001 Arm 2, who were using a 
7-day treatment interval  during the previous 6 months, will switch to a 14 -day treatment
interval for at least 6 months.
From 6 months onwards , subjects (Arm 1, 2 and 3) may use the same treatment interval  or they 
may change treatment interval  in consultation with the investigator at any of the subsequent 
6-month follow -up visits (see Section 3.2.1.2).  For the first  12 months of the study, subjects
in Arm 4 are encouraged, but not required , to be on weekly prophylaxis. The dose of rIX -FP
administered will be between 35 and 75 IU/kg (see Section 6.2.1).
Subjects ≥ 18 years of age may also administer rIX -FP as routine prophylaxis u sing a 21-day 
treatment interval  at a dose of 100 IU/ kg.  Subjects in France may NOT switch to a routine 
prophylaxis regimen using a 21 -day treatment interval. Subjects < 18 years of age are not 
permitted to use a treatment interval  of 21 days.  
Subjects who transfer to a 21 -day treatment interval  for the fir st time must have completed at 
least 6 months of prophylaxis treatment with a 14 -day treatment interval  and have undergone 
PK evaluation with 100 IU/kg rIX -FP (see Section 3.1.3). 
3.1.3 Pharmacokinetic  Evaluation of rIX -FP (100 IU/kg)  
Subjects must undergo a PK evaluation with a single injection of rIX -FP (100 IU/kg) if either 
1)they are in  Arm 3 (excludes subjects in France) or 2) they intend to begin a dministering rIX -

Amendment 6  03 February  2020 Page 55 of 187 
CRD-TPL-077 Confidential  FP as routine prophylaxis using a 21 -day treatment interval  for the first time .  The PK 
evaluation should be performed after a washout period of either at least 4 days for a current 
marketed FIX product (Arm 3) or at least 14 days  for rIX-FP.  Samples for PK evaluation  will 
be collected before administration of rIX-FP, 30 minutes after the completion of the injection 
(to evaluate peak FIX activity level and incremental recovery ) and at specified time  points after 
injection (see Table B - Schedule of Assessments: Pharmacokinetic Period ).      
3.1.3.1 Pharmacokinetic Evaluation of rIX -FP as Needed 
The investigator may also ch oose to complete a PK assessment of 50, 75 or 100 IU/kg (as 
appropriate) rIX-FP with selected time  points before starting surgical prophylaxis with rIX -FP 
(for subjects from lead -in studies) , at the investigato r’s discretion or CSL’s request, or  in the 
event of (but not limited to) poor efficacy or suspicion of inhibitor development.  Subjects in 
France may be discontinued from receiving the study product and participating in any further 
study procedures if the subject is confirmed to have develop ed an inhibitor against FIX with a 
titer > 5 BU/mL.  
3.1.3.2 Pharmacokinetic Evaluation of rIX -FP for Arm 4  
For Arm 4 subjects, a PK assessment of 50 IU/kg rIX -FP with selected time  points (Table B - 
Schedule of Assessments: Pharmacok inetic Period ) or incremental recovery is to be done only 
at the beginning of the study , and also may be done at the investigato r’s discretion at any time.  
3.1.4 On-demand Treatment of Bleeding Episodes 
During the study, on -demand treatment with rIX -FP will be used for all bleeding episodes 
requiring treatment .  The dose of rIX -FP will be determined by the investigator, based on the 
subject’s previous experience during the lead -in study or this study , and the dose and / or 
maintenance dose required to achieve and maintain the FIX activity level recommended by the

CRD-TPL-077 Confidential  3.1.5 Preventative  Treatment Before Vigorous Physical Activity  or Physical Therapy  
During the study, subjects may also administer rIX -FP as a single injection immediately before 
vigorous physical activity that, in the subject’s experience, is likely to result in bleeding or 
before physical therapy (ie, rehabilitation after surgery) (see Section 3.2.3).  The recommended 
dose of rIX -FP is between 35 and 50 IU/kg, administered as a single injection . 
3.1.6 Surgical Prophylaxis  
All subjects in Arm 3  (excludes subjects in France)  should start the surgery substudy (Appendix 
1) within 8 weeks from receiving the  first rIX-FP injection (ie, during the PK evaluation 
period).  
If a subject in either Arms 1 or 2 requ ires major or minor  non-emergency  surgery or subject in 
Arm 4 requires minor surgery during the study, the subject may also be enrolled in the surgery 
substudy.  A major surgery is defined as a surgical procedure that involves anesthesia (general, 
spinal, epidural, or regional block) or respiratory assistance or one that requires hemostatic 
support for a period exceeding 5  consecutive days (including but not limite d to orthopedic and 
cardiac surgery)  [Srivastava  et al., 2013 ].  However, some common surgeries (such as 
permanent venous access placement or removal, circumcision and some simple dental 
procedures) for the subject s in Arm 4 may not be able to be avoided, therefore, they may be 
permitted in consultation with the CSL medical monitor.  Details of the surgery substudy, 
including study design, visit schedules and study assessments are presented in Appendix 1 . 
If a subject requires an extremely minor surgical procedure during the study (ie, a procedure 
that would be expected to require only a maintenance dose of rIX -FP after the procedure), the 
subject may be administered a single prophylaxis injection of rIX -FP before the surgery , 
without enrol lment into the surgery substudy.

3.2.1 Routine Prophylaxis Treatment  
3.2.1.1 rIX-FP Treatment Interval 
During the first 6 months of th e study, subjects or their care givers will administer rIX -FP as 
routine prophylaxis using  the following treatment intervals:  
Arm 1: 7, 10, or 14 days .
Arm 2: 7 or 14 days .
Arm 3: 7 days. (No subjects in France may participate in Arm 3)
Arm 4: 7 days ( preferred for the first 12 months of the study; required after the first 12
months of the study) .
For subjects in Arm 1,  the treatment interval  will be chosen by the investigator at the beginning 
of the study based on the subject’s previous experience (ie, during the lead -in study) and subject 
preference .   
For subjects in Arm 2, the treatment interval  will be based on the duration of their prophylaxis  
treatment in the lead -in study; a 14-day treatment interval will be assigned to subjects who 
completed at least 26 weeks of prophylaxis treatment  during the lead -in study and a 7-day 
treatment interval  will be assigned to subjects who did not complete at least 26  weeks of 
prophylaxis treatment  during the lead -in study.  Subjects  in Arm 2  who start on a 7 -day 
treatment interval and complete a total (ie, during the lead -in study and this study) of at least 
26 weeks of prophylaxis treatment , should then switch to a 14-day treatment interval  for a 
period of at least 6 months .   
Upon completion of the surgery substudy, subjects in Arm 3 (not applicable to France) may 
begin the prophylaxis treatment period in the main study.  During the first 6 months, subjects 
in this group will administer rIX -FP as routine prophylaxis using a treatment interval of 7 days.  
The dose (25 to 50 IU/kg) of rIX -FP administered will be based on the subject’s trough FIX 
activity (see Section 6.2.1). 
Study Number:  CSL654_3003  
Study Product:  rIX-FP 
Amendment 6  03 February  2020 Page 58 of 187 
CRD-TPL-077 Confidential  At the end of the initial 6 -month period, subjects in Arm 1, 2 and 3 may remain on their current 
treatment interval  or they may be switched to a 7, 10, or 14-day treatment interval .  Subjects 
≥ 18 years of age may also be switched to a  21-day treatment interval  after completing at least 
6 months of a 14-day prophylaxis regimen and a 100 IU/kg rIX -FP PK evaluation period (see 
Section 3.1.3). Subjects in France may NOT switch to a routine prophylaxis regimen using a 
21-day treatment i nterval.
3.2.1.2 Changing the rIX -FP Treatment interval  (subjects in Arm 1, 2 and 3)  
During each 6  months of the treatment period, the treatment interval  should not be changed 
unless deemed necessary by the investigator for the subject’s safety  (with the exception of 
subjects from lead -in Study CSL654_3001 Arm 2 who have < 26 weeks experience with 
prophylaxis rIX -FP therapy with a 7 -day treatment interval ).  At the end of each 6 -month period 
(ie, at the 6 month, 12 month, etc follow-up visits) the investiga tor may choose to change the 
treatment interval  based on their assessment of efficacy  / safety, subject treatment compliance, 
and / or subject preference.  
3.2.1.3 Changing the rIX -FP Treatment interval (subjects in Arm 4)  
During the first 12 -month period, subjects  in Arm 4 are encouraged, but not required to be on 
weekly prophylaxis regimen with rIX -FP.  At the end of the initial 12 -month period, subjects 
are required to be on  a weekly prophylaxis regimen for rest of the study.   
3.2.1.4 rIX-FP Dose 
The dose of rIX -FP administered for routine prophylaxis will be based on the subject’s previous 
experience (ie, during a lead -in study) and / or the targeted FIX activity trough level (target 
FIX activity level > 2%, but optimally , between 5% and 15%).  The FIX activity trough level 
must not be targeted to ≥ 20% without approval from CSL.  
The maximum dose of rIX -FP for routine prophylaxis will be  50 IU/kg per injection for 
subjects using a 7 -day treatment interval  and 75 IU/kg per injection for subjects u sing a 10- or 
14-day treatment interval (Table 1), unless a higher dose for a given subject  is approved  by

1.The 10-day treatment interval may be based on a schedule of once every 10 calendar days or 3 times a month
(ie, 1st, 11th and 21st day of each month).
2.An rIX-FP dose higher than 50 IU/kg is acceptable if the FIX activity trough level is < 5% at Day 7 and a
higher trough level is necessary to prevent spontaneous bleeding.
3.2.2 On-demand Treatment of Bleeding Episodes  
On-demand treatment with rIX -FP will be used for all bleeding episodes requiring treatment .  
If a subject experiences a bleeding episode, rIX -FP should be administered within 4 hours  after 
the start of the bleeding episode .  The dose of rIX -FP will be determined by the investigator, 
based on the effective on-demand treatment dose used in the lead -in study and  / or the subject’s 
PK data with a minimum rIX -FP dose of 35 IU/kg  and a maximum dose of 75 IU/kg .  After 
hemostasis is achieved, maintenance dose(s) of rIX -FP may be prescribed at the discretion of 
the investigator .   
Subjects receiving on -demand treatment for a bleeding episode should maintain or delay (but 
not skip) the prophylaxis treatment schedule, at the investigator’s discretion.  The window 
between the last treatment for the bleeding episo de and the next prophylaxis injection should 
not be longer than the number of days of the current treatment interval (ie, 7, 10, 14 , or 21 days).  
In addition, any two injections of rIX -FP should be at least 24 hours apart.

CRD-TPL-077 Confidential  3.2.3 Prevention  Before Vigorous Physical Activity  or Physical Therapy  
During the study, subjects may administer rIX -FP as a preventative treatment before vigorous 
physical activity or before physical therapy (ie, as a part of rehabilitation after  major surgery) 
that, in the subject’s experien ce, is likely to result in bleeding .  rIX-FP should be administered 
as preventative treatment  at a dose of 35 to 50 IU/kg, as determined by the investigator based 
on the subject’s previous experience.   
Preventative treatment  should be administered in addition to routine prophylactic treatment (ie, 
subjects administering rIX -FP as a preventative treatment should maintain the routine 
prophylaxis treatment schedule ) or may be combined with on -demand regimen  (may combine 
with prevention doses)  during the first 12  months in Arm 4 subjects  only. 
Prevention Before Vigorous Physical Activity  
Preventative treatment  before vigorous physical activity  should not be used more frequently  
than once per month . If more frequent treatment is re quired (eg, because of participation in 
regular sporting activities) , the treatment interval or dose used for prophylaxis treatment should 
be adjusted, as appropriate (eg, reduction of the treatment interval from 14 days to 7  days or 
increase in the rIX -FP dose if the subject is using a 7 -day treatment interval).   
Prevention Before Physical Therapy  
Preventative treatment  before physical therapy  should not be used more frequently  than once 
per week  during the first 3 months  of either starting the prophylaxis  treatment period (subjects 
in Arm 3) or returning to routine prophylaxis  (subjects in Arm s 1 or 2). After this 3-month 
period, preventative treatment should not be used more often than once per month . 
3.3 PLANNED STUDY D URATION  
For subjects in Arms  1, 2, and 3, the duration of the study for an individual subject is expected 
to be approximately 5 years or the time it takes to achieve a total of 100 EDs  during enrollment 
in any CSL -sponsored rIX -FP studies . For subjects in Arm 4, the duration of the study is

discretion . 
In the SC substudy, s ubjects will be sequentially assigned to a dose cohort, and receive a single 
SC dose of rIX -FP (25 IU/kg in Cohort 1; 50 IU/kg in Cohort 2) or repeated SC doses of rIX -
FP (25 IU/kg every 3 days in Cohort 3; ≤ 50 IU/kg every 5 days  in optional Cohort 4, with the 
actual dose in this cohort to be determined by CSL based on the PK results from Cohort 3 ).

The actual IU , which is printed on the rIX -FP vial label, will be used for t he calculation and 
documentation of each dose of rIX -FP.  
When making the dose calculation, t he total actual units (ie, as per  the prescribed dose) may 
be rounded up or down  to target full vials  (as actual IU) , if possible , but the final dose  needs to 
be within 10% of the prescribed dose.   The dose of rIX -FP is based on the subject’s most 
current body weight as recorded in the eCRF .  
6.2.1 Adjustment of Dose for Prophylaxis and On-demand Treatment  
The dose of rIX -FP required for either prophylaxis o r on-demand treatment will be based on 
the subject’s previous experience (ie, during Study CSL654_3001 or CSL654_3002) and  / or 
the target FIX activity .  The following formula will be used to calculate dose based on FIX 
activity:

6.3TREATMENT COMPLIANCE  
Subjects will record the dose, time of the dose  and rIX-FP consumption for prophylaxis , 
prevention  and on-demand treatment of bleeding episodes in the eDiary .  In addition, subjects 
will bring all of their used vials (and unused, if requested ) of rIX-FP to the study site at every 
visit.  Treatment compliance will be monitored by counting  the number of returned vials , the 
results of which will be recorded in the Drug Accountability Log .  rIX-FP use, as reported  by 
the subject  in the eDiary, will also be reconciled to the returned vials.  
For prophylaxis treatment, a subject will be regarded as compliant with treatment if  both 
criteria below are met : 
Regimen compliance: The subject receives at least 80% of the injections  of rIX-FP at
the scheduled injection frequency during the study period  where dosing is expected to
occur within the following target days:
oFor the 7-day treatment interval : injection of rIX -FP occurs between Days 6 and 8
after the previous prophylaxis injection.
oFor the 10 -day treatment interval  (ie, every 10 days or 3 times per month): injection
of rIX-FP occurs between Days 8 and 11 after the previous pr ophylaxis injection.
oFor the 14 -day treatment interval : injection of rIX -FP occurs between Days 13 and
15 after the previous prophylaxis injection.
oFor the 21 -day treatment interval  (not applicable to subjects in France) : injection of
rIX-FP occurs between Days 20 and 22 after the previous prophylaxis injection.
Dose compliance: The subject receives 80 % to 120% of the prescribed dose, based on
the actual dose, for at least 80% of injections .

8.3CONTROL OF MAJOR BLE EDING EPISODES  
Major bleeding episodes are defined as a bleed for which a subject is required to seek treatment 
at the hemophilia center from the treating physician .  A major bleeding episode includes intra -
cranial hemorrhage, gastroin testinal, and severe bleeding into a joint or muscle  (ie. iliopsoas 
muscle).  All other bleeding episodes will be classified as minor / moderate unless the 
investigator assessment notes otherwise .   
The investigator will record the following in the eCRF:  
Reason for use of rIX-FP and type of the bleeding episode (spontaneous,  traumatic,
unknown, or post-surgery).
Time of the start of bleeding .
Dose of rIX -FP (IU/kg) .

blood loss greater th an what is defined as Good  
Poor / No response  Severely abnormal hemostasis in term s of quantity and  / or quality 
(eg, severe hemorrhage that is difficult to control) and  / or additional 
hemostatic intervention required with other F IX product,

8.4CONTROL OF MINOR AND  MODERATE BLEEDING E PISODES (A rm 4 
only) 
Caregivers of Arm 4 subjects will record information  (see Section 8.2) in the eeDiary on the 
bleeding episode and treatment received by the subject at home after the caregiver has been 
trained on home infusion.  If the subject receives tre atment at the site, the investigator will

CRD-TPL-077 Confidential  The caregiver should contact site study staff at approximately 24 hours after the first treatment 
dose for the bleeding epi sode to report the response to treatment, including objective  signs of 
bleeding (ie, swelling, tenderness, and  / or decreased range of motion in the case of 
musculoskeletal hemorrhage)  and to discuss if additional treatment or maintenance dose will 
be needed.    
The response t o rIX-FP treatment will be evaluated via a 4-point scale (Table 4) by the 
Investigator at each Visit after a review of the treatment record .   
Table 4.  Efficacy Evaluation for Treatment of Minor and Moderate  Bleeding Episodes  
Excellent  
(effective)  No additional infusion required after the first infusion in order to 
achieve hemostasis, unmistakable/obvious improvement in objective 
signs of bleeding (ie, swelling, tenderness, and  / or decreased range of 
motion in the case of musc uloskeletal hemorrhage) approximately 24 
hours after the first FIX infusion.  
Good 
(effective)  Requires a second infusion in order to achieve hemostasis,  
significant/recognized improvement in signs of bleeding at 
approximately 24 hours after the first in fusion.   
Moderate  
(not effective)  Requires more than two infusions to achieve hemostasis, and s light 
beneficial effect at approximately 24  hours after the first infusion.  
Poor/No response  
(not effective)  Requires additional hemostatic intervention with other FIX product, 
or plasma to achieve hemostasis and no improvement at all or 
condition worsens (ie, signs of bleeding) at approximately 24 hours 
after the first infusion.   
The Investigator rating of hemostatic efficacy will take into account both the number of 
infusions required to achieve hemostasis (primary factor for PI’s assessment) and the objective 
signs of bleeding approximately 24 hours after the first infusion  as reported to the site by the 
caregiver or observed by site personnel.   
8.5 TREATMENT FOR A SURG ICAL PROCEDURE  
If a non-emergency surgical procedure is necessary, the subject may be enrolled in the surgery

Amendment 6  03 February  2020 Page 79 of 187 
CRD-TPL-077 Confidential  8.6INHIBITORS AND ANTIBODIES  
The presence of antibodies against rIX -FP and CHO cells and inhibitors of FIX will be assessed 
by the central laboratory .  Details regarding sample collection, handling, deep freezing of 
samples and shipment to the central laboratory are given in the Laboratory Manual in the 
Investigator Site File.  
A tiered approach for immunogenicity testing for antibodies to rIX-FP will be employed during 
the study:  
1.Screening assay : The screening assay is a direct -binding ELISA assay, capable of
detecting antibodies against rIX -FP in blood samples from subjects.
2.Confirmation assays : If the antibody titer is above the cut -off level for the screening
assay, the same sample  will be tested in a separate direct -binding ELISA assay to
confirm the specific antibody signal and to discriminate between plasma -derived FIX,
rIX-FP, and albumin antibodies .  In the event that all confirmation assays are negative,
the screening assay will be considered a false positive result.
3.Neutralization assay for inhibitors : The neutralizing capacity of antibodies will be
assessed by a FIX potency assay .  To quantify anti -FIX neutralizing antibodies, the
Bethesda assay with the Nijmegen modification will be used, and the results expressed
as Bethesda Units per mL (BU/mL).
In cases where the inhibitor titer is determined to be above the cut -off level (0.6 BU/mL), a 
second blood sample should be collected and be tested by the central laboratory for 
confirmation, and additional testing such as PK  / incremental recovery tests will be performed .  
The subject’s information will be presented to the SMT and IDMC  for its recommendati on. 
8.7RETENTION OF SAMPLES  
Retention samples of serum will be obtained  before the first dose of rIX -FP (subjects in Arms 3 
and 4 only) and  at the end of study visit for later viral safety testing , if needed and with the 
subject’s consent . Retention samples  will be stored by CSL for 5 years .

9. ADVERSE EVENT S 
9.1 DEFINITIO NS 
9.1.1 Adverse Event  
As per the ICH  guidelines , an AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical 
investigation subject administered a  pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily 
 Study Number:  CSL654_3003  
Study Product:  rIX-FP 
 
Amendment 6  03 February  2020 Page 95 of 187 
CRD-TPL-077 Confidential  have a causal relationship with this treatment .  An AE can, therefore, be any unfavorable and 
unintended sign (including an abnormal, clinically significant laboratory findi ng), symptom, 
or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether 
or not considered related to the medicinal (investigational) product .   
The period of observation for AEs extends from the time the subject gives informed consent 
until the end of study (see Section 9.4 for further details).  
Adverse event s may include:  
 Exacerbation (ie, an increase in the freq uency or severity) of a pre -existing condition .  
Illness present before study entry should be recorded in the medical history section of 
the eCRF and only be reported as an AE if there is an increase in the frequency or 
severity of the condition during the  study.   
 A clinical event occurring after consent but before rIX-FP administration.  
 Intercurrent illnesses with an onset after administration of rIX-FP. 
Adverse events do not include: 
 A bleeding episode that occurs as a result of the subject’s unchanged, pre -existing 
hemophilia condition . 
 Events identified at baseline that meet exclusion criteria . 
 Medical or surgical procedures (the condition that leads to the procedure may be 
reported as  the AE, as appropriate ). 
 A trauma itself, however, an injury other than bleeding (eg, bone fracture) resulting 
from the trauma should be documented as an AE.  
 Situations where an untoward medical occurrence has not taken place .  For example:  
o Planned hospitalizations due to pre -existing conditions, which have not worsened . 
o Hospitalizations that occur for procedures not due to an AE (eg, cosmetic surgery , 
elective surgery or social admission ). 
o Hospitalizations for a diagnostic procedure where the h ospital stay is less than 
24 hours in duration or for normal disease management procedures . 
 Study Number:  CSL654_3003  
Study Product:  rIX-FP 
 
Amendment 6  03 February  2020 Page 96 of 187 
CRD-TPL-077 Confidential   Overdose of rIX-FP or any concomitant therapy that does not  result in any adverse 
signs or symptoms .   
If a bleeding episode occurs, whether spontaneous  or as the result of trauma or injury, ONLY 
the injury should be recorded as an AE or SAE .  The bleeding episode, whether spontaneous 
or resulting from the injury, should  not be recorded as an AE, but as a bleeding episode on 
the appropriate eCRF page .   
For laboratory safety parameters, any instances of absolute values  being outside the reference 
range or changes at any visit aft er study start  that are considered by the investigator as clinically 
significant must recorded in the  eCRF as AEs.  In addition, at the investigator’s discretion, any 
changes or trends over time in laboratory parameters can be recorded in the eCRF as AEs if 
such changes or trends are considered to be clinically relevant, even if the absolute values are 
within the reference range.  
Laboratory findings do not need to be reported as AEs in the following cases:  
 Laboratory parameters already beyond the reference range at Day 1 of the lead -in study 
(subjects in Arms 1 or 2 ) or at screening ( subjects in Arm 3  or Arm 4), unless a further 
increase/decrease can be considered an exacerbation of a pre -existing condition .   
 Abnormal laboratory parameters caused by mechanical or physical influences on the 
blood sample (eg, in vitro hemolysis) and flagged as such by the laboratory in the 
laboratory report.  
 Abnormal parameters that are obviously biologically implausible (eg, values that are 
incompatible with life  or outside the measuring range ). 
 An abnormal laboratory value that cannot be confirmed after repeat analysis, p referably 
in the same laboratory (ie, the previous result could be marked as not valid and should 
not necessarily be reported as an AE) .

Amendment 6  03 February  2020 Page 97 of 187 
CRD-TPL-077 Confidential  9.1.2 Adverse Event s of Special Interest  
There are several AEs that will be monitored closely as adverse events of special interest 
(AESIs) to enable an adequate risk -benefit evaluation of rIX-FP versus standard therapy during 
the study and additional data may be requested for these events .  The AESIs will be:  
 AEs associated with confirmed (ie, with second blood sample)  inhibitor formation .  
 Thrombotic and / or embolic events.  
 Anaphylaxis . 
AESIs should be considered medically significant and are therefore SAEs .  The expedited 
reporting procedures for  SAEs are described in detail in Section 9.6. 
9.1.3 Serious Adverse Event  
An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
 Results in death  – The event must be the cause of death for the SAE to meet this 
serious criterion.  
 Is life-threatening  – The term “life -threatening” refers to an event in which the subject 
was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event that 
hypothetically might have caused death if it had been more severe.  
 Requires in -patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  – 
CSL considers “hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization” for at least 
24 hours as the defining criterion for an SAE .  Hospital admissions for planned surge ry 
or for normal disease management procedures (eg, for treating major bleeding episodes , 
diagnostic procedures, admission or procedures that are not considered AEs [see Section 
9.1.1]) are not considered as defining criteria for SAEs .   
 Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity.  
 Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect.  
 Is medically significant  – A medically significant event is d efined as an event that does 
not necessarily meet any of the SAE criteria, but which is judged by a physician to 
potentially jeopardize the subject or require medical or surgical intervention to prevent 
one of the above outcomes listed as an SAE criterion.

Study Product:  rIX-FP 
 
Amendment 6  03 February  2020 Page 98 of 187 
CRD-TPL-077 Confidential  Adverse events that do not fall into the above categories are defined as nonserious AEs.  
9.2 SEVERITY OF ADVERSE EVENTS  
The severity of each AE  (ie, nonserious and SAEs) is to be assessed by the investigator as 
follows: 
Severity Definition  
Mild A type of AE that is usually transient and may require only minimal treatment or 
therapeutic intervention .  The event does not generally interfere with usual activities 
of daily living.  
Moderate  A type of AE that is usually alleviated  with additional specific therapeutic 
intervention .  The event interferes with usual activities of daily living, causing 
discomfort but poses no significant or permanent risk of harm to the subject. 
Severe A type of AE that interrupts usual activities of daily living, or significantly affects 
clinical status, or may require intensive therapeutic intervention.  
CDISC SDTM Severity Intensity Scale for Adverse Event Terminology  
9.3 CAUSALITY OF ADVERSE  EVENTS  
The causal relationship of an AE to rIX-FP must always be assessed by the investigator .  All 
AEs will be classified as either related or not related  to rIX-FP.  If a causality assessment is 
not provided  for an AE (including an SAE) at the time of database lock , that AE will be 
considered related to rIX-FP.   
The degree of certainty with which an AE is attributed to  rIX-FP or an alternative cause 
(eg, natural history of the underlying disease, concomitant therapy) will be determined by how 
well the event can be understood in terms of:  
 Known pharmacology of rIX-FP. 
 Clinically and  / or pathophysiologically plausible context.  
 Reaction of a similar nature previously observed with similar products, or reported in 
the literature for similar products as being product related (eg, headache, facial flushing, 
pallor).

Study Product:  rIX-FP 
 
Amendment 6  03 February  2020 Page 99 of 187 
CRD-TPL-077 Confidential   Plausibility support ed by the temporal relationship  (eg, the event being related by time 
to administration or termination of treatment with rIX-FP, drug withdrawal  or 
reproduced on rechallenge ). 
9.4 OBSERVATION PERIOD F OR ADVERSE EVENTS 
The observat ion period for AE (and SAE) reporting in an individual subject will start at the 
time of giving written informed consent for participation in the current study and finish with 
the end of study visit .   
If the investigator becomes aware of an SAE that has s tarted after the observation period has 
finished, and the event could in some way be associated with rIX-FP, then this must also be 
reported to CSL and included in the clinical database  (see Section 9.6). 
9.5 ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING  
9.5.1 Adverse Events  
At each clinical evaluation, the investigator (or delegate) will determine whether any AEs have 
occurred.  AEs will be recorded in the AE page of the eCRF .  If known, the medical diagnosis 
of an AE should be recorded in preference to the listing of individual signs and symptoms .  The 
investigator must follow up on the course of an AE until resolution  or stabilization .  If an AE 
is ongoing after the end of study visit , the AE will continue to be followed up until resolution, 
stabilization, or for 30 days after the final administration of rIX-FP during the study , whichever 
is sooner. 
9.5.2 Adverse Events of Special Interest  
Any AESI should be reported as an SAE as described in detail in Section 9.6.

This study will comply with all applicable regulatory requirements and adhere to the full 
requirements of ICH Topic E2A (Clinical Safety Data Management: Defi nitions and Standards 
for Expedited Reporting).  
For SAEs occurring during the study, the investigator or delegate will enter all relevant 
information in the AE page of the eCRF.  An electronic document containing the AE page and 
other applicable pages of t he eCRF must be sent (via facsimile or email) to the sponsor together 
with a Notification of Serious Adverse Event at Investigator Site  cover page, which has 
been signed and dated by the Investigator .  If an electronic document is not able to be generated 
(eg, internet access problem), a handwritten paper SAE report must be completed, which must 
be signed and dated by the investigator .   
All SAEs that occur during the course of the study, whether or not causally related to 
rIX-FP, must be reported immediately (within 24 hours of the investigator becoming 
aware of the event) to CSL .  For Japan sites only, the investigator  must also inform the 
head of the medical institution  of the SAE and related information in accordance with the 
Japanese regulatory requirements and ICH GCP.  
Adverse events occurring in the period between  the times the subject gave written informed 
consent and the first exposure to rIX-FP that meet one or more of the seriousness criteria for 
AEs must be reported to CSL in the same manner as other SAEs and will be included in the 
clinical study database .   
Any SAE that occurs after the end of study visit that is considered  to be causally related to rIX-
FP must be reported immediately ( ie, within 24 hours of the investigator becoming aware 
of the event) to CSL .  For Japan sites only, the investigator  must also inform the head of 
the medical institution  of the SAE and related information in accordance with the Japanese 
regulatory requirements and ICH GCP.

starts. 
9.6.1 Requirements for Immediate Reporting of  Serious Adverse Event s 
The minimum reporting requirements for immediate reporting of SAEs include:  
 Identifiable subject.  
 Suspected medicinal product and  / or procedure.  
 Event term. 
 Identifiable reporting source.  
In addition, the investigator must: 
 Report all SAEs to the relevant Institutional Review Board (IRB) / Independent Ethics 
Committee  (IEC) within the timeframe  specified by the IRB / IEC . 
 Submit follow -up reports to CSL Clinical Safety and Pharmacovigilance until the SAE 
has resolved, o r, in the case of permanent impairment, until stabilized.  
 Ensure that the causality assessment for all SAEs is entered in the eCRF.  
If the minimum requirements for reporting are fulfilled, the investigator should not wait to 
receive additional information to fully document the event before notifying CSL.   
When submitting SAE reports and any other related reports (eg, discharge summaries) to CSL, 
subjects should be identified only by their  subject number and study number .  The investigator 
should not includ e the subject’s name , date of birth, or  address. 
In cases of death, the investigator should supply CSL and the IRB / IEC (as applicable) with 
any additional information as it becomes available (eg, autopsy reports and detailed medical 
reports). 
The procedure to be followed if an ongoing AE becomes an SAE after the end of the 
observation period for AEs is described in Section 9.9.

CRD-TPL-077 Confidential  9.7 OTHER SIGNIFICANT EVENT REPORTING  
9.7.1 Overdose  
Any overdose that is considered by the investigator to be medically significant and resulting 
in adverse signs and symptoms must be reported as an SAE ( see Section 9.6). 
9.7.2 Pregnancy and Lactation  
The subject must immediately notify the investigator if his female partner becomes pregnant 
while participating in the study, or up to and including 30 days after the last dose of rIX -FP.   
CSL must be notified within 5 days of the investigator becoming aware of the pregnancy.  
Whenever possible, a pregnancy in a f emale partner of a male subject exposed to rIX -FP should 
be followed to term so as to assess any potential occurrence of congenital anomalies or birth 
defects.  Any follow -up information, including premature termination and the status of the 
mother and chi ld after delivery, should be reported by the investigator to CSL using a 
Pregnancy Reporting / Outcome Form .   
9.8 IRB / IEC REPORTING REQUIR EMENTS  
The time frame within which an IRB  / IEC must be notified of deaths and investigational  
product-related unexpect ed SAEs is stipulated by each IRB  / IEC.  It is the investigator’s 
responsibility to comply with the requirements for IRB  / IEC notification .  CSL will provide 
investigators with all details of all SAEs reported to regulatory authorities.  
9.9 FOLLOW -UP OF ADVERSE EVENTS

noted here or in the SAP, overall summaries may be further broken down by lead -in study (and 
by Arm in Study CSL654_3001)  or new subjects , age group, or geographic region.  
Efficacy summaries and analyses of surgical data will be performed on the surgical population.  
11.3.2.1  Primary Efficacy Analysis  
This study does not have a primary efficacy endpoint since the evaluation of efficacy is not a 
primary objective.  
11.3.2.2  Secondary Efficacy Analyses  
The AsBR  and ABR will be derived for each treatment interval assigned to the subject (7 days, 
10 days, 14 days, and 21 days), and will not include  the time either during or the first 3 months 
after the surgery substudy, the time during the SC substudy,  and subjects in Arm 4 .  Rates will 
be calculated as t he number of applicable bleeding episodes divided by the total duration the

CRD-TPL-077 Confidential  subject was assigned prophylaxis treatment for the given treatment interval .  Disjoint periods 
of observation with the same treatment interval  may be combined within a subject for those 
periods when the subject was treated for at least 3 months to insure stable treatment .  Duration 
of treatment for each period will begin when the subject receives the first dose of the assigned 
prophylaxis regime n.  ABRs will be summarized across subjects using descriptive statistics .  A 
crude rate will also be calculated for each treatment interval  along with an exact two -sided 
95% confidence interval under the assumption that counts follow a Poisson distribution  with 
common underlying intensity.  
AsBR and ABR are considered secondary endpoints in this study .  Other types of bleed ing 
episodes (eg, trauma tic) will be summarized in a similar manner as these secondary endpoints.  
A comparison of A sBR and ABR will be performed between 14 -day routine prophylactic 
treatment in this study compared with on -demand only treatment from Study CSL654_3001  
(Arm 2).  A Wilcoxon rank sum test will be performed on the matched -pairs at the two -sided 
0.05 level to test the hy pothesis that the median difference in rates differs from  zero.  
Descriptive statistics will also be provided .     
The analysis of AsBR will also be conducted with subjects from both Study CSL654_3001 and 
the present extension study to assess whether a similar treatment effect exists  between the 7 -
day prophylaxis regimen and the 14-day prophylaxis regimen .   
In order to demonstrate that a similar treatment effect also exists for the 14 -day prophylaxis 
regimen and 7 -day prophylaxis regimen, the  mean AsBR will be compared between the 
2 prophylaxis regimens to evaluate non -inferiority. Following the same clinically acceptable 
difference  used in the CSL654_3001 study, a non -inferiority margin of 6 spontaneous 
bleeds/year has been selected.   
The null and alternative hypotheses for the AsBR are as follows:  
H0:  µ7-day – µ14-day  -6 
H1:  µ7-day – µ14-day > -6

Amendment 6  03 February  2020 Page 110 of 187 
CRD-TPL-077 Confidential  To establish non -inferiority of the 14 -day regimen versus the 7 -day regimen  for the AsBR, the 
lower confidence limit of the 95% confidence inte rval, based on a one -sample (paired) 
t-distribution, for the difference between the two means  (7-day regimen - 14-day regimen)  must 
be greater than -6 spontaneous bleeds/year .   
The same analysis will be conducted  for the comparison of ABR. The clinical difference of 
6 total bleeds/year is selected when switching from 7 -day prophylaxis regimen to 14 -day 
prophylaxis regimen. Futhermore, the non -inferority analysis of AsBR and ABR between the 
extended regimen s (14-day or 10-day) and the 7-day regimen will be conducted in a similar 
manner. 
Similar comparisons of ABR and AsBR between treatment regimens will also be conducted 
for the subgroup of pediatric subjects.  
Multiple comparisons and multiplicity:  A fixed-sequence multiple testing procedure will be 
used to control the overall Type I error rate at the two -sided 0.05 level for the secondary 
efficacy analysis.  Specifically, the test between 14 -day prophylaxis regimen and On -demand 
will first be performed at the two -sided 0.05 level of significance. Only if the 14 -day regimen 
is found to be effective, will the 14 -day prophylaxis regimen be non -inferior to 7 -day 
prophylaxis regimen at pre -specified margin. Only if 14 -day prophylaxis regimen is 
demonstrated non -inferior to the 7-day regimen, will the extended prophylaxis regimen (10 -day 
or 14-day) be non -inferior to the 7-day regimen . 
Consumption of rIX -FP will be summarized with descriptive statistics according to treatment 
interval and overall .  No formal statistical inf erences will be performed on these summary 
measures.  Standardized yearly totals will be calculated for each subject by dividing the 
subject’s observed total by total duration (days/365.25 days per year); standardized monthly 
totals will be calculated by d ividing the yearly estimate by 12 .  Calculation of duration will 
begin on the date of  the first prophylactic injection  at the assigned treatment interval .  Periods 
when the subject is not receiving routine prophylaxis (surgery substudy , SC substudy ) or

CRD-TPL-077 Confidential  INTRODUCTION  
This substudy  of Study CSL654_3003  will examine the efficacy of rIX -FP in patients with 
hemophilia B who are undergoing non -emergency  major or minor  surgery.  Efficacy will be 
measured in both the intraoperative and postoperative periods .  In addition, safety endpoints, 
including antibodies against rIX -FP, inhibitors to FIX and other AEs throughout the duration 
of the study in all study subjects will be monitored .   
The substudy will be conducted in compliance with this study protocol, ICH GCP, and the 
applicable regulatory requirement(s).  
STUDY OBJECTIVES AND  ENDPOINTS

and control of bleeding in patients with severe hemophilia  B during surgical procedures.  
Primary Endpoint  
Investigator’s  (or surgeon’s) overall clinical assessment of hemostatic efficacy for surgical 
prophylaxis, based on a four point ordinal scale (excellent, good, moderate, poor  / none)    
Secondary Objective and Endpoints  
Secondary Objective  
The secondary objective of th e study is to evaluate the safety of rIX -FP during the 
intraoperative and postoperative periods.  
Secondary Endpoints  
The secondary endpoints of this surgery substudy are:  
 The frequency of AEs related to rIX -FP during the intraoperative and postoperative 
periods.   
 The occurrence of FIX inhibitors .   
 The occurrence of antibodies against rIX -FP.

Amendment 6  03 February  2020 Page 132 of 187 
CRD-TPL-077 Confidential   Comparison of predicted and intraoperative estimated blood loss.  
 Comparison of predicted and actual transfusion requirements.  
 Change in hemoglobin levels between ba seline, intraoperatively and postoperatively.  
STUDY DESIGN 
This is a prospective, open -label substudy to evaluate the efficacy and safety of rIX -FP to 
prevent bleeding during surgery in patients with congenital FIX deficiency (hemophilia B) .  
The study wil l consist of intraoperative and postoperative safety and efficacy evaluation 
periods with rIX -FP.  Subjects must meet all of the inclusion criteria of the main study and 
require non-emergency  major or minor surgery .  A major surgery is defined as a surgical 
procedure that involves anesthesia (general, spina l, epidural or regional block),  respiratory 
assistance , or requires hemostatic therapy for periods exceeding 5  consecutive days  
(including but not limited to orthopedic and cardiac surgery) .   
Approximately 3 hours before the non-emergency surgical procedure, the subject will receive 
a single bolus injection of rIX -FP in order to increase the plasma FIX activity level to either 
60% to 80%, or higher, as recommended by the WFH for major surgery , or higher if 
recommended by the guidelines of the local hospital / practice .  Additional bolus injections of 
rIX-FP may be administered  during a major surgery, if needed.  Blood samples for the 
determination of FIX levels will be collected before administratio n of additional doses of 
rIX-FP, if feasible .  During the postoperative period, defined as the start of wound closure, 
additional bolus injections of rIX -FP may be administered to maintain a required trough FIX 
activity level as recommended by the WFH, at the investigator’s discretion.  
Details of the surgical procedure are to be documented as outlined in Perioperative Prophylaxis 
for Surgeries .  Efficacy and safety data during and after surgery will be recorded, including 
time / dose of rIX-FP with documentation of total consumption, investigator’s assessments of 
blood loss and overall efficacy, transfusion requirements and AEs.

Amendment 6  03 February  2020 Page 133 of 187 
CRD-TPL-077 Confidential  Number of Subjects 
Any subjects requiring surgery during the course of the main study  (CSL654_3003)  will be 
enrolled in the surgery substudy, with a  combined  target enrollment of at least 5 subjects and 
10 major surgeries  across the lead -in studies and this study .   
Duration  
The substudy design includes a 1 to 14 day  (or longer, if needed)  active treatment period .  
Subjects will then return to the treatment plan of the main study  at Day 28  ± 7 days.  The 
duration of the active treatment period will depend on the type  of surgery and local standard .  
SELECTION OF SUBSTUD Y POPULATION  
To be eligible for the substudy, subjects must meet all eligibility criteria of the main study 
protocol and:  
 Must require non -emergency surgery.  
 Must provide written informed consent for sub study participation . 
ALLOCATION , DOSING AND ADMINISTRATION  
Dose and Dosing Rationale  
There will be 3 treatment periods in this substudy: preoperative, intraoperati ve and 
postoperative .  The dose of rIX -FP will be selected based on the subject’s PK data obtained 
during the lead -in study or this (CSL654_3003) study, including incremental recovery and 
clearance , and the recommendations of the WFH. 
The desired FIX increase (% or IU/dL), as recommended by the WFH (see Appendix 3 ) for the 
control of bleeding during surgery should be calculated based on an individual subject’s PK 
data using the following formula:  
Number 
of factor 
IX IU 
required 
(IU) = Body 
weight 
(kg) X Desired 
factor IX 
increase 
(% or 
IU/dL) X Reciprocal of 
observed 
recovery 
(IU/kg per 
IU/dL)

CRD-TPL-077 Confidential  Selection and Timing of Dose for Each Subject in the Substudy  
Preoperative treatment  
Approximately 3 hours before the start of the scheduled surgery, the subject will be 
administered  1 bolus injection of rIX -FP.  The dose of rIX -FP (50 to 100 IU/kg, or higher ) will 
be selected based on the sub ject’s individual PK parameters , in order to increase the FIX levels  
to 60% to 80% , or higher.   
Intraoperative treatment  
The subject may receive intraoperative doses of rIX -FP, depending on the FIX activity levels, 
type of surgery and local standard of care .  FIX activity levels should be measured before 
major surgery to ensure the trough FIX activity level is maintained at 60 % to 80% during 
major surgical procedures .  In the event of the need for repeat dosing during the surgery, the 
FIX activity level should be measured.  
Postoperative treatment  
The subject will receive p ostoperati ve injections of rIX -FP from 1 to 14 days  (or longer, if 
needed), depending on the FIX activity levels, type of surgery and as recommended by  the 
WFH.  FIX activity levels should be measured before repeat dosing .  Removal of sutures or 
drains is best carried out at the time of peak FIX activity level. 
CONCOMITANT THERAPY  
All drugs currently being taken by a subject after the screening visit , and which continue to 
be taken during the substudy, are regarded as concomitant therapy and must be documen ted 
in the eCRF.  Nonpharmacological intervention (eg, physical therapy or a minor surgical 
procedure performed outside of the surgical substudy) is also regarded as concomitant 
therapy and must be documented in the eCRF.

Procedures to be performed before and after minor surgery are provided i n the Schedule of 
Assessments: Surgery Substudy – Minor Surgery .  If, during the surgery,  unforeseen 
circumstances result in the procedure fitting the definition of a major  surgical procedure (ie, 
requires anesthesia,  respiratory assistance or hemostatic support for a perio d exceeding 
5 consecutive days ), the assessments detailed for major surgery  (Section A) should be 
completed.

Notes to the Schedule of Assessments  for Cohorts 1 and 2 :  
A: Subjects are considered to be in the main study until Day 1 of the substudy.  
B: Day 15 assessments, including administration of IV rIX -FP, may occur earlier if the LL FIX activity is ≤ 2 IU/dL. 
C: Vital signs include measurement of body weight.  Weight only measured Day 1 (prior to dose), Day 15 and Day 28.  
D: Blood PK samples are at predose and at 0.5, 3, 24, 48, 72, 120, 168, 240 and 336 hours after the start of SC administration; at predose and at 0.5 hours post IV administration  
and at End of Substudy (Day 28).  Samples will be tested by the central laboratory; however, the site may request to have additional  samples tested by the local laboratory (LL).    
If LL FIX activity is ≤ 2 IU/dL, at any time point,  subsequent time points may be o mitted and the IV dose may be administered.   If LL FIX activity is > 5 IU/dL at 336 h ours, 
up to 3 additional blood PK samples may be taken every 48 hours (384, 432, and 480 hours) until LL is < 5 IU/dL , and the IV dose delayed until completion of the additional 
PK sampling at the discretion of the investigator . 
E: A sample that tests positive for antibodies against rIX -FP will be retested to discriminate between plasma -derived FIX, recombinant FIX and albumin antibodies.  
F: Blood samples for activation of co agulation tests include D -dimer, TAT, and prothrombin F1+2 . 
G: SC rIX-FP should be administered at least 14 days after the previous IV rIX-FP administration (21 days if subject is on a 21 -day prophylaxis regimen).  
H: Intravenous administration of rIX -FP will oc cur after the Day 15 blood draws.

 INTRODUCTION  
Background  
This substudy of CSL654_3003 will evaluate the safety and PK of single and repeated 
subcutaneous ( SC) administration of rIX-FP in adults with severe hemophilia B (ie, FIX 
activity of ≤  2%) who are currently enrolled in the main CSL654_3003 study . Safety will be 
measured by the frequencies of  AEs, SAEs, investigator and subject assessments of local 
tolerability, and the incidence of inhibitors to rIX -FP. Pharmacokinetic endpoints will be 
measured based on FIX activity.  
Nonclinical Evaluation  
PK characteristics following SC administrati on of rIX-FP were assessed in h emophilia B 
mice, rabbits, pigs and cynomo lgus monkeys. SC administration of rIX -FP in all species was 
systemically and locally well tolerated.  Respective bioavailabilities following S C 
administration were 31 % to 50% (hemophilia B mice), 43 % to 55% (rabbits), 22% (pigs) and 
9.29% to 17% (cynomolg us monkeys). Fu rthermore, exposure values in h emophilia B mice, 
rabbits, and cynomolgus monkeys were higher than those of marketed human FIX products 
(BeneFIX® or Berinin® P). 
A single SC dose in hemophilia  B mice provided a clear hemostatic effect compare d to the 
control group , with a significant reduction in time to hemostasis and total blood loss.  Efficacy 
of SC rIX-FP treatment was also superior to BeneFIX® administered SC. Additional activated 
partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) measurement at the end of the study demonstrated a 
significant reduction of aPTT values versus saline controls as well as BeneFIX® treated mice.    
Tolerability of SC injection was investigated in t he rabbit.  A single SC injection of rIX -FP 
was tolerated with no observed in -life findings, and minor local findings in histopathology, 
potentially being volume dose -dependent.

Study Product:  rIX-FP 
 
Amendment 6  03 February  2020 Page 162 of 187 
CRD-TPL-077 Confidential  
 Collectively , the nonclinical data demonstrate that SC administration  of rIX-FP to various 
animal species was tolerated with only minor local findings in rabbits and resulted in 
adequate bioavailability leading to pharmacodynamically -relevant exposure levels.  
Potential Risks and Benefits  
Potential risks associated with SC administr ation of rIX-FP are expected to be similar to the 
IV route of administration,  and include the development of antibodies against FIX  (including 
neutralizing antibodies [inhibitors] ) and hypersensitivity reactions . The potential risks 
associated with treatme nt with rIX -FP and specifically with SC administration  are discussed 
in detail in Section 7.4 of the Investigator’s Brochure . 
The use of a FIX replacement product with an extended half -life could be significantly 
beneficial to those affected by hemophilia B.  SC administration of rIX -FP may allow rout ine 
prophylaxis treatment for h emophilia B patients without the need for IV injections.  This 
route of administration may be beneficial particularly for those patients who have poor 
venous access, and may elimi nate the need for an indwelling catheter.  
The associated benefit-risk assessment of the substudy is acceptable for subjects enrolled in 
the substudy.

STUDY DESIGN  
Study Design and Rationale  
This is an open -label, multicenter  substudy to assess the safety, tolerability, and PK following 
single and repeated  ascending SC doses of rIX-FP in hemophilia B subjects.   Subjects will be 
treated in 1  or more of the 4 planned, sequential dose cohorts . Note: Cohort 4 is optional  and 
will only be opened if the results of Cohorts 1 to 3  reveal that additional data on repeated SC 
dosing is required to inform the further clinical development .  Each cohort will enroll a 
minimum of 4 and a maximum of 6 subjects.   
 Cohort 1:  single SC dose of 25 IU/kg rIX-FP. 
 Cohort 2:  single SC dose of 50 IU/kg rIX-FP.

CRD-TPL-077 Confidential  
  Cohort 3:  repeated SC doses of 25 IU/kg rIX-FP every 3 days  (15 doses). 
 Cohort 4:  repeated SC doses of ≤ 50 IU/kg rIX-FP every 5 days (15 doses); actual 
dose to be used in this cohort will be determined by the Sponsor  based on PK results 
from Cohort 3. 
Male hemophilia B patients, ≥  18 years, currently enrolled in CSL654_3003, who have at 
least 100 EDs  (Cohorts 1 and 2) or 50 EDs (Cohort s 3 and 4) to rIX-FP and weigh ≥50 kg to 
≤ 100 kg will be eligible for the substudy.  
Up to 28 days prior to SC administration of rIX -FP, subjects will be screened to determine 
eligibility for the substudy.  Subjects will be sequentially assigned to a cohort  (Cohort 1, 2, 3 
or 4).  SC administration of rIX-FP will be performed  at least 14 days afte r the previous IV 
rIX-FP administration (21 days if subject is on a 21 -day prophylaxis regimen).   Blood 
samples for PK analysis will be collected at the time points detailed in the  Schedule of 
Assessments for Cohorts 1 and 2 ).   
In Cohorts 1 and 2, following collection of the last SC PK sample , a single IV dose of 
50 IU/kg rIX-FP will be administered .  If LL FIX activity is > 5 IU/dL at 336 h ours, up to 
3 additional PK blood samples may be taken every 48  hours (384, 432, and 480 hours) until 
LL is < 5 IU/dL, and the IV dose delayed until completion of the additional PK sampling at 
the discretion of the investigator .  Following IV administration of rIX -FP, blood samples for 
PK analysis will be collected at selected time  points (see Schedule of Assessme nts for 
Cohorts 1 and 2 ). Subjects will return in 2 weeks (Day 28) for an end of substudy visit to 
assess safety.  After the end of substudy visit on Day 28, subjects will return to their IV rIX -
FP regimen in the main study.   
After at least 4 subjects in Cohort 1 have reached Day 15, plasma exposure after SC 
administration (FIX activity levels) and safety , including inhibitor results,  will be reviewed 
by a Safety Review Committee  (SRC).  If no safety concerns are identified, dosing of Cohort 
2 may start.

 After at least 4 subjects in Cohort 2 have reached Day 15, plasma exposure after SC 
administration (FIX activity levels) and safety will be reviewed by an SRC. After review of 
the data, a decision will be made to enroll Cohort 3.   
In Cohorts 3 and 4, subjects will be sequentially assigned to SC doses of 25 IU/kg every 
3 days (Cohort 3)  or to SC doses of ≤ 50 IU/kg every 5 days (Cohort 4) , for a total of 1 5 SC 
doses in each cohort . rIX-FP will be administered SC at least 14 days afte r the previous IV 
rIX-FP administration  (21 days for subjects on a 21 -day IV regimen in the main study). 
Blood samples for PK analysis will be collected before the first SC dose , before selected 
SC doses administered at the study site , and for a serial PK profile after the first and the final 
SC doses. Doses 4 to 12 and Dose 14 will be administered by subjects/caregivers at home.  
Subjects will return 14 days after their final SC dose  for an end of substudy visit for 
collection of the final PK sample and for safety assessments .  After the end  of substudy visit , 
subjects will return to their IV rIX -FP regimen in the main study.  
After at least 4 subjects in Cohort 3 have completed  SC treatment , plasma exposure after SC 
administration (FIX activity levels) an d safety will be reviewed by the SRC.  
An overview of the SC substudy design  for Cohorts 3 and 4 is presented in  Figure 2.

EOS = end of substudy; PK = pharmacokinetic;  SC = subcutaneous . 
Notes:  
1. The 120-h sample after SC Dose 1 will only be taken in Cohort 4.  
2. Doses with an asterisk will be administered by the subject/caregiver at home. All other doses will be given at 
the study site.  
If a subject experiences a bleeding episode during the PK sampling period, the subject should 
treat the bleed with his standard on -demand IV dose of rIX -FP as prescribed in the main 
study.   
Dose and Dosing Regimen  
Each SC dose of rIX-FP will be administer ed in up to 4 injection sites, with a volume of up to 
4 mL per site.   
The starting dose will be 25 IU/kg  (as a single dose in Cohort 1 and as repeated doses in 
Cohort 3) , with dose escalation in Cohort 2 to 50 IU/kg (single dose) and to ≤ 50 IU/kg 
(repeated doses) in optional Cohort 4 .   
Planned Substudy Duration  
The maximum total substudy duration of each subject will be approximately 30 days  for 
subjects in Cohorts 1 and 2, approximately 57 days for subjects in Cohort 3 , and

 approximately  85 days for subjects in Cohort 4. Subjects will then return to the IV treatment 
plan of the main study.   
The overall substudy duration (ie, first subject’s Day 1 visit to the last subject’s end of 
substudy visit ) is expected to be 18 to 22 months and includes  estimated durations for 
screening, enrollment of the subjects into the substudy, and the final visit.   
Planned Number of Subjects  
This substudy will enroll approximately 4 to 6 male subjects  each in Cohorts 1 to 4 (ie, up to 
a maximum of 24 subjects). Subjects may enroll in more than 1 cohort.  
Study Monitoring Procedures  
Adverse events and local tolerability will be monitored for all subjects enrolled in the 
substudy, and AE reporting will be performed as described in the ma in protocol. After at least 
4 subjects in Cohort 1 have reached Day 15, SC exposure (FIX activity levels) and safety 
assessments will be reviewed by the SRC.  If no safety concer ns are identified, dosing of 
Cohort 2 may start.  The same procedure will be followed before a decision is made to enroll  
subjects in C ohorts 3 and 4.   
Enrollment into the substudy and further SC administration of rIX -FP will be halted for 
review by the SRC and recommendation for continuation if any of the following occurs:  
 One subject experiences anaphylaxis that is causally related to SC administration of 
rIX-FP. 
 One subject experiences a serious hypersensitivity event that is causally related to SC 
administration of rIX -FP. 
Cohorts 1 and 2 : The SRC will meet after a cohort has data available through Day 15 f or 4 
subjects and will review safety and SC exposure (FIX activity levels).  If no safety concerns 
are identified, the SRC will make a recommendation to continue to the next cohort.

ALLOCATION, DOSING A ND ADMINISTRATION  
Cohorts 1 and 2 
Subjects will be sequentially assigned to a cohort , and receive a single SC dose of rIX -FP.  
The SC dose of rIX -FP will be administered at up to 4 injection sites, a minimum of 2.5 cm 
apart, with a volume of up to 4 mL per site.  SC administration m ay occur on the stomach, 
thigh, or upper arm.  The SC rIX-FP dose should be administered at least 14 days after the 
previous rIX -FP administration (21 days if subject is on a 21 -day prophylaxis regimen).   At 
Day 15 (336 hours), subjects will be administere d a single IV dose of 50  IU/kg rIX -FP.   
If a subject experiences a bleeding episode during the PK sampling period (prior to Day 15), 
the subject should treat the bleed with his standard on -demand dose of rIX -FP as prescribed 
in the main study, dosed IV.  If LL FIX activity is ≤ 2 IU/dL, at any time  point, subsequent 
time points may be omitted and the IV dose may be administered .  If LL FIX activity is 
> 5 IU/dL at 336 h, up to 3 additional blood PK samples may be taken every 48  hours (384, 
432, and 480 hou rs) until LL is < 5 IU/dL , and the IV dose delayed until completion of the 
additional PK sampling at the discretion of the investigator .  If the treatment of a bleed occurs 
within 7 days of the Day 15 visit, the IV dose is optional.  A subject may be treat ed with an 
additional IV dose of rIX-FP as long as the dose is given within the  visit window.  
Cohorts 3 and 4 
Subjects will be sequentially assigned to a cohort , and receive repeated SC doses of rIX -FP 
for a total of 15 doses. Each SC dose of rIX -FP will be administered at up to 4 injection sites, 
a minimum of 2.5 cm apart, with a volume of up to 4 mL per site. SC administration may 
occur on the stomach, thigh , or upper arm. The first SC rIX-FP dose should be administered

 at least 14 days after the previous rIX -FP administration (21 days if subject is on a 21 -day 
prophylaxis regimen).  The subject will return to their  regular IV treatment schedule in the 
main study once they have completed the end  of substudy visit 14 days after the final SC 
dose. 
If a subject experiences a bleeding episode during the PK sampling period, the subject should 
treat the bleeding episode with his standard on -demand IV dose of rIX -FP as prescribed in 
the main study. The subject should continue in the SC substudy following the same schedule 
of SC injections, regardless of the IV treatment of that bleeding episode.

Pharmacokinetic Analyses 
Pharmacokinetic Evaluation of rIX-FP 
Cohorts 1 and 2: 
If during the PK assessment peri od, a subject experiences a ble eding episode, no further 
blood samples will be taken as part of PK assessment, regardles s of whether the bleeding 
episode is treated or not.  The  PK may or may not need to be re peated.   
If LL FIX activity is ≤ 2 IU/dL , at any time point, subsequent time points may be omitted and 
the IV dose may be administered.

 If LL FIX activity is > 5 IU/dL at 336 hours, up to 3 additiona l blood PK samples may be 
taken every 48 hours (384, 432, and 480 hours) until LL is < 5 IU/dL, and the IV dose 
delayed until completion of the a dditional PK sampling at the d iscretion of the investigator. 
Cohorts 3 and 4:  
If a subject experiences a bleed ing episode during the PK asses sment period, the subject 
should treat the bleeding epis ode with his standard on-demand I V dose of rIX-FP as 
prescribed in the main study. The  subject should continue in th e SC substudy following the 
same schedule of SC injections, regardless of the IV treatment of that bleeding episode. All 
PK sampling should be completed as outlined in the Schedule of Assessments for the SC 
substudy. See section “Substudy Pharmacokinetic Population” for  details on the PK inclusion 
of these subjects. 
Overview of Variables 
The SC PK of rIX-FP and the subject’s previous FIX product will  be assessed on the basis of 
measurements of FIX activity levels in plasma.  PK samples will  be used to measure the 
following PK parameters: 
Cohorts 1 and 2:  
 Cmax 
 Incremental recovery (the pea k level recorded 30 minutes after injection and reported as 
[IU/mL]/[IU/kg]) 
 Terminal elimination half-life (t 1/2) 
 Area under the concentration-time curve  (AUC0-last) 
 Clearance 
 Volume of distributi on at steady state (V ss) 
 Tmax 
Cohorts 3 and 4:  
 Cmax after first dose (C max, Dose 1) and C max at steady state after final SC dose (C max,ss)

Methods of Assessment 
Blood samples for determination of FIX activity will be obtaine d before and after SC 
injection of rIX-FP at the time points detailed in the Schedule of Assessments for the SC 
substudy. 
A zero-time will be assigned as th e start of the injection, and  the residual FIX at the predose 
time point will be used as the baseline value for each administ ration.  FIX activity will be 
measured at a central laborator y using a validated one-stage cl otting method. 
Details regarding sample collection, handling, deep freezing of  samples and shipment to the 
central laboratory are given in the  Laboratory Manual in the In vestigator Site File.

 Local Tolerability Assessments  
Investigator  assessment:  For the SC injections administered at the study site (Doses 1, 2, 3, 
13, and 15), the investigator will perform assessments of local tolerability at the SC injection 
site(s). If several injection sites are used, each site will be judged but only the site with the 
strongest reaction will be recorded, according to the following scale:  
Erythema 
Description  Score 
None 0 
Very slight (barely perceptible)  1 
Well-defined 2 
Moderate to severe  3 
Severe (beet redness) to slight eschar formations (injuries in depth)  4 
 
Edema or Induration  
The size of any edema or induration will be determined  by measuring the smallest and largest 
diameters.  
Itching, Local Pain, or Local Heat  
The severity of any local reactions of itching, local pain, or local heat will be assessed based 
on the following classification: none (0), very slight (1), slight (2), mo derate (3), and severe 
(4).  
The investigator will perform l ocal tolerability assessments at the time  points detailed in the 
Cohort 3 Sampling Schedule  and the Cohort 4 Sampling Schedule . 
Subject assessment:  The subject (or caregiver) will assess l ocal tolerability at the SC injection 
site during SC administration at home . Subjects will record in the eDiary their judgment on 
the overall perception of the local reactions on a scale of none (0), very slight (1), slight (2), 
moderate (3), and severe (4) approx imately 30 minutes, 8 hours, and 24 hours after the end of 
each SC dose  given at home . If several injection sites are used, each site will be judged  but

 only the site with the strongest reaction will be recorded. The investigator will review these 
eDiary data at the next visit and will record local reactions as AEs.  
Note: If a local reaction AE is reported, it also needs to be included in local tolera bility 
assessment (by subject and  / or investigator) to ensure consistency of reporting between AEs 
and local tolerability assessment s. 
Other Assessments  
Markers of Activation of Coagulation  
Activation  of coagulation tests, including prothrombin fragment 1 +2, thrombin -antithrombin 
and D-dimer, will be assessed by the central laboratory at the time  points detailed  in the 
Cohort 3 Sampling Schedule  and the Cohort 4 Sampling Schedule .  
STATISTICS  
Sample Size Estimation  
Sample size for this substudy is based up on empirical considerations and no formal sample 
size calculation will be performed.   A maximum of up to  24 subjects will be recruited into the 
substudy.  If a subject drops out prior to Day 1, the subject may be replaced.  
Description of Analysis D atasets 
Substudy Safety Population  
The safety population will consist of all subjects who received at least 1 SC dose of rIX -FP in 
this substudy.  All safety analyses will be performed on the safety population.  
Substudy Pharmacokinetic Population  
The PK population  will comprise subjects who have received at least 1 dose of rIX -FP 
administered SC and have blood samples drawn for PK assessment. Subjects will be excluded 
from analysis if an insufficient number of analyzable PK samples were obtained to permit the

include AEs, vital signs, physical examination, investigator’s and subject’s assessments of 
local tolerability, neutralizing antibodies against F IX, antibodies against  rIX-FP and CHO 
cells, and markers of activation of coagulation (prothrombin fragment 1+2, TAT, and D -
dimer).  (See Section 11.3.3 of the main protocol .) 
Substudy Pharmacokinetics Data  
A noncompartmental analysis will be performed to allow individual PK data analysis.  
Noncompartmental PK analysis will be performed for FIX ac tivity in plasma, and PK 
parameters will be listed and summarized by treatment group. Individual subject and subgroup 
mean plasma concentration -time data will be plotted for each treatment group on linear and 
semi-logarithmic scales.  
Population PK methodol ogy will be applied for derivation of some of PK parameters, 
including calculation of bioavailability. Prior rIX -FP IV PK data (from 
Studies CSL654_2001, CSL654_2004, CSL654_3001, CSL654_3002, and / or 
CSL654_3003) will be utilized for Population PK modeli ng purposes  that will be 
documented separately .

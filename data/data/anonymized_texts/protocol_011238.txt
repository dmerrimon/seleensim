Why am I being asked to volunteer? 
 
You are being invited to participate in a research study being conducted by Dr. 
Rebecca Hamm and Dr. Sindhu Srinivas, who are obstetricians at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania. You are being invited to participate
 because you 
delivered a baby during this admission and your doctor has recommended that you have a blood transfusion. This means receiving blood that was donated by other people. Your participation is voluntary which means you can choose whether or not you want to participate. If you choose not to participate, there will be no loss of benefits to which you are otherwise entitled. Before you can make your decision, you will need to know what the study is about, the poss ible risks 
and benefits of being in this study, and what you will have to do in this study. The research team is going to talk to you about the research study, and they will give you this consent form to read. You may also decide to discuss it with your family, friends, or family doctor. You may find some of the medical language difficult to understand. Please ask the study doctor and/or the research team about this form. If you decide to participate, you will be asked to sign this form.    What is the purpose of this research study?

 Blood transfusion is often recommended for women who have anemia (low blood 
counts) after delivering a baby. Currently, many doctors give 2 units, or packets, of blood because they expect that everyone will need 2. However, it may be better to only give 1 unit at a time to raise blood counts and relieve the symptoms of anemia, such as dizziness or feeling tired. The purpose of this study is to help us understand whether giving only 1 unit of blood at a time can reduce the total number of units of blood needed to raise low blood counts after delivery.  
The study will compare the effects of giving 1 unit or 2 units of blood at a time.   If 
you decide to participate, you will be in one of two groups – a group receiving 1 
unit at a ti me or a group receiving 2 units at a time.  
 We are  asking women to volunteer for the study if they are at least 18 years of 
age, they have delivered a baby , and have been recommended to receive a 
blood transfusion at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania.    How long will I be in the study? How many other people will be in the study?  
 
You will participate in the study from today until a postpartum visit that will be 
scheduled 4 to 9 weeks from now.  The study is expected to enroll 66 women 
and to take appr oximately 2 years.  All participants  will be from the Hospital of 
the University of Pennsylvania.  
 What am I being asked to do? 
 
You are being asked to come back for a visit at 4 to 9 weeks after your delivery. 
This is recommended as standard of care for all postpartum patients. At this visit, we will ask you to complete three questionnaires about your mood, your relationship with your baby, and how tired you feel. We will also ask you about 
breastfeeding. The additional time needed for the study at this visit is about 20 minutes beyond the time needed for a usual postpartum visit.      
 You are being asked to allow us to gather information about your pregnancy and 
delivery by reviewing our computerized charting system.  We will also review the 
records from your current hospital stay and any other hospital stay between now and your scheduled postpartum visit.   You are being asked to allow us to randomly as sign you, like flipping a coin, to 
one of the two groups described below .  Neither you nor the doctors working on 
the study will have any control over your group assignment.   
 The two groups are:  
 
1. Single -unit blood transfusion, or 1 unit at a time. This m eans your doctor 
will order 1 unit of blood and your nurse will give you that blood through your intravenous (IV) line.

 2. Multiple -unit blood transfusion, or 2 units at a time. This means your 
doctor will order 2 units of blood and your nurse will give you that blood 
through your IV line.  
 
For both groups, a nurse will draw a blood sample 4 to 6 hours after the 
transfusion to look at your blood count. After the results come back, your doctor 
will see you, talk to you about the results, how you are feeling,  and do a physical 
exam  to help decide whether or not you need more blood. This exam and repeat 
blood count would be done with blood transfusions outside of the study as our standard of care.  If your providers determine you need more blood after the first 
transfusion,  you will be given additional units one at a time at the discretion of 
your provider.  
   What are the possible risks or discomforts?  
 
Blood transfusion presents a risk of allergic reaction and infection. The study 
itself will not increase the risk .  There will not be an increase in the number of 
exams or the number of blood draws if you participate in the study.    Questionnaires can sometimes make people feel embarrassed or uncomfortable. You may choose not to answer questions that make you uncomfortable.  
 There is also a risk of loss of confidentiality. However, all of our staff are well trained in protecting information about you and your baby and will take precautions to reduce the likelihood of this risk.  
 If you are randomized to the single- unit transfusion group, it is possible you will 
still need 2 units of blood, but over a longer period of time. This may lead to an extra night in the hospital.  In addition, it may take more than one unit for your 
sympto ms to improve. Finally, each unit of blood you are exposed to may 
increase the risk of developing an allergic reaction or antibodies against blood products.  
 Currently, both methods of blood transfusion are used at Penn; however, the 
method your own doctor would use is a matter of choice because  there are no 
clear benefits to one method over another; physicians will use whichever method 
they prefer and feel is most appropriate for the patient.    What if new information becomes available about the study?  
 
During the course of this study, we may find more information that could be 
important to you.  This includes information that, once learned, might cause you to change your mind about being in the study.  We will notify you as soon as possible if such infor mation becomes available.  However, based upon the nature 
of this study, we do not anticipate that this will happen.

What are the possible benefits of the study?  
 
Receiving 1 unit of blood at a time might decrease the number of transfusions 
that you get and therefore might decrease your risk of an allergic reaction or an infection from blood. Receiving 2 units of blood at a time might help you feel 
better more quickly. However, this may not be the case.  Participation in this 
study is for research purposes , and no health benefit is guaranteed for you. The 
results of this study could benefit future patients.  
 What other choices do I have if I do not participate?  
 
You may choose not to participate in this study without affecting your present or 
future care at the University of Pennsylvania Health System. Your alternative to providing your consent is to not participate in this study . In that cas e you would 
still get a blood transfusion, with either 1 or 2 units being chosen at the discretion of your doctor. Bo th methods of blood transfusion being used in this study are 
also used routinely in clinical care.  
 Will I be paid for being in this study?  
 
You will be paid $25 at the time of your discharge from this hospitalization and 
$25 at your postpartum visit after  you complete the 3 surveys  in the form of VISA 
gift cards .  
 
Will I have to pay for anything?  
 
You or  your insurance will have to pay for any routine medical care that you 
receive, including all costs related to your labor and delivery, postpartum care, 
and blood transfusion because you would receive this care regardless of 
participation in the study.  Y ou will not be billed anything extra for your 
participation in this study.  
  What happens if I am injured from being in the study?  
 
We will offer you the  care needed to treat injuries directly resulting from taking 
part in this research.  We may bill your insurance company or other third parties, if appropriate, for the costs of the care you get for the injury, but you may also be responsible for some of t hem.  
 There are no plans for the University of Pennsylvania to pay you or give you other compensation for the injury.  You do not give up your legal rights by signing this form.    If you think you have been injured as a result of taking part in this research study, tell the person in charge of the research study as soon as possible.  The researcher’s name and phone number are listed on page 1 of this  consent form.

 When is the study over?  Can I leave the study before it ends?  
 
This study is expected to end after all participants have been recruited and all information has been collected. The study is expected to take four years.  This 
study may also be stopped at any time by your physician, the University of Pennsylvania, or the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology without your consent because:  
• The Primary Investigator feels it is necessary for your health or safety.  Such an action would not require your consent, but you will be informed if such a decision is made and the reason for this decision.  
• You have not followed study instructions.  
• The study Principal Investigator, or the Department of Obstetrics and 
Gynecology has decided to stop the study.  
If you decide to participate, you are free to leave the study at any  time.  
Withdrawal will not interfere with your future care.   
 Who can see or use my information?  How will my personal information be protected?    
 
We will do our best to make sure that the personal information obtained during 
the course of this research study will be kept private.  However, we cannot guarantee total privacy.  Your personal information may be given out if required by law.  If information from this study is published or presented at scientific meetings, your name and other personal information will not be used.   
 Your information will be held in a research database on a password protected computer in a locked office in the Department of Maternal Fetal Medicine. Only the principal investigator or study staff will have access to these files .  
 Electronic Medical Records and Research Results  
 What is an Electronic Medical Record?  
 
What is an Electronic Medical Record and/or a Clinical Trial Management  
System?  
 An Electronic Medical Record (EMR) is an electronic version of the record of your care within a health system. An EMR is simply a computerized version of a paper medical rec ord.  
 A clinical trial management system (CTMS) is used to register your information 
as a participant in a study and to allow for your research data to be 
entered/stored for the purposes of data analysis and any other required activity for the purpose of the conduct of the research.  
 If you are receiving care or have received care within the University of Pennsylvania Health System (UPHS) (outpatient or inpatient) and are

 participating in a University of Pennsylvania research study,  information related 
to your participation in the research (i.e. laboratory tests, imaging studies and 
clinical procedures) may be placed in your existing EMR maintained by UPHS. Information related to your participation in clinical research will also be contained in the CTMS.  
 If you have never received care within UPHS and are participating in a University of Pennsylvania research study that uses UPHS services, an EMR will be created for you for the purpose of maintaining any information produced from your participation in this research study.  The creation of this EMR is required for your participation in this study. In order to create your EMR, the study team will need to obtain basic information about you that would be similar to the information you would provide the first time you visit a hospital or medical facility (i.e. your name, the name of your primary doctor, the type of insurance you have). Information related to your participation in the study (i.e. laboratory tests, imaging studies and clinical procedures) may be placed in this EMR.  Once placed in your EMR or in the CTMS, your information may be accessible to appropriate UPHS workforce members that are not part of the research team.  Information within your EMR may also be shared with others who are determined by UPHS to be appropriate to have access to your EMR (e.g. health insurance 
company, disability provider, etc.).  
 
What information about me may be collected, used or shared with others?  
 
The following personal health information will be collected and used for research but will NOT be disclosed during your involvement with this research study:   
• Name, date of birth, medical 
record number  
• Personal medical and obstetric 
history  
• Information from your medical 
records regarding your labor and delivery  
 • Information from physical examination  
• Results of tests and procedures you 
will undergo during this research study as described in the informed consent form.  
• Your telephone number in order to 
contact you to schedule the end of study postpartum visit.  
Why  is my information being used?  
 Your information and results of tests and procedures are used to:  
• do the research  
• oversee the research to see if the research was done right.  
 We will not contact you after your postpartum visit.

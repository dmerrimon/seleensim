Number of Study 
Sites  Approximately 100 global sites will participate in this study.  
Number of Subjects 
Planned  Approximately 750 male and female adult and elderly subjects    
Test Product, Dose, 
and Administration  Pimavanserin 20 mg is provided as 2×10 mg tablets and 
pimavanserin 34 mg is provided as 2×17 mg tablets . It is 
recommended that the subject take the study drug at approximately the same time ea ch day. Tablets will be administered orally as a 
single dose once daily. 
Study Design  This study will be a 52 -week open -label extension study to evaluate 
the long- term safety and tolerability of pimavanserin in adult and 
elderly subjects  with neuropsychia tric symptoms related to 
neurodegenerative disease. 
The study will have two periods ( Figure S–1): 
• Open -label treatment period (52 weeks) 
• Safety follow-up (30 [+4] days) 
 
Treatment Period (Baseline through Week 52)  
Eligible subjects will begin pimavanserin once-daily dosing at 34 mg. 
Dose adjustments of pimavanserin down to 20 mg and up to 34 mg 
are permitted at any study visit (scheduled or unscheduled) after Baseline based on Investigator assessment of clinical res ponse. 
During the Treatment period, clinic visits will be conducted at Baseline and Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 28, 40, and 52 (end of treatment [EOT]), or upon early termination (ET) from the study. 
Study drug will be dispensed to the subject to take home at t he 
Baseline visit. The subject and study partner/caregiver will be 
provided instructions to take the first dose of study drug on the day after the Baseline visit .   
All concomitant permitted medications should  remain stable during 
the study but can be adjusted or discontinued, if clinically appropriate. These changes should be discussed with the Medical Monitor or designee as appropriate.

Safety Follow- up Period ( 30 Days) 
A safety follow- up telephone call  to the subject and study 
partner/caregiver  should be conducted 30 (+4) d ays after the last 
dose of study drug. 
The schedule of assessments is provided in Table S –1. 
Planned Duration of 
Treatment  The duration of participation for individual study subjects will be 
up to approximately 56 weeks.  
Each subject will participate in a 52 -week treatment period 
followed by a safety follow-up period of 30 (+4) days. The end of 
the clinical study will be when the last subject completes the last scheduled assessment (i.e., safety follow up). 
The total duration of exposure to pimavanserin may be greater than 
52 weeks as subjects may have been treated  with pimavanserin in a 
previous study.

This document is a research protocol and the described study will be conducted in 
compliance with the protocol and the International Council for Harmonis ation (ICH) 
Good Clinical Practice  (GCP) Guideline. 
1.1 Backg round Information 
Neuropsychiatric symptoms, including behavioral symptoms, such as hallucinations, delusions, irritability, apathy and agitation, are common in patients with neurodegenerative 
disease. Almost all individuals with dementia exhibit neuropsyc hiatric  symptoms over the 
course of the disease ( Steinberg et al. 2008; Lanctot et al. 2017), causing distress for the 
patient and their caregivers, as they are “ associated with impairment in activities of daily 
living, poor quality of life, earlier instit utionalization, accelerated disease progression, 
increased mortality, caregiver stress, and increased cost of care” (Lanctot et al. 2017). Psychosis, apathy, agitation, depression and sleep disturbances are common neuropsychiatric symptoms associated with Alzheimer’s disease. The emergence of neuropsychiatric 
symptoms typically occurs in three phases: “(1) irritability, depression, and nighttime behavior changes; (2) anxiety, appetite changes, agitation, and apathy; and (3) elation, motor disturbances, hallucinations, delusions, and disinhibition” ( Masters et al. 2015 ). 
Psychosis is a common neuropsychiatric symptom in patients with neurode generative 
diseases, particularly in patients with dementia associated with neurodegenerative disease. Psychotic symptom s are typical of dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), very common in 
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and occur, although to a lesser degree, in vas cular dementia (VaD) 
and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) ( Table 1–1 ). In one study, 67% of patients  with dementia  
had psychotic symptoms ( Ballard et al. 1995). It is also a frequent complication of 
Parkinson’s disease patients, with or without dementia. The psychosis in neurodegenerative diseases is typically dominated by visual hallucinations, with delusions often consisting of 
the reactions or rationaliz ations that follow. However, delusions do occur as distinct 
phenomena, often taking the form of misinterpretations of real or imaginary objects, 
delusions of infidelity or abandonment, or beliefs such as thinking that spouses or relatives are duplicates of  the original person. Among AD patients, delusions are more common than 
hallucinations ( Fischer et al. 2016; Ballard  et al. 1995) while hallucinations are more 
common in patients with  DLB and Parkinson’s disease dementia. Patients with psychosis 
who had a clinical diagnosis of AD are often found on autopsy to have Lewy bodies or vascular lesions ( Fischer et al. 2016; Kim  et al. 2017).

Source: Adapted from Jellinger ( 2012) 
There is evidence that psychotic features in Parkinson’s disease, AD, and DLB are associated 
with polymorphisms in the serotonergic pathway genes, in particular the 5HTTLPR polymorphism in SLA6A4, which codes for the serotonin transporter ( Sweet et  al. 2001; 
Quaranta et  al. 2009;  DeMichele-Sweet and Sweet 2010;  Creese et  al. 2014 ). This 
observation raises the possibility that there is a common biological link among those dementia patients who have psychotic features, regardless of subtype, and provides mechanistic support for the finding that pimavanserin, a compound with serotonergic but not 
dopaminergic activity, can have an effect on delusions and hallucinations. 
Treatment of neuropsychiatric symptoms associated with neurodegenerative disease 
represents an area of high u nmet need. There are no approved therapies for psychosis 
associated with DLB or AD . A substantial number of these patients receive off- label 
antipsychotic drug treatment to control their symptoms. However, many of these drugs have not demonstrated efficacy in controlled trials, worsen patients’ motor symptoms, require extensive monitoring, or have other safety concerns. The lack of target engagement in a 
degenerating brain may limit the effectiveness of currently approved treatment s, such as 
antidepressants  and antipsychotics , for mood and psychotic symptoms ( Lanctot  et al.  2017). 
The CATIE-AD study concluded that the adverse effects of risperidone, olanzapine, and quetiapine limited their overall effectiveness ( Schneider et al. 200 6). 
Limited options are av ailable for the treatment of neuropsychiatric symptoms in 
neurodegenerative disease. While atypical antipsychotics are sometimes used in clinical practice, none are approved in the United States (US) for this use, with the exception of pimavanserin which is approved for the treatment of hallucinations and delusions associated 
with Parkinson’s disease psychosis (PDP). In Europe, atypical antipsychotics are generally 
Study: ACP -103-047  Final Version: 1.0  
Protocol Amendment 4  Date: 5 March  2021 
 Confidential and Proprietary Information of Acadia Pharmaceuticals Inc. Page 23 of 62 not approved in this population based on their equivocal efficacy and poor benefit- risk 
asses sment, particularly in elderly patients with dementia. In severe cases, limited indications 
exist for some antipsychotics; however, they are restricted to short- term treatment in patients 
with severe and persistent symptoms when non- pharmacological treatme nts have failed, and 
when there is risk of harm to self or others. For example, risperidone is approved in Canada 
and Europe for short- term treatment of persistent aggression in moderate to severe 
Alzheimer’s disease unresponsive to non-pharmacological approaches and when there is a risk of harm to self or others .  
Robust efficacy with pimavanserin was demonstrated without worsening the motor symptoms of Parkinson’s disease. In addition, a recently completed Phase 2 study 
(ACP -103-019) in AD psychosis reported statistical superiority of pimavanserin over placebo 
on the primary efficacy endpoint of improvement in psychotic symptoms at Week 6 of 
treatment  (Ballard et al. 2018). With its highly targeted and selective receptor binding profile, 
pimavanserin represents a new pharmacologic paradigm to treat psychotic symptoms across 
neurodegenerative diseases.  
1.2 Investigational Product 
Pimavanserin is an atypical antipsychotic that is present in the investigational product as  
pimavanserin tartrate salt with  the chemical name, urea, N -[(4-fluorophenyl)methyl]- N-(1-
methyl-4-piperidinyl)- N’-[[4-(2-methylpropoxy)phenyl]methyl]- ,(2R,3R)-2,3-
dihydroxybutanedioate (2:1). In April 2016, pimavanserin was approved in the United States 
for the t reatment of hallucinations and delusions associated with PDP . 
Pimavanserin is a novel small molecule designed to specifically block serotoninergic neurotransmission mediated by the 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin) 2A (5- HT
2A) receptor. 
At higher doses pimavanserin may block 5- HT 2C receptors ( Vanover et al. 2006). 
Pimavanserin  shows no appreciable activity at dopaminergic, adrenergic, histaminergic, or 
muscarinic receptors. Activity at these receptors has been implicated in a range of dose- limiting side effects associated with existing antipsy chotic drugs including cognitive 
dulling ( Saeedi et al. 2006 ; Mehta et al. 2004; Peretti  et al. 1997) and an increased risk of 
mortality in elderly patients with dementia ( Wang  et al. 2005). On the basis of its novel 
receptor binding profile, pimavanserin may have benefits with regard to overall tolerability relative to other antipsychotic agents. 
1.3 Previous Clinical Experience  
Pimavanserin is an atypical antipsychotic that is approved for the treatment of hallucinations 
and delusions associated with PDP. Studies have also been conducted in AD psychosis, 
Study: ACP -103-047  Final Version: 1.0  
Protocol Amendment 4  Date: 5 March  2021 
 Confidential and Proprietary Information of Acadia Pharmaceuticals Inc. Page 24 of 62 schizophrenia, and major depressive disorder . A more complete discussion of these studies, as 
well as the schizophrenia program, is available in the Investigator ’s brochure.  
1.4 Study Rationale 
Pimavanserin is the  only atypical antipsychotic approved in the US for the treatment of 
hallucinations and delusions associated with PDP. The safety database supporting the PDP 
development program consisted of >1200 patients and healthy subjects, including >600 PDP 
patients , representing the largest development program in PDP ever conducted. Pimavanserin 
has demonstrated a substantial improvement on measures of psychotic symptoms in patients 
with dementia -related psychosis in two clinical studies. In addition, pimavanserin ha s a 
selective pharmacology and distinct safety profile compared with other antipsychotics, 
including no detrimental effects on cognitive and motor symptoms and lack of off- target 
toxicities. This safety profile offers  the potentially unique and significant advantages over 
currently used antipsychotics in patients with neuropsychiatric symptoms associated with 
neurodegenerative disease.  
ACP -103-047 will further expand the safety database in adult and frail, elderly patients. It 
will enroll patients with prominent neuropsychiatric symptoms (e.g., delusions, hallucination, depression/dysphoria, apathy/indifference, disinhibition, irritability/lability, sleep disorder) associated with Parkinson’s disease and other neurodege nerative diseases , for whom there are 
no approved antipsychotic therapies.

3 STUDY DESCRIPTION 
3.1 Overview of Study Design 
This Phase 3b study will be conducted as a 52- week , open- label  extension safety study to 
evaluate the long- term safety and tolerability of pimavanserin in adult and el derly subjects  
with neuropsychiatric symptoms related to neurodegenerative disease. The total duration of 
exposure to pimavanserin may be greater than 52 weeks as subjects may have been treated 
with pimavanserin in a previous study. The duration of participation for individual study subjects will be up to approximately 56 weeks. The end of the clinical study will be when the 
last subject completes the last scheduled assessment (i.e., safety follow up) . 
Approximately 100 global sites will participate in this  study. 
Subject and study partner/caregiver consent for the present study must be  obtained  prior to 
the final procedures being performed at the antecedent study’s end of treatment ( EOT) visit 
or early termination (ET)  visit (if the study was ended  early by  the Sponsor). Data from the 
EOT/ET procedures of the antecedent study will be carried over to the ACP -103-047 study to

Protocol Amendment 4  Date: 5 March  2021 
 Confidential and Proprietary Information of Acadia Pharmaceuticals Inc. Page 26 of 62 be included as baseline information for the present study and this visit will be considered 
Baseline (Visit 1).  
The study will have two  periods ( Figure S–1): 
• Open -label treatment period (52 weeks) 
• Safety follow-up (30 [+4] days) 
3.1.1 Open -label Treatment  Period  (52 Weeks) 
Eligible subjects will begin pimavanserin once-daily dosing at 34 mg. 
Dose adjustments of pimavanserin down to 20 mg and up to 34 mg are permitted at any study 
visit (scheduled or unscheduled) after Baseline based on Investigator assessment of clinical response. 
During the Treatment period, clinic visits will be conducted at Baseline an d Weeks 2, 4, 8, 
12, 16, 28, 40, and 52 (EOT), or upon early termination from the study. Study drug will be dispensed to the subject to take home at the Baseline visit. The subject and 
study partner/caregiver will be provided instructions to ta ke the first  dose of study drug on 
the day after the Baseline visit .   
All concomitant permitted medications should remain stable during the study but can be adjusted or discontinued, if clinically appropriate.  These changes should be discussed with 
the Medical Monito r or designee as appropriate.  
3.1.2 Safety Follow- up Period  (30 Days) 
A safety follow-up telephone call to  the subject and study partner/caregiver should be 
conducted 30 (+4) days after the last dose of study drug.

• Subject ( or LAR ) withdraws consent 
• Other  
If at any time the C -SSRS or GCAS results for a given subject reveal potential suicidality, 
then the Investigator should assess the clinical significance of such res ults. If a clinically 
significant risk of suicidality is identified for a subject, then the Investigator should 
discontinue the subject and implement appropriate treatment ( Section 6.3.5).   
4.4.1 Handling of Subject W ithdrawal or Termination 
Every  reasonable effort should be made to complete Visit 9/ET  and the safety follow-up 
period if  a subject discontinues prematurely from the study for any reason. 
If a subject is lost to follow -up, every reasonable effort should be made to phone the subject 
and study partner/caregiver approximately 4 weeks  after last known contact with the subject 
in order to assess the subject’s current status . All phone contact with the subject and study 
partner/caregiver should be documented. 
For subjects who continue to be followed for safety, serious adverse events ( SAEs ) should 
continue to be reported as described in Section 7.5.2. 
If a subject is discontinued from the study because of an AE, every reasonable attempt should 
be made to follow the subject until the AE resolves or until the Investigator deems the AE to be chronic or stable.  
All SAEs will continue to be followed until su ch events have resolved or the Investigator 
deems them to be chronic or stable.  
Should a subject request or decide to withdraw, every reasonable effort should be made to complete and report observations as thoroughly as possible up to the date of withdrawal, including t he evaluations specified at the ET  visit outlined in  Table S –1. Unless the subject 
has withdrawn consent to be contacted for this study, every reasonable effort  should be made 
to complete the 30- day safety follow-up telephone call for all subjects who withdraw 
prematurely . All information will be reported  on the applicable pages of the eCRF . 
The Sponsor reserves the right to discontinue the study at any time for any reason. Such reasons may be any of, but not limited to, the following: 
• Occurrence of AEs unknown to date in respect of their nature, severity, and duration 
or the unexpected incidence of known AEs 
• Medical,  ethical , or business reasons affecting the continued performance of the study

for any reason. 
4.5 Prior and Concomitant Therapy 
4.5.1 Prior Medications  
Prior medications are defined as any medication taken before the date of the first dose of 
study drug. 
4.5.2 Concomitant Medications 
Concomitant medications are defined as any medication  taken on or after the date of the first 
dose of study drug.  
In order to ensure that appropriate concomitant therapy is administered, it is essential that 
subjects be instructed not to take any medication without prior consultation with the 
Inves tigator (unless the subject is receiving treatment for a medical emergency).  
4.5.2.1 Permitted, Restricted, and Prohibited Medications  
Prohibitions and restrictions for concomitant medications should be followed between the 
initial Baseline visit and Visit 9/ET as  specified in Appendix A  and Appendix B . These 
appendices do not constitute an exhaustive list and any questions regarding prohibited and 
restricted medications should be discussed with the Medical Monitor or designee. 
Use of medic ations that could interfere with study conduct or any questions regarding 
prohibited and restricted concomitant medications should be reviewed and/or discussed with 
the Medical Monitor or des ignee.  
Medications that can prolong QT interval are prohibited (or restricted if approved by the 
Medical Monitor) as specified in Appendix A . 
If a subject is on a medication restricted by the protocol, the medication should be adjusted if 
it is determined by the Investigator to be clinically appropriate (e.g., if the subject's symptoms are not well-controlled or if the subject cannot tolerate the current medication) in 
consultation with the treating physician. 
The Investigator may prescribe, adjust, or discontinue appropriate medication to treat or 
manage AEs.  Subjects who require  current treatment with a prohibited medication will be 
withdrawn from the study.  
Subjects who have previously taken a prohibited medication during the study will be 
withdrawn from the study unless:  
• the prohibited medication has been discontinued AND   
Study: ACP -103-047  Final Version: 1.0  
Protocol Amendment 4  Date: 5 March  2021 
 Confidential and Proprietary Information of Acadia Pharmaceuticals Inc. Page 32 of 62 • withdrawal from the study presents an unacceptable medical risk to the subject  
The justification to allow the subject to continue in the trial will be made by the 
Sponsor /Medical Monitor,  with medical input from the Investigator, and will be documented. 
If a subject is allowed to remain in the trial, this will be reported as a major protocol deviation and not a waiver . 
Permitted concomitant medications should remain at a stable dose throughout the study. Benzodiazepines (lorazepam up to 1 mg/day or equivale nt) are allowed as rescue medication 
as needed for severe neuropsychiatric or behavioral disturbances ( Appendix A ). 
5 INVESTIGATIONAL PRODUCT  
5.1 Investi gational Product Description 
The investigational product will be pimavanserin 20 mg (provided as 2×10 mg tablets) or 
pimavanserin 34 mg (provided as 2×17 mg tablets). Tablets will be administered orall y as a 
single dose once daily. 
5.1.1 Formulation, Appearance, Packaging, and Labeling 
The Sponsor will supply pimavanserin 10 mg and 17 mg tablets.  
Pimavanserin tartrate is a white to off -white
  powder. Pimavanserin tablets include the active 
compound (pimavanserin) and the following excipients: starch, mi crocrystalline cellulose, 
m
agnesium stearate, and the tablet coating is   The  drug product 
is f
ormulated with standard pharmaceutical excipients at 10 mg strength (11.8 mg of 
pimavanserin  tartrate) and 17 mg strength (20 mg of pima vanserin tartrate).  
Pimav
anserin used for the tablets is  manufactured under current Good Manufacturing 
Practice.  
During the treatment period, study drug will be supplied in 1 month t reatment kits. Kits will 
be distributed in a quantity sufficient to ensure the subject has an adequate supply of study 
drug between study visits. 
5.1.2 Product Storage and Stability  
Investigational product must be stored between  15°C to 30°C (59°F to 86°F ) in a secure area 
with restricted ac cess and according to local and national regulations. 
5.1.3 Dosing and Administration 
Eligible subjects will begin pimavanserin once-daily dosing at 34 mg. 
Dose adjustments of pimavanserin down to 20 mg and up to 34 mg are permitted at any study 
visit (scheduled or unscheduled) after Baseline based on Investigator assessment of clinical 

Study: ACP -103-047  Final Version: 1.0  
Protocol Amendment 4  Date: 5 March  2021 
 Confidential and Proprietary Information of Acadia Pharmaceuticals Inc. Page 33 of 62 response. The reason for dose titration should be captured in the eCRF. A dose change at a 
time other than at a scheduled clinical visit will require an unscheduled visit to dispe nse the 
appropriate dose of study drug. Unscheduled visits may occur as needed. 
Study drug will be dispensed to the subject to take home at the Baseline visit. The subject and 
study partner/caregiver will be provided instructions to take the first dose of study drug on the day after the Baseline visit. It is recommended that the subject take the study drug at 
approximately the same time each day . 
5.1.4 Method of A ssigning Subject  Number s 
All subjects will receive once daily doses of pimavanserin over 52 weeks of treatment. 
Details of pimavanserin dosing and administration are provided in Section 5.1.3. 
5.1.5 Blinding  
This is an open- label study.  
5.1.6 Study Drug Compliance  
If a subject misses one dose of study drug, he or she should not t ake an extra dose the next 
day. 
If a subject shows significant undercompliance (<80% compliance) between any two 
scheduled visits, the Medical Monitor should be notified to determine if the subject remains eligible for the study. 
In the event that a subject is permanently unable to return study drug to the site (i.e., drug is 
lost, destroyed, or discarded), the subject/caregiver testimony is to be used in determining compliance.  
5.1.7 Overdose  
An overdose is a deliberate or inadvertent administration of a treatment at a dose higher than the maximum recommended dose per protocol. It must be reported, irrespective of outcome, even if toxic effects were not observed ( Section 7.5.4). All events of overdose are to be 
captured as protocol deviations.  
5.2 Investigational Product Accountability Procedures  
The Investigator or designee will keep current and accurate records of t he study drug 
dispensed, used, and returned for each subject to assure the regulatory a uthority  and the 
Sponsor that the study drug is being handled appropriately. Subjects should be instructed to 
return all treatment kits, blister cards , and unused tablets to the Investigator at regularly 
scheduled clinic visits and any ET visits. Any study drug supplied is for use in this study only and should not be used for any other purpose. 
Study: ACP -103-047  Final Version: 1.0  
Protocol Amendment 4  Date: 5 March  2021 
 Confidential and Proprietary Information of Acadia Pharmaceuticals Inc. Page 34 of 62 At appropriate intervals during the study, study drug reconciliation will be performed by the 
Sponsor (or designee) who may return appropriate unused study drug and used and unus ed 
packaging to the Sponsor’s designee for destruction. 
At the conclusion of the study, final study drug reconciliation will be conducted at the site. 
Final  study drug accountability documentation will be maintained at both the site and at the 
Sponsor. Any remaining unused study drug and all used and unused packaging will be sent 
back to the Sponsor’s designee for destruction, as allowed by country specific regulations. Documentation of study drug destruction will be recorded and maintained by both the Sponsor and the Sponsor’s designee. 
6 STUDY PROCEDURES  
6.1 Baseline  Assessments  
Subject and study partner/caregiver consent for the present study must be  obtained prior to 
the final procedures being performed at the antecedent study’s EOT  or ET  visit (if the study 
was ended early by the Sponsor) and before any new procedure s are performed for the 
ACP -103-047 study. Data from th e EOT/ET procedures of the antecedent study will be 
carried over to the ACP-103-047 study to be included as baseline information for the present 
study and this visit will be considered Baseline (Visit 1).  
Study specific procedures are detailed below. All assessments will be completed according to 
the schedule described in  Table S –1. Every effort should be made to complete the required 
procedures and eval uations at the designated visits and times.  
6.1.1 Medical History  and Demographics 
A complete medical and psychiatric history will be obtained from each potential subject at 
Baseline (V isit 1). Demographic information, including date of birth, gender, race, and 
ethnicity (if allowed by local regulations) will be recorded as well. Any new medical condition beginning after the informed consent form (ICF) has been signed will be captured 
as an AE. Subjects may be as ked to provide pharmacy or medical records to substantiate the 
medication history.  
6.1.2 Psychiatric, Dementia, and Neurological History  
Details of the subject’s p sychiatric , dementia, and neurological history and treatment will be 
collected at Baseline (Visit 1). 
Study: ACP -103-047  Final Version: 1.0  
Protocol Amendment 4  Date: 5 March  2021 
 Confidential and Proprietary Information of Acadia Pharmaceuticals Inc. Page 35 of 62 6.2 Efficacy Assessments  
6.2.1 Clinical Global Impression – Severity Scale 
The CGI -S scale is a clinician -rated, 7 -point scale that is designed to rate the severit y of the 
subject’s neuropsychiatric symptoms at the time of assessment using the Investigator’s 
judgment and past experience with subjects  who have the same condition ( Guy 1976).  
The CGI -S will be assessed at Baseline (Visit 1) and at all scheduled and unscheduled visits. 
6.2.2 EQ-5D-5L 
The EQ -5D-5L is a standardized instrument used as a measure of health outcome 
(Kind  1996). It measures 5 dimensions (mobility, self -care, usual activities, pain/discomfort,  
anxiety/depression) each of which has 5 potential responses. The responses record 5 levels of 
severity (no problems/slight problems/moderate problems/severe problems/extreme 
problems) within a particular EQ -5D dimension. The EQ-5D-5L Proxy version 1 will be 
used. For this version, a study partner/caregiver (the proxy) is asked to rate the subject’s health -related quality of life in their (the proxy’s) opinion. 
The EQ -5D- 5L will be assessed  at Baseline (Visit 1) and at Weeks 12, 28, and 52. 
6.2.3 Sleep Disorders Inventory  
The Sleep Disorders Inventory (SDI) is an expanded version of one subscale of the Neuropsychiatric Inventory ( NPI; Tractenberg et al. 2003). It consists of the 7 questions from 
the NPI sleep behavior domain. Each question includes a study partner/caregiver rating of frequency, severity, and study partner/ caregiver distress with respect to th e patient -participant 
sleep behavior for the 2  weeks prior to the visit. Thus, in contrast to a single rating for 
frequency and sev erity for all sleep disturbance -related behaviors, which would be 
incorporated into an overall NPI score, the SDI total score is derived after  the study 
partner/caregiver rates the frequency and severity of each of the 7 separate sleep questions. 
Study par tner/caregiver distress ratings are not part of the SDI total score, but distress is 
measured.   
The SDI wi ll be assessed at Baseline and at Weeks 12, 28, and 52. 
6.3 Safety Assessments 
6.3.1 Physi cal Examinations 
A physical examination will be conducted at Baseline and at Week s 28 and 52. 
Study: ACP -103-047  Final Version: 1.0  
Protocol Amendment 4  Date: 5 March  2021 
 Confidential and Proprietary Information of Acadia Pharmaceuticals Inc. Page 36 of 62 6.3.2 Vital Signs  
Vital signs will include resting respiration rate, sitting systolic and diastolic blood pressure,  
pulse rate, and temperature and will be performed at all scheduled visits . The sitting blood 
pressure should be measured after the subject has been sitting for ≥ 3 minutes.  
6.3.3 Weight  
Weight will be reported  (in kilograms) at all scheduled visits.  
6.3.4 Electrocardiograms  
All 12 -lead electrocardiograms (ECGs) will be complete, standardized recordings. A single 
12-lead ECG  will be completed at all scheduled visits during the present study ( Table S –1). 
All ECGs will be centrally read; the interpretation by the central cardiologist is considered 
the official interpretation . If a site performs additional ECGs beyond the single ECG 
prescribe d at Baseline, the mean QTcF/QRS values of all the tracings of adequate quality will 
be used to determine eligibility.  
At Baseline, a subject may be enrolled based on the machine read of the locally completed ECG. If the interpretation of the ECG by the central cardiologist indicates QTcF  outside of 
the allowable range, the subject will be discontinued from the study, but this will not be 
considered a protocol deviation. 
The subject must rest in a supine position before the ECG is obtained. ECG tracings  (paper or 
electronic) will be reviewed and interpreted by a qualified clinician . ECG tracings and results 
(heart  rate, RR, PR, QRS, QT, QTcF , and QTcB interval  duration) will be included and 
summarized in the subject's study records. 
6.3.5 Suicidal Ideation and Behavior 
6.3.5.1 Columbia -Suicide Severity Rating Scale  
The C -SSRS monitors changes in suicidal thinking and behavior over time, in order to 
determine risk ( Posner et al. 2011). The following four constructs are measured: the severity 
of ideation, the intensity of ideation, behavior, and lethality.  
The C -SSRS will be used to assess suicidal ideations and behaviors in subjects who are able 
to reliably complete the assessment , according to the judgment of the Investigator . Whether 
or not the subject can complete the C -SSRS should be documented in the eCRF for each 
subject  at each visit . If the subject is not able to complete the C -SSRS, the GCAS should be 
used thereafter  in the study to assess suicidality.  
For subjects who completed the Baseline/Screenin g Version i n the antecedent study and are 
still able to complete the C- SSRS assessment  in the present study , the Since Last Visit 
Study: ACP -103-047  Final Version: 1.0  
Protocol Amendment 4  Date: 5 March  2021 
 Confidential and Proprietary Information of Acadia Pharmaceuticals Inc. Page 37 of 62 version will be administered at all visits . The C -SSRS results for each subject should be 
reviewed by the Investigator at each  visit. If at any time the C -SSRS results for a given 
subject reveal potential suicidality, then the Investigator should assess the clinical 
significance of such results. If a clinically significant risk of suicidality is identified for a subject, then the Investigat or should discontinue the subject and implement appropriate 
treatment ( Section  4.4).  
6.3.5.2 Global Clinician Assessment of Suicidality  
The GCAS is a clinician -rated, 5 -point scale that is designed to rate the subject’s  suicidality 
based on the report of the subject, the report of the study partner/caregiver, and the clinician’s global assessment. Ratings can be 0 (“Absent”), 1 (“Feel s life is not worth living”), 
2 (“Wishes he/she were dead or any thoughts of possible death to self”), 3 (“Suicidal ideas or gesture”), or 4 (“Attempt at suicide”). The Investigator will record a subject rating, a study partner/caregiver rating, and  a clinician rating.  
If the GCAS was used in the antecedent study, suicidality since- last-visit will be assessed at 
Visit 1 (Baseline) and at all other visits . 
If the subject is not able to reliably complete the C -SSRS at any point in the study in the 
Investigator’s judgment, the GCAS will be administered and used thereafter in the study. The first assessment with the GCAS should assess lifetime suicidality and suicidality for the past 
3 months and at all other visits, suicidality since the previous visit w ill be assessed.  
As with the C -SSRS, if at any time the GCAS results for a given subject revea l potential 
suicidality, then the Investigator should assess the clinical significance of such results. If a clinically significant risk of suicidality is identified for a subject, then the Investigator should 
discontinue the subject and implement appropri ate treatment (Section 4.4). 
6.3.6 Mini -Mental State Exami nation  
The Mini- Mental State Examination ( MMSE ) is a brief 30 -point questionnaire that is used to 
quantitatively assess cognition ( Folstein et al. 1975). The M MSE includes simple questions 
and problems in a number of areas: the time and place of testing, repeating lists of words, arithmetic, language use and comprehension, and copying a drawing. The MMSE is being used in this study to screen for cognitive impair ment and as a safety measure.  
The MMSE will be administered at all scheduled visits.  
6.3.7 Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale - Abbreviated  
The Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale ( ESRS ; Chouinard and Margolese 2005) was 
developed to assess drug induced movement disorders such as parkinsonism, akathisia, 
dystonia, and tardive dyskinesia with established reliability, validity, and sensitivity. It 
Study: ACP -103-047  Final Version: 1.0  
Protocol Amendment 4  Date: 5 March  2021 
 Confidential and Proprietary Information of Acadia Pharmaceuticals Inc. Page 38 of 62 consists of a questionnaire of parkinsonian symptoms, physician examination of 
parkinsonism, dyskinetic movements, and global impression of tardive dyskinesia. The 
ESRS -A, an accepted modified form of the original ESRS, will be used during the study to 
monitor for any worsening in extrapyramidal symptoms or signs at scheduled and 
unscheduled visits.  
6.3.8 Laboratory Evaluations

• Assessment of AEs  
6.5 Unscheduled Visits  
Unscheduled visits may occur as determined by the Investigator. The following assessments 
generally should be recorded at each uns cheduled  visit: assessment of AEs, assessment of 
concomitant medications/treatments, measurement of vital signs, CGI -S, ESRS- A, C -SSRS 
(Since Last Visit ve rsion) or the GCAS if the C -SSRS cannot be completed. The Investigator 
may perform any additional safety evaluations deemed to be clinically indicated. 
7 ADVERSE EVENTS  
7.1 Adverse Events  
Adverse events occurring after the first dose of open-label study drug in ACP -103-047 until 
safety follow-up assessment (conducted by telephone call) 30 days after the last dose of study 
drug, will be recorded as an AE in the ACP-103-047 study. 
All o ngoing AEs from the antecedent stud y (ACP -103-046) will be carried over and recorded  
from Baseline  for the ACP -103-047 study until resolution  or the follow- up safety assessment . 
All AEs must be either resolved or stable at end of study. If ongoing at the end of the study, 
the subject should be referred for appropriate treatment. 
7.2 Speci fication of Safety Parameters 
7.2.1 Definition of Adverse Event  
An AE is defined as “any untoward medi cal occurrence associated with the use of a drug in 
humans, whether or not considered drug related” ( US FDA  2012). 
An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (e.g., an abnormal laboratory 
finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug, without any 
judgment about causality or seriousness. An AE can arise from any use of the drug 
(e.g., off -label use, use in combination with another drug) and from any route of 
administration, formulation, or dose, including an overdose.  
A suspected adverse reaction is any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility that the 
drug caused the AE. 
AEs do not include the following: 
• Stable or  intermittent chronic conditions (such as myopia requiring eyeglasses) that 
are present prior to  Baseline of the ACP -103-047 study and do not worsen during the 
study 
Study: ACP -103-047  Final Version: 1.0  
Protocol Amendment 4  Date: 5 March  2021 
 Confidential and Proprietary Information of Acadia Pharmaceuticals Inc. Page 41 of 62 • Medical or surgical procedures (e.g., surgery, endoscopy, tooth extraction, 
transfusion). The condition that leads to the procedure is an AE if not present at 
Baseline of the ACP -103-047 study. 
• Overdose of concomitant medication without any signs or symptoms unless the 
subject is hospitalized for observation 
• Hospitalization for elective surgery  planned prior to study (situation where an 
untoward medical occurrence has not occurred)  
• Pregnancy will not be considered an AE, but if it occurs, it will be reported on a 
pregnancy form  
7.2.2 Definition of Serious Adverse Event  
In addition to the severity rating, each AE will be classified by the Investigator as “serious” 
or “not serious.” The seriousnes s of an event will be defined according to the applicable 
regulations and generally refers to the outcome of an event. An SAE is one that meets one or 
more of t he following: 
• Is fatal  
• Is immediately life threatening  
• Results in disability or permanent damage  
• Requires hospitalization  
• Prolongs existing hospitalization 
• Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect (in an offspring) 
• Is medically significant  
Definition of Lif e Threatening  
A life threatening event places the subject at immediate  risk of death from the event as it 
occurred . This does not include an AE, which, had it occurred in a more severe form, might 
have caused death. 
Definition of Hospitalization  
Hospitaliz ation is defined by the Sponsor as a full admission to the hospital for diagnosis and 
treatment . This includes prolongation of an existing inpatient hospitalization.  
Examples of visits to a hospital facility that do not meet the serious criteria for hospitalization include: 
• Emergency room visits (that do not result in a full hospital admission)  
• Outpatient surgery 
Study: ACP -103-047  Final Version: 1.0  
Protocol Amendment 4  Date: 5 March  2021 
 Confidential and Proprietary Information of Acadia Pharmaceuticals Inc. Page 42 of 62 • Preplanned or elective procedures  
• Protocol procedures 
• Social hospitalization, defined as admission to the hospital as a result of inadequate 
family support or care at the subject’s primary residence  
Definition of Disability or Permanent Damage 
Disability is defined as a persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the 
ability to conduct normal life functions. 
Definition of Med ically Significant  
Important medical events (medically significant events) that may not result in death, be life 
threatening, or require hospitalization may be considered to be an SAE when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the s ubject or may require medical or 
surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of 
such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic 
bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias, or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization or development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 
An SAE may also include any other event that the Investigator or Medical Monitor judges to 
be serious or that suggests a significant hazard, contraindication, side effect, or precaution. 
7.3 Classification of an Adverse Event 
7.3.1 Severity of Event 
The severity of each AE will be graded on a 3- point scale and reported in detail as indicated 
on the eCRF: 
• Mild : awareness of sign or symptom but easily tolerated, causing minimal 
discomfort, and not interfering with normal everyday activities 
• Moderate: sufficiently discomforting to interfere with normal everyday activities  
• Severe: incapacitating and/or preventing normal everyday activities 
7.3.2 Relationship to Study Drug  
The causality of each A E should be assessed and classified by the Investigator as “related” or 
“not related.” An event is considered related if there is a reasonable possibility that the event 
may have been caused by the product under investigation (i.e., there are facts, evidence, or 
arguments to suggest possible causation).

7.3.3 Definition of Unexpectedness  
An AE, the nature or severity of which is not consistent with the information provided in the 
Reference Safety Info rmation se ction of the current pimavanserin Investigator’s brochure. 
7.4 Time Period and Frequency for Event Assessment and Follow -up 
In the event that a subject is withdrawn from the study because of an AE, the subject should be followed and treated by the Investigator until the AE has resolved, stabilized, or a new chronic baseline has been established. 
7.5 Reporting Procedures  
7.5.1 Adverse Event Reporting  
The Investigator must record all observed AEs and all reported AEs. At each visit, the 
Investigator should ask the subject a nonspecific question (e.g., “Have you noticed anything 
different since your last visit?”) to assess whether any AEs have been experienced since the 
last report or visit.  
Note that any use of medication (and specifically any newly prescribed medication) during the course of a study may indicate the occurrence of an AE that may need to be recorded on 
both the AE and the concomitant medication page.  
All AEs, serious and not serious, will be recorded on the AE eCRF page using appropriate 
medical terminology . Severity and relationship to study drug will be assessed by the 
Investigator. 
When possible, clinical AEs should be described by diagnosis and not by symptoms 
(e.g., “cold” or “seasonal allergies” instead of “runny nose”).  
All AEs, whether or not related to the study drug, must be fully and completely documented 
on the AE eCRF and in the subject’s notes. 
Study: ACP -103-047  Final Version: 1.0  
Protocol Amendment 4  Date: 5 March  2021 
 Confidential and Proprietary Information of Acadia Pharmaceuticals Inc. Page 45 of 62 7.5.2 Serious Adverse Event Reporting  
The reporting of SAEs by the Sponsor or designee to the regulatory a uthorities is a regulator y 
requirement . Each regulatory authority has established a timetable for reporting SAEs based 
upon established criteria. 
Serious AEs must be reported within 24 hours of discovery to the Sponsor or its designee ; 
use the appropriate form for initial and/or follow-up reporting.  
At a minimum, events identified by the Sponsor to require expedited reporting as serious, 
unexpected, and related to study drug must be brought to the attention of the responsible institutional review board/ethics committee ( IRB/EC), a s per applicable reg ulations. These 
will be provided by the Sponsor after their assessment. For European Union ( EU) member 
states, the Sponsor or its designee will provide reports of suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSARs) directly to the E Cs, as required by l ocal legislation . In all other 
countries, it is the Investigator’s responsibility to provide these expedited reports to the responsible IRB/EC. It is also the Investigator’s responsibility to notify the responsible 
IRB/EC regarding any new and significant safety information. 
For this study, sites will complete the paper SAE  form (for initial and/or follow-up 
information) including available supporting documentation relevant to the event and fax or 
email (within 24 hours of discovery) to the contact informat ion provided on t he SAE  form. 
Subjects will be followed until EO T/ET for any SAEs and/or other reportable information or 
until such events have resolved or the Investigator, in conjunction with the Sponsor , deems 
them to be chronic or s table.  
In the event of any SAE (other than death), the study subject will be instructed to contact the Investigator (or designee) using the telephone number provided in the ICF. All subjects 
experiencing an SAE will be seen by the Investigator or designee as soon as is feasib le 
following the report of the SAE. 
Serious AEs occurring after the study Follow-up Period should be reported if in the judgment 
of the Investigator there is “a reasonable possibility” that the event may have been caused by the product. 
SAEs should also be reported to the IRB/EC according to local regulations. 
7.5.3 Reporting of Pregnancy 
Any female subject who becomes pregnant during the study (with or without AEs) must be 
withdrawn from the study and the pregnancy must be reported on the P regnancy form within 
24 hours of discovery to the Sponsor or its designee. Any female subject who becomes 
pregnant during the study will be followed through the first well-baby visit. 
Study: ACP -103-047  Final Version: 1.0  
Protocol Amendment 4  Date: 5 March  2021 
 Confidential and Proprietary Information of Acadia Pharmaceuticals Inc. Page 46 of 62 Any AEs that are the consequence of pregnancy and which meet the criteria for serious  
should also be reported via the SAE form. 
7.5.4 Overdose  
An overdose is a deliberate or inadvertent administration of a treatment at a dose higher than 
the maximum recommended dose per protocol. It must be reported to the Sponsor or designee on the O verdose f orm within 24 hours of discovery. 
8 CLINICAL MONITORING  
Routine monitoring of study sites is described in Section 11.2. 
Clinical site monitoring is conducted to ensure that the rights and well-being of human 
subjects are protected, that the reported study data are accurate, complete, and verifiable, and 
that the conduct of the study is in compliance with the currently approved protocol and 
amendment(s) as applicable, with  GCP, and with applicable regulatory requirements. Details 
of the study site monitoring process are described in a separate clinical monitoring plan document.

10 STUDY MANAGEMENT AND DATA COLLECTION 
10.1 Data Collection and Management Responsibilities 
All documents required for the conduct of the study as specified in the ICH GCP guidelines 
will be maintained by th e Investigator in an orderly manner and made available for 
monitoring and/or auditing by the Sponsor and regulatory a uthorities . 
The Investigator and institution must permit authorized representatives of the Sponsor or 
designees (including monitors and auditors), regulatory a uthorities  (including inspectors), 
and the IRB/EC direct access to source documents (such as original medical records) . Direct 
access includes permission to examine, analyze, verify, and reproduce any records and 
Study: ACP -103-047  Final Version: 1.0  
Protocol Amendment 4  Date: 5 March  2021 
 Confidential and Proprietary Information of Acadia Pharmaceuticals Inc. Page 49 of 62 reports that are needed  for the evaluation of the study. The Investigator must ensure the 
reliability and availability of source documents from which th e information on the eCRF was 
derived. 
10.2 Source Documents  
All study specific information obtained at each study visit must be recorded in the subject’s 
record (source documentation), and then entered into a validated electronic data capture 
(EDC ) database by  trained site personnel. The source documentation may consist of source 
notes captured by site personnel as well as laboratory reports, ECG reports, and electronic 
source data.  
10.3 Case Report Forms  
Subject data required by this protocol are to be recorded in an EDC system on eCRFs. The 
Investigator and his or her site personnel will be responsible for completing the eCRFs. The 
Investigator is responsible for the accuracy and reliability of all the information recorded on the eCRFs . All information requested on the eCRFs needs to be supplied, including subject 
identification data, visit date(s), assessment values, etc., and any omission or discrepancy will require explanation. All information on eCRFs must be traceable to source documentation at the site.  
10.4 Confid entiality  
The Investigator must ensure that each subject’s anonymity is maintained as described below. On the eCRFs or other documents submitted to the Sponsor or designees, subjects must be identified by a Subject Identification Number only. Subject identifiers uniquely identify 
subjects within the study and do not identify any person specifically.  
Documents that are not for submission to the Sponsor or designees (e.g., signed ICFs) should 
be kept in strict confidence by the Investigator in compliance with Federal regulations or other applicable laws or ICH Guidance on GCP. 
10.5 Study Records Retention  
Investigators are required to maintain all essential study documentation as per ICH GCP 
guidelines. This includes, but is not limited to, copies of signed, dated and completed eCRFs, documentation of eCRF corrections, signed ICFs, audio recordings, subject- related source 
documentation, and adequate records for the receipt and disposition of all study drug. Investigators should maintain all essential study document ation, for a period of at least 
2 years following the last approval of marketing application in an ICH region (US, Europe, and Japan), or until at least 2 years after the drug investigational program is discontinued, 
unless a longer period is required by applicable law or regulation. Only the Sponsor can 
Study: ACP -103-047  Final Version: 1.0  
Protocol Amendment 4  Date: 5 March  2021 
 Confidential and Proprietary Information of Acadia Pharmaceuticals Inc. Page 50 of 62 notify an Investigator or vendor when any records may be discarded. Investigators should 
contact the Sponsor before destroying any files. 
10.6 Protocol Exceptions and Deviations 
No prospective entry criteria protocol deviations are allowed; all subjects must meet all 
eligibility criteria in order to participate in the study.  
Protocol waivers for eligibility will not be granted by the Sponsor under any circumstances. 
If, during the course of a subject’s participat ion in the trial it is discovered that the subject did 
not meet  all eligibility criteria, he or she will be discontinued, unles s the discontinuation 
presents an unacceptable medical risk . The justification to allow the subject to continue in the 
trial will be made by the Sponsor, with medical input from the Investigator, and will be documented. If allowed to remain in the trial, this will be reported as a major protocol 
deviation and not a waiver. All follow -up safety assessments must be completed and 
documented as outlined in the protocol ( Section  6.4). The Investigator must report any 
protocol deviation to the Sponsor and, if required, to the IRB/EC in accordance with local 
regulations, within reasonable time.  
10.7 Protocol Amendments  
Changes to the protocol may be made only by the Sponsor (with or without consultation with 
the Investigator) . All protocol modifications must be submitted to the site IRB/EC in 
accordance with local req uirements and, if required, to regulatory a uthorities , as eith er an 
amendment or a notification . Approval for amendments must be awaited before any changes 
can be implemented, except for changes necessary to eliminate an immediate hazard to trial 
subjects, or when the changes involve only logistical or administrative aspects of the trial . 
No approval is required for notifications. 
11 QUALITY MANAGEMENT  
11.1 Risk Management  
The Sponsor utilizes the ICH E6 (GCP) Revision 2 risk management approach that includes 
methods to assure and control the quality of the trial proportionate to the risks inherent in the trial and the importance of the information collected. The intent is that all aspects of this trial are operationally feasible and that any unnecessary complexity, procedures, and data 
collection are avoided. The Sponsor’s risk management approach includes the following 
activities with a focus on critical processes and critical study data:  
• Risk Identification: identification of risks to critical study processes, governing systems, investigational product, study design, data collection, and recording. 
Study: ACP -103-047  Final Version: 1.0  
Protocol Amendment 4  Date: 5 March  2021 
 Confidential and Proprietary Information of Acadia Pharmaceuticals Inc. Page 51 of 62 • Risk Evaluation: identified risks are evaluated by considering the following factors: 
(a) likelihood of error occurrence, (b) impact on human subject protection and data integrity, 
and (c) detectability of errors.  
• Risk Control: risks that can be reduced (e.g., mitigating) or can be accepted are 
differentiated. Risk mitigation activities are incorporated in protocol design and implementation, study plans, training, processes, and other documents governing the 
oversight and execution of study activities. Where possible, predefined quality tolerance 
limits are to be defined to identify systematic issues that can impact subject safety or data integrity and deviations from the predefined quality tolerance limits will trigger a n evaluation 
and possibly an action. Contingency plans are developed for issues with a high risk factor 
that cannot be avoided. 
• Periodic Risk Review, communication and escalation of Risk Management activities 
during trial execution and risk outcome repor ting in the Clinical Study Report (CSR).  
11.2 Quality Control and Quality Assurance 
The Sponsor or designees and regulatory authority inspectors are responsible for contacting and visiting the Investigator for the purpose of inspecting the facilities and, upon request, inspecting the various records of the trial (e.g., eCRFs and other pertinent data) provided that subject confidentiality is respected.  
The Sponsor’s or designee’s monitor is responsible for inspecting the eCRFs at regular intervals throughout the study to verify adherence to the protocol; completeness, accuracy, and consistency of the data; and adherence to local regulations on the conduct of clinical 
research . The monitor should have access to subject medical records and other study- related 
records needed to verify the entries on the eCRFs.  
The Investigator agrees to cooperate with the monitor to ensure that any problems detected in 
the course of these monitoring visits are resolved. 
In accordance with ICH Guidance on GCP and the Sponsor’s audit pl ans, a certain 
percentage of sites participating in this study will be audited. These audits may include a 
review of site facilities (e.g., pharmacy, drug storage areas, and laboratories) and review of study- related records may occur in order to evaluate t he trial conduct and compliance with 
the protocol, ICH Guidance on GCP, and applicable regulatory requirem ents. 
The Sponsor’s or designee’s representatives, regulatory authority inspectors and IRB/EC representatives who obtain direct access to source documents should also respect subject confidentiality, taking all reasonable precautions in accordance with applicable regulatory 
requirements to maintain the confidentiality of subjects’ identities.

Appendix A  Prohibited and Restricted Medications  
Subjects taking prohibited medications at study entry will not be eligible for the study.  
The Investigator may prescribe, adjust, or discontinue appropriate medication to treat or 
manage AEs. Subjects who require current treatment with a prohibited medication will be 
withdrawn from the study.  
Subjects who have previously taken a prohibited medication during the study will be 
withdrawn from the study unless:  
• the prohibited medication has been discontinued AND  
• withdrawal from the study presents an unacceptable medical risk to the subject  
The ju stification to allow the subject to continue in the trial will be made by the 
Sponsor/Medical Monitor, with medical input from the Investigator, and will be documented. If a subject is allowed to remain in the trial, this will be reported as a major protoc ol 
deviation and not a waiver. 
The table below lists prohibitions and restrictions by medication class, including 
representative medications within class. A prohibited medication is not allowed. A restricted  
medication is allowed only under certain conditions.

 Confidential and Proprietary Information of Acadia Pharmaceuticals Inc. Page 61 of 62 Appendix B  Prohibited and Restricted Concomitant Medications: Inhibitors and 
Inducers of Cytochrome P450 Enzyme 3A4 
The information presented here is intended to provide guidance and does not constitute an 
exhaustive list of strong CYP 3A4 enzyme (CYP3A4) inhibitors and inducers. Any questions should be discussed with the Medical Monitor or appropriate designee.  
The In vestigator may prescribe, adjust, or discontinue appropriate medication to treat or 
manage AEs. Subjects who require current treatment with a prohibited medication will be 
withdrawn from the study.  
Subjects who have previously taken a prohibited medication during the study will be 
withdrawn from the study unless:  
• the prohibited medication has been discontinued AND  
• withdrawal from the study presents an unacceptable medical risk to the subject  
The justification to allow the subject to continue in the trial will be made by the 
Sponsor/Medical Monitor, with medical input from the Investigator, and will be documented. 
If a subject is allowed to remain in the trial, this will be reported as a major protocol 
deviation and not a waiver.   
The metabolism of pimavanserin is affected by strong CYP3A4 inhibitors, resulting in an increase in maximum plasma concentration (C
max) and area under the plasma 
concentration -time curve (AUC) of approximately 3 -fold.  
Strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 are to be stopped at least 7 days or 5 half- lives , whichever is 
longer, prior to the administration of study drug. Strong inducers of CYP3A4 are to be stopped 30 days or 5 half -lives , whichever is longer, prior to the administration of study drug.  
Moderate inhibitors and inducers of CYP3A4 may be allowed but should be used with caution.

a The effect of grapefruit juice varies widely among brands and is concentration -, dose -, and preparation -
dependent. Studies have shown that it can be classified as a “strong CYP3A inhibitor” when a certain preparation was used (e.g., high dose, double st rength)  or as a “moderate CYP3A inhibitor” when another 
preparation was used (e.g., low dose, single strength). (FDA Drug Development and Drug Interactions)

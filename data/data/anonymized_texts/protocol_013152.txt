ABSTRACT:  34 
This study will test the effects of an intervention called L eadership and Organizational Change for 35 
Implementation (LOCI), relative to implementation as usual (IAU), on clinician fidelity to, and youth 36 
service outcomes of, a well -established digital measurement -based care intervention in outpatient 37 
community mental  health clinics. The study involves a randomized controlled trial of LOCI in 21 publicly - 38 
funded mental health clinics, incorporating 120 clinicians who deliver outpatient psychotherapy to 39 
youth and , over two phases,  a total of 720 caregivers of youth outpatients who receive services at the 40 
clinics.  41 
 42 
OVERALL OBJECTIVES:  43 
This study will test the LOCI implementation strategy in two phases to determine whether it improves 44 
fidelity to a digital measurement -based care intervention calle d the Outcomes Questionnaire -Analyst 45 
(OQ-A) as well as service outcomes of youth (i.e., symptoms and functioning during the first 6 months of 46 
treatment as reported by caregivers). All clinics and clinicians will receive training in the OQ -A system as 47 
well as  implementation support (technical assistance) from the OQ -A developer (this represents the 48 
implementation as usual condition). In addition, half the clinics will be randomly assigned to LOCI to 49 
support implementation and sustainment of the OQ -A system.   50 
 51 
Leaders in organizations assigned to the LOCI condition will participate in the LOCI intervention for 12 52 
months. LOCI provides consultation and training to organizational leaders in how to support the 53 
implementation of evidence -based practices such as t he OQ -A system (see intervention details below). 54 
To test the effects of LOCI, we will examine outcomes of (a) fidelity to the OQ -A system  (measured at 55 
the youth level) , and (b) youth service outcomes (as reported by caregivers) during two phases following 56 
initial training in the OQ -A system: Phase 1 - initial implementation (months 1 -12 post - OQ-A training), 57 
and Phase 2 - sustainment (months 13 -24 post - OQ-A training). Clinician fidelity to the OQ -A system will 58 
be measured via (a) electronic meta -data from the OQ -A system, which indicates whether or not 59 
clinicians viewed the feedback reports, and (b) via caregiver reports. Youth service outcomes will be 60 
measured via caregiver reports of the youth's symptoms and functioning for six months following the 61 
youth' s initiation of treatment . 62 
 63 
The project addresses the following specific aims and associated hypotheses:  64 
 65 
Aim 1: Test the effects of LOCI on the implementation of a digital measurement -based care intervention 66 
called the OQ -A (Phase 1 ).  67 
Hypotheses: Relative to implementation as usual, (1a) clinicians in LOCI organizations will exhibit 68 
higher fidelity to OQ -A, and (1b) youths in LOCI organizations will experience superior service 69 
outcomes (i.e. improvements in symptoms and functioning), fo r 1-12 months following initial 70 
OQ-A training.  71 
 72 
Aim 2: Test the effects of LOCI on the sustainment of the digital OQ -A intervention ( Phase 2 ). 73 
Hypotheses: Relative to implementation as usual, (2a) clinicians in LOCI organizations will exhibit 74 
higher fidel ity to OQ -A 13 -24 months following initial OQ -A training, and (2b) youths in LOCI 75 
organizations will experience superior service outcomes (i.e., improvements in symptoms/ 76 
functioning) 13 -24 months following initial OQ -A training.   77 
 78 
Aim 3: Test the mechani sms that link LOCI to OQ -A fidelity.  79 
Hypotheses: (3a) Relative to implementation as usual, LOCI will improve leaders’ 80 
transformational, transactional, and implementation leadership, organizational implementation 81 
climate, and clinicians’ intentions to use the OQ -A system; (3b) Improvements in leadership, 82 
climate, and intentions will mediate LOCI’s effects on OQ -A fidelity.  83 
 84 
Primary outcomes variable(s):  85 
The primary outcomes will be fidelity to the OQ -A system , measured via meta -data from the OQ system,  86 
and youth clinical outcomes, measured as symptoms and functioning, during the initial six months of 87 
services for each youth.  88 
 89 
Secondary outcome variable(s):  90 
The secondary outcomes will be LOCI’s effects on first -level leadership behaviors, organizational 91 
imple mentation climate, and clinicians’ intentions to use the OQ -A system.   92 
 93 
STUDY BACKGROUND  94 
Psychiatric  disorders are the leading cause of mortality and disability among youth in high income 95 
countries, accounting for 21% of total disease burden, and afflicting 1 in 10 youths in the US with severe 96 
impairment.1 -3 In the  US, this extreme disease burden is matc hed by medical care expenditures, which 97 
are higher for youth psychiatric disorders than any other childhood illness ($16.8 billion in 2011),4 and 98 
by investments in clinical research, which have developed over 1,200 effective interventions, or 99 
evidence -base d practices (EBPs), shown to improve youth well -being in randomized trials.5, 6 However, 100 
despite these significant investments, less than half of youths treated in community settings experience 101 
symptom improvement,7, 8 a situation largely attributed to the  low rates at which community providers 102 
adopt EBPs and, even when adopted, the low fidelity with which EBPs are implemented and sustained.9 - 103 
12  104 
 105 
Policymakers and service systems have sought to address this implementation deficit through legislative 106 
mandate s and widespread EBP training programs for clinicians; however, these efforts have failed to 107 
meaningfully change practice patterns or improve patient outcomes.13 -17 Recent reviews indicate that 108 
many deficits in EBP implementation and sustainment can be tra ced to a lack of organization -level 109 
‘social infrastructure,’ that is, social contexts and leadership that do not support and motivate clinicians 110 
to use EBP. Without this organizational social infrastructure, EBP training and technical efforts fail.12, 111 
18-20 These observations are consistent with decades of research on organizational climate theory21 -24 112 
and with theories of behavior change,25 -27 which we have integrated to generate our primary 113 
hypothesis: achieving effective implementation and sustainment of  EBPs in community settings requires 114 
mechanisms of a strong organizational implementation climate and high clinician motivation generated 115 
through effective clinic leadership. With NIH support, we have pilot tested a highly transportable 116 
implementation stra tegy called the Leadership and Organizational Change for Implementation (LOCI) 117 
intervention that targets these mechanisms through (1) short -term, intensive consultation with senior 118 
leaders (i.e., executives/ administrators) and (2) training and coaching of  first-level leaders (i.e., clinical 119 
supervisors). Preliminary studies indicate LOCI is feasible, acceptable, and improves implementation 120 
leadership and implementation climate.28, 29 We propose a randomized controlled trial of LOCI in 20 121 
children’s mental health clinics, incorporating 120 clinicians and a total of 720 youth outpatients during 122 
two phases of initial implementation (months 1 -12) and sustainment (months 13 -24), to test LOCI’s 123 
effects relative to implementation as usual (IAU) on clinician fideli ty and youth clinical outcomes of a 124 
well-established digital measurement -based care (MBC) intervention.30, 31  125 
 126 
Digital MBC systems, which integrate with electronic health records to collect treatment outcome data 127 
from patients and provide clinicians with real-time feedback and recommendations based on ‘big data’ 128 
actuarial algorithms, are a high -impact digital health technology and EBP32 shown in 29 RCTs to 129 
generate improvements in clinical outcomes equivalent with the best psychotherapy protocols (i.e., 130 
d=.3-.5) across patient ages, diagnoses, and treatment modalities.32, 33 Despite the promise of this 131 
approach, digital MBC systems are rarely used in community settings for youth,34, 35 and when they 132 
are, fidelity and sustainment are often poor, primarily du e to deficits in organizational leadership and 133 
social context.36 -40 This trial tests whether the LOCI strategy can improve the implementation and 134 
sustainment of digital MBC for youth.  135 
 136 
STUDY POPULATION  137 
 138 
Target Population:  139 
We will recruit  and collect data from f our groups of people for this project: 1) executives and upper -level  140 
leaders (i.e., CEOs, Executive Directors, program administrators) of outpatient mental health clinics that 141 
serve youth, 2) clinic first -level leaders (i.e. clinical supervisors) in these clinics, 3) clinicians serving 142 
children with emotional and behavioral disorders in the clinics, and 4) parents/ caregivers of children 143 
with emotional and behavioral disorders who receive mental health services from participating clinics.  144 
 145 
Accrual:  146 
Based on our a priori power analyses, we anticipate the study will require the following number of 147 
participants in each group to generate adequate power to test our hypotheses:  148 
 149 
Clinics - N=20  150 
Executive leaders - N=20  151 
First -level clinic leaders - N=40  152 
Clinicians - N=120  153 
Parents/ caregivers of youth – Total N=720 (recruited in two phases of N=360 per phase)  154 
 155 
These figures will serve as recruitment targets. However, we also note that we plan to open enrollment 156 
in the study to all clinicians at participati ng clinics  and to all leaders in LOCI clinics as a way of improving 157 
the ecological validity of our results. Thus, our final sample size numbers may exceed those reported 158 
above.  159 
 160

 186 
Subject Recr uitment and Screening:  187 
This project involves multiple levels of recruitment which will be implemented by members of the 188 
research team including the PI, Co -Is, a Postdoctoral Researcher /Project Coordinator , a full -time 189 
Research Associate, and trained gradua te student research assistants. All members of the research team 190 
will complete training and certification (CITI) in Human Subjects research prior to recruiting participants 191 
and will be trained in relevant recruitment protocols by the PI, Co -I Esp, or the P ostdoctoral Researcher. 192 
We note that all recruitment will occur in  mental health outpatient clinics  located in  Idaho, Oregon, and 193 
Nevada.  194 
 195 
Recuitment will proceed in stages beginning with the recruitment of executive directors and CEOs of 196 
behavioral healt h clinics that deliver outpatient mental health services to youth. Once these leaders 197 
have agreed that their clinic will participate in the study, we will recruit first -level leaders (i.e., 198 
supervisors of clinicians), and clinicians who work in participati ng clinics. We will obtain a Memorandum 199 
of Understanding for all clinics that particpiate. After recruiting clinic staff, parents/ caregivers of youth 200 
who are served by the clinics will be notified about the study via a cover letter and invited to particip ate 201 
if they wish. Parents/ Caregivers who have questions about the study will be referred to a member of 202 
the research team.  The individuals who will compete these various stages of recruitment will be as 203 
follows:  204 
 205 
(1) recruitment of clinic executives - PI (primary), Co -Is (primary), Postdoctoral Researcher /Project 206 
Coordinator , 207 
(2) recruitment of first -level clinic leaders and clinicians – PI, Co -I Esp (primary), Postdoc 208 
Researcher /Project Coordinatory  (primary), Research Associate (primary), graduate research 209 
assistant  210 
(3) recruitment of caregivers of youth – Postdoc Researcher /Project Coordinator  (primary), Research 211 
Associate (primary), graduate research assistant, PI, Co -I Esp  212 
 213 
Details of the recrui tment process for each group as follows:  214 
 215 
(1) Clinic Executives will be recruited by the PI and Co -Is Esp, Aarons, and Ehrhart via two strategies. 216 
One strategy involves presenting an overview of the study at standing system meetings (e.g., 217 
regional behavioral health provider meetings; directors meetings sponsored by Medicaid) and other 218 
large -scale events and distributing follow up email through system contact lists and targeted emails 219 
to program/clinic leaders to arrange site visits and consultations . The second recruitment strategy 220 
involves directly contacting executives of behavioral health clinics in Idaho, Oregon, and Nevada  via 221 
email , phone , and/or postal mail  to request a in-person or vitual meeting with clinic leaders to 222 
present the study and a ssess their interest in participating. We will directly contact the CEOs/ 223 
Executive Directors of clinics and the PI, Co -Is Esp, Aarons, and Ehrhart, and/ or the Postdoctoral 224 
Researcher /Project Coordinator  will hold informational meetings with clinic execut ives to discuss 225 
the study procedures in detail and request their clinic's participation in the project. Executive 226 
leaders who agree for their clinic to participate in the study will sign a Memorandum of 227 
Understanding outlining roles and responsibilities of  all parties.  228 
 229 
(2) After obtaining permission from clinic executives, we will work to recruit first -level leaders and 230 
clinicians who work in each clinic. Recruitment of first -level leaders will be completed by the PI, Co - 231 
Is Esp, Aarons, and Ehrhart, as well a s the Postdoc Researcher and/ or Research Associate. With the 232 
executive's support, we will introduce the study to first -level leaders and clinicians (ideally during 233 
standing staff meetings) and ask them to participate . A member of the research team will ma ke a 234 
presentation during regularly scheduled staff or team meetings at the participating clinics. Details of 235 
the project and requirements of participation will be discussed during this presentation. Following 236 
the presentation, the research team will ask fo r permission from the Executive and First -level 237 
leaders to receive a list of eligible clinicians so we can contact  them via an automated Qualtrics  238 
email that includes a  link to the survey.  The clinicians will also be informed that they will receive an 239 
email from our team with a link to survey s. Once the research team receives the list of eligible 240 
clinicians from the agency executive or first -level leader, email s with link s to the consent form and 241 
survey s will be sent via BSU Qualtrics. The email include s the research team’s contact information, 242 
details about the study, and procedures. Clinicians will have one month to complete the survey if 243 
interested.  244 
 245 
There will be no consequences for clinicians who choose not to participate in the study. Clinicians 246 
will be assured that choosing to participate or not participate in the research will in no way affect 247 
their employment. All clinicians will be free to withdraw their participation at any time.   248 
 249 
(3) Caregivers will be recruited for the study via a multistep pr ocess.  250 
  251 
First, during the intake appointment, a clinician or clinic staff member will provide caregivers  with a 252 
cover letter  either in person or via electronic health record system. The cover letter will be available 253 
in English and Spanish (translated pro fessionally). The cover letter will state that the clinic is 254 
participating in a research study and that the parent is invited to participate if they wish; however, it 255 
will be stressed that the parent's decision regarding participation in the study will have  no effect on 256 
their ability to receive treatment at the clinic. The letter will provide details  regarding the 257 
assessments caregivers will be asked to complete as part of the study. It will ask parents to indicate 258 
if they are interested in being contacted b y a member of the research team for more information 259 
about study and to potentially participate. Parents who wish to participate in the study will check 260 
"YES" on the form and provide  their contact information (name, email, and phone number); parents 261 
who do  not wish to participate will check " DECLINE " and/ or leave the form incomplete. Parents will 262 
return their intake paperwork to a clinic staff member who will remove the cover letter and will fax 263 
or email the letters to a secure fax line or email address pr ovided by the research team. They will 264 
then place it in an envelope in a secure area behind a locked door with restricted access (e.g., where 265 
other medical files are stored). Participating clinics are used to storing sensitive medical files and 266 
other data and restricting access to these files. After the letter has been received by the research 267 
team, clinics staff will be asked to shred/discard letters.  If parents have questions about the study, 268 
they will be directed to the PI or Postdoc /Project Coordinator  by providing them with the research 269 
team's contact information.  270 
 271 
Approximately 2 -3 times per week, a member of the research team will contact the clinic to see if 272 
there are any forms to be faxed or mailed. All forms will be saved in a secure, electronic database 273 
housed on password protected Boise State University computers. This database will be used to track 274 
contacts with caregivers for the following steps of the recruitment process.  275 
 276 
Caregiver s who  signed the form indicat ing they are interested in learning more and potentially 277 
participate in the study , will receive a  phone to screen for eligibility and conduct an informed 278 
consent interview . Please refer to the “Procedures” section of the protocol for details on what 279 
happens after a participant is re cruited and screened.  280 
 281 
Early Withdrawal of Subjects:  282 
At any time during participation, subjects can decide to withdraw from the study. They can do this by  283 
not completing the survey s or by requesting that the assessment s be terminated . 284 
 285 
Vulnerable Populations:  286 
We will not be recruiting minors.   287 
 288 
Populations vulnerable to undue influence or coercion:  289 
Subjects are informed that participation is completely voluntary . There is no penalty for withdrawing or 290 
terminating their participation at any time during the study. There will be no consequences for clinicians 291 
who choose not to participate in the study. Clinicians will be assured that choosing to participate or not 292 
participate in the research will in no way affect their employment. In addition, caregivers will also be 293 
assured that choosing to participating or not  participating in the research will no way affect services at 294 
their clinic. All subjects will be free to withdraw their participation at any time.   295 
 296 
Design:  297 
This study is a c luster randomized controlled trial. We will randomize 22 clinics (target n = 20) to an  298 
implementation as usual (IAU) control group or to an experimental group that includes IAU + LOCI. 299 
Clinics that are randomly assigned to the LOCI condition will begin LOCI activities one month before the 300 
initial OQ -A training.  One month after initiation of LOCI, all clinicians in both LOCI and IAU clinics will 301 
participate in an initial, in -person, OQ -A training workshop delivered by the system developer. For six 302 
months following the OQ -A training, all clinics will have access t o implementation support provided by 303 
the OQ -A developer. LOCI activities will continue for a total of 12 months. Recruitment of caregivers into 304 
the study for Phase 1 will begin immediately after the OQ -A training and will conclude 12 months after 305 
the train ing. Measurement of clinician fidelity and service outcomes for these youth will continue for six 306 
months after completion of LOCI because caregivers recruited in month 12 need to be followed for six 307 
months after initiation of treatment. Recruitment of care givers into the study for Phase 2 will begin in 308 
month 13 after the initial OQ -A training and will continue for 12 months with caregivers recruited in 309 
month 24 followed for an additional 6 months to ensure adequate follow -up time. Caregivers will be 310 
asked t o complete measures that assess their child/youth's symptoms and functioning as well as the 311 
clinicians' use of the OQ -A system during a total of 7 telephone calls during a 6 month period (baseline, 312 
then monthly thereafter for 6 months).   313 
 314 
Study Duration:  315 
The study involves a randomized controlled trial of LOCI in 2 1 children’s mental health clinics, 316 
incorporating 120 clinicians and a total of 720 youth outpatients during two phases  of initial 317 
implementation (months 1 -12 post - OQ-A training) and sustainment  (months 13 -24 post - OQ-A training). 318 
All clinics will receive training in the OQ -A system and implementation support from the OQ -A developer 319 
for 6 months (this represents implementation as usual). In addition, half the clinics will be randomly 320 
assigned to LOCI to support implementation and sustainment of the OQ -A system. Leaders in 321 
organizations assigned to the LOCI condition will participate in the LOCI intervention for 12 months. The 322 
other half of agencies will be randomly assigned to the web -based leader ship condition. Caregivers of 323 
youth who receive services from clinicians in participating clinics will be surveyed for six months to 324 
assess service outcomes (measured as changes in the target youth’s symptoms and functioning).  325 
 326 
STUDY METHODS  327 
 328 
Study Instruments:   329 
• Primary outcomes for Aim 1 are clinician fidelity to MBC and improvement in youth symptoms and 330 
functioning. Clinician fidelity to MBC will be measured using triangulated data from (a) gold - 331 
standard observational electronic meta -data collected  automatically by the OQ -A system, and (b) 332 
parent/ caregiver reports. For each youth at each session, the OQ -A records whether an outcome 333 
measure was administered, whether the clinician viewed the feedback report, when the clinician 334 
viewed the feedback in relation to the session , and whether supplemental measures regarding 335 
treatment process (e.g., therapeutic alliance, self -efficacy) were administered to aid in diagnosing 336 
problems. This data will be downloaded from the OQ -A system for each participating you th each 337 
month and, following validated procedures outlined by Bickman et al.,36, 41 used to generate an 338 
MBC Fidelity Index that characterizes clinicians’ fidelity to MBC fidelity for each youth’s entire 339 
course of treatment. In addition, parents will report  on MBC fidelity using the MBC Fidelity Scale, a 340 
3-item measure validated in previous research.90 The 3 items produce a continuous score that 341 
captures (a) the extent to which the clinician invited the caregiver and/ or youth to complete a 342 
standardized outc ome measure at each session, (b) the extent to which the clinician discussed 343 
scores on the measure with the caregiver at each session, and (c) the extent to which the clinician 344 
used outcome measure data to make recommendations about the child’s treatment o r changes to 345 
the treatment plan. Parents will report on clinicians’ MBC fidelity during monthly phone 346 
assessments  described above and these scores will be averaged into a single score characterizing 347 
the clinician’s total fidelity to MBC for the youth’s ent ire course of treatment.  348 
• Youth clinical outcomes will be assessed using two caregiver - and youth -reported measures. The 349 
primary outcome is the 48-item Shortform Assessment for Children (SAC)  Total Problems Score. The 350 
SAC is a well -established, parent -repor ted, measure of youth internalizing and externalizing 351 
symptoms used in several previous randomized trials.91 -94 The SAC has demonstrated excellent 352 
score reliability and validity in psychometric evaluations as well as sensitivity to change in clinical 353 
trials of youth mental health services. The measure provides a total problem score; higher scores 354 
indicate more severe symptoms. The Columbia Impairment Scale (CIS) is a 13 -item measure of the 355 
youth’s psychosocial functioning and general impairment in the areas  of home, school, and 356 
community settings. The CIS has excellent score reliability, validity, and sensitivity to change as well 357 
as a clinical cut -score for assessing impairment; it is incorporated into several national 358 
epidemiological studies of youth psych opathology.98 -101 Caregivers will be compensated for 359 
completing the SAC, SDQ, and CIS at baseline and monthly thereafter (for a total of 6 months) via 360 
telephone calls.  361 
• We will assess targeted mechanisms of LOCI using the following measures: The Multifacto r 362 
Leadership Questionnaire (MLQ)113 is one of the most widely used measures of transformational 363 
and transactional leadership in organizations, including mental health agencies, and has excellent 364 
psychometric properties (alpha = .76 to .90).62 -64 Clinicians  rate the extent to which their leader 365 
engages in specific leadership behaviors on a 5 -point scale (0=Not at all, 4=Frequently, if not 366 
always). Transformational leadership is assessed by four subscales: Idealized Influence (8 items, 367 
α=.87), Inspirational M otivation (4 items, α=.91), Intellectual Stimulation (4 items, α=.90), and 368 
Individual Consideration (4 items, α=.90). The Implementation Leadership Scale (ILS)70 is a very brief 369 
12-item measure developed with NIH support by our team to assess leaders’ beha viors that support 370 
EBP implementation in four areas: Proactive Leadership (α=.95), Knowledgeable Leadership (α=.96), 371 
Supportive Leadership (α=.95), and Perseverant Leadership (α=.96). The ILS yields subscale scores 372 
and a total score (α=.98) which have demo nstrated excellent reliability and convergent and 373 
discriminant validity. The Implementation Climate Scale (ICS) was developed by our team with NIH 374 
support and has demonstrated excellent internal consistency, α = .91 (18 items, 3 items on each 375 
subscale) and  strong validity evidence.73 The ICS assesses clinicians’ shared perceptions of the 376 
policies, procedures, practices, and behaviors that are rewarded, supported, and expected to 377 
facilitate effective EBP implementation. Items are scored on a 5 -point Likert t ype scale (0=“Not at 378 
all” to 4=“To a very great extent”). The six subscales are: Focus on EBP (α=.91), Educational Support 379 
for EBP (α=.84), Recognition for EBP (α=.88), Rewards for EBP (α=.81), Selection for EBP (α=.89), and 380 
Selection for Openness (α=.91).  Social psychologists have developed measures of intention with 381 
strong psychometric properties that are meant to be adapted to any behavior of interest; 25, 114 382 
we have adapted these resulting in a 3 -item scale assessing clinician intentions to use MBC. In  383 
addition, we will modify the psychometrically validated Evidence -Based Treatment Intentions scale 384 
to assess clinicians’ specific intentions to use MBC in their practice with clients.  385 
 386 
Administration of Surveys and/or Process:  387 
The sources of data for this study will include:  388 
 389 
1) Web -based surveys ( leaders, clinicians ); 390 
2) Digital meta -data from the OQ -A system regarding the extent to which clinicians used the system  391 
for each youth ; 392 
3) Web -based or telephone surveys completed by parents/caregivers regarding their youth's service 393 
outcomes and experiences at baseline and at follow -ups if they choose this mode of administration.  394 
 395 
Web -based survey data will be collected on the secure BSU  Qualtrics site and managed by the 396 
professional data manager in BSU’s Office of Information Technology. Clinicians, leaders, and caregivers 397 
will complete the surveys at a time and location of their choosing.  398 
 399 
Telephonic survey data will be collected by tr ained research assistants supervised by the PI and Co -I and 400 
entered directly into a secure database housed on professionally -managed and password protected BSU 401 
computers. Telephone interviews will take place at times and locations that are convenient for 402 
caregivers.  403 
 404 
Members of the research team will conduct telephone , in-person or virtual  interviews in an office with 405 
the door closed. All data maintained by the research project will be coded with a unique identifying 406 
number for which the key will be separa tely stored and access limited to investig ators and shared only 407 
to the extent necessary to collect data or for required reporting purposes.  408 
 409 
Digital meta -data will be collected automatically by the secure OQ -A software system and securely 410 
uploaded to pass word protected BSU servers or computers by the PI or other member of the research 411 
team. Digital meta -data will also be coded with a unique identifying number to protect participant 412 
privacy.  413 
 414 
Data Management:  415 
Survey and questionnaire data will be collected  from leaders, clinicians, and caregivers of youth via 416 
either (a) secure web -based surveys, or (b) research administered telephone calls. Web -based survey 417 
data will be collected on the secure BSU Qualtrics site and managed by the professional data manager in 418 
BSU’s Office of Information Technology. Telephonic data will be collected by trained research assistants 419 
supervised by the PI and Postdoc/ Project Coordinator and entered directly into a secure database 420 
housed on professionally -managed secure BSU servers . All data maintained by the research project will 421 
be coded with a unique identifying number for which the key will be separately stored and access 422 
limited to investigators and shared only to the extent necessary to collect data or for required reporting 423 
purposes. Digital meta -data will be collected by the secure  OQ-A software system and securely uploaded 424 
to Boise State  servers by the PI or other member of the research team . 425 
 426 
STUDY PROCEDURES  427 
 428 
Procedures:  429 
Please refer to the “Subject Recruitment and Screening” section of the protocol for details on how we 430 
will recruit and screen potential participants.  431 
 432 
Details  of the procedure  process following enrollment for each group as follows:           433 
 434 
(1)  Following enrollment in the study and randomization at the  clinic level, all participating 435 
clinicians and first -level leaders at all participating clinics will receive initial training in the OQ -A 436 
system as well as 6 months of follow -up implementation support from the OQ -A developer. This 437 
will include an initial in-person training session plus follow -up technical support and 438 
consultation. We will ask clinicians to attend these trainings and to use the OQ -A system with 439 
their clients; however, whether or not they use the system is up to them and, in fact, the extent  440 
to which they use the system (i.e., fidelity) is one of the study outcomes. Details regarding the 441 
OQ-A system, training, and implementation support is provided below.   442 
 443 
(2) Executives, first -level leaders, and clinicians in all conditions will be asked to com plete web - 444 
based surveys to assess LOCI's effects  on organizational, leadership, and clinician outcomes. 445 
These surveys will occur a total of 5 times over 18 months (baseline, 4 -month, 8 -month, 12 - 446 
month, 18 -month) and are estimated to take 30 to 40 minutes e ach. The surveys will ask about 447 
clinicians' perceptions of their work experiences and attitudes toward and use of the OQ -A 448 
system and other evidence -based practices. Participants will be compensated for their time  (see 449 
Subject Compensation ). 450 
 451 
(3) Recruitment o f caregivers into the study for Phase 1 will begin immediately after the OQ -A 452 
training and will conclude 12 months after the training. Recruitment of caregivers into the study 453 
for Phase 2 will begin in month 13 after the initial OQ -A training and will cont inue for 12 months 454 
with caregivers recruited in month 24 followed for an additional 6 months to ensure adequate 455 
follow -up time. Caregivers will be asked to complete measures that assess their child/youth's 456 
symptoms and functioning as well as the clinicians ' use of the OQ -A system on a total of 7 457 
surveys  during a 6 month period (baseline, then monthly thereafter for 6 months). These 458 
surveys are estimated to take 10-15 minutes each and caregivers will be compensated for their 459 
time  (see Subject Compensation ).  460 
 461 
All participants receive email and phone call reminders to complete their follow up survey in 462 
order to boost study engagement and assist with technical support.  463 
 464 
Details of the OQ -A intervention:  465 
 466 
(1) The Outcomes Questionnaire – Analyst for Youth (OQ -A) is a secure, HIPAA -compliant, cloud - 467 
based digital measurement -based care software application that provides regular (e.g., weekly) 468 
feedback to clinicians about patient s’ progress in treatment. The OQ system has been tested in 469 
12 clinical trials across 4 countries (US, Netherlands, Norway, Germany) incorporating 7,882 470 
patients and has been shown to significantly improve psychotherapy outcomes with a mean 471 
effect size rela tive to treatment as usual of d = .48.  472 
 473 
(2) Each week prior to the session, caregivers (and youths, if applicable) complete brief, 474 
standardized, psychometrically validated outcome measures and treatment process measures 475 
(e.g., therapeutic alliance) on an elec tronic device (e.g., tablet or mobile phone). These digital 476 
measures are automatically scored by the software application using actuarial ‘big data’ 477 
algorithms and a feedback report is generated and delivered to the clinician within seconds. 478 
Feedback repor ts describe the youth’s progress in treatment benchmarked against data from a 479 
large population. The software issues empirically -based alerts indicating whether the youth is on 480 
track toward positive outcomes or at risk for treatment failure or dropout. Data  from the 481 
treatment process measures assesses empirically -validated predictors of treatment outcome 482 
including therapeutic alliance, motivation, self -efficacy, and social support. The OQ -A is designed 483 
to detect treatment progress regardless of treatment mod ality, diagnosis, or discipline of the 484 
clinician. It is important to note that none of the OQ -A measures completed by caregivers or 485 
youth will be used in the research; these measures will only be used to provide feedback to 486 
clinicians via the OQ -A system.  487 
 488 
(3) All clinicians in LOCI and implementation as usual will receive initial training from the OQ -A 489 
developer as well as six months of implementation support covering both clinical and technical 490 
aspects of OQ -A implementation. Following the six months of imple mentation support, all clinics 491 
will continue to have access to the online initial training and booster training and technical 492 
support from the OQ -A customer care team, which assists with technical troubleshooting and 493 
minor clinical issues for all licensees . 494 
 495 
Details of the LOCI intervention:  496 
 497 
First -level leaders and executive leaders in the LOCI condition will participate in LOCI for 12 months. 498 
There are two key features of LOCI: (1) training and coaching for first -level leaders, and (2) executive -led 499 
organ izational strategies to support the LOCI leaders and their efforts to build an implementation 500 
climate in their clinics. LOCI has six components which are described in the LOCI manual along with 501 
slides and handouts. The 6 key components of LOCI are:  502 
 503 
(1) Asses sment: LOCI is a data -driven process with leader development plans and goals based on 504 
360º assessment with the leader’s self -ratings, ratings from his/her subordinates (i.e., clinicians), 505 
and ratings from the leader’s manager/supervisor. The data are synth esized into a detailed 506 
feedback report and then used in the development of a personal development plan.  507 
 508 
(2) Initial Training: The LOCI training begins with a two -day leadership didactic and interactive 509 
session. This component includes introduction to the ful l-range leadership model, identifying 510 
transformational and transactional leadership behaviors, implementation leadership, identifying 511 
leader behaviors that can be used to build a climate for OQ -A implementation, and group 512 
activities (e.g., breakout groups,  meals) to facilitate social interaction and learning consolidation 513 
among trainees. The training also addresses implementation climate and the nature of OQ -A so 514 
that leaders can articulate a rationale for how and why use of the OQ -A system can improve 515 
client outcomes.  516 
           517 
Leadership Development Planning: During the initial training, trainers and coaches work 518 
individually with each trainee in reviewing their personalized 360º assessment data, identifying 519 
strengths and areas for development, and setti ng a timeline for issues to be addressed 520 
immediately and those to be addressed later in coaching. Leader trainees emerge with data - 521 
based development plans including broad goals and specific action items that will guide 522 
coaching sessions throughout the rema inder of the program.  523 
 524 
(3) Coaching: Brief weekly coaching calls are provided for each LOCI participant. Coaching calls 525 
range from 15 -20 minutes in duration and keep participants on track with their goals and 526 
development plans. The coach will be directly supe rvised by the developers of LOCI (Co -Is 527 
Aarons, Ehrhart). The weekly coaching calls focus on tracking the trainees’ progress in their 528 
development plans, updating the plans based on emergent issues or needs, problem solving, 529 
providing additional leadership support, and identifying organizational strategy needs. Plan -Do- 530 
Study -Act (PDSA) cycles are utilized to assess incremental progress toward measurable overall 531 
and time -limited goals. Group conference calls with leader trainees are held monthly to 532 
facilitate  problem solving and networking among LOCI participants and trainees as they discuss 533 
their progress and solutions to barriers.  534 
 535 
(4) Organizational Strategy Development: LOCI facilitators (led by Co -I Esp) meet concurrently with 536 
executive managers, middle mana gers, and LOCI trainees (within agency) during monthly 537 
meetings across the 12 month period to tailor organizational strategies to support the trainee in 538 
creating an implementation climate that supports use of the OQ -A system. This involves ongoing 539 
plan -do-study -act cycles using web -survey data to evaluate how strategies are being 540 
implemented and utilized and if adjustments are needed. As a guiding heuristic, we utilize 541 
“climate embedding mechanisms” (i.e., what leaders to do communicate that use of the OQ -A is 542 
expected, supported, and rewarded in the organization) that are tailored for OQ -A 543 
implementation for each agency and workgroup. Examples of potential strategies include mid - 544 
level managers attending workgroup meetings in support of first -level leaders, providing 545 
recognition for providers who exemplify excellence in using the OQ -A system, providing 546 
additional training for the OQ -A or other clinical approaches identified as necessary to get 547 
clients back on track, altering OQ -A feedback processes, or execut ives communications to 548 
clinicians emphasizing the importance of OQ -A in service provision.  549 
 550 
(5) Follow -up Sessions: Prior to each booster session, additional 360º assessments are completed. 551 
LOCI participants attend booster sessions at 4 and 8 months after the initial training. Leadership 552 
principles, intervention goals, and organizational strategies to support leadership are reinforced 553 
through group discussion and problem -solving. The booster sessions are considered longer term 554 
plan -do-study -act cycles in which 360º assessments are utilized to assess progress and guide 555 
modification of the leaders’ development plans.  556 
 557 
(6) Graduation: Graduation is a ritual (i.e., secondary embedding mechanism) deliberately included 558 
in LOCI to mark completion of the program. Accomplis hments of the participants are celebrated, 559 
challenges are processed, and future plans are shared.  560 
 561 
Analysis Plan:  562 
For all aims, basic data screening procedures will be conducted to screen for errors and explore 563 
normality, linearity, form, and outliers. Prior to conducting main analyses, we will examine the 564 
psychometric properties of total scales and subscales of all measures (e.g., coefficient alpha, 565 
confirmatory factor analyses) to assess the latent constructs captured by the measures and we w ill 566 
explore the bivariate associations among all variables. Data will be transformed as appropriate. We will 567 
confirm randomization validity (e.g., chi -square tests, t -tests, Kruskal -Wallis). Minor differences will be 568 
statistically controlled during model -building. We will explore for selection bias from attrition. Data 569 
missing at random will be modeled using full maximum likelihood estimation.   570 
 571 
Based on our theoretical model, we have selected generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) as our 572 
general analytic framework. GLMMs are ideal for this study because they (1) accommodate the complex 573 
nested structure of the data (e.g., youth nested in clinicians nested in clinics), (2) permit testing of cross - 574 
level Hypotheses (e.g., effects of organization -level LOCI on clinician - and youth -level outcomes), and (3) 575 
permit the specification of different functional forms to address different types of outcomes including 576 
mean differences (e.g., in clinician fidelity) as well as differences in growth rates over time (i.e., you th 577 
clinical outcomes).  Models will include  random effects addressing the nesting of repeated observations 578 
within youth and youth within clinics, as appropriate. All analyses will use an intent -to-treat approach. 579 
Hypothesis 1a will be tested using a general ized linear mixed effects model with a binomial response 580 
distribution and logit link function to address the events/trials nature of the MBC fidelity index. To 581 
facilitate interpretation, we calculated average predicted probabilities for each condition, rep resenting 582 
the adjusted average fidelity index (or completion rate) in each group. Hypothesis 1b will be tested using 583 
a linear mixed effects growth model with a  condition (LOCI vs. control) by time cross -level interaction. If 584 
a statistically significant ( P<.05) interaction is observed , simple slopes analyses will be conducted  to 585 
examine the rate of change in each condition . Models will be estimated using maximum likelihood, 586 
which accounts for missing data on the outcome under the missing at random assumption . Prior to 587 
testing Hypothesis 1b, we will use model comparison tests based on the Bayesian Information Criteria to 588 
determine the best -fitting functional form for growth  and optimal random effects structure.  589 
 590 
To address potential imbalance across clusters and to account for variables included in the constrained 591 
randomization, we  will include covariates in all analyses.  The familywise error rate for the two primary 592 
outcomes was controlled using the Benjamini -Hochberg4 procedure.  593 
 594 
Controlling for Familywise Error Rate. Across our two primary outcomes  (i.e., MBC fidelity index and 595 
change in SAC total problem score ), the Benjamini and Hochberg (1995)98 False Discovery Rate 596 
procedure will be used to correct for multiple tests, which is preferable to the overly c onservative 597 
Bonferroni correction.  598 
 599 
Power Analysis :  600 
Taking into account 25% attrition of youth and clinicians, our target enrollment is 360 youth nested 601 
within 20 behavioral health clinics (180 youth in LOCI organizations and 180 youth in IAU organizations) 602 
for Phase 1. To estimate the minimum detectable ef fect size give our sample , we assumed: (1) 360 603 
youth nested within 20 clinics, (2) an alpha level of .05 and a power level of .80, and (3) a level -3 ICC 604 
ranging from .05 to .10 for youth symptoms/ functioning based on our prior studies. Given these 605 
assumpt ions, 360 youth nested within 20 clinics is a large enough sample size to find statistically 606 
significant intervention effects of d = .44 to .53 (Cohen’s d), classically described as a medium effect.   607 
 608 
RISK/BENEFIT ASSESSMENT  609 
 610 
Risks:  611 
There  are no known ser ious health or psychological risks of participating in this study. The digital OQ -A 612 
measurement -based care system used in this s tudy represents a quality improvement intervention 613 
designed to provide clinicians with feedback about their patients’ progress i n treatment based on 614 
patients’ self -reported outcomes. The OQ -A has strong empirical support from multiple randomized 615 
trials. Patients complete an electronic survey on a tablet prior to their session, the OQ -A software 616 
automatically analyzes this data, and  provides clinicians with feedback to inform treatment decisions. 617 
The LOCI implementation strategy tested in this study represen ts an effort to strengthen the delivery of 618 
evidence -based practices for children in publicly -funded mental health clinics, with the direct 619 
intervention targeted at organizational leaders through training and consultation. The study design does 620 
not require any changes to treatment or services for any youth or family. All families will receive the 621 
usual clinical assessments and clini cal care provided by clinics.  622 
 623 
Potential risks to participants revolve primarily around potential loss of confidentiality. For the mental 624 
health professional participants (leaders/ clinicians) this relates to confidentiality regarding their 625 
practice behav iors (i.e., fidelity). Participants will be reassured that their decision to participate (or not) 626 
in the study will have no impact on their role as providers in the service settings. In addition, participants 627 
will be informed that their clinic will not hav e access to research data on clinician fidelity or client 628 
outcomes thereby eliminating the potential use of this information to evaluate clinicians’ performance.  629 
 630 
For youth and caregivers who participate, there is potential risk of loss of confidentiality  related to 631 
sensitive information provided by their caregivers in response to study outcome measures assessing 632 
child symptoms and functioning. All information obtained from participants will be held confidential 633 
unless there is a report of serious harm to a child or threat of harm to self or others. This limitation will 634 
be addressed specifically in the consent form.  635 
 636 
Subject Confidentiality:  637 
When connected only to a numeric identifier, the majority of the research data does not contain 638 
information that could identify a participant. Therefore, we will use protocols to separate personally 639 
identifying information from the research data by generat ing a numeric research identifier in all data 640 
sets. All digital meta -data, web -based survey data, and telephonic survey data will be labeled using ID 641 
numbers only and stored on secure, password protected computers and servers that are professionally 642 
protec ted and managed by BSU’s Office of Information Technology. Personally identifying information 643 
(i.e., the key that links names to ID numbers) will be stored in a single database that is located on secure 644 
servers at Boise State University and separate from t he data files. Access to this key will be restricted to 645 
authorized research personnel only and will include a password that is only known to the PI and 646 
appropriate research members.  647 
 648 
How will confidentiality of data be maintained?  649 
In addition, we will fo llow use the following procedures to ensure the confidentiality of electronic data 650 
including:  651 
 652 
(1) all computer screens will have a five -minute time limit that will produce a locked screen if left 653 
unattended and will require BSU login and password authent icaion to re -access the computer,  654 
 655 
(2) The study database will be located on the BSU computer network and will only be available to the 656 
project team. Boise State University’s Office of Information Technology stores confidential information 657 
from a multitud e of research projects, and thus, maintains stringent security measures,  658 
 659 
(3) Research data collected will be coded with a participant’s unique identifier, or number. Personally 660 
identifying data (i.e., names) will not appear on any research data,  661 
 662 
(4) Al l individuals with access to data  will sign confidentiality agreements to never disclose any individual 663 
information regarding any aspect of the study,  664 
 665 
(5) All persons working on this research project will have undergone extensive orientation and training  666 
on issues regarding the maintenance and protection of confidentiality (sending confidential material to a 667 
community printer, using names while conducting phone interviews, etc.) as well as standard training in 668 
research ethics and the protection of human s ubjects (e.g., CITI).  669 
 670 
Subject Compensation:  671 
1. Executives , first -level leaders, and clinicians will be paid for their time to complete the 5 web - 672 
based surveys. These individuals will receive a $30 for the first (baseline) survey, $30 for the 4 - 673 
month survey,  $45 for the 8 -month survey, $50 for the 12 -month survey, and $55 for 18 -month  674 
survey for this study; a total of $210 in gift cards (5 questionnaires  = $210) . The gift card will be 675 
delivered either electr onically or via mail following completion of each survey.  676 
2. Caregivers of youth will be paid for their time to complete phone or web -based surveys with 677 
researchers at baseline and once per month thereafter for up to 6 months. Caregivers will 678 
receive a $15 g ift card upon completion of each survey via either electronic mail or standard 679 
mail delivery.  680 
 681 
Data and Safety Monitoring  682 
We will convene a 3 member  DSMB  that will represent  experience and expertise in research on 683 
evidence -based practice implementation in clinical and other service settings for youth as well as 684 
methodological expertise related to the conduct of randomized tri als with vulnerable populations.  685 
 686 
The DSMB will convene annually, with ad hoc meetings to be called for by the Chair as needed. The R01 687 
staff will be responsible for scheduling these meetings and for keeping minutes of their proceedings. 688 
These minutes will be sent to each member of the DSMB for approval before their distribution to the PI 689 
and Co -Is. 690 
 691 
The PI will be responsi ble for maintaining communication with the DSMB. Members of the DSMB are 692 
not involved directly with the trial and do not have conflicts of interest with the study PI or Co -Is.  693 
 694 
The DSMB will perform several duties. First, they will review and approve the research protocol and 695 
plans for data and safety monitoring prior to study commencement. Second, they will evaluate the 696 
progress of the trial. This will include assessment of participant recruitment and accrual, occurrence of 697 
adverse events, and study outco mes. This assessment will be performed at meetings every 12 months 698 
during the trial and more frequently, if decided by the DSMB. The PI will be responsible for responding 699 
to all recommendations of the DSMB and submitting DSMB reports to the Boise State Uni versity IRB and 700 
NIMH.  701 
 702 
Risk / Benefit Assessment:  703 
Clinic  executives, first -level leaders, and clinicians will benefit from the study by receiving access to 704 
training and digital health technology that they can use to more effectively measure and monitor th e 705 
progress of their clients in treatment. Clinical staff will receive continuing  education credits for 706 
completion of training activities which will be provided free of charge. These resources will improve 707 
clinicians' and clinics' ability to effectively ser ve clients and are of value to clinicians because continuing 708 
education credits can be used to satisfy licensing requirements.   709 
 710 
Caregivers of youth who participate in this study may benefit from receiving more effective services and 711 
from the opportunity t o provide feedback to clinicians about their child's progress during treatment.  712 
 713 
Leaders and clinics that participate in LOCI will benefit from receiving free leadership training and 714 
organizational consultation to improve the implementation of evidence -based practices in their 715 
organizations which may improve the overall leadership ability of participating leaders as well as the 716 
functioning of the clinic and the overall work environment.  717 
 718 
INFORMED CONSENT PROCESS  719 
 720 
Informed Consent:  721 
Please refer to the “Subject Recruitment and Screening” section of the protocol for details on how we  722 
will recruit and screen potential participants.  723 
 724 
This project involves four different groups of participants: (A) clinic executives, first -level clinic leaders, 725 
clinicians, a nd (B) parent/ caregivers of youth who are served by participating clinicians. Informed 726 
consent procedures will be as follows for these groups:  727 
 728 
A. Clinic Executives, first -level leaders, and clinicians -  After obtaining permission from clinic executives 729 
for their clinic to participate in the study (as described above), we will introduce the study to first -level 730 
leaders and clinicians (ideally during standing staff meetings) and ask them to participate by sending an 731 
email via BSU Qualtrics that includes a information about the study and a link to the consent form and 732 
survey at baseline, 4 months, 8 months, 12 months, and 18 months (see recruitment and screening) :  733 
 734 
1) Each time an executive, first -level leader, or clinician completes a web -based survey for the study, the 735 
survey will include an introductory page that reminds them of their rights as participants in the study 736 
and the voluntary nature of participation.  Respondents will indicate they are willing to complete the 737 
assessments by clicking "AGREE" to  continue to the assessments.  738 
 739 
There will be no consequences for clinicians who choose not to participate in the study. Clinicians will be 740 
assured that choosing to participate or not participate in the research will in no way affect their 741 
employment. All clinicians will be free to withd raw their participation at any time.   742

B. Caregivers of youth served by participating clinics -  Caregivers will be consented in a multistep and 744 
ongoing process by a member of the research team (i.e., Postdoc, Research Associate, PI, Co -I Esp, 745 
graduate re search assistant):  746 
 747 
 (1) If a caregiver indicates they agree to be contacted by a member of the research team by selecting 748 
“YES” on the cover letter and sharing their contact information , a member of the research team will 749 
contact the caregiver via phone . During this call, the research team member will first review the study 750 
parameters with the caregiver (following a script) and obtain verbal consent that the caregiver wishes to 751 
participate in the study. The research team member will document this by signi ng a form indicating the 752 
caregiver provided verbal consent.  753 
 754 
(2) At each subsequent contact with caregivers (total of 7 contacts over 6 months), caregivers will be 755 
reminded of their rights as research participants and will indicate they are willing to com plete the 756 
assessments. This process will be completed via either (a) an electronic cover page on web -based 757 
surveys in which caregivers must indicate they consent to participate by clicking "AGREE" to continue to 758 
the assessments , or (b) a telephone conversa tion with the researcher in which the caregiver verbally 759 
indicates he or she is willing to complete the assessments.  760 
 761 
Documented consent will be secured prior to the initiation of study participation. Parents/caregivers 762 
whose preferred language is Spanish  will be contacted by a member of the research team who can 763 
review the study parameters and obtain verbal consent in Spanish. In addition, the web -based 764 
survey/assessment will be available in English and Spanish.  765

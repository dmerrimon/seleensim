Section s 
2.0 and 
4.2 This trial will be conducted at a single trial center s in the United States of 
America (USA)  using a pre existing pool of  involving healthy adults who are 
either flavivirus -naïve or seropositive for DENV -1 or DENV -3 (ie, serology 
consistent with primary in fection with either DENV -1 or DENV -3). The 
serological status of subjects will either has have been determined by the trial 
center prior to and outside the scope of this trial  or will be determined through 
screening within the scope of this trial . 
Sections 
2.0, 6.1 This is an open -label , phase 2 trial in 40 44 healthy adult subjects aged 18 to 60 
years (inclusive) to investigate the immunogenicity and safety of SC 
administration of a 2 -dose regimen of TDV . 
Subjects will be enrolled in 2 trial groups based on results from serological 
testing performed either  by the trial center s prior to and  outside the scope of 
this trial or through screening within the scope of this trial  (up to 35 days 
[5 weeks] prior to Day 1[M0]):  
-Group 1: approximately 20 22 flavivirus -naïve subjects.
-Group 2: approximately 20 22 dengue -immune subjects (ie,
approximately 10 11 subjects with serology consistent with primary
infection by DENV -1 and approximately 10 11 subjects with serology
consistent with primary infection by DENV -3).
All subjects wi ll be followed -up for 9 months post second vaccination so the 
trial duration will be approximately 360 days (12 months) or 13 months for 
each subject  depending on whether serological testing with regard to the 
inclusion criteria for the trial is performed outside or within the scope of this 
trial, respectively .

therapy within 6  months prior to Day 1 (M0). Concomitant medication/vaccination will be collected throughout 
the trial.  
(g) (e) Physical examination including measurement of weight and height; Body Mass Index (BMI) will be calculat ed.
Measurement of height is only required at Screening or at  Day 1 (M0) , as applicable . 
(h) (f) Subjects may undergo a targeted symptom -directed physical examination. Clinically significant changes from
the Baseline examination should be recorded in the subje ct’s source documents and electronic Case Report Form
(eCRF).
(i) (g) Vital signs including (but not limited to) the measurement of systolic blood pressure/diastolic blood pressure,
heart rate, and body temperature.
(j) (h) Pregnancy testing (serum or urine) for f emales of childbearing potential. Results must be confirmed and 
documented as negative prior to each trial dose administration. Additional pregnancy tests may be performed
during the trial if deemed necessary by the investigator.
(k) (i) Females of childbearin g potential who are sexually active will be reminded during trial visits to adhere to 
acceptable contraceptive methods up to 6 weeks after the last dose of TDV (Day  90 [Month 3] (M3]) + 6 weeks).
Subjects will be provided with information on acceptable met hods of contraception as part of the subject informed
consent process and will be asked to sign a consent form stating that they understand the requirements for 
avoidance of pregnancy and donation of ova. During the course of the trial, subjects of childbe aring potential will
receive continued guidance with respect to the avoidance of pregnancy.
(l) (j) All blood samples on days of vaccination (Day 1 [M0] and Day 90 [M3]) should be taken prior to 
administration of TDV.
(m) (k) Dengue neutralizing antibodies and anti -dengue Non -Structural protein 1 (NS1) antibodies for all subjects, and

local (injection site) reactions for 7 days (day of administration + 6 days) and solicited systemic events for 14 days
(day of administration + 13 days) following administration of each  trial vaccine dose, and 2) unsolicited AE for 28
days (day of administration +  27 days) following administration of each trial vaccine dose. The investigator will 
categorize events by severity (mild, moderate or severe) and will assess causality to vaccin e administration
(“related” or “not related”). For persistent/prolonged solicited local (injection site) reactions or systemic events
observed as continuing on Day 8 or 15, respectively, following each trial vaccination, the end date will be captured
on th e “Adverse Event” eCRF to permit a separate analysis from the unsolicited AEs. Any solicited local (injection
site) reaction or systemic event that resolves before 8 or 15 days, respectively, following each trial vaccination, but
recurs at a later time (ie , if discontinues), should be recorded as an unsolicited AE on the “Adverse Event ” eCRF.
(q) (o) MAAEs and SAEs will be collected for the trial duration.
(r) (p) The Final Visit will be performed on Day 360 (Month 12 [M12]). If a subject terminates trial participa tion

1.3.2 Summary of Changes  
Amendment to Protocol Version 2.0 dated 23 January 2019 
Rationale for the Amendment:  
This protocol has been amended because  incidence estimates of dengue among travelers 
indicates that although the incidence rate is variable (due to the multifactorial nature of 
dengue transmission in endemic countries ), overall, the risk of dengue transmission among 
travelers is considered to be low  (1-4). As a result, the criterion #22 that excludes subjects 
from participating in the trial based on planned travel to dengue endemic countries during 
the conduction of the trial has been removed . Removal of this exclusion criteria is expected 
to address, at least to some extent, the slow enrollment rate experienced in the trial . 
In addition, the screening window for subjects screened within the scope of this trial has 
been  increased  to 70 days (1 0 weeks) to allow enrollment of subjects falling outside the 
previous defined screening window  of 35 days (5  weeks) .

1.3.2 Summary of Changes  
1.Amendment to Protocol Version 3.0 dated 06 December  2019
2.Rationale for the Amendment:
3.This protocol  amendment  is due to  the slow enrollment rate experienced in the trial for
Group 2 (DENV -1 or DENV -3 positive subjects) while complete enrollment of the
planned number of subjects in Group  1 (flavivirus -negative subjects) has been achieved
(n=22) . Group 2 would create a subject population potentially eligible for inclusion in a
future DENV -1/DENV -3 human challenge trial. Since Group 1 is considered a key
group for the characterization of immune responses  to Takeda’s Tetravalent Dengue
Vaccine Candidate  (TDV)  (primary an d secondary trial objectives), it was decided to
stop the recruitment of subjects in Group  2. As a result, the criterion that excludes
subjects from participating in the trial based on planned travel to dengue endemic
countries during the conduc t of the tr ial which was removed from Protocol Version 3.0
dated 06 December 2019 is reinstated  since 1) removal of this criterion was previously
done to facilitate enrollment of subjects in Group  2, and 2) travel to dengue endemic
regions is undesirable for subjects  in Group  1 and Group  2. As the criterion of
authorized travel  to dengue endemic countries  is no longer included, recording of the
travel history and planned trips  to any country  is no longer necessary .
4.Protocol Version 3.0 dated 06 December 2019 has not been submitted to any
Institutional  Review Boards .
5.Other modifications:
–Administrative change
–Correction in the unit for the non-structural protein 1 (NS1)  antibody test result.
–Removal of reference to the Procedures Manua l as it is not applicable for the trial.
–A minor editorial change is included for consistency purposes only .
–Update of literature list

1.3.2 Summary of Changes  
Amendment to Protocol Version 4.0 dated 11 March 2020  
Rationale for the Amendment:  
This protocol amendment is to remove the planned interim analysis due to  the short time 
period between the projected dates for the database lock for the interim analysis (March 
2021 ) and final analysis (August 2021 ). The interim  analysis would have provide d safety 
and immunogenicity data when all subjects have completed the Day  120 (M4) visit. Given 
the anticipated timing of the database lock for both analyses, it is consi dered that the 
interim analysis is no longer needed.  
Other modification s: 
 Addition of a clarification that , due to the COVID -19 pandemic,  alternative monitoring 
approaches may be used.  
 Addition of a clarification that some of the test results may not be av ailable prior to 
database lock because trial laboratory procedures are not carried out during the 
COVID -19 pandemic . 
 Following modifications were made for alignment with protocol template Version 4.0:  
- Update in responsibilities of the Signatory Investigator.  
- Addition of trial risk management.  
 Administrative change  
 Few m inor editorial change s.

Note: When a site visit cannot be carried out due to the COVID -19 
pandemic, telephone contacts will be made for subjects who are still under 
monitor ing for safety reporting . 
3.2 The sponsor will select a Signatory Principal Investigator from the 
investigators who participate in the trial . Selection criteria for  this the 
Principal iInvestigator will include significant knowledge of the trial protocol, 
the investigational vaccine, their expertise in the therapeutic area and the 
conduct of clinical research as well as trial participation. Takeda will select a 
Signatory Investigator from the investigators who participate in the trial. 
The Signatory Principal Investigator will be required to review and sign the 
clinical protocol. The Signatory Investigator will also be required to review 
and sign the cClinical sStudy rReport (CSR)  and by doing so agrees that it 
accurately describes the results of the trial.

13.1 A Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) will be prepared and finalized prior to the 
planned interim analysis  database lock . This document will provide further 
details regarding the definition of analysis variables and analysis methodology 
to address all trial objectives.  
Data reviews will be conducted prior to the planned interim analysis and final  
analysis  database lock . These reviews will assess the accuracy and 
completeness of the trial databas e, and subject evaluability , and appropriateness 
of the planned statistical methods . 
As trial laboratory procedures are not carried out during the COVID -19 
pandemic there is a possibility  that not all pre -defined test  results  will be 
available prior to database lock. Thus, there is a risk for  database 
unlock/relock and additional data may be added in CSR amendments or 
addend a to the final CSR . 
13.2 An interim analysis of immunogenicity and safety data is planned when all 
subjects have completed the Day 120 (M4) visit.  
No interim analysis is planned.  
14.0 14.1 Trial -Site Monitoring Visits  
In the event a monitor cannot visit the site in a timely manner due to the 
COVID -19 pandemic, alternative monitoring approaches such as remote 
source data ver ification (SDV) or telephone contact may be used to ensure 
data quality and integrity and maintain subject  safety. Alternative monitoring 
approaches should be used only where allowed by the local Health Authority 
and when approved  by the IRB/IEC.  During re mote monitoring, the monitor 
should focus on trial activities that are essential to the safety of trial subjec ts 
and/or data reliability.  
14.4 Trial Risk Management  
The ICH E6 addendum (R2) guidance encourages a risk -based approach to 
the management of clinical trials and includes requirements for risk control 
and risk reporting. Takeda or designee established Quality Tolerance Limits 
(QTL) taking into consideration t he medical and statistical characteristics of 
the variables and the statistical design of the trial. This process was 
performed according to Takeda internal procedures.  
At the end of the trial, the quality management approach implemented will be 
described in the CSR. If applicable, the CSR will summarize important 
deviations from the predefined QTL and the remedial actions taken .

Takeda’s Tetravalent Dengue Vaccine Candidate (TDV)  
Trial Title:  An Open -Label, Phase 2 Trial to Investigate the Humoral and Cell -Mediated Immune Responses 
and Safety of a Tetravalent Dengue Vaccine Candidate (TDV) Administered Subcutaneously in Flavivirus -
Naïve and Dengue -Immune Healthy Adults  
IND No.:  014292  EudraCT No.: Not applicable  
Trial Identifier:  DEN -210 Phase:  2 Blinding Schema:  Open Label  
Indication: Prevention of dengue fever of any severity due to any serotype.  
Background and Rationale:  
Dengue fever is caused by infection with the wild type dengue virus (DENV), a ribonucleic acid virus that 
occurs as 4 recognized serotypes, DENV -1, DENV -2, DENV -3, or DENV -4. These 4 DENVs are 
transmitted to humans by mosquitoes (primarily Aedes aegypti ), and are endemic in Asia, Central and South 
America, the Caribbean, the Pacific Islands, and parts of Africa. There are an estimated 390 million dengue 
infections per year worldwide, which is close to 4 times the previous World Health Organization (WHO) 
estimate of 50 to 100  million cases. Every year, around 500,000 cases of Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever (DHF) 
require hospitalization with an estimated death rate of 2.5%, primarily in children . It is estimated that 
3.9 billion people are at risk of dengue infectio n. 
Dengue fever is clinically defined as an acute febrile illness with 2 or more of the following manifestations: 
headache, retro -orbital pain, myalgia, arthralgia, rash, hemorrhagic manifestations, or leukopenia, and 
occurrence at the same location and ti me as other confirmed cases of dengue fever. The most severe forms of 
dengue infection – DHF and Dengue Shock Syndrome (DSS) – are life threatening. Primary infection with 
any one of the 4 dengue serotypes is thought to result in life -long protection from re-infection by the same 
serotype but does not protect against a secondary infection by one of the other 3 dengue serotypes which 
may lead to an increased risk of severe disease (DHF/DSS).  
Treatment of dengue fever is based solely on medical management of signs and symptoms, with fluid 
replacement required for hemorrhagic or shock cases. An antiviral therapy for DENV infection is not 
available at this time. Preventive measures that rely on mosquito control and individual protection are of 
limited efficacy, complex to implement and questionable in terms of cost -effectiveness. There is a great 
unmet global public health need for a safe and effective vaccine to reduce the morbidity and mortality 
associated with dengue disease. Vaccine development has focused on  tetravalent vaccines that provide 
protection against all 4 dengue serotypes simultaneously since all 4 dengue serotypes commonly co -circulate 
in endemic areas.  A first dengue vaccine ( Chimeric Yellow fever virus Dengue virus -Tetravalent Dengue 
Vaccine  [CYD-TDV]) has been approved (year 2015) in some countries in Asia and Latin America. Initial 
findings showed that  vaccine efficacy was different between serotypes and depended on dengue pre -
exposure status. Additionally, recent analyses found that people who  had not been infected by dengue virus 
before vaccination had a higher risk of getting severe disease when they were infected with dengue virus 
after vaccination with CYD -TDV. Hence, there is a continued unmet public health need for safer and more 
efficaci ous dengue vaccines . 
Takeda’s Tetravalent Dengue Vaccine Candidate (TDV) - Background:  
Takeda’s TDV  consists of 1 molecularly characterized, attenuated dengue serotype 2 virus strain and 
3 chimeric recombinant dengue virus strains expressing surface antige ns corresponding to DENV serotypes 
1– 4. The dengue serotype 2 strain (TDV -2) is based upon the attenuated laboratory -derived DENV -2 virus 
strain, originally isolated at Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand and generated by 53 serial passages in 
Primary Dog Kidney (PDK) cells (DENV -2 PDK -53). The chimeric, attenuated vaccine strains for dengue 
serotypes 1, 3 and  4 were engineered by substituting the structural genes, pre -Membrane (prM) and 
Envelope  (E), of TDV -2 with the  prM and E genes of the DENV virus s trains, DENV -1 16007, 
DENV - 3 16562 or DENV -4 1036 virus, respectively. Thus, TDV is comprised of 4 dengue virus strains: 
a molecularly characterized, attenuated dengue serotype  2 strain (TDV -2), a dengue serotypes 2/1 chimeric

CONFIDENTIAL  strain (TDV -1), a dengue ser otypes 2/3 chimeric strain (TDV -3), and a dengue serotypes 2/4 chimeric strain 
(TDV -4). 
Nonclinical studies carried out in mice and nonhuman primates have demonstrated an acceptable safety, 
immunogenicity, and efficacy profile of Takeda’s TDV . Additionally , data from completed phase 1 and 
phase  2 clinical trials in humans have shown satisfactory reactogenicity, safety and immunogenicity profiles 
of Takeda’s TDV in healthy adults in nonendemic areas as well as in healthy adults and children in endemic 
areas in Asia and Latin America. Ongoing and completed phase 2 clinical trials have enabled the selection of 
a final TDV dose (lyophilized formulation), and a 2 -dose vaccination regimen (2 single doses) administered 
3 months (ie, 90 days) apart by subcutaneous ( SC) injection for use in the ongoing pivotal program.  
The current Investigator’s Brochure contains additional product information and a more detailed review of 
nonclinical studies and clinical trials.  
Rationale for the Proposed Trial:  
The purpose of this trial is to characterize the magnitude, quality, and evolution over time of humoral and 
cell-mediated immune responses to TDV when administered as a 2 -dose vaccination regimen (2 single doses 
3 months [ie, 90 days] apart). Furthermore, this trial aims to characterize the relationships between 
TDV - specific innate, humoral and cellular immune responses. This characterization will aid in the 
understanding of vaccine efficacy and in the identification of potential determinants for protectio n against all 
4 dengue serotypes in the ongoing phase  3 TDV clinical program. This trial will be conducted at trial centers 
in the United States of America involving healthy adults who are either flavivirus -naïve or seropositive for 
DENV -1 or DENV -3 (ie, s erology consistent with primary infection with either DENV -1 or DENV -3). The 
serological status of subjects will either ha ve been determined by the trial center prior to and outside the 
scope of this trial or will be determined through screening within the  scope of this trial . 
Although certain parameters of TDV -specific humoral and cell -mediated immune responses have been 
evaluated to some extent in phase 1 and other phase 2 clinical trials with TDV, the present trial is the only one 
that will allow a comprehensive analysis of TDV -specific humoral, T cell -mediated, B cell -mediated, innate, 
and early immune responses. In particular, these responses following 2 doses of TDV in both flavivirus -naïve 
and dengue -immune adults have not been evaluated yet in a ny other single trial in the TDV clinical program.  
Furthermore, conduct of the present trial would create a subject population, potentially eligible for inclusion 
in a future DENV -1/DENV -3 human challenge trial. Such a trial may be considered at a later da te by the 
sponsor if deemed appropriate to further guide TDV development.  
The present trial will be conducted in accordance with the protocol, International Council for Harmonization 
of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use ( ICH) and Good Clinical Practice ( GCP ) 
Guidelines, and applicable regulatory requirements . 
Trial Design:  
This is an open -label, phase 2 trial in 4 4 healthy adult subjects aged 18 to 60 years (inclusive) to investigate 
the immunogenicity and safety of SC administrat ion of a 2 -dose regimen of TDV.  
Subjects will be enrolled in 2 trial groups based on results from serological testing performed either by the 
trial cent er prior to and outside  the scope of this trial or through screening within the scope of this trial  (up to 
70 days [ 10 weeks] prior to Day 1 [Month 0 (M0)]):  
- Group 1: approximately 2 2 flavivirus -naïve subjects.  
- Group 2: approximately 2 2 dengue -immune subjects (ie, subjects with serology consistent with 
primary infection by DENV -1 and subjects with serology consistent with primary infection by 
DENV -3). 
Note: The actual number of subjects in Group 2 will be lower than the planned 22 subjec ts as it was decided 
to stop the recruitment of subjects in Group 2 . 
TDV will be administered on Day 1 (M0) and on Day 90 (Month 3 [M3]) in both Groups 1 and 2.  
The blood sampling schedule is summarized in  Figure 2.a. In compliance with the National Institutes of 
Health guidance, the total amount of blood that will be drawn from trial participants over an 8 -week period 
will not exceed 10.5 mL/kg or 550 mL (whichever is smaller).  
All subjects will be followed -up for 9 months post second vaccination so the trial duration will be 
approximately 360 days (12 months) or 14.5 months for each subject depending on whether serological 
testing with regard to the in clusion criteria for the trial is performed outside or within the scope of this trial, 
respectively . The trial schedule  is presented in  Figure 2.a.

CONFIDENTIAL  Criteria for delay of vaccination : 
After enrollment, subjects may encounter clinical circumstances that warrant a delay in the administration of 
trial vaccine. These situations are listed below. In the event that a subject meets a criterion for delay of trial 
vaccine administration, the sub ject may receive the trial vaccine once the window for delay has passed as 
long as the subject is otherwise eligible for trial participation.  
If any of the conditions below occur at the time scheduled for the second TDV administration  
(Day  90 [M3]), the se cond dose may be administered at a later date as long as the subject is otherwise 
eligible to continue trial participation. In certain situations, the period of delay may lead to deviation from 
the time window for the second dose at Day 90 (M3). The decisi on to vaccinate in those situations will be 
made by the investigator.  
The following clinical circumstances warrant a delay for administration of the vaccination (consider whether 
applicable as criterion for delay of trial vaccine administration or an exclu sion criterion, see above):  
 Subjects with a clinically active significant infection (as assessed by the investigator) or body 
temperature ≥38°C (100.4°F) within 3 days of the intended date of vaccination.  
 Subjects who have received any other vaccines within 14 days (for inactivated vaccines) or 28 days (for 
live vaccines) prior to enrollment in this trial or who are planning to receive any vaccine within 28 days 
of trial vaccine administration.  
 Known or suspected altered or impaired immune function as specified under the exclusion criteria.  
 Subjects who have used antipyretics and/or analgesic medications within 24 hours prior to vaccination. 
The reason for their use (prophylaxis versus treatment) must be documented. Trial vaccine 
administration should b e delayed to allow for a full 24  hours to have passed between having used 
antipyretics and/or analgesic medications and trial vaccine administration.  
Criteria for contraindication to vaccination at Day 90 (M3):  
There are also circumstances under which rece ipt of the second trial vaccine dose at Day 90 (M3) is 
contraindicated in this trial. These circumstances include but are not limited to anaphylaxis or severe 
hypersensitivity reactions following the first TDV vaccination at Day 1 (M0). If these reactions occur, the 
subject must not receive the TDV vaccination at Day 90 (M3) but will be encouraged to continue trial 
participation for safety follow -up. 
Trial Vaccine:  
The investigational vaccine is Takeda’s TDV, a tetravalent dengue vaccine comprised of 1 molecularly 
characterized, attenuated dengue virus strain, and 3 chimeric dengue virus strains with potencies of not less 
than 3.3, 2.7, 4.0, and 4.5 log 10 plaque forming units per dose of TDV -1, TDV -2, TDV -3, and TDV -4, 
respectively.  
Route of administrati on: SC route  
Duration of the Trial and Subject Participation:  
The trial duration for each subject will be at least approximately 360 days (12  months) including vaccination 
(Day  1 [M0] and Day 90 [M3]) and follow -up through Day 360 (M12). This duration will be approximately 
14.5 months if serological testing with rega rd to the inclusion criteria for the trial is performed within the 
scope of this trial (ie, up to 70 days [ 10 weeks] prior to Day  1 [M0]).  
Criteria for Evaluation and Analyses:

CONFIDENTIAL  4.0 INTRODUCTION  
4.1 Background  
Dengue fever is caused by infection with the wild type dengue virus (DENV), a ribonucleic acid 
virus that occurs as 4 recognized serotypes, DENV -1, DENV -2, DENV -3, or DENV -4. These 
4 DENVs are transmitted to humans by mosquitoes (primarily Aedes aegypti ), and are endemic 
in Asia, Central and South America, the Caribbean, the Pacific Islands, and parts of Africa. 
There are an estimated 390 million dengue infections per year worldwide, which is close to 
4 times the previous World Health Organization (WHO) est imate of 50 to 100 million cases. 
Every year, around 500,000 cases of Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever (DHF) require hospitalization 
with an estimated death rate of 2.5%, primarily in children . It is estimated that 3.9 billion people 
are at risk of dengue infectio n [3-6]. 
Dengue fever is clinically defi ned as an acute febrile illness with 2 or more of the following 
manifestations: headache, retro -orbital pain, myalgia, arthralgia, rash, hemorrhagic 
manifestations, or leukopenia, and occurrence at the same location and time as other confirmed 
cases of den gue fever. The most severe forms of dengue infection – DHF and Dengue Shock 
Syndrome (DSS) – are life threatening. Primary infection with any one of the 4 dengue serotypes 
is thought to result in life -long protection from re -infection by the same serotype but does not 
protect against a secondary infection by one of the other 3 dengue serotypes which may lead to 
an increased risk of severe disease (DHF/DSS) [ 5-8]. 
Treatment of dengue fever is based solely on medical management of signs and symptoms, with 
fluid replacement required for hemorrhagic or shock cases. An antiviral therapy for DENV 
infection is not available at this time. Preventive measures that rely on mosquito control and 
individual protection are of limited efficacy, complex to implement and questionable in terms of 
cost-effectiveness . There is a great unmet global public health need for a safe and effective 
vaccine to reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with dengue disease. Vaccine 
development has focused on tetravalent vaccines that provide protection against all 4 dengue 
serotypes simultaneously since all 4 dengue serotypes commonly co -circulate in endemic 
areas  [3-9]. A first dengue vaccine ( Chimeric Yellow fever virus Dengue virus -Tetravalent 
Dengue Vaccine  [CYD -TDV]) has been approved (year 2015) in some countries in Asia and 
Latin America  [10]. Initial findings showed that vaccine efficacy was different between 
serotypes and depended on dengue pre -exposure status  [11]. Additionally, recent analyses found 
that people who had not been infected by dengue virus before vaccination had a higher risk of 
getting severe disease when they were infected with dengue virus after vaccination with 
CYD - TDV  [12]. Hence, there is a continued unmet public health need for safer and more 
efficacious dengue vaccines  [13]. 
Takeda’s Tetravalent Dengue Vaccine Candidate (TDV) - Background:  
Takeda’s TDV  consists of 1 molecularly characterized, attenuated dengue serotyp e 2 virus strain 
and 3 chimeric recombinant dengue virus strains expressing surface antigens corresponding to 
DENV serotypes 1 –4. The dengue serotype 2 strain (TDV -2) is based upon the attenuated 
laboratory -derived DENV -2 virus strain, originally isolated at Mahidol University, Bangkok,

CONFIDENTIAL  Thailand and generated by 53 serial passages in Primary Dog Kidney (PDK) cells 
(DENV - 2 PDK - 53) [ 14]. The chimeric, attenuated vaccine strains for dengue serotypes 1, 3 
and 4 were engineered by substituting the structural genes, pre -Membrane (prM) and 
Envelope  (E), of TDV -2 with the prM and E genes of the DENV vir us strains, DENV -1 16007, 
DENV - 3 16562 or DENV -4 1036 virus, respectively [ 15, 16]. Thus, TDV is comprised of 
4 dengue virus strains: a molecularly characterized, attenuated dengue serotype 2 strain (TDV -2), 
a dengue serotypes  2/1 chimeric strain (TDV -1), a dengue serotypes 2/3 chimeric strain 
(TDV -3), and a dengue serotypes 2/4 chimeric strain (TDV -4). 
Nonclinical studies carried out in mice and nonhuman primates have demonstrated an acceptable 
safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy profile of Takeda’s TDV . Additionally, data from 
completed phase 1 and phase 2 clinical trials i n humans have shown satisfactory reactogenicity, 
safety and immunogenicity profiles of Takeda’s TDV in healthy adults in nonendemic areas as 
well as in healthy adults and children in endemic areas in Asia and Latin America. Ongoing and 
completed phase 2 cl inical trials have enabled the selection of a final TDV dose (lyophilized 
formulation), and a 2 -dose vaccination regimen (2 single doses) administered 3 months 
(ie, 90 days) apart by subcutaneous (SC) injection for use in the ongoing pivotal program.  
The current IB contains additional product information and a more detailed review of nonclinical 
studies and clinical trials.  
4.2 Rationale for the Proposed Trial  
The purpose of this trial is to characterize the magnitude, quality, and evolution over time of 
humoral and cell -mediated immune responses to TDV when administered as a 2 -dose 
vaccination regimen (2 single doses 3  months [ie, 90 days] apart). Furthermore, this trial aims to 
characterize the relationships between TDV -specific innate, humoral and cellul ar immune 
responses. This characterization will aid in the understanding of vaccine efficacy and in the 
identification of potential determinants for protection against all 4 dengue serotypes in the 
ongoing phase  3 TDV clinical program. This trial will be c onducted at trial centers in the United 
States of America involving healthy adults who are either flavivirus -naïve or seropositive for 
DENV -1 or DENV -3 (ie, serology consistent with primary infection with either DENV -1 or 
DENV -3). The serological status of  subjects will either ha ve been determined by the trial center 
prior to and outside the scope of this trial or will be determined through screening within the 
scope of this trial . 
Although certain parameters of TDV -specific humoral and cell -mediated immune  responses have 
been evaluated to some extent in phase 1 and other phase 2 clinical trials with TDV, the present 
trial is the only one that will allow a comprehensive analysis of TDV -specific humoral, T cell -
mediated, B cell -mediated, innate, and early imm une responses. In particular, these responses 
following 2 doses of TDV in both flavivirus -naïve and dengue -immune adults have not been 
evaluated yet in any other single trial in the TDV clinical program.  Furthermore , conduct of the 
present trial would crea te a subject population, potentially eligible for inclusion in a future 
DENV -1/DENV -3 human challenge trial. Such a trial may be considered at a later date by the 
sponsor if deemed appropriate to further guide TDV development.

CONFIDENTIAL  6.0 TRIAL DESIGN AND DESCRIPTION  
6.1 Trial Design  
This is an open -label, phase 2 tri al in 44 healthy adult subjects aged 18 to 60 years (inclusive) to 
investigate the immunogenicity and safety of SC administration of a 2 -dose regimen of TDV . 
Subjects will be enrolled in 2 trial groups based on results from serological testing performed 
either by the trial center prior to and outside the scope of this trial or through screening within 
the scope of this trial  (up to 70 days [ 10 weeks]  prior to Day  1[M0]):  
- Group 1: approximately 2 2 flavivirus -naïve subjects.  
- Group 2: approximately 2 2 dengue -immune subjects (ie, subjects with serology 
consistent with primary infection by DENV -1 and subjects with serology consistent with 
primary infection by DENV -3). 
Note: The actual number of subjects in Group 2 will be lower than the planned 22 subject s as it 
was decided to  stop the recruitment of subjects in Group 2 . 
TDV will be administered on Day 1 (M0) and on Day 90 (M3) in both Groups 1 and 2.  
The blood sampling schedule is summarized in  Figure  6.a and Table  2.a. In compliance with the 
National Institutes of Health guidance, the total amount of blood that will be drawn from trial 
participants over an 8 -week period will not exceed 10.5  mL/kg or 550 mL (whichever is smaller) 
[17]. 
All subjects will be fo llowed -up for 9 months post second vaccination so the trial duration will 
be approximately 360 days (12 months) or 14.5 months for each subject depending on whether 
serological testing with regard to the inclusion criteria for the trial is performed outsid e or within 
the scope of this trial , respectively . 
A schematic of the trial design is included as  Figure  6.a. A schedule of trial procedures is 
provided in Section 2.1.

subjects pre first vac cination (Day 1 [M0]) and on Day 30 (M1); pre  second vaccination 
(Day  90 [M3]) and on Days 10 5, 120 (M4), 180 (M6), 270 (M9), and 360  (M12).  
 T cell epitopes will be mapped using blood samples collected from all subjects pre first 
vaccination (Day 1 [M0]) a nd on Days 15, 30 (M1), and 60 (M2); pre second vaccination 
(Day  90 [M3]) and on Days 10 5, 120 (M4), 150 (M5), 180 (M6), 270 (M9), and 360  (M12).  
 Anti-dengue NS1 antibodies will be measured using blood samples collected from all 
subjects pre first vaccinat ion (Day 1 [M0]) and on Days 15, 30 (M1), and 60  (M2); 
pre second vaccination (Day 90 [M3]) and on Days 10 5, 120 (M4), 150  (M5), 180  (M6),

CONFIDENTIAL   The innate immune response will be measured using blood samples collected from all 
subjects pre first vaccination (Day 1 [M0]) and on Days 4 and  6; pre second vaccination 
(Day  90 [M3]) and on Days 94 and 96. 
Safety evaluation s: 
 Diary cards (paper or electronic) will be distributed for the recording of:  
- Solicited AEs:  
- Solicited local (injection site) reactions for 7 days following administration of each 
trial vaccine dose on Day  1 (M0) and Day 90 (M3) (day of administration + 6 days). 
These will include: injection site pain, injection site erythema, and injection site 
swelling . 
- Solicited systemic  events for 14 days following administration of each trial vaccine 
dose on Day  1 (M0) and Day 90 (M3) (day of administration + 13 days). These will 
include: fever, headache, asthenia, malaise, and myalgia . 
- Unsolicited AEs for 28 days following administrati on of each trial vaccine dose on 
Day 1 (M0) and Day  90 (M3) (day of administration + 27 days ). 
 SAEs, MAAEs, and AEs leading to trial vaccine withdrawal or trial discontinuation will be 
collected for the trial duration. MAAEs are defined as AEs leading to a n unscheduled 
medical visit to or by a healthcare professional including visits to an emergency department, 
but not fulfilling seriousness criteria.  
Vaccine viremia evaluation:  
 Vaccine viremia will be measured using blood samples collected from all subject s pre first 
vaccination (Day  1 [M0]) and on Days 6, 9, 12, 15, and 30 (M1); pre second vaccination 
(Day  90 [M3]) and on Days 9 6, 99, 102, 105, and 120 (M4) . 
Data collection will be by electronic Case Report Form (eCRF).  
6.2 Justification for Trial Design, Dose, and Endpoints  
The trial design and the collection of solicited AEs  (local [injection site] reactions and systemic 
events) , unsolicited AEs (non -serious AEs and SAEs), and MAAEs following trial dose 
administration are consistent with vaccine evaluatio n trials.  
Ongoing and completed phase 2 trials have enabled the selection of a final TDV dose 
(lyophilized formulation) and a 2 -dose vaccination regimen 3 months apart by SC injection for 
use in Takeda’s dengue pivotal study program.  
The timing of the prim ary and secondary endpoints after vaccination is consistent with previous 
trials with TDV. Dengue neutralizing antibodies have been generally accepted as the immune 
response endpoint for dengue vaccine trials .

CONFIDENTIAL  The blood sampling schedule and exploratory an alyses will allow a comprehensive analysis of 
the kinetics (onset, longevity) of the various immune responses.  
Considering that the measurements of the immune responses are unlikely to be influenced by the 
knowledge of the trial group assignment,  a placebo  group for comparison has not been included 
in this trial.  
Involvement of healthy adults who are either flavivirus -naïve or seropositive for DENV -1 or 
DENV -3 in the present trial could create a subject population eligible for participation in a 
potential f uture DENV -1/DENV -3 human challenge trial if the sponsor deems this necessary in 
the further development of the trial vaccine.  
Justification of the sample size is included in Section  13.3. The rationale for the proposed trial is 
given in Section  4.2. 
The current IB contains additional product information and a more detailed review of nonclinical 
studies and clinical trials.  
6.3 Planned Duration of Subject’s Expected Participation in the Enti re Trial  
The trial duration for each subject will be at least approximately 360 days (12  months) including 
vaccination (Day  1 [M0] and Day 90 [M3]) and follow -up through Day 360 (M12). This duration 
will be approximately 14.5 months if serological testing with regard to the inclusion criteria for 
the trial is performed within the scope of this trial (ie, up to 70 days [ 10 weeks] prior to 
Day 1 [M0]).  
6.4 Premature Termination or Suspension of Trial or Investigational Site  
6.4.1 Criteria for Premature Termination or Suspension of the Trial  
The trial will be completed as planned unless one or more of the following criteria that require 
temporary suspension or early termination of the trial  are satisfied . 
 New information or other evaluation regarding the safety or effic acy of the investigational 
vaccine that indicates a change in the known risk/benefit profile, such that the risk/benefit is 
no longer acceptable for subjects participating in the trial.  
 The Data Monitoring Committee ( DMC ) recommends that the trial should b e suspended or 
terminated.  
 Significant deviation from GCP that compromises the ability to achieve the primary trial 
objectives or compromises subject safety.  
 The sponsor decides to terminate or suspend the trial .

CONFIDENTIAL  6.4.2 Criteria for Premature Termination or Suspe nsion of Investigational Sites  
A trial site may be terminated prematurely or suspended if the site (including the investigator) is 
found in significant deviation from GCP, protocol, or contractual agreement, is unable to ensure 
adequate performance of the trial, or as otherwise permitted by the contractual agreement.  
6.4.3 Procedures for Premature Termination or Suspension of the Trial or the 
Participation of Investigational Site(s)  
In the event that the sponsor, an Institutional Review B oard (IRB)/ Independent Et hics 
Com mittee (IEC) or regulatory authority elects to terminate or suspend the trial or the 
participation of the investigational site, a trial -specific procedure for early termination or 
suspension will be provided by the sponsor; the procedure will be fo llowed by the investigational 
site during the course of termination or trial suspension.

22. Planned travel (during the trial conduct) to any area endemic for  dengue.  
There may be instances when individuals meet all entry criteria except one that relates to 
transient clinical circumstances (eg, body temperature elevation or recent use of excluded 
medication [s] or vaccine [s]). Under these circumstances, eligibility for trial enrollment may be 
considered if the appropriate window for delay has passed, inclusion/exclusion criteria have been 
rechecked, and if the subject is confirmed to be eligible.  
7.3 Criteria for Delay of Trial Vaccine  Administration  
After en rollment, subjects may encounter clinical circumstances that warrant a delay in the 
administration of trial vaccin e. These situations are listed below. In the event that a subject meets 
a criterion for delay of trial vaccine administration , the subject may  receive the trial vaccine once 
the window for delay has passed as long as the subject is otherwise eligible for trial participation.  
If any of the conditions below occur at the time scheduled for the second TDV administration 
(Day  90 [M3]), the second dos e may be administered at a later date as long as the subject is 
otherwise eligible to continue trial participation. In certain situations, the period of delay may 
lead to deviation from the time window for the second dose at Day 90 (M3). The decision to 
vaccinate in those situations will be made by the investigator.  
The following clinical circumstances warrant a delay for administration of the vaccination  
(consider whether applicable as criterion for delay of trial vaccine administration or an exclusion 
criterion , see Section 7.2): 
 Subjects with a clinically active significant infection (as assessed by the investigator) or body 
temperature ≥38°C (100. 4°F) within 3 days of the intended date of vaccination . 
 Subjects who have received any other vaccines within 14 days (for inactivated vaccines) or 
28 days (for live vaccines) prior to enrollment in this trial or who are planning to receive any 
vaccine with in 28 days of trial vaccine administration . 
 Known or suspected altered or impaired immune function as specified under the exclusion 
criteria  (see Section 7.2, exclusion criterion no. 6). 
 Subjects who have used antipyretics and/or analgesic medications within 24 hours prior to 
vaccination. The reason for their use (prophylaxis versus treatment) must be documented. 
Trial vaccine administration should be delayed to allow for a full 24  hours to have passed 
between having used antipyretics and/or analgesic medications and trial vaccine 
administration . 
7.4 Early Termination of a Subject ’s Trial Participat ion 
Under some circumstances, a subject’s trial participation may be terminated early. This means 
that no further trial procedures (including data collection) will be performed on that subject

CONFIDENTIAL  beyond the specific date of early termination  of trial particip ation . The primary reason for early 
termination of the subject ’s trial participation should be documented using the following 
categories. While the subject has no obligation to provide a reason for withdrawing consent, 
attempts should be made to determine the underlying reason for the withdrawal and, where 
possible, the primary underlying reason should be documented.  
For screen failure subjects, refer to Section 9.1.13 . 
1. Adverse Event: The subject has experienced an AE (irrespective of being related /unrelated to 
the trial vaccine [s], or trial -related procedures) that requires early termination because 
continued participation imposes an unacceptable risk to the subject’s health and /or the 
subject is unwilling to continue participation because of the AE. If the subject is unwilli ng to 
continue because of the AE,  the primary reason for early termination of trial participation in 
this case will be ‘withdrawal due to AE’ and not ‘withdrawal of consent’, see below. Any 
ongoing AEs leading to early termination of trial participation should  be followed  up by the 
investigator  until resolution or stabilization . 
2. Lost to follow -up: The subject did not return to the clinic and at least 3 attempts to contact 
the subject were unsuccessful.  
3. Withdrawal of consent: The subject wishes to withdraw from the  trial. The primary  reason 
for early termination will be “withdrawal of consent” if the subject withdraws from 
participation due to a non -medical reason (ie, reason other than AE) . The reason for 
withdrawal, if provided, should be recorded in the eCRF.  
4. Premature trial termination by the sponsor, a regulatory agency, the IEC/IRB, or any other 
authority.  
If the clinical trial is prematurely terminated by the sponsor, the investigator is to promptly 
inform the trial subjects and local IEC/IRB and should assure  appropriate follow -up for the 
subjects. The primary reason for early termination in this case will be “trial termination”.  
5. Subject’s death during trial participation.  
6. Other.  
7.5 Criteria for Premature Discontinuation of Trial Vaccine Administration  
Criteria for contraindication to vaccination at Day 90 (M3):  
There are also circumstances under which receipt of the second trial vaccine  dose at 
Day 90 (M3) is contraindicated in this trial. These circumstances include but are not limited to 
anaphylaxis or severe hypersensitivity reactions following the first TDV vaccination at 
Day 1 (M0). If these reactions occur, the subject must not receive the TDV vaccination at 
Day 90 (M3) but will be encouraged to continue trial participation for safety follow -up. 
Early termi nation of a subject ’s trial participation  will by default prevent the subject from 
receiving further doses of trial vaccine , as the subject will no longer be participating in the trial. 
In addition to criteria for early termination of a subject’s participa tion (see Section 7.4), other

CONFIDENTIAL  situations may apply in which subjects may continue participating in the trial (eg, contributing 
safety data accordin g to protocol) but trial v accine  administration is discontinued. Even if the 
subject is deemed ineligible to receive further doses of trial vaccine , all efforts should be made to 
continue the collection of saf ety data according to protocol.  
In addition, the primary  reason for premature discontinuation of trial vacci ne administration 
should be recorded in the  “End of Trial Vaccine  Administration ” eCRF  using the following 
categories : 
1. Adverse Event: The subject has experienced an AE (irrespectiv e of being related /unrelated to 
the trial vac cine or trial -related procedures) for which subsequent trial vaccine  
administration(s) impose an unacceptable risk to the subject’s health, but the subject will 
continue trial participation for safety, or a subset of other trial procedures.  
2. Lost to follow -up: The subject did not return to the clinic and at least 3 attempts to contact 
the su bject were unsuccessful.  
3. Withdrawal of consent: The subject wishes to withdraw from the trial. The primary  reason  
for early termination will be “ withdrawal of consent” if the subject withdraws from 
participation due to a non -medical reason (ie, reason other than AE). The reason for 
withdrawal, if provided, should be recorded in the eCRF . 
4. Premature trial terminat ion by sponsor, a regulatory agency, the IEC/IRB, or any other 
authority.  
If the clinical trial is prematurely terminated by the sponsor, the investi gator is to promptly 
inform the trial subjects and local IEC/IRB and s hould assure appropriate follow -up fo r the 
subjects. The primary reason for early te rmination in this case will be “ trial termination”.  
5. Subject´s death during trial participation.  
6. Protocol deviation: A protocol deviation is any change, divergence, or departure from the 
trial design or procedures of a trial protocol. The subject may remain in the trial unless 
continuation in the trial jeopardizes the subject’s health, safety or rights (see Section 7.4). 
7. Pregnancy : Any subject who, despite the requirement for adequate contraception, becomes 
pregnant during the  trial will not receive further trial vac cine administrations . Pregnant 
subjects should, however, be asked to continue participating  in the trial contributing data to 
the safety follow -up according to protocol. In addition, the site should maintain contact with 
the pregnant subject and complete a “ Clinical Trial Pregnancy Form” as soon as possible. 
The subject should be followed -up unt il the birth of the child, or spontaneous or voluntary 
termination; when pregnancy outcome information becomes available, the information 
should be captured using the same form. Data obtained from the “Clinical Trial Pregnancy 
Form” will be captured in the  safety database.

CONFIDENTIAL  8.0 CLINICAL TRIAL MATERIAL MANAGEMENT  
This section contains information regarding all trial vaccines and materials provided directly by 
the sponsor, and/or sourced by other means, that are required by the trial protocol, including 
important sections describing the management of clinical trial material.  
8.1 Trial Vaccine  and Materials  
The investigational vaccine is Takeda’s TDV, a tetravalent dengue vaccine comprised of 
1 molecularly characterized, attenuated dengue virus strain, and 3 chim eric dengue virus strains 
with potencies of not less than 3.3, 2.7, 4.0, and 4.5 log 10 plaque forming units per dose of 
TDV -1, TDV -2, TDV -3, and TDV -4, respectively.  
8.1.1 Dosage Form, Manufacturing, Packaging, and Labeling  
Manufacturing of monovalent bulk vacci ne substances of TDV, mixing of the 4 TDV vaccine 
substances, filling into vials, and lyophilization of TDV is done at IDT Biologika GmbH, 
Germany.  
Lyophilized TDV is presented in a single -dose 2 mL glass vial with a grey bromo  butyl rubber 
stopper and flip -top aluminum over seal . 
TDV diluent (37 mM sodium chloride solution) is a clear, colorless solution provided in a 
single -use 2 mL glass vial  or a single -use 1 mL  glass syringe and is used to reconstitute the 
lyophilized TDV t o deliver a 0.5 mL dose.  
TDV and TDV diluent vials are packaged together into single dose dispensing cartons.  The units 
will be labeled to contain pertinent trial information in local languages.  
The sponsor will supply the trial site with TDV and TDV dilue nt packaged into single dose 
dispensing cartons.  The units and cartons will be labeled with pertinent trial information in local 
languages. Further details can be found in the Pharmacy Manual.  
8.1.2 Storage  
The trial vaccine (TDV) and TDV diluent will be shipped  in refrigerated containers at 2°C to 
8°C. From receipt and prior to use, TDV and TDV diluent must be protected from light and 
stored at 2°C to 8°C in a refrigerator. Do not freeze.  
All clinical trial material must be kept in an appropriate, limited -access , secure place until it is 
used or returned to the sponsor or designee for destruction. All sponsor -supplied vaccines must 
be stored under the conditions specified on the label and remain in the original container until 
dispensed. A daily temperature log o f the vaccine storage area must be maintained every 
working day. Temperature excursions must be reported to the sponsor as soon as possible and 
use of these vaccines requires sponsor approval.

CONFIDENTIAL  8.1.3 Dose and Regimen  
All subjects in Groups 1 and 2 are to receive 1 trial vaccine dose on Day 1 (M0) and  1 trial 
vaccine dose on Day 90 [M3]) . 
The 0.5 mL trial vaccine doses will be prepared and administered by the pharmacist or vaccine 
administrator according to the instructions in the Pharmacy Manual or per sponsor ins tructions.  
TDV will be administered by the SC route . 
8.2 Trial Vaccine Assignment and Dispensing Procedures  
Refer to Section 8.6 for accountability of sponsor -supplied vaccines.  
If sponsor -supplied vaccine is lost or damaged, the site can request a replacement. Expired 
vaccines must not be administered.  
Prior to vaccin ation, a subject must be determined to be eligible for trial vaccination and it must 
be clinically appropriate in the judgment of the investigator to vaccinate. Eligibility for 
vaccination prior to first trial vaccine administration is determined by evalua ting the entry 
criteria outlined in this protocol (see Section 7.1 and Section 7.2). 
Eligibility for subsequent trial vaccination is determined by following the criteria outlined in 
Section  7.3. 
Trial vaccine should not be administered to individuals with known hypersensitivity to any 
component of the vaccine.  
8.2.1 Precautions to be Observed when  Administering the Trial Vaccine  
Prior to trial vaccine administration, a subject must be determined to be eligible to receive trial 
vaccine and it must be clinically appropriate in the judgment of the investigator to administer the 
trial vaccine . 
First, trial eligibility is evaluated according to  the entry criteria outlined in this protocol 
(Sections  7.1 and 7.2). Once eligibility is confirmed, the subject is able to receive the first trial 
vaccination.  
Prior to subsequent trial vaccine administration, site staff must determine if the subject is elig ible 
to receive vaccination by evaluating the criteria outlined in Sections 7.3, 7.4, and 7.5. 
Standard immunization practices are to be observed and care should be taken to administer the 
injection by the SC route. In addition, WHO recommendations to reduce anxiety and pain at the 
time of vaccination should be followed [ 18]. Before administering the trial vaccine, the 
vaccination site is to be  disinfected with a skin disinfectant (eg, 70% alcohol). Allow the skin to 
dry. DO  NOT inject intravascularly . 
As with all injectable vaccines, trained medical personnel and appropriate medical treatment 
should be readily available in case of anaphylactic reactions following vaccination. For example,

8.5 Unblinding Procedure  
Not applicable.  
8.6 Accountability and Destruction of Sponsor -Supplied Trial Vaccine  and Other 
Clinical Trial Materials  
Vaccine supplies will be counted and reconciled at the site before being locally destroyed or 
returned to the sponsor or designee as noted below. The s ite will maintain source documents.  
The investigator or designee must ensure that the sponsor -supplied  trial vaccine  is used in 
accordance with the approved protocol and is /are administered only to subjects enrolled in the 
trial. To document appropriate use of sponsor -supplied  trial vaccine  (TDV including TDV 
diluent) , the investigator must maintain records o f all sponsor -supplied trial vaccine  delivery to 
the site, site inventory, administration and use by each subject, and return to the sponsor or 
designee.  
Upon receipt of sponsor -supplied  trial vaccine , the investigator or designee must verify the 
contents of the shipments against the packing list. The verifier should ensure that the quantity is 
correct, the trial vaccine  is received within the labeled storage conditions (ie, no cold chain break 
has occurred during transit), and is in good condition. If quan tity and conditions are acceptable, 
investigator or designee will acknowledge receipt of the shipment by signing bottom half of the 
packing list and forward the list  per instructions provided on the form . 
If there are any discrepancies between the packing list versus the actual product received, the 
sponsor or designee must be contacted to resolve the issue. The packing list should be filed in the  
Pharmacy  Investigator Site File by a qualified investigator designee . 
The pharmacist (or designated individual)  at the site must maintain 100% accountability for 
sponsor -supplied trial vaccine  (TDV including TDV diluent) and other clinical trial material 
received and administered during their entire participation in the trial. Accountability includes, 
but is not li mited to:  
 Verifying that actual inventory matches documented inventory.  
 Verifying that the log is co mpleted for the vaccine lot used to prepare each dose.  
 Verifying that all trial vaccine kits used are documented accurately on the log .

CONFIDENTIAL   Verifying that required fields are completed accurately and legibly.  
If any dispensing errors or discrepancies are discovered, the sponsor must be notified 
immediately.  
The pharmacist (or designated individual) at the site must record the current inventory of all 
sponsor -supplied vaccine (TDV including TDV diluent) on a sponsor -approved vaccine 
accountability log. The following information will be recorded at a minimum: protocol number 
and title, name of investigator, site identifier and number, description of sponsor -supplied trial 
vaccine, expiry and/or retest date, and amount. The log should include all required information 
as a separate entry for each subject to whom sponsor -supplied trial vaccine is administered . 
The investigator will be notified of any expiry date or retest date extension of trial vaccine or 
clinical trial material during the trial conduct. On expiry date notification from the sponsor or 
designee, the site must complete all instructions outlined i n the notification, including 
segregation of expired clinical trial material for return to the sponsor or its designee for 
destruction . 
Prior to site closure or at appropriate intervals throughout the trial, before any trial vaccine or 
clinical trial mater ials are returned to the sponsor  or designee for destruction, a representative 
from the sponsor  will perform clinical trial material accountability and reconciliation. The 
investigator will retain a copy of the documentation regarding clinical trial materi al 
accountability, return and/or destruction, and originals will be sent to the sponsor or designee.

qualified and trained staff . 
9.1.1 Informed Consent  
The requirements of the informed consent  form are described in Section 15.2. 
Informed consent must be obtained prior to the subject entering into the trial, and before any 
protocol -directed procedures are performed.  
A unique subject number w ill be assigned to each subject  after informed consent is obtained . If 
all eligibility criteria are fulfilled, this subject number will be used throughout the trial. Subject 
numbers assigned to subjects who fail screening should not  be reused (Section 9.1.13 ). 
9.1.2 Demographics, Medical History and Prior Medications  
Demographic information to be obtained will include age, sex, race, and ethnicity as described 
by the subject . 
Medical history will also be collected, includ ing but not limited to any medical history that may 
be relevant to subject eligibility for trial participation such as prior vaccinations, concomitant 
medications, and previous and ongoing illnesses and/or injuries. Relevant medical history can 
also includ e any medical history that contributes to the understanding of an AE that occurs 
during trial participation, if it represents an exacerbation of an underlying disease/preexisting 
problem.  
Medical history (including corresponding medication) to be obtained will include any significant 
conditions or diseases that have disappeared or resolved at or prior to signing of the informed 
consent form.  
Adverse medical occurrences emerging during the time between signing of the informed consent  
form  and the first admin istration of trial vaccine will be recorded in the “Medical History ” eCRF. 
If such an adverse medical occurrence is assessed as related to a trial procedure this should be 
recorded in the eCRF as an AE related to trial procedure.  
All medications, vaccines and blood products taken or received by the subjects are to be 
collected as “Prior and Concomitant Medications ” and recorded on the “Prior and Concomitant 
Medications ” eCRF  and in the subject’s source document :

CONFIDENTIAL  9.1.12  Pregnancy  
To ensure subject safety and the safety of the unborn child, each pregnancy in a subject having 
received a trial  vaccine  must be reported to the sponsor within 24 hours of the site learning of its 
occurrence. If the subject becomes pregnant during the trial, she will not receive any further 
doses of any trial vaccine. The pregnancy must be followed to determine outcome, including 
spontaneous or voluntary termination, details of birth, and the presence or absence of any birth 
defects, congenital abnormalities, or maternal and/or newborn complications. This follow -up 
should occur even if the intended duration of sa fety follow -up for the trial has ended.  
Any pregnancy occurring following trial vaccine  administration should be reported immediately, 
using a “Clinical Trial P regnancy Form”, to the contact listed in the Investigator Site File.  
9.1.13  Documentation of Subjects Who are Not Randomized  
Investigators must account for all subjects who sign an informed consent. If the subject is found 
to be not eligible at  Day 1 (M0) , the investigator should complete the eCRF . Randomization is 
not applicable for the trial.  
The primary reason for not receiving the trial vaccine is to be recorded in the eCRF using the 
following categories : 
 Adverse medical occurrence prior to receipt of investigational vaccine.  
 Screen failure (did not meet one or more inclusion criteria or did meet one or more exclusion 
criteria).  
 Withdrawal by subject.  
 Site terminated by sponsor.  
 Trial terminated by sponsor.  
 Other (specify reason) . 
Subject numbers assigned to enrolled subjects  who are not vaccinated should not be reused . 
9.2 Monitoring Subject Compliance  
The i nvestigator must record all injections of trial vaccine given to the subject in the subject’s 
source document and the eCRF .

 Careful training of the subject on how to measure solicited local (injection site)  reactions and 
body temperature, how to complete the diary card and how often to complete the diary card. 
Training should be directed at the individual(s) who wil l perform the measurements of 
solicited local (injection site)  reactions and those who will enter the information into the 
diary card. This individual may or may not be the subject, but if a person other than the 
subject  enters information into the diary card, this person’s identity must be documented in 
the subject’s source  document and this person must receive training on the diary card. 
Training of the subject on how to measure an injection site reaction and how to take their 
temperature, as well as how  to record the information in the diary card, should be performed 
while the subject is under observation after vaccination.  
Diary card instructions must include the following:  
 The individual(s)  who will enter the information into the diary card  must understand that 
timely completion of the diary card on a daily basis is a critical component of trial 
participation. This individual  should also be instructed to write clearly and to complete the 
diary card in pen. Any corrections to the diary card th at are performed by the individual(s)  
completing the diary card should include a single strikethrough line with a brief explanation 
for any change and be initialed and dated.  
Please note:  
Diary cards will be the only source document allowed for remote coll ection of solicited local 
(injection site) reactions , solicited systemic events  (including body temperature measurements) , 
and unsolicited (non-serious) AEs. The following additional rules apply to the documentation of 
safety information collected by diary  card:  
 The diary card should be reviewed with the subject.  
 No corrections or additions to the diary card will be allowed after it is reviewed with the 
investigator/designee.

CONFIDENTIAL   Any data that is identified as implausible or incorrect, and confirmed by the subj ect to be a 
transcription error , should be corrected by the subject on the diary card (the correction should 
include a single strikethrough line and should be initialed and dated by the subject).  
 Any blank or illegible fields on the diary card not otherwise corrected as above will be 
missing in the eCRF . 
 The site must enter all readable entries on the diary card into the eCRF . 
 Any newly described solicited and unsolicited (non -serious) safety infor mation should be 
added to the diary card by the subject, initialed , and dated.  
 Starting on the day of vaccination  (Day 1 [M0] and Day 90 [M3]) , the subject will check for 
specific types o f events at the injection site (ie, solicited local [injection site ] reactions ), any 
specific generalized symptoms (solicited systemic events ), body temperature , unsolicited 
(non-serious) AEs, any other symptoms or change in the subject’s health status, any 
medications taken (excluding vitamins and minerals) , and any vaccin ation . Solicited local 
(injection site ) reactions, solicited systemic events,  body temperature , and unsolicited 
(non-serious) AEs  will be recorded in the diary. Assessments should preferably take place in 
the evening at day’s end.  
 Body t emperature measurem ent is to be performed using the thermometer provided by the 
site. Assessments should take place at approximately the same time of day, preferably in the 
evening at day’s end. If the subject feels unusually hot or cold during the day, the subject 
should ch eck their temperature. If the subject has fever, the highest body temperature 
observed that day should be recorded on the diary card.  
 The measurement s of solicited local (injection site)  reactions  are to be performed using the 
ruler provided by the site.  
 The collection on the diary card  of solicited local (injection site ) reactions , solicited systemic 
events  (including body temperature measurement), and unsolicited (non -serious) AEs will 
continue for a total of 7  days, 14 days, and 28 days; respectively,  following administration of 
each trial vaccine dose (including the day of administration ). Any solicited local (injection 
site) reaction  or solicited systemic event observed as continuing on Day 8 or 15 , respectively, 
following each trial vaccination will be recorded as an AE on the “Adverse Event ” eCRF for 
follow -up. Any solicited local (injection site) reaction or systemic event that resolves before 
8 or 15 days, respectively, following each trial vaccination, but recurs at a later time (ie, if 
discontinue s), should be recorded as an unsolicited AE on the “Adverse Event ” eCRF (see 
Section  10.4.1  and Section  10.4.2 ). 
 Collect and record MAAEs. Refer to Section 10.4.3 . 
 Collect and report SAEs. Refer to Section 10.4.4 .

CONFIDENTIAL  10.0 ADVERSE EVENTS  
10.1 Definitions  
10.1.1  Adverse Events  
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation subject 
administered a trial vaccine ; it does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with trial 
vaccine administration.  
An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (eg, a clinically significant 
abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated  with the administration 
of a trial vaccine whether or not it is considered related to the trial vaccine.  
AEs will be graded by the investigator in the following manner:  
Mild  Grade 1   Awareness of symptoms that are easily tolerated, causing minimal discomfo rt and 
not interfering with everyday activities. Relieved with or without symptomatic 
treatment.  
Moderate  Grade 2   Sufficient discomfort is present to cause interference with normal activity. Only 
partially relieved with symptomatic treatment.  
Severe  Grade 3   Extreme distress, causing significant impairment of functioning or incapacitation. 
Prevents normal everyday activities. Not relieved with symptomatic treatment . 
10.1.2  Solicited Adverse Events  
The occurrence of selected indicators of safety will be measu red/collected for 7 days (solicited 
local [injection site] reactions ) and 14  days (solicited systemic events ) following administration 
of each trial vaccine dose (including the day of administration) and will be recorded on the 
“Local and Systemic Reaction s” eCRF , as applicable , and as listed in  Table 10.a. 
Any solicited local (injection site) reaction or systemic event observed as continuing on Day 8 or 
Day 15, respectively, following each trial vaccination will be recorded as an AE on the “Adverse 
Event ” eCRF  for follow -up. For these persistent/prolonged solicited AEs, the end date will be 
captured on the “Adverse Event ” eCRF  to permit a separate analysis from the unsolicited AEs 
(see Section 10.4.1  and Section 10.4.2 ).

CONFIDENTIAL  10.1.3  Adverse Events of Special Interest  
Not applicable.  
10.1.4  Medically  Attended Adverse Events  
MAAEs are defined as AEs leading to an unscheduled medical visit to or by a healthcare 
professional including visits to an emergency department, but not fulfilling seriousness criteria . 
10.1.5  Serious Adverse Events  
An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that:  
1. Results in DEATH.  
2. Is LIFE THREATENING.  
 The term “life threaten ing” refers to an event in which the subject was at risk of death at 
the time of the event; it does not refer to an event that hypothetically might have caused 
death if it were more severe.  
3. Requires inpatient HOSPITALIZATION or prolongation of existing hos pitalization.  
4. Results in persistent or significant DISABILITY/INCAPACITY.  
5. Leads to a CONGENITAL ANOMALY/BIRTH DEFECT in the offspring of a subject.  
6. Is an IMPORTANT MEDICAL EVENT that satisfies any of the following:  
 May require intervention to prevent items  1 through 5 above.  
 May expose the subject to danger, even though the event is not immediately life 
threatening or fatal or does not result in hospitalization.  
10.2 Causality of A dverse Events 
Relationship  (causality) to the trial vaccine  will also be assessed by the investigator. The 
relationship of each AE  to the trial vaccine , including  solicited systemic events (solicited local 
[injection site] reactions are considered as related by default) will be assessed using the 
following categories:  
Related:  There is suspicion that there is a relationship between the trial vaccine and 
the AE (without determining the extent of probability); there is a reasonable 
possibility that the trial vaccine contributed to the AE.  
Not Related:  There is no suspicion that there is a  relationship between the trial vaccine and 
the AE; there are other more likely causes and administration of the trial 
vaccine is not suspected to have contributed to the AE.

CONFIDENTIAL  10.2.1  Relationship to Trial Procedures  
Relationship  (causality) to trial procedures sh ould be determined for all AEs.  
The relationship should be assessed as “Yes” if the investigator considers that there is a 
reasonable possibility that an event is due to a trial procedure. Otherwise, the relationship should 
be assessed as “No”.  
10.2.2  Outcome of Adverse Events 
Resolved:  The subject has fully recovered from the event or the condition has 
returned to the level observed at Baseline . 
Resolving:  The event is improving but the subject is still not fully recovered . 
Not resolved:  The event is ongoing at  the time of reporting and the subject has still 
not recovered . 
Resolved with 
sequelae : As a result of the AE, the subject suffered persistent and significant 
disability/incapacity (eg, became blind, deaf or paralysed) . 
Fatal:  The subject died due to the  event. If the subject died due to other 
circumstances than the event, the outcome of the event per se should 
be stated otherwise (eg, not resolved or resolving) . 
Unknown:  If outcome is not known or not reported.  
10.3 Additional Points to Consider for A dverse Events 
An untoward occurrence generally may:  
 Indicate a new diagnosis or unexpected worsening of a pre -existing condition. Intermittent 
events for pre -existing conditions or underlying disease should not be considered as AEs.  
 Necessitate therapeutic  intervention.  
 Require an invasive diagnostic procedure.  
 Require trial vaccine discontinuation or a change in concomitant medication.  
 Be considered unfavorable by the investigator for any reason.  
Diagnoses vs signs and symptoms:  
 Each event should be recorded to represent a single diagnosis. Accompanying signs 
(including abnormal laboratory values) or symptoms should NOT be recorded as additional 
AEs. If a diagnosis is unknown, signs or symptoms should be recorded appropriately as AEs.  
Worsening of AEs : 
 If the subject experiences a worsening or complication of an AE after administration of the 
trial vaccine, the worsening or complication should be recorded as a new AE. Investigators

CONFIDENTIAL  should ensure that the AE term recorded captures the change in the cond ition (eg, “worsening 
of…”).  
 If the subject experiences a worsening or complication of an AE, the worsening or 
complication should be recorded as a new AE. Investigators should ensure that the AE term 
recorded captures the change in the condition (eg, “wor sening of…”).  
Changes in severity of AEs:  
 If the subject experiences changes in severity of an AE, the event should be captured once 
with the maximum severity recorded.  
Preplanned surgeries or procedures:  
 Preplanned procedures (surgeries or therapies) that  were scheduled prior to signing of 
informed consent form are not considered AEs. Complications resulting from any planned 
surgery should be reported as AEs.  
Elective surgeries or procedures:  
 Elective procedures performed where there is no change in the su bject’s medical condition 
should not be recorded as AEs but should be documented in the subject’s source documents. 
Complications resulting from an elective surgery should be reported as AEs.  
Trial procedures:  
 Adverse occurrences related to trial procedure s after signing of the informed consent form 
are considered as AEs and should be reported as AEs . 
10.4 Procedures  
10.4.1  Collection and Reporting of A dverse Events 
All AEs, whether considered related to the use of the trial vaccine or not, must be monitored 
until symp toms subside and any abnormal laboratory values have returned to Baseline, or until 
there is a satisfactory explanation for the changes observed, or until death, in which case a full 
autopsy report should be supplied, if possible. All findings must be repo rted on the “Adverse 
Event”  eCRF  and on the SAE form *, if necessary (see Section  10.4.4 ). All findings in subjects 
experi encing AEs must also be documented  in the subject’s source documents. Any unsolicited 
AEs will be collected  on diary cards by the subject for 28 days following administration of each 
trial vaccine dose (including the day of administration) . AEs leading to discontinuation (from th e 
trial or from the vaccination regimen) are collected throughout the trial. Even if the subject is 
deemed ineligible to receive further doses of trial vaccine, all efforts should be made to continue 
the collection of safety data according to protocol.  
 Reported term for the AE. 
 Start and end date .

 Investigator’s opinion of the causality (relationship) to trial procedure(s), including the 
details of the suspected procedure . 
 Action taken with the trial vaccine . 
 Outcome of event . 
*SAE reporting will be done by eCRF. If the eCRF system is unavailable, a paper sponsor SAE 
form/paper CRF should  be completed and the event must be entered into the eCRF once access 
is restored.  
10.4.2  Collection and Reporting of Solicited A dverse Events 
The occurrence of selected indicators of safety will be collected on diary cards by the subject for 
7 days (solicited local [injection site] reactions ) and 14  days (solicited systemic events ) 
following administration of each trial vaccine  dose (including the day of administration) and will 
be recorded on the “Local and Systemic Reactions” eCRF , as applicab le. These  will be 
summarized in the final report under the category “solicited AEs” to differentiate them from 
unsolicited AEs.  
Any solicited local (injection site) reaction or solicited systemic event observed as continuing on 
Day 8 or 15 , respectively, f ollowing each trial vaccination will be recorded as an AE on the 
“Adverse Event ” eCRF for follow -up. For these persistent/prolonged solicited AEs, the end date 
will be captured on the “Adverse Event” eCRF to permit a separate analysis from the unsolicited 
AEs. Any solicited local (injection site) reaction or systemic event that resolves before 8 or 
15 days, respectively, following each trial vaccination, but recurs at a later time (ie, if 
discontinues), should  be recorded as an unsolicited AE on the “Adverse Event ” eCRF  (see 
Section 10.4.1 ). 
Any solicited AE that meets any of the following criteria must be entered as an AE on the 
“Adverse Event”  eCRF : 
 Solicited local  (injection site)  reactions or systemic events  that lead the subject to withdraw 
from the trial.

13.1 Statistical and Analytical Plans  
A Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) will be prepared and finalized prior to the database lock . This 
document will provide further details regarding the definition of analysis variables and analysis 
methodology to address all trial objectives . 
Data reviews will be conducted prior to the database lock . These reviews will assess the accuracy 
and completeness of the trial database  and subject evaluability . 
This trial is designed for a descriptive evaluation of the endpoints that does not require 
hypotheses testing. Further details will be provided in the SAP.  
Summaries will be provided by trial group (Group 1 and Group 2) and further for Group 2 by 
subgroups (DENV -1 or DENV -3 seropositive).  
As tria l laboratory procedures are not carried out during the COVID -19 pandemic there is a 
possibility that not all pre -defined test results will be available prior to database lock. Thus, there 
is a risk for database unlock/relock and additional data may be adde d in CSR amendments or 
addenda to the final CSR . 
13.1.1  Analysis Sets  
Safety Set : The Safety Set will consist of all subjects who received at least 1 dose of trial 
vaccine . 
Full Analysis Set (FAS) : The FAS will include all subjects who received at least 1 dose of  trial 
vaccine and for whom a valid pre -dose and at least one valid post -dose blood sample is taken.  
Per–Protocol Set (PPS) : The PPS will include all subjects in the FAS who have no major 
protocol violations. The major protocol violation criteria will be d efined as part of the data 
review prior to database lock. The categories of major protocol violations include: (1) not 
meeting selected entry criteria, (2) receiving prohibited therapies, (3) not receiving 2 doses of 
TDV, or receiving the second vaccinatio n inadmissibly outside of the visit window, and (4) other 
major protocol violations that may be identified during data review prior to database lock.  
13.1.2  Analysis of Demographics and Other Baseline Characteristics  
Age, gender, race, and other Baseline characte ristics will be summarized descriptively.  
Summaries will be provided by trial group (Group 1 and Group 2) and further for Group 2 by

for each applicable visit. Summaries will be provided by trial group (Group 1 and Group 2) and 
further for Group 2 by subgroups (DENV -1 or DENV -3 seropositive).  
The primary immunogenicity analyses will be based on the PPS; supportive analyses may be 
provid ed based on the FAS.  
Similar descriptive analyses as for the primary immunogenicity endpoint will be provided for the 
secondary and exploratory endpoints for each applicable assay at all relevant time points , based 
on the PPS. Supportive analyses based on the FAS may also be provided for selected endpoints . 
Antibody titers will be analyzed under log -normal distribution assumption. GMT will be 
calculated for each relevant time point as anti -logarithm of arithmetic mean of natural log 
transformed titers. The 95% CI for GMT will be calculated as the anti -log transformation of 
upper and lower limits for a 2 -sided CI of the mean of the log -transformed titers (based on 
Student’s t -distribution) . 
Other quantitative data will be summarized descriptively on the origi nal scale.  
Seropositivity rates will be accompanied with 95% CIs calculated by exact (Clopper -Pearson) 
method  [21]. 
Relationship between immunogenicity measures wi ll be assessed using non -parametric 
correlation coefficient, as appropriate  [22]. Graphical methods will also be explored. Further 
details will be provided in the SAP.  
Handling of missing data will be described in the SAP.  
13.1.4  Safety Analysis  
All safety data will be summarized descriptively using the Safety Set, by trial group (Group  1 
and Group 2) and further for Group 2 by subgroups (DENV -1 or DENV -3 seropositive).  
Solicited AEs  
For each solicited AE, the number and percentage of subjects with local (injection site) reactions 
and systemic events will be summarized by event severity for each day after each vaccination 
(ie, Day 1  [M0] through Day 7 for local [injection  site] reactions and Day 1 [M0] through 
Day 14 for systemic events), and overall. Summaries of first onset of each event and the number 
of days subjects reported experiencing each event will also be provided. For subjects with more 
than 1 episode of the sa me event, the maximum severity will be used for tabulations.  
Persistent/prolonged solicited local (injection site) reactions or systemic events continuing on 
Day 8 or Day 15, respectively, following each trial vaccination will be assessed separately. 
Unles s otherwise specified, these events will not be included in the analyses/tabulations of 
unsolicited AEs and will have separate listings .

CONFIDENTIAL  14.0 QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE  
14.1 Trial -Site Monitoring Visits  
Monito ring visits to the trial site will be made periodically during the trial to ensure that all 
aspects of the protocol are followed. Source documents will be reviewed for verification of data 
recorded on the eCRF s. Source documents are defined as original doc uments, data, and records. 
The investigator and institution guarantee access to source documents by the sponsor or designee 
(Clinical Research Organization [ CRO ]) and by the IRB or IEC.  
All aspects of the trial and its documentation will be subject to revi ew by the sponsor or designee 
(as long as blinding is not jeopardized), including but not limited to the Investigator Site File , 
trial vaccine  records , subject medical records, informed consent  form documentation, 
documentation of subject authorization to use personal health information (if separate from the 
informed consent  forms), and review of eCRF s and associated source documents. It is important 
that the investigator and other trial personnel are available during the monitoring visits and that 
sufficie nt time is devoted to the process.  
In the event a monitor cannot visit the site in a timely manner due to the COVID -19 pandemic, 
alternative monitoring approaches such as remote source data verification (SDV) or telephone 
contact may be used to ensure data  quality and integrity and maintain subject  safety. Alternative 
monitoring approaches should be used only where allowed by the local Health Authority and 
when approved  by the IRB/IEC . During remote monitoring, the monitor should focus on trial 
activities that are essential to the safety of trial subjec ts and/or data reliability.  
14.2 Protocol Deviations  
The investigator should not deviate from the protocol, except where necessary to eliminat e an 
immediate hazard to trial subjects. Should other unexpected circumstances arise that will require 
deviation from protocol -specified procedures, the investigator should consult with the medical 
monitor (and IRB or IEC, as required) to determine the app ropriate course of action. There will 
be no exemptions (a prospective approved deviation) from the inclusion or exclusion criteria.  
14.3 Quality Assurance Audits and Regulatory Agency Inspections  
The trial site also may be subject to quality assurance audits by  the sponsor  or designee . In this 
circumstance, the sponsor -designated auditor will contact the site in advance to arrange an 
auditing visit. The auditor may ask to visit the facilities where laboratory samples are collected, 
where the vaccine is stored an d prepared, and any other facility used during the trial. In addition, 
there is the possibility that this trial may be inspected by regulatory agencies, including those of 
foreign governments (eg, the Food and Drug Administration [ FDA ], the Medicines and 
Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency  of the United Kingdom [MHRA] , the Pharmaceuticals 
and Medical Devices Agency of Japan  [PMDA] ). If the trial site is contacted for an inspection by 
a regulatory body, the sponsor should be notified immediately. The inves tigator and institution 
guarantee access for quality assurance auditors to all trial documents as described in 
Section  14.1.

This trial will be conducted with the highest respect for the  trial subjects according to the 
protocol, the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki  [1], and the 
ICH Harmonized Tripartite Guide line for GCP  [2]. Each investigator will conduct the trial 
according to applicable local or regional regulatory requirements and align his or her conduct in 
accord ance with the “Responsibilities of the Investigator” that are listed in Appendix  A. The 
principles of Helsinki are addressed through the protocol and through appendices containing 
requirements for informed consent and investigator responsibilities.  
15.1 Institutional Review Board  and/or I ndependent Ethics Committee  Approval  
IRBs and IECs must be constituted according to the applicable federal  requirements of each 
participating region. The sponsor or designee will require documentation noting all names and 
titles of members who make up the respective IRB or IEC. If any member of the IRB or IEC has 
direct participation in this trial, written noti fication regarding his or her abstinence from voting 
must also be obtained. If the  US site is unwilling to provide names and titles of all members due 
to privacy and conflict of interest concerns , the site  should instead provide a Federal Wide 
Assurance Nu mber or comparable number assigned by the Department of Health and Human 
Services.  
The sponsor or designee will supply relevant documents for submission to the respective IRB or 
IEC for the protocol’s review and approval. This protocol, the IB, a copy of t he informed consent  
form, and, if applicable, subject recruitment materials and/or advertisements and other 
documents required by all applicable laws and regulations, must be submitted to a central or 
local IRB or IEC for approval. The IRB’s or IEC’s writt en approval of the protocol and subject 
informed consent  form must be obtained and submitted to the sponsor or designee before 
commencement of the trial (ie, before shipment of the trial vaccine (s) or trial specific screening 
activity). The IRB or IEC appr oval must refer to the trial by exact protocol title, number, and 
version date; identify versions of other documents (eg,  informed consent  form) reviewed; and 
state the approval date. The sponsor will notify the site once the sponsor has confirmed the 
adeq uacy of site regulatory documentation and, when applicable, the sponsor has received 
permission from the competent authority to begin the trial. Until the site receives notification , no 
protocol activities, including screening may occur.  
The s ite must adhe re to all requirements stipulated by their respective IRB or IEC. This may 
include notification to the IRB or IEC regarding protocol amendments, updates to the informed 
consent  form, recruitment materials intended for viewing by subjects, local safety repo rting 
requirements, reports and updates regarding the ongoing review of the trial at intervals specified 
by the respective IRB or IEC, and submission of the investigator ’s final status report to IRB or 
IEC. All IRB and IEC approvals and relevant documentat ion for these items must be provided to 
the sponsor or designee.  
Incentives should not be used to exert undue influence on subjects for participation. Payments to 
subjects must be approved by the IRB or IEC and sponsor.

CONFIDENTIAL  15.2 Subject Information, Informed Consen t, and Subject Authorization  
Written consent documents will embody the elements of informed consent  as described in the 
Declaration of Helsinki [1] and the ICH  Guidelines for GCP [2] and will be in accordance with 
all applicable laws and regulat ions. The informed consent  form, subject authorization form (if 
applicable), and subject information sheet describe the planned and permitted uses, transfers, and 
disclosures of the subject’s personal and personal health information for the purpose of 
cond ucting the trial. The informed consent  form and the subject information sheet further explain 
the nature of the trial, its objectives, and potential risks and benefits, as well as the date informed 
consent  is given. The informed consent  form will detail th e requirements of the subject and the 
fact that the subject  is free to withdraw  at any time without giving a reason and without prejudice 
to the subject’s further medical care.  
The investigator is responsible for the preparation, content, and IRB or IEC ap proval of the 
informed consent form and if applicable, the subject authorization form. The informed consent 
form, subject authorization form (if applicable), and subject information sheet must be approved 
by both the IRB or IEC and the sponsor prior to use . 
The informed consent form, subject authorization form (if applicable), and subject information 
sheet must be written in a language fully comprehensible to the prospective subject . It is the 
responsibility of the investigator  to explain the detailed eleme nts of the informed consent  form, 
subject authorization form (if applicable), and subject information sheet (if applicable) to the 
subject . Information should be given in both oral and written form whenever possible and in the 
manner deemed appropriate by the IRB or IEC.  
The subject  must be given ample opportunity to: (1) inquire about details of the trial and 
(2) decide whether or not to participate in the trial. If the subject  determines he or she  will 
participate in the trial, then the informed consent  form and subject authorization form (if 
applicable) must be signed and dated by the subject, at the time of consent and prior to the 
subject entering into the trial. The subject should be instructed to sign using their legal names, 
not nicknames, using blu e or black ballpoint ink. The investigator must also sign and date the 
informed consent  form and subject authorization (if applicable) at the time of consent and prior 
to the subject entering into the trial; however, the sponsor may allow a designee of the  
investigator to sign to the extent permitted by applicable law.  
Once signed, the original informed consent, subject authorization form (if applicable), and 
subject information sheet will be stored in the investigator ’s site file. The investigator must 
document the date the subject  signs the informed consent  form in the subject’s medical record 
and eCRF . Copies of the signed informed consent  form, the signed subject authorization form (if 
applicable), and subject information sheet (if applicable) shall b e given to the subject.  
All revised informed consent forms must be reviewed and signed by the subject  in the same 
manner as the original informed consent  form. The date the revised consent was obtained should 
be recorded in the subject’s medical record and  eCRF , and the subject should receive a copy of 
the revised informed consent  form.

CONFIDENTIAL  15.3 Subject Confidentiality  
The sponsor and designee affirm and uphold the principle of the subject’s right to protection 
against invasion of privacy. Throughout this trial, a s ubject’s source data will only be linked to 
the sponsor ’s clinical trial database or documentation via a unique identification number. As 
permitted by all applicable laws and regulations, limited subject attributes, such as sex, age, or 
date of birth, and subject initials may be used to verify the subject and accuracy of the subject’s 
unique identification number.  
To comply with ICH Guidelines for GCP and to verify compliance with this protocol, the 
sponsor requires the investigator to permit its monitor or  designee, representatives from any 
regulatory authority (eg, FDA, MHRA , PMDA ), the sponsor ’s designated auditors, and the 
appropriate IRBs and IECs to review the subject’s original medical records (source data or 
documents), including, but not limited to,  laboratory test result reports, electrocardiogram ( ECG ) 
reports, admission and discharge summaries for hospital admissions occurring during a subject’s 
trial participation, and autopsy reports. Access to a subject’s original medical records requires 
the specific authorization of the subject as part of the informed consent  form process (see 
Section  15.2). 
Copies of any subject source documents that are provided to the sponsor must have certain 
personally identifiable information removed (ie, subject name, address, and other identifier fields 
not collected on the subject’s eCRF ).

CONFIDENTIAL  Appendix  A Responsibilities of the Investigator  
Clinical research studies sponsored by the sponsor are subject to ICH GCP and all the applicable 
local laws and regulations.  
The investigator agrees to assume the following responsibilities:  
1. Conduct the trial in accorda nce with the protocol.  
2. Personally conduct or supervise the staff that will assist in  the protocol.  
3. Ensure that trial related procedures, including trial specific (non -routine/non -standard panel) 
screening assessments , are NOT performed on potential subject s prior to the receipt of 
written approval from relevant governing bodies/authorities.  
4. Ensure that all colleagues and employees assisting in the conduct of the trial are informed of 
these obligations.  
5. Secure prior approval of the trial and any changes by an appropriate IRB/IEC that conform to

current version approved by the IRB/IEC. Each informed consent form should contain a 
subject authorization section that describes the uses and disclosures of a subject’s personal 
information (including personal health information) that will take pla ce in connection with 
the trial. If an informed consent form does not include such a subject  authorization, then the 
investigator must obtain a separate subject authorization form from each subject.  
9. Prepare and maintain adequate case histories of all perso ns entered into the trial, including 
eCRF s, hospital records, laboratory results, etc, and maintain these data for a minimum of 
2 years following notification by the sponsor that all investigations have been discontinued or

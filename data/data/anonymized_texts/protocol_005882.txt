Background  
Many Veterans from Operation Enduring Freedom/Operation Iraqi Freedom/ Operation New Dawn 
(OEF/OIF/OND) have been diagnosed with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and mild traumatic 
brain injury (mTBI).  When two conditions occur at the same time, they are said to be co -morbid. In one 
study of OEF -OIF-OND Veterans, 57.3% of Veterans who had mTBI also had PTSD.  Although little is 
known about how mTBI and PTSD affect each other, especially several years after deployment, one 
study found that  some Veteran s with TBI had traumatic stress five years after their brain injury, 
suggesting the effects of these two conditions together, or co -morbidity, may be long -lasting.    
Treatments specifically for Veterans with both mTBI and PTSD are still being developed. I t's possible 
that treatments that improve symptoms in patients with mTBI or PTSD alone may help Veterans with 
co-morbid mTBI and PTSD.  Meditation has been suggested to be effective in Veterans with PTSD and 
in civilians with TBI, improving their quality o f life.  A good treatment would also be something that a 
Veteran could learn and then be able to use at their convenience anytime or anyplace they needed it.   
The current study proposes a type of meditation targeted for Veterans, Inner Resources for Veter ans 
(otherwise known as IRV) . In addition to potentially helping to reduce symptoms and to improve function 
in the brain, IRV would offer Veterans a treatment they could utilize whenever challenging situations occur 
regardless of where they were. Since th e treatment would be relatively cost -free, IRV could also 
dramatically reduce financial costs.  
This research study is funded by Department of Veterans Affairs, Rehabilitation Research & Development  
Purpose  
The goal of this study is to learn more about how Inner Resouces for Veterans meditation therapy (IRV) 
helps Veterans with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). As 
you may know, PTSD is a disorder that occurs after exposure to one or more traumatic experiences. 
Peop le with PTSD may experience anxiety, pay extra attention to their surroundings, involuntarily 
remember their traumatic experiences, and/or want to avoid situations where these symptoms are 
increased. MTBI may result from being in a blast explosion, with pr essure from the blast potentially 
disrupting the brain's structure and function.  
In this study, we will be looking at the behavioral and neurological changes (changes in the brain) and the 
reductions in PTSD symptoms that may come from participating in thi s treatment. We are interested in 
determining if treatment does reverse changes in the brain caused by PTSD and mTBI. To help us 
understand changes in how the brain functions, you may complete a functional magnetic resonance 
imaging (fMRI) scan before and after either a 8 -week course of IRV or 8 weeks of education about PTSD

and mTBI. Your participation will help us understand how therapy for PTSD and MTBI impacts the brain's 
response to emotions and therapeutic processes.  
Procedures  
The research will be conducted at the following location(s):   
Baylor College of Medicine and Michael E. DeBakey Veterans Affairs Medical Center.  
First, we will explain this study, make sure we have answered all of your questions, and complete this 
consent  form. Then, we will ask you some additional questions to make sure that MRI scanning is safe for 
you. You must be able and willing to complete an MRI scan to participate in the study.  
Next, you will be asked to participate in an interview about your PTSD and mTBI symptoms and to fill out 
some questionnaires. The interview will take between approximately 30 minutes and 4 hours. After the 
group treatment, when you return for scanning, the interviews will last between 30 minutes and 2 hours. 
The questionnaire s will include statements and questions about different kinds of feelings, experiences, 
or problems that people sometimes have.  Information on alcohol and drug use may be asked.  
Before you begin treatment, we will ask you to complete an MRI scan. At this  time we will give you a 
detailed description of what it will be like to be in the scanner and answer any questions you have. The 
MRI scanner is located at the Michael E. DeBakey VA.  The MRI scanner uses a strong magnet and 
radio waves to obtain a picture  of the brain. To be scanned, you will enter a large room where a 
powerful magnet is located. Before you go into the scanner room, you will be instructed to remove all 
jewelry and other metal -containing objects. Once in the room with the scanner, you will lie on a narrow 
table with a plastic -encased metal coil close to your head. Next, the technician will instruct the machine 
to slide you into a small tunnel approximately 3 feet long and 25 inches wide. Only the top of your body 
goes into the scanner, so yo ur legs will "stick out" from the scanner tunnel. We will ask you to lie very 
still for the entire scan, which lasts about 30 minutes. During scanning, the machine produces a loud 
knocking noise. This is normal. The procedure is non -invasive and involves n o medication of any kind. 
Following the scan, we will ask you to fill out a questionnaire about how you felt while you were in the 
scanner. If you might have metal in your body but are not sure (for example, if you have welded in the 
past, you may have sma ll fragments of metal in your eyes without realizing it), before you have an MRI 
scan, you will be asked to undergo x -ray to identify whether you have metal in your head. A radiologist 
will look at the x -ray and determine whether it is safe for you to have  an MRI or not.  
You will have a 50% chance (like the flip of a coin) of being assigned to receive one of two treatments, 
either Inner Resources for Veterans (IRV), or a PTSD and mTBI Education group.  IRV is a meditation 
intervention specifically adapted f or use with Veterans with PTSD. It consists of eight 90 -minute group 
sessions held here at the VA.  The first third of each session is spent learning and practicing meditation 
techniques, the middle third on learning material and group discussion, and the last third practicing

homework when you're not at the VA.  The homework will take 30 minutes a day for 6 days per week.  
We will give you a week -by-week manual and four 30 -minute aud io-recordings of guided meditation to 
help you with your homework.  The intervention works mindfulness meditation techniques, including 
increasing awareness of the moment and of your breathing, imagining peaceful situations,  silently 
repeating words, and letting go of automatic thoughts that you don't want.  
The PTSD and mTBI Education group will also consist of eight 90 -minute group sessions held here at the 
VA.  You will learn a lot about what causes PTSD and mTBI, how those conditions can change people's 
lives, and what some of the treatments are for these conditions.  People in this group will also perform 
homework for 30 minutes per day for 6 days a week.   
After completing your 8 -week course of therapy, we will ask you to fill out several more questionnaires. 
This is the Posttreatment Assessment. The ques tionnaires will include statements and questions about 
different kinds of feelings, experiences, or problems that people sometimes have, and will also ask about 
your experience in group treatment.  
Then approximately four weeks after the Posttreatment Asse ssment (12 weeks after the start of the 
study), you will be asked to complete additional questionnaires and to participate in a second fMRI scan. 
This is the Follow -up Assessment.  
We want to make sure that your participation in the study does not cause you  distress after the study is 
over. A member of the clinical research staff will accompany you throughout each visit to our office. If you 
become upset during any part of the study, this staff member will be available to talk with you to ensure 
your comfort  and safety.  
All of your information will be associated with a study ID code and saved on a password -protected server 
available only to the research team. Your information and answers to questionnaires will not be attached 
to any of your identifiable infor mation.  Except for this consent form, all of your research data is de -
identified and stored in a locked file cabinet within a locked office at the Michael E. DeBakey VA. 
However, consent forms will contain your name and, because this is an intervention st udy, the last four 
digits of the social security number will also be recorded on the consent form in order to be able to enter 
information into your medical chart. All electronic research records are stored on the secure VA server. 
We maintain a master lis t of the name of Veterans who participate in the study which are linked to your 
research data by your coded study ID. This list is stored separately from the research data and is only 
accessible by the study staff. Only the Principal Investigator (PI), who  is the person who is in charge of 
the study, or the PI's co -investigators, research assistants, and governing bodies/institutions that have 
legal right to audit will have access to identifiable research data.

Potential Risks and Discomforts  
The interview will cover a range of topics, including some that are personal in nature. There is a 
possibility that you may become upset, fearful, or anxious during the interview, because you will be 
asked some detailed questions about your past traumatic experience(s). These questions may bring 
about strong memories and feelings you might have about the event(s). In describing an event, it is 
possible that you may experience a "flashback" or vivid image of the event that brings you back to the

Some Veterans may experience some worsening of symptoms before improvements and may feel 
uncomfortable at first talking in the group setting. If you become distressed at any point during the 
therapy, please inform the therapist. You can stop participating in the group at any time and seek other 
treatment with no penalty.  
The MRI scanner has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to determine the 
causes of some medical problems. The magnetic field will affect any metallic object. You should not 
participate if you have any type of metallic implant in your body, including pacemakers, aneurysm clips, 
shrapnel, metal fragments, orthopedic pins, screws, or plates, IUD's or piercings that you cannot 
remove.  
If you have any of these, there is a ris k that the magnetic field could cause them to move or heat up. 
Individuals who potentially have metal in their bodies but are not sure, for example, people with a history 
of welding, will be asked to have an x -ray taken before the scan in order to identify  whether there is 
metal in their bodies. If you receive an x -ray, your participation in this research study involves exposure 
to radiation. The radiation dose involved in x -rays is 10 -20 millirem. We are exposed to radiation every 
day of our lives from bot h natural and manmade sources. The average effective dose to a member of 
the U.S. is about 360 millirem per year. By comparison, the radiation dose that you will receive when 
participating in this research study is less than the annual amount, and the risk  of potential harmful 
effects is considered to be minimal.  
You may experience some muscle discomfort from lying in the scanner. You may also become cold while 
lying in the scanner. If this happens, we can provide with a sheet or blanket.  
Some people become  nervous or experience claustrophobia, a fear of enclosed places, in the scanner. If 
this happens to you, you may ask to be withdrawn and we will do so immediately.  
A small number of people experience a sense of dizziness in the magnet. This is due to the magnetic 
field, and if it disturbs you, you may ask to be withdrawn and we will do so immediately.  
If at any time during this study, you feel that anything is causing you anxiety or any other unpleasant 
sensation, please inform the study staff. The study w ill be immediately stopped and you will be withdrawn 
from the scanner.  
There is an intercom hooked up so that you can talk to people in the control room between scanning 
sessions, and an emergency button so that you can be withdrawn from the scanner immediately should 
you need to.  MARY R. NEWSOME  VAMC:

If at any time you decide to end your participation in this study, you are free to do so without any penalty. 
Your medical treatment at the VA will not be affected in any way.  
You will be informed of any information that may affect your decision to stay in  the study.  
Study staff will update you in a timely way on any new information that may affect your decision to stay in 
the study.  There is a small risk for the loss of confidentiality. However, the study personnel will make 
every effort to minimize these  risks.  
Potential Benefits  
The benefits of participating in this study may be:  improvements in your PTSD and mTBI symptoms and 
comorbid problems such as depression and anxiety.  Your participation may also help the investigators 
better understand the effects of PTSD on the brain an d the effectiveness of treatment in helping resolve 
PTSD symptoms. Eventually, this may also lead to an understanding of how we may treat and ultimately 
prevent changes in the brain which stem from PTSD and mTBI. It could also eventually help us to 
improve  treatment for other Veterans with PTSD and mTBI.  You may also receive a CD with your brain 
images and a report from a radiologist on the health of your brain.  However, you may receive no benefit 
from participating.  
Alternatives  
The following alternative procedures or treatments are available if you choose not to participate in this 
study: The MEDVAMC trauma recovery program offers a variety of treatments for PTSD, including but not 
limited to Cognitive Processing Therapy, Prolong ed Exposure Therapy, PTSD Education Group, and 
Essential Skills for PTSD.  
Investigator Withdrawal of Subject from a Study  
The investigator or sponsor may decide to stop you from taking part in this study at any time. You could be 
removed from the study for  reasons related only to you (for example, if you move to another city, if you do 
not or are unable to comply with study procedures) or because the entire study is stopped.

1. OBJECTIVES  
 
This study’s primary objective is to determine the sensitivity and specificity of multiparametic, endorectal - 
magnetic resonance imaging (MP -erMRI) in classifying prostate cancer disease extent and grade relative to  
transrectal ultrasound -guided (TRUS) biopsy in men considering active surveillance (AS). We hypothesize MP - 
erMRI prior to AS for men with low risk disease can identify men who harbor more extensive or higher -risk 
prostate cancer. Identifying and treating these higher risk men early may result in better outcomes for both  
groups. Specifically, more men will rema in on AS in follow up and those who are treated early will have better  
outcomes. We anticipate that correctly identifying individuals likely to remain on AS will make this initial  
treatment approach more appealing to men with newly diagnosed low -risk prost ate cancer and to their  
physicians.  
 
1.1 Study  Design  
 
A prospective, single arm study assessing the sensitivity and specificity of multi -parametric magnetic  
resonance imaging in identifying men whose disease will be upgraded on subsequent repeat biopsy in  
individuals  with previously  untreated prostate  cancer considering  AS. 
 
1.2 Primary  Objectives  
 
Determine  the sensitivity  and specificity  of MP-erMRI  relative to repeat 12  core TRUS biopsy  for 
classifying  upgrading  of disease  extent  or Gleason  grade  in men  considering  AS 
 
1.3 Secondary  Objectives  
 
o Determine  the frequency  of MP-erMRIs which  appear to  reclassify  men with  low risk  disease  
considering  AS 
o Determine  effect of MP -erMRI  and rebiopsy  on patient -reported health states  
o Correlate the pathology findings from a targeted biopsy with the MP -erMRI findings for those  
men who fall into the reclassified category.  
 
2. BACKGROUND  
 
 
2.1 Study  Disease  
 
Prostate cancer is a major cause of morbidity and mortality among men in the United States. Many men with  
prostate cancer have a slow growing tumor and experience an indolent course even without curative therapy [1].  
The Scandinavian trial of radical prostatectomy versus watchful waiting [2, 3] demonstrated that definitive local  
therapy  compared to  observation  alone decreases  subsequent risk  of metastases  and prostate  cancer  death.  
However, 15 men had to have a surgical resection to prevent one cancer -specific death during a median 12  
years  of follow -up. Conversely, some  men with apparently  localized  disease  die of their cancer  despite  initial  
therapy  because of the  presence  of undiagnosed  micrometastases.  
This biologic heterogeneity in prostate cancer has been brought into sharp focus as a result of widespread  
adoption of prostate specific antigen (PSA) screening in many countries, with a resulting marked migration  
towards  the diagnosis of  lower -risk prostate  cancer [4].  There  are now more  than 240,000 men in the  United

States diagnosed with prostate cancer each year [5], and 90 percent of prostate cancers are clinically localized at  
time of diagnosis [4]. Data from the randomized trials of PSA screening [6, 7] highlight the considerable  
overdiagnosis and overtreatment of men with screen -detected prostate cancer with very low prostate -cancer  
specific  mortality  rates in  modern series  [8-10]. 
In this setting,  there  is an increasing  recognition that  some  men may  defer  or even avoid  treatment.  This strategy  
of AS focuses on closely monitoring patients and intervening only when their disease becomes clinically  
significant. This stands in contrast to the watchful waiting approach used in the Scandinavian study, where men  
are simply observed and palliative treatments are instigated when necessary [3]. For AS, the aim is to intervene  
with curative intent at the time of disease progression.  Given the long natural history of low -risk disease [11],  
this strategy could both spare many men the morbidity associated with surgery or radiation and provide  
significant  cost savings  [12] without  negatively  affecting  cancer -related death  rates.  
While many groups have prospectively explored AS [13 -18] with generally excellent clinical outcomes,  
significant  questions  remain  regarding  which  men are most  suitable  for AS and what  thresholds  for treatment  
should be  utilized.  
The success of AS is predicated on several assumptions. The ability to reliably: ( 1) identify men who are at a  
low-risk of having incurable disease at diagnosis, ( 2) identify men unlikely to progress to incurable disease in  
the interval between visits, and ( 3) identify clinica l or pathologic features from biopsy suggesting the need for  
immediate definitive local treatment.  All three of these remain challenging and likely reduce the number of  
clinicians and patients who feel comfortable with AS. In this protocol, we aim to bette r identify men most likely  
to continue on AS, and therefore  those most  likely  to benefit from this approach.  
As summarized in the tables, several groups have published their experience with AS. Typically, men with low - 
risk disease have been selected for A S (Table 1 ), followed with PSAs and rebiopsies every 1 -2 years ( Table 2 ), 
and with limited follow -up, have  been shown  to have  excellent cause -specific  survival rates ( Table  3).

definitive treatment. Longer follow -up will be needed to better identify the first group as most series have  
reported low rates of metastatic disease or prostate cancer specific mor tality. Lacking randomized studies  
comparing follow up approaches, the second group has been identified variously ( Table 2 ) but typically with  
either a rise in the PSA or an increase in the tumor grade or volume. Both markers are associated with disease  
progression but decision making around small changes in PSA rely on untested assumptions [24] regarding the  
relationship  between  PSA and tumor  volume,  location  or aggressiveness.  Unlike  PSA,  where  one would  have  to  T stage  Gleason  PSA  cores  positive  PSA  density

Early  work  
by Epstein et  al at. at Johns Hopkins  found  clinical factors associated  with very low volume, low  grade  disease  
[28] which  are now incorporated  into practice guidelines  from  the National  Comprehensive  Cancer Network.  
These factors include a T category of T1c, Gleason grade of 6 or lower, two or fewer prostate biopsy cores  
positive for ca ncer, none of which have >50 percent tumor involvement and a PSA  density ([PSA]/prostate  
volume on transrectal ultrasound) of less than 0.15 ng/mL/mL.  While Johns Hopkins has adopted similar  
criteria for entry into their AS protocol, other groups have been less restrictive ( Table 1 ). Nomograms now  
exist which predict m en likely to harbor low volume, low risk disease [29 -31] though how these should be  
applied  to selecting men for AS remains to be  determined.  
The challenge  at the time of diagnosis  remains  that the standard  12 biopsy  is inadequate  to accurately  predict  
the final Gleason score secondary to sampling errors [25 -27]. Reported rates vary widely but it is estimated that  
approximately one -third of cases are upgraded on Gleason between the diagnostic biopsy and a radical  
prostate ctomy [26].  Confidently identifying men at diagnosis likely to have organ -confined disease at the outset  
is thought to be important as extracapsular extension (ECE) or seminal vesicle invasion (SVI) at the time of  
local therapy are associated with a poor o utcome [32]. A systematic review of surgical outcomes for men with  
very limited disease  extent on diagnostic biopsy  suggests that adverse  pathologic findings such

as ECE are present in up to 50% of cases though much of the data was from 10 or more years ago with fewer  
biopsy samples taken [33]. Exploring the rates of ECE or SVI among large surgical cohorts categorized by  
whether they met entrance criteri a for the various AS protocols, groups have found rates of 7 percent ECE for  
the Johns Hopkins criteria which is the most restrictive to 18 percent for the Royal Marsden criteria which is  Royal

 most permissive [25]. Taking the same approach of retrospectively co mparing a surgical cohort to the various  
published AS protocol entry criteria, Gleason upgrading was noted in 23 -35 percent of men and seminal vesicle

have  found that using  the Epstein  criteria, more  than 10%  of men treated with prostatectomy  have  disease  
reclassification  [25, 34]  highlighting  the need for additional markers  of disease  extent.

Rebiopsy  
 
In light of the si gnificant sampling errors in the classification of men considered appropriate for active  
surveillance, repeat biopsy in follow up has been used as a component of surveillance protocols. Memorial  
Sloan Kettering Cancer Center adopted a strategy of recommending immediate rebiopsy for all men considering  
AS at their institution [35].  Between 2002 and 2007, 104 men who met eligibility criteria for AS at Memorial  
Sloan Kettering Cancer Center ( Table 1 ) underwent immediate 14 -core rebiopsy [35]. Among these rebiopsies,  
26% had no ca ncer identified. For those with cancer on the rebiopsy, 77% had Gleason ≤6, 22% had Gleason 7  
and one man ha d Gleason 9. From the standpoint of upstaging of disease extent, 13% were found to have >3  
cores positive and 16% had >50% of any core involved. In total, 27% had either upstaging or up -grading on the  
biopsy. A  subset of these men, 64%, had an erMRI prior to re -biopsy with 27% showing a finding concerning  
for ECE. None of the men without evidence of ECE were up -staged or upgraded compared to 39% among those  
with concerning MRI features. A subsequent analysis sho wed that those men without cancer identified on the  
confirmatory biopsy were less likely to progress to definitive treatment over the course of the study [22].  Other  
retrospective analyses show similar results [36, 37].  In line with these results, the first biopsy following  
diagnosis  has tended to result in the  greatest number of  men being  upgraded on AS protocols  [38, 39].  
Though biopsy remains the gold standard for reclassification, it carries what appear to be increasing risks [40,  
41]. Highlighting the short -term effects, in one recent report of nearly one thousand men who had undergone  
biopsy, 44% noted pain, 66% had hematuria, 37% had hematochezia, 93% had hemoejaculate and 18% had  
fever in the days following the procedure [42].  Many o f these symptoms were not considered moderate or  
serious  problems by  the participants though 15%  had some  pain and 3%  had fever two  weeks or more  after the 
biopsy. Significantly, the rates of hospitalization for infections following prostate biopsies appea r to be  
increasing [40, 43, 44].  Though the absolute rates of sepsis following biopsy remain low [42, 43], the  
increasing risk appears to be related to resistance to antibiotics used in pre -biopsy prophylaxis [41, 45]. These  
findings highlight that approac hes other than frequent, repeated biopsies will be necessary to classify men as  
candidates  for AS.

MRI has been investigated as a non -invasive method to determine disease extent and provide insights into  
disease progression in prostate cancer [46].  Endorectal MRI has been shown to have variable sensitivity and  
specificity for tumor localization, extracapsular extension and seminal vesicle invasion [47 -51]. While MRI can  
provide excellent morphologic information re garding the prostate, it also has the capacity to evaluate  
physiologic properties. Using diffusion -weighted images (DWI) and dynamic contrast -enhanced (DCE)  
imaging, multi -parametric (MP) -MRI may be better at correlating with disease risk [52] and localiza tion [52 - 
54]. Several  groups  have  published  on the use of MP-MRI  in active  surveillance  populations  [55]. MP -MRI  
may be better  at correlating  with disease  risk and localization [56].  
The group at  the Royal  Marsden  reported on 80  men in their  cohort of  326 on AS  who had a  diffusion -weighted  
(DW) MRI and a repeat biopsy as part of the protocol [55].  They found that the apparent diffuse coefficients  
(ADCs) were significantly correlated with adverse findings on repeat biopsy and on univariate analysis, was  
associated with a hazard ratio of 3.38 (95% CI 1.65 -6.94) for progression to radical treatment. Ploussard  
reported a series of 96 patients who had low, but not very low risk disease who had undergone 21 core biopsies  
and subsequent erMRI prior to prostatec tomy [57]. This was a T2 -weighted MRI without contrast. Of the 68  
men (82%) with radiographic T1 or T2 disease, 18% had pathologic T3 or T4 disease and 39% had Gleason  
upgrading. These data suggest that in slightly higher risk men, a standard T2 -weighted M RI may be insufficient  
to accurately  reclassify  men considering  AS. 
More specifically, the group from Princess Margaret Hospital reported on a prospective AS protocol in which  
all men received multi -parametric MRI at the time of enrollment to assess its ro le in reclassifying their disease  
[58].  In this study, 60 men with T1c, Gleason 6, PSA <10 ng/mL, ≤3 cores involved and <50% involvement of  
any one core were enrolled. The 1.5 Tesla MRI was interpreted to classify men into three groups: (1) those with  
no visible tumor, (2) those with tumor ≤1 cm in size, and (3) those with tumor >1 cm (used to correspond to  
Epstein criterion for clinically significant disease). Those with either no tumor visible or with a tumor ≤1 cm in  
size were asked to undergo a repeat b iopsy at approximately one year after initial diagnosis. Those with lesions  
larger than 1 cm were asked to undergo an immediate repeat biopsy using a TRUS approach targeting the area  
of interest [59].  Reclassification was defined as Gleason 7, more than 3 positive cores or more than 50% of any  
one core involved.  The overall  reclassification rate  was 32%,  with 77%,  25% and 9% in groups 3,  2, and 1  
respectively. Groups 3 and 2 had a higher mean number of biopsies than group 1 (16.2, 15.3 and 12.3  
respectively). Half of the reclassifications were for Gleason 7 disease on rebiopsy and this finding was  
significantly  more common among  those with larger MRI  lesions.  
Given differences in how the groups were treated in this study, more biopsies in those w ith larger lesions and  
targeted biopsies for those with larger lesions, we aim to further clarify the role of MP -MRI in reclassifying  
men considering AS. We will specifically evaluate the accuracy of MP -MRI relative to standard TRUS biopsy  
as that has rema ined the gold standard for disease classification in men followed on surveillance in the  
published literature. If MP -MRI could replace repeat biopsy for men considering AS, it could have a dramatic  
impact on successfully  selecting  men likely  to safely  rema in on surveillance.  
 
Patient -reported  outcomes  in active  surveillance  
Up to one -third of men who initially opt for AS for management of their low risk prostate cancer may seek  
definitive treatment in the absence of clinical progression; instead citing pati ent preference, progression of  
urinary symptoms such as lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS), or due to anxiety and distress [60 -64]. Van  
den Bergh and colleagues hypothesized that men with prostate cancer on AS, who essentially live with  
untreated disease, may experience overwhelming feelings of anxiety and distress [65]. They found than in a  
population of 150 men with recently diagnosed prostate cancer who had selected AS, that patients reported  
lower anxiety and distress scores than anticipated.  Of the 7% of men who opted to cease AS and move onto  
definitive  therapy  for personal reasons, cited  causes included  anxiety  and fear of prostate cancer

progression[66].  Recently,  AS protocols are  increasingly  incorporating  validated  assessments  of health -related  
quality of life (HRQOL) including urinary and sexual function, as well as psychosocial measures including  
uncertainty, anxiety, distress, satisfaction with cancer care into their evaluations of patients as they prese nt for  
their prostate  cancer monitoring.  
Dall’Era reported that 33 percent of men on AS protocols at large oncology centers in multiple countries will  
subsequently switch to active treatment within 3 -5 years of diagnosis, but also found that patient -reported  
HRQOL outcomes in men on AS are similar or better than those reported by men having undergone immediate  
radical therapy [67].  Kakehi and colleagues found no differences in general HRQOL between men who  
remained on AS and those undergoing r adical prostatectomy after one year [62]. However they did note that the  
men on AS reported worse urinary function, sexual function, and bowel bother scores in comparison to their  
baseline levels after one year.  Arredondo and colleagues found that, over 5 years, decreases were noted in all  
domains of HRQOL in 224 men on AS or watchful waiting [68]. Even when controlling for age, men on  
conservative management regimens appeared to have worsening perception of overall health and sexual  
function. Most recently , Vasarinen and colleagues reported that AS dose not provoke short -term disturbances in  
HRQOL and found that no patients in their series changed treatments due to anxiety; nor did they find changes  
in urinary function by the IPSS or in erectile function us ing the IIEF -5 questionnaire [68]. In comparison to an  
age-stratified Finnish population, patients with prostate cancer on AS reported better general mental and  
physical  HRQOL  at diagnosis  and after 1 year of  follow -up. Although more  recent  studies suggest  that the  
impact of AS on a patient’s overall health and psychosocial wellness may not be as great as was previously  
hypothesized,  evaluation  of patient’s  baseline HRQOL  may predict  better  adherence  with AS in the absence  of 
clinical progression as certain factors such as baseline poor perception of physical health, high neuroticisim  
scores on personality assessments, high depression, and baseline anxiety scores appear to correlate with  
increased likelihood of changing from AS to definitive treatment , even without objective evidence of clinical  
progression [66].  
Indeed, understanding of the morbidity of the surveillance measures employed in prostate cancer AS protocols  
is increasing and the importance of tracking these measures is being increasingly a ppreciated.  Objective  
measurement  of bowel,  bladder, and  erectile  function in  patients  undergoing  serial examination  and biopsy  may 
be helpful in predicting which men may not tolerate AS well, thereby assisting patient counseling and  
facilitating decision -making.  There are few studies which have tracked HRQOL metrics over time in men on  
AS to better understand the magnitude of the role that HRQOL and psychosocial factors play in decision  
making  as well as selection  of treatment choices.  To our knowledge, no  studies  to date  assessing  the 
incorporation of MRI into the patients’ selection calculus for AS have incorporated patient -reported HRQOL in  
their analysis.  
 
2.2 Rationale  
 
In this study, our aim is to determine the sensitivity and specificity of MP-erMRI as it relates to initial re -biopsy  
among men with low -risk disease considering AS. Of the criterion used to take men off of AS, disease extent  
and grade appear to be under -assessed using current approaches. Lacking the full surgical specimens avai lable  
from  prostatectomy,  repeat  biopsies  are the existing  gold standard  for classifying  disease  extent  and grade.  
Comparing MP -MRI to the current standard of care, TRUS biopsy, we will specifically address the role of MP - 
erMRI in assessing men with low -risk disease for AS. We anticipate that the MRI will identify lesions of  
concern in up to one quarter of men. To assess the MRI accuracy, men with non -concerning MRIs and MRIs  
suggesting more extensive or higher -grade disease will both undergo TRUS biopsy. Men whose MRI shows an  
abnormal  lesion  will also  have  an immediate for -cause,  guided biopsy  to assess the  lesion  at the  time of  the 
MRI  in active  surveillance  for prostate  cancer

standard  TRUS biopsy.  This approach  both addresses  the scientific  question  of the  study  and safely  identifies  
men with more  extensive  or aggressive  disease.

4. REGISTRATION  PROCEDURES  
 
4.1 General  Guidelines  for DF/HCC  and DF/PCC  Institutions  
 
Institutions  will register  eligible  participants  with the DF/HCC Quality Assurance Office for  
Clinical Trials (QACT) central  registration system. Registration  must  occur  prior  to the initiation  
of therapy.  Any participant not registered to the  protocol  before treatment begins will be considered  
ineligible  and registration  will be denied.  
 
A member  of the study  team  will confirm  eligibility  criteria  and complete  the protocol -specific  
eligibility  checklist.  
 
Following registration,  participants  may begin  protocol  treatment.  Issues  that would  cause  
treatment  delays  should  be discussed  with the Principal  Investigator.  If a participant  does not receive  
protocol therapy following registration, the participant’s protocol status must be changed. Notify the  
QACT Registrar  of participant  status  changes  as soon  as possible.  
 
4.2 Registration  Process  for DF/HCC  and DF/PCC  Institutions  
 
The QACT  registration  staff is accessible  on Monday  through  Friday,  from  8:00 AM to 5:00 PM Eastern  
Standard Time. In emergency situations when a participant must begin treatment during off -hours or  
holidays, call the QA CT registration line at and follow the instructions for registering  participants  after 
hours.  
 
The registration  procedures  are as follows:  
 
1. Obtain written informed consent from the participant prior to the performance of any study  
related  procedures  or assessments.  
 
2. Complete  the protocol -specific  eligibility  checklist  using  the eligibility  assessment  documented  
in the participant’s medical/research record. To be eligible for registration to the study, the  
participant  must  meet  each inclusion and exclusio n criteria listed  on the eligibility  
checklist.  
 
Reminder: Confirm eligibility for ancillary studies at the same time as eligibility for the  
treatment study. Registration to both treatment and ancillary studies will not be completed if  
eligibility  requirements are  not met for  all studies.  
 
3. Fax the eligibility checklist(s) and all pages of the consent form(s) to the QACT . 
 
4. The QACT  Registrar  will (a) validate  eligibility,  (b) register  the participant  on the study,  and 
(c) randomize  the participant  when  applicable.

5. TREATMENT  PLAN  
 
This is a single arm, prospective protocol investigating the sensitivity and specificity of MP -erMRI in assessing  
disease extent and grade relative to initial re -biopsy in men with low -risk prostate cancer who select AS as their  
initial treatment strategy. Following enrollment and registration, subjects will complete baseline patie nt- 
reported  health state questionnaires.  
Between 2 and 14 months following initial diagnostic biopsy, they will undergo a MP -erMRI.  This will be  
systematically reviewed and men will be characterized into three groups: ( 1) “not reclassified” characterized by 
findings consistent with small, low -Gleason grade organ -confined tumors, ( 2) “reclassified” characterized by  
large, higher -Gleason grade organ -confined tumors, and ( 3) radiographic T3 and/or N1 disease. Those in group  
3 will come off of protocol and pro ceed to management as per their treating physician. Those in groups 1 and 2  
will proceed within 3 months of the MRI to a standard 12 -core TRUS biopsy. For those in group 2 at the time of  
TRUS biopsy, they will also have a for -cause targeted biopsy of the l esion seen on MP -MRI.  All men in groups  
1 and 2 who do not have their disease reclassified with the TRUS biopsy or for -cause biopsy will proceed with  
AS as per their treating physician. Those who are pathologically reclassified will be managed per their tr eating  
physician.  All study participants will come off study after the end of study visit that occurs within 60 days  
following  the final biopsy.  
 
Information  about  participants  will be gathered  according  to the study  calendar.  
 
5.1 Patient -reported  health  states  
 
Participants will be asked to complete patient -reported health state questionnaires at enrollment and  
following the final on -protocol biopsy.  The questionnaire that will be provided to participants for self - 
administration  will include  the following:  
• The Mishel Uncertainty in Illness Scale Community Form for Active Surveillance (MUIS -AS, 
Appendix A).  The MUIS -AS will evaluate  uncertainty,  anxiety,  and distress  associated  with the 
patient’s  cancer diagnosis.  
• The Service Satisfaction Scale for Cancer Care (SSS -Ca, Appendix B).  The SSS -Ca will evaluate  
the patient’s  satisfaction  with both the  process  and outcome  of their cancer related care.  
• The Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite – Clinical Practice (EPIC -CP, Appendix  C). 
The EPIC -CP is used to evaluate urinary and sexual function following treatment for prostate  
cancer.  This will  specifically  be useful  in order to  assess the progression  of urinary  symptoms

overtime  in these  participants  who may be required to  undergo  serial prostate  biopsies, endorectal  
MRI,  etc. 
• The American  Urological  Association  Symptom  Index (AUA  SI, Appendix  D), which  will be used 
to evaluate  overall urinary  bother and function  
 
Questionnaires will be given to participants at their enrollment visit and at the end of study visit following  
biopsy. Participants will be instructed to complete them independently and to return them by mail to the  
project  coordinator.  
 
 
5.2 Multiparametric  MRI  
 
Between 2 -14 months followin g the initial diagnostic biopsy, participants will undergo an endorectal  
prostate MRI. A 2 -month delay from the initial biopsy is preferred to minimize the effects of post -biopsy  
hemorrhage. All MR examinations will be performed on a 3T whole -body scanner possessing a whole - 
body gradient coil set with sufficient strength and speed to perform an optimized MP -MRI, a whole body  
transmit/receive coil, an external rigid phased -array torso coil, and an MR -compatible power injector for  
administering intravenous c ontrast. A compatible endorectal coil will be used for phased -array/ecoil  
measurements. All studies will be obtained with the image plane perpendicular to the rectal wall/prostate  
interface.  
 
5.2.1 Protocol:  
 
5.2.1.1  The standardized  3T pulse  sequences we  will use  will include  fast spin echo  (FSE)  for T2 
weighted -images (FOV: 14 -18cm; slice thickness: 3mm; spacing: 3mm; TR/TE:  
3000/102 msec; Matrix: 384x256; NEX=3). Dynamic Contrast Enhanced (DCE) imaging  
will be performed with 3D -Fast spoiled gradient (FSPGR) image s using FOV: 26 cm;  
slice thickness: 6mm; spacing: 6mm; Matrix: 256x160; contrast (Gadolinium  
gadopentetate (Gd)) injection rate of 3mL/sec; slab thickness 16 -20 slices, 5 sec/volume,  
repeat 60 times, with a total scan time of 5 minutes. Pharmacokinetic an alyses of each  
slice will be performed using a custom research tool (OncoQuant, GE Global Research)  
using a population averaged bi -exponential arterial input function augmented with a first  
pass peak[69]. Single shot echo planar diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) will be  
performed using  b values  of 0 and 500, and  0 and 1400 with trace  ADC maps generated  
at all b values.  
 
5.2.2 Image  Interpretation:  
 
5.2.2.1  Images will be reviewed within the radiology department where the scans were obtained  
as per current protocols and a standard clinical report will be produced. Images will  
subsequently  be analyzed  by study  radiologists  with extensive  experience  in GU imaging.  
The images will be evaluated according to the proposed PIRADS scoring system  
guidelines. This wil l specifically look at signal intensity on T2 weighted image (with a  
discrete, homogenous low signal focus being suspicious for tumor). For DCE, both semi - 
quantitative and quantitative parameters will be evaluated, with particular attention paid  
to the dynamic enhancement curve  type [70]: (  type 1, persistent increase;  type 2, plateau;  
and type 3, decline  after initial upslope; type  3 being  considered the most  suspicious for  
MRI  in active  surveillance  for prostate  cancer

prostate cancer, particularly in the presence of a focal asymmetric enhancing lesion).  
Pharmacokinetic  modeling, which  will produce  quantitative  indices [such  as Ktrans 
(forward volume transfer constant) and ve (fractional extracellular space)], will be  
incorporated into the analysis.  DWI will also be scored according to signal intensity on  
high b value image (≥ b1000) and values obtained on ADC map. Index lesion size will be  
measured  on T2WI  to categorize  those  ≥ or< 1 cm in size. Extracapsular  extension  (ECE)  
and seminal vesicle  invasion (SVI) will  also be evaluated for.  
The interpretation of  the MRI  will place  participants into  the following  categories:  
1. Not-reclassified : any identified abnormality of the MRI is confined to the gland  
without  definitive  evidence  of ECE  or SVI. Additionally,  no lesion  is greater  than 
1 cm in size nor do any identifiable lesions have characteristics of high Gleason  
grade.  
2. Reclassified : Disease appears to be confined to the prostate (no ECE or SVI) but  
one or more lesions appear either >1 cm in size or have imaging  characteristics  
concerning  for higher  Gleason  grade  disease.  
3. T3 or N1: disease appears to be clearly extending outside the prostate and/or into  
the seminal vesicles or there is evidence of pathologic involvement of lymph  
nodes.  
If the  MRI  places  a subject  into the T3/N1  category,  they will meet  criteria for  coming  
off protocol and will then receive further treatment per their treating physician. If a  
participant is in either the not-reclassified or the reclassified categories, they will  
proceed  with the planned  biopsy.  
 
5.3 Prostate  biopsy  
 
All subjects who remain on protocol following the MP -MRI will undergo an on -protocol TRUS biopsy  
within 3 months of the MRI. This biopsy will therefore take place between approximately 2 -17 months  
following  their initial diagnostic biopsy.  
 
5.3.1 Prophylaxis  
 
5.3.1.1  Participants  will be recommended to  receive  oral or IV antibiotic  prophylaxis  according  
the American  Urologic Association Guidelines  
(http://www.auanet.org/content/media/antimicroprop08.pdf)  and as per the standard of  
the institution.  Further, anticoagulant or antiplatelet directed therapy will be managed  
prior to biopsy  as per the standard of  the participating  institution.  
 
5.3.2 TRUS  Biopsy  Sampling  
 
A 12-core biopsy  will be performed  without  specific  targeting  of lesions  noted  at the time 
of MRI.  This approach  is intended  to provide  an unbiased  assessment  of the accuracy  of 
MP-MRI in predicting men reclassified based on the current gold standard TRUS re - 
biopsy. Each core will be individually labeled with laterally and anatomic site within the  
prostate.

5.3.3 Targeted  rebiopsy  
 
Participants in the reclassified category will have both a 12 -core TRUS biopsy unguided  
by the results  of the MRI and a biopsy  targeting  the lesion(s)  of concern  from  the scan.  The 
rationale for doing both biopsies is that to compare the MRI findings to th e current gold - 
standard, a non -targeted TRUS biopsy, we need to include this regardless of the MRI  
findings. Because this biopsy may not capture the lesion noted on the scan, a targeted  
biopsy will be performed at the same time. The targeted biopsy will b e performed  
according to the practices of the treating institution but will generally consist of conscious  
sedation with either an MRI -guided biopsy or a TRUS -guided biopsy directed based on  
images fused to the MRI. The number of cores taken will be at the  discretion of the  
physician performing the biopsy. Standard of care transrectal ultrasound imaging (TRUS)  
may be augmented with the setup needed for spatial tracking of the TRUS images. The  
purpose of this is to facilitate research in spatial mapping biopsy samples within the  
prostate  gland,  and to aid with correlation  of pathology  analysis  of the samples  with TRUS  
and MRI imaging data. The tracking setup would be enabled by a tracking system  
consisting of an electromagnetic field transmitter t hat establishes the coordinate frame for  
tracking volume, and several sensors. The transmitter would be mounted on an articulated  
arm to the patient  bed. One sensor  will be attached  to the handle  of the TRUS  probe  before  
the procedure. The sensor will remain on the handle outside the patient at all times. The  
second sensor will be attached with the medical tape to the back of the patient. Prior to  
TRUS  imaging,  a calibration  procedure  may be necessary.  If needed,  such procedure  would  
involve placing the  TRUS probe in a water bath and imaging of a phantom, prior to the  
patient procedure. This component of the biopsy is not anticipated to add any additional  
risk or toxicity  to the protocol.  
 
 
 
5.3.4 Pathologic  assessment  
 
5.3.4.1  All specimens will be formalin fixed and  paraffin embedded as per usual clinical care.  
Pathology will be reviewed by a pathologist with GU expertise for Gleason grade, disease  
extent, and number of cores positive. Additional features  such as perineural invasion and  
high-grade PIN will be noted though these will not be used to determine continued  
protocol eligibility.  Each of the cores will be labeled for biopsy location at the time of  
procedure and will be individually reported. Patho logy will be reviewed at the treating  
center. Specimens will also be labeled as to whether they came from the TRUS biopsy or  
the targeted biopsy  
 
5.3.4.2  TRUS  Biopsy: Participants will  come  off study  if they  no longer meet  eligibility  criteria  
following  rebiopsy:  
• >3 cores  positive  for cancer  
• >50%  of any single core  containing  cancer  
• any Gleason  >3+3

5.3.4.3  Targeted Biopsy: Participants will be considered pathologically reclassified if either of  
the following  criteria  are met  on the  targeted biopsy:  
• Gleason  >3+3  
• >7mm  of any  core involved with cancer  
In this situation,  using  the criteria  of number  of cores involved  with cancer  will no longer  
be comparable across participants as the number of cores sampled will be variable based  
on the  situation.  
 
5.4 PSA  
 
During  the time that  participants  are on study,  a PSA will be  drawn as  per the treating  physician  
(typically every 3 -6 months). A change in PSA will not be a criterion for discontinuation of this  
protocol though may be used clinically to change management at the discretion of the treating  
physician.  
 
5.5 Duration  of Follow  Up/End  of Study  Visit  
 
Participants will also be followed until their final study visit which will occur up to 60 days after the  
final biopsy.  
5.6 Criteria  for Removal  from  Study  
Participants  will be  removed from the  study  when  any of the  criteria in section 5.3.3 or  5.3.4  applies.  
Additional  criteria  for removal  from the  study:  
• Participant  withdraws  from the  study  
• The patient proceeds to  prostate -cancer directed therapy  
• Death  from  any cause  
• General  or specific  changes  in the participant’s condition  which  render  them  unacceptable  for 
completion  of the protocol in the  opinion of  the treating  investigator.  
• Intercurrent  illness  that prevents  completion  of the protocol  
• Investigator  discretion  
 
6. EXPECTED  TOXICITIES  AND  DOSING  DELAYS/DOSE  MODIFICATIONS  
 
Toxicity assessments will be done using  CTEP  Version 4.0 of the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for  
Adverse Events (CTCAE) which is identified and located on the CTEP website at:  
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm . 
 
If possible,  symptoms  should  be manage d symptomatically. In  the case of toxicity,  appropriate  medical  
treatment  should be used  (including  anti-emetics, anti -diarrheals,  etc.).  
 
All adverse events experienced by participants will be collected from the time of the  enrollement, through  
the study and until the final study visit. Participants continuing to experience toxicity at the off study visit  
may be contacted for  additional assessments until  the toxicity  has resolved  or is deemed irreversible.

Occasional  (occurring  in 1 or 2 our of  100 participants)  
• persistent  bleeding  (1-2%) 
• urinary  retention (<1%)  
• infection  requiring  hospitalization  (1-2%) 
 
6.1.2 MRI  
 
Participants  may experience  frustration  or anxiety  related  to the  time spent  obtaining  the MRI.  
Participants will also be at risk of the typical reactions from MRI with gadolinium contrast  
administration:  
Occasional  (occurring  2 or 3 out  of 100 participants)  
• Mild  nausea  (with  or without  vomiting),  tingling  sensation, headache,  dizziness,  coldness  at 
the injection site, headache, warmth or pain at the injection site, paresthesias, dizziness and  
itching.

8. ADVERSE  EVENT  REPORTING  REQUIREMENTS  
 
 
8.1 Definitions  
 
8.1.1 Adverse  Event  (AE)  
 
An adverse  event  (AE)  is any undesirable  sign,  symptom  or medical  condition  or experience  that 
develops or worsens in severity after starting the first dose of study treatment or any procedure  
specified  in the  protocol,  even if  the event  is not considered  to be related  to the study.  
 
Abnormal laboratory  values or diagnostic test results constitute  adverse  events only  if they  
induce  clinical signs  or symptoms  or require  treatment or  further  diagnostic  tests.  
 
8.1.2 Serious  adverse  event  (SAE)  
 
A serious adverse  event  (SAE)  is any  adverse  event, occurring  at any dose and regardless of  
causality  that: 
• Results  in death  
• Is life-threatening.  Life-threatening  means  that the person  was at immediate  risk of death  
from the reaction as it occurred, i.e., it does not include a reaction which hypothetically  
might  have caused  death  had it occurred in  a more  severe  form.  
• Requires or prolongs inpatient hospitalization (i.e., the event required at least a 24 -hour 
hospitalization or prolonged a hospitalization beyond the expected length of stay).  
Hospitalization admissions and/or surgical operations scheduled to occur during the study  
period, but  planned prior to study entry are not considered SAEs if the illness or disease  
existed  before the  person  was enrolled  in the trial,  provided  that it did not deteriorate  in 
an unexpected manner during  the trial (e.g.,  surgery  performed earlier  than planned ). 
• Results  in persistent  or significant  disability/incapacity.  Disability  is defined  as a 
substantial  disruption  of a person’s  ability  to conduct  normal life  functions.  
• Is a congenital  anomaly  or birth  defect; or  
• Is an important medical event when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, it may  
jeopardize  the participant  and require  medical  or surgical  intervention  to prevent  one of 
the outcomes listed above. Examples of such medical events include allergic  
bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home; blood  
dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalization, or the  
development of drug  dependency  or drug  abuse.  
 
Events  not considered  to be serious  adverse  events  are hospitalizations  for: 
• routine treatment or monitoring of the studied indication, not associated with any  
deterioration  in condition, or  for elective  procedures  
• elective  or pre-planned  treatment  for a pre-existing  condition  that did not worsen  
• emergency  outpatient  treatment for  an event  not fulfilling  the serious  criteria  outlined  
above  and not resulting  in inpatient admission

8.1.3 Expectedness  
 
Adverse  events  can be 'Expected'  or 'Unexpected.'  
 
8.1.3.1  Expected  adverse  event  
 
Expected  adverse  events  are those  that have  been  previously  identified  as resulting  from  
administration of the agent. For the purposes of this study, an adverse event is  
considered expected  when it appears in the current adverse event list, the Investigator’s  
Broch ure, the package insert or is included in the informed consent document as a  
potential risk.  
 
Refer  to Section  6.1 for a listing  of expected  adverse  events  associated  with the study  
agent(s).  
 
8.1.3.2  Unexpected  adverse  event  
 
For the purposes of this study, an adverse event is considered unexpected  when it varies  
in nature, intensity or frequency from information provided in the current adverse event  
list, the Investigator’s Brochure, the package insert or when it is not includ ed in the  
informed  consent document as a  potential risk.  
 
8.1.4 Attribution  
 
Attribution is the relationship between an adverse event or serious adverse event and the study  
treatment.  Attribution will be  assigned  as follows:  
 
• Definite  – The AE is clearly  related  to the  study  treatment.  
• Probable  – The AE is likely  related  to the  study  treatment.  
• Possible – The AE may be related  to the study  treatment.  
• Unlikely - The AE is doubtfully related  to the study  treatment.  
• Unrelated  - The AE is clearly  NOT  related  to the study  treatment.  
 
8.2 Procedures  for AE and SAE  Recording  and Reporting  
 
Participating  investigators  will assess  the occurrence  of AEs and SAEs  at all participant  evaluation  
time points during  the study.  
 
All AEs and SAEs whether reported by the participant, discovered during questioning, directly  
observed,  or detected  by physical  examination, laboratory  test or other  means, will be  recorded in  the 
participant’s  medical record  and on  the appropriate  study -specific case  report  forms .

The descriptions and grading scales found in the revised NCI Common Terminology Criteria for  
Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0 will be utilized for AE reporting. All appropriate treatment  
areas  should have  access  to a copy  of the CTCAE  version 4.0.  
A copy of the CTCAE version 4.0 can be downloaded from the CTEP website at:  
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ ctc.htm . 
 
8.3 Reporting  to the Study  Sponsor  
 
8.3.1 Serious  Adverse  Event  Reporting  
 
All serious adverse events that occur after the initial  study procedure,  or within 30 days of the  
last study  procedure  treatment  must  be reported  to the DF/HCC  Overall  Principal  Investigator  on 
the local institutional SAE form. This includes events meeting the criteria outlined in Section  
11.1.2,  as well as the following:  
 
• Grade 2 (moderate) and Grade 3 (severe) Events – Only events that are unexpected and  
possibly,  probably  or definitely  related/associated  with the  intervention.  
 
• All Grade 4 (life -threatening or disabling) Events – Unless expected AND specifically  
listed  in the  protocol  as not requiring reporting.  
 
• All Grade  5 (fatal)  Events  – When  the participant  is enrolled  and actively  participating  in 
the trial OR when the event  occurs within 30 days  of the  last study  intervention.  
 
Note : If the participant  is in long term follow up,  report  the death  at the time of continuing  
review.  
 
Participating investigators must report each serious adverse event to the DF/HCC Overall  
Principal Investigator within 24 business hours of learning of the occurrence. In the event that  
the participating investigator does not become aware of the serious ad verse event immediately  
(e.g.,  participant  sought  treatment  elsewhere),  the participating  investigator is  to report  the event  
within 24 business hours after learning of it and document the time of his or her first awareness  
of the adverse  event. Report serious adverse  events by  telephone, email or facsimile  to: 
 
Within the following 24 -48 business hours, the participating investigator must provide follow -up 
information on the serious adverse event. Follow -up information should describe whether the  
event has resolved or continues, if and how the event was treated, and whether the participant  
will continue  or discontinue  study  participation.

8.3.2 Non-Serious  Adverse  Event  Reporting  
 
Non-serious  adverse  events  will be reported  to the DF/HCC  Overall Principal Investigator  on the 
toxicity  Case  Report  Forms.  
 
8.4 Reporting  to the Institutional  Review Board  (IRB)  
 
Investigative  sites within  DF/HCC will report  all serious  adverse  events  directly  to the DFCI  Office for  
Human  Research Studies (OHRS).  
 
Other investigative sites should report serious adverse events to their respective IRB according to the  
local IRB’s policies and procedures in reporting adverse events. A copy of the submitted institutional  
SAE  form should be forwarded to:  
 
 
The DF/HCC Principal Investigator will submit SAE reports from outside institutions to the DFCI  
Office for Human Research Studies (OHRS) according to DFCI IRB policies and procedures in  
reporting  adverse  events.  
 
8.5 Reporting  to Hospital  Risk Management  
 
Participating investigators will report to their local Risk Management office any subject safety reports  
or sentinel events that require  reporting  according to institutional  policy.  
 
8.6 Monitoring  of Adverse  Events  and Period  of Observation  
 
All a dverse events, both serious and non -serious, and deaths that are encountered from initiation of  
study intervention, throughout the study, and within 30 days of the last study intervention should be  
followed to their resolution, or until the participating i nvestigator assesses them as stable, or the  
participating investigator determines the event to be irreversible, or the participant is lost to follow -up. 
The presence and resolution of AEs and SAEs (with dates) should be documented on the appropriate  
case report  form  and recorded  in the participant’s  medical  record  to facilitate  source  data verification.  
 
For some SAEs, the study sponsor or designee may follow -up by telephone, fax, and/or monitoring  
visit to obtain  additional  case details  deemed necessary  to appropriately  evaluate  the SAE report  (e.g.,  
hospital  discharge  summary, consultant report, or  autopsy  report).  
 
Participants should be instructed to report any serious post -study event(s) that might reasonably be  
related to participation in t his study. Participating investigators should notify the DF/HCC Overall  
Principal Investigator and their respective IRB of any unanticipated death or adverse event occurring  
after a  participant has discontinued  or terminated study  participation that  may reasonably  be related  to 
the study.

11. STATISTICAL  CONSIDERATIONS  
 
 
11.1 Study  Design/Primary  Objective  
The primary objective is to determine the sensitivity and specificity of Mp -erMRI relative to repeated standard  
12-core TRUS biopsy for  classifying upgrading of disease extent or Gleason grade in men considering AS. We  
hypothesize MP -erMRI prior to AS for men with low risk disease ca n identify men who harbor more extensive  
or higher risk prostate  cancer.  
 
The study  will plan to  enroll 130 participants  who had diagnostic biopsy  less than  one year prior to  enrollment.  
After enrollment, participants will undergo a MP -erMRI.  This will be reviewed and participants will be  
characterized into 3 groups: “not reclassified” characterized by findings consistent with small, low -Gleason  
grade  organ -confined  tumors, “re classified” characterized  by large,  higher -Gleason  grade  organ-confined  
tumors, and radiographic T3 and or N1 disease. Less than 10% (roughly 10) of participants who belong to group  
3 will be taken off study. Those in groups 1 and 2 will proceed within 3 months of the MP -erMRI to a standard  
12-core TRUS biopsy.  
 
11.2 Hypothesis  assumptions:  
Participants in groups 1 and 2 will receive 12 core TRUS re -biopsy within 3 months of undergoing MP -erMRI.  
TRUS  re-biopsy  will be  assumed as the  gold standard for  determining  tumor  size and grade.  
 
11.2.1  Null hypothesis:  
 TRUS  Re-biopsy  Results   
MP-erMRI  Results  No Disease  Upgrade  Disease  Upgrade  Total  
Not Reclassified  72 9 81 
Reclassified  18 (20%)  21 (70%)  39 
Total  90 30 120 
 
11.2.2  Alternative  hypothesis:  
 TRUS  Re-biopsy  Results   
MP-erMRI  Results  No Disease  Upgrade  Disease  Upgrade  Total  
Not Reclassified  85 3 88 
Reclassified  5 (6%)  27 (90%)  32 
Total  90 30 120 
 
 
11.3 Power  and sample  size calculation:  
A true positive fraction (TPF) is defined as the probability of MP -erMRI tests show disease re -classified results  
when participants truly have upgraded disease according to 12 core TRUS re-biopsies. A false positive fraction  
(FPF) is defined as the probably of MP -erMRI tests show re -classified disease results when no upgrade disease  
was observed on 12 core TRUS re -biopsies. A TPF (sensitivity) of 90% and FPF (1 -specificity) of 6% would be  
considered promising, whereas a TPF of ≤70% and a FPF of ≥20% are unacceptable. Sample size is calculated  
using the formula with asymptotic variances as proposed by Pepe [71], followed by a set of 5000 simulation to  
assess that the power is adequate. Simulation was done using STATA scrsize package  
(http://labs.fhcrc.or g/pepe/dabs/software.html).  Results  showed  that with 120 participants (25%  have  upgrade

re-biopsy vs. biopsy prior to enrollment), 81% power can be achieved (1 -sided alpha 0.1). This ensures that  
there  is at least 80%  chance  of drawing  a positive  conclusion if  the MP -MRI  is 94% speci fic and 90% sensitive.  
 
11.4 Primary  Analysis:  
The observed TPF and FPF will be summarized as percentages with 90% CI.  Joint CIs for TPF and FPF will  
also be examined.  A positive  conclusion is  drawn  if the lower  limit of TPF  is above  the minimally  acceptable  
level of 70% and the upper limit of FPF is below the minimally acceptable level of 20%. Table below gives  
80% confidence intervals for the true but unknown TPF and FPF, given possible observed participants with  
reclassified disease by MRI among 30 true reclassified and 90 non -reclassified cases (by re -biopsy).  Table  
below  is an example  of 80% CI  given  different scenarios observed reclassified  participants  number.  
Disease Upgrade by  Re-biopsy  (n=30)  No Upgrade by  Re-biopsy  (N=90)  
Observed

N by MRI  Observed  
TPF 80% CI Observed  
Reclassified  
N by MRI  Observed  
FPR 80% CI 
27 90% (79%,  96%)  5 6% (3%,  10%)  
25 83% (71%,  92%)  10 11% (7%,  17%)  
23 77% (64%,  87%)  15 17% (12%,  23%)  
21 70% (57%,  81%)  18 20% (15%,  26%)  
 
11.5 Secondary  Objectives  
Determine  the frequency  of MP-erMRIs  which appear  to reclassify  men with  low risk  disease  considering  AS. 
Determine  the effect  of MP-erMRI  and repeated  12 core TRUS  biopsy  on patient -reported health states.  
Correlate  the pathology  findings from the  targeted  biopsy  with the  MP-erMRI  findings for  those  men who fall  
into the reclassified  category.  
 
11.6 Secondary  Analysis  
Secondary analysis will be summarized descriptively. Number and percentage of participants with reclassified  
disease by MP -erMRI will be summarized as numbers and percentages with 90% CI. Participants will be asked  
to complete  self-reported  health  state questionnaires  at enrollment  and following  the final  on-protocol  biopsy.  
A score will be given for each question naire answered by participants.  The scores for the questionnaires will be  
summarized as median and inter -quartile ranges.  Descriptive statistics will be utilized to correlate the targeted  
biopsy  findings (disease  extent in  mm and Gleason score) with the  findings  from  the MP -erMRI.

2 INTRODUCTION AND STUDY RATIONALE  
 
As few as half of sexually active youth used a condom the last time they had sex, and 14% did not use any form of 
contraception at last intercourse (Kann et al., 2018) . This risky behav ior can have lasting consequences. As many 
as one in four sexually active girls has a sexually transmitted disease (STD; Centers for Disease Con trol and 
Prevention [CDC], 2018c; Forhan et al., 2009) , which can increase the risk of HIV and infertility (CDC, 2018b) . 
Further, adolescent boys, particularly young men who have sex with men, are at heightened risk of HIV and other 
STDs, with recent data showing that 17% of new HIV infections occur among young boys and men under t he age 
of 24 (CDC, 2018a) . 
 
New approaches are needed to engage youth in HIV prevention to curb the spread of HIV/STDs. Online, 
technology -based sexual health programs, als o known as eHealth, mHealth, and digital health programs, are one 
promising tool that can be used (Lightfoot, 2012; Rapoff, 2013) . Technology use is now ubiquitous among youth: 
95% of U.S. teens have access to a smartphone and ne arly half of these youth report they are online “almost 
constantly” (Smith & Anderson, 2018) . Thus, online sexual health programs may be a particularly relevant way to 
offer information and teach skills to youth in a way that is readily available, familiar , non -threatening, and intuitive.  
 
The number of online sexual health programs targeting youth has been steadily increasing for the past decade (for 
reviews, see Chavez et al., 2014; Swanton et al., 2015; Widman, Nesi, et al., 201 8). Yet to our knowledge, there 
are no brief online interventions that provide evidence -based sex education and are tested and found effective for 
diverse samples of both boys and girls. Such a program, particularly one shown to be efficacious among such 
diverse s amples, could be of significant interest to schools or community programs that would benefit from a 
general program that is appropriate for a wide audience of youth with diverse identities.  
 
The purpose of this study is to provide an initial evaluation of one such program, called Health Education and 
Relationship Training for Teens (HEART for Teens). This brief online program was adapted from a program we 
originally developed for adolescent girls, called HEART for Girls (Widman, Golin, Noar, Massey, & Prinstein, 
2016) .  
 
3 STUDY AIMS  
 
Aim 1: Evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of the HEART for Teens program.  
 
Aims 2: Evaluate the prelim inary efficacy of the HEART for Teens program in a randomized controlled trial of youth 
from a rural school district in the southeastern U.S.  
 
4 STUDY DESIGN  
 
4.1 Randomized Controlled Trial  
 
 A two-arm randomized controlled trial . Arm 1:  HEART intervention ; Arm 2: attention -matched controlled 
program, called Growing Minds  (Burnette et al., 2018). Participants will be assessed at pre -test and 
immediate -post test.  
 
4.2 Study Population  
 
All 10 th and 11 th grade students from a school district in the southeastern U.S. will be recruited to participation in 
this study ( n recruited = 754).

  4.2.1    Inclusion C riteria  
1. Must be a 10 th or 11 th grade student  
2. Must speak  English  
3. Provide written parental consent  
4. Provide written student assent  
 
4.2.2 Exclusio n Criteria  
1. Unable to speak fluent English  
2. Unwilling or unable to provide parent  consent or student assent  
 
5  QUALTRICS  DATA COLLECTION  
  
All data collected will be directly entered and stored in the web -based Qualtics research electronic data  system . 
This Qualtics  database will be stored, maintained, and monitored by the NC State Office of Information 
Technology and the study personnel. The Qualtircs  system is a secure, web -based application designed to 
support survey and data collection. NC State  has a license to host the Qualtrics  system. Access to the Qualtrics  
database will be carefully restricted to authorized research team members as needed to perform their job 
functions, pursuant to Federal regulations.   
 
6  RECRUITMENT  
 
Potential study participants will be recruited via in -class announcements at their high school. Students will be 
provided with an informed consent document to take home to their parent/guardian. Parents are asked to sign 
and return the for m to indicate whether child is approved to par ticipate in the study. All students in the 10 th and 
11th grades will be recruited.  
 
7 INFORMED CONSENT  
 
Written informed consent from parents will be collected via an IRB -approved informed consent document. Once 
parental consent is collected, study staff w ill explain the study to students and also provide them with a written 
assent form approved by the NC State IRB. Students  will be a llowed sufficient tim e to ask questions about the 
study  and express understanding . Only students who have received parental c onsent and have signed an 
assent document will be allowed to participate in the study. W ritten consent /assent  documentation  will be store d 
in a secure physical or electronic server  location  according to stand ard operations approved by the NC State  
IRB.  
 
8  DATA COLLECTION PROCEDURES  
 
After parental consent and student assent are obtained, pre -test data will be collected using computerized 
Qualtrics surveys in a small group classroom setting. Participants will then be randomly assigned to either the 
HEART for Teens online program or to an attention -matched control program focused on cultivating academic 
growth mindsets, called Growing Minds (Burnette, Russell, Hoyt, Orvidas, & Widman, 2017) . Random 
assignment to study condition will be conducted using random sampling and allocation procedures in SPSS 
version 24. Participants will be stratified based on sexual activity status (ever sexually active versus never 
sexually active). Approximately one week after pre -test, participants will complete the online intervention on a 
study -provided netbook computer as well as a computerized  Qualtics post -test survey in a small group 
classroom setting. Participants will use headphones to listen to program content and to control for any outside 
noise.

 9  PARTICIPANT REIMBURSEMENT  
 
Participants will be compensated with a $10 gift card for the pre -test assessment and a $10 gift card for the 
intervention and immediate post -test assessment.  
 
10 MEASURES  
 
10.1 Participant Characteristics.  Demographic data w ill be collected on participan t gender, age, race/ethnicity, 
sexual orientation, and receipt of free or reduced -price lunch (a proxy for socioeconomic status). Sexual activity 
status w ill be assessed with two items: one that inquired if participants had ever engaged in any sexual activ ity, 
including sexual touching, oral sex, and/or intercourse; and a second, if they answered “yes” to the first question, 
that inquired if participants had ever engaged in sexual intercourse. Additionally, among those who reported 
sexual intercourse, infor mation was gathered about condom use at last sex.  
 
10.2 Program Acceptability.  Program acceptability w ill be assessed through a questionnaire that was adapted 
from prior acceptability surveys (Bauermeister et al., 2015; Widman et al., 2017) . Specifically, six items w ill be 
included to assess six aspects of acceptability: 1) how much participants liked the program; 2) how much they 
learned from the program; 3) how much they felt the program kept their attention; 4) whether they would use 
information from the program in the f uture; 5) whether the program would be useful for girls their age; and 6) 
whether the program would be useful for boys their age. Items are rated on a four -point Likert scale ranging from 0 
(not at all ) to 3 ( a lot).  
 
10.2 Intentions.  Intentions to discuss sexual health and to use condoms w ill be assessed with two items. The first 
asks how likely teens are to discuss sexual health issues, including pregnancy and STDs, with their partner(s) 
prior to sexual activity (communication intentions). The othe r item ask s how likely teens are to use condoms the 
next time they have sex (condom intentions). Participants w ill be prompted to answer these questions whether or 
not they had engaged in sexual activity before. Response options range from 0 ( not at all li kely) to 4 ( very likely ). 
 
10.2 Sexual Self-Efficacy.  The Self -Efficacy for HIV Prevention Scale (Brown et al., 2014)  will be used to assess 
self-efficacy about communication and condom use. Six items assess confidence communicating about sexual 
topics (e.g., “How sure are you that you could ta lk to your partner about safer sex?”). Two items assess confidence 
obtaining and using condoms (e.g., “How sure are you that you could have condoms available when you need 
them?”).  Participants responded from 1 ( Couldn’t do it ) to 4 ( Very Sure ), with higher scores indicating greater 
sexual self -efficacy.  
 
10.3 Knowledge.  HIV/STD knowledge w ill be assessed with 9 items (e.g., “ STDs usually have noticeable 
symptoms, like itching or burning”).  Participants rate each item as True, False , or Don’t Know. Responses are 
recoded as 0 ( Incorrect or Don’t Know ) or 1 ( Correct ). Scores are summed to reflect the total number of correct 
HIV/STD knowledge questions (possible range=0 -9).  
 
10.4 Condom Attitudes.  Participants’ attitudes about condoms w ill be assessed with the 3 -item effect on sexual 
experiences subscale of the Condom Attitudes  Scale Adolescent Version (St. Lawrence et al., 1994) . An example 
item includes, “Condoms take away the pleasure of sex.” Responses are on a scale from 1 ( Strongly Disagree ) to 
5 (Strongly Agree ).  
 
10.5 Condom Norms . The 3 -item condom norm subscale from the Sexual Risk Behavior Beliefs and Self -Efficacy 
Scale for adolescents (Basen -Engquist et al., 1999)  will be used to assess participants’ perceptions o f their peers’ 
views of condom use. Participants respond from 1 ( Strongly Disagree ) to 5 ( Strongly Agree ) to items such as, 
“Most teenagers believe condoms should always be used if a person my age has sex”.

 10.6 Sexual Assertiveness . Self-reported sexual assertiveness w ill be assessed with 3 -items from the 
Multidimensional Sexual Self -Concept Scale (Snell, 1998) . Items such as, “ I’m very assertive about the sexual 
aspects of my life, ” are rated on a scale from 1 ( Strongly Disagree ) to 5 ( Strongly Agre e).   
 
11  STATISTICAL ANALYSIS STRATEGY  
 
11.1 Analysis Plan  
 
First, descriptive statistics will be utilized to summarize sociodemographic variables and pre -test levels of each 
outcome variable. To establish pre -test equivalence, differences between groups will be assessed using t-tests for 
continuous variables and 2-tests for categorical variables. Second, to assess the efficacy of the HEART 
intervention from pre -test to immediate post -test, linear regression analyses will be utilized to compute adjusted 
means and mean differences between intervention and control gr oups. For each outcome, the corresponding pre -
test measure will be included as a covariate. Third, moderation analyses will be conducted to examine if 
intervention effects are moderated by gender or sexual orientation. Cohen’s d value will be calculated as  an 
indication of effect size. Analyses will be completed using SPSS Version 24.  
 
11.2 Sample Size Considerations   
 
For this preliminary assessment, the final sample size will be determined by the number of students and parents 
who granted consent.  
 
12 STUDY CONDUCT  
 
12.1  Ethics  
 
This study will be conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practice (GCP), as defined by the International 
Conference on Harmonization  (ICH) and in accordance with the ethical principles underlying European Union 
Directive 2001/20/EC and the United Stat es Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Part 50 (21CFR50).  
 
The study will be c onducted in compliance with this protocol. The protocol and any amendments and the subject 
informed consent will receive Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval  prior to ini tiation of the study.  
 
Any serious breach to the study protocol or principles of GCP in connection with the study or the prot ocol which 
are likely to affect the physical or mental safety of study participants or the integrity of the study  will be reported 
to the NC State  IRB. 
 
Personnel involved in conducting this study will be qualified by education, training, and experience to perform 
their respective tasks.  
 
12.2  Responsibilities within the Study  
  
The study shall be conducted as desc ribed in this approved protocol and research staff will not implement any 
deviation or change to the protocol without prior approval from the NC State  IRB and sponsor . 
 
12.3  Reports and Publications  
 
The confidentiality of rec ords that could identify part icipants  within the database will be protected, respecting the 
privacy and confidentiality rules in accordance with the applicable regulatory requirement(s). The data collected 
during this study are confidential and proprietary to NC State .

12.4  Databas e Retention and Archiving  
 
The database and s upporting documentation will be maintained by the PI and research staff in electronic files 
on a secure server accessed only by authorized personnel. The database and s tudy reco rds will be maintained 
for at l east 5 years after study completion.  
 
13 DATA SAFETY MONITORING BOARD (DSMB)  
 
No DSMB  was established.  
 
14 DATA AND STUDY MONITORING PLAN (DSMP)  
 
The research team will meet weekly or as often as necessary to review and monitor all aspects of the study: 
recruitment, data collection, completeness, data quality, protocol deviations, and any reported study -related 
adverse events.  Study staff will be responsible for database integrity checks, data retrieval and  export.  
 
15 PATIENT SAFETY AND MONITORING PLAN (PSMP)  
 
15.1  Risks of Study Participation  
 
The psychological risk s directly posed by participating in this study are judged to be minimal and  rare (<1%). 
One risk of participating in this study is that participants may feel uncomfortable answering sensitive questions 
about their attitudes or private/illegal behaviors (e.g., sexual activity). To reduce this risk, we will inform students 
that they do not have to answer any questions that they do not want t o answer.  They will be told that they can 
skip any items that make them uncomfortable or stop their participation at any time. Participants can also speak 
with members of the research team if they become upset, and/or the research team can provide student s with 
referrals if  they would like to speak with someone about any of the information they receives as part of this 
program.  
 
Another risk of participating is that the data we are collecting is sensitive and must be carefully protected to 
ensure confiden tiality. Several steps will be taken to protect participant survey data and academic records. This 
includes deidentifying all data by using only a participant ID number, and not the participant's name. We will 
also store data in password -protected files on  our secure server. The spreadsheet linking participant names 
with ID numbers will be stored in a separate file from participant data and secured with a separate password. 
Only the PI, Co -Investigator, and Project Manager will have access to this spreadshe et.   
 
15.2  Handling of N on-Study Related H arms  or Adverse Events  
 
Non-study related issues w ill not be reportable to the NC State  IRB. For instance, t he research team  may 
become aware of a patient’s medical or psych iatric  issue during the survey assessment  even though 
unsolicited . The r esearch staff will explain to the student  that research  is a separate activity from clinical care 
and will encourage the student to notify the ir physician of their concern. In the event  that a student  expresses an 
urgent matter or a crisis ( e.g., suicidality ), the research team will be trained to use good clinical judgement and 
the standard operating procedure (SOP) which has been  developed for staff . 
 
15.3  Handling of Study-related harms or unanticip ated adverse events  
 
Adverse events  (AEs)  directly related to answering survey questions is expected to be extremely rare  (<1%) . 
Nonetheless, s hould a n unanticipated study -related adverse even occur that is judged by the PI to be partially 
or fully related to study participation, the event will be reported to the NC State  IRB within 72 hours . 
8 
HEART for Teens Protocol  
October 16, 2019  
 
 
 
 Unanticipated study -related AE’s may be physical, psychological, social, or legal in nature. Study-related harms 
or unanticipated AE’s will b e tracked by research staff and included  in a final progress report to the sponsor.

Study design 
This study will be an open- label, 2 -part, absorption, metabolism, excretion (AME) and 
absolute bioavailability study of [14C]-LOXO-305. Subjects in Part 1 will not participate in 
Part 2, nor will subjects in Part 2 participate in Part 1. Part 1 and Part 2 are independent of 
each other and do not need to be conducted in sequential order. Part 1 is desig ned to evaluate the AME profiles of LOXO-305, to identify and characterize 
metabolites of LOXO -305, and to assess the safety and tolerability of [
14C]-LOXO-305. 
Subjects in Part 1 will be administered a single oral dose of 200  mg of [14C]-LOXO-305 
(containing ~200 µCi)  as an oral solution.  
Part 2 is designed to determine the absolute bioavailability  of LOXO-305, to evaluate the 
plasma concentration of total radioactivity , to evaluate the urinary excretion of 
[14C]-LOXO-305 and total radioactivity , to e valuate the fecal excretion of  [14C]-LOXO-305 
and total radioactivity , and to assess the safety and tolerability of LOXO -305 and 
[14C]-LOXO-305. Subjects in Part 2 will be administered a single oral dose of 200 mg  
LOXO-305 as 2 × 100-mg tablets followed 2 hours later by a single dose of < 100 µg of 
[14C]-LOXO-305 (containing ~1  µCi of radioactivity [microtracer] ) administered as an IV 
push over approximately 2 minutes.  Six subjects will participate  in each part of the study, such that a total of 12 subjects will be 
evaluated in the study. Each subject will participate in either Part 1 or Part 2, but not both. In 
the event of early  withdrawal of any subjects and/or in order to ensure 6 subjects complete 
each part of the study, replacement subjects may be enrolled at the discretion of the Sponsor.  
The start of the study is defined as the earliest date a su bject who is enrolled in either part of 
the study signs an Informed Consent Form (ICF). Note that enrolled subjects are defined as 
those subjects who are assigned a dose of study drug; this definition excludes screen failure subjects. A subject who completes sufficient total radioactivity  recovery and metabolite  
sample collection  (Part 1 only), or LOXO-305 and [
14C]-LOXO -305 (Part 2 only) sampling 
prior to Clinic Discharge is considered to have completed the study. The end of the study is defined as the latest date a subject receives the Follow-up Call. The planned duration of study conduct for Part 1 is up to 60 days from Screening through the Foll ow-up Call. The planned 
duration of study conduct for Part 2 is up to 47 days from Screening through the Follow-up Call.

Protocol Version 1.0, 29 June 2020 Page 8 of 69 Part 1:  
After a Screening period of up to 28 days, subjects will check in to the Clinical Research Unit 
(CRU) on Day -1 to confirm eligibility and to become familiar with study procedures. On the 
morning of Day 1, following an overnight fast of at least 10  hours, subjects will receive a 
single oral dose of 200 mg of [14C]-LOXO- 305 (containing ~200 µCi) administered as an oral 
solution. Subjects will be confined at the CRU from the time of Check -in (Day -1) until 
Clinic Discharge (between Days 12  and 22). After comp leting discharge procedures, subjects 
will be discharge d from the CRU as early as Day 12  and up to Day 22, provided recovery of 
radioactivity has reached the following threshold values : 
• Plasma radioactivity below the limit of quantification for 2 consecutive collections, and 
• ≥ 90% of the radioactive dose is recovered, and  
• ≤ 1% of the radioactive dose per day is recovered in excreta (urine and feces) for 
3 consecutive days on which a fecal sample is collected.   
Sample collection and CRU confinement will continue until discharge criteria are met or the 
maximum stay is reached, unless otherwise agreed upon by the Sponsor and Investigator (or designee) . Subjects will receive a Safety Follow -up Call approximately 7 days after Clinic 
Discharge.  
Sampl es for deter mination of LOXO -305 concentrations in plasma, total radioactivity 
concentrations in plasma, whole blood, urine, and feces, and for metabolite profiling/characterization will be obtained through at least 264 hours postdose (Day 12 ), and 
possibly up to 504 hours postdose (Day 22). 
Part 2:  
After a Screening period of up to 28 days, subjects will check in to the CRU on Day -1 to confirm eligibility and to become familiar with study procedures. On the morning of Day 1, following  an overnight fast of at least 10  hours , subjects will receive a single oral dose of 
200 mg of LOXO-305 as 2 × 100- mg tablets and  followed 2 hours later by a single dose of 
< 100 µg  of [
14C]-LOXO-305 (containing ~1 µCi of radioactivity [microtracer] ) administered 
as an IV push over approximately 2  minutes . Subjects will be confined at the CRU from the 
time of Check -in (Day -1) until Day 9 and will be discharged from the CRU after completing 
all discharge procedures. Subjects will receive a Follow -up Call approximately 7 days  after 
Clinic Discharge.  
Samples for determination of LOXO -305 in plasma , and [14C]-LOXO-305 and total 
radioactivity  concentrations in plasma, urine, and feces will be obtained through 192 hours 
postdose (Day 9). 
Both Parts : 
In this study, physical examinations, 12- lead electrocardiograms  (ECGs ), vital sign  
measurement s, How Do You Feel? (HDYF?) inquiries, clinical chemistry panel, coagulation

Protocol Version 1.0, 29 June 2020 Page 9 of 69 medications will be performed at specified times during the study (for specific timepoints and 
details on each study variable, refer to  Appendix 4). Adverse events  (AEs)  and serious AEs 
(SAEs ) will be collected beginning at informed consent. Adverse events will be reported 
throughout the study (ie, from signing of the ICF until End of Study [EOS], or until Early Termination [ET] if the subject discontinues from the study and does not complete a Follow- up Phone Call), either as subject medical history (if the event is reported as beginning 
prior to signing of the ICF or if the event occurs prior to study drug administration on Day 1 and is assessed as not related to study procedures by the Investigator [or designee]) or as AEs (if the event occurs after signing of the ICF but prior to study drug administration on Day 1 and is assessed as related to study procedures by the Investigator [or designee], or if the event occurs after study drug administration on Day 1 through End of Treatment [EOT] or ET regardless of relationship to study drug). From EOT or ET through EOS , only AEs assessed 
as related to study drug by the Investigator (or designee) are to be reported. All SAEs that develop from the time of ICF signing until EOS (or ET, if the subject discontinues from the study and does not complete a Follow-up Phone Call) are to be reported. Study completion is defined as the time of the last subject’s Follow -up Phone Call.  
Number of subjects  
Six subjects will participate in  each part of the study. Each subject will participate in either 
Part 1 or Part 2, but not both.

Refer to the Investigat or’s Brochure (IB)  for detailed information concerning the available 
pharmacology, toxicology, drug metabolism, clinical studies, and adverse event (AE) profile 
of the investigational  medicinal product (IM P).1 
1.1. Background 
LOXO-305 (also known as LY3527727) is a selective inhibitor of the Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK) being developed by Loxo Oncology. LOXO- 305 is distinct from the approved 
BTK inhibitors (ibrutinib, acalabrutinib, and zanubrutinib) in several important ways  
including on the basis of its selectivity, favorable ADME properties, and non-covalent binding mode.
2 These features enable LOXO -305 to achieve pharmacokinetic (PK) exposures 
that exceed the BTK  concentration required for 90% inhibition  (IC90) at trough and thus 
deliver tonic BTK target inhibition throughout the dosing period, regardless of the intrinsic rate of BTK turnover. Moreover, the non-covalent binding mode of LOXO-305 is unaffected by BTK C481 substitutions, a common mechanism of drug resistance described for all available covalent inhibitors.
3,4,5,6,7 Finally, LOXO-305 is also a highly selective molecule, 
with more than 300-fold more selective for BTK versus 370 other kinases tested and no significant inhibition of non- kinase off -targets at 1 μM, thus lim iting the potential for off -
target mediated toxicities. Collectively, these unique properties of LOXO -305 are expected to 
deliver more potent, continuous, and selective inhibition of BTK in a variety of settings, potentially resulting in increased efficacy . Of note, the activity of LOXO-305 in diverse 
preclinical model systems supports this underlying hypothesis.
2 
LOXO-305 is a small molecule that was designed to block the adenosine triphosphate binding site of the BTK kinase competitively, with no evidence of irreversible binding.  
1.2. Non-clinical Pharmacokinetics  
LOXO- 305 ha d high permeability in vitro, but low aqueous solubility. To reduce the 
variability in oral absorption, a spray -dried dispersion (SDD) tablet formulation was 
developed that show ed consistent oral bioavailability of approximately  50% in rats and 80% 
in dogs. The bioavailability of the SDD formulation was also not dependent on feeding state 
in dogs. 
As is common in rodents, oral exposure of LOXO-305 was consistently much higher in 
female rats than in males given the same dose of LO XO-305. The sex difference was also 
apparent after intravenous (IV) administration of LOXO -305. There was no difference in the 
PK of LOXO-305 between sexes of dog, and none is expected in other non- rodent species, 
including humans.  
The volume of distribut ion (V
z) of LOXO-305 ranged from approximately 2 L/kg in the dog 
to 5 L/kg in the male rat, which indicates that LOXO -305 distributes into tissues. LOXO-305 
had protein binding of approximately 95% in human plasma. A somewhat lower extent of 
binding (approximately 82% to 92%) was observed across mouse, rat, rabbit, and dog. 
LOXO-305 was metabolized slowly by human microsomal fractions and hepatocytes. The 
low rates of metabolism in both these human in vitro systems suggest that LOXO -305 will 
have low clearance in humans. In vitro data with cloned expressed cytochrome P450 (CYP)  
Protocol CONFIDENTIAL  
Covance Study: 8419667 Protocol Reference: LOXO -BTK-20007 
Protocol Version 1.0, 29 June 2020 Page 20 of 69  enzymes and human liver microsomes indicate that CYP3A4 is the primary CYP enzyme that 
metabolizes LOXO -305. It is also a substrate for direct glucuronidation. 
In long- term hepatocyte incubations, LOXO -305 was metabolized by both oxidation and 
glucuronidation. Inhibition of oxidative metabolism by addition of the P450 inhibitor 1-aminobenzotriazole showed that oxidative metabolism is CYP dependent. All metabolites formed by human hepatocytes were also formed in rat and/or dog hepatocytes supporting the use of rat and dog for nonclinical safety assessment.  
Renal clearance of LOXO -305 in male and female rats was negligible. No data on renal 
clearance are available in other species; however, the renal excretion pathway is often conserved across species, and therefore no renal clearance would be expected in humans.  
In a Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) in vitro assay for human ether -à-go-go- related  gene 
(hERG) activity, the concentration resul ting in 50% inhibition  for the inhibitory effects of 
LOXO- 305 on hERG potassium currents was 32 μM, which is  approximately 50- fold higher 
than the maximum unbound concentration of LOXO-305 in patients treated with the dose of 200 mg once daily ( QD). There were no LOXO-305- related changes in any cardiovascular 
endpoints including QTc at single doses up to 60 mg/kg in the GLP  cardiovascular study in 
the conscious dog. The C
max for this dose was 10000 ng/mL, which is approximately 1.6 -fold 
above the predicted C max plasma LOXO -305 concentration ( 6430 ng/mL) at the proposed 
clinical starting dose of 2 00 mg QD. Furthermore, there were no LOXO-305- related 
abnormalities in rhythm or waveform morphology in the GLP 28- day repeated -dose toxicity 
study in dogs at the low and mid -dose groups based on comparison of predose and postdose 
ECG recordings. The high dose (90/60 mg/kg/dose twice daily [BID]) was not evaluated as animals in this group were moribund/debilitated and were terminated on Day 13. Mean QTc interval was statistically significantly prolonged (+6%; +15 msec) on Day 26 of the dosing 
phase in males administered 30/10 mg/kg/dose BID compared with controls. The prolongation in QTc was below the 10% increase or the threshold reported for canines 
exposed to therapeutic concentrations of drugs known to cause QT prolongation in humans.
8 
Therefore, the QTc changes were considered physiologically unimportant, and thus not deemed to be adverse.  Together, these data indicate that LOXO-305 has a low risk of 
inducing delayed ventricular repolarization, prolongation of the QTc interval, and unstable arrhythmias in pat ients.  
There were no LOXO -305-related findings on the central nervous system when evaluated in 
rat functional observational battery tests and locomotor activity assessments  after 4 weeks of 
dosing or during recovery at doses of up to 500 mg/kg/dose BID in male rats and 175 mg/kg/dose BID in female rats as part of the GLP 28 -day repeat- dose study.  
LOXO-305 had no effect on respiration rate in the dog at doses up to 30/10 mg/kg/dose BID.  
1.3. Summary of Clinical Experience  
LOXO- 305 is currently being studied in an ongoing global Phase 1/2 first- in-human study, 
LOXO- BTK -18001 (the BRUIN Study) , in patients with previously treated chronic 
lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL )/ small lymphocytic lymphoma ( SLL) or non -Hodgkin 
lymphoma ( NHL ). The starting dose of LOXO-305 was 25 mg  QD.  
Protocol CONFIDENTIAL  
Covance Study: 8419667 Protocol Reference: LOXO -BTK-20007 
Protocol Version 1.0, 29 June 2020 Page 21 of 69  As of 09 April 2020, safety data were available from 172 treated patients, with 300 mg  QD as 
the highest dose administered ( Section  1.3.1). As of 30 March 2020 (data cutoff date) , PK 
data were available from 107 patients ( Section  1.3.2).  
1.3.1. Safety  
As of 09 April 2020, 172 patients were treated in the first- in-human study 
(LOXO- BTK-18001) and received LOXO -305 at doses ranging from 25 mg QD to 300 mg 
QD. A full summary of treatment -emergent adverse events ( TEAEs ) for patients in this study 
is provided in the LOXO-305 IB and the Investigator is directed to the safety information 
described in  that document.1  
Overall, TEAEs were reported in 123 of 172 treated patients in the safety population and were mild or moderate severity (Grade 1 or 2) in 89 of 123 ( 51.7%) p atients and were 
Grade  3 or 4 in severity in 33 of 123 (19.2%) patients. The most frequently reported TEAEs 
occurring in ≥10% of patients were fatigue (12.8% total, 7.0% related) and diarrhea (10.5% total, 6.4% related). The most frequently reported drug-r elated TEAEs (those in > 5% of 
patients) were fatigue (7.0%), diarrhea (6.4%), and contusion (5.2%). All other drug- related 
TEAEs occurred in < 5% of patients each. The most frequently reported Grade ≥  3 TEAEs 
included neutropenia (4.1% total; 2.9% related ), neutrophil count decreased (2.3% total; 1.2% 
related), anemia (1.7% total; 0.6% related), fatigue  and platelet count decreased (each 1.2% 
total; each 0.6% related), and hypokalemia (1.2% total; none related).  
Five patients (2.9% of all 172 patients treated) discontinued LOXO- 305 because of TEAEs; 
2 of the 5 patients (1.2% of all patients treated) discontinued LOXO -305 because of a 
treatment- related event. One of these patients with mantle cell lymphoma  treated in the 
100 mg QD group discontinued due to Grade 3 leukocytosis considered related to study drug. 
Study therapy was held for resolution of leukocytosis and the patient subsequently progressed and study therapy was not resumed; the event of leukocytosis was recorded as recovered/resolved. The second patient treated in the 150 mg QD group discontinued due to Grade 2 myalgia; the myalgia was ongoing. The patient had previously received ibrutinib which was discontinued after 3 months of treatment for AEs.  
A total of 5 deaths have been reported for patients treated in this study, LOXO- BTK-18001. 
No deaths were considered related to LOXO -305. 
1.3.2. Pharmacokinetics  
As of 30 March 2020, PK data were available from 107 patients enrolled in LOXO- BTK -18001. Steady- state PK parameters of LOXO -305 in these cancer patients could 
be derived from data collected on Cycle 1 Day 8 and are shown in Table  1. These data show 
that LOXO-305 is absorbed after oral administration with a median
 time of maximal plasma 
concentration  (Tmax) of approximately 2 hours and low clearance ( Table  1). Due to the limited 
sampling interval (0 -8 hours), imputation for the 24- hour sample was made from the Cycle 1 , 
Day 8 predose sample, leading to an estimated plasma half -life of approximately 20 hours. 
Following administration of doses of 100 mg QD higher, mean trough plasma levels of LOXO- 305 exceeded the concentration required for 90% inhibition (IC
90 = 825 ng/mL) of 
BTK in vitro ( Figure 1 ).

The purpose of Part 1  of this study is to determine the absorption, metabolism, and excretion 
(AME) of [14C]-LOXO-305 and to characterize and determine the metabolites present in 
plasma, urine, and, where possible, feces in healthy male subjects following a single oral  
adminis tration. Knowledge of the metabolism and excretion of parent drug and its 
metabolites is useful for evaluating the Metabolites in Safety Testing requirements elucidated 
in the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Guidance9 and International Conference on 
Harmonisation M310 and the likelihood of effects of renal or hepatic impairment on the 
disposition of LOXO-305 and the likelihood for drug- drug interactions with LOXO -305. The 
results from this study may guide future study designs using special populations or evaluating the potential for drug -drug interactions. 
The purpose of Part 2 of this study is to determine the absolute bioavailability of LOXO-305 in a tablet formulation  in humans using an IV microtracer of [
14C]-LOXO-305 (containing 
~1 µCi  radioactivity). Absolute bioavailability information will aid in the planning and 
design of future studies and may be used to interpret PK  data from these studies.  
1.5. Risk Assessmen t 
Subjects in the current study will not receive any health benefit (beyond that of an assessment of their medical status) from participating in the study. The risks of participation are primarily those associated with adverse reactions to the study treatments, although there may also be some discomfort from collection of blood samples and other study procedures. The dose of LOXO-305 administered in this study is not anticipated to induce any potential risk to subjects participating in this study as it is a  single dose which does not exceed the highest 
dose safely administered in first -in-human studies.
1 More information about the known and 
expected benefits, risks, and reasonably anticipated AEs associated with LOXO -305 may be 
found in the IB.1 
For Part 1, the  planned radioactive dose of 200 mg of [14C]-LOXO-305 
(containing ~200 µCi) is exp ected to provide a sufficient radioactive signal to achieve the 
study objectives with minimal radiation risk to subjects.  Based on the dosimetry analysis in 
pigmented rats, the overall whole-body radiation dose in a male subject after administration of a s ingle 100 -µCi (3.7-MBq) oral dose of [
14C]-LOXO-305 was calculated to be 120 mrem 
(1.2 mSv) when using a llometric conversion.11 This value is well below the FDA exposure 
limit of 3000 mrem after a single dose for human isotope studies.12 Based on the PK and 
available dosimetry data, administration of a single 200 -µCi (7.4-MBq) oral dose of 
[14C]-LOXO-305 would not be expected to represent a significant radiation exposure risk 
when administered to healthy male subjects in a clinical trial.  
For Part 2, the radioactive dose of ~1 µCi of [14C]-LOXO-305 (microtracer) is only about 
0.5% of the radioactive dose planned for Part 1 and will present minimal radiation risk to healthy subjects. The low levels of radioactivity planned for Part 2 will n ecessitate the use of  
AMS  as a highly sensitive analytical technique for quantifying the radioactivity in plasma, 
urine, and fecal samples. The radioactive dose of ~1 µCi together with the use of AMS for analysis of radioactivity is expected to allow for completion of study objectives of Part 2 with minimal radiation exposure risk to healthy subject s.

Protocol Version 1.0, 29 June 2020 Page 25 of 69  The potential risk of participating in this study is well managed by the study set-up and is 
considered negligible. The safety monitoring practices employed w ill include AE reporting, 
vital sign  measurements , 12-lead ECG, clinical laboratory evaluations, and physical 
examinations, and are considered adequate to protect the subjects’ safety.

3. INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
3.1. Overall Study Design and Plan 
This will be a n open- label, nonrandomized, 2-part, A ME and absolute bioavailability study of 
[14C]-LOXO-305 in healthy ma le subjects. Subjects in Part 1 will not participate in Part 2, 
nor will subjects in Part 2 participate in Part 1. Parts 1 and 2 are independent of each other 
and do not need to be conducted in sequential order. 
Part 1 is designed to evaluate the AME profiles  of LOXO-305, to identify and characterize 
metabolites of LOXO -305, and to assess the safety and tolerability of [14C]-LOXO-305. 
Subjects in Part 1 will be administered a single oral dose of 20 0 mg  of [14C]-LOXO-305 
(containing ~ 200 µCi)  as an oral solution. Six  subjects will participate  in each part of the 
study. Each subject will participate in either Part  1 or Part 2, but not both. In the event of 
early wi thdrawal of any subjects and/or to ensure 6 subjects complete each part of the study, 
replacement subjects may be enrolled at the discretion of the Sponsor. Part 2 is designed to determine the absolute bioavailability of LOXO -305, to evaluate the 
plasma co ncentration of total radioactivity , to evaluate t he urinary excretion of 
[
14C]-LOXO-305 and total radioactivity, to evaluate the fecal excretion of [14C]-LOXO-305 
and total radioactivity , and to assess the safety and tolerability of LOXO-305 and 
[14C]-LOXO-305. Subjects in Part 2 will be adminis tered a single oral dose of 200 mg  of 
LOXO-305 as 2 × 100-mg tablets followed 2 hours later by a single dose of < 100 µg of 
[14C]-LOXO-305 (containing ~1  µCi of radioactivity [microtracer) administered as an IV 
push over approximately 2 minutes.  Six subjects will participate  in each part of the study. Each subject will participate in either 
Part 1 or Part 2, but not both. 
In the event of early with drawal of any subjects and/or to ensure 6 subjects complete each 
part of the study, replacement subjects may be enrolled at the discretion of the Sponsor. The start of the study is defined as the earliest date a subject who is enrolled in either part of 
the study signs an Informed Consent Form (ICF). A subject who completes sufficient total radioactivity and metabolite (Part 1 only), or LOXO -305 and [
14C]-LOXO-305 (Part 2 only) 
sampling prior to Clinic Discharge is considered to have completed the study. The end of the study is defined as the latest date a subject receives the Follow -up Call. The planned duration 
of study conduct for Part 1 is up to 60  days from Screening through the Follow -up Call. The 
planned duration of study conduct for Part 2 is up to 47 days from Screening through the Follow-up Call.

3.2. Discussion of Study Design  
Part 1 of this study is designed to evaluate the AME kinetics of LOXO-305 using 
radiolabeled drug in healthy adult male subjects to support its further development and registration. Part 1 will also allow for identification and characterizatio n of any metabolites of 
LOXO-305 that are produced following oral dosing. Analysis of total radioactivity  and 
metabolites  in urine and feces will provide information about the exten t of urine and fecal 
excretion of LOXO -305 and its  metabolites . 
Part 2 is designed to determine the absolute bioavailability of LOXO -305 by comparing its 
plasma exposure following oral dosing to the plasma exposure of [
14C]-LOXO-305 following 
IV microtracer administration. The IV microtracer method allows for simultaneous oral and IV dosing in the same subjects, which is expected to result in less variability in absolute bioavailability estimate s. The IV dose of [
14C]-LOXO-305 will be administered so that peak 
plasma concentrations of [14C]-LOXO-305 occur approximately at the t max of LOXO-305 
following oral dosing. Analysis of urine and fecal  concentrations of [14C]-LOXO- 305 and 
total radioactivity will allow for determination of the amount and percentage of LOXO-305 excreted unchanged in urine and feces. 
In Part 2, a microtracer (~1 µCi  of radioactivity ) of [
14C]-LOXO-305 will be used. This low 
level of radioactivity necessitates the use of accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS ) as a more 
sensitive analytical method for detecting the low levels o f radioactivity in plasma, urine, and 
fecal samples.  
The study will be open- l abel because the study measures are objective outcomes (eg, PK 
parameters, total radioactivity in select biological matrices, metabolite 
profiling/characterization). Female subjects will be excluded to align with regulatory guidance. The “as low as (is) reasonably achievable” (ALARA) principle prescribed by the FDA
12 recommends that radiation exposure to subjects should be kept ALARA; therefore, if 
no specific reason exists to include females (ie, no available data suggest metabolism of LOXO- 305 is different in females versus males), then the radiation exposure to fema le 
subjects should ideally be kept at zero by not including females in this radioactivity study and only enrolling and dosing male subjects. Conducting the study in healthy subjects will allow the evaluation of LOXO -305 metabolism and bioavailability in th e absence of concomitant 
medications and comorbidities. The dose, subject population, study duration, and sample collection timing are considered adequate to achieve the study objectives. 
3.3. Selection of Doses in the Study  
Single oral doses of 200 mg LOXO-305 will be evaluated as this  has been chosen as the 
recommended Phase 2 dose for the ongoing global Phase 1/2 first- in-human study, 
LOXO- BTK -18001 (BRUIN Study) . Doses of LOXO-305 from 25 mg QD to 300 mg QD 
Protocol CONFIDENTIAL  
Covance Study: 8419667 Protocol Reference: LOXO -BTK-20007 
Protocol Version 1.0, 29 June 2020 Page 32 of 69  have been evaluated in the  ongoing global Phase 1/2 first -in-human study, 
LOXO- BTK -18001 (BRUIN Study)  in patients with previously treated CLL/SLL or NHL 
w
ith dose escalation  up to 300 mg QD approved by the study’s Safety Review Committee. 
The available data demonstrate that LOXO -305 appears safe and well tolerated at these 
doses. At all evaluated doses, including oral doses of up to 300  mg QD, no dose- limiting 
toxicities have been identified in humans.1 A <1 00 µg dose has been chosen as the IV  
microdose to permit dosing without supporting IV toxicology data.10  
For Part 1 , the planned radioactive dose of 200 mg of [14C]-LOXO-305 
(containing ~200 µCi) is expected to provide a sufficient radioactive signal to achieve the 
study objectives with minimal radiation risk to subjects. Based on the dosimetry analysis in pigmented  rats, the overall whole-body radiation dose in a male subject after administration 
of a single 100 -µCi ( 3.7-MBq) oral dose of [
14C]-LOXO- 305 was calculated to be 120 mrem 
(1.2 mSv)  when using a llometric conversion .11 This value is well belo w the FDA exposure 
limit of 3000  mrem after a single dose for human isotope studies.12 Based on the PK and 
available dosimetry data, administration of a single 200- µCi ( 7.4-MBq) oral dose of 
[14C]-LOXO-305 would not be expected to represent a significant radiation exposure risk 
when administered to healthy male subjects in a clinical trial.  
For Part 2 , the radioactive dose of ~1 µCi of [14C]-LOXO-305 (microtracer) is only about 
0.5% of the radioactive dose planned for Part 1  and will present minimal radiation risk to 
healthy subjects. The low levels of radioactivity planned for Part 2  will necessitate the use of  
AMS  as a highly sensitive analytical technique for quant ifying the radioactivity in plasma , 
urine, and fecal  samples. The radioactive dose of ~1 µCi together with the use of AMS for 
analysis of radioactivity is expected to allow for completion of study objectives of Part 2  with 
minimal radiation exposure risk to healthy subjects.

Protocol Version 1.0, 29 June 2020 Page 39 of 69  insufficient PK data may be replaced. Replacement subjects will be assigned a subject 
number by adding 200 to the last 3 digits of the subject number for the subject they are 
replacing (eg, Subject Number 001-301 replaces Subject Number 001-101). 
4.6. Removal of Subjects from Study Participation  
Subjects will be informed that they are free to withdraw from the study at any time and for 
any reason. The Investigator (or designee) may remove a subject from the study if, in the 
Investigator’s (or designee’s) opinion, it is not in the best interest of the subject to continue 
the study. Subjects may be withdrawn because of the following:  
• change in compliance with inclusion/exclusion criterion that is clinically relevant and 
affects subject safety  
• occurrence of AEs 
• intake of non- permitted concomitant medication that might affect subject safety or 
study assessments/objectives, etc.  
Notification of withdrawal will immediately be made to the Sponsor . In case of withdrawal, 
efforts will be made to perform all final study day assessments (Appendix 4). The date the 
subject is withdrawn from the study and the reason for withdrawal will be recorded on the subject’s electronic Case Report Form (eCRF). All withdrawn subjects with AEs that are assessed as related to study drug and which are ongoing at ET may continue to be followed until the symptoms or value(s) return to normal, or acceptable levels, as judged by the Investigator (or designee) and confirmed by the Sponsor. 
The entire study may be discontinued at the discretion of the Investigator (or designee) or 
Sponsor, based on the occurrence of the following: 
• adverse events unknown to date with respect to their nature, severity, and/or duration 
• increased frequency and/or severity and/or duration of known AEs 
• medical or ethical reasons affecting the continued performance of the study  
• difficulties in the recruitment of subjects  
• cancellation of drug development. 
In the event that the study is termin ated early, the Sponsor or its designee will provide 
specific guidance to the CRU regarding the EOS procedures.

The Sponsor will supply a sufficient quantity of the applicable IMP and  API for the 
manufacture of the respective unit doses at C ovance CRU. All excipients will be sourced by 
Covance. Specific instructions regarding dose preparation will be mutually agreed upon 
between the Sponsor and the appropriate clinical staff and will be presented in a separate document. 
The API and IMP will b e stored according to the instructions on the label at the CRU in a 
location that is locked with restricted access.   
5.2. Study Treatment Administration  
In Part 1 , subjects will receive a single oral dose of  200 mg of [
14C]-LOXO-305 
(containing ~200 µCi)  as an oral solution with 24 0 mL  of room temperature water. In Part 2 , 
subjects will receive a single oral dose of 200 mg LOXO-305 as 2 × 100- mg tablets  with 
240 mL  of room temperature water followed 2 hours later by a single dose of < 100 µg  
[14C]-LOXO-305 (containing ~1  µCi radioactivity [microtracer]) as  an IV push over 
approximately 2 minutes . In both parts, an additional 100 mL of water may be administered if 
needed. In Parts 1 and 2, oral dosing will be preceded by an overnight fast (ie, at least 10 hours ) from 
food (not including water) and will be followed by a fast from food (not including water) for 
at least 4  hours post- oral dose. During Part 2 , subjects may receive lunch  approximately 
2 hours after receiving the IV dose. Except as part of dose administration, subjects will restrict their consumption of water for 1 hour prior to oral dose and for 1 hour post-oral dose. At all other times during the study, subjects may consume water ad libitum.  
Protocol CONFIDENTIAL  
Covance Study: 8419667 Protocol Reference: LOXO -BTK-20007 
Protocol Version 1.0, 29 June 2020 Page 41 of 69  Each unit dose will be prepared by qualified CRU staff. Each unit dose container will be 
appropriately labeled. 
Appropriate unit dose(s), as described above, will be administered to subjects. Although the 
timing of events requires that each subject will be consistently administered the appropriate dose at a specific time, the exact dose time of subjects may be staggered to obviate the need to have all subjects on precisely the same study schedule. For each dose, the subject’s actual dose time will be recorded in the source documents and transcribed into the eCRF.  
Subjects will be instructed not to crush, split, or chew oral LOXO-305 tablets. 
All oral doses will be administered while the subjects are seated and subjects will not be 
permitted to lie supine for 4 hours’ post- oral dose except as necessitated by the occurrence of 
an AE(s) and/or study procedures. Subjects may be asked to be semi- supine/supine for the IV 
dosing. 
Except when they are using the toilet, study subjects will be observed for approximately 
4 hours post-oral dose to ensure that they are not experiencing AEs, becoming nauseated, or experiencing emesis.  
5.3. Randomization 
This is a nonrandomized study. 
5.4. Blinding  
This is an open -label study. 
5.5. Treatment Compliance  
The following measures will be employed to ensure treatment compliance:  
• All doses will be administered under the supervision of suitably qualified CRU staff . 
• Immediately after oral administration, visual inspection of the mouth will be 
performed for each subject.  
• At each dosing occasion, a predose and postdose inventory of IMP will be performed.  
5.6. Drug Accountability  
The Investigator (or designee) will maintain an accurate record of the receipt of the study 
supplies (including all IMP and API) received. In addition, an accurate drug disposition 
record will be kept, specifying the amount dispensed to each subject and the date of 
dispensing. This drug accountability record will be available for inspection at any time. At the completion of the study, the original drug accountability record will be available for review by the Sponsor upon request. 
For oral unit doses containing 
14C, the empty used unit dose containers will undergo 
radioanalysis to determine the amount of any residual radioactivity remaining after dose 
admin istration and be discarded upon satisfactory completion of the compliance and

of the study. 
At the completion of the study, all unused supplies (including all IMP and API)  will be 
disposed of by the CRU, per the Sponsor’s written instructions and/or in accordance with 
local/state/federal guidelines governing waste disposal of investigational drugs and the CRUs Standard Operating Procedures. 
6. CONCOMITANT THERAPIES AND OTHER RESTRICTIONS  
6.1. Concomitant Therapies 
Paracetamol/acetaminophen ( maximum 2 g/day for up to 3 consecutive days) is an acceptable 
concomitant medication. Subjects will refrain from participation in any other investigational study drug trial in which 
receipt of any investigational drug occurs within 5 half-lives (if known) or 30 days, whichever is longer, prior to first dose administration (Day  1). 
All prescription /nonprescription and over -the-counter medications (including  herbal products, 
natural or herbal supplements, except for paracetamol/acetaminophen as referenced above) are prohibited for 14 days prior to dose administration (Day  1) and through EOT or ET, 
unless deemed acceptable by the Investigator (or designee) and  Sponsor. This includes but is 
not limited to: moderate or strong CYP3A4 and/or CYP3A5 inhibitors or inducers (including herbal products such as St, John’s wort), strong P-gp inhibitors, proton pump inhibitors, antacids, H
2-receptor antagonists, and drugs that prolong QT/QTc interval. 
Any medication taken by a subject during the course of the study, including details of its dosage, administration, and the reason for its use, will be documented in the eCRF. 
The administration of any concomitant medication during the study is prohibited without 
prior approval of the Investigator (or designee) and Sponsor, unless its use is deemed necessary in a medical emergency. In this case, the use of the concomitant medication will be reported as soon as is practical.  
6.2. Diet, Fluid, and Activity Control 
While confined at the CRU, subjects will receive a standardized high fiber diet at scheduled times that do not conflict with other study -related activities. Pitted prunes or prune juice may 
be given on an as-needed basis to aid in normal bowel function and will not be considered a concomitant medication.  
Subjects are required to refrain from use of tobacco, smoking cessation products, and 
nicotine- containing products within 3  months prior to Screening through EOT or ET  . 
Consumption of foods or beverages containing grapefruit/grapefruit juice or Seville oranges or its juice within 7 days  prior to Check- in (Day -1) and through EOT or ET will not be

Protocol Version 1.0, 29 June 2020 Page 44 of 69  7.1.3. Vomitus  Sample Collection  
In Part 1, for subje cts experiencing emesi s within 4 hours following oral dosing, vomitus will 
be collected. Attempts will be made to collect vomitus from subjects experiencing emesis 
after 4 hours postdose. All vomitus collected will be stored for possible analysis as deemed appropriate. 
7.1.4. Analytic al Methodology 
In Parts 1 and 2, plasma concentrations of LOXO -305 will be determined using a validated 
bioanalytical method.  In Part 1, total radioactivity in p lasma,  whole blood, urine, and feces will be determined with 
liquid scintillation counting (LSC) . Profiling and identification of metabolites in plasma, 
urine, and, where possible, feces will be conducted using standard laboratory procedures.  In Part 2 , concentrations of [
14C]-LOXO-305 in plasma, urine, and feces will be determined 
using high performance liquid chromatography fractionation followed by AMS. 
Concentrations of total radioactivity in plasma, urine and feces will be determined using 
AMS and/or LSC . Specifics of the analytical methods will be provided in separate 
documents. 
7.2. Safety and Tolerability Assessments  
Safety evaluations may be repeated at the discretion of the Investigator (or designee) or 
Sponsor. 
Every effort will be made to schedule and perform the procedures in accordance with the 
nominal time, giving consideration s to appropriate posture conditions, practical restrictions, 
and any other procedures to be performed at the same timepoint. The order of priority for scheduling procedures around a timepoint is (in descending order of priority): 
• dosing 
• PK, total radioactivity, and metabolite profiling and identification blood sampling  
• start and end of urine and fecal collections (for drug assay)  
• vital sign measurements  
• 12-lead ECGs 
• blood and urine samples for clinical laboratory evaluations 
• physical examination. 
7.2.1. Adverse Events  
Adverse event definitions; assignment of severity, causality, action taken, and outcome; and procedures for reporting SAEs are detailed in Appendix 1. 
Subjects will be asked a non -leading HDYF? question such as “Have there been any changes 
in your health status since Screening/since you were last asked?” at the timepoints specified 
Protocol CONFIDENTIAL  
Covance Study: 8419667 Protocol Reference: LOXO -BTK-20007 
Protocol Version 1.0, 29 June 2020 Page 45 of 69  in Appendix 4 (ie, at Screening [after the ICF is signed], at Check -in [Day  -1], at each 
postdose vital sign measurement s, and at an appropriate time for all other days). Subjects will 
also be encouraged to voluntarily report AEs occurring at any other time through the EOS. 
Adverse events, whether volunteered, identified by the subject’s responses to HDYF? 
inquiries, or noted on physical examination, ECG, vital sign measurement s, or clinical 
laboratory evaluations, will be recorded throughout the study (ie, from signing of the ICF until EOS [or ET if the subject discontinues from the study and does not complete a Follow-up Phone C all]), either as subject medical history (if the event is reported as 
beginning prior to signing of the ICF or if the event occurs prior to study drug administration on Day 1 and is assessed as not related to study procedures by the Investigator [or designee]) or as AEs (if the event occurs after signing of the ICF but prior to study drug administration on Day 1 and is assessed as related to study procedures by the Investigator [or designee], or if the event occurs after study drug administration on Day 1 through EOT or ET regardless of relationship to study drug). From EOT or ET through EOS, only AEs assessed as related to study drug by the Investigator (or designee) are to be reported. All SAEs that develop from 
the time of ICF signing until EOS (or ET, if the subject discontinues from the study and does 
not complete a Follow- up Phone C all) are to be reported.  
Unless a subject withdraws consent or is withdrawn from the study and does not complete the Follow-up Phone C all, all subjects must be followed until EOS. Subjects with AEs that are 
assessed as related to study drug by the Investi gator (or designee) which are ongoing at EOS 
may continue to be followed until the symptoms or value(s) return to normal, or acceptable levels, as judged by the Investigator (or designee) and confirmed by the Sponsor. The Investigator (or designee) should use appropriate judgment in ordering additional tests as necessary to monitor the resolution of events. The Sponsor may request that additional safety tests be performed.  
Subjects will receive a Follow-up Phone C all 7 days (± 2 days) after EOT or ET to determine 
if any SAE or drug- related AE has occurred since the EOT or ET visit.  
At all times, a subject may be required to remain at the CRU for longer at the discretion of the Investigator (or designee).  
Any event that meets the criteria of a suspected unexp ected serious adverse reaction 
(SUSAR) will be reported to the Institutional Review Board (IRB) according to CRU policy by the Investigator (or designee) and to regulatory authorities by the Sponsor (or Sponsor designee) according to regulatory authority r equirements. Refer to Reference Safety 
Information  (RSI) in the current IB
1 for LOXO-305 for additional safety information. 
7.2.2. Clinical Laboratory Evaluations 
Clinical laboratory evaluations (clinical chemistry panel [fasted at least 8  hours;  at EOT and 
ET subjects are not required to be fasted prior to clinical laboratory evaluations ], coagulation 
parameters, hematology panel , TSH [Screening only],  HbA1c [Screening only],  glomerular 
filtration rate  [Screening and Check- in (Day -1)] and UA) will be collected at the timepoints 
specified in  Appendix 4.  
Screens for HCV antibody, HBV core antibody, HBsAg, and HIV antibody will be performed 
at Screening.

Protocol Version 1.0, 29 June 2020 Page 46 of 69  Testing  for COVID-19 via PCR (or equivalent) will be performed at the timepoints specified 
in Appendix 4. Testing  for COVID-19 may  also be conducted  periodically during the 
subject’s CRU confinement, at the discretion of the Investigator (or designee). Further details 
regarding COVID -19 testing (including procedures who test positive at any time throughout 
CRU confinement) are specified in a separate document.  
A urine drug screen for selected drugs of abuse (including cotinine and alcohol ) will be 
performed at Screening and repeated at Check -in (Day  -1) for all subjects.  
The number of blood samples and total blood volume required for clinical laboratory evaluations is presented in Appendix 3. A l ist of the specific evaluations is in Appendix 2. 
7.2.3. Vital Signs  
Vital sign  measurement s (including oxygen saturation, oral temperature, respiratory rate, and 
supine BP and pulse rate) will be obtained at the timepoints specified in Appendix 4.  
Blood pressure and pulse rate measurements should be performed using the same arm for each reading and measurements should be taken after the subject has been resting in the supine position for at least 5 minutes.  
When vital sign measurement s are scheduled at the same time as blood draws, the blood 
draws will be obtained at the scheduled timepoint, and the vital sign measurements will be 
obtained prior to and as close as possible to the scheduled blood draw. 
7.2.4. 12-L ead E lectrocardiogram  
A 12 -lead ECG (including HR, PR, RR, QRS, and QT interval parameters) will be obtained 
after the subject has been resting for at least 10  minutes in the supine position at the 
timepoints specified in  Appendix 4. The QT interval will be corrected for heart rate by 
Fridericia’s (QTcF  = QT/[RR]
1/3) formula.  
When 12- lead ECGs are scheduled at the same time as blood draws, the blood draws will be 
obtained at the scheduled timepoint, and the 12-lead ECGs will be obtained prior to and as 
close as possible to the scheduled blood draw. 
7.2.5. Physical Examination 
A complete or abbreviated physical examination will be performed at the timepoints specified 
in Appendix 4. Complete physical examinations will evaluate general appearance and the 
following body systems/organs: dermatological; head and eyes; ears, nose, mouth, and throat; pulmonary; cardiovascular; abdominal; lymphatic; musculoskeletal/extremities; and neurological. Weight and height will be reported (height only reported during Screening). 
Abbreviated physical examinations will evaluate general appearance and the f ollowing body 
systems/organs: dermatological; pulmonary; cardiovascular; abdominal; and neurological.

8.1. Determination of Sample Size  
No formal statistical assessment of sample size has been conducted  as this study does not 
have a hypothesis. The sample size chosen for this study is common in human radiolabeled 
studies and is considered sufficient to achieve the objectives of the study. Six subjects will 
participate  in each part  of the study. Each subject will participate in either Part 1 or Part 2. In 
the event of early withdrawal of any subjects and/or to ensure 6 subjects complete each part of the study, replacement subjects may be enrolled at the discretion of the Sponsor.  
8.2. Analysis Populations  
8.2.1. Pharmacokinetic Population  
The P K population  will include all subjects who received at least 1  dose of LOXO -305 or 
[
14C]-LOXO-305 and have evaluable PK data. At the discretion of the Sponsor, a subject may 
be excluded from the PK summary statistics and statistical analysis.  The impact of protocol 
deviations on PK population will be evaluated on a case-by- case basis.  
8.2.2. Safety Population 
The safety population  will include all subjects who received at least 1  dose of LOXO -305. 
Subjects will be classified into groups based on actual treatment received.

and by relationship to study drug as determined by the Investigator or designee ( Appendix 1 
for AE reporting). All TEAEs will be summarized by SOC and PT. 
8.5. Data Handling and Record Keeping  
Any changes to information in the trial progress notes and other source documents will be 
initialed and dated on the day the change is made by a CRU staff member authorized to make 
the change. C hanges will be made by striking a single line through erroneous data and clearly 
entering the correct data (eg, wrong data right data). If the reason for the change is not 
apparent, a brief explanation for the change will be written adjacent to the change by the clinician.  
The Data Management Plan will be approved by the Sponsor. 
Data will be validated during data entry by the CRU and verified by the Study Monitor. Data 
will then be reviewed by the data management group to resolve any outstanding issues. Listings will be generated after the database is cleaned by data management and will be 
reviewed by the Covance scientific team. The eCRF and ancillary data will be converted into final SAS
® datasets following Study Data Tabulation Model or client-provided specifications. 
The final datasets structure will be verified using Web Submission Data Manager®, while the 
dataset content will be peer  reviewed by an independent programmer. 
The tables, figures, and listings (TFLs) will be programmed per the final SAP. All TFLs will be peer reviewed by an independent programmer. In addition, draft TFLs will be reviewed by the Covance scientific team during the dry run and data review meetings. 
The peer review will be performed by independent programmers following the quality control 
process and programming checklists.  
8.6. Quality Control and Quality Assurance  
Quality control and quality assurance will be performed according to Covance standard operating procedures or per client request, and as applicable, according to the contr act 
between Covance and the Sponsor. 
9. ADMINSTRATIVE ASPECTS

Investigator (or designee) and appropriate CRU staff to familiarize the Investigator (or designee) and CRU staff with the materials necessary for conducting the clinical study.  
9.3. Disclosure  
All information provided regarding the study, as well as a ll information 
collected/documented during the study, will be regarded as confidential. The Investigator (or designee) agrees not to disclose such information in any way without prior written permission from the Sponsor.  
Any publication of the results, in part or in total (eg, articles in journals or newspapers, oral presentations, abstracts) by the Investigator (or designee) or their representative(s), shall require prior notification and review, within a reasonable timeframe, by the Sponsor, and cannot be made in violation of the Sponsor’s confidentiality restrictions or to the detriment of 
the Sponsor’s intellectual property rights.  
9.4. Monitoring  
The Sponsor will designate a Study Monitor who will be responsible for monitoring this clinical trial. The Sponso r’s Study Monitor will monitor the study conduct, proper eCRF and 
source documentation completion and retention, and accurate study drug accountability. To this end, the Sponsor’s Study Monitor will visit the CRU at suitable intervals and be in frequent co ntact through verbal and written communication. It is essential that the Sponsor’s 
Study Monitor has access to all documents (related to the study and the individual participants) at any time these are requested. In turn, the Sponsor’s Study Monitor will adhere to all requirements for subject confidentiality as outlined in the ICF. The Investigator (or designee) and Investigator’s staff will be expected to cooperate with the Sponsor’s Study Monitor, to be available during a portion of the monitoring visit t o answer questions, and to 
provide any missing information.  
9.5. Institutional Review Board  
In accordance with US Title 21 C FR 56, the protocol, advertisement, ICF, and other 
information provided to subjects will be reviewed and approved by the IRB. The Sponsor 
will supply relevant material for the Investigator (or designee) to submit to the  IRB for the 
protocol’s review and approval. Verification of the IRB unconditional approval of the 
protocol and the written ICF statement will be transmitted to the Investigator (or designee).  
The IRB will be informed by the Investigator (or designee) of subsequent protocol amendments and of serious and unexpected AEs. Approval for protocol amendments will be transmitted in writing to the Investigator (or designee). If requested, the Investigator (or designee) will permit audits by the IRB and regulatory inspections by providing direct access to source data/documents. 
The Investigator (or designee) will provide the IRB with progress reports at appropriate 
intervals (not to exce ed 1 year) and a Study Progress Report following the completion, 
termination, or discontinuation of the Investigator’s (or designee’s) participation in the study.

Protocol Version 1.0, 29 June 2020  Page 57 of 69  Appendix  1: Adverse Event Reporting  
Adverse Events  
Definition of Adverse Events 
An AE  (or adverse experience) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence experienced 
by a patient or healthy adult subject, whether or not considered drug-related by the 
Investigator (or designee). A TEAE is an AE that starts on or after the first administration of study drug. 
The following are all AEs: 
• unfavorable changes in general condition; 
• subjective or objective signs/symptoms;  
• concomitant diseases or accidents;  
• clinically relevant adverse changes in laboratory parameters observed in a subject 
during a clinical study. 
Adverse events comprise all disturbances of general health status, subjective and objective disease symptoms (including laboratory abnormalities that are deemed clinically significant by the Investigator [ or designee ]), and accidents observed in the context of a clinical trial, 
irrespective of a possible causal relationship with the administration of the trial substance.  
Categorization of Adverse Events 
The severity of AEs will be categorized based on the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 5.0 as follows: 
• Grade  1 Mild:  Asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic 
observations only; intervention not indicated 
• Grade  2 Mode rate:  Minimal, local, or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting 
age-appropriate instrumental Activities of Daily Living (ADL)*  
• Grade  3 Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening:  
Hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; limiting self-care ADL**  
• Grade  4 Life -threatening consequences:  An event that puts the subject at 
immediate risk of death  
• Grade  5: Death related to AE.  
Note: Not all grades are appropriate for all AEs. Therefore, some AEs are listed within the CTCAE with fewer than 
5 options for grade selection. Grade 5 (death) is not appropriate for some AEs and therefore is not an option.  
* Instrumental ADL refer to preparing meals, shopping for groceries or clothes, using the telephone, managi ng money, etc.  
**Self-care ADL refer to bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, taking medications, and not 
bedridden. 
Protocol CONFIDENTIAL  
Covance Study: 8419667 Protocol Reference: LOXO -BTK-20007 
Protocol Version 1.0, 29 June 2020  Page 58 of 69  The Investigator (or designee) will make a determination of the relationship of the AE to the 
study drug using a 2 -category system according to the following guidelines: 
• NOT RELATED = The time course between the administration of investigational product and the occurrence or worsening of the AE rules out a causal relationship and another cause (eg, concomitant drugs, therapies, complications, comorbidities) is suspected  
• RELATED = The time course between administration of investigational product and the occurrence or worsening of the AE is consistent with a causal relationship and no other cause (eg, concomitant drugs, therapies, complications, comorbidities) can be identified.  
An AE is associated with the use of the drug if there is a reasonable possibility that the experience may have been caused by the drug. 
Pregnancy 
As information is available, a pregnancy in f emale partners of male subjects diagnosed 
through EOS or ET (if the subject discontinues from the study and does not complete a Follow-up Phone C all)
 and for up to 90 days after study drug administration should be 
reported by the Investigator (or designee) via email to Covance or the Sponsor’s Clinical Safety Representative within 24  hours of first awareness. Covance or the Sponsor’s Clinical 
Safety Rep resentative will then forward the Pregnancy Form to the Investigator (or designee) 
for completion.  
email: SAEIntake@ covance.com 
If possible, t he subject ’s partner should be followed by the Investigator (or designee) until 
completion of the pregnancy. If the pregnancy ends for any reason before the anticipated date, the Investigator (or designee) should notify Covance or the Sponsor’s Clinical Safety 
Representative. At the completion of the pregnancy, the Investigator (or designee) will document the outcome of the pregnancy. 
Subjects will be instructed to notify the Investigator immediately if they discover their sexual 
partner is pregnant. In this instance, the subject’s partner must provide written consent before 
pregnancy information can be collected. When a CRU becomes aware that the female partner 
of a male subject is pregnant, they are to contact the Investigator (or designee) immediately (within 24  hours of the CRU staff becoming aware of the event) in addition to notifying 
Covance or the Sponsor’s Clinical Safety Representative via email.  
All pregnancies should be recorded on the required pregnancy forms.  
Definition of Serious Adverse Events  
An SAE (by FDA definition) is any adverse drug experience occurring at any dose that results in any of the follo wing outcomes: 
• Death;  
Protocol CONFIDENTIAL  
Covance Study: 8419667 Protocol Reference: LOXO -BTK-20007 
Protocol Version 1.0, 29 June 2020  Page 59 of 69  • A life -threatening adverse drug experience (ie, one that places the subject, in the 
view of the Investigator [or designee], at immediate risk of death);  
• Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization;  
• A persistent or significant disability/incapacity;  
• A congenital anomaly/birth defect; 
• An important medical event that may require medical or surgical intervention to 
prevent one of the above outcomes. 
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospitalization may be considered SAEs when, based on appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.  
Unexpected Adverse Drug Reaction  
An AE or suspected adverse drug reaction is considered ‘unexpected’ if the event is not listed in the Reference Safety Information section of the I B or if it is not listed at the specificity or 
severity that has been observed for an unapproved IMP . 
Reporting 
Food and Drug Administration- reportable AEs are AEs that are associated with the use of the 
drug and represent events that are assessed as serious, related, and unexpected. Food and Drug Admini stration -reportable AEs will be reported by the CRU to the Sponsor and the 
responsible I RB. Final determination of whether an event represents a SUSAR will be the 
responsibility of the Sponsor. 
Within 24  hours of when an AE that is potentially FDA- reportab le is first recognized or 
reported, and within 24 hours of any SAE (regardless of whether the event is assessed as 
related or unrelated to study drug) being first recognized or reported, Covance or the 
Sponsor’s Clinical Safety Representative will be notif ied by the Investigator (or designee) in 
writing using the following email address:  
email: SAEIntake@ covance.com 
To report the SAE, the completed report form should be sent by email to Covance or the Sponsor’s Clinical Safety Representative within 24 hours of awareness. Incoming reports are reviewed during normal business hours. Additional reporting instructions and the SAE Report Form are provided in the Study Manual. 
The IRB will be notified of any FDA- reportable AE within the timeframe required by the 
IRB. The IRB Serious and Unexpected Adverse Experience Submission Form will be 
completed and submitted with the copy of the written confirmation or summary of the AE .

Protocol Version 1.0, 29 June 2020  Page 65 of 69  e. 12-lead ECGs will be collected after the subject has rested in the supine position for at least 10 minutes, and will be obtained prior to and as close as possible to the scheduled blood draws at 
Screening and Check -in (Day -1), Day 1 (predose and 2 hours after LOXO -305 dosing), Day s 4, 9, 14 (if a subject is in the CRU), 19 (if the subject is in the CRU) and on the day of Clinic 
Discharge (EOT ) or ET. 
f. Vital sign measurements (supine BP and pulse rate) will be obtained at Screening and Check-in ( Day -1), Day 1 (predose and 2 hours after LOXO -305 dosing),  and daily (24-hour intervals) 
up to and including day of Clinic Discharge  (EOT ) or ET. When scheduled at the same nominal times, postdose vital sign measurements are to be performed prior to postdose PK blood 
draws (see  Section  7.2). Vital sign measurements should be carried out prior to and as close as possible to having blood drawn. Blood pressure and pul se rate will be measured using the same 
arm for each reading after the subject has been supine for at least 5 minutes.  
g. Oral temperature and respiratory rate will also be obtained at Screening, Check-in (Day  -1), and on the day of Clinic Discharge  (EOT ) or ET. 
h. Oxygen saturation will be measured at Screening, Check- in (Day -1), predose on Day 1, and on the day of Clinic Discharge  (EOT ) or ET. 
i. An HDYF? inquiry will be performed at Screening (after the ICF is signed), at Check-in (Day -1), at each postdose vital sign measurement s, and at an appropriate time for a ll other days.  
j. Adverse events and SAEs will be collected beginning at informed consent. Adverse events will be recorded throughout the study (ie, from signing of the ICF until EOS, or until ET if the 
subject discontinues from the study and does not complet e a follow -up phone call), either as subject medical history (if the event is reported as beginning prior to signing of the ICF or if the 
event occurs prior to study drug administration on Day 1 and is assessed as not related to study procedures by the Investigator [or designee]) or as AEs (if the event occurs after signing of the 
ICF but prior to study drug administration on Day 1 and is assessed by the Investigator [or designee]) as related to study procedures, or if the event occurs after study drug administration on 
Day 1 through EOT or ET regardless of relationship to study drug).  From EOT or ET through EOS, only AEs assessed as related to study drug are to be recorded. All SAEs that develop from 
the time of ICF signing until EOS (or ET if the subject discontinues from the study and does not complete a follow -up phone call) are to be reported.  
k. Subjects can be discharged on Day 12 if the following discharge criteria are met: Plasma radioactivity below the limit of quantification for 2 consecutive collecti ons, and ≥ 90% of the

If a subject does not meet the discharge criteria on Day 12, additional blood samples will be collected for LOXO -305 plasma  and total radioactivity plasma and whole blood concentrations at 24-hour intervals until the day of Clinic Discharge ( EOT ) or ET. Sample collection and 
CRU confinement will continue until discharge criteria are met or the maximum stay is reached, unless otherwise agreed upon by the Sponsor and Investigator (or designee). The allowed 
sampling window for blood samples for determination of LOXO-305 concentration (plasma) and total radioactivity (plasma and whole blood) will be the following: within 15 minutes prior 
to dosing for any of the predose sample timepoints; ± 5 minutes for sampling timepoints within the first 12 hours; ± 30 minutes for sampling timepoints > 12 hours < 36 hours; and ± 60 minutes for the sampling timepoints ranging from 48 to 504 hours.

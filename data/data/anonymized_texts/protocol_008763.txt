Protocol Test Abstract: 
This study is designed to compare the accuracy of a noninvasive measuremen t of oxygen  saturation compared to 
reference values obtained by a laboratory blood gas analyzer.  Arterial blood samples will be collected from 
healthy adult subjects while undergoing a desaturation procedur e wherein the concentration of oxygen inhaled is 
slowly reduced until the subject’s arterial oxygen concentratio n is approximately 70%.  The subject will then be 
returned to inhaling room air.

 STATEMENT OF COMPLIANCE 
 This document is a protocol for a clinical research study spons ored by Masimo Corporation.  The study will be 
conducted in compliance with all stipulations of this protocol,  the conditions of IRB approval, 21 CFR Part 50, 21 CFR 
Part 56, 21 CFR Part 812, ISO-14155, and International Conferen ce on Harmonisation E6 Good Clinical Practice (ICH 
GCP). 
The protocol, informed consent form(s), recruitment materials, and all participant materials will be submitted to the 
Institutional Review Board (IRB) for review and approval.  Appr oval of both the protocol and the consent form must 
be obtained before any participant is enrolled.  Any amendment to the protocol will require review and approval by 
the IRB before the changes are implemented to the study.   
1. PURPOSE 
The objective of this study is to compare the noninvasive oxyge n saturation (SpO
2) performance of the Masimo 
noninvasive INVSENSOR00006 sensor against an arterial blood sam ple analyzed by a laboratory CO-oximeter 
reference instrument.  Data using the noninvasive devices will be collected from healthy volunteers undergoing a 
desaturation procedure. 
This is a nonrandomized single arm study wherein all subjects a re enrolled into the experimental arm and receive 
the INVSENSOR00006 sensor on one or more fingers.  Desaturation  will be conducted by reducing the concentration 
of oxygen the study subject breathes in a controlled manner to obtain noninvasive oxygen saturation readings, SpO 2, 
at various levels.  Reference blood samples will be repeatedly collected from the subject and analyzed using a 
standard laboratory CO-oximeter.  The performance of the sensor s will be calculated using Accuracy root mean 
square (A RMS) analysis of the SpO 2 values and the reference CO-oximeter values.   
Outcome Measure:  
Performance of the sensors will be determined by comparing the noninvasive oxygen saturation measurement 
(SpO 2) of the pulse oximeter sensors to the arterial oxygen saturati on (SaO2) value obtained from a reference blood 
sample and calculating the A RMS value. 
2. BACKGROUND 
Masimo Corporation develops non-invasive medical technologies.  These devices have applications in the operating 
room, critical care unit, emergency room, emergency transport v ehicles, as well as physician’s offices. 
 An invasive blood sample analyzed by a CO-oximeter reference in strument gives the best measure of arterial oxygen 
concentration as well as other blood solutes, but cannot  measu re these parameters continuously and requires skin 
puncture, arterial line placement and subsequent risk of infect ion, hematoma, and other physiological damage.  
Masimo SET and Masimo Rainbow technologies allow real-time, non -invasive monitoring of oxygen saturation (and 
other blood solutes) and has the potential to improve clinical outcomes while reducing the cost of care and risks to 
both patients and clinicians associated with arterial and venou s punctures. 
2.1. Technology Background 
 Pulse oximetry is governed by the following principles: 
x Oxyhemoglobin (oxygenated blood) and deoxyhemoglobin (non-oxyge nated blood) differ in their 
absorption of red and infrared light (spectrophotometry).  
x The amount of arterial blood in tissue changes with arterial pu lses (photoplethysmography).  Therefore, 
the amount of light absorbed by the varying quantities of arter ial blood changes as well.

 x The CO-Oximeter utilizes a sensor with various light-emitting d iodes (LEDs) that pass light through the 
site to a photodiode (detector).  See figure below.   
 
 
x Signal data is obtained by passing various visible and infrared  lights through a capillary bed (for example, 
a fingertip, a hand, a foot) and measuring changes in light abs orption during the blood pulsatile cycle.  
The maximum radiant power of the strongest light is limited to ≤ 25mW.  The detector receives the light, 
converts it into an electronic signal and sends it to the Masim o hardware (e.g. Rad-57, Radical-7) for 
calculation.  Once the oximeter receives the signal from the se nsor, it utilizes Masimo SET signal 
extraction technology for calculation of the patient’s function al oxygen saturation, pulse rate and other 
blood parameters. 
2.2. Study Devices 
Investigational sensor : INVSENSOR00006 
The INVSENSOR00006 sensor is a modification to Masimo’s rainbow  line of sensors.  It utilizes 4 LED 
wavelengths instead of 8 and requires a different calibration c urve to measure SpO 2.  This study will validate 
that the 4 LED design meets the accuracy requirements for SpO 2 (A RMS ≤ 2 % SpO 2) when compared to 
laboratory reference CO-oximeter SaO 2 values. 
 
FDA Cleared Sensors and Devices: 
Masimo Root Patient Monitoring Platform: Root is a patient moni toring and connectivity platform that 
offers rainbow® and Masimo SET® measurements with other parameters in an integrated platform. With 
docking capabilities for the Radical-7® handheld monitor and multiple networking/connectivity options,  Root 
integrates multiple streams of data into one display monitor.  
Masimo Radical-7 Pulse Oximeter: The Masimo Radical-7 pulse oxi meter is a noninvasive monitoring 
platform featuring Masimo SET Measure-through Motion and Low Pe rfusion™ pulse oximetry with the 
option to measure multiple additional blood constituents and ph ysiologic parameters.

7.2. RECRUITMENT AND PRESCREENING 
Subjects will be recruited using IRB-approved advertisements.  Subjects may be referred to the 
study by previous subjects.  Subjects are contacted via phone c all to conduct a prescreening 
interview to determine their initial eligibility for the study.   Potential eligible subjects are scheduled 
for a study visit to the clinical laboratory. 
7.3         CONSENTING AND SCREENING 
7.3.1.  Study staff will discuss the informed consent process and the s tudy with the potential 
subjects.  The subjects will be provided with enough time to re ad and understand the 
informed consent document and their questions will be answered by study staff prior to the 
subject signing the informed consent form.  No study related ac tivities will be conducted 
until consent is signed. 
7.3.2.  The subject’s weight and height are self-reported, however the subject may be weighed on 
a scale for verification. 
7.3.3.  Subjects will be asked to provide a copy of their valid governm ent photo ID and/or Social 
Security Number (SSN) card to verify subject identity.  The cop ies of these forms of 
identification will be stored along with the subject’s consent.   The confidentiality and 
retention of these documents will be protected to the extent pr ovided and required by law.  
7.3.4.  Subjects will be asked a brief series of health questions to en sure their eligibility for this 
study.  Subjects who do not meet the inclusion and exclusion cr iteria will not be eligible to 
participate in the study.   
7.3.5.  Subject demographic information including age, sex, skin tone, ethnicity, height and weight 
will be collected.  These may be recorded for data analysis and /or subject safety monitoring 
purposes. 
7.3.6.  In addition, a medical history will be recorded after the initi al screening questionnaire. 
7.3.7.  Pre-procedure vital signs will be recorded for subject safety m onitoring.  Spikes in blood 
pressure and heart rate can be expected during line placement, needle sticks, blood draws 
etc. and may also be attributed to anxiety/nervousness relating  to a new environment.  Only 
the initial recorded blood pressure and/or heart rate determine s a subject’s qualification for 
the study. 
7.3.8.  Female subjects will be required to take a pregnancy test.  Res ults will be noted in study 
documentation.  If the pregnancy test is positive, the subject will be notified and removed 
from the study.

7.4. PROCEDURES 
7.4.1.  Standard hospital-type monitors will be placed on the subject, including ECG, blood 
pressure, and a reference pulse oximeter for safety monitoring by medical staff.  
7.4.2 Proprietary Masimo data collection software will be used to ver ify all oximeters are reading.  
If not, proper sensor positioning will be checked and sensors m ay be repositioned, as 
needed.  
7.4.2.1  Pulse oximeter output values (e.g., SpO 2, Pulse rate) will be recorded using the 
proprietary Masimo data collection software.  These values matc h the values 
calculated by the instrument at runtime. 
7.4.2.2  Raw absorbance data from the noninvasive device(s) will also be  recorded using the 
data collection software. 
7.4.3 A peripheral venous line will be placed in the subject’s hand o r arm.  This line may be used 
for the qualifying venous blood draw and for safety or clinical  intervention required during 
the study. 
7.4.4 Local anesthetics such as lidocaine, ethyl chloride spray, or P ain Ease skin refrigerant spray 
may be used in the event that an IV is placed to numb the site.   Subjects will be given the 
option to have lidocaine or numbing spray be used during IV pla cement for the purpose of 
making catheter placement more comfortable for the subjects. 
7.4.5 After intravenous access is established, one or more intra-arte rial catheter(s) (arterial line or 
A-line) will be placed in the radial artery of the subject’s wr ist.  The A-line is placed to 
facilitate continuous blood pressure measurement for subject sa fety monitoring, and/or to 
enable repeated removal of blood aliquots for reference arteria l blood gases (ABG), Hgb, 
Hct, as well as other non-infectious blood solutes. 
7.4.6 After arterial access is established, sensors will be placed on  the required sensor sites.  
Depending on the sensor design, these may include the subject’s  fingers, toes, ears, nose, 
and/or forehead.   
7.4.7 Subjects may be warmed using equipment such as blankets or heat ing pads, according to 
ISO 80601 EE.2.3.3. 
7.4.8 Upon successful placement of the sensors and the subject’s indi cation that they are 
comfortable, a baseline set of blood samples will be obtained.  
7.4.9 Arterial blood samples may be drawn consecutively during the pr ocedure at different 
saturation levels.  No more than 100 samples of approximately 1 -4 cc each may be drawn 
including blood drawn to flush the line and prepare for new sam ples. A maximum total of 
250 cc of blood may be taken per subject.

 7.4.10  Subjects will wear a nose clip or nose plugs during the desatur ation procedure.  A 
mouthpiece will be placed in the subject’s mouth.  Upon indicat ion the subject is 
comfortable, a gas mixture will be administered through the mou thpiece.  The proportion of 
oxygen in this mixture will be decreased in a controlled manner  to lower the subject’s blood 
oxygen saturation.  The lowest targeted value will be 70% oxyge n saturation.  Readings near 
70% will be immediately verified by the reference CO-oximeter t o ensure that levels are 
within the targeted oxygen saturation range and to minimize tim e that the subject may drop 
below the targeted range. Note: At any point in the study, if t he subject feels 
uncomfortable, the subject will be given 100% oxygen through ei ther the mouthpiece or a 
supplemental mask.  
7.4.11  Subjects may undergo the desaturation procedure up to 2 times.  
7.4.12  The timing of the blood samples will be entered into the data c ollection software. 
7.4.13  To allow for pulse oximeter instrument response times, the subj ect should be at the desired 
saturation level for at least 30 seconds before and after a blo od sample is taken. 
7.4.14  The study will end with several minutes at a FiO 2 greater than room air (>21%) to help the 
subject re-saturate after the procedures.  
7.4.15  If at any point the subject is uncomfortable with the study, th e study will be stopped. 
7.4.16  At the conclusion of the procedure, the sensors/devices, IV(s),  and arterial line(s) will be 
removed and the subject will be allowed to leave after medical personnel determine it is 
safe to do so.  
7.4.17  The total procedure time will be approximately 180 minutes. 
7.4.18  All subjects will be encouraged to remain in the study area unt il they feel fit to leave; 
subjects should feel safe and able before returning to work dir ectly after participation in the 
study.  
7.4.19  Subjects will be given instructions on wound care.  All subject s will be instructed to contact 
the principal investigator or study staff in the event of any p otential complication. 
7.4.20  Subjects will be paid for their time. 
7.4.21  Subjects will be provided with information related to any signi ficant new findings that 
develop at any time during the study which may relate to their willingness to continue their 
participation.

 All adverse events that occur during the study shall be recorde d on the Case Report Form even if the 
investigator/study staff assess the adverse event as unlikely t o be causally related to the test device 
or study procedures. 
10.2. Serious Adverse Events 
The investigator/study staff shall promptly report both serious  adverse events and unanticipated 
adverse device effects to the sponsor within 48 hours.  All ser ious adverse events will also be 
reported to the IRB per IRB reporting requirements.  
At the time of discharge from the study, any unresolved serious  adverse event(s) will be followed up 
by the investigator/study staff until the event(s) are resolved , stabilized or the patient is lost to 
follow-up or the adverse event is otherwise explained.  The inv estigator and/or study staff  will also 
instruct the subject to report any subsequent events occurring in the next 30 days, which the 
subject or the subject’s physician believes might reasonably be  regarded as caused by or have a 
reasonable possibility of being caused by the test device or pr ocedures involved in the study.  
10.3. Unanticipated Problems 
Any unanticipated problem involving subjects will be reported t o the IRB, such as protocol violations 
or deviations as required by the IRB reporting procedures. 
11. SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION AND OPERATIONAL CONSIDERATIONS  
11.1 Measures Taken to Protect the Rights and Welfare of Subjects 
11.1.1  All subjects will be monitored closely throughout the study.  T here will be an ACLS certified 
medical doctor present in the study area throughout the study. 
11.1.2  The following measures will be taken to ensure the confidential ity of the subjects: 
11.1.2.1  A code (identification) number for each subject will be kept on  file. 
11.1.2.2  Only their corresponding identification number will identify su bjects. 
11.1.2.3  Access to identifying documents (IC, SSN, photo ID) and data wi ll only be made to 
the principal investigators in the study and study staff. 
11.1.2.4  The confidentiality and retention of these documents will be pr otected to the 
extent provided and required by the law. 
11.2 Vulnerable Populations 
11.2.1  Employees are considered to be a vulnerable population.

protecting the network.  
x 4 layers of email security systems for protecting against phish ing attacks. 
x Security policies to limit access to specific folders. 
12. DEVICE ACCOUNTABILITY 
12.1 Receipt of Study Device 
Upon receipt of the study device supplies, an inventory must be  performed and the device 
accountability log filled out and signed by the person acceptin g the shipment.  It is important that 
the designated study staff counts and verifies that the shipmen t contains all the items noted in the 
shipment inventory.  Any damaged or unusable study devices in a  given shipment will be 
documented in the study files.   
12.2 Use of Study Device 
Use of devices and sensors will be documented on Case Report Fo rms for each subject. 
12.3 Return or Destruction of Study Device 
At the completion of the study, there will be a final reconcili ation of study devices and sensors 
shipped, devices/sensors used, and devices/sensors remaining.  This reconciliation will be logged on 
the device accountability log.  Any discrepancies noted will be  investigated, resolved, and 
documented prior to return or destruction of unused study devic es.  Devices destroyed on site will 
only be upon written instruction from the sponsor and will be d ocumented in the study files. 
13. RISKS AND BENEFITS 
13.1. Benefits: There will be no benefit to the subject.  Other possi ble benefits would be to society as a 
whole.  Evaluation of the accuracy of this new device could ena ble healthcare workers to more 
appropriately treat potentially life threatening conditions. 
13.2. Device Risks: The noninvasive devices used in this study are si milar in technology and design to 
some commercially available pulse oximeters and other non-invas ive devices and hence have the 
same risks.  Pulse oximeters and other non-invasive devices are  commonly used and are considered 
to be minimal risk.  There is an extremely small risk of damage  to the subject’s fingers, or other 
locations where sensors are placed, from the device including t emporary skin irritation or 
discomfort associated with exposure to the sensor as well as po tential temporary mechanical 
irritation or discomfort.  There is a remote, yet possible, ris k of a burn from the sensor. In the case of 
a sensor burn there is the potential for permanent skin damage (scar/discoloration). 
13.3. Venous Cannulation Risks: swelling, infection, infiltration of fluids/ blood into area surrounding IV, 
bruising, hematoma, lightheadedness, fainting, feeling flush/wa rm, feeling nauseated, throwing up,

 sudden drop in blood pressure/sudden increase in blood pressure , sudden drop in heart 
rate/sudden increa se in heart rate, tingl ing sensation of face,  arms and/or legs, sweating, mouth 
dryness, damage to the blood  vessel and surrounding nerves or t issue. 
13.4. Arterial Cannulation risks: decreas ed blood supply, blood clot,  embolization, infection, hematoma, 
damage to the blood vessel and surrounding nerves, tendons or t issue; loss of feeling in hand and/or 
arm and even the loss of hand due to rare complications of the study. 
13.5. Blood Draw risks: discomfort is generally associated with needl e puncture.  The most common 
complications associated with blood draws and capillary sticks are hematomas or bruising.  All blood 
draws will be performed by qualified personnel.  An ACLS certif ied physician will be in attendance 
throughout the entire procedure, and the study will be complete d under their general supervision.  
Other anticipated adverse events that may occur, include but ar e not limited to: vasovagal (passing 
out/fainting), infection to the skin or area right below the sk in, lightheadedness, feeling flush/ warm, 
feeling nauseated, throwing up, seizures, sudden drop in blood pressure/ sudden increase in blood 
pressure, sudden drop in h eart rate/ sudden increase in heart r ate, tingling sensation of face/arms 
and/or sweating, and mouth dryness.  These anticipated adverse events are expected to be 
temporary. 
13.6. Risk From Oxygen Administration:  There are no risks associated  with high oxygen/oxygen 
administration for less than 24 hours as long as subjects do no t have any cardiac conditions, COPD 
or any other lung diseases.  Subjects’ answers on the health qu estionnaire will help the medical staff 
decide if they can safely participate in this study; subjects a re encouraged to let the study staff know 
if they have any concerns. 
13.7. Low Oxygen Concentration Risks: Risks associated with hypoxia i nclude dizziness, shortness of 
breath, drowsiness, or headache. If or when this occurs, the st udy can be stopped. There is an 
extremely small risk of loss of consciousness, damage to vital organs, or death from lack of oxygen. 
The study shall be stopped by the subject or clinical staff lon g before this could occur.  Other 
anticipated adverse events that may occur, include but are not limited to:  vasovagal (passing 
out/fainting), lightheadedness, feeling nauseated, throwing up,  seizures, sudden drop in blood 
pressure/sudden increase in blood pressure, sudden drop in hear t rate/sudden increase in heart 
rate, tingling sensation of face, arms and/or legs, sweating, m outh dryness.  These anticipated 
adverse events are expected to be temporary. 
13.8. Nose Clip Risks: It is expected that some people will have disc omfort/ pinching/ scratches from 
wearing a nose clip. If this occurs, adjustments can be made an d/or the study can be stopped. 
13.9. Risk from Inflicted Knowledge: The risk of inflicted medical kn owledge to subjects is negligible since 
we deidentify all associated sample information including those  relevant to our clinical and 
engineering parameter studies.  The monitoring and test results  are not examined for diagnostic 
purposes and do not reflect an attempt to ascertain any subject 's medical condition.  The attending 
physician's role during this study is to ensure the safety of t he subject during the study. Subjects are 
informed that these are not diagnostic tools, if observations a re made using FDA cleared devices we 
will refer them to their primary care physician. 
13.10.  Risk From Loss of Confidentiality: Masimo upholds the highest s tandards to protect hard and 
electronic data however, a complete promise for confidentiality  cannot be guaranteed due to 
unforeseeable events. 
13.11.  Risk From Additional Testing:

 13.11.1.  During the conduct of the study, it is possible, but not likely , that someone could become 
exposed to the sample of blood drawn from the subject through a n inadvertent needle 
stick or by contact with an open cut. In such circumstances, it  will be important to the 
exposed individual to know whether the blood to which he or she  was exposed contained 
Hepatitis B virus (HBV), Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), or  Hepatitis C virus (HCV) 
and additional testing of the sample will be performed. 
13.11.2.  Within the consent, subjects will agree to permit the company t o test the blood sample 
(or samples) by signing the consent.  The test results will be maintained as confidential 
and will only be used by healthcare professionals for the diagn osis and treatment of the 
exposed individual as appropriate.  
13.11.3.  In the case that Masimo needs to contact a subject regarding ad ditional testing they will be 
contacted by a Masimo employee and medical personnel can be ava ilable for further 
counsel if requested.  
13.11.4.  The cost for the initial testing and compensation for their tim e/travel to the testing facility 
will be the only things paid for by Masimo. 
13.12.  Lidocaine (injection) Risks:  Insertion of the Lidocaine may be  discomforting and can feel like a slight 
pinch along with a warm/burning sensation.  Other anticipated a dverse events that may occur, 
include but are not limited to: Flushing or redness of the skin , itching skin, small red or purple spots 
on the skin, unusually warm skin, bruising, bleeding at the app lication site, and swelling. These 
adverse events are expected to be temporary. 
13.13.  Although not common, it is also possible to have an allergic re action to injectable lidocaine.  
Subjects should not take part in this study if they are allergi c to lidocaine injection or other types of 
numbing medicine, or if they have a heart rhythm disorder such as Wolff-Parkinson-White 
Syndrome or Stokes-Adams syndrome.  Subjects are instructed to tell the study staff right away if 
they experience hives; difficulty breathing; swelling of your f ace, lips, tongue or throat. 
13.14.  Ethyl Chloride (Lidocaine Spray): Ethyl Chloride is a topical a nesthetic which is used to prevent pain 
by cooling the skin. Although unlikely, the anticipated adverse  events that may occur, include but 
are not limited to: changes in skin color (i.e. Flushing or red ness of the skin), delayed wound healing, 
rash, itching and swelling.  These adverse events are expected to be temporary. 
14. EMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN FOR MEDICAL EMERGENCIES  
The physician and nurse present during the study will be ACLS c ertified and will respond to any medical 
emergency involving a subject with the ACLS approved protocol f or intervention.  A crash cart is on site and 
full emergency services are within 3 miles. 
15. MONITORING PLAN 
A separate document for the study monitoring plan will be devel oped and followed to ensure subject safety 
and GCP compliance.   
16. PROTOCOL DEVIATIONS AND AMENDMENTS 
Deviations to the protocol will be documented on the Case Repor t Form or a separate document.  Protocol 
deviations will be reported to the sponsor and IRB per IRB repo rting guidelines. 
Modifications to the protocol, informed consent materials, recr uitment materials, or any other materials 
provided to subjects must be reviewed and approved by the IRB.

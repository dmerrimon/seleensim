3.3 Benefit /Risk/Assessment
Abatacept i s a fully human fusi on protein representing a new class of therapeuti c agent known as 
a select ive costimulat ion modulator wi th potenti al for immunom odulator y activity. This expected 
activit y should be taken into consideration in caring for human participants participating in clinical 
trials with abatacept. Invest igators should be alert to signs of infection in participants, and 
participants shoul d be cauti oned to report any  signs of infect ion, such as fever, sore throat, cough 
or unusual appearances of skin lesions (swelling, warmth, tenderness, or exudate) to their 
physician without delay. The risks of infecti on occurring in the currently proposed single dose
study , however, are expected to be very  low.

This study  is in healthy participants, a populat ion that would not receive any health benefi t from 
participat ing in this study . Although thi s single dose study  for norm al heal thy partici pants shoul d 
not pose an unacceptable health risk to participants based on the established safet y profile of 
abatacept, in order to minimize the overall risk to participants, this protocol  has inclusio n and 
exclusio n criteria appropri ate to the population and proposed dosing, ex clusionary  screening tests 
(tuberculosis testing, chest x-ray, medical history , physical  examination), and specific follow-up 
safet y assessments. Adverse events and SAEs will be reviewed on an ongoi ng basis by the BMS 
Medical Monitor and by the BMS Pharmac ovigilance Department to look for trends and any safet y 
issues.
Risks from the PK, immunogenicit y, and clinical  safety phlebotomy  procedures are standard and 
include infection, bleeding, bruising, blood clot form ation, disco mfort at the inject ion site, and
(rarely) faint ing.

4 OBJECTIVES AND ENDPOINTS
Table 4 -1: Objectives and Endpoints
Objectives Endpoints
Primary
To compare the PK of the abatacept drug product converted from drug 
substance by a new drug substance process (Treatment A) relative to the 
current drug substance process (Treatment B) following a single dose ( 750 
mg)IV infusion in healthy participants.Cmax and AUC(INF) of abatacept
Secondary
To assess the safety of a single dose ( 750-mg )IV infusion of the abatacept 
drug product converted from drug substance by a new drug substance 
process (Treatment A) versus drug substance by the current drug 
substance process (Treatment B).Safety assessments will be based on 
medical review of AErepor ts, vital 
sign measurements, ECGs, physical 
examinations, and clinical 
laborato ry tests.
To assess the immunogenicity of abatacept drug product converted from 
drug substance by a new drug substance process (Treatment A) versus 
drug substance by the curren t drug substance process (Treatment B).Immunogenicity determination will 
be based on the incidence of 
laborato ry-reported positive 
responses and titers of anti -
abatacept antibodies specific for 
“CTLA4 and possibly Ig” and “Ig 
and/o r Junction Region.”
To characterize the PK of abatacept drug product converted from drug 
substance by a new drug substance process (Treatment A) versus drug 
substance by the current drug substance process (Treatment B).Tmax, AUC(0 -T), AUC(0 -28 day),

5 STUDY DESIGN
5.1 Overall Design
This is an open -label, rando mized, parallel group , single- dose study  in healt hy participants 
following IV administration of abatacept. 
Parti cipants will undergo screening evaluat ions to determine eligibilit y within 28 days prior to 
drug administration on Day 1. All partici pants are required to weigh between 60 and 100 kg, 
inclusive, and should be weighed using the same scale at each site. 
Parti cipants will be admi tted to the clinical facilit y the day prior to dosing (Day -1) and will be 
confined unt il at least 24 hours post- dose. 
On Day 1, eligible participants will be rando mized in a 1:1 ratio. The randomizat ion will be 
stratified by weight categories: 60 to < 70 kg, 70to< 80 kg,80 to < 90 kg, and 
90to≤ 100 kg. Within each weight category , participants will be rando mly assigned to abatacept 
drug product converted from drug substance by a new drug substance process (Treatm ent A) or 
abatacept drug product converted from drug substance by the current drug substance process
(Treatm ent B) in a 1:1 rati o. A minimum of 1 0participants per treatm ent per weight categ ory are 
planned to be rando mized .
In order to decrease variabilit y, the goal of the treatm ent group assignment is to match each 
participant 1:1by weight category  to a participant with the opposi te treatm ent assignment. 
Randomization numbers will be sequent ial within each weight category, starting wit h 1001, 2001, 
3001, and 4001 for 60 to < 70 kg, 70to< 80 kg, 80 to < 90 kg, and 90 to ≤ 100 kg weight 
categor ies, respectively.
On Day  1, parti cipants will receive a single IV infusion of either Treatment A or Treatment B at a 
dose of 750 mg over approximately 30 minutes using a calibrated, constant -rate infusio n pum p.
The study  design schemat ic is presented in Figure 5.1 -1.

In the morning on Day  1, af ter fast ing for at least 1 hour, each parti cipant will receive a single IV 
dose of abatacept.
The start time of the IV dose administration will be called “0” hour.
Restrictions related to food and fluid intake are described in Sect ion6.3.
7.2 Method of Treatment Assignment
Parti cipants will be rando mized on Day 1 in a 1:1 ratio to either Treatment A or Treatment B
groups. The randomization will be stratified by weight categories: 60 to <70 kg, 70 to < 80kg, 
80to < 90 kg, and 90 to≤ 100 kg according to a c omputer generated rando mizat ion scheme 
prepared by  ICON.
Within each weight category, participants will be randomly assigned to abatacept drug product 
converted from drug substance by a new drug substance process (Treatment A) or abatacept drug 
product converted from drug substance by the current drug substance process (Treatment B).
In order to decrease variabilit y, the goal of the treatm ent group assignment is to match each 
participant 1:1by weight category to a participant with the opposi te treatm ent assignment . A 
minimum o f 10participants per treatm ent per weight category are planned to be randomized .
Randomization numbers will be sequent ial within each weight category, starting wit h 1001, 2001, 
3001, and 4001 for 60 to < 70 kg, 70to< 80 kg, 80 to < 90 kg, and 90 to ≤ 100 kg weight 
categori es, respectively. A copy  of the randomization listing will be provi ded to the pharmacist 
prior to study  initiation.
Enrolled participants, including those not dosed, will  be assigned sequent ial participant numbers 
starting with 00001 (eg, 00001, 00002, 00003.... 00010). Sequent ial numbering may restart at 
00001 for each part icipating site as the dist inct patient ident ification number (PID) will ult imately 
be comprised of the site number and participant number, (eg, 0002- 00001). Those enrolled 
participants meet ing inclusio n and exclusio n criteria will be eligib le to be randomized. 
Randomization numbers will be assigned prior to dosing.

Parti cipants will not be replaced if they are discontinued from the study  secondary  to an  adverse 
event unless the adverse event can be determined to be unrelated to treatm ent. If a participant is 
replaced after dosing, the replacement participant will be identified from the same site and from 
the same weight category to the discontinued participant. The replacement participant will receive 
the sam e treatm ent as the parti cipant th at was di scontinued but a new randomizat ion number will 
be assigned to him or her. The new randomizat ion number will be the original randomizat ion

9 STUDY ASSESSMENTS AND PROCEDURES
Study  procedures and timing are summarized in the S chedule of Activities. 
Protocol  waivers or exempt ions are not allowed .
All immediate safet y concerns must bediscussed with the Sponsor immediately upon 
occur rence or awareness to determine if the participant should continue or discontinue 
treatm ent.
Adherence to the study  design requi rements, including those specified in the Schedule of 
Activities, is essenti al and requi red for study  conduct.
All screening evaluations must be completed and reviewed to confirm that potential 
participants m eet all eligibilit y criteria before randomizat ion. The invest igator will maintain a 
screening log to record details of all participants screened and to confi rm eligibili ty or record 
reasons for scr eening failure, as applicable.
Procedures conducted as part of the participant’s routine clinical management (eg, blood count)

purposes provided the procedure meets the protocol -defined criteria and has been performed 
within the t imeframe defined in the S chedule of Activit ies.
9.1 Efficacy Assessments
Not applicable.
9.2 Adverse Events
The definit ions of an AE or serious adverse event (SAE) can be found i n Appendix 3.
AEs will be reported by the participant (or, when appropriate, by a caregiver, surrogate, or the 
participant's legally  authori zed representative). 
The invest igator and any designees are responsible for detecting, docum enting, and reporting 
events that meet the definit ion of an AE or SAE and remain responsible for following up AEs that 
are serious, considered related to the study treatment or the stud y, or that caused the participant to 
discontinue before complet ing the study. 
Contacts for SAE reporting specified in Appendix 3.
9.2.1 Time Period and Frequency for Collecting AE and SAE Information
Secti ons 5.6.1 and 5.6.2 in the Investigator Brochure (IB) represent the Reference Safet y 
Inform ation to determine expectedness of SAEs for expedited reporting.

The investigator must report any SAE that occurs af ter these time periods and that is believed to 
be related to study  treatm entor protocol -specified procedure (eg, a follow- up skin biopsy ).
All nonserious AEs must be collected at the start of study  treatm ent unt il the timepo ints specified 
in the Schedule of Act ivities (Section 2).
Medical occurrences that begin befo re the start of study treatment but after obtaining informed 
consent will be recorded on the appropriate section of the eCRF module.
All SAEs will be recorded and reported to Sponsor or designee within 24 hours , as i ndicated 
in Appendix 3. 
The invest igator will submit any updated SAE data to the sponsor or designee within 24 hours
ofupdated informat ion being available.
Invest igators are not obligated to actively seek AEs or SAEs in former study  participants. 
However, if the invest igator learnsof any SAE, including a death, at any time after a participant 
has been discharged fro m the study, and he/she considers the event reasonably related to the study 
treatm ent or study  parti cipat ion, the invest igator must prompt ly notify the sponsor.
The method of evaluat ing, and assessing causality  of AEs and SAEs and the procedures for 
completing and reporting/ transmi tting SAE reports are provided in Appendix 3.
9.2.2 Method of Detecting AEs and SAEs
Adverse events can be spontaneously reported or elicited during open -ended quest ioning, 
examinat ion, or evaluation of a participant . Care shoul d be taken not to introduce bias when 
collect ing AE and/or SAEs. Inquiry about specific AEs sh ould be guided by clinical judgment in 
the context of known adverse events, when ap propri ate for the program or protocol.
9.2.3 Follow -up of AEs and SAEs
Nonserious AEs shoul d be followed to resol ution or stabilizat ion, or reported as SAEs if they 
beco me serious (see Section Appendix 3).
Follow-up is also requi red for nonserious AEs that cause interruption or discont inuation of 
study  treatm ent and for those present at the end of study  treatm ent as appropri ate.
 All ident ified nonserious AEs must be recorded and described on the nonseri ous AE page of 
the CRF (paper or electronic). Com pletion of suppl emental  CRFs may be requested for AEs 
and/or laboratory  abnorm alities that are reported/ident ified during the course of the study .
All SAEs will be followed until resolution, until the condi tion stabilizes, until the event is 
otherwi se explained, or until the participant is lost to fo llow-up (as defined in Sect ion8.3).
Further informat ion on fo llow-up procedures i s given in Appendix 3.
9.2.4 Regulatory Reporting Requirements for SAEs
Prom pt notificat ion by the invest igator to the Sponsor of SAEs is essent ial so that legal 
obligat ions and ethical responsibilit ies towards the safet y of participants and the safet y of a 
product under clinical investigation a re met.

safet y information (eg, summary  or listing of SAEs) from the Sponsor will file it along with 
the Invest igator’s Brochure and will notify  the IRB/IEC, if appropri ate according to local 
requi rements.
Sponsor or designee will be reporting AEs to regul atory  authori ties and ethics committees 
according to local applicable laws including European Directive 2001/20/EC and FDA Code of 
Federal Regulat ions 21 CFR Parts 312 and 320. A SUSAR (Suspected, Unexpected Serious 
Adverse React ion) is a su bset of SAEs and will be reported to the appropriate regul atory  authori ties 
and invest igators following local and glo bal guidelines and requirements.
9.2.5 Pregnancy
If, following initiation of the study  treatm ent, it is subsequent ly discovered that a participant is 
pregnant or may have been pregnant at the time of study exposure, including during at least 
5half-lives after product administration, the investigator must immediately notify the BMS 
Medical Monitor/designee of this event and complete and forward a Pregnan cy Surveillance Form 
to BMS Designee within 24 hours of awareness of the event and in accordance with SAE reporting 
procedures described in Appendix 3.
If the invest igator determines a possible favorable benefit/risk rati o that warrants continuat ion of 
study treatm ent, or re -initiation of study treatment, a discussio n between the invest igator and the 
BMS Medical Moni tor/desi gnee must occur. If, for whatever reason, thepregnancy has ended , 
confirmed by negat ive serum pregnancy test, treatment may  be resumed (at least 3 weeks and not 
greater than 6 weeks after thepregnancy has ended ), following approval s of participant /sponsor 
/IRB/EC, as applicable.
Follow-up informat ion regarding the course of the pregnancy, including perinatal  and neonatal 
outcom e and, where applicable, offspring informat ion,must be reported on the Pregnanc y 
Surveillance Form.
Any pregnancy that occurs in a female partner of a male study  participant should be reported to 
Sponsor or designee . In order for Sponsor or designee to collect any pregnancy surveillance 
inform ation from the female partner, the female partner must sign an informed consent form for 
disclosure of this informat ion. Inform ation on this pregnancy will be collected on the Pregnancy 
Surveillance Form.
9.2.6 Laboratory Test Resu lt Abnormalities

COMPLIANCE WITH THE PROTOCOL AND PROTOCO L REVISIONS
The invest igator should not implement any deviati on o r change to the protocol  without prior 
review and docum ented approval /favorabl e opini on of an amendment from the IRB/IEC (and if 
applicable, also by local health authori ty) except where necessary to eliminate an immediate 
hazard(s) to study  subjects. 
If adeviat ion or change to a protocol is implemented to eliminate an immediate hazard(s) prior to 
obtaining relevant  approval/favorable opinio n(s) the deviat ion or change will be submi tted, as 
soon as possible to:
IRB/IEC
Regulatory  Authori ty(ies), if applic able by  local regul ations (per nat ional requirements)
Docum entati on of approval /favorabl e opinio n signed by the chairperson or designee of the 
IRB(s)/IEC(s) and if applicable, also by local healt h authorit y must be sent to BMS.
If an amendment substant ially alters the study  design or increases the potential risk to the 
participant: (1) the consent form must be revised and submi tted to th e IRB(s)/IEC(s) for review 
and approval/favorable opinio n; (2) the revised form must be used to obtain consent from subjec ts 
currently enrolled in the study  if they are affected by the amendment; and (3) the new form must 
be used to obtain consent from new subjects prior to enrollment.
If the revisio n is done via an administrative letter, investigators must inform their IRB(s)/IEC(s).
FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE
Invest igators and sub-Invest igators will provi de the Sponsor with sufficient, accurate financia l 
inform ation in accordance with local regulati ons to allow the Sponsor to submit complete and 
accurate financial certificati on or disclosure statem ents to the appropriate healt h authori ties. 
Invest igators are responsible for provi ding information on financial interests during the course of 
the study  and f or 1 year after complet ion of the study .

CASE REPORT FORMS
An investigator is required to prepare and maintain adequate and accurate case histories designed 
to record all observat ions and other data pertinent to the invest igation on each individual treated 
or entered as a control in the invest igation. Data that are derived from source documents and 
reported on the CRF must be consistent with the source documents or the discrepancies must be 
explain ed. Addit ional clinical informat ion may be collected and analyzed in an effort to enhance 
understanding o f product safet y. CRFs may  be requested for AEs and/or laboratory  abnorm alities 
that are reported or ident ified during the course of the study .
For sites using the Sponsor or designee electronic data capture tool, electroni c CRFs will be 
prepared for all data collect ion fields except for fields specific to SAEs and pregnancy, which will 
be reported on the electroni c SAE form and Pregnancy Surveillance form, respect ively. If 
electroni c SAE form is not available, a paper SAE form can be used. Spaces may be left blank 
only in those circumstances permitted by study -specific CRF completion guidelines provi ded by 
Sponsor or designee. 
The confidentialit y of records that could ident ify subjects must be protected, respecting the privacy 
and confidentialit y rules in accordance wi th the applicable regulatory  requi rement(s).
The invest igator will maintain a signature sheet to document signatures and initials of all p ersons 
authori zed to m ake entri es and/or corrections on CRFs. 
The co mpleted CRF, SAE/pregnancy CRFs, must be pro mptly reviewed, signed, and dated by the 
investigator or qualified physician who is a subinvesti gator and who is delegated thi s task on the 
Delegati on of  Authori ty Form. Subinvest igators in Japan may not be delegated the CRF approval 
task. For electroni c CRFs, review and approval/signature is completed electroni cally through the 
BMS electroni c data capture tool. The invest igator must retain a copy of the CRFs including 
records of the changes and corrections.
Each individual electronically signing electroni c CRFs must meet Sponsor or designee training 
requi rements and must only access the BMS electronic data capture tool using the unique user 
accou nt provided by Sponsor or designee. User accounts are not to be shared or reassigned to other 
individuals.
MONITORING
Representatives of BMS must be allowed to visit all study  site locati ons peri odically to assess the 
data qualit y and study  integrity. On s ite they  will review study  records and directly co mpare them 
with source docum ents, discuss the conduct of the study  with the invest igator, and verify that the 
facilit ies remain acceptable. Certain CRF pages and/or electronic files may serve as the source 
docum ents:
In addi tion, the study  may be evaluated by  Sponsor or desi gnee internal auditors and government 
inspectors who must be allowed access to CRFs, source documents, other study  files, and study 
facilit ies. BMS audit reports will be kept confidential .
The investigator must notify BMS prom ptly of any inspect ions scheduled by regulatory authori ties, 
and prompt ly forward copi es of  inspect ion reports to Sponsor or designee.

APPENDIX 3 ADVERSE EVENTS AND S ERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT S: 
DEFINITIONS AND PROC EDURES FOR RECORDING , 
EVALUATING, FOLLOW U P AND REPORTING
ADVERSE EVENTS
Adverse Event Definition:
An Adverse Event (AE) i s defi ned as any  new untoward m edical  occurrence or worsening of a 
preexist ing medical condit ion in a c linical invest igation partici pant administered study  treatm ent
and that does not necessarily  have a causal  relati onship wi th this treatm ent. 
An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (such as an abnorm al laboratory 
finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use o f study treatment, whether or 
not consi dered rel ated to the study  treatment.
Events Meeting the AE Definition
Any abnorm al laboratory  test results (hematol ogy, clinical chemistry , or urinalysis) or 
resul ts from other safet y assessments (eg, ECG, radio logical scans, vital signs 
measurements), including those that worsen from baseline, considered clinically signi ficant 
in the medical and scientific judgment of the investigator. Note that abnormal lab tests or 
other safet y assessments shoul d only be reported as AEs if the final diagnosis is not 
available. Once the final diagnosis is known, the reported term  shouldbe updated to be the 
diagnosis .
Exacerbat ion of a chronic or intermittent pre -existing condit ion including eit her an increase 
in frequency and/or intensit y of the condit ion.
New condit ions detected or diagnosed after study intervent ion administration even though it 
may have been present before the start of the study.
Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected drug -drug interaction.
Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study  intervent ion 
or a conco mitant medicat ion. Overdose, as a verbatim term (as reported by the invest igator), 
shoul d not be reported as an AE/SAE unless it is an intent ional overdose taken with possible 
suicidal/self-harming intent. Such overdoses should be reported regardl ess of sequelae and 
shoul d specify "intent ional overdose" as the verbatim term
Events NOT Meeting the AE Definition
Medical or surgical procedure (eg, endoscopy , appendectomy): the condi tion that leads to 
the procedure is the AE.
Situations in which an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or 
convenience admissio n to a hospital).
DEFINITION OF SAE
If an event i s not an AE per definit ion above, then it cannot be an SAE even if serious condi tions 
are met.

SERIOUS ADVERSE EVEN TS
Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any 
dose:
Results in death
Is life-threatening (defined as an event in which the participant was at ri sk of  death at the time 
of the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically mi ght have caused death if it were 
more severe)
Requi res inpat ient hospitalization or causes prolongation of exist ing hospi talizat ion (see NOTE 
below)
NOTE: 
The fo llowing hospi talizati ons are not consi dered SAEs in BMS clinical studies: 
a visit to the emergency  room or other hospi tal departm ent < 24 hours, that does not resul t 
in admissio n (unless considered an important medical or life -threatening event)
elective surgery, planned prior to signing consent
admissio ns as per protocol for a planned medical/su rgical procedure
routi ne health assessment requiring admissi on for baseline/trending of health status (e.g., 
routi ne col onoscopy )
medical/surgical admissio n other than to remedy ill healt h and planned prior to entry into 
the study . Appropri ate docum entati on is requi red in these cases
admissio n encountered for another life circumstance that carries no bearing on healt h status 
and requi res no medical/surgical interventi on (e.g., lack of housing, economic inadequacy, 
caregiver respite, family circu mstances, administrative reason)
admissio n for administration of anticancer therapy in the absence of any other SAEs (applies 
to oncology  protocol s)
Results in persistent or significant disabilit y/incapacit y
Is a congenital ano maly/birth defect
Is an important m edical event (defined as a medical event(s) that m ay not be immediately life-
threatening or resul t in death or hospi talizat ion but, based upon appropriate medical and 
scientific judgment, may jeopardi ze the participant or may require intervent ion [e.g., medical, 
surgi cal] to prevent one of the other seri ous outcomes listed in the definit ion above.) Examples 
of such events include, but are not limited to, intensive treatm ent in an emergency  room or at 
home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsio ns that do not resul t in 
hospi talizati on.) Potenti al drug induced liver injury  (DILI) is also considered an important 
medical event. (See Section 9.2.7 for the definit ion of potenti al DILI.) 
Pregnancy and potenti al drug induced liver injury (DILI) must follow the same transmissio n timing 
and processes to BMS as used for SAEs (see section 9.2.5 for reporting pregnancies).

Any co mponent of a study  endpoint that i s considered related to study  therapy  should be reported 
as SAE (e.g., death is anendpo int, if death occurred due to anaphylaxis, anaphylaxis must be 
reported).
EVALUATING AES AND S AES
Assessment of Causality
The invest igator i s obligated to assess the rel ationship between study  intervent ion and each 
occurrence of each AE/SAE.
A “reas onable possibilit y” of a relationship conveys that there are facts, evidence, and/or 
argum ents to suggest a causal relationship, rather than a relat ionship cannot be rul ed out.
The invest igator will use clinical judgment to determine the relat ionship.
Alternative causes, such as underlying disease(s), concomitant therapy , and other risk 
factors, as well as the temporal relat ionship of the event to study intervent ion administratio n 
will be considered and invest igated.
The invest igator will also consult the Investigator’s Brochure (IB) and/or Product 
Inform ation, for marketed products, in his/her assessment.
For each AE/SAE, the invest igator mustdocument in the medical notes that he/she has 
reviewed the AE/SAE and has provided an assessment of causalit y.
There may be situations in which an SAE has occurred and the invest igator has minima l 
inform ation to include in the init ial report to Sponsor. However, it is very  important that the 
investigator always make an assessment of causalit y for every event before the initial 
transmissio n of the SAE data to Sponsor.
The invest igator may change his/her opinio n of causalit y in light of follow-up informat ion 
and send a SAE fo llow-up report wi th the updated causalit y assessment.
The causalit y assessment is one of the criteria used when determining regul atory  reporting 
requi rements.
Follow -up of AEs and SAEs
If only limited informat ion is initially available, follow-up reports are requi red. (Note: Foll ow-
up SAE reports must include the same invest igator term(s) init ially reported.) 
If an ongoing SAE changes in its intensit y or relationship to study  treatm entor if new 
inform ation beco mes available, the SAE report must be updated and submitted within 24 hours 
to BMS (or designee) using the same procedure used for transmitt ing the init ial SAE report.
All SAEs must be fo llowed to resol ution or stabilization.

REPORTING OF SAES TO SPONSOR OR DESIGNEE
SAEs, whether related or not related to study  treatment, and pregnancies must be reported 
to BMS (or designee) immediately wit hin 24 hours of awareness of the event.
SAEs m ust be recorded on the SAE Report Form.
The r equired m ethod for SAE data reporting is through the eCRF.

APPENDIX 4 WOMEN OF CHILDBEARIN G POTENTIAL DEFINITI ONS AND 
METHODS OF CONTRACEP TION
DEFINITIONS
Woman of Childbearing Potential (WOCBP)
A woman is considered fertile following menarche and until becoming post-menopausal unless 
perm anent ly sterile. Perm anent sterilizat ion methods include hysterectomy, bilateral 
salpingectomy , and bilateral  oophorectomy.
Women in the following categories are not considered WOCBP
Prem enarchal
Prem enopausal  female wi th 1 of the f ollowing:
Docum ented hysterectomy
Docum ented bilateral  salpingectomy
Docum ented bilateral  oophorectomy
Note: Docum entati on can come from the site personnel’s review of the partici pant’s medica l 
records, med ical examinat ion, or m edical history  interview.
Postmenopausal  female
A postm enopausal  state is defined as 12 months of amenorrhea in a wom an over age 
45years in the absence of other biological or physi ological causes. In addition, females 
under the age of 55 years must have a serum  follicle stimulat ing horm one, (FSH) level 
> 40 mIU/mL to confirm menopause.
Note: Females treated with horm one replacement therapy, (HRT) are likely to have artificially 
suppressed FSH levels and may require a washout period in order to obtain a physi ologic FSH 
level. The durati on of the washout period is a function of the type of HRT used. The durati on of 
the washout period below are suggested guidelines and the invest igators should use their 
judgement in checking serum FSH le vels. 
1 week minimum for vaginal hormonal products (rings, creams, gels)
4 week minimum for transdermal products
8 week minimum for oral products
Other parenteral products may requi re washout periods as long as 6 months. If the serum  FSH 
level is > 40 mIU/ml at any time during the washout period, the wom an can be considered 
postm enopausal.
CONTRACEPTION GUIDAN CE FOR FEMALE PARTIC IPANTS OF CHILD BEAR ING 
POTENTIAL
Any one of the approved methods of contraceptio n (highly effect ive and/or less than highly 
effective) listed below is required during study duration and for 115 days after treatment has been 
discontinued.

Highly Effective Methods That Are User Independent
Implantable progestogen -only hormonal contracepti on associated with inhibit ion of 
ovulation b
Intrauterine device (IUD)c
Intrauterine hormone -releasing system (IUS)c
Bilateral tubal occlusio n
Vasectomized partner 
A vasectomized partner is a highly effective contraception method provided that the partner 
is the sole male sexual partner of the WOCBP and the absence of sperm has been confirmed. 
If not, an additional highly effective method of contraception should be u sed. 
Sexual abstinence
Sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if defined as refraining from 
heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the study treatment. 
The reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the duration of the 
study and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the participant.
It is not necessary to use any other method of contraception when complete abstinence is 
elected. 
WOCBP participants who choose complete abstinence must continue to have pregnancy 
tests, as specified in Section 2. 
Acceptable alternate methods of highly effective contraception must be discussed in the 
event that the WOCBP participants chooses to forego complete abst inence

NOTES: 
aTypical use failure rates may  differ from those when used consistently  and correctly . Use should be consistent 
with local regulations regarding the use of contraceptive methods for participants participating in clinical studies. 
bHormonal contraception may be susceptible to interaction with the study treatment, which may reduce the 
efficacy of the contraceptive method.  Hormonal contraception is permissible only when there is sufficient 
evidence that the IMP and other study medications will not alter hormonal exposures such that contraception 
would be ineffective or result in increased exposures that could be potentially hazardous.  In this case, alternative 
methods of contraception should be utilized. 
cIntrauterine devices and intrauterine hormone relea sing sy stems are acceptable methods of contraception in the 
absence of definitive drug interaction studies when hormone exposures from intrauterine devices do not alter 
contraception effectiveness
Less Than Highly Effective Contraceptive Methods That Ar e User Dependent 
Failure rate of >1% per year w hen used consistently and correctly.
Male or female condom  with or without spermicide.  Male and female condo ms cannot be 
used simultaneously
Diaphragm  with spermicide
Cervical cap wit h spermicide
Vaginal Sponge wi th spermicide
Progestogen -only oral hormonal contracepti on, where inhibit ion of ovulat ion is not the 
primary  mechanism o f action
Unacceptable Methods of Contraception
Periodic abst inence (calendar, symptothermal, post -ovulation methods)
Withdraw al (coitus interruptus).
Spermicide only
Lactati on amenorrhea m ethod (LAM)

APPENDIX 5 DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA FOR DRUG AND ALCOHOL ABUSE
The fo llowing i s taken from  DSM -IV:
Diagnostic Cri teria for Psychoactive S ubstance Dependence
A maladapt ive pattern of substance use, leading to clinically significant impairment or distress as 
manifested by  3 (or m ore) of the fo llowing, occurring at any  time in the same 12 -month peri od:
1.Tolerance, as defined by eit her of the fo llowing:
a)A need for markedly increased amounts of the substance to achieve intoxicat ion or desired 
effect,
b)Markedly diminished effect with continued use o f the sam e am ount of  the substance.
2.Withdrawal, as manifested by either of the fo llowing:
a)The characte ristic withdrawal syndro me for the substance,
b)The same (or closely related) substance is taken to relieve or avoid wit hdrawal symptoms.
3.The substance is o ften taken in larger amounts or over a longer period than was intended.
4.There i s a persistent desire o r unsuccessful efforts to cut down or control substance use.
5.A great deal of time is spent in activit ies necessary to obtain the substance (eg,visiting mult iple 
doctors or driving long distances), use the substance (eg,chain -smoking) or recover from its 
effects.
6.Important social, occupati onal or recreational activities are given up or reduced because of 
substance use.
7.The substance use is cont inued despite knowledge of having a persistent or recurring physical 
or psychological problem  that is likely  to have been caused or exacerbated by the substance 
(eg, current cocaine use despite recogni tion of cocaine -induced depressio n, or continued 
drinking despite recognit ion that an ulcer was made worse by alcoho l consumpt ion.)
Criteria for Severi ty of Psychoact ive Substance Dependence:
Mild:  Few, if any, symptoms in excess of those required to make the diagnosis, and the symptoms 
resul t in no m ore than mild impairment in occupational functioning or in usual social act ivities or 
relationships wit h others.
Modera te:  Symptom s or f unctional impairment between “mild” and “severe”.
Severe:  Many symptom s in excess of those required to make the diagnosis, and the symptom s 
markedly interfere with occupational funct ioning or with usual social activities or relationships
with others.
In Parti al Remissi on:  During the past six months, some use of the substance and some symptoms 
of dependence.
In Full Remissi on:  During the past six months, either no use of the substance, or use of the 
substance and no symptoms of dependenc e.

househo ld).
2.Recurrent substance use in situations in which it is physically  hazardous (eg,driving an 
autom obile or operating a machine when impaired by  substance use).
3.Recurrent substance -related legal problems (eg, arrests forsubstance -related disorderly 
conduct).
4.Continued substance use despite having persistent or recurrent social or interpersonal

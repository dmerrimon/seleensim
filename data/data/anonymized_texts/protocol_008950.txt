2.0 INTRODUCTION  
 
2.1 Background  
 
Although c urrent Department of Health and Human Services ( DHHS ) guidelines 
recommend either efavirenz (EFV)  or a ritonavir -boosted protease -inhibitor (PI ) in 
combination with two nucleoside reverse trans criptase inhibitors (NRTIs)  as initial 
therapy of treatment -naïve patients [1] , combinations of EFV  + two NRTIs have 
been preferred by most practitioners. Specifically, the fixed dose combination of 
EFV/TDF/FTC  is currently one the most prescribed regimen used in therapy -naïve 
patients. However, certain treatment -limiting toxicities have been associated w ith 
EFV and TDF -based therapy, including: renal [2] , CD4 + T-cell decline [3] , central 
nervous system  [4] and lipatrophy [5] . Recently, new drug classes have been 
developed and potential new NRTI and NNRTI -sparing treatment options may be 
considered for treatment- naïve patients.  
 
The combination of LPV/r + RAL  offers potential therapeutic  advantages over 
current standard -of-care therapy that will be evaluated with the proposed study:

1. Antiviral Pote ncy: Individually , LPV/r and RAL  are potent antiretrovirals 
(ARVs) that act on distinct steps in viral replication. T he combination of a  late 
(i.e. LPV/r) and mid -cycle (i.e. RAL ) viral target inhibitor could more 
efficien tly stop viral replication from ce ll reservoirs  leading  to a more rapid 
early plasma viral decay rate than the combination of EFV/TDF/ FTC whic h 
inhibits a common viral replication step.  
 
2.  Immune Recovery : Faster viral decay dynamics could result in greater phase 1 
(baseline to week 12) CD4+ T-cell recovery.  In addition , the inclusion of LPV/r 
may further decrease activation -induced apoptosis and enhance subsequent 
phase 2 (week 12 to 48) T-cell regeneration.   
 
 
2.1.1   Lopinavir/ ritonavir ( Kaletra®, LPV/r)  
 
LPV is a potent inhibitor of HIV -1 protease.  When coformulated with LPV, 
ritonavir  inhibits the CYP3A -mediated metabolism of LPV, thereby 
providing increased plasma levels of LPV /r.  LPV/r  has been evaluated and 
approved by the FDA for use in combination with other ARV agents for the  
treatm ent of HIV -1 infection.  LPV/r  twice daily is one o f the preferred PI in 
treatment -naïve HIV -infected patients in the DHHS HIV treatment guideline 
for adults and adolescents (DHHS 1- 08).  
 
2.1.1.1 Efficacy  
 
The efficacy of LPV/r  has been studied in ARV -naïve and ARV -
experienced HIV -1 infected patients. The M97- 720 study, a phase II study 
of LPV/r in combination with NRTIs in ARV - naïve HIV -1-infected 
subjects, was a randomized, dose -blinded, multicenter trial with two groups 
of subjects enrolled [6] .  Group I subjects (n=32) were randomly assigned to 
200 mg LPV/100 mg  RTV Q12H or 400 mg LPV/100 mg RTV Q12H 
monotherapy. On day 22, all subjects added stavudine (d4T) and lamivudine 
(3TC).  Group II subjects (n=70) were randomly assigned to 400 mg 
LPV/100 mg RTV Q12H or 400 mg LPV/200 mg RTV Q12H and received 
d4T and 3TC beginning on day 1. After 48 weeks, all subjects converted to 
open- labeled LPV/r 400mg/100mg BID dosing. At year 6, d4T / 3TC was 
substituted with TDF  in combination with LPV/r in 37 subjects.  Similar 
efficacy was observed across all dosing groups. However , a trend towards 
higher lipid levels and increased rates of gastrointestinal adverse events was 
seen in the highest dose group, 400 mg LPV/200 mg RTV.  Based on a 
review of this and other phase I/II data, a dose of 400 mg LPV with 100 mg 
RTV BID was selected for development.  After week 48, all subjects were 
converted to this dose.  
 
  CCTG 589 
  Protocol version 1.0 
   June 6, 2008  
 10 At week 360 (7 year data), by intent -to-treat missing=failure (ITT M=F) 
analysis, 61% of all participants had HIV -1 RNA <400 copies/mL, while the 
corresponding on- treatment (OT ) analysis showed 98% suppressed to this 
level.  By ITT M=F analysis, 59% of study subjects had HIV -1 RNA <50 
copies/mL (OT: 95%). During 7 years of treatment with LPV/r, there were 
18 subjects that met the criteria for loss of virologic response, and 11 
participants had at least one “blip” after week 24.  Resistance tests were 
performed on 29 subjects.  In 19 individuals with available results, no LPV 
or d4T resistance was observed.  Four individuals demonstrated 3TC 
resistance with six demonstrating a new  secondary mutation/ polymorphism 
in protease at rebound, but phenotypic LPV susceptibility was not affected.  
 
In a phase III M98 -863 study, the safety and efficacy of LPV/r versus 
nelfinavir (NFV) both in combination with d4T and 3TC was evaluated in 
ARV- naïve subjects. The M98- 863 study was a randomized, double -blind, 
multicenter, international trial [6] . Overall, 326 subjects were assigned to the 
LPV/r group and 327 to the NFV group. The superior antiviral activity of 
LPV/r was demonstrated by the analysis of the proportion of subjects 
achieving a plasma HIV -1 RN A below 400 copies/mL at week 48 (75% vs. 
63% respectively, ITT, p<0.001) and the analysis of the proportion of 
subjects achieving a plasma HIV -1 RNA below 50 copies/mL at week 48 
(67% vs. 52% respectively, ITT, p<0.001).  In the analysis of the time to 
loss of virologic response through week 48, superior antiviral activity of 
LPV/r was also demonstrated (p<0.001, Cox proportional hazards model) 
with 84% of LPV/r and 66% of NFV -treated subjects maintaining virologic 
suppression.  Samples from 51 (69%) LPV/r -treated and 96 (78%) NFV -
treated subjects could be amplified for resistance testing.  No primary 
protease mutations were detected in the rebound sample from any of the 
LPV/r -treated subjects through week 108.  In contrast, new protease 
mutations developed in 43 of 96 samples from NFV -treated subjects, and PI 
resistance was confirmed by phenotypic analysis.  Resistance to 3TC and 
d4T was also significantly higher in NFV - than LPV/r -treated subjects.  
 
2.1.1.2 Impact on CD4+ T -cell Recovery  
 
In both of these trials i n ARV-  naïve patients, LPV/r led to a significant 
recovery of CD4 cells. In the M97- 720 study, t he mean increase in CD4+ T -
cell counts between baseline and week 360 was 501 cells/mm3.  In the M98 -
863 study, LPV/r led to a similar CD4 + T-cell cell recovery in the LPV/r 
group than in the NFV group. The  mean change in CD4+ T -cell count at 
week 48 was 207 cells/mm3 for the LPV/r- treated group and 195 cells/mm3 
for the NFV -treated  group.

 11 2.1.1.3 Safety and Tolerability  
 
LPV/r  is generally well tolerated. In the M97 -720 study, 38 subjects 
discontinued at or prior to week 360.  Reasons for discontinuation probably 
or possibly due to study drugs include: AST/ALT increases ( n=2), diarrhea 
(n=1), liver pain/enlargement, fatty deposits ( n=1), arthralgia ( n=1), elevated 
lipids (n=2), fat redistribution ( n=5), and death of unknown cause ( n=1) (10 
days after thoracic spinal surgery with perioperative myocardial infarction).  
The most frequent adverse events of moderate or severe intensity and 
probable, possible, or unknown rel ationship to LPV/r in both M97- 720 
treatment groups were diarrhea (28%), nausea (16%), lipodystrophy (12%), 
abdominal pain (11%). The most frequent Grade ≥ 3 laboratory 
abnormalities were cholesterol >300 mg/dL (27%), triglycerides >750 
mg/dL (29%), and AST /ALT >5 x ULN (11%).   
 
The safety and tolerability of LPV/r and NFV were also assessed in the 
M98- 863 study.  In this study, only 3% of subjects in the LPV/r treatment 
group and 4% of the subjects in the NFV group discontinued  therapy at or 
before week 48 due to study drug- related adverse events .  Diarrhea and 
nausea were the most frequently reported adverse events  in both treatment 
groups.  However, study drug interruptions and discontinuations related to 
diarrhea or nausea were infrequent, occurring in l ess than 2% of subjects in 
either treatment group.  Adverse events  consistent with body fat 
composition changes were reported in 5% of LPV/r and 6% of NFV -treated 
subjects through week 48.  Five individuals receiving LPV/r and three NFV 
died.  One death due to pancreatitis was considered possibly related to 
LPV/r; with the person also having lactic acidosis.  Clinically significant 
laboratory abnormalities were infrequent in both treatment groups.  Grade 3 
or 4 elevations of cholesterol were noted in 9% of LPV/r -treated and 5% of 
NFV -treated subjects.  Grade 3 or 4 triglyceride elevations were noted more 
frequently in LPV - than NLF -treated subjects (9% vs. 1%, respectively, p 
<0.001). However, Grade 3 or 4 elevations of lipids were generally 
intermittent with the majority of subjects who experienced such elevations 
not having persistent elevations above Grade 2.  No subjects discontinued 
the study due to lipid elevations. 
 
2.1.1.4 Drug Interactions and Special Populations  
 
 
LPV is metabolized by CYP3A. Drugs that ind uce CYP3A activity are 
expected to increase the clearance of LPV resulting in lower plasma levels 
while those that inhibit CYP3A are expected to increase plasma levels of 
LPV (see Section 5.4 Concomitant Medications).  
 
LPV/r has a pregnancy category C rati ng.

2.1.2 Raltegravir ( Isentress® , RAL ) 
 
RAL is the first FDA approved agent in the class of integrase inhibitors. 
RAL targets the HIV -1 integrase enzyme which is required for viral 
replication. HIV -1 encoded integrase catalyzes the insertion of the HI V-1 
DNA into the genome of the host cell. Raltegravir acts at the step of strand 
transfer and prevents transfer of HIV DNA into the host DNA.  
 
2.1.2.1 Efficacy  
 
RAL has been evaluated in several clinical trials in ARV - naïve and – 
experienced HIV -1 infected patien ts. The protocol 004 is a multicenter, 
double -blinded, randomized 2- part, dose ranging study. In part I, RAL was 
given as one of four different doses (100mg, 200mg, 400mg, 600mg BID) as 
monotherapy to 35 patients for 10 days. In part II, RAL was given as o ne of 
four different doses and compared to EFV both in combination with TDF  + 
3TC for 48 weeks. After 48 weeks, participants who received RAL at 
different doses, were continued at a RAL dos e of 400mg BID combined 
with TDF /3TC and compared with the group re ceiving EFV/TDF /3TC.  
RAL was found efficacious when given as monotherapy in all evaluated 
doses with a mean decrease of HIV RNA from baseline to day 10 of 1.7 – 
2.2 log 10 copies/mL (Part I) [7] . The 48 week analysis of part II included 
198 patients, 160 participants receiving RAL and 38 EFV [8] . At weeks 2, 4, 
and 8, the proportion of patients achieving an HIV -1 RNA level <50 
copie s/mL was grea ter in each of the RAL treated  groups than in the EFV 
group. By week 24, all treatment groups appeared similar, with plasma HIV -
1 RNA levels <400 copies/mL in 85% -  98% of subjects in the RAL group 
and 95% in the EFV group and <50 copies/mL in  85 - 95% of patients of 
subjects in the RAL groups and 92% in the EFV group. These viral load 
reductions were maintained through week 48 in 85% to 98% of patients and 
in 83% to 88% of patients, respectively. In a time -to-event analysis, patients 
receiving  RAL at any dose achieved an HIV -1 RNA level < 50 copies/mL 
earlier than patients receiving EFV (log -rank test p<0.05).  Five (3%) 
patients on RAL and 1 (3%) on EFV experienced virologic failure before 
week 48. In two patients with virologic failure on RAL , the N155H 
mutation was detected in the HIV -1 integrase region. NNRTI and NRTI 
mutations (including the K65R mutation) were found in the one patient 
failing in the EFV group.   
 
Two phase III randomized controlled trials of treatment -experienced 
subjects have also been reported.  These studies, BENCHMRK 1 and 2 were 
conducted in Europe, Asia/Pacific, Peru, and North and South America  [9, 
10]. In these studies, triple class resistant subjects were randomized 2:1 to 
RAL 400 mg BID or placebo plus optimized background therapy (OBT).

 13 Results showed that 64% and 34% of subje cts in the RAL and placebo arms, 
respectively, had plasma HIV -1 RNA < 50 copies/mL at 48 weeks.  
A cross -sectional analysis of integrase resistance data from the 
BENCHMRK- 1 and 2 studies have been presented. Mutations in the 
integrase region of HIV pol at Q148 or N155 in combination with at least 
one other mutation were associated with virological failure.  
 
2.1.2.2 CD4 + T-cell Recovery  
 
The mean increase in CD4 + T-cell count in Study 004 ranged from 70- 104 
cells/mm3 across all treatment groups and continued to inc rease through 
week 32. The mean CD4+ T -cell increase was comparable between the 
different RAL  groups and EFV.  
 
2.1.2.3 Safety and Tolerability  
 
RAL was overall well tolerated. In the study 004, there were overall fewer 
drug related clinical adverse event s in the RAL group than in the EFV group 
(p=0.04 for 100mg , 400mg and p=0.07 for 200mg RAL). The most frequent 
drug related adverse events were nausea, headache, dizziness. Serious 
adverse event occurred in 6% in the RAL group experienced and 5% in the 
EFV group. None of the serious adverse events were considered drug related 
or led to treatment discontinuation.  
 
In the BENCHMRK trials, there was overall no difference in the clinical or 
laboratory toxicity between those receiving OBT with RAL than with 
placebo.  Dr ug-related clinical AEs were reported in > 5% of subjects 
receiving RAL in BENCHMRK 1 for diarrhea (6.9%), with this occurring in 
14.4% of controls.  In BENCHMRK 2 clinical AEs occurring in > 5% of 
RAL -treated subjects included diarrhea (13.9% versus 10.1% of controls), 
nausea (9.6% versus 9.2% ), fatigue (5.2% versus 2.5%) and headache 
(8.7% versus 5.0%). Laboratory abnormalities reported in >  5% of the RAL -
treated subjects in BENCHMRK 1 included LDL >190 mg/dL (7.8% versus 
6.4%), triglycerides >750 mg/dL (7.7% versus 2.5%), and alanine 
aminotransferase (ALT) >5.1 times ULN (6.5% versus 4.2%).  In contrast, 
for BENCHMRK 2 such laboratory abnormalities were only seen at > 5% of 
individuals for triglycerides >750 mg/dL (10.6% versus 7.6%) and c reatine 
kinase > 10  times ULN (6% versus 4.2%).

2.1.3   Pharmacokinetic Compatibility of Lopinavir/ritonavir and Raltegravir  
 
  CCTG 589 
  Protocol version 1.0 
   June 6, 2008  
 14 Data about potential pharmacokinetic interaction s between LPV/r and RAL 
are available from healthy volunteer studies . In a PK study of 15 healthy 
volunteers RAL (400 mg twice -daily) and LPV/r (400/100 mg twice -daily) 
were given each as monotherapy followed by a combination of both drugs. 
The plasma concentrations of each drug were measured during monotherapy 
and while given in combination. 
 
The LPV  concentration was not influenced by the addition of RAL. 
However, RAL trough concentrations were 30% lower when LPV/r was 
given in combination (12 hour concentration of 49.4 ng/mL when given as 
monotherapy and 34.3.ng/mL when given in combination with LPV/r), but 
still above the estimated IC 95 for wild -type virus of 15ng/mL. Additionally, 
elimination half -life of RAL was shortened from 5.9 hours when given as 
monotherapy to 3.6 hours when given in combination with LPV/r.  In 12 out 
of 13 participants who completed the study, the trough level remained above 
the estimated 95% inhibitory concentration of RAL of 14.6 ng/mL. In one 
participant, the trough level was measured below the 95% inhibitory 
concentration of RAL. Of note, in part 1 of study 004 [7] , RAL was given as 
one of four different doses (100mg, 200mg, 400mg, 600mg BID) as 
monotherapy to 35 patients for 10 days. All four arms had similar 
magnitudes of HIV viral decay, suggesting that RAL is sufficiently potent 
even at lower concentrations. The authors do not recommend an y dose 
adjustment when using RAL in combination with LPV/r [11] . 
 
2.1.4 Atripla® ( EFV/TDF/FTC ) 
 
Atripla ® is fixed dose combination of EFV, TDF and FTC . Atripla® has 
been approved by the FDA in July 2006 for the treatment of HIV -1 infection 
in adults.  Atripla® is one of the preferred NNRTI containing  regimen s for 
treatment -naïve HIV -infected patients in th e DHHS HIV treatment guideline 
for ad ults and adolescents [1] .  
 
2.1.4.1 Efficacy  
 
Several prospective clinical trials have demonstrated that EFV -based 
therapy is as effe ctive or more effective than the drugs it has been compared 
with, including indinavir (IDV), nelfinavir (NFV), nevirapine (NVP), 
atazanavir ( ATV) , Triz ivir® (fixed dose ZDV/3TC/ABC) [12- 14].  For 
example, in a randomized, 48 week, open label study, in ARV –naïve HIV -1 
Infected patients, more subjects randomized to efavirenz + AZT + 3TC  had 
a HIV -1 RNA < 400copies/ml than subjects assigned to Indinavir + 
zidovudine + lamivudine (70% versus 48% ITT, p<0.05) or efavirenz + 
indinavir (70% versus 53% ITT, p<0.05) [14] . 
 
A randomized, double blinded study comparing EFV  versus ATV, both 
combined with AZT and 3TC showed no differences in HIV -1 RNA levels 
  CCTG 589 
  Protocol version 1.0 
   June 6, 2008  
 15 after 48 weeks (70% for ATV versus 64%  for EFV ) [12] . The ACTG 5095 
study compared a triple NRTI regimen ( ZDV +3TC+ ABC ) versus two EFV  
based regimens (one in comniation ZDV + 3TC and a second combination 
with ZDV+3TC+ABC) [13] . The EFV  containing treatment groups had a 
much higher rate of HIV -1 viral suppression (61% for the triple NRTI arm 
and 89% for the combined EFV arms (p< <0.001 ). Twenty one percent of 
subjects in the triple NRTI arm failed this regimen which led to the 
discontinuation of this arm. 
 
Study 934 is  a phase III, randomized, open- label, multicenter study designed 
to compare EFV with either TDF 300 mg + FTC 200 mg QD or ZDV 300 
mg + 3TC 150 mg BID as fixed- dose combination Combivir® [15] . After 
144 weeks of treatment, 71% of subjects in the EFV  + TDF + 3TC  had HIV -
1 viral  load < 400 copies/mL in comparison to 58% of subjects in the EFV  + 
ZDV  + 3TC  group (n=0.004 using the time to loss of virologic response 
algorithm). In general, resistance to an EFV -based regimen can developed 
within weeks when plasma HIV -1 RNA levels are not suppressed to below 
the assay limits of quantification. Mutation at codon 103 develops  most 
often with the use of EFV  which is associated with cross -resistance to many  
available NNRTIs.  
 
2.1.4.2 CD4 + T-cell recovery  
 
In the study 934, the mean increase of CD4 cell from baseline to week 144 
was 312 cells/mL in the EFV/TDF/FTC group and 271 cell/mL in the 
efavirenz / c ombivir group. The mean CD4 cell increase was 176 cell/mm3 
versus 160 cell/mm3 for ATZ r versus EFV  [12] and 201, 185, 180 cell/mm3 
for EFV  + ZDV +3TC, EFV + IDV and IDV + AZT+3TC  [14] . 
 
2.1.4.3 Safety and Tolerability  
 
The most common side effects of EFV are central nervous  system (CNS) 
symptoms and rash. Fifty -three percent of subjects receiving EFV reported 
CNS symptoms, including but not limited to dizziness, impaired 
concentration, somnolence, abnormal dreams, and insomnia. Symptoms 
usually begin during the first or second day of therapy and generally resolve 
after 2 to 4 weeks of therapy. In clinical trials, 2.1% of EFV -treated subjects 
discontinued therapy because of CNS side effects.   There have been reports 
(approximately 1 or 2 per thousand EFV -treated patients) of d elusions and 
aberrant behavior, predominantly in those with a history of mental illness or 
substance abuse. Severe acute depression (including suicidal 
ideation/attempts) has also been infrequently reported in both EFV -treated 
(0.9%) and control -treated (0 .5%) subjects.  Subjects who experience these 
symptoms should contact their doctor immediately to assess the possibility 
that the symptoms may be related to EFV.  
 
  CCTG 589 
  Protocol version 1.0 
   June 6, 2008  
 16 In controlled clinical trials, 26% (266/1008) of subjects treated with EFV 
600 mg QD experienced new onset skin rash compared with 17% (111/635) 
of subjects treated in control groups (see the Sustiva® package insert). Rash 
associated with blistering, moist desquamation, or ulceration occurred in 
0.9% (9/1008) of subjects treated with EFV. Among approximately 2200 
treated subjects in all studies and expanded access, the incidence of Grade 4 
rash (e.g., erythema multiforme and Stevens -Johnson syndrome) was 0.14%. 
The median time to onset of rash in adults was 11 days, and the median 
duration was 16 days. The discontinuation rate for rash in clinical trials was 
1.7% (17/1008). EFV should be discontinued in subjects developing severe 
rash associated with blistering, desquamation, mucosal involvement, or 
fever; milder rashes often resolve with continued dosing, with 
antihistamines or transient corticosteroids  given for symptomatic relief.  
 
The most common adverse events  in patients receiving TDF with other 
ARV therapy in clinical trials were mild to moderate gastrointestinal events, 
such as nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, and flatulence. Less than 1% of patients 
discontinued participation in the clinical studies  because of gastrointestinal 
adverse events . Laboratory abnormalities observed in these studies occurred 
with similar frequency in the TDF and placebo -treated groups.  
 
In rare cases, hypophosphatemia, proteinuria, glycosuria, and reduced 
creatinine clearance have been seen, and several cases of renal tubular injury 
have been reported.  In a retrospective review, the rate of TDF 
discontinuation due to increased creatinine was evaluated in a review of a 
clinical database which included drug treatment, demographic, and 
laboratory data of 563 HIV -1-infected subjects who had been treated with 
TDF.  Of these subjects, 11 (2%) had discontinued TDF due to elevat ed 
creatinine after a median of 4 months (range 2 -9); of the 9 for whom renal 
biopsy was available, all showed evidence of acute tubular injury.  Lactic 
acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases have 
been reported with the use of nucleoside analogues alone or in combination, 
including TDF, and other ARVs.   
 
2.1.4.4 Drug Interactions and Special Populations  
 
The U.S. FDA use -in-pregnancy category for EFV has been changed from 
Category C (Risk of Fetal Harm Cannot Be Ruled Out) t o Category D 
(Positive Evidence of Fe tal Risk).  This change is a result of four 
retrospective reports of neural tube defects in infants born to women with 
first trimester exposure to EFV, including three cases of meningomyelocele 
and one of Dandy Walker s yndrome.  As EFV may cause fetal harm when 
administered during the first trimester to a pregnant woman, pregnancy 
should be a voided in women receiving EFV.  Women of reproductive 
potential should be counseled on the possible risks associated with 
pregnancy . Women should be instructed not t o breast -feed while taking 
  CCTG 589 
  Protocol version 1.0 
   June 6, 2008  
 17 EFV.  If a woman becomes pregnant while taking EFV during the first 
trimester of pregnancy, she should be apprised of t he potential harm to the 
fetus.

2.2    Rationale    
 
2.2.1 Antiviral and Metabolic Outcomes   
 
Raltegravir is an HIV -1 integrase inhibitor that has been shown to be 
efficacious, safe and well -tolerated [9, 10, 16, 17] . Studie s of early viral 
decay kinetics, a surrogate measure of overall regimen potency and 
predictor of long -term viral suppression [18] , demonstrate that  RAL  has 
viral decay rates that exceed those observed with PIs, NNRTIs or N RTIs 
[7]. In a dose -finding, comparative study of RAL  (four dose arms: 100 mg 
to 600 mg daily) vs. EFV in combination with 2 NRTIs, a similar proportion 
of patients achiev ed plasma HIV -1 RNA less t han 50 copies/mL at week 24 
(RAL  arms: 85 – 95% vs. EFV:  92% ). These reductions in viral load 
persisted through 48 weeks of therapy with no significant difference in the 
long-term rates of viral suppression between the two arms. One explanation 
for these faster early viral decay rates is that already reverse transcribed pre-
integration complexes can proceed through the replication cycle and 
generate RNA containing virions for the lifetime of the infected cell while 
RAL  will block such complexes from integrating and generating RNA 
containing virions. Importantly, total cholesterol, low -density lipoprotein 
and triglyceride levels were relatively  unchanged in the RAL  groups. By 
contrast, all three of these lipid markers increased from baseline in the 
efavirenz subjects. Although la rge phase 3 trials comparing RAL - vs. EFV -
based regimens in treatment -naïve patients are not yet available, preliminar y 
data with 48 weeks of follow -up demonstrate a comparable deg ree of 
antiviral efficacy of RAL -based therapy compared with standard of care 
therapy with EFV -based regimens.  
 
Comparisons between LPV/r - and EFV -based regimens have been less 
clear -cut. In one study, virologic response was similar between EFV  and 
LPV/r  [19] , however a recent ACTG study, A5142 [20] , demonstrated 
significantly better viral control r ates with EFV -based regimens . A5142 is a  
prospective study that randomized 753 treatment -naïve patients to either an 
NRTI -containing regimen of LPV/r  (400/100 mg twice -daily) or EFV  (600 
mg once -daily) combined with 3TC  and a second NRTI, or a NRTI -sparing  
regimen of LPV/r  (533/133 mg twice -daily) and EFV  (600 mg once -daily) 
for 96 weeks .  The EFV  arm had a greater proportion of subjects with HIV 
RNA levels < 50 copies/ml than the LPV/r  group (89% vs. 77%; P=0.003, 
  CCTG 589 
  Protocol version 1.0 
   June 6, 2008  
 18 respectively).  While median increases from  baseline in total cholesterol 
were similar between nucleoside- containing regimens (33 mg/dL vs. 33 
mg/dL), LPV/r -treated subjects had greater increases in triglycerides than 
those in the efavirenz arm (47 mg/dL vs. 14 mg/dL, P <0.01). In contrast, 
EFV -treated subjects had a higher proportion of protocol -defined 
lipoatrophy than the LPV/r  group (32% vs. 18%, P <0.01) [21] . 
 
2.2.2 Immunologic Benefits  
 
Suboptimal CD4+ T -cell recovery during antiretrovi ral therapy is a common 
clinical dilemma. Several studies have demonstrated greater CD4+ T -cell 
recovery during viral suppression in patients receiving LPV/r -based 
regimens compared to other combination therapies [12, 22- 24].  Although A 
5142 demonstrated  that the EFV arm had a greater proportion of patients 
with plasma HIV RNA levels below 50 copies/mL, both LPV/r -containing 
treatment arms showed significantly higher absolute CD4+ T -cell gains after 
96 weeks than patients receiving EFV (284 cells/mm3 and 268 cells/mm3 vs. 
241 cells/mm3; P=0.01)  [24] . The mechanisms by which PI -based therapies 
may improve CD4+ T cell recovery are poorly understood. Interestingly, 
some PIs have been shown to inhibit lymphocyte apoptosis [25, 26] .  Since 
CD4+ T -cell activation and apoptosis continues despite control of HIV -1 
replication, PI -based regimens may improve T cell survival, and long term 
T-cell reconstitution.  In addition, faster viral decay rates have been 
associated with more robust early CD4+ T -cell r ecovery [27] . Potentially, 
the addition of RAL  may result in a more rapid viral clearance and 
consequently improved early CD4 + T-cell recovery than currently 
recommended EFV -based regimens . 
 
2.2.3 Justification for an NRTI -sparing regimen  
 
NRTIs in combination with PIs / NNRTIs have been the backbone  of potent 
antiretroviral drug combinations  since the  introduction of HAART .  
However,  NRTIs are associated with significant toxicity  such as  
mitochondrial toxicity, lipoatrophy and others.  Therefore, novel, NRTI -
sparing  and potent  antiretroviral combinations are appealing. The feasibility 
using NRTI -sparing antiret roviral therapies has be en demonstrated  in the 
ACTG 5142 trial which compared LPV/r + EFV with EFV + NRTI s and 
LPV/r + NRTI s [28] .  In this study, the NRTI -sparing arm was as effective 
as the EFV + NRTI arm and superior to the LPV/r + NRTI arm . However, a 
higher rate of laboratory abnormalities, especially  elevated  lipid levels , was 
reported in the LPV + EFV combination and limits its use .  
RAL is a  new and  potent antiretroviral agent . Its ability to reduce HIV viral 
load is comparable to  EFV  with the additional benefit to decrease HIV RNA 
level faster to  < 50 copies/mL  than EFV  [7]. In contrast to EFV, RAL 
showed no adverse effects on cholesterol and triglyceride lipids .  Therefore, 
the combination of RAL + LPV/r is  very appealing  by providing  a potent 
  CCTG 589 
  Protocol version 1.0 
   June 6, 2008  
 19 NRTI sparing ARV regimen and with a lower risk of  worsening  blood lipid  
levels .  Additionally, the high genetic barrier of LPV /r provides protection 
against mutations affecti ng RAL which has a low genetic barrier.  
  
2.2.4 Hypotheses  
 
1. The novel nucleoside -sparing combination of LPV/r  +  
  RAL  will have a faster phase 1 viral decay rate compared to  
  standard -of-care therapy with EFV/TDF/FTC  in antiretroviral- naïve 
 patients.  
 
a. Faste r phase 1 viral decay dynamics will be associated with 
improved long er-term (week 48) viral suppression.  
b. Faster phase 1 viral decay dynamics will be associated with 
accelerated early (Day 0 -14) clearance of cell -associated HIV DNA.  
c. Faster phase 1 viral decay dynamics will be associated with greater  
early (baseline to week 12) CD4 + T-cell recovery.  
 
2. The LPV/r  + RAL  arm will have greater decreases in  
  early (baseline to week 4) CD4/CD8 T -cell immune  activation and 
 apoptosis which will be associated with greater late (week 12 to  
  week 48) CD4 + T-cell recovery.  
 
3. Subjects treated with  LPV/r  + RAL  arm will have smaller  
  changes in total cholesterol and triglycerides from baseline than those  
  receiving  EFV/TDF/FTC .  
 
3.0 STUDY DESIGN    
 
CCTG 589 is a random ized, open- label, 48 -week pilot study comparing the 
efficacy, safety and tolerabilit y of RAL plus LPV/r to EFV/ TDF/FTC in HIV -
infected, treatment naïve subjects (defined as having never received any HIV 
antiretroviral agents in the past) with plasma HIV -1 RNA > 5000 copies/mL and 
CD4+ T -cells > 50 cells/mm3 at or within 90 days of screening.  Additional 
screening safety laboratories must be obtained within 30 days of study entry. Drug 
resistance testing is required prior to entry and can include any available test done 
prior to entry.  Subjects will be ineligible if they have any evidence of drug resistant 
virus in the past or at the time of screening (if never previously tested).  All 
resistance test results should be scanned and uploaded to the online data c ollection 
system for review and approval by the protocol team ant the site’s investigator prior 
to enrollment.  Those who are found to be eligible will be randomized 1:1 to initiate 
either LPV/r (400/100 mg) plus RAL (400mg), both given twice -daily, or fix ed 
dose combination of EFV (600 mg), TDF (300 mg) and FTC (200 mg) given as 
once -daily Atripla® for 48 weeks.  The study will provide LPV/r and RAL, however, 
Atripla® must be provided by prescription.  
 
  CCTG 589 
  Protocol version 1.0 
   June 6, 2008  
 20 Eligible subjects will be HIV -1-infected, at least 18 y ears of age, treatment -naïve 
and have no evidence of drug resistant virus  (per Inclusion Criteria, Section 4.1.)  
detected by any previous resistance test or at screening if not previously performed.  
Subjects must have  CD4+ T -cell counts greater than or eq ual to 50 cells/mm3 and 
screening plasma HIV -1 RNA greater than or equal to 5,000 copies/mL  at or within 
90 days  of study screening . 
 
Fifty subjects will be enrolled over approximately 48 weeks. Subjects will be 
stratified based upon screening  plasma HIV -1 RNA ( greater than or equal to or 
below  100,000 copies/mL) and will be followed for a total of 48 weeks.  Subjects 
will have plasma HIV -1 RNA and CD4+ T -cell count measured at pre- entry and 
entry.  The geometric and arithmetic  means, respectively, of these measurements 
will be used to establish their baseline values.  During the initial 2 -week period, 
subjects will undergo intensive monitoring of viral decay dynamics with plasma 
HIV-1 RNA measured at ba seline and days 2, 7, 10 and 14. C hanges in  CD4+ T -
cells will be measured  from baseline to week 12 (Phase 1) and week 12 to week 48 
(Phase 2).  In addition, extended immune phenotyping for activation, maturation 
and apoptosis markers will be measured on CD4+/CD8+ T -cells obtained from 
baseline, week 4 and week 24. From weeks 2 to 48, subjects will be monitored for 
treatment efficacy, including changes in CD4+ T -cells and plasma HIV -1 RNA 
levels, as well as for safety and tolerability with laboratories for hematology, 
chemistry, fasting lipids and a symptom ques tionnaire.  Serial plasma and PBMCs 
will be stored for future studies.  Genotypic drug resistance testing will be 
performed at screening (test not provided by study) if never performed  in the past as 
well as at the time of virolog ic failure. Virologic failure will be defined as :  
 
• Week 4:  
Confirmed failure to achieve ≤50 copies/ml or, if >50 copies/ml, a 1 log 10 
copies/ml reduction from the baseline level;  
 
• Week 12:  
Confirmed failure to achieve ≤50 copies/ml or, if >50 copies/ml, a 2 log 10 
copies/ml red uction from baseline level;  
OR, if the Week 4 value is >50 copies/ml, confirmed rebound from the Week 4 
value by >0.5 log 10 copies/ml;  
OR, if the Week 4 value is  ≤50 copies/ml, confirmed rebound to >50 copies/ml  
 
• Week 24: Confirmed value >50 copies/ml.  
 
Subjects who meet criteria for confirmed virologic failure will undergo real -time 
genotypic resistance testing (testing not provided by study) and an alternative 
regimen will be chosen by the site investigator with recommendations of the 
protocol team. F ollow -up intervals will continue per study protocol, but the site 
investigator may schedule additional non- study, safety visits as necessary. T he 
patient will be followed off study medication but on study for the remainder of the 
48 weeks of study.

Adhere nce to all study drugs will be monitored by self -report as per the Schedule of 
Events.  During the viral dynamics visits , all study medication dosing times and 
dates will be recorded by the study coordinator at each visit. All subjects should be 
provided a dherence reinforcement throughout the study, according to local standard 
practice.  Subjects who modify the ir study regimen or miss more than one -day dose 
of medication or miss more than one visit during the viral dynamics sequence (days 
2, 7, 10 and 14) w ill need to be replaced. However, s ubjects who discontinue/  
change study medication after day 14 will not  need to be replaced.  For all subjects 
discontinued from the study for any reason a premature discontinuation visit should 
done within 4 weeks  (see section 6.2.3 and 6.2.4) .

4.1 Inclusion Criteria  
4.1.1 HIV-1 infection, as documented by any licensed screening antibody test, 
such as ELISA, and confirmed by a second antibody test, such as Western

6.2 Definitions for Schedule of Events – Timing of Evaluations  
6.2.1 Pre -Entry  Evaluations  
 
Occur prior to the subject taking any study medications, treatments, or  
interventions.  
 
Patient Registration  
 
A patient identification number (PID) will be assigned to each patient 
screened for the study.  PIDs will include a site code and three- digit extension.  
PIDs should not be reassigned even if the patient fails to enter the study.  The 
PID must be included on every case report form ( CRF ) and patient blood 
sample.  Each site must maintain a master list of PIDs in a central location.  
The patient registration and inclusion/exclusion CRF must be completed on 
the online s ystem ( https://cfar.ucsd.edu/intranet ).  
 
Screening Site Clinical Labs  
 
If plasma HIV -1 RNA and CD4 + T-cell counts  were obtained at a CLIA -
approved lab no more than 90 days prior to screening and results are available 
then these labs do not need to be repeated. Otherwise, a plasma HIV -1 RNA 
level  and a CD4 cell count measurement need to be done at screening. Please 
record actual dates laboratories were done in the CRF.   
 
All other s tudy screening laboratories must be determined within 30 days of 
study entry (Day 0). Screening and entry evaluations must be separated by at 
least 48 hours. Hematology , chemistry  and pregnancy testing  will be 
coordinated through the site ’s local laboratory and results will be tracked by 
the CCTG Data Center .   
 
Once the screening laboratories have been done the patient will be evaluated 
for study eligibility if all other entry criteria are satisfied.   
 
The total blood volume for screening labs is 10 mL.  
 
If the HIV RNA or other la boratory values are outside the eligible range, the 
site may re -screen a patient on one occasion. However, the study will not pay 
for additional re -screening laboratories.  
 
Pre-Entry  
 
Specimens for proviral HIV DNA  need to  be shipped by each site in real -time 
to the central laboratory  (UCSD) .  
 
  CCTG 589 
  Protocol version 1.0 
   June 6, 2008  
 34 Plasma HIV -1 RNA and CD4 + T-cell counts should be obtained at the Pre -
Entry visit. The CD4 cell count should be done at the site’s local laboratory in 
real-time. However, the plasma for the HIV -1 RNA should be colle cted,  
stored then shipped in batch at  Day 14 of study  along with other phase 1 viral 
dynamic specimens . 
 
The total blood volume for pre -entry  labs is 30 mL . 
 
Randomization  
 
The screen  HIV RNA value will be used to stratify the patient ( at or above 
versus  below 100,000 copies/mL) prior to randomization.  
 
If the subject is randomized to the Atripla ® arm , then this subject should be 
contacted and supplied with a prescription for Atripla ®. Please remind the 
subject to fill medication as soon as possible and he /she must present with 
medication in hand on day of study entry. T he entry  visit for all subjects 
should occur within 7 days of randomization .  
 
Entry  
 
The entry  evaluation should be scheduled within 30 days of the screening 
visit.  The randomizati on shoul d be completed and a  30-day supply of 
treatment medication should be provided. If the subject is randomized to the 
LPV/r  arm, then study medications will be supplied by the study and 
dispensed by the site’s pharmacy  on day of entry . However, if the subject  is 
randomized to the EFV/TDF/FTC  arm, then a prescription must be provided 
prior to entry and the subject must present with medications in hand on day of 
entry.  The first dose of LPV/r + RAL  study medication should be given and 
witnessed by the study coor dinator  after drawing the baseline laboratories . 
The first dose of EFV/TDF/FTC  should be taken the  evening of study entry as 
a non- witnessed dose. A 14- day adherence diary should be completed by 
study personal during the viral dynamics sequence.  
 
6.2.2 On -Study Evaluations  
 
Evaluations should be counted from entry (Day 0).  S tart dates for  the viral 
decay sequence can occur on  Monday thru Wednesday .  Viral dynamic 
visits should occur  on days 2, 7, 10 and 14 or within a visit window of + 1 
day. Since blood f or proviral HIV DNA needs to be shipped in real -time 
for all visits ( except  day 10)  viral dynamic visits should be planned in 
ahead to occur only from Monday to Thursday  – avoiding Fridays . 
Thereafter, while on follow -up phase  of the therapy, study e valuat ions will 
occur on weeks 4  (+ 1 week) , 8 (+ 1 week) , 12 ( + 1 week) , 16 (+ 1 week) , 24 
(+ 2week) , 36 ( + 2 week)  and 48 ( + 2 week) . In instances of virologic failure 
  CCTG 589 
  Protocol version 1.0 
   June 6, 2008  
 35 and/or premature treatment discontinuation evaluations would also need to 
occur  within 4 wee ks. 
 
Total blood volume for laboratory evaluations f or viral dynamics sequence 
(entry to day 14)  will be approximately 167 mL .  
 
Total blood volume for laboratory evaluations f or follow -up phase (week 4 to 
week 48) will be approximately 266 mL.   
 
6.2.3 Eva luations and plan for randomized or registered  subjects that do not 
complete the viral dynamics portion of the study:  
 
a. Those subjects that do not start treatment will be replaced and will 
have no follow -up evaluations performed.  
 
b. Subjects on the vir al dynamics (entry to Day 14)  portion of the study 
that discontinue antiretroviral therapy before end  of Day 14 will be 
replaced and will have no follow -up evaluations performed.  
 
c. Subjects on the viral dynamics (entry to Day 14) portion of the study 
that miss more than one scheduled visit or 1- day equivalent of study 
medication will be replaced and followed on study but will not have 
proviral HIV DNA, extended flow cytometry or PBMC collected for 
storage.  
 
6.2.4 Evaluations  and plan for subjects that complete the viral dynamics but not the 
remainder of the study  
 
a. Subjects who complete the viral dynamics portion of the study  but 
then discontinue their antiretroviral regimen while on the follow -up 
portion of the study (weeks 2 to 48) will not be replaced a nd will be 
followed per protocol but will not have proviral HIV DNA, extended 
flow cytometry or PBMC collected for storage.  
 
b. Subjects that prematurely stop antiretroviral medications after the viral 
dynamics portion of the study and do not want to continue  on study 
will not be replaced and a Premature Treatment Discontinuation vist 
(see Section 6.1) should occur within 4 weeks.  
 
6.2.5 Change in Antiretrovi ral Regimen  
 
Subjects  who change their treatment regimen for any reason , should continue 
to be followed until  the completion of the study. However, they will not have  
proviral HIV DNA, extended flow cytometry, PBMC col lection for storage. 
 
  CCTG 589 
  Protocol version 1.0 
   June 6, 2008  
 36 If the regimen change is due to toxicity, then the subject would be followed 
per criteria of a Change of Therapy Due to Toxicity visit (section 6.1).  
 
If the r egimen change is due to virologic failure , then the subject would be 
evaluated per criteria for Virologic Failure visit (section 6.1).  
 
6.2.6 Virologic Failure  
 
Virologic failure will be defined as : 
 
• Week 4:  
Confirmed failure to achieve ≤50 copies/ml or, if >50 copies/ml, a 1 log 10 
copies/ml reduction from the baseline level;  
 
• Week 12:  
Confirmed failure to achieve ≤50 copies/ml or, if >50 copies/ml, a 2 log 10 
copies/ml reduction from baseline level;  
OR, if the Week 4 value i s >50 copies/ml, confirmed rebound from the Week 
4 value by >0.5 log 10 copies/ml;  
OR, if the Week 4 value is  ≤50 copies/ml, confirmed rebound to >50 
copies/ml  
 
• Week 24: Confirmed value >50 copies/ml.  
 
Confirmatory plasma HIV -1 RNA test must be performe d within 4 weeks of 
the initial HIV -1 RNA sample with suspected virologic failure.  Subjects who 
meet criteria for confirmed virologic failure will undergo real- time genotypic 
resistance testing (testing not provided by study) and an alternative regimen 
will be chosen by the site investigator with recommendations of the protocol 
team . Follow -up intervals will continue per study protocol, but the site 
investigator may schedule additional non- study, safety visits as necessary. T he 
patient will be followed  off study medication but on study  for the remainder 
of the 48 weeks of study .  
 
6.2.7 Post-Treatment Evaluations  
 
All randomized subjects  who complete the study will complete the week 48 
End of Study Visit .  
 
6.2.8 Premature Treatment Discontinuation  
 
These evaluat ions are required at the subject’s final visit.  
 
6.2.9 Pregnancy   
 
  CCTG 589 
  Protocol version 1.0 
   June 6, 2008  
 37 Women who become pregnant during the study will be required to 
permanently  discontinue their study regimens  and will not continue to be 
followed on study .  They should be advised to seek be st available medical 
care for their pregnancy according to US PH Guidelines . 
 
6.3 Special Instructions and Definitions of Evaluations  
 
6.3.1 Documentation of HIV  
 
HIV-1 infection, as documented by any licensed screening antibody test, such 
as ELISA, and co nfirmed by a second antibody test, such as Western blot , at 
any time prior to study entry. HIV -1 culture, HIV -1 antigen, two plasma HIV -
1 RNA >  2,000 copies/mL.  HIV -1 infection can also be documented by two 
plasma HIV -1 RNA > 2,000 copies/mL.  
 
6.3.2 HIV D rug Resistance Testing  
 
All subjects must have  resistance testing  (genotype ) obtained from any 
labor atory  and made available for review by the protocol team and site 
investigator  prior to  randomization .  Obtaining resistance testing for patients 
with HIV i nfection is part of standard medical care according to current 
guidelines. If a historic resistance test is not available at the time of screening 
then resistance testing will need to be done at screening. However, t he study  
will no t provide the resistance  assay.  Resistance testing results should be 
scanned and uploaded to the on- line data collecting system 
(https://cfar.ucsd.edu/intranet ).  
 
6.3.3 Medical and Laboratory History  
 
At screening , a medical histor y will be obtained and must be recorded in the 
source documents.  The medical history should include any  previous HIV -
related diagnoses and  AIDS -defin ing events .  
 
In addition, prior to obtaining screening laboratories, documentation of 
plasma HIV -1 RNA lo ad > 5000 copies/mL  and CD4+ T -cell counts >  50 
cells/mL  must be recorded in the source documents.  
 
6.3.4 Medication History  
 
At screening, a medication history  (only if within last 30 days prior to

 39 of virologic failure, record all Grade > 2 signs  and symptoms, HIV -related and 
AIDS -defining events and de aths on the CRFs  that have occurred since the 
last visit. Any signs or symptoms that lead to a change in treatment, regardless 
of Grade, must be recorded on the CRF .  The s ource document must include 
date of onset and date of resolution, but the CRF will only record prevalence 
of a given adverse event since the previous study visit.  
 
Refer to the Division of AIDS Table for Grading Adult Adverse Experiences, 
which can be found on the CCTG website: www.cctg.ucsd.edu   
 
Diagnoses

Total bilirubin, AST (SGOT), ALT (SGPT), and alkaline phosphatase, BUN, 
creatinine and elect rolytes (sodium, potassi um, chloride, and bicarbonate) will 
be performed in real time at the site’s local laboratory.  
 
Estimated creatinine clearance should be calculated each time a creatinine 
level is determined.  To estimate creatinine clearance, use the following 
method of Cockcroft and Gault:  
 
For men: [ (140 -  age in years) x (body weight in kg)]  ÷ (serum creatinine in 
mg/dL x 72). 
 
For women: use the same calculation as for men, then multiply the result by 
0.85.  
 
A calculator is available at the Data Management Center Web site at 
https://www.fstrf.org/ACTG/ .

6.3.9 Immunologic Studies  
 
Nadir CD4+  T-cell count  
  CCTG 589 
  Protocol version 1.0 
   June 6, 2008  
 41  
The subject’s prior nadir CD4+ T -cell count (absolute value and date) should 
be documented during screening and, when possible, a copy of t he nadir 
CD4+ T -cell count report should be included in the source document. If this 
documentation is not available, then subject recollection will suffice. For 
subjects who do not know the exact nadir value and for whom there  is no 
source documentation, t hen recall of the categorical nadir (e. g., <50, <100, 
<200 cells/mm3) will suffice.  
 
CD4/CD8  
 
All CD4/CD8 count and percentages must be performed at the site’s local 
laboratory  prior to study entry. Pre -entry and entry measurements must be 
obtained at two separate time points at least 48 hours apart.  The mean of the 
pre-entry and entry measurements will be used as the baseline value. See 
section 6.1 for specific collection dates.  
 
Because of the diurnal variation in CD4+ and CD8+ T -cell counts; all 
determ inations should be obtained consistently in either the morning or the 
afternoon throughout the study, if possible.  
 
Blood volume: 5 mL  
 
Extended Flow Cytometry Markers  
 
Extended flow markers for activation, maturation, apoptosis and regulatory 
function wil l be evaluated on CD4+/CD8+ T -cells. Samples will be collected 
at entry and on weeks 4 and 24.  These analyses will be done on fresh samples 
in real -time. Specimens will need to be shipped ambient, overnight and in 
real-time to the UCSD central laboratory .

Entry and during the Viral Dynamic Sequence [Day 0, 2, 7 and 14 ( except  
Day 10)] and at weeks 4, 24 and 48. Spec imens should be shipped 
immediately after collection to the central lab (UCSD).  
 
Blood volume: 10 mL  
 
Plasma HIV -1 RNA  
  CCTG 589 
  Protocol version 1.0 
   June 6, 2008  
 42  
Pre-entry  HIV-1 RNA must be collected and stored prior to study entry then 
shipped in batch on Day 14 to the central lab (UCSD) . Pre-entry and entry 
measurements must be obtained at two separate time points at least 48 hours 
apart.  The mean of the pre- entry and entry measurements will be used as the 
baseline value. See section 6.1 for specific collection dates.  
 
Plasma HIV -1 RNA during t he Viral Dynamic Sequence should be colle cted 
at every study visit (Day 0, 2, 7, 10 and 14) and stored until  shipped in batch 
to the central lab (UCSD)  after completion of the viral decay dynamics  (Day 
14). Afterw ards, during the follow -up phase of the study , the HIV RNA load 
should be determined at the site’s local laboratory at weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 
36 and 48. 
 
 
Genotype Resistance Assay  
 
If a historic genotype resistance test is not available at screen , a baseline 
genotype test should be done at screening (this test will not be provided by the 
study). In addition, s amples for genotypic analysis obtained at the time of 
virologic failure should be done  in real time  a the local laboratory  for subject 
management by the site’s  investigator  (this test will no t be provided by the 
study) . All resistance testing results should be scanned and uploaded on the 
on-line data collection system for review by the protocol team 
(https://cfar.ucsd.edu/intranet ). 
 
Stored Plasm a 
 
Stored Plasma  will be collected at screening, study entry , all visits of the viral 
dynamics sequence and during weeks 4, 8, 12, 24 and 48.   
 
* Specimens  obtained during pre -entry , entry and viral dynamics will be 
stored at the site’s local laboratory and batched shipped to the central 
laboratory (UCSD) after completion of the viral dynamics sequence.  
  
** Specimens obtained at weeks  4, 8, 12, 24 and 48 will be stored at the site’s

48.  
 
Blood volume: 10 mL  
 
6.3.12 Adherence Questionnaires  
 
Medication diaries  will be conducted by study personal during the viral 
dynamics sequence. Dosing dates and exact times of study medications will 
need to be recorded. Afterwards, on the follow -up portion of the study, 
adherence questionnaires (standard ACTG style questionnaires) will be 
conducted on weeks  4, 8,  12, 16, 24, 36 and 48 of therapy and in instances of 
virologic failure and/or premature treatment discontinuation.  
 
6.4 Off-Drug Requirements  
Additional safety monitoring and reporting of serious adverse experiences (SAEs) 
continues to be required upon completion or discontinuation of study treatment 
regardless of whether a protocol follow -up period is s cheduled to occur. A dverse 
experiences occurring during the immediate 8 -week period after the last dose of 
study treatment which meet SAE reporting requirements must be reported to the 
CCTG Data Center . Additional ly, after 8 weeks OFF study treatment, there are 
four types of events that must be reported to the CCTG Data Center  if the 
relationship to the study drug is assessed by the site physician as definitely, 
possibly, or unable to judge : DEATHS, NEW ONSET CANCE RS, CONGENITAL 
ANOMALIES, AND PERMANENT DISABILITIES.  
 
 
7.0 TOXICITY MANAGEMENT   
 
Only toxicities related to study medications (LPV/r, RAL , TDF, 3TC and EFV) will 
be considered in the toxicity management section. The management of these 
medication related toxicities should be undertaken by the local investigators, with 
guidance available from the protocol team, protocol pharmacist and pharmaceutical 
sponsor, to insure the optimal safety and effic acy for the individual subject. 
 
Toxicity resulting from any n on-study medications (other than study medications as 
listed above) should be managed per standard of care. The grading system is located 
in the Division of AIDS Table for Grading Adult Adverse Experiences, which can 
be found on the Division of AIDS Regula tory Compliance Center Web Site:  
http://rcc.tech -res-intl.com . 
   
NOTE: The study Co -chairs and the study protocol team need to be notified by e -
mail regarding any toxicities that result in a change in regimen .  In case an EFV 
containing regimen needs to be discontinued, consideration should be given to 
  CCTG 589 
  Protocol version 1.0 
   June 6, 2008  
 44 discontinue EFV prior to stopping the other component s of the antir etroviral 
regimen. Simultaneous discontinuation of a n EFV containing regimen leads to de 
facto EFV mono- therapy due to difference of half lives  between  EFV and other 
ARV drugs.  
 
 
7.1 Grade 1 or 2  
 
Subjects who develop a Grade 1 or 2 adverse event or toxicity may continue study 
drugs without alteration of the dosage, except for Grade > 2 creatinine elev ation in 
subjects receiving TDF (component of Atripla ).  Those subjects experiencing 
Grades  1 or 2 adverse events which results in discontinuation of, or substitution, for 
any of the study drugs should be reported to the protocol team.  
 
7.2 Grade 3  
 
Management of Grade 3 toxicities should be discussed with the protocol team via 
email. Please refer to the subsequent sections for management of specific events.  
 
Subjects who develop a Grade 3 adverse event or toxicity judged to be study drug-
related should have  all medications held or have the toxicity causative study drug 
switched to an alternative drug.  In the event that the regimen is held, that subject 
should be re -evaluated weekly until the adverse event returns to Grade ≤  2, at which 
time the study drugs may be reintroduced at the discretion of the investigator or 
according to standard practice.   Subjects experiencing Grade 3 adverse events 
requiring permanent discontinuation of any study drug should be followed weekly 
until resolution of the adverse event .  The treatment regimen should be modified at 
the discretion of the site investigator and subjects should be encouraged to remain 
in the study.  Exemptions include asymptomatic elevations of CPK, cholesterol or 
triglycerides. For these laboratories, medic ation may be continued at the discretion 
of the site investigator and laboratories repeated within 2 weeks.    If the toxicity or 
laboratory elevation is thought not to be due to study medication, the study 
medication may be continued with follow -up at the  discretion of the primary 
provider.  
 
7.3 Grade 4  
 
Management of Grade 4 toxicities should be discussed with the protocol team via 
email.  
 
Subjects who develop a Grade 4 adverse event or toxicity judged to be study drug 
related will have the presumed causative study drug(s) permanently discontinued 
and another drug will be substituted. Subjects experiencing Grade 4 adverse events 
should be followed weekly until resolution of the adverse event.  At that time, they 
will resume study visits and evaluations accordi ng to the Schedule of Events. A 
new regimen may be chosen at the discretion of the local investigator.  Exemptions 
  CCTG 589 
  Protocol version 1.0 
   June 6, 2008  
 45 include: asymptomatic elevations of cholesterol or triglycerides that can be 
managed with diet and/or lipid lowering therapy or CPK , if the CP K elevation is not 
felt to be related to study medications . For these laboratories, medication may be 
continued with follow -up at the discretion of the site investigator.  If the toxicity or 
laboratory elevation is thought not  to be due to study medication, the study 
medication may be continued and laboratories repeated within 2 weeks. If it is not 
possible for the investigator to discern the causative agent, then all study 
medications must be discontinued. 
 
7.4 Rash  
 
Rash may be caused by therapies in any of t he major antiretroviral classes or by 
other therapies commonly used as concurrent medications, such as cotrimoxazole. 
As it is not possible to provide an exhaustive list of products that may cause rash in 
this protocol, please consult the product informati on leaflets for other products for 
information relating to rash.   
 
Rash and any associated symptoms should be reported as adverse events and 
appropriate toxicity ratings should be used to grade the events.   
 
If the etiology of the rash can be definitivel y diagnosed as being due to a specific 
medical event or a concomitant medicinal product, routine management should be 
performed and documentation of the diagnosis provided.  
 
For Grade 2  rash antihistamines, topical corticosteroids, or a brief course of 
systemic corticosteroids, at the discretion of the site investigator, may be prescribed 
and subjects may continue all study medications. The subject should be advised to 
contact the physician immediately if there is any worsening of the rash.  EFV (as 
part o f Atripla®) may be temporarily discontinued along with all other study 
medications, at the site investigator’s discretion, until the cutaneous toxicity returns 
to Grade <1, at which time therapy should be reinstituted at full dose. The subject 
should be cl osely monitored for recurrence of the rash. The protocol team should be 
consulted. 
 
If the rash is considered to be most likely due to concomitant illness or medication, 
standard management, including discontinuation of the likely causative agent, 
should be undertaken. If no other causative factor is found after clinical evaluation, 
the subject should be treated symptomatically until the rash resolves.  
 
For Grade 3  rash thought to be related to the study medications, subjects should 
either discontinue all drugs or consider switching from the likely causative agent.  
 
For Grade 4  rash s ubjects should discontinue all study medications. The Protocol 
team should be consulted. 
 
NOTE: In the event that Grade 2, 3, or 4 rash fails to resolve, increases in severity, 
  CCTG 589 
  Protocol version 1.0 
   June 6, 2008  
 46 is associated with systemic (fever, malaise, nausea) or allergic (e.g., urticaria) 
symptoms, or is associated with exfoliative dermatitis or mucous membrane 
involvement or erythema, multiforme or suspected Stevens -Johnson syndrome or 
necrosis requiring su rgery, all study medications should be temporarily 
discontinued until symptom resolution. Some or all study medications may then be 
reintroduced.  
 
7.5 Skin hyperpigmentation  
 
Development of skin hyperpigmentation, if assessed as being related to FTC, can be 
followed without modification of therapy, at the discretion of the site investigator.  
 
7.6 Nausea and Vomiting  
 
Nausea and vomiting may be treated symptomatically with oral antiemetics or 
antiemetic suppositories. For Grade >3 nausea or vomiting thought to be secondary 
to study drugs that fails to improve on antiemetics to Grade <2, all study drugs may 
be held until Grade <2. If Grade >3 nausea or vomiting recurs with reinstitution of 
study drugs or persists beyond 14 days despite symptomatic  management, then 
other antiviral agents may be substituted.  
 
7.7 Diarrhea  
 
For Grade <2 diarrhea the s tudy treatment should continue without interruption.  
Subjects with diarrhea of any toxicity grade may be treated symptomatically with 
permitted antimotility agents.   For Grad e 3 or 4 diarrhea that is unresponsive to 
antimotility agents and for which an alternative etiology (e.g., infectious diarrhea) is 
not established, all study medications should be interrupted until resolution of 
diarrhea to Grade ≤  2 or baseline  and then s tudy treatment can be resumed at the 
discretion or the site investigator.   If Grade ≥  3 diarrhea recurs upon the resumption 
of study medications, all study medications should be interrupted and the protocol 
team should be notified for alternative antiretro viral therapy.  
 
7.8 Hyperglycemia  
 
Fasting hyperglycemia of > 110 to 125 mg/dL is considered evidence of impaired 
glucose tolerance.  A fasting blood glucose level above 126 mg/dL is highly 
suggestive of diabetes mellitus.  Subjects with previously undiagnosed fasting 
hyperglycemia may continue study medications at the discretion of the investigator, 
but should be discussed with the protocol team via email.  A confirmatory fasting 
glucose must be obtained within 4 weeks and prior to the institution of medical 
therapy.  Hyperglycemia may be treated with oral hypoglycemic agents or insulin 
according to standard guidelines. 
 
7.9 AST/ALT Elevations  
 
  CCTG 589 
  Protocol version 1.0 
   June 6, 2008  
 47 All s tudy medications may be continued for asymptomatic Grade <3 AST/ALT 
elevations at the discretion of the site investig ator after discussion with the protocol 
team.  Careful assessments should be done to rule out the use of alcohol, non- study 
medication -related drug toxicity, or viral hepatitis as the cause of the Grade 3 
elevation.  The possibility of lactic acidosis synd rome should also be explored.  
 
For symptomatic Grade 3 and all Grade 4 elevations of AST  or ALT , all study 
drugs should be stopped and the protocol team consulted,  Repeat laboratories 
should be performed and all study medications held until the toxicity r eturns to 
Grade < 2.  If symptomatic Grade 3 or any Grade 4 elevation in AST or ALT recurs  
upon reinitiation of therapy, treatment should be stopped and alternative ARV 
therapy considered in consultation with the protocol team.  
 
7.10 Lipase elevation  
 
Pancreati tis will be reported as either clinical (i.e., symptomatic) or chemical (i.e., 
persistent elevation in enzymes without any symptoms).  
 
For asymptomatic  lipase elevation Grade >  3, lipase should be repeated within 2 
weeks and triglyceride levels should be checked. For Grade > 3 asymptomatic 
lipase elevation on repeat testing, the implicated drug(s) should be stopped at the 
discretion of the site investigator and in consultation with the protocol team. When 
lipase returns to Grad <  2, the implicated drug(s) may be restarted or may be 
replaced if a substitution can be identified, at the discretion of the site investigator. 
Routine evaluation of lipase are not required by the study.  
 
Symptomatic  pancreatitis is not commonly associated with study -provided drugs . If 
clinical pancreatitis is suspected, please refer to the ACTG Definition of 
Pancreatitis, located at  
http://aactg.s -3.com/members/download/other/pancdefv2.doc .  
The protocol te am should be informed.   
 
7.11 Creatinine Elevations  
 
Discontinue TDF if confirmed creatinine clearance becomes < 50 mL/min.   
Subjects should be followed as medically indicated until the creatinine returns to 
Grade < 2. The protocol team should be notified wit hin 48 hours of any permanent 
therapy discontinuations. 
 
7.12 Hypertriglycredemia / Hypercholesterolemia  
 
Subjects who experience asymptomatic triglyceride or cholesterol elevations may 
continue to receive study drugs. Only triglyceride levels obtained in a fasting state 
should be evaluated for toxicity management. For Grade >3, confirmatory fasting 
triglyceride should be obtained within 4 weeks and must be obtained prior to the 
institution of medical therapy for hyperlipidemia.  
  CCTG 589 
  Protocol version 1.0 
   June 6, 2008  
 48  
Subjects with asymptomatic  triglyceride or cholesterol elevation should be 
counseled on dietary modification. Oral antihyperlipidemic agents should be 
considered at the discretion of the site investigator (and documented on the 
concomitant drug CRF). Guidelines for the treatment of  hyperlipidemia are 
available on the ACTG web site  
(http://aactg.s -3.com/members/download/other/metabolic/Chol.rtg ).  
 
Resin binding agents, such as cholestyramine and colesti pol, should be avoided as 
they may interfere with absorption of LPV/r as well as the absorption of other drugs 
and fat -soluble vitamins.       
 
7.13 CNS  Symptoms with EFV  
 
Subjects should be informed that these symptoms are likely to improve with 
continued ARV therapy. Dosing at bedtime improves the tolerability of these 
symptoms and is recommended. Subjects receiving EFV should be alerted to the 
potential for additive CNS effects when EFV is used concomitantly with alcohol or 
psychoactive drugs.  In addition, t aking EFV with food may increase blood levels 
and CNS symptoms.  In the event of treatment -limiting (in the opinion of the site 
investigator) CNS AE s attributable to EFV, the protocol team should be informed 
and EFV should be discontinued and alternative r egimens discussed .  
 
7.14  Pregnancy  
 
Women who become pregnant on study must continue all study medications 
immediately and must prematurely discontinue the study. The protocol team should 
be notified. In addition, pregnancy outcome data will be collected and recorded in 
her source document and on the CRF.  
 
Sites are strongly discouraged to register any pregnancy that occurs on study with 
The Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry as soon as the site become aware of it. More 
information is available at www.apregistry.com . Phone: 800- 259-4263; Fax; 800-
800-1052.

9.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 
9.1 General Design Issues  
 
This is a 1: 1 randomized, open- label, pilot study of RAL + LPV/r  vs. Atripla® in 
HIV-1-infected, treatment -naïve subjects for 48 weeks . During the initial 2 -week 
period, subjects will undergo intensive monitoring of viral decay dynamics 
(baseline, days 2, 7, 10, 14) and immune T -cell subset changes (baseline and week 
4).  From weeks 4 to 48, subjects will be monitored for treatment efficacy (CD4+ 
cell counts, and plasma HIV -1 RNA levels) and safety/ tolerability (hematology, 
chemistry, fasting lipids and symptom questio nnaire) .  
  
9.2 Endpoints  
 
Primary :   
 
The viral decay rate of the phase 1 decay in HIV RNA. 
 
Secondary : 
 
1. The proportion of participants with plasma HIV RNA <  50 copies/mL at week 
48. 
 
2. The proportion of participants with treatment failure at week 48.  
 
3. Time to treatment failure.  
 
4.   The c hange in CD4+ T -cell absolute count and percentage fr om baseline week 
48. 
 
  CCTG 589 
  Protocol version 1.0 
   June 6, 2008  
 50 5. The change in CD4+ T -cell absolute count and percentage during phase 1 
(baseline to week 12) and phase 2 (weeks 12 to 48) immune recovery.  
 
6. The proportion of CD4+ /CD8+  T-cell immune activation, maturation, 
regulatory and apoptosis markers at baseline and weeks 4 and 24.  
 
7.   Fasting lipid profiles (total cholesterol, high- density cholesterol, calculated LDL 
cholesterol, triglycerides) a t baseline weeks 12, 24 and 48. 
 
8. Grades > 2 laboratory abnorm alities and signs and symptoms.  
 
9. Time to trea tment discontinuation due to toxicity . 
 
9.3 Sample Size  
 
Primary objective: To compare the antiviral potency as measured by phase 1 plasma 
viral de cay rates between RLT + LPV and EFV + TDF + FTC .  
 
In A5160, a viral dynamics sub- study of A5142, the first -phase viral decay rate (d 1) 
for EFV + 2 NRTI regimen (n=25 subjects) was 0.638 days-1 (IQR: 0.577, 0.703) 
and 0.530 days-1 (IQR: 0.414, 0.662) for L PV + 2 NRTI (n=22 subjects) 
combinations.  EFV -containing combinations had a significantly faster decay rate 
that LPV/r -based regimens (difference of 0.108 days-1; P=0.03). Although similar 
intensive phase 1 viral decay data are not yet available, plasma H IV RNA levels 
were 70% lower at day 14 of treatment in RLT + TDF/3TC vs. EFV + TDF/3TC 
treated patients (Murray J, et al., Abstract TUAB103). Therefore, we hypothesize 
that the RLT + LPV/r combination will have a greater phase 1 viral decay rate 
compared t o EFV + TDF + FTC.  
 
The study is powered to compare the phase 1 viral decay rate between the 
EFV+TCD+FTC and RLT+LPV/r groups using a two- sided, two- sample t -test with 
alpha=0.05. Assuming the phase 1 viral decay rate for EFV+TCD+FTC (d1) is 
0.638, we calc ulated power for the following situations. 
 
Table 1. Power to declare difference in phase 1 decay rate d1, for various 
differences and standard deviations with n=25 per group.  
 
Difference 
between arms in 
d1 SD, decay 
rate Power  
0.1 0.1 93% 
0.1 0.12 82% 
0.12 0.15 79% 
 
Assuming the SD of the viral decay rate is 0.12, the study has 82% power to detect 
a 0.1 difference in the decay rates between the EFV+TCD+FTC and RLT+LPV/r

9.4 Methods of Analysis  
 
9.4.1 Analysis of Pr imary Objectives  
 
Repeated HIV RNA measured at different time points (baseline, days 2, 7, 10, 14) 
will be treated as the outcome variable in a linear mixed -effects model. The primary 
fixed effects will include time, treatment group, treatment group -by-time 
interaction; random effects will include both intercept and slope allowing each 
subject to have individual baseline viral load and viral decay rate. The treatment 
group -by- time interaction term in the model will indicate the difference in viral 
decay rates betw een the two treatment groups. Baseline covariate adjustment will 
be included if necessary.  
 
9.4.2 Analysis of Secondary Objectives  
 
Secondary analyses will include descriptive statistics and tests of significance 
between the two treatment arms.  All sign ificance tests will be two -sided and no 
adjustment for multiple comparisons will be made.  If necessary due to assumption 
failures, appropriate non -parametric statistical tests will be applied.  
 
1a. Differences in the proportion of participants on each arm  with plasma HIV RNA 
< 50 copies/mL at week 48 will be compared via Fisher’s exact test (intention to 
treat analysis with data imputation for missing data).  
 
1b. Differences in the proportion of participants on each arm with plasma HIV 
RNA < 50 copies/mL a t week 48 will be compared via Fisher’s exact test (no data 
imputation for missing data).  
 
2. Differences in the proportion of participants on each arm with treatment failure 
(defined as non- completer, protocol -defined virologic failure, treatment 
disconti nuation, or change in treatment regimen) at week 48 will be compared via 
Fisher’s exact test . 
 
3. Differences in time to treatment failure (defined as non -completer, protocol -
defined virologic failure, treatment discontinuation, or change in treatment regi men)  
will be compared via Kaplan -Meier curves and the log -rank test.  
 
4. Differences in the change in CD4+ T -cell absolute count and percentage from 
baseline to week 48 will be compared via a two -sample Student t -test. 
 
5a. Differences in the change in CD4+ T -cell absolute count and percentage from 
baseline to week 12 (Phase 1) and week 12 to week 48 (Phase 2) will be compared 
via separate two -sample Student t -tests.  
 
  CCTG 589 
  Protocol version 1.0 
   June 6, 2008  
 52 5b. Association between viral decay kinetics and Phase 1 CD4 recovery will be 
determined v ia Pearson’s correlation analysis.  
 
6a. Differences in the proportion of CD4+/CD8+ T -cell immune activation, 
maturation, regulatory and apoptosis markers at baseline and weeks 4 and 24 will 
be separately compared cross -sectionally via Fisher’s exact test.  
 
6b. Association between change in early immune subsets and phase 2 CD4 recovery 
will be assessed via Pearson’s correlation analysis  
 
7. Differences in fasting lipid profiles (total cholestero l, high- density cholesterol, 
calculated LDL cholesterol, trigly cerides) at baseline weeks 12, 24 and 48 will be 
compared cross -sectionally via two -sample Student t -tests.   
 
8. Differences in proportions of grades > 2 laboratory abnormalities and signs and 
symptoms will be compared via Fisher’s exact test.  
 
9. Differen ces in time to treatment discontinuation because of toxicity/intolerance 
will be compared via Kaplan -Meier curves and the log -rank test.  
 
9.5  Monitoring 
 
It is the responsibility of the Principal Investigator and the CCTG protocol team to 
interpret the viral response and toxicity data and make any decisions needed to 
protect patients from undue risk. S afety and tolerability of the study medications 
will be monitored by means of adverse event reports (AER) and bimonthly toxicity 
reports presenting laboratory and clinical data. Safety data will be tabulated by 
study arm and reviewed by the statisticians but study arm assignment will be 
blinded to protocol team and site investigator’s unless safety issues require an un-
blinding. These reports will be discussed by the protocol t eam on monthly 
conference calls . Accrual and toxicity summaries will be provided to the Protocol 
Chairs and CCTG Investigators by the Data Manager and Biostatistician.  
 
The study will undergo an internal review b y the protocol chairs and stud y team 
when either t welve subjects in the RAL+LPV/r arm have enrolled or after one year 
has elapsed from when the first subject was enrolled, whichever comes first. The 
study would be reviewed by an independent Study Monitoring Committee if 
protocol chairs  deemed necessary or if greater than 30% of subjects in the 
RAL+LPV/r arm (and at least 12 subjects enrolled in this arm) experience virologic 
failure. The independent  review committee will be composed of at least 3 people 
(including one statistician) outs ide the protocol team. The committee will make 
specific recommendations about changes to the study protocol.

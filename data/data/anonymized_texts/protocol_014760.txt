 1. SYNOPSIS 
TITLE:   A Phase 2  Multi -center, Open -label Study of Oral ENMD -2076 for the Treatment of Patients with 
Advanced Fibrolamellar Carcinoma (FLC)  
INVESTIGATIONAL PRODUCT:  ENMD -2076 
INDICATION:   Fibrolamella r Carcinoma  
PHASE OF DEVELOPMENT:   II 
INVESTIGATIONAL SITES/LOCATIONS:   Multi -centers,  a list of investigators and affiliated investigational 
sites/locations is maintained in the trial master file  
OBJECTIVES:    
Primary Objective :  
• To determine the Overall Response Rate (ORR) using RECIST  v 1.1 criteria when patients with advanced 
fibrolamellar carcinoma (FLC) are treated with daily oral ENMD -2076 
Secondary Objectives:  
• To evaluate the 6-month Progression F ree Survival (PFS6) rate when patients with FLC are treated with daily 
oral ENMD -2076.  
• To evaluate the median Progression Free Survival (PFS) , Time to Progression  (TTP) , and Overall Survival 
(OS).  
• To determine the safety of ENMD -2076 as defined by the frequency and severity of adverse events when 
patients with FLC are treated with daily o ral ENMD -2076.  
• To explore biomarkers predictive of tumor response to ENMD -2076 in FLC patients. 
 
STUDY DESIGN:   This is a Phase 2 study  in 29 patients with advanced FLC . Primary efficacy analysis will be 
based on overall response rate using RECIST v 1.1 criteria . Secondary endpoints will include 6-month 
progression free survival rate, median PFS , TTP, and OS and the evaluation of safety.  
Patients will be given  an oral, daily dose of ENMD -2076 based on body surface area . In case of adverse events , 
two dose  reductions at the discretion of the investigator will be allowed for each patient .  If adverse events 
resolve, the dose can be increased in 50 mg increments as tolerated.   Dosing interruptions/delays will be allowed 
at the discretion of the investigator for recovery from adverse events or inter -current illness, particularly if the 
patient is benefiting from therapy with ENMD -2076.  After a treatment interruption for adverse events , treatment 
can be resumed at a lower dose and increased in 50 mg increments  as tolerated.  
Tumor measurements will occur every two months (± 1 week) after initial study drug administration. The overall 
response rate will be determined based on RECIST v 1.1 criteria. Survival and time to progression will be 
determined as the time fro m first study drug administration until death from any cause or documented 
progression. Patients who discontinue therapy for any reason other than progression will continue to receive 
imaging  until progression or death.  
An interim analysis will be conduct ed after 1 6 patients will have reac hed study endpoints of response s 
per RECIST 1.1 criteria after two cycles of treatment ..  The purpose of the interim analysis is to determine 
whether it is futile to continue the study .

setting of current FLC diagnosis.  
 
TEST PRODUCT(S), DOSE AND MODE OF ADMINISTRATION:   ENMD -2076 is provided as hard 
gelatin capsules containing 50 mg of drug. 
Patients will receive a dail y oral dose (fasting) of ENMD -2076 of 150, 200 or 250 mg/day  based on body surface 
area.  
DURATION OF TREATMENT:   Following the Screening and Baseline Period (Day -28 to 1) each  treatment 
cycle will consist of a 4 -week Treatment Period (Cycle 1 to Cycle 6 +). Patients will be treated until disease 
progression, unacceptable toxicity or death.  
DISCONTINUATION FROM TREATMENT:   
The Investigator or the Sponsor may discontinue individual patients from the study at any time.  Patients will be 
encouraged to complete the study; however, they may voluntarily withdraw at any time.  The Investigator or designee will document the reason for discontinuation. Patients who went off therapy without evidence of disease progression will have CT scans every two  months until d isease progression or death.  
 A patient will be withdrawn from treatment for the following reasons:  
• Significant adverse event  
• Pregnancy  
• Disease progression  
• Consent withdrawn  
• Noncompliance  
 
PRIMARY EFFICACY ENDPOINT:  
Overall response rate  based on RECIST v  1.1 criteria will be used to evaluate response every two months after 
first study drug administration. Patients who go off therapy without evidence of disease progression will have CT 
scans every two months until progression.   
SECONDARY EFFICACY ENDPOINTS:  
• Progression -free survival rate at 6 months (PFS6).   
• The median PFS or TTP as based on RECIST 1.1 and  measured by time from first study drug administration

Confidential    5 of 50 until progression or death.  
• The median overall survival as measured by time from first study drug administration  to death or study 
completion.  
• Safety data will be collected from time of informed consent through study completion /withdrawal up to 30 
days after the last dose of study medication by each subject.  
 
SAFETY ENDPOINTS:  
Safety will be evaluated by collecting information on adverse events and by routine assessments.  All adverse 
events will be graded using the NCI CTCAE version 4.0 and recorded in the CRF.  Specific safety assessments include the following:  
 
• Treatment -emergent AEs graded accord ing to NCI CTCAE  v4. The frequency and severity of AEs will be 
evaluated following administration of oral ENMD -2076 
• Change  from Baseline  in vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and body temperature)  
• Change  from Baseline  in clinical laboratory tests from values obtained prior to treatment  
• Change  from Baseline  in electrocardiograms (ECGs)  
 
Serious adverse events require expedited reporting to the medical monitor as described in the protocol . 
 
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS:    
We have designed th is study using a Simon’s Optimal two -stage design to allow for an early interim analysis to 
determine potential futility and an overall final analysis with criteria established to allow for sufficient power and 
type 1 error rate to provide results to suppo rt this Phase 2 trial.  The null hypothesis that the true response rate is 
2% will be tested against a one -sided alternative  that the true response rate is 15% . In the first stage, 16 patients 
will have reached study endpoints of response s per  RECIST 1.1 criteria after two cycles of treatment. If  there are 
zero responses in these 16 patients, the study will be stopped. Otherwise, 13 additional patients will be accrued for a total of 29. The null hypothesis will be rejected if 2 or more responses are observ ed in 29 patients. This 
design yields a type I error rate of 9.4%  and power of 90% when the true response rate is 15%. The probability of 
early termination due to drug inefficacy is 72%.

of the study that are relevant to the subject's decision to participate. The consent form must be 
signed and dated by the subject before he/she is exposed to any protocol-specific procedure. 
The investigator will explain that the subjects are completely free to refuse to enter the study or 
to withdraw from it at any time, without any consequences for their further care and without the 
need to justify. 
The patient will receive a copy of the patient information and the signed informed consent.  The patient will be informed if information becomes available that may be relevant to his/her 
willingness to continue participation in the study. 
Each subject will be informed that a monitor or a health authority inspector, in accordance with 
applicable regulatory requirements, may review the portions of their source records and source 
data related to the study. Data protection and confidentiality will be handled in compliance with 
local laws. 
3.4 Approval of the Study Protocol and Amendments 
Substantive changes in the protocol include changes that affect the safety of patients or changes 
that alter the scope of the investigation, the scientific quality of the study, the experimental design, dosages, assessment variable(s), the number of patients treated, or the patient selection criteria.  Such changes must be prepared as a protocol amendment by the Study Monitor and implemented only upon joint approval of the Sponsor, Investigator, and the Study Monitor.  A 
protocol amendment must receive IRB approval prior to implementation.  In parallel with the

authority as an amendment to the regulatory submission under which the study is being conducted.  If a protocol amendment requires changes in the informed consent document, the revised informed consent document prepared by the Investigator must be approved by the 
Sponsor, Study Monitor, and the IRB. 
 Emergency departures from the protocol that eliminate an apparent immediate hazard to a particular patient and that are deemed crucial for the safety and well-being of that patient may be instituted for that patient only.  The Investigator or other attending physician also will contact the 
Medical Monitor as soon as possible in the case of such a departure.  These departures do not 
require pre-approval by the IRB; however, the IRB and Medical Monitor must be notified in writing as soon as possible after the departure has been made.  In addition, the Investigator will document in the patient’s CRF the reasons for the protocol deviation and the ensuing events.  
3.5 Ongoing Information for Institutional Review Board  
While the study is ongoing and at study completion/discontinuation, the Investigator must submit to the IRB the following information in accordance with US Federal regulatory requirements:  
• Information on serious or unexpected AEs showing due diligence in providing this 
information as soon as possible 
• Periodic reports on the progress of the study  
• Final Study Summary upon study completion or premature closure of study 
3.6 Premature Closure of the Study  
The Sponsor reserves the right to temporarily suspend or prematurely discontinue this study 
either at a single site or at all sites at any time and for any reason.  If such action is taken, CASI Pharmaceuticals will discuss this with the Investigators (including the reasons for taking such 
action) at that time.  CASI Pharmaceuticals will promptly inform all Investigators and/or 
institutions conducting the study if the study is suspended or terminated for safety reasons, and will also inform the regulatory authorities of the suspension or termination of the study and the reason(s) for the action.

4. INTRODUCTION  
4.1 Background 
Fibrolamellar carcinoma (FLC) is a rare malignant neoplasm of the liver. It has distinct clinical, 
histological and prognostic features from conventional hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). It 
generally occurs in young individuals and is typically not associated with such underlying liver 
diseases as hepatitis and cirrhosis or other risks commonly present in HCC.  FLC represents 0.6% to 8.6% of all hepatocellular carcinomas, according to 1986 to 1999 SEER data and various international series (El Serag et al., 2004; Sooklim et al., 2003; Moreno-Luna et al., 2005).
 
 FLC is often advanced when diagnosed due to lack of symptoms (Yen and Chang 2009). 
Surgical resections are the optimal treatment for localized tumors, FLC has a very high recurrence rate. In cases of postoperative recurrence, resection is not often possible. As the tumor is quite rare, there is no standard first line systemic treatment option available. The survival rate 
for FLC largely depends on whether (and to what degree) the cancer has metastasized, i.e. spread to the lymph nodes or other organs (Ang et al., 2006). Overall prognosis remains poor, because 
of its primary chemo resistance and early recurrence of metastasis. The absence of treatment 
options highlights the need for new compounds with activity in this patient population. Tumor growth relies on angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels from pre-existing vascular 
beds, in order to receive an adequate supply of oxygen and nutrients (Semela and Dufour, 2004). 
Inhibition of angiogenesis may represent a therapeutic option in the treatment of FLC.  Recent clinical genomic research published in Science (Honeyman et al., 2014) reported the 
identification of a recurrent DNAJB1-PRKACA chimeric transcript that is expressed in 100% of 
FLC tumor tissue examined but not in adjacent normal liver, suggesting that this genetic alteration contributes to tumor pathogenesis of FLC. The chimeric RNA is predicted to code for 
a protein that is the catalytic domain of protein kinase A, which results in Aurora A kinase being 
overly expressed in FLC patients. Aurora kinases A, an important regulator in the cell 
proliferation process and often over-expressed in human cancers, is therefore believed to be a promising therapeutic target for FLC.   
 
VEGF is one of the main inducers of liver tumor angiogenesis. Increased levels of VEGF have been observed in HCC. Hepatoma cells are believed to possess a proliferation mechanism regulated by an autocrine mechanism, a paracrine mechanism, or both, which are mediated by 
FGF-1/FGFR or FGF-2/FGFR (or both). In addition, a gain of FGF-R2 (IIIb), -R2 (IIIc), and -R3 
(IIIb) may be associated with malignant transformation of liver tumor and may eventually serve 
as useful diagnostic and prognostic indicators (Asada et al., 2003).  
4.2 Rationale  
ENMD-2076 is an orally active, small molecule, multi-targeted kinase inhibitor with a mechanism of action against angiogenesis, proliferation and the cell cycle. ENMD-2076 has

Version 8. 1  Sept 14, 2015 
______________________________________________________________________________ 
 
Confidential    13 of 50 selective activity against the mitotic kinase Aurora A, as well as kinases involved in 
angiogenesis (VEGFRs, fibroblast growth factor receptors-FGFRs) and cell growth (Src).  
 In pre-clinical in vivo animal model studies, ENMD-2076 exhibited anti-angiogenic activity by 
preventing the formation of new blood vessels and inducing regression of formed vessels at well-tolerated doses. ENMD-2076 induced strong tumor regression when administered orally in animal models of human tumors derived from leukemia, colon, and breast cancer cell lines with minimal toxicity.   
In a pre-clinical study using three different human HCC cell lines, (SMMC-7721, QGY-7703 
and HepG 2) were used to establish the tumor xenograft models in nude mice. After the inoculated tumors grew to more than 100 mm
3, mice were randomly assigned into one of the 
groups receiving vehicle, sorafenib, ENMD-2076 alone or in combination with chemotherapy agents, including doxorubicin or 5-FU, respectively, for 20 days. After commencing 
administration, dynamic measurement was performed every 3 days to determine the tumor sizes 
and body weights of the tumor-bearing mouse to assess tumor growth inhibition and adverse effects. In the SMMC-7721, QGY-7703 and HepG 2 xenograft models, ENMD-2076 induced tumor growth inhibition significantly greater (P<0.01 in all three models) than that of sorafenib.  The tumor growth inhibition rates in the ENMD-2076 treated groups were also significantly 
higher (P<0.01 in all three models) than those seen in the groups treated with doxorubicin and 5 
FU. These results show that ENMD-2076 demonstrated robust antitumor activity against three 
cell line-derived xenograft models of HCC, which is superior to that of sorafenib, doxorubicin, and 5FU, supporting clinical investigation of this agent in HCC patients who do not tolerate, or have failed or relapsed from other systemic treatment such as sorafenib, doxorubicin or 5 FU.  In clinical studies, clinical benefit has been observed with partial responses in one FLC patient, 
who relapsed from multiple treatments including TACE/doxorubicin, TACE/cisplatin, liver 
transplantation, and sorafenib. The patient was on ENMD-2076 for 18 4-week cycles while maintaining stable disease for 17 months.   There are, however, no first line systemic options available and few clinical trials currently under 
going to explore treatment of anti-angiogenic agents in FLC ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]).  The absence of current first line treatment options and the current anti-angiogenic clinical trial landscape make ENMD-2076 a viable candidate to potentially fill a currently unmet medical need in the treatment of FLC. 
 
In order to address the urgency of the needs, FDA encourage studies of drugs or biological 
products for diseases that are life-threatening or severely debilitating in pediatric patients and 
that lack adequate therapy could begin earlier than studies of other products, despite the relative 
lack of safety and effectiveness information. (FDA Guidance for Industry: How to Comply with 
the Pediatric Research Equity Act. September 2005)

Confidential    14 of 50 CASI Pharmaceuticals has submitted the study protocol to FDA and had a discussion about the 
study plan. FDA agreed the study dose regimen for the proposed age groups (12 years and above) with the current available pharmacokinetic and clinical data. FDA has granted orphan drug designation to ENMD-2076 for the FLC indication. 
 
This protocol will evaluate efficacy and safety of ENMD-2076 in patients with FLC.
 
4.3 Potential Risks and Benefits  
4.3.1 Risks of ENMD-2076 
As of April 2014, 210 cancer patients have been enrolled in clinical studies of ENMD-2076. The 
most frequent treatment-related AEs in the clinical studies in advanced cancer patients include hypertension, fatigue, nausea, diarrhea, dizziness/light-headedness, mucositis, and pruritis/rash. Serious adverse events included fatigue, hypertension, gallbladder pain, cholecystitis, elevated liver function tests, hyponatremia, dehydration, mucositis, gastrointestinal bleed, neutropenia, dyspnea, exacerbation of congestive heart failure, speech impairment/aphasia, and acute 
asymptomatic pancreatitis. Other events reported in Phase 2 include decreased platelets, 
hand/foot syndrome, ischemic colitis, and thyroiditis.   Refer to the Investigator’s Brochure for detailed safety information on the clinical and 
non-clinical studies. 
4.3.2 Potential Benefits 
It is unknown whether there will be an improvement of disease symptoms or survival in patients 
undergoing therapy with ENMD-2076. Patients who participate in this trial of ENMD-2076 will provide useful information that will guide its use in future patients with FLC. 
5. STUDY OBJECTIVES  
5.1 Primary Objective  
The primary objective of this trial is to determine the overall response rate using RECIST v 1.1 
criteria when patients with advanced fibrolamellar carcinoma (FLC) are treated with daily oral 
ENMD-2076. 
5.2 Secondary Objectives 
The secondary objectives are: 
• To evaluate the 6-month progression free survival (PS6) rate using RECIST v 1.1 criteria 
when patients with FLC are treated with daily oral ENMD-2076. 
• To evaluate the median Progression Free Survival (PFS), Time to Progression (TTP), and 
Overall Survival (OS). 
• To determine the safety of ENMD-2076 as defined by the frequency and severity of adverse events when patients with FLC are treated with daily oral ENMD-2076.

Confidential    15 of 50 • To explore biomarkers predictive of tumor response to ENMD-2076 in FLC patients 
 
5.3 Endpoints 
Revised RECIST criteria (version 1.1) as defined in Appendix C will be used to evaluate 
response. Response will be evaluated after every two cycles of treatment. Complete response (CR), partial response (PR), stable disease (SD), and progressive disease (PD) will be defined as outlined in the revised RECIST criteria, Appendix C and Section 6.3. SD is defined if the disease is stable on two measurements or longer, i.e. 4 treatment cycles or longer. Progression free 
survival (PFS) is defined as the time from the first day of treatment to the first observation of 
disease progression or death due to any cause or last follow-up. PFS will be censored for patients who are alive and free of progression at the time of last follow-up. Duration of overall response is measured from the time measurement criteria are first met for CR/PR (whichever is first recorded) until the first date that recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented 
(taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded on study). 
Patients who are removed from the study for reasons other than documented PD will be followed at 2 month intervals until study endpoint. 
6. INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
6.1 Overall Study Design and Plan – Description 
This is a Phase 2 multi-center, open label study in 29 FLC patients.  Patients will receive a daily oral dose (fasting) of ENMD-2076 as a single treatment agent. The starting dose will be based on 
body surface area.  If adverse events, two dose reductions at the discretion of the investigator 
will be allowed for each patient. If adverse events resolve, the dose can be increased in 50 mg 
increments as tolerated.  Dosing interruptions/delays will be allowed at the discretion of the 
investigator for recovery from adverse events or inter-current illness, particularly if the patient is 
benefiting from ENMD-2076 treatment. After a treatment interruption for adverse events, 
treatment can be resumed at a lower dose and increased in 50 mg increments as tolerated.  
Patients may be treated until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Once a potential patient has been identified and signed the informed consent form, the screening and baseline visit procedures will be completed.  Following the baseline visits, patients meeting all study entry criteria will start Cycle 1 and get their first dose of ENMD-2076. Each cycle of 
treatment consists of a 4-week treatment period. Patients who complete the initial cycle of 
therapy (4 weeks of treatment) without evidence of significant toxicity or clinical evidence of progressive disease may receive additional 4-week cycles of treatment.   Patients who discontinue therapy for any reason other than progression will continue to receive imaging until progression or death.  All recruited subjects will be followed for safety and overall 
survival.

Group(s)  
The primary objective of this trial is to determine the overall response rate using RECIST v 1.1 
criteria when patients with advanced fibrolamellar carcinoma (FLC) are treated with daily oral 
ENMD-2076. Since there is no standard therapy approved to treat patients with FLC, it is appropriate for this evaluation to be conducted as a single arm, open label, non-controlled study.    The interim analysis with the initial 16 patients is to establish proof of concept before expanding 
the treatment to the full planned population of patients.

• Safety data will be collected from time of informed consent through study completion /withdrawal up to 30 days after the last dose of study medication by each subject. 
8.2.1 Objective Tumor Responses/Benefit Assessments 
Tumor responses in patients will be determined by the RECIST guidelines (version 1.1) defined 
in Appendix C.  In the absence of significant treatment-related toxicity or clinical evidence of 
progressive disease, patients will be allowed to continue on 4-week cycles of ENMD-2076.  The 
frequency and timing of the assessment of tumor burden/clinical benefit are described in Table 4.  
Unscheduled benefit assessments may be conducted when clinically indicated during the study. 
•  
8.2.2 Guidelines for Evaluation of Measurable Disease and Response 
Guidelines for evaluation of measurable disease and response are outlined in Section 4 of Appendix C.  
The same modality of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize each 
identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow-up.  Imaging-based evaluation should always be done rather than clinical examination unless the lesion(s) being followed cannot be imaged but are assessable by clinical exam.  
Details regarding method of assessment (i.e., CT scan) are outlined in Section 3.2.2 of Appendix 
C. 
8.3 Safety Variables  
Safety will be evaluated by collecting information on adverse events and by routine assessments.  
All adverse events will be graded using the NCI CTCAE version 4.0 and recorded in the CRF.   
Specific safety assessments include the following: 
• Treatment emergent AEs graded according to NCI CTCAE v4. The frequency and 
severity of AEs will be evaluated following administration of oral ENMD-2076

8.3.1 Clinical Laboratory 
Non-fasting blood and urine specimens for the measurement and evaluation of clinical 
chemistry, hematology/coagulation, urinalysis, and pregnancy hormones (female patients with 
childbearing potential) will be collected as described in Table 2.  Approximately 20 mL of blood 
will be collected for the clinical laboratory assessments at the specified times.  Serum pregnancy tests will be performed as described inTable 4.  A positive pregnancy test prior to dosing will exclude the patient from enrolment in the study.  See Section 8.3.7 for requirements regarding 
pregnancies during the study.  Values for the following parameters will be obtained:

Confidential    26 of 50 8.3.2 Medical History and Physical Examination 
As part of the physical examination, a medical history will be taken with particular attention to 
(1) a review of the body systems, including diagnosis of malignancy; and (2) use of prescription medications, including prior chemotherapy and corticosteroids, and nonprescription medications.   
Physical examination findings within the following categories will be assessed:  
 ! HEENT 
! pulmonary 
! cardiovascular 
! GI/abdomen 
! extremities 
! neurological 
! skin and hair  
! weight  
 The Screening Visit will also include measurement of height. 
8.3.3 Standard 12-lead Electrocardiograms (ECGs) 
A standard 12 Lead ECG will be performed at the times described in Table 4.  In the case of an 
abnormal ECG, the ECG should be repeated to rule out machine error or improper placement of leads and reviewed by a local cardiologist.  Any abnormality determined to be clinically significant by the Investigator should be discussed with the Medical Monitor prior to enrolment 
of the patient.  
 Any ECGs deemed abnormal by the Investigator may be over read by a cardiologist to make a determination of clinical significance.  In some cases, it may be appropriate to repeat abnormal ECGs to rule out improper lead placement as contributing to the ECG abnormality.  It is 
important that leads are placed in the same positions each time in order to achieve precise ECG 
recordings. 
8.3.4 Vital Signs 
Vital signs include systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and body 
temperature.  These parameters will be measured as described in Table 4.  Vital sign 
measurements will be conducted after several minutes in the sitting position. 
8.3.5 ECOG Performance Status 
The Investigator will assess each patient’s functional status using the ECOG Performance Status 
Scale at the time points identified inTable 4.  Eligible patients must have an ECOG Performance Status of 0 to 2 at screening (see Appendix B). 
8.3.6 Adverse Events 
8.3.6.1 Adverse Events (AE) and Serious Adverse Events  (SAE) 
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject participating in a clinical 
trial. An adverse event can be any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom or disease

Version 8. 1  Sept 14, 2015 
______________________________________________________________________________ 
 
Confidential    27 of 50 temporally associated with the use of the study medication, whether or not considered related to 
the study medication. AEs will be collected from the start of treatment until 30 days following the final visit dose.  Any events occurring prior to treatment will be recorded on the medical history page with the event name and onset date and end date if not continuing.  Pre-existing, 
known clinically significant conditions observed at screening should be recorded as medical 
history.  This definition also includes accidental injuries, reasons for any change in medication (drug and/or dose) other than planned titration, reasons for admission to a hospital, or reasons for 
surgical procedures (unless for minor elective surgery for a pre-existing condition). It also 
includes adverse events commonly observed and adverse events anticipated based on the pharmacological effect of the study medication.  Any new laboratory abnormality assessed as clinically significant by the Investigator must be recorded as an adverse event.   
A treatment emergent adverse event is any adverse event occurring after start of study 
medication and within the time of residual drug effect, or a pre-treatment adverse event or pre-existing medical condition that worsens in intensity after start of study medication and within the time of residual drug effect.   
Adverse events should be recorded as diagnoses, if available. If not, separate sign(s) and 
symptom(s) are recorded. One diagnosis/symptom should be entered per record.   Note that death is not an event, but the cause of death is. An exception is the event of sudden death of unknown cause. Note that hospitalization is not an event; however, the reason for hospitalization is. Procedures are not events; the reasons for conducting the procedures are. In 
general, only the reason for conducting the procedure will be captured as an adverse event. 
However, if deemed necessary by the Investigator, a procedure can be captured along with the reason for conducting the procedure.  An overdose or medication error is not an adverse event unless it is temporally associated with 
an unfavourable or unintended sign or symptom.   
 Each AE is to be classified by the investigator as serious or non-serious.  A serious adverse event  (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence or effect that occurs at any dose:   
• Results in death 
• Is life-threatening (i.e., an immediate risk of death) 
• Requires in-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization 
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity 
• Is associated with a congenital anomaly/birth defect 
• Is an important medical event

Version 8. 1  Sept 14, 2015 
______________________________________________________________________________ 
 
Confidential    28 of 50 An adverse event caused by an overdose or medication error is considered serious if a criterion 
listed in the definition above is fulfilled.  Important adverse events that may not result in death, may not be life-threatening, or do not 
require hospitalization may be considered serious when, based upon appropriate medical 
judgment, they may jeopardize the subject’s safety or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.  Serious adverse events also include any other event that the investigator or sponsor judges to be 
serious or which is defined as serious by the regulatory agency. 
 The investigator is to report all directly observed adverse events and all adverse events spontaneously reported by the trial subject using concise medical terminology.  In addition, each trial subject will be questioned about adverse events.  The question asked will be “Since you 
began taking the study medication, have you had any health problems?” 
 
8.3.6.2 Clinical Laboratory Abnormalities and Other Abnormal Assessments 
It is the responsibility of the Investigator to assess the clinical significance of all abnormal 
laboratory values. The Investigator will exercise medical judgment in deciding whether abnormal laboratory values are clinically significant and represent AEs.  In some cases, significant changes 
within the range of normal will require similar judgment by the Investigator. 
 If an abnormal laboratory value or assessment is clearly related to a medically defined diagnosis or syndrome, the diagnosis or syndrome will be recorded on the AE page, not the individual laboratory values.  Clinically significant abnormal laboratory values should not be listed on the 
AE page of the eCRF, unless clinical signs or symptoms are present.  
 All clinically significant abnormal laboratory results or assessments will be followed until they return to normal or become stabilized (up to 30 days after end of study drug administration). 
8.3.6.3 Procedures for Assessing, Recording, and Reporting Adverse Events 
and Serious Adverse Events 
Throughout the duration of the study, the Investigator will closely monitor each subject for 
evidence of drug intolerance and for the development of clinical or laboratory evidence of adverse events.  All adverse events (expected or unexpected) which occur during the course of the study, whether observed by the Investigator or by the subject, and whether or not thought to 
be drug-related, will be reported and followed until resolution or until they become stable. 
The Investigator will evaluate AEs according to the following guidelines: 
• NCI CTCAE Version 4.0.  The Investigator must assign a CTC Grade for each AE 
(Appendix A) 
• Description of event (if the event consists of a cluster of signs and symptoms, a diagnosis 
must be recorded [e.g., flu syndrome] rather than each sign and symptom)

Confidential    29 of 50 • Onset Date  
• Stop Date  
• Seriousness (see definition of SAEs, Section 8.3.6.1)  
The Investigator must record whether or not the AE meets the definition of serious.  If the 
event is serious, the Investigator must complete a Serious Adverse Event report form (see 
Section 8.3.6.4).  CASI Pharmaceuticals or designee will monitor the completeness and 
accuracy of these forms. 
• Relationship to Study Medication 
The Investigator must assess the relationship between the AE and the study medication as 
either not related or having a possible, probable, or definite relationship to the study 
medication.  
• Outcome 
Outcome of AEs should be recorded based on the status of the AE at discontinuation from 
the study (includes 30 days post last dose) as resolved, resolved with sequelae, ongoing or 
death.  If an AE is not resolved at the time of discontinuation, the AE should be followed until resolution (return to normal or baseline values) or until judged by the Investigator to be no longer clinically significant. 
• Action Taken (None, AE Required Treatment, Temporarily Interrupted or Permanent 
Discontinuation of Study Medication) 
• Patient Status (i.e., Was patient prematurely discontinued due to AE?) 
Events will be coded into one of the following causality categories as defined below: 
Category Definition 
Unrelated Clearly and incontrovertibly due only to extraneous causes, and does 
not meet criteria listed under possible or probable. 
Unlikely Does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence from administration. 
May have been produced by the subject’s clinical state or by 
environmental factors or other therapies administered. 
Possible Follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration, but 
may have been also produced by the subject’s clinical state, 
environmental factors or other therapies administered. 
Probable Clear-cut temporal association with administration with improvement 
on cessation of investigational medicinal product or reduction in dose. Reappears upon rechallenge. Follows a known pattern of 
response to the investigational medicinal product. 
 
Adverse events with the causality assessed as unrelated or unlikely are categorized as not related to study medication.

8.3.6.4 Reporting of Serious Adverse Events  
An AE that is serious or potentially serious requires the following additional detailed reports and 
follow-up and should be recorded in the CRF.  The content of these detailed reports should 
address the Investigator’s (or in some cases, the Sponsor’s) estimate of causality, and whether or 
not the AE is identified in nature, severity, and frequency in the Investigator’s Brochure or in 
other risk information that has been supplied to the Investigator.  Sponsor Notification 
Any SAE that occurs after starting study drug administration must be reported to the Clinical Study Monitor or Project Manager as soon as information is available.  In turn, the Clinical Study Monitor/Project Manager must immediately inform the Medical Monitor of the event and document the notification in a telephone/contact report.  The urgency for reporting a SAE is 
three-fold:  (1) to facilitate discussion (and implementation, if necessary) by the Sponsor and the 
Investigator of appropriate follow-up measures; (2) to facilitate Investigator reporting of unanticipated problems involving risk to human patients to the IRB/REB; and (3) to enable the Sponsor to fulfil the requirements to the appropriate regulatory authority.  
Any non-fatal or non-life-threatening SAE, regardless of expectedness or causality, or fatal or 
life-threatening SAE must be immediately reported to the Clinical Study Monitor or Project Manager by telephone or facsimile, and a written report (Serious AE Report Form) signed by the Investigator must be provided to the Clinical Study Monitor or Project Manager promptly, but no later than the timelines outlined in Table .  This documentation will be forwarded to the Medical 
Monitor immediately to facilitate the prompt detection by the Medical Monitor of any changes in 
the nature, severity, or frequency of serious AEs, and allow the Sponsor to meet reporting requirements of the appropriate regulatory agency.

**The time period for notification of an SAE begins when the Investigator or any site personnel obtains 
knowledge of the event.  
 
Institutional Review Board Notification 
The Investigator must also promptly notify the IRB/REB of the SAE, including any follow-up 
information in accordance with local institutional policy. 
 
If a given SAE is associated with the study medication and is unexpected, CASI Pharmaceuticals will forward an Investigational New Drug application (IND) Safety Report to the regulatory authorities and to the Investigator(s).  In accordance with FDA regulations, it is the Investigator’s responsibility to promptly inform the IRB/REB of the IND Safety Report. 
 
Significant or Unexpected Toxicities 
CASI Pharmaceuticals, the Medical Monitor, and the involved Investigator will monitor the safety experience of all patients treated.  Significant or unexpected toxicities that, in the judgment of the Investigator, the Sponsor, or the Medical Monitor, presents an unacceptable 
consequence or risk to the patient will result in discontinuation of the patient from further study 
participation.  The Investigator will notify CASI Pharmaceuticals immediately of any significant or unexpected toxicities.  The Investigator, CASI Pharmaceuticals, or the Medical Monitor will notify other investigators and all institutional review committees of important or unexpected toxicity.  Treatment may be delayed to allow recovery from treatment-related toxicities and to 
consider if dose reductions are appropriate for continued therapy with ENMD-2076.  A delay of 
up to 3 weeks is allowed for patients to return to baseline or Grade 1 from any treatment-related side effect.  Treatment delays for events such as intercurrent illnesses will be discussed with the Investigator and Medical Monitor to determine if a patient may remain on study if a delay of more than two weeks is required. 
 
Post Study Adverse Events 
Investigators are not obligated to actively seek information on AEs or SAEs in former study participants who completed the end of study visit.  However, the Investigator should promptly notify CASI Pharmaceuticals, or designee, if the Investigator learns of any SAE or death of a 
study patient within 30 days after a patient has discontinued study drug administration, and such 
event(s) is (are) reasonably related to the study medication. Investigators should promptly notify CASI Pharmaceuticals, or designee, if they become aware of a former study participant who is one of the parents of a subsequently conceived child with a congenital anomaly (see below). 
8.3.6.5 Follow -up of Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events and Other 
Investigations 
All SAEs must be followed until they are resolved (return to normal or baseline values), 
stabilized, or the patient is lost to follow-up and cannot be contacted.  Supplemental measurements and/or evaluations may be necessary to fully investigate the nature and/or

or consultation with other healthcare professionals.  If the patient dies during the study or within 30 days following the End of Study Drug Administration/Discontinuation, any postmortem findings (including histopathology) must be provided to CASI Pharmaceuticals, or designee.  
CRF data should be updated with any new information as appropriate. 
8.3.7 Pregnancy Information 
A serum pregnancy test will be performed on females to determine pregnancy status at the time 
points outlined inTable 4.  If any female patient becomes pregnant while enrolled in the clinical trial, she will be withdrawn immediately.  Any dispensed study medication must be returned to the clinical site.  The Investigator must notify CASI Pharmaceuticals or designee by telephone 
within 24 hours of learning about the pregnancy.  The Investigator must diligently follow the 
patient until delivery or termination of the pregnancy, providing necessary updated information to CASI Pharmaceuticals or designee.  Generally, follow-up will occur within six to eight weeks following the estimated delivery date.  Any premature termination of the pregnancy will also be reported.  
Although pregnancy occurring in a clinical trial is not considered to be an AE or SAE, any 
pregnancy complication or elective termination of a pregnancy for medical reasons will be recorded as an AE or SAE and will be followed as such.  A spontaneous abortion is always considered to be an SAE.

A detailed time and event schedule is provided inTable 4.  Time 0 is defined as the precise time of the first ENMD-2076 administration on Day 1.  All other time points in this study are relative to these definitions.  Screening Period (Day -28 to Day 1): 
Prior to the initiation of any protocol-specific screening assessments not generally performed as part of routine patient care; the patient must be given a complete explanation of the purpose and evaluations of the study.  Subsequently, the patient must sign and receive a copy of an Informed Consent Form that was approved by the IRB.  Once informed consent has been obtained, the eligibility of the patient will be determined, and Screening Period assessments will be performed. 
 
Treatment Period (before dosing on Day 1 up to Day 28): 
On Day 1 before the initiation of the treatment, patients will be evaluated and baseline values for 
the specific assessments will be obtained.  Thereafter during the initial Treatment Period, 
patients will visit the clinic for evaluation of tolerability, safety, and efficacy.  Evaluation visits will be scheduled as described inTable 4.

Confidential    37 of 50 9.1 Study Periods  
9.1.1 Screening Period (Days –28 to –1) 
Prior to performing any study procedures, the Investigator, or designee, will obtain written 
informed consent from the patient as described in Section 3.3.  The patient’s consent must be 
confirmed at the time of signature by the dated signature of the person conducting the informed consent discussions.  A copy of the signed consent document must be given to the patient or the patient’s legally authorized representative.  “Legally authorized representative” means an individual or judicial or other body authorized under applicable law to consent on behalf of a prospective patient to the patient’s participation in the procedure(s) involved in the research.  
The Investigator will retain the original signed consent document. 
  The specific Screening assessments are described in Section 8.  Results of all assessments/evaluations must be acceptable to the Investigator and to the Sponsor or their designee prior to treatment with study medication.   
 
When all screening results are completed and eligibility is confirmed, the patient will be assigned a patient identification number. 
9.1.2 Treatment Period 
The assessments to be performed during the Treatment Period are described in Section 8 and the 
timing of the assessments is provided inTable 4.  Assessments at each clinic visit following Day 
1 must be completed within ±3 days of the indicated visit day for Cycle 1 and each monthly visit 
(Cycle 2+) must be completed within ±7 days of the indicated visit cycle (4-weeks).  
9.1.3 End of Cycle 6 Assessment Time point 
All patients will have radiographic assessments of their disease at 6 months/180 days unless CT 
scan has previously documented progression of their disease.  For patients who are continuing to receive study drug at this time point, this radiographic assessment may be combined with their regular visit and list of assessments for the cycle. 
9.1.4 End of Study Drug Administration Visit 
End of study drug administration assessments will be completed for each patient as indicated 
inTable 4.  
9.2 Study Procedures 
 
9.2.1 Pharmacokinetic analysis 
 
Blood samples will be drawn from all the patients enrolled prior to the dosing at Day 1, Day 8 and Day 15 (steady state) of Cycle 1, and day 1 of Cycle 2, and Cycle 3, respectively as outlined in Table 4.

Confidential    38 of 50 4 mL blood will be collected in tubes containing heparin sodium. Following blood collection, 
samples will be cooled in an ice bath and centrifuged (at approximately 1500 rpm for 10 minutes) under refrigeration at a temperature of approximately 4°C within 30 minutes of collection. Plasma samples will be divided into2 aliquots of approximately equal volume and 
stored in suitably labelled tubes at -80±15°C (within 45 minutes of blood sample collection), 
pending assay. Samples will remain in an ice bath until placement in a freezer. Plasma samples will be retained and plasma concentrations of ENMD-2076 and its major active metabolite ENMD-2060 will be analysed.  The effects of gender, age, body weight and CLcr 
(creatinine clearance) on the steady state plasma concentrations will be evaluated to explore the 
drug’s exposure-response relationships.  
(A manual for the Pharmacokinetic analysis will be provided)  
9.2.2 Tissue biomarker analysis: 
Formalin-fixed paraffin embedded archival surgical tumor tissue samples obtained from patients 
will be used for immunohistochemical analysis of key markers of proliferation (phospho-histone H3 [pHH3], Ki67), tumour microvessels (CD31) and p53. Following paraffin removal and 
subsequent rehydration of sections 5 lm thick, antigen retrieval is performed by incubating slides 
for 10 min at 100 
oC in 10 mM sodium citrate, pH 6.0 (p53, pHH3, Ki67) or 10 mM Tris, 1 mM 
ethylene diamine tetra-acetic acid (EDTA), pH9 (CD31). Slides are blocked in 10% donkey serum in phosphate buffered solution (PBS) for 1 h then incubated for 1 h with primary antibody diluted in 2% donkey serum-PBS. Antibodies and dilutions to be used are as follows: p53 mouse 
monoclonal clone DO-1 (1:2000), Santa Cruz; pHH3 (Ser10) mouse monoclonal (1:1000), Cell 
Signalling; Ki67 mouse monoclonal clone MIB-1 (1:200), Dako; CD31 mouse monoclonal clone JC70A (1:500), Dako.   Slides are incubated overnight with biotin conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG (Jackson 
ImmunoResearch, 1:200), followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated 
streptavidin (Jackson, 1:200) for 1 h. After washing in PBS, slides are developed with 3,3’ diaminobenzidine (Dako), followed by counterstaining with haematoxylin (Dako). All slides are digitally scanned using the ScanScope XT brightfield scanner (Aperio Technologies), with an 
Olympus 20 X/0.75NA objective lens (resolution 0.5 microns/pixel). Images are visualized 
and analyzed using ImageScope (Aperio). Cells positive for pHH3 and Ki67 staining are counted 
using the accompanying Nuclear_v9 algorithm. The CD31 microvessel density (MVD) count is determined by locating three CD31- dense hotspots in each section and counting the number of 
CD31-positive loci in a high-power field area for each hotspot, then representing the average as 
number of microvessels (MV) per mm
2. 
 The tissue should be shipped to Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center for subsequent biomarker studies and possibly other research.. 
9.2.3 Genomic testing 
Paraffin embedded tumor tissue sections and one whole blood sample will be collected and 
processed for a 410 gene panel DNA sequencing analyses. The treatment and preservation of

Confidential    39 of 50 tumor tissue will follow the routine operation procedures in pathology . Tissue blocks with high 
levels of tumor cells should be selected (weight 100~500 mg, diameter >5 mm). At least 15-20 
unstained and charged slides should be provided, with a thickness of 10µm, along with one HE stained paraffin sections with a thickness of 5µm. Slides should be cut from the same source. The predicted tumor cells should be more than 50%. The tissue section samples will be shipped to MSKCC after collection for further testing and analysis. The tumor cell DNA will be extracted, sequenced and analyzed based on standard operational procedures at the MSKCC research laboratory. One whole blood sample should be collected in a 3mL EDTA lavender top tube and send to MSKCC. MSKCC’s Center of Molecular Oncology will run its Integrated Mutation Profiling of Actionable Cancer Targets (IMPACT) battery of 410 cancer genes on all samples provided. This information will be collected for research purposes only. 
 
9.2.4 Tumor biopsy: 
Tumor biopsies will be performed as per local institutional guidelines.  Tumor biopsy (optional) 
baseline up to 30 days prior to initiation of dosing if patient had a biopsy after any previous 
treatments, they would be exempt of this biopsy  and at the end of treatment Cycle 2 (or Day 1 
of cycle 3) in line with the imaging for tumor measurement  An additional optional biopsy at the 
time of disease progression will be performed in patients who have complete response, partial response or stable disease for > 16 weeks.   If either the baseline or post-treatment biopsy is unable to be obtained due to technical issues (after consenting the patient and making a 
reasonable effort), the patient is still eligible to participate in the study.  A third optional biopsy 
will take place at the time of disease progression for patients who have complete response, partial response, or stable disease for > 16 weeks. Biopsy samples obtained pre- or after 
treatment will also be used for biomarker analysis using immunohistochemistry methods as described above. For tissue biopsy, multiple strips that are sufficient for biomarker study should be provided.  
A 3mL blood sample will be collected at each time the biopsy is performed. The blood will be 
drawn in an EDTA tube and MSKCC’s Center of Molecular Oncology will run the sample on its Integrated Mutation Profiling of Actionable Cancer Targets (IMPACT) battery of 410 cancer genes. The sample may also be used to identify predictive biomarkers of response, sensitivity and clinical benefit to ENMD-2076.   Tumor biopsy for minor patients will only occur if medically indicated and not solely for research purposes.  If available, a sample of tumor tissue from any surgical resection or biopsy during treatment or at time of progression will be requested for biomarker and genomic testing 
on this study. The biopsy after cycle 2 and the optional biopsy at completion of therapy only 
refers to patients 18 years of age or older.  (A manual for the Pathology tissue and Tumor biopsy will be provided)

10.1 Subject Populations  
All enrolled patients who receive at least one dose of study medication will constitute the safety 
population.  The safety population will be used for all demographic and baseline characteristics analyses and for all safety analyses.    
The per-protocol population will include all evaluable patients in the safety population who do 
not have a major protocol deviation.  Efficacy assessments will be analyzed for the safety and per-protocol population.  The analysis on the safety population should be considered primary. 
10.2 Subject Disposition 
This study is an open-label trial; patients will be allowed to continue study drug treatment until disease progression or toxicity occurs.  Patients will remain on study for at least 6 months/180 days.  No interim analysis or data safety monitoring beyond that described above will be conducted for this study. 
10.3 Demographics and Baseline Characteristics  
Demographics and baseline characteristics of subjects will be summarized with descriptive 
statistics. 
10.4 Efficacy Analysis  
 
We have designed this study using a Simon’s Optimal two-stage design to allow for an early 
interim analysis to determine potential futility and an overall final analysis with criteria 
established to allow for sufficient power and type 1 error rate to provide results to support a submission of the study as a pivotal trial.     For the primary endpoint, the overall response rate will be examined using the RECIST v 1.1 
criteria.  Patients will first be examined in one of 4 categories – CR, PR, SD, PD (Complete 
response, Partial Response, Stable Disease, or Progressive disease, respectively).  Next, patients 
will be dichotomized as responders (CR/PR versus non-responders). The null hypothesis that the true response rate is 2% will be tested against a one-sided alternative that the true response rate is 15%. In the first stage, 16 patients will have reached study endpoints of response s per RECIST 1.1 criteria after two cycles of treatment. If there are zero responses in these 16 patients, the 
study will be stopped. Otherwise, 13 additional patients will be accrued for a total of 29. The null 
hypothesis will be rejected if 2 or more responses are observed in 29 patients. This design yields a type I error rate of 9.4% and power of 90% when the true response rate is 15%. The probability of early termination due to drug inefficacy is 72%.  
After the primary efficacy analysis is performed, a one-sided 95% confidence interval will be 
calculated using the Clopper-Pearson exact method for the response rate.  This will determine the

Confidential    42 of 50 lower bound for the response rate.  If 2 or more patients respond out of 29 then the lower bound 
will exceed 1.2% providing evidence that the drug is active (i.e. ruling out 0% response). For each of the secondary endpoints, exploratory analyses will be performed.  Progression Free Survival rate at 6 months (PFS6) and three time-to-event measures will be calculated. Time to 
Progression, progression free survival and overall survival.  A Kaplan-Meier survival plot will be 
calculated for each of these measures and median time to event (i.e. survival) will be calculated for each measure. 
10.5 Safety Analysis  
Safety will be assessed by evaluation of adverse events and clinical laboratory results. 
10.5.1 Adverse Events 
Adverse events will be coded to system organ class and preferred term using MedDRA version 
16.0 or higher.  All adverse events occurring after the initiation of the study treatment (treatment emergent adverse events) will be reported, including events present at baseline that worsened during the study. 
 
Adverse events will be summarized by treatment group to provide visual comparison among the treatment groups with respect to incidence of adverse events (the number of subjects reporting at least one episode of a specific adverse event), incidence of adverse events by severity within body system, incidence of adverse events by attribution within body system, and incidence of 
adverse events causing withdrawal and incidence of serious adverse events.  Regarding severity 
and attribution summaries, the most extreme outcome (highest severity and closest to study drug related) will be used for those subjects who experience the same adverse event on more than one occasion.   
Written narratives will be provided for all serious, unexpected or other significant adverse events 
that are judged to be of special interest because of their clinical importance. 
10.5.2 Clinical Laboratory 
Clinical laboratory results will be summarized with descriptive statistics at baseline each study 
timepoint and with shifts from baseline.

10.6 Source Data and Records  
Source data are all the information in original records and certified copies of original records of 
clinical findings, observations, laboratory reports, data sheets provided by the sponsor or other 
activities in the study, which are necessary for the reconstruction and evaluation of the study. 
The investigator will permit study-related monitoring, audit(s), IRB review(s) and regulatory 
inspection(s), with direct access to all the required source records. 
All study records will be retained for a period of time as defined by the regulatory authority and 
per ICH E6 section 4.9 for the country in which the investigation is conducted.  Generally, this 
means at least 2 years following the date on which the drug is approved by the regulatory 
authority for marketing for the purposes that were the subject of the investigation.  In other 
situations (e.g., where the investigation is not in support of or as part of an application for a 
research or marketing permit), a period of 2 years following the date on which the entire clinical program is completed, terminated or discontinued or the investigational application under which 
the investigation is being conducted is terminated or withdrawn by the regulatory authorities. 
In the event the Investigator retires, relocates or for any other reason withdraws from the 
responsibility for maintaining records for the period of time required, custody of the records may 
be transferred to any other person who will accept responsibility for the records.  Notice of such 
a transfer must be given in writing to the Sponsor.  The Investigator must contact the Sponsor 
prior to disposal of any records related to this study.  
10.7 Reporting of Results  
The Case Report Form (CRF) is an integral part of the study and subsequent reports.  The CRF 
must be used to capture all study data recorded in the patient’s medical record.  The CRF must 
be kept current to reflect patient status during the course of the study.  Only a patient screening and randomization number and patient initials will be used to identify the patient.    The monitor is responsible for performing on-site monitoring at regular intervals throughout the 
study to verify adherence to the protocol; verify adherence to local regulations on the conduct of 
clinical research; and ensure completeness, accuracy, and consistency of the data entered in the CRF.  CASI Pharmaceuticals, Inc. or a designated CRO will monitor completed Case Report Forms 
(CRFs).  A case report form will be provided for each screened patient.  All protocol-required information collected during the study must be entered by the Investigator, 
or designated representative, in paper CRF or the Target e*CRF™, an Internet-based electronic 
data collection system, which is 21CFR Part 11 compliant..  All details of the CRF completion 
and correction will be explained to the investigator.  The management module of Target 
e*CRF™ , if used, includes edit check and query systems that seamlessly integrate with the data

Confidential    44 of 50 entry system.  All modifications to the data in the eCRF are tracked by an electronic audit trail 
(date and identity of the person making the change are instantaneously recorded). The actual date (and time, if applicable) of each assessment should always be entered in the CRFs  If the Investigator authorizes other persons to make entries in the CRF, the names, positions, and 
signatures of these persons must be indicated on the Site Delegation Log. 
 The Investigator, or designated representative, should complete the eCRF as soon as possible after information is collected, preferably on the same day that a study patient is seen for an examination, treatment, or any other study procedure.  Any outstanding entries must be 
completed immediately after the final examination.  By design, an explanation must be provided 
for all missing data, altered data, and/or out of range data.  The completed case report form must be reviewed and signed by the Investigator named in the study protocol or by a designated sub investigator after all the data was monitored and verified as 
final by the designated study monitor. 
 Final monitored and audited CRFs will be provided by the Sponsor to the sites at the end of the study in the format of a PDF file. 
10.8 Confid entiality of Subject Data  
The investigator will ensure that the confidentiality of the subjects' data will be preserved. In the CRF or any other documents submitted to the sponsor, the subjects will not be identified by their names, but by an identification system, which consists of their initials and number in the study. The investigator will maintain documents not meant for submission to the sponsor, e.g., the 
confidential subject identification code and the signed informed consent forms, in strict 
confidence.

SYNOPSIS  
Study Title  The ORION Trial - Metoprolol to Reduce Per ioperative Myocardial I njury 
Objective s a) Determine the efficacy and safety of titrated postoperative beta -blocker therapy to 
reduce myocardial injury.  
b) Determine the clinical utility of pre -operative high-sensitivity cardiac troponin 
levels for identifying patients who may benefit from postoperative beta -blocker 
therapy . 
Hypothes es 1) In patients with high cardiovascular risk undergoing major, non -cardiac surgery, 
postoperative therapy with the beta-blocker metoprolol will significantly reduce 
postoperative myocardial injury without causing clinically significant hypotension.   
2) Postoperative β-blocker therapy is more effective in patients with elevated 
preoperative hs -cTn (“high -risk”- patients).

 1. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
Perioperative adverse cardiac events are a significant public health concern. Often referred to as a “hidden 
epidemic”, perioperative adverse cardiac events kill twice as many Americans per year as all motor vehicle deaths 
combined (2011: 32,367 motor vehicle deaths compared to an estimated 63,000 postoperative cardiac deaths after non-cardiac surgery).
6 Despite the substantial incidence and associated mortality of perioperative adverse cardiac 
events, few recommended preventive therapies exist. In fact, th ere is currently no medical treatment that can be 
recommended for the prevention of perioperative adverse cardiac events based on robust scientific evidence. 
Preoperative β-blocker therapy has become highly controversial (the new 2014 AHA guidelines no lon ger 
recommend preoperative β -blockers for the majority of patients).8,9 Perioperative statin therapy has nearly 
exclusively been explored in retrospective studies,42-44 and the only randomized controlled trial in patients 
undergoing non-cardiac surgery was performed by the same group whose research has been questioned for 
potential misconduct.45 Two recent large clinical trials showed that neither clonidine (an α2 adrenergic agonist; 
hazard ratio [HR] 1.08, 95% CI 0.93 –  1.26) nor aspirin (HR 0.99, 95% CI 0.86 -1.15) , prevent perioperative 
adverse cardiac events.  Thus, there is currently no evidence -based treatment for prevention of perioperative 
adverse cardiac events and therefore the critical unmet need to identify such treatment that is both safe and 
effective.  
This research is significant because it studies an important public health problem and provides a potential 
treatment option to the vexing problem of perioperative β -blocker therapy. If successful, our novel approach 
would translate into approximately 1 in  4 postoperative MIs prevented and approximately 15,000 lives saved each 
year without increasing the risk of stroke and death in the general U.S. surgical population (assuming a similar 
effectiveness as seen in the POISE trial: absolute risk reduction from  5.1% to 3.6%, relative risk reduction ~30%, 
number needed to treat = 66 to prevent one MI).  
2. STUDY METHODS  
2.1 Study Design Summary  
This is a multi-center  (University of Chicago Medicine [USA]; The Alfred Health [Australia]) , double -blind 
clinical trial that will randomize  600 patients with CAD (or at high risk for CAD ), and undergoing major non-
cardiac surgery , to postoperative metoprolol tartrate  or placebo. All patients will be beta -blocker naïve for at least 
30 days prior to surgery and be randomized 1:1 to receive metoprolol tartrate  or placebo. Patients will receive up 
to 3 IV doses of study drug (placebo or IV metoprolol tartrate  5mg) prior to extu bation , and subsequently an oral 
dose (placebo or 25mg metoprolol tartrate ) in the post -operative unit , and then oral dosing at approx. every 8 
hours thereafter  through postop day 3  (72 hrs).  From arrival in the preop holding area through up to 72 hours 
postop or end of study treatment  (whichever occurs first) , patients will be continuously monitored with Holter 
ECG, a mobile hemodynamic monitor  (VisiMobile) , daily follow -up visits to include  12-lead ECG, and blood 
collections for serial cardiac biomarkers for high-sensitivity troponin . Primary efficacy endpoints are myocardial 
ischemia a nd myocardial injury as determined by ST -depression/elevation on 12 -lead ECG, and hs -cTn elevation. 
Primary safety endpoint is clinically relevant hypotension. Secondary outcomes include major adverse cardiac 
events, stroke, and 30- day and 1-year mortality . 
Due to feasibility and accessibility restrictions, The Alfred Health (TAH), will not be using the continuous monitoring device (VisiMobile ), nor will it use any form of continuous telemetry for ECG recording. However, 
Page 7 of 21 
 all other methods of data collection and monitoring will be done, including a daily stat 12-lead ECG recording, 
blood draws, and other information determining the patients’ recovery progress during hospital admission.  
The aim of the ORION trial is to compare the use of post -operative metoprolol to placebo for efficacy 
(myocardial ischemia and myocardial injury) and safety (clinically relevant hypotension) outcomes in Beta -
blocker naïve patients with high cardiac risk undergoing elective, major , non-cardiac surgery  with general 
anesthesia.  
Additional sites may be added to the study at a later date to also assist in recruitment, Ethics committee approval 
will be obtained then from each, but no data/samples will be shared until that approval and/or agreements have 
been confirmed.  
Additional Australian sites include:  
Fiona Stanley  
Dandenong  
Geelong Hospital  
Waikato

2.2.3 Screening and Enrollment  
Screening and recruitment at  UCM Anesthesia Perioperative Medicine Clinic (APMC) , which conducts 
preoperative visits for approx. 19 -35 patients/ day; or during a  preoperative stay in the hospital  for eligible 
inpatients . The purpose of the APMC is to perform standardized assessments prior to surgery. .Pre-screening will 
be conducted by coordinator review of the APMC schedule to identify patients who meet the criteria for age, 
eligible surgical procedure, and planned general anesthesia.  If a patient is deemed eligible, the patient’s medical 
history will be further evaluated by review of  the electronic medical record ( EMR ) to apply inclusion and 
exclusion criteria. Eligible patients will be approached in APMC  by a study team member who will discuss study 
aims , procedures, risks, and benefits of participation . 
The screening and recruitment plan at TAH will be approved and in accordance with their local Ethics 
Committee; while following institutional guidelines regarding research  patient enrollment in a pre -operative 
clinical setting,  
Occasionally, patients undergoing  elective surgery will be recruited from inpatient hospital units. These patients 
will be identified by routine screen ing of  the OR schedule then following the same process as described above, 
utilizing the EMR to further assess inclusion/exclusion criteria prior to approaching for informed consent and 
study participation .  
2.2.4 Informed Consent Process 
After determining clinical eligibility, the study will be discussed with patients, including all research related  
procedures, subject involvement,  risks and benefits. Patients  will be provided the opportunity to ask questions and 
if agreeable and demonstrate verbal understanding, we will obtain written informed consent prior to any study 
related procedures.  Subjects will be provided with a signed and dated copy of the consent form document.   
After obtaining informed consent, patients will be enrolled  in the trial. Final decision for randomization will be 
made in the operating room when patient meets criteria for study drug administration.  
2.2.5 Randomization and Blinding  
Randomization will be performed respectively by UCM Investigational Drug Services (IDS) , and TAH drug 
services),  using a 1:1 computer -generated randomization sequence , which will be concealed from investigators 
and the research team through study completion.  Consent ed patients will be randomly assigned to receive 
metoprolol tartrate  or an identical appearing placebo in a 1:1 ratio using permutation blocks (n=4 per block).  
Study subjects, clinicians and research team will be blinded to the randomization assignment.  Similarly, the 
adjudicators, whom will determine severity and relatedness of potential adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse 
events, will be blinded and only receive the information necessary to make a decision regarding relatedness to 
study treatment.  
Page 9 of 21 
 Perioperative intravenous doses of study drug will be prepared respectively by each institutions drug services 
department,  using identical syringes for administration of 5mg metoprolol tartrate  in 5mL (1mg/mL) or 5mL 
placebo (normal saline). Post -operative oral doses will be dispensed in identical capsules; active capsules will 
contain an over -encapsulated metoprolol tartrate  25 mg tablet with lactose monohydrate backfill and placebo 
capsules will contain lactose monohydrate for equal weight and feel.  
It’s the responsibility of the respective research pharmacies to maintain documentation of medication procurement 
and preparation, as well as randomization, dispensing, and accountability logs. All medications and blinding 
supplies will be stored in a secure location within the research pharmacy and maintained under controlled 
environmental conditions.  
2.2.6 Screening log of patients excluded from trial 
The study team will maintain a log of all patients screened for this trial to include:  
• Eligible and consent ed 
• Eligible and non-consent ed (reason for refusal)  
• Ineligible due to exclusion criteria, indicating  the unmet exclusion criteria  
2.3 Risks and Benefits  
2.3.1 Risks  
Risks associated with metoprolol:  Metoprolol is one of the most commonly used β -blocker s. 
Likely:  Reduction in heart rate and blood pressure,  
Less likely:  Bronchospasm, clinically significant hypotension and bradycardia, dizziness nausea, diarrhea  
Rare:  Stroke, death, heart failure, cardiac arrhythmias, blurred vision, hepatitis, psoriasis flare up, 
itching, rash  
 
Risks associated with blood collection : The blood draw may cause bleeding, bruising, or pain. There is also a rare 
risk of infection from venipuncture. Risk from blood collection from a catheter is primarily infection. Maximum 
blood collection is up to approx 37mL collected for up to 72 hours  postop.  
 Risks involving ECG : and hemodynamic monitoring includes mild skin irritation from the electrodes.  
 
Risk of confidentiality breach  is also possible.   
The patient will not be penalized or accrue any additional risks if they are randomized to the "placebo" group. No 
standard of care will be affected  by this study. If deemed necessary, an un- blinding of the primary care team by 
investigational pharmacy may be activated to ensure the appropriate care can be given to the patient.  
2.3.2 Benefits  
Participation in this clinical trial may provide additional benefit  from continuous hemodynamic monitoring and 
daily post -operative ECGs which  help detect silent cardiac events that otherwise may go unnoticed. Subjects will 
also receive daily post -operative follow -up visits from a member of the study team for assess ment of any AEs and 
SAEs.   
This clinical trial has the potential to significantly reduce risk of adverse perioperative cardiac events for patients 
in the metoprolol group. The anticipated additional benefit of this research is t o provide  validation of an evidence-
based approach utilizing hs-cTn assays in clinical practice to improve preoperative cardiac risk stratification.

 2.4 Withdrawal 
2.4.1 Early Withdrawal of Subjects   
Early withdrawal may occur per PI discretion  if deemed in the best interest of the subject. Subjects may also 
withdraw from study participation at any time.  At the time of withdrawal, the metoprolol (or placebo) will be 
stopped.  Patients who desire withdrawal from the protocol will be asked if they may be contacted at 30 -days and 
12-months to complete follow up.  
2.4.2 How and When to Withdraw Subjects  Befor e Randomization 
Patients who do not meet criteria to receive study dr ug in the OR prior to extubation will be withdrawn  per 
protocol  and will not undergo any further interventional study related procedures or treatments.  
3.4.3  Follow -up for Withdrawn Subjects  
The research team may continue to monitor withdrawn subjects for adverse events and serious adverse events 
during hospitalization.  
2.5 Study Drug  
2.5.1 Description of Study Drug  
Metoprolol is a β1 -selective β-blocker. The estimated oral bioavailability of immediate -release metoprolol tartrate  
tartrate is about 50%.56 Median elimination half -life of oral immediate -release metoprolol tartrate  is between 3 -5 
hours in normal metabolizers. Peak plasma concentrations are reached after 2 -3 min. for IV and 1-2 hours for oral 
metoprolol tartrate.  
2.5.2 Treatment Regimen  
At approx.  15 minutes before planned extubation in the OR, the patient’s hemodynamic status will be assessed to 
determine if randomization  criteria are met to allow  study drug administration . These criteria are:  
1) heart rate >65/min  
2) systolic blood pressure > 110 mmHg (if subject > 79 yrs, SBP target is > 120)  
3) minimal active bleeding  
4) no active wheezing;  
 
Subjects who  meet randomization criteria will receive the study drug. Subjects that do not meet the randomization 
criteria will be withdrawn.  
Participants will be administered study drug using a  double -blind, randomization as described above. Subjects 
will be randomized to one of the following two groups:  
• In the Beta -Blocker arm , patients will receive  up to 3 doses of 5mg IV Metoprolol tartrate prior to 
extubation to achieve target heart rate of 65/min , for a total of  up to 15mg IV Metoprolol tartrate , 
followed by 25mg immediate -release oral 25mg Metoprolol tartrate in the post -operative unit and every 8 
hours thereafter for up to POD 3 (72 hours)  
• In the Placebo  arm, patients will receive up to 3 doses of 5mL IV normal saline  (placebo)  prior to 
extuba tion, for a total of up to 15mL IV  placebo  followed by an oral matching placebo capsule (lactulose) 
in the PACU and every 8 hours thereafter  for up to POD 3 (72 hours)  
At least 2 hours after the first intraoperative dose and while in the Post -operative unit, the patient may  receive an 
oral dose of study drug (placebo vs oral metoprolol tartrate  25mg) if HR >65 bpm and SBP >110 mmHg (if 
subject > 79 yrs, SBP target is > 120) and no active or minimal bleeding or no active wheezing . This regimen will 
Page 11 of 21 
 be repeated on the floor every 8 hours with oral study drug (placebo vs 25mg metoprolol tartrate ) through 
postoperative day 3. Patients  who cannot receive oral medications per clinical orders, may  receive IV study drug 
(metoprolol tartrate  5mg or placebo 5mL ) to be administered over 2 minutes. If IV study drug is administered on 
the floor, additional monitoring via hospital telemetry should be active . Of note, the first oral dose administered 
on the floor should be given at least 4 hours following the Post -operative unit dose.  
Rescue Medication  
If patients develop clinically significant hypotension (defined as systolic blood pressure < 90 mmHg) , clinicians  
are encouraged to raise and  maintain a systolic blood pressure > 110 mmHg.  We will provide clinicians with an 
optional rescue protocol that includes administration of IV drugs (e.g. phenylephrine, ephedrine, etc.) and/or IV 
fluid bolus.  Likewise, i f patients develop clinically significant bradycardia (defined as HR < 50/min), clinicians 
are encouraged to raise the heart rate >60/min. Options may include IV glycopyrrolate , ephedrine, and atropine.  
2.5.3 Justification for Metoprolol Intervention  
The rationale for the metoprolol regimen is the following:  
1. IV metoprolol is the only AHA -recommended standard of care parenteral β-blocker for acute MI in non-
surgical settings  
2. The IV dosing regimen is identical to the MIAMI trial and COMMIT trial 
3. Data for bisoprolol are sparse and an IV formulation is not FDA -approved  
4. Atenolol has lower effectiveness compared to metoprolol and is no longer considered a first -line β -
blocker; furthermore, atenolol depends on renal excretion which may be affected by perioperative acute 
kidney injury  
5. Esmolol (ultra -short acting IV β -blocker) must be administered via IV infusion which excludes discharge 
of postoperative patients to a regular floor; thus, using esmolol would severely limit the eligible patient 
population to patients being admitted to an ICU or other monitored environment  
6. All perioperative MI studies have shown that >90% of perioperative adverse cardiac events occur between the day of surgery and postoperative day 3; therefore,  we decided on a short -term β -blocker 
intervention (3 days) that will cover this high-risk period compared to a 30-day course  
7. The daily oral metoprolol dose in this trial is 25% lower than in the POISE trial (150 mg vs. 200 mg) 
which we expect to retain the effectiveness of β-blockade while lowering the risk of hypotension and 
stroke .

2.6 Study Outcomes  
2.6.1 Primary Outcome Measures  
Primary efficacy endpoint:  Myocardial injury (hs -cTn elevation)  
Page 12 of 21 
 Primary safety endpoints:  Clinically relevant hypotension  
2.6.2 Secondary Outcome Measures  
1) MACE (Major Adverse Cardiac Events), including myocardial infarction , cardiac arrest , death  
2) Myocardial ischemia (ST -depression/elevation duration)  
3) Stroke  
4) Cumulative vasopressor requirements in post -operative unit  
5) Incidence rate and cumulative bradycardia duration (HR <50/min)  
6) Unplanned ICU admission  
7) Length of hospital stay 
8) Length of ICU stay  
 
2.6.3 Endpoint Definitions  
 
Myocardial Injury:  for statistical purposes, we will use the Δhs -cTn = difference between baseline and peak 
postoperative hs -cTn  as continuous variable . To define an “event”, myocardial injury will be defined as a new 
hscTn elevation >99th percentile,  or a 50% increase if the baseline hscTn is already elevated >99th percentile.  
 
Clinically relevant hypotension  is defined as cumulative hypotensive time (duration of syst. BP <90 mmHg) ; 
Symptomatic hypotension as event  is defined when there was a clinical intervention due to hypotension and/or the 
patient developed clinical symptoms due to hypotension.  
 
MACE  are defined as MI, cardiac death or coronary revascularization  
 
Myocardial Ischemia is defined as ST depression or elevation of ≥0.2 mV in one lead or ≥0.1 mV in two 
contiguous leads lasting ≥10 min  
 
Myocardial infarction  will be assessed according to the Third Universal Definition of myocardial infarction 
(rising pattern of cTn with at least one elevation > 99th percentile plus new ECG changes indicative of 
myocardial ischemia and/or clinical symptoms). New Q-waves, ST -segment depression or T -wave inversion ≥ 
0.1mV, or ST -elevation ≥ 0.2 mV in at least two contiguous leads are considered indicative of myocardial 
ischemia. The diagnosis of MI will be made and adjudicated by an attending cardiologist.  
 
Deaths will be reviewed by two independent physicians and classified as either cardiac or non -cardiac  
 
Sudden unexplained deaths  will be classified as cardiac unless evidence to the contrary (e.g. autopsy)  
 
Stroke  will be defined as focal or global cerebral, spinal, or retinal dysfunction of sudden onset that either : 1) 
persists for > 24 hours and has no known corresponding hemorrhage on brain imaging, or 2) persists for < 24 hrs and is associated with infarction of central nervous system tissue documented on brain imaging.

5.1.3 Adequacy of protection against risks  
• All subjects that participate will provide verbal understanding of risks and sign informed consent prior to 
enrollment in the study. Subjects will be informed that participation is voluntary , and they m ay refuse to 
participate and withdraw from the study at any time without penalty. Subjects will be told that in the event of a physical injury as the direct result of study procedures, the team will do everything to limit the 
injury at no cost to the patient , within the limits of the respective study sites.   
• All patients will receive general anesthesia by a team led by Board -certified/eligible anesthesiology 
faculty that operates at the highest standards of current medical practice and has an extensive experience 
in perioperative care for major vascular and other non-cardiac surgery. Patients will be fully monitored 
according to and exceeding of the American Society of Anesthesiology standards to quickly assess any 
adverse event or complication from the time in the preoperative holding area through operating room a nd 
post-anesthesia care unit.  
• Blood draws will be completed by clinical staff with  extensive experience in phlebotomy and blood 
collections.  
• Patient’s participation will be continuously assessed with ongoing study treatment at the discretion of the 
PI and the clinical care team.  
• Hemodynamic parameters designed to ensur e subjects receive study drug as appropriate and when 
indica ted (HR >65bpm and SBP >110 mmHg. If a patient is over 79 year of age, the S BP target will be 
120 mmHg. )  
• The clinical care team will be provided with the guidelines for providing rescue medicat ions if a patient 
develops clinically significant hypotension (defined as SBP <90 mmHg) or bradycardia (HR <50 bpm).  
• Serious adverse events will be reported to the respective institutional IRB/Ethics committee  according to 
current IRB/Ethics committee  guidelines. Adequate clinical care readily available at the Univ ersity of 
Chicago Medicine , and The Alfred Health,  major tertiary care hospital s with around-the -clock anesthesia 
attending staffing and ICU availability. 
• The attending surgeon and the surgery staff caring for the subject will be informed of  the subject’s 
participation and provided detail ed information related to study drug administration  
• The research team will be in open and continuous discussion with clinical team to ensure that there is no 
disruption in routine  medical supervision, comfort, and recovery 
• Extensive measures will be taken to prevent any confidentiality breach of participants’ information as described below  
5.1.4  Inclusion of Women  
There is no exclusion of any sex/gender or racial/ethnic group for these studies. This study  actively encourages  the 
participation of women.  The study goal is equivalent numbers of women and men.  
5.1.5  Inclusion of Minorities  
This study  actively encourages  the pa rticipation of minorities . Minority recruiting will typically match  the 
demographic composition of the University of Chicago community from which subjects will be recruited.  
5.1.6  Inclusion of Children  
Subjects <18 yr s will not be studied in these investigations.

by UC IRB.  
 
5.2 Data Management Practices  
All research data will be recorded and saved to a secure password protected research designated server at the resptive 
study sites.  Data will be de- identified and stored under lock and key (secured building, locked office, locked cabinet) 
and only the research team will access.   
5.3 Ethical Measures Pertaining to Clinical Care  
The research team will inform the  clinical team  of any relevant information that is ascertained as a result of the 
research monitoring (Holter, 12 lead ECG, VisiMobile hemodynamic monitoring, patient self -reported symptoms, 
etc).  
5.4 Linkages to Subjects and Access to Identifiers  
Any information that is obtained in connection with research that can be identified with a subject will remain 
confidential. Medical information, case report forms, pharmacokinetic and genetic data will be given a code and 
only the research personnel will have access to this information. The original informed consent forms will be kept 
by the PI for 7 years and a copy will be given to all subjects.  
6 ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING  
6.1 Definitions of Adverse Events  
An Adverse Event  is an unfavorable change in health that occurs in a patient during their enrollment in the 
clinical trial, even if it is not associated with the investigational study drug.  
An Unanticipated Problem  is an incident, experience, or outcome that meets all of the following criteria:  
1. Is unexpected in nature, severity, or frequency  
2. Is related or possibly related to participation in the research  
3. Suggests that the research places subjects or other  
A Serious Adverse Event  is an unfavorable change in health that:  
• Results in death  
• Is life -threatening  
o In the definition of serious adverse -events, the term “life-threatening” refers to an event during which 
the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not include an event which 
hypothetically may have caused death, had it been more severe.  
• Requires hospitalization or prolongation of the existing hospitalization, unless 
o The hospitalization was pre-planned before the study  
o Emergency room visits without hospital admission 
o Hospitalization for elective surgery for a condition that was pre- existing at the time of initial 
enrollment. 
• Results in a persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
o This refers to an event which causes a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal 
life functions. This does not include events of relatively minor significance such as uncomplicated 
nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, or accidental trauma (e .g. sprained ankle) which may interfere or 
prevent daily life functions but is temporary or does not constitute a substantial disruption.  
Page 18 of 21 
 • Resulting in a congenital anomaly or birth defect  
6.2 Classification of Adverse Events  
Adverse events assessment will be performed  by the PI to assign a rating for  severity and causality, per 
institutional and federal guidelines.  The PI  will consider alternative causes for the event, including underlying 
medical conditions, concurrent medical therapy, risk factors, prior reactions of similar nature within this class of 
drugs, and the temporal relationship of the event in context of the st udy drug pharmacokinetics .  
Relationship to study drug will be classified as:  
• None – An event for which there is no causal relationship between the study drug and the event and an 
alternative explanation is more likely. 
• Unlikely  – An event for which the relationship between the event and the study drug is not clearly 
established or uncertain . 
• Probable – An event for which there is most likely a causal relationship between the study drug and the 
event and an alternative explanation is less likely.  
 
Severity  for adverse events will be based on the PIs  clinical judgment. Severity  will be classified as:  
• Mild – An event that causes minimal discomfort to the subject and does not interfere with the functions of 
daily living.  
• Moderate – An event that interferes with, but does not prevent the subject from performing the functions 
of daily living.  
• Severe – An event that is incapacitating and prevents the subject from performing functions of daily 
living.  
6.3  Adverse Events Data Collection Procedures  
The investigators will closely monitor subjects for evidence of adverse events.  All adverse events will be 
reported and followed until satisfactory resolution.  The description of the adverse experience will include the 
time of onset, duration, severity, etiology, relationship to the study drug (none, unlikely, probable) and any 
treatment required. The clinicians will manage any postoperative event related to the patient’s surgical procedure as standard of care.  
6.4      Procedures for Serious Adverse Events  
All Serious Adverse Events or Unanticipated Problems will be reported to the IRB /Ethics committee  and 
respective study site DSMB in accordance with institutional and federal guidelines. Unblinding will be at the 
discretion of the PI with the collaborative effort s of the primary care team to determine the necessity. Study drug 
storage, logging, and distribution is the responsibility of the respective institutional drug service departments , and 
they will be responsible for notifying the care team of the patient’s randomized study arm.  
 
6.5 Summary of Adverse Event Classification and Reporting  
• All serious adverse events will be reported to the IRB within 7 calendar days  of initial receipt of the 
information  
• All unanticipated problems  will be reported to the IRB within 10 calendar days  of initial receipt of the 
information  
Page 19 of 21 
 SAEs will also be assessed for causality and severity per the Division of Clinical & Translational Research  
Standard Operating Procedures.  
7 STATISTICAL PLAN  
7.1 Sample Size Determination and Power  
This trial will randomize 600 study subjects to achieve a minimum of 500 evaluable subjects, which would 
provide a power (1 -β) of 0.99. For the primary efficacy analysis, we have based our estimate of the needed sample 
size based on our experience in the VINO trial conducted by Nagele et al.  at WU School of Medicine . We 
observed a standard deviation of 4.0 ng/L for the peak change in cTn from baseline. Using a two-sided α=.025, a 
difference between the two groups of 1.5 ng/L, and a conservative estimate of 250 usable peak values in each 
group we calculated a power (1 -β) of 0.99.  
7.2 Interim Analysis  
A blinded interim analysis for safety after 50% of patients have been enrolled, will be conducted. The interim 
analysis will not assess futility or early stopping other than for safety concerns. The DSMB will review the safety 
record and formally assess a statistically significant trend in increased rates of strokes and deaths at an alpha-level 
of 0.025. It is at the discretion of the DSMB to stop the trial for other safety concerns, such as in -creased 
hypotension.  
7.3 Statistical Methods and Analysis Plan 
a) Hypothesis  1 (In patients with high cardiovascular risk undergoing major, non- cardiac surgery, 
postoperative therapy with the beta-blocker metoprolol will significantly reduce postoperative myocardial injury without causing clinically significant hypotension ): The primary analysis will be intention -to-treat. 
The main comparison between metoprolol and placebo arm for the primary efficacy endpoints will be comparing the Δhs -cTn between both arms (Δhs-cTn  = difference between baseline and peak postoperative 
hs-cTn ). These will be tested with a simple t -test (α= 0.0 5). For the analysis of the primary safety endpoint 
(hypotension) the difference in cumulative hypotensive time will be tested with a t -test. Transformations will 
be used if there are substantial departures from the distributional assumptions for these t -tests. For secondary 
analyses of the hs-cTn values, we will fit a repeated measures analysis of variance model showing the time course of the average elevation and allow a test of the area under the cu rve with the use of an appropriate 
contrast statement. Secondary endpoints will be analyzed like the safety endpoint. We will also augment all analyses by repeating all analyses with an appropriate vector of covariates to an ANOVA model for 
continuous outc omes and for logistic regression for dichotomous variables.  
b) Hypothesis 2 (Postoperative β-blocker therapy is more effective in patients with elevated preoperative hs-
cTn (“high -risk” - patients ). To determine if postoperative β -blocker therapy is more effective in patients 
with elevated preoperative hs-cTn, we plan the following analyses: The first goal will be to identify a cutoff 
preoperative  hs-cTn concentration that defines high-risk patients using ROC analyses. Using this hs-cTn 
cutoff, we will compute the interaction of being in the high risk group and randomization group on the Δhs-
cTn (difference between baseline and peak postoperative hs-cTn) We will consider a two -sided p -value < 
0.05 for the interaction term (high-risk group * metoprolol) as statistically significant. Exploratory analyses will extend this model adjusting for known c ovariates of perioperative cardiac risk such as age, sex, eGFR, 
heart failure, etc.

 8 DATA AND SAFETY MONITORING  
8.1  Data Sources and Quality Assurance  
8.1.1 Sources of Material  
The following “materials” will be obtained from all study patients for research purposes only:  
• Blood tests for hs-cTn: approximately 5 mL at up to  6 time points over a 3 -day period and an additional 
7mL for DNA, for a total of up to approximately 37 ml blood  
• 12-lead ECG and digital recording of continuous Holter E CG (up to 72 hours postop)  
• Monitoring of vital signs: VisiMobile provides  continuous hemodynamic  monitoring (for 72 hours 
postop)  
• Daily post -op assessments for AEs/SAEs 
• Information from the patient’s medical record including progress notes, lab results and diagnostic testing 
 
Results from some of these tests will not available until several weeks after the patient has completed the study 
and will not enter the patient’s clinical record. Blood samples will be stored in a -80⁰  F freezer in a secure 
location, allowing only research team access. All samples will be de-identified with a study ID. All data will be 
for research purposes only. In the  event of an incidental finding, the PI will discuss such findings with the clinical 
team and/or primary care physician.  
8.1.2 Data Quality Assurance  
In order to optimize the accuracy and quality of data, we will:  
• Educate all members of the study team to study protocol, manual of procedures and work in accordance 
with good clinical practice  
• Provide manual of procedures and guidelines for data acquisition and the completion of the CRF  to ensure 
consistency  
• Utilize a  system of validation measures for the  CRF  to help protect against user error  
8.2 Confidentiality and Security  
All electronic data (except for an electronic key linking study ID to PHI) will be de -identified of protected health 
information that could link the data or blood samples to an individual subject . We will only use pre -assigned 
patient study ID number s to label  blood samples, Holter ECG, and hemodynamic information. The numbers are 
linked to subject  data and identifiers  using an electronic key . Only the research team will have access to the 
electronic key , which will be kept password -protected on a secured netwo rk. All research files will be stored in a 
locked and secure location only accessible to the study team. Electronically stored info will be encrypted and 
stored in a password protected database.  
8.3 Minimization of Bias  
Potential biases will be minimized by the study design of this double -blinded randomized controlled trial. 
Randomization will be performed by respective study site drug services department,  utilizing a 1:1 randomization 
sequence, which will be concealed from investigators until the completion of the study. Health care providers, 
study personnel and patients will be blinded to the assigned intervention group (placebo vs. metoprolol). 
Similarly, the adjudicators will also be blinded and only receive informati on necessary to make a  decision. Patient 
recruitment from  preoperative clinics reduce selection bias since this is a clearly defined and easily accessible 
population that is well-representative of patient undergoing non-cardiac surgery with high cardiac risk. All 
patients attending  the preoperative clinics will be screened according to routine operating procedures, with 
IRB/Ethics committee  approval for a partial waiver of consent, i rrespective of race, sex  and religion. A 
Page 21 of 21 
 standardized method of assessing reasons for dropouts and withdrawals will be utilized at multiple time-points 
throughout the study. This will be an intention to treat analysis to avoid bias during data analysis.  
8.4 Data and Safety Monitoring Board  
A data and safety monitoring board (DSMB)  will be established for this study  at each site consisting of two 
senior anesthesiologists who are not directly involved in the study, one biostatistician, and one cardiologist. The 
DSMB is responsible for overseeing the overall safety of the study and will meet before the start of the trial to 
discuss the study protocol and DSMB charter. The board will meet annually to review all adverse and serious 
adverse events. Should there be a serious adverse event that poten tially increases the risks to the participants, the 
study will be stopped, an investigation will be conducted, and a findings report will be generated before the study 
is resumed. These individuals will review; make decisions on adverse event data, other safety data, quality and 
completeness of study data, and enrollment data at each meeting to ensure proper trial conduct. The DSMB will 
review the consent periodically and/or as need ed consider whether the consent form requires  revision . At 
intervals, as not ed above, the DSMB will also review formal interim analyses.  In addition to regular meetings, it 
may be necessary to convene the DSMB urgently on an ad hoc basis to discuss new data or other information that 
raises questions about equipoise, safety, or conduct of the trial.  
It is expected that all DSMB members will attend every meeting and conference call. However, it is recognized 
that this may not always be possible. A quorum for voting is half of the standing members plus one. The board 
may wish to decide if particular exp ertise is needed with the quorum for a particular meeting. All standing 
monitoring board members are voting members. The board may decide in advance whether ad hoc members can vote and whether absent members can vote electronically on proposed issues in ad vance.

3.1 Systemic Lupus E rythematosus,  Immune Complexes , Human Safety Data with 
RSLV-132 
Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) is a heterogeneous autoimmune disorder affecting many 
tissues and organs including skin, kidney and brain [22] .   Despite wide in ter-patient diversity 
with respect to clinical manifestations, a common characteristic of SLE patients is the presence of circulating autoantibodies directed against nuclear antigens [24, 19] .  The presence of these 
autoantibodies signifies that host immune tolerance has been compromised.  The physiological 
cause underlying the loss of tolerance is unclear, but current theories include that SLE patients’ 
cells are predisposed to undergo capricious apoptosis or that host mechanisms involved in clearance of apoptotic cells/debris are impaired [27, 16].  In either scenario, the extracellular 
accumulation of nuclear -associated antigens, including nucleic acid -containing complexes, elicits 
B-cells to produce antibodies that recognize these normally sequestered components as foreign antigens.  As a result, immune tolerance is broken 
When complexed with their respective antigens, SLE patient autoantibodies form immune 
complexes (ICs) which can promote activation of immune cells in vitro.  For example, ICs formed following incubation of SLE patient sera with necrotic and/or apoptotic cell extracts (a 
source of nuclea r antigens), are effective agonists for activating plasmacytoid dendritic cells 
(pDCs) to produce type 1 interferon (IFN) [5] .  Circulating ICs recovered from SLE patients are 
also capable of eliciting IFN -α output from pDCs in culture, though lower abundance of the 
endogenous complexes relative to the quantities formed following addition of exogenous 
antigens promotes smaller quantities of cytokine production [1, 8] .  ICs also are capable of 
stimulating B -cells resulting in NF -κB activ ation and proliferation [15, 6] .  Moreover, SLE 
patient ICs have been reported to activate human polymorphonuclear (PMN) cell activities 
including chemotaxis, the oxidative burst response, and netosis [17, 7] .   In addition to effects on 
immune cells, ICs can deposit within tissues (e.g. kidney, blood vessels) where their physical 
accumulation and associated inflammation appear to disrupt normal homeostatic function [21, 3] .  
Overall, ICs are positioned at the ape x of an effector cascade which instigates and drives SLE 
disease pathology.   
Many common SLE patient autoantibodies are directed against nucleic acids or to proteins that 
bind to non-coding RNAs.  Importantly, recent studies have established that nucleic acids associated with SLE patient ICs are capable of activating Toll -like receptors (TLRs) [12, 18, 14, 
4, 13].   Although TLRs are thought to operate as key elements of the innate immune system by 
recognizing pathogen- associated molecular components, it is now clear that host nucleic acids 
also can activat e specific family members including TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9 [26] .   Cells 
expressing these receptors do so without distributing them to the cell surface; rather, TLRs 7/8/9 are sequestered within endosomes [26].  This positioning is postulated to minimize interaction 
with host nucleic acids.  However, when present within an IC, nucleic acid antigens are actively 
internalized into cells via receptor -mediated endocytosis.  Effector Fc, complement, and B- cell 
receptors all may facilitate entry of nucleic acid containing ICs into endosomes [18, 14] .  Once 
internalized, the nucleic acid cargo is positioned to bind to and activate resident endosomal TLRs.   Activated TLRs, in turn, promote type 1 IFN from pDCs, activate PMNs, and promote B-

Confidential  Version 5 27 April  2017  Page 15 of 52 cell proliferation and autoantibody production.  Thus, the nucleic acid- containing antigens are 
envisioned to contribute to multiple aspects of SLE disease pathophysiology.  
Evidence of the importance of TLR -induced signaling to autoimmunity is further suggested by a 
mouse transgenic line engineered to overexpresses TLR7 [9] .  Overexpression of this receptor is 
associated with development of spontaneous autoimmunity.  A substantial increase in TLR7 
expression is associated with enhanced mortality, an increase in circulating anti -DNA antibodies, 
and dendritic cell dysre gulation [9 ].  Given that the transgenic mice do not require an exogenous 
agonist to promote the autoimmune phenotype, these findings suggest that elevation of the receptor’s steady state expression is sufficient to tilt the homeostatic balance from a state where immune tolerance is maintained to one where tolerance is broken.  Since TLR7 is known to 
recognize RNA -containing ligands [11],  the spontaneous development of autoimmunity in the 
TLR7 transgenic animals suggests that endogenous RNAs are contributing to the 
pathophysiological response.   Importantly, when the TLR7 rece ptor transgenic mice are crossed 
with a mouse line over expressing bovine RNase under control of a serum albumin promoter, the double transgenic descendants demonstrate increased survival, reduced activation of T and B lymphocytes, and reduced hepatic infl ammation [25].  Thus, the addition of a secreted 
ribonuclease to the system appears to attenuate the heightened state of autoimmunity, presumably by degradation of the endogenous TLR7 ligands. 
Evidence also exists in humans suggesting that TLRs and nucleases impact SLE.  A mutation 
within the promoter of the TLR7 gene is reported to enhance TLR7 expression and to be a risk 
factor for development of SLE [ 23].  In addition, polymorphisms within TLRs 7/8/9 have been 
linked to SLE patients [10] .  Likewise , mutations resulting in loss of DNase1 or DNase1L3 each 
have been reported as predisposing to the development of SLE [28, 2].  Moreover, genetic 
association studies have established a link between the 3’- 5’ exonuclease T rex1 and SLE [20].   
Therefore, in both mice and humans the balance between the levels of endogenous nucleic acid-
containing ligands and expression of the nucleic a cid-sensing TLRs appears key in regulating 
cellular immune responses and autoimmunity. 
3.2 RSLV-132 
RSLV -132 is a novel therapeutic being developed for the treatment of SLE.  This fully human 
biologic ( Figure 1) consists of RNase1 (also known as pancreatic RNase) fused to the N-
terminus of the Fc segment of IgG1.  The attachment of the Fc segment is intended to extend the 
circulatory half -life of the RNase and by so doing reduce the frequency of administration.  
RSLV -132 is intended to utilize the RNase to break down RNA containing immune complexes, 
thereby reducing the activation of TLRs, decreasing the production of type 1 IFN and decreasing 
the proliferation of B- cells and autoantibody production.

Confidential  Version 5 27 April  2017  Page 16 of 52 Figure 1: Schematic of RSLV -132 
 
3.3 Study Rationale 
Chronic systemic inflammation is the hallmark of SLE.  There is a preponderance of scientific 
and clinical evidence that supports the concept that RNA associated with autoantibodies specifically delivered to immune system cells triggers multiple inflammato ry pathways.  
Many investigative drugs either currently or previously tested in lupus are designed to inhibit key inflammatory cytokines such as Interferon- α, Interferon -γ, or B- cell targets such as CD -20, or 
CD22.  All of these targets lie downstream of the initial triggering event and may be only one of the pathways involved in SLE inflammation.   
RNA- containing immune complexes circulating in SLE patient blood are specifically delivered 
to Fc receptor -bearing cells and internalized resulting in the activ ation of TLRs and the 
activation of myriad downstream inflammatory pathways.  RSLV- 132 is an enzymatically active 
RNase with a long circulating half -life that is designed to digest the RNA contained in these 
immune complexes and thereby render the immune complexes biologically inert.  The 
therapeutic hypothesis is that over time depleting the blood of RNA immune complexes will decrease the activation of multiple pro -inflammatory cascades and thereby decrease the overall 
SLE inflammation.  
3.4 RSLV-132 Human Safe ty Data  
Two safety studies in humans have been conducted to date with RSLV- 132; a single ascending 
dose study in 32 healthy volunteers, and a multiple ascending dose study in 32 subjects with systemic lupus erythematosus.  
 

Resolve Therapeutics    Protocol 132- 03 
 
Confidential  Version 5 27 April  2017  Page 17 of 52 3.4.1 Study 132-01 – Single Ascending D ose Study Summary: 
This first -in-man study was a double-blind, placebo-controlled study conducted in healthy 
volunteers in a phase one unit to assess the safety and tolerability of a single, escalating IV dose 
of RSLV -132 (0.3 mg/kg – 10.0 mg/kg).  There we no SAEs, or drug discontinuations due to an 
AE.  The drug was well tolerated at all doses tested and an MTD was not reached.  The serum half-life of the drug was measured to be approximately 16 days.  None of the subjects in the 
study were positive for anti RSLV-132 antibodies.  
3.4.2 Study 132- 02 Multiple Ascending Dose Study Summary: Safety  
This was a multi- center, double -blind, placebo- controlled study with successive escalating 
cohorts to assess the safety and tolerability of repeated IV doses (0.3 mg/kg – 10.0 mg.kg) of 
RSLV -132 in SLE subjects with inactive or mild disease.  The MTD was not reached at the 
highest dose of RSLV-132 tested.  Repeated administration of RSLV- 132 doses was generally 
well tolerated by the subjects in this study. Across all dose cohorts, AEs were observed at the same overall incidence in RSLV 132 subjects as placebo subjects (6/8 subjects [75%] versus 
18/24 subjects [75%]). The incidence of AEs and the average number of events per subject did not increase with increasing dose level. The most frequently reported AEs in the RSLV 132 arm 
were headache, nausea, and upper respiratory tract infection, each of which occurred in 5 
subjects (20.8%). The majority of AEs in this study were Grade 1 in severity; 13 subjects (10 RSLV -132 and 3 placebo subjects) experienced Grade 2 AEs, and one subject in Cohort 1 of the 
RSLV -132 arm experienced a Grade 3 AE of acute cholecystitis (this event was also reported as 
the only SAE in the study). No Grade 4 or Grade 5 events occurred. Adverse events judged to be related to  blinded study drug were reported for 38% of placebo subjects and 29% of RSLV 132 
subjects. No dose related trends were observed for any adverse event. No deaths due to AEs occurred. All subjects had at least one out-of-range chemistry, hematology, or urinalysis value, but no values were considered clinically significant in RSLV-132 subjects. No dose-dependent 
trends were observed in the incidence of out-of-range values and no concerning patterns of 
laboratory abnormalities were detected. No notable differences between treatment groups and no trends over the course of the study were observed in vital signs or physical findings. No 
clinically significant ECG abnormalities were reported during the study. No confirmed positive 
anti-RSLV -132 antibodies were detected in any of the subjects in this 113- day study.

Confidential  Version 5 27 April  2017  Page 19 of 52 5 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
5.1 Overall Study Design and Plan 
This is a  multi-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of approximately fifty subjects 
with SLE.  Potential subjects will be screened to assess their eligibility to enter the study within 
twenty -eight days prior to study entry (i.e., prior to Baseline visit ). 
Subjects will be evaluated during screening for evidence of active, evaluable cutaneous manifestations of SLE which will be measured by the investigator using the CLASI score and 
documented using photography.  The photographs will be adjudicated by a de rmatologist with 
expertise in the use of the CLASI tool in SLE clinical trials in order to confirm the subject meets 
the CLASI entry criteria.  
Following Baseline evaluations on Day 1, subjects will receive their first intravenous infusion of RSLV -132.   Subjects will return to the research unit for additional visits as described in 
Appendix A.   
The subjects will be randomized 2:1 (active:placebo) to receive IV administrations of 10 mg/kg 
of study drug or placebo as follows on days: 
• 1, 8, 15, 29, 43, 57, 71, 85, 99, 113, 127, 141, and 155 
5.2 Number of Subjects and Centers  
Approximately 50 subjects will be enrolled at approximately 15- 20 clinical centers in the United 
States, Canada and Europe.  
5.3 Estimated Study Duration 
Each subject will be screened within twenty-eight days of admission to the study center 
(Baseline visit).  The duration of the study from Baseline visit to End of Study visit, excluding 
the screening period is approximately 30 weeks for each subject.

one year since last menstrual cycle and confirmed by ensuring blood FSH levels ≥ 22 
mIU/mL);  OR practicing highly effective contraception (e.g., oral, implantable, transdermal or injectable contraceptives, a non-hormonal intrauterine device [IUD] with spermicide; female condom with spermicide; contraceptive  sponge with spermicide; 
intravaginal system, diaphragm with spermicide; cervical cap with spermicide; a male sexual partner who agrees to use a male condom with spermicide; a sterile sexual partner) for at least 2 months prior to dosing and until 110 days following the End of Study.  
9. Male participants must agree to use a male condom with spermicide from the first dose until 90 days after the last dose. Male participants must agree not to donate sperm from the first dose until 90 days after the last dose. 
6.2 CLASI Score Entry Criteria – Adjudication 
Prior to being enrolled in the study, each patient’s cutaneous SLE disease activity measure and photographs of the cutaneous areas of disease involvement will be submitted to and reviewed by 
an adjudicator.  The adj udicator is a dermatologist with extensive experience in reviewing 
cutaneous clinical data from SLE subjects in a clinical trial setting.  The adjudicator will review 
the photographs of the cutaneous disease to confirm the subject meets the entry criteria and is eligible for the study.  
6.3 Subject Exclusion Criteria  
The following will exclude potential subjects from the study:  
1. severe, active CNS involvement at Screening;  
Resolve Therapeutics    Protocol 132- 03 
 
Confidential  Version 5 27 April  2017  Page 21 of 52 2. severe renal involvement (urine protein/creatinine ratio of >200 mg/mmol, or an 
estimated creatinine clearance of <30 mL/min) at Screening;  
3. use of cyclophosphamide within 3 months of Baseline; 
4. use of background medications within 1 month of Baseline in excess of:

13. female subjects currently breast feeding at Baseline;  
14. inability or unwillingness to comply with study restrictions, return for follow up 
appointments, or other considerations, in the opinion of the Investigator, which would make the candidate unsuitable for study participation. 
6.4 Subject Withdrawal Criteria  
Subjects will be informed that they are free to withdraw from the study at any time and for  any 
reason. The Investigator may remove a subject from investigational treatment if, in the 
Investigator's opinion, it is not in the best interest of the subject to continue. Notification of discontinuation of investigational treatment will be made immediately to the Sponsor. In case of premature discontinuation of investigational treatment, efforts will be made to perform all End of 
Treatment (EOT) assessments  and an End of Study (EOS) visit outlined in (Appendix A ). 
 
If a subject wishes to withdraw from the study, the site staff should confirm whether the subject is agreeable to continue the assessments without the investigational treatment or if they wish no 
further involvement in the study. In the latter case no further study- related evaluations will be 
performed and no additional data will be collected.   
The date and the reason for discontinuation of investigational treatment or withdrawal from the 
study will be recorded on the subject’s Case Report Form (CRF). Subjects that withdraw after 
receiving study drug will not be replaced. 
6.5 Women of Child-Bearing Potential 
As women of ages 18 to 70 years old are eligible to enroll in this study, all women will be 
considered to be of child-bearing potential unless:

Confidential  Version 5 27 April  2017  Page 22 of 52 • the subject has undergone a surgical sterilization procedure (e.g. bilateral oophorectomy, 
hysterectomy, or tubal ligation); 
• the subject is greater than 12 months past her last menstrual cycle and menopause is confirmed by ensuring blood FSH levels ≥ 22 mIU/mL 
Pregnancy tests will be performed at Screening, Baseline, and End of Study visits for women of childbearing potential.

Confidential  Version 5 27 April  2017  Page 23 of 52 7 TREATMENT OF SUBJECTS 
7.1 Description of Study Drug  
RSLV -132 is a novel therapeutic candidate.  This fully human biologic consists of RNase1 (also 
known as pancreatic RNase) fused to the N-terminus of the Fc portion of IgG1.   The attachment 
of the Fc domain is intended to extend the serum half- life of the RNase and reduce the frequency 
of administration.  RSLV -132 is provided in single- use vials  for dilution for intravenous 
infusion.  Two lots of drug have been used in the study; lot 1- FIN-1778 which was provided at 
9.5 mg/mL, and lot 1- FIN-2899 which was provided at 10.0 mg/m L. 
7.2 Treatment Compliance  
Study drug will be administered at the clinical site by trained study staff according to the Study 
Drug Reference Manual provided by the Sponsor. 
7.3 Concomitant Medications  
Subjects entering the study who had no changes to their SLE medications in the previous 30 days 
prior to the Baseline visit shall remain on the background medications at the same doses 
throughout the study.  With the exception of decreases in OCS, no changes in lupus medications shall be permitted during the study, including the addition of topical steroids or topical tacrolimus, except for the rescue of a lupus flare.  
7.4 Steroid Tapering  
One of the objectives of the study is to evaluate the potential steroid sparing effects of RSLV -
132.  Steroid doses should remain stable through Day 85.  Thereafter, Investigators shall decrease the use of oral corticosteroids beginning on Day 85 using the guidance below.  No further steroid d ecreases should occur from Day 141 through Day 169. 
• Subjects receiving >7.5 mg of prednisone or equivalent daily AND demonstrating a clinical improvement in the cutaneous manifestations of lupus as measured by a decrease 
in the CLASI activity by 50% compar ed with Baseline shall decrease oral corticosteroids 
as follows: 
o Decrease prednisone (or equivalent) by 2.5 mg/day  
o If the prednisone dose (or equivalent) remains greater than 7.5 mg/day AND 
cutaneous disease activity remains improved (CLASI activity score decreased by 50% compared with baseline) AND prednisone has been stable for 2 weeks, 
reduce prednisone by an additional 2.5 mg; repeat after 2 more weeks.   
o If prednisone reduced to 7.5 mg, see below,  
o If after a decrease in prednisone, the CLASI is no lo nger decreased (compared to 
baseline) by 50%, the investigator may increase the prednisone to the previous 
daily dose (not to exceed the baseline dose)  
• Subjects receiving ≤7.5 mg/of prednisone or equivalent daily AND demonstrating clinical improvement in the cutaneous manifestations of lupus as measured by a decrease 
Resolve Therapeutics    Protocol 132- 03 
 
Confidential  Version 5 27 April  2017  Page 24 of 52 in the CLASI activity score by 50% compared with baseline, the investigator may, at 
his/her discretion, decrease prednisone by no greater than 2.5 mg/day every other week. 
7.5 Treatment of Flares  
Investigators should treat lupus flares as they deem appropriate with the minimum amount of 
corticosteroid necessary and should return the subject to baseline steroid dose as quickly as 
medically reasonable.  Should a subject require more than steroids for a lupus flare, investigators should treat as necessary and notify the medical monitor. 
7.6 Randomization and Blinding  
This will be a double-blind, placebo-controlled study. As such, except for the specifically 
designated unblinded study site pharmacist, the investigator, sponsor, and remaining study site 
clinical staff will be blinded as to treatment.  Ongoing drug accountability will be monitored by 
an unblinded monitor. 
Except in a medical emergency, the investigator or designee and blinded study site clinical staff 
will remain blinded during the conduct of the study and until such time that all discrepancies in 
the clinical database are resolved (i.e., at the time of the database lock). The date/initials and reason for the investigator and/or clinical staff r emoving the study blind will be documented.

Confidential  Version 5 27 April  2017  Page 27 of 52 9 ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY  
Safety of the treatment will be compared between the two groups by assessing adverse events 
and laboratory results as well as any physical findings that have changed from baseline.  
All patients who have received any infusion with either RSLV-132 or placebo will be included in 
the overall analysis of safety. All data relating to safety will be listed and summarized by 
treatment group using descriptive statistics. The change from baseline for each of the vital signs parameters will also be computed and included in individual patient listings and descriptive summaries.  
Deaths that occur during the study and the proportion of subjects discontinuing the study due to adverse events will as  well be summarized by treatment group.  
All adverse events will be coded and tabulated by MedDRA System Organ Class (SOC) and preferred term (PT) and presented in descending frequency. Adverse events will also be tabulated by severity and relationship to the study medication. Serious adverse events will be summarized separately.  
9.1 Adverse Event Definition  
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject administered a 
pharmaceutical product that does not necessarily have a causal relation ship with this treatment. 
Adverse events may be reported by the subject, discovered by Investigator questioning, or 
detected through PE, a laboratory test requiring further attention, or other means. 
Adverse events can therefore be any unfavorable or unintended sign, symptom or disease 
temporally associated with the use of an investigational medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the investigational medicinal product. Adverse events include: 
• Any sign, medical diagnosis or symptom 
• Any new un desirable medical experience or unfavorable and unintended worsening of an 
existing condition that occurs during or after treatment, whether or not considered related 
to study drug 
• Abnormal laboratory results that have associated symptoms or findings, require specific 
treatment, or require a change in subject management.   
Whenever possible, the Investigator should group signs or symptoms that constitute a single 
diagnosis under a single event term. For example, cough, rhinitis and sneezing might be grouped 
together as “upper respiratory tract infection”. If possible, abnormal laboratory results that meet 
the definition of an AE (that warrant management, investigation or treatment) should be reported as a clinical diagnosis rather than the abnormal value itself (e.g., “anemia” rather than “decreased 
blood count”).  Adverse events will be graded according to the Rheumatology CTC (Woodworth 
et al., J. Rheumatology 2007; 34(6): 1401-1414). 
Resolve Therapeutics    Protocol 132- 03 
 
Confidential  Version 5 27 April  2017  Page 28 of 52 9.2 Serious Adverse Event Definitions  
An AE is classified as serious if it meets any of the following criteria:  
• Results in death  
• Is life -threatening  
o This definition implies that the subject, in the view of the Investigator, was at 
immediate risk of death at the time of the event. It does not include an event that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death. 
• Requires in -patient hospitalization or prolongs an existing hospitalization 
o Hospitalizations for surgeries planned before study entry, for social reasons, or for 
normal disease management procedures (including  treatment adjustment) are not 
to be considered SAEs according to this criterion. 
• Results in persistent or significant disability and/or incapacity  
• Results in an adverse outcome in a child or fetus of a patient exposed to the study 
treatment regimen before  conception of during pregnancy. 
• Otherwise considered medically important in the judgment of a health care professional. Medical and scientific judgment should determine whether an AE is classified as an SAE 
in many situations. Medically important conditio ns that may not result in death, not be 
life-threatening, nor require hospitalization, may be considered SAEs when they may 
jeopardize the subject or may require intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. Examples of such events are allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment 
in an emergency room, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in in- patient 
hospitalization.  
9.3 Adverse Event Reporting  
All AEs, both serious and non-serious, will be recorded on the AE CRF at each visit from the time the subject receives the first dose of study medication until the End of Study visit.   
9.4 Serious Adverse Event Reporting Requirements  
SAEs will be reported to Resolve on the SAE report form within 24 hours of awareness of the event by the investigator.   
In the event that the investigator does not become aware of the occurrence of a SAE 
immediately, the investigator is to report the even t within 24 hours of his/her first awareness of 
the SAE.  
Any SAE occurring any time after the reporting period must be promptly reported if a causal relationship to investigational product is suspected.   
The initial report should include as much relevant information as possible but at a minimum 
should include subject Number, date of event onset, event term/description of event, 
investigator’s assessment of relationship to study drug. 
Resolve Therapeutics    Protocol 132- 03 
 
Confidential  Version 5 27 April  2017  Page 29 of 52 For all SAEs, the investigator is obligated to pursue and provide information to Resolve or its 
designee in accordance with the timeframes for reporting specified above.  In addition, an 
investigator may be requested by Resolve to obtain specific additional follow-up information in an expedited fashion.  This information may be more detailed than that captured on the AE case 
report form.  In general, this will include a description of the AE in sufficient detail to allow for a 
complete medical assessment of the case and independent determination of possible causality.  Informati on on other possible causes of the event, such as concomitant medications and illnesses 
must be provided.  All new information including final outcome should be submitted as soon as possible. 
9.5 Non-Serious Adverse Event Reporting Requirements  
Non-serious AEs are to be reported on the AE CRFs, which are to be submitted as outlined in the 
study guidelines.  
9.6 Adverse Event Follow Up  
For adverse events with a causal relationship to the investigational product, follow-up by the 
investigator is required until the eve nt or its sequelae resolve, stabilize or are explained.  
9.7 Severity Assessment  
As required on the AE case r eport forms, the investigator will assess the severity of an event 
according to the Rheumatology CTC (Woodworth et al., J. Rheumatology 2007; 34(6): 1401-1414). 
9.8 Causality Assessment  
The investigator’s assessment of causality must be provided for all AEs (serious and non-
serious).  Causality is determined as not related, possibly related, or definitely related according to the following definitions: 
• Not r elated: The event can be readily attributed to other factors such as the subject’s 
clinical state, environmental factors, or other concomitant medications or therapies administered.  
• Possibly Related: Follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administrati on and is 
unlikely to be attributed to the subject's clinical state or environmental factors or other 
therapies administered.  
• Definitely related:  Clear -cut temporal association with study drug administration with 
improvement on cessation of study drug AND cannot be readily attributed to other 
factors such as the subject’s clinical state, environmental factors, or other concomitant medications or therapies administered.  
9.9 Abnormal Test Findings  
When laboratory results are outside the normal range, a decision regarding whether the result is of clinical significance or not shall be made by the Investigator and shall be based, in part, upon 
Resolve Therapeutics    Protocol 132- 03 
 
Confidential  Version 5 27 April  2017  Page 30 of 52 the nature and degree of the observed abnormality. Abnormal evaluations may be repeated, to 
rule out lab error.  
The criteria for determining whether an abnormal objective test finding should be reported as an AE are as follows:  
• Test result is associated with accompanying symptoms, and/or; 
• Test result requires additional diagnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention, and/or;  
• Test result is considered to be an AE by the investigator or Sponsor. 
An abnormal test result, in the absence of any of the above conditions, does not constitute an AE. 
Any abnormal test result that is determined to be an error does not require reporting as an AE. 
9.10 Hospitalization  
AEs reported from the clinical study associated with subject hospitalization or prolongation of 
subject hospitalization, are considered serious. 
Hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization in the absence of a prec ipitating, clinical AE is 
not an SAE.  Examples include: 
• Admission for treatment of a preexisting condition not associated with the development 
of a new AE or with a worsening of the preexisting condition (e.g., for work-up of 
persistent pre- treatment lab abnormality); 
• Social admission (e.g., subject has no place to sleep); 
• Administrative admission (e.g., for yearly physical exam); 
• Protocol-specified admission during a clinical study (e.g., for a procedure required by the 
study protocol); 
• Pre-planned or opt ional admission not associated with a precipitating clinical AE.

RSLV -132 drug levels in subject serum samples will be quantitated by two different assays; a 
validated ELISA assay that dire ctly measures RSLV -132 (ICON Laboratories), and a catalytic 
activity assay that measures the RNase enzyme activity of RSLV -132 (Resolve Therapeutics, 
LLC).  
10.2 Pharmacokinetic Analysis 
Pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters will be calculated for each subject, whenev er possible, based 
on the serum concentrations of RSLV-132. 
Resolve Therapeutics    Protocol 132- 03 
 
Confidential  Version 5 27 April  2017  Page 32 of 52 11 STATISTICS  
A statistical analysis plan will be prepared after completion of the final protocol and will be 
finalized before database lock. The statistical analysis plan will include more details o n the 
statistical analysis and presentation of the data.  The fundamentals of the analysis are listed below.  Data will be analyzed and reported by subject’s sex and gender.  
11.1 Subject Population for Efficacy/Activity Analysis 
The efficacy/activity analysis set will include all subjects randomized and that receive at least 
one dose of study drug. 11.2 Analysis of the Primary Objective  
The primary objective is a comparison of the mean improvement (from Baseline to Day 85; or 
Baseline to Day 169 in CLASI Activity sc ores of those in the efficacy analysis set receiving 
RSLV -132 and those receiving placebo. 
11.3 Analysis of the Secondary Objectives  
The following secondary objectives will be compared between the two treatment arms: 
• The immunogenicity of RSLV-132 as measured b y the presence of RSLV -132 antibodies 
• Improvements (from Baseline to Day 85 and Day 169) in the SLEDAI-2K, PGA, and BILAG -2004 scores  
• Improvement (from Baseline to Day 85 and Day 169) in the FACIT- Fatigue scale  
• Improvements (from Baseline to Day 85 and Day 169) in tender or swollen joint count 
• Reduction in oral steroids at Day 169 relative to Day 85 
• The proportion of subjects achieving a 50% improvement in CLASI activity score 
11.4 Exploratory Analysis 
Differences between the gene expression profiles, autoant ibody and complement profiles, and 
serum protein levels will be compared between the two treatment arms.  A comparison will be 
made of the mean improvement (from Baseline to Day 85; or Baseline to Day 169 in CLASI 
damage scores of those randomized to be tr eated with RSLV -132 and those randomized to 
receive placebo.  
11.5 Subject Population for Safety Analysis 
The safety of RSLV -132 will be compared between the two arms using the following safety 
parameters:  adverse events, previous and concomitant medications, previous and concomitant 
diseases and laboratory data. The safety population will include all patients who received any 
treatment with either RSLV -132 or placebo. Randomized patients that receive the incorrect 
therapy from that intended will be summarized in the group according to the therapy actually 
received. Patients who are not randomized but who receive treatment or placebo will also be 
included in the safety population and summarized according to the therapy actually received. In

1997 Update of the 1982 American College of Rheumatology revised criteria for classification of 
systemic lupus erythematosus  
1. Malar Rash  Fixed erythema, flat or raised, over the malar eminences, tending to spare 
the nasolabial folds  
2. Discoid rash  Erythematous raised patches with adherent keratotic scaling and follicular plugging; atrophic scarring may occur in older lesions  
3. Photosensitivity  Skin rash as a result of unusual reaction to sunlight, by patient history or physician observation 
4. Oral ulcers  Oral or nasopharyngeal ulceration, usually painless, observed by physic ian 
5. Nonerosive arthritis  Involving 2 or more peripheral joints, characterized by tenderness, swelling, or effusion 
6. Pleuritis or pericarditis  1. Pleuritis --convincing history of pleuritic pain or rubbing heard by a 
physician or evidence of pleural effusion  
 OR 
2. Pericarditis --documented by electrocardigram or rub or evidence of 
pericardial effusion  
7. Renal disorder  1. Persistent proteinuria > 0.5 grams per day or > than 3+ if quantitation not performed 
 OR 
2. Cellular casts --may be red cell, hemoglobin, granular, tubu lar, or 
mixed  
8. Neurologic disorder  3. Seizures --in the absence of offending drugs or known metabolic 
derangements; e.g., uremia, ketoacidosis, or electrolyte imbalance  
 OR 
4. Psychosis --in the absence of offending drugs or known metabolic 
derangements, e.g., uremia, ketoacidosis, or electrolyte imbalance  
9. Hematologic disorder  1. Hemolytic anemia --with reticulocytosis  
OR

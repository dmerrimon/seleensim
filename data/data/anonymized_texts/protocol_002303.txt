6.0% . 
2. BACKGROUND/INTRODUCTION 
As defined by the Tear Film and Ocular Surface Society (TFOS) International Workshop 
on meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD) involving more than 50 clinical and research 
experts, “Meibomian gland dysfunction is a chronic, diffuse abnormality of the 
meibomian glands, commonly characterized by terminal duct obstruction and/or qualitative/quantitative changes in the glandular secretion.  It may result in alteration of the tear film, symptoms of eye irritation, clinically apparent inflammation, and ocular 
surface disease .”
1 
The LipiFlow® Thermal Pulsation System is designed to apply localized heat and 
pressure therapy to the eyelids , in subjects with chronic cystic conditions of the eyelids, 
including MGD.  The LipiFlow provides controlled, localized heat and pressure 
application to the eyelids as a prescription device used in a 12- minute in- office 
procedure by a licensed physician or technician (by the order of a licensed physician) .  
The LipiFlow uses an efficient method of melting the meibomian gland obstructions by 
applying heat to the inner eyelid surface, in closest proximity to the meibomian glands.  Additionally, the LipiFlow improves upon the physician practice of manual eyelid 
expression by expressing the glands at a level of force far below that required to 
manually express the glands without heat.  The use of LipiFlow has been reported in 
several publications and presentations to date.  Prior clinical studies demonstrate safety, 
effectiveness and clinical utility of the LipiFlow system with Activator LFD-2000.

The purpose of this study is to confirm the clinical use of the Lipi Flow system with 
Activato r LFD -2100 to successfully complete a Lipi Flow treatment procedure in human 
subjects.  Additionally,  the investigator rating of the ease of use of the LipiF low system

7. STUDY PRODUCTS  
The LipiFlow® Thermal Pulsation System is a prescription device with an indication for 
use for the application of localized heat and pressure therapy in adult patients with 
chronic cystic conditions of the eyelids, including meibomian gland dysfunction, also 
known as evaporative dry eye or lipid deficiency dry eye.  The LipiFlow is used by a

eyelid surface and intermittent pressure to the outer eyelid to facilitate release of lipid 
from the cystic glands.   
The LipiFlow has been most -recently cleared under pre -market notification ( K192623)  to 
market the device in the U.S (Class II device).  The LipiFlow with the existing Activator 
Model LFD -2000 is in commercial distribution based upon a determination by the FDA 
that the device is substantially equivalent to a legally marketed device.  The new 
Activator Model LFD-2100 is a modification of LFD-2000.   The risk assessment 
supports that the use of the LipiFlow with LFD- 2100 in this study is non- significant risk 
because the system is designed to control the application of heat and pressure  within a 
safe range and time.  The use of the newly designed LFD -2100 does  not change the 
overall residual risk of the device or introduce new risks to the patient  and/or user  as 
compared to the Activator Model  LFD-2000. No new potential hazards and harms to the 
patient or  user were identified for the device modifications  relative to the existing risk 
assessment for the Activator Model LFD -2000. The risk assessment was conducted to 
confirm that the change from LFD -2000 to LFD -2100 does not trigger any new risks, as 
the design specifications of the activator between the iterations remained unchanged, 
and that the main clinical efficacy intended use of regulated heat and pressure delivery to the eyelid remained unchanged.

10. EXPERIMENTAL PLAN  
10.1 OVERVIEW  
The study will be conducted in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and in accordance with U.S. Code of Federal Regulations , ISO 14155  and all 
other applicable laws and regulations. The study will not begin until IRB approvals have 
been obtained.  
Study activities may be delegated to qualified study staff, but the Principle Investigator  is 
responsible for all study activities.  Delegatio n must be documented before study 
activities commence.   Individuals involved in the conduct of this study will have 
documented training applicable to their respective roles. 
All tests in this protocol are to be performed by the invest igators  or designee s who are 
representative of the end- user community for the LipiFlow  system (e.g., 
ophthalmologists , optometrists  and technicians ).  All tests will be performed in a clinic, 
an office or laboratory setting and may be observed by JJSV personnel.  Three  to five 
investigators  or designees will perform the Lipi Flow treatments per this protocol on 
approximately 25 – 50 subjects per investigator  or designee, resulting in treatments in  
minimum 50 eyes and up to 100 eyes  in total .  
Informed consent will be obtained for each subject prior to any study -specific activities .  
The s ubjects may refuse participation or exit the study at any time.  If new information

Version 3.0  / Aug/31/2020                                                      10                                                    PR/DRYE -105-ACTS  becomes available that may impact a subject’s willingness or ability to cont inue 
participation in the study, the informed consent form will be revised,  and each subject 
will be re -consented.  
After screening and enrolment, if a subject meets all inclusion / exclusion criteria, the 
investigator  or designee will perform a complete Li piFlow treatment with Activator LFD-
2100 on both eyes of a subject .   
The i nvestigator  or designee will complete a questionnaire regarding the clinical use of 
the Activator LFD-2100 ( see Appendix A ).  The treatment reports automatically 
generated by LipiFlow Console after completion of each treatment  will be printed out and  
collected.   The reports will present  confirmation of treatment completion together with 
treatment information such as the changes in pressure and temperature during the 
treatment . 
Typical duration of study  exams and treatment will last approximately 1-2 hour s.  All data 
will be de -identified or encoded to protect the privacy of the subject and confidentiality of 
the data.   Although the study is not masked, to maintain consistency, it is recommended 
that a single individual (study technician or coordinator designated by the investigator) conduct all study -related eye testing, although a back -up person should also be 
designated and trained.   
The investigators  will be provided with the LipiFlow Consoles  (if needed) , LipiFlow 
Activator LFD -2100, Semi -permanent Cable, Lid Stabilizer Tape, and the LipiFlow , 
Activator, and Cable Instructions for Use (IFU) , including the Quick Start Guide.   Prior to 
human use, Activ ator LFD -2100 will be described in sufficient detail s in a Clinical 
Investigator Brochure to adequately describe the theory of operation and compliance to applicable standards in humans.  
10.2 VISIT SCHEDULE 
Each subject will have a 1-2 study visit s which include informed consent, screening for 
study participation and performing the LipiFlow treatment with Activator LFD- 2100 (see 
Appendix C ).  Unscheduled visits may be conducted as necessary at the discretion of 
the investigator for clinically -indicated follow -up. 
Inclusion and exclusion qualifications will be assessed prior to study treatment .  The 
Informed Consent Document must be signed by any subjects who agree to participate in the study prior to undergoing any study -specific procedures.   
Study parameters and methods are listed as below:  
1) Informed consent  
JOHNSON & JOHNSON SURGICAL VISION  CONFIDENTIAL  
Version 3.0  / Aug/31/2020                                                      11                                                    PR/DRYE -105-ACTS  2) Screening and Enrollment: including but not limited to reviewing medical and 
ocular history , discussing study eligibility  etc.  
3) Perform a pre- treatment slit lamp evaluation, non- dilated fundus exam, ocular 
surface staining for all the subjects, and optional  meibomian gland assessment  at 
the investigator’s discretion.  
4) Complete a  bilateral LipiFlow treatment with Activator LFD -2100 on both eyes of 
a subject , and collect the treatment reports automatically generated by the 
LipiFlow console after completion of each treatment. 
5) Perform a post -treatment slit lamp evaluation and ocular surface staining.  
6) Questionnaire: The Investigator  or designee will complete a questionnaire 
regarding the clinical use of the Activator LFD-2100 (Appendix A ). 
10.3 PROCEDURES  
The procedures in the Pre-treatment v isit include Informed Consent, Screening & 
Enrollment,  and Pre- treatment slit lamp evaluation, non- dilated fundus exam, ocular 
surface staining, and optional meibomian gland assessment  (at the investigator’s 
discretion) .  The procedures in the Treatment Visit include LipiFlow Treatment , post-
treatment slit lamp evaluation, ocular surface staining, and completion of the 
Questionnaire.  These procedures must be done in the order shown as below.  
Informed Consent  
The Investigator or designee identifies potential study participants by reviewing medical 
records of subjects .  Potential study participants are scheduled for the study visit.  
At the visit, the Investigator or designee conducts the informed consent discussion and explains the study purpose, procedures, benefits, risks, discomforts, precautions and 
subject responsibilities to the potential study participant.   The Investigator may provide 
written delegation of authority to a trained and qualified study staff member (e.g ., study 
coordinator, technician) to conduct the consent discussion; however, the Investigator 
should be available to answer the potential participant’s questions, as needed.  
Once the Investigator or designee has answered all the potential participant’s questions 
to his/her  satisfaction and the potential study participant has voluntarily agreed to 
participate in the study, written informed consent is obtained using the IRB/IEC -
approved informed consent document.  The subject and the person conducting the consent discussion (Investigator or designee) print their names, sign and date the 
consent.  If the subject is unable to read, the consent document can be read to the subject in front of an impartial witness, who also prints his/her name, signs and dates the consent.  
JOHNSON & JOHNSON SURGICAL VISION  CONFIDENTIAL  
Version 3.0  / Aug/31/2020                                                      12                                                    PR/DRYE -105-ACTS  All subjects enrolled in the study must sign the current IRB/IEC -approved informed 
consent document.  The informed consent must  be signed before any study -specific 
examinations are performed, and this must be documented in the source documents .  
An authorization for use/disclosure of health information form (HIPAA authorization)  or 
similar medical measurement privacy law documentation must also be signed.   
The Investigator maintains the signed informed consent document and the signed 
authorization form as a permanent part of the subject’s medical records and provides a 
signed copy of the consent to the subject.  The Investigator or designee documents in 
the medical records that informed consent was obtained prior to any study -specific 
procedures and a copy of the signed consent was given to the subject.  
As the Informed Consent Form is signed prior to any study -specific procedures, some 
subjects may not qualify after study -specific testing is performed.  Subjects will be 
considered screen -failures i f they do not qualify or if they qualify but decide not to 
proceed with study treatment .  These subjects will be exited from the study.   
Screening & Enrollment  
Following the informed consent process, the Investigator or designee will perform the screening exam procedures and evaluate the subject conditions that affect study eligibility, as listed in Sections 8.  The screening exam may be ended prior to 
completion if the Investigator or designee determines that the subject does not meet one 
or more of the eligibility criteria.  The subject must meet all the study inclusion / 
exclusion criteria based on testing and medical history discussion conducted at the visit.  
The screening exam to be performed for each eye includes:  
MEDICAL AND OCULAR HISTORY  
To determine the presence of any systemic or ophthalmic factors that may affect the subject’s eligibility based on the study inclusion and exclusion criteria in Sections 8, the 
Investigator or designee obtain the subject’s medical and ophthalmic history at the visit, including assessment of:   
1) demographic information (age, gender, race/ethnicity);  
2) ophthalmic conditions and medications;  
3) history of ocular surgery, ocular injury, ocular infection, ocular inflammation, ocular allergy, eyelid abnormality, or ocular surface abnormality;  
4) pregnant and breastfeeding conditions, if applicable;  
5) recent participation in another ophthalmic clinical trial;  
6) employment or relationship with any employee at the clinical study site.  
BIOMICROSCOPIC SLIT -LAMP EXAM   
A biomicroscopic slit -lamp exam must be performed at the study visit to determine if the 
subject meets inclusion/exclusion criteria  (see Appendix D ).  The Investigator or 
designee evaluates the eyelids, palpebral and bulbar conjunctiva, cornea, anterior

everts the upper eyelid to evaluate the upper palpebral conjunctiva. The Investigator or designee assesses the findings for the presence of any medical findings . 
NON-DILATED FUNDUS EXAM     
A non-dilated fundus exam shall be performed at the study visit to determine the status 
of the ocular media, retina and lens  and to determine if the subject meets 
inclusion/exclusion criteria . 
Potential participants who are approached with the informed consent document will be 
documented on the Subject Accountability  Log.  A subject who does not meet the 
eligibility criteria or who chooses to discontinue study  participation  at any time  is 
documented on the Subject Accountability  Log as a Screen Failure or Exited Subject 
along with the reason. All subjects who sign the informed consent document  are 
assigned a subject identifier.  
MEIBOMIAN GLAND ASSESSMENT ( OPTIONAL ) 
The MGD diagnosis can be based on prior medical records, investigator opinion , or in 
conjunction with an assessment of meibomian glands of the lower eyelid ( see Appendix 
E).  The need for the meibomian gland assessment is at the investigator’s discretion.  
If the Investigator or designee decides to conduct the meibomian gland assessment  to 
evaluate the function of the meibomian glands, the Investigator or designee can assess 
the color and consistency of the secretion characteristics from the gland orifices along 
the lower eyelid in each eye.  The Investigator or designee evaluates the glands using a 
slit-lamp biomicroscope and a handheld instrument, Meibomian Gland Evaluator (MGE) 
(as s hown in Appendix E), to apply gentle pressure along the eyelid margin, which 
simulates a forceful blink in yielding secretions from the glands. This instrument provides a standardized method to apply the same amount of pressure at each visit and for each subject to ensure measurement consistency.  This Class I, 510(k) -exempt device is 
commercially available, and is being used in this study in accordance with the indications in the commercial product labeling.  
There are approximately 20 to 30 meibomian glands along the lower eyelid.  The Investigator or designee assesses and grades glands located temporally, centrally and 
nasally.  The central region of the Meibomian Gland Evaluator should be carefully placed 
in the temporal, central and nasal regions as described in Appendix E to avoid overlap 
in the gland assessment.  
OCULAR SURFACE STAINING  
Ocular surface staining of the cornea and conjunctiva shall be  evaluated.   The 
Investigator or designee assesses the corneal staining after instillation of fluorescein dy e

in the eye, as defined in Appendix F. 
LipiFlow Treatment  
If a subject meets all inclusion / exclusion criteria, the i nvestigator  or designee will 
perform a complete LipiFlow treatment with the Activator LFD-2100 on both eyes of a 
subject.  
If the Treatment Visit doesn’t happen on the same day of the Pre- reatment Visit, a 
biomicroscopic slit -lamp exam must be performed before LipiFlow treatment perfor med 
at the Treatment visit to assess the findings for the presence of any medical findings . 
The Investigator or designee cleans the lid margin and then performs treatment with the LipiFlow system per the LipiFlow Thermal Pulsation System Instructions for U se.  The 
Investigator or designee documents any problems with the LipiFlow system during 
treatment.  The Sponsor will investigate any reported problem with the LipiFlow system.  
TREATMENT  PROCEDURES  
1. Inspect expiration date on Activator LFD -2100 packaging and place Activators 
LFD-2100 in subject’s eyes . 
Inspect the expiration date on the Activator LFD-2100 packaging before using 
the Activator. Verify the date has not expired.  
1.1. Cable setup  
Prior to using Activator II (LFD -2000), the Cable (Model CBL-2000) must be 
attached to the Console and locked into place with the locking clip.  Plug the Cable connector into the Console and push the locking clip into the connector . 
1.2. Disinfect cable and connect Activator LFD -2100  
Disinfect the Cable plug to Activ ator LFD-2100 and tubing with isopropyl 
alcohol (70- 90% concentration) prior to connection to the Activator  LFD-2100. 
The investigator or designee will open the Activator  LFD-2100 package 
consisting of the combined lid warmer and eye cup.  Before removing the 
Activator LFD-2100 from its package, connect the Cable to the Activator while 
inside the package to minimize user handling prior to insertion.  Leave the 
Activator II inside the package until the Activator LFD -2100 self-test is 
completed. 
1.3. Run Activator LFD-2100 self-test:

system is running a Activator self-test is briefly displayed on the Console 
Treatment screen above the pressure sequence overview graph.  
1.4. Inspect and Placement of A ctivator LFD -2100 :  
The investigator or designee will inspect the Activator s LFD-2100 to ensure 
that there are no rough or sharp edges  and then place the Activator s LFD-2100 
in subject’s eyes.  
1.5. Stabilize the Activator  LFD-2100:  
 Position the patient in a reclined or supine position for treatment. Place 2 
drops of commercially available anesthetic in the eye(s) to be treated. Once the 
Activator is placed correctly, secure the Activator with medical -grade adhesive 
tape (either the Lid Stabilizer or surgical t ape). 
2. Run LipiFlow Treatment  with Activator LFD- 2100 
After securing the Activator LFD -2100, the investigator or designee will run  and 
complete the LipiFlow treatment with the Activators and monitor the Activator s 
position on the eyelids during treatment.  
3. Remove Activator LFD -2100 
3.1. Disconnect Activator LFD -2100 from subject’s eyes  
3.2. Disconnect Activato r LFD-2100 from the Cables 
After completion of each treatment, the treatment reports automatically generated by 
LipiFlow Console will be printed out and collected. The reports will show completion of 
the treatment and additionally the changes of pressure and temperature during the treatment . 
Following the completion of LipiFlow treatment, the Investigator or designee will perform  
a slit-lamp evaluation ( Appendix D ) and ocular surface staining ( Appendix F) in each 
eye to check for any adverse events.   
Questionnaire 
A questionnaire will be administered to the investigator or designee to collect information  
regarding the clinical use of Activator LFD-2100 (Appendix A ).

Version 3.0  / Aug/31/2020                                                      16                                                    PR/DRYE -105-ACTS  10.4 ACTIVATOR SUPPLY  
For all the study subjects, the Activator s will be obtained from the site study consignment 
supplied by JJSV prior to the first  study treatment .  On e Activator  will be used on each 
eye of a subject.  Unused back -up Activators are to be returned to the site consignment.  
At the completion of all study treatments , any remaining Activator s will be shipped back 
to JJSV following the final accountability by a JJSV St udy M onitor.  At all times, the 
storage, access and use of all the consignment Activators must be controlled.   
10.5 EXIT OF SUBJECTS 
An Exit Case Report Form will be completed for all subjects, either when they complete 
the study or if they exit early.    
It is the responsibility of the investigator to provide complete follow -up data to JJSV for 
each subject, and every attempt should be made to gather that complete follow -up data 
for all subjects enrolled as missing data can have a negative effect on the study results .  
A subject will be considered a “screen failure” if he/she does not meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria or if consent is withdrawn prior to LipiFlow treatment .   
If a subject is exited early from the study, the investigator or designee will complete an 
Exit Case Report Form indicating the reason for study exit.  In the event of any serious 
adverse event, the subject may be exited from the study; however, efforts must be made 
by the investigator to follow the subject until resolution of the adverse event.    
Following study completion or early exit, all study subjects are to be instructed to 
undergo regular eye examinations at least yearly and also to return to their doctor if any eye complications are experienced in the interim.  
10.6 UNSCHEDULED VISITS 
During the study period or immediately after (within 1- week) , if a non- protocol -required 
visit is done for the purpose of medically -indicated follow -up for a study eye, data from 
this visit should be reported using the Unscheduled Visit CRF.  The need for unscheduled visits is at the investigator’s discretion.  Specific examinations to be 
performed at unscheduled visits are also at the discretion of the investigator (based on 
the reason for the unscheduled visit) and data are to be recorded in the appropriate section of the case report form.  
10.7 PROTOCOL DEVIATIONS  
Any departure from the protocol procedures represents a protocol deviation.  Protocol 
deviations may be subject -based (e.g., inclusion/exclusion criteria, informed consent 
deviation,  etc.) or procedural -based (e.g., out -of-interval visits, non -compliance with

Capture (EDC) system .  Any deviation made to protect the life or physical wellbeing of a 
subject in an emergency as well as any use of the investigational device without 
obtaining informed consent must be reported to JJSV within 5 working days.   Protocol 
deviations will be monitored by JJSV, and if the non- compliance is persistent or 
egregious, JJSV may take action, including but not limited to termination of the 
investigator’s participation in the study.  The investigator is also responsible for informing 
the reviewing IRB of instances of protocol non- compliance in accordance wi th the IRB 
requirements.  
11. ADVERSE EVENTS AND PRODUCT COMPLAINTS  
11.1 DEFINITIONS  
Adverse Event (AE)  
An adverse event is defined (following ISO 14155) as any untoward medical occurrence, unintended disease or injury, or untoward clinical signs (including abnormal laboratory 
findings) in subjects, users or other persons, whether or not related to the study  device.   
Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
An adverse event is considered serious (following ISO 14155) if it is an untoward 
occurrence which may or may not be related to use of the study device that  
• is sight - or life -threatening,  
• results in death,  
• requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization (a planned 
hospitalization for a pre- existing condition without a serious deterioration in health is 
not considered a serious adverse event),  
• results in permanent impairment of a body structure or body function,  
• necessitates medical or surgical intervention to prevent permanent impairment to a body structure or function, or  
• results in fetal distress, fetal death or a congenital abnormality or birth defect  
Device-Related Adverse Event/Adverse Device Effect (ADE)  
A device -related adverse event is defined as any adverse even that is believed to be 
definitely, probably or possibly related to the study device.  A device- related event is also

Version 3.0  / Aug/31/2020                                                      19                                                    PR/DRYE -105-ACTS  events will be reported to the appropriate regulatory agencies according to all applicable 
laws and regulations.   
Reporting of adverse events shall follow the applicable Regulations.  General guidelines are provided below:  
Adverse Event Reporting  
An adverse event that is not serious or device- related is to be reported to JJSV in a 
timely manner.  Notification of non- serious and non- device related adverse events will 
occur by recording events on the CRF when noted.  Such adverse events are also to be reported to the reviewing IRB/IEC per their reporting requirements.  
Complaints/Device Deficiency Reporting  
A general product complaint or device deficiency is to be reported to JJSV in a timely 
manner.  Notification of complaints/device deficiencies will occur by either recording 
complaints on the CRF when the complaint occurred (e.g. operative form) or by a phone call to the Sponsor.  Any device deficiency that could have led to a serious adverse 
event without suitable action or intervention, or under less fortunate circumstances, must 
be reported to the sponsor immediately (no later than 24 hours after detection). Device 
deficiencies that could have led to a serious adverse event should also be reported to 
the investigator’s IRB/IEC per their reporting requirements.  
Serious and/or Device -Related Adverse Event Reporting  
Serious and/or device related events (ADEs) are to be documented using the Serious 
Adverse Event/Adverse Device Effect (SAE/ADE) CRF.  In the event of a serious 
adverse event (SAE), which may or may not be related to use of the study device, JJSV 
must be notified immediately (no later than 24 hours after detection).   Any SAE is to be 
reported by phone (and/or email) and by submitting the completed SAE/ADE CRF.  Any 
SAE o r device -related AE should also be reported to the investigator’s IRB/IEC per their 
reporting requirements.  
Unanticipated Adverse Device Effect (UADE)/Unanticipated Serious Adverse 
Device Effect (USADE) Reporting  
If during the study, a serious adverse event occurs that may reasonably be regarded as device- related and was not previously expected in nature, severity, or degree of 
incidence, the investigator is to report the UADE/USADE to JJSV within 24 hours , and to 
the investigator’s IRB/IEC as soon as possible (and no later than 10 working days after 
learning of the event for sites in the USA as required by 21CFR812).  
11.4 CAUSAL RELATIONSHIP  
The investigator should always be alert to adverse events that may be related to the study device or the use of the study device (i.e., the procedure specific to the initial application of the device).  An attempt should be made in every case to determine the 
causality of the event.  The following definitions are to be used as guidelines in determining the relationship between the event and the study device and/or use of the 
device.   
JOHNSON & JOHNSON SURGICAL VISION  CONFIDENTIAL  
Version 3.0  / Aug/31/2020                                                      20                                                    PR/DRYE -105-ACTS   
Definitely related:  If the event is associated with the device and/or the use of the 
device beyond a reasonable doubt, a causal relationship exists between the adverse event and the device and/or the use of the study device.  
Probably related:   There is a reasonable possibility of a causal relationship between the adverse event and the device and/or the use of the study device and/or the adverse event cannot be reasonably explained by another cause.  
Possibly related:   The adverse event has not been determined to be related to the device or the use of the device, but no other cause has been 
identified and the device and/or the use of the study device 
cannot be ruled out as a possible cause.  
Unlikely to be related:  The possibility of a potential causal relationship between 
adverse event and the device and/or the use of the device could 
exist, but the adverse event can be reasonably explained by 
another cause.  
Not related:  There is no possibility of a causal relationship between the adverse event and the device and/or the use of the study device and/or the adverse event can be attributed to another cause.  
If an adverse event is believed to be definitely, probably or possibly related to the study device and/or the use of the device, the event will be considered related to the study device and/or the use of the device.   
11.5 ADVERSE EVENT  FOLLOW -UP 
For every adverse event, appropriate measures should be undertaken to treat and/or 
monitor the subject until resolution occurs.  Obtain and maintain in the subject's files all 
pertinent medical data relating to the event including the subject’s medical records and medical reports and/or judgments from colleagues or outside specialists who assisted in the measurements of the subject. The investigator should keep JJSV closely informed as to the outcome of serious and/or device- related adverse events, thereby allowing 
JJSV to comply with the appropriate regulatory reporting requirements.  A SAE/ADE  
Follow- up CRF should be completed each time the subject returns to the investigator  for 
follow- up of serious and/or device- related adverse event until resolution of the event.  
Any subject who is exited from the study due to a serious and/or device- related adverse 
event or prior to resolution of such an event will be followed until the outcome is 
determined.  
12.0 PROTOCOL CHANGES/AMENDMENTS  
If the investigator desires to modify any procedure and/or the design of the study, he or 
she must contact and obtain consent from JJSV regarding the proposed changes prior to

of the gov erning IRB prior to implementation.   
13. ETHICS REVIEW AND SUBJECT  WELFARE  
13.1 INSTITUTIONAL REVIEW BOARD (IRB) 
It is the responsibility of the investigator to obtain prospective approval of the study 
protocol, protocol amendments or changes, informed consent forms and other relevant 
documents (e.g., advertisements) from the IRB.  All correspondence with the IRB should 
be retained in the Investigator Notebook.  Copies of IRB submissions and approvals 
should be forwarded to JJSV. 
The investigator is responsible for notifying the IRB of reportable adverse events as well 
as any other circumstance in which additional procedures outside the protocol were conducted to eliminate apparent hazards to subjects.  
13.2 INFORMED CONSENT  
The current version of the IRB-approved study informed consent must be signed by 
each study subject prior to any study -specific examinations being performed.  The 
IRB-approved informed consent is to be signed and dated by the subject as well as by 
the person who conducted the informed consent discussion.  The signed informed consent will be maintained by the investigator as a permanent part of the subject’s 
medical records.  A copy of the signed and dated form is to be provided to the subject.  
The investigator will provide JJSV written  acknowledgement on the case report form that 
a signed agreement of informed consent has been obtained and is in the investigator’s possession for each subject.  As required by 21CFR812 Part G, the site shall document 
in the source documents that informed consent was obtained prior to participation in the 
study for each subject enrolled . 
NOTE:  The informed consent process also includes obtaining the subject’s signature on 
an Authorization for Use/Disclosure of Health Information for Research Form or equiva lent documentation necessary to comply with applicable privacy laws pertaining to 
medical measurement in the governing countries.   
NOTE:  The sponsor will secure appropriate insurance for study subjects prior to study start.

14.1 SOURCE DOCUMENTS  
Source documents must be kept for all study subjects.  Source documents may include 
a subject’s medical records, hospital charts, clinic charts, the investigator’s subject study 
files, as well as results of any diagnostic tests or procedures such as topographies or laboratory tests with photographs or instrument printouts.  
Each site is expected to adhere to the clinic’s own standard documentation requirements 
for medical charts/clinic notes.  However, for the purposes of this clinical study , the 
medical charts/clinic notes must also include, at a minimum, the following data that will 
be considered source data and will be reviewed by JJSV: 
• Subject’s name and study identification number  
• Subject’s contact information 
• Study protocol number and the Sponsor name ( JJSV) 
• A statement that informed consent was obtained prior to participation in the study (including the date)  
• Dates of all subject visits throughout the duration of the study  
• Study measurements  
• Description of any adverse events and/or product complaints/device deficiencies  and 
documentation of appropriate reporting 
• The date the subject exited the study, and a notation as to whether the subject completed the study or reason for early exit.  
14.2 SUBJECT CONFIDENTIALITY  
Subjects will be assig ned a site/subject number to maintain subject confidentiality.  
Subject names may possibly be disclosed to the JJSV or regulatory agencies during 
inspection of medical records related to the study, but reasonable precautions will be taken to maintain confidentiality of personal information to the extent permitted by applicable laws and regulations.  
14.3 CASE REPORT FORM COMPLETION  
This study will use  the IBM Merge EDC system.  The investigator is responsible for 
ensuring that data are properly recorded on each subject’s case report form and related documents.  Prior to database lock, the investigator will verify completeness and accuracy of data submitted to JJSV.  
JOHNSON & JOHNSON SURGICAL VISION  CONFIDENTIAL  
Version 3.0  / Aug/31/2020                                                      23                                                    PR/DRYE -105-ACTS  14.4 STUDY SUMMARY  
A final investigator’s summary will be provided to JJSV and the reviewing IRB within 3 
months after termination or the completion of the study  or the investigator’s part of the 
investigation.  
15. MONITORING  
JJSV will perform three types of monitoring to ensure compliance with regulations: data 
monitoring, administrative monitoring, and safety monitoring. 
15.1 DATA MONITORING  
In order to ensure a well -controlled clinical trial, JJSV will follow specific data monit oring 
procedures, routinely generate reports and periodically review safety and effectiveness 
data.  To avoid bias, any analyses generated prior to site closures will not be disseminated to any of the investigative sites.  
To minimize data omissions and inconsistencies on clinical reports and to ensure that data are accurately transcribed to computer data files, JJSV will follow internal data processing procedures that include automated and manual quality control checks to identify any data discrepancies.  Any such items will be resolved and documented as needed on the case report forms at the investigative site and in the data management 
system at JJSV. 
Prevention of Missing Data  
Methods used to safeguard against missing data that can have deleterious effects on the 
study integrity and reliability of its outcomes will include training study staff with 
centralized and on- site programs.  In addition, subjects will be encouraged at the time of 
informed consent to avoid missing study visits, as missing data may affect the study reliability and diminish the scientific value of their contribution to the study.  
15.2 ADMINISTRATIVE MONITORING  
Administrative monitoring procedures will ensure that study devices, subjects, and forms can be traced and will allow monitor ing of investigator progress and compliance.  
Accountability and traceability of study devices will be monitored, as needed for compliance with study requirements . 
Device Accountability  
Complete Activator accountability will be maintained at the investigative site by 
maintaining records of investigational product received from and returned to JJSV.   A 
site log will be used to track investigational equipment for date of receipt, use and 
disposition/return t o JJSV.  This site log and any other investigational product 
information will be maintained in the study binder and monitored by JJSV personnel.  
JOHNSON & JOHNSON SURGICAL VISION  CONFIDENTIAL  
Version 3.0  / Aug/31/2020                                                      24                                                    PR/DRYE -105-ACTS  During periodic investigative site monitoring visits, JJSV personnel will review 
investigative product inventory records and logs to ensure Activator accountability 
compliance and complete investigational traceability .   
Site Monitoring Plan  
Prior to performing site initiation, the requirements of the study and reporting 
mechanisms will be explained to each investigator.  When necessary, a pre- study site 
qualification visit may be performed to assess the adequacy of the site to perform the study for sites that have not previously worked with JJSV or have undergone significant changes or have not been visited in the past year.  A study initiation visit may be 
conducted prior to the first treatment.  
Throughout the duration of the study, the compliance to this protocol will be monitored 
remotely or at each investigative site.  During interim site monitoring visits, JJ SV will 
review informed consent documents and subject eligibility, and the data on study case report forms will be verified against subject charts and other source documents to ensure complete and accurate reporting.  The subject files will also be reviewed to assure that all adverse events and any issues encountered with JJSV products have been reported in a timely fashion.  
JJSV will also review source documents to verify that all required items have been documented in the subject medical charts.  Refer to Section 14.1, Source Documents, 
for a list of items that are required for source documentation.   
Training on study -specific procedures may also be conducted during monitoring visits.  
Upon study completion, a final close- out site visit to each site will be made to monitor the 
last of the subject data records and finalize any outstanding study issues.  
A separate Study Monitoring Plan will be established prior to study start that will define 
the type and frequency of monitoring visits and frequency of record monitoring.    
15.3 Safety Monitoring  
The medical monitor will review results throughout the clinical trial as necessary to 
ensure the continued safety of the device and to ensure that no subjects are exposed to unreasonable risk.  The medical monitor will be available to answer all questions 
from investigators.  The medical monitor will review and assess any reports of serious 
and/or device- related adverse events as well as device deficiencies that could have 
led to a serious adverse event and discuss these with the reporting investigator(s) as necessary.  The medical monitor, as well as any other qualified personnel designated by JJSV, shall also review any interim progress reports, as applicable.

POTENTIAL RISKS AND RISK MANAGEMENT  
RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH USE OF LIPIFLOW  
The use of the LipiFlow System in this study is non- significant risk.  No device -related 
serious adverse events are anticipated with the use of the LipiFlow system. Transient, 
non-serious adverse events which may result from the use of the LipiFlow system 
include, but are not limited to, the onset or increase in the following ocular signs or symptoms that  are either 1) clinically significant as determined by the Investigator, or 2) 
require medical treatment for resolution:  
• Eyelid/eye pain requiring discontinuation of the treatment procedure;  
• Eyelid irritation or inflammation (e.g., edema, bruising, blood blister, dermatitis, 
hordeolum or chalazion);  
• Ocular surface irritation or inflammation (e.g., corneal abrasion, conjunctival edema 
or conjunctival injection/hyperemia); and 
• Ocular symptoms (e.g., burning, stinging, tearing, itching, discharge, redness, foreign body sensation, visual disturbance, sensitivity to light).  
RISK MANAGEMENT  
Subjects will be closely monitored thr oughout  the trial duration. The occurrence of 
adverse events and complaints will be assessed at each study visit and reported to JJSV according to Section 11.0, Adverse Events and Product Complaints.  Additionally, JJSV 
will monitor incoming data following the procedures outlined in Section 15.0, Monitoring.  
The Medical Monitor will ensure subjects are not exposed to additional risks by 
monitoring serious adverse events, device- related adverse events, and device-
deficiencies that could have led to serious adverse events (Section 15.3, Safety Monitoring).  
POTENTIAL BENEFITS 
There may not be any direct  benefit  for the subjects participating in the clinical study. 
The study will provide data to confirm the clinical use of the LipiFlow system with Activator LFD -2100 to successfully complete a LipiFlow treatment procedure in human 
subjects. 
CONCLUSION 
The hazards/risks associated with the LipiFlow system are acceptable.  The 
hazards/risks associated with the Activator Model LFD -2100  were mitigated to as low as 
possible, and residual risks were addressed via risk -benefits analysis.  The conclusion of 
the risk -benefits analysis was that the benefit gained from testing the Activator LFD -2100 
in the study outweighs the relatively low risk of harm after all mitigations are implemented when the devices are used as intended.

accordance with the IRB and regulations of the FDA.  The study will be terminated if causality is shown to be related to the study device.  
Additionally, the investigator, or JJSV, may stop a subject’s participation at any time.  JJSV may also stop the study at any time for reasons it determines appropriate.  However, no suspension of the study would be made to disadvantage the study subjects.  Following suspension of the study for any reason, all study subjects who have 
already received treatment would continue to be followed through completion of the 
study visit schedule.   
20.0 STATISTICAL METHODS  
20.1 ANALYSIS POPULATION  
All treated subjects will be included in the analysis population.  All the questionnai re 
responses and the treatment  reports generated by LipiFlow system after completion of 
treatment will be collected and analyzed to confirm successful completion of the 
procedure.  Questionnaire responses for each item and data from the treatment  reports 
will be summarized for Activator LFD -2100.  No imputations for missing values will be 
used.  
20.2 STUDY E NDPOINTS  
Primary Endpoint:  
 Successful completion of LipiFlow treatment with Activator LFD- 2100 in 95% or 
more cases.  
The treatment reports automatically generated by LipiFlow Console after 
completion of each treatment  will show if the treatment  completion is successful . 
The frequency and proportion of successful completion  of treatment  will be 
reported.  The expected proportion of successful completion of LipiFlow 
treatment question will be greater than or equal to 95%.  
Other Endpoints:  
 Questionnaire rating of each step in the LipiFlow treatment procedure with Activator LFD -2100.  
For questions with a ‘Yes’ or ‘No’ response, the frequency and proportion of each 
question with response ‘Yes’ will be reported.  For questions with five level s of

 Version 3.0  / Aug/31/2020                                                             39                                                       PR/DRYE-105-ACTS 
 There are approximately 20 to 30 meibomian glands along the lower eyelid.  The Investigator or 
designee assesses 15 glands located temporally, centrally and nasally, as shown in Figure 2. 
The central region of the Meibomian Gland Evaluator should be carefully placed in the temporal, 
central and nasal regions as described in this procedure to avoid overlap in the gland 
assessment.   
 
 
The following procedure is used for examination and grading of meibomian gland function.  
1. Under the slit -lamp biomicroscope 10x to 16x magnification, locate the temporal region of 
the lower eyelid and observe 5 consecutive glands orifices in this region.  
2. Holding the Meibomian Gland Evaluator between the forefinger and the thumb, place the 
instrument contact surface onto the skin immediately below the lash line of the lower eyelid 
so that the long dimension is parallel to the eyelid margin, and the five glands are in the 
central region of the Meibomian Gland Evaluator.  
3. Once full contact is achieved between the Meibomian Gland Evaluator contact surface and 
the outer skin of the lower eyelid, rotate the shaft of the Meibomian Gland Evaluator 
downward approximately 15 to 45 degrees so that it is tangential to the eyeball.  
4. Depress the Meibomian Gland Evaluator to exert a constant force over the meibomian 
glands. Adjust the position of the Meibomian Gland Evaluator to cause the flat surface of the 
lower eyelid margin to roll slightly outward, facilitating a clear view of the meibomian gland orifices.  
5. To facilitate observation of the gland secretions, gently wipe the gland orifices along the eyelid margin clean with a dry cotton swab immediately after applying pressure while 
maintaining the Meibomian Gland Evaluator in position and maintaining pressure.

 6. Hold the Meibomian Gland Evaluator in place over the meibomian glands for a minimum of 
10 and a maximum of 15 seconds while evaluating the secretion characteristics from each meibomian gland. The expressed secretion from each gland is graded according to the 
characteristics displayed in Table 1.

Grade Secretion Characteristics  
3 Clear liquid oil secretion     
2 Colored/cloudy liquid secretion  
1 Inspissated (toothpaste -consistency) secretion  
0 No secretion (includes capped orifices)

 APPENDIX F   INSTRUCTIONS FOR OCULAR SURFACE STAINING  
CORNEAL STAINING  
The Investigator or designee assesses the corneal staining after instillation of fluorescein dye in 
the eye using the following method.  
1. Place one drop of commercially available saline on a standard fluorescein strip.  Take care 
to avoid applying the saline to the fluorescein strip holder. Do not shake the strip. Wait ten seconds after application of the saline before proceeding.  
2. Instruct the patient to look down and towards the opposite hand from the eye receiving the stain. It may be helpful to ask the subject to fixate on his/her own thumb. Place the subject’s thumb to rest on the opposite leg to achieve inferior fixation of approximately 45 degrees down and 20 degrees nasal.  
3. Retract the upper eyelid. Introduce the fluorescein strip at an approximate 30- degree angle 
and touch the superior temporal bulbar conjunctiva, preferably 4 mm or more from the limbus, for 2 seconds, so that 1- 2 mm of the flat side makes contact with the ocular surface. 
Withdraw the strip and release the upper lid.  
NOTE: If the size of the strip prevents application to the desired position on the superior 
temporal bulbar conjunctiva, apply the strip to a location on the bulbar conjunctiva 
as close as possible to the preferred position.   
4. Instruct the subject to close the eyelids completely three times.  Wait 1.5 minutes (90 seconds) before evaluating the ocular surface for staining.  
5. To observe the fluorescein staining, evaluate the subject’s eye under the slit -lamp 
biomicroscope using a cobalt blue filter transmitting 330 to 400 nm and a beam approximately 4 mm wide and l0 mm high.  
6. Examine the entire cornea. Grade the corneal staining observed in the central, inferior, nasal, temporal and superior regions as shown in Figure 4 on a scale of 0 to 3 based on the 
Report of the National Eye Institute/Industry Workshop on Clinical Trials in Dry Eye.  Document the staining grade.

 CONJUNCTIVAL STAINING  
The Investigator or designee assesses the conjunctival staining after instillation of lissamine green 
dye in the eye using the following method.  
1. Place one drop of commercially available saline on a standard lissamine green strip.  Take 
care to avoid applying the saline to the strip holder. Do not shake the strip. Wait ten seconds 
after application of the saline before proceeding.  
2. Instruct the patient to look down and towards the opposite hand from the eye receiving the 
stain. It may be helpful to ask the subject to fixate on his/her own thumb. Place the subject’s 
thumb to rest on the opposite leg to achieve inferior fixation of approximately 45 degrees down and 20 degrees nasal.  
3. Retract the upper eyelid. Introduce the strip at an approximate 30- degree angle and touch 
the superior temporal bulbar conjunctiva, preferably 4 mm or more from the limbus, for 2 seconds, so that 1- 2 mm of the flat side makes contact with the ocular surface. Withdraw the 
strip and release the upper lid.  
NOTE: If the size of the strip prevents application to the desired position on the superior 
temporal bulbar conjunctiva, apply the strip to a location on the bulbar conjunctiva 
as close as possible to the preferred position.   
4. Instruct the subject to close the eyelids completely three times.  Wait 1.5 minutes (90 seconds) before evaluating the ocular surface for staining.  
5. To observe the lissamine green staining, evaluate the subject’s eye under the slit -lamp 
biomicroscope with a beam approximately 4 mm wide and l0 mm high.  
6. Examine the entire bulbar conjunctiva. Grade the conjunctival staining observed in the six regions as shown in Figure 5 on a scale of 0 to 3 based on the Report of the National Eye 
Institute/Industry Workshop on Clinical Trials in Dry Eye. Document the staining grade.

Confidentia l and Proprietary  Page 6 of 23                                                       Version 1.0  06 APR  2016 1  BACKGROUND INFORMATI ON 
Non -invasive treatment options are in high demand by pa tients wanting to improve the appearance of their skin 
without surgical intervention. As a result, patients now have a variety of opt ions for non -invasive skin treatments , 
from laser and light -based tr eatments to devices that utilize ultrasound and radiofrequency, however this was not 
always the case. Initial skin improvement  procedures utilized ablative lasers, such as the carbon dioxide (CO 2) and 
erbium:yttrium -aluminum -garnet (Er:YAG), and resulted in substantial improvement in skin appearance, texture, 
rhytides and laxity [1-3]. However, s ince ablative treatments destroy the epidermal layer of the skin in order to 
penetrate and heat the deeper dermal layers, ample post -procedure recovery time is required and patients may 
experience side effects lasting for a few weeks. Furthermore, hypo - or hyperpigmentation, prolonged wound 
healing and even scarring can occur following ablative procedures [ 4-6]. Treatment methods with less risk of side 
effects and post -treatment down t ime are in high demand. As such, the choices are vast and varied, ranging from 
fractional non -ablative laser devices to those that use radiofrequency [ 7-15]. Fractional lasers inflict microscopic 
zones of thermal damage in the dermal layers of the skin without destruction of the epidermis, thereby reducing 
recovery time significantly as compared to ablative procedures [16]. Treatment with n on-fractional, non -ablative 
laser devices requires little to no post -procedure recovery time. Nonablative lasers of vari ous wavelengths are 
effective for improvement of skin appearance  based on the principle of selective photothermolysis, whereby laser 
light is absorbed by hemoglobin in blood vessels and melanin in pigment -producing skin cells [ 17, 18]. Absorption 
of laser light by these molecular chromophores results in the production of heat, leading to destruction of unwanted blood vessels and pigment cells. Heat production within the dermis by the laser light also results in immediate collagen contraction and heat -induced wound healing that, over time, causes a cascade of cellular 
events leadin g to new collagen production and improved skin appearance [ 8, 10, 19-23].

6.1 Reporting of Adverse Events  
If any serious adverse event (SAE), anticipated or unanticipated, occurs at any time during or after the use of the 
device within the study period, the investigator must report it to Cutera within 24 hours using the Cutera Seri ous 
Adverse Event Report Form.  
If the SAE is unanticipated in nature, severity or degree of incidence, C utera will notify all events that fulfill the 
following criteria to the Institutional Review Board (IRB) within ten (10) working days using the IRB Unanticipated 
Problem/Event Report Form:  
• Serious  (i.e., death, a life -threatening adverse experience, inpati ent hospitalization or prolongation of 
existing hospitalization, a persistent or significant disability or incapacity, or a congenital anomaly or birth 
defect) [21 CFR 312.32(a)], AND  
• Unexpected  (i.e., not described in the Informed Consent Document), AND 
• Related  to the study design, procedures, or device (possibly, probably or definitely related, or unknown).  
OR 
• Any event that, in the opinion of the investigator, may adversely affect the rights, welfare or safety of 
subjects in the study.  
6.2 Follow -up of Subjects after AEs  
All reported AEs should be followed until resolution or until the subject’s participation in the study ends.  All AEs 
assessed by the investigator as probably related or possibly related to the study device should be followed until 
they resolve or until the investigator assesses them as “chronic” or “stable”.  Resolutions of such events are to be 
documented on the appropriate CRF pages.  All AEs that result in permanent discontinuation from this clinical 
trial, whether serious or not, should also be reported on the Subject Non -Completion of Study Form.

The investigator participating in this study was  chosen based on extensive and safe experience with the use of lasers 
in der matology applications. This is the most critical element in managing subject risk. In addition, study 
investigators will be trained on the use of both the Cutera Enlighten and E xcel V laser  system s by a representative 
of Cutera.  
8 TRAINING AND MONITORING  
 
 
 
9  DATA ANALYSIS PLAN  
9.1 Sample Size  Calculation  
The planned sample size of up to 2 4 subjects for each laser cohort was determined based on clinical judgment to 
provide sufficient information to evaluate reduction in the  number of lentigines in the hands.  
9.2 Data Analysis  
Descriptive statistics and 95% confidence intervals and will be calculated for percent reduction in the number of 
hand lentigines, at 4 weeks   
Descript ive statistics and 95% confidence intervals and will be calculated separately for improvement in skin 
texture, and overall appearance of the hands, based on the Physician’s Global Improvement Assessment evaluation, and also for the Subject Satisfaction Scale evaluations.  
Safety measures include the incidence of treatment- related AEs, the proportion of subjects who prematurely 
terminate from the study due to a treatment-related AE

The Internat
ional Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) member journals have adopted a trials registration 
policy as a condition for publication. This policy requires that all clinical trials be registered in a public trials registry 
such as ClinicalTrials.gov, which is sponsored by the National Library of Medicine. It is the responsibility of the 
sponsor to register thi s trial in ClinicalTrials.gov. Any clinical trial starting enrollment after September 27, 2007 must 
be registered either on or before the onset of patient enrollment.

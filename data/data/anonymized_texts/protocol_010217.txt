Version Date:  8.31.2020 – Amendment12 71.0 INTRODUCTION – BACKGROUND & RATIONALE
1.1 Breast Cancer: All Subtypes Not Equal
Breast  cancer  is the most  common non-dermatological malignancy in women with an 
estimated 232, 670 new diagnoses in 2014, and the second  leading cause of cancer  
death in women with an estimated 40, 000 women in the United States succumbing to 
the disease  in 2014 [1] . Breast  cancer is a heterogeneous  disease comprising of several  
molecular subtypes, which are commonly extrapolated into clinical  subtypes,  with 
significant prognostic implications [2, 3] . Significant advances  have been made in certain  
subtypes of breast cancer, for example human epidermal growth factor 2-neu (HER2)  
receptor positive disease.  In this subtype targeted therapies have changed  the nature  of 
the disease from an aggressive subtype to one which is highly curable in early stages,  
and in some patients with advanced metastatic disease treatable for many years [4] . The 
estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) positive subtypes also have  
several targeted therapies using hormonal  manipulation, however, when the disease  
becomes metastatic all patients  will eventually develop endocrine resistance and often  
require cytotoxic chemotherapy [5] . Similarly,  patients with ER, PR, and HER2  negative,  
the so-called triple negative  breast cancers (TNBC), biologically tend to display an 
aggressive phenotype, currently do not have targeted therapy options as a standard  of 
care, and only have a limited  amount of cytotoxic agents  available to treat their disease  
[6]. Patients with metastatic ER positive breast cancer who have used all hormonal  
options, and those with TNBC, experience a poor prognosis with only a few treatment  
options.
1.2 Breast Cancer Immunology
The breast  tumor  microenvironment is often infiltrated  by immune cells.  The adaptive  
immune system can identify  tumor antigens through immunosurveillence [7] . In this 
process, antigen-presenting  cells present non-self  antigens  to T cells,  which allow  them  
to recognize and destroy cells expressing such antigens. A hallmark of oncogenesis is 
that tumor cells can develop mechanisms to evade such immune recognition [8, 9] .
The presence  of tumor  infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) has been associated  with more  
favorable prognosis in breast cancer [10] . Paradoxically,  TILs have been closely  
associated with ER negative subtypes, tumors with an aggressive biological behavior.  
However,  this discrepancy may be due to the fact TILs are associated  with better survival  
in basal-like  rather than non-basal-like TNBC [11, 12] . Nevertheless, these results  
highlight  the importance of immune regulatory mechanisms in the pathogenesis of breast  
cancer.
1.3 Immune Checkpoint Blockade in Breast Cancer
The success  of immune checkpoint blockade  in certain cancers has served as proof-of-  
concept that immune therapy  is a viable therapeutic  strategy.  Cytotoxic T lymphocyte  
antigen 4 (CTLA-4) inhibitors have shown significant and sustained anti-tumor activity  in 
melanoma [12] . While clinical data regarding  CTLA-4 inhibition in breast cancer is limited,  
preclinical studies using mammary murine models  using poorly immunogenic breast  
cancer cell lines failed to show single agent activity,  however, in combination with 
radiation therapy improved survival related to a decrease in lung metastases  [13].
Another study  demonstrated significant tumor regression with the combination  of a 
granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor vaccine  and CTLA-4 blockade  [14]. A 
phase I clinical trial of 26 patients with hormone  receptor positive metastatic  breast  
cancer found that treatment with the a humanized  immunoglobulin (Ig) IgG2  monoclonal  
antibody (mAb), tremelimumab and exemestane found that this treatment could illicit a 
robust  immune  response as measured by systemic immune effectors,  and 42% of 
patients experienced disease stability for at least 3 months, thus demonstrating  possible  
biological and clinical activity  [15].
PD-L1 is  part of a complex system of receptors and ligands that are involved in controlling

Version Date:  8.31.2020 – Amendment12 8T-cell activation. The PD-1  receptor (CD279) is expressed on the surface of activated
T-cells[16]. It  has 2 known ligands: PD-L1 (B7 H1; CD274) and PD-L2 (B7 DC; CD273) 
[17]. The PD-1 and PD-L1/PD-L2 belong to the family of immune checkpoint proteins that 
act as co-inhibitory factors, which can halt or limit the development of T-cell response. 
When PD-L1 binds to PD-1, an inhibitory signal is transmitted into the T-cell, which 
reduces cytokine production and suppresses T-cell proliferation. Tumor cells exploit this 
immune checkpoint pathway as a mechanism to evade detection and inhibit immune 
response. PD-L1 is constitutively expressed by B cells, dendritic cells, and macrophages 
[18].Importantly, PD-L1 is commonly over expressed on tumor cells or on non-transformed 
cells in the tumor microenvironment [19]. PD-L1 expressed on the tumor cells binds to
PD-1 receptors  on the activated T-cells leading to the inhibition of cytotoxic T-cells. These 
deactivated T-cells remain inhibited in the tumour microenvironment. The PD-1/PD-L1 
pathway represents an adaptive immune resistance mechanism that is exerted by tumor 
cells in response to endogenous anti-tumor activity. In contrast, cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-
associated antigen-4 (CTLA-4) is constitutively expressed by regulatory T-cells and 
upregulated on activated T cells. Binding of CTLA-4 to CD80 or CD86 on IC leads to 
inhibition of T-cell activation [20]. The inhibitory mechanism described above is co-opted 
by tumors that express PD-L1 as a way of evading immune detection and elimination. The 
binding of an anti-PD-L1 agent to the PD-L1 receptor inhibits the interaction of PD-L1 with 
the PD-1 and CD80 receptors expressed on ICs. This activity overcomes PD-L1-mediated 
inhibition of antitumour immunity. While functional blockade of PD-L1 results in T-cell 
reactivation, this mechanism of action is different from direct agonism of a stimulatory 
receptor such as CD28 .
When this  study was designed and launched (2015), the clinical scenario was that, 
blockade of the programmed cell death 1 (PD-1)  and its ligand (PD-L1) had been  found  
to have anti-tumor  activity in certain cancers, with 6-17%  overall response rates  [21]. 
Approximately 20% of TNBC expresses PD-L1, suggesting that targeting  the PD- 1/PD-
L1 checkpoint may be an effective treatment  strategy in this subtype  [22, 23] .
Expression of  PD-L1 is known to be associated with poor prognosis in patients with breast  
cancer,  particularly those with luminal B and basal-like subtypes [24] , thus making 
aggressive  phenotype ER positive  and triple negative breast cancers attractive subtypes 
in which to investigate PD-L1 blockade. A subsequent  phase 1B study presented at the 
2014 San Antonio  Breast  Cancer Symposium  demonstrated that in patients with heavily  
pretreated  metastatic triple negative  breast cancer (TNBC)  treated with the humanized 
IgG4κ  isotype mAb against PD-1, pembrolizumab,  16.1% had a partial response (PR),  
and 9.7% had stable disease (SD) [25] .
Through the years, the clinical landscape has evolved. Original  study (Santa-Maria et al 
Oncotarget 2018) found that patients who responded had only had 1 line of prior therapy. 
We thus want to limit to no more than 1 line of previous therapy in the metastatic setting. 
Indeed several studies have now shown that responses to immune checkpoint inhibition 
are mostly restricted to earlier lines settings (Santa-Maria et al JNCCN 2019). 
Currently, atezolizumab  in combination with nab-paclitaxel is FDA-approved for patients 
with no prior treatment for metastatic TNBC who are PD-L1 immune cell-positive. The 
ImPassion130 study (Schmid et al NEJM 2018) suggests that these patients benefit from 
the addition of atezolizumab to nab-paclitaxel in the front line setting. Therefore, now we 
wish to exclude patients who are PD-L1-positive in the front line setting. Patients who are 
PD-L1-negative are eligible for this protocol in the front line setting, if patients are enrolled 
in the second line setting, PDL1 status is not needed for enrollment.
Although effects  of single agent checkpoint blockade are modest, with only a small  
fraction of patients having significant responses, recently combination checkpoint  
blockade with CTLA-4 and PD-1 inhibitors has demonstrated synergistic activity  with an 
overall response rate of 40%, and 31% of patients achieving >80% reduction in their 
tumors by 12 weeks [26] . A recently presented phase 1 open-label study evaluating the 
anti-PDL1 inhibitor, durvalumab, in combination  with tremelimumab in patients with 
advanced non-small cell lung cancer, revealed that the combination was well tolerated  
with 75% of reported adverse events (AEs) being  low grade, and only 3/24 patients  
discontinuing therapy due to treatment-related AEs.  Furthermore, patients experienced an

Version Date:  8.31.2020 – Amendment12 9overall response  rate (ORR) of 30% in the subset of patients that were PD-L1 negative 
[27] . These results suggest  that combination  immune therapy may improve anti- tumor 
responses.
1.4 Durvalumab (MEDI4736)
The non-clinical  and clinical experience is fully described in the current version of the 
durvalumab Investigator’s Brochure (IB).  
Durvalumab is  a human monoclonal antibody (mAb) of the immunoglobulin G (IgG) 1 
kappa subclass that inhibits binding of PD-L1 and is being developed by 
AstraZeneca/MedImmune for use in the treatment of cancer.  (MedImmune is a wholly 
owned subsidiary of AstraZeneca; AstraZeneca/MedImmune will be referred to as 
AstraZeneca throughout this document.)  As durvalumab is an engineered mAb, it does 
not induce antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity or complement-dependent cytotoxicity.  
The proposed mechanism of action for durvalumab is interference of the interaction of PD-
L1.
Durvalumab (MEDI4736)  is a human  IgG1κ  monoclonal  antibody directed  against 
human PD-L1.  Two monotherapy studies ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED] and [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]), and one 
combination study  ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED])  investigating this drug are currently  underway.  
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED] is a first- time-in-human, dose-escalation and dose-expansion study in 
adults with advanced solid tumors. [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] is a Phase 1, dose-escalation and 
dose-expansion study in Japanese adults with advanced  solid tumors. [STUDY_ID_REMOVED],  is 
a Phase 1 study  investigating durvalumab  in combination with MEDI6469,  as well as 
other immune  therapies,  in patients with advanced  malignancies.
1.5 Tremelimumab
The non-clinical  and clinical experience is fully described in the current version of the 
tremelimumab Investigator’s Brochure (IB).
Tremelimumab is  an IgG 2 kappa isotype mAb directed against the cytotoxic T-
lymphocyte- associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) also known as CD152 (cluster of 
differentiation 152)  This is an immunomodulatory therapy (IMT) that is being developed 
by AstraZeneca for use in the treatment of cancer. As described above, tremelimumab 
has been safely  administered in patients with metastatic breast  cancer and, in 
combination with hormone  therapy,  associated with significant clinical benefit in terms of 
disease stability  [15].
Tremelimumab has been  administered as monotherapy to subjects participating in 10 
clinical studies, with over 1,000  subjects in a variety of tumor types.  Across the clinical  
development program for tremelimumab and that of the related anti-CTLA-4  antibody  
ipilimumab, a pattern of efficacy has emerged  that appears to be consistent  across tumor  
types for this mechanism of action.  Response  rates to anti-CTLA-4 antibody  monotherapy 
are generally low, approximately 10%.  However,  in subjects who respond,  the responses 
are generally  durable,  lasting months to years even in subjects with aggressive  tumors, 
such as refractory metastatic melanoma. The most  common  treatment-related toxicity is 
diarrhea (41.2%), rash (27.2%), pruritus (25.1%), fatigue  (23.8%),  nausea (21.9%), 
vomiting (13.5%), decreased appetite (11.3%), headache (7.2%), pyrexia (7.0%),  
abdominal pain (6.7%),  and colitis resulting in hypokalemia (5.5%).
1.6 Durvalumab in combination with tremelimumab
Targeting both  PD-1 and CTLA-4 pathways may have additive or synergistic activity [19] 
because the mechanisms of action of CTLA-4 and PD-1 are non-redundant; therefore, 
AstraZeneca is also investigating the use of durvalumab + tremelimumab combination 
therapy for the treatment of cancer.
1.7 Rationale for the Current Study
The association of the PD-1/PD-L1  axis in breast cancer, and early success of inhibitors  
of the PD1/PD-L1  axis in breast cancer, provides  background rationale for the use of

Version Date:  8.31.2020 – Amendment12 10durvalumab in patients  with metastatic breast cancer. Recent studies published in 
melanoma suggest that the combination of the PD-1 inhibitor, nivolumab, in combination 
with the CTLA-4 inhibitor, ipilimumab, have improved progression free survival compared 
to single agent ipilimumab (11.5 months versus 2.9 months, respectively)[28]. 
Furthermore, a recent phase 1 study presented at the European Society for Medical 
Oncology (ESMO) found that in patients with metastatic lung cancer, the combination of 
durvalumab and tremelimumab found this combination was tolerable and associated with 
overall response rates of 28% [27]. The significant  synergy in response  rates observed 
with inhibition of CTLA-4 and the PD-1/PD-L1 axis in other malignancies  supports the 
investigation of this combination in metastatic breast cancer.
1.7.1 Rationale for  fixed dosing for durvalumab and tremelimumab
A population  PK model was developed for durvalumab using monotherapy data 
from a Phase 1 study (study 1108; N=292; doses= 0.1 to 10 mg/kg Q2W or 15 
mg/kg Q3W; solid tumors). Population PK analysis indicated only minor impact of 
body weight (WT) on PK of durvalumab (coefficient of ≤ 0.5). The impact of body 
WT-based (10 mg/kg Q2W) and fixed dosing (750 mg Q2W) of durvalumab was 
evaluated by comparing predicted steady state PK concentrations (5th, median and 
95th percentiles) using the population PK model. A fixed dose of 750 mg was 
selected to approximate 10 mg/kg (based on median body WT of ~75 kg). A total of 
1000 patients were simulated using body WT distribution of 40–120 kg..  Simulation 
results demonstrate that body weight-based (10 mg/kg Q2W) and fixed dosing (750 
mg Q2W) regimens yield similar median steady-state exposures and associated
variability, supporting  the potential switch of durvalumab from weight-based to fixed 
dose. Similar considerations hold for the Q4W dosing regimens (20 mg/kg Q4W 
versus 1500 mg Q4W).
A population  PK model was developed for durvalumab using monotherapy data as 
detailed in Section 5.1.2 of the IB. Population PK analysis indicated only minor
impact of  body weight on PK of durvalumab (coefficient of ≤0.5).  The impact of 
body weight--based (10 mg/kg Q2W or 20 mg/kg Q4W) and fixed dosing (750 mg 
Q2W or 1500 mg Q4W) of durvalumab was evaluated by comparing predicted 
steady state PK concentrations exposures (AUCss,0-28, Cmax,ss, and Cmin,ss5th, 
median and 95th percentiles) using the population PK model.
A fixed  dose of 750 mg Q2W was selected to approximate 10 mg/kg Q2W and a 
fixed dose of 1500 mg Q4W was selected to approximate 20 mg/kg Q4W (based on 
median body weight of ~75 kg). A total of 1000 patients were simulated using body 
weight distribution of 40 to 120 110 kg. Simulation results demonstrate that body 
weight-based (10 mg/kg Q2W) and fixed dosing (750 mg Q2W) regimens yield 
similar median steady-state exposures and associated variability, supporting the 
potential switch of durvalumab from weight-based to fixed dose.
Similar considerations  hold for the Q4W dosing regimens (20 mg/kg Q4W versus 
1500 mg Q4W).
Similar findings have  been reported by others [29-32]. Wang and colleagues 
investigated 12 monoclonal antibodies and found that fixed and body size-based 
dosing perform similarly, with fixed dosing being better for 7 of 12 antibodies. In 
addition, they investigated 18 therapeutic proteins and peptides and showed that 
fixed dosing performed better for 12 of 18 in terms of reducing the between-subject 
variability in pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamics parameters [31]. 
A fixed  dosing approach is preferred by the prescribing community due to ease of 
use and reduced dosing errors. Given expectation of similar pharmacokinetic 
exposure and variability, we considered it feasible to switch to fixed dosing 
regimens. Based on average body WT of 75 kg, a fixed dose of 750 mg Q2W 
MEDI4736 (equivalent to 10 mg/kg Q2W), 1500 mg Q4W durvalumab (equivalent to 
20 mg/kg Q4W) and 75 mg Q4W tremelimumab (equivalent to 1 mg/kg Q4W) is 
included in the current study.

> 30kg body weight due to endotoxin exposure.  Patients with a body weight less 
than or equal to 30 kg will be excluded. 
1.7.2 Rationale for  dose and regimen selection
The dose  levels selected for this combination of Durvalumab and Tremelimumab 
were based on a recent phase 1 study (Antonio et al. ESMO 2014, poster 
attached), which determined the maximal tolerated dose (MTD) of the 
combination. The combination was found to be safe and tolerable. Based on the 
phase 1 study of this combination (Antonio et al. ESMO 2014), we aim to treat 
for a total of 12 months of therapy. This regimen was associated with continued 
disease control at over 32 weeks (Figure 3 of abstract), and overall response 
rate of 28%. In light of this information, our treatment plan includes an induction 
period of 4 weeks of combination therapy, followed by maintenance 
monotherapy with durvalumab up to 12 months total (or approximately 18 
doses). 
The rationale for  maintenance therapy with single-agent durvalumab is based on 
previous experience with immunotherapies. Response to immunotherapy may 
be delayed compared to conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy, and even appear 
as pseudoprogression (radiographic increase in the size of lesion due to T 
lymphocyte infiltration) before patients experience durable responses; to capture 
these delayed responses, the immune-related RECIST criteria have been 
developed (PMID 19934295). Because of the delayed response to 
immunotherapy, this study includes additional therapy using maintenance 
durvalumab after the 4 cycles of combination tremelimumab with durvalumab. 
Furthermore, in the phase 1 study where durvalumab was investigated with 
tremelimumab using various schedules (Antonio et al. ESMO meeting 2014), the 
regimen where there was least toxicity and greatest efficacy seen was when 
there was an induction of durvalumab with trememlimumab for 4 cycles, 
followed by durvalumab maintenance to complete 12 months of therapy. 
Continuing tremelimumab additionally for 12 months was associated with 
increased toxicity, therefore, we do not propose adding trememlimumab to 
durvalumab to the maintenance regimen in this study.  
Pseudoprogression has  been well-described in various studies in investigating 
checkpoint inhibitors, and refers to the inflammatory response that looks like 
progression of disease. This phenomenon is actually seen in the phase 1 study 
this proposal is based on (Figure 4 on abstract), but has also been observed in 
numerous other trials (PMID: 21785048). It crucial for drug development of 
immunotherapy to capture pseudoprogression in a safe manner, therefore this 
proposal has been designed to anticipate pseudoprogression and allow for 
continued treatment provided that very specific criteria are met. 
1.7.3 Rationale  for Expansion Cohort
Based on  initial portion of the study where the first 18 evaluable patients were 
investigated, a striking difference between overall response rates in ER-positive 
and TNBC was observed (Table 1). The ORR in ER-positive was 0%, and in 
TNBC it was 42.9%. Furthermore, the TNBC group had 2 patients with SD 
(clinical benefit rate of 71.4%), and one of the patients listed as PD, in fact had 
pseudoprogression (after 2 months had sub-centimeter LNs enlarge to >15mm, 
captured as PD per RECIST, but afterwards experience stability in these 
lesions, and a PR in target lesions). While the numbers are small, there is a 
clear signal in the TNBC cohort since essentially 6 out of 7 patient experienced 
clinically relevant benefit. Immunotherapy is rapidly evolving in breast cancer, 
and these initial results show promise in this cohort of patients, and the rationale 
of the expansion cohort is to capitalize on this initial experience.

1.8 Rationale for Exploratory Objectives
Immune-related biomarkers
Predictive biomarkers  are needed to identify which patients are more likely to experience 
clinical benefit. A critical barrier in the development of immunotherapies for the treatment 
of cancer is the identification of predictive biomarkers to therapy since to date only a small 
proportion of patients derive benefit to immunotherapies. While some studies have shown 
PD-L1 overexpression by immunohistochemistry is associated with response, other 
studies have shown that patients with PD-L1 negative tumors may also exhibit significant 
response suggesting that PD-L1 expression alone may not fully predict response to 
therapy [33, 34]. Therefore, more accurate biomarkers predictive of response or urgently 
needed [ 35]. 
Immune cells  identify cancer cells by detecting antigens, termed neoantigens, expressed 
on cancer cells. Higher mutational burden may correlate with more diverse neoantigen 
landscapes and predict responses to immunotherapy in patients with melanoma and lung 
cancer [36, 37]. Mutational burden may also be assessed on circulating tumor DNA. 
Similarly, patients with mismatch repair-deficient cancers have a higher number of somatic 
mutations compared to those who are mismatch repair-proficient, but furthermore, they 
have better responses to immune checkpoint blockade [11]. Diverse neoantigen 
landscapes are more likely to stimulate neoantigen-specific T cells, which can be 
measured through T cell receptor sequencing to quantify the clonality of the T cell receptor 
repertoire. Preliminary studies in patients with melanoma and lung cancer suggest that 
patients with oligoclonal T cell receptor repertoires are more likely to respond to 
immunotherapy [37, 38]. These immunopharmacogenomic biomarkers may, therefore, 
help identify patients with breast cancer more likely to benefit from immunotherapies. 
The relationship  between clonal expansion of the T cell receptor repertoire has been 
studied in patients receiving neoadjuvant therapy in early stage breast cancer. Matched 
samples of patients with early stage breast cancer of various subtypes and assessed the T 
cell receptor populations at baseline and after various chemotherapy regimens. Using the 
diversity index, which assesses T cell beta-receptor clonal diversity, clonal expansion was 
found to be associated with complete and partial responses [39]. In addition, gene 
expression profiling of immune relevant genes can be modulated by immunotherapy and 
be associated with outcomes, including CD8, granzyme A, and perforins (Santa-Maria, 
unpublished).
We therefore,  plan to assess the various molecular and immunogenomic markers 
including: circulating tumor DNA, whole exome sequeincing to assess mutational and neoantigen 
burde, T cell receptor sequencing to assess T cell receptor repertoires, and immune-related gene 
expression analysis. 
Response to  next line therapy
We are  adding a third exploratory objective in order to capture response and duration of 
response to next line therapy. This is based on the fact that significant responses have 
been recently documented, after progression when patients are started on next line of

phase), or until progressive  disease (see 4.1.1) or unacceptable toxicity.  The first 750mg 
dose of durvalumab will be 4 weeks after the last combination dose.  Patients may 
continue on therapy after progression or after initial 52 week treatment period as 
specified in Sections 4.1.1 and 4.1.2. Patients will be followed for 3 years or until time of 
death.  Overall response rate (ORR), clinical benefit  rate, PFS,  and OS will be 
determined. In addition, patient’s next line of therapy will be monitored for response rates 
and duration of clinical benefit to next line therapy. 
Patients will  undergo a fresh tissue biopsy prior to study enrollment and two months after 
treatment, unless  deemed to be clinically inappropriate per PI or co-investigator, to 
evaluate  pharmacodynamic  changes in immune-related biomarkers. Correlatives will be 
assessed.
4.1.1 Continuation  of Investigational Therapy after Radiographic Progression 
(Pseudoprogression)
Treatment may be  continued  in the setting of pseudoprogression (radiographic 
increase or new lesions felt to be due to inflammation/immune response) as 
long as all of the following  criteria are met:
Absence of  clinical symptoms or signs indicating clinically 
significant PD. 
No  significant decline in Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group 
(ECOG)  performance status (PS >2 or as deemed by treating 
investigator).
Absence of rapid PD or  threat to vital organs/critical  anatomical sites (e.g.,  
spinal cord compression) requiring urgent alternative medical  intervention
Patients are  made aware of the potential benefits and risks of continuing  study 
therapy in the setting  of Pseudo-Progression. Patients continuing therapy in the 
setting of suspected pseudoprogression should continue with treatment 
according to whether they in the induction phase (durvalumab 1500mg 
intravenously (IV) every 4 weeks for a total of 4 doses,  and tremelimumab 75mg 
IV every 4 weeks for a total of 4 doses) or maintenance phase (durvalumab 
750mg every 2 weeks). For example, a patient with suspected 
pseudoprogression after cycle 2 of durvalumab and tremelimumab would 
continue onto cycle 3 of durvaluamb and trememlimumab rather than 
durvalumab single agent portion of the regimen (maintenance phase).
4.1.2Continuation of Investigational Therapy after 52 Weeks
Patients who  achieve clinical benefit (CR, PR, or SD) until the end of the 52 
week  period may enter a follow up phase or continue durvalumab as shown 
in table 5.1 for up to 52 more weeks as long as they are felt to be deriving 
clinical benefit. 
Patients who enter follow up phase will continue to be monitored.  If during  the 
first 6 months of follow-up,
 patients  developing PD may be re-treated with

4.2.1 Monitoring  of Dose Administration
On infusion  days, patients receiving durvalumab + tremelimumab treatment will be 
monitored during and after infusion of IP as presented in the bulleted list below.  
Supine BP will be measured using a BP recording device with an appropriate cuff 
size, after the patient has rested for at least 5 minutes.  BP and pulse will be 
collected from patients receiving durvalumab + tremelimumab treatment before, 
during, and after each infusion at the following times (based on a 60-minute 
infusion):  
Prior  to the beginning of the infusion (measured once from approximately 
30 minutes before up to 0 minutes [ie, the beginning of the infusion]).  
Approximately  30 minutes during the infusion (halfway through infusion).  
At  the end of the infusion (approximately 60 minutes ±5 minutes).  
A  1-hour observation period is recommended after the first infusion of 
durvalumab and tremelimumab. 
If no  clinically significant infusion reactions are observed during or after the first 
cycle, subsequent infusion observation periods can 
be at the Investigator’s  discretion (suggested 30 minutes after each durvalumab 
and tremelimumab infusion).  
If  the infusion takes longer than 60 minutes, then BP and pulse measurements 
should follow the principles as described above or be taken more frequently if 
clinically indicated.  
The date  and time of collection and measurement will be recorded on the 
appropriate eCRF.  Additional monitoring with assessment of vital signs is at the 
IRB #: STU00200984-MOD0045 Approved by NU IRB for use on or after 10/13/2020 through 5/10/2021.

Version Date:  8.31.2020 – Amendment12 20discretion of  the Investigator per standard clinical practice or as clinically indicated.  
Body weight is also recorded along with vital signs.  A complete physical 
examination will be performed and will include an assessment of the following (as 
clinically indicated): general appearance, respiratory, cardiovascular, abdomen, 
skin, head and neck (including ears, eyes, nose and throat), lymph nodes, thyroid, 
musculo-skeletal (including spine and extremities), genital/rectal, and neurological 
systems and at screening only, height. 
In the  event of a Grade ≤ 2 infusion-related reaction, the infusion rate of 
durvalumab or tremelimumab may be decreased by 50% or interrupted until 
resolution of the event  (up to 4 hours) and re-initiated at 50% of the initial rate 
until completion of the infusion. In subjects  experiencing Grade ≤ 2 infusion-  
related reaction,  subsequent infusions may be administered at 50% of the initial  
rate. Acetaminophen and/or an antihistamine (e.g., diphenhydramine) may be 
administered at the discretion of the investigator. If the infusion-related reaction is 
severe or prolonged (≥Grade 3), methylprednisolone  100 mg (or the equivalent) 
should be administered  as well. Investigators may administer steroids per 
protocol guidelines (see Section 4.3) or at their discretion  as clinically indicated in 
consultation with the study team. 
Appropriate drugs  and medical equipment  to treat acute anaphylactic reactions  
must be immediately available,  and study personnel  must  be trained to recognize  
and treat anaphylaxis.
4.3 Toxicity  Management & Dose Delays/Modifications
Each patient  will be assessed for the development of toxicity according to the timeframe  
referenced in the Schedule  of Events table). Toxicity will be assessed according  to the 
NCI CTCAE  V4.03.
Since the mechanism  of action of both durvalumab and tremelimumab leads to T-cell  
activation and proliferation, immune  related adverse events (irAE) may be observed, and 
be similar to that of other PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitors,  and may include immune-  
mediated pneumonitis,  enterocolitis, dermatitis,  hepatitis, and endocrinopathies (12, 16).
Subjects should  be monitored for signs and symptoms of irAEs.  In the absence  of an 
alternate etiology (i.e. infection or PD), an immune-mediated  etiology  should be 
considered for signs or symptoms of pneumonitis,  enterocolitis, dermatitis,  hepatitis,  and 
endocrinopathy.  In addition to the dose modifications shown in Table 2, it is 
recommended that management of irAEs follow the guidelines outlined for other immune  
checkpoint inhibitors (31). These guidelines recommend the following:
Subjects should be evaluated to identify  any alternative etiology
In the absence of clear alternative  etiology,  all events of an inflammatory nature  
should be considered to be immune-related
Symptomatic and topical therapy should be considered for low-grade events
Systemic corticosteroids should be considered for a persistent low-grade  event  or 
for a severe event
More potent  immunosuppressives  (i.e. infliximab,  mycophenolate mofetil, etc.) 
should be considered  for events not responding to systemic steroids
If the investigator  has any question in regard  to an AE being an irAE, the investigator  
should immediately contact  the principal investigator.  Treatment modifications will not be 
required for AEs that are clearly not attributed to investigational drugs (such as an accident)  
or for laboratory abnormalities that are not deemed to be clinically significant.
Treatment modifications  may be required in the event of treatment-related toxicity.  General  
guidelines regarding treatment modification are provided  in Table 2. Doses may be held 
according to Table 2, there are no dose adjustments. Toxicities  are attributed to 
respective drugs  (durvalumab  or tremelimumab). All toxicities will be graded according 
to NCI CTCAE V4.03  (Appendix B).

General Considerations regarding Immune-Mediated Reactions
Dose Modifications Toxicity Management
Drug administration modifications of study drug/study regimen will be made to 
manage potential immune-related AEs based on severity of treatment-emergent 
toxicities graded per NCI CTCAE v4.03 (unless indicated otherwise).
In addition to the criteria for permanent discontinuation of study drug/study 
regimen based on CTC grade/severity (table below), permanently discontinue 
study drug/study regimen for the following conditions:
 Inability  to reduce corticosteroid to a dose of ≤10 mg of prednisone per 
day (or equivalent) within 12 weeks of the start of the immune-mediated 
adverse event (imAE)
 Grade  3 recurrence of a previously experienced treatment-related imAE 
following resumption of dosing
Grade 1 No dose modification
Grade 2 Hold study drug/study regimen dose until Grade 2 resolution to 
Grade ≤1.
If toxicity worsens, then treat as Grade 3 or Grade 4.
Study drug/study regimen can be resumed once event stabilizes to 
Grade ≤1  after completion of steroid taper.
Patients with endocrinopathies who may require prolonged or 
continued steroid replacement can be retreated with study 
drug/study regimen on the following conditions:
1. The  event stabilizes and is controlled.
2. The patient is clinically stable as per Investigator or treating 
physician’s clinical judgement.
3. Doses  of prednisone are at ≤10  mg/day or equivalent.
Grade 3 Depending on the individual toxicity, study drug/study regimen 
may be permanently discontinued. Please refer to guidelines below.
Grade 4 Permanently discontinue study drug/study regimen.
Note: For asymptomatic amylase or lipase levels of >2.0×ULN, hold study 
drug/study regimen, and if complete work up shows no evidence of pancreatitis, It is recommended that management of immune-mediated adverse events (imAEs) 
follows the guidelines presented in this table:
− It is possible that events with an inflammatory or immune mediated 
mechanism could occur in nearly all organs, some of them not noted 
specifically in these guidelines.
− Whether  specific immune-mediated events (and/or laboratory indicators of 
such events) are noted in these guidelines or not, patients should be 
thoroughly evaluated to rule out any alternative etiology (e.g., disease 
progression, concomitant medications, and infections) to a possible immune-
mediated event. In the absence of a clear alternative etiology, all such events 
should be managed as if they were immune related. General 
recommendations follow.
− Symptomatic  and topical therapy should be considered for low-grade (Grade 
1 or 2, unless otherwise specified) events. 
− For  persistent (>3 to 5 days) low-grade (Grade 2) or severe (Grade ≥3) 
events, promptly start prednisone 1 to 2 mg/kg/day PO or IV equivalent.
− Some events with high likelihood for morbidity and/or mortality – e.g., 
myocarditis, or other similar events even if they are not currently noted in 
the guidelines – should progress rapidly to high dose IV corticosteroids 
(methylprednisolone at 2 to 4 mg/kg/day) even if the event is Grade 2, and if 
clinical suspicion is high and/or there has been clinical confirmation. 
Consider, as necessary, discussing with the study physician, and promptly 
pursue specialist consultation.
− If  symptoms recur or worsen during corticosteroid tapering (28 days of 
taper), increase the corticosteroid dose (prednisone dose [e.g., up to 2 to 
4 mg/kg/day PO or IV equivalent]) until stabilization or improvement of 
symptoms, then resume corticosteroid tapering at a slower rate (>28 days of 
taper).
− More  potent immunosuppressives such as TNF inhibitors (e.g., infliximab; 
also refer to the individual sections of the imAEs for specific type of 
immunosuppressive) should be considered for events not responding to 
systemic steroids. Progression to use of more potent immunosuppressives 
should proceed more rapidly in events with high likelihood for morbidity 
and/or mortality – e.g., myocarditis, or other similar events even if they are 
not currently noted in the guidelines – when these events are not responding 
to systemic steroids.

Note: Study drug/study regimen should be permanently discontinued in Grade 3 
events with high likelihood for morbidity and/or mortality – e.g., myocarditis, or 
other similar events even if they are not currently noted in the guidelines. 
Similarly, consider whether study drug/study regimen should be permanently 
discontinued in Grade 2 events with high likelihood for morbidity and/or mortality 
– e.g., myocarditis, or other similar events even if they are not currently noted in 
the guidelines – when they do not rapidly improve to Grade <1 upon treatment 
with systemic steroids and following full taper
Note: There are some exceptions to permanent discontinuation of study drug for 
Grade 4 events (i.e., hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, Type 1 diabetes mellitus). − With  long-term steroid and other immunosuppressive use, consider need for 
Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP, formerly known as Pneumocystis 
carinii pneumonia) prophylaxis, gastrointestinal protection, and glucose 
monitoring.
− Discontinuation  of study drug/study regimen is not mandated for 
Grade 3/Grade 4 inflammatory reactions attributed to local tumor response 
(e.g., inflammatory reaction at sites of metastatic disease and lymph nodes). 
Continuation of study drug/study regimen in this situation should be based 
upon a benefit-risk analysis for that patient.

Peripheral neuromotor 
syndromes
(such as Guillain-Barre 
and
 myasthenia gravis)Any Grade General Guidance For Any Grade:
− The  prompt diagnosis of immune-mediated peripheral 
neuromotor syndromes is important, since certain patients may 
unpredictably experience acute decompensations that can result 
in substantial morbidity or in the worst case, death. Special care 
should be taken for certain sentinel symptoms that may predict 
a more severe outcome, such as prominent dysphagia, rapidly 
progressive weakness, and signs of respiratory insufficiency or 
autonomic instability.

Version Date:  8.31.2020 – Amendment12 36− Patients  should be evaluated to rule out any alternative etiology 
(e.g., disease progression, infections, metabolic syndromes or 
medications). It should be noted that the diagnosis of immune-
mediated peripheral neuromotor syndromes can be particularly 
challenging in patients with underlying cancer, due to the 
multiple potential confounding effects of cancer (and its 
treatments) throughout the neuraxis. Given the importance of 
prompt and accurate diagnosis, it is essential to have a low 
threshold to obtain a Neurology consult.
− Neurophysiologic diagnostic testing (e.g., electromyogram and 
nerve conduction investigations, and “repetitive stimulation” if 
myasthenia is suspected) are routinely indicated upon suspicion 
of such conditions and may be best facilitated by means of a 
Neurology consultation.
− It is important to consider that the use of steroids as the primary 
treatment of Guillain-Barre is not typically considered 
effective. Patients requiring treatment should be started with IV 
IG and followed by plasmapheresis if not responsive to IV IG.
Grade 1 No dose modifications. For Grade 1:
− Consider, as necessary, discussing with the study physician.
− Care  should be taken to monitor patients for sentinel symptoms 
of a potential decompensation as described above.
− Obtain  a Neurology consult.
Grade 2 Hold study drug/study regimen dose until 
resolution to Grade ≤1.
Permanently discontinue study drug/study 
regimen
 if it does not resolve to Grade ≤1  
within 30 days or if there are signs of 
respiratory insufficiency or autonomic 
instability.For Grade 2:
− Consider, as necessary, discussing with the study physician.
− Care  should be taken to monitor patients for sentinel symptoms 
of a potential decompensation as described above.
− Obtain  a Neurology consult
− Sensory  neuropathy/neuropathic pain may be managed by 
appropriate medications (e.g., gabapentin or duloxetine).
MYASTHENIA GRAVIS:
o Steroids may be successfully used to treat myasthenia 
gravis. It is important to consider that steroid therapy 
(especially with high doses) may result in transient 
worsening of myasthenia and should typically be 
administered in a monitored setting under supervision 
of a consulting neurologist.
o Patients unable to tolerate steroids may be candidates 
for treatment with plasmapheresis or IV IG. Such

o If  myasthenia gravis-like neurotoxicity is present, 
consider starting AChE inhibitor therapy in addition 
to steroids. Such therapy, if successful, can also serve 
to reinforce the diagnosis.
GUILLAIN-BARRE:
o It  is important to consider here that the use of steroids 
as the primary treatment of Guillain-Barre is not 
typically considered effective.
o Patients  requiring treatment should be started with IV 
IG and followed by plasmapheresis if not responsive 
to IV IG.
Grade 3 or 4 For Grade 3:
Hold study drug/study regimen dose until 
resolution to Grade ≤1.
Permanently discontinue study drug/study 
regimen
 if Grade 3 imAE does not resolve 
to Grade ≤1  within 30 days or if there are 
signs of respiratory insufficiency or 
autonomic instability.
For Grade 4:
Permanently discontinue study drug/study 
regimen.For Grade 3 or 4 (severe or  life-threatening events):
− Consider, as necessary, discussing with study physician.
− Recommend hospitalization.
− Monitor  symptoms and obtain Neurology consult.
MYASTHENIA GRAVIS:
o Steroids may be successfully used to treat myasthenia 
gravis. They should typically be administered in a 
monitored setting under supervision of a consulting 
neurologist.
o Patients unable to tolerate steroids may be candidates 
for treatment with plasmapheresis or IV IG.
o If  myasthenia gravis-like neurotoxicity present, 
consider starting AChE inhibitor therapy in addition 
to steroids. Such therapy, if successful, can also serve 
to reinforce the diagnosis.
GUILLAIN-BARRE:
o It  is important to consider here that the use of steroids 
as the primary treatment of Guillain-Barre is not 
typically considered effective.
o Patients  requiring treatment should be started with IV 
IG and followed by plasmapheresis if not responsive

Version Date:  8.31.2020 – Amendment12 38Myocarditis Any Grade General Guidance
Discontinue drug permanently if biopsy-
proven immune-mediated myocarditis.For Any Grade:
− The  prompt diagnosis of immune-mediated myocarditis is 
important, particularly in patients with baseline 
cardiopulmonary disease and reduced cardiac function. 
− Consider, as necessary, discussing with the study physician.
− Monitor  patients for signs and symptoms of myocarditis (new 
onset or worsening chest pain, arrhythmia, shortness of breath, 
peripheral edema). As some symptoms can overlap with lung 
toxicities, simultaneously evaluate for and rule out pulmonary 
toxicity as well as other causes (e.g., pulmonary embolism, 
congestive heart failure, malignant pericardial effusion). A 
Cardiology consultation should be obtained early, with prompt 
assessment of whether and when to complete a cardiac biopsy, 
including any other diagnostic procedures.
− Initial  work-up should include clinical evaluation, BNP, 
cardiac enzymes, ECG, echocardiogram (ECHO), monitoring 
of oxygenation via pulse oximetry (resting and exertion), and 
additional laboratory work-up as indicated. Spiral CT or 
cardiac MRI can complement ECHO to assess wall motion 
abnormalities when needed.
− Patients  should be thoroughly evaluated to rule out any 
alternative etiology (e.g., disease progression, other 
medications, or infections)
Grade 1
(asymptomatic with 
laboratory
 [e.g., BNP] 
or cardiac imaging 
abnormalities)No dose modifications required unless 
clinical 
suspicion is high, in which case 
hold study drug/study regimen dose 
during diagnostic work-up for other 
etiologies. If study drug/study regimen is 
held, resume after complete resolution to 
Grade 0.For Grade 1 (no definitive findings):
- Monitor  and closely follow up in 2 to 4 days for clinical 
symptoms,  BNP, cardiac enzymes, ECG, ECHO, pulse oximetry 
(resting and exertion), and laboratory work-up as clinically 
indicated.
- Consider  using steroids if clinical suspicion is high.

regimen dose until resolution to 
Grade 0. If toxicity rapidly improves to 
Grade 0, then the decision to reinitiate 
study drug/study regimen will be based 
upon treating physician’s clinical 
judgment and after completion of 
steroid taper. If toxicity does not 
rapidly improve, permanently. 
discontinue study drug/study regimen.
If Grade 3-4, permanently discontinue 
study drug/study regimen.For Grade 2-4:
− Monitor  symptoms daily, hospitalize.
− Promptly  start IV methylprednisolone 2 to 4 mg/kg/day or 
equivalent after Cardiology consultation has determined 
whether and when to complete diagnostic procedures including 
a cardiac biopsy.
− Supportive  care (e.g., oxygen).
− If  no improvement within 3 to 5 days despite IV 
methylprednisolone at 2 to 4 mg/kg/day, promptly start 
immunosuppressive therapy such as TNF inhibitors 
(e.g., infliximab at 5 mg/kg every 2 weeks). Caution: It is 
important to rule out sepsis and refer to infliximab label for 
general guidance before using infliximab.
− Once  the patient is improving, gradually taper steroids over 
≥28 days and consider prophylactic antibiotics, antifungals, or 
anti-PJP treatment (refer to current NCCN guidelines for 
treatment of cancer-related infections).a
Myositis/Polymyositis 
(“Poly/myositis”)Any Grade General Guidance For Any Grade:
− Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of poly/myositis. 
Typically, muscle weakness/pain occurs in proximal muscles 
including upper arms, thighs, shoulders, hips, neck and back, 
but rarely affects the extremities including hands and fingers; 
also difficulty breathing and/or trouble swallowing can occur 
and progress rapidly. Increased general feelings of tiredness 
and fatigue may occur, and there can be new-onset falling, 
difficulty getting up from a fall, and trouble climbing stairs, 
standing up from a seated position, and/or reaching up.
− If  poly/myositis is suspected, a Neurology consultation should 
be obtained early, with prompt guidance on diagnostic 
procedures. Myocarditis may co-occur with poly/myositis; 
refer to guidance under Myocarditis. Given breathing 
complications, refer to guidance under Pneumonitis/ILD. 
Given possibility of an existent (but previously unknown) 
autoimmune disorder, consider Rheumatology consultation.

Version Date:  8.31.2020 – Amendment12 40− Consider, as necessary, discussing with the study physician.
− Initial  work-up should include clinical evaluation, creatine 
kinase, aldolase, LDH, BUN/creatinine, erythrocyte 
sedimentation rate or C-reactive protein level, urine myoglobin, 
and additional laboratory work-up as indicated, including a 
number of possible rheumatological/antibody tests (i.e., 
consider whether a rheumatologist consultation is indicated and 
could guide need for rheumatoid factor, antinuclear antibody, 
anti-smooth muscle, antisynthetase [such as anti-Jo-1], and/or 
signal-recognition particle antibodies). Confirmatory testing 
may include electromyography, nerve conduction studies, MRI 
of the muscles, and/or a muscle biopsy. Consider Barium 
swallow for evaluation of dysphagia or dysphonia.
Patients should be thoroughly evaluated to rule out any alternative 
etiology (e.g., disease progression, other medications, or infections).
Grade 1

− Consider, as necessary, discussing with the study physician.
− If  clinical course is rapidly progressive (particularly if 
difficulty breathing and/or trouble swallowing), promptly start 
IV methylprednisolone 2 to 4 mg/kg/day systemic steroids 
along with receiving input from Neurology consultant 
− If  clinical course is not rapidly progressive, start systemic 
steroids (e.g., prednisone 1 to 2 mg/kg/day PO or IV 
equivalent); if no improvement within 3 to 5 days, continue 
additional work up and start treatment with IV 
methylprednisolone 2 to 4 mg/kg/day
− If  after start of IV methylprednisolone at 2 to 4 mg/kg/day 
there is no improvement within 3 to 5 days, consider start of 
immunosuppressive therapy such as TNF inhibitors 
(e.g., infliximab at 5 mg/kg every 2 weeks). Caution: It is

The investigator must  be informed  as soon as possible about any medication taken  from 
the time of screening until the end of the clinical phase  of the study (final  study visit).  Any 
concomitant medication(s), including herbal preparations,  taken during the study will be 
recorded in the appropriate eCRF. Restricted, prohibited, and permitted concomitant 
medications are described in the following tables.  Refer to Table 2 for guidance on 
management of IP-related toxicities.
Prohibited concomitant medications
Prohibited medication/class of  drug: Usage:
Any investigational  anticancer therapy other 
than those under investigation in this studyShould not  be given concomitantly whilst the patient is 
on study treatment
mAbs against  CTLA-4, PD-1, or PD-L1 other 
than those under investigation in this studyShould not  be given concomitantly whilst the patient is 
on study treatment
Any concurrent  chemotherapy, radiotherapy, 
immunotherapy, or biologic or hormonal therapy 
for cancer treatment other than those under 
investigation in this studyShould not  be given concomitantly whilst the patient is 
on study treatment. (Concurrent use of hormones for 
non-cancer-related conditions [eg, insulin for diabetes 
and hormone replacement therapy] is acceptable. 
Local treatment of isolated lesions, excluding target 
lesions, for palliative intent is acceptable [eg, by local 
surgery or radiotherapy])
Immunosuppressive medications  including, but 
not limited to, systemic corticosteroids at doses 
exceeding 10 mg/day of prednisone or 
equivalent, methotrexate, azathioprine, and 
tumor necrosis factor-α  blockersShould not  be given concomitantly, or used for 
premedication prior to the I-O infusions. The following 
are allowed exceptions:
Use  of immunosuppressive medications for 
the management of IP-related AEs, 
short-term  premedication for patients 
receiving combination agent where the 
prescribing information for the agent requires 
the use of steroids for documented 
hypersensitivity reactions
Use  in patients with contrast allergies. 
In  addition, use of inhaled, topical, and 
intranasal corticosteroids is permitted.
A temporary period  of steroids will be allowed if 
clinically indicated and considered to be essential for 
the management of the patient (eg, chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease, radiation, nausea, etc).
Drugs with  laxative properties and herbal or 
natural remedies for constipationShould be  used with caution through to 90 days after 
the last dose of tremelimumab during the study
Sunitinib Should not  be given concomitantly or through 90 days 
after the last dose of tremelimumab (acute renal failure 
has been reported with combination therapy of 
tremelimumab and sunitinib)
EGFR TKIs  Should not  be given concomitantly.
Should be  used with caution in the 90 days post last 
dose of durvalumab.
Increased incidences  of pneumonitis (with third 
generation EGFR TKIs) and increased incidence of 
transaminase increases (with 1st generation EGFR 
TKIs) has been reported when durvalumab has been 
given concomitantly.
Live attenuated  vaccines Should not be  given through 30 days after the last dose

4.5 Other Restrictions During the Study
4.5.1 Birth  control
The following  restrictions apply while the patient is receiving study treatment and for 
the specified times before and after:
Female patient  of child-bearing potential
Females  of childbearing potential who are sexually active with a non-sterilized 
male partner must use at least 1 highly  effective method of contraception 
(Table 1) from the time of screening and must agree to continue using such 
precautions for 180 days after the last dose of durvalumab  + tremelimumab 
combination therapy or 90 days after the last dose of durvalumab monotherapy. 
Non-sterilized male partners of a female patient must use male condom plus 
spermicide throughout this period. Cessation of birth control after this point 
should be discussed with a responsible physician. Not engaging in sexual 
activity for the total duration of the drug treatment and the drug washout period 
is an acceptable practice; however, periodic abstinence, the rhythm method, 
and the withdrawal method are not acceptable methods of birth control. Female 
patients should also refrain from breastfeeding throughout this period.
Male patients with  a female partner of childbearing potential
Non-sterilized males  who are sexually active with a female partner of 
childbearing potential must use a male condom plus spermicide from screening 
through 180 days after receipt of the final dose of durvalumab  + tremelimumab 
combination therapy or 90 days after receipt of the final dose of durvalumab 
monotherapy. Not engaging in sexual activity is an acceptable practice; 
however, occasional abstinence, the rhythm method, and the withdrawal 
method are not acceptable methods of contraception. Male patients should 
refrain from sperm donation throughout this period.
Female  partners (of childbearing potential) of male patients must also use a 
highly effective method of contraception throughout this period (Table 1).  
N.B Females of childbearing  potential are defined as those who are not surgically 
sterile (ie, bilateral tubal ligation, bilateral oophorectomy, or complete hysterectomy) 
or post-menopausal. 
Women will  be considered post-menopausal if they have been amenorrheic for 12 
months without an alternative medical cause. The following age-specific 
requirements apply: 
Women  <50 years of age would be considered post-menopausal if they have 
been amenorrheic for 12 months or more following cessation of exogenous 
hormonal treatments and if they have luteinizing hormone and follicle-
stimulating hormone levels in the post-menopausal range for the institution or 
underwent surgical sterilization (bilateral oophorectomy or hysterectomy). 
Women  ≥50 years of age would be considered post-menopausal if they have 
been amenorrheic for 12 months or more following cessation of all exogenous 
hormonal treatments, had radiation-induced menopause with last menses >1 
year ago, had chemotherapy-induced menopause with last menses >1 year

Highly effective  methods of contraception, defined as one that results in a low failure 
rate (ie, less than 1% per year) when used consistently and correctly are described 
in Table 1 . Note that some contraception methods are not considered highly effective 
(eg. male or female condom with or without spermicide; female cap, diaphragm, or 
sponge with or without spermicide; non-copper containing intrauterine device; 
progestogen-only oral hormonal contraceptive pills where inhibition of ovulation is not 
the primary mode of action [excluding Cerazette/desogestrel which is considered 
highly effective]; and triphasic combined oral contraceptive pills).

4.5.2Blood donation
Subjects should  not donate blood while participating in this study, or for at least 90 
days following the last infusion of durvalumab or tremelimumab.
4.6 Duration  of Therapy
Patients may continue  for  12 months of treatment or until any of the following occur:
Disease progression
Development  of an inter-current illness that prevents further  administration of 
treatment
Unacceptable adverse event(s)
Patient  decides  to withdraw from either study treatment or the as a whole study
The treating investigator determines that the patient should be taken off treatment for 
any reason (i.e. changes in condition,  inability to comply with study treatment or 
procedures)
4.7 Duration  of Follow  Up
After patients come off  treatment they will be followed up at 3, 6, 9, 12 months and then 
every 6 months for 3 years for survival and progression  of disease.
4.8 Removal  of Subjects from Study Treatment and/or Study  as a Whole
Patients can be taken  off the study treatment and/or study as a whole at any time at their 
own request, or they may be withdrawn at the discretion of the investigator for safety,  
behavioral or administrative reasons. The reason(s) for discontinuation  must  be clearly  
documented on the appropriate eCRF . In general, patients who are permanently 
discontinued from receiving investigational product will be followed for disease  
progression, survival,  and safety,  including the collection of any protocol-specified  blood  
specimens, unless consent  is withdrawn or the subject is lost to follow-up  or administered 
subsequent therapy (see below).  Subjects  who decline to return to the site for evaluations 
will be offered  follow-up by phone every 3 months as an alternative.

Version Date:  8.31.2020 – Amendment12 536.0 ENDPOINT  ASSESSMENT
6.1 Definitions
6.1.1Measurable Lesions
Must be accurately  measured in at least  one dimension (greatest  diameter)  with a 
minimum size of 10mm by CT scan (cuts of 5mm or less), MRI,  or physical exam 
(ideally  using calipers). Bone only disease is allowed,  however, must  have an 
osteoblastic  component that can be easily measured.
Note: In  case of skin lesions, patients will have standardized digital photography 
of their disease site for disease assessment.  Photographs will be taken at the 
same time points as the CT scans (as indicated in the study procedures table in 
Section 5).  Frontal and lateral photographs will be taken by study staff on a white 
background (wall or curtain in patient room) using a ruler measurement on a study 
supplied digital camera.  Photographs should not include any identifying 
characteristics.
6.1.2Non-measurable Lesions
Defined as  all other lesions less than 10mm.  Examples of non-measurable lesions  
include leptomeningeal disease, ascities, pleural/pericardial effusions, 
inflammatory  breast disease, lymphangitic involvement  of skin or lung.
6.1.3Response criteria
Complete Response  - Disappearance  of all lesions.
Partial Response  -  At least a 30% decrease in the sum of  the diameters of target  
lesions,  taking  as reference  the baseline sum diameters.
Progressive Disease  -  At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target  
lesions,  taking  as reference  the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline 
sum if that is the smallest  on study).  In addition  to the relative increase of 20%,  the 
sum must  also demonstrate an absolute  increase of at least  5 mm. (Note:  the 
appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered  progression.)
Stable Disease  - Neither  sufficient  shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient 
increase to qualify for PD, taking  as reference the smallest  sum of diameters while 
on study.
6.1.4Immune-related RECIST
In addition  to above,  tumor  response  will be assessed by the irRECIST  for 
investigational  purposes,  not assessment  of primary objective (25). Tumor 
response by irRECIST is defined as an immune-related  PR (irPR) or CR (irCR) 
over a period of at least  4 weeks. We will define  immune-related clinical benefit 
rate as immune-related stable disease (irSD), irPR, or irCR.
6.2 Primary  Endpoint
The primary endpoint  is Overall Response Rate (ORR),  defined  as number (%) of patients 
with one visit response of partial response (PR) or a complete response (CR) in patients with 
metastatic  HER2 negative breast cancer (TNBC in expansion cohort)  treated with 
durvalumab in combination with tremelimumab  using the Response Evaluation Criteria in 
Solid Tumors  (RECIST) Version 1.1 (23). Patients who experience pseudoprogression and 
have subsequent response may count toward ORR. Evaluable patients must have had 
received 2 cycles of therapy and had 2 month scans. 
6.3 Secondary Endpoints
Secondary endpoints  include PFS and OS, where PFS is defined as the time from date 
of treatment initiation until date of documented disease progression or death (by any cause 
IRB #: STU00200984-MOD0045 Approved by NU IRB for use on or after 10/13/2020 through 5/10/2021.
Version Date:  8.31.2020 – Amendment12 54in the  absence of progression),  and OS is defined as the time from date of treatment  
initiation until death due to any cause.
Clinical benefit  rate will be assessed and defined as SD (for ≥ 12 weeks) + PR + CR. Any 
patient who has completed two months of study therapy is evaluable for this end point
The number,  frequency,  and severity of adverse events (as defined by the NCI 
Common Terminology  Criteria for Adverse Events or CTCAE version 4.03) will be 
recorded.  Any patient treated with minimum 1 dose of either study drug will be evaluable for 
toxicity.
6.4 Exploratory  Endpoints
Biomarkers predictive of response  include assessment of serum or tissue-based markers 
including but not limited to: circulating tumor DNA, immunohistochemical expression of PD-
L1; TILs; changes in tissue and peripheral T cell receptor sequencing, mutational and 
neoantigen burden, and immune-related candidate gene signatures at baseline.
To determine  the response rate (RR) and duration of response(DoR) of next line therapy after 
progression on durvalumab/ tremelimumab study regimen, for those patients who are able to 
submit detailed follow up data about subsequent treatment and response. 
7.0 ADVERSE  EVENTS
This study  will be conducted in compliance  with the Data Safety Monitoring Plan (DSMP)  of the 
Robert  H. Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center of Northwestern University  (please refer to 
Appendices for additional  information). The level of risk attributed to this study requires high level 
monitoring, as outlined in the DSMP.  In addition,  the study will abide  by all safety reporting  
regulations,  as set forth in the Code of Federal  Regulations.
7.1 Adverse  Event  Monitoring
Adverse event  data  collection and reporting, which are required as part of every clinical  
trial, are done to ensure  the safety of subjects enrolled in the studies as well as those  who 
will enroll  in future studies using similar agents. Adverse events are reported  in a routine 
manner at scheduled times during a trial (see Section 5 for time points). In addition,  certain  
adverse events must  be reported in an expedited manner to allow for optimal monitoring 
and patient safety and care.
All patients  experiencing an adverse event, regardless of its relationship to study drug,  
will be followed until:
the adverse event resolves or the symptoms or signs that constitute  the adverse  
event  return  to baseline;
any abnormal laboratory  values have returned to baseline;
there is a satisfactory explanation  other than the study drug for the changes  
observed; or
death.
Adverse events  and serious adverse events will be recorded from time of signature of 
informed consent, throughout the treatment period and including the follow-up period (90 
days after the last dose of durvalumab + tremelimumab, or until resolution of AEs.
During the  course of the study all AEs and SAEs should be proactively followed up 
for each subject. Every effort should be made to obtain a resolution for all events, 
even if the events continue after discontinuation/study completion.
If a subject  discontinues from treatment for reasons other than disease progression, and 
therefore continues to have tumor assessments, drug or procedure-related SAEs must be 
captured until the patient is considered to have confirmed PD and will have no further tumor 
assessments.
IRB #: STU00200984-MOD0045 Approved by NU IRB for use on or after 10/13/2020 through 5/10/2021.
Version Date:  8.31.2020 – Amendment12 55The investigator  is responsible for following all SAEs until resolution, until the subject returns 
to baseline status, or until the condition has stabilized with the expectation that it will remain 
chronic, even if this extends beyond study participation.
AstraZeneca/MedImmune retains the  right to request additional information for any subject 
with ongoing AE(s)/SAE(s) at the end of the study, if judged necessary
7.2 Definitions  & Descriptions
7.2.1Adverse Event
The International Conference  on Harmonization (ICH) Guideline for Good Clinical 
Practice (GCP) E6 (R1) defines an adverse event (AE) as any untoward medical 
occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a 
pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship 
with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign 
(including an abnormal  laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally  
associated with the use of an experimental  intervention,  whether or not related to 
the medicinal product.
Recording of  AEs should be done in a concise manner using standard,  acceptable 
medical terms. In general,  AEs are not procedures  or measurements,  but should 
reflect the reason  for the procedure or the diagnosis based on the abnormal 
measurement. 
An AE includes  but is not limited to any clinically significant worsening of a 
subject’s pre-existing condition. An abnormal laboratory finding (including ECG 
finding) that requires an action or intervention by the investigator, or a finding 
judged by the investigator to represent a change beyond the range of normal 
physiologic fluctuation, should be reported as an AE.
Adverse events  may be treatment emergent (ie, occurring after initial receipt of 
investigational product) or nontreatment emergent. A nontreatment-emergent AE is 
any new sign or symptom, disease, or other untoward medical event that begins 
after written informed consent has been obtained but before the subject has 
received investigational product. 
Elective treatment  or surgery or preplanned treatment or surgery (that was 
scheduled prior to the subject being enrolled into the study) for a documented pre-
existing condition, that did not worsen from baseline, is not considered an AE 
(serious or nonserious). An untoward medical event occurring during the 
prescheduled elective procedure or routinely scheduled treatment should be 
recorded as an AE or SAE.
The term AE  is used to include both serious and non-serious AEs.
7.2.2Severity of AEs
All non-hematologic  adverse  events will be graded according to the NCI Common  
Terminology Criteria  for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version  4.03.  The CTCAE 
v4.03 is available at http://ctep.cancer.gov/reporting/ctc.html
If no CTCAE  grading is available, the severity  of an AE is graded as follows:
Mild (grade 1): the event  causes discomfort without disruption of normal  daily 
activities.
Moderate  (grade 2): the event causes discomfort that affects normal  daily 
activities.
Severe (grade 3): the event  makes the patient  unable to perform  normal  daily 
activities or  significantly affects his/her clinical status.
Life-threatening  (grade  4): the patient was at risk of death at the time of the 
event.
Fatal (grade 5): the event  caused death.
IRB #: STU00200984-MOD0045 Approved by NU IRB for use on or after 10/13/2020 through 5/10/2021.
Version Date:  8.31.2020 – Amendment12 567.2.3Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)
All SAEs,  regardless  of attribution,  occurring from time of signed informed  
consent, through 30 days after the last administration  of study drug, must  be 
reported upon discovery or occurrence.
An SAE  is defined  in regulatory terminology as any untoward medical  occurrence  
that:
Results in death.
If death results  from (progression of) the disease, the disease should  be 
reported as event  (SAE) itself.
Is immediately life-threatening.
The patient  was at risk  of death at the time of the event; it does not  refer to an 
event that hypothetically might have caused  death if it were more severe.
Requires in-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing  
hospitalization for ≥ 24 hours.
Results in persistent or significant  disability or incapacity.
Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect.
Is an important medical  event.
Any event  that does not meet the above  criteria, but that in the judgment of 
the investigator jeopardizes  the patient, may be considered for reporting  as a 
serious adverse event. The event  may require medical  or surgical  intervention  
to prevent  one of the outcomes listed in the definition  of “Serious  Adverse 
Event“.
For example:  allergic  bronchospasm requiring intensive  treatment in an 
emergency room or at home; convulsions that may not result  in 
hospitalization;  development of drug abuse or drug dependency.
The causality of SAEs  (their relationship to all study treatment/procedures) will be 
assessed by the investigator(s) and communicated to AstraZeneca.
7.2.4Exceptions to AE  and SAE definitions
Generally speaking,  any adverse event that results in hospitalization or prolonged  
hospitalization should be documented and reported as an SAE,  as described  
above. Likewise, any condition responsible for surgery should be documented as an 
AE if the condition  meets  the criteria for an AE. However, for the purposes of this 
study, neither the condition,  hospitalization, prolonged hospitalization,  nor surgery 
are reported as AEs or SAEs under the following circumstances:
Hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization is for a diagnostic or elective  
surgical procedure for a preexisting  condition. Surgery should  not be 
reported as an outcome of an adverse event if the purpose of the surgery  
was elective or diagnostic and the outcome  was uneventful.
Hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization is required to allow efficacy  
measurement for the study.
Hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization is required for study-directed  
therapy of the target  disease of the study, unless it is a worsening or 
increase in frequency of hospital admissions as judged by the principal  
investigator.
Hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization is due to social reasons (i.e. 
awaiting transport  home).
Pregnancy is not considered a serious adverse event, any patients  who 
become pregnant during the study should discontinue  the study  
immediately. Patients should be instructed  to notify  the investigator if  it is 
determined after completion of the study that they become pregnant  either  
during the treatment  phase of the study or within 30 days or five half-lives  
after the treatment period, whichever is longer.
7.2.5Durvalumab & Tremelimumab Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESI)
IRB #: STU00200984-MOD0045 Approved by NU IRB for use on or after 10/13/2020 through 5/10/2021.
Version Date:  8.31.2020 – Amendment12 57An adverse  event of special interest (AESI) is one of scientific and medical interest 
specific to understanding of the Investigational Product and may require close 
monitoring and rapid communication by the investigator to the sponsor. An AESI may 
be serious or non-serious. The rapid reporting of AESIs allows ongoing surveillance 
of these events in order to characterize and understand them in association with the 
use of this investigational product.
AESIs for  durvalumab ± tremelimumab include but are not limited to events with a 
potential inflammatory or immune-mediated mechanism and which may require more 
frequent monitoring and/or interventions such as steroids, immunosuppressants 
and/or hormone replacement therapy. These AESIs are being closely monitored in 
clinical studies with durvalumab monotherapy and combination therapy. An immune-
mediated adverse event (imAE) is defined as an AESI that is associated with drug 
exposure and is consistent with an immune-mediated mechanism of action and where 
there is no clear alternate etiology. Serologic, immunologic, and histologic (biopsy) 
data, as appropriate, should be used to support an imAE diagnosis. Appropriate 
efforts should be made to rule out neoplastic, infectious, metabolic, toxin, or other 
etiologic causes of the imAE. 
If the Investigator  has any questions in regards to an event being an imAE, the 
Investigator should promptly contact the Study Physician.
AESIs observed  with durvalumab ± tremelimumab include but are not limited to:
Diarrhea/Colitis
Intestinal perforation
Pneumonitis
ALT/AST increases/hepatitis/hepatotoxicity
Neuropathy/neuromuscular  toxicity (eg. Guillain-Barré syndrome, and 
myasthenia gravis)
Myositis/polymyositis
Endocrinopathies  (ie, events of hypophysitis/hypopituitarism, adrenal 
insufficiency, and hyper- and hypothyroidism, Type I diabetes mellitus)
Rash/Dermatitis
Myocarditis
Nephritis
Pancreatitis (or  labs suggestive of pancreatitis - increased serum lipase, 
increased serum amylase) 
Other inflammatory  responses that are rare with a potential immune-mediated 
etiology are also considered as AESIs and include, but are not limited to, 
pericarditis, sarcoidosis, and uveitis and other events involving the eye, skin, 
hematological and rheumatological events. It is possible that events with an 
inflammatory or immune mediated mechanism could occur in nearly all organs.
The following  are more details on specific AESIs:
7.2.5.1Pneumonitis
Across the  durvalumab monotherapy pooled dataset pneumonitis events 
observed (pneumonitis, ILD, acute interstitial pneumonitis and pulmonary 
fibrosis) were reported at a frequency rate of Common (98/1889; 5.2%). 
Adverse events of pneumonitis are also of interest for AstraZeneca,  as 
pneumonitis has been  observed  with anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 mAbs (but 
not with anti-PD-L1 mAbs). Initial  work-up should include  high-resolution CT 
scan, ruling out infection,  and pulse oximetry.  Pulmonary  consultation  is highly 
recommended. Presentations of pneumonitis can range from asymptomatic 
lung infiltrates to those that mimic
severe bacterial  pneumonia [40]. Early consideration of pneumonitis should 
be realised when patients present with new onset or worsening of respiratory 
symptoms such as dyspnea or cough. Prompt treatment with steroids is 
important as per current established toxicity management guidelines. 
Guidelines for the management of patients with immune-related AEs (irAEs) 
including pneumonitis are provided in Table 1.
IRB #: STU00200984-MOD0045 Approved by NU IRB for use on or after 10/13/2020 through 5/10/2021.
Version Date:  8.31.2020 – Amendment12 587.2.5.2Infusion  reactions
AEs of  infusion reactions (also termed infusion-related reactions) are of 
special interest to AstraZeneca and are defined, for the purpose of this 
protocol, as all AEs occurring from the start of IP infusion up to 48 hours after 
the infusion start time.  For all infusion reactions, SAEs should be reported to 
AstraZeneca Patient safety as described in Section 10.3.  
7.2.5.3Hypersensitivity  reactions
Hypersensitivity reactions as well as infusion-related  reactions have been 
reported with anti-PD-L1 and anti-PD-1 therapy (Brahmer et al 2012).  As 
with the administration of any foreign protein and/or other biologic agents, 
reactions following the infusion of mAbs can be caused by various 
mechanisms, including acute anaphylactic (IgE-mediated) and anaphylactoid 
reactions against the mAbs and serum sickness.  Acute allergic reactions 
may occur, may be severe, and may result in death.  Acute allergic reactions 
may include hypotension, dyspnea, cyanosis, respiratory failure, urticaria, 
pruritus, angioedema, hypotonia, arthralgia, bronchospasm, wheeze, cough, 
dizziness, fatigue, headache, hypertension, myalgia, vomiting, and 
unresponsiveness.  Guidelines for the management of patients with 
hypersensitivity (including anaphylactic reaction) and infusion-related 
reactions are provided in Table 1.   
7.2.5.4Hepatic  Function Abnormality
Hepatic function abnormality is defined  as any increase in ALT or AST to 
greater  than 3 × ULN and concurrent increase in bilirubin to greater 
than 2 × ULN.  Examples of hepatitis abnormality are autoimmune hepatitis, 
hepatitis toxic, hepatocellular injury, hepatoxicity resulting in 
hyperbilirubinemia.  Concurrent findings are those  that derive from a single  
blood draw or from separate  blood draws taken within 8 days of each 
other.  Follow-up investigations and inquiries will be initiated promptly by the 
investigational site to determine whether  the findings are reproducible and/or 
whether there is objective evidence that clearly  supports causation  by a 
disease (eg, cholelithiasis  and bile duct obstruction with distended 
gallbladder) or an agent  other than the investigational product. Guidelines for 
management of patients with hepatic function abnormality are provided in 
Table 1.
7.2.5.5Gastrointestinal  disorders
Diarrhea/colitis: is  the most commonly observed treatment emergent SAE 
when tremelimumab is used as monotherapy, but may also be related to 
durvalumab.  In rare cases, colon perforation may occur that requires surgery 
(colectomy) or can lead to a fatal outcome if not properly managed.  There 
were no CTC Grade 4 or 5 events from the pooled dataset, however, fatal 
events of colitis have been reported with durvalumab in combination with 
tremelimumab. Guidelines on management of diarrhea and colitis in patients 
receiving tremelimumab are provided in Table 1.
Intestinal  perforation
Across the  durvalumab monotherapy pool of studies, intestinal 
perforation was reported at a frequency rate of Uncommon (2/1889; 
0.1%); CTCAE Grades 2 and 4. There were no Grade 5
events.
In the durvalumab +  tremelimumab combination pooled dataset, 
intestinal perforation was reported in 3/1088 patients (0.3%; 
Uncommon) and large intestine perforation was reported in
IRB #: STU00200984-MOD0045 Approved by NU IRB for use on or after 10/13/2020 through 5/10/2021.
Version Date:  8.31.2020 – Amendment12 594 patients  (0.4%; Uncommon). All events were CTCAE Grade 4 or 5 
in severity. One patient from study D4190C00010 died due to the 
event of intestinal perforation and had concurrent
peritonitis/Grade 4  sepsis; autopsy was not performed. Another 
patient died due to the event of large intestine perforation and 
disease progression (Study D4190C00006). Both cases were not
considered as  treatment-related by the Investigator.
Monitor for  symptoms that may be related to bowel perforation such 
as sepsis, peritoneal signs, and ileus (refer to the Toxicity 
Management Guidelines for diarrhoea/colitis). Investigators
should adhere  to the overall management for immune-mediated 
toxicities by performing a thorough evaluation to rule out alternative 
aetiologies and by initiating prompt treatment including steroids.
7.2.5.6Endocrine disorders
Immune-mediated endocrinopathies include hypophysitis,  adrenal 
insufficiency, and hyper- and hypothyroidism.  Guidelines for the 
management of patients with immune-mediated endocrine events are 
provided in Table 1.
7.2.5.7Pancreatic  disorders
Immune-mediated pancreatitis  includes autoimmune pancreatitis, and lipase 
and amylase elevation. Pancreatitis is an inflammatory condition of the 
pancreas that typically manifests initially as asymptomatic elevations of 
amylase and lipase in patients treated with immune checkpoint
inhibitors. Across  the 1889 patients in the monotherapy program, events of 
pancreatitis were Uncommon to rare. Four patients (0.2%) experienced 
pancreatitis (CTC Grade 2, Grade 3 and Grade 4 in severity) and 1 patient 
(<0.1%) with CTC Grade 3 acute pancreatitis. Elevations in amylase
and lipase  were reported at a frequency rate of Uncommon (0.6% and 0.5%, 
respectively). In ongoing sponsored studies with durvalumab + 
tremelimumab therapy in 1088 patients, events of pancreatitis were 
Uncommon; pancreatitis was reported in 10 patients (0.9%) with 5 of these
CTC Grade  3 in severity. Elevations in amylase and lipase were reported at a 
frequency of Common (91 patients; 8.4% and 101 patients; 9.3%, 
respectively). Most events of amylase increased were Grades 1 and 2 in 
severity while events of lipase increased tended to be more
severe (Grade  3 and Grade 4) with the combination.
Patients should  be monitored for signs and symptoms of pancreatitis 
including Grade 3 or 4
elevations in  lipase and/or amylase. Close monitoring, early detection and 
prompt treatment of these events are important. 
 Guidelines  for the management of patients with immune-mediated 
pancreatic disorders are provided in Table 1.
7.2.5.8Neurotoxicity
Immune-mediated nervous system  events include encephalitis, peripheral 
motor and sensory neuropathies, Guillain-Barré, and myasthenia gravis.  
Guidelines for the management of patients with immune-mediated neurotoxic 
events are provided in Table 1.
Myositis/polymyositis
In the durvalumab pool of studies  as of the DCO, 3 patients (0.2%) reported 
the event of myositis, including 1 CTCAE Grade 3 in severity. Outside of the 
pooled dataset, there were 2 fatal events of polymyositis considered as 
treatment-related by the Investigator.
IRB #: STU00200984-MOD0045 Approved by NU IRB for use on or after 10/13/2020 through 5/10/2021.
Version Date:  8.31.2020 – Amendment12 60In the durvalumab +  tremelimumab combination pool, Grade 3 myositis event 
were reported in 1 patient (<0.1%). In addition, there were 4 SAEs of 
myositis reported from studies outside of the pooled dataset. Grade 2 
polymyositis was reported in 1 patient (<0.1%) from the
combination pooled  dataset and 2 additional patients (1 each retrieved from 
the global safety database and a study outside of the pooled dataset). The 
severity of these events were Grade 3 and Grade 5 with the latter patient 
having died due to the event of polymyositis which was
considered related  by the Investigator. Autopsy showed polymyositis 
involving the diaphragm and chest wall muscles.
Investigators should  adhere to the Toxicity Management Guidelines by 
performing a thorough evaluation to rule out alternative aetiologies and 
initiating prompt treatment with steroids and modification of study drug dose 
regimen depending on the severity of the event. Refer to the Toxicity 
Management Guidelines.
7.2.5.9 Nephritis
Immune-mediated renal events  include nephritis. Management of patients 
with immune-related nephritis are provided in Table 1.
7.2.5.10 Dermatitis
Immune-mediated rashes can  occur such as dermatitis. Management guidelines 
of immune-related dermatitis are reviewed in Table 1.
Myocarditis
Across the  durvalumab monotherapy pool of studies, as of the DCO of 12 
July 2017 there has been 1 serious report of CTC Grade 3 myocarditis and 2 
additional cases (Grade 3 and Grade 4) outside of the pooled dataset. In all 
cases the patients recovered or were improving with
corticosteroid therapy.
Across the  durvalumab plus tremelimumab combination pool of studies as of 
12 July 2017 there has been 1 report of myocarditis. In addition myocarditis 
has been reported in 4 patients from clinical studies outside of the pooled 
dataset: 3 patients receiving durvalumab plus
tremelimumab (1  of which resulted in a fatal outcome not considered related 
by the Investigator) and 1 patient receiving durvalumab plus tremelimumab in 
combination with cytotoxic chemotherapy agents, etoposide and carboplatin 
(which resulted in a fatal outcome).
Investigators should  be aware of such rare, but severe immune-mediated 
adverse events including myocarditis with its presenting signs/symptoms (eg, 
decreased ejection fraction, arrhythmias, in particular occurrences of 
atrioventricular block).
For patients  with suspected myocarditis, investigators should obtain a 
cardiology consult and
institute full diagnostic work-up  (that includes exclusion of other alternate 
causes such as infection) and the appropriate management that includes 
discontinuing drug (permanently if event progresses to Grade 3 or 4) and the 
prompt use of steroids or other immunsosuppressives.
For rapid  recovery of Grade 1 and 2 events, re-expose with treatment is 
possible. Patients with pre-existing cardiac disorders should be closely 
monitored for deterioration in their cardiac condition, which could suggest 
new onset myocarditis.
7.2.5.11Immune-related adverse events
Based on  the mechanism of action of durvalumab and tremelimumab leading 
to T-cell activation and proliferation, there is a possibility of observing irAEs 
IRB #: STU00200984-MOD0045 Approved by NU IRB for use on or after 10/13/2020 through 5/10/2021.
Version Date:  8.31.2020 – Amendment12 61during the  conduct of this study.  Potential irAEs may be similar to those 
seen with the use of ipilimumab, BMS-936558 (anti-PD-1 mAb), and BMS-
936559 (anti-PD-L1 mAb) and may include immune-mediated enterocolitis, 
dermatitis, hepatitis (hepatotoxicity), pneumonitis, and endocrinopathies 
(Hodi et al 2010, Brahmer et al 2012, Topalian et al 2012). These AEs are 
inflammatory in nature and can affect any organ.  With anti-PD-L1 and anti-
CTLA-4 combination therapy, the occurrence of overlapping or increasing 
cumulative toxicities that include irAEs could potentially occur at higher 
frequencies than with either durvalumab or tremelimumab monotherapy.  
Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of irAEs.  In the 
absence of an alternate etiology (eg, infection or PD), an immune-related 
etiology should be considered for signs or symptoms of enterocolitis, 
dermatitis, pneumonitis, hepatitis, and endocrinopathy.  In addition to the 
dose modification guidelines provided in Table 1, it is recommended that 
irAEs are managed according to the general treatment guidelines outlined for 
ipilimumab (Weber et al 2012). These guidelines recommend the following:
Patients  should be evaluated to identify any alternative etiology.
In  the absence of a clear alternative etiology, all events of an 
inflammatory nature should be considered immune related.
Symptomatic  and topical therapy should be considered for low-grade 
events.
Systemic  corticosteroids should be considered for a persistent low-grade 
event or for a severe event.
More  potent immunosuppressives should be considered for events not 
responding to systemic steroids (eg, infliximab or mycophenolate).
If  the Investigator has any questions in regards to an AE being an irAE, 
the Investigator should immediately contact the treating physician.  
7.2.5.12 Other  rare or less frequent AESIs and immune-mediated adverse 
events
Events with  an inflammatory or immune mediated mechanism could 
occur in nearly all organs.
Inflammatory events  that are less frequent with a potential immune-
mediated aetiology are also considered as AESIs and include, but are 
not limited to, pericarditis, sarcoidosis, uveitis, and other events involving 
the eye (eg, keratitis and optic neuritis), skin (eg, scleroderma and 
vitiligo), haematological (eg, haemolytic anaemia and, immune 
thrombocytopenic purpura) and rheumatological events (polymyalgia 
rheumatic and autoimmune arthritis).
7.2.6Other events requiring  immediate reporting  
7.2.6.1Overdose
An overdose  is defined as a patient  receiving a dose of durvalumab + 
tremelimumab in excess of that specified in the Investigator’s Brochure, 
unless otherwise specified in this protocol.
Any overdose  of a study patient with the durvalumab + tremelimumab, with 
or without  associated AEs/SAEs, is required to be reported within 24 hours 
of knowledge of  the event to the sponsor and AstraZeneca/MedImmune 
Patient Safety or designee using the designated Safety e-mailbox (refer 
section 7.3.3.4).  If the overdose results in an AE, the AE must  also be 
recorded on the AE eCRF. Overdose does not automatically make an 
AE serious, but if the consequences of the overdose are serious, for 
example death or hospitalization,  the event is serious and must  be reported 
as an SAE. There is currently no specific treatment in the event of an 
overdose of durvalumab or tremelimumab. 
IRB #: STU00200984-MOD0045 Approved by NU IRB for use on or after 10/13/2020 through 5/10/2021.
Version Date:  8.31.2020 – Amendment12 627.2.6.2Pregnancy
Maternal exposure
If a patient becomes  pregnant during the course of the study, the IPs should 
be discontinued immediately. 
Pregnancy itself is  not regarded as an AE unless there is a suspicion that the 
IP under study may have interfered with the effectiveness of a contraceptive 
medication.  Congenital abnormalities or birth defects and spontaneous 
miscarriages should be reported and handled as SAEs.  Elective abortions 
without complications should not be handled as AEs.  The outcome of all 
pregnancies (spontaneous miscarriage, elective termination, ectopic 
pregnancy, normal birth, or congenital abnormality) should be followed up 
and documented even if the patient was discontinued from the study.  
If any  pregnancy occurs in the course of the study, then the Investigator or 
other site personnel should inform the appropriate AstraZeneca 
representatives within 1 day, ie, immediately, but no later than 24 hours of 
when he or she becomes aware of it. The designated AstraZeneca 
representative will work with the Investigator to ensure that all relevant 
information is provided to the AstraZeneca Patient Safety data entry site 
within 1 to 5 calendar days for SAEs and within 30 days for all other 
pregnancies. The same timelines apply when outcome information is 
available.(refer section 7.3.3.4).  
Paternal exposure  
Male patients should  refrain from fathering a child or donating sperm during 
the study and for 180 days after the last dose of durvalumab + tremelimumab 
combination therapy or 90 days after the last dose of durvalumab 
monotherapy, whichever is the longer time period.  
Pregnancy of  the patient’s partner is not considered to be an AE.  However, 
the outcome of all pregnancies (spontaneous miscarriage, elective 
termination, ectopic pregnancy, normal birth, or congenital abnormality) 
occurring from 180 days after the last dose of durvalumab + tremelimumab 
combination therapy or 90 days after the last dose of durvalumab 
monotherapy, whichever is the longer time period if possible, be followed up 
and documented.  
Where a  report of pregnancy is received, prior to obtaining information about 
the pregnancy, the Investigator must obtain the consent of the patient’s 
partner.  Therefore, the local study team should adopt the generic ICF 
template in line with local procedures and submit it to the relevant Ethics 
Committees (ECs)/Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) prior to use.  
7.2.6.3Hepatic  Function  Abnor mality
Hy’s Law:  Cases where a patient shows elevations in liver biochemistry may 
require further evaluation and occurrences of AST or ALT ≥3 × ULN together 
with total bilirubin ≥2 × ULN may need to be reported as SAEs. 
Hepatic function abnormality  (as defined in Section 10.1.3.) in a study 
subject, with or without associated clinical manifestations, is required to be 
reported as “hepatic function abnormal” within 24 hours of knowledge of 
the event to the sponsor and AstraZeneca/MedImmune Patient Safety using 
the designated Safety e-mailbox (refer section 7.3.3.4), unless a definitive 
underlying diagnosis for the abnormality (e.g., cholelithiasis or bile duct 
obstruction) that is unrelated to investigational product has been confirmed.
If the  definitive underlying diagnosis for the abnormality has been established 
and is unrelated to investigational product, the decision to continue dosing of 
the study subject will be based on the clinical judgment of the investigator. If 
IRB #: STU00200984-MOD0045 Approved by NU IRB for use on or after 10/13/2020 through 5/10/2021.
Version Date:  8.31.2020 – Amendment12 63no definitive  underlying diagnosis for the abnormality is established, dosing 
of the study subject must be interrupted immediately. Follow-up 
investigations and inquiries must be initiated by the investigational site 
without delay. Each reported event of hepatic function abnormality will be 
followed by the investigator and evaluated by the sponsor and 
AstraZeneca/MedImmune
7.2.8Unanticipated Problems  Involving Risks to Subject or Others
A UPIRSO  is a  type of SAE that includes events that meet ALL of the following  
criteria:
Is unanticipated  in terms of nature,  severity, or frequency
Places the research subject or others at a different  or greater risk of harm
Is deemed to be at least possibly related to participation in the study.
7.3 Adverse Event Reporting
7.3.1Routine  Reporting
All routine  adverse events,  such as those that are expected, or are unlikely or 
definitely not related  to study participation, are to be reported on the appropriate  
eCRF according to the time intervals noted in the appendices. Routine AEs will 
be reviewed by the Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) according to the study’s  
phase and risk level,  as outlined in the DSMP.
7.3.2Determining  if Expedited Reporting is Required
This includes all  events  that occur within 30 days of the last dose of protocol  
treatment. Any event that occurs more than 30 days after the last dose of 
treatment and is attributed (possibly, probably, or definitely) to the agent(s) must  
also be reported accordingly.
1) Identify the type of adverse event  using the NCI CTCAE v 4.03.
2) Grade the adverse event  using  the NCI CTCAE v 4.03.
3) Determine  whether the adverse event  is related to the protocol  therapy.  
Attribution categories  are as follows:
Definite: AE is clearly  related to the study treatment.
Probable:  AE is likely related to the study  treatment.
Possible:  AE may be related to the study treatment.
Unlikely:  AE not likely to be related to the study treatment.
Unrelated: AE is clearly  NOT  related to the study treatment.
4) Determine  the prior experience of the adverse event.
Expected events  are those  that have been previously identified as 
resulting from administration of the agent. An adverse event  is 
considered unexpected,  for expedited reporting purposes only,  when  
either the type of event  or the severity of the event is not listed in:
the current  protocol
the drug package insert
the current Investigator’s Brochure
7.3.3Expedited  Reporting of SAEs/Other  Events
7.3.3.1 Reporting to the Northwestern  University QAM/DMC
All SAEs  must  be reported to the assigned Quality Assurance Monitor  
(QAM) within 24 hours of becoming  aware of the event. Completion of 
the NU CRO SAE Form is required.
The completed form  should assess whether or not the event  qualifies as 
a UPIRSO.  The report should also include:
Protocol description and number(s)
The patient’s identification number
AE (verbatim)
A description of the event, severity,  treatment, and outcome  (if 
known)
The date when the AE started and stopped
IRB #: STU00200984-MOD0045 Approved by NU IRB for use on or after 10/13/2020 through 5/10/2021.
Version Date:  8.31.2020 – Amendment12 64Supportive laboratory  results and diagnostics
The hospital discharge summary (if available/applicable)
All SAEs  will be  reported  to, and reviewed by, the DMC at their next 
meeting.
The following  variables will be collected for SAEs as applicable:
 Date  AE met criteria for serious AE
 Date  Investigator became aware of serious AE
 AE  is serious due to
 Date  of hospitalization
 Date  of discharge
 Probable  cause of death
 Date  of death
 Autopsy  performed
 Description of  AE
 Causality  assessment in relation to Study procedure(s)
 <<Causality  assessment in relation to Additional Study Drug>>
7.3.3.2 Reporting to the Northwestern University IRB
The following  information pertains to the responsibilities of the lead site 
(Northwestern University). Additional participating sites should follow  
their local IRB guidelines for reporting to their local IRBs (if applicable).
Any death  of an NU subject that is unanticipated in nature  and at 
least  possibly  related  to  study participation will be promptly  reported  
to the NU IRB within 24 hours of notification.
Any death of an NU subject while on treatment regardless of 
expectedness or relationship to study drug will be promptly reported  
to the NU IRB within 24 hours of notification.
Any death of a non-NU subject that is unanticipated and at least  
possibly related  and any other  UPIRSOs will be reported to the NU 
IRB within 5 working  days of  notification.
All other  deaths of NU subjects not previously reported, other non- 
NU subject  deaths that were unanticipated and unrelated,  and any 
other SAEs that  were not previously reported as UPIRSOs will be 
reported to  the NU IRB at the time of annual continuing review.
7.3.3.3 Reporting to the FDA (completed by the NU QAM)
The NU QAM will handle all FDA reporting in accordance with the 
following:
The FDA  will be notified within 7 calendar days of any SAE that is 
associated with study treatment, is unexpected, and is fatal or life- 
threatening.
The FDA  will be notified  within 15 calendar days of any SAE that is 
associated with the study treatment, unexpected, and serious but not 
fatal or life-threatening. This includes any previous  SAEs  that were not 
initially deemed reportable, but are later determined  to meet the criteria  
for reporting (i.e. by the DMC).
All other  SAEs will be reported on an annual  basis as part of the annual  
FDA report.
7.3.3.4 Reporting to Medimmune
All deaths that occur during  the study, or within the protocol-defined 30-day 
IRB #: STU00200984-MOD0045 Approved by NU IRB for use on or after 10/13/2020 through 5/10/2021.
Version Date:  8.31.2020 – Amendment12 65post-last  dose of durvalumab + tremelimumab safety follow-up period must be 
reported to AstraZeneca as follows:
Death that  is clearly the result of disease progression should be 
documented but should not be reported as an SAE.
Where  death is not due (or not clearly due) to progression of the disease 
under study, the AE causing the death must be reported to AstraZeneca 
as a SAE within 24 hours (see Section Error! Reference  source not 
found. for further details). The report should contain a comment regarding 
the co-involvement of progression of disease, if appropriate, and should 
assign main and contributory causes of death. 
Deaths with  an unknown cause should always be reported as a SAE.
All SAEs  will be reported, whether or not considered causally related to the 
investigational product, or to the study procedure(s). The reporting period 
for SAEs is the period immediately following the time that written informed 
consent is obtained through 90 days after the last dose of durvalumab + 
tremelimumab or until the initiation of alternative anticancer therapy.  The 
investigator and/or Sponsor are responsible for informing the Ethics 
Committee and/or the Regulatory Authority of the SAE as per local 
requirements.
The investigator  and/or sponsor must inform the FDA (as outlined above), of 
any serious or unexpected adverse events that occur in accordance with the 
reporting obligations of 21 CFR 312.32, and will concurrently forward all 
such reports to AstraZeneca.  A copy of the MedWatch report must be 
faxed to AstraZeneca at the time the event is reported to the FDA. It is the 
responsibility of the sponsor to compile all necessary information and 
ensure that the FDA receives a report according to the FDA reporting 
requirement timelines  and to ensure that these reports are also submitted to 
AstraZeneca at  the same time.
A cover  page should accompany the MedWatch form indicating the 
following:
“Notification from  an Investigator Sponsored Study”
The investigator  IND number assigned by the FDA
The investigator’s  name and address
The trial  name/title and AstraZeneca ISS reference number (ESR-14-
10694 (D4190C00030)
Sponsor must  also indicate, either in the SAE report or the cover page, the 
causality of events in relation to all study medications  and if the SAE is 
related to disease progression, as determined by the principal 
investigator.
Send SAE report  and accompanying cover page by way of email to 
AstraZeneca’s designated mailbox:    
AEMailboxClinicalTrialTCS@astrazeneca.com
If a  non-serious AE becomes serious, this and other relevant follow-up 
information must also be provided to AstraZeneca and the FDA.
Serious adverse events  that do not require expedited reporting to the FDA 
still need to be reported to AstraZeneca preferably using the MedDRA 
coding language for serious adverse events.  This information should be 
reported on a monthly basis and under no circumstance less frequently than 
quarterly.
7.3.3.5 Study recording period and follow-up for adverse events and serious 
adverse events
IRB #: STU00200984-MOD0045 Approved by NU IRB for use on or after 10/13/2020 through 5/10/2021.
Version Date:  8.31.2020 – Amendment12 66Adverse events  and serious adverse events will be recorded from time of 
signature of informed consent, throughout the treatment period and including 
the follow-up period (90 days after the last dose of durvalumab  + 
tremelimumab). 
During the  course of the study all AEs and SAEs should be proactively followed 
up for each subject. Every effort should be made to obtain a resolution for all 
events, even if the events continue after discontinuation/study completion.
If a subject  discontinues from treatment for reasons other than disease 
progression, and therefore continues to have tumor assessments, drug or 
procedure-related SAEs must be captured until the patient is considered to have 
confirmed PD and will have no further tumor assessments.
The investigator  is responsible for following all SAEs until resolution, until 
the subject returns to baseline status, or until the condition has stabilized 
with the expectation that it will remain chronic, even if this extends beyond 
study participation.

durvalumab (MEDI4736) concentration ranging from 1 to 20 mg/mL and delivered 
through an IV administration set with a 0.2- or 0.22-μm in-line filter.  
If a patient’s weight  falls to 30kg or below the patient should receive weight-based 
dosing equivalent to 20 mg/kg of durvalumab Q4W until the weight improves to >30 
kg, at which point the patient should start receiving the fixed dosing of durvalumab 
1500mg Q4W. The appendix includes an example of a weight-based dose 
calculation. (Appendix C).
For 1500mg  durvalumab dose (patients > 30kg), add 30.0 mL of durvalumab 
(MEDI4736) (ie, 1500mg of durvalumab [MEDI4736]) to the IV bag. The IV bag size 
should be selected such that the final concentration is within 1 to 20 mg/mL, and the 
bag is mixed by gentle inversion to ensure homogeneity of the dose in the bag.  
For the 750mg durvalumab maintenance dose, add 15.0 mL of durvalumab 
(MEDI4736) (ie, 750mg of durvalumab [MEDI4736]) to the IV bag. The IV bag 
size should be selected such that the final concentration is within 1 to 20 mg/mL, 
and the bag is mixed by gentle inversion to ensure homogeneity of the dose in the 
bag. Weight based dosing is not required for the 750mg durvalumab dose.
IRB #: STU00200984-MOD0045 Approved by NU IRB for use on or after 10/13/2020 through 5/10/2021.
Version Date:  8.31.2020 – Amendment12 67Patients will be treated  with durvalumab 1500mg intravenously (IV) every 4 weeks 
for a total of 4 doses (along with tremelimumab  75mg IV every 4 weeks for a total 
of 4 doses). After completion of the 4 doses of combination therapy, durvalumab  
will be continued at a dose of 750mg every 2 weeks for up to 18 additional  doses. 
8.1.6Preparation

8.1.10Side effects
Below safety  data from 393 subjects  with various types of cancer who received  
Durvalumab alone is provided.  Related side effects  reported in subjects receiving  
durvalumab alone were:
Frequent -  Expected to occur in 10% to 25% of people  (10 to 25 out of 100 
people):  Fatigue  (13.5%)
IRB #: STU00200984-MOD0045 Approved by NU IRB for use on or after 10/13/2020 through 5/10/2021.
Version Date:  8.31.2020 – Amendment12 68Not Frequent  – Expected to occur in 2% to less than 10% of people (2 to less 
than 10 out of 100 people): Nausea (8.4%), Diarrhea  (5.3%), Decreased appetite
(5.3%), Rash  (5.3%), Vomiting (4.8%), Itchiness  (4.1%), Difficulty breathing
(3.8%), Fever (3.1%),  Low thyroid (2.8%), Increased liver enzymes (2.5%),
Cough (2.5%),  Muscle pain (2.3%),  Stomach pain (2.0%),  Dizziness (2.0%). In 
addition, productive cough,dysphonia, abdominal pain, blood TSH 
increase/decrease, hypophysitis, dysuria, night sweats, pyrexia, oedema peripheral, 
upper respiratory tract infections, pneumonia, oral candidiasis,dental and oral soft 
tissue infections, influenza, myalgia, myositis and polymyositis have been identified 
as adverse drug reactions.
Related  and serious  side effects reported  in subjects receiving durvalumab alone  
were:
•Blockage in the urinary  tract
•Fluid in the space surrounding the lung and inflammation  of the lung
•Increase in calcium in the blood
•Joint  pain
•Worsening  of cancer
•Increase in liver enzymes and blockage  of the tract between the liver and 
small intestine
•Spinal cord swelling
•Irregular heart beat or rhythm
•Chest pain and fluid in the abdomen
•Dehydration
•Disorder in the blood vessels of the organs
•Swelling of the tumor
•Lack of muscle control during walking or picking  up objects
There was one death  felt  to be related to durvalumab  when administered alone.  
The subject who had a prior history of cardiac illness including a prior heart  attack 
died due to a disorder of the blood vessels.  The Study Doctor also indicated 
possible other causes of the fatal event.
8.1.11Nursing  implications
Durvalumab will  be administered as an IV infusion over approximately 1 hour in 
duration (±  5 minutes).  If the infusion is less than 55 minutes or more than 65 it is 
considered a deviation. The IV line will be flushed  with a volume of IV diluent  equal 
to the priming  volume  of the infusion set used after the contents of the IV bag are 
fully administered, or complete the infusion according to institutional policy to 
ensure the full dose is administered and document if the line was not flushed.
Durvalumab infusion  will start approximately 1 hour after the end of tremelimumab 
infusion.  The duration will be approximately 1 hour (± 5 minutes) for each 
infusion.  Refer to Section 4.2.1 for monitoring of vitals.
Since the compatibility  of durvalumab with other IV medications and solutions,  
other than normal saline (0.9% [w/v] sodium chloride for injection) and 5% (w/v) 
dextrose,  is not known,  the durvalumab  solution  should not be infused through 
an IV line in which other  solutions or medications are being administered. No 
incompatibilities between durvalumab and polyvinylchloride or polyolefin IV bags have 
been observed. The date,  start time,  interruption,  and completion time of 
IRB #: STU00200984-MOD0045 Approved by NU IRB for use on or after 10/13/2020 through 5/10/2021.
Version Date:  8.31.2020 – Amendment12 69durvalumab administration  must  be recorded  in the source documents.
In the event that  there are interruptions during infusion, the total allowed time 
should not exceed 8 hours at room temperature. If either preparation time or 
infusion time exceeds the time limits a new dose must be prepared from new 
vials.  Durvalumab (MEDI4736) does not contain preservatives, and any unused 
portion must be discarded.
8.1.12Return  and Retention of Study Drug
All unused  investigational  products will be returned to a MedImmune-authorized  
depot or disposed of upon authorization by MedImmune according to the 
investigational site policy.

A dose  of 75 mg (for patients >30kg in weight) will be administered using an IV bag 
containing 0.9% (w/v) saline or 5% (w/v) dextrose, with a final tremelimumab 
concentration ranging from 0.10 to 10 mg/mL, and delivered through an IV 
administration set with a 0.2- or 0.22-μm in-line filter.  Add 3.8 mL (ie,75 mg of 
tremelimumab, with the dose volume rounded to the nearest tenth mL) to the IV 
bag. The IV bag size should be selected such that the final concentration is within 
0.10 to 10 mg/mL. Mix the bag by gently inverting to ensure homogeneity of the 
dose in the bag.  
If a patient’s weight  falls to 30kg or below the patient should receive weight-based 
dosing equivalent to 1mg/kg tremelimumab Q4W until the weight improves to >30 
kg, at which point the patient should start receiving the fixed dosing of 
tremelimumab 75 mg Q4W. The appendix includes an example of a weight-based 
dose calculation. (Appendix D)
8.2.6Preparation
The dose  of 75 mg of tremelimumab for administration must be prepared by the 
Investigator’s or site’s designated IP manager using aseptic technique.  Total in-use 
storage time from needle puncture of tremelimumab vial to start of administration 
should not exceed 4 hours at room temperature or 24 hours at 2ºC-8°C (36ºF-46°F).

8.2.10Side effects
Below are  safety data from 973 subjects with various types of cancer who 
received tremelimumab alone.  Related side effects reported in subjects  receiving 
tremelimumab alone were:
Very Frequent  – Expected  to occur in more than 25% of people (more than 25 
out of 100 people):  Diarrhea  (41.2%), Rash (27.2%), Itching (25.1%)
Frequent  -  Expected  to occur in 10% to 25% of people (10 to 25 out of 100 
people):  Fatigue  (23.8%), Nausea (21.9%), Vomiting  (13.5%), Decreased
appetite (11.3%)
Not Frequent  – Expected to occur in more than 5% to less than 10% of people  
(more than 5 to less than 10 out of 100 people): Headache (7.2%),  Fever (7.0%),  
Stomach pain (6.7%),  Inflammation of the large  intestine (5.5%)
Related and serious  side effects  reported in  more than 1% of people (more than 1 out 
of 100 people) receiving  tremelimumab  alone were: Diarrhea (9.2%),  Inflammation 
of the large intestine (3.6%),  Vomiting (2.3%), Nausea (1.8%),  Dehydration (1.8%)
Deaths thought  to be related to tremelimumab when given alone were reported in 
approximately 0.5%  of subjects treated (approximately  1 out 200 people). There  
were five deaths reported  that were thought to be related to side effects caused  by 
tremelimumab. The deaths per subject are summarized with the causes noted  
(where known):
IRB #: STU00200984-MOD0045 Approved by NU IRB for use on or after 10/13/2020 through 5/10/2021.
Version Date:  8.31.2020 – Amendment12 71• Sudden death in a subject with advanced skin cancer who had a history  
of smoking. The subject had a family  history of sudden cardiac death  
and had recently  changed antidepressant  medications. While on 
tremelimumab treatment, the subject had symptoms that might be 
consistent with decreased  blood flow to the heart. However,  the exact  
cause of death was not confirmed.
• Lack of oxygen to the brain  due to sudden and unexpected  loss of heart  
function in a subject  whose skin cancer had spread to the lungs. The 
subject had a history of medical conditions that could increase  the risk for 
heart  problems including diabetes, increased blood pressure,  elevated 
levels of fat in the blood and diarrhea. One week before loss of heart  
function, the subject  experienced kidney failure, dehydration, fever  and 
increased creatinine (a compound in the blood removed by the kidney that 
when high can indicate poor kidney function). The study  doctor thought 
there was a possibility that the side effects  and loss of heart  function could 
be related to tremelimumab.
• Imbalance of essential minerals  necessary for body function due to long 
lasting diarrhea in a subject with advanced skin cancer.
• Blood clot in the lungs in a subject with advanced skin cancer that had 
worsened.
• In a subject with advanced skin cancer, respiratory failure in relation  to an 
infection that occurred after complications from surgery performed to treat 
inflammation and bleeding of the large intestine was the immediate  cause 
of death. The study doctor thought  the large intestine  inflammation and 
complications that followed after surgery were related  to tremelimumab.
8.2.11Nursing  implications
The first  day of dosing is considered Day 1. Infusion duration  for tremelimumab  will 
be approximately  1 hour (± 5 minutes).  If the infusion is less than 55 minutes or 
more than 65  it is considered a deviation. Tremelimumab will be administered first; 
followed by Durvalumab  approximately 1 hour after the end of the tremelimumab 
infusion.
Each dose  of investigational  product should be administered using the following  
guidelines:
1. Investigational product must  be administered  at room temperature by 
controlled infusion into a peripheral vein or central line. Prior to the start of 
the infusion,  ensure that the bag contents  are at room  temperature to 
avoid an infusion-related reaction due to the administration of the solution 
at low temperatures.
2. A physician must  be present at the site or immediately  available to respond 
to emergencies during  all administrations  of investigational product.  Fully 
functional resuscitation facilities should be available.  Investigational product  
must not be administered via IV push or bolus  but as a slow IV infusion. 
The entire content of each IV bag will be infused using an infusion  pump.
3. The infusion lines should be attached only at time of use. Lines used for 
infusion during dose administration  will need to be equipped with 0.22- or 
0.2-µm  in-line filters.
4. The duration of the investigational product  administration will be 
recorded.
Tremelimumab will  be administered as an IV infusion over approximately 1 hour 
(± 5 minutes).  The IV line will be flushed with a volume  of IV diluent equal  to the 
priming volume of the infusion set used after the contents  of the IV bag are fully 
administered (unless  prohibited by institutional  practice).

should not exceed 8 hours at room temperature. If either preparation time or 
infusion time exceeds the time limits a new dose must be prepared from new 
vials.
No incompatibilities between  tremelimumab and polyvinylchloride or polyolefin 
have been observed. Tremelimumab solution should not be infused with other 
solutions or medications.
8.2.12Return  and Retention of Study Drug
All unused  investigational  products will be returned to a MedImmune-authorized  
depot or disposed of upon authorization by MedImmune according to the 
investigational site policy.
8.3 Combination  of Durvalumab and Tremelimumab regimens
Patients in  the durvalumab + tremelimumab combination therapy phase will receive 1500 
mg durvalumab via IV infusion q4w for up to 4 doses/cycles and 75 mg tremelimumab via IV 
infusion q4w for up to 4 doses/cycles, and then continue 750 mg durvalumab q2w starting 
on Week 16 for up to 8 months (18 doses) (see Figure 2). Fixed dosing is only for subjects 
with > 30kg body weight.  Patients with a body weight ≤ to 30 kg will be excluded. If a patient 
becomes <30kg on study, please see additional dosing instructions per each agent
Tremelimumab will  be administered first, followed by durvalumab.  The duration for each will 
be approximately 1 hour (± 5 minutes).  A 1-hour observation period is recommended after 
the first infusion of durvalumab and tremelimumab.  If no clinically significant infusion 
reactions are observed during or after the first cycle, subsequent infusion observation 
periods can be at the Investigator’s discretion (suggested 30 minutes after each durvalumab 
and tremelimumab infusion).  
8.3.1 Study  drug preparation durvalumab and tremelimumab
Based on  average body WT of 75 kg, a fixed dose of 750 mg Q2W durvalumab 
(equivalent to 10 mg/kg Q2W), 1500 mg Q4W durvalumab (equivalent to 20 mg/kg 
Q4W) and 75 mg Q4W tremelimumab (equivalent to 1 mg/kg Q4W) is included in the 
current study. 
8.3.2 Monitoring  of dose administration
Patients will  be monitored during and after the infusion with assessment of vital signs 
at the times specified in the Study Protocol.
In the event of  a ≤Grade 2 infusion-related reaction, the infusion rate of study drug 
may be decreased by 50% or interrupted until resolution of the event (up to 4 hours) 
and re-initiated at 50% of the initial rate until completion of the infusion.  For patients 
with a ≤Grade 2 infusion-related reaction, subsequent infusions may be administered 
at 50% of the initial rate.  Acetaminophen and/or an antihistamine (eg, 
diphenhydramine) or equivalent medications per institutional standard may be 
administered at the discretion of the investigator.  If the infusion-related reaction is 
≥Grade 3 or higher in severity, study drug will be discontinued (even during 
durvalumab monotherapy).
As with any antibody,  allergic reactions to dose administration are possible.  
Appropriate drugs and medical equipment to treat acute anaphylactic reactions must 
be immediately available, and study personnel must be trained to recognize and treat 
anaphylaxis.  The study site must have immediate access to emergency resuscitation 
teams and equipment in addition to the ability to admit patients to an intensive care 
unit if necessary
8.3.3 Side Effects when  durvalumab and tremelimumab are given  together (see 
current IB for full details)
Below are  safety data from 61 subjects with lung cancer who received durvalumab  
IRB #: STU00200984-MOD0045 Approved by NU IRB for use on or after 10/13/2020 through 5/10/2021.
Version Date:  8.31.2020 – Amendment12 73in combination  with tremelimumab.  Related side effects  reported in subjects  
receiving the combination were:
Very Frequent  – Expected  to occur in more than 25% of people (more than 25 
out of 100 people): Fatigue (26.2%)
Frequent  –  Expected to occur in 10% to 25% of people  (10 to 25 out of 100 
people):  Diarrhea (21.3%), High level of amylase  (increased amylase  in your 
blood may indicate poor function of your pancreas; 13.1%)
Not Frequent  – Expected to occur in 5% to less than 10% of people (5 to less than 
10 out of 100 people): High level of alanine  aminotransferase (ALT  is a substance 
that is found  in the blood  and when high can indicate damage to the liver;  9.8%), 
Itching (9.8%), Decreased appetite (8.2%), High level of aspartate  
aminotransferase (AST  is a substance that is found in the blood and when  high 
can indicate  damage to the liver;  8.2%), Inflammation of large intestine (8.2%),  
Rash (8.2%),  Low level of blood  thyroid stimulating hormone decreased (this may 
indicate that your thyroid is releasing too much thyroid hormone; 6.6%), High  level 
of lipase (lipase is a substance that is found in the blood and when high can 
indicate damage to the pancreas; 6.6%).  Intestinal perforation has been seen to 
occur in more increased frequency and severity when durvalumab and 
tremelimumab are used in combination.
Related and serious  side effects reported in at least 2 subjects receiving the 
durvalumab and tremelimumab  combination  were: Diarrhea (8.2%),  Inflammation  
of the large intestine (6.6%), Inflammation of the lung (3.3%), High level of AST 
(3.3%), High level of ALT (3.3%),  High level of amylase (3.3%)
Related and serious  side effects reported in at least  2 subjects receiving the 
durvalumab and tremelimumab combination were:
There was one death  thought to be related to the durvalumab and tremelimumab  
combination treatment. The subject experienced myasthenia gravis and 
polymyositis.  Myasthenia gravis and polymyositis are rare conditions that cause  
weakened muscles. They also cause swelling and tenderness. In this subject’s  
case, the muscles responsible for swallowing and breathing as well as other  
muscles were affected. The subject  declined treatment  for the events.  The 
polymyositis led to the subject’s death approximately  2 months after receiving the 
first treatment with durvalumab and tremelimumab.
9.0 CORRELATIVES/SPECIAL  STUDIES
              Please  refer  to laboratory  manual  for additional  details
9.1 Tissue sample collection guidelines 
A fresh  tissue  biopsy  of the primary tumor or a metastatic site at baseline  and after 2 
cycles of treatment will be collected. Re-biopsy  after cycle 2 must  be of the original  biopsy 
site. In case of complete response, a biopsy of the original  site will be re-biopsied, if 
feasible (i.e. chest wall metastasis), or another metastatic site may be used.  The tumor  
lesion planned for biopsy  must  not be used as index  lesion for assessment of disease 
unless there are no other lesions suitable for biopsy or the lesion used for biopsy is ≥ 2 cm 
in its longest diameter. 
Fresh tissue  biopsies will be performed using an image-guided core needle  at the 
aforementioned  time points (pretreatment, after 2 cycles) according to institutional practice. 
If clinically practical,  subjects will undergo  4 core biopsies at each scheduled biopsy time 
point,  ideally at least 3 core biopsies.  Skin punch biopsies are acceptable, however, at least 2 
punch biopsies that are at least 8mm in shortest diameter are necessary. All tissue samples will 
be immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and then stored at -80°C, full details are provided 
in the lab manual. Collected tissues at baseline will undergo a touch prep to be sent to 
pathology for standard of care testing.
IRB #: STU00200984-MOD0045 Approved by NU IRB for use on or after 10/13/2020 through 5/10/2021.

See lab  manual for details.
10.0 STATISTICAL  CONSIDERATIONS
10.1 Study Design/Study Endpoints
This will be  a single-arm, open-label,  pilot phase II study to assess the efficacy and safety  
of durvalumab in combination with tremelimumab in patients with stage  IV breast cancer  
which is HER2  negative. Patients who have completed the week 16 CT or nuclear bone  
scan will be evaluable for response  endpoints. (Note: Bone scans will be done only if the 
patient has bone disease. PET-CT is acceptable in place of bone scan, if a  bone scan is 
contra-indicated for a patient’s disease. The same modality used at baseline  should  be 
used throughout.)
The primary  endpoint is ORR,  defined as number (%) of patients with at least one visit 
response of partial response (PR) plus complete response (CR) in patients with metastatic  
HER2 negative breast  cancer treated with durvalumab in combination with tremelimumab  
using the Response  Evaluation Criteria  in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Version 1.1 (23).Any 
patient who has completed two months of study therapy is evaluable for this end point.
Secondary endpoints  include  PFS and OS, where PFS is defined  as the time from date 
of treatment initiation until date of documented disease progression or death (by any 
cause in the absence of progression),  and OS is defined as the time from date of 
treatment initiation until death due to any cause. Clinical benefit rate (SD for ≥ 12 weeks 
+ PR + CR) will be assessed. Any patient who has completed two months of study 
therapy is evaluable for this end point.
The safety endpoints will be  the number, frequency,  and severity of adverse  events  (as 
defined  by the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse  Events or CTCAE version 
4.03)  will be recorded. Any patient treated with minimum 1 dose of either study drug will 
be evaluable for toxicity. 
The expansion  cohort will follow a similar design but only include patients with metastatic 
TNBC. Responses will be captured by RECIST v1.1.
Exploratory endpoints  include  serum and tissue-based biomarkers including: circulating

Version Date:  8.31.2020 – Amendment12 75therapy after  progression on durvalumab/ tremelimumab study regimen, for those patients 
who are able to submit detailed follow up data about subsequent treatment and response. 
10.2 Sample Size and Accrual
A total  of 35 patients (as needed)with metastatic breast cancer which is HER2 negative will 
be enrolled into this study and receive durvalumab  in combination with tremelimumab, in 
order to get 28 evaluable  for response.  15 patients with ER-positive disease and 15 patients 
with ER-negative disease will be enrolled (i.e. 2 cohorts with 14 evaluable each). Patients who 
have completed  the week 8 CT or nuclear bone scan will be evaluable for response 
endpoints.  Bone scans will be done only if the patient has bone disease. PET-CT is 
acceptable in place of bone scan, if a  bone scan is contra-indicated for a patient’s 
disease. The same modality used at baseline  should be used throughout.
Using a Simon’s  two-stage design, we assume the undesirable overall response rate (null 
hypothesis) to be approximately  10%,  and the alternate hypothesis to be approximately 
30% based  on previously  published and presented data. Eleven patients will be added  in 
the first stage. If 2 or more respond,  then an additional  16 patients  will be added for a total 
of 27. If 6 or more respond,  then the hypothesis that the response rate is at least  30% is 
supported. This design has a Type I error rate of 4% and 80% power,  and has a  70%  
chance of stopping  early for futility after the first stage if the true response rate is 10%.  The 
design  is based on the complete sample  and is not stratified by estrogen  receptor status.
ORR will  also be calculated separately by receptor  status, but the study is not powered 
for analyses within these subgroups.
For the  expansion cohort we expect the ORR based on RECIST v1.1 to exceed 30% 
given our preliminary data.  Using a Bayesian design assuming a prior beta distribution 
with parameters 0.3 and 0.7, there is a posterior probability of 0.81 that the ORR 
exceeds 30% if 8 or more responses out of 20 evaluable patients are observed.
10.3 Data Analyses Plans
The primary analysis  will  be on the intent-to-treat  (ITT) population, including all evaluable  
patients.  Best ORR defined as will be defined as number (%) of patients with at least one visit 
response of complete  or partial response by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid  
Tumors (RECIST 1.1).  Best objective response prior to disease progression will be used.  
The overall response rate will be estimated by the proportion of overall response, and its 
80% confidence interval  (CI) and 95% CI will be estimated using the exact binomial 
distribution.
Additionally,  we will  evaluate clinical benefit rate, defined as stable disease for ≥ 12 
weeks complete or partial  response using RECIST 1.1 guidelines in a similar manner. We 
will also perform similar  analyses using Immune Related RECIST (irRECIST). 
PFS is defined  as the time from date of treatment initiation until date of documented disease 
progression or death (by any cause in the absence of progression).  OS is defined as the 
time from the date of start of treatment until death due to any cause.  For patients alive at 
the time of data cut-off,  PFS and OS will be censored as of the last tumor  assessment 
date or known to be alive,  respectively.  The PFS and OS will be estimated  using the 
Kaplan-Meier method. The number, frequency,  and severity of adverse  events  (as defined 
by the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events or CTCAE  version 4.03) will 
be recorded.
Baseline percent  PDL1 expression, TILs (sTILs,  iTILs,  and their ratio), and changes  in T 
cell subpopulations will be used as a continuous  variable to predict clinical  benefit  or 
overall response rates using appropriate statistical summaries. Cox proportional hazards  
regression will be used to compare how these biomarkers are associated with PFS and 
OS as well.
Changes from  baseline in these biomarkers will also be analyzed to assess for 
pharmacodynamic  effects of treatment.  Continuous variables will be analyzed using 
either paired t-tests,  signed rank tests or repeated measures analysis of variance.

Version Date:  8.31.2020 – Amendment12 76For analysis  of each T cell receptor clonotype, we will apply a newly-developed algorithm  
Bowtie2 aligner (Ref; Nature methods 2012; 9:357-9), in collaboration with Profs. Miyano  
and Yamaguchi  in Human Genome Center,  The University of Tokyo.  We will assign each  
of V, (D), J and C segments in the TCRA and TCRB reference  sequences  provided by 
IMGT/GENE-DB (Ref; Nucleic acids research  2005;  33:D256-61). By our approach, we will 
also identify novel exons that are not deposited in the reference  sequence  database.  After 
decomposition of T cell receptor sequencing reads into V, (D), J and C segments,  we will 
determine amino acid sequences of CDR3 (complementarity determining region  3), which 
plays a critical role in recognition of antigen. We will also calculate the diversity  index 
(inverse Simpson’s index) in CDR3 sequences to assess overall diversity and clonality in 
the T cell receptor clonotyes.  Descriptive  statistics will be used to assess  differences  from 
baseline to two months, and their relationship with clinical endpoints.
Determination of  response rate to subsequent next line therapy will be determined in a 
similar manner as to the primary objective when feasible, where ORR is defined as number 
(%) of patients with at least one visit response of PR or CR. In instances where data for this post-
hoc analysis cannot be obtained and only clinical responses can be obtained (ie patient followed 
up at an outside institution and only clinical radiograph reports are available), these will be 
used. Best objective response prior to disease progression will be used.  Response rates will 
calculated using proportions and the 80% and 95% confidence intervals will be estimated using 
the exact  binomial distribution.  Duration of response to next line therapy will be defined as date 
from next line therapy until date of last dose of next line therapy. The Kaplan-Meier method will be 
used to assess duration of response to next line therapy. 
11.0 STUDY  MANAGEMENT
11.1 Institutional Review  Board  (IRB) Approval  and Consent
It is expected  that the IRB will have the proper representation  and function in accordance  
with federally  mandated  regulations. The IRB should approve the consent form and 
protocol.
In obtaining  and documenting informed consent,  the investigator should comply with the 
applicable regulatory requirement(s),  and should adhere to Good  Clinical Practice (GCP)  
and to ethical  principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
Before recruitment  and enrollment onto this study,  the patient  will be given a full 
explanation of the study and will be given the opportunity to review the consent  form.  
Each consent form must include all the relevant  elements currently  required by the FDA 
Regulations and local or state regulations.  Once this essential information has been  
provided to the patient and the investigator is assured that the patient  understands the 
implications of participating  in the study,  the patient  will be asked to give consent  to 
participate in the study by signing an IRB approved  consent  form.
Prior to a  patient’s participation in the trial, the written informed consent  form should be 
signed and personally dated by the patient  and by the person who conducted the 
informed consent  discussion.
11.2 Amendments
The Principal Investigator  will formally initiate  all amendments to the protocol and/or  
informed consent.  All amendments will be subject to the review and approval of the 
appropriate local,  institutional,  and governmental regulatory  bodies,  as well as by 
MedImmune Scientific Affairs. In the event that external participating sites are added, 
amendments will be distributed by the lead institution  (Northwestern) to all external sites 
upon approval  by the Northwestern University  IRB.
11.3 Registration  Procedures
For potential  patients for phase II studies, study teams are asked to inform the assigned 
QAM (croqualityassurance@northwestern.edu) of the date and time that the patient will

Version Date:  8.31.2020 – Amendment12 79the required  data  will be collected, entered onto the appropriate eCRFs, and submitted  
within the study-specific  timeframes. Periodically,  monitoring visits may be conducted and 
the Principal  Investigator  will provide access to his/her original records to permit  
verification of proper entry of data.  The study may also be subject to routine audits by the 
Clinical Trial Audit  Committee  (CTAC),  as outlined  in the DSMP.
11.9  Publication  Policy
All potential publications  and/or data for potential publications (e.g. manuscripts, 
abstracts, posters, clinicaltrials.gov releases) must be approved in accordance with the 
DSMC Data Release Policies and Processes. The assigned QAM will prepare a 
preliminary data set for DSMC approval no later than 3 months after the study reaches its 
primary completion date, as defined by ClinicalTrials.gov. This is the date that the final 
patient was examined or received an intervention for the purposes of final collection of 
data for the primary outcome, whether the clinical trial concluded according to the pre-
specified protocol or was terminated. If the investigator would like data release to be 
approved by the DSMC prior to when study design specifies, and/or prior to three months 
after a study’s primary completion date, the PI must send a written request for data 
approval to the QAM which includes justification. Requests must be made a minimum of 
six to eight weeks in advance of the expected deadline. The request will be presented to 
the DSMC at their next available meeting. Any DSMC decisions regarding data release 
will be provided to the PI. If the request is approved, the QAM will present the data set to 
the DSMC for approval. A final, DSMC-approved dataset, as applicable, will then be 
released 6-8 weeks after the request was made. The investigators are expected to use 
only DSMC-approved data and statistical analyses any time they are disseminating trial 
data. The investigators must send a copy of the draft abstract/poster/manuscript to the 
study’s biostatistician and assigned QAM to confirm that the DSMC-approved data and 
statistical analyses are used appropriately. Once the biostatistician and QAM gives final 
approval, the publication may be submitted to external publisher.

For durvalumab  dosing done depending on subject weight. Weight-based dosing should be utilized for 
patients whose weight decreased to ≤ 30 kg who would otherwise be receiving the durvalumab 1500mg 
Q4W fixed dose:
1. Cohort  dose: X mg/kg
2. Subject  weight: Y kg
3. Dose for subject:  XY mg = X (mg/kg) × Y (kg)
4. Dose to  be added into infusion bag:
Dose (mL)  = XY mg / 50 (mg/mL)
Where 50  mg/mL is durvalumab nominal concentration.
The corresponding  volume of durvalumab should be rounded to the nearest tenth mL (0.1 mL). Dose 
adjustments for each cycle are only needed for greater than 10% change in weight.
5. The  number of vials required for dose preparation is the next greatest whole number of vials from the 
following formula:
Number of vials  = Dose (mL) / 10.0 (mL/vial)
Example: 
1. Cohort  dose: 20 mg/kg
2. Subject  weight: 30 kg
3. Dose for subject:  600 mg = 20 (mg/kg) × 30 (kg)
4. Dose to  be added into infusion bag:
Dose (mL)  = 600 mg / 50 (mg/mL) = 12.0 mL
5. The  number of vials required for dose preparation:

StatisticsDetails about design, 
sample size and analysisAdded language for 
TNBC expansion cohort 
sating that it will have 
similar design as general 
cohort and responses 
will be captured by 
RECIST 1.1. In addition, 
it states the use of 
Bayesian design for 
analysis. Other language 
modified to align with the 
new updates.
Sample size and accrual 
language modified to 
state: Eleven patients
 will 
be added in the first 
stage. If 2 or more 
respond,  then an 
additional 16 patients 
will be added for a total 
of 27.  If 6 or more 
respond,  then the 
hypothesis that the 
response rate is at least  
30% is supported. This 
design has a Type  I error 
rate of 4% and 80% 
power,  and has a 70% 
chance of stopping  early 
for futility after the first 
stage if the true 
response rate is 10%.In order  to 
accommodate and 
analyze the expansion 
cohort of TNBC 
patients

Background:
Immune Checkpoint  
Blockade in Breast  
CancerPrevious language  
regarding immune 
checkpoint blockadeUpdated with  current 
developments in 
immune checkpoint 
blockade in breast 
cancer.
This language  serves as 
rationale for modification 
to the eligibility criteria 
which now facilitates the 
enrollment of PD-L1 
negative patients in the 
front line setting only 
into the trial. It has been 
clarified that beyond 
frontline, any PD-L1 
status is acceptable. this 
will give the study some 
wriggle room for 
enrollmentUpdates made  based 
on evolving clinical 
landscape. Reference 
provided.
Section 3.1.1
Inclusion criteria
and Study summaryCriteria stated 
requirements
 for both 
general and expansion 
cohort. 
Expansion cohort 
included.
 
The expansion  cohort 
will only include HER2-
negative, ER and PR-
negative patients.The general cohort 
details are now included 
as a note. The 
Expansion cohort will 
now enroll only 
metastatic
 TNBC 
patients.Enrollment to  general 
cohort is done. Only 
expansion cohort is 
now enrolling patients.
TNBC patients  alone 
are being enrolled. 
Rationale explained in 
section 1.7.3

Inclusion criteria
and Study summaryAlong with  other 
requirements, patients 
with ER positive 
disease were included.Patients with ER positive 
disease removed and  
PD-L1 negative patients 
in the front line setting 
are now eligible. A note 
has been inserted to 
clarify that beyond 
frontline, any PD-L1 
status is acceptableBased on  current

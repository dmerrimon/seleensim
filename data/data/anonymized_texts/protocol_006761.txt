PURPOSE 1.1 Name and Intended Use  
The device used in this study is called TempSure®.  
 The intended use of the TempSure® device is to us e the Firm handpieces for non-invasive lipolysis. 
 
1.1 Objectives   
1. Primary Objectives:  
 To demonstrate adipocyte injury confirmed by histology. 
2. Additional Assessment:  
 Ultrasound measurements. (optional) 
 Evaluation of thermal imaging taken of the treatment during device use. (optional) 
 Safety assessment through the collection of Adverse Events. 
 
 1.2 Duration of the Investigation 
The sponsor anticipates that all subjects can be enrolled within 3 months. If subject participates in all visits, then the subject’s participation in this study may last up to 2 months . It is anticipated that it will take approximately 3 months 
to analyze the data collected during this study. The total duration of this study is anticipated to last approximately 8 
months.   
 
2.0 PROTOCOL 
2.1 Protocol Methodology and Analysis  
Methodology: 
Subjects are to be enrolled in this clinical study if they are 18 – 55 years old and are willing to have biopsies taken 
from a control site and the treatment ar ea. Subjects may be enrolled if they have been previously scheduled or are 
willing to have an abdominoplasty procedure at one of th e study specified timepoints, after being treated with the 
study device . A maximum of 12 subjects will be enrolle d at up to 3 study centers. Subjects will attend a 
screening/pretreatment visit which may be  performed on the same day as the tr eatment visit.  Subjects may receive 1 
treatment with the Temp Sure® Firm on the abdomen. Su bjects may receive a phone call 1 week (1-10 days) post each 
treatment. Subjects will undergo abdominoplasty surgery at one of four predetermined timepoints after an abdomen 
treatment with TempSure® Firm: day 0 (within 24 hours after treatment), 10 days (+/- 3 days), 20 days (+/-  3 days) , or  30 days (+/- 7 days). This will be determined on availability of the subject and/or on an as needed basis and this 
will be decided by the investigator and Sponsor. An unscheduled visit or phone call may be performed at any time 
during the study at the subject’s request or as  deemed necessary by the site Investigator. 
 
Analysis: 
Upcoming generations are proving to have an interest in  non-ablative aesthetic treatments and will drive demand for 
innovated products, procedures, and practice design.
i Due to this shift in patient base, practices need to evolve to adapt 
to the newer generational ideologies. There have been rapid advances in RF technology over the past few years and the 
nonsurgical treatment using this energy source offers great promise to our aging population.ii Radiofrequency 
technology for lipolysis needs to be further investigated to optimize treatment parameters for safe and effective non-
ablative aesthetic treatments.
 
Relevance: 
Non-invasive fat reduction is a commonly sought out procedure and continues to increase in demand (+3% from 2018 to 2019)
3 perhaps because, according to the CDC, the preval ence of obesity in the U.S.  was 42.4% in 2017-20184.  
Currently, the treatments availa ble for non-invasive lipolysis include, but not limited to, radiofrequency, cryolipolysis, 
laser lipolysis, HIFEM, and ultrasound. Th e limitations of current products on the market include different side effect 
profiles and modes of administration. 
 
Testability: The truSculpt device has been  cleared for used using the 2 MHz settin g for the 40cm² handpiece for reduction in 
circumference of the abdomen and non-invasive lipolysis of the abdomen (FDA K180709). The truSculpt study

utilized the collection of biopsies and safety data. This study will utilize the histology data from multiple   biopsies collected at specified timepoints and safety data to  evaluate the safety and efficacy of the treatment. 
  
Compatibility: Due to such a high prevalence of obesity in the U.S. and the increasing demand for non-invasive lipolysis treatments, 
there is a need to treat unwanted fat in its earlier stages to optimize treatment outcomes. As  a subject gets older or the 
condition worsens,  treatments ma y need to be more aggressive to get the same response as younger subjects or less 
severe cases.  
 
Predictive power: While this study will ob serve lipolysis effects of  tr eatments with TempSure® handpi eces on the abdo men, results 
could potentially be applied to a variety of body areas..  
 
2.2 Protocol Study Design 
This is a prospective, open-labeled, non -randomized, multi-cente r clinical study to collect safety and efficacy data on 
the TempSure® Firm.

 Allergy to corn, such as the corn derivative ingredient in Parker Aquasonic Gel. 
 If the subject has an unhealthy expectation of the results  – treatment with the TempSure device is not plastic 
surgery; all subjects should be fully informed of the  expected treatment results.  
 Nerve insensitivity to heat in the treatment area.  
 Severe laxity or sagging that causes redundant folds of tissue or hanging skin in the area to be treated – this 
treatment will be ineffective. 
 Accutane (Isotretinoin) use six to twelve months prior to treatment, as this can thin the skin and make it 
brittle. 
 Studies of the use of the RF generator on subjects that have any of the following conditions is unknown: 
o Autoimmune Disease 
o Diabetes  
o Herpes Simplex 
 Use caution when treating areas that have scars,  tattoos, permanent makeup, and permanent brows. 
 
List any concomitant medications or procedures permitted before, during and after the trial.  
 
Subjects will be recruited for the study through investig ator’s existing patient databases and advertisements. 
 
Subject populations will not be eligible to participate in the study if they are vulnerable populations such as children, 
pregnant women, prisoners, institutiona lized individuals, and any persons requiring a legally authorized representative 
as part of the consenting process. 
 
Subject population characteristics that will not be eligible to participate in the study include non-English speaking 
individuals and people who cannot read or comprehend English.  
 
2.4 Screening  
Subjects will be asked questions about their medical history,  inclusion/exclusion criteria will be verified, and a limited 
physical exam may be performed.  If applicable, discontinuation of concomitant medications will be discussed with 
subject. Pre and post treatment instructions will be reviewed with the subject. Subjects will be informed of standard COVID-19 procedures that adhere to federal and state guidelines. 
 
Procedure for the Lim ited Physical Exam: 
If the investigator determines a limited physical exam is nece ssary, the exam will be similar to a basic annual physical 
exam performed by a qualified clinician to determine ge neral overall health. The limited medical exam may include 
any or all of the following; vital signs such as blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate and body temperature, general appearance, listening to the heart, lungs and abdomen w ith a stethoscope, head and neck exam, in addition to 
examining the throat, tonsils, teeth, ears, eyes and nose as well as a neurological exam such as testing muscle strength, 
reflexes, balance and mental state. 
 
The following pre-treatment instructions will be reviewed: 
o Shave any dense hair on the area to be treated.  
o Do not wear constrictive clothing. Treatment area must be accessible. The back for the neutral pad will also 
need to be accessed.    
o Treatment and control areas must be free of any cuts, scratches, open lesions or infection.  
o For optimum treatment, hydrate by drinking water (at leas t 8 cups daily) or hydrating fluids such as Gatorade. 
Avoid drinking alcohol for 24 hours in advance. 
 The following post treatment instructions will be reviewed:  
o If the skin is slightly pink or red in areas following the treatment, avoid hot water when washing or showering 
until any erythema (redness) has subsided.  
o Soothing creams or moisturizers, such as Aveeno, may be used.  
o Gently massage the treated area daily for 5 minutes for the duration of your involvement in the study. 
o Use a sun block with UVA and UVB protection with SPF of 30 or greater to prevent sun damage.

  2.5 Informed Co nsent Process and Enrollment 
Subjects will be asked to review the pre and post treatment in structions prior to signing the informed consent form and 
prior to involvement in the study.  Subjects who sign the in formed consent will be screened to confirm eligibility and, 
if eligible, will be assigned a subject identification nu mber. Subjects will be de-identified through their subject 
identification number, which will be stored in a secure lo cation.  Subject identification numbers will be generated 
chronologically and assigned only to subjects who have met all the study selection criteria and have signed the informed consent form.  Informed consent will be obtain ed prior to a subject’s involvement in study related 
procedures.  A subject will be considered enrolled in the study once they have signed the informed consent form.  
 
2.6 Pre-Treatment Procedures 
If the subject is of childbearing potential (i.e., females not post-menopausal or not surgically sterile), they will be 
asked if they are pregnant and date of  last menstrual cycle. Prior to treatment, a urine pregnancy test will be 
performed on all women of childbearing potential. A urine pregnancy test may also be conducted at the Investigator’s 
discretion at any time during the study. If a urine pregnancy test is conducted,  a negative result must be obtained within 24 hours prior to the treatment. 
 
Urine Pregnancy Test Procedure: 
o A urine sample is tested mid-stream or by cup sample with an indicator stick.  
o Negative results are indicated on the indicator stick.  
 
 The area to be treated will be identified an d may be marked with a surgical marker. 
 Photographs will be taken prior to and after th e treatment(s). 
 An ultrasound will be performed prior to the treatment.  
 The treatment area and the neutral pad area may be cleansed with water and soap and/or  alcohol. 
 The neutral pad will be placed on the back in an area determined by the Investigator to optimize and maintain  
device energy settings  during the treatment.

2.14 Evaluation Methods 
Photographs: 
Photographs may be taken at all visits and will be used to assess safety of treatment. 
 Histology of Biopsy 
Biopsies of the excised tissue will be obtained and prepared for histology to examine the tissue response following RF 
treatment. Each specimen will first be preserved with a fixative and stained with Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E stain).  Samples will be assessed independently and may be assessed for normal structures, cell viability, vascular injury, and 
overall morphologic traits, injury, and any indications of the healing response. A report will be provided to summarize 
finding for all samples.   
Ultrasound (U/S) 
An ultrasound scan is a noninvasive diagnostic test that us es sound waves to capture live in ternal anatomical images of 
the body. Subjects will  be lying down on a table with a secti on of the body exposed for the test.  A special lubricating 
gel will be applied to the skin. This prevents friction be tween the ultrasound transducer —similar in appearance to a 
microphone— and the sk in. The lubricating gel also helps transmit the sound waves during the scan. After the 
ultrasound e is performed, the gel will be cleaned off the subject with water. The ultrasound typically lasts less than 30 
minutes.  
 
Treatment Discomfort/Pain Evaluation: 
Subjects will be asked to report the general level of treatm ent discomfort on a scale of 0 (none) to 10 (maximum 
intolerable pain) using the universal pain assessment tool (Appendix B) 
 
Temperature Monitoring An infrared thermometer may also be used for temperature monitoring to measure temper ature on the skin before, 
during, and after a treatment. 
 
2.15 Adverse Event Recording 
All data captured must be supported by the Investigator’s timely assessment and documentation of the adverse event in 
the case report forms or source documents.  All document ed adverse events will be reviewed by the Sponsor or 
designee to determine whether the advers e event meets regulatory reporting requir ements and to ensure timely adverse 
event reporting in compliance with local and global regulatory requirements.  
 
Adverse Events Pertaining to the TempSure® Device: 
Mild discomfort during treatment may be experienced by the subject. Typically, the discomfort is temporary and localized within the treatment area. Mild edema (swelling)  and erythema (redness) may occur. Initial studies indicate 
that these side effects typically resolve within 2 to 24 hours. 
 Other anticipated side effects may include pain, skin burns, blistering, bleeding, scarring, crusting, bruising, infection, 
itching, prolonged edema (swelling) and erythema (redness), ha rdness, and nodules. Loss of hair pigment may also occur 
within and adjacent to  the treatment area. 
 
Adverse Events Pertaining  to Ultrasound Gel: 
The gel is a water-based gel that may be placed on the sk in during the TempSure® Firm  treatment. No known adverse 
events are documented. However, an allerg ic reaction is always possible when placi ng a topical gel on the skin. Allergic 
reaction may include a mild reaction such as skin redness, irr itation, or hives, all are typically transient and fully resolve.  
 Adverse Events Pertaini ng to Neutral Pad: 
Subject may feel mild heat or hot spots during the treatment(s).  If the subject reports heat at the pad site, evaluate the 
site, check for epidermal injury. Skins burns may occur if subject  does not report feeling excessive heat at the site of the 
pad.  
 
 Adverse Events Pertai ning to Ultrasound: 
Ultrasound imaging has minimal risks and may produce effects on the body such as redness and pockets of gas.  Skin 
rashes from use of the ultrasound gel may also occur.

 Adverse Events Pertaining to the Surgical Marker: 
Using surgical marker has minimal risks and may produce effects on the body such as redness or a rash. Markings may 
remain visible for a few days or may be removed with mild soap or alcohol. 
 
Other Cautions: 
Incomplete response or no response may occur since some subjects may not respond to treatment.  
 
2.16 Statistical Analysis  
 
2.16.1 Hypothesis 
For this study to be consider ed a success, biopsies from th e from the treatment areas sh ow adipocyte injury and/or 
inflammatory immune cell response to the subcutaneous fat. 
 
2.16.2 Sample Size Rationale Based on the need for repetition of results and comparison to  predicate devices, it was determined that a total of 12 
subjects will be required for this study. 
  2.16.3 Patient Populations 
Interim results may be collected and reported.  All data will be analyzed at the end of the study.  The primary analysis 
will be performed by the intention-to-treat approach.  Everyo ne who begins the treatment is part of the study whether 
he or she completes the study or not.  Additional per-protocol analysis may also be performed on subjects who 
complete the entire clinical trial according to the pr otocol.  The most a ppropriate method of handling missing values 
will be chosen based on the trial’s goals, endpoints and context.  
The analysis of demographic, medical hi story, and efficac y variables will be based on a ll patients who receive at least 
one treatment and biopsies. Th e analysis of safety data will be based on all patients who  receive at least one 
treatment. .  
  
2.16.4 Analysis of Demographic and Medical History Variables Summaries will be prepared for all im portant demographic and medical history variables. For quantitative variables 
summaries will include the sample size, mean, median, st andard deviation, minimum, and maximum.  For these 
variables the treatment groups will be compared using either a t-test or a Wilcoxon Rank Sum test, as appropriate.  For 
categorical variables the summaries w ill include the sample size and the numb er and percent of  patients for each 
outcome.  For these variables, the treatment groups will be co mpared using Fisher’s Exact te st.  Statistical significance 
will be declared if the two-sided p-value is < 0.05.  
  
2.16.5 Analysis of  Efficacy Variables 
Analysis of histological results will use biopsies from the control areas with normal skin subcutaneous adipose tissue 
structures and no indication of changes to be compared against the biopsies from the from the treatment areas.  
 
2.16.6 Analysis of Safety Variables 
Safety will be assessed through the degree of pain/discomfor t related to the procedure (universal pain scale) and the 
collection of Adverse Events throughout the course of th e study. For each treatment group these variables will be 
summarized. Ultrasound measurements and temperature mo nitoring are optional assessments and will be used for 
safety purposes only. The summaries will include the number and percent of patients for each outcome.  No statistical 
comparisons will be performed for any of these variables. 
 
 
3.0  RISK ANALYSIS AND MANAGEMENT  
3.1 Risk Determination 
 This device used in this study  does not meet the FDA definition for a Significant Risk Device study per 21 CFR 
812.3(m).  Therefore, the Sponsor determines this is a non-significant risk device study. 
 
PROTOCOL #: 7027-MCPL-2021    
________________________________________________________________________________ 
 
__________________________________________________________________________________________ 
 
Version 1.0 March 5, 2021  CONFIDENTIAL Page 16 of 27  
Significant risk device means an investigational device that: (1) Is intended as an implant and presents a potential for se rious risk to the health, safe ty, or welfare of a subject; 
(2) Is purported or represented to be for a use in supporting or sustaining human life and presents a potential for 
serious risk to the health, sa fety, or welfare of a subject; 
(3) Is for a use of substantial importance in diagnosing, curi ng, mitigating, or treating dise ase, or otherwise preventing 
impairment of human health and presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject; or 
(4) Otherwise presents a potential for serious risk  to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject. 
 
3.2 Risk Management  
The Investigators in this clinical trial have been invited to participate based on his/her previous experience with the use 
of the system and/or similar systems and industry experience.  Experience with treatments is the most critical element 
for managing subject risk in this trial. 
 
In addition, as with any study, there is a risk of bias. To minimize/avoid bias, objective evaluation methods (e.g. 
histology) will  be used in conjunction with subjective evaluation methods.. The value of the compensation to the clinical investigator for conducting the study is not influenced by th e study outcome.  If photogra phic results are listed as the 
primary objective, they are to be eval uated by blinded evaluators who did not partake in the study. If information 
concerning investigator assessment of improvement or inves tigator satisfaction is collected , then it is not listed as an 
objective for the study. 
 
All other known risks will be disclosed to the subject via the informed consent process. Since this is an elective 
procedure and subjects are volunteers, it can be assumed that  signing the informed consent form is indicative of 
agreement to accept the risks involved. 
 Risks to subjects who participate in the study are the sa me as those for subjects undergoing similar noninvasive 
lipolysis treatment(s). It is possible to have an adverse reaction to treatment with the TempSure device .  There may 
also be some unknown side effects.  
3.3 Risk Analysis 
CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSED INVESTIGATION: 
Radiofrequency (RF) technology is commonly used in surgery, non-invasive treatments and aesthetic applications. RF 
technology is a safe method for non-ablative (a non-wounding device treatment which heats underlying skin) 
treatment, because energy can be precisely delivered thr ough the skin to the subcutaneous adipose tissue beneath 
without damaging the epidermis.v  
 According to published data, the elevation of tissue temperatur e between 42°C to 47°C can affect the cellular matrix of 
the adipose tissue creating injury to the adipoc ytes and prompt an inflammatory response.
vi Gradually, the treated 
adipocytes will be removed by the human body through th e inflammatory clearing proce ss which may take weeks to 
months. The regeneration of adipose tissue is very slow (ove r years) and the total volume of the fat in treatment area 
will decrease due to the loss of adipocytes. 
 ASSESSMENT OF RISKS OF THE PROPOSED INVESTIGATION: 
There are two risks identified with the TempSure® device used in this study. The first risk identified is the lack of 
clinical data providing evidence of eff ectiveness of Firm handpieces for the treat ment of lipolysis. Parameters need to 
be further investigated to be optimized for efficacious results. The second risk id entified is the safety of treatment with 
the TempSure® Firm handpieces . Since the TempSure® Firm handpieces have  not been cleared for use for lipolysis 
and has limited safety data for this indication, optimizing the safety profile is necessary. 
 
The risk identified with the overall clinical in vestigation is the integrity of data collected. 
 There are multiple clinical mitigation strategies for the risks identified. Proper training on the device and protocol will 
be performed. Data from prior investigations will be utilized to minimize side effects and optimize treatment 
outcomes. Monitoring of the study will be implemented to minimize subject and data risks.

The subject may or may not have a reduction in unwanted fat.  
CONSIDERATION OF PATIENT PREFERENCE INFORMATION: 
Many physicians support the use of radiofrequency devices for non-invasive cosmetic treatments based on current patient satisfaction. s with approved radiofrequency device s. However, there is still a level of interest in novel 
technologies that effectively reduce fat, potentially elimina ting  the need for invasive treatments for fat reduction.  
 ASSESSMENT OF UNCERTAINTY: 
There is uncertainty of efficacy of tr eatment when TempSure® Firm is used for the treatment of unwanted fat.  
 
CONCLUSION: 
The TempSure® Firm handpieces used in this study have not been FDA cleared for use for the treatment of wanted fat 
(lipolysis) but pose no more risk than the currently cleared indications for use.  
  
A previous safety study, CYN18-RF-TISSUE-RD, was conducted using excised human abdominoplasty tissue to test various radiofrequency parameters with the 60mm handpiece. Additional safety studies, CYN19-TS-ABDOM and 
CYN20-FIRM-HISTO, were conducted using patients scheduled for an abdominoplasty surgery to use in-vivo tissue 
to test various radiofrequency parame ters with the 60mm handpiece. CYN19- TS-ABDOM used thermal measurements 
of treatment zones were collected to evaluate the depth of penetration and effects on human tissue. CYN20-FIRM-
HISTO use biopsies to analyze histological response.  
 Studies CYN17-RF-CLINIC and CYN19-TS -ENVI-ABD collected safety and ef ficacy data using the 25mm, 30mm, 
and 60mm handpieces on various body area s, including the abdomen and flanks.   
 Patient population to be enrolled in this clinical study:  
Total anticipated population: 12 Subjects  
Age Range years old: 18 – 55 years old  
Gender: Male or Female 
Condition: Unwanted fat on abdomen and scheduled for abdominoplasty surgery

The Investigator and/or designated study staff will review  each event and assess its relationship to the study device 
(not related, unlikely, possible, probable, and highly pr obable). The following definitions will be used for rating 
relationship to the TempSure® Firm treatments:  
 Not related – The event is clearly related to other fact ors such as the subject’s c linical state, therapeutic 
interventions, or concomitant medications administered to the subject. 
 Unlikely – The event was most likely produced by other fact ors such as the subject’s clinical state, therapeutic 
interventions, or a concomitant medication administered to the subject; and does not follow a known response 
pattern to the investigational product. 
 Possible – The event follows  a reasonable temporal sequence from the time of investigational product 
administration; and/or  follows a known response pattern to the study sampling sessions; but could have been 
produced by other factors such as the subject’s clinical state, therapeutic interventions, or concomitant 
medications administer ed to the subject. 
 Probable – The event follows a r easonable temporal sequence from th e time of investigational product 
administration; and follows a known response pattern to the investigational product; and cannot be reasonably 
explained by other factors such as the subject’s clin ical state, therapeutic interventions, or concomitant 
medications administer ed to the subject. 
 Highly Probable – The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the time of investigational product 
administration; and follows a known response pattern to the investigational product; and cannot be reasonably 
explained by other factors such as the subject’s clin ical state, therapeutic interventions, or concomitant 
medications administered to the subject; and either occurs immediately following investigational product 
administration, or improves on stopping the investigational product, or reappears on repeat exposure, or there is a 
positive reaction at th e application site. 
 Each adverse event reported will be graded on a 3-point severity. Using the following definitions for rating 
severity will be used: 
 Mild – easily tolerated, causing minimal discomfort, and not interfering with no rmal everyday activities. 
 Moderate – sufficiently discomforting and ma y interfere with normal everyday activities. 
 Severe – incapacitating and/or pr eventing normal everyday activities. 
 
A Serious Adverse Event  (SAE) is any adverse device experience that results in any of the following outcomes:  
death, a life-threatening adverse device experience, in-patient hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization, a 
persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or a congenital  anomaly/birth defect. Important medical events that may 
or may not result in death, be life-thr eatening, or require hospitalization may be  considered a serious adverse device 
experience when, based upon appropriat e medical judgment, they may jeopardi ze the subject or subject may require 
medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition 
 If any of the above adverse events are serious as defined by the FDA Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Title 21, 
special procedures will be followed.  All serious adverse ev ents will be reported within 24 hours of acknowledgment 
to the Sponsor whether or not the serious events are deemed  sampling session-related.  All serious event reporting will 
adhere to 21 CFR part 812 and the IRB will be notified accordingly.  
   
The SAE information will be entered into the database and a desk copy of the complete SAE report will be submitted to the study file.  
 
Adverse events, whether serious or non-serious, will be followed until the condition is resolved, stabilized, otherwise 
explained or the subject is lost to follow-up.  Adverse events will be captured throughout the study and where 
appropriate, medical tests and examinations will be perfor med to document the resolution of event(s). Outcomes may 
be classified as resolved, improved, unchanged, worse, fata l, unknown or lost to follow-up.  Following the resolution 
of any study-associated adverse events there will be  no further adverse event reports for that subject.

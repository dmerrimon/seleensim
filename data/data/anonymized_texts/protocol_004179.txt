CONFIDENTIAL    Protocol Synopsis  
Title:   Open Label Study to Evaluate the Efficacy of Etanercept Treatment in Subjects With 
Moderate to Severe Plaque Psoriasis Who Have Failed Therapy With Apremilast  
Study Phase:   4 
Indication:  Plaque Psoriasis (PsO)  
Primary Objective:   To evaluate the efficacy of etanercept at week 12 as measured by a 75% 
improvement in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI 75) in adult subjects with moderate to 
severe plaque PsO who have failed therapy with apremilast (Otezla) 
Secondary Objective s:  To evaluate the effect of treatment with etanercept on other efficacy 
endpoints (PASI, Static Physician ’s Global Assessment [sPGA], Body Surface Area [BSA]) , and 
patient reported outcomes (PRO), including Psoriasis Symptom Inventory (PSI) , Patient 
Assessment of Treatment Satisfaction, and Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI)  
Safety Objective:   To evaluate the safety and tolerability of etanercept in apremilast failures   
Hypotheses:   A formal hypothesis will not be tested in this study.   This study will estimate the 
proportion of subjects with PsO who achieve a PASI 75 after 12 weeks of treatment with 
etanercept following failure of treatment with apremilast.  
Primary Endpoint:  PASI 75 at week 12  
Secondary Endpoints:   
• PASI 75 at all other visits  
• PASI 50 and 90 at all visits  
• Percent PASI improvement at all visits  
• sPGA of 0 or 1 at all visits  
• sPGA of 0, 1, or 2 at all visits  
• sPGA at all visits  
• One and two grade improvement in sPGA at all visits  
• Percent BSA improvement at all visits  
• PSI and  component scores at all visits  
• Patient Assessment of Treatment Satisfaction at week 12 and 24  
• Improvement in DLQI at week 12 and 24  
Safety Endpoints: 
• Adverse  events  
• Laboratory assessments  
Study Design:  This is a multicenter, open- label, single- arm, phase 4, estimation study in 
subjects with PsO who have failed apremilast.  Approximately 80 subjects will be enrolled in the 
study of which at least 10 subjects (and not to exceed 20) will be enrolled for reasons of intolerability to apremilast in the investigator’s opinion. The remaining 60 to 70 subjects will be enrolled for reasons of primary or secondary failure to apremilast in the investigator’s opinion. The study will consist of a screening period of up to 45 days, a 24- week treatment period with 
study visi ts every 4 -weeks,  and a 30- day follow -up period for safety. Etanercept dosing will follow 
the recommended label dosing for subjects with PsO.  
Sample Size:   Approximately 80  subjects will be enrolled in the study.  
Summary of Subject Eligibility Criteria: The study seeks to enroll male and female subjects    
(≥ 18 years of age)  with moderate to severe plaque PsO defined by BSA ≥ 10%, sPGA ≥ 3, and 
PASI ≥ 10 at screening  and baseline who have failed therapy with apremilast either because of 
failure to achieve adequate response, loss of adequate response or intolerability in the opinion of

CONFIDENTIAL    the investigator. Female subjects of childbearing potential must have a negative serum 
pregnancy test within 4 weeks from starting etanercept and a negative urin e pregnancy test at 
baseline. For a full list of eligibility criter ia, please refer to Section 4.1.1 through Section  4.1.2.  
Investigational Product:   Etanercept will be supplied in a single- use prefilled 1.0 mL syringe as 
a sterile, clear and color less, preservative- free solution for subcutaneous injection.   Each 
single- use prefilled syringe contains 0.98 mL of 50 mg/mL etanercept . Etanercept will be provided 
with  4 syringes to a pack.  
Amgen Investigational Product Dosage and Administration:  Etanercept dosing will follow the 
recommended label dosing for patients with PsO: 50 mg subcutaneously  twice weekly for 
12 weeks followed by 50 mg once weekly for the additional 12 weeks.   
Procedures:   Written informed consent must be obtained from all subjects  before any screening 
procedures are performed. The following procedures will occur per the Schedule of Assessments:  
medical and medication history, physical exam, vital signs, height and weight, tuberculosis 
testing, hepatitis testing, urinalysis, assessment of the sPGA score, PASI score and assessment 
of involved BSA. Blood samples will be collected for hematology, chemistry, and for all females  
(except those who have had a hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy or bilateral oophorectomy, 
or who are at least 2 years postmenopausal)  to conduct a serum pregnancy test. The treatment 
period will be 24 weeks in duration with st udy visits every 4  weeks. Baseline evaluations will be 
performed on day 1 of treatment before subjects receive the first dose of etanercept . The 
following procedures will be performed at baseline (day 1) and during the treatment period: 
interim physical  exam, vital signs , weight  , PASI, B SA, sPGA, blood samples, urinalysis (day 1 
only) and urine pregnancy tests when required per schedule of assessments.  PROs  will be 
collected at day 1 and during the treatment period. Adverse events, disease related events,  
serious adverse events and changes in concomitant  medications will be recorded throughout the 
treatment period. Investigational product will be dispensed at baseline and every 4 weeks .up to 
week 20. Approximately 30 days after the last dose of etanercept , subjects will receive a final 
safety  follow -up phone call to confirm the status of any ongoing and/or new disease related 
events or serious adverse events . The overall study design is described by a study schema  at the 
end of this synopsis section . For a full list of study procedures, including the timing of each 
procedure, please refer to Section 7 and the Schedule of Assessments  (Table 1 ).   
Statistical Considerations:  This is an open- label single -arm study. Ninety five percent 
confidence intervals and p- values for estimated response rates will be generated for descriptive 
purposes only. The full analysis set includes all subjects who received at least one dose of  
investigational product during the study. All safety and efficacy endpoints will be analyzed using the full analysis set. For the primary analysis of all efficacy endpoints, missing efficacy data will  
be imputed using last observation carried forward method. A sensitivity analysis will be performed 
using observed cases . There will be no interim analysis.  
For a full description of statistical analysis methods, refer to Section 10.

CONFIDENTIAL    1. OBJECTIVES  
1.1 Primary 
To evaluate the efficacy of etanercept at week 12 as measured by a 75% improvement 
in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI 75) in adult subjects with moderate to severe plaque (PsO)  who have failed therapy with apremilast (Otezla
®).  
1.2 Secondary  
To evaluate the effect of treatment with etanercept on other efficacy endpoints (PASI, Static Physi cian’s  Global Assessment [sPGA], Body Surface Area [BSA]) , and patient 
reported outcomes (PRO), including Psoriasis Symptom Inventory (PSI),  Patient 
assessment of Treatment Satisfaction, and Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) . 
1.3 Safety 
To evaluate the saf ety and tolerability of etanercept in apremilast  failures.  
2. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
2.1 Disease 
PsO is a chronic, often severe,  autoimmune dermatologic condition that affects 
approximately 2% of the world’s population (Menter et al, 2008) . Moderate to severe 
plaque PsO  is, for most patients, a chronic, life- long condition.  Current therapies include 
topical agents (eg, corticosteroids, vitamin D3), phototherapy, oral systemic therapies 
(eg, apremilast, methotrexate, cyclosporine)  and biologics (eg, etanercept, i nfliximab, 
adalimumab, ustekinumab and secukinumab). Many patients nevertheless remain 
untreated, fail to respond or lose response to therapy over time, or suffer from toxicities 
associated with systemic medication or phototherapy.  
2.2 Apremilast (OTEZLA) Background 
Apremilast is an oral small -molecule inhibitor of phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) specific for 
cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). PDE4 inhibition results in increased intracellular cAMP levels. The specific mechanism(s) by which apremilast exerts it s 
therapeutic action in psoriasis patients is not well defined. OTEZLA
 (apremilast) is 
indicated for the treatment of patients with moderate to severe plaque PsO who are 
candidates for phototherapy or systemic therapy. Refer to the specific section of the 
product label for additional information.  
The safety of apremilast was assessed in 1426 subjects with psoriasis in 3 randomized, 
double- blind, placebo- controlled trials in adult subjects with moderate to severe plaque 
PsO who were candidates for phototherapy or systemic therapy. Subjects were

Protocol Number:  20150252  
Date:  5 February 2016   Page 13 of 61 
CONFIDENTIAL    randomized to receive apremilast 30 mg twice daily or placebo twice daily. Titration was 
used over the first 5 days.  Subjects ranged in age from 18 to 83 years, with an overall median age of 46 years.  Diarrhea (17%), nausea (17%), and upper respiratory tract infection (9%) were the most commonly reported adverse reactions. The most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation for subjects taking apremilast were nausea 
(1.6%), diarrhea (1.0%), and headache (0.8 %). The proportion of subjects with psoriasis 
who discontinued treatment due to any adverse reaction was 6.1% for subjects treated 
with apremilast 30 mg twice daily and 4.1% for placebo- treated subjects. Severe 
worsening of psoriasis (rebound) occurred in 0.3% (4/1184) subjects following 
discontinuation of treatment with apremilast ( Otezla
 prescribing information, 2014 ).

and PSOR -2) enrolled a total of 1257 subjects 18 years of age and older with moderate 
to severe plaque PsO.  Study PSOR -1 enrolled 844 subjects and Study PSOR -2 
enrolled 413 subjects. In both studies, subjects were randomized 2:1 to O tezla  30 mg 
BID or placebo for 16 weeks. Clinical Response at Week 16 in t he PSOR -1 and PSOR -2 
studies was as follows:  
• PSOR -1 
- 33.1% achieved PASI 75 with apremilast vs. 5.3% with placebo 
- 21.7% achieved sPGA clear (0) or almost clear (1) with apremilast vs. 3.9% with 
placebo 
• PSOR -2 
- 28.8% achieved PASI 75 with apremilast vs. 5.8% with placebo 
- 20.4% achieved sPGA clear (0) or almost clear (1) with apremilast vs. 4.4% with placebo 
2.3 Amgen Investigational Product Background :  Etanercept  
Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) is a naturally occurring cytokine that is involved in normal 
inflammatory  and immune responses. It plays a role in the inflammatory process of PsO.  
Elevated levels of TNF are found in involved tissues and fluids of patients with 
rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, and PsO. Two distinct receptors for TNF, a 55 kilodalton (kD) protein (p55) and a 75 kD protein (p75), exist 
naturally as monomeric molecules on cell surfaces and in soluble forms. Biological activity of TNF is dependent upon binding to either cell surface TNF receptor.  
Etanercept is a dimeric fusion protein consisting of the extracellular ligand -binding 
portion of the human 75 k D TNF receptor linked to the Fc portion of human

CONFIDENTIAL    immunoglobulin G1. Etanercept inhibits binding of TNF- α and TNF -β (lymphotoxin alpha 
[LT-α]) to cell surface  TNF receptors, rendering TNF biologically inactive.  
Etanercept is indicated in the United States for the treatment of : 1) moderately to 
severely active RA 2) moderately to severely active polyarticular juvenile idiopathic 
arthritis in patients aged 2 and older; 3) psoriatic arthritis; 4) active ankylosing 
spondylitis; and, 5) adult patients with chronic moderate to severe plaque PsO who are 
candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy. 
Refer to the specific section of the Investigator’s Brochure , or th e product label for 
additional information related to the physical, chemical, and pharmaceutical properties 
and formulation(s).  
2.4 Rationale  
Limited data is available on the efficacy and tolerability of etanercept in patients with inadequate response to aprem ilast.  This study will evaluate the use of etanercept in 
subjects with inadequate response to apremilast for reasons of either primary failure, 
secondary failure or intolerability.  There is a current trend of Dermatologists adopting the use of apremilast  as an oral therapy option for psoriasis. Despite the convenient 
administrative route, it is anticipated that there may  be a growing population of active 
psoriasis patients who will need to be switched or require additional therapy for reasons of failure t o respond to apremilast or intolerance to apremilast. This study aims to 
characterize the response to etanercept in this population.  There is also a need to better 
understand patient oriented measures in psoriasis patients, and this study seeks to 
charact erize PRO including a novel instrument termed the PSI, in response to 
etanercept treatment.  
2.5 Clinical Hypotheses 
A formal hypothesis will not be tested in this study. This study will estimate the proportion of subjects with PsO who achieve a PASI 75 after 12 weeks of treatment with etanercept following failure of treatment with apremilast . 
3. EXPERIMENTAL PLAN  
3.1 Study Design 
This is a multicenter, open- label, single -arm, phase 4 estimation  study in subjects with 
PsO who  have failed apremilast . Approximately 80 subjects will be enrolled in the study, 
among  which at least 10 subjects (and not to exceed 20) will be enrolled for reasons of 
intolerability to apremilast in the investigator’s opinion. The remaining 60 to 70 subjects

Protocol Number:  20150252  
Date:  5 February 2016   Page 15 of 61 
CONFIDENTIAL    will be enrolled for reasons of primary or secondary failure to apremilast in the 
investigator’s opinion.  The study consist s of up to a 45 day screening period, a 24 -week 
treatment period with study visits every 4 weeks and a 30 -day follow -up period for 
safety. Etanercept dosing will follow the recommended label dosing for patients with plaque PsO.  
The overall study design is described by a study schema at the end of the 
protocol  synopsis  section.  
The study endpoints are defined in Section 10.1.1 . 
3.2 N umber of Sites 
Approximately 20 sites in North America  will participate in this study.  Sites that do not

5. SUBJECT ENROLLMENT  
Before subjects begin participation in any study -specific activities/procedures, Amgen 
requires a copy of the site’s written institutional review board/ independent ethics 
committee (IRB/IEC ) approval of the protocol, informed consent form, and all other 
subject information and/or recruitment material, if applicable (see Section 11.2).  All 
subjects must personally sign and date the IRB/IEC and Amgen approved informed 
consent form before commencement of study -specific activit ies/procedures.  
A subject is considered enrolled when the investigator decides that the subject has met 
all eligibility criteria.  The investigator is to document this decision and date, in the 
subject’s medical record and in/on the enrollment case report form ( CRF). 
Each subject who enter s into the screening period for the study (defined as the point at 
which the subject signs the informed consent form) receives a unique subject 
identification number before any study -related activit ies/procedures are performed.  The 
subject identification number will be assigned  by IVR/IWR system. This number will be 
used to identify the subject throughout the clinical study and must be used on all study 
documentation related to that subject.  Subjects who are unable to complete or meet 
eligibility on initial screening will be permitted to re -scree n twice (see Section 7.2.2 ). 
The subject identification number must remain constant throughout the entire clinical study; it must not be changed after initial assignment, including if a subject is rescreened.

6. TREATMENT PROCEDURES  
The Amgen I nvestigat ional Product (s) used in this study include(s) : etanercept .  
The investigational medical device used in this study include(s):  prefilled syringe  
The Investigational Product Instruction Manual (IPIM), a document external to this protocol, contains detailed information regarding the storage, preparation, destruction, 
and administration of etanercept.   
6.1 Investigational Product  
6.1.1 Amgen I nvestigational Product : Etanercept  
Etanercept will be manufactured and packaged by Amgen Inc.  and distributed using 
Amgen clinica l study drug distribution procedures. Etanercept will be supplied in a 
single -use prefilled 1.0 mL syringe as a sterile, preservative- free solution for  
subcutaneous injection. The solution of etanercept is clear and colorless and is 
formulated at pH 6.3 ± 0.2.  Each single -use prefilled syringe contains 0.98 mL of 
50 mg/mL etanercept in a formulation  consisting of 100  mM Sodium Chloride, 25 mM 
sodium phosphate, 25 mM L -Arginine -HCL, and 1% sucrose.   Etanercept will be 
provided in packs with 4 syringes . 
6.1.1.1 Dosage, Administration, and Schedule  
Etanercept dosing will follow the recommended label  dosing for patients with PsO: 
50 mg subcutaneously, twice weekly for 12 weeks followed by 50 mg  subcutaneously 
once weekly (for the additional 12 weeks).  
Each dose of etanercept will consist of the complete contents of 1 pre -filled syringe. 
Injections should occur in the thigh, abdomen or outer area of the upper arm.  The 
injection site should be rotated with each dose . 
During the first 12 weeks of the study, subjects  will receive 2 doses of etanercept per 
week (eg, on Monday and Thursday).  During the second 12 weeks of the study, subjects will receive 1 dose of etanercept per week  (scheduled approximately 7 days 
apart). Throughout the entire trial, administration of etane rcept should occur on the 
scheduled day; however, if unavoidable, it may be given earlier or later as long as the 
dose is not within 2 days of the next scheduled dose. If the  dosing window is missed, 
 
  Product:  Etanercept  
Protocol Number:  20150252  
Date:  5 February 2016   Page 22 of 61 
CONFIDENTIAL    that dose should be skipped. Subsequent doses of etanerc ept should resume on the 
original schedule. If etanercept is to be taken the day of a study  visit, it must be taken 
after the study visit has occurred.  
Injections of etanercept will be administered by the subject or a caregiver. The individual  
administerin g the dose must demonstrate to the site staff that he or she is competent to 
correctly administer the subcutaneous doses. The first dose of etanercept must be 
administered at the study site. All subsequent doses will be administered at the subject’s  
locati on on the scheduled dose day. Supplies of etanercept will be dispensed to subjects  
for administration at home. The subject will be instructed in appropriate handling and storage of used and unused syringes.   
The dose, start date, stop date, dose time and box number of etanercept are to be  
recorded on each subject’s CRF.  
The effects of overdose of etanercept are not known.  
There may not be any adjustment of etanercept dosage other than the protocol -specified 
reduction from 50 mg twice weekly for the first 12 weeks of the study to 50 mg once 
weekly for the second 12 weeks. Please refer to the US Prescribing Information  or the Etanercept Investigator’s  Brochure 
for the most recent safety  information.  
6.2 Hepatotoxicity Stopping and Rechallenge Rules 
Subjects with abnormal hepatic laboratory values ( ie, alkaline phosphatase [ALP], AST, 
ALT, TBL , and/or international normalized ratio [INR] and/or signs/symptoms  of 
hepatitis ) as described below may meet the criteria for withholding or permanent 
discontinuation of Amgen investigational product or other protocol -required therapies  as 
specified in the Guidance for Industry Drug -Induced Liver Injury:   Premarketing Clinical 
Evaluation, July 2009.

CONFIDENTIAL    6.2.1 Criteria for Permanent Discontinuation of Amgen Investigational 
Product Due to Potential Hepatotoxicity  
Etanercept should be discontinued permanently and the subject should be followed 
according to the recommendations in Appendix  A (Additional Safety Assessment 
Information) for possible drug -induced liver injury (DILI), if ALL of the criteria below are 
met:  
• TBL > 2x ULN or INR >  1.5 
• AND increased AST or ALT from the relevant baseline value as specified below:  
Baseline AST or ALT value  AST or ALT elevation  
< 1.5x ULN > 3x ULN  
• AND no other cause for the combination of the above laboratory abnormalities is 
immediately apparent; important alternative causes for elevated AST/ALT and/or  
TBL values include, but are not limited to:  
− Hepatobiliary tract disease 
− Viral hepatitis (eg, Hepatitis A/B/ C/D/E, Epstein -Barr Virus, cytomegalovirus, 
Herpes Simplex Virus, Varicella, toxoplasmosis, and Parvovirus ) 
− Right sided heart failure, hypotension or any cause of hypoxia to the liver causing ischemi a.   
− Exposure to hepatotoxic agents/drugs or  hepatotoxins , including herbal and 
dietary supplements, plants and mushrooms   
− Heritable disorders causing impaired glucuronidation (eg, Gilbert’s Syndrome, 
Crigler- Najjar syndrome) and drugs that inhibit bilirubin glucuronidation (eg, 
indinavir, atazanavir)  
− Alpha- one antitrypsin deficiency  
− Alcoholic hepatitis  
− Autoimmune hepatitis  
− Wilson’s disease and hemochromatosis  
− Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease including Steatohepatitis  
− Non-hepatic causes (eg, rhabdomylosis, hemolysis ) 
If an alternative cause for hepatotoxicity is identified or less stringent conditions 
developed than what are noted above, determine (based on patient population and/or 
severity of the hepatotoxicity or event) if etanercept should be withheld or permanently 
discontinued, as deemed appropriate for the safety of the subject .  
6.2.2 Criteria for Conditional  Withholding of Amgen Investigational 
Product Due to Potential Hepatotoxicity  
For subjects  who do not meet the criteria for permanent discontinuation of etanercept 
outlined above and have no underlying liver disease, and eligibility criteria requiring

CONFIDENTIAL    transaminases and TBL < 1.5x ULN at baseline or subjects with underlying liver disease 
and baseline abnormal transaminases, the following rules are recommended for 
withholding of Amgen investigational product and other protocol -required therapies:  
• Elevation of either AST or ALT according to the following schedule:  
Baseline AST or ALT value  AST or ALT  elevation  
Any > 8x ULN at any time  
Any > 5x ULN but <  8x ULN for ≥ 2 weeks  
Any > 5x ULN but <  8x ULN and unable to adhere to enhanced 
monitoring s chedule  
Any > 3x ULN with clinical signs or symptoms that are 
consistent with hepatitis (such as right upper quadrant pain/tenderness, fever, nausea, vomiting, jaundice).   
• OR: TBL >  3x ULN at any time  
• OR: ALP >  8x ULN at any time  
Etanercept should  be withheld pending investigation into alternative causes of DILI.  If  
investigational product (s) is withheld, the subject is to be followed according to  
recommendations in Appendix  A for possible DILI.  Rechallenge may be considered if an 
alternative cause for impaired liver tests (ALT, AST, ALP) and/or elevated TBL, is 
discovered and the laboratory abnormalities resolve to normal or baseline 
(Section 6.2.3 ). 
6.2.3 Criteria for Rechallenge of Amgen Investigational Product After 
Potential Hepatotoxicity 
The decision to rechallenge the subject should be discussed and agreed upon unanimously by the subject, investigator , and Amgen.  
If signs or symptoms recur with rechallenge, then etanercept should be permanently discontinued.  Subjects who clearly meet the criteria for permanent discontinuation (as described in Section 6.2.1 ) should never be rechallenged.  
6.3 Concomitant Therapy  
Throughout the study, investigator s may prescribe any concomitant medications or 
treatments deemed necessary to provide adequate supportive care except for those listed in Section 6.6.

7. STUDY PROCEDURES  
Screening assessments and study procedures outlined in this section and in Table 1  
(Schedule of Asses sments) can only be performed after obtaining informed consent.  
This includes any discontinuation of the subject’s medication for the purpose of 
participation in this study.  
All study visits should be scheduled from day 1 (date of the first dose of etanercept) of 
the study.  It is very important to attempt to perform study procedures and obtain samples at the precise timepoints stipulated  in Table  1.  When it is not possible to 
perform the study visit at the exact timepoint, the visit may be performed within the acceptable visit window as defined in the visit -specif ic in Table 1 .  
With the exception of the screening and re- screen visits, all study procedures for a visit 
should be completed on the same day.  Any missed visits, tests not done, or examinations that are not conducted must be reported as such on the CRFs.  
Subsequent study visits should resume on the original schedule.  Missed assessments at prior visits should not be duplicated at subsequent visits.

CONFIDENTIAL    7.2 General Study Procedures  
The procedures performed at each study visit are outlined above in Table 1 .  Details 
regarding each type of procedure are provided in subsequent sub- sections .   
Refer to the applicable supplemental central laboratory, IVR/I WR system , IPIM, and 
study manuals for detailed collection and handling procedures.   
7.2.1 Screening  
Informed consent must be obtained before completing any other screening procedure or 
discontinuation of standard therapy for any disallowed therapy. After signing the written 
informed consent form, site will register the subject in IVR/IWR and screen the subject in 
order to assess eligibility for participation. The screening window is up to 45 days. If a 
subject has not met all eligibility criteria at the end of the 45-day window, the subject will 
be registered as a screen fail. Screen fail subjects may be el igible for re -screening twice 
as described in Section 7.2.2 .  
7.2.2 Re-screening  
Subjects who are unable to complete or meet eligibility on initial screening will be permitted to re- screen twice . Re-screen subjects must first be registered as screen failed 
in IVRS/IWRS system and subsequently registered as re- screened. Subjects will retain 
the same subject identification number assigned at the original screening. Once the 
subject is registered as re- screened, a new 45-day screening window will begin.  If the 
re- screening period begins more than 30 days after the original signing of the informed 
consent form, all screening procedures, including informed consent must be repeated. If the re- screening occurs less than 30 days after the original signing of the informed 
consent, then only those criteria that were originally failed are required to be repeated. The PPD test, chest X -ray, and Quantiferon will not need to be repeated for re- screen 
subjects if negative at the original screening. However, subjects screen- failing for and 
not meeting the tuberculosis testing inclusion criterion are not permitted to re -screen.  
7.2.3 Treatment  
Visits will occur per the Schedule of Assessments ( Table  1) during the treatment period 
from day 1 (baseline) through week 24. On- study visits may be completed within 
± 5 days of the target visit date. Prior to enrollment, subject eligibility must be confirmed 
with screening procedures. Subjects satisfying eligibility requirements will be enrolled. The date of the first dose of etanercept is defined as day 1 (baseline). All subsequent 
doses and study visits will be scheduled based on the day 1 date.  
 
  Product:  Etanercept

visits that will include dosing. Subjects ending the study prior to week 24 will be asked to 
complete the unscheduled early termination (ET) visit assessments which are the same 
as those listed in the Schedule of Assessments  under  Week 24/ET.  
7.2.4 Safety Follow -up/End of Study  
Approximately 30 days (+ 7 days) after their last dose of etanercept, subjects will be 
contacted by phone by the study staff to follow -up on any continuing serious adverse 
events or disease related events and inquire about the emergence of any new serious 
adverse events  or disease related events . 
7.3 Description of Study Procedures

name, indication, dose and start date and stop date.  
7.3.5 Physical Measurements 
Height in inches and w eight in pounds should be measured without shoes.   
7.3.6 Vital Signs  
The following measurements must be performed: systolic/diastolic blood pressure, heart 
rate, respiratory rate, and temperature. Subject must be in a supine position in a rested and calm state for at least 5 minutes before blood pressure assessments are conducted.  If the subject is unable to be in the supine position, the subject should be in most 
recumbent position possible. The position selected for a subject should be the same 
throughout the study and documented on the vital signs CRF.  The temperature  location 
selected for a subject should be the same throughout the study and documented on the 
vital signs CRF.  If abnormalities are found and they are considered an adverse event, 
record on the Event CRF . 
7.3.7 Chest Radiograph  
Subjects with a positive PPD test without a history of Bacillus Calmette- Guerin 
vaccination or subjects with a positive or indeterminate Quantiferon test will require a chest radiograph including posterior -anterior a nd lateral views performed within 
3 months prior to the first dose of investigational product. The radiograph report should 
be read by a radiologist or per local requirement and the report must be reviewed by the 
investigator prior to enrollment of the subject.  
7.3.8 Adverse Events and Disease Related Events 
Adverse events, serious adverse events  and disease related events observed by the 
investigator or reported by the subject will be collected as per Section 9. 
7.3.9 Concomitant Medications

self-administered in the clinic. Subject is to record the date, time, dose of etanercept 
injection, injection site, etanercept box ID, any concomitant medications taken, and 
adverse events.  
7.3.10.2 Collection and Review  
Subjects will return the diary at each study visit . . Site staff will review the diary with the 
subject to confirm the subject accurately reported all required information, including adverse events and concomitant medications, and will clarify entries, as necessary. Site staff will enter the data into the CRF. 
7.3.11 Disease Assessments 
The assessor who performs the following assessments will be a licensed healthcare 
professional who has been certified as trained by Amgen  standard training material for  
PASI, sPGA and BSA provided by Amgen OR who has been previously certified as 
trained with the standard training material provided by Amgen or by organizations such as Group for Research and Assessment of Psoriasis and Psoriatic Arthritis (GRAPPA) 
(documentation of certification must be provided to Amgen).  If possible, each subject should have their assessments done by the same assessor throughout the study. If 
necessary, study visits may be rescheduled within the specified window “(± 3 days ) to 
accommodate when the specific assessor will be available.  
7.3.11.1 PASI 
PASI score (0 to 72) is a calculation of plaque qualities, including induration, erythema, and desquamation, and the area involved with psoriasis. The assessor will score plaque qualities (0 to 4) and area of involvement (0 to 6) for each of 4 body areas: head and neck, upper extremities, trunk, and lower extremities. Higher scores indicate more 
severe and/or extensive psoriasis. The PASI worksheet will be signed and dated by the 
PASI assessor and maintained in the subject’s source documents.  
7.3.11.2 BSA Involvement  
The involved BSA numerical score (0% to 100%) is completed by the same assessor performing the sPGA assessment and will be used to measure the physician’s 
assessment of the proportion of the subject’s total BSA involved with psoriasis.  
7.3.11.3 sPGA 
The sPGA is designed to evaluate the physician’s global assessment of the subject’s psoriasis based on severity of induration, scaling, and erythema.  The sPGA is assessed 
 
  Product:  Etanercept  
Protocol Number:  20150252  
Date:  5 February 2016  Page 34 of 61 
CONFIDENTIAL    on a scale of 0 to 5.  It is important that each subject have their sPGA assessments 
done by the same assessor throughout the study.   
7.3.12 Patient Reported Outcomes  
7.3.12.1 Psoriasis Symptom Inventory  
The subject will be asked to rate the severity of their psoriasis signs and symptoms on an 8- item questionnaire ( itch, redness, scaling, burning, stinging, cracking, flaking, pain).  
Each item is scored from 0 (not at all severe) to 4 (very severe) .  A 7 -day recall period 
will be utilized and the PSI will be completed by the subject on paper version at baseline and weeks 1, 2, 3 and then at each visit.  
7.3.12.2  Patient Assessment of Treatment Satisfaction  
The subject will be asked to check a box (from “very dissati sfied” to “very satisfied”) to 
indicate his or her level of satisfaction with the medication’s control of psoriasis.  The response scale is adapted from the Medical Outcomes Study: Patient Satisfaction 
Survey.  
7.3.12.3 Dermatology Life Quality Index  
Health related quality of life will be evaluated using the DLQI, a skin disease-specific 
instrument that has been validated for use in patients with psoriasis 
(Finlay  and Khan,  1994 ).  
7.4 Laboratory Assessments 
All screening and on -study laboratory samples will be processed  and sent to the central 
laboratory with the exception of urine pregnancy and PPD . The central laboratory will be 
responsible for all screening and on- study serum chemistry, hematology, serum 
pregnancy, urinalysis, hepatitis C antibody, hepatitis B surface antigen and core 
antibody, and any other laboratory tests required. Urine pregnancy and PPD testing will be performed locally at each site . The results of this testing will be maintained in the 
source documents at the site.  
The central   laboratory will p rovide a study manual that outlines handling, labeling, and 
shipping  procedures for all samples. All blood samples will be obtained by venipuncture 
before  etanercept  administration  (if etanercept is to be administered on the same day as 
a study visit) at t he time points outlined in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1 ). The 
date and time of sample collection will be recorded in the source documents at the site.  
Specific analytes for serum chemistry, hematology, urinalysis, and other testing to be conducted on blood and urine samples are below  (Table  2).

7.4.1 T uberculosis Testing  
All subjects must receive either a PPD or Quantif eron test at screening per the Inclusion 
Criteria.  PPD testing should be performed unless contraindicated.   
7.4.1.1 PPD 
The PPD test must be read by a trained licensed healthcare professional 48 to 72 hours 
after the test material is placed intradermally under t he skin. PPD test kits will not be 
provided by the sponsor and must be procured locally.  
7.4.1.2 Quantiferon  
If a subject does not receive a PPD test, then a Quantiferon test must be performed per 
the Inclusion Criteria.  Please refer to the central laboratory manual for instructions on 
sample collection, processing, and shipping of samples (if applicable).     
7.4.2 Urine Pregnancy Test

must take a urine pregnancy test at baseline.  The central laboratory will provide the urine pregnancy tests.  Urine pregnancy tests must be given prior to dispensing 
investigational product.    
7.5 Sample Storage and Destruction  
Any blood sample collected according to the Schedule of Assessments (Table  1) can be 
analyzed for any of the tests out lined i n the protocol and for any tests necessary to 
minimize risks to study subjects.  This includes testing to ensure analytical methods 
produce reliable and valid data  throughout the course of the study .  This can also 
include, but is not limited to, investigation of unexpected results, incurred sample reanalysis, and analyses for method transfer and comparability.  
All samples and associated results will be coded prior to being shipped from the site for analysis or storage.  Samples will be tracked using a unique identifier that is assigned to the samples for the study.  Results are stored in a secure database to ensure confidentiality.    
If informed consent is provided by the subject,  Amgen can  do additional testing on 
remaining samples (ie, residual and back -up) to investigate and better understand the 
inflammatory conditions , the dose response and/or prediction of response to etanercept , 
and characterize aspects of the molecule (eg, mechanism of action/target, metabolites).  
Results from this analysis are to be documented and maintained, but are not necessarily 
reported as part of this study.  Samples can be retained for up to 20 years.   
Since the evaluations are not expected to benefit the subject directly or to alter the 
treatment course, the results of exploratory studies  are not placed in the subject’s 
medical record and are not to be made available to the subject, members of the family, 
the personal physician, or other third parties , except as specified in the informed 
consent.  
The subject retains the rig ht to request that the sample material be destroyed by 
contacting the investigator .  Following the request from the subject, the investigator is to 
provide the sponsor with the required study and subject number so that any remaining 
blood samples and any other components from the cells can be located and destroyed.   
Samples will be destroyed once all protocol -defined procedures are completed.   
However, information collected from samples prior to the request for destruction, will be 
retained by Amgen.

CONFIDENTIAL    The sp onsor is the exclusive owner of any data, discoveries, or derivative materials from 
the sample materials and is responsible for the destruction of the sample(s) at the 
request of the subject through the investigator , at the end of the storage period, or as  
appropriate (eg, the scientific rationale for experimentation with a certain sample type no longer justifies keeping the sample).  If a commercial product is developed from this 
research project, the sponsor owns the commercial product.  The subject has no 
commercial rights to such product and has no commercial rights to the data, information, 
discoveries, or derivative materials gained or produced from the sample.  See 
Section 11.3 for subject confidentiality.  
8. WITHDRAWAL FROM TREATMENT, PROCEDURES, AND STUDY  
8.1 Subjects’ Decision to Withdraw  
Subjects have the right to withdraw from the study at any time and for any reason 
without prejudice to their future medical care by the physician or at the institution. 
Subject s (or a legally acceptable representative) can decline to continue receiving 
investigational product and/or other protocol -required therapies or procedures at any 
time during the study  but continue participation in the study .  If this occurs, the 
investiga tor is to discuss with the subject the appropriate processes for discontinuation 
from investigational product or other protocol -required therapies and must discuss with 
the subject t he options for continuation of the Schedule of Assessments  (Table 1 ) and 
collection of data, including endpoints and adverse events .  The investigator  must 
document the change to the Schedule of Assessments  (Table  1) and the level of 
follow -up that is agreed to by the subject ( eg, in person, by telephone/mail, through 
family/friends, in correspondence/communication with other physicians, from review of the medical records ).   
Withdrawal of consent for a study means that the subject does not wish t o receive 
further protocol -required therapies or procedures , and the subject does not wish to or is 
unable to continue further study participation .  Subject data up to withdrawal of consent 
will be included in the analysis of the study , and where permitted, publically available 
data can be included after withdrawal of consent.  The investigator is to discuss with the 
subject appropriate procedures for withdrawal from the study.

Subjects’ Participation Prior to Study Completion  
The investigator and /or sponsor can decide to withdraw a subject(s) from investigational 
product and/or other protocol- required therapies, protocol procedures , or the study as a 
whole at any time prior to study completion.    
Subjects may be eligible for continued treatment with Amgen investigational product (s) 
and/or other protocol -required therapies by a separate protocol or as provided for by the 
local country’s regulatory mechanism, based on parameters consistent with 
Secti on 12.1. 
8.3 Reasons for Removal From Treatment , or Study  
8.3.1 Reasons for Removal From Treatment  
Reasons for removal from protocol -required investigational product(s) or procedural 
assessments include any of the followi ng: 
• subject request   
• safety concern (eg, due to an adverse event, ineligibility determined, protocol 
deviation, non- compliance, requirement for alternative therapy, pregnancy)  
• death  
• lost to follow -up 
• decision by Sponsor  (other than subject request, safety  concern, lost to follow -up) 
8.3.2 Reasons for Removal From Study  
Reasons for removal of a subject from the study  are: 
• decision by sponsor  
• withdrawal of consent  from study  
• death  
• lost to follow -up 
9. SAFETY DATA COLLECTION, RECORDING, AND REPORTING  
9.1 Definition of Safety Events 
9.1.1 Disease Related Events 
Disease Related Events are events (serious or non- serious) anticipated to occur in the 
study population due to the underlying disease.  Disease related events for the purposes 
of this study include worsening of the skin symptoms associated with PsO.  Such events 
do not meet the definition of an Adverse Event unless assessed to be more severe than expected for the subject’s condition.  
 
  Product:  Etanercept  
Protocol Number:  20150252  
Date:  5 February 2016  Page 39 of 61 
CONFIDENTIAL    Disease Related Events and/or Disease Related Outcomes that do not qualify as 
Serious Adverse Events:  
• An event which is part of the normal course of disease under study (eg, disease 
progression in oncology or hospitalization due to disease progression) is to be 
reported as a Disease Related Event.  
• Death due to the disease under study is to be recorded on the Event CRF.  
If the outcome of the underlying disease is worse than that which would normally be 
expected for the subject, or if the investigator  believes there is a causal relationship 
between the investigational product(s)/study treatment  protocol required therapies and 
disease worsening, this must  be reported as an Adverse Event or  Serious Adverse 
Event.  
9.1.2 Adverse Events  
An adverse event is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical trial subject.  The event does not necessarily have a causal relationship with study treatment.  
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that any adverse events observed by the 
investigator or reported by the subject are recorded in the subject’s medical record.   
The definition of adverse events includes  worsening of a pre -existing medical condition.  
Worsening indicates that the pre -existing medical condition or underlying disease (eg, 
diabetes, migraine headaches, gout) has increased in severity, frequency, and/or duration more than would be expected , and/or has an association with a significantly 
worse outcome  than expected.  A pre -existing condition that has not worsened more 
than anticipated (ie, more than usual fluctuation of disease) during the study or involves 
an intervention such as elective cosmetic surgery or a medical procedure while on study , 
is not considered an adverse event.   
An adverse device effect is any adverse event related to the use of a medical device.  
Adverse device effects include adverse events resulting from insuffic ient or inadequate  
instructions for use, adverse events resulting from any malfunction of the device, or  
adverse events resulting from use error or from intentional misuse of the device.   
The investigator’s clinical judgment is used to determine whether a subject is to be 
removed from treatment due to an adverse event.  In the event a subject, or subject’s

CONFIDENTIAL    9.1.3 Serious Adverse Events 
A serious adverse event is defined as an adverse event that meets at least 1 of the 
following serious criteria (unless it meets the definition of a Disease Related Event as 
defined in Section 9.1.1 ): 
• fatal 
• life threatening (places the subject at immediate risk of death)  
• require s in-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization 
• results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• other medically important serious event  
A disease related event as described above is to be reported as a serious adverse event 
if:  
• the subject’s pre -existing condition becomes worse than what the investigator would 
consider typical for a patient with the same underlying condition, or 
• if the investigator believes a causal relationship exists between the investigational 
medicinal product(s)/protocol -required therapies  and the event ,  
• and the event meets at least 1 of the serious criteria above.  
An adverse event would meet the criterion of “requires hospitalization”,  if the event 
necessitated an admission to a health care facility (eg, overnight stay).   
If an investigator considers an event to be clinically important, but it does not meet any 
of the serious criteria, the event could be classified as a serious adverse event under the 
criterion of “o ther medically important serious event”.  Examples of such events could 
include allergic bronchospasm, convulsions, blood dyscrasias, DILI (see Appendix  A for 
drug-induced liver injury reporting criteria), or events that necessitate an emergency 
room visit , outpatient surgery, or urgent intervention. 
9.2 Safety Event Reporting Procedures  
9.2.1 Reporting Procedures for Disease Related Events 
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that all Disease Related Events observed by 
the investigator or reported by the subject that occur after the first dose of investigational medicinal product(s)/study treatment/protocol -required therapies through the safety 
follow -up (ie, 30 days after the last dose of etanercept)  are reported us ing the Event 
CRF.  Additionally, the investigator is required to report a fatal Disease Related Event on 
the Event CRF.   
 
  Product:  Etanercept

Date:  5 February 2016  Page 41 of 61 
CONFIDENTIAL    Events assessed by the investigator to be related to the investigational medicinal 
product(s)/study treatment/protocol -required thera pies, and determined to be serious, 
require reporting of the event on the Event CRF.  
9.2.2 Adverse Events  
9.2.2.1 Reporting Procedures for Adverse Events That do not Meet Serious 
Criteria 
The investigator  is responsible for ensuring that all adverse events observed by the 
investigator  or reported by the subject that occur after first dose of investigational 
product through the end of treatment period are reported using the Event CRF. 
The investigator must assign the following adverse event attributes:  
• Adverse event diagnosis or syndrome(s), if known (if not known, signs or symptoms), 
• Dates of onset and resolution (if resolved) , 
• Severity [and/or toxicity per protocol],  
• Assessment of relatedness to etanercept , and 
• Action taken  
The adverse event grading scale used will be t he Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0.   The grading scale used in this study is described 
in Appendix  A.  The investigator must assess whether the adverse event is possibly 
related t o the investigational product.  This relationship is indicated by a “yes” or “no” 
response to the question:  Is there a reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by  the investigational product ?   
If the severity of an adverse event changes  from the date of onset to the date of 
resolution, record as a single event with the worst severity on the Adverse Event Summary CRF.  
The investigator is responsible for reviewing laboratory test results and determining 
whether an abnormal value in an individual study subject represents a clinically significant change from the subject’s baseline values.  In general, abnormal laboratory findings without clinical significance (based on the investigator's judgment) are not to be 
recorded as adverse events.  However, laboratory value changes that require treatment or adjustment in current therapy are considered adverse events.  Where applicable, clinical sequelae (not the laboratory abnormality) are to be recorded as the adverse 
event.  
 
  Product:  Etanercept  
Protocol Number:  20150252  
Date:  5 February 2016  Page 42 of 61 
CONFIDENTIAL    The Investigator is expect ed to follow reported adverse events until stabilization or 
reversibility.  
9.2.2.2 Reporting Procedures for Serious Adverse Events  
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that all serious adverse events observed by 
the investigator or reported by the subject  that occur after signing of the informed 
consent   through the 30- day safety follow -up period are recorded in the subject’s 
medical record and are submitted to Amgen.   All serious adverse events must be 
submitted to Amgen within 24 hours following the investigator’s knowledge of the event 
via the Event CRF.   
The investigator must assess whether the serious adverse event is possibly related to any study -mandated activity or procedure.  This relationship is indicated by a “yes” or 
“no” response to the question:  “Is there a reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by a study activity/procedure”?  
The investigator is expected to follow reported serious adverse events until stabilization or reversibility.  
If the electronic data capture (EDC) system is unavailable to the site staff to report the serious adverse event, the information is to be reported to Amgen via an electronic Serious Adverse Event Contingency Report Form within 24 hours of the investigator’s knowledge of the event.  See Appendix  B for a sample of the Serious Adverse Event 
Worksheet /electronic Serious Adverse Event Contingency Report Form.  For EDC 
studies  where the first notification of a Serious Adverse Event is reported to Amgen via 
the eSerious Adverse Event Contingency Report Form, the data must be entered into 
the EDC system when the system is again available.  
New information relating to a previously reported serious adverse event must be submitted to Amgen.   All new information f or serious adverse events must be sent to 
Amgen within 24 hours following knowledge of the new information.  The investigator may be asked to provide additional follow -up information, which may include a discharge 
summary or extracts from the medical recor d.  Information provided about the serious 
adverse event must be consistent with that recorded on the Event CRF.  
If a subject is permanently withdrawn from protocol -required therapies because of a 
serious adverse event, this information must be submitted to Amgen.  
Amgen will report serious adverse events and/or suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions as required to regulatory authorities, investigators/institutions, and IRBs/IECs 
 
  Product:  Etanercept  
Protocol Number:  20150252  
Date:  5 February 2016  Page 43 of 61 
CONFIDENTIAL    in compliance with all reporting requirements according to local regulations and good 
clinical practice .  
The investigator is to notify the appropriate IRB/IEC of serious adverse events occurring at the site and other adverse event reports received from Amgen, in accordance with local procedures and statutes.  
9.2.2.3 Reporting Serious Adverse Events After the Protocol -required 
Reporting Period  
There is no requirement to monitor study subjects for serious adverse events following the protocol -required reporting period or after end of study.  However, these serious 
adverse events can be reported to Amgen.  In some countries (eg, European Union 
member states), investigators are required to report serious adverse events that they become aware of after end of study.  If serious adverse events are reported, the 
investigator is to report them  to Amgen within 24 hours following the investigator’s 
knowledge of the event.  
Serious adverse events reported outside of the protocol -required reporting period will be 
captured within the safety database as clinical trial cases for the  purposes of expedit ed 
reporting.   
9.2.2.4 Serious Adverse Events That Are not to be Reported In an 
Expedited Manner  
The study population involved will have an increased burden of comorbidities which are commonly associated with psoriasis  and may lead to serious adverse events that do not 
need to be reported in an expedited manner.  This includes any serious adverse event attributed to hypertension, obesity, type 2 diabetes , metabolic syndrome, myocardial 
infarction, angina, coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular accident, peripher al 
vascular disease, depression and anxiety. These serious adverse events will be monitored with routine pharmacovigilance on an ongoing basis.  
9.3 Pregnancy and Lactation Reporting  
If a pregnancy occurs in a female subject, or female partner of a male subject, while the 
subject is taking protocol- required therapies  report the pregnancy to Amgen as specified 
below . 
In addition to reporting any pregnancies occurring during the study, investigators should 
monitor for pregnancies that occur after the last dose of  protocol -required therapies 
through 4-weeks after the end of treatment with etanercept.   
 
  Product:  Etanercept  
Protocol Number:  20150252

CONFIDENTIAL    The pregnancy should be reported to Amgen’s Global Patient Safety within 24 hours of 
the investigator’s knowledge of the event  of a pregnancy .  Report a pregnancy on the 
Pregnancy Notification Worksheet ( Appendix  C).   
If a lactation case occurs while the female subject is taking protocol -required therapies 
report the lactation case to Amgen as specified below.  
In addition to reporting a lactation case during the study, investigators should monitor for 
lactation cases that occur after the last dose of protocol- required therapies through 
4 weeks after the end of treatment with etanercept.  
Any lactation case should be reported to Amgen’s Global Patient Safety within 24 hours  
of the investigator’s knowledge of event .  Report a lactation case on the Lactation 
Notification Worksheet (Appendix  C). 
10. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS

CONFIDENTIAL    10.1.2 Analysis Sets  
The full analysis set is all subjects who received at least one dose of investigational 
product during the study.  All safety and efficacy endpoints will be analyzed using the full 
analysis set.  
10.1.3 Covariates and Subgroups 
The following predictors and subgroup  analyses may be performed  to assess their 
influence on the primary endpoint:  
• Body mass index  (≤ 35 kg/m2  or > 35 kg/m2) 
• Body Weight  (≤ median, > median)  
• Age (<65, ≥ 65) 
• Gender (male vs.  female)  
• Race (white, non -white ) 
• Ethnicity (Hispanic or Latino, Non- Hispanic or Latino)  
• Baseline PASI score ( ≤ median, > median)  
• Baseline BSA with psoriasis involvement (%) ( ≤ median, > median)  
• History of psoriatic arthritis (yes, no)  
• Baseline sPGA sc ore (3, 4 or 5)  
10.2 Sample Size Considerations  
This study will estimate the proportion of subjects with PsO who achieve a PASI 75 after 12 weeks of treatment with etanercept following failure of treatment with apremilast.   
In recent etanercept studies, the 12- week PASI 75 response rate for etanercept was 
~50 to 60%.  The assumed response for a population with failure of treatment with 
apremilast is 40%.  In placebo- controlled phase 3 studies, the PASI 75 placebo 
response rate was ~5% in subjects with moderate to severe plaque PsO.  Therefore, in 
this single -arm study if the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval for the proportion 
of PASI 75 response is above 10%, we can safely conclude that in spite of limitations of 
a single -arm study (i e, regression to the mean and/or placebo effect), the etanercept 
effect is real.  
The sample size of 80 is more than adequate to achieve a half -width of less than 15% 
for the 95% confidence interval for the proportion of subjects who achieve a PASI 75 
response, assuming a sample proportion of 40% and a lower bound of the confidence interval above 10%.

CONFIDENTIAL    In a phase 3, randomized, double- blind, placebo- controlled apremilast trial, 17% of 
subjects reported diarrhea and/or nausea.   Of the 80 subjects enrolled, 60 subjects will 
be enrolled for reasons of primary or secondary failure to apremilast in the investigator’s 
opinion. In addition, between 10 and 20 (up to 25%) will be enrolled for reasons of 
intolerability to apremilast in the investigator’s opinion.    
10.2.1 Planned Analysi s 
10.2.2 Primary Analysis 
The primary analysis for all efficacy endpoints will be performed using the full analysis set. Missing values will be imputed using last observation carried forward method. 
Summary statistics will be generated as well as confidence intervals and p -values. No 
multiplicity adjustments will be made for the p- values.  
No interim analysis is planned for this study.  
10.2.3 Sensitivity Analysis 
A sensitivity analysis will be performed using observed cases.  
10.3 Planned Methods of Analysis  
10.3.1 General Considerations 
This is an open -label single -arm study. 95% confidence intervals and p- values for 
estimated response rates will be generated for descriptive purposes only.  
The final analysis will be performed after all subjects have completed the week 24 
assessments and all data through week 24 and the 30- day safety follow -up (EOS) have 
been finalized. Subject disposition, demographics, and baseline disease characteristics 
will be summarized descriptively for all subjects.  
10.3.2 Efficacy  Endpoint s 
The primary analysis for all efficacy endpoints will be performed using the full analysis set. Missing values will be imputed using last observation carried foraward method. 
Summary statistics will be generated as well as confidence intervals and p -values.  
For efficacy analyses, all categorical endpoints will be summarized using number and percentage of subjects. In addition to being summarized using number and percentage of subjects, ordinal categorical endpoints will also be summarized using number of observations, mean, standard error, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum. All continuous endpoints will be summarized using number of observations, mean, standard error, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum.  
Subgroup analysis may be considered as described in Section 10.1.3.

CONFIDENTIAL    The investigator agrees to cooperate with the clinical monitor to ensure that any 
problems detected in the course of these monitoring visits, including delays in 
completing CRFs, are resolved.  
In accordance with ICH GCP and the sponsor’s audit plans, this study may be selected for audit by representatives from Amgen’s Global R&D Compliance and Audit  (or 
designees).  Inspection of site facilities (eg, pharmacy, protocol -required therapy storage 
areas, laboratories) and review of study -related records will occur to evaluate the study 
conduct and compliance with the protocol, ICH GCP, and applicable regulatory requirements.  
Data capture for this study is planned to be electronic:  
• All source documentation supporting entries into the CRFs must be maintained and 
readily available.  
• Updates to CRFs will be automatically document ed through the software’s “audit 
trail”.  
• To ensure the quality of clinical data across all subjects and sites, a clinical data 
management review is performed on subject data received at Amgen.  During this 
review, subject data are checked for consistency, omissions, and any apparent 
discrepancies.  In addition, the data are reviewed for adherence to the protocol and 
GCP.  To resolve any questions arising from the clinical data management review 
process, data queries are created in the EDC system database for site resolution 
and subsequently closed by the EDC system or by an Amgen reviewer.  
• The investigator  signs only the Investigator  Verification Form for this electronic data 
capture study or the investigator applies an electronic signature in the EDC system  if 
the study is set up to accept an electronic signature.   This signature indicates that 
investigator inspected or reviewed the data on the CRF, the data queries, and 
agrees with the content.  
Amgen (or designee) will perform self -evident corrections to obvious data errors in the 
clinical trial database, as documented in the Study Specific Self Evident Corrections 
Plan.  Examples of obvious data errors that may be corrected by Amgen (or designee) 
include deletion of obvious duplicate data (eg, same results sent twice with the same date with different visit -week 4 and early termination) and clarifying “other, specify” if 
data are provided (eg, race, physical examination).  Each investigative site will be provided a list of the types of corrections applied to study data at the initiation of the trial and at study closeout.   
12.4 Investigator  Responsibilities for Data Collection

CONFIDENTIAL    stipulated in the protocol for each subject in the study.  For subjects who withdraw prior 
to completion of all protocol- required visits and are unabl e or unwilling to continue the 
Schedule of Assessments  (Table 1 ), the investigator can search publically available 
records [where permitted]) to ascertain survival status.  This ensures that the data set(s) 
produced as an outcome of the study is/are as comprehensive as possible.   
12.5 Language 
All written information and other material to be used by subjects and investigative staff must use vocabulary and language that are clearly understood.   
12.6 Publication Policy  
Authorship of any publications resulting from this study will be determined on the basis of the Recommendations for the Conduct, Reporting, Editing, and Publication of  
Scholarly Work in Medical Journals (International Committee of Medical Journal Editors , 
2013, updated 2014 ), which states:  
• Authorship credit should be based on (1) substantial contributions to conception and 
design, acquisition of data, or analysis and interpretation of data; (2) drafting the 
article or revising it critically for important intellectual content; (3) final approval of the version to be published; (4) a greement to be accountable for all aspects of the work 
in ensuring that questions related to the accuracy or integrity of any part of the work are appropriately investigated and resolved.  Authors  should meet conditions 1, 2, 3 
and 4. 
• When a large, multice nter group has conducted the work, the group should  identify 
the individuals who accept direct responsibility for the manuscript.  These individuals 
should fully meet the criteria for authorship defined above.  
• Acquisition of funding, collection of data, or  general supervision of the research 
group, alone, does not justify authorship.  
• All persons designated as authors should qualify for authorship, and all those who 
qualify should be listed.  
• Each author should  have participated sufficiently in the work to take public 
responsibility for appropriate portions of the content.  
All publications (eg, manuscripts, abstracts, oral/slide presentations, book chapters) 
based on this study must be submitted to Amgen for review.  The Clinical Trial 
Agreement among the inst itution, investigator , and Amgen will detail the procedures for, 
and timing of, Amgen’s review of publications.

Drug-induced Liver Injury Reporting & Additional Assessments  
To facilitate appropriate monitoring for signals of drug induced liver injury ( DILI), cases of 
concurrent AST or ALT and TBL and/or  INR elevation according to the criteria specified 
in Section Reporting  
6.2 require the following:  
• The event is to be reported to Amgen as a serious adverse event within 24 hours of 
discovery or notification of the event (ie, before additional etiologic investigations 
have been concluded) . 
• The appropriate CRF (eg, Event CRF) that captures information necessary to 
facilitate the evaluation of treatment -emergent liver abnormalities is to be completed 
and sent to the Amgen.  
Other  events of hepatotoxicity and potential DILI are to be reported as serious adverse 
events if they meet the criteria for a serious adverse event defined in Section 9.2.2.2 . 
All subjects in whom investigational product is withheld (either permanently or 
conditionally) due to potential DILI as specified in Section Additional Clinical Assessments and Observation  
6.2.1  and 6.2.2  or who 
experience AST or ALT elevations >  3 x ULN are to undergo a period of “close 
observation” until abnormalities return to normal or to the subject’s baseline levels.  Assessments that are to be performed during t his period include:  
• Repeat AST, ALT, ALP, bilirubin  (total and direct), and INR within 24 hours  
• In cases of TBL > 2 x ULN or INR > 1.5, retesting of liver tests, BIL (total and direct), 
and INR is to be performed every 24 hours until laboratory abnormalities improve 
Testing frequency of the above laboratory tests may decrease if the abnormalities 
stabilize or the investigational product(s) or protocol -required therapies has/have been 
discontinued AND the subject is asymptomatic . 
• Initiate investigation of alternative causes for elevated AST or ALT and/or elevated 
TBL:  
− Obtain complete blood count (CBC) with differential to assess for eosinophilia

CONFIDENTIAL    − Obtain serum total immunoglobulin IgG, Anti-nuclear antibody, Anti Smooth 
Muscle Antibody, and Liver Kidney Microsomal antibody 1 to assess for 
autoimmune hepatitis  
− Obtain serum acetaminophen (paracetamol) levels  
− Obtain a more detailed history of:  
• Prior and/or concurrent diseases or illness  
• Exposure to environmental and/or industrial chemical agents  
• Symptoms (if applicable) including right upper quadrant pain, 
hypersensitivity -type reactions, fatigue, nausea, vomiting and fever  
• Prior and/or concurrent use of alcohol, recreational drugs and special diets  
• Concomitant use of medications (including non -prescription medic ines and 
herbal and dietary supplements), plants, and mushrooms  
− Obtain viral serologies  
− Obtain CPK, haptoglobin, LDH, and peripheral blood smear  
− Perform appropriate liver imaging if clinically indicated  
• Obtain appropriate blood sampling for pharmacokinetic  analysis if this has not 
already been collected  
• Obtain hepatology consult ( liver biopsy may be considered in consultation with an 
hepatologist)  
• Follow the subject and the laboratory tests (ALT, AST, TBL, INR) until all laboratory 
abnormalities return to baseline or normal.  The “close observation period” is to 
continue for a minimum of 4 weeks after discontinuation of all investigational 
product(s) and protocol -required therapies.  
The potential DILI event and additional information such as medical history, concomitant 
medications and laboratory results must be captured in corresponding CRFs.

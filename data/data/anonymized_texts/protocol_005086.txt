1. Project  Title:  Continuous Glucose Monitoring for Hyperglycemia in Critically Ill  
Patients  
 
 
2. Abstract:  
The investigators intend to conduct prospective, randomized comparative trial of 
patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU)  at the North Florida/South 
Georgia Veterans Health System who received continuous glucose monitoring 
(CGM) vs standard glucose monitoring. This study will examine several outcomes 
for patients in the ICU with hyperglycemia. The primary outcome of the study 
will be the percentage of time in target range (blood glucose 70 -180 mg/dL). 
Secondary outcomes will include percentage of time in clinically significant 
hypoglycemic (BG < 54 mg/dL), hypoglycemic (BG 54 -69 mg/dL), hyperglycemic 
(BG 181 -250 mg/dL), and clin ically relevant hyperglycemic (BG >250 mg/dL) 
ranges; ICU length of stay, ICU mortality, 30 -day mortality, costs associated with 
monitoring, mean BG, glucose variability between the two groups (% coefficient 
of variation = SD/mean BG*100%), and patient sat isfaction. An evaluation will be 
done to assess the proportions of patients with new infection, acute kidney 
injury (AKI), agitation, delirium, and pain. Correlation between CGM values and 
whole blood values for blood glucose will be evaluated.  
 
3. Background:  
Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a common comorbidity among hospitalized 
patients with over 25% reporting a history of the disease. Furthermore, stress -induced 
hyperglycemia is common in critically ill patients. Among these patients, glucose 
control is a necessit y to avoid further complications. Inpatient hyperglycemia has 
been associated with a longer length of stay, increased risk of infection, and increased 
mortality. Hypoglycemia can be more severe in hospitalized patients and can also 
increase length of stay and mortality. The current standard for glucose monitoring 
involves point -of-care (POC) blood glucose finger sticks or arterial/venous whole 
blood sampling. These methods have limitations and continuous glucose monitors 
(CGMs) offer a potential alternative . 
Continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) were originally designed for use in the 
home and outpatient setting, with less data on its application in the hospital or critical 
care settings. Until April 2020, CGMs were not approved for inpatient use. To 
support COVID -19 healthcare efforts, the FDA allowed for the use of continuous 
glucose monitoring (CGM) systems for the treatment of patients in various healthcare 
facilities. This remote glucose monitoring allowed for conservation of personal 
protectiv e equipment (PP E) and reduction of potential exposure of staff from multiple 
point -of-care glucose checks. Compared to the POC checks every one to two hours, 
CGM systems can provide blood glucose readings multiple times each hour, allowing 
for remote monitoring and the a bility to detect urgent changes in blood glucose.  
Several studies have evaluated the use of CGM among hospitalized patients 
with DM  and have shown positive results when compared to traditional POC glucose 
Protocol  Page 3 of 18 
IRB version 03.09.04  
PI version 10/0/2022  monitoring. Most studies have found the use of CGM can help minimize the number 
of hypoglycemia episodes and overall improve patient care. Similar studies have been 
done in the intensive care unit (ICU) with favorable results; however, these studies 
had sm aller sample sizes and limited external validity. While there is consensus on 
the superiority of CGM detecting hypoglycemic blood glucose levels, the effects on 
other patient outcomes in the critically ill remain uncertain.  
 
4. Study Purpose:  
The purpose of this study is to compare  the use of CGM  versus POC glucose 
monitoring  in the critical care setting for differences in glycemic control and 
other important ICU outcomes.

Protocol  Page 10 of 18 
IRB version 03.09.04  
PI version 10/0/2022  6. Analysis Methods:  
Descriptive statistics and inferential statistical methods will be used as 
appropriate to report findings of this study.  
 
To minimize risk of bias, data collection and analysis will be by performed by 
study team members not involved in the clinical care of the study participants, as 
possible . 
 
7. Possible Discomforts and Risks:  
• Inaccurate measurement of BG which could lead to hypo - and 
hyperglycemia  
• CGMs are minimally invasive but could cause some patients mild physical 
pain or discomfort  
• Apart from the type of monitoring utilized, no further changes to patient 
care will be made. Investigators will not alter  medication prescribing to 
deviate from standard of care. As such, no additional discomfort or risk to 
the patient caused by this study is expected.   
 
8. Possible Benefits:  
• Reduction of serious hypoglycemia or other adverse events is the most 
relevant potential benefit of using CGM  
• Decreased point -of-care finger sticks compared to standard care. This 
may lead to benefits such as increased patient comfort  and reduced 
costs . 
• Possible benefit of improved glycemic control with the ability to monitor 
glucose levels more carefully and adjust treatment as appropriate; this 
could lead to improved patient outcomes. We hypothesize the use of 
CGM will yield less cases of hypoglycemia an d more glucose values at 
goal.  
 
9. Anticipated Costs:  
GGM devices and other necessary equipment will be provided through a 
manufacturer sponsored grant. Administrative and regulatory expenses will be 
covered by a manufacturer sponsored grant. No other costs beyond investigator salary 
and those for routine cli nical care are anticipated.    
 
10. Conflicts of Interest:  
None of the investigators hold a patent or license for any material, object, or 
process involved with this research.  None of the investigators own stock in or 
serve as consultants to any company involved in this research. The researchers 
will not receive payment or other financial incentive for conducting this study.  
 
The PI or any of the Sub -investigators have no real or potential conflict of 
interest with regards to this research project.

▪ Correctional Aspart AC = Medium (2 units:50 mg/dL BG  >150 mg/dL ) 
 
Additional Considerations:  
• Aspart dose should be given immediately prior to meal. If it is unknown if patient 
will eat, hold aspart prior to meal and give after meal if patient consumes at 
least 50%. Give aspart dose within 15 minutes of first bite.  
• If patient is expected not to eat or consumes less than 50% of meal: nurse to 
notify physician, hold scheduled nutritional aspart dose, continue basal glargine, 
and give aspart correctional sliding scale.  
• Correctional aspart to be given in addition to nutritional aspart dose.  
• If blood glucose is less than 100 mg/dl, nurse to hold nutritional/correctional 
insulin and notify physician. Basal insulin should be continued as prescribed 
unless instructed otherwise by physician orders.  
• If patient has abrupt change in diet (e.g. made NPO for urgent procedure), nurse 
to notify physician. It is recommended to start dextrose containing IV fluids and 
continue basal insulin glargine to prevent rebound hyperglycemia. Insulin 
regimen should be r e-evaluated by provider as warranted.  
• Pre-meal blood glucose goal is 100 -150 mg/dl.

• Dextrose containing maintenance IV fluids are recommended for patients with 
prolonged NPO status receiving scheduled insulin.  
• If blood glucose is less than 100 mg/dl, nurse to hold basal  insulin and notify 
physician.

• Age > 70 years, eGFR <60mL/min, underweight, risk for hypoglycemia  
o Total Daily Insulin Dose = 0.2 units/kg  
▪ 0.1 units/kg/day basal glargine  
▪ 0.025 units/kg every 6 hours  nutritional regular insulin  
▪ Correctional Regular insulin every 6 hours  = Low (1 unit:50 mg/dL BG  
>150 mg/dL ) 
• Normal Body Weight (BMI 18.5 -25) 
o Total Daily Insulin Dose = 0.4 units/kg  
▪ 0.2 units/kg/day basal glargine  
▪ 0.05 units/kg every 6 hours  nutritional regular insulin  
▪ Correctional Regular insulin every 6 hours  = Low (1 unit:50 mg/dL BG  
>150 mg/dL ) 
• Overweight or Obese (BMI >25)  
o Total Daily Insulin Dose = 0.5 units/kg  
▪ 0.25 units/kg/day basal glargine  
▪ 0.06 units/kg every 6 hours nutritional regular insulin  
▪ Correctional Regular insulin every 6 hours = Medium (2 units:50 mg/dL 
BG >150 mg/dL ) 
 
Additional Considerations:  
• If patient is receiving bolus enteral tube feedings, daily nutritional insulin dose 
should be evenly divided and given prior to each feeding.  
• For cyclic enteral tube feeding or parenteral nutrition (e.g. nocturnal only), 
insulin dosing must be individualized and coincide with nutritional regimen.   
• Correctional regular insulin is given in addition to nutritional regular insulin dose.  
• If blood glucose is less than 100 mg/dl, nurse to hold nutritional/ basal  insulin and 
notify physician.   
• If nutrition is interrupted: nurse to notify physician, start dextrose 5%/0.45% 
NaCl infusion at twice the rate of nutrition order, hold scheduled regular insulin, 
give glargine and correctional regular insulin.

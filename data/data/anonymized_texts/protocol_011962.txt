PROTOCOL SUMMARY  
Study Title  Early Feasibility Assessment of the GORE® EXCLUDER® Thoracoabdominal 
Branch Endoprosthesis in the Treatment of Type IV Thoracoabdominal Aortic 
Aneurysms Involving the Visceral Branch Vessels  
Protocol Number  AAA 13 -02

Telephone: 800 -437-8181  
Study Design This is a non-randomized, multicenter study designed to assess the initial 
feasibility of the GORE® EXCLUDER® Thoracoabdominal Branch 
Endoprosthesis (TAMBE Device)  
Study Objective  Assess the initial safety of the TAMBE Device implantation procedure in the 
treatment of Aortic Aneurysms Involving the Visceral Branch Vessels  
Study Rationale This study is designed to provide evidence to support the use of the TAMBE 
Device as an option for endovascular treatment of patients with Type IV Thoracoabdominal Aortic Aneurysms . 
Study Endpoints  Primary endpoint:  
Procedural Safety - Absence of the following events through 30 days post-
procedure:  
• Death 
• Stroke  
• Myocardial Infarction  
• Bowel Ischemia 
• Paraplegia 
• Respiratory Failure  
• Renal Failure  
• Procedural Blood Loss ≥ 1000 mL  
Secondary endpoints:  
Technical Success - All of the following: 
• Successful access to the necessary arterial sites   
• Successful deployment of all required TAMBE Device components 
and any required accessory components  
• Patency of all required TAMBE Device components and any required accessory components on completion angiography  
• Absence of surgical conversion within 24 hours of initi ation of the 
procedure

Device integrity - Absence of the following events through one year of follow -
up: 
• Loss of functional patency in any branch component due to thrombus 
or mechanical failure of the branch components  
• Loss of functional patency in the main body component(s) due to thrombus or mechanical failure of the main body component(s)  
• Separation of the branch components from the main body component(s)  
• Separation of the main body component(s) from the accessory 
components ( Distal Bifurcated Component and / or contralateral limb 
components)  
 
Individual components of technical success 
Individual components of device integrity at one month, six months and 
one year follow -up 
Patency (Primary, Assisted Primary and Secondary)  
Absence of Type I and Type III endoleaks at one month follow -up

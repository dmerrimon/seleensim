Study Design : This will be a Phase 1 multicenter, dose - and schedule -finding, 
open -label, single -agent study of RX -3117 administered orally 
to subjects with advanced or metastatic solid tumors followed 
by a 2 -stage Phase 2 study design.  Subjects will be treated for 
up to 8 cycles of therapy.   In the Phase 1 portion of the study 
subjects with any advanced solid tumor malignancies will be 
enrolled. During the Phase 1 portion of the study, the maximum 
tolerated dose (MTD) or a recommended phase 2 dose (RP 2D) 
and schedule will be determined and the pharmacokinetics of 
RX-3117 characterized in eligible subjects.  In the Dose 
Expansion , subjects will be enrolled in 1 of 3 diagnosis groups: 
relapsed or refractory pancreatic, colorectal or advanced 
bladder canc ers.  In the Phase 2 portion, subjects will be 
enrolled in 1 of 2 diagnosis groups: relapsed or refractory 
pancreatic or advanced bladder cancers .  The Dose Expansion 
and Phase 2 portion  will use the dose and schedule identified i n 
the P hase 1 .  The Phase 2 portion will  follows a 2 -stage design. 
An interim analysis will be conducted when 10 response 
evaluable subjects in each tumor indication are enrolled and 
have had the opportunity to complete a minimum of 4 cycles of 
therapy or have discontinued therapy  due to progressive 
disease. In the second stage of the Phase 2, enrollment for a 
disease group will proceed if responses are observed within the 
first 10 response -evaluable subjects  enrolled in that disease 
group. Approximately 40 additional subjects will  be enrolled in 
each of the disease indications.  Subjects will be treated for up 
to 8 cycles of therapy.  
Sample Size:   Number of planned subjects is approximately 152 subjects (40 subjects in the 
Phase 1, depending upon the number of dose levels needed to identify the maximum tolerated 
Protocol Number:  RX-3117- P1-01 Product:  RX-3117

CONFIDENTIAL Page 5 of 108dose (MTD), 12 subjects in the Dose Expansion, 20 subjects in Stage 1 of the Phase 2 and 80 
subjects in Stage 2 of the Phase 2). 
Duration :  The study will consist of a screening period ( up to 14 days ; [up to 21 days for tumor 
imaging]), up to eight 28-day treatment cycles, an end- of-treatment visit, and a follow up visit 
approximately 30 days after the last dose of RX-3117 . Subject participation is anticipated to be 
approximately 10 months.   Additional cycles of therapy may be provided following discussions 
with the investigator, sponsor and medical monitor.  Subjects may remain on study treatment until 
the earliest of disease progression, an intolerable RX-3117-related toxicity, withdrawal of consent, 
pregnancy, substantial noncompliance with study procedures, principal investigator judgment that 
it is in the best interest of the subject to stop treatment, or study discontinuation.

Investigational Product Dosage and Administration:     
RX-3117 will be provided as 30 -mg, 100-mg, 200 -mg and 500 -mg capsules.   The capsules will 
consist of hydroxypropylme thyl cellulose and be packaged in a high -density polyethylene (HDPE) 
bottle with a child -resistant closure and an induction seal.  Subjects will take RX -3117 3 times per 
week  (i.e., preferably on a Monday, Wednesday and Friday), 5 times per week (i.e., for  5 
consecutive days followed by 2 days off), or daily for 7 days  for 3 weeks followe d by 1 week of 
rest, in each 28 -day cycle.    
Subjects will be fasting for 8 hours, the dose will be taken with 4-8 ounces of water, and a light 
meal will be permitted approximately 1 hour later.   During Cycle 1 subjects will be dispensed 
doses of RX -3117 each week and during cycles 2 to 8 doses will be dispensed at the start of 
each cycle.  
The starting dose will be 30 mg/day.  The d ose escalation will begin with an accelera ted design  
(Simon et al., 1997)  in single subjects.  After the occurrence of a single ≥ Grade 2 adverse event 
that is considered related to RX -3117, the study will transition to a standard 3 + 3 design using a 
modified Fibonacci sequence.  Doses will be rounded to accommodate available dose strengths .  
Additional doses and schedules may be recommended by the review committee  which includes 
investigators, medical monitor and sponsor . 
 
Control Group:   There will be no control group .

Safety Parameters :  Adverse events will be coded using the latest version of the Medical 
Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA, Version  15.1) and will be graded using the 
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE, Version  4.03).  The CTCAE will also 
be used to grade abnormalities  in vital signs , laboratory assessments that include serum 
chemistry, hematology, coagulation and urinalysis  and electrocardiogram s (Phase 1) . 
 
Statistical Considerations:    
Analysis Methods:  
In the Phase 1 portion and the Dose Expansion the statistical methods will be descriptive in 
nature.  Appropriate data analysis sets will be defined. The full -analysis set will include data from 
all subjects who receive  1 dose of study therapy; other data sets (responding and evaluable 
data sets) will be defined in a separate statistical analysis plan and will include data from subjects 
who have sufficient  baseline and on -study measurements to prov ide interpretable results for 
specific parameters of interest.  
Subject characteristics and study results will be described and summarized by RX-3117 dose 
level, schedule  and overall for the relevant analysis sets.  
Based on the full -analysis set, informat ion regarding study treatment administration, study drug 
compliance, and safety variables will be described and summarized.  Using data from the 
relevant evaluable data sets, RX-3117  plasma concentrations, pharmacokinetic parameters, and 
pharmacodynamic ma rkers will also be described and summarized.  Calculated pharmacokinetic 
parameters will be derived using non -compartmental methods.  
For endpoints relat ed to tumor assessment , analyses will be done based on the full -analysis, 
responding, or evaluable data sets, as appropriate.  Continuous and categorical variables will be 
summarized.  Changes from baseline in categorical variables and changes from baseline in 
continuous endpoints will be analyzed using appropriate methods.  Time -to-event endpoints will 
be summarized using Kaplan -Meier methods.  
The Phase 2 portion  of the study will follow a 2 -stage design  (Simon, 1989) . An interim analysis 
will be conducted when 1 0 response -evaluable subjects, treated with the recommended phase 2 
dose (RP2D) of RX -3117,  in ea ch tumor indication are enrolled and have had the  opport unity to 
complete a minimum of 4  cycles of therapy or have discontinued therapy due to progressive 
disease (PD). The critical value for evaluation of each tumor type to proceed to the second  stage 
of the Phase 2 is 2 in 1 0 subjects (20%) measured by a benefit in PFS (stable disease for at least 
4 months) or 1 subject with an objective clinical response  (partial or complete response)  
supported by acceptable safety and tolerability reviewed through the c onduct of the study by the 
investigators, medical monitor and sponsor .. In the second  stage of the Phase 2 objective clinical

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 9 of 108  response rate and PFS will be further evaluated, in 40 additional subjects within each of the 
disease groups that continue beyond the first stage.   
 
Sample Size Calculation : 
In this dose -escalation Phase 1 trial designed to determine an MTD for RX -3117, the sample size 
for the study is not based on a formal statistical hypothesis but will be determined based on 
observed number of f irst-cycle DLTs at each dose level  and schedule .  The planned accelerated 
design followed by a sequential 3+3 dose -escalation is consistent with usual oncologic paradigms 
for dose ranging  and schedule finding .  The intent is to limit the number of subjects  who are 
exposed to excessively toxic doses of a drug in a Phase 1 evaluation of an anticancer agent.  The 
trial will use  the standard National Cancer Institute (NCI) definition of MTD (starting dose 
associated with DLT in <  33.3% of subjects during the fi rst cycle of therapy).  The dose group 
size and dose -escalation rules establish a low probability of increasing the dose if the true rate of 
DLT is high while there is a high likelihood of escalating or proceeding to the next stage of the 
study if t he true underlying proportion of DLT is low.   Once the recommended phase 2 dose or 
MTD  and schedule  is identified  approximately 12 subjects will be treated in the Dose Expansion.  
The maximum number of subjects needed for Phase 2 is approximately 100 (50 pe r tumor 
indication ).  An estimated 20 subjects (10 per indication) will be enrolled in the first stage of the 
Phase 2 at the recommended dose from the Phase 1.  The Dose Expansion  subjects who have 
measurable disease at baseline and at least 1 post -baselin e response assessment may be 
considered as part of the first stage  of the Phase 2 .  
A formal statistical analysis plan will be developed and finalized before database lock.

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 18 of 108  2. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
2.1 Disease  
According to the latest statistics  (American Cancer Society, 2013), cancer causes 
around 7.6 million deaths worldwide each year.  Deaths from cancer a re projected to 
continue rising  to an estimated 21.4 million worldwide in 2030 (American Cancer 
Society, 2011).  
For patients presenting with  confined local -regional cancer , the development of systemic 
therapies as adjuvants to primary surgery or irradiation have substantially improved 
outcomes by d elaying recurrence of disease.  However, for patients who present with 
large primary tumors or me tastases or who develop recurrent metastatic disease, cancer 
becomes a life -threatening  disorder.  T herapy for patients with advanced cancer has 
focused on the sequential use of systemic treatments to impede the disease progression 
that leads to disabling symptoms and death .  Depending upon the tumor type, hormonal 
therapies, therapeutic monoclonal antibodies, or tyrosine kinase receptor inhibitors may 
be employed, and most commonly, cytotoxic chemotherapy in various sequences and  
combinations is administer ed.  
The development of newer agents in the past 2 decade s illustrates that it is still possible 
to improve outcomes by offering more efficacious, less toxic, and more convenient 
therapies to patients with cancer.  However, for patients with metastatic dis ease, the 
acquisition of drug resistance  results in less activity with each successive type of 
treatment, leading to a decrease in the quality and the duration of tumor response with 
each subsequent therapy .  Survival rate s for patient s with metastatic can cer remain  poor 
because tumor progression leads to death in the majority of patients .  Consequently, 
new therapies with alternative mechanisms of action are needed to offer additional 
treatment options for patients with advanced cancer.  
2.2 Cytidine Analogs in  the Therapy of Cancer  
Cytidine analogs have been widely used as antivirals and for the treatment of various 
types of cancer, both hematologic as well as solid tumors .  These agents  include 
cytarabine, 5 -azacytidine , 5-aza-2’deoxycytidine (decitabine)  and gemcitabine .  
Among these, gemcitabine is the most broadly use d anticancer agent.  Initially 
developed as an antiviral agent, gemcitabine (2’,2’ -difluoro -2’-deoxycytidine) is 
structurally similar to cytarabine  differing due to a fluorine substitution at po sition 2’ of

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 19 of 108  the furanose ring. Gemcitabine is a prodrug that requires cellular uptake and intracellular 
phosphorylation.  Within the cell, gemcitabine is phosphoryl ated to gemcitabine 
monophosphat e (dFdCMP) by deoxycytidine kinase which ultimately is conv erted to 
either the di - or triphosphate forms (gemcitabine diphosphate [dFdCDP] and 
gemcitabine triphosphate [dFdCTP];  Heinemann et al 1992) . 
Gemcitabine appears to have several intracellular targets.  Much of its anticancer 
properties, however, inv olve inhibition of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) synthesis (Gandhi 
and Plunkett 1990, Heinemann et al 1990, Hertel et al, 1990) .  Gemcitabine diphosphate 
is an inhibitor of DNA poly merase (Gandhi and Plunkett 1990)  and is also physically 
incorporated into DNA which can lead to termination of chain elongation (Huang et al 
1991) . The nonterminal positioning of dFdCTP in DNA preven ts detection and repair of 
that sequence by repair enzymes, which ultimately induces apoptosis (Gandhi and 
Plunkett 1990, Schy et al 1993) .  A metabolite of gemcitabine , which is most likely 
dFdCTP, can also incorporate into ribonucleic acid (RNA) (Ruiz  van Haperen et al 
1993) .  Other activities  associated with gemcitabine metabolites inc lude inhibition of 
cytidine triphosphate synthetase (CTP synthetase) and inhibition of deoxycytidylate 
deaminase (dCMP deaminase) by dFdCTP (Heinemann et al 1992) .  Gemcitabine can 
also affect topoisomerase I, which suggests that induction of topois omerase I mediated 
DNA break formation can contribute to the cytotoxic potential of this drug (Pourquier et al 
2002) . 
Initial Phase 2 studi es with gemcitabine as a single -agent (800 mg/m2 weekly for 3 
weeks) demonstrated a n overall  response rate (ORR) in chemotherapy -naive patients 
with metastatic adenocarcinoma of th e pancreas in the range of  6% to 11% (Carmichael 
et al 1996, Casper et al 1994) .  Despite this low objective response rate, clinical benefit 
was derived. In the Phase 2 study that  led to Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 
approval, clinical benefit was defined as improvement in pain, performance status , or 
weight without deterioration in any other factors (Rothenberg et al 1996) .  Clinical benefit 
was reported at 27% as compared to the objective response rate of 11% in 126 patients . 
In addi tion to its indication in metastatic pancreatic cancer (Burris, III et al 1997) , 
gemcitabine is used in combination treatment in non -small cell lung cancer (Sandler et al 
2000) , bladder cancer (von der Maase et al 2000) , breast cancer (Albain et al 2004) , 
ovarian cancer, mesothelioma, and head/neck cancers (Mini et al 2006) .

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 20 of 108  Despite the clinical value of gemcitabine, drug resistance is common, which may be due 
to the loss of transporters and kinases responsible for the first phosphorylation step.  
2.2.1  RX-3117 Structure  
RX-3117  is a small -molecule , cyclopentyl pyrimidyl nucleoside being developed by 
Rexahn Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  RX-3117 was synthesized as a  new oral antimetabolite 
with the p otential  to overcome gemcitabine resistance and offer a favorable 
pharmacologic profile.  Its chemical n ame is 4-amino -1-[(1S,4R,5S) -2-fluoro -4,5-
dihydroxy -3-(hydroxymethyl)cyclopent -2-en-1-yl]pyrimidin -2-one. The RX-3117  
monohydrate  drug substance is a white to yellow crystalline solid. The molecular weight 
is 257.22 daltons for the anhydrous form and 275.2 4 daltons  for the monohydrate  form. 
Its molecular formula is C10H12N3O4F•H 2O. 
2.2.2  Mechanism of Action and Nonclinical Pharmacology Studies  
The mechanism of action of RX-3117  has been investigated extensively. RX-3117  is an 
antimetabolite  that mimics the buildi ng blocks of DNA or ribonucleic acid ( RNA ).  
Antimetabolites are incorporated into DNA or RNA of cells , where they interfere with cell 
division. RX-3117  is activated by  uridine -cytidine kinase ( UCK ), and thus differs from  
gemcitabine, which is activated by  deoxycytidine kinase .  In addition, gemcitabine is 
inactivated by cytidine deaminas e at a fast rate, whereas RX-3117  is inactivated by 
cytidine deaminas e at a slow rate, thus allowing higher cellular concentration s of 
RX-3117  to enhance its anticancer act ivity.  
In vitro mechanism studies characterized the effects of RX-3117  on cell cycle, apoptosis, 
and further elucidate d its mode of action. Cell -cycle analysis by flow cytometry 
demonstrated that RX-3117  inhibited the cell cycle in G1 phase and also induc ed 
programmed cell death (apoptosis). The sensitivity  of RX -3117 to a variety of 
antimetabolite -resistant cell lines was tested, and it was  shown that RX-3117  was 
effective in wild -type cells as well as cells with acquired antimetabolite resistance. 
RX-3117 showed a variable resistance pattern in the cell lines tested, with a marked 
cross -resistance for the intrinsically gemcitabine -sensitive  A2780  and gemcitabine -
resistant AG6000  ovarian cancers, a moderate cross -resistance for  CCRF -CEM  acute 
lymphoblastic  T-cell leukemia  cells, and an enhanced sensitivity for gemcitabine -
resistant SW1573/G  non-small cell lung cancer cells.  The effect of RX-3117  on DNA and 
RNA was evaluated; the majority of cell lines investigated showed a concentration -

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 21 of 108  dependent inhibition  of DNA and RNA synthesis after exposure to RX-3117 , and 
RX-3117 showed inhibition of DNA synthesis more  than RNA synthesis in most cell 
lines. Moreover, RX-3117  inhibited the proliferation of a variety of cancer cell lines of 
different origin s, including bladder, bone, brain, breast, cervical, colon, liver, lung, 
muscle, ovary, pancreas, prostate, renal, and skin .  
Deoxyribonucleic acid methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) is responsible for the methylation of 
cytosine residues on newly synthesized DNA and also reg ulates and maintains 
methylation patterns. DNMT1 is often overexpressed in cancer cells, potentially resulting 
in aberrant methylation patterns  that can further cancer progression . It has been shown  
that RX-3117  mediate s the down -regulation of DNMT1 protei n expression with no effect 
on DNMT1 messenger RNA (mRNA) levels. While the basis for this activity of RX -3117 
on DNMT1 is unclear, t his additional action of RX -3117 could contribute to its an ti-
cancer activity.  
In vivo studies in nude mice evaluated the e ffects of RX-3117  on tumor 
proliferation/growth.  RX-3117  displayed antitumor activity in nude mice implanted with 
human tumors (COLO 205 colorectal adenocarcinoma, HCT116 colorectal carcinoma, 
MV-522 and A549 non -small cell lung carcinoma s, H460 large -cell lung carcinoma, H69 
small -cell lung cancer, Caki -1 renal carcinoma, CTG -0298 and Mia PaCa -2 pancreatic 
carcinoma s, and OVCAR3 ovarian carcinoma).  
The e fficacy of RX-3117  in subcutaneous xenograft models  (Colo-205, H460, H69 and 
CaSki models ), which are m oderately sensitive or resistant to gemcitabine, indicates  that 
RX-3117  may have the potential to be used for the treatment of tumors that do not 
respond to gemcitabine  or have become resistant to gemcitabine . 
In vitro cross -species myelotoxicity data show ed a myelotoxic effect on human and 
monkey bone marrow, a potential cytotoxic effect on mouse bone marrow, while non -
significant myelotoxicity was observed on canine and rat bone marrow . 
2.2.3  Nonclinical Safety Pharmacology Studies  
Safety pharmacology studies b y the oral route evaluated potential functional effects of 
RX-3117  on the cardiovascular system, respiratory system, and central nervous system. 
Effects on the central nervous system and the cardiovascular system were also 
evaluated as part of the 28 -day o ral repeated dose toxicity study in dogs.   In vitro,

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 22 of 108  RX-3117  displayed no human ether -a-go-go-related gene (hERG) potassium channel 
inhibition, no cardiac cytotoxicity, and had no effect on spontaneous beating in Cor.At ® 
pure embryonic stem cell derived ca rdiomyocytes.  In vivo, RX-3117  did not elicit any 
changes in blood pressure parameters, electrocardiography (ECG) parameters, or heart 
rate in dogs. RX-3117  had no significant effects on respiratory parameters in mice. In 
addition, RX-3117  had no effects on the central or autonomic nervous systems, or on 
peripheral motor and sensory systems in both mice and dogs. Finally, RX-3117  had no 
effects on electroencephalography activity following an intravenous ( IV) dose of 
100 mg/kg in monkeys.  
Further nonclinica l safety pharmacology information can be found in the RX-3117  
Investigator’s Brochure.  
2.2.4  Nonclinical Pharmacokinetic and Drug Metabolism Studies  
The pharmacokinetic properties of RX-3117  were investigated in mice, dogs, and 
monkeys in conjunction with toxici ty studies, as well as in separate pharmacokinetic 
studies.  
Pharmacokinetic studies indicate that RX-3117  is orally bioavailable in mice and dogs, in 
contrast to gemcitabine, which can only be  administered by the IV route only. RX-3117  is 
only poorly orally bioavailable in monkeys.   For all species investigated  in which the drug 
was orally bioavailable , RX-3117  displayed generally biphasic plasma profiles, with fast 
absorption  and a relatively fast initial distribution phase followed by a slower terminal 
phase.  Nonclinical pharmacokinetic parameters characterize a longer terminal 
elimination half -life (t ½) of RX-3117  than that of gemcitabine.  Following repeated 
administration, although plasma concentrations were detectable before  the last dose, the 
extent  of RX-3117  accumulation was minimal, with similar exposure parameters on the 
first and last days of administration.  No sex -related  differences of pharmacokinetic 
parameters were observed in any of the species tested.  
In CD -1 mice, RX-3117  displayed dose -dependent pharmacokinetics upon oral 
administration, with subproportional increase in exposure across dose levels of 100, 
300, and  1000  mg/kg.   The absorption of RX-3117  following oral administration was fast, 
resulting in an early time to maximum observed  plasma concentration ( Tmax) (0.75 -1 hour 
postdose).  Oral bioavailability was determined to be 74%.   The t½ values rang ed from 3 
to 10.3 hours .

oral administration, at th e dose ranges of 100 to 400 mg/kg and 30 to 300 mg/kg, 
respectively.  The absorption of RX-3117  was fast, resulting in an early Tmax (0.25 hour

cellulose capsules, with and witho ut Avicel PH -102 as excipient, did not significantly 
affect absorption of RX-3117  in female dogs relative to solution; although Tmax was 
slightly delayed (0.5 -1 hour postdose), relative exposure was the same.  Oral 
bioavailability was determined to be grea ter than 100%.   The t½ values rang ed from 3 to 
5.35 to 39 hours f ollowing oral administration and 3.25 to 4.7  hours following IV 
administration.  
The pharmacokinetic properties of RX-3117  were investigated in male C ynomolgus 
monkeys following a single bolus  IV administration dose of 2.5 mg/kg (not conducted 
under Good Laboratory Practice [non -GLP] study), or an IV  infusion for 6 minutes at 100 
to 300 mg/kg.  Monkeys were dosed via IV administration since RX-3117  display ed poor 
oral bioavailability (11%) in m onkeys.  Analysis of RX-3117  after IV infusion showed that 
increasing the dose from 2.5  to 35 mg/kg resulted in a supraproportional increase in 
exposure (greater than twice the expected value), suggesting nonlinear 
pharmacokinetics.   However, IV administra tion of RX-3117  between the dose range of 
35 to 300 mg/kg displayed linear kinetics.  RX-3117  was rapidly eliminated and showed 
moderate systemic clearance (CL) and volume of distribution (V z) after low - and 
moderate -dose IV administration.  The t½ values r anged from 1.28 to 11.25 hours.  
RX-3117  showed low permeability (<  5×10-6 cm/sec) in Caco -2 cells in both the A-B and 
B-A directions, and seems to be actively transported from the gastrointestinal tract into 
the blood, as well as from the blood into tissue s, possibly by human equilibrative 
nucleoside transporter (hENT).  
RX-3117  was tested for plasma protein binding in vitro, in mouse, rat, dog, monkey, and 
human plasma, at concentrations of 1 to 500 μM.  No measurable percentage of protein 
binding was obser ved in any of the species and concentrations examined.  
Early nonclinical pharmacokinetic and toxicokinetic investigations in dogs and monkeys 
characterized the plasma deaminated metabolite profile of RX-3117 .  Deamination of 
RX-3117  was faster in monkeys t han in dogs (T max= 2.5 and 5 hours).  Relative plasma 
exposure for the deaminated metabolite was higher in monkeys than in dogs (area under

concentration [AUC 0-last] of metabo lite and AUC from 0 to time extrapolated to infinity 
[AUC 0-∞] of RX-3117  were  56% and 30% in monkeys and dogs, respectively), and the 
observed elimination of the metabolite was slower than the elimination of the drug for 
both species.   Due to its longer t ½, the deaminated metabolite exposure following 
repeated administration equaled or exceeded RX-3117  exposure.  In monkeys, the ratio 
of AUC 0-last of metabolite to AUC 0-last of the parent drug  was 197% and 93%, respectively, 
after 5 daily IV administrations of 35  mg/kg RX-3117  and 4 doses of 150  mg/kg 
administered IV twice weekly.  In dogs, accumulation of the metabolite was less 
pronounced, with an increase of the exposure ratio to around 50% upon repeated 
administration.  
Interspecies comparison of the in vitro metabolism of RX-3117  in mouse, rat, dog, 
monkey, and human liver microsomes revealed that RX-3117  does not undergo 
cytochrome P450  (CYP) -mediated  metabolism in any of these species.  RX-3117  
metabolism was further investigated in human transformed cel l lines.  It was shown that 
RX-3117  was not phosphorylated by deoxycytidine kinase , but by UCK, into an active 
nucleotide form (mono -, bi-, or triphosphorylated RX-3117 ) and further incorporated into 
both RNA and DNA.   It was also shown that RX-3117  deamin ation was cytidine 
deaminas e -mediated, although its extent and rate are relatively very low.  
RX-3117  excretion was studied using 300 mg/kg of 3H-RX-3117  orally administered to 
mice.  RX-3117  excretion was relatively rapid with about 80% of the radioactivi ty 
eliminated during the first 24 hours.   Total recovery following 1 week was 94%, with 48% 
of dose radioactivity excreted in the urine and 46% in the feces.  
When tested in vitro in human liver microsomes, RX-3117  at 0.1  to 100 μM did not cause 
direct or time -dependent inhibition of any of the CYP enzyme s tested, namely CYP1A2, 
CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, or CYP3A4/5.  
When tested in vitro in human transporter -transfected polarized cell monolay er/vesicles, 
RX-3117  did not inhibit any of the transporters studied, namely organic anion transporter 
(OAT)1, OAT3, OCT1, OCT2, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, breast cancer resistance protein , 
P-glycoprotein , and bile salt export pump , at clinically relevant concentra tions (up to 
5 mM).  The effect of RX -3117 on CYP induction has not yet been evaluated .

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 25 of 108  2.2.5  Nonclinical Toxicology  Studies  
In mice, a single oral administration of RX-3117  at doses up to 1000 mg/kg did not 
induce toxicity signs on the day of treatment or during  a 14-day recovery period, at any 
of the doses tested.  Following daily oral administration of RX-3117  at 180/100 
mg/kg/day (male/female mice), 60 and 30  mg/kg/day (both male and female mice) for up 
to 28  days, mortality occurred at the high dose in male a nd female mice (180  and 100 
mg/kg, respectively) and in the mid -dose female mice (60  mg/kg) .  Consequently , dosing 
of the high -dose groups was terminated early.  Clinical signs were observed mainly in 
high-dose groups and included hunched posture, piloerec tion, decreased activity, 
lethargy, tremors, semi -closed eyes, and cold to touch.  Clinical signs mostly appeared 
just prior to the death or unscheduled sacrifice of the animals.  Marked reductions in 
body weight and food consumption were observed in high -dose groups and to a lesser 
extent in mid -dose groups with complete recovery at the end of the recovery period.  
Hematology investigations showed anemia, thrombocytosis, and leukopenia to be dose 
dependent, with partial recovery at the end of the recovery period. In clinical chemistry, 
reductions in glucose, and elevated globulin and creatine kinase levels were seen.  At 
necropsy, atrophy was seen in the thymus, lymph nodes, spleen, and bone marrow.  
Histopathologic examinations revealed  reductions in the n ormally present 
intracytoplasmic glycogen contents and single -cell necrosis in the liver , sporadic cases 
of vacuolation of the epithelium lining the kidney tubules, moderate inflammation of the 
intestinal mucosa associated with atrophy of the villi, and sp oradic presence of ulcers in 
the cecum and atrophy of the ovary corpora lutea.  Partial recovery was seen at the end 
of the recovery period.  The dose of 60 mg/kg/day was considered as the severely toxic 
dose (STD).  
In a non -GLP study in mice in which RX-3117 was given orally 3 times a week at 500, 
1000, and 1500 mg/kg  for a total of 5  administrations, a similar picture of toxicity 
appeared, yet at much higher doses as compared with the daily dosing regimen.  
Mortality occurred in the mid - and the high -dose  groups (1000 and 1500  mg/kg, 
respectively).  Clinical signs were observed in the mid - and high -dose groups and 
included piloerection, hunched posture and decreased activity.  Reduction in body 
weights and food consumption were mainly observed in high -dose  groups.  Hematologic 
changes included significant reductions in reticulocytes and anemia, thrombosis, and 
leukopenia to be dose dependent. The dose of 500 mg/kg/day was considered to be the 
maximum tolerated dose (MTD)  in this study.

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 26 of 108  In dogs, the main eff ects following a single oral administration of RX-3117  at doses up to 
300 mg/kg were bone marrow toxicity, consisting of significant changes in hematologic 
parameters, and reductions in weights of the thymus and male sexual glands in mid - 
(100 mg/kg) and h igh-dose (300 mg/kg) groups.  Following daily oral administration of 
RX-3117  for up to 28  days at doses of 1, 2.5, and 5 mg/kg , isolated episodes of emesis 
and liquid feces, along with reductions in body weight and food consumption, were seen 
in high -dose groups.  Hematologic changes were noted in high -dose groups, consisting 
of decreases in erythrocytes, hemoglobin, hematocrit, reticulocytes, and leucocytes and 
elevations in platelets, which were fully recoverable by the end of the recovery period. At 
necropsy, thymus weights were reduced in high -dose groups and mid -dose female dogs, 
with complete recovery in 3 of 4 animals.  Thymus atrophy was noted at histopathologic 
examinations in 1 male dog given the high dose.  The changes seen in the thymus were 
potentially secondary, related to stress -associated with the administration of high dose.  
No changes were observed in weights or histopathology of male sexual glands.   The 
dose of 5  mg/kg/day was determined as the highest nonseverely toxic dose (HNSTD) 
while t he dose of 2.5 mg/kg/day was determined as the no -observed -adverse -effect level 
(NOAEL).  
In a non -GLP study in dogs in which RX-3117  was given orally at doses of 15 and 
30 mg/kg 3  times per week for a total of 6  administrations, abnormal feces were 
observe d in the high -dose group but no significant reductions in body weight and food 
consumption were seen in either dose group.  Hematologic changes included reductions 
in neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, and basophils in both dose groups with full 
recovery  5 days after the last dose.  Overall, the toxicity profile of RX-3117  in this study 
was similar to that observed during the 28 -day repeated dose toxicity study, yet toxic 
effects were observed at higher doses in the thrice -weekly dosing regimen.  The dose  of 
30 mg/kg/day was considered to be the MTD in this study.  
Intravenous administration of high doses of RX-3117  in dogs and monkeys was 
associated with marked central nervous system toxicity, which was not observed in any 
of the tested species following d osing by the oral route.   In dogs, a single IV dose of 400 
mg/kg induced tremors of the head and convulsions 10 hours postdose.  No such signs 
were noted in dogs following a single oral administration of RX-3117  at up to 300 mg/kg, 
or after 28 -days repeate d oral administration at doses up to 5 mg/kg/day.   In monkeys, a 
single IV dose of 300 mg/kg induced convulsions, tremors, and behavioral disturbances

while a single IV dose of 200 mg/kg or repeated twice weekly doses of 150 mg/kg (given 
4 times) were associated with dilated pupils, ataxia, and tremors.  Daily IV doses of 
35 mg/kg in monkeys (given for 5  consecutive days) were not associated with any signs 
of central n ervous system toxicity.  
RX-3117  was tested in a dedicated electroencephalography study in monkeys, in order 
to set safe dose s and exposure levels based on electroencephalography measurements.  
Following a single IV dose of 100  mg/kg, no effects were noted on 
electroencephalographic activity and no clinical or electrophysiologic findings suggesting 
proconvulsant or seizure liability were observed.  Exposure levels measured at this safe 
dose of 100 mg/kg IV were: 200428 ng/mL and 206670 ng/mL (mean maximum 
observed plasma concentration measured [C max] in male and female monkeys, 
respectively) and 119 ,811 ng•hr/mL and 13 439 ng •hr/mL (mean AUC from the time of 
dosing to the last measurable concentration , [AUC 0-t] in male and female monkeys, 
respectively).  
RX-3117 was not mutagenic in the Ames in vitro reverse mutation assay using 5  strains 
of bacteria.  However, RX-3117  was mutagenic to mammalian cells, when tested in the 
mouse lymphoma cell assay.  
No studies on reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity with RX-3117 have been 
performed.  
2.2.6  Exploratory Clinical Stud y 
RX-3117  was evaluated in an exploratory pharmacokinetic study of a single oral dose 
(50 or 100  mg) or a single IV dose (20 mg) of RX-3117 performed at 2 centers  in 
Hungary.  Subjects  had advanced solid tu mor and had not received any chemotherapy 
for 2 weeks prior to receiving th e study drug.  
The primary study objective was to determine the absolute oral bioavailability of 
RX-3117  from a single dose administered to subjects  with solid tumors.  The secondary  
objectives were to evaluate the safety and tolerability of a single dose of RX-3117  
administered either orally or IV and to evaluate dose proportionality of 2  single dose 
levels of RX-3117  administered orally.

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 28 of 108  Nine subject s (3 subjects  in each group  [50 mg oral dose, 100 mg oral dose, or 20 mg IV 
dose] ) were administered study drug  in this first -in-human, sub -therapeutic , single -dose 
study.  Study drug was administered either orally or IV to the subject in the clinical 
setting.  The in-patient observation  period was from Study Day 1 through Study Day 3.  
After administering the appropriate single dose of RX-3117 , blood samples were 
collected at specific times throughout a 48 -hour period.  A safety follow -up assessment 
was performed on Study Day 7.  No effi cacy or pharmacodynamic endpoints were 
assessed.  Pharmacokinetic and safety results were assessed. Information on 
concomitant medications was collected . 
No subject s were withdrawn from the study for any reason and all subject s completed 
the study.  All 9 subjects  were included in the safety and pharmacokinetic analyses . 
Following oral administration, RX-3117  exposure parameters for the 50 -mg and 100 -mg 
dose levels were not markedly different.  For the respective 50- and 100 -mg doses, the 
mean  Tmax was 2.16  and 2.49 hours , the mean C max was 303 ng/mL and 311 ng/mL , the 
mean AUC 0-∞ was 2440  ng•h/mL and 2986 ng •h/mL , and mean t½ values were 14 hours 
and 21 hours (with the concentration -time profiles after the peak showing an initial 
distribution phase followed by a slower terminal elimination phase ).  After a single IV 
bolus admin istration of 20 mg RX-3117 , plasma concentrations declined rapidly, 
resulting in a multiphasic profile with a rapid initial decline followed by a slow terminal 
elimination phase, with mean t ½ of 21 hours.   The calculated absolute oral bioavailability 
(F), based on non -crossover data, was 55.7% for the 50 -mg dose and 33.4% for the 
100-mg dose.   The mean V z calculated was 345 L.  
No adverse events, treatment -emergent adverse events, deaths, or other serious 
adverse events were reported.  No significant findin gs resulted from assessments of 
clinical laboratory test results, vital sign measurements, ECG, or physical examination 
findings.  No safety issues (including cardiac toxicity) were reported although it should 
be noted that data w ere only collected on Days 1 through 3 and Day 7 after the study 
drug administration . 
2.3 Selection of Starting Dose  
The starting dosage of RX-3117  selected for this study is 30  mg/day  administered in 
repeated 4 -week cycles comprising administration of the drug 3 time s per weekly for 
3 weeks with a 1 -week hiatus.  This starting dosage selection is based on the results of

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 29 of 108  28-day toxicology studies in both mice and dogs and is in compliance with the 
International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) S9 guideline.  
Repeated oral dose toxicity  studies with RX-3117  were conducted up to 28 days in mice 
and dogs followed by recovery periods of up to 28 days.  Dosages evaluated in mice 
were 180/100  mg/kg/day (male/female mice), 60  mg/kg/day and 30  mg/kg/day (both 
male and female mice), which were c onverted into human equivalent doses (HED) of 
540/300 mg/m2, 180 mg/m2, and 90 mg/m2, respectively.  Dosages evaluated in dogs 
were 1, 2.5, and 5 mg/kg/day with HED s of 20 mg/m2, 50 mg/m2, and 100  mg/m2, 
respectively.  
Using  data from rodents, the initial s tarting dose in humans is calculated as 1/10 of the 
HED  that produces severe toxicity in 10% of the animals (STD 10).  The STD 10 in mice 
was determined to be 60 mg/kg, which is converted to an HED of 180 mg/m2; with 
application of the 1/10 safety factor, the starting dose in humans would  be 18  mg/m2.  
For an adult (60  kg) with an average body surface area of 1.6 m2, this calculates to  a 
dose of 28.8 mg/ subject .  
Using  data from nonrodents, the initial starting dose is calculated as 1/6 of the human 
equivalen t of the HNSTD.   In the case of RX-3117 , the HED is calculated according to 
body surface comparison as described by Senderowicz (2010) .  Thus, the STD 10 of 5 
mg/kg in dogs is conve rted to a HED of 100  mg/m2; with application of the 1/6 safety 
factor, the starting dose based on this species is 16.7  mg/m2.  For an adult (60  kg) with 
an average body surface area of 1.6 m2, this calculates to  a dose of 26.7  mg/subject . 
Therefore, the hu man starting doses of RX-3117  calculated from 28 -day toxicity studies 
in mice and dogs are comparable, at 28.8 or 26.7 mg/ subject , respectively.  Thus an 
appropriate starting dose is 30 mg.  
Based on preliminary xenograft modeling in the most sensitive tumo r cell line to date, 
renal cell (Caki -1), 3 times/week dosing was effective (see RX-3117 Investigator’s 
Brochure ).  Considering  toxicity data from nude mice and beagle dogs, clinical 
administration of repeated therapy cycles comprising drug administration 3 times per 
week weekly for 3  weeks with a 1-week hiatus appears appropriate to induce tumor cell 
killing but permit recovery from myelosu ppression .  However, there are other studies in 
dogs in which once daily dosing for 5  days was given.  Additional stud ies may suggest 
daily dosing for 5 days with a 2 -day hiatus over a 2 -week period with a 2 -week period of

the study design may be amended to evaluate alternate treatm ent schedule s.  
2.4 Dosing Frequency Rationale  
Three times per week dosing up to 4500 mg was originally planned for this study.  
However, following treatment with  1000  to 2000 mg, RX-3117 levels in the blood  began 
to plateau .  Based upon this finding more freq uent dosing at lower doses is 
recommended.  
To predict the potential exposures resulting from variable doses and schedules, a 
simulated population PK model was created and then validated with the  clinical 
pharmacokinetic data collected in the current study at 3 times per week dosing  
administration (doses 30 to 2 000 mg 3 times per week ). At each dose level, 500 
simulated profiles were generated using the RX -3117 population PK model. At most 
dose levels, the clinically measured concentration profiles were gene rally within the 
middle 90% of the simulated profiles and often were close to the median concentration 
line, thereby providing a positive visual predictive check of the model. Using the 
population PK model, potential RX -3117 plasma exposures were predicted  for proposed 
5 and 7 times per  week dosing schedules. In the revised dosing schedule  (Table 2) , the 
total weekly doses, total weekly exposures (AUCs), and total cycle doses are initially 
planned not to exceed doses administered previously on a 3 times per  week dosing 
schedule  (Table 1) .  
3. EXPERIMENTAL PLAN  
3.1 Study Design  
This is a Phase 1, multicenter, open -label , single -agent study of RX-3117  administered 
orally to subjects with advanced or metastatic solid tumors , with a dose expansion at the 
MTD or recomme nded Phase 2 dose  and schedule  followed by a 2 -stage (Simon, 1989)  
Phase 2 study design  in subjects with relapse/refractory pancreatic cancer or advanced  
bladder cancer .  The study consists of a screening period ( up to 14 days ; up to 21 days 
for tumor ima ging assessments ), repeated 28-day treatment cycles  for up to 8 cycles , an 
end-of-treatment visit, and a follow -up visit approximately 30 days after the last dose of 
RX-3117.   Additional cycles of therapy may be provided following discussions with the 
investigator, sponsor and medical monitor.

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 31 of 108  The drug will be administered orally in repeated 4 -week cycles comprising administration 
of the drug 3  times per weekly , 5 times per week, or daily (e.g., 7 days  per week)  for 
3 weeks with a 1 -week hiatus.  These dosing regimen s and schedules are  supported by 
non-clinical toxicology studies performed in the mouse and dog , clinical pharmacokinetic 
data from the current study and pharmacokinetic simulation data .  
In the Phase 1, t he initial starting dose level of RX-3117 will be 30 mg/day.  The dose 
escalation will begin with an accelerated design in single subjects  (Simon et al., 1997) .  
After the occurrence in Cycle 1 of a single ≥ Grade 2 adverse event that is considered 
related to RX -3117, the study will transition t o a standard 3 + 3 design using a modified 
Fibonacci sequence (see Section 6.2 for details).   
In the Phase 1 portion of the study subjects with advanced solid tumor malignancies will 
be enrolled.  During the Phase 1 portion of the study, the maximum toler ated dose 
(MTD) or a recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) and schedule will be determined and 
the pharmacokinetics of RX -3117 characterized in eligible subjects.  Following 
determination of the MTD or RP2D dose a Phase 1 Dose Expansion will occur.  In the 
Dose Expansion , subjects will be enrolled in 1 of 3 diagnosis groups: relapsed or 
refractory pancreatic, colorectal or advanced  bladder cancers .  In the Phase 2 portion, 
subjects will be enrolled in 1 of 2 diagnosis groups: relapsed or refractory pancreatic or  
bladder cancers .  The Phase 2 part of the study will follow a 2 -stage design  (Simon, 
1989) .  An interim analysis will be conducted when 10 response evaluable subjects in 
each tumor indication are enrolled and have had the opportunity to complete a minimum  
of 4 cycles of therapy or have discontinued therapy due to progressive disease.   In the 
second stage, efficacy  will be further evaluated in the disease groups that continue 
beyond the first stage.   
Subjects will receive up to 8 cycles of RX -3117  or until disease progression (per RECIST 
ver 1.1 see Appendix C), an intolerable RX-3117 related adverse event, withdrawal of 
consent, pregnancy, substantial noncompliance, or if the principal investigator feels it is 
in the best interest of the subject to stop tr eatment.   After 8 cycles of therapy if in the 
opinion of the investigator , a subject  is receiving benefit, additional cycles of RX -3117 
may be administered following discussions with the s ponsor  and medical monitor .

5. SUBJECT ENROLLMENT  
5.1 Subject  Recruitment  
Subject s will be enrolled  from the cancer population s being followed at the 
investigational sites.  The site personnel  will discuss the possibility of participation 
directly with subject s being seen in the center who may be appropriate candidates for 
the study .  A description of the protocol will be posted on the www.clinicaltrials.gov 
website .   
5.2 Subject Re gistration , Enrollment and Treatment Assignment  
Before subjects may be entered into the study, the sponsor requires a copy of the site’s 
written institutional review board approval of the protocol, informed consent form, and all 
other subject information a nd/or recruitment material, if applicable (see Section 12.3).   
All subjects must personally sign and date the consent form before study specific 
procedures are performed  during the screening period .  After a subject  has completed 
the necessary screening a ssessments , any questions regarding the eligibility of a 
subject  should be discussed with the study sponsor before enrollment of the subject  into 
the study.  
The study sponsor or its designee  will assign each subject  a unique subject  identification 
number ( a 2-digit site number followed by a 3 -digit subject  number) .  The subject  
number must be used for subject  identification on all study -related documents ( e.g., 
electronic case report forms [ eCRFs], clinic notes, laboratory samples, CT scans, PET 
scans, MRIs , etc) . In order to obtain a subject  number, the site must provide completed 
eligibility documents  to the study sponsor or designee.  In order for the subject  to begin

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 37 of 108  study treatment, the study sponsor or designee  will provide confirmation of eligibility by 
either fax or e -mail to the site .  Of note, subjects may be rescreened only once for 
laboratory values not meeting the criteria for study eligibility.   A subject will be  enrolled 
when the treatment dose has been  assigned .   
5.3 Subject Enrollment and Treatm ent Assignment  
The site will provide documentation showing that the subject meets the eligibility 
requirements .  Following a review of supporting documentation , by the s ponsor or its 
designee , the site will receive the treatment assignment , dosing schedule  and a 
confirmation of enrollment .  Ideally subjects will be dose d within 3 days of enrollment.  
5.4 Subject Replacement  
In the Phase 1 , including the Dose Expansion , subjects who are enrolled but not treated 
and subjects who discontinue treatment before compl etion of C ycle 1 for reasons other 
than the occurrence of a DLT may  be replaced.   Any replacement subject  will be 
enrolled into the same dosing  level and schedule  as that for the subject  who withdrew . 
In the Phase 2 portion, non -evaluable subjects will be replaced.  
6. TREATMENT PROCEDURES  
The only investigational product in this study is RX -3117.  For details on the study drug 
description, storage and handling see Section 11.  
6.1 Study  Drug Administration  
6.1.1  Dosing Schedule  
RX-3117  will be administered on a cyclical b asis.  A cycle is defined as the period 
elapsing from the first day of RX-3117  administration through Day  28 of the cycle or to 
the recovery from any adverse events sufficient that a new cycle can be administered 
(e.g., on Day 36 or Day 43), whichever occu rs later.  Once a new cycle is initiated, the  
prior cycle is considered to be completed .  
In each 28 -day cycle, RX -3117  will be taken by the study subjects  3 times per week 
(e.g., Monday, Wednesday, Friday) , 5 times per week ( i.e., for 5 consecutive days 
followed by 2 days off) or daily (e.g ., 7 days per week)  for 3 successive weeks followed 
by  1-week of washout.   Study drug should be taken at approximately the same time

19 February  2016  Amendment 0 4 
 
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 38 of 108  each day  (e.g., at ~8 AM on each planned day of dosing) .  Ideally, doses should be 
taken at ~ 48-hour intervals , for 3 times per week, or ~24- hour intervals , for 5 and 7 
times per week  dosing schedule .  While it is realized that variations in dosing schedule 
may occur in the outpatient setting, the prescribed regimen should be followed as closely 
as possible, especially in the clinic.  
At specified clinic visits  in Cycle 1 , the study drug will be administered in the clinic with 
dosing appropriately timed relative to blood sampling for RX-3117  pharmacokinetics.  As 
detailed in Section  7, clinic staff should record RX -3117 administration information,  
including the exact time each dose of RX-3117 is administered in the clinic or hospital.  
6.1.2  Dose Administration  
At each RX -3117 dose administration, the capsule  types and numbers corresponding to 
the appropriate dose of RX -3117 are to be swallowed whole with 100 to 200 mL (~ 4 to 
8 ounces) of water.  Subjects should be instructed not to bite or chew on the capsules .  
In case of breakage of the capsules  in the oral cavity, additional water should be ta ken 
as a rinse.  
Subjects will be  instructed to refrain from eating for 8 hours before each dose is 
administered .  Subjects may eat  1 hour after dose administration.  
6.2 Dose Escalation and Stopping Rules  
Dose escalation in this study will begin with an acce lerated design involving single 
subjects (Simon et al., 1997) until the occurrence of any adverse event of Grade  2 that 
is considered related to RX -3117.  Thereafter, the dose escalation will transition to a 
standard 3  + 3 design using a modified Fibonac ci sequence. D ose escalation will 
proceed according to the specified dose escalation schem e described in  Tables 1 and 2 .  
The doses will be administered from the least number of capsules available at the time 
of dosing.

In the revised dosing schedule, the total weekly doses , total weekl y exposures (AUCs),  
and total cycle doses are initially planned  (Table 2, groups 10 through 15) not to exceed 
doses administered previously on a weekly dosing schedule.  Dose groups 16 through 
19, if administered, will use all available safety data to make dose escalation decisions 
between the Sponsor, principal investigators and medical monitor.  Subjects receiving 
doses that are similar based upon total weekly dosing, despite differing schedules, may 
be enrolled at the same time.

In the accelerated portion, dose -escalation decisions will be made after a single subject 
has been treated for 1 cycle of therapy (i.e., 3  weeks of treatment followed by  1 week 
of rest) and doses will be escalated following review of data from Cycle 1 by the 
investigators, medical monitor and sponsor .  The accelerated design  schedule will 
continue until there is an adverse event of a  Grade 2 in Cycle 1 that the investigator 
considers related to RX-3117.  After the occurrence of such an adverse event in the first 
subject at that dose level, dose escalation will proceed according to the standard 3+3 
design, with 2 to 5 additional subjects to be treated at the same dose level and schedule 
(depending upon the toxicities observed).  
If a DLT occurs at one dose and dosing schedule (i.e., 5 or 7 times per week), that dose 
and schedule will follow the rules described below for enrolling additional subjects.  
Once the standard 3+3 dose escalation is initiated, th e following dose -escalation rules 
will be employed:  
 If 0 of the first 3 subjects experience DLT during the first 4 weeks of treatment, then 
the dose and schedule will be escalated to the next higher dose group  in 
3 subsequent subjects.  
 If 1 of the first 3 subjects experiences DLT at the current dose and schedule during 
the first 4 weeks of treatment, then 3 more subjects will be accrued at the same dose 
level and schedule .  
 If 0 of the 3  additional subjects experience DLT during the first 4 weeks of treatme nt, 
then the dose and schedule will be escalated to the next dose group  level in 3 
subsequent subjects.  
 If  1 of the 3  additional subjects in a dose group  experiences DLT in the first 4 
weeks of treatment, the MTD has been exceeded and 3  more subjects wil l be treated 
at the next lower dose group  (if only 3  subjects were previously treated at that prior 
dose group ).

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 41 of 108   If  2 of 3 or  2 of 6 subjects experience DLT during the first 4 weeks of treatment, 
then the MTD has been exceeded and 3  more subjects will be treated at the next 
lower dose group  (if only 3  subjects were previously treated at that prior dose level).  
 Each group of 3  subjects within a dose group  must be observed for a minimum 
period of 4  weeks without DLT before subsequent subjects are enrolle d at the next 
higher dose level.  
 Escalation to the next dose group  of the study can occur upon review of the safety 
data from all ongoing and previous subjects and with the concurrence of the study 
sponsor  and the principal investigators.  
In the event th at attribution of causality , of potential DLTs , to study drug may be 
equivocal, discussions with the investigators, medical monitor and sponsor  will occur 
and additional subjects may be enrolled at that dose level  and schedule .  Reviews will 
be conducted b y the investigators, medical monitor and sponsor  of all available  safety 
data on an ongoing basis throughout the study.  The study sponsor or its designee will 
notify the sites when enrollment into a dose level and schedule is complete and when 
the next do se level and schedule is open to enrollment.  
6.3 Determination of MTD and Recommended Phase 2 Starting Dose  
The establishment of the MTD or recommended Phase 2 dose will be based on a review 
of the overall safety data by the investigators, medical monitor and  sponsor .  The MTD is 
the highest dose level and schedule below the dose and schedule associated with first -
cycle DLT s in < 33.3% of subject s.  Once the MTD is initially established, additional 
subjects (up to 12 subjects  with metastatic pancreatic cancer or advanced  bladder 
cancer ) may be enrolled to receive RX-3117 at the MTD or a lower dose and 
corresponding schedule if further confirmation of the safety profile appears warranted.  
Selection of a recommended Phase 2 starting dose from within the te sted dose range 
and schedules will be based on evaluation of short - and long -term safety information but 
also considering  findings regarding compliance, pharmacokinetic s, pharmacodynamic s 
and antitumor activity , if applicable .  The review committee may rec ommend that a 
previous dose level and schedule be considered the MTD or recommended Phase 2 
dose or that another dose level and schedule between the highest previously tolerated 
dose level and schedule, and the dose level and schedule exceeding the MTD be tested 
in additional subjects.  While the Phase 2 is ongoing the review committee may

rest. 
6.4 Definitions of Dose -Limiting Toxicity  
Reference should be made to the CTCAE, Versio n 4.03 for grading of the severity of 
adverse events and laboratory abnormalities.  A DLT  will be defined as any of the 
following adverse event s that is considered by the investigator as related to RX-3117 : 
 Grade 4 neutropenia (ANC <  0.5 x 109/L)  
 Grade  3 neutropenia (ANC <  1.0 x 109/L) with fever greater than 38.5°C 
(101.3°F)  
 Grade 4 thrombocytopenia (platelet count <  25 x 109/L) 
 Grade  2 vomiting despite maximal oral antiemetic therapy, or a requirement for 
IV antiemetics to control RX-3117 -related nau sea and vomiting  
 Other Grade  3 adverse events or laboratory abnormalities  
6.5 Delayed, Missed  and Vomited Doses  
Subjects receiving RX -3117 at 3 times per week who have a delay in the administration 
of a dose of RX-3117  of < 12 hours should take the planned d ose as soon as possible 
after the intended time of administration.  For subjects who have a delay in 
administration of RX-3117  of  12 hours, the dose should not be taken.  RX-3117 
administration may continue but the missed dose should not be made up and t he 
planned timing of subsequent RX-3117  dosing should not be altered.  
Subjects receiving RX -3117 at 5 times per week who have a delay in the administration 
of a dose of RX-3117  of ≤ 8 hours should take the planned dose as soon as possible 
after the intende d time of administration.  For subjects who have a delay in 
administration of RX-3117  of  8 hours, the dose should not be taken.  RX-3117 
administration may continue but the missed dose should not be made up and the 
planned timing of subsequent RX-3117  dosing should not be altered.  
Subjects receiving RX -3117 daily (e.g., 7 times per week ) who have a delay in the 
administration of a dose of RX-3117  of ≤ 8 hours should take the planned dose as soon

administration of RX-3117  of  8 hours, the dose should not be taken.  RX-3117 
administration may continue but the misse d dose should not be made up and the 
planned timing of subsequent RX-3117  dosing should not be altered.  
Vomited doses should not be retaken . 
6.6 Dosage Modifications  
Whenever possible, dose and scheduling modifications  should be discussed between 
the investiga tor and the  sponsor prior to implementation.  The appropriate clinic staff 
should dispense the study drug for the new dose level or schedule and instruct the 
subject/caregiver about the change in dose level  or schedule .  
6.6.1  Dose Modifications During a Cycle  
If a subject experiences a RX-3117 -related DLT (as defined in Section 6.4) and requires 
a dose and/or frequency  reduction, RX-3117  administration should be interrupted, as 
necessary, until the adverse event resolves or stabilizes to an acceptable degree 
(generally to the pretreatment severity grade).  If appropriate, more frequent laboratory 
monitoring may be instituted  until abnormalities have recovered  to the pretreatment 
severities .  Thereafter, RX-3117  may be reinstituted, but the dose  and/or freq uency  of 
RX-3117  for the remainder of that cycle should be reduced by 1 dose level or as directed 
by the Sponsor .  Successive adjustments to  progressively lower dose levels can be 
made.   If the subject cannot tolerate RX-3117  at Dose  Level  1 (30 mg/dose) then th e 
subject should be discontinued from RX-3117  therapy.  If neces sary, the subject  should 
be instructed to return to the clinic to receive RX-3117 of the appropriate strength( s) for 
the reduced dose level.  Doses during missed days of treatment should not b e made up 
(e.g., if a subject  experiences an RX-3117 -related adverse event , after 1 week of  
treatment , and the event lasts for 1 week , the missed doses during week 2 should be 
omitted and the new reduced dose level should be administered only for the remai ning 
doses  so that the total planned cycle  duration remains 28 days) .  
6.6.2  Dose Modifications at the Beginning of the Next Cycle  
A new cycle of RX -3117 treatment may begin no earlier than  Day 28 but should be 
delayed, as necessary, until adverse events or labo ratory abnormalities have returned to 
baseline levels .  If adverse event s or laboratory abnormalities are not resolved to

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 44 of 108  baseline, week ly delays in initiating the new cycle of t reatment should be instituted.  
Once all toxicities have returned to baseline,  the next cycle of therapy can be initiated .  
Subject s experiencing any of the DLTs described in Section 6.4 in the current cycle of 
therapy should have the dose  and/or frequency  in the next cycle of therapy reduced by 1 
dose level  and/or frequency  (see Table 1 and Table 2) or as directed by the Sponsor .  
Subjects who required an intra -cycle dose and/or frequency  reduction , during the current 
cycle  of therapy , should have the dose  and/or frequency  in the next cycle of therapy 
administered at no higher than the highest dose and/or frequency  tolerated in the current 
cycle .  Successive inter-cycle adjustments to progressively lower dose levels and/or 
frequenc ies can be made.   If the subject cannot tolerate RX-3117  at Dose  Level  1 
(30 mg/dose) then the subject s hould be discontinued from RX-3117  therapy.  
Subjects receiving a lower dose and/or frequency  but who the principal investigator feels 
is benefiting from treatment, may after discussions with the Sponsor, receive a higher 
dose and at more frequent dosing, for which there is already safety data.  
6.6.3  Dose Re -Escalation  
After a dose  and/or frequency  is reduced, the dose and/or frequency  need not be re -
escalated, even if there is minimal or no toxicity with the reduced dose  and/or frequency .  
However, if the subjec t tolerates a reduced dose and/or frequency  of RX-3117  for 
≥ 4 weeks then the RX-3117  dose may be increased to the next higher dose level  and/or 
frequency , at the discretion of the investigator.  Such re -escalation may be particularly 
warranted if further evaluation reveals that the adverse event that led to the dose and/or 
frequency  reduction was not RX-3117 -related.  Successive adjustments to progressively 
higher dose and/or frequency  levels can be made at 4 -week intervals  but the dose 
and/or frequency  must not exceed the highest  dose  and/or frequency  level for which 
there is already Cycle 1 safety data .  
6.7 Discontinuation of Study Treatment  
All study participants may receive study treatment for up to 8 cycles.  Therapy b eyond 
8 cycles may be considered  following discussions among the sponsor, investigator and 
medical monitor. However:  
 Any subject has the right to withdraw from study treatment or study follow -up at any 
time.

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 45 of 108   Any subject who has objective evidence of cancer progression should be withdrawn 
from study treatment.  
 Any subject who cannot tolerate RX -3117 at the 30 -mg dose level despite 
appropriate supportive care should be withdrawn from study treatment.  
 Any subject whose medical condition substantially changes after entering the study 
should be ca refully evaluated by the investigator in consultation with the sponsor; 
such subjects should be withdrawn from study treatment if continuing would place 
them at risk.  
 Any subject who becomes pregnant or begins breastfeeding should be withdrawn 
from study t reatment.  
 Any subject who becomes significantly noncompliant with study drug administration, 
study procedures, or study requirements should be withdrawn from study treatment 
in circumstances that increase risk or substantially compromise the interpretation  of 
study results.  
 The investigator, in consultation with the sponsor, may withdraw any subject from the 
study treatment, if, in the investigator’s opinion, it is not in the subject’s best interest 
to continue.  
 The sponsor, relevant regulatory agencies, o r the institutional review board  may 
request discontinuation of the study at any time.  
The date the subject is withdrawn from study treatment or from the study and the reason 
for discontinuation will be recorded in the subject’s medical record and on the 
appropriate eCRF.  
When a subject is withdrawn from study treatment or is permanently removed from study 
treatment (regardless of the reason), all of the evaluations required at the end -of-
treatment visit should be performed and any additional evaluations sh ould be completed 
that may be necessary to ensure that the subject is free of untoward effects.  The 
subject should be encouraged to seek appropriate follow up for any continuing health 
problems.

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 46 of 108  Subjects who discontinue study treatment may still continue on study follow -up.  Thus, 
all subjects receiving study drug will be followed during the post treatment follow -up 
assessments unless the subject withdraws consent for such follow -up. 
6.8 Concomitant and Supportive Therapy  
To the extent possible, administration  of any prescription or over -the-counter drug 
products other than study medication should be minimized during the study period. 
Subjects should be discouraged from use of street drugs, herbal remedies, self -
prescribed drugs, tobacco products, or excessive alcohol at any time during the clinical 
study.  
If considered necessary for the subject’s well -being, drugs for concomitant medical 
conditions or for symptom management may be given at the discretion of the 
investigator.  The decision to authorize the use o f any drug other than study drug should 
take into account subject safety, the medical need, the potential for drug interactions, the 
possibility for masking symptoms of a more significant underlying event, and whether 
use of the drug will compromise the ou tcome or integrity of the study  
Subjects should be instructed about the importance of the need to inform the clinic staff 
of the use of any drugs or remedies (whether prescribed, over -the-counter, or illicit) 
before and during the course of the study.  Any concomitant drugs taken by a subject 
during the course of the study and the reason for use should be recorded on the 
electronic case report forms ( eCRFs ). 
6.8.1  Analgesics  
Investigators may give analgesics, as necessary, for pain control.  
6.8.2  Antibiotics  
For subje cts who develop an infection, appropriate medical therapy ( e.g., with 
antibiotics, antifungals, or antiviral s) or other interventions should be instituted. 
Investigators should use appropriate medical judgment in determining whether a subject 
continue s with RX-3117  during treatment for the infection.

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 47 of 108  6.8.3  Anticancer or Experimental Systemic Therapies Other than 
Investigational Treatments  
No other systemic anticancer therapies (including chemotherapy, antibody therapy, 
immunotherapy, or other experimental therapi es) of any kind are permitted while the 
subject is receiving study treatment.  Subjects are not allowed to participate concurrently 
in any other therapeutic clinical study.  
6.8.4  Antidiarrheals  
For subjects who develop diarrhea, causes related to existing medica l conditions, 
concomitant medications , or gastrointestinal infection should be considered and 
eliminated.  Depending upon the clinical circumstances, endoscopy and biopsy may be 
warranted.  
Antidiarrheals are not allowed prior the administration of RX -3117  on Cycle 1 Day 1 and 
antidiarrheals should not be taken prophylactically  in subsequent cycles .  However, 
antidiarrheals c an be administered on subsequent treatment days and in subsequent 
cycles, based on the judgment of the treating physician  and local in stitutional practices.  
Subjects  should be instructed to begin taking antidiarrheal medication at the first sign of 
any of the following:  (1) poorly formed or loose stool , (2), occurrence of more bowel 
movements than usual in 1 day , or (3) an unusually hig h volume or increased liquidity of 
stool .  
A recommended symptomatic antidiarrheal is loperamide, which may be taken in the 
following manner: 4  mg at the first onset of diarrhea, then 2  mg every 2 hours around the 
clock until diarrh ea-free for at least 12  hours.  Subject s may take loperamide 4  mg every 
4 hours during the night.  Subjects who appear prone to drug -related diarrhea should be 
provided with loperamide so that they have sufficient supply on hand in case 
antidiarrheal support is required.  Alterna te or a dditional antidiarrheal measures may be 
used at the discret ion of the treating physician.  Subject s should be instructed to 
increase fluid intake to help maintain hydration during episodes of diarrhea.  
Depending upon the type and severity of the diarrhea , interruption of RX -3117 and 
rechallenge at the same or a reduced dose level and with appropriate support care 
should be considered.

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 48 of 108  6.8.5  Antiemetics  
Antiemetics are not allowed prior the admin istration of RX -3117 on Cycle 1  Day 1.  
However, antiemetics c an be administered on subsequent treatment days and in 
subsequent cycles, based on the judgment of the treating physician  and local 
institutional practices.  
At the occurrence of drug-related nausea or vomiting of severity Grade   1, it is 
suggested that t he subject receive an oral or transdermal serotonin antagonist ( e.g., 
dolasetron, granisetron, ondansetron, tropisetron, palonosetron).  The neurokinin 
receptor antagonist, aprepitant, may also be considered.  Other classes of antiemetic 
medications that m ay be employed include dopamine antagonists or benzodiazepines.   
If possible, systemic corticosteroids should be avoided due to their many non -specific 
effects . 
Depending upon the type and severity of the vomiting , interruption of RX -3117 and 
rechallenge a t the same or  a reduced dose level and with appropriate support care 
should be considered.  
6.8.6  Contraception  
Sexually active females of childbearing potential must accept continuous heterosexual 
abstinence as a lifestyle choice or agree to use a protocol -recom mended method of 
contraception during heterosexual intercourse throughout the study treatment period and 
for 30  days following discontinuation of RX-3117 .  A female subject is considered to be 
of childbearing potential unless she has had a hysterectomy, bi lateral tubal ligation, or 
bilateral oophorectomy; has medically documented ovarian failure (with serum estradiol 
and follicle -stimulating hormone [FSH] levels within the institutional postmenopausal 
range and a negative serum or urine -human chorionic go nadotropin [ -HCG ]), or is 
menopausal (age  55 years with amenorrhea for  6 months).  Protocol -recommend 
methods of contraception include barrier method with spermicide, intrauterine device 
(IUD), or steroidal contraceptive (oral, transdermal, implanted,  or injected) .   
Sexually active male subjects who can father a child (i.e., are fertile) must accept 
continuous heterosexual abstinence as a lifestyle choice ; limit intercourse to female 
partners who are surgically sterile, post -menopausal, or using effec tive contraception (as 
noted in  Table 3; or agree to use a protocol -recommended method of contraception 
during heterosexual intercourse throughout the study treatment period and for 30 days

6.8.7  Corticosteroids  
Systemic or enteric corticosteroids  are n ot allowed prior the admin istration of RX -3117 
on Cycle 1  Day 1.  Subjects may receive topical  or inhaled corticosteroids while on 
study.  In addition, subjects who develop conditions that may be alleviated by systemic 
or enteric corticosteroid therapy are  permitted to receive such drugs and are not required 
to discontinue study participation  
6.8.8  Diet 
There are no specific dietary restriction s in the study other than that s ubjects should  
refrain from eating for 8 hours before and for 1 hour after each study dru g dose is taken.

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 50 of 108  6.8.9  Drugs with Potential for Interactions with RX -3117  
As described in Section 2.2.4 , in vitro studies indicate that RX -3117 does not inhibit drug 
transporters or CYP enzymes at clinically relevant concentrations;  thus, it is not 
expected that RX -3117 would induce interactions with drugs for which absorption or 
metabolism would be modulated by inhibition of these enzymes.  
As also described in Section 2.2.4 , the primary metabolic route f or disposition of 
RX-3117 is deamination by cytidine deaminase .  These  data imply that strong inhibitors  
or inducers of cytidine deaminase could theoretically increase or decrease RX -3117 
plasma concentrations.  However, such agents are unlikely to be admi nistered in clinical 
practice and thus the risk of altered RX -3117 exposure due to such a drug interaction is 
considered low.  The effect of RX -3117 on CYP induction has not been evaluated.  
6.8.10  Erythropoietin and Granulocyte Colony -Stimulating Factors  
Use of erythropoietic  agents (e.g., erythropoietin or darbepoetin  alpha ) is not permitted 
during Cycle 1 of therapy.  Thereafter, such agents may be administered for Grade  3 
anemia, but their use in this study is discouraged . 
Granulocyte -macrophage colony -stimula ting factor (GM -CSF) should not be 
administered given the potential for GM -CSF-related inflammatory symptoms.  
Use of granulocyte colony -stimulating factor (G -CSF)( e.g., filgrastim, PEG -filgrastim, 
lenograstim)  is not allow in Cycle 1 of therapy.  Prophylac tic administration of G -CSF 
and concomitant administration of RX -3117 and G -CSF is not permitted in support of 
protocol therapy.  However, administration of G -CSF may be considered in a subject 
who, despite RX -3117 dose modification to 30 mg  administered 3  times per week , is 
experiencing recurrent difficulties with recovering from neutropenia in a timely fashion.  
In addition, therapeutic use of G -CSF in subjects with serious neutropenic complications 
such as tissue infection, sepsis syndrome, fungal infect ion, etc., may be considered at 
the investigator's discretion  
Reference may be made to the American Society of Clinical Oncology guidelines (Rizzo 
et al,  2008 ; Smith et al, 2006 ).

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 51 of 108  6.8.11  Immunization  
Due to its potential effects on lymphoid cells, RX -3117 might theoretically impair primary 
or secondary responses to immunization.   For subjects who are at substantial risk of an 
infection ( e.g., influenza) that might be prevented by immunization, consideration should 
be given to providing the vaccine prior to initia tion of study therapy.  
If a vaccine is administered during RX -3117 therapy, vaccination should not be 
performed during Cycle 1 or during any other cycle in a period when the patient is 
experiencing Grade  2 leukopenia.  The safety of immunization with liv e viral vaccines 
during RX -3117  has not been evaluated and vaccination with live virus vaccines during 
study treatment is not recommended.  
6.8.12  Radiation  Therapy  
Radiation therapy is not permitted during Cycle 1 of study treatment. Thereafter, s hort-
term, palli ative radiation therapy can be used  for the management of known, non -
progressing bony metastatic lesions if refractory to standard pain management 
algorithms .  
Since the radiosensitizing properties of RX-3117  have not yet been established, it is 
recommende d that the study drug be stopped  2 days before radiation and re -started 
 2 days after the completion of the course of radiation.  Before treatment occurs, the 
investigator should discuss the method/frequency of radiation administration with the 
sponsor . 
6.8.13  Surgery  or Other Invasive Procedures  
The effects of RX -3117  on coagulation or wound healing  are unknown .  Potential 
RX-3117 myelosuppressive or immunosuppressive effects could enhance the risk of 
peri-procedural bleeding or infection.  
Elective surgical p rocedures (other than placement of IV access devices) should be 
avoided during study drug administration.  However, subjects may undergo necessary 
surgical or invasive procedures for serious intercurrent medical problems; in these 
circumstances, study drug  should be interrupted.   Investigators should use appropriate 
medical judgment in determining whether to resume study drug in the post -procedure 
period.  For subjects resuming study drug, any myelosuppressive effects of the drug

7.9.1  RX-3117  Dosing  
RX-3117  will be administered orally , at the assigned dose , with the subject in a fasted 
state  (i.e.,  8 hours after a meal) with 100 to 200 mL (4 to 8 ounces) of water.  Food 
may be taken  1 hour after the dose has been admi nistered.   The time of dosing must 
be documented.  
On days when the subject is scheduled to come into the clinic, RX-3117  will be 
administered orally  in the presence of site personnel,  per the assigned dose  and 
schedule. This is important for days when blood is collect ed for pharmacokinetic analysis

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 61 of 108  (i.e., Days 1, 8, and 1 5 of Cycle 1 ), on those days dosing will occur after that pre -dose 
pharmacokinetic sample is collected.   
When  subjects self-administer  RX-3117  at home, RX -3117  will be taken orally at 
approximately the same time every day after fasting for a minimum of 8 hours and with 
approximately 4-8 ounces of water. Food may be taken approximately 1 hour after the 
dose has been administered.   
7.10 Safety Follow -Up Visit  
Subjects will undergo the safety follow -up visit approximately 30 days (+ 7 days) after 
the subject receives their last dose of RX -3117 .   
The following procedures will be performed:  
 Recording of concomitant medication(s), including any anticancer therapies 
administere d subsequent to the administration of study drug  
 Recording of adverse event(s).  Serious adverse events will be reported 
immediately.  Any adverse event that is considered related to study drug will be 
followed to resolution or return to baseline.

o Hematology panel  
o Chemistry panel  
o Tumor marker , if applicable  
 Tumor assessment , including CT/MRI/PET as applicable.  Subjects first meeting 
criteria for complete response or partial response at the last on -treatment tumor 
assessment should have a Safety Follow -up tumor assessment if the last 
assessment was performed  ≥ 4 weeks , in order to confirm the response based 
on RECIST ver 1.1 criteria.  Some imaging assessments may be collected for a 
second review by a central imagin g vendor .

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 62 of 108  An unscheduled visit may be performed at any time during the study at the request of 
the subject  or as deemed necessary  by the investigator.  The date and reason for the 
unscheduled visit will be documented in the subject’s medical record and the eCRF, as 
well as any other data obtained (e .g., adverse events, concomitant medications and 
treatments, and results from procedu res or tests).  
7.12 Tumor measurements  
Radiographic tumor assessment(s) performed during the screening period will be used 
to prospectively identify all sites of disease present at the start of treatment.  Subjects 
with symptoms suggestive of disease progressio n should  be objectively evaluated for 
tumor progression.  
On-study t umor assessment (s) will be performed by the investigator .  Response and 
progression will be evaluate using modified RECIST ver 1.1 (see Appendix C) after 
cycles 1 through 4 (e.g, every 4 we eks) and every 8 weeks  thereafter  or upon early 
termination if an assessment has not been done in the previous 4 weeks . The results of 
the tumor assessment must be available before the beginning of the next cycle.   
Radiographic tumor assessment(s) must in clude CT /MRI/PET  of chest, abdomen, and 
pelvis , sufficient to evaluate major  sites of disease.  Throughout the study, the same 
method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize each 
identified and reported lesion at screening.  
See Appendix C for detailed information on  RECIST ver 1.1  to be used in this study.   
Some imaging assessments may be collected for a second review by a central imaging 
vendor . 
8. Other  Assessment(s)  
8.1 Predictive and P harmacodynamic Biomarker  
Biom arkers are objectively measured and evaluated indicators of normal biologic 
processes, pathogenic processes, or pharmacologic responses to a therapeutic 
intervention.  In oncology, there is particular interest in the molecular changes underlying 
the oncoge nic processes that may identify cancer subtypes, stage disease, assess the 
amount of tumor growth, or predict disease progression, metastasis, responses , or 
resistance  to therapeutic agents .  These investigations may be useful in developing 
markers to iden tify disease subtypes, guide therapy, and/or predict disease progression.

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 63 of 108  A blood sample will be collected  prior to treatment with RX -3117  and around the time of 
tumor assessments to measure biomarkers ( e.g., including but not limited to including 
(but not  limited to) concentrative nucleoside transporter (CNT) 2; equilibrative nucleoside 
transporter (ENT) 1; uridine -cytidine kinase (UCK) 1 and 2; DNA methyltransferase 
(DNMT) 1, 3a and 3b; , ribonucleotide reductases (RRM) 1 and 2) and RX -3117 
incorporation i nto DNA/RNA . 
In addition, any paraffin -embedded tumor samples collected independent from this study 
(whether before or during for the assessment of cancer) and the corresponding 
pathology report will be gathered by investigational sites.  If paraffin block s cannot be 
shipped,  unstained slides and a core punch biopsy will be prepared from paraffin 
embedded tumor samples collected independent of the study before and during the 
study from each subject for analysis.  These investigational studies may be useful in 
developing markers to identify disease subtypes, guide therapy and/or predict disease 
response  or progression . 
A tumor biopsy  will be collected pre -treatment (optional).  
Refer to the laboratory manual for detailed collection and handling procedures for all 
predictive biomarker samples.  
8.2 Sample Storage and Destruction  
These blood and tumor samples and any other components from the cells may be stored 
for up to 20 years to research scientific questions related to cancer and/or RX-3117 .  
The subject retains  the right to have the sample material destroyed at any time by 
contacting the principal investigator.   
The sponsor will be the exclusive owner of any data, discoveries, or derivative materials 
from the sample materials and is responsible for the destruct ion of the sample(s) at the 
request of the research subject through the principal investigator or at the end of the 
storage period.  The principal investigator will provide the sponsor with the required 
study and subject numbers so that any remaining blood  and tumor  samples and any 
other components from the cells can be located and destroyed.  If a commercial product 
is developed from this research project, the sponsor will own the commercial product.  
The subject will have no commercial rights to such prod uct and will have no commercial

9. SAFETY DATA COLLECTI ON, RECORDING, AND R EPORTING  
9.1 Definitions  
9.1.1  Adverse Ev ents 
An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a trial subject who is 
administered a drug or biologic (medicinal product) or who is using a medical device; the 
event does not necessarily have a causal relationship with study drug administratio n or 
usage.  
For this protocol, untoward medical occurrences that should be reported as adverse 
events include the following:  
 Any unfavorable  and unintended symptom, sign (including an abnormal laboratory 
finding), or disease temporally associated with the  use of study drug, whether or not 
related to the study drug.  
 Any pre -existing condition that increases in severity or changes in nature during or 
as a consequence of study drug administration.  
 Any complication that occurs as a result of a protocol -manda ted procedure ( e.g., 
venipuncture, ECG, telemetry) in the screening, study drug administration, or follow -
up periods.  
 Any injury or accident occurring during the screening, study drug administration, or 
follow -up periods. If a medical condition is known to  have caused the injury or 
accident (e .g., a fall secondary to dizziness), the medical condition (dizziness) and 
the accident (fall) should be reported as 2 separate adverse events.  
 Any abnormality in physiological testing or a physical examination findin g that 
requires clinical intervention or further investigation (beyond ordering a repeat 
[confirmatory] test).  
 Any laboratory (e .g., clinical chemistry, hematology, urinalysis) or investigational  
abnormality (e .g., ECG, X -ray) independent of the underlyin g medical condition that 
requires clinical intervention, results in further investigation (beyond ordering a 
Protocol Number:  RX -3117 -P1-01  Product:  RX -3117  
19 February  2016  Amendment 0 4 
 
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 65 of 108  repeat [confirmatory] test), or leads to investigational medicinal product interruption 
or discontinuation unless it is associated with an already reported clinical event. If the 
laboratory abnormality is part of a syndrome, the syndrome or diagnosis (e .g., 
anemia) not the laboratory result (e .g., decreased hemoglobin) should be recorded.  
 A complication related to pregnancy or termination of a pregn ancy (see Section  9.7.2  
for additional information).  
None of the following events is considered an adverse event:  
 Laboratory abnormalities not requiring clinical intervention or further investigation. 
Such abnormalities will be captured as part of overall laboratory monitoring.  
 A diagnostic, medical or surgical procedure (e .g., surgery, endoscopy, tooth 
extraction, transfusion). However, the medical condition for which the procedure was 
performed should be reported if it meets the definition of an adverse e vent. For 
example, an acute appendicitis that begins during the adverse event reporting period 
should be reported as the adverse event and the resulting appendectomy should be 
recorded in the subject’s medical records and eCRFs.    
 A pre -existing disease o r condition or laboratory abnormality present or detected 
before the initial screening visit and that does not worsen.  
 An intervention not associated with an untoward medical occurrence (e .g., 
hospitalization for elective surgery or for social and/or conve nience reasons).  
 An overdose without clinical sequel ae. 
9.1.2  Serious Adverse Events  
A serious adverse event is defined as an untoward medical occurrence that results in 
any of the following outcomes:  
 Death  (i.e., all deaths occurring between signing of the con sent form to within 30 
days after last study drug administration), including deaths due to disease 
progression. Deaths that occur as a result of an adverse event that started during the 
study period should be reported. The reported adverse event should be the event 
that caused the death. Death is the outcome of this serious adverse event.

19 February  2016  Amendment 0 4 
 
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 66 of 108   Life-threatening situation  (i.e., with an immediate risk of death from the event as it 
occurred but not including an event that, had it occurred in a more serious form, 
might have caused death).  
 In-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization . Of note, an 
untoward medical occurrence that occurs during hospitalization is an adverse event 
but a complication that prolongs hospitalization is a serious adv erse event. In -patient 
hospitalization comprises formal admission to a hospital for medical reasons, for any 
length of time, whether or not hospitalization extends overnight. However, hospital 
admissions for administration of the study drug, procedures req uired by the study 
protocol, or tumor -related diagnostic procedures are not considered serious.  
 Persistent or significant disability/incapacity.  
 Congenital anomaly/birth defect in the offspring of a subject who received the study 
drug . 
 Other medically sig nificant event . Such events may not be immediately life -
threatening or result in death or hospitalization, but based upon appropriate medical 
and scientific judgment, may jeopardize the subject or may require medical or 
surgical intervention to prevent one  of the outcomes listed above. Examples of such 
events might include:  
o Allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at 
home  
o New cancers or blood dyscrasias  
o Convulsions that do not result in hospitalization  
o Development of drug dependency or drug abuse  
9.2 Other Events Requiring Rapid Reporting  
DLTs  are events [toxicities] specifically identified in this protocol that must be reported to 
the Sponsor  or designee in an expedited manner.  Information regarding DLTs should be  
recorded on  a protocol -designated DLT report form and faxed or emailed to the study 
sponsor or designee  within 24 hours of site personnel becoming aware of the event.   
DLTs  may or may not be serious adverse events  as Unexpected Adverse Event  
An unexpected  adverse eve nt is defined as an event that has a nature or severity, or 
specificity that is not consistent  with the applicable investigator brochure or that is 
symptomatically and pathophysiologically related to a known toxicity but differs because

19 February  2016  Amendment 0 4 
 
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 67 of 108  of greater severity  or specificity. For example, under this definition, hepatic necrosis 
would be unexpected (by virtue of greater severity) if the investigator brochure only 
referred to elevated hepatic enzymes or hepatitis. Similarly, cerebral thromboembolism 
and cerebral vasculitis would be unexpected (by virtue of greater specificity) if the 
investigator brochure only listed cerebral vascular accidents. “Unexpected,” as used in 
this definition, refers to an adverse drug experience that has not been previously 
observed and  reported rather than an experience that has not been anticipated based on 
the pharmacological properties of the study drug.   
9.2.1  Eliciting Adverse Event Information  
The investigator is to report all directly observed adverse events and all adverse events 
spon taneously reported by the study subject. In addition, each study subject will be 
questioned about adverse events at each scheduled clinic visit or during each telephone 
contact with the subject following initiation of study drug administration . The type of  
question asked should be open -ended, e .g., "Have you had any new health problems?”  
or a similar type of query.  
9.3 Reporting Procedures for All Adverse Events  
All adverse events will be assessed by the investigator or qualified designee and 
recorded in the eCRFs. The investigator should attempt to establish a diagnosis of the 
event on the basis of signs, symptoms and/or other clinical information. In such cases, 
the diagnosis should be documented as the adverse event and/or serious adverse event 
and not descr ibed as the individual signs or symptoms. The following information should 
be recorded:  
 Description of the adverse event using concise medical terminology  
 Description as to whether or not the adverse event is serious ( see Section  9.1.2) 
 The start date (dat e of adverse event onset)  
 The stop date (date of adverse event resolution)  
 The severity of the adverse event (see Section  9.4) 
 A description of the potential relatedness of the adverse event to study drug or a 
study procedure (see Section  9.5)

19 February  2016  Amendment 0 4 
 
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 68 of 108   The action taken due to the adverse event  
 The outcome of the adverse event  
9.4 Grading of the Severity of an Adverse Event  
The severity  of adverse events will be graded using the Common Terminology Criteria 
for Adverse Events ( CTCAE ), Version  4.03 ( available at 
http://ev s.nci.nih.gov/ftp1/CTCAE/CTCAE_4.03_2010 -06-
14_QuickReference_8.5x11.pdf ). For each episode, the highest severity grade attained 
should be reported.   
If a CTCAE  criterion does not exist, the investigator should use the grade or adjectives: 
Grade 1 (mild), Grade 2 (moderate), Grade 3 (severe), Grade 4 (life -threatening), or 
Grade 5 (fatal) to describe the maximum intensity of the adverse event. For purposes of 
consistency with the CTCAE, these intensity grades are defined in Table  4. 
Table  4. Grading of Adverse Event Severity  
Grade  Adjective  Description  
Grade 1  Mild Sign or symptom is present, but it is easily tolerated, is not expected to 
have a clinically significant effect on the subject’s overall health and well -
being, does not interfere with the subject’s usual function, and is not 
likely to require medical attention.  
Grade 2  Moderate  Sign or symptom causes interference with usual activity or affect clinical 
status, and may require medical intervention.  
Grade 3 Severe  Sign or symptom is incapacitating or significantly affects clinical status 
and likely requires medical intervention and/or close follow -up. 
Grade 4  Life-
threatening  Sign or symptom results in a potential threat to life.  
Grade 5  Fatal  Sign or sym ptom results in death.  
 
The distinction between  the seriousness and the severity of an adverse event should be 
noted.  Severe is a measure of intensity; thus, a severe reaction is not necessarily a 
serious reaction.   For example, a headache may be severe  in intensity, but would not be 
classified as serious unless it met one of the criteria for serious events listed in Section 
9.1.2 above.

19 February  2016  Amendment 0 4 
 
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 69 of 108  9.5 Describing Adverse Event Relationship to Study Drug and Study 
Procedures  
The relationship  of an adverse event to study  drug should be assessed using clinical 
judgment, describing the event as either unrelated (no) or related (yes) consistent with 
the following definitions:  
 No: Evidence exists that the adverse event had an etiology other than the study 
drug. For serious ad verse events, an alternative causality must be provided (e .g., 
pre-existing condition, underlying disease, intercurrent illness, or concomitant 
medication).  
 Yes:  A temporal relationship exists between the adverse event onset and 
administration of the inve stigational medicinal product that cannot be readily 
explained by the subject’s clinical state or concomitant therapies.  Furthermore, 
the adverse event appears with some degree of certainty to be related to the 
study drug based on the known therapeutic an d pharmacologic actions or 
adverse event profile of the investigational medicinal product. In case of 
cessation or reduction of the dose, the adverse event abates or resolves. In case 
of interruption and rechallenge, the event reappears upon rechallenge.  
Of note, even in circumstances  when the study drug is given intermittently or is 
interrupted temporarily before the onset of the adverse event, consideration should be 
given as to whether the study drug may have contributed to the event.  
The relationship t o protocol -mandated study procedures (e .g., procedures such as 
venipuncture or performance of an ECG ) should be assessed using the following 
considerations:  
 No: Evidence exists that the adverse event has an etiology other than the study 
procedure.  
 Yes: The adverse event occurred as a result of a protocol -mandated procedure .  
9.6 Adverse Event Reporting Requirements  
9.6.1  Site Reporting Requirements  
Classification of an event as serious or nonserious ( see Section  9.1.2) determines the 
reporting procedures to be follow ed by the site.

Serious  Within 24 hou rs Fax or email report on designated serious adverse 
event report form to sponsor or designee , and to 
the site IRB, as per local IRB requirements; include 
copies of relevant source documents (e.g., 
progress notes, autopsy reports, laboratory and 
diagnostic  test results, discharge summaries)

procedure  Record and submit  information on appropriate 
CRFs  
a See Operations Manual for study contact information  
Abbreviations:  CRF=case report form, IRB=institutional review board  
 
For serious adverse events, the Serious Adverse Event Report Form must  be completed 
in addition to  completing the adverse event portion of the CRF.  The information in the 
adverse event portion of the Serious Adverse Event Report Form(s)  and CRF  must 
match or be reconciled.  Where the same data are collected, the forms must be 
completed in a consistent  manner. For example, the same adverse event term should be 
used on both forms.  
Particularly for fatal or life -threatening events, copies of progress notes, autopsy reports, 
laboratory and diagnostic test results, discharge summaries, and other relevant 
documents should be e -mailed or faxed when requested  and applicable.  Follow -up 
information to the serious adverse event should be clearly documented as “follow up” in 
the serious adverse event report form and must be faxed or emailed to these same 
parties.   The study sponsor  may request additional information from the investigator to 
ensure the timely completion of accurate safety reports.  
The subject’s name, address, and other personal identity information should be 
obscured on any source documents ( e.g., progress notes, nurses’ notes, laboratory and 
diagnostic test  results, discharge summaries) but without losing the traceability of a 
document to the study subject identifiers.   Only the subject’s study number, initials, or 
date of birth are to be provided.

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 71 of 108  In the rare event that the investigator does not become aware of the occurrence of a 
serious adverse event immediately (for example, if a subject initially seeks treatment 
elsewhere), the investigator is to report the event within 24 hours after learning  of it and 
to document his/her first awareness of the adverse event.   
Contact details for the study sponsor  medical monitor are provided in  the Operations 
Manual.  
9.6.2  Study Sponsor  Reporting Requirements  
Each serious adverse event report received from the inve stigator must be evaluated by 
the investigator as well as the study sponsor medical monitor.   Each is required to 
review all unanticipated problems involving risk to subjects or others, serious adverse 
events, and all subject deaths associated with the pro tocol and provide an unbiased 
written report of the event.  At a minimum, the study sponsor medical monitor should 
comment on the outcomes of the event or problem, and in the case of a serious adverse 
event or death, comment on the relationship to particip ation in the study.  The 
designated study sponsor medical monitor should also indicate whether they concur with 
the details of the report provided by the study investigator.  
For regulatory reporting purposes, the event is classified as related if any of t he 
investigator or study sponsor medical monitor determines that the event is related to the  
study drug (see Section  9.5).  For reporting purposes, an adverse event will be 
considered expected if the study sponsor determines that the event is expected (see  
Section 9.2).  
The study sponsor a wareness date will be used  in determining adverse event  regula tory 
reporting timelines . The study sponsor a wareness date is defined as the earliest date the 
study sponsor  or an agent ( e.g., a site monitor) becomes aware  of an adverse event.  
This is the date the regulatory reporting clock begins  and the date is considered Day 0 .

If noti fication of an adverse event requiring expedited reporting is received, the study 
sponsor (or designees) will contact each clinical investigator prescribing RX -3117 by 
e-mail, fax, or overnight mail such that the investigator can promptly notify the site I RB 
(within 7  calendar days for deaths or life -threatening events or within for 15  calendar 
days for other reportable events from the study sponsor awareness date ).  All 
unanticipated problems involving risk to subjects  or others, serious adverse events 
related to participation in the study , and subject  deaths related to participation in the 
study will also be promptly reported via telephone, facsimile, or e -mail by the study 
sponsor (or designees) to appropriate health regulatory authorities.  
9.7 Special Situat ion Reporting Requirements  
9.7.1  Definitions of Special Situations   
Special situation include pregnancy; medication error, abuse, misuse, or overdose.  
 Information regarding pregnancy is provided in Section  9.7.2 .  
 A medication error is any  preventable event that  can cause or lead to inappropriate 
medication use or subject  harm while the medication is in the control of a healthcare 
professional  or subject .

19 February  2016  Amendment 0 4 
 
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 73 of 108   Abuse is defined as persistent, sporadic or intentional ly excessive use of a drug by a 
subject  when such use  is accompanied by harmful physical and/or psychological 
effects.  
 Misuse is defined as any use of a drug in a way that is not in accordance with the 
protocol instructions and may be accompanied by harmful physical and/or 
psychological effects.  
 An overdose is defined as a dose taken (accidentally or intentionally) that meets the 
criteria for overdose prescribed by the protocol (see Section  11.7).  In cases of a  
discrepancy in drug accountability, overdose will be established only when it is clear 
that the subject has taken excessive amounts of drug  or the investigator has reason 
to suspect that the subject has taken excessive amounts of drug .  
9.7.2  Pregnancy  
The following safety reporting  instructions related to pregnancy are included as a 
precaution.  
Each fem ale subject should be instructed to discontinue further study therapy and inform 
the investigator immediately if she becomes pregnant at any time between the first dose 
of study drug until 30  days after the last ingestion of study drug.  
Each male subjec t should be instructed to inform the investigator immediately if he 
impregnates a woman at any time  between the 1st dose of study drug until 30  days after  
the last ingestion of study drug  
The investigator should counsel the subject regarding the possible effe cts of 
investigational medicinal  product exposure on the fetus and the need to inform the study 
site of the outcome of the pregnancy.  
Neither a pregnancy itself nor an induced elective abortion to terminate the pregnancy 
without medical reasons is consider ed an adverse event; such occurrences should be 
reported on the appropriate pregnancy report forms.  However, if the outcome of the 
pregnancy meets the criteria for classification as a serious adverse event ( i.e., 
spontaneous abortion, induced abortion due  to complications, stillbirth, neonatal death, 
or congenital anomaly [including that in an aborted fetus]), the investigator should follow 
the procedures for reporting serious adverse events, i.e., report the event to the sponsor 
Protocol Number:  RX -3117 -P1-01  Product:  RX -3117  
19 February  2016  Amendment 0 4 
 
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 74 of 108  or designee  by telephone a nd follow up by submission of the appropriate adverse event 
CRFs (see Section  9.6.1 ). 
Additional information  regarding reporting pregnancy outcomes  may be required :  
 Any spontaneous abortion, including miscarriage and missed abortion will be 
reported as a serious adverse event.  
 An induced therapeutic abortion to terminate any pregnancy due to complications or 
other medical reasons will be recorded as a serious adverse event.  The underlying 
medical reason for this procedure should be recorded as the adverse  event term.  
 All neonatal deaths that occur within 1 month of birth should be reported, without 
regard to causali ty, as serious adverse events.  In addition, any infant death after 1 
month that the investigator assesses as related to the in -utero exposure to the study 
drug should also be reported.  
 In the case of a live birth, the “normality” of the newborn can be assessed at time of 
birth ( i.e., there is no required minimum follow -up of a presumably normal infant 
before the Pregnancy Outcome Report CRF can be completed).  
 The “normality” of an aborted fetus can be assessed by gross visual inspection 
unless there are pre -abortion laboratory findings suggestive of a congenital anomaly, 
in which case pathologic examination should be requested.  
9.7.3  Instructions for Reporting Special Situations  
Information regarding any pregnancy in a study subject  or the female partner of a male 
subject must be documented on a Pregnancy Reporting Form and forwarded to the  
sponsor or designee  within 24 hours of learning of the pregnan cy.  Monitoring of the 
pregnancy in both female study subjects and female partner s of male study subjects 
should continue until the conclusion of the pregnancy.  The outcome of the pregnancy 
should be reported on the Pregnancy Outcome Report Form within 5 days of the  
conclusion of the pregnancy.   If the end of the pregnancy occurs after the study has 
been completed, the outcome should be reported directly to the study sponsor . 
Along with information regarding  the circumstances of the special situation , any clinical 
sequel ae occurring in association with that situation should be reported as adverse

events (see Section  9.6). Details  of signs or symptoms, clinical management and 
outcome s hould be reported, if available defined in this protocol  but may be  serious 
adverse events  if they meet one or more of the criteria for a serious adverse even ts (see 
Section  9.1.2).  If a DLT is also a  serious adverse event, it should be reported both on 
the DLT report form and per the instructions for reporting serious adverse events (see 
Section 9. 6.1). Recording of a DLT in the relevant CRFs will also be required.  
10. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS

10.2 Analysis Conventions  
10.2.1  Analysis Sets  
10.2.1.1  Full Analysis Set  
The full -analysis set includes all subjects who receive  1 dose of RX-3117 .  This 
analysis set will be used in the analyses o f subject characteristics, study drug treatment 
administration, safety  (including first -cycle DLTs) , overall response rate , and progression 
free survival . 
10.2.1.2  Responding Analysis Set  
The responding analysis set includes subjects in the full -analysis set who ha ve 
measurable tumor , who can be evaluated for tumor response with both baseline and on -
study tumor evaluations, and who achieve a complete response  or partial response . This 
analysis set will be use d in the analyses of time to response and duration of resp onse . 
10.2.1.3  Evaluable Analysis Sets  
The evaluable analysis sets include subjects in the full -analysis set who have baseline 
and on -study measurements to provide interpretable results for specific parameters of 
interest.  
These analysis sets will be used in the a nalyses of RX-3117  plasma pharmacokinetics, 
and changes in biomarkers .  
10.3 Sample Size Considerations  
Protocol Number:  RX -3117 -P1-01  Product:  RX -3117  
19 February  2016  Amendment 0 4 
 
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 78 of 108  The sample size calculation for this study has been empirically set.  Approximately 40 
subjects will be recruited in  Phase 1 portion of  this trial.  During Phase 1 study, dose 
escalation will be conducted according to a modified dose escalation rule, with 
potentially 1 subject only per dose and frequency until the appearance of a related grade 
2 or greater adverse even t or the investigator, medical monitor and  sponsor  requesting 
that additional subjects be treated at a dose and/or schedule.   
The Dose Expansion of Phase 1 will enroll approximately 12 subjects at the 
recommended Phase 2 dose or MTD and schedule.  
For the Phase 2 portion of the study, the primary objective is to estimate the antitumor 
activity of RX -3117  in subjects with advanced solid malignancies.   
The maximum number of subjects needed for Phase 2 is approximately 100 (50  per 
solid tumor).   An estimated 20 subjects (10 per indication) will be en rolled in the first 
stage at the recommended Phase 2 dose from the Phase 1  portion .  Those dose 
expansion  subjects who have measurable disease at baseline and at least 1 post -
baseline response assessment may be included in Stage 1 of the Phase2  if the dise ase 
type is one of those to be studied in Phase 2.  The goal is the observation of at least 2 
subjects with progression free survival for at least 4 months and/or 1 objective clinical 
response in a specific tumor indication in order for evaluation of that indication to 
advance to Stage 2.  
In Stage 2, the goal is to further evaluate primary and  secondary endpoints, of efficacy .  
The number of subjects to be enrolled in the second stage will be approximately 80 (40 
per solid tumor indication).  
10.4 Randomization a nd Stratification  
Randomization will not be used in this study.  I n the P hase 2 part of the study, subjects  
will be enrolled in a disease group based on their cancer diagnosis.  No stratification is 
planned for this study.  
10.5 Interim Analysis and Early Stoppi ng Guidelines  
The interim analyses that are planned to be conducted in the Phase 1 are related to the 
review of available data during the dose escalation phase of the study.  The decision to 
escalate to the next dose level  and schedule  will be made after t he evaluation of safety 
Protocol Number:  RX -3117 -P1-01  Product:  RX -3117  
19 February  2016  Amendment 0 4 
 
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 79 of 108  data through at least 2 8 days of the first cycle of the current dose level .  Each review will 
be conducted by the investigators, medical monitor and sponsor .   
The interim analysis in Stage 1 of the Phase 2 will be performed when th e first 10 
subjects have been treated at the recommended Phase 2 dose  and schedule , are 
evaluable for response, have the opportunity to complete up to 4 cycles of therapy or 
have discontinued therapy before 4 cycles.  If 2 responders are observed out of th e 
initial 10 evaluable subjects in one of the specific cancer indication, subject enrollment 
will continue in that indication.   
For the Phase 2, an interim analysis for futility stopping may be conducted to determine 
whether continuation until study compl etion is warranted.  The investigator -assessed 
response rate will be used as the endpoint for the interim analysis.  Although response 
evaluations are repeated after every cycle for the first 4 cycles and then every 2 cycles 
thereafter, all available respo nse data will be included in the interim analysis, a subject 
can be considered a responder with or without available confirmatory imaging.  Each of 
the 2 major indications enrolled in the Phase 2 portion will be evaluated independently, 
and could be subjec t to enrollment hold by individual indication.   
The number of subjects to be enrolled in the second stage will be determined as outlined 
in Section 10.3.   
10.5.1  Data Handling Conventions  
10.5.1.1  General Methods  
By-subject listings will be created for important variabl es from each eCRF module. 
Summary tables for continuous variables will contain the following statistics: N (number 
in population), n (number with data), mean, standard deviation, 95% confidence intervals 
(CIs) on the mean, median, minimum, and maximum.  Summary tables for categorical 
variables will include: N, n, percentage, and 95% confidence interval s on the 
percentage. Unless otherwise indicated, 95% confidence interval s for binary variables 
will be calculated using the binomial distribution (exact metho d) and will be 2 -sided.  
Data will be described and summarized by analysis set, dose level , dose schedule and 
timepoint. As appropriate, changes from baseline to each subsequent timepoint will be 
described and summarized. Similarly, as appropriate, the bes t change from baseline 
during the study will also be described and summarized. Graphical techniques ( e.g., 
Protocol Number:  RX -3117 -P1-01  Product:  RX -3117  
19 February  2016  Amendment 0 4 
 
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 80 of 108  waterfall plots, Kaplan -Meier curves, line plots) may be used when such methods are 
appropriate and informative.  
The baseline value used in each ana lysis will be the last (most recent) pre -treatment 
value. Data from all sites will be pooled for all analyses. Analyses will be based upon the 
observed data unless methods for handling missing data are specified. If there is a 
significant degree of non -normality, analyses may be performed on log -transformed data 
or nonparametric tests may be applied, as appropriate.  
Unless otherwise specified, all analyses will be 2 -sided at the 0.05 level of significance.  
10.5.1.2  Calculation of Pharmacokinetic Variables  
Pharmacok inetic parameters for RX-3117  will be calculated using non -compartmental 
methods. Only plasma concentrations greater than or equal to the validated lower limit of 
quantitation (LLQ) will be used in the pharmacokinetic analyses. Actual blood sampling 
times will be used in all pharmacokinetic analyses. Per -protocol times will be used to 
calculate mean plasma concentrations for graphical displays.  
The C max and T max will be taken directly from the subject’s data. The elimination rate 
constant, z, will be calcu lated as the negative of the slope of the terminal log -linear 
segment of the plasma concentration -time curve. The range of data to be used for each 
subject and treatment will be determined by visual inspection of a semi -logarithmic plot 
of concentration ve rsus time and will comprise  3 data points along the elimination 
phase. Elimination t ½ will be calculated according to the following equation:  
zt693.0½
 
The AUC to the final sample with a concentration LLQ (AUC 0-t) will be calculated using 
the linear trapezoidal method and extrapolated to infinity (AUC ) using:  
zCAUC AUCtf
t  0 inf
 
where C tf is the final concentration LOQ.  
Oral clearance (CL/F) and volume of distribution (Vz/F) will be calculated according to

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 81 of 108  respectively, where AUC represents AUC . 
10.5.1.3  Calculation of Tumor Control Variables  
Tumor control assessments will be based on the standardized RECIST  ver 1.1 , as 
specifically modified for this study (see Appendix C).  Tumor control will be  documented 
at each assessment by response category ( e.g., CR, PR, SD, PD) as defined for each 
response parameter, tumor dimension value s, percentage change in tumor dimension 
values from baseline or nadir, date that response is first documented, date that  response 
is confirmed, and date of disease progression.  
For time -to-event endpoints, only events occurring  30 days following the permanent 
discontinuation of study treatment will be considered as events; for subjects with events 
occurring >  30 days fol lowing the permanent discontinuation of study treatment, the data 
will be censored.  The following censoring conventions will be applied:  
 Duration of Response ( DOR ): Data from surviving, non -progressing  subjects will be 
censored at the earliest of the time  of initiation of antitumor treatment other than the 
study treatment or the last time that lack of tumor  progression was objectively 
documented while on study treatment.  
 Progression Free Survival ( PFS): Data from surviving, non -progressing  subjects will 
be censored at the earliest of the time of initiation of antitumor treatment other than 
the study treatment or the last time that lack of tumor  progression was objectively 
documented while on study treatment.  
10.6 Analysis Plan  
10.6.1  Subject Disposition and Baseline Ch aracteristics  
A listing of all full -analysis subjects will be generated to describe site, subject number, 
first screening date, first treatment date, dose level , dosing schedule,  the longest 
duration of study drug treatment, and the reason for discontinuin g study treatment.  
Available information on subjects who were screened or enrolled  but not treated may be 
listed separately.  A table will be created summarizing these categories in terms of 
number and percent for the full -analysis set.

full-analysis set.  
10.6.2  Exposure and Safety Analyses  
10.6.2.1  Treatment Administration and Study Drug Compliance  
Descript ive information will be provided regarding the number of doses of study therapy 
prescribed, the total number of doses taken, the percent of expected doses taken, the 
duration  of treatment, and the number and timing of prescribed dose reductions , dose 
interruptions, and dose re -escalations . 
RX-3117  compliance will be described in terms of the proportion of study drug actually 
taken based on subject diaries and returned capsule  count s relative to the amount that 
was dispensed (account ing for  physician -prescri bed reductions and interruptions).  
10.6.2.2  RX-3117  Pharmacokinetics  
Plasma concentrations and derived pharmacokinetic parameters (see Section  10.2.2.2 ) 
will be listed and graphs of individual subject concentrations by visit will be presented on 
linear and semi -logarithmic axes.  Pharmacokinetic data will be summarized by visit 
using graphical and tabular meth ods considering stage, dose  level and schedule .  The 
data may be evaluated by baseline variables such as sex, weight, body -mass index, 
age, and cancer type.  
The relationship between the parameters C max, AUC inf, and AUC 0-24 and dose will be 
examined using the power model, i.e., 
P = a  Doseb 
where P represents the parameter and a and b are constants. A value of b of 
approximately 1 indicates linear pharmacokinet ics.  
As appropriate, data regarding plasma concentrations and pharmacokinetics parameters 
for major and/or active metabolites in retained plasma samples will be described.

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 83 of 108  10.6.2.3  Prior, Concomitant, and Post -Treatment Medication Use  
Prior, concomitant, and post -treatment medications will be coded by means of the World 
Health Organization Drug Dictionary (WHODRUG) dictionary into 
Anatomical -Therapeutic -Chemical classification (ATC) codes.  
Descriptions of prior medication use will be focused on drugs and regimens used as 
treatments for cancer.   As appropriate and if available, information on the sequencing, 
and type of p rior regimens will be collected . 
The type and timing of use of concomitant medications will be listed and summarized. 
Information regarding the typ e and use of specific supportive medications ( e.g., 
antiemetics, antidiarrheals, hematopoietic growth factors, corticosteroids) during study 
treatment will be described.  
10.6.2.4  Adverse Events  
All adverse events will be listed. The focus of adverse event summariza tion will be on 
treatment -emergent adverse events.  A treatment -emergent adverse event is defined as 
an adverse event that occurs or worsens in the period from the first dose of study 
treatment to 30  days after the last dose of study treatment.  Adverse ev ents that occur 
before the first dose of study treatment or >  30 days after the subject has been 
discontinued from study treatment will be included in data listings.  
Adverse events will be classified usi ng MedDRA (http://www.meddramsso.com) with 
descriptio ns by System Organ Class, High -Level Group Term, High -Level Term, 
Preferred Term, and Lower -Level Term. The severity of adverse events will be graded 
by the investigator according to the CTCAE,  Version  4.03 
(http://evs.nci.nih.gov/ftp1/CTCAE/CTCAE_4.03_201 0-06-
14_QuickReference_8.5x11.pdf ), whenever possible. If a CTCAE criterion does not exist 
for a specific type of adverse event, the grade corresponding to the appropriate adjective 
will be used by the investigator to describe the maximum intensity of the adverse event: 
Grade 1 (mild), Grade 2 (moderate), Grade 3 (severe), Grade 4 (life threatening), or 
Grade 5 (fatal). The relationship of the adverse event to the study drug will be 
categorized as related or unrelated.  
Treatment -emergent adverse events will  be summarized. Summary tables will be 
presented to show the number of subjects reporting treatment -emergent adverse events

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 84 of 108  by severity grade and corresponding percentages.  A subject who reports multiple 
treatment -emergent adverse events within the same P referred Term (or System Organ 
Class) is counted only once for that Preferred Term (or System Organ Class) using the 
worst severity grade. Adverse event descriptions will be presented in alphabetical order 
of System Organ Class, then by decreasing frequenc y in the “overall” column for a given 
Preferred Term.  
Separate listings and summaries will be prepared for the following types of treatment -
emergent adverse events:  
 Dose -limiting adverse events occurring in Cycle 1 of therapy  
 Study -drug-related adverse eve nts 
 Adverse events that are Grade  3 in severity  
 Adverse events leading to study drug interruption and/or dose modification  
 Adverse events leading to study drug discontinuation  
 Serious adverse events (with categorization of the primary reason that the 
adverse event is considered serious, e.g., death, hospitalization, etc)  
10.6.2.5  Laboratory Evaluations  
All laboratory data will be listed. Summaries of laboratory data will be based on observed 
data and will be reported using conventional units.  The focus of laborat ory data 
summarization will be on treatment -emergent laboratory abnormalities.  A treatment -
emergent laboratory abnormality is defined as an abnormality that, compared to 
baseline, worsens by  1 grade in the period from the first dose of study treatment t o 
30 days after the last dose of study treatment.  If baseline data are missing, then any 
graded abnormality ( i.e., an abnormality that is Grade  1 in severit y) will be considered 
treatment -emergent. Laboratory abnormalities that occur before the first do se of study 
treatment or >  30 days after the subject has been discontinued from study treatment will 
be included in data listings.  
Hematological, serum biochemistry, and urine data will be programmatically graded 
according to CTCAE severity grade, when app licable.  For parameters for which a 
CTCAE scale does not exist, reference ranges from the local laboratory will be used to

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 85 of 108  determine programmatically if a laboratory parameter is below, within, or above the 
normal range for the subject’s age, sex, etc.  
Hematological and serum biochemistry and their changes from baseline will be 
summarized.  Summary tables will be presented for each relevant assay to show the 
number of subjects by CTCAE severity grade with corresponding percentages.  For 
parameters for whic h a CTCAE scale does not exist, the frequency of subjects with 
values below, within, and above the normal ranges will be summarized.  Subjects will be 
characterized only once for a given assay, based on their worst severity grade observed 
during a period o f interest ( e.g., during the study or from baseline to a particular visit).  
Shift tables for hematology and serum biochemistry will also be presented by showing 
change in CTCAE severity grade from baseline to each visit.  For parameters for which a 
CTCAE s cale does not exist, shift tables will be presented showing change in results 
from baseline (normal, low and high [or abnormal]) to each visit (normal, low and high [or 
abnormal]).  Tables will be prepared to show frequencies adjusted for baseline values; 
for this frequency, subjects with the same or worse toxicity grade at baseline are not 
considered.  
Separate listings and summaries will be prepared for laboratory abnormalities that are 
Grade   3 in severity.  
10.6.2.6  Electrocardiography  
The ECG parameters (heart r ate, PR interval, QRS interval, QT interval, and corrected 
QT [QTc] interval) at each time recorded as well as the change from screening will be 
listed and summarized .  These parameters will be determined electronically by the ECG 
machine at the clinical s ite.  The QT interval will be corrected by the Fridericia methods 
as follows:  
 Fridericia: QTcF = QT/(RR)1/3 
The overall ECG assessment  will be reported as “Normal”  or “Abnormal ” with respect to 
relevant abnormalities by the investigator.  A shift table com paring  the ECG assessment 
over the study drug administration period  to screening  will be presented.  
The QTc data obtained by using the Fridericia corrections will be categorized separately 
into the following classifications and summarized by time after st udy drug dosing:

 QTc interval >  480 msec and ≤  500 msec  
 QTc interval >  500 msec  
The change of the QTc values obtained by using the Fridericia’s correction will also be 
categorized separately as follows:  
 QTc interval increases from baseline by >  30 m sec and ≤  60 msec  
 QTc interval increases from baseline by >  60 msec  
QTc data will be presented in shift tables consistent with these categories.  
10.6.2.7  Oxygen Saturation Values  
All oxygen saturation data will be listed.  Summaries of oxygen saturation data will b e 
based on observed data and will be reported as percent ( %) saturation.  Data and 
changes from baseline will be summarized.  Summary tables will be presented for 
values below 92% and for declines from baseline of  5% to show the number of 
subjects with c orresponding percentages.  Subjects will be characterized only once for 
each of these categorizations, based on their lowest value observed during a period of 
interest ( e.g., during the study or from baseline to a particular visit).  
10.6.2.8  Other Safety Variables  
Vital signs, weight, and p erformance status data will be appropriately described.  
10.6.3  Efficacy Analyses  
10.6.3.1  Categorical Endpoints  
As appropriate depending up the level of activity and the numbers of patients with 
individual tumor types that are accrued, ORR, CR and PR rates may be determined and 
described. In the analyses of ORR, subjects who do not have sufficient baseline or on -
study tumor assessment to characterize response will be counted as failures .  For all 
analyses, the corresponding 95% confidence interv als will be presented.  
10.6.3.2  Time -to-Event Tumor Control and Survival Endpoints  
Time to response , duration of response , and progression free survival  will be described

regression model) will be presented.  
10.6.3.3  Continuous Endpoints  
Changes in tumor dimension values will be assessed using analysis of covariance 
(ANCOVA) with baseline values as covariates ; in these analyses, both changes from 
baseline to each subsequent timepoint and best overall on -study changes will be 
evaluated. Means and standard errors will be presented.  
10.6.4  Other Analyses  
Data explorations may be performed to evaluate potential associati ons among  subject 
characteristics , biomarkers, RX -3117 dose,  RX-3117 schedule  and outcome measures. 
Explorations may also be performed to assess the potential associations between 
different outcomes measures ( e.g., relationships between pharmacokinetic par ameters , 
biomarkers  and adverse event changes in tumor dimensions ). 
10.7 Statistical Basis for the Dose Escalation Paradigm  
In this dose -escalation trial designed to determine an MTD for RX -3117, the sample size 
for the study is not based on a formal statistica l hypothesis but will be determined based 
on the observed number of first -cycle DLTs at each dose level  and its schedule .  
To accelerate the early dose escalation and avoid treating excessive numbers of 
patients with innocuous but ineffective dose levels o f RX-3117, the dose escalation will 
be performed initially with a single patient at each dose level. After the occurrence of at 
least one Grade  2 adverse event that is considered related to RX -3117, the study will 
transition to a standard 3 + 3 design in  which 3 to 6 subjects will be treated at each of 
the proposed RX-3117  dose levels  and schedules .  Based on the planned 3+3 dose -
escalation scheme, Table 7 shows the probability of escalating to the next dose level 
based on the true rate of DLT at the curr ent dose level.  
Protocol Number:  RX -3117 -P1-01  Product:  RX -3117

Table 7: Probability of Dose Escalation (N=3+3)  
True Incidence of DLT  Probability of Escalating

30% 0.49 
40% 0.31 
50% 0.17 
60% 0.08 
Abbreviation: DLT=dose -limiting toxicity  
 
Thus, if the true underlying proporti on of DLT is low ( e.g.,  10% at the current dose 
level, there is a high probability (  0.91) of dose escalation to the next dose level. 
Conversely, if the true underlying proportion of DLT is high ( e.g.,  60%) at the current 
dose level, there is a low pr obability (  0.08) of escalation to the next dose level.  
The trial employs the standard NCI definition of MTD (starting dose associated with DLT 
in < 33.3% of subjects during the first cycle  of therapy).  
10.8 Timing of Analyses  
10.8.1  Interim Analyses  
No formal inte rim analyses are planned in this Phase 1 trial.   The sponsor study  team  (or 
a specially delegated committee of expert clinicians)  and the investigators will 
collectively discuss study conduct and accumulating safety and other data through 
teleconferences.  It is expected that these discussions will be scheduled at intervals of 
~4 weeks unless accrual to the study and the need for decisions regarding dose 
escalation or stage progression indicate the need for more frequent or less frequent 
reviews.  
10.8.2  Final Anal ysis 
Final study reporting is expected to occur after all subjects have discontinued study 
treatment and completed the safety follow up visit or 24 weeks after accrual of the final 
subject.  Addenda to the study report may be created to account for subject s still on 
study at the time of the major analysis of the study .

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 90 of 108  The clinic pharmacist or an alternative q ualified person will provide each subject  with 
directions regarding drug storage and instructions regarding how many of each 
size/color of capsule to use at each dosing.  The subject number , subject initials, dose 
assigned , and number of capsules to b e tak en will be written on the bottle l abel by site 
personnel . 
11.6 Procedures for Monitoring Subject Compliance  
Each study site  will be responsible for monitoring subject  compliance  through subject 
interviews and counting of unused study drug capsules .  
At the time  of study drug dispensing, the site personnel will show subjects how to 
complete a subject diary card with a record of the number of capsules of RX -3117 that 
they have taken daily at home and how to record any problems with drug administration 
or reasons f or noncompliance.  Site personnel will instruct subject s that they must bring 
the diary card back after each study visit.  The site personnel will need to evaluate 
subjects’  diary card s for completeness  after each dispensing interval.  
In addition, subjects  should be instructed to return all bottles (used or unused) and any 
unused study medication to the study site at the end of each dispensing interval.  The 
quantity of RX -3117 and the date when it is returned by the subject should be recorded 
in the study drug accountability records.  All RX -3117 returned by the subject should be 
retained for review by the study site monitor prior to return to the study sponsor or 
destruction.  
If it is determined that a subject  is substantially non complian t with the study p rotocol  in 
circumstances that increase risk or substantially compromise the interpretation of study 
results , the investigator and the sponsor should determine whether the subject  should be 
withdrawn from study treatment.  If the subject is withdrawn for no ncompliance, the 
institutional review board should be notified.  
11.7 Drug Accountability  
The disposition of all RX-3117  should be documented from the time of receipt at the site 
through dispensing  to study subjects, drug return, or drug destruction.  All drug s upplies 
and associated documentation will be periodically reviewed and verified by the study 
monitor over the course of the study.

19 February  2016  Amendment 0 4 
 
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 91 of 108  Study personnel must ensure that all study drug is kept in a secure locked area with 
access limited to authorized personnel.  The study drug must not be used outside the 
context of this protocol.  Under no circumstances should the investigator or site 
personnel supply study drug to other investigators or clinics, or allow the study drug to 
be used other than as directed by this protocol.  
The investigator and/or the responsible site personnel must maintain accurate records of 
the receipt of all study drug shipped by the study sponsor or its designee, including, but 
not limited to : the date received, lot number, amount received, condition of the study 
drug, and the disposition of all study drug.  Study drug accountability records must also 
be maintained that include the subject number to whom the study drug was dispensed ; 
the date, quantity and lot number of the study drug dispensed ; and the identity of the 
person dispensing the medication.  
Depending upon the decision of the study sponsor , remaining unused study drug supply 
will be returned to the study sponsor or its designee after the study is completed or will 
be discarded or dest royed at the clinical site.  Drug may be returned or destroyed on an 
ongoing basis during the study if appropriate.  If the study drug is discarded or destroyed 
at the clinical site, standard institutional policy should be followed.  Records 
documenting th e date of study drug return  or destruction, relevant lot numbers, and the 
amount returned  or destroyed should be maintained.  
11.8 Overdose Precautions  
There is limited prior clinical experience with RX -3117.  Administration of very high 
single IV doses of RX -3117 to monkeys induced convulsions, tremors, and lack of 
coordination.  Myelotoxicity is a known dose -dependent consequence of anti -metabolite 
administration.  
In this protocol, an overdose is defined as administration of more than the prescribed 
daily dos e of RX -3117 . In a subject who experiences an overdose, consideration should 
be given as to whether RX -3117 administration should be temporarily interrupted.   If the 
overdose ingestion is recent and substantial, and if there are no medical 
contraindication s, use of gastric lavage or induction of emesis may be considered. 
Observation for any symptomatic side effects should be instituted, and biochemical and 
hematological parameters should be followed closely (consistent with the protocol or 
Protocol Number:  RX -3117 -P1-01  Product:  RX -3117

effects should be initiated.  
The study sponsor should be contacted if a study drug overdose occurs. Cases of study 
drug overdose will result in specific reporting requirements (see Section  9.6.1). 
11.9 Inadvertent Exposure and Spill Precautions  
Based on available data from nonclinical studies, RX -3117 may be  acutely toxic  and 
genotoxic.  It is not anticipated that the study drug would be irritative at levels that are 
likely to result from inadver tent exposure to the contents of broken capsules.   
Personnel handling the drug should use reasonable precautions to avoid ingestion of the 
study drug  product or eye contact, skin contact, or inhalation  of the study drug 
substance . Study subjects should be strongly advised to store the drug appropriately, 
keep the drug in a secure place out of the reach of children and to avoid mixing study 
drug capsules with other medications.

13.5 Publication Policy  
To coordinate dissemination of data from this study, the s ponsor encourages the 
formation of a publication committee consisting of several principal investigators and 
appropriate sponsor staff.  The committee is expected to solicit input and assistance 
from other investigators and the s ponsor staff as appropriate.  Membership on the 
committee (both for investigators and the s ponsor ’s staff) does not guarantee 
authorship —the criteria described below should be met for every publication.  
Authorship of any publications resulting from this study will be determined on the basis 
of the Uniform Requirement for Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical Journals 
(International Committee of Medical Journal Editors, 2005), which states:  
 Authorship credit should be based on (1) substantial contributions to conception 
and design, acquisition of data, or analysis and interpretation of data; (2) drafting 
the article or revising it critically for important intellectual content; (3) final 
approval of the version to be published.  Authors should meet conditions 1, 2, 
and 3.  
 When a large, multicenter group has conducted the work, the group should 
identify the individuals who accept direct responsibility for the manuscript.  These 
individuals should fu lly meet the criteria for authorship defined above.  
 Acquisition of funding, collection of data, or general supervision of the research 
group, alone, does not justify authorship.  
 All persons designated as authors should qualify for authorship, and all those  
who qualify should be listed.

(Eisenhauer et al, 2009 ) 
 Definitions  
At baseline, tumor lesions/lymph nodes will be categorized measurable or 
non-measurable as follows:  
- Measurable Disease  - the presence of at least one measurabl e lesion. If 
the measurable disease is restricted to a solitary lesion, its neoplastic nature 
should be confirmed by cytology/histology.  
- Measurable Lesions  - lesions that can be accurately measured in at least 
one dimension with longest diameter  20 mm us ing chest X -ray or  10 mm 
with CT scan.  
- Non-measurable Lesions  - all other lesions, including small lesions 
(longest diameter <20  mm with chest X -ray or ≥ 10 but <  15 mm with CT 
scan), i.e., bone lesions, leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural/pericardi al 
effusion, inflammatory breast disease, lymphangitis cutis/pulmonis, cystic 
lesions, and also abdominal masses that are not confirmed and followed by 
imaging techniques; and.  
 All measurements should be taken and recorded in metric notation, using a ruler  
or calipers. All baseline evaluations should be performed as closely as possible 
to the beginning of treatment and never more than 28 days before study day 1.  
 The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to 
characterize each identi fied and reported lesion throughout the trial.  
 Clinical lesions ( e.g., skin nodules and palpable lymph nodes ) will only be 
considered measurable target lesions when they ≥ 15 mm . For the case of skin 
lesions, documentation by color photography, including a  ruler to estimate the 
size of the lesion, is recommended.  
 Lymph nodes that are < 10 mm will be considered non -pathological  
 
Methods of Measurement  
 CT and MRI are the best currently available and reproducible methods to 
measure target lesions selected fo r response assessment. Conventional CT and 
MRI should be performed with cuts no greater than 5  mm in slice thickness 
contiguously. This applies to tumors of the chest, abdomen and pelvis. Head and 
neck tumors and those of extremities usually require specif ic protocols.  
 When the primary endpoint of the study is objective response evaluation, 
ultrasound should not be used to measure tumor lesions.  It is, however, a 
possible alternative to clinical measurements of superficial palpable lymph 
nodes, subcutaneou s lesions and thyroid nodules. Ultrasound might also be 
useful to confirm the complete disappearance of superficial lesions usually 
assessed by clinical examination.  
 The utilization of endoscopy and laparoscopy for objective tumor evaluation has 
not yet be en fully and widely validated. Their uses in this specific context require

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 106 of 108  sophisticated equipment and a high level of expertise that may only be available 
in some centers. Therefore, the utilization of such techniques for objective tumor 
response should b e restricted to validation purposes in specialized centers. 
However, such techniques can be useful in confirming complete pathological 
response when biopsies are obtained.  
 Cytology and histology can be used to differentiate between partial response and 
complete response in rare cases ( e.g., after treatment to differentiate between 
residual benign lesions and residual malignant lesions in tumor types such as 
germ cell tumors).  
 
Baseline Documentation of “Target” and “Non -Target” Lesions  
 All measurable lesion s up to a maximum of 2 lesions per organ and 5 lesions in 
total, representative of all involved organs should be identified as target lesions 
and recorded and measured during screening.   
 Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions  with the 
longest diameter) and their suitability for accurate repeated measurements 
(either by imaging techniques or clinically).   
 A sum of the longest diameter (LD) for all target lesions will be calculated and 
reported as the baseline sum LD. The baseli ne sum LD will be used as reference 
by which to characterize the objective tumor.  
 All other lesions (or sites of disease) should be identified as non -target lesions 
and should also be recorded during screening. Measurements of these lesions 
are not require d, but the presence or absence of each should be noted 
throughout the study.  
 
Response Criteria  
Evaluation of Target Lesions  
* Complete Response (CR):  Disappearance of all target lesions .  Any pathologic 
lymph nodes (whether target or non -target) mush ha ve 
reduction in short axis to < 10 mm  
* Partial Response (PR):  At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters  of 
target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum 
diameters  
* Progressive Disease (PD):  At least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters  of 
target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum 
diameters  recorded since the treatment started or the 
appearance of one or more new lesions .  In addition the 
relative increase of 20%, the sum must also 
demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm.  
Appearance of one or more new lesions is also 
considered progression.  
* Stable Disease (SD):  Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor 
sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease, 
taking as reference the smallest sum diame ters while 
on study.

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 107 of 108   
Evaluation of Non -Target Lesions  
* Complete Response (CR):  Disappe arance of all non -target lesions.  All lymph 
nodes must be non -pathological in size (i.e., < 10 mm 
short axis)  
* Incomplete Response/          
Stable Disease (SD):   Persistence of one or more non -target lesion(s)  
* Progressive Disease (PD):  Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or 
unequivocal progression of existing non -target lesions 
(1)  
(1) Although a clear progression of “non target” lesions only is exceptio nal, in such 
circumstances, the opinion of the treating physician should prevail.  
 
Evaluation of Best Overall Response  
The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the treatment 
until disease progression/recurrence (taking as r eference for progressive disease the 
smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started). In general, the subject 's 
best response assignment will depend on the achievement of both measurement and 
confirmation criteria

 Subjects  with a global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of 
treatment without objective evidence of disease progres sion at that time should 
be classified as having “symptomatic deterioration”. Every effort should be made 
to document the objective progression even after discontinuation of treatment.

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 108 of 108   In some circumstances it may be difficult to distinguish residual dise ase from 
normal tissue. When the evaluation of complete response depends on this 
determination, it is recommended that the residual lesion be investigated (fine 
needle aspirate/biopsy) to confirm the complete response status.  
 
Confirmation  
 The main goal of  confirmation of objective response is to avoid overestimating 
the response rate observed.  In cases where confirmation of response is not 
feasible, it should be made clear when reporting the outcome of such studies that 
the responses are not confirmed.  
 To be assigned a status of partial response or complete response, changes in 
tumor measurements must be confirmed by repeat assessments during the 
study.   
 In the case of SD, follow -up measurements must have met the SD criteria no 
earlier than 49 days after the date of enrollment/randomization during the study.    
 
Duration of Overall Response  
 The duration of overall response is measured from the time measurement criteria 
are met for complete response or partial response (whichever status is recorded 
first) u ntil the first date that recurrence or progressive disease is objectively 
documented, taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest 
measurements recorded since the treatment started.  
Duration of Stable Disease  
 SD is measured from the start of th e treatment until the criteria for disease 
progression are met, taking as reference the smallest measurements recorded 
since the treatment started.

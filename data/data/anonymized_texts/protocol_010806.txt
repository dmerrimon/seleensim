SYNOPSIS  Title of 
Study:  A Phase I Dose -Escalation Study of Vincristine Sulfate Liposome Injection 
(Marqibo®) in Combination with Bendamustine and Rituximab (BRiM) in Indolent 
non-Hodgkin Lymphoma  
Sponsor:  Adam Olszewski, MD  
IND Number:  Study Exempt from IND Requirements per 21 CFR 312.2(b)  and IND exemption 
letter from the FDA .   
Study Centers:  Brown University Oncology Research Group – Rhode Island Hospital  
Objectives:  Primary objective:  
• To establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose -limiting toxicity 
(DLT) of vincristine sulfate liposome injection (Marqibo®) in combination 
with bendamustine and rituximab (BRiM).  
• To establish the dose -limiting toxicities (DLT) of vincristine sulfate liposome 
injection (Marqibo®) in combination with bendamustine and rituximab 
(BRiM). 
Secondary objectives:  
• To evaluate cumulative rates of non -DLT toxicities of the BRiM combination 
in patients with non- Hodgkin lymphoma.  
• To evaluate tolerability, assess ed by rate of completion of the planned six 
cycles of BRiM chemotherapy. 
• To evaluate response rate (RR) and complete response rate (CR) of the BRiM 
regimen in the study population of indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma patients.  
Study Design:  
 Phase 1, single -center, open -label, single -arm trial  in 10 patients with indolent  B-cell 
non-Hodgkin lymphoma otherwise appropriate for bendamustine -rituximab as initial 
or subsequent line of therapy.  Patients will receive the BRiM regimen, consisting of 
rituximab  and bendamustine  (standard doses)  in combination with vincristine sulfate 
liposome injection ( Marqibo® )—at a patient- specific dose determined by the 
Escalation With Overdose Control (EWOC) protocol , from 1.8 mg/m2 to the ceiling 
dose of 2.4 mg/m2. The treatment will continue at the same dose for up to 6 cycles. 
Patients will be evaluated weekly during C ycle 1 to assess toxicity and identify dose -
limiting toxicities  (DLT) . During Cycle 2-6 p atients will be followed every two 
weeks. The response to chemotherapy will be evaluated after Cycle s 3 and 6 of 
treatment - see section 6 . The maximum tolerated dose (MTD, recommended phase 
II dose) of Marqibo® in the BRiM combination will be defined upon completion of the trial as the median of the marginal posterior distribution of the MTD. The trial 
will be terminated if the first three patients experience a DLT or anytime the 
posterior probability that the DLT rate at the minimum dose exceeds 0.33 is 0.8 
or more.

BrUOG 326 Protocol       Version  Date: 5/1/2020  
3 Study Treatment 
Assignments  • Rituximab  at 375 mg/m2 intravenously over 3 -5 hours on Day 1  
• Bendamustine  at 90 mg/m2 intravenously over  10 to 30 minutes on Day 1, 2 
• Marqibo ® at patient -specific dose, intravenously over 60 minutes on Day 2  
—every 28 days for up to s ix cycles.  
Number of Subjects:  Ten (10)  patients will be treated .  
Target Population:  Adult subjects with indolent B-cell non-Hodgkin  lymphoma otherwise appropriate 
for therapy with bendamustine -rituximab regimen according to current National 
Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN G uidelines ®). The following subtypes are 
allowed:  
• Follicular lymphoma;  
• Mantle cell lymphoma;  
• Marginal zone lymphoma, not amenable to curative therapy;  
• Small lymphocytic lymphoma;  
• Lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma;  
• Other indolent B -cell lymphomas (including not otherwise specified, NOS);  
Patients may receive the protocol therapy as the initial or subsequent line of 
treatment, as long as bendamustine -rituximab is an otherwise clinically appropriate 
treatment option.  
Duration of  
Treatment:  In the absence of clinical or radiographic progression or prohibitive toxicity, patients 
will continue therapy for up to six 28 -day cycles.  
Discontinuation:  Patients may  be discontinued from the study treatment for the following reasons:  
• Occurrence of a DLT in the first cycle of treatment,  
• Disease progression,  
• The need for administration of therapy for lymphoma not specified in the 
protocol; this includes any form of chemotherapy, radiation therapy or biologic 
therapy;  
• Intercurrent illness that prevents f urther administration of treatment,  
• Adverse event(s) deemed unacceptable by the patient or the treating physician,  
• Patient decides to withdraw from the study for any reason, or 
• General or specific changes in the patient's condition render the patient 
unacc eptable for further treatment in the judgment of the investigator.  
Diagnosis and Main 
Eligibility Criteria:  
 • Eligibility criteria : Patients must have histologically confirmed indolent B -cell 
non-Hodgkin lymphoma, CD20- positive, previously treated or untreated -for 
which bendamustine -rituximab chemotherapy is clinically indicated; the 
following subtypes are allowed: Follicular lymphom a; Mantle cell lymphoma; 
Marginal zone lymphoma; Small lymphocytic lymphoma; Lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma, or Indolent B -cell lymphoma, NOS.  
• Radiological measurable disease, defined as any measurable lesion >15 mm on the staging CT or PET/CT. Patients with blood or bone marrow involvement only are ineligible. Splenomegaly is acceptable as a measurable site if enlarged on the initial CT scan (>13 cm in the cranio -caudal dimension).  
• Previous treatment for lymphoma is allowed, with the exception of use of benda mustine within 180 days of the date of the consent form, or any prior use 
of vincristine sulfate liposome injection (Marqibo®) .  
• Age ≥18 years.   
• ECOG performance status 0 or 1 (see Appendix A).  
• Life expectancy of greater than 6 months.  
• Patients must have adequate organ and marrow function as defined below:  
BrUOG 326 Protocol       Version  Date: 5/1/2020  
4 o leukocytes   ≥3,000/mm3  
o absolute neutrophil count  ≥1,000/mm3  
o platelets                        ≥75,000/mm3  
o total bilirubin  within normal institutional limits  
o AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT)  < 2.5 × institutional ULN  
o creatinine   <2.0 mg/mL  
o AND  
o creatinine clearance   <50 mL/min/1.73 m2.  
calculated by method of Cockroft and Gault  
• Prevention of pregnancy.  
• The effects of bendamustine and vincristine on the developing human fetus are 
unknown.  For this reason and because Cla ss D agents as well as other 
therapeutic agents used in this trial are known to be teratogenic, women and men of child -bearing potential must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal 
or barrier method of birth control; abstinence ; vasectomy ) prior to study entry 
and up to 4 months after the last dose of study treatment.  
• Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test within 14 days prior to first treatment on study (Cycle 1, Day 1). Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.  
Postmenopausal women (after surgical menopause or no menses for >12 
months) do not need to have a pregnancy status, but their postmenopausal status must be documented.  
• Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.  
 
Exclusion criteria:  
• History of any allergic reaction attributed to rituximab (with the exception of <grade 3 infusion 
reaction), bendamustine, vincristine sulfate, Marqibo®, 
mannitol, sodium phosphate injection or sphingomyelin/cholesterol liposome.  
• Patients who have had any lymphoma -directed radiotherapy, chemotherapy, 
biologic or experimental therapy, oral or intravenou s, within 4 weeks (6 weeks 
for nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study or those who have not recovered from adverse events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier to ≤ grade 1 -with the exception of alopecia, which is allowed.  
• Any prior treatment with vincristine sulfate liposome injection (Marqibo®).  
• Prior treatment with bendamustine or vincristine sulfate within 180 days of enrollment. Prior treatment with rituximab is allowed.  
• Patients who are receiving any other investigatio nal agents or anti -cancer 
therapy with the exception of endocrine therapy for breast or prostate cancer . 
• Patients with known central nervous system involvement (infiltration of the brain, meninges or cerebrospinal fluid) by the lymphoma are excluded from t his 
clinical trial because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop 
progressive neurologic dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of 
neurologic and other adverse events.  
• Active peripheral sensory or motor neuropathy > grade 1. This is  defined by the 
CTCAE as any neuropathy requiring intervention or limiting instrumental 
activities of daily life.  
• History of demyelinating form of Charcot -Marie -Tooth syndrome, acquired 
demyelinating disorders, or other demyelinating condition.  
• Documented positive test for the Human Anti -Chimeric Antibody (HACA).  
• Patients receiving any medications or substances that are strong inhibitors or 
inducers of CYP3A enzyme are ineligible.   
BrUOG 326 Protocol       Version  Date: 5/1/2020  
5 • Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or  active 
infection (that requires antibiotic use which is not prophylactic), symptomatic 
congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or 
psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study 
requirements. In  cases of uncertainty, the PI will decide whether an illness is 
considered prohibitive. Suppressive antiviral therapy with acyclovir, 
famciclovir, or valacyclovir for herpes simples or herpes zoster is allowed.  
• Prisoners.  
• Pregnant or breast -feeding women.  
• Known Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) or active Hepatitis B infection (defined as presence of HBV DNA or hepatitis B S antigen in the blood).  
• Any prior or active cancer, which in the opinion of the investigator would 
preclude safe participation in this study.  
Study Procedures/  
Frequency:  Patients will undergo screening and registration procedures, including staging of 
their lymphoma using a CT scan or a PET/CT scan and, if clinically indicated, a bone marrow biopsy.  
Patients will receive  the study regimen (BRiM) , approximately every 28 days for up 
to 6 cycles.  Patients will undergo clinical and laboratory evaluation on 
approximately Day 1, 8, 15 and 22 of Cycle -1 of therapy, and a on Day 1 and 15 of 
each subsequent cycle of treatment.   
Patients will undergo r adiographic assessment of response using a CT scan or a 
PET/CT scan after Cycle -3 and Cycle -6 of therapy. Bone marrow aspiration and 
biopsy may be performed after completion of therapy if indicated to confirm 
complete remission.  
Test Product, Dose, 
and Mode of Administration:  Commercially available preparation of bendamustine and rituximab will be used in 
this study, and administered as in general clinical practice. The drugs will be administered as outpatient, intravenously.  
VSCLI ( Marqibo® ) will be supplied as a single use, 3 -vial kit designed to enable 
entrapment of vincristine in liposomes at the time of use.   
Patients will receive Marqibo® at a patient -specific dose determined at the time of 
registration by the EWOC algorithm, from 1.8 mg/m2 up to the ceiling dose of 2.4 
mg/m2 (maximal actual dose given to any  study patient will be 2.3 mg/m2), as an 
intravenous infusion over 60 minutes on Day 2 of each cycle.

Criteria for 
Evaluation:  Dose -limiting toxicity (DLT)  will be defined as one of the following adverse 
reactions occurring during the first cycle of study therapy:  
• Grade 4 neutropenia (< 500/mm3) lasting  > 7 days  
• Grade 3 neutropenia (<1000/mm3) with fever or infection;  
BrUOG 326 Protocol       Version  Date: 5/1/2020  
6 • Grade 4 thrombocytopenia (<25,000/mm3);  
• Grade 3 thrombocytopenia (<50,000/mm3) requiring transfusion;  
• Grade 3 or 4 treatment -related non -hematologic toxicity, excluding:  
− Alopecia.  
− Grade 3 nausea or vomiting if corrected to ≤ grade 2 within 48 hours.  
− Grade 3 or 4 infusion reactions if occurring on Day 1  of Cycle 1 . 
• Delay of 2nd cycle of treatment for >14 days.  
Safety:  Adverse events and laboratory results will be summarized as proportions of patients 
experiencing toxicity. Toxicity will be graded according to the NCI CTCAE v4.0.  
Efficacy:  Response rate will be evaluated according to The Revised International Working 
Group Response Criteria for malignant lymphomas.  
Statistical Methods and Sample Size:  
 The primary endpoint  (Maximum tolerated dose, MTD)  will be defined as the dose 
level of Marqibo® in the BRiM combination, that when administered to a patient 
results in a probability of 33 % that a DLT will be manifest within the first cycle of 
treatment. For this purpose, consecutive patients wi ll be treated with BRiM 
chemotherapy using escalating doses of Marqibo®. Subjects will be enrolled in 
cohorts of N =1 (i.e. the next subject will be enrolled only after the DLT status of all 
previous subjects have been resolved and a new dose level assigned ). The dose 
escalation schema will use the Escalation With Overdose Control (EWOC) design 
and software—a Bayesian method permitting precise determination of the 
therapeutic working -dose while directly controlling the likelihood of an overdose. 
MTD will be determined after completion of the study using the EWOC algorithm. It
 will be calculated as the median of the marginal posterior distribution of the MTD, 
rounded to 0.05 mg/m2.  
The Marqibo® dose will be escalated from the starting dose (1.8 mg/m2). The 
maximum dose in the escalation scheme will be set at 2.4 mg/m2, but this dose is 
never actually administered to any patient . The maximum actual dose that might be 
administered in the absence of any DLT’s will be 2. 3 mg/m2.  
The trial will be terminated if the first three patients experience a DLT or 
anytime the posterior probability that the DLT rate at the minimum dose exceeds 0.33 is 0.8 or more. .  
The baseline rate of serious adverse events (SAE) with BR is assumed to be equal to 19% (as derived from the  
STiL phase III trial, Rummel et al., Lancet. 
2013;381(9873):1203- 10). The sample size of 10 subjects for the current study is 
chosen on the basis of a simulation of N =100 trials, assuming the target probability 
of DLT ( θ) of 33%, probability of exceeding target dose ( α) of 25% (with variable 
α increment of 5%), starting Marqibo® dose of 1.8 mg/m2, and maximal dose of 2.4 
mg/m2. The study will be able to correctly estimate the MTD in the range of 1.80 
mg/m2 to 2.20 mg/m2 with > 80% of patients treated at ±10% of the optimal dose.  
A simulation of N =500 trials with the above parameters, with sample size varying 
between 10 and 30, demonstrates that for the range of true MTD from 1.85 mg/m2 
to 2.20 mg/m2, trials with sample size of 10 will deliver a reasonably precise estimate  
of MTD according to the operating characteristics described in Section 1 6.

11 1. OBJECTIVES  
1.1 Primary Objectives  
• To establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose -limiting toxicity (DLT) of 
vincristine sulfate liposome injection (Marqibo®) in combination with bendamustine and 
rituximab (BRiM).  
• To establish the dose -limiting toxicities (DLT) of vincristine sulfate liposome injection 
(Marqibo®) in combination with bendamustine and rituximab (BRiM). 
1.2 Secondary Objectives  
• To evaluate cumulative rates of non- DLT toxicities during the six planned cycles of the 
BRiM combination in patients with indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma. 
• To evaluate tolerability, assessed by rate of completion of the planned six cycles of BRiM 
chemotherapy.  
• To evaluate response rate (RR) and complete response rate (CR) of the BRiM regimen in 
the study population of indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma patients.  
2. BACKGROUND  
2.1 Therapy of Mature B- Cell Non -Hodgkin Lymphomas 
Mature B -cell non- Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL) are a highly heterogeneous group of lymphoid 
malignancies, which comprise nearly 20 subtypes according to the most recent 2008 World Health Organi zation classification. They range from indolent lymphomas often managed by “watchful 
waiting” until symptomatic phase, to highly aggressive diseases associated with poor prognosis and immediate need for aggressive chemotherapy.
1 B-cell NHL is typically treated with 
chemotherapy in combination with the monoclonal antibody rituximab.  
The treatment in aggressive B -cell NHL, s uch as diffuse large B -cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is 
curative and most commonly involves the RCHOP regimen (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, 
doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone). In contrast, therapy in “indolent NHL”, which include, among else, follicular lymphoma (FL), mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), marginal zone lymphoma (MZL), lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma (LPL) and small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL), is geared towards achieving a partial or complete remission, although most patients experience further recurrences of the disease and are not cured. 
For decades, regimens utilizing the alkylating agent cyclophosphamide and vincristine, such as 
CHOP/RCHOP and CVP/RCVP, have been the mainstay of therapy for B -cell NHL. A number of 
randomized studies have established RCHO P as the standard treatment for DLBCL.
2-6 In indolent 
B-cell NHL, the acceptable front -line regimens included rituximab alone, RCHOP, RCVP and 
combinations of rituximab with fludarabine  ± mitoxantrone—depending on patient  characteristics, 
comorbidities and burden of the lymphoma.7-11 MCL is associated with poorer prognosis than other 
indolent NHLs and in recent trials more aggressive treatments  are investigated for this disease.12 
These regimens are typically prescribed for 6 to 8 cycles, delivered every 21 days, with additional chronic maintenance therapy
 using sing le-agent rituximab in FL.9 
2.2 Bendamustine -Rituximab: Standard Front -Line Therapy in Indolent NHL  
Bendamustine is an alkylating neoplastic agent. Rituximab is a monoclonal antibody against the 
CD20 molecule present on mature B -cells. In 2005 the combination of bendamustine with 
BrUOG 326 Protocol       Version  Date: 5/1/2020  
12 rituximab has shown high activity in relapsed/refractory indolent NHL (FL and MCL). In a phase 
II trial of 63 patients , Rummel et al. achieved an overall response rate of 90% and complete 
remission rate of 60%, with a median progression- free survival (PFS) of 24 months.13 This regimen 
was notable for its tolerability: non -hematologic toxicities were limited to grade 1 -2, with at 16% 
risk of grade 3/4 neutropenia, and only 3% rate of other grade 3- 4 hematologic toxicities. These 
results were confirmed in a North American phase II study , with an overall response of 92%, CR 
rate of 41%, PFS of 23 months and 36% rate of grade 3 -4 neutropenia and very rare non-
hematologic severe advers e events: febrile neutropenia 6%, infections 10%.14 The BR regimen is 
not associated with significant rates of peripheral neuropathy or ileus.  
Two subsequent large randomized trials have compared BR with RCHOP/RCVP as a front -line 
therapy in indolent NHL. The German Study Group for Indolent Lymphomas (StiL) trial  
randomized 549 patients with FL, MCL, MZL, LPL, SLL or other low -grade B -cell NHL (not 
otherwise specifie d, NOS) to 6 cycles of RCHOP or BR.15 At a median follow -up of 45 months, 
BR was associated with a significantly longer PFS (68.5 months vs 31.2 months, hazard ratio 0.58,  95% CI 0.44-0.74), and significantly improved CR rate (40% vs 30%), despite similar overall RR (93% vs 91%). The overall survival did not differ between the treatment groups. In the BRIGHT 
study , 487 patients with indolent NHL were randomized to RCHOP/RCVP or BR.
16 In this trial, 
BR was shown to be non -inferior to RCHO P/RCVP in the primary endpoint (CR, 31% vs 25%), 
as well as overall RR (97% vs 91%).  
In both studies, the toxicity of BR was significantly more favorable than that of RCHOP, and was 
generally quite manageable, with very low rates of non- hematologic grade 3- 4 toxicities. 
Moreover, BR was shown to improve patients’ quality of life better  than RCHOP/RCVP in the 
BRIGHT study .17

The results of those two randomized studies established BR as a standard front -line regimen in 
indolent B -cell lymphomas. Current US national guidelines from the National Comprehensive 
Cancer Network (NCCN  Guidelines®) for the management of indolent NHL recommend BR as a 
top category 1 front -line treatment  option for patients with FL (grade 1 -2), MCL (for patients 
requiring less aggressive therapy), disseminated non-gastric MZL, and LPL.18 
BrUOG 326 Protocol       Version  Date: 5/1/2020  
13 2.3 Combinations of Bendamustine (with or without Rituximab ) with Other Cytotoxic 
Agents, Including Vincrist ine 
Beca use of the excellent toxicity profile of BR, several studies have evaluated combinations of 
this regimen with additional chemotherapeutic agents. In a phase II study in 40 patients with MCL 
ineligible for more intense regimens , bendamustine (70 mg/m2 on Day 1, 2) with rituximab (375 
mg/m2 on Day 1)  and cytarabine (MTD of 800 mg/m2 on Day 2, 3, 4) showed acceptable tolerance, 
with reversible myelosupression as the principal toxicity: 12% rate of febrile neutropenia, transient 
grade 3 -4 thrombocytopenia in 87%, 35% rate of fatigue (5% grade 3), 15% rate of infection (12 
% grade 2 -3), 15% rate of rash, 10% rate of elevated transaminases (2% grad e 3) and 40% gamma -
glutamyltransferase elevation.19 This regimen was characterized by a highly encouraging 100% 
RR in previously untreated patients (80% in relapsed/refractory MCL). 
In relapsed/refractory indolent NHL, BR has been also combined with bortezomib—a proteasome inhibitor characterized by peripheral neuropathy and thrombocytopenia as the principal dose -
limiting toxicities.
20 The regimen of bendamustine (90 mg/m2 on Day 1 and 4), rituximab (375 
mg/m2 on Day 1) and full -dose bortezomib (1.3 mg/m2 on Day 1, 4, 8, 11) was administered to 30 
patients , and most non- hematologic adverse events were grade 1 -2 only with the rates of nausea 
50%, neuropathy 47%, fatigue 47%, constipation 40% and fever 40%. Eight patients (26%) experienced serious adverse effects, which included gr. 4 liver/renal failure, gr. 5 sepsis, gr.3 peripheral neuropathy, fatigue, hypotension, herpes zoster and dehydration (in 1 or 2 cases each). This toxic ity was deemed acceptable to proceed with a randomized study of BR with 
BR+bortezomib (
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]). Another US phase II study (VE RTICAL trial)  of bortezomib 
and BR in 73 patients with relapsed/refractory FL also showed limited toxicity, with dose escalation of bendamustine from 50 mg/m
2 to 90 mg/m2 (on Day 1, 2) without reaching the MTD.21 
The overall rate of  ≥ grade 3 toxicities was 77%, with 34% patients experiencing an SAE. The rates of grade 3 -4 toxicities were: neutropenia 25%, thrombocytopenia 14%, fatigue 12%, diarrhea 
12%, neuropathy 11%, vomiting 8%, nausea 7%. The overall rate of peripheral neuropathy was 44%, constipation 45% and fever 34%. 
Bendamustine had been previously combined with vincristine and prednisone  and compared with 
an analogous regimen of cyclophosphamide, vincristine and prednisone in a phase III trial conducted in Germany in 2006—as a front -line therapy for patients with indolent NHL.
22 The 
schedule of bendamustine in this trial differed from currently used standards (60 mg/m2 on Day 1, 
2, 3, 4 and 5—total 300 mg/m2 per cycle). The dose of vincristine was 2 mg (Day 1) and was not 
weight - or BSA -adjusted. The toxicity profile of this regimen was as follows: grade 3 -4 leukopenia 
in 19%, anemia in 10%, thrombocytopenia 4%, infection 2% (all grades: 14%), peripheral neuropathy 1.2% (all grades: 35%), constipation 0.8% (all grades: 10%). The protocol  initially 
specified bendamustine at 70 mg/m
2 for 5 days (total dose per cycle 350 mg/m2), which was 
reduced after enrollment of the first 25 patients because of significant thrombocytopenia. There were no significant differences between those two arms in the rate of RR, CR, although PFS favored the bendamustine- based combination. 
Those results suggest that BR can be safely combined with other cytotoxic agents that may cause peripheral neuropathy or myelosupression, including vincristine sulfate. 
2.4 Vincristin e Sulfate  
Vincristine sulfate (22 -oxovincaleukoblastine) is an alkaloid antineoplastic agent derived from the 
periwinkle plant ( Vinca rosea  Linn.), with a high activity against lymphoid neoplasms. Vincristine 
BrUOG 326 Protocol       Version  Date: 5/1/2020  
14 is a cell -cycle -specific agent which causes mit otic arrest in the M -phase by binding tubulin, a 
protein component of microtubules, and disrupting cell division. Vincristine sulfate is a significant 
component of some of the most active chemotherapy regimens for NHL, including RCVP, RCHOP or DA -EPOCH. It  is also an essential component of treatment in high -grade lymphoid 
malignancies such as acute lymphoblastic leukemia and lymphoblastic lymphoma. Vincristine is metabolized primarily by the liver and excreted in the bile and feces. E limination half -life in  adults 
varies widely between 164 and 5100 minutes, depending on the assay, dose and rate of administration.
23 
The dose- limiting toxicity of vincristine sulfate is neurological.23,24 In its most common form it is 
dose- dependent, symmetrical, and manifests as peripheral sensory and motor neuropathy. It can 
be classified as early —within 1 week of administration (decreased deep tendon reflexes, jaw or 
thigh pain, ileus), intermediate —within 2 -3 weeks (paresthesiae,  sensory loss, constipation, 
bladder dysfunction, hyponatremia related to the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone), and late—beyond 3 weeks: foot/wrist drop, postural hypotension and erectile dysfunction, ophthalmoplegia, dysphagia. Cranial nerve damage or encephalopathy are rare. Distal neuropathy may progress to severe pain, weakness, gait disturbance, motor and sensory impairment. Vincristine -induced  neuropathy is generally reversible although recovery may take months and is 
often incomplete.  Because the toxicity was historically seen particularly in children treated with 
high doses (1.5- 2.0 mg/m
2 weekly), the dose of vincristine sulfate is typically capped at total 2 mg 
per dose in all currently used regimens.25 
Other toxicities associated with vincristine sulfate are rare and include alopecia, hyponatremia, constipation and colicky abdominal pain. These reflect a vincristine -induced autonomic nervous 
system dysfunction . Fatal adynamic ileus has been rarely observed. Vincristine sulfate is a vesicant 
and its extravasation can result in painful local inflammation. At conventional vincristine sulfate doses, myelosuppression is uncommon. 
2.5 Vincristine Sulfate Liposome Injection (VSLI, Marqibo® ) 
Marqibo® (vincristine sulfate liposomes injection) is vincristine encapsulated in 
sphingomyelin/cholesterol liposomes. The lipid components in the liposome are sphingomy elin 
and cholesterol at a molar ratio of approximately 60:40 (mol:mol). Marqibo® was developed to improve activity, therapeutic index and pharmacokinetic profile of vincristine sulfate.
26,27 Clinical 
pharmacokinetic studies have shown it to be a long -circulating, slow release formulation, which 
in adults is characterized by an initial 3 to 12 hours delay in clearance after administration. This results in total vincristine levels that remain relatively constant before declining with time. It contributes significantly to the greater plasma exposure of total vincristine that is observed after administration of Marqibo® as compared to vincristine sulfate. The pharmacokinetics  of total 
vincristine was not altered significantly after repeated dosing of Marqibo® up to 3 cycles (2.0 mg/m2 every 2 weeks=1 cycle). Liposomal encapsulation of vincristine sulfate does not alter its route of excretion from the body which is primarily biliary/fecal with urinary elimination 
comprising a minor pathway. Marqibo® has been administered to 809 subjects in 20 studies and 2 compassionate use programs since program initiation. It is currently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for use at a dose of 2.25 mg/m
2 weekly in adults with Philadelphia 
chromosome- negative acute lymphoblastic leukemia in second or greater relapse or whose disease 
has progressed following two or more anti- leukemia therapies.  
BrUOG 326 Protocol       Version  Date: 5/1/2020  
15 2.5.1 Pharmacokinetics 
The pharmacokinetics of Marqibo® was examined in a series of 7 clinical studies in adults with 
various solid and hematologic tumors, in hepatically impaired subjects, and in children with 
various tumors. The data are consistent and show that vincristine is retained in the plasma encapsulated in the liposomes for extended periods after administration of Marqibo®
.28 Released 
vincristine is undetectable at most time  points in all patients for whom this was evaluated. 
Therefore, the total vincristine measured in plasma reflects liposomally encapsulated drug that may not be immediately bioavailable and may not be directly co mparable to plasma levels of 
vincristine after administration of standard vincristine sulfate injection, which provides the drug in an immediately bioavailable form. Interpatient variability is high; however plasma clearance profiles for individual patients are consistent upon repeated exposure to Marqibo®. No drug accumulation in plasma is apparent upon repeated exposure with a 14 day interval. No consistent change in AUC or clearance was observed between Cycles 1 and 3 of treatment at 2.0 mg/m
2 every 
14 days. Following IV administration of Marqibo®, urinary excretion was a minor route of elimination for vincristine and a metabolite, N -desformylvincristine. Less than 8% of the 
administered dose was eliminated in urine over the 96 hour observation period. Total vincristine clearance and plasma exposure (AUC
inf) did not appear to be influenced by gender, age, BSA, or 
cancer type. 
2.5.2 Efficacy and toxicity as a single agent in NHL  
In a phase I study  of 25 patients with various solid tumors, the maximum tolerated dose of 
Marqibo® was established at 2.4 mg/m2 every 3 weeks and the recommended phase II dose was 
2.0 mg/m2.29 Myalgias and constipation were the DLT at the dose of 2.8 mg/m2. Early 
hypersensitivity with transient fever was reported in 60% of patients during the first infusion. Altogether in this study the rates of grade 3 -4 toxicities were: constipation 12%, alopecia 8%, 
fatigue 8%, anemia 8%, other at 4%: nausea, neuropathy,  fever, pain, myalgias, leukopenia, 
neutropenia (grade 4), and thrombocytopenia. 
Sarris et al . studied Marqibo® as a single -agent at the dose of 2.0 mg/m2 every 14 days in 51 
patients with relapsed NHL, all of whom had pre- existing grade 1 -2 neuropathy.30 They observed 
no grade 3 -4 nausea, vomiting, stomatitis, ileus, obstipation or hematologic toxicities. 31% of 
patients experienced worsening of neuropathy to grade 3, but it improved in all patients within weeks of discontinuation of Ma rqibo®. Febrile neutropenia occurred in 6% of patients, all of 
whom had a pre -existing neutropenia. Responses were seen in 41% of patients, particularly in 
aggressive or transformed NHL. Rodriguez et al . reported a phase II study of single -agent 
Marqibo® (2.0 mg/m2 every 2 weeks) in 119 patients with refractory aggressive NHL (primarily 
DLBCL).31 They observed a 25% RR, with very limited toxicities and predominantly grade 1/2 
adverse events, 24% rate of dose modifications and 20% rate of dose delays. Neuropathy was the predominant reason for treatment discontinuation or dose modification. Grade 3/4 neuropathy occurred in 32%, all of whom  had baseline grade 2 neuropathy. Other grade 3/4 toxicities included: 
gastrointestinal (11%), dyspnea (5%), fatigue (7%), fever (2%), constipation (3%), pain (7%), weakness (18%), anemia (15%), neutropenia (27%), thrombocytopenia (12% ). 
Single -agent Marqibo® was extensively studied as a treatment for refractory ALL. In a Phase II 
trial of Marqibo® at 2.0 mg/m2 every 2 weeks, the RR was 14%.32 The non- hematologic toxicity 
was minimal in that study, with two cases (12%) of grade 1 peripheral neuropathy, grade 2 orthostasis and headaches. Subsequently, 65 adults with relapsed/refractory Philadelphia -negative 
BrUOG 326 Protocol       Version  Date: 5/1/2020  
16 ALL were treated with high -dose Marqibo® at 2.25 mg/m2 weekly in a pivotal phase II trial , which 
demonstrated a 35% RR.33 At this dose 86% of patients had a neuropathy -associated adverse 
effect, with 39% experiencing at least one ≥ grade 3 event, most commonly neuropathy -related 
(23%), constipation or abdominal pain (6%), fatigue, asthenia or fever (aggregate 8%). The rates 
of hematologic grade 3/4 adverse effects were: neutropenia 16%, anemia 5%, thrombocytopenia 7%, febrile neutropenia 3%. 
2.5.3 Combinations with rituxim ab and/or cytotoxic agents 
Marqibo® has been used in combination with rituximab and with RCHOP -like regimen in B -cell 
NHL, without signals of increased or unexpected toxicities. Kaplan et al. combined Marqibo® at 2.0 mg/m2 every 2 weeks with rituximab 375 mg/m2 in 22 patients with relapsed/refractory DLBCL or MCL in need of palliative therapy, reporting an overall RR of 59%, including 27% CR.
34 The toxicity profile was consistent with single -agent experience for Marqibo® (Table 2). 
Hagemeister et al. used Marqibo® 2.0 mg/m2 as a substit ute for vincristine sulfate in the RCHOP 
regimen (with standard doses of rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin and prednisone, every 21 days) for untreated DLBCL.
35 This RCHMP regimen achieved a 96% response rate with 90% 
CR rate. The safety profile was not different than what would be expected with RCHOP in this population (Table 2).  
These two studies indicate that Marqibo® can be safely combined with rituximab and full -dose 
alkylating agents for the treatment of NHL, without unexpected toxicities.

2.6 Rationale for the BRiM combination  
The front -line therapy of indolent B -cell NHL has shifted from combinations of cyclophosphamide 
and vincristine (RCHOP, RCVP) to the alkylator -only regimen (BR), which has superior efficacy, 
but does not benefit from synergy of alkylating and microtubule -disrupting agents which are 
characterized by different mechanisms of action. Although bendamustine is a superior alkylating 
agent compared with cyclophosphamide, it has not advanced to therapy of aggressive lymphomas because of the need to safely introduce it into multi -agent regimens necessary for the cure of 
DLBCL. There is thus an unmet need for a bendamustine -based multi- agent chemotherapy 
combination that could incrementally improve therapy of indolent NHL and provide a backbone for novel curative regimens in DLBCL. Considering non- overlapping toxicities, BR -vincristine 
combination is a natural choice for this goal, reflecting the synergy utilized in  
cyclophosphamide/vincristine combinations. Marqibo®, a novel liposomal formulation allowing 
for improved pharmacokinetics and efficacy of vincristine sulfate, is a promising agent that could be combined with BR, potentially enhancing the effects of this regimen without additional toxicity.  
In front -line therapy of indolent B -cell NHL, BR provides 30- 40% rate of complete remission.
16 
The augmented regimen may be particularly beneficial for patients with indolent B -cell NHL who 
are classified as higher -risk. At  present, patients with indolent NHL are treated as a homogeneous 
group with the standard BR regimen. However in FL significant heterogeneity in prognosis is recognized, captured by clinical prognostic scores such as FLIPI and FLIPI -2.
36-38 About 27% of 
patients with FL can be classified as high -risk FLIPI -2 and these patients experience a PFS rate of 
only about 50% at 3 years and 19% at 5 years with standard therapy.37 An addition of a highly 
active agent such as Marqibo® to the front -line chemoimmunotherapy regimen may improve 
outcomes in this group without compromising safety. 
BR has also been widely used as a front -line therapy for patients with MCL who are ineligible for 
more aggressive strategies.15 However, MCL remains difficult to treat, with >50% of patients 
experiencing relapse within 3 years. Although the addition of cytarabine to BR  may improve 
response rates and potentially duration of remission, it is associated with significantly increased 
toxicity (despite a lower dose of bendamustine, 70 mg/m2), particularly thrombocytopenia  
requiring transfusion (65% of cycles) which prevented any dose escalation in the trial.19 BRiM 
may offer a more tolerable alternative in this disease.

18 3. PATIENT  ELIGIBILITY  
3.1 Eligibility Criteria  
3.1.1 Documentation of disease. 
Patients must have histologically confirmed indolent B- cell non -Hodgkin lymphoma, 
CD20 -positive, previously treated or untreated—for which bendamustine -rituximab 
chemotherapy is clinically indicated; the following subtypes are allowed : 
− Follicular  lymphoma 
− Mantle cell  lymphoma,  
− Marginal zone lymphoma,  
− Small lymphocytic  lymphoma,  
− Lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma, or 
− Indolent B-cell lymphoma, NOS .  
BrUOG must receive the pathology report to confirm the diagnosis and the CD20-positive 
status, as well as documentation from the treating physician that bendamustine -rituximab 
chemotherapy is clinically indicated for the subject.  
3.1.2 Radiological  measurable disease, defined as any measurable lesion >1 5 mm on the staging 
CT or PET/CT. Patients with blood or bone marrow involvement only are ineligible. 
Splenomegaly is acceptable as a measurable site if enlarged on the initial CT scan  (>13 cm 
in the cranio -caudal dimension). 
3.1.3 Previous treatment for lymphoma is allowed, with the exception of use of bendamustine within 180 days of the date of the consent form, or any prior use of vincristine sulfate 
liposome injection (Marqibo®).  
3.1.4 Age ≥ 18 years.   
3.1.5 ECOG performance status 0 or 1 (see Appendix A
). 
3.1.6 Life expectancy of greater than  6 months.

19 3.1.8 Prevention of pregnancy. 
The effects of bendamustine and vincristine on the developing human fetus are unknown.  
For this reason and because Class D agents (bendamustine, vincristine) are known to be teratogenic, women and men of child- bearing potential must agree to use adequate 
contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence ; vasectomy ) prior 
to study entry and up to 4 months after the last dose of study treatment.  
3.1.9 Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy t est 
within 14 days prior to first treatment on study (Cycle 1, Day 1). Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in 
this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.   Postmenopausal 
women (after surgical menopause or no menses for >12 months) do not need to have a pregnancy status, but their postmenopausal status must be documented.  
3.1.10 Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document. The patient must be aware of the neoplastic nature of his/her disease and must willingly consent after being informed of the procedure to be followed, the experimental nature of the therapy, alternatives, potential benefits, side effects, risks, and discomforts.  
3.2 Exclusion Criteria  
3.2.1 History of any allergic reaction attributed to rituximab  (with the exception of <grade 3 
infusion reaction), bendamustine, vincristine sulfate, Marqibo®, mannitol, sodium phosphate injection or sphingomyelin/cholesterol liposome. 
3.2.2 Patients who have had any lymphoma -directed radiotherapy, chemotherapy, biologic or 
experimental therapy, oral or intravenous, within 4 weeks (6 weeks for nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study or those who have not recovered from adverse events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier to ≤grade 1— with the 
exception of alopecia, which is allowed. 
3.2.3 Any prior treatment with vincristine sulfate liposome injection (Marqibo®).  
3.2.4 Prior treatment with bendamustine or vincristine sulfate within 180 days of enrollment. Prior treatment with rituximab is allowed.  
3.2.5 Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents  or anti- cancer therap y with 
the exception of endocrine therapy for breast or prostate cancer . 
3.2.6 Patients with known central nervous system involvement (infiltration of the brain, meninges or cerebrospinal fluid) by the lymphoma are excluded from this clinical trial 
because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events. 
3.2.7 Active peripheral sensory or motor neuropathy > grade 1. This is defined by the CTCAE as any neuropathy requiring intervention or limiting instrumental activities of daily life.  
3.2.8 History of demyelinating form of Charcot- Marie -Tooth syndrome, acquired 
demyelinating disorders, or other demyelinating condition.

BrUOG 326 Protocol       Version  Date: 5/1/2020  
20 3.2.10 Patients receiving any medications or substances that are strong inhibitors or inducers of 
CYP 3A enzyme are ineligible.  See Appendix B for the list of prohibited drugs. 
Note : Dexamethasone use as an anti -emetic according to the protocol is allowed. 
As part  of the enrollment/informed consent procedures, the patient will be counseled on 
the risk of interactions with other agents, and what to do if new medications need to be prescribed  or if the patient is considering a new over -the- counter medicine or herbal 
product. Grapefruit  juice in particular has significant undesirable interactions.    
3.2.11 Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection  
(that requires antibiotic use  which is not prophylactic ), symptomatic congestive heart 
failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.  In cases of uncertainty, the treating 
physician will request a review by BrUOG to decide w hether an illness is considered 
prohibitive (planning should be used as review can take multiple days) . Suppressive 
antiviral therapy with acyclovir, famciclovir, or valacyclovir for herpes simples or herpes zoster is allowed.  
3.2.12 Prisoners . 
3.2.13 Pregnant or breast -feeding women.  
Pregnant women are excluded from this study because bendamustine and vincristine are 
Class D agents with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects.  Based on its mechanism of action and findings from animal studies, Marqibo® c an cause fetal harm 
when administered to pregnant women. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with bendamustine and/or vincristine, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with either agent. These potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this study. 
3.2.14 Known Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) or active Hepatitis B infection (defined as presence of HBV DNA or hepatitis B S antigen in the blood).  
HIV-positive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of the 
potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with Marqibo®. In addition, these patients are 
at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with marrow -suppressive therapy. 
Patients with active hepatitis B infection are included because of high risk of disease worsening during treatment with rituximab.  
3.2.15 Any prior or active cancer, which in the opinion of the investigator would preclude safe 
participation in this study.  
3.3 Inclusion of Women and Minorities  
Both men and women of all races and ethnic groups are eligible for this trial.

21 4. TREATMENT 
4.1 Agent Administration  
Patient must start protocol treatment within 7 days of registration on the study. Treatment 
will be delivered in 28- day courses, for no more than 6 cycles. In case of a holiday  or other 
extenuat ing circumstances , Cycle 2 -6 treatment may be initiated up to 1 day before or up to 5 days 
after that date (ie. on Day 27 to Day 33 of the cycle), provided that all Section 4.2  criteria are met.  
Other delays related  to toxicity as provisioned in the protocol are allowed. No investigational or 
commercial agents or therapies other than those described below may be administered with the intent to treat the patient's malignancy.

The following criteria must be met by Day 1 of a new cycle to initiate therapy:  
− absolute neutrophil count≥1,000/mm3 If ANC is <1,500/mm3 refer to section 5.1 and 
hold treatment if deemed related to study treatment.  
− platelets≥75,000/mm3 (without a transfusion within 1 week) 
− recovery from all non- hematologic toxicities (excluding alopecia and weight 
gain/loss) related to any of the agents administered on the protocol to <grade 2, or to 
patient’s baseline grade prior to starting therapy on protocol.  
Grade 2 toxicity that is continuing from baseline or is non- treatment related is allowed.   
BrUOG 326 Protocol       Version  Date: 5/1/2020  
22 Any patient who experiences a DLT during cycle 1 must come off study.  
4.3 Ancillary Therapy  
4.3.1 Hematopoietic Growth Factors  
Patients who meet criteria for primary prophylaxis of febrile neutropenia set by the American 
Society of Clinical Oncology may receive subcutaneous pegfilgrastim 6 mg on Day 3 or Day 4 of the treatment cycle, at least 24 hours after administration of study therapy.
39 The high- risk factors 
that need to be considered when evaluating patient’s risk for febrile neutropenia include: age (>65 years), poor performance or poor nutritional status, history of febrile neutropenia, open wounds or active infection, extensive prior  treatment, cytopenias due to bone marrow involvement by tumor 
and other serious comorbidities. All patients >65 years old  treated in this study protocol should 
receive primary prophylaxis with pegfilgrastim on Day 3, 4 or 5 of the cycle.  
Patients with ne utropenic fever or infection must be hospitalized promptly for intravenous 
antibiotic therapy and may receive myeloid growth factors as appropriate.  
Erythropoie sis-stimulating agents such as epoetin alfa or darbepoetin alfa may not  be used during 
study treatment.  
4.3.2 Blood and Platelet Transfusion 
Transfusions will be used at the Investigator’s clinical judgment. Red blood cell transfusions may be administered prophylactically for hemoglobin <8.0 g/dL or in case of severe symptomatic anemia. Platelet transfusions may be administered prophylactically for platelet counts ≤10,000 
/mm
3 or therapeutically for low platelet counts. 
4.3.3 Infections  
Patients in this study will not receive any pre -specified infectious prophylaxis. In case of grade 4 
neutropenia (ANC<500/mm3), a prophylactic quinolone (ciprofloxacin 500 mg twice daily, 
levofloxacin 500 mg daily or moxifloxacin 400 mg daily) may be prescribed to prevent febrile neutropenia.  
Patients with history of herpes simplex or herpes zoster on suppressive therapy with acyclovir, 
famciclovir or valacyclovir may  (but do not need to)  continue therapy during the treatment on 
study.  
The concurrent administration of itraconazole with vincristine increases onset and severity of neuromuscular adverse effect s of vincristine. If antifungal therapy is required during study 
treatment, alternative anti -fungals should be evaluated prior to considering any azoles.   
4.4 Prior and Concomitant Medications 
The Investigator will be permitted to prescribe  other treatment(s)  at his or her discretion. These 
treatments , including any transfusions or prophylactic therapies, must be recorded on the CRF. 
However, any other standard or investigational treatments for lymphoma are not allowed. If such treatment is deemed necessary, t he patient must discontinue treatment on this study.  
Medications known to interact with cytochrome P450- 3A4 isoenzymes and/or P -glycoprotein are 
either prohibited (see Section 3.2, Exclusion Criteria
), or should be administered with caution. 
A list of these medications can be found in Appendix B. Close monitoring is recommended for 
BrUOG 326 Protocol       Version  Date: 5/1/2020  
23 subjects taking agents with narrow therapeutic indices and metabolized by the liver, such as 
warfarin, quinidine, and digoxin. 
All medications and supportive therapy that are administered within 14 days prior to the start of 
study drug administration through 30 days after the last dose of study treatment , including the start 
and stop date(s), dose/amount administered, and indication, must be recorded in the source documents and in the subject’s CRF. This includes any transfusions or prophylactic treatments. 
4.5 Duration of Therapy 
In the absence of treatment delays due to adverse event (s), treatment will continue for 6 cycles or 
until one of the following criteria applies: 
• Occurrence of a DLT in the first cycle of treatment,  
• Disease progression,  
• The need for administration of therapy for lymphoma not specified in the protocol; this 
includes any form of chemotherapy, radiation therapy or biologic therapy; 
• Intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of treatment,  
• Adverse event(s)  deemed unacceptable by the patient or the treating physici an, 
• Patient decides to withdraw from the study  for any reason , or 
• General or specific changes in the patient's condition render the patient unacceptable for further treatment in the judgment of the investigator.  
5. DOSE
 MODIFICATIONS  AND  MANAGEMENT  OF TOXICITY 
All subjects must meet Criteria to initiate the next cycle according to Section 4.2  before receiving 
a next cycle of therapy.  
If a toxicity -related treatment delay  is needed , the cycle should be delayed by up to 8 days. In case 
of delay exceeding 14 days, the patient must discontinue the study treatment. Further therapy for the lymphoma will be at the discretion of the treating physician.  
There will be no dose modifications for rituximab in this study.  Dose modifications for 
bendamustine and Marqibo® will conform to the following dose levels: 
Dose level  Dose  
Bendamustine  Marqibo®  
0 90 mg/m2 100% patient-assigned dose 
-1 50 mg/m2 75% patient-assigned dose 
-2 25 mg/m2 50% patient-assigned dose 
Once a dose is reduced, it may  not be re -escalated during the study treatment. Patients requiring 
>2 dose reductions must go off protocol therapy. 
The following guidelines apply to any toxicities attributed to treatment  (understood as any agent 
administered on protocol) . Baseline or disease -related toxicities will be managed according to the 
treating physician’s recommendations.

BrUOG 326 Protocol       Version  Date: 5/1/2020  
25 In case of grade 3 or 4 chemotherapy -induced nausea or vomiting, an aggressive outpatient or 
inpatient therapy with intravenous fluids, electrolyte replacement and anti -emetics should be 
instituted. If the nausea and/or vomiting resolve to grade 1 -2 within  48 hours, such an event will 
not be considered a DLT. 
5.4 Constipation 
Severe constipation may develop in subjects who receive Marqibo®. Decreased bowel motility 
due to intrabdominal disease, hypercalcemia, dehydration , use of opioids  can also contribute to 
constipation. A diet high in bulk fiber, fruits and vegetables, and adequate fluid intake may help 
minimize constipation. All patients treated in this study should receive education on prophylactic bowel regimen. A suggested bowel regimen is as follows: 
1. Prophylactic laxatives  
a. Senna at bedtime (1 -2 tablets, dose varies with the preparation), or  
b. Milk of Magnesia, 30 mL at bedtime  
2. If no bowel movement with the above, add: 
a. Lactulose, 20 gram (30 mL) up to 3 times a day , or 
b. Polyethylene glycol 3350 powder (MiraLax®) 17 gram dissolved in 4- 8 oz. of 
water, once daily by mouth, or 
c. Biscodyl, 5 to 15 mg tablet by mouth or one 10 mg suppository, at bedtime.

6.1 Dose -Limiting Toxicity (Definition)  
Dose -limiting toxicity (DLT)  will be defined  as one of the following AEs occurring during Cycle 
1 of study therapy  (with a final determination on Day  1 of Cycle  2), after administration of any 
study medication listed in Section 4.1 : 
• Grade 4 neutropenia (< 500/mm3) lasting  > 7 days  
• Grade 3 neutropenia (<1000/mm3) with fever or infection; 
• Grade 4 thrombocytopenia (<25,000/mm3); 
• Grade 3 thrombocytopenia (<50,000/mm3) requiring transfusion; 
• Grade 3 or 4 treatment -related non- hematologic toxicity, excluding:  
− Alopecia.  
− Grade 3 nausea or vomiting if corrected to ≤ grade 2 within 48 hours.  
− Grade 3 or 4 infusion reactions if occurring on Day 1 of the first cycle . 
− Grade 3 or 4 electrolyte ( sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium, chloride, 
phosphorus) abnormality, unless corrected to <grade 2 within 48 hours. 
• Delay of 2nd cycle of treatment for >14 days. 
Any patient who experiences a DLT must come off study.  The trial will be terminated  if the 
first three patients experience a DLT or anytime the posterior probabilit y that the DLT 
rate at the minimum dose exceeds 0.33 is 0.8 or more. Toxicities occurring prior to 
administration of any study medications will not be considered DLT.  
6.2 Disease Assessments 
For the purpose of the study, the disease will be assessed and tumor measurements performed at three time points: 
• During pre -treatment period, within 42 days prior to registration  (Section 8.1
) 
• After Cycle -3 chemotherapy, between Day-22 and Day-28 of the cycle  
• After Cycle -6 chemotherapy (or the last treatment, if therapy is discontinued earlier) . 
CT scan is not required for patients who terminate study therapy early and have received fewer 
than 3 cycles of treatment, or had restaging CT scan within 1 month prior to discontinuation of study therapy.  
For patients who undergo a pre-treatment staging bone marrow evaluation, the procedure must be repeated if complete remission (CR) is assigned as the final tumor response. A repeat procedure is not necessary otherwise. Any assessment  for disease that is  performed between the date of 
informed consent signature and off- study assessment date must be submitted to BrUOG.  
6.3 Off Study Assessment  
The patient will undergo Off Study Assessment during a visit scheduled between Day 30 and Day 
42 of the last cycle of study treatment  they receive . The visit will entail the following evaluations: 
• History and physical examination, including vital signs, ECOG performance status, weight , 
BSA, and concomitant medication log.  
• Toxicity grading  assessment, including determination of all cumulative toxicities for the 
purpose of the study. 
BrUOG 326 Protocol       Version  Date: 5/1/2020  
29 • Assessment of final response to treatment using the International Working Group Revised 
Response Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma (see Section 7.1)41. This assessment should be 
finalized after the results of disease assessment tests become available.  
7. RESPONSE  ASSESSMENT  
Although response is not the primary endpoint of this trial, patients with measurable disease will be assessed by standard International Working Group criteria for Malignant Lymphomas
, as 
revised in 2007.41  
Patients will be assessed for response to treatment after Cycle 3 and Cycle 6 of therapy on study  
(see Section 6.2). Earlier assessment may be performed in case of suspected clinical progression of disease. A CT scan or a PET -CT scan can be used for r esponse assessment in this study, 
according to Investigator’s preference guided by the histologic subtype of the lymphoma. For the purpose of study evaluation, all relevant measurable nodal and extranodal sites of disease ≥1 cm in size should be recorded in the baseline scan and followed until resolution. If CT is utilized for response assessment, it should be performed with IV contrast unless there is a documented contraindication (such as chronic kidney disease or hypersensitivity to contrast agent). 
7.1 Definitions of response  
7.1.1 Complete remission  
1. Complete disappearance of all detectable clinical evidence of disease and disease- related 
symptoms if present before therapy. 
2. FDG -avid lymphoma: in patients with no pretreatment PET scan or when the PET scan was 
posit ive before therapy, a post -treatment residual mass of any size is permitted as long as it is 
PET negative.  
3. Variably FDG -avid lymphomas/FDG avidity unknown: in patients without a pretreatment PET 
scan, or if a pretreatment PET scan was negative, all lymph n odes and nodal masses must have 
regressed on CT to normal size (≤ 1.5 cm in their greatest transverse diameter for nodes > 1.5 
cm before therapy). Previously involved nodes that were 1.1 to 1.5 cm in their long axis and more than 1.0 cm in their short axis before treatment must have decreased to ≤ 1.0 cm in their short axis after treatment.  
4. The spleen and/or liver, if considered enlarged before therapy on the basis of a physical examination or CT scan, should not be palpable on physical examination and should be considered normal size by imaging studies, and nodules related to lymphoma should disappear. However, determination of splenic involvement is not always reliable because a spleen considered normal in size may still contain lymphoma, whereas an enlarged spleen may reflect variations in anatomy, blood volume, the use of hematopoietic growth factors, or causes other than lymphoma. 
5. If the bone marrow was involved by lymphoma before treatment, the infiltrate must have cleared on repeat bone marrow biopsy. The biopsy sample on which this determination is made must be adequate (with a goal of > 20 mm unilateral core). If the sample is indeterminate by morphology, it should be negative by immunohistochemistry. A sample that is negative by immunohistochemistry but that demonstrates a small population of clonal lymphocytes by flow 
cytometry will be considered a CR.  
BrUOG 326 Protocol       Version  Date: 5/1/2020  
30 7.1.2 Partial remission  
1. At least a 50% decrease in sum of the product of the diameters (SPD) of up to six of the largest 
dominant nodes or nodal masses. These nodes or masses should be selected according to all of the following: they should be clearly measurable in at least 2 perpendicular dimensions; if possible they should be from disparate regions of the body; and they should include mediastinal and retroperitoneal areas of disease whenever these sites are involved.  
2. No increase should be observed in the size of other nodes, liver, or spleen. 
3. Splenic and hepatic nodules must regress by ≥ 50% in their SPD or, for single nodules, in the greatest transverse diameter.  
4. With the exception of splenic and hepatic nodules, involvement of other organs is usually assessable and no measurable disease should be present.  
5. Bone marrow assessment is irrelevant for determination of a PR if the sample was positive before tre atment. However, if positive, the cell type should be specified (eg, large -cell 
lymphoma or small neoplastic B cells). Patients who achieve a CR by the above criteria, but who have persistent morphologic bone marrow involvement will be considered partial responders. 
6. When the bone marrow was involved before therapy and a clinical CR was achieved, but with no bone marrow assessment after treatment, patients should be considered partial responders. 
7. No new sites of disease should be observed. 
8. Typically FDG -avid lymphoma: for patients with no pretreatment PET scan or if the PET scan 
was positive before therapy, the post -treatment PET should be positive in at least one 
previously involved site. 
9. Variably FDG -avid lymphomas/FDG -avidity unknown: for patients without a pretreatment 
PET scan, or if a pretreatment PET scan was negative, CT criteria should be used.  
10. In patients with follicular lymphoma or mantle -cell lymphoma, a PET scan is only indicated 
with one or at most two residual masses that have regressed by more than 50% on CT; those with more than two residual lesions are unlikely to be PET negative and should be considered partial responders. 
7.1.3 Stable disease 
1. A patient is considered to have SD when he or she fails to attain the criteria needed for a CR or PR, but does not fulfill those for progressive disease. 
2. Typically FGD -avid lymphomas: the PET should be positive at prior sites of disease with no 
new areas of involvement on the post- treatment CT or PET.  
3. Variably FDG -avid lymphomas/FDG -avidity unknown: for patients without a pretreatment 
PET scan or if the pretreatment PET was negative, there must be no change in the size of the previous lesions on the post- treatment CT scan.  
7.1.4 Progressive disease  
Lymph nodes should be considered abnormal if the long axis is more than 1.5 cm regardless of the short axis. If a lymph node has a long axis of 1.1 to 1.5 cm, it should only be considered abnormal if its short axis is more than 1.0. Lymph nodes ≤ 1.0 × ≤ 1.0 cm will not be considered as abnormal 
BrUOG 326 Protocol       Version  Date: 5/1/2020  
31 for progressive disease.  
1. Appearance of any new lesion more than 1.5 cm in any axis during or at the end of therapy, 
even if other lesions are decreasing in size. Increased FDG uptake in a previously unaffected 
site should only be considered relapsed or progressive disease after confi rmation with other 
modalities. In patients with no prior history of pulmonary lymphoma, new lung nodules identified by CT are mostly benign. Thus, a therapeutic decision should not be made solely on the basis of the PET without histologic confirmation. 
2. At least a 50% increase from nadir in the SPD of any previously involved nodes, or in a single 
involved node, or the size of other lesions (eg, splenic or hepatic nodules). To be considered progressive disease, a lymph node with a diameter of the short axis of less than 1.0 cm must increase by ≥ 50% and to a size of 1.5 × 1.5 cm or more than 1.5 cm in the long axis. 
3. At least a 50% increase in the longest diameter of any single previously identified node more than 1 cm in its short axis. 
Lesions should be PET positive if observed in a typical FDG -avid lymphoma or the lesion was 
PET positive before therapy unless the lesion is too small to be detected with current PET systems (< 1.5 cm in its long axis by CT).

33 9.1 Rituximab (IDEC -C2B8) 
9.1.1 Product description 
Rituximab is a CD20 -directed chimeric monoclonal antibody. It is indicated for treatment of: 
relapsed or refractory, low- grade or follicular, CD20 -positive, B -cell NHL as a single agent; 
previously untreated follicular, CD20- positive, B -cell NHL in combination with first line 
chemotherapy and as single- agent maintenance therapy; non -progressing (including stable 
disease) , low -grade, CD20- positive, B -cell NHL as a single agent after first -line CVP 
chemotherapy; and previously untreated diffuse large B- cell, CD20 -positive NHL in combination 
with CHOP or other anthracycline- based chemotherapy regimens.  
A comprehensive produc t information and list of adverse effects is available in the Rituxan® 
package insert, available at:  
http://www.gene.com/download/pdf/rituxan_prescribing.pdf  
9.1.2 Availability  
The commerci al, FDA -approved formulation of rituximab (Rituxan®, Genentech, Inc, South San 
Francisco, CA) will be used in this study. Rituximab is available in 10 mL and 50 mL single -use 
vials containing 100 mg or 500 mg of rituximab solution, respectively, at a concentration of 10 
mg/mL.  
9.1.3 Storage and stability 
Intact vials should be stored under refrigeration. Dilute solutions for infusion (1- 4 mg/mL) are 
stable for 24 hours under refrigeration, and for an additional 24 hours at room temperature. 
9.1.4 Preparation 
The desired dose of rituximab should be diluted in 0.9% NaCl or D5W to a final concentration of 1-4 mg/mL. Mix by inverting the bag gently. 
9.1.5 Dosage and Administration 
Rituximab will be administered by IV infusion at the dose of 375 mg/m2 on Day 1 of each study treatm ent. Patients must be pretreated with acetaminophen and diphenhydramine on each day of 
antibody treatment.  
Do not administer rituximab IV push or bolus. For the initial infusion, start at a rate of 50 mg/hour; if there is no reaction, increase the rate by  50 mg/hour increments every 30 minutes, to a maximum 
rate of 400 mg/hour. For subsequent infusions, if the patient tolerated the initial infusion, start at a rate of 100 mg/hour; if there is no reaction, increase the rate by 100 mg/hour increments every 3 0 
minutes, to a rate of 400 mg/hour. If the patient did not tolerate the initial infusion, follow the initial infusion guidelines. If a reaction occurs, slow or stop the infusion. If the reaction abates, restart infusion at 50% of the previous rate. 
If the subject did not experience a Grade 3 or 4 infusion- related adverse event during Cycle 1, a 
90-minute infusion can be administered during Cycle 2. Initiate at a rate of 20% of the total dose 
to be given in the first 30 minutes and the remaining 80% of the total dose over the next 60 minutes. 
If the 90 -minute infusion is tolerated during Cycle 2, the same rate can be used during all 
subsequent cycles . Patients who have clinically significant cardiovascular disease or who have a 
circulating lymphocyte count ≥ 5000/mm3 before Cycle 2 should not be administered the 90-
minute infusion. 
BrUOG 326 Protocol       Version  Date: 5/1/2020  
34 9.1.6 Toxicity  
The most serious adverse events associated with rituximab include severe infusion reactions, tumor 
lysis syndrome, and severe mucocutaneous reactions. Severe infusion reactions consisting of hypoxia, pulmonary infiltrates, acute respiratory distress syndrome, myocardial infarction, ventricular fibrillation or cardiogenic shock may be fatal. Most reported fatal reactions occurred within 24 hours of the first dose of rituximab. Because severe infusion reactions have been noted more frequently in patients with high leukocyte counts, such patients should be observed closely.  
Tumor lysis syndrome resulting in renal failure has been described, and occasional fatalities noted. 
Tumo r lysis syndrome is more likely in patients with high numbers of circulating malignant cells.  
Severe mucocutaneous reactions associated with rituximab include Stevens -Johnson syndrome 
and toxic epidermal necrolysis. The onset of these reactions has been f rom 1 -3 weeks.  
Less severe infusion reactions are common with rituximab. These include fever, chills, and dyspnea. The mechanism of rituximab infusion reactions is thought to be the release of cytokines.  
Hepatitis B reactivation with fulminant hepatitis,  hepatic failure and death in some patients with 
hematologic malignancies treated with rituximab have been reported. The majority of these patients received rituximab in combination with chemotherapy. The median time to diagnosis of hepatitis was approximately 4 months after starting rituximab and approximately 1 month after the last dose.  
Exacerbation or reactivation of other viral infections has also been reported with rituximab. JC 
virus reactivation leading to progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy  in patients who were 
receiving rituximab has been reported. Patients presenting with new neurologic findings (e.g., major changes in vision, unusual eye movements, loss of balance or coordination, confusion) should be evaluated for progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy. An increase in fatal infection in HIV -related lymphoma patients when rituximab was used in combination with CHOP 
chemotherapy, as compared to CHOP alone has been reported.  
For a comprehensive list of adverse events, refer to the Rituxan® package insert.  
9.1.7 Drug interactions  
Rituximab does not have any known clinically significant interactions with other study drugs.  
9.2 Bendamustine hydrochloride  
9.2.1 Product description 
Bendamustine hydrochloride is an alkylating antineoplastic drug which is a bi functional 
mechlorethamine derivative containing a purine -like benzimidazole ring. It is indicated for 
treatment of patients with CLL or with an indolent B -cell non- Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) that has 
progressed during or within six months of treatment with ri tuximab or a rituximab -containing 
regimen.

35 9.2.2 Availability  
Treanda® (Cephalon, Inc. Frazer, PA)  is supplied as a single -use vial containing 100 mg 
bendamustine HCL as white to off -white lyophilized powder. Bendeka® (Teva Oncology, North 
Wales, PA) is supplied in individual cartons of 5 mL clear multiple -dose vials containing 100 mg 
of bendamustine h ydrochloride as a clear, and colorless to yellow ready -to-dilute solution. 
9.2.3 Storage and stability 
Treanda® may be stored up to 25° C (77°F) with excursions permitted up to 30°C (86°F). 
Bendeka® should be stored in a refrigerator, 2°- 8°C (36°- 46°F). Retain in original package until  
time of use to protect from light.  
9.2.4 Preparation 
9.2.4.1 Treanda® 
• Aseptically reconstitute each 100 mg bendamustine HCl (Treanda®) vial with 20 mL of only 
Sterile Water for Injection, USP. Shake well to yield a clear, colorless to a pale y ellow solution 
with a bendamustine HCl concentration of 5 mg/mL. The lyophilized powder should completely dissolve in 5 minutes. If particulate matter is observed, the reconstituted product should not be used. 
• Aseptically withdraw the volume needed for the  required dose (based on 5 mg/mL 
concentration) and immediately transfer to a 500 mL infusion bag of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP (normal saline). As an alternative to 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP (normal saline), a 500 mL infusion bag of 2.5% Dextrose/0.45% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP, may be considered. The resulting final concentration of bendamustine HCl in the infusion bag should be within 0.2 – 0.6 mg/mL. The reconstituted solution must be transferred to the 
infusion bag within 30 minutes of reconstitution. After transferring, thoroughly mix the contents of the infusion bag. The admixture should be a clear and colorless to slightly yellow solution. 
Use Sterile Water for Injection, USP, for reconstitution and then either 0.9% Sodium Chl oride 
Injection, USP, or 2.5% Dextrose/0.45% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP, for dilution, as outlined above. No other diluents have been shown to be compatible. 
Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior 
to administration whenever solution and container permit. Any unused solution should be 
discarded according to institutional procedures for antineoplastics. 
9.2.4.2 Bendeka®  
Follow the procedure according to FDA- approved Prescribing Information:  
• Aseptically  withdraw the volume needed for the required dose from the 25 mg/mL solution 
and immediately transfer the solution to a 50 mL infusion bag of one of the following diluents: 
− 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP; or − 2.5% Dextrose/0.45% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP; or − 5% Dextrose Injection, USP. The resulting final concentration of 
bendamustine hydrochloride in the infusion bag should be within 1.85 mg/mL – 5.6 mg/mL. 
After transferring, thoroughly mix the contents of the infusion bag. The admixture should be a clear, and colorless to yellow solution. 
BrUOG 326 Protocol       Version  Date: 5/1/2020  
36 • Bendeka® injection contains no antimicrobial preservative. The admixture should be prepared 
as close as possible to the time of patient administration. If diluted with 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP, or 2.5% Dextrose/0.45% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP, the final admixture is stable for 24 hours when stored refrigerated (2 -8°C or 36- 46°F) or for 6 hours when stored 
at room temperature (15 -30°C or 59- 86°F) and room light. Administration of diluted 
Bend eka® injection must be completed within this period of time. In the event that 5% 
Dextrose Injection, USP is utilized, the final admixture is stable for 24 hours when stored refrigerated (2 -8°C or 36 -46°F) or for only 3 hours when stored at room temperatur e (15 -30°C 
or 59- 86°F) and room light. Administration of diluted BENDEKA must be completed within 
this period of time.  
9.2.5 Dosage and Administration 
Treanda®  is administered by intravenous route over 30 minutes in 500 mL of 0.9% Sodium 
Chloride (or 2.5% Dextrose/0.45% Sodium Chloride). Bendeka® is administered by intravenous route over 10 minutes in 50 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride, or 0.45% Sodium Chloride  /2.5% 
Dextrose or 5% Dextrose  . 
Bendamustine will be administered in this study at the dose of 90 mg/m
2 each day on Days 1 and 
2 of each cycle.  
9.2.6 Toxicity  
The most common side effect is bone marrow suppression. Most common non- hematologic 
adverse reactions for NHL (frequency ≥15%) are nausea, fatigue, vomiting, diarrhea, pyrexia, constipation, anorexia, cough, headache, weight decreased, dyspnea, rash, and stomatitis. Most common hematologic abnormalities (frequency ≥15%) are lymphopenia, anemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and neutropenia. For a comprehensive list of adverse events, refer to Treanda® or Bendeka® package insert.  
9.2.7 Drug interactions  
Concomitant CYP1A2 inducers or inhibitors have the potential to affect the exposure of bendamustine. Inhibitors of CYP1A2 (e.g., fluvoxamine, ciprofloxacin) have potential to increase plasma concentrations of bendamustine and decrease plasma concentrations of active metabolites. 
Inducers of CYP1A2 (e.g., omeprazole, smoking) have potential to decrease plasma concentrations of bendamustine and increase plasma concentrations of its active metabolites. Caution should be used, or alternative  treatments considered if concomitant treatment with CYP1A2 inhibitors or 
inducers is needed.  
9.3 Vincristine sulfate liposomal injection (Marqibo®)  
9.3.1 Product description 
Marqibo® is a vinca alkaloid indicated for the treatment of adul t patients with Philadelphia 
chromosome- negative acute lymphoblastic leukemia in second or greater relapse or whose disease 
has progressed following two or more anti -leukemia therapies. The drug substance and active 
ingredient is the chemotherapeutic agent , vincristine sulfate. Vincristine Sulfate is supplied as 
Vincristine Sulfate Injection, USP which is a component of the Vincristine Sulfate Liposome Injection (0.16 mg/mL) (Marqibo®) kit. Vincristine Sulfate Liposome Injection (Marqibo®) binds to microtubular protein of the mitotic spindle causing metaphase arrest.  
BrUOG 326 Protocol       Version  Date: 5/1/2020  
37 A comprehensive product information and list of adverse effects is available in the Marqibo® 
package insert, available at:  
http://marqibo.com/pi  
Additional information about VSLI is provided in Section 2.5 . 
9.3.2 Availability  
Marqibo® is supplied as a single -use, 3 -vial kit designed to enable entrapment of vincristine in 
sphingomyelin/cholesterol liposomes  at the time of use. The active agent consists of vincristine 
sulfate as an aqueous solution and the vehicle consists of sphingomyelin/cholesterol liposomes with a sodium phosphate buffer as described in the 3-vial kit component table below. 
Table 5:  Vincristine Sulfate Liposomes Injection (0.16 mg/mL) 3 -vial Kit Components

1Kit also includes: 1) 1 floatation ring, 2) 1 infusion bag label, 3) 1 Marqibo® overlabel, 4) 1 set of constitution instructi ons. 
Vincristine is encapsulated into the sphingomyelin/cholesterol liposomes during the constitution 
procedure. Vincristine sulfate injection, sphingomyelin/cholesterol liposomes, and buffer are combined and warmed to 65 ± 2° C for 10 minutes. The sphingomyelin/cholesterol liposomes have an internal pH of ~4.0. When the sodium phosphate buffer and vincristine sulfate injection are added, the solution outside the liposomes has a pH of ~7.3. The pH gradient induces vincristine to migrate across the sphingomyelin/ cholesterol  liposome membrane, which becomes more 
permeable upon heating. Returning to room temperature, the sphingomyelin/cholesterol liposome membrane loses its permeability with the vincristine encapsulated inside.

approximately 60 to 90 minutes to prepare. The preparer should have dedicated uninterrupted time 
to prepare Marqibo® due to the extensive monitoring of temperature and time required for the preparation.  
Aseptic technique must be strictly observed since no preservative or bacteriostatic agent is present 
in Marqibo®. The preparation steps of Marqibo® that involve mixing the Sodium Phosphate Injection, Sphingomyelin/Cholesterol Liposome Injection, and Vincristine Sulfate Injection must be done in a biological safety cabinet or by established pharmacy safety procedures for the preparation of sterile injectable formulations and hazardous drugs. If using the water bath, the preparation steps that involve placement of the vial in the water bath must be done outside of the sterile area.  
Do not use with in- line filters. Do not mix with other drugs.  
Please note the kit instructions will include details on the use of the water bath and the heat block.  
BrUOG 326 Protocol       Version  Date: 5/1/2020  
39 Water bath:   
1. Fill a water bath  with water to a level of at least 8 cm (3.2 inches) measured from the bottom and maintain this minimum water 
level throughout the procedure. The water bath must remain outside of the sterile area.  
2. Place a calibrated thermometer in the water bath to monitor water temperature and leave it in the water bath until the procedure 
has been completed.  
3. Preheat water bath to 63°C to 67°C. Maintain this water temperature until completion of the procedure using the calibrated 
thermometer.  
4. Visually inspect each vial  in the Marqibo® Kit for particulate matter and discoloration prior to preparation, whenever solution 
and container permit. Do not use if a precipitate or foreign matter is present.  
5. Remove all the caps on the vials and swab the vials with sterile alcohol pads.  
6. Vent the Sodium Phosphate Injection vial with a sterile venting needle equipped with a sterile 0.2 micron filter or other sui table 
venting device in the biological safety cabinet. Always position venting needle point well above liquid level before a dding 
Sphingomyelin/Cholesterol Liposome Injection and VinCRIStine Sulfate Injection.

the vial from the water bath (use tongs to prevent burns) and remove the Flotation Ring.  
16. Record the final constitution time and the water temperature on the Marqibo® Overlabel.   
17. Dry the exterior of the Sodium Phosphate Injection vial with a clean paper towel, affix Marqibo® (vinCRIStine sulfate 
LIPOSOME injection) Overlabel, and gently invert 5 times to mix. DO NOT SHAKE.  
18. Permit the constituted vial contents to equilibrate for at least 30 minutes to c ontrolled room temperature (15°C to 30°C, 59°F 
to 86°F).  
19. Marqibo® (vinCRIStine sulfate LIPOSOME injection) contains 5 mg/31 mL (0.16 mg/mL) vincristine sulfate. One prepared, 
store at controlled room temperature (15°C to 30°C, 59°F to 86°F) for no more than 12 hours.  
20. Swab the top of the vial now containing Marqibo® with a sterile alcohol pad and return the vial back into the biological safe ty 
cabinet.  
21. Calculate the patient’s Marqibo® dose based on the patient’s actual body surface area (BSA) and remove t he volume 
corresponding to the patient’s Marqibo® dose from an infusion bag containing 100 mL of 5% Dextrose Injection or 0.9% 
Sodium Chloride Injection.  
22. Inject the dose of Marqibo® into the infusion bag to result in a final volume of 100 mL.  
23. Complete th e information required on the Infusion Bag Label and apply to the infusion bag.  
24. Finish administration of the diluted product within 12 hours of the initiation of Marqibo® preparation.  
25. Empty, clean, and dry the water bath after each use.  
26. Deviations in te mperature, time, and preparation procedures may fail to ensure proper encapsulation of vincristine sulfate into 
the liposomes. In the event that the preparation deviates from the instructions in the above steps, the components of the kit  
should be discarde d and a new kit should be used to prepare the dose.  
Block Heater:  
1. Arrange the three heater blocks in the Block Heater such that the block holding the constitution vial is centered between 
the two other blank heater blocks.  
2. Place a calibrated thermometer i n the block opening adjacent to the vial well to monitor the temperature. Leave the 
thermometer in the block opening until the procedure has been completed.  
3. Turn on the Block Heater and set the controller to 75°C. Verify the block temperature by checking that the thermometer inserted in the block reads 75 ±2°C. Equilibrate the heating block at 75 ±2°C for 15 minutes. Maintain this block 
temperature until completion of the procedure using the calibrated thermometer.  
4. Visually inspect each vial in the MARQIBO  Kit for particulate matter and discoloration prior to preparation, whenever 
solution and container permit. Do not use if a precipitate or foreign matter is present. Note that 
Sphingomyelin/cholesterol  
BrUOG 326 Protocol       Version  Date: 5/1/2020  
40 liposomes are a white to off -white homogeneous suspens ion, essentially free of visible foreign matter and aggregates.  
5. Remove all the caps on the vials and swab the vials with sterile alcohol pads.  
6. Vent the Sodium Phosphate Injection vial with a sterile venting needle equipped with a sterile 0.2 -micron filter or other 
suitable venting device in the biological safety cabinet. Always position venting needle point well above liquid level 
before adding Sphingomyelin/Cholesterol Liposome Injection and VinCRIStine Sulfate Injection.

19. Swab the top of the vial now containing MARQIBO with a sterile alcohol pad and  
return the vial back into the biological safety cabinet.  
20. Calculate the patient’s MARQIBO dose based on the patient’s actual body surface area (BSA) and remove the volume 
corresponding to the patient’s Marqibo dose from an  
infusion bag containing 100 mL of 5% Dextrose Injection or 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection.  
21. Inject the dose of MARQIBO into the infusion bag to result in a final volume of 100 mL.  
22. Complete the information required on the Infusion Bag Label and applyto the infusion bag.  
23. Finish administration of the diluted product within 12 hours of the initiation of MARQIBO preparation.  
24. Deviations in temperature, time, and preparation procedures may fail to ensure proper encapsulation of vincristine sulfate into the liposomes. In the event that the preparation deviates from the instructions in the above steps, the components of 
the kit should be discarded and a new  kit should be used to prepare the dose.
 
Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration 
prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Do not use if a precipitate or foreign matter is present. 
9.3.5 Dosage and Administration 
Marqibo® will be administered at a patient- specific dose established for each patient at the time 
of registration (see Section 4.3 and Section 5.1
). The dose will be given intravenously over 60 
minutes (±10 minutes) on Day 2 of each treatment cycle.  
Marqibo® may be infused through a free running peripheral or central venous catheter, without the use of an inline filter, using an infusion pump. For peripheral venous access, a minimum 21-
gauge catheter or butterfly should be used. It is extremely important that the intravenous needle or catheter be properly positioned before any Marqibo® is administered. Leakage into surrounding tissue during intravenous administration of Marqibo® may cause local irritation. If extravasation occurs, the injection should be discontinued immediately and managed per institutional 
BrUOG 326 Protocol       Version  Date: 5/1/2020  
41 procedures. Any remaining portion of the dose should be introduced into another vein. 
Marqibo® should be administered only by intravenous infusion and by individuals experienced 
with the administration of vincristine sulfate.  
Marqibo® should not be mixed with or diluted with other drugs or solutions for infusion. It is recommended that the infusion bag and tubing be constructed from medical grade PVC. There is currently no compatibility data available for material other than medical grade PVC.  It is not required that the Marqibo® dose be corrected for obese subjects. 
9.3.6 Toxicity  
Marqibo® has a safety profile comparable to conventional vincristine. Neurotoxicity is the dose 
limiting toxicity of Marqibo, mostly peripheral sensory neuropathy. The severity of neuropathy 
worsens with cumulative dose but this occurs gradually. Myelosuppression is evident from 
Marqibo® treatment but significant myelotoxicity occurs infrequently and can be managed with 
the concomitant use of colony stimulating factors. Fatigue was commonly observed but severe 
infections, infusion- related pyrexia, severe gastrointestinal symptoms, and alopecia were seen 
infrequently. Other common or important adverse effects reported in clinical experience with 
Marqibo® include:  
• General: chills, pain, mucosal inflammation and infusion site leakage  
• Hematologic: neutropenia, febrile neu tropenia and thrombocytopenia 
• Gastrointestinal: abdominal pain, hemorrhage, weight loss, vomiting, ulceration, swelling 
in mouth/colon/stomach 
• Metabolism: dehydration, change in chemistries, elevation of liver enzymes  
• Musculoskeletal: weakness, jaw pain - notes as common  
• Neurologic: peripheral neuropathy, urinary retention 
• Respiratory: shortness of breath with potential for respiratory failure 
• Cutaneous: alopecia, rash  
• Cardiovascular: hypertension, hypotension 
For a comprehensive list of adverse events, refer to Marqibo® package insert. 
9.3.7 Drug Accountability 
All study drug supplies must be kept in a locked limited access room. The study drug must not be used outside the context of the protocol. Under no circumstances should the Investigator or other site person nel supply study drug to other Investigators, subjects, or clinics, or allow supplies to be 
used other than directed by this protocol without prior authorization from the Sponsor and the drug manufacturer.  
The pharmacist will maintain complete drug accountability records as described in Section 12.3.6
. 
Periodically throughout the study, and again at the end of the study, BrUOG will require 
submission of the drug accountability record providing a complete accounting of the receipt and disposition of each vial of study drug and the total number of vials dispensed to each subject. This 
will occur again at the closure of the study. 
9.3.8 Drug Handling 
As with other potentially toxic anticancer agents, care should be exercised in the handling and preparation of infusion solutions with Marqibo®. The use of gloves and protective garments is 
BrUOG 326 Protocol       Version  Date: 5/1/2020  
42 recommended during Marqibo® preparation. Preparation should occur in a vertical laminar flow 
biological hood using proper aseptic technique. Disinfect vertical laminar flow biological hood by 
wiping surfaces with 70% isopropyl alcohol or by established pharmacy procedures. If a solution of Marqibo® contacts  the skin, wash immediately and thoroughly with soap and water. If 
Marqibo® contacts the mucous membranes, flush thoroughly with water. Dispose of all anticancer agents according to institutional policy.  
9.3.9 Spillage/Contamination  
Wear gloves, mask, and protective clothing. Treat spilled liquid with sodium hypochlorite solution. Carefully absorb solution with gauze pads or towels, wash area with water and absorb with gauze or towels again. 
Place the gauze pads or towels in a plastic bag, seal, double bag and mark as  hazardous waste. 
Dispose of waste by incineration or by other methods approved for hazardous materials. Personnel involved in clean up should wash with soap and water. 
9.3.10 Disposal 
Avoid contact with skin by using gloves. All needles, syringes, vials, and other materials that have 
come in contact with vincristine sulfate should be segregated in plastic bags, sealed, and marked as hazardous waste. Incinerate at 1000°C or higher. Sealed containers may explode if a tight seal exists.  
If incineration is not availa ble, sodium hypochlorite (household bleach) may be added to the vial(s) 
to detoxify the vincristine sulfate. Care must be taken to vent the vial(s) to avoid a pressure build-up of chlorine gas generated. Decomposition occurs within 10 minutes. Dispose of detoxified vials in a safe manner.  
Dispose all components of the Vincristine Sulfate Liposomes Injection Marqibo® Kit that did not come into contact with vincristine sulfate as per established pharmacy procedures for non-biohazardous waste. 
The water bath c an be destroyed on site, per institutional policy.  
The destruction of all materials is required to be documented via the drug accountability log, 
except for used vials . Prior to destroying drug or any materials  (such as the water bath etc) , 
BrUOG must be made aware and obtain approval from Acrotech Biopharma, LLC . Once 
approved by Acrotech Biopharma, LLC , BrUOG will then approve site destruction of all 
materials including drug, before destruction occurs. This does not include the destruction of used 
vials.  
10. AGENT  ACCOUNTABILITY  
10.1 Agent Inventory Records 
The investigator, or a responsible party designated by the investigator, must maintain a careful record of the inventory and disposition of all agents received from manufacturer using a Drug Accountability Reco rd Form. Sites must submit to BrUOG accountability logs during the study 
and prior to destruction. To be able to destroy drug, sites must contact BrUOG who will obtain approval from Acrotech Biopharma, LLC  prior to destruction.  
BrUOG 326 Protocol       Version  Date: 5/1/2020  
43 10.2 Treatment Compliance  
Recor ds of study medication used, dosages administered, and intervals between visits will be 
recorded during the study. Drug accountability will be noted. 
All drugs will be administered to eligible patients under the supervision of the investigator or identifie d sub- investigator(s).  The pharmacist will maintain records of drug receipt drug 
preparation, and dispensing, including the applicable lot numbers. Any discrepancy between the calculated dose and dose administered and the reason for the discrepancy must be recorded in the source documents. 
11. ADVERSE
 DRUG  REACTION  REPORTING  
11.1 Adverse Events and Potential Risks List  
11.1.1 Adverse event ( definition ) 
An adverse event  (AE) will be defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient enrolled 
in the study, which may or  may not have a causal relationship with this treatment. AEs will include:  
• any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease, whether or not considered related 
to the study therapy; 
• pre-existing events or illnesses which increase in frequency or severity or change in nature 
during or as a consequence of study treatment; 
• pre- or post- treatment complications that occur as a result of protocol-mandated procedures. 
Any AE with an onset date between the date the subject signs the informed consent for this 
trial and the date of End-of-study Assessment should be recorded as an AE in the patient files. 
AEs do not  include disease progression. Any events that are unequivocally due to progression of 
disease must not be reported as AEs, unless they result in the death of the patient.  
11.1.2 Serious adverse events  
A serious adverse event (SAE) will be any AE occurring during the time on study that results in 
any of the following outcomes: 
• Death;  
• Life-threatening adverse event;  
• An AE that results in an inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization 
for ≥ 24 hours;  
• A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions; 
• Congenital anomaly/birth defect in the offspring of a subject who received study drug;  
• Important Medical Events (IME) that may not result in death, be life threatening, or require hospitalization may be considered serious when, based upon medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. 
 “Life -threatening” means that the patient is at immediate risk of death from the event as it 
occurred. This definition does not encompass an event that might  have led to death, if it had 
occurred with greater severity. Complications that occur during hospitalizations are AEs. If a complication prolongs hospitalization, it is an SAE.

11.2 Routine Adverse Event Reporting  
All AEs , whether serious or non- serious, related or unrelated, will be reported from the time the 
signed and dated informed consent form is obtained until the date of Off Study Assessment , 
or until the subject withdraws consent from study participation, or at the time the patient is deemed 
ineligible for the study, whichever occurs first.  AEs will be graded, assessed by the Investigator, 
and recorded on the CRF. All AEs must  be reported in routine study data submissions.  The 
descriptions and grading scales found in the revised NCI Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0 will be utilized for AE reporting. These are available at: 
BrUOG 326 Protocol       Version  Date: 5/1/2020  
47 http://evs.nci.nih.gov/ftp1/CTCAE/About.html     and 
https://safetyprofiler -ctep.nci.nih.gov/CTC/CTC.aspx 
AEs occurring during Cycle 1 of study treatment will be used for DLT designation if they meet 
the DLT definition ( Section 6.3). AEs occurring during Cycle 1 through 6 will be recorded and 
used for determination of secondary outcomes (cumulative toxicity). 
During each study assessment, all new AEs as well as previously occurred, unresolved AEs will be recorded. For each AE, the following items will be recorded: 
11.3 Serious Adverse Event Reporting  
All SAEs and deaths occurring within the AE reporting timeframe must be reported to BrUOG, 
the drug manufacturer and the IRB. The process of reporting is initiated by the Investigator  
according to the guideline below. 
11.3.1 Investigator’s responsibilities.  
11.3.1.1 Telephone /email report to BrUOG:  
Investigator (or designee at the site) must notify BrUOG within 24 hours of learning of the event 
by phone: 401-863-3000 or email. Investigator (or designee at the site) must provide 24-hour 
notification prior to submitting SAE to BrUOG (unless event is a death, for which site is to provide notification more expeditiously). 
11.3.1.2 Written report to BrUOG.   
Investigator (or designee at the site) must provide a written signed report using the 
MedWatch 
3500A form , within 4 calendar  days of the event  (or as soon as they are aware of the event) , to the 
BrUOG Central Office by email or fax:  
Brown University Oncology Research Group  
Phone : (401) 863-3000  Fax: (401) 863-3820 
Email : BrUOG@brown.e du  
 All deaths during treatment or within 30 days following completion of active protocol therapy must be reported within 4 calendar  days or as soon as the investigator is made aware of the event. 
If the death is thought to be related to the study drug, deaths must be reported within 24 hours of the investigator being made aware of the event.  
The initial report must be as complete as p ossible, including an assessment of the causal 
relationship between the event and the investigational product, if available. Information not available at the time of the initial report must be documented on a follow -up report.  
MedWatch 3500A reporting guideline : In addition to completing appropriate patient 
demographic and suspect medication information, the report should include the following information within the Event Description (section 5) of the MedWatch 3500A form: 
• Treatment regimen (dosing freq uency, combination therapy) 
• Protocol description and number : BrUOG 326 and IIS- MAR -003 
• Description of event, severity, treatment, and outcome, if known 
• Expectedness  (determined by investigator based on Investigator Brochure, protocol and 
consent) 
BrUOG 326 Protocol       Version  Date: 5/1/2020  
48 • Supportive laboratory results and diagnostics 
• Investigator’s assessment of the relationship of the adverse event to investigational product 
(Marqibo®), bendamustine, rituximab, disease, or any suspect medication. 
Additional follow -up information : 
For any follow-up SAE report, submit a new MedWatch 3500A report; do not resubmit the initial 
report with any additions. The follow -up report must  be submitted to BrUOG with subject 
identifiers (subject number, initials, and date of birth), protocol description and number ( BrUOG 
326 and IIS -MAR -003), suspect drug, a brief summary of previously reported SAE information, 
and any new information, including modification of prior events, causality, new serious events , 
discharge date,  etc. 
A final report documenting discharge date from the hospital is required.  
11.3.1.3 Investigator’s report to the IRB 
The Investigator is required to notify his/her Institutional Review Board (IRB) of a serious adverse 
event according to institutional policy.  
11.3.2 BrUOG responsibilities.

LLC  will be attached to the SAE and retained with the study records at BrUOG . 
11.4 Overdos age 
There are currently no data available regarding overdosage of Marqibo® or rituximab . The 
treatment  of AEs associated with overdosage  should be supportive for the underlying adverse 
symptoms. Management of overdosage of bendamustine should include general supportive 
measures, including monitoring of hematologic parameters and electrocardiogram . Signs and 
symptoms of an overdose that mee t the criteria of serious should be reported as a SAE and be 
documented as clinical sequelae to an overdose. 
11.5 Procedures in the Event of Pregnancy  
Marqibo® can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman.  There are no 
adequate and controlled studies of Marqibo® or vincristine sulfate conducted in pregnant women. 
Vincristine sulfate is a known teratogen in animals. Therefore women and men of child bearing potential must use adequate methods of birth control  while participating in the study, from the 
registration through 4 months after the last dose of study treatment.  
Pre-menopausal women of childbearing potential must inform the Investigator immediately if they 
become pregnant during the study, and must be immediately removed from the protocol if a pregnancy occurs. The Investigator will counsel the patient and discuss the risk and the possible 
BrUOG 326 Protocol       Version  Date: 5/1/2020  
49 effects on the fetus. Monitoring of the patient will continue  until conclusion of the pregnancy. 
If a female partner of a male subject on the study product becomes pregnant, the male subject 
should notify the Investigator, and the pregnant female partner should be advised to call her healthcare provider immediately.  
Treatment on study must be discontinued immediately in the event of a pregnancy. The pregnancy must be reported to BrUOG by the i nvestigator within 1 working day of learning about it on the 
Medwatch 3500A form
, and Br UOG will in turn report it to Acrotech Biopharma, LLC  within 1 
working day of receiving the documentation from the investigator . Pregnancies and suspected 
pregnancies (including a positive pregnancy test regardless of age or state of the disease) of a female subject occurring within the AE reporting window are considered immediately reportable. 
12. REMOVAL  OF PATIENTS  FROM  PROTOCOL  THERAPY  
Patients will be removed from study when any of the criteria listed in Section 4.5 applies.  The 
reason for study removal and the date the patient was r emoved must be documented in the CRF. 
Patients who discontinue the study treatment should undergo the End-of- study Assessment within 
30 to 42 days after their last treatment.  Documentati on of all SAEs and AEs are to be collected up 
to the date of the End- of-study Assessment.  
13. REGULATORY  CONSIDERATIONS  
This research study is sponsored by the Principal Investigator, Dr. Adam J. Olszewski, in collaboration with Brown University Oncology Research Group (BrUOG), which will serve as the central coordinating office for the study.  
14. DATA
 MONITORING,  QUALITY  ASSURANCE  AND  RECORD  RETENTION  
14.1 Rationale for the study and subject selection  
Most indolent B -cell lymphomas, including the follicular, mantle c ell, marginal zone, and 
lymphoplasmacytic subtypes, are at present incurable in the majority of patients. The goals of 
treatment include relief (palliation) of symptoms and achievement of remission from the lymphoma. Currently available standard regimens, such as bendamustine -rituximab (BR), have a 
limited potential to achieve these goals, and are associated with recurrences of the disease in a majority of patients . Development of more active regimens, which would provide improved 
response rates and duration of remission, without compromising the toxicity profile and patients’ quality of life, is an important research  goal.  For example, current NCCN guidelines ® for 
treatment of follicular lymphoma  recommend consideration of investigational therapy as first line 
of treatment given incurability with conventional therapy.
18 
Patients eligible for this study must be otherwise good candidates for the standard BR regimen as would be administered in routine clinical practice  and supported by current NCCN guidelines®. 
All patients must read, comprehend, and sign the IRB -approved Informed Consent prior to 
engaging in any study- related procedures.  
14.2 Data and Safety Monitoring Plan 
This study will treat 10 subjects. Patients who experience a DLT during the first cycle of therapy 
will be removed from the study and their further treatment will be  at the managing physician’s 
discretion. If the first three patients experience a DLT or anytime the posterior probability that the 
BrUOG 326 Protocol       Version  Date: 5/1/2020  
50 DLT rate at the minimum dose exceeds 0.33 is 0.8 or more, the study regimen will be considered 
too toxic and the study will be terminated.  
All AEs occurring during the study treatment will be recorded in the study data files ( Section 11), 
All SAEs will be immediately reported to BrUOG, who will then report them to Acrotech 
Biopharma, LL C  (Section 11.3 ). The Principal Investigator will be responsible for reviewing the 
toxicities in all study participants, identifying, reporting and resolving any potential issues related to the study conduct, obse rved AEs and data management and safety.  
Protocol deviations and violations will be managed and reported according to BrUOG’s Standard 
Operating Procedures.

15. DATA
 SAFETY  AND  MONITORING  BOARDS  
This BrUOG study is subject to oversight by the Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB). The 
BrUOG DSMB me ets two times per year with additional meetings scheduled when needed. The 
DSMB responsibilities are as follows:  
• Familiarize the DSMB members with the research protocol.  
• Review trial performance information including accrual information.   
• Review interim a nalyses of outcome data and cumulative toxicity data summaries to determine 
whether the trial should continue as originally designed, should be changed, or should be terminated based on these data.   
• Determine whether and to whom outcome results should be released prior to the reporting of 
study results.  
• All adverse events are reviewed by the committee, with assurances that these have been in fact 
sent for review to all pertinent IRBs. 
• Review of reports of related studies to determine whether the monitored study needs to be changed or terminated.  
• Review major proposed modifications to the study prior to their implementation (e.g., termination, dropping an arm based on toxicity results or other reported trial outcomes, increasing target sample size).  
• Followin g each DSMB meeting, provide the study leadership with written information 
concerning findings for the trial as a whole related to cumulative toxicities observed and any relevant recommendations related to continuing, changing, or terminating the trial.  
The DSMB leadership will provide information on cumulative toxicities and relevant 
recommendations to the local principal investigators to be shared with their IRB’s. 
16. STATISTICAL
 CONSIDERATIONS  
16.1 Study Design/Endpoints  
This is a Phase 1, single -center, open -label, single -arm trial evaluating escalating doses of 
Marqibo® in combination with standard doses of bendamustine -rituximab (BRiM) in adult 
patients with indolent B -cell non- Hodgkin lymphoma, for whom bendamustine -rituximab is 
otherwise clinically indicate d as initial or subsequent line of therapy. 
BrUOG 326 Protocol       Version  Date: 5/1/2020  
53 16.1.1 Primary endpoint 
The primary endpoint in this study is the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD)  of Marqibo® in the 
BRiM combination.  
MTD is defined to be the dose level of Marqibo® that when administered to a patient in the BRiM 
combination results in a probability of θ  = 33% that a DLT will be manifest within the first cycle 
of treatment. It will be synonymous with the recommended phase II dose for this regimen. 
Upon completion of the trial, the primary endpoint will be calculated as the median of the marginal 
posterior distribution of the MTD, rounded to 0.05 mg/m2. The MTD and the 95% highest posterior density credible interval estima te of the MTD will be reported, as calculated by the 
Investigator in cooperation with the study statistician. Data from all enrolled patients will be used for the calculation.  
The computation of the dose to be administered to each patient and the 95% highest posterior 
density credible interval estimate of the MTD will be carried out by the Investigator in cooperation 
with statistician consultant, using the Web -EWOC computer software, available at:
42 
http://biostatistics.csmc.edu/ewoc/  
In case of unavailability of the Web -EWOC interface, the stand -alone EWOC Version 3.1 will be 
used. The results of all simulations, calculations and dose determinations will be recorded in the study files and signed by the Investigator.  
The DLT will be descri bed as the CTCAE terms for the recorded DLT’s, and the dose level at 
which they occurred. The trial will be terminated after ten patients are evaluated, or if the 
first three patients experience a DLT or anytime the posterior probability that the DLT rate 
at the minimum do se exceeds 0.33 is 0.8 or more. 
16.1.2 Secondary endpoints 
The secondary endpoints of the study include:  
• Tolerability of the BRiM regimen, assessed by proportion of enrolled patients completing 6 
cycles of study treatment.  
• Proportions of patient s experiencing cumulative toxicities with the BRiM combination during 
the study treatment.  
• Proportion of patient achieving partial remission (PR) or complete remission (CR) after completion of the study treatment 
The secondary endpoints will be calculated using data from Off Study Assessments for all enrolled patients. Proportions of patients with cumulative toxicities will be calculated as the total numbers of patients experiencing each of the recorded toxicities at each grade. Each AE will be counted once per patient, at the worst grade experienced during treatment.  
16.1.3 Analysis population 
The endpoints will be assessed in the population of all registered patients. 
16.1.4 Treatment regimen  
The dose of Marqibo® will be determined specifically for each patient at the t ime of registration, 
from the starting dose of 1.8 mg/m2, up to the convergence ceiling dose of 2.4 mg/m2. The computation of the dose to be administered to each patient and the 95% highest posterior density 
BrUOG 326 Protocol       Version  Date: 5/1/2020  
54 credible interval estimate of the MTD will be carried out by the Principal Investigator with the 
EWOC -Web software. The Principal Investigator will provide BrUOG with the dose -assignment 
trees (as in Figure 3 below) for the first 5 patients before the first patient is registered on the study. The Princi pal Investigator will then generate a dose -assignment tree for 4 subsequent patients 
when subject #4 is registered (see Section 16.4
 for details) . 
Patients will be evaluated weekly during the first  cycle to assess  clinical and laboratory toxicity 
and to identify any DLT. Patients will be followed every two weeks during subsequent  cycles, 
until completion of six cycles of therapy or discontinuation of treatment.  
The response to chemotherapy will be evaluated after 3 cycles and 6 cycles of treatment. The cumulative toxicities will be evaluated at each visit. The radiographic responses will be assessed according to the International Working Group criteria
.41  
16.2 EWOC Phase I design 
The dose escalation will follow a Bayesian method permitting precise determination of the therapeutic working -dose while directly controlling the likelihood of an overdose. The method, 
known as EWOC (Escalation With Overdose Control), has been used to design many dose finding clinical tria ls.
43-50 Babb et al. provided a comparison of EWOC with alternative phase I design 
methods.51 They showed that up- and-down designs treated only 35% of patients at optimal dose 
levels, versus 55% for EWOC, i.e., more patients are treated with doses outside the therapeutic window by up -and-down than by EWOC designs. Babb and Rogatko provide a summary of 
Bayesian phase I design methods and Tighiouart et al. studied the performance of EWOC under a rich class of prior distributions for the MTD.
52,53 Tighiouart and Rogatko showed that EWOC is 
coherent.54 
EWOC was the first dose -finding procedure to directly incorporate the ethical constraint of Figure 2: Treatment schema.  

BrUOG 326 Protocol       Version  Date: 5/1/2020  
55 minimizing the chance of treating patients at unacceptably high doses.  Its defining property is that 
the expected proportion of patients treated at doses above the MTD is equal to a specified value 
α, the feasibility bound. This value is selected  by the clinician and reflects his/her level of concern 
about overdosing. Zacks et al. showed that among designs with this defining property, EWOC minimizes the average amount by which patients are under -dosed.
55 This means that EWOC 
approaches the MTD as rapidly as possible, while keeping the expected proportion of patients 
overdosed less than the value α. Zacks et al. also showed that, as a trial progresses, the dose 
sequence defined by EWOC approaches the MTD (i.e., the sequence of recommended doses 
converges in probability to the MTD). Eventually, all patients beyond a certain time would be treated at doses sufficiently close to the MTD.  
16.3 Dose Escalation Procedure 
The dose of Marqibo® for the first patient in this trial will be 1.8 mg/m
2, which is considered to 
be safe in view of feasibility of 2.0 mg/m2 dose in the R -CHMP combination with full -dose 
rituximab and cyclophosphamide.35 The dose for each subsequent patient will be determined so 
that, on the basis of all available data, the probability that it exceeds the MTD is equal to a pre -
specified value α.  In this trial, we set α  = 25%, with an increase α in small increments of 5% until 
α = 50%, this value being a compromise between the therapeutic aspect of the agent and its toxic 
side effects.  
The dose selected for every patient in  the trial will be between the minimum dose of 1.8 mg/m2 
and the maximum allowable dose 2.4 mg/m2. This maximum dose serves only as a convergence 
value for the algorithm and will never be actually administered to any patient. The maximum dose that could be  administered to a patient during the dose escalation portion, in the absence of any 
DLT, would be 2.3 mg/m
2. The trial will be terminated if the first three patients experience a 
DLT or anytime the posterior probability that the DLT rate at the minimum dose exceeds 
0.33 is 0.8 or more. Figure 3 shows all the possible dose sequences that could be realized for the 
first 5 patients, assuming that the first patient is treated at dose level 1.8 mg/m2 and does not 
experience a DLT.    
16.4 Assignment of Marqibo® Dose Level  
The determination of the patient -specific dose of Marqibo® to be delivered as part of the study 
regimen will be performed solely by the BrUOG central office us ing the pr e-populated dose -
Figure 3. Distribution of doses (in mg/m2) for patients 
2-5 in the study according to the EWOC protocol 
(assuming the first patient is treated at dose 1.8 mg/ m2 
and does  not experience a DLT).  
BrUOG 326 Protocol       Version  Date: 5/1/2020  
56 assignment tre es generated by the Principal Investigator . The doses will be calculated using the 
EWOC -web software, available at:42 
http://biostatistics.csmc.edu/ewoc/  
When creating the dose- assignment trees, t he Investigator will input a data matrix containing 
information about all study patients for whom DLT information is available at the time of 
calculation. The following parameters will be set for the software:  
- Target Probability of Dose Limiting Toxicity =  0.33  
- Probability of Exceeding Target Dose =   0.25  
- Minimum Dose =     1.8  - Maximum Dose =     2.4  - Minimum Dose Increment =    0.01  
- Bayesian Confidence Interval Percentage =   95  
- Number of Patients =     1  
- Variable Alpha Increment =    0.05  
- Prior Distribution =     Uniform  
- Uniform Lower =     0  
- Uniform Upper =     0.33  
Only N=1 patient per cohort is allowed, i.e. a ne w subject may be registered for the study 
only after all previous subjects resolve their DLT assessment period.  
At no time will there be more than one subject on the study with unresolved DLT status.  
The calculated dose will be patient -specific and will n ot be adjusted during subsequent cycles 
(except for toxicity, as delineated in Section 5 ).  
16.5 Sample Size/Accrual Rate  
The planned sample size for this study is 10 treated patients with a planned accrual rate of 5 p atients 
per year.  
Procedure for determining the number of patients needed in a dose finding trial using a Bayesian framework depends on the investigators, goal and sets of criteria such as precision of the estimate of the MTD and frequency of DLTs.  The investigators conducted extensive simulations under several scenarios, with true values of the MTD ranging from 1.85 mg/m
2 to 2.20 mg/m2, and 
probability of toxicity at the initial dose (20%) and target probability of DLT ( θ = 33%) set at the 
levels assumed  for the study using prior literature. Table 3 presents results of simulations of N =100 
trials consisting of 10 patients, assuming different levels of true MTD. The results indicate that the study will estimate reasonably precise MTD within a range of MTD 1.80 mg/m
2 to 2.20 mg/m2.

You are being asked to take part in a research study.  All research studies carried out at <INSERT HOSPTIAL NAME> are covered by rules of the Federal government as well as rules of the State and <INSERT HOSPTIAL NAME>.  Under these rules, the researcher will first explain the study, and then he or she will ask you to participate.  You will be asked to sign this agreement that states that the study has been explained, that your questions have been answered, and that you agree to participate.  
The researcher will explain the purpose of the study. He or she will explain how the study will be carried out and what you will be expected to do.  The researcher will also explain the possible risks and possible benefits of being in the study.  You should ask the researcher any questions you have about any of these things before you decide whether you wish to take part in the study.  T his 
process is called informed consent. 
This form also explains the research study.  Please read the form and talk to the researcher about 
any questions you may have.  Then, if you decide to be in the study, please sign and date this form in front of the person who explained the study to you. You will be given a copy of this form to keep. 
Nature and Purpose of the  Study      
Your doctors are participating in this research study sponsored by the Principal Investigator, Dr. 
Adam Olszewski, in collaboration with Brown University Oncology Research Group (BrUOG), which will serve as the central coordinating office for the study 
You have been asked to participate in this study, because you have been diagnosed with a 
lymphoma for which your doctor has recommended t reatment with rituximab and bendamustine 
chemotherapy.  
The combination of rituximab and bendamustine is one of the treatment options for patients with indolent (slow -growing) lymphomas. Although other chemotherapy regimens exist, 
rituximab/bendamustine is often used because it is both effective (works well) and is well tolerated  
by patients when compared with other combinations. Many patients with indolent lymphomas who 
receive rituximab/bendamustine chemotherapy for the first time  experience shrinking of their 
lymphoma . However, some patients with indolent lymphomas do not respond to this treatment, 
and while over half of the patients who do respond are alive and have not had recurrence of their lymphoma more than 5 years after this treatment, in most patients the lymphoma does eventually  
regrow. Also, about 1 in 5 patients treated with rituximab/bendamustine experience a serious side effect (toxicity) during therapy.  New treatments are needed to see if new combinations of 
treatments are well tolerated and might work better.  
The purpose of this study is to find the maximum tolera ted dose of the drug Marqibo® (vincristine 
BrUOG 326 Protocol       Version  Date: 5/1/2020  
68 sulfate liposome injection) that can be given in combination with rituximab and bendamustine for 
patients with  certain types of  lymphoma. This will be determined by looking at the side effects 
that occur during the treatment with the combination. In this study, your doctors hope to show that 
rituximab and bendamustine can be safely combined with Marqibo® in your type of lymphoma , 
called non -Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) . Two previous studies indicated that Marqibo® can be  
safely combined with rituximab and full -dose alkylating agents (similar to Bendamustine, which 
belongs to this same class of drugs) for the treatment of NHL without unexpected side effects. 
Marqibo® is already approved by Food and Drug Administration (FDA ) for the treatment of acute 
lymphoblastic leukemia that has relapsed after at least two other lines of therapy. Acute 
lymphoblastic leukemia is a very aggressive kind of lymphoma that involves blood and bone marrow. Marqibo® has been combined with rituxim ab and other chemotherapy drugs for treatment 
of other kinds of lymphoma in some studies. The active ingredient of Marqibo® (vincristine) is commonly used in chemotherapy combinations for many kinds of lymphoma,  but Marqibo® is not at present FDA-approved for the treatment of your type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma.   The use of Marqibo® in combination with rituximab/bendamustine in this study is experimental. The doses and schedules of rituximab and bendamustine in this study are the same as those used for patients in routine clinical practice. The dose of Marqibo® wil l be decided on for each patient 
participating in the study, depending on side effects seen in all previous patients  enrolled in this 
study. Because in this study Marqibo® is used in combination with rituximab/bendamustine, the doses of Marqibo® used in this study are lower than the FDA -approved dose for acute 
lymphoblastic leukemia.  
 
Approximately 10 patients will be treated on  this study.  
Explanation of Procedures   
What will happen if I take part in this research study?  
If the  following  exams, tests and  procedures show that you can be in the study, and you choose 
to take part, then you will need the following tests, while on the study.  They are part of regular 
cancer care.  
• Medical history  
• A physical examination with performance status, toxicity assessment, weight, vitals, and an assessment of the medications you are taking 
• Blood and urine tests, including blood counts, kidney and liver function, a pregnancy test (if you are a woman who can become pregnant) and tests for the HIV and hepatitis viruses; ma ny 
of these tests will be repeated during the study; approximately three tablespoons of blood will be taken;  
• An electrocardiogram —a simple test that involves putting electrode stickers on your chest to 
record the heart’s electrical activity;  
• A scan to obtain measurements of any lymphoma tumors inside your body. This may be a CT (Computed Tomography) scan or a PET -CT (Positron Emission Tomography and Computed 
Tomography) scan.  
BrUOG 326 Protocol       Version  Date: 5/1/2020  
69 • If your doctor feels it is necessary, a bone marrow aspirate and biopsy will be performed. This 
is a procedure performed by a physician that involves collecting a sample of the marrow from the hip bone to find out if it contains lymphoma cells.  
While on study:  
Different doses of Marqibo® are being tested in this study and each patient  will be registered to 
their own dose  based on how well previous patients did in the study (ranging from the smallest 
dose of 1.8 mg of drug per square meter of body surface area to the highest dose of 2.4 mg of drug per square meter of body surface area). . Patients will be treated to determine the highest safe dose 
of Marqibo® in combination with bendamustine and rituximab.  
The Brown University Oncology Research Group, the group coordinating this trial, will calculate 
the dose of Marqibo® to be used for y our treatment. This calculation will take into consideration 
information about any side effects that happened to any patients previously treated in the study, in 
order to lower the risk of side effects. Neither you nor your doctor can choose which dose you  will 
receive and your dose will not be increased.  
Once your dose has been calculated, you will start the study treatment. The treatment will be given in “cycles” of four weeks (28 days) for a maximum of 6 cycles (about 6 months). It will involve chemother apy with rituximab, bendamustine and Ma rqibo®, given intravenously (through a vein) 
according to the schedule below. 
On Day 1 of each treatment cycle (your visit is expected to last about 6 hours): 
• You will undergo a physical examination including vital signs, ECOG performance status, height, weight, and recording of all medications you take. 
• Laboratory tests before the treatment to confirm normal blood counts, kidney and liver function (approximatel y 2 tablespoons of blood). 
• Urinalysis  
• If you are a woman of childbearing potential you will also have a pregnancy test 
You will then receive:  
• Medications to prevent allergic reactions and nausea (by mouth or intravenously). These are routinely given (they  are standard) to patients receiving rituximab or bendamustine. 
On Day 1 of each treatment cycle you will receive : 
• Rituximab  as an intravenous infusion, which may take up to 4-5 hours to complete. 
• Bendamustine  as an intravenous infusion, over approximately 10 to 30 minutes. 
On Day 2 of each treatment cycle (your visit is expected to last about 2 hours) you will receive:  
• Bendamustine  as an intravenous infusion, over approximately 10 to 30 minutes. 
• Marqibo®  as an intravenous infusion, at a dose calculated for  you at the time of enrollment, 
over approximately 60 minutes. 
If your doctor recommends it, you may also receive an additional medication (pegfilgrastim) on Day 3 or 4 of each cycle. Pegfilgrastim is given as an injection under the skin for patients who a re 
at higher risk of serious infections during chemotherapy. It lowers the risk of infections  by 
increasing the number of a type of white blood cells called neutrophils, which may drop  during 
chemotherapy . 
BrUOG 326 Protocol       Version  Date: 5/1/2020  
70 During cycle 1:  
During the first cycle of treatmen t, you will come in for three weekly checkup visits after treatment 
on; day 8, day 15 and day 22. Each of these visits is expected to last about 1 hour.  You will have 
the following done: 
• Vital signs, ECOG performance status, and weight  
• Toxicity assessmen t  
• Laboratory tests, approximately 2 tablespoons of blood 
During Cycles 2 -6: 
You will be assessed prior to day 1 of cycles 2 -6 as explained above. You will then receive 
treatment on Day 1 and 2 as explained above.  
Day 15: You will also be seen on day 15 o f cycles 2 -6 (each or these visits are expected to last 
about 1 hour) for the following: 
• Vital signs, ECOG performance status, weight 
• Toxicity assessment  
• A scan to obtain measurements of any lymphoma tumors inside your body using a CT 
(Computed Tomography)  scan or a PET -CT (Positron Emission Tomography and Computed 
Tomography) scan will be done after cycle 3 and after cycle 6 or when you come off study. 
• If your doctor feels it is necessary, a bone marrow aspirate and biopsy may be performed if your doctor feels your cancer is responding. This is a procedure performed by a physician that involves collecting a sample of the marrow from the hip bone to find out if it contains lymphoma cells.  
For all patients, treatment on study will be given in cycles of every 4 weeks (28 days) for a maximum of 6 cycles.  
End of study treatment  
Between 30 - 42 days after your last treatment you will undergo the following: 
• History and physical examination, including vital signs, ECOG performance status, weight, 
and recording of all medications you take.  
• Toxicity assessment. If there are any important side effects, your doctor will continue to follow 
your condition until they s tabilize or resolve.  
• A scan to obtain measurements of any lymphoma tumors inside your body may also be done 
(as noted above) if you come off prior to completing all your treatment. 
How long will I be in this study?  
You will receive the study treatment for 6 months.  
  
BrUOG 326 Protocol       Version  Date: 5/1/2020  
71 Can I stop being in this study?  
Yes. You can decide to stop at any time.  Tell the study doctor if you are thinking about stopping 
or decide to stop.  He or she will tell you how to stop safely.   
It is important to tell the study doctor if you are thinking about stopping so any risks from the 
discontinuation of treatment can be evaluated by your doctor.  Another reason to tell your doctor that you are thinking about stopping is to discuss what foll ow-up care and testing could be most 
helpful for you.  
The study doctor may stop you from taking part in this study at any time if he/she believes it is in 
your best interest; if you do not follow the study rules; or if the study is stopped. 
Costs of parti cipating in this study  
Acrotech Biopharma, LLC , the maker of Marqibo®, will provide Marqibo® at no charge while 
you take part in this study. All other services you will receive during this research study are 
considered to be “routine clinical services” that you would have received even if you were not 
participating in the research study. These include all study doctor visits, blood tests, urine tests, bendamustine and rituximab, drugs and administration costs, drugs used to reduce side effects, CT scans, PE T scans, EKGs and bone marrow biopsies.  Therefore, all of the services listed in this 
paragraph will be billed to your health insurance company, but you will be responsible for paying any deductibles, co -payments, or co -insurance that are a normal part of  your health insurance plan. 
If you do not have health insurance or your insurance does not cover these  services, you will be 
responsible for those costs. 
Risks or Discomforts:  
You may have side effects while on the study.  Everyone taking part in the stud y will be watched 
carefully for side effects.  However, doctors don’t know all the side effects that may happen.  Side 
effects may be mild or very serious. Your health care team may give you medicines to help lessen side effects. Many side effects go away soon after you stop the chemotherapy. In some cases, side effects can be serious, long lasting, or may never go away. There also is a risk of death.  You should talk to your study doctor about any side effects that you have while taking part in the study.  
The tables below show the most common and the most serious side effects that researchers know about. There might be other side effects that researchers do not yet know about. If important new side effects are found, the study doctor will discuss these wit h you.

Reproductive risks: You should not become pregnant or father a baby while on this study because the drugs in this study can affect an unborn baby. Women should not breastfeed a baby while on this study.  It is important you understand that if you are a man or woman of childbearing potential you must use birth control while on this study and for up to 4 months post the last dose of study treatment. Appropriate methods of birth control include abstinence, oral contraceptives, implantable hormonal contraceptives (Norplant), or double barrier method (d iaphragm plus condom). Check with your study doctor about what kind 
of birth control methods to use and how long to use them. Women will be asked to have a pregnancy test before starting this study. In case of a pregnancy, you must report it to your study doctor immediately. The drugs used in the study may also make you unable to have 
children in the future. If you wish to re -start breastfeeding after treatment, you should 
discuss the appropriate timing with your physician.  
For more detailed information about risks and side effects, ask your study doctor. 
By signing this document you are acknowledging that you understand and agree to the information 
presented in this Reproductive Risk section. 
Medications to prevent nausea and infusion reactions : As part of the treatment you will receive 
medications to prevent nausea and allergic infusion reactions, which are routinely given to patients 
who receive bendamustine and rituximab. These medications have few side effects, although 
BrUOG 326 Protocol       Version  Date: 5/1/2020  
75 medications used to prevent nausea  and vomiting may cause drowsiness, dry mouth, diarrhea, 
constipation, headache, restlessness, agitation, anxiety, dizziness, involuntary tremors, skin rash, 
and possible allergic reaction. 
Venipuncture (inserting a needle into a vein to obtain blood or gi ve medication): May cause 
inflammation, pain, bruising, bleeding, or infection. When you receive chemotherapy by vein, there is a slight risk that some of the drug may leak out 
around the needle at the injection site. A skin burn may result. Most skin burns are treatable and 
heal well.  
In order to monitor the side effects, your physician will examine you frequently and obtain laboratory tests (blood tests, chest x-rays, or CT scans as needed) to determine the effects of your treatment and alter the drug  dosages if necessary.  
Risk of CT imaging:  CT imaging uses x -rays. The radiation dose associated with this procedure 
is estimated to be a small fraction of the annual permissible dose to an x -ray technologist. There 
is no significant risk from this amount of radiation. 
There may be other side effects that have not been reported. If you have any unusual symptoms, 
you should report them immediately to your doctor or nurse. 
Benefits:  
You may receive no direct benefit from your participation in this study. Your  lymphoma might 
respond to the treatment better or for longer if the study treatment is more effective than standard 
chemotherapy, but this is not known at this time. We do know that the information from this study will help doctors learn more about the way that combined chemotherapy drugs work together as a treatment for cancer.  This information could help future cancer patients. 
Alternatives:  
If you decide not to take part in this study, you have other choices. For example: 
• you may choose to have the usual treatment approach described above 
• you may choose to take part in a different study, if one is available 
• or you may choose not to be treated for the lymphoma, but receive comfort care to relieve 
symptoms.  
Talk to your doctor about your choices before you decide if you will take part in this study.  
Refusal/Withdrawal 
It is up to you whether you want to be in the study.  You are not required to enroll or participate.  
If you decide to participate, you can always change your mind and quit at any time.  If you decide not to be in the study, or if you quit later, you will still be able to get the health care services you normally get.  If you join, but later on the researcher or your doctor feels being in the study is no longer good for you, they may choose  to take you out of the study before it is over.  If new 
information becomes available that might change your mind about whether you want to stay in the study the researcher will share this information with you as soon as possible. 
BrUOG 326 Protocol       Version  Date: 5/1/2020  
76 If you make the decision to withdraw from this study (stop taking study medication) for any reason, 
tell your doctor immediately. You will be asked to sign a form indicating whether you give your 
permission for your doctor and the research staff to continue to collect and submit follow-up information on your health status from your physicians and medical record. After signing the form, you still have the right to change your mind, at any time, regarding follow- up after withdrawal.  
Compensation in Case of Injury:  
A research injury  is any physical or mental injury or illness caused by being in the study. If you 
are injured by a medical treatment or procedure you would have received even if you were not in the study that is not a research injury. To help avoid research injury and added medical expenses, it is very important to follow all study directions carefully. If you do experience a research injury, <INSERT HOSPITAL NAME> or the study doctor can arrange medical treatment for you. Such treatment will be paid for as described below .  
Medical treatment will be available if you suffer a research related injury; however, you and/or your health insurance company will be charged for this treatment. The study will not pay for this medical treatment. Neither Dr. Adam Olszewski nor BrUOG, the coordinating center, have money set aside to reimburse you for medical bills from treatment of a research related injury or otherwise compensate you in the event of a study-related injury.  
If you have insurance and have a research injury that is not covered by the study, it is possible that 
some or all of the cost of treating you could be billed to your insurer. If your health insurance will not cover such costs, it is possible you would have to pay out of pocket. In some cases, <INSERT HOSPITAL NAME>  might be able to help you pay if you qualify for free care under <INSERT HOSPITAL NAME>  policy. However, <INSERT HOSPITAL NAME>  has no policy to cover payment for such things as lost wages, expenses other than medical care, or pain and suffering.

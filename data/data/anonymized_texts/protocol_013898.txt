Primary Safety Objective  This study will evaluate the safety of polyTregs in adult kidney  
transplant recipients.  
Secondary Safety Objective  Participants receiving polyTregs will be evaluate d for  the safety of 
converting from CNI-based maintenance therapy to mTOR inhibitors 
after Treg therapy.  
Primary Efficacy Objective  This study will evaluate whether poly clonally expanded Tregs 
(polyTregs) reduce graft inflammation relative to their enrollment 
biopsy compared to those receiving CNI -based maintenance therapy  
with similar baseline biopsy findings . 
Secondary Efficacy  Objective  This study will evaluate whether polyTregs can reduce graft 
inflammation by 25% or more in the 2 weeks after polyTreg infusion  
relative to the enrollment biopsy. 
Mechanistic Objectives  This study will evaluate the impact of polyTregs on the immunological 
profiles of kidney transplant recipients.

TASK                                                Version 11.0 / January 11, 2022  Study Design  Multi -center, open -label, randomized, controlled trial with 2 cohorts:  
1. Maintenance CNI based immunosuppression therapy  
2. polyTregs  
The original study design included a third treatment arm (d onor 
alloantigen reactive Tregs or darTregs).  One subject was treated with 
darTregs prior to protocol version 9.0 in which this treatment arm 
was eliminated due to excessive manufacturing failures . 
Primary Safety Endpoint s  The safety of polyTregs (Group 2) will be described in comparison 
with CNI -based maintenance IS therapy (Group 1 ) by:   
1. The timing and incidence of Banff 2A or higher acute cell-
mediated rejection and/ or acute antibody mediated rejection  
2. The timing and incidence of study defined Grade 3 or higher 
infection  
Secondary Safety Endpoints for 
polyTregs  The safety of PolyTregs  will also be described in Groups 1  and 2 by: 
1. Timing, incidence,  and severity of polyTreg infusion reactions  
2. Timing, incidence, and severity  of culture-proven and 
clinically diagnosed infections after  polyTreg infusion  
3. Timing, incidence, and severity of acute rejection using Banff 
grading  
4. Timing and incidence  of BK viremia and CMV reactivation  
5. Timing and incidence of > 10% decrease in eGFR compared 
to baseline  
Secondary Safety Endpoint for 
mTOR Therapy  The safety of mTOR therapy after Treg infusion will be assessed by 
the incidence and timing of acute rejection.  Subjects who receive 
Tregs and  convert to mTOR therapy will be compared to subjects who 
did not convert to mTOR therapy , as well as subjects in  Group 1 . 
Primary Efficacy Endpoint  The primary  efficacy  endpoint will be the change in inflammation as 
measured by the percentage area of  cortex  occupied by 
inflammatory cells  using computer -assisted quantitative image 
analysis on the biopsy 7 months after group allocation, expressed as 
the percent change relative to  the baseline biopsy.

TASK                                                Version 11.0 / January 11, 2022  Secondary Efficacy Endpoint s The secondary efficacy endpoint will be the proportion of subjects 
exhibiting a relative decrease of 25% or more inflammation between 
the baseline kidney biopsy  and the biopsy  2 weeks after polyTregs, 
measured as the percentage area of cortex occupied  by inflammatory 
cells using computer -assisted quantitative image analysis.  
Additional secondary efficacy endpoints are the number of subjects 
who exhibit a  relative decrease of 50% or more inflammation on 
kidney biopsy at 2 weeks after polyTregs; and the proportion  of 
subjects who exhibit a  relative decrease of 25% or more 
inflammation at 7 months after group allocation . 
Primary Mechanistic Endpoint  The primary mechanistic endpoints are  the immunologic profiles of 
kidney transplant recipients using graft CRM (common response module) gene expression of rejection and/or evidence of 
inflammation in biopsies at 2 weeks after infusion (Group 2 ) and 7 
months after group allocation  (Group s 1 and 2). 
Secondary Mechanistic Endpoints  The secondary mechanistic endpoints are the immunologic profiles of 
kidney transplant recipients using:  
 Persistence of infused Tregs in blood and biopsies using deuterium labeling and T cell repertoire analysis (Group 2 ) 
 Cytokine and CRM (common response module) mRNA and 
protein profiles in the urine as correlates of acute rejection and/or histologic evidence of inflammation and graft fibrosis 
(Group s 1 and 2) 
 Peripheral blood kSORT (kidney solid organ response test) mRNA expression of rejection/increased immune response 
(Group s 1 and 2) 
Accrual Objective  14 Subjects Total:  
7 subjects on CNI maintenance therapy  
7 subjects to receive polyTregs  
Study Duration  6.5 Year Accrual, 12 Months Follow Up  
Treatment Description   Subjects will be on maintenance IS therapy using CNI + MMF/MPA 
with or without steroids at the time of study entry.   
Eligible subjects will be randomized to receive:  
1. Standard CNI maintenance IS (no Tregs)  
2. 550 ± 450x 106 polyTregs  
After receiving at least 300 x 106 polyTregs infusion, eligible subjects 
will start mTOR inhibitor.

 Background and Rationale   
 Background and Scientific Rationale  
 Chronic  Allograft Dysfunction  
Despite advances in transplantation reducing early acute rejection  rates to <15% and improving 1 -year graft survival to 
>90%, long -term graft attrition rates have remained unchanged at 4% loss per year (Meier-Kriesche HU, 2004) . A major 
contributo r to graft loss is progression of interstitial fibrosis and  tubular atrophy (IF/TA) (Nankivell BJ F. -L. C., 2001)  
(Cosio FG, 2005)  (Nankivell BJ B. R., 2003), which is the result of cumulative allograft damage of immunologic and 
nonimmunologic  origin. Studies of protocol biopsies have provided important clues on how early changes in graft  
histology relate to long -term graft survival. Early sequential post -transplant proto col biopsies show a rapid  increase in 
the prevalence of IF/TA (Cosio, 2005) . When separated into two categories: IF/TA with and IF/TA without  inflammation, 
it appears that is not IF/TA per se that is detrimental, but IF/TA associated with and/or secondary  to inflammation that 
results in progression of renal dysfunction (Park, 2010) (Mannon, 2010) . Chronic immune injury in the allograft is now 
recognized in the majority of patien ts with late graft loss (Mannon, 2010) (El -Zoghby ZM, 20 09). 
 Graft Inflammation  
Inflammation manifested as infiltration of mononuclear cells in the renal allograft appears to be detrimental to the graft 
in the long term, even when insufficient to meet Banff criteria for acute  cellular rejection (types I, II or III). According to 
the Banff classification, interstitial inflammation (i1, i2 and i3)  without tubulitis (t0) is considered “nonspecific”. When 
tubulitis is present but mild (t1) or accompanied by subthreshold  inflammation (t2 with i0 -i1), it is termed “borderline 
change” and deemed “suspicious for acute rejection” (Racusen LC, 1999) . Such changes are common, reported in 11 -
44% of surveillance biopsies within the first year  (Gloor JM, 2002)  (Heilman RL, 2010)  (Thierry A, 2011) . In one study, 
biopsies with borderline change had an intermediate level of expression of proinflammatory genes between that of 
histologically normal biopsie s and those with acute rejection (Hoffmann SC, 2005) . Another  study found that a 
transcriptional profile indicative of activated Th1 cells, but not the magnitude or composition of the infiltrate, uniquely 
defined a functionally  significant allograft rejection (Lipman ML, 1998) . Thus,  it appears that the immune response is 
qualitatively similar but quantitatively reduced in SCI and borderline change, indicating  that these entities carry the 
same potential for alloimmune damage as clinical acute rejection. A study of 124  sequential protocol biopsies in 46 
patients who exhibited histologic evidence of chronic allograft nephropathy at  1 year found that the presence of 
subclinical rejection correlated with histologic progression of chronicity, a  lower creatinine clearance at 5 years, and 
worse long -term graft survival (Shishido S, 2003) . In another study of 435 allograft  recipients, the combination of SCI 
injury and IF/TA on protocol biopsies was strongly associated with later graft  failure, more so that IF/TA alone (Moreso 
F, 2006) . Similarly, in 292 recipients both of living and deceased donor grafts, inflammation even with mild fibrosis 
predict ed worsening graft function (Cosio FG, 2005) . In contrast, the absence of acute inflammation at any time point 
was associated with minimal deterioration in renal function or progression of renal lesions. Finally, a study of 151  living-
donor recipients found that the combination of fibrosis and inflammation in 1 -year protocol biopsies was associated 
with a rejection-like gene expression signature, reduced graft function, and shortened graft survival, even among 
tacrolimus + MPA -treated recipients without overt risk factors for poor outcomes (Park WD, 2010) . In these patients, the 
iothalamate clearance at 3 years in those with inflammation and fibrosis was 52 ± 18 ml/min vs. 70 ± 23 ml/min in those 
with  normal histology (p=0.01). Increased expression of innate and adaptive immune transcripts were seen in the group 
with inflammation and fibrosis, suggesting that early interventions aimed at altering rejection like inflammation may succeed in stabilizing graft function and extending graft survival. Also, while the previous discussion has highlighted the 
role of inflammation in areas of viable cortex of the kidney, recent studies demonstrate that inflammation in areas of fibrosis and atrophy, not usually sco red by Banff criteria, are strongly associated with later graft loss (Mannon RB M. A., 
CTOT-21  Confidential  Page 21 of 22

studied.  
2.1.2.1 Incidence  and Impact of Sub-Clinical Inflammation  
A retrospective analysis of 380 consecutive 6-month surveillance kidney transplant biopsies at UCSF Medical Center 
between 7/2009-5/2011 scored by a single pathologist using the revised Ba nff 2007 classification (Solez K, 2008)  found 
subclinical borderline change as defined by Banff, in 20.3%, and inflammation (Banff i1 -i2) with minor or  no tubulitis (t0 
or t1) in 10.9% of all biopsies without acute rejection ( Table 1). 
Table 1. 6-month protocol biopsies* at UCSF sorted by inflammation (i) and tubulitis (t) scores  
Banff Category  t0 t1 t2 t3 Total  
i0 261 (68.7%)  41 (10.8%)  1 (0.3%)  0 303 (79.7%)  
i1 9 (2.4%)  23 (6.1%)  2 (0.5%)  0 34 (8.9%)  
i2 1 (0.3%  8 (2.1%)  0 0 8 (2.4%)  
i3 0 3 (0.8%)  0 0 3 (0.8%)  
Total  271 (71.3%)  75 (9.7%)  3 (0.8%)  0 349 (91.8%)  
*Note: Of a total of 380 six -month biopsies, 31 had acute rejection meeting Banff criteria. Numbers in parentheses are 
percentages of all 380 biopsies. 
In this analysis, chronic graft injury was significantly associated with the presence of inflammation. Banff ci -scores  ≥1 
(representing interstitial fibrosis) and ct -scores  ≥1 (representing tubular atrophy) were significantly  more common in 
biopsies with inflammation than those without (62% vs. 14% for ci -score, p -value <0.0001; 78% vs. 53% for ct -score, p -
value <0.0001). Additionally, inflammation was associated with lower eGFR by the  Modification of Diet in Renal Disease 
(MDRD) equation (Levey AS, 1999)at 6 months (60 vs. 67 ml/min/1.73 m2, p -value <0.0001) and at 12 months (58 vs. 68 
ml/min/1.73 m2, p -value <0.0001). Our findings are very simil ar to those  seen in a study of 151 low risk, living -donor 
kidney transplant recipients on a CNI- based regimen (Park WD, 2010) . In this  study, 13.2% of 1-year protocol biopsies 
showed fibrosis with inflammation and these patient s on follow -up exhibited a decline in GFR and reduced graft survival.  
In our cohort, a follow up biopsy was performed 6 months later in 23 recipients who were found to have  subclinical 
rejection or borderline change on their 6 -month protocol biopsy. At 12  months, persistent  inflammation was seen in 
over 56.5% despite treatment, which included methylprednisolone pulse, Thymoglobulin and IVIg for subclinical 
rejection and oral prednisone pulse for those with borderline change.  Therefore, it appears that SCI,  which has been 
demonstrated to be damaging to the graft in the long-term, may  persist despite conventional therapy and potentially 
lead to a long -term decline in graft function. 
2.1.2.2 Rationale and Experience with Multiplexed Immunofluorescence and in situ Hybr idization 
for Detection of Graft Inflammation 
The Banff classification (Banff in brief), based on semiquantitative assessment of morphologic changes including 
inflammation, is considered the “gold standard” for evaluation of kidney transplant biopsies. How ever, the lack of 
qualitative information on the composition of the inflammation, imprecise quantification, and poor inter -observer 
reproducibility, make Banff a suboptimal tool for research. Since precise quantitative assessment of the inflammation in 
our study is essential to monitor treatment -related changes in follow -up biopsies, we have developed a quantitative 
immunofluorescence (IF) assay in formalin-fixed paraffin -embedded (FFPE) tissues combined with whole slide digital 
imaging and computer -assiste d image analysis to measure the inflammatory load. The application of novel multiplex IF 
technologies also allows us to perform a detailed qualitative assessment of the inflammation in the biopsies.

TASK                                                Version 11.0 / January 11, 2022  Multiplex immunofluorescence (IF) assays to measure inflammation quantitatively and qualitatively: To take advantage 
of better morphology of FFPE tissues and easy multiplexing capabilities of IF, we developed various sets of IF stains on 
FFPE kidney biopsies using a combination of inflammatory cell markers to measure inflammation (1) quantitatively and 
(2) qualitatively. The total inflammatory load is measured by using leukocyte common antigen (LCA) as a marker while the composition of the inflammation is a ssessed via multiplexing including CD8, CD4, FoxP3, CD20, and CD68 markers, 
among others. Validation of the LCA assay revealed excellent reproducibility and repeatability. Twenty -eight  serially cut 
sections of transplant kidney biopsies were stained with LCA. Whole slide digital images were generated from each 
section and the signals were quantitated in each section. The average values from the corresponding consecutive 
sections stained by one operator versus those stained by another operator were statistic ally analyzed. No significant 
differences in LCA expression were noted in any of the corresponding sections.  
Multiplex IF and in situ hybridization (miFish) stains on FFPE tissues: Immunohistochemistry (IH)/IF is often hampered by 
subpar sensitivity and sp ecificity of certain antibodies that are difficult to validate. In some cases, the low -level 
expression of antigens, such as seen with certain cytokines, makes immunohistochemical detection of these antigens 
difficult or impossible. As an alternative to IH/IF, we have adapted the RNAScope® in situ hybridization (ISH) platform to 
analyze FFPE biopsies for mRNA expression. This is a novel and highly sensitive ISH technology with very high specificity. 
To determine the cellular source of mRNA (IL -6) expression, we applied multiplex IF stains, similar to that described 
above, to the same sections that the ISH was performed on. We conclude that multiplex IF stains can be performed following ISH hybridization. The quality of both the ISH and multiplex IF signals is sufficient to apply computer -assisted 
image analysis tools for quantitation  
 Rationale  for Selection  of Investigational  Product or Intervention 
 Treg Manufacturing  
UCSF has developed a GMP -compliant process for producing polyTregs ( Putnam, 2009) .  This process starts by purifying  
CD4+CD25+CD127lo Tregs from peripheral blood or leukapheresis product  using single–step fluorescence activated cell 
sorting (FACS) for CD4+CD25+CD127lo cells or sequential magnetic activated cell sorting (MACS) to enrich for CD25+ cells 
followed by FACS purification of CD4+CD127lo cells.  The p urified Tregs are stimulated twice with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 
beads on day 0 and day 9, leading to 300 to 3000-fold expansions in a 14 -day period. Up to 5 billion polyTregs can be 
produced from one unit of blood. The expanded Tregs retain their phenotype and are highly suppressive in vitro. Tregs 
manufactured using this protocol have been infused into 14 type 1 diabetes patients in an UCSF -led trial. To determine if 
this process can be used to expand Tregs from immunosuppressed kidney transplant patients, we have recently 
expanded Tregs isolated from transplant recipients receiving tacrolimus and MPA. As shown in Fi gure 1, Tregs from this 
immunosuppressed patient expanded comparably to Tregs from non -transplant patients who were not receiving 
immunosuppressive therapy. Post expansion flow cytometric analysis shows that the expanded CD4+ T cells are uniformly CD25+ an d FOXP3+. Thus, it is feasible to expand polyTregs from patients on immunosuppression.

 Preclinical Experience  
Tregs are a small subset of CD4+ T cells that depend on the FOXP3 transcription factor for their lineage differentiation 
and function. They function by preventing the initiation of unwanted immune activation and by suppressing ongoing immune responses to limit bystander tissue destruction. Thus, Tregs are a natural part of an immune response, essential 
for resolving the associated inflammation. In kidney transplantation, acute rejections as well as borderline change are 
often associated with an increase of Tregs in the graft (Muthukumar T, 2005)  (Taflin C N. D., 2010)  and it has been 
suggested that Treg recruitment at the acute phase of the allogeneic response can diminish the interstitial inflammati on 
and reverse the rejection. Thus, infusion of Tregs before extensive graft damage may improve long- term graft outcomes 
(Bluestone, 2004)  (Kang, 2007)  (Long, 2009)  (Sagoo, 2008)  (Waldmann, 2008)  (Walsh, 2004)  (Wood, 2003) . Unlike 
generalized immunosuppressive regimens, Tregs are long-lived and can function in a dominant and antigen specific manner. Thus, therapeutic infusion of Tregs has the potential to induce long- term donor -specific tolerance without 
impeding desired immune responses to pathogens and tumors i n transplant patients.   
Preclinical studies have demonstrated that Tregs can be used to control alloimmune responses in graft -versus host -
disease (GvHD) as well as organ and cell transplantation models. Treg reactivity, dosing, adjunct immunosuppression, and timing of Treg infusion critically impact the efficacy of Treg therapy in organ transplantation (Wood, 2003) . Tregs 
enriched for donor alloantigen reactivity are more effective than polyclonal Tregs. Most mouse experiments have evaluated Treg therapy without adjunct immunosuppression and administered Tregs at the time of transplantation. However, the peri-transplant period is not the ideal time for Treg therapy because the high intensity 
immunosuppression used at this time may antagonize Tregs and inflammation triggered by surgical trauma and ischemia 
reperfusion may destabilize Tregs. In addition, the complexity of the peri -transplant period may render it difficult to 
assess the safety profile of Treg therapy. Therefore, we favor the use of Tregs when patients are more stable at least 
several months after transplant. Results from mouse models show that delayed administration of Tregs is effective at 
inducing long -term drug -free graft survival when the recipients are initially  treated with depleting agents or mTOR 
inhibitors (Fan Z, 2010)  (Raimondi, 2010) .

 Clinical Studies  
A key advance for Treg therapy in humans is the finding that human Tregs can be isolated and expan ded in vitro while 
maintaining their immunoregulatory function. As of mid-2013, 1 case study and 2 clinical trials evaluating the safety and 
efficacy of Tregs in treating GvHD have been reported, all demonstrating promising safety and potential efficacy pr ofiles 
(Brunstein, 2011)  (Di lanni, 2011)  (Trzonkowski, 2009) . These studies treated bone marrow transplant recipients with 
Tregs obtained from the bone marrow or third -party  donors. A total of 53 patients were treated with Treg doses ranging 
from 3 to 6 x 106 Tregs/kg body weight. A more recent trial infused 10 -20 x 106/kg ex vivo expanded 
CD3+CD4+CD25hiCD127- Tregs in children with recent onset type 1 diabetes and found the treatment well tolerated and 
associated with preservation of C -peptide 6 months after the infusion (Marek -Trzonkowska N, 2012) . In a study in type 1 
diabetes at UCSF, Bluestone and colleagues have performed a dose escalation study treating 1 4 patients. Patients 
showed no signs of a serious safety signal. Persistence of infused Tregs at 6 months  after infusion; and pr eservation of C-
peptide as long as 2 years after infusion have been observed.  
 Rationale  for Timing of Treg  Infusion  
The choice of introducing the Tregs 3-7 months after transplantation  offers multiple advantages over therapy at the time 
of surgery or early after transplantation. By delaying the administration of Tregs, we avoid the effect of induction 
therapy (especially the clearly detrimental effect of the anti-IL -2R antibodies) and the high exposure of CNIs that is 
required early post -transplant. The cho ice of using patients with inflammation will allow direct assessment of  impact of 
Tregs on the graft in the follow up biopsy at 2 weeks and at 6 months after the therapy. In addition , it is safer to convert 
to an mTOR inhibitor to provide Tregs the optimum environment for in vivo expansion and durability  later post -
transplant .  
 Rationale for Dose Selection  
The Treg dose was chosen by considering three primary factors: estimated effective dose, previous experiences in 
human patients, and manufacturing capacity.  
 
The effective dose of Treg therapy for reversing inflammation in allografts is currently unknown.  Based on preclinical 
studies of Treg therapy in transplantation, we estimate that inducing transplant tolerance would require m ore than 50 x 
109 of polyTregs. This dose may be reduced by an order of magnitude by depleting T cells, using Treg-supportive 
immunosuppression, or the avoidance of the highly inflammatory conditions during the period immediately following the transplant  (Tang Q, 2012) . Therefore, we estimate that 5 x 10
9 polyTregs will likely to have an impact of the anti -
graft response.  
 Among all the published studies of Treg therapy in humans, the highest dose infused is 6 x 10
6/kg polyTregs in adults for 
GvHD prevention (Di lanni, 2011)  and 20 x 106/Kg polyTregs in children with type 1 diabetes (Marek-Trzonkowska N, 
2012) .  A phase 1 polyTreg therapy trial completed enrollment and infusion in October 2013 at UCSF.  A total of 14 
patients with recent onset of type 1 diabetes were infused in the highest dosing cohort receiving 2.6 x 109 total Tregs 
(equivalent to 37 x 106/kg).   
 
As of January 2017, three kidney transplant recipients with subclinical inflammation 6 to 7 months after transplant were 
enrolled in a pilot trial and received 320 x 106 polyTregs at UCSF.  All patients have completed 1 year of follow up after 
the infusion of polyTregs.  None of the patients had an infusion reaction.  The first patient experienced transient 50% 
reduction of all leukocyte counts that began 4 days after Treg infusion and resolved by 28 days after infusion.  The patient was completely asymptomatic during this period.  The protocol biopsy taken 2 weeks after Treg infusion showed 
complete resolution of the subclinical inflammation.  It is unclear whether leukopenia and clearance of inflammation is

TASK                                                Version 11.0 / January 11, 2022  related to polyTregs infusion in this patient.  Leukopenia was not observed in any of the type 1 diabetes patients that 
received up to 2.6 x 109 polyTregs manufactured in the same facility.  However, it is possible that 320 x 106 polyTregs of 
polyTregs may have a biological impact when given to patients who are also on triple immunosuppression re gimen 
consisted of CNI, MMF, and steroids.  Of note, leukopenia was not seen in the 2nd and 3rd patients in this trial.  None of 
the patients experienced any treatment related serious AEs.  
We plan  to infus e 550 ± 450 x 106 of polyTregs to patients enrolled in this trial.   This dose is higher than targeted earlier 
in this protocol.  At the time when this protocol was first implemented, we planned to compare the efficacy of polyclonal vs donor alloreactive Tregs and wished to keep Treg dose the same between the two arms in order to make a 
rigorous comparison.  Given that the donor alloreactive Treg arm has been discontinued, we do not have any reason to 
limit the target dose in the polyTreg arm; especially since a higher dose is expected to have more biologic activity  
(Battaglia M., 2005).  We have chosen a target dose of 550 ± 450 x 10
6 polyTregs because it is within the range that has 
been safely infused in humans (Bluestone J., 2015) , is highly feasible to produce, and provides the best chance of 
efficacy.  
 Rationale for Everolimus  
The mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway integrates diverse environmental inputs, including immune signals and metabolic cues, to direct T cell fate decisions  (H, 2012) . In the Treg compartment, the Akt -mTOR axis is widely 
acknowledged as a crucial negative regulator of Treg de novo  differentiation  (Haxhinasto S, 2008)  (Sauer S, 2008)  (Liu G,  
2009)  (Liu G Y. K., 2010)  and population expansion  (Battaglia M, 2005) . In contrast to CNIs, sirolimus, an mTOR inhibitor, 
has been shown to favor Treg expansion and survival both in vitro  (Strauss L, 2009 )  (Gallon L, 2015 )  (Bocian K, 2010)  
(Levitsky J, 2011) and in vivo (Battaglia M S. A. -H., 2006 )  (Akimova T, 2012)  
 Further, it has been shown that conversion from a CNI to an mTOR inhibitor in transplant recipients is associated with an 
increase in Treg number and activity (Carroll RP, 2013 )  (Gallon L T. O. -R., 2015) . Animal studies of tolerance induction 
using Treg infusions have used shown prolonged survival of infused Tregs  (Singh K, 2014 ) and graft acceptance with 
concomitant sirolimus therapy   (Ma A, 2011)  (Ma A Q. S., 2009) . Therefore, as an added strategy to improve the survival 
of the infused Tregs, we propose to convert the maintenance immunosuppression from a CNI-based regimen to an 
everolimus-based regimen in eligible subjects who have safely received polyTregs infusions and have demonstrated a 
reduction in inflammation on their follow up biopsies at 2 weeks. The previous experiences at UCSF in patients with type 
1 diabetes mellitus as well as in a pilot study involving kidney transplant recipients found that infused Tregs reach a peak in the circulation at 2 weeks post -infusion and are still detectable in the circulation at 6 months and 1 year. In animal 
models, trafficking of infused Tregs in inflamed tissue and draining lymph nodes can be seen within a few hours after infusion.  The reduction of inflammatory cell load can be detected in three days, but is typically more pronounced 1 to 2 weeks after the Treg infusion (Lee K, 2014)  (Mahne AE, 2015) . This delay is likely because Tregs need to accumulate, 
become activated, and proliferate locally before exerting their suppressive effects.  In the clinical setting when we cannot frequently sample the graft, we th ink it is most likely that we will observe an improvement in graft inflammation 
at 2 weeks  and this will be our signal to initiate a conversion from a CNI to everolimus . Previous studies in kidney 
transplant recipients have adequately demonstrated the safety of conversion from CNI to everolimus at > 6 months post -transplant  (Budde K & Investigators., 2012)  (Chhabra D, 2013) .

 Study Design 
 Description  of Study Design   
This is an open -label trial to  determine the safety and efficacy of a single dose of autologous polyTregs in renal 
transplant recipients with SCI in the 3-7 months  post -transplant allograft biopsy compared to control patients treated 
with CNI-based immunosuppression . The  efficacy of the Treg therapy will be assessed by the reduction of graft 
inflammation on biopsies performed at 7 months  after study group allocation compared to the eligibility biopsy .  The 
original study design included an additional treatment arm with a single dose of darTregs.  However, due to the inability 
to manufacture an adequate number of cells for infusion, this treatment arm was removed from the study in protocol 
version 9.0.  One subject was treated in the darTreg arm and completed follow -up prior to the arm being removed from 
the protocol.  The accrual goal for the study was reduced due to the removal of this arm as well as challenges associated with recruitment of participants in the setting of the COVID -19 pandemic. Given that this is primarily a pilot, proof -of-
concept, we believe that the target of 7 evaluable participants in each arm is sufficient to provide the necessary clinical 
and mechanistic data that will allow us to assess the impact of polyTregs on graft inflammation.  
The study will also describe the safety of mTOR therapy after polyTregs.  The secondary efficacy endpoint, as well as 
safety and mechanistic endpoints relative to both Tregs and mTOR therapy are described below.

 Secondary Efficacy  Endpoints 
The secondary efficacy endpoint  will be the proportion of subjects exhibiting a relative decrease of 25% or more 
inflammation between the baseline kidney biopsy and the biopsy 2 weeks after polyTregs, measured as the percentage  
area of cortex occupied by  inflammatory cells using computer -assisted quantitative image analysis. 
Additional secondary efficacy endpoints are the proportion of subjects who exhibit a relative decrease of 50% or more 
inflammation on kidney biopsy at 2 weeks after polyTregs; and the proportion of subjects who exhibit a relative 
decrease of 25% or more inflammation at 7 months after study group allocation. 
 Primary Mechanistic  Endpoints  
The primary mechanistic endpoints are the immunologic profiles of kidney transplant recipients using the common 
response module (CRM) g raft gene expression of rejection and/or histologic evidence of inflammation  in biopsies at 2 
weeks after infusion (Group 2)  and 7 months after study group allocation (Group s 1 and 2). 
 Secondary  Mechanistic  Endpoints  
The secondary mechanisti c endpoints are the immunologic profiles of kidney transplant recipients using:  
 Persistence of infused Tregs in blood and biopsies using deuterium labeling and T cell repertoire analysis (Group 2)  
2. Cytokine and CRM mRNA and protein profiles in the urine as correlates of acute rejection and/or histologic evidence 
of inflammation and graft fibrosis (Group s 1 and 2)  
3. Peripheral blood (kidney solid organ response test) kSORT mRNA  expression of rejection/ increased immune 
response (Group s 1 and 2) 
 Strati fication , Study Group Allocation, and Blinding /Masking 
This is an open label , parallel group study in which subjects are assigned to treatment alternatives in an unblinded 
fashion using a variation of the Pocock and Simon adaptive randomization strategy.  A web -based randomization system 
will be used in order to minimize the possibility of bias entering into those assignments and to maintain approximate 
equality in the group sizes.  The initial treatment allocation will weight each treatment equally.  In su bsequent 
allocations, the less -populated arm will be weighted more in order to restore the balance between the groups.  If a 
recipient is assigned to polyTreg and the recipient does not receive intended polyTreg infusion, that recipient will be re-
assigned  to Group 1.  The allocation schedule algorithm/scheme will not incorporate stratification variables.

 Rationale for Study Population 
Adult recipients of kidney transplants with stable graft function who are found to have inflammation with or without 
minor tubulitis on a 6 -month surveillance biopsy will be eligible for the trial.  Inflammation in the renal allograft is well -
recognized as a predictor of long-term  graft dysfunction and graft loss (  (Park WD, 2010) ; (Mannon RB M. A., 2010) ). 
Patients who are found to have inflammation on the 6 -month surveillance biopsy have already received maximal 
treatment with induction therapy and are maintained on dual or triple immunosuppression, so more intense therapy may not control the inflammation and is often associated with drug -induced toxicities. Currently, these patients do not 
receive any specific intervention to treat the inflammation despite the future risk of graft dysfunction. These patients 
are therefore excellent candidates for immunomodulatory therapy that can alter the balance of the immune system 
towards a more regulatory phenotype and lead to better long-term function.

 Investigational Agent : PolyTregs  
 Formulation  of PolyTregs 
Collection of Recipient T cells  
Peripheral blood leukocytes will be collected from eligible participants  after eligibility is confirmed.  The whole blood or 
leukapheresed cells will be immediately transported to the manufacturing facility.  If the whole blood or leukapheresis 
product does not produce sufficient numbers of Tregs  for infusion , the leukapheresis or phlebotomy may  be repeated to 
ensure an adequate  initial cell number for product manufacture.  
PolyTregs  Expansion 
Treg isolat ed from autologous starting material will be  expanded with commercially available anti-CD3 and anti -CD28 
magnetic bead  for 14 days in culture s containing  medium supplemented with deuterated glucose .  Blood or 
leukapheresis product from recipients participating at a clinical site other than  UCSF will be shipped at room 
temperature via next -day service to UCSF for further processing.   
 Packaging and Labeling  of PolyTregs  
At the end of the 14- day expansion  of polyTregs , the anti -CD3 and anti-CD28 beads will be removed  by magnetic 
separation.   The expanded Tregs will be re-suspended in 100 ml of a solution of 49.02% (v/v) PlasmaLyte -A, 49.02% (v/v) 
Dextrose 5%, 0.45% NaCl, and 1.96% (v/v) 25% human serum albumin and filled in a sterile infusion bag.  The filled 
product  will be refrigerated and quarantined until release.  
Prior to release, a product label will be affixed on the infusion bag.  The label will provide:  the unique product  identifi er, 
recommended storage temperature, date of cell harvest, expiration date and  time, and clearly indicate the name and 
unique identifier of the intended recipient.  A Certificate of Analysis documenting the test results of release assays will 
accompany the final product during delivery to the bedside. 
The Tregs  product s manufactured for subjects at an off-site location will be shipped from UCSF to the clinical site via 
next -day service using validated conditions and containers.  Qualified staff at the remote site will receive the polyTregs 
and verify  the recorded shipment temperature s were maintained within the validated range  according to UCSF 
established SOPs. 
 Dosage, Preparation, and Administration 
Subjects randomized to Group 2 will receive a single infusion of 550 ±450 x 106 polyTregs.  Preparations less than 100 x 
106 will not be infused.  Cells not infused will be used for research.  
Pre-medications will be administered 30 -60 minutes prior to infusion.  Pre-medications will include 650 mg 
acetaminophen and 25 -50 mg diphenhydramine intravenously or by mouth.   
After dou ble verification of cell therapy product and recipient identification, the product will be infused via a peripheral 
intravenous (IV) line primed with saline by gravity in approximately 20 to 30 minutes. Following administration of the 
Treg product, product  bag, tubing and peripheral IV line will be flushed with normal saline to ensure the complete dose 
is infused.  
Vitals signs will be monitored before, during, and after the infusion. Emergency medical equipment will be available 
during the infusion in case the subject has an allergic response or an infusion reaction that can result in a CRS. The IV line

of 24 hours which will allow ongoing monitoring for any infusion -related signs and symptoms. 
 Drug Accountability  
Under Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations (21CFR §312.62) the investigator will maintain adequate records of the 
disposition of the investigational agent, including the d ate and quantity of the  drug received, to whom the drug was 
dispensed (participant -by-participant accounting), and a detailed accounting of any drug accidentally or deliberately 
destroyed.  
Records for receipt, storage, use, and disposition will be maintained by the study site.  A drug -dispensing log will be kept 
current for each participant.  This log will contain the identification of each participant and the date and quantity of drug dispensed.  
All records regarding the disposition of the investigational product will be available for inspection.

Due to manufacturing constraints, there will be a naturally imposed waiting period of at least 1 week in between infusions.  This will provide a window to delay or cancel the  next  infusion in case a stopping rule has been met.  Other 
than the 1-week manufa cturing delay, there will be no mandated waiting period between infusions in the polyTregs 
treatment arm  (Group 2) , since the proposed starting dose has been infused safely previously in kidney transplant 
recipients. 
 Premature  Discontinuation of PolyTregs 
PolyTregs will be stopped and will not be restarted if there is a hypersensitivity reaction, a CTCAE ≥  3 infusion -related 
reaction, a CTCAE Grade ≥  3 CRS, or any other infusion related serious adverse event.

TASK                                                Version 11.0 / January 11, 2022  
 Investigational Immunosuppressive Regimen: Evero limus   
At the time of Treg infusion, the maintenance immunosuppression will consist  of tacrolimus with target levels of 4 -11 
µg/L, MMF/MPA ± steroids. On the follow -up biopsy 2 weeks after the poly Treg infusion, the inflammatory load will  be 
assessed by co mputer assisted image analysis calculating the number of infiltrating cells per square mm as  well as the 
percentage of renal cortex infiltrated with lymphocytes. If the inflammation has resolved on the 2 week follow up biopsy 
as compared to the baseline bi opsy , everolimus will be started at 1.5 mg bid and the dose of tacrolimus reduced by 50% 
for 4 weeks and  then discontinued .  Target everolimus trough levels will be 3 -8 µg/L with concomitant tacrolimus 
therapy, and 6 -10 µg/L once tacrolimus is discontinued.  These patients will remain on everolimus, MPA ± prednisone 
through the end of the trial  and the follow -up period. If on the 2 -week follow up biopsy, inflammation is still present 
(even if reduced in intensity compared to the baseline biopsy) , no change will be made to the maintenance 
immunosuppressive regimen.  
 Zortress ® (Everolimus ) 
Zortress ® is an mTOR inhibitor immunosuppressant manufactured by Novartis Pharmaceutical s Corporation and is 
commercially available.  Zortress ® is FDA licensed for the prophylaxis of kidney transplant rejection in adults with low to 
moderate immunologic risk.     
 Formulation , Packaging , and Labeling   
Everolimus is a macrolide immunosuppressant.  Everolimus inhibits antigenic and interleukin (IL -2 and IIL -15) stimulated 
activation and proliferation of T and B lymphocytes.  Everolimus is supplied as tablets for oral administration containing 
0.25 mg, 0.5 mg, and 0.75 mg of everolimus together with butylated hydroxytoluene, magnesium sterate, lactose 
monohydrate, hypromellose, crospovidone, and lactose anhydrous as inactive ingredients.  
Zortress® tablets are packed in child-resistant blisters.  Each strength is available in boxes of 60 tablets (6 blister strips of 
10 tablets each).  Tablets are white to yellowish, marbled, round, and flat with beveled edges.   Tablets should be stored 
at 25°C (77°F) with excursions permitted to 15-30°C (50-86°F).  Tablets should be protected from light and moisture. 
 Zortress® Prescribing Information (Per Package Insert)  
According to the package insert, Zortress® is to be used in combination with basilixamab induction and concurrently with reduced doses of cyclosporine and corticosteroids.  An initial everolimus dose of 0.75 mg orally twice daily (1.5 
mg/day) is recommended for adult kidney transplant patients in combination with reduced dose cyclosporine, 
administered as soon as possible after transplantation.  Pharmacokinetic studies in kidney transplant patients sh ow that 
steady -state of everolimus is reached by Day 4.  The recommended therapeutic range for everolimus is 3 to 8 ng/mL.  
Recommended cyclosporine blood concentrations are recommended as follows:  100 -200 ng/mL through 1 month after 
transplant, 75 -150 ng /mL at 2 and 3 months after transplant, 50 -100 ng/mL at 4 months after transplant, and 25 -50 
ng/mL from 6 months to 12 months after transplant.  Dose adjustments based on everolimus blood concentrations can be made at 4 -5 day intervals.   
 Everolimus Study Dosing and Administration  
The use of everolimus in this trial will deviate from package instructions.  Subjects in this trial are enrolled between 3 and 7  months after transplantation and induction therapy is site-specific (not study mandated) .  Furthermor e, subjects 
will be on tacrolimus at study entry, rather than cyclosporine.  In eligible patients, everolimus will be initiated within 2  
weeks after kidney biopsy showing resolution of inflammation  following Treg infusion. Everolimus will be initiated at a 
dose of 1.5 mg orally twice daily and titrated, as needed.  Subjects will begin everolimus with target trough levels of 3-8

discontinued . 
 Assessment of Participant Compliance with mTOR and CNI Dosing  
Study subjects will have, at a minimum, w eekly monitoring of trough levels.  
 Toxicity Prevention  and Management  
In subjects who develop any of the following conditions after initiation of everolimus therapy, everolimus will be 
discontinued and tacrolimus will be restarted. Target tacrolimus trough levels will be 4 -11 mcg/L.  
1. Worsening of proteinuria with urine pr/cr >1 g/g  
2. Severe hypercholesterolemia (LDL>190 mg/dL or triglycerides >500 mg/d L) not responsive to therapy with lipid 
lowering agents  
3. Severe edema or fluid accumulations such as pleural or pericardial effusions  
4. Interstitial pneumonitis  
5. Severe mouth ulcers  
6. Severe cytopenia  (CTCAE grade 3 or higher) not responsive to dose adjustment of everolimus or MMF/ MPA  
7. Any condition which in the determination of the investigator requires discontinuation of everolimus therapy 
such as planned surgery.     
 Rejection after  Initiation of Everolimus  
Any subject with biopsy proven or treated r ejection after the start of study mandated everolimus will discontinue 
everolimus and resume tacrolimus.  Target tacrolimus trough level s will be 4 -11 mcg/L.

 Other Medications  
 Immunosuppressive  Medica tions  
 Tacrolimus 
Target  tacrolimus  trough levels for this study prior to conversion to everolimus are 4-11 µ g/dl, which falls within 
standard of care.   For eligible subjects in Group 2, the tacrolimus dose will be reduced by 50% when everolimus is 
initiate d.  Tacrolimus will be discontinued 4 weeks after initiation of everolimus therapy .    
7.1.2 Mycophenolate  Mofetil/ Mycophenolic Acid  
All enrolled subjects will be on MMF/MPA at the time of study entry at a minimum dose of 1000 mg/720 mg per day. 
Once subjects are enrolled in the study, doses may be adjusted at the discretion of the study investigator for 
gastrointestinal intolerance, cy topenias, infections or other conditions that require dose adjustment.  All mycophenolate 
prescribers in the study will be required to enroll in the FDA mycophenolate REMS (risk evaluation and mitigation 
strategy) program.        
7.1.3 Prednisone  
Use of corticosteroids is not prohibited in this trial.  However, subjects requiring use of corticosteroids >10 mg per day for treatment of long -term conditions ( e.g.,  lupus) will not be enrolled.  
7.1.4 Other Immunosuppressive  Medications  
Subjects requiring the use of cyclosp orine and/or azathioprine will not be enrolled in this study.  
 Anti -Infective  Prophylactic  Medications  
Anti-infective prophylaxis medications will be per standard of care at each clinical center.  
 Prohibited Medications  
 Non-Leukoreduced Blood Products  
For subjects requiring treatment, leukoreduced blood products should be used whenever possible. 
 Vaccinations  
The use of live vaccines will be proscribed during trial participation, as per standard of care for kidney transplant recipients. Examples include (but are not limited to) the following: intranasal influenza, measles, mumps, rubella, oral 
polio, BCG, yellow fever, varicella, and TY21a typhoid vaccines.  
Subjects should not receive any vaccination (live or inactivated) within 14 days prior to blood collection for Treg 
manufacturing and 28 days after the date of Treg infusion.  These requirements are in place to minimize the chance of 
having enrichment of vaccine specific  Tregs in the product and ensure that Treg infusion does not negatively impact 
immunity elicited by the vaccine.  
 Medication Interactions  
Grapefruit and grapefruit juice inhibit cytochrome P450 3A4 and P-gp activity and should therefore be avoided with 
concomitant use of EVR. Patients with rare hereditary problems of  galactose intolerance, the Lapp lactase deficiency or 
glucose-galactose mal absorption should not take EVR as this may result in diarrhea and malabsorption.

should be carefully monitored and dosing titrated to maintain the target levels to minimize toxicity while maintaining 
efficacy.  
 Treatment  of Rejection  
Patients who are clinically suspected to have a rejection will undergo a kidney biopsy. Biopsies will be read locally 
according to the Banff criteria and if acute rejection is diagnosed, it will be treated according to the current standard of care. Samples of blood, urine and kidney tissue will be obtained for mechanistic analysis prior to the treatment. Digital 
images of the biopsies will also be reviewed later by the central pathology core.

 Study Mandated Procedures  
 Blood  Draws 
Blood draws are necessary after kidney transplantation to monitor allograft function .  Whenever possible, s tudy 
participants will have additional blood drawn for research purposes at time points when standard of care testing is done.  
Some blood tests will be performed at the local hospital laboratory.  Blood for mechanistic assays described in this 
protocol will als o be collected and shipped to core laboratories.   
A blood collection of 4 50-500 mls will be drawn for Treg isolation and manufacture for subjects with hematocrit 30%  or 
higher once the subject is determined to be eligible and randomized to Group 2.  Blood collection for this purpose can 
be repeated once, if necessary, for manufacture of the Treg product  (see 8.2 Leukapheresis) .   
 Leukapheresis   
Subjects with hematocrit less than 30% will have leukapheresis performed for PBMC collection.  Subjects with 
hematocrit greater than 30% may undergo leukapheresis or have whole blood collection.  The study team will make a decision in the best interest of a particular subject based on the current clinical picture.      
 Kidney  Biopsy  
Study participants will undergo surveillance biopsies as standard of care between 3 and 7 months after transplantation  
and approximately one year  after transplantation.  Research specimens will be collected during these procedures and 
digital images will be sent to the central  pathol ogist for scoring .  The biopsy  obtained 3 -7 months after transplantation  
will be used to determine study eligi bility and local read will be confirmed by central pathologist.  The one -year biopsy 
will fall 7 months after study group assignment and will be u sed to assess the efficacy endpoint . The one -year biopsy and 
all for -cause biopsies will be reviewed by the central pathologist .     
Additionally, a protocol ki dney biopsy will be performed 2 weeks after poly Treg infusi on (Group 2) .  This biops y is for 
research purposes only and will be used for mechanistic assays and to confirm eligibility for mTOR conversion. This 
biopsy will be reviewed by the central pathologist.

 Known  and Potential Risks  and Benefits to Participants 
 Risks of PolyTregs  
Although Treg infusion has been innocuous in animal models, there is currently scant experience in humans. Three Treg 
therapy trials in GvHD have been reported. The first -in-man trial by Trzonkowski et al involved two patients 
(Trzonkowski, 2009). The firs t patient had chronic GvHD two years after transplantation. After receiving 0.1 x 106/Kg 
flow sorted ex vivo expanded Tregs from the donor, the symptoms subsided,  and the patient was successfully 
withdrawn from IS. The second patient had acute GvHD disease that progressed despite three infusions with an 
accumulative dose of 3 x 106/Kg expanded donor Tregs. A larger scale phase I trial led by Brunstein et al (Brunstein, 
2010) enrolled twenty- three patients with advanced hematologic malignancy. The patients were treated with two units 
of umbilical cord blood as source of stem cells and effector T cells. Tregs were isolated using anti-CD25 immunomagnetic 
bead selection from third -party cord blood samples that had 4 to 6 HLA match with the recipient. Up to 6 x 106/Kg Tregs 
were infused after ex vivo expansion using anti -CD3 and anti-CD28 conjugated beads.  The infused Tregs were detectible 
in circulation for up to 7 days. During the one-year period after Treg infusion, the investigators observed no DLTs and AEs when compared to historical controls. Incidences of acute and chronic GvHD were reduced in patients received Treg 
therapy. The third trial enrolled 28 patients with high -risk hematological malignancies (Di lanni, 2011). Patients received 
anti-CD25 immunomagnetic bead enriched donor Tregs without ex vivo expansion four days before receiving one haplo -
mismatched hematopoietic stem cell and Tconv transplants from the same donors. A majority of the patients received 2 x 106/Kg Tregs with 1 x 106/Kg Tconvs and n o adjunct IS was given after transplant. Patients demonstrated accelerated 
immune reconstitution, reduced CMV reactivation, low incidence of tumor relapse and GvHD. Collectively, these studies show that Treg therapy has minimal toxicity in the setting of GvHD.  
Recently, a phase I/II study applying polyclonally expanded FACS purified Tregs to type diabetic patients has been 
reported by the Trzonkowski group (Marek-Trzonkowska N, 2012). The study enrolled 10 type 1 diabetic children (aged 
8-16 years) within 2 months after diagnosis. Four patients received 10 × 10
6 Tregs/kg body wt and the remaining 6 
patients received 20 × 106 Tregs/kg body w eigh t. The patients were followed for 4 -5 months after Treg infusion,  and no 
toxicity of the therapy was noted. The authors concluded that Treg therapy was safe and well tolerated in children.  
A phase I Treg dose-escalating trial evaluating safety of Treg therapy in type 1 diabetic patients completed enrollment 
and infusion  in October 2013.  Fourteen enrolled  subjects received a single infusion of Tregs. Three subjects were 
treated in each of the first and second  dosing cohort s with 0.05x108 and 0.4x108 cells, respectively, and four subjects 
were treated in the third dosing cohort with 3.2x108 cells. Notably, three  of the subjects in cohort 3 and 4 were enrolled 
at treated at Yale (New Haven, Connecticut).  As of August 2014, 115 adverse events had been reported in 15 subjects 
since the beginning of the trial.  All 14 treated subjects have reported at least 1 adverse event.  One subject who 
underwent phlebotomy but was withdrawn before treated reported 1 adverse event before withdrawal from the trial. Seventy-one events were judged as mild in severity, 35 were judged as moderate, and nine were judged as severe.  Four 
events were judged to be serious. Thirty events were judged to be possibly related, 21 unlikely related and 64 unrelated 
to study therapy.  There were no grade 4 or 5 adverse events. Four serious adverse events (SAE) have been reported 
since the beginning of the trial. Three severe (grade 3) hypoglycemic SAEs, one judged unlikely related and two judged 
unrelated to the investigational product have been reported.  One severe (grade 3) hyperglycemic SAE judged unrelat ed 
to the investigational product has been reported.

TASK                                                Version 11.0 / January 11, 2022  
 Potential Risks of Treg Administration  
T cell suppression 
Tregs are known to suppress naïve T cell responses to a variety of antigens. Less is known about ongoing immune 
responses especially to viruses  and bacteria. It is not known whether Tregs will alter protective immunity. Only 
recipients with current immunizations including TdAP, pneumococcal and seasonal influenza vaccines will be enrolled in the study. During the flu season, seasonal influenza vaccine will be administered prior to the qualifying biopsy for all 
transplant recipients and at least 28 days prior to Treg isolation.  Subjects immune to hepatitis B can be enrolled in the 
study; or if non -immune/ HBV naïve, can be enrolled only if their k idney donor has negative HB core antibody and 
negative HB surface antigen.  
Infusion reaction  
Side effects reported from previous human trials involving T cell infusions include transient fever, chills, and/or nausea. 
Subjects will be pre -medicated with acetaminophen 650 mg by mouth and diphenhydramine hydrochloride 25 -50 mg by 
mouth or IV, prior to the infusion of Tregs. These medications may be repeated every six hours as needed. Patients will 
not receive systemic corticosteroids such as hydrocortisone, pr ednisone, prednisolone (Solu -Medrol) or dexamethasone 
(Decadron) at any time, except in the case of a life- threatening emergency, since this may have an adverse effect on T 
cells. If corticosteroids are required for an acute infusion reaction, an initial dose of hydrocortisone 100 mg may be used.  
Infection  
As with any therapy that suppresses the immune system, there is a risk of developing infections. It should be noted that 
on a theoretical basis, this risk is minimal, since the total input of Tregs is approximately 3 -5% of the endogenous 
resident Treg population. We will perform plasma CMV DNA quantitative PCR in all recipients prior to enrollment and 
exclude those who are positive. Study subjects will be monitored for CMV reactivation by plasma CMV DNA qu antitative 
PCR.  
Lymphoproliferative disease 
Treg immunosuppression has been shown to enhance tumor growth in some small animal model systems. Thus, complications such as lymphoproliferative disease are possible on a theoretical basis. Clinical experience in transplant recipients suggests that the ri sk of lymphoproliferative disease is highest in those who develop a primary EBV infection 
while immunosuppressed. Thus,  individuals without prior exposure to EBV are excluded from this study  unless the 
kidney donor is EBV naive.  In previously exposed indi viduals, EBV reactivation is associated with a degree of 
immunosuppression higher than that likely to be observed in this study since the total input of Tregs is approximately 3 -
5% of the endogenous resident Treg population. Furthermore, the previously obs erved rate of PTLD in kidney recipients 
is relatively low at 0.68%  (Smith JM, 2006) .  Nonetheless, careful attention will be paid to the potential for this 
complication and we will perform EBV quantitative DNA PCR to screen pat ients prior to enrollment and monitor for 
reactivation during the study .   
Loss of tumor surveillance  
T lymphocytes are one major component of tumor surveillance, and it is possible that cells that inhibit T lymphocytes 
could impair this function. There ha s not been evidence of tumors in preclinical models. Nonetheless, the long term 
follow up of all treated patients will determine whether there is evidence of an increase in the frequency of tumors.  
Reproductive risks  
There may be an unexpected risk to an unborn or nursing child. Pregnant and breastfeeding women will be excluded from participation in the study. Females must have a negative pregnancy test prior to enrolling in the study. Female participants must agree to not participate in a conception process (e.g., active attempt to become pregnant or in vitro 
CTOT-21  Confidential  Page 42 of 43  
TASK                                                Version 11.0 / January 11, 2022  fertilization) for up to one year after Treg dosing. Females must agree to use a reliable and effective form of birth control 
for two years after Treg dosing. This includes oral contraceptives, barrier  methods, or abstinence.   Female subjects will 
also be required to undergo a urine pregnancy test prior to cell administration. A positive pregnancy test will result in 
holding of scheduled cell administration.  
 Risks  of Zortress ® (Everolimus ) 
Boxed warnings for everolimus include increased susceptibility to malignancies and serious infections from immunosuppression; increased risk of kidney arterial and venous thrombosis  resulting in graft loss within 30 days post-
transplantation; increased nephrotoxicity if used with standard doses of cyclosporine; and increased mortality (associated with serious infections) within the first three months of heart transplantation.    
In this study, the period of overlap between everolimus and a CNI ( tacrolimus ) will be 4 weeks ; and during this period 
tacrolimus will be administered at a reduced dose. The risks that have been noted previously with combination therapy 
of cyclosporine and everolimus are therefore not anticipated in this trial.  Risks applicable to t he use of everolimus in 
this study include:    
Angioedema  
Everolimus has been associated with the development of angioedema. The concomitant use of everolimus with other 
drugs known to cause angioedema, such as angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor s may increase the risk.  
Wound Healing and Fluid Accumulation 
Everolimus delays wound healing and increases the occurrence of wound -related complications like wound dehiscence, 
wound infection, incisional hernia, lymphocele and seroma. These wound -related complications may require more 
surgical intervention. Generalized fluid accumulation, including peripheral edema (e.g., lymphoedema) and other types of localized fluid collection, such as pericardial and pleural effusions and ascites have also been reported. 
Hyperlipidemia 
Increased serum cholesterol and triglyceride s, requiring the need for anti -lipid therapy, have been reported to occur 
following initiation of everolimus and the risk of hyperlipidemia is increased with higher everolimus whole blood trough 
concentrations.  Use of anti -lipid therapy may not normalize lipid levels in patients receiving everolimus.  
Due to an interaction with cyclosporine, clinical trials of everolimus and cyclosporine in kidney transplant patients 
strongly discouraged patients from receiving the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors simvastatin and lovastatin. During everolimus therapy with cyclosporine, patients administered an HMG -CoA reductase inhibitor and/or fibrate should be 
monitored for the possible development of rhabdomyolysis and other adverse effects, as described in the respective labeling for these agents.  
Proteinuria 
The use of everolimus with cyclosporine in transplant patients has been associated with increased proteinuria. The risk 
of proteinuria increased with higher everolimus whole blood trough concentrations.  
Polyoma Virus I nfections  
Patients receiving immunosuppressants, including everolimus, are at increased risk for opportunistic infections; including polyoma virus infections.  Polyoma virus infections in transplant patients may have serious, and sometimes 
fatal, outcomes.   These include polyoma virus -associated nephropathy (PVAN), mostly due to BK virus infection, and JC 
virus associated progressive multiple leukoencephalopathy (PML). PVAN has been observed in patients receiving 
immunosuppressants, including everolimus.

A diagnosis of non -infectious pneumonitis should be considered in patients presenting with symptoms consistent with 
infectious pneumonia or radiologic changes in whom infectious, neoplastic and other non -drug causes have been rul ed 
out through appropriate investigations. Fatal cases have been reported. Non -infectious pneumonitis may respond to 
drug interruption with or without glucocorticoid therapy.  
Thrombotic Microangiopathy/ Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura/ Hemolytic Uremi c Syndrome (TMA/TTP/HUS) 
The concomitant use of everolimus with cyclosporine may increase the risk of thrombotic microangiopathy/thrombotic  
thrombocytopenic purpura/hemolytic uremic syndrome.  
New Onset Diabetes after  Transplant  
Everolimus has been shown to increase the risk of new onset diabetes mellitus after transplant.  
Male Infertility 
Azospermia or oligospermia may be observed.  Everolimus affects rapidly dividing cells like the germ cells  which can lead 
to reduced male fertility .  These effects are reversible with discontinuation of therapy.  
Pregnancy and Nursing  
Everolimus is a pregnancy category C drug. In animal studies, everolimus crossed the placenta and was toxic to the 
conceptus. The potential risk for humans is unknown.  Women of childbearing potential should be advised to use 
effective contraception methods while they are receiving everolimus and up to 8 weeks after treatment has been 
stopped.  Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in 
nursing infants from everolimus, women should avoid breast-feeding during treatment with everolimus.  
 Risks of Tacrolimus  and Mycophenolate Mofetil/Mycophenolic Acid  
Subjects will be on CNI and mycophenolate at the time of study entry . Potential risk s applicable to their use in this study 
are listed below. 
 Risks of Tacrolimus  
Post -Transplant Diabetes Mellitus  
Insulin -dependent post-transplant diabetes mellitus (PTDM) was reported in 20% of Prograf -treated kidney transplant 
patients without pretransplant history of diabetes mellitus in the Phase III study.  The median time to onset of PTDM 
was 68 days.  Insulin dependence was reversible in 15% of these PTDM patients at one year and in 50% at 2 years post - 
transplant.  Black and Hispanic kidney transplant patients were at an increased risk of development of PTDM. 
Nephrotoxicity  
Tacrolimus  can cause nephrotoxicity, particularly when used in high doses.  Nephrotoxicity was reported in 
approximately 52% of kidney transplantation patients and in 40% and 36% of liver transplantation patients receiving 
tacrolimus  in the U.S. and European randomized trials, respectively, and in 59% of heart transplantation patients in a 
European randomized trial.  In patients with persistent elevations o f serum creatinine who are unresponsive to dosage 
adjustments, consideration should be given to changing to another immunosuppressive therapy.  Care should be taken 
in using tacrolimus with other nephrotoxic drugs.   
Hyperkalemia  
Mild to severe hyperkalem ia was reported in 31% of kidney transplant recipients and in 45% and 13% of liver transplant 
recipients treated with tacrolimus in the U.S. and European randomized trials, respectively, and in 8% of heart transplant 
CTOT-21  Confidential  Page 44 of 45  
TASK                                                Version 11.0 / January 11, 2022  recipients in a European randomized trial and may require treatment.  Serum potassium levels should be monitored and 
potassium -sparing diuretics should not be used during tacrolimus therapy.  
Neurotoxicity  
Tacrolimus can cause neurotoxicity, particularly when used in high doses.  Neurotoxicity,  including tremor, headache, 
and other changes in motor function, mental status, and sensory function were reported in approximately 55% of liver 
transplant recipients in the two randomized studies.  Tremor occurred more often in tacrolimus -treated kidney 
transplant patients (54%) and heart transplant patients (15%) compared to cyclosporine-treated patients.  The incidence 
of other neurological events in kidney transplant and heart transplant patients was similar in the two treatment groups. 
Tremor and headache have been associated with high whole- blood concentrations of tacrolimus and may respond to 
dosage adjustment. Seizures have occurred in adult and pediatric patients receiving tacrolimus.  Coma and delirium also 
have been associated with high plasma concentrations of tacrolimus.  Patients treated with tacrolimus have been 
reported to develop posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES).  Symptoms indicating PRES include 
headache, altered mental status, seizures, visual disturbances and hypertension. Diagnosis may be confirmed by radiological procedure. If PRES is suspected or diagnosed, blood pressure control should be maintained and immediate 
reduction of immunosuppression is advised.  This syndrome is characterized by reversal of symptoms upon reduction or 
discontinuation of immunosuppression. 
Malignancy and Lymphoproliferative Disorders  
As in patients receiving other immunosuppressants, patients receiving tacrolimus are at increased risk of developing lymphomas and other malignancies, particularly of the skin.  The risk appears to be related to the intensity and duration of immunosuppression rather than to the use of any specific agent.  A lymphoproliferative disorder (LPD) related to 
Epstein -Barr Virus (EBV) infection has been reported in immunosuppressed organ transplant recipients.  The risk of LPD 
appears greatest in young children who are at risk for primary EBV infection while immunosuppressed or who are 
switched to tacrolimus following long- term immunosuppression therapy.  Because of the danger of over  suppression of 
the immune system which can increase susceptibility to infection, combination immunosuppressant therapy should be used with caution.  
Latent Viral Infections  
Immunosuppressed patients are at increased risk for opportunistic infe ctions, including activation of latent viral 
infections.  These include BK virus associated nephropathy and JC virus associated progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) which have been observed in patients receiving tacrolimus.  These infections ma y lead to 
serious, including fatal, outcomes.  
Tacrolimus in Combination with Sirolimus  
The use of full -dose tacrolimus  with sirolimus (2 mg per day) in heart transplant recipients was associated with increased 
risk of wound healing complications, renal function impairment, and insulin-dependent post -transplant diabetes 
mellitus, and is not recommended.  Study subjects will not be prescribed full -dose tacrolimus in this trial.  Rather, 
subjects will be weaned off tacrolimus once target everolimus levels hav e been reached.   
 Risks of Mycophenolate Mofetil/ Mycophenolic Acid  
Embryofetal Toxicity  
Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant female.  Use of MMF during 
pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of first tri mester pregnancy loss and an increased risk of congenital 
malformations, especially external ear and other facial abnormalities including cleft lip and palate, and anomalies of the 
distal limbs, heart, esophagus, kidney and nervous system.

TASK                                                Version 11.0 / January 11, 2022  All prescribers participating in the study will be required to enroll in the FDA mycophenolate REMS program.  Of note, all 
study participants will already have been on a maintenance regimen containing MMF/MPA and will not be started on it 
as part of the study.  All female s must be willing to use FDA approved methods of birth control acceptable during the 
entire period of the study. Urine pregnancy test is part of the screening laboratory tests and will be repeated prior to 
polyTreg infusion .   
For those females who are dis covered to be pregnant either at study screening or enrollment or during the study and 
who are on MMF/MPA or within 6 weeks of discontinuing therapy, the study investigators will report the pregnancy to the Mycophenolate Pregnancy registry (1 -800-617-8191)  and strongly encourage the patient to enroll in the pregnancy 
registry. When appropriate, pregnant patients will be switched to alternative immunosuppression with less potential for embryo -fetal toxicity after a discussion of maternal and fetal risks and benefits.  
Lymphoma and Malignancy  
Patients receiving immunosuppressive regimens involving combinations of drugs, including MMF, as part of an 
immunosuppressive regimen are at increased risk of developing lymphomas and other malignancies, particularly of t he 
skin.  The risk appears to be related to the intensity and duration of immunosuppression rather than to the use of any 
specific agent.  As usual for patients with increased risk for skin cancer, exposure to sunlight and UV light should be 
limited by wearing protective clothing and using a sunscreen with a high protection factor.  Lymphoproliferative disease 
or lymphoma developed in 0.4% to 1% of patients receiving MMF (2 g or 3 g) with other immunosuppressive agents in 
controlled clinical trials of renal, cardiac, and hepatic transplant patients.  In pediatric patients, no other malignancies 
besides lymphoproliferative disorder (2/148 patients) have been observed.  
Combination with Other Immunosuppressive Agents  
MMF has been administered in combination wi th the following agents in clinical trials: antithymocyte globulin 
(ATGAM®), OKT3 (Orthoclone OKT® 3), cyclosporine (Sandimmune®, Neoral®) and corticosteroids. The efficacy and safety of the use of MMF in combination with other immunosuppressive agents have not been determined. 
Serious Infections  
Patients receiving immunosuppressants, including MMF, are at increased risk of developing bacterial, fungal, protozoal 
and new or reactivated viral infections, including opportunistic infections.  These infections may lead to serious, 
including fatal outcomes.  Because of the danger of over suppression of the immune system which can increase 
susceptibility to infection, combination immunosuppressant therapy should be used with caution. 
New or Reactivated Viral Infections  
Polyomavirus associated nephropathy (PVAN), JC virus associated progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections, reactivation of hepatitis B (HBV) or hepatitis C (HCV) have been reported in patients 
treated wit h immunosuppressants, including MMF.  Reduction in immunosuppression should be considered for patients 
who develop evidence of new or reactivated viral infections.  Physicians should also consider the risk that reduced 
immunosuppression represents to the functioning allograft. 
PML, which is sometimes fatal, commonly presents with hemiparesis, apathy, confusion, cognitive deficiencies, and 
ataxia.  Risk factors for PML include treatment with immunosuppressant therapies and impairment of immune function. 
In immunosuppressed patients, physicians should consider PML in the differential diagnosis in patients reporting 
neurological symptoms and consultation with a neurologist should be considered as clinically indicated.  The risk of CMV 
viremia and CMV disease is  highest among transplant recipients seronegative for CMV at time of transplant who receive 
a graft from a CMV seropositive donor.  Therapeutic approaches to limiting CMV disease exist and should be routinely 
CTOT-21  Confidential  Page 46 of 47  
TASK                                                Version 11.0 / January 11, 2022  provided.  Patient monitoring may help detect p atients at risk for CMV disease.  Viral reactivation has been reported in 
patients infected with HBV or HCV.  Monitoring infected patients for clinical and laboratory signs of active HBV or HCV 
infection is recommended.  
Neutropenia  
Severe neutropenia [absolute neutrophil count (ANC) <0.5 x 103/uL] developed in up to 2.0% of renal, up to 2.8% of 
cardiac, and up to 3.6% of hepatic transplant patients receiving MMF 3g daily.  Patients receiving MMF should be 
monitored for neutropenia. The development of neutropenia may be related to CellCept itself, concomitant medications, viral infections, or some combination of these causes.  If neutropenia develops (ANC <1.3 x 10
3/uL), dosing 
with MMF should be interrupted or the dose reduced, appropriate diagnostic tests performed, and the patient managed appropriately.  Neutropenia has been observed most frequently in the period from 31 to 180 days post -transplant in 
patients treated for prevention of renal, cardiac, and hepatic rejection.  
Patients receivi ng MMF should be instructed to report immediately any evidence of infection, unexpected bruising, 
bleeding,  or any other manifestation of bone marrow depression.  
Pure Red Cell Aplasia (PRCA)  
Cases of pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) have been reported in pati ents treated with MMF in combination with other 
immunosuppressive agents.  The mechanism for MMF induced PRCA is unknown; the relative contribution of other immunosuppressants and their combinations in an immunosuppression regimen are also unknown.  In some cases, PRCA was found to be reversible with dose reduction or cessation of MMF therapy.  In transplant patients, however, 
reduced immunosuppression may place the graft at risk. 
Gastrointestinal Disorders 
Gastrointestinal bleeding (requiring hospitalization) has been observed in approximately 3% of renal, in 1.7% of cardiac, 
and in 5.4% of hepatic transplant patients treated with MMF 3 g daily.  In pediatric renal transplant patients, 5/148 cases 
of gastrointestinal bleeding (requiring hospitalization) were observed.  Gastrointestinal perforations have rarely been 
observed. Most patients receiving MMF were also receiving other drugs known to be associated with these complications.  Patients with active peptic ulcer disease were excluded from enrollment in s tudies with MMF.  Because 
MMF has been associated with an increased incidence of digestive system adverse events, including infrequent cases of gastrointestinal tract ulceration, hemorrhage, and perforation, MMF should be administered with caution in patie nts 
with active serious digestive system disease. 
Patients with Renal Impairment  
Subjects with severe chronic renal impairment (GFR <25 mL/min/1.73 m2) who have received single doses of MMF 
showed higher plasma MPA and MPAG AUCs relative to subjects with lesser degrees of renal impairment or normal 
healthy volunteers.  No data are available on the safety of long -term exposure to these levels of MPAG.  Doses of MMF 
greater than 1 g administered twice a day to renal transplant patients should be avoided and they should be carefully 
observed. 
Patients with HGPRT Deficiency  
MMF is an IMPDH (inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase) inhibitor; therefore, it should be avoided in patients with 
rare hereditary deficiency of hypoxanthine -guanine phosphoribosyl -transferase (HGPRT) such as Lesch- Nyhan and 
Kelley-Seegmiller syndrome.

Therefore, care should be taken if MMF Oral Suspension is administered  to patients with phenylketonuria.  
 Risks of Study  Procedures   
 Risks of Blood Draws  
Risks of blood draw or venipuncture are typically minimal with temporary local discomfort. More serious risks would 
include ecchymosis and, rarely, localized infection. The amount of blood that may be drawn from adult subjects for research purposes will not be more than 600 mL over an eight-week period. The additional amount of blood could 
contribute to the development of anemia. The subject’s clinical condition will be taken  into consideration to determine 
if research blood tests can be performed.  
 Risks of Leukapheresis  
The common risks of leukapheresis include bruising and discomfort at the site of needle placement, typically in the 
antecubital fossae.   Calcium level in blood may fall due the citrate anticoagulant  used to prevent clotting in the 
leukapheresis instrument.   Hypocalcemia can lead to perior al or digital numbness and tingling.  Calcium replacement 
may be used during the procedure and is routinely used at the conclusion of the procedure.   Platelet count may fall due 
to platelet loss during processing.   Hemorrhagic complications due to thromboc ytopenia have not been reported in 
normal donors.  Thrombosis and bleeding could theoretically occur , although they are rarely if ever observed.  
 Risks of Kidney Biopsy  
There is a risk of bleeding associated with transplant kidney biopsies. Transient hemat uria occurs in 3 to 10% of patients 
and may prolong hospitalization, require bladder catheterization for clot drainage, or in approximately 1% of patients, 
require blood transfusion. Ureteral obstruction from blood clot may require percutaneous nephrostomy  in <1% of 
patients. Massive hemorrhage requiring surgical exploration, transplant nephrectomy, or arterial embolization occurs in 
~0.1 % of patients. Death from massive hemorrhage is rare. 
 Potential  Benefits  
This study might not provide direct or immediate benefit to the participants.   
 Decrease  in Graft  Inflammation  
It is possible that infusions of Tregs may modify the infiltrate in the renal allograft to the benefit of the kidney  (Taflin C, 
2010) . 
 CNI Reduction 
Subjects who have a significant decrease in graft inflammation will be eligible for reduction and potentially elimination of tacrolimus therapy. This may help to reduce/ prevent adverse effects associated with CNI therapy, including 
nephrotoxicity  (Mjörnstedt L, 2012) .

  Study Visits  
 Enrollment  
The research study will be explained in lay terms to each potential research participant. The potential participant will 
sign an informed consent form before undergoing any study procedures . A subject is considered enrolled in the trial 
once the consent fo rm has been signed.   
 Study Eligibility and Study Group Allocation  
Subjects will have a renal allograft biopsy performed 5 months (±8 weeks) after transplantation.  Biopsy results will be 
an integral part of s creen ing for study eligibility  and will be conf irmed by the central pathologist prior to enrollment.  
During the screening period the study personnel will review the subject’s medical record for previous and current 
medical history , demographic information (age, gender, and race), medications, and laboratory test results.  Additional 
laboratory tests, such as a pregnancy test (if applicable), will be performed at the transplant center for screening 
purposes.  Blood, urine a nd tissue will be collected for central laboratory analysis . 
Eligible patients wi ll be assigned according to the allocation scheme (Section 3.7)  to 2 groups:  group 1 CNI maintenance; 
group 2 infusion of 550 ± 450 x 106 polyTregs.   The day of study group assignment is designated day 0 on the Schedule 
of Events (Appendix 2 and 3).   
 Specific Visits for Group 2  
 Whole Blood  Collection or Leukapheresis for Treg Manufacture (PBMC Collection  Visit)  
Participants in Group 2 will provide 4 50-500 ml of whole blood via phlebotomy or have leukapheresis; either will be 
shipped to UCSF for manufacturing.  The actual visit dates of recipient collections will be based on the selected infusion 
date.  
 Treg  Infusion  Visit 
Eligibility for Treg infusion w ill be reviewed at the time of the study visit.  When applicable, a  urine pregnancy test must 
be confirmed negative prior to infusion.  Blood will be drawn for local laboratory tests.  Subjects will receive the polyTreg infusion no later than 62 days  after central biopsy confirmation.   The Treg infusion visit requires an  overnight 
stay in the hospital or research unit for observation. 
 Follow Up Visits  
Group 2 participants will have study visits on day 1, 7, 14, 28, 84, 182, and 36 4 after Treg infusi on.  Participants in Group 
1 will have the same visits in parallel with Group 2 patients, starting 48 days after study group assignment .  Please refer 
to Appendix 2 for Group 1 schedule of events and Appendix 3  for Group 2  schedule of events. 
10.4.1 Provisions fo r COVID -19 
Participating centers should follow site- specific guidance related to COVID -19 in regard to telemedicine visits in leiu of

  Mechanistic  Assays 
The goal of the mechanistic studies in this trial is to evaluate the impact of polyTregs  on the immunological profiles of 
kidney transplant recipients.  We will accomplish this by determining: 1) impact of Treg infusion on the numbers of 
circulating and gr aft-infiltrating Tregs; 2) impact of Treg infusion on the inflammation in the graft; 3) impact of Treg 
infusion on the peripheral blood biomarkers of rejection and graft injury.  
 Impact of Treg Infusion on Numbers  of Circulating and Graft- Infiltrating Tregs  
 Detection of Infused  Tregs  Using Deuterium Labeling (Deu -bl) 
Infused polyTregs will be indistinguishable from endogenous Tregs by standard surface markers, prohibiting the tracking of infused cells using conventional means. The Hellerstein group and other s have developed stable -isotope -labeling 
technology to measure the survival, replication, and trafficking of murine and human cells. Importantly, deuterium, a naturally occurring stable isotope of hydrogen, is nonradioactive and non -toxic, and has been saf ely used as a cellular, 
molecular, and metabolic marker in patients and healthy controls for more than 6 decades  (Busch R, 2007)  (Macallan 
DC, 1998) . The use of deuterium-labeled glucose in polyTreg cultures led to ~60% labeling of DNA that was detectable 
using gas chromatography -mass spectrometry (GC -MS). Deuterium labeling is permanent such that the percentage of 
deuterated DNA on a per cell basis only decreases with DNA replication. After intraven ous administration of 3.2 x 10
8 
deuterium-labeled polyTregs  in the UCSF type I diabetes trial, infused Tregs were readily detected up to 180 days post 
infusion in all 3 patients, demonstrating the feasibility of this approach  (Figure 4).  In addition, early experience with a 
kidney transplant recipient shows that Tregs from immunosuppressed patients can be labeled with similar efficiency 
during in vitro expansion and the in vivo pharmacokinetics of Tregs is similar to that seen type 1 dia betes patients who 
were not on immunosuppression ( Figure 4 ).

TASK                                                Version 11.0 / January 11, 2022  Following infusion of stable isotope -labeled Tregs, 15 ml of whole blood will be collected at visits specified in the 
schedule of events (Appendix 2 and 3 ). The cells will be processed into PBMC and Tregs will be sorted based on 
CD4+CD127lo/-CD25+ markers. In addition, CD4+ T cells tha t are outside the Treg gate will also be collected and analyzed 
to determine if infused Tregs give rise to non-Tregs in vivo after infusion.  Genomic DNA will be isolated from the 
purified c ells and hydrolyz ed before assessing  the 2H isotopic enrichment of  the purine deoxyribonucleosides using  GC-
MS.  The level of  2H enrichment among the purified Treg and non -Treg cells will be determined. 
 Detection of Infused Tregs in Graft Using Deuterium Labeling (Deu -biopsy) 
Tregs have a propensity to traffic to and accumulate in sites of inflammation.  Since patients in this trial are selected to 
have inflammation in the kidney allograft, the infused Tregs may infiltrate the graft.  To determine if this occurs, fresh 
biopsy samples (1/2 to a full 16G core) will be collected 2 weeks after Treg infusion.  The tissue will be digested to dissoc iate 
the cells into single cell suspension.  Infiltrating CD45+immune cells and its various subsets will be isolated using FACS and 
the level of  2H enrichment among the purified cells will be determined as described above for blood samples.  
 Peripheral Blood Treg N umber (MFC -Treg) 
Blood (1 ml) will be collected at visits specified in the schedule of events ( Appendix 2 and 3 ), processed into PBMC, and 
cryopreserved for batched analysis.  Percentage of Tregs among CD4 T cells will be determined using multiparameter 
flow cytometry (MFC) as described in section 11.3.1  below.  The absolute number of peripheral blood Tregs will be 
calculated using the number of CD4 counts obtained from clinical lab test.  
 Treg TruCount Analysis  
Samples collected for this assay will be used directly for analysis without cryopreservation.  Blood will be aliquoted into a  
TruCount tube, stained with fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies to CD4, CD45, CD25 and CD127, and anal yzed on a 
flow cytometer to enumerate the numbers of Tregs.  
This assay would allow us to obtain the absolute Treg counts in one microliter of blood.   
 Impact of Treg I nfusion on Graft Inflammation  
 Detection of Intragraft Inflammation by Multiplexed Immunofluorescence and in situ  
Hybridization  (mIF/ISH)  
Histopathology combined with immunohistochemistry (IHC) or immunofluorescence (IF) provides information on the location, nature, and magnitude of the inflammatory response, but traditionally is not a reliable approach for 
quantifying changes in inflammatory mediators. To quantitatively assess cytokine expression in the graft tissue in response to intervention, the Laszik lab has adapted the RNAScope® in situ  hybridization (ISH) platform to  analyze 
formalin-fixed paraffin -embedded biopsies.  Furthermore, a novel technology that combines ISH with IF was developed 
and optimized for various targets; this highly sensitive and specific ISH/IF methodology combined with computer -
assisted image analysis allows precise quantitative phenotypical analysis of immune infiltrates and parenchymal cells 
along with their gene expression profiles in the biopsy  tissue. We plan to  use this technology to assess change in 
inflammatory and tolerance markers in the grafts after Treg therapy in biopsy samples obtained at 2 weeks and 6 months after Treg infusion and compared to the baseline in the eligibility biopsy samples . The following structural and 
inflammatory markers will be evaluated using IHC/IF technology: collagen 3 for interstitial fibrosis, and CD4, CD8, Treg 
(FoxP3), CD20, and CD68 for inflammation. ISH IL -6 mRNA will be detected via ISH.  Any for-cause biopsies performed 
during the study will also be evaluated using the same parameters.

 Graft Common Response Module (CRM) Gene Expression 
Increased transcriptional profiling of transplant biopsies has provided useful insights into allograft injury mechanisms 
such as acute and chronic rejection (Samanta A, 2008)  (Morgun A, 2006)  (Snyder TM, 2011) . Identifying a common 
rejection mechanism could facilitate novel diagnostics without requiring details about tissue -specific injury. Recently, 
the Sarwal Lab and collaborators analyzed whole genome expression profiles in 13 independent transplant cohorts consisting of 1164 graft biopsy samples from four different organs (kidney, heart, lung, and liver) and thus representing 
the largest study of its kind in transplantation. This study was able to define a CRM for the prediction of cross -organ 
acute rejection and identification of novel drug targets in transplantation  (Khatri P, 2013) . The CRM consists of 12 genes 
that were significantly u p regulated during rejection independent of the organ type ( Figure 5  and Table 3). Additional 
pathway analyses revealed the relevant association of these genes with T cell receptors, interleukins, chemokines and 
transcription factors. In order to avoid (1) the influence of a single large experiment on the meta -anal ysis results and (2) 
organ-specific bias due to unequal number of data sets (and samples) used in the metaanalysis, a “leave-one-organ  out” 
meta -analysis was performed leading to the definition of 12 ubiquitously overexpressed rejection associated genes 
BASP1, CD6, CD7, CXCL10, CXCL9, INPP5D, ISG20, LCK, NKG7, PSMB9, RUNX3, and TAP1.

Table 3. CRM : Upregulated genes during rejection  
The significance of the CRM genes in AR was validated in an independent cohort of publicly available microarray data 
from 282 renal allograft biopsies (GSE 36059;  (Halloran PF, 2010) ) and classified AR (irrespective of cellular, antibody or 
mixed rejection calls) and stable samples with high accuracy ( Figure 7A). Most importantly, the CRM expression 
correlated with molecular inflammation and the extent of graft injury when formulated into a statistically derived CRM -
Score using 11/12 defined genes, calculated by using the geometric mean of the expression of each of the CRM genes in 
each sample. In AR biopsies, the CRM quantitative score correlated with the Banff t -score (p = 6.04e -12) and the Banff i -
score (p=2.72e-12) supporting the value of this molecular measurement in the assessment of alloimmune inflammation  
in the graft. The CRM score in histologically normal 6-month  protocol biopsies also correlated strongly with the Banff ct 
score (p -value = 1.995e -5) and Banff ci score (p -value = 6.195e -7) in transplants that went on to develop progressive 
chronic allograft injury, versus those that had stable histology and graft function (p=4.9e-6, Figure 7B ). Given that 
histological analysis of the graft can miss subtle changes in inflammation, the inclusion of the CRM score as a surrogate for SCI is a strength of this s tudy  in the interpretation of the inflammation response in the kidney and retrospective 
interrogation for its interplay with other peripheral markers of graft inflammation in the blood and the urine.  The 
finding that the CRM score associates with the exte nt of graft injury (Figure 7B) as assessed by Banff criteria is of special 
importance for the current study , as it provides a measure of integrating gene expression profiles with the findings of 
the immune histopathology core. Moreover , as the CRM score al so correlates with an increased risk of subsequent graft 
fibrosis, it may inform investigators of those at risk for late graft failure and provide mechanistic insight into the success 
of the proposed interventions.

TASK                                                Version 11.0 / January 11, 2022  Total RNA will be extracted from 3x10¥ìm -thick sections of the FFPE tissue using the PureLink FFPE Total RNA Isolation 
Kit. RNA quantity and integrity will be determined with the Thermo Scientific NanoDrop ND -2000 UV-Vis 
Spectrophotometer a nd Agilent Bioanalyzer, respectively.  Gene expression will be analyzed using a set of 800 immune 
genes that includes the CRM genes. The RNA samples will be added to a Barcoded Codeset designed by NanoString 
Technologies consisting of Reporter and Capture probes that hybridize to the target sequences of interest, forming a 
tripartite complex.  The raw counts for each assay will be collected using the NanoString data analysis software, nSolver¢ç (NanoString Technologies, Seattle, WA). Normalization of the data will be performed using nSolver¢ç for the 
following two methods. (1) Positive control normalization: gene expression data is normalized to the mean of the POS 
control probes for each assay. (2) RNA content normalization: gene expression data is normaliz ed to the geometric mean 
of housekeeping genes in the CodeSet.  
The CRM score is defined as geometric mean of the CRM genes expression.  Distribution of CRM scores in AR and STA 
groups and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve are shown for GSE21374 (Figure 8A-B), GSE36059 (Figure 8C -D). 
The x axes represent false positive rate, and the y axes represents true positive rate when using the CRM scores for 
predicting AR. Error bars indicate the standard error of the mean (Fig.8). In each independent data set, the CRM score 
was significantly higher in the AR group (P < 1.5 ¡¿ 10£¬7; Fig. 8). Each unit increment in the CRM score increased the 
odds of AR by 4.17 and 5.45 in GSE21374 and GSE36059. It was also able to distinguish AR and STA samples with high 
specificity and sensitivity in GSE21374 area under the curve (AUC = 0.83; Fig. 8B), GSE36059 (AUC = 0.8; Fig. 8D). The 
quantitative CRM score will be used to quantify SCI at a molecular level in the 2 week and 7 -month protocol biopsies as 
well as any clinica lly indicated biopsies in the TASK study. The rest of the ~780 immune genes will also be analyzed along 
with the CRM genes. The gene expression data will be correlated with the Banff scores and the inflammatory cell load in 
the biopsies as measured by quan titative image analysis of CD45-stained sections of the FFPE tissue.

 Urinary Biomarkers of Graft In flammation and Injury  
Urine protein biomarkers correlate highly with the graft milieu and may directly reflect alloreactive inflammation and 
injury  (Lei J, 2010)  (Ling XB, 2010)  (Schaub S, 2004)  (Schaub S W. J., 2006)  (Sigdel TK K. A., 2010) . The Sarwal lab has 
utilized a cohort of over 2000 highly clinically annotated urine samples from ~800 p rospectively monitored renal 
transplant recipients, collected in multiple clinical trials (CCTPT SNSO1 study, U01 AI55795 -02; CTOTC IMPACT trial 1U01 
AI077821; AARA UO1AI063594-06). By following an unbiased high- throughput 2D -LCMS/MS based proteomic approa ch, 
the Sarwal Lab selected 11 urine proteins (fibrinogen β (FBB), fibrinogen γ (FBG), Class II histocompatibility protein, HLA -
DRB1 and SUMO2) to develop a composite biomarker panel for transplant injury, distinguishing acute rejection, chronic rejection and BKVN (p<0.01; fold increase >1.5). This panel has been validated in 154 independent urine samples, each 
with biopsy matched phenotypic diagnoses. Interestingly, when histological scores of inflammation from the biopsies matched with the urine sample co llections were analyzed, there was a significant correlation (r=0.73; p<0.0003) 
between these urinary proteins and mononuclear cell interstitial inflammation score (i-score) and the tubulitis score (t -
score), suggesting that these urine proteins in additio n to being valuable clinical biomarkers for rejection monitoring, 
may also segregate biopsies with higher grades of T cell mediated rejection.  In addition, mRNA analysis for the CRM genes in urine may also provide a means to monitor for SCI in a non -invasive, serial manner.  
Total RNA will be extracted from the urine pellet (Qiagen). Total RNA will be measured for RNA integrity using the RNA 6000 Nano LabChip Kit on a 2100 Bioanalyzer (both from Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA), with suitable RNA defined by an RNA integrity number exceeding 5. Using a urine sample processing method that we developed, urinary 
proteins will be isolated by filtering the supernatant through Amicon Ultra centrifugal filtration tubes (10K molecular 
weight cutoff, Millipore, Bedford, MA) to separate small MW peptides and other pigments (<10 kDa) from the larger proteins. Commercially available ELISA assays for the urine protein panels will be purchased from Antibodies -online 
(Atlanta, GA), and the urine protein levels will be normalized to urine creatinine levels. The relative amount of mRNA expression in each sample will be calculated for each of the CRM genes using the comparative threshold cycle (CT) method. Expression values for all genes will be normalized to ribosomal18S RNA (18S). The levels of specific proteins and

fibrosis.  
 Impact of Treg I nfusion on Peripheral Blood Biomarkers of Rejection and G raft Injury  
 Peripheral Blood Leukocyte  Population and Phenotype by Multiparameter Flow Cytometry 
(MFC) 
Blood (1 ml) will be collected at visits specified in the schedule of events ( Appendix 2 and 3 ), processed into PBMC, and 
cryopreserved for batched analysis to assess impact of Treg infusion on the frequencies and phenotypes of peripheral blood leukocytes.  The MFC analysis is focused on defining leukocyte subsets, T cell activation/exhaustion status, and CD4+ and CD8+ Treg frequencies.  Extensively validated MFC panels will be us ed to quantify changes in leukocyte 
populations in blood ( Table 4) collected prior to and after Treg infusion.  The absolute number of each cell types in the 
peripheral blood will be calculated by referencing to the number of CD4 counts obtained from clinical lab test.

 Peripheral Blood Biomarkers of Acute Rejection (kSORT)  
Building  on a recent publication of the identification of 10 genes in peripheral blood for the diagnosis of pediatric renal 
allograft rejection in low -risk patients (Rose -John, 2012) , an additional 7 genes for the diagnosis and prediction of acute 
rejection in both pediatric and adult kidney transplant recipients  (Roedder S S. T., 2014)  was identified, independent of 
the cause of end stage renal disease, co -morbidities, transplant center or immunosuppression usage. This signature 
comprises the following genes (CFLAR, DUSP1, ITGAX, RNF130, PSEN1, NKTR, RYBP, NAMPT, MAPK9, IFNGR1, CEACAM4, 
RHEB, GXMK, RARA, SLC25A37, EPOR, RXRA) which combines the previous 10 -gene set in addition to 7 genes obtained 
through additional inclusion of adult renal transplant data, into the final developed assay that will be used in this study 
called k SORT ( kidney solid organ response test)  (Table 5). 
The kSORT genes are highly specific and sensitive for the prediction of biopsy confirmed acute rejection at the time of 
AR, and additionally 3 -4 months prior to graft dysfunction and histologically confirmed AR. The 17 genes can be easily 
used for the prediction of acute rejection using a novel plug-in reference -correlation classification approach called 
Lineage Profiler; this program has been customized in the Sarwal Lab and calculates an AR risk score where a score >0 
indicates AR and a score <0 indicates non-AR ( Figure 8 ). The SORT genes will be analyzed in our trials to define their 
association with inflammation and borderline rejection and to examine whether they are relevant in the response to 
therapy with Tregs.

Figure 8 .  Performance of the kSORT assay. (A) kSORT score and classification category were calculated for each sample: the kSORT 
assay correctly classified 36 out of 39 AR samples as high risk for AR (red bars, 92.3%; risk score ≥9) and 43 out of 46 No- AR samples 
as low risk for AR (green bars, 93.5%, risk score ≤9) across four different sample collection sites (UPMC, Mexico, Barcel ona and UCSF), 
and adult  versus pediatric recipient age groups, with samples collected in clinical trial and non- clinical -trial settings; remaining 15 
samples classified as indeterminate risk for AR (grey bars; risk score (scores <9 and > -9) (B) Mean aggr egated kSORT scores (error 
bars give standard error of mean) were significantly higher in all true AR samples than in all true No -AR samples by two -sided

No-AR, with the greatest correlation to the evaluated sample. Classification of a sample as AR, No -AR, or indeterminate 
will be derived by computing the Pearson correlation coefficients for all sample –centroid comparisons, assigning a score 
of 1 to samples with a greater correlation to an AR centroid and a score of -1 to samples with a greater correlation to a 
No-AR centroid. A kSAS aggregated AR risk score ( -13 to 13) will then be determined by summing the scores for all 
evaluated gene models. Indeterminate samples will be defined as those with a score less than 9 and greater than -9, based on evaluation of sample classification. The blood sample kSORT scores will be correlated with SCI and clinical AR 
(expected kSORT scores of ≥9) as well as stable, quiescent samples (expected kSORT scores of ≥ -9) in the TASK study .  
 Alloimune Quiescence  and Operational Tolerance  (kSPOT)  
Sarwal Lab has identified an initial tolerance footprint of 49 genes by microarray and qPCR in peripheral blood samples from 75 renal allograft recipients and 16 healthy individuals from the U.S. and in Europe (Brouard S, 2007). 21/49 genes 
correctly segregated tolerance and chronic rejection phenotypes with 99% and 86% specificity, and the signature was shared with 8% and 50% respectively of stable patients on triple i mmunosuppression and low -dose steroid monotherapy 
respectively . The gene signature suggested a pattern of reduced co -stimulatory signaling, immune quiescence, 
apoptosis, and memory T cell responses, and additionally suggested that TGFβ might contribute to this process. This 
panel has been reduced to a minimal 3 -gene signature (BNC2, CYP1B1, KLF6) called SPOT (Spontaneous Tolerance Test) 
using penalized logistic regression modeling. The inclusion of SPOT in the proposed trials will therefore provide an 
assessment of immune quiescence that may then be deployed as a measure for the success of Treg therapy. 
Additionally, these results provide a proof of concept for successfully linking the gene expression profiles in peripheral 
blood with the peripheral blood phenotype measured by flow cytometry.  
Sample collection and analysis plan for kSPOT. Please refer to kSORT for all sample collection and processing. The 21 
gene logistic regression score for a tolerance like signature (Roedder S, 2014) will determine immune quiescence profile 
for all samples in the TASK study and will evaluate if this signature is more likely to be found in patients who have received Treg therapy.  
 Non-HLA  Antibody Assays for Prediction of Chronic Allograft Injury  (nHLA -Ab)  
The Sarwal Lab has identified and validated a de novo panel of 6 nHLA- Ab (MIG, ITAC, IFN -γ, GABPA, IL8, CCL21, GDNF) 
at 6 months post-transplant as important and previously unrecognized triggers of subsequent chronic graft injury (Sigdel 
TK, 2012) . This panel positively correlated (r=0.78; p<0.01) with the chronic allograft damage index (Yilmaz S, 2003)  
scores at 2 years with 80% sensitivity and 100% specificity. This discovery involved th e use of high -throughput screening 
of serum IgG interactions in post-transplant recipient sera to 9000 unique full -length human proteins using the 
Protoarray (Invitrogen) protein array technology and data analysis by customized algorithms  (Li L, 2009) . The Sarwal Lab 
has generated customized reverse ELISA assays for this panel of nHLA -Ab to be easily multiplexed on the Meso Scale 
Discovery® (MSD) platform. These specific nHLA-Ab panels will be correlated with histological chronicity and change in eGFR in the different treatment arms of the study.  
Sample processing analysis plan for nHLA MSD ELISA will be carried out following the protocol developed in the Sarwal 
lab. Briefly 15 ng antigen will be coated on to the wells using 50 µ L coating at 0.3 µg/ml. The plates will be stored at 4 °C 
overnight. The following day the coating solution is removed and the plate is blocked by 150 µl Blocker A (at RT, 450 rmp) for 1 hr.  After 1 hr the plate will be washed 3 times with 300 µl wash buffer. Next, 25 µl of diluted samples will be added and incubated at RT with 450 rpm for 2 hr. This will be followed by washing step followed by addition of 25 µl 
detection antibody SULFO -TAG Goat anti Human (Meso Scale Discovery, Gaithersburg MD, Cat# R32AJ -5) (1:1000 
dilution) for 1 hr. After this step the plates will be washed and 150ul/well of 1X read buffer (MSD Gaithersburg MD, Cat#

signal intensity will be used to measure relative abundance of the nHLA antibodies in the samples. The data will be 
analyzed by Mann -Whitney test using GraphPad Prism software. Spearman correlation will be done to correlate nHLA Ab 
signal with histological chronicity and change in eGFR in the different treatment arms of the study. These specific nHLA -
Ab panels will be correlated with histological chronicity and change in eGFR in the different treatment arms of the study.  
 Markers of Tubular Epithelial Injury and Renal  Fibrosis 
Urine and serum markers of renal injury have been associated with subsequent graft fibrosis and failure. Preliminary 
studies in Dr. Mannon’s laboratory have identified urinary TGFβ, connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) and the integrin 
ligand vitronectin as associated with allograft injury and fibrosis (Cheng O, 2008)  (Mannon RB, 2010) . In addition, urinary 
ANXA11, α3 and β3 integrins and TNF -α have been found to be closely associated with acute alloimmune mediated 
injury in kidney transplant recipients  (Srivastava M, 2011) but have not yet been analyzed prospectively.   A novel link 
under study is between innate immune activation and allograft fibrosis, and measures of HMGB1 and HSP 27 in serum 
and urine will be of value (Harris HE, 2012)  (Lotze M, 2005) .  The recent association of resistin with brain death and 
delayed graft function  (Oltean S, 2013) , as well as the association of acute inflammation, endothelial activation and 
fibrosis (Jackson AM, 2014)  suggest this as a protein that can be measured in this prospective cohort.   Having such 
targets is critical while investigating therapies which may mitigate inflammatory injury that leads to subsequent graft failure in order to monitor the success or failure of treatment. Other relevant targets for monitoring include expression of matrix molecules such as collagens I and III (Mannon R, 1999) and fibroblast infiltration such as α -SMA as indicators of 
developing fibrosis (Cheng O, 2008)  as well as recently described markers of myeloid fibroblast infiltration including 
MCP-1, CXCL16 and adiponectin (Yang J, 2013) . Establishing a link between these markers and graft histology/ renal 
function is a unique feature of this proposal in which protocol biopsies provide a “hard endpoint” in the subjects’ 
management.  
 Stored Plasma and Serum  
Plasma and serum will be collected on the day of planned infusion, prior to polyTreg administration for subjects in Group 2 .  If a need arises during the course of the study, testing may be performed on archived specimens (e.g. CMV, BK, DSA 
etc.).

  Biospecimen Storage 
Biological specimens ( i.e., whole blood, plasma, serum, urine supernatant, urine pellet) obtained under this protocol 
may be used in future assays to reevaluate biological responses as additional research tests are developed over time. 
Residual  specimens collected at time points planned for the core mechanistic studies  will be maintained to allow 
specimens to be stored for  possible use in new assays that have yet to be optimized or conceived, or assays performed 
by other CTOT members  for cross -validation studies.  Appropriate informed consent will be obtained for both the 
collection and storing of samples.  During the funding period, samples will be identifiable, which means samples will be 
coded with a subject ID number that could be directly linked to the subject and the subject’s medical record.  The 
specimens from these eva luations may be stored beyond the funding period. Samples will be identifiable, which means 
samples will be coded with a subject ID number that could be directly linked to the subject and the subject’s medical record.  When the funding period is over, data  from the clinical database will be de-identified, meaning patient 
identifiers will be removed , and all associated date information will be transformed to study days.  Core laboratories 
and/or repositories maintaining specimens will not have the ability to  identify a subject or access data associated with a 
specimen without specific approval from the study team.

  Safety  Monitoring  and Reporting  
 Overview  
This section defines the types of safety data that will be collected under this protocol and outlines the procedures for 
appropriately collecting, grading, recording, and reporting those data. Adverse events that are classified as serious 
according to the definition of health authorities must be r eported promptly to the sponsor [ DAIT/NIAID ].  Appropriate 
notifications will also be made to site principal investigators, Institutional Review Boards (IRBs),  and health authorities.  
Information in this section complies with ICH Guideline E2A: Clinical Safety Data Management: Definitions and Standards 
for Expedited Reporting, ICH Guideline E -6: Guideline for Good Clinical Practice, 21CFR Parts 312 and 320, and applies 
the standards set forth in the National Cancer Institute (NCI), Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), 
Version 4.0:  http://ctep.cancer.gov/reporting/ctc.html . 
 Definitions  
 Adverse Event  (AE)  
Any untoward or unfavorable medical occurrence associated with the subject’s participation in the research, whether or 
not considered related to the subject’s participation in the research (modified from the definition of adverse events in 
the 1996 International Conference on Harmonization E-6 Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice) (f rom OHRP "Guidance 
on Reviewing and Reporting Unanticipated Problems Involving Risks to Subjects or Other s and Adverse Events 
(1/15/07)"  http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/policy/advevntguid.html#Q2  )  
 Suspected  Adverse Reaction (SAR)  
Any adverse event for which there is a reasonable possibility that the investigational drug [or investigational study therapy regimen] caused the adverse event. For the purposes of safety reporting, ‘reasonable possibility’ means there is 
evidence to suggest  a causal relationship between the drug and the adverse event. A suspected adverse reaction implies 
a lesser degree of certainty about causality than adverse reaction, which means any adverse event caused by a drug (21 
CFR 312.32(a)).  
 Unexpected  Adverse  Event  
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered  “unexpected” if it is not listed in the I nvestigator  Brochure 
or package inser t or is not listed at the specificity, severity or rate of occurrence tha t has been observed . 
“Unexpected” also refers to adverse events or suspected adverse react ions that are mentioned in the Investigator 
Brochure or package insert as occurring with a class of drugs or as anticipated from the pharmacological properties of 
the drug, but are not sp ecifically mentioned as occurring with the particular drug under investigation (21 CFR 312.32(a) ] 
 Serious  Adverse Event  (SAE)  
An adverse event  or suspected adverse reaction is considered “serious” if, in the view of either the investigator or 
Sponsor , it results in any of the following outcomes (21 CFR 312.32(a)): 
1. Death.  
2. A life -threatening event: An AE or SAR is considered “life-threatening” if, in the view of either the 
investigator or Sponsor [add DAIT/NIAID or other Sponsor, if applicable] , its occurrence places the 
subject at immediate risk of death. It does not include an AE or SAR that, had it occurred in a more 
severe form, might have caused death.  
3. Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization.  
CTOT-21  Confidential  Page 64 of 65  
TASK                                                Version 11.0 / January 11, 2022  4. Persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life 
functions.  
5. Congenital anomaly or birth defect.  
6. Important medical events that may not result in death, be life threatening, or require hospitalization may be considered serious when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.  
Elective hospitalizations or hospital admissions for the purpose of conduct of protocol mandated procedures are not to 
be reported as an SAE unless hospitalization is prolonged due to complications.  
 Other Significant Adverse Events  
The events below should be reported (entered on the AE/SAE form) within 24 hours of awareness even if th e event does 
not meet serious criteria:  
• Biopsy proven or clinical (Treated) AR  
• Chronic rejection 
• Infusion Reactions (CTCAE grade 2 or higher)  
• Malignancy, PTLD  
• Infections (study defined grade 3 or higher)  
• COVID -19 infections of any grade  
If no other serious criteria are met for COVID -19 infection, the event should be considered of medical importance.  
 Grading and Attribution of Adverse Events  
 Grading  Criteria  
The study site will grade the severity of adverse events experienced by the study subjects according to the criteria set forth in the National Cancer Institute’s Common Terminology  Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE)  version 4.0 .    
This document (referred  to herein as the NCI -CTCAE manual) provides a common language to describe levels of severity, 
to analyze and interpret data, and to articulate the clinical significance of all adverse events. The NCI -CTCAE has been 
reviewed by the  principal  investigator a nd protocol chair  and has been deemed appropriate for the subject population 
to be studied in this protocol.  
Infections will be graded using the study -specific scale as described below:  
Grade 1 = asymptomatic; clinical or diagnostic observation only; intervention with oral antibiotic, antifungal, or 
antiviral agent  only; no invasive intervention required 
Grade 2 = symptomatic; intervention with intravenous antibiotic, antifungal, or antiviral agent; invasive intervention may be required  
Grade 3 = any infection associated with hemodynamic compromise requiring pressors; any infection necessitating 
ICU level of care; any infection necessitating operative intervention; any infection involving the central nervous 
system; any infection with a positive fungal blo od culture; any proven or probable aspergillus infection; any tissue 
invasive fungal infection; any pneumocystis jiroveci infection  
Grade 4 = life -threatening infection

TASK                                                Version 11.0 / January 11, 2022  All other a dverse events will be graded on a s cale from 1 to 5 according to the follo wing standards in the NCI-CTCAE 
manual:  
Grade 1 = mild adverse event.  
Grade 2 = moderate adverse event.  
Grade 3 = severe and undesirable adverse event.  
Grade 4 = life -threatening or disabling adverse event.  
Grade 5 = death.  
Infection events grade 2 or higher; and all other events CTCAE grade 2 or higher will be recorded on  the appropriate AE 
eCRF  for this study.  
For grading an abnormal value or result of  a clinical or laboratory evaluation (including, but not limited to, a radiograph, 
an ultrasound, an electrocardiogram etc.), a treatment-emergent adverse event is defined as an increase in grade from 
baseline or from the last post -baseline value that does n’t meet grading criteria. Changes in grade from screening to 
baseline will also be recorded as adverse events but  are not treatment -emergent. If a specific event or result from a 
given clinical or laboratory evaluation is not included in the NCI -CTCAE man ual, then an abnormal result would be 
considered an adverse event if changes in therapy or monitoring are implemented  as a result of the event/result . 
 Attribution Definitions  
The relationship, or attribution, of an adverse event to the study therapy regimen or study procedure(s) will initially be 
determined by the site investigator and recorded on the appropriate AE /SAE eCRF.  Final determination of attribution 
for safety reporting will be determined by DAIT/NIAID .  The relationship of an adverse event to s tudy therapy regimen or 
procedures will be determined using the descriptors and definitions provided in Table 6.

 Collection and Recording of Adverse Events  
 Collection  Period  
Adverse events will be collected from the time of first study mandated procedure until a subject  completes study 
participation or until 30 days after he/she prematurely withdraws (without withdrawing consent) or is withdrawn from 
the study.  
Note that the study eligibility is performed as a standard of care surveillance biopsy with no collection of research 
specimens.  The eligibility biopsy is not considered a study mandated procedure for these re asons.  
 Collecting  Adverse Events  
Adverse events (including SAEs) may be discovered through any of these methods:  
• Observing the subject.  
• Interviewing the subject [e.g., using a checklist, structured questioning, diary, etc.]  . 
• Receiving an unsolicited complaint from the subject. 
• In addition, an abnormal value or result from a clinical or laboratory evaluation can also indicate an 
adverse  event, as defined in Section 14.2.4, Grading and Attribution of  Adverse Events.  
 Recording  Adverse Events  
Throughout the study, the investigator will record adverse events and serious adverse events as described previously (Section 14.2 , Definitions) on the appropriate AE/SAE eCRF  regardless of the relationship to study therapy regimen or 
study procedure.   
Once recorded, an AE/SAE will be fol lowed until it resolves with or without sequelae, or until the end of study 
participation, or until 30 days after the subject prematurely withdraws (without withdrawing consent)/or is withdrawn 
from the study, whichever occurs first.  
 Reporting  of Serious  Adverse Events  and Adverse Events  
 Reporting  of Seri ous Adverse Events to Sponsor  
This section describes the responsibilities of the site investigator to report serious adverse events to the sponsor via  the 
AE/SAE eCRF.   Timely reporting of adverse events is required by 21 CFR and ICH E6 guidelines.  
Site investigators will report all serious adverse events  (see Section 14.2.3, Serious Adverse Event) , regardless of 
relationship or expectedness within 24 hours of discovering the event.

details of the event will not delay submission of the kn own information.  As additional details become available, the 
AE/SAE eCRF  will be updated and submitted.  
14.5.2. Reporting  to Health  Authority  
After an adverse event requiring 24- hour  reporting (per Section 14.5.1, Reportin g of Serious Adverse Events to S ponsor ) 
is submitted by the site investigator and assessed by DAIT/NIAID , there are two options  to report the adverse event  to 
the appropriate health authorities: 
14.5.2.1    Annual Reporting  
DAIT/NIAID  will include in the annual study report to health authorities all adverse events classified as: 
• Serious, expected, suspected a dverse reactions (see Section 14.2.1.1, Suspected Adverse Reaction, and Section 
14.2.2, Unexpected Adverse Event).  
• Serious and not a suspected adverse reaction (see Section 14.2.1.1, Suspected Adverse Reaction ). 
• Pregnancies.  
Note that all adverse events (not just those requiring 24-hour reporting) will be reported in the Annual IND Report.  
14.5.2.2  Expedited Safety  Reporting  
DAIT/NIAID shall notify the FDA and all participating investigators of expedited Safety Reports  within 15 calendar days; 
unexpected fatal or immediately life-threatening suspected adverse reaction(s) shall be reported as soon as possible or 
within 7 calendar days.  
This option, with 2 possible categories, applies if the adverse event is classified as one of the following:  
Category 1 :  Serious and unexpected suspected adverse reaction  [SUSAR]  (see Section 14.2.1.1, Suspected Adverse 
Reaction and Section 14.2.2, Unexpected Adverse Event  and 21 CFR 312.32(c)(1)i).  
The sponsor shall  report any suspected adverse reaction that is both serious and unexpected.  The spons or shall  report 
an adverse event as a suspected adverse reaction only if there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the study drug and the adverse event, such as:  
1. A single occurrence of an event that is uncommon and known to be strongly associated with drug 
exposure (e.g., angioedema, hepatic injury, or Stevens -Johnson Syndrome);  
2. One or more occu rrences of an event that is not commonly associated with drug exposure, but is 
otherwise uncommon in the population exposed to the drug (e.g., tendon rupture);  
3. An aggregate analysis of specific events observed in a clinical trial (such as known consequences of the underlying disease or condition under investigation or other events that commonly occur in the study population independent of drug therapy ) that indicates those events occ ur more frequently in the 
drug treatment group than in a concurrent or historical control group.  
 
Category 2: Any findings from studies that suggests a significant human risk  
The sponsor shall  report any findings from other epidemiological studies, analyses of adverse events within the current 
study or pooled analysis across clinical studies or animal or in vitro  testing (e.g.,  mutagenicity, teratogenicity, 
carcinogenicity) that suggest a significant risk in humans  exposed to th e drug that would result in a safety -related 
change in the protocol, informed consent, investigato r brochure or package insert or  other a spects of the overall 
conduct of the study.

 Reporting  of Adverse  Events to IRBs/IECs  
All investigators shall report adverse events, including expedited reports, in a timely fashion to their respective IRBs/IECs 
in accordance with applicable regulations and guidelines. All Safety Reports to the FDA  shall  be distributed by  
DAIT/NIAID  or desi gnee to all participating institutions for site IRB/IEC submission.  
 Pregnancy  Reporting  
The investigator shall be informed immediately of any pregnancy in a study subject or a partner of a study subject.  A 
pregnant subject shall  not receive Tregs, and will be instructed to  stop taking  everolimus, if applicable.  The investigator 
shall  counsel  the subject and discuss the risks of continuing with the pregnancy and the possible effects on  the fetus.  
Monitoring of the pregnant subje ct shall  continue until the conclusion of the  pregnancy.    
The investigator shall report to the Statistical and Clinical Coordinating Ce nter (SACCC)  all pregnancies within 1 business 
day of becoming aware of  the event using the Pregnancy eCRF .  All pregnancies identified during the study shall  be 
followed to conclusion and the outcome of each must be reported.  The Pregnancy eCRF  shall  be updated and submitted 
to the DAIT/NIAID via the SACCC when details about the outcome ar e available.  When possible, similar information shall  
be obtained for a  pregnancy occurring in a partner of a study subject.  
Information requested about the delivery shall  include: 
1. Gestational age at delivery  
2. Birth weight, length, and head circumference  
3. Gender 
4. Appearance, pulse, grimace, activity, and respiration (APGAR) score at 1 minute, 5 minutes, and 24 
hours after birth, if available  
5. Any abnormalities.  
All pregnancy  complications that result in a congenital abnormality , birth defect,  miscarriage, and medically  indicated 
abortion - an SAE shall  be submitted to the DAIT/NIAID via the SACCC using the SAE reporting procedures described 
above.  Pregnancies reported as SAE’s will be reported to the FDA as described above.  
 Reporting of Other Safety Information 
An investigator shall promptly notify the site IRB  as well as the SACCC using the AE/SAE eCRF when an “unanti cipated 
problem involving risks to subjects or others” is identified, which is not otherwise reportable as an adverse event.  
 Review of  Safety  Information 
 Medical  Monitor  Review  
The PI, Protocol Chair, and NIAID  Medic al Monitor will review safety data on an  ongoing basis.  Enrollment and initiation 
of study treatment may be suspended at any time if these reviews conclude that there are significant safety concerns.   
In addition, the Medical Monitor shall review and make decisions on the disposition of the SAE  and pregnancy reports 
received by the SACCC in a timely manner.

  Statistical  Considerations  and Analytical Plan  
 Overview   
CTOT-21 is a Phase 2 open label study, in which 14  adult kidney transplant recipients will be allocated to one of 2 
treatment arms: CNI-only, or polyTregs.  Subjects allocated to the Treg treatment arm will receive a single infusion of 
polyTregs approximately 7 months after transplant.  The primary safety objective is to evaluate the safety of polyTregs in 
adult kidney  transplant recipients.  The primary efficacy objective of the study is to evaluate whether polyTregs reduce 
graft inflammation when compared to CNI-based maintenance therapy.   
 Measures to Minimize  Bias   
The study groups will be assigned  in an un-blinded fashion using a variation of the Pocock and Simon adaptive 
randomization algorithm designed to maintain an overall 1:1 ratio.  Centralized laboratories will be used to minimize 
bias and mechanistic core laboratory personnel, including the core pathologist,  will be blinded to study treatment 
assignments.   Clinical sites will not be blinded to treatment assignments and reports for site use and monitoring 
purposes will not be blinded.  
 Analysis  Plan 
Statistical analyses of the safety and clinical outcomes will be performed  for the analysis sampl es defined below in 
section 15.3.1, employing standard methods for  the estimation of incidence rates and their exact two -sided 95% 
confidence intervals. Statistical analyses of most  mechanistic outcomes will be exploratory in nature. The subject 
enrolled and treated in the darTreg arm, prior to the removal of that treatment arm in protocol version 9.0, will be 
individually summarized, including but not limited to adverse events, infusion details, and inflammation scores and changes.  The plans for statistical analyses of study data will be described in more detail in a St atistical Analysis Plan 
(SAP).  
 Analysis Samples  
The statistical analyses will be performed on the following subject samples:  
1. The Modified Intent -to-Treat Sample 1 (mITT1) consists of a ll subjects allocated to the CNI -based 
treatment regimen or received polyTregs while on study.  
2. The Per Protocol Sample ( PP) consists of a ll subjects allocated to the CNI -based treatment regimen or 
received at least 300 x 106 of polyTregs while on study that did not have major protocol deviations of 
concern.  
3. The modified intent -to-Treat Sample 2 (mITT2) consists of a ll subjects who received polyTregs  (Group 2) .

15.3.2.2  Supportive Analyse s of the Primary Safety Endpoint s  
Although the study is not powered to detect clinically significant differences in safety event incidence between 
treatment groups , in a supportive analysis, the incidence of the composite endpoint will be compared between the two  
treatment groups by an overall Fisher’s exact test using the mITT1 analysis sample to compare the incidence between the two groups.

The primary efficacy end point is the mean change from baseline in percent inflammation on biopsy at 7 months and it 
will be compared between the two treatment groups by ANOVA using the mITT1 analysis sample.  The primary endpoint 
data will be summarized in the 2 groups using boxplots , along with means and 95% confidence intervals. 
15.3.2.4  Secondary Efficacy Endpoints  
Table 8 describes secondary efficacy endpoints and their corresponding parameters to be estimated in the study.  
Efficacy endpoints will be listed or summarized, as appropriate, using standard descri ptive statistics for continuous and

15.3.2.5  Supportive Analyses of the Primary Efficacy Endpoints  
In addition to the primary efficacy endpoint analysis described above, several supportive analyses will be performed:  
1. Since the occurrence of treated rejection prior to or at the time of the 7 month bio psy may confound 
the measurement of inflammation, the ANOVA described above will be repeated deleting any subjects 
from the analysis who had treated rejection prior to the 7 month biopsy. 
2. Since clinical site , donor type,  and race may confound the interpretation of the primary analysis, 
ANCOVA will be used to separately test for the effect of site , donor type,  and race on the primary 
endpoint analysis. 
3. If the PP sample differs from the mITT1 sample, the primary endpoint analysis will be repeated on the PP an alysis sample.

Three of the mechanistic assays, CRM, SORT, and DEU, which have high level of sensitivity and specificity, will be used to 
evaluate mechanistic efficacy endpoints  (Table 9 ).

15.3.2.7  Analyses of Exploratory  Endpoints  
Planned  mechanistic assays other than  CRM, SORT, and DEU are for exploratory assessment of the impact of specific 
therapies on inflammation and borderline rejection. Any statistically significant results from these tests will be reported 
as requiring independent verification and will provide a basis for further studies.    
Treatment groups and comparators:  We will analyze the readouts on assays longitudinally. Patient measurements will 
be obtained before and after treatment. There will be at least 2 time points recorded for the TASK trial (befo re and after 
Treg infusion). The primary interest of analysis is to compare longitudinal changes in assays between different groups: 
SCI with SOC, and SCI with polyTregs. Two groups of patients, those with normal histology and those with acute 
rejection on the 6 -month surveillance biopsy, will serve as negative and positive controls respectively for the 
mechanistic studies. We expect the changes over time in these assays to be approximately linear. If after examination of the data appears to not be the case  then we will either transform the assay measures or model the time axis time points 
as an unordered factor  (similar to repeated measures ANOVA, but without the requirement for fully balanced data).

3. reasons for early termination  
4. all reported AEs  
 Interim  Analyses   
No formal interim analyses of this study are planned.  
 Sample Size Considerations   
No formal sample size calculations will be performed on the primary safety endpoint as it is descriptive in nature.  However, sample sizes calculations were done based on the primary efficacy endpoint.   There is no previous data to 
guide the estimation of treatment effect size and variance for the assessment of clinical efficacy. For the primary efficacy 
endpoint analysis , which  is the mean reduction in inflammation from baseline at 7 months after study group allocation 
in the mITT1 analysis sample compared between the 2 groups, we have used a two sample 2 -sided t-test to determine 
the estimated power for differences in mean redu ction between the treatment groups (ranging from 10 -50% reduction 
in inflammation) at different standard deviations (SD) of the mean change in inflammation (ranging from10 -30%).   These 
power estimates are shown in the following Figure 9  and

With group sizes of 7 , we would achieve at least 9 0% power in the primary efficacy endpoint analysis to detect a 3 0% 
difference between the groups in the percent reduction in inflammation if the standard deviation i s 15 or less .  Due to 
the relatively small sample size, all secondary endpoint analyse s will be performed  as descriptive analyses rather than 
statistical comparisons between groups.

  Protocol Deviations 
 Protocol  Deviation  Definitions  
Protocol Deviation – The investigators and site staff will conduct the study in accordance to the protocol; no deviations 
from the protocol are permitted.  Any change, divergence, or departure from the study design or procedures constitutes 
a protocol deviation.  As a result of any deviation, corrective actions will be developed by the site and implemented 
promptly.  
Major Protocol Deviation - A Protocol Deviation is a variance  from the IRB approved protocol that may affect the 
subject's rights, safety, or well-being and/or the completeness, accuracy and reliability of the study data.   In addition, 
protocol deviations include willful or knowing breach es of human subject protection regulations, or poli cies, any action 
that is inconsistent with the NIH Human Research Protection Program’s research, medical, and ethical principles , and a 
serious or continuing noncompliance with federal, state, local or institutional human subject protection regulations, 
policies, or procedures .  
Non-Major  Protocol Deviation - A non- major  protocol deviation is any change, divergence, or departure from the study 
design or procedures of a research protocol that  does not have a major impact on the subject's rights, safety or we ll-
being, or the completeness, accuracy and reliability of the study data.  
 Reporting  and Managing Protocol  Deviations  
The study site principal investigator  has the responsibility to identify, document and report protocol deviations  as 
directed by the study  Sponsor .  However, protocol deviations may also be identified during site monitoring visits or 
during other forms of study conduct review.  
Upon determination that a protocol deviation has occurred, the study staff will complete a Protocol Deviation form . 
Protocol deviation reports  will be compiled and review ed by the NIAID/DAIT and the DSMB .  Sites will be responsible for 
reporting deviations to local IRB’s, as per local requirements.

  Ethical Considerations and Compliance with Good Clinical Practice 
 Statement of Compliance  
This clinical study will be conducted using good clinical practice (GCP), as delineated in Guidance for Industry: E6 Good 
Clinical Practice Consolidated Guidance , and according to the criteria specified in this study pr otocol.  Before study 
initiation, the protocol and the informed consent documents will be reviewed and approved by each site IRB .  Any 
amendments to the protocol or to the consent materials will also be approved by the respective IRB before they are 
implemented. 
 Informed  Consent Process  
The consent process will provide information about the study to a prospective participant and will allow adequate time 
for review and discussion prior to his/her decision.  The principal investigator or designee listed  on the FDA 1572 will 
review the consent and answer questions.  The prospective participant will be told that being in the trial is voluntary and 
that he or she may withdraw from the study at any time, for any reason.  All participants (or their legally ac ceptable 
representative) will read, sign, and date a consent form before undergoing any study procedures.  Consent materials will 
be presented in participants’ primary language. A copy of the signed consent form will be given to the participant.  
The consen t process will be  ongoing.  The consent form will be revised when important new safety information is 
available, the protocol is amended, and/or new information becomes available that may affect participation in the 
study.  
 Privacy and Confidentiality  
A participant’s privacy and confidentiality will be respected throughout the study.  Each participant will be assigned a 
unique identification number and these numbers rather than names will be used to collect, store, and report participant information.  Site personnel will not transmit documents containing personal health identifiers (PHI) to the study 
sponsor or their representatives.

2 Collect relevant trough level only, not necessarily both.  EVR trough levels should be obtained at least weekly until target level is reached/maintained.  
5 CBC at screening should be utilized for eligibility and determination of PBMC collection method.  CBC should be repeated prior to PBMC collection.    Renal Biopsy Specimens
Ɨ Entry into the study is based on results of a post-transplant standard of care surveillance biopsy.  This biopsy must be obtained at 5 months (+/- 8 w eeks) from the day of transplantation.  Screen 1 labs must be draw n ± 2 w eeks from the date of the biopsy,  keeping 
in mind lab results must be available within window for randomization.  Study group allocation must take place no more than 2 weeks after the central pathologist confirms eligibility.
1 HLA Typing, DSA, and viral serologies performed as part of evaluation for transplantation can be collected retrospectively.  If not available, serologic testing should be done within 2 weeks of screening biopsy.  EBV must be repeated 
within screening window if previously negative.x x x x x x xUrine Specimens

Infusion
Infusion can occur any time up 
to and including day 62 after 
central biopsy reading.  There is 
no low er limit other than those 
imposed by site and 
manufacturing scheduling.
Amendment 8: Group 1 SOE will maintain Day 0 as day of study group assignment.  Day 0 label was removed from the Group 2 and 3 SOE to avoid confusion.  For Group 2 and 3, the day of infusion will no longer be linked to study group 
assignment but rather to central biopsy reading confirmation.

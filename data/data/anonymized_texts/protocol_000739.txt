1. Background Information  
Oral hygiene products containing chemotherapeutic ingredients such as stannous fluoride have 
been shown to provide anti -plaque and anti -gingivitis benefits. Optimization of the delivery of the 
ingredients to the oral cavity is key to enhance the therapeuti c benefit s. The present study is 
designed to evaluate the plaque control benefit of  an 0.4% SnF2 preventive treatment gel.  
2. Study Objective  
The objective of the  study is to evaluate anti -plaque effi cacy of a preventive treatment gel  in a 
modified 4 -day plaque model.  
3. Overall Study Design and Plan  
This will be a controlled, examiner -blind, randomized,  2-treatment, 3-period cross -over 4 -day 
partial brushing plaque study. Up to  32 subjects will be enrolled into the study.  Prior to the 
treatment phase of the study , each subject will have a full mouth, supragingival dental prophylaxis 
and be provided with acclimation product.   Before the treatment period, s ubjects will be randomly 
assigned to a treatment sequence.  At the baseline visit of  each period, an Oral Soft Tissue Exam  
(OST) , a digital plaque imag e (DPIA) , and a plaque exam using Turesky Modified Quigley -Hein 
Plaque  Index  (TMQHPI) will be  conducted, followed by a polishing on both the lingual and buccal 
surfaces of the teeth . During the treatment phase, subjects will be asked to brush  with Crest 
Cavity Protection on their lingual surfaces for 30 seconds , then without expectoration, subjects 
will be instructed to swish with the slurry left in their mouth for 60 seconds.  After that, subjects 
will be asked to spit out the slurry and rinse their mouth with 20 ml water. Subjects assigned to 
the Treatment Gel  l Leg will have the  gel applied by site staff.  Only subjects assigned to the 
treatment gel will be  asked to stay at the site for 15 minutes following the gel application.   On Day 
4, subjects will return for a n OST Exam , a digital plaque imag e (DPIA) , and a final plaque exam  
(TMQHPI) . At period 2 Day 3, 10 min utes after product usage ,the subjects will be aske d to 
provide 5 ml of saliva into a label ed vial. There will be a washout period of approximately 7 days 
between treatment periods to prevent treatment carryover.

10.  Blinding, Labeling, and Shipping Plan   
Acclimation Kit Boxes  
Subjects will receive  2 tubes  of Crest Cavity Protection  dentifrice (over -labeled to blind the 
product ), one ADA soft manual toothbrush  and written usage instructions.  Subjects will use the 
dentifrice for acclimation and washout periods.   A new brush will  be distributed at the beginning 
of each washout  perio d.  These items will be shipped in subject kit boxes to the investigational 
site and distributed to the subjects by site personnel.   
Dentifrice Treatment Legs  
Product will be supplied in subject kit boxes.  Each kit will contain 1 over -labeled tube  of the 
assigned toothpaste, ADA  soft manual toothbrush , and subject instructions.  The shipping 
containers will be labeled with the "ship to" clinical site address and a "content statement" listing 
study nu mber and subject numbers contained within.  Supplemental product (4  boxes) will be 
provided.    
11. Determination of Sample Size  
Up to 32 subjects will be enrolled in the study.  Thirty subjects completing this study will provide 
at least 80% power to detect a mean difference of 0.15 between treatments for the whole mouth 
average TMQHPI score using two -sided testing with a 5% significance level.  This estimate 
assumes the model mean square error is 0.05 or smaller in a 3 -period design.  
12. Safety Variables  
Safety Ob servations and/or Measurements  
Adverse event data will not be solicited by the clinical investigation staff.  However, all 
volunteered AEs that have the potential to be product -related,  will be recorded  in the AE CRF.  
Safety will be assessed by the absenc e of irreversible side effects associated with u se of the test 
product.  
Oral Examination  
Assessment of the oral soft tissue is conducted via a visual examination of the oral cavity and 
perioral area utilizing a standard dental light, dental mirror, and ga uze.  The structures examined 
include the gingiva (free and attached), hard and soft palate, oropharynx/uvula, buccal mucosa, 
tongue, floor of the mouth, labial mucosa, mucobuccal/mucolabial folds, lips, and perioral area.  
Clinical Study Protocol Study No. 2018009  CONFIDENTIAL  
Page 12 of 16 Assessment of the oral hard tiss ues will be conducted via a visual examination of the dentition 
and restorations utilizing a standard dental light, dental mirror, and air syringe.  All abnormal 
findings will be recorded and categorized by their location; hard tissue findings will be cate gorized 
as “other .”  An AE will be recorded if a new abnormal finding is noted after product distribution or 
any previously noted abnormal finding increases in severity during the treatment period.  
13. Efficacy Variables  
Fluorescein Plaque Disclosing Procedure  and Digital Plaque Image Analysis (DPIA) Collection 
System and Analysis   
 
Fluorescein Plaque Disclosing Procedure  
• Rinse for 10 seconds with 25 ml of phosphate buffer;  
• Rinse for 1 minute with 5.0 ml of 1240 ppm fluorescein in phosphate buffer;  
• Rinse 3 times for 10 seconds with 25 ml of phosphate buffer . 
Digital Plaque Imaging Analysis Collection  
The photographic system consists of a high -resolution digital camera.   Two Long Wave UV flash 
lights located on each side of a camera provides the lighting.   The unit is connected to a personal 
computer, which records and analyzes the images.   Prior to daily use, the system is standardized 
to assure proper operation.   Additionally, a color standard is centered and imaged prior to 
imaging the subjects.   A digital image of the maxillary and mandibular anterior facial surfaces is 
captured.   Tooth and plaque pixels are quantified in the digital image and the percent plaque area 
on the teeth is calculated.  
Each image is collected in a darkened room.   The subject sits o n a stool in front of a chin rest 
used to hold the head still. The subject places the chin on the chin rest and then positions two 
sterile plastic retractors to retract the lips and cheeks.   It is also acceptable for the subject to 
position the retractors,  and then place the chin on the chin rest.   The subject is instructed to 
retract the lips and cheeks (toward the ears) as far as possible.   The incisal edges of the front 
teeth are placed about 5mm – 10mm from each other and centered in the camera.   Prior to 
exposure the subject is instructed to draw air through the teeth and to position the tongue away 
from the teeth so that the tongue is not visible.  The image is taken of the lips, teeth and gums 
only; the whole face is not visible in the image.  Each im age is saved in a file with the subject ID 
number.  
Plaque Examination  
The plaque deposits on the teeth will be scored on six surfaces ( distobuccal, midbuccal, 
mesiobuccal, distolingual, midlingual and mesiolingual)  of all 28 teeth (excluding 3rd molars, 
crowns and surfaces with cervical restorations) according to the Quigley -Hein Index as modified by 
Turesky et al which emphasizes plaque in contact with the gingiva .  Buccal, lingual, and whole 
mouth average plaque scores will be calculated for each subject and tooth surfaces by totaling 
the scores and dividing by the number of gradable sites examined .  Scoring criteria are shown in 
Table 3.

Examiner:  A. Das  
             Red Plaque Disclosing Dye Procedure and Preparation  
Approximately twenty (20) drops of undiluted plaque disclosing solution is dispensed directly from 
the manufacturer’s original bottle into plastic dosage cups. Study Subjects are given the dosage 
cup to swish the disclosing solution orally for 15 seconds a nd then expectorate. The Subjects 
then rinse with 10ml of tap water for 10 seconds and expectorate.  
Saliva Sample  
Subjects will be asked to expectorate approximately 2 mL of unstimulated saliva into a labeled 
tube.   The subjects will have up to 5 minutes to provide this amount. Collected s amples will be 
kept on ice at the site and then frozen at -70C. The  saliva samples will be analyzed for tin and 
fluoride  outside of the study protocol .  
14. Hypothesis  
For TMQHPI plaque scores ( whole mouth,  buccal and lingual  surfaces ) and percent plaque area  
the following hypotheses will be tested.  
Null:   The mean plaque score is equal between the treatments.  
Alternative:  The mean plaque score is not equal between the treatments.  
15. Statistical and Analytical Plans  
The primary endpoint is the whole mouth average TMQH PI plaque scores. Plaque scores and 
percent plaque area will be analyzed separately for each surface using a general linear mixed 
model.  The statistical model will include treatment and period as fixed e ffects as well as subject 
as a random effect.  Carryover effect will be assessed and  may be included in the model  if 
reasonably appropriate .  Baseline may be used as a covariate.  Statistical comparisons will be 
two-sided with a significance level of 0.05.   Additional analyses of the data may be performed.

Advertising  
If the Oral Health Science Center chooses to advertise for subjects, whether in professional or 
consumer publications, radio, television, or any other means, all advertising must be a pproved by 
the IRB prior to use, documented, and retained.  
Confidentiality  
Subject files will be maintained in a locked location for the duration of the study.  The recipients 
will treat this information confidentially.  In the event of any publication reg arding this study, 
subject identity will not be disclosed.  
Direct access to study records and source data/documentation, including subject medical 
records, will be provided as needed to appropriate parties for the purpose of trial -related 
monitoring, audit ing, IRB/IEC review, and regulatory inspection.  Prior to participating in the study, 
subjects will consent, in writing, to the release of their medical records for said purposes.  
Data Collection  
The Data Manager will supply the paper and/or electronic CRF s to be used in this study.  It is the 
responsibility of the Investigator to maintain and submit accurate and timely CRFs to the Sponsor.  
All hard copy CRFs will be filled out legibly in ink.  
All questions should be answered.  For paper CRFs, if an entry  requires correction, a single line 
will be placed through the entry so as not to obscure the original record, the corrected entry will 
be initialed and dated by the individual making the change, and a reason will be given for the 
change.  There will be no  whiteouts or erasures.  For electronic CRFs, if an entry requires 
correction, the change is made directly to the CRF in the database, the user is prompted to 
provide a reason for the change, and the correction is logged in by an electronic audit trail.  
As necessary, the Data Manager may make specified allowable changes to the database without 
issuing a query to the site, as agreed upon by study site per this protocol. Examples of allowable 
changes include incorrect date formats, incorrect current year reco rded (as in the start of a new 
year), and unambiguous spelling errors. Changes to common abbreviations and symbols to 
equivalent text to meet system or coding constraints (e.g., @ = at, ~ = approximately), may also 
be allowable. Values that are ambiguous o r open to interpretation will be queried to the sites.  It is 
the responsibility of the Data Manager to ensure all changes are supported by information 
contained elsewhere and/or are unambiguous.  
Source Documents  
The Investigator has the responsibility for  ensuring that all source documents (i.e., study and/or 
medical records) and CRFs are completed and maintained according to the study protocol and 
are available at the site.  Any CRF used as a source document must be identified as such in the 
Investigator Notebook.  
Good Clinical Practices  
This study is conducted in compliance with applicable sections of the US Federal Regulations 
governing informed consent (21 CFR 50), IRBs (21 CFR 56), study conduct (21 CFR 312) and 
Clinical Study Protocol Study No. 2018009  CONFIDENTIAL  
Page 15 of 16 the International Conference on Harmoniz ation’s Good Clinical Practice Consolidated Guidelines, 
[ICH-GCPs, as published by the FDA on 9  May 1997, Federal  Register, Volume 62, Number 90 
pages 25691 -25709]).  During the course of the trial, the clinical site is monitored by P&G staff 
(Clinical Tri al Manager or designee) to ensure compliance with the Protocol, regulations and 
guidelines, adequacy of the equipment and facilities, and satisfactory data collection.   
Informed Consent  
A subject consent form will comply with all applicable regulations go verning the protection of 
human subjects.  The elements of informed consent and the documentation of informed consent 
are specified in 21 CFR 50.25 and 50.27 and/or ICH GCPs chapter 4 .  Each subject must sign 
and date an informed consent to serve as a part icipant in the study.  A signed copy of the consent 
form will be given to the subject and a signed copy will be retained by the Oral Health Science 
Center.   Subjects may withdraw from participation in the study at any time.  Additionally, the 
Investigator may withdraw subjects from the study if it is in the best interest of the subjects.  The 
reason for all subject withdrawals from the study will be documented on the appropriate CRF.  
Institutional Review  
Prior to study initiation, the Investigator must obta in institutional review and approval of both the 
Protocol and the consent form, in compliance with the US Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, 
Part 56 or the ICH -GCPs Consolidated Guidelines, Chapter 3.  The Investigator maintains any 
original authorizat ion letter(s) and forwards copies to P&G.  IRB approval letters should include 
the study title, P&G study number, the address of the IRB, date of request, and the signature of 
the IRB chairperson/designate.  Additionally, the letter must acknowledge that b oth the Protocol 
and consent form have been approved by the IRB, with notification of any changes required.  The 
study does not begin until P&G has received written confirmation of IRB approval.  This IRB shall 
also review the investigation at least once a  year during study execution.  The Investigator 
notifies the IRB when the study is terminated . 
Monitoring  
Prior to commencement of the study, an initiation meeting will be held with the appropriate Oral 
Health Science Center personnel to review the objecti ves and procedures of the clinical trial.  To 
assure accurate, complete, consistent, and reliable data, the Oral Health Science Center and 
study procedures will be monitored by a Clinical Trial Manager  in accordance with 21 CFR 312 
and ICH GCPs Chapter 5.  
The Oral Health Science Center study coordinator is expected to contact the Clinical Trial 
Manager or designee as needed regarding study concerns and/or questions.  
Protocol Amendments/Changes  
Changes to the Protocol following Institutional Review Board (IR B) approval affecting the safety 
of subjects, scope/objectives of the investigation, or the scientific quality of the study are 
documented as amendments.  Such changes require P&G, Investigator, and IRB approval prior 
to implementation, unless immediate ac tion is required to safeguard subject safety.  
Administrative/minor changes (e.g., typos, changes in P&G personnel [excluding medical 
monitor], etc.) are documented as revisions but do not have to be submitted as amendments 
unless required by the IRB.  Any  change in P&G’s monitoring staff, Clinical Trial Manager or 
Medical Monitor during the conduct of the study, must be reported to the Investigator.

Page 16 of 16 Study Medication Dispensing, Storage and Accounting  
Study products are stored in a secure area, under enviro nmental condition as required by label 
instructions or as described in the Protocol, and dispensed only under the authorization of the 
Investigator.  The storage condition shall be properly documented.  Both the receipt and 
dispensation of all test product s (used and unused) are documented using forms provided by 
P&G or suitable forms provided by the site.  Study products are returned to P&G following the 
trial, or alternatively, they are destroyed at the clinical site provided the site has an existing SOP 
for the destruction of clinical materials and prior written approval from P&G.  
Study Termination  
The study is terminated upon completion of all subject treatments and evaluation.  The study may 
be discontinued at any time.  
Subject Consent  
The Investigator obtains written informed consent for each subject prior to that subject’s 
participation in the study, per the US Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 50.25 and 
50.27 and ICH -GCPs, Chapter 4, subpart 4.8.  Subjects, or their legal guardian, are requ ired to 
read, sign and date an IRB approved consent form with the Investigator also maintaining a signed 
and dated copy.  The subject or legal guardian will be given a copy of the consent form.  All study 
procedures must be explained in non -technical terms .

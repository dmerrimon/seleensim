IRB Version Date:  November 10, 2016   1.0 Background 
 
1.1 Introduction  
MV-NIS is an attenuated measles virus, engineered to express the human thyroidal 
sodium-iodide symporter (NIS).  The virus is selectively oncolytic, targeting and 
destroying tumor cells through CD46, a membrane regulator of complement activation that is known to be overexpressed on many human malignancies. CD46 is the cellular 
receptor for MV-NIS, mediating both virus en try and subsequent cell killing through cell-
cell fusion. The cytopathic effect of MV-N IS increases exponentially as the density of 
CD46 receptors on target cells increases and is  therefore dramatic at high CD46 receptor 
densities (tumor) but minimal at low densities (normal tissues).  NIS expression in MV-NIS infected cells permits noninvasive mon itoring of virus spread by serial gamma 
camera imaging of radioiodine uptake.  In addition, the anti-neoplastic activity of the 
virus can be amplified by administering I-131,  a potently ionizing beta emitting isotope 
of radioiodine.  Multiple myeloma is an incu rable malignancy of terminally differentiated 
plasma cells that is widely disseminated at diagnosis.  Myeloma plasma cells over-
express CD46 and are therefore highly susceptible to MV-NIS.  Also, systemic virus 
administration is feasible in advanced myeloma since these patients have greatly reduced 
circulating titers of anti-measles antibodies.   MV-NIS demonstrated considerable 
oncolytic potency when administered intravenously to rodents bearing human myeloma 
xenografts.  Also, intratumoral spread of th e virus could be monitored non-invasively by 
radioiodine imaging and the anti-neoplastic potency of the virus was significantly boosted by I-131.  We therefore propose to cond uct a phase I clinical trial to evaluate the 
safety of MV-NIS administered intravenous ly to patients with advanced treatment-
refractory multiple myeloma, to determine th e maximum tolerated dose by this route, to 
perform pharmacokinetic studies to determine the location of virus-infected cells, the time course of viral gene expression, the evolu tion of the immune response and its impact 
on the virus, and to obtain preliminary evidence for anti-myeloma activity in human 
subjects.  Our overall hypothesis is that MV-NIS administered intravenously to patients 
with advanced multiple myeloma will selectively propagate in myeloma deposits 
throughout the body, leading to tumor cell killing and reduction of tumor burden.  This 
hypothesis will be tested by serial gamma ca mera imaging of radioiodine uptake after 
MV-NIS therapy to monitor the changing number and location of virus-infected cells.  
 
1.2 MV-NIS: Description 
 
MV-NIS is a live tissue culture adapted meas les virus engineered to express the human 
thyroidal sodium iodide symporter (NIS).  The virus propagates selectively in human 
cancer cells, leading directly to tumor cell killing.  MV-NIS-infected tumor cells express NIS, a membrane ion channel that actively transports iodide ions into the cell.  
Radioiodine uptake by cells expressing NIS provides a basis for in vivo  radioiodine 
imaging studies to reveal the profile of MV -NIS gene expression and the location of MV-
NIS-infected cells during virus spread and elimination.  MV-NIS was constructed by 
inserting the NIS gene into a full-length inf ectious molecular clone of an attenuated 
Edmonston lineage measles virus (MV-tag) and propagates on Vero cells with kinetics equivalent to the parental strain. 
 
MC038C 6 MCCC Addendum 23 
IRB Version Date:  November 10, 2016   1.21 MV-NIS: Mechanism of tumor targeting 
MV-NIS is selectively oncolytic, target ing and destroying tumor cells through 
CD46, a membrane regulator of complement  activation, that is typically over-
expressed on human malignancies [1-3].  CD46 is the major cellular receptor for 
MV-NIS, mediating virus attachment entr y and subsequent cell killing through 
cell-cell fusion [4].  The CD46 tropism of attenuated Edmonston lineage measles 
viruses was acquired during tissue culture adaptation [5] and distinguishes them 
from wild-type measles viruses, which enter cells primarily through an 
alternative receptor, SLAM, expressed on activated T cells, B cells and 
monocytes [6].  MV-NIS has dual tropism for both SLAM and CD46.  
 The cytopathic effect of MV-NIS increases exponentially as the density of CD46 receptors on target cells increases.  Killing is therefore minimal at the lower CD46 receptor densities that typify normal tissues whereas it is dramatic at 
higher CD46 receptor densities associated with the neoplastic phenotype.  CD46 
regulates complement activation by acting as a co-factor for factor I-mediated cleavage of C3b and thereby protects the cells on which it is expressed from complement-mediated lysis [1, 2].  Numerous studies have demonstrated that CD46 is expressed at higher levels on hum an tumors of many different lineages 
than on their non-transformed counterparts [1, 3].  Thus, MV-NIS is a new class of antineoplastic agent that targets a widely expressed tumor phenotype; namely, a high membrane expression of CD46. 
 
1.22 MV-NIS: Radioiodine uptake 
NIS is an intrinsic membrane protein of  643 amino acids that spans the plasma 
membrane 13 times with three potential sites for N-linked glycosylation.  NIS is a symporter that imports two sodium ions with every iodide ion transported into the cell.  NIS expression in thyroid follicular cells has been exploited for more than 50 years in clinical practice for thyroid imaging (with 
123I or Tc99m) or 
ablation (with 131I) and for systemic therapy of well-differentiated thyroid 
malignancies [7, 8].  It has recently been  shown that radioiodine is efficiently 
trapped by experimental tumors trans duced with a NIS gene [9-15].  Non-
invasive assessment of NIS gene e xpression can then be achieved through  -
camera imaging of 123I uptake, and tumor ablation can be achieved by 
administration of 131I as a source of ionizing radiation.  The local bystander 
killing potential of NIS gene therapy is  considerable because the average tissue 
path-length of the   particles emitted by 131I is approximately 6 cell diameters 
[16].  Tumor cell lines and primary tumor cells infected with MV-NIS show efficient uptake of radioiodine that can be inhibited by perchlorate, a specific 
inhibitor of NIS.  Moreover, in vivo  uptake of radioiodine by MV-NIS-infected 
tumor xenografts is readily detected by 
123I -camera imaging.  
 
1.3 Multiple myeloma: Need for alternative therapies  
 
Multiple myeloma is a disseminated malignancy of antibody-secreting plasma cells [17].  
The neoplastic cells preside predominantly in bone and bone marrow where they secrete 
a monoclonal immunoglobulin and proliferate to form discrete, well-vascularized tumors (myelomas) that strongly stimulate osteoc lastic bone resorption.  The monoclonal 
immunoglobulin provides a convenient serum or urine marker for disease monitoring, but can also cause significant clinical pathology including renal failure, hyperviscosity and 
tissue amyloid deposition.  Other classic disease manifestations are bone pain, 
MC038C 7 MCCC Addendum 23 
IRB Version Date:  November 10, 2016   hypercalcemia, pathological fractures, anemia  and recurrent infections due to profound 
suppression of humoral immunity.   
 
Multiple myeloma is not curable with curre nt therapy and was expected to cause 10,800 
deaths in the USA in 2002 [18].  Median survival is approximately four years and new 
approaches to therapy are urgently required.  The disease responds initially to alkylating agents (melphalan, cyclophosphamide) and corticosteroids (prednisolone, 
dexamethasone), but eventually becomes refractory.  High dose (myeloablative) 
melphalan therapy following by autologous stem cell transplantation leads to better 
remissions but does not greatly prolong survival [19-21].  Thalidomide and the proteosome inhibitor, PS341, have activity against myeloma but have not yet been shown to impact survival [22, 23].  Supportive th erapy includes analgesia for pain, regular blood 
transfusions or erythropoietin therapy for an emia, bisphosphonates to inhibit osteoclastic 
bone resorption and antibiotics or intravenous immunoglobulins for infections.   
 
1.4 Safety of measles vaccine in myeloma pa tients despite suppression of humoral immunity  
 
Multiple myeloma is unique amongst human malignancies in that because of the 
associated suppression of humoral immunity, systemic administration of a therapeutic 
virus is feasible, even if previous virus exposure has occurred.  Successful deployment of 
oncolytic viruses for the treatment of disseminated malignancy requires efficient delivery to tumor sites via the bloodstream, which can be inhibited by antiviral antibodies [24]. Oncolytic virotherapy is therefore less likel y to be effective when there is preexisting 
antiviral immunity.  Multiple myeloma is characterized by profound suppression of 
humoral immune responses with hypogammagl obulinemia, typically affecting IgG, IgA 
and IgM fractions [25-27].  Antibody titers  against common vaccine antigens (e.g., 
measles, mumps, rubella, diphtheria and te tanus) are greatly reduced [28, 29], and 
immune responses following vaccination are consid erably impaired [27, 30].  We tested 
stored serum samples from patients with h eavily pretreated myeloma and age-matched 
controls for anti-measles virus antibody tite r and found, in keeping with published 
observations, that sera obtained from myeloma patients often contained very low levels 
of anti-measles antibody.    The measles-mumps-rubella (MMR II) vaccine (Merck) delivers 10
3 
to 104 
infectious 
units of live attenuated measles virus to each human recipient. Patients who undergo 
autologous or allogeneic stem cell transplantation lose imm une memory for past exposure 
to infectious agents and vaccines and theref ore require a re-vaccination strategy which 
typically includes live-attenuated measles-mu mps-rubella vaccine at 24 months post-
transplant. We retrospectively studied mu ltiple myeloma (MM) patients who received 
both their transplant and routine 2 year pos t-auto SCT vaccination with MMR II at Mayo 
Clinic. Thirty-six patients (M:F – 23:13) who received an autologous stem cell 
transplantation (auto SCT) and also received routine 2 year post-SCT MMR II 
vaccination at Mayo Clinic were identified. MMR II re-vaccination was delivered an 
average of 799 days (range: 539 - 1209) days  after SCT. Follow-up time after re-
vaccination averaged 755 days (range: 56 - 2345). Thirty-three of the 36 patients studied, remain alive. Most of these patients have experienced disease relapse requiring treatment. 
Eleven patients continue under observation w ithout treatment since their original SCT. 
Overall, there was no significant change after re-vaccination in the patients' absolute lymphocyte counts or immunoglobulin levels, nor was there significant change in the monoclonal protein levels. No specific toxicities were documented following MMR 
administration. While 5 patients did have a small decrease in monoclonal protein level, 
MC038C 8 MCCC Addendum 23 
IRB Version Date:  November 10, 2016   averaging only 0.42g/dL (range: 0.1- 1.2) afte r re-vaccination, only 2 of the 5 patients 
were remote from the influence of treatment effect for relapsed disease at the time. One 
of these 5 patients continues to live relapse free without treatment and with a stable 
monoclonal protein. These data strongly suggests that conventional doses of MMR 
vaccine administered by intramuscular injec tion are safe, but inadequate for expression of 
oncolytic activity in patients with multiple myeloma.  
 
Although MV-NIS has not previously been administered to humans, there is a vast knowledge base concerning the toxic effects of closely related viruses in the human 
population.  Thus wild-type MV causes a we ll-described illness characterized by fever, 
rash, upper respiratory tract symptoms and transient immunosuppression [32]. The case 
fatality rate in the United States of Amer ica is 0.1 to 0.2 %, but is higher in 
underdeveloped countries where opportuni stic infections secondary to MV 
immunosuppression are a more significant problem.  At the other end of the spectrum, 
live attenuated MV vaccines have been used extensively.  In the USA alone, more than 
550 million doses of MV vaccine have been di stributed to date.  Several different 
members of the Edmonston virus lineage have b een used for vaccination, and all of them 
are capable of causing a mild measles-like illness in some variable percentage of 
vaccinees [33-34, 39] It is therefore anticipated that some MV-NIS-treated patients may 
develop a measles-like illness.  However, in th e entire history of measles vaccination, no 
case of reversion of vaccine strain to wild-t ype measles has been documented, and only 6 
deaths have been reported due  to uncontrolled spread of the vaccine strain virus in 
severely immunocompromised individuals. In contrast to their effects in non-immune 
subjects, neither wild-type nor attenuated me asles viruses cause a measles-like illness in 
patients previously exposed to the virus [41].  
 1.5 Multiple myeloma: Susceptibility to MV-NIS 
 Neoplastic plasma cells from multiple myelom a patients express high levels of CD46 and 
are fully susceptible to infection by MV-NIS.  Myeloma cells over-express CD46 
compared to normal marrow elements and unstimulated peripheral blood lymphocytes.  
CD138+ myeloma cells from 5 patient bone ma rrow aspirates were infected with MV-
NIS, and radioiodine uptake was measured 48 hours later.  In addition to the classical measles virus cytopathic effect of cell-cell fusion, the infected cells were shown to 
efficiently concentrate radioiodine achieving intracellular concentrations 50-fold higher 
than that of the incubation medium.   
 
Multiple myeloma cells are selectively infect ed and killed by attenuated measles viruses 
of the Edmonston vaccine lineage.  A re combinant measles virus expressing a fluorescent 
GFP marker protein could efficiently fuse  and kill multiple myeloma cells but not non-
transformed cells [31].  
 
Intravenous MV-NIS (or MV-Edm) is a pot ent oncolytic agent in multiple myeloma 
xenograft models.  Multiple myeloma cells (ARH77, RPMI8226, KAS 6/1, MM1) were implanted subcutaneously into the flanks of athymic or SCID mice and the mice were treated intravenously with MV-NIS or MV -Edm (identical sequence to MV-NIS but 
lacking the NIS gene).  Intravenous administration of MV-Edm caused complete 
regression of ARH77 xenografts and significantly slowed the progression of RPMI8226 
xenograft growth.  Moreover, a single intrav enous dose of MV-NIS led to complete 
regression of large (0.5 mm diameter) KAS 6/1 xenografts.  
 
MC038C 9 MCCC Addendum 23 
IRB Version Date:  November 10, 2016   1.51 Therapy models: Noninvasive imaging of MV-NIS 
Intratumoral spread of MV-NIS could be non-invasively evaluated by serial -
camera imaging in 3 myeloma xenogr aft models.  SCID mice bearing 
subcutaneous ARH77, KAS 6/1 or MM 1 myeloma xenografts were injected 
intravenously with a single dose of MV-Edm or MV-NIS (2 x 106 IU).  Three, 9 
and 17 days later, 123I (18.5 MBq) was administered and -camera imaging 
performed after 1 hour.  All tumors treate d with the control virus MV-Edm were 
negative by -photon imaging, whereas all MV-NIS treated tumors were able to 
concentrate radioiodine and could be visualized by -camera imaging.  Analysis 
of the changing image intensity over the period of 17 days established that NIS 
expression peaks approximately 9 days after virus injection, presumably reflecting the maximum extent of the virus infection. 
 
1.52 Therapy models: Radiovirotherapy 
The oncolytic activity of MV-NIS is  greatly enhanced by subsequent 
administration of 131I (radiovirotherapy).  To determine whether the oncolytic 
effect of MV-NIS could be enhanced or accelerated by high energy electron therapy resulting from intratumoral 
131I decay, we examined KAS 6/1 and MM1 
models.  The MM1 model had been previously shown to be resistant to single agent MV-NIS therapy.  KAS 6/1 tumor regression was significantly accelerated 
when mice were treated with 
131I (37 MBq) administered 6 days after intravenous 
MV-NIS.  Moreover, MM1 xenografts, which were resistant to single agent 
therapy with MV-Edm, MV-NIS or 131I, were shown to regress completely when 
131I was administered 9 days after intravenous MV-NIS. 
 
1.6 Modulating the Anti-Measles Immune Response 
 MV-CEA is an oncolytic measles virus expressing a soluble marker peptide (the 
extracellular domain of CEA) which facilita tes noninvasive monitoring of viral gene 
expression.  When MV-CEA was administered intraperitoneally to naïve measles-susceptible (CD46 transgenic IFN receptor knockout) mice, plasma CEA expression 
peaked after 3 days and disappeared by day 8.   However, no plasma CEA was detected in 
mice previously vaccinated with MV-Edmonston and challenged at a later date with the 
same dose of MV-CEA.  We therefore examined the profiles of CEA expression, anti-measles antibody responses, and susceptibility to second virus challenge in mice that 
received immunosuppressive cyclophosphamide therapy prior to intraperitoneal injection 
of 10
7 IU of MV-CEA.  Cyclophosphamide treatment (250 mg/kg IP 4 hours before MV-
CEA) prolonged the CEA expression profile from 8 days to 29 days, reduced the anti-
measles antibody titers (measured on day 36) and resulted in significant levels of CEA gene expression 3 days post-MV-CEA recha llenge (without additio nal cyclophosphamide 
day 53).   
 
1.7 Pre-Clinical Data: MV-NIS toxicity and biodistribution studies 
 
1.71 Biodistribution in CD46 transgenic, interferon α/β receptor knockout mice 
 
As part of preclinical studies to evaluate MV-NIS, we developed sensitive 
quantitative RT-PCR methodology in order to  characterize tissue distribution of 
the virus in non-tumor bearing transgenic IfnarKO 
x CD46 Ge mice that express 
human CD46 with human-like tissue distribution. Groups of male and female 
MC038C 10 MCCC Addendum 23

NIS, 105 
TCID 50, 107 
TCID 50 or 107 
TCID 50 + 125 mg/kg cytoxan. MV-NIS tissue 
distribution was studied non-invasively by Micro-SPECT CT imaging 4, 21 and 
90 days after a dose of 0.5 mCi I- 123. MV-NIS expression in tissues was 
measured 2, 5, 22 and 91 days after treat ment (5 mice/gender/treatment group) by 
quantitative RT-PCR. Imaging studies showed that functional NIS was not 
detected in tissues other than those with normal expression after 
administration of MV-NIS.  Highest concentrations of MV-NIS (> 10,000 MV-N 
RNA copies/ µg total RNA) appeared in lung, liver, spleen and blood of both male and female mice 2 days  after administration of 10
7 
TCID50 +/- 
cyclophosphamide. Cyclophosphamide did not delay clearance of MV-NIS 
from tissues. Blood concentrations remained high on day 5, and fell to 
undetectable levels in blood on day 91. Lung and liver concentrations fell to 
undetectable levels by day 91. Spleen con centrations were substantially lower on 
day 5 and day 22, and detectable in only 5 of 24 mice given high dose MV-NIS +/- cyclophosphamide on day 91. Of no te, 277 – 44093 (median, 440) copies 
MV-NIS/ µg total RNA were detected in brain in 3/10 mice on day 2, 2/10 mice on day 5, 3 of 10 mice on day 22, and 3 of 16 mice on day 91. The positive samples were detected only in mice treated with 10

MV-NIS + 
cyclophosphamide.  
 
1.72 Toxicity of MV-NIS in CD46 transgenic, interferon α/β receptor knockout mice 
According to the protocol 144 IfnarKO 
x CD46 Ge mice (12/sex/dose group), 
approximately 6 to 8 weeks old on the fi rst day of dosing were randomly divided 
into 6 dose groups and treated with one or both of the test articles (MV-NIS: 
Measles virus, Edmonston lineage [NSC-731414] for Groups 3, 4, 5 and 6 and 
cyclophosphamide [NDC# 0015-0547-41] fo r Groups 2 and 6) or the control 
article (MV-NIS vehicle [5% sucrose, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2mM MgCl 2] 
diluted as per Test Article) via an intravenous injection via the tail vein. Cyclophosphamide was at 125mg/kg given 2 days prior (Day -2) to MV-NIS in 
order to modulate the immune response to MV-NIS. Cyclophosphamide and 
MV-NIS were given as a single intravenous  bolus injection through the tail vein. 
On study days 2, 5, 22, and 91 six mice/dose group were euthanized and a complete necropsy examination was performed by PAI personnel as described in the protocol. Protocol-specified tissues were preserved in 10% neutral-buffered 
formalin (NBF) and sent to PAI’s Freder ick, MD facility, which conducted the 
remainder of the analysis on those samples.

Mayo Clinic Toxicology Core ran the in-life portion of the studies, including monitoring clinical signs and weights daily the first week post article administration, and weekly thereafter. At time of necropsy, final weights were taken, and mice were bled from the retroorbital plexus. Blood parameters 
analyzed included: hematology (white blood cell count, lymphocyte percent, 
monocyte percent, granulocyte percent, red blood cell count,  mean corpuscular 
volume, hematocrit, mean corpuscular hemoglobin, mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration, red cell distribution width, hemoglobin, platelet count, mean platelet volume, and platelet distribution width); clinical chemistry (albumin, alkaline phosphatase, alanine aminotransferase, amylase, total bilirubin, blood urea nitrogen, calcium, phos phorus, creatinine, glucose, sodium, 
potassium, total protein, and globulin); and coagulation (prothrombin time and 
activated partial thromboplastin time). Pl asma was also collected for anti-measles 
antibody titers. The in-life portion of the study started March 7th, 2005 and ended June 8
th, 2005.  There were no clinical signs or deaths considered to be 
related to the test articles MV-NIS or cyclophosphamide . Body weights showed 
no signs of MV-NIS toxicity. Mice from Groups 4 and 5 developed robust anti-
measles virus titers at the later time points of days 22 and 91 post-virus 
administration.  In contrast, the lowest dose of virus (1x104 
TCID 50) in Group 3 
mice induced poor to non-detectable titers post single administration, indicating 
that greater than 1x104 
TCID 50 of MV-NIS is needed intravenously for the mice 
to mount and effective antibody response.  
 
In Groups 1, 3, 4, and 5, there were no toxicologic findings in the hematology or coagulation that were considered to be related to the administration of MV-NIS. 
In clinical chemistry, there were sporad ic mild elevations in ALT in 3 virus 
treated mice that were not correlated with any pathological changes in the liver. 
Total protein levels were mildly elevated  in Groups 3, 4, and 5 as compared to 
control Group 1. This rise in total protein and/or globulin in virus-treated groups 
is likely due to the production of an ti-measles immunoglobulin. Groups 4 and 5 
BUN levels were mildly decreased as compared to control Group 1, but were not accompanied by any pathologic changes in the kidneys. These changes were 
considered related to the administration of MV-NIS, but not of significant 
toxicity.  
 
MC038C 12 MCCC Addendum 23 
IRB Version Date:  November 10, 2016   In Groups 2 and 6, there were no toxicol ogic findings in coagulation that were 
considered to be related to the admini stration of MV-NIS. In hematology, the 
total WBC in Group 6 was depressed as compared to Group 2, suggesting that 
the additional challenge of MV-NIS to mice pre-treated with cyclophosphamide 
further suppressed the WBC. In clinical chemistry, there were sporadic mild 
elevations of creatinine considered to be related to the administration of MV-NIS, though the mice with elevated creatinine did not correspond to mice that showed changes in kidney pathology.  
 
Upon histological analysis of mouse tissues, there were no toxicologic findings 
in tissues considered to be related to the administration of MV-NIS.  Mice 
receiving pre-treatment with cyclophosphamide showed changes in the lymphoid 
organs (mandibular and mesenteric lymph nodes, thymus, and spleen), urinary bladder, bone marrow, testes and ovaries that  were considered to be related to the 
administration of cyclophosphamide at the day 2 sacrifice. The cyclophosphamide-related changes showed evidence of recovery in later time 
points.  
 
1.73 Imaging study of iodine biodistribut ion in MV-NIS treated squirrel monkeys  
Two male squirrel monkeys (Saimiri sciureus) received a single intravenous dose of 10
8 
TCID50 MV-NIS. NIS expression in tissues was evaluated by noninvasive 
SPECT/CT imaging of I-123 biodistribution at  baseline and on days 3, 8, 15 and 
22 after MV-NIS administration. Images were obtained at 1 and 2 hours after isotope administration. Detailed analysis of  the data is not yet complete but, by 
naked eye examination of the serial images, the isotope localizes to the thyroid, 
stomach, salivary glands and bladder at all timepoints and the biodistribution 
does not appear to change fo llowing MV-NIS administration .  
 
1.74 Safety study of intravenous MV-NIS in squirrel monkeys  
This study was performed by IIT Resear ch Institute (IITRI) in Chicago, IL 
through the RAID program. According to the protocol, 12 male squirrel monkeys 
(Saimiri sciureus, 3/group) were intrav enously dosed once with either MV-NIS 
or control article (saline) on study day 1. Animals in Groups II and IV were 
intravenously dosed once with cyclopho sphamide on study day 2. Two monkeys 
per group were sacrificed on study day 29, and the remaining animals were 
sacrificed on study day 91. See table below.  
 
All monkeys were evaluated for mortality/morbidity twice daily throughout the treatment and observation periods. All monkeys were observed for abnormal 
clinical signs at least once daily. Body wei ghts were recorded on days 1, 8, 5, 29, 
and 91 and body temperatures were reco rded pretest, 3 hours post-dosing on day 
1 and on days 2 through 5 and 8. Clini cal chemistry and hematology parameters 
were evaluated at the pretest and on days 3, 10, 15, 29, and 91. Thyroid hormone levels (TSH and T4 levels) were evalua ted on days 29 and 91. Cytokine levels 
(IL-1, IL-6, IL-12 and TNF levels) were evaluated on days 1, 4, 8, 29 and 91. 
Anti-MV antibody levels were evaluated at the Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, on 
days 8, 15, 29, and 91. Samples cont aining epithelial cells and saliva were 
collected pretest and on days 1, 4 8, 29 and 91, and blood samples were collected on days 1, 4, 8, 29, and 91. MV-NIS le vels were determined from these samples 
by PCR at the Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN. Two monkeys/groups were sacrificed on day 29, and the remaining animals were sacrificed on day 91. 
MC038C 13 MCCC Addendum 23 
IRB Version Date:  November 10, 2016   Tissues were collected, examined and fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin at 
necropsy. Samples of all fixed tissues were embedded and put into blocks. Microscopic pathology was performed on all tissues. Statistical analysis of 
continuous data through day 29 were perfo rmed using analysis of variance with 
post-hoc comparisons made using Dunne tt’s test with a minimum significance 
level of p ≤ 0.05.  
 
There were no premature or unscheduled deaths during the study. No adverse 
clinical signs were observed during the study.  No meaningful effects on body 
weights or body weight gains were noted during the study. There were no 
treatment-related effects noted for any c linical pathology parameters evaluated 
(hematology and clinical chemistry). No  changes were observed in cytokine 
levels during the study. Lesions observe d at necropsy included enlarged, dark-
pigmented lymph nodes, small thymus and red focus on medial lobe of liver. All 
gross findings were interpreted as inci dental and not treatment-related. No 
treatment-related histopathologic changes were observed. Pending results for 
thyroid hormone levels and viral levels.

Preliminary Q-RT PCR on cheek swabs is summarized in  table above.  There was no virus detected at any 
time point for Groups I and II. However, in Groups III and IV there were low levels of viremia on day 1, 
which dropped by day 2, but increased significantly by day 8 to 15, but again dropped by days 29 and 91. Anti-measles IgG antibodies remained  undetectable in Groups I and II, but in Groups III and IV became 
detectable by day 15 and pers isted through day 29 and 91. These data would suggest that IV MV-NIS 
circulates, replicates, and clears over time and that replication is enhanced by cyclophosphamide.  
These Q-RT-PCR data also support our choice of time- points for imaging patients—that is days 8-15. 
  
MC038C 14 MCCC Addendum 23 
IRB Version Date:  November 10, 2016   1.8 MV-NIS Translational Plans 
 
Based on the foregoing observations, we conclude that MV -NIS is a highly 
promising CD46 targeted oncolytic agent th at merits clinical testing in patients 
with multiple myeloma. Not only does the virus have an interesting and novel target specificity with associated single agent activity, but its biodistribution can 
also be non-invasively monitored in vivo  allowing clinical validation of its ability 
to interact with its known molecular target, CD46.  Furthermore, assuming that the expectation of myeloma targeting can be  confirmed in this clinical study, it 
will be possible to further boost the potency of MV-NIS by subsequent administration of 
131I.  Thus, MV-NIS offers the opportunity for rational clinical 
development.   
 
The risks associated with MV-NIS administration to this group of patients are 
considered to be acceptable.  Wher eas MV-NIS has not previously been 
administered to humans, there is a vast knowledge base concerning the toxic 
effects of closely related viruses in the human population.  Thus wild-type measles virus causes a well-described illn ess characterized by fever, rash, upper 
respiratory tract symptoms and transient immunosuppression [32].  The case 
fatality rate in the United States of Amer ica is 0.1 to 0.2 %, but is higher in 
underdeveloped countries where opportunistic infections secondary to measles 
immunosuppression are a more significant problem.  At the other end of the spectrum, live attenuated measles virus vacci nes have been used extensively.  In 
the USA alone, more than 550 million doses of measles vaccine have been distributed to date.  Several different members of the Edmonston virus lineage 
have been used for measles vaccination, and all of them are capable of causing a 
mild measles-like illness in some variable percentage of vaccinees [33-39].  It is therefore anticipated that some MV-NIS -treated patients may develop a measles-
like illness.  However, in the entire history of measles vaccination, no case of reversion of vaccine strain to wild-type measles has been documented, and only 6 
deaths have been reported due to uncontro lled spread of the vaccine strain virus 
in severely immune-compromised individuals.  In contrast to their effects in non-immune subjects, neither wild-type nor attenuated measles viruses cause a 
measles-like illness in patients previously exposed to the virus [40, 41]. 
 
Our longer-term strategy will be to develop and test new versions of MV-NIS 
that have been engineered to enhance or modify their target specificity.  For 
example, we anticipate that whereas the e fficacy of the current version of MV-
NIS will be due to its interaction with CD46, the dose limiting toxicity will be a 
measles-like illness due to its interacti on with SLAM.  Thus, a recombinant MV-
NIS in which the H protein has been modi fied to ablate its interaction with 
SLAM may have a better therapeutic ratio than the current version. 
 1.9 Post-protocol updates  
1.91  July 2011 
Improved Good Manufacturing Practice to  produce higher titers of MV-NIS 
Due to manufacturing limitations, our clinical studies to date have used a 
maximum dose of 10
9 TCID 50 MV-NIS, only three times higher than the 
minimum effective mouse dose.  Even at this low clinical dose we have shown 
that MV-NIS can traffic via the bloodstrea m to the tumor, infect the tumor cells, 
MC038C 16 MCCC Addendum 23 
IRB Version Date:  November 10, 2016   alkylator therapy, and immune modulator y drugs. Patients were also required to 
have negative measles titers both by EL ISA and by neutralizing anti-body assay. 
Due to a lack of major responses in th e first 11 treated, accrual was stopped, and 
the protocol was modified to include a different cohort of patients. It was felt that 
the safety profile seen to date made it reas onable to test the drug in less heavily 
pre-treated patients. 
 In the Phase II protocol, the first cohort will be referred to as cohort A and the 
second cohort as cohort B. The eligibilit y criteria for cohort B includes less 
heavily pretreated patients and the m easles titer eligibility was changed to 
include only the ELISA testing. 
 1.19a Hypotheses  
The primary hypothesis to be tested in  our initial phase I clinical trial is as 
follows:   
 1. MV-NIS administered intravenously  to patients with advanced multiple 
myeloma will selectively propagate in myeloma deposits throughout the body 
leading to tumor cell killing and reduction of tumor burden.   
 
  A secondary hypotheses is as follows:  
 
 2. Anti-measles virus antibodies (variable between patients) may sequester 
virus before it reaches the myeloma plas ma cells and will thereby interfere with 
tumor cell infection and killing.  Use of the immunosuppressant 
cyclophosphamide will abrogate this immune response. 
 
  An additional hypothesis that will be  tested in a future phase I trial is: 
 
 3. 131I administered at the appropriate  time will synergize with MV-NIS, 
leading to enhanced therapeutic response through destruction of uninfected 
myeloma cells adjacent to the infected cells.   
 
The reason that this hypothesis will not be  tested in the initial phase I clinical 
trial is to allow the independent evalua tion of MV-NIS toxicity, efficacy and 
kinetics without the additional confounding factor of 131I.

7.0 Protocol Treatment 
 
This study consists of two sequential dose escalation schemes to determine the maximum 
tolerated dose (MTD) of MV-NIS when give n with or without cyclophosphamide. These 
will be conducted in two separate stages. Fi rst, patients will be accrued to the various 
dose levels (based on the escalation rules be low) for MV-NIS alone. Once the MTD is 
determined for MV-NIS alone, then a second stage of dose escalation will occur to 
determine the MTD of MV-NIS when gi ven in combination with 10mg/kg of 
cyclophosphamide.  
 
7.11 Phase I, Stage 1: Evaluating MV-NIS Alone -Closed to accrual on December 
17, 2009. Reopened on October 13, 2011 for two more dose levels and Phase II expansion

in 250mL of normal saline under close observation in the Clinical 
Research Unit (CRU) or on Hematology in-patient service.  
  
7.122 Patients will be closely monitored in the CRU or Hematology in-patient 
service during infusion of the virus for acute febrile reaction to the intravenously administered virus. Patients who develop febrile or allergic responses to the infusion will be treated with acetaminophen (650 mg, 
PO), and diphenhydramine hydrochloride (50 mg IV or PO). For rigors, 
meperidine hydrochloride (50 mg IV) will be administered. Symptoms suggestive of anaphylaxis such as dyspnea, itching, dizziness or 
symptomatic hypotension will result in the abrupt cessation of the viral infusion and the start of aggressive supportive therapy with fluids, 
diphenhydramine, methylprednisone (1mg/kg IV) and epinephrine (1mg 
subcutaneously). Administration of these medications will be tracked.

7.213 The in vivo  distribution of MV-NIS and the kinetics of virus spread and 
elimination will be monitored as per section 7.113. 
 
7.22 MV-NIS Dose escalation (Stage 2)  The starting dose level of MV-NIS in the Stage 2 portion  (MV-NIS combined with cyclophosphamide) is the MTD as determined from the first stage 
evaluation of MV-NIS reduced by 2 log (i.e. 100-fold less). For example, if the 
MTD from the first stage evaluation for MV-NIS was 1 x 10
9, then the starting 
dose level of MV-NIS when given in combination with cyclophosphamide in this 
second stage of the trial will be 1 x 107.

**Dose Level 1 equals Stage 1 MTD/100 (If no DLTs were observed at any of 
the dose levels in Stage I, 109 will be used as the MTD since it would be the 
maximum dose delivered in Stage 1) 
† Escalation will not exceed the maximum tolerated dose from Stage I.  
7.3 MV-NIS Dose Escalation Rules (applicable to Phase I,  Stages 1 and 2)  7.31 If DLT is not seen in any of the 3 patients at a given dose level, then 3 additional 
patients will be treated at the next dose level. Dose escalation will not occur until 
full observation period (6 weeks) has elapsed  for the last patient within any given 
dose level cohort.  
7.32 If DLT is seen in 1 of 3 patients treated at a given dose level, 3 additional 
patients will be entered, one by one, at the same dose level. 
 
7.33 If no additional DLT is observed at that dose level then 3 additional patients will 
be treated at the next dose level. 
 
7.34 If 2 or more subjects out of 6 experience DLT at any dose level, MTD will have 
been exceeded. 
 
7.35 If MTD is exceeded at any dose level, the cohort at the next lower dose level will 
be expanded one by one as needed to reach a total of 6 participants. 
 
7.36 MTD will be defined as the highest dose at which no more than one out of six participants experiences DLT  OR no DLT observed out of 3 patients at the maximum dose level, provided no DLT is observed at any of the previous dose 
levels (see Section 7).  In the case that no DLTs are observed in any of the dose levels, then the MTD will be the maximum dose delivered.  
 
7.37 If no DLT is observed at the highest dose level (i.e. 1 x 10
9 for Stage 1 or 81 x 
107 for Stage 2), dose escalation beyond this dose level will not occur based on 
MV-NIS manufacturing limitations. If the 1 x 109 dose level (for stage 1) is 
reached without dose limiting toxicity, this dose--the maximum feasible dose--
will be used for further study.  
 
7.38 Stage 1 only: Once MTD or maximum feasible dose is reached in stage 1, 
this cohort will be expanded to treat a total of 37 patients at that level as 
part of a Phase II expansion.  
 
7.4 Dose De-escalation: Phase I, Stages 1 and 2:  
 
7.41 In the Phase I, stage 1 evaluation of MV-NIS alone, if two or more patients 
experience DLT at dose level 1, patients will be entered at a lower dose of 1x105 
(see Table in Section 7.12). If two or more patients experience DLT at this dose, further patients will be accrued at the dose level of 1x10
4 TCID 50/mL.  
 
7.42 In the Phase I, stage 2 evaluation of MV-NIS in combination with cyclophosphamide, if two or more patients experience DLT at the starting dose 
MC038C 29 MCCC Addendum 23

alone. Re-escalation will occur according to escalation rules described in 7.3 
except with this one log lower multiplier.

document elimination of the virus and virus infected cells 
 
7.55 Phase II stopping rule definitions are described in section 16.521 using DLT  
 
7.6 Toxicity Observation Period: The first 6 weeks after therapy will be considered the 
toxicity observation period, where any DLTs observed in this timeframe will determine 
whether or not accrual can continue to the next dose level. The toxicity observation 
period will be waved for the Phase II expansion. 
 7.7 Phase I only: If a patient fails to complete the initial course of therapy (i.e. registers,   but 
does not receive therapy or lost to follow-up during first 6 weeks), the patient will be regarded as inevaluable and an additional patient  will be treated at the current dose level.  
For these instances, a specific notation will be made for review by the Cancer Center Clinical Research Administrative Subcommittee (CCCRAS). If more than one participant must be replaced at a dose level for reasons other than toxicity, the reasons will be reported to the FDA and the trial be volun tarily halted pending comments by the FDA 
review team.

The disease is self-limiting in normal a dults but because myeloma patients are 
immunocompromised, treatment  will be implemented: 
 If the symptoms (including temperature > 38.5
o C) persist for as long as 6 days, 
or earlier at the treating physician’s discretion.  
 Earlier treatment is strongly recommended if a typical measles exanthem 
appears.  
 
Treatment will include immunoglobulin (500 mg /kg) and Ribavirin (10 mg/kg/day in 4 
divided doses orally or 20mg/kg/day intravenously) [47, 48]. Administration of these 
medications will be tracked and a participant with persistent measles-like illness will be classified as having experienced a DLT (see s ection 7.8). Additional ancillary support is

 8.0 Dosage Modification Based on Adverse Events  
8.1 Given the nature of this study (i.e. a phase I trial and a phase II study with only one dose 
of drug administered), there are no dose modifications in this study.   
 
9.0 Ancillary Therapy 
 9.1 Patients should receive full supportive car e during the study including blood products, 
antibiotics and treatment of concurrent me dical conditions and other newly diagnosed 
diseases.  
 
9.2 Patients will be closely monitored as an in -patient during infusion of the virus acute 
febrile reaction to the intravenously administered virus. For phase II, patients will be pre-
medicated with acetaminophen. Patients who de velop febrile or allergic responses to the 
infusion will be treated with acetaminophen (650 mg, PO) and diphenhydramine 
hydrochloride (50mg IV or PO). For rigors, meperidine hydrochloride (50 mg IV) will be 
administered. Symptoms suggestive of anaphy laxis such as dyspnea, itching, dizziness or 
symptomatic hypotension will result in the ab rupt cessation of the viral infusion and the 
start of aggressive supportive therapy with fluids, diphenhydramine, methylprednisone 
(1mg/kg IV) and epinephrine (1mg subcutaneously). Administration of these medications will be tracked. 
 9.3 Patients will be educated about the symptoms of measles (coryza, malaise, fever, rash, lymphadenopathy and transient suppression of the immune system
28,29 ) and asked to 
report immediately if any of these symptoms develop.  
 
The incubation period of measles (rubeola) av erages 10 to 12 days from exposure to 
prodrome and 14 days from exposure to rash (range, 7 to 18 days). Prodromal symptoms of severe, brassy cough; coryza; conjunctivitis ; photophobia; and fever appear 3 to 4 days 
before the exanthem and increase daily in  severity. The nose and eyes run continuously. 
Koplik's spots (blue-white spots with a red halo) appear on the buccal mucous membrane 
opposite the premolar teeth 24 to 48 hours be fore the exanthem and remain for 2 to 4 
days. 
 
The rash begins on the fourth or fifth day on the face and behind the ears, but in 24 to 36 
hours, it spreads to the trunk and extremities. It reaches maximum intensity simultaneously in all areas in approximately 3 days and fades after 5 to 10 days. The rash consists of slightly elevated maculopapules that vary in size from 0.1 to 1.0 cm and vary in color from dark red to a purplish hue. They are frequently confluent on both the face 
MC038C 33 MCCC Addendum 23 
IRB Version Date:  November 10, 2016   and body, a feature that is such a distinct characteristic of measles that eruptions of 
similar appearance in other diseases are termed morbilliform. The early rash blanches on pressure; the fading rash is yellowish-brown with a fine scale, and it does not blanch.  
 The disease is self-limiting in normal adults but myeloma patients are immunocompromised, treatment will be impl emented if the symptoms (including 
temperature > 38.5
o C) persist for as long as 6 days, and earlier at the treating physician’s 
discretion. Earlier treatment is strongly recommended if a typical measles exanthem appears. Treatment will include intravenous  gammaglobulin (500 mg/kg) and Ribavirin 
(10 mg/kg/day in 4 divided doses orally or 20mg/kg/day intravenously) [47, 48]. Administration of these medications will be tracked and a participant with persistent measles-like illness will be classified as having experienced a DLT (see section 7.7) 
9.4 Patients who demonstrate persistent viremia or viral shedding (10-fold increase in MV-
NIS genome/mcg RNA at 4 weeks) that is confirmed on 2 consecutive samples after day 
15 will also be treated with measles immunoglobulin and Ribavirin. 
 
9.5 The disease is spread by respiratory droplets and can be communicated from slightly before the beginning of the prodromal period to 4 days after appearance of the rash; communicability is minimal after the second day of the rash. Though we would not 
expect the virus to be contagious to others since the majority of the U.S. population is 
vaccinated and all Mayo Clinic staff have  measles virus immunity documented upon 
commencement of employment, we will require that health care personnel wear a mask at 
the first sign of cough; coryza; conjunctivitis; photophobia; or fever in the patient.  
 
The vaccine strain of the measles virus (o f which MV-NIS is a derivative) has been 
shown to be shed in the urine of normal ch ildren undergoing routine vaccination. Despite 
the presence of viral shedding of the vaccine st rain of measles virus, transmission of has 
not been documented. However, since other patients on the Mayo Clinic grounds may be 
severely immunosuppressed, we will require th at MV-NIS treated patients wear a mask 
when outside of their hospital room on Mayo Clinic grounds while they are shedding 
virus (tested by RT-qPCR). 
 If a patient is found to be shedding the virus in urine or throat gargle specimens(s), family members (or close personal contacts) who do n’t have documentation of immunity, will 
be offered testing to assess anti-measles virus immunity by Enzyme Immunoassay for the presence of MV-NIS. Measles vaccination will be  offered to seronega tive individuals, as 
per standard clinical practice.   
9.6 Patients enrolled in this study will not be elig ible for concurrent enrollment in any other 
study involving a pharmacological agent (drugs, biologicals, immunotherapy, gene therapy) whether for therapeutic  intent or symptom control. 
 
10.0 Adverse Event (AE) Reporting and Monitoring  
 
10.1 This study will utilize the Common Terminol ogy Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) 
v3.0 for adverse event monitoring and reporting.  The CTC v3.0 can be downloaded from the CTEP home page ( http://ctep.info.nih.gov/CTC3/ctc ind term.htm) .  All appropriate 
treatment areas should have access to a copy of the CTCAE v3.0. 
 
10.11 Adverse event monitoring and reporting is a routine part of every clinical trial.  
First, identify and grade the severity of  the event using the CTCAE.  Next, 
MC038C 34 MCCC Addendum 23 
IRB Version Date:  November 10, 2016   determine whether the event is expected  or unexpected (refer to Section 15.0 
and/or product literature) and if the ad verse event is related to the medical 
treatment or procedure (see Section 10.13).  With this information, determine 
whether an adverse event should be repor ted as an expedited report (see Section 
10.2) or as part of the routinely reported clinical data. 
 Expedited adverse event reporting requires submission of a written report, but may also involve telephone notifications.  Telephone and written reports are to be 
completed within the timeframes specifi ed in Section 10.2.  All expedited 
adverse event reports should also be su bmitted to the local Institutional Review 
Board (IRB).   
 10.12 Assessment of Attribution 
 
When assessing whether an adverse event is related to a medical treatment or procedure, the following attribution categories are utilized:  Definite - The adverse event is clearly related to the investigational agent(s). 
Probable - The adverse event is likely related to the investigational agent(s). 
Possible - The adverse event may be related to the investigational agent(s). 
Unlikely - The adverse event is doubtfully related to the investigational agent(s). Unrelated - The adverse event is clearly NOT related to the investigational 
agent(s)  
10.13 Expected vs. Unexpected 
 The determination of whether an AE is  expected is based on agent-specific 
adverse event information provided in  Section 15.0 of the protocol.  
 Unexpected AEs are those not listed in  the agent-specific adverse event 
information provided in Section 15.0 of the protocol. 
 
10.14 When a study includes both investigatio nal and commercial agents, the following 
apply: 
 When an investigational agent(s) is used in combination with a commercial 
agent(s) the combination is considered  investigational. Expedited reporting 
of adverse events follows the guide lines for investigational agents.

11.0 Treatment Evaluation  
11.1 Terms and definitions 
 
 M-protein: synonyms include M-spike, monoclonal protein and myeloma protein, 
paraprotein, M-component. 
 
Serum M-protein level is quantitated using densitometry on SPEP except in cases 
where the SPEP is felt to be unreliable.   
 M-proteins migrating in the -region (usually IgA M-proteins)  
 Cases in which the M-spike is so large and narrow on agarose (some 
specimens >4 g/dL) that they underestimate the actual immunoglobulin level (by greater than 1500 mg/dL) due to technical staining properties of the 
agarose gel. 
 Cases in which there are multiple peaks of same monoclonal protein 
(aggregates or dimers) 
 
If SPEP is not available or felt to be unr eliable (above examples) for routine M-
protein quantitation, then quantitative immunoglobulin levels derived from 
nephelometry or turbidometry can be accepte d.  However, this must be explicitly 
reported at baseline, and only nephelometr y can be used for that patient to assess 
response. SPEP derived M-spike values and quantitative nephelometric 
immunoglobulin values cannot be used interchangeably.   
 
Urine M-protein measurement is estimated using 24-h UPEP only.  Random or 24 h 
urine tests measuring kappa and lambda light chain levels are not reliable and are not 
recommended. 
 
FLC estimation is currently carried out using the serum FLC assay (Freelite, The 
Binding Site Limited, UK).  Patients with kappa/lambda FLC ratio <0.26 are defined 
as having monoclonal lambda FLC and those with ratios >1.65 as having a 
monoclonal kappa FLC.  The monoclonal li ght chain isotype is considered the 
involved FLC isotype, and the opposite light chain type as the uninvolved FLC type.  
 
 Response terms:  The following response terms will be used: stringent Complete 
Response (sCR), complete response (CR), ve ry good partial response (VGPR), partial 
response (PR), Minimal Response (MR), stable disease (SD), progressive disease (PD) and relapse from CR (RFCR).  
 
In addition, for each response category, there will be an “unconfirmed” response 
category, which will be for internal use, for the purpose of guiding decision making and test ordering. These designations will app lied at the time of the first measurement 
at which the quantitative aspect of the response category has been satisfied without 
MC038C 38 MCCC Addendum 23 
IRB Version Date:  November 10, 2016   the confirmation step having been satis fied. The designation “u” will precede the 
standard abbreviations, and will include usCR, uCR, uVGPR, uPR, uMR, uPD.  
 
Measurable disease: Patients who have a measurable serum or urine M-protein.  
 
 Serum M-protein ≥1 g/dl  
 Urine M-protein ≥  200 mg/24 h 
 Serum FLC assay: Involved FLC level ≥  10 mg/dl provided serum FLC ratio is 
abnormal 
 Bone marrow plasma cells ≥  30% 
 
The serum free light chain (FLC) assay is of particular use in monitoring response to therapy in patients who have oligo-secretory or non-secretory disease and  should be used 
in assessing response only if the baseline serum and/or urine M proteins are not 
“measurable” as above, and the baseline le vel of the involved FLC is ”measurable.”  
When using this assay, it is important to note th at the FLC levels vary considerably with 
changes in renal function and in patients with renal insufficiency, the levels of both the 
kappa and lambda may remain elevated, but the ratio normalizes with achievement of 
CR. Thus both the level of the involved and the uninvolved FLC isotype (i.e., the 
involved/uninvolved ratio or involved-uninvol ved difference) should be considered in 
assessing response. Patients included on the study on the basis of FLC  alone (i.e. no 
measurable serum/urine) should be the only ones who are evaluated using FLC 
response criteria. The others should follo w usual criteria and ignore FLC results.  
 
 Evaluable disease : Patients who do not have a “measurable” serum M-spike, serum 
free light chain, or urine M-spike. 
 
 Oligosecretory myeloma:  Patient with multiple myeloma who has NEVER had 
“measurable” serum M-spike or urine M-spike, but has had a detectable monoclonal 
protein in his/her serum and/or urine and/or measurable serum free light chain.  
 
 Non-secretory myeloma:  Patient with multiple myeloma who has NEVER had a 
detectable monoclonal protein in his/her serum and/or urine.

1 Immunofixation studies of both serum and urine are required to document CR 
regardless of registration values, and in addition FLC  measurement and bone marrow 
immunophenotyping is required to document sCR. 
 
2 For serum measurable patients, 24 hour urin e does not need to be confirmed (i.e. 
repeated after documented response) for any response category 
  
3 Bone marrow biopsyresults do not need to be confirmed (i.e. repeated after documented 
response).  
 
11.3 Confirmed response  
 
In order to be classified as a hematologic response, confirmation of serum monoclonal protein, serum immunoglobulin free light chain (when primary determinant of response) 
and urine monoclonal protein (when primary de terminant of response) results must be 
made by verification on two consecutive determinations.   
 Bone marrow aspirate and biopsy are only required to document or confirm CR 
or sCR, except for patients with evaluable disease only, where a bone marrow is 
required to document all response categories including progression. However, a 
second confirmatory bone marrow is not required to confirm response. 
 Radiographic studies are not required to satisfy these response requirements, however, if radiographic studies were perfo rmed there should be no evidence of 
progressive or new bone lesions. 
 
Appropriate tests required to document and confirm response are listed in Table 11.2 
 
11.4 Bone progression  
 
Caution must be exercised to avoid rating pr ogression or relapse on the basis of variation 
of radiologic technique alone.  Compressi on fracture does not exclude continued response 
and may not indicate progression.  When progr ession is based on skeletal disease alone, it 
should be discussed with the study chair befo re removing the patient from the study.  
 
11.5 Response and Progression 
 
Criteria for response and progression are listed in Table 11.2. Progressive disease for all 
patients as defined in Table 11.2. Although the definition for “relapse from CR (or sCR) is listed, this will be documented as a response category in ONLY those protocols 
evaluating disease free survival.

 Appearance of any other sign of progression (i.e., new plasmacytoma, lytic bone lesion, or hypercalcemia) 
a All response categories require two consecutive assessments made at anytime before the 
institution of any new therapy; complete and PR, MR and SD categories also require no known 
evidence of progressive or new bone lesions if radiographic studies were performed. 
Radiographic studies are not required to satisfy these response requi rements. Bone marrow 
assessments need not be confirmed. Each category,  except for stable disease, will have a working 
subcategory of “unconfirmed” [prefix ‘u”] to designate first time point at which response 
category MAY have been achieved if confirmed. 
b Presence/absence of clonal cells is based upon the k/  ratio. An abnormal k/  ratio by 
immunohistochemistry and/or immunofluorescence requires a minimum of 100 plasma cells for 
analysis. An abnormal ratio reflecting presence of an abnormal clone is k/  of >4:1 or <1;2.  
c  Positive immunofixation alone in  a patient previously classified as CR will not be considered 
progression. 
d This category will ONLY be used on a protocol sp ecific basis, i.e. only  those protocols looking 
at disease free survival. 
e This response category is not available for those patients being followed by bone marrow only. 
f Relapse from CR has the 5% cutoff versus 10% for other categories of relapse.  
11.6 Criteria for engraftment (for hematopoietic stem cell transplant studies only) 
 
Engraftment is defined as:

IRB Version Date:  November 10, 2016   13.0 Treatment/Follow-up Decision at Evaluation of Patient 
 
13.1 The investigator may discontinue individual patients from the study at any time for the 
following reasons: a) if the patient develops adverse events that in the judgment of the investigator preclude further exposure to the study agent; b) if a patient develops an intercurrent illness that is not consistent with the protocol requirements, that patient may be withdrawn from the study; c) if the patient is not compliant with the study plan. 
 13.2 Phase I only: Indications for replacing a patient include: a) If a patient fails to complete 
the initial course of therapy (defined as 1 cycle of drug administration and 6 weeks observation) for reasons other than toxicity (e.g. intercurrent illness, patient refusal, or patient non-compliance), the patient will be regarded as inevaluable and an additional 
patient will be treated at the current dose level (see Section 7.6). If more than one participant must be replaced at a dose level for reasons other than toxicity, the reasons 
will be reported to the FDA and the trial be voluntarily halted pending comments by the 
FDA review team. 
 13.3 Patients who have disease progression, refuse further observation, or go on to receive 
alternate therapy will be monitored  by Q-RT -PCR for N-gene according to test schedule 
until Q-RT-PCR becomes negative. This can be done through mail-in kits.    
 13.4 Patients who discontinue treatment due to unacceptable toxicity as defined in Section 7 
will be actively monitored in Observation and will follow the test schedule per Section 
4.0 until progression and until Q-RT-PCR for N- gene becomes negative. This will be 
done according to test schedule and can be  accomplished through mail-in kits.     
 13.5 If a patient is registered to this trial a nd refuses further participation prior to receiving 
treatment (and is classified as a cancel), it is not necessary to provide follow-up information.  On-study material is to be submitted.  No further follow-up information is 
necessary.  
 13.6 For the purposes of this study, patients will be evaluated for clinical response at 6 weeks 
and 12 weeks and every 3 months thereafter  while on observation. Blood, urine, bone 
marrow and skeletal radiography will be performed as outlined in Section 4.0. 
 
MC038C 44 MCCC Addendum 23 
IRB Version Date:  November 10, 2016   14.0 Pharmacologic/Ancillary studies (Mandatory) and Optional Biopsy 
 
14.1 Assessment of viremia and viral shedding. Mononuclear cells will be isolated from blood, 
throat washings and urine from all study pa tients on days 3, 8, 15. Additional samples on 
days 22 and 29 might be collected (dependi ng on the viral RNA profile) and all will be 
tested for a) viral replication (quantitativ e RT-PCR to determine virus RNA copy number 
and co-culture on Vero cells for virus isola tion). Testing will be performed in Dr S.J. 
Russell’s laboratory (Guggenheim 1802) under th e supervision of Dr Dispenzieri.  
 
If a patient is found to be shedding the virus in urine or throat gargle specimens(s), family 
members (or close personal contacts) who do n’t have documentation of immunity, will 
be offered testing to assess anti-measles virus immunity by Enzyme Immunoassay for the presence of MV-NIS. Measles vaccination will be  offered to seronega tive individuals, as 
per standard clinical practice.  
 14.2 Assessment of immune competence will be  performed by evaluation of immunoglobulin 
levels, CD4 and CD8 counts  
 14.3 Assessment of the peripheral immune re sponse to viral administration. MV specific 
immunity will be evaluated at baseline and on day 42 by (a) measuring anti MV specific antibodies (IgG) and (b) by performing lymphocyte proliferation assays, and IFN-g ELISPOT assays on peripheral blood. These latte r tests will also be performed on day 8 
and day 15; and (c) cytokine levels around the time of MV-NIS administration.   
 14.4 Appraisal of baseline bone marrow CD46 and SLAM expression by flow cytometry. 
 
14.5 Assessment of baseline bone marrow’s infectivity ex vivo.  14.6 Assessment of day 42 bone marrow syncytia  formation and levels of measles virus N 
mRNA within bone marrow cells. 
 14.7 Evaluation of MV-NIS biodistribution using SPECT/CT.  Table 4.1. 
 14.8 Pharmacokinetic studies will be done during St age 2 and Stage 1 patients at dose levels 5 
and 6 of trial on all patients as well as all Phase II patients 
 
14.9 Optional biopsy of area of interest will be performed by Dr. Stephanie Carlson (or colleagues) to biopsy “area of interest” if uptake seen on SPECT scan day 8 to confirm presence of virus in lesion.  The biopsy of the lesion will be done per usual image-guided 
techniques using CT-guidance (see Section 17).

MC038C 46 MCCC Addendum 23 
IRB Version Date:  November 10, 2016   15.0 Drug Information  
 
15.1 MV-NIS (recombinant Edmonston measles virus carrying the human NIS gene)  
 
15.11 Background:  MV-NIS is an attenuated measles virus, engineered to express the 
human thyroidal sodium-iodide symporter (NIS).  The virus is selectively oncolytic, targeting and destroying tu mor cells through CD46, a membrane 
regulator of complement activation that  is known to be overexpressed on human 
malignancies.  Multiple myeloma cells are selectively infected and killed by 
attenuated measles viruses of the Edmonston vaccine lineage  
 
15.12 Formulation: MV-NIS infusions yield doses ranging from 1 x 10
4, 1 x 105, 1 x 
106, 1 x 107, 1 x 108, 1 x 109, to 1 x 1011 TCID 50.  See Section 1.91 for a more 
complete description of the production and purification process 
 15.13 Administration: The virus will be administered by slow intravenous (IV) infusion 
(1 hour) in 250ml of normal saline under close observation in the Clinical Research Unit (CRU) or on the Hematology in-patient service.  (See Appendix I) 
 
15.14 Known potential toxicities: MV-NIS has not been tested in the clinic and 
therefore, we do not know the potentia l toxicities. However, the virus was 
rescued from a derivative of the Edmonston B vaccine strain of measles virus and we anticipate that the most common toxicities will be similar to those experienced after the administration of the measles vaccine [44]. The main reaction associated with measles vaccination is a mild measles-like syndrome 
that occurs in 2-3% of recipients usua lly 1 week after vaccination. Thus patients 
might experience moderate fever up to 39.4 C and rash (minimal) within the first 
5 to 12 days after virus injection. However it should be noted that this vaccine 
related measles like illness has been described only in measles-naïve subjects. 
 
Not uncommon reactions: 
 Moderate to high fever lasting 1 – 2 da ys, starting within a week or two of 
vaccination 
 A rash, lasting 1 – 2 days 
 Cough and rhinitis 
 Erythema multiforme 
 Arthritis 
 
Unexpected and rare reactions associated with the vaccine: 
 Allergic reactions including anaphylaxis 
 Reactions at the injection site such as a wheal, flare or urticaria 
 Thrombocytopenia 
 Diarrhea 
 Giant cell pneumonia 
 Inclusion body encephalitis 
 Guillain-Barré syndrome 
 Vasculitis  
 Otitis media  
 Optic neuritis  
 Ataxia
  
MC038C 47 MCCC Addendum 23 
IRB Version Date:  November 10, 2016    
We will be particularly vigilant for sy mptoms suggestive of either giant cell 
pneumonia or inclusion body encephalitis that have been rarely observed in 
immunocompromised patients who were administered the vaccine. 43 If 
symptoms suggestive of persistent meas les or either pneumonitis or encephalitis 
develop, the patients will be treated aggressively with anti-measles virus immune globulin and ribavirin and all the supportive care necessary as the situation might dictate.
42 
 
15.15 Risks to caretakers and other Mayo Clinic Patients 
Viral transmission between patient and his/ her contacts is thought to be unlikely, 
unless the patient develops florid measles infection. The vaccine strain of the measles virus (of which MV-NIS is a derivative) has been shown to be shed in the urine of normal children undergoi ng routine vaccination. Despite the 
presence of viral shedding of the vaccine st rain of measles virus, there has been 
only 1 case of symptomatic measles virus presumptively transmitted from a vaccinated individual (Rota et al J. Clin Microbiology 2005). However, since other patients on the Mayo Clinic grounds may be severely immunosuppressed, we will require that MV-NIS treated patients wear a mask when outside of their 
hospital room on Mayo Clinic grounds while they are shedding virus (tested by 
RT-qPCR).  
 
15.2 Radioactive technetium –99m-Tc   
 
15.21 Generic or Common Drug Name (others such as Brand, Alpha-numeric): Sodium 
Pertechnetate Tc 99m, Mo-99/Tc-99m generator, TechneLite® (Technetium Tc 
99m Generator), Ultra-Tec hneKow™ DTE Generator.  
 
15.22 Background: Mechanism of action, drug family. 
 
The pertechnetate ion distributes in the body similarly to the iodide ion but is not organified when trapped in the thyroid gland. Pertechnetate concentrates in the 
thyroid gland, salivary glands, stomach and choroid plexus. After intravenous administration it gradually equilibrates with  the extracellular space. A fraction is 
promptly excreted via the kidneys. 
 
15.23 Formulation: How supplied, available strengths, excipients. 
 
Supplied in a Mo-99/Tc-99m generator which contains the amount of 
molybdenum Mo-99 at the date and time of calibration stated on the label. 
 The sterile, non-pyrogenic solution used to elute the generator column contains 0.9% sodium chloride. The eluant does not contain an antimicrobial agent.  The generator should not be used after the expiration date stated on the label. The expiration time of the Sodium Pertechnetate  Tc 99m solution is not later than 12 
hours after time of elution. If the eluate is used to reconstitute a kit, the radiolabeled kit should not be used after 12 hours from the time of generator elution or after the expiration time stated on the labeling for the prepared drug, whichever is earlier. (BUD assignment for prepared drug is based on radiopharmaceutical package insert or internal validated SOPs)

 16.0 Statistical Considerations and Methodology 
 
16.1 Overview: This is a Phase I/II study designed to  evaluate the toxicity and efficacy of 
MV-NIS.  The phase I portion will determine in a sequential manner the MTD of MV-
NIS when administered with or without cyclophosphamide. This will be done in two 
stages (MV-NIS alone and then MV-NIS with cyclophosphamide), where each evaluation will use the standard ‘cohort of three’ design used in phase I clinical trials.  Toxicity and pharmacokinetics (viral spread, expression and elimination) of MV-NIS in 
the treatment of multiple myeloma will be evaluated in each of the stages.  Once the 
MTD has been determined in Stage 1, the phase II portion will assess the efficacy of MV-
NIS alone in 2 cohorts (Cohort A: relapsed  or refractory multiple myeloma who have 
exhausted all therapeutic opti ons and Cohort B:  relapsing from VGPR or CR and have 
not received myeloma directed therapy for at least 12 weeks).  The same one-stage design with an interim analysis will be used to ev aluate efficacy in each cohort independently.  
 16.11 Sample Size, Accrual and Study Duration for Phase I: The first stage of this study 
(MV-NIS alone) may involve as few as 9 patients (DLTs in at least 2 patients observed in first three patients at the starting dose level and 6 at dose level -1 if deemed MTD) and as many as 24 patients (6 each at dose levels 1 through 4).  
 
ADDENDUM 10: The number of patients needed  for Stage 1, is recalculated based on 
the knowledge that only 12 patients were required for dose levels 1-4 since not DLT 
observed; Re-opening Stage 1 for dose leve ls 5 and 6 (new manufacturing capabilities) 
MC038C 53 MCCC Addendum 23 
IRB Version Date:  November 10, 2016   could require 6-12 patients depending on whether dose-limiting toxicity is seen at this 
level. 
 
The second stage of the Phase I  study (MV-NIS with 1 dose of cyclophosphamide) may 
involve as few as 3 patients (DLTs in at least 2 of the first 3 patients at the starting dose level and decision not to de-escalate) and as many as 30 (6 per dose level).  
 
ADDENDUM 10: The number of patients needed  for Stage 2, is recalculated based on 
the knowledge that for Stage 2, dose levels 1 and 2 required only 6 patients since no DLT 
observed at these levels. With the revised dose-escalation scheme of 10-fold rather than 
3-fold increases per dose level, there would be  a total of six Stage 2 dose levels, for a 
minimum and maximum number of patients on Stage 2 of 18 and 30, respectively, 
assuming Stage 1 maximum tolerated dose is equivalent to maximum feasible dose. If 
not, the Stage 2 patient numbers would drop to a minimum of 12 and a maximum of 18 
patients. 
 
At trial inception, the overall the minimum nu mber of patients to be enrolled was 12 and 
the maximum number of patients was 54.  Af ter Amendment 10, the revised estimates of 
overall minimum and maximum are 30 and 54. For Stages 1 and 2, the accrual rate for 
this study is expected to be about 3 patie nts per month. Assuming each patient cohort will 
require approximately 5 weeks to follow for dose-limiting toxicity after the last patient 
has been accrued (see Section 7.5), each cohort of 3 patients in Stage 1 or 2 will require about 2 months for accrual, treatment, and ob servation to determine incidence of DLTs 
and whether or not dose escalation can proceed.  
 
Therefore, the accrual period for Phase I is expected to be at most 72 months, taking into account the time needed to assess toxicity in each cohort.  
 
ADDENDUM 17:  As of June 16, 2014, 32 patients had been accrued to Phase I. With the interesting responses seen in Stage I, dose level 6, Stage II (escalation with addition 
of cyclophosphamide) was suspe nded to move to a Phase II single agent MV-NIS trial.  
A minimum of 12 and a maximum of 37 evaluable patients will be accrued in phase II. We anticipate accruing 4 additio nal patients to account for
 ineligibility, cancellation, 
major treatment violation, or other reasons.  Therefore, we expect to accrue a maximum of 41 additional patients for 73 patients overall.   The expectation is to start accruing 
patients in August 2014 at a rate of 4 per m onth, with an anticipated accrual time of 10 
months for the Phase II trial.
 The phase II analysis can begin after the last patient accrued 
has been followed for 3 months  ADDENDUM 21:  As of March 2015, 44 patients have been accrued to this study (32 phase I and 12 phase II cohort A).  Due to l ack of major responses seen in phase II cohort 
A, accrual to cohort A will be suspended.  C ohort B will be added to evaluate the efficacy 
of this regimen in less heavily pretreated patients.  A minimum of 12 and a maximum of 37 additional evaluable patients will be accrue d to cohort B in phase II. We anticipate 
accruing 4 additional patients to account for in eligibility, cancellation, major treatment 
violation, or other reasons.  Therefore, we expect to accrue a maximum of 41 additional patients in cohort B for 85 patients overall.   The expectation is to start accruing patients 
at a rate of 2 patients per month once Addendum  21 is implemented, with an anticipated 
accrual time of 20 months for cohort B of the Phase II trial. The phase II analysis can begin after the last patient accrued has been followed for 3 months 
 
MC038C 54 MCCC Addendum 23 
IRB Version Date:  November 10, 2016   16.12 General Statistical Considerations: The trial is designed to provide data about 
pharmacokinetics (biodistribution, targe ting, viral gene expression and viral 
elimination), safety and biological activity of  MV-NIS in patients with myeloma. Data 
related to toxicity and pharmacology will be presented using descriptive statistics due to 
the exploratory nature of the study. The data will be presented in table formats listing the mean, standard deviation and number of patients per group for continuous data, or listing count and percentages for categorical data as appropriate. All the relevant data 
will be used both in exploratory and hypoth esis generating fashions to examine factors 
related to toxicity and pharmacology. 
 16.2 Phase I Portion 
 
16.21 Primary outcome analyses: Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD): The MTD will be 
defined as the highest safely-tolerated dose le vel where at most one patient out of six 
experiences DLT or no DLT observed out of 3 patients at the maximum dose level, provided no DLT is observed at any of the prev ious dose levels (see Section 7).  In the 
case that no DLTs are observed in any of th e dose levels, then the MTD will be the 
maximum dose delivered for each stage. MTD determination: See Section 7.0  
16.22 Secondary endpoints: The following secondary endpoints will be evaluated for 
each stage independently. In addition, diffe rences in dose levels with and without 
cyclophosphamide may also be explored where appropriate.  
 
16.221 The number and severity of toxicity incidents will indicate the level of     myeloma. For each of the stages, non-hematologic toxicities will be evaluated via 
the CTCAE v. 3 standard toxicity gradin g. Hematologic toxicity measures such 
as anemia, neutropenia and thrombocytop enia will be assessed using continuous 
variables as the outcome measures (nadir and percent change from baseline 
values) as well as categorization via CTCAE v. 3 standard toxicity grading. Frequency distributions and other descrip tive measures will form the basis of the 
analysis of these variables  16.222 Clinical Response: The number of clinical responses may provide useful 
preliminary data on the efficacy of this  treatment regimen in this patient 
population. A clinical response in this setting will be defined as noted in Section 11.0. The number of responses (CR, VGPR, PR, or MR) will be summarized by 
simple descriptive summary statistics across all patients in each group as well as 
by dose level.   16.223 Tolerability of this regimen will be explored in an ancillary manner 
through time-related variables including tim e until any treatment related toxicity, 
time until treatment related grade 3+ toxicity and time until hematologic nadirs (WBC, ANC, platelets). Simple summary statistics will be supplemented with Kaplan-Meier survival estimates and related confidence intervals. The effect of dose and ancillary dichotomized covariat es such as age will be explored using 
logrank testing involving one covariate at a time. Again the small sample size restricts the generalizability of such testing, but the results will provide 
preliminary indications for subsequent research in Phase II clinical trials.  
  
MC038C 55 MCCC Addendum 23 
IRB Version Date:  November 10, 2016   16.23 Correlative Analyses 
16.231 Data will be collected for a numbe r of laboratory correlative variables as 
discussed before (e.g. viral replication and shedding). Descriptive 
statistics and scatterplots will form the basis of presentation of these variables. Correlations between the laboratory values and other outcome 
measures will be carried out by sta ndard parametric and non-parametric 
tests (e.g. Pearson’s and Spearman’s rho). Data obtained from gamma 
camera imaging of MV-NIS following 
123I consumption (or after revised 
protocol 99m-Tc administration) will be used to determine the bio-distribution and kinetics of virus spread and NIS gene expression in vivo 
and correlate it with tumor distribution. We will also estimate the 
radiation dose that could be delivered to the bone marrow as well as critical organs such as the liver, lungs and kidneys if I-131 were to be administered using MIRDOSE 3 progr am. Where patterns of correlation 
are indicated, ordinary and partial correlation coefficients (controlling for dose levels) will be calculated. Inferential testing for significant shifts in 
the correlative laboratory data results across dose levels will be carried 
out only as a hypothesis generating exercise. 
 
16.3 Phase II Portion (to be evaluated in each cohort independently) 
 
16.31 Statistical Design: 
 
16.311 Decision Rule:  The largest success proportion where the proposed 
treatment regimen would be considered  ineffective in this population is 
5%, representing a response by chance alone. The smallest success proportion that would warrant subsequent studies with the proposed regimen in this patient populati on is 20%. The following one-stage 
design with an interim analysis is based on a Simon optimal design and uses 12 or 37 patients to test the null hypothesis that the true success 
proportion in a given patient population is at most 5%.  
16.3111 Interim Analysis:  Enter 12 patients into the study. If no 
successes are observed in the first 12 evaluable patients, we 
will consider this regimen ineff ective in this patient population 
and terminate this study. Otherwise, if the number of successes 
is at least 1, we will continue accrual. 
 16.3112 Final Decision Rule:  Enter an additional 25 patients into the 
study. If 3 or fewer successes are observed in the first 37 evaluable patients, we will consider this regimen ineffective in this patient population. If 4 or more successes are observed in the first 37 evaluable patients, we may recommend further testing of this regimen in subsequent studies in this population. 
 
16.3113 Over Accrual: If more than the target number of patients are 
accrued, the additional patients w ill not be used to evaluate the 
stopping rule or used in any decision making process.  
MC038C 56 MCCC Addendum 23 
IRB Version Date:  November 10, 2016   Analyses involving over accrued patients are discussed in 
Section 16.413. 
 
16.3114 NOTE: We will not suspend accrual at the interim analysis to 
allow the first 12 patients to become evaluable, unless undue 
toxicity is observed. Given the limited overall sample size and the inclusion of an adverse events stopping rule, we feel it is ethical to not halt accrual for the interim analysis. However, if accrual is extremely rapid, we may temporarily suspend 
accrual in order to obtain safety data on these patients before 
re-opening accrual to further patients. 
 
16.312 Power and Significance Level:  Assuming that the number of successes 
is binomially distributed, the significance level is .10, i.e. there is a 10% 
chance of finding the drug to be effective when it truly is not.  The 
probability of declaring that this regimen warrants further study (i.e. statistical power) and the probability of stopping after the interim analysis under various success proportio ns can be tabulated as a function 
of the true success proportion as shown in the following table. 
 
If the true success proportion is... 0.05 0.10 0.15 0.20 0.25 
Then the probability of declaring that the regimen warrants further 
study is… 0.10 0.45 0.75 0.90 0.96 
And the probability of stopping after the interim analysis is… 0.54 0.28 0.14 0.07 0.03 
 
16.313 Other considerations:  Adverse ev ents, quality/duration of response, and 
patterns of treatment failure observed in this study, as well as scientific 
discoveries or changes in standard car e will be taken into account in any 
decision to terminate the study 
 16.4 Analysis Plan for Phase II Portion (to be evaluated in each cohort independently) 
 
16.41 Primary Outcome Analyses: 
 
16.411 Definition:  The primary endpoint in the phase II portion of this trial is 
the proportion of confirmed response.  A confirmed response is defined as a PR or better noted as the objective status on two consecutive 
evaluations.  Confirmed response will be evaluated using all cycles.  All patients meeting the eligibility criteria who have signed a consent form and have begun treatment will be evaluable for confirmed response. 
 
16.412 Estimation:  The proportion of successes will be estimated by the number 
of successes divided by the total number of evaluable patients Ninety-five percent confidence intervals for the true success proportion will be calculated according to the me thod of Duffy and Santner. 
 
16.413 Over Accrual: If more than the target number of patients are accrued, the 
additional patients will not be used to  evaluate the stopping rule or used 
MC038C 57 MCCC Addendum 23 
IRB Version Date:  November 10, 2016   in any decision making processes; however, they will be included in final 
endpoint estimates and confidence intervals. 
 
16.42 Secondary Outcome Analyses 
 16.421 Overall survival is defined as the time from registration to death due to 
any cause.  The distribution of survival time will be estimated using the method of Kaplan-Meier. 
 
16.422 Time to progression is defined as the time from registration to the earliest 
date with documentation of disease progression   If a patient dies without 
a documentation of disease progression,  the patient will be considered to have had tumor progression at the time of their death unless there is sufficient documented evidence to conclude no progression occurred 
prior to death.  The distribution of time to progression will be estimated 
using the method of Kaplan-Meier.(Kaplan and Meier 1958)  The progression-free rate at 1 year and 2 years will be assessed. 
 16.423 Failure-free survival is defined as the time from registration to the 
earliest of progressive disease, alternative treatment for myeloma, or death due to any cause.  The distribution of failure-free survival will be estimated using the method of Kaplan-Meier. 
 
16.424 Adverse Events:  All eligible patient s that have initiated treatment will be 
considered evaluable for assessing adverse event rate(s).  The maximum 
grade for each type of adverse event will be recorded for each patient, 
and frequency tables will be reviewed to determine patterns.  Additionally, the relationship of the adverse event(s) to the study treatment will be taken into consideration. 
 
16.43 Correlative Analyses  
 
16.431  Data will be collected for a number of laboratory correlative 
variables as discussed before (e.g. viral replication and shedding). Descriptive statistics and scatterplots will form the basis of presentation of these variables. Correlations between the laboratory values and other outcome measures will be carried out  by standard parametric and non-
parametric tests (e.g. Pearson’s and Spearman’s rho). Data obtained from 
gamma camera imaging of MV-NIS following 99m-Tc infusion will be used to determine the biodistribution and kinetics of virus spread and NIS gene expression in vivo and correla te it with tumor distribution. We 
will also estimate the radiation dose that could be delivered to the bone 
marrow as well as critical organs such as the liver, lungs and kidneys if I-
131 were to be administered using MIRDOSE 3 program. Where patterns of correlation are indicated, ordinary and partial correlation coefficients (controlling for dose leve ls) will be calculated. Inferential 
testing for significant shifts in the correlative laboratory data results 
across dose levels will be carried out only as a hypothesis generating 
exercise.

IRB Version Date:  November 10, 2016    
16.5 Data & Safety Monitoring: 
 
16.51 Monitoring: Members of the study team will review the study regularly to review 
the progress of this protocol and be kept aware of efficacy and toxicity issues. 
This study will be monitored according to the MCCC Data Safety Monitoring 
Plan that is currently in place, and if necessary will report to the MCCC Data Safety Monitoring Board. Indications for temporary stopping the study include: a) unexpected toxicity of any of the drugs; b) unexpected difficulties with 
production of MV-NIS; and c) unexpected difficulties with any of the assays 
required to monitor patient safety (QT-PCR monitoring).  
16.52 The principle investigator(s) and the study statistician will review the study at 
least twice a year to identify accrual, adverse event, and any endpoint problems 
that might be developing. The Mayo Clin ic Cancer Center (MCCC) Data Safety 
Monitoring Board (DSMB) is responsible  for reviewing accrual and safety data 
for this trial at least twice a year, based on reports provided by the MCCC 
Statistical Office. 
 
16.521 Adverse Event Stopping Rules (to be evaluated in each cohort 
independently in the phase II portion):   The stopping rules specified below are based on the knowledge available at study development.  We note that the Adverse Event Stopping Rule may be adjusted in the event 
of either (1) the study re-opening to accrual or (2) at any time during the conduct of the trial and in consider ation of newly acquired information 
regarding the adverse event profile of the treatment(s) under investigation.  The study team may choose to suspend accrual because of unexpected adverse event profiles that have not crossed the specified rule 
below.   
 
Accrual will be temporarily suspended to this study if at any time we 
observe events considered at least po ssibly related to study treatment (i.e. 
an adverse event with attribute speci fied as  “possible,” “probable,” or 
“definite”) that satisfy one of the following:  · if 5 or more patients in the first 15 treated patients experience a grade 4 
or higher non-hematologic adverse event at least possibly related to 
treatment.  · if after the first 15 patients have been treated, 33% of all patients 
experience a grade 4 or higher non-hematologic adverse event at least 
possibly related to treatment.  
 
We note that we will review grade 4 and 5 adverse events deemed 
“unrelated” or “unlikely to be related” , to verify their attribution and to 
monitor the emergence of a previ ously unrecognized treatment-related 
adverse event. 
 
16.6 Results Reporting on ClinicalTrials.gov: At study activation, this study will have been 
registered within the “ClincialTrails.gov” website. The Primary and Secondary Endpoints 
along with other required information for this study will be reported on 
MC038C 59 MCCC Addendum 23 
IRB Version Date:  November 10, 2016   ClinicalTrials.gov. For purposes of timing of  the Results Reporting, the initial estimated 
completion date for the Primary Endpoint of th is study is  approximately 15 months after 
the implementation of Addendum 21. The definition of “Primary Endpoint Completion 
Date” (PECD) for this study is at the time the last patient registered has been followed for 
at least 3 months (and allowing 2 months for data entry). 
 
16.7 Subset Analyses for Women and Minorities : 
 
16.71 This study will be available to all e ligible patients, regardless of race, ethnic 
origin, and gender.  There is no information currently available regarding differential effects of this regimen in s ubsets defined by race or gender, and there 
is no reason to expect such differences to exist.  Therefore, although the planned analyses will, as always, look for differences in treatment effect based on gender and racial groupings, the sample size is not increased to provide additional power 
for subset analyses. 
 
16.72 Since women typically comprise 45% of this patient population, the number of 
women enrolled in this trial is expected to be at most approximately 38 
depending on the number of patients needed to establish the MTD. 
 
16.73 In prior Mayo Clinic studies in this disease, approximate 3% of all patients were 
classified as ethnic minorities.  Therefore, it is likely that only 1 or 2 patients classified as ethnic minorities will be enrolled in this trial.

GUIDELINES FOR MV-NIS ADMINISTRATION AND	DAY	1	AND	2	
PHARMACOKINETICS 	BY NURSING STAFF 
Synopsis:	Patients	have	been	asked	to	take 	part	in	this	study	because	th ey	have	evidence	
of	recurrent	or	refractory	MM	th at	has	progressed	through	estab lished	treatments.		We	are	
trying	to	find	new	treatments	th at	may	be	more	effective	at	tre ating	MM.		The	“drug”	used	
in	this	trial	is	a	modified	version	of	the	measles	virus	used	t o	vaccinate	children.		The	virus	
has	been	altered	by	having	extra	gene	added	for	a	protein	calle d	NIS	inserted	into	it.		NIS	is	
normally	found	in	the	thyroid	gl and	and	helps	the	body	concentr ate	iodine.		Having	this	
additional	gene	will	make	it	possi ble	to	track	where	this	virus 	goes	in	the	body  
1.0 Drug Information  
 
MV-NIS is a live, tissue culture adapted measles virus engineered to express the human thyroidal 
sodium iodide symporter (NIS). The virus was constructed by inserting the NIS gene (cDNA) 
into a full-length infectious molecular clone of an attenuated Edmonston lineage measles virus 
(MV-tag). This virus is not a vaccine. MV-NIS pr opagates on Vero cells with kinetics equivalent 
to the parental strain of virus. It propagates selectively in human cancer cells that it infects by 
binding preferentially to CD46, a membrane pr otein that is overexpressed in tumor cell lines 
including myeloma. The virus is directly cytopath ic to tumor cells leading to the formation of 
multinucleated syncytia that die by apoptosis. MV-NIS infected tumor cells express NIS, a 
membrane ion channel that actively transports iodide into cells. Radioiodine uptake by cells 
expressing NIS provides the basis for in vivo radioi odine imaging that can reveal the profile of 
MV-NIS gene expression and the location of MV-N IS infected cells during virus spread and 
elimination.  
 
1.1 Preparation and storage:  
 
 MV-NIS will be prepared at the Virus a nd Vector Production Laboratory (VVPL) of the 
Molecular Medicine Program at Mayo Clinic and stored at -80 C. The virus will be thawed and 
mixed with normal saline prior to administration according to good practice guidelines for any 
Biohazard Level 2 biological. A leak proof box, preferably equipped with a gasket seal lid, should 
be used for transport of MV-NIS from one location to another 
 The MV-NIS product will be dispensed with intravenous tubing attached that is primed 
with the base solution used for preparati on of the medication. The product will be 
dispensed in leak-proof packaging and contain a label indicating safe handling 
precautions are required.  
 The drug, dose, dilution, drug diluent, fi nal product concentration, labeling and 
documentation of the preparation are checked by a pharmacist prior to dispensing.

1.4 Other precautions:  
 In the hospital setting, utensils (e.g., bedpans, urinals) are cleaned with an institutionally 
approved detergent and rinsed twice following each use.  
 In the inpatient setting, the toilet is covered with a white professional towel (plastic side up) and flushed twice. The white professional towel is disposed of in a red biohazard bag or 
biohazard waste container.  
 Disposable patient care items contaminated with  blood or body secretions are placed in a red 
biohazard bag or biohazard waste container.  
 Soiled linen is placed in a clear plastic bag or a designated plastic chemotherapy bag and then 
put into a regular linen bag.  
 Eating and drinking are prohibited in the patie nt’s room during the infusion, and extreme 
precautions are taken while handling needles and other sharp instruments. 
 
 All spills should be reported. 
MC038C 71 MCCC Addendum 23 
IRB Version Date:  November 10, 2016    Cytotoxic Spill kits (MC115455) are available from Central Service at Rochester Methodist 
Hospital (RMH) or by paging the General Pa r Stock pager (127-05232) at Saint Marys 
Hospital (SMH). In the outpatient setting spill kits are obtained from the MIC Warehouse 
through the Lawson ordering system. A spill kit sh ould be obtained and available on a patient 
care unit/area prior to a patient receiving sp illable (non-solid) cytotoxic medications.  
 In case of a blood or body fluid exposure, thoroughly wash skin with soap and water; 
backbleed when appropriate; thoroughly rinse mucous membranes with water. Promptly 
report all exposures to management and Employ ee Health Services. Within 48 hours of the 
exposure, an Employee Incident  Report should be completed. 
1.5 Known potential toxicities of MV-NIS: 
 
MV-NIS was rescued from a derivative of the Ed monston B vaccine strain of measles virus and 
we anticipate that the most common toxicities will be similar to those experienced after the administration of the measles vaccine. The most common side-effects seen with high doses of 
MV-NIS have been high fever that lasts for a couple to several days, nausea and headache. These tend to be most severe within a couple of hours after completing infusion. Thus patients might 
experience moderate fever up to 39.4 C fever and rash (minimal) within the first 5 to 12 days 
after virus injection. However it should be noted that this vaccine related measles like illness has 
been described only in measles-naïve subjects. 
 Not uncommon reactions: 
 Moderate to high fever(with rigors)  lasting 1 – 2 days, starting within a week or two of 
vaccination 
 Nausea and vomiting 
 Headache 
 Cough and rhinitis 
 Arthralgias 
 Thrombocytopenia 
 Lymphopenia 
 Anemia 
 A rash, lasting 1 – 2 days 
 
Unexpected and rare reactions associated with the vaccine:  Allergic reactions including anaphylaxis 
 Reactions at the injection site such as a wheal, flare or urticaria 
 Diarrhea 
 Erythema multiforme 
 Giant cell pneumonia 
 Inclusion body encephalitis 
 Guillain-Barré syndrome 
 Vasculitis  
 Otitis media  
 Optic neuritis  
 Ataxia  
 
Viral transmission between patient and his/her cont acts is thought to be unlikely, unless the patient 
develops florid measles infection. The vaccine strain of the measles virus (of which MV-NIS is a 
MC038C 72 MCCC Addendum 23 
IRB Version Date:  November 10, 2016   derivative) has been shown to be shed in the urine of normal children undergoing routine vaccination. 
Despite the presence of viral shedding of the vaccine  strain of measles virus, there has been only 1 
case of symptomatic measles virus presumptively transmitted from a vaccinated individual (Rota et al 
J. Clin Microbiology 2005). However, since ot her patients on the Mayo Clinic grounds may be 
severely immunosuppressed, we will require that MV-N IS treated patients wear a mask when outside 
of their hospital room on Mayo Clinic grounds while they are shedding virus (tested by RT-qPCR). 
 
We will be particularly vigilant for symptoms s uggestive of either giant cell pneumonia or inclusion 
body encephalitis that have been rarely obser ved in immunocompromised patients who were 
administered the vaccine. If symptoms suggestive of persistent measles or either pneumonitis or 
encephalitis develop, the patients will be treated  aggressively with anti-measles virus immune 
globulin and ribavirin and all the supportive care necessary as the situation might dictate.

Who Initiated Contact Regarding Pr otocol Participation for inclusion/exclusion of MC038C, “A 
Phase I/II Trial of Systemic Administration of (Edmonston Strain) of Meas les Virus, Genetically 
Engineered to Express NIS, w ith or without Cyclophosphamide in  Patients with Recurrent or 
Refractory Multiple Myeloma”  
 AIMS, PURPOSE, OR OBJECTIVES:   
To provide better service to patients by allo wing a level of pre-scr eening prior to their 
investment in traveling to Rochester, MN to be  screened for trial par ticipation. This will be 
accomplished by contacting them, running through a checklist of eligibility criteria, and sending 
them a blood kit which can be co mpleted locally and returned to  the trial team. Patients have 
already contacted the study team e xpressing interest in the trial, so  they have made first contact. 
 
REASONING:  The reason is that there are more patients interested in  the trial than there are doses of drug. We 
are going through the list on a first contact, first serve basis to exclude those subjects who will 
not be eligible and save them unnecessary financial costs.   The logistics of the pre-scr eening process are as follows: 
 
1. The list of patients who have made contact ha ve been collated and organized by date of 
contact. 
2. Subjects who have expressed interest will be contacted by phone in the order in the spreadsheet. The telephone script ( Appendix II-1 ) and oral consent ( Appendix II-2 ) will 
be used to run through the eligibility check list. 
3. If patients appear to be eligible based on the check list, we will inst ruct them that they 
will be receiving a kit for a mail-in blood test  to check for measles virus anti-body titers 
along with a HIPAA Authorization to Use a nd Disclose Protected Health Information 
Form. The blood can be drawn at the time of a routine blood test. The kit will come with 
a self-paid mailing label. Cover letter is contained in Appendix II-3  and HIPPA form is 
Appendix II-4 ).  
4. Patients will be informed of the results of their measles titers. If titers are positive, the patients will be told that they are not eligible  for the trial, but that they are welcome to 
come to Mayo at any time for a consultation and/or participation in othe r clinical trials. If 
negative, the patients will be told that they are a potential candidate and offered an appointment. We will keep track of doses of  drug, availability of beds at CRU and on 
Hematology in-patient service .  
5. If there are more eligible patients than there are slots in the trial, we will call and/or mail 
these patients informing them of  the trial status without r unning through the checklist and 
without sending them the blood kit. We will ask them that if there is further expansion to 
the trial whether they would like to be contacted again at that time.

Introduction: 
Hello, this is ________________ calling from  the Mayo Clinic in Roches ter, Minnesota (if out of 
state).  May I please speak to _____________? 
***If the participant is there continue with the script. 
***If the participant is not there, ask when it would be a good time to speak with     
______________? 
 
Describe the Reason for the Call: 
(Example of phone call to potential participant) 
I am calling you because in May/June 2014 you expre ssed interest in our Phase II clinical MV-
NIS trial for patients with relapsed refractory myeloma. As we shared with you previously, the 
clinical trial will re-open in August/September  2014. There was tremendous interest in this 
treatment trial with more than 1000 inquiries. Sin ce the Phase 2 trial will have a maximum of 37 
slots available, we have genera ted a list of patients and are making contact to see if these 
individuals still have interest in  participating in this trial.  
 
Are you still interested? 
 
Please understand that your current or future me dical care at the Mayo Clinic will not be 
jeopardized if you choose  not to participate. 
If no : Thank them for their time and stop the recruitment process. 
If yes : Since you are still interested in enrolling on  the measles (MV-NIS) for myeloma clinical 
trial, we would like to make things as convenien t for you as possible. As the case for all clinical 
trials, there are ‘eligibility ‘cri teria, which means that there are certain requirements about you 
and your medical condition that are necessary to make you a candidate. To save you time and 
travel, I would like to run through se veral of these criteria with you.  
 
If we find that you are ineligible, you are still welcome to make an appointment to be seen at the 
Mayo Clinic to receive care/recommendations about  your multiple myeloma and/or participate in 
another clinical trial.  
MC038C 75 MCCC Addendum 23 
IRB Version Date:  November 10, 2016    
If the screening questions would suggest that you ar e eligible, the next step would be to 
determine if you have existing immunity to the m easles virus. Our studies show that if you have 
existing antibodies to measles (as measured by a blood test), it is almost a guarantee that the 
MV-NIS will not provide you with any benefit, so the absence of measles tite rs is an eligibility 
criterion.   For your convenience, we can send you a blood test kit that you can bring to your local 
laboratory to draw and mail back to us. If the te st shows that there are no antibodies, then you 
will likely be eligible for the trial. If the test  is show antibodies to measles, then you would not 
be a candidate for the trial. Once again, you are stil l welcome to make an appointment to be seen 
by one of our myeloma specialists; however, if the only reason that you would consider coming 
to the Mayo Clinic in Rochester at  this time would be to participat e on this particular trial, then 
we will have saved you the trip. 
There is no payment for your travel expenses. Th e standard of care myeloma therapy will not be 
covered by the trial, but all of the extra blood work and scans rela ted to the trial will be free of 
charge. There are several days of testing followed by admission to our clinic al research unit for a 
day and a night during which time you would get the therapy and be monitored for side-effects. 
Additional blood work and scans are done 2, 7, 14 and 42 days after treatment in all patients. 
Some patients also require testing 21 and 28 days after treatment.  
There is no guarantee that this treatment will help  your myeloma, but we are hopeful that it will. 
Are you interested in hearing more and going thro ugh the checklist to see if you may be eligible?  
If no : Thank them for their time and stop the recruitment process. 
If yes : I would like to receive your formal permissi on to ask you questions and to potentially 
offer you the opportunity to have a blood test kit se nt to you for further testing to see if you are 
potentially eligible.

 IRB #: 06-005263 Principal Investigator: Angela Dispenzieri 
 
You are being asked to answer questions in orde r to screen you for elig ibility for the MV-NIS 
(measles for myeloma) Phase II clin ical trial. If the answers to  the questions suggest that you 
may be eligible for the clinical trial, we will invi te you to have a blood test done at home to see if 
you have antibodies to the measles virus. If you do have immunity to the measles virus, there 
would not be any potential advantage for you to participate on the treatment trial. 
 If you agree to participate you w ill be asked to answer about 30 questions. You will not receive 
any payment for your participation.  The risks associated with the first pass screen ing portion of this research study are time burden 
and discomfort during interviews. Using sensitiv e questions during the oral consent process is 
common and can often lead to discomfort. You could also experience so me discomfort during 
the blood draw. Otherwise, ther e are no known physical risks to you from taking part in the 
screening portion of this research study. 
 The benefits which may reasonably be expected to result from this screening are possible 
eligibility for the MV-NIS (m easles) for myeloma trial. 
 Please understand your participati on is voluntary and you have th e right to withdraw your 
consent or discontinue participa tion at any time without penalty.  Specifically, your current or

Dear {Mr., Ms, or Mrs.}  
 
You are being asked to participate in a pre-scr eening research study for the Phase I/II measles 
trial for patients with myeloma. You previous ly contacted the Mayo C linic stating that you 
would like information or were interested in participating in the MC038C trial. This pre-screening process is being done to find out if you do/do not qualify for pot ential participation in 
the measles for myeloma Phase I/ II trial without you having to physic ally travel to Mayo Clinic 
and incur unnecessary financial costs.  
 Please understand your participati on is voluntary and you have th e right to withdraw your 
consent or discontinue participa tion at any time without penalty.  Specifically, your current or 
future medical care at the Mayo Clinic will not be  jeopardized if you choose not to participate.  
 If you agree to participate, you w ill be asked to sign the enclosed authorization form and have 10 
cc (2 teaspoons) of blood drawn (k it enclosed) from a vein in your  arm during your next routine 
clinical lab work up at your local treating medical facility. This lab kit will be mailed back to us 
by that facility for processing. This  process can take up to two week s. You will be notified of the 
results by either phone or mail.   If you do qualify, you will be invited for an appoi ntment for further medical evaluations and 
formal trial screening for the measles for myeloma Phase I/II trial. There is no guarantee that you 
will still meet the qualifi cations at that time.  
 All information related to your multiple myeloma disease including current treatments, labs, past 
vaccines) obtained from you during this pre-scre ening process from the research team will be 
kept confidential. If you do not qualify or if you chose later not to participate, all information 
obtained from you up to that point will be de stroyed immediately by the research team.

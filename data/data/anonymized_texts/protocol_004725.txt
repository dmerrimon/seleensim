 1.0 Introduction and Background  
 
Endometrial cancer is the most common gynecologic malignancy, and with 
approximately two- thirds of cases being diagnosed at an early stage it carries an 
excellent 5- year overall survival of approximately 95%.1 Survivors of endometrial cancer 
are more likely to die of their comorbidities than their cancer, and cardiovascular 
disease (CVD) is not only the leading cause of death in the United States but has also  
been found to be the leading cause of death among endometrial cancer patients.2-4 This 
is likely due to the multiple overlapping risk factors for endometrial cancer and CVD 
including obesity and metabolic syndrome, elevating the importance of addressing 
cardiovascular (CV) health in routine survivorship care.5,6 Treatment of endometrial 
cancer adds to this risk, with a decrease in physical activity and subsequent weight gain 
during the post -operative period and concurrently undergoing adjuvant treatment with 
chemotherapy or radiation.  
The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) recommends assessment 
of CVD  risk in their endometrial cancer survivorship guidelines.9 This is reinforced in 
the primary gynecologic oncology literature, with CVD risk assessment in patients with endometrial cancer suggested to be implemented as early in survivorship care as possible.
2 However, implementing this guideline in routine oncology practice may be 
challenging. Using survey data of over 1500 patients with breast, prostate, colorectal and gynecologic cancers, Weaver at al. found that one in three survivors with at least one CV risk factor reported no discussion of health promotion with their oncologic provider.
10 Similarly, in a survey of 700 patients with a cancer diagnosis, Nicolaije et al. 
found that 35% of patient responded that they were minimally informed on how to improve their health, with 42% responding that they were completely uninformed on how to improve their health.
11 Ninety percent of oncologists in an electronic health 
record (EHR) tool pilot study (18 of 20) reported CV health discussions to be “somewhat” or “very” important; however, 58% “rarely” or “sometimes” discuss CV health with their patient s.
12 As a result, oncologists make few referrals for CV care to 
primary care and cardiology for guideline- driven follow -up care.10,13- 15  
Primary care is a key partner for managing CV health among cancer survivors. 
We are not aware of any studies specifically looking at primary care practitioner (PCP) utilization by endometrial cancer survivors , however,  studies have shown that up to 20% 
of patients with a history of breast or colon cancer did not see a PCP within the first year of survivorship.
7,8 Unsurprisingly, these patients were less likely to get preventative care 
and have chronic and general health issues managed than those who saw a PCP in 
addition to an oncology provider. Data from the original Automated Heart Health 
Assessment ( AH-HA) team and others show that survivors want to have preventative 
discussions with their oncologists.16 Although some oncology providers are hesitant to 
address obesity and exercise in cancer survivors, exercise recommendations by 
providers increase cancer survivors’ physical activity by up to 30 minutes per week.17-19 
Behavioral interventions for weight loss, exercise, diet, and smoking cessation, even if 
brief, can be successful in improving CV health among cancer survivors.20-25 For 
example, the odds of abstinence from smoking at 6 months increased 66% with provider lifestyle advice.

 Web- based cardiovascular health assessment tools may play an important role in 
successful guideline implementation. The AH -HA tool, currently being tested in a large 
multi -site trial, is a provider facing EHR -embedded CV health assessment tool that 
renders  a visual, interactive display of CVH risk factors, automatically populated from 
the EHR.26 However, EHR integrated tools may require substantial time and cost for 
successful integration. A similar tool, named PREVENT, was developed by co-
investigators on the proposed study using the American Heart Association (AHA) Simple 7 criteria for adolescent and young adult cancer patients, but is a web based, patient facing tool. This tool provides a graphic representation of the validated overall CV health score based on the Simple 7 risk factors
27, and provides behavior change 
recommendations to improve CV health. Provider and patient facing tools may offer 
implementation options to oncology clinics or be used as complementary strategies.  
In this study, we will pilot an adapted version of the PREVENT tool for 
endometrial cancer survivors. This study will focus on the feasibility of using the 
PREVENT tool within routine follow- up care for endometrial cancer.  
2.0 Objectives 
2.1 Primary Objective

 3.2 Exclusion Criteria   
3.2.1 Currently receiving treatment (e.g. radiation, chemotherapy, 
immunological treatments for endometrial cancer)  
3.2.2 Have a history of endometrial cancer recurrence  
3.2.3 Enrolled in hospice care or documentation of life expectancy < 6 months  
3.3 Inclusion of Women and minorities  
3.3.1 Women of all races and ethnicity who meet the above- described 
eligibility criteria are eligible for this trial. All of the participants will be women.  
 
Minority Estimates: Similar to the national population data for cancer survivors and the demographics of the cancer patient population at the CCCWFU, non- Hispanic whites are expected to 
comprise the majority of our sample.  Based on our cancer center data,  we expect approximately 2% of included participants to be 
Hispanic/Latino (N=1). The breakdown of racial categories is expected to be as follows:  14% Black or African American (N= 5), 
and 84% White (N= 35), and 2% more than one race (N=1).  
 
Should we not meet or exceed these estimates, the PI will engage 
the Office of Cancer Health Equity  to discuss strategies to enhance 
recruitment in these target populations.

4.2 Experimental  or Data Collection Methods 
 
Data will be collected through patient surveys via REDCap, and the PREVENT tool, as well as via m edical chart abstraction for lab values and 
vital signs.  
 
4.2.1 EHR data extraction Patient demographics (e.g., sex, date of birth, race/ethnicity) and the most recent risk factors for CVH (height, weight, fasting blood glucose, total cholesterol, blood pressure, smoking status) will be extracted at baseline (prior to clinic visit ). Available EHR data will 
be uploaded into PREVENT prior to the clinic visit but may be updated within the PREVENT tool at the time of the clinic visit if updated values are attained. W e acknowledge that not all patients 
will have updated information for CVH risk  factors (fasting blood 
glucose, Hemoglobin A1c and total cholesterol). This pilot study is 
intended to determine what data are commonly available for a future study. We expect that height and weight will be the most commonly available data point .

 oncology provider. Patients will consent to the study and complete a brief 
questionnaire electronically prior to presenting for their office visit. Once they have been roomed in the office, a research team member will assist them in the use of the PREVENT tool, yielding a cardiovascular health score. Questions regarding the score will be directed towards their oncologic provider. They will then complete a brief questionnaire immediately after the visit. Chart review will be conducted 3 months after the visi t.  
 
Consent and Survey Administration: We will request a waiver of signed 
informed consent for the study (see Protection of Human Subjects). Potential participants identified from cancer center appointment schedules or referred by clinicians and navigators will be recruited by patient portal, phone, or in- person to 
complete brief web -based surveys before and after their regularly scheduled 
medical appointment. A record of screening failures will be captured Survey 
participants will receive a $10 gift card.   
 Pre-Assessment Questionnaire: Prior to exposure to the PREVENT tool,  we 
will ask 8  questions about CVH knowledge and perceived importance and 
appropriateness of heart health discussions during oncology care.   PREVENT Tool Interaction: While the patient is having their regularly scheduled 
medical appointment, the study coordinator will review their medical chart for cardiovascular risk information (weight, height, smoking status, blood pressure, total cholesterol, and hemoglobin A1c or f asting glucose). The most recent data 
will be entered in the PREVENT tool for the patient. We will help survivors 
access a patient -facing version of the PREVENT tool using a personal device or 
a study tablet computer. Survivors wi ll use a personal email address to log- in to 
the patient -facing web application and will receive a welcome email after 
configuring their PREVENT profile.  Patients will have the opportunity to review and update any of their cardiovascular risk information, as well as read information about cardiovascular health. The research coordinat or will assist 
survivors in using the tool if requested.   
 Post -Assessment Questionnaires: Following survivor interaction with the 
PREVENT tool, survivors will complete:  
 
• The same eight  pre-assessment questionnaire along with three additional 
questions .  
 
• We will additionally ask 5 questions regarding use of the PREVENT tool .  
 Collection of Post -Intervention Clinical Follow Up:  Data will be collected 
about referrals, labs and new medications that occur during the 3- month period 
after their use of the study tool.

 5.0 Outcome Measures 
5.1 Primary Outcome  
Proportion of patients who consent to the study and complete the web-
based heart health assessment.  
5.2 Secondary Outcomes  
5.2.1 Secondary objective 2.2.1, patient satisfaction identified through 
post-visit survey with a 5 -point Likert scale  (strongly agree to 
strongly disagree)  regarding liking the tool, helpfulness , ease of 
understanding and desire to use this tool with their oncologist.  
 
5.2.2 Secondary objective 2.2.2, proportion of patients who report 
initiating discussions regarding cardiovascular health, identified through post -visit survey.  
6.0 Analytic Plan  
6.1 Sample Size and Power  
 This pilot study has an accrual goal of 42 endometrial cancer survivors. 
This study focuses on the feasibility of implementing the PREVENT  tool to 
promote discussion of cardiovascular health risks between providers and cancer survivors. Feasibility will be defined from the proportion of patients who complete the web- based assessment. A sample size of 42 total 
participants will have 83 % power to detect a hypothesized participation 
rate of 8 0% or more with an unacceptable participation rate considered 
60% or  less. This assumes a conservative 10% dropout of participants 
prior to the time of visit, with a one- sided alpha=0.05, and one- sample 
exact binomial test.  Assuming 37 survivors complete the assessment, we 
will be able to estimate participation within +/ - 17% using exact 95% 
binomial confidence intervals. A sample size of 37 survivors would allow 
for reasonable estimates of SDs that could be used for future studies.  
6.2 Analysis of Primary Outcome  
For our primary objective, analyses will be largely descriptive (using means, medians, frequencies etc.).  
6.3 Analysis of Secondary Outcomes  
For secondary objective 2.2.1, patient satisfaction with the tool, one- sample 
t-tests will be used to test whether the average response to each question is 
greater than 3.5 (with three denoting a neutral response).  Wilcoxon signed 
rank tests will be used to compare cancer survivors’ knowledge regarding their cardiovascular health risk factors and perceived importance of cancer

Categorical comparisons  will be evaluated with Fisher’s Exact test.  
 
For secondary objective 2.2.2, analyses will be largely descriptive (using 
means, medians, frequencies etc.).  
6.4 Accrual Rate  
Accrual is expected to be 10 patients per month, based on an estimated 20 endometrial cancer survivors seen by the gynecologic oncology department for surveillance in the average month.  
6.5 Length of Study  
Targeted accrual should be met in approximately 6  months. A maximum of 
42 patients will be enrolled on this trial.

This project will utilize REDCap Clinical Data Interoperability Services. This is a special 
feature for importing data into REDCap from WakeOne. It provides an adjudication 
process whereby REDCap users can approve all incoming data from WakeOne before it 
is officially saved in their REDCap project. REDCap Clinical Data Interoperability 
Services can only be enabled by a REDCap administrator who serves as an honest 
broker to PHI. REDCap’s Clinical Data Interoperability Services can only be accessed by 
users with valid WakeOne credentials. Using the Clinical Data Interoperability Service 
requires using the Medical Record Number (MRN) as a key to automatically gather 
demographics and laboratory data and reduces data entry errors. 
8.0 Confidentiality and Privacy 
 
Confidentiality will be protected by collecting only information needed to assess 
study outcomes, minimizing to the fullest extent possible the collection of any information that could directly identify subjects, and maintaining all study information in a secure manner. To help ensure subject privacy and confidentiality, only a unique study identifier will appear on the data collection form. Any collected patient identifying information corresponding to the unique study identifier will be maintained on a li nkage file, store separately from the 
data. The linkage file will be kept secure, with access limited to designated study personnel. Following data collection,  subject identifying information will be 
destroyed two years after closure of the study, consistent with data validation and 
study design, producing an anonymous analytical data set. Data access will be limited to study staff. Data and records will be kept locked and secured, with any

9.0 Data Safety and Monitoring  
 
The principal investigator will be responsible for the overall monitoring of the data 
and safety of study participants. The principal investigator will be assisted by 
other members of the study staff.  
 
Data will be stored on a secure information technology -maintained computing 
infrastructure behind the WFBH firewall, which has been certified to store 
protected health information. Data from the PREVENT tool will also be stored on 
a secure information technology -maintained platform (Google Firebase) that 
complies with HIPPA standards. We will take consistent measures to protect the confidentiality of these data. When the data are collected and ready for analysis, the dataset will be downloaded by Dr. DeMari  and used only for the purposes 
identified in these analys es. Only approved members of the research team will 
have access to these data.  
10.0 Reporting of Unanticipated Problems, Adverse Events or 
Deviations 
 
Any unanticipated problems, deviations or protocol changes will be promptly 
reported by the principal investigator or designated member of the research team 
to the IRB and sponsor or appropriate government agency if appropriate.

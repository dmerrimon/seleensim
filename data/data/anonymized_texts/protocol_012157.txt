1 INTRODUCTION
41.1 Background 
Onychomycosis, a common pathology of the toenails, is even more prevalent among diabetic 
subjects. Nearly 26 million Americans suffer from diabetes, and approximately one-third of 
subjects with diabetes have toenail onychomycosis. Numerous studies have addressed the 
efficacy and safety of both topical and oral antifungal treatment options for onychomycosis in 
diabetic subjects. However, no study to date has specifically addressed the efficacy and safety 
of efinaconazole among diabetic subjects.
1.2 Potential Pharmacotherapy
Despite the existence of numerous topical antifungal agents for onychomycosis, data 
investigating the efficacy of topical antifungal agents among exclusively diabetic patient cohorts 
is limited. Ciclopirox 8% was evaluated in 2007 as a topical solution among a cohort 49 diabetic 
subjects. The study witnessed clinical improvement in 63.4% of subjects, with 54.3% attaining 
mycologic cure (Brenner et al., 2007).  An earlier, 2001 study of ciclopirox 8% solution 
summarized the results of a 215-person diabetic subset of subjects. This study was 
observational, noncomparative, and uncontrolled, thereby limiting the usefulness of the data. 
The study reported that the mean affected nail area decreased from 64.3% to 25.7% after 6 
months of treatment (Seebacher, 2001). 
1.3 Efinaconazole 10% Solution Description
Efinaconazole 10% solution is a new triazole antifungal agent. The medication was developed 
specifically for the topical treatment of distal and lateral subungual onychomycosis (DLSO) (
Gupta, 2014). The medication was developed with consideration of the existing triazole 
antifungals itraconazole and fluconazole, with the formulation developed to more effectively 
penetrate the nail plate. The preparation was further enhanced with the development of nail 
lacquers to avoid product build-up and to reduce removal time. The solution is, specifically, an 
inhibitor of sterol 14alpha-demethylase (14-DM) (Tatsumi, 2013). In broth dilution tests in vitro, 
the solution was found to be more potent against reference strains than other common 
antifungals, including terbinafine, ciclopirox, itraconazole, and amorolfine, (Jo Siu, 2013).
1.4 Efinaconazole Safety and Adverse Effects
The safety of efinaconazole has been document in both Phase II and Phase III trials. Treatment 
associated adverse events have been relatively frequent by incidence, but of low morbidity and 
of frequency similar to vehicle alone. Two phase III studies noted rates for a single adverse 
event during treatment to be similar between efinaconazole to vehicle: in one study, 66% versus
61%, and in the second study, 64.5% versus 58.5% (Elewski, 2013). These adverse events 
included contact dermatitis (2.9% versus 1.9%, 1.4% versus 1.0%), eczema (3.4% versus 3.3%,
information not available in the second study), application site dermatitis (3.5% versus 0.0%, 
information not available in the second study), and application site vesicles (2.0% versus 0.0%, 
information not available in the second study). Discontinuation of the study as a result of 
adverse events was low, with 3.2% of treatment versus 0.5% of vehicle in the first study and 1.
9% versus 0.0% in the second.
An additional study investigated if efinaconazole had a relationship with contact sensitization (
Del Rosso, 2013). The study involved nine applications of efinaconazole 10% solution versus 
5vehicle over a three week period, with multiple follow-up applications three weeks later. The 
study concluded that the cumulative irritation scores were comparable between efinaconazole 
and vehicle alone.
1.5 Efinaconazole Indications
It is currently indicated for onychomycosis of the toenails (s) due to:
●Trichophyton rubrum
●Trichophyton mentagrophytes 
2 STUDY DESIGN 
2.1 Study Objective
6The objective of this noncomparative, uncontrolled study is to determine the efficacy of topical 
efinaconazole 10% for toenail onychomycosis among subjects with diabetes mellitus. Specific 
indicators to measure efficacy of treatment will be the mycological cure rate, complete cure rate, 
and treatment success. Furthermore, an additional goal of the study is to gain knowledge of safety 
in the setting of a cohort of diabetic subjects. Safety will be determined by the incidence and nature 
of treatment associated adverse events. These will be recorded at each follow-up visit. 
2.2 Treatment Groups 
Adult subjects (18 years or older) with a medical history of controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus will be
considered for enrollment. Subjects will be eligible for enrollment if a clinical diagnosis of distal 
onychomycosis involving at least 20% of one great toenail (GT) has been made and confirmed by 
nail biopsy. There will be no restriction based on nail involvement; up to 100% of the nail may be 
involved. Furthermore, there will be no restriction based on toenail plate thickness. The enrollment 
period will be continued until 48 intention-to-treat subjects have been enrolled in the study.
2.3 Study Duration
The intended enrollment period will be six months, though this may be extended if necessary to  
achieve 48 intention-to-treat subjects. The treatment period, following enrollment, will be 50 weeks 
in duration. The intended total study duration, then, will be 76 weeks.
2.4 Efficacy Endpoints
Mycological cure will be defined as negative KOH examination and negative fungal culture of the 
target toenail sample.  
Clinical cure will be defined as 0% clinical involvement of the target toenail. Almost clinical cure 
will be defined as ≤10% clinical involvement of the target toenail.  
Complete cure will be defined as 0% clinical involvement and mycological cure. Treatment 
success will be defined as ≤10% clinical involvement of the target toenail and mycological cure. 
2.4.1 Primary Endpoints
1. The primary efficacy end point will be the proportion of subjects achieving complete cure at week 
50.
2.4.2 Secondary Endpoints
1. The secondary efficacy end points will include mycological cure rate, treatment success rate, 
clinical cure rate, and almost clinical cure rate.
2.4.3 Safety Endpoints
1. Type of Adverse Events
2. Frequency of Adverse Events
2.5 Measurement Methods
At each study visit, the treating podiatrist will visually and physically assess subjects.

Subjects will be advised to contact study coordinators if they notice signs of any of the aforementioned 
adverse effects. 
3.2 Contraindications to Efinaconazole administration
●Known hypersensitivity to efinaconazole
3.3 Benefits of Study 
The potential benefits of treating onychomycosis have been well-documented; these benefits are only 
heightened in the setting of diabetes mellitus.  A recent report investigated the impact of successful 
treatment with efinaconazole 10% solution among a group of subjects with onychomycosis. The study 
found a statistically greater improvement in all investigated aspects of quality of life compared to a 
controlled vehicle group (Tosti , 2014). Furthermore, the risk profile of the topical medication have been 
documented and represent qualitatively small levels of risk.
It is believed that the potential benefits of this study outweigh the potential risks.
4SUBJECT SELECTION
8Prior to enrollment, an informed consent must be obtained. Eligibility will be determined by the 
established inclusion and exclusion criteria. Assuming a 50% screen rate, it is anticipated that a total
of 96 subjects will need to be screened to reach 48 intention-to-treat subjects. Using an estimate of 
55% for mycologic cure, 48 subjects will yield a 95% confidence interval of 0.281. 
4.1 Informed Consent/Screening Visit
Subjects will complete a written informed consent prior to enrollment. This will be administered by the 
investigators at the study site in the patient’s preferred language (English or Spanish). The informed 
consent must be signed and dated. Each subject will be assigned a number in ascending order 
beginning from 01. A screening log of all the subjects will  be obtained for each written informed consent
. The screening log includes: screening number, first and last name, age, gender, eligibility status or 
reason for ineligibility. This information will be stored in a locked security box, and kept in a locked 
cabinet at the Arrowhead Regional Medical Center. This will be accessible only by specifically 
designated study personnel.

Subjects will be informed of all beneficial and adverse effects of efinaconazole during the written and 
oral consent process (refer to sections 3.1 and 4)
5.3.3 Subject Compensation
Subjects will be compensated a stipend for each attended office visit following screening. The amount 
of compensation will be of reasonable amount, and not excessively large as to inappropriately motivate 
subjects.
6 SUBJECT COMPLETION OR DISCONTINUATION
126.1 Subject Completion
The subject will be considered to have completed the study after completed the week 50 follow-up 
evaluation.
6.2 Subject Discontinuation
The subject will be discontinued from the study if the subject withdraws, is withdrawn due to an adverse
event, or is no longer able to be located. Any reason for discontinuation must be documented along 
with information about the health of the subject at the time of withdrawal. All attempts to contact subject
must be documented. After 3 documented attempts of contact, the subject will be considered 
discontinued.
6.3 Early Termination Appointment
If the subject elects to discontinue the study prior to completion, the subject will be asked to attend an 
early termination appointment. This early termination appointment will replace the final office visit. It will 
include the procedures of a follow-up office visit, with the addition of a complete history and physical. 
Subjects will be provided increased, but not excessive, financial compensation as motivation for 
attending this appointment. 
7SAFETY ASSESSMENTS
A safety evaluation will be conducted at every visit. 
137.1 Safety Evaluation
Safety will be assessed by recording the nature, intensity, and duration of treatment related adverse 
events. Safety analyses will be performed on both an intention-to-treat and per-protocol analysis basis. 
The intention-to-treat population will include each patient receiving at least one dose of the medication, 
with at least one post-baseline assessment.
7.2 Adverse Events
An adverse event may be any unintended clinical, radiographic, or laboratory result associated with the 
use of treatment modality. An adverse event does not necessarily have causal relationship with the 
treatment intervention. 
 
Information collected during subject screening serves to determine if an adverse event started before or
during the course of study and to monitor its progression throughout the course of the study. Follow-up 
evaluation and treatment will continue until the adverse event has resolved. 
7.2.2 Adverse Events Causality 
Adverse events will be assessed for causality. The event is considered related to the treatment 
intervention if there is a reasonable possibility that the treatment could have contributed to the event. 
Evidence supporting the relation between treatment and adverse event can be derived from scientific 
and medical facts, observation, and professional opinion.
7.3 Serious Adverse Events
An adverse event is considered serious if:
●it results in death
●it is life threatening 
●it requires hospitalization 
●it results in disability or incapacity 
●it jeopardizes the health of the subject
7.4 Documentation and Reporting of Adverse Events
Adverse events will be documented. Serious adverse events will be completely reported to the study 
grant sponsor, the institutional review board (IRB), and to the University Compliance Office, within 24 
hours of becoming aware of the serious adverse event. 
8SUBJECT PROTECTION REQUIREMENTS
The Principal Investigator is required to provide an Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Ethics Committee 
with necessary materials. The study cannot commence until the IRB/Ethics Committee provides written 
14approval of the proposed pilot study. Appropriate reports of progress of this study will be provided to

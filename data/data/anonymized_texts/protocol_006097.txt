Study Design: 
This will be a 3 -month, double -masked, randomized, multi -center, active -controlled, parallel- group safety and 
efficacy trial for reduction of elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) with PG324 Ophthalmic Solution compared to 
each of its acti ve components, AR -13324 0.02% and latanoprost 0.005% , in subjects at least 18 years of age ( at 
least 19 years for subjects in Canada) with open angle glaucoma (OAG) or ocular hypertension (OHT) .  All 
investigational products will be dosed QD (PM) .  Eligible subjects are required to  have  a diagnosis of either 
OAG or OHT  in both eyes .  Subject s who agree to participate in this study and are randomiz ed in the study will 
attend a total of 6 study visits: a Screening Visit, Qualification Visit #1, Qualification Visit #2/Day 1 (baseline), 
Week 2 (Day 15), Week 6 (Day  43), and Month 3 (Day 90) .  Subject s currently using ocular hypotensive 
medication will be required to undergo a wash  out for a specified  period (5 days -4 weeks, depending on the 
medication) prior to attending Qualification Visit #1 .  Subject s eligible to be enrolled in this study must meet all 
inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria at each of the Screening Visit and Qualification Visits #1 
and #2.  Among multiple procedures, subje cts will receive an eye examination including IOP measurements at 
Qualification Visits #1 and #2 and, if deemed eligible, will be enrolled at Qualification Visit #2 and assigned to 
PG324 Ophthalmic Solution  
Clinical Study Protocol: PG324 -CS30 2, Amendment 1  Aerie Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
Confidential  Page 6 of 93 1 of 3 investigational products in a 1:1:1 ratio according to a computer -generated randomization list .  
Randomization will take place using IWRS methodology and will stratify subject s by site and by maximum 
baseline IOP (< 25 mmHg vs ≥ 25 mmHg).  Randomiz ed subject s will dose the assigned investigational product 
in both eyes QD in the evening beginning on Day 1 and up to and including the evening prior to the Month 3 
visit.  Procedures conducted at each visit will include safety and efficacy measurements, including IOP at the 
following time points: 08:00, 10:00, and 16:00 hours .  Subject s will be seen in the clinic for safety and efficacy 
assessments during the treatment period at Weeks 2 and 6, and Month 3 .   Following completion of the Month 3 
study visit procedures, subject s will exit from the study .  For subject s who discontinu e early, every possible 
effort will be made to assure there is an exit  visit that includes all required examinations  listed for Visit 6 
(Month 3 ) and dilated ophthalmoscopy . 
Inclusion criteria:  
Subject s have to meet all of the following criteria at screening and qualification visits to enter into the study:

OHT in the fellow eye is acceptable)
3.Unmedicated (post -washout) IOP > 20 mmHg and < 36 mmHg in both eyes at 2 qualification  visits at
08:00 hour, 2-7 days apart.  At the second qualification visit, have  IOP > 17 mmHg and < 36 mmHg in
both eyes at 10:00 and 16:00 hours .  Note: For purposes of determining eligibility of subjects to be
enrolled, any non- integral mean IOP number should not be rounded.

Study Population:  
Approximately 690 subject s will be randomized  in this study at approximately 50 clinical sites, comprising 
approximately 230 subject s per each of 3 treatment arm s.  Subject s who are randomiz ed in this study will be 
those at least 18 years of age (at least 19 years of age in Canada) with diagnosed open angl e glaucoma (OAG) 
or ocular hypertension (OHT), each of whom meets all inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria.  
Investigational Product s, Dose, and Mode of Administration : 
•PG324 Ophthalmic Solution, 1 drop QD (PM) , OU
•AR-13324 Ophthalmic Solution 0.02%, 1 drop QD (PM) , OU
•Latanoprost ophthalmic solution 0.005%, 1 drop QD (PM) , OU
Duration of Treatmen t: 
Subject s will dose in the evening for approximately 90 days continuously 
Efficacy Assessments: 
The primary efficacy variable will be: 
•IOP measurements at 08:00, 10:00, and 16:00 hours at Week 2 (Day 15), Week 6 (Day 43), and Month 3
(Day 90) by Goldmann applanation tonometry  
The primary efficacy outcome will be  the comparison of PG324 Ophthalmic Solution relative to each of its 
active components, AR -13324  0.02%  and latanoprost  0.005% , for: 
•Mean IOP within a treatment group at the following time points: 08:00, 10:00, and 16:00 hours at the
Week  2, Week 6, and Month 3 study visits   
Secondary efficacy outcomes will include a summary of th e following  comparison s of PG324 Ophthalmic 
Solution relative to each of its active components (AR -13324 0.02% and latanoprost  0.005% ) for:  
•Mean IOP within a treatment group at each post -treatment time point
•Mean diurnal IOP within a treatment group at eac h post-treatment visit
•Mean change from diurnally adjusted baseline IOP at each post -treatment time point
•Mean change from baseline in diurnal IOP at each post -treatment visit
•Mean percent change from diurnally adjusted baseline IOP at each post -treatment time point
PG324 Ophthalmic Solution  
Clinical Study Protocol: PG324-CS302, Amendment 1 Aerie Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

 • Mean percent change from baseline in di urnal IOP at each post-treatment visit 
• Percentages of subjects achieving pre-specified mean, mean change, and percent mean change in diurnal 
IOP levels 
Other secondary efficacy analyses may be carried out as  described in the study Statistical Analysis Plan. 
Safety Assessments  (see Appendix 1 : Schedule of Visits and Procedures): 
The primary safety assessments in both eyes of enrolled subjects will include: 
• Ocular symptoms/adverse events 
• Ocular comfort test  
• Pachymetry and gonioscopy 
• ETDRS corrected visual acuity 
• Pupil size 
• Objective findings of biomicroscopic examinations (ie,  anterior segment examinations including evaluation 
of cornea, conjunctiva, lids, and lens) 
• Visual field and cup-disc ratio measurements 
• Corneal endothelial cell counts by specular microscopy (selected sites) 
• Dilated ophthalmoscopy 
Other safety assessments will be: 
• Systemic safety assessments as measured by heart rate, blood pressure, and clinical laboratory evaluations 
(including hematology and clinical chemistry)  
• Pregnancy testing (for women of child bearing potential) 
Statistical Methods:   
The primary analysis of th e primary efficacy outcome will employ a linear model with mean IOP at the given 
visit (Week 2, Week 6, and Month 3) and time point (08:00, 10:00, and 16:00 hours) as the response, baseline 
IOP as a covariate, and treatment as a main effect factor, using the intent to treat population with multiple imputation techniques used to impute missing data.  Each time point within each visit will be modeled 
separately.  The least squares mean differences (test – control) between PG324 Ophthalmic Solution and each 
of latanoprost ophthalmic solution 0.005% and AR-13324 Ophthalmic Solution 0.02% will be presented as well as 2-sided p-values and 95% confidence intervals.  Infe rence will be made on the p-value < 0.05 for all time 
points at the Week 2, Week 6, and Month 3 Visits.   
One-hundred ninety six (196) subjects per arm completing 3 months of treatment yields at least 90% power to 
conclude statistical superiority of PG324 to latanoprost and > 99% power to conclude statistical superiority of 
PG324 to AR-13324 at all nine pre-specified time points, assuming a two-sided alpha = 0.05, a true mean 
difference of 1.5 mmHg (to latanoprost) and 2.0 mmHg (to AR-13324), a common standard deviation of 
3.5 mmHg at each time point, and independence among time points. Power increases as the correlation among 
time points increases.  Therefore, 196 subjects pe r arm yield at least 90% power to conclude superiority to both 
controls over all nine time points.  Approximately 230 subjects will be enrolled per arm to yield 196 subjects 
completing 3 months of treatment, assuming an early discontinuation rate of about 15%.

 1. INTRODUCTION 
1.1 Investigational P roduct  
Glaucoma is a progressive optic neuropathy that causes characteristic loss of visual fields and 
can eventually lead to blindness.  A major risk factor for glaucomatous visual field loss is 
elevated intraocular pressure ( AGIS 2000 ).  
The need for improved efficacy of glaucoma medications is supported by several clinical studies.  Studies such as the Early Manifest Glaucoma Trial  (Heijl 2002) , the Ocular 
Hypertension Treatment Study  (Kass 2002; Kass 2010), and the Collaborative Normal 
Tension Glaucoma Study Group ( Collaborative N ormal -Tension Glaucoma Study Group 
1998) support the general conclusion that every millimeter of reduction in intraocular 
pressure ( IOP) is significant for delaying disease progression.  This conclusion holds true not 
only for high risk ocular hypertensive and glaucoma subject s with elevated IOPs but also for 
glaucoma subject s with IOPs in the normal range.  Thus the goal for treating subject s should 
be to  lower IOP to the point that it prevents further damage to the optic nerve and achieve 
this without sacrificing safety or convenience.  For many individuals with glaucoma, current 
IOP-lowering  medications are not sufficiently effective as monotherapy to achieve target IOP  
and the majority of glaucoma patients often need more than one drug to reach their target IOP ( Lichter 2001 ).  Increas ing complexity of the dosing re gimen often leads to decreased 
compliance with dosing .  Fixed -dose combination (FDC) products such as Cosopt
® and 
Combigan® Ophthalmic Solutions help simplify dosing regimens by providing two 
medications in a single bottle, but all FDC products marketed in the USA  require twice -daily 
dosing.  An  FDC product that would provide the same efficacy as co -administration of two 
medications with the convenience of once- daily dosing may allow for better compliance from  
these patients . 
Inhibitors of Rho kinase (ROCK) have emerged as a new class of IOP-lowering agents and 
are curren tly being tested in the clinic  (Chen 2011; Kopczynski 2014).  AR -13324 is a novel 
Rho kinase and norepinephrine transporter inhibitor developed at Aerie Pharmaceuticals, Inc 
for topical ophthalmic use for lowering IOP.  In both rabbit and monkey studies, AR-13324 produces large reductions in IOP with a longer duration of action than reported for previously characterized Rho kinase inhibitors.  AR -13324 Ophthalmic Solution has been shown to 
provide significant IOP lowering when dosed once-daily in the evening (Study Report AR-13324-CS202), and reduces IOP potentially through several mechanisms: increasing 
trabecular outflow ( Wang 2014), decreasing aqueous humor production ( Wang 2015), and 
reducing episcleral venous pressure (Kiel 2015).  The ability to reduce aqueous production 
may be related to AR -13324 in vitro inhibitory activity a gainst monoamine transporters, 
including the norepinephrine transporter.

 a fix
ed-dose combination of AR-13324 (0.01% or 0.02%) 
and latanoprost (0.005%) (referred to as PG324 Ophthalmic Solution 0.01% or 0.02% in this 
protocol) dosed once daily (PM) was investigated in a double- masked, parallel -group study 
(Lewis 2015; Clinical Study Report PG324-CS201).  In that study, the fixed-dose 
combination, PG324 0.02% provided clinically relevant  and statistically superior ocular 
hypotensive efficacy relative to its individual active components at the same concentrations (Clinical Study Report PG324-CS201).  The only safety finding of note was transient 
asymptomatic conjunctival hyperemia which was of mild severity approximately 80% of the 
time when it occurred  (Clinical Study Report PG324-CS201). 
The present investigation  is designed to evaluate PG324 in a controlled study compared to 
AR-13324 Ophthalmic Solution 0.02% and latanoprost ophthalmic solution 0.005% in a 
study of 3 months duration. 
1.2 Findings from Nonclinical and Clinical Studies  
Detailed information on nonclinical and clinical studies completed with AR -13324 and 
PG324 is provided in the Investigator’s Brochure .  
1.3 Risks and Benefits to Human Subject s 
As no other fixed dose combinations of this class are approved, and only early stage clinical experience is available, the risks and benefits are not well understood at this time.  Given the 
pharmacology of this class of agents and the results of previous Phase 1 , Phase 2 , and Phase 
3 clinical studies by the Sponsor ( Clinical Study Reports AR-13324-CS101, 
AR-13324-CS201, AR -13324-CS202, AR -13324-CS301, and PG324- CS201 ), it is expected 
that adverse events seen in clinical trials individually with latanoprost- and AR-13324 
containing ophthalmic formulations may  be observed with PG324.  The reader should refer 
to the Investigator’s Brochure  and Appendix 3 for more detailed information on potential 
risks  due to use of AR-13324 and PG324 ophthalmic solutions.  
The major potential benefit from exposure to PG324 is reduction in IOP in subject s with 
open angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension.  A sequela of reduced IOP could be slowing of disease progression and preservation of vision in subjects for longer times when measured over periods of months to years. 
2. STUDY OBJECTIVES  
2.1 Primary  Objective s 
The primary objectives of this study are: 
• To evaluate the ocular hypotensive efficacy of PG324 Ophthalmic Solution relative  to

 • To evaluate the ocular and systemic sa fety of PG324  Ophthalmic Solution over a 
3-month treatment period relative to each of its active components, AR-13324 0.02% and 
latanoprost 0.005% at 08:00, 10:00, and 16:00 hours at Week 2, Week 6, and Month 3 
2.2 Secondary  Objectives  
The secondary objectives  of this study include evaluat ion of: 
• Mean IOP within a treatment group at each post- treatment time point  
• Mean diurnal IOP within a treatment group at each post- treatment visit 
• Mean change from diurnally adjusted baseline IOP at each post -treatment time p oint  
• Mean change from baseline in diurnal IOP at each post -treatment visit  
• Mean percent change from diurnally adjusted baseline IOP at each post -treatment time 
point 
• Mean percent change from baseline in diurnal IOP at each post -treatment visit  
• Percentag es of subjects achieving pre- specified mean, mean change, and percent mean 
change in diurnal IOP levels 
3. INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
3.1 Overall Study Design and Plan 
This is a multi-center, randomized, double-masked, parallel group, active agent-controlled 
study. The study is being conducted to evaluate safety and efficacy of an investigational 
fixed dose combination (FDC) product (PG324 Ophthalmic Solution) for the reduction of 
elevated IOP in subject s with a  diagnosis of open angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension.  In 
accordance with  21 CFR 300.50, the efficacy of the FDC PG324 in this study will be 
assessed relative to the efficacy of each of the pharmacologically active components in 
PG324:  
• AR-13324 Ophthalmic Solution 0.02%  
• Latanoprost ophthalmic solution 0.005%   
Participating subjects who have signed an informed consent form will attend up to 6 study 
visits.  The study duration for a randomiz ed subject  will be approximately 17 weeks  from 
screening (Visit 1) to the last visit (Visit 6 [Day 90 ±3]). Visit 1  will be the Screeni ng Visit 
and will occur up to approximately 28 days  prior to Visit 2.  Visit 2 will be  the first of 2 
qualification visits .  After undergoing a screen ing visit and repeat qualification visits, eligible 
subject s who have met all inclusio n/exclusion criteria will be enrolled and assigned at 
Qualification Visit #2 to one of 3 treatment groups, with group assignment determined by a computer- generated randomization code:  
PG324 Ophthalmic Solution   
Clinical Study Protocol: PG324 -CS30 2, Amendment 1  Aerie Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
 
   
Confidential  Page 19 of 93  
   
 • PG324 Ophthalmic Solution 
• AR-13324 Ophthalmic Solution 0.02% 
• Latanopros t ophthalmic solution 0.005% 
Randomiz ed subject s will return on Week 2, Week 6, and Month 3 for efficacy and safety 
assessments.  Efficacy assessments will focus on careful monitoring of IOP at each study 
visit at three different times (08:00, 10:00, and 16:00 hours) during each of the Week 2, Week 6, and Month 3 study visits .  These data will then be used to evaluate the primary 
efficacy endpoint of mean IOP within a treatment group at 08:00, 10:00, and 16:00 hours evaluated separately at the Week 2, Week 6, and Month 3 study visits , with statistical 
evaluation of each time point within eac h visit modeled separately.   
At each study visit, multiple ocular and systemic safety assessments also will be conducted, 
including some or all of the following: systemic safety assessments (heart rate, blood 
pressure, and clinical laboratory evaluations [including hematology]), pregnancy testing (for women of child bearing potential), ocular symptoms/adverse events, ocular comfort, ETDRS corrected visual acuity, pupil size, objective findings of biomicroscopic examinations (ie, anterior segment examinations including evaluation of cornea, conjunctiva, eyelids, iris , 
anterior chamber  and lens), corneal endothelial cell counts (ECCs) in both eyes by specular 
microscopy (at selected sites),  visual field and cup- disc ratio measurements, and dilated 
ophthalmoscopic examination. 
Approximately 690 subject s will be randomized in this study and will be assigned in a 1:1:1 
ratio to treatment with PG324, AR-13324 0.02% or latanoprost 0.005% ophthalmic solutions. 
All investigational product s will be  instilled  QD as a single drop OU in the evening, 
beginning with the day of Qualification Visit #2.  Significant effort will be made to insure 
adequate masking of all investigational products for both subjects and clinical staff.  All 
doses will be administered by the study subject s.  For subjects deemed unable to self -
administer the doses, a guardian or caregiver will be asked to administer the medication.   
3.2 Rationale for Study Design and Control Group 
In order to best evaluate the contributions of AR-13324 and latanoprost to the ocular 
hypotensive efficacy of PG324  
 a pa rallel  group, double-masked, 
three- arm study design was selected.  The PG324 dose selected for this study is based on a 
recently completed Phase 2 study ( Clinical Study Report PG324-CS201).  The treatment 
period and dosing frequency is selected on the basi s of nonclinical safety studies  with PG324 
and regulatory requirements for demonstration of ocular hypotensive efficacy.   
3.3 Expected Duration of S ubject  Participation 
Subjects on prior hypotensive medications are required to undergo a minimum washout 
period of 5 to 28 days.  All subjects will undergo about 90 days of treatment with the study

 medication.   Treatment duration with investigational product for this study will start on the 
evening of Visit 3 (Qualification Visit #2; Day 1) and end on the evening b efore Visit 6 
(Day  90±3).

5. STUDY TREATMENTS  
5.1 Description of Treatments  
5.1.1 Investigational Product 
• PG324 Ophthalmic Solution is a sterile, isotonic, buffered aqueous solution containing 
AR-13324 (0.02%), latanoprost (0.005%), boric acid, mannitol, w ater for injection, and 
preserved with benzalkonium chloride (0.02%).  The product formulation is adjusted to approximately pH 5.  
5.1.2 Comparator Product  
• Latanoprost ophthalmic solution 0.005% is a sterile, isotonic, buffered aqueous solution 
of latanoprost with a pH of approximately 6.7 and an osmolality of approximately 267 mOsmol/kg. Each mL of latanoprost ophthalmic solution 0.005% contains 50 micrograms of latanoprost.  Benzalkonium chloride, 0.02% is added as a preservative. The inactive ingredients are sodium chloride, sodium dihydrogen phosphate monohydrate, disodium hydrogen phosphate anhydrous, and water for injection. 
• AR-13324 Ophthalmic Solution is a sterile, isotonic, buffered aqueous solution 
containing AR- 13324 (0.02%), boric acid, mannitol, w ater for injection, and preserved 
with benzalkonium chloride (0.015%).  The product formulation is adjusted to approximately pH 5.  
5.2 Treatments Administered   
There will be 3 treatments in  this study:  
• PG324 (AR-13324 0.02% and latanoprost 0.005%) Ophthalmic Solution  
PG324 Ophthalmic Solution   
Clinical Study Protocol: PG324 -CS30 2, Amendment 1  Aerie Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
 
   
Confidential  Page 23 of 93  
   
 • AR-13324 Ophthalmic Solution 0.02% 
• Latanoprost ophthalmic solution 0.005%  
Subject s will be assigned according to a computer -generated randomization list in a 1:1:1  
ratio to PG324 Ophthalmic Solution, AR-13324 Ophthalmic Solution 0.02%, or latanoprost 
ophthalmic solution 0.005% (stratified by investigative site  and by maximum baseline IOP 
[< 25 mmHg vs ≥ 25 mmHg]).  Subject s will instill 1 d rop of study drug into each eye, one 
time per day in the evening, at approximately 24 hour intervals.  Doses will be 
self-administered by the study subjects.  For subject s deemed unable to self -administer the 
doses, a caregiver will be asked to administer the medication. All subject s will administer 
study treatment for approximately 90  days.  
5.3 Selection and Timing of Dose for Each Subject  
The dose of PG324 selected for this study is based upon the positive outcomes seen for 
PG324 in the PG324-CS201 clinical study.  Each investigational product is being dosed QD 
OU (in the evening between 20:00 and 22:00 hours ) in this study to allow for estimated peak 
and trough levels of both AR-13324 and latanoprost to be present in ocular tissue at the assessment timepoints (0800, 1000, 1600).  The treatment period is selected on the basis of nonclinical safety studies  and regulatory requirements in the US for pivotal studies of topical 
IOP-lowering  medications .  
5.4 Method of Assigning Subject s to Treatment Groups  
A randomization code for allocating the treatments will be prepared by an independent biostatistician, who is not involved in the day- to-day conduct of the study.  Subject s will be 
randomized using an IWRS in a 1:1:1  ratio to receive PG324 Ophthalmic Solution, 
AR-13324 Ophthalmic Solution 0.02%, or latanoprost ophthalmic solution 0.005%.   
5.5 Masking  
An independent person at the site who is not responsible for performing any of the study procedures is to be assigned to dispense, collect, and store investigational product  while 
maintaining the masking of the study.   
Study- related site personnel will be cautioned that any used or unused subject kits are not to 
be opened at the clinical site by the site staff involved in efficacy or safety  measurements.   
Treatment assignmen ts will be masked to the Investigator, the clinical study team (Sponsor, 
personnel involved in day to day study management, Data Managers, and Statisticians), and the subject s prior to all subjects completing 3 months of treatment.  T reatment assignment(s)  
will be unmasked and made available to the Investigator and the Sponsor ’s Medical Monitor 
only in case of medical emergency or occurrence of adverse events that in the opinion of the Investigator warrant unmasking .  In the absence of medical need, the ran domization  
code /treatment assignment(s)  will not be available to the above study personnel until after the 
study is completed and the database is locked.   
PG324 Ophthalmic Solution   
Clinical Study Protocol: PG324 -CS30 2, Amendment 1  Aerie Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
 
   
Confidential  Page 24 of 93  
   
 If the Investigator feels it is necessary to unmask a subject ’s treatment assignment in  an 
emergency situation, the Investigator should promptly contact the Sponsor ’s Medical 
Monitor or designee.  A decision will be made as to whether or not the treatment for the 
subject  should be unmasked, preferably after consultation with the Sponsor ’s Medical 
Monitor or designee .  The treatment assignment will be revealed on a subject- by-subject  
basis, thus leaving the masking on remaining subject s intact.   
In an emergency situation in which treatment of an adverse event requires immediate 
unmasking, and the Investigator is unable to promptly contact the Sponsor ’s Medical 
Monitor, the Investigator may unmask the treatment .  The masked portion of the kit label 
may be revealed for the treatment assignment.  In the case of such unmasking in an 
emergency situ ation, the Investigator should contact the Sponsor immediately ther eafter and 
document the unmasking in writing, recording the date, time, and reason for unmasking the 
study drug treatment in the source documentation.  Individual unmasking by the Investiga tor 
will normally result in withdrawal of the subject from the study and should only be performed for the specific subject requiring unmasking of treatment assignment .  
5.6 Concomitant Therapy  
Intermittent use of over-the- counter (OTC) artificial tear lubricant products is acceptable, 
with a minimum of 10 minutes between use of OTC products and study medication.  
However, concurrent therapy with any form of ocular hypotensive medications (prescription or over-the-counter) is not allowed during the study.  Subjects who are not taking any 
concomitant disallowed ocular medication or who do not require washout of ocular hypotensive medication can return as soon as cl inical chemistry and hematology re sults are 
received for Qualification Visit #1 (see Section  7.1.2 of this protocol for more details ). 
Disallowed concomitant ocular medications for randomiz ed subjects include: 
• Miotics  
• Epinephrine-related compounds  
• Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (ocular or systemic)  
• α-adrenoceptor agonists  
• β-adrenoceptor antagonists  
• Muscarinic agonists ( eg, pilocarpine)  
• Prostaglandin analogues  other than that which may be contained in the provided 
investigational product   
• Any cortico steroid -containing systemic drug regardless of route of administration 
PG324 Ophthalmic Solution   
Clinical Study Protocol: PG324 -CS30 2, Amendment 1  Aerie Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
 
   
Confidential  Page 25 of 93  
   
 Systemic therapy with agents that could have an effect on IOP is to be consistent in dose, 
regimen and agent within the 30 days prior to screening and throughout the study.  For 
example, a subject  can be treated with a systemic β-adrenoceptor antagonist as long as the 
particular agent and its dose and regimen had been consistent for the 30 days prior to 
screening, and there is no reason to believe that alteration would be necessary at some point 
later during the study.  PRN use of systemic or inhaled cortico steroid -containing therapies is 
not allowed.  Subjects should be cautioned to avoid use of alcohol during the study visi t days 
and use of drugs such as marijuana . 
Contact lens wear during the study is acceptable.  However, subject s must remove their 
contact lenses at least 30 minutes before instillation of study medication, and not place them in their eye(s) until 30 minutes after instillation.   
Use of all medications should be documented on the appropriate e CRF.  Investigators are 
encouraged to contact the Sponsor for any questions regarding allowed medications.  Judgment of continued study participation by any randomized  subject , and inclusion of this 
subject ’s subsequent visits in the safety and efficacy analysis , will be made by the Sponsor.   
All medications which the subject  has taken within 30 days prior to screening and during the 
study will be recorded in the e CRF.  The name of the drug, dose, route of administration, 
duration of treatment, and indication will be recorded for each medication.  For combination products ( eg, Contac
®), the brand name is required.  For non-combination products, the 
generic name is desired.  Any change in dosing parameters should also be recorded in the eCRF.   
The use of routine ophthalmic diagnostic pharmaceutical agents ( eg, fluorescein and local 
anesthetic) will be allowed and individual documentation is not required.   
5.7 Restrictions  
5.7.1 Prior Therapy  
Individuals currently using ocular hypotensive medications must undergo a minimum washout period as specified in Table 1.  If washout is to be extended beyond 6 weeks (42 days) for logistical or other reasons, the Sponsor should be contacted.  Washout of one 
hypotensive medication prior to study Visit 2 (Qualification Visit #1) and initiation of  a 
second hypotensive medication with a shorter washout period is not permitted .  
5.7.2 Fluid and Food Intake  
There are no general restrictions on fluid or food intake for subjects participating in this 
study.

Clinical Study Protocol: PG324 -CS30 2, Amendment 1  Aerie Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
 
   
Confidential  Page 26 of 93  
   
 5.7.3 Subject Activity Restrictions  
On study visit days during which diurnal IOP measurements are made, subjects may not 
engage in strenuous activity.  Otherwise, there are no restrictions on subject activities during 
their participation in this study.

β-adrenoceptor antagonists  4 weeks  
Adrenergic agonists (including α-agonists such as brimonidine 
and apraclonidine)  2 weeks  
Muscarinic agonists ( eg, pilocarpine), carbonic anhydrase 
inhibitors (topical or oral)  5 days  
Hughes 2005  
5.8 Treatment  Compliance  
All subject s will be instructed on the importance of following the once-daily dosing regimen.  
Dosing should occur in the evening between 20:00 and 22:00 hours.  Intermittent interruption 
of dosing is discouraged, whether initiated by the Investigator or the subject.   Subjects should 
contact the Investigator before interrupting treatment, and Investigators should contact the 
Sponsor. 
 
  
Subject s should be reminded at all visits to dose every evening.  Subject s may optionally use 
a provided Dosing Reminder worksheet or device. 
5.9 Packaging and Labeling 
The container- closure systems for the investigational products are similar ; the 
container -closure system has been chosen to be similar to the latanoprost ophthalmic solution 
0.005% commercial product presentation.  All clinical trial material packers (containing subject kits) and subject kits containing the bottles will be identical in appearance.  Clinical 
supplies of PG324 Ophthalmic Solution and AR-13324 Ophthalmic Solution 0.02% will be in a dropper-dose bottle containing a volume of n o less than 2.5 mL.  A clinical trial material 
packer, which contains multiple subject  kits sufficient for a 3  month supply, will be packaged 
and provided to the site for dispensation to the subject s. Subject  packers therefore contai n 
sufficient  kits for an individual subject  that will be distributed during this study . 
Each packaged unit for US use will be labeled with an investigational label with the 
following minimal information: the study number, kit number, and storage statement,  
including a statement “Caution – New Drug – Limited by Federal (US) Law to 
Investigational Use” or equivalent. A similar set of information in agreement with Canadian 

PG324 Ophthalmic Solution   
Clinical Study Protocol: PG324 -CS30 2, Amendment 1  Aerie Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
 
   
Confidential  Page 27 of 93  
   
 law will be placed on packaged units for Canadian use and all Canadian supplies will be 
labeled in bilingual text (English and French).  
A commercially available and approved generic formulation of latanoprost ophthalmic 
solution 0.005% will be used for this study, with the commercial label removed and replaced 
with an investigational label.  All  investigational product bottles will then be labeled with 
investigational labels  which will be similar in appearance for all treatment groups and will 
contain  the study salient information .  
The cartons used to package individual dropper bottles for all 3 investigational products will 
be identical to ensure adequate masking.  Similarly, the labels applied to the clinical trial material  packers  and kit cartons will be similar  for all 3 investigational products, with the key 
difference being the unique kit number.  
Upon dispensing of a clinical trial kit to a subject, a portion of the kit label will be affixed to 
the designated study drug kit label log which will be part of the study files at the individual study site.   
5.10 Storage and Accountability  
The investigational products should be stored refrigerated (2°C to 8°C/36°F to 46°F) until 
provided to the subject . The subject should be instructed that, once an investigational product 
bottle is opened, the product may be kept refrigerated or at room temperature (up to 25°C/77°F) for up to 4 weeks while continuing to store the bottle in the carton.  Temporary temperature excursions up to 30°C are permissible.  Subjects should be instructed not to  
freeze the product and to protect it from light (store it in the carton) .  Prior to dispensing to 
the subject , all investigational material must be stored in a secure location at the 
recommended long-term storage condition (2°C to 8°C) with strictly limited access documented by signature of authorized persons who may dispense investigational product. 
5.11 Investigational Product Accountability  at Study Site    
5.11.1 Receipt and Disposition of S tudy Medication   
Investigational product will be shipped to the Investigator’s site from a central depot.  
A study staff me mber at the Investigator’s site who is not involved in conducting any 
efficacy or safety procedures will verify study medication shipment records by comparing the 
shipping documentation accompanying the study medication to the study medication actually received at the Investigator’s site.  If a discrepancy is noted, the appropriate individual at the Sponsor or designee must be notified immediately.  The responsible person for dispensing study medication at the Investigator’s site  is the only site staff member permitted to  distribute 
investigational product and also has sole responsibility to account for all returned used, 
partially used and unused bottles and kits of investigational products.  The investigational product(s) must not be used outside this protocol.  A Drug Accountability Log will be kept at 
the clinical site .

Confidential  Page 28 of 93  
   
 5.11.2 Return of Study Medication  
When the study is completed or is terminated by the Sponsor, all study material including 
used and unused study medication kits will be returned to the Sponsor or their designee.  
Subjects should be instructed to retain all bottles (used or unused) of study medication and return them to the clinical site.  All study medication accounting procedures must be 
completed before the study is considered to be concluded.  The responsible person at the Investigator’s site  has the sole responsibility to account for all used, partially used, and 
unused bottles of investigational products.  This  site staff member at the Investigator’s site  
will complete a study drug returns form or equivalent that will be signed by the Investigator or designee prior to returning the used and unused study medication kits and bottles to the Sponsor or their designee.  
6. STUDY PROCEDURES  
Please see Appendix 1 for schedule of visits and procedures and Appendix 2 for detailed 
description of study procedures.  
6.1 Informed Consent  
Prior to any study procedures, the study will be discussed with each potential subject  and 
subject s wishing to participate must give written informed consent.  The verbal explanation 
of the study will cover all the elements specified in the written information provided for the 
subject .  The Investigator will inform the subject  of the aims, methods, anticipated benefits 
and potential hazards of the study, including any discomfort it may entail.  The subject  must 
be given every opportunity to clarify any points he/she does not understand and, if necessary, 
may ask for more information.  At the end of the interview, the subject should be given time to reflect.  Subjects and/or legal ly authorized representative then will be required to sign and 
date the informed consent form.   
The informed consent form must have received approval/favorable review by a properly 
constituted IRB/IEC prior to use.  A copy of the signed and dated consent document will be given to ea ch subject.  The original signed and dated informed consent document must be 
maintained in the study files at the Investigat or’s site.   
The Investigator or staff is responsible for ensuring that no subject  is subject to any 
study- related examination or activity before th e subject  has given written informed consent.  
It should be emphasized that the subject  is at liberty to withdraw consent to participate at any 
time, without penalty or loss of benefits to which the subject  is otherwise entitled.  Subject s 
who refuse to give, or withdraw, written informed consent may not be included or continued in this study, and  should be notified that discontinuation from the study will not impact on 
their subsequent care.   
6.2 Demographics and Medical History  
Demographic dat a and any ongoing medication  use will be collected and recorded.  Any 
medications the subject  took but discontinued within the 30 days prior to screening also will

Clinical Study Protocol: PG324 -CS30 2, Amendment 1  Aerie Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
 
   
Confidential  Page 29 of 93  
   
 be recorded.  Significant medical history will be collected  and any current underlying 
medical conditions, including those that began within the last 30 days and which may have 
resolved before screening, additionally must be recorded.   
6.3 Dispensing Investigational Product 
Study- related site personnel will be cautioned that any used or unused subject kits are not to 
be opened at the clinical site by the site staff involved in efficacy or safety measurements.  
Study staff responsible for dispensing investigational product will be listed on the Delegation 
of Responsibilities log.  When a subject meets all criteria for selection and has completed all screening assessments, the subject will be assigned to a treatment according to the IWRS.  
The responsible study staff will account for all used and unused investigation product packers and their kit c ontents by maintaining a Drug Accountability log.   
6.4 Appropriateness of Measurements  
The ophthalmic and systemic measures used in this study are consistent with standard of care.  In particular, intraocular pressure (IOP) as measured by Goldmann applanation  
tonometry, the primary efficacy assessment in this study, is accepted worldwide as a standard for testing of pharmacologically  active agents intended to lower elevated  IOP. 
6.5 Efficacy Assessments  
6.5.1 Specification of the Efficacy Parameters   
The primary efficac y outcome will be the comparison of PG324 Ophthalmic Solution relative 
to each of its active components, AR-13324, 0.02% and latanoprost 0.005%, for the mean IOP within a treatment group at 08:00, 10:00, and 16:00 hours at the Week 2, Week 6, and Month 3 s tudy visits.  A description of the method for measuring IOP to be used in this study 
is contained in Appendix 2. 
Secondary efficacy outcomes will include a summary of the following comparisons of 
PG324 Ophthalmic Solution relative to each of its active components (AR-13324 0.02% and latanoprost 0.005%) for: 
• Mean IOP within a treatment group at each post- treatment time point  
• Mean diurnal IOP within a treatment group at each post- treatment visit 
• Mean change from diurnally adjusted baseline IOP at each post -treatment time point  
• Mean change from baseline in diurnal IOP at each post -treatment visit  
• Mean percent change from diurnally adjusted baseline IOP at each post- treatment time 
point 
• Mean percent change from baseline in diurnal IOP at each post -treatment visit  
PG324 Ophthalmic Solution   
Clinical Study Protocol: PG324 -CS30 2, Amendment 1  Aerie Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
 
   
Confidential  Page 30 of 93  
   
 • Percentages of subjects achieving pre- specified mean, mean change, and percent mean 
change in diurnal IOP levels  
Other secondary efficacy analyses will be carried out as described in the study Statistical 
Analysis Plan.  
6.5.2 Method and Timing for Assessing Efficacy Parameters 
As detailed in the following sections and in the schedule of visits and procedure s in 
Appendix 1 describing each study visit, IOP will be measured at a screening visit, at 2 qualification visits after washout of any ocular hypotensive medications as required, and frequently throughout the study.   
6.6 Assessment of Safety  
The assessment of systemic and ocular safety is a primary objective of this study.   
Systemic safety will be assessed for subjects by:  
• Measurements of heart rate, blood pressure, and collection of clinical laboratory findings 
(including hematology and clinical chemistry ) (see Sections  6.7.1, 6.7.2, and 6.8.1)  
• Pregnancy testing (see Section  6.8.2)  
The primary ocular safety assessments in both eyes of randomiz ed subjects will be:  
• Ocular symptoms/adverse event s 
• Ocular comfort (tolerability) test  
• ETDRS best corrected visual acuity  
• Pupil size 
• Objective findings of biomicroscopic examinations (ie, anterior segment examinations including evaluation of cornea, conjunctiva, lids, and lens)  
• Pachymetry and gonioscopy  
• Corneal  endothelial cell counts by specular microscopy at selected sites  
• Visual field and cup- disc ratio measurements  
• Dilated ophthalmoscopy

Confidential  Page 31 of 93  
   
 6.7 Vital Signs  
6.7.1 Heart Rate  
Subject heart rate will be measured at screening, and at 08:00 hours (±30 minutes) during 
each subsequent study visit attended by the subject.  Heart rate will be determined only once during each study visit by the method described in Appendix 2.  
6.7.2 Blood Pressure  
Blood pressure will be measured once for each subject after the subject heart rate has been determined.  Blood pressure will be determined only once during each study visit by the method described in Appendix 2. 
6.8 Clinical Laboratory Tests 
6.8.1 Laboratory Parameters  
Clinical laboratory tests will include a panel of clinical chemistry assessments and a 
complete blood count (hematology and differentials) as described in Appendix 2. 
6.8.2 Pregnancy Testing  
A urine hCG (human chori onic gonadotropin) pregnancy test (only for females who are not 
diagnosed as postmenopausal or surgically sterile) will be used in this study and performed at 
the screening visit to immediately confirm non -pregnancy eligibility for females of child -
bearing  potential.   
The Sponsor will provide urine pregnancy test s to the sites.  Expiration dates on the 
pregnancy test s will be reviewed and confirmed by the site prior to use. 
If a female becomes pregnant during the study, the Investigator should notify the Sponsor immediately after the pregnancy is confirmed and the subject will be exited from the study.  The Investigator should follow the progress of the pregnancy until the fetus is carried to term.    
6.9 Adverse Event Assessments  and Ocular Safety  
6.9.1 Performing A dverse Events Assessments  
Qualified study staff responsible for assessing adverse events ( AEs) will be listed on the Site 
Signature/ Delegation of Responsibilities Log.  This includes assessment of AE severity and 
relationship to investigational product.  AE information may be volunteered by the subject or 
solicited by study personnel through non- leading questions. 
All treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs) occurring during the study, regardless of the 
assumption of causal relationship, must be documented on the respective eCRF.  Adverse events should be documented from the time the subject  receives the first dose of 
Investigational P roduct until the subject ’s participation in the study has been completed.  If a 
PG324 Ophthalmic Solution   
Clinical Study Protocol: PG324 -CS30 2, Amendment 1  Aerie Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
 
   
Confidential  Page 32 of 93  
   
 subject  has an ongoing adverse event at the time of study completion, the ongoing adverse 
event must be followed-up and provided appropriate medical care until the event has 
resolved or stabilized.   
Documentation of adverse events/adverse reactions includes start date and stop date, severity, action(s) taken, seriousness and outcome.   
6.9.2 Adverse Event Definitions  
The following definitions of terms apply to this section: 
• Adverse event:  any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in 
humans, whether or not considered drug related.   
• Life-threatening adverse event or life- threatening suspected adverse reaction:  an adverse 
event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “life- threatening” if, in the view of 
either the Investigator or Sponsor, its occurrence places the subject at immediate risk of 
death.  It does not include an adverse event or suspected adverse reaction that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.   
• Serious adverse event (SAE) or serious suspected adverse reaction  (SSAR) :  an adverse 
event or suspected adverse reaction is considered ‘‘serious’’ if, in the view of either the Investigator or Sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes: Death, a life -
threatening or sight-threatening adverse event, in subject hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, a persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions, or a congenital anomaly/birth defect.  Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospitalization may be considered serious when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardi ze the subject  and may require medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.  Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in subject  
hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 
• Suspected adverse reaction:  any adverse event for which there is a reasonable possibility 
that the drug caused the adverse event.  For the purposes of IND safety reporting, ‘‘reasonable possibility’’ means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the adverse event.  Suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser degree of certainty about causality than adverse reaction, which means any adverse event caused by a drug.   
• Unexpected adverse event or unexpected suspected adverse reaction:  an adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered ‘‘unexpected’’ if it is not listed in the Investigator ’s Brochu re or is not listed at the specificity or severity that has been 
observed.  For example, under this definition, hepatic necrosis would be unexpected (by virtue of greater severity) if the Investigator ’s Brochure  referred only to elevated hepatic 
enzymes or hepatitis.  Similarly, cerebral thromboembolism and cerebral vasculitis would 
PG324 Ophthalmic Solution   
Clinical Study Protocol: PG324 -CS30 2, Amendment 1  Aerie Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
 
   
Confidential  Page 33 of 93  
   
 be unexpected (by virtue of greater specificity) if the Investigator ’s Brochure  listed only 
cerebral vascular accidents.  “Unexpected,” as used in this definition, also refers to 
adverse events or suspected adverse reactions that are mentioned in the Investigator ’s 
Brochure  as occurring with a class of drugs or as anticipated from the pharmacological 
properties of the drug, but are not specifically mentioned as occurring with the particular drug under investigation. 
Note: Any medical condition present prior to administration of the masked study medication which remains unchanged or improved should not be recorded as an adverse event at subsequent visits. 
Note: If an event occurs during the washout period ( if washout of prior ocular  hypotensive 
medication is needed) , prior to subject  enrollment and the commencement of study 
medication, it should be recorded as part of the Medical History and not as an adverse event.  
As noted in Section  7.1.2, any change in their Visit 1 (S creening)  health status should be 
recorded on the Medical History page of the e CRF (eg , the subject  has been diagnosed with 
cancer).  
Note: In the present study, Investigators are asked to use the verbatim term  “conjunctival 
hyperemia” on the study AE form to describe observations of conjunctival redness  if the  
ocular redness observation is increased from Visit 1 (screening) observations and clinically 
meaningful.  Investigators are also asked to note all observations of conjunctival hyperemia on the biomicroscopy eCRF as well as on the study AE form.     
6.9.3 Timing  for Reporting of Adverse Events  
The TEAEs occurring during the study must be documented, regardless of the assumption of 
a causal relationship.  TEAEs should be documented from the time the subject  receives the 
first dose of investigational product until subject  participation in the study has been 
completed.  If a subject  has one or more ongoing TEAEs at the time of study completion, the 
subject  must be followed and provided appropriate medical care until the sign(s) and/or 
symptoms(s) of the AE have remitted or stabilized in the opinion of the Investigator. 
When recording a TEAE, the following information should be provided on the study AE 
eCRF:  
1. Action Taken with Study Drug:  
• None 
• Investigational Product Discontinued 
• Investigational Product Interrupted 
2. Other Action Taken:  
• None 
PG324 Ophthalmic Solution   
Clinical Study Protocol: PG324 -CS30 2, Amendment 1  Aerie Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
 
   
Confidential  Page 34 of 93  
   
 • Non-Drug Therapy  
• New OTC or Rx Drug Added  
• Hospitalized less than 24 hours 
• Hospitalized greater than or equal to 24 hours 
3. Outcome of an adverse event is to be coded as: 
• Fatal  
• Not Recovered/Not Resolved 
• Recovered/Resolved  
• Recovered/Resolved with sequelae  
• Recovering/Resolving 
• Unknown/Lost to follow-up 
6.9.4 Severity  
Severity of an adverse event is defined as a qualitative assessment of the level of discomfort 
or the degree of intensity of an adverse event as determined by the Investigator or reported to him/her by the subject .  The assessment of severity is made irrespective of study medication 
relationship or seriousness of the event and should be evaluated according to the following scale:  
• 1 = Mild:  present and noticeable, but not distressing, and no disruption of normal daily activities  
• 2 = Moderate:  bothersome, discomfort sufficient to possibly reduce or affect normal daily activity  
• 3 = Severe: incapacitating, with inability to work or perform normal daily activity  
A change in  severity for a reported AE will require a stop date for the previous severity and a 
new start and stop date for the new severity.  For example, a change in severity may go from mild to severe, or from severe to moderate.  In either case, the start and stop dates should be recorded.   
Please note: a severe AE is not the same as a serious AE.  Seriousness of an AE (NOT severity) serves as a guide for defining regulatory reporting obligations (see Section  6.9.9 for 
further information on serious AEs [SAEs]) .

Confidential  Page 35 of 93  
   
 6.9.5 Relationship  
The study medication relationship for each adverse event/adverse reaction should be 
determined by the Invest igator using these explanations: 
• Not Relat ed:  The event is clearly related to other factors such as subject ’s clinical 
condition, therapeutic interventions, concomitant disease or therapy administered to the subject  and does not follow a known response pattern to the product. 
• Unlikely Related : The event is most probably caused by other etiologies such as 
participant’s underlying condition, therapeutic intervention, or concomitant therapy; or the delay between administration and the onset of the AE is incompatible with a causal relationship. Therefore, there is not a reasonable possibility that the AE was caused by the study medication.  
• Possibly Related :  The event follows a reasonable, temporal sequence from the time of 
study medication administration and/or follows a known response pattern to the study medication, but could have been produced by other factors such as the subject ’s clinical 
state, therapeutic interventions or concomitant therapy administered to the subject . 
• Related :  The event follows a reasonable, temporal sequence from the time of study 
medication administration and/or follows a known response pattern to the study medication and cannot be reasonably explained by other factors such as subject ’s clinical 
state, therapeutic interventions or concomitant therapy administered to the subject , and 
either occurs immediately following study medication administration, or improves on stopping the study medication, or reappears on repeat exposure, or there is a positive reaction at the application site.  
6.9.6 Expectedness  
For AR -13324, the most frequently reported AE in 3 Phase 2 and one Phase 3 studies 
(Clinical Study Reports AR-13324-CS201, AR -13324-CS202, PG324-CS201, and 
AR-13324-CS301) has been conjunctival hyperemia.  Other AEs seen in significantly greater 
frequency with AR-13324 than in act ive control treatment arms in these studies include 
instillation site erythema or pain, eyelid erythema, conjunctival hemorrhage, conjunctival 
vascular disorder , blurred vision, corneal deposits, eye irritation, increased lacrimation, and 
foreign body sensation. 
The most common AEs seen with latanoprost ophthalmic solution 0.005% in clinical trials as 
reported in the latanoprost prescribing information  (Appendix 3) include conjunctival 
hyperemia, eyelash changes, increased  iris pigmentation, eyelid skin darkening, macular 
edema (including cystoid macular edema), and intraocular inflammation (iritis/uveitis).  
An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered “unexpected” if it is not listed in the Investigator’s Brochure or is not listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed.  “Unexpected,” as used in this definition, also refers to adver se events or suspected adverse 
reactions that are mentioned in the Investiga tor’s Brochure  as occurring with this class of 
PG324 Ophthalmic Solution   
Clinical Study Protocol: PG324 -CS30 2, Amendment 1  Aerie Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
 
   
Confidential  Page 36 of 93  
   
 drugs or as anticipated from the pharmacological properties of AR-13324 or latanoprost, and 
are not specifically mentioned as occurri ng with the investigational product.  The AEs that 
are both unexpected and serious should be reported in an expedited fashion to the Sponsor (see Section  6.9.10 for further details).  
6.9.7 Clinical Significance  
Determination of whether a finding is clinically significant will be made by the Principal Investigator or the Sub-Investigator and will be documented on the e CRF . 
6.9.8 Clinical Laboratory Adverse Events 
Clinical laboratory values (other than pregnancy tests results) that are noted as abnormal and 
clinically significant at study exit and that are changes from Visit 1 (screening) values will be document ed as AEs . 
6.9.9 Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) or Serious Suspected Adverse Reactions  
6.9.9.1 Reporting Serious Adverse Events 
An investigator must immediately report any SAE or SSAR  (see Section  6.9.2 for 
definitions) to the Sponsor or Rho Product Safety, the Sponsor CRO representative, whether 
or not the SAE or SSAR is considered drug-related, including those listed in the protocol or 
Investigator ’s Brochure .  The investigator report must include an assessment of whether there 
is a reasonable possibility that the drug caused the event.  The Investigator must report any SAE or SSAR that occurs during the study for a subject  or any SAE or SSAR that occurs 
within 4 weeks (ie, 30 days) af ter the last administration of IP. Study endpoints that are 
serious adverse events ( eg, all-cause mortality) must be reported in accordance with the 
protocol unless there is evidence suggesting a causal relationship between the drug and the event ( eg, deat h from anaphylaxis).  In that case, the Investigator must immediately report 
the event to the Sponsor.  The investigator must record non-serious adverse events and report them to the Sponsor according to the timetable for reporting specified in the protocol.  In case of incomplete information, the Investigator must provide follow-up information as soon as possible, again using the SAE report form.   
In addition, in the case of immediately life -threatening AEs or AEs with fatal outcome, or 
adverse events that are serious, unexpected (ie, not in the Investigator’s Brochure) and 
judged related to the investigational product, the Investigator must inform the Sponsor 
representative (Rho Product Safety) by phone within 24 hours of notification  or occurrence 
of the SAE.  
Pregnancies occurring in subjects enrolled in the study or in their partners must be reported and followed to outcome. While pregnancy itself is not considered to be an AE or SAE, pregnancy reports are tracked by Rho Product Safety.  Premature terminations including miscarriage, spontaneous abortion, or elective termination of a pregnancy for medical reasons will be reported as an SAE.  Other pregnancy complications should be reported as SAEs, if they meet serious criteria.  Should the pregnancy result in a congenital anomaly or

 birth defect, a separate SAE report must be submitted.  Furthermore, all neonatal deaths that 
occur within 30 days of the birth should be re ported as SAEs, without regard to causality.   
The Investigator must complete the pregnancy report form and fax or email the form to Rho 
Product Safety within one business day of knowledge of the pregnancy. Following delivery 
or termination of pregnancy, the pregnancy repo rt form is to be completed and submitted by 
fax or email to Rho Product Safety. 
Pregnancies occurring up to 30 days after th e last administration of  study drug are to be 
reported.   SAEs must be reported to the IRB/IEC according to the IRB/IEC requirements. 
Important : The Investigator must re port an SAE or SSAR occurring at his/her site to the 
Sponsor and IRB/IEC, rega rdless of causality.

6.9.10 Serious Unexpected Suspected Adverse Reactions (SUSARs) 
6.9.10.1 Reporting Serious Unexpected Suspected Adverse Reactions 
 
The Investigator must immediately report se rious unexpected suspected adverse reactions 
(SUSARs) that occur or are observed during the course of the study or within 4 weeks 
(ie, 30 days) of the last administ ration of investigationa l product to a subject .  In the event of 
a SUSAR, the site must notify Rho Product Safety (contact information in Section 6.9.9.1) 
using the SAE report form within 24 hours of no tification, observation, or occurrence of the 
SUSAR, whether or not comple te information is available. In the case of incomplete 
information, the Investigator must provide follow-up information as soon as possible using the SAE report form.  Rho Product Safety will notify the Sponsor and/or the Sponsor Medical Monitor within 24 hours of knowledge of the event: 
 Sponsor Contact Telephone Number:   
Sponsor Medical Monitor Telephone Number :   
 
 Reports will be evaluated by the Medical Moni tor/Sponsor.  The IRB/IEC and Investigators 
at other study sites will be informed as required. 
6.9.11 Follow-up of Subjects after Adverse Events 
If an adverse event or adverse reaction occurs, the Investigator will institute support and/or 
treatment as deemed appropriate.  If a non- serious adverse event/a dverse reaction is 
unresolved at the time of the last visit, effo rts will be made to follow up until the adverse 

PG324 Ophthalmic Solution  
Clinical Study Protocol: PG324 -CS30 2, Amendment 1  Aerie Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
Confidential  Page 38 of 93 event/adverse reaction  is resolved or stabilized, the subject  is lost to follow -up, or there is 
other resolution to the event.  
6.10 Comfort (Tolerability) Test 
Individuals will be asked “Did you experience any discomfort when placing the drops in your 
eyes?”  This will refer to the study medication use d the previous evening. The response will 
be scored as None, Mild, Moderate or Severe.   
6.11 Best Corrected Visual Acuity  (BCVA)  
Best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) will be taken at visits as a measure of ocular function  
and will be measured at screening and frequently throughout the study. Visual acuity will be 
measured using ETDRS charts or their equivalents.  Accepted charts are those designed according to the principles described by Ferris and coworkers  (Ferris 1982 ) and supported by 
the guidelines from the Eye Care Technology Forum ( Ferris 1996).  
See Appendix 2 for details of the procedures to be followed when determining BCVA .  
6.12 Pupil Size 
Pupil size (ie, diameter ) will be measured prior to dilation with a ruler to the nearest 0.5 mm 
in ambient room light.  
6.13 Biomicroscopy  
Biomicroscopic examina tion of the eyelids, conjunctiva, cornea, anterior chamber, lens, iris, 
and pupil of both eyes will be carried out at every study visit.  Normal or abnormal status of 
these ocular tissues will be graded as described in Appendix 2.  
6.14 Goniosc
opy/Pachymetry 
Gonioscopy will be used to confirm the iridoc orneal angle is open and to what extent.  
Eligible s ubjects must have an angle of 3 or 4 (S haffe r grading scale ; Kolker 1976) for 
pa
rticipation  
in the  study.  Pachy metry w ill be used t o measure the thickness of  the central 
cornea
.  Both of these assessments will be done i n order to de termine  the e ligibility of  a 
subject to be enrolled in this study.  Further information on these procedures is found in 
Appendix 2. 
6.15 Visual 
Field Testing  
Visual field  testing  must be performed prior to randomization and at selected subsequent 
visit(s). Visual fields must be determined as automated threshold perimetry  (eg, 30-2 or 24-2 
Humphrey).  SITA Standard is preferred, SITA fast also is allowed.  Visual fields must be reliable, defined as those with a) fixation losses less than or equal to 33%, b) false positives less than or equal to 33%, and c) false negatives less than or equal to 33%. 
PG324 Ophthalmic Solution   
Clinical Study Protocol: PG324 -CS30 2, Amendment 1  Aerie Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
 
   
Confidential  Page 39 of 93  
   
 For the visual field test required at study entry: 
• In order for an individual to enter the study, unreliable entry visual fields (excessive 
fixation losses, false negatives or false positives) must be repeated until they meet the above criteria  
• They may have been performed within three months prior to randomization, given that they meet the above requirements  
 
6.16 Corneal  Endothelial Cell Counts by Specular Microscopy (Selected Sites)  
All subjects at suitably equipped selected clinical sites who agree to participate in the stud y 
will have non-cont act specular microscope images of their central corneal  endothelium 
obtained for the study eye at Visit 1  (Screening)  and at Visit 6.0  (Day 90), up to 
approximately 350 randomiz ed subjects .  This limit ensures that at least 100 subjects  in the 
PG324 treatment arm will have ECC results at Visit 1 and Visit 6.0 .  Non -contact specular 
microscopy is preferred because it does not require the use of a local anesthetic ( McCarey 
2008).  Three digital images will be taken for the study by a trained technician  at a clinical 
site.  These images will be forwarded to and processed by a central reading center for 
determination of central corneal  endothelial cell  counts.  Procedures to be followed in 
recording and transferring specular microscope images will be provided in the Reading Center Manual by the central reading center .  See Appendix 2 for further information.  
6.17 Dilated Ophthalm oscopy 
A dilated funduscopic examination including evaluation of the retina , vitreous , macula, 
choroid, optic nerve, and cup/disc ratio will be performed.  See Appendix 2 for further information on scoring.  Evaluation of cup-disc ratio will be performed when ophthalmoscopy is performed.   
6.18 Remo val of Subject s from the Study or Investigational Product 
6.18.1 Completed subject  
A completed subject  is defined as one who completes all 3 months (90 days)  of planned 
participation.   6.18.2 Non-completing subject  
A non- completing subject is defined as one who exits the study by their own volition or at 
the discretion of the Investigator, the Medical Monitor, and/or the Sponsor Safety Officer.  
Any subject may decide to voluntarily withdraw from the study at any time without 
prejudice.  In the event that discontinuation of treatment is necessary, the Investigator will 
make every attempt to complete all subsequent safety assessments  listed for Visit 6.0 
(Day  90) as well as a dilated ophthalmo scopy examination.

 The subject  may be discontinued from the study for any of the following reasons: 
• Adverse Events (adverse events including, in the opinion of the investigator,  clinically 
relevant laboratory abnormalities and intercurrent diseases reported by the subject or 
observed by the investigator with documentation on the e CRF)   
• Withdrawal of consent  
• Non-compliance (eg, non-adherence to scheduled follow-up visits or non- compliance 
with dosing) 
• Lost to follow- up 
• Lack of efficacy  (as demonstrated by IOP measurements  and investigator decision that 
there is a risk of additional glaucomatous damage if the subject  continues in the study)  
• Disallowed concurrent medication  
• Investigator decision 
• Protocol violation 
• Death  
• Other 
6.18.3 Actions after Discontinuation 
All subjects who discontinue study participation  due to a report of an AE must be followed-
up and provided appropriate medical care until their signs and symptoms have remitted or stabilized or until clinically meaningful  abnormal laboratory findings have returned to 
acceptable or pre- study limits.  
For subject s who choose to withdraw consent or who are discontinued for non- complian ce 
prior to completing the study, every possible effort should be made by the Investigator to assure there is a final visit that includes all examinations listed for Visit 6.0 (Day 90) a s well 
as a dilated ophthalmoscopy examination .   
6.18.4 Discontinuation of the Entire Study  
The entire study may be discontinued at a given site (by the Investigator or the Sponsor) or at all sites (by the Sponsor).  Prompt, written notice of reasonable cause to all  other relevant  
parties  (Sponsor or Investigator) is required.  Prompt notice to t he IRB /IEC  and to regulatory 
authorities is also required.

 6.18.5 Completed study  
The study is complete d when the planned enrollment has been completed, and all randomiz ed 
subject s have completed the study.  The Sponsor and their designated representative will be 
in communication with investigational sites regarding completion of enrollment and the in-
life portion of  the study.   
7. STUDY ACTIVITIES  
The schedule of s tudy visits and procedures is  shown in  Appendix 1.  
7.1 Study Visits  
7.1.1 Visit 1 (Screening Visit)  
This visit may occur at any time of the day.   
A member of the Investigator’s staff will interview the individual as to their qualifications for 
participation in the study.  Individuals will be asked to review the informed consent, discuss 
issues as needed, and to sign the form.  Significant  medical and ophthalmic history including 
systemic and ocular medication use will be taken, and demographic measures recorded  (see 
Section  6.2).  An examination will be conducted, including measurement of heart rate and 
blood pressure, a urine pregnancy test (for females of childbearing potential), collection of a 
blood sample for clinical laboratory assessments, non- contact sp ecular microscopy (both 
eyes)  at selected study sites , and an ophthalmic examination to include symptoms, best 
corrected visual acuity (BCVA), intraocu lar pressure (before pupil dilation), biomicroscopy, 
gonioscopy, central corneal thickness by ultrasound pachymetry, visual field testing, and 
dilated ophthalmoscopy.  Gonioscopy and visual fields may be assessed  up to three months 
(ie, within 90 days) pri or to randomization.  If assessment of visual fields requires dilation 
due to subject small pupils, visual field testing should not take place within 48 hours of Visit 
2 (Qualification Visit #1).  
Pachymetry must be assessed  at screening Visit 1 or within one week of Visit 1 .  The results 
of blood work should be reviewed after this study visit in order to determine eligibility of the 
subject  prior to undertaking the examination at Visit 2 (Q ualification Visit #1).  For subject s 
who are unable or unwilling to have blood drawn for clinical labs at Visit 1 (screening), the 
blood sample may be drawn at Visit 2 (Qualification Visit #1) so long as the results of the clinical labs are available for that subject  prior to Visit 3 (Qualification Visit #2).  
All females  of childbearing potential must have a negative urine pregnancy test result at the 
screening examination and must not intend to become pregnant during the study. 
The Investigator will evaluate the results of these examinations for possible enrollment of th e 
individual into the study.  All individuals who are qualified for enrollment at this study visit 
should undergo a washout period (if washout is needed) as noted in Section  5.7.1 and will be 
asked to return for Visit 2 (Qualification Visit #1) .

 7.1.1.1 Evaluation of eye-drop instillation performance 
Subject s (or a legally authorized representative for subjects deemed unable to self -
administer) will be provided a bottle of commercially available, multi-dose, over-the-counter 
artificial tears in a room with access to water and soap.  Medication instiller will be asked to instill a drop of the artificial tear in each eye under the observation of a member of the investigator’s  staff after washing hands.  The staff will observe the subject or representative 
to assure that they instill one drop of the artificial tear into each eye, without touching the tip of the bottle to their eye or face ( Stone 2009).  The staff member may work with the 
individual to improve their delivery technique to meet this standard.  If the instiller (or  
representative) cannot demonstrate proper delivery of the eye drop, or if staff member feels that the individual will be unable to do so consistently, then the subject will be excluded from further study participation.   
7.1.1.2 Washout 
As noted in Section  5.7.1, a washout period is required for individuals currently using ocular 
hypotensive medications.  The Investigator is encouraged to have interim visits during the 
washout period (if washout  is needed) for IOP measurement s for individuals to  whom a 
washout period may be a risk for further glaucomatous progression.  
7.1.2 Visit 2 (Qualifying Visit #1, for 08:00 hours IOP measurement) 
After the washout, if required, individuals will return to the Investigator’s office in the early 
morning.  For individuals not requiring washout of ocular hypotensive medication, this visit should take place at least one day and no later than 28 days subsequent to the screening visit.  The subject  will be questioned regarding any changes in their health or concomitant 
medication use.  Any change in the individual’s Visit 1  health status or use of concomitant 
medications should be recorded on the Medical History page of the e CRF (eg, the subject  has 
been diagnosed with cancer) .  Inclusion/exclusion criteria will be reviewed again for the 
potential subjects , and the subject ’s heart rate and blood pressure will be measured.  Results 
of the clinical laboratory tests from Visit 1 need to be available, and reviewed by the Investigat or. For subjects who were unable or unwilling to have blood drawn for clinical labs 
at Visit 1, the blood sample may be drawn at Visit 2 (Qualification Visit #1) so long as the results of the clinical labs are available for that subject prior to Visit3 (Qualification Visit #2). 
The following procedures then will be performed: 
• Symptomatology: Individuals will be asked “How are you feeling?”  
• Best Corrected Visual Acuity  
• IOP and biomicroscopy measurements will be assessed   
o IOP must be measured within 30 minutes of the nominal time (ie, 07:30 to 
08:30 hours)

 o IOP measurements:  Unmedicated (post- washout) IOP > 20 mmHg and  
< 36 mmHg in both eyes at this qualification visit at 08:00 hour is required. 
This is the first of four qualifying IOPs for randomization .  Individuals 
who do NOT  meet this requirement may return for up to 2 additional 
(unscheduled) qualification visits within 1 week of failing this qualification 
visit.  Individuals returning at an unscheduled visit within 1 week are required 
to only re- measure IOP in both eyes.  Individuals who screen fail due to IOP 
being ≥ 36 mmHg in either eye at  this study visit or at an unscheduled visit 
within 1 week of the original visit MAY NOT  return for additional 
qualification visits  and are to be exited from the study.   
Qualified individuals who have met all criteria at this study visit will be scheduled to return 
2-7 days later for the second qualification visit.   
7.1.3 Visit 3.0 (Qualifying Visit #2 [Day 1] for IOP measurement at 08:00 hours)  
Within 2 to 7 days after Visit 2, individuals will return to the Investigator’s office for the next 08:00 hour IOP measurement.  The results of the clinical laboratory tests from Visit 1 or Visit 2 need to be available, and reviewed by the Investigator.  In order for the individual to 
be enroll ed at a subsequent visit, the tests CANNOT be indicative of any clinically 
significant disease in the opinion of the Investigator.  The subject  will be questioned 
regarding any changes in their health or conco mitant medication use.  Any change in the 
individual’s health relative to their Visit 1 (screening)  or Visit 2 health status and 
concomitant medication use should be recorded on the Medical History page of the e CRF 
(eg, the subject  has been diagnosed with cancer).  Inclusion/exclusion criteria will be 
reviewed again for the qualified individual.   
The following procedures will be performed: 
• Symptomatology: Individuals will be asked “How are you feeling?” 
• Heart rate and blood pressure 
• Best Corrected Visual Acuity  
• Pupil size ( diameter ), IOP and biomicroscopy measurements will be assessed    
o IOP must be measured within 30 minutes of the nominal time (ie, 07:30 to 08:30 hours) 
o IOP measurements:  Unmedicated (post- washout) IOP > 20mmHg and < 36 
mmHg in both eyes at this study visit at 08:00 hour is required. This is the 
second of four qualifying IOPs for randomization .   
Qualified individuals will continue with the measurements of IOP at 10:00 hours and 16:00 hours on the day of this study visit.  Individuals who do NOT  meet th e above IOP  
requirement in both eyes may return for up to 2 additional (unscheduled) qualification visits

 within 1 week of failing this qualification visit.  Individuals returning at an unscheduled visit 
within 1 week are r equired to only re-measure IOP in both eyes.  Upon return for an 
unscheduled qualification visit, such individuals’ IOP measurements would need to qualify in 
both eyes at each of 08:00, 10:00 and 16:00 hours.  Individuals who fail due to IOP being ≥ 
36 mmH g in either  eye (exclusion criterion) at any of these time points  at this study visit or at 
an unscheduled visit within 1 week of the original visit MAY NOT  return for additional 
qualification visits.  
Individuals are allowed to leave the I nvestigator’s office on the day of this study visit 
between assessments, and eat and drink with no restrictions .  However, individuals are not to 
consume alcohol or engage in strenuous exercise.  
7.1.4 Visit 3. 1 (Day 1, for IOP measurement at 10:00 hours) 
Inclus ion/exclusion criteria will be reviewed again  for the qualified individual.  Qualified 
individuals will be examined.  Each examination will include: 
• Symptomatology: Individuals will be asked “How are you feeling?” 
• IOP and biomicroscopy measurements  will be  assessed   
o IOP must be measured within 30 minutes of the nominal time (ie, 09:30 to 
10:30 hours) 
At this and any other in -office visit, any subject  complaining of visual function issues 
will have visual function assessed as judged appropriate by the Investigator.   
For further participation  in the study,  unmedicated IOP at this time (10:00 hours , Day  1) 
must be > 17 mmHg  and < 36 mmHg in both eyes.  This is the third of four qualifying 
IOPs for randomization.  Qualified individuals will continue with the qualification visit.  Individuals who do NOT  
meet this requirement in both eyes may return for up to 2 additional unscheduled 
qualification visits within 1 week of failing this qualification visit.  Individuals returning at 
an unscheduled visit within 1 week are required to only re- measure IOP in both eyes.  Upon 
return, such individuals would need to qualify in both eyes at 08:00, 10:00 and 16:00 hours.  
Individuals who fail due to IOP being ≥ 36 mmHg  in either  eye (exclusion criterion) at any 
of these time points at this study visit or at an unscheduled visit within 1 week of the original visit MAY NOT  return for additional qualification visits.  
Individuals are allowed to leave the I nvestigator’s office on the day of this study visit 
between assessments, and eat and drink without restrictions .  However, individuals are not to 
consume alcohol or engage in strenuous exercise. 
7.1.5 Visit 3. 2 (Day 1, for IOP measurement at 16:00 hours) 
Inclusion/exclusion criteria  will be reviewed again for the qualified individual.

 Qualified individuals will be examined.  Each examination will include:  
• Symptomatology: Individuals will be asked “How are you feeling?” 
• IOP and biomicroscopy measur ements will be assessed  
o IOP must be measured within 30 minutes of the nominal time (ie, 15:30 to 
16:30 hours) 
For further participation  in the study, unmedicated IOP for a subject must be > 17 mmHg and 
< 36 mmHg in both eyes at this time (16:00 hours, Day 1).  This is the fourth of four qualifying IOPs for randomization .   
Individuals who do NOT  meet this requirement in both eyes may return for up to 2 additional 
unscheduled qualification visits within 1 week of failing the first qualification visit.  Individuals returning at an unscheduled visit within 1 week are required to only re- measure 
IOP in both eyes.  Upon return, such individuals would need to qualify in both eyes at 08:00, 10:00 and 16:00 hours.  Individuals who fail due to IOP being ≥ 36 mmHg  in either eye 
(exclusion criterion) at any of these time points at this study visit or at an unscheduled visit within 1 week of the original visit MAY NOT  return for additional qualification visits.  
As noted in Section  4.2, subject s must qualify in both eyes based upon IOP and ocular 
history.  T he study eye will be the eye with the higher IOP  at 08:00 hours on Visit 3.  If both 
eyes have the same IOP at 08:00 hours on Visit 3, then the right eye will b e the study eye.  In 
each subject , BOTH eyes will be treated.   
At this point, eligible subject s will be enrolled and assigned to an investigational product

9.1 Primary Hypotheses   
• H01:  The difference between study eyes treated with PG324  Ophthalmic Solution  and 
study eyes treated with Latanoprost Ophthalmic Solution 0.005% (PG324 − latanoprost), 
in mean IOP at the following time points: 08:00, 10:00, and 16:00 hours at the Week 2, 
Week 6, and Month 3 Visits, is ≥ 0 mmHg for at least one time point over all visits.

Confidential  Page 51 of 93  
   
 • H11:  The difference between study eyes treated with PG324  Ophthalmic Solution  and 
study eyes trea ted with Latanoprost Ophthalmic Solution 0.005% (PG324 − latanoprost), 
in mean IOP at the following time points: 08:00, 10:00, and 16:00 hours at the Week 2, 
Week 6, and Month 3 Visits, is < 0 mmHg for all time points over all visits.  
• H02:  The difference between study eyes treated with PG324  Ophthalmic Solution  and 
study eyes treated with AR -13324 Ophthalmic Solution 0.02% (PG324 − AR-13324), in 
mean IOP  at the following time points: 08:00, 10:00, and 16:00 hours at the Week 2, 
Week 6, and Month 3 Visits, is ≥ 0 mmHg for at least one time point over all visits.  
• H12:  The difference between study eyes treated with PG324  Ophthalmic Solution  and 
study eyes treated with AR -13324 Ophthalmic Solution 0.02% (PG324 − AR-13324), in 
mean IOP at the following time points: 08:00, 10:00, and 16:00 hours at the Week 2, 
Week 6, and Month 3 Visits, is < 0 mmHg for all time points over all visits.  
The study will be considered a success if both H 01 and H 02 are rejected.  
9.2 Sample Size Considerations  
Efficacy:  
One-hundred ninet y six (196) subjects per arm completing 3 months of treatment yields at 
least 90% power to conclude statistical superiority of PG324 to latanoprost and >99% power 
to conclude statistical superiority of PG324 to AR-13324 at all nine time points assuming a two-sided alpha = 0.05, a true mean difference of 1.5 mmHg (to latanoprost) and 2.0 mm Hg 
(to AR -13324), a common standard deviation of 3.5 mmHg at each time point, and 
independence among time points.  Each time point within each visit will be modeled separately.  Therefore, 196 subjects per arm yield at least 90% power to conclude superiority 
to both controls over all nine time points.  Power increases as the correlation among time points increases.   
9.3 Analysis Populations   
Randomized Population: The randomized population will include all subjects who were 
randomized to treatment.  Baseline variables and demographic characteristics will be 
summarized for this population. 
Intent- to-Treat Population (ITT): The ITT population will include all randomized subjects 
who have received at least one dose of study medication.  This population will be the primary population for efficacy analyses and will be used to summarize all efficacy variables and will summarize subjects as randomized. 
Per-protocol population (PP): The PP population is a subset of the ITT population, which 
will include those subjects (and their visits) who do not have major protocol violations likely to seriously affect the primary outcome of the study as judged by a masked evaluation prior to the unmasking of the study treatment.  This population will be the secondary population for efficacy analyses and will be used to summarize a subset of efficacy variables.  If the PP

Confidential  Page 52 of 93  
   
 and ITT populations are e xactly the same, then additional efficacy analyses on the PP 
population will not be performed.  The PP population will summarize subjects as treated. 
Safety Population: The safety population will include all randomized subjects who have 
received at least o ne dose of study medication.  This population will be used to summarize 
safety variables and will summarize subjects as treated.   
9.4 Statistical Methods to be Employed 
9.4.1 General Considerations  
All continuous study assessments will be summarized by treatment a nd time point (as 
applicable) using descriptive statistics (n, mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, and 
maximum).  All categorical study assessments will be summarized by treatment and time point (as applicable) using frequency counts and percentages.   
Hypothesis testing, unless otherwise indicated, will be performed at a 2-sided 0.05 
significance level.  When applicable, two -sided 95% confidence intervals will be reported.  
All p -values will be displayed to four decimal places, with p -values less th an 0.0001 
presented as '< 0.0001' and p-values greater than 0.9999 presented as ‘> 0.9999’.  Differences between PG324 and each comparator (latanoprost and AR -13324) will be calculated as 
PG324 – comparator.   
All study data will be listed by treatment, su bject and time point (as applicable).   
For diurnally- adjusted IOP, baseline will refer to the time -relevant measure at Visit 3.0 
through 3.2 ( eg, IOP at 08:00 hours at Visit 3.0 will be the baseline for 08:00 hours at Visit 
4.0, Visits 5.0 and 6.0, IOP at 10:00 hours at Visit 3.1 will be the baseline for 10:00 hours at 
Visit 4.1, Visits 5.1 and 6.1, etc.).  For all other variables, baseline is defined as the last measurement prior to the first dose of study medication.  
The unit of analysis for efficacy will be the study eye.  T he study eye will be the eye with the 
higher IOP at 08:00 hours on Visit 3.  If both eyes have the same IOP at 08:00 hours on Visit 
3, then the right eye will be the study eye. 
Statistical methods will be more fully described in a se parate document ( ie, the Statistical 
Analysis Plan).   
9.4.2 Interim  Analyses 
There is no planned interim analysis.   9.4.3 Analysis of Baseline Data 
Demographic and baseline characteristics such as age, gender, or disease status will be 
summarized and listed.  Medical history, history of ocular surgery and procedures, glaucoma history and washout period will also be summarized and listed.

Confidential  Page 53 of 93  
   
 9.4.4 Subject Disposition  
Subject enrollment, discontinuation of Investigational Product, and withdrawal from the 
study will be summarized and listed.  
9.4.5 Analysis of Efficacy  
The primary efficacy outcome will be comparison of PG324 Ophthalmic Solution relative to each of its active components (AR-13324 0.02% and latanoprost 0.005%) for:  
• Mean IOP within a treatment group at 08:00, 10:00, and 16:00 hours evaluated at the Week 2, Week 6, and Month 3 study visits 
Secondary efficacy outcomes will include comparison of PG324 Ophthalmic Solution 
relative to each of its active components (AR -13324 0.02% and latanoprost 0.005%) for: 
• Mean IOP w ithin a treatment group at each post- treatment time point  
• Mean diurnal IOP within a treatment group at each post- treatment visit 
• Mean change from diurnally adjusted baseline IOP at each post -treatment time point  
• Mean change from baseline in diurnal IOP at each post- treatment visit  
• Mean percent change from diurnally adjusted baseline IOP at each post -treatment time 
point 
• Mean percent change from baseline in diurnal IOP at each post -treatment visit  
• Percentages of subjects achieving pre- specified mean, mean change, and percent mean 
change in diurnal IOP levels  
Additional secondary efficacy analyses may be conducted as described in the study Statistical Analysis Plan.  Note that each subject will have one eye designated as the study eye.  Only the study eye s will be evaluated for the primary efficacy measure or for selected secondary 
efficacy measures; however, both eyes will be treated.   F ellow eyes will be evaluated 
separately for the primary analysis of the primary efficacy measure.    
The primary analys is of the primary outcome will employ a linear model with mean IOP at 
the given visit (Week 2, Week 6, and Month 3) and time point (08:00, 10:00, and 16:00 hours ) as the response, baseline IOP as a covariate, and treatment as a main effect factor, 
using the intent to treat population with multiple imputation techniques (eg, Monte Carlo Markov Chain) used to impute missing data. Each time point within each visit will be modeled separately.  The least squares mean differences (test – control) between PG324 
Ophthalmic Solution and each of latanoprost ophthalmic solution 0.005% and AR-13324 
Ophthalmic Solution 0.02% will be presented as well as 2-sided p-values and 95% confidence intervals. For a given comparator (latanoprost and AR-13324), if the p- value is 
P < 0.05 and the point estimate < 0 for all time points at the Week 2, Week 6, and Month 3 
PG324 Ophthalmic Solution

 Visits , then the corresponding null hypothesis will be rejected in favor of the alternative 
hypothesis and PG324 will be considered to be superior to the comparator.  R esults will be 
presented in both tabular and graphical form. 
Analyses will be performed primarily on the ITT population using multiple imputation 
techniques to impute missing data and secondarily using: observed data only, last observation carried forward (LOCF) where LOCF will be performed using time- relevant measures; and 
baseline observation carried forward (BOCF) using time- relevant measures to determine the 
robustness of results.  Additionally, the above analyses will be repeated on the PP population to determine robustness of results.  Additional imputation techniques may be designated in the formal Statistical Analysis Plan.  Sample SAS code to demonstrate the methodology that 
will be used for data imputation can be found in Appendix 7.  
Secondary analyses of the primary endpoint will be completed using individual two- sample t -
tests and 95% t-distribution confidence intervals for each comparison (PG324 vs latanoprost and AR-13324) at each time point (08:00, 10:00, and 16:00 at the Week 2, Week 6, and Month 3 Visits) using the ITT population. Similar analyses will be completed on the secondary endpoints: mean IOP measure at each time point and visit and mean diurnal IOP and change from baseline diurnal IOP measures.  Models adjusting for baseline will only be 
performed on the mean IOP response variable as inference is identical between this response and the change from baseline IOP response variable in such a model. 
Additionally, for the mean  IOP values at each time point, mixed  model repeated measures 
will be run with baseline as the covariate; treatment, visit, time point, treatment by visit, 
treatment by time point, visit by time point, and treatment by visit by time point as the fixed effect factors; and subject as the random effect, repeated measure.  An unstructured covariance structure will be used to model the within subject, between visit and time point variances.  This allows for different variances and covariances within and between time points and visits.  The treatment by visit, treatment by time point, visit by time point, and treatment by visit by time point interactions allow for a different rate of change in IOP in the different treatment arms among visits and time points.  This model will be run including the Week  2, Week 6, and Month 3 visits.   
Percent change from diurnally adjusted baseline IOP at each time point will be analyzed using two- sample t -tests, between PG324 and each comparator, at each time point and visit, 
including two- sample t -tests and 95% t-distribution confidence intervals on the difference 
(PG324 – comparator).   
Mean diurnal IOP values will be constructed by averaging the 3 diurnal IOP measurements on each of the Week 2, Week 6, and Month 3 visits.  Mean diurnal baseline IOP will be 
constructed as the average of the three  Day 1 IOP measurements.  Mean change from mean 
baseline diurnal IOP will be created by taking the average of the three time points on each of Week 2, Week 6, and Month 3 visits and subtracting the single mean baseline diurnal IOP 
measurement.

 Sub-group analyses based upon pre- study characteristics such as site, demographics, or pre-
study ocular hypotensive medications may be completed to further investigate the efficacy 
measures.   
Analyses of IOP will also include summarizing the number and percentage of study eyes 
achieving mean diurnal IOP reduction from baseline of ≥ 4 to≥ 12 mmHg in 2 mmHg increments and percent reduction from baseline of 
≥ 5% to ≥ 40% in 5% increments at Week 2, 
Week 6, and Month 3.  Additionally, the number and percentage of study eyes attaining a mean 
diurnal IOP of ≤ 22 to ≤ 14 mmHg in 1 mmHg increments will be summarized at Week 2, Week 
6, and Month 3.  Fisher’s exact test (2-sided p -values) will be used to test the pair wise 
differences between treatment groups for each category at each visit.  These analyses will be presented for both the ITT and PP populations with observed data only.
 
9.4.6 Analysis of Safety 
9.4.6.1 Ocular and Systemic Safety Assessments  
Slit lamp biomicroscopy and dilated ophthalmoscopy measures will be summarized at each 
measured time point using discrete summary statistics.  
Visual acuity data will be summarized at each time point using both continuous summaries 
(logMAR ), including change from baseline, and discrete summaries, including change from 
baseline on an ETDRS chart in the number of lines and the proportion of subject s with a 
worsening of ≥ 3 lines from baseline.   
Pupil size ( diameter ) will be summarized at eac h visit and for change from baseline to each 
visit using continuous summary statistics by treatment group and visit.  
Vital signs will be summarized at each visit and for change from baseline to each visit using 
continuous summary statistics by treatment gr oup and visit. 
Corneal  endothelial cell counts taken at Screening (Visit 1)  and post- treatment  (Visit 6 .0, 
Day 90) for PG324 Ophthalmic Solution, AR-13324 Ophthalmic Solution 0.02% and latanoprost ophthalmic solution 0.005% will be summarized using continuous summaries, including change from baseline.  
Clinical laboratory results will be summarized using both continuous summaries, including change from baseline, and discrete summaries, including frequency and percent of subject s 
with an abnormal value and shift tables from baseline.  Additionally, laboratory data will be presented in data listings.  A copy of the certification and a table of the normal ranges for the reference laboratory conducting any clinical laboratory tests required by this protocol must be provided.   
9.4.6.2 Adverse Events  
Verbatim descriptions of TEAEs will be mapped to MedDRA thesaurus terms and be 
presented in a data listing.  Treatment emergent AEs, those that occur after the first dose of 
PG324 Ophthalmic Solution   
Clinical Study Protocol: PG324 -CS30 2, Amendment 1  Aerie Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
 
   
Confidential  Page 56 of 93  
   
 study medication, will be summarized by treatment group using frequency and percent for 
each system organ class (SOC) and preferred term (PT) within each SOC.  Summaries will be presented separately for ocular and non-ocular TEAEs.  These summaries will al so be 
presented for relation to Investigational Product and by severity.  Fisher’s exact test will be used to test the difference in proportions of subject s with each TEAE between treatment  
groups (SOC and PT).   
9.5 Procedure for Accounting for Missing, U nuse d, or Spurious Data   
Analyses will be performed primarily on observed data only (without imputation) and 
secondarily using: last observation carried forward (LOCF) where LOCF will be performed using time -relevant measures (ie, from the same time point of the most recent visit with a 
non-missing value); BOCF using time -relevant measures; and using multiple imputation 
methods to determine the robustness of results.  Any missing, unused, or spurious data will be noted in the final statistical report.  
9.6 Procedure for Reporting Deviations from the S tatistical Plan   
Any deviations from the S tatistical Analysis P lan will be described and a justification given 
in the final statistical report.

The initial point of entry of study data should be the subject  source documentation.  The 
location and nature of the source documentation for all data collected in the study will be 
identified in the study  files at the Investigator’s site.  In cases where no source documents 
will be used (ie, data will be recorded directly onto the e CRF  without first being recorded on 
another document, such as a flowsheet, laboratory report, or other typical form of data reporting for later transcription to the eCRF), the original data will be included in the e CRF.   
Source document information should be legible. Recorded data should only be corrected by drawing a single line through the incorrect entry and writing the revision next to the corrected data. The person who has made the correction should place his or her initials as well as the date of the cor rection next to the correction. Data may not be obliterated by 
erasure, redaction, or with correction fluid. 
Study data will be transcribed and recorded via an electronic data capture (EDC) system as 
electronic CRFs (eCRFs). Security and authorization procedures consistent with the EDC 
system must be used. At each subject visit, the appropriate eCRFs must be completed.  
Whenever an eCRF is used, be sure to provide all information requested including subject  
identification number and initials, name or number of Investigator, date(s), etc.  All 
applicable questions should be answered and all data requested should be provided.  Those areas that require a response but are not filled in correctly are considered incomplete or erroneous entries, and will have to be corrected.   
Each authorized study staff member will receive a unique access account in order to use the EDC system. Access accounts will not be shared among study staff. Authorized users will make entries and/or changes to eCRF s via a secure internet access. Each completed set of  
eCRFs will be reviewed by the Investigator who will then electronically sign and date the  
eCRF confirming that data for the subjects are complete and accurate.  
The study records must include a copy of each Investigator's CV and medical license,  
completed, FDA Form 1572 or statement of Investigator, each eCRF, subject charts/source documents, Investigator's Brochure, protocol, protocol amendments, correspondence with the Sponsor and the IRB/IEC, IP storage, receipts, returns and dispensing records, Delegation of

 Responsibilities Log, site training records, records of site monitoring,  any unmasking 
documentation, AE and SAE reporting, IRB/IEC approvals, advertisements, written 
information provided to subject s, and subject  completed ICFs. If the Investigator  moves, 
withdraws from an investigation, or retires, the responsibility for maintaining the records may be transferred to another person ( eg, Sponsor, other Investigator) who will  accept the 
responsibility. Notice of this transfer, including written acceptance, must be made to and agreed upon by the Sponsor. 
10.10 Protocol Deviations 
A protocol deviation occurs when there is non- adherence to study procedures or schedules 
which does not involve inclusion/exclusion criteria or the primary efficacy endpoint and 
which does not place the subject  at any added risk or affect the data quality or study outcome. 
Examples of deviations include common out of window visits or timed procedures, a missed procedure, etc. Sites will record protocol deviations in the study records. To the extent possible, sites will make their best efforts to quickly remedy deviations.  
The site will contact the Sponsor for clarification of inclusion/exclusion criteria as needed prior to enrollment of a study subject . The Sponsor will document clarification requests and 
responses. If a potential subject  does not meet all inclusion and exclusion criteria during 
screening, that subject may not be enrolled in the study. 
Subjects who fail to return their used study medication as r equest ed at their next study visit 
may return the used investigational product materials at the following study visit so long as they return all used investigational product by their last study visit. Failure to return all study medication by their last study visit is to be recorded as a protocol deviation. 
The site will notify the Sponsor or their representative and IRB/IEC within 10 days of  
becoming aware of any significant protocol deviation. Typically, significant protocol 
deviation include significant deviations from the inclusion and exclusion criteria that may impact interpretation or the quality of efficacy information or the safety of a subject , 
concomitant medication restrictions, or any other protocol requirement that results in a significant adde d risk to the subject  or has an impact on the quality of the data collected or 
the outcome of the study. 
The Sponsor will review, designate, and/or approve all protocol deviations prior to database 
lock. 
10.11 Access to Source Documentation  
Monitors, auditors, and other authorized representatives of the Sponsor, the governing 
IRB(s)/IEC(s), the FDA, the DHHS, other domestic government agencies, and other foreign regulatory agencies will be granted direct access to the study subject ’s original medical and 
study re cords for verification of the data and/or clinical study procedures. Access to this 
information will be permitted to representatives of the aforementioned organizations to the extent permitted by law.

 10.12 Data Generation and Analysis 
After data have been entered into the study EDC system database, a system of computerized 
data validation checks will be implemented and applied to the database.  Query reports 
pertaining to data omissions and discrepancies will be forwarded to the clinica l Investigator 
and the Sponsor for resolution.  Where required, the Investigator will be asked for supplementary information through a query.  The study EDC system database will be 
updated by the clinical investigator or their staff, in accordance with the  resolved query 
reports.  All changes to the study database will be documented.   
Once the eCRFs are monitored in the EDC system, the data management CRO and the 
Sponsor will further check the eCRFs for completeness and plausibility of the data. The data 
management CRO will use quality systems in order to verify accurate and complete data 
entry, including additional checks of the data once entered in a database (eg, range checks, cross checks and other edit checks).  
All procedures for the handling and analysis of data will be conducted using good computing 
practices meeting ICH and US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidelines for the handling and analysis of data for clinical trials.  Data will be checked per the data management CRO ’s SOPs. The database then will be locked and a biostatistician will 
complete the analyses of the data in accordance with the Statistical Analysis Plan.  
10.13 Retention of Data  
Archived versions of the EDC system database will be saved by the Sponsor consistent with ICH Good Clinica l Practices Guidelines.  The Sponsor will notify the investigator when 
documents should be returned.   
The Investigator’s site and the study clinical laboratory will retain all records related to the 
study in compliance with ICH Good Clinical Practices Guidelines and 21 CFR 312.57(c)  (see Appendix 5 for additional investigator obligations ).  
10.14 Financial Disclosure  
The Principal Investigator and Sub-investigators (as listed on Form FDA 1572) will provide financial disclosure information prior to participation in the study. The Principal Investigator and any Sub-investigators will notify the Sponsor promptly of any required revision to their financial disclosure status during the term of this study, annually, or at the end of the study 
(if applicable). The Principal Investigator and Sub-investigators will provide updated financial disclosure information upon the Sponsor’s written request following completion of the study. 
10.15 Publication and Disclosure Policy  
Aerie Pharmaceuticals , as the Sponsor, has proprietary interest in the study. Authorship and 
manuscript composition will reflect joint cooperation between multiple investigators and

1.INDICATIONS AND USAGE
Latanoprost Sterile Ophthalmic Solution is indicated for the reduction of elevated intraocular 
pressure in patients with  open- angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension.  
2.DOSAGE  AND ADMINISTRATION
The recommended dosage is one drop in the affected eye(s) once daily in the evening. If one dose is missed, treatment should continue with the next dose as normal.   
The dosage of latanoprost ophthalmic solution should not exceed once daily; the combined 
use of two or more prostaglandins, or prostaglandin analogs including latanoprost is not recommended. It has been shown that administration of these prostaglandin drug products more  than once daily may decrease the intraocular pressure (I OP) lowering effect or cause 
paradoxical elevations in IOP.    
Reduction of the IOP starts approximately 3 to 4 hours after administration and the maximum 
effect is reached after  8 to 12 hours.   
Latanoprost ophthalmic solution may be used concomitantly with other topical ophthalmic 
drug products to lower IOP.  If more than one topical ophthalmic drug is being used, the drugs should be administered at least five (5) minutes apart.  Contact lenses should be removed prior to the administration of latanoprost ophthalmic solution, and may be reinserted  15 minutes after administration.  
3.DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS
Sterile ophthalmic solution containing 50 mcg/mL latanoprost. 
4.CONTRAINDICATIONS
Known hypersensitivity to latanoprost, benzalkonium chloride, or any other ingredients in 
this product. 
5.WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS
5.1 Pigmentation  
Latanoprost has been reported to cause changes to pigmented tissues. The most frequently 
reported changes  have been increased pigmentation of the iris, periorbital tissue (eyelid), and 
eyelashes. Pigmentation is expected to increase as long as latanoprost is administered.  
The pigmentation change is due to increased melanin content in the melanocytes rather than 
to an i ncrease in t he number of melanocytes. After discontinuation of latanopr ost, 
pigmentation  of the iris is  likely to be  permanent, whi le pigmentation  of the per iorbital tissue  
and eyelash
 changes have been r eported t o be rever sible in s ome patients. Patients who 
receive treatment should be informed of the possibility of increased pigmentation. Beyond 5 
years the effects of increased pigmentation are not known [see Clinical Studies (14.2)]. 
Iris co
lor change may not be noticeable for several months  to years. Typically, the brown 
pigmentation around the pupil spreads concentricall y towards the periphery of the iris and 
PG324 Ophthalmic Solution  
Clinical Study Protocol: PG324 -CS30 2, Amendment 1  Aerie Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
Confidential  Page 78 of 93 the entire iris or parts of the iris become more brownish.  Neither nevi nor freckles of the iris 
appear t o be affected by treatment. W hile tr eatment with la tanoprost can be  continued in 
patients who develop 
noticeabl y increased iris pigmentation, these patients should be 
examined r
egularly [see Patient Counseling Information ( 17.1)]. 
5.2 Eyelash Changes 
Latanoprost 
may gradually ch ange eyelashes and vellus  hair in the treated ey e; these chang es 
include increased l ength,  thickness, pigmentati on, the number of lashes or ha irs, and 
misdirected growth o f eyelashes. Eyelash changes are usually reversible upon 
discontinuation of treatment [see Patient Counseling Information ( 17.2)]. 
5.3 Intraocu
lar Inflammation 
Latanoprost should be used with caution in patients with a history of intraocular 
inflammation (iritis/uveitis) and should  generally not be used in patients with active 
intraocular  inflammation because inflammation may be exacerbated.  
5.4 Macular Edema  
Macular edema, including cystoid macular edema, has  been reported during treatment with 
latanoprost. Latanoprost  ophthalmic solution should be used with caution in aphakic 
patients, in pseudophakic patients with a torn posterior lens capsule, or in patients with known risk factors for macular edema.  
5.5 Herpetic Keratitis  
Reactivation of Herpes Simplex keratitis has been reported  during treatment with latanoprost 
ophthalmic solution.  Latanoprost should be used with caution in patients with a history of herpetic keratitis. Latanoprost sh ould be avoided in cases of active herpes simplex keratitis 
because inflammation  may be exacerbated.  
5.6 Bacterial  Keratitis 
The
re have been r eports of  bacterial ke ratitis as sociat ed w ith the use of multiple -dose 
c
ontainers of topical ophthalmic products. These containers had been inadvertently 
contaminated by patients who, in most cases, had a concurrent corneal disease or a disruption 
of the ocular epithelial surface [see Patient Counseling Information ( 17.3)]. 
5.7 Use with
 Contact Lenses  
Contact lenses should be removed prior to the administration of latanoprost ophthalmic solution, and may be reinserted 15 minutes after administration.  
6.ADVERSE REACTIONS
The following adverse reactions were reported in  postmarketing experience and are discussed

6.1 Clinical 
Trials Experience  
Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, the adverse reaction 
rates observed in the clinical  studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the 
clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates  observed in clinical practice.  
Latanoprost was studied in three multicenter, randomized, controlled clinical trials. Patients 
received 50 mcg/mL  latanoprost once daily or 5 mg/mL active- comparator (timolol)  twice 
daily. The patient population studied had a mean age of 65±10 years. Seven percent of patients withdrew before the 6-month endpoint.

7.DRUG INTERACTIONS
In vitro studies have shown that precipitation occurs when eye drops containing thimerosal 
are mixed with latanoprost.   If such drugs are used, they should be administered at least five 
(5) minutes apart.  
The combined use of two or more prostaglandins, or prostaglandin analogs including 
latanoprost is not recommended. It has been shown that administration of these prostaglandin 
drug products more than once daily may decrease the IOP lowering effect or cause paradoxical  elevations in IOP.  
8.USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS
8.1 Pregnancy  
Teratogenic Effects: Pregnancy Category C.  
Reproduction studies have been performed in rats and rabbits.  In rabbits, an incidence of 4 of 16 dams had no viable fetuses at a dose that was approximately 80 times the maximum human dose, and the highest nonembryocidal dose in rabbits was approximately 15 times the maximum human dose. 
There are no ad equate and well -controlled studies in pregnant women. Latanoprost should be 
used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.

It is not known whether this drug or its metabolites are excreted in  human milk. Because 
many drugs are excreted in  human milk, caution should be exercised when latanoprost is 
administered to a nursing woman. 
8.4 Pediatric Use  
Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been  established.  
8.5 Geriatric Use  
No overall differences in safety or effectiveness have been  observed between elderly and 
younger patients. 10.OVERDOSAGE
Intravenous infusion of up to 3 mcg/kg in healthy volunteers produced mean plasma 
concentrations 200 times higher than during clinical treatment and no adverse reactions were 
observed.  Intravenous dosages of 5.5 to 10 mcg/kg caused abdominal pain, dizziness, fatigue, hot flushes, nausea, and sweating.  If overdosage with latanoprost occurs, treatment should be symptomatic.  
11.DESCRIPTION
Latanoprost is a prostaglandin F2α analogue. Its chemical name is isopropyl- (Z)-
7[(1R,2R,3R,5S)3,5-dihydroxy-2- [(3R)-3-hydroxy-5-phenylpentyl]cyclopentyl]-5-
heptenoate. Its  molecular formula is C 26H40O5 and its chemical structure is:  
Latanopros
t is a colorless to slightly yellow oil that is very  soluble in acetonitrile and freely 
soluble in acetone, ethanol, ethyl acetate, isopropanol,  methanol, and octanol. It is practically 
insoluble in water. 
Latanoprost ophthalmic solution 0.005% is supplied as a sterile, isotonic, buffered aqueous 
solution of latanopros t with  a pH of approximately 6.7 and an osmolality of approximately 
267 mOsmol/kg.  Each mL of Latanoprost ophthalmic solution  contains 50 micrograms of 
latanoprost.  Benzalkonium chloride, 0.02% is added as a preservative.  The inactive ingredients are: s odium chloride, sodium dihydrogen phosphate monohydrate, disodium 
hydrogen phosphate anhydrous, and water f or injection.  One drop contains approximately 
1.5 mcg of latanoprost. 
12.CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
12.1 Mechanism of Action  
Latanoprost is a prostanoid selective FP receptor agonist that is believed to reduce the 
intraocular pressure (IOP) by  increasing the outflow of aqueous humor. Studies in animals 

PG324 Ophthalmic Solution   
Clinical Study Protocol: PG324 -CS30 2, Amendment 1  Aerie Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
 
   
Confidential  Page 82 of 93  
   
 and man suggest that the main mechani sm of action is  increased uveoscleral outflow. 
Elevated IOP represents a major risk factor for glaucomatous field loss. The higher the level 
of IOP, the greater the likelihood of optic nerve damage and visual field loss. 
12.2 Pharmacodynamics  
Reduction of the IOP in man starts about 3–4 hours after administration and maximum effect 
is reached after  8–12 hours. IOP reduction is present for at least 24 hours. 
12.3 Pharmacokinetics  
Absorption 
Latanoprost is absorbed through the cornea where the isopropyl ester prodrug is hydrolyzed 
to the acid form to  become biologically active.  
Distribution  
The distribution volume in humans is 0.16 ± 0.02 L/kg. The acid of latanoprost can be 
measured in aqueous humor during the first 4 hours, and in plasma only during the first hour af ter local administration. Studies in man indicate that the peak concentration in the 
aqueous humor is reached about two hours after topical administration. 
Metabolism 
Latanoprost, an isopropyl ester prodrug, is hydrolyzed by esterases in the cornea to the biologically active acid. The active acid of latanoprost reaching the systemic circulation  
is primarily metabolized by the liver to the 1,2 -dinor and 1,2,3,4- tetranor metabolites via 
fatty acid β -oxidation. 
Excretion  
The elimination of the acid of latanoprost from human plasma is rapid (t1/2 = 17 min) after both intravenous and topical administration. Systemic clearance is approximately  
7 mL/min/kg. Following hepatic β- oxidation, the metabolites  are mainly eliminated via the 
kidneys. Approximately 88% and 98% of the administered dose are recovered in the urine after topical and intravenous dosing, respectively. 
 
13. NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY  
13.1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility 
Latanoprost was not carcinogenic in either mice or rats when  administered by oral gavage at 
doses of up to 170 mcg/kg/day (approximately 2800 times the recommended maximum 
human dose) for up to 20 and 24 months, respectively. 
Latanoprost was not mutagenic in bacteria, in mouse lymphoma, or in mouse micronucleus 
tests. Chromosome aberrations were observed in vitro with human lymphocytes.  Additional 
in vitro and in vivo studies on unscheduled DNA synthesis in rats were negative.

Confidential  Page 83 of 93 Latanoprost has not been found to have any effect on male or female fertility in animal 
studies. 
14.CLINICAL STUDIES
14.1 Elevated Baseline IOP  
Patients with mean baseline IOP of 24 – 25 mmHg who were treated for 6 months in multi-center, randomized, controlled trials demonstrated 6 – 8 mmHg reductions in IOP. This IOP 
reduction with latanoprost 0.005% dosed once daily was  equivalent to the effect of timolol 
0.5% dosed twice daily. 
14.2 Progression of Increased Iris Pigmentation  
A 3-year open -label, prospective safety study with a 2 -year extension phase was conducted to 
evaluate the progression  of increased iris pigmentation with continuous use of latanoprost 
once-daily as adjunctive therapy in 519 patients with open- angle glaucoma. The analysis was 
based on observed -cases population of the 380 patients who continued in the extension 
phase.   Results showed that the onset of noticeable increased iris pigmentation occurred 
within the first year of treatment for the majority of the patients who developed noticeabl e 
increased iris pigmentation. Patients continued to show signs of increasing iris pigmentation 
throughout the five years of the study. Observation of increased iris pigmentation did not affect the incidence, nature, or severity of adverse events  (other than increased iris 
pigmentation) recorded in the study.  IOP reduction was similar regardless of the development of increased iris pigmentation during the study.  
16.HOW  SUPPLIED/STORAGE AND HANDLING
Latanoprost ophthalmic solution is a clear, isotonic, buffered, preserved colorless solution of latanoprost 0.005% (50 mcg/mL).  It is supplied as a 2.5 mL solution in a 4 mL clear low density polyethylene bottle with a low density polyethylene dropper tip, and a turquoise high density polypropylene screw cap, and a clear PVC film with a single perforation.  
2.5 mL fill, 0.005% (50 mcg/mL): Package of 1 bottle: 
NDC 24208-463-25 Storage: Protect from light. Store unopened bottle(s) under refrigeration at 2° to 8°C (36° to 
46°F). During shipment to the patient, the bottle may be maintained at temperatures up to  
40°C (104°F) for a period not exceeding 8 days. Once a bottle  is opened for use, it may be 
stored at room temperature up to 25°C (77°F) for 6 weeks. 
17.PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION
17.1 Potential for Pigmentation 
Advise patients about the potential for increased brown pigmentation of the iris, which may 
be permanent. Inform patients about the possibility of eyelid skin darkening, which m ay be  
reversible after discontinuation of Latanoprost ophthalmic solution [see Warnings and 
Precautions (
5.1)]. 
17.2 Potent
ial for Eyelash Changes 
PG324 Ophthalmic Solution  
Clinical Study Protocol: PG324 -CS30 2, Amendment 1  Aerie Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
Confidential  Page 84 of 93 Inform patients of the possibility of eyelash and vellus hair changes in the treated eye during 
treatment with Latanoprost ophthalmic solution. These changes may result in a disparity between eyes in length, thickness, pigmentation, number of eyelashes or vellus hairs, and/or direction of eyelash growth.  Eyelash changes are usually reversible upon discontinuation of treatment.  
17.3 Handling t he C ontainer 
Instruct patients to avoi d allowing the tip of the dispensing container t o con tact t he eye or 
surrounding structures because this coul d cause the tip to  become contaminated b y 
comm
on bacteria known to cause ocular infections. Serious damage to the eye and 
subsequent loss of vision may result from using contaminated solutions [see Warnings and 
Precautions (5.6)]. 
17.4 When to 
Seek Physician Advice  
Advise patients that if they develop an intercurrent ocular condition (e.g., trauma or infection) or have ocular surgery, or develop any ocular reactions, particularly conjunctivitis and eyelid reactions, they should immediately seek their physician’s advice concerni ng the 
continued use of the multiple -dose container. 
17.5 Use with Contact Lenses  
Advise patients that Latanoprost ophthalmic solution contains benzalkonium chloride, which may be absorbed by  contact lenses. Contact lenses should be removed prior to administration 
of the solution. Lenses may be reinserted 15 minutes following administration of Latanoprost ophthalmic solution. 
17.6 Use with Other Ophthalmic Drugs  
If more than one topical ophthalmic drug is being used, the drugs should be administered at 
least five (5) minutes apart.

 Appendix  6 Declaration of Helsinki  
Recommendations Guiding Medical Doctors in Biomedical Research Involving Human 
Subject s 
I. BASIC PRINCIPLES  
1. Biom edical research involving human subjects must conform to generally accepted 
scientific principles and should be based on adequately performed laboratory and animal experimentation and on a thorough knowledge of the scientific literature. 
2. The design and performance of each experimental procedure involving human subject s 
should be clearly formulated in an experimental protocol which should be transmitted to a specially appointed independent committee for consideration, comment and guidance. 
3. Biomedical research involving human subject s should be conducted only by scientifically 
qualified persons and under the supervision of a clinically competent medical person. The responsibility for the human subject  must always rest with a medically qualified person 
and neve r rest with the subject  of the research, even though the subject has given his or 
her consent. 
4. Biomedical research involving human subject s cannot legitimately be carried out unless 
the importance of the objective is in proportion to the inherent risk to t he subject . 
5. Every biomedical research project involving human subject s should be preceded by 
careful assessment of predictable risks in comparison with foreseeable benefits to the subject  or to others. Concern for the interests of the subject  must always p revail over the 
interests of science and society.  
6. The right of the research subject  to safeguard his or her integrity must always be 
respected. Every precaution should be taken to respect the privacy of the subject  and to 
minimize the impact of the study on the subject's physical and mental integrity and on the 
personality of the subject . 
7. Doctors should abstain from engaging in research projects involving human subject s 
unless they are satisfied that the hazards inv olved are believed to be predictable. Doctors 
should cease any investigation if the hazards are found to outweigh the potential benefits. 
8. In publication of the results of his or her research, the doctor is obliged to preserve the accuracy of the results. R eports of experimentation not in accordance with the principles 
laid down in this Declaration should not be accepted for publication. 
9. In any research on human beings, each potential subject  must be adequately informed of 
the aims, methods, anticipated benefits and potential hazards of the study and the discomfort it may entail. He or she should be informed that he or she is at liberty to abstain from participation in the study and that he or she is free to withdraw his or her 
PG324 Ophthalmic Solution   
Clinical Study Protocol: PG324 -CS30 2, Amendment 1  Aerie Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
 
   
Confidential  Page 90 of 93  
   
 consent to participation at any time. The doctor should then obtain the subject 's given 
informed consent, preferably in writing. 
10. When obtaining informed consent for the research project the doctor should be 
particularly cautious if the subject  is in a dependent relationship to him or he r or may 
consent under duress. In that case, the informed consent should be obtained by a doctor who is not engaged in the investigation and who is completely independent of this official relationship. 
11. In case of legal incompetence, informed consent should be obtained from the legal guardian in accordance with national legislation. Where physical or mental incapacity makes it impossible to obtain informed consent, or when the subject  is a minor, 
permission from the responsible relative replaces that of the subject  in accordance with 
national legislation.  
12. The research protocol should always contain a statement of the ethical considerations involved and should indicate that the principles enunciated in the present Declaration are complied with.  
II. MEDICAL RESEARCH COMBINED WITH PROFESSIONAL CARE (CLINICAL RESEARCH)  
13. In the treatment of the sick person, the doctor must be free to use a new diagnostic and therapeutic measure, if in his or her judgment it offers hope of saving life, reestablishing health or allevi ating suffering.  
14. The potential benefits, hazards and discomforts of a new method should be weighed against the advantages of the best current diagnostic and therapeutic methods. 
15. In any medical study, all subject s - including those of a control group, if any, should be 
assured of the best proven diagnostic and therapeutic methods. 
16. The refusal of the subject to participate in a study must never interfere with the doctor -
subject  relationship. 
17. If the doctor considers it essential not to obtain informed consent, the specific reasons for this proposal should be stated in the experimental protocol for transmission to the independent committee. 
18. The doctor can combine medical research with professional care, the objective being the acquisition of new medical knowledg e, only to the extent that medical research is 
justified by its potential diagnostic or therapeutic value for the subject.

 III. NON -THERAPEUTIC BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH INVOLVING HUMAN 
SUBJECT  (NONCLINICAL BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH)  
19. In the purely scientific application of medical research carried out on a human being, it is 
the duty of the doctor to remain the protector of the life and health of that person on 
whom biomedical research is being carried out. 
20. The subject s should be volunteers - either healthy pe rson or subject s for whom the 
experimental design is not related to the subject 's illness.  
21. The Investigator or the team should discontinue the research if in his/her or their judgment it may, if continued, be harmful to the individual.  
22. In research on man, the interest of science and society should never take precedence over consideration related to the well -being of the subject .

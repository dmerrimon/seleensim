Title of study:  Phase 2 Multicenter, Randomized, Double -Blind, Placebo -Controlled, Parallel- Group Study to 
Assess the Efficacy, Safety, Tolerability, and Pharmacokinetics of NBI -827104 in Pediatric Subjects with 
Epileptic Encephalopathy with Continuous Spike -and-Wave During Sleep  
Protocol number:   NBI -827104- CSWS2010 
Phase of development:   2 
Study center(s):  Approximately 24 study centers in regions including, but not limited to, the United States, 
Europe, and Canada  
Primary Objective:  
• To assess the effect of NBI -827104 on the overnight epileptiform video- electroencephalogram 
(video- EEG) activity in pediatric subjects with epileptic encephalopathy w ith continuous spike -and-wave 
during sleep (EECSWS)  
Secondary Objective:  
• To evaluate the safety and tolerability of multiple doses of NBI -827104 in pediatric subjects with 
EECSWS  
Other Objectives:  
•  
  
  
  
Methodology:  This is a Phase 2, multicenter, double -blind, placebo- controlled, parallel- group study designed to 
assess the efficacy, safety, tolerability, and PK of NBI -827104 in pediatric subjects with EECSWS.  
Approximately 24 male and female subjects, 4 to 12 years of age (inclusive), will be enrolled for study participation.  Treatment will be administered for up to  including titration and taper periods.  
After providing parental or legal guardian informed consent with pediatric assent from developmentally capable pediatric subjects, subjects will be screened to determine eligibility (Days - 28 to - 1) before the start of study 
treatment dosing on Day 1.  Caregiver(s) will be given a seizure diary at screening, Day 1, and  
 and caregiver(s) will return the seizure diary at the next scheduled visit.  At least 4 days of 
baseline seizure diary data should be obtained prior to randomization.  On Day 1, eligible subjects who have a diagnosis confirmed by an external Diagnosis Confirmation Panel (DCP) will return to the study center for collection of baseline safety and efficacy assessments.  Subjects who are confirmed as eligible w ill then be 
randomized to NBI -827104 or placebo.  The first 6 subjects (randomized 2:1; ie, 4 subjects randomized to 
NBI-827104 and 2 subjects randomized to placebo) will be enrolled into a sentinel cohort for the analysis of 
safety, tolerability, and PK d ata through the end of  followed by the remaining 18 subjects in the main 
cohort (randomized 2:1 [NBI -827104:placebo]).   Study treatment will last for up to   
 
  
  
  
 
 
If an open -label extension (OLE) study is open for enrollment, eligible subjects may enter the OLE study 
following the completion of the  study visit at the end of the maintenance period.  For subjects who 
enroll directly in the OLE study, the  visit will be the final study visit of the current study.  For all other 
subjects, the end of the posttreatment safety period constitutes the end of the study.

Clinical Protocol Amendment 3.0  
05 August  2021  Confidential  6 The starting dose of study treatment for the sentinel cohort (dose level 1) will be based on body weight categories 
(based on subjects’ body weight on Day 1), as detailed in the table below.  
 
 
  Based on the exposure data obtained from the sentinel cohort, the doses may be adjusted if 
required to achieve the targeted exposure in the main cohort.  
 
 
 
 
 
S
ubjects who cannot tolerate the lowest allowable dose (ie, dose level 1) should 
remain in the study, but study treatment dosing will be discontinued.  
At the  visit, subjects will receive study treatment to administer at home during the taper period.   
 
  
 
 
  
During the posttreatment safety period, subjects/caregivers will be instructed to:  
• Contact the investigator (or designee) if symptoms worsen and require medical attention  
• Report any adverse events (AEs) or serious adverse events (SAEs)  
 
 
Safety and tolerability assessments including AE monitoring, clinical laboratory tests (including hematology, 
serum chemistry, and urinalysis), vital signs measurements, physical and neurological examinations, 12 -lead 
electrocardiograms (ECGs), and ophthalmic examinations will be conducted throughout the study.  
Ongoing review of safety and tolerability data and the unblinded analysis of sentinel cohort data (including safety and tolerability) will be conducted by the Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC); sentinel cohort data 
(including PK data) will be evaluated before proceeding to the main cohort.  The IDMC has the overall 
responsibility of safeguarding the interests of the subjects by monitoring data obtained in the study and making appropriate recommendations based on the reported data, thus ensuring that the study is being conducted with high scientific and ethical standards.  Study site personnel and the Sponsor (except for supply chain personnel not involved in decisions regarding subject treatment) will remain blinded.  
Available PK and safety data for the sentinel cohort will be reviewed by the ID MC to determine if a dose 
adjustment should be instituted prior to enrolling the main cohort.  Dose reductions or alterations in the escalation paradigm may be recommended by the IDMC to the Sponsor after the sentinel cohort if the drug is not sufficiently  tolerated.  In addition, dose reductions or escalations may be instituted if the median exposure values 
for the sentinel cohort lie outside the 5th to 95th percentiles of the simulated reference range across the PK sampling intervals.

5. INTRODUCTION 
5.1. Background  
Calcium is an important signal transduction element in neurons and its entry into the cell is 
tightly regulated by two major classes of voltage- gated calcium channels:  the high -voltage 
activated (L -, N-, P/Q- and R-types) and the low- voltage activated (T -type) calcium channels 
(Catterall et al.,  2005).    
Three T -type calcium channel subtypes with different electrophysiological properties have been 
described:  Cav3.1, Cav3.2 and Cav3.3 ( Lee et al., 1999; Perez-Reyes, 2003)  and are widely 
expressed in the brain ( Talley et al., 1999) .  Under physiological conditions, T- type calcium 
channels promote cellular rebound bursting by de-inactivating during hyperpolarization and 
opening at low-voltage thresholds.  With their high expression levels in both cortex and thalamus (Talley et al., 1999), these channels are positioned to regulate synchronized oscillations within the thalamocortical circuit ( Cheong et al., 2013; Lambert et al., 2014).    
Abnormal T- type calcium -channel -mediated oscillations can be observed during idiopathic 
generalized epilepsy (IGE) seizures, in particular absence seizures that are characterized by 
spike-wave discharges, in both humans and animals ( Khosravani et al., 2006; 
Zamponi et  al., 2010;  Cheong et al., 2013).  The role of T-type calcium channels in generating 
spike- wave discharges in the cortico -thalamocortical network in absence seizures is well 
described.  Mutations were identified in the gene expressing the Cav3.2 subtype in patients with 
childhood absence epilepsy and other forms of IGE (Khosravani et al., 2006; Heron  et al., 2007; 
Zamponi et al., 2010; Eckle et al., 2014) .  Several of these mutations increase the intrinsic 
activity of the channels, whereas others increase the intracellular trafficking of the channels to the plasma membrane; most mutations enhance calcium currents.  A direct consequence of this is increased excitability in neurons that exhibit enhanced bursting activity, thereby contributing to 
the generation of epileptiform discharges.  Several rodent models confirm the importance of the 
Cav3.2 channel subtype.  In genetic rat models of spontaneous absence-like epilepsy (genetic absence epilepsy in rats from Strasbourg [GAERS]; Wistar Albino Glaxo from Rijswijk 
[WAG/Ri j]), a gain -of-function mutation of the Cav3.2 gene has been reported 
(Powell  et al., 2009) , as well as elevated levels of Cav3.2 mRNA, and increased T -type calcium 
currents ( Tsakiridou et al., 1995; Talley et al., 2000; Broicher et al., 2008; Powell et al., 2009). 
Neurocrine Biosciences, Inc., Study No. NBI -827104- CSWS2010  
Clinical Protocol Amendment 3.0  
05 August  2021  Confidential  18 Several lines of evidence also link mutations in the Cav3.1 subtype with epilepsy in humans and 
in rodent animal models.  Genetic variants have been detected in patients with juvenile 
myoclonic epilepsy, another form of IGE (Lory et al., 2010).   Overexpression of Cav3.1 
channels in mice leads to frequent bilateral cortical seizures ( Ernst et al., 2009) and Cav3.1 
knockout mice are protected from absence seizures ( Kim et al., 2001; Song et al., 2004).  No 
association has been made so far between Cav3.3 subtype mutations and human epilepsy. 
Disruptions in the neurotransmission of the same cortico- thalamocortical circuitry involved in 
absence seizures are considered to contribute also to sleep -potentiated continuous spike- wave 
discharges observed in epileptic encephalopathy with continuous spike-wave discharges during 
sleep (EECSWS) (Sánchez Fernández et al., 2012 ; Singhal et al., 2014) .  EECSWS is a spectrum 
of epileptic conditions  (International League Against Epilepsy, 2018)  sharing the following 
characteristics:  (1) electroclinical seizures, (2) sleep potentiation of epileptiform activity, 
(3) neurocognitive regression/stagnation, and (4) an age-related evolution of the condition, with 
onset in early childhood and spontaneous improvement before pub erty 
(Sánchez Fernández et  al., 2012; De Giorgis et al., 2017;  Singhal et al., 2014).  The sleep 
potentiation of epileptiform activity leads to an electroencephalographic pattern of electrical status epilepticus during sleep (ESES), which consists of continuous spike-waves during 
nonrapid eye movement (NREM) sleep.  This phenomenon has been suggested to interfere with normal recuperation functions of sleep, thereby adversely affecting learning abilities, language, 
memory, and other cognitive domains ( Bölste rli et al., 2011; Bölsterli Heinzle et al., 2014; 
Bölsterli et  al., 2017) .  Although the clinical seizures and ESES disappear with age (around 
puberty)  (Morikawa et al., 1989; Saltik et al., 2005; Kobayashi et al., 2006 ; 
Loddenkemper et al., 2011) , neurocognitive regression can remain (Singhal et al., 2014; 
Tassinari et al., 2000; Nickels et al., 2008) .  The extent of the neurocognitive regression seems to 
correlate with the duration a child had been affected by ESES ( Seegmüller et al., 2012; 
Maltoni et  al., 2016; van den Munckhof et al., 2018).  
5.2. NBI-827104  
NBI-827104 is a novel selective and orally available triple T-type calcium channel blocker. 
NBI-827104 effectively crosses the blood-brain barrier and shows dose-dependent efficacy in 
3 rodent models of generalized epilepsy, including synergistic effects when combined with 
established antiseizure medications (ASMs).  Considering the role of T- type calcium channels in 
the pathophysiology of IGE and spike- wave discharges in particular, the nonclinical data, and the 
unmet medical need, NBI -827104 will be developed for the treatment of EECSWS.

ased on a population pharmacokinetic (PK) model, weight-based dose regimens 
were developed across weight categories to determine the actual daily mg doses to be 
administered based on individual subject body weight. 
The maximum exposure level for all subjects will be the target exposure level  
  The doses for the sentinel cohort ( Table 1)  were calculated based on a population 
PK model.  After  PK data are assessed in the sentinel cohort, doses for the main cohort 
may be adjusted to achieve the target exposure level.  Dose reductions or alterations in the escalation paradigm may be implemented after the sentinel cohort if the drug is not sufficiently tolerated.  
5.4. Benefit-Risk  Assessment  
EECSWS is a spectrum of epileptic conditions ( International League Against Epilepsy, 2018) 
with onset in early childhood and include sleep potentiation of epileptiform activity. The 
potentiation of epileptiform activity during sleep leads to an electroencephalogram (EEG) pattern 
of electrical status epilepticus during sleep ( ESES ), which consists of continuous spike- waves 
during non-REM sleep and has been suggested to interfere with normal recuperation functions of 
sleep, thereby adversely affecting learning abilities, language, memory, and other cognitive 
domains (Bölsterli et al., 2011; Bölsterli Heinzle et al., 2014 ; Bölsterli et al., 2017) . Although 
spontaneous improvement before puberty is observed with EECSWS, neurocognitive regression can remain ( Singhal et al., 2014; Tassinari et al., 2000; Nickels et al., 2008).  
Abnormal T-type calcium channel oscillations have been implicated in the pathophysiology of IGE and spike-wave discharges, in particular. As a novel selective and orally available triple 
T‑-type calcium channel blocker which effectively crosses the blood -brain barrier, NBI -827104 
may be effective in the treatment of EECSWS. NBI -827104 has demonstrated efficacy in 
3 rodent models of generalized epilepsy, including synergistic effects when combined with established ASMs. The current study will be the first clinical study to evaluate efficacy of 
NBI‑827104 in pediatric subjects with EECSWS.

T
here are no approved treatments for pediatric patients with EECSWS. Considering the role of 
T-type calcium channels in the pathophysiology of spike-wave discharges, the nonclinical and 
clinical data, and the unmet medical need, NBI -827104 is being developed for the treatment of 
pediatric subjects with EECSWS. This is a randomized, placebo-controlled study that includes a 
sentinel cohort of 6 subjects that allows the analysis of safety, tolerability, and PK data through 
 of the study before enrolling additional subjects. The randomization scheme of 2:1 
(NBI ‑827104:placebo) enables a higher proportion of subjects to receive active treatm ent while 
still allowing for assessment of efficacy, safety, and tolerability in a randomized, placebo-
controlled study design. The study includes appropriate safety monitoring throughout the study, including assessment of suicidal behavior and ideation using the Children’s Columbia- Suicide 
Severity Rating Scale (C -SSRS) as appropriate and ophthalmic examinations as noted above.

7. STUDY DESIGN  
This is a Phase 2, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study designed to 
assess the efficacy, safety, tolerability, and PK of NBI-827104 in pediatric subjects w ith 
EECSWS.  Approximately 24 male and female subjects, aged 4 to 12 years (inclusive), will be 
enrolled for study participation.  Treatment will be administered for up to  including titration and taper periods. 
After providing parental or legal guardian informed consent with pediatric assent from 
developmentally capable pediatric subjects, subjects will be screened to determine eligibility 
(Days -28 to -1) before the start of study treatment dosing on Day 1.  Caregiver(s) will be given a 
seizure diary , and caregiver(s) 
will return the seizure diary at the next scheduled visit.  At least 4 days of baseline seizure diary 
data should be obtained prior to randomization. On Day 1, eligible subjects who have a diagnosis 
confirmed by an external Diagnosis Confirmation Panel (DCP) will return to the study center for collection of baseline safety and efficacy assessments.  Subjects who are confirmed as eligible 
for the study will then be randomized to NBI-827104 or placebo.  The first 6 subjects 
(randomized 2:1; ie, 4 subjects randomized to NBI-827104 and 2 subjects randomized to placebo) will be enrolled into a sentinel cohort for the analysis of safety, tolerability, and PK data 
through the end of  followed by the remaining 18 subjects in the main cohort 
(randomized 2:1 [NBI-827104:placebo]).  Study treatment will last for up to ,  
 
  
 
  
 
 
 
If an open-label extension (OLE) study is open for enrollment, eligible subjects may enter the 
OLE study following the completion of the  study visit at the end of the maintenance 
period.  For subjects who enroll directly in the OLE study, the  visit will be the final study visit of the current study.  For all other subjects, the end of the posttreatment safety period constitutes the end of the study. 
The starting dose of study treatment for the sentinel cohort (dose level 1) will be based on body 
weight categories (based on subjects’ body weight on Day 1), as detailed in  Table 1.  T his study 
intends to target exposures equivalent to those observed  
 in adults   Based on the exposure

ubjects who cannot tolerate the lowest allowable study dose (ie, dose level 1) should remain in 
the study but study treatment dosing will be discontinued. At the  visit, subjects will receive study treatment to admin ister at home during the taper 
period.  
 
 
 
  During the posttreatment 
safety period, subjects/caregivers will be instructed to: 
• Contact the investigator (or designee) if symptoms worsen and require medical 
atten tion 
• Report any adverse events (AEs) or serious adverse events (SAEs) 
 
 
 
Safety and tolerability assessments including AE monitoring, clinical laboratory tests (including hematology, serum chemistry, and urinalysis), vital signs measurements, physical and 
neurological examinations, 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), and ophthalmic examinations will 
be conducted throughout the study. 
Ongoing review of unblinded safety and tolerability data and the analysis of sentinel cohort data 
(including safety, tolerability) will be conducted by the Independent Data Monitoring Committee

main cohort.  The IDMC has the overall responsibility of safeguarding the interests of the 
subjects by monitoring data obtained in the study and making appropriate recommendations based on the reported data, thus ensuring that the study is being conducted with high scientific 
and ethical standards.  Study site personnel and the Sponsor (except for supply chain personnel 
not involved in decisions regarding subject treatment) will remain blinded. 
Available PK and safety dat a for the sentinel cohort will be reviewed by the IDMC to determine 
if a dose adjustment should be instituted prior to enrolling the main cohort.  Dose reductions or 
alterations in the escalation paradigm may be recommended to the Sponsor by the IDMC after the sentinel cohort if the drug is not sufficiently tolerated.  In addition, dose reductions or 
escalations may be instituted if the median exposure values for the sentinel cohort lie outside the 
5th to 95th percentiles of the simulated reference range ac ross the PK sampling intervals.

05 August  2021  Confidential  38 according to the procedure as specified in the laboratory manual.  Samples will be shipped  
 to the central laboratory for analysis. 
9.4. Safety Assessments  
Concomitant medication use and AEs will be monitored throughout the study as described in 
Section  9.7.1 and Section  11, respectively.  Additional safety assessments are described in the 
following sections. 
For any abnormal safety ass essment deemed clinically significant, the investigator will perform 
appropriate follow -up assessments (eg, repeat analysis), until the cause of the abnormality is 
determined and/or until the value returns to baseline (or within normal limits), or the inve stigator 
deems the abnormality to be of no clinical significance. 
Appropriate psychiatric evaluation and intervention will be provided for any treatment- emergent 
suicidal behavior or clinically significant suicidal ideation.  
9.4.1. Independent Data Monitoring Co mmittee  
Ongoing review of safety and tolerability data and the unblinded analysis of sentinel cohort data 
(including safety, tolerability, and PK data [PK data will only be assessed at  will be 
conducted by the IDMC.  The IDMC has the overall responsibility of safeguarding the interests 
of the subjects by monitoring data obtained in the study and making appropriate recommendations based on the reported data, thus ensuring that the study is being conducted 
with high scientific and ethical standards.  Provisions will be in place to maintain the blinding of 
Sponsor study personnel.  The IDMC charter will describe the responsibilities, meeting frequency and data review procedures for the members to follow. 
The first 6 subjects (randomized 2:1; ie, 4 subj ects randomized to NBI -827104 and 2 subjects 
randomized to placebo) will be enrolled into a sentinel cohort for the analysis and review of 
safety, tolerability, and review of PK data through  by an IDMC, before proceeding with 
enrollment of the  remaining 18 subjects in the main cohort (randomized 2:1 
[NBI -827104:placebo]). 
9.4.2. Vital Sign Measurements  
Vital sign measurements, including SBP and DBP, pulse rate, and body temperature will be 
measured.  Orthostatic blood pressures may be considered optional if the subject is unable to 
stand (eg, subject is in a wheelchair). If the investigator is unable to obtain orthostatic blood pressures, the reason for non-collection must be documented.  Blood pressure and pulse rate will 
be measured using a calibrated aut omatic blood pressure cuff after the subject has been supine 
for at least 5 minutes and after approximately 2 minutes standing, if possible. 
Vital sign measurements will be obtained before any scheduled blood sample collection at 
screening, Day 1 (prior to study treatment administration), and beginning of  (prior to 
study treatment administration),  (prior to study treatment administration),  (prior to study treatment administration), end of  (prior to study treatment administration and 3 hours

05 August  2021  Confidential  39 9.4.3. Medical History  
A medical history will be taken at the screening visit and updated on Day 1 and as needed 
throughout the study.  
9.4.4. Physical and Neurological Examination Including Height/Length and Weight 
The complete physical and neurological examination will consist of an assessment of general 
appearance, skin and mucosae, head, eyes, ears, nose, throat, neck (including thyroid), lymph 
nodes, chest/lungs, cardiovascular, abdomen, extremities, musculoskeletal, and neurological 
system, including assessment of level of consciousness, mental status, motor activity (including strength, tone, coordination, and reflexes), sensory testing, and gait.   
A complete physical and neurological examination including weight will be performed at 
screening, Day 1 and end of  (or early termination).  Height/length 
will be measured at screening only.  Height/length may be optional if the participant is unable to 
stand. If the investigator is unable to obtain height, the reason for non- collection must be 
captured in the eCRF. Height and weight will be measured with subjects not wearing shoes. 
9.4.5. Electrocardiogram  
A standard 12- lead ECG will be recorded in triplicate (at least 1 minute apart and within 
15 minutes) after the subject has rested supine for at least 5 minutes.  The ECG will be centrally 
read and the parameters that will be assessed include pulse, PR interval, QRS duration, QT interval, and QTcF (machine readings or calculated).  Additionally, the occurrence of de- and re-
polarization and rhythm disorders or other abnormalities will be assessed.  Based on the review 
of these parameters, the Investigator will note if the ECG is Normal, Abnormal not Clinically Significant, or Abnormal Clinically Significant.  If the ECG is Abnormal Clinically Significant, 
the investigator or designee will p rovide a description of the abnormality recorded on the AE 
eCRF.  
The 12-lead ECG will be conducted at screening, Day 1 (prior to study treatment administration), 
and beginning of  (prior to study treatment administration),  (prior to study treatment 
administration),  (prior to study treatment administration), end of  (prior to study treatment administration and 3 hours post study treatment administration),  (prior to study treatment administration),  and  (or early termination). 
9.4.6. Clinical Laboratory Assessments 
All clinical laboratory assessments will be performed by a central laboratory.  In addition, a urine 
pregnancy test will be performed by the study site on Day 1 to confirm subject eligibility.  The 
central laboratory will pro vide instructions and supplies to the study staff before study initiation 
and instructions will be included in a laboratory manual.  The laboratory test battery will include 
routine and screening laboratory tests. 
The following clinical safety laboratory assays will be performed:   
Hematology:  complete blood count including white blood cell (WBC) count with differential, 
red blood cell (RBC) count, hemoglobin, hematocrit, and platelet count, mean corpuscular 
hemoglobin (MCH), mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), mean corpuscular 
volume (MCV), red cell distribution width (RDW), mean platelet volume (MPV).

Urinalysis:  specific gravity, nitrite, ketones, protein, urobilinogen, glucose, bilirubin, leukocyte 
esterase, occult blood, and pH; microscopic examination of sediment will be performed only if the results of the urinalysis dipstick evaluation are positive for nitrite, protein, leukocyte esterase, 
or blood. Urine samples may be considered optional if the subject is unable to provide urine (eg, 
participant is in a diaper).  
The following additional laboratory tests will be performed: 
Serology:  Blood will be collected for HIV -Ab, HBsAg, and HCV- Ab and reflex nucleic acid 
amplification testing (if applicable) at screening.  
Drug screen : Blood will be collected at screening for a cannabinoid drug testing. A urine 
cannabinoid drug test may be performed if blood test results are not available prior to randomization at Day 1. 
Pregnancy Test:   Pregnancy tests will be performed for female subjects of childbearing potential.  
A serum (β -hCG) pre gnancy test will be performed at screening and a urine pregnancy test will 
be performed on Day 1 and end of  using a urine pregnancy kit provided 
by the central laboratory. A serum pregnancy test may be performed if it is not possible to obtain urine. 
9.4.7. Estimated Total Blood Sample Volume 
The estimated total blood sample volume for each subject is presented in Table  3.  T hese 
estimates include samples to be collected during screening, the treatment periods, and the final visit (or upon early termination).

05 August  2021  Confidential  41 9.4.8. Columbia -Suicide Severity Rating Scale Children’s Versions  
The C -SSRS is a validated instrument to prospectively assess suicidal ideation and behavior 
(http://www.cssrs.columbia.edu).  There are versions of the questionnaire designed for use at 
screening (Children’s Baseline version) and at baseline and visits throughout the study (Children’s Since Last Contact version).  All versions of the C-S SRS include a series of 
screening questions related to suicidal ideation and suicidal behavior.  Subject responses of “yes” to one or more screening questions will prompt additional questions that evaluate frequency and intensity of suicidal ideation and/or behavior. 
The C -SSRS Children’s Version will be administered to subjects ≥6 years of age at screening. 
Younger subjects or subjects with developmental impairment for whom the C-SSRS would be 
inappropriate will be monitored for suicidality based on clinic al impression.  
Subjects with any lifetime suicidal behavior or lifetime suicidal ideation of type 4 (active suicidal ideation with some intent to act, without specific plan) or type 5 (active suicidal ideation with specific plan and intent) based on the C-SSRS should be excluded (see exclusion criterion #24).  
The C -SSRS will be administered and scored by the investigator or qualified study center 
perso nnel at screening, Day 1, beginning of  and end of  
(or early termination). 
9.4.9. Ophthalmic Examination 
An age-appropriate ophthalmic examination will be performed consisting of visual acuity, pupillary light refle x, retinoscopy, as well as slit lamp microscopy testing (following pupillary 
dilation, and if cooperation can be achieved).  
Clinically relevant findings occurring after informed consent and meeting the definition of an AE 
(new AE or worsening of a previously existing condition) must be recorded on an AE page of the eCRF.  
Ophthalmic examinations will be performed at screening, and end of weeks  
 (or early termination) and may be performed within 7 days of the scheduled visit. 
9.5. Specific St udy Period Information  
Study visits during the maintenance period may be conducted remotely if individual in-person 
study visits at the study site are not possible due to Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID 19) 
related reasons (eg, subject is not able to travel to the site for safety reasons or as part of public health measures).  In this situation, study treatment may be shipped directly to a subject 
(Section  10.4).  If any study visits during the maintenance period required to be conducted at the 
site are conducted via telephone or a tele-health platform, this will be documented in the source. 
Assessments at these visits that must be conducted at the site  (eg, overnight video- EEG) may be 
rescheduled.  Any visit assessments that are missed or conducted outside the visit window will be recorded as COVID -19 related protocol deviations. 
Assessments for each study visit are not required to be conducted in the o rder listed in the 
following sections but should be scheduled to minimize subject fatigue and interference with the subject's ability to sleep during the video-EEG, for study visits with an overnight video- EEG.

9.7. Prohibitions and Restrictions  
9.7.1. Prior and Concomitant Medications 
All prescription and over-the-counter medications, dietary supplements (including vitamins), and herbal supplements taken by the subject within 30 days before screening will be recorded on the Prior and Concomitant Medications page of the eCRF.   
The following medications are allowed: 
•Stable background treatment (ie, no dose changes from  prior to screening
and no changes anticipated during the study) with at least 1 and up to 3 concomitantASMs and /or ketogenic diet/modified Atkins diet.  Epidiolex/Epidyolex is allowed
and will be considered an ASM.  Felbamate is allowed if the subject has beenreceiving the drug for at least 1  year prior to screening with no safety concerns.
During the study durat ion, subjects will receive the ASMs according to their regular
administration schedule.  Vagal nerve stimulator (VNS) and ketogenic diet are notcounted as ASMs.
•Supportive non-ASM specific therapies (eg, methylphenidate) on stable dose from2 weeks prior to screening and no changes anticipated during the study.
•Standard of care medication or medication to treat AEs not mentioned as a prohibitedconcomitant medication.
The following medications are prohibited beginning 30 days before screening until the final study visit (or early termination): 
•
•Cannabinoids except Epidiolex/Epidyolex.
Pulse therapies such as systemic corticosteroids and IVIG are prohibited for at least 8 weeks 
prior to screening until the final study visit (or early termination). Other chronic use of steroids, with the exception of steroid replacement therapy, must be approved by the Sponsor.

9.7.3. Other Restrictions  
Subjects will be confined to the study center for 3 overnight stays (screening,  visit 
[approximately 24 hours], and  visit).  Subjects will be discharged from the study center after completion of study assessments in the morning after overnight stays. 
Participation in another investigational drug study is prohibited for at least 30 days after the last 
dose of study treatment or 30 days after study completion, whichever is longer. 
9.8. Discontinuation of Study Treatment and Su bject Withdrawal  
Subjects/caregivers can discontinue study treatment or withdraw their consent to participate in the study at any time.  The investigator must discontinue study treatment dosing or withdraw any subject from the study if a subject/caregiver requests study treatment dosing to be discontinued 
or to be withdrawn from the study, respectively.  All subjects prematurely discontinuing study 
treatment dosing should continue study participation to be followed for safety and efficacy outcomes. 
9.8.1. Discontinuation of Study Treatment Dosing 
If a subject prematurely discontinues study treatment dosing, the investigator will record the 
reason for discontinuation on the relevant eCRF.  Such subjects will not be automatically withdrawn from the study and should continue participation in the study.  The investigator, 
subject’s parent/legal guardian, and subject should discuss a plan for continued participation.  
Data for any outcome measures, particularly the primary endpoint, as well as safety follow -up, 
are important to collect.  For any subsequent study visits after study treatment is prematurely 
discontinued, subjects will not be required to undergo PK sampling.  Additional study visits and assessments for participants who discontinue study treatment but agree to remain in the study may be conducted remotely.  If medically indicated, treatment with medication listed under Section  9.7.1 is no longer prohibited after study treatment discontinuation. 
Reasons for discontinuation from study treatment include but are not limited to: 
• Withdrawal by subject 
• Death  
• Lost to follow-up 
• Site termination by the Sponsor 
• Study termination by the Sponsor 
• AE 
• Pregnancy  
• Lack of efficacy  

Neurocrine Biosciences, Inc., Study No. NBI -827104- CSWS2010  
Clinical Protocol Amendment 3.0  
05 August  2021  Confidential  51 • Protocol deviation 
The investigator must discontinue study treatment dosing if the subject experiences any of the 
following: 
• If the type, frequency, or severity of any AE becomes unacceptable/intolerable, despite attempts to decrease the dose. 
• If the subject is unable to tolerate the lowest allowable study dose (ie, dose level 1).   
• QTcF value >500 msec (cardiologist verified) on any ECG tracing.  
• If the subject exhibits suicidal behavior, or suicidal ideation of type 4 (active suicidal ideation with some intent to act, without specific plan) or type 5 (active suicidal 
ideation with specific plan and intent) based on the C-SSRS, or in the opinion of the 
investigator. 
• Subject is confirmed to be pregnant. 
• Subject has any clinically  significant treatment-emergent ophthalmic finding. 
• Subject has any clinically significant treatment-emergent thyroid function test abnormality (TSH, T3 [free fraction], and T4 [free fraction]). 
The investigator or the Sponsor may discontinue study treatment dosing for other reasons including those described below.   
• Subject develops a clinically significant laboratory (eg, ALT or AST ≥2.5 times 
ULN) or ECG abnormality. 
• Subject requires a medication that is prohibited by the protocol. 
It is crucial to obtain follow-up data for any subject who discontinues study treatment dosing 
because of an AE, abnormal laboratory test, vital sign measurement, physical and neurological 
examination, ECG finding, or ophthalmic evaluation.  In any case, every effort must be made to 
undertake safety follow-up procedures. 
9.8.2. Withdrawal from Study 
If a subject prematurely withdraws from the study, the investigator will record the reason for 
withdrawal on the relevant eCRF.  All subjects who withdraw from the study prematurely will be 
asked to have all early termination assessments performed. 
Reasons for withdrawal from study include, but are not limited to: 
• Withdrawal by the subject 
• Adverse Event  
• Death  
• Lost to follow-up 
• Site terminated by Sponsor 
• Study terminated by Sponsor

9.8.3. Sponsor’s Termination or Pause of Study  
The Sponsor reserves the right to discontinue or pause the study overall or at the level of 
individual sites at any time for clinical or administrative reasons.  Study termina tion must be 
implemented by the investigator, if instructed to do so by the Sponsor in a time frame that is compatible with the subjects’ well-being. 
10. STUDY TREATMENT  
10.1. Study Treatment Supplies  
10.1.1. NBI-827104 
The Sponsor or its designee will provide the study center with a supply of NBI-827104 minitablets sufficient for the completion of the treatment period of the study.  
10.1.2. Placebo/Reference Drug  
The Study Sponsor or its designee will provide the study center with a supply of matching 
placebo minitablets sufficient for the completion of the treatment period of the study. 
10.2. Study Treatment Storage  
Formulated NBI-827104 and placebo minitablets  
   
The investigator should refer to the label of the study treatment for information on the storage conditions. 
Study treatment should be stored and inventoried according to applicable local and federal 
regulations and study procedures. 
10.3. Study Treatment Packaging and Labeling 
Each bottle of NBI-827104 or matching placebo will be supplied with a minitablet dispensing device.  Instructions on use of the device for dosing will be provided in the Pharmacy Manual. 
Study treatment will be labeled to comply with the applicable laws and regulations of the 
countries in which the study sites are located.  
10.4. Direct-to -Subject Shipments of Study Treatment  
To ensure continued access to study treatment, if a subject is unable to go to the site when study 
treatment is to be dispensed, study treatment may be delivered from the site’s pharm acy to the 
subject’s residence by a distributor independent from the Sponsor. The subject’s name, address, 
and other contact details will not be accessible to the Sponsor, and the distributor will not have access to the subject’s health information.

05 August  2021  Confidential  53 10.5. Blinding  
This study includes up to  of double-blind, placebo-controlled treatment during which 
the subject, investigator, and all study center personnel will be blinded to the subject’s treatment.  
The Sponsor will be blinded except for supply chain personnel who are not involved in decisions regarding subject treatment.  During this treatment period, all subjects will receive NBI -827104 
or placebo to be self- administered once daily.  
The randomization code will be broken for an individual subject only if the subject is pregnant, experiences an SAE that the investigator feels cannot be adequately treated without knowing the 
subject’s treatment assignment, or for regulatory reporting requirements.  In the case of a 
medical emergency in which knowledge of the identity of the study treatment is important for subject management, the investigator has the responsibility for unblinding the randomized 
treatment assignment using an Interactive We b Response System.  It is recommended that the 
investigator contact the Study Medical Monitor (or designee) before unblinding if it would not 
result in unnecessary delay to the immediate medical management of the subject.  Documentation of the unblinding must be maintained. 
Members of the IDMC and individuals who generate the IDMC reports and the independent 
vendor providing the PK analysis will be unblinded throughout the study. 
10.6. Study Treatment Preparation and Administration  
NBI-827104 will be provided as minitablets  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
10.7. Study Treatment Compliance and Accountability  
Subjects/caregivers will bring all unused study treatment and empty drug packaging material to the center at specified study visits for drug accountability and reconciliation by study center 
personnel.  A compliance check will be performed by weighing the container with the 
minitablets returned at each study visit.  
The quantity of study treatment dispensed, used, and returned will be recorded on a dispensing 
log or otherwise documented.  The quantity of study treatment lost or destroyed must also be 
accounted for and documented.  The designated pharmacist or qualified personnel will be

05 August  2021  Confidential  54 responsible for maintaining accurate records of the quantity and dates of all study treatment 
supplies received, dispensed, and returned. 
10.8. Study Treatment Return  
Returns will be shipped to NBI or its designee at the completion of the study according to instructions provided by NBI or its designee according to applicable state and federal regulations and study procedures.  
11. ADVERSE EVENTS  
All AEs, whether observed by the investigator, reported by the subject, noted from laboratory findings, or identified by other means, will be recorded from the time the ICF has been signed until the subject’s final s tudy visit (or upon early termination). 
11.1. Definition  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this tre atment.  An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign 
(including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal p roduct. 
AEs include, but are not limited to: (1) a worsening or change in nature, severity, or frequency of conditions present at the start of the study; (2) subject deterioration beyond what would be expected due to primary illness; (3) intercurrent illne ss; and (4) drug interaction. 
All suicidal behaviors and clinically significant suicidal ideations will be documented as an AE.  
Subjects should be questioned in a general way, without asking about the occurrence of any specific symptom.  The investigator should attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on 
signs, symptoms, and/or other clinical information.  In such cases, the diagnosis should be 
documented as the AE and not the individual signs/symptoms.  Following questioning and evaluation, all AEs, whether believed by the investigator to be related or unrelated to the study 
treatment, must be documented in the subject’s medical records, in accordance with the 
investigator’s normal clinical practice and on the AE eCRF.  Each AE is to be evaluated for duration, intensity, frequency, seriousness, outcome, other actions taken, and relationship to the study treatment.  
The following are not considered AEs: 
• Continuous persistent disease/symptom present before drug administration, unless it 
unexpectedly progresses, or increases in severity following drug administration 
• Seizures will not be considered AEs unless there is a significant increase in seizure frequency, there is a new seizure type, occurrence of status epilepticus, and/or in the investigator’s opinion it should be captured as an AE. 
• Treatment failure or lack of efficacy  
Neurocrine Biosciences, Inc., Study No. NBI -827104- CSWS2010  
Clinical Protocol Amendment 3.0  
05 August  2021  Confidential  55 • Pregnancy  
• Overdose of either study treatment or concomitant medication without any clinical 
signs or symptoms. 
11.1.1. Intensity of Adverse Events  
AEs must be graded for intensity.  An intensity category of mild, moderate, or severe, as defined 
in Table 4, must be entered on the AE eCRF.  It should be noted that the term “severe” used to 
grade intensity is not synonymous with the term “serious.” 
Table 4: I ntensity of Adverse Events  
Grade  Intensity  
Mild  An adverse event that is usually transient and may require only minimal treatment 
or therapeutic intervention.  The event does not generally interfere with usual 
activities of daily living.  
Moderate  An adverse event that is usually alleviated with additional specific therapeutic 
intervention.  The event interferes with usual activities of daily living, causing 
discomfort but poses no significant or permanent risk of harm to the research 
subje ct. 
Severe  An adverse event that interrupts usual activities of daily living, or significantly 
affects clinical status, or may require intensive therapeutic intervention.  
11.1.2. Relationship to Study treatment  
The investigator will document his/her opinion of the relationship of the AE to treatment with 
study treatment using the criteria outlined in  Table  5.  An AE is deemed associated with the use 
of the study treatment “if there is a reasonable possibility that the drug caused the AE” (otherwise referred to as a suspected adverse reaction).  Reasonable possibility means there is evidence to suggest a causal r elationship between the drug and the AE (Title 21 Code of Federal 
Regulations [CFR] 312.32 [a]). 
Neurocrine Biosciences, Inc., Study No. NBI -827104- CSWS2010  
Clinical Protocol Amendment 3.0  
05 August  2021  Confidential  56 Table 5: Relationship of Adverse Events to Study treatment  
Relationship  Description  
Definite  A reaction that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration 
of the drug or in which the drug level has been established in body fluids or 
tissue; that follows a known or expected response pattern to the suspected drug; and that is confirmed by improvement on stopping or reducing the dosage of the drug, and reappearance of the reaction on repeated exposure. 
Possible  An adverse event in which there is reasonable possibility that the drug caused the event.  Reasonable possibility means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the adverse event. 
Unlikely  A reaction that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the drug; that follows a known or suspected response pattern to the suspected drug; but that could reasonably be explained by known characteristics of the subject’s clinical state.  
Not Related  Any event that does not meet the above criteria. 
11.2. Recording Adverse Events  
For randomized subjects, each AE will be listed as a separate entry on an AE eCRF.  Screen failure subjects will have AE information noted only in the source document.  The investigator (or designee) will provide information on dates of onset and resolution, intensity, seriousness, 
frequency, action(s) taken, changes in study treatment usage, relationship to study treatment, and 
outcome.   
The following categories of medical events that could occur during participation in a clinical 
study must be reported within 24 hours to the Sponsor or its designee: 
• SAE, including death 
• Pregnancy  
• Treatment unblinding for any reason 
• Events of suicidal behavior or suicidal ideation type 4 (active suicidal ideation with some intent to act, without specific plan) or type 5 (active suicidal ideation with specific plan and intent) based on the C- SSRS.  
11.3. Poststudy Follow-Up of Adverse Events  
All AEs, including clinically significant changes in ECGs, physical and neurological examination findings, or isolated clinically significant laboratory findings must be followed until 
the event resolves, the condition stabilizes, the event is otherwise explained, or the subject is lost 
to follow-up.

Clinical Protocol Amendment 3.0  
05 August  2021  Confidential  57 AEs ongoing at the final visit or at early termination will be followed for as long as necessary to 
adequately evaluate the subject’s safety or until the event stabilizes  or resolves or until the 
subject is lost to follow -up.  The investigator is responsible for ensuring that follow-up includes 
any supplemental investigations as may be indicated to elucidate the nature and/or causality of the AE.  This may include additional laboratory tests or investigations, histopathological 
examinations, or consultation with other health care professionals, as is practical. 
11.4. Serious Adverse Events  
All SAEs will be recorded from the time the ICF has been signed until the final study visit.   
Investigators are not obligated to actively seek SAEs after a subject has withdrawn from or 
completed the study. However, if the investigator learns of any SAE, including a death, at any time after a subject has been withdrawn from or has completed the study, and the investigator 
considers the event to be reasonably related to the study intervention or study participation, the 
investigator must promptly notify the Sponsor as described in Section  11.4.3. 
11.4.1. Definition of a Serious Adverse Event  
An SAE is any AE that results in any of the following outcome: 
• Death.  
• A life -threatening AE.  Life-threatening means that the subject was, in the view of the 
investigator or Sponsor, at immediate risk of death from the reaction as it occurred.  It 
does not mean that hypothetically the event might have caused death if it occurred in 
a more serious form.  
• Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospi talization.  Hospitalization 
for elective treatment or a pre-existing condition that did not worsen during the clinical investigation is not considered an AE.  Hospitalization or nursing home 
admission for the purpose of caregiver respite is not considered an AE.  
Complications that occur during hospitalization are AEs, and if a complication prolongs hospitalization, the event is considered serious.  Treatment in a hospital emergency room is not a hospitalization. 
• A persistent or significant incapacity or s ubstantial disruption of a person’s ability to 
conduct normal life functions. 
• A congenital anomaly/birth defect. 
• Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospitalization.  These events may be considered serious when, based on appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the health of the subject and may require 
medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed.  Any other 
event thought by the investigator to be serious should also be reported, following the reporting requirements detailed in this section.  Examples of such medical events 
include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or 
at home, blood dyscrasias, convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.

Clinical Protocol Amendment 3.0  
05 August  2021  Confidential  58 11.4.2. Managing Serious Adverse Events 
Subjects experiencing an SAE or an emergency situation will be examined by a physician as 
soon as possible.  The physician in attendance will do whatever is medically needed for the 
safety and well -being of the subject.  The subject will remain under observation as long as 
medically indicated.  Appropriate laboratory studies will be conducted until all parameters return 
to normal or are otherwise explain ed or stable.  The subject will be followed until the SAE 
resolves or until the subject is medically stabilized.  The investigator (or designee) will notify the 
study Medical Monitor or designee (and the IRB/IEC, if necessary) immediately (within 24 hours) of the SAE and the outcome of the SAE. 
11.4.3. Reporting Serious Adverse Events and Other Immediately Reportable Events  
SAEs and other immediately reportable events (defined in Section  11.2) must be reported within 
24 hours of first knowledge of the event by study personnel to the Sponsor (contact information 
provided on the respective forms).  Reports of SAEs and pregnancies must be followed by a fax 
or email of the SAE or Pregnancy Form.  It is important that the investigator provides his or her assessment of relationship to study treatment at the time of the initial SAE report.  
For SAEs and pregnancies, contact Drug Safety and Pharmacovigilance (DSPV) ( Table 6).  
Treatment unblinding and events of suicidal behavior or suicidal ideation type 4 or 5 based on the C -SSRS (or based on clinical impression for subj ects under 6  years) should be reported to the 
Study Medical Monitor.

11.4.4. Expedited Safety Reports  
The Sponsor or its representatives will submit an Expedited Safety Report for any suspected 
adverse reaction (as defined in Section  11.1.2) that is considered both serious and unexpected 
within 15 calendar days and for any unexpect ed fatal or life-threatening experience within 
7 calendar days to the applicable regulatory authority(ies); or according to country- specific 
regulations. 
The Sponsor or its representatives will send copies of each safety report submitted to regulatory 
authorities to the investigators.  The safety report must be submitted to the appropriate IRB/IEC 
as soon as possible.  Documentation of the submission to the IRB/IEC and receipt by the 
IRB/IEC (if applicable) must be retained for each safety report.

Clinical Protocol Amendment 3.0  
05 August  2021  Confidential  59 11.5. Pregnancy  
Pregnancy is neither an AE nor an SAE unless the criteria for an SAE are met.  However, all 
pregnancies in female subjects who received NBI -827104 will be followed to assess for 
congenital anomaly.  Subjects of childbearing potential must be counseled at all visits to 
continue using birth control (see inclusion criterion #4 in Section  8.1) until 90 days after the last 
dose of study treatment.  If at any time between the time the ICF is signed and the last study visit, a subject (or the subject’s parent/legal guardian) believes she is pregnant, the subject will be instructed to return to the study center within 24 hours and undergo a serum pregnancy test to confirm pregnancy.  
All confirmed pregnancies in subjects who received study treatment must be immediately 
reported to the Sponsor, followed by fax or email of the pregnancy form.  A firs t trimester 
ultrasound may be requested for all confirmed pregnancies.  Pregnancies in subjects who received NBI -827104 will be followed until resolution (ie, termination [voluntary or 
spontaneous] or birth). 
12. DOCUMENTATION OF DATA  
12.1. Case Report Forms  
The eCR F data for this study are being collected with an electronic data capture (EDC) system.  
The EDC system and the study- specific eCRFs will comply with Title 21 CFR Part 11.  The 
documentation related to the validation of the EDC system is available through the EDC vendor, while the validation of the study specific eCRFs will be conducted by the Sponsor and the required documentation will be maintained in the Trial Master File.  
The investigator will document subject data in his/her own subject files.  These s ubject files will 
serve as source data for the study.  All eCRF data required by this protocol will be recorded by 
authorized study personnel in the EDC system, with the exception of data captured in an 
electronic format, which will be loaded electronically into the appropriate eCRFs.  All data entered into the eCRF will be supported by source documentation.  The eCRF for each subject 
must be reviewed by the investigator and electronically signed on the appropriate eCRF page(s).  
This should be done as soon as possible after the subject completes the study.   
The investigator or an authorized member of the investigator's staff will make any necessary 
additions/corrections to the eCRF.  All change information, including the date, person 
performing the correct ions, and reason for the change will be available via the electronic audit 
trail, which is part of the EDC system.  The eCRFs will be reviewed periodically for 
completeness, legibility, and acceptability by the Sponsor (or designee).  The Sponsor will also 
be allowed access to all source documents and medical records pertinent to the study in order to verify eCRF entries.  The Principal Investigator will review the eCRFs for completeness and accuracy and enter his or her electronic signature on the eCRFs as  evidence thereof.  
The EDC vendor will provide access to the Sponsor portal of the EDC system for the duration of the study through a password- protected method of internet access.  Such access will be removed 
from study centers at the end of the center’s participation in the study.  Data from the EDC system will be archived on appropriate data media (or provided via a secure transfer mechanism)

Clinical Protocol Amendment 3.0  
05 August  2021  Confidential  60 and provided to the investigator at that time as a durable record of the center’s eCRF data.  
Although not required, the investigator may make paper printouts of the data. 
All clinical work conducted under this protocol is subject to GCP regulations.  This includes an 
inspection by the Sponsor and/or health authority representatives at any time.  The Principal 
Investigator will agree to the inspection of study-related records by health authority 
representatives and/or the Sponsor. 
12.2. Data Capture, Review, and Validation  
Data entered in the EDC system will be verified against the source data by the Sponsor (or 
designee).  Any discrepancies will be corrected online by authorized study center personnel.  
Automated (computer-generated) logic checks will run in order to identify items such as inconsistent study dates.  In addition, manual review/checks may be performed by the Sponsor 
on the data.  Any inconsistencies/errors/omissions identified will be sent to the study center (via 
an electronic query) for the necessary corrections to be made to the eCRF.  Once entered and saved in an eCRF, data immediately become part of the study database and are available to the Sponsor. 
12.3. Coding Dictionaries  
AEs and medical history will be coded using the chosen version of the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA).  Prior and concomitant medications will be coded using the chosen version of the World Health Organization Drug Dictionary (WHO Drug).  
13. STATISTICAL AND ANALYTICAL PLAN 
13.1. Overview  
The analysis plan provided in this protocol represents a brief description of the planned analyses.  
The comprehensive statist ical analysis plan (SAP) will be generated prior to final study database 
lock.  The SAP may include a number of additional analyses and data summaries not described 
in this protocol. 
 
. 
13.2. Analysis Sets  
Four analysis sets are defined:  
• Full Analysis Set (FAS)  
This analysis set includes all randomized subjects who took at least one dose of study treatment and have at least one efficacy video -EEG assessment.  Subjects will be analyzed 
according to their randomized treatment group. 

Neurocrine Biosciences, Inc., Study No. NBI -827104- CSWS2010  
Clinical Protocol Amendment 3.0  
05 August  2021  Confidential  61 • Per-protocol set  
This analysis set includes all randomized subjects who completed at least 6 weeks of 
treatment without protocol deviations that may affect the evaluation of the primary 
endpoint. Subjects will be analyzed according to their randomized treatment group. 
Details regarding the specific protocol deviations or criteria that will exclude subjects from the per- protocol set will be defined in the SAP.  
• Safety set  
All subjects who received at least one dose of study treatment in the study will be included in the Safety set.  The Safety set is the primary analysis population for safety assessments. Subjects will be analyzed according to the study treatment they received.  
• Pharmacokinetic set  
This analysis set comprises all subjects included in the Safety set who had at least one 
evaluable plasma concentration after initiation of NBI -827104 and did not deviate from 
the protocol in a way that might affect the evaluation of the PK endpoint. The PK set will 
be employed in the analysis of the PK parameters. 
13.3. Sample Size  Determination  
The sample size is based on the primary endpoint, expressed as a ratio of SWI at the end of 
 to baseline.   A ratio to baseline was preferred over an absolute or relative change from 
baseline, because of the better statistical propertie s of the former.   
The associated summary statistic on a treatment group level is the geometric mean ratio (GMR) to baseline (obtained by exponentiating the mean of the log- transformed ratios).  A GMR <1 
indicates an improvement from baseline in the treatment group. 
The treatment effect is expressed as a ratio of ratios: the GMR in the NBI -827104 group divided 
by the GMR in the placebo group.   
 
 
 
 
 
These numbers will provide the following power to detect a difference in the primary endpoint 
between NBI -827104 and placebo at  (at a two- sided α=0.10) as presented in Table 7 .

13.4. Handling of Missing Data  
All available study data will be included in relevant summaries and data displays, including any 
available data for subjects with incomplete or missing data.  Missing data for the primary 
efficacy endpoint (ratio of SWI at the end of   to baseline) will be imputed using last 
observation carried forward. Any methods of handling missing data in the secondary and other endpoints will be specified in the SAP. 
13.5. Disposition of Subjects  
A summar y of subject disposition will be prepared that displays the number of subjects who 
were randomized, received study treatment, and completed the study.  The number of subjects who did not complete the study will be displayed both overall and by reason for discontinuation. 
13.6. Important Protocol Deviations  
A summary of the number and percentage of subjects with important protocol deviations by deviation category and by treatment group will be provided for all randomized subjects. 
13.7. Demographics and Baseline Subject  Characteristics  
Age, height/length, weight, body mass index, gender, race, and ethnicity will be summarized with descriptive statistics or frequency tables as appropriate.  
13.8. Study Treatment Dosing and Compliance  
The average daily dose of study treatment wil l be summarized using descriptive statistics over 
the periods corresponding to each dose level (ie, ) for 
each body weight category.  The cumulative dose of study treatment taken over the entire study period will also be summarized.

taken) will be summarized with descriptive statistics by visit and for the full treatment period.  
13.9. Pharmacokinetic Parameters  
PK analyses will be perf ormed using the pharmacokinetic analysis set.  PK parameters will be 
calculated using non- compartmental methods.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
13.10.  Efficacy Data  
Primary efficacy endpoint: 
• Ratio of SWI a t the end of  to baseline  during the first hour (60 minutes) of 
NREM sleep based on centralized video -EEG reading, where baseline is defined as 
the last value measured prior to intake of study treatment on Day 1. 
The primary endpoint was selected bas ed on the observation of highest SWI during the first 
NREM sleep phases compared with the last ( Bölsterli Heinzle et al., 2014 ), as well as 
demonstrated sensitivity and responsiveness in a retrospective review of video- EEG data 
collected in a patient population of children with EECSWS ( Aeby  et al., 2005).  
Secondary efficacy endpoints: 
• Ratio of SWI at the end of  to baseline during the first hour (60 minutes) of 
NREM sleep, based on centralized evaluation. 
• Caregiver GI -C and CGI- C scores at the end of  
• Change from baseline to the end of  in CGI- S scores.

pulse rate), ECG parameters (QTcF, HR, PR interval, QRS duration), and C- SSRS will be 
summarized.  The number (%) of subjects with marked ECG abnormalities will be tabulated.  
13.12.  Sentinel Cohort Analysis  
The first 6 subjects (randomized 2:1; ie, 4 subjects randomized to NBI-827104 and 2 subjects randomized to placebo) will be enrolled into a sentinel cohort for the analysis of safety, 
tolerability, and PK data through   Efficacy analyses will not be performed as part of this analysis,  
The unblinded analysis of safety and tolerability data for the sentinel cohort will be conducted by the IDMC.  The analysis of the PK data through  in the sentinel cohort will be conducted 
by an independent, unblinded vendor; this vendor will provide reports to the Sponsor and the 
IDMC.  Based on the tolerability and exposure data obtained from the sentinel cohort, the IDMC may recommend that doses and/or the escalation paradigm be adjusted to achieve the targeted 
exposure or improve tolerability.  Provisions will be made to ensure all Sponsor personnel 
remain blinded throughout the study. 
14. REGULATORY AND ETHICAL ISSUES

For non -EIAED subjec ts, 
target perampanel dose is 
lowered to 4  mg/day.  
Depending upon individual 
clinical response and tolerability, non-EIAED subjects could still have their perampanel dose up -titrated to 
6 mg/day.   Clarified that the 
maximum dose allowed will 
not change.  To reflect European Medicines

Primary Objective  
• To evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of perampanel during the Maintenance Period of the Core Study 
following oral suspension administration given as an adjunctive thera py in pediatric subjects from 
1 month to less than 4 years of age with epilepsy  (revis ed per Amendment  02) 
Secondary Objectives  
• To evaluate the short - and long -term safety and tolerability of perampanel oral suspension  given as an 
adjunctive therapy  in subjects from 1 month to less than 4 years of age with epilepsy  (revised per 
Amendment 02)  
• To evaluate the long- term effect of perampanel oral suspension , given as an adjunctive therapy , on 
growth from baseline to end of treatment in pediatric subjects from 1 month to less than 4 years of age 
with epilepsy  (revised p er Amendment 02)  
Exploratory Objective  
• To explore the short - and long -term efficacy of perampanel oral suspension  given as an adjunctive 
therapy  in subjects from 1 month to less than 4  years of age with epilepsy as assessed by :  (revised per 
Amendment 02)  
o Percent change in 28 -day seizure frequency during the Titration + Maintenance Periods compared 
to baseline and during the Extension Phase compared to baseline  
o Proportion of subjects with a 50% decrease in 28- day seizure frequency during the Maintenance 
Period compared to baseline and during the Extension Phase compared to baseline  
o Proportion of subjects who are seizure -free during the Maintenance Period and during the Extension 
Phase

 Study Design  
This will be a multicenter, open -label study with an extension phase that will enroll 16 to 24  pediatric subjects 
1 to less than 24 months of age and at least to a maximum of 26 pediatric subjects from 2 to less than 4  years 
of age with epilepsy.  (revised per Amendment 02)  
All subjects must be taking 1 to a maximum of 4 anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) to participate in the study.  For 
at least 6 but not more than 8  of the subjects  in the age group of 1 to less than 24 month s and for 13  subjects 
in the age group of 2 to less than 4 years  (across studies) , only 1 enzyme -inducing AED (ie, EIAEDs; 
carbamazepine [ CBZ ], oxcarbazepine [ OXC ], phenytoin [ PHT ], or eslicarbazepine [ESL]) out of the 
maximum of 4 AEDs will be allowed.  These subjects  will be referred to as  EIAED  subjects.  The remaining 
subjects cannot be taking any EI AEDs  and will be referred to as non-EIAE D subjects.  (revised per 
Amendment  02) 
For the age group of 1 to less than 24 months , the Sponsor will ensure a reasonable representation of subject 
age (ie, at least  6 subjects in the age range ≥1 to ≤6 months , at least 5  subjects in the age range >6 to 
≤12 months , at least 5 subjects in the age range >12 to <24 months ).  (revised per Amend ment 02) 
For the age group of 2 to less than 4 years, the required number of subjects (total of 26) can be pooled across 
multiple studies for PK and safety assessments.  Therefore, the  target number of subjects to be enrolled in this 
age group  ranges from a minimum of 1 to a maximum of 26 subjects.  Enrollment of subjects aged 2 to less 
than 4 years  into th is study  may be stopped upon notification of sponsor when the total number has been 
reached  across clinical studies, or when enrollment in t he 1 to less than 24 months  age group in this study has 
completed (ie, the original purpose of this study has been met).  (revised per Amendment 02)  
This study will consist of 3 phases:  Pretreatment and Treatment (Core Study), and Extension.  The 
Pretreat ment Phase will last up to 2  weeks, during which subjects will be assessed for their eligibility to 
participate in the study.  The Treatment Phase will consist of 3 periods:  Titration (12- 16 weeks), Maintenance 
(4 weeks), and Follow -up (4 weeks; only for those subjects who complete the Maintenance Period but do not 
continue into the Extension Phase).  The Extension Phase will consist of 2  periods:  Maintenance 
(32-36 weeks) and Follow -up (4 weeks).  (revised per Amendment  02) 
The maximum total duration of treatment for each subject will be  52 weeks and the maximum total duration 
of the study for each subject will be 58  weeks ( 2 weeks Pretreatment+52 weeks of treatment+4 week s 
Follow -up).  (revised per Amendment  02) 
Subjects  who complete the Extension Phase and who, in the opinion of the investigator, will likely  continue to 
demonstrate a positive benefit -to-risk ratio from treatment with perampanel may  be en rolled into an extended 
access program  (EAP) for perampane l if EAP is implemented for this age group in the country where the  
subject resides.   (revised per Amendment 02)  
Pretreatment Phase (Core Study)  
At the first visit of the Pretreatment Phase, 4  weeks of prescreening (ie, before Visit 1) seizure frequency data 
will be  collected for each subject as part of their medical history.  Upon successful completion of the 
Pretreatment Phase, eligible subjects will enter the Treatment Phase.

During the Treatment Phase, subjects will be dosed with pe rampanel oral suspension as follows:  
• Titration Period:   Subjects will start perampanel treatment at a dose of 0.50 mg/day and follow dose 
titration schemes up to 4 mg/day (non -EIAED subjects) or 8  mg/day (EIAED subjects).  Depending 
on individual subject’s clinical response and tolerability, non- EIAED subjects could still have the 
perampanel dose up- titrated to 6 mg/day.   Perampanel dose should not be further up- titrated beyond 
6 mg/day (non -EIAED subjects) or 8  mg/day ( EIAE D subjects) unless there is a medical need (for 
example, a subject who tolerated perampanel well but have not reached optimal seizure control).  
Before  dose up- titrations beyond 6  mg/day (non -EIAED subjects) or 8 mg/day (EIAED subjects) and 
whenever practi cally feasible, it is recommended to take a blood sample for the measurement of 
plasma perampanel level as a precautionary measure.  The date and time of the last perampanel dose

 administration, as well as the date and time of PK blood draw, for these unsc heduled PK sample 
collection will be recorded .  Up-titrations of perampanel dose within the range of 0.5 to 6 mg/day will 
be at 1 -week intervals; and at doses greater than 6  mg/day will be at 2 -week intervals  (see Study 
Treatment( s) section).  Dose titrations must  not exceed 12  mg/day (non -EIAED subjects) or 
16 mg/day ( EIAED subjects) .  The decision to up -titrate perampanel dose will be at the investigator ’s 
discretion, based on individual subject ’s clinical response and/or tolerability to achieve optimal dose 
for a given subject.  Once the optimal dose has been achieved, the subject ’s dose will be maintained 
stable for the remaining Titration Period or at least 2  weeks before entering the Maintenance Period.  
(revised per Amendment 02)  
• Maintenance Pe riod:   During the Maintenance Period, subjects will continue taking perampanel oral 
suspension at the dose level they achieved at the end of the Titration Period.  The maximum total daily 
dose a subject will be allowed is 12  mg for non -EIAED subjects and 1 6 mg for EIAED  subjects .  
(revised per Amendment 02)  
• Follow-U p Period:   Subjects will not receive study drug during this period.   Subjects who do not 
continue into the Extension Phase after completing the Maintenance Period, or those who discontinue 
early from the study  will be r equired to complete the Follow-u p Period after their last dose in the 
Treatment Phase.  Subjects who switch to commercially available perampanel or who enter into EAP 
upon completion of study treatment  need not to undergo Follow -up Visit; however , sites will conduct 
a telephone contact 28 (+6) days after the last dose of study drug to follow adverse events ( AEs)  and 
report any serious adverse events ( SAEs ) that occur within 28 days of the last study drug 
administration.  (revised per  Amendment 02)  
After every 4th subject in the age group 1 to less than 24 months completes the Maintenance Period , an interim 
analysis (safety, tolerability, and PK) will be conducted where by dose-normalized exposure will be compared 
to that observed in ot her studies in subjects  between ≥ 2 and < 18 years of age.   If the exposure of the subjects 
is significantly different from that observed in subjects ages ≥2 to <12 years from  other clinical studies or that  
are predicted from PK modeling and simulation, or i f non -linear PK is observed, the sample size will be 
increased to at least 24 subjects with evaluable PK data, and the target dose or dosing regimen of those subjects 
may be modified via protocol amendment , depending on the PK of the previous subjects.   PK data collected in 
older age cohort (2 to less than 4 years) will also be examined in the interim PK analyses.   (revised per 
Amendment 02)  
Preliminary PK analysis was performed based on data obtained from 7 subjects (>6 to <24 months of age; 
6 subjects without concomitant EIAED and 1 subject on concomitant EIAED) in this study and pooled with 
existing data from 2336 subjects  (aged 2 to 77 ye ars).  Preliminary PK findings suggest that oral clearance in 
subjects aged less than 24 months  without concomitant  EIAED appears to be approximately 40% of that in 
subjects aged ≥  2 years.  It is predicted that a daily dose of 6 mg or 8 mg in subjects aged less than  24 months 
without or with concomitant EIAED, respectively, will result in comparable exposure to that in subjects aged 
>2 years receiving a daily dose of 12 mg (non-EIAED subjects)  or 16 mg (EIAED  subjects) , respectively.  
However, European Medicines Agency/Paediatric Committee (EMA/PDCO) recommended that perampanel 
dose should be titrated up to a target dose of 4 mg/day for non -EIAED subjects (EMEA -000467- PIP01 -08-
M13), which could be further titrated up to 6 mg/day depending on individual subject’s clinical response and 
tolerability. Therefore, the target dose in this study is revised to 4 mg/day (non -EIAE D subjects) and 8 mg/day 
(EIAED  subjects)  in subjects less than 24 months  of age , while the maximum dose allowed remains as 
12 mg/day and 16  mg/day for non -EIAED and EIAED subjects, respectively.  (revised per Amendment 02)  
In subjects 2 to less than 4 years of age, there were very limited PK data (n=4) to allow adequate evaluation of 
effect of age on perampanel PK.  Therefore, the same target dose and dos e titration approach  will be followed 
for non -EIAED and EIAED subjects aged 2 to less than 4 years  as described above for 1  to less than 2 4 months  
subjects.   (revised per Amendment 02)

of study treatment .  For these subjects , sites will conduct a telephone contact 28 (+6) days after the 
last dose of study drug to follow AEs and report any SAEs that occur within 28 days of the last study 
drug administration .  (revised per Amendment 02)  
Data Monitoring Committee  
An independent data monitoring committee (DMC) will be constructed to monitor the safety data of this study.   
Number of Subjects  
1 month to <24 months of age:  At least 16 subject s with evaluable PK data , of which at least 6  subjects are in 
the age range ≥1 to ≤6 months, at least 5 subjects are in the age range >6 to ≤12 months , and at least 5 subjects 
are in the age range > 12 to <24 months .  The target number of subjects with EIAED are at least 6 but not more 
than 8 subjects across these 3 age subgroups.   (revised per Amendment 02)  
2 years to <4 years of age:  A total of 26 subjects (13 EIAED and 13  non-EIAED)  to be enrolled and  pooled 
across clinical studies of perampanel with PK data .  Therefore, the target number of subjects to be enrolled in 
this age group in this study  ranges from a minimum of 1 to a maximum of 26 subjects .  (revised per

 Study Treatment(s)  
Test drug  
Perampanel will be provided as 0.5 mg/mL oral suspension stock.  Dosing should occur once daily before 
bedtime in the evening, unless otherwise specified.  
Study treatments are to be administered as follows:  
Pretreatment and Treatment Phase (Core Study)  
Pretreatment Phase:  Subjects will not receive study drug during this phase.  
Treatment Phase:  
• Titration Period ( 12-16 weeks):  S ubjects will start perampanel treatment at a dose of 0.50 mg/day 
and follow  dose titration  schemes up to 4 mg/day (non -EIAED subjects) or 8 mg/day (EIAED 
subjects).  Depending on individual subject’s clinical response and tolerability, non -EIAED subjects 
could still have the perampanel dose up -titrated to 6 mg/day.   Perampanel dose should not be further 
up-titrated beyond 6  mg/day (non -EIAED subjects) or 8 mg/day (EIAED subjects) unless there is a 
medical need (for example, a subject who tolerated perampanel well but have not reached optimal 
seizure control).  Before dose up -titrations beyond 6 mg/day (non -EIAED subjects) or 8 mg/day 
(EIAED subjects) and whenever practically feasible,  it is recommended to take a blood sample for 
the measurement of plasma perampanel level as a precautionary measure.  The date and time o f the 
last perampanel dose administration, as well as the date and time of PK blood draw, for these unscheduled PK sample collection will be recorded.  Up- titrations of perampanel dose within the 
range of 0.5 to 6 mg/day will be at 1 -week intervals; and at doses greater than 6 mg/day will be at 
2-week intervals  (see Study Treatment( s) section)  Dose titrations must  not exceed 12 mg/day (non-
EIAED subjects) or 16  mg/day (EIAED subjects)).  The decision to up- titrate perampanel dose will be 
at the investigator’s discretion, based on individual subject’s clinical response and/or tolerability to achieve optimal dose for a given subject.  Once the optimal dose has been achieved, the subject’s dose will be maintained stable for the remaining Titration Period or at l east 2 weeks before entering the 
Maintenance Period.  (revised per Amendment 02)  
According to the investigator’s clinical judgment subjects experiencing intolerability at any dose may remain at the same dose or have their dose decreased one dose level down to the previously tolerated 
dose.  If the subject continues to present significa nt intolerable AEs at the decreased dose and the 
investigator deems it is necessary, the dose can be decreased further to the next dose level down.  
Dose decreases can be done via telephone.  Subjects whose dose has been decreased can have their 
dose increased again if tolerability improves.  This must be  done at the next clinic visit after the 
investigator has deemed it is appropriate in view of the resolution of the AE(s).  Multiple dose 
adjustments will be allowed during the Titration Period.  Every effo rt should be made to have subjects 
achieve their optimal dose, not to exceed a maximum dose of 12 mg/day (non- EIAED  subjects) or  
16 mg/day ( EIAED subjects) during the Titration Period.  (revised per Amendment 02)  
• Maintenance Period (4 weeks):  During this period, subjects will continue taking perampanel oral 
suspension at the dose level they achieved at the end of the Titration Period.  
Adjustment of the dose level during the Maintenance Period should be discouraged; however, 
according to the investigator’s clinical judgment, subjects experiencing intolerable AE(s) will be 
allowed to have their dose decreased to the previously tolerated dose.  During the Maintenance Period, subjects whose dose has been decreased cannot have their dose increased again.   A subj ect may not 
decrease their dose more than once during Maintenance Period unless there is a significant medical reason and with approval from the Medical Monitor.  
During the entire Titration and Maintenance Periods, all dose adjustments will be done via 1 d ose 
titration level up or down  (relevant to where the subject is within the study) .  Subjects who do not 
tolerate a dose of 0.50 mg/day will be discontinued from the study.  The maximum total daily dose a 
subject will be allowed is 12 mg ( non-EIAED  subjects) or 16 mg ( EIAED  subjects) .

 Dosing Modifications  
After every 4th subject in the age group 1 to less than 24 months completes the Maintenance Period , 
an interim analysis (safety, tolerability, and PK) will be conducted and reviewed by the Eisai study 
team to decide if dosing modifications are required for additional subjects who enroll in the study.  If 
the exposure of the subjects is significantly different from that observed in subjects ages ≥2 to <12 
years from  other clinical stud ies or that are predicted from PK modeling and simulation, or if non -
linear PK is observed, the target dose or dosing regimen of those subjects may be modified via a 
protocol amendment, depending on the PK of the previous subjects.   PK data collected in older age 
cohort (2 to less than 4 years) will also be examined in the interim PK analyses.   (revised per

Concomitant Drug/Therapy  
Subjects will be taking 1 to a maximum of 4 marketed AEDs (see inclusion criteria 6  and 7 and exclusion 
criteria 6 through 8 for further details).  Changes of baseline AEDs (addition, deletion, or adjustment in dose) 
will not be allowed during 5 half -lives  or during the 2 wee ks, whichever is longer,  before Visit 1.   During the 
Core study, dose adjustments will be allowed only for non -EIAEDs.  Dose adju stments of EIAEDs and 
addition/deletion of any concomitant AEDs are not allowed during the Core study.   Use of cannabidiol  (CBD ) 
products is allowed and is counted as 1 of the 4 maximum allowed concomitant AEDs.  CBD dose and product 
must have remained stable for at least 2 weeks before Visit 1 and is to remain the same throughout the course 
of the Core Study.  (revised per Amendment 02)  
The following medications will not be permitted  (revised per Amendment 02) : 
• Medications known to be inducers of cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A) (other than CBZ, OXC, PHT, or 
ESL)  including, but not limited to:  rifampin, troglitazone, St John’s Wort, efavirenz, nevirapine, 
barbiturates (except for use as an AED), glucocorticoids (other  than topical usage), modafinil, 
pioglitazone, and rifabutin within 2 weeks or 5 half- lives, whichever is longer, before Visit 1 and 
throughout the course of the study [Core and Extension])  
• Felbamate (within 8 weeks before Visit 1 and throughout the course  of the study [Core and Extension])  
• Vigabatrin(within 2 week s before Visit 1 and throughout the course of the study [Core and Extension])  
In case of an emergency, subjects may receive other AEDs, including diazepam as well as other appropriate 
AEDs as resc ue medications, to treat status epilepticus, uncontrolled seizures, or seizure clusters.  
For any drug known to influence the CNS  (other than AEDs for epilepsy), the dose should be kept stable for 
2 weeks or 5 half -lives, whichever is longer, before Visit 1  and throughout the course of the study (Core and 
Extension) .  (revised per Amendment 02)  
Subjects are not permitted to participate in another study involving administration of an investigational drug or device for the full duration of this study (ie, up to and including the Follow -up Visit).
 
Assessments  
Efficacy Assessments  
Efficacy will be assessed by seizure counts and types as recorded on a study specific seizure diary , and by 
CGI-C. 
Pharmacokinetic Assessments  (Core Study only)  
Blood samples (1.0  mL) for plasma will be collected from all subjects at prespecified visits for the 
determination of perampanel plasma concentrations .  On the day of PK sampling, subjects will attend the clinic 
any time during the day to provide blood sampling for PK analysis and to enable close monitoring of the subjects for safety and tolerability.  The resulting plasma sample will be aliquoted into 2 Microtainer® tubes.  
 
For subjects aged 1 to less than 24 months, dosing should occur once daily before bedtime in the evening.  The dosing date and time of the last 3 doses before each PK visit will be recorded.  (revised per Amendment 02)  
For subjects aged 2 to less than 4 ye ars, dosing should occur once daily before bedtime in the evening, including

EIAED subjects), as 2 PK samples (1 predose and 1 early postdose [within 1 to 5 hours after dosing]) ar e to be 
collected, the following steps are to be followed  (revised per Amendment 02) : 
• Study drug administration  in the evening immediately before the PK visits during Maintenance Period 
will be withheld .  All other AEDs should be administered per the subje ct’s usual AED regimen.   
• During each of the Maintenance Period PK visits, collect predose PK sample.  Then administer study 
drug on site, followed by early postdose PK sample collection (within 1 to 5 hours after dose 
administration).  
• Bedtime dosing will resume beginning in the evening of the Maintenance Period PK visits.  
• The dosing date and time of the study drug dose administered on -site during each Maintenance Period  
PK visit, as well as the last 2 doses before will be recorded.

Analyses  
Analysis Sets  
The Pharmacokinetic Analysis Set is the group of subjects with at least 1 PK assessment of perampanel  during 
the Maintenance Period and who have a documented dosing history.  
The Safety Analysis Set is the group of subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug and had at least 
1 postdose safety assessment.  
The Full Analysis Set (FAS) is the g roup of subjects who received study drug and had any seizure frequency 
data during the 2 weeks of Pretreatment Phase plus 4  weeks before Pretreatment Phase and dur ing the 
Treatment Phase.   
Efficacy Analyses  
Exploration of efficacy will be performed on the FAS.  Summary statistics will be displayed for all efficacy 
parameters.  
Pharmacokinetic, Pharmacodynamic, and Pharmacogenomic/ Pharmacogenetic Analyses  
Pharmacokinetic Analyses  
Determination of PK will be performed on the PK Analysis Set.  Perampanel plasma concentrations will be 
listed.  
A population PK approach will be used to characterize the PK of perampanel.  The effect of intrinsic and extrinsic fact ors ( age, body weight, gender, race, ALT, AST, creatinine clearance and concomitant therapy 
with carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, valproic acid, lamotrigine, topiramate, 
primidone, zonisamide, levetiracetam and primidone ) on perampan el PK will be evaluated.   A 2-compartment 
disposition PK model with linear elimination will be parameterized for absorption rate, oral clearance,  and 
apparent central and peripheral volume s of distribution.   Derived exposure parameters such as the steady s tate 
peak concentration (C max,ss), area under concentration vs time curve at steady state (AUC ss), and average 
steady -state drug concentration (Css,av) will be calculated using the individual posterior estimates of P K 
parameters from the final PK model .  Descriptive statistics of the individual model -predicted PK parameters 
(including but not limited to C max,ss) will be provided.   
Due to the small sample size, population PK analysis will be performed using NONMEM with first -order 
conditional estimation with interaction on data from this study pooled with existing rich data from 19 Phase 1 studies and spare data from 2 Phase 2 studies (232 and 235), and 5 Phase 3 Studies (304, 305, 306, 332 and 335).  A 2-compartment PK model will be fitted to the data and the effect of intrinsic and extrinsic factors, 
including body weight and age, on the PK of perampanel will be evaluated. The post -hoc estimates of both, 
maximum observed concentration (C
max) and AUC from the final PK mode will be derived for all subjects . 
Subsequently, dose -normalized derived exposure parameters will be summarized descriptively by age group 
(≤6 months, > 6 to ≤ 1 2 months, >12 to <  24 months, ≥ 24 months to ≤4 years, >4 to ≤ 8 years, > 8 to <12 years, 
≥12 to < 18 years and ≥18 years) and also presented in box- plots, stratified by subjects taking and not taking 
EIAEDs.   Additionally, dose -normalized derived exposure parameters will be summarized descriptively for 
the following age groups:  1 to 24 months, 2 to ≤ 4 years, >4 to ≤ 8 years, >8 to <12 years, ≥12 to <18 years 
and ≥18 years), and also presented in box -plots, stratified by subjects with EIAED  and non -EIAEDs.   (revised 
per Amendment 02)  
The final PK model wi ll be qualified using visual predictiv e checks and validated using bootstrap analysis.

 Safety Analyses  
Evaluation of safety will be performed on the Safety Analysis Set.  Assessments that will be evaluated include 
AEs, SAEs, clinical laboratory results, vital signs, and 12 -lead ECGs.  Treatment -emergent AEs will be 
summarized by presenting the incidence of TEAEs and the overall inci dence  by age group and EIAED and 
non-EIAED groups .  The incidence of out -of-normal -range laboratory safety tests variables will be 
summarized along with change from baseline in laboratory safety test variables and vital sign measu rements.  
Descriptive summary statistics of the laboratory, vital signs, and ECG parameters will also be evaluated.   
Descriptive summary statistics of changes from baseline in growth (ie, height/length, head circumference, 
weight) will be evaluated.  Thes e data may also be compared with normative scores to assess clinical relevance.  
Changes from baseline for thyroid function and IGF -1 testing will be summarized.  
Other Analyses  
Not applicable . 
Interim Analyses  
An interim analysis  (safety, tolerability, and PK) will be performed as follows:  
• After every 4th  subject in the age group 1 to less than 24 months completes  the Maintenance Period 
where dose -normalized exposure will be compared to that observed in other studies in subjects 
between ≥2 and < 18 years of age for evidence of systematic deviations potentially warranting dose 
adjustment in this age group or for other subjects enrolled in the study.   PK data collected in older age 
cohort (2 to less than 4 years) will also be examined in the interim PK analyses.   (revised per 
Amendment 02)  
• All data from the Pretreatment and Treatment Phases will be analyzed when all subjects have completed the Maintenance Period.  In addition, a final analysis of data from the Pretreatment, Treatment,  and Extension Phases will be analyzed when all subjects have completed the Extension 
Phase.   (revised per Amendment 02)  
An independent data monitoring committee ( DMC) will be constructed to monitor the safety data.  The 
responsibilities, membership, and purpose of the DM C, the timing of the meeting(s), and an outline of the plan 
for review of the safety data will be documented in the DMC Charter.  
Sample Size Rationale  
Similar to Study 232, Study 238 will use population PK modeling to characterize PK in pediatric subjects 1 to 
less than 24  months  and 2 to less than 4 years of age, and compare these data to PK in adolescent  and adult 
subjects .  In a prior study (Study 23 2), data were obtained in 42  subjects ≥ 2 to <12  years  of age , with 
approximate equal numbers enrolled in the age ranges of ≥ 2 to ≤6 and ≥ 7 to <12 years .  (revised per 
Amendment 02)  
Given the narrower age range planned for Study 238 compared with Study 232, and the fact that the PK data from this study will be pooled with the data from subjects  in ≥2 to < 12 years of age , it is proposed that PK  data 
obtained in at least 16 subjects ≥ 1 to <24 months  of age would be adequate to characterize the PK in this age 
group.  The sample size will be increased to at least  24 subjects if dose -normalized (to 8 mg) exposure in the 
Maintenance Period from the first 16 subjects in this study is not com parable to existing data in subjects aged 
≥2 to 18 year s.  (revised per Amendment 02)  
In order to compare the PK of pediatric subject s aged 2 to less than 4 years  of age with  the PK of pediatric 
subject s aged >4 years  of age , a total of 26 subjects with 13 EIAED and 13 non- EIAED subjects will be enrolled  
and pooled across clinical studies  of perampanel with PK assessment . This estimate of the required sample 
size assumes the inter-subject variability of 46.8% (CPMS -E2007 -015-v1), equivalent to a coefficient of 
variation (CV) on the log scale of 0.445, that provides a sufficient number of subjects to target a 95% 
confidence interval within 60% and 140% of the point estimate for the geometric mean clearance of

 5 ETHICS 
5.1 Institutional Review Boards/Independent Ethics Committees  
The protocol, informed consent form ( ICF), and appropriate related documents must be 
reviewed and approved by an Institutional Review Board ( IRB) or Independent Ethics 
Committee (IEC) constituted and functioning in accordance with ICH E6 ( Good Clinical 
Practice [GCP] ), Section  3, and the European Good Clinical Practice Directive 2005/28/EC 
and Clinical Trial Directive 2001/20/EC, and  the United States  (US)  Code of Federal 
Regulations (CRF) , Title 21  CFR Part 56 .  Any protocol amendment or revision to the ICF will 
be resubmitted to the IRB/IEC for review and approval, except for changes involving only 
logistical or administrative aspects of the study (eg , change in Clinical Research Associate 
[CRA( s)], change of telephone number[s]).  Documentation of IRB/IEC compliance with the 
ICH E6 and any local regulations regarding constitution and review conduct will be provided 
to the sponsor. 
A signed letter of study approval from the IRB/IEC chairman must be sent to the principal 
investigator (PI) with a copy to the sponsor before study start and the release of any study drug 
to the site by the sponsor or its designee ( ICH E6, Section  4.4).  If the IRB/IEC decides to 
suspend or terminate the study, the investigator will immediately send the notice of study suspension or termination by the IRB/IEC to the sponsor. 
Study progress is to be reported to IRB/IECs annually ( or as required) by the investigator or 
sponsor, depending on local regulatory obligations.  If the investigator is required to report to 
the IRB/IEC, he/she will forward a copy to the sponsor at the time of each periodic report.  The investigator( s) or the sponsor will submit, depending on local regulations, periodic  reports and 
inform the IRB/IEC of any repor table  adverse events ( AEs) per ICH guidelines and local 
IRB/IEC standards of practice.  Upon completion of the study, the investigator will provide the IRB/IEC with a brief report of the outcome of the study, if required. 
At the end of the study, the sponsor should notify the IRB/IEC and Competent Authority (CA) 
within 90 d ays.  The end of the study will be the date of the last study visit for the last subject 
in the study.  The sponsor should also provide the IRB/IEC with a summary of the study’s 
outcome.  
In the case of early termination/temporary halt of the study, the investigator should notify the IRB/IEC and CA within 15  calendar days, and a detailed written explanation of the reasons for

 7 INTRODUCTION  
Perampanel (E2007) is an orally active, noncompetitive, and highly selective α -amino -
3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4- isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) -type glutamate receptor antagonist 
with potential for therapeutic use in patients with  various neurological diseases.  Perampanel 
is approved in the US for the treatment (including monotherapy) of partial -onset seizures 
(POS) with or without secondarily generalized seizures in patients with epilepsy aged 4 years 
and older, and as adjunctive therapy of primary generalized tonic -clonic seizures (PGTCS) in 
patients with epilepsy aged 12 years and older.  Perampanel is also approved in the EU as an adjunctive treatm ent of POS and PGTCS in patients with epilepsy aged 12 years and older.  
This study aims to provide pharmacokinetics (PK) and safety data of perampanel in pediatric 
subjects from age ≥1 to < 24 months  and from age 2 to less than 4 years.   (revised  per 
Amendment 02) 
Epilepsy is a common neurological problem in ( Hauser, 1992; Hauser, 1994, Bourgeois, 1995).  
Generalized seizures predominate in the first years of life, but by age 5  years, POS are also 
common ( Hauser, 1992).  Despite recent advances in drug treatment, one of ever y 4 patients 
with epilepsy does not achieve long- term seizure freedom  (Northam, 2005) and suffer s from 
intractable seizures, while many others experience significant treatment -related side effects 
(Fountain, 2007).  Selection of an anti -epileptic drug (AED) for the treatment of pediatric 
patients with epilepsy has been particularly difficult because of the lack of clinical studies in 
this popul ation  especially in younger pediatrics ( age <4 years ) (Piña -Garza, 2005 ; Ouellet, 
2001).   (revised per Amendment 02) 
Given the inherent challenges in performing clinical studies in children, extrapolation of efficacy from adult to pediatric subject s (24 months  and above) with partial onset seizures has 
been accepted as an alternative to randomized, double -blind, placebo- controlled Phase 3 
studies in children, as reflected in the September 2019 FDA Guidance “Drugs for Treatment of Partial Onset Seizures:  Full Extrapolation of Efficacy from Adults to Pediatric subject s 
24 months of Age and Older”.  To support extrapolation, adequately designed PK and tolerability study(ies) with sufficient sample size are required to demonstrate similar exposure (blood/plasma levels of active drugs and, as applicable, metabolites) and to evaluate safety profile following drug administration in pediatric subject s aged 24 month s and above.  This 
efficacy extrapolation approach, however, does not apply to subject s under 24 months  of age.  
For this population, w ell-designed clinical trials are required to determine efficacy, safety and 
tolerability, PK, and appropriate dosages ( Northam, 2005).   (revised per Amendment 02) 
7.1 Study Rationale  
European Union legislation on pediatric medicines came into effect in Jan 2007.  This 
legislation defines the obligations for the conduct of clinical trials in pediatric populations to address problems of inadequate dosage information, non- availability of therapeutic advances, 
dose formulations, and routes of administration in pediatric populations. The legislation is expected to stimulate research and result in increased numbers of pediatric clinical trials

 overseen by the new Paediatric Committee (PDCO) within the European Medicines Agency 
(EMA).   
The main direc tive of the PDCO is to assess the content of Paediatric Investigation Plans (PIPs) 
and adopt opinions on them in accordance with Regulation (EC) 1901/2006 as amended.  This 
includes the assessment of applications and assessing data generated in accordance with agreed PIPs and adopting opinions on the quality, safety or efficacy of any medicine for use in the pediatric population (at the request of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) or a CA).  The original PIP for perampanel was approved by PDCO on 19 Mar 2010.  
Study E2007-G000-238 is part of the approved PIP to which Eisai is committed to perform as part of the pediatric program.   
Pediatric study requirements in the United States are legislated under the Pediatric Research Equity Act  (PREA) (21 U.S.C. 355c), which requires that all applications for new active 
ingredients, new indications, new dosage forms, new dosing regimens or new routes of administration contain an assessment of the safety and effectiveness of the product for the claimed indication in pediatric patients unless the requirement is waived, deferred, or 
inapplicable.  As part of the approval for perampanel tablets in the U S under NDA 202834 as 
adjunctive therapy for the treatment of partial -onset seizures with or without secondarily 
generalized seizures in patients with epilepsy aged 12 years and older, the FDA granted a deferral of pediatric studies of perampanel for ages 1 month to less than 12 years.  Study 
E2007-G000- 238 is part of a series of deferred pediatric stud ies that are required postmarketing 
studies under section 505B(a) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. 
Study E2007-G000-238 has been approved by PDCO; it is required by FDA and will be the 
first study to be conducted in the pediatric population of age ≥1 to < 24 months with 
perampanel .  In this youngest age group, the study will evaluate the PK and will generate 
preliminary safety and efficacy of perampanel following the administration of an oral 
suspension.  Below is a summary of 2 studie s of perampanel that have been initiated in the 
pediatric age group: 
• Study E2007-G000- 235 (Study 235), was the first stand -alone pediatric study for 
perampanel, recruited an adolescent population similar to those examined in the Phase 
3 studies with the same dose ran ge (ie, 2 to 12 mg/day).  The primary objective of this 
study was to evaluate the effect of perampanel on cognition.  In addition to cognition, growth and development will also be evaluated including sexual maturation. Although no such safety issues have b een identified in relation to perampanel to date, Study 235 
has been designed according to the European CHMP guideline (CPMP/EWP/566/98 Rev. 2) on the need for data “to detect the potential effect on learning, intelligence, growth, endocrine function, and puberty”.  The study has been completed.  T he study 
met its primary objective and there was no statistically significant or clinically relevant overall cognitive impairment detected in the study with perampanel compared to placebo. 
• Study E2007-G000- 232 (Study 232), in a pediatric population of ages ≥2 to <12 years  
has completed .  The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the

 pharmacokinetics (PK) of perampanel following oral suspension administration given 
as an adjunctive therapy in pediatric subjects age ≥2 to <12 years with epilepsy.   
Perampanel oral suspension (0.5 mg/mL) will be used in Study 238.  This formulation was used in Study 232.  The bioequivalence between the oral suspension formulation and the tablet 
formulation was evaluated in Study E2007-A001- 048 under fed and fasted conditions.  The 
results of the study in conjunction with steady state PK simulations of the data confirmed that the oral suspension formulation is bioequivalent to the tablet formulation, and can be used 
interchange ably with the tablet formulation.  From a safety point of view, both the oral 
suspension and tablet formulations were well- tolerated  
In support of pediatric development and minimizing the blood volume necessary to complete appropriate PK analyses, fully validated  dried blood spot (DBS) sampling method was used 
for analysis of perampanel concentrations in Study 232.  However, sites in this study encountered sampling challenges with resultant loss of samples.  For this study, a small -volume 
plasma assay requ iring  only 1- mL blood volume per time  point will be used.  (revised per 
Amendment 02) 
Eslicarbazepine ( ESL) is structurally and functionally related to oxcarbazepine  (OXC) 
(Rogawski, 2004)  and was approved for use by the EMA in April 2009.  In vitro, ESL is a 
weak inducer of CYP3A4 and UDP -glucuronyl transferases.  In vivo, ESL showed an inducing 
effect on the metabolism of medicinal products that are mainly eliminated by metabolism 
through CYP3A4 (Zebinix® SmPC ).  Therefore, ESL is being included in this study as a n 
enzyme-inducing AED (ie, EIAED ) to facilitate enrollment of subjects into this subgroup. 
7.2 Dosing Rationale  
A key objective of AED dosing with perampanel in pediatrics is to identify appropriate doses 
such that plasma levels fall within a concentration range associated with the therapeutic effect and acceptable safety previously demonstrated in adults.  Stabilizing plasma drug levels can be more difficult in infants  and toddlers  than in adolescents or adults because of variability in 
absorption and drug metabolism ( Ramsey, 2007).  For example, compared to a dolescents and 
adults , during the first year of life infants have reduced hepatic metabolism that by the end of 
their first year progresses to substantially greater hepatic metabolism , which can  have 
important implications for dosing ( Pellock, 1998).  
Perampanel is almost completely absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and is mostly eliminated in the feces (about 70%) following metabolism primarily via the cytochrome (CYP) P450 3A4 pathway in the l iver.  T he possibility exists that the PK profile of perampanel may 
differ between infants and toddlers  compared with, adolescents and adults, thus requiring 
age-specific dosage regimens.  Study 238 is designed to evaluate the optimal maintenance dose 
and the dosing regimens to achieve plasma concentrations in  infants and toddlers  aged 1 month 
to less than 4 years comparable to those in adolescents and adults.  
The clinical development plan for perampanel included Phase 3 studies (Studies E2007 G00 0-
304, -305 and - 306); in addition to enrollment of adults, these studies included adolescent

 subjects ≥12 to < 18 years  of age .  Treatment with pera mpanel for doses ranging from 4 to 
12 mg/day in these Phase 3 studies was significantly more effective than adjunctive  treatment 
with placebo in improving seizure control in subjects ≥12 years  of age with refractory POS .  
The studies also demonstrated a positive safety and tolerability profile in this population.   
A population PK analysis was completed on data from 74 adolescent ( ≥12 to <18 years  of age ) 
subjects only and from 770 adolescent and adult subjects combined from Studies 304, 305 and 
306.  Perampanel clearance increased in the presence of co -administered carbamazepine 
(CBZ) , OXC, and phenytoin (PHT)  by approximately 3- fold, 2- fold, and 2- fold respectively.  
Perampanel clearance was not affected by baseline seizure frequency, the time during the study, dose administered, race, age, renal or liver conditions (estimated from creatinine clearance or liver function tests respectively) and concomitant AEDs lamotrigine, levetiracetam, topiramate, valproic acid, zonisamide, primidone, clobazam, and phenobarbital.  A small effect of gender and body mass was found but these were not considered clinically important.  Findings from a recent population PK analysis on data from 78 adolescents from 
Study 235 pooled with the data from the 74 adolescents from Studies 304, 305, and 306, were in full agreement with those from the previous analysis. 
A corresponding population PK/pharmacodynamic ( PD) analysis for the relationship between 
exposure and seizure frequency was also completed on data from 105 adolescent subjects only 
and 1109 adolescent and adult subjects combined from St udies 304, 305, and 306.  On the 
natural logarithm scale, a significant decrease in seizure frequency o f 0.000569 for an increase 
of 1 ng/mL in perampanel concentration was found.  There were no differences in response to 
perampanel resulting from gender, race, age, and co- administration of any AE Ds.  An 
additional population PK/PD responder analysis on data from the same 105 adolescent subjects only and from 1109 adolescent and adult subjects combined showed that the proportion of 
responders increases with the concentration of perampanel.  Again, findings from a recent 
population PK/PD analysis on data from 110 adolescents from Study 235 pooled with the data from the 105 adolescents from Studies 304, 305, and 306 were in full agreement with those from the previous analysis. 
Overall, perampanel PK was shown to be similar in adolescents and adults, was not affected 
in clinically important ways by body weight, age, gender, race, body mass (across the range of adolescents and adults), and not affected by co- administration of AEDs other than inducing 
CYP 3A concomitant CBZ , OXC, and PHT .   
A PK analysis of data from Study 232 comparing dose -normalized perampanel concentrations 
in 42 pediatric epilepsy subjects ( aged ≥2 to <12 years) with dose -normalized perampanel 
concentrations from adolescent subjects ( aged ≥12 to <18 years) in Studies 304, 305 and 306 
was conducted.  Of the 42 subjects with wide range of body weights (ie, 12.2 to 90.9 kg) 
analyzed to date, 20 were aged ≥2 to ≤ 6 years and 22 were  aged ≥7 to <12 years.  A total of 28 
subjects were not receiving any of the EIAEDs  (CBX, OXC, or PHT ) and 14 subjects were 
receiving one of these EIAEDs .  As noted above, subjects in Study 232 were administered 
perampanel suspension (0.5 mg/mL) according to a weight based regimen compared to tablet s 
in Studies 304, 305, and 306.  Whole blood perampanel concentration values from Study 232

 analyzed using the DBS technique were converted to plasma concentrations, and for 
comparison purposes both plasma perampanel concentrations.  The results of the analysis 
demonstra ted that perampanel PK was linear as there was no dose or time- dependency to 
apparent oral clearance (CL/F).  The CL/F was not significantly affected by age, body weight, 
gender, race, hepatic function markers ( alanine aminotransferase [ ALT ] or aspartate 
aminotransferase [ AST ]), renal function marker (creatinine clearance) or the use of the oral 
suspension formulation in this population.  The predicted perampanel average steady state plasma concen tration dose normalized to 0.12 mg/kg in (intended to correspond to 8 mg/ 70 kg 
in adults/adolescents) for Study 232 were lower than that at 8 mg dose in adolescents from previous Phase 2 and 3 studies.  Since predicted CL/F was comparable among the 3 categorical groups (age 2 to <7, 7 to <12, and 12 to <18 years) independent of weight, the lower steady state concentration was deemed to be due to the lower total dose (mg/body) administered in these.  The results of the analysis suggested that flat dosing approach will be more appropriate in subjec ts within that age range.   
Considering the ontogenic profile of CYP3A enzyme in pediatrics , especially between 1  to less 
than 24 months  old, and due to the unknown safety profile in this population, a lower starting 
dose of 0.5 mg/day was selected, with t itrations to a dose of 12 mg/day (non- EIAED  subjects) 
or 16 mg ( EIAED  subjects). To date, sparse PK data is available from 3 pediatric subjects 
between age of 4.5 months to 20 months  receiving perampanel as part of a Named Patient IND.  
These subjects were dosed with perampanel up to 8 mg/day at steady state. The plasma 
concentration data in the 3 individuals although close to upper end of the range, were still within the 2 -fold relative to the exposures observed in 2 to <12 year old subjects. Based on 
these findings, the likelihood of starting dose of 0.5 mg achieving unexpectedly high plasma 
exposures in the proposed age population is considered to be low. Furthermore, noting the wide variability in hepatic metabolism via CYP3A in pediatric  subjects less t han 24 months  of 
age, the risk of unexpected plasma exposures in number of pediatric subjects is further 
minimized by planned interim PK analysis in the first 4 subjects completing the PK portion of Study 238.  These data (dose -normalized to 8 mg) will be compared with data from  and 
adolescents (≥2 to <18 years  of age ) from previous studies for evidence of systematic 
deviations potentially warranting dose adjustment in this age group.

 9 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
9.1 Overall Study Design and Plan  
This will be a multicenter, open -label study with an E xtension P hase that will enroll 16 to 
24 pediatric subjects 1 to less than 24 months  of age  and at least to a maximum of 26  pediatric 
subjects from 2 to less than 4 years of age with epilepsy.  (revised per Amendment 02) 
All subjects must be taking 1 to a  maximum of 4 AEDs to participate in the study.  For at least 
6 but not more  than 8 of the subjects  in the age group of 1 to less than 24 months and for 
13 subjects in the age group of 2 to less than 4 years  (across studies) , only 1 EIAED  (ie, CBZ, 
OXC, PHT , or ESL) out of the maximum of 4 AEDs will be allowed.  These subjects will be 
referred to as EIAED subjects.  The remaining subjects cannot be taking any EIAEDs  and will 
be referred to as non -EIAED subjects.   (revised per Amendment 02) 
For the age group of 1 to less than 24 months , the Sponsor will ensure a reasonable 
representation of subject age (ie, at least  6 subjects in the age range ≥1 to ≤6 months, at least 
5 subjects in the age range > 6 to ≤12 months , and at least 5 subjects in the age range > 12 to 
<24 months).  (revised  per Amendment 02)  
For the age group of 2 to less than 4 years , the required number of subjects (total of 26) can be 
pooled across multiple studies for PK and safety assessments in pediatric subjects of 2 to less 
than 4 years of age. Therefore, the target  number of subjects to be enrolled in this age group in 
this study ranges from a minimum of 1 to a maximum of 26  subjects .  Enrollment of subjects 
aged 2 to less than 4 years into this study may be stopped upon notification of sponsor when 
the total number has been reached across clinical studies, or when enrollment in the 1 to less than 24 months  age group in this study has completed (ie, the original purpose of this study 
has been met).  (revised per Amendment 02) 
This study will consist of 3 phases:  Pretreatment and Treatment (Core Study), and Extension.  
The Pretreatment Phase will last up to 2  weeks, during which subjects will be assessed for their 
eligibility to participate in the study.  The Treatment Phase will consist of 3 periods:  Titration 
(12-16 weeks), Maintenance (4  weeks), and Follow -up (4 weeks; only for those subjects who 
complete the Maintenance Period but do not continue into the Extension Phase).  The Extension Phase will consist of 2 periods:   Maintenance ( 32-36 weeks) and Follow-up 
(4 weeks) .  (revised per Amendment 02)
 
The end of the study will be the date of the last study visit for the last subject. 
The maximum total duration of treatm ent for each subject will be 52  weeks and the maximum 
total duration of the study for each subje ct will be 58  weeks (2 weeks Pretreatment+52 weeks 
of treatment+ 4 week Follow-up).  (revised per Amendment 02) 
Subjects who complete the Extension Phase and who, in the opinion of the investigator, will 
likely continue to demonstrate a positive benefit -to-risk ratio from treatment with perampanel 
may be enrolled into an extended access program (EAP) for perampanel  if EAP is implemented 
for this  age group in the country where the subject resides.   (revised per Amendment 02)

Perampanel dose should not be further up- titrated beyond 6 mg/day (non -EIAED subjects) or 
8 mg/day ( EIAED  subjects) unless there is a medical need (for example, a subject who 
tolerated perampanel well but have not reached optimal seizure control).  Before  dose up -
titrations beyond 6 mg/day (non- EIAED subjects) or 8 mg/day (EIAED subjects) and 
whenever practically feasible, it is recommended to take a blood sample for the measurement 
of plasma perampanel level as a precautionary measure.  The date and time of the last perampanel dose administration, as well as the date and time of PK blood draw, for these 
unscheduled PK sample collection will be recorded.  Up -titrations of perampanel dose within 
the range of 0.5 to 6 mg/day will be at 1- week intervals ; and at doses greater than 6  mg/day 
will be at 2 -week intervals  (see Study Treatment(s) section).  Dose titrations must  not exceed 
12 mg/day (non- EIAED subjects) or 16 mg/day ( EIAED  subjects); see Study Treatment(s) 
section).  The decision to up- titrate perampanel dose will be at the investigator’s discretion, 
based on individual subject’s clinical response and/or tolerability to achieve optimal dose for a given subject.  Once the optimal dose has been achieved, the subject’s dose will be maintained stable for the remaining Titration Period or at least 2 weeks before ent ering the 
Maintenance Period.  (revised per Amendment 02). 
9.1.2.2 Maintenance Period 
During the Maintenance Period, subjects will continue taking perampanel oral suspension at the dose level they achieved at the end of the Titration Period.  
9.1.2.3 Follow -Up Period 
Subjects who do not continue into the Extension Phase after completing the Maintenance Period , or those who discontinue early from the study will be required to complete the 
Follow-up Period after their last dose in the Treatment Phase.  During this period , subjects will 
not receive study drug.   Subjects who switch to commercially available perampanel or who 
enter into EAP upon completion of study treatment would not need to under Follow -up V isit; 
however, sites will conduct a telephone contact 28 (+6) days  after the last dose of study drug 
to follow adverse events ( AEs) and report any serious adverse events ( SAEs ) that occur within 
28 days of the last study drug administration.  (revised per Amendment 02) 
9.1.3 Extension Phase  
Subjects who have completed the last  visit of the Core Study Maintenance Period will be 
eligible to participate in the Extension Phase of this study.  For these subjects, upon completion 
of the last visit of the Maintenance Period they will be considered as participating in the  
Extension Pha se.

9.2 Discussion of Study Design, Including Choice of Control Groups  
This current study (E2007-G000- 238) is part of the continuing development of perampanel in 
pediatric subjects. The purpose of the current study is to fulfill both the European and US 
regulatory requirements for the development of AEDs  in pediatric age grou ps.   
The primary objective of the study is to assess PK in order to determine appropriate dosing regimens of perampanel in pediatric subject s younger than 24 months of age.  Accordingly, 
this study is designed as open- label, single -arm, uncontrolled study with no placebo or 
active-control treatment groups.  (revised per Amendment 02) 
Considering the ontogenic development of CYP3A (the enzyme responsible for perampanel 
metabolism) during the first 2 4 months of life, perampanel PK may be affected as the levels of 
CYP3A is changing.  To better characterize perampanel PK over the time course of CYP3 A 
maturation, t his study will seek to ensure adequate age representation among subjects (ie, at 
least 6 subjects a re in the age range 1 to ≤6 months, at least 5 subjects are in the age range >6 
to ≤12 months, and at least 5 subjects are in the age range >12 to <24 months).  Additionally, 
due to the limited PK data collected for perampanel in the age group of 2 to <4 years, this study is amended to expand enrollment to include subjects aged 2 to less than 4 years.   (revised per 
Amendment 02) 
In this study, all subjects will be receiving perampanel as an adjunctive treatment.  As with 
dosing regimens studied in Phase 3 s tudies in adolescents and adults, gradual increase in dose 
(dose titrations) to reach therapeutic dose levels will be employed.  Clinical response and tolerability will be used as the criteria to make decision whether to escalate dose at each titration ste p and to define the optimal dose for individual subject.  The dose titration scheme 
and maximum doses (12 mg/kg [non- EIAED subjects] and 16 mg/kg [EIAED subjects]) have 
been evaluated in a Phase 3 study (E2007-G000- 311) in 180 pediatric subject s (4 to <12 years) 
with refractory POS with or without secondarily generalized seizures or with PGTCS, and was found to be generally safe and well tolerated.  (revised per Amendment 02) 
Given the vulnerability associated with the young age of this study population and the lack of 
safety and PK information in this young age group, precautionary safety measures will be 
employed:  (1) Slightly longer titration intervals (ie, 1 -week intervals up to 6 mg/day and then 
2-week intervals from 6 mg/day to maximum dose of 12 mg/d ay [non- EIAED subjects] or 
16 mg/day [EIAED subjects]), compared to those in the adolescent/adult studies; (2) a 4- fold 
lower starting dose (0.5 mg/day instead of labeled 2 mg/day) will be employed as a 
precautionary safety measure, and (3) periodic interim PK analysis to examine the 
appropriateness of the target doses and dose range employed in this study.  (revised per 
Amendment 02)

9.3.3 Removal of Subjects From Therapy or Assessment  
The investigator may withdraw the subject from the study at any time for safety or administrative reasons.  The subject may stop study drug or withdraw from the study at any time for any reaso n. 
In the event a subject discontinues study drug, an Early Discontinuation Visit will be 
performed.  The subject should also return 4 weeks (± 6 days) after the last dose of study drug 
to complete the Follow -up Visit procedures.  The Subject Disposition case report f orm ( CRF) 
will be completed indicating the primary reason for discontinuation and all other reasons contributing to the subject’s discontinuation from treatment.   In addition, the date of last dose 
of study drug will be recorded on the Study Drug Dosing CRF.  
9.4 Treatment (s)

 EIAED  subjects) or 8 mg/day ( EIAED  subjects) .  Depending on individual subject’s 
clinical response and tolerability, non -EIAED subjects could still have the perampanel d ose 
up-titrated to 6 mg/day.  Perampanel dose should not be further up -titrated beyond 6 
mg/day (non- EIAED subjects) or 8 mg/day (EIAED subjects) unless there is a medical 
need (for example, a subject who tolerated perampanel well but have not reached optimal 
seizure control ).  Before dose up- titrations beyond 6 mg/day (non- EIAED subjects) or 8 
mg/day (EIAED subjects) and w henever practically feasible,  it is recommended to take a 
blood sample for the measurement of plasma perampanel level as a precautio nary measure.  
The date and time of the last perampanel dose administration, as well as the date and time 
of PK blood draw, for these unscheduled PK sample collection will be recorded.  Up-titrations of perampanel dose within the range of 0.5 to 6 mg/day w ill be at 1 -week 
interva ls; and at doses greater than 6 mg/day will be at 2 -week intervals (see Study 
Treatment(s) section) .  Dose titrations must  not exceed 12 mg/day (non- EIAED subjects) 
or 16 mg/day (EIAED subjects).  The decision to up- titrate perampanel dose will be at the 
investigator’s discretion, based on individual subject’s clinical response and/or tolerability to achieve optimal dose for a given subject.  Once the optimal dose has been achieved, the subject’s dose will be maintained stable for th e remaining Titration Period or at least 2 
weeks before entering the Maintenance Period  (revised per Amendment 02) 
According to the investigator’s clinical judgment subjects experiencing intolerability at any dose may remain at the same dose or have their dose decreased one dose level down to the previously tolerated dose.  If the subject continues to present significant intolerable AEs at the decreased dose and the investigator deems it is necessary, the dose can be decreased further to the next dose level  down.  Dose decreases can be done via telephone.  Subjects 
whose dose has been decreased can have their dose increased again if tolerability improves.  This must be  done at the next clinic visit after the investigator has deemed it is appropriate 
in view of the resolution of the AE(s).  Multiple dose adjustments will be allowed during the Titration Period.  Every effort should be made to have subjects achieve their optimal dose, not to exceed a maximum dose of 12 mg/day (non- EIAED  subjects) or 16 mg/day 
(EIAED subjects)  during the Titration Period.  (revised per Amendment 02) 
• Maintenance Period (4 weeks):  During this period, subjects will continue taking 
perampanel oral suspension at the dose level they achieved at the end of the Titration Period. 
Adjustment of the dose level during the Maintenance Period should be discouraged; 
however, according to the investigator’s clinical judgment, subjects experiencing intolerable AE(s) will be allowed to have their dose decreased to the previously tolerated dose.  During the Maintenance Period, subjects whose dose has been decreased cannot have their dose increased again.  A subject may not decrease their dose more than once during Maintenance Period unless there is a significant medical reason and with approv al from the 
Medical Monitor.  
During the entire Titration and Maintenance Periods, all dose adjustments will be done via 1 dose level up or down (Table 1  and Table 2 ).  Subjects who do not tolerate a dose of 
0.50 mg/day will be discontinued from the study.  The maximum total daily dose a subject 
will be allowed is 12 mg (non- EIAED  subjects) or 16 mg ( EIAED  subjects) .

 Dosing Modifications 
After every 4th subject in the age group 1 to less than 24 months completes the 
Maintenance Period , an interim analysis (safety, tolerability, and PK) will be conducted 
and reviewed by the Eisai study team to decide if dosing modifications are required for 
additional subjects who enroll in the study.  If the exposure of the subjects is significantly 
different from that observed in subjects ages ≥2 to <12 years from  other clinical studies or 
that are predicted from PK modeling and simulation, or if non- linear PK is observed, the 
sample size will be increased to at least 24 subjects with evaluable PK data and the target 
dose or dosing regimen of those subjects may be modified via a protocol amendment , 
depending on the PK of the previous subjects.  PK data collected in older age cohort (2 to 
less than 4 years) will also be examined in the interim PK analyses.  (revised per Amendment 02) 
• Follow- Up Period (4 weeks):  Subjects will not receive study drug during this period.   
Subjects who do not continue into the Extension Phase after completing the Maintenance Period, or those who discontinue early from the study will be required to complete the 
Follow-up Period after their last dose in the Treatment Phase.  Subjects who switch to commercially available perampanel or who enter into EAP upon completion of study treatment need not to under go Follow -up V isit; howeve r, sites will conduct a telephone 
contact 28 (+6) days after the last dose of study drug to follow AEs and report any SAEs that occur within 28 days of the last study drug administration. (revised per Amendment  02)

Extension Phase  
Details on treatments administered during the Extension Phase are provided in  Appendix 3. 
Other Dosing Considerations  
Down -titration of perampanel upon early discontinuation or completion of the study is not 
necessary, because the plasma half -life of perampanel is between ~25 (in the presence of 
EIAED) to 105 (in the absence of EIAED)  hours.  As such, plasma concentrations decrease 
gradually following stopping perampanel.  If, in the clinical judgment of the investigator, down- titration of perampanel is still deemed necessary, the investigator must discuss the 
down- titration before the early discontinuation with the Medical Monitor.  
9.4.2 Identity of Investigational Product  
Perampanel oral suspension will consist of the active ingredient, perampanel, and assorted excipients (all of wh ich are considered appropriate for use in a pediatric population) suspended 
in a water -based medium.  The resulting suspension is opaque and practically white.  The 
formulation of perampanel 0.5 mg/mL oral suspension will be pr ovided by Eisai according to 
current Good Manufacturing Practices. 
Perampanel is a Schedule III Controlled Drug Substance in the United States.  
Perampanel oral suspension will be provided by Eisai to an Eisai -approved vendor in 400- mL 
polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottles containin g 340 mL of oral suspension.  The approved 
vendor will label the bottles , place the bottles, suitably sized dosing devices (ie, oral syringes ), 
and appropriately sized bottle adapters for accurate aliquotting (ie, PiBA s) into a tamper -
evident sealed carton , and ship them to the study sites. 
During the Core Study visits, parents /guardians will be provided with a bottle or bottl es of 
suspension that can be redispensed or replaced at the next visit.   Each bottle provided will be 
in a tamper -evident sealed cart on that will also  contain oral syringes and PiBAs.   Detailed 
instructions on increments in dosage during the Titration Period will be provided to the 
subjects/guardians by the site investigator.

 was conducted.  Of the 42 subjects with a wide range of body weights (i e, 12.2 to 90.9 kg) 
analyzed to date, 20 were aged ≥2 to ≤ 7 years and 22 were aged ≥7 to <12 years.  A total of 
28 subjects were not receiving any of the EIAEDs  (ie, CBX, OXC, or PHT) and 14  subjects 
were receiving one of these EI AEDs .  As noted above, subjects in Study 232 were administered 
perampanel oral suspension (0.5 mg/mL) according to a weight -based regimen compared to 
tablets in Studies 304, 305, and 306.  Whole blood perampanel concentration values from 
Study 232 analyzed using the DBS technique were converted to plasma concentrations, and 
for comparison purposes both plasma perampanel concentrations.  The results of the analysis 
demonstrated that perampanel PK was linear as there was no dose or time- dependency to CL/F .  
The CL/F was not significantly affected by age, body weight, gender, race, hepatic function markers (ALT or AST), renal function marker (creatinine clearance) or the use of the oral 
suspension formulation in this population.  The predicted perampanel average steady state 
plasma concen tration dose normalized to 0.12 mg/kg in pediatrics (intended to correspond to 
8 mg/70 kg in adults/adolescents) for Study 232 were lower than that at 8- mg dose in 
adolescents from previous Phase 2 and 3 studies.   Since predicted CL/F was comparable among 
the 3 categorical groups (age 2 to <7, 7 to <12, and 12 to <18 years) independent of weight, the lower steady state concentration was deemed to be due t o the lower total dose (mg/body) 
administered in pediatric subjects.   The results of the analysis suggested that  a flat dosing 
approach will be more appropriate in subjects within that age range.    
Considering the ontogenic profile with CYP3A enzyme in pediatrics , especially between 1 to 
less than 24 months  of age, and due to the unknown safety profile in this population, a lower 
starting dose of 0.5  mg/day was selected for this study, with titrations to a maximum dose of 
12 mg/day (non- EIAED  subjects) or 16 mg/day ( EIAED  subjects).   To date, sparse PK data is 
available from 3 pediatric subjects between age of 4.5 months to 20 months receiving perampanel through a Named Patient IND.  These subjects were dosed perampanel up to 
8 mg/day at steady state.  The plasma concentration data in the 3 individuals although close to 
upper end of the range, were still within the 2- fold relative to the exposures observed in 2 to 
<12 year old subjects . Based on these findings, the likelihood of starting dose of 0.5 mg 
achieving unexpectedly high plasma exposures in the proposed age population is considered 
to be low. 
Furthermore, noting the wide variability in hepatic metabolism via CYP3A in pediatric  
subjects less than 2 4 months of age, the risk of unexpected plasma exposures in number of 
pediatric subjects is further minimized by planned  interim analysis (safety, tolerability, and 
PK) after every 4 th subject complet es the Maintenance Period .  Dose -normalized exposures 
will be compared to that observed in other  studie s in subjects between ≥2 and < 18 years of age 
for evidence of systematic deviations potentially warranting dose adjustment in this age group  
or for other subjects enrolled in the study.   Preliminary PK analysis was performed based on data obtained from 7 subjects (>6 to 
<24 months of age; 6 subjects without concomitant EIAED and 1 subject on concomitant EIAED) in this study and pooled with existing data from 2336 subjects (aged 2 to 77 years).  
Preliminary PK findings suggest that oral clearance in subjects aged less than 24 months  
without concomitant EIAED appears to be approximately 40% of that in subjects age d

 ≥2 years.  It is predicted that a daily dose of 6 mg or 8 mg in subjects aged less than 24 months  
without or with concomitant EIAED, respectively, will result in comparable exposure to that 
in subjects aged >2 years receiving a daily dose of 12 mg (non-E IAED subjects)  or 16 mg 
(EIAED  subjects) , respectively.  However, European Medicines Agency/Paediatric Committee 
(EMA/PDCO) recommended that perampanel dose should be titrated up to a target dose of 4 
mg/day for non- EIAED subjects (EMEA -000467- PIP01 -08-M13), which could be f urther 
titrated up to 6 mg/day depending on individual subject’s clinical response and tolerability.  Therefore, the target dose in this study is revised to 4 mg/day (non- EIAED subjects) and 
8 mg/day ( EIAED  subjects) in subjects less than 2 4 months of age, while the maximum dose 
allowed remains as 12  mg/day and 16 mg/day for non -EIAED and EIAED subjects, 
respectively .  Perampanel dosage should not be further up- titrated, unless there is a medical 
need (for example, a subject who tolerated  perampanel well but have not reached optimal 
seizure control).  At any time in the study, perampanel dose must not to exceed 12  mg/day (non- EIAED subjects) or 16  mg/day (EIAED subjects).  (revised per Amendment 02) 
In subjects 2 to <4 years of age, there were very limited PK data (n=4) to allow adequate evaluation of effect of age on perampanel PK.  Therefore, the same target dose and dose titration approach will be followed for non- EIAED and EIAED subjects aged 2 to less than 
4 year s as described above for 1  to less than 2 4 month s subjects.   (revised per Amendment 02)  
9.4.5 Selection and Timing of Dose for Each Subject  
Subjects will be instructed to take the study drug, by mouth, and before bedtime in the evening .  
9.4.6 Blindin g 
This is an open -label, single-arm study.  There is no blinding. 
9.4.7 Prior and Concomitant Therapy  
Any medication (including over the counter medications, or herbals) or therapy administered (including AEDs) during the course of the study (starting at the date of informed consent and 
those taken within 4 weeks of Visit 1) will be recorded on the  Prior and Concomitant Therapy 
CRF  and/or Nonpharmacologic Therapy/Procedure CRF . The investigator will record any AE 
on the Adverse Events CRF  for which the concomi tant medic ation/therapy was administered.  
Subjects will be taking 1 to a maximum of 4 marketed AEDs (see inclusion criteria 6 and 7 
and exclusion criteria 6 through 8 for further details).  C hanges of baseline AEDs (addition, 
deletion, or adjustment in dose) will not be allowed during 5 half- lives or  during the 2 weeks, 
whichever is longer, before Vis it 1.  During the Core study, dose adjustments will be allowed 
only for non- EIAEDs.  Dose adjustments of EIAEDs, and addition/deletion of any concomitant 
AEDs are not allowed during the Core study.  Use of CBD products is allowed and is counted 
as 1 of the 4 maximum allowed concomitant AEDs.  CBD dose and product must have 
remained stable for at least 2 weeks before Visit 1 and is to remain the same throughout t he 
course of the Core Study.  (revised per Amendment 02)

Documentation of the physical examination will be included in the source documentation at 
the site.  Significant findings at the Screening Visit will be recorded on the Medical History and Current Medical Conditions CRF.  Changes from screening physical examination findings that meet the definition of an AE will be recorded on the Adverse Events CRF. 
EPILEPSY MEDICAL HISTORY  
In addition to standard medical history, epilepsy medical history will be documented for each subject. 
9.5.1.3 Efficacy Asses sments  
SEIZURE COUNTS  
Efficacy will be assessed by seizure counts and types as reco rded on a study specific seizure 
diary .  Diaries will be dispensed to all subjects at each visit as described in  Table 4 and  Table 
5.  The diary is to be completed daily, by the parent/guardian.  All seizures will be recorded.  At each visit the parent/guardian will be instructed by the site personnel as to how to complete the diary and reminded that they must return the diary at their next scheduled clinic visit and at the Early Discontinuation and Follow- up Visits (if applicable).  To ensure correct 
seizure classification, the p hysician investigator should review the diary  with the 
parent/guardian at all visits. Parents/ guardians must be counseled if diary compliance is not 
satisfactory (ie , missed three or more consecutive daily diary entries).  
CLINICAL GLOBAL IMPRESSION OF CHANGE  
The CGI will be used to evaluate perceived  seizure frequency and severity, the occurrence of 
AEs, and overall functional status of the subject.  The evaluations of CGIS and CGI C both use 
a 7-point scale. For the CGI -S, 1 = normal, not at all ill and 7 = extremely ill, and for the 
CGI-C, 1 = very much improved and 7 = very much worse. 
9.5.1.4 Pharmacokinetic, Pharmacodynamic, Pharmacogenomic , and Other Biomarker  
Assessments 
PHARMACOKINETIC ASSESSMENTS  
Blood samples (1.0 mL) for plasma will be collected from all subjects at pre -specified visits 
for the determination of perampanel concentrations, as detailed in Table 4. 
For subjects aged 1 to less than 24 months:  Dosing should occur  once daily  before bedtime in 
the evening (revised per Amendment 02) .  On the day of the PK sampling, subjects will have 
to attend the clinic any time during the day to provide blood sampling for PK analysis and to 
enable close monitoring of the subjects for safety and tolerability.  One blood sample ( 1.0 mL) 
for the determination of perampanel plasma concentrations will be collected during the 
specified visits.  The resulting plasma sample will be aliquoted into 2 M icrotainer tubes.  
Plasma samples will be a nalyzed u sing a validated small -volume plasma assay method. The

 date and time of perampanel dosing for 3 days before  a PK visit and time of blood PK sampling 
will be recorded. 
For subjects aged 2 to less than 4 years, dosing should occur once daily before bedtime in the 
evening, including the evening before the PK visit during Titration Period (Visit 5 for 
non-EIAED  subjects, or Visit 6 for EIAED subjects).  The dosing date and time of the last 3 
doses before T itiration Period PK visit will be recorded.  Note:  For P K visits during 
Maintenance Period (ie, Visits 7 and 8 for non- EIAED subjects, or Visits 8 and 9 for EIAED 
subjects), as 2 PK samples (1 predose and 1 early postdose [within 1 to 5 hours after dosing]) are to be collected, the following steps are to be fol lowed  (revised per Amendment 02): 
• Study drug administration in the evening immediately before the PK visits during Maintenance Period will be withheld.  All other AEDs should be administered per t he 
subject’s usual AED regimen.   
• During each of the Maintenance Period PK visits, collect predose PK sample.  Then administer study drug on site, followed by early postdose PK sample collection (within 1 to 5 hours after dose administration).  
• Bedtime dosing will resume beginning in the evening of the Maintenance Period PK visits.  
• The dosing date and time of the study drug dose administered on- site during each 
Maintenance Period PK visit, as well as the last 2 doses before will be recorded.   
(revised per Amendment 02) 
A population PK approa ch will be used to characterize the PK of perampanel.  
An approximation of the total blood volume that will be drawn from each subject during the study is presented in Appendix 2. 
For all PK samples, including the unscheduled PK samples collected, if any, before dose 
up-titrations beyond 6 mg/day (non -EIAED subjects) or 8 mg/day (EIAED subjects), plasm a 
concentrations of perampanel will be quantified by a validated  liquid chromatography-tandem 
mass spectrometry (LC -MS/MS ) analytical method in sodium heparinized human plasma 
samples.  (revised per Amendment 02) 
Blood also will be drawn where possible at the first report of a serious adverse event (SAE) or 
severe unexpected AE and at its resolution.  
A detailed description of collection, handling, and shipping procedures of PK samples will be provided in the Laboratory Manual to be provided to the sites.

 9.5.1.5 Safety Assessments  
Safety will be assessed by monitoring and recording of all AEs and SAEs, clinical labs (ie, 
hematology and blood chemistry), vital signs, ECGs, medical history, and physical and neurological examinations.   
Growth will be assessed for this age population by measurement of height, weight, head 
circumference, thyroid function and insulin -like growth factor -1 (IGF -1) testing .   
Details of the timing of all safety assessments are presented in  Table 4.  
Adverse Events a nd Events Associated With Special Situations  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject 
administered an investigational product.  An AE does not necessarily have a causal relationship 
with the medicinal product.  For this study, the study drug is perampanel ( E2007).  
The criteria for identifying AEs in this study are:  
• Any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), 
symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of an investigational product, whether or not considered related to the investigational product (Note:  Every sign or symptom should not be listed as a separa te AE if the applicable disease [diagnosis] is 
being reported as an AE) 
• Any new disease or exacerbation of an existing disease  
• Any deterioration in nonprotocol -required measurements of a laboratory value or other 
clinical test (eg , ECG or x -ray) that resul ts in symptoms, a change in treatment, or 
discontinuation of study drug 
• Recurrence of an intermittent medical condition (eg , headache) not present pretreatment 
(Baseline)  
• An abnormal laboratory test result should be considered an AE if the identified laboratory abnormality leads to any type of intervention, withdrawal of study drug, or withholding 
of study drug, whether prescribed in the protocol or not  
All AEs observed during the study will be reported on the CRF.  All AEs, regardless of relationship to study drug or procedure, should be collected beginning from the time the subject signs the study ICF through the last visit and for 28  days following study drug discontinuation.   
Subjects who fail s creening primarily due to AE(s) must have the AE(s) leading to screen 
failure reported on the Screening Disposition CRF.  SAEs will be collected for 28 days after 
the last dose. 
Abnormal laboratory values should not be listed as separate AEs if they are considered to be 
part of the clinical syndrome that is being r eported as an AE.  It is the responsibility of the 
investigator to review all laboratory findings in all subjects and determine if they constitute an AE.  Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether an isolated

Eisai  
FINAL :  v6.0, 09 Apr 2020 
 Confidential  Page 52 of 93  
 laboratory abnormality should be classified as an AE.  Any laboratory abnormality considered 
to constitute an AE should be reported on the Adverse Event CRF.  
Abnormal ECG QTc  results, if not otherwise considered part of a clinical symptom that is 
being reported as an AE, should be considered an AE if the QTc interval is more than 450  msec 
and there is an increase of more than 60 msec from baseline.  Any ECG abnormality that th e 
investigator considers as an AE should be reported as such. All AEs must be followed for 28 days a fter the subject’s last dose, or until resolution, 
whichever comes first.  All SAEs must be followed to resolution or, if resolution is unlikely, 
to stabilization.  
Every effort must be made by the investigator to categorize each AE according to its 
severity and its relationship to the study treatment.  
ASSESSING SEVERITY OF ADVERSE EVENTS  
AEs will be graded on a 3- point scale ( mild, moderate, severe) and reported in the detail 
indicated on the CRF.  The definitions are as follows: 
Mild  Discomfort noticed, but no disruption of normal daily activity 
Moderate  Discomfort sufficient to reduce or affect normal daily activity  
Severe   Incapacitating, with inability to work or to perform normal daily activity  
The criteria for assessing severity are different than those used for seriousness (see  
Section  9.5.1.5 for the definition of an SAE). 
ASSESSING RELATIONSHIP TO STUDY TREATMENT  
Items to be considered when assessing the relationship of an AE to the study treatment are: 
• Temporal relationship of the onset of the event to the initiation of the study treatment 
• The course of the event, especially the effect of discontinuation of study treatment or 
reintroduction of study treatment, as applicable  
• Whether the event is known to be associated with the study treatment or with other similar 
treatments  
• The presence of ri sk factors in the study subject known to increase the occurrence of the 
event  
• The presence of nonstudy, treatment -related factors that are known to be associated with 
the occurrence of the event

 The relationship of each AE to th e study drug will be recorded on the CRF in response to the 
following question: 
Is there a reasonable possibility that the study drug caused the AE? Yes (related)  A causal relationship between the study drug and the AE is a reasonable 
possibility. 
No (not related)  A causal relationship between the study drug and the AE is not a reasonable possibility. 
Serious Adverse Events and Events Associated With Special Situations 
A serious adverse event (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: 
• Results in death  
• Is life -threatening (ie, the subject was at immediate risk of death from the AE  as it occurred; 
this does not include an event that, had it occurred in a more severe form or was allowed 
to continue, might have caused death) 
• Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect (in the child of a subject who was exposed to the study 
drug) 
Other important medical even ts that may not be immediately life -threatening or result in death 
or hospitalization but, when based on appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize the subject or may require intervention to prevent one of the outcomes in the definition of SAE listed abo ve should also be considered SAEs.  Medical and scientific judgment should be 
exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting is appropriate in such situations.  
In addition to the above, events associated with special situations include AEs associated w ith 
study drug overdose, misuse, abuse, or medication error.  These events associated with special 
situations are to be captured using the SAE procedures but are to be considered as SAEs only 
if they meet one of the above criteria.  All AEs associated with  special situations are to be 
reported on the CRF whether or not they meet the criteria for SAEs.   
All SAEs must be followed to resolution or, if resolution is unlikely to stabilization. 
The following hospitalizations are not considered to be SAEs because  there is no “adverse 
event” (ie, there is no untoward medical occurrence) associated with the hospitalization:  
• Hospitalizations for respite care  
• Planned hospitalizations required by the protocol 
• Hospitalization planned before informed consent ( where the condition requiring the 
hospitalization has not changed after  study drug administration)

 • Hospitalization for administration of study drug or insertion of access for administration of 
study drug 
• Hospitalization for routine maintenance of a device (eg , batte ry replacement) that was in 
place before study entry 
If possible, a blood sample for the measurement of study drug plasma concentration should be 
drawn at the first report of an SAE or a severe unexpected AE and at its resolution.  
LABORATORY MEASUREMENTS  
Blood col lections for c linical laboratory testing , including hematology, and chemistry, are 
summarized in  Table 3 .  Subjects should be in a supine position during blood collection.  In 
addition, blood samples for the  determination of thyroid function (thyroid stimulating hormone 
[TSH], free triiodothyronine [fT3], free thyroxine [fT4]), and IGF -1 levels will be collected

Clinical laboratory tests during the study will be performed by a central laboratory.  A ll clinical 
laboratory tests are to be performed at the central laboratory.  At S creening/ Baseline (Visit 1), 
use of local l aboratory test results (hematology, clinical  chemistry, thyroid function and IGF -1 
test), if obtained within 4 weeks before Visit 1, may be allowed in lieu of blood draw for central laboratory analyses, provided that the subject’s local laboratory tests were performed at a Clinical Laboratory Improv ement Amendments (CLIA)- certified laboratory .  In these cases,

 to enable safety evaluation (eg, to assess whether there are treatment -emergent shifts in 
laboratory values from baseline), all post -baseline labs must be conducted at the same local 
laboratory  using same assays as those used at Screening/ Baseline.  In other cases where 
unscheduled laboratory samples need to be taken and immediately analyzed to address a safety 
concern, blood samples will be split (or 2 samples drawn) to allow for a local labora tory 
analysis in addition to the central laboratory.  Laboratory certification , as well as normal assay 
range for each of local laboratory tests run, will be collected as available and will be included 
in the clinical study report for this protocol.  (revi sed per Amendment 02)  
For laboratory abnormalities meeting the criteria of SAEs (see Section  9.5.1.5), the site must 
fax or email the SAE report including the laboratory report ( as regionally required) to the 
sponsor using the SAE form (see Section  9.5.4.1 ). 
VITAL SIGNS WEIGHT , HEIGHT , AND HEAD CIRCUMFERENCE MEASUREMENTS  
Vital sign measurements (ie , systolic and diastolic blood pressure [BP] [mmHg], pulse [beats 
per minute], respiratory rate [per minute], body temperature [in centigrade]), and growth parameters including measurement of height, weight ( kg), head circumference, will be 
obtained at the visits designated i n the Schedule of Procedures/Assessments ( Table 4).  Blood 
pressure and pulse will be measured after the subject has been sitting  or supine, for 5 minutes.  
All BP measurements should be performed on the same arm, preferably by the same person.  
PHYSICAL EXAMINATIONS  
Physical examinations will be performed as designated i n the Schedule of 
Procedures/Assessments (Table 4 ).  Documentation of the physical examination will be 
included in the source documentation at the site.  Only changes from screening physical examination findings that meet the definition of an AE will be recorded on the Adverse Events 
CRF.  
ELECTROCARDIOGRAMS  
Electrocardiograms will be obtained as designated i n the Schedule of Procedures/Assessments 
(Table 4 ).   
ECGs should preferably be recorded prior to blood draws when both are scheduled at the same visit.  However, if for any reason blood draws occur before ECG recording, then the ECG must be recorded at a minimum of 30 minutes after the blood draw.  The subject should be relaxed and must be in a supine position at least 5 minutes prior to recording an ECG.  The ECG will be reviewed by the investigator (paper or electronic tracing) and will be available for comparison with subsequent ECGs by the investigator.   
If the subject has a normal ECG baseline reading, but during any visit thereafter there is any 
clinically significant ECG abnormality  (as determined by the investigator), 3 consecutive  
ECGs separated by 5 to 10 minutes will be performed to confirm the abnormality at that visit.

 ECGs will be transmitted the same day they are taken to the central ECG laboratory for 
evaluation.  The ECG will be interpreted by a Central ECG laboratory cardi ologist.  The results 
of this over -read will be transmitted to the investigator.  The cardiologist at the central ECG 
laboratory will be available to consult with the investigator(s) on the interpretation of individual subject ECG recordings, as needed.  The corrected interval, as reported to the investigator by the Central ECG laboratory, will be QTc Fridericia (QTcF).  
An ECG abnormality may meet the criteria of an AE as described in this protocol (see  Section  
9.5.1.5) and the CRF Completion Guidelines.  In these instances, the AE corresponding to the 
ECG abnormality will be recorded on the Adverse Events CRF.

 9.5.2.1 Description of Procedures/Assessments Schedule 
For a description of the procedures and assessments see Table 4. 
9.5.3 Appropriateness of Measurements  
All clinical assessments are standard measurements commonly used in  Phase 2  studies of 
epilepsy in pediatric subjects. 
The safety assessments to be performed in this study, including hematology analyses, blood 
chemistry tests, and assessment of AEs, are standard evaluations to ensure subject safety.  
9.5.4 Reporting of Serious Adverse Events, Pregnancy, and Events Associated 
with Special Situations  
9.5.4.1 Reporting of Serious Adverse Events  
All SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS, regardless of their relationship to study treatment, must be reported on a completed SAE form by email or fax as soon as possible but no later than 24 hours from when the investigator becomes aware of the event.  
Serious adverse events, regardless of causality assessment, must be collected through the last visit (through the last visit in the Treatment Phase and for  28 days after the subject’s last dose).  
All SAEs must be followed to resolution or, if resolution is unlikely, to stabilization.  Any SAE judged by the investigator to be related to the study treatment or any protocol -required 
procedure should be reported to the sponsor regardless of the length of time that has passed 
since study completion. 
Detailed contact information for reporting of SAEs is provided in the Investigator Study File.  
For urgent safety issues, please ensure all appropriate medical care is administered to 
the subject and contact the appropriate study team member listed in the Investigator Study File.    
It is very important that the SAE report form be filled out as completely as possible at the time of the initial report.  This includes the investigator’s assessment of causality.  
Any follow -up information received on SAEs should be forwarded within 24 hours  of its 
receipt.  If the follow -up information changes the investigator’s assessment of causality, this 
should also be noted on the follow- up SAE form.  
Preliminary SAE reports should be followed as soon as possible by detailed descriptions 
including copies of hospital case reports, autopsy reports, and other documents requested by the sponsor.

 The investigator must notify his/her IRB/IEC of the occurrence of the SAE in writing, if 
required by their institution.  A copy of this communication must be forwarded to the sponsor to be filed in the sponsor’s Trial Master File.  
9.5.4.2 Reporting of Pregnancy and Exposure to Study Drug Through Breastfeeding 
Not applicable. 
9.5.4.3 Reporting of Events Associated with Special Situations 
REPORTING OF ADVERSE EVENTS ASSOCIATED WITH STUDY DRUG OVERDOSE , MISUSE , ABUSE , 
OR MEDICATION ERROR  
Adverse events associated with study drug overdose, misuse, abuse, and medication error refer 
to AEs associated with uses of the study drug outside of that specified by the protocol.  
Overdose, misuse, abuse, and medication error are defined as follows:  
Overdose Accidental or intentional use of the study drug in an amount higher than 
the protocol-defined dose  
Misuse  Intentional and inappropriate use of study drug not in accordance with the protocol. Intentional and inappropriate use of study drug not in 
accordance with the prescribed or authorized dose, route of administration, or indication (s) or use of prescription -only study drug 
without a prescription  
Abuse Sporadic or persistent intentional excessive use of study drug 
accompanied by harmful physical or psychological effects 
Medication error  Any unintentional  event  that causes or leads to inappropriate study drug 
use or subject harm while the study drug is in the cont rol of site  
personnel or the  subject.   
All AEs associated with overdose, misuse, abuse, or medication error  should be  captured  on 
the Adverse Event CRF  and also  reported using the procedures detailed in Reporting of Serious 
Adverse Events ( Section  9.5.4.1) even if the AEs do not meet serious criteria.  Abuse is always 
to be captured as an AE.  If the AE associated with an overdose, misuse, abuse, or medication error does not meet serious criteria, it must still be reported using the SAE form and in an expedited manner but should be noted as nonserious on the SAE form and the Adverse Event CRF.

time frames).  For this reason, it is imperative that sites provide complete SAE information in 
the manner described above.  
9.5.4.5 Breaking the Blind 
Not applicable. 
9.5.4.6 Regulatory Reporting of Adverse Events  
Adverse events will be reported by the sponsor or a third party acting on behalf of the sponsor to regulatory authorities in compliance with local and regional law and established guidance.  
The format of these reports will be dictated by the local and regional requirements. 
All studies that are conducted within any European country will comply with European Good  
Clinical Practice Directive 2005/28/EC and Clinical Trial Directive 2001/20/EC.  All SUSARs 
will be reported, as required, to the competent authorities of all involved European member states.  
9.5.5 Completion/Discontinuation of Subjects  
The investigator may withdraw the subject from the study at any time for safety or administrative reasons.  A subject may elect to discontinue the study at any time for any reason.  All subjects who discontinue the study are to complete the study’s early discontinuation procedure s indicated in the Schedule of Procedures/Assessments ( Table 4) and are to return 
for a Follow-up Visit 4 weeks ( ±6 days) after the last dose of study  drug.   
The investigator will promptly explain to the parent/guardian involved that the study will be 
discontinued for that subject and provide appropriate medical treatment and other necessary measures for the subject.  A subject who has ceased to return  for visits will be followed up by 
mail, phone, or other means to gather information such as the reason for failure to return, the status of treatment compliance, the presence or absence of AEs, and clinical courses of signs and symptoms.   
Subjects who discontinue early from the study will be discontinued for  one of these primary 
reasons:   AE(s), lost to follow -up, subject choice, withdrawal of consent, or 
administrative/ other.  In addition to the primary reason, the subject may indicate  one or more 
second ary reason (s) for discontinuation.  Study disposition information will be collected on 
the Subject Disposition CRF.  
A subject removed from the study for any reason may not be replaced.

 9.5.6 Abuse or Diversion of Study Drug 
During the course of the study, the investigator will report any concern about abuse or diversion 
of study drugs by completing the Abuse or Diversion of Study Drug CRF.  
Adverse events associated with abuse or diversion will be appropriately reported as AEs and monitored per Section 9.5.1.5. 
9.5.7 Confirmation of Medical Care by Another Physician  
The investigator will instruct subjects ’ parent(s)/ guardian (s) to inform site personnel when they 
are planning to receive medical care by another physician.  At each visit, the investigator will 
ask the subjects’ parent(s)/ guardian (s) whether the subject  has received medical care from 
another physician since the last visit or is planning to d o so in the future.  When the subject is 
going to receive medical care by another physician, the investigator, with the consent of the subject, will inform the other physician that the subject is participating in the clinical study.  
9.6 Data Quality Assurance  
This study will be organized, performed, and reported in compliance with the protocol, SOPs, working practice documents, and applicable regulations and guidelines.  Site audits may be  
conducted periodically by the sponsor’s or the CRO’s qualified complianc e auditing team, 
which is an independent function from the study team responsible for conduct of the study.   
9.6.1 Data Collection  
Data required by the protocol will be collected on the CRFs and entered into a validated data 
management system that is compliant with all regulatory requirements.  As defined by ICH guidelines, the CRF is a printed, optical, or electronic document designed to record all of the protocol-required information to be reported to the sponsor on each study subject.  
Data collection on the CRF must follow the instructions described in the CRF Completion 
Guidelines.  The investigator has ultimate responsibility for the collection and reporting of all clinical data entered on the CRF.  The investigator or designee as identified on Form  FDA  1572 
must sign the completed CRF to attest to its accuracy, authenticity, and completeness.  
Completed, original CRFs are the sole property of Eisai and should not be made available in any form to third parties without written permission from Eisai, except for authorized 
representatives of Eisai or appropriate regulatory authorities.  
9.6.2 Clinical Data Management  
All software applications used in the collection of data will be properly validated following standard computer system validation th at is compliant with all regulatory requirements.  All 
data, both CRF and external data (eg , laboratory data), will be entered into a clinical system.

 9.7 Statistical Methods  
All statistical analyses will be performed by the sponsor or designee after the study is 
completed and the database is locked and released (and a snapshot of the database is obtained 
and released).  Statistical analyses will be performed using SAS software or other validated 
statistical software as required.  Details of the statistical ana lyses will be included in a separate 
statistical analysis plan (SAP).  
9.7.1 Statistical and Analytical Plans  
The statistical analyses of study data are described in this section .  Further details of the 
analytical plan will be provided in the SAP, which will be finalized before database lock . 
9.7.1.1 Study Endpoints  
PRIMARY ENDPOINT  
• PK of perampanel during the Maintenance Period of the Core Study  (revised per 
Amendment 02)   
SECONDARY ENDPOINTS  
• Safety and tolerability  during the Core Study and the Extension Phase, which include 
incidence of treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs)  and SAEs, laboratory 
parameters, vital signs , and ECG parameters, and growth parameters ( height, weight, 
head circumference, thyroid function, and IGF-1 levels)  (revised per Amendment 02)   
EXPLORATORY ENDPOINTS  
The efficacy endpoints are:   
• Seizure frequency:  Percent change in 28 -day seizure frequency during the Treatment 
Phase and during the Extension Phase, compared to baseline  (revised per 
Amendment  02) 
• Responder rate:  Proportion of subjects with a 50% or greater reduction in 28 -day seizure 
frequency during the Maintenance Period and during the Extension Phase, compared to baseline (revised per Amendment 02) 
• Seizure -free rate:  Proportion of subjects who  are seizure- free during the Maintenance 
Period and during the Extension Phase 
• CGI-C at the end of the Core Study and the Extension Phase  
Details on endpoints for the Extension Phase can be found in Appendix 3. 
9.7.1.2 Definitions of Analysis Sets

 The Safety Analysis Set  is the group of subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug 
and had at least 1 postdose safety assessment.  
The Full Analysis Set (FAS) is the group of subjects who received study drug and had any 
seizure frequency data during the 2 weeks of Pretreatment Phase plus 4 weeks before the 
Pretreatment Phase and during the Treatment Phase.  
9.7.1.3 Subject Disposition  
A disposition or reason for discontinuation will be recorded for all entered subjects.  The 
frequencies of occurrence of each reason for discontinuation will be summarized.  The data 
will be described using incidence rate (number of subjects and percentage).  
9.7.1.4 Demographic and Other Baseline C haracteristics  
The demographics and baseline characteristics of the Safety Analysis Set will be summarized using descriptive statistics (n, mean, SD, median, minimum, and maximum) for the continuous 
variables such as age, and using numbers and percentages for categorical variables which includes sex, age group, and race. 
9.7.1.5 Prior and Concomitant Therapy  
Prior and concomitant medications will be assigned an 11 -digit code using the World Health 
Organization Drug Dictionary (WHO DD) drug codes.  Concomitant medic ations will be 
further coded to the appropriate Anatomical -Therapeutic -Chemical (ATC) code indicating 
therapeutic classification. Concomitant medications by drug and drug class will be tabulated and included in the clinical study report for this protocol.  
9.7.1.6 Efficacy Analys is 
This study is designed to assess PK and preliminary safety, tolerability and efficacy.  N o formal 
statistical analysis will be performed.  Summary statistics will be displayed for the following efficacy parameters in the FAS . 
Treatment Ph ase: 
• Seizure Frequency:  Percentage change in 28 -day seizure frequency during the Treatment 
Phase and the Extension P hase, compared to Baseline.  The primary analysis will use data 
prospectively collected during the 2 -week Pretreatment Phase to calculate baseline 28 -day 
seizure frequency.  A secondary analysis will use data prospectively collected during the 2-week Pretreatment Phase plus data retrospectively collected during the 4 week  period 
before Visit 1 to ca lculate baseline 28 -day seizure frequency.  Seizure frequency per 28 
days will be calculated as the number of seizures over the entire time interval divided by the number of days in the interval and multiplied by 28.  (revised per Amendment 02) 
• Responder R ate:  A responder is defined as a subject with atleast  50% decrease in 28- day 
seizure frequency while on treatment when compared to Baseline.  Analyses using the 2 
different baseline definitions above will be performed. For subjects who discontinue the

9.7.1.7 Pharmacokinetic, Pharmacodynamic, Pharmacogenomic , and Other Biomarker  
Analyses  
PHARMACOKINETIC ANALYSES  
Determination of PK will be performed on the PK Analysis Set.  Perampanel plasma 
concentrations will be listed.  
A population PK approach will be used to characterize the PK of perampanel.  The effect of 
intrinsic and extrinsic factors (age, body weight, gender, race, ALT, AST, creatinine clearance , 
and concomitant therapy with carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, valproic acid, lamotrigine, topiramate, primidone, zonisamide, levetiracetam and primidone ) 
on perampanel PK will be evaluated.  A 2-compartment disposition PK model  with line ar 
elimination  will be parameterized for absorption rate , oral clearance (CL/F) and apparent 
central and peripheral volumes of distribution (V
1/F and V 2/F).  Derived exposure parameters 
such as the steady state peak concentration (C max,ss), area under concentration vs time curve at 
steady state (AUC ss), and average steady -state drug concentration (C ss,av) will be calculated 
using the individual posterior estimates of PK parameters from the final PK model .  Descriptive 
statistics of the individual model -predicted PK parameters including but not limited (C max,s s 
will be provided. 
Due to the small sample size, population PK analysis will be performed using NONMEM with 
first- order conditional estimation with interaction  on data from this study pooled with existing 
rich data from 19 Phase 1 studies  and sparse data from  two Phase 2 studies (232 and 235), and 
5 Phase 3 Studies (304, 305, 306, 332 and 335).  A 2-compartment PK model will be fitted to 
the data and the effect of intrinsic and extrinsic factors, including body weight and age, on the PK of perampanel will be evaluated. The post -hoc estimates of both, maximum observed 
concentration ( C
max) and AUC from the final PK mode will be derived for all subjects.  
Subsequently, dose -normali zed derived exposure parameters will be summarised descriptively 
by age group (≤  6 months, > 6 to ≤ 12 months, >12 to < 24 months, ≥ 24 months to ≤4 years, 
>4 to ≤ 8 years, > 8 to < 12 years, ≥12 to < 18 years and ≥18 years) and also presented in box-plots , stratified by subjects taking and not taking EIAEDs.  Additionally, dose -norma lized 
derived exposure parameters will be summarized descriptively for the following age groups:  
1 to 24 months, 2 to ≤ 4 years, >4 to ≤ 8 years, >8 to <12 years, ≥12 to <18 years and ≥18

PHARMACODYNAMIC , PHARMACOGENOMIC , AND OTHER BIOMARKER  ANALYSES  
Not applicable. 
9.7.1.8 Safety Analyses  
Evaluation of safety will be performed on the Safety Analysis Set. 
EXTENT OF EXPOSURE  
Duration of Treatment Phase (Titration Period + Maintenance Period) exposure will be calculated as the number of days between the date the subject received the first dose of study 
drug and the date the subject received the last dose of study drug in the Treatment Phase.  
Overall study compliance rate for each subject will be calculated as the mean compliance rate 
over all the visits.  
ADVERSE EVENTS  
The AE verbatim descriptions ( investigator terms from the CRF) will be classified into 
standardized medical terminology using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA).  Adverse events will be coded to the MedDRA (Version 16.1 or higher) lower 
level term ( LLT) closest to the verbatim term.  The linked MedDRA preferred term ( PT) and 
primary system organ class ( SOC) are also captured in the database.  
A TEAE is defined as an AE that emerges during treatment, having been absent at pretreatment 
(Baseline) or  
• Reemerges during treatment, having been present at pretreatment ( Baseline) but stopped 
before treatment, or  
• Worsens in severity during treatment relative to the pretreatment state, when the AE is continuous. 
Only those AEs that  are treatment -emergent will be included in summary table s.  All AEs, 
treatment- emergent or otherwise, will be presented in subject data listing s. 
The TEAEs will be summarized by age group and by EIAED and non- EIAED .  The incidence 
of TEAEs will be reporte d as the number ( percentage) of subjects with TEAEs by SOC and 
PT.  A subject will be counted only once within a n SOC and PT, even if the subject experienced 
more than 1 TEAE within a specific SOC and PT.  The number ( percentage) of subjects with

 TEAEs wil l also be summarized by maximum severity ( mild, moderate, or severe)  and by 
relationship to study drug (Yes [related] and No [not related] ). 
The number ( percentage) of subjects with treatment -related TEAEs will be summarized by 
SOC and PT.  Treatment -related TEAEs include those events considered by the investigator to 
be related to study treatment.  The number ( percentage) of subjects with treatment -related 
TEAEs will also be summarized by maximum severity ( mild, moderate, or severe).  
Adverse events of special interest will also be summarized by SOC and PT using MedDRA 
SMQ terms.  
A subject data listing will be produced for all deaths, SAEs, and discontinuation due to an AE. 
Adverse events will be summarized using  the Safety Analysis Set.   
LABORATORY VALUES  
Laboratory results will be summarized using Système International (SI) units, as appropriate.  
For all quantitative parameters listed in Section  9.7.1.8, the actual value and the change from 
baseline to each postbaseline visit and to the end of treatment (defined as the last on -treatment 
value) will be summarized by visit and by age group using descriptive statistics.  Qualitative 
parameters listed in  Section 9.7.1.8 will be sum marized using frequencies ( number and 
percentage of subjects), and changes from baselin e to each postbaseline  visit and to end of 
treatment will be reported using shift table s.  Percentages will be based on the number of 
subjects with both nonmissing baseline and relevant postbaseline results. Laboratory test results will be assigned a low/normal/high ( LNH) classification according to 
whether the value was below ( L), within ( N), or above (H) the laboratory parameter’s reference 
range.  Within- treatment comparisons for each laboratory parameter will be based on 3 -by-3 
table s (shift table s) that compare the baseline LNH classification to the LNH classification at 
each postbaseline visit and at the end of treatment.  Similar shift table s will also compare the 
baseline LNH classification to the LNH classification for the highest and lowest value during 
the treatment period. 
Appendix 1 ( Sponsor’s Grading for Laboratory Values) presents the criteria that will be used 
to identify subjects with treatment- emergent mark edly abnormal laboratory values ( TEMAV s).  
Except for phosphate, a TEMAV is defined as a postbaseline value with an increase from 
baseline to a grade of 2 or higher.  For phosphate, a TEMAV was defined as a postbaseline value with an increase from baseline to a grade of 3 or higher.  When displaying the incidence 
of TEMAVs, each subject may be counted once in the laboratory parameter high and in the laboratory parameter low categories, as applicable.

ELECTROCARDIOGRAMS  
Descriptive statistics for ECG parameters and changes from baseline will be presented by visit and by age group. 
Shift table s will present changes from basel ine in ECG interpretation (categorized as normal; 
abnormal, not clinically significant; and abnormal, clinically significant) to end of treatment.  In addition, the number (percentage) of subjects with at least 1 postbaseline abnormal ECG 
result in QTcF during the treatment period will be summarized.  Clinically borderline and 
abnormal ECG results in QTcF  will be categorized as follows:  
Absolute QTc interval prolongation: 
• QTc interval  430-450 msec  
• QTc interval >4 50 msec  
• QTc interval > 500 msec  
Change from baseline in QTc interval:  
• QTC interval increases from baseline 30 -60 msec  
• QTC interval increases from baseline >60 msec  
OTHER SAFETY ANALYSES  
Growth  
Descriptive summary statistics of chan ges from baseline in height, weight , and head 
circumference will be evaluated for each cohort and overall.  This data will be compared with 
normative scores to assess clinical relevance.  
Changes from baseline for thyroid function and IGF -1 testing will be summarized.  
9.7.2 Determination of Sample Size  
Study E2007-G000- 238 will use population PK modeling to determine PK in pediatrics ≥1 to 
<24 months and from 2 to less than 4 years of age and compare these data to PK in adolescents  
and adults.  In Study E2007-G000-232, data were obtained in 42 pediatric subjects ≥ 2 to 
<12 years  of age , with approximate equal numbers enrolled in the age ranges of ≥2 to ≤ 6 and 
≥7 to <12 years .  (revised per Amendment 02) 
Given the narrower age range planned for Study 238 compared with Study 232, and the fact that the PK data from this stud y will be pooled with the data from subjects  ≥2 to <12 years of 
age, it is proposed that PK data obtained in at least 16 subjects ≥1 to <24 months of age would

 be adequate to characterize the PK in this age group.  The sample size will be increased to  at 
least 24 subjects if dose-normalized (to 8 mg) exposure in the Maintenance Period from the 
first 16 subjects in this study is not comparable to existing data in subjects aged ≥2 to 18 year s. 
In order to compare the PK of pediatric subjects aged 2 to <4 years of age with the PK of 
pediatric subjects aged >4 years of age, a total of 26 subjects with 13 EIAED subjects and 
13 non- EIAED subjects will be enrolled  and pooled across clinical studies of perampanel with 
PK assessment. This estimate of the required sample size assumes the inter -subject variability 
of 46.8% (CPMS -E2007-015-v1), equivalent to a coefficient of variation (CV) on the log scale 
of 0.445, that provides a sufficient number of subjects to target a 95% confidence interval 
within  60% and 140% of the point estimate for the geometric mean clearance of perampanel 
(equal to 0.638 L/h; determined using population PK modeling) with at least 80% power.   
(revised per Amendment 02) 
9.7.3 Interim Analysis  
After every 4 th subject in the age group 1 to less than 24 months completes the Maintenance 
Period an interim analysis (safety, tolerability, and PK) will be conducted where dose -
normalized exposure will be compared to that observed in other studies in subjects between ≥2 
and <18 years of age for  evidence of systematic deviations potentially warranting dose 
adjustment in this age group or for other subjects enrolled in the study.  PK data collected in 
older age cohort (2 to less than 4 years) will also be examined in the interim PK analyses.   
(revised per Amendment 02) 
All data from the Pretreatment and Treatment Phases (Core Study) will be analyzed when all 
subjects have completed the Maintenance Period.  In addition, a final analysis of data from the Pretreatment, Treatment, and Extension Phases will be analyzed when all subjects have completed the Extension Phase.  
An independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will be constructed to monitor the safety 
data.  The responsibilities, membership, and purpose of the DM C, the timing of the meeting(s), 
and an outline of the plan for review of the safety data will be documented in the DMC Charter.  
9.7.4 Other Statistical/Analytical Issues  
Not applicable. 
9.7.5 Procedure for Revising the Statistical Analysis Plan  
If the statistician determines that the analysis plan needs to be revised after this study starts, 
the person in charge of the analysis plan and the study director will examine the validity of the revision and the impact of the revision against the evaluation of this study and determine if the revision should be made.  The details of revision will be described in the clinical study report for this protocol.

 11 PROCEDURES AND INSTR UCTIONS (ADMINISTRATIVE 
PROCEDURES)  
11.1 Changes to the Protocol  
Any change to the protocol requires a written protocol amendment or administrative change 
that must be approved by the sponsor before implementation.  Amendments specifically affecting the safety of subjects, the scope of the investigation, or the scientific quality of the 
study require submission to health or regulatory authorities as well as additional approval by the applicable IRBs/IECs.  These requirements should in no way prevent any immediate action from being taken by the investigator, or by the sponsor, in the interest of preserving the safety of all subjects included in the study.  If the investigator determines that an immediate change to or deviation from the protocol is necessary for safety reasons to eliminate an immediate hazar d to the subjects, the sponsor’s medical monitor and the IRB/IEC for the site must be 
notified immediately.  The sponsor must notify the health or regulatory authority as required per local regulations. 
Protocol amendments that affect only administrative aspects of the study may not require 
submission to health or regulatory authority or the IRB/IEC, but the health or regulatory 
authority and IRB/IEC should be kept informed of such changes as required by local 
regulations.  In these cases, the sponsor may be required to send a letter to the IRB/IEC and the Competent Authorities detailing such changes. 
11.2 Adherence to the Protocol  
The investigator will conduct the study in strict accordance with the protocol ( refer to ICH  E6, 
Section  4.5). 
11.3 Monitoring Procedures  
The sponsor’s/CRO’s CRA will maintain contact with the investigator and designated staff by telephone, letter, or email between study visits.  Monitoring visits to each site will be conducted by the assigned CRA as described in the mon itoring plan.  The investigator will allow the CRA 
to inspect the clinical, laboratory, and pharmacy facilities to assure compliance with GCP and local regulatory requirements.  The CRFs and subject’s corresponding original medical records (source documents) are to be fully available for review by the sponsor’s representatives at 
regular intervals.  These reviews verify adherence to study protocol and data accuracy in accordance with local regulations.  All records at the site are subject to inspection by the local auditing agency and to IRB/IEC review.  
In accordance with ICH E6, Section  1.52, source documents include, but are not limited to, the 
following: 
• Clinic, office, or hospital charts

• Pain, quality of life, or medical history questionnaires completed by subjects 
• Records of telephone contacts  
• Diaries or evaluation checklists  
• Drug distribution and accountability logs maintained in pharmacies or by research personnel 
• Laboratory results and other laboratory test outputs (eg , urine pregnancy test result

• Correspondence regarding a study subject’s treatment between physicians or memo randa 
sent to the IRBs/IECs  
• CRF components (eg, questionnaires) that are completed directly by subjects and serve as 
their own source 
11.4 Recording of Data  
A CRF is required and must be completed for each subject by qualified and authorized personnel.  All data on the CRF must reflect the corresponding source document, except when a section  of the CRF itself is used as the source document.  Any correction to entries made on 
the CRF must be documented in a valid audit trail where the correction is dated, the ind ividual 
making the correct is identified , the reason for the change is stated, and the original data are 
not obscured.  Only data required by the protocol for the purposes of the study should be collected.  
The investigator must sign each CRF.  The investigator will report the CRFs to the sponsor 
and retain a copy of the CRFs. 
11.5 Identification of Source Data  
All data to be recorded on the CRF must reflect the corresponding source documents.   
11.6 Retention of Records  
The circumstances of completion or termination of the study notwithstanding, the investigator is responsible for retaining all study documents, including but not limited to the protocol, 
copies of CRFs, the Investigator's Brochure, and regulatory agency registration documents (eg , 
Form FDA 1572, ICFs, and IRB/IEC correspondence.  The site should plan to retain study

 documents, as directed by the sponsor, for at least 2 years after the last approval of a marketing 
application in an ICH region and until there  are no pending or contemplated marketing 
applications in an ICH region or at least 3 years have elapsed since the formal discontinuation of clinical development of the investigational product. 
It is requested that at the completion of the required retention period, or should the investigator 
retire or relocate, the investigator contact the sponsor, allowing the sponsor the option of permanently retaining the study records. 
11.7 Auditing Procedures and Inspection  
In addition to routine monitoring procedures, the  sponsor’s Clinical Quality Assurance 
department may conduct audits of clinical research activities in accordance with the sponsor’s 
SOPs to evaluate compliance with the principles of ICH GCP and all applicable local regulations. 
11.8 Handling of Study Drug  
Perampanel is a Schedule III Controlled Drug Substance in the United States.  
All study drug(s)  will be supplied to the principal investigator ( or a designated pharmacist) by 
the sponsor .  Drug supplies must be kept in an appropriate secure area (eg, locked ca binet) and 
stored according to the conditions specified on the drug labels.  The investigator ( or a 
designated pharmacist) must maintain an accurate record of the shipment and dispensing of the study drug in a drug accountability ledger, a copy of which must be given to the sponsor at the end of the study.  An accurate record of the date and amount of study drug dispensed to each subject must be available for inspection at any time.  The CRA will visit the site and review these documents along with all other study conduct documents at appropriate intervals once study drug has been received by the site. 
All drug supplies are to be used only for this study and not for any other purpose.  The 
investigator (or site personnel) must not destroy any drug labels or any partly used or unused 
drug supply before approval to do so by the sponsor.  At the conclusion of the study and as appropriate during the study, the investigator (or a designated pharmacist) will return all used 
and unused drug containers, drug labels, and a copy of the completed drug dispos ition form to 
the sponsor’s CRA. 
11.9 Publication of Results  
All manuscripts, abstracts, or other modes of presentation arising from the results of the study must be reviewed and approved in writing by the sponsor in advance of submission pursuant to the terms and conditions set forth in the executed Clinical Trial Agreement between the sponsor/CRO and the institution/investigator.  The review is aimed at protecting the sponsor's proprietary information existing either at the date of the commencement of the study or generated during the study.

 The detailed obligations regarding the publication of any data, material results, or other 
information generated or created in relation to the study shall be set out in the agreement between each investigator and the sponsor or CRO, as appropriate. 
11.10  Disclosure and Confidentiality  
The contents of this protocol and any amendments and results obtained during the study should be kept confidential by the investigator, the investigator’s staff , and the IRB/IEC and will not 
be disclosed in whole or in part to others, or used for any purpose other than reviewing or performing the study, without the written consent of the sponsor.  No data collected as part of this study will be used in any writte n work, including publications, without the written consent 
of the sponsor.  These obligations of confidentiality and non- use shall in no way diminish such 
obligations as set forth in either the Confidentiality Agreement or Clinical Trial Agreement executed between the sponsor/CRO and the institution/investigator. 
All persons assisting in the performance of this study must be bound by the obligations of 
confidentiality and non- use set forth in either the Confidentiality Agreement or Clinical Trial 
Agreement  executed between the institution/investigator and the sponsor/CRO. 
11.11  Discontinuation of Study  
The sponsor reserves the right to discontinue the study for medical reasons or any other reason at any time.  If a study is prematurely terminated or suspended, the sponsor will promptly inform the investigators/institutions and regulatory authorities of the termination or suspension and the reason( s) for the termination or suspension.  The IRB/IEC will also be informed 
promptly and provided the reason( s) for the te rmination or suspension by the sponsor or by the 
investigator/institution, as specified by the applicable regulatory requirement( s). 
The investigator reserves the right to discontinue the study should his/her judgment so dictate.  If the investigator terminates or suspends a study without prior agreement of the sponsor, the investigator should inform the institution where applicable, and the investigator/institution should promptly inform the sponsor and the IRB/IEC and provide the sponsor and the IRB/IEC with a detailed written explanation of the termination or suspension.  Study records must be 
retained as noted above. 
11.12  Subject Insurance and Indemnity  
The sponsor will provide insurance for any subjects participating in the study in accordance with all appli cable laws and regulations.

 Appendix 3  Extension Phase 
Eligibility Criteria  
Subjects who meet the following will be eligible to participate in the Extension Phase of this 
study: 
• Have completed the last visit of the Maintenance Period of the Core Study 
Study Design and Plan  
During the 32-36- week Maintenance Period of the Extension Phase, subjects will continue 
taking perampanel oral suspension, at the dose level achieved at the end of the Treatment Phase.  The maximum total daily dose a subject will be allowed is 12 mg for non- EIAED subjects and 
16 mg for EIAED subjects. 
Study Drug Supplies  
Perampanel  oral suspension will consist of the active ingredient, perampanel, and assorted 
excipients (all of which are considered appropriate for use in a pediatric population) suspended in a water -based medium.  The resulting suspension is opaque and practically white.  The 
formulation of perampanel 0.5 mg/mL oral suspension will be pr ovided by Eisai according  to 
current Good Manufacturing Practices .  
Perampanel is a Schedule III Controlled Substance in the United States and will be labeled as such for US sites.  
Perampanel oral suspension will be provided by Eisai to an Eisai -approved vendor in 400- mL 
PET bottles containing 340 mL of oral suspension. The approved vendor will label the bottles , 
place the bottles, suitably sized dosing devices (ie, oral syringes), and appropriately sized bottle adapters for accurate aliquotting (ie, PiBAs) into a tamper- evident sealed carton,  and ship them 
to the study sites. During the Extension Phase, parents/guardians will be provided with a bottle or bottles of suspension that can be redispensed or replaced at the next visit.   Each bottle 
provided will be in a tamper -evident sealed carton that will also contain oral syringes and 
PiBAs .  Instructions regarding routine dosage s during the Extension Phase  will be provided by 
the site. 
Treatments Administered  
• Maintenance Period (32-36 weeks) :  Subjects will continue taking perampanel oral 
suspension, at the dose level achieved at the end of the Treatment Phase.  The maximum 
total daily dose a subject will be allowed is 12  mg for non-EIAED  subjects or 16 mg 
for EIAED  subjects. 
Dose adjustment during this phase is allowed if necessary, per the investigator’s clinical judgment.  Subjects must return to the clinic for an unscheduled visit for any dose increase.  However, dose decreases can be done via telephone.

 All dose adjustments during this phase will be done by going one dose level up or 
down.  Subjects who do not tolerate a dose of  0.5 mg/day will be discontinued from the 
study. 
Changes of concomitant AEDs (addition, deletion or adjustment in dose) will be 
allowed. However, if changes do occur subjects should be carefully monitored, 
especially when switching between an EIAED  and a non- EIAED . 
• Follow- Up Period (4 weeks) :  No study drug will  be administered during Follow -up 
Period.  All subjects will be required to complete the Follow -up Period after their last 
dose in the Extension Phase, except for subjects who switch to commercially available perampanel or who enter EAP upon completion of study treatment. For these subjects, sites will conduct a telephone contact 28 (+6) days after t he last dose of study drug to 
follow adverse events ( AEs) and report any serious adverse events ( SAEs ) that occur 
within 28 days of the last study drug administration.  (revised per Amendment 02)

a: All visits to be done within ± 6 days of the schedule.  
b: The Follow -up Visit (4  weeks ± 6 days after the last dose of study medication) applies to those subjects who complete the entire study and 
those who discontinue early during the Extension Phase .  Subjects who switch to commercially available perampanel or who enter into EAP 
upon completion of study treatment will not need to under go Follow-up Visit; however, sites will conduct a telephone contact 28 (+6) days

c: Unused study drug to  be retrieved and study drug dispensed only for subjects requiring dose increases at Unscheduled Visits.  
d: As needed.  
e: For clinic visits other than those specified, physical and complete neurological exams, including evaluation of the cranial nerves, motor, 
sensory, brainstem, cerebellar, and autonomic functions, will only be performed when there is a complaint from the parent/guar dian.  Clinically 
significant abnormal findings from the physical or the neurological examinations must be reported as AEs.  
f: Two measurements of height/length should be taken.  Each measurement should be recorded as a separate entry on the Vital Sign CRF.  
g: Clinical laboratory tests include hematology and blood chemistry.  
h: Lipid and blood glucose tests must be conducted under fasting conditions , whenever practically feasible .  (revised per Amendment 02)  
i: During the unscheduled visits, clinical laboratory tests will only be done if an abnormality was noted at the previous visit or per the discretion 
of the investigator.  
j: If the su bject has a normal ECG baseline reading, but during any visit thereafter if there is any clinically significant ECG abnormali ty (as 
determined by the investigator), 3 consecutive ECGs separated by 5 to 10 minutes will be performed at that visit to confirm the abnormality.  
k: During the unscheduled visits, ECG will only be done if the results from the previous visit were deemed to be clinically sign ificant by the 
investigator.   
l: Telephone interviews with the parent/guardian will be conducted approximately 6 weeks following Visit 8 through Visit 11 to ensure that 
subjects are completing their seizure diaries regularly and assess AEs, study drug compliance and concomitant medications, in cluding AEDs 
and to remind the subjects that they are to complete their s eizure diary.  Subjects whose dose was decreased before the scheduled telephone 
interview will be strongly encouraged to return to the clinic (instead of the scheduled telephone interview) for further cons ultation with regard 
to study drug administration.  Subjects will then return for their regularly scheduled visits.   All subjects will have a telephone interview at 
approximately the midpoint between Visit 11 and the Follow -up Visit when drug has been stopped.  Subjects  who discontinue the study at any 
time will have a telephone interview at approximately the midpoint between the EOT Visit and the Follow -up Visit .  For subjects who will not 
need to undergo Follow -up Visit (eg, when switching to commercially available Fycompa or enetering  EAP after the last study drug 
administration), sites will conduct a telephone contact 28 (+6) days after the last dose of study drug to follow AEs and repo rt any SAEs that 
occur within 28 days of the last study drug administration.  (revised per Amendment  02)

 AE = Adverse event, AED = Anti -epileptic drug, CGI-C = Clinical Global Impression of Change , CRF = case report form, EAP = extended access 
program , ECG = electrocardiogram, EOT = End of Treatment, fT3 = free triiodothyronine, fT4 = free thyroxine, IGF -1 = insulin- like growth factor -
1, SAE = serious adverse event, TSH = thyroid -stimulating hormone . 
a: All visits to be done within ± 6 days of the schedule.  
b: The Follow -up Visit (4 weeks ± 6 days after the last dose of study medication) applies to those subjects who complete the entire study and 
those who discontinue early during the Extension Phase .  Subjects who switch to commercially available perampanel or who enter into EAP 
upon completion of study treatment would not need to under go Follow -up Visit; however, sites will conduct a telephone contact 28 ( +6) days 
after the last dose of study drug to follow AEs and report any SAEs that occur within 28 days of the last study drug administration.  (revised 
per Amendment 02)  
c: Unused study drug to be retrieved and study drug dispensed only for subjects requiring  dose increases at Unscheduled Visits.  
d: As needed.  
e: For clinic visits other than those specified, physical and complete neurological exams, including evaluation of the cranial nerves, motor, 
sensory, brainstem, cerebellar, and autonomic functions, will only be performed when there is a complaint from the parent/guardian.  Clinically 
significant abnormal findings from the physical or the neurological examinations must be reported as AEs.  
f: Two measurements of height/length should be taken.  Each measurement should be recorded as a separate entry on the Vital S ign CRF.  
g: Clinical laboratory tests include hematology and blood chemistry.  
h: Lipid and blood glucose tests must be conducted under fasting conditions, whenever practically feasible .  (revised per Amendment 02) . 
i: During the unscheduled visits, clinical labora tory tests will only be done if an abnormality was noted at the previous visit or per the discretion 
of the investigator.  
j: If the subject has a normal ECG baseline reading, but during any visit thereafter if there is any clinically significant ECG abnormality (as 
determined by the investigator), 3 consecutive ECGs separated by 5 to 10 minutes will be performed at that visit to confirm t he abnormality.  
k: During the unscheduled visits, ECG will only be done if the results from the previous visit were deemed to be clinically significant by the 
investigator.  
l: Telephone interviews with the parent/guardian will be conducted approximately  6 weeks following Visit 9 through Visit 11 and at 
approximately the midpoint between Visit 11 -12 to ensure that subjects are completing their seizure diaries regularly and assess AEs, study 
drug compliance and concomitant medications, including AEDs and to remind the subjects that they are to complete their seizur e diary.  
Subjects whose dose was decreased before the scheduled telephone interview will be strongly encouraged to return to the clinic (instead of the 
scheduled telephone interview) for further consultation with regard to study drug administration.  Subjects will then return for their regularly 
scheduled visits.   All subjects will have a telephone interview at approximately the midpoint between Visit 12 and the Follow -up Visit when 
drug has been stopped.  Subjects that discontinue the study at any time, will have a telephone interview at approximately the  midpoint betwe en 
the EOT V isit  and the Follow -up Visit .  For subjects who will not need to undergo Follow -up Visit (eg, when switching to commercially 
available Fycompa or enetering EAP after the last study drug administration), sites will conduct a telephone contact 2 8 (+6) days after the last 
dose of study drug to follow AEs and report any SAEs that occur within 28 days of the last study drug administration.  (revised per

 EXTENSION PHASE STATISTICAL ANALYSES  
All statistical analyses will be performed by the sponsor or designee. Statistical programming 
and analyses will be performed using SAS and/or other validated software. 
DEMOGRAPHICS  
Demographic and Baseline characteristics will be summarized.  For continuous variables ( eg, 
age, weight) the number of non- missing values, median, mean, standard deviation (SD), and 
minimum and maximum will be displayed. For categorical variables ( eg, gender, ethnicity) the 
counts and proportions of each value will be tabulated. A
NALYSIS OF EFFICACY  
Efficacy will be assessed in the Extension Phase with the following:  
• Seizure Frequency:  Percentag e change in 28- day seizure frequency in the Extension Phase 
compared to baseline.  The primary analysis will use data prospectively collected during 
the 2- week Pretreatment Phase to calculate baseline 28 -day seizure frequency.  A 
secondary analysis will us e data prospectively collected during the 2- week Pretreatment 
Phase plus data ret rospectively collected during the 4 week period before  Visit 1 to 
calculate baseline 28 -day seizure frequency.  (revised per Amendment 02) 
• Responder Rate:  A responder is defined as a subject with a 50% decrease in 28 -day seizure 
frequency during the Extension Phase when compared to baseline .  The responder rate will 
be summarized.  Analyses using the 2 different baseline definitions above wi ll be 
performed. 
• Seizure -free status:  The proportion of subjects who are seizure -free will be summarized 
during the Extension Phase

 ANALYSIS OF SAFETY  
The safety of the study population exposed to perampanel will be examined based on nature, 
frequency, and severity of AEs, chemistry and hematology laboratory tes t results, vital signs, 
and 12-l ead ECG abnormalities over the treatment period.  Any potential safety signal will be 
explored by analysis of safety data by dose achieved in the study. 
EXTENT  OF EXPOSURE  
Duration of Extension Phase exposure will be calculated as the number of days between the 
date the subject received the first dose of study drug and the date the subject received the last dose of study drug in the Extension Phase. 
Overall Extension Phase compliance rate for each subject will be calculated as the mean 
compliance rate over all the visits.  
A
DVERSE EVENTS  
Adverse events will be classified into standardized medical terminology from the verbatim description (investigator term) using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA).  Adverse events will be presented by preferred term nested within SOC.  Verbatim description and MedDRA level terms, for all AEs will be contained in the data listings of the clinical study report for this protocol.  
The TEAEs will be summarized by age group and by EIAED and non- EIAED groups.  The 
incidence of TEAEs will be reported as the number (percentage) of subjects with TEAEs by 
SOC and PT.  A subject will be counted only once within an SOC and PT, even if the subject experienced more than 1 TEAE within a specific SO C and PT.  The number (percentage) of 
subjects with TEAEs will also be summarized by maximum severity (mild, moderate, or severe)  and by relationship to study drug (Yes [related] and No [not related]). 
Adverse events of special interest will also be summarized by SOC and PT using MedDRA SMQ terms.  
A subject data listing will be produced for all deaths, SAEs, and discontinuation due to an AE. 
The number (percentage) of subjects with treatment -related TEAEs will be summarized by 
SOC and PT.  Treatment -related TEAEs include those events considered by the investigator to 
be related to study treatment.  The number (percentage) of subjects with treatment -related 
TEAEs will also be summarized by maximum severity  (mild, moderate, or severe).  
Treatment -emergent adverse events are defined as:  
• Adverse events that emerge during treatment, having been absent at pretreatment 
(Baseline)  
• Reemerge during treatment, having been present at Baseline but stopped prior to 
treatment

 • Worsen in severity during treatment relative to the pretreatment state, when the AE is 
continuous 
LABORATORY VALUES  
Clinical laboratory values will be evaluated for each laboratory parameter by subject.  Descriptive summary statistics ( eg, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, maximum) 
for the laboratory parameters and changes from baseline (Visit  1) to the last visit in the 
Extension Phase (Follow-up Visit, Week 56) will be summarized by cohort and overall. 
Laboratory test results will be as signed a low/normal/high (LNH) classification according to 
whether the value was below (L), within (N), or above (H) the laboratory parameter’s reference 
range.  Shift tables will be used to compare the baseline (Visit 1) LNH classification to the LNH clas sification at end of study. 
Clinical laboratory results post- baseline will be evaluated for markedly abnormal values. 
Appendix 1 presents the Sponsor’ s Grading for Laboratory Values that will be used to identify 
subjects with markedly abnormal laboratory values. For the incidence of markedly abnormal laboratory values, each subject may be counted once in the laboratory parameter value high 
and in the laboratory parameter low categories as applicable.  
V
ITAL SIGNS  
Vital sign values will be evaluated on an individual basis by subject.  Abnormal vital sign values will be identified as those outside (above or below) the reference range, where appropriate.  Reference ranges for vital sign parameters will be included in the clinical study report for this protocol.  De scriptive summary statistics (eg , mean, standard deviation, m edian, 
minimum, maximum) for vital sign parameters and changes from baseline (Visit 2) to each visit and to the last visit in the Extension Phase (Follow - up Visit, Week 56) will be evaluated 
for each cohort and overall. 
ECG
 RESULTS  
For 12-l ead ECG parameters, changes from baseline (Visit 1) to the last visit in the Extension 
Phase (Follow -up Visit, Week 56) will be summarized for each cohort and overall. 
QTc (Q TcF) and PR variables will also be analyzed to include a summary of the following: 
• Number of subjects with QTc in the borderline or abnormal category (430- 450 ms ec, 
>450 ms ec, and >500 ms ec) during treatment, and 
• Number of subjects with an increment of 30- 60 ms ec and > 60 ms ec from baseline (Visit 1).

Growth  
Descriptive summary statistics of changes from baseline in height and weight will be evaluated 
for each cohort and overall.  This data will be compared with normative scores to assess clinical 
relevance.  
Changes from baseline for thyroid function and IGF -1 testing will be summarized.

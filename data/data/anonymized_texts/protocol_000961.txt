Statistical 
Methodology:  This is a Phase II, open -label, n on-randomized study.  The study is designed to determine 
the PFS of nab -paclitaxel in combination with ramucirumab for patients as second -line 
therapy for metastatic gastroesophageal cancer.  
The historical median PFS is 2.8 months; we hypothesize that nab -paclitaxel plus 
ramucirumab will increase median PFS to 5 months.  With a 2 -sided alpha of 5% and 80% 
power, a total of 52 events (progressions or deaths) will need to be observed.  With an 18 -
month recruitment and 6 months follow -up, assuming 20% of patie nts recruited will be free 
from progression or death at the end of the study, 65 patients will need to be recruited into 
the study in order to observe 52 events.

 1. INTRODUCTION  
1.1 Background  
Adenocarcinoma of the esophagus and the gas troesophageal junction  (GE junction)  is the ninth 
most common cancer worldwide.   Late mortality rate is high with only 8% of patients surviving 
more than five years with a median survival of nine months .  Esophageal carcinoma affects adult 
patients in all ages with no difference in survival according to sex, racial background , or 
histological type.  Over the past two decades, a shift in the incident and lethality of the gastric 
cancer has been noted  in the Western countries. While incidents of distal gastri c cancers have 
decreased, the incidence of adenocarcinomas of the proximal stomach and distal esophagus has 
increased (Blot et al. 1991 ; Pera et al. 1993 ; Devesa  et al. 1998 ).  In addition, the unique 
behavior of these proximal tumors makes them  challenging to treat. These tumors are often 
located at the crossr oads of two major body cavities; therefore, the lymphatic spread of the 
disease may occur in two directions —proximally int o the mediastinum and distally to the celiac 
lymph nodes  (Lerut  et al. 2004 ). As a result, these tumors remain undiagnosed at an early stage 
and patients often present with a relatively advanced stage  disease  (Ajani  et al. 200 4). 
1.2 Treatment for Metastatic Gastroesophageal Tumors  
A multitude of trials in the metastatic setting exist for both esophageal and gastric 
adenocarcinoma, the preponderance including GE junctional tumors .  Despite this abundance, 
there is no regimen in either disease that can achieve  more than marginal success or superiority .  
As with most chemotherapy, combination regimens seem to be better for initial response, but this 
does not necessarily translate into survival.  
Currently, multipl e regimens are used in the treatment of metastatic esophagogastric cancers.  
These include: cisplatin and fluorouracil ( 5-FU) or CF, epirubicin, cisplatin, and 5 -FU (ECF), 
epirubicin, oxaliplatin, and 5 -FU (EOX), cisplatin and irinotecan, docetaxel, cispla tin, and 5 -FU 
(DCF).  The current United States Food and Drug Administration  (FDA ) standard comparator 
regimen is a combination of 5 -FU and cisplatin.  Until recently, t here was no FDA standard 
comparator except best supportive care in the second line sett ing.  There is data on the efficacy 
of taxane -based therapy in the second -line setting after progression on a prior platinum -based 
regimen.  Studies have shown response rates of second line paclitaxel or docetaxel to range from 
20% to 30%.  Trials evaluati ng docetaxel or paclitaxel in this setting have shown time to 
treatment failure rates in the range of 2 -5 months.  The COUGAR trial was a randomized Phase 
III study that randomized second -line gastric cancer patients to docetaxel every three weeks or 
best supportive care.  Patient s who received docetaxel had an improved overall survival  (OS)  of 
5.2 months  compared to  3.6 months ( hazard ration [ HR] 0.67).  Response rate  (RR)  to docetaxel 
was 7% ( Ford  et al. 2012 ).  A recent randomized Phase III study of the anti -vascular endothelial 
growth factor receptor -2 (VEGFR2 ) antibody ramucirumab versus best supportive care for 
second -line treatment of gastric cancers showed an improved OS akin to docetaxel (5.2 vs. 2.6 
months)  and improved  progression -free survival  (PFS) (2.1 vs. 1.3 months) ( Fuchs et al. 2012 ).  
Given the utilization of taxanes as second -line therapy , the RAINBOW study evaluated weekly 
paclitaxel plus or minus ramuciru mab.  This study showed an improvement in PFS (4.40 vs. 2.86

 months, HR 0.635) and OS (9.63 vs. 7.63  months, HR 0.807) for patients who received the 
combination of paclitaxel and ramucirumab ( Wilke  et al. 2014 ).  The FDA approved 
ramucirumab for treatment of patients in the second -line setting in April  2014 . 
1.3 Nab-paclitaxel  
Nab-paclitaxel  (Abraxane® [ABI-007]) is a proprietary solvent -free, protein -stabilized 
formulation of paclitaxel , which also contains  human albumin in a noncryst alline amorphous 
state, with a mean particle size of approximately 130 nanometers .  Paclitaxel enhances the 
polymerization of tubulin to stable microtubules and also interacts directly with microtubules, 
stabilizing them against depolymerisation.  The high ly stable tubulin complexes lead to the 
formation of discordant and dysfunctiona l microtubule arrays , visible as "bundles" during mitotic 
cell division and result s in apoptosis and cell death.   Nab-paclitaxel has a similar mode of action 
and was developed to improve the therapeutic index and reduce toxicity , and can be administered 
via the intravenous (IV) route .   
Nab-paclitaxel  uses a receptor -mediated transport process allowing transcytosis across the 
endothelial cell wall, thereby breaching  the blood/tu mor interface.  This albumin -specific 
receptor mediated process involves the binding of a specific receptor (gp60) on the endothelial 
cell wall, resulting in the activation caveolin -1, which initiates an opening in the endothelial wall 
with formation of a little caves or caveolae, with transport of the albumin -bound 
chemotherapeutic complex via these caveolae to the underlying tumor interstitium.  A protein 
specifically secreted by the tumor (SPARC) binds and entraps the albumin, allowing release of 
the hyd rophobic drug to the tumor cell membrane.   Nab-paclitaxel  is the first biologically 
interactive nanoparticle that exploits the  gp-60/caveolin -1/SPARC pathway  to enhance  intra-
tumoral concentration of the drug thereby significantly  reducing normal tissue  toxicity .  Clinical 
studies have demonstrated less toxicity with nab-paclitaxel  compared to  solvent -based paclitaxel .

 Figure 1 Mechanism of transport and accumulation of nab -paclitaxel in tumor cells   
 
As of October 2013, nab-paclitaxel  has been approved in over 40 countries/regions, for the 
treatment of patients with metastatic breast cancer , as well as for the  first-line treatment of 
locally advanced or metastatic non -small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and m etastatic 
adenocarcinoma of the pancreas.  
1.4 Ramucirumab  
Angiogenesis is required for cancer progression and establishment of metastatic lesions in distant 
organs.  Vascular endothelial growth factor receptor -2 (VEGFR -2) is considered a key factor in 
cancer -associated angiogenesis, and is substantially expressed and associated with negative 
prognostic features in gastroesophageal and other cancers.   Anti-VEGFR -2 antibodies have been 
shown to inhibit VEGF -stimulated receptor activation and proliferation of huma n leukemia cells 
(Lu et al. 2002 ; Lu et al. 2003 ).  Therefore, these antibodies hold promise for further therapeutic 
application in other types of cancers including solid tumors and hematologic tumors, su ch as 
leukemia and lymphomas.   
Ramucirumab (IMC -1121B [LY3009806]) is a recombinant human monoclonal antibody that 
specifically binds to the extracellular domain of the VEGF R-2.  The binding of ramucirumab to 
VEGF R-2 prevents its interaction with activatin g ligands (VEGF -A, VEGF -C, and VEGF -D) 
and blocks activation of  VEGF R-2 and its downstream intracellular signaling components,

 including p44/p42 mitogen -activated protein kinases, inhibiting ligand -induced proliferation and 
migration of human endothelial c ells. 
1.5 Rationale for the Study  
The REGARD  trial ( Fuchs et al. 2012 ) showed  that ramucirumab was beneficial in patients with 
cancers of the esophagus and stomach.  The RAINBOW trial ( Wilke  et al. 2014 ) demonstrated a 
beneficial effect on the OS when ramucirumab plus paclitaxel was used, compared to paclitaxel 
alone.  However, neutropenia was more frequently reported in the combination arm.   
The Phase II  study  we propose uses an albumin -based  formulation of paclitaxel, which may 
potentially increase the tumor up take of the drug, improving efficacy and minimizing the side 
effects.  The biological rationale of using this combination is that ramucirumab will inhibit tumor 
angiogenesis and nab-paclitaxel  will induce apoptosis of the rapidly dividing tumor cell.  
2. STUDY  OBJECTIVES

Dose adjustments at the start of a subsequent cycle should be based on nadir hematologic counts 
or maximum non -hematologic toxicity from the preceding cycle of therapy.  Treatment may be 
delayed to allow sufficient time for recovery.  If dose modification below dose level -1 is 
required in a patient receiving benefit, the schedule of one or both drugs may be modified with 
approval of the Study Chair.  
If the investigator believes the  toxicity to be due to only one of the study agents, that agent may 
be held and/or dose reduced and treatment with the other agent may continue.  
All dose reductions will be made from the planned dosages, with a maximum allowable 
treatment delay of 3 weeks during chemotherapy.  If toxicity remains unresolved, the patient will 
discontinue the offending study agent and treatment  with the other agent may continue .  Patients 
should be evaluated weekly (at a minimum), if therapy is on hold.  
The dose level reducti ons to be used in this study  are shown in Table 1.  No dose re -escalation is 
allowed.

6.1 Dose Modifications Due to Hematologic Toxicity  
6.1.1 Administration of Nab -Paclitaxel to Patients with Abnormal Hematologic 
Function  
Nab-paclitaxel dosing should not be administered at the start of each cycle u ntil the ANC returns 
to ≥1.5 x 109 cells/L and the platelet count returns to ≥100  x 109 cells/L.  For patients receiving 
weekly nab -paclitaxel, for each subsequent dose of nab -paclitaxel within a cycle (Days 8 and 
15), patients must have an ANC ≥1.0 x 109 cells/L and platelets >75 x 109 cells/L.  If the ANC 
and platelets are not adequate for treatment on Day  8 and/or 15, the dose will be omitted, but the 
total cycle length will remain the same.  
6.1.2 Dose Reductions and Guidelines for Optional use of Growth Facto rs for 
Hematologic Toxicity  
Prophylactic G -CSF use is not permitted during Cycle 1.  Table 2 provides a guideline for 
implementing dose reductions and optional use of growth factor treatment for hematologic 
toxicity.

G-CSF Administration  
For weekly nab -paclitaxel administration, administer G -CSF 5 mcg/kg/day (rounded to the 
nearest vial size per investigator/institution’s standard of care) 24 hours after chemotherapy and 
hold 48 hours prior to the next dose.  
6.2 Dose Modifications Due to Non -Hem atologic Toxicity  
Dose modifications for non -hematologic toxicities for nab -paclitaxel and ramucirumab are 
addressed in this section.  
6.2.1 Nab-Paclitaxel Non -Hematologic Dose Modifications  
6.2.1.1  Administration of Nab -Paclitaxel to Patients with Abnormal Hepatic Funct ion 
Nab-paclitaxel  should only be administered if hepatic function is within the parameters 
established in the eligibility criteria.  Hepatic toxicity from taxanes may occur, but it is 
uncommon.  Therefore, hepatic dysfunction that occurs while the patient  is on study should 
prompt an evaluation to determine the cause, including the possibility of progressive metastatic 
disease and hepatotoxicity from concurrent medications.

Page 29 of 65 
 6.2.1.2  Sensory Neuropathy  
Nab-paclitaxel  should be withheld in patients who experi ence ≥ Grade 3 sensory neuropathy.  
Treatment may be resumed at the next lower dose level (see Table 1) in subsequent cycles after 
the sensory neuropathy improves to ≤ Grade 1.  The time to resolution to ≤ Grade  1 should be the 
AE duration used for AE reporting.  In those patients who experience Grade 4 sensory 
neuropathy, study drug should be withheld, and treatment resumed at a reduction of 2 dose levels 
(Dose Level -2; see Table 1) in subsequent cycles after the sensory neuropathy improves to 
≤ Grade 1.  Note: the investigator may elect to dose modify for Grade 3 sensory neuropathy.  
6.2.1.3  Hypersensitivity Reactions  
Hypersensitivity reactions rarely occur with nab -paclitaxel.  If they do occur, minor symptoms 
such as flushing, skin reactions, dyspnea, lower back pain, hypotension, or tachycardia may 
require temporary interruption of the infusion.  Patients with mild or moderate reactions may be 
premedicated per institutional standard and may continue treatment.  However, severe reactions, 
such as hypotension requiring treatment, dyspnea requiring bronchodilators, angioedema or 
generalized urticaria require immediate discontinuation of nab -paclitaxel administration and 
aggressive symptomatic therapy.  Patients who  experience a severe hypersensitivity reaction to 
nab-paclitaxel should not be re -challenged.  It is not recommended to administer nab -paclitaxel 
to patients with prior hypersensitivity to a taxane.   
6.2.2 Ramucirumab  Non-Hematologic  Toxicity  
6.2.2.1  Infusion Related Re actions  
As with other monoclonal antibodies, infusion -related reactions may occur during or following 
ramucirumab administration.  Patients should be closely monitored for signs and symptoms 
indicative of an infusion -related reaction starting with the init iation of the infusion until at least 
1 hour after the end of the infusion in an area where resuscitation equipment and other agents 
(e.g., epinephrine, corticosteroids) are readily available.  
The following are treatment guidelines for infusion -related rea ctions:  
Grade 1  
• Slow the infusion rate by 50%.  
• Monitor the patient for worsening of condition.  
• After symptoms resolve, medication may resume at previous rate per investigator’s 
discretion.  
• For subsequent infusions, premedicate with diphenhydramine hydrochl oride 50 mg IV 
(or equivalent); additional premedication may be administered at the investigator’s 
discretion.  
Grade 2  
• Stop the infusion.  
• Administer diphenhydramine hydrochloride 50 mg IV (or equivalent), acetaminophen 
650 mg orally for fever, and oxygen

FINAL PROTOCOL  DATE :  18 NOVEMBER  2014       VERSION 1.0 
Page 30 of 65 
 • Resume the infusion at 50% of the prior rate once the infusion -related reaction  has 
resolved or decreased to Grade 1; the infusion duration should not exceed  2 hours.  
• Monitor for worsening of condition.  
• For subsequent infusions, premedicate with diphenhydra mine hydrochloride  50 mg IV 
(or equivalent); additional premedication may be administered at  the investigator’s 
discretion.  
For a second Grade 1 or 2 infusion -related reaction, administer dexamethasone 8 to 10 mg IV (or  
equivalent); then, for subsequent in fusions, premedicate with diphenhydramine hydrochloride  
50 mg IV (or equivalent), acetaminophen 650 mg orally, and dexamethasone 8 to 10 mg IV (or  
equivalent).  
Grade 3  
• Stop the infusion and disconnect the infusion tubing from the patient.  
• Administer diphen hydramine hydrochloride 50 mg IV (or equivalent),  dexamethasone 8 
to 10 mg IV (or equivalent), bronchodilators for  bronchospasm, and other 
medications/treatment as medically indicated.  
• Patients who have a Grade 3 infusion -related reaction will not receive further  
ramucirumab , but will continue on nab -paclitaxel . 
Grade 4  
• Stop the infusion and disconnect the infusion tubing from the patient.  
• Administer diphenhydramine hydrochloride 50 mg IV (or equivalent),  dexamethasone 8 
to 10 mg IV (or equivalent), and oth er medications/treatment as medically indicated.  
• Give epinephrine or bronchodilators as indicated.  
• Hospital admission for observation may be indicated.  
• Patients who have a Grade 4 infusion -related reaction will not receive further  
ramucirumab , but will con tinue to be followed on on nab -paclitaxel . 
6.2.2.2  Hypertension  
The following are treatment guidelines for hypertension that develops during the study:  
Grade <3  
• If the hypertension is not associated with symptoms, continue ramucirumab  and initiate 
antihypertensive  therapy.  
• If the hypertension is associated with symptoms, hold ramucirumab  until symptoms 
resolve and initiate antihypertensive therapy.  
• If ramucirumab  is held for hypertension (that is, symptomatic  hypertension, markedly 
elevated blood pressure unrespons ive to  antihypertensive therapy), the dose of 
ramucirumab  should be  reduced upon re -treatment  (resolution to Grade 1)  to 6 mg/kg 
 
CONFIDENTIAL

Page 31 of 65 
 every 2 weeks.   A second dose  reduction to 5 mg/kg every 2 weeks should be undertaken 
if an additional  postponement of ramuciru mab is required.  
Grade 3 (systolic BP ≥160 mm Hg or diastolic BP ≥100 mm Hg; medical  intervention indicated; 
more than 1 drug or more intensive therapy than previously used  indicated) . 
• For Grade 3 hypertension not associated with symptoms, continue  ramucir umab  with 
more intensive antihypertensive therapy.   If systolic BP remains ≥160 mm Hg or diastolic 
BP ≥100 mm Hg >2 weeks after  initiation of additional antihypertensive therapy, hold 
ramucirumab  while continuing appropriate antihypertensive therapy  (resol ution to Grade 
1). 
• If the hypertension is associated with symptoms, hold ramucirumab  until symptoms 
resolve and initiate antihypertensive therapy.  
• If ramucirumab  is held for hypertension (that is, symptomatic  hypertension, markedly 
elevated blood pressure unresponsive to  antihypertensive therapy), the dose of 
ramucirumab  should be  reduced upon re -treatment to 6 mg/kg every 2 weeks.  A second 
dose reduction to 5 mg/kg every 2 weeks should be undertaken if an additional  
postponement of ramucirumab  is required . 
Grade 4 or refractory  
• Patients with Grade 4 hypertension (life -threatening consequences; for  example, 
malignant hypertension, transient or permanent neurologic deficit,  hypertensive crisis; or 
urgent intervention indicated) or patients whose  hypertension  is poorly controlled 
(>160  mm Hg systolic or >100 mm Hg  diastolic for >4 weeks) despite appropriate oral 
medication (>2 oral agents at  maximum tolerated dose) will be discontinued from 
ramucirumab .   
6.2.2.3  Proteinuria  
If, while on ramucirumab therapy, a patient  has proteinuria ≥2+ per a dipstick or routine 
urinalysis, ramucirumab therapy will continue as scheduled, and a 24 -hour urine collection will 
be conducted prior to the subsequent scheduled treatment cycle.  If the protein level is <2 g/24 
hours, the patie nt will continue on ramucirumab therapy at the same dose without interrupt ion.  
If the protein level is ≥2  g/24 hours, hold ramucirumab therapy for that treatment  and a 24 -hour 
urine collection will be repeated.  Ramucirumab treatment will resume at 6 mg/k g once the 
protein level returns to <2 g/24 hours.  A second dose reduction of ramucirumab to 5 mg/kg  is 
permitted if proteinuria ≥2 g/24 hours recurs.  The patient will be discontinued from 
ramucirumab treatment if the protein level is >3 g/24 hours, if t here is a third occurrence of 
proteinuria ≥2 g/24 hours, or if the protein level does not return to <2 g/24 hours within 3 weeks.  
6.2.2.4  Thromboembolic Events  
Ramucirumab therapy should be discontinued in the event of any Grade 3/4 ATE or any 
Grade  3/4 venous thr omboembolism that is considered by the investigator to be life -threatening, 
or symptomatic and not adequately treated by anticoagulation therapy.  Ramucirumab therapy 
may be continued in the setting of an incidentally diagnosed, asymptomatic deep vein thro mbosis 
or pulmonary embolism, or following a symptomatic deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary

 10. STATIST ICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
10.1 Statistical Design  
This is a Phase II, open -label, non -randomized study .  The study is designed to  determine the 
PFS of nab-paclitaxel  in combination with ramucirumab for patients as second -line therapy for 
metastatic gastroesophageal c ancer . 
10.2 Sample Size Considerations  
This study seeks to improve median PFS in this patient population.   The historical median PFS is 
2.8 months; we hypothesize that nab -paclitaxel plus ramucirumab will increase median PFS to 
5 months.  With a 2 -sided alpha o f 5% and 80% power, a total of 52 events (progressions or 
deaths) will need to be observed.   With  an 18-month recruitment and 6 months follow -up, 
assuming  20% of patients recruited will be free from progression or death at the end of the study, 
65 patients  will need to be recruited into the study in order to observe 52 events.  
10.3 Analysis Population s 
The following analysis populations will be used:  
• Full Analysis Set is defined as all patients who are enrolled in the study.  
• Safety Analysis Set is defined as pat ients  in the Full Analysis Set  who have received at 
least one dose of study treatment . 
• Efficacy Analysis Set is defined as patients in the Full Analysis Set  who have received at 
least one dose of study treatment  and have a baseline tumor assessment . 
• Per Pr otocol  Set is defined as patients in the Efficacy Analysis Set who received at least 
75% of their intended starting doses of both  nab-paclitaxel and ramucirumab study 
treatment during Cycles 1 and 2, and who either have at least one post -baseline tumor 
assessment, or who discontinued the study prior to their first post -baseline tumor 
assessment due to death or objective disease progression.    
10.4 Data Analysis  
Data will be summarized by using counts and percent ages for discrete parameters, and by 
descriptive st atistics (number of observations, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum and 
maximum) for continuous parameters.  Baseline data to be tabulated will include demographic 
features such as gender, age, and race, as well as disease specific characteristics.   The number 
and percentage of patients who complete the study or who withdraw for any reason will be 
presented.  
Descriptive statistics, including mean, median, standard deviations and ranges for all continuous 
measures will be tabulated and reported.  Per centages and frequencies for all categorical 
measures will also be presented.  Time to events endpoints will be reported using Kaplan -Meier 
estimates, with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for median time to event.  
All analyses will be performed using SAS ver sion 9.3 or later.

Analyses of PFS, TTP , OS, ORR and Disease Control Rate (DCR) will be performed using the 
Efficacy Analysis Set.  
• PFS is defined as the time from the first day of study drug administration ( Day 1) to 
objective disease progress ion as defined by the RECIST v1.1 criteria, or death on study 
from any cause .  Patients who are alive and free from disease progression will be 
censored at the date of last  adequate  tumor assessment .  If no adequate post -treatment 
tumor assessments were ob tained for a patient, PFS will censored at Day  1.  PFS is the 
primary endpoint variable in this study.  
 
• TTP is defined as the time from the first day of study drug administration ( Day 1) to 
objective disease progression as defined by the RECIST v1.1 criter ia.  Patients who are 
alive and free from disease progression will be censored at the date of last  adequate  
tumor assessment .  If no adequate post -treatment tumor assessments were obtained for a 
patient, TTP will censored at Day  1. 
 
• OS is defined as the ti me from the first day of study drug administration ( Day 1) to death 
from any cause .  Patients who are alive will be censored at the date of last known alive . 
 
• ORR is defined as the proportion of patients with confirmed complete response (CR) or 
confirmed partial response (PR), i.e., two  CRs and/or PRs at least 4 weeks apart,  
according to the  RECIST v1.1 criteria.  
 
• DCR is defined as the proportion of patients with best response of confirmed CR, 
confirmed PR, or SD, according to the RECIST v1.1 criteria.  
 
o For ORR and DCR, patients without a post -baseline tumor assessment will be 
classified as not evaluable (NE) and considered as non -responders in the efficacy 
analyses.  
For PFS , TTP  and OS, Kaplan -Meier curves will be generated and the median time to event and  
the associated 95% CI be provided.  
For ORR and DCR, the estimates and the associated 95% CI (based on the Wald normal 
approximation method) will be calculated.

 Efficacy analyses will be repeated on each of the efficacy endpoint variables (PFS, TTP, OS, 
ORR, and DCR) using the Per Protocol  Set. 
10.4.3  Safety Analysis  
Safety analyses will be performed for all patients in the Safety Analysis Set.  
Safety (discussed in Section 11) will be assessed through the analysis of the reported incid ence 
of adverse events (AEs), treatment -emergent AEs (TEAEs), serious AEs (SAEs), AEs leading to 
treatment discontinuation, events of at least CTCAE Version 4.0 3 Grade 3 in severity, and AEs 
related to study treatment.  Laboratory data and other safety dat a will be summarized as 
appropriate.  A copy of CTCAE scoring system may be downloaded from: 
http:// evs.nci.nih.gov/ftp1/CTCAE/CTCAE_4.03_2010 -06-14_QuickReference_8.5x11.pdf . 
The AEs will be coded using Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA), and 
summarized using system organ class and preferred term.  In addition, summaries of TEAEs , 
SAEs, AEs leading to treatment discontinuation, AEs by maximum NCI CTCAE grade, and AEs 
related to study t reatment will also be presented.  
Laboratory results (observed values and changed from baseline) will be listed and summarized 
by visit.  CTCAE grade s will be applied to laboratory parameters where applicable.   Summaries 
of NCI CTCAE Version 4.03 grading and shifts from baseline will be tabulated as appropriate.  
Vital signs parameters (observed values and change from baseline) will be listed and 
summar ized by visit.  
ECG and ECOG performance status findings will be listed and summarized by visit.  
10.5 Analysis Time Points  
10.5.1  Final Analysis  
The final analysis of the study will occur when  a total of at least 52 PFS events have been 
observed.  
10.5.2  Safety Review  
There a re no scheduled  interim safety reviews planned for this study.  
10.5.3  Efficacy Review  
There are no scheduled  interim  efficacy analyses planned for this study.  
11. SAFETY REPORTING AND  ANALYSES  
Safety assessments will consist of monitoring and recording protocol -defin ed AEs and SAEs, 
measurement of protocol -specified hematology, clinical chemistry, and other protocol -specified 
tests that are deemed critical to the safety evaluation of the study drug.  
The Principal Investigator is responsible for recognizing and reporti ng AEs to the SCRI  
Innovations  Safety Department (SD) (see Section 11.1.5 ).  It is SCRI Innovations  responsibility

 to report relevant SAEs to the applicable local  or national regulatory bodies.  In addition, 
Investigators must report SAEs and follow -up information to their responsible Institutional 
Review Board (IRB) according to the policies of that IRB.  
The Principal Investigator is also responsible for ensuring that every staff member involved in 
the study is  familiar with the content of this section.  
11.1 Definitions   
11.1.1  Adverse Events  
Adverse event means any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in 
humans, whether or not considered drug related.  An AE (also known as adverse experience) can 
be any unfavorable and unintended sign (e.g., an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or 
disease temporarily associated with the use of a drug, without any judgement about causality.   
An AE can arise with any use of the drug (e.g., off -label use, use in combination with another 
drug) and with any route of administration, formulation, dose or including overdose.  
11.1.2  Serious Adverse Event  
An AE or a suspected adverse reaction (SAR) is considered “serious” if it results in any of 
the following outcomes:  
• Death  
• A life-threatening AE  
• Inpatient hospitalization of at least 24 -hours or prolongation of existing 
hospitalization  
• A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to 
conduct normal life functions  
• A congenital anomaly/birth defec t 
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospitalization may be considered serious when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they 
may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical  intervention to prevent 
one of the outcomes listed in this definition.  Examples of such medical events include allergic 
bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias 
or convulsions that do not result in hosp italization, or development of drug dependency or drug 
abuse.   
It is important to distinguish between “serious” and “severe” AE s, as the terms are not 
synonymous.  Severity is a measure of intensity; however, an AE of severe intensity need not 
necessarily  be considered serious.  Seriousness serves as the guide for defining regulatory 
reporting obligations.  “Serious” is a regulatory definition and is based on patient/event outcome 
or action usually associated with events that pose a threat to a patient’s l ife or vital functions.  
For example, nausea which persists for several hours may be considered severe nausea, but may 
not be considered an SAE.  On the other hand, a stroke which results in only a limited degree of 
disability may be considered only a mild  stroke, but would be considered an SAE.  Severity and

Page 41 of 65 
 seriousness should be independently assessed when recording AEs on the eCRF and SAEs on the 
SAE Report Form.  
11.1.3  Adverse Reaction  
An adverse reaction  (AR)  means any AE caused by a drug.  Adverse reactions are a subset of all 
SARs  where there is a reason to conclude that the drug caused the event.  
11.1.4  Suspected Adverse Reaction  
Suspected adverse reaction  (SAR)  means any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility that 
the drug caused the AE.  Reasonable possi bility means that there is evidence to suggest a causal 
relationship between the drug and the AE.  A SAR  implies a lesser degree of certainty about 
causality than AR, which means any AE caused by a drug.  
11.1.5  Recording and Reporting of Adverse Events  
Recording of Adverse Events  
All AEs of any patient during the course of the research study will be recorded in the eCRF, and 
the investigator will give his or her opinion as to the relationship of the AE to the study drug 
treatment (i.e., whether the event is relate d or unrelated to study drug administration).  
All AEs should be documented.  A description of the event, including its date of onset and 
resolution, whether it constitutes a n SAE or not, any action taken (e.g., changes to study 
treatment), and outcome, sho uld be provided, along with the investigator’s assessment of 
causality (i.e., the relationship to the study treatment[s]).  For an AE to be a suspected treatment -
related event , there should be at least a reasonable possibility of a causal relationship betw een the 
protocol treatment and the AE.  Adverse events will be graded according to the NCI CTCAE 
v4.03, and changes will be documented.  
If the AE is serious, it should be reported immediately to SCRI  Innovations  SD.  Other untoward 
events occurring in the framework of a clinical study are to be recorded as AEs (i.e., AEs that 
occur prior to assignment of study treatment that are related to a protocol -mandated intervention, 
including invasive procedures such as biopsies, medication washout, or no treatment r un-in). 
Any clinically significant signs and symptoms; abnormal test findings; changes in physical 
examination; hypersensitivity; and other measurements that occur will be reported as an AE, and 
collected on the relevant eCRF screen.  
Test findings will be reported as an AE if: the test result requires an adjustment in the study 
drug(s) or discontinuation of treatment, and/ or test findings require additional testing or surgical 
intervention, a test result or finding is associated with accompanying symptoms,  or a test result is 
considered to be an AE by the investigator.  
Reporting Period for Adverse Events  
All AEs regardless of seriousness or relationship to  nab-paclitxel and ramucirumab  treatment 
(called study treatment), spanning from the start of study tre atment, until 30 calendar days after 
discontinuation or completion of study treatment as defined by the clinical study for that patient, 
are to be recorded on the corresponding screen(s) included in the eCRF.

FINAL PROTOCOL  DATE :  18 NOVEMBER  2014       VERSION 1.0 
Page 42 of 65 
 All AEs resulting in discontinuation from the  study should be followed until resolution or 
stabilization.  All new AEs occurring during this period must be reported and followed until 
resolution unless, in the opinion of the investigator, the AE or laboratory abnormality/ies are not 
likely to improve  because of the underlying disease.  In this case, the investigators must record 
his or her reasoning for this decision in the patient’s medical record and as a comment on the 
eCRF screen.   
After 30 days of completion of protocol -specific treatment or dis continuation, only AEs, SAEs, 
or deaths assessed by the investigator as treatment related are to be reported.  
11.1.6  Assessment of Adverse Events  
All AEs and SAEs whether volunteered by the patient, discovered by study personnel during 
questioning, or detected th rough physical examination, laboratory test, or other means will be 
reported appropriately.  Each reported AE or SAE will be described by its duration (i.e.,  start and 
end dates), regulatory seriousness criteria if applicable, suspected relationship to the  study drug 
(see following guidance), and actions taken.  
To ensure consistency of AE and SAE causality assessments, investigators should apply the 
following general guideline:  
YES:  There is a plausible temporal relationship between the onset of the AE and  
administration of the study medication, and the AE cannot be readily explained by the 
patient’s clinical state, intercurrent illness, or concomitant therapies, and/or the AE 
follows a known pattern of response to the study drug, and/or the AE abates or re solves 
upon discontinuation of the study drug or dose reduction and, if applicable, reappears 
upon re -challenge.  
NO:  Evidence exists that the AE has an etiology other than the study drug (e.g., pre -
existing medical condition, underlying disease, intercurr ent illness, or concomitant 
medication), and/or the AE has no plausible temporal relationship to study drug 
administration (e.g., cancer diagnosed 2 days after first dose of study drug).  
11.2 Serious Adverse Event Reporting by Investigators  
Adverse events class ified by the treating investigator as serious require expeditious handling and 
reporting to SCRI  Innovations  SD in order to comply with regulatory requirements.  
Determination of life -threatening or serious is based on the opinion of the  study  Investigator .   
Serious AEs may occur at any time from the start of study treatment through the 30 day s after 
their last dose of study drug  follow -up period after the last study treatment.  The SCRI  
Innovations  SD must be notified of all SAEs, regardless of causality,  within 24 hours of the 
first knowledge of the event by the treating physician or research personnel.   
To report a SAE, the SAE Report Form should be completed with the necessary information.  
The SAE report should be sent to SCRI  Innovations  SD via fax or  e-mail using the using the 
following contact information (during both business and non -business hours):  
SCRI  Innovations  Safety Department  
Safety Dept. Fax #:      1 -866-807-4325

Page 43 of 65 
 Safety Dept. Email:     CANN.S AE@ SCRI -Innovations.com  
Transmission of the SAE report should be confirmed by the site personnel submitting the report , 
and a copy of the confirmation should be retained with the patient’s records . 
The initial report must be as complete as possible, inclu ding an assessment of the causal 
relationship between the event and the investigational product(s), if available.  Information not 
available at the time of the initial report (e.g., an end date for the AE or laboratory values 
received after the report) mus t be documented on a follow -up report.  A final report to document 
resolution of the SAE is required . 
Follow -up information for SAEs and information on non -serious AEs that become serious should 
also be reported to SCRI  Innovations  SD as soon as it is avai lable; these reports should be 
submitted using the SCRI  Innovations  SAE Report Form.  T he detailed SAE reporting process 
will be provided to the sites in the SAE reporting guidelines contained in the study reference 
manual.  
Investigators must report SAEs a nd follow -up information to their responsible IRB according to 
the policies of the responsible IRB.  
11.3 Recording of Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
11.3.1  Diagnosis versus Signs and Symptoms  
All AEs should be recorded individually in the patient’s own word s (verbatim) unless, in the 
opinion of the Principal Investigator or designated physician, the AEs constitute components of a 
recognized condition, disease, or syndrome.  In the latter case, the condition, disease, or 
syndrome should be named rather than e ach individual sign or symptom.  If a constellation of 
signs and/or symptoms cannot be medically characterized as a single diagnosis or syndrome at 
the time of reporting, each individual event should be recorded as an AE or SAE as appropriate 
on the releva nt form(s) (SAE Report Form and/or AE eCRF screen).  If a diagnosis is 
subsequently established, it should be reported as follow -up information is available.  If a 
diagnosis is determined subsequent to the reporting of the constellation of symptoms, the 
signs/symptoms should be updated to reflect the diagnosis.  
Progression of malignancy (including fatal outcomes), if documented by use of appropriate 
method (for example, as per RECIST criteria for solid tumors), should not be reported as an 
SAE.  
11.3.2  Persistent o r Recurrent Adverse Events  
A persistent AE is one that extends continuously, without resolution, between patient evaluation 
time points.  Such events should only be recorded once on the SAE Report Form and/or the AE 
eCRF screen.  If a persistent AE becomes  more severe or lessens in severity, it should be 
recorded on a separate SAE Report Form and/or AE eCRF screen.  
A recurrent AE is one that occurs and resolves between patient evaluation time points, and 
subsequently recurs.  All recurrent AEs should be rec orded on an SAE Report Form and/or AE 
eCRF screen.

Page 44 of 65 
 11.3.3  Abnormal Laboratory Values  
If an abnormal laboratory value or vital sign is associated with clinical signs and/or symptoms, 
the sign or symptom should be reported as an AE or SAE, and the associated labora tory value or 
vital sign should be considered additional information that must be collected on the relevant 
eCRF screen.  If the laboratory abnormality is a sign of a disease or syndrome, only the diagnosis 
needs to be recorded on the SAE Report Form or AE  eCRF screen.  
Abnormal laboratory values will be reported as an AE if: the laboratory result requires an 
adjustment in the study drug(s) or discontinuation of treatment, and/ or laboratory findings 
require additional testing or surgical intervention, a lab oratory result or finding is associated with 
accompanying symptoms, or a laboratory result is considered to be an AE by the investigator.  
11.3.4  Deaths  
Deaths that occur during the protocol -specified AE reporting period that are attributed by the 
Investigator sol ely to progression of disease will be recorded on the “Study Discontinuation” 
eCRF screen  and should not be reported as an SAE .  All other on study deaths, regardless of 
attribution, will be recorded on an SAE Report Form and expeditiously reported to the SCRI  
Innovations  SD. 
When recording a SAE with an outcome of death, the event or condition that caused or 
contributed to the fatal outcome should be recorded as the single medical concept on the SAE 
Report Form and Adverse Event screen of the eCRF.  If the  cause of death is unknown and 
cannot be ascertained at the time of reporting, record “Death NOS” on the eCRF Adverse Event 
screen.  During post -study survival follow -up, deaths attributed to progression of disease will be 
recorded only on the “After Progr essive Disease Follow -Up” eCRF screen.  
11.3.5  Hospitalization, Prolonged Hospitalization, or Surgery  
Any AE that results in hospitalization of ≥24 hours or prolongation of pre -existing 
hospitalization should be documented and reported as an SAE unless specificall y instructed 
otherwise in this protocol.  There are some hospitalizations that do not require reporting as an 
SAE.  
Treatment within or admission to the following facilities is not considered to meet the criteria of 
“inpatient hospitalization” (although if any other SAE criteria are met, the event must still be 
treated as an SAE and immediately reported):  
• Emergency Department or Emergency Room  
• Outpatient or same -day surgery units  
• Observation or short -stay unit  
• Rehabilitation facility  
• Hospice or skilled nursi ng facility  
• Nursing homes, Custodial care or Respite care facility

Page 45 of 65 
 Hospitalization during the study for a pre -planned surgical or medical procedure (one which was 
planned prior to entry in the study  and properly documented in the eCRF ), does not require 
reporting as a n SAE to the SCRI  Innovations  SD. 
11.3.6  Pre-Existing Medical Conditions  
A pre -existing medical condition is one that is present at the start of the study.  Such conditions 
should be recorded on the General Medical History eCRF screen.  A pre -existing  medical 
condition should be recorded as an AE or SAE only if the frequency, severity, or character of the 
condition worsens during the study.  When recording such events on an SAE Report Form and/or 
AE eCRF screen, it is important to convey the concept th at the pre -existing condition has 
changed by including applicable descriptors.  
11.3.7  New Cancers  
The development of a new primary cancer should be regarded as an AE and will generally meet 
at least one of the seriousness criteria (see Section  11.1.2 ).  New primary cancers are those that 
are not the primary reason for the administration of the study treatment and have developed after 
the inclusion of the patient into the study.  They do not include metastases of the ori ginal cancer.  
Symptoms of metastasis or the metastasis itself should not be reported as an AE/SAE, as they are 
considered to be disease progression.  
11.3.8  Pregnancy, Abortion, Birth Defects/Congenital Anomalies  
If a patient becomes pregnant while enrolled in th e study, a Pregnancy Form (a paper report 
form, not available within the eCRF) should be completed and faxed to the SCRI  Innovations  
SD.  SCRI  Innovations  SD should be notified immediately , irrespective of whether or not it 
meets the criteria for expedited  reporting.  Abortions (spontaneous, accidental, or therapeutic) 
must also be reported to SCRI  Innovations  SD. 
If a female partner of a male patient becomes pregnant during the male patient’s participation in 
this study, this must be reported to the SCRI  Innovations  SD immediately.  Every effort should 
be made to follow the pregnancy for the final pregnancy outcome.  
Congenital anomalies/birth defects always meet SAE criteria, and should therefore be 
expeditiously reported as an SAE, using the previously des cribed process for SAE reporting.  A 
Pregnancy Form should also have been previously completed, and will need to be updated to 
reflect the outcome of the pregnancy.   All neonatal deaths that occur within 28 days of birth 
should be reported, without regard to causality, as SAEs. In addition, any infant death after 28 
days that the Investigator suspects is related to the in utero exposure to the IP should also be 
reported to Celgene Drug Safety immediately by facsimile, or other appropriate method, within 
24 hours of the Investigator’s knowledge of the event using the SAE Report Form, or approved 
equivalent form.

11.4.1  SCRI Innovations Safety Department  Assessment of Unexpected  
SCRI Innovations  is responsible for as sessing an AE or SAR  as “unexpected .” 
An AE or SAR  is considered “unexpected” when the following conditions occur:  
• Event(s) is not mentioned in the IB (or current US PI) 
• Event(s) is not listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed  
• An event(s ) is not consistent with the General Investigative Plan or in the current 
application  
• Includes AEs or SAR that may be anticipated from the pharmacological properties of the 
study drug, or that occur with members of the drug class, but that have previously been 
observed under investigation  
When applicable, an unexpected AE may also apply to an event that is not listed in the current 
USPI or an event that may be mentioned in the USPI, but differs from the event because of 
greater severity or specificity.    
Known as Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions (SUSAR), these events suspected 
(by the Investigator or Sponsor) to be related to the study drug, are unexpected (not listed in the 
Investigator’s Brochure  [IB] or USPI), and are serious (as defined by  the protocol) and require

regulatory authorities.  
13.3 Informed Consent  
Informed consen t is a process by which a patient voluntarily confirms his or her willingness to 
participate in a particular study  after having been informed of all aspects of the study  that are 
relevant to the patient's decision to participate.  Informed consent is docum ented by means of a 
written, signed, and dated ICF. 
The ICF will be submitted for approval to the IRB that is responsible for review and approval of 
the study .  Each consent form must include all of the relevant elements currently required by the 
FDA, as w ell as local county authority or state regulations and national requirements.  
Before recruitment and enrollment into the study , each prospective candidate will be given a full 
explanation of the research study .  Once the essential information has been prov ided to the 
prospective candidate, and the Investigator is sure that the individual candidate understands the 
implications of participating in this research study , the candidate will be asked to give consent to 
participate in the study  by signing an ICF.  A notation that written informed consent has been 
obtained will be made in the patient’s medical record.  A copy of the ICF, to include the patient’s 
signature, will be provided by the investigator to the patient.  
If an amendment to the protocol substantia lly alters the study  design or the potential risks to the 
patients, the patient’s consent to continue participation in the study  should be obtained.

 13.3.1  Confidentiality  
13.3.1.1  Patient Confidentiality  
Confidentiality of patient’s personal data will be protected in acc ordance with the Health 
Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA),  and national data protection 
laws, as applicable.  HIPAA regulations require that, in order to participate in the study , a patient 
must sign an authorization form for  the study  that he or she has been informed of following:  
• What protected health information (PHI) will be collected from patients in this study  
• Who will have access to that information and why  
• Who will use or disclose that information  
• That health information m ay be further disclosed by the recipients of the information, and 
that if the information is disclosed the information may no longer be protected by federal 
or state privacy laws  
• The information collected about the research study  will be kept separate from  the 
patient’s medical records, but the patient will be able to obtain the research records after 
the conclusion of the study  
• Whether the authorization contains an expiration date  
• The rights of a research patient to revoke his or her authorization  
In the e vent that a patient revokes authorization to collect or use his or her PHI, the investigator, 
by regulation, retains the ability to use all information collected prior to the revocation of patient 
authorization.  For patients that have revoked authorizatio n to collect or use PHI, attempts should 
be made to obtain permission to collect at least vital status (i.e., that the patient is alive) at the 
end of their scheduled study  period.  
In compliance with ICH G ood Clinical Practice  guidelines and applicable par ts of 21 CFR it is a 
requirement that the investigator and institution permit authorized representatives of SCRI 
Innovations , the regulatory authorities and the IRB direct access to review the patient’s original 
medical records at the site for verification  of study -related procedures and data.  
Measures to protect confidentiality include: only a unique study  number and initials will identify 
patients in the eCRF or other documents submitted to SCRI Innovations .  This information, 
together with the patient’s  date of birth, will be used in the database for patient identification.  
Patient names or addresses will not be entered in the eCRF.  No material bearing a patient’s 
name will be kept on file by Sponsor.  Patients will be informed of their rights within t he ICF.  
13.3.1.2  Investigator and Staff Information  
Personal data of the investigators and sub -investigators may be included in the SCRI  Innovations  
database, and shall be treated in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.  When 
archiving or processing  personal data pertaining to the investigator or sub investigator, SCRI  
Innovations  shall take all appropriate measures to safeguard and prevent access to this data by 
any unauthorized party.

 14.4 Data Collection  
The study  eCRF is the primary data collection instrument for the study .  Cas e report forms will 
be completed using the English language and should be kept current to enable SCRI Innovations  
to review the patients’ status throughout the course of the study . 
In order to maintain confidentiality, only study  number, patient number, in itials and date of birth 
will identify the patient in the eCRF.  If the patient’s name appears on any other document (e.g., 
laboratory report), it must be obliterated on the copy of the document to be supplied to SCRI 
Innovations and replaced instead with the patient number and patient’s initials.  The investigator 
will maintain a personal patient identification list (patient numbers with corresponding patient 
identifiers) to enable records to be identified and verified as authentic.  Patient data/informati on 
will be kept confidential, and will be managed according to applicable local, state, and federal 
regulations.  
All data requested in the eCRF must be supported by and be consistent with the patient’s source 
documentation.  All missing data must be explai ned.  When a required laboratory test, 
assessment, or evaluation has not been done or an “Unknown” box is not an option on the eCRF, 
a note should be created verifying that the field was “Not Done” or “Unknown .”  For any entry 
errors made, the error(s) mus t be corrected, and a note explaining the reason for change should 
be provided.  
The investigator will  electronically sign and date the patient eCRF casebook indicating that the 
data in the eCRF has been assessed.  Each completed eCRF will be signed and dat ed by the 
Principal Investigator, once all data for that patient is final.  
14.5 Disclosure and Publication Policy  
All information provided regarding the study , as well as all information collected/documented 
during the course of the study , will be regarded as c onfidential.  SCRI Innovations  reserves the 
right to release literature publications based on the results of the study .  Results from the study  
will be published/presented as per SCRI Innovations  publication process.  
Inclusion of the investigator in the au thorship of any multi center  publication will be based upon 
substantial contribution to the design, analysis, interpretation of data, drafting and/or critically 
revising any manuscript(s) derived from the study .  The investigator acknowledges that the study  
is part of a multi center  study  and agrees that any publication by the investigator of the results of 
the study  conducted at research site shall not be made before the first multi center  publication.  In 
the event there is no multi center  publication within fifteen (15) months after the study  has been 
completed or terminated at all study  sites, and all data has been received, the investigator shall 
have the right to publish its results from the study , subject  to the notice requirements described 
herein and subject  to acknowledgement of the funding partner  as appropriate.  Investigator shall 
provide the funding partner  thirty (30) days to review a manuscript or any poster presentation, 
abstract or other written or oral material which describes the results of th e study  for the purpose 
only of determining if any confidential or patentable information is disclosed thereby.  If the 
funding partner  requests in writing, the investigator shall withhold any publication or 
presentation an additional sixty (60) days solel y to permit the funding partner to seek patent 
protection and to remove any funding partner  Confidential Information from all publications.

 Appendix C: Guidelines for Female Patient s of Child bearing  Potential and Fertile  Male 
Patient s 
 
Acceptable Contraception Methods:    
Women of childbearing potential, defined as all women physiologically ca pable of becoming 
pregnant, must use highly effective contraception during the study and for 3 months  after 
stopping treatment.   
Highly effective contraception is defined as either:  
True Abstinence  When this is in line with the preferred and u sual lifesty le of the subject. 
Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post -
ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acce ptable methods of 
contraception . 
Sterilization   When a woman of childbearing potential has had surgical bilateral 
oophorect omy (with or without hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least 
six weeks prior to study entry .  In case of oophorectomy alone, only 
when the reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by 
follow up hormone level assessment . 
Male Partner Sterilizatio n When  the appropriate post -vasectomy documentation of the 
absence of sperm in the ejaculate . 
Use of a combination of any two of the following ( one from a + one from b): 
a)  Placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system 
(IUS)  or establis hed use of oral, injected or implanted hormonal 
methods of contraception.  
b)  Barrier methods of contraception: Condom or Occlusive cap 
(diaphragm or  cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal 
foam/gel/film/cream/vaginal suppository . 
Fertile m ale patients , defi ned as all males physiologically capable of conceiving offspring, 
with female partners of child -bearing potential must use condoms plus spermicidal agent 
during the study treatment period and for 6 months  after the last dose of study drug, and 
should not f ather a child  during this period . 
Male patients must also refrain from donating sperm  during their participation in the study.  
The following are acceptable forms of barrier contraception:  
• Latex condom, diaphragm or cervical/vault cap when used with spermic idal 
foam/gel/film/cream/suppository  
Unacceptable Contraception Methods:  for women of childbearing potential include:  
• IUD progesterone T  
• Female condom

 • Natural family planning (rhythm method) or breastfeeding  
• Fertility awareness  
• Withdrawal  
• Cervical shield  
Pregnancies  
To ensure subject  safety, each pregnancy in a subject  on study treatment must be reported to 
the SCRI  Innovations  Safety Department within 24 hours of learning of its occurrence.  The 
pregnancy should be followed up for 3 months after the termin ation of the pregnancy to 
determine outcome, including spontaneous or voluntary termination, details of the birth, and 
the presence or absence of any birth defects, congenital abnormalities, or maternal and/or 
newborn complications.  
Pregnancy should be rec orded on a Clinical Study Pregnancy Form and reported by the 
investigator to SCRI  Innovations  Safety Department .  Pregnancy follow -up should be 
recorded on the same form and should include an assessment of the possible relationship to the 
study drug of any  pregnancy outcome.   Any SAE experienced during pregnancy must be 
reported on the SAE Report Form.  
Pregnancy outcomes must be collected for the female partners of any males who took study 
treatment in this study.  Consent to report information regarding th ese pregnancy outcomes 
should be obtained from the mother.  
Women Not of Childbearing Potential are defined as Follows:   
• Women are considered post -menopausal and not of childbearing potential if they have 
had 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea w ith an appropriate clinical profile 
(e.g., age appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms).  
• Women who are permanently sterilized (e.g., tubal occlusion, hysterectomy, bilateral 
salpingectomy, bilateral oophorectomy) .   
• Women who are >45 years -of-age, not using hormone -replacement therapy and who 
have experienced total cessation of menses for at least 12 months  OR who have a 
follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) value >40 mIU/mL and an estradiol value 
<40 pg/mL (140  pmol/L) . 
• Women who are >45 years -of-age, usi ng hormone -replacement therapy and who have 
experienced total cessation of menses for at least 1 year OR who have had documented 
evidence of menopause based on FSH >40 mIU/mL and estradiol <40 pg/mL prior to 
initiation of hormone -replacement therapy .

 Appendix D:  Schedule of Assessments (continued)    
 
a Baseline procedures including medical history, physical examination, 12 -lead ECG, ECOG PS , CBC, CMP plus magnesium and phosphorous , 
PT/PTT /INR, ECG, , and  urine dipstick should be done ≤7 days prio r to initiation of treatment.  However, if these initial examinations are obtained 
within 72 hours of Cycle  1 Day 1 they do not have to be repeated .  A serum or urine pregnancy test  must be performed within 72 hours of Cycle 1 Day 
1. 
b Physical examination will include measurements of height (pretreatment visit only), weight, and vital signs.  
c Vital signs will include resting heart rate, blood pres sure, respiratory rate, and temperature.  
d CMP will include measurements of glucose, BUN, creatinine, sodium, potassium, chloride, calcium, CO2, alkaline phosphatase, A ST (SGOT), ALT 
(SGPT), total bilirubin, total protein, and  albumin plus magnesium  and p hosphorous .  CMP may be done up to 72 hours prior to treatment.     
e If PT /PTT  or INR are normal at baseline , they do not need to be repeated.  Patients requiring the initiation of an anti -coagulation therapy during study 
treatment should have coagulation  tests performed according to standard practice guidelines.  
f Urine dipstick (pH, protein, glucose, blood, ketones, and leukocytes)   
g Serum or urine pregnancy tests are to be conducted in women of childbearing potential.    
h Patients should visit the stu dy center 30 days (+ 3)  for end -of-treatment assessments .  Patients must be followed for AEs for 30 calendar days  after the 
last dose of study drug.  
i CEA tumor marker  will be collected ≤8 weeks  prior to initiation of treatment , every 2 cycles, and at the En d of Study visit . 
j CT scans of the chest ≤ 8 weeks  prior to initiation of treatment , every 2 cycles, and at the End of Study visit if scans were not taken in the previous 8 
weeks . 
k CT scans of the abdomen/pelvis ≤ 8 weeks  prior to initiation of  treatment , every 2 cycles, and at the End of Study visit if scans were not taken in the 
previous 8 weeks .  CT Scans of the abdomen/pelvis is preferred, but CT scans of the abdomen will be accepted for CT scans of the abd omen /pelvis.   
l Patients discontinuing treatm ent for any reason other than PD will be monitored for evidence of disease progression.  Patients will be followed every 3 
months for up to  12 months after the last patient has been enrolled on study for disease progression.    
m Survival will be assessed i n all patients at 6 and 12 months after the last patient has been enrolled on the study.  Patients may be contacted during 
outpatient visits or by telephone.   After 12 months no additional follow -up will be required.

 Appendix E: Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Version 1.1  
Definitions  
Response and progression will be evaluated in this study  using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 
(RECIST) v1.1 (Eisenhauer et al 2009) .  Lesions are either m easurable or non -measurable using the criteria 
provided below.  The term “evaluable” in reference to measurability will not be used, as it does not provide 
additional meaning or accuracy.  
Baseline Eligibility  
Measurable Disease:  Tumor lesions:  Must be acc urately measured in at least one dimension 
(longest diameter in the plane of measurement is to be recorded) with a 
minimum size of:  
• 10 mm by CT by computerized tomography (CT scan slice thickness 
no greater than 5 mm).  
• 10 mm caliper measurement by clinical  exam (lesions that cannot be 
accurately measured with calipers should be recorded as non -
measurable).  
• 20 mm by chest x -ray. 
 
Skin lesions:   Documentation by color photography, including a ruler to 
estimate the size of the lesion, is recommended.  
 
Malignan t lymph nodes:   To be considered pathologically enlarged and  
measurable, a lymph node must be ≥15 mm in short axis when assessed by 
CT scan.  At baseline and in follow -up, only the short axis will be measured 
and followed.  
Non-Measurable Disease:  All other lesions, including small lesions (longest diameter <10 mm or 
pathological lymph nodes with ≥10 - to <15-mm short axis) as well as truly 
non-measurable lesions.  Lesions considered truly non -measurable include: 
leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural or pericardial effusion, inflammatory 
breast disease, lymp hangitic involvement of skin or lung, abdominal masses, 
abdominal organomegaly identified by physical exam that is not measurable 
by reproducible imaging techniques.  
Target Lesions:  The most reproducible measurable lesions, up to a maximum of 2 lesions p er 
organ and 5  lesions in total, representative of all involved organs should be 
identified as target lesions and recorded and measured at baseline.   
Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the 
longest diameter), should be representative of all involved organs, and in 
addition should be those that lend themselves to reproducible repeated 
measurements.  Pathological nodes which are defined as measurable and that 
may be identified as target lesions must meet the criterion o r a short axis of 
≥15 mm by CT scan.  
A sum of the diameters (longest for non -nodal lesions, short axis for nodal 
lesions) for all target lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline 
sum diameters. If lymph nodes are to be included in the sum, th en as noted 
above, only the short axis is added into the sum.  The baseline sum diameters 
will be used as reference to further characterize any objective tumor 
response.  
Non-Target Lesions:  All other lesions should be identified as non -target lesions at b aseline.  
Measurements of these lesions are not required, but the presence or 
absence of each should be noted throughout follow -up.

 Guidelines for Evaluation of Measureable Disease  
All measurements should be taken and recorded in metric notation, using a ruler or calipers.  All baseline 
evaluations should be performed as closely as possible to the beginning of treatment, as per protocol screening 
requirements.  
The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize each identifi ed and reported 
lesion at baseline and during follow -up.  Imaging -based evaluation is preferred to evaluation by clinical examination 
when both methods have been used to assess the anti -tumor effect of a treatment.  
 
Clinical Lesions:  Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are superficial 
(e.g., skin nodules and palpable lymph nodes) and ≥10 mm in diameter.  In 
the case of skin lesions, documentation by color photography, including a 
ruler to estimate the size of the lesion, is recomme nded.  
Chest X -ray: Lesions on chest X -ray are acceptable as measurable lesions when they are 
clearly defined and surrounded by aerated lung.  However, a CT scan is 
preferable.  
Conventional CT and MRI:  CT, MRI:  CT is the best currently available and repr oducible method to 
measure lesions selected for response assessment.  This guideline has 
defined measurability of lesions on CT scan based on the assumption that CT 
slice thickness is 5mm or less.  When CT scans have slice thickness greater 
than 5  mm, the minimum size for a measurable lesion should be twice the 
slice thickness.  MRI is also acceptable in certain situations (e.g. for body 
scans).  
Ultrasound:  When the primary study  endpoint is objective response, ultrasound should 
not be used to measure tum or lesions.  It is, however, a possible alternative 
to clinical measurements of superficial palpable lymph nodes, subcutaneous 
lesions, and thyroid nodules.  Ultrasound may also be useful to confirm the 
complete disappearance of superficial lesions usually  assessed by clinical 
examination.  
Endoscopy and Laparoscopy:  Use of endoscopy and laparoscopy for objective tumor evaluation has not yet 
been fully and widely validated.  Therefore, use of these techniques for 
objective tumor response should be restricte d to validation purposes in 
specialized centers.  Such techniques can be useful in confirming complete 
pathological response when biopsies are obtained.  
Tumor Markers:  Tumor markers alone cannot be used to assess response.  If markers are 
initially above the upper limit of normal, they must normalize for a subject to 
be considered in complete clinical response when all lesions have 
disappeared.  
Cytology and Histology:  Cytology and histology can be used to differentiate between partial response 
(PR) and co mplete response (CR) in rare cases (e.g., after treatment to 
differentiate between residual benign lesions and residual malignant lesions 
in tumor types such as germ cell tumors).

 Response Criteria  
Evaluation of Target Lesions  
Complete Response (CR):  Disappearance of all target lesions.   
Partial Response (PR):  
 At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target  
lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters . 
Stable Disease (SD):   
 Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor su fficient increase to 
qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest (nadir) sum of diameters 
since the treatment started.  
Progressive Disease (PD):   
 At least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking 
as reference the smalles t (nadir) sum since the treatment started, or the 
appearance of one or more new lesions.  Requires not only 20% increase, but 
absolute increase of a minimum of 5  mm over sum.  
 
Evaluation of Non -Target Lesions  
Complete Response (CR):  Disappearance of all n on-target lesions and normalization of tumor markers.  
All lymph nodes must be non -pathological in size ( <<10 mm short axis).  
Stable Disease (SD):    
 Persistence of one or more non -target lesions and/or persistence of tumor 
marker level above the normal limits.  
Progressive Disease (PD):  
 Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of 
existing non -target lesions.  When the subject also has measurable disease, to 
achieve “unequivocal progression” on the basis of the non -target dis ease, 
there must be an overall level of substantial worsening in non -target disease 
such that, even in presence of SD or PR in the target disease, the overall 
tumor burden has increased sufficiently to merit discontinuation of therapy.  
 
Evaluation of Best  Overall Response  
As detailed above, the best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the treatment until disease 
progression/recurrence (taking as reference for PD the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started).  
In general, the subject’s best response assignment will depend on the achievement of both measurement and 
confirmation criteria.   
Confirmation of response (by repeat scans after 4 weeks or as specified in the protocol) is required for studies in 
which res ponse rate is the primary endpoint, but is not required in randomized studies  or studies  with primary 
survival endpoints (i.e., where response is not a primary endpoint).

In some circumstances, it may be difficult to distinguish residual disease from normal tissue.  When the evaluation 
of a CR depends upon thi s determination, it is recommended that the residual lesion be investigated by fine needle 
aspirate or biopsy to confirm the CR status.  
When nodal disease is included in the sum of target lesions, and the nodes decrease to “normal” size ( <10 mm), they 
may still have a measurement reported on scans.  This measurement should be recorded even though the nodes are 
normal in order not to overstate progression, should it be based on increase in size of the nodes.  As noted earlier, 
this means that subjects with CR may not have a total sum of “zero” on the eCRF.

 PROTOCOL SUMMARY 
Study Title  
SAFETY  OF URATE ELEVATION IN ALS  – PHASE II (SURE -ALS2)  
 
Version Number  
3.0 
 Study Indication  
Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS)  
 
Phase of Development  
2  
Rationale for the Study  
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal, neurodegenerative disease for which there is no cure.  Multiple lines of evidence have implicated oxidative stress in the pathophysiology of AL S.  Urate 
(uric acid) is an endogenous antioxidant system, and urate may serve as a major defense against 
oxidative stress.   Urate has emerged as a promising neuro -protectant and therapeutic target based on 
convergent epidemiological, laboratory, and clini cal data in multiple neurodegenerative diseases, 
most notably Parkinson’s disease (PD).  In PD, urate elevation has been pursued as a potential 
therapy by administration of inosine, a urate precursor  that is available as an over -the-counter 
supplement .  Administration of inosine results in a predictable elevation of urate levels and has been 
shown to be safe and well tolerated in PD.   
 
Analysis of ALS databases revealed that higher urate levels are an independent predictor of slower 
progression and prolong ed survival in ALS.  However, whether elevati ng urate in people with ALS 
would result in better  outcomes  is unknown.   
 We have recently concluded a Pilot Study of Inosine in ALS, which was a short, open label , single 
center st udy involving 25 subjects . The study showed  safety and feasibility of urate elevation in 
patients with ALS. We are now pursuing a multi -center  Phase II trial to confirm these findings with 
longer exposure time.   
Study Design  
This is a multi- center, 20 -week study of inosine treatment.  
  
Inosine in ALS  
V3.0  7/01/2019  
Page 9 of 75 
 Study Objectives and Endpoints  
The primary objective of the study is to determine the safety and tolerability of oral administration  of 
inosine  (administered daily ) dosed to moderately elevate serum urate over 20 weeks .  
 
The primary outcome measure s will be  
1- safety, as measured by adverse events  
2- tolerability, defined as the ability of subjects to complete the entire 20- week study.  
 As an exploratory objective , we will test the feasibility  and utility of a smartphone application for 
monitoring symptoms and disease progression in patients with ALS.  
 
Study Location  
Up to Three (3) Northeast ALS Consortium (NEALS) Centers in the United States  
 
Number of Planned Subjects  
It is expected that approximately 60 subjects will be  consented  and 30 subjects will be  treated in the 
study.  
 
Study Population  
This study will be conducted in subjects who meet the El Escorial criteria of possible, laboratory -
supported probable, probable, or definite criteria for a diagnosis of ALS .  At screening, eligible 
subjects must be at least 18 years old and must provide written inform ed consent prior to screening. 
Subjects on a stable dose of riluzole and those not taking riluzole, and women of child -bearing age at 
screening are eligible for inclusion as long as they meet specific pr otocol requirements.  Detailed 
criteria are described in the body of the pr otocol.  
 
Treatment Plan  
Subjects will be administered oral inosine daily.  The dose of inosine will be titrated to obtain serum urate levels of 7 - 8 mg/dL.   
 
Duration of Treatment  and Follow -up 
Subjects will remain on treatment until the Week 20 visit.  Each subject will also have a Week 
24 Follow -up Telephone Interview to assess for adverse events (AEs), changes in concomitant 
medications and to administer the ALSFRS -R.

 2 INTRODUCTION: BACKGROUND INFORMATI ON AND SCIENTIFIC 
RATIONALE  
2.1 Back ground Information  
2.1.1 Clinical Features and Epidemiology of ALS  
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a rare degenerative disorder of large motor neurons of the 
cerebral cortex, brain stem and spinal cord that results in progressive wasting and paralysis of 
voluntary muscle s1. The incidence of ALS is currently approximately 2/100,00 02. The lifetime ALS 
risk is 1 in 600 to 1 in 10002. Even though the inci dence of ALS is similar t o that of multiple 
sclerosis , the prevalence is only 4 - 6/100,000 (about 25,000- 30,000 subjects in the United States),  
due to the higher mortality rate. Fifty per -cent of ALS cases die within three years of onset of 
symptoms and 90% die within five years3. The median age of onset is  55 years3. The cause in most 
cases is unknown4. Age and male gender are the only risk factors repeatedly documente d in 
epidemiological studies . No trea tment prevents, halts or revers es the disease, although the use of 
riluzole (the only FDA -approved therapy for ALS) is associated with a slight prolongation of 
survival5. 
2.1.2 Role of oxidative stress in  ALS Pathogenesis  
Despite decades of focused research, a unifying and well -tested theory of ALS disease 
pathophysiology remains enigmati c4. At the same time, the body of knowledge has expanded 
dramatically as research tools have improved. Research increasingly implicates oxidative stress as 
one of t he major molecular mechanisms leading to neuronal death in ALS6.  
 
Oxidative stress has been implicated in the pathophysiology of ALS since the discovery that 
mutations in an antioxidant system, the copper/zinc superoxide dismutase (Cu/Zn SOD, SOD1)  
gene, are associated with 20% of cases of familial ALS7, 8.  Identification of SOD1 as the first gene 
linked to ALS pathophysiology has enabled the development of animal models from which much of our understanding of the mechanisms of neurodegeneration in ALS has emerged.  These  studies have 
shown that the neurodegenerative processes involved in this disease are diverse and complex 
including not only oxidative stress, but also excitotoxicity, mitochondrial dysfunction, defects in 
RNA processing, inflammation, protein aggregation, disruption of neurofilaments and intracellular 
trafficking along microtubules, as well as involvement of non- neuronal cells in the vicinity of motor 
neurons
8, 9.  Nevertheless, oxidative stress, whether as a primary cause of disease or a secondary 
consequence, has been implicated in many of these processes and appears as a central mechanism by which motor neuron death occurs
7.

Despite the compelling evidence supporting a pathogenic role of oxidative stress in ALS, the agents 
with antioxidant properties studied to date (such as CoQ10 and Vitamin E)10, 11 in randomized 
placebo -controlled clinical trials have failed to show benefits on disease progression.  This 
observation highlights the fact that it is important to include assessment of measures of target 
engagement in the study design of pilot, proof -of-concept studies of candidate compounds in order to 
demonstrate the intended biological effect in early studies prior to proceeding along the drug 
development process. 
2.2 Rationale for choosing inosine for  ALS  
Inosine is an intermediary metabolite of pur ine metabolism, is available as 
an over-the-counter oral supplement. Inosine  is converted into urate , the 
anionic form of uric acid (Fig. 1) .  
 
Urate may be o ne of our major endogenous defenses against oxidative 
stress.   As an apparent consequence of mult iple independent mutations in 
the urate oxidase gene ( UOx ) during primate evolution12-14, urate 
circulates at high concentrations near the limits of its solubility 
(accounting for our susceptibility to gout) and constitutes the end product 
in the metabolism of purines in humans and apes (Fig. 1).  The 
demonstration that urate possesses antioxidant properties comparable to 
those of ascorbate13, 15 and accounts for most of the antioxidant capacity in 
human plasma16, 17, supports the hypothesis that our ancestors gained 
antioxidant benefits from UOx  mutations and the resulting urate 
elevatio n18, 19.  
 
Interestingly, urate has been gaining momentum as a  promising agent for neuroprotection based on 
rapidly accumulating epidemiological observations, laboratory data, and early clinical trial results in 
multiple neurologic diseases, most notably Parkinson disease (PD)20, 21.  These lines of evidence  
(summarized below) demonstrate the potential therapeutic s ignificance of unraveling the molecular 
mechanisms of urate actions in the CNS and have already prompted clinical development of urate -
elevating strategies for PD21 and stroke22.

 2.2.1  Urate as neuroprotective agent: epidemiological evidence 
 
Urate is a strong molecular predictor for both reduced risk and 
favorable progression in PD.  A meta -analysis of prospective 
epidemiological data on urate and PD risk suggested a 20% 
reduction in the pooled rate ratio of PD for each 1.3 mg/dL 
increase in blood urate concentration23.  Further, PD disability 
progressed more slowly among early PD patients with higher 
urate levels at baseline (Fig.  2).  In the PRECEPT clinical 
trial, the risk of PD disability progressing to the need for 
dopaminergic therapy among those in the highest quintile of 
serum urate concentration was half that of the lowest quintile
24.  Similarly, in the DATATOP clinical trial, risk of 
PD progression was reduced by 18% for each 1.5 mg/dL increase in serum urate concentration with a similar inverse correlation between cerebrosp inal fluid (CSF) urate and 
progression
25.   
 
Further epidemiological support to a potential pathogenic 
association between urate and PD is provided by studies showing that both dietary and genetic factors that affect urate 
levels modify susceptibility to PD. Thus, a higher dietary urate 
index was associated with a lower risk of PD (top quintile vs. 
bottom: relative risk = 0.47, p- trend = 0.0008), after 
adjustment  for potential confounders
26 and g enetic variability in nine genes known to influence urate 
levels was found to be associated with PD risk27.  Higher urate levels have also been correlated with 
slower clinical progression in Huntington’s disease, multiple system atrophy, and mild cognitive 
impairment28-30 raising the hypothesis of a broad neuroprotective effect of urate in multiple CNS 
neuronal populations.   
 
Based on this convergence of data linking higher urate levels w ith improved outcomes in multiple 
neurodegenerative diseases, we examined ALS clinical trial data and found that urate levels are an 
independent predictor of progression and survival in ALS, where higher levels are associated with improved outcomes
31 (Figure 3) . In a clinical trial database study of 251 ALS subjects, we found a 
39% reduction in risk of death during the study for men, but not women, with each 1 mg/ dL increase 
in urate levels31.

favorable clinical progression in early PD.  Risk 
of progression is defined as *the hazard ratio of

therapy among 1,578 de novo PD subjects of the 
DATATOP and PRECEPT clinical trial cohorts.  Values

serum urate measured at baseline, and are relative to 
the lowest quintile.  Data are pooled (unpublished data, 
Schwarzschild MA et al .) form our prior publications on 
PRECEPT and DATATOP cohorts. The 1st, 3rd and 5th 
quintiles correspond to serum urate values of <4.1, 4.9-
5.5 and>6.4 mg/dL, respectively.

Similar results were reported by other groups32-34 and were confirmed and expanded by our recent 
analysis of individuals from PRO -ACT , the largest available ALS clinical trial dataset (Pooled 
Resource Open -Access ALS Clinical Trials database)35.  In PRO -ACT,  urate levels at trial entry 
were available for almost 1,800 individuals and were found to be one of the strong est predictors of 
disease progression and survival35.  Thus, higher levels of ura te at trial entry were predictive of a 
slower drop in ALS functional rating scale -revised [ALSFRS -R (p=0.01)] and vital capacity [VC 
(p<0.0001)], and longer survival (p=0.02) in both men and women (35 and Paganoni et al., 
unpublished data).  
2.2.2 Urate as neuroprotective agent: b iological  evidence  
 
Pre-clinical evidence from multiple  labs further supports urate as a neuroprotective agent. 
   
In vitro , across a range of PD models, urate has prevented spontaneous degeneration of cultured 
nigral neurons as well as dopaminergic cell death induced by oxidative and mitochondrial toxins36-45. 
Urate protected dopaminergic neurons in cellular models of PD36-38. Interest ingly, urate -mediated 
effects required its accumulation in astrocytes, suggesting a non cell -autonomous mechanism for 
urate’s activity38, 39.  Urate confers protection in various cellular models of neurotoxicity beyond that 
of PD.  Urate protected cultured spinal cord neurons from glutamate toxicity39 and from 
peroxynitrite -mediated death40 in models of spinal cord injury and stroke40, 41.

Page 18 of 75 
 Recently, the Schwarzschild lab  has also  characterized the effect of urate manipulation in vivo in 
animal models of PD.  In mice, administration of urate or a urate precursor does not l ead to 
appreciable increase in urate CNS concentration as urate is metabolized peripherally by  the enzyme 
urate oxidase (UOx).  Therefore, mice with a knockout (KO) of the UOx  gene (effectively were 
employed. These mice have increased concentrations of urat e in the central nervous system (CNS)36. 
Effects of UOx  manipulation were then assessed in a model of hemiparkinsonism induced by 
unilateral intrastriatal injection o f 6-hydroxydopamine (6- OHDA) (Fig. 4 ).   
 
UOx  KO mice exhibited attenuated neurotoxic effects of 6 -OHDA on nigral dopaminergic cell 
counts (Fig. 4 ), striatal dopamine content and rotational behavior36.  These results strengthened the 
evidence supporting a neuroprotective role of endogenous urate in neurodegeneration .   
2.2.3 Urate as neuroprotective agent: early clinical trial evidence  
 
Indeed, based on the strong pre -clinical evidence of a neuroprotective role for urate in the CNS, 
recent clinical trials have begun to examine the feasibility of urate manipulation in a clinical setting 
with promising results21, 22.   
 The Safety of Urate Elevation in Parkinson Disease (SURE -PD) trial, a phase II randomized, double -
blind, placebo- controlled, dose -ranging trial of oral in osine in PD
21 recently  demonstrated that 
inosine supplementation leads to a dose -dependent increase in blood and CSF urate levels  in patients 
with PD. Inosi ne is available as an over -the-counter supplement. Although the study was not 
powered to test efficacy, secondary analyses demonstrated non -futility of inosine treatment for 
slowing disability21.  Encouraging clinical results were also recently obtained by the Safety and 
Efficacy of Uric Acid in Patients with Acute Stroke (URICO -ICTUS) study: a randomized, double -
blind trial of intravenous urate administratio n within a few hours of stroke onset22.   
 A follow -up. NIH -funded, Phase 3 study of inosine in PD (SURE -PD3) is currently ongoing).  Figure 4. Evidence for neuroprote ctive effects 
of urate in an animal model of PD.   
UOx  KO mice (bottom panels), which have

panel).

While urate is a mature tar get in PD and experience on inosine pharmacology is rapidly 
accumulating, urate manipulation is a new target for ALS.  With this Phase 2 study, we seek to 
confirm the safety of inosine when administered to people with ALS as well as gather data on target 
engagement as measured by neuro imaging biomarkers.  
2.2.4 Biomarkers of oxidative stress and damage  
 Oxidative stress arises from an imbalance between the production of oxidizing agents (such as 
reactive oxygen species, ROS) and the ability of the system to  remove the damage they cause and to 
restore the prevailing reducing environment.  Most ROS arise as by -products of aerobic metabolism 
and central nervous system (CNS) neurons are known to be especially susceptible to oxidative 
damage
42.  Oxidative stress and the capacity to manage it can be tested in several ways, ranging from 
direct measurement of the ROS; measurement of the resulting oxidative damage to biomolecules (such as nucleic acids, proteins or lipids); and detection of antioxidant levels  (e.g., by measuring a 
composite index such as ferric reducing antioxidant power [FRAP], or individual antioxidants such as urate, ascorbate or glutathione).  Elevated levels of m arkers of oxidative damage to different 
biomolecules have been repeatedly demonstrated in postmortem tissue and/or the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from ALS patients
1, including elevated protein carbonyl levels , a marker of oxidized 
proteins43, and increased 3 -nitrotyrosine levels, a marker for nitrosative damage44 resulting from 
reactive nitrogen species comparable to ROS.  As demonstrated by Dr. Cudkowicz and colleagues at MGH elevated levels of 8 -hydroxy -2′-deoxyguanosine (8- OHdG), a well -established marker of 
oxidized DNA, cor related with disease progression, 
suggesting it may represent a biomarker of disease 
severity
45.  Among antioxidant systems, FRAP and 
urate were found to be lower in ALS subjects 
compared to controls34, 46, 47.   
 More recently, MRS has enabled the measurement of various metabolites in vivo  and has been utilized 
to show that the levels of glutathione are reduced in 
the motor cortex of ALS patients by about 30%
48. 
Altogether, these results suggest that antioxidant 
capacity is reduced in ALS.  
 The mechanisms of urate -based neuroprotection are 
not completely clear. However, recent evidence from the Schwarzschild lab
38  and other labs49 suggests a role for nuclear factor erythroid 2–related factor 
2 (Nrf2) signaling pathway in urate -mediated neuroprotection.  In primary astrocytic cultures, urate 

 
Inosine in ALS  
V3.0  7/01/2019  
Page 20 of 75 
 treatment induced expression of key Nrf2 target genes50 including expression of the first enzyme of 
the glutathione ( GSH)  biosynthetic pathway.  Consistent ly, urate treatment resulted in up -regulation 
of GSH synthesis and release (Fig. 5).   
 
Further, r esults from the SURE -PD trial demonstrated that 
inosine supplementation leads to increased plasma antioxidant capacity as measured by FRAP (Fig. 6). These 
findings provide evidence of an intended biological effect 
of potential therapeutic relevance and suggest that 
homeostatic mechanisms do not counteract the plasma 
antioxidant effects of urate elevation.   
2.3 Inosine   
Elevation of urate levels in humans cannot be achieved by 
oral administra tion of urate, possibly due to its degra dation by the activity of uricase expressed by 
the intestinal flora before reaching the circulation
51. On the other hand, predictable elevation of urate 
levels can be obtained by administration of the urate precursor inosine.  
 
Inosine (chemical name: hypoxanthine 9 -β-D-ribofuranoside)  is an intermediary metabolite of purine 
metabolism (see Fig . 1). Inosine is available as an over -the-counter supplement for oral use.  
2.3.1 Potential Risks and Benefits  
 
Inosine’s reputation as an athletic performance enhancer has led to its widespread marketing and use as a nutritional supplement. Potential side  effects of inosine relate to the resulting ele vated urate 
(uric acid) levels (hyperuricemia) . Hyperuricemia has  been linked to gout. Gout generally develops 
in people with serum urate concentrations above 8 mg/dL (the upper limit of the normal range). Hyperuricemia has also been linked  to the formation of urate stones in the kidneys or ureters 
(urolithiasis). Urate urolithiasis account for 5 to 10 percent of urinary tract stones in the United 
States and Europe. In most urate stone formers the primary pathophysiologic defect , however, is an 
excessively acidic urine pH rather than hyperuricemia  and hyperuricosuria
52. High urate levels have 
also been associated with high bl ood pressure and increased risk for cardiovascular events.  
However, whether a causal relationship between high urate and cardiovascular disease exists is 
unclear53.   
 Considerable non- clinical human experience on inosine has been gai ned from the widespread use of 
inosine as a nutritional supplement and a purported (but unsubstantiated) athletic performance 

 
Inosine in ALS  
V3.0  7/01/2019  
Page 21 of 75 
 enhancer. Although inosine use has been generally considered safe in these contexts, exposures are 
variable in size and poorly doc umented.  
 
Three exercise physiology studies of oral inosine on athletic performance in humans have been published
54-56. All three reported that multi- gram do ses (up to 10 gm/day) were well tolerated short -
term (up to 10 days), but had no demonstrable benefit on athletic performance.  
 Of relevance to the proposed study, multi- year clinical trials of oral inosine in multiple sclerosis 
(MS) and Parkinson’s diseas e (PD) at doses comparable to those planned here  have been conducted. 
In these studies , inosine at  doses sufficient to chronically elevate urate into the ranges targeted here 
was well tolerated,  with the most consistent AE being the rare development of uri c acid  urolithiasis.  
 
The MS literature includes 4 peer -reviewed  published studies on the use of inosine
51, 57-59. Inosine 
has been administered in this population for prolonged periods ( up to 1 year ) at up to 3 gm/day 
(divided into 2 or 3 doses daily ). 
 
In the study by Spitsin et al.51, 11 subjects with advanced MS received increasing doses  of inosine  
from 1 to 3 g m/day. U rate levels in blood were monitored every 2 weeks  and the daily inosine dose  
was increased every other week until serum urate levels reached approximately 8 mg/dl. Thereafter,  
each patient received a daily dose of inosine sufficient to maintain serum urate levels within a  range 
of 7 ± 9 mg/dL  for up to a year . No patients experienced symptomatic  hyperuricemia or gouty 
arthritis, and no urate crystals  or other abnormalities were reported in urine.  
 
Gonsette et al57 performed a placebo -controlled trial of  inosine in MS. Seventy -nine subjects with 
MS received inosine for 24 months. The treatment regimen consisted of 1 g m of inosine 
administered three times a day  (initial total daily dose 3 g m daily) . Inosine dose was then adapted by 
the treating neurologist after 1 month and then every 3 months to keep serum urate levels lower than 
9 mg/dl in women and lower than 10 mg/dl in men. Particular attention was  paid to side effects 
possibly related to a chronic, asymptomatic  hyperuric emia. T here were no  reports of gout, stroke, or 
coronary heart disease.  Symptoms of renal or ureteral stones were reported in  three cases in the 
experimental group (3.8%) and one case in the placebo  group (1.3%). Spontaneous elimination 
occurred in three cases and one patient had lithot ripsy.  Of note, in this study  there were no efforts to 
reduce the risk  of stone formation through screening of low urine pH, a major risk factor in the  
formation of urate urolithiasis52. In addition, subjects with baseline urate up to 7 mg/dL were 
allowed into the study with target urate levels up to 9 -10 mg/dL ( both entry cut -off and target urate 
levels in the MS study were higher than in the planned study for ALS).  
 Spitsin , Markowitz and colleagues
58, 59 administered inosine to a group of 16 subjects with MS for 
one year. The goal of the study was to investigate the effect of chronically elevated urate levels on 
 
Inosine in ALS

 blood pressure  as well as collect MS -related inflammatory and imaging biomarkers . The inosine 
dosage was initiated at 1 –2 gm per day, and increased by 0.5 g per day at biweekly  intervals until the 
target serum UA levels of 6 –9 mg/dL were achieved. For most patients the inosine  dose required to 
maintain target UA levels was  between 2 and 3 g per day.  Inosine treatment did not affect bloo d 
pressure over a one -year period58. Four subjects (25%) developed kidney stones  which were treated 
with conservative measures including termination of inosine a dministration, improved hydration, 
and pain medication. Exceptionally high serum urate  levels  were recorded for at least two of these 
subjects (10–15 mg/dL)58. In all patients in whom inosine treatment was stopped, serum UA levels 
returned to pretrial levels within 3 –5 days and no re -occurrence of kidney stones was reported. This 
included a subject who resumed inosine treatment 2 months after developing a kidney s tone59. In 1 
patient who developed kidney stones, an ultrasound scan revealed the presence of kidney cancer in 
the other kidney, which was successfully treated surgically59. Similar to the study by Gonsette et 
al.57, this study did not exclude subjects with  acidic urine at baseline52.  
 
In the recent SURE -PD trial21, a total of 75 subjects with Parkinson’s Disease (mean age, 62 years; 
55% women) were randomized to either placebo  or inosine titrated to produce mild (6.1- 7 mg/dL) or 
moderate (7.1- 8 mg/dL) serum ur ate elevation and were followed for up to 24 months. Individuals at 
greatest risk of known effects of increased urate (i .e., those  with a history  of gout or urolithiasis, or 
with urine  pH ≤5.0, a  major risk factor for uric acid  urolithiasis) were excluded from enrolling . 
Treatment was initiated gradually with 1 capsule (500 mg of inosine per capsule) taken 2 times daily 
for 2 weeks. After the 2-  and 4- week visits, participants received up to 2 capsules 2 to 3 times daily, 
as algorithmically determined by serum urate concentration and treatment group assignment. Target 
urate levels were achieved between 2 and 4 weeks after initiation of inosine treatment21. Serious 
adverse events (17), including infrequent cardiovascular events, occurred at  the same or lower rates 
in the inosine groups relative to placebo. No participant developed gout and 3 receiving inosine 
developed symptomatic nephrolithiasis (6%); two were determined to be calcium oxalate stones and  
one was believed to be a uric acid stone . Despite the increased frequency of nephrolithiasis while 
receiving inosine, there were no other re nal SAEs and renal function measures of glomerular 
filtration rate and serum creatinine remained unchanged from baseline in all groups. S erial vital 
signs, serum assays, and electrocar diograms showed no effect  of inosine  on blood pressure , body 
mass index , serum  glucose and cholesterol levels or electrocardiographic parameters . Treatment was 
tolerated by  95% of participants at 6 months, and no participant withdrew because of an adverse 
event.  Serum urate rose by 2.3 and 3.0 mg/dL in the 2 inosine groups ( P < .001 for each) vs . placebo,  
and cerebrospinal fluid urate level was greater in both inosine groups ( P = .006 and <.001, 
respectively). Secondary analyses demonstrated non- futility of inosine treatment for slowing 
disability.  
 
The Phase II I SURE -PD3 tria l is ongoing  and the goal is  to enroll 270 subjects with Parkinson’s 
Disease by December 2017.

 2.3.2 SAFETY SUMMARY  
 Inosine is available over -the-counter as an athletic performance enhancer. Considerable non- clinical 
human experience on inosine has bee n gained from its widespread use as a nutritional supplement. In 
this context, inosine has been considered safe, although exposures are variable in size and poorly 
documented. 
 
 
Potential side effects of inosine relate to the resulting elevated urate (uric  acid) levels 
(hyperuricemia). Hyperuricemia has been linked to gout (which generally develops in people with 
serum urate concentrations above 8 mg/dL) and to the formation of urate stones in the kidneys or 
ureters (urolithiasis). In most ur ic acid  stone f ormers the primary pathophysiologic defect, however, 
is an excessively acidic urine pH rather than hyperuricemia52. High urate levels have also been 
associated with high blood pressure and increased risk for cardiovascular events.  However, whether 
a causal relationship between high urate and cardiovascular disease exists is unclear53.   
 The safety profile of chronic inosine administration in a huma n clinical research setting has been 
well characterized  by research studies in M S
51, 57-59 and PD21. At doses comparable (or higher) to 
those planned here, inosine was well tolerated up to 2 years. T he most consistent AE was  the 
development of uric acid urolithi asis. In the PD  study21, where people with acidic urine were 
excluded  and target urate levels did not exceed 8 mg/dL (as planned here) , the prevalence of 
urolithias is was 6%. There were no reports of gout and no excess cardiovascular events relative to 
placebo in any of these studies.

 4 STUDY DESIGN 
4.1 Overall Study Design and Plan 
During the enrollment period, approximately 60 subjects will be screened at up to three (3) Northeast 
ALS Consortium (NEALS) Centers in the United States.   Approximately  30 of these subjects are 
expected to be found eligible for study enrollment and will be randomized 2:1 to receive inosine  or 
placebo.  Per study protocol , the aim is to elevated serum urate levels only in those  subjects whose 
baseline urate level falls below the predicted median for this population.  Approximately  30 subjects 
will receive inosine or placebo for 20 weeks (administered in the form of 500 mg capsules, 1 to 6 
capsules a day for a total daily dose of up to 3 gm) .  The dose of inosine will be titrated to target 
urate levels of 7 -8 mg/dL based on urate level measurement that will occur at the Week 3, Week 6, 
Week  9, Week 12 and Week  16 visits . Clinic visits will occur at S creening, Baseline, Week 12, 
Week 20 and Unscheduled Safety Visits . Telephone visits and remote serum urate testing will occur 
at Week 3, Week 6, Week 9 and Week 16. There will be a window of ±  3 days for each visit . The 
Screening Visit  must be completed within 21 days of the Baseline Visit.  All visit windows are 
consecutive calendar days and are calculated from the day the participant starts study treatment  (Day 
0, the day of the Baseline Visit).  
4.2 Study Centers  
This study will be conducted a s a multi- center study at up to three (3) Northeast ALS Consortium 
(NEALS) Centers in the United States . 
4.3 Study Duration  
Subjects will remain on treatment until the Week 20 visit.  Each subject will also have a Week 24 
Follow-up Telephone Interview to assess for adverse events (AEs), changes in concomitant 
medications and to administer the ALSFRS -R. 
4.4 Protocol Adherence  
The Site Investigator s agree to adhere to the protocol detailed in this document and agree that any 
changes to the protocol must be approved by the site Institutional Review Board (IRB).   The Site  
Investigator (SI) will be responsible for enrolling only those study subjects who have met protocol eligibility crite ria.

 5 SELECTION  AND WITHDRAWAL  OF STUDY POP ULATION 
5.1 Number of Study Subjects  
Approximately  60 subjects will be consented for the study . Any subject who signs consent will be 
considered enrolled in the study. Screening study procedures will begin after informed consent.  
 
We expect a 50% screen fail rate based on our goal of elevating serum urate levels only in those 
subjects whose serum urate level falls below the population median. T his subpopulation is at greater 
risk of faster disease progression and can also accommodate an increase in serum ur ate to higher, but 
still normal levels, which are known to be associated with slower disease progression21, 31, 35.  
 
Thirty  (30) subjects will receive inosine  or placebo  for 20 weeks per study protocol and will be 
followed up to Week 24.  
 
If a subject fails screening, at a min imum, the followi ng information will be captured and entered in 
the data capture system: inclusion/exclusion criteria, demographics, screening lab results, reason for screen failure.  
5.2 Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria  
5.2.1 Inclusion Criteria

Participation in other investigationa l trials for the treatment of patients with ALS is allowed.  
5.3 Withdrawal  
Study drug  will be discontinued if: 
• Any clinical adverse event (AE ), laboratory abnormality, con current illness, or other medical 
condition or situation occurs such that continued participation in the study would not be in 
the best interest of the subject.  
 
Subjects are free to withdraw from participation in the study at any time upon request . 
 
Subjects who withdraw from the study will not be replaced.  
5.3.1 Handling of Withdrawals  
A subject may choose to discontinue participation in the study at any time.  However, the Site 
Investigator or designee will encourage subjects to continue with follow -up, regardless of their 
compliance with study drug. If a subject who initiated study drug  permanently discontinues study 
drug, the SI or designee should still encourage subjects to follow the study protocol under the 
 
Inosine in ALS  
V3.0  7/01/2019  
Page 28 of 75 
 modified intent -to-treat principle (ITT). These subjects will be encouraged to follow the study visits, 
off drug, up to the fina l visit. Loss to follow -up should be prevented whenever possible.  
 
Any subject who is on study drug and needs to begin the use of any prohibited medication, must immediately discontinue use of study drug.  Subjects who permanently discontinue study drug 
should return any unused study drug and complete early study drug discontinuation procedures per 
protocol. 
 
If a subject wishes to withdraw consent, i.e., withdraw his or her participation in future study 
procedures, the subject will be asked to delay consent withdrawal to allow for a final safety visit and final safety telephone call. The subject will be asked to return to the study site for a final safety visit within 14 days of asking to withdraw consent. The subject will also be asked to have a final 
telephone call 28 days (+ 5 days) after taking their last dose of study drug.  
 
In the event a subject no longer wishes to have their personal health information used for the analysis of this study, he or she will notify the site through an authorized letter a nd his or her data will no 
longer be included as part of the results for this study.  
5.3.2 Termination of Study  
This study may be prematurely terminated if, in the opinion of the Principal I nvestigator or Medical 
Monitor , there is sufficient reasonable cause.   
 Circumstances that may warrant termination include, but are not limited to: 
• Determination of unexpected, significant, or unacceptable risk to subjects.  
• Enrollment is unsatisfactory.  
• Insufficient adherence to protocol requirements.  
• Data that is not sufficiently complete and/or evaluable.

 6 TREATMENTS ADMINISTE RED  
6.1 Treatments   
6.1.1 Study Product Description  
 
Inosine (chemical name: hypoxanthine 9 -β-D-ribofuranoside) is an intermediary metabolite of purine 
metabolism (structure shown below) that is ultimately converted into urate . 
 
Chemical Formula: C10H12N4O5  
Molecular Weight:  268.23 
 
 
 
Inosine is  a white powder . It is provided by a commercial vendor as 500 mg capsules for oral 
use.  
6.1.2 Treatments administered  
 
Inosine will be administered as one capsule twice a day for the first 3 weeks of the study. Inosine 
dose will be titrated at Week s 3, 6, 9, 12 and 16 to target urate levels (7 – 8 mg/dL).  Inosine  will 
be provided to each subject  in individually labeled containers by the site research pharmacy .  
 The following pre -specified titration algorithm will be used to adjust inosine dose based on urate 
levels measured at Week s 3, 6, 9, 12 and 16. 
 
Inosine in ALS  
V3.0  7/01/2019  
Page 30 of 75 
  
1- Serum urate < 67% increase from most recent level to lower limit of target range (7  
mg/dL) ==> incr ease by 2 caps/day, except:    
 
• If subject is already on 5 caps/day, then increase by 1 cap/day up to 6 caps/day.  
• If subject is already on 6 caps/day , then continue at this dose. 
 
2- Serum urate 67 -less than 100% increase from most recent level to lower limit of target 
range (7 mg/dL) ==> increase by 1 cap/day, except:  
 
• If subject is already at 6 caps/day , then continue at this dose. 
 
3- Serum urate within target range (7 -8 mg/dL)  ==> no change.  
 
4- Serum urate > upper limit of target range (8.1 mg/dL or higher) but ≤ 9.0 mg/dL ==> 
reduce by 1 cap/day the dose being taken at the most recent visit , except:  
 
• If subject was already down to 1 cap/day , s/he will continue at 1 cap/day .  
 
5- Serum urate > 9.0 mg/dL ==> hold treatment (i.e., take 0 caps/day) x 7 days, and then resume treatment at 1 less cap/day than the prior dose (i.e., at the most recent visit), except:   
 
• If that reduction results in no caps being taken, then continue the hold (i.e., 0 caps/day) x 7 more days, then resume treatment at 1 cap/day.  
 
6- If a subjec t returns 3 consecutive serum urate levels > 9.0 mg/dL, then the study drug will 
be permanently discontinued due to “excess sensitivity to study drug” ( This will not be 
treated as an adverse event ( AE)).    
 
7- If a subject’s baseline level is ≥ 7.0 mg/dL, study drug will be held until the Week 3 labs.  
 
6.2 Receiving, Storage, Dispensing  
6.2.1 Receipt of Drug Supply  
 
Inosine will be shipped from the central pharmacy  to the study research pharmacies .

Page 31 of 75 
  
6.2.2 Storage  
 
The drug supply will be kept  at the site research pharmacies in a locked, safe area at controlled room 
temperature with access limited to those directly involved in the study.  
 
6.2.3 Dispensing of Study Drug  
 
Inosine  will be provided to each subject  in individually labeled container s by the site research 
pharmacies . Subject compliance will be determined at the end of the study as detailed below.  
6.3 Modification of Study Intervention/Investigational Product for a Subject  
Any dosage adjustment, including the reason for and dates of a djustment, will be documented in the 
CRF for each subject requiring this manipulation. The Site  Investigator ( SI) or licensed physician 
Sub- Investigator may reduce the dosage of study drug or di scontinue the study drug in its entirety for 
adverse events (A Es) thought to be related to the study drug or for other reason during the trial (the 
reason for, and dates of suspension or dose reduction must be documented).  If the AE is mild or moderate, the dosage may be reduced until the event improves.  The SI may then choose to resume 
the higher dosage or maintain the subject at a reduced dos age.  
 If the event is serious or life threatening, and deemed to be definitely drug related, the study drug will be discontinued immediately. Study subjects must remain off the study drug permanently. 
Subjects may not resume study drug.  All AEs will be followed to resolution.  
 6.3.1 Precautionary suspensions  
Investigators may approve a brief non- AE-triggered suspension of study drug employed as a medical 
precaution (e.g., a s in a peri -operative suspension of study drug required by the subject’s surgeon for 
an elective procedure, during a day of potential dehydration as in religious fasting, etc).  
6.3.2. Dosage Discontinuation  
Reasons for discontinuation of study medication m ay include an AE, Medical Monitor or Principal  
Investigator recommendation, protocol deviation, los s-to-follow -up, subject r equest, or death.   
 
 
Inosine in ALS  
V3.0  7/01/2019  
Page 32 of 75 
 Study subjects who discontinue study drug prematurely (early termination from study) will be 
encouraged to return for a Final Safety Visit and participate in a Follow -Up Telephone Call 28 days 
(+ 5 days) after the last dose of study drug.  
6.4 Accountability Procedures  
At the completion of the study, there will be a final reconciliation of drug consumed and drug 
remaining.  This reconciliation will be logged on the drug reconciliation form, signed and dated.  
Any discrepancies noted will be investigated, resolved, and documented prior to return or destruction 
of unused study drug.  Drug destroyed on site will be documented in the study files.  
6.5 Prior and Concomitant Therapy  
Throughout the study, the subject  may be prescribe d concomitant medications or treatments deemed 
necessary to provide adequate supportive care provided that the medications are licensed in the United States.  All concomitant medications and/or treatments received by a su bject should be 
recorded on the appropriate source document and eCRF. 
6.5.1 Prohibited Medications and Contraindications  
Prohibited Medications  
Throughout the course of the trial, study subjects should not be treated with the following 
medications.  If, for safety or health reasons, or by subject choice, the prohibited medication cannot 
be stopped, then the study medication should be stopped. 
 Prohibited medications include:  
• Inosine from a different source  
• Allopurinol  
• Probenecid  
• More than 300mg Vitamin C daily  (please note that a daily multivitamin containing vitamin 
C is allowed)  
 
Pregnancy & Nursing Mothers  
There are no adequate and well -control led studies in pregnant women.   Subjects or partners of male 
subjects should not become pregnant during the study or 3 months after stopping study drug .  If a 
female subject becomes pregnant, study treatment must be disconti nued immediately.  
 It is not known whether  inosine is excreted in human milk.  Caution should be exercised; therefore, 
no subject should nurse their infant while pa rticipating in this study.

7.8 Protocol Deviations  
A protocol deviation is any noncompliance with the clinical trial protocol.  The noncompliance may 
be either on the part of the subject, the Site Investigator, or the study site staff.  As  a result of 
deviations, corrective actions are to be developed by the site and implemented promptly.  
  
All deviations from the protocol must be addressed in the subject’s source documents.  All major protocol deviations will be entered in the Protocol Deviations Log in the Electronic Data Capture 
(EDC) System and should be submitted to the site’s local IRB per institutional guidelines.  
7.8.1 Missed Visits and Procedures  
Missed visits and any procedures not performed (not attempted) for reasons other than  screen failure, 
illness, injury or progressive disability (i.e. subject is physically unable to perform test) will be reported as protocol deviations.    
 
Inosine in ALS  
V3.0  7/01/2019  
Page 37 of 75 
 Procedures or visits not performed due to screen failure, illness, injury or disability, including 
procedures that were attempted but failed (i.e. blood samples unable to be drawn after multiple 
attempts, or weight unable to be obtained due to subject immobility) will not be reported as protocol deviations.    Details and specific instructions regarding p rotocol deviations, including any exceptions to this 
standard procedure, are found in the Site Manual of Procedures.  
 7.9 Recording Deaths  
Information on whether a subject has died may be obtained by the subject’s family, clinic notes, or utilizing public means such as a reliable internet source such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) National Death Index ( http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/ndi.htm ) or the Social Security

 8 CLINICAL ASSESSMENTS  AND OUTCOME MEASURE S 
8.1 Clinical Variables  
Assessments will be performed at designated time -points throughout the study for clinical 
evaluation.  In addition to the assessments evaluated below, subjects will provide information on 
their demographics, past medical history, including ALS, as well as concomitant medication u sage. 
8.1.1 Vital Signs, Height & Weight  
Vital signs will be obtained after the subject has been in a seated position for sever al minutes.  Vital 
signs, including systolic and diastolic blood pressure, pulse rate (radial artery)/minute, respiratory rate/minute, temperature and weight will be assessed at specified visits.  Height will be measured 
and recorded at the Screening Visit  only.   
8.1.2 Clinical Laboratory Assessments  
 
The following laboratory tests will be performed during the study : 
 
o Serum u rate level  (Screening, Baseline, Weeks 3, 6, 9, 12, 16 and  20) 
o Urinalysis: albumin, bilirubin, blood, clarity, color, glucose, ketone s, nitrate, pH, protein, 
specific gravity, urobilinogen and WBC screen (Screening, Baseline, Week 12 and Week 20 
visits). Urine sediment analysis will be also performed at the Baseline, Week 12 and Week 
20 visits.  
o Serum human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) for women of childbearing potential 
(WOCBP) (Screening ONLY)  
o Hematology with differential panel: complete blood count with differential (hematocrit, hemoglobin, platelet count, RBC indices, Total RBC, Total WBC, and WBC & differential) (Baseline, Week 12  and Week 20)  
o Blood chemistry panel/Liver function tests (LFTs): alanine aminotransferase  (ALT (SGPT)), 
aspartate aminotransferase (AST (SGOT)), albumin, alkaline phosphatase, bicarbonate, 
blood urea nitrogen, calcium, chloride, creatinine, glucose, magnesium, phosphate, 
potassium, sodium, total bilirubin and total protein  (Screening, Baseline, Week 12 and Week 
20) 
 
Additional testing,  may be ordered  if needed, to further assess an adverse event (AE), or if there is 
any suspicion that a subject may be pre gnant, throughout the course of the study.  
 
Inosine in ALS  
V3.0  7/01/2019  
Page 39 of 75 
 8.1.3 Physical Examination  
A physical examination will be performed and recorded.  T he following systems will be examined: 
head/neck, eyes, ears, nose/throat, cardiovascular, lungs, abdomen, musculoskeletal, central nervous 
system, extrem ities, and skin.   
8.1.4 Neurological Examination  
A neurological examination will be performed and recorded .   
8.1.5 Adverse Events  
Adverse events (AEs) will be documented at each study visit, including the Screening Visit once the informed consent form has been signed by the subject, and at all study visits, including the final 
telephone call 28 days after the last dose of study drug.  Information on adverse effects of study 
medication and on inter -current events will be determined at each visit by direct questioning of the 
subjects  and review of concomitant medications.  
8.1.6 ALSFRS -R 
The ALSFRS -R is a quickly administered (5 minutes) ordinal rating scale (ratings 0- 4) used to 
determine subjects' assessment of their capability and independence in 12 functional activities.  All 12 activities are relevant in ALS. Initial validity was established by documenting that in ALS patients, change in ALSFRS -R scores correlated with change in strength over time, was closely 
associated with quality  of life measures, and predicted survival. The test -retest reliability is greater 
than 0.88 for all test items. The advantages of the ALSFRS -R are that the categories are relevant to 
ALS, it is a sensitive and reliable tool for assessing activities of dail y living function in those with 
ALS, and it is quickly administered.  With appropriate training the ALSFRS -R can be administered 
with high inter -rater reliability and test- retest reliability.  The ALSFRS -R can be administered by 
phone with good inter -rater and test -retest rel iability.  The equivalency of phone versus in- person 
testing, and the equivalency of study subject versus caregiver responses have also recently been 
established.   Therefore, if necessary, the ALSFRS -R may be given to the study subject over the 
phone.  All ALSFRS -R evaluators must be NEALS certified.  
8.1.7 Pulmonary Function Testing  
Pulmonary Function Testing includes Slow Vital Capacity (SVC).  
 
Slow Vital Capacity (SVC) : The vital capacity (VC) (percent of predicted normal) will be 
determined, using the upright slow VC method. The VC can be measured using conventional spirometers that have had a calibration check prior to subject testing.  A printout from the spirometer 
of all VC trials will be retained .  Three VC trials are required for  each testing session, however up to 
5 trials may be performed if the variability between the highest and second highest VC is 10% or 
greater for the first 3 trials. Only the 3 best trials are recorded on the CRF.

 8.1.8  C-SSRS 
The US FDA recommends the u se of a suicidality assessment instrument  that maps to the Columbia 
Classification  Algorithm for Suicide Assessment (C -CASA)62. The C -CASA was developed to assist 
the FDA in coding suicidality data accumulated during the conduct  of clinical  trials of antidepressant 
drugs. One such assessment instrument is the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C -SSRS)63. 
The C -SSRS involves a series of probing questions to inquire about possible suicidal thinking and 
behavior.  
Only investigators who have been fully trained in the administration of the C -SSRS will assess 
subject suicidality. As part of training, investiga tors are prepared to respond to and manage instances 
in which patients express suicidal ideation  or exhibit suicidal behavior . 
At the Baseline Visit, the C -SSRS Baseline  version will be administered. This version is used to 
assess suicidality over the subject’s lifetime and specifically for the previous 6 month time period.  
At the Week 12 and the Final Safety visit, as applicable, the Since Last Visit version of the C -SSRS 
will be administered. This version of the scale assesses suicidality since the subject’s last visit.  
Information obtained from: http://www.cssrs.columbia.edu/  
8.1.9 Mobile  App Study  
The objective of the proposed study is to test the feasibility and utility of a novel smartphone 
application (‘app’) for monitoring disease progression in patients with Amyotrophic Lateral 
Sclerosis (ALS). Th e cell phone app will collect two broad categories of data:  
1) “Actively collected data,” wherein the subject  is instructed to complete selected 
activities,  and data about these activities  is recorded, and  
2) “Passively collected data,” wherein data is recorded  as the subject  performs everyday 
activities naturally using existing cell phone sensors  
 
Data will be collected from the subjects’  smartphones over the course of the study (20 weeks) , and 
only pre -specified forms of data will be accessed and collected by the app. In addition, the subject 
will be asked about their general smartphone usage.  
8.1.11 Exit Questionnaire  
An Exit questionnaire will be collected at Week 20  and will include a trial satisfaction survey  and a 
blindedness questionnaire.

 9 SAFETY AND A DVERSE EVENTS  
The adverse event (AE) definitions and reporting procedures provided in this protocol comply with 
all applicable regulations and International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) guidelines.  The 
Principal  Investigator will carefully monitor ea ch subject throughout the study for possible adverse 
events.  All AEs will be documented on CRFs designed specifically for this purpose.  It is also 
important to report all AEs, especially those that result in permanent discontinuation of the 
investigation al product being studied, whether serious or non- serious.  
9.1 Definitions of AEs, Suspected Adverse Drug Reactions & SAEs  
9.1.1 Adverse Event and Suspected Adverse Drug Reactions  
An adverse event (AE) is any unfavorable and unintended sign (including a cli nically significant 
abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with a study, 
use of a drug product or device whether or not considered related to the drug product or device.  
 Adverse drug reactions (ADR) are all n oxious and unintended responses to a medicinal product 
related to any dose.  The phrase “responses to a medicinal product” means that a causal relationship 
between a medicinal product and an adverse event is at least a reasonable possibility, i.e., the relationship cannot be ruled out.  Therefore, a subset of AEs can be classified as suspected ADRs, if 
there is a causal relationship to the medicinal product.  
 
Examples of adverse events include: new conditions, worsening of pre -existing conditions, clinicall y 
significant abnormal physical examination signs (i.e. skin rash, peripheral edema, etc), or clinically 
signif icant abnormal test results (i.e. lab values or vital signs), with the exception of outcome 
measure results, which are not being recorded as adve rse events in this trial (they are being collected, 
but analyzed separately). Stable chronic conditions (i.e., diab etes, arthritis) that are present prior to 
the start of the study and do not worsen during the trial are NOT considered adverse events.  Chro nic 
conditions that occur more frequently (for intermittent conditions) or with greater severity, would be 
considered as worsened and therefore would be recorded as adverse events. 
 Adverse events are generally detected in two ways:  
  
Clinical   symptoms r eported by the subject or signs detected on examination. 
 
 
Inosine in ALS  
V3.0  7/01/2019  
Page 42 of 75 
 Ancillary Tests   abnormalities of vital signs, laboratory tests, and other diagnostic 
procedures (other than the outcome measures, the results of which are not being captured as 
AEs).  
 For the purposes of this study, symptoms of progression/worsening of ALS, including ‘normal’ 
progression, will be r ecorded as adverse events.     
 
The following measures of disease progression will not be recorded as adverse events even if they 
worsen (they are being recorded and analyzed separately): vital capacity results and ALSFRS -R 
results.  
 If discernible at the time of completing the AE log, a specific disease or syndrome rather than 
individual associated signs and symptoms should be identified by the Site Inve stigator and recorded 
on the AE log.  However, if an observed or reported sign, symptom, or clinically significant 
laboratory anomaly is not considered by the Site Investigator to be a component of a specific disease or syndrome, then it should be recorded as a separate AE on the AE log.  Clinically significant 
laboratory abnormalities, such as those that require intervention, are those that are ident ified as such 
by the Site Investigator.  
 
Subjects will be monitored for adverse events from the time they si gn consent until completion of 
their participation in the study (defined as death, consent withdrawal, loss to follow up, early study 
termination for other reasons or following completion of the entire study).   
 The following will be considered Adverse Ev ents of Special Interest regardless of severity: 
nephrolithiasis, urolithiasis, and gout y arthritis . 
9.1.2 Serious Adverse Events  
A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as an adverse event that meets any of the following criteria:  
1. Results in death. 
2. Is life threatening: that is, poses an immediate risk of death as the event o ccurred.  
a. This serious criterion applies if the study subject, in the view of the Site Investigator 
or Sponsor, is at immediate risk of death from the AE as it occurs .  It does not appl y 
if an AE hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe.  
3. Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization. 
a. Hospitalization for an elective procedure (including elective PEG tube/g -tube/feeding 
tube plac ement) or a routinely scheduled treatment is not an SAE by this criterion 
because an elective or scheduled “procedure” or a “treatment” is not an untoward 
medical occu rrence.  
 
Inosine in ALS  
V3.0  7/01/2019  
Page 43 of 75 
 4. Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity.  
a. This serious criterion applies if the “disability” caused by the reported AE results in a 
substantial disruption of the subject’s ability to carry out normal life functions. 
5. Results in congenital anomaly or birth defect in the offspring of the subject (whether the subject is male or female).   
6. Necessitates medical or surgical intervention to preclude permanent impairment of a body function or pe rmanent damage to a body structure.  
7. Important medical events that may not result in death, are not life -threatening, or do not 
require hospitalization may also be considered SAEs when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.  Examples of such medical events include blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalization, or the 
development of drug d ependency or drug abuse.  
 
An inpatient hospital admission in the absence of a precipitating, treatment -emergent, clinical 
adverse event may meet criteria for "seriousness" but is not an adverse experience, and will 
therefore, not be considered an SAE.  An example of this would include a social admission (subject 
admitted for other reasons than medical, e.g., lives far from the hospital, ha s no place to sleep).  
 
The Site Investigator is responsible for classifying adverse events as serious or non- serious.  
9.2 Assessment and Recording of Adverse Events  
The Site Investigator will carefully monitor each subject throughout the study for possible  AEs.  All 
AEs will be documented on CRFs designed specifically for this purpose.  All AEs will be collected and reported in the electronic data capture (EDC) system and compiled into reports for periodic 
reviewing by the Medical Monitor. The Medical Monit or shall promptly review all information 
relevant to the safety of the investigational product, including all serious adverse events (SAEs).  Special attention will be paid to those that result in permanent discontinuation of the investigational 
product be ing studied, whether ser ious or non- serious. 
9.2.1 Assessment of Adverse Events  
At each visit (including telephone interviews), the subject will be asked if they have had  any 
problems or symptoms since their  last visit in order to determine the occurrence of adverse events.   
If the subject reports an adverse event, the Investigator will probe fur ther to determine:  
1. Type of event  
2. Date of onset and resolution (duration)  
3. Severity (mild, moderate, severe)  
4. Seriousness (does the event meet the above definition for an SAE)  
 
Inosine in ALS  
V3.0  7/01/2019  
Page 44 of 75 
 5. Causality, relation to investigational product and disease  
6. Action taken regarding investigational product  
7. Outcome  
9.2.2 Relatedness of Adverse Event to Investigational Product  
The relationship of the AE to the investigational product should be sp ecified by the Site Investigator, 
using the fol lowing definitions:  
 
1.  Not Related:           Concomitant illness, accident or event with no reasonable association with treatment.  
 2.  Unlikely:    The reaction has little or no temporal sequence from administration of the investigational product, and/or a more likely alternative etiology 
exists.  
 
3.  Possibly Related:   The reaction follows a reasonably temporal sequence from administration of the investigational product and follows a known 
response pattern to the suspected investigational product; the reaction 
could have been produced by the investigational product or could 
have been produced by the subject’s clinical state or by other modes 
of therapy administered to the subject. (Suspected ADR)  
 
4.  Probably Related:   The reaction follows a reasonably temporal sequence from administration of investigational product; is confirmed by 
discontinuation of the investigational product or by re -challenge; and 
cannot be reasonably explained by the known characterist ics of the 
subject’s clinical state. (Suspected ADR)  
 5.  Definitely Related:   The reaction follows a reasonable temporal sequence from 
administration of investigational product; that follows a known or expected response pattern to the investigational product; and that is 
confirmed by improvement on stopping or reducing the dosage of the 
investigational product, and reappearance of the reaction on repeated exposure. (Suspected ADR)  
9.2.3 Recording of Adverse Events  
All clinical adverse events are recorded i n the Adverse Event (AE) Log in the subject’s study binder. 
The site should fill out the AE Log and enter the AE information into the Electronic Data Capture 
 
Inosine in ALS  
V3.0  7/01/2019  
Page 45 of 75 
 (EDC) sy stem within 48 hours of the site learning of a new AE or receiving an update on an existin g 
AE.   
 
Please Note: Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) must be reported to the Medical Monitor and Coordination Center within 24 hours of the site learning of the SAE.  
 
Entries on the AE Log (and into the EDC) will include the following: name and severity of  the event, 
the date of onset, the date of resolution, relationship to investigational product, action taken, and 
primary out come of event.   
 
9.3 Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events -  Reportable Events  
The following are considered reportable events and must be reported to the Medical Monitor and Coordination Center within 24 hours of the site being notified of the event.  
 
o All events that meet the above criteria for Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)  
 
o Dosage Changes (Dose Management)  
o Investigational Product Suspension, Reduction or Re -challenge  
o Investigational Product Discontinuation 
 
o Key Study Events:  
o Subject Final Disposition  
o Feeding Tube Placement  
o Permanent Assisted Ventilation (PAV)*  
o Tracheostomy  
o Mortality  
o Pregnancy  
o Diaphragm Pacing System (DPS) device  implantation  
o Emergency or Accidental Unblinding Events  
 
* Permanent Assisted Ventilation (PAV) is defined as more than 22 hours daily of non- invasive 
mechanical ventilation for more than one week (7 days).  The date of onset of PAV is the first day of the seven days.  
 
9.4  Known Adverse Event/ Experience Prophylaxis Plan  
Acidic urine is a major risk factor for uric acid urolithiasis, which form from uric acid crystals. 
Accordingly, urine samples will be collected at in -person site visits for urinalysis to determine 
pH. A pre -specified  algorithm will be followed for triggering urine alkalinization therapy for uric 
acid stone prophylaxis , starting at the Baseline visit. Because urate- elevating inosine treatment 
does not have an appreciable effect on urine pH as demonstrated in SURE -PD, the rate of 
 
Inosine in ALS  
V3.0  7/01/2019  
Page 46 of 75 
 alkalinization due to low urine pH will be similar in placebo - and inosine -assigned subjects, 
mitigating any unblinding effect.  
9.4.1   Alkalinization Protocol  
Site staff will receive notification from the Coordinati on Center  of the need to initiate alkalinization 
within a few days of the urinalysis that triggers the protocol. The following steps should then be 
taken:  
 
1- Site staff will prescribe “lower -dose” potassium citrate, which depends on subject weight (as 
record ed most recently on a study visit): 
•   Less than 70 kg:  10 mEq, in tablet form, po tid (with meals)  
•   70 kg or greater:  10 mEq, in tablet form, po qid (with meals and at bedtime)  
 
2- Staff will phone the subject to review the purpose, administration, potenti al adverse effects 
of potassium citrate, and plan rechecking urine pH and labs (CBC and BMP) in two weeks. 
In addition, staff will review recommendations for adequate hydrat ion. The prescriber should 
review with the subject:  
• Any contraindications to potas sium citrate, including a history of peptic ulcer 
disease, current use of an anticholinergic agent (e.g., trihexyphenidyl), hyperkalemia or renal insufficiency per most recent electrolyte measurements, or an active urinary tract infection.  
o If potassium ci trate were deemed contraindicated (or later found insufficient) 
then site staff may work with the Medical Safety Monitor to employ an alternative dosing schedule or an alternative alkalinizing agent such as sodium bicarbonate.  
• Potential adverse effects of potassium citrate, including minor gastrointestinal complaints, such as abdominal discomfort, vomiting, diarrhea, loose bowel movements or nausea, and rarely gastrointestinal bleeding. The subject should be instructed to check with site staff or another doctor at once if tarry stools or other evidence of gastrointestinal bleeding is noticed.  
• The possibility of abnormal results of blood lab test that will be monitored regularly 
on subsequent visits. 
• The importance of taking each dose faithfully, and without  crushing, chewing or 
sucking the tablet, and to check with physician if there is trouble swallowing tablets 
or if the tablet seems to stick in the throat. Subjects should not change dosing alkalinization medication until instructed to do so based on follow -up urinalysis 
results.  
 
3- Site staff will order urine pH and labs (CBC and BMP) to be collected two weeks after the initiation of urine alkalinization and will follow the algorithm in the figure to adjust 
 
Inosine in ALS  
V3.0  7/01/2019  
Page 47 of 75 
 alkalinization therapy. U rine pH and labs (CBC and BMP) will be collected every two weeks 
as needed per algorithm illustrated in the figure.  
• For subjects on “lower -dose” potassium citrate who are instructed to increase it to 
“higher -dose” potassium citrate, they will be instructed to double their current d ose. 
Depending on their weight:  
i. less than 70 kg:   20 mEq, in tablet form, po tid (with meals)  
ii. 70 kg or greater:   20 mEq, in tablet form, po qid (with meals and at bedtime)  
4- For any deviations from compliance with the medication site staff will contact the  CCC  who 
may engage the Medical Safety Monitor to obtain guidance.  
5- Subjects will be instructed to follow this algorithm for alkalinization for the duration of the 
treatment period of the trial.  Any alkalinization therapy ongoing at the time of Week 20  visit 
will be discontinued immediately after that visit (or at the time of study drug discontinuation if occurring earlier) irrespective of urine pH results at the visit.

9.4.2   Lab Monitoring during Alkalinization Protocol  
Current full prescribing information for potassium citrate indicates that laboratory tests should be 
checked every 4 months for:  
• Electrolytes (to monitor for potassium elevation)  
• Creatinine (to monitor for renal disease, a risk factor for hyperkalemic complications)  
• CBC (to monitor for anemia as an indicator of gastrointestinal bleeding due to mucosal lesions, 
which have been observed rarely on solid potassium treatments – at an estimated frequency of 
approximately 1 lesion per 100,000 patient -years).  
 
 
Inosine in ALS  
V3.0  7/01/2019  
Page 49 of 75 
 Under the study protocol labs w ill be monitored even more frequently as per algorithm above.  
 
If hyperkalemia develops while a subject is taking potassium citrate, it should be suspended. 
Potassium testing should be repeated within 7 days of the suspension. If serum potassium falls back into the normal range, then the potassium citrate will be resumed at a reduced dosage in an effort to 
find a lower dosage that does not produce hyperkalemia but on which urine pH remains above  5. If 
hyperkalemia remains, the potassium citrate will be disc ontinued.  An alternative, non- potassium -
based alkalinization measure may be tried if the Medical Safety Monitor and Site Investigator 
believe such a measure is warranted.  If a non -potassium -based alkalinization measure is not 
warranted, then the subject should discontinue study drug.  
 
If a significant rise in serum creatinine or a significant fall in blood hematocrit or hemoglobin 
develops while a subject is taking potassium citrate, it should be suspended and the source of the 
abnormality determined. If  these abnormalities are attributable to irreversible renal disease or to 
gastrointestinal bleeding, then the potassium citrate should not be resumed.  Consideration may be 
given to an alternative, non- potassium -based alkalinization measure if the Medical Safety Monitor 
and Site Investigator believe such a measure is warranted.

 10 SAFETY MONITORING AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS PLAN  
10.1 Safety Mon itoring  
An independent Medical Safety Monitor (M SM) will review receive a quarterly  report of all AEs  
and safety l aboratory tests. Recommendations for modification or termination of the trial based on 
safety data will be made by the M SM to the PI  and the DSMB .   
 
The Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will periodically review blinded, and if necessary, unblinded medical event data. SAEs, drug suspensions/rechallenges, drug discontinuations, and 
premature withdrawals will be tracked in real time, and the DSMB alerted if any imbalances arise 
between treatment groups.  
 Unanticipated problems involving risks to subje cts or others including adverse events will be 
reported to the local site IRB in accordance with institutional guidelines for reporting unanticipated problems including adverse events.  
 If serum urate is found to be above target range (i.e. 8.1 mg/dL or hi gher), inosine dose will be 
reduced or treatment will be stopped following the pre -specified titration algorithm described in 
Section 6.  
10.2 Statistical Considerations  
10.2.1 Analysis Samples  
The As -treated (AT) sample will include all subjects who receive at least one dose of study drug 
classified according to the actual treatment received. An intention -to-treat (ITT) sample will include 
all randomized subjects classified according to their randomized treatment assignment without 
regard to compliance wit h their assigned treatment. The AT sample will be used as the primary 
sample for analyzing safety, tolerability, efficacy, and target engagement outcomes. Secondary 
analyses of safety outcomes will look at the AT sample with events censored after discontin uation of 
inosine among participants initiated on inosine and after initiation of inosine among participants 
initiated on placebo should any off -label use be detected. Secondary analysis of the ITT sample will 
be used to estimate efficacy in preparation fo r future phase 3 trials.

 10.2.2 Outcomes  
10.2.2.1 Safety outcomes  
The proportion of subjects experiencing one or more adverse events (AE) prior to treatment, one or 
more treatment -emergent (TE, defined as occurring any time after first dose of study drug ) AEs, one 
or more severe TE AEs, one or more serious TE AEs (SAE), one or more TE AEs of special interest 
(AESI, including gout, gouty arthritis, and kidney stones), and one or more AEs classified by 
MedDRA system organ class, higher level term, and prefe rred term over 24 weeks in the inosine 
group will be compared to the placebo group using one -tailed Fisher's exact tests at alpha = 0.05. 
The proportion of subjects experiencing one or more TE clinically significant abnormal labs for each safety assay perf ormed or clinically significant abnormal vital signs for each vital sign monitored 
over 24 weeks in the inosine group will be compared to the placebo group using Fisher's exact tests. As a sensitivity analysis, we will also analyze event rates using negati ve binomial models for each 
type of event, adjusting for each participant's length of follow -up. 
10.2.2.2 Tolerability  
Tolerance will be defined as completion of the 20 -week study without permanently discontinuing 
study drug or suspending study drug for gr eater than 28 days. Tolerability of inosine vs. placebo will 
be based on the proportion determined tolerant at week 20 and compared by Fisher's exact test from the AT sample. Serum urate elevation via oral inosine as titrated in this study will be judged 
tolerable if the lower one -sided 95% confidence bound on the proportion tolerant is greater than 
50%. 
10.2.2.3 Efficacy and target engagement  
Effects of treat ment on ALSFRS -R, will be analyzed in shared -baseline generalized least squares 
models with among -person effects of visit and the interaction of treatment group x post -baseline visit 
and within- person unstructured covariance among repeated measurements. Shared -baseline random -
slopes linear mixed models will be used to analyze high- frequency smartphone m etrics with fixed 
effects of time and treatment x post -baseline time and random  participant -specific intercepts and 
slopes with unstructured covariance.  Baseline characteristics will be compared by masked treatment 
groups prior to finalizing analysis of e fficacy outcomes to select covariates to include the models to 
avoid chance confounding.  Two -tailed tests at alpha = 0.05 will be used.  
10.2.2. Operational endpoints  
Accuracy of serum urate titration will be evaluated relative to the average levels from t he week 12 
visit onward and relative to the proportion of samples that are within the target range.  Inosine dosage associated with accurate titration will be summarized.  Urine pH trajectories and the 
frequency of alkalinization will be summarized.

V3.0  7/01/2019  
Page 52 of 75 
 10.2.2.5 Power Calculations  
Assuming that 50%, 20%, and 10% of participants in the placebo group are expected to experience 
an AE or a given type of AE, we will have 80% power to declare a significant treatment -dependent 
increase in the proportion experiencing an AE if at least 95%, 71%, and 59% of participants in the inosine group are expected to experience an AE, respectively. We will have 80% power to observing 
at least one instance of any inosine -associated AE with a true probability of occurrence of at least  
8%. For tolerability, we will have 80% power to declare inosine tolerable if the true proportion 
tolerant is at least 71%. Variance component estimates for calculating power for effects of treatment 
on ALSFRS -R are from a single arm pilot study of 25 participants on inosine for 20 weeks. Based on 
the follow -up schedule for this trial and assuming a random -slopes model, the estimated effective SD 
for ALSFRS -R slope per month is 1.4. Given this estimate, we will have 80% power to detect a 
difference in ALSFR S-R slopes between the inosine and placebo groups of 1.05 units per month.  
We will have 12% power for a difference in slopes of 0.3 units per month.

the Coordination Center within 24 hours of the site learning of the SAE.  Data collection is the 
responsibility of th e staff at the site under the supervision of the Site Investigator ( SI).  During the 
study, the SI  must maintain complete and accurate documentation for the study.  
 The EDC includes password protection.  An edit checking and data clarification process will  be put 
in place to ensure accuracy and completeness of the data base.  Logic and range checks as well as 
more s ophisticated rules may be built into the eCRFs to provide immediate error chec king of the 
data entered.  The system has the capability to automat ically create electronic queries for forms that 
contain data that are out of range, out of window, missing or not calculated correctly.  The site  will 
only have access to the queries concer ning their subjects.   
11.1.2 Data Lock Process  
The application wil l have the ability to lock the database to prevent any modification of data once 
the study is closed.  Once this option is activated, every user will have Read- Only access to the data. 
The database can only be locked after each Site Investigator (SI) has s igned off on their subjects and 
all queries have been resolved.   
11.1.3 Quality Assurance

 13 APPENDICES  
13.1 APPENDIX I: EL ESCORIAL WORLD FEDERATION OF NEUROLOGY CRITERIA 
FOR THE DIAGNOSIS OF  ALS  
 Information obtained from the web site: www.wfnals.org. 
 The diagnosis of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis [ALS] requires:  
A - The presence of:  
 (A:1) evidence of lower motor neuron (LMN) degeneration by clinical, electrophysiology  cal  
or  neuropathologic e xamination,  
 (A:2)  evidence of upper motor neuron (UMN) degeneration by clinical examination, and  
 (A:3) progressive spread of symptoms or signs within a region or to other regions, as 
determined  by history or e xamin ation, together with  
B - The absence of:  
 (B:1) electrophysiological and pathological evidence of other disease processes that might  
 explain the signs of LMN and/or UMN de generation, and  
 (B:2) neuroimaging evidence of other disease processes that might  explain the observed 
 clinical and electrophys iological signs.  
 
CLINICAL STUDIES IN THE DIAGNOSIS OF ALS  
A careful history, physical and neurological examination must search for clinical evidence of UMN 
and LMN signs in four regions [brainstem, cervical, thoracic, or lumbosacral spinal cord] (see Table 
1) of the central nervous sy stem [CNS]. Ancillary tests should be reasonably applied, as clinically 
indicated, to exclude other disease processes. These should include electrodiagnostic, neurophysiological, neuroimaging and clin ical laboratory studies.  Clinical evidence of LMN and 
UMN degeneration is required for the diagnosis of ALS.  The clinical diagnosis of ALS, without 
pathological confirmation, may be categorized into various levels of certainty by cl inical assessment 
alone depending on the presence of UMN and LMN signs together in the same topographical 
anatomic region in either the brainstem [bulbar cranial motor neurons], cervical, thoracic, or lumbosacral spinal cord [anterior horn motor neurons]. The terms Clinical Definite ALS and 
Clinically Probable ALS are used to d escribe these categories of clinical diagnostic ce rtainty on 
clinical criteria alone:  
 A. Clinically Definite ALS is defined on clinical evidence alone by the presence of UMN, as well  as 
LMN signs, in three regions.  
 
Inosine in ALS  
V3.0  7/01/2019  
Page 61 of 75 
  
B. Clinically Probable ALS is defined on clinical evidence alone by UMN and LMN signs in at least 
two regions with some UMN signs necessa rily rostral to (above) the LMN signs.  
 C. Clinically Probable ALS -  Laboratory -supported is defined when clinical signs of UMN and LMN 
dysfunction are in only one r egion, or when UMN signs alone are present in one region, and LMN 
signs defined by EMG criteria are present in at least two limbs, with proper application of neuroimaging and clinical laboratory protocols to e xclude other causes.  
 D. Clinically Possible ALS is defined when clinical signs of UMN and LMN dysfunction are found together in only one region or UMN signs are found alone in two or more regions; or LMN signs are found r ostral to UMN signs and the diagnosis of Clinically Probable -  Laboratory -supported ALS 
cannot be proven by evidence on clinical grounds in conjunction with electrodiagnostic, neurophysiologic, neuroimaging or clinical laboratory studies. Other diagnoses m ust have been 
excluded to accept a diagnosis of Clini cally Possible ALS.

SUICIDAL BEHAVIOR  
(Check all that apply, so long as these are separate events; must ask about all types)   
Lifetime  
Actual Attempt:  
A potentially self -injurious act committed with at least some wish to die, as a result of act.  Behavior was in part thought of as method to kill 
oneself. Intent does not have to be 100%.  If there is any intent/desire to die associated with the act, then it can be considered an actual suicide 
attempt. There does not have to be any injury or harm , just the potential for injury or harm. If person pulls trigger while gun is in mouth 
but gun is broken so no injury results, this is consider ed an attempt.   
Inferring Intent: Even if an individual denies intent/wish to die, it may be inferred clinically from the behavior or circums tances. For example, a 
highly lethal act that is clearly not an accident so no other intent but suicide can be inf erred (e.g., gunshot to head, jumping from window of a 
high floor/story). Also, if someone denies intent to die, but they thought that what they did could be lethal, intent may be inferred.  
Have you made a suicide attempt? 
Have you done anything to harm y ourself? 
Have you done anything dangerous where you could have died? 
What did you do?  
Did you______ as a way to end your life?  
Did you want to die (even a little) when you_____?  
Were you trying to end your life when you _____? Or did you think it was pos sible you could have died from_____? 
Or did you do it purely for other reasons / without ANY intention of killing yourself (like to relieve stress, feel better, get 
sympathy, or get something else to happen)?

□   □ 
Interrupted Attempt:    
When the person is interrupted (by an outside circumstance) from starting the potentially self -injurious act  (if not for that, actual attempt would 
have occurred).  
Overdose: Person has pills in hand but is stopped from ingesting.  Once they ingest any pills, this becomes an attempt rather  than an 
interrupted attempt. Shooting: Person has gun pointed toward self, gun is taken away by someone else, or is somehow prevented from pulling 
trigger. Once they pull the trigger, even if the gun fails to fire, it is an attempt. Jumping: Person is poised to jump, is grabbed and taken down  
from ledge. Hanging: Person has noose around neck but has not yet started to hang -  is stopped from doing so.

something else.

assembling a specific method (e.g., buying pills, purchas ing a gun) or preparing for one’s death by suicide (e.g., giving things away, writing a 
suicide note).

A potentially self -injurious act committed with at least some wish to die, as a result of act.  Behavior was in part thought of as method to kill 
oneself. Intent does not have to be 100%.  If there is any intent/desire to die associated with the act, then it can be considered an actual 
suicide attempt. There does not have to be any injury or harm , just the potential for injury or harm. If person pulls trigger while gun is

highly lethal act that is clearly not an accident so no other intent but suicide can be inferred (e.g., gunshot to head,  jumping from window of a

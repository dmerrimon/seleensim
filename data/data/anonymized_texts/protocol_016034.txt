NUMBER OF SITES  Single -site study  
  RATIONALE  Vitamin D clearance is an important an d often overlooked 
aspect of vitamin D biology that has relevant implications for the clinical assessment and treatment of vitamin D deficiency. The circulating concentration of 25- hydroxyvitamin D 
[25(OH)D] is the most widely accepted measure of vitamin D status, and vitamin D supplements are often prescribed and titrated based on 25(OH)D concentration. However, circulating concentrations of 25(OH)D are necessarily determined by both 25(OH)D production and 25(OH)D clearance. Therefore, 25(OH)D clearance lik ely plays an important role in the 
assessment of vitamin D status and the response to vitamin D supplementation.  
The goal of this study is to determine how 25(OH)D
3 clearance 
is affected by vitamin D 3 supplementation using a gold 
standard pharmacokinetic a pproach. We expect that this study 
will enhance interpretation of available diagnostic tests, inform the results of ongoing large clinical trials of vitamin D supplements, and help develop new strategies to target vitamin D to improve health.  
  STUDY DESIGN  This is a single -dose, open- label pharmacokinetic study that 
uses intravenous administration of a stable deuterium -labeled 
25(OH)D 3 to evaluate the metabolic clearance of 25(OH)D 3 in 
subjects that supplement their diet with vitamin D 3. These data 
will be compared with previously acquired “un -supplemented” 
measurements obtained from  the same patients. Th is study will 
only enroll subjects  who  previously participated in the CLEAR 
or CLEAR- CF protocol and from whom  un-supplemented 
measurements of 25(OH)D 3 clearance were obtained.  The 
CLEAR and CLEAR -CF protocols are both included under  
IND 115016. In this study, a repeat measurement of 25(OH)D 3 
clearance will be obtained from eligible subjects who are 
supplementing their diet with  a stable dose of Vitamin D 3, 
defined as cholecalciferol 2000 IU daily. The patterns of 25(OH)D
3 clearance in these patients , with and without 
vitamin D 3 supplementation, will be assessed .

  STATISTICS  
Primary Analysis Plan  We will compare the distribution of D 6-25(OH)D 3 clearance 
measured during this study to the distribution of D 6-25(OH)D 3 
clearance measured in the same participants in the un -
supplemented state during CLEAR or CLEAR -CF. We will use 
the paired t -test to test differences in these distributions. We 
will use linear regression with multiplicative interaction terms to explore whether CKD or CF modify the D
6-25(OH)D 3 
clearance response to vitamin D 3 supplementation. 
Rationale for Number of Subjects  With 20 participants, we can detect differences in D
6-
25(OH)D 3 clearance that are small (17.5 -55 mL/min depending 
on assumptions) compared to the mean value observed in CLEAR (351 mL/min) a nd compared to the change in 
clearance we expect based on preliminary data (>50%).

 1 BACKGROUND  
Vitamin D supplementation improves bone mineral density, helps prevent fracture in high-
risk populations, and may promote other aspects of health.1 The broad potential health benefits of 
vitamin D are currently being tested in large clinical trials, such as the Vitamin D and Omega- 3 
Trial (VITAL). Circulating concentrations of 25- hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] are currently the 
most widely accepted tool used to gauge the need for and response to vitamin D supplements. 
However, large inter -individual differences in circulating 25(OH)D concentration and the 
25(OH)D response to vitamin D supplementation are well documented. Furthermore, 25(OH)D 
is itself relatively inactive, and circulating 25(OH)D concentrations reflect only substrate available for conversion to the 1,25 -dihydroxyvitamin D [1,25(OH)
2D], the active vitamin D 
hormone.  
Vitamin D clearance is an important an d often overlooked aspect of vitamin D biology. 
Known clinical determinants of circulating 25(OH)D concentration, including dietary intake, sun exposure, adiposity, and race, focus almost entirely on vitamin D intake/production. These 
factors explain a minority of variability in circulating 25(OH)D concentration and the response 
to vitamin D supplementation. By definition, steady- state circulating concentrations of 25(OH)D 
are determined by both intake/production and clearance. Genetic heterogeneity in CYP24A1, the 
cytochrome P450 enzyme primarily responsible for 25(OH)D clearance, is also a known 
determinant of circulating 25(OH)D concentration. Our preliminary data suggest that vitamin D supplementation induces CYP24A1- mediated 25(OH)D clearance, and that kidney function may 
be an important determinant of the 25(OH)D clearance resp onse to vitamin D supplementation.  
The proposed studies will provide insight into the biology of 25(OH)D clearance that is 
likely to enhance interpretation of available diagnostic tests, inform the results of ongoing large 
clinical trials of vitamin D supp lements, and help develop new strategies to target vitamin D to 
improve health.  
1.1 Overview of Clinical Studies  
Deuterated and tritiated 25(OH)D
3  have been used previously to study metabolism of vitamin 
D3 in humans .2-6 In addition deuterium is has been used extensively to study metabolism and is 
considered safe.7 
2 STUDY RATIONALE  
Vitamin D may promote health through pleiotropic actions. Traditionally understood as a 
calcium regulatory hormone, 1,25- dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH) 2D, the potent hormonal form 
of vitamin D) binds to its target receptor to regulate the transcrip tion of hundreds of genes.1-8 
Vitamin D receptors are present in all nucleated cells in the body, and activation of vitamin D 
receptors modulates cellular processes related to proliferation, differentiation, fibrosis, cancer, 
cardiovascular diseases, and other chronic diseases.6-10 For each of these processes, large effects 
have been demonstrated in cell culture and animal -experimental models, and clinical 
epidemiology studies have observed associations of circulating vitamin D metabolite concentrations with clinical health outcomes. As an example, for cardiovascular diseases, 
1,25(OH)
2D and analogues promote nitric oxide -mediated endothelial vasodilation,11-16 down-
regulate vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation and migration into the intima,17 inhibit 
osteogenic differentiation of vascular smooth muscle cells,18 inhibit macrophage cholesterol 
uptake and foam cell formation,19-21 promote a shift from atherogenic Th1 to anti -atherogenic

 Th2 lymphocytes,22  reduce the development and progression of  ventricular hypertrophy,23-27 
mitigate cardiac fibrosis,27-30 and suppress the renin -angiotensin system in animal -experimental 
models.31-33 Cardioprotective biological actions of vitamin D are further supported by 
associations of low serum 25 -hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D]  and 1,25(OH) 2D concentrations 
with clinical hypertension, myocardial infarction, stroke, left ventricular hypertrophy, cancer, 
and mortality.34-46 The totality of evidence for vitamin D has motivated large clinical trials, 
currently underway, to test whether vitamin D treatment will reduce the risks of c ancer, 
cardiovascular disease, and other clinical health outcomes in the general population.  
Inter -individual differences in serum 25(OH)D concentration and the serum 25(OH)D 
response to vitamin D supplements are large.  The circulating concentration of 25( OH)D is 
widely accepted as a biomarker of total intake of vitamins D 3 and D 2 (cholecalciferol and 
ergocalciferol) from cutaneous synthesis and dietary consumption.1-3 Serum or plasma 25(OH)D 
concentration increases robustly to vitamin D supplementation or exposure to ultraviolet light. Circulating 25(OH)D concentration is also inversely correlated with a number of health outcomes, including bone mineral density, risk of hip fracture, incident cancer, and cardiovascular events. Therefore, circulating 25(O H)D concentration is used to define vitamin D 
sufficiency and deficiency. There is a known large variation across individuals and populations in circulating 25(OH)D concentration. Moreover, published trials demonstrate substantial heterogeneity in the biol ogic response to vitamin D treatment, defined by changes in parathyroid 
hormone (PTH), intestinal calcium absorption, bone turnover, and bone mineral density.
47 While 
clinical characteristics such as race (presumably due to differences in cutaneous vitamin D production due to skin pigmentation), sun exposure, dietary intake of vitamin D, and adiposity (presumably due to vitamin D volume of distribution/fat sequestration) are known to be associated  with circulating 25(OH)D concentration, they explain a minority of this variation. 
Additional reasons for differences in 25(OH)D and the 25(OH)D response to supplementation are poorly understood.  
Vitamin D clearance plays an important role in vitamin D b iology. Concentrations of vitamin 
D metabolites in blood and tissues must necessarily represent a balance of production and clearance. In health, CYP24A1 is the major enzyme responsible for catabolism of both 25(OH)D
3 and 1,25(OH) 2D3 (Figure 1 ).4,48-54 CYP24A1 is found in most tissues in the body and 
is rapidly induced by 1,25(OH) 2D3 to prevent 1,25(OH) 2D3 intoxication.55-57 Polym orphisms in 
CYP24A1 were found to be associated with circulating 25(OH)D concentration in a genome -
wide association study (GWAS).58 Similarly, in another GWAS, a polymorphism in CYP24A1 
showed the strongest association with the circulating concentration of PTH, a hormone known to regulate and be regulated by 1,25(OH)
2D.59 In unpublished data, we 
found a CYP24A1 polymorphism to also be most strongly associated with the serum co ncentration of fibroblast growth 
factor -23, another hormone known to 
regulate and be regulated by 1,25(OH)
2D. 
Inactivating mutations in CYP24A1 have 
been found to cause “idiopathic” infantile 
hypercalcemia, characterized by excess 
1,25(OH) 2D-mediated intestinal calcium 
absorption and hypercalcemia,

 particularly with vitamin D supplementation.49 These observations demonstrate that vitamin D 
clearance is critical for maintaining proper vitamin D and calcium homeostasis, perhaps most 
crucially in the context of vitamin D supplementation.  
Serum 24,25(OH)2D3 (or its ratio with 25(OH)D3) maybe a useful novel biomarker of 
functional vitamin D status. Because CYP24A1 is found in most tissues  in the body and is 
rapidly induced by 1,25(OH) 2D3,55-57 CYP24A1 expression is commonly used as a marker of 
tissue 1,25(OH) 2D3 activity in basic science.64-80 However, the ability of vitamin D catabolism to 
reflect 1,2 5(OH) 2D3 function has not been similarly harnessed for clinical use. Evaluation of 
circulating 24,25(OH) 2D3 concentration may offer this opportunity. 24,25(OH) 2D3 is the most 
abundant product of 25(OH)D 3 catabolism by CYP24A1.49 When viewed in the context of 
prevailing 25(OH)D 3, 24,25(OH) 2D3 reflects CYP24A1 activity. 24,25(OH) 2D3 circulates at 
high concentrations (generally 1- 10 ng/mL)81,82 and has a circulating half -life of approximately 7 
days.83 Circulating 24,25(OH) 2D3 appears to come from both renal and non- renal sources.54,67,84-
86 In the kidney proximal tubule, CYP24A1 transcription is induced by fibroblast growth factor -
23 and suppr essed by PTH.56,87 In our work, we have found chronic kidney disease (CKD, 
specifically low estimated glomerular filtration rate, or eGFR) to be strongly correlated with serum 24,25(OH)
2D3 concentration .  
Our preliminary data suggest that vitamin D supplementation increases vitamin D 
catabolism. W e recently published a study assessing the effects of vitamin D 2 (ergocalciferol) 
supplementation on circulating vitamin D metabolites and vitamin D regulatory hormones.88 We 
enrolled 25 participants with CKD (eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73m
2) and 44 
participants with eGFR ≥60 mL/min/1.73m
2 and treated each with 
vitamin D 2 50,000 IU twice weekly for 
5 weeks. We measured vitamin D metab olites at baseline and the end of 
treatment using the precise mass spectrometry methods described in Section 4e of Approach. Among other findings, we reported that vitamin D
2 
supplementation significantly increase 
serum 24,25(OH) 2D3 to 25(OH)D 3 
ratio (Tabl e 2.1), suggesting induction 
of 25(OH)D 3 clearance. We 
hypothesized that induced clearance 
contributed to maintenance of normal circulating 1,25(OH) 2D concentrations. Notably, the 
magnitude of increase in 24,25(OH) 2D3 to 25(OH)D 3 ratio was blunted among pa rticipants with 
CKD, suggesting that the decreased 25(OH)D 3 clearance suggested by low 24,25(OH) 2D3 
concentrations in our cross -sectional studies extends to the setting of vitamin D 2 
supplementation. The use of vitamin D 2 as the supplement allowed us to differentiate exogenous 
from endogenous vitamin D metabolites, but an important limitation (to be addressed with the 
proposed studies) was that we could not differentiate true induction of clearance from a shift in 
availabl e CYP24A1 substrate from 25(OH)D 3 to 25(OH)D 2.  Table 2.1. Effects of vitamin D 2 supplementation

 In summary, despite widespread interest in vitamin D an intervention to improve diverse 
aspects of health, little attention has been paid to the role of clearance in vitamin D biology. 
Clearance is a fundamental component of vitamin D homeostasis and is likely to be an important determinant of both steady state 25(OH)D concentrations and the biologic response to vitamin D supplementation. Our preliminary data suggest that vitamin D clearance induces CY P24A1-
mediated 25(OH)D clearance, and that clinical characteristics ( e.g. kidney function) modify this 
response. Our preliminary data further support the concept that circulating 24,25(OH)
2D3 
concentration is a useful biomarker of CYP24A1- mediated 25(OH)D clearance. However, most 
studies performed to date, including our own, have used biomarkers to evaluate the effects of vitamin D supplements on vitamin D clearance.  In this study, we will use gold standard 
pharmacokinetic studies to assess the 25(OH)D
3 clearance response to vitamin D 3 
supplementation.  
2.1 Risk / Benefit Assessment  
This study will not provide any direct benefit to the study subjects. Individual subjects may have a modestly reduced chance of adverse health events because their care will be monito red more 
closely than it might otherwise. Future patients may benefit from these studies by virtue of knowledge gained about the pathophysiology and ascertainment of impaired vitamin D metabolism.  
The risks of administering deuterated 25(OH)D
3 in tracer qu antities are low. 25(OH)D 3 is a 
naturally occurring substance and generally circulates in concentrations of 10- 50 ng/mL. The 
deuterated 25(OH)D 3 we propose to administer differs from the naturally occurring form only by 
the substitution of 6 hydr ogen atoms  with deuterium. This isotope is stable and has metabolic 
and biologic characteristics identical to the naturally occurring form. We will administer quantities intended to make small changes in total circulating 25(OH)D
3 concentration, i.e., an 
increase of  5 ng/mL.  
There is some risk of hypercalcemia with the administration 25(OH)D 3, but this risk is 
minimized by excluding participants with baseline 25(OH)D > 50 ng/mL and by administering quantities that raise 25(OH)D by only approximately 5 ng/mL. We will monitor for hypercalcemia during our research. If instances of hypercalcemia are observed, we will change our study protocol accordingly to prevent hypercalcemia in future participants. Moreover, this protocol will only enroll participants who successfull y completed a related protocol (CLEAR or 
CLEAR -CF) without adverse effect. This study also includes placement of peripheral 
intravenous catheters and blood draws. Risks include discomfort at the site of administration, 
minor bleeding associated with catheter placement , and anemia due to blood sampling. 
3 STUDY OBJECTIVES  
3.1 Primary Objective  
The goal of this study is to determine whether  25(OH)D
3 clearance is affected by vitamin D 3 
supplementation. The data obtained in this study will be compared to previously obtained “un-
supplemented” measurements taken in the same patients. Only subjects who  previously 
participated in the CLEAR or CLEAR -CF protocol and from whom un- supplemented, 
measurements of 25(OH)D 3 clearance were obtained will be enrolled in this st udy.   
Protocol  Number: CLEAR -01 Confidential  
 
Version #: 2.1 Version Date: 5/18/18 Page 15 of 40 
 3.2 Secondary Objectives  
• To explore whether disease status (chronic kidney disease or cystic fibrosis) modify the 
25(OH)D 3 clearance response to vitamin D 3 supplementation.  
• To evaluate biomarkers of 25(OH)D 3 clearance during vitamin D 3 supplementation.  
4 STUDY DESIGN 
This is a single -dose, open- label pharmacokinetic study that uses intravenous administration of a 
stable deuterium -labeled 25(OH)D 3 to evaluate the metabolic clearance of 25(OH)D 3 in subjects 
supplementing their diet with a stable dose of vit amin D 3. This study will enroll up to 20 subjects  
who previously participated in the CLEAR or CLEAR -CF protocol and from whom un-
supplemented measurements of 25(OH)D 3 clearance were obtained.   
Subjects who qualify and provide written informed consent will be prescribed a stable, standard 
dose of vitamin D 3 supplement (cholecalciferol, 2000 IU daily by mouth), to be taken throughout 
the duration of the study (approximately 6 months).  
After 3 months of vitamin D 3 run- in, participants will be re -screened for  eligibility (prior to 
receiving the intravenous labeled 25(OH)D 3 study drug). Participants who remain eligible at re -
screening  will receive a single dose of intravenous labeled 25(OH)D 3. Subsequent blood draws 
and urine collections will be used to determi ne the metabolic clearance of 25(OH)D 3 and related 
parameters. The metabolic clearance of 25(OH)D 3 during stable vitamin D 3 supplementation 
(obtained from this protocol) will be compared to the metabolic clearance of 25(OH)D 3 in the 
un-supplemented state ( obtained for the same participants during CLEAR or CLEAR -CF) to 
assess the effects of vitamin D 3 supplementation.  
5 CRITERIA FOR EVALUATION  
5.1 Primary Efficacy Endpoint  
The primary outcome of interest is the metabolic clearance of labeled 25(OH)D 3.  
We will mea sure serum concentrations of  24,25(OH) 2D3, 25(OH)D 3, 25(OH)D 2, 1,25(OH) 2D3 
and 1,25(OH) 2D2 at the University of Washington by mass spectrometry For each participant 
and time point, a single serum aliquot is used to measure this panel of vitamin D metabolites using by immunoaffinity extraction and HPLC -mass spectrometry (Xevo TQ, Waters Corp., 
Milford, MA) with deuterated internal standards.
53-56 
For each subject, non -compartmental analysis of plasma concentration versus time data will be 
performed using Phoenix software (Pha rsight, Cary, NC). Clearance will be calculated as 
administered 25(OH)D 3 dose divided by 25(OH)D 3 AUC. We focus on clearance as our primary 
outcome because it reflects the metabolism of 25(OH)D 3 accounting for circulating 25(OH)D 3 
concentration (units of v olume/time, akin to creatinine clearance). Clearance is independent of 
volume of distribution, in contrast to t 1/2, which will be evaluated as a secondary outcome. 
Clearance will be evaluated with and without adjustment for body size .   
5.2 Secondary Efficacy Endpoints  
• AUC of labeled D 6-25(OH)D 3  
• Terminal half -life of labeled D 6-25(OH)D 3 
Protocol  Number: CLEAR -01 Confidential  
 
Version #: 2.1 Version Date: 5/18/18 Page 16 of 40 
 • Volume of distribution in the central compartment of labeled D 6-25(OH)D 3 
• Metabolic formation clearance (metabolite/parent AUC ratio) for metabolites of labeled D 6-
25(OH)D 3 
5.3 Safety Evaluations  
An abnormal clinical laboratory value will be documented as an adverse event if one of the 
following applies:  
• The abnormality is not contradicted by a repeat test to confirm the abnormality. 
• The abnormality suggests a disease and/or orga n toxicity.  
• The abnormality is of a degree that requires active management ( e.g., requires a medication 
change, more frequent follow -up, or further diagnostic evaluation).  
Change in clinical laboratory findings (if there are specific labs, then why they ar e appropriate to 
measure, e.g. , BUN or Creatinine for an aminoglycoside)  
An adverse event (AE) is any symptom, sign, illness or experience that develops or worsens in severity during the course of the study.  Intercurrent illnesses or injuries should be re garded as 
adverse events.  Abnormal results of diagnostic procedures are considered to be adverse events if the abnormality:  
• results in study withdrawal  
• is associated with a serious adverse event  
• is associated with clinical signs or symptoms  
• leads to addit ional treatment or to further diagnostic tests  
• is considered by the investigator to be of clinical significance  
A serious adverse event is any AE that is:  
• fatal 
• life-threatening  
• requires or prolongs hospital stay  
• results in persistent or significant disab ility or incapacity  
• a congenital anomaly or birth defect  
• an important medical event  
Important medical events are those that do not fit the other definitions of serious adverse events, but the event may jeopardize the patient and may require treatment to prevent one of the listed serious adverse events.  
Adverse events will be reported if they occur between the time of informed consent and 30 days after the last study visit. All unresolved adverse events will be followed by the PI until resolution, the adve rse event is otherwise explained, or the participant is lost to follow -up. At the 
last study visit, the investigator will instruct each participant to report any subsequent event that the participant, or participant’s personal physician, reasonably believe s may be related to the 
study. The investigator will notify the study sponsor of any death or adverse event occurring after the participant has discontinued participation if the event can be reasonably related to the study.

7 CONCURRENT MEDICATIO NS 
All subjects will be asked to  take vitamin D 3 (cholecalciferol) 2000 IU daily by mouth, provided 
by the study. Vitamin D 3 is a common form of vitamin D supplement that is readily available by 
prescription or over the counter. Vitamin D 3 is administered orally, and 2000 IU daily is a 
common dose that is well below the tolerable upper intake level advised by the Institute of 
Medicine (4000 IU daily). This form and dose of vitamin D supplement is being actively studied 
in large clinical trials with clinical outcomes, such as the Vitamin D  and Omega -3 Trial 
(VITAL), which will increase the utility of the data generated from this study. Hypercalcemia is a rare but known potentially complication of vitamin D
3 supplementation (more commonly at 
higher doses), so serum calcium will be checked after 3 months of vitamin D 3 supplementation 
(at the re -screening visit), prior to administration of the deuterated 25(OH)D 3 study drug. 
Vitamin D 3 will be obtained from Carlson Laboratories; supporting information is supplied in 
the protocol appendix. Participants will be allowed to take up to 400 IU daily additional vitamin D supplements (as vitamin D
3 or vitamin D 3, alone or as part of a multivitamin) in addition to 
Protocol  Number: CLEAR -01 Confidential  
 
Version #: 2.1 Version Date: 5/18/18 Page 19 of 40 
 the 2000 IU daily provided by the study. Non- study vitamin D supplements exceeding 400 IU 
daily will be disallowed.  
Other s pecific allowed and disallowed medications  are detailed in Section 6 (Eligib ility Criteria ). 
All subjects  should be maintained on the same medications throughout the entire study period, as 
medically feasible, with no introduction of new chronic therapies.  
8 STUDY TREATMENTS  
8.1 Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups 
All consenting and qualified participants will be assigned to the single  treatment arm . 
8.2 Blinding  
Neither participants nor study investigators will be blinded to the study intervention.  
8.3 Formulation  of Test and Control Products  
We will administer labeled D 6-25(OH)D 3 Solution for Injection, 20 µg/mL intravenously. D 6-
25(OH) D 3 Solution for Injection, 20 µg/mL  has been manufactured according to current Good 
Manufacturing Practices  by SRI International ( Palo Alto, CA ). 
8.3.1 Formulation  of Test Product  
The labeled D6-25(OH)D 3 Solution for Injection, 20 µg/mL prepared by SRI International is 
formulated in cosolvents to enhance solubility.  Each mL contains 20 µg D 6-25(OH) D3, 60% 
propylene glycol (60%), 10% ethanol (ETOH) and water (30%) for injection, to volume.   
8.3.2 Packaging and Labeling  
The formulated drug product has bee n aliquoted into single -use vials by SRI International and 
frozen at <60°C for storage. Vial labels include the drug product name, concentration, batch 
number, manufacture date, and storage conditions, similar to the draft label shown below. 
 
8.4 Supply of St udy Drug  at the Site  
Single -use vials will be stored at <60°C at the University of Washington Investigational Drug 
Services or Kidney Research Institute. Individual doses of D 6-25(OH) D 3 Solution for Injection 
will be prepared for intravenous administratio n by the University of Washington Investigational 
Drug Services  by thawing and drawing the appropriate volume into a syringe . The prepared dose 
of will be calculated according to estimated blood volume  based on body weight . The prepared 

Protocol  Number: CLEAR -01 Confidential  
 
Version #: 2.1 Version Date: 5/18/18 Page 20 of 40 
 dosing syringe will be labeled with the participant’s full name, date of birth, and medical record 
number along with the drug contents. Once thawed, the drug product will be infused within eight 
hours of preparation.  
8.4.1 Dosage/Dosage Regimen  
Each participant will receive a single intravenous dose of D 6-25(OH) D 3 Solution for Injection, 
20 µg/mL . We will use estimated blood volume based on body weight to achieve a target 
concentration of  5 ng/mL  D6-25(OH) D 3. The target of 5 ng/mL was selected be cause it will 
allow precise tracking of circulating deuterated D6-25(OH) D 3concentration throughout follow -
up (based on known limits of detection for our assay) without substantially perturbing underlying 
vitamin D status. Theoretically, the dose required to achieve a 5 ng/mL increment in deuterated 25(OH)D
3 concentration can  be calculated as the targeted peak  concentration multiplied by the 
volume of distribution, which for 25(OH)D 3 is expected to be equal to blood volume . We will 
use the formula of Nadler et al ( 1962)  to estimate blood volume for each participant . We will 
begin the study by administering to each participant a dose of 5 ng/mL x estimated blood 
volume. A typical dose would be 32 µ g (1.6 mL) for an 85 kg individual . We have verified in 
CLEAR and CLEAR -CF that we achieve target  D6-25(OH)  D3 concentrations with this  
approach.  
8.4.2 Dispensing  
All study drug will be dispensed by the University of Washington Investigational Drug Services . 
8.4.3 Administration Instructions

11 ADVERSE EXPERIENCE REPORTING AND DOCUMENTATION 
11.1 Adverse Events  
An adverse event (AE) is any symptom, sign, illness or experience that develops or worsens in 
severity during the course of the study.  Intercurrent illnesses or injuries should be reg arded as 
adverse events.  Abnormal results of diagnostic procedures are considered to be adverse events if the abnormality:  
• results in study withdrawal  
• is associated with a serious adverse event  
• is associated with clinical signs or symptoms  
• leads to additi onal treatment or to further diagnostic tests  
• is considered by the investigator to be of clinical significance

 11.1.1 AE Severity  
The National Cancer Institute’s Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse E vents  (CTCAE) 
Version 3.0 should be used to assess and grade AE severity, including laboratory abnormalities 
judged to be clinically significant. The modified criteria can be found in the study manual.  If the experience is not covered in the modified criteria, the guidelines shown in Table 11.1  below 
should be used to grade severity.  It should be pointed out that the term “severe” is a measure of intensity and that a severe AE is no t necessarily serious.  
Table  11.1  AE Severity Grading  
Severity (Toxicity Grade)  Description  
Mild (1)  Transient or mild discomfort; no limitation in activity; no medical intervention or therapy required. The subject may be aware of  the sign or 
symptom but tolerates it reasonably well.  
Moderate (2)  Mild to moderate limitation in activity, no or minimal medical intervention/therapy required.  
Severe (3)  Marked limitation in activity, medical intervention/therapy required, hospitaliza tions possible. 
Life-threaten ing 
(4) The subject is at risk of death due to the adverse experience as it occurred. This does not refer to an experience that hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe.  
 
11.1.2 AE Relationship to Study Drug  
The relationship of an AE to the study drug should be assessed using the following the guidelines 
in Table 11.2.

Definitely  Previously known toxicity of agent; or an event that follows a reasonable 
temporal sequence from administration of the drug; that follows a known or expected response pattern to the suspected drug; that is confirmed by stopping or reducing the dosage of the drug; and that is not explained by any other 
reasonable hypothesis.  
Probably  An event that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of 
the drug; that follows a k nown or expected response pattern to the suspected 
drug; that is confirmed by stopping or reducing the dosage of the drug; and that is unlikely to be explained by the known characteristics of the subject’s clinical state or by other interventions.

Version #: 2.1 Version Date: 5/18/18 Page 26 of 40 
 Possibly  An event that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of 
the drug; that follows a known or expected response pattern to that suspected drug; but that could readily have been produced by a number of other factors.  
Unrelated  An e vent that can be determined with certainty to have no relationship to the 
study drug.  
11.2 Serious Adverse Experiences (SAE)  
An SAE is defined as any AE occurring at any dose that results in any of the following outcomes:  
• death  
• a life -threatening adverse exper ience  
• inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  
• a persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
Other important medical events may also be considered an SAE when, based on appropriate 
medical  judgment, they jeopardize the subject or require intervention to prevent one of the 
outcomes listed.  
A serious adverse event is any AE that is:  
• fatal 
• life-threatening  
• requires or prolongs hospital stay  
• results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
• a congenital anomaly or birth defect  
• an important medical event  
Important medical events are those that do not fit the other definitions of serious adverse events, 
but the event may jeopardize the patient and may require treatment to prevent one  of the listed 
serious adverse events.  
Adverse events will be collected if they occur between the time of informed consent and up to 30 
days after the last study visit. All unresolved adverse events will be followed by the PI until 
resolution, the adverse event is otherwise explained, or the participant is lost to follow -up. At the 
last study visit, the investigator will instruct each participant to report any subsequent event that the participant, or participant’s personal physician, reasonably believes ma y be related to the 
study. The investigator will notify the study sponsor of any death or adverse event occurring after the participant has discontinued participation if the event can be reasonably related to the 
study.  
11.3 Abnormal lab values  
An abnorma l clinical laboratory value will be documented as an adverse event if one of the 
following applies:  
1. The abnormality is not contradicted by a repeat test to confirm the abnormality. 
Protocol  Number: CLEAR -01 Confidential  
 
Version #: 2.1 Version Date: 5/18/18 Page 27 of 40 
 2. The abnormality suggests a disease and/or organ toxicity.  
3. The abnormality i s of a degree that requires active management (e.g ., requires  a 
medication change, more frequent follow -up, or further diagnostic evaluation).  
 
11.4 Hospitalization, Prolonged Hospitalization or Surgery  
Any adverse event that results in hospitalization or  prolonged hospitalization will be documented 
and reported as a serious adverse event unless specifically instructed otherwise in this protocol.  
Any condition responsible for surgery will be documented as an adverse event if the condition meets the criter ia for and adverse event. Neither the condition, hospitalization, prolonged 
hospitalization, nor surgery are reported as an adverse event in the following circumstances:  
1. Hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization for diagnostic or elective surgical proce dures 
for a preexisting condition.  Surgery should not be reported as an outcome of an adverse event if the purpose of the surgery was elective or diagnostic and the outcome was uneventful.  
2. Hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization required to allow eff icacy measurement for 
the study.  
3. Hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization for therapy of the target disease of the study, unless it is a worsening or increase in frequency of hospital admissions as judged by the clinical investigator.  
11.2.1 Serious Adverse Experience Reporting  
The PI will document all SAEs that occur (whether or not related to study drug) on an SAE 
Report Form.  The collection period for all SAEs will begin after informed consent is obtained until all procedures for the final study visit have been completed.  
All SAE  Report  Form s will be  reviewed by the PI.  SAE reports that are both related and 
unexpected will be sent to FDA within one business day of learning of the event.  SAE reports 
that are both related and unexpected will also be for warded to the UW Institutional Review 
Board, in accordance with UW Standard Operating Procedures.  Because this is an observational 
study, no data safety and monitoring board will be created for this trial. Adverse events and recruitment will be monitored by the PI and reported to the UW IRB, as described above.  
12 DISCONTINUATION AND REPLACEMENT OF SUBJE CTS  
12.1 Early Discontinuation of Study Drug   
A subject may be discontinued from study treatment  at any time if the subject, the investigator, 
or the S ponsor feel s that it is not in the subject’s best interest to continue.  The following is a list 
of possible reasons for study treatment discontinuation :  
• Subject withdrawal of consent   
• Subject is not compliant with study procedures  
• Adverse event  that in the opinion of the investigator would be in the best interest of the 
subject to discontinue study treatment  
• Protocol violation requiring discontinuation of study treatment  
Protocol  Number: CLEAR -01 Confidential  
 
Version #: 2.1 Version Date: 5/18/18 Page 28 of 40 
 • Lost to follow -up 
• Sponsor request for early termination of study 
• Positive p regnancy test (females)  
If a subject is withdrawn from treatment due to  an adverse event , the subject will be followed 
and treated by the Investigator until the abnormal parameter or symptom has resolved or 
stabilized.    
All subjects who discontinue study treatment should come in for an early discontinuation visit as 
soon as possible and then should be encouraged to complete all remaining scheduled visits and procedures.  
All subjects are free to withdraw from participation at any time, for any reason, speci fied or 
unspecified, and without prejudice.  
Reasonable attempts will be made by the investigator to provide a reason for subject withdrawals.  The reason for the subject’s withdrawal from the study will be specified in the subject’s source documents Refer to Section 10 for early termination procedures.  
12.3 Withdrawal of Subjects from the Study  
A subject may be withdrawn from the study at any time if the subject, the investigator, or the Sponsor feels that it is not in the subject’s best interest to continue.    
All subjects are free to withdraw from participation at any time, for any reason, specified or unspecified, and without prejudice.  
Reasonable attempts will be made by the investigator to provide a reason for subject withdrawals.   The reason for the subject ’s withdrawal from the study will be specified in the 
subject’s source documents.   Subjects who withdraw after Visit 2 but prior to Visit 10  will be 
encouraged to come in for a final visit (and the procedures to be followed would include those for their ne xt scheduled visit).    
12.4 Replacement of Subjects  
Subjects who withdraw from the study treatment will be replaced.   
Subjects who withdraw from the study will be replaced.   
13 PROTOCOL VIOLATIONS  
A protocol violation occurs when the subject  or Sponsor -Investigator fails to adhere to 
significant protocol requirements affecting the inclusion, exclusion, subject safety and primary 
endpoint criteria.  Protocol violations for this study include, but are not limited to, the following:  
• Failure to meet inclusion/ exclusion  criteria  
• Use of a prohibited concomitant medication  
• Failure to comply with Good Clinical Practice  (GCP)  guidelines will also result in a protocol 
violation.  The Sponsor -Investigator  will determine if a protocol violation will result in 
withdrawal of a subject.  
When a protocol violation occurs, it will be discussed with the Sponsor -Investigator and a 
Protocol Violation Form detailing the violation will be generated. This form will be signed by a 
Protocol  Number: CLEAR -01 Confidential  
 
Version #: 2.1 Version Date: 5/18/18 Page 29 of 40 
 Sponsor -Investigator.   A copy of the form will be maintained in the  regulatory binder and in the 
Sponsor -Investigator ’s files.  
14 STATISTICAL METHODS AND CONSIDERATIONS  
14.1 Data Sets Analyzed  
All participants who receive the study drug ( D6-25(OH) D3 Solution for Injection) will be 
included in the safety analysis.    
14.2 Demographic and Baseline Characteristics  
The following variables collected at re-screening will be summarized: age, gender, medical 
comorbidities, medications used, height, weight, body mass index, laboratory values (including 
calcium, phosphorus, albumin, vitamin D binding protein, parathyroid hormone, fibroblast 
growth factor -23), and adiposity measured by DXA .   
14.3 Analysis of Primary  Endpoint  
We will compare the distribution of D 6-25(OH) D3 clearance measured during this study to the 
distribution of D 6-25(OH)D 3 clearance measured in the same participants in the unsupplemented 
state during CLEAR or CLEAR -CF. We will use the paired t -test to test differences in these 
distributions. We will u se linear regression with multiplicative interaction terms to explore 
whether CKD or CF modify the D 6-25(OH)D 3 clearance response to vitamin D 3 
supplementation..  
14.4 Analysis of S econdary  Endpoints  
Analyses of secondary endpoints will parallel those of the pri mary endpoint. 
14.5 Interim Analysis  
This is not a clinical trial with an efficacy outcome, and it is neither randomized nor blinded. No formal interim analyses are planned.  
14.6 Sample Size and Randomization  
The sample size of 20 participants gives us excellent power to detect even modest differences in 25(OH)D
3 clearance with vitamin D 3 supplementation. To determine detectable effect sizes 
using a fixed sample size of 20 participants, a pre -post design using the paired t -test, 90% power, 
and a type 1 error rate of 5%, we assumed that the standard deviation of baseline deuterated 25(OH)D
3 clearance observed among our first four actual participants (319, 322, 332, and 431 
mL/day) was the same as that of supplemented clearance. We calculated the minimal detectable differences in deuterated 25(OH)D
3 clearance (i.e. the smallest differences we can detect with 
90% power; power is >90% for larger differences),over a range of correlation for baseline and supplemented clearance (a factor that is unknown). Table 14.1 shows that we can detect differences in clearance that are small compared to the mean value for our first four participants (351 mL/day) and compared to the change in clearance we expect (>50% increase, as per preliminary study reported in Table 2.1).

15 DATA COLLECTION, RETENTION AND 
MONITORING  
15.1 Data Collection Instruments  
The PI  will prepare and maintain adequate and accurate source documents designed to record all observations and other pertinent data for each subject treated with the study drug. Study personnel at each site will enter data from source documen ts corresponding to 
a subject’s visit into the  protocol -specific electronic 
Case Report Form ( eCRF)  when the information 
corresponding to that visit is available.  Subjects will not be identified by name in the study database or on any study documents to be collected by the Sponsor (or designee), but will be identified by a subject number. The Investigator is responsible for all information collected on subjects enrolled in this study.  All data collected during the course of this study must be reviewed and  verified for 
completeness and accuracy by the Investigator.   
15.2 Data Management Procedures  
The data will be entered into a validated database.  Database lock will occur once quality assurance procedures have been completed.  
All procedures for the handling and analysis of data will be conducted using good computing 
practices meeting FDA guidelines for the handling and analysis of data for clinical trials.  
15.3 Data Quality Control and Reporting 
After data have been entered into the study database, a system of com puterized data validation 
checks will be implemented and applied to the database on a regular basis. Queries are entered, 
tracked, and resolved through the EDC system directly.  The study database will be updated in 
accordance with the resolved quer ies.  All changes to the study database will be documented.  
15.4 Archival of Data 
The database is safeguarded against unauthorized access by established security procedures; 
appropriate backup copies of the database and related software files will be maintained.  Data bases are backed up by the database administrator in conjunction with any 
updates or changes to the database.    
At critical junctures of the protocol (e.g., production of interim reports and final reports), data for analysis is locked and cleaned per estab lished procedures.  
15.5 Availability and Retention of Investigational Records  
The PI will make study data accessible to the UW monitor, other authorized representatives of 
the University of Washington IRB, and Regulatory Agency (e.g., FDA) inspectors upon reque st.

The study will be conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki, Protection of Human Volunteers (21 CFR 50), Institutional Review Boards (21 CFR 56), and Obligations of Clinical Investigators (21 CFR 312). 
To maintain confidentiality, all lab oratory specimens, evaluation forms, reports and other records 
will be identified by a coded number and initials only.  All study records will be kept in a locked 
file cabinet and code sheets linking a patient’s name to a patient identification number will  be 
stored separately in another locked file cabinet.  Clinical information will not be released without written permission of the subject, except as necessary for monitoring by the FDA.  The Investigator must also comply with all applicable privacy regula tions (e.g., Health Insurance 
Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, EU Data Protection Directive 95/46/EC).  
16.1 Protocol Amendments  
Any amendment to the protocol will be written by the Investigator -Sponsor.  Protocol 
amendments will not be implement ed wi thout prior submission to FDA and prior written IRB  
approval except as necessary to eliminate immediate safety hazards to patients.  A protocol amendment intended to eliminate an apparent immediate hazard to patients may be implemented immediately, provide d the IRBs are notified within five working days. 
16.2 Institutional Review Boards and Independent Ethics Committees  
The protocol and consent form will be reviewed and approved by the University of Washington Institutional Review Board prior to study initiation.  Serious adverse experiences regardless of 
causality will be reported to the IRB in accordance with the standard operating procedures and policies of the IRB, and the I nvestigator will keep the IRB informed as to the progress of the 
study.  The I nvestigator will obtain assurance of IRB compliance with regulations.  
Protocol  Number: CLEAR -01 Confidential  
 
Version #: 2.1 Version Date: 5/18/18 Page 32 of 40 
 Any documents that the IRB may need to fulfill its responsibilities (such as protocol, protocol 
amendments, Investigator ’s Brochure, consent forms, information concerning patient 
recruitment, payment or compensation procedures, or other pertinent information) will be submitted to the IRB.  The IRB ”s written unconditional approval of the study protocol and the 
informed consent form will be in the possession of the I nvestigator before the study is initiated.  
The IRBs unconditional approval statement will be transmitted by the I nvestigator to the Sponsor 
or designee prior to the shipment of study supplies to the site.  This approval must refer to the study by exact protocol title and number and should identify the documents reviewed and the 
date of review. 
Protocol and/or informed consent modifications or changes may not be initiated without prior 
written IRB approval except when necessary to eliminate immediate hazards to th e patients or 
when the change(s) involves only logistical or administrative aspects of the study.  Such modifications will be submitted to the IRB and written verification that the modification was submitted and subsequently approved should be obtained.   
The IRB must be informed of revisions to other documents originally submitted for review; serious and/or unexpected adverse experiences occurring during the study in accordance with the standard operating procedures and policies of the IRB; new information that may affect adversely the safety of the patients of the conduct of the study; an annual update and/or request for re -approval; and when the study has been completed.  
16.3 Informed Consent Form

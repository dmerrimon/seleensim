Document Version Date Summary of Changes and Rationale
Amendment 6 20 September 2021 The overall rationale for the amendment is to 
permit participants actively  enrolled in the 
C0251002 study  to have the option to continue 
active treatment into a long term open label 
extension study , known as protocol C0251008. 
This study  is An Open Label, Extension Study  
for Study  Participants who have completed the 
full treatment period in one of the qualify ing 
parent studies (eg, protocol C0251002) utilizing 
the PF -06823859 compound in adul t participants 
with Dermatomy ositis. Participants will be 
enrolled per investigator discretion and 
eligibility . If participants do not continue in the 
open label extension study  due to any  reason, 
they will continue into the follow up portion of 
the C0251002 study . 
Added throughout protocol: All participants who 
complete the treatment period in this study  up 
through and including (Visit 9, Week 24), will 
have the opportunit y to continue treatment in the 
open label extension C0251008 p rotocol.  
Participan ts who have completed the treatment 
period and have not had any significant protocol 
deviations, or safet y events will be eligible. 
SOA: Footnote added to Visit 9, Week 24 on the 
amended stage 2 and stage 3.  This footnote was 
added to note that if patien ts are eligible and if 
per the investigator discretion, they  may  enter 
into the long term open lable extension study .
SOA: Amended Stage 2, added hsCRP to the 
early withdraw visit.  
Rationale : To make consistent between 
Stage 3 and Amended Stage 2.
SOA: F or amended Stage 2 and Stage 3, 
collection of height was added at Week 24, 
Visit 9, so that these assessments are completed 
for an yone moving into the open label extension

at Week 24.  Also removed height from the earl y 
termination visits as not needed and to make both 
muscle and skin assessments consistent.
Rationale: Allow participants the opportunity  
to enroll into the open label extension study .  
All pariticipants will have height recorded at 
Week 24.  This will allow the participants 
moving into the open label extension a 
complete baseline.
Section 3.1: Study  Design: 
Added rationale for Amendment 5 and 
Amendment 6; Added that current participants 
upon completing Visit 9, Week 24 will have the 
opportunity  to enroll into an open label extension 
study .

error wa s corrected.
In the SOA for Stage 3, lab assessments for,Viral 
Surveillance (CMV, VZV, EBV, HHV6, 
HSV -1/2) should be collected at Visit 11 and not 
Visit 10. Correction: Please note: An “X” was 
added at Visit 11, and removed from Visit 10.
In the SOA for St age 3, the C- SSRS assessment 
should be collected at the earl y termination visit. 
Correction: An “X” was added at the Earl y 
termination visit for CSSR- S. 
In the SOA for amended study  Stage 2 and 
Stage 3, an “X” was removed from the SOA at

Final Protocol Amendment 6, 20September 2021 
PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL
Page 7was amend edto allow placebo participants the 
opportunity  to receive active study  drug , which 
extended the study  duration for 12 weeks. 
The following sections have been updated:
Cover Page: Added (Eudra CT Number).
Rationale: Study  will be conducted in 
Europe .
Added SOA for Amended Stage 2, and Stage 3 .
Rationale: Study  extended for Amended 
Stage 2and Stage 3. All participants will 
receive 12 weeks active study  drug . This 
will allow placebo pa rticipants to receive 
active treatment during the study .  Stage 3 
SoA: Added a c ohort of 8 -16 
Dermatom yositis participants with moderate 
muscle disease.
Section 1.6 Dose Selection Rationale .
Updated to add additional dosing information for 
Amended Stage 2 and Stage 3 participants. 
Rationale: The published clinical ty peI 
interferon gene signature model for the 
IFNAR1 inhibitor, anifrolumab, was adapted 
to project a gene signature suppression b y 
PF-06823859 in DM pa rticipants. 
Specificall y, the published model was 
modified to include IFN -and a biologically 
relevant mechanism for gene signature 
production and incorporated the PK data 
from C0251001. The modified model 
provided the rationale for doses to be 
considered in treatment of DM pa rticipants
with clinical manifestations of skin dise ase 
andmuscle disease. The efficacious dose 
was defined as the dose required to suppress 
gene signature b y ≥80% in pa rticipants at 
trough for a duration of 4 weeks after the 
third dose in Study  C0251002 (with IV doses 
once every  4weeks for a total of 3 doses).  
Using this approach, the predicted efficacious

Page 30a. Any participant who prematurely withdraws from the treatment period should undergo the procedures for an early termination vis it and return for follow up 
visits.  At the time of the early termination visit, blood samples will be collected for PK and PD analysis.  As with all PK and  PD assessments, the date and 
time of the last dose and time of the sample collection should be captured and reported.
b. Review and collect any changes from screening.
c. The PHQ-8 will be used at the screening visit only.  If the PHQ-8 total score is ≥15 at screening the participant will be excluded from the study.
d.  
 
  
 Section 7.4 .
e. Physician’s Global Assessment (PhGA); This assessment should be completed by the same physician completing the CDAI.
f. Patient reported outcomes (5D Pruritus Scale, SF-36 v2, DLQI) are to be completed at the clinic prior to other clinical assessme nts.  These need to be 
completed in the following order, 5D Pruritus Scale; SF-36 v2; and last DLQI.
g. Vital Signs include blood pressure, heart rate (pulse), respirations and temperature measured after approximately 5 minutes of  rest.  Participants should be 
seated in a chair, back supported, and arms bared (free of restrictions such as rolled-up sleeves, etc) and supported at the le vel of the heart.  Measurements 
should be taken on the same arm (preferably the non-dominant arm) at each visit throughout the study after 5 minutes of rest and  recorded to the nearest 
mm Hg.  Participants should refrain from smoking or ingesting caffeine during the 30 minutes prior to the measurements. 
h. Weight and height will be measured without shoes. i. Complete PE consists of general appearance, skin, HEENT, heart, lungs, breast (optional), abdomen, external genitalia optiona l, extremities, neurologic 
function, back, and lymph nodes.  Targeted PE consists of skin, heart, lungs, abdomen, and examination of body systems where th ere are symptom 
complaints by the participant.  Targeted physical exam should be completed prior to dosing.
j. Chest x-ray; or other appropriate diagnostic image already collected (ie, CT scan with or without contrast or MRI) may be acc epted if completed within 
12 weeks prior to Day 1).  Official reading must be located in the source documentation.
k. Refer to lab manual for preparation of punch skin biopsies.l. Laboratory tests may be repeated once during the 5-week screening period; the last value will be used to determine participan t eligibility.
m. Serum/urine pregnancy tests for WOCBP; serum pregnancy test must be performed at screening for all WOCBP as defined in the el igibility criteria (if serum 
pregnancy test is borderline positive, the central laboratory will run a FSH test to confirm menopause if the participant has mi ssed her periods <12 months); 
urine pregnancy test must be performed at baseline for all WOCBP prior to dosing with investigational product and at all subseq uent visits.
n. In addition to time points specified, a blood sample for viral surveillance may also be taken at the time of an AE, as clinic ally appropriate.
o. Confirmation and documentation of negative HIV test result within 3 months prior to screening is acceptable. p. Additional TB testing is allowed at any time if requested by the Investigator, the Sponsor and/or if there is a suspicion of TB reactivation or new TB 
infection.  The following are acceptable IGRA assays: In-Tube test (QFT-GIT), and QuantiFERON
®-TB Gold test, (QFT-G).
q.
r. Participants who experience AEs which are considered attributable to immunogenicity and have ADA will be requested to return for additional follow-up for 
up to 3 months after the follow-up/EOS visit and will have PK and ADA samples drawn for analysis.  This will be recorded as an u nscheduled visit.CCI

receive 12 weeks of active study drug, and provide 2 additional skin biopsies at Week 24. Study participation is approximately 45 weeks in duration, including the screening period. 
The schedule of activities table provides an overview of the protocol visits and procedures.  Refer to the STUDY PROCEDURES and 
ASSESSMENTS sections of the protocol for detailed information on each procedure and assessment required for compliance with the 
protocol. The investigator may schedule visits (unplanned visits) in addition to those listed on the schedule of activities tab le, in order 
to conduct evaluations or assessments required to protect the well-being of the participant.

f. Patient reported outcomes (PtGA, HAQ-DI, 5-D Pruritus Scale, , SF 36 v2 acute, DLQI, and EQ-5D-5L & EQ-VAS) are to be 
completed at the clinic prior to other clinical assessments.  These need to be completed in the following order, PtGA, HAQ-DI, 5-D Pruritus Scale,  
, SF 36 v2 acute, DLQI, EQ-5D-5L & EQ-VAS.
g. Vital Signs include blood pressure, heart rate (pulse), respirations and temperature measured after approximately 5 minutes of  rest.  Participants should be 
seated in a chair, back supported, and arms bared (free of restrictions such as rolled-up sleeves, etc.) and supported at the l evel of the heart.  Measurements 
should be taken on the same arm (preferably the non-dominant arm) at each visit throughout the study after 5 minutes of rest and  recorded to the nearest 
mm Hg.  Participants should refrain from smoking or ingesting caffeine during the 30 minutes prior to the measurements. 
h. Weight and height will be measured without shoes.i. Complete PE consists of general appearance, skin, HEENT, heart, lungs, breast (optional), abdomen, external genitalia optional,  extremities, neurologic 
function, back, and lymph nodes. Targeted PE consists of skin, heart, lungs, abdomen, and examination of body systems where ther e are symptom 
complaints by the participant.  Targeted physical exam should be completed prior to dosing.
j. Chest x-ray; or other appropriate diagnostic image already collected (ie, CT scan with or without contrast or MRI) may be acce pted if completed within 
12 weeks prior to Day 1). Official reading must be located in the source documentation.
k. Refer to lab manual for preparation of punch skin biopsies. There is a -6 day screening window at Day 1 for punch biopsies.  A t Week 12 and Week 24, a -/+ 
6 day window is permitted to obtain skin punch biopsies. 
l. Laboratory tests may be repeated once during the 5-week screening period; the last value will be used to determine participan t eligibility.
m. Serum/urine pregnancy tests for WOCBP; serum pregnancy test must be performed at screening for all WOCBP as defined in the el igibility criteria (if serum 
pregnancy test is borderline positive, the central laboratory will run a FSH test to confirm menopause if the participant has mi ssed her periods <12 months); 
urine pregnancy test must be performed at baseline for all WOCBP prior to dosing with investigational product and at all subseq uent visits.
n. In addition to time points specified, a blood sample for viral surveillance may also be taken at the time of an AE, as clinic ally appropriate.
o. Confirmation and documentation of negative HIV test result within 3 months prior to screening is acceptable.
p. Additional TB testing is allowed at any time if requested by the Investigator, the Sponsor and/or if there is a suspicion of TB reactivation or new TB 
infection.  The following are acceptable IGRA assays: In-Tube test (QFT-GIT), and QuantiFERON

neuromuscular disease and an autoimmune disease.  DM is characterized by a distinctive skin rash and muscle weakness or inflamed muscles. Symptoms can come on suddenly or gradually over time. It is thought that the inflammation resulting in cell damage is created when the immune system attacks healthy muscle tissue and blood vessels under the skin.  DM is idiopathic, however some individuals may have a genetic predisposition that is triggered by medications, viruses, bacteria, trauma, toxins, cancer or other illness. DM symptoms often wax and wane for no apparent reason and females are affected twice as often as males.
1,2
DM has no known cure and there are no widely approved treatments.  Patients typically use a 
combination of drugs to seek relief for their inflammatory symptoms.  Typically the first line of treatment for the muscle disease is corticosteroids to address the inflammation as well as suppress the immune system. Other immunosuppressive drugs, notably azathioprine, methotrexate, mycophenolate mofetil, (MMF), and cyclophosphamide are used as subsequent lines of therapies in refractory cases or as steroid-sparing agents.  However, complications of long-term steroid and immunosuppressive therapies are well documented.  Other novel approaches have emerged as potential treatment, including tacrolimus (broadly immunosuppressive drug developed for transplant use), intravenous immunoglobulin, and rituximab, following positive outcomes in some case studies.  However, additional randomized controlled trials with these treatments are needed to guide clinical practice.
3
Consequently, DM remains a disease with very high unmet medical need, and development of safe and effective therapies is warranted. 
1.1. Mechanism of Action/Indication
PF-06823859 is a potent, selective, humanized immunoglobulin G1(IgG1) neutralizing 
antibody directed against the human soluble cytokine interferon-beta (IFN β), a member of 
the type I interferon (IFN) family of cytokines.  PF-06823859 is in development for the treatment systemic lupus erythematous (SLE) with added potential for therapeutic benefit in DM.

1.3. Nonclinical Pharmacokinetics 
After single intravenous (IV) doses of PF-06823859 at 10 and 200 mg/kg administered to 
cynomolgus monkeys, serum exposures were typical for an IgG1 monoclonal antibodies,(mAb) dosed to monkeys.  The mean plasma clearance (CL) ranged from 0.00439 to 0.00502 L/day/kg, the mean volume at steady state (V
ss) ranged from 0.0747 to 0.0823 L/kg, 
and the mean apparent half-life ranged from 11.4 to 14.0 days.  Subcutaneous (SC) bioavailability was approximately 87% following a single 10 mg/kg dose of PF-06823859.  The pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles of PF-06823859 in the cynomolgus monkey were typical for a human IgG mAb in monkeys.  In the pi votal repeat dose monkey toxicity study with
20 mg/kg SC, 100 mg/kg SC or 500 mg/kg IV doses of PF-06823859, there were no apparent sex-related- differences observed in systemic exposure.  Systemic exposures were higher on Day 85 compared to Day 1 for all dose groups, and exposures increased with increasing dose in the SC dose groups.  The incidence of Anti-Drug Antibody (ADA) induction across all dose groups administered PF-06823859 via either repeat IV or SC dosing in cynomolgus monkeys was 36%. 
Additional information for this compound may be found in the single reference safety 
document (SRSD), which for this study is the Investigator’s Brochure (IB).
1.4. Nonclinical Safety Data
In the in vitro Fc receptor (FcR) and complement protein C1q binding assays, PF-06832859 
did not bind to C1q, suggesting an inability to activate the classical complement pathway and induce complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC), and the FcR binding data demonstrated that PF-06823859 had low potential to elicit antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity(ADCC) activity.  PF-06823859 did not elicit test article-related release of 3 human pro 
inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor alpha, (TNF α), Interleukin 6, (IL6), and 
Interferon gamma, (IFN γ) in the in vitro soluble phase cytokine release assay.  PF-06823859 
did not cause suppression of the influenza antigen-specific proliferative response in the human lymphocyte activation (HuLA) assay.  In the herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) assay, incubation of human dermal fibroblasts with PF-06823859 resulted in a dose dependent 
inhibition of IFN β-mediated suppression of HSV-1 replication.  In the good laboratory 
practice (GLP) compliant tissue cross-reactivity  study, staining patterns with PF-06823859 
overlapped between cynomolgus and human tissues, with some exceptions primarily in epithelial subtypes.  The majority of staining observed was cytoplasmic, which is not expected to be accessible to the test article in vivo. CCI

Page 47Based on binding and functional assessments across species (i e,mice, rats, rabbits, & 
cynomolgus monkey s), the only  pharmacologically  relevant species for toxicity  testing is the 
cynomolgus monkey .  In a GL P-compliant toxicity  study , PF-06823859 was not associated 
with an y adverse test article -related findings when administered to sexually -mature male and 
female cy nomolgus monkey s once weekl y via IV orSC routes up to 500 mg/kg/dose for up 
to 14 weeks.  There were no test article -related effects on the cardiovascular sy stem based on 
electrocardiogra phy and heart rate evaluations , nor were there an y test -article related effects 
in male or female reproductive tissues evaluated in the repeat- dose toxicity study  in 
sexually -mature cy nomolgus monkey s. 
Compared with baseline, te st article -related, nonadverse increases in serum globulin and 
subsequent nonadverse decreases in albumin:globulin ratio were noted on Day s29 and 92 in 
animals administered 500 mg/kg/dose (IV).  This increase in serum globulin was attributed to 
the presen ce of high concentrations of PF- 06823859 (an immunoglobulin) and was no longer 
present at the end of the 8-week recovery  phase, consistent with the low concentrations of 
PF-06823859 in the serum at this time.  The n o observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) i n 
this 14 week GL P-compliant repeat -dose toxicity  study  was 500 mg/kg/dose (IV) . In the 
500mg/kg/dose group (IV), the mean serum concentration maximum, ( Cmax) (males and 
females combined) was 25,600 µ g/mL and the mean area under the curve, ( AUC )168(males 
and females combined) was 2,430,000 µg•h/mL on Day 85(Week 13).  The mean average 
concentration ( Cav) was 14,500 µg/mL .  There were no sex -related differences in systemic 
exposure.  In conclusion, the nonclinical safety profile of PF -06823859 has been adequatel y
characterized in vitro and in vivo in cynomolgus monkey to support progression into clinical
trials up to 3 months in duration.

1.5.Clinical Safety Profile
1.5.1. Safety (FIH C0251001)
A first in human (FIH) study , C0251001, (Phase 1, Randomized, Double -Blind, Third -Party  
Open Placebo -Controlled, Dose Escalating Study to Evaluate the Safet y, Tolerability , 
Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacod ynamics of Single and Multiple Intravenous and 
Subcutaneous Doses of PF- 06823859 in Healthy  Participant s) has currently  completed all 
dosing with all participants in the follow -up period of the study  and expected to complete in 
August 2017.  This study consisted of a total of 8 dosing cohorts.  There were 5 cohorts of 
single 30 mg IV, 100 mg IV, 300 mg IV, 900 mg IV and 2000 mg IVdoses .  The last 
3cohorts were multiple dose cohorts consisting of 100 mg x 3 subcu taneous (SC) doses 
(one dose every  2weeks), 300 mg x 3 SC doses, ( one dose every  2 weeks).  The last cohort 
evaluated 2dosing regimens due to a longer than expected half -life based on emerging data
from the preceding cohorts.  Th islast cohort consisted of 600 mg IV x 3 doses ( one dose 
every  2weeks) and 600 mg IV x 2 doses (one dose every  4weeks). 
PF-06823859
C0251002Final Protocol Amendment 6, 20 September 2021 
PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL
Page 48As of 07 April 2017, a total of 48 participants have received at least one dose of 
PF-06823859.  Preliminary data from this study suggest that PF-06823859 is generally well tolerated and safe  
 The most common adverse events were upper respiratory 
tract infection and headache.  These adverse events were generally mild and resolved without further intervention.  No serious adverse event, (AE) or death occurred during the study.
One participant experienced an injection site reaction (ISR) after each of the 100 mg SC 
dosing with PF-06823859 (3 doses) administered every 2 weeks.  These were characterized by mild localized erythema with induration and tenderness, but no signs or symptoms of a systemic reaction.  These local reactions resolved without further intervention within a few days.  This participant also had treatment-induced ADA, which had returned to baseline at the time of discharge ( Section 1.5.3 ).
Overall, there was no apparent difference in the total rate of adverse events between the 
participants treated with the active investigational product (IP) compared to placebo and no apparent dose relationship with the doses of the IP.  However, the rate of mild upper respiratory tract infection appears to be higher in participants treated with PF-06823859.
There were no clinically significant changes in electrocardiogram (ECG), vital signs or 
laboratory abnormalities. 
In conclusion, PF-06823859 was generally well tolerated and safe in healthy participants and 
the preliminary data from this FIH study supports continued clinical development of PF-06823859.  Further details are provided in the current PF-06823859 Investigator’s Brochure.

1.5.3. Immunogenicity Results for C0251001
Note the data analysis provided in this section is based on preliminary immunogenicity data.  
A tiered approach for screening, characterization and Anti-Drug Antibody (ADA) titer assessment of serum samples was adopted to characterize immunogenicity.  As of 07 April2017, the treatment related overall ADA incidence rate was 12% (5 of 43 participants).  Following PF-06823859 administration, 3 adult healthy participants in the single dose groups(2 in 30 mg IV group and 1 in 900 mg IV group) and 2 participants in repeat dose groups (1 in 100 mg SC and 1 in 300 mg SC) were found to have treatment-related ADA responses. The ADA positive participant in 100 mg SC repeat dose group had injection site reaction after each of the 3 doses.  None of the other participants experienced clinical signs or symptoms consistent with an immune response.  The ADA titer in all 5 participants had returned to baseline at the time of discharge and did not result in a discernible impact on PK.  Currently, neutralizing antibody (NAb) assay is under development.
1.5.4. Summary of Benefits and Risks
Based on the clinical data from the FIH study (C0251001) and the available non-clinical 
data, the risks and potential benefits for PF-06823859 are considered to be favorable and support continued clinical development in particpants with DM.
As previously noted, DM is a rare disease with higher prevalence in females than males.  
Therefore, the trial objectives cannot be met without inclusion of women of childbearing potential (WoCBP).  Nonclinical data to date ( Section 1.4 ) has not identified any risk to 
reproductive organs in sexually mature cynomolgus monkeys, the pharmacologically relevant species.  Given that an enhanced pre- and postnatal development study (ePPND) will be conducted later in development, this protocol that allows enrollment of Women of child 
bearing potential, (WoCBP) has stringent requirements to mitigate unintended exposures 
(pregnancy testing and use of contraceptives). 
There is a theoretical risk that alterations in bone may occur based on published observations 
of osteopenia in mice genetically deficient in IFNb.
10The potential for bone effects was 
assessed in the 3-month good laboratory practice (GLP) toxicity study in sexually mature 
cynomolgus monkeys, and there were no microscopic findings in bone, nor alterations in circulating bone-related biomarkers. However, the potential for bone effects in developing/growing bones has not been specifically assessed in growing animals. This riskis considered to be low given the lack of observe d effects in the (GLP) toxicity study as well 
as the limited duration of total exposure to PF-06823859 in this planned DM study.  While CCI

participants in the ICD.
1.6. Dose Selection Rationale
 
A formal interim analysis occurred in April 2020 by an unblinded internal review committee 
independent from the blinded study team.  An internal decision was made to add anadditional dose,   None of the blinded study team members were involved with the data or the decision made at the time of the interim analysis.  In stage 2, following the interim analysis, participants will be randomly assigned to receive that will be administered intravenously  
 4 weeks, for a total of 3 doses.  
All participants enrolled in the Amended Stage 2 of the study will receive active study drug
with the fixed sequence design.  Participants will be randomly assigned to receive  
every 4 weeks.  
Participants who start the study on  will have a prespecified dose change to placebo at Week 12, and participants who are on placebo will have a prespecified dose change to active study drug at Week 12. Participants will thus 
 
during the treatment period.
Stage 3 participants will be randomly assigned to receive  with the fixed 
sequence design. Participants who start the study on active study drug will have a prespecified dose change to placebo at Week 12, and participants who are on placebo will have a prespecified dose change to active study drug at Week 12. Participants will thus receive 3 consecutive doses of and 3 consecutive doses of placebo for a total of 6 doses during the treatment period.  Doses will be administered intravenously over one hour every 4 weeks.
PK and PK/PD approaches were considered using the data available to date to guide selection 
of the proposed dose and dose regimen.

3.1. Study OverviewStage 1 was a multi-center Phase 2A study planned to be conducted in approximately 
30 adult participants with moderate to severe DM.  Thirty two participants were randomized in order to collect data from 24 participants who completed the study.  Each participant was to take part in the study for a period of approximately 9 months.  After the 35 day screening period, participants who were eligible enrolled into the study and were randomized in a blinded manner, 2:1 (Active:Placebo) ratio.  Investigational drug or placebo administration took place on Day 1, Week 4 and Week 8 of the study.  Participants then entered a 5-month follow-up period. 
In Stage 2, with the addition of 1 lower dose arm, this study then became a  
 
Participants will receive study drug, (active or placebo) on 
Day 1, Week 4, (Visit 4), and Week 8, (Visit 5).  At Week 12, (Visit 6) is the scheduled primary endpoint of the study.  
The study was further amended, and Stage 2 became “Amended Stage 2” changing the study
to a fixed sequence design. In this design participants will be randomized to a treatment sequence at Day 1. The treatment sequence (Active -> Placebo or Placebo ->Active) will dictate whether the participant will receive active study drug during Day 1 to Week 12 or active study drug during Week 12 to Week 20. Although dosing is completed at Week 20, the treatment period goes through to Week 24. There is no washout in between the dose changes (Day 1 to Week 12 and Week 12 to Week 20) for this design. Another key feature is that this design will allow placebo subjects to receive active treatment at some timepoint during the study. No re-randomization will occur at Week 12.  Participants who start the study on active study drug will have a prespecified dose change to placebo at Week 12, and participants who are on placebo will have a prespecified dose change to active study drug at Week 12.  The placebo participants will receive prespecifieddoses of either , in order to maintain equal distribution of these doses.
There will be no unblinding or interruption of dosing during the treatment period.  Each 
participant will receive 3 consecutive doses of active study drug and 3 consecutive doses of placebo during the trial. The dose change between active and placebo in this fixed sequence design will provide each participant 12 weeks of active drug.  The participant, study doctor, or sponsor will not know what the participant is assigned to during the treatment period. The end of the treatment period is at Week 24, although the last dose is administered at the Week 20 visit (Visit 8).  All participants will then enter a 4 month follow-up period (the interval between the last dose and the end of the follow-up period is 5 months). 
Participants who entered Stage 2 prior to Amendment 4 will follow the design and SoA of 
Amendment 3, which is Stage 2. Statistical analyses including Stage 2 endpoints will involve data from the original Stage 2 of Amendment 3 and the Amended Stage 2 ofAmendment 4, as appropriate.CCI

muscle involvement (MMT-8 ≤ 136/150) will be enrolled. This cohort is referred to as 
Stage 3.Participants in this cohort are allowed to have an y amount of skin involvement, as
no specific CDASI score is required. All participants who meet eligibility  criteria for 
(Stage 3) will be randomized to receive either PF -06823859 600 mg active study  drug or 
placebo. This study  design is similar to the Amended Stage 2 as all participants will receive 
their dosing assignment at Day 1 in a fixed sequence manner for the duration of the treatment 
period. The treatment period will consist of 6 dosing’s occurring at Day  1, Week 4, ( Visit4), 
Week 8, (Visit 5), Week 12 (Visit 6), Week 16 (Visit 7) ,and Week 20, (Visit 8).  Each 
participant will receive 3 consecutive doses of active study  drug and 3 consecutive doses of 
placebo. At Week 12 (Visit 6),participants will be switched to the opposite treatment arm 
from what they  were randomly  assigned to at Day 1, Week 4 and W eek 8. The  study  design 
permits all partic ipants to receive active stud y drug in a blinded manner. The dose change 
between active and placebo will provide each participant 12 weeks of active drug.  The end 
of the treatment period is at Week 24, although the last dose is administered at the Week 20 
visit (Visit 8).  All participants will then enter a 4 month follow -up period (the int erval 
between the last dose and the end of the follow -up period is 5 months). 
If a participant meets eligibility  criteria for both Amended Stage 2 and Stage 3 , the 
participant will be enrolled in Stage 3 unless the enrollment maximum for Stage 3 has been 
reached, at which point the participant would enroll in the Amended Stage 2 .
Amendment 5 contained updates specific to Germany  only. German y is following the 
contraceptive guidelines related to CTFG guidelines, see Appendix 24.
Amendment 6; participants currentl y active in the C0251002 study  at the time the open label 
extension study  (C0251008 )is approved, will have the opportunity  toreceive 24 additional 
weeks of treatment.  Study participants will be eligible if they  have completed the treatment 
period up through and including Visit 9, Week 24 and have not had any  significant protocol 
deviations, or safet y events. The participant c an also select to continue into the follow up 
period of the C0251002 study  for completion instead of enrolling into open label extension 
C0251008.  
The overall duration of the C0251002 study  will be approximately  69months from first 
subject first visit, (FSFV )to last subject last visit, ( LSLV ) and will be conducted at 
approximately  35-40 investigative sites. Overall, approximately  76participants will be 
randomized into this study.

Page 814.8.2. Contraception
Studies to evaluate the development toxicity  of PF -06823859 have not been conducted.   
Therefore, the use of a highl y effective method of contraception is required (see Appendix 25
and study  sites participating in Germa ny please see Appendix 24).
The investigator or his or her designee, in consultation with the participant, will confirm that 
the participant has selected an appropria te method of contraception for the individual 
participant and his or her partner(s) from the permitted list of contraception methods (see 
Appendix 25and study  sites from German y see Appendix 24) and will confirm that the 
participant has been instructed in its consistent and correct use. At time points indicated in 
the SoA , the investigator or designee will inform the participant of the need to use highl y 
effective contraception consistently  and correctly  and document the conversation and the 
participant’s affirmation in the participant’s chart (part icipants need to affirm their consistent 
and correct use of at least 1 of the selected methods of contraception) considering that their 
risk for pregnancy  may  have changed since the last visit. In addition, the investigator or 
designee will instruct the p articipant to call immediately  if the selected contraception method 
is discontinued or if pregnancy  is known or suspected in the participant or partner.
In German y, CTFG guidelines will be followed, where one highly  effective method of 
contraception must be used, see Appendix 24. The investigator will document the 
conversation, and the participant’s affirmation, in the participant’s chart.  
4.9.Sponsor ’sQualified Medical Personnel
The contact information for the sponsor's appropriately qualified medical personnel for the 
study  is documented in the study  contact list located in Study  Team on Demand (STOD), 
STOD@pfizer.com . 
To facilitate access to appropriatel y qualified medical personnel on study -related medical 
questions or problems, participant s are provided with a contact card.   The contact card 
contains, at a minimum, protocol and investigational product identifiers, participant study  
numbers, contact information for the investigat orsite, and contact details for a contact center 
in the event that the investigat orsite staff cannot be reached to provide advice on a medical 
question or problem originating from another healthcare professional not involved in the 
participant ’s participation in the study .The contact number can also be used by  investiga tor
staff if they  are seeking advice on medical questions or problems; however, it should be used
only in the event that the established communication pathway s betwe en the investigator site 
and the study  team are not available. It is therefore intended to augment, but not replace, the 
established communication pathway s between the investigator site and the study  team for 
advice on medical questions or problems that m ay arise during the stud y.  The contact 
number is not intended for use b y the participant directly , and if a participant calls that 
number, he or she will be directed back to the investigat orsite.

Page 825.STUDY TREATMENTS
For the purposes of this study , and per International Conference on Harmoni sation ( ICH)
guidelines ,investigational product is defined as a pharmaceutical form of an active 
ingredient or placebo being tested or used as a reference /comparator in a clinical trial, 
including a product with a marketing authorization when used or assembled (formulated or 
packaged) in a way  different from the approved form, or when used for an unapproved 
indication, or when used to gain further information about an approved use (ICH E6 1.33).
For this study , the investigational product will be administered intravenously over 
approximately one hour.  I nvestigational product will be administered every  4weeks , each 
participant receiving 3 doses of investigational pr oduct .
5.1.Allocation to Treatment
Allocation of participants to treatment/ or placebo will proceed through the use of an 
interactive r esponse technology  (IRT) system or (interactive Web -based response [ IWR].  
Theblinded personnel will be required to enter or select information including but not 
limited to the user’s identification ( ID)and password, the protocol number andthe 
participant number.  The blinded person will then be provided with a randomization numb er, 
and dispensable unit (DU) or container number when investigational product is being 
supplied via the I RTsystem .  It is noted that a ll of the information shown in the IRT system 
during drug assignment, and on the relevant confirmation report, is blinde d information.  The 
IRT s ystem will provide a confirmation report containing the participant number , 
randomization number , and DU or container number assigned.
The study  specific IRT reference manual will provide the contact information and further 
details on the use of the IRT system .
5.2.Breaking the Blind
This study  will be double blinded, (Sponsor, I nvestigator and participant will all be and 
remain blinded throughout the duration of the study ). An interim anal ysismay be conducted 
for internal dec ision making. An internal review committee, (I RC) separate from the blinded 
study  team will review safety  and efficacy  data.
At the initiation of the study , the investigator site will be instructed on the method for 
breaking the blind.  The method will b e an electronic process.  Blinding codes are able to be 
broken in exceptional circumstances when knowledge of the actual treatment code is 
absolutely  essential for further management of the participant . If the situation allows, 
investigators are encourage d to discuss with the sponsor’s medical monitor if they  believe 
unblinding is necessary , however, under no circumstances should unblinding be delay ed in 
an emergency  situation . When the blinding code is broken, the reason must be fully  
documented and ente red on the case report form (CRF).
5.3. Participant Compliance
All doses of investigational product will be administered by  the appropriately  designated 
study  staff at the investigator site.

Once eligibility has been confirmed through the screening period process, each participant 
will be randomized. The investigational product will be dispensed using an interactive response technology, (IRT) drug management system at each dispensing visit. A qualified staff member will dispense the investigational product via unique container numbers on the label provided, in quantities appropriate for the dose assignment.
See the IP manual for instructions on how to prepare the investigational product for 
administration. Investigational product should be prepared and dispensed by an appropriately qualified and experienced member of the study staff (eg, physician, nurse, physician’s assistant, nurse practitioner, pharmacy assistant/technician, or pharmacist) as allowed by local, state, and institutional guidance. 
PF-06823859 doses and placebo will be prepared by qualified unblinded site personnel 
according to the IP manual. The investigational product will be administered to participantsin a blinded manner.

over the course of  
 has completed, all participants will be monitored for an additional 
60 minutes post investigational treatment administration.
5.5.1. Infusion Discontinuation
•If a participant experiences symptoms typical of an allergic reaction, the study drug 
administration should be discontinued immediately and permanently. 
•If a participant experiences symptoms typical of infusion reactions 
(eg, lightheadedness, nausea, chills, fever), the study drug infusion should be stopped.  At the discretion of the investigator, the infusion can be restarted at a slower rate if symptoms are resolved within 1 hour after the stop of infusion.  If symptoms return, CCI

5.6.Invest igational Product Storage 
The investigator, or an approved representative, e g,pharmacist, will ensure that all 
investigational products are stored in a secured area with controlled access under required 
storage conditions and in accordance with applicabl e regulatory  requirements. 
Investigational product should be stored in its original container and in accordance with the 
label . 
See the IP manual for complete information on storage conditions, handling and stability of 
the product. 
Any storage conditio ns stated in the single reference safet y document (SRSD) 
(eg,Investigator’s Brochure [IB]) will be superseded by  the storage conditions stated on the 
product label. 
Site sy stems must be capable of measuring and documenting (for example, via a log), at a 
minimum, daily  minimum and maximum temperatures for all site storage locations (as 
applicable, including frozen, refrigerated, and/or room temperature products).  This should be 
captured from the time of investigational product receipt throughout the study .  Even for 
continuous monitoring systems, a log or site procedure that ensures dail y evaluation for 
excursions should be available.  The intent is to ensure that the minimum and maximum 
temperature is checked each business day  to confirm that no excursion occurred since the last 
evaluation and to provide the site with the capability  to store or view the minimum/maximum 
temperature for a ll nonworking days upon return to normal operations.  The operation of the 
temperature monitoring device and storage unit (for example, refrigerator), as applicable, 
should be regularl y inspected to ensure it is maintained in working order. 
Any excursions from the product label storage conditions should be reported to Pfizer upon 
discovery .  The site should actively  pursue options for returning the product to the storage 
conditions as described in the labeling, as soon as possible.  Deviations from the storage 
requirements, including any actions taken, must be documented and reported to Pfizer. 
Once an excursion is identified, the investigational product must be quarantined and not used 
until Pfizer provides documentation of permission to use the investiga tional product.  It will 
not be considered a protocol deviation if Pfizer approves the use of the investigational 
product after the temperature excursion.  Use of the investigational product prior to Pfizer
approval will be considered a protocol deviation.  Specific details regarding information the 
site should report for each excursion will be provided to the site.

The investiga torsite must maintain adequate records documenting the receipt, use, loss, or 
other disposition of the investigational product supplies.  All investigational products will be 
accounted for using a drug accountabilit y form/record.
5.7.1. Destruction of Investigational Product Supplies 
The sponsor or designee will provide guidance on the destruction of un used investigational 
product ( eg,at the site). If destruction is authorized to take place at the investigator site, the 
investigator must ensure thatthe materials are destroy ed in compliance with applicable 
environmental regulations, institutional policy , and any  special instructions provided by  
Pfizer ,and all destruction must be adequatel y documented.
All used glass vials should be maintained at the investigative site for accountability .  The 
investigator will maintain the unused supply until dest ruction is authorized. Pfizer will

All concomitant treatments including corticosteroids or equivalent taken during the stud y 
must be recorded in study records with indication for use, total dail y dose, and start and stop 
dates of administration. 
5.8.6. Guidance for Investigators
During the course of the study , those participant who experience a severe flare requiring new 
or increased doses of immunosuppressant s(including new or increased dose s of 
corticosteroids bey ond what is permitted or hospitalization ), will be discontinued from the 
treatment period of the study  and placed in the follow -up period, and therefore, will receive 
no further investigational product. Rescue therap y may be admini stered as clinically  
necessary . 
5.9.Rescue Medication 
After a participant enters the follow up period, or prematurel y withdrawn from the study for 
any reason, medicall y necessary treatments for DM will be allowed.   The previous prohibited 
medications will no longer appl y.
6. STUDY PROCEDURES 
6.1.Screening
Forscreening procedures, seeSchedule of Activities and ASSESSM ENTS section.
Participants will be screened within 35 days prior to administration of investigational product 
to confirm that they  meet the participant eligibility criteria for the stud y.  The inv estigator (or 
appropriate delegate at the investigator site) will obtain informed consent from each 
participant in accordance with the procedures described in Section 12.3.  Screening visits 
may occur over multiple visits to achieve all of the required testing.
Screening laboratory  tests with abnormal results may  be repeated once to confirm abnormal 
results.  T he lastvalue (most recent value obtained) will be used to determine eligibility .  If 
results return to normal within the 5-week screening period, the participant may enter the 
study . 
Rescreening:
Participants who do not meet the eligibility  criteria ( ie,screen failure) may  be re -screened 
once at a later date.  An y participant who is re -screened must be re- consented and receive a 
new participant number.  All activities required for the screening visit must be repeated.

Page 96It may  be appropriate for the participant to return to the clinic for final safety  assessments to 
be scheduled as early  as practicall y feasible following the decision to withdraw from the 
study .  Participants should be questioned regarding their reason for withdrawal.  At the early  
withdrawal vis it, every  effort must be made to complete the assessments according to the 
early withdraw visit in the SOA . The site should follow the applicable SOA the participant
has been following during their participati on in the study . 
Lack of completion of all or an y of the earl y termination procedures will not be viewed as 
protocol deviations so long as the participant safety  was preserved.
Withdrawal of consent
Participants who request to discontinue receipt of study treatment will remain in the study  
and must continue to be followed for protocol specified follow -up procedures. The onl y 
exception to this is when a participant specificall y withdraws consent for any further contact 
with him or her or persons previously authorized by the participant to provide this 
information. Participant s should notify  the investigator in writing of the decision to 
withdraw consent from future follow- up, whenever possible. The withdrawal of consent 
should be explained in detail in th e medical records by  the investigator, as to whether the 
withdrawal is only  from further receipt of investigational product or also from study  
procedures and/or post treatment study  follow -up, and entered on the appropriate CRF page. 
In the event that vital status (whether the participant is alive or dead) is being measured, 
publicly  available information should be used to determine vital status only as appropriately  
directed in accordance with local law.
Lost to f ollow -up: 
All reasonable efforts must be made to locate participant s to determine and report their 
ongoing status. This includes follow- up with persons authorized by  the participant as noted 
above. Lost to follow -up is defined by  the inability  to reach the participant after a minimum 
of 2documented phone calls, faxes, or e -mails as well as lack of response by  the participant
to 1registered mail letter. All attempts should be documented in the participant ’s medical 
records. If it is determined that the participant has died, the site will use locally  permissible 
methods to obtain the date and cause of death. If the investigator’s use of a third- party 
representative to assist in the follow- up portion of the study  has been included in the 
participant ’s informed consent, then the investigato r may  use a sponsor -retained third- party 
representative to assist site staff with obtaining the participant ’s contact information or other 
public vital status data necessary  to complete the follow -up portion of the study . The site 
staff and representative will consult publicly  available sources, such as public health 
registries and databases, in order to obtain updated contact information. If, after all attempts, 
the participant remains lost to follow -up, then the last -known- alive date as determined by  the 
investigator should be reported and documented in the participant ’s medical records.

Page 97Participant s may  withdraw from the study  at an y time at their own request, or they  may  be 
withdrawn at an y time at the discretion of the investigator or sponsor for safety (see also the 
Withdrawal From the Study  Due to Adverse Events section) or behavioral reasons, or the 
inability  of the participant to comply  with the protocol -required schedule of study  visits or 
procedures at a given study  site.
If a participant does not return for a scheduled visit, every  effort should be made to contact 
the participant . The Investigator or designee should attempt to contact the participant twice.  
After two attempts, stud y site staff may  send a registered letter.  If no response is received 
from the participant , the participant will be considered lost to follow up.  All attempts to 
contact the participant and information received during contact attempts must be documented 
in the participant ’s medical record.  In an y circumstance, every  effort should be made to 
document participant outcome, if possible.  The investigator should inquire about the reason 
for withdrawal, request that the participant return for a final visit, if applicable, and f ollow -up 
with the participant regarding an y unresolved adverse events (AEs).
If the participant withdraws from the study , and also withdraws consent for disclosure of 
future information, no further evaluations should be performed, and no additional data sh ould 
be collected.  The sponsor may  retain and continue to use any  data collected before such 
withdrawal of consent.
Participants wh o withdraw from the study  may  be replaced at the discretion of the 
investigator upon consultation with the sponsor. 
7.ASSESSM ENTS
Every  effort should be made to ensure that the protocol -required tests and procedures are 
completed as described. However ,it is anticipated that from time to time there may  be 
circumstances outside of the control of the investigator that may  make it unfeasible to 
perform the test. In these cases the investigator will take all steps necessar y to ensure the 
safet y and well -being of the participant . When a protocol -required test cannot be performed ,
the investigator will document the reason for this and any  corrective and preventive actions 
that he or she has taken to ensure that normal processes are adhered to as soon as poss ible.
The study  team will be informed of these incidents in a timely  manner .
For samples being collected and shipped, detailed collection, processing, storage, and 
shipment instructions and contact information will be provided to the investigator site pri or 
to initiation of the study .
7.1.Photography
During the study , photographic images may  be taken of the participant’s skin. The

Page 987.2. Pregnancy Testing
All pregnancy tests used in this study, either urine or serum, must have a sensitivity of at 
least 5 mlU/ml and must be performed by a certified laboratory.  For female participants of childbearing potential, 2 negative pregnancy tests are required before receiving investigational product (1 negative pregnancy test at screening and 1 at the baseline visit immediately before investigational product administration).  Following a negative pregnancy test result at screening, appropriate contraception according to Appendix 25 or Appendix 24
for participants from Germany must be commenced and the second negative pregnancy test result will then be required at the baseline visit and within 5 days after the first day of the menstrual period (counting the first day of the menstrual period as Day 1) before the participant may receive the investigational product.  In the absence of regular menstrual bleeding, the study candidate should have used contraception according to Appendix 25 or 
Appendix 24 for Germany participants for at least 1 month before the second pregnancy test.  
Pregnancy tests will be repeated at every visit including treatment and follow-up visits, and at the end of the study to confirm that the participant has not become pregnant during the study.  Pregnancy tests will also be conducted whenever 1 menstrual cycle is missed during the active treatment period and/or when potential pregnancy is otherwise suspected, and may be repeated if requested by institutional review boards (IRBs)/ethics committees (ECs) or if required by local regulations.  In the case of a confirmed pregnancy, the participant will be withdrawn from administration of investigational product but should remain in the study for the early withdrawal visit.

7.5. Safety Assessments
Safety will be assessed by the spontaneous reporting of AEs, physical examinations and 
clinical laboratory results.  Unscheduled safety assessments may be performed at any time during the study to assess any perceived safety concerns.  Investigators and Pfizer Clinicians will review individual participant data throughout the conduct of the study to ensure thewell-being of study participants.
7.5.1. Chest X-RAY
Chest radiograph (posterior-anterior and lateral views are recommended, however, local 
guidelines should be followed).  If another diagnostic image (ie, CT or MRI was already 
completed within 12 weeks prior to Day 1, this may be accepted).  The image will show no 
evidence of current, active TB or previous inactive TB, general infections, heart failure or 
malignancy, and must be read by a qualified radiologist. Documentation of the official 
reading must be located and available in the source documentation.
7.5.2. Electrocardiogram
Single 12-lead ECGs should be collected at times specified in the Schedule of Activities .
All scheduled ECGs should be performed after the participant has rested quietly for at least 
10 minutes in a supine position and prior to any blood collection procedures.CCI

Page 101The Day  1 pre -dose ECG values will serve as each participant ’s baseline values. To ensure 
safet y of the participant s, a qualified individual (investigator or sub- investigator) at the 
investigator site will make comparisons to baseline measurements. A paper or digital cop y 
of the ECG should be filed in the participant ’s chart and must be available to the sponsor 
upon request.  An y clinically significant changes will be recorded as AEs and evaluated 
further, as cl inicall y warranted.  In some cases, it may be appropriate to repeat abnormal 
ECGs to rule out improper lead placement as contributing to the ECG abnormality .
7.5.3. Vital Signs
Vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate [pulse], respirations and temperature) will be measured
after approximately 5minutes of rest as indicated in the Schedule of Activities .
Blood pressure (BP) will be measured using a standard calibrated blood pressure measuring 
device.  A BP device that uses multiple cuff sizes for the participant based on the arm 
circumference is required.  The arm circumference at the midpoint of the lengt h of the upper 
arm should be measured to determine the appropriate cuff size in accordance with the 
specifications of the BP measuring device.  The same properly  sized and calibrated blood 
pressure cuff will be used to measure blood pressure each time. The use of automated
devices for measuring BP and heart rate (pulse) are acceptable, although, when done 
manually , heart rate will be measured in the brachial/radial artery  for at least 30 seconds.
Participant s should be seated in a chair, back supported, an d arms bared (free of restrictions 
such as rolled- up sleeves, etc) and supported at the level of the heart. Measurements should 
be taken on the same arm (preferabl y the non -dominant arm) at each visit throughout the 
study  after 5 -10minutes of rest and re corded to the nearest mm Hg.  Participant s should 
refrain from smoking or ingesting caffeine during the 30 minutes prior to the measurements.
Heart rate should be measured at approximately  the same time as BP for a minimum of 
30seconds.  When the timing o f BP and heart rate measurements coincides with a blood 
collection or other stud y procedure, BP and heart rate should be obtained first.
It is preferred that bod y temperature be collected using the t ympanic or oral methods and that 
the same method be used consistently  throughout the study .
7.5.4. Medical History
A complete medical history will be taken including onset of DM disease .  The clinical 
involvement of additional organs, (ie, lung, heart, liv er) and prior DM treatments will be 
recorded .  Participant s should have had a standard work up for dermatom yositis (prior to) 
baseline.  Stable interstitial lung disease related to DM that is not severe in the opinion of the 
investigator is allowed, i e,no supplemental ox ygen permitted.  If their DM diagnosis is 
within 2 years of the screening visit, then they must have completed either age appropriate 
malignancy  screening and a CT of the chest/abdomen/pelvis; or Positron emission 
tomograph y (PET)CT of chest/abdomen/pelvis at least once prior to the baseline visit.

Page 1027.5.5. Physical Examinations
Complete phy sical examination (PE) must be performed by  the investigator, sub -investigator 
or a qualified health professional per local guidelines.  Complete PE consists of assessments 
of general appearance, skin, head, ey es, ears, nose and throat (HEENT), heart, lungs, breast 
(optional), abdomen, external genitalia (optional), extremities, neurologic function, back, and 
lymph nodes.
Targeted PE must be performed by  the investigator, sub -investigator or a qualified health 
professional per local guidelines.  Targeted PE consists of assessments of skin, heart, lungs, 
abdomen, and examination of body  systems where there are s ymptom complaints by  the 
participant .  Target phy sical exam should be completed prior to dosing.
Complete and targe ted phy sical examinations are performed at various time points, see 
Schedules of Activities .
7.5.6. Height and Weight
Height and weight will be measured without the participant wearing shoes. Height (inches or 
centimeters) and weight (pounds or kilograms) will be measured up to one decimal place and 
recorded in the source document at the baseline visit.
Height (inches or centimeters) will be measured at times according to the SOA . Weight will 
continue to be asse ssed and recorded at various time points, see Schedules of Activities .
7.5.7. Tuberculosis (TB) Screening and Monitoring
7.5.7.1. Interferon Gamma Release Assay (IGRA) Tuberculin Test
Participant s should be screened for TB using an Interferon gamma release assay  (IGRA) per 
local guidelines. IGRA will be tested during screening or within 12 weeks prior to Day 1. 
The following are acceptable IGRA assay s: In-Tube test (QFT -GIT) and QuantiFERON®-TB 
Gold test (QFT- G).  If T-spot®TB test was completed within 12 weeks prior to Day 1, this is 
acceptable, however this test ty pe cannot be offered for participant s requiring the test during 
screening , or treatment . 
Site personnel should follow the processing and analy ses steps based on the assay  chosen.  
Ensure incubation steps are followed as appropriate. Documentation of IGRAproduct used 
and the test result must be in the participant ’s source documentation.
If the results of the IGRA are indeterminate, the test may  be repeated, and if a negative result 
isobtained, enrollment may  proceed. A positive test on repeat is exclusionary .
Participant s with repeat indeterminate IGRA results may  be enrolled after consultation with 
an infectious disease and/or pulmonary  specialist who determines that the risk of inf ection is 
low (ie, participant would be acceptable for immunosuppressant treatment without additional 
action).

Page 103There is no additional scheduled testing for TB after screening .  However, i f at an y time the 
participant has signs or sy mptoms associated with T B, the investigator should complete 
additional TB testing to ensure TB activation has not occurred. 
Refer to lab manual for any  additional processing information and shipping instructions.
7.5.8. Monitoring forInfections
Participant s will be monitored for development of any  infection (viral, bacterial, and fungal).  
Infections will be classified as either treated or non -treated infections.  All treated infections 
occurring during the study require identification of the causative organism, if feasible, 
wheth er by culture, antigen assay , serology , etc. (as appropriate) and the results (eg, any 
identified organisms or absence of growth) recorded in the CRF.
Treated infections are infections that:
Require antimicrobial therap ybyany route of administration or;
Require any surgical intervention (eg, incision and drainage).
Treated infections will be further classified as serious or non- serious.  Serious infections are 
treated infections that:
Require parenteral antimicrobial therapy or;
Required hospitalization fortreatment or;
Meet other criteria that require the infection to be classified as aSAE.
A participant who experiences a serious infection should be discontinued from treatment. A 
serious infection should be reported as a SAE and should be listed as the reason for 
discontinuation in the CRF.  All serious infections occurring during the study  should undergo 
appropriate laboratory investigations, including culture, and the results (eg, any  identified 
organisms or absence of growth) be recorded in the CRF.
7.5.9. Viral Surveillance
Blood sample for possible anal ysis of cy tomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein -Barr virus (EBV), 
herpes simplex virus ty pe1 (HSV -1), herpes simplex virus ty pe2 (HSV -2) and
varicella -zoster virus (VZV), Human Herpes Virus 6 (HHV6) and other virus es will be 
collected according to the times outlined in the Schedule of Activities . Additional sample 
collection instructions will be provided in the laboratory  manual.
Note: Due to long turnaround time, the retrospective nature of these labs might make their 
reporting time quite delayed.
In addition to time points specified, a blood sample for viral surveillance sample may also be 
taken at the time of an AE,asclinically  appropriate.

Punch biopsy is considered the primary technique for obtaining diagnostic full -thickness 
skin specimens. During this study punch biopsies (4 mm each) will be collected from all participants in the Stage 1, 2, and Amended Stage 2 of the study. Four punch biopsies will be collected at baseline Day 1.  Two biopsies from an active skin lesion and two biopsies from skin that is healthy and free of any skin lesions, or discoloration. At Week 12, two biopsies will be collected from the same area as the baseline biopsies for the active lesion. For additional information on acceptable body locations for punch biopsy, please see the lab manual. 
For participants enrolled in the Amended Stage 2 part of the study, an additional 2 biopsies 
will be collected at Week 24, Visit 9. Biopsies should be collected from the same active lesion area as previously collected. All biopsies will be analyzed to see if there are any changes from the baseline biopsies in an manner, after study treatment. 
Additional information on the collection and processing of the skin biopsies will be provided 
in the lab manual under separate cover. Histology and immunohistochemistry will be performed on tissue slices to understand changes in tissue morphology. RNA will be extracted to understand gene expression changes following treatment.
7.5.11. Infusion Site Reaction Assessment
Infusion site reactions will be assessed according to the Schedule of Activities .  Infusion site 
reactions may include but are not limited to erythema, induration, ecchymosis, pain, and pruritus.
Any signs or symptoms related to an infusion site reaction should be treated according to the 
investigator’s standard of care and reported as adverse events.
7.6. Rater Qualifications

A 0 - 10point scale is proposed for use. An abbreviated group of 8 proximal, distal, and 
axial muscles performs similarly  to a total of 24 muscle groups, and is al so proposed for use 
for research studies.
To ensure uniform conduct of the MMT-8 in participants with DM, investigators or other 
qualified site personnel will be required to go through training session(s) led by a qualified 
individual, or video training.  Personnel responsible for conducting the MMT -8 will be 
permitted to complete MMT -8 assessments once training is completed and proper 
documentation of training is issued.  It is highl y recommended that the same individual 
conduct the CDASI assessment from visit to visit to decrease variability .(See Appendix 21).
7.6.3. MDAAT Stage 3
Global extramuscular disease activity  is measured by  the MDAAT , a tool with a 
comprehensive approach that assesses constitutional, cutaneous, skeletal, gastrointestinal, 
pulmonary , and cardiovascular activity .To ensure uniform conduct of the MDAAT in 
participant s with DM, investigators or other qualified site personnel will be required to go 
through training session(s) led by  a qualified individual, or video training.  (See 
Appendix 20) 
7.7. Patient Reported Outcomes
When the participant reports to the clinic for a visit, the order in which the patient reported 
outcomes are completed is important, and these assessments should be completed at every  
visit in the same consistent order .  Please find the following descriptions of all patient 
reported outcomes used in this study . 
7.7.1. The Short Form -36 V ersion 2, Acute (SF -36 v2 acute )
The Short Form (36) Health Survey  (SF-36) version 2, acute is a 36 item generic health 
status measure.15,16,17  It measures 8 health domains: phy sical function, role phy sical, bodily  
pain, general health, vitality , soci al functioning, role emotional, and mental health.  These 
domains can be summarized as phy sical component scores (PCS) and mental component 
scores (MCS). The SF -36 acute version uses a one -week recall and is suitable for use when 
the measure is administer ed repeatedl y on a weekly basis. The SF -36 will be collected as 
indicated in the Schedule of Activities.  A cop y of the SF -36 version 2, acute questionnaire 
can be found in Appendix 7.
7.7.2. 5 -D Pruritus Scale
The 5 -D Pruritus Scale measures five dimensions of itch: degree, duration, direction, 
disability  and distribution .18This patient -reported questionnaire is a multidimensional L ikert 
response instrument designed to evaluate several components of chronic pruritus, including 
the areas of the bod y affected, itch intensit y, course of itch through the day, impact on sleep 
and activities of daily living and disability induced by the pruritus and whether or not the 
symptom has changed in the past two weeks and would provide pruritus assessments

without impact on quality of life daily.19,20,21,22,23  The 5-D Pruritus Scale was validated in 
participants with dermatological and systemic diseases and has a recall period of two weeks.
22The 5-D Pruritus Scale will be collected as indicated in the Schedule of Activities .  
A copy of the scale can be found in Appendix 9 .
7.7.3. Dermatology and Life Quality Index (DLQI)
The DLQI (Dermatology and Life Quality Index) is a 10-item, validated patient-reported 
questionnaire used in clinical practice and clinical trials to assess the impact of skin conditions on quality of life.  This 10-item questionnaire is applicable to participants with various skin diseases and has a recall period of one Week24.  The DLQI is calculated by summing the score of each question resulting in a minimum of 0 to maximum of 30, with a higher score indicating a greater QoL impairment.  Using a Likert scale, this questionnaire assesses symptoms and feelings, daily activities, leisure, work and school, personal relationships, and distress as related to the participant’s skin condition.  The DLQI will be collected as indicated in the Schedule of Activities .  A copy of the DLQI can be found in 
Appendix 8 . 
7.7.4. Health Assessment Questionnaire – Disability Index (HAQ-DI) start
Participants will complete the HAQ-DI that assesses the degree of difficulty a patient has 
experienced during the past week in 8 domains of daily living activities: dressing andgrooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and other activities.
25
For each of these eight domains, the patient reports the amount of difficulty they have in performing specific activities. For each question, the level of difficulty is scored from 0 to 3 with 0 representing “without any difficulty,” and 3 as “unable to do.” Participants should complete the section on activities that require them to use aids and/or devices or if they need help from another person. These sections may be left blank if no aids or devices are required or no help from another person is needed. The HAQ-DI will be collected as indicated in the Schedule of Activities . A copy of the HAQ-DI questionnaire can be found in Appendix 12 .

The Patient’s Global Assessment (PtGA) is a single item question to measure the global 
evaluation as reported by the patient. The PtGA question assesses the patient’s overall activity at the time of assessment using a 10 cm visual analog scale (VAS) by asking the patient to answer: “Your myositis is the result of the combined effects of many disease processes.  One of these is disease activity, which is active inflammation in your muscles, skin, joints, intestines, heart, lungs or other parts of your body, which can improve when treated with medicines. Considering all the ways that myositis affects you, please rate the overall activity of your disease today by placing a mark on the line below.” Higher scores indicate extremely active or severe disease activity.
29,30The PtGA will be collected as 
indicated in the Schedule of Activities . A copy of PtGA questionnaire can be found in 
Appendix 13 .
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
7.7.8. Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy - fatigue (FACIT-F)
The Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy - fatigue (FACIT-F) scale is a 
13-item instrument to measure fatigue or tiredness and its impact on a patient's daily activities and functioning. The FACIT-F includes items such as tiredness, weakness, lack of energy, and the impact of these feelings on daily functioning (eg, sleeping, and social activities). The content validity and psychometric properties of the instrument have been established in different chronic conditions including rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus etc. Each item is scored from 0 to 4 with 0 representing “Not 
at all” to 4 as “Very much”. To score the FACIT-F, all items are summed to create a single 
fatigue score with a range from 0 to 52. Items are reverse scored when appropriate to provide a scale in which higher scores represent better functioning or less fatigue. The FACIT-F will be collected as indicated in the Schedule of Activities . A copy of the 
FACIT-F can be found in Appendix 11 .
For this study, participants in Stage 2, the Amended Stage 2, and Stage 3 will complete the 
patient reported outcomes in the following order, prior to any other clinical assessments:

The DLQI and the FACIT-F need to be assessed only in the skin cohort and the muscle 
cohort, respectively. When the participant reports to the clinic for a visit, the order in which the patient reported outcomes are completed is important, and these assessments should be completed at every visit in the chronological order for both the cohorts as listed above.   
These patient reported outcomes should be completed prior to any other clinical activities and checked by site staff for completeness.
7.8. Physician Clinician Assessment
7.8.1. Physician Global Assessment (PhGA, Visual Analogue Scale VAS)The Physician Global Assessment (PhGA, VAS) is an assessment of the participant’s general 
health status rather than the disease activity in a specific organ ( Appendix 3 ).  The 
investigator will be asked to make a mark on a visual analog scale answering the question “The patient’s DM at this time is”.  The scale uses a 100 mm VAS which has verbal anchors CCI

overall disease activity  and response to treatment at the time of the clinic visit. 
This assessment should be completed b y the same physician completing the CDA SI.
7.9.Total Improvement Score for Stage 3
There are 6 core set measures that comprise the tot al improvement score. These components 
are the ph ysician global activity  assessment , the patient global activit y assessment, MMT -8 
score, HAQ -DI score, the myositis disease activity  assessment tool , (MDAAT), and the 
participant’s most elevated muscle enz ymes. The total improvement score is the sum of all 
6improvement scores associated with the change in each core set measure.  See 
Appendix 22. 
7.10. Clinical Laboratory Tests
The following laboratory tests will be performed at time points defined in the Schedule of 
Activities.  Sample collection, labeling, storage and shipping instructions can be found in the 
laboratory  manual.
Additional blood samp les may  need to be collected at times not specified in the protocol
(eg,replacement of clotted or compromised specimens, or repeat of clinically  significant out 
of range laboratory  results.
Laboratory  tests may  be repeated once during screening; the last value will be used to 
determine participant eligibility .  Unscheduled clinical labs may  be obtained at an y time 
during the study to assess any perceived safet y concerns at the investigator’s discretion.  All 
laboratory  tests with clinically  important changes from baseline identified after 
administration of investigational product will be followed until the value stabilizes.
For samples that are collected for safety  labs or pharmacokinetics, sa mple that remains after 
the intended anal ysis may  be used to better understand potential adverse events.

8. ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING
8.1. RequirementsThe table below summarizes the requirements for recording safety events on the CRF and for 
reporting safety events on the Clinical Trial (CT) Serious Adverse Event (SAE) Report Form to Pfizer Safety.  These requirements are delineated for 3 types of events: (1) SAEs; (2) non-serious adverse events (AEs); and (3) exposure to the investigational product under study during pregnancy or breastfeeding, and occupational exposure.

exposureExposure during pregnancy , 
exposure via breastfeeding, 
occupational exposure 
(regardless of whether 
associated with an AE)
All observe d or volunteered events regardless of treatment group or suspected causal 
relationship to the investigational product(s) will be reported as described in the following 
paragraphs.
Events listed in the table above that requir e reporting to Pfizer Safet y on the CT SAE Report 
Form within 24 hours of awareness of the event by  the investigator are to be reported 
regardless of whether the event is determined by the investigator to be related to an 
investigational product under study .  In particular, if the SAE is fatal or life -threatening, 
notification to Pfizer Safety  must be made immediately , irrespective of the extent of available 
event information. This time frame also applies to additional new (follow -up) information on 
previously  forwarded reports.  I n the rare situation that the investigator does not become 
immediately  aware of the occurrence of an event, the investigator must report the event 
within 24 hours after learning of it and document the time of his/her first awareness of the 
event.
For each event, the investigator must pursue and obtain adequate information both to 
determine the outcome and to assess whether it meets the criteria for classification as an SAE 
(see Section 8.2.3 ).  In addition, the investigator may  be requested by  Pfizer Safety  to obtain 
specific follow -up information in an expedited fashion.  This information is more detailed 
than that recorded on the CRF.  I n general, this will include a description of the event in 
sufficient detail to allow for a complete medical assessment of the case and independent 
determination of possible causality .  Any  information relevant to the event, such as 
concomitant medications a nd illnesses, must be provided.  In the case of a participant death, a 
summary of available autopsy  findings must be submitted as soon as possible to Pfizer 
Safety .  Any  pertinent additional information must be reported on the CT SAE Report Form; 
additional source documents (eg, medical records, CRF, laboratory  data) are to be sent to 
Pfizer Safety  ONLY upon request.

Page 116As part of ongoing safet y reviews conducted b y the sponsor, an y non -serious AE that is 
determined b y the sponsor to be serious will be reporte d by the sponsor as an SAE.  To assist 
in the determination of case seriousness, further information may  be requested from the 
investigator to provide clarity  and understanding of the event in the context of the clinical 
study .
8.1.1. Additional Details on Record ing Adverse Events on the CRF
All events detailed in the table above will be recorded on the AE page(s) of the CRF.  I t 
should be noted that the CT SAE Report Form for reporting of SAE information is not the 
same as the AE page of the CRF.  When the same data are collected, the forms must be 
completed in a consistent manner.   AEs should be recorded using concise medical 
terminology  and the same AE term should be used on both the CRF and the CT SAE Report 
Form for reporting of SAE information.
8.1.2. Eliciting Adverse Event Information
The investigator is to record on the CRF all directly  observed AEs and all AEs spontaneously  
reported b y the stud y participant.  In addition, each study  participant will be questioned about 
the occurrence of AEs in a non- leading m anner.
8.1.3. Withdrawal from the Study Due to Adverse Events (see also the Participant
Withdrawal (Early Termination) section)
Withdrawal due to AEs should be distinguished from withdrawal due to other causes, 
according to the definition of AE noted below, and recorded on the CRF. 
When a participant withdraws from the stud y because of an SAE, the SAE must be recorded 
onthe CRF and reported, as appropr iate, on the CT SAE Rep ort Form, in accordance with 
the Requirements section above.
8.1.4. Time Period for Collecting AE/SAE Information
The time period for actively  eliciting and collecting AEs and SAEs (“active collection 
period”) for each participant begins from the time the participant provides informed consent, 
which is obtained before the participant ’s participation in the study  (ie, before undergoing 
any study -related procedure and/or receiving investigational product), through and including 
a minimum of 5 months after the last administration of the investigational product .
For participant s who are screen failures, the active collection period ends when sc reen failure 
status is determined.
8.1.4.1. Reporting SAEs to Pfizer Safety
All SAEs occurring in a participant during the active collection period are reported to Pfizer 
Safety  on the CT SAE Report Form.
PF-06823859
C0251002
Final Protocol Amendment 6, 20September 2021 
PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL
Page 117SAEs occurring in a participant after the active collection period has ended are reported to 
Pfizer Safety  if the investigator becomes aware of them; at a minimum, all SAEs that the 
investigator believes have at least a reasonable possibility  of being related to investigational 
product must be reported to Pfizer Sa fety.
Follow up by  the investigator continues throughout and after the active collection period and 
until the event or its sequelae resolve or stabilize at a level acceptable to the investigator, and 
Pfizer concurs with that assessment.
8.1.4.2. Recording Non -serio us AEs and SAEs on the CRF
During the active collection period, both non- serious AEs and SAEs are recorded on the 
CRF.
Follow -up by  the investigator may  be required until the event or its sequelae resolve or 
stabilize at a level acceptable to the investigator, and Pfizer concurs with that assessment .
8.1.5. Causality Assessment
The investigator’s assessment of causalit y must be provided for all AEs (serious and 
non-serious); the investigator must record the causal relationship on the CRF, and report such 
an assessment in accordance with the SAE reporting requirements ,if applicable.  An 
investigator’s causalit y assessment is the determination of whether there exists a reasonable 
possibility  that the investigational product caused or contributed to an AE; gene rally the facts 
(evidence ) or arguments to suggest a causal relationship should be provided.  If the 
investigator does not know whether or not the investigational product caused the event, then 
the event will be handled as “related to investigational produ ct” for reporting purposes, as 
defined b y the sponsor.  If the investig ator's causality  assessment is “ unknown but not 
related” to investigational product, this should be clearl y documented on study  records. 
In addition, if the investigator determines tha t an SAE is associated with study  procedures, 
the investigator must record this causal relationship in the source documents and CRF, and 
report such an assessment in the dedicated section of the CT SAE Report Form and in 
accordance with the SAE reporting r equirements.
8.1.6. Sponsor’s Reporting Requirements to Regulatory Authorities
AE reporting, including suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions, will be carried out 
in accordance with applicable local regulations.

An AE is an y unt oward medical occurrence in a study  participant administered a product or 
medical device; the event need not necessaril y have a causal relationship with the treatment 
or usage.  Examples of AEs include, but are not limited to: 
Abnormal test findings;

Final Protocol Amendment 6, 20September 2021 
PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL
Page 118Clinically  significant signs and sy mptoms;
Changes in ph ysical examination findings;
Hypersensitivity ;
Progression/worsening of underl ying disease ;
Drug abuse;
Drug dependency .
Additionally , AEs may  include signs and s ymptoms resulting from:
Drug overdose ;
Drug withdrawal;
Drug misuse; 
Drug interactions;
Extravasation;
Exposure during pregnancy  (EDP);
Exposure via breastfeeding;
Medication error;
Occupational exposure.
8.2.2. Abnormal Test Findings
Abnormal objective test findings should be recorded as AEs when any of the following 
conditions are met: 
Test result is associated with accompan ying symptoms; and/or
Test result requires additional diagnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention; 
and/or
Test result leads to a change in stud y dosing (outside of an y protocol -specified dose 
adjustments) or discontinuation from the study , significant additional concomitant 
drug treatment, or other therap y; and/or
Test result is considered to be an AE b y the investigator or sponsor.

PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL
Page 119Merel y repeating an abnormal test, i n the absence of an y of the above conditions, does not 
constitute an AE.  An y abnormal test result that is determined to be an error does not require 
recording as an AE.
8.2.3. Serious Adverse Events
A serious adverse event is any  untoward medical occurrence at a ny dose that:
Results in death;
Is life -threatening (immediate risk of death);
Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization;
Results in persistent or significant disability /incapacity  (substantial disruption of the 
ability to conduct normal life functions);
Results in congenital anomaly /birth defect.
Or that is considered to be:
An important medical event.
Medical and scientific judgment is exercised in determining whether an event is an important 
medical event.  An importa nt medical event may  not be immediately  life-threatening and/or 
result in death or hospitalization.  However, if it is determined that the event may  jeopardize 
the participant or may  require intervention to prevent one of the other AE outcomes, the 
importa nt medical event should be reported as serious.
Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency  room or at home for 
allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization; 
or development of drug depende ncy or drug abuse.
8.2.4. Hospitalization
Hospitalization is defined as an y initial admission (even less than 24 hours) in a hospital or 
equivalent healthcare facility , or any  prolongation of an existing admission.  Admission also 
includes transfer within the hos pital to an acute/intensive care unit (eg, from the psy chiatric 
wing to a medical floor, medical floor to a coronary  care unit, or neurological floor to a 
tuberculosis unit).  An emergency  room visit does not necessarily constitute a hospitalization; 
howev er, the event leading to the emergency  room visit is assessed for medical importance.
Hospitalization does not include the following:
Rehabilitation facilities;
Hospice facilities;
PF-06823859
C0251002
Final Protocol Amendment 6, 20September 2021 
PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL
Page 120Respite care (eg, caregiver relief);
Skilled nursing facilities;
Nursing ho mes;
Same -day surgeries (as outpatient/same -day/ambulatory  procedures).
Hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization in the absence of a precipitating clinical 
AE is not in itself an SAE.  Examples include:
Admission for treatment of a preexisting condition not associated with the 
development of a new AE or with a worsening of the preexisting condition (eg, for 
workup of a persistent pretreatment laboratory  abnormality );
Social admission (eg, participant has no place to sleep);
Administrative admission (eg, for yearly physical examination);
Protocol -specified admission during a stud y (eg, for a procedure required by the stud y 
protocol);
Optional admission not associated with a precipitating clinical AE (eg, for elective 
cosmetic surgery );
Hospitalizati on for observation without a medical AE;
Preplanned treatments or surgical procedures.  These should be noted in the baseline 
documentation for the entire protocol and/or for the individual participant .
Diagnostic and therapeutic noninvasive and invasive procedures, such as surgery , should not 
be reported as SAEs.  However, the medical condition for which the procedure was 
performed should be reported if it meets the definition of an SAE.  For example, an acute 
appendicitis that begins during the reporting period should be reported if the SAE 
requirements are met, and the resulting appendectomy  should be recorded as treatment of the 
AE.
8.3.Severity Assessment
If required on the AE page of the CRF, the investigator will use the adjectives MILD, 
MODERATE, or SEVERE to describe the maximum intensity  of the AE.  For purposes 
of consistency , these intensity  grades are defined as follows:
MILD Does not interfere with participant 's usual function.
MODERATE Interferes to some extent with participant 's usual functi on.
SEVERE Interferes significantl y with participant 's usual function.
PF-06823859
C0251002
Final Protocol Amendment 6, 20September 2021 
PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL
Page 121Note the distinction between the severit y and the seriousness of an AE.  A severe event is not 
necessarily  an SAE.  For example, a headache may  be severe (interferes significantly  with 
the participant 's usual function) but would not be classified as serious unless it met one of the 
criteria for SAEs, listed above.
8.4.Special Situations
8.4.1. Protocol -Specified Serious Adverse Events
There are no protocol -specified SAEs in this study.  All SAEs will be reported to Pfizer 
Safety  by the investigator as described in previous sections, and will be handled as SAEs in 
the safet y database. 
8.4.2. Potential Cases of Drug -Induced Liver Injury
Humans exposed to a drug who show no sign of liver injury  (as determined by  elevations in 
transaminases) are termed “tolerators,” while th ose who show transient liver injury , but adapt 
are termed “adaptors.”  In some participant s, transaminase elevations are a harbinger of a 
more serious potential outcome.  These participant s fail to adapt and therefore are 
"susceptible" to progressive and serious liver injury , commonl y referred to as drug -induced 
liver injury  (DILI).  Participant s who experience a transaminase elevation above 3 times the 
upper limit of normal ( ×ULN) should be monitored more frequentl y to determine if they  are 
an “adaptor” or are “susceptible.”
In the majority  of DILI cases, elevations in aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and/or alanine 
aminotransferase (ALT) precede total bilirubin (TBili) elevations (>2 ×ULN) by  several 
days or weeks.  The increase in TBili ty picall y occur s while AST/ALT is/are still elevated 
above 3 ×ULN (ie, AST/AL T and TBili values will be elevated within the same lab sample).  
In rare instances, b y the time TBili elevations are detected, AST/ALT values might have 
decreased.  This occurrence is still re garded as a potential DILI.  Therefore, abnormal 
elevations in either AST OR AL T in addition to TBili that meet the criteria outlined below 
are considered potential DILI (assessed per Hy ’s law criteria) cases and should alway s be 
considered important medic al events, even before all other possible causes of liver injury  
have been excluded.
The threshold of laboratory  abnormalities for a potential DILI case depends on the 
participant ’s individual baseline values and underly ing conditions.  Participant s who present 
with the following laboratory  abnormalities should be evaluated further as potential DILI 
(Hy’s law) cases to definitively  determine the etiology  of the abnormal laboratory  values:
Participant s with AST/ALT and TBili baseline values within the normal range who 
subsequently  present with AST OR AL T values >3 × ULN AND a TBili value 
>2× ULN with no evidence of hemol ysis and an alkaline phosphatase value 
<2×ULN or not available;
For participant s with baseline AST OR ALT OR TBili values above the ULN, the 
following threshold values are used in the definition mentioned above, as needed, 
depending on which values are above the ULN at baseline:
PF-06823859
C0251002
Final Protocol Amendment 6, 20September 2021 
PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL
Page 122Preexisting AST or ALT baseline values above the normal range: AST or ALT 
values >2 times the baseline values AN D >3 × ULN; or >8 × ULN (whichever is 
smaller).
Preexisting values of TBili above the normal range: TBili level increased from 
baseline value b y an amount of at least 1 × ULN or if the value reaches >3 × ULN 
(whichever is smaller).
Rises in AST/AL T and TBi li separated b y more than a few weeks should be assessed 
individually  based on clinical judgment; any  case where uncertainty  remains as to whether it 
represents a potential Hy’s law case should be reviewed with the sponsor. 
The participant should return t o the investigator site and be evaluated as soon as possible, 
preferabl y within 48 hours from awareness of the abnormal results.  This evaluation should 
include laboratory  tests, detailed history , and physical assessment.
In addition to repeating measurements of AST and AL T and TBili, laboratory  tests should 
include albumin, creatine kinase (CK), direct and indirect bilirubin, gamma -glutam yl 
transferase (GGT), prothrombin time (PT)/international normalized ratio (INR), total bile 
acids, alkaline phosphatase and acetaminophen drug and/or protein adduct levels.  
Consideration should also be given to drawing a separate tube of clotted blood and an 
anticoagulated tube of blood for further testing, as needed, for further contemporaneous 
analyses at the t ime of the recognized initial abnormalities to determine etiology .  A detailed 
history , including relevant information, such as review of ethanol, acetaminophen (either b y 
itself or as a co formulated product in prescription or over- the-counter medications), 
recreational drug, supplement (herbal) use and consumption, family  history , sexual history , 
travel history , history  of contact with a jaundiced person, surgery , blood transfusion, history  
of liver or allergic disease, and potential occupational exposure to chemicals, should be 
collected.  Further testing for acute hepatitis A, B, C, D, and E infection and liver imaging 
(eg, biliary  tract) may  be warranted. 
All cases demonstrated on repeat testing as meeting the laboratory  criteria of AST/AL T and 
TBili e levation defined above should be considered potential DILI (Hy ’s law) cases if no 
other reason for the liver function test ( LFT)abnormalities has y et been found.  Such 
potential DILI (Hy’s law) cases are to be reported as SAEs, irrespective of availabilit y 
of all the results of the investigations performed to determine etiology of the LFT 
abnormalities.
A potential DILI (Hy ’s law) case becomes a confirmed case onl y after all results of 
reasonable investigations have been received and have excluded an alte rnative etiology .

For Participant s with DM who experience elevated AST, ALT, LDH, a ldolase, and CK, due 
to muscle involvement the investigator should determine whether or not these are related to 
the existing condition of DM or if these lab abnormalities are related to another condition.  
Information should be provided in the source documentation with rationale related to any  lab 
abnormalities.
8.4.3. Exposure to the Investigational Product During Pregnancy or Breastfeeding, and 
Occupational Exposu re
Exposure to the investigational product under study  during pregnancy  or breastfeeding and 
occupational exposure are reportable to Pfizer Safety  within 24 hours of investigator 
awareness.
8.4.3.1. Exposure during Pregnancy
For both unapproved/unlicensed products and for marketed products, an exposure during 
pregnancy  (EDP) occurs if:
A female becomes, or is found to be, pregnant either while receiving or having been 
exposed (eg, because of treatment or environmental exposure) to the investigational 
product; or the female becomes or is found to be pregnant after discontinuing and/or 
being exposed to the investigational product;
An example of environmental exposure would be a case involving direct contact 
with a Pfizer product in a pregnant woman (eg, a nurse reports that she is pregnant 
and has been exposed to chemotherapeutic products).
A male has been exposed (eg, because of treatment or environmental exposure) to 
the investigational product prior to or around the time of conception and/or is 
exposed during his par tner’s pregnancy .
If a participant or participant ’s partner becomes or is found to be pregnant during the 
participant ’s treatment with the investigational product, the investigator must report this 
information to Pfizer Safety  on the CT SAE Report Form and an EDP supplemental form, 
regardless of whether an SAE has occurred.   In addition, the investigator must submit 
information regarding environmental exposure to a Pfizer product in a pregnant woman 
(eg,participant report sthat she is pregnant and has bee n exposed to a cy totoxic product by  
inhalation or spillage) to Pfizer Safety using the EDP supplemental form.  This must be done
irrespective of whether an AE has occurred and within 24 hours of awareness of the 
exposure.  The information submitted should include the anticipated date of delivery 
(seebelow for information related to termination of pregnancy ).
Follow -up is conducted to obtain general information on the pregnancy  and its outcome for 
all EDP reports with an unknown outcome.  The investigator will follow the pregnancy  until 
completion (or until pregnancy  termination) and notify  Pfizer Safet y of the outcome as a 
follow -up to the initial EDP supplemental form.  In the case of a live birth, the structural 
PF-06823859
C0251002
Final Protocol Amendment 6, 20September 2021 
PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL
Page 124integrit y of the neonate can be assessed a t the time of birth.  In the event of a termination, the 
reason(s) for termination should be specified and, if clinically  possible, the structural 
integrit y of the terminated fetus should be assessed by gross visual inspection (unless 
pre-procedure test fi ndings are conclusive for a congenital anomal y and the findings are 
reported).
If the outcome of the pregnancy  meets the criteria for an SAE (ie, ectopic pregnancy , 
spontaneous abortion, intrauterine fetal demise, neonatal death, or congenital anomal y [in a 
live-born bab y, a terminated fetus, an intrauterine fetal demise, or a neonatal death]), the 
investigator should follow the procedures for reporting SAEs.
Additional information about pregnancy  outcomes that are reported to Pfizer Safet y as SAEs 
follows:
Spontaneous abortion includes miscarriage and missed abortion;
Neonatal deaths that occur within 1 month of birth should be reported, without regard 
to causality , as SAEs.  In addition, infant deaths after 1 month should be reported as 
SAEs when the inve stigator assesses the infant death as related or possibly  related to 
exposure to the investigational product.
Additional information regarding the EDP may  be requested by  the sponsor.  Further 
follow -up of birth outcomes will be handled on a case- by-case b asis (eg, follow -up on 
preterm infants to identify developmental delay s).  In the case of paternal exposure, the 
investigator will provide the participant with the Pregnant Partner Release of Information 
Form to deliver to his partner.  The investigator mu st document in the source documents that 
the participant was given the Pregnant Partner Release of Information Form to provide to his 
partner.
8.4.3.2. Exposure during Breastfeeding
Scenarios of exposure during breastfeeding must be reported, irrespective of the pr esence of 
an associated SAE, to Pfizer Safet y within 24 hours of the investigator’s awareness, using the 
CT SAE Report Form.  An exposure during breastfeeding report is not created when a Pfizer 
drug specifically  approved for use in breastfeeding women (eg , vitamins) is administered in 
accord with authorized use.  However, if the infant experiences an SAE associated with such 
a drug’s administration, the SAE is reported together with the exposure during breastfeeding.
8.4.3.3. Occupational Exposure
An occupational exposure occurs when, during the performance of job duties, a person 
(whether a healthcare professional or otherwise) gets in unplanned direct contact with the 
product, which may  or may  not lead to the occurrence of an AE.
PF-06823859

awareness, using the CT SAE Report Form, regardless of whether there is an associated 
SAE.  Since the information does not pertain to a participant enrolled in the study , the 
information is not rec orded on a CRF; however, a copy of the completed CT SAE Report 
Form is maintained in the investigator site file.
8.4.4. Medication Errors 
Other exposures to the investigational product under study  may  occur in clinical trial settings, 
such as medication errors .

8.5.Medication Errors
Medication errors may  result from the administration or consumption of the investigational 
product b y the wrong participant, or at the wrong time, or at the wrong dosage strength 
Medication errors include :
Medication errors involving participant exposure t o the investigational product;
Potential medication errors or uses outside of what is foreseen in the protocol that do 
or do not involve the participating participant .
Such medication errors occurring to a stud y participant are to be captured on the medica tion 
error page of the CRF, which is a specific version of the AE page.
In the event of a medication dosing error, the sponsor should be notified immediately .
Whether or not the medication error is accompanied by  an AE, as determined by  the 
investigator, t he medication error is recorded on the medication error page of the CRF and, if 
applicable, an y associated AE(s), serious and non -serious, are recorded on an AE page of the 
CRF. 
Medication errors should be reported to Pfizer Safety within 24 hours on a CT SAE Report 
Form only when associated with an SAE .

Detailed methodology  for summary  and statistical anal yses of the data collected in this study  
is outlined here and further detailed in a statistical anal ysis plan (SAP), w hich will be 
maintained by  the sponsor.  The SAP may  modify  what is outlined in the protocol where 
appropriate; however, any  major modifications of the primary  endpoint definitions or their 
analyses will also be reflected in a protocol amendment. 
At the completion of Stage 1, the team may  provide limited summary  level (but not patient 
level) data that may  be shared externall y and internally. This will be considered preliminary  
data and the timing of the data release will be contingent on internal Pfizer procedures to 
maintain data integrity .  During this time, the investigators and select list of individuals from 
the sponsor who interact with the investigators and monitor safety will continue to be blinded 
to individual study  treatments through the query  resolution of the Stage 1 data. Patient level 
data will not be shared with the investigators until the entire study  is complete.
9.1.Sample Size Determination
9.1.1. Sample Size Determination in Stage 1
The primary  endpoint is the change from baseline in CDASI activity  score at Week 12.  The 
treatment effect is defined as the difference ( mean change from baseline at Week 12in the 
active treatment group minus the mean change from baseline at Week 12 in the placebo 
group ) in the mean change of CDASI activity  score from baseline at Week 12. A successful 
treatment should decrease CDASI  activity  score and therefore the desirable value of the 
treatment effect is negative.  The value -5 is viewed as the minimal clinically  important value 
of the treatment effect. 
In the comparison of the active treatment arm to placebo, t he treatment is declared 
efficacious if both of the following conditions aresatisfied :
C1: Estimated value of the treatment effect is lower than -5.
C2: An upper limit of 2 -sided 90% confidence interval for the treatment effect is 
below zero.
The standard deviation of the change from baseline in CDASI  activity  score is assumed to be 
equal to 8 units. This assumption is based on the analy sis of the observational data sets 
collected b y the researchers at Pfizer’s Center of Therapeutic Innovation and University of 
Pennsy lvania. 
A sample size of 24 participants (16participants in the active and 8 participants in the 
placebo treatment groups) with complete response is expected to provide 80% probability  of 
declaring efficacy  (satisfy ing both of the conditions C1 and C2) for the reference value of the 
true treatment effect equal to -8.6 units.
It is assumed that 80% of randomized participants will provide complete responses of 
CDA SI activity  score at Week 12.

Page 1279.1.2. Sample Size Determination in Stage 2
The primary  endpoint is the change from baseline in CDASI  activity  score at Week 12. 
Baseline is defined as Day  1.For each active treatment group, the treatment effect is defined 
as the difference (between the active treatment group and the placebo group across the two 
stages) in the mean change of CDASI activity  score from baseline at Week 12.The standard 
deviation of the change from baseline CDASI activity  score is assumed to be 8 units.
For the comparison of 150 mg PF -06823859 and placebo, assuming a SD of 8 and assuming 
a pooled sample size of approximately  10 and 1 1completers respectivel y across the two 
Stages , we expect thehalf length of the 90% CI to be 5.75. For the comparison of 600 mg 
PF-06823859 and placebo, assuming a SD of 8 and assuming a pooled sample size of 
approximately  21and 1 1completers respectivel y across the two S tages, we expect the 
halflength of the 90% CI to be 4.90. 
No p -values will be presented for the comparisons listed inthe objectives and endpoints of 
Section 2.2 for Stage 2.
9.1.3. Sample Size Determination inStage 3
The major efficacy  endpoint of interest in Stage 3 is the TI S,31which is a continuous measure 
ranging from 0 to 100. The treatment effect is define d as the difference in mean TIS between 
the active and placebo treatment groups at Week 12. The standard deviation in TI S at Week 
12 is estimated to be between 15 and 25 units .32,33
The DM muscle disease cohort will enroll between 8 and 16 pa rticipants randomized 1:1 to 
active and placebo. Table 3shows the estimated half widths of the 90% confidence intervals 
for the difference in mean TI S between the PF -06823859 600 mg arm and the placebo arm at 
Week 12across a range of standard deviations and number of completers. For example, if 
10 pa rticipants (5 active, 5 placebo) complete the Week 12 assessment and the SD of the TIS 
is 20, the estimated half width of the 90% confidence interval is approximately  20.8.
No p -values will be presented for the comparisons listed in the objectives and endpoints of 
Section 2.4for the DM muscle cohort.

The pr imary  efficacy  analy sisof Stage 1 and Stage 2 isbased on the CDASI  activity  scores
at W eek 12 .  The primary  efficacy  anal ysis in Stage 3 is based on theTISat Week 12.
Analysis of efficacy  endpoints will be performed for the modified intenttotreat (mITT) 
population, defined as all randomized participant s who receive at least 1 dose of 
investigational product.  Formal statistical testing for efficacy  will be based on Stage 1 data 
only.
All treatment periods in this study  will be conducted in a double blinded fashion. During this 
period, the participants, investigators and sponsor (or designee) will be blinded to
randomized study  treatments. After th e treatment period is completed for all the participants, 
some members of the study  team will be unblinded so that a report for the corresponding data 
can be generated. The participants , investigators, and individuals from the sponsor (or 
designee) who interact with the investigators and monitor safety  will continue to be blinded 
to individual study  treatments throughout the follow up period of the study .The official 
database release will occur after the last participant completes the last visit. The Clinical 
Study Report (CSR) will be based on the data generated following the database release.

Page 1299.2.1. Analysis of the Primary Endpoint 
9.2.1.1. Analysis of Primary Endpoint in Stage 1
The treatment effect is defined as the difference ( mean change from baseline at Week 12in 
the active treatment group minus the mean change from baseline at Week 12in the placebo 
group ) in the mean change of CDASI activity  score from baseline at Week 12. 
The estimates for treatment effect will be obtained by fitting the longitudinal analy sis of 
covariance (LANCOVA) model to the CDASI  activity  score change from baseline.  The 
model will include treatment (active dose and placebo), week and treatment by  week 
interaction as fixed effects and baseline value as a covariate.  Anunstructured 
variance -covariance matrix will be allowed.
A sensitivity  anal ysis will be based on the anal ysis of covariance (ANCOVA).  The 
ANCOVA -based estimation of the treatment effect will use the observations collected at 
baseline and Week 12 visits only  and will eliminate the complexity  of modeling the 
covariance between the repeated measures of outcome observed at different visits. The 
resulting estimate may  be slightly  less precise than the L ANCOVA -based estimate .
Estimates and the confidence intervals for treatment effect will be presented for each of these 
methods.
9.2.1.2. Analysis of Primary E ndpoint in Stage 2
The treatment effect is defined as the difference (between each active treatment group and 
placebo group across the two stages) in the mean change of CDASI activity  score from 
baseline at Week 12.  Baseline is defined as Day  1.
Estimates and 90% CI will be computed. No p -values will be computed for the anal ysis in 
this stage.
The estimates will be obtained using the same LANCOVA model as described in 
Section 9.2.2.1 . 
Data permitting, t he secondary  anal ysis for the primary  endpoint in Stage2will be the 
PF-06823859 exposure -response anal ysisof the combined data from Stage 1 and S tage 2. 
The Population Modeling Analysis Plan, ( PMAP )will describe the evaluation of the
relationship between PF-06823859 exposure sand response at W eek12. A nalyses developed 
to characterize th isexposure -response relationship will not be part of the Clinical Study 
Report (CSR) and may  be reported separatel y.
Additional sensitivity  anal ysis will be described in the SAP.

The primary  objective in Stage 3 is to determine the safet y and tolerability  of PF -06823859 
in adult DM participants with moderate muscle disease. No efficacy  anal yses will be 
performed for the primary  endpoint. All safet y data will be reported according to sponsor 
standards consistent with the previous stages .
9.2.2. Analysis of Secondary Endpoints
9.2.2.1. Analysis of the Secondary Endpoints in Stage 1
The values of CDASI activity  and damage scores at each visit will be summarized by  
descriptive statistics.   The estima tes for treatment effect will be obtained by L ANCOVA and 
ANCOVA methods described in Section 9.2.1 where the change from baseline of a 
corresponding score (i e,activity  or damage score) will be used as a dependent variable.  The 
ANCOVA analy sis will be used as supportive analy sis.  Estimat es and the confidence 
intervals for treatment effect will be presented for each of these methods.
9.2.2.2. Analysis of the Secondary Endpoints in Stage 2
The anal yses and summaries of the secondary  endpoints in Stage 2 will be the same as those 
in Section 9.2.2.1 except that they will be conducted for the data across the two S tages. No 
p-values will be presented for these anal yses.
As a supportive analy sis, s ummaries will also be presented for change from baseline in 
CDASI  activity  score after 12 weeks of active treatment, which includes pooled data from 
participants who received active treatment from Day  1 to Week 12 (CDASI  measured at 
Week12) and participants who received active treatment from Week 12 to Week 24 (CDASI 
measured at Week 24). This may  be compared to the participants receiving placebo during 
the first 12 weeks. Baseline is defined as Day  1 for participants who received a ctive 
treatment from Day 1 to Week 12. Baseline is defined as Week 12 for participants who 
received active treatment from Week 12 to W eek 24. Further details will be provided in the

10. QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE
Pfizer or its agent will conduct periodic monitoring visits during study conduct to ensure that 
the protocol and Good Clinical Practices (GCPs) are being followed.  The monitors may review source documents to confirm that the data recorded on CRFs are accurate.  The investigator and institution will allow Pfizer monitors/auditors or its agents and appropriate regulatory authorities direct access to source documents to perform this verification.  This verification may also occur after study completion.
During study conduct and/or after study completi on, the investigator site may be participant
to review by the IRB/EC, and/or to quality assurance audits performed by Pfizer, or companies working with or on behalf of Pfizer, and/or to inspection by appropriate regulatory authorities.
The investigator(s) will notify Pfizer or its agents immediately of any regulatory inspection 
notification in relation to the study. Furthermore, the investigator will cooperate with Pfizer or its agents to prepare the investigator site for the inspection and will allow Pfizer or its agent, whenever feasible, to be present during the inspection.  The investigator site and investigator will promptly resolve any discrepancies that are identified between the study data and the participant's medical records.  The investigator will promptly provide copies of 
the inspection findings to Pfizer or its agent.  Before response submission to the regulatory 
authorities, the investigator will provide Pfizer or its agents with an opportunity to review and comment on responses to any such findings.
It is important that the investigator(s) and their relevant personnel are available during the 
monitoring visits and possible audits or inspections and that sufficient time is devoted to the process.CCI

Page 13511.DATA HA NDLING AND RECORD KE EPING
11.1. Case Report Forms/Electronic Data Record
As used in this protocol, the term CRF should be understood to refer to either a paper form or 
an electronic data record or both, depending on the data collection method used in this study .
A CRF is required and should be completed for each included participant .  The completed 
original CRFs are the sole propert y of Pfizer and should not be made available in any form to 
third parties, except for authorized representatives of Pfizer or appropr iate regulatory  
authorities, without written permission from Pfizer.
The investigator has ultimate responsibility  for the collection and reporting of all clinical, 
safet y,and laboratory  data entered on the CRFs and any  other data collection forms (source 
documents) and ensuring th at they  are accurate, authentic /original, attributable, complete, 
consistent, legible, timely  (contemporaneous), enduring ,and available when required.  The 
CRFs must be signed b y the investigator or b y an authorized staff member to attest that the 
data contained on the CRFs aretrue. Any correcti ons to entries made in the CRFs or source 
documents must be dated, initialed ,and explained (if necessary ) and should not obscure the 
original entry . 
In most cases, the source documents are the hospital or the ph ysician participant chart.  In 
these cases, data collected on the CRFs must match the data in those charts. 
In some cases, the CRF may  also serve as the source document.  In these cases, a document 
should be available at the investigat orsite and at Pfizer that clearl y identifies those data that 
will be recorded onthe CRF, and for which the CRF will stand as the source document.
11.2. Record Retention
To enable evaluations and/or inspections/ audits from regulatory  authorities or Pfizer , the 
investigator agrees to keep records, including the identity  of all participating participant s 
(sufficient information to link records, eg, CRFs and hospital records), all original signed 
informed consent documents, copies of all CRFs, safet y reporting forms, source documents, 
and detailed records of treatment disposition, and adequate documentation of relevant 
correspondence ( eg, letters, meeting minutes, and telephone call reports).  The records should 
be retained b y the investigator accordin g to the ICH guidelines, according to local 
regulations, or as specified in the clinical study agreement (CSA) , whichever is longer.
If the investigator becomes unable for an y reason to continue to retain study records for the 
required period ( eg, retirement, relocation), Pfizer should be prospectivel y notified.  The 
study  records must be transferred to a designee acceptable to Pfizer , such as another 
investigator, another institution, or an independent third party  arranged by  Pfizer. 
Investigator records must be kept for a minimum of 15 years after completion or 
discontinuation of the study or for longer if required by  applicable local regulations.

12.ETHICS
12.1. Institutional Review Board/Ethics Committee
It is the responsibility  of the investigator to have prospective approval of the study  protocol, 
protocol amendments, informed consent documents, and other relevant doc uments, 
eg,recruitment advertisements, if applicable, from the IRB/EC .  All correspondence with the
IRB/EC should be retained in the investigator f ile.  Copies of IRB/EC approvals should be 
forwarded to Pfizer.
The only  circumstance in which an amendment may  be initiated prior to IRB/EC approval is 
where the change is necessary  to eliminate apparent immediate hazards to the participant s.  
In that event, the investigator must notify  the IRB/EC and Pfizer in writin g immediately  after 
the implementation.
12.2. Ethical Conduct of the Study

names or other identifiable data in an yreports, publications, or other disclosures, except 
where required b y law.
When study  data are compiled for transfer to Pfizer and other authorized parties, participant
name s, address es, and other identifiable data will be replaced b y numerical code sbased on a 
numbering s ystem provided by  Pfizer in order to de -identify  study  participants. The 
investigator site will maintain a confidential list of participant s who participated in the study ,
linking each participant ’snumerical code to his or her actual identity .  In case of data 
transfer, Pfizer will maintain high standards of confidentiality  and protection of participant s’
personal data consistent with applic able privacy  laws .
The informed consent document sand an y participant recruitment materials must be in 
compliance with ICH GCP, local regulatory  requirements, and legal requirements, including

Page 174Appendix 14.Guidelines for Participant Safety Monitoring and Discontinuation
These guidelines for participant safet y monitoring and discontinuation are to be applied to all 
participant s in study  C0251002.  Additional individual participant monitoring is at the 
discretion of the investigator and dependent on any  perceived safety concerns. Unscheduled 
clinical lab s may  be obtained at an y time during the study to assess such concerns, and a 
participant may be withdrawn at an y time at the discretion of the investigator.
Monitoring
Please Note : For Participant s with DM who experience elevated AST, ALT, L DH, Aldolase, 
and CK, due to muscle involvement the investigator should determine whether or not these 
are related to the existing condition of DM or if these lab abnormalities are related to another 
condition. (If related to DM, GGT should be <1.5 ULN )Information sho uld be provided in 
the source documentation with rationale related to any  lab abnormalities.
The following laboratory abnormalities require re -testing within 1 week:
Any single AST and/or AL T elevation ≥3times the upper limit of normal (repeat 
laboratory testing should include albumin, creatine kinase, total bilirubin, direct and 
indirect bilirubin, GGT, PT [prothrombin time] with I NR [international normalized 
ratio], and alkaline phosphatase), regardless of the total bilirubin.  (Please note that 
3times the upper limit of normal increases in ALT, AST need confirmation on 
separate blood draw before undertaking thorough evaluation for liver injury);
For women of child -bearing potential with any  positive urine -hCG test, the 
participant will have study  drug interrupted and a serum sample submitted to the 
central laboratory  for -hCG testing.
Discontinuation
Investigators are encouraged to discuss with the sponsor’s Clinical team as soon as possible ,
and participant s are to be discontinue d from treatment if any  of the following occur during 
the study :
Serious infections defined as an y infection (viral, bacterial, and fungal) requiring 
parenteral antimicrobial therap y, hospitalization for treatment, or meeting other 
criteria that require th e infection to be classified as serious adverse event;
Other serious or severe AEs, at the discretion of the investigator or sponsor;
If there are “yes” answers on items 4, 5,or on any behavior question of the C -SSRS, 
the participant will be discontinued from treatment and referred to a mental health 
professional for appropriate evaluation and treatment (if the participant cannot be 
seen by amental health professional within 24 hours, then theparticipant should be
senttoalocal emergency room for psychiatric assessment);
PF-06823859
C0251002
Final Protocol Amendment 6, 20September 2021 
PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL
Page 175All of the following laboratory abnormalities require discontinuation if they are 
confirmed (confirmation through re-testing is expected to occur within 1week):
Two sequential AST or ALT elevation ≥3 times the upper limit of norma l with at
least one total bilirubin value ≥2 times the upper limit of normal;a
Two sequential AST or ALT elevation ≥3 times the upper limit of normal
accompanied bysigns orsymptoms consistent with hepatic injury ;a
Two sequential AST or ALT elevation ≥5 times the upper limit of normal,
regardless oftotal bilirubin oraccompany ingsigns or sy mptoms;a
Female participant s found to be pregnant during the study ;
Other serious or severe AEs, after consultation with the Pfizer medical monitor or 
designee.
a.In ea ch case, there is a need for additional investigations, such as revie w of ethanol, recreational drug 
and dietary supplement consumption; testing for acute hepatitis A, B or C infection and biliary tract 
imaging should be promptly discussed with the Pfizer medical monitor or designee.
Use of prohibited medications require participant discontinuation as reflected in 
Appendix 16:
Please refer to Appendix 16for all inclusive prohibited medication listing.
Any participant meeting discontinuation criteria must enter follow -up with their first 
follow -up visit occurring 1 week after their last dose whenever possible, until the event has 
returned to normal or baseline levels or is deemed clinically  stable.  The procedures 
scheduled for the early withdrawal visit will be performed on the last day the participant
takes the IP or as soon as possible thereafter. The only  exception to this is when a participant
specificall y withdraws consent for an y further contact with him/her or persons previously 
authorized by  the participant to provide this information.
Particip ants will be followed post drug discontinuation for 5 months.  Additional follow -up 
visits may  occur as needed until any  clinicall y relevant abnormalities or adverse events have 
resolved, returned to a baseline state, or are deemed clinically  stable.

emergencies, including the COVID -19 pandemic. This appendix applies for theduration of 
the COVID- 19 pandemic globall y and will become effective for other public emergencies 
only upon written notification from Pfizer. 
Use of these alternative study  measures are expected to cease upon the return of business as 
usual circumstances (including the lifting of an y quarantines and travel bans/advisories). 
Telehealth Visits (if applicable)
In the event that in-clinic study  visits cannot be conducted, every  effort should be made to 
follow up on the safet y ofstudy participants at scheduled visits per the Schedule of Activities
or unscheduled visits. Telehealth visits may  be used to continue to assess participant safety  
and collect data points. Telehealth includes the exchange of healthcare i nformation and 
services via telecommunication technologies (eg, audio, video, video- conferencing software) 
remotely , allowing the participant and the investigator to communicate on aspects of clinical 
care, including medical advice, reminders, education, a nd safet y monitoring.
The following assessments may be performed during a telehealth visit:
Review and record an y AEs and SAEs since the last contact.   Refer to Section 8.3, 
and Section 12.4.
Review and record an y new concomitant medications or changes in concomitant 
medications since the last contact.
Review and record contraceptive method .Confirm that the participant is adheri ng to

Home Health Visits (If applicable)
A home health care service will beutilized to facilitate scheduled visits per the Schedule of 
Activities.  Home health visits include a healthcare provider conducting an in- person study  
visit at the participant’s location, rather than an in -person stud y visit at the site. The 
following may  be performed during a home health visit:
Lab Collection;
Physical assessment ;
Vital signs .
Laboratory T esting: (If applicable)
If a stud y participant is unable to visit the site for protocol -specified safety  laboratory  
evaluations, testing may beconducted at a local laboratory  if permitted by  local 
regulations.  The local laboratory  may  be a standalone institution or within a hospital.
The following safet y laboratory evaluations may be performed at a local laboratory: 
Please refer to Table 1of the protocol ; not all laboratory  collections may  be possible.
Hematolog y;
Chemistry ;
Urinaly sis;
Viral Surveillance ( if applicable );
Pregnancy  testing (if applicable );
PK (if applicable) .
If a participant requiring pregnancy  testing cannot visit a local laboratory  for 
pregnancy  testing, a home urine pregnancy  testing kit with a sensitivity of at least 
25IU/mL  may  be used by  the participant to perform the test at home, if compliant 
with local regulatory  requirements. The pregnancy  test outcome should be 
documented in the participant’s source documents/medical records and relevant data 
recorded on the CRF. Confirm that the participant is adhering to the contraception 
method(s) required in the protocol. 
If a local laboratory  is used, qualified stud y site personnel must order, receive, and 
review results. Site staff must c ollect thelocal laboratory  reference ranges and 
certifications/accreditations for filing at the site.   Laboratory  test results are to be 
provided to the site staff as soon as possible.  The local laboratory  reports should

the local laboratory  report should be  recorded on the CRF.
Electrocardiograms (If applicable)
If the participant is unable to visit the study  site for ECGs, the participant may  visit an 
alternative facil ity to have the ECGs performed. Qualified study  site personnel must 
order, receive, and review results. 
Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
If a participant has COVID -19 during the stud y, this should be reported as an adverse 
event (AE) or seriou s adverse events (SAE) and appropriate medical intervention 
provided. There is a potential risk of increased susceptibility to viral infections with 
IFNblockade as with any antagonist of Type 1 interferon signaling 
(eg,anti-IFNAR1, anti -IFN, JAK inhibitors). Viral monitoring will be conducted as 
a precautionary  measure to ensure participant safety . Details can be found in the trial 
protocol as well as the investigators brochure. Temporary  discontinuation of the 
study  intervention may  be medicall y appropriate until the participant has recovered 
from COVID- 19.
It is recommended that the investigator discuss temporary  or permanent 
discontinuation of study  intervention with the study medical monitor.

Birth control methods which may  be considered as highl y effective:
For the purpose of this guidance, methods that can achieve a failure rate of less than 1 % per 
year when used consistently  and correctly  are considered as highl y effective birth control 
methods. Such methods include:
1. C ombined (estrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception associated 
with inhibition of ovulation:1
Oral;
Intravaginal;
Transdermal .
2.progestogen-onl y hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation:1
oral
injectable
implantable .2
3.intrauteri ne device (IUD) .2
4.intrauterine hormone -releasing s ystem (IUS) .2
5.bilateral tubal occlusion .2
6.vasectomised partner .2,3
7. sexual abstinence.4
1. Hormonal contraception may be susceptible to interaction with the IMP, w hich may reduce the efficacy 
of the contraception method .
2. Contraception methods that in the context of this guidance are considered to have low  user dependen cy.
3. Vasectomised partner is a highly effective birth control method provided that partner is the sole sexual 
partner of the WOCBP trial participant and that the vasectomised partner has received medical 
assessment of the surgical success.
4. In the context of this guidance sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if defined 
as refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk associated w ith the study 
treatments. The reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the duration of the 
clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject.

Page 192Appendix 25.Contraceptive and Barrier Guidance
Male Participant Reproductive Inclusion Criteria 
Male participants are eligible to participate if they  agre e to the following requirements during 
the intervention period and for at least 5 months after the last dose of stud y intervention, 
which corresponds to the time needed to eliminate reproductive safet y risk of the study 
intervention. 
Refrain from donating sperm.
PLUS either:
Be abstinent from heterosexual intercourse with a female of childbearing potential as 
their preferred and usual lifesty le (abstinent on a long -term and persistent basis) and 
agree to remain abstinent. 
OR
Must agree to use contraception/barrier as detailed below:
Agree to use a male condom and should also be advised of the benefit for a 
female partner to use a highl y effective method of contraception as a condom may 
break or leak when having sexual intercourse with a woman of childbeari ng 
potential who is not currently  pregnant.
In addition to male condom use, a highl y effective method of contraception may be 
considered in WOCBP partners of male participants (refer to the list of highly  
effective methods below in Appendix 25.4.
Female Participant Reproductive Inclusion Criteria
Female Participant Options :
A female participant is eligible to participate  if she is not pregnant or breastfeeding, and at
least 1 of the following conditions apply .
Is not a WOCBP (see definitions below in Appendix 25.3.
OR
Is a WOCBP and using a contraceptive method that is highly eff ective (with a failure 
rate of <1% per year), preferably with low user dependency , as described below 
during the intervention period and for at least 5 months after the last dose of study  
intervention, which corresponds to the time needed to eliminate any  reproductive 
safet y risk of the stud y intervention. The investigator should evaluate the 
PF-06823859
C0251002
Final Protocol Amendment 6, 20September 2021 
PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL
Page 193effectiveness of the contraceptive method in relationship to the first dose of study 
intervention.
Is a WOCBP and using a contraceptive method that is highly effectiv e (with a failure 
rate of <1% per year), with high user dependency, as described below during the 
intervention period and for at least 5 months after the last dose of study intervention, 
which corresponds to the time needed to eliminate any  reproductive sa fety risk of the 
study  intervention. In addition, a second effective method of contraception, as 
described below, must be used . The investigator should evaluate the effectiveness of 
the contraceptive method in relationship to the first dose of study inte rvention.
The investigator is responsible for review of medical history , menstrual history , and recent 
sexual activity  to decrease the risk for inclusion of a woman with an earl y undetected 
pregnancy . 
Women of Childbearing Potential
A woman is considered fertile following menarche and until becoming post menopausal 
unless permanentl y sterile (see below).
If fertility  is unclear (eg, amenorrhea in adolescents or athletes) and a menstrual cy cle cannot 
be confirmed before the first dose of study  intervention, additional evaluation should be 
considered.
Women in the following categories are not considered WOCBP:
1.Premenopausal female with 1 of the following:
Documented h ysterectomy ;
Documented bilateral salpingectomy ;
Documented bilateral oophorectom y.
For individuals with permanent infertility  due to an alternate medical cause other than 
the above, (eg, mullerian agenesis, androgen insensitivity ), investigator discretion 
should be applied to determining study  entry .
Note: Documentation for any  of the above categories can come from the site 
personnel’s review of the participant’s medical records, medical examination, or 
medical history  interview. The method of documentation should be recorded in the 
participant’s medical record for the stud y.
2.Postmenopausal female:
A postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 months without an 
alternative medical cause.  I n addition:
PF-06823859
C0251002
Final Protocol Amendment 6, 20September 2021 
PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL
Page 194A high FSH level in the postmenopausal range must be used to confirm a 
postmenopausal state in women under 60 years of age and not usi ng hormonal 
contraception or HRT. 
A female on HRT and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use 
one of the nonestrogen hormonal highl y effective contraception methods if they wish 
to continue their HRT during the stud y. Otherwise, they  must discontinue HRT to 
allow confirmation of postmenopausal status before study  enrollment.
Contraception Methods
Contraceptive use b y men or women should be consistent with local availability /regulations 
regarding the use of contraceptive methods for those participating in clinical trials.
Highly Effective Methods That Have Low User Dependency 
1.Implantable progestogen -only hormone contraception associated with inhibition of 
ovulation.
2.Intrauterine device.
3.Intrauterine hormone -releasing s ystem.
4.Bilateral t ubal occlusion (eg, bilateral tubal ligation).
5.Vasectomized partner.
A vasectomized partner is a highl y effective contraceptive method provided that 
the partner is the sole sexual partner of the WOCBP and the absence of sperm has 
been confirmed. If not, a n additional highl y effective method of contraception 
should be used. The spermatogenesis cycle is approximately  90 day s.
Highly Effective Methods That Are User Dependent 
6.Combined (estrogen- and progestogen- containing) hormonal contraception associated 
with inhibition of ovulation:
Oral;
Intravaginal;
Transdermal .
7.Progestogen -only hormone contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation:
Oral;

8.Sexual abstinence:
Sexual abstinence is considered a highl y effective method only  if defined as 
refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk associated 
with the study  intervention. The reliability  of sexual abstinence needs to be 
evaluated in relation to the duration of the stud y and the preferred and usual 
lifesty le of t he participant.
One of the following effective barrier methods must be used in addition to the highl y 
effective methods listed above that are user dependent:
Male or female condom with or without spermicide;
Cervical cap, diaphragm, or sponge with spermici de;
A combination of male condom with either cervical cap, diaphragm, or sponge with 
spermicide (double -barrier methods).

1.0 BACKGROUND  AND  RATIONALE  
1.1 Study  Synopsis  
This single site study is being conducted to evaluate the feasibility and 
acceptability of monitoring lung cancer patients’ disease- and therapy- related  
symptoms remotely  with electronic patient -reported  outcome (ePRO)  surveys. Up 
to 50 patients undergoing treatment and/or surveillance for new or existing  
diagnoses of lung cancer at the University of North Carolina’s Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center will be prospectively enrolled to the use of the mobile medical application Moovcare® for 6 months . Moovcare® automatically 
delivers ePRO surveys on common symptoms experienced by lung cancer patients.  Results  are stored  in a secure  web-based  portal for provider review.  
Concerning survey responses are reported to a designated provider via an email alert.  
 
This study will evaluate and report on: patient  adhe rence  with surveys, patient                       
and provider satisfaction with Moovcare®, quality of life, and survival during the 
study period. 
 
1.2 Background 
In the United States, lung cancer was the third most commonly diagnosed cancer 
(>200,000 cases) and the leading cause of cancer death (>140,000 fatalities) in  
2019.1,2 While the majority of lung cancer patients are at an advanced stage at  
presentation and survival is still less than 20% at 5 years,1 increasing numbers of 
patients are living lo nger due to advances in chemotherapy and immunotherapy 
regimens.  Lung cancer patients are highly symptomatic due to the tumor itself 
and the side effects of multimodal therapy.3 Therefore, strategies for systematic 
outpatient symptom monitoring that lead t o earlier clinician management before 
symptoms become severe and lead to emergency department visits,  
hospitalizations, or other complications  are anticipated  to be clinically  meaningful 
in this group. 
 
Electronic patient -reported outcome (ePRO) surveys can be used to monitor 
symptoms related to disease and treatment remotely in ambulatory patients. ePRO  
monitoring systems automatically deliver surveys that capture symptoms directly  
from patients and alert providers in real- time to concerning responses above 
predetermined symptom severity thresholds. ePRO monitoring has been shown to result in improvement of routine clinical care in the oncology population. In a large randomized controlled trial of advanced cancer patients, ePRO monitoring was asso ciated with reduced emergency department (ED) visits and hospital 
readmissions, improved quality of life (QOL) and patient satisfaction, and  
increased  overall survival, findings supported by other studies.
4-7 
 
Moovcare® is a web -mediated ePRO survey delivery and monitoring system 
designed for the detection  of recurrent lung cancer.  Patients are automatically  
LCCC  2050  
PI: Gita Mody, MD, MPH   CONFIDENTIAL  
UNIVERSITY  OF NORTH  CAROLINA

reminded through emails to complete weekly surveys on symptoms common to 
lung cancer patients. Providers are notified for concerning changes in symptoms based on a previously validated algorithm predictive of lung cancer recurrence.
8 
In prior studies,  lung cancer  recurrence in patients with  advanced  lung cancer  was 
detected  earlier and survival  was improved in  patients using Moovcare®. 8,9 
1.3 Purpose  and Rationale 
The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the feasibility and acceptability of using Moovcare® to monitor symptoms related to complications of treatment 
(surgery, radiotherapy, and/or chemotherapy) and disease recurrence in American  
lung cancer patients as well as to provide preliminary data to inform future  
controlled studies on the association of ePRO monitoring with clinical and quality  
of life outcomes.  
 
The study of the implementation of mobile health information technology (HIT), such as Moovcare®, in diverse patient populations and settings is important to identify and solve barriers to uptake. This study will endeavor to show feasibility of ePRO HIT in patients receiving care at the University of North Carolina  
(UNC), a large public, academic hospital setting. In a separate UNC study 
looking at the feasibility and impact of ePRO monitoring for the initial 90 days after discharge from thoracic surgery  (including lung resection for cancer),  
initial  study experience suggests ePRO use is likely to be feasible in other 
patients with    intrathoracic pathology including lung cancer patients. Evaluating 
compliance with longitudinal ePRO monitoring throughout the treatment and surveillance periods of lung cancer patients will allow protocols for use in multidisciplinary  care to be  developed. 
 
2.0 STUDY  OBJECTIVES  AND  ENDPOINTS  
2.1 Primary  Objectives  
 
2.1.1 The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the feasibility of self- reporting  
symptoms by lung cancer patients using Moovcare®. Feasibility will be defined as the mean  of assigned  weekly  ePRO surveys completed  per patient. 
 
2.1.2 The primary  endpoint will be:  
 
1. ePRO survey completion  rate: the mean  percentage of surveys completed    
per patient by 6 months or coming off study per protocol if sooner. 
 
2.2 Secondary  Objectives  
  
The secondary objectives of the study  will be  to evaluate  the acceptability  of Moovcare®  
(through patient and provider satisfaction  surveys ) and estimate  the overall survival and 
change in the quality of life in patients using Moovcare®.

4.0 Study plan  
4.1 Schema  
 
This is a single  site nonrandomized feasibility study  of approximately  50 
participants  on  treatment  and/or surveillance for new or existing diagnoses of lung 
cancer who will be assigned to a single- arm involving monitoring of their patient -
reported outcomes using a mobile medical  application. The study population will 
include patients with a diagnosis of lung cancer  undergoing outpatient treatment or

 surveillance at  UNC.  Patients will be recruited from the Multidisciplinary Thoracic 
Oncology Program (MTOP) clinics at UNC over 10-12 months and undergo ePRO 
monitoring for 6 months or until criteria for coming off study are met, whichever 
comes first. Study procedures include monitoring of patient symptoms using automated weekly PRO surveys delivered by Moovcare® and assessment of 
outcomes including quality of life at baseline and 3- month intervals, as well as 
patient satisfaction at 6 months using the UNC  REDCap electronic survey delivery 
software platform. Other clinical outcomes including                         health care utilization, 
recurrence, and survival will be abstracted at any time after enrollment from the 
medical record into the UNC REDCap database. Provider satisfaction will be  
assessed  via electronic  survey  after the study has been open to enrollment for at 
least 6 months. 
 
4.2 Duration of Study  
 
This study will last for approximately 2 years. Training of providers will take 
place prior to enrollment starts. Approximately 50 participants will be  enrolled 
over 1 year. Each  participants’  participation  in the study will last                           up to 6 months  
or until the patient comes off -study due to transition to hospice, death, or 
withdrawal from the study. Study analysis of participant data will take  place  
throughout the  study duration and at the  conclusion. 
 
4.3 Study  Details  
 
Overview 
The study involves two types of repeating surveys: weekly PRO surveys delivered by e-mail via Moovcare® and periodic outcomes surveys delivered by e- mail via the UNC REDCap  platform, a secure web -based server, or 
collected on paper in the clinic. PRO responses are managed by providers 
through a combination of reports graphically displaying responses over time and e- mail                                  alerts about concerning levels or combinations of symptoms. 
Provider response to  ePRO reports and alerts may l ead to earlier or different 
management than routine clinical care and so potentially impact health care 
utilization and  clinical outcomes. For all surveys (Moovcare® PRO and 
REDCap outcome  surveys), participants’ caregivers (family, friends) may 
assist wit h completion in any way the participant chooses. The study 
coordinator may also provide technical  assistance.  
 
Screening, Recruitm
 ent, and Enrollment 
Potentially eligible patients will be identified from the review of the visit reason 
from the thoracic onc ology providers’ Epic clinic schedules. Patients who have 
appointments for outpatient care at Multidisciplinary Thoracic Oncology Program 
(postoperative clinic  visit, any radiation, or oncology visit) will be considered. To 
identify  potentially  eligible patients, the study coordinator can review clinical 
documentation such as the  patient’s chart in the electronic medical record, 
clinical schedules, or ask  clinical staff about potential eligible patients through a 
limited HIPAA waiver from the IRB . Providers will also be approached by the 
study coordinator to identify  any other  patients with lung cancer.  
LCCC  2050  
PI: Gita Mody, MD, MPH   CONFIDENTIAL  
UNIVERSITY  OF NORTH  CAROLINA

Identified patients will be entered into a screening log. Providers will be asked to  
verify a clinical diagnosis of lung cancer. For surgical pat ients,  lack of enrollment 
in concurrent LCCC protocol #1945 will be verified                     with the assigned study 
coordinator. Patients meeting the eligibility criteria on the initial screening will 
be approached in person, by telephone by the study coordinator to verify the remainder of the eligibility criteria  and invite the patient to the study. Interested  
patients will undergo informed consent procedures. An IRB-approved study team 
member will  approach the patient to discuss study procedures, benefits, risks and 
obtain informed consent prior to any study procedures. Patients who agree to 
participate  will review and sign the informed consent form after the study is 
explained and  questions have been  answered.   
 
Patients who are found to be ineligible during screening due to lack of email, phone number, or English language or those potentially eligible during screening but found to be ineligible after contact will be excluded from the study. The reasons for exclusion as well as basic demographics available in the EMR (e.g. race, ethnicity, age, gender, education level if available) will be collected in REDCap.  
 For patients who are eligible but refuse enrollment, reasons for refusal, as well as basic demographics available in the EMR ( e.g. race, ethnicity, age, gender, 
education level if available) will also be collected within REDCap .  
 Moovcare®  Registra
 tion and Use 
After enrollment, participants will be registered and receive a log -in ID for the  
Moovcare® website.  Participants will b e trained by the study coordinator on 
the purpose of ePRO monitoring and how to log in and self-report PROs using the Moovcare® application. Participants will be instructed that any time a severe or worsening symptom is reported, their care team will be alerted but that the alert will only be received during business hours. If there is a severe  
symptom warranting attention outside of business hours, participants will be instructed  to contact the care team directly  or visit the  emergency  room. 
Participants should be informed that this system cannot be counted on as the sole means of communicating  problems to  their care team, and  that any time a 
concerning symptom occurs, they should consider contacting a health care provider or calling  911 as they  would do if participating  in the study. 
 
The Moovcare® survey system asks questions about common symptoms lung cancer patients experience, specifically about loss of weight, loss of appetite,  
dyspnea, depression, cough, pain, fever, hemoptysis, subcutaneous nodules, dysphonia, and superior vena cava syndrome. 
 
The Moovcare® application will notify the patient via email on a weekly basis during daytime hours to complete a scheduled symptom survey within 24 hours. If the patient does not complete the scheduled Moovcare® survey by the deadline, the 
system will generate e- mail reminders. If the survey is not completed after 48-72 
hours, the study coordinator may also contact patients for a reminder. Participants 
LCCC  2050  
PI: Gita Mody, MD, MPH   CONFIDENTIAL  
UNIVERSITY  OF NORTH  CAROLINA  
April 19, 2022  
7  
 will have the option to report symptoms via Moovcare® more often as needed.  
 
Before study initiation, the study coordinator will train all providers on the 
MTOP team on use of the Moovcare® portal, intended use of ePROs for symptom monitoring and management, and logging on and viewing ePRO results in the portal between and during clinic visits. Providers will also be  
trained  on the  need  to document management  of ePRO symptoms in  the 
regular medical  record (i.e. Epic)  per service routine.  
 
Provider Alerts  and Rep
 orts 
Members of the MTOP  care team(s)  will be assigned  to each participant within  
the Moovcare® portal. ePRO survey symptoms that are severe and/or meet the Moovcare®  algorithm for lung cancer  recurrence prediction  will generate an 
email alert to a desi gnated clinical care team member.  Any free text addressing  
“other” symptoms will also generate an  email alert. The  care team  will follow 
their usual protocols for management of symptoms which may include calling patient for more information or to manage the issue, scheduling an appointment or 
testing, and/or referring to the emergency room amongst other management strategies. At any time, the MTOP care team members can review an assigned  
participant’s  record  to determine whether an  alert  is present  and to review the 
prior ePRO symptom survey responses. If the providers did not view the alert in 
48 hours, patients will get a message to contact their health care provider. T he 
unattended alerts will also be escalated  to the research coordinator who will 
communicate it with the clinical team. The study coordinator will have access to  
all enrolled  participants’ Moovcare® records to facilitate  review  of results.  
 
Outcome Surveys 
At enrollment, all participants will be trained by the study coordinator how to  
use the UNC REDCap online system  to complete  outcomes surveys for the trial. 
The outcomes surveys will be completed  by all participants  at baseline;  HRQOL  
will be reassessed at months 3, 6 /off-study (+/ - 4 weeks  each) and patient 
satisfaction at 6 months /off-study (+/ -4 weeks). Participants will be given a 
choice to complete from home electronically, or if necessary,  in clinic at 
otherwise scheduled routine  follow-up visits  which  occur at least every  3 months 
or via phone call  (with  the study coordinator entering the data after participant 
paper completion  into REDCap ). For home electronic  completion, the outcomes 
surveys will be sent when  due by email via REDCap. The REDCap will send 
automatic reminders  for incomplete surveys. If the patient does not self- complete 
this information, the  study coordinator also ha s the option to call or email them 
to collect the information and then enter it into  REDCap.  If the patient goes off 
study                 prior to week 26, the study coordinator will contact the patient as soon as  
possible to get the  off-study  surveys completed. 
 The patient outcomes surveys include: 
• Participant Demographics Form: This form asks participants about  
their basel ine information including full name  and date of birth  and 
will be administered at the time of  enrollment.  
• Quality of Life Questionnaires: Health -related quality of life will be  
LCCC  2050  
PI: Gita Mody, MD, MPH   CONFIDENTIAL  
UNIVERSITY  OF NORTH  CAROLINA  
April 19, 2022  
8  
 assessed by items from the European Organisation for Research and  
Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Comprehensive 30 
(EORTC- QLQ -C30) and Quality  of Life Questionnaire  Lung Cancer  13 
module (EORTC -QLQ- LC13), which will be administered to each  
patient participant at baseline, months 3, 6/off - study (+/- 4 weeks 
each). The EORTC is a well -established and  frequently used 
questionnaire that includes a 5 -item physical  functioning domain, 
individual symptom items including symptoms  specific to lung cancer  
patients, and a composite quality  of life score.  
• Patient Satisfaction Survey: The patient satisfaction survey will be  
administered to each participant at baseline  and 6 months of participation 
(+/- 4 weeks). The satisfaction questions are from the Consumer 
Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS)  survey system, 
which is maintained by the Agency for Healthcare Research  and Quality 
(AHRQ), to support and promote the assessment of consumers' experiences 
with health care, and from the “Patient- Centered  Communication in Cancer 
Care” short form and validated instrument (PCC - CA-6). No total score is 
calculated, but individual items will be summarized  and reported. 
 
Chart  Abstraction  Form 
The study coordinator will abstract information from the medical chart and/or touch base with the cl inical team caring for participants to assess  
clinical outcomes including if the patient has died, been hospitalized or admitted to the emergency department or urgent care, or had recurrence, progression, or death at any time after enrollment  and at off study. This form 
will collect relevant medical information, including dates and diagnoses related to ER visits and   hospitalizations, prescription of selective supportive 
medications, dates of  changes and/or discontinuation of cancer  treatments , 
and initiation  of hospice services.  
 
Provider Satisfaction  Survey 
The amount of staff effort  for PRO- related  activities  will be assessed  based  
on data completed by the MTOP nurses and physicians involved in 
managing PRO data. The provider satisfaction survey will be completed at  
least 6 months from the time the initial  participant is  enrolled. The study 
coordinator will ask the providers to complete the form on paper and then immediately upload the results into REDCap or directly enter survey results  
into REDCap by tablet or computer emailed survey link.  The provider  
survey satisfaction may be repeated during the study duration particularly if changes to the  Moovcare®  interface  or protocol are  made.  
 
Off-Study Timing  and P
 rocedures 
Participants are asked to remain on the study completing surveys for 6 months 
(26 week ly ePROs ), or until they go off-study prior to that time. An “Off-study 
form”  requiring information to be abstracted from the participant’s medical 
record will be complet ed by the study coordinator when the participant goes off 
study (+ 4- week  window for form completion). Consultation with MTOP 
physician or nurse may be necessary for clarifications of some of the questions in 
LCCC  2050  
PI: Gita Mody, MD, MPH   CONFIDENTIAL  
UNIVERSITY  OF NORTH  CAROLINA

 this form. For example, this form includes information about reasons and timing 
for the reasons  for going off -study. In addition, the final chart abstraction form 
will also be  completed (see above) when going off study. In addition, if a patient 
goes off study early for any reason other than death, the coordinator will attempt 
to contact the patient to complete  the final Outcomes Questionnaires (including: 
“Patient Quality of Life” and  “Patient  Satisfaction”) as soon as possible.  
Some of the reasons for patients  going  off-study include: 
• Completion  of 6 months ( 26 weeks)  of participation  
• Initiation  of hospice 
• Death  
• Moved to a different practice  for lung cancer  care 
• Voluntary disenrollment  
• Lost to follow -up 
• Removal by principal investigator  
 
Incentives 
Participants will be informed at the time of recruitment they will be given a $25  
incentive for participation (at enrollment in the  Moovcare® portal).  
 
4.4 Expected  Risks  
 
Expected risks for this study are likely minimal and involve psychosocial harms such as emotional distress or embarrassment related to survey questions and  
breach of confidentiality. Survey questions are similar to questions used in the clinical setting an d therefore are unlikely to cause harm. However, should a 
patient experience emotional distress stemming from these questions, a  
psychology consult through the Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Support Program will be obtained. Risk of confidentiality breach  will be minimized in  
several  ways as detailed  below: 
 
1. Moovcare® is a web -mediated algorithm where patients enter symptom data  
through a password- secure web platform.  Enrolled participants are given a 
unique password to log on to the site so only they, a c aregiver with whom 
they share the password, and their assigned clinical care team can access their PRO data. Other study data including outcomes questionnaires and chart abstraction forms will be collected through the University of North Carolina (UNC) RED Cap web -based platform for secure survey 
administration.  
2. The REDCap system is a secure, HIPAA -compliant web-based application 
to support distributed data collection governed by standard University, 
School of Medicine, and Federal information security policies and standards. 
The REDCap  application  is hosted and monitored on a secure server  located  
within the UNC CTSA- funded NC TraCS Institute’s Bioinformatics Core.  
Access to the REDCap database for this study will be restricted to authorized re search team members as needed to perform their job functions. 
Research  staff who access the REDCap system will use a unique user ID 
LCCC  2050  
PI: Gita Mody, MD, MPH   CONFIDENTIAL  
UNIVERSITY  OF NORTH  CAROLINA  
April 19, 2022  
10  
 provided by the Bioinformatics Core. Each time research staff access 
REDCap, a unique username and password (login) is required, and REDCap maintains an audit trail of all activity . 
3. Strict confidentiality will be maintained. Hard -copy research data will be 
minimal and stored in locked, secure areas accessible only by the study team.  Research data will be maintained in separate charts and identified by 
ID number only when possible. A master list connecting names and ID 
numbers will be kept in a separate, secure location. Only IRB-approved 
members of the  research team will have access to secured files and will be 
educated regarding  the protection of patients’  rights  to confidentiality.  At 
study completion, when  the database has been  declared  to be complete  and 
accurate,  the database will be  locked. 
4. Data transmitted between the server and end -users are encrypted using SSL,  
and all databases are encrypted. Only study team members will have access 
to data stored in REDCap, and they will use their UNC ONYEN to gain 
access.  Research team members will be instructed to keep all participant 
data and  patient  participation confidential.  
5. Approaching patients about enrollment in the clinic poses a risk to privacy.  
We anticipate this risk to be low. To avoid threats of coercion, providers 
will be educated but not directly  involved with recruitment of patients.  
 
4.5 Removal of Patients  from  Protocol 
Patients  will be removed from the study  if: 
• they experience significant emotional distress in response to mobile remote  monitoring 
• they indicate  that they no longer wish  to participate

 6.1 Definition  
As defined by UNC’s IRB, unanticipated problems involving risks to study 
subjects or others  (UPIRSO)  refers  to any incident, experience,  or outcome that:  
• Is unexpected (in terms of nature, severity, or frequency) given (a) the  
research  procedures that are  described  in the protocol- related  
documents, such as the IRB -approved research protocol and informed 
consent document; and (b) the characteristics of the subject population being studied;Is related  or possibly related  to a subject’s participation  
in the research;  and 
• Suggests that the research  places  subjects or others  at a greater risk  of 
harm (including physical, psychological, economic, or social  harm) related  
to the research than was previously known or recognized. 
 
6.2 Reporting  
Any UPIRSO that occurs during the conduct of this study and that meets all three 
criteria listed in 6.1 must be reported to the UNC IRB using the IRB’s web -based  
reporti
ng system.  
 
7.0 STATISTICAL  CONSIDERATIONS  
7.1 Study  Design  
This is a nonrandomized, single- center, interventional study. The project will  
prospectively enroll eli gible lung cancer patients undergoing outpatient treatments  
to a single arm entailing monitoring with weekly patient-reported outcomes surveys linked to automated provider reporting. Outcomes will be measured serially  over the course of the study using  surveys and chart abstraction.  
 
The primary objective of this study is to evaluate feasibility, acceptability, and 
adherence with survey  completion at the patient level. Secondary objectives 
include estimating the  overall survival  and change in  quality of life  in patients 
using Moovcare®.  
 
7.2 Sample  Size and Accrual  
The primary objective is to estimate the percentage of available surveys completed by eligible, enrolled patients. Based on other PRO studies including at UNC, approximately 80% of assigned surveys are comp leted per patient.  
 
The Multidisciplinary Thoracic Oncology Program (MTOP) at the UNC Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer  Center  sees a patient  population representation  
of the state of North  Carolina  including  approximately  20% African  American  
and 60% female patients. An estimated 600 patients with lung cancer diagnoses are seen each year.  Based on other studies on PROs at UNC institutions, it is 
estimated  that 50% of patients  meeting  screening  criteria  will be otherwise  
eligible  and enroll., I t will take  an anticipated 12 months to enroll  the target  of 50 
patients.

 data will be entered into the REDCap  database via web -based administration.  
Abstracted  medical  record  data also will be entered  into a REDCap  study- specific 
database.  Moovcare® employs a secure database  that is password  protected. 
The REDCap system is a secure, HIPAA -compliant web-based application to 
support distributed data collection governed by standard University, School of 
Medicine, and Federal information security policies and standards. The REDCap application is hosted and monitored on a secure server located within the UNC  
CTSA -funded NC TraCS Institute’s Bioinformatics Core. Access to the REDCap  
database for this study will be restricte d to authorized research team members as 
needed to perform their job functions. Research staff who access the REDCap system will use a unique user ID provided by the Bioinformatics Core. Each time research staff access REDCap, a unique username and password (login) is 
required, and REDCap maintains an audit trail of all activity.  Data transmitted 
between the server  and end-users are encrypted  using SSL,  and all databases are 
encrypted. 
 
Adverse events (AEs)  and serious AE collection  and reporting:  
Adverse events (AEs) will be defined as any untoward or unexpected events or outcomes related or possibly related to a subject’s participation in the ePROs.  
AEs will include any breach in confidentiality or embarrassment with reporting  
PRO symptoms and phy sical functioning. Delays in management of reported  
symptoms or complications and readmissions related to the patient’s underlying  
condition or operative care will not be considered an adverse event related to the study as patients will be informed that an y concerning symptoms or other issue 
may require calling the clinic or after -hours phone number (provided via the 
software  system)  or presentation to the emergency  room, consistent  with standard  
of care.  
 
Serious AEs are not anticipated in patients  related  to undergoing use of the ePRO  
survey system or by participating in surveys for feedback on the ePRO system given the minimal risks of the study procedures. Similarly, serious AEs are not anticipated  in providers completing surveys  about their exper ience using the 
Moovcare® application portal . 
 AEs will be elicited in the free text portion of the ePRO survey. Any AEs and serious AEs will  be reported to the UNC IRB using the IRB’s web- based 
reporting system and per protocol. 
 
The Principal Investigato r is responsible for continuous monitoring of patient 
safety  in this trial with periodic  reporting to the  Data  and Safety Monitoring 
Committee (DSMC) as required.   The unattended alerts will be escalated to 
the research coordinator who will communicate it with the clinical team. 
Reports of aggregate PRO responses will be provided by the statistician monthly for review  at team meetings.  
 
Meetings/teleconferences will be held at a frequency dependent on study accrual, and in consultation with the study Biostatistician.  At these meetings, the research  
team will discuss all issues relevant to study progress, including enrollment,

 safety, regulatory, data collection, etc. and the team will produce summaries or 
minutes of these meetings. These summaries will  be available for inspection when 
requested by any of the regulatory bodies charged with the safety of human subjects and the integrity of data including, but not limited to, the oversight (Office of Human Research Ethics (OHRE) Biomedical IRB, the Oncolog y 
Protocol Review  Committee  (PRC)  or DSMC).  
 
8.0 STUDY  MANAGEMENT  
8.1 Institutional Review  Board  (IRB)  Approval and Consent  
It is expected that the IRB will have the proper representation and function in  
accordance with federally mandated regulations.  The IRB should approve the  
consent form and protocol.  
 
In obtaining and documenting informed consent, the investigator should comply with the applicable regulatory requirement(s) and should adhere to Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and to ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration  
of Helsinki.  
 
Before recruitment and enrollment onto this study, the patient will be given a full explanation of the study and will be given the opportunity to review the consent form.  Each  consent form  must  include all the relevant  elements currently  required 
by the FDA Regulations and local or state regulations. Once this essential  
information has been provided to the patient and the investigator is assured that the patient understands the implications of participating in the study, the patient will be asked to give consent to participate in the study by signing or agreeing to 
verbally an IRB-approved consent form. 
 
Prior to a patient’s participation in the trial, the written informed consent form 
should be signed and personally dated by the patient and by the person who conducted the informed consent discussion. In cases when written informed consent cannot be obtained, telephone consent will be  obtained, and a copy of 
the consent sent to the  participant.  
 
8.2 Required  Documentation 
Before the study can be initiated at any site, the following documentation must be provided to the Office of Clinical & Translational Research (OCTR) at the 
University of North  Carolina.  
• A copy of the official IRB approval letter for the protocol  
• A copy of the IRB -approved consent form  
8.3 Registration  Procedures 
All subjects must be registered with the Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, and entered into the web based clinical research platform, Oncore®. Patient enrollment will also be documented a password                    protected excel spread 
sheet stored on a shared drive managed by Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer  
Center’s encrypted server.

8.4 Adherence to the Protocol 
Except for an emergency  situation  in which  proper care for the protection,  safety,  
and well- being of the study patient requires alternative treatment, the study shall 
be conducted exactly  as described  in the  approved protocol. 
 
8.4.1 Emergency  Modifications  
UNC investigators  may implement a deviation from, or a change of, the protocol  
to eliminate an immediate hazard(s) to trial subjects without prior UNC IRB  
approval. 
 
For any such emergency modification implemented, a UNC IRB modification 
form must be completed by UNC Research Personnel within five (5) business  
days of making  the change.  
 
8.4.2 Single  Patient/Subject  Exceptions  
Eligibility single subject exceptions are not permitted for Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center Investigator Initiated Trials  under any 
circumstances.  Other  types  of single subject exception s may be allowed  if proper 
regulatory review has been completed in accordance with Lineberger  
Comprehensive Cancer Center’s Single Subject Exceptions Policy.  
 
8.4.3 Other  Protocol Deviations/Violations  
According to UNC’s  IRB,  a protocol deviation is any unplanned variance from an 
IRB approved protocol that: 
• Is generally  noted or  recognized after it occurs  
• Has no substantive effect on  the risks  to research  participants  
• Has no substantive effect  on the scientific  integrity  of the research  plan 
or the value of the data collected  
• Did not result  from  willful  or knowing misconduct on the part of the 
investigator(s).  
An unplanned protocol variance is considered a violation  if the v ariance meets 
any of the following  criteria:  
• Has harmed  or in creased  the risk of harm to one or more  research  
participants.  
• Has damaged the scientific  integrity  of the data collected  for the study. 
• Results from  willful or knowing misconduct on the part of the 
investigator(s).  
• Demonstrates  serious or continuing noncompliance with federal  
regulations, State  laws, or University  policies.  
 
If a deviation  or violation  occurs,  please follow  the guidelines below: 
 
Protocol Deviations: UNC personnel will record the deviation in OnCore® (or 
other appropriate database set up for the study), and report to any sponsor or data and safety monitoring committee in accordance with their policies.  Deviations  
should be summarized and  reported to the IRB at the time of continuing review.  
LCCC  2050

17  
 Participant -initiated changes from recommended symptom monitoring schedule 
(ie- non-adherence) will not be considered protocol deviations. A protocol 
deviation would only be recorded if the staff and its systems (i.e. Moovcare® or 
REDCap ) did not initiate/reach out to patients to administer the appropriate 
surveys or deliver appropriate alerts. Provider not viewing/managing the alert is not considered a deviation.  Events will be documented in OnCore, but not reported to the IRB unless it is 
due to a related AE or SAE. UNC personnel will record the deviation in OnCore®, and report to any sponsor or data and safety monitoring committee in accordance with their policies.   
 
Protocol Violations: Violations should be reported  by UNC personnel within  one 
(1) week of the investigator becoming aware of the event using the same IRB online mechanism used to report UPIRSO. 
 
Unanticipated Problems Involving Risks to Subjects or Others (UPIRSO):  
Any events that meet the criter ia for “Unanticipated Problems” as defined by 
UNC’s  IRB (see section  6.1) must be  reported by the Study Coordinator using  the 
IRB’s  web-based reporting system.  
8.5 Amendments  to the Protocol 
Should amendments to the protocol be required, the amendments will be originated and documented by the Principal Investigator at UNC.  It should also 
be noted that when an amendment to the protocol substantially alters the study design or the potential risk to the patient, a revised consent form might be  
required. 
 
The written  amendment, and if required the amended consent  form,  must be sent 
to UNC’s  IRB for approval prior to implementation.  
 
8.6 Record  Retention  
Study documentation includes all Case Report Forms, data correction forms or queries, source documents, Sponsor- Investigator correspondence, monitoring 
logs/letters, and regulatory documents (e.g., protocol and amendments, IRB correspondence and approval, signed patient consent forms).  Source 
documents include all recordings of observations or notations of clinical  
activities and all reports and records necessary for the evaluation and  
reconstruction of the clinical research study.  
 
Government agency regulations and directives require that all study  
documentation pertaining to the conduct of a clinical trial must be retained by the study investigator. In the case of a study with a drug seeking regulatory approval and marketing, these documents shall be retained for at least two years after the  
last approval of marketing application in an International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) region.  In all other cases, study documents should be kept 
on file until three years after the completion and final study report of this  
investigational study.

8.7 Obligations  of Investigators  
The Principal Investigator is responsible for the conduct of the clinical trial at the  
site in accordance with Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations and/or the 
Declaration of Helsinki.  The Principal Investigator is responsible for personally 
overseeing the treatment of all study patients. The Principal Investigator must 
assure that all study site personnel, including sub-investigators and other study 
staff members, adhere to the study protocol and all FDA/GCP/NCI regulations and guidelines regarding clinical  trials  both during and after  study completion.  
 The Principal Investigator at each institution or site will be responsible for assuring that all the required data will be collected and entered onto the Case Repo rt Forms.  Periodically,  monitoring  visits  will be conducted and the Principal 
Investigator will provide access to his/her original records to permit verification  
of proper entry of data. At the completion of the study, all case report forms will  
be reviewed by the Principal Investigator and will require his/her final signature  
to verify  the accuracy  of the data.

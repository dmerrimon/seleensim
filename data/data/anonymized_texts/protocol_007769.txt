 1.   SUMMARY  
 
 
Sponsor  Investigator:  Sheldon L. Kaplan,  MD 
Sponsor:  Baylor College  of Medicine  
Funding:   Allergan  
Product  Name: Ceftaroline  
Protocol  Title:  Phase  1/2 Trial of Ceftaroline  for the Treatment  of Hematogenously  Acquired 
Staphylococcus aureus  Osteomyelitis  in Children  
Clinical  Phase:  1/2 
Objectives:  
Primary:  
• Evaluate  the safety  of ceftaroline  in pediatric  subjects  1 to 17 years  of age (inclusive)  with  
acute  hematogenous  osteomyelitis at the end of intravenous  therapy.  
Secondary:  
• Evaluate  efficacy  of ceftaroline  in pediatric  subjects  with  acute  hematogenous  osteomyelitis  
at the end of IV therapy,  at the end of total  therapy  (anticipated to be  at 4 to 6 weeks  after  
enrollment),  and at one year after  enrollment.  
• Evaluate  clearance  of S. aureus  bacteremia  if blood cultures  initially  positive.  
• Assess proportion  of patients  with  plasma  levels  of ceftaroline  that exceed  1 µg/mL  for 
over  60%  of a dosing interval.  
Study  Design:  This is a Phase  1/2, open -label,  single -center  study  to determine  safety and 
tolerability  of ceftaroline  in pediatric  subjects  1 to 17 years  of age  (inclusive)  with  signs  and 
symptoms  of acute  hematogenous  osteomyelitis at the end of intravenous  therapy.  After  
informed  consent/assent is obtained,  ceftaroline  will be administered  intravenously.  After  the 
subject  has been afebrile  for at least  48 hours,  has negative  blood cultures,  is clearly  improving  
in general,  is able  to eat and drink,  and is able  to use or move  the involved  extremity,  the subject  
may  be switched  to oral antibiotic  administration.  
Number  of Subjects:  18 Children  1 to 17 years  of age, inclusive.  Each  subject  will receive  
ceftaroline.  2 subjects  above  5 years  old will be enrolled  before  the younger  subjects  are 
enrolled.  
Planned  Study  Period:  Approximately  60 months  (funding  approval  to last subject last visit).  
6 subjects /year  enrollment is anticipated.  
Treatment  Duration  with  ceftaroline: Approximately  5 to 14 days.  
Subject  Participation:   The duration of subject  participation from  signing the  informed consent  
form  will be up to 14  months  (includes  screening period,  study  drug administration,  oral drug  
administration  and a follow -up visit 12 months  after  the last  dose  of study  drug).   Baseline  
assessments  for study  eligibility  will occur within  24 hours  before  the first dose  of study  drug  
except  for Alkaline  Phosphatase, Bilirubin,  AST/ALT  which will be obtained  prior to 
administration  of ceftaroline  but the results  may  not be available.  A minimum  of 2 days  (48 
hours)  of study  drug administration  is required  to assess  safety.

Test  Product,  Dosage,  and Mode  of Administration: IV ceftaroline  fosamil  15 mg/kg  (or 600 mg if > 
40 kg) infused  over  120 (± 10) minutes  q8h (± 1 hour)  for children  2 years  of age – 17 years  of age 
(inclusive).  IV ceftaroline  fosamil  10 mg/kg  infused  over  120 (± 10) minutes  q 8h (± 1 hour)  for children 
from 1 year  of age to < 2 years  (inclusive).  
Isolate  susceptibilities: The ceftaroline  MIC of S. aureus  isolates  or other  isolates  such as Group A 
streptococcus,  Streptococcus  pneumoniae or Kingella  kingae  that are obtained  from  the patients  
with acute  hematogenous  osteomyelitis  will be determined  using  Clinical and Laboratory  Standards  
Institute (CLSI)  methods.  These  will be performed  in the CAP certified  Infectious  Disease  Research  
Laboratory.  CLSI interpretive  breakpoints  will be used  to determine  if the isolate  is susceptible,  
intermediate  or resistant  to ceftaroline.  
Oral  Switch:  A switch  to one of the following  open -label  PO drugs  is expected/allowed  on or after  
EOIV  assessments are completed  and if criteria  in Section  9.2 are met:  
• PO clindamycin  13 mg/kg/dose  q8h in subjects  with  proven  MRSA infection  due to clindamycin  
susceptible  MRSA  or if no pathogen  is isolated.  
OR 
• PO cephalexin  25 to 33 mg/kg/dose  q 8 hours  in subjects with  proven  MSSA  infection.  
OR 
• PO linezolid  600 mg q12h  (Children > 12 years  old) or 10 mg/kg  q8h (children  < 12 years  old) in 
subjects  with  clindamycin -resistant  MRSA pathogens  or for patients  with  MRSA  isolates  who  are 
unable  to tolerate  clindamycin.  
Inclusion Criteria:  Subjects  are required  to meet  the following  inclusion criteria:  
1. Informed  consent  in writing from  parent(s)  or other  legally  acceptable  representative(s)  and 
assent from  subject  (if appropriate  according to local  requirements).  
2. Male  or female  1 to 17 years  of age. 
3. Suspected hematogenous  SA osteomyelitis  in a large  bone  (upper  or lower  extremities,  pelvis)  
based  on clinical findings  and radiology  results.  
4. One to three  sites  of osteomyelitis  with expectation that transition to oral  antibiotics  will be 
likely  prior to discharge  to complete IV therapy  (The  second  or third  site might  be contiguous  
like a proximal  tibia  and distal  femur  but could also  be at sites  unrelated  such as a distal  femur  
and pelvic  bone).  
5. Female  subjects  who  have  reached  menarche  must  have  a negative  urine  pregnancy  test.  
6. Female  subjects  who  have  reached  menarche  and are sexually  active  must  be willing to practice  
sexual  abstinence  or dual  methods  of birth  control  (eg, condom  or diaphragm with spermicidal 
foam  or gel) during treatment and  for at least  28 days  after the last dose  of any study  drug.  
7. Sufficient IV access to receive medication.

Exclusion Criteria:  Subjects  must  NOT  meet  any of the following  exclusion  criteria.  Septic  arthritis  
contiguous  to the site of osteomyelitis  is not an exclusion criterion.  
1. Received  more  than  24 hours  of IV antibiotics  prior  to enrollment.  
2. More  than  three bones  infected.  
3. Disseminated  infection  or is admitted to the pediatric  intensive  care  unit.  
4. Underlying  condition (excludes  mild  eczema  or reactive  airways  disease).  
5. Suspected  or proven  venous  thrombosis  or concern  for endocarditis.  
6. Requirement for other  reasons  for another  antibiotic  potentially  active  against  organisms  
commonly  causing  osteomyelitis in children.  
7. Creatinine  clearance  < 50 mL/min/1.73m2  (calculated by  the Schwartz  formula).  
8. AST or ALT > 3 times  the upper  limit  of normal.  
9. Neutropenia  (<500  neutrophils/mm3). 
10. Thrombocytopenia (<50,000  platelets/mm3). 
11. Females  who  are currently pregnant  or breast  feeding.  
12. Hypersensitivity  reaction to  any Beta -lactam  antibiotic.  
13. Has had an allergic  reaction to ceftaroline  in the past. 
Safety:  Adverse  event  and serious  adverse  event  monitoring,  vital  signs  and laboratory  tests  
(CBC,BUN,  Creatinine, Alkaline  Phosphatase,  Bilirubin, AST  and ALT will be obtained  within  24 hours  
prior  to enrollment  and weekly  during ceftaroline  treatment  and at the completion of ceftaroline  
treatment).   The Alkaline  Phosphatase,  Bilirubin,  AST/ALT  results  may  not be available  prior  to 
enrollment  of the patient.  We do not anticipate  that the AST/ALT  concentrations  will be > 3 UNL  but 
if they  were  to be this elevated,  the subject  will be dropped  from  the study  immediately.  
Efficacy:  
• Clinical response  by subject  and by  baseline  pathogen at the conclusion  of IV  ceftaroline.  
• Clinical outcome  at the completion  of total  therapy  (IV plus oral)  
• Clinical outcome  at one year  after enrollment into  study -long -term  follow -up. 
Pharmacokinetics:   The pharmacokinetic  (PK) outcome  measures  will include  concentrations  of 
ceftaroline,  ceftaroline  fosamil (prodrug),  and ceftaroline  M-1 (inactive  metabolite)  in plasma  in 
subjects on days  2 to 5 of treatment (only  one PK sample  collected  on days  2-5) 4 hours  (+/- 30 
minutes) after  the end of the infusion (before  the start  of the next infusion).  Efforts  will be made  to 
obtain  1 PK blood  sample  (approximately  0.6 mL) at steady  state  from  all subjects who  receive  
ceftaroline  fosamil.  PK samples  may  be collected  after any infusion of ceftaroline  fosamil on those  
days  and before  oral switch.  
 
If purulent  material  is being  obtained  from  bone  or subperiosteal  abscesses  at surgery  or via 
drainage  by interventional  radiology,  we will attempt  to obtain  specimens for  measurement  of 
ceftaroline  concentrations.  
Statistics:  
• Descriptive statistical  methods  will be used  to summarize  the demographic  characteristics  of the 
subjects  as well as selected  clinical features  such  as duration  of fever  or positive  blood  cultures,  
time  until  normalization  of ESR and CRP.  
• The proportion of children  with plasma  concentrations  of ceftaroline  that exceed  1µg/mL  at 4 
hours  following  a 2 hour  infusion of ceftaroline  dose  will be determined.  
• Safety  analyses  will be conducted on all subjects who received  at least  one dose  of ceftaroline.  
The occurrence  of adverse  events  especially  diarrhea,  rash  and evidence  of bone  marrow  
suppression  which  are the most  common adverse  effects  associated  with cephalosporin  
antibiotics  will be evaluated.

Abbreviations:  AE =  adverse  event;  CBC = complete blood  count;  CrCl = creatinine clearance;  CRP = C-reactive protein;  ESR = erythrocyte  sedimentation  rate;  SAE = serious adverse  event.  
1 Perform  baseline  assessments within 24 hours before  first dose  of IV study  drug.  
2 Interval  history  focusing  on the  use of the involved extremity.  On Month 12 follow  up interval problems such as pathologic fractures  and growth disturbances will be evaluated  only.  
3 The presence of  warmth,  tenderness,  swelling,  erythema,  and movement  of the  infected extremity will be recorded specifically.  The circumference of the infected extremity taken at the location of 
point  tenderness will be determined.  
4 Involved  extremity will be assessed as at enrollment, if possible.  Most of the subjects  are expected  to have  surgical incision  and drainage procedures  and thus assessing the extremity for swelling,  
erythema, warmth  and tenderness  may not be possible because  of drains  in place and large surgical dressings  that cannot  be removed.  
5 The degree of the subject’s ability to ambulate  will be assessed if the osteomyelitis  is in the lower  extremity- i.e. walks  unaided, able  to bear  weight, can  walk  aid using a walker, etc. The use of upper  and 
lower extremities  will be assessed  in terms  of movement  and range of motion.  
6 Any surgical  procedures will be documented and the  findings described.  
7 CBC and chemistries . If not done for SOC, collect samples for research  if clinically indicated.  
8 CRP and  ESR will be collected  typically  as part of standard of care.   If not performed for SOC, collect samples for research if clinically indicated.  
9 Perform  test if subject  is a female who  has reached menarche.  If a pregnancy test  is positive post  baseline,  follow  reporting  requirements in Section  11.1.4.  
10 Isolate susceptib ilities will be performed on samples obtained  from  Pathology as per section 10.8.1.  
11 Refer  to section 10.9. PK samples may be collected 4 hours (+/- 30 minutes)  after any  infusion of ceftaroline  fosamil  (before the  start of  the next  infusion)  on days 2-5 and before oral switch.  
12 If purulent material  is being  obtained  from  bone  or subperiosteal abscesses  at surgery or via  drainage by interventional radiology,  we will attempt  to obtain specimens for measurement  of ceftaroline  
concentrations.  
13 Administer drug  per Section  9. 
14 Week 2 visit will occur only if the subject has been discharged prior to Week  2.

4. BACKROUND  AND  RATIONALE  
4.1. Indication  
 
Community -associated  methicillin -resistant  Staphylococcus  aureus  (CA-MRSA)  isolates  are now  an 
important  cause of systemic  infections  in children  and has to be considered  among  the pathogens for  any 
child presenting with  a bone  or joint  infection  depending on the local epidemiology.  (1) (2)  In Houston,  
TX CA-MRSA was the pathogen  in 56 of 89 (63%) children with S.aureus  osteomyelitis  seen  from  August  
2001  to July 2004.(3)  In extending these  findings,  we found over  the 10 year period from  2001  to 2010,  
195 of 376 (52%)  of S. aureus  isolates  from  children  with acute  community  acquired  osteomyelitis  were  
MRSA.   In the United  States  and in a growing  number  of countries  around the  world,  the USA300  clone  
is the most  common  or an emerging CA-MRSA pulsotype  identified  in invasive  infections,  including bone  
and joint  infections.(4,  5) 
Kingella kingae  is a relatively  common etiology  of osteoarticular infection,  primarily  septic  arthritis  in 
children under  5 years  of age.(6)  The exact  frequency  of K. kingae  bone  and joint  infections  is difficult  to 
determine  because  the organism  is somewhat  difficult  to isolate  using routine  techniques.  When  
polymerase  chain reaction  (PCR)  techniques  are applied to culture  negative  specimens from  patients  with 
presumed  septic  arthritis or acute  osteomyelitis,  K. kingae  has been  identified  in a high percentage  of 
cases  for younger  children.(7)  
Streptococcus  pneumoniae  has been a relatively  uncommon  cause  of bone  and joint  infections  but does  
occur in  children generally  less than  24 months  of age. Over  a three- year period from  September  1993 
through August  1996,  42 children with pneumococcal  bone  or joint  infections  were  identified  at 8 
children’s  hospitals. (8) In these  same  hospitals , 25 cases  were  identified  over  the three -year  period  2007 
through  2009.  In 2010  and 2011,  2 and  4 cases occurred,  respectively.(9)  Thus,  following  the introduction 
of the 13-valent  pneumococcal  conjugate  vaccine,  pneumococcal  bone  and joint  infection  is likely  to be 
even  less common in young children.  
In areas  where  CA-MRSA isolates  account  for > 10%  of community  S.aureus  isolates,  an antibiotic  effective  
against  CA-MRSA  isolates  is recommended to  be included  in the initial  empiric  antibiotic  regimen  for 
treating children with suspected  acute  hematogenous  osteomyelitis  and/or  septic  arthritis.(10)  
Vancomycin is considered the  antibiotic  of first choice  in the treatment of invasive  CA- MRSA  infections  
including musculoskeletal  infections  and is the agent to  administer  empirically  for moderately  to severely  
ill children. Nafcillin or  oxacillin is also  recommended  along  with  vancomycin for  severely  ill children 
because  these  agents  are superior  to vancomycin  for CA-MSSA  bacteremic  illness.  Clindamycin is an option  
for empiric  therapy  in patients  who are not very  ill and in whom  bacteremia is not suspect ed. Once  an 
organism  is isolated  and antibiotic  susceptibilities  known,  antibiotic  therapy  is modified.   Clindamycin is 
an effective  agent  for clindamycin susceptible  isolates.(11)  Linezolid is quite  active  against  CA-MRSA in 
vitro  and can be administered  orally  with  excellent bioavailability  for treating  CA-MRSA  osteomyelitis in 
children and is considered an option,  especially  for clindamycin  resistant  isolates.  Linezolid has  been used 
most  extensively  for this indication in children in Taiwan  where  the CA- MRSA  clone  is typically  resistant  
to clindamycin.  (12) Daptomycin has been  employed  for treatment of osteomyelitis in adults but  very  little  
has been published regarding its use for this indication in children.(13)  Trimethoprim -sulfamethoxazole  
may  be very  useful for  treating acute  osteomyelitis  caused  by Kingella kingae  or in  patients  with  culture -
negative  osteomyelitis in order  to cover K. kingae  and S.aureus .

Multiple  studies have  demonstrated  that completing  therapy  with an  oral agent  following  an initial 
duration of parenteral administration  compared  with  parenteral  therapy  alone  results in equivalent  
outcomes  for treating  musculoskeletal infections.(14,  15) In other  studies,  a high rate of complications  
was noted in children be ing treated  for acute  osteomyelitis  who  have  parenteral antibiotics  administered  
through a peripherally  placed  central catheter.(16)   Thus,  switching to oral administration                          of 
appropriate  antibiotics  to complete  treatment  of acute  osteomyelitis is an important  option for  many,  if 
not, most  patients.  The recommended  duration  of total  treatment for  acute  osteomyelitis  is at least  three  
weeks  depending on the clinical response  of the patient.  
 
4.2. Ceftaroline  Fosamil  
Ceftaroline  is a fifth generation cephalosporin with  excellent  in vitro  activity against  S. aureus  isolates  
including methicillin resistant  strains.(17)  Ceftaroline  is approved  by the United States  Food and Drug  
Administration  for treatment  of skin and soft tissue infections  caused  by MRSA in adults based  on two 
large  randomized  trials.  (18, 19)  In a rabbit  model  of MRSA  osteomyelitis, ceftaroline  and linezolid were  
significantly  better  than  vancomycin in decreasing  colony  forming units in bone  and joint  fluid.(20)  In 
seven  of ten adult  patients  with deep seated  MRSA  infections,  including osteomyelitis and septic  arthritis  
in two patients  each,  ceftaroline  treatment resulted in  a microbiologic  cure.(21)   Clinical  trials  of 
ceftaroline  in children  are being conducted  and the role of ceftaroline  in treating MRSA osteomyelitis  will 
need  to be determined.  
 
Seventeen clinical studies (3153 subjects in total) of ceftaroline fosamil have been conducted and 
completed to date. Eleven Phase 1 clinical pharmacology studies (305 subjects ) have been completed, of 
which, 10 were conducted in adults. Two Phase 2 studies (242 subjects) were conducted in adult subjects 
with complicated skin and skin structure infection (cSSSI). Four Phase 3 studies (2606 subjects) have been 
completed. Studies P903 -06 and P903 -07 were conducted in adults with cSSSI (1378 subjects) and Studies 
P903 -08 and P903- 09 were conducted in adults with CAP (1228 subjects). The Phase 3 studies were 
multicenter, randomized, double -blind, comparative, safety and efficacy stud ies of ceftaroline fosamil (600 
mg every 12 hours [q12h] as a 60 -minute IV infusion; or 400 mg q12h if the subject had renal impairment) 
versus IV comparators. Studies P903 -06 and P903 -07 in cSSSI were identical in design. The comparator was 
vancomycin plu s aztreonam (1 g of each q12h as 60 -minute IV infusions with aztreonam discontinued if a 
gram -negative pathogen [infection] was not identified or suspected). The duration of ceftaroline fosamil   
or vancomycin (with or without aztreonam) administration was  5 to 14 days (with extensions allowed up  
to 21 days with previous approval of the Medical Monitor). Studies P903 -08 and P903 -09 were similar in 
design; the only difference was that a single day of adjunctive macrolide therapy (clarithromycin) was 
adminis tered to subjects in both treatment groups in Study P903 -08 and not in Study P903 -09. The 
comparator was ceftriaxone (1 g q12h as a 30 -minute IV infusion). The duration of ceftaroline fosamil or 
ceftriaxone administration was 5 to 7 days.  
 
4.2.1.  Summary  of Toxic ology  Studies  
Ceftaroline  was well tolerated in various  animal  species  in studies  compliant  with Good  Laboratory  
Practices  (GLP).  When  given as a single  dose,  ceftaroline  fosamil had a minimum lethal dose  > 2000  mg/kg 
in rats and monkeys.  In repeat -dose  studies  (up to 13 weeks),  the no-observable -adverse -effect  level  
(NOAEL)  was 30 mg/kg/day  in rats  and 32 mg/kg/day  in monkeys.  At high doses  (270  mg/kg  in rats  and 64  
mg/kg  in monkeys),  clinical  signs  or pathological  observations  (or both)  revealed some  treatment- related

abnormalities.  The spleen  and lymphoid organs  (in 4-week  studies  only),  and kidney  were  considered the 
potential  targets  for the toxicities of ceftaroline  fosamil.  These were  typically  reversible  following  a 
recovery  period.  Clonic/tonic  convulsions  were  observed  in rodents  treated  with  high doses,  similar  to that 
observed  following  treatment with  imipenem  and other  cephalosporins.  No significant  respiratory  or 
cardiovascular  toxicities  were  observed.  
 
Reproductive  toxicity,  genotoxicity,  and juvenile  dose  range -finding studies were  also conducted  with  
ceftaroline  fosamil.  There was no evidence  of developmental  toxicity  in rats where  the NOAEL  was 300 
mg/kg/day.  In rabbits,  the NOAEL  was 100 mg/kg/day,  and doses  ≥ 50 mg/kg/day  induced a statistically  
significant  increase  in the incidence  of angulated hyoid  alae, a common  skeletal  variation in this species.  
 
Ceftaroline  fosamil was  not considered  mutagenic  and had minimal  antigenic  potential.  It did not induce  
local irritation  in rabbits and was compatible  with human plasma.  
 
A juvenile  toxicity  dose  range -finding study  was conducted with ceftaroline  fosamil in rats.  The NOAEL  was 
270 mg/kg,  which represents  a human exposure  margin of 2 for ceftaroline  (based  on area under  the plasma 
concentration versus  time  curve  [AUC]). 
 
From  a preclinical perspective,  ceftaroline  fosamil has  a comparable  safety  profile  similar to other  
cephalosporins.  The margins  of exposure  were  1 to 2 times  the maximum  recommended  human dose.  
 
4.2.2.  Summary  of Microbiological  and Pharmacology  Studies  
Ceftaroline  displays  broad  antibacterial  activity  against  aerobic  and anaerobic  gram -positive  and gram - 
negative  bacteria. Like  other  β-lactams,  ceftaroline  is bactericidal and targets  PBPs  to inhibit  bacterial  cell 
wall biosynthesis.  Ceftaroline  binds  with  high affinity  to PBPs  from  MSSA with additional  ability  to bind 
efficiently  to PBP2a,  the PBP present in MRSA responsible  for methicillin resistance.  Ceftaroline  also retains  
activity  against  contemporary  resistant  organisms  including both hospital -acquired methicillin - resistant  S. 
aureus (HA- MRSA)  and CA -MRSA,  including S.  aureus isolates  resistant  to clindamycin,  in addition to 
vancomycin -intermediate  S. aureus (VISA)  and vancomycin -resistant  S. aureus.  
 
The minimum  concentration required to  inhibit  the growth  of 90%  of organisms  (MIC90)  for S. aureus  
isolates  is typically  1 mg/L  (Study  NSR-P903 -M-071).  Ceftaroline  also has potent activity  against  isolates  of 
streptococci,  including Streptococcus  viridans  species,  with MIC90  values  typically  < 0.12  mg/L.  
Erythromycin resistance  in the streptococci  has not been  associated  with  increased  MICs  to ceftaroline.  
Against  the Enterobacteriaceae,  MIC90  values  for ceftazidime -susceptible  isolates  (ie, presumed  non-  
extended -spectrum ß -lactamase -producing,  non- AmpC  β-lactamase -overexpressing)  are typically  ≤ 1 mg/L,  
as seen  with  Citrobacter freundii,  Enterobacter  cloacae,  E. coli, K. pneumoniae, K. oxytoca,  and Proteus  
mirabilis  isolates. Ceftazidime -resistant  strains  had elevated  MIC values  to ceftaroline.  Ceftaroline  is less 
active  against  the indole -positive  Proteae,  including Morganella morganii and Providencia  spp. (MIC90  > 32 
mg/mL).  Ceftaroline  has little in vitro activity  against  Pseudomonas  aeruginosa.

Resistance  to ceftaroline  develops  at low frequency  in vitro.  For S. aureus,  spontaneous  resistant  mutants  
to 4 times  MIC of ceftaroline  have  not been observed  (≤ 10-10). In various  animal  models  of infection  caused 
by either  gram -positive  or -negative  bacteria,  including MRSA  and VISA,  ceftaroline  was shown  to be highly  
effective.  
 
In common  with  most  β-lactams,  free drug percentage  of time  above  the minimum  inhibitory  concentration 
(%T > MIC)  is the most  appropriate  parameter  to predict  efficacy  of ceftaroline.  The 
pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic  (PK/PD)  relationship for ceftaroline  was initially  evaluated  in the  
murine  neutropenic  thigh infection  model  with several  organisms  includi ng S.  aureus (Andes  and Craig,  
2006).  The mean free -drug  %T > MIC required for  stasis  was 26%  for S. aureus, regardless  of the resistance  
phenotype.  
 
The efficacy  of ceftaroline  against  aerobic  gram -positive  and gram -negative  microorganisms  has been  
established in a variety  of animal  models  of infection,  including mouse  peritonitis,  sepsis, thigh infection,  
and pneumonia;  and in rabbit  models  of endocarditis,  pneumonia,  osteomyelitis  and meningitis. In the 
mouse  pneumonia  model,  the efficacy  of ceftaroline  fosamil was  compared  with  that of  vancomycin and 
linezolid (Study  TAK- 599/00063).  The activity of ceftaroline  against  MRSA  was better  than  that of 
vancomycin and linezolid in a neutropenic  murine  pneumonia  model  in which 20  mg/kg  doses of each  drug 
were administered subcutaneously  three  times  daily  for 
2 days  beginning 1 day after  intranasal inoculation.  Ceftaroline  reduced  viable  bacterial  counts  in infected  
lungs  by 4 log units  compared  to the  untreated  control  (p < 0.01),  while  both  vancomyci n and linezolid  
failed to reduce  the bacterial counts.  When  the study  was performed  by administering the  first dose  only  
2 hours  after  inoculation,  all 3 drugs  exhibited bactericidal activity,  perhaps  because  the bacteriostatic  
agents,  vancomycin and linezolid,  were  only  effective  during the  early  stage  of infection when  the bacterial 
counts  were  low, while  ceftaroline,  being bactericidal,  was active  even  later  during the  infection.  
 
A dose -fractionation  study  (P903 -M-097)  was conducted  in a neutropenic  murine  lung infection model  
using various  clinical isolates  of S. aureus isolates  (MSSA and MRSA,  with  ceftaroline  MICs  ranging from 0.5  
to 4 mg/L)  to define  the required magnitude  of ceftaroline  exposure  (ie, free drug concentration above  the 
MIC [f T > MIC])  that reliably  results  in efficacy.  Additionally,  the efficacy  of a human simulated  regimen     of  
ceftaroline  600 mg every  12 hours  (q12h)  administered as a 1-hour  intravenous  (IV) infusion  was evaluated.  
 
Bronchopulmonary  penetration  of ceftaroline  was also assessed in the murine  pneumonia  model  by 
collecting epithelial lining fluid (ELF)  via bronchoalveolar  lavage  (BAL)  at various  time  points  after dosing in 
both infected and uninfected  animals.  Ceftaroline  concentrations  in the ELF of infected,  neutropenic  mice  
were  nearly  the same  as their  corresponding serum  concentrations.  Therefore,  f T > MIC exposures  in ELF 
were  similar  to what  was seen in the  serum  and the penetration ratio  for ceftaroline  into mouse  ELF based 
on area  under  the plasma  concentration versus  time  curve  (AUC) was approximately  100%.  The ceftaroline  
f T > MIC values  in serum  associated with  stasis  and a 1-log10  CFU reduction in bacterial  density  were  16.5%  
and 41.4%,  respectively.  The human simulated  600 mg q12h dose  regimen  provided  considerable  decreases  
in bacterial densities  for all the S. aureus  isolates  tested, which  had ceftaroline  MICs  of 0.5 to 4 
IND 124109   Grant ID: TEF -IT-43/IIT -2017 -10048

mg/L.  In a rabbit  model  of pneumonia,  dose  administration  was by a computer -controlled  infusion pump  
to accurately  simulate  human PK for ceftaroline  and comparator ceftriaxone  (Croisier -Bertin  et al,  2011).  
Three  pneumococcal  isolates  with  varying susceptibility  to penicillin were  evaluated,  including penicillin - 
susceptible  S. pneumoniae  (PSSP),  penicillin -intermediate  S. pneumoniae  (PISP),  and penicillin -resistant S.  
pneumoniae  (PRSP).  Human simulated  dosing (600  mg every  q12h for  ceftaroline,  1 g every  24 hours  [q24h] 
for ceftriaxone)  was administered for  2 days  beginning  5 hours  after  endobronchial  challenge  with  5 × 109 
colony  forming units  (CFU).  Ceftaroline  and ceftriaxone  were  similarly  effective  in reducing  bacterial burden  
in the lungs  (approximately  7 log CFU/g,  to essentially  undetectable  levels)  for the PSSP  and PISP  infections , 
but only  ceftaroline  was bactericidal against  the PRSP  isolate.  A second study  evaluated  efficacy  against  a 
PVL-producing isolate  of USA300 MRSA  in the  same  rabbit  pneumonia  model  with simulated human dosing  
for ceftaroline,  vancomycin,  linezolid,  and clindamycin (Croisier -Bertin et al, 2011).  High  mortality  observed  
in untreated  control  animals  was completely  prevented by  ceftaroline  and also greatly  reduced  by linezolid 
and clindamycin,  while  animals  treated  with  vancomycin  showed  only  marginal improvement  in survival. 
Bacterial  counts  in lung  were lowest  in the  ceftaroline -treated  animals  (approximately  5-log reduction 
compared to control),  although not statistically  different  from  the animals  receiving linezolid,  lindamycin,  
or vancomycin.  PVL toxin levels  were  monitored and treatment with  clindamycin,  ceftaroline,  and linezolid 
were  found to result  in greatly  reduced  levels  of toxin compared  to vancomycin,  which  may  partially  explain  
the enhanced tissue  damage  observed  in lungs  of vancomycin - treated  animals.  
 
The plasma  protein binding of ceftaroline  in vitro was generally  low (mean  ± SD of 20%  ± 6.1%)  and 
concentration independent  in human plasma  over the clinically  relevant  concentration range.  In vitro  
oxidative  metabolic  studies  with  liver  microsomes  demonstrated  that the metabolism of ceftaroline  is not 
dependent upon cytochrome  P450  enzymes  (CYP).  In vitro  studies in human liver  microsomes  indicated  
that neither  ceftaroline  fosamil nor  ceftaroline  inhibits  the major  CYP isoenzymes.  In addition,  studies in 
human hepatocytes  also demonstrated that  ceftaroline  fosamil,  ceftaroline,  and ceftaroline  M-1 are not 
inducers  of CYP activity.  Therefore,  ceftaroline  is not expected  to inhibit  or induce  the clearance  of drugs  
that are  metabolized  by these metabolic  pathways  in a clinically  relevant  manner.  
 
No differences  in the pharmacokinetics  of ceftaroline  fosamil,  ceftaroline,  or ceftaroline  M-1 were  noted 
between  genders  in rats  and monkeys.  In addition,  there  was no accumulation  of ceftaroline  fosamil or 
ceftaroline  after repeated  once -daily  administration,  and only  moderate  accumulation  of ceftaroline  M-1 
was observed  in the repeat -dose  toxicology  studies.  
 
Safety  pharmacology  studies were  performed  in various  experimental  animal  models and in vitro testing  
systems to examine  the effects  of ceftaroline  fosamil  on behavioral  and physiological effects,  respiratory  
function,  and the cardiovascular system.  
 
4.2.3.  Completed Pediatric  Stud ies 
One of the 11 Phase  1 clinical  pharmacology  studies,  Study  P903- 15 “Pharmacokinetics  of a Single  Dose  of 
Ceftaroline  in Subjects  12 to 17 Years  of Age Receiving Antibiotic  Therapy,” was conducted in adolescents.  
IND 124109   Grant ID: TEF -IT-43/IIT -2017 -10048

Study  P903- 15 was a  Phase  1, multicenter,  open -label,  noncomparative,  single -dose  study  of ceftaroline  
fosamil in subjects  12 to 17 years  of age, inclusive,  who  were  hospitalized  and receiving antibiotic  therapy  
for treatment  of infections  of any  type.  Subjects  received  a single  IV infusion  of ceftaroline  fosamil at  a dose  
of 8 mg/kg  if weighing < 75 kg (165.4  lb) or 600 mg if weighing 75  kg (165.4  lb) or more.  The primary  objective  
was to evaluate  the single -dose  pharmacokinetics  of ceftaroline,  the prodrug ceftaroline  fosamil,  and the  
inactive  M-1 metabolite.  The secondary  objective was to evaluate  the safety of ceftaroline  in adolescent 
subjects.  
 
Nine  subjects,  5 male  and 4 female  subjects  with a  mean age of  13.7  years  (range  12 to 16 years),  were  
enrolled  in the study.  One subject  was prematurely  discontinued  from  study  drug due to infusion site  
extravasation that  was moderate  in severity  and assessed  by the Investigator  as unrelated to  ceftaroline.  
This subject  received  approximately  80%  of the planned dose.  
 
The remaining 8 subjects  each receive d a complete  dose  of ceftaroline  fosamil.  All subjects  completed the 
study  and were  included  in the Safety Population.  Eight  treatment -emergent adverse  events  (TEAEs)  
occurred  in 5 subjects.  All TEAEs  were  mild  or moderate  in severity.  Three TEAEs  (extrasystoles, vomiting,  
and “electrocardiogram  [ECG]  prolonged  QT interval”)  were  considered  related  to ceftaroline  by the 
Investigator  and each  occurred in a different  subject.  All TEAEs resolved  except  for “ECG prolonged  QT 
interval”  in 1 subject  that was detected  on Study  Day 2 and was not assessed  further.  (The  subject’s  QTcB  
and QTcF  values  were  < 450 msec  and similar between  the predose  and postdose  measurements.)  One 
subject  mentioned  above  prematurely  discontinued  study  drug,  but no subjects  prematurely  withdrew  
from  the study  or died. One subject  with  osteomyelitis  had a serious  adverse  event  (SAE)  of a pathologic  
fracture  of the humerus that  occurred  13 days  after  infusion of ceftaroline  fosamil.  The fracture  was mild  
in severity  and conside red by the Investigator  as unrelated to  ceftaroline.  
 
No clinical  chemistry or urinalysis  values  met potentially  clinically  significant  (PCS)  criteria.  One hematology  
value  met PCS criteria,  one subject  who  had received several blood replacement products  for blood  loss 
secondary  to trauma  and surgery  had a high activated partial  thromboplastin  time.  One subject  met PCS 
criteria for  a vital sign value,  a low diastolic  blood pressure. Neither PCS value  was associated  with a  TEAE. 
No ECG parameter  values  met PCS criteria.  Most  abnormal  laboratory,  vital  sign,  and ECG findings  were  
consistent  with  the subjects’  medical  conditions.  
These results  show  that a single  dose  of ceftaroline  fosamil (8  mg/kg  up to  a maximum  dose  of 600 mg, IV) 
was generally  well tolerated by  9 adolescent  subjects  who  were  hospitalized  and receiving antibiotic  
therapy  for an infection  of any type.  The mean  values  of maximum  plasma drug concentration  (Cmax)  and 
AUC  for ceftaroline  observed  in adolescent  subjects  (12 to 17 years)  who  received  ceftaroline  fosamil at a 
dose  of 8 mg/kg  (600 mg for subjects  weighing > 75 kg) were  approximately  10%  and 23%,  respectively,  less 
than  the values  observed  in adult  subjects  following administration  of a 600-mg dose  of ceftaroline  fosamil.  
 
Study  P903 -21 “Pharmacokinetics  of a Single  Dose  of Ceftaroline  fosamil in Children  Ages  Birth  to Younger  
than 12 Years  With  Suspected or Confirmed  Infection”  was a Phase  1, multicenter,  open -label,

sequential,  single -dose,  prospective  study  of ceftaroline  fosamil.  Subjects  were enrolled  in 5  sequential 
cohorts  of descending  age;  enrollment  of sequential cohorts  could overlap,  depending on results  from  
intermittent  PK analyses.  Subjects  who  were hospitalized  and receiving antibiotic  therapy  for treatment  of 
suspected  or confirmed  infections  were enrolled  and each  receive d a single  dose  of IV ceftaroline  fosamil.  
 
Data from  Study  P903 -21, Study  P903 -15, and other  data  were used to determine  the ceftaroline  fosamil 
dose  in this study.  
 
4.2.4.  Summary  of Studies  in Adults  
In single - and multiple -dose  Phase  1 studies  in adults,  the Cmax  and AUC  of ceftaroline  increased  
approximately  in proportion to increases  in dose  within the  dose  range  of 50 to 1000  mg, and no 
accumulation  of ceftaroline  fosamil or active  ceftaroline  was observed  with  either  q12h or every  24-hour  
multiple  dose  regimens. Ceftaroline  Cmax  was generally  reached  near  the end of the IV infusion,  and the 
terminal  elimination  half-life (T½)  of ceftaroline  was typically  in the range of 2.0 to 2.6 hours. Following  IV 
infusion of [14C]  ceftaroline  fosamil,  87.5%  of the dose  of radioactivity was excreted in urine  and 6.0%  was 
excreted in feces,  confirming that  urinary  excretion is the principal  route  of elimination.  A significant  
percentage  of the ceftaroline  fosamil dose  was excreted  in the urine  as ceftaroline  (approximately  40%  to 
70%).  No dosage  adjustment  is considered necessary  for subjects with mild renal  impairment.  Dosage  
adjustment  is recommended in subjects with  moderate  and severe  renal  impairment (creatinine  clearance  
[CrCl]  ≤ 50 mL/min).  
 
Study  CEF-PK-02 was a recently  completed  Phase  1, open -label,  multiple -dose  study  in healthy  adult  subjects  
to assess the concentration of ceftaroline  in ELF. Subjects  were  randomized  to receive  one of the following  
dosing regimens:  Treatment  A - 600 mg ceftaroline  fosamil q12h for  3 days  with  a single  dose  on Day 4; 
Treatment  B - 600 mg ceftaroline  fosamil  every  8 hours  (q8h)  for 3 days  with a single  dose  on Day 4. Twenty -
five subjects received  each  dosing regimen.  Plasma samples  for PK analysis  were  collected  predose  and 
over  24 hours  after the final  dose  on Day 4. Subjects  underwent  bronchoscopy  and BAL at a single  time  point  
after  the last dose  in order  to collect  ELF. Preliminary  data  indicate  that the ratio of AUCs  of free ceftaroline  
in ELF to free ceftaroline  in plasma,  assuming 20%  protein binding in plasma  and no protein binding in ELF, 
was approximately  22%.  All subjects had measurable  ceftaroline  concentrations  in ELF at 1, 2, 4, and  6 hours  
after  the start of the ceftaroline  fosamil infusion.  Eight  out of 10 subjects  that underwent BAL  8 hours  after 
dosing had  measurable  ceftaroline  concentration  in ELF, and none  of the 5 subjects  that underwent BAL  at 
12 hours  after dosing had measurable  ceftaroline  in ELF. These  data  demonstrate  that ceftaroline  is able  to 
penetrate  into ELF and concentrations  of ceftaroline  in ELF appreciably  exceeded the  MIC90  for ceftaroline  
against  S. aureus  (1 mg/L)  at 1 and 2 hours  after  the start  of the ceftaroline  fosamil infusion in all  subjects.  
Plasma and ELF concentrations  were  similar  for the 2 dosing regimens,  with the q8h regimen  showing  slightly  
(approximately  15%  to 20%)  higher  concentrations  on average.  Ceftaroline  appeared to  be eliminated from  
plasma and ELF at  a similar  rate.  
 
Ceftaroline  fosamil at a dose  of 600 mg (or 400 mg if the subject  had renal  impairment)  q12h was well 
tolerated in 693 adult  subjects in the 2 completed  Phase  3 CAP studies. As shown  in these  studies,  
IND 124109   Grant ID: TEF -IT-43/IIT -2017 -10048 
 
v5.0 ( 08Oct 2018 )  Page 19 of 49 
  
monotherapy  with ceftaroline  fosamil at  a dose  of 600 mg administered  as a 1-hour  IV infusion q12h for  5 
to 7 days  is effective  for the treatment of CABP  caused by  susceptible  isolates  of the following  gram - positive  
and gram -negat ive microorganisms:  S. pneumoniae (including cases  with  concurrent  bacteremia),  MSSA,  
H. influenzae,  K. pneumoniae,  K. oxytoca,  and E. coli. 
 
Therapy  with ceftaroline  fosamil was shown to be noninferior  to ceftriaxone  (with or without  
clarithromycin)  in the clinical cure  rate at TOC in the 2 coprimary  populations  (Modified  Intent -to-Treat  
Efficacy  and Clinically  Evaluable  [CE]). Noninferiority  was also demonstrated in the clinical response  at 
End-of-Therapy  (EOT)  in the 2 coprimary  populations.  Finally,  efficacy  results  consistently  demonstrated  
similar  cure  rates  between  ceftaroline  and ceftriaxone  in important  subgroups  and key secondary  
analyses.  Clinical  response  rates at Study  Day 4 in these  two studies  were  69.6%  and 69.0%  for ceftaroline  
versus  58.3%  and 61.4%  for ceftriaxone.  
 
4.3. Rationale for  Present  Study  
 
Ceftaroline  has excellent in vitro  activity  against  S.aureus  including MRSA,  Group  A streptococcus,  
Streptococuccus  pneumoniae  and Kingella kingae  which  are the most  common causes of acute  
hematogenous  osteomyelitis  in children.  Ceftaroline is now approved by the FDA for treating children with 
community -acccquired pneumonia and skin and soft tissue infections, conditions which are generally 
caused by the same bacteria that cause hematogenous  osteomyelitis. Currently  CA-MRSA is a major 
problem  throughout  the United  States  and the use of vancomycin  or clindamycin has  increased dramatically  
in children as a result.  
 
Dosing  of vancomycin is problematic  and vancomycin  has common  side effects  such  as red  man  syndrome  
and renal  dysfunction.  Clindamycin is not recommended  if there  are concerns  for concomitant  
bacteremia because it is a bacteristatic  agent.  Daptomycin  may  be useful but is just being studied in 
pediatric  patients  for osteomyelitis  and should not  be used  if there  is evidence  of concomitant  pneumonia.  
Thus,  the addition  of another  parenteral  antibiotic  for treatment of acute  hematogenous  osteomyelitis 
in children is desirable.  
 
There is no safety data available  for administering ceftaroline  to adults  every  8 hours.   The  safety  data 
for administering ceftaroline  every  8 hours  to children  has been determined in three pediatric trials.

Efficacy o f Ceftaroline Versus Comparator in Pediatric Patients with Acute Bacterial Skin and Skin 
Structure Infe ction. Pediatr Infect Dis J 20 ; 35:e239- 47. The most common adverse events for patients 
receiving ceftaroline were diarrhea and vomiting.  Eosinophilia d eveloped in about 5% of patients. The 
proportions of patients developing adverse events were similar for the

v5.0 ( 08Oct 2018 )  Page 20 of 49 
 ceftaroline and comparator groups in each of these studies.   We are using the  same  dose  and interval 
for ceftaroline  that was used  for the pediat ric trial of ceftaroline  for complicated  pneumonia  (clinical 
trials  identifier  number  [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]).  
 
4.4. Rationale for  Ceftaroline Fosamil  Dosage Regimen  
 
The selected ceftaroline dose regimens (15 mg/kg [600 mg if > 40 kg] as a 2-hour infusion q8h) are  
expected  to achieve PK/PD targets associated with  1-log kill of S. aureus in the  murine pneumonia model 
for organisms with  MIC values up to  1 mg/L in >  90% of  patients 2 months to <  18 years.  The median 
Cmax value in children 1 year  to < 18 years with nor mal renal function dosed  with 15 mg/kg q8h as a  2-
hour infusion predicted to be less  than the median Cmax value in adults dosed with  600 mg q8h as a 1-
hour infusion. The median AUC0 -24h in children 1 year to <  18 years dosed  with the above regimen is 
predicted to be up to  15% greater than in adults dosed  with  600 mg q8h.  The median f T > MIC for an 
MIC of 1 mg/L is predicted to be 84 -93% for the  recommended pediatric dose regimens compared to 
100% in adults dosed  with 600 mg q8h.  
 
Initially,  the sponsor  believed  that a  dose of15 mg/kg q8h to match the  dose of 600 mg q8h in adults  
was appropriate  for children from 6  months to <18 years. However,  based  on findings  in the pediatric  
ABSSSI and CABP  studies, a lower dose of 10 mg/kg  q8h is more appropriate  for children from 6 months  
to          < 2 years in order  to avoid higher AUC  values. The 10 mg/kg  q8h dose in  this age range  is expected 
to result  in a median fT  (unbound drug time  over MIC)>MIC of 78-88% for an MIC of 1 mg/L and 58-66% 
for an MIC of 2 mg/L.  This would give  nearly 100% target attainment for  a target of 50% at  an MIC of 1 
mg/L. The higher  dose of 15 mg/kg  q8h would still be appropriate  for children 2 and older.  
 
4.5. Outpatient  Parenteral  Antimicrobial  Therapy  
 
If a subject  is going to require  continued  parenteral therapy  with an antibiotic  to complete therapy  at home,  
they will be dropped from  the study  protocol  because  of the difficulty  in providing parenteral antibiotics  in 
a study  using  a home  health company.  Patient  will continue  therapy  with  another  agent  at home.  The 
subjects  will be followed and assessed for  outcome  at the time  of discharge  as well as for  safety 
assessments  at the completion of ceftaroline  administration.  The home  therapy  will be determined  as 
clinically  indicated for  such  subjects.  
 
4.6. Oral  Drugs  
 
A switch  to one of the following  open- label  PO drugs  (as per accepted  clinical care  processes)  is expected  / 
allowed  on or after EOIV  assessments are completed  and if criteria  in Section  9.2 are met:  
• PO clindamycin 13  mg/kg/dose  q8h in subjects  with proven  MRSA infection due  to clindamycin  
susceptible  MRSA  or if no  pathogen  has been isolated.  
OR 
 
• PO cephalexin  25 to 33 mg/kg/dose  q 8 hours  in subjects with  proven  MSSA  infection.  
 
OR 
• PO linezolid 600  mg q12h (Children  > 12 years  old) or 10 mg/kg  q8h (children < 12 years  old) in 
IND 124109   Grant ID: TEF -IT-43/IIT -2017 -10048 
 
v5.0 ( 08Oct 2018 )  Page 21 of 49 
 subjects with clindamycin -resistant  MRSA pathogens  or for subjects  with  MRSA  isolates  who  are 
unable  to tolerate  clindamycin.  
 
5. STUDY  OBJECTIVES  
5.1. Primary Objectives  
 
• Evaluate  the safety  of ceftaroline  in pediatric  subjects  1 to 17 years  of age (inclusive)  with acute  
hematogenous  osteomyelitis  at the end of intravenous  therapy.  
 
5.2. Secondary  Objectives  
 
• Evaluate  efficacy  of ceftaroline  in pediatric  subjects  with  acute  hematogenous  osteomyelitis at the 
end of IV therapy,  at the end of total  therapy  (anticipated to  be at 4 to 6 weeks  after enrollment),  
and at one year after  enrollment.  
• Evaluate  clearance  of S. aureus  bacteremia  if blood cultures  initially  positive.  
• Assess  proportion  of patients  with  plasma  levels  of ceftaroline  that exceed  1 µg/mL  for over  60%  of 
a dosing interval.  
 
6. STUDY  DESIGN  
 
This is a Phase  1/2, open -label,  single -center  study  to determine  safety  and tolerability  of ceftaroline  in 
pediatric  subjects  1 to 17 years  of age  (inclusive)  with  signs  and symptoms  of acute  hematogenous  
osteomyelitis at the end of intravenous  therapy.  After informed  consent/assent is obtained,  ceftaroline  
will be administered  intravenously.  After  the subject  has been  afebrile  for at least  48 hours,  has negative  
blood  cultures,  is clearly  improving in general, is able  to eat and drink,  and is able  to use or move  the 
involved  extremity,  the subject  may  be switched  to oral  antibiotic  administration  as outlined  in section  
5.4.2.  The expenses  will be covered by the study.  
 
6.1. Outcome  Measures  
Primary:  Safety  evaluations  will be conducted in the children who  have started treatment with 
ceftaroline . Assessments  will include:  
 
• AEs,  SAEs,  deaths,  and discontinuations  due to SAEs. 
 
• Vital  signs  and laboratory  parameters.  
 
Secondary:  
• Clinical  response  (the subject  has been  afebrile  for at least  48 hours,  has negative  blood  cultures,  is 
clearly improving in general,  is able  to eat and drink,  and is able  to use or move  the involved  
extremity)  at the end of parenteral therapy  (approximately  days 5 to 14) by subject  and by baseline  
pathogens although  S.aureus  is expected  to be the predominant  pathogen.  
 
• Clinical  outcome  (site of infection has  complete  resolution  of pain,  swelling  and warmth  and the 
patient  is able  to use the affected  extremity  normally  and is back  to normal  activities)  at the EOT and 
at the one year  follow  up visit.  
IND 124109   Grant ID: TEF -IT-43/IIT -2017 -10048 
 
v5.0 ( 08Oct 2018 )  Page 22 of 49 
 • Clinical  relapse  within  a year  of enrollment  in the  study  or the development  of a pathologic  fracture.  
PK: 
• Concentrations  of ceftaroline  fosamil,  ceftaroline,  and ceftaroline  M-1 in plasma.  
 
• If available,  concentrations  of ceftaroline  fosamil,  ceftaroline,  and ceftaroline  M-1 in purulent  material 
such as bone  or subperiosteal  abscess  or synovial fluid.  
 
6.2. Number  of Subjects  
 
18 Children 1 to 17 years of age, inclusive. Each subject will receive ceftaroline.  2 subjects above 5 years 
old will be enrolled before the younger subjects are enrolled.  
 
Based on A ’Hern’ s single -stage design for Phase II clinical trials 18 subjects would be required to reject 
H_0:π≤0.50  and conclude H_1:π≥0.80  with 80% power assuming a Type 1 error rate of 0.05.   
 
6.3. Expected  Duration of  Subject  Participation 
 
The duration of subject  participation from  signing the  informed  consent  form will be up to 14 months  
(includes  screening period (1 Day),  study IV  drug administration  (approximately 5 -14 Days),  Standard  of 
Care  Oral Drug Administration (4 -5 weeks) ( the total maximum  treatment  period  is typically  6 weeks ), 
and a follow -up visit 12 months  after  the last dose  of study  drug).   Baseline  assessments  for study  eligibility  
will occur within 24 hours  before  the first dose  of study  drug.  A minimum  of 2 days  (48 hours)  of study 
drug administration  is required.  
 
6.4. Data Review Committee  
 
A Data  and Safety  Review  Committee  (DRC)  will be established  to review  safety  data  on a regular basis  to 
ensure  safety  of all subjects  enrolled.   
A DRC  meeting  is to be  held at regular intervals  to evaluate  the safety  of this study  and other  ongoing  
pediatric  studies  of ceftaroline  fosamil.  The role of the DRC members  is to evaluate  the safety  of the pediatric  
studies  on an ongoing  basis  in order  to determine  whether  any undue  safety  concerns  are observed,  and 
thus  whether  the studies  should be allowed  to continue  enrollment.  
 
A detailed  DRC charter  will be prepared  by the Investigator  and agreed  to by  all DRC members  before  
initiation  of enrollment  in this study.  This charter  will document  the timing,  membership,  analysis  content,  
and review  procedures  for each  DRC meeting.  Safety  information  will be prepared  in advance  of each  DRC 
meeting.  Safety  analyses  will include,  at a minimum,  summaries  of study  disposition  and all SAEs,  deaths,  
and discontinuations  due to AEs, PCS laboratory  results,  and individual  subject  listings  of selected  safety  
data.

7.7. Subject  Discontinuation or  Withdrawal  
 
Subjects  should  be encouraged  to complete  all study  outcome  assessments.  However,  a subject  may  be 
discontinued from  study  drug  or may  withdraw  assent/consent  to participate  in this study  at any time  
without  penalty  or loss of benefits  to which  the subject  is otherwise  entitled.  Subjects  will be assessed  for 
safety of ceftaroline  at the time  points  outlined  in the schedule  of evaluations , if possible . 
 
7.7.1.  Off Study  Criteria:  
• Subjects  who  require  continued  home  parenteral antibiotics  will be discontinued  from  the study.  
• Subjects  that require  IV treatment after  switching to Oral  drug.  
• If a subject’s  estimated CrCl decreases  to < 50 mL/min  during the  treatment  period,  the subject  will be 
discontinued  from  the study.  
• Diarrhea  (the occurrence  of > 4 loose  stools  /day)  with blood  or mucus  
• Moderate  to severe maculopapular rash  that does  not resolve  following  administration  of 
diphenhydramine  (Benadryl®)  or any  urticarial rash.  
• Absolute  neutrophil count  < 500 WBC/mm3 (Grade  4) 
• Hemolytic  anemia  Grade  2 (evidence  of > 2 g decrease  in hemoglobin  but does  not require  blood  
transfusion)  or above.  
• Thrombocytopenia -Platelet  count  < 100,000/mm3 (Grade  1) 
• AST/ALT  > 3 X ULN (grade  3) 
 
7.8. Premature Discontinuation From  Study  Drug  Administration 
7.8.1.  Discontinuations  Due to Safety  
 
Assessments  and Procedures: A subject  who is  prematurely  discontinued from  study  drug administration  (ie, 
before  the anticipated  full course  of study  drug required for effective  treatment  of hematogenous  SA 
osteomyelitis  for safety  reasons)  should have  EOIV  or EOT (if on PO drug)  assessments  conducted  per Section 
9, and undergo  subsequent  assessments  at FU, if possible . The same  procedures  will be followed  if the  
subject  needs to  continue  home  IV therapy  to complete  treatment  because  the subject  is intolerant  of an  
appropriate  oral antibiotic  or there is no oral agent that  is active  against  the organism  isolated.  
 
Clinical  Outcome  Assessment:  
 
If a subject  prematurely  discontinues  the study  drug due to an  SAE and requires  alternative  non- study  
antimicrobials  for hematogenous  SA osteomyelitis,  the subject  should  be assessed indeterminate . 
 
Reasons:  Reason(s)  for premature  discontinuation  from  study  drug administration  due to safety  may 
include,  but are not limited  to, the following:  
IND 124109   Grant ID: TEF -IT-43/IIT -2017 -10048 
 
v5.0 ( 08Oct 2018 )  Page 25 of 49 
  
• Occurrence  of an  SAE that,  in the opinion  of the Investigator,  warrants  the subject’s  permanent  
discontinuation  from  the study  drug or oral drug  administration.  
 
• Known pregnancy  or breastfeeding  during  the drug administration  period.  A female  subject  whose  
pregnancy  test is positive  at the end of total  treatment must  be followed  through  the immediate  
postnatal  period  or until  termination  of the pregnancy.  Every  pregnancy  will be reported  as soon as 
possible  (within  24 hours  of learning  of the pregnancy),  as described  in Section  11.1.4.  
 
7.8.2.  Discontinuations  Due to Insufficient  Therapeutic Effect  
 
Assessments  and Procedures:  A subject  who is  prematurely  discontinued  from  study  drug administration  
due to insufficient  therapeutic  effect  should  have  EOIV  (if on IV study  drug)  or EOT (if on PO drug)  assessments 
conducted  per Section  9, and undergo  subsequent  safety  assessments  at the 4 to 6 week  follow  up visit.  If a 
subject  is discontinued  from  IV study  drug administration  due to insufficient  therapeutic effect  and is 
switched  to an alternative  IV antibiotic,  the alternative  therapy  should be recorded.  
 
Clinical  Outcome  Assessment: A subject  who  is prematurely  discontinued  from  study  drug administration  
due to insufficient  therapeutic  effect  should be assessed as a clinical failure  on the day of discontinuation.  
Such a subject  will be automatically  assigned  an outcome  of clinical  failure  at all subsequent  evaluation  time  
points.  
Reasons:  Reason(s)  for discontinuation  from  study  drug  administration  due to insufficient  therapeutic  
effect  may  include,  but are not limited  to, the following:  
 
• Clinical Worsening:  A subject  who  shows  signs  of clinical  worsening  may  be prematurely  discontinued  
from  study  drug administration  at any time.  If the Investigator  deems  the benefit -to-risk ratio  of 
continuing  study  drug acceptable,  study  drug administration  for at least  48 hours  is encouraged  before  
discontinuation.    If the subject  is improving  clinically  but the blood cultures  are persistently  positive  for 
S. aureus  for up to 5 days,  ceftaroline  can be  continued at the  discretion  of the investigator.  
 
• Lack  of Clinical  Progress : For  a subject  who is stable,  yet does  not show  signs  of improvement,  the 
Investigator  is encouraged  to continue  study  drug administration  at least  48 hours  before  such a 
subject  is assessed  as a clinical  failure  and the subject  is prematurely  discontinued  from  study  drug.  
 
7.8.3.  Withdrawal  
 
Assessments and Procedures:  A subject  may  withdraw  from  the study,  or be withdrawn at the request  of 
their parent(s)  or legally  acceptable  representative(s),  the Investigator,  or Sponsor. A subject  who is  
withdrawn completely  from  this study  during study  treatment should  be encouraged  to undergo,  if possible,  
EOIV  (if on IV study  drug)  or EOT (if not on IV study  drug)  assessments per Section  10, respectively,  on the 
day of withdrawal.  
Clinical  Outcome  Assessment:  A subject  withdrawn from  the study  who  is not assessed as  a clinical  failure  
should  be assessed  as indeterminate  at all subsequent  outcome  evaluation time  points.  
 
Reasons: Reason(s)  for withdrawal from the study  may  include,  but are not limited  to, the following:  
 
• Withdrawal of assent  or consent  
• Lost to follow  up 
• Significant  subject  noncompliance,  defined  as refusal or inability  to adhere  to the prescribed  dosing  or

v5.0 ( 08Oct 2018 )  Page 26 of 49 
 follow -up regimen 
• Investigator  determination  that it is  in the  best  interest  of the subject to withdraw  from  the study,  due 
to reasons  other  than  an SAE. 
 
7.9. Replacement  of Subjects  
 
Subjects  who  are withdrawn  from  study  before  receiving  any amount  of study  drug will be replaced  in order  
to enroll  a total  of 18 treated  subjects  for safety  evaluations.  Subject  numbers  will not be reused.  
 
7.10. Stopping  Rules  
 
The incidence  or severity  of AEs indicates  a potential  health  hazard  to subjects.  The study  will be stopped 
if treatment failures  occur  in two patients  or severe  adverse  events  that are due to ceftaroline  in the opinion  
of the PI occur in two patients.  
 
8. STUDY  DRUGS  
8.1. Ceftaroline Fosamil Intravenous Study Drug  
 
 
Ceftaroline  fosamil for injection,  400 or 600 mg  per vial, is supplied  as a sterile  pale  yellowish -white  to light  
yellow  crystalline  powder  in a single -dose,  clear  glass  20-mL vial. The excipient  L-arginine  is added  as an  
alkalizing  agent  to maintain  the pH of the constituted  solution  between  4.8 and 6.5. 
 
Ceftaroline  fosamil is approved  in the United  States  for use in adults  with  ABSSSI or  CABP.  Ceftaroline  fosamil 
is limited  in pediatric  subjects  to investigational use only. Refer to the current  ceftaroline  fosamil IB 
(Ceftaroline  fosamil,  2011)  for additional information.  
 
Dosing Information:  IV ceftaroline  fosamil  15 mg/kg  (or 600 mg if > 40 kg)  infused  over  120 (± 10) minutes  
q8h (± 1 hour)  for children  2 years  of age – 17 years of age  (inclusive).  
 
IV ceftaroline  fosamil 10 mg/kg  infused  over  120 (± 10) minutes  q 8h (±  1 hour)  for children from  1 year  of 
age to < 2 years  (inclusive).  
 
8.2. Directions  for Use 
 
Vials  of ceftaroline  fosamil are constituted  with  20.0  mL of Sterile  Water  for Injection;  the amount  of solution 
containing  the appropriate  dose  is further diluted  in sterile  normal  saline  before  infusion.  
 
8.3. Storage  
 
Vials  containing  unconstituted  ceftaroline  fosamil  are stored  according  to labeled  requirements.  
 
8.4. Criteria for Switching to Oral  Drug  
 
A switch  to PO drug (see  Section  9.2.2)  is allowed  on or after  EOIV  assessments  are completed  and if all of 
the following  criteria are met:  
 
• Received  at least  48 hours  of IV study  drug.  
 
IND 124109   Grant ID: TEF -IT-43/IIT -2017 -10048 
 
v5.0 ( 08Oct 2018 )  Page 27 of 49 
 • Clinical  signs  and symptoms  have  been  assessed.  
 
• Ability  to maintain  oral intake.  
 
• Afebrile  (temperature  ≤ 38.0°C)  for at least  48 hours.  
 
• Blood cultures  are negative  for 48 hours.  
 
• CRP decreased compared with baseline value.  
 
• Absence  of new  or improvement  in at least  1 of the following  signs  and symptoms and worsening of 
none:  
 
o Extremity  movement  or pain.  
 
o Able  to ambulate  either  unaided  or with  a walker  or crutches.  
 
Subjects  that require  IV treatment after  switching to Oral  drug will  be discontinued  from the study.  
 
8.4.1.  Oral  Drug  Options  
 
The appropriate  PO drug may  depend  on the pathogen,  the options  include  the following:  
 
• Preferred  oral switch  for subjects  with  infections  due to methicillin -susceptible  S. aureus , Group A 
streptococcus  or K. kingae -cephalexin  75-100 mg/kg/day  in three  divided doses.  
 
• Alternative  PO option  for subjects  with  proven  MRSA  infections  due to clindamycin -susceptible  is 
clindamycin  13 mg/kg/dose  q8h.  Clindamycin  is also the oral agent  typically  selected  to complete  
treatment  when  no organism  is isolated.  
 
• Linezolid is an option for  completing  therapy  for a clindamycin  resistant  MRSA  isolate  or for patients  
who  cannot  tolerate  clindamycin.  Linezolid dosing is  10 mg/kg/dose  q 8 hours  for children  < 12 year  
old and 600 mg q 12 hours  for children  > 12 years  old. 
 
Dosing  adjustments  are discussed in Section 9.3. Consult  the package  inserts,  labels, and local dosing 
guidelines  regarding  preparation,  storage,  administration,  maximum  doses,  contraindications,  warnings,  
precautions,  and AEs reported  with  the use of the PO study  drugs.  
 
8.5. Dose Adjustments  
 
Subjects  with  moderately  (CrCl  30 mL/min  to ≤ 50 mL/min)  or severely  (CrCl  < 30 mL/min)  impaired  renal 
function (calculated  using  the appropriate  updated Schwartz “bedside”  formula;  Schwartz  et al, 2009) will 
not be enrolled  in this study;  thus  no ceftaroline  fosamil dose  adjustments  are expected  to be required  for 
renal  impairment.  However,  if the subject’s  estimated  CrCl decreases  to < 50 mL/min  during  the treatment 
period,  the patient  will be discontinued  from  the study.  
 
8.6. Adjunctive  Surgical  Procedures  
 
Details  of adjunctive  surgical  procedure(s) related  to hematogenous  SA osteomyelitis  that are performed  
for any subject  in this study  will be collected and documented.  
IND 124109   Grant ID: TEF -IT-43/IIT -2017 -10048 
 
v5.0 ( 08Oct 2018 )  Page 28 of 49 
  
8.7. Treatment  Compliance  
 
Treatment compliance  will be documented  in the eCRF  by recording  the date,  time,  and whether  or not 
each  IV dose  study  drug was  completely  infused  and,  if applicable,  whether  or not each  intended  dose  of 
PO drug  was taken.  
 
8.8. Accountability  Procedures  
 
It is the responsibility  of the Pharmacist  or designee  to ensure  that current  records  of study  drug inventory  
and accountability  are maintained.  Records  must  be readily  available  for inspection.  
 
Upon  receipt  of study  therapy drugs,  the Pharmacist  or designee  will acknowledge  receipt,  visually  inspect  
the shipment,  verify  the number of vials shipped  are received, and document  the condition  of the drugs  
received.  
 
All study  drugs  provided  by Allergan  should be  retained  at the site  until  otherwise  instructed in writing by  
Allegan . Upon completion  of the study  all used (vials),  unused,  and partially  used  IV study  drugs  will be 
shipped  to a site designated  by Allergan . Refer  to the Pharmacy  instructions  or package  insert  for additional  
information.  
 
9. STUDY  ASSESSMENTS  AND PROCEDURES  
 
The Schedule  of Assessments and Procedures  is located  in Table  2.1. Unless otherwise noted,  the 
assessments and procedures  should be conducted  in person  by the Investigator or designee.  
 
Any protocol -required  evaluations  (eg, laboratory  tests and) already  done  locally  on the corresponding  
study  day, including  baseline,  as part of the subject’s regular  medical  care  can be recorded  on the eCRFs  
and do not have  to be  repeated  for purposes of this study.  
 
9.1. Baseline  
 
Baseline  procedures  must  be completed  within  24 hours  before  the start  of the first dose  of IV study  drug.  
Potential  subjects  who  do not meet  entrance  criteria  may,  as appropriate,  repeat  baseline  evaluations  at a 
later time  for possible  enrollment  into the study.  
 
• Obtain informed  consent  in writing  from  parent(s)  or legally  acceptable  representative(s)  and assent  
from  subject  (as applicable)  before  initiating  any study  assessment  or procedure.  
 
• Collect  demographic  information including age, gender,  race  and ethnicity.  
 
• Clinical  Assessments  (assessments will be perform ed for research unless they are already being perform ed 
per standard of care; exceptions are indicated ): 
 
o Obtain a complete  medical and surgical  history,  including  history of  surgical procedures  for 
complications  of hematogenous  SA osteomyelitis  (eg, drainage  of the bone)  and all active  conditions  
and all conditions  diagnosed  within  the previous  5 years  (from  the following  categories:  allergic;  
cardiovascular;  dermatological;  gastrointestinal;  genital  and reproductive;  head,  eyes,  ears,  nose, 
and throat;  hematology;  hepatic;  immunological;  metabolic  and endocrine;  musculoskeletal;

 neurologic;  psychiatric;  renal;  and respiratory ). 
 
o Record  prior  medications  (Section  8.3) taken  or received  within  14 days  before  the first dose  of 
study  drug.  For children  who  are being  breast  fed, record  all medications  taken  by the lactating  
mother  during  the 3 days  before  the first dose  of IV study  drug.  In addition,  record  history  of 
pneumococcal  vaccinations.  
 
o Record standard  of care  radiology  results.   
o Record  the findings  of a complete  physical  examination  including physical findings  of hematogenous  
SA osteomyelitis (eg,  warmth,  tenderness,  swelling,  erythema,  and movement  of the infected 
extremity).  Involved  extremity  will be assessed as at enrollment,  if possible.  Most  of the subjects  
are expected  to have  surgical incision and drainage  procedures  and thus  assessing the extremity  for 
swelling,  erythema,  warmth  and tenderness  may  not be possible  because  of drains  in place  and 
large  surgical dressings  that cannot  be removed.  
o Record  height  and weight.  
 
o Record  vital signs:  resting  pulse,  blood  pressure,  and respiratory  rate;  and highest  daily  
temperature  (Tmax) measured.  
 
o Identify,  assess,  and record  any AEs and SAEs  starting  from  the time  that informed  consent  is 
obtained.  
 
o Record adjunctive therapeutic procedures (eg, surgeries).  
 
Laboratory  Assessments  (assessments will be performed for research unless they are already being 
performed per standard of care;  exceptions are indicated ) 
 
o Any protocol -required  eligibility  laboratory evaluations  already  done  locally as part of the subject’s  
regular medical care  within  24 hours  before the start of the first dose  of IV study  drug  do not have  
to be repeated  for purposes  of this study.  
 
o Collect  complete  blood  count  (CBC)  with  differential and CRP,  ESR,  BUN,  and Creatinine  lab results . 
 
o Blood  cultures  per standard of care.  
 
o Obtain  blood samples for  Alkaline  Phosphatase,  Bilirubin,  AST and ALT.  
 
o Obtain  blood  sample  for Direct  Coombs  test.  
 
o Obtain  urine  sample  for pregnancy  test (for a female  who has  reached  menarche);  ensure  that the 
test is negative  before  enrollment.  
o Estimate  CrCl using  the updated Schwartz  “bedside”  formula (Schwartz  et al, 2009): 
CrCl (mL/min/1.73m2) = 0.413  x height  (length) (cm) 
serum  creatinine  (mg/dL)  
o Collect  purulent  material from  bone  only  if a procedure  is performed for standard  of care.  
 
• Enroll  subject  after  verifying  that the subject  meets  all study  inclusion  and no exclusion  criteria.  There  
IND 124109   Grant ID: TEF -IT-43/IIT -2017 -10048

 should  be no medically  inappropriate  delay  in enrollment  and subsequent  administration  of IV  study  
drug.  
 
9.2. Study Day 1  
 
• Study  Drug Administration:  
 
IV ceftaroline  fosamil  15 mg/kg  (or 600 mg if > 40 kg) infused  over  120 (± 10) minutes  q8h (± 1 hour)  for 
children 2 years  of age – 17 years of age  (inclusive).  
 
IV ceftaroline  fosamil 10 mg/kg  infused  over  120 (± 10) minutes  q 8h (±  1 hour)  for children from  
1 year  of age to < 2 years  (inclusive).  
 
The following Clinical and Laboratory Assessments for Study Day 1 do not  need to be repeated if dosing of 
study medicine is done on the same day as the baseline visit:  
 
• Clinical  Assessments  - after at least  1 dose  of IV study  drug  (assessments will be performed for research 
unless they are already being p erformed per standard of care; e xceptions are indicated ): 
 
o Record  concomitant  medications  (Section  8.3).  For subjects  who  are being  breast  fed, record  all 
medications  taken  by the lactating  mother.  
 
o Record  resting  vital  signs  (pulse,  blood  pressure,  and respiratory  rate),  and highest  postdose  
temperature  measured.  
 
o Record  adjunctive  therapeutic  procedures  (eg, surgeries).  
 
o Record standard  of care  radiology  results.  
 
o Evaluate  and record physical  findings  of hematogenous  SA osteomyelitis  (eg, warmth,  tenderness,  
swelling,  erythema,  and movement  of the infected  extremity).  Most  of the subjects  are expected  to 
have  surgical incision and drainage  procedures  and thus  assessing  the extremity  for swelling,  
erythema,  warmth  and tenderness  may  not be possible  because  of drains  in place  and large  surgical 
dressings  that cannot  be removed. The degree  of the subject’s  ability to ambulate  will be assessed  
if the osteomyelitis  is in the lower  extremity -i.e. walks  unaided, able  to bear weight,  can walk aid  
using a walker,  etc. The use of upper  and lower  extremities  will be assessed  in terms  of movement 
and range  of motion.  
 
o Identify,  assess,  and record  any new  or ongoing  AEs or SAEs  
 
• Laboratory  Assessments  - after at least  1 dose  of IV study  drug  (assessments will be performed for research 
unless they are already being performed per standard of care; exceptions are indicated ) 
 
o If clinically  indicated,  calculate  CrCl using the  updated  Schwartz  “bedside”  formula  (Schwartz  et 
al, 2009).  
 
o Collect  results  of blood  cultures  only if conducted per standard of care.  
 
o Collect  purulent  material from  bone  only  if a procedure  is performed  for standard of 
care.

 9.3. Study Days 2 -14 
 
The total  duration of IV ceftaroline  is dependent  on the subject's response to therapy  but 5 -14 days is  
anticipated in most subjects.  If the subject is able to switch  to oral drug before Day 15, the procedures  
outlined  for Day 15 (EOIV) should be  performed.  The rest of the visit schedule  will be followed  as described  
in Table  2.1. 
• Study  Drug Administration:  
 
IV ceftaroline  fosamil 15 mg/kg  (or 600 mg if > 40 kg) infused  over  120 (± 10) minutes  q8h (± 1 hour)  for 
children 2 years  of age – 17 years of age  (inclusive).  
 
IV ceftaroline  fosamil 10 mg/kg  infused  over  120 (± 10) minutes  q 8h (±  1 hour)  for children from  
1 year  of age to < 2 years  (inclusive)  until  the subject  transitions  to oral therapy.  
 
• Clinical  Assessments  – any time  during study  day (assessments will be performed for research unless they 
are already being performed per standard of care; exceptions are indicated ): 
o Record  concomitant  medications  (Section  8.3). For subjects  who  are being  breast  fed, 
record  all medications  taken  by the lactating  mother.  
 
o Record  resting  vital  signs  (pulse,  blood  pressure,  and respiratory  rate),  and highest  
postdose  temperature  measured.  
 
o Record  adjunctive  therapeutic  procedures  (eg, surgeries).  
 
o Record standard  of care  radiology  results.  
 
o Evaluate  and record physical  findings  of hematogenous  SA osteomyelitis  (eg, warmth,  
tenderness,  swelling,  erythema,  and movement  of the infected  extremity).  Most  of the 
subjects are expected  to have  surgical  incision  and drainage  procedures  and thus  assessing  
the extremity  for swelling,  erythema,  warmth and tenderness  may  not be possible  
because  of drains  in place and large  surgical dressings  that cannot  be removed. The degree  
of the subject’s  ability  to ambulate  will be assessed  if the  osteomyelitis is in the  lower  
extremity -ie. walks  unaided, able to bear weight,  can walk  aid using a walker,  etc. The use 
of upper  and lower  extremities  will be assessed  in terms  of movement  and range  of 
motion.  
 
o Identify,  assess,  and record  any new  or ongoing  AEs or SAEs  
 
• Laboratory  Assessments – any time  during the study  period  if clinically indicated  (assessments will be 
performed for research unless they are already being performed per standard of care; exceptions are 
indicated ): 
○ Collect  CRP and ESR lab results , if clinically indicated.   
 
o Collect  CBC with  differential,  BUN,  and Creatinine,  lab results , if clinically indicated.   
 
o Obtain  blood sample  for Alkaline  Phosphatase, Bilirubin,  AST and ALT, if clinically indicated.   
 
○ If clinically  indicated,  estimate  CrCl using the  updated  Schwartz  “bedside”  formula  (Schwartz  et al, 
2009).  
 
○ Collect  results  of blood cultures only if conducted per standard of care.

v5.0 ( 08Oct 2018 )  Page 32 of 49 
  
○ Collect  purulent  material from  bone only  if a procedure  is performed  for standard of  care when 
possible.  
 
• PK Procedures:  
 
o Efforts  will be made  to obtain  1 PK blood  sample  (approximately  0.6 mL) at steady  state  from  all 
subjects  who received  ceftaroline  fosamil on Days  2 to 5 of treatment  (only  one PK sample  
collected  on days  2-5) 4 hours  (+/- 30 minutes) after the end of the infusion (before  the start  of 
the next  infusion).  PK samples  may  be collected  after any infusion of ceftaroline  fosamil on those  
days  and before  oral switch.  
 
o If purulent  material is being  obtained  from  bone  or subperiosteal  abscesses  at surgery  or via 
drainage  by interventional  radiology,  we will attempt  to obtain  specimens for  measurement  of 
ceftaroline  concentrations.  
 
9.4. Study Day 15  (End of  IV Treatment -EOIV)  
 
The total  duration  of IV  ceftaroline  is dependent  on the subject’s  response  to therapy  but 5-14 days  is 
anticipated in most  subjects.  If the subject  is able  to switch to oral drug before  Day 15, these procedures  
may  be performed  before  Day 15. Conduct  EOIV  assessments  within  24 hours  after  administration  of the 
last dose  of IV  study  drug (subjects will likely  remain  in the hospital  for less than 24 hours  once  they  are 
transitioned  to oral therapy  as per standard  of care)  or at time  of premature  discontinuation  of study  drug  
or early  withdrawal from  study  (if on IV study  drug).  Conduct  the EOIV  assessments  in place  of the regular 
study  visit assessments  that would  have  been  performed  the day of that visit.  A subject  may  be eligible  to 
switch  to PO  drug on or after  Study  Day 3 (Section  9.2).  EOIV  assessments  must  occur  before  starting  PO 
drug.   The rest of the visit schedule  should be followed as described  in Table  2.1. 
 
If applicable,  as IV study  drug may  or may  not be given  on the same  calendar day as EOIV  assessments, 
administer IV study drug  IV ceftaroline  fosamil  15 mg/kg  (or 600 mg if > 40 kg) infused  over  120 (± 10) minutes  
q8h (± 1 hour)  for children 2 years  of age – 17 years of age  (inclusive).  
 
IV ceftaroline  fosamil 10 mg/kg  infused  over  120 (± 10) minutes  q 8h (±  1 hour)  for children from  
1 year  of age to < 2 years  (inclusive)  until  the subject  transitions  to oral therapy.  
 
• Clinical  Assessments  - any time  during  study  day, but before  starting  PO study  drug,  if applicable  
(assessments will be performed for research unless they are already being performed per standard of 
care; exceptions are indicated):  
 
o Record  concomitant  medications  (Section  8.3). For subjects who  are being breast  fed, record  all 
medications  taken  by the lactating  mother.  
 
o Record  vital signs:  resting  pulse,  blood  pressure,  and respiratory  rate;  and highest  daily  
temperature  measured.  
 
o Record  adjunctive  therapeutic  procedures  (eg, surgeries).  
o Record standard  of care  radiology  results.  
o Evaluate  and record physical  findings  of hematogenous  SA osteomyelitis  (eg, warmth,  tenderness,  
swelling,  erythema,  and movement  of the infected  extremity).  Most  of the subjects  are expected

v5.0 ( 08Oct 2018 )  Page 33 of 49 
 to have  surgical incision and drainage  procedures  and thus  assessing  the extremity  for swelling,  
erythema,  warmth  and tenderness  may  not be possible  because  of drains  in place  and large  
surgical dressings  that cannot  be removed.  The degree  of the subject’s  ability to ambulate  will be 
assessed  if the osteomyelitis  is in the lower  extremity -ie.  Walks unaided, able  to bear weight,  can 
walk aid  using a walker,  etc. The use of upper  and lower  extremities  will be assessed  in terms  of 
movement and range  of motion.  
 
o Assess  clinical outcome  (site  of infection has  complete  resolution  of pain,  swelling and warmth  
and the  patient  is able  to use the affected  extremity  normally  and is back  to normal  activities).  
 
o Identify,  assess,  and record  any new  or ongoing  AEs or SAEs.  Subjects  will likely  remain  in the 
hospital for less than  24 hours  once  they  are transitioned  to oral therapy  as per standard of care.  
 
• Laboratory  Assessments-  any time  during  study  day, but before  starting  PO drug,  if applicable.  If these  
assessments are performed  within  48 hours  of latest  results,  do not repeat  these  assessments 
(assessments will be performed for research unless they are already being performed per standard of 
care; exceptions are indicated):  
 
o Collect  CRP and ESR lab results .   
 
o Collect  CBC with  differential,  BUN,  and Creatinine.  
 
o Obtain  blood sample  for AST,  ALT,  Alkaline  Phosphatase,  Bilirubin  and Direct Coombs . 
 
o If clinically  indicated,  estimate  CrCl using the  updated  Schwartz  “bedside”  formula  (Schwartz  et al, 
2009).  
 
o Collect  results  of blood cultures for S. aureus  only if conducted per standard  of care. 
 
o Collect  purulent  material from  bone  only  if a procedure  is performed  for standard of  care  
when possible.  
 
9.5. Week 2, Week 4, and Week 6 After Discharge  
 
• PO drug  administration:  
 
o PO clindamycin 13  mg/kg/dose  q8h in subjects with  proven  MRSA infection due  to clindamycin  
susceptible  MRSA  or when  no pathogen is isolated.  
OR 
o PO cephalexin  25 to 33 mg/kg/dose  q 8 hours  in subjects with  proven  MSSA  infection.  
OR 
o PO linezolid 600  mg q12h (Children > 12 years  old) or 10 mg/kg  q8h (children  < 12 years  old) in 
subjects with clindamycin -resistant  MRSA pathogens.  
 
Clinical Assessments - any time during study  day (assessments will be performed for research unless they are 
already being performed per standard of care; exceptions are indicated):  
 
o Obtain  an interval medical and surgical history  focusing on the involved  extremity,  including history

bone)  and all active  conditions  from the following categories.   
 
o Record concomitant  medications  (Section  8.3). For subjects who  are being breast  fed, record all 
medications  taken  by the lactating  mother.  
 
o Record vital  signs:  resting pulse, blood pressure,  and respiratory  rate.  
 
o Record adjunctive  therapeutic  procedures  (eg, surgeries).  
 
o Record standard  of care  radiology  results.  
 
o Evaluate  and record physical  findings  of hematogenous  SA osteomyelitis  (eg, warmth,  tenderness,  
swelling,  erythema,  and movement  of the infected  extremity).  Most  of the subjects  are expected  to 
have  surgical incision and drainage  procedures  and thus  assessing  the extremity  for swelling,  
erythema,  warmth  and tenderness  may  not be possible  because  of drains  in place  and large  surgical 
dressings  that cannot  be removed.  The degree  of the subject’s ability  to ambulate  will be assessed  
if the osteomyelitis  is in the lower  extremity -ie. walks  unaided, able  to bear weight,  can walk aid  
using a walker,  etc. The use of upper  and lower  extremities  will be assessed  in terms  of movement 
and range  of motion.  
 
o Assess  clinical  outcome  (site  of infection has  complete  resolution  of pain,  swelling  and warmth  
and the  patient  is able  to use the affected  extremity  normally  and is back  to normal  activities).  
 
o Identify, assess, and record  any new  or ongoing AEs or SAEs.  
 
Laboratory  Assessments - any time  during study  day, but before  starting PO  study  drug,  if applicable  
(assessments will be performed for research unless they are already being performed per standard of care; 
exceptions are indicated):  
 
o Collect  CRP and ESR lab results , if clinically indicated for standard of care.  
 
o If clinically  indicated,  estimate  CrCl using the  updated  Schwartz  “bedside”  formula  (Schwartz  et al, 
2009).  
 
9.6. End of Antibiotic Therapy  (EOT) /Week 4/ OR Week 6  
 
Note that EOT vi sit and assessments may occur at  the Week 4 visit or th e Week 6 visit.   If the EOT visit occurs 
on the same day as the  Week 4 or Week 6 visit, only the EOT visit will be recorded in CTMS.  
 
• If applicable,  as PO drug  may  or may  not be given  on the same  calendar  day as EOT assessments,  
administer PO drug as described  in Section  9.2. 
 
• Clinical  Assessments - any time  during  visit (assessments will be performed for research unless they are

9.8. Safety Lab Tests  
9.8.1.  Study Required Lab Tests  
 
Alkaline  Phosphatase,  Bilirubin,  AST, ALT and Direct Coombs (DATscreen)  will be obtained  within  24 hours  
prior  to enrollment ; and at the completion  of ceftaroline  treatment (EOIV visit).  
 
Isolate  susceptibilities:  The ceftaroline  MIC of S. aureus  isolates  or other  isolates  such as Group A 
streptococcus,  Streptococcus  pneumoniae or Kingella  kingae  that are obtained  from  the patients  with  acute  
hematogenous  osteomyelitis  will be determined using Clinical and  Laboratory  Standards  Institute  (CLSI)  
methods.  These  will be performed  in the CAP certified Infectious  Disease  Research  Laboratory.  CLSI 
interpretive  breakpoints  will be  used  to determine  if the isolate  is susceptible,  intermediate  or resistant  to 
ceftaroline.  The samples  will be  obtained  from  pathology  (from  already  collected  samples)  to conduct  the 
Isolate  susceptibility  studies.  
 
9.8.2.  Standard of Care Labs  
 
Record the  following  local  safety labs  if performed  per standard of care:  hemoglobin,  hematocrit,  WBC,  
platelet  count,  BUN,  serum  creatinine , CRP and ESR .  If multiple  laboratory  tests are obtained  on the same  
day,  record  test results  closest  to administration  of study  drug.  
 
9.8.3.  PK Assessments  
 
The pharmacokinetic  (PK) outcome measures  will include  concentrations  of ceftaroline,  ceftaroline  fosamil 
(prodrug),  and ceftaroline  M-1 (inactive  metabolite)  in plasma in subjects  on days  2 to 5 of treatment  (only  
one PK sample  collected  on days 2-5) 4 hours  (+/- 30 minutes)  after  the end of the infusion (before  the start  
of the next  infusion).  Efforts  will be made  to obtain  1 PK blood sample  (approximately  0.6 mL) at steady  
state  from  all subjects  who receive  ceftaroline  fosamil.  PK samples  may  be collected after  any infusion of 
ceftaroline  fosamil  on those  days  and before  oral switch.  
 
If purulent  material is being  obtained  from  bone  or sub periosteal  abscesses  at surgery  or via drainage  by 
interventional  radiology,  we will attempt  to obtain specimens for  measurement  of ceftaroline  
concentrations.  
 
All samples  will be sent  to Keystone  Bioanalytical,  Inc. for analysis.  
 
9.9. Diagnostic  Imaging and Non- Pharmacological Assessments  
 
All diagnostic  imaging procedures  including x-ray or MRIs,  in accordance with  routine  standard  of care,  will 
be recorded  on the study  eCRF.  Non-pharmacologic  treatments/procedures  (such  as surgeries)  performed  
in accordance  with  routine  standard of care  will be recorded  on the study  eCRF.

10. SAFETY  ASSESSMENTS  
 
Subjects  must  be seen  by a physician  or an  appropriately  trained  healthcare  professional  at every  study  
visit,  and the evaluation  must  be documented.  The procedures  discussed  below  will be completed  at the 
designated  visits  as outlined  in Section  10.0.  
 
10.1. Adverse Events  
 
An AE is  any untoward  medical occurrence  in a clinical  investigation  subject  administered  a pharmaceutical 
product  and which  does  not necessarily  have  to have  a causal relationship  with  this treatment.  An AE can  
therefore  be any unfavorable  and unintended  sign (including an abnormal  laboratory  finding,  for example),  
symptom,  or disease  temporally  associated  with  the use of a medicinal product,  whether  or not considered 
related  to the medicinal product.  
 
Examples  of AEs are as follows:  
 
• Changes  in the general  condition  of the subject.  
 
• Subjective  symptoms  offered  by or elicited  from  the subject.  
 
• Objective  signs  observed  by the Investigator  or other  study  personnel.  
 
• All diseases  that occur  after the start  of the study,  including  any change  in severity  or frequency  of 
preexisting  disease.  
 
• All clinically  relevant  abnormalities  in laboratory  values  or clinically  relevant  physical  findings  that occur  
during the study.  
 
10.2. Causality and Severity Assessments 
 
The causality  assessment  must  be recorded  on the appropriate  AE CRF.  Causal relationship  must  be assessed  
by answering  the following  question:  
 
Is there a reasonable  possibility  the study  drug  caused the event?  
 
Yes:  There is evidence  to suggest  a causal  relationship  between  the study  drug and AE, ie,: 
 
o There is a reasonable  temporal  relationship  between  the study  drug and the event,  and 
 
o The event  is unlikely  to be  attributed  to underlying/concurrent  disease, other  drugs,  or other  
factors,  and/or  
 
o Positive  de-challenge  and/or  re-challenge  exist  
 
No: There is no evidence  to suggest  a causal relationship  between  the study  drug and  AE, ie,: 
 
o There is no reasonable  temporal  relationship  between  the study  drug and the event,  or 
 
o The subject  did not take  the study  drug,  or 
IND 124109   Grant ID: TEF -IT-43/IIT -2017 -10048 
 
v5.0 ( 08Oct 2018 )  Page 38 of 49 
  
o The event  is likely  to be  attributed  to underlying/concurrent  disease,  other  drugs,  or other  
factors,  or 
 
o The event  is commonly  occurring  in the (study)  population  independent  of drug exposure  
The Investigator  must  provide  an assessment  of the severity  of each  AE by recording  a severity  rating  on the 
appropriate  AE screen(s) of the subject’s  eCRF.  Severity,  which  is a description of the intensity  of 
manifestation  of the AE, is distinct  from  seriousness,  which  implies  a subject  outcome  or AE-required  
treatment measure  associated  with a threat  to life  or functionality  (Section 11.1.2).  Severity  will be assessed  
according  to the following  scale.  
 
Mild:  Minor  awareness  of signs  or symptoms  that are easily  tolerated  without  specific  
medical  intervention.  
Moderate:  Discomfort  that interferes  with  usual  activities  and may  require  minimal  intervention.  
Severe:  Significant  signs  or symptoms  that are incapacitating  with  an inability  to work  or 
perform  routine  activities  and/or  that require  medical  intervention.  
 
10.3. Serious Adverse Events/Suspected Adverse Reaction  
 
 An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered "serious" if, in the view of either the 
investigator or sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes : 
 
• Results  in death 
 
• Results in a life  threatening  adverse event  
 
• Requires  in-patient  hospitalization  or prolongation  of existing  hospitalization  
 
• Results  in persistent  or significant  disability/incapacity  or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct 
normal life functions  
 
• Is a congenital  anomaly/birth  defect  
 
Important  medical  events  that may  not result  in death,  be life threatening,  or require  hospitalization  may  be 
considered serious  when,  based on appropriate  medical  judgment,  they  may  jeopardize  the subject  and may  
require  medical  or surgical  intervention  to prevent  one of the outcomes  listed  in this definition. Examples  of 
such  medical  events  include  allergic  bronchospasm  requiring intensive  treatment  in an emergency  room or 
at home,  blood  dyscrasias  or convulsions  that do not  result  in in-patient  hospitalization,  or the development  
of drug  dependency  or drug abuse.  
 
Suspected adverse reaction  means any adverse event for which there is a reasonable possibility that the 
drug caused the adverse event. For the purposes of IND safety reporting, "reasonable possibility" means 
there is evidence to suggest a causal relationsh ip between the drug and the adverse event. Suspected 
adverse reaction implies a lesser degree of certainty about causality than adverse reaction, which means any 
adverse event caused by a drug.  
 
Unexpected adverse event  or unexpected suspected adverse reac tion.  An adverse event or suspected 
adverse reaction is considered "unexpected" if it is not listed in the investigator brochure or is not listed at 
the specificity or severity that has been observed; or, if an investigator brochure is not required or avai lable, 
is not consistent with the risk information described in the general investigational plan or elsewhere in the 
IND 124109   Grant ID: TEF -IT-43/IIT -2017 -10048 
 
v5.0 ( 08Oct 2018 )  Page 39 of 49 
 current application, as amended. For example, under this definition, hepatic necrosis would be unexpected 
(by virtue of greater severity) i f the investigator brochure referred only to elevated hepatic enzymes or 
hepatitis. Similarly, cerebral thromboembolism and cerebral vasculitis would be unexpected (by virtue of 
greater specificity) if the investigator brochure listed only cerebral vascula r accidents. "Unexpected," as 
used in this definition, also refers to adverse events or suspected adverse reactions that are mentioned in 
the investigator brochure as occurring with a class of drugs or as anticipated from the pharmacological 
properties of the drug, but are not specifically mentioned as occurring with the particular drug under 
investigation.  
 
Emergency  room visits  that do not result  in hospitalization  (ie, an overnight  stay)  should be evaluated  for 
one of the other  serious  outcomes  to determine  if they  qualify  as SAEs.  
 
Preplanned  hospitalizations  (eg, elective  procedures  for preexisting  conditions  that did not  worsen)  are 
excluded  from  SAE reporting.  
 
Study  endpoints  (eg, mortality  or major morbidity)  must be reported  to FDA by the Sponsor  as described in 
the protocol  and ordinarily  would  not be reported  under  paragraph  (c) of the CFR § 312.32.  However,  if a 
serious  and unexpected AE occurs  for which  there  is evidence  suggesting  a causal  relationship  between  the 
drug and the event (eg, death  from  anaphylaxis),  the event  must be reported  under  CFR § 312.32(c)(1)(i) as a 
serious  and unexpected  suspected adverse  reaction  even  if it is a component  of the study  endpoint  (eg, all-
cause  mortality).  
 
The new  regulations  require  that “study  endpoints  (eg, mortality  or major morbidity)  must  be reported  
according  to the protocol  instead  of as IND safety  reports  except  when  there is evidence  suggesting  a 
causal  relationship  between  the drug and the event.”  
 
Any worsening  of hematogenous  SA osteomyelitis under  study  because  of lack of therapeutic  effect  of any 
study  drug (reported  within  study  endpoints  reporting  time  frame)  is captured  as an efficacy  endpoint  and 
is, therefore,  excluded  from  SAE reporting,  unless  the event  is considered related  to the drug.  
 
10.4. Follow Up of Serious  Adverse Events  
 
When  additional relevant  information becomes  available,  the investigator  will record follow -up 
information according to the same  process  used  for reporting the initial event as described  above.  The 
investigator  will follow  all SAEs until  resolution,  stabilization,  or the event  is otherwise  explained.  DRC  will 
follow  all SAEs  until  resolution,  stabilization,  until  otherwise explained,  or until  the last patient  completes  
the final  follow -up, whichever  occurs  first.  
 
10.5. Collecting and Reporting  Adverse Events  and Serious  Adverse Events  
 
Research  related  AEs and SAEs  are collected  from  the signing  of the informed  consent  form  (ICF)  (and  assent  
form,  if applicable)  until  EOT.  At Month  12 follow  up problems  such as pathologic  fractures  and growth  
disturbances  will be evaluated.  The investigational  site personnel  are to follow unresolved  AEs and SAEs  at 
EOT until  resolution  or stabilization.  
 
At each  visit,  subjects  and/or  their  parent(s)  (or other  legally  acceptable  representative[s]) are  to be 
queried  regarding  any new or ongoing  AEs/SAEs  that have  occurred since  the previous  visit.  Each,  as 
appropriate,  will be asked  to volunteer  information  with  a non- leading  question  such as, for the subjects, 
“How  have  you felt since  your  last visit?”  Study  center  personnel  will then  record  all pertinent  information  
on the appropriate  screens  of the subject’s  eCRF.  
 
IND 124109   Grant ID: TEF -IT-43/IIT -2017 -10048 
 
v5.0 ( 08Oct 2018 )  Page 40 of 49 
 All research  related  AEs/SAEs  reported  by the subject  or subject’s  parent(s)  (or legally  acceptable  
representative[s])  or observed  or otherwise  identified  by the Investigator  (or other  study  site personnel)  at 
a defined  study  visit or during  any communication  with  the subject  (or subject’s  representative[s])  
occurring  outside  a defined study  visit must  be documented.  
 
All research  related  AEs must be  recorded  on the appropriate  CRF,  whether  or not they  are considered 
causally  related  to the  study  drug.  
 
For every  AE, the Investigator  must:  
 
• Provide  an assessment  of the severity,  causal relationship  to the study  drug),  and seriousness  of the event  
(ie, SAE). 
 
• Document  all actions  taken  with  regard  to the  study  drug.  
 
• Detail any other  treatment  measures  taken  for the AE. 
 
Within  24 business hours  of learning  of any AE that  meets  one of the criteria for an SAE,  the study  center  
personnel  must  report  the event  to Allergan  on an SAE/AESI form  (Global Patient Safety & Epidemiology 
Form)  and to the FDA and IRB per regulation/local IRB policy . 
 
If, during follow -up, any nonserious  AE worsens  and eventually  meets  the criteria for an SAE,  that AE 
should  be recorded  as a new  SAE.  
 
The PI will transmit  the SAE/AESI Form  to the email and fax number indicated on the most current version 
of the form . Even  if an initial report  is made  by telephone,  an SAE/AESI form  completed  with  all available  
details  must  still be emailed/ faxed  within  24 business hours  of knowledge  of the event  at the study  center.  
 
Supplemental  information  shall be submitted  as soon  as available  and may  include  laboratory  results,  
radiology  reports,  progress  notes,  hospital  admission  and emergency  room  notes,  holding and observation  
notes,  discharge  summaries,  autopsy  reports,  and death  certificates.  
 
The Investigator is expected  to take  all therapeutic  measures  necessary  for resolution  of the SAE/AE. Any 
medications  or procedures  necessary  for treatment  of the SAE/AE must  be recorded  on the appropriate  
screen(s)  of the subject’s  CRF.  All SAEs /AEs  are to be  followed until  resolution  or until  the SAE/AE is deemed  
stable.  The Sponsor  may  contact  the study  center  to solicit  additional  information  or follow  up on the event.  
 
10.6. Other Reportable Events –  Pregnancy  
 
Study  center  personnel  must  report  every  pregnancy  on a Clinical  Trial Pregnancy  Form  as soon  as possible  
(within  24 business hours  of learning  of the pregnancy)  to the email/ fax number  as indicated on the form,  
even  if no AE has occurred.  Pregnancies  in female  partners  of male  subjects  must  also be reported.  The 
pregnancy  must  be followed  to term and the outcome  reported  by completing  the Clinical Trial Pregnancy  
Form.  If, however,  the pregnancy  is associated  with  an SAE (eg, if the mother  is hospitalized  for 
hemorrhage),  in addition  to the Clinical  Trial Pregnancy  Form,  a separate  SAE/AESI Form  for Clinical  Trials  
must  be filed  as described  in Section  11.1.3  with  the appropriate  serious  criterion  (eg, hospitalization)  
indicated  on the SAE/AESI Form . 
 
10.7. IND Safety Reports  
 
For serious  adverse  events  that require  expedited regulatory  reporting under  21 CFR 312.32(c)(1),  the PI 
will notify  the FDA in a written  Investigational  New  Drug  (IND)  safety  report  and report to the IRB per local 
IND 124109   Grant ID: TEF -IT-43/IIT -2017 -10048 
 
v5.0 ( 08Oct 2018 )  Page 41 of 49 
 policy . 
 
10.8. Other Clinical Assessments  
 
Safety  parameters  will be monitored  according  to standard  medical  practice  and guidelines  for IV 
administration  of study  drug.  Vital  sign assessments (pulse,  blood  pressure,  respiratory  rate,  and 
temperature)  will be conducted  at the specified  time  points  outlined  in the Schedule  of Assessments  and 
Procedures  (Table  2-1) and Section 10.0.  
 
Medical and surgical history,  prior  and concomitant  medications,  height  (length),  weight,  physical  
examination  findings,  and hematogenous  SA osteomyelitis  sign and symptom  assessments will be 
recordedat  baseline  and if  applicable,  during study  according  to the Schedule  of Assessments and 
Procedures  (Table  2–1) and Section 10.0.  
 
10.9. Laboratory Assessments  
 
Blood  samples  for clinical  laboratory  tests  and urine  samples  for pregnancy  tests  (females  who have  reached  
menarche  only)  will be collected  at baseline  and throughout  the study  according  to the Schedule   of 
Assessments  and Procedures  (Table  2–1) and Section 10.0.  If a subject’s  estimated  CrCl (as calculated  using  
the updated Schwartz  “bedside”  formula;  Schwartz  et al, 2009)  decreases  to < 50 mL/min  during  the 
treatment period,  the DRC should  be contacted.  If a subject’s  hemoglobin or hematocrit  decreases  
significantly  (Investigator’s  judgment)  during  IV study  drug therapy,  an evaluation  for hemolytic  anemia  will 
be conducted  per standard  of care.  
 
11. DATA MANAGEMENT  
 
An institutional  Electronic  Data Capture  (EDC) system,  the Clinical  Trials  Management  System  (CTMS),  will 
be used  for this trial.  Study  specific  electronic  case report  forms  (eCRFs)  designed  to provide  reliable  and 
secure  data  entry  for clinical  research  purposes  will be utilized.  The web  based  software  tools in  the CTMS  
employ  2048 -bit Secure  Socket  Layer  (SSL) encryption;  all transactions  are encrypted in both  directions.  
The CTMS  meets  the regulatory  requirements  of HIPAA  and 21 CFR Part 11 compliance.  In addition,  the 
system  has an offsite,  fully  mirrored disaster  recovery  backup.  
 
Data entered  into the CTMS  will include  a subject  study  identification number;  names  will not be linked 
with subject  data  in the database.  Study  staff will maintain records  linking the subject  name  with  the 
identification  number  assigned  for the study  in a secure  area.  
 
All data  changes  in the CTMS  are written to  an audit  trail that identifies  the user,  date  and time,  as well as 
the old  value  and new  value.  Both  patient -related  data  as well as trial configuration data are written  to the 
audit  trail. Data are saved  at regular intervals  during data  entry  to prevent loss  of information in the  event  
of a disruption  of the Internet  connection.  
 
The eCRFs  include  standa rd logical  checks  and range  checks,  as well as support  for multiple  languages  in 
the user  interface.   There is emphasis  on tracking  deadlines  and milestones  with automated notifications  
and reports  of study  progress.  The module  includes  a data  locking  mechanism to ensure  that data  
accuracy  and integrity  are maintained  to facilitate  data  analyses  promptly  after  study  completion.  
Several levels  of security  are employed  to ensure  privacy  and integrity of the study  data,  including the  
following:  
 
• Study  access  requires use  of assigned  unique  user  names  and passwords  that are modified  at specified  
time  intervals  
IND 124109   Grant ID: TEF -IT-43/IIT -2017 -10048 
 
v5.0 ( 08Oct 2018 )  Page 42 of 49 
 • Individual  roles  and access  levels  are assigned 
• Passwords  are changed  regularly  
• Data are not stored  on laptop computers  
The study  coordinator  will be responsible  for data  entry  and maintaining appropriate  source  
documentation.  Source  documentation refers  to original  records  of observations,  clinical findings  and 
evaluations  that are subsequently  recorded as data.  
The study  coordinator  will enter data within 7 days  of the screening visit  and within 14 days  of each  
subsequent visit.  
 
12. STATISTICAL  ASSUMPTIONS  
12.1. Statistical Methods and Planned Analysis  
 
• Descriptive  statistical  methods  will be used  to summarize  the demographic  characteristics  of the 
subjects as well as selected  clinical features  such  as duration  of fever  or positive  blood  cultures,  time  
until  normalization  of ESR and CRP.  
• The proportion  of children  with  plasma  concentrations  of ceftaroline  that exceed  1µg/mL  at 5-6 hours  
following  a 2 hour  infusion  of ceftaroline  dose  will be determined.  
• Safety  analyses  will be conducted on all subjects  who received  at least  one dose  of ceftaroline.  
 
12.2. Primary End Points  
 
• Assessment  of safety  of ceftaroline  in children during initial treatment  of acute  hematogenous  
osteomyelitis  at the end of intravenous  therapy.  
 
12.3. Secondary Endpoints  
 
1. Successful  treatment  of acute  hematogenous  osteomyelitis  at one year  after completion  of a 4 to 6 
week  total  antibiotic  treatment  and at one year  after  enrollment.  
2. Clearance  of S. aureus  bacteremia if blood  cultures  initially  positive.  
 
3. The proportion  of children with  plasma concentrations  of ceftaroline  that exceed  1µg/mL  for over  60%  
of a dosing  interval.  
 
12.4. Safety Analysis  
 
Adverse  event and serious  adverse  event  monitoring,  vital  signs  and laboratory  tests  (CBC,BUN, Creatinine,  
Bilirubin,  Alkaline  Phosphatase,   AST and ALT will be obtained within  24 hours  prior  to enrollment and 
weekly  during ceftaroline  treatment  and at the completion  of ceftaroline  treatment).  The Alkaline  
Phosphatase,  Bilirubin,  AST/ALT  results  may  not be available  prior  to enrollment  of the patient.  
We do not anticipate  that the AST/ALT  concentrations  will be > 3 UNL  but if they were  to be this elevated,  
the patient  subject  will be dropped  from the study  immediately.  
 
Safety parameters  include  AEs,  SAEs,  deaths,  clinical laboratory  parameters  (eg, hematology  parameters,  
chemistry  parameters),  and vital  signs.  For each  safety  parameter,  the last assessment  made  before  the 
first dose  of IV study  drug  will be used  as the baseline  for all analyses.  
 
The incidences  of TEAEs,  SAEs,  deaths,  and discontinuations  due to AEs  will be summarized  by system  organ  
class  and preferred  term  according  to the Medical  Dictionary  for Regulatory  Activities  by relationship  to 
the study  drug,  and by severity.

Descriptive  statistics  of observed  results  and the change  from  baseline  will be presented for  clinical  
laboratory  results,  and vital signs.  The incidence  of PCS laboratory  results  will be summarized.  
 
12.5. Efficacy  Analysis  
 
• Clinical response  by subject  and by  baseline  pathogen at the conclusion  of IV  ceftaro line. 
• Clinical outcome  at the completion  of total  therapy  (IV plus oral)  
• Clinical outcome  at one year  after enrollment into  study  long -term follow -up. 
 
12.6. Interim Analysis  
 
An interim  analysis  of pharmacokinetics  parameters  may  be performed  using data  from  the first 5 evaluable  
patients  to complete  the study.  The results  of this interim  analysis  may  be used  to confirm the planned 
Ceftaroline  dose,  or support  an appropriate  dose  adjustment.  Enrollment will not be held during  the 
interim PK analysis.  
 
12.7. PK Analysis  
 
The mean and median  concentrations  of ceftaroline  in plasma  at the end of infusion will  be determined.  
The proportion  of children  with  plasma  ceftaroline  concentrations  > 1 µg/mL  at 4 hours  after infusion  will 
be determined.  
 
The plasma  levels of ceftaroline  obtained  at 4 hours after the end of a 2 hour  infusion will be compared to 
the ceftaroline MIC for the S. aureus  isolate  recovered causing the osteomyelitis. Ideally, the  plasma level 
should exceed the  MIC at  this time  point which would  be for at least 75%  of a dosing interval.  Assuming 
the patients  do well  clinically,  there will be no adjustment of  the dose even  if the target concentration is 
not achieved  at the 6 hour time  point following the  start  of ceftaroline  infusion. However,  if two subjects 
do not  improve  as anticipated, the study will be halted and plasma levels compared  to the MICs  of the 
causative  S. aure us isolates.   If plasma levels exceed the MIC  and yet the subjects are considered treatment 
failures  in that they are not responded  as expected, the investigator would conclude  that ceftaroline may  
not be particularly  effective in treating S.  aureus osteomyelitis in  children. If the  plasma levels  at this time 
point are below the MIC,  a dose modification may  be considered  but the investigator may  decide that 
studying ceftaroline  for this indication is no longer  necessary.  
 
12.8. Handling of Dropouts a nd Missing  Data  
 
Every  effort  will be made  to collect  all data at specified  times.  All subjects  and data  will be assessed  up to the 
time  that the subject  is dropped.  Missing data  will be noted  in the CRFs.  
 
13. ADMINISTRATIVE ASPECTS

This study  will be conducted  in compliance  with  current  ICH E6 GCP pertaining  to informed  consent,  the 
current  CFR (Title  21, Parts  50 Subparts  B and D, 56 and 312).  For a child  to participate  in the study,  the 
child’s  parent(s)  or legally  authorized  representative(s)  will sign and date  the ICF at the first visit,  after 
having  been  informed  about  the nature  and purpose of the study,  participation  and termination  conditions,  
risks,  and benefits,  before  initiation  of any study -related  procedures.  A pediatric  subject  who  is                   old 
enough  to provide  assent,  will be asked  for such assent, according  to institution -specific  guidelines.  A copy  
of the signed  ICF (and  assent  form,  if applicable),  must  be provided  to the subject’s  parent(s)  or legally  
acceptable  representative(s).  If applicable,  the ICF (and  assent  form,  if applicable)  will be provided  in 
certified  translation  for non- English- speaking  subjects  and parents  or other  legally  acceptable  
representatives.  Signed  ICFs (and  assent  form, if applicable)  will remain  in the subjects’  study  files and be 
available  for verification  at any time.  
 
13.4. Confidentiality  
 
Personal  study  patient  data  collected  and processed  for the purposes  of this study  will be managed  by the 
investigator  and his/her  staff  with adequate  precautions  to ensure  the confidentiality of those  data,  and in 
accordance  with  applicable  national and/or  local laws  and regulations  on personal  data  protection.   
 
Monitors,  auditors  and other  authorized  agents  of Cempra  Pharmaceuticals,  the IRB approving this  
research,  and the FDA,  as well as any other  applicable  regulatory  authorities, will be  granted direct  access  
to the study  subjects’ original  medical  records  for verification  of clinical trial procedures  and/or  data,  
without  violating  the confidentiality  of the patients,  to the extent  permitted  by the law and regulations.  In 
any presentation of the results of this study  at meetings  or in  publications,  the patient  identities will remain  
confidential.

v5.0 ( 08Oct 2018 )  Page 45 of 49 
 be used  for this trial.  Study  specific  electronic  case report  forms  (eCRFs)  designed  to provide  reliable  and 
secure  data  entry  for clinical  research  purposes  will be utilized.  The web  based  software  tools in  the CTMS  
employ 2048 -bit Secure  Socket  Layer  (SSL) encryption;  all transaction s are encrypted in both  directions.  
The CTMS  meets  the regulatory  requirements  of HIPAA  and 21 CFR Part 11 compliance.  In addition,  the 
system  has an offsite,  fully  mirrored disaster  recovery  backup.  
 
Data entered  into the CTMS  will include  a subject  identifiers  and study  identification number;  the subject  
identifiers  other  that the study  identification  will not  be included  in the database  reports  when  required.  
All data  changes  in the CTMS  are written to  an audit  trail that identifies  the user,  date  and time,  as well as 
the old  value  and new  value.  Both  patient -related  data  as well as trial configuration data are written  to the 
audit  trail. Data  are saved  at regular intervals  during data  entry  to prevent loss  of information in the  event  
of a disruption  of the Internet  connection.  
 
The eCRFs  include  standard logical  checks  and range  checks,  as well as support  for multiple  languages  in 
the user  interface.   There  is emphasis  on tracking  deadlines  and milestones  with automated notifications  
and reports  of study  progress.  The module  includes  a data  locking  mechanism to ensure  that data  
accuracy  and integrity  are maintained  to facilitate  data  analyses  promptly  after  study  completion.  
Several levels  of security  are employed  to ensure  privacy  and integrity of the study  data,  including the  
following:  
• Study  access  requires use  of assigned  unique  user  names  and passwords  that are modified  at specified  
time  intervals  
• Individual  roles  and access  levels  are assigned 
• Passwords  are changed  regularly  
• Data are not stored  on laptop computers  
 
The study  coordinator  will be responsible  for data  entry  and maintaining appropriate  source  
documentation.  Source  documentation refers  to original records  of observations,  clinical findings  and 
evaluations  that are subsequently  recorded as data.  
The study  coordinator  will enter data  within 7 days  of the screening visit  and within 14 days  of each  
subsequent visit.

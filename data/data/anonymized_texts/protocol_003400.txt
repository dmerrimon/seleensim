 March 23, 
2018  
 The primary purpose of this a mendment is to document changes and 
updates to the following:  
 
• Key Roles –  Updated the Project Manager and Central Pharmacy 
Information. Biologics, Inc. was purchased by McKesson Specialty 
Health and all clinical trial pharmacy operations are moving to 
Texas in late March 2018.  
 
• Primary Study Endpoints – Clarified that an elevat ed SPCDAI due 
to a non- IBD reason does not count toward the primary endpoint. 
Also clarified that switching from the name brand infliximab or 
adalimumab to the corresponding biosimil ar does not constitute a 
study endpoint (i.e. discontinuation of the anti -TNF agent). 
Emphasized that any patient discontinuing their first -line anti -TNF 
for PCD for any reason must discontinue study medications. 
(Section 3.2)  
 
• Inclusion Criteria –  The use  of infliximab and adalimumab 
biosimilars is allowable for inclusion in th e trial. (Section 4.1)  
 
• Exclusion Criteria –  Increased the BMI cut -off from >95% to ≥98% 
to align with standard clinical practice of treating obese PCD 
patients with low dose oral methotrexate (but not morbidly obese 
patients). Clarified the exclusion for Clostridium difficile is  only for 
active infection, not applicable to colonization or infection controlled 
by treatment. (Section 4.2)

THERAPY   
 
Version: 10, June 23, 2021  CONFIDENTIAL  Page v  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
• Subject Recruitment –  Consultation with Resource Parents (parents 
of current study participants) will be offered to potential patients 
and/or parents who are approached regarding trial participation. 
(Section 4.3)  
 
• Discontinuation of Study Medication –  Separated this section from 
Early Withdrawal of Subjects. Clarified the circumstances under 
which study medications must be discontinued and provided 
reference to sections detailing discontinuation procedures and 
patient follow -up. (Section 4.4)  
 
• Early Withdrawal of Subjects – Clarified the term “withdrew 
consent” to mean that the patient / family chooses to fully 
discontinue participation in the tri al (not just discontinue the study 
medications). Also clarified that patients who withdraw after 
shipment of study medications will not be replaced by recruitment 
additional subjects. Those who withdraw prior to the first study 
medication shipment may be r eplaced. (Section 4.5)  
 
• Treatment Regimen –  Study providers may advise patients not to 
take folic acid on the day methotrexate / placebo is taken in 
according with their usual practice. Adjusted the window for 
randomization from no more than 35 days to no more than 42 days 
(before or after) the initiation of anti -TNF. (Section 5.2)  
 
• Prior and Concomitant Therapy –  Clarified that the exclusion for 
prior use of anti -TNF therapy is only for the indication of Crohn’s 
disease. Prior Anti -TNF use for another indi cation (i.e. juvenile 
idiopathic arthritis) is allowable. Added caution statements related 
to concomitant use of nitrous oxide anesthesia. (Section 5.7)  
 
• Visit Windows –  Expanded the visit windows for visits 1- 4 to 
accommodate a wide variety of clinical pr actice styles and to 
minimize out -of-window visit protocol deviations. (Sections 6.1, 6.3, 
6.4, 6.5)  
 
• Pregnancy testing – Changed the window from within 2 weeks of 
the screening visit to within 30 days of randomization to ensure the 
testing takes place in more consistent proximity to when the patient 
starts taking the study medication.    
 
• Phone follow -up – Modified this to “Follow -up contact” to 
accommodate a variety of follow -up methods. Phone is preferred, 
however, email, text or in- person visit are also acceptable. (Section 
6.2) 
 
• Visit 2 Laboratory tests –  Given the expanded visit window and 
possibility of a missed visit, added a requirement to draw and 
confirm initial safety labs between week 1 and week 6 after the 
patient starts the study medication. ( Section 6.3)  
 
• Study drug refill – Clarified that the request goes to the central 
pharmacy, not to the study site. (Sections 6.4, 6.5)  
LOW DOSE ORAL METHOTREXATE IN PEDIATRIC CROHN’S DISEASE PATIENTS INITIATING ANTI -TNF 
THERAPY   
 
Version: 10, June 23, 2021  CONFIDENTIAL  Page vi  
• Additional Labs (not associated with a visit) -  Added this section to 
provide guidance on documentation of lab values not  associated 
with a clinic visit (i.e. routine infusion labs). Documented results are 
limited to those associated with a prior abnormal lab result, 
specialty lab test, change in clinical status, or meeting protocol -
defined abnormal lab criteria for AST, ALT  and WBC. (Section 6.8 
and Section 8.4.3)  
 
• Study Medication Dose Change or Discontinuation –  Clarified the 
criteria and procedures for discontinuation of study medication as 
well as patient follow -up for those off study medication but still in 
follow -up. (Section 6.9)  
 
• Withdraw of consent – Clarified the definition of “withdrew consent” 
includes discontinuation of both study medication and all other IRB -
approved research activities (including use of routine visit 
information for trial purposes). (Section 6. 10) 
 
• Subject Population for Analysis –  Changed from an Intent to Treat 
to a modified Intent to Treat analysis. Only patients who were 
shipped the study medication will be included in the analysis. 
(Section 7.4)  
 
• Definition of an AE –  Changed from being an event “temporally 
associated with the use of the study drug” to an event which 
develops or worsens in severity “from the date of randomization”. 
(Section 8.1.1)  
 
• Recording of AEs and SAEs –  Increased the reporting period for 
non-serious AEs from 7 days to 14 days following the final dose of 
study medication. For patients who discontinue study medication 
early, but remain in study follow -up, non- serious AEs do not need 
to be recorded after the 14 day period following their last dose of 
study medication. SAEs  occurring from the date of randomization 
through the completion of the study will be recorded for all patients. 
For patients who continue on study medication through the end of 
the trial period (week 104), any SAE occurring within 14 days after 
their last  dose of study medication should also be recorded. 
(Section 8.3 and Section 8.5)  
 
• Recording and Evaluation of AEs –  Changed the evaluation of 
relationship and expectedness from solely the perspective of the 
study drug (per FDA guidance) to both the context  of the study drug 
and the procedures involved in the research (per OHRP guidance). 
(Section 8.3.1)  
 
• General Management of AEs –  Reiterated that any AE or SAE 
leading to a permanent discontinuation of study medication (study 
drug or anti -TNF intolerance or toxicity) meets the definition of a 
primary endpoint. (section 8.4.1)  
 
• Ethical Considerations –  Added language related to the possible 
recruitment of Spanish -speaking patients at select study sites.

medications may be dissolved in liquid prior to administration. 
Renumbered remaining criteria.  Modified “Abdominal or pelvic 
abscess within the last 3 months ” to “Concurrent abdominal or 
pelvic abscess. A recent history of abdominal or pelvic abscess, 
which is controlled does not exclude the subject.”    
(Section 4)  
 
• Treatment Regimen – Provided an opt -out for the provision of 
ondansetron / placebo based on provider’s clinical judgement of 
patient safety and maintenance of the blind. Allowed study 
medications to be dissolved and administered orally or by 
gastrostomy tube. Based the window of first anti -TNF 
administration on the randomization start date (instead of study 
treatment start date) and adjusted the window to 35 days.  
(Section 5.2)  
 
• Study Drug Dispensing, Return and Destruction –  Made minor 
process clarifications.  
(Section 5,6)  
 
• Screening – Extended the window for laboratory tests used to 
evaluate eligibility to not more than 90 days prior to randomization. 
Allowed the use of a prior exam for the screening exam if the 
patient is recruited in an in- patient or infusion / injection- teaching 
setting and the prior exam is not more than 30 days prior to the 
randomization date. Added a supplement to the trial -specific 
screening form to be completed for patients screened in an 
inpatient setting.  
(Section 6.1)  
 
• Bio samples –  Increased blood collection volume by 3mL to 
account for the size of the sourced venipuncture tubes. Clarified 
sample labeling with unique subject ID instead of a barcode.  
(Section 6.10)

Duration  4 years  
Study 
Centers  Multi -center with estimated 50 centers  
Objectives  1.  To determine whether, in children with Crohn’s disease ( CD) initiating anti -TNF (anti-
Tumor Necrosis Factor)  biological therapy  with infliximab or adalimumab, low -dose oral 
meth otrexate (MTX)  is more effective than placebo in the induction and subsequent 
maintenance of steroid- free remission for a treatment period of up to three years.  We 
hypothesize that the addition of MTX  to anti -TNF therapy will be more effective than 
placebo (i.e. anti -TNF monotherapy ).  
2.  To determine whether, in children with CD initiating anti -TNF biological therapy  with 
infliximab or adalimumab , low -dose oral MTX  leads to better Patient Reported 
Outcomes (PROs) as compared to placebo.  We hypothesize t hat the addition of MTX  
to anti -TNF therapy will result in better PROs than placebo (i.e. anti -TNF monotherapy).   
3.  To describe the investigator -reported adverse events  (AEs)  (Grade 2 or higher1) in 
PCD patients initiating anti -TNF, treated with low dose oral MTX  and in a placebo 
comparison group.  
4. To determine whether low -dose oral methotrexate, in combination with anti -TNF 
biological therapy, is more effective than anti -TNF monotherapy in reducing ant i-TNF 
antibody formation resulting in higher anti -TNF trough levels.   emai

THERAPY   
 
Version: 10, June 23, 2021  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 4 1 Introduction 
 
This document is a protocol for a human research study. This study is to be conducted 
according to US and international standards of Good Clinical Practice (Food and Drug 
Administration [ FDA] Title 21 part 50, part 56 and International Conference on Harmonization 
[ICH] guidelines) , applicable government regulations and Institutional research policies and 
procedures.  
1.1 Background  
1.1.1  Pediatric Crohn’s Di sease (PCD)  
Pediatric Crohn 's disease: a debilitating condition with expensive, complex, and risky 
treatment options  
Crohn’s disease is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) that affects approximately 
600,000 Americans2 with estimated direct costs of $3.6 billion annually.3  Typical symptoms 
(e.g., abdominal pain, bloody diarrhea)4 result in substantial morbidity, including hospitalization 
and surgery,5 missed work6 and school,7 and diminished quality of life.8 
 
Pediatric CD (PCD) is a distinct disease entity, clinically different than adult CD.  Since less than 
10% of CD patients (~38,000) are children, PCD is recognized as a rare disease by the National 
Institutes of Health ( NIH) Office of Rare Dis eases Research.9  PCD patients present with a more 
extensive distribution and rapid extension of the disease than seen in adult -onset CD and 
experience marked psychosocial difficulties and impairment in pubertal development and 
growth.10  In a U.S. multicenter inception cohort, ~8% of children required intestinal resection 
during the year following diagnosis.11  In a French cohort, t he cumulative incidence of surgery 
was 20% at 3 years and 34% at 5 years.12 
 
The primary treatment goals for all CD patients are to induce remission b y eradicating intestinal 
inflammation and related symptoms and maintain remission by preventing disease flares and 
progression.  Additional treatment goals for PCD include restoring physical and emotional 
development.  Until recently, medical treatment for  CD was limited to corticosteroids, 
aminosalicylates, and immunomodulators [6- mercaptopurine (6MP), azathioprine, and MTX ].  In 
1998, the FDA approval of infliximab, the fi rst anti -TNF biologic agent, revolutionized the 
treatment landscape for CD. (Pediatr ic approval was granted in 2006).  More recently, a number 
of additional anti -TNF and other biologics have been developed and FDA -approved based on 
placebo- controlled efficacy studies.4   
 
As the tre atment armamentarium continues to grow, there is an increasing paucity of clinical 
and comparative effectiveness/safety data to guide clinician and patient decision making.  
Treatment guidelines emphasize general management principles but fail to provide s pecific 
evidence- based treatment recommendations.4  The lack of consensus about the best treatment 
strategy is confusing and frustrating for clinicians and patients resulting in widespread variation 
in care.13, 14 Moreover, the uncertainty of the situation may be especially stressful for families, 
maki ng it more challenging to meaningfully engage them in the decision making process.   
 
LOW DOSE ORAL METHOTREXATE IN PEDIATRIC CROHN’S DISEASE PATIENTS INITIATING ANTI -TNF 
THERAPY   
 
Version: 10, June 23, 2021  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 5 As a result, t he 2009 Institute of Medicine comparative effectiveness research (CER) report 
identified the introduction of biologics into the treatment algorithm for CD a nd other inflammatory 
diseases  as a top quartile research priority,15 a recommendation subsequently endorsed by the 
American Gastroenterological Association.16  Additional reports from t he Agency for Healthcare 
Research and Quality (AHRQ)4 17 and the Crohn’s and Colitis Foundation of America (CCFA),18 
the leading IBD advocacy organization, have also prioritized studies of the pharma cological 
management of CD as a top national priority for CER.  
 
Chief among the research gaps highlighted by the 2014 AHRQ CER Review were “ studies of 
pediatric patients , newly diagnosed populations, and underrepresented non- White patients.”4  
This report highlighted numerous profound limitations to the existing research in PCD: 1) the 
small number of studies, with few participants per study, 2) the limited scope of pediatric 
studies, including no double -blind randomized, controlled trials, and 3) the lack of studies 
directly addressing the safety of children who have longer lifetime exposures to medications .  
The report concluded that “ Comparing Crohn’s disease medications directly using pragmatic 
clinical trials  will help to understand the effectiveness of medications in clinical practice.”  
These gaps in evidence were reinforced by the 2014 AHRQ Future Research Needs Project on 
the Pharmacological Management of CD.17  Using a multi -stakeholder approach to evaluate 
priorities for study populations and research questions, this report concluded that “ Children were 
unanimously considered a high priority for all future research in the field” because: 1) few 
pediatric studies were identified,  2) none of the adult studies that included participants under 
age 18 reported the results for children separa tely, 3) there is a paucity of trials or observational 
studies to provide evidence to guide the most effective and safe treatment for children, and 4) 
there is no existing evidence of the effectiveness of these medications on quality of life or other 
PROs reported by children or their parents.  
 
The Future Research Needs Project also identified the following question as the highest 
research priority: “For maintenance of remission in adults and children diagnosed with Crohn's 
disease, what is the comparative effectiveness of a TNF-alpha inhibitor and thiopurine versus a 
TNF-alpha inhibitor alone for the outcomes of steroid reduct ion, PROs , Crohn’s Disease Activity 
Index (CDAI), pediatric CDAI and mucosal healing?”   
 
We will conduct a large, pragmatic clinical  trial to answer the following, closely related,  clinical 
question.  Among anti -TNF naïve patients with PCD initiating anti -TNF therapy, does the 
addition of low dose oral MTX  improve:  1) induction  and maintenance of  long -term ( 1 to 3 
years) steroid -free r emission  and 2) PRO s? We will also evaluate safety outcomes and 
collect serum from tr ial participants to determine whether low dose oral MTX  is effective 
in decreasing anti -TNF antibody formation, an established predictor of loss of response 
to anti -TNF therapy.  
 
To successfully conduct a large, pragmatic clinical trial such as this, effective strategies to 
engage and inform families about study participation will be needed.  There is strong evidence 
that use of educational materials called decision aids leads to patients19 and parents20 that are 
better informed about treatment options.  Recently, a decision aid about clinical trial participation 
led to similar benefits,21 but this approach has not yet been applied in the conduct of pediatric 
clinical trials.  Therefore, we will nest a cluster randomized controlled trial to answer the 
question: Does a  pre-consent discussion enhanced with decision aids, compared to standard

THERAPY   
 
Version: 10, June 23, 2021  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 6 pre-consent discussion, improve parent/patient engagement in decision making by increasing  
parent /patient  knowledge related to trial participation?  
 
1.1.2  A Critical Research Gap 
This trial will address a critical research gap recognized by the scientific community, patients, 
and families.  By conducting this long -term maintenance  study within the ImproveCareNow 
(ICN) Learning Health System, the maximum 3 -year follow -up period (already twice the length 
of typical 52 -week studies) can  be easily extended for many years using real -world data 
collected through the network’s registry .  Additionally, as described in more detail below, we can 
utilize the same infrastructure to accelerate the implementation of our findings into routine 
clinic al practice.  
 
Patient Centeredness  
Choosing to initiate therapy with an anti -TNF biologic is a high- risk/high -reward decision and 
one of the most difficult decisions faced by patients with PCD and their families.19, 20  Anti -TNF 
agents are undoubtedly the most effective medical treatment for PCD, yet this comes with 
significant potential costs: a potential risk of malignancy and other serious side effects, including 
immune suppression and auto -immune problems, such as psoriasis and lupus -like 
manifestations; repeated intravenous infusions or painful injections; and the financial burden 
incurred by families due to high cost.   
 
The already difficult decision of whether to initiate an anti -TNF agent is compounded by the 
decision of whether or not to use combination therapy with a second immunomodulator .  
Despite the demonstrated efficacy of anti -TNF agents, not  all patients achieve remission, and a 
significant proportion of patients who do achieve remission lose that response over time.21  A 
significant factor in the loss of response is the development of antibodies to the anti -TNF agent, 
and prior studies of both azathioprine and MTX  suggest combination therapy reduces the 
likelihood of antibody formation. Thus, t he potential benefits of combination therapy include an 
improved likelihood of response and remission, reduction in antibodies to anti -TNF,  and longer 
maintenance of remission.  The potential risks include a greater risk of malignancy, including 
lethal hepatosplenic T cell lymphoma ( HSTCL ) and additional infectious complications.  
Unfortunately, the relative magnitude of the benefits and risks of each approach has not been 
established in PCD, leading to uncertainty among patients, parents,  and physicians.  
 
Children and their caregivers must balance these complex trade -offs at a time in their life and 
illness when they may be least equipped to do so.  First, this decision must often be made 
quickly, and at a time when a pediatric patient and his/her family are  experiencing deteriorating 
health, debilitating gastrointestinal symptoms, and low emotional reserve (child and parent 
depression and anxiety are common comorbidities).7  Second, this decision is often faced at or 
near the time of diagnosis, when patients and their families are still struggling to adjust to a 
severe, chronic medical condition.   
 
Potential for the study to improve health care and outcomes  
The benefits of low dose oral MTX , in addition to anti -TNF, may be both additive and 
synergistic .  As MTX  is, by itself, an  effective treatment for pediatric and adult CD,22, 23  the 
effects of combination therapy should, at least, be additive.  Emerging data also suggests a 
LOW DOSE ORAL METHOTREXATE IN PEDIATRIC CROHN’S DISEASE PATIENTS INITIATING ANTI -TNF 
THERAPY   
 
Version: 10, June 23, 2021  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 7 synergistic  role.  One mechanism underlying loss of response to anti -TNF agents is the 
development of antibodies against the anti -TNF agent.  Antibody development has been 
associated with lower anti -TNF levels, loss of response,  and recurrence of disease activity.24  
Combination therapy with immunomodul ators  such as MTX  has been associated with  
decreased antibody production and higher anti -TNF levels.25  Additionally, combination therapy 
with immunomodulators  may also have a direct impact on anti -TNF clearance.  
 
The improved efficacy of combination therapy of infliximab with thiopurines, a different class of 
immunomodulatory medication than MTX , has been well -established in adult CD patients  who 
were naïve to both thiopurines and infliximab, based on a 50 week study comparing infliximab 
monotherapy, azathioprine monotherapy, and combination therapy.26  Additionally,  antibodies to 
infliximab were detected in less than 1% of those on combination therapy, compared to 14.6% 
of those assigned monotherapy.  However, combination therapy with thiopurines remains 
controversial in PCD patients due to the safety concerns of HSTCL.   
 
Instead, combination therapy with MTX  as an alternative to thiopurines has become increasingly 
common in the management of PCD, due to a presumed lower malignancy risk. Emerging data 
from rheumatology and gastroenterology studies suggest that combination therapy with MTX  
reduces the immunogenicity of infliximab (and perhaps other anti -TNF agents), resulting in 
decreased antibody development.27  One adult trial of this strategy in adult patients was 
inconclusive.  Feagan et al  completed a 50- week, double- blind, placebo- controlled trial 
comparing MTX  and infliximab to infliximab alone in 126 adult patients with moderate -severe 
CD who also received induction therapy with corticosteroids .28  No differences in the primary or 
secondary outcomes were observed.  However, patients who received MTX  were less likely t o 
develop antibodies to infliximab than those who received infliximab alone (4% versus 20%) and 
had higher median trough levels of infliximab.  This raises the possibility that this study was too 
short to observe differences in outcomes that might develop over time, if antibody development 
translates into loss of response.  A number of other limitations of this study have also been 
noted.45 
 
A recent observational study in PCD adds further support to the potential for MTX  to augment 
response to anti -TNF.  A mong patients treated with concomitant MTX , the probability of 
remaining on infliximab therapy for 5 years was 97% versus 58% for patients treated with 
infliximab alone29. 
 
No pediatric trials have directly compared anti -TNF monotherapy and combination therapy with 
MTX .  This evidence gap and the potential for immunologic and pharmacokinetic differences in 
pediatric and adult patients have led to marked practice v ariation in care for children with PCD.  
For example, we performed a  preliminary analysis  of the Improve Care Now registry and found 
that 66% of PCD patients on anti -TNF therapy were using monotherapy and 34% were using 
combination therapy (18% with MTX  and 16% with 6MP/azathioprine). This demonstration of 
clinical equipoise indicates that a pediatric trial of anti -TNF combination versus 
monotherapy is an urgent and unmet need.    
 
In this trial, we have chosen to evaluate low dose oral MTX .  The rationale f or utilizing MTX  over 
thiopurines is that physicians are more comfortable with the safety profile of MTX .  In contrast, 
while thiopurines used in combination anti -TNF are highly effective treatment for CD, this 
regimen has been associated with very rare cases of HSTCL, particularly in young males. The

Version: 10, June 23, 2021  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 8 dosage and route  of MTX  were selected to minimize the known dose -dependent risks of MTX  
(e.g. nausea, liver toxicity)  and the discomfort of subcutaneous injections .  The bioavailability of 
oral MTX  in PCD patients has been previously established30, and combination therapy with low -
dose oral MTX  is commonly utilized in the care of pediatric IBD patients . 
1.1.3  Study Setting  
We anticipate that most study centers will be  members of the ICN  network, as described below.  
Selected additional high- volume pediatric IBD centers will also be invited to participate.  
 
ImproveCareNow  is a learning health system31 that was built with support from AHRQ 
Enhanced Regist ries grants (R01HS20024 and R01HS22974), an NIH Transformative 
Resear ch grant (DK085719), and a Patient Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI)  
patient powered research network ( PPRN ) infrastructure grant.  The purpose of ICN  is to 
transform  the health, care and costs for all children and adolescents with CD and ulcerative 
colitis by building a sustainable collaborative chronic care network  that enables patients, 
families, clinicians and researchers to work together to accelerate innovation, discovery and 
application of new knowledge32.  ICN has made significant strides in developing the social, 
scientific, and technological infrastructure to radically alter how patients and clinicians engage in 
every aspect of a learning health system.  Well -developed processes and tools enable patients, 
families, clinicians and researchers to work together to improve care, identify gaps in outcomes, 
and prioritize research studies (i ncluding this proposal) when there is uncertainty about the best 
management practices.  Once new knowledge is generated through research, quality 
improvement (QI) methods (e.g., decision support, pre- visit planning and transparent quality 
measurement) and interventions to support patient self -management can be utilized to rapidly 
disseminate and implement that knowledge into practice.  
   
Use of structured QI methods to improve care and facilitate research.  ICN uses collaborative 
learning methods based on the IHI Breakthrough Series33 and methods of commons -based peer 
production34 to enable ongoing contribution from patients, families,  clinicians and researchers to 
improve care and outcomes and facilitate research.  Network Learning Sessions are held twice 
each year and provide opportunities for clinical teams, patients, and parents to come together to 
review network performance data, s hare best practices, learn new QI skills, and set goals.  
Between Learning Sessions, care teams, patients and parents share and learn from one 
another through monthly webinars, an active listserv, and an online forum 
(www.improvecarenowexchange.org ) for sharing knowledge and tools.  The network is 
organized in a node structure in which teams are clustered into “Learning Labs” comprised of 8 -
10 teams with similar attributes (e.g., experience, geography, practice siz e).  Each Learning Lab 
is assigned a QI coach who is responsible for coordinating efforts between and within Learning 
Labs.  All QI efforts are based on the Model for Improvement35: setting aims, establishing 
measures, and performing iterative cycles of identifying, testing, implementing, and spreading 
changes that result in improved care and outcomes.  
 
To promote the reliable implementation of chronic care processes, the Network uses QI 
methods and a patient registry.  Specific activities include clinical performance measurement 
and reporting, pre- visit planning and decision support, and population management.  Additional 
and engaging patients and families in shared decision making.  Since 2007, as a result these 
and other processes, the proportion of patients in remission (with inactive disease) has 
increased from 55% to 79%36.

THERAPY   
 
Version: 10, June 23, 2021  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 9  
Data collection/Registry  In 2007,  ICN established a standardized, web- based clinical registry 
that enabled collection of standardized, IBD -specific data about processes and outcomes of 
care (e.g., disease characteristics, patient well -being, laboratory results, and medications).  In 
2010,  with AHRQ funding, ICN developed a modular, open- source, registry that can be linked to 
an electronic health record ( EHR) to minimize the burden of manual data entry. This allows for a 
significant portion of registry data to be transferred electronically via a secure web portal to the 
registry, and stored for re- use in QI, chronic care delivery, and CER.  
 
Data captured through EHR -linkage or web- based forms consist of discrete elements that 
conform to a standardized data model.  Importantly, the primary and many secondary outcomes 
of this trial are routinely collected in the Registry , including the Short Pediatric Crohn’s Disease 
Activity Index (SPCDAI) , Physician Global Assessment, hospitalizations, surgeries, and other 
clinical measures.   
 
MIGRATION OF D ATA TO A THIRD- PARTY HOSTING VENDOR  – The COMBINE database 
will transition from the original registry (hosted by CCHMC), to a new registry hosted by a third 
party. We expect the new registry to be operational for data entry in July 2021, and for all 
migrat ion of data from the old registry to be completed by December 2021. All of the data 
previously collected in the C OMBINE  database will be migrated into the third party database. If 
a patient was included in the registry but is no longer a patient at the cen ter (moved to another 
city, lost to follow- up, etc.), their data will still be migrated, no new data will be collected. The 
only data used for human subjects research will be from patients who have consented for 
research.  
 
1.2 Investigational Agent  
Methotrexat e, which was initially developed in 1948 for the treatment of leukemia, has been 
clinically used for nearly 60 years as low and high dose therapy in leukemias, certain 
lymphomas, Wegener’s ’ disease, psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis. In inflammatory bowel  
disease the clinical efficacy has been established for steroid dependent Crohn’s.37 
 
MTX is an analogue of folic acid and of aminopterin, which is also a folic acid antagonist. One of 
the main mechanisms of action is the inhibition of dihydrofolate reductase. This enzyme is 
involved in the de novo  synthetic pathway for purines and pyrimidines. The rat ionale for the use 
of high dose MTX in the treatment of cancer is that the fast proliferating malignant  cells become 
starved of purine and pyrimidine precursors and therefore are not  able to sufficiently maintain 
deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) and ribonucleic acid (RNA ) synthesis leading to a decreased 
proliferation.  
 
In contrast, the underlying anti -inflammatory effect of low -dose MTX in inflammatory  diseases 
such as rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis and inflammatory bowel diseases is less  clear, sinc e the 
anti-proliferative activity of low- dose MTX is minimal. Multiple  mechanisms of actions are 
proposed including promotion of adenosine release, inhibition of  production of pro -inflammatory 
cytokines, suppression of lymphocyte proliferation,  neutrophil chemotaxis and adherence and 
reduction of serum immunoglobulin’s  38, 39. 
 
LOW DOSE ORAL METHOTREXATE IN PEDIATRIC CROHN’S DISEASE PATIENTS INITIATING ANTI -TNF 
THERAPY   
 
Version: 10, June 23, 2021  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 10 MTX can be administered by oral, subcutaneous, intramuscular or intravenous routes.  Orally, 
MTX is absorbed in the jejunum and good bioavailability is only achieved in doses  below 15 mg. 
Above this threshold absorption rates can vary up to 30%40.  
 
MTX has a relatively short serum half -life of 6 to 8 hours and more than 80% of the drug in its 
intact form is excreted in the urine by glomerular and tubular secretion. Thus, drugs interfer ing 
with renal tubular secretion such as probenecid or the existence of low kidney function result in 
an increase in circulating MTX, which can lead to toxic side effects . Approximately 35% of MTX 
is bound to plasma proteins including albumin. Toxicity can  be observed with concurrent low 
serum albumin concentrations or if MTX is displaced from albumin by drugs such as 
sulfonamides or tetracyclines.  
 
After MTX is taken up by tissues, it is converted to MTX  polyglutamates, whic h are long- lived 
derivates that retain biochemical and biological  activity. The MTX polyglutamates are thought to 
be responsible for most of the anti -inflammatory effects . However, studies in patients with 
Rheumatoid Arthritis ( RA) and IBD have so far not found any meaningful correlation between 
the clinical efficacy of MTX and serum or plasma levels of either intact MTX or its metabolites, 
suggesting that there is little clinical value in monitoring these levels41. 
1.3 Clinical Data to Date  
The effectiveness of intramuscularly administered MTX 25 mg once weekly in steroid dependent 
CD in adults is well documented. In the North American Crohn’s Study Group landmark trial, 
39.4% of the patients rec eiving MTX 25 mg subcutaneously ( sq) / week achieved clinical 
remission, as defined as a CDAI  < 150 points and the discontinuation of prednisone, compared 
to 19.1% of the patients in the placebo group42. Feagan et al. also demonstrated a significant 
efficacy of 15 mg MTX sq once weekly in maintaining steroid free remission in CD patients (after 
40 weeks 65% remission in the MTX group  vs. 39% in the placebo group) 43. 
 
Although there are no placebo- controlled, randomized trials of MTX  for the treatment of  PCD, 
the use of MTX  in this patient population is increasing and the body of published observational  
studies is growing. Mack et al . first reported on 14 patients with a mean age of 10.6 years who 
had active CD and were intolerant or unresponsive to 6MP44. Subcutaneous administration of 
MTX  resulted in  64% of patients  with clinical improvement by as early as 4 weeks. Steroid 
sparing was also demonstrated. Adverse events attributed to MTX  were nausea and headache 
leading to withdrawal of therapy in two patients. No patients demonstrated bone marrow 
suppression, abnormal liver chemistries, or pulmonary complications. A nother single center 
experience demonstrated a 12 -month steroid- free remission rate of about 33% which is similar 
to that seen in reports of adult patients with CD45. Good tolerance of the MTX  therapy was 
reported.  
 
Two multicenter retrospective studies published in 2006 and 2007 demonstrated a 40– 45% 1-
year steroid -free remission rate with MTX  as a second- line immunomodulator in PCD patients46, 
47. No difference in effect was seen whether the indication for the MTX  was lack of thiopurine 
efficacy or intolerance. Again, overall good drug tolerance was demonstrated as were a steroid 
spari ng effect and a positive effect on linear growth46.   
 
More recently, a retrospective cohort study 172 children who received at least 3 months of MTX 
without thi opurine or biologicals and had ≥1 year of follow -up was reported48. Twenty -seven  
percent of those receiving MTX as a first line immunomodulator ( IMM) achieved ≥ 12 months of 
sustained clinical remission without surgery, thiopurine, biologicals, or corticosteroids, as 
LOW DOSE ORAL METHOTREXATE IN PEDIATRIC CROHN’S DISEASE PATIENTS INITIATING ANTI -TNF 
THERAPY   
 
Version: 10, June 23, 2021  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 11 compared with 35% of those receiving MTX as a second line agent (p> 0.05).  Fifteen percent of 
patients devel oped an ALT >60 international units/liter and 12% developed a white blood cell 
<4000 cells per microliter while on MTX. Only 4% of these discontinued MTX completely. A 
recent European multi -center retrospective cohort of 113 children with CD in remission (median 
age 14 years) demonstrated a slightly higher effectiveness of MTX .  In this study, 52% of 
patients remained in steroid-  and biologics -free remission 12 months after starting MTX 
monotherapy49. 
 
There are also emerging pediatric data regarding com bination therapy with anti -TNF biologics 
and MTX .  In a single center experience, PCD patients treated with low -dose  oral MTX (<10 
mg/wk) demonstrated no benefit in terms of infliximab effectiveness or durability as compared to 
children receiving infliximab monotherapy50.  However, Grossi recently reported  a retrospective, 
multicenter cohort study of 81 chil dren receiving combination therapy with infliximab and MTX  
(60 male, 21 female).   Males receiving MTX  for more than 6 months showed a significantly 
greater likelihood of remaining on infliximab throughout the f ollow- up period compared to no 
MTX  or other im munomodulator  or ≤6 months  MTX , with 5 year probabilities ranging from 0 .41 
±0.11 among patients who received no concomitant immunomodulator  to .97±.03 in patients 
treated with  MTX  > 6 months (p< 0.001).   Among females,  the trend was in the same direction.  
Additionally, the durability of infliximab  was significantly greater with MTX  as compared to 
thiopurines ( 97±0.03 vs 0 .58±0.08).  In this study, the investigators were unable to identify an 
optimal dose or route of administration for concomitant  MTX , as nearly all patients continued on 
infliximab regardless of MTX  dose /route29.  
1.4 Dose Rationale and Risk/Benefits  
For this trial, the investigators have decided on a slightly lower dose of MTX  than the 15mg/M2 
given subcutaneously that has been most frequently used in MTX  monotherapy for CD.46  
Specifically, we are utilizing a dose of 10mg/M2 given orally (or to simplify 15  mg for children ≥ 
40kg, 12.5 mg  for children 30  to <40 kg, and 10 mg for children 20  to <30 kg ).  The rationale for 
this dosage is as follows.  First,  we believe the dose should be higher than 10 mg (for large size 
children), as one pediatric study sugges ted no benefit to doses less than 10 mg, and a second 
study failed to detect a threshold effect.  As dose- dependent AEs with MTX  are common, and 
include nausea, leukopenia, elevated liver function, and mouth sores, we plan to utilize a lower 
dose than the 25mg adult induction dose.  We anticipate this will improve patient recruitment, 
tolerability, compliance, and long term retention of study subjects  as well as reduce the 
frequency and severity of expected adverse reactions .  Therefore, we have selected a dose of 
15mg (in larger children) as this is the recommended maintenance for monotherapy in adult 
patients.  We have scaled the dose downwards, based on weight, as described above.  
 
We have selected oral administration, based upon pediatric  data suggesting that oral 
bioavailability  is comparable to that of subcutaneous administration, particularly at lower doses , 
and the oral formulation should substantially increase acceptability by  patients and their 
guardians.  
 
1.5 Standard versus Enhanced Consent  
A nested s tudy was conducted as part of this study to determine if an enhanced consent 
process was well received and assisted participants with understanding of the study better than 
a standard consent process.

THERAPY   
 
Version: 10, June 23, 2021  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 12 As part of the enhanced consent process, select sites  received materials to assist with the 
consent discussion that included pictures and plain language texts. Potential participants were 
randomized to the use of these enhanced materials or to a standardly accepted research 
consent process.  
 
Data regarding the use of the enhanced consent materials was found to be null. While 
participants shared an appreciation for the materials, there was no indication the materials alone 
assisted with the participants’ knowledge of the study.  
 
Materials will be made availab le to all sites participating in this study to be used as an optional 
consenting aid.  
 
 
 
2 Study Objectives  
2.1 Primary Objective  
• To determine whether, in children with CD initiating anti -TNF biological therapy  with 
infliximab or adalimumab, low- dose oral MTX  is more effective than placebo in the 
induction and subsequent maintenance of steroid- free remission for a treatment period 
of up to three  years.  We hypothesize that the addition of MTX  to anti -TNF therapy will 
be more effective than placebo (i.e. anti -TNF monotherapy).   
2.2 Secondary Objectives 
• To determine whether, in children with CD initiating anti -TNF biological therapy  with 
infliximab or adalimumab, low- dose oral MTX  leads to be tter PROs  as compared to 
placebo.  We hypothesize that the addition of MTX  to anti-TNF therapy will result in 
better PROs than placebo (i.e. anti -TNF monotherapy).   
• To determine whether low -dose oral methotrexate, in combination with anti -TNF 
biological therapy, is more effective than anti -TNF monotherapy in reducing anti -TNF 
antibody formation resulting in higher anti -TNF trough levels.    
 
2.3 Additional  Objectives  
• To describe the investigator -reported AEs (Grade 2 or higher1) in PCD patients initiating 
anti-TNF, treated with low dose o ral MTX and in a placebo comparison group.  
• To create a registry to hold and make data  and biosamples  about patients initiating anti -
TNF therapy to be used in future QI and research endeavors to generate new 
knowledge and/or improve care for patients.  
 
 
3 Study Design 
3.1 General Design  
We will conduct a placebo- controlled, double blind, pragmatic, multi -site randomized clinical trial 
to determine whether, in children with CD initiating anti -TNF biological therapy, low -dose oral 
LOW DOSE ORAL METHOTREXATE IN PEDIATRIC CROHN’S DISEASE PATIENTS INITIATING ANTI -TNF 
THERAPY   
 
Version: 10, June 23, 2021  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 13 MTX  is more effective than placebo in the induction and subsequent maintenance of steroid- free 
remission .  We will use randomization  within each site , stratified by anti -TNF agent used 
(infliximab or adalimumab), to ensure balanced treatment allocati on within individual sites. A 
randomized, double- blind trial is necessary to control for measured and unmeasured 
confounders, as well as potential biases that could impact the assessment of study outcomes.   
 
 
 
 
 
Registry data sharing for Research  
 
Resear ch that address the objectives  listed in section 2 will be performed without additional 
protocols and/or IRB review using the data analysis outlined in section 8.  
 
Data and samples housed within the database and repository may be used for research 
activit ies as an ongoing effort to generate new knowledge and/or improve the care of patients at 
participating sites. Participating Investigators may request data and/or specimens for research 
activities of the existing samples and data without an additional IRB application, review, and 
approval. All retrospective use of data and/or samples under a limited data set will meet the 
ongoing approval status of this overall project . A listing of these projects and the data and/or 
specimens provided will be documented in this project file for reference, if needed.  
 
If a participating Investigator proposes a research project that will require collecting data 
prospectively and/or with the need to contact database patients, an IRB approved protocol with 
IRB approval letter must be submitted for review to a member of the regulatory team. Once 
these documents are reviewed, approval to release the requested data and/or specimens to the 
Investigator will be shared with the data management team. A listing of these projects and the 
data and/or samples provided will be documented in this project file for reference, if needed.  
 
Linkage of Participant Data to Visits  
 
LOW DOSE ORAL METHOTREXATE IN PEDIATRIC CROHN’S DISEASE PATIENTS INITIATING ANTI -TNF 
THERAPY   
 
Version: 10, June 23, 2021  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 14 The COMBINE  database will have the ability for a direct linkage to participating site’s electronic 
medical record. Sit es that opt to have a direct linkage wi ll be responsible for ensuring all data 
elements are transferred into the COMBINE  database by spot checking data elements. Manual 
entry of non- electronic medical record data, such as questionnaires, etc. will be requi red by the 
site’s study team. COMBINE  and the care center are responsible for ensuring proper 
agreements and protections are in place for this direct linkage.  
 
Recruitment and Enrollment into Future Studies 
 
The individuals included in the COMBINE  database may be contacted for future research 
studies. These studies may originate from participating Investigators, participating sites, non-
profit organizations, or for -profit organizations. All requests for patient listings must include a 
synopsis of the planned research study and a clear definition of inclusion/exc lusion criteria. 
Once these are reviewed by the data management team, the patient listing and contact 
information will be shared with the requesting individual or organization. A listing of these 
requests and the data provided will be doc umented in this pr oject file for reference, if needed.   
 
 
3.2 Primary Study Endpoints  
Primary Outcome - Induction and maintenance of steroid- free remission  for up to 3 years .  
This will be analyzed as time to first treatment failure, as defined by occurrence of any of the 
following:  
• Failure to achieve remission ( SPCDAI  < 15) by  the week 26 visit . 
• If initiating the study on steroids  for IBD reasons , failure to complete a steroid taper by week 
16. 
• SPCDAI  ≥ 15, attributed to active Crohn’s disease,  at two or more consecutive visits  beyond 
the week 26 visit . Elevated SPCDAI ( ≥ 15 ) due to a non -IBD reason ( i.e. infection, IBS, 
normal colonoscopy or other test of mucosal inflammation)  does not count toward this 
outcome.  
• Hospitalization for active IBD or abdominal surgery  after week 25 . 
• Use of oral prednisone or  prednisolone, enteral release budesonide, or intravenous ( IV) 
methylprednisolone for a period of over 10 weeks  cumulatively , beyond week 16.  Note, thi s 
does not include use of steroid as a premedication for anti -TNF administration  or steroids 
used for conditions other than CD (e.g. asthma, poison ivy, etc.) . 
• Discontinuation of the anti -TNF agent and/or study drug for lack of effectiveness or toxicity.  
 
Switching from the biologic originator to a biosimilar or vice  versa does not constitute 
discontinuation of the anti -TNF.  
 
Discontinuation of anti -TNF in the setting of treatment de- escalation will not be considered as a 
treatment failure.   Neither will d iscontinuation of the anti -TNF or study medication for non -
medical reasons (i.e. desire to switch to an alternative therapy).  
 
LOW DOSE ORAL METHOTREXATE IN PEDIATRIC CROHN’S DISEASE PATIENTS INITIATING ANTI -TNF 
THERAPY   
 
Version: 10, June 23, 2021  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 15 NOTE:  Any patient who meets a primary study endpoint as described above, or who 
discontinues their first -line anti -TNF for CD for  any reason, must discontinue study medications. 
Please see section 4.4.  
3.3 Secondary Study Endpoints  
There are three secondary study endpoints:  
 
1. Mean Patient Reported Outcome  Measurement and Information System  (PROMIS ) Pain 
Interference T score by treatment arm.  We will compare the mean of PROMIS Pain 
Interference T scores at week 52 and week 104 between the treatment groups.  
 
2. Mean PROMIS Fatigue T score by treatment arm. We will compare the mean of 
PROMIS Fatigue T scores at week 52 and week 104 between the treatment groups.  
 
Proportion of patients with positive anti -TNF antibody status based on the sample collected in 
the second year (week 91). If a sample is not collected in the second year, the sample collected 
in the first year will be used (week 14).  
3.4 Tertiary Endpoints  
Indirect and direct markers of disease activity and mucosal inflammation and healing.   Objective 
and firm endpoints are increasingly recognized as important outcomes of explanatory trials in 
CD, including clinical efficacy studies designed for FDA approval.  These include routine 
laboratory assessments including erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C reactive protein 
(CRP), albumin, and hemoglobin.   
 
There are many additional tests  for which there is ongoing debate regarding routine clinic al use 
due to their high cost and/or invasive nature [calprotectin (biomarker of intestinal inflammation) 
and endoscopy )].  Given the pragmatic nature of this trial, we will not mandate the use of such  
tests by study protocol.  Rather, we will collect thes e test results if/when they are performed in 
the context of each patient’s routine clinical care.  We will educate clinicians on one endoscopic 
scoring system commonly utilized to assess disease activity in clinical studies, the Simple 
Endoscopic Sc ore for  Crohn's Disease (SES -CD), so that they may more accurately report their 
endoscopic findings.  As we anticipate that  routine use of such  testing to assess mucosal 
healing will increase over the next several years, this will minimize  the potential for differential 
testing based on patient clinical status.   
 
Change in anti -TNF dose or interval .  The anti -TNF dose may be changed at the discretion of 
the treating provider.  Changes in anti -TNF dosing will be recorded, as will the reason for these 
changes, and this will be analyzed as pre -specified endpoints.   
 
Other endpoints to be analyzed include anti -TNF trough levels, induction of remission, 
maintenance of remission, and height velocity Z scores. We will assess induction of remission 
through the week 26 visit (window 22 -30 weeks) . Maintenance of remission will be assessed at 
time points following the confirmation of successful induction.  
3.5 Safety Endpoints  
The major safety concerns for PCD patients undergoing treatment with anti -TNF biologics (with 
or without  combination therapy) include the risk of  opportunistic  infections and malignancy.  
LOW DOSE ORAL METHOTREXATE IN PEDIATRIC CROHN’S DISEASE PATIENTS INITIATING ANTI -TNF 
THERAPY   
 
Version: 10, June 23, 2021  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 16 Safety concerns with MTX  include bone marrow suppression, hepatotoxicity, nausea, and hair 
loss.  Although this trial is designed primarily for CER rather than safety, we w ill monitor AEs 
regularly and  we will work with a Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) to  conduct interim 
analyses to detect any adverse safety signals.  Many of the safety concerns, including 
malignancy, are primarily long- term considerations that are beyond the duration of most clinical 
trials , and are better assessed from registries involving thousands of patients .  However, a key 
strength of conducting this study in the context of ICN is that long- term safety data will continue 
to be collected by the net work and accumulate following the conclusion of the funded trial itself .  
Hence, this trial will lay the groundwork for long- term safety studies . 
 
3.6 Endpoints for Trial of Enhanced vs. Standard Pre- Consent Discussion  
The primary outcome is the percentage cor rect on parent/patient knowledge items related to 
trial participation.  The secondary outcome is the percentage of parents/patients who agree to 
enroll in the pragmatic clinical trial.   
 
4 Subject Selection and Withdrawal  
4.1 Inclusion Criteria

standard clinical criteria (radiography, endoscopy, histology)  
2) Less than  21 years of age 
3) Greater than or equal to 20 kg in weight  
4) Initiating anti -TNF therapy with infliximab or adalimumab (including biosimilars) .  
Although the decision to start anti -TNF is at the discretion of the treating physician rather 
than by protocol, standard of care in pediatric Crohn’s includes ensuring that the patient 
has active inflammation (generally through ass essment of blood work, imaging, 
endoscopy/colonoscopy, fecal calprotectin, etc.) as the cause of his/her symptoms, 
rather than infection (viral, C. difficile , other), Irritable Bowel Syndrome, or complication 
of CD such as stricture or abscess.   
5) Ability t o provide parental permission  and child assent (where applicable) , or adult 
consent for patients ages 18- 20 
4.2 Exclusion Criteria  
1) Prior use of anti -TNF therapy  for CD 
2) Lack of stable home address that study medications can be mailed to  
3) Anticipated short length of follow up at study center (plans for family to move, transition 
to adult GI  (gastrointestinal) provider , etc.).  Patients expected to leave practice < 12  
months from enrollment should not be enrolled.  
4) Concurrent abdominal or pelvic abscess. A recent hi story of abdominal or pelvic 
abscess, which is controlled,  does not exclude the subject.  
5) Prior intra -abdominal surgery without a clinically significant relapse (i.e. patients starting 
on anti -TNF for post -op prophylaxis or for endoscopic recurrence only should not be 
included)

Those with a recent history of colonic adenoma or dysplastic lesions should be 
excluded.  
12) Known high alcohol consumption (more than seven drinks per week)  
13) Patients with serum albumin < 2.5 g/dl

4.3 Subject Pre-screening and Recruitment  
Participant identification  and pre -screening.  Potential sub jects will be identified through the 
standardized pre- visit planning process.  Care teams (physicians, nurses, study coordinators, 
etc.) use the process to anticipate patient needs and pre -arrange/coordinate services.  Pre- visit 
planning also includes a review of research studies a patient may be eligible for (or enrolled in).  
This allows necessary staff to have recruitment or study visit materials available at the time of 
the encounter.  
A limited waiver of HIPAA is  necessary to pre -screen patient’s medic al record / EHR data to 
look for indications that a patient may be heading tow ard anti -TNF therapy initiation (i.e. recent 
negative trends in sPCDAI, lab values, imaging, and endoscopic  assessments) as well as to 
review past medical history for other inclusion and exclusion criteria.

THERAPY   
 
Version: 10, June 23, 2021  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 18 Recruitment.  All potential patients / parents identified during pre- screening, who are approached 
for the trial , will take part in a  pre-consent discussion that introduces the study using IRB 
approved recruitment materials.  
 
In addition to asking questions  of study investigators and research coordinators, potential 
patients / parents who are approached for the trial  will be given the opportunity to connect with 
Resource Parents –  parents of current study participants –  to lear n about what it is like to 
participate in this research study. The process for the identification, training, and coordination of 
Resource Parents will be detailed separately and will include procedures for maintaining patient 
confidentiality.  
 
Informed consent . In order to inform overall trial recruitment efforts, we will attempt to collect a 
reason from those who decline to participate / sign a consent form. For those who decide to 
participate, informed consent (and assent where applicable) will be obtain ed prior to initiation of 
any clinical screening procedures that are performed solely for the purpose of determining 
eligibility for this study . All sites will have access to materials for an enhanced consent process. 
The use of these materials for each si te is optional.  
 
4.4 Discontinuation of Study Medication  
Dose discontinuation:  Any patient who meets a primary study endpoint or who discontinues their 
first-line anti -TNF for CD for any other reason, must discontinue study medications. Upon 
request, t he treat ing physician will be unbli nded if there is a clear case that knowledge of that 
patient’s treatment assignment would impact  future treatment decisions.  
   
In the event of medical emergencies that require immediate unblinding, treating physicians will 
have access to a 24-hour pager . Patients who experience Serious Adverse Events or abnormal 
laboratory values  may also discontinue study treatment  based on assessment by the Safety 
Medical Monitor and/or a local site investigator .   
 
Patients who become pregnant over the course of the study will also discontinue study 
treatment.    
 
At any point in time, the clinician/investigator and/or the patient /caregiver  may choose to 
discontinue study treatments  for any reason .  Reasons may include poor study follow -up, 
change of mind, logistics, etc.  
 
See section 6.9  for procedures related to discontinuation of study medication.  
  
Patient Follow -up: Patients discontinuing study treatment  will continue to be followed for up to 3 
years  unless consent is withdrawn for  the rem aining study procedures , or they have met a 
primary study endpoint. If the patient has met an endpoint, the follow -up period will be for a 
maximum of two years.  See section 6 .9 for details related to follow -up of patient off study 
medication. The subsequent treatments and outcomes of these patients will be utilized in 
secondary analyses.  
4.5 Early Withdrawal of Subjects  
Early Termination:  Patients/caregivers may also withdraw consent.  The term “withdrew consent” 
means that the patient/family chooses to fully  discontinue participation in the trial. This includes 
discontinuation of study treatment and all other IRB -approved research activities (including use 
LOW DOSE ORAL METHOTREXATE IN PEDIATRIC CROHN’S DISEASE PATIENTS INITIATING ANTI -TNF 
THERAPY   
 
Version: 10, June 23, 2021  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 19 of routine follow -up visit information for trial purposes) . Efforts should be made to collect study 
data up to the date of withdrawal and to make a follow -up plan for any ongoing adverse events 
or pregnancy. P atients at ICN study centers will continue to have routine clinical data collected 
through the ImproveCareNow Registry , but will not undergo any additional follow- up or data 
collection that is specific for this trial.  Subjects who withdraw after shipment of study 
medications  will not be replaced by recruitment of additional subjects.  
 
5 Study Drug  
5.1 Description  
Methotrexate (MTX), which was initially develope d in 1948 for the treatment of leukemia, has 
been clinically used for nearly 60 years as low and high dose therapy in leukemias, certain 
lymphomas, Wegener’s ’ disease, psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis. In inflammatory bowel 
disease the clinical efficacy has been established for steroid dependent Crohn’s.  
 
MTX is an analogue of folic acid and of aminopterin, which is also a folic acid antagonist. One of 
the main mechanisms of action is the inhibition of dihydrofolate reductase. This enzyme is 
involved in t he de novo synthetic pathway for purines and pyrimidines.  
 
Although there are no placebo- controlled, randomized trials of MTX for the treatment of pediatric 
CD, the use of MTX in this patient population is increasing and the body of published 
observational studies is growing.  Oral MTX is absorbed in the jejunum and good bioavailability 
is achieved in doses below 15 mg.  
 
Our study will utilize MTX  2.5mg pills or matching placebo.   
5.2 Treatment R egimen  
1) Oral MTX  or placebo:  The weekly dose will be 15 mg for c hildren ≥ 40kg, 12.5 mg  for 
children 30 to <40 kg, and 10 mg for children 20  to <30 kg.   
2) Ondansetron or placebo: A twice per week , 4mg dose of ondansetron for the MTX  group 
(or matching placebo for the placebo group) will be provided as pre- treatment to prevent 
nausea.  The first dose of ondansetron or placebo should be taken one hour before the 
weekly dose of MTX or placebo. The second dose should be taken the morning after the 
weekly dose of methotrexate or placebo. In consultation with the provider, the patient 
may skip the second dose of ondansetron or placebo. *The study provider may opt -out 
of the provision of this component of the study treatment based on clinical judgement. 
See below.  
3) A 1 mg dose of folic acid per day for all patients (those receiving MTX or placebo)  will be 
provided. This will help to reduce the risk of side effects in the MTX  group.  
 
Table 1: Treatment Regimen  Summary  
Arm 1  Arm 2  
MTX  (10, 12.5, or 15 mg, once weekly)  Placebo  (once weekly)  
Ondansetron  (4 mg, twice  weekly)  Placebo  (twice  weekly)  
Folic Acid  (1 mg, daily)  Folic Acid  (1 mg, daily)  
 
LOW DOSE ORAL METHOTREXATE IN PEDIATRIC CROHN’S DISEASE PATIENTS INITIATING ANTI -TNF 
THERAPY   
 
Version: 10, June 23, 2021  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 20 In special circumstances, the study medications may be dissolved and administered orally or by 
gastrostomy  tube (G-tube) . Instructions will be provided for dissolving the methotrexate / 
placebo in a closed system.  
 
As nausea may be a symptom of CD (even in the absence of MTX ), all patients should be given 
a prescription by their treating physician for an age based dose of ondansetron to be used on an 
as needed (PRN)  basis , as is consistent with standard of care (4mg  for patients < 12 years of 
age; 4 or 8mg for patients 12 years of age and older).  Note that for patients who receive 
ondansetron as a study medication and as a PRN prescribed by their physician, the maximum 
dose of 16mg will not  be exceeded.   The prescription of ondansetron by each patient’s 
physician will be in accordance with best clinical practices.   As ondansetron has been reported 
to very rarely cause cardiac arrhythmias in patients with prolonged QT syndrome or medications  
that prolong the QT interval, clinicians will be educated about not utilizing ondansetron in these 
populations.  Of note, o ral ondansetron utilized in a single dose has not been reported to cause 
cardiac arrhythmias.   
 
Ondansetron / placebo Opt –Out. Because nausea is a common side effect of methotrexate, 
ondansetron is included as part of the treatment regimen to help protect the blind. The study 
provider  may opt -out of sending the ondansetron / placebo portion of the study treatment  
regimen and may prescr ibe another anti -emetic per routine clinical care.  The decision to opt -out 
will incorporate clinical judgement in regard to patient  safety and maintenance of the blind.  
 
Folic Acid.  At their discretion, the study provider may advise patients  not to take folic acid on 
days where methotrexate / placebo is taken, according to their usual practice.   
 
Anti-TNF.  Since the decision to start anti -TNF is at the discretion of the treating physician,  all 
patients will have the anti -TNF agent (infliximab or adalimumab)  prescribed and dose adjusted 
according to their physician’s usual practice, not a pre- specified study protocol.  Selection of 
anti-TNF agent is at the discretion of the treating physician.  Standard best practice guidance 
will be provided to all participat ing physicians, including 1) the  identification of appropriate 
patients to start on anti -TNF, and 2) appropriate screening for tuberculosis and other infections 
prior to starting anti -TNF.  
 
As described below, the patient should be randomized to study trea tment as close to the start of 
anti-TNF as possible, but no more than  42 days  (before or after) the initiation of anti -TNF. 
 
Treatment will continue for up to 3 years . 
5.3 Method for Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups  
Participants will be randomized to one of the two treatment arms with a 1:1 allocation ratio. We 
will utilize a centralized, stratified, randomization approach in which randomization in each 
stratum will occur in a constrained block with maximum imbalance of 3. We will stratify within 
sites and by anti -TNF agent prescribed (infliximab or adalimumab).  
5.4 Packaging 
MTX  and matching placebo tablets will be packaged in 1-Clic Clear Vu 40 -dram prescription 
vials. Vials are USP 671 compliant (light, moisture, and child resistance) and contain an audible  
click enclosure to ensure the vials are properly secured.   Each shipment  will contain enough 
tablets for 13 doses and vials will be labeled with clear instructions for how many tablets to take 
at each dosing day (once weekly).

Ondansetron and matching pl acebo tablets will be packaged in 1 -Clic Clear Vu 40 -dram 
prescription vials. Vials are USP 671 compliant (light, moisture, and child resistance) and 
contain an audible click enclosure to ensure the vials are properly secured.   Each shipment  will 
contain enough tablets for 13 twice -weekly doses and vials will be labeled with clear instructions 
for how many tablets to take at each dosing day ( one hour before MTX/placebo and the morning 
after the weekly MTX/ placebo dose ). In consultation with the provider, th e patient may skip the 
second dose of ondansetron or placebo.  
 
Folic acid 1mg tablets will be packaged in 1 -Clic Clear Vu 40 -dram prescription vials. Vials are 
USP 671 compliant (light, moisture, and child resistance) and contain an audible click enclosure  
to ensure the vials are properly secured.  Each shipment  will contain enough tablets for 13 
weeks of daily dosing, with instructions to take one tablet by mouth once daily.  
 
Patient -specific supplies  will be packaged together in a box kit,  which will be s hipped to the 
participant.  Additional instructions will be included with the kit , detailing the entire regimen and 
when each of the three medications should be taken.  A 7-day pill box will be provided to assist 
with proper dosing.  
 
5.5 Blinding of Study Drug  
For MTX , a commercial 2.5mg tablet will be purchased in bulk and repackaged into smaller 
bottles as described above, at the time of dispensing.  Similar -appearing placebo tablets, 
consisting of microcrystalline cellulose and binding and coloring agents, wi ll be manufactured by 
the cGMP  (current Good Manufacturing Practices)  Laboratory at the Temple University School 
of Pharmacy, using a tableting die plate made to create tablets with the same size/shape and 
similar markings to the original MTX  tablet.  Thos e placebo tablets will also be repackaged into 
smaller bottles as described above, at the time of dispensing.  
 
For ondansetron, a commercial 4mg tablet will be purchased in bulk and repackaged into 
smaller bottles as described above, at the time of dispens ing.  Similar -appearing placebo 
tablets, consisting of microcrystalline cellulose and binding and coloring agents, will be 
manufactured by the cGMP Laboratory at the Temple University School of Pharmacy, using a 
tableting die plate made to create tablets w ith the same size/shape and similar markings to the 
original ondansetron  tablet.  Those placebo tablets will also be repackaged into smaller bottles 
as described above, at the time of dispensing.  
 
For folic acid, commercial 1mg tablets will be purchased in  bulk bottles of 500 or 1,000 tablets 
and will be repackaged into smaller bottles as described above, at the time of dispensing.  
5.6 Receiving, Dispensing, Storage and Return  
5.6.1  Receipt of Drug Supplies  
The central  pharmacy  will purchase the three commercial medications either through 
pharmaceutical wholesalers or directly from the manufacturers.  These products will remain in 
their original manufacturers’ containers prior to repackaging for individual subjects.  Placebo 
manufactured by the Temple University School of Pharmacy, will be shipped to the central 
pharmacy  in bulk.  Perpetual inventories will be maintained by the central pharmacy  using a 21  
CFR (Code of Federal Regulations) Part 11 compliant electronic drug accountability system.  
LOW DOSE ORAL METHOTREXATE IN PEDIATRIC CROHN’S DISEASE PATIENTS INITIATING ANTI -TNF 
THERAPY   
 
Version: 10, June 23, 2021  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 22 5.6.2  Storage  
Both active and placebo tablets, will be stored in an investigational drug storeroom at the central 
pharmacy , under tight security (research pharmacy staff only) and controlled room temperature  
conditions (20 -25 Cels ius). 
5.6.3  Dispensing of Study Drug 
As this is a pragmatic clinical trial, it is important that participating practices are not required to 
have an on -site research pharmacy.  Additionally, we do not want dispensing of study drugs to 
interrupt routine clinical practice.  Therefore, upon randomization, the  central pharmacy  will 
distribute study drugs by mail to each participant’s home.  
 
Enrollment and randomization of a subject at the clinical site, will trigger an alert from the data 
management system, to the central pharmacy , that a treatment kit is needed, along with the 
treatment condition, dosing information (and weight for the pharmacist to confirm this with) and 
the subject’s and parent’s contact information so that the product can be shipped.  Prior to the 
initial shipment of study medication, t he pharmacist will contact the subject (or parent) to confirm 
the subject’s information and provide counselling according to a script. Any discrepancies or 
inconsistencies discovered during the call will be resolved with the clinical site prior to 
processing the initial  shipment. The bottles will be filled by a research technician and labeled, 
then checked by a licensed pharmacist before the box kit is sealed and sent to the subject.  The 
pharmacy will track the package until receipt by the intended recipient and will notify the 
sponsor of any problems. The site study coordinator will be able to access shipment details via 
a report within the trial electronic data capture system.  
 
Each drug kit will contain a 3 -month  supply of medication.  Refills will also be provided by  the 
central pharmacy according to the study dosing schedule.  All drug kits will contain dosing 
instructions.   
 
Following each shipment, a physician, nurse, or study coordinator  will contact the patient /parent  
to ensure they received the drug kit  in good condition, review dosing instructions, and answer 
any questions.  The date the patient began study drug will be recorded.  
5.6.4  Return or Destruction of Study Drug and Subject Compliance Monitoring  
Any u nused study medication will be returned to the clinical sit e and given to the study team at 
the next regularly scheduled visit after a new kit is received, or upon completion of the treatment 
phase of the trial.  The site study team will document compliance by counting the quantity of 
tablets unused when the bottl es were returned.  Once quantities are documented in the 
electronic CRF  (eCRF) , the study medication may be destroyed in biohazard waste following 
the site’s policies for investigational drug destruction.  For sites that do not have a suitable 
method of destruction, arrangements may be made on an individual site basis, to return product 
to the central pharmacy  for incineration.  
 
If a subject forgets or is unable to bring pills to the clinic appointment, reasonable efforts will be 
made to collect study medic ation at a later date.  However, if after reasonable effort the 
coordinator is not able to collect remaining pills or verify that no pills remain, this will be 
documented in the case report form ( CRF). 
 
All anal yses will be conducted using an intent to tre at basis, without regards to compliance.

THERAPY   
 
Version: 10, June 23, 2021  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 23 5.7 Prior and Concomitant Therapy  
Prior and current use of other immune suppressant medications for the treatment of IBD will be 
recorded.   Current use of all medications will also be recorded.  This includes prednisone, 
methylprednisolone, 6MP, azathioprine, MTX , cyclosporine,  and tacrolimus.  
 
• Prior use of anti -TNF therapy for Crohn’s disease will not be allowed  (i.e. prior use of anti -
TNF f or other conditions, such as juvenile idiopathic arthritis , is allowable).  
• Patients receiving 6MP, azathioprine, or MTX  must discontinue treatment with these agents 
at the time of or prior to randomization.   No specific wash -out period will be required.  
• Patients treated with prednisone, methylprednisolone, or other systemic steroids  or with 
budesonide at the time of randomization, must be initiated on a taper of these agents.  The 
taper will be at the discretion of the treating physician.  Failure to discontinue steroids by 
week 16 will be considered a treatment failure.  These patients will discontinue treatment 
with study drugs.  
• The following drug groups are not permitted as concomitant medication:  
o Other immune suppressants such as cyclosporine, tacrolimus, mycophenolate 
mofetil, etc.  
o Other biologic agents such as vedolizumab, usteki numab, etc.  
• No live vaccines should be administered during the trial  
• If during the study a patient needs to be started on a medication that has a potential 
interaction with MTX  (e.g. Probenecid, Acitret in, Streptozocin, nitrous oxide anesthesia ), the 
site investigator should contact the Principal Investigator, Dr. Michael Kappelman, to discuss 
whether the patient should continue in the study.  
• Use caution when administering methotrexate after a recent history of nitrous oxide 
administration as it may result in potential increased toxicity (i.e. stomatitis, 
myelosuppression, and neurotoxicity).  
 
Consistent with pragmatic clinical trial design, concomitant medications not specifically excluded 
above will be allowed.  These include aminosalicylates, antibiotics,  and probiotics.  
6 Study Procedures  
Study visits will be divided into Screening and Randomization Phase  and a Blinded Treatment  
Phase.  Consistent with pragmatic clinical trial design, all study visits  will be conducted in the 
context of routine clinical car e.  As all study participants have a high- risk condition and are being 
treated with a high- risk medical regimen, enrolled patients will have close medical follow -up and 
assessment of outcomes.  Every effort will be made to ensure that patients have at leas t one 
follow- up at approximately 4 weeks following enrollment, at approximately Week 14 (to assess 
induction of remission), at approximately week 26 , and quarterly thereafter.  
 
Data collection and management.   As part of routine care, data on primary study  outcomes are 
already being collected and incorporated into the ICN registry through EHR or web- based data 
capture forms. For this study, standard ICN registry data will be expanded to include additional 
relevant laboratory and other test results  (colonosc opy), AEs, reasons for dose changes or 
discontinuations of anti -TNF therapy, and reasons for study withdrawal.   All non -ICN sites will 
have access to the same systems in place for electronic data capture.

The descriptions below and in the T ime and Events T able (Appendix A ) describe the minimum 
number of visits and requirements at each visit.  As any additional clinic  visits will be considered 
study visits, it is expected that each participant will have more visits than the minimum standard 
as described her e.  These additional visits will also be captured and utilized for th is study. For 
all visits  data collect ion will include Clinical Documentation  and Standard AE reporting.  
 
6.1 Visit 1  (Week -4 to week 0)  
Screening:  
Informed consent (and assent where applicable) will be obtained prior to initiation of any clinical 
screening procedures that are performed solely for the purpose of determining eligibility for this 
study . An enhanced consent process may be utilized.  
 
At this visit, inclusion and exclusion will be reviewed  and documented on an Inclusion/Exclusion 
form.  Laboratory tests used to evaluate and confirm exclusion criteria should be performed as 
close to the screening visit as possible, and not more than 90 days prior to randomization.  For 
females  ≥ 12 y ears of age (or younger, if menses has begun) , a negative pregnancy test will be 
documented (either sent to clinical lab or documented by a provided urine pregnancy kit).  The 
pregnancy test must be performed within 30 days of randomization. Reproductive counseling 
will be given to patient/family by the treating provider and documentation of this will be collected.  
 
**In addition, the following clinical documentation will be collected:  
 
From the existing ImproveCareNow Visit Form:  
Demographics , inclu ding race and ethnicity  
History (to calculate SPCDAI)    
IBD Medications     
Examination including abdominal exam , height and weight (to calculate PCDAI)  
Physician Global Assessment    
Laboratory tests (CRP, ESR, HCT, and albumin)  
Documentation of negative Tuberculosis ( TB) screening within the past year

THERAPY   
 
Version: 10, June 23, 2021  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 25 close to the randomization date as possible, and not more than  30 days prior to the 
randomization date.  
 
If an inpatient consents to trial participation, a supplement to the Trial -specific Screening Form 
will be completed because an ImproveCareNow visit form is not completed in this  setting.  The 
Trial-specific Screening Form will include collection of elements to calculate PCDAI, document 
lab tests (CRP, ESR, HCT, albumin), and to record the Physician Global  Assessment. In both of 
these scenarios, it remains that no trial -specific procedures be performed until consent is 
obtained.   
  
In addition, patients will complete a survey of baseline PROs . This survey may be completed in 
person, or obtained by email, fax, or U.S. mail. If PRO collection is missed at this visit, it can 
also be done at the following visit.  
 
Patients will also be provided with a study diary. Completion of the diary is not required, but will 
be encouraged to assist with treatment compliance and monitoring as well as recall of 
symptoms and AEs.

THERAPY   
 
Version: 10, June 23, 2021  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 26 Randomization and Treatment Initiation:  
If the patient is determined eligible to parti cipate in the study at this visit, the patient will be 
randomized to treatment. Randomization will trigger the central pharmacy to prepare the 
appropriate treatment kit and mail it to the patient’s address.  
 
If the patient  is determined not eligible to participate in the study at this visit  due to outstanding 
laboratory results, the patient will be randomized upon confirmation that all inclusion and no 
exclusion criteria are met. There must be no more than 42 days  between initiation of the anti -
TNF therapy  and the randomization date.   Re-screening is allowed if the patient postpones 
initial treatment with anti -TNF therapy.   
 
If the patient is determined not eligible to participate because he/she does not meet the 
inclusion/excl usion criteria, he/she will be considered a screen failure.  In order to inform 
recruitment efforts, we will collect the reason(s) for ineligibility f or those who fail screening.  
6.2 Follow -up contact (After each shipment of study medication)  
A physician, nurse, or study coordinator  will contact the patient /parent  to ensure they received 
the drug kit  in good condition, review dosing instructions, inquire about adverse effects and 
answer any questions. Preferred method of contact is by phone, however, this c ontac t may also 
accomplished via  email, text or in -person visit.  The date the patient began study drug will be 
recorded.  Nausea should be specifically asked about.  If nausea is documented, then taking the 
ondansetron (or other anti -emetic) should be recommended.  Compliance with the f olic acid will 
also be reinforced.

AEs and Serious AEs Reporting - 
AEs and Serious AEs will be ascertained at each study visit and reported as described in 
Section 8 below.   
 
Other Anticipated (Disease- related) AEs not recorded elsewhere 
 
Study Drug:  Collection of any unused study drug from the prior shipment will be documented. 
Approximately 2 weeks prior to shipment of the next refill, a notification will be sent to the central 
pharmacy . Any change to the study drug dose (including discontinuation) must be documented

additional study visits , data collect ion will include Clinical Documentation and Standard AE 
reporting.  
6.8 Additional Labs (not associated with a visit)  
Any laboratory results collected outs ide of the study visits noted above will be documented in 
the Non-Visit Labs eCRF only if the following criteria are met:  
• The lab test was ordered as a  follow- up to a prior abnormal lab result . 
• The lab test is a specialty  lab - fecal calprotectin, anti -TNF antibody level, anti-TNF 
trough level . 
• The lab test was ordered due to a change in clinical status (i.e. Crohn’s flare  or other  
AE). 
• The lab test result meets the abnormal criteria for AST, ALT, WBC as defined in section 
8.4.3 - Management of Abnormal Laboratory Results.  
 
Note that routine labs which do not meet the above criteria (i.e. labs drawn during infusions not 
associated with clinical visits) do not need to be recorded as additional labs.

THERAPY   
 
Version: 10, June 23, 2021  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 30 6.9 Study Medication Dose Change or Discontinuation 
Any patient  who meets a primary study endpoint or who discontinues their first -line anti -TNF for 
CD for any other reason must discontinue study medications.  Occasionally patients may choose 
to discontinue medications without meeting an outcome.  
 
Any change in the MTX  / placebo dose will be documented by a provider in the trial -specific 
eCRF along with a reason for the change. It is important to complete the dose change eCRF 
promptly since refill shipment / dosing is based on the most recent information entered into the 
EDC system. If a patient discontinues the study medication, the date of last dose, reason for 
treatment discontinuation,  as well as any outcomes met will be documented.  
 
Patient Follow -up Off-study Medication: Patients discontinuing study treatment  will continue to 
be followed for the entire study  period  unless consent is withdrawn for  the remaining study 
procedures. The following study procedures will take place for patients in follow -up, but off study 
drug:  
• Study Visits: Continue to see the patient and  collect data in accordance with the study 
visit schedule.  
• PRO collection: Continue to collect at appropriate time points.  
• Bio sample collection: Collect the first sample pos t-treatment discontinuation. The 
second collection post -treatment discontinuation may be skipped.  
• Lab results : if ordered based on the discretion of the treating provider . 
• Adverse Events : Continue to collect and record for 14 days following final dose of study 
medication.  
• SAEs: Collect and record for the entire duration of follow -up (i .e. until week 104 visit 
completed or the patients withdraws from the study).  
• Follow female participants for pregnancy for 16 weeks after final dose.  
 
The patient should continue to be followed throughout the entire  trial period , and data collected 
per protocol, unless the patient withdraws consent, is lost to follow -up, dies , or the study ends . 
Patients who meet a study endpoint will only be followed for a maximum of two years.  
6.10 Withdraw  of consent /loss to follow up  
For the purposes of the COMBINE trial, th e term “withdrew consent” means that the 
patient/family chooses to fully  discontinue participation in the trial. This includes discontinuation 
of study treatment and all other IRB -approved research activities (including use of routine 
follow- up visit infor mation for trial purposes) . 
 
For patients who are lost to follow up or withdraw consent for  the study, we will collect the 
following data on an early termination form : 
• Date of last MTX/placebo dose (if known)  
• Date of last contact (e.g. visit, phone, email,  etc.) 
• Any known AEs, pregnancy,  medication use, lab and/or colonoscopy results  since last 
study visit . If possible, a plan will be made to following any ongoing AEs or pregnancy 
present at early termination.  
• Any study outcomes met since last study visit  
LOW DOSE ORAL METHOTREXATE IN PEDIATRIC CROHN’S DISEASE PATIENTS INITIATING ANTI -TNF 
THERAPY   
 
Version: 10, June 23, 2021  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 31  
If possible, unused study medication should be collected and documented. The dose change 
eCRF should be completed to discontinue refill shipments of the study drug.  
6.11 Re-consenting current participants  
Current study participants who initially provided consent for a 2- year follow -up period, and who 
have not yet met a study endpoint, will be asked to participate in the longer follow -up period 
beginning at Visit 9, Week 91 (+/ - 6 weeks). Re -consented patients will continue with quarterly 
study visits up to Visit  14, Week 156 (+/ - 6 weeks) or until the study stops.  
6.12  Bio samples  
For trial participants who provide consent for sample collection for research purposes, blood 
samples will be collected at two time points  (Visit 3 and Visit 9).  This collection is consider ed 
optional (i.e. it will not preclude participation in the clinical trial), but will be strongly encouraged.  
 
To avoid a separate venipuncture, t he research blood will be collected at the time of a clinical 
blood draw or prior to an infliximab infusion ( if applicable). When possible, up to four additional 
tubes of blood will be collected to include 2 serum separator tubes  and 2 EDTA tubes . Up to  
21mL  (approximately  1.5 Tablespoons ) of blood will be collected at each time point.  If the 
collection is not feasible at Visit 3 or Visit 9, the samples may be collected at the following visit 
(Visit 4 and Visit 10, respectively).  
 
Samples will be collected at the study site and  shipped to a  central laboratory for processing 
and testing. De -identification of samples will be accomplished by labeling the samples with the  
participant’s unique subject identification number for the trial.  
 
Planned research testing includes measurement of anti -TNF antibodies, anti-TNF trough levels 
as well as neutrophil CD64 surface expr ession and soluble CD64.  
 
Any leftover blood samples will be stored at the central laboratory, in a secure location, at -80 
degrees Celsius , for future research purposes . The central laboratories responsible for stored 
samples include the BioSpecimen Processing Facility at the University of Chapel Hill as well as 
the Laboratory of Dr. Minar at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center.  Future research 
using these samples will be reviewed by an IRB prior to use.   
 
Future testing on these samples may relate to IBD  or other un- related conditions. Testing may 
include, but is not limited to, the following:  
• Genotyping  
• Whole exosome sequencing 
• Immunological tests  
• Additional assays that may be developed in the future  
 
The stored samples may be banked for an inde finite period of time and may be destroyed at any 
time. Test results will not  be reported back to participants and/or their parents or legally 
authorized representatives. There are no plans for subjects to share in financial proceeds that 
may accrue from development of future technologies. Samples may be withdrawn from the 
repository at any time by withdrawing consent for future studies, however, any data that have 
already been derived from testing will not be withdrawn.  
 
LOW DOSE ORAL METHOTREXATE IN PEDIATRIC CROHN’S DISEASE PATIENTS INITIATING ANTI -TNF 
THERAPY   
 
Version: 10, June 23, 2021  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 32 7 Statistical Plan  
7.1 Sample Size Determ ination 
Our sample size calculation is based upon our primary aim and outcome —induction and 
maintenance of steroid free remission.  We estimate our needed sample size on the following 
assumptions:  
1.  Induction and maintenance of steroid -free clinical remi ssion through week 104 will occur in 
50% of the monotherapy group  in 2 years .  This is based on the two adult trials of anti -TNF 
combination versus monotherapy in CD26,28.  In these trials, treatment success rates in the 
monotherapy group at the end of year 1 were 40% and 56%.  We anticipate that treatment 
success will diminish somewhat over the 2nd year of f ollow- up.   Therefore, the actual rates of 
treatment success in our trial may be somewhat less than 50%.  However, as 50% is among the 
possible values, we used it in our power calculations.  This is a conservative assumption, as any 
deviations from this wi ll result in greater statistical power.  
2.  True difference between the two treatment arms will be 15% or more.  We believe that a 
15% difference is the minimum clinically important difference, as smaller effects will not warrant 
the incremental toxicity of combination therapy.  The two adult studies25 26 were powered only to 
detect a 20% and 25% difference; however, we believe that a smaller difference would still be 
clinically meaningful.   We think a 15% differences is a reasonable estimate of the treat ment 
effect.  In the SONIC study (combination therapy with 6MP), the observed difference at 1 year 
was 16%26, and we anticipate a greater difference over an additional year of follow -up.  
Although no difference in treatment arms was observed in the COMMIT study (combination 
therapy with MTX )28, this may have resulted f rom a number of methodological limitations that 
have been addressed by our trial design52.   
3.  We anticipate a loss to follow up of 20%.   Based on data from 2013, loss to follow up in the 
ICN network is approximately 6% per year, or 12% over a two- year trial.  For this trial, we 
assume an additional 5% loss to follow -up to account for withdraws of consent or other reasons 
for study drop -out. We also expect that about 25% of patients who did not have an event by 
year 2 will not sign the consent for an additional year  of treatment and follow -up. 
 
One hundred ninety subjects have been accrued in the first 2 years of the study. Assuming the 
accrual of 9 subjects per months for the remaining 27 months of the study, 190+27*9 = 433  
subjects will be accrued. Based on the assumptions above, we will observe about 152  
treatment failures and achieve 82 % power with two -sided 0.05 level test. These power 
calculations are based on the assumption that time to failure is exponentially distributed . 
7.2 Planned Interim Analysis  
We will perform an interim analysis for efficacy using O’Brien -Fleming boundary  after 76 
patients experience a treatment failure (half of the required treatment failures). The null 
hypothesis will be rejected if the p -value is less than 0.005. The final analysis will be done at 
0.048 𝛼𝛼-level to ensure that the overall 𝛼𝛼 -level does not exceed 0.05.  
7.3 Statistical Methods  
An overview of the statistical analysis can be found below. Full details will be incorporated into a 
separate data analysis plan.   
 
LOW DOSE ORAL METHOTREXATE IN PEDIATRIC CROHN’S DISEASE PATIENTS INITIATING ANTI -TNF 
THERAPY   
 
Version: 10, June 23, 2021  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 33 Primary analyses .  The primary endpoi nt is time to treatment failure. Patients who fail to enter 
remission will be considered as a treatment failure at the visit at or just prior to week 26 .  To 
compare the distribution of time to treatment failure in the two arms w e will compute stratified 
log-rank test stratified by anti -TNF agent prescribed (infliximab and adalimumab).  
Additional analysis of the primary endpoint.  We will also perform  the un-stratified log-rank test . 
Cox model with treatment (MTX versus placebo), site,  anti-TNF agent prescr ibed (infliximab and 
adalimumab) and important covariates (see Potential confounders below)  will be considered .  
Since some sites will recruit a small number of patients, we will combine sites based on the 
geographic location to have a total of 6- 8 site cl usters . 
The Kaplan Meier method will be used to estimate the probabilities of treatment failure, 
induction rates, and the maintenance of steroid free remission rates  at various time points (week 
26, 52, 104, 156 ) in the two groups  (MTX versus placebo) . Sur vival curves will be presented for 
time to induction and time to relapse.  We will also evaluate the probability of treatment failure 
through week 156 .   
 
Analysis of the s econdary endpoints . The three secondary endpoints will be tested using the 
Bonferroni multiple comparison procedure. Since the three secondary endpoints are likely to be 
positively correlated, Bonferroni is a conservative approach to controlling for multiplicity here.  
The first secondary endpoint is the average of PROMIS Pain Interference  T scores at weeks 52 
and 104. We first compare the average of PROMIS Pain Interference T scores at week 52 and 
week 104 between the treatment groups.  If this comparison is significant at 0.05/3 level, we will 
compare the treatment groups based on PROMIS P ain Interference T score at week 52 and 
separately based on week 104 at 0.05/3 level each. To perform this analysis, the means and the 
variability of the PROMIS scores at 52 and 104 weeks will be estimated by fitting mixed model 
for repeated measures (MMRM ) to PROMIS scores at all available time points adjusted for 
important covariates. The second secondary endpoint is the average of PROMIS Fatigue T 
scores at weeks 52 and 104. W e will compare the averages of PROMIS Fatigue T scores at 
week 52 and week 104 between the treatment groups.  If this comparison is significant at 0.05/3 
level, we will compare the treatment groups based on Fatigue T score at week 52 and 
separately based on week 104 at 0.05/3 level each. To perform this analysis, the means and the 
variability of the PROMIS scores at 52 and 104 weeks will be estimated by fitting MMRM to 
PROMIS scores at all available time points adjusted for important covariates. The third 
secondary analysis is the comparison of proportions of patients with positive ant i-TNF antibody 
status based on the sample collected in the second year (week 91). If a sample is not collected 
in the second year, the sample collected in the first year will be used (week 14).  The proportions 
in the two groups (MTX versus placebo) will be  compared using logistic regression with 
adjustment for important covariates using 0.05/3 significance level.  
 
Analysis of additional endpoints .  Additional pre- specified endpoints, listed below, will be 
analyzed using appropriate statistical methods: Wilc oxon rank -sum test to compare mean anti -
TNF levels and dose and chi -squared test to compare proportions. Parameter estimates for 
PROs will be obtained from the MMRM.  
 
1. Mean anti -TNF levels form the specimen collected during 2nd year of follow up.   
2. Proport ion of patients with normal ESR  and mean ESR  at various time points (week 26, 
52, 104) .   
3. Proportion of patients with normal CRP at various time  points (week 26, 52, 104) . 
4. Proportion of patients  at various time points (week 26,  52,104) with the following ( on 
anti-TNF, requiring dose escalation of anti -TNF, without hospitalization, without surgery,

Version: 10, June 23, 2021  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 34 without any steroid for IBD, without steroid for IBD > 10 weeks cumulatively (beyond 
week 16) . 
5. Proportion of patients achieving steroid free remission by the week  26 visit  (+/- on 
original anti TNF and study drug) . 
6. Proportion of patients in steroid free remission at week 104 (+/ - on original anti TNF and 
study drug) . 
7. Proportion of patient s with height velocity Z score at week 104 that is better - 1.  
8. Proportion of patients with normal calprotectin (< 150) at week 104 (select measurement 
between week 52 and 104, closest to 104).  
9. Proportion of patients with endoscopic healing (defined by SES -CD and/or PGA) at week 
104 (select measurement between week 52 and 104, closes t to 104).  
10. PROMIS Positive Affect,  and IBD Symptom PRO T score (continuous variable, mean in 
general population = 50, SD = 10) at week 26,  52, 104. 
11. PROMIS Fatigue and Pain Interference at week 26.  
12. Mean anti -TNF dose (per kg) at week 26,  52, 104 in the two  groups.  
 
Potential confounders.   Adjusted models will consider the following potential confounders, as 
assessed at baseline:  the anti -TNF agent used, SPCDAI score, current or prior use of 
prednisone and other steroid medications , prior use of MTX , prior use of 6 mercaptopurine or 
azathioprine, time from diagnosis (< 2 or ≥ 2 years), elevation of baseline CRP or ESR as a 
measure of inflammation and disease activity, age (< or ≥ 12 years), gender, and race.  
 
Multiplicity adjustment.  A multiple comparison pr ocedure that preserves the type I error rate for 
the study is to perform the test of the primary endpoint using the primary analysis specified in 
the protocol. The primary test is declared to be significant if its p -value is less than 0.05. A 
comparison based on each of the three secondary endpoints is declared to be significant if this 
comparison is significant at 0.05/3 level and if the primary comparison is significant at 0.05 level. 
We will ascertain whether or not the analysis of primary and secondary endpoints is significant 
based on this strict procedure that preservers the study’s overall type I error rate at 0.05.  
 
Pre-specified subgroup analyses . We will perform analysis in the following subgroups: type of  
anti-TNF, time from diagnosis (< 2 or ≥ 2 years) , baseline disease activity ( SPCDAI  score ≥ 30) 
at enrollment,  and elevation of baseline CRP or ESR  as covariates .  Other covariates to 
consider are gender, age (< or ≥ 12 years), race/ethnicity, CD subtype based on the Paris 
Classification , and other relevant clinical/phenotypic characteristics (i.e. presence of perianal 
lesions) .  Additional subgroup analyses based on anti -TNF starting dose will be performed, if 
applicable.  
An additional subgroup analysis will be based upon whether the anti -TNF dose was prescribed 
according to a traditional weight -based dosing model or whether the dose was adjusted based 
upon measurement of trough levels.  We will ascertain the use of level -based dose adjustments 
and will evaluate whether this practice results in higher induction/maintenance of remission or is 
an effect modifier of the combination versus monotherapy comparison.    
For each subgroup analysis, we will: 1) test for an interaction of treatment by subgroup, 2)  
estimate the treatment effects within each subgroup, and 3) use a graphical approach to display 
treatment effects within appropriate subgroups (i.e., meta -analysis forest plot).  Although the 
study will not have adequate power for each of these subgroup analyses, estimating the effect 
size and precisi on will provide very useful hypothesis -generating data, even in the absence of 
statistical significance.

THERAPY   
 
Version: 10, June 23, 2021  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 35  
Missing data.   Some components in the definition of the primary outcome - treatment failure-  
might not be available in some instances. For example, one or more components of the 
SPCDAI may be missing for some visits.  Subjects who are missing more than 10% of the 
SPCDAI components across visits will be excluded from the analysis. Subjects who are missing 
10% or less of the components across visits will be included in the analysis. The missing 
components of the SPCDAI will be imputed based on the estimated joint distribution of the 
SPCDAI compon ents using multiple imputation59.  Missing covariates in our models will be 
imputed using multiple imputation. We will use the Mixed- Effect Model Repeated Measure 
(MMRM) method if some of the repeated measures for secondary outcomes are missing.  
 
Observational CER study of patients treated with thiopurine combination therapy .  Some 
patients in the network will decline study participation and some will undergo treatment with 
combination therapy of anti -TNF and 6MP or azathioprine, either due to patient and/or provider 
preference.  By conducting this trial within IC N, we will be able to perform an observational 
cohort study of these patients.  Specifically, we will compare the baseline characteristics of trial 
participants with patients treated with anti -TNF + 6MP/azathioprine combination therapy.   We 
will also be a ble to perform unadjusted and adjusted analyses comparing the two study arms 
with this 3rd observational arm.  
 
Additional analysis of PROs.  PROs include PROMIS domains, which are continuous measures, 
calibrated using a T -score metric to the US general population with a mean of 50 and standard 
deviation of 10. Minimal important differences (MIDs) for many PROMIS domains are in the 
range of 2 to 6. Our analysis plan will take advantage of the longitudinal nature of selected 
PROs, a nd the MMRM will be used for  analysis. Additionally we will use multiple imputation to 
impute missing covariates and missing outcomes. Groups will be compared over a given set of 
time points.   
 
AEs and safety analyses.  We will use descriptive statistics (e.g., proportions, 95% confidence 
intervals (CI)) to summarize physician reported AEs [grade 2 (moderate) or higher].  We will 
also compare the following safety outcomes between the two treatment groups by estimating 
relative risk and 95% CI: elevated liver enzymes (> 2X upper limit of normal), leukopenia (WBC 
< 3.5), serious infections, malignancies, and nausea.  Interim and final analyses will be 
reviewed by the DSMB  at regular intervals (see Protection of Human Subjects).  In addition to 
safety monitoring during the study period, we  will also perform longer -term safety monitoring 
after the conclusion of the study, as data will continue to be collected on trial participants as part 
of routine clinical care in ICN.  
 
7.4 Subject Population(s) for Analysis  
We will conduct a modified Intent to Treat Analysis. Any subject randomized into the study, who 
was shipped study drug, will be included in the analyses.

THERAPY   
 
Version: 10, June 23, 2021  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 36 8 Safety and AE s 
8.1 AEs 
It is the responsibility of the Principal Investigator to oversee the safety of the study at his/her 
site.  Each inv estigator will be trained in good clinical practices.  This safety monitoring will 
include careful assessment and appropriate reporting of AEs as outlined below. The Investigator 
or site staff is  responsible for detecting, documenting and reporting events that meet the 
definition of an AE (AE) or serious adverse event  (SAE).  
8.1.1  Definition of an AE 
An AE is any unfavorable and unintended symptom, sign, illness or experience, which develops 
or worsens in severity from the date of randomization. .  Inter -current illnesses or injuries should 
be regarded as AEs.  Abnormal results of diagnostic procedures are considered to be AEs if the 
abnormality:  
• results in study withdrawal  
• is associated with a S AE 
• is associated with clinical signs or symptoms  
• leads to additional treatment or to further diagnostic tests  
• leads to a change in MTX/placebo dosing  
• is considered by the investigator to be of clinical significance 
 
Preexisting Conditions  
A preexisting condition is one that is present and documented at the screening visit .  At 
baseline, any ongoing clinically significant abnormality should be recorded as a preexisting 
condition in the CRF.  Preexisting conditions should only be recorded as an AE if the frequency, 
intensity, or the character of the condition worsens during the study period.  
 
Anticipated (Disease Related) Events  
As PCD is a relapsing and remitting condition, and participants in the trial are recruited at a time 
of disease instability requiring initiation of a new treatment regiment, it is anticipated that many 
participants will either worsen or fail to respond initially, or may have a worsening of disease 
after an initial response.  Indeed, the trial outcomes include measures of disease activity, 
hospitalization, surgery, requirement for corticosteroids, etc.  As most data regarding failure to 
respond and/or worsening of PCD are collected through trial CRFs , these anticipated disease-
related events will not need to be reported separately as AEs /SAE’s .   A listing of Anticipated 
Adverse (Disease Related)  Events is provided below:  
• Abdominal mass  
• Fistula  (enterocutaneous, entero- entero, perirectal, recto- vaginal, other Crohn’s related 
fistula)  
• Abscess (abdominal or perirectal)  
• Intestinal perforation 
• Intestinal obstruction 
• Abdominal pain 
• Fatigue  
• Abdominal tenderness  
• Abnormal loss of weight  
• Growth failure 
• GI bleeding related to Crohn’s  
• Diarrhea

Abnormal Laboratory Values  
A clinical laboratory abnormal ity should be documented as an AE if any one of the following  
conditions is met:   
• The laboratory abnormality is not otherwise refuted by a repeat test to confirm the 
abnormality  
• The abnormality suggests a disease and/or organ toxicity  
• The abnormality is of  a degree that requires active management; e.g. change of dose, 
discontinuation of the drug, more frequent follow -up assessments, further diagnostic 
investigation, etc.  
 
Refer to section 8.3.3  for the management of abnormal lab values . 
8.1.2  Definition of a Seri ous AE 
AEs are classified as serious or non -serious.  A serious AE is any AE that is:  
• fatal 
• life-threatening  
• requires or prolongs hospital stay  
• results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
• a congenital anomaly or birth defect (in the offs pring of a study participant)  
• an important medical event  
 
Important medical events are those that may not be immediately life threatening, but are clearly 
of major clinical significance.   They may jeopardize the subject, and may require intervention to 
prevent one of the other serious outcomes noted above.  For example, drug overdose or abuse, 
a seizure that did not result in in- patient hospitalization, or intensive treatment of bronchospasm 
in an emergency department would typically be considered serious.   
 
Hospitalization, Prolonged Hospitalization or Surgery  
 
Any AE that results in hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization should be docum ented and 
reported as a S AE unless specifically instructed otherwise below.  Any condition responsible for 
surgery s hould be documented as an AE if the condition meets the criteria for an AE.   
 
Neither the condition, hospitalization, prolonged hospitalization, nor surgery are reported as an 
AE in the following circumstances:  
 
• Hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization for diagnostic or elective surgical procedures 
for a preexisting condition.  Surgery should not  be reported as an outcome of an AE if the 
purpose of the surgery was elective or diagnostic and the outcome was uneventful.  
 
LOW DOSE ORAL METHOTREXATE IN PEDIATRIC CROHN’S DISEASE PATIENTS INITIATING ANTI -TNF 
THERAPY   
 
Version: 10, June 23, 2021  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 38 • As discussed above in the Anticipa ted AE section, data regarding failure to respond 
and/or worsening of PCD  are collected as part of study outcomes and are captured in the 
existing ImproveCareNow eCRFs . These anticipated disease- related events will not need 
to be reported separately as AEs /SAE’s.  However, if the site investigator believes the 
frequency or severity of a Crohn’s exacerbation or complication deem it to be a SAE, 
then this can be reported at the discretion of the site investigator.  
  
All AEs that do not meet any of the criteria for serious should be regarded as non- serious AEs.  
 
8.2 Pregnancy  
Any pregnancy that occurs during the study and up to 16 weeks following the last study dose 
must be reported on a clinical trial pregnancy report form within 2 weeks of learning of the 
event. This will include any pregnancy in a female trial participant. The pregnancy must be 
followed in order to confirm the outcome and health status of the mother and child. 
 
Maternal and fetal pregnancy complications and elective terminations for medical reasons must 
be reported as an AE or SAE per the definitions above and the instructions in the following 
section. Spontaneous miscarriage must be reported as a S AE. 
 
8.3 Recording of AEs and SAEs  
On enrollment in the study, the patients will be instructed to contac t the investigator if a S AE 
occurs, so that appropriate measures can be taken.  At each contact with the subject, the 
investigator must seek information on AEs by specific questioning and, as appropriate, by 
examination.  
 
Patients in Follow -up, ON Study Medication:  
• All non-serious  AEs occurring from the date of randomization through 14 days following 
the final dose of study medication,  must  be recorded.   
• Any SAE that occurs within 14 days following the final dose of study medication should 
be recorded and reported immediately  (see section 8.5) . 
 
Patients in Follow -up, OFF Study Medication:  
• All non-serious  AEs occurring from the date of randomization and for 14 days following 
the final dose of study medication,  must  be recorded. Any non- serious AEs that occu r 
after day 14 following the final dose of study medication do not need to be recorded.  
• All SAEs occurring from the date of randomization through the completion of study 
follow- up (i.e. until week 156 visit completed or the patients withdraws from the study), 
must be recorded in the eCRF and on the SAE report form and reported  immediately to 
the Safety Medical Monitor (see section 8.5).  
 
Information on all AEs should be recorded immediately in the source document, and also in the 
appropriate AE module of the CRF.   All clearly related signs, symptoms, and abnormal 
diagnostic procedures results should be recorded in the source document, though should be 
grouped under one diagnosis.  
 
LOW DOSE ORAL METHOTREXATE IN PEDIATRIC CROHN’S DISEASE PATIENTS INITIATING ANTI -TNF 
THERAPY   
 
Version: 10, June 23, 2021  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 39 All unresolved AEs should be followed by the investigator until the events are resolved, the 
subject is lost to follow -up, or the AE is otherwise explained.  At the last scheduled visit, the 
investigator should instruct each subject to report any subsequent event(s) per the reporting 
timelines noted above.  
 
8.3.1  Recording and Evaluation of AEs 
The following will be documented for each AE:  
• Nature of the event  
• Start date and stop date  
• Severity  
• Relationship to study treatment and /or procedures involved in research (causality)  
• Action taken  
• Outcome  
• Expectedness  
• Serious ness  (per SAE definition)  
 
Severity  
The severity is evaluated by the investigator as follows:  
Mild - event/symptom does not interfere with normal daily activities  (Grade 1)  
Moderate - event/symptom interferes with normal daily activities  (Grade 2)  
Severe - event/symptom prevents normal daily activities  (Grade 3 or 4)  
 
Relationship to Study Treatment  and/or Procedures Involved in Research 
The relationship is evaluated by the investigator as follows:  
Definitely Related:  
• Reason to conclude that event was at least partially caused by the study medications 
and/or procedures involved in research  
Possibly Related:  
• A reasonable possibility that event was at least partially caused by the study 
medications and/or procedures involved in research  
Not related:  
• Solely caused by the underlying di sease, disorder or condition of the patient 
(including background medication/anti -TNF)  
• Solely caused by other circumstances unrelated to the study medications and/or 
procedures involved in research  
 
Expectedness 
An AE is considered “unexpected”  if it meets  the following criteria:  
• Adverse reactions listed in the package inserts for the study medications -  
Methotrexate, Ondansetron and Folic Acid – that occur at a greater severity, 
frequency and/or specificity than stated.  
• Adverse reactions listed in the pack age inserts for the respective anti -TNF (infliximab 
or adalimumab) - that occur at a greater severity, frequency and/or specificity 
than stated . 
• Progression of PCD or other pre -existing condition that is unusual  in terms of the 
frequency, intensity or char acter.

THERAPY   
 
Version: 10, June 23, 2021  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 40 • Events not identified as known adverse reactions in the package inserts of the study 
medication or background medication.  
 
An AE is considered “expected”  if it meets the following criteria:  
• Common adverse reactions listed in the package inserts for  the study medications - 
Methotrexate, Ondansetron and Folic Acid.  
• Common adverse reactions listed in the package inserts for the respective anti -TNF 
(infliximab or adalimumab). These anti -TNFs are not study medications, however, 
patient s must be starting treatment with one of these medications to be eligible for 
the trial. As such, we expect patients may experience common adverse reactions 
associated with these background medications. This includes infusion or injection-
site reactions.  
• Events related to the natural progression of PCD or other pre -existing condition 
(Note: these events are not to be reported as adverse events per protocol section 
8.1.1).  
 
For the purpose of this trial, all expected AEs will be indicated in a pull -down menu on the AE 
eCRF. Se lection of an event from the pull down menu will automatically assign a determination 
of “expected”. For all other events, the nature of the even t will be entered as free text i n the AE 
eCRF  and the expectedness determination will automatically be assigned  as “unexpected” .  
 
The determination of the expectedness for SAEs  will be made by the sponsor’s safety medical 
monitor based upon the appropriate package insert ( MTX , adalimumab, infliximab)  and criteria 
provided above . 
 
The following will be considered e xpected AEs:  
 
Common adverse reactions  caused by MTX  include the following:  
• anorexia, nausea, vomiting 
• elevation of liver enzymes (AST, ALT, ALP [alkaline phosphatase]  or GGT  [gamma -
glutamyltransferase] ) 
• stomatitis  
• malaise  
• fatigue  
• abdominal discomfort  
• chills  
• fever  
• dizziness  
• diarrhea  
• anemia 
• thrombocytopenia 
• leukopenia 
• rash

In addition to the items documented for each AE  (see section 8.3.1), the following will be 
documented for each SAE:  
 
• Brief description of the event  
• Category of the event  
o death,

o other (per the investigator’s discretion)  
• Intervention taken  
• List of relevant tests, laborat ory data, history, including pre- existing medical conditions  
8.4 Management of AE s 
8.4.1  General  
The clinical course of each event should be followed until resolution, stabilization, or until it has 
been determined that the study treatment or participation is not the cause.  Serious AEs that are 
still ongoing at the end of the study period must be followed up to determine the final outcome.   
 
Any AE or SAE leading to permanent discontinuation of study medication is considered a 
primary endpoint ( i.e. study drug or a nti-TNF intolerance or toxicity)  and should be documented 
as such in the CRF.

THERAPY   
 
Version: 10, June 23, 2021  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 42 8.4.2  Management of Nausea 
All patients will receive an age-  based dose of ondansetron or matching placebo along with their 
MTX  (or matching placebo).  This will be taken at the same time as the MTX /placebo to prevent 
nausea.   
 
In addition, each participant’s treating prescription will provide a prescription for an age based 
dose of ondansetron to be taken on a PRN basis if symptoms of nausea develop.  Note that for 
patients who recei ve ondansetron as part of their study medication AND take a PRN dose 
prescribed by their physician, the total dosage will not exceed the maximum dosage for this 
medication.  
 
For significant nausea not relieved with ondansetron , the patient’s physician will use their 
clinical judgment  to determine whether they think the nausea is related to the study drug or is 
due to a different etiology (underlying Crohn’s or complication of Crohn’s, infection, etc.) and will 
evaluate as appropriate.  
 
Nausea that occurs only on the day of or 24 hours following study drug administration will be 
suspected as being related to the study drug.  In this instance, the following week’s dose of 
study drug will be skipped to further evaluate for causation.  If nausea continues in the  absence 
of receipt of study drug, it will not be considered to be drug related.  If nausea subsides with 
holding the study drug, it will be considered highly likely to be a consequence of the study drug.  
The patient will be tried on study drug for 1 addi tional week.  If nausea develops, it will be 
determined to be related to study drug.  If nausea is significant enough, the patient, caregiver, or 
treating physician may choose to discontinue treatment with study medication.  
8.4.3  Management of Abnormal Laborator y Results  
 
All laboratory values outside of the normal range will be repeated if judged appropriate by the 
investigator to ensure the validity of the abnormal result. The investigator will assess the 
etiology of the clinically relevant abnormal laboratory values  and will document relevant 
laboratory values in the CRF as outlined in section 6.0.

THERAPY   
 
Version: 10, June 23, 2021  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 43 Monitoring of abnormal liver enzymes and complete blood count  
- If the AST or ALT (LFT’s) increase ≥ 2 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) after the start of 
the study medication, the investigator will repeat the measurements of LFTs after 2- 3 weeks. If 
LFTs normalize the patient will continue with current dose of MTX/placebo, however, if LFTs 
remain elevated ≥ 2 times the upper limit at second draw, the dose of M TX/placebo should be 
reduced to ½ of the participant’s starting dose.  Another check of LFT’s should be performed 
after 4 weeks at the lower dose. If the LFT’s normalizes or return to less than 2X upper limit of 
normal, then patient should remain on ½ of t he starting dose and further laboratory monitoring 
of the LFT’s should be performed in the setting of the regular lab draws in the context of the 
regular study visits.  If LFTs remain elevated > 2x ULN upon recheck, participant must stop 
therapy with MTX/placebo.  
 
-If WBC below 3.5  x10 9 /L but above 3.0 x10 9 /L, the investigator should repeat C BC within 2 
weeks.  If WBC > 3.5  x10 9 /L, it is acceptable  to continue MTX/placebo.  If WBC below 3.5 x10 9 
/L but above 3.0 x10  9 /L, the dose of MTX/placebo should be reduced to ½ of the participant’s 
starting dose.  Repeat CBC should be obtained in approximately 2 weeks.  
 
- If WBC below 3.0 x10 9 /L, the investigator should stop therapy with MTX/placebo and perform 
another blood draw within 14 days. If repeat WBC  is ≥ 3.5 x10 9 /L, then patient may resume 
MTX/placebo therapy at ½ of the participant’s starting dos e. If WBC is between 3.0 and 3.5, 
CBC should be repeated within 2 weeks.  If repeat WBC is ≥ 3.5 x10 9 /L, then patient may 
resume MTX/placebo therapy at ½ of the participant’s starting dose. If WBC remains less than 
3.5, participant must stop therapy with MTX/placebo. If WBC should drop again below 3.0 x10  9 
/L, participant must stop therapy with MTX/placebo.  
 
Stop of study medication in case of following pathologic laboratory values:  
- Renal dysfunction as defined by 1) creatinine >  0.8 for children age<10, creatinine > 1.2 mg/dl  
for children age 10- 18, and creatinine > 1.5 mg/dl  for adults age 18 years and older or 2) 
increase of 0.5 mg/dL compared to bas eline value) .  
- Hepatic dysfunction as defined as an increase of AST or ALT ≥ 3 times upper limit of normal 
after the start of study medication or persistent elevation > 2X normal as described above  
- Drop of WBC below 3.0 x10 9 /L despite dose reduction of MTX after the start of study 
medication.  
8.4.4  Pregnancy 
Any pregnancy in a female trial participant  will result in  immediate discontinuation of  study  
medication. The participant should be unblinded to determine potential risk to the mother and 
fetus. Pregnancies amongst those participants receiving MTX  will be followed  in order to confirm 
the outcome and health status of the mother and baby.  The patient will remain in follow -up for 
up to the 156-week trial period.  
8.5  Reporting of Serious AE s 
In addition to recording all AEs and SAEs in the appropriate CRF module, investigators and the 
protocol sponsor must conform to the AE reporting timelines, formats and requirements of the  
DSMB,  IRB (institutional review board) , and any other regulatory entity  to which they are 
responsible. At a minimum those events that must be reported are those that are:  
• related to study participation,  
• unexpected,  
• serious or involve risks to subjects or others (see definitions, section 8.1.2 ),  
• not deemed to be a consequence of the patient’ s underlying CD

THERAPY   
 
Version: 10, June 23, 2021  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 44  
If the report is supplied as a narrative, the minimum necessary information to be provided at the 
time of the initial report includes:  
• Study identifier  
• Study Center  
• Subject number  
• A description of the event  
• Date of onset  • Current status  
• Whether study treatment was discontinued 
• The reason why the event is classified as 
serious  
• Investigator assessment of the association 
between the event and study treatment  
 
Any SAE (including death, irrespective of the cause) must be reported without delay, within 24 
hours , in accordance with the guidelines in section 8.3.  The Serious AE (SAE) form must be 
completed by the investigator, and sent by facsimile to the study Safety Medical M onitor:  
 
Hans Herfarth, M.D.  
University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill  
Fax: 919 843- 6633  
Phone: (919) 966- 6806  
Email:  hans_herfarth@med.unc.edu  
 
Within the following 48 hours, the investigator must provide further informat ion on the S AE or 
the unanticipated problem in the form  of a written narrative.  This should include a copy of the 
completed S AE form, and any other diagnostic information that will assist the understanding of 
the event , including de- identified medical and/or hospital records, where applicable.  Significant 
new information on ongoing S AEs should be provided promptly to the study sponsor. The 
investigator will keep a copy of this SAE form on file at the study site.  
 
The Safety Medical M onitor will perform a regular assessment of  the number and type of S AEs.  
8.5.1  Investigator reporting  
Investigators are responsible for safety reporting to the central and/ or  local IRBs. Investigators 
are responsible for complying with the central and/or local  IRB’s reporting requirements, though 
must submit the required reports no late r than 10 working days.  Copies of each report and 
documentation of IRB notification and receipt will be kept in the investigator’s study file.  
8.5.2  Sponsor reporting  
The study sponsor will  notify all participating investigator s, as well as the central IRB, of  relevant 
DSMB safety reports as described in section 8.7.1.  
8.6 Unblinding Procedures  
Every attempt will be made to preserve blinding during and after completion of the trial.   
However, unblinding will be allowed in certain instances where knowledge of the tr eatment 
assignment will significantly impact a patient’s subsequent treatment.   As such, unblinding will 
be considered for participants who meet a study endpoint on a case by case basis, upon the 
request of the patient’s treating physician.   All requests f or unblinding will be reviewed by a 
committee of expert IBD physicians.   Additionally, patients who become pregnant over the 
course of the study will be unblinded.    Unblinding will also be permitted for certain AEs or SAEs 
for which unblinding is necessar y to manage the AE or SAE or if it will affect future treatment 
LOW DOSE ORAL METHOTREXATE IN PEDIATRIC CROHN’S DISEASE PATIENTS INITIATING ANTI -TNF 
THERAPY   
 
Version: 10, June 23, 2021  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 45 decisions.  In the event of medical emergencies that require immediate unblinding, physicians 
will have access to a 24- hour pager .  
Scheduled unblinding at end of study  
Patients who complete t he study and are still undergoing treatment with study medication will be 
offered the opportunity to be informed of their treatment allocation while participating in the trial.  
This will occur at  either at Visit 14, Week 156 (+/ - 6 weeks) or when the study  closes. 
Specifically, the Study Completion eCRF and the week 156 (Last Visit) form will be completed. 
The patient’s treatment assignment will be available within the online Unblinding Report within 
24 hours .   Patients who originally consented to the 24 m onth trial and do not wish to re- consent 
for the additional year of follow up will be offered unblinding at the end of their two year follow -
up, provided they are still taking study medication.  
8.7 Stopping Rules  
We decided against early stopping for futilit y as a full two years of follow up may be necessary 
to observe treatment effects.  By the time sufficient patients complete two years of follow up to 
complete a futility analysis, the trial will be too far along to make early stopping worthwhile.  
 
We will consider early stopping for efficacy.  As discussed above, w e will perform an interim 
analysis using O’Brien- Fleming boundary after 73 patients experience a treatment failure (half of 
the required treatment failures). The null hypothesis will be rejected i f the p -value is less than 
0.005. Any decision for early stopping for efficac y will be the decision of the DSMB  as discussed 
below.  
 
If serious safety concerns arise, the coordinating investigator can terminate or interrupt the 
study by agreement with the sponsor. If new information on the risk -to-benefit ratio of the drug 
or on the treatment methods used in the study is obtained in the meantime, the coordinating 
investigator reserves the right to interrupt or terminate the project by agreement with the 
sponsor. Premature termination is also possible if the coordinating investigator, or the 
investigators and the sponsor determine that patient recruitment is insufficient and cannot be 
expedited by appropriate measures.  
 
We will also consider stopping our nest ed trial of  enhanced vs. standard pre- consent discussion 
as outlined in section 7. 5.   
8.7.1  Independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board 
An independent DSMB  will regularly review interim data to monitor safety and effectiveness and 
recommend whether the trial s hould continue.  The DSMB has overall responsibility for 
interpreting data on AE s.  This group reviews unblinded data every six months and makes 
recommendations to the Study Leadership Committee regarding actions to ensure that 
participants are not exposed to undue risks.  Summary reports of the meetings are sent to the 
site investigators and the central IRB .  
Committee Members    
Members are independent experts chosen on the basis of their expertise and scientific rigor.  
They are not associated with the tr ial or with the pharmaceutical companies that supply the 
study agents.  Committee members’ areas of expertise span the disciplines relevant to the 
conduct of this pragmatic clinical trial, including epidemiology, clinical trials, pharmacology, 
biostatistic s, and clinical care, including treatment with anti -TNF biologics and MTX . Members of

THERAPY   
 
Version: 10, June 23, 2021  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 46 the Committee are named below.  Additional/alternate members that may be identified by 
PCORI will also be included.  
• Committee Chair:   Dr. Brian Smith, Duke University, p ediatric clinical trials expert  
• Dr. Todd MacKenzie, Dartmouth Geisel School of Medicine, biostatistician 
• Dr. Jenifer Lightdale, University of Massachusetts, pediatric gastroenterologist and division 
chief  
 
Committee Mandates    
The Committee has the responsibility to review the research protocol and to evaluate the 
progress of the trial overall and at each participating clinical center.  This includes accrual, data 
quality and completeness, episodes of hospitalization, mortality, other toxicities, and protocol 
violations.  Serious unexpected events will be disclosed to the committee between meetings.  
The Committee will also review interim endpoint data (both primary and secondary endpoints).   
The Committee will begin its work on this trial by identifying k ey data points that will be 
monitored at each of the interim meetings.  The DSMB will work closely with the investigators 
and biostatistician to develop study -wide stopping rules.    
Concurrently, the Committee will evaluate participant risk vs benefit as the trial progresses, 
considering evolving scientific discoveries or treatment options that may affect the desirability of 
continued treatment.  At the conclusion of each meeting, the Committee will recommend 
whether the trial be continued. If study medication proves to be more harmful than expected in 
terms of mortality or severe morbidity, we will stop the trial early.  This decision will be made by 
the study investigators on recommendation of our Safety and Data Monitoring Committee.  
Frequency of Committ ee Meetings   
The Committee will confer at six -month intervals, generally by telephone or webinar.  
Committee Meeting Structure   
The study’s principal investigator, Michael Kappelman, MD, MPH, and the study’s statistician, 
Anastasia Ivanova, PhD, and on occasion other key personnel, will participate in the meetings’ 
open sessions, which includes consideration of trial progress, general scientific issues, etc.  The 
Committee’s voting members will discuss in closed session unblinded data regarding endpoints 
and toxicities and other material that should be kept confidential from the investigators.  This will 
likely include comparisons of the following safety outcomes by estimating relative risk and 95% 
CI:  elevated liver enzymes (> 2X normal), leukopenia (WBC < 3.0), serious infections, 
malignancies, and nausea.   
Frequency and content of reports to the Safety and Data Monitoring Committee  
Every six months, the lead programmer at the coordinating center will prepare a report for 
DSMB review.  The report will cont ain the following categories of information aggregated by 
masked treatment group.  
• Current enrollment status and timeline for completion of follow -up    
• AEs reported, including hospitalizations and any mortality  
• 1st and 2nd order protocol violations  
• Endpoint data  
• Numbers of patients whose study medication is discontinued  
Unexpected serious events are reported to the Safety and Data Monitoring Committee between 
meetings.

Following each meeting of the S afety and Data Monitoring Committee, its chair will prepare a 
report on the questions raised by Committee members, monitoring recommendations, and 
recommendations for the continuation of the trial. This report will be distributed confidentially to 
meeting participants.  The Committee’s secretary also prepares a redacted summary of this 
report, focusing on safety issues, for distribution to clinical center co -investigators and their 
IRBs.  
9 Data Handling and Record Keeping 
9.1 Confidentiality  
Information about study subjects will be kept confidential and managed according to the 
requirements of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA).  Those 
regulations require a signed subject authorization informing the subject of the following:  
• What protected health information (PHI) will be collected from subjects in this study  
• Who will have access to that information and why  
• Who will use or disclose that information  
• The rights of a research subject to revoke their authorization for use of their PHI.  
 
In the event that a subject revokes authorization to collect or use PHI, the investigator, by 
regulation, retains the ability to use all information collected prior to the revocation of subject 
authorization.  For subjects that have revoked authoriz ation to collect or use PHI, attempts 
should be made to obtain permission to collect at least vital status (i.e. that the subject is alive) 
at the end of their scheduled study period.  
9.2 Source Documents  
Source data is all information, original records of cli nical findings, observations, or other 
activities in a clinical trial necessary for the reconstruction and evaluation of the trial.  Source 
data are contained in source documents.  Examples of these original documents, and data 
records include: hospital records, clinical and office charts, laboratory notes, memoranda, 
subjects’ diaries or evaluation checklists, pharmacy dispensing records, recorded data from 
automated instruments, copies or transcriptions certified after verification as being accurate and 
complete, microfiches, photographic negatives, microfilm or magnetic media, x -rays, subject 
files, and records kept at the pharmacy, at the laboratories, and at medico- technical 
departments involved in the clinical trial.  
9.3 Data Collection and Management  
9.3.1  Case Report Forms  
As part of routine care, data on primary study outcomes  are already  collected and incorporated 
into the ICN registry through EH R or web -based data capture forms. In addition, electronic 
CRFs will be used for data collection in order to captur e trial -specific information. Data reported 
on the CRF, that are derived from source documents, should be consistent with the source 
documents or the discrepancies should be explained. The site investigator should ensure the 
accuracy, completeness, legibil ity, and timeliness of the data reported to the sponsor in the 
CRFs and in all required reports. In the event of incomplete or inconsistent data, correction 
and/or clarification will be requested from the site. The names of all persons authorized to make 
entries and/or corrections on CRFs must be maintained in a delegation log. Registry and 
electronic CRF data collection and management activities will be performed by the data and site

analysis and reporting.  
9.3.2  Patient Surveys and Questionnaires  
Participant knowledge surveys  for the nested trial of pre -consent discussion will be administered 
to participants via a paper form. The paper forms will be scanned at the local study sit e and 
transmitted electronically  to the data and site coordinating center . Dr. Lipstein and Dr. Brinkman 
from Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center will oversee data collection, entry, analysis , 
and reporting for the nested trial.  
 
PRO surveys will be administered to patients via a paper form. The paper surveys will be 
scanned at the local study site and transmitted electronically to the Children’s Hospital of 
Philadelphia for data entry and scoring. PRO results will be transferred to the data coordinating 
center and the UNC statistical core  for data analysis and reporting.  
9.4 Records Retention  
The investigator must retain all study records and source documents for the maximum period 
required by their institution or as required by local and national governing regulations, whichever 
is longer. Study records include consent forms, distribution and inventory of investigational drug 
(as applicable), and source documentation. The investigator must contact the sponsor prior to 
destroying any records associated with the study.  
 
10 Study Monitoring, Auditing, and Inspecting 
10.1 Study Monitoring Plan 
Representatives of the study sponsor will monitor compliance with the current protocol / 
amendment(s) and with applicable regulatory requirements. A Risk Bas ed Monitoring strategy 
will be taken and monitoring will be conducted remotely unless a site visit is warranted.   
Monitoring efforts will focus on elements that have been identified as being critical to the 
research goals, data integrity, and protection of  study participants.  
 
The Investigator will  ensure that the monitor or other compliance or quality assurance reviewer 
is given direct access to all  study -related source documents. To provide remote access to 
critical source documents , this may involve printing, redact ing, coding, scanning and emailing or 
uploading the documents for the monitor’s review.  
 
If a site visit is warranted, the Investigator will ensure that the monitor has direct access to 
study -related facilities (e.g. pharmacy, diagnostic labor atory, etc.), and has adequate space to 
conduct the monitoring visit . The investigator will allocate adequate time for all monitoring 
activities.   
10.2 Auditing and Inspecting 
The investigator will permit study -related monitoring, audits, and inspections of al l study related 
documents (e.g. source documents, regulatory documents, data collection instruments, study 
data etc.) by the IRB, the sponsor, government regulatory bodies, and any compliance and 
quality assurance groups from the investigator’s institution .  The investigator will ensure the 
capability for inspections of applicable study -related facilities (e.g. pharmacy, diagnostic 
laboratory, etc.).

THERAPY   
 
Version: 10, June 23, 2021  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 49 Participation as an investigator in this study implies acceptance of potential inspection by the 
IRB, the s ponsor, government regulatory bodies, and any compliance and quality assurance 
groups from the investigator’s institution. If informed of such an inspection, the investigator 
should notify the sponsor immediately.  
11 Ethical Considerations  
This study is to be conducted according to US and international standards of Good Clinical 
Practice ( FDA Title 21  part 50, part 56  and ICH guidelines), applicable government regulations 
and Institutional research policies and procedures.  
 
This protocol and any amendments wi ll be submitted to a centralized, properly constituted 
independent Ethics Committee (EC)  or IRB , for formal approval of the study conduct.  The 
decision of the EC/IRB concerning the conduct of the study will be made in writing to the 
investigator and a copy of this decision will be provided to the sponsor before commencement 
of this study.  The sponsor and investigator will maintain a  list of the central EC/IRB members 
and their affiliates in their files . 
 
All subjects  (and/or the subject’s legally authoriz ed representative)  for this study will be provided 
a consent form describing this study and providing sufficient information for subjects  (and/or 
their legally authorized representative)  to make an informed decision about their participation in 
this study.  The sponsor will provide the investigator with appropriate sample informed consent 
forms.  These  consent form s will be submitted with the protocol for review and approval by the 
EC/IRB for the study.  The formal consent of a subject  (and/or the subject’s l egally authorized 
representative) , using the EC/IRB -approved consent form, must be obtained before that subject 
undergoes any study procedure.  The consent form must be signed by the subject (and/or the 
legally authorized representative) , and the investigator -designated research professional 
obtaining the consent.  
 
Spanish- speaking patients may be rec ruited for this trial at study sites  with a significant 
Spanish- speaking population. The informed consent and other essential patient -facing 
recruitment and s tudy materials will be translated to Spanish and certified by back translation. 
The translated documented will be submitted to a properly constituted independent Ethics 
Committee (EC)  or IRB, for formal approval. The decision of the EC/IRB concerning the 
translated materials  will be made in writing to the investigator and a copy of this decision will be 
provided to the sponsor before being used for recruitment of Spanish -speakers . 
 
All subjects enrolled as children and who tur n 18 during the study will be c onsented as adults at 
the earliest opportunity  (but no later than 6 months after reaching age of consent).  The same 
process will be followed if parents /patients  need to be re- consented during the study for any 
other reason (i.e. new information becomes available).  
 
12 Study Finances  
12.1 Funding Source  
This research study is partially funded through a Patient - Centered Outcomes Research 
Institute (PCORI) Awa rd (PCS -1406- 18643 ). The Patient -Centered Outcomes Research 
Institute (PCORI) is an independent, nonprofit or ganization authorized by Congress in 2010. Its

committed to continual ly seeking input from a broad range of stakeholders to guide its work.  
 
Additional funding is provided by  the ImproveCareNow  Network , The Leona M. and Harry B. 
Helmsley Charitable Trus t, Grifols Diagnostics Solutions Inc  and the National Institutes of 
Health.  
 
ImproveCareNow is a 501(c ) 3 non-profit organization.  Its purpose is to transform the health, 
care and costs for all children and adolescents with CD and ulcerative colitis by building a 
sustainable collaborative chronic care network, enabling patients, families, clinicians and 
researchers to work together in a learning health care system to accelerate innovation, 
discovery and the application of new knowledge.   
 
The Helmsley Charitable Trust supports leading research institutions across the globe in an 
unprecedented effort to find a cure—and until then better treatments —for IBD and Crohn’s 
disease.   
12.2 Conflict of Interest  
Any investigator who has a conflict of interest with this study (patent ownership, royalties, or 
financial gain greater than the mini mum allowable by their institution, etc.) must have the conflict 
reviewed by a properly constituted Conflict of Interest Committee with a Committee- sanctioned 
study specific conflict management plan that has been reviewed and approved by the IRB 
providing oversight for that investigator prior to participation in this study. This information shall 
also be made available to the study sponsor upon request or as required under any separately 
executed agreement between the sponsor and study site.  
12.3 Subject Stipends or Payments  
Patients will be reimbursed $25 for each of two blood collections that are sent to the biobank  
and $10 for each completed PRO form.  The maximum reimbursement will be $11 0 per patient 
over the course of the study.  
 
The majority of  study procedures are performed as part of routine care and will be billed to the 
patient or their insurance. Procedures performed solely for research purposes will not be billed 
to the patient , nor their insurance, but will be covered by the study (i.e. pregnancy tes ts, tubes 
for serum bio samples , PRO collection ). Neither  the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, 
nor PCORI, has set aside funds to pay patients for any study -related reaction or injury, or for the 
related medical care.   
13 Publication Plan 
Dissemina tion of study results is an essential component of this research project.  Regardless of 
the outcome of the trial, we submit study findings to high- impact, peer -reviewed journals and 
present results in the form of abstracts at scientific meetings.  We will  also make our research 
findings publicly available on the ICN and PCORI websites, including lay summaries of relevant 
findings.

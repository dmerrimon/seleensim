The purpose of this amendment is to update the eligibility criteria to reflect that liposomal cytarabine combined with daunorubicin ( CPX -351) may be considered one of the 
allowed types of induction therapy for front-line AML that subjects must undergo prior to enrollment on this study. This change is the result of changes in standard of care AML therapy.  A lso, an echocardiogram is now required as a pre -study assessment.  
 
Additional major changes to the protocol include: subjects will be allowed to receive 2 years of pembrolizumab therapy on this clinical trial as opposed of the before allowed 1 year of therapy, subjects will be allowed  to undergo allogeneic stem cell infusion after 
greater than 21 days have elapsed as opposed to the previously mandated 30 days, an additional correlative objective will be assessed to determine the presence of minimal residual disease after pembrolizumab therapy and dose modification and supportive care guidelines for pembrolizumab will be based on the updated package insert recommendations. 
 
 
Editorial, Administrative Changes 
• Removal of UNCCN  to change to  LCCC CPO Multicenter/LCCC Multicenter  
• Added in LCCC CPO Multicenter e -mail address throughout 
“(CPOMulticenter@med.unc.edu ” as a source of contact  
• Table 3 - change formatting and changed title to “Dose Modifications” 
• Section 6.8 assessment of safety was clarified to indicated that only subjects who 
receive pembrolizumab will be evaluable for safety assessments . Additional 
clarification was made to sections 2.4.2 and 4.6 to clarify removing subjects from study due to unacceptable AEs refers to the section of the study when subjects are receiving pembrolizumab therapy and not the induction therapy phase.

4 1.0 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
1.1 Study Synopsis  
This is a n open- label , single arm , multicenter  phase 2  study of standard salvage 
high dose cytarabine (HiDAC) on days 1 through 5 followed by a single dose of  
the humanized monoclonal antibody targeted against cell surface receptor 
programmed cell death -1 (PD -1), pembrolizumab, on day 14 as induction therapy 
in patients with relapsed and refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Patients 
who achieve at least a partial response (PR) post-induction will continue on 
pembrolizumab every 3 weeks for up to 1 year of maintenance therapy. We plan to enroll 37 patients in a Simon’s two -stage design.  
 
The hypothesis of this study is that HiDAC followed by pembrolizumab will be effective in relapsed and refractory AML with a combined complete remission (CR)/CR with incomplete recovery (CRi) ) rate of >40%, superior to a historical 
control of 20%. We also hypothesize that  the rate of unacceptable toxicity 
associated with  HiDAC  followed by pembrolizumab will not significantly exceed 
20% (see section 2.4.2 ). Secondary endpoints include toxicity of this combination 
when used as induction, overall objective response rate (CR+CRi +PR ) post-
induction, toxicity of pembrolizumab maintenance in those patients with a response after induction, and progression -free survival  (PFS) , relapse- free 
survival (RFS)  and overall survival (OS) in patients who re ceive maintenance 
pembrolizumab. We will also explore for an  association between potential 
immun e biomarkers and clinical outcomes with pembrolizumab. The overarching 
goals of these correlative studies are: 1) to identify and characteriz e mechanisms 
involved in T cell dysfunction in AML, 2) to identify potential predictive 
biomarker candidates to allow better selection of AML patients who may benefit 
from pembrolizumab, and 3) to identify new pathways that could be targeted to 
enhance the efficacy of pembrolizumab in AML. 
1.2 Relapsed and Refractory AML  
AML has an extremely poor prognosis with conventional chemotherapy agents. While approximately 70% of patients are expected to achieve a CR following intensive induction chemotherapy, the majority of these patients ultimately relapse and die of AML.
1 The European LeukemiaNet analyzed the 3 -year 
relapse- free survival (RFS) rates o f 1,550 patients treated on front- line Cancer and 
Leukemia Group B (CALGB) studies in AML between 1985 and 2006. Patients were stratified on this study based on cytogenetic and molecular risk factors into 4 risk groups: favorable, intermediate-1, intermedi ate-2 and adverse. The 3- year 
RFS rates were 55%, 23%, 34%, and 10% among younger (<60 years) patients in the favorable, intermediate- 1, intermediate -2, and adverse risk groups, 
respectively. In comparison, older patients (>60 years) had distinctively wors e 
outcomes across each subset with 3 -year RFS rates of 24%, 10%, 11%, and 6% 
among favorable, intermediate-1, intermediate-2, and adverse risk, respectively.2

Patients who do not respond to intensive induction chemotherapy (i.e., primary 
refractory  disease) have an even worse outcome with an overall response rate of 
<20% with salvage chemotherapy agents.3 Long -term survival in primary 
refractory AML patients is <5 -10%.4   In contrast, the overall outcome of patients 
with relapsed  AML is dependent on multiple factors such as total duration of CR, 
age, performance status, cytogenetics/molecular markers, and previous allogeneic stem cell transplantation.
5 Based on these factors, Breems et al. stratified first 
relapse patients into 3 prognostic groups: favorable, intermediate and poor-risk. One-year overall survival (OS) was 70%, 49% and 16%, for favorable, 
intermediate, and poor- risk relapsed AML patients, respectively.  
5  
 Advanced age appears to be the most negative predictor of overall outcome in patients with relapsed AML. Rowe et al. reported in abstract form results from various Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) studies of 362 patients >55 years who initially achieved a CR with induction therapy. Sixty- five percen t 
of these patients subsequently relapsed with a median overall survival (OS) <5 months and 5- year OS  of 6% after disease relapse.
6,7  
 The management of relapsed and refractory AML continues to be a major challenge. There is no accepted standard chemotherapeutic regimen for relapsed and refractory AML. A multitude of chemotherapeutic regimens exist but none of 
these regimens have consistently proven to be superior. High dose cytarabine 
(HiDAC) 3 gm/m
2 administered intravenously ( IV) Q12hours for 12 doses is one 
commonly used treatment in this setting, and has been evaluated  with and without 
the addition of anthracyclines in patients with relapsed and refractory AML. Data on this regimen are summarized in the next section. 
1.3 Cytarabine 
Cytarabine (cytosine arabinoside) is a nucleoside analog that incorporates into 
human DNA in the S phase of the cell cycle. Cytarabine is widely considered the most effective anti -leukemic chemotherapeutic agent in AML. HiDAC, with and 
without anthracyclines, has been evaluated in 78 relapsed and refractory AML patients (age range: 12 -72 years). Thirty -four of these patients received HiDAC 
alone (3 gm/m
2 IV Q12hours days 1- 6) and 44 patients received HiDAC (same 
dose and schedule) + daunorubicin 30 mg/m2 IV days 7 -9. The overall CR rates 
were similar between HiDAC and HiDAC + daunorubicin (44% vs. 59%, respectively; p=0.09). Median duration of response was only 5 months in both arms. In the HiDAC alone arm, there was a clear difference in CR rates between relapsed disease (CR rates = 63%) and primary refractory AML (CR rates = 20%).   In the HiDAC alone arm, all patients achieved bone marrow aplasia, and 91% of patients in both arms developed fevers. The percentage of patients with non-hematologic toxicities by organ system in the HiDAC alone arm were as follows: 
LCCC 1522  CONFIDENTIAL

6 eye (23% when eye drops were used; 76% when they were not); skin (32%), 
nausea and vomiting (88%), diarrhea (39%),  and abnormal liver chemistries 
(79%). Moreover, 12% of patients had CNS toxicity with HiDAC alone, typically 
manifested as mild -moderate neurologic impairment, with 6% (n=2) experiencing 
Grade 3 CNS toxicity that resolved afte r treatment discontinuation.8 For 
additional information regarding adverse events and possible risks of cytarabine, please see section 5.0.   Recent studies have suggested that cytarabine alone has response rates 15 -20% in 
relapsed and refractory AM L patients. A randomized phase III study compared 
vosaroxin + cytarabine versus cytarabine alone (1 gm/m
2 IV daily for 5 days) in 
relapsed and refractory AML patients. The CR rate for patients on the vosaroxin + cytarabine arm was 30% versus 16% in patients on the cytarabine only arm.
9 An 
international randomized phase III study of elacytarabine compared with physicians choice, which included high dose cytarabine, also showed CR rates of approximately 20% in the physician’s choice arm . 
10Additionally, a randomized 
phase II  study by ECOG recently compared three different promising regimens 
for relapsed and refractory AML: Arm A: carboplatin + topotecan, Arm B: flavopiridol + cytarabine + mitoxantrone (FLAM), Arm C: Sirolimus + Mitoxantrone + Etoposide + Cytarabine. FLAM was shown to be the most effective regimen in this trial, with a CR rate of 28%, while  Arm A and Arm C 
produced CR rates of 14% and 15%, respectively.
11  
 
It is unclear whether 3 gm/m2 of cytarabine is necessary and whether this dose is 
superior to 2 gm/m2. Moreover, high doses of cytarabine (>2 gm/m2) appear to 
increase the risk for cerebellar toxicity, especially in older patients and those with renal disease.
12 HiDAC at doses of 1- 2 gm/m2 has also been evaluated in 
combination with other chemotherapy agents in relapsed and refractory AML patients, such as topoisomerase inhibitors (mitoxantrone and etoposide),
3,13-15 
fludarabine16, cladribine17,18, and clofarabine.19,20 Response rates seen with these 
combinations range from 20-50% (median duration of response <9 months), with significant toxicities; 30-day mortality rates  of these regimens range from  10-
30%.   Given these data, there is a high unmet need to develop safe and effective novel therap eutic regimens for patients with refractory and relapsed AML. 
Investigational therapies are warranted in relapsed and refractory AML and are 
highly recommended over other conventional chemotherapy regimens.

1.4 Pembrolizumab  
Pembrolizumab (MK -3475) is a potent and highly selective IV humanized 
monoclonal antibody (mAb) of the immunoglobulin (Ig) G4/kappa isotype that directly blocks the interaction between Programmed Death -1 (PD-1) and its 
ligands, PD-L1 and PDL-2. This immune checkpoint blockade enhances functional activity of the target lymphocytes to facilitate an antitumor immune

7 response, leading to tumor regression and immune rejection of the tumor. 
Indications currently under investigation by the manufacturer of pembrolizum ab 
include non- small cell lung cancer  (NSCLC)  and glioblastoma. KeytrudaTM 
(Pembrolizumab ) has recently been approved (at a dose of 2 mg/kg IV every 3 
weeks)  in the United Stated for the treatment of patients with unresectable or 
metastatic melanoma and di sease progression following ipilumumab and, if 
BRAF V600 mutation positive, a BRAF inhibitor. Further development of pembrolizumab in non- metastatic melanoma is ongoing.  See section 5.1 and the 
latest pembrolizumab prescribing information and Investigator’s Brochure for detailed information.  
1.4.1 Pharmaceutical and Therapeutic Background 
The importance of intact immune surveillance in controlling outgrowth of 
neoplastic transformation has been known for decades.
23 Accumulating evidence 
shows a correlation between tumor- infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in cancer 
tissue and favorable prognosis in various malignancies.24-28  In particular, the 
presence of CD8+ T-cells and the ratio of CD8+ effector T -cells / FoxP3+ 
regulatory T-cells seems to correlate with improved prognosis and long- term 
survival in many solid tumors.  PD-1 receptor -ligand interaction is a major pathway hijacked by tumors to 
suppress immune control.  The normal function of PD-1, expressed on the cell surface of activated T -cells under healthy conditions, is to down-modulate 
unwanted or excessive immune responses, including autoimmune reactions.  PD-1 (encoded by the gene PDCD1) is an Ig superfamily member related to CD28 and 
CTLA -4 that has been shown to negatively regulate antigen receptor signaling 
upon engagement of its ligands (PD-L1 and/or PD- L2). 
29,30 PD-1 and family 
members are type I transmembrane glycoproteins containing an Ig Variable- type 
(V-type) domain responsible for ligand binding and a cytoplasmic tail which is 
responsible for the binding of signaling molecules.  The cytoplasmic tail of PD-1 contains 2 tyrosine- based signalin g motifs, an immunoreceptor tyrosine- based 
inhibition motif (ITIM) and an immunoreceptor tyrosine- based switch motif 
(ITSM).   
 Following T- cell stimulation, PD -1 recruits the tyrosine phosphatases SHP-1 and 
SHP-2 to the ITSM motif within its cytoplasmic tail, leading to the 
dephosphorylation of effector molecules such as CD3ζ, PKCθ and ZAP70, all of which are involved in the CD3 T- cell signaling cascade.
29,31-33 The mechanism by 
which PD-1 down modulates T- cell responses is similar to, but distinct from that 
of CTLA -4 as both molecules regulate an overlapping set of signaling proteins.34  
PD-1 is expressed on activated lymphocytes including peripheral CD4+ and CD8+ 
T-cells, B -cells, T regs and Natural Killer cells .35,36  Expression has also been 
shown during thymic development on CD4-CD8- (double negative) T- cells as well 
as subsets of macrophages and dendritic cells.37

9 1.4.3 Clinical Findings  
Pharmacokinetics and Dosing 
Pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters were assessed during an open -label phase I trial 
of pembrolizumab  ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) that evaluated three dose levels of 
monotherapy in patients with advanced solid tumors (1mg/kg, 3mg/kg, and 10mg/kg every 2 weeks). No dose- limiting toxicities (DLTs) were observed and 
all three dose levels were well -tolerated. This first in human study of 
pembrolizumab showed evidence of target engagement and objective evidence of tumor size reduction at all dose levels evaluated .  No maximally tolerated dose 
(MTD ) has been identified to date. 
 Two dose levels are being evaluated in several phase II or III trials in metastatic melanoma and NSCLC (2mg/kg and 10mg/kg every 3 weeks) ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED], 
NCT0 1905657) aft er initial data showed that every 2 week and 3 week dosing 
appeared equivalent. Based on these studies, it was determined that 2mg/kg and 10mg/kg dosing in melanoma had similar efficacy and safety with flat exposure-response relationships of pembrolizumab for efficacy and safety in the dose range of 2-10mg/kg q3weeks. In addition, there was no effect of tumor burden or 
disease indication on the distribution behavior of pembrolizumab as assessed by a population pharmacokinetic model. The half- life of pembrolizumab is estimated 
at 14 -21 days. 
 
A population pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis  of pembrolizumab has been 
performed using serum concentration time data from 476 patients. Within the resulting population PK model, clearance and volume parameters of pembrolizumab were found to be dependent on body weight. The relationship between clearance and body wei ght, with an allometric exponent of 0.59, is 
within the range observed for other antibodies and supports both body weight normalized dosing or a fixed dose across all body weights (Merck, written communication).    The choice of the 200 mg every 3 weeks  as an appropriate dose for the switch to 
fixed dosing of pembrolizumab (which is pending FDA approval, and which is incorporated into this study) is based on simulations performed using the population PK model of pembrolizumab showing that the fixed dose of 200 mg every 3 weeks will provide exposures that 1) are optimally consistent with those obtained with the 2 mg/kg dose every 3 weeks (the current FDA approved dose), 2) will maintain individual patient exposures in the exposure range established in melanoma as associated with maximal efficacy response and 3) will maintain individual patients exposure in the exposure range established in melanoma that are well tolerated and safe (Merck, written communication) .  The fixed dosing 
regimen will also reduce poten tial for dosing errors and reduce the complexity 
associated with weight -based dosing.  
 
Clinical Safety  
LCCC 1522  CONFIDENTIAL  
PI: Zeidner   UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA  
June 02, 2018   Amendment 07  
 
 
10 As of June 2017 pembrolizumab monotherapy and combination therapy have 
been administered to, 14,0444 subjects, with hematologic malignancies and solid 
tumors, in a total of 19 Phase I, II, and III clinical trials sponsored by Merck. Safety data are available for a total of 2799 subjects in 4 Merck -sponsored clinical 
trials. The majority of participants, 2727 or 97.4%, experienced 1 or more AE, and 2062 (73.7%) experienced 1 or more AE reported as drug- related by the 
investigator.  Various dose-schedules, including 10mg/kg administered IV over 30 minutes every 2 weeks, have been studied. The most commonly reported treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) experienced  in monotherapy trials 
are fatigue ( 37.3%), nausea (2 4.5%), decreased appetite (22.5%), cough (2 2.0%), 
pruritus (2 0.1%), dyspnea (19.1%), arthralgia (18.0%), diarrhea (22.3%) and rash 
(17.8%).   
 
1.5 Rationale for Pembrolizumab in AML  
Models of AML suggest that the PD- 1 pathway is exploited by leukemic cells to 
evade immune surveillance.
42-48 Tumor progression in a murine AML model was 
associated with up -regulation of PD-1 on CD8+ T cells and an increase in 
regulatory T cells (Tregs).42 These experiments further demonstrated that PD -1 
knockout mice had less leukemia burden and increased OS upon AML challenge compared to wild- type mice, despite the presence of a similar percentage of 
Tregs. Blockade of PD -L1, furthermore, led to an increase in proliferation of 
CD8
+ T cells specific for leukemic blasts and reduced leukemic burden.42 Thus, 
the interaction between PD -1 and PD- L1 can facilitate Treg -induced suppression 
of CD8+ effector T cells (Teff) and dampen the anti -tumor immun e response. In 
primary leukemia samples, PD -L1 was shown to be up-regulated on AML blasts 
(including de novo expression), more so at relapse than at diagnosis, and wa s 
induced by inflammatory molecules, such as IFN- γ and TNF- α.43,44 These data 
suggest that leukemia cells up -regulate expression of PD -L1 in the setting of 
inflammation, such as after receiving chemotherapy.  
 Up-regulation of PD-L1 and PD- L2 was also seen on leukemic cells after initial 
T-cell activation, which led to suppression of T helper response and cytokine production, with a resultant increase in Tregs. Blocking the PD-1 pathway on these leukemic cells with a PD-1-Ig fusion protein largely abolished this 
suppression. An intriguing phenomenon of “adaptive resistance” was seen in these experiments, whereby initial expression of co- stimulatory molecules on 
AML blasts, such as CD86 and ICOS ligand, led to specific T-cell expansion and activation. Leukemic cells in turn up- regulate PD -L1 and other co-inhibitory 
molecules and down- regulate co -stimulatory molecules in order to suppress 
subsequent T- cell activation.
46,47 This concept of adaptive resistance is also 
supported by data suggesting that the presence of co- stimulatory molecules such 
as CD -86 and ICOS ligand were associated with worse outcomes in AML, as T-
cell activation eventually contributes to induction of immune escape mechanisms (i.e., PD-1/PD-L1 and CTLA- 4).
48 Recently, Kronig et al.45 demonstrated that 
LCCC 1522  CONFIDENTIAL  
PI: Zeidner   UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA  
June 02, 2018   Amendment 07  
 
 
11 IFN- γ induced PD-L1 expression in AML patients in CR and relapse more so 
than at initial diagnosis. The increased PD-L1 expression observed in these 
patients was due to both up-regulation as well as de novo expression on previously PD-L1 negative precursor cells. These data further support the concept of adaptive resistance in AML, whereby tumor cells utilize the PD -1/PD- L1 
pathway for tissue protection in light of an ongoing anti- tumor immune 
response.
45-48   
1.6 Rationale for HiDAC Salvage Chemotherapy Followed by Pembrolizu mab  
There is no accepted standard chemotherapeutic regimen for patients with relapsed or refractory AML. High doses of cytarabine (1- 3 gm/m
2) have been 
shown to be effective in induction, consolidation, and the treatment of relapsed and refractory disease.
8,12,49 The MTD  of cytarabine is 3 gm/m2 administered 
every 12 hours for up to 12 doses.8 However,  3 gm/m2 increases the risk for 
cerebellar toxicities (as outlined earlier), conjunctival toxicities, and prolonged 
myelosuppression. Further, patients >60 years appear to have heightened toxicity with HiDAC with increased rates of cerebellar toxicity.
12 It is also unclear 
whether 3 gm/m2 is superior to moderate doses (i.e., 1- 2 gm/m2) of cytarabine , the 
latter doses which have been investigated in combination with other chemotherapy agents . Based on these considerations, we plan to administer age -
adjusted HiDAC (age <60 years: 2 gm/m
2 IV Q12hours days 1-5 for a total of 10 
doses; age >60 years: 1.5 gm/m2 IV Q12hours days 1-5 for a total of 10 doses) to 
minimize toxicities at the time of pembrolizumab administration on day 14.  
Invest igational agents and regimens remain the priority in relapsed and refractory 
AML.21,22 Chemotherapy is hypothesized to exacerbate immune exhaustion in 
tumor cells.50 HiDAC provides an effective anti -leukemic cytotoxic effect, but 
response rates are low and not durable ( see section 1.3). Pembrolizumab will be 
administered on day 14, 9 days after the completion of HiDAC chemotherapy, while patients are still aplastic.  
 The common toxicities of pembrolizumab outlined in section 1.4.3 do not overlap 
with the major toxicities of cytarabine, and the mechanism of action of each is 
unique. Therefore, we expect no more than additive toxicit y.  Further, 
pembrolizumab administration will not be given concomitantly with cytarabine, 
but on day 14, 9 days after cytarabine therapy is completed.  Additionally, 
delaying pembrolizumab until day 14 should theoretically  create a maximally 
exhausted immune state in leukemia cells due to “adaptive resistance” after chemotherapy ( see sect ion 1.5). Patients who achieve a response (i.e., 
PR/CR/CRi) to the induction phase will receive pembrolizumab 200 mg IV Q3weeks maintenance treatment  to prevent or delay relapse from occurring by 
potentially  creating  a long -lasting anti- leukemic immune effect.  
 In this trial, toxicity will be monitored continuously, with sequential b oundaries 
employed to suspend the trial if excessive toxicity is seen. If the  study reaches a 
stopping boundary, it may be terminated by the PI , or submitted to the Data and 
LCCC 1522  CONFIDENTIAL  
PI: Zeidner   UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA  
June 02, 2018   Amendment 07  
 
 
12 Safety Monitoring Committee ( DSMC ) with a des cription of the toxicities  and a 
rationale for why the study should be discontinued.   
1.7 Correlative Studies  
We will be conducting a comprehensive, multifaceted correlative approach to 
evaluate leukemic cells and host immune responses before and after pembrolizumab treatment. The overarchin g goals of these correlative studies are: 
1) to identify and characterize mechanisms involved in T cell dysfunction in 
AML, 2) to identify potential predictive biomarker candidates to allow better 
selection of  AML  patients who may benefit from pembrolizumab, 3) to identify 
new pathways that could be targeted to enhance the efficacy of pembrolizumab in 
AML , and 4) to assess for minimal residual disease after pembrolizumab . To 
accomplish these goals, we will perform Multiplex next generation sequencing of DNA and RNA from tumor cells, comprehensive kinome analyses to seek predictors of pembrolizumab activity, epigenetic studies of T cells via ChIP sequencing, multi-color flow cytometric analyses of immune markers pre and post- pembrolizumab to determine markers  of activity, and high-throughput DNA 
sequencing of T cell receptors IGH loci to determine T cell receptor repertoire and diversity in AML before and after pembrolizumab treatment.  
 We hypothesize that response to pembrolizumab will be associated with: 1)  
increased mRNA expression of PD -L1, 2) increased expression of general 
immune gene signatures associated with immune regulation, 3) clonal restriction in T- cell receptor (TCR) and B -cell receptor (BCR) repertoires, 4) increased 
tumor infiltration with eff ector cells of multiple lineages, 5) decreased tumor 
infiltration by regulatory cells of multiple lineages . 
 Some or all of these correlative studies may be conducted under the auspices of the UNC Master Biomarker Protocol for Pembrolizumab Studies (PI: Jonathan Serody, MD UNC), currently under final review for funding.  All patients will have pre - and post-treatment tumor tissue (i.e., bone marrow 
biopsies) as well as serial blood samples submitted for correlative studies  to 
determine the dynamic nature of  immune signatures pre and post- pembrolizumab .

19 4.0 TREATMENT PLAN  
4.1 Schema  
This is a phase 2, open-label, multicenter, single -arm study evaluating HiDAC 
salvage induction chemotherapy followed by pembrolizumab in the 
relapsed/refractory AML settin g. Toxicity will be assessed during treatment via 
NCI CTCAE v4.0. Tumor specimens from a pre-study bone marrow biopsy and post-treatment bone marrow biops ies as well as serial blood samples will be 
collected for correlative studies.  
 Pembrolizumab 200 mg is administered IV once as monotherapy, 14 days after the initiation of HiDAC salvage induction chemotherapy. Patients who have a response (i.e., PR/CR/CRi) to induction phase will receive maintenance pembrolizumab at 200 mg IV every 3 weeks for up to 2- years of maintenance 
therapy  (i.e., beginning on day 1 of maintenance) .   
4.2 Induction Phase  
Treatment will be administered as an inpatient. Patients will be discharged from the inpatient unit after receiving pembrolizumab per institutional standards . All 
patients will receive standard high dose cytarabine (HiDAC) for salvage induction therapy dose-adjusted for age. Patients <60 years will receive HiDAC 2 gm/m
2 IV 
Q12hours days 1- 5 while patients >60 years will receive HiDAC 1.5 gm/m2 IV 
Q12hours days 1-5. Pembrolizumab will be administered as a fixed dose of 200 
mg IV on day 14. Prior to pembrolizumab administration, patients must continue to meet eligibility for laboratory parameters  as outlined in section 
3.1. If 

LCCC 1522  CONFIDENTIAL  
PI: Zeidner   UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA

20 laboratory abnormalities exist on day 14, (or any patient with uncontrolled 
intercurrent illness or other abnormalities deemed by the PI to be unsafe to administer pembrolizumab), pembrolizumab administration can be delayed for 1 week, up to day 21, provided laboratory abnormalities  correct themselves to 
levels defined in section 3.1
 with su pportive care. Patients who are ineligible for 
pembrolizumab administration by day 21 will be removed from the study and replaced by another subject. A disease assessment with a bone marrow biopsy will occur after patients have achieved full hematologic re covery as per standard 
of care, defined as absolute neutrophil count >1,000/mcL and platelet count 
>100,000/mcL. If full hematologic recovery does not occur by day 45 +/- 2 days, 
a bone marrow biopsy will take place regardles s. Patients without evidence of 
active leukemia on disease assessment but with out full hematologic recovery by 
day 45 +/-2 days will require a repeat bone marrow biopsy upon full hematologic 
recovery.  Patients who achieve a CRi, will be followed with serial blood counts 
(weekly) for up to 30 days after bone marrow biopsy post-induction is performed. 
Those who achieve subsequent full hematologic recovery (within 30 days of CRi) will require an additional bone marrow biopsy to document full CR status. If they 
do not achieve full hematologic recovery within 30 days, they will remain designated as a CRi.  Patients who have achieved a PR, CR or CRi will receive 
maintenance pembr olizumab  (see section 
4.3). Please see section 6.9 for response 
definitions.

 Cerebellar exams should be performed prior to each dose of cytarabine. Any new symptoms suggestive of cerebellar toxicity should result in temporary discontinuation of cytarabine until symptoms resolve, as per institutional policy.  
4.2.2 Pembrolizumab  
All patients will receive pembrolizumab 200 mg IV for 1 dose on day 14 of therapy , as long as they have received >50% of planned doses of cytarabine (see 
4.2.1). Pembroli zumab will be administered as a  30 minute IV infusion. Sites 
should make every effort to target infusion timing to be as close to 30 minutes as possible.  However, given the variability of infusion pumps from site to site, a window of -5 minutes and +10 minutes is permitted (i.e., infusion time is 30 minutes: -5 min/+10 min).  The Pharmacy Manual contains specific instructions 
for the preparation of the pembrolizumab infusion fluid and administration of infusion solution. This manual is provided as a document separate from the protocol.  Management of Infusion Reactions : Signs and symptoms usually develop 
during or shortly after drug infusion and generally resolve completely within 24 hours of completion of infusion.  Refer to the table below for infusion reaction treatment guidelines:

4.2.2.1 Contraception  
Pembrolizumab may have adverse effects on a fetus in utero.  Furthermore, it is 
not known if pembrolizumab has transient adverse effects on the composition of sperm.  For this trial, male subjects will be considered to be of non-reproductive 
potential if they have azoospermia (whether due to having had a vasectomy or due to an underlying medical condition).    Female subjects will be considered of non-reproductive potential if they are either:  
LCCC 1522  CONFIDENTIAL  
PI: Zeidner   UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA  
June 02, 2018   Amendment 07  
 
 
23 (1) postmenopausal (defined as at least 12 months with no menses without an 
alternative medical cause; in women < 45 years of age a high follicle 
stimulating hormone (FSH) level in the postmenopausal range may be used to confirm a post-menopausal state in women not using hormonal contraception or hormonal replacement therapy. In the absence of 12 months of amenorrhea, a single FSH measurement is insufficient.);  
OR 
(2) have had a hysterectomy and/or bilateral oophorectomy, bilateral 
salpingectomy or bilateral tubal ligation/occlusion, at least 6 weeks prior to screenin g;  
OR 
(3) have a congenital or acquired condition that prevents childbearing.  Female and male subjects of reproductive potential must agree to avoid becoming pregnant or impregnating a partner, respectively, while receiving study drug and for 120 days after the last dose of study drug by complying with one of the following:  
  (1) practice abstinence
† from heterosexual activity;  
OR 
(2) use (or have their partner use) acceptable contraception during heterosexual 
activity.   
 Acceptable methods of contraception are
‡: 
 Single method (one of the following is acceptable): 
• intrauterine device (IUD)  
• vasectomy of a female subject’s male partner  
• contraceptive rod implanted into the skin  
Combination method (requires use of two of the following): 
• diaphragm with spermicide (cannot be used in conjunction with cervical 
cap/spermicide)  
• cervical cap with spermicide (nulliparous women only)   • contraceptive sponge (nulliparous women only)  • male condom or female condom (cannot be used toge ther)  
• hormonal contraceptive: oral contraceptive pill ( estrogen /progestin pill or 
progestin-only pill), contraceptive skin patch, vaginal contraceptive ring, or subcutaneous contraceptive injection  
 
†Abstinence (relative to heterosexual activity) can be used as the sole method of 
contraception if it is consistently employed as the subject’s preferred and usual lifestyle and if considered acceptable by local regulatory agencies and ERCs/IRBs.  Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, sympto- thermal,  
LCCC 1522  CONFIDENTIAL  
PI: Zeidner   UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA  
June 02, 2018   Amendment 07  
 
 
24 post-ovulation methods, etc.) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of 
contraception.    ‡If a contraceptive method listed above is restricted by local regulations/guidelines, then it does not qualify as an acceptable method of contraception for subje cts participating at sites in this country/region.  
 Subjects should be informed that taking the study medication may involve unknown risks to the fetus (unborn baby) if pregnancy were to occur during the study.  In order to participate in the study subjects of childbearing potential must adhere to the contraception requirement (described above) from  the day of study 
medication initiation (or 14 days prior to the initiation of study medication for oral contraception) throughout the study period up to 120 days after the last dose 
of trial therapy.   If there is any question that a subject  of childbearing potential 
will not reliably comply with the requirements for contraception, that subject should not be entered into the study. 
4.3 Maintenance Phase  
Patients who achieve a PR, CR, or CRi (see section 6.9
) will receive 
pembrolizumab 200 mg IV Q3weeks on an outpatient basis. In order to qualify for pembrolizumab maintenance, all patients will be required to meet laboratory eligibility criteria as outlined in Section 3.1.7 and prior drug- related toxicities 
must have resolved to < grade 1  or baselin e. Any patient experiencing  
unacceptable toxicity during induction, as defined in section 2.4.2 , will not be 
eligible for maintenance , but will be discontinued from protocol- directed therapy 
and followed-up per protocol. In those who have achieved a CR or PR, pembrolizumab maintenance will begin 10 -60 days followi ng full hematologic 
recovery (absolute neutrophil count >1,000/mcL and platelet count 
>100,000/mcL). Patients who achieve CRi will begin maintenance 
pembrolizumab 10-60 days following a bone marrow biopsy disease assessment after induction phase (a repeat bone marrow biopsy should be performed if CRi 
patients subsequently achieve full hematologic recovery prior to pembrolizumab maintenance, as detailed in Section 4.2: Induction Phase) . Patients eligible to 
receive maintenance therapy should begin maintenance as early as possible ( >10 
days after hematologic recovery occurs, and once recovery from drug- related 
toxicities <grade 1 or baseline). Those who  do not receive maintenance therapy 
by day 60 of hematologic recovery or by day 60 of post-induction bone mar row 
biopsy in CRi patients will be taken  off study protocol.  
 All patients who continue pembrolizumab maintenance therapy will have disease assessments with bone marrow biopsies after every 4 cycles of treatment (i.e., every 12 weeks)  for the fi rst year, and then after every 6 cy cles of treatment (i.e. 
every 18  weeks) during years 1 -2. If there is suspicion for disease progression, a 
disease assessment via bone marrow biopsy will occur at any time during the 
maintenance phase. Patients will continue pembrolizumab 200 mg IV Q3weeks 
LCCC 1522  CONFIDENTIAL  
PI: Zeidner   UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA  
June 02, 2018   Amendment 07  
 
 
25 for up to 2 years (i.e., 34 cycles of treatment)  until disease progression, 
unacceptable toxicity, receipt of allogeneic stem cell transplantation or 
investigator and/or patient chooses to discontinue treatment.  
 
Patients will be  eligible to undergo an allogeneic stem cell transplantation after 
induction phase. Pembrolizumab maintenance can be continued prior to an allogeneic stem cell transplant. The allogeneic stem cell infusion day 0 should occur >21 days after the last infusio n of pembrolizumab.  
4.3.1 Toxicities and Dose Modifications for Pembrolizumab Maintenance  
Adverse events (both non- seriou s and serious) associated with pembrolizumab 
exposure may represent an immunologic etiology.  These adverse events may occur shortly after t he first dose or several months after the last dose of treatment. 
Pembrolizumab must be withheld for drug- related toxicities and severe or life-
threatening AEs as per Table 3  below. See section  4.4 for supportive care 
guidelines, including use of corticosteroids. 
 
Dosing interruptions are permitted in the case of medical / surgica l events or 
logistical reasons not related to study therapy (e.g., elective surgery, unrelated 
medical events, patient vacation, and/or holidays). Subjects should be placed back on study therapy within 3 weeks of the scheduled interruption, unless otherwise discussed with the Sponsor. The reason for interruption should be documented in the patient's study record.  
 If a dose of pembrolizumab  is delayed, then the subsequent dose should be 
administered 3 weeks later.   Patients may receive up to 1 year of treatment with 
pembrolizumab beginning on day 1 of maintenance therapy. In the event of dose delays/interruptions, subjects may not receive more than 1 total year of treatment beginning with day 1 of maintenance thera py.  
  
Table 3. Dose Modifications 
General instructions:  
1. Corticosteroid taper should be initiated upon AE improving to Grade 1 or less and continue to 
taper over at least 4 weeks.  
2. For situations where pembrolizumab has been withheld, pembrolizumab can be resumed after AE 
has been reduced to Grade 1 or 0 and corticosteroid has been tapered. Pembrolizumab should be 
permanently discontinued if AE does not resolve within 12 weeks of last dose or corticosteroids 
cannot be reduced to ≤10 mg prednisone or equivalent per day within 12 weeks.  
3. For severe and life -threatening irAEs, IV corticosteroid should be initiated first followed by oral 
steroid. Other immunosuppressive treatment should be initiated if irAEs cannot be controlled by 
corticosteroids.

4.4 Rescue Medications & Supportive Care  
4.4.1 Cytarabine- related Kerato -conjunctivitis  
To prevent cytarabine- related kerato -conjunctivitis, dexamethasone 0.1% 
ophthalmic eye drops (or per institutional formulary) must begin at least 1 hour 
prior to cytarabine initiation. Eye drops should be performed every 6 hours to both eyes until day 12 of induction phase treatment.  
4.4.2 Anti emetics  
Antiemetics will be used according to standard practices  with the exception of 
systemic steroids (i.e., dexamethasone) . Use of systemic steroids during this trial 
is not allowed . Any 5 -hydroxytryptamine (5- HT3) rec eptor inhibitor (e.g., 
LCCC 1522  CONFIDENTIAL  
PI: Zeidner   UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA  
June 02, 2018   Amendment 07  
 
 
29 ondansetron) combined with haloperidol or prochlorperazine as needed, will be 
used during chemotherapy infusions and during pembrolizumab administration, as needed.  
4.4.3 Antimicrobial prophylaxis  
Patients will receive prophylaxis against gram -negative gastrointestinal infections 
(GI), candidiasis, and herpes simplex virus (HSV), while patients are aplastic, during induction phase, and as per standard of care. Antimicrobial prophylaxis will only occur in the maintenance phase if patients d evelop neutropenia (absolute 
neutrophil count <500/mcL).  
4.4.4 Colony Stimulating Factors 
The routine use of colony stimulating factors is not allowed. The use of colony 
stimulating factors in the presence of severe or life -threatening infection should 
be discu ssed with the principal investigator before implementation.  
4.4.5 Prevention and Management of Tumor Lysis Syndrome (TLS) 
Tumor lysis occurs as part of initial cytoreductive therapy. In its  most extreme 
form, TLS, is characterized by hyperuricemia, hyperphosphatemia, increased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), coagulopathy, and a potential cytokine release syndrome.   Tumor lysis labs consisting of basic metabolic panel, uric acid, calcium, and phosphate must be drawn a minimum of twice daily at least through day 5 of  
chemotherapy and once daily through day 10, until maximum tumor lysis has abated. The following precautionary and prophylaxis regimens are suggested prior to and during initial chemotherapy administration: 
• To prevent hyperuricemia, all patients with out known allergy will receive 
allopurinol 300-600 mg PO qday 24 hours prior to beginning chemotherapy and the allopurinol 300-600 mg PO qday continuing through the period of maximal tumor lysis (at least through day 8) or other antiuricemia regimen per institutional practice. Rasburicase may be used per institutional policy for hyperuricemia. Screening for G6PD deficiency should be obtained in susceptible populations before beginning r asburicase.  
• To decrease the risk of hyperphosphatemia, an oral phosphate binde r per 
institutional practice (e.g . sevelamer 400 -800 mg) will be administered orally 
every  8 hours beginning on day 1 of induction phase and continued as 
tolerated until maximum tumor lysis has occurred (at least day  8). 
• Cytokine release syndrome can occu r shortly after completion of drug 
infusion, accompany severe TLS, and present with fever, bronchospasm with dyspnea and/or respiratory distress, altered blood pressure, myalgias, arthralgias, tumor pain and/or urticarial rash. Any patient with cytokine release syndrome should receive 20 mg dexamethasone (or equivalent steroid) 
IV immediately. Pembrolizumab must begin at least 7 days after the last dose

4.4.6 Rescue Medications & Supportive Care for Pembrolizumab Cycles  
Supportive Care Guidelines  
Subjects should receive appropriate supportive care measures as deemed 
necessary by the treating investigator.  Suggested supportive care measures for the management of adverse events with potential immunologic etiology are outlined 
below.  Where appropriate, these guidelines include the use of oral or intravenous treatment with corticosteroids as well as additional anti- inflammatory agents if 
symptoms do not improve with administration of corticosteroids.   Note that several  courses of steroid tapering may be necessary as symptoms may worsen 
when the steroid dose is decreased. For each disorder, attempts should be made to rule out other causes such as metastatic disease or bacterial or viral infection, which might require additional supportive care. The treatment guidelines are intended to be applied when the investigator determines the events to be related to pembrolizumab.   Note:  if after the evaluation the event is determined not to be related, the 
investigator does not ne ed to follow the treatment guidance (as outlined in  below ).  
 It may be necessary to perform conditional procedures such as bronchoscopy, endoscopy, or skin photography as part of evaluation of the event.  
 
Pneumonitis:  
o For Grade 2 events , treat with systemic corticosteroids. When symptoms 
improve to Grade 1 or less, steroid taper should be started and continued over no less than 4 weeks. 
o For Grade 3 -4 events , immediately treat with intravenous steroids.  
Administer additional anti- inflammatory measure s, as needed.  
o Add prophylactic antibiotics for opportunistic infections in the case of prolonged steroid administration.

31 Diarrhea/Colitis:  
Subject s should be carefully monitored for signs and symptoms of enterocolitis 
(such as diarrhea, abdominal pain, blood or mucus in stool, with or without fever) 
and of bowel perforation (such as peritoneal signs and ileus).   
o All subject s who experience diarrhea/colitis  should be advised to drink 
liberal quantities of clear fluids.  If sufficient oral fluid intake is not feasible, fluid and electrolytes should be substituted via IV infusion.  For Grade 2 or higher diarrhea, consider GI consultation and endoscopy to confirm or rule out colitis.  
o For Grade 2 diarrhea/colitis , administer oral corticosteroids.  
o For Grade  3 or 4 diarrhea/colitis , treat with intravenous steroids followed 
by high dose oral steroids.   
o When symptoms improve to Grade 1 or less, steroid taper should be started and continued over no less than 4 weeks. 
 
Type 1 diabetes mellitus (TIDM) (if new onset, including diabetic 
ketoacidosis [DKA]) or ≥ Grade 3 Hyperglycemia, if associated with ketosis 
(ketonuria) or metabolic acidosis (DKA) 
 
o For T1DM  or Grade 3 -4 Hyperglycemia  
 Insulin replacement therapy is recommended for Type I diabetes mellitus and fo r Grade 3 -4 hyperglycemia associated with metabolic 
acidosis or ketonuria.  
 Evaluate patients with serum glucose and a metabolic panel, urine ketones, glycosylated hemoglobin, and C-peptide.  
 
• Hypophysitis : 
o For Grade 2  events, treat with corticosteroids. When symptoms improve to 
Grade 1 or less, steroid taper should be started and continued over no less than 4 weeks. Replacement of appropriate hormones may be required as the steroid dose is tapered. 
o For Grade 3 -4 events, treat with an initial dose of IV cor ticosteroids 
followed by oral corticosteroids. When symptoms improve to Grade 1 or less, steroid taper should be started and continued over no less than 4 weeks. Replacement of appropriate hormones may be required as the steroid dose is tapered.  
Hyperthyro idism or Hypothyroidism :  
Thyroid disorders can occur at any time during treatment; monitor patients for changes in thyroid function (at the start of treatment, periodically during 
LCCC 1522  CONFIDENTIAL

32 treatment, and as indicated based on clinical evaluation) and for clinical signs and 
symptoms of thyroid disorders. 
 Grade 2  hyperthyroidism events (and Grade 2 -4 hypothyroidism): 
 In hyperthyroidism, non -selective beta- blockers (e.g. propranolol) 
are suggested as initial therapy.  
 In hypothyroidism, thyroid hormone replacement the rapy, with 
levothyroxine or liothyroinine, is indicated per standard of care. 
 Grade 3 -4 hyperthyroidism  
 Treat with an initial dose of IV corticosteroid followed by oral corticosteroids. When symptoms improve to Grade 1 or less, steroid taper should be started and continued over no less than 4 weeks. Replacement of appropriate hormones may be required as the steroid dose is tapered. 
 
Hepatic : 
o For Grade 2  events, monitor liver function tests more frequently until 
returned to baseline values (consider weekly).  
 Treat with IV or oral corticosteroids  
o For Grade 3 -4 events, treat with intravenous corticosteroids for 24 to 48 
hours.  
o When symptoms improve to Grade 1 or less, a steroid taper should be started and continued over no less than 4 weeks. 
 
Renal  Failure or Nephritis:  
o For Grade 2  events, treat with corticosteroids . 
o For Grade 3 -4 events, treat with systemic corticosteroids . 
o When symptoms improve to Grade 1 or less, steroid taper should be started 
and continued over no less than 4 weeks.  
• Management of Infusion Reactions : Signs and symptoms usually develop during 
or shortly after drug infusion and generally resolve completely within 24 hours of completion of infusion.  
Section 4.2.2 shows treatment guidelines for subjects who experience an infusion 
reaction associated with administration of pembrolizumab ( MK-3475). 
 
Steven’s Johnson Syndrome (SJS) and Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis (TEN) 
o For signs and symptoms of SJS or TEN, withhold pembrolizumab and refer 
the patient for specialized care for assessment and treatment  
o If SJS or TEN is confirmed, permanently discontinue pembrolizumab

See section  4.2.2. 
4.5 Concomitant Medications/Vaccinations (allowed & prohibited)  
Medications or vaccinations specifically prohibited in the exclusion criteria are 
not allowed during the ongoing trial.  If there is a clinical indication for one of these or other medications or vaccinations specifically prohibited during the trial, discontinuation from trial therapy or vaccination may be required.  The investigator should discuss any questions regarding this with the Merck Clinical team.  The final decision on any supportive therapy or vaccination rests with the investigator and/or the subject's primary physician  
4.5.1 Acceptable Concomitant Medications  
All treatments that the investigator considers necessary for a subject’s welfare may 
be administered at the discretion of the investigator in keeping with the community standards of medical care. All concomitant medication will be recorded on the case report form (CRF) including all prescription, over the counter (OTC), herbal supplements, and IV medications and fluids. If changes occur during the trial period, documentation of drug dosage, frequency, route, and date may also be included on the CRF. 
All concomitant medications received within 28 days before the first d ose of trial 
treatment and 30 days after the last dose of trial treatment should be recorded.  
Concomitant medications administered after 30 days after the last dose of trial treatment should be recorded for SAEs and ECIs as defined in Section 7.2.  
4.5.2 Prohib ited Concomitant Medications  
Subjects are prohibited from receiving the following therapies during the Screening and Treatment Phase  
 
• Anti-cancer systemic chemotherapy or biological therapy  with the exception 
of hydroxyurea  and intrathecal chemotherapy (c ytarabine and/or 
methotrexate) for CNS disease. Intrathecal chemotherapy will be permissible 
on maintenance phase of the protocol as long as the subject is continuing to have a clinical response to treatment. This should be discussed with the PI prior to a dministering intrathecal chemotherapy. Intrathecal chemotherapy 
should be administered at least 72 hours before/after pembrolizumab infusion. 
• Immunotherapy not specified in this protocol 
• Chemotherapy not specified in this protocol 
• Investigational agents other than pembrolizumab  
LCCC 1522  CONFIDENTIAL  
PI: Zeidner   UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA  
June 02, 2018   Amendment 07  
 
 
34 • Live vaccines within 30 days prior to the first dose of trial treatment and while 
participating in the trial.   Examples of live vaccines include, but are not limited 
to, the following: measles, mumps, rubella, chicken pox, yellow fever, rabies, 
BCG, and typhoid (oral) vaccine. Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally killed virus vaccines and are allowed; however intranasal influenza vaccines (e.g. Flu -Mist®) are live attenuated vaccines, and are not allowed.  
• Systemic Corticosteroids  for any purpose other than to modulate symptoms 
from an event of clinical interest of suspected immunologic etiology.  The use of physiologic doses of corticosteroids may be approved after consultation with the Sponsor.  
• Radiation therapy  
• Growth factor support (G- CSF or GM -CSF)  
 Subjects who, in the assessment by the investigator, require the use of any of the aforementioned treatments for clinical management should be removed from the trial.  Subjects may receive other medications that the investigator deems to be 
medically necessary  
4.6 Duration of Therapy 
In the absence of treatment delays due to adverse event(s), treatment may 
continue until one of the following criteria applies: 
• Failure to achieve a PR, CR, or CRi after induction phase  
• Disease progression/relapse at any time during induction or maintenance phase 
• Receipt of allogeneic stem cell transplantation  
• Completion of 2 years of pembrolizumab maintenance therapy 
• Intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of treatment  
• Unacceptable adverse event(s)  while on pembrolizumab therapy as 
defined in section 2.4.2  
• Patient de cides to withdraw from study  
• Patient unable to comply with  protocol requirements 
• General or specific changes in the patient’s condition that render the patient unacceptable for further treatment in the judgment of the investigator.  
4.7 Duration of Follow- Up 
Patients will be followed for up to 5 years  after removal from study treatment or 
until death, whichever occurs first. Patients removed from study for unacceptable adverse events will be followed until resolution or stabilization of the adverse event .  After 2 years of follow -up as described in the time and event s table, 
subsequent follow-up will be per standard of care and the study will follow only for progression and for survival for up to 3 additional years, for a total of 5 years of follow-up after study completion.

35 4.8 Removal of Patients from Protocol Therapy 
Patients will be removed from protocol therapy and the PI notified when any of 
the criteria listed in section  4.6 apply.  Patients will also be removed from 
protocol therapy if they f ail to meet eligibility criteria for the first dose of 
pembrolizumab following HiDAC induction (see section 4.2). T he reason for 
discontinuation of protocol therapy will be documented on the eCRF.    In case a patient decides to prematur ely discontinue protocol therapy (“refuses  
treatment”), the patient should be asked if she or he may still be contacted for further scheduled study assessments. The outcome of that discussion should be documented in both the medical records and in the eCRF. 
4.9 Patient Replacement  
If laboratory abnormalities exist on day 14 during induction, pembrolizumab administration can be delayed for 1 week, up to day 21, provided laboratory abnormalities correct themselves to levels defined in section 3.1 with supportive 
care. Patients who are ineligible for pembrolizumab administration by day 21 will be removed from the study and replaced by another subject. 
4.10 Study Withdrawal  
If a subject  decides to withdraw  from the study (and not just from protocol 
therapy)  an effort should be made to complete and report study assessments as 
thoroughly as possible.  At the time of withdrawal, the investigator should attempt 
to establish as completely as  possible the reason for the study withdrawal.  
• The subject  should be asked if they are willing to allow for the abstraction 
of relevant information from their medical record in order to meet the long term follow up (e.g., survival) objectives outlined in the protocol.   
• A complete final evaluation at the time of the subject ’s study withdrawal 
should be obtained with an explanation of why the subject  is withdrawing 
from the study.   
• If the subject  is noncompliant and does not return for an end of study 
follow up assessment, this should be documented in the eCRF.  
• If the reason for removal of a subject  from the study is an adverse event, 
the principal specific event will be recorded on the eCRF.  
 Excessive subject withdrawals  from p rotocol therapy or from the study can render 
the study un- interpretable; therefore, unnecessary withdrawal of  subjects should 
be avoided.

5.1.6 Adverse Events Associated with Pembrolizumab  
The m ost common adverse reactions (reported in ≥20% of patients in clinical 
trials of pembrolizumab ) included fatigue, cough, nausea, pruritus, rash, 
decreased appetite, constipation, arthralgia, and diarrhea.  
 The following warnings are associated with the use of pembrolizumab:  
  
 Immune- Mediated Pneumonitis  
Pneumonitis occurred in ~3% of melanoma patients treated in clinical trials of pembrolizumab. The median time to development of pneumonitis was 5 months with a median duration of 4.9 months.  The one patient with Grade 3 pneumonitis required initial treatment with high -dose systemic corticosteroids (greater than or  
equal to 40 mg prednisone or equivalent per day) followed by a corticosteroid taper.Pneumonitis completely resolved in seven of the nine patients with Grade 2 -3 pneumonitis. 
 
Immune- Mediated Colitis  
Colitis (including microscopic colitis) occurred 1% of melanoma patients treated 
in clinical trials of pembrolizumab. The median time to onset of was 6.5 months with a median duration of 2.6 months. All three patients with Grade 2 or 3 colitis were treated with high -dose corticosteroids (greater than or equal to 40 mg 
prednisone or equivalent per day).  
Immune- Mediated Hepatitis  
Hepatitis (including autoimmune hepatitis) occurred in 0.5% of melanoma 
patients treated in clinical trials of pembrolizumab. The time to onset was 22 days 
for the case of Grade 4 hepatitis which lasted 1.1 months. The patient with Grade 
4 hepatitis permanently discontinued pembrolizumab and was treated with high -
dose (greater than or equal to 40 mg prednisone or equivalent per day) systemic corticosteroids followed by a corticosteroid taper. Both patients with hepatitis experienced complete resolution of the event.   
Immune- Mediated Hypophysitis   
Hypophysitis occurred in 0.5% of melanoma patients treated in clinical trials of pembrolizumab. The time to onset was 1.7 months for the patient with Grade 4 hypophysitis and 1.3 months for the patient with Grade 2 hypophysitis. Both patients were treated with high -dose (greater than or equal to 40 mg prednisone or 
equivalent per day) corticosteroids followed by a corticosteroid taper and remain ed on a physiologic replacement dose.  
 
Renal Failure and Immune- Mediated Nephritis   
LCCC 1522  CONFIDENTIAL  
PI: Zeidner   UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA  
June 02, 2018   Amendment 07  
 
 
38 Nephritis occurred in 3 (0.7%) patients of melanoma patients treated in clinical 
trials of pembrolizumab , consisting of one case of Grade 2 autoimmune nephritis 
(0.2%) and two cases of interstitial nephritis with renal failure (0.5%), one Grade 3 and one Grade 4. The time to onset of autoimmune nephritis was 11.6 months after the first dose of pembrolizumab (5 months after the last dose) and lasted 3.2 months; this patient did not have a biopsy. Acute interstitial nephritis was 
confirmed by renal biopsy in two patients with Grades 3- 4 renal failure. All three 
patients fully recovered renal function with treatment with high -dose 
corticosteroids (greater than or equal to 40 mg prednisone or equivalent per day) followed by a corticosteroid taper . 
 
Immune- Mediated Hyperthyroidi sm  
Hyperthyroidism occurred in 5 (1.2%) of 411 melanoma patients treated in clinical trials of pembrolizumab. The median time to onset was1.5 months and the median duration was 2.8 months (range 0.9 to 6.1). One of two patients with Grade 2 and the one patient with Grade 3 hyperthyroidism required initial treatment with high -dose corticosteroids (greater than or equal to 40 mg 
prednisone or equivalent per day) followed by a corticosteroid taper. One patient (0.2%) required permanent discontinuation of pembrolizumab due to hyperthyroidism. All five patients with hyperthyroidism experienced complete resolution of the event.  
Immune- Mediated Hypo thyroidi sm  
Hypothyroidism occurred in 34 (8.3%) of 411 melanoma patients treated in 
clinical trials of pembrolizumab. The median time to onset of hypothyroidism was 3.5 months. All but two of the patients with hypothyroidism were treated with long-term thyroidhormone replacement therapy. The other two patients only required short- term thyroid hormone replacement therapy. No patient received 
corticosteroids or discontinued pembrolizumab for management of hypothyroidism.Thyroid disorders can occur at any time during treatment.   
Other Immune -Mediated Adverse Reactions  
Other clinically important immune -mediated adverse reactions can occur. The 
following clinically significant, immune -mediated adverse reactions occurred in 
less than 1% of patients treated with pembrolizumab, including exfoliative dermatitis, uveitis, arthritis, myositis, pancreatitis, hemolytic anemia, partial seizures arising in a patient with inflammatory foci in brain parenchyma, and  
adrenal insufficiency.  
 Across clinical studies with pembrolizumab in app roximately 2000 patients, the 
following additional clinically significant, immune -mediated adverse reactions 
were reported in less than 1% of patients: myasthenic syndrome, optic neuritis, and rhabdomyolysis.

39 Embryofetal Toxicity  
Based on its mechanism of action, pembrolizumab may cause fetal harm when 
administered to a pregnant woman. Animal models link the PD-1/PDL-1 signaling pathway with maintenance of pregnancy through induction of maternal immune tolerance to fetal tissue.  
 
Steven’s Johnson Syndrome (SJS) and Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis (TEN) 
The risk of SJS and TEN is reported at approximately 0.4 – 7 cases per million patient years in the general adult population. Independent risk factors include certain medications such as anticonvulsants, sulfonamides, aminopenicillins, 
allopurinol, and NSAIDs. Non-medication triggers include infection, contrast media, and vaccinations. Malignancy is associated with an increased mortality rate in patients with SJS and TEN.  
 
Myocarditis  
A total of 6 cases of myocarditis have been reported in patients treated with 
pembrolizumab in clinical trials in an expanded access program. There was one fatal case reported in a clinical trial.  Immune -mediated myocarditis should be 
suspected if other causes of myocarditis such as infection or prior radiation therapy have been excluded. Risk factors include certain medications and treatment modalities such as radiation, anthracycline, alkylating agents and most recently checkpoint inhibitors.  
5.1.7 Contraindications 
There are no reported contraindications associated with the use of 
pembrolizumab.  Pembrolizumab may have adverse effects on a fetus in utero.  Furthermore, it is not known if pembrolizumab has transient adverse effects on the composition of sperm.   
5.1.8 Use in Pregnancy  
If a subject inadvertently becomes pregnant while on treatment with pembrolizumab, the subject will immediately be removed from the study.  The site will contact the subject at least monthly and document the subject’s status until the pregnancy has been completed or terminated.  The outcome of the pregnancy will be reported to the LCCC Multicenter Project Manager who will 
report the event  to Merck without delay and within 24 hours if the outcome is a 
serious adverse experience (e.g., death, abortion, congenital anomaly, or other 
disabling or life -threatening complication to the mother or newborn).  The study 
investigator will make every effort to obtain permission to follow the outcome of the pregnancy and report the condition of the fetus or newborn to the LCCC 
Multicenter  Project Manager. If a male subject impregnates his female partner the 
study personnel at the site must be informed immediately and the pregnancy

40 reported to the LCCC Multicenter  Project Manager who will report the event to 
Merck , and followed as described above and in Section 7.3.3. 
5.1.9 Use in Nursing Women  
It is unknown whether pembrolizumab is excreted in human milk.  Since many 
drugs are excreted in human milk, and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in the nursing infant, subjects who are breast-feeding are not eligible for enrollment.  
5.1.10 Overdose  
For purposes of this trial, an overdose will be defined as any dose of 1 ,000 mg or 
greater (≥ 5 times the indicated dose). No specific information is available on the treatment of overdose of pembrolizumab. In the event of overdose, pembrolizumab should be discontinued and the subject should be observed closely for signs of toxicity.  Appropriate supportive treatment should be provided if clinically indicated.  
 If an adverse event(s)  is associated with (“results from”) the overdose of a Merck 
product, the adverse event(s) is reported as a serious adverse event, even if no other seriousness criteria are met.  
 If a dose of Merck’s product meeting the protocol definition of overdose is taken 
without any associated clinical symptoms or abnormal laboratory results, the overdose is reported as a non- serious Event of Clinical Interest (ECI), using the 
terminology “accidental or intentional overdose without adverse effect.” All reports of overdose with and without an adverse event must be reported within 24 hours to the LCCC Multicenter  Project Manager who will report the event 
within 2 working days hours to Merck Global Safety. (Attn: Worldwide Product Safety; FAX 215 993-1220) (see section 7.3.3).  
5.2 Cytarabine 
Mechanism of action: Cytarabine works by inhibition of DNA synthesis. Cytosine 
gains entry into cells by a carrier process, and then must be converted to its active compound, aracytidine triphosphate. Cytosine is a pyrimidine analog, which is incorporated into DNA; however, its primary action is inhibition of DNA 
polymerase resulting in decreased DNA synthesis and repair.  
 
Product description: Cytarabine  (conventional) is commercially available in vials 
containing 20 mg/ml (25 ml) and 100 mg/ml (20 ml) solution for injection and are 
stable at room temperature.  
 
Solution preparation: Cytarabine can be compounded in 100- 1000 ml of NS or 
D5W and is stable at room temperature for 48 hours once compounded. Cytarabine 
solutions reconstituted with diluents containing benzyl  alcohol should not be used 
for intrathecal injections or for IV administration of high dose cytarabine (> 1 
LCCC 1522  CONFIDENTIAL  
PI: Zeidner   UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA  
June 02, 2018   Amendment 07  
 
 
41 gm/m2). Solutions for parenteral administration are generally reconstituted to 
concentrations ranging from 20- 100 mg/ml, depending on the dose and the route of 
administration.  
 
Solutions are stable at room temperature for 7 days, but use within 48 hours of preparation , or refrigerated for 24 hours beyond use date, is recommended by the 
manufactur er.  Furthermore, solutions prepared with diluents which do not contain 
preservative or bacteriostat, should be used within 8 hrs of vial entry to minimize the risk of bacterial contamination.  
 
Premedication:  Dexamethasone 0.1% ophthalmic eye drops should be administered 
>1 hour prior to cytarabine infusion to both eyes and continued Q6hours through day 12 of treatment.  
 
Route of administration : Cytarabine will be administered intravenously in a dose 
that adjusted due to age: <60 years: 2 gm/m2 IV Q12hours days 1 -5; > 60 years: 1.5  
gm/m2 IV Q12hours days 1-5 over 2 hours. The infusion should not be interrupted 
for the delivery of blood products, antibiotics, etc.  
 
Handling and Disposal: Please see policy on hazardous drugs:

5.3 Adverse Events Associated with Cytarabine 
Serious and Common Adverse Effects:  
The most common toxicities associated with cytar abine, even when used at doses 
≤200mg/m2 include hematologic (neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia), 
gastrointestinal (nausea & vomiting (this agent is highly emetogenic ), diarrhea 
and mucositis), dermatologic (rash), hepatic (hepatic dysfunction, mild jaundice, transaminase elevations ), non- infectious fever, and alopecia. Additional toxicities 
associated with high dose cytarabine (≥ 1gm/m
2) include neurologic (primarily 
cerebellar  such as nystagmus, ataxia, abnormal gait), but also cerebral such as 
somnolence, psychosis, confusion seizures), ocular toxicity, and rarely pulmonary edema.

Key to Time and Events Table Footnotes  
1 Unless otherwise noted, evaluations may be performed up to 2 weeks prior to Cycle 1 Day 1 of treatment. 
Cycle 1 Day 1 laboratory assessments do not need to be repeated if they have been performed up to 72 
hours prior to the scheduled visit.  NOTE : A window of 2 days will be applied to all study visits.  
 
2Full h ematologic  recovery is defined as absolute neutrophil count >1,000/mcL and platelet count 
>100,000/mcL. All assessments listed including a  disease assessment via bone marrow biopsy will occur at 
hematologic recovery, or by day 45 +/- 2 days, whichever comes first. See section 4.2 for additional details 
regarding D14 pembrolizumab delay .  
 
3Patients in ≥PR based on BM biopsy may continue to receive pembrolizumab every 21 days +/ -3 days (1 
cycle) until maintenance treatment duration totals 1 year (see section 4.3 for additional details) , disease 
progression, or intolerable toxicity, whichever occurs first. Pembrolizumab will start 10 -60 days post full 
hematologic recovery in those who achieve PR or CR , and 10- 60 days post the post induction bone marrow 
biopsy  in those who achieve CRi. Patients who do not achieve at least a PR, or receive pembrolizumab 
maintenance by day 60 of hematologic recovery (or day 60 post -induction bone marrow biopsy in CRi 
patients)  will be taken off of protocol- mandated therapy and followed up per protocol.  
  
4This end of treatment (EOT) visit should occur in patients when they stop treatment whether due to disease 
progression, unmanageable toxicity, or they have reached 2years of treatment, and will take place ~30 days 
post last dose of pembrolizumab. Patients who experience ≥Grade 2 treatment -related adverse event will be 
contacted very 2 weeks until the event is resolved to Grade 0 or 1, determined to be irreversible by the investigator, or until the patient begins an alternate form of drug treatment.  
 
5The first long -term follow -up visits will take place  ~ 60 days after the EOT visit (+/ - 15 days) and will 
focus on any serious adverse events (SAEs) or any grade of Events of Clinical Interest (see  section 7.3.4.1 ) 
that occur within 90 days of the end of pembrolizumab (or prior to start of new anti -cancer therapy).  Any 
such events must be recorded.   Subsequent long- term follow up visits  will take place at a schedule as per 
institutional standard of care (i.e., usually every ~ 3-6 months) and will be limited to history of any 
subsequent cancer treatments, an assessment of any SAE’s consid ered to be possibly or probably related to 
study treatment until resolution, and survival status.   
 
6Complete history at baseline only, thereafter focused history on symptoms/toxicity.  Physical exam to 
include height (baseline only), weight (D1 and D14 o f cycle 1, D1 of all cycles of maintenance 
pembrolizumab and all follow -up visits) and vital signs  
 
7Serum or urine B -HCG within 72 hours prior to D1 of HiDAC and prior to D14 pembrolizumab, and only 
if clinically appropriate; if the urine test is positive  or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy 
test will be required.  
 
8Serum chemistries include Na, K, Cl, creatinine, BUN, calcium, magnesium, bicarbonate, , and glucose; 
serum chemistries alon g with  LDH,  uric acid, and phosphate  comprise tumor lysis labs. During induction, 
tumor lysis labs  should be assessed BID (twice daily) D1 -5, and once daily from D6  until tumor lysis 
syndrome is resolved , which usually occurs by D10. Repeat LDH, uric acid and phosphate on D14.     
 
9Liver function tests (LFTs) include total protein, albumin, total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, ALT, and 
AST  (NOTE:  on D6 -13, and on D15 through recovery, LFTs only required every other day) ; coagulation 
labs include PT/INR, aPTT, D-Dimer  and fibrinogen

10Thyroid tests include T3, free T4, TSH  as denoted during induction therapy. These tests should be 
performed on D1/C1 prior to starting maintenance therapy  with pembrolizumab  and repeated every 3 
cycles thereafter (i.e., cycles 3, 6, 9, 12, etc.) until treatment discontinuation.  
 
11Initial (pre -treatment) bone marrow biopsy should be obtained within 14 days prior to D1 of HiDAC as 
per standard of care. Patients will undergo repeat bone marrow at time of  full hematologic recovery or on 
D45 +/- 2 days whichever comes first  as per standard of care. Repeat biopsy after every 4 cycles of 
maintenance  during year 1 and every 6  cycles of maintenance during year 1 -2. Each time a bone marrow 
biopsy is done as per standard of care, additional 4x8mL will be collected in green top ACD tubes (~32 mL) for correlative studies . See section 6.7 and the laboratory manual for additional details.  Repeat biopsy 
at any time if there is a suspicion of leukemia recurrence either during maintenance phase or in follow -up.  
 
12 Buccal cell collection  should be collected from all patients during screening. If not done during 
screening, this can be performed at any point during follow -up. P lease see laboratory manual for details. 
For peripheral blood samples for research, collect 5 x8mL ACD green top tubes of blood (~40mLs) pre -
treatment within 14 days prior to D1 of HiDAC, D14 (1- 12 hours prior to pembrolizumab administration), 
weekly betwe en D14 and hematologic recovery (i.e. D21, D28, D35, and D42 (the latter if no  full 
hematologic recovery by this time) and at  full hematologic recovery or on D45+/ - 2 days whichever occurs 
first. Repeat blood sample on D1 of each maintenance cycle of pembrolizumab during year 1 and every 
even cycle of maintenance during year 1 -2. Repeat blood sample at any time if there is a suspicion of 
leukemia recurrence either during maintenance phase or in follow -up. See section 6.7 and the laboratory 
manual for additional details.   
 
13Patients discharged from the hospital prior to early recovery should receive CBC, serum chemistries, and 
liver function tests at minimum thr ee times weekly until early recovery  
 
14Shoul d be completed during each cycle of maintenance therapy  (ie, day 1 of each cycle). Completion of 
the questionnaire will be optional .

 resolved to Grade 0 or 1, determined to be irreversible by the investigator, or until the 
patient begins an alternate form of drug treatment.  
6.6 Follow- up 
The first l ong-term follow -up visit will take place ~ 60 days after the EOT visit 
(+/- 15 days) and will focus on any serious adverse events (SAEs) or any grade of 
Events of Clinical Interest that occur within 90 days of the end of pembrolizumab (or prior to start of new anti -cancer therapy).  Any such events must be recorded.   
Subsequent long- term follow up visits will take place as per inst itutional standard 
of care (i.e., typically every 3 -6 months) and will be limited to history of any 
subsequent cancer treatments, an assessment of any SAE’s considered to be possibly or probably related to study treatment until resolution, and survival status.   
6.7 Correlative Studies Procedures  
These are described in more detail in the laboratory manual. NOTE: A tumor 
sample will be sent to Merck or their designated laboratory for evaluation of PD-L1 expression at baseline. See laboratory manual for additional details.  
 
Samples will be processed within 24 hours of collection as outlined in the Standard Operating Procedure Guidelines in the Laboratory Manual.   Some of the specific correlative details regarding specific antibodies, repertoires etc. may  vary from this protocol, but will be maintained and updated in the 
corresponding laboratory manual. 
6.7.1 mRNA S equencing (mRNA -seq) and P roteonomics  
mRNA- seq of bulk bone marrow leukocyte samples from diagnostic specimens 
will be performed for definition of tumor genetic subtypes, quantification of PD-L1 mRNA expression, and evaluation of gene expression signatures associated with immune activation and suppression.  Bulk bone marrow leukocyte samples will also be sorted into CD34
+ and CD34- subpopulations, and the CD34+ 
populations will undergo 1) mRNA-seq for neoantigen prediction and analysis of differential splicing, and 2) mass spectrometry for neoantigen confirmation. The 
CD34
- fraction will be stored for the generation of cytotoxic T lymphocyte 
cultures fo r confirmation of biologically valid neoantigens.   
 The mRNA -seq studies will involve genetic research where tumor gene 
expression profiling and analysis of somatic mutations will be included.  Appropriate informed consent for genetic research will be obtained prior to patient samples being processed.  
6.7.2 High -Throughput DNA sequencing  
Whole exome sequencing of CD34
+ AML blasts from bone marrow samples will 
be performed for somatic mutation detection and neoantigen prediction. From

 bone marrow and peripheral blood leukocyte samples, T cell functional studies 
will be performed, and T cell receptor (TCR) and B cell receptor (BCR) 
repertoires will be amplified, sequenced, and analyzed to discover receptor profiles that correlate with response to thera py.  
6.7.3 Flow Cytometry/Immunohistochemistry of Immune Markers  
Bone marrow core biopsy blocks/slides may be stained for coexpression using the following panel of fluorescent antibodies (can include but not limited to): CD4/FoxP3, CD8/PD1, CD19/CD27, CD11b/CD33, CD47/CD68, along with immunohistochemistry staining using the following antibodies: PD -L1, IFN -γ, 
TNF -α, CTLA4, KIR3DL1, LAG3, CD200, Tim3 (HAVCR2), BTLA, CD137 
(TNFRSF9), CD40, OX40, CD27, ICOS, and GITR (TNFRSF18), which combined will enable quantific ation and localization of effector T cells, 
regulatory T cells, myeloid derived suppressor cells, antigen-experienced vs. non-experienced B cells, and suppressive macrophages. 
6.7.4 Minimal Residual Disease Analysis  
Cryopreserved mononuclear cells from bone marr ow aspirate and/or peripheral 
blood will be analyzed for minimal residual disease assays via flow cytometry, DNA or RNA PCR.  
6.8 Assessment of Safety  
Any patient who receives  pembrolizumab treatment on this protocol will be 
evaluable for toxicity. Each patient will be assessed periodically for the development of any toxicity according to the Time and Events table (6.0). Toxicity will be assessed according to NCI CTCAE v4.  Toxicities will be  
characterized in terms of seriousness, causality, toxicity grading, and action taken 
with regard to trial treatment.  
 For subjects receiving treatment with pembrolizumab , all AEs of unknown 
etiology associated with p embrolizumab exposure should be evaluated to 
determine if it is possibly an event of clinical interest (ECI) of a potentially immunologic etiology (termed immune -related adverse events, or irAEs); see the 
separate ECI guidance document (provided as a document separate from this 
protocol) regar ding the identification, evaluation and management of potential 
irAEs.   
 Please refer  to section 7.0 for detailed information regarding the assessment and 
recordi ng of AEs.   
6.9 Assessment of Efficacy  
Patients who have received pembrolizumab within the induction phase (cycle) will be evaluable for assessment of response and progression. Efficacy of treatment will be assessed by a bone marrow biopsy at the time of hematologic recovery (i.e., absolute neutrophil count > 1,000/mcL and platelet count 
LCCC 1522  CONFIDENTIAL

52 
 >100,000/mcL), or by  day 45 +/ - 2 days of induction treatment , whichever occurs 
first. Response will be assessed by standard international criteria proposed by the 
European LeukemiaNet Guidelines in AML.21  
 
Complete remission  (CR) : Bone marrow blasts <5%; absence of Auer rods; 
absence of extramedullary di sease; absolute neutrophil count >1,000/mcL; 
platelet count >100,000/mcL; independence of red cell transfusions 
 
Complete remission with incomplete recovery (CRi): All CR criteria except for 
residual neutropenia (<1,000/mcL) or thrombocytopenia (<100,000/m cL) plus 
independent of platelet transfusions.  
 
Partial response (PR): bone marrow blasts 5- 25% and decrease of pretreatment 
bone marrow blast % by > 50%; all hematologic criteria of CR.  
 
Patients who achieve a PR to induction phase and then achieve CR aft er 
maintenance pembrolizumab will be assessed as an overall CR to study treatment.  
6.9.1 Progression -Free Survival  and Relapse  
Progression-free survival (PFS) will be defined as time from response (i.e., PR/CR/CRi) until disease progression or death. In patients who achieve a PR after 
Induction Phase, progression will be defined as  >50% increase in bone marrow blast % over baseline from beginning Maintenance Phase with a minimum 15% point increase in blasts, loss of PR (i.e., >25% bone marrow blasts), le ukemia-
related complications such as transfusion dependence, presence of extramedullary disease (including symptomatic CNS disease), or circulating blasts. This is 
consistent with European LeukemiaNet Guidelines 2017.
2 Progression will be 
defined as relaps e (i.e., >5% bone marrow blasts) in patients who initially 
achieved a CR or CRi with induction phase. Patients who undergo an allogeneic stem cell transplant will be censored for PFS.  
6.9.2 Relapse- Free Survival  
Relapse- free survival (RFS) will be defined as ti me from CR or CRi until relapse 
or death. Relapse will be defined as bone marrow blasts >5% in a patient who 
initially achieved a CR or CRi after induction phase. Patients who undergo an allogeneic stem cell transplant will be censored for RFS.  
 
7.0 ADVERSE E VENTS  
7.1 Definition s  
7.1.1 Adverse Event (AE)  
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence (e.g., an abnormal laboratory finding, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a 
LCCC 1522  CONFIDENTIAL  
PI: Zeidner   UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA  
June 02, 2018   Amendment 07  
 
 
53 
 drug) in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical 
product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment.  An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not related to the medicinal product.   
 
Hospitalization for elective surgery or routine clinical procedures that are not the result of an AE (e.g., surgical insertion of central line) need not be considered AEs and should not be recorded as an AE.  Disease progression should not be recorded as an AE, unless it is attributable by the investigator to the study therapy. 
7.1.2 Suspected Adverse Reaction (SAR)  
A suspected adverse reaction (SAR) is any AE for which there is a reasonable 
possibility  that the drug is the cause.   Reasonable possibility  means that there is 
evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the AE.  A suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser degree of certainty about causality than adverse reaction, which means any adverse event caused by a drug.   
 
Causality assessment to a study drug is a  medical judgment made in consideration 
of the following factors: temporal relationship of the AE to study drug exposure, known mechanism of action or side effect profile of study treatment, other recent or concomitant drug exposures, normal clinical course of the disease under investigation, and any other underlying or concurrent medical conditions.  Other factors to consider in considering drug as the cause of the AE: 
• Single occurrence of an uncommon event known to be strongly associated with drug exposure (e.g., angioedema, hepatic injury, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome) 
• One or more occurr ences of an event not commonly associated with drug 
exposure, but otherwise uncommon in the population (e.g., tendon rupture); often more than once occurrence from one or multiple studies would be needed before the sponsor could determine that there is reasonable possibility  that the drug caused the event.   
• An aggregate analysis of specific events observed in a clinical trial that indicates the events occur more frequently in the drug treatment group than in a concurrent or historical control group  
7.1.3 Unexpected AE or SAR  
An AE or SAR is considered unexpected if  the specificity or severity of it is not 
consistent with the applicable product information (e.g., Investigator’s Brochure (IB) for an unapproved investigational product or package insert/summar y of 
product characteristics for an approved product).  Unexpected also refers to AEs 
or SARs that are mentioned in the IB as occurring with a class of drugs or as 
LCCC 1522  CONFIDENTIAL  
PI: Zeidner   UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA  
June 02, 2018   Amendment 07  
 
 
54 
 anticipated from the pharmacological properties of the drug, but are not 
specifically mentio ned as occurring with the particular drug under investigation.   
7.1.4 Serious AE or SAR  
An AE or SAR is considered serious if, in the view of either the investigator or 
sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes: 
• Death;  
• Is life -threatening (places the  subject at immediate risk of death from 
the event as it occurred);  
• Requires inpatient hospitalization (>24 hours) or prolongation of 
existing hospitalization;*  
• Results in  congenital anomaly/birth defect;  
• Results in a persistent or significant incapacity o r substantial 
disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions; 
• Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -
threatening, or require hospitalization may be considered a serious 
adverse drug experience when, based upon appropriat e medical 
judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in the definition.  For reporting purposes, also consider the occurrences of pregnancy as an event which must be reported as an important medical event.  
 *Hospitalization for anticipated or protocol specified procedures such as administration of chemotherapy, central line insertion, metastasis interventional therapy, resection of primary tumor, or elective surgery, will not be considered serious adverse events.  
 Pregnancy that occurs during the study must also be reported as an SAE. 
• Note:  In addition to the above criteria, adverse events meeting either of the 
below criteria, although not serious per ICH definition, are reportable to the Merck in the same timeframe as SAEs to meet certain local requirements. Therefore, these events are considered serious by Merck for collection purposes. 
● Is a new cancer (that is not a condition of the study); ● Is associated with an overdose.  
 
7.2 Document ation of non- serious AEs or SARs  
For non-serious AEs or SARs, documentation must begin from day 1 of stud y 
treatment and continue through the 30 day follow- up period after treatment is 
discontinued.   
 
LCCC 1522  CONFIDENTIAL  
PI: Zeidner   UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA  
June 02, 2018   Amendment 07  
 
 
55 
 Collected information should be recorded in the Case Report Forms (CRF) for 
that patient.  Please include a description of the event, its severity or toxicity 
grade, onset and resolved dates (if applicable), and the relationship to the study 
drug.    Documentation should occur at least monthly.  
7.3 SAEs or Serious SARs and Events of Clinical Interest  
7.3.1 Timing  
After informed consent but prior to initiation of study medications, only SAEs caused by a protocol -mandated intervention will be collected (e.g. SAEs related to 
invasive procedures such as biopsies, medication washout.   For any other experience or condition that meets the definition of an SAE or a 
serious SAR, recording of the event must begin from day 1 of study treatment and continue through the 90 day follow -up period after treatment is discontinued (or 
to the initiation of new anti- cancer treatment, whichever is earliest) .  
7.3.2 Documentation and Notification  
SAE s or Serious SARs must be recorded in  the SAE console within Oncore™ for 
that patient within 24 hours of learning of its occurrence.  Additionally, the LCCC 
Multicenter  Project Manager must also be notified via email of all SAEs within 
24 hours of learning of its occurrence.  
7.3.3 Reporting  
IRB Reporting Requirements:  
UNC : 
• The UNC -IRB will be notified of all SAEs that qualify as an 
Unanticipated Problem as per the UNC IRB Policies using the IRB’s web-
based reporting system (see section 9.5.3) within 7 days of the Investigator becoming aware of the problem.   
 
Affiliate sites:   
• For affiliate sites using a local IRB of record, please submit adverse events per local IRB policy. 
• For affiliate sites relying on the UNC -IRB any SAEs that qualify as an 
Unanticipated Problem will be entered into Oncore and reported to the UNC IRB by the LCCC Multicenter  using the IRB’s web-based reporting 
system (see section 9.5.3) within 7 days of the Investigator becoming aware of the problem.   
 
Pregnancy  or lactation  
It is the responsibility of investigators or their designees to report any pregnancy 
or lactation in a subject (spontaneously reported to them), including the pregnancy 
LCCC 1522  CONFIDENTIAL  
PI: Zeidner   UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA

56 
 of a male subject's female partner that occurs during the trial or within  120 days 
of completing the trial completing the trial, or 30 days following cessation of 
treatment if the subject initiates new anticancer therapy, whichever is earlier, as a serious adverse event.  The patient is to be discontinued immediately  from any 
protocol directed therapy. All subjects and female partners of male subjects who become pregnant must be followed to the completion/termination of the pregnancy. Pregnancy outcomes of spontaneous abortion, missed abortion, benign hydatidiform mole, blighted  ovum, fetal death, intrauterine death, miscarriage and 
stillbirth must be reported as serious adverse events.   If the pregnancy continues 
to term, the outcome (health of infant) must also be reported. Such events must be reported within 24 hours to the LCCC Multicenter  Project Manage r who will 
report the event  within 2 days to the manufacturer (Merck; see below 7.3.4.2).  
 The pregnancy, suspected pregnancy, or positive pregnancy test must be reported to the LCCC Multicenter  Project Manager within 24 hours via email 
(CPOMulticenter@med.unc.edu) or via facsimile to 919 -966-4300.  The female 
subject should be referred to an obstetrician-gynecologist, preferably one experienced in reproductive toxicity for further evaluation and counseling. 
  FDA Expedited Reporting requirements:  
A sponsor must report any suspected adverse reaction that is both serious and unexpected to the FDA. The sponsor must report an adverse event as a suspected adverse reaction only if there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the adverse event, such as: 
• A single occurrence of an event that is uncommon and known to be strongly associated with drug exposure (e.g., angioedema, hepatic injury, Stevens -Johnson Syndrome); 
• One or more occurrences of an event that is not commonly associated with drug exposure, but is otherwise uncommon in the population exposed to the drug (e.g. tendon rupture); 
• An aggregate analysis of specific events observed in a clinical trial (such as known consequences of underlying disease or condition under investigation or other events that commonly occur in the study population independent of drug therapy) that indicates those events occur more frequently in the drug treatment group than in a concurrent or historical control group.  
The sponsor must submit each IND safety report on FDA Form 3500A. Each notification to FDA must bear prominent identification of its contents, i.e., “IND Safety Report,” and must be transmitted to the review division that has the 
responsibility for review of the IND. For this study, the review division is the 
Center for Drug Evaluation and Research.  In each IND safety report, the sponsor 
must identify all IND safety reports pr eviously submitted to FDA concerning a 
similar suspected adverse reaction and must analyze the significance of the 
LCCC 1522  CONFIDENTIAL  
PI: Zeidner   UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA  
June 02, 2018   Amendment 07  
 
 
57 
 suspected adverse reaction in light of previous, similar reports or any other 
relevant information.   
Timing  
FDA must be notified of potential serious risks within 15 calendar days after the sponsor determines the event requires reporting. FDA must be notified of unexpected fatal or life- threatening suspected adverse reactions as soon as 
possible but in no case later than 7 calendar day s after the sponsor’s initial receipt 
of the information. The sponsor must be notified of the SAE by the investigator within 24 hours of the event. If the results of a sponsor’s investigation show that an adverse event not initially determined to be report able is reportable, the 
sponsor must report such suspected adverse reaction in an IND safety report as soon as possible, but in no case later than 15 calendar days after the determination is made.  
 
Follow-up 
The sponsor must promptly investigate all safety information it receives. Relevant follow-up information to an IND safety report must be submitted as soon as the information is available and must be identified as such, i.e., “Follow- up IND 
Safety Report.” Additionally, upon request from FDA, the sponsor must submit to FDA any additional data or information that the agency deems necessary, as soon as possible, but in no case later than 15 calendar days after receiving the request.   
Notification of Investigators  
The sponsor must notify all participating i nvestigators (i.e., all investigators to 
whom the sponsor is providing drug under its INDs or under any investigator’s IND) in an IND safety report of potential serious risks, from clinical trials or any other source, as soon as possible, but in no case later than 15 calendar days after the sponsor determines that the information qualifies for reporting.   
Process  
If the sponsor deems that an event is both a serious adverse reaction (SAR) AND unexpected, it must also (in addition to OnCore
®) be recorded on the MedWatch 
Form 3500A as per 21 CFR 312.32. Unexpected adverse events or adverse reaction refers to an event or reaction that is not listed in the investigator’s brochure or is not listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed; or if an in vestigator’s 
brochure is not required or available, is not consistent with the risk information described in the general investigation plan or elsewhere in the current IND application.    The MedWatch form should be emailed or  faxed to the Multicenter  Proj ect 
Manager at CPOMulticenter@med.unc.edu
 or 919-966-4300  along with supporting 
documentation defining the event and causality.  The Multicenter  Project Manager 
will then send the report to the Funding Source. The MedWatch 3500A form can be

 accessed at: 
http://www.fda.gov/Safety/MedWatch/HowToReport/DownloadForms/default.htm .  
 
(Please be sure and access form 3500A, and not form 3500).  
 Once the UNC Principal Investigator works with the sponsor to determine an event is a serious SAR AND unexpected, the MedWatch 3500A form will be submitted to the FDA.  If the event is serious, unexpected and considered to be possibly-, probably- or definitely -related to the study treatment, the Multicenter  Project 
Manager will inform the Regulatory Associate at UNC, who with the aid of the IND Specialist, will submit the IND Safety Report via IND serial submission to the FDA review division.   All IND safety reports must be submitted on Form 3500A and be accompanied by Form 1571. The FDA must be notified or any unexpected or life- threatening 
suspected adverse reactions as soon as possible, but no later than 7 calendar days of learning of the event.  
 The Multicenter  Project Manager will also be responsible for informing each 
Affiliate site of all serious and unexpected SARs reported to the FDA via fax as soon as possible.    
Additional Reporting Requirements 
The following additional items must be reported via IND safety report: 
• Findings from other studies. The sponsor must report any findings from epidemiological studies, pooled analysis of multiple studies, or clinical studies, whether or not conducted under an IND, and whether or not conducted by the sponsor, that suggest a significant risk to humans exposed to the drug.  
• Findings from animal or in vitro testing. The sponsor must report any findings from animal or in vitro testing, whether or not conducted by the 
sponsor, that suggest a significant risk in humans exposed to the drug, such as reports of mutagenicity, teratogenicity, or carcinogenicity, or reports of significant organ toxicity t or near the expected human exposure. 
• Increased rate of occurrence of serious suspected adverse rea ctions. 
 
Additional Guidance 
Please refer to 21CFR312.32 and “Guidance for Industry and Investigators: Safety Reporting Requirements for INDs and BA/BE Studies” for additional information and reporting requirements. All IND Safety Reports will be submitted in accordance with these reg ulations/guidances.

 7.3.4 Merck Reporting Requirements:  
For the time period beginning when the consent form is signed until treatment 
allocation/randomization, any serious adverse event, or follow up to a serious adverse event, including death due to any cause other than progression of the cancer under study that occurs to any subject must be reported within 24 hours to the Sponsor and within 2 working days to Merck Global Safety if it causes the subject to be excluded from the trial, or is the result of a protocol-specified intervention, including but not limited to washout or discontinuation of usual therapy, diet, placebo treatment or a procedure. 
For the time period beginning at treatment allocation/randomization through 90 
days following cessation of treatm ent, or 30 days following cessation of treatment 
if the subject initiates new anticancer therapy, whichever is earlier, any serious adverse event, or follow up to a serious adverse event, including death due to any cause other than progression of the cancer under study whether or not related to 
the Merck product, must be reported within 24 hours to the Sponsor and within 2 working days to Merck Global Safety. 
Additionally, any serious adverse event, considered by an investigator who is a 
qualified physician  to be related to Merck product that is brought to the attention 
of the investigator at any time following consent through the end of the specified safety follow -up period specified in the paragraph above, or at any time outside of 
the time period specifie d in the previous paragraph also must be reported 
immediately to the Sponsor and to Merck Global Safety. 
All subjects with serious adverse events must be followed up for outcome. 
 
SAE reports and any other relevant safety information are to be forwarded to 
the Merck G lobal Safety facsimile number:  +1 -215-993-1220  
 A copy of all 15 Day Reports and Annual Progress Reports is submitted as required by FDA, European Union (EU), Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices agency (PMDA) or other local regulators. Investigators will cross reference this submission according to local regulations to the Merck Investigational Compound Number (IND, CSA, etc.) at the time of submission.  Additionally investigators will submit a copy of these reports to Merck & Co., Inc. (Attn: Worldwide Product Safety; FAX 215 993-1220) at the time of submission to FDA. 
7.3.4.1 Events of Clinical Interest  
Selected non -serious and serious adverse events are also known as Events of 
Clinical Interest (ECI) and must be reported within 24 hours to the LCCC 
Multicenter  Project Manager who will report the event within 2 working days to 
Merck Global Safety.  (Attn: Worldwide Product Safety; FAX 215 993-1220) 
 For the time period beginning when the consent form is signed until treatment allocation/randomization , any ECI, or follow up to an ECI, that occurs to any 
LCCC 1522  CONFIDENTIAL  
PI: Zeidner   UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA  
June 02, 2018   Amendment 07  
 
 
60 
 subject must be reported within 24 hours to the Sponsor and within 2 working 
days to Merck Global Safety if it causes the subject to be excluded from the trial, 
or is the result of a protocol- specified intervention, including but not limited to 
washout or discontinuation of usual therapy, diet, placebo treatment or a procedure. 
For the time period beginning at treatment allocation/randomization through 90 
days following cessation of treatment, or 30 days following cessation of treatment if the subject initiates new anticancer therapy, whichever is earlier, any ECI, or follow up to an ECI, whether or not related to Merck  product, must be reported 
within 24 hours to the Sponsor and within 24 hours to Merck Global Safety.  
Events of clinical interest for this trial include:  1. an overdose of Merck product, as defined  in Section  5.1.10 - Definition of an 
Overdose for This Protocol and Reporting of Overdose to the Sponsor, that is not associated with clinical symptoms or abnormal laboratory results.  
  2.   an elevated AST or ALT lab value that is greater than or equal to 3X the upper 
limit of normal and an elevated total b ilirubin lab value that is greater than or 
equal to 2X the upper limit of normal and, at the same time, an alkaline phosphatase lab value that is less than 2X the upper limit of normal, as determined by way of protocol- specified laboratory testing or unscheduled 
laboratory testing.*  
*Note:  These criteria are based upon available regulatory guidance 
documents. The purpose of the criteria is to specify a threshold of abnormal hepatic tests that may require an additional evaluation for an underlying etiology.   
7.3.4.2 Reporting of Pregnancy and Lactation to the Sponsor and to Merck 
Although pregnancy and lactation are not considered AEs , it is the responsibility 
of investigators or their designees to report any pregnancy or lactation in a subject (spontaneously reported to them), including the pregnancy of a male subject's female partner) that occurs during the trial or within.  Pregnancies and lactations 
that occur after the consent form is signed but before treatment allocation/ randomization must be reported by the investigator if they cause the subject to be excluded from the trial, or are the result of a protocol -specified intervention, 
including but not limited to washout or discontinuation of usual therapy, diet, placebo treatment or a procedure.   
 Pregnancies an d lactations that occur from the time of treatment 
allocation/randomization through 120 days of completing the trial completing the trial following cessation of Sponsor’s product, or 30 days following cessation of treatment if the subject initiates new anticancer therapy, whichever is earlier, must be reported by the investigator.  All subjects and female partners of male subjects who become pregnant reported pregnancies must be followed to the completion/ 
LCCC 1522  CONFIDENTIAL

61 
 termination of the pregnancy.  Pregnancy outcomes of spontaneous abortion, 
missed abortion, benign hydatidiform mole, blighted ovum, fetal death, intrauterine death, miscarriage and stillbirth must be reported as serious events (Important Medical Events).  If the pregnancy continues to term, the outcome (health of infant) must also be reported. 
 Such events must be reported within 24 hours to the Sponsor and within 2 working days to Merck Global Safety. (Attn: Worldwide Product Safety; FAX 215 993-1220) 
7.3.4.3 Protocol -Specific Exceptions to Serious Adverse Event Reporting   
Efficacy endpoints as outlined in this section  will not be reported as AEs  to Merck  
or FDA , unless there is evidence suggesting a causal relationship between the 
drug and the event. Any such event will be submitted to Merck Global Safety within 2 working days either by electronic or paper media. 
 Specifically, the suspected/actual events covered in this exception include any event that is disease progression of the cancer under study.  Hospitalization related to convenience (e.g.transportation issues etc.) will not be considered a SAE.  
7.4 Data and Safety Monitoring Plan 
The Principal  Investigator will provide continuous monitoring of patient safety in 
this trial with periodic reporting to the Data and Safety Monitoring C ommittee 
(DSM C).  
 Meetings/teleconferences  will be held at a frequency dependent on study accrual, 
and in consultation with the study Biostatistician.  These meetings will include  the 
investigators  as well as protocol nurses , clinical research associates , regulatory 
associate s, data manager s, biostatistician s, and any other relevant personnel the 
principal investigators may deem appropriate.  At these meetings, the research 
team will discuss  all issues relevant to study progress, including enrollment, 
safety, reg ulatory, dat a collection, etc.  
 The team will produce summaries or minutes of these meetings. These summaries will be available for inspection when requested by any of the regulatory bodies charged with the safety of human subjects and the integrity of data including, but not limited to, the oversight ( Office of Human Research Ethics (OHRE) 
Biomedical  IRB, the Oncology Protocol Review Committee (PRC) or the North 
Carolina TraCS Institute  Data and  Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) .   
 
The UNC LCCC Data and Safety  Monitoring Committee (DSMC) will review the 
study on a regular (quarterly to annually) basis, with the frequency of review based on risk and complexity as determined by the UNC Protocol Review 
LCCC 1522  CONFIDENTIAL  
PI: Zeidner   UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA  
June 02, 2018   Amendment 07  
 
 
62 
 Committee .  The UNC PI will be responsible for submitting the following 
information for review: 1) safety and accrual data including the number of 
patients treated; 2) significant developments reported in the literature that may 
affect the safety of participants or the ethics of the study; 3) preliminary response 
data; and 4) summaries of team meetings that have occurred since the last report.  
Findings of the DSMC review will be disseminated by memo to the UNC PI, PRC, and the UNC IRB  and DSMB.   
8.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
8.1 Study Design and Sample Size  
This is a multi- center prospective open -label single arm phase 2 study assessing 
the activity of age-adjusted HiDAC ( <60 years: 2 gm/m2 IV Q12hours days 1-5; 
>60 years: 1.5 gm/m2 IV Q12hours days 1-5) salvage induction treatment 
followed by pembrolizumab 200 mg IV on day 14 for relapsed or refractory AML patients.  
 
The subjects who achieve a response (CR, CRi, or PR) to induction phase HiDAC 
followed by pembrolizumab 200 mg IV on day 14, as assessed by standard international European LeukemiaNet Guidelines in AML,
21 will receive 
pembrolizumab 200 mg IV Q3weeks of maintenance therapy beginning 10-30 days following full hematolog ic recovery from induction phase. Maintenance 
treatment will continue until disease progression, toxicity, physician and/or patient discretion, or up to 1 year of treatment.  
 
Simon’s like two-stage design  with relaxed stopping for futility will be used.
53 
The null hypothesis that the true CR rate (CR/CRi) for HiDAC followed by 
pembrolizumab is 20% will be tested against a one -sided alternative hypothesis. 
In this study, “relaxed stopping” refers to inclusion of PR in the first stage as some of these PRs may convert to a CR during maintenance. In the first stage, 19 patients will be enrolled. If the  number of patients who achieve a CR/CRi plus the 
number of patients with PR is equal to  4 or fewer in these 19 patients, the study 
will be stopped. Otherwise, 18 additional patients will be enrolled for a total of 37 
patients. The null hypothesis will be rejected if 12 or more CR/CRi’s are observed 
in 37 patients.. Assuming that the PR rate has a uniform distribution, Uniform (0, 0.05), under H
0, this design yields a type 1 error rate of  at most 5% and power of 
at least  84% when the true CR rate for HiDAC followed by pembrolizumab is 0.4.  
8.2 Continuous Monitoring for Toxicity 
Sequential boundaries will be used to monitor unacceptable toxicity rate in the 
trial. An unacceptable toxicity is defined as any drug -related grade 3 non -
hematologic toxicity  (exceptions inclu de infusion reactions, rash, fever , infection, 
nausea, fatigue and anorexia) persist ing for >7 days despite supportive care), or 
any drug -related grade 4 -5 non- hematologic toxicity  (excluding infection) . The 
accrual will be halted if excessive numbers of unacceptable toxicities is equal to 
LCCC 1522  CONFIDENTIAL  
PI: Zeidner   UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA  
June 02, 2018   Amendment 07  
 
 
63 
 or exceeds b n out of n patients with full follow -up (see Table below). This is a 
Pocock -type stopping boundary that yields the probability of crossing the 
boundary at most 0.05 when the rate of unacceptable toxicity is equal to the 
acceptable rate of 0.2.

 The stopping boundary above will guide enrollment as well as suspension of accrual (i.e., when to stop the trial if necessary) . Initially 3 patients will be 
enrolled. Since the study is stopped when 3 unacceptable toxicities are observed in the first 3 pat ients, we will not enroll a new patient until at least one of the first 
3 patients completes follow -up (i.e., reaches full hematologic recovery , deemed as 
refractory or CRi ) and is confirmed not to have unacceptable toxicity. The 
enrollment will be continued in the same manner so that at any point in the trial the number of patients with unacceptable toxicities and the number of patients in the follow-up does not exceed b
n where n is the total number of patients accrued 
so far.   
8.3 Data Analysis Plans 
The primary endpoint of this study is the overall CR rate (CR+CRi) after HiDAC 
salvage followed by pembrolizumab on day 14. Responses will be assessed by 
standard international European LeukemiaNet Guidelines.21 
 Secondary endpoints include the following: 
• Rates of unacceptable toxicity defined as any drug -related grade 3 non-
hematologic toxicity (exceptions: fever, rash, infection, infusion r eactions , 
nausea, fatigue and anorexia) lasting for >7days despite supportive care, or any drug -related grade >4 non- hematologic toxicity  (excluding infection) 
• Clinician assessed toxicity of HiDAC followed by pembrolizumab will be classified and graded acc ording to NCI CTCAE, version 4.0. 
• Objective overall response rates will be defined as PR+CR+CRi as determined by international European LeukemiaNet Guidelines in AML.
21  
• Clinician assessed toxicity of pembrolizumab maintenance will be classif ied and graded according to NCI CTCAE, version 4.0 
• RFS will b e defined as time from day 1  of CR/CRi to relapse or death 
from any cause.  
• PFS will be defined as time from day 1  of response (i.e., PR/CR/CRi) to 
progression or death from any cause.  
• OS will b e defined as time from day 1  of treatment until date of last 
known follow up or death of any cause.

Survival distributions will be summarized using the method of Kaplan and Meier.  We will report median time where possible. All demographic and analytic 
data will be summarized by descriptive statistics.   Categorical data will be 
summarized using frequency tables while summary statistics such as means, medians, standard deviation, range, etc., will be provided for continuous data.  95% confidence intervals w ill be reported as well.  
9.0 STUDY MANAGEMENT  
9.1 Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approval and Consent  
It is expected that the IRB will have the proper representation and function in accordance with federally mandated regulations.  The IRB should approve the consent form and protocol. 
 
In obtaining and documenting informed consent, the investigator should comply with the applicable regulatory requirement(s), and should adhere to Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and to ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration 
of Helsinki.    Before recruitment and enrollment onto this study, the patient will be given a full explanation of the study and will be given the opportunity to review the consent form. Each consent form must include all the relevant elements currently required 
by the FDA Regulations and local or state regulations. Once this essential information has been provided to the patient and the investigator is assured that the patient understands the implications of participating in the study, the pati ent 
will be asked to give consent to participate in the study by signing an IRB-approved consent form. 
 Prior to a patient’s participation in the trial, the written informed consent form should be signed and personally dated by the patient and by the person who conducted the informed consent discussion. 
9.2 Required Documentation  
Before the study can be initiated at any site, the following documentation must be provided to the Clinical Protocol Office (CPO) at the University of North Carolina.  
 
• A copy of the official IRB approval letter for the protocol and informed consent 
• IRB membership list 
• CVs and medical licensure for the principal investigator and any sub-
investigators who will be involved in the study.

11.2 Appendix B. Dose modification and toxicity management guidelines for immune- related AEs associated with 
pembroli zumab  
General instructions:  
4. Corticosteroid taper should  be initiated upon AE improving to Grade 1 or less and continue to taper over at least 4 weeks.  
5. For situations where pembrolizumab has been withheld, pembrolizumab can be resumed after AE has been reduced to Grade 1 or 0 and 
corticosteroid has been tapered . Pembrolizumab should be permanently discontinued if AE does not resolve within 12 weeks of last dose or 
corticosteroids cannot be reduced to ≤10 mg prednisone or equivalent per day within 12 weeks.  
6. For severe and life -threatening irAEs, IV corticosteroid should be initiated first followed by oral steroid. Other immunosuppressive treatment 
should be initiated if irAEs cannot be controlled by corticosteroids.

without fever) and of bowel perforation (ie, peritoneal signs and ileus).  
• Participants with ≥ Grade 2 diarrhea 
suspecting colitis should consider GI 
consultation and performing endoscopy to rule out colitis.  
• Participants with diarrhea/colitis should be advised to drink liberal quantities of clear 
fluids.  If sufficient oral fluid intake is not Grade 4  Permanently

NOTE:  
For participants with Grade 3 or 4 immune -related endocrinopathy where withhold of pembrolizumab is required, pembrolizumab may be resumed 
when AE resolves to ≤ Grade 2 and is controlled with hormonal replacement therapy or achieved metabolic control (in case of T1DM).   
 
Dose modification and toxicity management of infusion- reactions related to pembrolizumab  
Pembrolizumab may cause severe or life threatening infusion -reactions including severe hypersensitivity or anaphylaxis. Signs 
and symptoms usually develop during or shortly after drug infusion and generally resolve completely within 24 hours of

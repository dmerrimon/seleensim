Title of study : The Comparative Safet y and Effectiveness of dabigatran, versus 
rivaroxaban, and apixaban Utilized in the Department of Defense 
(DoD ) Non -Valvular Atrial Fibrillation Patient Population -A 
Retrospective Database Analy sis
Rationale and 
background:Due to the emergence of multiple pharmaceutical alternatives to 
warfarin, ph ysicians in the US are faced with many  
anticoagula tion options. To help inform their decisions phy sicians 
want to know the comparative safet y and efficacy  profiles of 
these new agents.
Now that real world experience with dabigatran for NVAF 
patients has accrued, the safet y and effectiveness for dabigatran , 
rivaroxaban, and apixaban may  also be assessed and compared in 
this setting.
Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals Inc. (BI PI) has an 
opportunity  to collaborate with DoD to conduct comparative 
safet y and effectiveness studies of dabigatran, rivaroxaban, a nd 
apixaban using alread y existing real world data from DoD’s 
claims and EMR data.
Research 
question and 
objectives:To assess the safet y and effectiveness of newl y initiated 
dabigatran among patients diagnosed with  NVAF in comparison 
to newly  initiated rivaroxaban users and newl y initiated apixaban 
users in two (2) separate study  cohorts :
dabigatran vs. 
rivaroxaban 
dabigatran vs. apixaban
Study design: Non-interventional study  based on existing data with propensity  
score matching (PSM)
Population: NVAF patients, ≥ 18 years of age ,enrolled within the DoD
Military  Health Sy stem ( MHS )who have newly  initiated 
dabigatran
, rivaroxaban or apixaban . Patients must be treatment 
naïve from OAC use prior to first (index) NOAC.

001-MCS -90-124_RD -01(4.0)specified above.  Additional inclusion/exclusion criteria will 
reduce popu lation sizes further but feasibility  estimates provide 
strong support for necessary  sample size.
Data analysis: The target population will include OAC treatment naïve NVAF 
patients with at least one prescription claim for dabigatran, 
rivaroxaban or 
apixaban. For each patient treated with a NOAC, 
the date of the first NOAC prescription (index exposure) will 
serve as the index date. Only  those patients whose index date 
occurs between the respective study  periods will be included. The 
12-month period pr ior to the index date will be defined as the pre -
index period. The patients will be required to have a NVAF 
diagnosis in the pre -index period (including index date).
Study period NOT including pre- index period:
Dabigatran vs. Rivaroxaban: July  1, 2011 to June 30, 
2016 
Dabigatran vs. Apixaban: December 28, 2012 to June 30, 
2016
Study period including pre- index period:
Dabigatran vs. Rivaroxaban: July  1, 2010 to June 30, 2016 
Dabigatran vs. Apixaban: December 28, 2011 to June 30, 
2016
Standard dosing for each NOAC will be used for main anal yses.  
All doses for each NOAC will be combined for a sensitivity  
analysis.Standard dose for NOAC’s:
Dabigatran 150 mg , twice daily , total daily  dose of 300 
mg
Rivaroxaban 20 mg , once daily , total daily  dose of 20 mg
Apixaban 5 mg , twice daily , total daily  dose of 10 mg
Length of Follow -up:
The post -index follow -up period will begin the day  following the 
NOAC index date and end on whichever of the following occurs 
earliest:
The day  of discontinuation of the index NOAC exposure;
The day  before a switch to an anticoagulant different from 
the index exposure;
The day  before a change in dose for the index NOAC;
The end of continuous eligibility  of a patient in the health 
plan (disenrollment) ;
The end of the stud y observation period; or
The date of death of the patient.
The last date of calculated day s supplied if treatment gap

001-MCS -90-124_RD -01(4.0)>30 day s
Patients need at least two day s of exposure to the index NOAC to 
ensure they  had at least one day  of index N OAC exposure in 
the 
post-index follow -up period. A sensitivity  anal ysis will also be 
performed using a 14 day treatment gap. 
Both claims-level data, including diagnosis codes, procedure 
codes, pharmacy  dispensed drugs, cost information, and 
enrolment data, as well as EHR -level data, including relevant lab 
tests and results, will be extracted for all applicable patients.  
Patient demographics, treatment history , and comorbidities, will 
be derived from the electronic database.  Start and stop dates of 
each course of treatment will be coded from the pharmacy  and 
medical claims data using rules to be developed in the study  
protocol.  Comorbidities of interest will be ascertained through 
ICD-9 and ICD -10 diagnosis codes, in combination with 
procedures and medic ations, as appropriate to the study  protocol 
definitions.  
To account for potential selection bias, the study  cohorts 
(dabigatran/rivaroxaban and dabigatran/apixaban) will be 
matched on their baseline characteristics using the propensit y 
score matching ( PSM) method.  The PSM aims to balance the two 
treatment groups on baseline demographics, health plan ty pe and 
clinical characteristics. The feasibility  of PSM will be evaluated 
based on available sample size and descriptive results. I f patient 
characterist ics between dabigatran/rivaroxaban and 
dabigatran/apixaban cohorts are significantl y different, i.e., less 
than 50% of patients in the dabigatran group can be matched to
therivaroxaban or apixaban group based on PSM, then the study  
design will be re -evaluated before proceeding to analy sis. The 
Nearest Neighbor method of propensit y score matching within a 
caliper of 0.10 -0.20 (depending on resulting sample sizes) of the 
standard deviation of the estimated logit will be used to select the 
matched samples.
The propensit y score models will include baseline variables 
known to be confounders or factors related to the outcome only ,
including age, gender, health plan ty pe, geographic region, month 
and y ear of index date, Charlson comorbidity  index (CCI ), stroke 
risk scores (i.e. CHADS 2or CHA 2DS 2-VASc), bleeding risk 
scores (i.e., modified HAS- BLED), specified comorbid 
conditions and medication use , based on literature and clinical 
relevance ,as well as empirical data (top diagnoses, procedures, 
etc.) that may  account for possible unforeseen confounding.

001-MCS -90-124_RD -01(4.0)7. RATIONALE AND BACKGR OUND
Non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) is an abnormal heart rh ythm characterized by  rapid 
and irregular beating. Patients may  experience shortness of breath, palpitations, fainting, or 
chest pain. Anticoagulants have long been used to decrease the risk of stroke in NVAF 
patients and the efficacy  of blood thinners have
been well studied. 
Until recentl y, warfarin, which was FDA -approved in 1954, was the only  drug on the market 
used to prevent stroke in patients with NVAF. In the last few years, the FDA has approved 
three NOACs – dabigatran, rivaroxaban , and apixaban . All three NOACs have shown 
efficacy  in reducing the overall risk of stroke, but, can also increase the risk for bleeding .
In several clinical trials that included more than 50,000 patients from around the world, 
studies concluded that all three NOACs were either equivalent to, or more effective than, 
warfarin in preventing strokes, with an acceptable risk of bleeding.1-6  NOACs have some 
advantages, including fewer interactions with food and other drugs, rapid onset, and freedom 
from the need to have periodic blood test monitoring. Additionall ythe ef fects of these drugs 
wane within a short time frame after they  are stopped, a day  or so, while the effects of 
warfarin persist for man y days after it is discontinued , potentially  causing a slower resolution 
to bleeding events.
There is still an unmet need to truly  understand utilization patterns of NOAC and non- NOAC 
therapies, as well as outcomes and safet y associated with NOACs when compared to one 
another.  Man y traditional insurance plans do not allow for lengthy follow -up periods, as 
patients tend to f requently  switch insurance coverage and in some cases providers. Therefore, 
the ability  to assess longitudinal real -world data in a large patient population poses an unmet 
need in the medical community .  The DoD patient population is well suited to help ta ckle 
these real -world issues due to its “closed loop sy stem”.  DoD beneficiaries have much longer 
treatment durations and follow -up periods because beneficiaries tend to have longer coverage 
periods when compared to traditional commercial insurance plans. 
DoD , in collaboration with
 have successfully  published prior findings in a reputable 
medical journal comparing dabigatran and warfarin in an NVAF patient population (1).  That 
study  aimed to mitigate many  of the potential biases and limitations of observational studies 
via vigorous methodology including inclusion of only  newl y treated patients, propensity  
score matching (PSM) to derive cohorts for comparison, and adjustm ents of covariates if 
needed based on imbalances left following PSM.  Additionally , rules were pre- specified to 
ensure that PSM anal yses of outcomes were onl y performed if there were enough patients per 
cohort to support a robust analy sis.  
The opportuni ty to expand on our initial study  by including additional NOAC usage in a large 
patient population with a relatively long duration of continuous follow -up provides an 
outstanding opportunity  to assess safet y and outcomes in a real -world setting.  Results f rom

RESEARCH QUESTION AND OBJECTIVES
To assess the safet y and effectiveness of newl y initiated dabigatran among patients diagnosed 
with NVAF in comparison to newly  initiated rivaroxaban users and newl y initiated apixaban 
users in two (2) separate study  cohorts :
dabigatran vs. rivaroxaban 
dabigatran vs. apixaban
9. RESEARCH METHODS
9.1 STUDY DESIGN
This is a retrospective database cohort anal ysis of the 
DoD population.
9.2 SETTING
A retrospective cohort study  will be conducted using the DoD database. The target population 
will include OAC treatment naï ve NVAF patients with at least one prescription claim for 
dabigatran, rivaroxaban or apixaban (n ew oral anticoagulant or NOAC). For each patient 
treated with a NOAC, the date of the first NOAC prescription (index exposure) will serve as 
the index date. Onl y those patients whose index date occurs between the respective study  
periods will be included. The 12 -month period prior to the index date will be defined as the 
pre-index period. The patients will be required to have a NVAF diagnosis in the pre- index 
period (including index date). Inclusion and exclusion codes can be found in Appendix B .
Study period NOT including pre- index period:
Dabigatran vs. Rivaroxaban: July  1, 2011 to June 30, 2016 
Dabigatran vs. Apixaban: December 28, 2012 to June 30, 2016
Study period including pre- index period:
Dabigatran vs. Rivaroxaban: July  1, 2010 to June 30, 2016 
Dabigatran vs. Apixaban: December 28, 2011 to June 30, 2016
NOAC approval dates used for study period determination:
Dabigatran (Pradaxa®) – approved October 11, 2010

001-MCS -90-124_RD -01(4.0)The pre -
index period will serve as a look - back period to measure baseline covariate data and 
apply  other inclusion and exclusion criteria.    
Length of Follow -up:
The post -index follow -
up period will begin the day  following the NOAC index date and end 
on whichever of the following occurs earliest:
The day  of discontinuation of the index NOAC exposure;
The day  before a switch to an anticoagulant different from the index exposure;
The day  before a change in dose for the index NOAC;
The end of continuous eligibility  of a patient in the health plan (disenrollment);
The end of the stud y observation period; or
The date of death of the patient.
Patients need at least two days of exposure to the index NOAC to ensure they  had at least one 
day of index NOAC exposure in the post -index follow -up period.
For patients, index exposure will be considered discontinued if there is a treatment gap longer 
than the 30 day  allowable gap specified from the end of the calculated days supplied.  
Patients that have treatment gap longer than the specified allowable gap will be censored at 
that point and follow -up will be discontinued.  A sensitivity  anal ysis will alsobe performed 
using a 14 day  treatment gap. 
9.3 VARIABLES
9.3.1 Exposures
Exposure to NOACs for the purpose of describing the potential study  population will be 
identified by  the presence of at least one prescription for dabigatran, rivaroxaban or apixaban. 
Please refer to Table 1in Appendix A for the corresponding codes to identify each therap y. 
As described in Section 9.11 Study  Population, the potential study  population will be divided 
into the following two cohorts based on NOAC exposure:
Dabigatran vs. Rivaroxaban: July  1, 2011 to June 30, 2016 
Dabigatran vs. Apixaban: December 28, 2012 to June 30, 2016
Standard dosing for each NOAC will be used for main anal yses. All doses for each NOAC 
will be combined for a sensitivity  analy sis.
9.3.2 Outcomes
The outcomes will be assessed during the post -index period for the two cohorts. If a patient 
discontinued the index NOAC or switched to a different NOAC, the outcomes assessment 
would not continue bey ond the date of discontinuation or the switch. The primary  and 
secondary  outcomes assessed will be safet y and effectiveness measures as described below in 
in the Outcomes of Interest table . 
The safet y and effectiveness anal ysis will be conducted for the following cohorts:

9.4 DATA SOURCES
The study  will use the Military  Health Sy stems (MHS) database .
The US Do Doperates the largest cradle -to-grave health care database in the US. The military  
database has over 30 billion archived records, including 5 billion online records spanning

001-MCS -90-124_RD -01(4.0)over 11 years for EMRs, 20 years of ePrescribing, and decades of prescription, inp atient, and 
outpatient data. Its size increases b y 230,000 outpatient encounters and 2,700 inpatient 
admissions every  day. As a single
-payer, full y budgeted $55 billion health care s ystem, there 
are uniform medical coverage and pharmacy  benefits for the 10 million active people served. 
The pharmacy  benefit in particular has minimal expenses for most patients, thus positioning 
the DOD as a dy namic platform for patient adherence. It is completel y free of expense for 
patients utilizing military treatment facil ities (MTF) and clinics. These data are commercially  
available onl y through .
The MHS provides 2 ty pes of care to its beneficiaries. I t provides direct care through a 
network of over 60 military  hospitals and 411 clinics and purchased care provided by  civilian 
providers financed through managed care contracts and fee- for-service reimbursements 
globall y. Direct care accounts for approximately 40% of the total care provided, with the 
balance being purchased from civilian providers. All the administrative events generated b y 
either a direct care or purchased care inpatient or outpatient encounter are centrally  processed 
into the MDR . Examples of the data recorded in such encounters include patient demographic 
data, provider information (provider ID, special ty, facility ), diagnostic codes (I CD-9 codes 
for outpatient; diagnosis-related group [DRG] codes for inpatient), and Current Procedural 
Terminology  (CPT) codes for any  procedures. Extensive information regarding the patient, 
including age, race, and gender , is also stored within the MDR via connections with the 
Defense Eligibility  Enrollment Reporting Sy stem (DEERS). The military  utilizes an 
electronic medication sy stem called the Pharmacy  Data Transaction Sy stem (PDTS). All the 
prescribing details of both direct care and purchased care outpatient medication orders, 
including mail order, are electronically  coded, including the prescribed drug name and NDC , 
dose, quantity , refills, and prescribing provider. All PDTS information is fed into the MDR. 
In additi on to feeding data into the MDR, direct care encounters conducted at MTFs utilize 
the military ’s EMR s ystem, called AHLTA. This robust EMR sy stem stores the entire 
encounter electronically  and is powered b y the MEDCIN®Engine; AHLTA is therefore 
designed w ith extensive variables documenting the individual components of an encounter, 
including s ymptoms, vital signs, history , phy sical exams, laboratory  and radiology  results, 
diagnostic codes, procedure codes, pharmacy  orders, and other orders such as specialt y 
consultation. The AHLTA dataset for each encounter is stored within the Clinical Data 
Repository  (CDR). Aspects of the CDR feed into the MDR, including vitals and lab results. 
Administrative information such as ICD -9 diagnoses, CPT codes, and pharmacy  orders for all 
direct care encounters are held in common by the CDR and MDR. The CDR is a transactional 
database required to provide millions of interactions every  day for hundreds of thousands of 
users.

9.5 STUDY SIZE
Given the non- interventional design, the stud y’s objective is not to demonstrate superiorit y of 
dabigatran vs. rivaroxaban or apixaban but rather to provide real -world estimates of the 
comparative effectiveness and safet y of dabigatran, rivaroxaban, a nd apixaban in a large US 
population of NVAF patients. Therefore, the planned anal yses are descriptive in nature and 
results of the statistical tests are to be interpreted in an exploratory  manner.
For each treatment comparison, the available sample size is determined by  feasibility  
assessments of the DoD database according to the pre- specified time window and 
inclusion/exclusion criteria, and not by  formal sample size justifications. Therefore, the 
purpose of the power assessments described in this sectio n is to illustrate the precision of the 
effect estimates that can be achieved given the feasible sample size. The primary safet y 
outcome of major bleeding was used for the power assessments, for which an annual event 
rate of 3.1% for the dabigatran patient s and a mean follow -up duration of 0.82 y ears for both 
groups were assumed based on the study  by Villines et al6. In addition, all calculations are 
based on a two
-sided test with α=0.05 and a 10% loss of dabigatran patients during the 1:1 
propensity  score matching.
For the anal ysis of dabigatran vs. rivaroxaban, it is estimated that a total of approximately  
41,000 patients (16,000 dabigatran vs. 25,000 rivaroxaban patients) will be available for this 
study , based on the proposed time window of July  2011 to March 2016. Power calculations 
suggest that such a sample size will allow the study  to detect a relative difference in the rate 
of major bleeding of 22% with 80% power, and 25% with 90% power, between the 
rivaroxaban and dabigatran groups.

001-MCS -90-124_RD -01(4.0)For the anal ysis of dabigatran vs. apixaban, it is estimated that a total of approximately  
27,000 patients (6,000 dabigatran and 21,000 apixaban patients) will be available for this 
study , based on the proposed time window of December 2012 to March 2016. Power 
calculati ons suggest that such a sample size will allow the study  to detect a relative 
difference 
in the rate of major bleeding of 37% with 80% power, and 43% with 90% power, between the 
apixaban and dabigatran groups. The analy sis may therefore have insufficient power to detect 
a smaller treatment difference if the expected sample size is confirmed. 
The actual power of the study  will be dependent on the actual event rate in each treatment 
group, the covariates included in the anal ysis models, and the actual loss of patients during 
matching, and may  therefore differ.
9.6 DATA MANAGEMENT
Access to the DoD data will be through a VPN connection. Through this secure connection 
 and will construct the study -specific anal ytic datasets. Data are 
checked for internal consistency  within each patient’s claims/records relevant to the study  
analyses and an y patients with extreme or unexpected treatment patterns or diagnoses are 
identified. BIPI will not have direct access to the raw data. All data management a nd 
statistical analy ses will be performed using SAS Version 9.4 (or later) in the secured 
environment
9.7 DATA ANALYSIS
All statistical analyses will be performed using SAS version 9.4 (SAS I nstitute, Cary , NC).
Baseline characteristics will be described for the two cohorts based on the NOAC treatment 
(dabigatran vs. rivaroxaban and dabigatran vs. apixaban) using standard summary  statistics. 
Means (±standard deviation, SD) and median (interquartile range) will be reported for 
continuous variables and frequenc ies (%) for categorical variables. The final study  sample 
will be newly  initiating cohorts.
To account for potential selection bias, the study  cohorts (dabigatran/rivaroxaban and 
dabigatran/apixaban) will be matched on their baseline characteristics using the propensity  
score matching (PSM) method.  The PSM aims to balance the two treatment group s on 
baseline demographics, health plan ty pe and clinical characteristics. The feasibility of PSM 
will be evaluated based on available sample size and descriptive results. If patient 
characteristics between dabigatran/rivaroxaban and dabigatran/apixaban co horts are 
significantl y different, i.e., less than 50% of patients in the dabigatran group can be matched 
to the rivaroxaban or apixaban group based on PSM, then the study  design will be re -
evaluated before proceeding to anal ysis. The Nearest Neighbor method of propensity  score 
matching within a caliper of 0.10 -0.20 (depending on resulting sample sizes) of the standard 
deviation of the estimated logit will be used to select the matched samples.

001-MCS -90-124_RD -01(4.0)The propensit y score will be defined as the probability  of bei ng treated with the index NOAC 
based on a set of baseline characteristics. If, for example, two patients, one in the dabigatran 
group and another in the rivaroxaban group , had the same propensity  score, they  would both 
have the same probability of being tr
eated with dabigatran. The final list of baseline 
characteristics to be utilized in the PSM will be decided in conjunction with BI. The 
following baseline characteristics in the pre -index period will be considered: age, gender, 
health plan ty pe, geographic region, month and year of index date, Charlson comorbidity  
index (CCI), stroke risk scores (i.e. CHADS 2or CHA 2DS 2-VASc), bleeding risk scores (i.e., 
modified HAS -BLED), relevant baseline comorbid conditions and medication use asdefined 
in Section 9.3.3. The distribution of baseline characteristics will be presented before and after 
the matching process. For baseline covariates that are not sufficiently  balanced after PSM , the 
covariates will be included in an appropriate multivariate model to adjust for those 
differences.
9.7.1 Main analysis
Patient demographics and clinical characteristics wil l be reported for NVAF patients by 
treatment groups: dabigatran, rivaroxaban, or apixaban. Stroke risk will be quantified using 
the CHADS 2 score, CHA 2DS 2-VASc score and bleeding risk through the HAS -BLED score. 
In addition, administrative variables of eligibility  time and post-index follow- up time will be 
described. Other descriptive variables may  include, but are not limited to, the f ollowing:

The follow -up period, which comprises the patient -time denominator, will start at index and 
will be censo red at the first occurrence of either of the following:
outcome event
therapeutic switch
index NOAC dose change
discontinuation of therapy , as defined as a gap in therapy  exceeding 30 days
end of DOD eligibility
end of study  period
Patients need at least two day s of exposure to the index NOAC to ensure they  had at least one 
day of index NOAC exposure in the post -index follow -up period.

001-MCS -90-124_RD -01(4.0)For patients, index exposure will be considered discontinued if there is a treatment gap longer 
than the 30 day  allowable gap specified from the end of the calculated days supplied.  
Patients that have treatment gap longer than the specified allowable gap will be censored at 
that point and follow -up will be discontinued.  A sensitivity  anal ysis will be performed on 
patients t hat have treatment gaps longer than 14days to determine if an adjustment to the gap 
days is necessary .
The first occurrence of each outcome will be identified, separately . For each outcome, event 
rates and 95% confidence intervals (CI) will be calculated using a person -time approach for 
each treatment and further stratified b y age and gender.  To compare the occurrence of each 
outcome between treatments, Kaplan -Meier anal ysis and Cox proportional hazards model 
analysis will be performed. Additional adjust ments will be made for baseline variables that 
are not sufficiently  balanced after PSM. 
Standard dosing for each NOAC will be used for main anal yses. Alldoses for 
each NOAC 
will be combined for a sensitivity  analy sis as defined below . 
9.8 QUALITY CONTROL
All amendments to the study  protocol will be discussed with and agreed upon by  the sponsor. 
Actual amendments to the study  protocol will be made by  the vendor and sent to BI PIfor 
review and approval. The date of the amendments will be documented on the cover page of 
the study  protocol. Amendments to the protocol will be submitted to the I nstitutional Review 
Board (I RB) for review and approval prior to implementation in accordance with regulatory  
requirements.
Clinicians from two MTFs, who are well versed in the standard of care for the NVAF 
population in the military  setting, will be available to provide oversight a nd feedback.

LIMITATIONS OF THE RESEARCH METHODS
Similar to other retrospective database studies, this study  is subject to limitations including 
coding errors of omission and commission, incomplete claims, unreliable clinical coding, and 
unobservable fac tors not equally  distributed in the treatment groups that may  also influence 
the outcomes. In addition, unrecognized confounding due to characteristics not measured or 
included in the PSM.
9.10 OTHER ASPECTS
Ethical Approval:
This study  will be conducted using a limited administrative claims database which full y 
complies with HI PAA. Institutional Review Board and Independent Ethics Committee 
approvals will be obtained for this study .
9.11 BIAS
As for an y observational study , there are man y potential sources of bias, and there may  be 
significant sources of bias that are not recognized. To minimize bias, this study  will include 
only patients who have not previously  been treated with novel oral anticoagulation, and will 
use propensit y score I PTW. Further, effort ha
s been made to avoid exclusions that may  
differentiall y affect the treatment groups, and be a potential bias.

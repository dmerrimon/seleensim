5 Synopsis  
Title  Systems Biology of Inactivated Rabies Vaccine in Healthy Adults With or 
Without Use of Broad Spectrum Antibiotics.  
Short Title  Responses to Rabies Vaccine in Adults with or without 
Antibiotics  
Rationale  Use of antibiotics can significantly impact the microbiota of patients. The 
status of the intestinal microbiome may impact the immune responses to 
vaccinations and alter functional protective immunity in humans. Here we 
hypothesize that the changes in the fecal microbiome induced by antibiotics 
translates into suboptimal antibody response to r abies vaccine.  
Clinical Phase  N/A 
Mechanistic Study  Yes

Accrual Objective  N=5-8 for phase 1  
N=24 for phase 2  
N=22 for phase 3  
Primary Study Objective  To compare antibody titers  after vaccination with Rabies vaccine in adults 
with or without use of antibiotics  
Study Design  Single center, mechanistic study with 3 phases in which subjects will be 
randomized to receive  one dose of Rabies vaccine at day 4 of a 5 day course 
of a specific ant ibiotic regimen (Group A) or Rabies vaccine  alone (Group B)  
followed by a second dose 28 days later  for both groups . The immune 
responses in the blood and the lymph node will be analyzed.  
Phase 1 of the study will determine the best strategy for sampling the 
lymph node (either by fine needle  aspiration (FNA) or by core needle 
 ____________________________________________________________________________________________  
6 biopsy); phase 2 of the study will determine  if there is a difference in 
antibody response in the blood in subjects receiving rabies vaccine with or 
without antibiotics. Phase 3 will compare the difference in immune resp onses in the blood and lymph node in subjects receiving rabies vaccine 
with or without antibiotics.    
Blood samples for immunologic testing will be collected at screening (from D -35 to D -2 ), on D0 (at vaccination), D1, D3, D7 (+/ - 1 day), D10 ( -2/+4), 
D14 (+/ - 2 day), D28  (+/- 5 days) , D29,  D35 (+/- 1 day), D38( -2/+4), D56 ( +/- 
5 days ), D180 (+/ - 14 days), D365 (+/ -14 days) post vaccination for both 
groups to study innate and/or adaptive immune responses. 
 
Stool samples will be collected in both groups at screening (from D - 35 to D 
-2), on D0 (at vaccination), D1, D3, D7 (+/ - 1 day), D10 ( -2/+4), D14 (+/ - 2 
day), D28 ( +/- 5 days), D29, D35 (+/- 1 day), D38( -2/+4),  D56 ( +/- 5 days ), 
D180 (+/ - 14 days), D365 (+/ -14 days)  post vaccination to study the gut 
microbiome.  
Antibiotics received by Group A will be started 3 days prior to vaccination (D-3) and continued on day of vaccination (D0) and for one day after 
vaccination (D1) for a total of 5 days . 
• Flagyl® 500 mg po tid  
• Vancocin® 125 mg po qid  
• Neomycin sulfate ® 500mg po tid  
The dosage of each antibiotic is taken from their respective package inserts and does not exceed the maximum dose allowed for each antibiotic. 
 
The antibiotic regimen is a broad spectrum regimen covering all types of fecal flora (anaerobes, gram positive, and gram negative bacteria); has a good safety record; has poor systemic absorption for part of the regimen (Vancocin® and Neomycin sulfate® ); and  part of the regimen is used to treat 
Clostridium difficile infections (Vancocin® and Flagyl®).  
 
Subjects in Group A a re asked to avoid all ethanol and any ethanol -
containing drugs while taking antibiotics and for 48h before and after taking the antibiotics.
 
Blood samples for safety laboratory testing (including CBC with differential, creatinine, potassium) will be collected at screening (from D -35 to D -2 ) and 
D 7 (+/ - 1 day) for both g roup s (phases 2 and 3) .
 
For Group A, stools will be screened for Clostridium difficile  carriage by PCR 
at screening (from D -35 to D-2).  
Lymph node sampling will be done once in phase 1. Lymph node sampling will be done in phase 3  10 days  after first and second vaccination s
 
Study Duration  Approximately  66 months  
Primary Endpoints  Comparison of antibody titers at D28 post first vaccination in both groups . 
Secondary Endpoints  Frequency, severity, and causality of all adverse events in Group A subjects  
and all adverse events related to sampling of the lymph node .

17 1 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
1.1 Background 
Vaccination has been one of the most important and cost -effective public health interventions to 
provide protection against infectious diseases.1 Since the introduction of the first vaccine in 1796, 
there ha ve been countless advances in the field. However, numerous gaps remain to be addressed. 
An important gap is understanding the mechanisms that lead to suboptimal immune responses to 
vaccination. It has been shown that the magnitude of the immune response produced by vaccines is highly variable among individuals, with both genetic and environmental factors playing  an important 
role. More recently, emphasis is being placed on the role of the microbiota in vaccine immunogenicity.
2 The microbiome is the collection of all microbial cells in and on the human body, 
with the majority being in the gastrointestinal tract. S tudies have shown that germ -free mice, or 
those treated with antibiotics, have a poorer immune response to infections as compared to mice with unaltered microbiota.
3 It has also been noted that the composition of the microbiome has the 
ability to affect B and T cell development, which are important aspects of the adaptive immune system and major responders to vaccination.
3  
 
A study on trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV) done by Oh et al. (Immunity, 2014) 
demonstrated the possible role of microbiota in enhancing vaccine immunity, supporting that the microbiome might be a determinant of vaccine efficacy.
4 They show that the immune response to 
TIV is reduced in mice that lack toll -like receptor 5 (TLR5), which is not a known sensor of viral stimuli, 
but is usually needed to respond to bacteria’s flagellin. This raised the question of the role of bacteria in modulating the immune response against viral vaccines. Therefore, they studied the immune response in germ -free mice and those that were treated with antibiotics, and found that the 
concentration of TIV -specific IgG and antigen- specific plasma cells in mice exposed to antibiotics was 
fairly reduced as compared to mice who were not exposed.
4 This further supported the idea that 
microbiota -derived fac tors contributed to TLR5 mediated augmentation of immunogenicity of TIV.4  
 Due to this link between microbiome and the immune system, it is important to further understand the impact of the microbiome on the immune response to vaccination. This can be done using 
systems vaccinology, which is the application of systems biology in vaccinology to predict vaccine 
 ____________________________________________________________________________________________  
18 efficacy.5 The aim is to find molecular signatures, or patterns of gene expression induced after 
vaccination, which can be used to correlate and predict the development of protective immunity.6 
The goal of our study is to determine whether alteration of microbiota by antibiotic exposure can 
negatively impact the immunogenicity of rabies vaccine, and to assess the innate and adaptive immune mechanisms r esponsible for that phenomenon. Imovax ® is an inactivated rabies vaccine 
harvested from infected human diploid cells. The reason behind choosing rabies vaccine in this study is using an antigen  that people are naïve to, unlike influenza vaccine which was used in our previous 
study. To track the response of the immune system to the vaccine, we will draw blood for peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMCs) isolation and perform a fine needle aspiration (FNA) or core needle 
biopsy  (CNB) of the draining lymph node, before and after vaccination. Sampling of the draining 
lymph node has been shown to be a sensitive way to analyze the effector memory T cell repertoire from the skin after administering an intradermal antigen.
7  
 In summary, the data from past experime nts in mice imply an important role for commensal 
microbiota in enhancing vaccine -elicited immunity. It is crucial to determine if these effects are also 
applicable in humans, with the ultimate goal of optimizing vaccine efficacy. Hence, we would like to translate the experimental data on mice to study the impact of antibiotic exposure in humans before 
vaccination on the elicited immune response to vaccines.  
1.2 Rationale and  Study Population  Selection  
The human microbiome plays an important role in the immune response to vaccination and can be altered by the use of antibiotics. Here, we attempt to better understand the immune responses to the inactivated rabies vaccines, with or without use of antibiotics, in subjects who are naïve to rabies vaccination or infe ction.  
Approximately  54 h ealthy adults with no co- morbid ities between the ages of 18 -49 years will be 
recruited from the general population of metro Atlanta and enrolled at the Hope Clinic, Decatur. The above age range was chosen in order to avoid the effect of immune senescence on vaccine efficacy and due to the fact that the rate of Clostr idium difficile  infection is lowest in the age ranged 
18-44 years, with less than 2.5 cases per 1,000 discharges.

 ____________________________________________________________________________________________  
19 1.3 Investigational Product(s)/Intervention (s)  
The vaccine used in the study will be the Imovax ® rabies vaccine manufactured by Sanofi Pasteur  
(PA, USA).9 Imovax ® is an inactivated rabies vaccine harvested from infected human diploid cells. 
Subjects in the study will receive the routine adult dose of 1.0 mL  given by the intramuscular (IM) 
route , in the deltoid muscle since vaccination in the gluteal area results in less neutralizing 
antibodies .9 Contrary to pre -exposure and post -exposure prophylaxis , where multiple doses of 
Imovax® rabies vaccine are recomme nded, o nly two 1.0 mL dose of Imovax ® will be given to 
participants, since seroprotection  is often obtained with only one dose  and the subjects are at no 
risk for acquiring rabies .9,10 Imovax ® will be obtained from the Emory Investigational Drug Service.  
The antibiotic regimen will be given 3 days prior to vaccination, on the vaccination day, and one day 
after vaccination for a total for 5 days.  The regimen will include the following antibiotics:  
Flagyl ® (11) (Pfizer, New York, NY) 500 mg po tid . 
Vancocin® ( 12) (ViroPharma, Exton, PA) 125 mg po qid . 
Neomycin sulfate ® (13) (X -Gen Pharmaceuticals, Big flats, NY) 500 mg po tid . 
All antibiotics will be obtained from the Emory Investigational Drug Service . 
1.4 Rationale for Selection of Investigational Product(s)/Intervention(s) 
and Regimen  
The majority of studies demonstrating that antibiotic -mediated depletion of host microbiota 
influence s the development and homeostasis of the immune system employed a specific cocktail of 
antibiotics consisting of Ampicillin (1 g/L), Neomycin (1 g/L), Vancomycin (0.5 g/L), and 
Metronidazole (0.5 g/L).  
The basis for using this particular combination of antibiotics is to enable a wide spectrum of microbial 
communities to be targeted for depletion. Indeed, at the indicated doses, this cocktail has been shown to effectively deplete more than 90% of the existing flora in the gut and drastically alter the compo sition of the microbiota.
14,15  
 ____________________________________________________________________________________________  
20 For this study , we will use a broad spectrum antibiotic regimen affecting all bacteria in the gut flora 
based on our mice experiments that includes:  Vancocin® (with activity against gram positive 
bacteria), Flagyl® (with activity against anaerobes) and Neomycin sulfate® (with activity against gram 
negative bacteria).  
Additional characteristics of antibiotics selected in the regimen include:  
- Poor sy stemic absorption for Vancocin® and Neomycin sulfate® (3%) when given orally which 
should result in less systemic side effects.  
- Good safety profile for all 3 of these antibiotics used for more than half a century (Flagyl® was developed in 1960, Vancocin®  in 1953 and Neomycin sulfate® in 1949).  
- Although any antibiotic can cause Clostridium difficile -associated colitis, the current regimen 
includes Vancocin® and Flagyl®, both used at the same cumulative daily dosage to treat Clostridium difficile  infectio n but administered in a shorter course of 5 days. For Neomycin 
sulfate®, the cumulative daily dosages are less than half of the minimum daily dosage used to treat adult hepatic encephalopathy and a 5- day course is same as that required for treating 
adult hepatic encephalopathy.  
This antibiotic regimen (Vancocin®, Flagyl® and Neomycin sulfate®) will be administered three days before vaccination with rabies vaccine , on the day of vaccination and one day post -vaccination in 
subjects randomized to the antibioti c group . This short course reduces the potential risk of bacterial 
and fungal superinfection, as well as preventing the development of antibiotic resistance.  
1.5 Risks  
1.5.1 Risks of Investigational Product(s)/Intervention(s)  
Rabies vaccine (Imovax ®) 
The potential risks of receiving the rabies vaccine include but are not limited to: local reactions such as pain, erythema, soreness, swelling or itching at injection site (25%), systemic reactions such 
as headache, nausea, abdominal pain, muscle aches and  dizziness (20%) and anaphylactic 
reactions.
9  
 ____________________________________________________________________________________________  
21 Serum sickness type reactions have been reported in persons receiving booster dose (7%) ; this 
protocol will  provide 2  instead of 3  dose s of the vaccine . Also, rare cases of a transient 
neuroparalytic illness have been reported, which resolved without sequ ela in 12 weeks, as well a 
focal subacute central nervous system disorder temporally associated with rabies vaccine. All 
systemic neuroparalytic or anaphylactic reactions to a rabies vac cine should be immediately 
reported to VAERS or Sanofi Pasteur Inc .9  
There may be other unknown side effects.  
Antibiotics  
Exposure to antibiotics poses a risk for Clostridium difficile infection (CDI), typically resulting in a mild illness with diarrhea, fever and abdominal pain. Severe cases of CDI have resulted in hospital admissions, colectomy, and deaths, mostly in patients with co -morbidities or the elderly. We 
excluded antibiotics with which CDI has been highly associated with, such as fluoroquinolon es. 
Flagyl®: The most serious adverse reactions reported in patients treated with Flagyl® have been 
convulsive seizures, encephalopathy, aseptic meningitis, optic and peripheral neuropathy.
11 
Peripheral neuropathy is characterized mainly by numbness or par esthesia of an extremity.11 The 
most common adverse reactions reported have been referable to the gastrointestinal tract, particularly nausea, reported by approximately 12% of patients, and can be accompanied by headache, anorexia, and occasionally vomiting; diarrhea; epigastric distress; and abdominal cramping.
11   
Vancocin®: Nephrotoxicity (renal failure, renal impairment, blood creatinine increased) has occurred 
following oral Vancocin ® therapy in randomized controlled clinical studies, and can occur eit her 
during or after completion of therapy. The risk of nephrotoxicity is increased in patients >65 years of age.
12  
Ototoxicity has occurred in patients receiving vancomycin.12 It may be transient or permanent, but 
has been reported mainly in patients who have been given excessive intravenous doses, who have an underlying hearing loss, or who are receiving concomitant therapy with another ototoxic agent, such as an aminoglycoside.
12  
 ____________________________________________________________________________________________  
22 The most common (>10%) adverse reactions associated with the use of Vancocin® in clinical trials 
included nausea (17%), abdominal pain (15%) and hypokalemia (13%). Other adverse events (>5%) included peripheral edema, fatigue, fever, diarrhea, vomiting, flatulence, urinary tract infection, back pain and headache. Also, imp ortant/life -threatening side effects are rare (<1%) and include vasculitis, 
thrombocytopenia, nephrotoxicity, neurotoxicity and ototoxicity.
12   
Neomycin sulfate®:  Nephrotoxicity, ototoxicity, and neuromuscular blockage have been reported 
with the use of Neomycin sulfate®.13 Manifestations of neurotoxicity may include numbness, skin 
tingling, muscle twitching, and convulsions. The risk of hearing loss continues after drug withdrawal. Subjects concurrently receiving other neurotoxic and/or nephrotoxic drugs may have can have a possible enhancement of the nephrotoxicity and/or ototoxicity of neomycin.
13 Concurrent or serial 
use of other aminoglycosides and polymyxins may enhance neomycin’s nephrotoxicity and/or ototoxicity and potentiate neomycin sulfate’s neu romuscular blocking effects.  The most common 
adverse reactions to oral neomycin sulfate are nausea, vomiting and diarrhea.
13   
All three antibiotics in this regimen can lead to the overgrowth of non -susceptible bacteria.  
Lidocaine16:  
Complications of lido caine ( 1%) injection used for local anesthesia are rare, mostly seen if a major 
vessel is inadvertently injected, the recommended dose is exceeded, or as an idiosyncratic response. The immediate side effects are related to the central nervous system ( light headedness, 
confusion, tinnitus, blurred or double vision, vomiting, numbness, twitching, tremors, convulsions, unconsciousness, respiratory depression and arrest ) and cardiovascular system (decreased 
myocardial contractility, vasodilation, arrhythmias and  cardiac arrest). Allergy to lidocaine either 
immediate (urticaria or anaphylaxis) or delayed (contact dermatitis) has been described.  In adults , 
the recommended dose is 7 mg/kg with a maximum of 500 mg.  
1.5.2 Risk of Study Procedure  
The potential risks to subjects are those associated with intramuscular administration of the rabies vaccine, possible reactions to the vaccine, having blood drawn, the risks associated with fine needle aspiration cytology or  core needle lymph node biopsy,  and exposure to antibiotics.  
Blood draws:  
 ____________________________________________________________________________________________  
23 Blood sample collection involves transient discomfort and may cause fainting, which is managed by 
having the subject lie down prior. The blood draw site may bruise, and this can be ameliorated by holding pressure to this site following the blood draw. The sites of blood draw are potential sites of infection, but this risk is made very unlikely by the use of sterile technique.  
Fine needle aspiration  (FNA)  or core needle biopsy (CNB) of the lymph node:  
The potential risks for fine needle aspiration and core needle biopsy are rare. They include, but are 
not limited to: tenderness around aspiration site, bruising, bleeding and hematoma formation, as 
well as much rarer complications: infection, allergic reaction to anesthetic, vagal reaction, numbness caused by accidental nerve damage, and pneumothorax .
17-19 
1.5.3 Risk of Concomitant Medications, Prophylactic Medications and Rescue 
Medications  
We do not anticipate the use of any other medication; however, should anaphylactic or hypersensitivity reactions occur, epinephrine (1:1000) and diphenhydramine injections are readily available at the Hope Clinic during vaccine use.  
Epinephrine injection can be associated with high blood pressure, arrhythmia, lightheadedness, nervousness, restlessness, tremor, shortness of breath and diaphoresis. The frequency of these side 
effects is not defined. Diphenhydramine injection may be required to treat possible allergic reactions and its use can be associated with low blood pressure, arrhythmia, confusion, dizziness, sedation , 
restlessness, diarrhea, nausea and urinary retention. The frequency of these side effects is also not defined.  
When facing a medical emergency, the clinic staff will follow the institutional SOP by calling 911 first  
(Hope Clinic) or a code t o the hospita l on call team ( Winship Cancer Institute ). If needed, the subject 
will be transferred to Emory University Emergency Department for further care.  
Subjects are allowed to use acetaminophen if they experience a moderate to severe local or systemic side effect s after vaccine administration . Subjects are allowed to use acetaminophen if they 
experience a moderate to severe local or systemic side effects after lymph node sampling .

24 1.6 Benefits  
1.6.1 Benefits of Investigational Product(s)/Intervention(s)  
The benefit for the study is predominantly scientific, allowing a better understanding of the role of 
the microbiome in the immune response to vaccination  and the immune responses in the blood 
and the draining lymph node. However, individuals who receive this vaccine will hav e some level of 
protection from potential future rabies exposures .  
1.6.2 Benefits of Study Procedure(s)  
None.  
 ____________________________________________________________________________________________  
25 2 OBJECTIVES  
Use of antibiotics can significantly impact the microbiota of patients. The status of the intestinal 
microbiome may impact the immune responses to vaccinations and alter functional protective immunity in humans. Here we hypothesize that the changes in the fecal microbiome induced by antibiotics translates into suboptimal rabies antibody  titers.  
2.1 Primary  Objective (s) 
• Compare antibody  titers after vaccination with r abies vaccine in adults with or without use 
of antibiotics.  
2.2 Secondary Objectives  
• Evaluate the s afety profile of the different antibiotics and the lymph node sampling methods . 
2.3 Exploratory Objectives  
• Analyze the microbiome in both groups.  
• Analyze the repertoire and monoclonal antibodies from plasmablasts in a subset of vaccinees 
in both groups.   
• Identify innate immune signatures (traditional immune parameters measurements + array -
based gene expression) and correlate signatures with antibody  titers at several times points  
in both groups.  
• Compare the immune profiling in the blood and the lymph node at different time  points after 
vaccination.  
 ____________________________________________________________________________________________  
26 3 STUDY DESIGN  
This is a single center, mechanistic study with 3 phases in which subjects will be randomized to 
receive one dose of r abies vaccine at day 4 of a 5 day course of a specific antibiotic regimen (Group 
A) or r abies vaccine alone (Group B) ; all subject will re ceive a second dose of rabies vaccine 28 
days later after the first vaccine . The immune responses in the blood and the lymph node will be 
analyzed.  
Phase 1 of the study will determine the best strategy for sampling the lymph node (either by FNA or CNB ). The best timing of sampling is determined by phase 2 of the study and if there is a 
difference in antibody response in the blood in subjects receiving rabies vaccine with or without antibiotics. Phase 3 will compare the difference in immune responses in the blood and lymph node in subjects receiving rabies vaccine with or without antibiotics.    
Blood samples for immunologic testing will be collected at screening (from D - 35 to D - 2), on D0 
(at vaccination), D1, D3, D7 (+/ - 1 day),  D10 (-2/+4), D14 (+/ - 2 day), D28 (+/ - 5 days), D29,  D35 
(+/-1 day), D 38(- 2; +4) D56 (+/ - 5 days), D180 (+/ - 14 days) , D365 ( +/- 14 day s) post vaccination 
for both groups to study innate and/or adaptive immune responses. 
 
Stool samples will be collected in both groups at screening (from D - 35 to D - 2), on D0 (at 
vaccination), D1, D3, D7 (+/ - 1 day),  D10 (-2/+4),  D14 (+/ - 2 day), D28 (+/ - 5 days), D29,  D35 (+/ -
1 day), D 38(- 2; +4); D56 (+/ - 5 days), D180 (+/ - 14 days) , D365 ( +/- 14 day s) post vaccination to 
study the gut microbiome.  
Antibiotics received by Group A will be started 3 days prior to vaccination (D -3) and continued 
on day of vaccination (D0) and for one day after vaccination (D1) for a total of 5 days . 
o Flagyl® 500 mg po tid  
o Vancocin® 125 mg po qid  
o Neomycin sulfate® 500mg po tid  
The dosage of each antibiotic is taken from their respective package inserts and does not exceed the maximum dose allowed for each antibiotic. 
 
The antibiotic regimen is a broad spectrum regimen covering all types of fecal flora (anaerobes, gram positive, and gram negative bacteria); has a good safety record; has poor systemic absorption for part of the  regimen (Vancocin® and Neomycin sulfate®); and part of the regimen 
is used to treat Clostridium difficile infections (Vancocin® and Flagyl®).  
 
 ____________________________________________________________________________________________  
27 Subjects in Group A are asked to avoid all ethanol and any ethanol -containing drugs while taking 
antibiotics and for 48h before and after taking the antibiotics.  
Blood samples for safety laboratory testing (including CBC with differential, creatinine, potassium) 
will be collected at screening (from D -35 to D - 2) and D 7 (+/ - 1 day) for both groups (ph ases 2 and 
3).  
 For Group A, stools will be screened for Clostridium difficile  carriage by PCR at screening (from D -
35 to  D-2).  
Lymph node sampling will be done once in phase 1. Lymph node sampling will be done 2 times in 
phase 3 10 days after first and second vaccination s .

Note:   
*An individual who initially is excluded from study participation based on one or more of the time -
limited exclusion criteria (e.g., acute illness, receipt or expected receipt of live or inactivated vaccines) may be reconsidered for enrollment once the condition has resolved as long as the subject continues to meet all other entry criteria.  ** Grade 4 hypertension per CTCAE criteria is defined as Life -threatening consequences (e.g., 
malignant hypertension, transient or permanent neurologic deficit, hyperte nsive).  
***Subjects receiving > 20 mg/day of prednisone or its equivalent daily or on alternate days fo r more 
than 2 weeks may enter the study after therapy has been discontinued for more than 3 months.  
**** Subjects are excluded if on high dose intranasal steroids defined as > 960 mcg/day of 
beclomethasone dipropionate or equivalent.  
4.5 Early Study Termination  
Subjects may be terminated prior to study completion from the study for the following reasons:  
A. The subject elects to withdraw consent from all future study activities, including follow -up. 
 ____________________________________________________________________________________________  
34 B. The subject is considered by the PI to be “lost to follow -up” (i.e., no further follow -up is possible 
because attempts to reestablish contact with the subject have failed).  
C. The subject dies.  
D. The subject develops a medical condition or is started on new medication(s) not previously 
mentioned in the list of prohibited medications that, in the opinion of the investigator, may pose additional risks from participation in the study, may interfere with the subject’s ab ility to comply 
with study requirements, or may impact the quality of the data obtained from the study.  
E. Blood is not able to be drawn (for technical or other reasons) or the subject does not tolerate multiple blood draw attempts.  
F. As deemed necessary by the  PI or her designee for noncompliance of any nature.  
G. As deemed necessary by the PI after development of a related AE/SAE.  
H. The subject becomes pregnant.  
Subjects with early termination status are  replaced as needed to preserve the statistical power 
needed to substantiate the primary endpoint (Refer to section 9.1).  
Note:  
Up to the discretion of the PI, subjects receiving concomitant medications may still continue with scheduled study blood draws. Subjects receiving concomitant medications along with subjec ts with 
early termination from this study for any reason may be replaced as needed to preserve the statistical power needed to substantiate the primary endpoint. (Refer to section 9.1)

35 5 INVESTIGATIONAL PRODUCT(S)/INTERVENTION MATERIAL(S), 
OTHER STUDY PRODUC TS (CONTROLS/PLACEBOS)  
5.1 Investigational Product(s)/Intervention(s)  
The Emory Investigational Drug Service will purchase Imovax ® (Sanofi Pasteur, PA , USA).  The Emory 
Investigational Drug Service will store the vaccines and will monitor temperatures of the 
refrigerator(s) containing the vaccines. All antibiotics (Flagyl® (Pfizer, New Y ork, NY); Vancocin® 
(ViroPharma , Exton, PA); Neomycin sulfate® (X -Gen Pharmaceuticals, Big Flats, NY)) will be 
purchased as well.  Also, lidocaine 1 % is use d for local anesthesia. Refer to section 1. 5, and applicable 
product labeling, for known and potential risks to human subjects associated with the investigational 
product(s) intervention(s).  
5.1.1 Preparation, administration and dosage  
Imovax ® Rabies Vaccine  
Imovax® rabies vaccine is produced by Sanofi Pasteur SA. It is prepared from the PM -1503- 3M strain, 
and is a stable, sterile , freeze -dried suspension of the rabies virus. The virus is harvested from 
infected human diploid cells and inactivated by beta -prop iolactone. The suspension contains less 
than 150 mcg neomycin sulfate, less than 100 mg human albumin, 20 mcg of phenol red indicator 
and less than 50 parts per million of residual beta -propiolactone. After reconstitution, the full 1.0 mL 
vaccine should be  administered immediately intramuscularly. If not given promptly, it should be 
discarded. The potency of one dose is equivalent to or greater than 2.5 international units of rabies antigen.  
5.2 Antibiotics administration and dosage  
All antibiotics will be self- administered by the subject by mouth from D -3 until D1 (total of 5 days) as 
stated below:  
• Flagyl® 500 mg po tid  
 ____________________________________________________________________________________________  
36 • Vancocin® 125 mg po qid  
• Neomycin sulfate ® 500mg po tid  
5.3 Accountability of Investigational Product(s)/Intervention(s)  
Under Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations (21CFR §312.62), the investigator will maintain 
adequate records of the disposition of the investigational product(s)/intervention material(s), including the date and quantity of the drug received, to whom the drug was dispensed (subject -by-
subject accounting), and a detailed accounting of any investigational product(s)/intervention material(s) accidentally or deliberately destroyed.  
Records for receipt, storage, use, and disposition will be maintained by the study site. A  dispensing 
log will be kept current for each subject. This log will contain the identification of each subject, the name of the vaccine administered to the subject, the lot of vaccine received by the subject and the date and quantity of vaccine dispensed.  A similar log is available for antibiotics dispensed for 
subjects. A pill count is performed on D0, D1 and D3  to record compliance to the antibiotic regimen. 
All records regarding the disposition of the investigational product(s)/intervention material(s) will be 
available for inspection by the site monitor and the health authorities.  
5.4 Assessment of Compliance with Investigational 
Product(s)/Intervention Material(s)  
The number of used vaccine syringes will be tracked and reconciled by the Emory Investigation al 
Drug Service.  
5.5 Modification or Discontinuation of Investigational 
Product(s)/Intervention Material(s)  
5.5.1 Modification of Investigational Product(s)/Intervention(s)  
Unless Imovax®  or any of the antibiotics  and lidocaine  are recalled by the manufacturers, the re will 
be no discontinuation of administration of study vaccine,  antibiotics  or local anesthesia.

 ____________________________________________________________________________________________  
38 6 OTHER MEDICATIONS  
6.1 Concomitant Medications  
In accordance with exclusion criteria, subjects expected to receive prohibited medications (see 
section 6.4) will be considered ineligible for the study. All medications, therapi es, or vaccines 
administered to study subjects after study entry will be documented at each visit.  
6.2 Prophylactic Medications  
Prophylactic medications will not be administered before vaccination or any other study procedures.  
6.3 Rescue Medications  
We do not anticipate the use of any rescue medication; however, should anaphylactic or hypersensitivity reactions occur, epinephrine (1:1000) and diphenhydramine injections are readily available at the Hope Clinic during vaccine use  and at Winship Cancer Institute during lymph node 
sampling . 
When facing a medical emergency, the clinic staff will follow the institutional SOP by calling 911 first (Hope Clinic) or a code to the hospital on call team (Winship Cancer Institute). If needed, the subject will be transferred to Emory University Emergency Department for further care.  
Subjects are allowed to use acetaminophen if they experience a moderate to severe local or systemic side effect after vaccine administration or acetaminophen if they experience a moderate to severe local or systemic side effect after lymph node sampling.  
6.4 Concomitant Study Medications  
All medications and vaccines received by study subjects after administration of study vaccine should be reported to the study staff and recorded.  This includes, but is no t limited to, the following:  
• blood products, chemotherapy, immunosuppressive therapy (including anti -INF therapy), 
and radiation therapy (administered at any time after study vaccination).  
 ____________________________________________________________________________________________  
39 • inactivated vaccines  (administered before the day 14  blood draw ). 
• live-attenuated vaccine  (administered before the day 28  blood draw) .  
• any antibiotic aside from the study antibiotic (taken before the day 28  blood draw).  
• any probiotics and preb iotics (taken before the day 28  blood draw).  
• any proton pump inhibitors, H2 receptor blockers, or antacids (taken before the day 28  
blood draw).  
Any of the above medications could affect the innate , adaptive , or microbiome  assay results and 
should not be used unless medically indicated.  
Upon the discretion of the PI, subjects receiving concomitant medications may still continue with 
scheduled study blood draws. Subjects receiving concomitant medications and early terminated subjects may be replaced as needed to preserve the statistical power needed to substantiate t he 
primary endpoint (refer to section 9.1 ). 
 ____________________________________________________________________________________________  
40 7 STUDY VISITS AND PROCEDURES  
7.1 Enrollment and Randomization  
This research study will be explained in lay terms to each potential research subject. The potential 
subject will sign an informed consent form before undergoing any screening study procedures. Subjects who are deemed eligible for the study (see sections 4.1 , 4.2, 4.3 and 4.4) will be enrolled 
and assigned a unique subject number. Enrollment will occur over an appro ximate 24 -month time 
span.  The duration of  participation for each subject is approximately 13 months . 
Approximately  54 subjects will be included in the study, which occurs in three phases:  
Phase 1  
Five to eight  subjects will u ndergo both fine needle aspiration (FNA) and core  needle biopsy (CNB ) of 
the axillary lymph node  during one single visit  after screening . No vaccine will be given to these 
participants. A phone call will be done to ensure subject did not have significant adverse event from 
the procedure. This will help determine the preferred method of lymph node sampling that will yield the greatest amount of information on the immune response to the vaccine with the lowest rate of adverse events.  
Phase 2  
Approximately eighteen subjects will be randomized to Group A (receiving antibiotics) o r to Group B 
(not receiving antibiotics) in a 1:1 ratio. All eligible subjects will receive Imovax®  at D0  and D28. No 
FNA was performed as part of Phase 2 . 
Phase 3  
Approximately t wenty -two subjects will be randomized to Group A (receiving antibiotics) or to Group 
B (not receiving antibiotics) in a 1:1 ratio. Approximately 6 subjects in each arm will undergo lymph node sampling at ( 10 days  after the first and second vaccination s). 
 ____________________________________________________________________________________________  
41 7.2 Screening Visit(s) (F rom D -35 until D -2) 
Subjects responding to study ads will contact  the Hope Clinic for a telephone screening where the 
eligibility criteria of the subject will be reviewed. If the subject is found to be eligible and continues 
to be interested in participating after reading the informed consent (emailed or mailed to him/her), a screening appointment will be scheduled. Study staff will review the informed consent form with the subject and will answer all questions related to the study.  
Once the subject signs the informed consent, a study participation number will be assigned. The volunteer will be asked to provide demographic information and information related to his/her medical history, including current medication use and vaccination history. The subject’s vital signs will be recorded, and a targeted physical exam will be conducted as indicated, based on review of the subject’s health status. For female volunteers who are of childbearing potential, a urine pregnancy test will be performed. Only females with a negative urine pregnancy test  will be enrolled 
in the study.  
All other study procedures will differ depending on the group (A vs B) and if lymph node sampling is planned or not.  
Phase 1:  No safety labs . 
Phase 2 : Eighteen subjects will be randomized  into two groups in a 1:1 ratio.  Group A will be the 
group receiving antibiotics, and Group B will be the group  not receiving antibiotics . All subjects 
(Groups A and B) will have blood drawn for safety labs (CBC with differential, creatinine, pot assium). 
All subjects (Groups A and B) will have a stool sample collected from them . Nine subjects (Group A ) 
will be given the three antibiotics and instructed on when and how to start taking the antibiotic pills (D-3 until D1) . Subjects in Group A are asked to call the Hope Clinic for any symptom while on 
antibiotics.  
Phase 3 : Twenty -two subjects will be randomized into two groups in a 1:1 ratio. A ll subjects (Groups 
A and B) will have blood drawn for safety labs (to measure CBC with differential, creatinine, potassium ) and approximately 6 will undergo a  FNA 10 days after the first and second vaccinations /. 
All subjects will have a stool sample collected from them. Subjects in Group A will also be given the 
 ____________________________________________________________________________________________  
42 three antibiotics and instructed on when and how to start taking the antibiotic pills (D -3 until D1). 
Subjects in Group A are asked to call the Hope Clinic for any  symptom while on antibiotics.  
This visit will last approximately 60 minut es to 120 minutes . 
7.3 Procedure (screening period or other time  points)  
Study personnel will first review the subject’s current health status, list of medications being taken, 
and note any change since the screening visit. The subject’s vital signs will be recorded. For female 
volunteers of childbearing potential, a urine pregnancy test will be performed. Only females with a 
negative urine pregnancy test will get the procedure. Inclusion/exclusion criteria will be also verified before procedure . Subject will have a lymph node sampling (subjects in phase 1 will undergo both 
CNB  and FNA, subjects in phase  3 a FNA, as determined by phase 1 ). 
Phase 1: All subjects will undergo both FNA and CNB  at D0 after screening.  
Phase 2: No lymph node sampling  
Phase 3: A pproximately 6 subjects  from e ach group  (Groups A and B) will undergo lymph node 
sampling  at 10 days after the first and second vaccination s). 
 Tissue sampling of an axillary lymph node will be carried out percutaneously. The subjects will undergo FNA and/or CNB . Both procedures involve obtaining informed consent, performing a pre -
procedure “time out” with the team and subject present to confirm identity subject and the nature of the procedure. Both axillae  will be scanned with ultrasound to identify the most accessible node 
for biopsy.  Once this has been identified, the skin will be sterilely prepared, and l idocaine 1% will be 
injected intra -dermally and subcutaneously to the margin of the node in question, to confer local 
anesthesia. A small skin incision will be made. Under real- time sonographic guidance, a 21 -gauge 
needle (FNA) or an 18 -gauge Bard Marquee automated core biopsy device (core biopsy) (Bard Biopsy, 
Tempe, AZ) will be placed. For FNA, 2 -4 passes will be made to retrieve cytologic material. For core 
biopsy 3 -4 passes will b e made to retrieve histologic core samples. After tissue is retrieved, manual 
pressure will be applied to the biopsy site for 5- 10 minutes. The technologist will review post -
procedure instructions with the patient. The incision site will be sterilely dressed and the patient will be released after vital signs are checked . 
 ____________________________________________________________________________________________  
43 At the end of the visit, the subject will also be instructed to promptly call the site if he/she develops 
any of the following: 
• Illness or treatment from a physician or emergency department ; and/or hospitalization due to a 
complication from the lymph node sampling;  
• Development of any adverse event that limits self- care activities of daily living (e.g.  bathing, 
dressing and undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, taking medications, and not bed ridden) even if he/she decides not to seek medical care.  
Refer to section 8.2 for safety data that must be recorded and reported.  
Note:  Subjects calling the site for any of the above will receive further instructions on the proper course of action, including a return to the clinic for immediate evaluation, if appropriate.  
This visit will last approximately 120 minutes.  
7.4 Vaccination  visit (D0 and D28 ) 
Study personnel will first review the subject’s current health status, list of medications being taken, and note any change since the screening visit. The subject’s vital signs will be recorded and a targeted physical exam will be conducted, as indicated by a review of the subject’s health status. For female volunteers of childbearing potential, a urine pregnancy test will be performed. Only females with a negative urine pregnancy test will receive the vaccine. Inclusion/exclusion criteria will be also verified 
before vaccination. Subjects receiving antibiotics  will be asked if they have had any symptoms since 
starting antibiotics , and a pill count is performed . 
Blood for immunological assays will be drawn at this visit before administration of the vaccine as well 
as stool collection . The inactivated rabies vaccine ( Imovax® ) will be administered intr amuscularly in 
the deltoid region of the preferred arm of the participant. To ensure safety, each subject will be observed  for a minimum of 15 minutes following vaccination to note the occurrence of any immediate 
hypersensitivity reactions. After 15 minutes, the injection site will be examined by study personnel  
and subject will be asked for systemic adverse reactions.  
 ____________________________________________________________________________________________  
44 The subject will be provided with a written description of local and systemic vaccine reactions of mild, 
moderate and severe intensity (Refer to Appendix B and Appendix C ).  
At the end of the visit, the subject will also be instructed to promptly call the site if he/she develops any of the following: 
• Illness or treatment from a physician or emergency department; and/or hospitalization due to 
any illness throughout the entire duration of the study; 
• Development of any adverse event that limits self- care activities of daily living (e.g. bathing, 
dressing and undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, taking medications, and not bed ridden) even if he/she decides not to seek  medical care;  
• For subjects receiving antibiotics: development of any of the following symptoms while on 
antibiotics and throughout the duration of the study:  
o diarrhea (≥ 3 unformed stools/24h) for more than 72h with either fever or abdominal pain*  
o tinnitus**  
o vertigo**  
o decrease hearing**  
o numbness/tingling**  
• Beginning or  discontinuing any medications/therapies during enrollment in the study.  
Refer to section 8.2 for  safety data that must be recorded and reported.  
Note: Subjects calling the site for any of the above will receive further instructions on the proper 
course of  action, including a return to the clinic for immediate evaluation, if appropriate.  
This visit will last approximately 60 minutes.  
Note:  
*If C difficile  infection is suspected, C difficile  PCR testing will be performed. If positive, treatment 
and follow u p for C difficile infection will be facilitated.  
** if tinnitus, vertigo, decrease hearing, numbness/tingling are present, medical referral will be facilitated.  
 ____________________________________________________________________________________________  
45 7.5 In-Person Follow- Up Visits  
Phase 1: No follow -up visits are required for subjects from phase 1.

46 A focused physical exam will be conducted (if indicated) based on results of the review of the 
subject’s health status as  outlined above.  
Note:  
*If C difficile  infection is suspected, C. difficile  PCR testing will be performed. If positive, 
treatment and follow up for C. difficile infection will be facilitated.  
** if tinnitus, vertigo, decrease hearing, numbness/tingling ar e present, medical referral will be 
facilitated.  
7.6 Telephone Follow- Up Visits  
Phase 1: A  telephone visit will occur 7 days (+/ -2 days) after lymph node sampling unless the subject 
has a predefined  in person visit to the clinic.  
Phases 2 and 3: A telephone visit will occur for subjects who received antibiotics (group A) at D-3 and  
D-2 to inquire if subject started taking antibiotics and if he/she  is tolerating them.   A telephone visit 
will occur for subjects who received antibiotics (group A) at D90 (+/ - 14 days) to ensure they have 
not developed C. difficile infection.  For subjects in phase 3 that undergo FNA, will have 2 additional 
telephone visits 7 (+/ -2) days after each  FNA procedure  unless the subject has a predefined in person 
visit to the clinic .

be seen in clinic, if necessary.  
8.1.5 SUBJECT REPLACEMENT  
In the case of premature termination  (before D28 samples are obtained ), extra patients will be 
recruited , at the discretion of the principle investigator, to maintain the target sample size and 
the statistical power to substantiate primary endpoint. Please refer to section 9 - Statistical 
Analysis.  
 ____________________________________________________________________________________________  
50 8.2 Adverse Events  
This section defines the types of adverse events that may occur, and outlines the procedures for 
appropriately adverse event collecting, grading, recording, and reporting.   
Information in this section complies with 21CFR 312; ICH Guideline E2A: Clinical Safety Data Management: Definitions and Standards for Expedited Reporting and ICH E6: Guideline for Good Clinical Practice; and applies the standards set forth in the National Cancer Institute (NCI), Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Version 4.0 [Published: May 28, 2009; revised version 4.03; 
June 14. 2010, http://evs.nci.nih.gov/ftp1/CTCAE/About.html]  
These criteria have been reviewed by the study investigators and have been determined to be appropriate for this study population.  
8.2.1 Safety Reporting  
8.2.1.1 Adverse Events (AE)  
Adverse event means any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether or not considered drug related.  
An adverse event (also referred to as an adverse experience) can be any unfavorable and unintended sign (e.g., an abnormal laboratory finding),  symptom, or disease temporally 
associated with the use of a drug, without any judgment about causality. An adverse event can arise from any use of the drug (e.g., off- label use, use in combination with another drug) and from 
any route of administration, formulation, or dose, including an overdose.  
Any grade 2 adverse event until D28 will be recorded  and reported .  
8.2.1.2  Suspected Adverse Reaction (SAR)  
Suspected adverse reaction means any adverse event for which there is a reasonable possibility that the drug c aused the adverse event.  
Suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser degree of certainty about causality than adverse reaction, which means any adverse event caused by a drug.  
 ____________________________________________________________________________________________  
51 SARs after vaccine administration may include:  
• Local reactions: hardening of the skin at the injection site, injection site redness, 
injection site swelling, pain at the site of injection, bruising of the skin at the injection site.  
• Systemic reactions: aching muscles, headache, fever, nausea/vomiting, dizziness .   
8.2.1.3  SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT (SAE) OR SERIOUS SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTION  
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered ‘‘serious’’ if, in the view of the 
investigator, it results in any of the following outcomes:  
• Death . 
• A life -threatening adver se event . 
• Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization . 
• A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct 
normal life functions . 
• A congenital anomaly/birth  defect.  
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospitalization may be considered serious when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to preven t one of 
the outco mes listed in this definition.  Serious adverse events will  be reported and recorded for 
the entire duration of the study.  
Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in 
an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias, or convulsions that do not result in inpatient 
hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
 ____________________________________________________________________________________________  
52 8.2.1.4 Life-Threatening Adverse Event or Life-Threatening Suspected Adverse Reaction  
An adverse event or suspected adve rse reaction is considered ‘‘life -threatening’’ if, in the view of 
the investigator, its occurrence places the patient or subject at immediate risk of death.  
It does not include an adverse event or suspected adverse reaction that, had it occurred in a mor e 
severe form, might have caused death.  
8.2.1.5  Unexpected Adverse Event or Unexpected Suspected Adverse Reaction  
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered ‘‘unexpected’’ if it is not listed in 
the Summary of Product Characteristics or is not l isted at the specificity or severity that has been 
observed; or, if the Summary of Product Characteristics is not required or available, is not 
consistent with the risk information described in the general investigational plan or elsewhere in the current application, as amended.  
For example, under this definition, hepatic necrosis would be unexpected (by virtue of greater 
severity) if the investigator brochure referred only to elevated hepatic enzymes or hepatitis. Similarly, cerebral thromboembolism and c erebral vasculitis would be unexpected (by virtue of 
greater specificity) if the investigator brochure listed only cerebral vascular accidents.  
‘‘Unexpected,’’ as used in this definition, also refers to adverse events or suspected adverse reactions that are mentioned in the Summary of Product Characteristics as occurring with a class of drugs or as anticipated from the pharmacological properties of the drug, but are not specifically mentioned as occurring with the particular drug under investigation.  
8.2.1.6 Independent Safety Monitoring  
The ISM is a physician with relevant expertise in vaccine trials whose primary responsibility will be to provide independent safety monitoring in a timely fashion and to provide recommendations regarding the safe continuation of this study.  
The ISM will evaluate safety data generated from study subjects including all SAEs against the 
known safety profile of the study vaccine to assess for possible changes to the overall risk of the study.   
 ____________________________________________________________________________________________  
53 The ISM will communicate with the PI  as needed to discuss any safety events of special interest 
developing during the study and when conducting the review of the monthly reports of 
cumulative safety data. The study has provisions for a back -up ISM to ensure that independent 
safety monitoring  happens at all times during the study. Additional roles and responsibilities of 
the ISM are described in section 8.2.4 below.  
8.2.2 Collecting and Recording Adverse Events and Pregnancy  
Adverse events may be identified during this study through any of these methods:  
1.  Examination of the subject during study visits.  
2.  Questioning the subject during study visits.  
3.  Receiving a safety report from the subject at any time during the study  
Note: subjects will be asked to call the site if they develop any of the  following:  
• Illness or treatment from a physician or emergency department the entire duration of the study;  
• Diarrhea (≥ 3 unformed stools/24h) for more than 72h with either fever or abdominal pain  
• Any adverse event that limits self -care activities of d aily living (e.g . bathing, dressing and 
undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, taking medications, and not bed ridden) even if he/she decides not to seek medical care;  
• Local REs and/or systemic REs of grade 2 or higher severity after the previous visit (only until 
Day 7 Visit  or at day 35 or 7 days after lymph node sampling ). 
4. Receiving a safety report from subject in Group A if they:  
• Develop any symptoms while on antibiotics  
• Develop any of the following for the duration of the study: 
o diarrhea (≥ 3 unformed stools/24h) for more than 72h with either fever or abdominal pain  
 ____________________________________________________________________________________________  
54 o tinnitus  
o vertigo  
o decrease d hearing  
o numbness/tingling  
A complete recording of safety events in the CRF will include event term,  date(s) of onset and 
resolution/stabilization, assessment of severity, relationship to study vaccine or 
procedures/intervention(s) such as phlebotomy, expectedness, determination of whether the AE 
qualifies as serious or non -serious, treatment required, action taken with study participation, and 
outcome. AEs qualifying as serious also require a narrative of the event. Updates in safety events 
will be recorded as additional information becomes available.  
Information on pregnancies will be collected from the  time a subject signs the consent until the 
subject completes study participation.  Cumulatively monthly reports of safety data will capture any pregnancies and pregnancy outcomes at least on a quarterly basis.  
If a subject becomes pregnant after study entry, the investigator will discuss with the subject and/or the treating physician the known possible risks to the fetus.  
Subjects becoming pregnant after study entry will be withdrawn from the study and followed until the end of the pregnancy.  A pregnancy resulting in congenital anomaly/birth defect will be considered a SAE. Any premature termination of the pregnancy will also be reported and assessed as an SAE as needed.  
8.2.3 Grading and Attribution of Adverse Events  
8.2.3.1 Grading Criteria  
Adverse events will be graded according to the criteria set forth in the National Cancer Institute’s Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Version 4.0 [May 28, 2009;  revise d version 4.03; 
June 14. 2010, http://evs.nci.nih.gov/ftp1/CTCAE/About.html]  
This document (referred to herein as the NCI -CTCAE manual) provides a common language to 
describe levels of severity, to analyze and interpret data, and to articulate the clinical significance of all adverse events.   
 ____________________________________________________________________________________________  
55 All adverse events whether or not listed in the NCI -CTCAE w ill be graded on a scale from 1 to 5 
according to the following standards in the NCI -CTCAE manual (A semi-colon indicates ‘or’ within 
the description of the grade):  
Grade 1 Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; 
intervention not indicated.  
Grade 2 Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age -appropriate 
instrumental ADL*.  
Grade 3 Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; hospitalization or 
prolongation of ho spitalization indicated; disabling; limiting self -care ADL**.  
Grade 4 Life -threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated.  
Grade 5 Death related to AE.  
*Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (ADL) refer to preparing meals, shopping for groceries  or 
clothes, using the telephone, managing money, etc.  
**Self -care Activities of Daily Livin g (ADL)  refer to bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding self, 
using the toilet, taking medications, and not bedridden.  
Not all Grades are appropriate for all AEs; therefore, some AEs are listed with fewer than five options for Grade selection.  
Anaphylaxis is a disorder characterized by an acute inflammatory reaction resulting from the release of histamine and histamine -like substances from mast cells, causing a hypersensitivity 
immune response. Clinically, it presents with breathing difficulty, dizziness, hypotension, cyanosis 
and loss of consciousness and may lead to death.  
Severity grading of anaphylaxis as per the NCI -CTCAE manual is as follows:  
Grade 1= not ap plicable  
Grade 2= not applicable  
 ____________________________________________________________________________________________  
56 Grade 3= Symptomatic bronchospasm, with or without urticaria; parenteral intervention 
indicated; allergy -related edema/angioedema; hypotension  
Grade 4= Life -threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated  
Grade 5= Death   
Severity grading of AEs of laboratory abnormalities will be assessed as per the NCI -CTCAE manual.  
8.2.3.2  Definition of Attribution  
The site investigator will initially determine the relationship of an adverse event to the study 
vaccine or study procedures (blood draw). The investigator’s determination of causality will be 
used for FDA reporting purposes.  
The relationship of an AE to study participation will be determined using definitions in the table 
below:  
Code  Descriptor  Definition (guideline s) 
UNRELATED CATEGORY  
1 Unrelated  The adverse event is clearly not related to study.  The event is completely 
related to an etiology other than the study product or study intervention (the alternative etiology must be documented in the study subject’s medical record)  
2 Unlikely  The adverse event is doubtfully related to study and likely to be related to 
factors other than study product or study intervention.  
RELATED CATEGORIES  
   
3 Possible  The adverse event may be related to study.  There is an association 
between the event and the administration of study product and there is a plausible mechanism for the event to be related to the study product; there may be also an alternative etiology, such as characteristics of the 
subject’s clinical status and/or underlying disease  
 
 ____________________________________________________________________________________________  
57 4 Probable  The adverse event is likely related to study.  There is (1) an association 
between the event and the administration of study product or study 
intervention, (2) a plausible mechanism for the event to be related to the study product, and (3) the event could not be reasonably explained by known characteristics of the subject’s clinical status and  or an alternative etiology is not apparent  
5 Definite  The adverse event is clearly related to study.  There is  (1) an association 
between the event and the administration of the study product or study intervention, (2) a plausible mechanism for the event to be related to the related to the study product, and (3) causes other than the study product 
have been ruled out and/or the event re -appeared on re -exposure to the 
study product  
8.2.4 Reporting Serious Adverse Events to the Independent Safety Monitor  
The Principal Investigator will notify the ISM by email of any SAE within 24 hours of becoming aware 
of the event. The initial SAE CRF should be signed by the PI or designee  and include as much 
information as possible.  
The SAE case report form will be re -submitted and signed by the PI or designee  to the ISM with 
updated relevant medical information as needed until the event is considered closed by the ISM.    
8.2.5 Reporting Serious Adverse Events to the FDA  
N/A. 
8.2.6 Notifying Institutional Review Board  
The Principal  Investigator will ensure the timely dissemination of SAE information, including SAEs 
requiring expedited review by the ISM and to the IRB in accordance with IRB regulations and 
guidelines.  
8.3 Protocol Deviations  
 ____________________________________________________________________________________________  
58 Deviations occur when the Investigator, site study staff, or subjects fail to adhere to protocol 
requirements or when there is non -adherence to GCP as delineated in ICH E6 (R1) guidelines.   
Upon determination that a protocol deviation has occurred, the st udy staff will a) notify the 
Principal Investigator, and b) will complete the Protocol Deviation form. There could be a discussion between the Principal Investigator and the ISM (if needed) to determine the effect of the protocol deviation on the study subject and his/her further study participation, the effect of the protocol deviation on the overall study, and corrective actions.   
The Principal Investigator will complete and sign the Protocol Deviation form and submit it to the 
ISM if needed and to the site IRB, per IRB regulations.   
Identification of protocol deviations will be done through the quality manager at the study site. Reviewing and reporting of minor protocol deviations will be discussed at the Hope Clinic monthly meetings. Major protocol dev iations will be discussed with the PI and the ISM, as indicated .  
 ____________________________________________________________________________________________  
59 9 SAMPLE SIZE CALCULATIONS AND STATISTICAL PLAN  
This is a mechanistic study . Subjects with early termination status are replaced as needed to preserve 
the statistical power needed to substantiate the primary endpoint  
9.1 Sample size and power calculations  
The comparison of antibody  titer s will be based in two ways: direct comparison of antibody titers 
expressed  in international units (IU), and seroprotection rates. Phase 2 and phase 3 subjects will be 
combined in the analysis, resulting in 20 subjects per treatment group.  
For t he comparison of the mean log2 antibody  titers between the two groups, with 2 0 subjects in 
each group, at the alpha level of 0.05, we can reject the null hypothesis of equal means with 80% 
power if the true effect size ((mean0 -mean1)/sigma, assuming equal variance) is 0.91 using an 
unpaired two-sided t -test.  
Based on a previous study of Imovax ®, we expect the probability of  subjects without antibiotics 
treatment reach seroprotection  is close to 1 . Our null hypothesis is the two groups have equal 
proportions of subjects who will reach seroprotection, and the alternative hypothesis is the antibiotic 
treatment lowers the proportion of subjects reaching seroprotection. The sample size of 2 0 subjects 
per treatment group will allow us 80% power to detect a difference in proportions of 0. 31 or higher 
in a one-sided test of two proportions usin g a significance level of 0.05. Data Analysis  
Data from the study will be analyzed u sing the statistical software R .  High -throughput data will be 
analyzed using appropriate methods, either by stand -alone software or modules in leading statistical 
softwares, e.g. the Bioconductor in the R framework. For cytokine data, missing values will be dealt 
with using multiple imputations. For microarray data, nearest neighbor method and local least squares may be used to fill missing values. Unsupervised learning techniques such as PCA, PLSDA, clustering, and factor analysis will be used for the visualization and identification of global patterns. For descriptive endpoints, we will generate summary statistics, and visualize the data using histograms and boxplots when applicable. For the identification of innate signatures, the two treatment groups will be analyzed separately.  
 ____________________________________________________________________________________________  
60 9.1.1 Analyses of Primary Endpoint : Comparison of antibody titers at D28 post 
vaccination in both groups  
Comparison of Antibody  Titers at D28  and D56  Post -Vaccination in Both Groups  
We will take two  alternative routes for data analysis. The first is directly comparing antibody  titers 
between the treatment groups;  and the second is comparing the proportions of subjects achieving 
seroprotection from each group .  
The first data analysis route is directly comparing the means/medians of the antibody  titers between 
the two groups at D28 and D56 . The antibody  titers of each group will be summarized and presented 
using histograms and strip charts for visual comparison. We will use the t -test to compare the 
mean /median  antibody  titers between the two groups. The Wilcoxon test may also be used 
depending on the distribution of th e data.  
In addition, we will compare the two groups based on the proportion of achieving seroprotection. 
For seroprotection, we will dichotomize the outcome into D28 and D56 antibody titer ≥0.5 IU or 
D28, D56 antibody titer <0.5 IU . We will then compare t he two treatment groups by conducting a 
Fisher’s exact test. We will also report the estimated proportion of seroprotection  and its 95% 
confidence interval for each group.  
9.1.2 Analyses of Secondary Endpoint : Frequency, severity, and causality of all adverse 
events in Group A subjects and all adverse events related to sampling of the 
lymph node.  
Descriptive analysis, e.g. tables and histograms, will be conducted to present severity and causality 
of all AEs. The frequency will be tabulated. Comparison between the two treatment groups will be made using Fisher’s exact test on contingency tables.  
Ad hoc analyses of correlations of reactogenicity events with innate and adaptive immune responses may be conducted.  
 
 ____________________________________________________________________________________________  
61 9.1.3 Analysis of Exploratory Endpoints  
Explorato ry Endpoint 1: Analyses of microbiome at D0, D1, D3, D7, D14, D28 , D35, D56, D180, and 
D365 and comparison to baseline screening in both groups  
Sequence results will be analyzed using the open source software package called Quantitative 
Insights  into Microbial Ecology (QIIME) .20 Primary objective of our analyses will be to characterize 
the composition of microbiota samples and to identify specific microbial communities significantly associated with an experimental group.  
Prior to analysis, sequences will undergo quality filtering using QIIME and the sequence quality scores annotated to each raw sequence data. The 16s gene sequences will be aligned and clustered using UCLUST, which is based on a pair -wise identity threshold of 97 %.
21 Clustered sequences will be 
assigned to operational taxonomic units ( OTUs) .22 A single representative sequence for each OTU  will 
be aligned using PyNAST to enable taxonomic classification and generation of phylogenetic trees for subsequent analyses .
20,23,24 
OTUs with taxonomic assignments will allow QIIME to assemble a matrix of OTU abundance in each sample. This matrix will then be used to summarize communities by taxonomic composition and 
abundance, which can be visualized together as area/bar graphs or hea tmaps. Information from 
phylogenetic trees will be used to compute distances or levels of dissimilarity between microbial 
communities using Unifrac .
25 This tool will enable compositional comparisons between samples 
(beta diversity) to be conducted. For thi s purpose, we will use the OTU matrix to calculate distance 
or dissimilarity of samples between experimental groups using weighted and unweighted UniFrac metrics. Q IIME will then generate 2 and 3 -dimensional Principal Coordinate Analysis plots to 
represent  the distance matrix data. Furthermore, QIIME codes a tool based on G test of 
Independence to identify OTUs that are differentially represented across experimental groups. This tool will also be conducted and applied to the beta diversity Principal Coordin ate Analyses to help 
explain which OTUs are significantly associated with a particular experimental group.  
For longitudinal analyses of samples within each group, semivariogram plots will be generated using dissimilarity metrics over time (Euclidean) plott ed against community dissimilarity (UniFrac) .
20,26 
 ____________________________________________________________________________________________  
62 Exploratory endpoint 2: Analysis of the repertoire and monoclonal antibodies from plasmablasts in 
a subset of vaccinees at D7 and D35 in both groups  
The repertoire and monoclonal antibody levels will be presented as descriptions of the actual values. 
Summary statistics, boxplots and histograms will be used to summarize the data.  
Exploratory endpoint 3: Identification of innate immune signatures (traditional immune parameters 
measurements + array -based gene expression) at D1, D3 and D7 in both groups  
We will take the measurements on the day of vaccination as baseline. For traditional immune 
parameters, we will test if an immune parameter shows significant change over baseline at day 1, 3, 
and 7 after each vac cination, using a two -sided paired t -test. Fold -change (ratio between the mean 
values of the two groups) will be combined with the test p -value in a selection criterion as 
appropriate. Based on previous studies similar in nature, the tentative selection cr iterion is p -value 
≤ 0.01 and fold change ≥ 3.  
For the gene expression data, we will use the method Significance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM) with paired design to find differentially expressed genes .
27 False discovery rate (FDR) will be used as 
selectio n criterion . The tentative selection criterion is FDR ≤ 0.1. 
Exploratory endpoint 4: Correlation of innate immune signatures at days D1, D3 and D7 with antibod y 
titers at D28 and D56 in both groups  
For traditional immune parameters, we will calculate the c orrelation coefficient between the 
immune parameter and the adaptive immune response ( antibody  titers at D28  and D56) . The p -
values associated with the correlation coefficients will be used to select traditional immune parameters that are associated with the respective adaptive immune responses. The tentative 
selection criterion is p -value ≤ 0.01.  
For gene expression data,  we will use the method Significance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM) with 
quantitative outcome to identify genes that are significantly associated with the respective adaptive 
immune responses ( antibody titers at D28  and D56 ). False discovery rate (FDR) will  be used as 
selection criterion. The tentative selection criterion is FDR ≤ 0.1. 
 ____________________________________________________________________________________________  
63 Exploratory endpoint 5: Description of immune profiling in the blood and the lymph node at different 
time point s   
Data will be presented as descriptions of the actual values.  Summary statistics, boxplots and 
histograms will be used to summarize the data.  
9.1.4 Patient Populations  
We will use all subjects who are randomized, receive the vaccine, complete at least one day of 
antibiotic treatment, and have measurements at days 0 and 2 8 in the data analysis.  
9.1.5 Study Subject Baseline Characteristics and Demographics  
A summary of descriptive statistics for baseline and demographic characteristics will be provided for all enrolled subjects. Demographic data will include age, race, sex, and m edical history, including 
current medication use and vaccination history.  
9.2 Interim Analyses  
Interim analysis will be conducted  after each phase .   
9.3 Deviations from Statistical Plan  
The principal features of the study design and of the plan for statistical an alysis of the data are 
outlined in this protocol. Any changes in these principal features will require a protocol amendment and will be  described in the final report.  
Although our statistical methods and time -points for measurements will adhere to what is proposed 
herein, for the explorative endpoints, our experience with analyses of similar studies in the past has 
underscored the need for flexibility and adaptability in trying different statistical approaches to arrive at the most informative results, especially for the high- throughput data.  
As such, we may use alternative approaches such as the gene set enrichment analyses, or other approaches, and run additional statistical analyses of data generated by use of assays at time points 
other than those state d in the primary, secondary and exploratory endpoints, on an ad hoc basis .

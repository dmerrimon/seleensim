Statistical methods The primary analysis is performed using MCPMod, a methodology for dose 
finding employing both multiple comparison procedures and modelling 
techniques. The MCPMod procedure allows for simultaneous evaluation of different potential dose response patterns, while protecting the overall false positive rate (probability of Type I error) using a one-sided, nominal α level of 
10%. As a basis for the MCPMod analysis, a mixed model for repeated measure (MMRM) analysis will be used to generate covariate adjusted estimates of mean 
change from baseline to Week 10 in ZAN-BPD total score and associated 
covariance matrices.

001-MCS-40-106 RD-03 (18 0) / Saved on: 10 Jul 20191. INTRODUCTION
1.1 MEDICAL BACKGROUND
Borderline personality disorder (BoPD) is a chronic mental disorder with an estimated 
prevalence of around 2% in the general community and severe impairment on quality of life 
(R16-5474 ). Patients with BoPD often have psychiatric comorbidities; concomitant mood, 
anxiety, substance use, and eating disorders have been reported at high rates ( R19-1118 ). The 
main symptom clusters of BoPD include impulsive-behavioral dyscontrol, cognitive-
perceptual symptoms, disturbed interpersonal relations, and affective instability. Affective symptoms and impulsivity have been considered core symptoms of BoPD. Patients typically experience intense fears of real or imagined abandonment, which may result in inappropriate anger even when faced with a realistic short-term separation or when there are unavoidable changes in plans ( R19-1313 ). Even the presence of a single diagnostic feature of BoPD is 
predictive for poor functioning and psychiatric illness burden ( R16-5483 ). Patients with 
BoPD have high rates of deliberate self-harm and a rate of completed suicide that is 50 times 
that in the general population ( R16-5477 ). 
Treatment guidelines recommend psychotherapy as the mainstay of treatment for BoPD 
(R17-0164 ). Particularly dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) has proven to be effective in 
BoPD. A disadvantage of DBT in clinical practice is that it is costly, time intensive, and 
requiring specialized clinical providers, making access for all patients in need of therapy difficult ( R19-1550 ). While generalist models of care have shown potential, not all patients 
respond to them and patients with greater personality dysfunction still require intensive 
specialist treatment ( R19-1092 ).
Pharmacotherapy is commonly used as an off-label adjunctive, symptom-targeted component 
of treatment. This includes treatment of affective dysregulation symptoms such as depressive symptoms (with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), mood stabilizers or related drugs), impulsive-behavioral dyscontrol symptoms such as impulsivity, aggression, self-destructive behavior (initially also with SSRI), and cognitive-perceptual symptoms such as paranoid thinking (with low-dose neuroleptics, (R17-0164). However, no drug is approved for the treatment of BoPD, and no standard-of-care pharmacological treatment of the disease exists.
The last large clinical studies exploring pharmacologic treatment for BoPD were conducted
about a decade ago.  The lamotrigine study assessing clinical effectiveness and cost effectiveness of lamotrigine vs. placebo in patients with BoPD ( R19-1645 ) included 276 
participants, of whom 195 were followed up 52 weeks later. Efficacy assessments using the 
Zanarini rating scale for Borderline personality disorder (ZAN-BPD) were performed at Weeks 12, 24 and 52. The primary efficacy outcome was the ZAN-BPD total score at Week 52. While the study failed to meet its primary efficacy outcome, the ZAN-BPD total score decreased from baseline to Week 12 and remained rather stable thereafter (R19-1645). 
Similarly, the olanzapine vs. placebo study was a 12-week randomized, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled study in 451 patients with BoPD. In this study, statistically significant separation of olanzapine from placebo on ZAN-BPD was observed at Weeks 2, 4, 6, 8 and

001-MCS-40-106 RD-03 (18 0) / Saved on: 10 Jul 201910, while the result at Week 12 was not statistically significant and thus the study failed to meet its primary efficacy outcome at 12 weeks ( R19-1108 ).
Despite the efforts in the therapy of BoPD, a sizeable portion of patients (about 40%) never 
achieve recovery from the disorder. In addition to their severely impacted quality of life, those patients have a poor prognosis for other important outcomes, such as vocational impairment, disability, physical morbidity, and mortality ( R19-1119 ). As current 
pharmacological treatments are symptomatic and not supported by robust clinical evidence, a 
great unmet medical need remains for agents improving core characteristics of the disorder such as affective symptoms and emotion control.
In absence of any approved drug therapy and limitations related to availability and 
accessibility of psychotherapy for most BoPD patients, there is great unmet medical need to address and BI 1358894 would represent major therapeutic advance.

The study will be monitored by an external Data Monitoring Committee (DMC), independent 
from the sponsor; refer to section 8.7for further DMC details.  
For the Phase II trial, the benefit-risk for trial patients treated with BI 1358894 remains
unchanged in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic given that:
∀The mode of action does not appear to have a substantial effect on clinically relevant 
organs (e.g. respiratory or cardiovascular system) critically affected by COVID-19
∀There is currently no evidence that intake of BI 1358894 leads to immunosuppression
∀There is currently no evidence that BoPD increases the risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection or
for developing severe COVID-19
∀The BoPD patients are relatively young patients (30-50 years) and, in general, without 
common co-morbidities associated with severe course of COVID-19
Therefore, the risk for patients participating in the study will not differ from the current 
general risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection with all its potential consequences. The use of a specific SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) as a tool for inclusion or exclusion of trial participants during the screening phase is not foreseen, since it is not believed that study drug raises the risk for the patient to develop COVID-19. It is also not believed that a SARS-CoV-2 infection or clinically apparent COVID-19 impacts the activity of the investigational or comparator compound.
Every patient will be assessed thoroughly, and individual benefit-risk assessments will be
made prior to study entrance and during the study by the investigator in respect of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The investigators will take the totality of information related to each patient and the local COVID-19 situation into consideration when performing the individual benefit-risk assessment. Considering all aspects, the investigator will decide upon each patient’s inclusion and continued participation in the trial. BI as the sponsor, where required, will support the investigator in their decision finding. It is acknowledged that the investigator may decide to implement protocol deviations where this protects the safety, wellbeing and/or is in the best interest of the patient and the site environment.
For details on treatment related risks, refer to protocol section 1.2and the IB.

relationship and assess the treatment effect size.
The study will be performed to characterize the dose-response curve for BI 1358894 in 
patients with BoPD by assessing four BI 1358894 doses and placebo. The response is the change from baseline in ZAN-BPD at Week 10 summarized per arm by the adjusted mean.  The multiple comparison procedure with modelling (MCPMod) approach will be used for the characterization of the dose-response curve.
The primary characterization will be on treatment which will assume all patients took 
randomized treatment for the duration of the study. See section 3.2for justification of
assessing endpoints at Week 10. 
Assessments of secondary and further endpoints will also be performed to help support 
selection of a dose (range) and assess the treatment effect size.

001-MCS-40-106 RD-03 (18 0) / Saved on: 10 Jul 20193. DESCRIPTION OF DESIGN AND TRIAL POPULATION
3.1 OVERALL TRIAL DESIGN 
This is a Phase II, 12-week multi-center, multi-national, randomized, double-blind, placebo-
controlled parallel-group trial in patients with BoPD. A targeted total of 355 patients with 
BoPD meeting the entry criteria are planned to be randomized into this trial. 
V = Visit, W = Week, FUP = Follow-up, EoT = End of treatment, EoTrial = End of trial
= Telephone visit
Figure 3.1: 1 Study design
Patients will be enrolled into the trial once consent has been signed. Patients suitable after 
screening will be randomized to the 12-week double-blind treatment period at Visit 2 and will be assigned to placebo or one of the four treatment groups in 2.5:1:1:1:2 ratio (Figure 3.1: 1).
After the completion of the 12-week double-blind treatment period or following early 
discontinuation of trial medication at any point, patients will complete the 4-week follow-up period.  Individual patient participation is concluded when the patient has completed their last planned visit (End of Trial visit). Safety will be formally evaluated at each visit until the end of the observational period which is 28 days after the end of treatment or for a longer time in case of unresolved AEs.

001-MCS-40-106 RD-03 (18 0) / Saved on: 10 Jul 20193.2 DISCUSSION OF TRIAL DESIGN, INCLUDING THE CHOICE OF 
CONTROL GROUP(S)
This is a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-design study. This design is 
appropriate for providing proof-of-concept and dose-ranging and assessing the safety and efficacy of BI 1358894 compared to placebo in patients with BoPD. It is important to have a placebo control to address potential confounding factors.
The design of the study will provide efficacy, safety and dosing information to support PoC. 
In order to achieve both aims in an efficient way the generalized MCPMod approach has been implemented as the statistical design. This approach is widely accepted ( R15-1961 , 
R19-1647 ) and is able to incorporate potential relationships between the different doses into 
the evaluations via optimal test contrasts and uses the available data better than the 
commonly applied pairwise comparisons. 
A total of four BI 1358894 doses were chosen to provide reasonable coverage for most
monotonic shapes. A sufficiently broad set of candidate shapes for the dose-response relationship has also been chosen. In addition, an unequal allocation ratio (2.5:1:1:1:2, PBO:5mg:25mg:75mg:125mg) has been selected for the treatment and placebo groups. An unequal allocation ratio will lead to better precision of the dose response modelling. In addition, increasing the proportion of patients in the placebo group compared to other treatment arms may lead to the observation of a greater separation between the placebo and active treatment arms ( P09-01434 ). Details of the statistical approach including the set of 
candidate models as well as a sample size justification are given in section 7.
Efforts to avoid real or imagined abandonment is one of the core and most prominent 
symptoms of BoPD. Patients with BoPD experience intense fears of abandonment, which may result in inappropriate anger even when faced with a realistic short-term separation or when there are unavoidable changes in plans ( R19-1313 ). This phenomenon has not been 
understood adequately in context of a large controlled clinical trial setting; however, the 
observation of loss of effect towards the end of a large global clinical study can be hypothetically explained on the basis of fear of abandonment ( R19-1108 ). Anecdotally, 
clinicians are sensitive to issue of perceived abandonment towards the end or change of a 
therapeutic relationship with a patient with BoPD. 
Although this study is a 12-week treatment duration, we plan to evaluate the primary 
endpoint change in ZAN-BPD total score at Week 10, to avoid any potential issues related to perceived abandonment at the end of treatment period as explained above. 
All efficacy will be collected and assessed until Week 12, i.e. until the end of treatment. In 
addition, safety measures will be collected until end of trial. Collectively, this information will help facilitate the design of the Phase III program.

001-MCS-40-106 RD-03 (18 0) / Saved on: 10 Jul 20193.3 SELECTION OF TRIAL POPULATION
The total of 355 patients are planned to be randomized into the study. It is planned that 
approximately 70 trial centers will be participating in this trial to ensure sufficient number of patients are randomized. 
It is expected that approximately 5-10 patients will be randomized at each trial center.  If 
enrollment is delayed, additional sites may be recruited. To avoid differential center influence on study results, permission to randomize more than 15 patients per site must be obtained from the sponsor. This will only be allowed after a careful review of the enrollment status and of the site.
Screening of patients for this trial is competitive, i.e., screening for the trial will stop at all 
centers when such a number of patients has been screened that it is anticipated that a sufficient number of patients will be randomized to trial treatment. Investigators will be notified when the screening is complete and will not be allowed to recruit additional patients for this trial. Patients who have completed Visit 1 procedures prior to notification of the termination of recruitment will be allowed to continue in the trial, if they meet all entry criteria and they are able to follow the visit schedule specified in the protocol.
A log of all patients enrolled into the trial (i.e. who have signed informed consent) will be 
maintained in the Investigator Site File (ISF) irrespective of whether they have been treated with investigational drug or not. If a patient is enrolled in error (does not meet all inclusion criteria or meets one or more exclusion criteria on the day of enrolment), the sponsor should be contacted immediately.
3.3.1 Main diagnosis for trial entry
Patients meeting diagnostic criteria of BoPD per Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental 
Disorders (DSM-5) and diagnosis confirmed at time of screening by Structured Interview for DSM-5 Personality Disorder (SCID-5-PD) will be screened for suitability for the study.
Please refer to section 8.3.1 for the documentation requirements pertaining to the in- and 
exclusion criteria.
3.3.2 Inclusion criteria
1. Patients meeting diagnostic criteria of BoPD per DSM-5 at screening visit, confirmed by 
SCID-5-PD.
2. ZAN-BPD of ≥ 9 at screening (Visit 1) and randomization (Visit 2), with question #2

3.3.4 Withdrawal of patients from treatment or assessments
Patients may discontinue trial treatment or withdraw consent to trial participation as a whole
(“withdrawal of consent”) with very different implications; please see sections 3.3.4.1 and 3.3.4.2 below.
After premature study drug discontinuation, patients will be asked to further attend scheduled
trial visits unless they withdraw consent to participate in the study. If it is not possible toattend all visits, at least phone contacts will occur at the scheduled visit time points (section6.2.3 ). It is vital to explain to patients the importance of continuing trial participation and the
value of collecting data for all randomized patients. Measures to control the withdrawal rate 
include careful patient selection, appropriate explanation of the trial requirements and procedures prior to trial enrolment, as well as the explanation of the consequences of withdrawal. See section 6.2.3 for procedures handling early discontinuation and patient 
follow-up.
The decision to discontinue trial treatment or withdraw consent to trial participation, together 
with the reason, must be documented in the patient files and case report form (CRF). If applicable, consider the requirements for Adverse Event collection reporting (please see sections 5.2.6.2.1 and 5.2.6.2 ).
3.3.4.1 Discontinuation of trial treatment
An individual patient will discontinue trial treatment if:
∀The patient wants to discontinue trial treatment, without the need to justify the decision.
∀The patient has repeatedly shown to be non-compliant with trial procedures and, in the 
opinion of both, the investigator and sponsor representative, is not willing or able to adhere to the trial requirements in the future. 
∀The patient can no longer receive trial treatment for medical reasons (such as surgery, 
AE, or other diseases), per investigator’s clinical judgement.

001-MCS-40-106 RD-03 (18 0) / Saved on: 10 Jul 2019∀The patient shows disease progression/worsening that precludes further participation in 
the trial per investigator’s clinical judgement.
∀The participant develops suicidal ideation of type 4 or 5 in the C-SSRS (i.e., active 
suicidal thought with intent but without specific plan, active suicidal thought with plan 
and intent) or suicidal behavior (i.e. actual attempt, interrupted attempt, aborted attemptor preparatory acts or behavior).
∀Any Non-suicidal self-injury that impacts safety of the study participant and jeopardize 
continued participation in the trial as per the clinical judgement of investigator.
∀Pregnancy occurs during the trial.
If new efficacy/safety information becomes available, Boehringer Ingelheim will review the
benefit-risk-assessment and, if needed, pause or discontinue the trial treatment for all patients or take any other appropriate action to guarantee the safety of the trial patients. 
Even if the trial treatment is discontinued, the patients should remain in the trial and, given 
their agreement, will undergo the procedures for early treatment discontinuation and follow-up as outlined in the Flow Chart and section 6.2.3 .
3.3.4.2 Withdrawal of consent to trial participation
Patients may withdraw their consent to trial participation at any time without the need to 
justify the decision.
If a patient wants to withdraw consent, the investigator should be involved in the discussion 
with the patient and explain the difference between trial treatment discontinuation and withdrawal of consent to trial participation, as well as explain the options for continued follow-up after trial treatment discontinuation, please see section 3.3.4.1 above.
3.3.4.3 Discontinuation of the trial by the sponsor
Boehringer Ingelheim reserves the right to discontinue the trial overall or at a particular trial
site at any time for the following reasons:1. Failure to meet expected enrolment goals overall or at a particular trial site.2. New efficacy or safety information invalidating the earlier positive benefit-risk-
assessment, please see section 3.3.4.1.
Deviations from GCP, the trial protocol, or the contract impairing the appropriate conduct 
of the trial.
An unexpected and unusually high dropout rate.
Further follow up of patients affected will occur as described in section 3.3.4.1 and 6.2.2.
The investigator / the trial site will be reimbursed for reasonable expenses incurred in case of 
trial termination (except in case of the third reason).

001-MCS-40-106 RD-03 (18 0) / Saved on: 10 Jul 20194.1.3 Method of assigning patients to treatment groups
After the assessment of all inclusion and exclusion criteria, each eligible patient will be 
randomized to treatment groups according to a randomization plan at Visit 2 via Interactive Response Technology (IRT). Note that the medication number is different from the patient number. Instructions for the use of IRT are provided in the ISF.
Patients will be randomly assigned by IRT, in a 2.5:1:1:1:2 ratio to one of these treatment 
groups: 
1. Placebo 2. BI 1358894 5 mg qd3. BI 1358894 25 mg qd4. BI 1358894 75 mg qd5. BI 1358894 125 mg qd
Patient assignment to the treatment groups will be determined by a computer-generated 
random sequence. Randomization sequence will be generated using validated randomizationsoftware. Access to the randomization code will be controlled and documented.
Randomization will be stratified by baseline ZAN-BPD total score ( ≤18 vs.≥19).
4.1.4 Drug assignment and administration of doses for each patient
The medication assignment will be provided through IRT. The assigned medication numbers 
must be entered in the eCRF, and the corresponding medication kits must be given to the patient. 
At Visit 2, after randomization, patients will receive their first medication kit. The first dose 
of trial medication will be taken at the study site under supervision of the investigator or site staff. At each dispensing visit (Visits 2, 5, and 7), patients will receive one medication kit containing supplies for a total of 35 treatment days (28 treatment days plus 7 days reserve).Return of the used/unused medication kits will occur at Visit 5, 7 and EoT/eEoT.
Patients should be instructed not to take their trial medication in the morning of Visits 3, 4, 5, 
6, 7 and 8, as patients will be dosed at the site after pre-dose PK sampling. Patients should also be instructed not to take their trial medication in the morning of EoT visit, as a trough PK sample will be taken at that visit (approximately 24 hours after the last dose). For patients that complete the treatment period, the last dose of trial medication should be taken on the

Each dose will consist of 4 tablets (Table 4.1.5.1: 1). Patients should be instructed to take the
study medication orally with water and with or without food, every morning at approximately the same time. It is recommended that patients continue to take study medication in a consistent way, i.e. either with or without food. If a morning dose is missed by more than 12 hours, that dose should be skipped and the next dose should be taken as scheduled. On days prior to a visit, the morning dose should be taken approximately 24 hours before the planned dose at the visit.
During the COVID-19 pandemic, there may be instances that will prevent a patient from 
going to the site for a study visit. If the investigator concludes that it is acceptable and safe for the patient to continue trial medication, it is permissible for the trial medication to be shipped from the site to the patient (for more details see section 6.2and 10.3).
4.1.5 Blinding and procedures for unblinding
4.1.5.1 Blinding
Study medications will be administered double-blinded. In order to maintain blinding in 
regard to each treatment, each dose will contain 4 tablets in a double-dummy design, as shown in Table 4.1.5.1: 1. Double-dummy design is required since BI 1358894 tablets (5 mg, 25 mg, 50 mg) are different sizes. Placebo tablets are identical in size and appearance to the corresponding active tablet and are combined with active tablets as needed in each dose group to maintain the blinding.

Patients, investigators, central reviewers, and everyone involved in trial conduct or analysis 
or with any other interest in this double-blind trial will remain blinded with regard to the randomized treatment assignments until after database lock, with the exceptions described in this section below.
The access to the randomization code will be kept restricted until its release for analysis.The randomization codes will be provided to bioanalytics prior to last patient completed to 
allow for the exclusion from the analyses of PK samples taken from placebo patients.

001-MCS-40-106 RD-03 (18 0) / Saved on: 10 Jul 2019Bioanalytics will not disclose the randomization code or the results of their measurements until the trial is officially unblinded.
Dedicated database snapshots (no partial database lock (DBL)) will be generated prior to 
DBL to allow for development and refinement of population PK and exposure-response models (“Fast-track” PK/PD analysis). The exact time points for the data cut-offs will be aligned with general project planning. Details of this analysis will be defined in the PK/PD analysis plan. Only personnel involved in the population PK and exposure-response analyses will be granted access to the unblinded data before DBL, whereas the trial team and all otherfunctions not involved in the population PK and exposure-response analyses will remain blinded. The analysis plan for the population PK and exposure-response analyses will be finalized and signed prior to this database snapshot for ‘fast-track’ PK/PD analyses.
No formal interim report will be generated. Final PK and PK/PD analyses will be reported 
separately from the clinical trial report (CTR) after availability of data from DBL.
4.1.5.2 Unblinding and breaking the codeEmergency unblinding will be available to the investigator via IRT. It must only be used in
an emergency situation when the identity of the trial drug must be known to the investigatorin order to provide appropriate medical treatment or otherwise assure safety of trialparticipants. The reason for unblinding must be documented in the source documents and/or appropriate CRF page.
Due to the requirements to report Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions 
(SUSARs), it may be necessary for a representative from BI’s Pharmacovigilance group to access the randomization code for individual patients during trial conduct. The access to the code will only be given to authorized Pharmacovigilance representatives for processing in the PV database system and not be shared further. 
4.1.6 Packaging, labelling, and re-supply
The investigational medicinal products will be provided by BI. They will be packaged and 
labelled in accordance with the principles of Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP).
Initial study drug supplies will be sent to the site after the first patient is screened at the site.  
Re-supply to the sites will be managed via an IRT system, which will also monitor expiry dates of supplies available at the sites.
For details of packaging and the description of the label, refer to the ISF.
4.1.7 Storage conditions
Drug supplies must be kept in their original packaging and in a secure limited access storage 
area according to the recommended storage conditions on the medication label. Atemperature log must be maintained for documentation.

4.1.8 Drug accountability
The investigator or designee will receive the investigational drugs delivered by the sponsor
when the following requirements are fulfilled:
∀Approval of the clinical trial protocol by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) / 
Independent Ethics Committee (IEC),
∀Availability of a signed and dated clinical trial contract between the sponsor and the

001-MCS-40-106 RD-03 (18 0) / Saved on: 10 Jul 20194.2.2.3 Contraception requirements
Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP - for the definition please refer to section 3.3.2 ) 
must use two methods of contraception, which include one highly effective method of birth 
control per ICH M3 (R2) that result in a low failure rate of less than 1%, plus one barrier 
method. Contraception must be used during the treatment and follow-up period. 
Counseling about the importance of having birth control measures in place will be performed 
at study entry visit (during consenting process), informing women about the risk of medication-induced births defects when exposed to potentially teratogenic medication. Investigator must ensure that the patient understands the contraception requirements for the study and must confirm that the patient can reliably comply with contraception use during the study. Patients not expected to comply with contraception requirements should not be included in the study.
The importance of continuing with their chosen forms of birth control during study conduct 
will be emphasized to mitigate this risk and it must be reiterated at all visits as per Flow Chart
(including phone visits). This must include confirmation from the patient that she is using 
required contraception consistently and appropriately. If contraceptive protection cannot be confirmed, as judged by the investigator, the patient must be discontinued from the study drug. Study drug can be restarted only when contraception is used again, and sufficient protection is reached. Counseling and contraception confirmation must be recorded in CRFs.
Acceptable forms of contraception are:
One of the following highly effective methods of birth control per ICH M3 (R2) that result in a low failure rate of less than 1%:
∀Use of hormonal methods of contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation
a. combined (estrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception:
•o r a l• intravaginal• transdermal
b. progestogen-only hormonal contraception:
•o r a l• injectable• Implantable
∀Placement of intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine hormone releasing system 
(IUS)
∀Bilateral tubal occlusion or ligation
∀Vasectomy (with appropriate post-vasectomy documentation of the absence of sperm 
in the ejaculate and provided that male partner is the sole sexual partner of the WOCBP trial participant).
∀Complete sexual abstinence when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle 
of the patient (note: periodic abstinence such as calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception) - (in this specific case the barrier methods, as mentioned below, are not applicable).Sexual abstinence as a contraceptive method will not be allowed for WOCBP who are heterosexually active.

The current status of BoPD will be assessed during the course of the trial by using the ZAN-BPD (Zanarini rating scale for Borderline personality disorder) as the primary scores and, fora wider perspective, with the outcomes of th e DERS-16, STAI-S, PHQ-9, S-UPPS-P, CGI-S, 
PGI-S, EQ-5D-5L, and SDS scores. EcMA outcomes will be utilized as an additional source 
of information in an exploratory manner to examine its potential use in future trials.
5.1 ASSESSMENT OF EFFICACY
Zanarini rating scale for Borderline personality disorder (ZAN-BPD)
The ZAN-BPD scale has been widely used in borderline personality research in both 
academic and clinical research settings. The psychometric properties of the ZAN-BPD have been evaluated, and the results indicate that it is a sensitive scale for assessing changes in BoPD over time ( R15-1332 ). The ZAN-BPD scale is based on the borderline module of the 
Diagnostic Interview for DSM-4 Personality Disorder (DIPD-4). Considering that there has 
been no change in the core diagnostic criteria for BoPD from DSM-4 to DSM-5, the ZAN-BPD scale remains relevant as a clinical outcome measure for BoPD. 
The ZAN-BPD scale reflects the nine DSM-5 disease criteria and intrinsically aims to cover 
the entire symptomology of BoPD. The ZAN-BPD scale includes a 5-point rating scale (i.e., 0 = No Symptoms to 4 = Severe Symptoms) for each criterion and measures frequency and severity of BoPD over time with a 1-week recall period. In addition, the scale has 4 sector scores that reveal reflect core areas of BoPD (i.e., affective, cognitive, impulsive and interpersonal symptoms). The total ZAN-BPD score is the sum of these 4 sector scores and ranges from 0 to 36. 
The ZAN-BPD scale will be administered as an interview in this study. This assessment 
should take approximately 25-30 minutes. The ZAN-BPD will be captured using the rater station/tablet provided by the vendor.
Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale – 16 item (DERS-16) 
The DERS is a widely-used, theoretically driven, and psychometrically sound self-report 
measure of emotion regulation difficulties ( R19-1172 ,R19-1186 ). While the DERS was 
originally developed as a 36-item self-report  measure, the brief, 16-item version (DERS-16), 
was developed to reduce patient burden (e.g. in larger studies and clinical trials that requiredrepeated assessments) ( R19-1171 ). 
The DERS-16 is to be completed by the patient using the rater station/tablet provided by the 
vendor and should take about 5-8 minutes to complete. It consists of 16 items that assess the following dimensions of emotion regulation difficulties: non-acceptance of negative emotions (three items), inability to engage in goal-directed behaviors when distressed (three items), difficulties controlling impulsive behaviors when distressed (three items), limited access to emotion regulation strategies perceived as effective (five items), and lack of emotional clarity (two items). Respondents rate the extent to which each item applies to them on a 5-point Likert-type scale, where 1 is “almost never (0-10%),” 2 is “sometimes (11-35%),” 3 is “about half the time (36-65%),” 4 is “most of the time (66-90%),” and 5 is “almost always (91-

001-MCS-40-106 RD-03 (18 0) / Saved on: 10 Jul 2019100%).” Total scores on the DERS-16 can range from 16 to 80, with higher scores reflecting greater levels of emotion dysregulation.
The DERS-16 is completed by the patient, and should take approximately 5-8 minutes to 
complete. The DERS-16 will be captured using the rater station/tablet provided by the vendor.
State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI)
The STAI has been used extensively in research and clinical practice ( R98-0762 ). It is
comprised of separate self-report scales for measuring state and trait anxiety. For this study, 
only the state anxiety questions (STAI-S) will be used.
The STAI-S (STAI Form Y-1) consists of 20 item statements that evaluate how respondents 
feel “right now, at this moment.” All items are rated on a weighted score of 1 to 4 scale (e.g. from ‘Almost Never to ‘Almost Always’); with higher scores indicating greater anxiety.  
The STAI-S is to be completed by the patient and should take approximately 10-12 minutes 
to complete. The STAI-S will be captured using the rater station/tablet provided by the vendor.
Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) 
The PHQ-9 is a 9-item brief self-reported tool used for screening, diagnosing, monitoring and 
measuring the severity of depression ( R12-3115 ). The PHQ-9 asks patient ‘ Over the last 
two weeks, how often have you been bothered by any of the following problems?’ in 
nine questions, with a maximum total score of 27. Depression Severity is assessed as: none (0-4), mild (5-9), moderate (10-14), moderately severe (15-19), or severe (20-27).
The PHQ-9 is to be completed by the patient and should take approximately 5 minutes to 
complete. The PHQ-9 will be captured using the rater station/tablet provided by the vendor.

ECG vendor. The ECGs will be recorded for at least 10-second duration after the subjects have rested for at least 5 minutes in a supine position and prior to lab sampling. Electrode placement will be performed according to the method of Einthoven/Goldberger (ankles and wrists). At time points indicated in the Flow Chart, single ECGs will be recorded. ECG recordings at planned time points may be repeated for quality reasons like alternating current artefacts, muscle movements and electrode dislocation. In this case the repeated ECG recordings will be used if quality was better.

001-MCS-40-106 RD-03 (18 0) / Saved on: 10 Jul 2019The investigator or a designee will evaluate whether the ECG is normal or abnormal and whether it is clinically significant, if abnormal. The electronic version of the ECG is regarded as source data. Dated and signed printouts will be stored in the patient’s medical file if there is no validated and certified e-medical record for ECG data.
Additional ECGs may be collected by the investigator for safety reasons. Clinically relevant 
findings noticed at Visit 1 should be reported as baseline conditions. Clinically relevant,abnormal findings noticed after Visit 1 should be reported as AEs and followed up and/or treated locally until the condition returns to normal or becomes stable condition.
All ECGs will be transmitted electronically to the central ECG vendor in order to enable a 
centralized and independent re-evaluation of all 12-lead ECGs. A centralized and independent re-evaluation will be done.
Central evaluation on an individual ECG level will be performed by the vendor and a report 
will be provided to the site. Decisions on eligibility for the trial and treatment or further follow-up of any findings are in the responsibility of the investigator.
5.2.5 Other safety parameters
5.2.5.1 Assessment of suicidality
Suicidal risk will be assessed by the C-SSRS. The C-SSRS is a semi-structured, investigator-
rated interview, developed by clinical experts in cooperation with the FDA, assessing both suicidal behavior and suicidal ideation. It does not give a global score, but provides some categorical and some severity information specifically for behavior and ideation. The C-SSRS is completed by the interviewer and is captured using the rater station/tablet provided by the vendor.
The C-SSRS has been widely used in large multi-national clinical trials. The C-SSRS will be 
administered first at screening (Visit 1) (using the ‘Baseline / Screening’ version) with the aim to exclude subjects with active moderate or severe symptomatology within a specified time prior to screening. 
After screening (Visit 1) the assessment ‘since last visit’ will be performed at each clinic visit 
(‘Since Last Visit version’). The investigator is to review/consider the C-SSRS results for plausibility and clinical relevance. If the positive report is confirmed, appropriate actions for the subject’s safety have to be initiated.
All C-SSRS reports of suicidal ideation type 4 or 5 and all reports of suicidal behavior must 
be reported as separate SAEs by the investigator.
For ‘Self-injurious behavior, no suicidal intent’ standard AE / SAE reporting rules are to be 
applied.
For each C-SSRS report of suicidal ideation type 1, 2 or 3 after start of the trial, the 
investigator is to decide based on clinical judgment whether it represents an AE as defined in the protocol, and if it is considered an AE then it must be reported accordingly. Please note,

5.2.6 Assessment of adverse events
5.2.6.1 Definitions of AEs 
5.2.6.1.1 Adverse eventAn AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation 
subject administered a medicinal product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment.
An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product.
The following should also be recorded as an AE in the CRF and BI SAE form (if applicable):
∀Worsening of the underlying disease or of other pre-existing conditions 
∀Changes in vital signs, ECG, physical examination and laboratory test results, if they 
are judged clinically relevant by the investigator.
If such abnormalities already exist prior to trial inclusion, they will be considered as baseline 
conditions and should be collected in the eCRF only.
Regarding AEs in the context of suicidal risk assessment by C-SSRS, section 5.2.5.1 should be 
adhered.
5.2.6.1.2 Serious adverse event
A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as any AE, which fulfils at least one of the 
following criteria:
- results in death,- is life-threatening, which refers to an event in which the patient was at risk of death at 
the time of the event; it does not refer to an event that hypothetically might have caused death if more severe,
- requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization- results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity,- is a congenital anomaly / birth defect,- is deemed serious for any other reason if it is an important medical event when based 
on appropriate medical judgement which may jeopardize the patient and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the above definitions. Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization or development of dependency or abuse.

001-MCS-40-106 RD-03 (18 0) / Saved on: 10 Jul 2019For Japan only: the following events will be handled as “deemed serious for any other reason”. AEs which possibly lead to disability will be reported as SAEs.
5.2.6.1.3 AEs considered “Always Serious”In accordance with the European Medicines Agency initiative on Important Medical Events, 
Boehringer Ingelheim has set up a list of AEs, which by their nature, can always be considered to be “serious” even though they may not have met the criteria of an SAE as defined above.
The latest list of “Always Serious AEs” can be found in the EDC system. A copy of the latest 
list of “Always Serious AEs” will be provided upon request. These events should always be reported as SAEs as described in section 5.2.6.2.
Cancers of new histology and exacerbations of existing cancer must be classified as a serious 
event regardless of the time since discontinuation of the drug and must be reported as described in section 5.2.6.2 , subsections “AE Collection” and “ AE reporting to sponsor and 
timelines”.
5.2.6.1.4 Adverse events of special interest
The term adverse events of special interest (AESI) relates to any specific AE that has been 
identified at the project level as being of particular concern for prospective safety monitoring and safety assessment within this trial, e.g. the potential for AEs based on knowledge from other compounds in the same class. AESIs need to be reported to the sponsor’s Pharmacovigilance Department within the same timeframe that applies to SAEs, please see section 5.2.6.2.2 .
The following are considered as AESIs:
Hepatic injury
A hepatic injury is defined by the following alterations of hepatic laboratory parameters: 
∀An elevation of AST (Aspartate aminotransferase) and/or ALT (Alanine 
aminotransferase) ≥3 fold upper level of normal (ULN) combined with an elevation of 
total bilirubin ≥2 fold ULN measured in the same blood draw sample, or
∀Aminotransferase (ALT, and/or AST) elevations ≥10 fold ULN.
These lab findings constitute a hepatic injury alert and the patients showing these lab 
abnormalities need to be followed up according to the “DILI checklist” provided in the EDC system.  In case of clinical symptoms of hepatic injury (icterus, unexplained encephalopathy, unexplained coagulopathy, right upper quadrant abdominal pain, etc.) without lab results (ALT, AST, total bilirubin) available, the investigator should make sure these parameters are analyzed, if necessary in an unscheduled blood test. Should the results meet the criteria of hepatic injury alert, the procedures described in the DILI checklist should be followed.
No other AESIs have been defined for this trial.

001-MCS-40-106 RD-03 (18 0) / Saved on: 10 Jul 20195.2.6.1.5 Intensity (severity) of AEs
The intensity (severity) of the AE should be judged based on the following:
Mild: Awareness of sign(s) or symptom(s) that is/are easily tolerated.
Moderate: Sufficient discomfort to cause interference with usual activity.Severe: Incapacitating or causing inability to work or to perform usual activities.
5.2.6.1.6 Causal relationship of AEsMedical judgement should be used to determine whether there is a reasonable possibility of a 
causal relationship between the adverse event and the given study treatment, considering all relevant factors, including pattern of reaction, temporal relationship, de-challenge or re-challenge, confounding factors such as concomitant medication, concomitant diseases and relevant history. 
Arguments that may suggest that there is a reasonable possibility of a causal relationship 
could be:
∀The event is consistent with the known pharmacology of the drug.
∀The event is known to be caused by or attributed to the drug class.
∀A plausible time to onset of the event relative to the time of drug exposure.
∀Evidence that the event is reproducible when the drug is re-introduced.
∀No medically sound alternative etiologies that could explain the event (e.g. pre-
existing or concomitant diseases, or co-medications).
∀The event is typically drug-related and infrequent in the general population not 
exposed to drugs (e.g. Stevens-Johnson syndrome).
∀An indication of dose-response (i.e. greater effect size if the dose is increased, smaller 
effect size if dose is reduced).
Arguments that may suggest that there is no reasonable possibility of a causal relationship 
could be:
∀No plausible time to onset of the event relative to the time of drug exposure is evident 
(e.g. pre-treatment cases, diagnosis of cancer or chronic disease within days / weeks 
of drug administration; an allergic reaction weeks after discontinuation of the drug 
concerned).
∀Continuation of the event despite the withdrawal of the medication, taking into 
account the pharmacological properties of the compound (e.g. after 5 half-lives).
Of note, this criterion may not be applicable to events whose time course is prolonged despite removing the original trigger.
∀Additional arguments amongst those stated before, like alternative explanation (e.g. 
situations where other drugs or underlying diseases appear to provide a more likely explanation for the observed event than the drug concerned).
∀Disappearance of the event even though the trial drug treatment continues or remains 
unchanged.

5.2.6.2.1 AE CollectionThe investigator shall maintain and keep detailed records of all AEs in the patient files.
For patients who complete the treatment period, the following must be collected and 
documented on the appropriate CRF(s) by the investigator:
∀From signing the informed consent onwards until the individual patient’s end of trial (the 
EoTrial visit): 
all AEs (serious and non-serious) and all AESIs. 
∀After the individual patient’s end of trial: 
the investigator does not need to actively monitor the patient for new AEs but should 
only report any occurrence of cancer and trial treatment related SAEs and trial treatment related AESIs of which the investigator may become aware of by any means of communication, e.g. phone call. Those AEs should be reported on the BI SAE form (see section 5.2.6.2.2 ), but not on the CRF.
For patients who discontnue treatment  prematurely and continue follow-up in the study (see 
section 6.2.3 ), the following must be collected and documented on the appropriate CRF(s) by 
the investigator:
∀From signing the informed consent onwards until the 28 days after the last study drug 
administration:
all AEs (non-serious and serious) and all AESIs.
∀After 28 days follow-up until the individual patient’s end of trial:
cancers of new histology and exacerbations of existing cancer, all trial treatment related SAEs and all trial treatment related AESIs.
∀After the individual patient’s end of the trial: 
the investigator does not need to actively monitor the patient for new AEs but should report any occurrence of cancer and trial treatment related SAEs and trial treatment related AESIs of which the investigator may become aware of by any means of communication, e.g. phone call. Those AEs should be reported on the BI SAE form (see section 5.2.6.2.2), but not on the CRF.
Patients who discontinue trial medication prematurely, who agree to be contacted further but do not agree to physical visits, should be followed up as described in section 3.3.4.1 , 
withdrawal from trial treatment. From then on until the individual patient’s end of the trial the 
investigator must report all deaths/fatal AEs regardless of relationship, and trial treatment related SAEs and trial treatment related AESIs the investigator becomes aware of.
5.2.6.2.2 AE reporting to the sponsor and timelinesThe investigator must report SAEs, AESIs, and non-serious AEs which are relevant for the 
reported SAE or AESI, on the BI SAE form immediately (within 24 hours) to the sponsor’s unique entry point (country specific reporting process will be provided in the ISF). The same timeline applies if follow-up information becomes available. In specific occasions, the investigator could inform the sponsor upfront via telephone. This does not replace the requirement to complete and send the BI SAE form.

001-MCS-40-106 RD-03 (18 0) / Saved on: 10 Jul 2019With receipt of any further information to these events, a follow-up SAE form has to be provided. For follow-up information the same rules and timeline apply as for initial information. All (S)AEs, including those persisting after individual patient’s end of trial must be followed up until they have resolved, have been assessed as “chronic” or “stable” , or no further information can be obtained.
5.2.6.2.3 PregnancyIn rare cases, pregnancy might occur in a clinical trial. Once a patient has been enrolled in the 
clinical trial and has taken trial medication, the investigator must report any drug exposure during pregnancy in a trial participant immediately (within 24 hours) by means of Part A of the Pregnancy Monitoring Form to the sponsor’s unique entry point.
Similarly, potential drug exposure during pregnancy must be reported if a partner of a male 
trial participant becomes pregnant. This requires written consent of the pregnant partner.Reporting and consenting must be in line with local regulations. The ISF will contain the trial specific information and consent for the pregnant partner.
The outcome of the pregnancy associated with the drug exposure during pregnancy must be 
followed up and reported to the sponsor’s unique entry point on the Pregnancy Monitoring Form for Clinical Studies (Part B).
The ISF will contain the Pregnancy Monitoring Form for Clinical Studies (Part A and B).As pregnancy itself is not to be reported as an AE, in the absence of an accompanying SAE

6.1 VISIT SCHEDULE
All patients have to adhere to the visit schedule as specified in the Flow Chart . Each visit date 
(with its window) is to be counted from Day 1. If any visit has to be rescheduled, subsequent 
visits should follow the original visit date schedule. Additional visits for the purpose of re-
testing of laboratory parameters or AE monitoring may be included as deemed necessary by the investigator.
6.2 DETAILS OF TRIAL PROCEDURES AT SELECTED VISITS
Study procedures to be performed at each visit are listed in the Flow Chart. Additional details 
regarding visit procedures are provided below.
The following requirements for the conduct of the rating scales assessments need to be 
followed:
∀The ZAN-BPD and CGI-S assessments should preferentially be done by the same 
rater for a given patient throughout the study period.
∀During the assessments, patients are allowed to take short breaks as needed, in the 
judgement of the rater/investigator 
∀The site staff must be properly trained and certified by the trial vendor and training 
documentation has to be filed in the ISF; the training standards and standards for the conduct of the assessments will be defined for each assessment individually and can be found in the ISF; it is the responsibility of the Principal Investigator at the site to ensure proper training of all members of the site staff involved in the neuropsychological assessments 
It must be reiterated at all visits per Flow Chart, that WOCBP must use the appropriate 
method of safe contraception according to section 4.2.2.3 . 
During the COVID-19 pandemic, there may be instances that will prevent a patient from 
going to the site for a study visit. This may be, for example, due to restrictions set by authorities or by the investigator site/institution, because the patient is quarantined, or because of any patient-specific situation that the investigator judges as being not safe for the patient to come to the site. 
For details on potential modifications of the trial conduct related to the COVID-19 pandemic, 
please refer to section 10.3.
6.2.1 Screening and run-in period(s)

001-MCS-40-106 RD-03 (18 0) / Saved on: 10 Jul 2019Substance use, e.g., nicotine, alcohol, caffeine, cannabis, etc., will be collected at screening and at subsequent clinic visits. Please refer to the current CRFs for details about substance use to be collected.
IRT
All patients who are screened must be registered with IRT. If the screening results in a screen 
failure, patient must be recorded as screen failure in IRT as soon as possible and within the 28-day screening period. Details of IRT procedures can be found in the IRT Manual filed in the ISF.
Eligibility Review
Eligibility assessment will be performed by an external vendor based on clinical review of the 
SCID-5-CT, SCID-5-PD and ZAN-BPD data and audio recordings from the screening visit, in regard to certain inclusion and exclusion criteria. Uncertainties identified by the external clinical reviewer related to inclusion/exclusion criteria will be discussed with the rater. In cases where an agreement on a patient’s assessments cannot be reached between the site and the external reviewer, the patient should not be randomized. At the conclusion of the eligibility review, the vendor will send a Subject Eligibility Notification to the site. The Subject Eligibility Notification will indicate whether the patient is “eligible” or “ineligible” to proceed to the next steps toward randomization (pending results of other screeningprocedures). 
Retesting
Screening evaluations may be repeated once during the screening period. Rescreening
Rescreening of patients may be done only once based on investigator judgement and prior 
permission from CTL. Patient who are re-screened need to be re-consented and will be given a new patient number. All the study procedures for screening (Visit 1) must be repeated.
Potential reasons for rescreening could be: 
∀Suicidality (once the required EX period is over) (EX 7, 8)
∀Substance abuse (EX 10)
∀Restricted meds like CYPs/ alternative or traditional medicine (EX 11, 12)
∀Clinically significant findings per Investigators judgement (EX 19, 20)
6.2.2 Treatment period
General remarks
After all the screening procedures have been completed and eligibility of screened patients is 
confirmed, Visit 2 can be conducted including randomization via IRT. IRT should not be called in advance of Visit 2 until eligibility is fully confirmed, as randomization of a patient cannot be reserved.
Unscheduled visits will be possible at the discretion of the investigator at any time in order to 
check the safety of the patient or to perform safety laboratory assessments.

001-MCS-40-106 RD-03 (18 0) / Saved on: 10 Jul 20197. STATISTICAL METHODS AND DETERMINATION OF
SAMPLE SIZE
The primary trial objective of this Phase II trial includes demonstration of PoC of the clinical 
activity of BI 1358894 with respect to a non-flat dose response curve, characterization of the dose-response relationship by assessing 4 doses and placebo, and selection of the dose range for phase III development. For this purpose, the primary analysis uses methodology for dosefinding employing both multiple comparison procedures and modelling techniques (MCPMod) to analyze 4 doses of BI 1358894 and placebo ( R10-1424 ). In addition, the 
benefit of BI 1358894 compared to placebo will be evaluated. 
As a basis for the MCPMod analysis, a mixed model for repeated measure (MMRM) analysis 
will be used to generate covariate adjusted estimates of mean change from baseline to Week 10 in ZAN-BPD total score and associated covariance matrices. These estimates will be used as the basis for the PoC analysis using MCPMod. If PoC is established, dose response models will be evaluated to select suitable doses for confirmatory testing in future studies.
7.1 NULL AND ALTERNATIVE HYPOTHESES
The null hypothesis is that there is a flat dose response curve comparing the placebo and the 
BI 1358894 dose groups. The alternative hypothesis is that there is a non-flat dose response curve indicating a benefit of BI 1358894 over placebo.
The MCPMod procedure allows for simultaneous evaluation of different potential dose 
response patterns, while protecting the overall probability of Type I error, using a one-sided, 
nominal α level of 10%. The pre-specified models and their parameters used for this test are 
outlined in section 7.2.2 .
7.2 PLANNED ANALYSES
7.2.1 General considerations
Tabulations of frequencies for categorical data will include all possible categories and will
display the number of observations in a category as well as the percentage (%) relative to therespective treatment group. The category “missing” will be displayed where applicable (i.e.,if and only if there are actually missing values in the data). All data will be listed and summarized by treatment group using appropriate methods. For continuous data, the number of observations, mean, standard deviation (SD), minimum, median and maximum will be provided.
For in-text tables, the set of summary statistics is: N (number of patients with non-missing
values), mean, standard deviation (SD) or median, Q1, Q3, depending on the data. For end-of-text tables, the set of summary statistics is: N/Mean/SD/Q1 (lower quartile)/Median/Q3 (upper quartile). For appendix tables, the set of summary statistics is:N/Mean/SD/Min/Q1/Median/Q3/Max.
Analysis sets defined for this trial include the full analysis set (FAS) and the treated set (TS). 
The FAS comprises all randomized patients who received at least one dose of trial medication

Unless otherwise specified, efficacy analyses will be performed on the FAS and will be based on assigned treatment. Full specifications for the FAS will be provided in the Trial statistical analysis plan (TSAP).
Safety analyses will be conducted on the TS, which includes all randomized patients who 
have received at least one dose of the trial medication. Safety analyses will be conducted using actual treatment received. Data from patients who were screened but not randomized will be listed but not included in any summaries or inferential statistics.
Any deviations from the TSAP will be carefully monitored and reported in the CTR. 
Important protocol deviation are those protocol deviations that have significant impact on patient safety or trial results. Important protocol deviations will be collected throughout the trial conduct and will be summarized in the CTR as defined in the TSAP.
7.2.2 Primary endpoint analyses
7.2.2.1 Primary analyses
As defined in section 2.1.2 , the primary endpoint is the change from baseline to Week 10 in 
ZAN-BPD total score. Baseline refers to the measurement recorded at randomization (Visit 
2), if data at Visit 2 is missing, then data from Visit 1 will be considered baseline. 
The primary estimand of interest is the treatment effect assuming all subjects remained 
adherent to the assigned trial medication and the study protocol using a hypothetical approach, i.e. study drug is taken as directed. The primary analysis of the primary endpoint will include all data collected while on treatment which is defined as the time from the date of the first dose of trial medication until the date of the last dose of trial medication plus 7 days (3 times the estimated elimination half-life). Any data collected after a patient discontinues trial drug, regardless of reason, will be censored and will not be included in the primary analysis. 
The analyses for PoC and dose-finding will be performed using multiple comparison and 
modelling techniques (MCPMod). MCPMod is used to evaluate several possible dose response models (patterns) and to identify the best-fitting model or subset of models based on the BI 1358894 and placebo treatment groups while keeping full control of the type I error at 10%, one-sided. The primary endpoint will be analyzed using a mixed model repeated measures model (MMRM) which is valid under the missing at random (MAR) assumption.Under the MMRM model, there’s no explicit imputation of missing data, rather, the future statistical behavior of those participants who drop out given their past measurements is assumed to be the same as those who remain with the same history.
In particular, between-treatment differences in the change in ZAN-BPD total score at Week 
10 (from baseline) will be evaluated using a MMRM adjusted for treatment arm, clinical visit and baseline ZAN-BPD total score. In addition, participants will be included in the model as a random effect. Additional covariates (such as stable concomitant psychotherapy use (yes/no) and sex) or factors identified prior to database lock may be included in the MMRM model as applicable.

001-MCS-40-106 RD-03 (18 0) / Saved on: 10 Jul 2019The primary treatment comparisons will be the contrasts between each BI 1358894 treatment arm and placebo at Week 10. Procedures to be followed if the planned analysis fails to converge will be described in the TSAP. Resulting adjusted estimates from the MMRM will then be extracted for use in the MCPMod analysis. Parameter estimation of the MMRM willbe based on the residual maximum likelihood method (REML). 
For the PoC testing and for the sample size calculations, the basic shape of each of the 
models to be tested must be predefined. The candidate models in Table 7.2.2.1: 1 wereselected to cover a plausible and diverse range of dose response patterns for the trial medication. Associated graphs of each model are shown in Figure 7.2.2.1: 1 .
Table 7.2.2.1: 1 Models for the MCPMod analysis
Model Estimate Rationale
Emax1 50% of the maximum effect is 
achieved at 25 mgEmax curve corresponds the assumed true estimate of 
ED50=25 mg.
Emax2 70% of the maximum effect is 
achieved at 5 mgTo cover the possibility for which 70% of the 
maximum effect is achieved at 5 mg. This is a 
scenario in which much of the effect is achieved early 
on with relatively low doses. The rationale behind the two Emax models is to construct one (emax1) where the dose response is achieved as expected, while the other (emax2) accounts for the setting of which the assumed dose response is not as expected.
Sigmax 50% of the maximum effect is 
achieved at 25 mg, and
90% of the maximum effect is 
achieved at 75 mgAnother more flexible model to cover the new 
estimate ED50=25 mg
Exponential 5% of the maximum effect is 
achieved at 25 mgTo cover the case where the effect of drug is mainly 
achieved at the higher doses.
Linear No parameter assumptions required In the event, dose response is linear.
The models were based on the following assumptions:
∀BI 1358894 dose groups 5mg, 25mg, 75mg, 125mg and 
∀ED50 = 25 mg *
* ED50 assumes dose corresponding to EC50, FST = 77nM plasma concentration in trough at 16h.
EC50: Half maximal effective concentrationEC50 of a graded dose response curve represents the concentration of a compound where 50% of its maximal effect is 
observed.
FST: forced swim test (in mice)
A non-flat dose response is established if at least one dose response pattern is statistically 
significant, rejecting the null hypothesis of a flat dose response relationship over change from baseline to Week 10 in ZAN-BD total score jointly for each of the candidate models with a contrast test controlled for the family-wise type I error rate at one-sided α = 10%.

001-MCS-40-106 RD-03 (18 0) / Saved on: 10 Jul 2019If a non-flat response is established, the statistically significant (i.e., best fitting) model(s) are refitted to the data to generate new estimates for all model parameters. The final model will be obtained via model averaging across the significant models based on Akaike Information Criteria. The target dose(s) can be estimated from each significant model by incorporating information on the minimum clinically relevant effect. Safety will be taken into account in the selection of a target dose(s).

Sensitivity analyses to assess the robustness of the primary analysis outcomes to the 
assumption of MAR will be described in the TSAP.

Adverse events will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Drug Regulatory Activities 
(MedDRA). Standard BI summary tables and listings will be produced. All adverse events with an onset between start of treatment and end of the period of 28 days after the last dose of trial medication, will be assigned to the on-treatment period for evaluation.
All treated patients will be included in the safety analysis. In general, safety analyses will be 
descriptive in nature and will be based on BI standards. No hypothesis testing is planned.
Statistical analysis and reporting of adverse events will concentrate on treatment-emergent 
adverse events, i.e. all adverse events occurring between start of treatment and end of the REP. Adverse events that start before first drug intake and deteriorate under treatment will also be considered as ‘treatment-emergent’.
Frequency, severity, and causal relationship of adverse events will be tabulated by system 
organ class and preferred term after coding according to the current version of the MedDRAat database lock.
Laboratory data will be analyzed both quantitatively as well as qualitatively. The latter will 
be done via comparison of laboratory data to their reference ranges. Values outside the reference range as well as values defined as clinically relevant will be summarized. Treatment groups will be compared descriptively with regard to distribution parameters as well as with regard to frequency and percentage of patients with abnormal values or clinically relevant abnormal values.
Vital signs, physical examinations, or other safety-relevant data observed at screening, 
baseline, during the course of the trial and at the end-of-trial evaluation will be assessed with regard to possible changes compared to findings before start of treatment.

No interim analysis is planned. A Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will review safety data 
during the trial as described in section 8.7.
7.3 HANDLING OF MISSING DATA
Every effort will be made to collect complete data at all visits. The primary estimand of 
interest is the treatment effect assuming all participants remain adherent to the assigned trial medication and trial protocol using a hypothetical approach. For the primary analysis of the primary endpoint, missing data will not be imputed. Data collected after discontinuation of trial medication will be censored for the primary analysis. The mixed effects model will handle missing data based on a likelihood method under the assumption of missing at random. 
For the supplemental analysis of the primary endpoint based on a treatment policy estimand, 
i.e. intention to treat, all available data including data collected after treatment discontinuation or other intercurrent event will be analyzed. 
Sensitivity analyses may be conducted utilizing multiple imputation techniques for the 
primary and supplemental analyses of the primary endpoint. Similar methods for handling missing data will be used for secondary efficacy endpoints, as applicable. With respect to

7.4 RANDOMISATION
Participants will be randomly assigned to treatment in a 2.5:1:1:1:2 ratio as described in 
section 4.1.3 . Randomization will be stratified by baseline ZAN-BPD total score ( ≤18 vs.
≥19).
BI will arrange for the randomization and the packaging and labelling of trial medication. 
The randomization list will be generated using a validated system, which involves a pseudo-random number generator so that the resulting treatment will be both reproducible and non-predictable. The block size will be documented in the Clinical trial report (CTR). Access tothe codes will be controlled and documented as described in section 4.1.5.1 .
7.5 DETERMINATION OF SAMPLE SIZE
Sample size is estimated assuming a maximum standardized effect size of 0.32, which is 
based on a mean difference between placebo and BI 1358894 of 3.0 and standard deviation of 9.5 for the primary endpoint, a one-sided alpha of 0.10, a treatment allocation ratio of 2.5:1:1:1:2 (placebo, BI 5mg, BI 25mg, BI 75mg, BI 125mg, respectively) and the pre-specified models listed in section 7.2.2.1 . Information on the change from baseline and its 
standard deviation is limited since there is no BoPD approved drug. BoPD is a symptomatic 
and clinically heterogeneous condition and in clinical studies a high discontinuation rate has been observed. Consequently, sample size assumptions are based on expert opinion, previous BoPD research and a quetiapine pivotal trial ( R19-1108 , R19-1645 , P11-04859 ).
For the PoC analysis of the BI 1358894 dose groups and placebo using MCPMod approach 
with the parameters as listed in section 7.2.2 , a sample size of 285 (95:38:38:38:76) evaluable 
patients are needed to establish PoC with about 81% average power (one-sided 10% alpha 
level). The powers for each model shape under different assumptions are summarized in the table below.
Assuming a 20% dropout rate is considered reasonable based on unique characteristics of this 
population. Therefore, a total sample size of approximately 355 randomized patients are needed for this phase II trial:
∀119 patients in placebo arm
∀47 patients in each of the three lowest BI 1358894 arms
∀95 patients in the highest BI 1358894 arm 
The calculations for the PoC step have been performed using DoseFinding R-package ( R15-
2001 ).The R codes for the sample size calculations as well as the analyses using the 
MCPMod approach will be provided in the TSAP. The family–wise type I error rate at one 
sided α = 10% is controlled in the sample size calculations and the analyses.

8.2 DATA QUALITY ASSURANCE
A risk-based approach is used for trial quality management. It is initiated by the assessment 
of critical data and processes for trial subject protection and reliability of the results as well as identification and assessment of associated risks. An Integrated Quality and Risk Management Plan documents the rationale and strategies for risk management during trial conduct including monitoring approaches, vendor management and other processes focusing on areas of greatest risk.
Continuous risk review and assessment may lead to adjustments in trial conduct, trial design 
or monitoring approaches. 
A quality assurance audit/inspection of this trial may be conducted by the sponsor, sponsor’s 
designees, or by IRB / IEC or by regulatory authorities. The quality assurance auditor will have access to all medical records, the investigator’s trial-related files and correspondence, and the informed consent documentation of this clinical trial.
In order to achieve a high level of process standardization, data collection of 
neuropsychological assessments will be coordinated centrally by a third party vendor. Services to be provided include:
∀Rater pre-qualification
∀Rater training (face-to-face and online)
∀Provision of rater materials
∀Central quality review of the SCID-5-CT, SCID-5-PD and ZAN-BPD assessments. For 
this purpose, SCID-5-CT, SCID-5-PD and ZAN-BPD interviews will be recorded (audio only).
Details of raters’ pre-qualifications, raters’ training, raters’ materials (including assessments) 
and the central review procedures will be described in the vendor documentation available in TMF. All data corrections to rating assessments requested by the sites will be processed and tracked by the vendor. Data corrections made to rating assessments will be reviewed by a vendor

All data collected in, and access to, the system is captured in an audit trail, which includes an unalterable time and date stamp and the authorized user’s identification for each data point and action.
In addition, patients will be offered to watch a short informational video intended to educate 
the patient about placebos, and why they are used in clinical trials. The video advises the patient not to attempt to guess if they are on active drug or placebo, reminds them that there is always a chance they may have been randomly assigned placebo, and stresses the importance of reporting all symptoms, be they positive or negative or neutral.
8.3 RECORDS
eCRFs for individual patients will be provided by the sponsor. See section 4.1.5.2   for rules 
about emergency code breaks. For drug accountability, refer to section 4.1.8 .
8.3.1 Source documents
In accordance with regulatory requirements, the investigator should prepare and maintain 
adequate and accurate source documents and trial records that include all observations and other data pertinent to the investigation on each trial patient. Source data as well as reported data should follow the “ALCOA principles” and be attributable, legible, contemporaneous, 
original and accurate. Changes to the data should be traceable (audit trail). Data reported on 
the eCRFs must be consistent with the source data or the discrepancies must be explained.
Electronic records, i.e. clinician administered assessment data, related audio recordings (for 
central review) and patient reported outcome data, entered into the tablet (Rater Station) will be regarded as source data. These may be further analyzed by the third-party vendor. 
The electronic version of the ECG is regarded as source documentation. Dated and signed 
printouts should be stored in the patient’s medical file.
In case local laboratory is used for ESR or due to COVID-19 related variations, local 
laboratory results report will be considered as source document. The investigator must maintain in the ISF both local laboratory results and corresponding reference ranges. 
The current medical history of the patient may not be sufficient to confirm eligibility for the 
trial and the investigator may need to request previous medical histories and evidence of any diagnostic tests. In this case, the investigator must make at least three documented attempts to retrieve previous medical records. If this fails, a verbal history from the patient, documented in their medical records, would be acceptable.
If the patient is not compliant with the protocol, any corrective action e.g. re-training must be 
documented in the patient file.
For the CRF, data must be derived from source documents, for example:
∀Patient identification: gender, year of birth (in accordance with local laws and 
regulations)

discontinuation document the reason for it).
∀Prior to allocation of a patient to a treatment into a clinical trial, there must be 
documented evidence in the source data (e.g. medical records) that the trial participant meets all inclusion criteria and does not meet any exclusion criteria. The absence of records (either medical records, verbal documented feedback of the patient or testing conducted specific for a protocol) to support inclusion/exclusion criteria, does not make the patient eligible for the clinical trial.
8.3.2 Direct access to source data and documents
The investigator /institution will allow site trial-related monitoring, audits, IRB / IEC review 
and regulatory inspections. Direct access must be provided to the eCRF and all source documents/data, including progress notes, copies of laboratory and medical test results, which must be available at all times for review by the CRA, auditor and regulatory inspector (e.g. FDA). They may review all CRFs and informed consents. The accuracy of the data will be verified by direct comparison with the source documents described in section 8.3.1 .T h e  
sponsor will also monitor compliance with the protocol and GCP.
8.3.3 Storage period of records

001-MCS-40-106 RD-03 (18 0) / Saved on: 10 Jul 201910.3 POTENTIAL MODIFICATION OF TRIAL CONDUCT IN CASE OF 
RESTRICTIONS DUE TO COVID-19
As mentioned in section 6.2, in case of any restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic, 
study conduct may need to be adjusted. The following contingency measures have been 
introduced to ensure participant safety and appropriate trial continuation based on a thorough benefit-risk assessment (see section 1.4.2 ). In addition, collection of efficacy COAs remotely 
would support evaluation of study endpoints, with the focus on the primary and secondary 
endpoints, by reducing missing data. 
Accordingly, when it is impossible to conduct the visits at the trial site, visits may be 
performed via telemedicine (video-enabled internet-based means of communication or audio only) or at the patient’s home (e.g., by a study nurse). Visits may also be performed as a 
combination of home visit and telemedicine. For such cases, the visit procedures may be adjusted, after evaluation of operational feasibility and minimal required data (i.e. primary /secondary /exploratory endpoints. etc.), whereby critical safety measures will remain in place. All telemedicine/home visits must be discussed with and approved by the sponsor`s trial team.
Local regulatory and legal requirements of the participating country must be respected for all 
modifications. Under these circumstances, the below modifications can be considered. Patients must be informed about the modifications and give their consent before implementation.
Telemedicine visit
For telemedicine visits, video is the preferred mode. Every effort should be made to conduct 
the telemedicine visit via video. If for a visit, video communication is not possible, then assessments can be performed via audio. The mode of administration (i.e., in person, video, or audio only) will be recorded in the eCRFs.
Prior to implementing telemedicine visits, sites/raters will receive additional training on the 
administration of assessments remotely. The objectives of the training will be to standardize the administration of the assessments and ensure consistent monitoring of patient safety in a remote setting. Instructions on the logistics, recommended interview environment, and the identity verification plan will also be addressed in the training. The training will also include patient safety measures for telemedicine visit. At the beginning of each telemedicine visit, Telemedicine Checklist (available in the ISF) must be completed.
Prior to the first telemedicine visit, sites should conduct a brief session with the patient to 
evaluate the technology and connectivity requirements for the remote visit. 
The following should be ensured for remote visits:
∀Raters must conduct telemedicine visit from a suitable location to protect patient privacy 
and confidentiality
∀Identification of the reviewer and the patient must be confirmed
∀Confirm patient’s location in case of emergency identified during the remote visit

In this study, telemedicine refers to the administration of assessments via video or audio, please see Section 10.3 for further details. 
If telemedicine assessments need to be 
implemented due to COVID-19 related factors, it will be assumed that there is no discernible difference between the in-person and telemedicine (video) administration of the ZAN-BPD. All data while patients are on treatment, whether in-person or telemedicine (video) will be included in the evaluation of the primary endpoint. However, any ZAN-BPD assessment conducted by audio administration will be excluded from the primary analysis. Any data collected after a patient discontinues trial drug, regardless of reason, will be censored and will not be included in the primary analysis.Sensitivity analyses for the primary analysis of 
the primary endpoint - telemedicine
If telemedicine assessments need to be implemented, sensitivity analyses of the primary endpoint will be performed to assess the robustness of the primary analysis results.  The sensitivity analyses will assess the integration of the different modes (i.e., in-person, video, and audio) for administrating the ZAN-BPD. The details related to these sensitivity analyses will be provided within the TSAP.

1.1 Synopsis  
Protocol Title:   
Sponsor Study No.:  
Phase : 2 
Sponsor:  Apnimed, Inc.  
Rationale: 
Apnimed is developing the combination of atomoxetine and oxybutynin for the treatment of 
obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) . Initial Phase 2 studies of the combination were conducted with 
marketed oxybutynin (combination designated AD -036), which is a racemic  mixture o f R- and S-
oxybutynin. Subsequent development is being pursued with R -oxybutynin (combination 
designated AD -109), a new enantiomerically pure form of oxybutynin which is proposed to have 
an improved safety and efficacy profile in OSA  compared to  racemic oxybutynin .   
Previous s tudies of AD -036 provided dose- response efficacy and safety data across a broad 
spectrum of OSA disease severity. Study APC -004 is designed to extend and confirm these 
findings to AD -109 in a population with mild- to moderate OSA , in parallel with other studies of 
AD-109 planned by Apnimed in moderate- to severe OSA.  
Overall Design : 
Study AP C-004 is a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled, 3-period, single-dose 
crossover study in patients with mild - to moderate OSA. A screening visit and polysomnographic  
(PSG) exam will be conducted to establish that each participant meets study enrollment criteria . 
Each participant will then  receive a single dose of each of the following during 3 overnight PSG 
exams, each separated by a one week washout period : 
• Atomoxetine 75 mg + R -oxybutynin 2.5 mg (i.e. 75/2.5) 
• Atomoxetine 37.5 mg + R -oxybutynin 2.5 mg (i.e. 37.5/2.5) 
• Placebo  
Primary efficacy and safety endpoints will compare the 75/2.5 and 37.5/2.5 doses to each other 
and to placebo.

2.1 Study Rationale  
Previous studies conducted by Apnimed (under IND 136752) and academic investigators support 
that the combination of atomoxetine and oxybutynin is safe and effective for the treatment of OSA. These i nitial Phase 2 studies of the combination were conducted with marketed oxybutynin 
(combination designated AD -036), which is a ra cemic mixture of R - and S-oxybutynin. 
Subsequent development (under IND 141505) is being pursued by Apnimed with R -oxybutynin 
(combination designated AD -109), a new enantiomerically pure form of oxybutynin which is 
proposed to have an improved safety and e fficacy profile in OSA compared to racemic 
oxybutynin.   
Previous studies of AD-036 provided dose- response efficacy and safety data across a range of 
doses. Doses of atomoxetine ranged  between 25 mg and 80 mg , and doses of racemic oxybutynin 
between 1.5 and 5 mg. Combinations with the highest doses were clearly more effective than 
combinations with the lowe st doses, with mid -range doses retaining substantial efficacy. All 
doses were safe and well -tolerated, with suggestion of positive correlation between dose and 
generally mild adverse effects. Study APC -004 is designed to extend and confirm these findings 
to AD-109, combining a dose of 2.5 mg R-oxybutynin with either 75 mg or 37.5 mg atomoxetine. Study APC -004 will enroll patients with mild - to moderate OSA, in parallel with 
other studies of AD-109 planned by Apnimed in moderate- to severe OSA.   
 
2.2 Background  
2.2.1 Obstructive Sleep  Apnea  
The National Commission on Sleep Disorders Research identified sleep disorders as a major 
public health burden. OSA is the most common and serious of these sleep disorders and affects 
approximately 20 million people in the United States ( US), with approximately 13% of men and 
6% of women affected  (Peppard et al, 2013) . OSA is characterized  by repetitive collapse or 
‘obstruction’ of the pharyngeal airway during sleep, manifesting as repetitive episodes of 
hypopnea (i.e., shallow breathing) or apnea (i.e., paused breathing). These episodes of hypopnea 
or apnea may lead to arousal from sleep,  sleep fragmentation, excessive daytime sleepiness, 
and/or neuropsychological impairment.  
Research has shown that a number of pathogenic factors, or traits, contribute to the development 
of OSA  (Eckert et al, 2013; Wellman et al, 2011 ; Wellman et al,  2013;Younes, 2003) . The most 
Apnimed, Inc.  Clinical Study Protocol  
Protocol APC -004/IND 141505 CONFIDENTIAL  
 
6 January  2020  10 of 54 V2.0 important factors are the presence of  an anatomically small, collapsible upper airway and a loss 
of pharyngeal muscle tone or responsiveness during sleep.  
Long -term, OSA is associated with increased mortality and a number of  adverse cardiovascular , 
neurocognitive, metabolic, and daytime functioning consequences (Somers  et al, 1995 ; Nieto  et al, 
2000; Brooks  et al, 1997; Peppard  et al, 2000; Hung  et al, 1990; Wessendorf  et al, 2000; Hoffstein, 1994; 
Shahar et al, 2001 ; Redline et al, 1997; Findley  et al, 1988) . 
2.2.2 Unmet Medical  Need  
Treatment for OSA changed little over the past 40 years, with the overwhelming majority of 
patients treated with positive airway pressure, the most common of which is continuous positive 
airway pressure (CPAP), provided by a machine that mechanically maintains an open airway. 
Other treatments, such as pharyngeal surgery,  mandibular advancement devices, and implantable 
nerve stimulators, were developed to address the anatomical predisposition to collapse; however, they have shown limited efficacy  for niche populations. 
While CPAP and related therapies are effective in improving sleep characteristics  and 
oxygenation, many, perhaps most, patients find these devices uncomfortable or intolerable, and 
most estimates indicate that fewer than 50% of patients prescribed  CPAP  use it more than 4 hours 
per night, if at all (Weaver and Sawyer, 2010). Efforts to develop pharmacologic therapies, such 
as antidepressants, stimulants, and hormonal agents, for the treatment of OSA have been ongoing for at least 20 years, with no success thus far. 
As many patients cannot use CPAP because they find it intolerable, this represents a significant 
health concern, as OSA is associated with numerous co- morbidities  and increased mortality. 
Alternative options, such as drugs that activate the  pharyngeal muscles , are needed.  
2.2.3 Biological Rationale  
AD109 is a new fixed dose drug combination of atomoxetine and R-oxybutynin being developed 
for OSA. Atomoxetine is a pre -synaptic norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor indicated for the 
treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder  in children and adults. R-oxybutynin has never 
been marketed, but racemic o xybutynin is  approved as  an antispasmodic drug that inhibits the 
muscarinic action o f acetylcholine on smooth muscle and is indicated for the treatment of 
symptoms of bladder instability associated with voiding in patients with uninhibited neurogenic 
or reflex neurogenic bladder such as urgency, frequency, urinary leakage, urge incontinence  and 
dysuria.   
Apnimed, Inc.  Clinical Study Protocol  
Protocol APC -004/IND 141505 CONFIDENTIAL  
 
6 January  2020  11 of 54 V2.0 Efficacy  of oxybutynin in overactive bladder may result both from antimuscarinic effects of 
oxybutynin and smooth muscle spasmolytic effects. The contribution to efficacy of oxybutynin in 
OSA is believed to be related to antimuscarinic eff ects, whereas spasmolytic effects may lead to 
effects on the bladder that are undesirable in typical OSA patients. The R -enantiomer  of 
oxybutynin has been shown to confer the antimuscarinic effect of oxybutynin, whereas the 
spasmolytic effects (and other effects on calcium channel antagonism and local anesthetic effects) are non -stereoselective properties of both the enantiomers.  Apnimed therefore believes that the 
combination of the R -enantiomer of oxybutynin with atomoxetine  may have an improved safety 
and efficacy profile in OSA compared to the combination with the racemate of oxybutynin.

4 Study Design  
4.1 Overall Design  
Study APC -004 is a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled, 3-period, single-dose 
crossover study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of two different dose combinations of AD-109 in patients with mild - to moderate OSA. Participants will undergo initial pre -screening to  Endpoints

6 January  2020  12 of 54 V2.0 determine potential study eligibility . Patients selected for further screening should either  have a 
previous history of OSA of a severity consistent with enrollment criteria or be at high risk (e.g. 
as assessed by STOP -Bang Questio nnaire score).  Only patients who meet all non- PSG 
enrollment criteria at Visit 1  are eligible for a screening PSG .  
Patients  who meet all enrollment criteria  will be randomized  to receive the following 
experimental treatments , one treatment  on each of 3 PSG night, separated by at least a  one week 
washout period: 
• Atomoxetine 75 mg + R-oxybutynin 2.5 mg (i.e. 75/2.5) 
• Atomoxetine 37.5 mg + R-oxybutynin 2.5 mg (i.e. 37.5/2.5) 
• Placebo  
Dosing of the study treatment will occur immediately prior to lights out. The morning following 
each PSG exam in the crossover period the DSST, KSS, and sleep quality VAS will be 
administered  approximately 1 hour after awakening.  
Each PSG night is followed by a 1-week washout period. AE/SAE information is recorded at 
each study vi sit and by telephone contact with participants during each washout period. 
Primary efficacy and safety endpoints will compare the 75/2.5 and 37.5/2.5 doses to each other and to placebo. AE/SAE information is recorded at each study visit and at the  End of S tudy 
Evaluation. 
Participants who withdraw from the study will not be replaced . No subsequent open- label 
extension is planned following the study.

4.2 Scientific Rationale for Study Design  and Dose  
Previous Phase 2 studies conducted by Apnimed and academic collaborators support that the 
combination of atomoxetine and racemic oxybutynin is effective for OSA over a wide range of 
disease severity.  This study will extend findings in patients with mild - to moderate OSA, 
whereas other planned studies will examine patients with moderate - to severe OSA.  
This study is designed to provide additional dose ranging efficacy and safety data for doses of atomoxetine in the middle - and higher -range of doses previously studied. Completed studies of 
AD036 support efficacy and safety of 5 mg racemic oxybutynin in combination with 
atomoxetine . Because the R -enantiomer of oxybutynin confers about 2-fold the anticholinergic 
activity of the racemate, with such activity thought to be the major contributor to efficacy in 
OSA, the dose of R-oxybutynin will be 2.5 mg in this study. 
A detailed description of the chemistry, pharmacology, efficacy, and safety of AD109 is provided in the Investigator’s Brochure.  
4.3 End of Study Definition  
A participant is considered to have completed the study if he/she has completed all phases of the study through the last scheduled procedure shown in the Schedule of Activities ( SoA). 
The end of the study is defined as the  date of  the last visit of the last participant in the study or last 
scheduled procedure shown in the SoA for the last participant in the study globally.

6 January  2020  20 of 54 V2.0 3. The Investigator, institution, or the hea d of the medical institution (where applicable) is 
responsible for study treatment accountability, reconciliation, and record maintenance 
(i.e., receipt, reconciliation, and final disposition records). 
4. After receiving Sponsor approval in writing, sites are responsible for returning all unused 
or partially used study treatment to the Sponsor or designated third party or for preparing the study treatment for destruction via incineration. 
6.3 Measures to Minimize Bias: Randomization and Blinding  
All participants will be centrally randomized for the crossover phase of the study. Each 
participant will be assigned a unique number (randomization number) that encodes the participant’s assignment to 1 of the sequences of the study, according to the randomization 
schedule using a validated computer program.  
Returned study treatment should not be redispensed to the participants. In case of an emergency, the Investigator has the sole responsibility for determining if 
unblinding of a participant’s study tre atment assignment is warranted. Participant safety must 
always be the first consideration in making such a determination. If the Investigator decides that unblinding is warranted, the Investigator should make every effort to contact the Sponsor prior to unblinding a participant’s study treatment assignment unless this could delay emergency 
treatment of the participant. If a participant’s study treatment assignment is unblinded, the 
Sponsor must be notified within 24 hours after breaking the blind. The date and reason that the 
blind was broken must be recorded in the source documentation and electronic case report form (eCRF), as applicable.  
In the event of a Quality Assurance audit, the auditor(s) will be allowed access to unblinded study treatment records a t the site(s) to verify that randomization/dispensing has been done 
accurately.  
6.4 Concomitant Therapy

6.8 Loss of Participants to Follow-Up  
A participant will be considered lost to follow -up if he or she repeatedly fails to return for 
scheduled visits and is unable to be contacted by the study site. The following actions must be 
taken if a participant fails to return to the clinic for a required study visit: 
• The site must attempt to contact the participant and reschedule the missed visit as soon as 
possible (and within the visit window, where one is defined) and counsel the participant on 
the importance of maintaining the assigned visit schedule and ascertain whether or not the 
participant wishes to and/or should continue in the study. 
• In cases in which the participant is deemed lost to follow -up, the Investigator or designee 
must make every effort to regain contact with the participant (where possible, 3 telephone 
calls and, if necessary, a certified letter to the participant ’s last known mailing address or 
local equivalent methods). These contact attempts should be documented in the participant’ s 
medic al record/ eCRF . 
• Should the participant continue to be unreachable, he/she will be considered to have withdrawn from the study. 
7 Study Assessments and Procedures  
• Study procedures and their timing are summarized in the SoA. 
• Adherence to the study design requirements, including those specified in the SoA, is essential and required for study conduct. 
• All screening evaluations must be completed and reviewed to confirm that potential 
participants meet all eligibility criteria. The Investigator will maintain a screening log to 
record details of all participants screened and to confirm eligibility or recor d reasons for 
screening failure, as applicable.  
• The maximum amount of blood collected from each participant over the duration of the 
study, excluding any extra assessments that may be required  for safety or technical issues , 
will not exceed approximately  50 mL.  
• Repeat or unscheduled samples may be taken for safety reasons or for technical issues with the samples , as per the Investigator or designee’ s discretion .

Protocol APC -004/IND 141505 CONFIDENTIAL  
 
6 January  2020  25 of 54 V2.0 7.1.1 Polysomnography  
• Methods : Standard overnight PSG recording and data interpretation will be performed in 
accordance with the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) scoring manual . 
Participant s will be instrumented with standard PSG electrodes . Time of lights out will be 
established according to the participant s’ habitual schedule and kept constant a cross the PSG 
study nights. The participants will be given 8 hours of time -in bed. 
• Scoring: A ll PSG studies (including screening PSG) will be scored by centralized PSG 
technologists, blinded to treatment assignment. Scoring will be conducted according to the 
American Academy of Sleep Medicine manual scoring criteria . 
7.2 Safety Assessments 
• Planned time points for all safety assessments are provided in the SoA. 
• Safety monitoring will be guided by the established safety profiles of atomoxetine and 
oxybutynin, and by Phase 1 and 2 safety data for the combination . Safety assessments will 
include physical examinations , measurement of vital signs, monitoring and recording of AEs , 
SAEs , and pregnancies , recording of study or treatment discontinuations. Ef fects on  OSA and  
sleep parameters (e.g., sleep time and sleep stages) will also be monitored by PSG . 
• Adverse events of special interest include effects on urine outflow, as both atomoxetine and 
oxybutynin are associated with urinary retention. Effects of atomoxetine on heart rate and blood pressure are expected to be modest, as indicated by the initial data described above, and will also be monitored. Participant s with serious cardiac abnormalities will be excluded 
from the study. Suicidal ideation in child ren and adolescents is a boxed warning for 
atomoxetine; however, analysis in adult patients , the target population for the proposed OSA 
study, did not reveal an increased risk of suicidal ideation or behavior in association with atomoxetine.  Daytime sleepiness is both a potential safety outcome and efficacy outcome in 
OSA. Both atomoxetine and oxybutynin may be  associated with somnolence, and oxybutynin 
is additionally associated with anticholinergic CNS effects such as  memory difficulty.  
7.2.1 Physical Examinations  
• The general physical examination at screenin g includes an assessment of general appearance 
and a review of physical systems (dermatologic, head, eyes, ears, nose, mouth/throat/neck, 
thyroid, lymph nodes, respiratory, cardiovascular, gastrointe stinal, extremities, 
musculoskeletal, neurologic, and psychiatric systems). Height and weight will also be 
measured and recorded (with shoes removed and wear ing light indoor clothing). 
Apnimed, Inc.  Clinical Study Protocol  
Protocol APC -004/IND 141505 CONFIDENTIAL  
 
6 January  2020  26 of 54 V2.0 • Investigators should pay special attention to clinical signs related to  previous serious 
illnesses.  
7.2.2 Vital Signs  
• Assessment of vital signs (seated blood pressure, pulse rate, body temperature, respiratory 
rate) will be performed at the time points indicated in the SoA.  
• Vital signs will be measured at all visits in a seated position after 5  minutes rest and will 
include temperature, respiratory rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and pulse. 
Measurements should be made in the same arm of the participant at each vi sit. 
• Systolic and diastolic blood pressure will be repeated for a total of 3 measurements, each at least 2  minutes apart.  
• The method used to measure body temperature at screening should be maintained throughout the study for each participant, and should be indicated (e.g. , ear, mouth, armpit). 
7.2.3 Electrocardiograms  
• A 12 -lead ECG will be obtained using an ECG machine that automatically calculates the 
heart rate and measures the PR, QRS, and QT  intervals . The ECG will be recorded in the 
semi -supine position afte r the participant has rested in this position for at least 10  minutes.  
7.2.4 Clinical Safety Laboratory Assessments  
• Refer to Section  9.2 for the list of clinical laborato ry tests to be performed and to the SoA for 
the timing and frequency. 
• The Investigator must review the laboratory report and  document this review. The laboratory 
reports must be filed with the source documents.  
• All protocol- required laboratory assessments  must be conducted in accordance with the 
laboratory manual and the SoA. 
• If laboratory values from laboratory assessments not specified in the protocol and performed at the institution ’s local laboratory result in the need for a change in participant manag ement 
or are considered clinically relevant by the Investigator ( e.g., are considered to be an SAE or 
an AE or require dose modification), then the results must be recorded in the e CRF.

6 January  2020  27 of 54 V2.0 7.3 Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
The definitions of AEs and SAEs can be found in Appendix 3. 
Adverse event s will be reported by the participant (or, when appropriate, by a caregiver, 
surrogate, or the participant's legally authorized r epresentative).  
The Investigator and any qualified designees are responsible for detecting, documenting, and 
reporting events that meet the definition of an AE or SAE and remain responsible for following 
up on AEs that are serious, considered related to th e study treatment  or the study, or that caused 
the participant to discontinue the study and/or study treatment. 
7.3.1 Time Period and Frequency for Collecting AE and SAE Information  
All AEs and SAEs will be collected from randomization until the end of the study at the 
timepoints specified in the SoA. 
All SAEs will be recorded and reported to the Sponsor or designee within 24 hours, as indicated 
in Appendix 3. Th e Investigator will submit any updated SAE data to the Sponsor within 
24 hours of it being available. 
Investigators are not obligated  to actively seek AEs or SAEs after the conclusion of study 
participation. However, if the Investigator learns of any SAE, including a death, at any time after 
a participant has been discharged from the study, and he/she considers the event to be reasonably 
related to the study treatment or study participation, the Investigator must promptly notify the 
Sponsor. 
The method of recording, evaluating, and assessing causality of AEs and SAEs and the 
procedures for completing and transmitting SAE reports are provided in Appendix 3. 
7.3.2 Method of Detecting AE s and SAEs  
Care will be taken not to introduce bias when detecting AEs and/or SAEs. Open-ended and non-leading verbal questioning of the participant is the preferred method to inquire about AE occurrence.  
7.3.3 Follow -up of AEs and SAEs  
After the initial AE/SAE report, the Investigator is required to proactively follow each participant 
at subsequent visits/contacts. All SAEs  will be followed until resolution, stabilization, until the 
Apnimed, Inc.  Clinical Study Protocol

follow-up procedures is given in Appendix 3. 
7.3.4 Regulatory Reporting Requirements for SAE s 
• Prompt notification (within 24 hours, see Appendix 3) by the Investigator to the Sponsor of 
an SAE is essential so that legal obligations and ethical responsibilities towards the safety of participants and the safety of a study treatment under clinical investigation are met.  
• The Sponsor has a legal responsibility to notify both the local regulatory authority and other 
regulatory agencies about the safety of a study treatment under clinical investigation. The 
Sponsor will comply with country- specific regulatory requirements relating to safety 
reporting to the regulatory authority, IRB/Independent Ethics Committees (IEC), and 
Investigators. 
• Investigator safety reports must be prepared for suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions ( SUSAR) according to local regulatory requirements and Sponsor policy and 
forwarded to Investigators as necessary.  
• An Investigator who receives an Investigator safety report describing an SAE or other specific safety information (e .g., summary or listing of  SAE) from the Sponsor will file it 
along with the Investigator’s Brochure and will notify the IRB/IEC, if appropriate according to local requirements.  
7.3.5 Pregnancy  
• Details of all pregnancies in female participants after the start of study treatment and until at least 5 terminal half -lives after the last dose will be collected .  
• If a pregnancy is reported, the Investigator should inform the Sponsor within 24 hours of learning of the pregnancy and should follow the procedures outlined in Appendix 4. 
• Abnormal pregnancy outcomes (e.g., spontaneous abortion, fetal death, stillbirth, congenital anomalies, ectopic pregnancy) are considered to be SAEs.  
7.4 Treatment of Overdos e 
For this study, any dose of atomoxetine  hydrochloride greater than  75 mg and of R-oxybutynin 
chloride greater than 2.5 mg more frequently than QHS will be considered an overdose. 
Apnimed, Inc.  Clinical Study Protocol  
Protocol APC -004/IND 141505 CONFIDENTIAL  
 
6 January  2020  29 of 54 V2.0 In the event of an overdose , the Investigator should refer to the approved product label for advice 
on overdose and: 
1. Contact the Medical Monitor immediately.  
2. Closely monitor the participant for AE/SAE and laboratory abnormalities until atomoxetine 
hydrochloride  and/or R-oxybutynin chloride can no longer be detected systemically.  
3. Obtain a plasma sample for PK analysis within 1 day  from the date of the last dose of study 
treatment  if requested by the Medical Monitor (determined on a case by  case basis).  
4. Document the quantity of the excess dose as well as the duration of the overdosing in the 
eCRF.  
Decisions regarding dose interruptions or modifications will be made by the Investigator in 
consultation with  the Medical Monitor based on the clinical evaluation of the participant. 
7.5 Pharmacokinetics  
PK parameters are not evaluated in this study.  
8 Statistical Considerations  
8.1 Sample Size Determination  
A total of  30 patients will enter th e 3-treatment crossover study. The study will have 80% power 
to detect a treatment difference on the primary endpoint at a two -sided 0.05 significance level, if 
the true difference between treatments on HB  is at least -3.7 %min/h . This assumes that the 
within -subject standard deviation is 9 and a discontinuation rate of  less than 20%.

before the participant was enrolled in the study and the date the written consent was obtained. The authorized person obtaining the informed consent must also sign the ICF. 
• Participants must be re -consented to the most current version of the ICF(s) during their 
participation in the study.  
• A copy of the signed ICF(s) must be provided to the participant or the participant’ s legally 
authorized representative. 
If a pr otocol amendment is required, the ICF may need to be revised to reflect the changes to the 
protocol. If the ICF is revised, it must be reviewed and approved by the appropriate IEC/IRB, 
and signed by all participants  subsequently enrolled in the study as we ll as those currently 
enrolled in the study. 
9.1.4 Data Protection  
• Participants will be assigned a unique identifier by the Sponsor. Any participant records or 
datasets that are transferred to the Sponsor will contain the identifier only; participant names 
or an y information which would make the participant identi fiable will not be transferred.  
• The participant must be informed that his/her personal study- related data will be used by the 
Sponsor in accordance with local data protection law. The level of disclosure must also b e 
explained to the participant. 
• The participant must be informed that his/her medical records may be examined by Clinical Quality Assurance auditors or other authorized personnel appointed by the Sponsor, by appropriate IRB/IEC members, and by inspectors from regulatory authorities. 
9.1.5 Data Quality Assurance  
• All participant data relating to the study will be recorded on printed or eCRF s unless 
transmitted to the Sponsor or designee electronically ( e.g., laboratory data). The Investigator 
is responsible for verifying that data entries are accurate and correct by physically or 
electronically signing the e CRF.  
• The Investigator must maintain accurate documentation (source data) that supports the 
information entered in the e CRF.  
• The Investigator m ust permit study -related monitoring, audits, IRB/IEC review, and 
regulatory agency inspections and provide direct a ccess to source data documents.

6 January  2020  33 of 54 V2.0 • The Sponsor or designee is responsible for the data management of this study including 
quality checking of the data.  
• Study monitors will perform ongoing source data verification to confirm that data entered 
into the eCRF by authorized site personnel are accurate, complete, and verifiable from source 
documents; that the safety and rights of participants are being protected; and that the study is 
being conducted in accordance with the currently approved protocol and any other study agreements, ICH GCP, and all appl icable regulatory requirements.  
• Records and documents, including signed ICF, pertaining to the conduct of this study must be retained by the Investigator for 5 years after study completion unless local regulations or 
institutional policies require a longer retention period. No records may be destroyed during the retention period without the written approval of the Sponsor. No records may be transferred to another location or party without written notification to the Sponsor. 
• All data generated by the site personnel will be captured electronically at each study center using e CRFs. Data from external sources ( such as laboratory data) will be imported into the 
database. Once the eCRF clinical data have been submitted to the central server at the 
independent data center, corrections to the data fields will be captured in an audit trail. The 
reason for change, the name of the person who performed the change, together with the time 
and date will be logged to provide an audit trail. 
• If additional corrections are needed, the responsible monitor or data manager will raise a query in the electronic data capture (EDC) ap plication. The appropriate staff at the study site 
will answer queries sent to the Investigator. The name of the staff member responding to the 
query, and time and date stamp will be captured to provide an audit trail. Once all source data 
verification is complete and all queries are closed, the monitor will lock the database.

The Sponsor designee reserves the right to close the study site or terminate the study at any time 
for any reason at the sole discretion of the Sponsor. Study sites will be closed upon study 
completion. A study site is considered closed when all required documents and study supplies have been collected and a study  site closure visit has been performed. 
The Investigator may initiate study  site closure at any time, provided there is reasonable cause 
and sufficient notice is given in advance of the intended termination. 
Reasons for the early closure of a study site by the Sponsor or Investigator may include but are 
not limited to:  
• Failure of the Investigator to comply with the protocol, the requirements of the IRB/IEC or 
local health authorities, the Sponsor's procedures, or GCP guidelines. 
• Inadequate recruitment of participants by the Investigator . 
• Discontinuation of further study treatment  development . 
9.1.8 Publication Policy

amendment(s) will be submitted to the US Investigational N ew Drug (IND) under which th e 
study is being conducted. 
Administrative changes (not affecting the participant  benefit/risk ratio) may be made without the 
need for a formal amendment. All amendments will be distributed to all protocol recipients, with 
appropriate instructions. 
9.1.10  Liabili ty and Insurance  
The Sponsor will take out reasonable third- party liability insurance cover in accordance with all 
local legal requirements. The civil liability of the Investigator, the persons instructed by him or her and the hospital, practice, or institute in which they are employed and the liability of the Sponsor with respect to financial loss due to personal injury and other damage that may arise as a result of the carrying out of this study are governed by the applicable law. 
The Sponsor will a rrange for participant s participating in this study to be insured against 
financial loss due to personal injury caused by the pharmaceutical products being tested or by 
medical steps taken in the course of the study.  
9.1.10.1  Access to Source Data  
During the study, a monitor will make site visits to review protocol compliance, compare EDC/eCRF entries and individual participant ’s medical records, assess drug accountability, and 
ensure that the study is being conducted according to pertinent regulatory requirements. The 
EDC/eCRF entries will be verified with source documentation. The review of medical records will be performed in a manner to ensure that participant confidentiality is maintained.  
Checking of the EDC/eCRF entries for completeness and clarity, and cross -checking with source 
documents, will be required to monitor the progress of the study. Moreover, regulatory 
authorities of certain countries, IRBs, IECs, and/or the Sponsor’ s Clinical Quality Assurance 
Group may wish to carry out such source data checks and/or on- site audit inspections. Direct 
access to source data will be required for these inspections and audits; they will be carried out 
giving due consideration to data protection and medical confidentiality. The Investigator assures 
the CRO and the Sponsor of the necessary support at all times.

6 January  2020  37 of 54 V2.0 9.3 Appendix  3: Adverse Events: Definitions and Procedures for Recording, 
Evaluating, Follow- up, and Reporting  
Definition of AE  
AE Definition  
• An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant  or clinical study 
participant, temporally associated with the use of a study treatment, whether or not 
considered related to the medicinal product. 
• NOTE: An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an 
abnormal laboratory finding) , symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally 
associated with the use of a study treatment . 
 
Events Meeting  the AE Definition  
• Any abnormal laboratory test results (hematology, clinical chemistry, or urinalysis) or other safety assessments ( e.g., ECG, radiological scans, vital signs measurements), 
including those that worsen from baseline, considered clinically significant in the medical and scientific judgment of the Investigator (i.e., not related to progression of 
underlying disease). 
• Exacerbat ion of a chronic or intermittent pre-existing condition including either an 
increase in frequency and/or intensity of the condition. 
• New conditions detected or diagnosed after study treatment  administration even 
though it may have been present before the s tart of the study.  
• Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected drug-drug interaction. 
• Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study treatment  or a concomitant medication. Overdose per se will not be reported as an 
AE/SAE unless it is an intentional overdose taken with possible suicidal/self -harming 
intent. Such overdoses should be reported regardless of sequelae. 
• "Lack of efficacy" or "failure of expected pharmacological action" per se will not be 
reported as  an AE or SAE. Such instances will be captured in the efficacy 
assessments. However, the signs, symptoms, and/or clinical sequelae resulting from 
lack of efficacy will be reported as an AE or SAE if they fulfil l the definition of an 
AE or SAE.  
 
Apnimed, Inc.  Clinical Study Protocol  
Protocol APC -004/IND 141505 CONFIDENTIAL  
 
6 January  2020  38 of 54 V2.0 Events NOT  Meeting the AE Definition  
• Any clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings or other abnormal safety 
assessments which are associated with the underlying disease, unless judged by the Investigator to be more severe than expected for the participant ’s condition. 
• The disease/disorder being studied or expected progression, signs, or symptoms of the disease/disorder being studied, unless more severe than expected for the participant’ s 
condition. 
• Medical or surgical procedure (e.g., endoscopy, appendectomy): the condition that leads to the procedure is the AE. 
• Situations in which an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or convenience admission to a hospital). 
• Anticipated day- to-day fluctuations of pre- existing disease(s) or con dition(s) present 
or detected at the start of the study that do not worsen. 
 
Definition of SAE  
If an event is not an AE per definition above, then it cannot be an SAE even if serious conditions 
are met ( e.g., hospitalization for signs/symptoms of the disease under study, death due to 
progression of disease). 
An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose:  
Results in death  
Is life -threatening  
The term 'life -threatening' in the definition of 'serious' refers to an event in which the 
participant was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an event, which hypothetically might have caused death, if it were more severe.  
Apnimed, Inc.  Clinical Study Protocol  
Protocol APC -004/IND 141505 CONFIDENTIAL  
 
6 January  2020  39 of 54 V2.0 Requires inpatient  hospitalization or p rolongation of existing hospitalization  
In general, hospitalization signifies that the participant has been detained (usually 
involving at least an overnight stay) at the hospital or emergency ward for observation 
and/or treatment that would not have been appropriate in the physician ’s office or 
outpatient setting. Complications that occur during hospitalization are AE. If a 
complication prolongs hospitalization or fulfills any other serious criteria, the event is serious. When in doubt as to whether “hospi talization ” occurred or was necessary, the AE 
should be considered serious. 
Hospitalization for elective treatment of a pre -existing condition that did not worsen from 
baseline is not considered an AE. 
Results in persistent disability/incapacity  
• The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct 
normal life functions. 
• This definition is not intended to include experiences of relatively minor medical 
significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, in fluenza, 
and accidental trauma ( e.g., sprained ankle) which may interfere with or prevent 
everyday life functions but do not constitute a substantial disruption. 
Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
Other situations  
• Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether SAE reporting is appropriate in other situations such as important medical events that may not be immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may 
jeopardize the participant or may require medical or surgical treatment  to prevent one 
of the other outcomes listed in the above definition. These events should usually be considered serious. 
Examples of such events include invasive or malignant cancers, intensive treatment in an 
emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias, or convulsions 
that do not result in hospitalization, or development of drug dependency or drug abuse.

6 January  2020  40 of 54 V2.0 Recording and Follow- up of AE and SAE  
AE and SAE Recording  
• When an AE/SAE occurs, it is the responsibility of the I nvestigator to review all 
documentation (e.g., hospital progress notes, laboratory, and diagnostics reports) 
related to the event.  
• The Investigator will then record all relevant AE/SAE information in the eCRF.  
• It is not acceptable for the Investigator to send photocopies of the participant’ s 
medical records in lieu of completion of the AE/SAE eCRF page. 
• There may be instances when copies of medical records for certain cases are requested  by the CRO . In this case, all participant identifiers, with the exception of 
the participant number, will be blinded on the copies of the medical records before submission to the CRO . 
• The I nvestigator will attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on signs, 
symptoms, and/or other clinical information. In such cases, the diagnosis (not the individual signs/symptoms) will be documented as the AE/SAE.  
Assessment of Intensity  
The I nvestigator will make an assessment of intensity for each AE and SAE reported 
during the study and assign it to one of the following categories: 
• Mild: An event that is easily tolerated by the participant, causing minimal discomfort and not interfering with everyday activities.  
• Moderate: An event that causes sufficient discomfort and interferes with normal everyday activities.  
• Severe: An event that prevents normal everyday activities. An AE that is assessed as severe should not be confused with an SAE. Severe is a category utilized for rating the intensity of an event; and both AE and SAE can be assessed as severe.  
An event is defined as ‘serious ’ when it meets at least one of the predefined outcomes as 
described in the definition of an SAE, NOT when it is rated as severe.

Protocol APC -004/IND 141505 CONFIDENTIAL  
 
6 January  2020  41 of 54 V2.0 Assessment of Causality  
• The I nvestigator is obligated to assess the relationship between study treatment  and 
each occurrence of each AE/SAE.  
• A "reasonable possibility" of a relationship conveys that there are facts, evidence, 
and/or arguments to suggest a causal relationship, rather than a relationship cannot be ruled out. 
• The I nvestigator will use clinical judgment to determine the relationship.  
• Alternative causes, such as underlying disease(s), concomitant therapy, and other risk factors, as well as the temporal relationship of the e vent to study treatment  
administration will be considered and investigated. 
• The I nvestigator will also consult the Investigator ’s Brochure and/or Product 
Information, for marketed products, in his/her assessment. 
• For each AE/SAE, the I nvestigator must  document in the medical notes that he/she 
has reviewed the AE/SAE and has provided an assessment of causality. 
• There may be situations in which an SAE has occurred and the I nvestigator has 
minimal information to include in the initial report to the CRO . However, it is very 
important that the I nvestigator always make an assessment of causality for every 
event before the initial transmission of the SAE data to the CRO . 
• The I nvestigator may change his/her opinion of causality in light of follow-up 
informat ion and send an SAE follow-up report with the updated causality assessment. 
• The causality assessment is one of the criteria used when determining regulatory reporting requirements.
 
 
Follow -up of AE and SAE  
• The I nvestigator is obligated to perform or arrange for the conduct of supplemental 
measurements and/or evaluations as medically indicated or as requested by the CRO  
to elucidate the nature and/or causality of the AE or SAE as fully as possible. This may include additional laboratory tests or investigations, histopathological 
examinations, or consultation with other health care professionals. 
• If a participant dies during participation in the study , the I nvestigator will provide the 
CRO  with a copy of any post-mortem findings including histopathology. 
Apnimed, Inc.  Clinical Study Protocol  
Protocol APC -004/IND 141505 CONFIDENTIAL  
 
6 January  2020  42 of 54 V2.0 • New or updated information will be recorded in the originally completed eCRF.  
• The I nvestigator will submit any updated SAE data to the CRO within 24 hours of 
receipt of the information.  
 
Reporting of SAE to CRO  
SAE Reporting to CRO  
Via EDC Tool 
• The Investigator must report any SAEs to the CRO  within 24 hours of becoming 
aware of the event.  
• When calling to report an SAE, state that you are reporting an SAE and give the 
Investigator’s name, your name, the telephone number where you can be reached, and the protocol number and title. 
• The Investigator and the Sponsor (or Sponsor’ s designated agent) will review each 
SAE report and the Sponsor/ CRO  will evaluate the seriousness and the causal 
relationship of the event to study treatment. In addition, the Sponsor (or Sponsor’ s 
designated agent) will evaluate the expectedness according to the reference documents (Investigator’s Brochure or US product labeling for atomoxetine or 
oxybutynin). Based on the Investigator and Sponsor’ s assessment of the event, a 
decision will be made concerning the need for further action . 
• After the study is completed at a given site, the electronic data collection tool will be taken off-line to prevent the entry of new data or changes to existing data. 
• If a site receives a report of a new SAE from a study participant or receives updated 
data on a previously reported SAE after the electronic data collection tool has been 
taken off-line, then the site can report this information on a paper SAE form or by telephone. 
• Contacts for SAE reporting can be found in the Study Reference Manual.  
 
All SAEs will be recorded from signing of informed consent until the end of the study. Serious 
adverse events occurring after the end of the study and coming to the attention of the Investigator must b e reported only if they are considered (in the opinion of the Investigator) causally- related 
to study treatment .

Protocol APC -004/IND 141505 CONFIDENTIAL  
 
6 January  2020  43 of 54 V2.0  
Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions (SUSARs)  
Any AE that is serious, associated with the use of the study treatment , and unexpected 
(SUSAR) has additional reporting requirements, as described below. 
• If the SUSAR is fatal or life -threatening, associated with study treatment , and 
unexpected, regulatory authorities and IECs will be notified within 7 calendar days 
after th e Sponsor learns of the event. Additional follow -up (cause of death, autopsy 
report, and hospital report) information should be reported within an additional 8 days 
(15 days total). 
• If the SUSAR is not fatal or life -threatening but is otherwise serious, associated with 
study treatment, and unexpected, regulatory a uthorities and IECs will be notified 
within 15 calendar days after the Sponsor learns of the event. 
The Sponsor will notify the Investigators in a timely fashion of relevant information about SUSARs that could adversely affect the safety of participants.  Follow-up 
information may be submitted if necessary.  
The Sponsor will also provide annual safety updates to the regulatory authori ties and 
IECs responsible for the study. These updates will include information on SUSARs and other relevant safety findings.  
Reporting Serious Adverse Events  
The Investigator must report any SAEs to the CRO  within 24 hours of becoming aware of the 
event. 
When calling to report an SAE, state that you are reporting an SAE and give the Investigator ’s 
name, your name, the telephone number where you can be reached, and the protocol number and 
title. 
The Investigator and the Sponsor (or Sponsor’ s designated agent) will review each SAE report 
and the Sponsor/ CRO  will evaluate the seriousness and the causal relationship of the event to 
study treatment. In addition, the Sponsor (or Sponsor’ s designated agent) will evaluate the 
expectedness according to the reference document s (Investigator’s Brochure or US product 
labeling for atomoxetine or oxybutynin). Based on the Investigator and Sponsor’ s assessment of 
the event, a decision will be made concerning the need for further action.

Information  
Definitions  
WOCBP  
A woman is considered fertile following menarche and until becoming post-menopausal unless 
permanently sterile (see below).  
Women in the following categories are not considered WOCBP: 
1. Premenarchal  
2. Premenopausal female with one of the following: 
• Docum ented hysterectomy  
• Documented bilateral salpingectomy  
• Documented bilateral oophorectomy 
NOTE: Documentation can come from the site personnel’ s review of the participant ’s medical 
records, medical examination, or medical history interview. 
3. Post-menopausal female  
• A post-menopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 months without an alternative medical cause. A high follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) level in the post-menopausal range may be used to confirm a post-menopausal state in women not using hormonal contraception or hormonal replacement therapy (HRT). However, in the absence of 12 months of amenorrhea, a single FSH measurement is insufficient. 
• Females on HRT  and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one 
of the non-estrogen hormonal highly effective contraception methods if they wish to continue their HRT during the study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of post-menopausal status before study enrollment. 
Contraception Guidance:  
Male Participants:  
Male participants with female partners of childbearing potential are eligible to participate if the agree to ONE of the following during the protocol- defined time frame:

6 January  2020  45 of 54 V2.0 • Are abstinent from penile- vaginal intercourse as their usual and preferred lifestyle 
(abstinent on a long- term and persistent basis) and agree to remain abstinent.  
• Agree to use a contraceptive method with a fail ure rate of <1% per year as described 
in the table below when having penile-vaginal intercourse with a WOCBP who is not 
currently p regnant. 
In addition, male participants must refrain from donating sperm for the duration of the study and 
for 3 months after the last dose of study treatment . 
Male participants with a pregnant or breastfeeding partner must agree to remain abstinent from penile -vaginal intercourse or to use a male condom during each episode of penile penetration 
during the protocol- defined time frame.  
Female Participants  
Female participants of childbearing potential are eligible to participate if they agree to use a 
highly effective method of contraception consistently and correctly as described in the table below.

Highly Effective Contraceptive Methods That Are User Independent1 
Implantable progestogen -only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation 
• IUD 
• Intrauterine hormone- releasing system (IUS)  
• Bilateral tubal occlusion  
Vasectomized partner  
A vasectomized partner is a highly effective contraception method provided that the partner is 
the sole male sexual partner of the WOCBP and the absence of sperm has been confirmed. If not, an additional highly effective method of contraception should be used. 
Sexual abstinence  
Sexual abst inence is considered a highly effective method only if defined as refraining from 
heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the study treatment. The reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the d uration of the study and 
the preferred and usual lifestyle of the participant. 
NOTES:  
1 Typical use failure rates may differ from those when used consistently and correctly. Use should be consistent with 
local regulations regarding the use of contraceptiv e methods for participants participating in clinical studies.  
 
 
Pregnancy Testing  
• WOCBP should only be included after a confirmed menstrual period and a negative highly 
sensitive serum pregnancy test.  
• An additional serum  pregnancy testing should be perform ed at Visit 5 (EOS). 
Apnimed, Inc.  Clinical Study Protocol  
Protocol APC -004/IND 141505 CONFIDENTIAL  
 
6 January  2020  47 of 54 V2.0 • Pregnancy testing will be performed whenever a menstrual cycle is missed or when 
pregnancy is otherwise suspected. 
Collection of Pregnancy Information: 
Female participants who become pregnant  
• The Investigator will collect pregnancy information on any female participant who becomes 
pregnant while participating in this study. Information will be recorded on the appropriate form and submitted to the Sponsor within 24 hours  of learning of a participant ’s pregnancy. 
The participant will be followed to determine the outcome of the pregnancy. The Investigator 
will collect any follow up information on the participant and the neonate and the information will be forwarded to the Sponsor. Generally, follow up will not be required for longer than 6 to 8 weeks beyond the estimated delivery date. Any termination of the pregnancy will be 
reported, regardless of fetal state (presence or absence of anomalies) or indication for the 
procedure. 
• While pregnancy itself is not considered to be an AE or SAE, any pregnancy complication or elective termination of a pregnancy will be reported as an AE or SAE. A spontaneous abortion is always considered to be an SAE and will be reported as such. Any post- study 
pregnancy- related SAE considered re asonably related to the study treatment by the 
Investigator will be reported to the Sponsor. While the Investigator is not obligated to actively seek this information in former study participants, he or she may learn of an SAE through spontaneous reporting. 
• Any female participant who becomes pregnant while participating in the study will be withdrawn from the study.

Section  Action  Text Rationale for 
Change 
Revisions in Version 1.1  
Section 1.2 SoA  Removed  AE/SAE monitoring 
removed from V1 and V2  AE/SAE 
monitoring begins 
with randomization; prior to that 
record as medical 
history 
Section 1.2 
Footnote 4 Changed  From  
“A PSG conducted by the study site within 6 
months that meets PSG 
enrollment criteria can take the place of a 
screening PSG ” 
To 
“Only patients who meet 
all non- PSG enrollment 
criteria at Visit 1 are 
eligible for a screening PSG” Current PSG will 
be required to establish 
consistent 
baseline for all patients  
Section 4.1 
Overall Design  Removed  “A prior full night PSG 
conducted by the study 
site within 6 months of 
Visit 1 that meets PSG enrollment criteria can Current PSG will 
be required to 
establish 
consistent baseline for all 
patients

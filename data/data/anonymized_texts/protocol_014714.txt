CONFIDENTIAL    Protocol Synopsis 
Title:   A Double- blind, Randomized, Placebo- Controlled, Multicenter Study to Evaluate Safety 
and Efficacy of Evolocumab (AMG 145) in Combination With Statin Therapy in Diabetic Subjects 
With Hyperlipidemia or Mixed Dyslipidemia  
Study Phase:  3 
Indication:   Hyperlipidemia or mixed dyslipidemia  
Primary Objective:   To evaluate the effect of 12 weeks of subcutaneous (SC) evolocumab every 
2 weeks (Q2W) and monthly (QM) , in combination with oral (PO) atorvastatin daily (QD), 
compared with placebo Q2W and QM, in combination with PO atorvastatin QD, on percent 
change from baseline in low -density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL- C) in diabetic subjects with 
hyperlipidemia or mixed dyslipidemia.  
Secondary Objective(s):  
• to evaluate the safety and tolerability of SC evolocumab Q2W and QM in combination with 
atorvastatin QD, compared with placebo Q2W and QM, in combination with atorvastatin QD, 
in diabetic subjects with hyperlipidemia or mixed dyslipidemia  
• to assess the effects of 12 weeks of SC evolocumab Q2W and QM in combination with 
atorvastatin QD, compared with placebo Q2W and QM, in combination with atorvastatin QD, 
on change from baseline in LDL- C, and percent change from baseline in non -high-density 
lipoprotein cholesterol (non -HDL-C), apolipoprotein B 100 (ApoB 100), total cholesterol, total 
cholesterol/HDL- C ratio, ApoB 100/Apolipoprotein A -1 (ApoA1) ratio, lipoprotein(a) [ Lp(a)], 
triglycerides, very low -density lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL- C), and HDL- C in diabetic 
subjects with hyperlipidemia or mixed dyslipidemia  
• to assess the effects of 12 weeks of SC evolocumab Q2W and QM in combination with 
atorvastatin QD, compared with placebo Q2W and QM, in combination with atorvastatin QD, 
on percent of subjects attaining LDL- C < 70 mg/dL (1.8 mmol/L) in diabetic subjects with 
hyperlipidemia or mixed dyslipidemia  
Hypotheses:   The primary hypothesis is that both dosing regimens  of SC evolocumab (140 mg 
Q2W and 420 mg QM) in combination with atorvastatin QD will be well tolerated and will result in 
greater reduction of LDL-C, defined as mean percent change from baseline at weeks 10 and 
12 and percent change from baseline at week 12, compared with placebo (Q2W and QM) , in 
combination with atorvastatin QD in diabetic subjects with hyperlipidemia or mixed dyslipidemia.  
Co-primary Efficacy Endpoints:    
• m ean percent change from baseline in LDL- C at weeks 10 and 12  
• percent change from baseline in LDL- C at week 12 
Co-Secondary Efficacy Endpoints:  
Co-secondary efficacy endpoints are (1) the mean of weeks 10 and 12 and (2) week 12 for: 
Tier 1  
• change from baseline in LDL-C  
• percent change from baseline in non -HDL-C  
• percent change from baseline in ApoB 100 
• percent change from baseline in the total cholesterol  
• percent change from baseline in the total cholesterol/HDL- C ratio  
• percent change from baseline in ApoB 100/ApoA1 ratio  
• achievement of target LDL -C < 70 mg/dL (1.8 mmol/L)

CONFIDENTIAL  Tier 2  
•percent change from baseline in Lp(a)
•percent change from baseline in triglycerides
•percent change from baseline in HDL-C
•percent change from baseline in VLDL -C
Safety Endpoints  
•subject incidence of treatment emergent adverse events

Study Design:   This is a phase 3, multicenter, double- blind, randomize d, stratified, 
placebo -controlled study of evolocumab for diabetic subjects with hyperlipidemia or mixed 
dyslipidemia .  Subjects  will undergo screening procedures, including laboratory assessments and 
a screening placebo  injection , and will enter a lipid stabilization period where they will receive 
20 mg atorvastatin daily (QD).  Upon ≥  4 weeks lipid stabilizatio n, subjects will be randomized 
2:2:1:1  into the following treatment arms:   
•Evolocumab SC 140 mg Q2W and atorvastatin PO 20 mg QD ,
•Evolocumab SC 420 mg QM and atorvastatin PO 20 mg QD ,
•placebo SC  Q2W and atorvastatin PO 20 mg QD,  or
•placebo SC QM and atorvastatin PO 20 mg QD .
The sample size for each of the evolocumab dosing regimens, in combination with atorvastatin, 
will be approximately 300 subjects.  The sample size for each of the placebo dosing regimens, in 
combination with atorvastatin, will be approximately 150 subjects .  Randomization will be 
stratified by entry statin therapy (no statin use vs non- intensive statin use vs intensive statin use 
[see Appendix  D of the protocol] ) and by the site’s geographic region.  Treatment  and follow -up 
period will be 12 weeks with an additional phone call or other subject contact at week 14 for 
subjects receiving IP Q2W.  
Evolocumab and placebo SC will be adminis tered at th e study site or appropriate non- investigator  
site settings , eg, at the subject’s home, per protocol Section  6 and Section 7 by spring -based 
prefilled autoi njector/pen (prefilled AI/Pen)  for subjects receiving IP Q2W and by 3.5 mL Personal 
Injector for subjects receiving IP QM.  The dose frequencies of Q2W and QM will not be blinded 
but the identity of IP ( evolocumab and matching SC placebo) will be blinded.  Post-IP treatment 
central laboratory results of the lipid panel, ApoA1, ApoB 100, ApoB48, free fatty acids, 
chylomicrons, lipoprotein(a), PCSK9, insulin, proinsulin, C -peptide, glucagon, IL- 6, adiponectin, 
vitamin E, PK, and high sensitivity C -reactive pro tein (hsCRP) will be blinded until unblinding of 
the clinical database and will not be reported to the investigator post -screening.  Inves tigators 
should not perform non- protocol testing of these analytes during a subject’s study part icipation 
and until at  least 12 weeks after last IP administration, or the subject’s end of study, whichever is 
later.  
The study includes collection of biomarker samples and, where approved by the institutional review board and/or independent ethics committee (IRB/IEC) and appl icable regulatory and other 
authorities, subjects will be invited to consent to pharmacogenetics analyses.  All subjects will 
complete a mixed meal  tolerance test (MMTT) at the day 1 and week 12 study visits with 
1 postprandial blood collection 2 hours after the meal and up to approximately 240 subjects will 
participate in a MMTT Extended Timepoints Substudy with 2 additional postprandial blood draws 
at 1  and 3 hours after the meal.  End of study  (EOS) for subjects on QM  IP is at the week 12

CONFIDENTIAL  visit.  EOS fo r subjects on Q2W IP is by contact (eg,  phone call) from the site at week 14 for any 
potential adverse events ( AEs), adverse device effects (ADEs), and serious AEs ( SAEs ).  
Subjects will be encouraged to complete all planned visits regardless  of their adherence to IP 
administration.  Accumulating safety and other data will be reviewed by an independent external 
Data Monitoring Committee (DMC).  Concentration values are provided in mmol/L for investigator 
convenience.   Conventional concentrations (mg/mL) will be used for the protocol, including for 
eligibility determination.

Investigational Product  
Amgen Investigational Product Dosage and Administration:   Evolocumab and placebo SC 
will be administered using a spring -based prefilled AI/Pen or by 3.5 mL Personal Injector .  Each 
prefilled AI/Pen will contain 1.0 mL deliverable volume; each Personal Injector will contain 3.5 mL 
deliverable volume. 
Evolocumab will be administered at 1 of 2 regimens:  
Evolocumab 140 mg SC Q2W  by prefilled AI/Pen or 
Evolocumab 420 mg SC QM  by 3.5 mL Personal Injector  
Placebo will be administered at 1 of 2 regimens:  
Placebo SC Q2W by prefilled AI/Pen or  
Placebo SC QM by 3.5 mL Personal Injector . 
Non- Amgen Non-i nvestigational Product Dosage and Administration:   Atorvastatin 20 mg 
will be provided by Amgen . 
Procedures:   Subjects who have signed informed consent will undergo screening procedures 
including laboratory assessments  and a 1-time administration of placebo by AI/Pen  and will enter 
a lipid stabilization period where they will receive 20 mg atorvastatin daily (QD) .  Subjects should 
maintain their diet, any allowed therapy, and exercise regimen throughout screening and study 
participation.  Eligible subjects will be scheduled to return to the study site after ≥ 4 weeks of lipid 
stabilization to initiate IP administration and other day 1 procedures.  For randomization, the site 
Product:  Evolocumab  
Protocol Number:  20120119  
Date:  11 November 2015  Page 6 of 90 
CONFIDENTIAL  will contact the interactive voice response system or interactive web response system 
(IVRS/IWRS).  Day 1 is defined as the day of first administration of IP  and should occur as close 
as possible or on the day of randomization but not later than 5 days after randomization.  Subsequent mandatory study visits are at week s 2, 8, 1 0, and 12 (EOS for QM subjects).  In 
addition, subjects receiving IP Q2W will be contacted (eg, by phone call) by the study site at week  14 (EOS for Q2W subjects) to obtain AE , ADE , and SAE information, if applicable.  For 
subjects randomized to receive IP Q2W, IP will be administered by AI/Pen at the study site on day 1, and week s 2, 8, and 10.  For subjects randomized to receive IP QM, IP will be 
administered by  3.5 mL Personal Injector  at the study site on day 1, and week 8.  For other 
administrations of IP by AI/Pen  or 3.5 mL Personal Injector, respectively, subjects will have the 
option of self-administratio n, defined as SC administration of IP by the subject, designee or a 
qualified health care professional in a non- investigator site setting (eg, at home).  The subject 
(or designee, if not a qualified healthcare professional) must have demonstrated competenc y at 
administration of SC injections before self- administration is permitted: the first self- administered 
dose by the subject (or designee, if not a healthcare professional) must be administered at the site under the supervision of a healthcare provider.  Final administration of IP ( evolocumab or 
placebo) is at week 8 for QM treatment and week  10 for Q2W treatment.  Subjects who 
discontinue IP for any reason will be asked to continue to return for all other study procedures and measurements until the end of  the study . 
Vital signs, AEs /ADEs/ SAEs, concomitant therapy, evaluation of fasting lipids , dietary instruction, 
physical exam, measuring waist circumference, body height and weight, 12- lead ECGs, other 
laboratory assessments, including assessment for anti -evolocumab antibodies, biomarker sample 
collection, serum pregnancy testing (females of childbearing potential), MMTT , urinalysis , and 
steroid analyte testing will be carried out per the Schedule of Assessment (Table 1) of the 
protocol .  If the subject consented to pharmacogenetics analyses, deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA ) 
will be extracted from some of the blood samples.  IP administration by SC injection, if applicable, will be done after other procedures have been completed .   
For a full list of study procedures, including the timing of each procedure, please refer to Section  7 and the Schedule of Assessments  (Table  1).   
Statistica l Considerations:  
General Considerations  
Efficacy and safety analyses will be performed on the full analysis set (FAS), which includes all randomized subjects who have received at least 1 dose of IP.  Analyses will be performed separately by dose frequen cy (Q2W and QM)  unless specified otherwise.  Methods of adjusting 
for multiplicity due to testing the superiority of evolocumab in combination with atorvastatin to 
placebo in combination with atorvastatin for both the co- primary and co -secondary efficacy 
endpoints within each dose frequency  are provided in Section  10.5.   Subject incidence of 
exploratory endpoint events will be summarized for each treatment group.  
Analyses of Co- Primary Efficacy Endpoints  
To assess the co- primary  efficacy endpoints of the mean percent change from baseline at weeks 
10 and 12 and percent change from baseline at week 12 in LDL- C, a repeated measures linear 
effects model will be used in each dose frequency to compare the efficacy of evolocumab in 
comb ination with atorvastatin and placebo in combination with atorvastatin.  The repeated 
measures model will include terms for treatment group, stratification factors, scheduled visit and the interaction of treatment with scheduled visit.  Missing values will  not be imputed when the 
repeated measures linear effects model is used.  
Analyses of Co- Secondary Efficacy Endpoints  
The statistical model for the co- secondary efficacy endpoints will be similar to the co- primary 
efficacy endpoints. However, the co -secondary efficacy endpoints of LDL- C target achievement 
will be analyzed using the C ochran -Mantel -Haenszel (CMH) test adjusted by the stratification 
factors .

CONFIDENTIAL  Safety Analyses  
AEs will be coded using the current version of MedDRA.  Subject incidence of 
treatment -emergent adverse events, serious adverse events, and adverse events leading to 
discontinuation of IP will be tabulated by system organ class and preferred term by randomized 
treatment group.   
Measurements of laboratory parameters, ECGs, and vital signs will be summarized over time. Lab shift tables will be provided.  The incidence and percentages of subjects who develop anti-evolocumab antibodies (binding and neutralizing) at any time will be tabulated.  
Safety Monitoring  
An independent DMC will formally review the accumulating data from this and other completed and ongoing studies with evolocumab to ensure there is no avoidable increased risk for harm to 
subjects.  Analyses for the DMC will be provided by a group which is external to Amgen.  
For a full description of statistical analysis methods, please refer to Section 10.

2. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
2.1 Cardiovascular Disease and Diabetes 
Collectively, cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are regarded as a world-wide epidemic; and 
although CVD mortality has declined (primarily in developed countries)  over the last two 
decades , it still represents the leading cause of death and disability in the world, as well 
as over 10% of the global total disease burden.  In 2008, the WHO estimated 57 million 
deaths world-wide, of which 36 million were due to non-communicable causes.  CVD 
accounted for over 17 million of these deaths, nearly 80% of which were due to heart 
attacks and strokes alone (responsible for 7.3 million and 6.2 million deaths, respectively). 
The facts below illustrate the magnitude of the problem in the US (Roger et al, 2011): 
 (i) In excess of one in three individuals in the US has some form of CVD. Coronary 
heart disease (CHD) affects almost 17 million Americans. Of those almost 8 million 
suffer from myocardial infarction; nearly 10 million from angina pectoris; nearly 6 million from heart failure; and 6 to 7 million from stroke.  The aging of the population and the 
explosive increase in the prevalence of obesity and type 2 diabetes and their related 
complicati ons (hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and atherosclerotic vascular disease) will 
only serve to increase the prevalence of CVD. 
(ii) CVD claims more lives each year than cancer, chronic lower respiratory disease, and 
accidents combined. Over 2200 Americans die  of CVD each day .  Mortality data show 
that CVD accounted for more than one in three deaths (over 800,000) in the United States.  Since 1900, CVD has been the number 1 killer in the United States every year, 
with the exception of 1 year only (1918). 
(iii) CHD caused approximately 1 of every 6 deaths in the United States.  CHD mortality 
was slightly more than 400,000.  It is estimated that each year 785,000 and 
470,000 Americans will have a new and recurrent acute coronary syndrome,

CONFIDENTIAL    respectively.  An additional 195,000 silent first myocardial infarctions are estimated to 
occur each year . 
(iv) Approximately 795,000 people experience a new or recurrent stroke each year. 
About 610,000 of these are first attacks, and 185,000 are recurrent attacks.  Preliminary 
data from 2006 indicate that stroke accounted for about 1 of every 18 deaths in the United States. 
The situation in the European Union (EU) is similar.  CHD by itself remains the single 
most common cause of deaths in the EU (Allender et al, 2008).  Each year CVD causes 
over 4.3 million deaths in Europe and over 2.0 million deaths in the EU.  CVD causes 
nearly half of all deaths in Europe (48%) and in the EU (42%). CVD remains a significant cause of morbidity in non-Western regions as well.  For 
example, i n Ch ina, heart attacks and strokes account for the number 1 and 3 causes of 
death among men and women combined, respectively ( He et al, 2005).  China now 
ranks among the top 10 countries in the world for total incidence of CVD, thus 
representing a significant and growing public health problem ( Liu et al, 2007).  Similar 
trends  have been noted in other Asian countries , India, and Braz il (Iso, 2011; 
Celermajer  et al, 2012; Mansur et al, 2010).  These trends are thought to result from 
growing urbanization and industrialization which  has resulted in a rise in cardiovascular 
risk factors such as glucose intolerance, dyslipidemia, and hypertension (Ueshima et al, 2008; Khoo, 2003). Importantly, elevated blood glucose has been 
estimated to contribute to 22% of coronary heart disease deaths and 16% of stroke 
deaths (World Health Organization, 2009). 
Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a major independent risk fact or for cardiovascular 
disease-coronary heart disease (CHD) and stroke – and conditions such as 
hypertension and dysl ipidemia frequently coexist with diabetes ( American Diabetes 
Association, 2005).  Most diabetic patients have an approximately 2-fold increased level 
of cardiovascular risk compared to nondiabetics , even when established CHD is absent. 
Patients with type 2 diabetes  also have an increased prevalence of lipid abnormalities 
contributing to the increased risk of cardiovascular disease ( Arca 2007).  Therefore, 
treatment guidelines recommend aggressive lipid treatment goals for patients with 
diabetes (eg,  Brunzell et al, 2008; Grundy et al, 2004; Reiner et al, 2011; Chinese 
Society of Cardiology, 2011).

CONFIDENTIAL    A direct correlation between dyslipidemia and cardiovascular -related deaths has been 
demonstrated across several global regions ( Menotti et al, 2008; Imano et al , 2011; 
Yang et al, 2012).  Because dyslipidemia is a major modifiable risk for the development 
of CVD, therapies for hyperlipidemia/dyslipidemia can translate into an opportunity for 
significantly reducing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality throughout different populations and w orld regions . 
2.2 Current Therapies for Reducing the Risk of Cardiovascular Disease 
Events 
Extensive clinical trial data in both primary and secondary prevention demonstrate that 
the reduction in total cholesterol, non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol  (HDL -C), and 
most importantly, LDL-C, through pharmacological therapies, lowers the risk of CVD 
events (Kannel et al, 1974; Kannel, 1995; Kannel et al, 1979). To decrease the burden 
of CVD, over 50 million patients in the United States, Europe, and Asia are currently treated with dyslipidemia therapies ( World Health Organization, 2011). 
Statins ( 3-hydroxy -3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors) are currently the 
treatment of choice for hypercholesterolemia ( Chinese Society of Cardiology, 2011; 
Teramoto et al, 2007; Grundy et al, 2004; Reiner et al, 2011). As in other  regions of the 
world, in Asian countries  higher potency statin use has  been associated with lower 
LDL-C levels and higher proportions of patients achieving their LDL -C goals 
(Kim et al, 2008).  
Emerging data indicate that more aggressive treatment of hypercholesterolemia is associated with even lower risk for CVD events ( Baigent et al, 2010; LaRosa et al, 2005; 
Cannon et al, 2004); data derived from primary and secondary prevention studies in Asian populations for example are consistent with these findings ( Teramoto, 2011; 
Hiro et al, 2009; Sato et al, 2008; Nakamura et al, 2006; Koizumi et al, 2002). A recent 
Cholesterol Treatment Trialists ’ (CTT) Collaboration meta-analysis 
(CTT  Collaboration, 2010), which included 21 randomized controlled trials of statin 
versus control involving nearly 170,000 patients, showed that for every ~ 1 mmol/L 
reduction in LDL-C, there was an approximately 20% reduction in the risk of major 
vascular events (coronary death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, coronary 
revascularization, or stroke). Importantly, this meta-analysis, which evaluated 5 trials that 
compared more versus less intensive statin therapy, did not find a LDL-C threshold; additional vascular risk reduction is possible in patients with low LDL-C.  
Product:  Evolocumab  
Protocol Number:  20120119  
Date:  11 November 2015  Page 20 of 90 
CONFIDENTIAL    Despite achieving their LDL-C goals, approximately two-thirds of patients on lipid 
reduction therapy still have cardiovascular events ( Libby, 2005).  While it is unlikely that 
this residual risk is entirely due to LDL-C concentrations above the goal articulated in 
recent treatment guidelines ( NCEP, 2002; Grundy et al, 2004), CTT Collaboration data 
suggest that novel agents that are capable of providing additional reductions in LDL-C 
above what is possible with statins may further reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality  (CTT Collaboration, 2010). Furthermore, novel therapies are needed for 
individuals who are intolerant to statin therapy and cannot achieve their respective LDL-C goals (Bruckert et al, 2005; Franc et al, 2003). 
Non-statin treatment options are currently available to lower LDL-C but their potency is 
limited, such that LDL-C reductions occur on the order of 15% to 20%.  Considering the 
remaining cardiovascular risk despite the availability of statin therapy , and given that 
non-statin treatment options have modest efficacy (ezetimibe, bile acid sequestrants [BAS], plant stanols) and/or are poorly tolerated (niacin and BAS), there is an unmet 
medical need for a potent, effective non-statin agent that will get a significant proportion 
of patients to LDL-C goal and further reduce cardiovascular risk. This need is especially 
evident among individuals at high risk for future cardiovascular events, for example 
those who  have already suffered from a myocardial infarction or stroke or individuals 
with diabetes. Based on the current data, evolocumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody to proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), may fulfill this need 
and may provide an important addition to the treatment of hyperlipi demia/dyslipidemia 
for individuals with hyperlipidemia, including individuals with concomitant diabetes . 
2.3 Evolocumab Background 
2.3.1 Mechanism of Action and Therapeutic Potential 
Recycling of the hepatic cell surface LDLR plays a critical role in the maintenance of cellular and whole body cholesterol balance by regulating plasma LDL- C levels.  
Recently it has been shown that PCSK9 plays an important role in the recycling and regulation of LDLR ( Horton et al, 2007; Brown and Goldstein, 2006).  PCSK9 is a 
member of the subtilisin family of serine proteases and is expressed predominantly in 
the liver, kidney, and intestine ( Zaid et al, 2008).  Following secretion, it causes 
post-translational downregulation of hepatic cell surface LDLR by a mechanism that 
involves direct binding to the LDLR.  Downregulation of hepatic LDLR in turn leads to increased levels of circulating LDL-C.  Thus PCSK9 may represent a target for inhibition 
by novel therapeutics in the setting of d yslipidemia.  The rationale for such an approach 
Product:  Evolocumab  
Protocol Number:  20120119  
Date:  11 November 2015  Page 21 of 90 
CONFIDENTIAL    is available from studies in preclinical models, and from human genetic data that provide 
strong validation for the role of PCSK9 in modulating LDL-C levels and the incidence of CHD in man.  These human studies have identified gain-of-function mutations in the 
PCSK9 gene that are associated with elevated serum LDL-C levels  (> 300 mg/dL 
[approximately 7.8 mmol/L]) and premature CHD ( Abifadel
 et al, 2003); and 
loss-of-function (LOF) mutations that are associated with low serum LDL- C levels 
(≤ 100 mg/dL [approximately 2.6 mmol/L]) ( Cohen et al, 2005).  Strikingly, subjects with 
heterozygous LOF mutations exhibit lower serum PCSK9 levels and as much as 
88% reduction in the incidence of CHD over a 15-year period compared with noncarriers 
of the mutations ( Cohen et al, 2006).  Moreover, despite complete loss of PCSK9 and 
associated very low serum LDL-C levels (<  20 mg/dL [approximately 0.5 mmol/L]), the 
2 subjects who have been identified with compound heterozygote LOF  mutations appear 
healthy ( Hooper et al, 2007; Zhao et al, 2006). 
Evolocumab  is a fully human monoclonal immunoglobulin (Ig) G2 that binds specifically 
to human PCSK9 and prevents the interaction of PCSK9 with LDLR.  Details of the biochemistry, nonclinical pharmacology, nonclinical pharmacokinetics (PK), and nonclinical toxicology with evolocumab are contained in the 
AMG 145 Investigator’s  Brochure .  Evolocumab binds to human, monkey, and hamster 
PCSK9 with high affinity (K
d < 100 pM).  Evolocumab caused a dose-dependent 
inhibition of PCSK9 binding to the LDLR and of PCSK9- mediated reduction in 
low-density lipoprotein (LDL) uptake in human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line 
(HepG2) cells in culture.  In cynomolgus monkeys and in hamsters, in vivo 
administration of evolocumab resulted in reduced serum lipoprotein cholesterol levels in 
a dose-dependent manner.  Based on a comprehensive package of PK, pharmacodynamics (PD), and toxicology studies ( AMG 145 Investigator’s Brochure), 
a program to develop evolocumab  as a treatment for dyslipidemia was initiated.  
2.3.2 Clinical Experience:  Efficacy 
In a single-dose, phase 1a study (20080397), complete suppression of circulating 
PCSK9 was observed at doses ≥ 70 mg SC, which correlated well with the effects seen 
on circulating LDL-C).  Following a SC dose, PCSK9 suppression was rapid and was 
observed at the first measured time point after administration (4 hours). 
In the ascending, multiple-dose, phase 1b study (20080398), regimens of 140 mg Q2W, 280 mg Q2W, and 420 mg Q4W were associated with near complete suppression of 
PCSK9, and the degree of PCSK9 suppression correlated well with the effects seen on

Protocol Number:  20120119  
Date:  11 November 2015  Page 22 of 90 
CONFIDENTIAL    circulating LDL-C (see AMG 145 Investigator’s Brochure).  Following a SC dose, PCSK9 
suppression was rapid and the time course of suppression was consistent with that 
observed following a single dose (Study 20080397).  Subjects receiving evolocumab  
with high-dose statins had a similar degree of PCSK9 suppression as subjects receiving evolocumab  with lower doses of statins.  Subjects with heterozygous familial 
hypercholesterolemia who received evolocumab  exhibi ted a similar degree of PCSK9 
suppression as subjects without heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia who 
received evolocumab (Dias et al, 2012). 
Findings from 4 completed phase 2 studies (20101154, 20101155, 20090158, and 
20090158) and ongoing results from phase 2 open-label extension Study 20110110 demonstrated that evolocumab is effective in various patient populations  
(Giugliano et al, 2012; Koren et al, 2012; Sullivan et al, 2012 ; Raal et al, 2012).  
Treatment with evolocumab as monotherapy or in combination with statins (or other lipid 
lowering therapies) was effective in lowering serum concentrations of LDL-C, total cholesterol, ApoB 100, VLDL-C, triglycerides, Lp(a), non-HDL -C, total cholesterol/HDL-C 
ratio, ApoB 100/ApoA1 ratio, and PCSK9, and in increasing serum concentrations of 
HDL-C and ApoA1, in subjects with hyperlipidemia or mixed dyslipidemia (including 
heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia and statin-intolerant subjects).  Of the 6 evolocumab doses tested in phase 2, SC doses of 140 mg Q2W and 420 mg Q4W 
resulted in the greatest effects on lipid parameters and produced comparable results over the dosing interval.  
Sensitivity analyses and non-parametric analyses confirmed that the primary endpoint analysis of efficacy was robust.  Subgroup analyses of the primary efficacy endpoint of percent change in LDL-C from baseline to week 12 demonstrated consistent treatment effects across all subgroups including sex, presence or absence of diabetes, presence 
or absence of metabolic syndrome, screening LDL-C < or ≥ 130 mg/dL, baseline 
triglyceride level, age (< 65 or ≥ 65 years), intensive statin use at baseline (yes/no), and 
race.

CONFIDENTIAL    that evolocumab has an acceptable benefit:risk profile up to the highest dose tested 
(420 mg).  Specifically: 
• In completed phase 2 studies, subjects treated with evolocumab had a higher overall 
incidence of treatment emergent adverse events compared with placebo (57% and 
48%, respectively); however, there was no relationship between the dose or dosing 
frequency of evolocumab and the incidence of treatment emergent adverse events.   
• In completed phase 2 studies, adverse events with a subject incidence of ≥ 2% in the 
evolocumab  group and exceeding the placebo incidence by ≥ 1% were as follows 
(evoloc umab , placebo): nasopharyngitis (8.2%, 6.6%), myalgia (2.7%, 1.0%), and 
nausea (2.7%, 1.7%). 
• In completed phase 2 studies, the overall incidence of serious adverse events was 
similar between the evolocumab and placebo groups (2.1% and 1.3%, respectively).  
No individual serious adverse event was reported for > 2 (0.2%) subjects treated with 
evolocumab  in these studies.  
• There was a higher incidence of creatine kinase elevations in the evolocumab group 
compared with placebo.  These elevations were generally associated with obvious precipitating events in the form of strenuous physical activity.  All of these events were transient (1 laboratory abnormality followed by normal laboratory values), resolved spontaneously  (by next laboratory assessment), and did not lead to 
discontinuation of investigational product (IP).

2.4 Statin Background 
In this study, evolocumab in combination with 20 mg QD atorvastatin will be compared 
with placebo in combination with 20 mg QD atorvastatin.  The clinical benefits of statin 
treatment in primary prevention as well as secondary prevention have been documented 
in multiple trials ( Weart and Hogan, 2011).  A recent meta-analysis confirmed a 
beneficial effect on all -cause mortality as well as combined fatal and non -fatal 
cardiovascular endpoints in primary prevention ( Taylor et al, 2011). 
Several large-scale clinical trials have assessed the efficacy of atorvastatin in the 
primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular events in patients with diabetes 
mellitus and/or metabolic syndrome (Arca, 2007). 
A study conducted specifically in patients with type 2 diabetes found atorvastatin to be 
safe and efficacious in reducing the risk of first cardiovascular disease events, including 
stroke (Colhoun et al, 2004) .  The st udy was terminated 2 years earlier than expected 
Product:  Evolocumab

Date:  11 November 2015  Page 24 of 90 
CONFIDENTIAL    because the prespecified early stopping rule for efficacy had been met. Median duration 
of follow -up was 3.9 years.  Risk rate reduction for having at least one major 
cardiovascular event was 37% [95% CI -52 to -17], p=0.001).  Assessed separately, 
acute coronary heart disease events were reduced by 36% ( -55 to -9), coronary 
revasculariz ations by 31% (-59 to 16), and rate of stroke by 48% ( -69 to -11). 
Atorvastatin reduced the death rate by 27% ( -48 to 1, p=0.059).  No excess of adverse 
events was noted in the atorvastatin group.  These results are similar to the results of 
the ASCOT- LLA trial  (Sever et al, 2005) which  included 2532  hypertensive diabetic 
patients, where atorvastatin (vs placebo) reduced the relative risk of all cardiovascular 
events and procedures by 23% (p = 0.036) and the Heart Protection Study (HPS) where 
simvastatin reduced the relative risk (vs placebo) of major cardiovascular events by 33% 
(p = 0.0003) over 5 years  (Collins et al, 2003). 
In secondary prevention, substudies of the GREACE (GREek Atorvastatin and Coronary -heart-disease Evaluation), TNT (Treating to New Targets) and PROVE -IT 
(PRavastatin Or atorVastatin Evaluation and Infection Therapy) trials reported results for the approximately 15-25% of study participants who had diabetes  (Athyros et al, 2003; 
Shepherd et al, 2006; Ahmed et al, 2006). In the GREACE substudy, atorvastatin (vs physicians' standard care) significantly reduced the relative risk of total mortality by 
52% (p = 0.049), coronary mortality by 62% (p = 0.042), coronary morbidity by 59% 
(p < 0.002) and stroke by 68% (p = 0.046). In the TNT substudy, incidence of the 
primary endpoint was significantly lower in diabetic patients treated with atorvastatin 
80 mg/day rather than 10 mg/day (13.8% vs 17.9%; relative risk 0.75; p = 0.026). In the 
PROVE-IT substudy, a significantly lower incidence of acute cardiac events was 
reported for atorvastatin versus pravastatin recipients (21.1% vs 26.6%; p = 0.03) and, therefore, an absolute risk reduction of 5.5% was associated with atorvastatin therapy.  
Reported adverse events arising from statin therapy are infrequent and rarely severe 
(Weart and Hogan, 2011).  Though some studies have suggested an association 
between lower LDL cholesterol levels and hemorrhagic stroke or intracranial hemorrhage ( Iso et al, 1989; Collins  et al, 2004; Amarenco et al, 2006), several 
contemporary studies utilizing high doses of potent statins as well as two large 
meta-analyses have not observed this association ( Waters  et al, 2006; 
CTT Collaboration, 2010; Hackam  et al, 2011).  Regarding other safety profile data 
available for statins, a pooled analysis of 49 atorvastatin trials demonstrated that the 
overall safety profiles for the 10- and 80-mg/day doses  are comparable, with the 
Product:  Evolocumab

CONFIDENTIAL    exception of a slightly increased rate of elevations in levels of the hepatic  enzymes 
alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) for the higher 
dose (Newman et al, 2006).  The most common adverse effects experienced by patients  
taking statins are those associated with the musculoskeletal  system, and these effects 
occur with all statins.  Symptoms are usually restricted to muscle pain, weakness and/or 
cramps .  Myalgia, which according to various definitions may include some or all of 
these relatively minor symptoms, typically  affects 5% to 10% of patients receiving statins  
(Weart and Hogan, 2011). 
Refer to the regional manufacturer package insert for additional information. 
2.5 Rationale 
It is anticipated that evolocumab may be used in diabetic individuals who cannot achieve 
their LDL-C goals despite the use of statin therapy or are intolerant to statin therapy 
(Bruckert et al, 2005; Franc et al, 2003). Therefore, it is important to understand the 
safety and efficacy of evolocumab on the background of statin therapy  in diabetic 
patients . 
Because lipid levels may vary with diet and body weight it is not possible to assess the true effect of evolocumab on lipid parameters as well as its safety and tolerability without 
a double-blind, randomized placebo -controlled comparator arm . 
The statin background therapy chosen for this study is atorvastatin which is also used in other evolocumab phase 3 trials including FOURIER, a large cardiovascular ( CV) 
outcomes study.  A torvastatin has been selected because of the robust clinical 
outcomes data that supports its use as well as the fact that it has been studied in a  
dedicated Diabetes cardiovascular outcomes trial ( Colhoun et al, 2004). Atorvastatin 
also has a favorable safety  and tolerability profile in comparison to other statins 
(SEARCH Study Collaborative Group 2007; Olyaei  et al, 2011, Cannon et al, 2004)  
Based on regional medical practices , the 20 mg dose of atorvastatin was included in this 
study.  It is a frequently used dose and renders a significant proportion of the maximal 
LDL-C reduction available with higher doses ( LIPITOR
 [atorvastatin calcium] package 
insert). 
The percent change from baseline in LDL-C has been chosen as the primary 
assessment for this study because current guidelines focus on LDL-C as a target for therapy.  There is an extensive body of data from interventional studies and epidemiological evidence demonstrating a strong causal relationship between serum 
Product:  Evolocumab  
Protocol Number:  20120119  
Date:  11 November 2015  Page 26 of 90 
CONFIDENTIAL    LDL-C and the risk of CHD.  These data also support the relationship with other clinical 
manifestations of atherosclerosis such as cerebrovascular disease (stroke) or peripheral 
vascular disease.  These relationships are  present over a broad range of LDL-C levels.  
Non-HDL cholesterol (non-HDL -C), ApoB100, total cholesterol, the ratio of 
total cholesterol/HDL-C, and the ratio of ApoB 100/ApoA1 have been included as 
secondary efficacy endpoints because these markers are known and/or useful markers of cardiovascular risk under certain circumstances and have been identified in prior 
studies to be affected by treatment with evolocumab.  Some  of these measures may be 
employed as future targets for lipid lowering therapy.  
Triglycerides and HDL-C were included because subjects with diabetes frequently have low HDL and/or high triglycerides and because data from Amgen’s phase 1 and phase 
2 studies (Dias et al, 2012; Giugliano et al, 2012; Koren et al, 2012; Sullivan et al, 2012; 
Raal et al, 2012) suggest lowering of triglycerides and raising of HDL-C may be effects 
of treatment with evolocumab.  In addition, triglycerides and HDL-C are independent risk 
factors for cardiovascular disease ( Austin et al, 1998;  Sarwar et al, 2007). 
2.6 Clinical Hypotheses 
The primary hypothesis is that both dosing regimens  of SC evolocumab  (140 mg Q2W 
and 420 mg QM ) in combination with atorvastatin QD will be well tolerated and will result 
in greater reduction of LDL-C, defined as mean percent change from baseline at weeks 10 and 12 and percent change from baseline at week 12, compared w ith placebo (Q2W 
and QM) in combination with atorvastatin QD in diabetic  subjects with hyperlipidemia or 
mixed dyslipidemia.  
3. EXPERIMENTAL PLAN  
3.1 Study Design 
This is a phase 3, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, stratified, placebo-controlled study of evolocumab for diabetic subjects with hyperlipidemia or mixed dyslipidemia.  
After undergoing screening procedures, including laboratory assessments and a 
screening placebo injection, approximately 900 subjects meeting eligibility criteria and 
completing at least 4 weeks of lipid stabilization on atorvastatin 20 mg QD will be 
randomized 2:2 :1:1 into the following treatment arms:  
• evolocumab  SC 140 mg Q2W and atorvastatin PO 20 mg QD  
• evolocumab  SC 420 mg QM and atorvastatin PO 20 mg QD  
• placebo SC Q2W and atorv astatin PO 20 mg QD, or  
• placebo SC QM and atorvastatin PO 20 mg QD .

CONFIDENTIAL    The sample size for each of the evolocumab plus atorvastatin dosing regimens will be 
approximately 300 subjects.  The sample size for each of the placebo plus atorvastatin 
dosing regimens  will be approximately 150 subjects.  
Randomization into the 4 treatment groups will be stratified by entry statin therapy 
(no statin use vs non-intensive statin use vs intensive statin use [see Appendix  D]) and 
by the site’s geographic region.  Treatment and follow -up period will be 12 weeks with an 
additional phone call or other subject contact at week 14 for subjects receiving IP  Q2W.  
Evolocumab  and placebo SC will be administered at the study site or appropriate 
non-investigator  site settings, eg, at the subject’s home, per protocol Section 6 and 
Section 7  by spring-based prefilled autoinjector/pen (prefilled AI/Pen) for subj ects 
receiving IP  Q2W and by 3.5 mL Personal Injector for subjects receiving IP QM.  The 
dose frequencies of Q2W and QM will not be blinded but the identity of IP (evolocumab 
or matching SC placebo) will be blinded.  Post-IP treatment central laboratory results of 
the lipid panel, ApoA1, ApoB100, ApoB48, free fatty acids, chylomicrons, lipoprotein(a), 
PCSK9, insulin, proinsulin, C-peptide, glucagon, IL-6, adiponectin, vitamin E, PK, and 
high sensitivity C -reactive protein (hsCRP) will be blinded until unblinding of the clinical 
database and will not be reported to the investigator post-screening.  Inves tigators 
should not perform non- protocol testing of these analytes during a subject’s study 
participation and until at least 12 weeks after last IP administration, or the subject’s end of study, whichever is later. 
The study includes collection of biomarker samples and, where approved by the 
institutional review board and/or independent ethics committee (IRB/IEC) and applicable 
regulatory and other authorities, subjects will be invited to consent to pharmacogenetics 
analyses .  All subjects will complete a mixed meal tolerance test (MMTT) at the day 1 
and week 12 study visits with 1 postprandial blood collection 2 hours after the meal and 
up to approximately 240 subjects will participate in a MMTT Extended Timepoints 
Substudy with 2 additional postprandial blood draws at 1 and 3 hours after the meal.  End of study (EOS) for subjects on QM IP is at the week 12 visit.  EOS for subjects on 
Q2W IP is by contact (eg, phone call) from the site at week 14 for any potential adverse 
events (AEs), adverse device effects (ADEs) , and serious AEs (SAEs).  Subjects will 
be encouraged to complete all planned visits regardless of their adherence to IP administration.  Accumulating safety and other data will be reviewed by an independent 
external Data Monitoring Committee (DMC).  Where analyte c oncentrations are provided

synopsis section.  
The study endpoints are defined in Section 10.1.1.  
3.2 Number of Sites 
This study will include approximately 100 sites in North America, Europe, Asia, and may 
include sites in Australia, Latin America, Middle East, and/or in Africa.  Additional sites 
may be added if necessary to achieve the enrollment goal within the planned time. 
Sites that do not randomize subjects within 3 months of being open for enrollment may 
be closed. 
3.3 Number of Subjects 
Participants in this clinical investigation shall be referred to as “subjects”.  
There will be approximately 900 subjects randomized in this study.  Justification for the 
sample size can be found in Section 10.2 Sample Size Considerations.  
3.4 R eplacement of Subjects 
There will be no replacement for randomized subjects.  Enrollment will continue until the 
target number of subject s (Section 3.3 ) have been randomized to IP , regardless of the 
number of subjects starting lipid stabilization on atorvastatin. 
3.5 Estimated Study Duration 
3.5.1 Study Duration for Subjects 
After signing the informed consent, subjects should be randomized within 8 weeks.  
Including the screening, study treatment, and follow -up, the maximal total duration of 
study participation for a subject on QM IP schedule will be 20 weeks or approximately 
5 months .  For a subject on Q2W  IP schedule, maximal study duration will be 22 weeks 
or approximately 5 ½ months , including the contact by the site at week 14 to obtain 
potential AE , ADE,  and SAE information. 
3.5.2 End of Study  
The end of the study (primary completion) is defined as the last day on which a randomized subject completes the end-of-study visit or phone follow -up (week 12 for 
subjects on QM IP administration; week 14 for subjects on Q2W IP administration) or 
terminates the study early, whichever is  later.

procedures or completion. 
5. SUBJECT ENROLLMENT  
Before subjects begin participation in any study -specific activities/procedures, Amgen 
requires a copy of the site’s written institutional review board ( IRB) approval of the 
protocol, informed consent form  (ICF) , and all other subject information and/or 
recruitment material, if applicable (see Section 11.2).   All subjects must personally sign 
and date the consent form before commencement of study -specifi c procedures .  SAEs , 
ADEs,  and study -related AEs will be collected upon signing the informed consent form.  
A subject is considered enrolled when the investigator decides that the subject has met 
all eligibility criteria  assessed at screening.  The investigator is to document this decision 
and date, in the subject’s medical record and in/on the enrollment e CRF. 
Each subject who enter s into the screening period for the study  (defined as signing the 
informed consent form ) receives a unique subject identification number before any 
study -related activiti es/procedures are performed.  The subject identification number will 
be assigned by interactive voice response system or interactive web response system 
(IVRS/IWR S).  This number will be used to identify the subject throughout the clinical 
study and must be used on all study documentation related to that subject.  
The subject identification number must remain constant throughout the entire clinical 
study; it must not be changed after initial assignment, including if a subject is 
rescreened.  
5.1 Randomization/Treatment Assignment  
Assignment to the 4 treatment arms (Section 3.1 ) will be based on a 
computer-generated randomization schedule prepared by Amgen before the start of the 
study. 
Each subject will receive a unique randomization number.  Randomization will be 
stratified by entry statin therapy (no statin use vs non-intensive statin use vs intensive 
statin use [see Appendix  D] and by the site’s geographic region. 
Once a subject has completed the end of lipid stabilization assessments and continues 
to meet all eligibility criteria , a site representative will make the randomization call to the 
IVRS/IWRS to assign a randomization number  to the subject.  The randomization call to 
the IVRS/IWRS is accomplished by entering the pertinent information detailed in the IVRS/IWRS user manual.  A confirmation fax or email will be sent to the site to verify that 
Product:  Evolocumab  
Protocol Number:  20120119  
Date:  11 November 2015  Page 33 of 90 
CONFIDENTIAL    the correct information has been entered and to confirm the assignment of a 
randomization number.  A subject will be considered randomized into the study when a randomization number is assigned.  
The randomization date is to be documented in the subject’s medical record and on the 
enrollment eCRF.  
5.2 Site Personnel Access to Individual Treatment Assignments 
A subject’s treatment assignment should only be unblinded when knowledge of the treatment is essential for the further management of the subject on this study .  
Unblinding at the study site for any other reason will be considered a protocol deviation.  
The i nvestigator is strongly encouraged to contact the Clinical Study Manager  before 
unblinding any subject’s treatment assignment, but must do so within 1 working day after 
the event.

CONFIDENTIAL    non-investigator site setting (eg, at home).  The subject (or designee, if not a qualified 
healthcare professional) must have demonstrated competency at administration of SC injections before self-administration is permitted: the first self -administered dose by the 
subject (or designee, if not a healthcare professional) must be administered at the site under the supervision of a healthcare provider . 
Details of preparing IP and the injection procedures are included in the IPIM provided by 
Amgen prior to the start of the study.  The dosing schedule is described by a schema in 
the protocol synopsis . 
When IP  is mandated to be administered at the study site, the date and completion time 
of administration, the body location of the injection, and whether the injection was fully or partially administered are to be recorded on each subject’s  CRF. 
When IP  can be administered at a non -investigator  site location, at a minimum, the dates 
the devices were dispensed and the used devices returned, and for each device whether it was returned fully or partially used are to be recorded on each subject’ s CRF . 
6.2.1.2 Dosage Adjustments, Delays, Rules for Withholding or Restarting, 
Permanent Discontinuation 
There will be no dose adjustments in this study.  If, in the opinion of the investigator, 
a subject is unable to tolerate a specific dose of IP , that subject will discontinue IP  but 
will continue to take atorvastatin and return for all other study procedures and 
measurements until the end of the study . 
If a subject is late for administration of IP, administration should occur as soon as 
possible.  A QM dose of IP should not be administered within less than 7 days of a 
previous dose.  If a QM subject arrives for a visit with IP  administration and IP  was 
administered within the prior 7 days , the dose should not be administered but all other 
study procedures should be conducted.  Administration of IP should occur as soon as 
possible but at least 7 days after the previous administration.  Not more than 2 Q2W 
doses should be administered within any 7-day period.  If a Q2W subject arrives for a visit with IP administration and more than 1 dose of IP was administered within the prior 7 days, the dose should not be administered but all other study procedures should be 
completed.  Administration of IP should occur as soon as possible but at least 7 days 
after the most recent previous administration.  
Subjects who completely miss a dose of IP  will continue in the study and receive the 
next dose of IP per their schedule of administration.

CONFIDENTIAL    6.2.2 Atorvastatin ( Non-Amgen Non-investigational Product ) 
Atorvastatin (non-Amgen non-investigational product) will be used in this study  as 
background therapy.  Atorvastatin will be provided by Amgen .  Additional details 
regarding this product are provided in the Investigational Product Instruction Manual 
(IPIM). 
6.2.2.1 Dosage, Administration, and Schedule 
Atorvastatin 20 mg will be taken orally once daily and should be taken every day at 
about the same time in accordance with instructions in the IPIM.  If taken during a study 
visit, it must be taken after vital signs, ECG, and blood draw procedures  have been 
completed, if applicable. 
The start date of atorvastatin administration, the dates atorvastatin is dispensed and the 
used containers  returned, and the quantity returned are to be recorded on each subject’s 
CRF. 
6.2.2.2 Dosage Adjustments, Delays, Rules for Withholding or Restarting, 
Permanent Discontinuation 
There will be no dose adjustments  for atorvastatin in this study.  If, in the opinion of the 
investigator, a subject is unable to tolerate a specific dose of atorvastatin after having 
been randomized to IP , the Amgen medical monitor should be contacted.  If atorvastatin 
is discontinued, IP  (evolocumab or matching placebo) should be continued unless there 
is a reason to discontinue IP as well.  In either case, the subject should return for all 
other study pr ocedures and measurements until the end of the study . 
Subjects who miss a dose of atorvastatin will be advised to take the missed dose as 
soon as they can; subsequent doses will be taken at the usual time.  However, if the 
next scheduled dose would be due in less than 6 hours, the subject will be advised to 
omit the missed dose entirely and to take the next dose at the normal time. 
6.3 Non-investigational Product s 
All other lipid-low ering drugs that are allowed per protocol and that the subject may be 
taking, must be commercially available and are not provided or reimbursed by Amgen 
(except if required by local regulation).  The investigator will be responsible for obtaining supplies of these drugs.  All such therapy needs to be stable and unchanged during the 
entire time of screening and study participation .

CONFIDENTIAL    6.4 Withholding of Investigational Product or Atorvastatin d ue to 
Elevation of Creatine Kinase (CK)  
If CK is > 5x ULN, CK must be retested before atorvastatin and IP  is administered.  In 
addition, investigators will ask study subjects to promptly report muscle pain, cramps, or 
weakness especially if accompanied by malaise or fever.  If such symptoms occur, the subject’s CK levels should be measured and if CK is > 5x ULN, the subject should be 
instructed to discontinue atorvastatin and IP.  CK must be retested before any 
atorvastatin or IP is administered.   
The following rules apply:   
CK at prior visit  CK on retest  Investigational Product Administration  
> 5x ULN  > 10x ULN  Discontinue atorvastatin and IPa.  Conta ct 
Amgen Medical Monitor  
> 5x to ≤ 10x ULN  Discontinue atorvastatin and retest CK before 
atorvastatin administration.  Consider continuing 
IP if alternative explanation  
≤ 5x ULN  Consider continuing IP and atorvastatin  
a CK elevations >10x ULN that have been confirmed to be secondary to myocardial infarction do not require 
discontinuation of IP  or atorvastatin  
If muscular symptoms are severe and cause daily discomfort, even if the CK levels are 
elevated to ≤  5x  ULN, in consultation with the Amgen medical monitor, discontinuation 
of atorvastatin, or introduction of an alternative statin may be considered at the lowest dose and with close monitoring. Please note that Amgen will not be providing the 
alternative statin. 
 
6.5 Hepatotoxicity Stopping and Rechallenge Rules 
Subjects with abnormal hepatic laboratory values ( ie, alkaline phosphatase [ALP], 
aspartate aminotransferase [AST], alanine aminotransferas e [ALT], total bilirubin [TBL]) 
and/or international normalized ratio [INR] and/or signs/symptoms of hepatitis (as described below) may  meet the criteria for withholding or permanent discontinuation 
of Amgen investigational product or other protocol -required therapies  as specified in the 
Guidance for Industry Drug-Induced Liver Injury:  Premark eting Clinical Evaluation, 
July 2009). 
6.5.1 Criteria for Permanent Discontinuation of Amgen Investigational

Product:  Evolocumab  
Protocol Number:  20120119  
Date:  11 November 2015  Page 38 of 90 
CONFIDENTIAL    Safety Assessment Information) for possible drug-induced liver injury (DILI), if ALL of the 
criteria below are met:  
• TBL > 2x ULN  or INR > 1.5 (testing determined per Appendix  A) 
AND  
• AST or ALT > 3x ULN   
AND  
• no other cause for the combination of the above laboratory abnormalities is 
immediately apparent; important alternative causes for elevated AST/ALT and/or  
TBL values include, but are not limited to: 
− hepatobiliary tract disease 
− viral hepatitis (eg, hepatitis A/B/C/D/E, Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, 
herpes simplex virus, varicella, toxoplasmosis, and parvovirus ) 
− right sided heart failure, hypotension or any cause of hypoxia to the liver causing 
ischemi a.   
− exposure to hepatotoxic agents/drugs or  hepatotoxins , including herbal and 
dietary supplements, plants and mushrooms   
− heritable disorders causing impaired glucuronidation (eg, Gilbert’s Syndrome, 
Crigler -Najjar syndrome) and drugs that inhibit bilirubin glucuronidation 
(eg, indinavir, atazanavir)  
− alpha-one antitrypsin deficiency  
− alcoholic hepatitis  
− autoimmune hepatitis  
− Wilson’s disease and hemochromatosis  
− nonalcoholic fatty liver disease including steatohepatitis (NASH)  
− Non-hepatic causes (eg, rhabdomy olysis, hemolysis ) 
6.5.2 Criteria for Conditional Withholding of Amgen Investigational 
Product and Other Protocol-required Therapies d ue to Potential 
Hepatotoxicity  
For subjects  who do not meet the criteria for permanent d iscontinuation of Amgen 
investigational product outlined above and have no underlying liver disease, and 
eligibility criteria requiring normal transaminases and TBL at baseline or subjects with 
underlying liver disease and baseline abnormal transaminases, the following rules are to 
be followed for withholding of Amgen investigational product and other protocol -required 
therapies:  
• AST or ALT > 8x ULN at any time  
• AST or ALT > 5x ULN but < 8x ULN for ≥ 2 weeks  (or subject unable to adhere to 
enhanced mon itoring schedule)  
Product:  Evolocumab  
Protocol Number:  20120119  
Date:  11 November 2015  Page 39 of 90 
CONFIDENTIAL    • ALT or AST > 3x ULN  with clinical signs or symptoms that are, in the opinion of the 
investigator, consistent with hepatitis (such as right upper quadrant pain/tenderness, 
fever, nausea, vomiting, jaundice, rash or eosinophilia > 5%) 
• TBL > 3x ULN at any time  
• ALP > 8x ULN at any time  
Both atorvastatin and investigational product should be withheld pending investigation 
into alternative causes of DILI.  If atorvastatin or  investigational product is withheld, the 
subject is to  be followed according to recommendations in Appendix  A for possible DILI.  
Rechallenge may be considered if an alternative cause for impaired liver tests (ALT, 
AST, ALP) and/or elevated TBL, is discovered and the laboratory abnormalities resolve 
to normal or baseline ( Section 6.5.3) .   
6.5.3 Criteria for Rechallenge of Amgen Investigational Product and Other 
Protocol-required Therapies A fter Potential Hepatotoxicity  
The decision to rechallenge the subject should be discussed and agreed upon 
unanimously by the subject, i nvestigator, and Amgen.  
If signs or symptoms recur with rechallenge, then investigational product should be 
permanently discontinued.  Subjects who clearly meet the criteria for permanent 
discontinuation (as described in Section 6.5.1) should never be rechallenged. 
6.6 Concomitant Therapy, Physical Exercise, and Diet  
Throughout the study, i nvestigator s may prescribe any concomitant medications or 
treatments deemed necessary to provide adequate supportive care except for those 
listed in Section 6.9. 
Concomitant therapies are to be collected from screening (informed consent date) 
through the end of study.  Therapy name, indication, dose, unit, frequency, route, start 
date and stop date will be collected.

CONFIDENTIAL    Some laboratory results may inadvertently unblind investigators to treatment assignment 
to evolocumab.  Central laboratory results of the lipid panel, ApoA1, ApoB, Lp(a), and hsCRP will not be reported to the investigator (or study personnel) post- screening.  
Investigators should not perform non-protocol testing of these analytes during a subject’s study participation from first administration of IP until at least 12 weeks after last IP administration, or the subject’s end of study, whichever is later . 
7.2.1 Screening, Lipid Stabilization, and Randomiz ation 
Subjects who are considered for entry into the study and have the risk and benefits of 
participating in the study  explained will enter screening by signing and dating the 
informed consent form  for this study.  Screening should be completed and the subject 
randomized or screen failed within 8 weeks of signing the informed consent.   
7.2.1.1 Screening Placebo Injection 
In order to reduce the burden of unnecessary procedures on subjects who subsequently elect not to participate in the study or continue with study procedures, all subjects will undergo a placebo administration to confirm tolerance of SC administration by SC 
injection prior to enrollment.  This placebo administration can be done before or after 
screening venipuncture procedures but must be done before enrollment.  The administration corresponds to the IP dose volume for Q2W  administration and consists 
of 1 injection of 1.0 mL placebo, using 1 AI/Pen.  This administration is following the 
same procedures as injections of IP during the treatment period.  Further details are 
provided in the IPIM.  
7.2.1.2 Screening and Lipid Stabilization  
The following procedures are to be completed during the screening period : 
• confirmation that the Informed Consent Form has been signed  
• demographic data including sex, date of bi rth, age, race, and ethnicity will be 
collected in order to study their possible association with treatment effectiveness, 
subject safety, or, for example, to further study biomarker variability  
• medical history  
• vital signs (sitting BP, heart rate [HR]; see Section 7.7.1) 
• review for AEs /ADEs /SAEs (AEs possibly related to study procedures , ADEs and 
SAEs are collected during screening)  
• concomitant therapy  
• physical examination 
• body height 
• 12-lead ECG in triplicate using centralized ECG services equipment

CONFIDENTIAL    • blood draw for fasting lipids (≥  9 hour fasting sample), chemistry (including fasting 
glucose), hematology, HbA1c, TSH, serum pregnancy (females of childbearing 
potential only), and FSH (only if required to ensure menopause in a female subject [see exclusion criterion 217]) by central laboratory (Note: eGFR will be calculated by 
the central laboratory and will be provided to the site for eligibility determination)  
• blood draws for hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibodies in subjects at high risk for, or with 
history of, HCV infection, or born between 1945 and 1965, or with AST or ALT

− High risk subjects for this protocol are those who meet any of the followin g 
conditions:  
o ever injected illegal drugs  
o received clotting factors made before 1987  
o received blood or organ donation before July 1992 or were 
exposed to blood known to be infected with HCV  
o were ever on chronic hemodialysis  
o are known to be infected with HIV  
o have a known HCV -infected sexual partner  
• the subject will be instructed to maintain his/her current diet throughout the course of  
the study and avoid going on any strict diet or aiming to lose weight during the study  
• screening placebo injection as per Section 7.2.1.1; includes instruction/training on 
AI/Pen use 
• randomization, if eligible  
* Please note that subjects with ALT or AST > 2x  ULN must be screen failed unless the 
elevation is transient as confirmed by retesting per Section 7.2.1.4.  
If a fasting sample could not be obtained at the initial screening visit and the other 
screening laboratory assessments confirm eligibility for the study, fasting lipid and 
glucose samples to determine eligibility must be obtained before changing or 
discontinuing the current lipid lowering treatment. 
Eligible subjects will be enrolled ( Section 5 ) and will start their lipid stabilization on 20 mg 
QD at orvastatin background therapy.  If during lipid stabilization a subject is found not to 
tolerate the assigned atorvastatin background therapy, the subject should not continue 
but should early terminate the study.  In contrast, if intolerance is discovered after randomization to IP, the subject should continue the study until completion.  Before  
reducing or discontinuing treatment with atorvastatin, please contact the Amgen medical 
monitor.   All prohibited lipid lowering therapy (see exclusion 208 and Section 6.9) must 
be discontinued at the start of lipid stabilization.  
After ≥ 4 weeks of lipid stabilization, subjects will return to the study site for the end of 
lipid stabilization assessments.

CONFIDENTIAL    7.2.1.3 Randomization 
Subjects who continue to meet all eligibility criteria at the end of lipid stabilization will be 
randomized and will return to the study site again for day 1 procedures  while continuing 
their atorvastatin background treatment.  Randomization should be on day 1 or as close 
as possible and not earlier than maximally 5 days prior. Subjects can only be 
randomized 1 time for this study. 
7.2.1.4 Retesting 
If, in the investigator’s judgment, lab abnormalities are likely to be transient, (ie, subject 
participated in vigorous exercise and CK is elevated immediately afterwards), laboratory 
tests can be repeated.  Triglycerides, CK, and liver function and other laboratory values, 
except LDL-C, can be retested at any time during screening as long as the subject can 
be evaluated for eligibility and randomized within the allowed screening period.  LDL-C 
should not be retested due to out-of-range LDL-C concentration during screening.  
7.2.1.5 Rescreening 
Subjects receiving statin therapy (any statin) when entering screening and with LDL-C < 100 mg/dL (2.6 mmol/L) at screening and subjects not receiving any statin therapy  
when entering screening and with LDL-C <  130 mg/dL ( 3.4 mmol/L) at screening are 
considered screen failures and cannot be rescreened for this study.  Suitable subjects 
who are ineligible at the initial screening for other reasons and have not been randomized can be re-consented and rescreened at a later time unless they withdraw 
from screening.  For subjects who are rescreened, data from the first screening period 
will not be used for the analysis.  
With the exception of the screening placebo injection, rescreened subjects who are 
re-consented will repeat all screening procedures.  Rescreened subjects will maintain the originally assigned subject identification number . 
7.2.1.6 Screen Fail 
Subjects who fail any of the eligibility criteria during screening or rescreening and have not been randomized need to be screen failed in IVRS/IWRS before they can be 
re-consented and re-registered in IVRS/IWRS for rescreening. 
7.2.2 Treatment  
Subjects who are randomized will visit the study site for treatment start.  The first 
administration of IP should be on the day, or as close as possible to the day , of 
randomization but not later than 5 calendar  days after randomization.  Day 1 is defined 
Product:  Evolocumab  
Protocol Number:  20120119  
Date:  11 November 2015  Page 49 of 90 
CONFIDENTIAL    as the day of first administration of IP .  The date of first administration of IP will be 
recorded in IVRS/IWRS and will determine the schedule of subsequent study visits. 
Subjects must be fasting for  ≥ 9 hours before each study visit where fasting lipid 
samples are obtained.  If the subject is not fasting for the scheduled study day 1 visit, no 
visit procedures are performed.  The subject must return as soon as possible in a fasting 
state for study day 1 visit procedures.  If the subject is not fasting as required for a visit 
after study day 1, visit procedures  should be completed except for  fasting  laboratory  
sample collection and IP  administration, if applicable.  An extra visit must be completed 
for the omitted procedures as  soon as possible and, if possible, within the window for the 
respective visit.  
The following procedures will be completed during the 12 week treatment period at the times designated in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1 ): 
• vital signs (sitting BP, HR; see Section 7.7.1) 
• review for AEs/ADEs /SAEs 
• review of concomitant therapy  
• encourage subject to maintain a stable diet  
• body weight and waist circumference (see Section 7.7.2) 
• 12-lead ECG in triplicate using centralized ECG services equipment 
• blood draw for fasting lipids ( ≥ 9 hour fasting sample), ApoA1, ApoB, chemistry , 
hematology, PK, PCSK9, hsCRP, Lp(a), biomarkers, anti -evolocumab antibodies, 
and viral load in subjects positive for HCV  
• subjects in China only:  blood draw for steroid analytes including cortisol, 
adrenocorticotropic hormone, estradiol, testosterone, luteinizing hormone (LH), and 
FSH 
• mixed meal  tolerance test 
• urine sample for urinalysis  
• urine pregnancy testing for females of childbearing potential  
• dispense and reconcile atorvastatin and instruct subject in administration 
• IP administration at the study site (must be after completion of vital signs, ECG, and 
blood draw procedures , if applicable) 
• dispense AI/Pen or 3.5 mL Personal Injector, respectively, with instructions for use at 
week 4 (all subjects) and week 6 ( Q2W  subjects only)  
No additional blood will be collected for the pharmacogenetics analyses .  For subjects 
who have consented to the pharmacogenetic  portion of this study, DNA will be extracted 
from blood samples already collected on day 1 or another visit (see Section 7.5 
“Pharmacogenetic Studies” and Section 7.6 “Sample Storage and Destruction”).

CONFIDENTIAL    If a subject withdraws from the study  early , all efforts should be made to complete and 
report the observations as thoroughly as possible up to the date of withdrawal.  If 
possible, the procedures of week 12 should be completed at the time of withdrawal. 
7.2.3 Safety Follow -up Visit (s)/End of Study Visit  
Subjects receiving IP QM will end the study with the w eek 12 visit.  Subjects on Q2W IP 
schedule will end the study by being contacted by the site, eg, by phone call, at week 14 
to collect any AEs, ADEs, or  SAEs.  
7.3 Antibody Testing Procedures 
Blood samples for antibody testing are to be collected per  Table 1  for the measurement 
of anti -evolocumab binding antibodies.  All subjec ts who have received at 
least 1 administration of evolocumab  will have samples assayed for binding and, if 
positive, neutralizing antibodies. Samples testing positive for binding antibodies will also be tested for neutralizing antibodies and may be further characterized for quantity/titer, isotype, affinity and presence of immune complexes. Sites will be notified of any positive  neutralizing antibody results to evolocumab. If results are not provided, no neutralizing 
antibodies to evolocumab have been detected.  Additional blood samples may be 
obtained to rule out anti -evolocumab  antibodies during the study. Subjects who test 
positive for neutralizing antibodies to evolocumab at the final scheduled study visit will 
be asked to return for additional follow -up testing. This testing should occur 
approximately every 3 months starting from when the site has been notified of the 
positive result, until: (1)  neutralizing antibodies are no longer detectable or (2) the 
subject has been followed for a period of at least 1 year (± 4 weeks). More frequent 
testing (eg, every month) or testing for a longer period of time may be requested in the event of safety -related concerns. Follow -up testing will not be required where it is 
established that the subject did not receive evolocumab. All follow -up results, both 
positive and negative will be communicated to the sites. Subjects who test positive for binding, non -neutralizing antibodies and have clinical sequelae that are considered 
potentially related to an anti -evolocumab antibody response may also be asked to return 
for additional follow-up testing. 
7.4 Biomarker Development  
Biomarkers are objectively measured and evaluated indicators of normal biologic 
processes, pathogenic processes, or pharmacologic responses to a therapeutic 
intervention.

Date:  11 November 2015  Page 51 of 90 
CONFIDENTIAL    It is expected that further advances will occur in the future in investigational techniques 
that look at markers of PCSK9 signaling, LDLR turnover, cholesterol metabolism , 
inflammation, and plaque stability.  It is not possible at this stage to anticipate what these 
advances will be; however, considerable benefit could accrue to future sufferers of 
coronary artery disease if these markers can be correlated with the data from the study.  
It is also important to clarify any potential drug interactions in this population of subjects who will be on a number of other drugs.  For biomarker analysis 14.5 mL of blood will be 
collected at each of the time points indicated in Table 1  so that biomarkers related to, but 
not limited to PCSK9 signaling, LDLR turnover,  cholesterol metabolism , inflammation, 
and plaque stability such as certain glycosylated proteins, matrix metalloproteinases, 
additional markers of inflammation such as myeloperoxidase, bromo and nitro-t yrosine, 
and tumor n ecrosis factor (TNF) cellular adhesion molecules may be studied. 
Refer to the laboratory manual for detailed collection and handling procedures for all biomarker development samples . 
7.5 Pharmacogenetic Studies 
If the subject consents to the optional pharmacogenetic portion of this study, DNA analyses may be performed.  These optional pharmacogenetics analyses  focus on 
inherited genetic var iations  such as those of the PCSK9 gene or the LDLR gene to 
evaluate their possible correlation to the disease and/or responsiveness to the therapies used in this study.  The goals of the optional studies include the use of genetic markers to help in the investigation of cardiovascular disease, hyperlipidemia and other metabolic 
disorders and/or to identify subjects who may have positive or negative response to 
evolocumab .  No additional blood will be collected for this analysis.  For subjects who 
have consented to the pharmacogenetic portion of this study, DNA will be extracted from 
blood samples already collected.  Subjects can participate in the main trial irrespective of 
whether they do or do not consent to the pharmacogenetic portion of the study . 
7.6 Sample Storage and Destruction 
Any blood sample collected according to the Schedule of Assessments (Table 1 ) can be 
analyzed for any of the tests outlined in  the protocol and for any tests necessary to 
minimize risks to study subjects.  This includes testing to ensure analytical methods 
produce reliable and valid data throughout the course of the study.  This can also 
include, but is not limited to, investigation of unexpected results, incurred sample reanalysis, and analyses for method transfer and comparability.

CONFIDENTIAL    All samples and associated results will be coded prior to being shipped from the site for 
analysis or storage.  Samples will be tracked using a unique identifier that is assigned to the samples for the study.  Results are stored in a secure database to ensure 
confidentiality . 
If informed consent is provided by the subject, Amgen can do additional testing on 
remaining samples (ie, residual and back -up) to investigate and better understand 
processes related to PCSK9 signaling, LDLR turnover, cholesterol metabolism , 
inflammation, and plaque stability such as certain glycosylated proteins, matrix 
metalloproteinases, additional markers of inflammation such as myeloperoxidase, bromo 
and nitro-t yrosine, and t umor n ecrosis factor (TNF) cellular adhesion molecules , the 
dose response and/or prediction of response to PCSK9 inhibition, eg, by evolocumab,  
characterize antibody response, and characterize aspects of the molecule 
(eg, mechanism of action/target, metabolites).  Results from this analysis are to be 
documented and maintained, but are not necessarily reported as part of this study.  
Samples can be retained for up to 20 years. 
Since the evaluations are not expected to benefit the subject directly or to alter the 
treatment course, the results of pharmacogenetic , biomarker development, or other 
exploratory studies  are not placed in the subject’s medical record and are not be made 
available to the subject, members of the family, the personal physician, or other third 
parties, except as specified in the informed consent. 
The subject retains the right to request that the sample material be destroyed by 
contacting the investigator.  Following the request from the subject, the investigator is to 
provide the sponsor with the required study and subject number so that any remaining blood samples and any other components from the samples  can be located and 
destroyed.  Samples will be destroyed once all protocol -defined procedures are 
completed.  However, information collected from samples prior to the request for 
destruction, will be retained by Amgen. 
The sponsor is the exclusive owner of any data, discoveries, or derivative materials from 
the sample materials and is responsible for the destruction of the sample(s) at the request of the subject through the Investigator , at the end of the storage period, or as 
appropriate (eg, the scientific rationale for experimentation with a certain sample type no longer justifies keeping the sample).  If a commercial product is developed from this 
research project, the sponsor owns the commercial product.  The subject has no commercial rights to such product and has no commercial rights to the data, information,

See Section 11.3 for subject confidentiality. 
7.7 Standardization of Study Procedures 
7.7.1 Measurement of Vital Signs 
Blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) will be measured at each visit.  Use of an 
automated oscillometric device for BP measurement is preferred and recommended.  BP 
will initially be recorded in both of the subject’s arms unless a concomitant condition 
favors the use of a particular arm.  T he arm with the higher systolic reading at screening 
will then be used for BP determinations throughout the study.  The appropriate size cuff 
should be used.  BP and HR measurements will be determined after the subject has 
been seated for at least 5 minutes.  The subject’s pulse should be measured for 
30 seconds and the number multiplied by 2 to obtain heart rate.  Before randomization, 
BP measurement can be repeated if the previous reading is outside of the eligibility 
range.  The repeat BP measure should be taken at least 2 minutes following the 
previous  measure. 
7.7.2 Waist Circumference 
Subjects should wear minimal clothing to ensure that the measuring tape is correctly 
positioned.  Subjects should stand erect with the abdomen relaxed, arms at the sides, 
feet together and with their weight equally divided over both legs.  To perform the waist meas urement, the lowest rib margin is first located and marked with a pen.  The iliac 
crest is then palpated in the midaxillary line, and also marked.  It is recommended to apply an elastic tape horizontally midway between the lowest rib margin and the iliac 
crest, and tie firmly so that it stays in position around the abdomen about the level of the 
umbilicus.  The elastic tape thus defines the level of the waist circumference, which can 
then be measured by positioning the measuring tape over the elastic tape.  Subjects are 
asked to breathe normally, and to breathe out gently at the time of the measurement to 
prevent them from contracting their muscles or from holding their breath.  Measurements 
should be performed using the same procedure throughout the study.  The reading is 
taken to the nearest centimeter or ½ inch and entered in the source document. 
7.7.3 Subject Compliance W ith Atorvastatin Dosing 
Once the subject has been enrolled, if compliance with atorvastatin falls below 80% or 
goes above 120% (as determined by evaluation of the number of tablets prescribed), the 
investigator (or designee) must re-instruct the subject on proper dosing of the study 
medication as well as determine the factors that resulted in poor compliance with study 
Product:  Evolocumab  
Protocol Number:  20120119  
Date:  11 November 2015  Page 54 of 90 
CONFIDENTIAL    medication.  Subject compliance will be determined by counting the number of tablets 
returned against the number of days the subject should have taken the drug.  Compliance should be assessed at the timepoints indic ated in Table 1  or as ins tructed 
by Amgen. 
7.7.4 Electrocardiograms 
At each scheduled visit where ECGs are being obtained ECGs will be collected in 
triplicate approximately 1 minute apart.  Using equipment supplied to each site, all protocol -specified ECGs will be acquired and transmitted to the centralized ECG 
services provider.  The PI or designated physician will review acquired ECGs.  One (1) 
signed, original ECG tracing should be retained with the subject’s source documents.  At 
the request of the sponsor, the original ECG should be made available to Amgen to be 
manually read by a central reader . 
The centralized ECG services cardiologists will perform standard interpretations of all tracings.  A cardiologist reviewed ECG report will be provided to the study site.  
Investigators must initial and date the ECG reports upon receipt.  If the investigator’s interpretation of any protocol -specified or unscheduled ECG differs from that supplied by 
centralized ECG services provider, it is the responsibility of the investigator to make the final clinical decisions.  The investigator’s interpretation does not need to be reconciled 
with that supplied by centralized ECG services cardiologists.  Any clinical interventions 
based on these results need to be documented in the appropriate source documents and eCRF as applicable.  It is the responsibility of the investigator to obtain additional ECGs required for the clinical management of the subject, using centralized ECG 
services equipment or equipment on-site.  
Further detail about the equipment provided and its use for this study will be provided in 
an Investigator ECG Manual  distributed to the sites before start of enrollment. 
7.7.5 Lipid Measurements 
Only the screening LDL-C concentration will be reported to the site for the eligibility decision.   Central laboratory results of the lipid panel, as well as ApoA1, ApoB, and 
lipoprotein(a) (and PCSK9 and hsCRP) will be blinded post -treatment until unblinding of 
the clinical database. and will not be reported to the investigator post-screening.  In 
addition, investigators and staff involved with this trial and all medical staff involved in the subject’s medical care should refrain from obtaining lipid panels from randomization until at least 12 weeks after the subject’s last administration of IP or until the subj ect 
ends the study, whichever is later (to avoid potential unblinding).  If a lipid panel is

Date:  11 November 2015  Page 55 of 90 
CONFIDENTIAL    drawn, all reasonable steps must be undertaken to avoid informing the subject and study 
personnel of the results.  
7.7.6 Mixed Meal  Tolerance Test (All Subjects)  
A liquid mixed meal  tolerance test ( MMTT ) will be performed after an overnight fast (no 
food or drinks other than water for ≥  9 hours) at the day 1 and the week 12 study visit.  
Each MMTT  should be done at approximately the same time of day throughout the study 
(± 2 hours).  The fasting venous blood samples at each of these 2 visits should be 
collected as close as possible before consuming a standardized mixed meal  (see below) 
and before the subject receives any food or drink (other than water) or investigational product.  Subjects are then fed a standardized mixed meal, as defined in Table 3  below, 
for example Boost
.  The same type standardized mixed meal  should be used for day 1 
and for week 12.   
The beginning of the consumption of the liquid mixed meal  is considered time “0” of the 
MMTT .  Postprandial blood samples are collected at 120 ±  10 min after consumption of 
the standardized mixed meal  for assessment of the following analytes : 
• plasma glucose, insulin, proinsulin, C-peptide, free fatty acids, glucagon, lipids, 
chylomicrons, ApoB48, IL-6, adiponectin, vitamin E .

7.7.7 Mixed Meal  Tolerance Test Extended Timepoints Substudy  
Where offered and locally approved for the study center, subjects can be invited to participate in a MMTT  Extended Timepoints Substudy.  Enrollment into the substudy will 
be capped at approximately 240 subjects.  The substudy consists of 2 additional 
postprandial blood draws in the MMTT  on day 1 and week 12 as per Section 7.7.6.  
Postprandial blood draws for subjects participating in the substudy will be at the 
following timepoints after consumption of the standardized meal : 
• 60 ± 10 min 
• 120 ±  10 min 
• 180 ±  10 min

timepoints .  
8. WITHDRAWAL FROM TREATMENT, PROCEDURES, AND STUDY  
8.1 Subject ’s Decision to Withdraw  
Subjects have the right to withdraw from the study at any time and for any reason 
without prejudice to their  future medical care by the physician or at the institution. 
Subjects (or a legally acceptable representative) can decline to continue receiving IP  
and/or other protocol -required therapies or procedures at any time during the study  but 
continue participation in the study.  If this occurs, the Investigator  is to discuss with the 
subject the appropriate processes for discontinuation from IP  or other protocol -required 
therapies and must discuss with the subject the options for continuation of the S chedule 
of Assessments  (Table 1 ) and collection of data, including endpoints and adverse 
events.  The Investigator  must document the change to the Schedule of Assessments 
(Table 1 ) and the level of follow-up that is agreed to by the subject (eg, in person, by 
telephone/mail, through family/friends, in correspondence/communication with other 
physicians, from review of the medical records).   
Withdrawal of consent for a study means that the subject does not wish to receive 
further protocol -required therapies or  procedures, and the subject does not wish to or is 
unable to continue further study participation.  Subject data up to withdrawal of consent will be included in the analysis of the study, and where permitted, publically available 
data can be included after withdrawal of consent.  The Investigator  is to discuss with the 
subject appropriate procedures for withdrawal from the study.  The investigator should 
ask the subject’s consent to perform the procedures listed under the final study visit.

9. SAFETY DATA COLLECTION, RECORDING, AND REPORTING  
9.1 Adverse Events 
9.1.1 Definition of Adverse Events 
An adverse event is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical trial 
subject.  The event does not necessarily have a causal relationship with study treatment.  
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that any adverse events observed by the 
investigator or reported by the subject are recorded in the subject’s medical record.   
The definition of adverse events includes  worsening of a pre-existing medical condition.  
Worsening indicates that the pre-existing medical condition or underlying disease (eg, 
Product:  Evolocumab  
Protocol Number:  20120119  
Date:  11 November 2015  Page 58 of 90 
CONFIDENTIAL    diabetes, migraine headaches, gout) has increased in severity, frequency, and/or 
duration more than would be expected, and/or has an association with a significantly 
worse outcome than expected.  A pre -existing condition that has not worsened more 
than anticipated (ie, more than usual fluctuation of disease)  during the study or 
involves an intervention such as elective cosmetic surgery or a medical procedure while on study , is not considered an adverse event. 
An adverse device effect is any adverse event related to the use of a medical device.  
Adverse device effects include adverse events resulting from insufficient or inadequate 
instructions for use, adverse events resulting from any malfunction of the device, or adverse events resulting from use error or from intentional misuse of the device. 
The investigator’s clinical judgment is used to determine whether a subject is to be 
removed from treatment due to an adverse event.  In the event a subject, or subject’s 
legally acceptable representative reques ts to withdraw from protocol -required therapies  
or the study due to an adverse event, refer to Section 8.1 for additional instructions on 
the procedures recommended for safe withdrawal from protocol -required therapies or 
the study. 
9.1.2 Definition of Serious Adverse Events 
A serious adverse event is defined as an adverse event that meets at least 1 of the 
following serious criteria:  
• fatal 
• life threatening (places the subject at immediate risk of death)  
• requires in-pat ient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization 
• results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity 
• congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• other medically important serious event  
An adverse event would meet the criterion of “requires hospitalization”, if the event 
necessitated an admission to a health care facility (eg, overnight stay).   
If an i nvestigator considers an event to be clinically important, but it does not meet any 
of the serious criteria, the event could be classified as a serious adverse event under the 
criterion of “other medically important serious event”.  Examples of such events could 
include allergic bronchospasm, convulsions, blood dyscrasias, DILI (see Appendix  A for 
drug-induce d liver injury reporting criteria), or events that necessitate an emergency 
room visit, outpatient surgery, or urgent intervention.

CONFIDENTIAL    9.2 Reporting of A dverse Events 
9.2.1 Reporting Procedures for Adverse Events That d o not Meet Serious 
Criteria  
The i nvestigator is responsible for ensuring that all adverse events observed by the 
investigator  or reported by the subject that occur after randomization and all adverse 
events possibly related to study procedures from signing the informed consent through 
the end of study  are reported using the applicable e CRF (eg, Adverse Event Summary).  
The investigator must assign the following adverse event attributes:  
• adverse event diagnosis or syndrome(s), if known (if not known, signs or symptoms), 
• dates of onset and resolution (if reso lved), 
• severity  
• assessment of relatedness to investigational products (evolocumab or placebo 
and/or the medical device(s)  AI/Pen or 3.5 mL Personal Injector ), or any 
study -mandated activity or procedure, respectively , and 
• action taken. 
The adverse event grading scale used will be the most current version of the NCI 
Common Terminology Criteria for AEs (CTCAE)  grading sc ale.  The grading scale used 
in this study is referenced in Appendix  A.   
The investigator must assess whether the adverse event is possibly related to IP  
(evolocumab or placebo) .  This relationship is indicated by a “yes” or “no” response to 
the question: Is there a reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by 
IP?   
The investigator must assess whether the adverse event is possibly related to the 
prefilled AI/Pen or 3.5 mL Personal Injector  device used to administer IP.  The 
relationship is indicated by a “yes” or “no” response to the question: Is there a 
reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by the device? 
The investigator must assess whether the adverse event is possibly related to any other 
study -mandated activity (eg, screening / lipid stabilization procedure or background 
therapy ).  This relationship is indicated by a “yes” or “no” response to the question:  “Is 
there a reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by another  study 
activity (eg, screening / lipid stabilization procedure or background therapy)?” 
The investigator is responsible for reviewing laboratory test results and determining 
whether an abnormal value in an individual study subject represents a clinically 
significant change from the subject’s baseline values.  In general, abnormal laboratory

Protocol Number:  20120119  
Date:  11 November 2015  Page 60 of 90 
CONFIDENTIAL    findings without clinical significance (based on the investigator's judgment) are not to be 
recorded as adverse events.  However, laboratory value changes that require treatment 
or adjustment in current therapy are considered adverse events.  Where applicable, 
clinical sequelae (not the laboratory abnormality) are to be recorded as the adverse 
event. 
The Investigator is expected to follow reported a dverse events until stabilization or 
reversibility.  If the severity of an adverse event worsens from the date of onset to the 
date of resolution, record a single event for each increased level of severity on the 
Adverse Event e CRF.  
9.2.2 Reporting Procedures for Serious Adverse Events 
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that all serious adverse events observed by 
the investigator or reported by the subject that occur after signing of the informed 
consent through 30 days after the last dose of IP or EOS, whichever is later, are 
recorded in the subject’s medical record and are submitted to Amgen.   All serious 
adverse events must be submitted to Amgen within 24 hours following the investigator’s 
knowledge of the event via the applicable e CRF.   
After the protocol -required reporting period defined above, the investigator does not 
need to actively monitor subjects for serious adverse events.  However, if the 
investigator becomes aware of a serious adverse event after this protocol -required 
reporting period, the investigator will report the event to Amgen within 24  hours following 
the investigator’s knowledge of the event.  Serious adverse events reported outside of 
the protocol -required reporting period will be captured within the safety database as 
clinical trial cases for the purposes of expedited reporting.  
If the electronic data capture (EDC) system is unavailable to the site staff to report the 
Serious  Adverse Event, the information is to be reported to Amgen via an electronic 
Serious Adverse Event (eSAE) Contingency Report Form within 24 hours of the investigator’s knowledge of the event.  See Appendix  B for a sample of the Serious 
Adverse Event Worksheet/electronic Serious Adverse Event Contingency Report Form .  
If the first notification of a Serious Adverse Event is reported to Amgen via the eSerious Adverse Event (eSAE) Contingency Report Form, the data must be entered into the EDC system when the system is again available.   
The investigator must assess whether the serious adverse event is possibly related to IP  
(evolocumab or placebo) .  This relationship is indicated by a “yes” or “no” response to

CONFIDENTIAL    the questi on: Is there a reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by 
IP? 
The investigator must assess whether the serious adverse event is possibly related to 
the prefilled AI/Pen or 3.5 mL Personal Injector device used to administer IP.  The 
relationship is indicated by a “yes” or “no” response to the question: Is there a 
reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by the device? 
The investigator must assess whether the serious adverse event is possibly related to 
any other study -man dated activity (eg, screening / lipid stabilization procedure or 
background therapy).  This relationship is indicated by a “yes” or “no” response to the 
question:  “Is there a reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by another  study acti vity (eg, screening / lipid stabilization procedure or background 
therapy )?” 
The investigator is expected to follow reported serious adverse events until stabilization 
or reversibility .  If the severity of a serious adverse event worsens from the date of o nset 
to the date of resolution, record a single event for each increased level of severity on the Adverse Event e CRF.  
New information relating to a previously reported serious adverse event must be submitted to Amgen.   All new information for serious adverse events must be sent to 
Amgen within 24 hours following knowledge of the new information.  The investigator  
may be asked to provide additional follow -up information, which may include a discharge 
summary or extracts from the medical record.  Information provided about the serious 
adverse event must be consistent with that recorded on the applicable CRF (eg, Adverse Event Summary CRF).  
If a subject is permanently withdrawn from protocol -required therapies because of a 
serious adverse event, this information must be submitted to Amgen.  
To comply with worldwide reporting regulations for serious adverse events, the treatment assignment of subjects who develop serious, unexpected, and related adverse events may be unblinded by Amgen before submission to regulatory authorities.  Investigators 
will receive notification of related serious adverse events reports sent to regulatory authorities in accor dance with local requirements. 
Amgen will report serious adverse events and/or suspected unexpected serious adverse 
reactions as required to regulatory authorities, investigators /institutions, and IRBs/IECs

CONFIDENTIAL    in compliance with all reporting requirements according to local regulations and good 
clinical practice.  
The investigator is to notify the appropriate IRB/I EC of serious adverse events occurring 
at the site and other adverse event reports received from Amgen, in accordance with 
local procedures and statutes.  
9.3 Pregnancy and Lactation Reporting 
If a pregnancy occurs in a female subject, or female partner of a male subject, while the subject is taking protocol -required therapies  report the pregnancy to Amgen as specified 
below . 
In addition to reporting any pregnancies occurring during the study, investigators should monitor for pregnancies that occur after the last dose of protocol -required therapies 
through 15 weeks after the end of treatment with IP. 
The pregnancy should be reported to Amgen Global Patient Safety  within 24 hours of 
the investigator’s knowledge of the event of a pregnancy.  Report a pregnancy on the 
Pregn ancy Notification Worksheet ( Appendix  C).   
If a lactation case occurs while the female subject is taking protocol -required therapies 
report the lactation case to Amgen as specified below.  
In addition to reporting a lactation case during the study, investigators should monitor for 
lactation cases that occur after the last dose of protocol -required therapies through 
15 weeks after the end of treatment with IP .  
Any lactation case should be reported to Amgen Global Patient Safety  within 24 hours  
of the investigator’s knowledge of event.  Report a lactation case on the Lactation 
Notification Worksheet (Appendix  C).

10.1.2 Analysis Sets 
The full analysis set (FAS) includes all randomized subjects who received at least 
1 dose of IP.  This analysis set will be used in both efficacy and safety analyses.  In 
efficacy analyses, subjects will be grouped according to their randomized treatment group assignment.  For safety analyses, subjects will be grouped according to their randomized treatment group assignment with the following exception: if a subject 
receives treatment throughout the study that is different than the randomized treatment 
group assignment, then the subject will be grouped by the actual treatment group.   
The completer analysis set (CAS) includes subjects in the FAS who adhered to the scheduled IP regimen and have observed value for the co-primary endpoints.

10.2 Sample Size Considerations 
The sample size is 300 subjects for  each of the evolocumab SC in combination with 
atorvastatin arms, and 150 subjects for each of the placebo in combination with 
atorvastatin arms.  The sample size should provide adequate power to determine the 
superiority of evolocumab in combination with atorvastatin to placebo in combination 
with atorvastatin as measured by the co-primary endpoints in both dose frequencies  
using the FAS. The primary analysis will require the tests of each co-primary endpoint to be significant at a level of 0.05 (Section 10.5).  From the global phase 2 studies in the 
evolocumab  program, the treatment effect measured as the mean of week 10 and 
week  12 were as large or larger than week 12 and highly correlated (> 85%) with ones at 
week 12.  From the global phase 2 study 20110155, the treatment effects (on top of stable background statin therapy) of evolocumab compared to placebo for 140 mg Q2W 
and 420 mg QM in the mean percent change from baseline in LDL-C are - 66.10 
(95%  CI [-71.48,-60.72])  and -50.33 (95% CI [-56.04,-44.62])  at week 12, respectively  
and the observed evolocumab dose group means in the type 2 diabetes mellitus cohort 
were comparable to the overall population. The power calculation is derived assuming a treatment effect in the percent reduction of LDL-C of at least 35% at week 12 in each 
dose frequency, with a common standard deviation (SD) of 20%. It is assumed that approximately 15% of subjects randomized into IP will end IP early, thus attenuating the treatment effects. It is assumed there will be no treatment effect differences among treatment groups after these subjects  end IP early.  After accounting for treatment 
attenuation due to early IP termination, the assumed treatment effect is a 30% reduction 
in LDL-C with a common SD of 30%. Assuming 2 % of randomized subjects do not 
receive any IP, the planned sample size will provide at least 99% power in testing the 
superiority of evolocumab in combination with atorvastatin to placebo in combination 
with atorvastatin at week 12 in each dose frequency . Therefore, the sample size as 
planned will provide at least 98% (99% x 99%) power for the co-primary endpoints in each of the dose frequencies .  
Since the testing statistics from the Q2W and QM groups are independent, there is approximately a 96% (98% x 98%) chance to show the superiority of both dose frequencies for the co-primary endpoints .

CONFIDENTIAL    Sample size assumptions, such as the missing value rate, will be monitored by the study 
team while maintaining study blind. 
The power calculation is derived using nQuery version 7.01.  
10.3 Access to Individual Subject Treatment Assignments by Amgen or 
Designees 
Blinded individuals will not have access to unblinded information until the study is 
formally unblinded.  Unblinding and potentially unblinding information should not be 
distributed to the study team, investigators or subjects prior to the study being formally unblinded (eg, the formal unblinding may occur at the final analysis rather than during the primary analysis) except as specified (eg, Section 5.2 and Section 9.2.2). 
Individual subject treatment assignments will be maintained by the IVRS/IWRS. Any 
unplanned unblinding occurring during the study period will be documented and reported in the final clinical study report. 
The independent DMC members and Independent Biostatistical Group (IBG) will have 
access to treatment assignments and subject level data from the clinical trial database.  
Amgen staff members who are involved in randomization, biological sample 
management, performing PK, and anti -evolocumab antibody assay analysis will have 
treatment assignment information but will not have access to subject level data from the clinical trial database.  
10.4 Planned Analyses  
10.4.1 Data Monitoring Committee (DMC)  
An external independent DMC has been established to formally review the accumulating data from this and other completed and ongoing studies with evolocumab  to ensure 
there is no avoidable increased risk for harm to subjects.  The independent DMC is chaired by an external academic cardiologist who is an expert in lipids and clinical trials.  Analyses for the DMC are provided by the Independent Biostatistical Group (IBG), which is external to Amgen.  Details are provided in the DMC charter.  
10.4.2 Primary Analysis  
The primary  analysis will be conducted when all subjects have either completed all the 
scheduled s tudy visits or have early terminated from the study.  At that time, the 
database will be cleaned, processed and a snapshot will be taken; the study will also be unblinded.  Based on the snapshot, efficacy and safety analyses will be performed on

CONFIDENTIAL    the FAS.  Unless specified otherwise, the FAS will be the default analysis set in this 
study and data will be summarized by randomized treatment group.  
Analyses will be performed separately by each dose frequency (Q2W and QM) unless 
specified otherwise. 
10.5 Planned Methods of Analysis  
Subject disposition, demographics, baseline characteristics, and exposure to IP will be 
summarized. General Considerations  
Summary statistics for continuous variables will include the number of subjects, m ean, 
median, standard deviation o r standard error, minimum, and maximum.  For categorical 
variables, the frequency and percentage will be given.   
Methods of handling missing data for efficacy endpoints will be described throughout this 
section.  Missing data will not be imputed for safety endpoints. 
In order to preserve the familywise error rate at 0.05, each independent dose frequency 
(Q2W and QM) will be allocated a significance level of 0.05.  For FAS, methods  of 
adjusting for multiplicity due to testing the superiority of evolocumab in combination with 
atorvastatin to placebo in combination with atorvastatin for both the co- primary and 
co-secondary efficacy endpoints  for the co-primary endpoints  within each dose 
frequency are described in the diagram below.  Multiplicity Adjustment Method

be imputed when the repeated measures linear effects model is used.  
The statistical significance of th e treatment effect difference between evolocumab in 
combination with atorvastatin and placebo in combination with atorvastatin will be tested. 
Multiplicity adjustment procedures are defined in Section 10.5.  
Sensitivity Analysi s 
To evaluate the robustness of the analysis results, sensitivity analyses will be performed 
as follows:  
• The primary analysis will be repeated using the CAS.  
• Non-parametric analyses will be performed.  
Subgroup Analysis  
If applicable, subgroup analyses on the co-primary endpoints will be conducted using the 
stratification factors and baseline covariates.   
10.5.2 Co-secondary Efficacy Endpoint s 
The statistical model and testing of the tier 1 co- secondary efficacy endpoints will be 
similar to the primary analysis of the co-primary endpoints.   The co -secondary efficacy 
endpoints of LDL-C target achievement will be analyzed using the 
Cochran-Mantel -Haenszel (CMH) test adjusted by the stratification factor s. 
Analyses of the tier 2 co- secondary efficacy endpoints will use the same analysis model 
as the tier 1 endpoints, and testing will use a union-intersection test.  
Multiplicity adjustment procedure of testing evolocumab in combination with atorvastatin 
vs. placebo in combination with atorvastatin for co-secondary endpoints is defined in 
Section 10.5. 
10.5.3 Safety Endpoints 
Adverse Events  
Adverse events will be  coded using the current version of the  Medical Dictionary for 
Regulatory Activities (MedDRA).  Subject incidences of treatment-emergent adv erse 
events, serious adverse events and adverse events leading to discontinuation of IP will be tabulated by system organ class and preferred term for each treatment group.

termination of the study and before the product(s) is /are available commercially.  
12.2 Study Documentation and Archive 
The investigator is to maintain a list of appropriately qualified persons to whom he/she 
has delegated study duties.  All persons authorized to make entries and/or corrections on CRFs will be included on the Amgen Delegation of Authority Form.  
Source documents are original documents, data, and records from which the subject’s CRF data are obtained.  These include but are not limited to hospital records, clinical 
and office charts, laboratory and pharmacy records, diaries, microfiches, radiographs, 
and correspondence.  
In this study, the IVRS/IWRS  system captures the following data points and these are 
considered source data:   protocol number, site number, subject ID, gender, date of birth, 
date informed consent was signed, treatment group assignment, screen failure reason, 
randomization date, randomization number and IP box ID assignment.

CONFIDENTIAL    12.3 Study Monitoring and Data Collection 
The Amgen representative(s) and regulatory authority inspectors are responsible for 
contacting and visiting the investigator for the purpose of inspecting the facilities and, 
upon request, inspecting the various records of the clinical study (eg, CRFs and other 
pertinent data) provided that subject confidentiality is respected. 
The Amgen Clinical M onitor is responsible for verifying the CRFs at regular intervals 
throughout the study to verify adherence to the protocol; completeness, accuracy, and 
consistency of the data; and adherence to local regulations on the conduct of clinical researc h.  The Clinic al Mo nitor is to have access to subject medical records and other 
study -related records needed to verify the entries on the CRFs. 
The investigator agrees to cooperate with the clinical monitor to ensure that any 
problems detected in the course of these monitoring visits, including delays in completing CRFs, are resolved. 
In accordance with ICH GCP and the sponsor’s audit plans, this study may be selected 
for audit by representatives from Amgen’s Global Compliance Auditing function 
(or designee s).  Inspection of site facilities (eg, pharmacy, protocol -required therapy 
storage areas, laboratories) and review of study -related records will occur to evaluate 
the study conduct and compliance with the protocol, ICH GCP, and applicable regulatory 
requirements. 
Data capture for this study is planned to be electronic:  
• All source documentation supporting entries into the CRFs must be maintained and 
readily available. 
• Updates to CRFs will be automatically documented through the software’s “audit 
trail”. 
• To ensure the quality of clinical data across all subjects and sites, a clinical data 
management review is performed on subject data received at Amgen.  During this 
review, subject data are checked for consistency, omissions, and any apparent 
discrepancies.  In addition, the data are reviewed for adherence to the protocol and 
GCP.  To resolve any questions arising from the clinical data management review 
process, data queries and/or site notifications are created in the EDC system 
database for site resolution and subsequently closed by the EDC system or by an 
Amgen reviewer. 
• The i nvestigator signs only the Investigator Verification Form for this electronic data 
capture study.  This signature indicates that investigator inspected or reviewed the 
data on the CRF, the data queries, and the site notifications, and agrees with the 
content.

CONFIDENTIAL    Amgen (or designee) will perform self-evident corrections to obvious data errors in the 
clinical trial database, as documented in the Study Specific Self Evident Corrections Plan.  Examples of obvious data errors that may be corrected by Amgen (or designee) 
include deletion of obvious duplicate data (eg, same results sent twice with the same date with different visit- week 4 and early termination) and clarifying “other, specify” if 
data are provided (eg, race, physical examination).  Each investigative site will be 
provided a list of the types of corrections applied to study data at the initiation of the trial 
and at study closeout.  
12.4 Investigator Responsibilities for Data Collection 
The i nvestigator is responsible for comply ing with the requirements for all assessments 
and data collection (including subjects not receiving protocol -required therapies) as 
stipulated in the protocol for each subject in the study.  For subjects who withdraw  prior 
to completion of all protocol -required visits and are unabl e or unwilling to continue the 
Schedule of Assessments (Table 1 ), the investigator can search publically available 
records [where permitted]) to ascertain survival status.  This ensures that the data set(s) 
produced as an outcome of the study is/are as comprehensive as possible.   
12.5 Language 
All written information and other material to be used by subjects and investigative staff 
must use vocabulary and language that are clearly understood.   
12.6 Publication Policy  
To coordinate dissemination of data from this study, Amgen encourages the formation of a publication committee consisting of several investigators and appropriate Amgen staff, 
the governance and responsibilities of which are set forth in a Publication Charter.  The committee is expected to solicit input and assistance from other investigators and to 
collaborate with authors and Amgen staff as appropriate as defined in the Publication 
Charter .  Memb ership on the committee (both for investigators and Amgen staff) does 
not guarantee authorship.  The criteria described below  are to be met for every 
publication.  
Product:  Evolocumab  
Protocol Number:  20120119  
Date:  11 November 2015  Page 76 of 90 
CONFIDENTIAL    Authorship of any publications resulting from this study will be determined on the basis 
of the Uniform Requirement for Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical Journals (International Committee of Medical Journal Editors), which states  (August 2013 
revision) : 
• Authorship credit should be based on (1) substantial contributions to conception and 
design, acquisition of data, or analysis and interpretation of data; (2) drafting the 
article or revising it critically for important intellectual content; (3) final approval of the 
version to be published; (4) agreement to be accountable for all aspects of the work in ensuring that questions related to the accuracy or integrity of any part of the work 
are appropriately investigated and resolved.  Authors  should meet conditions 1, 2, 3, 
and 4. 
• When a large, multi center group has conducted the work, the group should identify 
the individuals who accept direct responsibility for the manuscript.  These individuals 
should fully meet the criteria for authorship defined above. 
• Acquisition of funding, collection of data, or general supervision of the research group, alone, does not justify authorship. 
• All persons designated as authors should qualify for authorship, and all those who 
qualify should be listed.  
• Each author should have participated sufficiently in the work to take public 
responsibility for appropriate portions of the content. 
All publications (eg, manuscripts, abstracts, oral/slide presentations, book chapters) 
based on this study must be submitted to Amgen for review.  The Clinical Trial 
Agreement among the institution, investigator, and Amgen will detail the procedures for, 
and timing of, Amgen’s review of publications.

Drug -induced Liver Injury Reporting & Additional Assessments  
Reporting  
To facilitate appropriate monitoring for signals of DILI, cases of concurrent AST or ALT 
and TBL and/or  INR elevation according to the criteria specified in Section 6.4 require 
the following: 
• The event is to be reported to Amgen as a serious adverse event within 24 hours  of 
discovery or notification of the event (ie, before additional etiologic investigations 
have been concluded)  
• The appropriate CRF (eg, Adverse Event CRF) that captures information necessary 
to facilitate the evaluation of treatment-emergent liver abnormalities is to be 
completed and sent to the Amgen.  
Other events of hepatotoxicity and potential DILI are to be reported as serious adverse 
events if they meet the criteria for a serious adverse event defined in Section 9.2.2. 
Additional Clinical Assessments and Observation  
All subjects in whom investigational product(s) or protocol -required therapies is/are 
withheld (either permanently or conditionally) due to potential DILI as specified in 
Sections 6.5.1 and 6.5.2 or who experience AST or ALT elevations >3 x ULN are to 
undergo a period of “close observation” until abnormalities return to normal or to the subject’s baseline levels.  Assessments that are to  be performed during this period 
include:  
• Repeat AST, ALT, ALP, bilirubin (total and direct), and INR within 24 hours  
• In cases of TBL > 2x ULN or INR  > 1.5, retesting of liver tests, BIL (total and direct), 
and INR is to be performed every 24 hours until laboratory abnormalities improve

CONFIDENTIAL    Testing frequency of the above laboratory tests may decrease if the abnormalities 
stabilize or the investigational product(s) or protocol -required therapies has/have been 
discontinued AND the subject is asymptomatic  
• Initiate investigation of alternative causes for elevated AST or ALT and/or elevated 
TBL: 
− Obtain complete blood count (CBC) with differential to assess for eosinophilia  
− Obtain serum total immunoglobulin IgG, Anti -nuclear antibody ( ANA), Anti 
Smooth Muscle Antibody, and Liver Kidney Microsomal antibody 1 ( LKM1 ) to 
assess for autoimmune hepatitis  
− Obtain serum acetaminophen (paracetamol) levels  
− Obtain a more detailed history of:  
− Prior and/or concurrent diseases or illness 
− Exposure to environmental and/or industrial chemical agents  
− Symptoms (if applicable) including right upper quadrant pain, 
hypersensitivity -type reactions, fatigue, nausea, vomiting and fever  
− Prior and/or concurrent use of alcohol, recreational drugs and special diets  
− Concomitant use of medications (including non-prescrip tion medicines and 
herbal and dietary supplements), plants, and mushrooms  
− Obtain viral serologies 
− Obtain CPK, haptoglobin, Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and peripheral blood smear  
− Perform appropriate liver imaging if clinically indicated 
• Obtain appropriate blood sampling for pharmacokinetic analysis if this has not already been collected  
• Obtain hepatology consult ( liver biopsy may be considered in consultation with an 
hepatologist)  
• Follow the subject and the laboratory tests (ALT, AST, TBL, INR) until all l aboratory 
abnormalities return to baseline or normal.  The “close observation period” is to continue for a minimum of 4 weeks after discontinuation of all investigational 
product(s) and protocol -required therapies.  
The potential DILI event and additional information such as medical history, concomitant 
medications and laboratory results must be captured in corresponding CRFs.

 CONFIDENTIAL  AMENDMENT HISTORY  
Amendment 2  
The main reason s for this amendment are to allow : 
1. The enrollment of patients with adenocarcinoma/adenosquamous as well as squamous 
cell histologies of cervical cancer.  Patients with adenocarcinoma/adenosquamous 
histology will account for up to approximately 20% of the patient population , and this is 
not expe cted to impact the primary endpoint of ORR estimation . 
2. A change in the primary  endpoint of this single arm study from statistical hypothesis 
testing to estimation of the ORR with associated confidence intervals, and to permit an 
administrative assessment after the first 53 patients have had the opportunity for at least 4 
tumor asses sments.   
The following table outlines the changes made to the protocol and the affected sections.  
Description of Change  Brief Rationale  Section # and Name  
Added patients with 
adenocarcinoma/adenosquamous 
histology  and increased the sample 
size to 105 patients.  Based on clinical experience 
with cemiplimab, patients with 
adenocarcinoma/adenosquamous 
histologies may potentially 
benefit from treatment with 
cemiplimab and ISA101b.  List of Abbreviations and Definitions

 CONFIDENTIAL  CLINICAL STUDY PROTO COL SYNOPSIS  
Title  A Phase 2 Study of Cemiplimab, an Anti -PD-1 Monoclonal Antibody, and 
ISA101b Vaccine in Patients with Recurrent/Metastatic HPV16 Cervical 
Cancer Who Have Experienced Disease Progression after First Line 
Chemotherapy  
Site Location(s)  Multiple sites globally.  
Objective(s)  The primary objective of the study is to estimate the clinical benefit of 
cemiplimab + ISA101b after progression on first line chemotherapy, as 
assessed by objective response rate (ORR).  
The secondary objectives of the study are:  
• To characterize the safety profile of cemiplimab + ISA101b  
• To assess preliminary efficacy of cemiplimab + ISA101b as 
measured by duration of response (DOR), progression -free 
survival (PFS), an d overall survival (OS)  
Study Design  This will be a single -arm, phase 2, global study of treatment with 
cemiplimab + ISA101b in HPV16 -positive cervical cancer patients with 
disease progression on first line chemotherapy in the recurrent or metastatic 
setting. Study treatment and duration include cemiplimab every 3  weeks 
(Q3W) (with 3 doses of ISA101b on days 1, 29, and 50) until progression 
or any reason for early discontinuation. The primary endpoint is ORR.  
Patients will undergo screening evaluations to determine eligibility within 
28 days prior to first treatment. All patients will receive the following 
regimen:  
• ISA101b 100 μg/peptide by subcutaneous (SC) injection on day 1, 
day 29, and day 50 (total of 3  doses).  
• Cemiplimab 350 mg given by intravenous ( IV) infusion over 30 
minutes Q3W on days 8 and 29 in cycle 1, on days 1 and 22 in 
cycle 2 through 4, and on days 1, 22, and 43 in all subsequent cycles 
or until disease progression or discontinuation of study drug for any 
other reason.  
Note:  On days 29 and 50, cemiplimab will be administered first, 
and ISA101b will be administered approximately 1 hour after the 
end of the cemiplimab infusion. Patients must be observed for 4 
hours after each ISA101b administration.  
There will be a 90 -day safet y follow -up after the last dose of cemiplimab. 
Patients who discontinue study drug for reasons other than progression will 
be followed approximately every 4 months by scans (eg, CT scan and/or 
MRI) until disease progression or until the patient commences a nother

 CONFIDENTIAL  anticancer systemic therapy, whichever comes first. After progression, 
survival follow -up should occur approximately every 4  months.  
Study Duration  Study duration includes a 28 -day screening period. During the treatment 
period, cycle 1 will be 7 w eeks long, cycles 2 through 4 will be 6 weeks 
long, and all subsequent cycles will be 9 weeks long. Additionally, there 
will be a 90 -day safety follow -up after the last dose.  
Patients will be assessed for response at cycle 1 day 50 (week 7), then once 
per cycle (every 6 weeks for 3 cycles, then every 9 weeks in all subsequent 
cycles or until disease progression or discontinuation of study drug for any 
other reason). Patients with confirmed complete response (CR) after a 
minimum of 48 weeks of treatment may elect to discontinue treatment and 
continue with all relevant study assessments (eg, efficacy assessments).  
The total duration of study from start of screening to final analysis of OS is 
expected to be approximately 36 months (approximately 12 months of 
accrual, approximately 12 months of treatment, and approximately 12 
months of follow up).  
End of Study Definition  The end of the study is defined as the date of the last contact of the last 
patient in the study.  
Population   
 Sample Size:  Approximately 10 5 patients are planned to be enrolled in the study.  
 Target Population:  The study population is patients with HPV16 positive cervical cancer with

 CONFIDENTIAL  1. INTRODUCTION  
1.1. Background on Cervical Cancer  
The global annual incidence of cervical cancer is approximately 527,000 cases per year, and there 
are approximately 265,000 deaths (Torre, 2015 ). The highest incidence rates are in the Caribbean, 
Africa, Eastern Europe, and South America (Forman, 2012 ). In the United States (US), there are 
approximately 13,170 new cases a nd 4,250 deaths annually (Siegel, 2019 ). In most cases, 
causation is due to infection with human papillomavirus (HPV). Although vaccination against high 
risk strains of HPV is projected to gradually decrease the global incidence of cervical cancer in the 
next 15 years , the burden of this disease remains profound (Bray, 2012 ). 
Internationally, the etiologic fraction of HPV -associate d malignancy, based on HPV detection, 
varies by geography and anatomic site, but overall suggests that 70% of cervical cancers are caused 
by HPV16/18, and HPV16 is the primary oncogenic virus in other anogenital and oropharyngeal 
cancers. In a study of 777  cervical cancer tissue samples, the HPV16 genotype was detected in 
50.1% while the HPV18 genotype was detected in 16.1%, comprising 66.2% of HPV -associated 
cervical cancers. Widespread uptake of HPV16/18 vaccines has already been shown to decrease 
high-grade cervical lesions and is anticipated to substantially reduce the burden of HPV -associated 
cancers (Saraiya, 2015 ). 
For patients with locally advanced disease, the curative intent therapy is definitive radiation with 
concurrent cisplatin. However, recurrent or metastatic disease occurs in approximately one third 
of cervical cancer patients in the US. For women with recu rrent or metastatic disease, the GOG240 
study established that standard first line therapy is platinum plus taxane doublet with the addition 
of bevacizumab, if clinically appropriate. Median survival with the triplet regimen is 17 months 
(Tewari, 2014 ). 
After progression on first line platinum -taxane based chemotherapy for recurrent or metastatic 
disease, conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy has limited efficacy. Non -randomized phase 2 trials 
have demonstrated survival times of 7.4 to 8.1 months (N = 29 and N = 43 patients, respectively) 
with single  agent pemetrexed, gemcitabine, topotecan, vinorelbine, or irinotecan monotherapy 
(Lorusso, 2010 ), (Miller, 2008 ), (Schilder, 2005 ), (Bookman, 2000 ), (Muggia,  2004 ), 
(Muggia,  2005 ), (Look, 1998 ), (Takeuchi, 1991 ).  
Immunotherapy for advanced cervical cancer is a burgeon ing field. Almost all cervical cancer is 
associated with high risk strains of HPV (Cancer Genome Atlas Research, 2017 ), and the presence 
of viral antigen may support anti -tumor immune responses. An exampl e of a virally -associated 
tumor for which immunotherapy has demonstrated efficacy is Merkel Cell carcinoma 
(Gillison,  2016 ), (Nghiem, 2016 ). Cervical squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) may evade immune 
response by expression of PD -L1 (programmed -death ligand 1), the ligand for the immune -
checkpoint receptor PD -1 (programmed death -1) on T cells (Heeren, 2016 ).  
A non -randomized phase 2 trial of the anti -PD1 antibody pembrolizumab showed a durable 
response rate for patients with PD -L1 positive metastatic or recurrent cervical cancer treated with 
pembrolizumab monotherapy. Response rate for these patients was 14.6% (12/82 patients) with a 
median follow up time of 10.2 months (0.6 to 22.7 months) (Chung, 2019 ). These data led to an

 CONFIDENTIAL  recurrent cervical cancer treated with nivolumab monotherapy. Response rate for these patients 
was 26.3% (5/19 patients) with a median follow up of 19.2 months (1.4 to 31.4  months) 
(Naumann,  2019 ). An ongoing multicohort phase 1/2 trial showed early signals of durable 
responses in both first and second line metastatic cervical cancer with combination therapy with 
nivolumab and ipilimumab, an antibody direct ed against the CTLA -4 immune checkpoint. 
Responses ranged from 23.1% (6/26 patients) to 45.8% (11/24  patients) in varying dose levels. 
Median follow -up time ranged from 10.7 to 13.9 months (Naumann, 2019 ). The anti -PD1 
monoclonal antibody cemiplimab (also known as REGN2810) has also demonstrated preliminary 
efficacy against cervical cancer, as described in Section  1.2. 
These data are reassuring that immunotherapy has a role in recurrent/metastatic cervical cancer. 
While PD -1/PD -L1 blockade alone has a modest response rate, the consistent durability of these 
responses make it into a reasonable backbone for future combinat ion therapies.  
Taken together, these data support a single arm study of the anti -PD1 antibody cemiplimab in 
combination with other agents such that may enhance anti -tumor immune responses, such as 
ISA101b in patients with recurrent or metastatic HPV16+ ce rvical cancer with SCC  and AC 
histology who have experienced disease progression after first line chemotherapy (Section  1.3). 
1.2. Background on Cemiplimab  
LIBTAYO® (cemiplimab) is approved for the treatment of patients with metastatic cutaneous 
squamous cell carcinoma or patients with locally advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma 
who are not candidates for curative surgery or curative radiation. It is also approved for the 
treatment of patients with locally advanced basal cell carcinoma, and as a first -line treatment 
option in advanced non -small cell lung cancer. In the United States, it is approved with a suffix as 
cemiplimab -rwlc.  
Cemiplimab is a high -affinity, recombinant human immunoglobulin G (IgG4P) monoclonal 
antibody that binds to PD -1 and blocks its interaction with programmed death ligand 1 (PD -L1) 
and programmed death -ligand 2 (PD -L2), countering PD -1-mediated inhibition of the anti -tumor 
immu ne response. Cemiplimab is being evaluated in more than 20  phase 1 through phase 3 clinical 
studies in a variety of tumor types. The safety profile of cemiplimab demonstrated in these clinical 
trials is consistent with the expected safety profile of an ant i-PD-1 antibody.  
In the cemiplimab phase 1 study (R2810 -ONC -1423), patients with cervical cancer were enrolled 
in the dose escalation phase and in 2 expansion cohorts. Cumulatively, there were 4/23 (17%) 
responses. All responses were in SCC patients. Durat ion of response ranged from 6.4 to 
14.7 months ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]).  
Cemiplimab is currently under investigation in R2810 -ONC -1676, an open -label, randomized, 
multi -center, phase 3 trial comparing cemiplimab versus investigator’s choice (IC) chemotherapy 
in patie nts with recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer after platinum -based therapy. The primary 
objective is to compare overall survival (OS) between the arms.  The trial showed a clinically and 
statistically significant survival benefit in patients with squamou s cell carcinoma (SCC) and 
adenosquamous/adenocarcinoma (AC) histology. A total of 608 patients, including 477 patients 
with SCC histology and 131 patients with AC histology, were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive 
either monotherapy with cemiplimab or I C chemotherapy. Patients on the cemiplimab arm had a 
median survival of 12.0 months (95% CI 10.3 months to 13.5 months). Patients on the

addition to a survival benef it, patients had a clinically and statistically significant improvement in 
progression free survival (PFS) and overall response rate (ORR) (Tewari, 2021 ). Patients on the 
cemiplimab arm had an OR R of 16.4% (95% CI 12.5% to 21.1%). Patients on the chemotherapy 
arm had an ORR of 6.3% (95% CI 3.8 to 9.6%) (Press Release: Phase 3 Trial of Libtayo®

1.3. Background on ISA101b  
ISA101/ISA101b1 is a therapeutic vaccine targeting the HPV type 16 E6/E7 proteins. The HPV16 
long peptides in ISA101b act as a therapeutic vaccine that stimulates the actions of both CD4+ T-
helper cells and CD8+ cytotoxic T cells against the known oncogenic sequences o f the HPV16 
virus. These long peptides, containing multiple cytotoxic T -lymphocyte (CTL) and T -helper 
epitopes, are predominantly processed by professional antigen presenting cells (APCs), the 
dendritic cells (Bijker, 2007 ), (Bijker, 2008 ), (Rosalia, 2013 ). This leads to presentation of the 
exact amino acid sequences (epitopes) by human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class  I and II molecules 
on dendritic cells.  
ISA101b consists of 9 overlapping long E6 peptides (five 32 -mer and four 25 -mer E6 peptides) 
and three 35 -mer E7 peptides as shown in Figure  1. These pep tides overlap by 10 to 18 residues 
and cover the complete sequence of HPV16 E6. The E7 oncoprotein sequence is almost completely 
represented by the peptide sequences (only amino acids 57 to 63 are not covered), due to the 
omission of 1 poorly manufacturabl e peptide (G -3980 -R).

The peptide sequences are synthetically produced and ind ividually released and stored as bulk 
drug substances according to current good manufacturing processes.

designed to improve the ability to manufacture the vaccine at large scale and to increas e the stability of the 
product.

 CONFIDENTIAL  A dose of 100 μg/peptide has been selected for further study based on both the strength of the 
induced HPV16 immune response and safety data in clinical trials. Additional details are provided 
in the ISA101b Investigator’s Brochure.  
1.3.1.  Nonclinical Data  
ISA101b is designed as a therapeutic vaccine, which targets distinct human pathogenic viral 
antigens and triggers a highly human -specific immune respo nse. The involved 
immunostimulatory/ immunomodulatory effects (eg, cascades of involved chemokines/cytokines 
and cells of the immune system but also organ and target antigen structures), as well as the HPV 
induced effects/target structures are highly human  specific. Consequently, there are no known 
suitable animal species for the non -clinical safety testing of peptide vaccines. The HLA structure 
differs significantly between animal species; therefore, no other animal species shares an identical 
HLA structur e with humans.  
The synthetic long peptides (SLP) used in ISA101b are not able to directly bind to the major 
histocompatibility complex (MHC), but act by being processed by Dendritic cells (DC) of 
experimental animals or human beings, followed by loading i nto the available MHC class I or II 
molecules of the individual animal or person. A selected long peptide of HPV16 E7, when 
formulated with one of several adjuvants, including Montanide ISA 51 VG (Montanide), has 
shown substantial beneficial activity by in ducing murine -specific T -cell responses against 
established tumors in mice induced by HPV16 E6/E7, particularly when combined with 
chemotherapeutics such as cisplatin or a combination of carboplatin and paclitaxel. In rabbits a set 
of overlapping SLP of th e 2 tumorigenic proteins E6 and E7 of cottontail rabbit papilloma virus 
(CRPV) formulated in Montanide induced rabbit -specific immune responses and cured rabbits of 
CRPV -induced papillomas. In summary, efficacy/induction of the targeted immune response was  
demonstrated in mouse and rabbit disease models. Toxicology studies in rats (HPV -16-SLP) and 
rabbits (ISA101) showed high vaccine -induced antibody levels against the immunogen. The 
therapeutic vaccine was well tolerated systemically after SC administratio n at high doses. In these 
studies, the vaccine was given together with the adjuvant Montanide to mimic clinical studies. 
Doses in the rat were up to 120 μg/peptide per injection, while in the rabbit study the animal dose 
(300 μg/peptide per injection) was the same absolute dose as used in earlier clinical trials, not 
adjusted for body weight or surface area. The only findings consisted of injection site findings 
related to the local, immunostimulatory effects of the vaccination.  
Nonclinical data including immunogenicity and toxicology are described in the ISA101b 
Investigator’s Brochure.  
1.3.2.  Clinical Experience  
Previous Experience with HPV -16-SLP 
HPV -16-SLP (a prototype vaccine predecessor of ISA101b produced at the Leiden University 
Medical Center) was tested  in several investigator -sponsored studies in patients with HPV16 
positive gynaecological premalignant and malignant diseases. The combined studies of the Leiden 
University Medical Center research group have shown that in the majority of patients with 
prem alignant cervical intraepithelial neoplasia or vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia lesions, and in 
slightly more than half of the patients with recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer, a positive T -cell

 CONFIDENTIAL  response can be induced by vaccination with HPV -16-SLP i n Montanide adjuvant compared with 
a weak or nondemonstrable T -cell response in patients who were not vaccinated. These results 
were recently confirmed in an independent study with vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia patients 
(van Poelgeest, 2016 ). 
In a pilot study in patients with late stage cervical cancer, the T -cell immune responses induced by 
a single dose of HPV -16-SLP were considerably augmented by timing the vaccination 15  days 
after the second cycle of carboplatin/paclitaxel chemotherapy, due to the mu ch lower levels of 
myeloid -derived suppressor cells, but intact T cell numbers and function at this time point 
(Welt ers, 2018 ). 
CervISA Study of ISA101/101b in Patients with Advanced, Metastatic, or Recurrent HPV16 
Positive Cervical Cancer  
Encouraging results using ISA101/ISA101b have been observed in a single arm stu dy (CervISA) 
in women with advanced HPV16 positive cervical cancer. This study evaluated the safety, 
tolerability, immune responses, and clinical outcomes of ISA101/101b given in sequence with 
carboplatin and paclitaxel in women with HPV16 positive advance d cervical cancer. The 
maximum treatment duration was six 21 -day cycles of carboplatin and paclitaxel (total 18 weeks) 
if there were no dose interruptions or delays. On day 15 (± 3 days) of cycles 2, 3, and 4, patients 
were vaccinated with ISA101 without o r with pegylated IFNα (depending on cohort assignment). 
The patients were vaccinated with a fixed dose of ISA101/101b every 3 weeks (Q3W) for a total 
of 3 vaccinations. The enrollment in the CervISA study has been completed, including 72 patients 
that rece ived ISA101 vaccination at a dose level of up to 300 μg/peptide. In addition, in a bridging 
cohort, 12 patients received ISA101b vaccination at the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of 
100 μg/peptide without or with bevacizumab.  
Administration of ISA101/101b induced potent, specific, and durable immune responses to 
HPV16 epitopes. The HPV16 immune response was minimal at baseline and after the first cycle 
of chemotherapy, before the first dose of ISA101. After 2 or 3 doses of vaccination with ISA10 1, 
the HPV16 -specific immune response was substantially increased, particularly at the 40  and 
100 μg/peptide dose levels. A further increase in the HPV16 -specific T -cell immune response was 
not observed at the 300 μg/peptide dose level. Though only measure d in 9 patients in each of the 
expansion cohorts vaccinated with the 40 and 100 μg/ peptide doses, the HPV -specific response 
appeared to be durable and was sustained for several months after the first vaccination.   
The T -cell response against common micro bial recall antigens (memory mix, MRM) not present 
in the vaccine showed that these immune responses increased following the first 2 cycles of 
chemotherapy but was unaffected by administration of ISA101.  
An increase in OS was associated with the strength o f the vaccine -induced HPV16 T -cell response 
to ISA101. ISA101/101b was generally well tolerated. The most common associated adverse 
events (AEs) were grade 1 or 2 local injection site reactions (ISRs). The ISRs were dose related 
and observed in approximate ly 85 to 90% of the patients who received the RP2D of 
100 μg/peptide. In addition, systemic allergic reactions were observed, particularly in patients 
receiving ISA101 at the 300 μg/peptide dose level. No clinically important overlapping toxicities 
of ISA1 01/ISA101b were identified with chemotherapy (paclitaxel and carboplatin).  
Additional information on this study is provided in the ISA101b Investigator’s Brochure.

 CONFIDENTIAL  Study ISA101 -MDACC in Patients with HPV16 Positive Tumors  
Study ISA101 -MDACC was an investi gator -sponsored study at the MD Anderson Cancer Center 
(MDACC), designed to evaluate the overall response rate of patients with recurrent/metastatic 
incurable HPV16 positive malignancies after ISA101 vaccination in combination with the PD -1 
inhibitor nivol umab. Patients in this study had tumors with a confirmed HPV16 genotype as judged 
by Cervista HPV16/18. Patients had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) 
performance status 0 to 1 and could have had up to 1 prior regimen for recurrence. ISA101 100 
μg/peptide was given SC on days 1, 22, and 50. Nivolumab 3 mg/kg was given intravenously (IV) 
every 2 weeks beginning on day 8 for up to 1  year.  
The trial was completed in January 2017 after accruing 24 patients in 1 year; 22 with oropharyngeal 
carcinoma ( OPC) and 1 patient each with anal and cervical cancer. Eighteen patients (75%) had 
progression within 6 months of prior platinum therapy and 1 was platinum -naïve. Twelve patients 
(50%) had prior cetuximab treatment. Study treatment was frontline for recurr ence in 10/24 and 
second -line in 14/24. The patients with anal or cervical cancer did not show objective tumor 
regression, but 1 had stable disease (SD).   
The overall response rate in the 24 patients overall was 8/24 (33%), and in the subset with OPC 
8/22 (36%). There were 2 (9%) complete responders (CR), 6 (27%) partial responders (PR), 2 
(9%) patients with SD, and 12 (55%) patients with progressive disease (PD). As of 01 Sep 2017, 
5 of 8 patients with response remained without progression with median dur ation of response 
(DOR) 10.3 months (95% CI: 10.3 – inestimable). Of these 8 patients, all had OPC, 6 had 
progressed within 6 months of prior platinum therapy, 1 was platinum -naïve, 6 had prior 
cetuximab, 5 had progressed within 6 months of cetuximab, and 4 were treated in second -line. 
Toxicity included grade 3 transaminase and grade 4 lipase elevation in 1 patient each. Grade 1 to 
2 toxicity included fever (5 patients); injection site reaction (6 patients); and transaminase 
elevation, fatigue, nausea (3 pa tients each) (Massarelli, 2019 ). 
ISA101 was generally well tolerated in patients with HPV16 positive cancers, including OPC, and 
there did not appear to be overlapping toxicities with nivolumab. Based on its composition and 
clinical data, the safety, tolerability, and immune responses o f ISA101b are comparable to ISA101. 
Additional details are provided in the ISA101b Investigator’s Brochure.  
1.3.3.  Safety Profile  
Clinical experience in approximately 100 patients who have received ISA101 indicates that the 
most common AEs associated with ISA101 are local ISRs. The ISRs were dose related and 
observed in approximately 90% of the patients who received the RP2D of 100 μg/peptide. In 
addition, systemic allergic reactions have been observed, particularly in patients receiving higher 
doses of 300 μg/pep tide (33%) compared to <5% at the 100 μg/peptide dose.  
Based on its composition and initial clinical data, ISA101b appears to have a comparable safety 
profile to ISA101. The available safety data with ISA101b indicate that it has an acceptable safety 
profile for use at 100 μg/peptide. The most frequent toxicities are local ISRs (predominantly 
grade  1 to 2). Systemic allergic reactions are potentially the most serious adverse reactions to 
ISA101/ISA101b.

 CONFIDENTIAL  No overlapping toxicities of ISA101/ISA101b with eit her chemotherapy (paclitaxel and 
carboplatin) or anti -PD-1 therapy (nivolumab) have been detected. No autoimmune AEs have been 
reported in relationship to HPV -16-SLP, ISA101 or ISA101b. Immune -mediated treatment -
emergent adverse events (TEAEs) have been re ported with anti -PD-1 antibodies. For further 
information on ISA101b regarding appropriate recommendations and precautions, refer to the 
ISA101b Investigator’s Brochure.  
1.3.4.  Pharmacokinetics  
The pharmacokinetic (PK) characteristics of ISA101/ISA101b have not been studied since the PK 
of a vaccine is not considered clinically relevant and does not correlate with its pharmacodynamic 
or immunologic actions. Pharmacodynamic effects are best assessed by the immunogenicity 
studies that have been incorporated in the clinical studies.  
Furthermore, ISA101/ISA101b is not metabolized in the conventional sense: the long peptides are 
taken up by antigen presenting cells (APCs), which process them to smaller peptides, called T -cell 
epitopes, which are then presented in HLA m olecules on the surface of the APC. In the meantime, 
the APC traffics to a draining lymph node, where naive T cells recognize the presented T -cell 
epitopes and are activated by these epitopes. The peptides are processed within APCs through the 
standard HLA  class I and II processing pathways.

 CONFIDENTIAL  3. HYPOTHESIS AND RATIO NALE  
3.1. Hypothesis  
In recurrent/metasta tic HPV16 cervical cancer patients who have progressed on or after first line 
chemotherapy in the recurrent or metastatic setting, cemiplimab  + ISA101b will lead to durable 
objective responses in a clinically meaningful proportion of patients, and these wi ll be associated 
with the production of increased anti -HPV16 E6/E7 effector T -cell responses.  
3.2. Rationale  
3.2.1.  Rationale for Study Design  
Unmet medical need in cervical cancer after progression on first line chemotherapy  
For women with recurrent or metastatic ce rvical cancer, the GOG240 study established that 
standard first line therapy is platinum plus taxane doublet with the addition of bevacizumab if 
clinically appropriate. Median survival with the triplet regimen is 17 months (Tewari, 2017 ). After 
progression on first line platinum -taxane based chemotherapy for recurrent or metastatic disease, 
the efficacy of cytotoxic chemotherapy is low with an approximate median survival of 7 months.   
Study of immunotherapeutic approaches in cervical cancer is of interest due to the presence of 
HPV viral antigen in virtually all tumors. Blockade of the PD -1 immune checkpoint with 
pembrolizumab achieved objective responses in 12% (12/98) of patients with recurrent/metastatic 
cervical cancer (Chung, 2019 ). In the subset of patients with PD -L1 positive  tumors (CPS ≥1%), 
ORR was 14.6% (12/82). These observations led the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to 
grant accelerated ap proval for pembrolizumab for the treatment of this subgroup of patients. A 
randomized phase 3 trial of cemiplimab versus chemotherapy will determine if PD -1 blockade 
improves overall survival in second line (or greater) cervical cancer patients (NCT0325726 7). 
Cemiplimab is also being explored in monotherapy and combination therapy in a variety of solid 
and liquid tumor types. Cemiplimab received regulatory approval for advanced cutaneous 
squamous cell carcinoma with an overall ORR of 47.2% ( Cemiplimab Inves tigator’s Brochure ). 
Generating HPV -specific T cells with ISA101b synthetic long peptide vaccine is a research 
strategy to achieve anti -tumor immune responses. However, vaccination alone of advanced stage 
cervical cancer patients did not achieve clinical b enefit (Welters, 2018 ), possibly due to 
intratumoral expression  of inhibitory immune molecules such as PD -L1. This possibility is 
supported by the results of a phase 2 study of nivolumab + ISA101 in 22 patients with OPC (and  2 
others, of which, 1 had cervical cancer), in which the observed ORR of 33% is greater than t hat 
which would be expected with PD -1 blockade alone (Massarelli, 2019 ). 
Combinatorial approaches to stimulate convergent aspects of host immunity by employing 
complementary immunomodulators, as well as, immune -stimulatory aspects of conventional 
modalities, may result in the development of more effective cancer therapies. Trea tment with the 
PD-1 inhibitor pembrolizumab has shown initial efficacy as monotherapy in recurrent or metastatic 
cervical cancer after disease progression on or after chemotherapy (FDA, 2018 ). In order to 
achieve higher and longer duration of responses and survival, however, combining anti -PD-1 mAb 
treatment with novel immunotherapy approaches will be required. In addition , while initial d ata 
obtained with ISA101 indicated that a robust and clinically active immune responses against 
                                        VV-RIM-00164906-1.0 Approved - 31 Aug 2021 GMT-5:00

 CONFIDENTIAL  HPV16 E6/E7 could be obtained in HPV16 positive patients with pre -malignant lesions, such as 
vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN) (Kenter, 2009 ), patients with advanced malignancies are 
known to have a variety of mechani sms that limit the  immune response, including changes in the 
local tumor microenvironment. In order to observe robust and clinically active immune responses 
in patients with advanced cervical cancer, the HPV16 vaccine will need to be combined with one 
or m ore immune -modulatory strategies to overcome the tumor -induced local and generalized 
immunosuppression. Encouraging results using ISA101/ISA101b have been observed in a single 
arm study (CervISA) in women with advanced HPV16 positive cervical cancer.  
Study ISA101 -MDACC was an investigator -initiated study at the MD Anderson Cancer Center 
(MDACC), which was designed to evaluate the ORR of ISA101 vaccination in combination with 
the PD -1 inhibitor, nivolumab, in patients with recurrent/ metastatic incurabl e HPV16 positive 
malignancies. The primary objective was assessment of overall clinical response rate targeting 
30% using a Simon 2 -stage MiniMax design. This was based on an estimated overall clinical 
response rate of approximately 20% with nivolumab alon e in patients with recurrent p16+ 
oropharynx cancer. Secondary objectives included tolerability, PFS, OS, and HPV -specific 
immune response.  
This study showed that ISA101 increases the overall clinical response rate in metastatic HPV16 
positive OPC patient s when administered in combination with nivolumab (33%) 
(Massarelli,  2019 ) compared to historical controls (Ferris, 2016 ), which was coupled to an 
approximate doubling of the expected median OS of these patients. This suggests that the efficacy 
of anti -PD-1 therapy may be enhanced by the addition of an HPV16 specific therapeutic cancer 
vaccine such as ISA101(b). The combination of stimu lating  the HPV16 specific immune response, 
while mitigating the impact of the immunosuppressive microenvironment, appears to be a 
promising strategy that warrants further evaluation.  
To confirm and extend these results, a randomized phase 2 study is ongoin g to compare 
cemiplimab + ISA101b versus cemiplimab in patients with recurrent/metastatic HPV16 
Oropharyngeal Cancer (OPC) (ISA101b -HN-01-17). Approximately 194 patients will be enrolled, 
and the primary endpoint is ORR.  
The current study seeks to address  the unmet need in recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer 
patients who have progressed on first line chemotherapy.  
3.2.2.  Rationale for Dose Selection  
The dose and schedule for both ISA101b and cemiplimab are the same as in the phase 2 study 
ISA101b -HN-01-17. Th e dose of cemiplimab 350  mg Q3W is consistent with cemiplimab dosing 
in solid tumor development.

3.3.1.  Patient Screening and Site Initiation in Response to COVID -19 
Recognizing that the “Coronavirus Disease 2019” (COVID -19) pandemic will have an imp act on 
the conduct of clinical trials, the Sponsor does not intend to screen any patients in this study until 
the impact of the COVID -19 pandemic is deemed manageable and no longer interfering with the 
conduct of trials at individual sites, and patients ca n safely participate in this study. Until then, the

3.3.1.1.  COVID -19 Vaccination During the St udy  
It is recommended for patients to complete COVID -19 vaccination at least 14 days prior to 
receiving the first dose of ISA101b or to delay COVID -19 vaccination until at least 14 days after 
the final dose of ISA101b.

3.3.2.  Risk -Benefit for Cemiplimab  
3.3.2.1.  Benefit for Cemiplimab  
Cemiplimab is a fully human monoclonal  antibody against PD -1 and is currently being evaluated 
in patients with advanced solid malignancies and B -cell lymphomas whose cancers are incurable 
and/or have failed to respond to or showed tumor progression despite standard therapy, or patients 
who are  not candidates for standard therapy, or for whom no available therapy is expected to 
convey clinical benefit. Cemiplimab has demonstrated efficacy (based on ORR and DOR) and is 
approved in the US for patients with advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinom a (CSCC), 
locally advanced basal cell carcinoma, and as a first -line treatment option in advanced non -small 
cell lung cancer.  
As described in earlier sections, antibodies to PD -1/PDL -1 have been shown to be effective 
therapeutic options for metastatic cerv ical cancer. Cemiplimab is currently being evaluated in a 
phase 3 randomized study for survival benefit over chemotherapy. The potential benefit for 
patients includes increased response rate, longer duration of response, avoidance of risks 
associated with chemotherapy and increased survival.  
3.3.2.2.  Risk for Cemiplimab  
To mitigate this risk, tumor assessments are performed after every 2 doses of cemiplimab for the 
first 4 cycles. Subsequent cycles will have tumor assessments after every 3 doses of cemiplimab. 
Tumor  assessments are designed to allow patients to pursue other treatment plans if clinically 
indicated.  
The safety profile of cemiplimab is similar to the safety profile of other anti -PD-1/PD -L1. The 
important identified risks are immune -mediated adverse even ts (imAEs) and infusion -related 
reactions (IRRs). The mitigation strategies for these risks are described in Section  8.2.3.1  through 
Section  8.3.1 . 
More detailed information about the known and expected risks and reasonably expected AEs of 
cemiplimab may be found in the most recent approved version o f the Investigator’s Brochures.  
3.3.2.3.  Benefit:Risk for Cemiplimab  
Based on the currently available safety information for cemiplimab, safety information from other 
anti-PD-1 antibodies, the adequate risk identification and minimization described in the 
Investigator’s Brochure/protocols/informed consent forms (ICFs), the emerging preliminary 
                                        VV-RIM-00164906-1.0 Approved - 31 Aug 2021 GMT-5:00

 CONFIDENTIAL  activity of cemiplimab on solid malignancies (including CSCC, non -small cell lung cancer 
[NSCLC] and cervical), the benefit -risk is considered favorable for continued  clinical studies in 
these and other indications.  
3.3.3.  Risk -Benefit for ISA101b  
3.3.3.1.  Benefit of ISA101b  
ISA101b is designed as a therapeutic vaccine, which targets distinct human pathogenic viral 
antigens and triggers a highly human -specific immune response. The inv olved 
immunostimulatory/ immunomodulatory effects (eg, cascades of involved chemokines/cytokines 
and cells of the immune system but also organ and target antigen structures), but also the HPV 
induced effects/target structures are highly human specific.  
As described in earlier sections, ISA101b and its precursor have been shown to initiate and/or 
stimulate an HPV16 specific immune response in patients with HPV16 induced lesions. This was 
specifically evident in patients with HPV16 metastatic cervical cancer . A pilot study with 
combination of ISA101b showed an increased response rate and overall survival. Therefore, the 
potential benefits for patients receiving ISA101b include increased response rate, longer duration 
of response, avoidance of risks associated  with chemotherapy and increased survival.  
3.3.3.2.  Risk of ISA101b  
The fundamental risk is a lack of response. To mitigate this risk, patients will undergo frequent 
tumor assessments. This will allow patients to pursue other treatment plans.  
As with all immunomodulation agents, the TEAEs of interest are local and systemic immune -
mediated AEs. Local ISRs are detailed in Section  8.3.1.3 . ImAEs and IRRs  are detailed in 
Section  8.2.3  and Section  8.3.1 . 
More detailed information about the known and expected risks and reasonably expected AEs of 
ISA101b may be found in the most recent approved version of the Investigator’s Brochures.  
3.3.3.3.  Benefit:Risk for Cemiplimab/ISA101b Combination  
The combination of IS A101b and cemiplimab in this study is expected to have a positive 
benefit -risk profile for the treatment of patients with HPV16 positive cervical cancer. Anti -PD1 
inhibitors given as monotherapy have shown activity and a well -established acceptable toxicit y 
profile in recurrent/metastatic cervical cancer patients. ISA101b has been demonstrated to induce 
a robust and persistent T -cell response in patients with HPV16 driven malignancies, including 
cervical cancer and OPC. The combination of ISA101b with the a nti-PD1 nivolumab achieved 
higher response rates compared to a historical control of nivolumab alone in the treatment of 
HPV16 positive OPC, albeit in a small number of patients with heterogeneous prior therapy. 
Finally, the combination of ISA101 with nivo lumab has shown no unexpected toxicities in patients 
with OPC (Massarelli, 2019 ). 
Since HPV -positive OPC patients with recurrent cancer routinel y receive checkpoint inhibitors in 
first or second -line treatment, the use of cemiplimab as the treatment backbone is acceptable in 
order to objectively test the hypothesis of improved efficacy with the addition of ISA101b to an 
anti-PD-1 inhibitor in HPV -driven malignancies.

 CONFIDENTIAL  6. STUDY DESIGN  
6.1. Study Description and Duration  
This will be a single -arm, phase 2, global study of treatment with cemiplimab + ISA101b in 
HPV16 -positive cervical cancer patients with disease progression on first line chemotherapy in the 
recurrent or metastatic setting. Study treatment and duration include cemiplimab every 3  weeks 
(with 3 doses of ISA101b on days 1, 29, and 50) until progression or any reason for early 
discontinuation as outlined in Section  7.3 and Section  8.2.2 . 
Patients will undergo screening evaluations to determine eligibility within 28 days prior to first 
treatment. All patients will receive the following regimen:  
• ISA101b 100 μg/peptide by SC injection on day 1, day 29, and day 50 (total of 3  doses).  
• Cemiplimab 350 mg given by IV infusion over 30 minutes Q3W on days 8 and 29 in 
cycle 1, on days 1 and 22 in cycles 2 through 4, and on days 1, 22, and 43 in all 
subsequent cycles or until disease progression or discontinuation of study drug  for any 
other r eason.  
Note:  On days 29 and 50, cemiplimab will be administered first, and ISA101b will be 
administered approximately 1 hour after the end of the cemiplimab infusion. Patients 
must be observed for 4 hours after each ISA101b administration.  
The timing of d oses is summarized in Figure  2. Cycle 1 will be 7 weeks long, cycles 2 through 4 
will be 6 weeks long, and all subsequent cycles will be 9 weeks long.  
Patients will be assessed for response at cycle 1 day 50 (week 7), then once per cycle (every 
6 weeks for 3 cycles, then every 9 weeks in all subsequent cycles or until disease progression or 
discontinuation of study drug for any other reason; Section  8.8, Section  8.2.2 , and Section  7.3, 
respectively ). Patients with confirmed CR after a minimum of 48 weeks of treatment may elect to 
discontinue treatment and continue with all relevant study assess ments (eg, efficacy assessments).  
There will be a 90 -day safety follow -up after the last dose of cemiplimab. Patients who discontinue 
study drug for reasons other than progression will be followed approximately every 4  months by 
scans until disease progression or until the patient commences another anticancer systemic therapy, 
whichever comes first. After progression, survival follow -up should occur approximately every 
4 months.  
The total duration of study from start of screening to final analysis of  OS is expected to be 
approximately 36 months (approximately 12 months of accrual, approximately 12 months of 
treatment, and approximately 12 months of follow up).

 CONFIDENTIAL  19. Has any medical condition, co -morbidity, physical examination finding, or metabolic 
dysfunction, or clinical laboratory abnormality that, in the opinion of the investigator, 
renders the patient unsuitable for participation in a clinical trial due to high safet y risks 
and/or potential to affect interpretation of results of the study  
20. Member of the clinical site study team or his/her immediate family, unless prior approval 
granted by the sponsor.  
21. Patients with a positive serum/urine hCG pregnancy test must have pr egnancy medically 
ruled out to be eligible for study. Breastfeeding women are also excluded.  
22. Continued sexual activity in women of childbearing potential (WOCBP)*, or sexually 
active men, who are unwilling to practice highly effective contraception prior t o the initial 
dose/start of the first treatment, during the study, and for at least 6 months after the last 
dose. Highly effective contraceptive measures include:  
a. stable use of combined (estrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception 
(oral, i ntravaginal, transdermal) or progestogen -only hormonal contraception (oral, 
injectable, implantable) associated with inhibition of ovulation initiated 2 or more 
menstrual cycles prior to screening  
b. intrauterine device (IUD); intrauterine hormone releasing system (IUS);  
c. bilateral tubal ligation  
d. vasectomized partner (provided that the male vasectomized partner is the sole sexual 
partner of the WOCBP study participant and that the vasectomized partner has obtained 
medical assessment of surgical success for t he procedure)  
e. and/or sexual abstinence†,‡.  
* WOCBP are defined as women who are fertile following menarche until becoming 
postmenopausal, unless permanently sterile.  Permanent sterilization methods include 
hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy, and bila teral oophorectomy.  
A postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 months without an alternative 
medical cause. A high follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level in the postmenopausal 
range may be used to confirm a postmenopausal state in women not us ing hormonal 
contraception or hormonal replacement therapy. However, in the absence of 12 months of 
amenorrhea, a single FSH measurement is insufficient to determine the occurrence of a 
postmenopausal state. The above definitions are according to Clinical Trial Facilitation 
Group (CTFG) guidance. Pregnancy testing and contraception are not required for women 
with documented hysterectomy or tubal ligation.  
† Sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if defined as 
refraining from heterose xual intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the 
study drugs. The reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the 
duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient.  
‡ Periodic  abstinence (calendar, symptothermal, post -ovulation methods), 
withdrawal (coitus interruptus), spermicides only, and lactational amenorrhoea method 
(LAM) are not acceptable methods of contraception. Female condom and male condom 
should not be used togethe r.

 CONFIDENTIAL  8. STUDY TREATMENTS  
8.1. Investigational and Reference Treatments  
ISA101b is an investigational treatment. Cemiplimab is being used as an investigational treatment 
for ce rvical cancer and is approved for the treatment for advanced cutaneous squamous cell cancer 
(CSCC), locally advanced basal cell carcinoma, and as a first -line treatment option in advanced 
non-small cell lung cancer.  
Additional information regarding cemipl imab and ISA101b is provided in the respective 
Investigator’s Brochures.  
8.1.1.  Cemiplimab  
Cemiplimab (REGN2810) is supplied as a liquid in sterile, single use vials. Cemiplimab will be 
administered IV at a dose of 350  mg over 30 minutes (±10 minutes) Q3W.  
8.1.2.  ISA101 b 
The study drug product ISA101b is provided in 2 vials, HPV -DP-5P containing 5 peptides and 
HPV -DP-7P containing 7 peptides. Bulk preparation, sterile filtration, filling, and lyophilization 
have been developed for each drug product. ISA101b 100 µg/peptid e will be administered by SC 
injections.  ISA101b is not provided or prepared as an individual product.  Two discrete injections, 
one of HPV -DP-5P and one of HPV -DP-7P, together in vivo  constitute ISA101b.  
Instructions on dose preparation are provided in t he pharmacy manual.  
8.2. Dose Modification and Study Treatment Discontinuation Rules  
8.2.1.  Dose Modification  
Dose modification of cemiplimab for an individual patient is not allowed.  
If cemiplimab is delayed, interrupted, or discontinued due to toxicity clearly rela ted to cemiplimab 
as described in the cemiplimab Investigator’s Brochure, and this toxicity is not considered related 
to ISA101b, the remaining doses of ISA101b may be administered. It is recommended to discuss 
such cases with the Medical Monitor.  
If ISA10 1b is delayed, interrupted, or discontinued due to toxicity clearly related to ISA101b as 
described in the ISA101b Investigator’s Brochure, and this toxicity is not considered related to 
cemiplimab, the remaining doses of cemiplimab may be administered. It  is recommended to 
discuss such cases with the Medical Monitor.  
There will be no dose reduction for ISA101b in this study.  
8.2.2.  Study Drug Discontinuation  
Patients who permanently discontinue from study drug due to disease progression, toxicity, or 
another reas on who do not withdraw consent from study participation will be asked to return to 
the clinic for all remaining study visits per the visit schedule ( Table  2) and will be expected to 
continue with safety follow -up assessments.

 CONFIDENTIAL  8.2.2.1.  Reasons for Permanent Discontinuation of Study Drug  
Study drug (cemiplimab and/or ISA101b) will be permanently stopped in the event of:  
• Serious or severe allergic reactions considered related to study drug  
• Grade 3 infusion related reaction  
• Grade 3 uveitis  
• Grade 3 or 4 neurologic toxicity  
• Grade 3 or 4 myocarditis/pericarditis  
• Any grade 4 non -hematologic toxicity except for clinically insignificant laboratory 
abnormalities  
• Any non -hematologic toxicity that led to temporary withholding of study treatment 
which does not resolve to grade 1 or baseline within 12 weeks of last study drug 
infusion except for immune -mediated endocri nopathies controlled with hormonal 
therapy  
• Grade 4 hematologic toxicity that does not resolve to less than grade 4 within 2  weeks 
of last infusion or to grade 2 (neutropenia) or grade 1 or baseline (others) within 
12 weeks of last study drug infusion.  
• Phys ician/patient decision  
• Treatment delay of ≥84 consecutive days from last dose of study drug  
8.2.2.2.  Reasons for Temporary Discontinuation of Study Drug  
Study treatment may be temporarily stopped due to events that meet the criteria for treatment 
interruption descr ibed in Section  8.2.3  (and Appendix  2) or Section  8.3. 
8.2.3.  Immune -Mediated Adverse Events  
8.2.3.1.  Identification of Immune -mediated Adverse Events  
Investigators must be extremely vigilant and be ready to intervene early in the management of 
imAEs, as the onset of symptoms of imAEs (eg, pneumonitis) may be subtle. An imAE can occur 
at any time during treatment or several months after the last dose of treatment. All AEs of unknown 
etiology associated with st udy drug exposure should be evaluated to determine possible immune 
etiology. If an imAE is suspected, efforts should be made to rule out neoplastic, infectious, 
metabolic, toxin or other etiologic causes prior to labeling an AE as an imAE.  
Based on the eme rging safety profile of cemiplimab and other antibodies targeting the PD -1/PD -
L1 axis, working case definitions are provided in the Investigator’s Brochure to help investigators 
distinguish imAEs from non -immune AEs commonly associated with PD -1 inhibition  
(Naidoo,  2015 ), (Weber, 2015 ). This is not exhaustive of all possible imAEs. Clinical 
presentations of l ess common imAEs, including neurologic, musculoskeletal, cardiac, renal, and 
ocular events (Hofmann, 2016 ), (Zimmer, 2016 ), should be reviewed in patients with concerning 
presentations.

Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.   Page 48 
 CONFIDENTIAL  The case definitions in the Investigator’s Brochure have not been validated and are intended only 
as guidance for investigators to help distinguish imAEs from non -immune AEs. These definitions 
may evolve as clinical experience increases with cemiplimab and other antibodies targeting the 
PD-1/PD -L1 axis. Investigators’ clinical judgment may include other factors when determining if 
an AE is immune -mediated.  
8.2.3.2.  Management of Immune -Mediated Adverse Events  
Adverse events that meet the criteria for imAEs, as noted above in the Investigator’s Brochure, 
should be reported as imAEs in the eCRF. If AEs corresponding to the common terms for imAEs 
are attributed as NOT related to c emiplimab by the investigator, additional information should be 
provided to substantiate an alternative attribution (eg, infectious diarrhea).   
If not provided at the outset, this information may be requested by immediate edit checks or in 
subsequent quer ies.  The sponsor may request additional information for any AE that is of a type 
known to be potentially immune -mediated (eg, rash, colitis, elevated transaminases, endocrine 
events), but is deemed not an imAE by the investigator.  
Any grade 3 or greater i mAE should be reported as an AESI (Section  10.2.3 ). 
The following general principles apply to management of imAEs, unless otherwise specified in 
Appendix  2: 
Grade 1 :  Continue study treatment with close monitoring and provide symptomatic management  
Grade 2:   Consider withholding study treatment  
Grade 3:   Withhold study treatment  
Grade 4:   Discontinue study treatment  
If cemiplimab is held for ≤ grade  3 imAE, consider resuming when symptoms and/or laboratory 
values revert to baseline or ≤ grade  1 after corticosteroid taper (typically, to ≤10  mg/day  
prednisone or equivalent).  
Permanently discontinue study treatment for:  
• Recurrent grade  3 imAEs   
• Grade ≥3 or recurrent grade 2 Pneumonitis  
• Grade ≥3 Hepatitis with AST/ALT >5×ULN or total bilirubin >3×ULN  
• Grade ≥3 Nephritis with renal dysfunction  
• Grade ≥3 Uveitis  
• Grade ≥3 Neurologic toxicity  
• Grade ≥3 Myocarditis or pericarditis  
• Grade ≥3 Infusion related reaction  
• Confirmed Stevens -Johnson syndrome ( SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis ( TEN ), or 
drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms  (DRESS )

 CONFIDENTIAL  • Grade ≥3 or recurrent grade 2 imAEs in patients previously treated with idelalisib  
• Grade ≥3 infusion -related reaction  
• Grade  2 or 3 imAEs persistent for ≥12  weeks after the last study treatment (excluding 
endocrinopathies  
• Requirement for ≥10  mg per day prednis one or equivalent lasting ≥12  weeks after the 
last study treatment  
Further guidance regarding management of selected imAEs is provided in Appendix  2. Additional 
information about the safety profile of cemiplimab is in the Investigators Brochure . Expert 
consensus guidelines that provide guidance managing less common imAEs are available and may 
be updated periodically (Brahmer, 2018 ) (Haanen, 2017 ) (Puzanov, 2017 ) (Thompson,  2018 ).  
The management considerations provided here should not supersede clinical judgment in the 
setting of an individual patient.  The investigator may choose to hold study treatment at his/her 
clinical judgment regarding the safety of an individual patient, even if hold criteria are not formally 
met per protocol.   
Any patient currently receiving cemiplimab who  was previously treated with a 
phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase (PI3K) inhibitor and who develops stomatitis or mucositis should 
temporarily suspend study treatment. If this or any other imAE occurs among these patients, the 
sponsor should be informed as soon  as possible to discuss further management of the patient. An 
imAE of any grade in a patient previously treated with a PI3K inhibitor should be reported as an 
AESI.  
8.2.4.  General Guidance for Management of Adverse Events  
This subsection provides general guidance  of treatment -related AEs ( Table  1) that are not 
specifically addressed in guidelines for management of imAEs ( Section  8.2.3.2  or Appendix  2) or 
in management of acute infusion reactions ( Section  8.3). In the event of discrepancy between this 
section and a section that provides for detailed guidance (ie, Section  8.2.3.2 , Appendix  2 or 
Section  8.3), the section that provides the more detailed guidance will supersede th e general 
guidance in this section.

Treatment after an AE may resume at the discretion of the investigator if it is in accordance with 
the toxicity management guidelines in this protocol, if resumption of treatment is thought to be in 
the best interest of the patient and if either of the following conditions are met: 
• After resolution of an AE to ≤  grade  1 (or baseline)  
• The AE is considered to be manageable through supportive/medical therapy (eg, 
grade  3 hypertension that can be controlled with the addition of a second 
anti-hypertensive agent).  
8.3. Management of Acut e Reactions  
8.3.1.  Acute Intravenous Infusion Reactions  
Infusion -related reactions (IRRs) are known to occur with infusions of therapeutic proteins and 
have been observed in cemiplimab studies.  To assist investigators in identifying IRRs, the 
following case definition is provided:  
• Typical symptoms may include fever, chills, rigors, skin flushing, dyspnea, back pain, 
abdominal pain, and nausea  
• Infusion reactions usually occur either during the infusion or within 24  hours after the 
infusion is completed  
• Vital signs may be notable for hypotension and/or tachycardia  
• Signs and symptoms generally resolve completely within 24  hours of onset   
The investigator’s clinical judgment may include other factors when evaluating a possible IRR.

Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.   Page 51 
 CONFIDENTIAL  See the Investigator’s Brochu re for further information about IRRs with cemiplimab.  Such 
reactions may also be referred to as systemic hypersensitivity reactions.  
Emergency equipment and medication for the treatment of infusion reactions must be available for 
immediate use.  All infu sion reactions must be reported as AEs (as defined in Section  10.2.4 ) and 
graded using the grading scales as instructed in Section  10.2.5 . 
In the event of an infusion reaction of ≥ grade  3 severity during or directly following infusion of 
cemiplimab, dosing should be stopped, and the patient must  be permanently discontinued from 
study treatment.  
Case report forms must capture start and stop time of the event, signs and symptoms, and 
management interventions (medications, interruption of infusion, rate reduction).  
8.3.1.1.  Interruption of the Intravenous In fusion  
The infusion should be interrupted if any of the following AEs are observed:  
• Sustained/severe cough  
• Rigors/chills  
• Rash, pruritus (itching)  
• Urticaria (hives, welts, wheals)  
• Diaphoresis (sweating)  
• Hypotension  
• Dyspnea (shortness of breath)  
• Vomiting  
• Flushing  
The reaction(s) should be treated symptomatically, and the infusion may be restarted at 50% of the 
original rate once symptoms resolve.  
If investigators feel there is a medical need for treatment or discontinuation of the infusion other 
than describe d above, they should use clinical judgment to provide the appropriate response 
according to typical clinical practice.  
For patients who experience infusion -related hypersensitivity reactions that are ≤grade  2 during 
infusion, infusion should be interrupted  or infusion rate reduced. For those who plan to continue 
treatment, premedication listed below are recommended for re -treatment.  
For grade  1 symptoms  (mild reaction; infusion interruption not indicated; intervention not 
indicated), the following prophylac tic medications are recommended for future infusions:  
diphenhydramine 50  mg (or equivalent) and/or acetaminophen/paracetamol 325  mg to 1000  mg at 
least 30  minutes prior to subsequent study treatment infusions.  
For grade  2 symptoms  (moderate reaction that requires therapy or infusion interruption, but for 
which symptoms resolve promptly with appropriate treatment such as antihistamines, nonsteroidal 
anti-inflammatory drugs, narcotics, corticosteroids, and/or IV fluids; prophylactic medications

infusions:  diphenhydramine 50  mg (or equivalent) and/or acetaminophen/paracetamol 325  mg to 
1000  mg at least 30  minutes prior to subsequent study treatment infusions.  If necess ary, 
corticosteroids (up to 25  mg of hydrocortisone or equivalent) may be used.  
8.3.1.2.  Termination of the Intravenous Infusion  
The infusion should be terminated and NOT restarted if any of the following AEs occur:  
• Anaphylaxis*  
• Laryngeal/pharyngeal edema  
• Severe bronchospasm  
• Chest pain  
• Seizure  
• Severe hypotension  
• Other neurological symptoms (confusion, loss of consciousness, paresthesia, 
paralysis, etc.)  
• Any other symptom or sign that, in the opinion of the investigator, warrants 
termination of the IV infusion  
*Consider anaphylaxis if the following is observed (Sampson, 2006 ):  acute  onset of an illness 
(minutes to several hours) with involvement of the skin, mucosal tissue, or both (eg, generalized 
hives, pruritus or ﬂushing, swollen lips -tongue -uvula) AND AT LEAST ONE OF  THE 
FOLLOWING  
• Respiratory compromise (eg, dyspnea, wheeze -bronchospasm, stridor, reduced peak 
expiratory flow, hypoxemia)  
• Reduced BP or associated symptoms of end -organ dysfunction (eg, hypotonia 
[collapse], syncope, incontinence)  
8.3.1.3.  Local Injection Site Re actions  
Local ISRs must be reported as AEs and graded according to Section  10.2.5 . 
8.3.1.3.1.  Management of ISA101b -Specific Adverse Events  
ISA101b will be disc ontinued for any severe (≥ grade 3) ISR. Severity will be graded according 
to Section  10.2.5 . 
ISA101b administration should be delayed for the follo wing:  
• Any ≥ grade 3 ISA101b -related AE.  
• Temperature >38°C over the last 24 hours prior to administration.  
• Any AE, laboratory abnormality, or intercurrent illness which, in the judgment of the 
investigator, warrants delaying the dose of ISA101b.

 CONFIDENTIAL  The occurrence of an ISA101b -associated systemic allergic reaction will be managed according 
to standard practice, including close observation, antihistamines, and fluids, as well as steroids or 
epinephrine if clinically indicated. ISA101b should not be admin istered again following resolution 
of a grade 4 systemic allergic reaction. Refer to the ISA101b Investigator’s Brochure for details.  
Local ISR at site(s) of previous administration of ISA101b of > grade 3 should be treated 
symptomatically and followed unt il resolution to grade 1 is observed.  
Patients may resume treatment with the next dose of ISA101b when study drug -related AEs 
resolve to grade ≤1 or baseline value, with the following exception: patients may resume treatment 
in the presence of grade 2 fati gue.  
If day 29 of ISA101b is missed, the second dose of ISA101b will be given on day 45 (±3 days) 
and the third dose will be given on day 66 (±3 days). If day 29 was missed due to an AE or lab 
abnormality, this must have resolved prior to resumption of do sing.  
If day 50 of ISA101b is missed, the third dose of ISA101b will be given on day 66 (±3 days). If 
day 50 was missed due to an AE or lab abnormality, this must have resolved prior to resumption 
of dosing.  
8.4. Method of Treatment Assignment

 CONFIDENTIAL  concomitant treatment. This includes medications and other therapies for which administration 
started 30 days before the first dose of the study drug and will continue during the study, as well 
as any therapies started in the follow -up period to treat a study -drug-related AE. All concomitant 
treatments must be recorded in the study eCRF with the generic name, dose, dose unit, frequency, 
indication, and start/stop date, as appropriate.  
8.7.1.  Prohibited Medications  
While partic ipating in this study, a patient may not receive any standard or investigational agent 
for treatment of a tumor other than cemiplimab as monotherapy or in combination with ISA101b, 
per the study’s specified dosing regimens.  
• After communication with the spo nsor, focal palliative treatment (eg, radiation) is 
allowed under the following circumstances:  
− For local control of a tumor once a patient has completed 24 weeks of study 
treatment.  
− For pain management at sites of bone disease or lesions in the brain (as long as the 
lesions are not followed for treatment response evaluation).  
• Patients using immunosuppressive doses (>10 mg per day of prednisone or equivalent) 
of systemic corticosteroids other than for corticosteroid replacement will not be eligible 
for the  study. It is recommended that patients do not receive systemic corticosteroids 
such as hydrocortisone, prednisone, prednisolone (Solu -Medrol®), or dexamethasone 
(Decadron ®) at any time throughout the study except in the case of a life -threatening 
illness and/or to treat an imAE.  
• It is recommended that patients do not receive other immunosuppressive medications 
at any time throughout the study except in the case of a life -threatening emergency 
and/or to treat and imAE or IRR. Examples of immunosuppressives that may be used 
for treatment of imAEs are mentioned in Appendix  2. Investigators are allowed to treat 
adverse events requiring immunosuppressive med ication using their institutional 
standard, which may involve medications not specifically mentioned in the protocol.  
• Prophylactic or therapeutic anticoagulation therapy is allowed after discussion with 
study sponsor as gastrointestinal adverse events are common with immune checkpoint 
inhibitors. Patients on anticoagulants have to be monitored closely.  
• Patients are not allowed to undergo surgical resection of the primary tumor site.  
8.7.2.  Permitted Medications  
While participating in this study, a patient may re ceive medications or therapies other than study 
drug under the following conditions:  
• Physiologic replacement doses of systemic corticosteroids are permitted, even if 
>10 mg/day prednisone equivalents.  
                                        VV-RIM-00164906-1.0 Approved - 31 Aug 2021 GMT-5:00

Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.   Page 56 
 CONFIDENTIAL  • A brief course of corticosteroids for prophylaxis (eg,  contrast dye allergy) or for 
treatment of non -autoimmune conditions (eg, delayed -type hypersensitivity reaction 
caused by contact allergen) is permitted.  
• Gonadotropin -releasing hormone agonist therapy (eg, for prostate cancer) may be 
continued and is not prohibited.  
• Hormone -replacement therapy is allowed.  
• Inhaled, topical, ophthalmologic, or intranasal steroids are allowed.  
• Treatments for bone metastases (bisphosphonates, denosumab) are allowed.  
• Any other medication which is considered necessary for the pa tient’s welfare, and 
which is not expected to interfere with the evaluation of the study drug, may be given 
at the discretion of the investigator.  
COVID -19 Vaccination During the Study  
COVID -19 vaccination may be administered to patients enrolled in R2810 -ONC -ISA-1981 in 
accordance with local regulatory guidance.  Currently, there is limited data on safety and efficacy 
interactions between approved COVID -19 vaccines and cemiplimab and/or ISA101b.  
It is recommended for patients to complete COVID -19 vaccinat ion at least 14 days prior to 
receiving the first dose of ISA101b or to delay COVID -19 vaccination until at least 14 days after 
the final dose of ISA101b.  
It is recommended to use different limbs for the administration of a COVID -19 vaccine and 
contiguous ISA101b vaccine. It is recommended not to receive a COVID -19 vaccine if the patient 
has a known allergy to the COVID -19 vaccine or one of its components.  
There should be an individual risk/benefit analysis for each patient when receiving COVID -19 
vaccination while enrolled in R2810 -ONC -ISA-1981.  
8.8. Treatment with Cemiplimab Beyond Disease Progression  
It is recognized that a minority of patients treated with immunotherapy may derive clinical benefit 
despite initial evidence of progressive disease.  
Patients who experience RECIST 1.1 -defined progressive disease will be permitted to continue 
treatment until further progression is observed, provided the following criteria are met:  
• Investigator assesses continued use of a PD -1 therapy is appropriate  
• Patient continues to meet all other study eligibility criteria, as defined in the 
inclusion/exclusion criteria (Section  7.2) 
• Patient is tolerant of cemipl imab and has a stable performance status.  
• Patient provides written informed consent prior to resuming treatment by signing the 
current version of the ICF (eg, the patient repeats the written informed consent that was 
done prior to initial study enrollment ). 
• Patients do not have evidence of rapidly progressing disease

 CONFIDENTIAL  It is understood that, if there is further progression after resumption of treatment (≥30% increase 
in tumor burden from the time of initial progressive disease by RECIST criteria; this includ es an 
increase in the sum of all target lesions and/or the development of new lesions), that cemiplimab 
will be discontinued.  
Patients should continue with assessments according to Table  2.

 CONFIDENTIAL  9. STUDY SCHEDULE OF EV ENTS AND PROCEDURES  
9.1. Schedule of Events  
Study assessments and procedures are presented by study period and visit in Table  2. 
The allowable window for all visit days and assessments is ±3 business days (excluding weekends 
and holidays), unless otherwise stated. All other "days" in the protocol refer to calendar days. For 
tumor assessments (CT or MRI), t he window is ±7 days from planned scan dates , unless otherwise 
stated .  
Missed doses of cemiplimab or visits will not be made up. In the case of missed doses of 
cemiplimab, tumor assessments should still follow original schedule. If a patient is unable to 
undergo scans within the window due to logistical or medical reasons, tumor assessment will be 
obtained at the next available date.  
Missed doses of ISA101b are detailed in Section  8.3.1.3.1 . 
In light of the public health emergency related to COVID -19, the continuity of clinical study 
conduct and oversight may require implementat ion of temporary or alternative mechanisms. 
Examples of such mechanisms may include, but are not limited to, any of the following: phone 
contact, virtual visits, telemedicine visits, online meetings, non -invasive remote monitoring 
devices, use of local cli nic or laboratory locations, and home visits by skilled staff. Additionally, 
no waivers to deviate from protocol enrollment criteria due to COVID -19 will be granted. All 
temporary mechanisms utilized, and deviations from planned study procedures are to be 
documented as being related to COVID -19 and will remain in effect only for the duration of the 
public health emergency.

 CONFIDENTIAL  9.1.1.  Footnotes for the Schedule of Events Table  
1. Patients who fail screening may be screened 1 additional time and an ICF will need to be 
signed at the re -screen. Some procedures may not need to be repeated if they were 
previously completed within 28 days prior to cycle 1 day 1.  
2. Cycle 1 is 7 weeks long, cycles 2 through 4 are 6 weeks long, and all subsequent cycles 
are 9 weeks long.  
3. Due to ±3 -day windows of visits, the last day of a cycle may coincide with the first day 
of the next cycle (eg, C1D50 may be the same visit as C2D1, etc).  
4. Patients who discontinue stud y drug due to progression of disease should proceed to the 
EOT visit, safety follow -up, and survival follow -up. 
5. Patients who discontinue study drug for reasons other than progression of disease (as 
detailed in Section  7.3 and Section  8.2.2 ) should proceed to the EOT visit, safety follow -
up, and tumor assessments . If these patients experience progression during tumor 
assessments, they should proceed to survival follow -up. 
6. Informed consent must be provided before the initiation of screening procedures and must 
be obtained within 45  days prior to cycle 1 day 1. All screening assessments must be 
performed within 28 days prior to cycle 1 day 1 (for tumor tissue sample, see 
Section  9.2.1.1 ). Assessments performed as part of standard of care that fall within the 
screening window, but before informed consent is obtained, may be used for screening and 
need not be repeated for enrollment eligibility.  
7. Local electrocardiograms (ECG) should be performed before blood is drawn during visits 
requiring blood draws.  
8. On days when cemiplimab and ISA101b are administered together, cemiplimab will be 
administered first, and ISA101b will be administered approximately 1 hour after the end 
of the cemiplimab infusion.  
9. Patien ts must be observed for 4 hours after each ISA101b administration.  
10. During the treatment period, imaging should be acquired in the window of the scheduled 
imaging day (scheduled imaging day  ±7 days). Brain imaging is optional as clinically 
indicated.  
11. If the EOT visit falls within 30 days of the last cycle tumor assessment, the CT scan and/or 
MRI does not need to be repeated.  
12. If cycle 1 day 1 is within 72 hours of screening, this assessment does not need to be repeated 
at cycle 1 day 1.  
13. Complete physical exa mination includes head and neck, lungs, heart, abdomen, lymph 
nodes, extremities, and skin. A brief neurologic examination should also be performed.   
14. Limited physical exam includes lungs, heart, abdomen, and skin.  
15. Vital signs are collected within 10  minu tes prior to infusion, and approximately 15  minutes 
(±10 minutes) after the completion of the infusion. Vital signs will also be taken every hour 
                                        VV-RIM-00164906-1.0 Approved - 31 Aug 2021 GMT-5:00

 CONFIDENTIAL  during the 4 -hour observation after administration of ISA101b. Note: Blood pressure 
should be measured after t he patient has been resting quietly for at least 5  minutes. Blood 
pressure may be obtained from a seated or recumbent position and should be done 
consistently throughout the study. When scheduled at the same time as other procedures, 
vital signs should be measured prior to clinical laboratory assessments, PK, or exploratory 
sample collection.  
16. Hematology and chemistry samples may be obtained ≤72 hours prior to cemiplimab 
treatment.  
17. Pre-dose serum or urine β -human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) up to 72 hours p rior to 
study drug administration. Serum/urine pregnancy tests are requirements for women of 
child bearing potential only.  
18. Serum samples for cemiplimab concentration will be collected from all patients pre -dose 
(Ctrough) on cycle 1 day 1 and every other c ycle for the first 2 years of treatment. After 
2 years, samples for cemiplimab concentration will be collected pre -dose every 6  months 
(24 weeks) during therapy and at EOT.  
19. ADA serum samples for cemiplimab will be collected pre -dose of cemiplimab 
administr ation on day 1 of cycle 1, and pre -dose of cemiplimab on day 1 of cycles 3 and 
5 for the first year of treatment, then pre -dose every 4 cycles for the subsequent years of 
treatment (eg, C9, C13 and so on) and at EOT. In the event of AESI, additional sample s 
may be collected for ADA analysis at or near the event when possible.  
20. Peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) collection is optional. PBMC samples will be 
collected pre -dose on day 1, 8, and 29 of cycle 1, pre -dose on day 1 of cycles 2 through 4, 
day 1 of cycles 5+, and at end of treatment.  
21. Pharmacogenomics (optional sub -study): See Section  9.2.10 . 
9.1.2.  End of Treatment Visit  
All patients will attend an en d of treatment visit 30 days after their last dose of study drug.  
Patients who are withdrawn from the study before the primary endpoint visit (cycle 4 day 43) will 
be asked to return to the clinic once for an end of treatment visit consisting of the assess ments 
described in Table  2. 
9.1.3.  Unscheduled Visits  
All attempts should be made to keep patients on the study schedule. Unscheduled visits may be 
necessary to  repeat testing following abnormal laboratory results, for follow -up of AEs, or for any 
other reason, as warranted.  
9.1.4.  Follow -Up  
After progression, patients will complete end of treatment visit, safety follow -up visit, and have 
survival follow -up approximate ly every 4 months ( Table  2). 
                                        VV-RIM-00164906-1.0 Approved - 31 Aug 2021 GMT-5:00

 CONFIDENTIAL  Patients who discontinue study drug for reasons other than progression will be followed 
approximately every 4 months by scans until disease progression or until patient commences 
another anticancer systemic therapy, whichever comes first.  
After progression, survival follow -up should occur approximately every 4 months. This may be 
done by phone contact.  
9.2. Study Procedures  
9.2.1.  Proc edures Performed Only at the Screening Visit  
The following procedures will be performed for the sole purpose of determining study eligibility 
or characterizing the baseline population:  
• Inclusion/exclusion criteria  
• Informed consent  
• Medical history and demog raphics  
• Tumor tissue sample for documentation of pathologic confirmation of cervical cancer 
and HPV16 diagnostic testing  
• HBV, HCV, and HIV testing  
Patients who fail screening may be screened 1 additional time. Some procedures may not need to 
be repeated if  they were previously completed within 28 days prior to cycle 1 day 1, and an ICF 
will need to be re -signed if prior ICF signing is beyond 45 days of cycle 1 day 1.  
9.2.1.1.  HPV16 Diagnostic Test  
For HPV16 determination, a formalin -fixed, paraffin -embedded tissue b lock or unstained slides of 
tumor samples must be provided after the ICF is signed. Tumor biopsies should be of sufficient 
size or quantity to ensure an adequate amount of tissue for analysis. Complete instructions on the 
collection, processing, handling a nd shipment of all samples will be provided in the laboratory 
manual. A validated assay at a central laboratory will be used for determination of HPV16 
genotyping in patient samples and to determine eligibility based on HPV16 positivity. Samples 
should be sent to the central laboratory at any point during the period between ICF signing and 
cycle 1 day 1 (including prior to the screening period; effort should be made to ship the sample 
just after the ICF is signed to ensure the result is received on time to confirm eligibility). The use 
of HPV16 for decisions regarding treatment with ISA101/ISA101b is considered investigational.  
9.2.2.  Efficacy Procedures  
9.2.2.1.  Computed Tomography and/or Magnetic Resonance Imaging  
Diagnostic quality contrast -enhanced CT and contrast -enhan ced MRI are the preferred imaging 
modalities for assessing radiographic tumor response. In patients whom contrast is strictly 
contraindicated, non -contrast MRI scans and CT chest scans are acceptable. The chest, abdomen, 
and pelvis must be imaged along wit h any other known or suspected sites of disease. If more than 
one imaging modality is used at screening for the same anatomies, the most accurate imaging 
                                        VV-RIM-00164906-1.0 Approved - 31 Aug 2021 GMT-5:00
Clinical Study Protocol   R2810 -ONC -ISA-1981 Amendment 2  
 
 
Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.   Page 65 
 CONFIDENTIAL  modality according to RECIST 1.1 should be used when recording data. The same imaging 
modality and tec hniques used at screening should be used for all subsequent assessments. At 
screening, MRI of the brain with contrast or without contrast if contrast is contraindicated, or CT 
with contrast when MRI is contraindicated, should be performed in patients with a known history 
of treated brain metastasis. Additional sites of known disease (including CNS) should be imaged 
at screening. Refer to the Site Imaging Manual for details of imaging requirements.  
After the baseline tumor assessment, radiographic tumor asse ssments will be obtained in all 
patients at the time points indicated in Table  2 (with a window of ±7 days) . During safety follow -
up, radiographic evalua tion will be performed every 4 months until RECIST 1.1 -defined 
progressive disease, withdrawal of consent, death, or initiation of another anticancer treatment.  
Tumor assessments should be performed even if dosing is interrupted. Weeks and months are in 
reference to the calendar week and month and should not be adjusted due to dosing 
delays/interruptions. Cycle 1 day 1 date is the reference for all visits including tumor assessments 
visits.  
De-identified scans will be collected and, at the Sponsor’s discre tion, reviewed by independent 
radiologists using RECIST criteria at a later date, or at any time during the study.  
9.2.2.1.1.  Tumor Burden Assessments  
Tumor measurements will be performed in accordance with RECIST 1.1. Criteria 
(Eisenhauer,  2009 ) (Appendix  3) and should be done by the same investigator or radiologist for 
each assessment  of a patient, to the extent feasible.   
Investigators will assess response to therapy using RECIST 1.1 criteria. RECIST 1.1 -defined 
progressive disease determined by the investigator will be used for clinical  management of the 
patient. RECIST 1.1 -based tumor burden assessments will be used for evaluation of efficacy 
endpoints.  
9.2.3.  Safety Procedures  
9.2.3.1.  Electrocardiogram  
Local ECGs should be performed before blood is drawn during visits requiring blood draws. A 
standar d 12-lead ECG will be performed at time points according to Table  2. Heart rate will be 
recorded from the ventricular rate, and the PR, QRS, RR and QT (identify QTcB or QTcF) 
intervals will be recorded. The ECG strips or reports will be retained with the source.  
9.2.3.2.  Performance Status  
Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group  performance status will be performed at the time points 
according to Table  2. Performance status will be assessed according to ECOG criteria in 
Appendix  1. 
9.2.3.3.  Body Weight and Height  
Body weight will be assessed using calibrated scales. Patients should void (empty bladder) prior

Other Laboratory Tests  
Thyroid Function Tests:  Thyroid -stimulating hormone (with reflex T3, free T4) will be tested at 
visits specified in Table  2 while the patient is on treatment. If TSH is abnormal, T3 and free T4 
should be measured at the investigative site’s local laboratory. If an investigative site routinely 
performs total T3 and/or total T4 tests, these measurements will be acceptable in lieu of free T3 or 
free T4.  
Coagulation Tests:  Prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time testing will be 
performed at visits specified in Table  2 while the patient is on treatment. Sites may report INR and 
activated PTT if it is the standard of care at that site.  
Viral Serology Tests:  HBV, HCV, and HIV serum antibodies will be tested at visits specified in 
Table  2. 
Pregnancy Tests:  Serum β -HCG or urine β -HCG will be measured ≤72 hours prior to study drug 
administration) and serum/urine β -HCG will be measure at all other time points as specified in 
Table  2. 
Abnormal Laboratory Values and Laboratory Adverse Events  
All laboratory values must be reviewed by the investigator or authorized designee.  
Significa ntly abnormal test results that occur after start of treatment must be repeated to confirm 
the nature and degree of the abnormality. When necessary, appropriate ancillary investigations 
should be initiated. If the abnormality fails to resolve or cannot be explained by events or 
conditions unrelated to the study medication or its administration, the Medical/Study Director must 
be consulted.  
The clinical significance of an abnormal test value, within the context of the disease under study, 
must be determined by the investigator.  
Criteria for reporting laboratory values as an AE are provided in Section  10.1.1 . 
9.2.3.7.  Additional Samples  
Any additional samples (eg, pulmonary effusion fluid, ascites fluid, etc) collected as a part of 
standard -of-care or symptomatic management while on study may be sent for analysis.  These 
collections are optional but encouraged for further understanding of interactions between patien ts, 
disease, and study drugs.  
9.2.4.  Drug Concentration and Pharmacokinetic Measurements  
Samples for cemiplimab concentration will be collected at visits listed in Table  2.  
Any unused samples may be used for exploratory biomarker research or to investigate AEs as 
appropriate.

 CONFIDENTIAL  9.2.5.  Immunogenicity Measurements and Samples  
Samples for ADA assessment of cemiplimab will be collected at time points listed in Table  2. In 
response to AESI like anaphylaxis or hypersensitivity, additional ADA samples closer to the event 
may be collected and analyzed when possible,  based on the judgement of the medical investigator 
and/or medical monitor (in treatment, follow -up, or resumption of treatment). The exact date and 
time of sample collection must be recorded and entered into the electronic data capture (EDC).  
Any unused s amples may be used for exploratory biomarker research or to investigate AEs as 
appropriate.  
9.2.6.  Pharmacodynamic and Exploratory Biomarker Procedures  
In this study, research assessments will be performed to better understand the baseline predictive 
biomarkers o f cemiplimab + ISA101b response that may include but are not limited to tumor tissue 
analysis of PD -L1 expression and immune cell subsets by IHC or RNAScope, tumor DNA and 
RNA sequencing. Pharmacodynamic and tumor biomarker samples will be collected at tim e points 
according to Table  2, and measurements will be performed to determine treatment effect on the 
disease and relevant physiological processes. The b iomarkers studied are believed to be relevant 
to the pathophysiology of indication target engagement, mechanism of action of cemiplimab and 
possible toxicities.  
Biomarker assays may include, but will not be limited to, the following:  
• Tumor specific and HP V gene panel (circulating tumor DNA sequence profile)  
• T cell effector and innate immune cytokine panel (serum cytokines)  
• T cell, myeloid cell subset analysis, functional HPV E6/E7 specific T cell assays  
9.2.7.  Peripheral Blood Biomarkers  
Samples for peripheral bl ood (plasma, serum, and PBMC samples) biomarker assessments will be 
collected at time points listed in Table  2. 
PBMC collection is optional. PBMCs from p atients receiving cemiplimab may be used for 
characterization of immune cell subsets including T cells, B cells, natural killer cells, monocytes, 
dendritic cells, and subsets of these cell types.  Peripheral blood mononuclear cell samples may 
also be used to assess immune cell function, including T cell activation and proliferation.  
9.2.8.  Survival Data Collection  
Every effort will be made to collect survival data on all patients, including patients who 
discontinued the study for any reason but have not withdrawn consent to collect survival 
information.  If the death of a patient is not reported, the date of the last patient contact in this 
study will be used in the determination of the patient’s last known date of alive. Use of publicly 
available information shoul d only be in accordance with local law.  
9.2.9.  Future Biomedical Research (Optional)  
Patients who agree to participate in the future biomedical research sub -study will be required to 
consent to this optional sub -study before samples are banked in long -term storag e.  The unused

 CONFIDENTIAL  biomarker samples for study -related research, as well as unused PK and ADA samples, will be 
stored for up to 15 years after the final date of the database lock. The unused samples may be 
utilized for future biomedical research. Future biomed ical research may include assay 
development and/or validation, and the samples may be used as references or controls in unrelated 
experiments After 15 years, any residual samples will be destroyed. The results of these future 
biomedical research analyses w ill not be presented in the CSR.  
9.2.10.  Pharmacogenomic Analysis (Optional)  
Patients who agree to participate in the genomics sub -study will be required to consent to this 
optional sub -study before collection of a pharmacogenomics -specific whole blood sample. Thi s 
sample may be collected during screening or any other time point for study -related research 
(Table  2), and genomic DNA will be extracted for analysis a s described below.  
The DNA samples for pharmacogenomics analyses will be single -coded as defined by the 
International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) guideline E15 samples. Samples will be stored for 
up to 15 years after the final date of the database lock . If there are specific site or country 
requirements involving the pharmacogenomic analyses with which the sponsor is unable to 
comply, samples will not be collected at those sites.  
The purpose of the pharmacogenomic analyses is to identify genomic associ ations with clinical 
(safety or efficacy) or biomarker response to cemiplimab, clinical outcome measures, and possible 
AEs. In addition, associations between genomic variants and prognosis or progression of cervical 
cancer or related diseases may also be s tudied. These data may be used or combined with data 
collected from other studies to identify and validate genomic markers related to the study drug, 
target pathway, or cervical cancer and related diseases.  
Analyses may include sequence determination or single nucleotide polymorphism studies of 
candidate genes and surrounding genomic regions. Other methods, including whole -exome 
sequencing, whole -genome sequencing, DNA copy number variation, methods for quantifying 
epigenetic modifications, and sequencing  of the somatically recombined adaptive immune receptor 
loci may also be performed, including comparison to DNA extracted from tumor tissue biopsies. 
The list of methods may be expanded to include novel methodology that may be developed during 
the course o f this study or sample storage period.

 CONFIDENTIAL  10. SAFETY EVALUATION AN D REPORTING  
10.1. Recording and Reporting Adverse Events  
10.1.1.  Adverse Events  
The investigator (or designee) will seek information on AEs at each patient contact, and record all 
AEs that occur from the time th e informed consent is signed until 90 days after the last study 
treatment, or until the patient commences another anticancer systemic therapy, whichever comes 
first.  After informed consent has been obtained but prior to initiation of study drug, only the 
following AEs should be reported:  
• SAEs  
• Non-SAEs caused by a protocol -mandated intervention (eg, non -SAEs related to 
invasive procedures such as biopsies)  
Other AEs that occur prior to the first treatment should be reported on the medical history CRF.  
All AEs after initiation of study treatment and until 90 days after the last study treatment, 
regardless of relationship to study treatment, will be reported on the AE CRF.  Additionally, any 
SAE or other AE of concern that the investigator believes may be rel ated to study treatment and 
that occurs later than 90 days after last study treatment, or after the patient has commenced another 
anticancer systemic therapy (whichever comes first) should be reported.  
Study treatment includes cemiplimab and ISA101b.  
Infor mation on follow -up for AEs is provided in Section  10.1.2 .  Laboratory, vital signs, or ECG 
abnormalities are to be recorded as AEs as outlined in Se ction 10.1.5 . 
10.1.2.  Serious Adverse Events  
All SAEs, regardless of assessment of causal relationship to study treatment must be reported to 
the sponsor (o r designee) within 24 hours.  Refer to the study reference manuals for the procedure 
to be followed.  
Information not available at the time of the initial report must be documented in a follow -up report.  
Substantiating data such as relevant hospital or med ical records and diagnostic test reports may 
also be requested.  
In the event the investigator is informed of an SAE that occurs after 90 days after the last dose of 
study treatment, or after the patient commences another anticancer systemic therapy (whiche ver 
comes first), only those SAEs or other AEs of concern deemed by the investigator to be related to 
study treatment will be reported to the sponsor.  The investigator should make every effort to 
obtain follow -up information on the outcome of a treatment -related SAE until the event is 
considered chronic and/or stable.  
10.1.3.  Other Events that Require Accelerated Reporting to Sponsor  
The following events also require reporting to the sponsor (or designee) within 24  hours of learning 
of the event:

Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.   Page 71 
 CONFIDENTIAL  Symptomatic Overd ose of Study Drug:  Accidental or intentional overdose of at least 2  times 
the intended dose of study drug within the intended therapeutic window, if 
associated with an AE.  
Pregnancy:  Although pregnancy is not considered an AE, it is the responsibility of t he 
investigator to report to the sponsor (or designee), within 24  hours of identification, 
any pregnancy occurring in a female during the study or within 6  months of the last 
dose of study drug.  Any complication of pregnancy affecting a female study patient 
and/or fetus and/or newborn that meets the SAE criteria must be reported as an 
SAE.  Outcome for all pregnancies should be reported to the sponsor.  
Adverse Events of Special Interest (applicable to cemiplimab only):  All AESI, serious and 
nonserious , must be reported within 24  hours of identification using the same 
reporting process as for SAE reporting, per Section  10.1.2 .  Adverse events of 
special interest for this study include the following:   
The following will be considered AESI for this study:  
• Grade ≥2 infusion related reactions  
• Grade ≥2 allergic/hypersensitivity reaction s 
• Grade ≥3 imAEs (see Section  10.1.3.1 ) 
• An imAE of any grade in a patient previously treated with a PI 3 -K inhibitor  
NOTE  (Applicable to cemiplimab only):  An imAE can occur shortly after the 
first dose or several mon ths after the last dose of treatment.  All AEs of unknown 
etiology associated with drug exposure should be evaluated to determine possible 
immune etiology.  If an imAE is suspected, efforts should be made to rule out 
neoplastic, infectious, metabolic, toxi n or other etiologic causes prior to labeling 
an AE as an imAE.  
10.1.3.1.  Immune -Mediated Adverse Events  
Detailed guidance of management of imAEs is provided in Section  8.2.3  and Appendix  2. 
NOTE : Regarding imAEs, for any AE that is of a type known to be potentially immune -related 
(eg rash, colitis, elevated transaminases, or endocrine) but is deemed not to be an imAE by the 
investigator, the sponsor may request additional information.  
10.1.4.  Reporting Adverse Events Leading to Withdrawal from the Study  
All AEs that lead to a patient’s withdrawal from the study must be reported to the sponsor’s 
medical monitor within 30 days.  
10.1.5.  Abnorma l Laboratory, Vital Signs, or Electrocardiogram Results  
The criteria for determining whether an abnormal objective test finding should be reported as an 
AE include:  
• The test result is associated with accompanying symptoms, and/or  
                                        VV-RIM-00164906-1.0 Approved - 31 Aug 2021 GMT-5:00
Clinical Study Protocol   R2810 -ONC -ISA-1981 Amendment 2  
 
 
Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.   Page 72 
 CONFIDENTIAL  • The test result requires a dditional diagnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention, 
and/or  
• The test result leads to a change in dosing (outside of protocol -stipulated dose 
adjustments), discontinuation from the study, significant additional concomitant drug 
treatment, or other  therapy  
Contact the medical monitor in the event the investigator feels that an abnormal test finding should 
be reported as an AE, although it does not meet any of the above criteria.  
Repeating an abnormal test, in the absence of any of the above conditio ns, does not constitute an 
AE.  Any abnormal test result that is determined to be an error does not require reporting as an 
AE. 
Evaluation of severity of laboratory abnormalities will be assessed according to the scale outlined 
in Section  10.2.5 . 
10.2. Definitions  
10.2.1.  Adverse Event  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient administered a study drug which may or 
may not have a causal relationship with  the study drug. Therefore, an AE is any unfavorable and 
unintended sign (including abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease which is temporally 
associated with the use of a study drug, whether or not considered related to the study drug 
(ICH,  Oct 1994 ). 
10.2.2.  Serious Adverse Event  
An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
• Results in death  – includes all deaths, even those that appear to be completely 
unrelated to study drug (eg, a car accident in which a patient is a passenger).  
• Is life-threatening  – in the view of the investigator, the patient is at immediate risk of  
death at the time of the event.  This does not include an AE that had it occurred in a 
more severe form, might have caused death.  
• Requires in -patient hospitalization  or prolongation of existing hospitalization .  
In-patient hospitalization is defined as a hospital admission (any duration) or an 
emergency room visit for longer than 24 hours.  Prolongation of existing hospitalization 
is defined as a hospital stay that is longer than was originally anticipated for the event 
or is prolonged due to the developme nt of a new AE as determined by the investigator 
or treating physician.  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  (substantial disruption of 
one’s ability to conduct normal life functions).   
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• Is an impo rtant medical event - Important medical events may not be immediately 
life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the patient or 
                                        VV-RIM-00164906-1.0 Approved - 31 Aug 2021 GMT-5:00

Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.   Page 73 
 CONFIDENTIAL  may require intervention to prevent one of the other serious outcomes listed above (eg, 
intensive  treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood 
dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization; or development of drug 
dependency or drug abuse).  
Hospitalization or death due solely to manifestations consistent with typical progression of 
underlying malignancy will not be considered an SAE.  
Criteria for reporting SAEs must be followed for these events.  
10.2.3.  Adverse Events of Special Interest  
An AESI (serious or non -serious) is one of scientific and medical interest specific to the sponsor’s 
product or program, for which ongoing monitoring and rapid communication by the investigator 
to the sponsor can be appropriate.  Such an event might warrant further investigation in order to 
characterize and understand it.   
10.2.4.  Infus ion Reactions  
Infusion reactions are defined as any relevant AE that occurs during the infusion or within 24  hours 
after the infusion is completed.  
All infusion reactions must be reported as AEs (defined in Section  10.2.1 ) and graded using the 
grading scales as instructed in Section  10.2. 5. 
10.2.5.  Severity  
The severity of AEs, infusion reactions, and injection site reactions will be graded using the NCI -
CTCAE v5.0 grading system. Adverse events not listed in the NCI -CTCAE v5.0, will b e graded 
according to the following scale:  
• 1 (Mild): Mild AE (minor; no specific medical intervention; asymptomatic laboratory 
findings only, radiographic findings only; marginal clinical relevance)  
• 2 (Moderate): Moderate AE (minimal intervention; local in tervention; noninvasive 
intervention [packing, cautery])  
• 3 (Severe): Severe and undesirable AE (significant symptoms requiring hospitalization 
or invasive intervention; transfusion; elective interventional radiological procedure; 
therapeutic endoscopy or o peration)  
• 4 (Life –threatening): Life -threatening or disabling AE (complicated by acute, life 
threatening metabolic or cardiovascular complications such as circulatory failure, 
hemorrhage, sepsis. Life -threatening physiologic consequences; need for intensiv e care 
or emergent invasive procedure; emergent interventional radiological procedure, 
therapeutic endoscopy or operation)  
• 5 (Death): Death associated with an AE.  
10.2.6.  Causality  
The investigator must provide causality assessment as whether or not there is a rea sonable 
possibility that the drug caused the adverse event, based on evidence or facts, his/her clinical 
                                        VV-RIM-00164906-1.0 Approved - 31 Aug 2021 GMT-5:00

 CONFIDENTIAL  judgment, and the following definitions. The causality assessment must be made based on the 
available information and can be updated as new information  becomes available.  
The following factors should be considered when assessing causality:  
• Temporal relationship: time to onset vs time drug was administered  
• Nature of the reactions: immediate vs. long term  
• Clinical and pathological features of the events  
• Existing information about the drug & same class of drugs  
• Concomitant medications  
• Underlying and concurrent illnesses  
• Response to dechallenge (drug discontinuation) or dose reduction  
• Response to rechallenge (re -introduction of the drug) or dose increase , when 
applicable  
• Patient’s medical and social history  
Causality to the study drug (including study drug administration):  
• Related:  
− The AE follows a reasonable temporal sequence from study drug administration, 
and cannot be reasonably explained by the nat ure of the reaction, patient’s clinical 
(eg, disease under study, concurrent diseases, concomitant medications), or other 
external factors.  
or 
− The AE follows a reasonable temporal sequence from study drug administration, 
and is a known reaction to the drug  under study or its class of drugs, or is predicted 
by known pharmacology.  
• Not Related:  
− The AE does not follow a reasonable sequence from study drug administration, or 
can be reasonably explained by the nature of the reaction, patient’s clinical state 
(eg, disease under study, concurrent diseases, and concomitant medications) or 
other external factors.  
Causality to the study conduct (protocol specified procedure):  
• Related:  
− The AE follows a reasonable temporal sequence from a protocol specified 
procedure, an d cannot be reasonably explained by the nature of the reaction, 
patient’s clinical (eg, disease under study, concurrent diseases, concomitant 
medications), or other external factors.

(eg, disease under study, concurrent diseases, and concomitant medications) or 
other external factors.  
10.3. Safety Monitoring  
The investigator will moni tor the safety of study patient at his/her site(s) as per the requirements 
of this protocol and consistent with current Good Clinical Practice (GCP). Any questions or 
concerns should be discussed with the sponsor in a timely fashion. The sponsor will monit or the 
safety data from across all study sites. The Medical/Study Director will have primary responsibility 
for the emerging safety profile of the compound, but will be supported by other departments 
(eg, Pharmacovigilance; Risk Management; Biostatistics a nd Data Management). Safety 
monitoring will be performed on an ongoing basis (eg, individual review of SAEs) and on a 
periodic cumulative aggregate basis.  
10.4. Notifying Health Authorities, Institutional Review Board/Ethics 
Committee, and Investigators  
During t he study, the sponsor and/or the CRO will inform health authorities, IECs/IRBs, and the 
participating investigators of any SUSARs (Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions) 
occurring in other study centers or other studies of the active study drug (c emiplimab), as 
appropriate per local reporting requirements. In addition, the sponsor and/or CRO will comply 
with any additional local safety reporting requirements. All notifications to investigators will 
contain only masked information.  
Upon receipt of the sponsor’s notification of a SUSAR that occurred with the study drug, the 
investigator will inform the Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Ethics Committee (EC) unless 
delegated to the sponsor.  
Event expectedness for study drug (cemiplimab) is assessed aga inst the Reference Safety 
Information section of the most recently approved version of the Investigator’s Brochure that is 
effective for expedited safety reporting.  
At the completion of the study, the sponsor will report all safety observations made durin g the 
conduct of the trial in the Clinical Study Report to health authorities and IECs/IRB as appropriate.

 CONFIDENTIAL  11. STATISTICAL PLAN  
This section provides the basis for the statistical analysis plan (SAP) for the study. The SAP will 
be revised prior to the database  lock to accommodate amendments to the clinical study protocol 
and to make changes to adapt to unexpected issues in study execution and data that may affect the 
planned analyses.  
Endpoints are listed in Section  4. Analysis variables are listed in Section  5.  
Data collected regarding the impact o f the COVID -19 pandemic on the patients will be 
summarized (eg, discontinuation due to COVID -19). Any additional analyses and methods 
required to investigate the impact of COVID -19 on the efficacy (eg, missing data due to COVID -
19) and safety evaluation wi ll be specified in the SAP.  
11.1. Statistical Hypothesis  
This is a single arm, open label study and t here is no formal statistical hypothesis in this study . 
11.2. Justification of Sample Size  
The planned total sample size for this study is 10 5 patients.  
The primary ob jective of the study is to estimate the clinical benefit of cemiplimab + ISA101b 
after progression on first line chemotherapy, as assessed by objective response rate (ORR).  With 
105 patients, Table  3 below present s various response rate s and associated 2 -sided 95% CI s using 
a normal approximation of the binomial distribution , and precision of estimation defined as 
distance from the boundary to the center. If observed ORR ranges from 20 .0% to 3 4.3%, the 
precision estimation using 10 5 patients ranges from 7. 7% to 9. 1%.

 CONFIDENTIAL  APPENDIX  2. GUIDELINES FOR MANAG EMENT OF IMMUNE -MEDI ATED ADVERSE EVENTS  
Select immune -mediated adverse events (imAEs) and their management are described in this appendix. Additionally, the following 
general principles apply to management of i mAEs, if not described in detail in this appendix:  
Grade 1 : Continue study treatment with close monitoring and provide symptomatic management.   
Grade 2 : Consider withholding study treatment  
Grade 3 : Withhold study treatment  
Grade 4 : Discontinue study treatment.  
Temporary hold and resumption.  Except as described for select imAEs, if cemiplimab is withheld for grade ≤3 imAE, consider 
resuming when the imAE improves to grade 0 or 1 after corticosteroid taper to ≤ prednisone 10 mg/day or equivalent.  
Perma nent discontinuation.  Except as described for select imAEs, give an initial dose of 1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent 
followed by a taper and  permanently discontinue study treatment for:  
• Grade 4 adverse reactions (excluding endocrinopathies)  
• Recurr ent Grade 3 imAEs  
• Grade 2 or 3 imAEs persistent for ≥12 weeks after the last study treatment  
• Requirement for ≥10 mg per day prednisone or equivalent lasting ≥12 weeks after the last study treatment.  
For guidance in addition to that provided here, please r efer to regional imAE management guidelines, such as those provided by NCCN 
or ESMO. In countries where cemiplimab has a marketing authori zation the local product information may be consulted. Note that local 
and regional treatment guidelines and cemiplima b product information may be updated periodically and the latest version should always 
be reviewed.

 CONFIDENTIAL  APPENDIX  3. RESPONSE EVALUATION CRITERIA IN SOLID 
TUMORS: RECIST GUIDE LINE (VERSION 1.1)  
This appendix has been excerpted from the revised Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 
(RECIST) guideline (version  1.1); ( Eisenhauer, 2009 ). For full details pertaining to the RECIST 
1.1 criteria, please refer to the publicati on. 
1. Assessment of Tumor Burden Measurable Disease at Baseline  
Overall tumor burden must be assessed at baseline and will be used as comparator for subsequent 
measurements. Tumor lesions will be characterized as measurable or non -measurable as follows:  
Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the international criteria proposed 
by the revised Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) guideline (version 1.1); 
(Eisenhauer, 2009 ). Changes in the largest diameter (unidimensional measurement) of the tumor 
lesions and the shortest diam eter in the case of malignant lymph nodes are used in the RECIST 
criteria.  
1.1. Measurable disease  
• Tumor lesions must be accurately measured i n at least one dimension (longest diameter 
in the plane of measurement is to be recorded) with a minimum size of  
− 10 mm by computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan 
(slice thickness recommended to be no greater than 5  mm)  
− 10 mm cal iper measurement by clinical exam (lesions which cannot be accurately 
measured with calipers should be recorded as non -measurable)  
• Malignant lymph nodes:  To be considered pathologically enlarged and measurable, a 
lymph node must be ≥15 mm in short axis wh en assessed by CT or MRI scan (slice 
thickness recommended to be no greater than 5 mm).  At baseline and in follow -up, 
only the short axis will be measured and followed.  
1.2. Nonmeasurable Disease   
All other lesions, including small lesions (longest diame ter <10 mm or pathological lymph nodes 
with ≥10  to <15 mm short axis), are considered nonmeasurable disease. Bone lesions, 
leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural/pericardial effusions, lymphangitis cutis/pulmonitis, 
inflammatory breast disease, and abdom inal masses (not followed by CT, MRI, or PET) are 
considered nonmeasurable.  
1.2.1.  Special Considerations  
Bone lesions:  
• Bone scan, PET scan or plain films are not considered adequate imaging techniques 
to measure bone lesions. However, these techniques can  be used to confirm the 
presence or disappearance of bone lesions.  
• Lytic bone lesions or mixed lytic -blastic lesions, with identifiable soft tissue 
components, that can be evaluated by cross sectional imaging techniques such as CT 
                                        VV-RIM-00164906-1.0 Approved - 31 Aug 2021 GMT-5:00
Clinical Study Protocol   R2810 -ONC -ISA-1981 Amendment 2  
 
 
Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.   Page 111 
 CONFIDENTIAL  or MRI can be considered measurable lesions if the soft tissue component meets the 
definition of measurability described above.  
• Blastic bone lesions are non -measurable.  
Cystic lesions:  
Cystic lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically defined simple cysts should not be 
considered malignant lesions (neither measurable nor nonmeasurable) since they are, by definition, 
simple cysts.  “Cystic lesions” thought to represent cystic metastases can be considered measurable 
lesions, if they meet the definition of measurability des cribed above.  However, if non -cystic 
lesions are present in the same patient, these are preferred for selection as target lesions.  
Lesions with prior local treatment:  
• Tumor lesions situated in a previously irradiated area, or in an area subjected to other  
locoregional therapy, are usually not considered measurable unless there has been 
demonstrated  progression in the lesion.  
1.3. Methods of Assessment  
All measurements must be recorded in metric notation, using calipers if clinically assessed. All 
baseline evaluations should be performed as closely as possible to the beginning of treatment and 
never more than 4 weeks before the beginning of the treatment.  
The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize each 
identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow -up.  Imaging -based evaluation is 
preferred to evaluation by clinical examination unless the lesion(s) being followed cannot be 
imaged but are assessable by clinical exam.  
• CT and MRI .  CT is the best currently a vailable and reproducible method to measure 
lesions selected for tumor assessment.  This guideline has defined measurability of 
lesions on CT scan based on the assumption that CT slice thickness is 5 mm or less. 
When CT scans have slice thickness greater t han 5 mm, the minimum size for a 
measurable lesion should be twice the slice thickness. MRI is also acceptable for body 
scans except chest. MRI is preferred for brain scans.  
1.4. Baseline Documentation of Target and Non -Target Lesions  
Target lesions:   When  more than one measurable lesion is present at baseline all lesions up to a 
maximum of five lesions total (and a maximum of two lesions per organ) representative of all 
involved organs should be identified as target lesions and will be recorded and measure d at 
baseline.  Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with larger size are 
generally preferred), be representative of all involved organs, have better defined boundaries, and 
should lend themselves to reproducible repeated m easurements.  
Lymph nodes merit special mention since they are normal anatomical structures which may be 
visible by imaging even if not involved by tumor.  Pathological nodes which are defined as 
measurable and may be identified as target lesions must meet the criterion of a short axis 
of ≥ 15 mm by CT or MRI scan. Only the short axis of these nodes will contribute to the baseline 
sum. All other pathological nodes (those with short axis  ≥10 mm but <15 mm) should be 
                                        VV-RIM-00164906-1.0 Approved - 31 Aug 2021 GMT-5:00

Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.   Page 112 
 CONFIDENTIAL  considered non -target lesions.  Nodes that have a short axis <10 mm are considered non -
pathological and should not be recorded or followed.  
A sum of the diameters (longest for non -nodal lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) for all target 
lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum  diameters. The baseline sum of 
diameters will be used as reference to further characterize any objective tumor regression in the 
measurable dimension of the disease.  
Non-target lesions:  All other lesions (or sites of disease) including pathological lymph  nodes 
should be identified as non -target lesions and should also be recorded at baseline.  Measurements 
of these lesions are not required, but the presence, absence, or, in rare cases, unequivocal 
progression of each should be noted throughout follow -up.  In addition, it is possible to record 
multiple non -target lesions involving the same organ as a single item on the case record form (e.g., 
‘multiple enlarged pelvic lymph nodes’ or ‘multiple liver metastases’).  
1.5. Response Criteria  
This section provides  the definitions of the criteria used to determine objective tumor response for 
target and non -target lesions.  
1.5.1.  Evaluation of Target Lesions  
• Complete Response (CR):   Disappearance of all target lesions.  Any pathological 
lymph nodes (whether target o r non -target) must have reduction in short axis to 
<10 mm (<1  cm). 
• Partial Response (PR):  At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target 
lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.  
• Progressive Disease (PD):  At least a 20% incr ease in the sum of the diameters of 
target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline 
sum if that is the smallest on study).  In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the 
sum must also demonstrate an absolute inc rease of at least 5 mm (0.5  cm). ( Note: the 
appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progressions).  
• Stable Disease:  Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase 
to qualify for progressive disease, taking as refere nce the smallest sum diameters while 
on study.  
Special notes on the assessment of target lesions:  
• Lymph nodes:  Lymph nodes identified as target lesions should always have the actual 
short axis measurement recorded and should be measured in the same anatom ical plane 
as the baseline examination, even if the nodes regress to below 10  mm on study.  This 
means that when lymph nodes are included as target lesions, the ‘sum’ of lesions may 
not be zero even if complete response criteria are met, since a normal lym ph node is 
defined as having a short axis of <10 mm.  
• Target lesions that become ‘too small to measure’:  All lesions (nodal and non -nodal) 
recorded at baseline should have their actual measurements recorded at each 
subsequent evaluation, even when very sma ll (eg, 2 mm).  If the radiologist is able to 
provide an actual measure, that should be recorded, even if it is below 5 mm. However, 
                                        VV-RIM-00164906-1.0 Approved - 31 Aug 2021 GMT-5:00
Clinical Study Protocol   R2810 -ONC -ISA-1981 Amendment 2  
 
 
Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.   Page 113 
 CONFIDENTIAL  when such a lesion becomes difficult to assign an exact measure to then:  (i)  if it is the 
opinion of the radiologist that the lesion has likely disappeared, the measurement 
should be recorded as 0 mm.  (ii) if the lesion is believed to be present and is faintly 
seen but too small to measure, a default value of 5 mm should be assigned (note:  in 
case of a lymph node believed t o be present and faintly seen but too small to measure, 
a default value of 5 mm should be assigned in this circumstance as well).  This default 
value is derived from the 5 mm CT slice thickness (but should not be changed with 
varying CT slice thickness).  
• Lesions that split or coalesce on treatment:  When non -nodal lesions ‘fragment’, the 
longest diameters of the fragmented portions should be added together to calculate the 
target lesion sum.  Similarly, as lesions coalesce, a plane between them may be 
maint ained that would aid in obtaining maximal diameter measurements of each 
individual lesion.  If the lesions have coalesced such that they are no longer separable, 
the vector of the longest diameter in this instance should be the maximal longest 
diameter for  the ‘coalesced lesion’.  
1.5.2.  Evaluation of Non -Target Lesions  
While some non -target lesions may actually be measurable, they need not be measured and instead 
should be assessed only qualitatively at the time points specified in the protocol.  
• Complete Response:  Disappearance of all nontarget lesions and normalization of 
tumor marker level.  All lymph nodes must be nonpathological in size (<10  mm short 
axis).  
• Non-CR/Non -PD:  Persistence of one or more nontarget lesion(s) and/or maintenance 
of tumor marker level above the normal limits.  
• Progressive Disease:  Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal 
progression of existing nontarget lesions.  Unequivocal progression should not 
normally trump target lesion status.  It must be repres entative of overall disease status 
change, not a single lesion increase.  
Although a clear progression of “nontarget” lesions only is exceptional, the opinion of the treating 
physician should prevail in such circumstances, and the progression status should be confirmed at 
a later time by the review panel (or investigator).  
1.6. New Lesions  
The appearance of new malignant lesions denotes disease progression; therefore, some comments 
on detection of new lesions are important. There are no specific criteria for  the identification of 
new radiographic lesions; however, the finding of a new lesion should be unequivocal:  i.e. not 
attributable to differences in scanning technique, change in imaging modality or findings thought 
to represent something other than tumor  (for example, some ‘new’ bone lesions may be simply 
healing or flare of pre -existing lesions).  This is particularly important when the patient’s baseline 
lesions show partial or complete response.  For example, necrosis of a liver lesion may be reported 
on a CT scan report as a ‘new’ cystic lesion, which it is not.  
A lesion identified on a follow -up study in an anatomical location that was not scanned at baseline 
is considered a new lesion and will indicate disease progression.  An example of this is the patient

reveals metastases.  The patient’s brain metastases are considered to be evidence of progressive 
disease even if he/she did not have brain imaging at baseli ne.  If a new lesion is equivocal, for 
example because of its small size, continued therapy and follow -up evaluation will clarify if it 
represents truly new disease.  If repeat scans confirm there is definitely a new lesion, then 
progression should be decl ared using the date of the initial scan.  
1.7. Evaluation of Best Overall Response  
The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the treatment until the end 
of treatment taking into account any requirement for confirmation.   T he patient's best response 
assignment will depend on the findings of both target and non -target disease and will also take into 
consideration the appearance of new lesions.  
Revised Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Version 1.1 (Eisenhauer, 2009 ) 
is summarized in the table below.

*For non -target disease, ‘non -CR/non -PD’ is preferred over ‘SD’ since SD is increasingly used as endpoint for 
assessment of efficacy in some trials, so to assign this categor y when no lesions can be measured is not advised.  
**In exceptional circumstances, unequivocal progression in non -target lesions may be accepted as PD.  
Note:   Patients with a global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of treatment witho ut objective 
evidence of disease progression at that time should be reported as “ symptomatic deterioration.”   Every effort should 
be made to document the objective progression even after discontinuation of treatment.

*If a CR is truly met at first time point, then any disease seen at a subsequent time point, even disease meeting PR 
criteria relative to baseline, makes the disease PD at that point (since disease must have reappeared after CR). Best 
response would depend on whether minimum duration for SD was met . However, sometimes ‘CR’ may be claimed 
when subsequent scans suggest small lesions were likely still present and in fact the patient had PR, not CR at the 
first time point. Under these circumstances, the original CR should be changed to PR and the best r esponse is PR.
